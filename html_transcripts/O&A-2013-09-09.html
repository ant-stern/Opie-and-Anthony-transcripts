<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opens with the usual irreverent banter between Opie, Anthony Cumia, and Jim Norton.  The weather leads to a discussion about the Earth's orbit, followed by Norton detailing a disastrous Chicago strip club gig, contrasting it with a Kevin Downey Jr. show featuring a played clip of Downey Jr.’s offensive rape jokes. Norton recounts his weekend, including a family gathering and his brother's play, highlighting family dynamics.  The conversation shifts to a Jets game, an obnoxious Jets fan, and a picture of Hulk Hogan seemingly making an obscene gesture at Jerry Jones, leading to a discussion of Brooke Hogan's attractiveness.  A clip of an awkward Eminem interview on ESPN’s College GameDay is played, prompting speculation about the reasons for the awkwardness and Eminem's career.  This transitions into a brief discussion of Michael Jackson's posthumous success. Norton then complains about a poorly-made 70s covers compilation album purchased on iTunes, transitioning into a discussion about Robert Reed's perceived homosexuality on *The Brady Bunch*, with clips played focusing on suggestive interactions between Tank and Carol Brady.  The segment concludes with a search for a missing firewire cable.

A subsequent segment focuses on the unemployment of radio personality Scorch and his social media efforts, including his wrestling appearances with Tito Santana and Tony Atlas.  The hosts mock Scorch’s endeavors and transition into discussions about the Bella Twins' reality show, a racially charged assault, media bias, celebrity scandals, privacy concerns in the age of the NSA, the impact of technology on job security, the increasing prevalence of automation and robots, and the use of CGI in media.  Norton's upcoming talk show is mentioned several times.

The next segment begins with a discussion about holographic musicians, specifically Eazy-E, and speculation about his death and sexuality.  This segues into a broader discussion about the future of technology and the displacement of humans by robots and holograms, including motion capture technology. A significant portion details a less-than-ideal weekend trip to Opie's Hamptons beach house by Roland and another unnamed individual, including a ruined sandcastle and a disastrous steak-cooking attempt.  The conversation shifts to Anthony's internet-famous cat known for removing Anthony's glasses, followed by vulgar and disrespectful jokes about an elderly couple from a Lee and Morty commercial, culminating in fictional scenarios involving their demise.

The following segment begins with an unsuccessful attempt to contact a "hot couple" from the news, leading to a discussion about the older couple from Swiffer commercials. A caller identifying himself as Edgar Mellencamp discusses his Twitter activity, receiving disparaging remarks from the hosts.  A phone conversation with Bill Burr follows, discussing his role in *Breaking Bad*, his Patriots fandom, and NFL scheduling.  Other topics include Robin Quivers' cancer battle, Scott Thorson's arrest, the hosts' opinions on the NFL, Syria's use of chemical weapons, Bill Burr's reading habits (including "Flyboys"), a critique of anorexic YouTuber Eugenia Cooney and her twerking videos, and interactions with studio guests and hallway individuals.  The segment ends with discussion of Burr’s upcoming *Tonight Show* appearance.

The final segment starts with a discussion of Robin Williams' return to television, followed by criticism of the live-action *Popeye* movie and Stanley Kubrick's alleged treatment of Shelley Duvall.  The conversation moves to actors transitioning to sitcoms, prompting discussion of Giovanni Ribisi in *Ted*.  A Mama Mancini's Meatballs commercial interrupts, followed by Sam Roberts discussing his 30th birthday celebration, including a dinner at Guy Fieri's restaurant, receiving numerous Happy Socks, and a bizarre self-likeness birthday cake.  Roberts details his participation in a women's boot camp, including vomiting during the first session, leading to listener calls, debates about men and women’s physical strength, and humorous anecdotes.  The segment includes discussion of a past Opie and Anthony fitness challenge, the hosts' wives' fitness levels, an exchange with Kenny (a recurring caller), and Kenny's behavior at Roberts' wedding.  The show ends with social media plugs. Bob Kelly was a guest in the studio during this segment.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  New York City, 6 a.m.  An out-of-control satellite radio show is being broadcasted to millions of Americans.  At the controls, Opie, the father.  Oh, this is perfect. This is how it should be.  Anthony Cumia, an alcoholic.  Hey, hi.  And Jim Norton, a comedian.  It's me! I work here!  Glad I got that one out.  Are we on? Live? No? Is it happening? This is it?  The three men make up the Opie and Anthony show,  a popular radio program known for its cream style of entertainment. 
[00:00:30]  and having very few limits.  I like where this is going. I'm seeing a lot of options here.  This is different than any other radio.  Don't tell them what we're going to hear in here today.  Tits, ass, tons of cuss words.  It's not like radio. It's like hanging out.  In the past, they have been accused of multiple FCC violations  and have even gotten their show suspended from satellite radio.  This is why. This is American freedom of speech.  It's good on every level.  And saying.  Every second is funny.  Wildly funny.  And philosophically spotless.  Everything you are about to hear is real. 
[00:01:00]  Real people. Real people. Real excitement.  This is the Opie and Anthony show.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  I think we've got to turn up the master headphone thing.  Yeah.  A little more.  Oh, there we go.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Hi, everybody. 
[00:01:30]  Hope everybody's weekend was, uh, fan spasticle.  Have a lot of fun?  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  Everything work?  Good.  Well, Opie and Anthony show.  Every Monday.  We're going to kick you to Mondays.  I guess, uh, Opie's, uh, taking one of them extended, uh, weekends.  It's still the summer. 
[00:02:00]  Eh, it's fucking chilly out.  Yeah, I know.  It's not quite.  Eh, it's just the worst.  Walk out and go like, ah, yeah, this is only going to get a lot worse.  And then it's going to be 88 on Wednesday.  Ooh.  88.  Crazy.  Nice.  Yeah, it was, uh, it was a little nippier, uh, this morning than it has been.  And it's dark again and fucking, so.  How frail is life?  Like, fucking, you think about it, it's like September now and it's getting a bit chillier. 
[00:02:30]  Yeah.  Like, almost, it's on cue that we're in the middle of fucking a vacuum of space and we're  next to a fucking star that could just destroy us.  Yeah.  And, and we turned just like the right amount of inches or feet that now that there's a  chillier weather that like in the vacuum of space is, oh, it's, it's 10 degrees colder.  Like, it's, it's like they, in space you're dealing in fucking in tens of thousands of  degrees, you know, fucking 400,000 degrees, the sun or whatever, a million degrees. 
[00:03:00]  And it varies a few degrees based on that.  Yeah, I, I, I was, uh, I was thinking of that with the, um, with the oceans and the  tides and, and storms that wipe out like houses and whatnot.  And it's like, you could build houses right on the beach and, and these oceans giant and,  and, and, and little waves are laughing at the, uh, at the shore.  And, and for the most part, you know, the houses are okay.  And then every so often there's a storm, but it really amounts to nothing like the, the 
[00:03:30]  ocean isn't moving.  It should be wiping out like hundreds of miles inland.  And then for like, you don't even know where the, where it's going to end, but everything's  pretty, pretty tight.  If you think about it, we literally, we turn enough where we, we, we, we move an inch farther  from the giant fireball and, and we have to now wear hats, a giant fireball, but it's  fucking so precise.  This fucking system.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Can you imagine if like whatever it is that moves us in space is what, and instead of an 
[00:04:00]  inch or two feet moved us three miles, or whatever, or whatever, or what, and fucked  up our orbit would suck.  And, and just, you know, instead of, instead of that little, it's now going to be, uh, you  know, 1400 below zero.  We, we are, we do depend on, um, some real consistency in a chaotic little, little thing  that's, uh, that the, the universe is.  And we just fucking sit here and, and hope you just go, you know, you wake up every day 
[00:04:30]  and, and you hope there isn't some hiccup in the works.  You hope the earth is going to keep, you know, just fucking spinning.  Yeah.  It's like some stoner talk.  Yeah.  But I thought of that when we were leaving work the other day, like how fucking amazing  it is that it knows.  Yeah.  It was like September 1st or 2nd or whatever, and it was like, God damn it, it's a little  nippier.  It gets a little chilly because it just fucking knows.  How is that?  They figured out this system pretty fucking well.  Like, why, why can't it be all of a sudden, uh, it's October. 
[00:05:00]  Fuck, it's still 90.  I guess they're a little weird this year.  Yeah.  It never happens.  No.  You get those fluke days, but never like that.  Oh, it's a hundred degrees on Halloween.  No, never.  How was everybody's weekend?  Do anything fun?  Fuck yeah.  Yeah?  What'd you do?  No.  No.  No.  I went to Chicago.  Yeah.  How was that?  You went for like 15 hours.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I was in and out with, uh, Kenny. 
[00:05:30]  And I haven't done a strip club gig in, in, in over 20 years.  What?  20 years, maybe.  And, uh, so they, uh, asked me to do this club called Club Allure.  Ooh.  It's a grand opening.  It was the second night it was open.  Mm-hmm.  And, um, the, uh, club itself was beautiful.  I wouldn't say for comedy it's ready yet.  Uh.  Oh.  Yeah.  It was one of those things where, uh, I did probably 25 to 27 minutes. 
[00:06:00]  Mm-hmm.  And I'm supposed to do 30.  And I think there might have been a chuckle at the 11 minute point.  What?  Like, what was, who was in the crowd?  Like, what made up the crowd?  It was, uh, well, the crowd was, you know, it was half full, three quarters full.  It was actually, you know, a lot of pretty girls.  The girls were amazing.  Uh-huh.  And, uh, eh, you know, who wants to listen to Jim Norton?  Oh, did they want to see titties?  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  But no, no one heckled. 
[00:06:30]  No.  It was really a weird thing.  Because there was nobody yelling anything.  It wasn't like it was this unruly, shitty, I couldn't even get mad at the crowd.  Uh-huh.  It was almost like I had walked into a dinner party and went, shh.  And they all went, no, no, we're eating and talking.  Oh, no.  And so I did the material, but, uh, nobody really listened.  But it was almost like it just wasn't, it's bizarre to have a set that, where the crowd  is that disinterested in me.  Damn. 
[00:07:00]  And I don't get angry at.  Like, I left and I was like, uh, nah.  The owner's like, ah, man, we're just getting started.  I'm like, it's cool.  You know, the club itself was really nice and the girls were fucking smoking and, you  know.  What's the thinking behind having a comedian at a strip club?  Well, it's more, honestly, the thinking was, they used to do that for a year.  It's more like a cabaret or a variety thing.  And a lot of them used to do it.  Like, you know, I was thinking that like Pryor and all those guys came up through strip clubs.  They all did them years ago. 
[00:07:30]  But it was much more accepted, I think, back then.  It was much more of a, he wants, he's looking for more like a Vegas because he's run a bunch  of clubs.  He wants more of a cabaret type feel than just a typical strip club.  He wants it to kind of feel different.  But this night, because I would have promoted it publicly and had fans come.  I just didn't know I could do that.  Yeah, yeah.  So it was one of those weird things.  But I was, I was rare to have a set that you don't, you're not happy with.  Yeah.  That you're not annoyed at either.  It was really weird.  Wow.  I wasn't even mildly hurt. 
[00:08:00]  I think, ah, fucking fun.  But I was even looking at the girls to stand there going, I'd rather fuck her than listen  to me.  I don't blame them.  I went to Governor's on a Saturday.  Oh, who'd you see?  I saw, I just wanted to go out and see a comic, you know, whatever.  So I just picked a close place.  And it was that guy from, I guess he was on America's Got Talent.  That, uh, Kevin Downey.  Oh, Kevin Downey Jr.  Kevin Downey Jr.  What is it with the Downey and the Jr. all the time?  I don't know.  I guess the figure's syndrome doesn't sound right after.  Yeah, I know Kevin. 
[00:08:30]  I haven't seen him in years.  He's, uh, he had a brother who used to perform, too.  Yeah?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I know exactly.  Yeah.  And you know what?  He was pretty fucking funny.  He was?  Yeah.  Yeah, he's got a gimmick thing going on.  Yeah, he didn't last that long on America's Got Talent.  No, no.  But he was telling jokes that, uh, that they told him he couldn't do on TV.  And, yeah, he's pretty fucking twisted.  It wasn't bad.  I liked it.  Yeah, I don't remember his, I haven't seen him perform in a war.  Yeah, he does a weird, uh, like, what's the gimmick? 
[00:09:00]  Yeah, like, like, it's like, uh, he'll just talk like, and today I got a talk.  Yeah, he has a weird, by the way, it's this weird character.  Yeah, yeah, and he's got that Neil Diamond hairdo, and, uh, yeah, it was pretty good, though.  Is that him?  Pat was his brother's name.  Was it?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I, I, I, and the crowd, there was, like, no one there.  It was, like, fucking pretty empty.  And, uh, the people that were there, um, again, like, like you, not, uh, not really into being, 
[00:09:30]  why do they go?  Well, that's a comedy club.  I know, that's a comedy club.  Exactly.  I can, I can understand why you'd go to the Allure Strip Club and want to see hot girls  and not a fucking comedian in a blazer.  Exactly.  But why would you go to Governor's?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't know.  It's very weird.  Hear a little of this.  Let's have a nice sleep, quick!  Yeah, this is, from America's Got Talent.  Joke number two! 
[00:10:00]  I bought this new cologne, one with, women can't say now.  It's called chloroform.  Rape joke.  Yeah.  Rape joke.  Like a good rape joke.  Yeah.  I like to sleep with Amish women.  And he wasn't this over the top.  That way, I can't call him the next day.  I guess they're not, the judges aren't really liking him. 
[00:10:30]  It's a, the female judges.  I've got a tattoo on my butt.  And it says, if you can read this, I'm in prison.  That's a good joke.  Prison rape joke.  I was on a blind date.  Didn't start off like that, but the chick brought pepper spray. 
[00:11:00]  All right.  Some more, more rape.  Another sexual assault joke.  Yes.  That's my time.  Thank you, Radio City Music Hall.  And that's all I...  And thank you, America!  Wait, is, oh, this just happened.  Like a few weeks ago.  Oh.  Yep.  Yeah.  I'm very grateful to be here.  Did he screech like that?  Hi, YouTube.  A couple of times.  I can't tell you how much fun I am.  A couple of times.  I remember when he started.  I don't remember if that was something that he always did.  It might have been.  I just don't remember back then.  We used to do fucking Open Mice Rascals together in fucking...  Really?  Yeah, like 94. 
[00:11:30]  Damn, you've been doing this a while, Jimmy.  Oh, fuck, dude.  Whenever I say over 20 years and mean it, it's fucking miserable.  Yeah.  It's miserable.  And then Friday, oh, boy, Friday, I went to Port Jeff.  They're in Port Jeff.  My brother was playing some plays.  And a bunch of relatives, like cousins and uncles and aunts and shit like that from my  dad's side of the family.  Don't get to see them very often.  They got some great stories, too. 
[00:12:00]  You know.  They enjoy listening to this program and listening to my, you know, convey the stories of pop.  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And they're like, oh, yeah, that was your father.  Oh, boy.  Oh, yeah.  They always got that, oh, story.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  And you see the guys that, like, you used to hang out with.  Like, I remember these guys from when they were, you know.  In your bedroom after you fell asleep. 
[00:12:30]  Oh, feeling that rough beard.  It's my tender boy skin.  Yeah.  And the smell of Pabst Blue Ribbon.  And High Karate.  Yeah, but it's interesting.  Really is something.  You got two sides of a family, you know.  You got your mom's side and your dad's side.  It's amazing how different they are, you know.  Do you hang out with, like, do you know anybody from your mom's side and your dad's side?  Because in my family, my mom's side was always, like, more kind of straightforward, kind of, you know, here's what we do. 
[00:13:00]  As a kid, I always thought of them as the more boring side of the family.  My dad's side was a fucking just insane fucking, like, every day was a party and, you know, there's people all over the place and chicks and barbecues and shit.  Same thing, yeah.  Yeah?  Mom's side a little bit more reserved when, you know, upper universities in Massachusetts, my father's side was more, like, fucking blue-collar. 
[00:13:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Relatable.  That's fucking weird.  And then you're just thrown into this mix of, like, different people.  Yeah, because two people decide to fuck.  Yeah.  Here's now a hundred other people that have to get along.  Yeah, that have nothing to, like, do with each other.  They would have never gotten together, you know, under any other circumstance, except your parents wanted to fuck.  Yeah.  That's all it's about.  There's people that might have normally, like, one group probably would have attacked the other group and caved their heads in, called them faggots and beat them and taken their shit. 
[00:14:00]  But, well, no.  Someone's got to do this.  Shit.  And then, I guess, over the weekend, some stories or whatever was on TV.  I guess football kicked off, right?  Yeah.  What happened?  I saw some tweets.  I saw some tweets about, what, the Giants?  Did they suck?  Oh, I don't know.  No, the Cowboys won.  That's why I sent out a really fun tweet.  I saw your tweet there, Jimmy.  You're bleeding Cowboy Blue.  Yeah.  Now, as I recall, you were cursing the Cowboys. 
[00:14:30]  Yes, but it's also bleeding Giant Blue.  I love the fact that it was such a douchey thing to tweet.  It was a douchey sports tweet.  It was after a great, well, I think it was an interception or something.  Yeah.  I was always, you know, I'm always happy to see the Cowboys win.  Yeah.  Yeah, and Romo didn't fucking blow it, so.  How did the home teams do?  Jets.  Or team, yeah.  The Jets actually won.  Ooh.  In, like, the final seconds.  Oh, wow.  Really?  Was it exciting? 
[00:15:00]  I don't know.  I took my dog out because I thought the game was over.  Oh, no.  Oops.  They had, like, 30 seconds, and they're trying to march down the field with their rookie  quarterback.  But if they're going, if they have the ball and it's 30 seconds, why would you leave?  This is over.  Oh, no.  And I don't care.  I'm not a Jets fan.  I'm just, you know.  Okay.  Yeah, I wouldn't care either, but, like, if you're there and you could see, like, maybe  this is going to be kind of a cool ending.  No.  I didn't care that much, and we'd just gotten home, and he wanted to go out, so I was like,  oh.  Oh.  And, yeah, they ended up, they beat the Bucs 18-17. 
[00:15:30]  How'd they come back?  Did you just, uh...  I think they got enough penalty yards that they could kick, like, a 48-yard field goal.  Oh, it was a field goal.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I was in the gym during the afternoon, and just Jets fans are the worst.  I'm in the gym, and I'm just doing my abs, because, you know, that's what a guy does.  And I hear a...  Sure.  Yeah!  There's fucking some asshole in a green shirt and a backward Jets hat on the bike, yelling  in the gym, because he's watching.  Oh, God.  He's getting him on the fucking... 
[00:16:00]  In the gym?  And it's like, we're in a public...  I got annoyed, and I'm like, maybe I'm a douche, because I'm a football fan, and I know  what it's like to get excited.  Yeah.  But just seeing him there in his Jets hat, getting all loud, and fucking clapping, nobody gives  a shit.  Fucking shut up.  Like, they're in sports bars.  Or something.  But it wouldn't have bothered me if it was a fan of the Giants, but it's just something  about a Jets fan.  Like, you knew he had to be a loud Jets fan.  He was being typical, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, one of those typical Jets fans. 
[00:16:30]  Did you see the photo that went around?  The Cowboys reminded me of Hulk Hogan and LeBron with the Cowboys owner.  Oh, look it up.  It's so douchey.  Yeah?  Yeah, LeBron...  I guess Hogan and LeBron were up in...  Jerry Jones.  Yeah, Jerry Jones' box.  And, like, they took a...  Up in Jerry Jones' box!  They took a photo together, and Hogan is pointing at Jerry Jones' crotch.  At his dick or something.  It looks like maybe he was just going, oh, here's, you know, here's the man.  No, I think he was doing the, like, suck it thing. 
[00:17:00]  Oh, was he?  Because he does that sometimes.  The what?  The suck it thing.  You know when guys point to their crotches and go, suck it?  Yeah.  But he's Jerry Jones.  Was he doing that or no?  I think so.  He's pointing directly at the dude's crotch.  Jerry Jones has no idea what's going on.  Even though they're not looking at the camera that took this picture.  Right.  Well, Hulk has to cover up everything.  He's got to wear his sunglasses.  He's got to put the bandana over his fucking three wisps of hay hair that he has left.  LeBron probably wouldn't have even taken that photo if he'd known Hulk was going to point 
[00:17:30]  at Jerry Jones' dick.  I don't think LeBron would have cared.  It's Hulk Hogan.  Yeah?  Yeah, man.  Fucking, everyone loves Hulk Hogan and wrestlers.  Thunder lips.  Yeah, no one doesn't want to take a picture with Hulk Hogan.  Yeah.  Let me put your dick, brother.  This would be great.  Let me hold that for you, LeBron.  Did you see my dick in that film, brother?  It's like a soda can.  Oh, Brooke Hogan is engaged to a Cowboys player.  That's why he was in the game.  Really?  She's sexy, man.  She's engaged to Cowboys center Phil Costa. 
[00:18:00]  God fucking, she is sexy, man.  Yeah, she is.  I want to have sex with a giant.  She's a big.  Bully Ray.  Yeah, way to break kayfabe.  Oh, no.  She's a big, long-legged gal.  Big, juicy height.  Oh, yeah.  Brooke Hogan is fucking juicy.  I couldn't, but I would bore her immediately.  I would just want to be like a little baby.  Like, we would have sex.  I would want her to lay on her back, and I would want to lay between her with my feet  going like this, like kicking.  Like goo-goo-ga-ga feet?  Like, while I was having sex with her, and I would put my face in her breasts. 
[00:18:30]  That would be like a real mothering, nurturing, big-bosomed gal.  Yeah.  She is hot for a...  Oh, my God.  Because she's big.  Yeah.  So, like, if she was normal size, I don't think she would be as hot.  Oh.  You know, you kind of give her the benefit of the doubt because she's big.  She's at least six foot.  She's got to be.  Okay.  Five-11.  No, she's got to be taller than that.  Oh, that's what they say.  Long heighty.  Six-two. 
[00:19:00]  Wow.  Sex with a giant.  And then, what happened with Eminem?  I didn't get...  Did we have this?  Yeah.  Because I heard...  I didn't click on it because I could really give a shit at the time.  But apparently, I guess, Eminem was on ESPN.  He was on, yeah, one of the...  He was on Saturday Night Football.  The Lions game, right?  Yeah.  And all I hear is this interview is awkward. 
[00:19:30]  So awkward.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Sorry.  College football.  Yeah.  He was on...  I guess he was in promoting his album, but between the broadcasters not knowing anything  about him...  Oh, no.  Football fans obviously don't care.  No, they don't.  The whole...  It just seemed out of place.  He's got the big, bulky sports headset on.  That only works if he's, like, a real sports fanatic talking about a sport that he really  likes, and the album becomes this incidental part of the interview. 
[00:20:00]  Right.  Like, oh, yeah, and I got an album out, too.  Then people are like, oh, cool, but it's kind of hard when you're there to promote something  specifically.  Yeah, yeah.  And he was making faces that I guess didn't really work.  Nobody knew what he was doing.  Oh, no.  Uh-oh.  Could you move that little microphone forward?  The boss, how about this?  Move it forward, the boss said.  Thank you.  You're too nice.  And there we go.  Okay, so Eminem.  Oh, and then that guy.  Brent Musburger.  He's with Brent Musburger.  Right.  I'll have the Musburger, please.  Yeah.  Delicious.  It's a burger, and it's all nicely made, then you must it up. 
[00:20:30]  Yeah, I got it.  Okay.  There's, like, a minute longer clip on.  Oh, well, we want the minute longer one.  Yeah, you gotta find Eminem's.  More clip.  It's better for the listener.  That's right.  It's more entertainment.  For the listener.  Eminem.  Okay.  All right, here we go.  Starting next week at 8 Eastern on ABC, Marshall Mathers will open Saturday Night Football.  Mathers, it's a pleasure. 
[00:21:00]  I called him Mathers.  Marshall, it's a pleasure to be here, and it's an honor to be able to do that, so.  So you have the single albums coming out in November.  What are you most excited about with this new album?  Nothing.  Nothing?  No.  I'm going to be out November 5th.  I'll probably be most excited to just be done with it.  Yeah.  But, yeah, I mean, it's called the Marshall Mathers LP, too.  And it's kind of a revisit to the first Marshall Mathers LP. 
[00:21:30]  And that's pretty much all I can probably say about it.  But one final question before you leave.  Before you leave.  This is what my friends in Montana wanted me to ask you.  Will the Lions cover four and a half tomorrow against Minnesota?  Will the Lions cover four and a half?  Yeah.  I'm not sure, man.  I don't want to.  I don't ever make a prediction on the Lions because I don't ever want to jinx it. 
[00:22:00]  But I'm such a diehard Lions fan, like, to the core.  So, yes, they'll win.  That's all you're saying.  Oh.  I'm hoping I didn't just jinx it.  But this is the kickoff question.  Stick right here with us now.  See, they're trying to call the game.  Like, he was supposed to wrap up a lot quicker.  Uh-huh.  So, the game started.  It was a bugger, haven't you?  Absolutely.  And, Brett, just like, you know, they have fantasy football or whatever.  I got you on my fantasy announcer team. 
[00:22:30]  It would be you and, of course, the late, great Pat Summerall and John Madden and Al Michaels.  If you guys would get together and just call the game.  Kirk, you're great, too.  Much respect.  I appreciate it.  Not quite to that status yet.  I get it.  Right.  But now there's another play going down.  John Madden just called one Lions game.  They just wanted to get rid of him.  The Super Bowl probably would be great.  You mean so?  Yeah, and he wouldn't leave.  Man, that would be...  Marshall, they're telling us you have to go. 
[00:23:00]  Yes.  You are a legend, my friend.  Thank you.  Thank you.  You are the legend, my friend.  13 Grammys, first rap song to win an Academy Award.  An original score.  You've sold 100 million records worldwide.  You, Marshall.  Madden, he called them.  Yes.  I'm really uncomfortable right now.  Marshall, take care, my friend.  We look forward to seeing that video next week.  Thank you.  Marshall.  Marshall.  They didn't call him Eminem once.  No.  No, no.  They didn't call him Eminem once.  They don't know who he is. 
[00:23:30]  How do you not know who Eminem is?  You don't listen to it.  Brent Musburger, you could tell, was just reading off his bio.  Yeah.  You know, rap song Academy Award.  You know what, Dobby?  They said Eminem's coming, and then they saw Marshall Mathers, and they just didn't understand.  They're like, oh, okay, Marshall.  What?  Who's Eminem?  I thought it was going to be one of those big stuffed mascot things, and we were going to talk  about a great chocolatey treat.  Yeah, that was a little awkward.  And because they were just getting, obviously, questions piped into their headset when Eminem 
[00:24:00]  didn't give them anything.  No.  They didn't know what the follow-up was, so whoever's in their headset is just going through  papers like, ah, now ask him.  Just ask him this.  The best is when Eminem goes, I'm really uncomfortable right now.  I like a good, honest interview.  Yes.  And he's just not good with accepting praise.  He's also very awkward to begin with.  He's a weird guy, I guess.  He doesn't do a lot of interviews.  No, he does not.  No, you don't really see him on a lot of interview shows.  So this was probably something that he was kind of pushed into doing.  Yeah, you think?  It wasn't exactly TRL, though. 
[00:24:30]  No.  Yeah, why would you agree to do that and not do something that's a little more conducive  and a little more in your demo?  Because I assume the money that he's being paid by ESPN to use his song, I assume that.  Oh, is that?  Yeah.  Something where they're like, get your ass down here.  That's part of it.  Yeah.  And he knows, too, that they're not going to ask him anything controversial or anything  he doesn't want to talk about in a person or whatever.  They're not going to say, so, you're a drug addiction.  Right.  So if you're, talk to your moms.  Right.  How about the pills? 
[00:25:00]  He'd probably talk about all that stuff.  Yeah.  He wouldn't even talk about his album.  Yeah.  Why not?  Exactly.  He wouldn't even talk about his album.  He's probably better at talking about stuff like the other shit you'd probably get more  out of them on.  Yeah.  Yeah, if he's thinking about it, why would he have always been a pretty private person?  Yeah.  Yeah, really?  He doesn't like to talk.  Which is weird, because he puts everything in his songs.  Yeah.  He says what he needs to say.  Yeah, man.  To make my art.  Yeah.  But don't ask me about it.  You know, I won't give you an answer.  That fucking made a hundred million records. 
[00:25:30]  He's the only guy to outsell the Beatles since 2000.  Really?  Yeah.  I read that a couple years ago.  The Beatles is still, first of all, the most impressive thing is the Beatles are still the  number one selling band ever.  Crazy.  Consistently.  I thought it was Slim Whitman.  Whatever it is, since 2000.  Yeah.  I thought it was Slim Whitman.  Oh, maybe more than the Beatles.  Are you kidding?  No.  Oh.  Dumb am I.  Are you kidding?  But that was such a fucking weird one, it just might have been the truth.  They used to say that on his commercials or something.  He sold more records than the Beatles and Elvis combined. 
[00:26:00]  And you're like, no, that can't be true.  Slim Whitman?  No one talks about Slim Whitman.  Slim Whitman.  No.  Not as much as they should.  Oh, you're the Louisville.  Oh, Rosemary.  Unless he was on some best of album that outsold everything.  But no, fuck yeah.  No, there's no way.  Guy sold nine records.  There's no way.  And the part, and before that interview, like, they were talking about the game.  And Eminem was just staring at the camera, like, ugh. 
[00:26:30]  Oh, really?  Was he as a goofy thing?  I guess, yeah.  But, like, he didn't really laugh that much after.  He was like, oh, sorry.  Live TV makes me nervous.  And then he just kept going.  It was just weird.  He is a weirdo.  Yeah, he's weird.  Yeah, he is.  That's Slim Whitman.  God.  He died?  Yeah, he's dead.  Who did you think he was?  Fuck.  Oh, he died in June.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, he was around for a while.  That fucking gay.  Yeah.  Robert Klein had a very funny Slim Whitman bit. 
[00:27:00]  Really?  Yeah, Robert Klein at Yale.  That's all I have on that.  See, let me know him.  I was watching, I guess, 60 Minutes, and they were doing a thing on Michael Jackson,  and the fact that he's made so much money since he's been dead.  Like, he's grossing more money dead than he had been alive for quite a while, and more  than, like, many living, very popular artists.  He just, he's not spending is what it is. 
[00:27:30]  He used to spend so much fucking money that he was in debt, like, 300 million bucks when  he died, but he still had all his shit and stuff.  They have three or four warehouses full of shit of his personal items, and they were  going through it and opening up boxes, and it's like, here's his glove, here's his sequined  jacket, and there's just cars in one warehouse and shit.  This fucking guy has so much shit, and money just keeps pouring in. 
[00:28:00]  Remember that Martin Bashir documentary when he was going to that gold store in Vegas?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's like, yeah, I'll take that, and I'll take two of those.  He's spending a lot of money.  Buying golden chess boards and giant suits of armor, and...  Just an asshole.  Nonsense.  Just an asshole.  Just an asshole.  He wasn't making new music that was selling.  He was just kept spending.  No, no.  They said he was, he continued to spend like it was still the 80s. 
[00:28:30]  Yeah.  Like, when he was, like, fuck it, at the pinnacle.  Thriller fucking shit, you know?  But all those old songs, on top of not spending anymore, completely blew up again the minute  he died.  Yeah.  All that shit.  And then him owning the Beatles catalog.  Fucking just so much money.  Wow.  He's got that Cirque show, and that makes a ton of money for him.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And the movie came out after he died.  Yep.  Yeah, the movie came out, and that kind of had this huge, they started using his songs 
[00:29:00]  again, and sponsors started using them.  He's sold 50 million albums since he's died.  Wow.  50 million albums.  And nobody's selling albums anymore.  It's amazing.  Nobody sells albums.  And since he's dead, you can't really, you don't even, no one brings up any of the controversy  anymore, because it's like, oh, it doesn't matter, because he's dead.  Right.  So.  Let him rest in peace.  It's the perfect storm of selling a bunch of fucking shit.  Right.  Amazing.  I bought a greatest hits record.  I was walking through the village one night. 
[00:29:30]  It might have been right after he died, or maybe it was even he was alive.  And I heard some fucking car, it was last year, two years ago, and the window  was open, and the beat was blasting out the fucking window, and it sounded great, because  it was so retro and so fucking 30-year-old.  Yeah.  It just sounded, that doesn't sound douchey, like, you know, in 84 on, yeah, if you were  playing this, after a certain point, it just didn't sound right.  Like, it sounded weird, and like, ugh, yeah.  Yeah.  But it fucking just sounded great. 
[00:30:00]  It sounds the shit.  Yeah, but enough time has passed.  Yeah, but it wasn't the shit.  Like, if you listen to this in 85 or 87, like, even, even like 90, like, it'd be like,  it wasn't enough time has passed to make it, like, a classic thing.  Right now, it'd be like, listen to some fucking, what's a cheesy song from a few years ago that  you heard someone play?  This would be like, this would be like hearing a guy playing, I kissed a girl, blasting out  his window.  Macarena?  Huh?  The Macarena.  Yeah, there you go.  The Macarena.  Right.  But this is a good one.  Woo! 
[00:30:30]  It's got a lot of great songs.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's a star, just well.  Yeah.  Jesus.  Right.  Jesus.  Relax.  Party going on here.  Huh?  Fucking party.  I went and bought, I wanted to get a 70s compilation kind of a thing from my phone, you know?  70s compilation from iTunes, and I downloaded one by mistake of covers of 70s tunes.  It's so, I'm so angry. 
[00:31:00]  What's it called?  Fuck.  Because I haven't even taken it off of my phone yet, so as I'm listening to some shit, it'll  come up, one of the songs, I'll be like, ah, God, and they're just awful versions of...  Just swipe and delete it.  I know.  It's really easy.  Yeah.  But what is it, like all songs that they paid studio musicians next to nothing to perform  and then just throw it on a compilation?  So they went out to pay the rights to these fucking songs.  What the hell is this?  Hold on.  They're just off by a couple notes, like Vanilla Ice is under pressure. 
[00:31:30]  Ding, ding.  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding,  Let me see.  Michael Jackson, by the way, when he died, he was half a billion in debt.  Half a billion in debt.  Fuck yeah.  And, uh, and now it's fucking just amazing.  Could you cover that, Chip?  What was that?  You could have helped him out.  I'm trying to find this, uh, horrible, horrible 70s fucking...  It's when you go to buy something and you don't realize it's all the colors.  How awful.  How fucking offensive. 
[00:32:00]  This is so bad.  And even though it's only like 10 bucks or whatever, you feel it's the worst decision you've  ever made in your life.  Like, you'll never see that $10 again.  Like, I can't believe...  Yeah, you feel like you just handed your money to that birdie made off.  Yeah.  Fucking...  Yeah.  You want to call iTunes and be like, I would never have purchased this album legitimately.  I'll call it like this.  Nice.  It sounds like a fucking...  It sounds like they're playing it in the Addams Family house.  On that calliope or whatever the fuck it is. 
[00:32:30]  Alright, let's...  It's not the Eagle!  Sonically, it's not quite the same.  No!  And then, and then you...  What about the lyrics to this?  This must be a live version or something.  What?  It really does sound like it's being played in ancient fucking England.  Oh, like on a...  Yes.  Is there singing?  Uh, yeah.  Yeah.  Bad.  So, this far into it, are you going...  What is this, a different version? 
[00:33:00]  Yeah, I was like, oh, no.  I knew right away.  I'm like, oh, no.  This sounds weird.  Yeah.  Alright, here he goes.  Oh.  It's...  Cool wind in my head.  This is like the Glee version.  Yeah.  The smell of Kalitas rising up through the air.  They just wanted to get somebody that kind of sounds like them.  Yeah.  Sort of.  I was so angry.  It's not even like a rethinking or it's just like... 
[00:33:30]  No, a reimagining.  No, nothing like that.  Well, if we pay the bare minimum to some studio musicians who kind of sound like them, maybe...  Yeah.  Some people will be tricked into buying this.  And it all sounds the same, the music.  Oh, it is.  Hey, wait.  This isn't even Hotel California.  It sounded like it.  It sounds the same.  Yeah.  Angie.  Angie.  Yeah.  Oh.  It's the same douche.  Angie.  Why would anyone want this? 
[00:34:00]  Yeah, I just want a cover of the song.  I don't believe that.  There is...  I never even thought of that.  There's a whole business that's just designed to get tricking people into buying albums.  And it's trickery.  It's what it is.  It was trickery.  This is robbery.  I have...  Now, next time, I will be a lot more attentive to seeing if this is real or fake.  Yeah.  But they got me once, so that's all they needed to do.  They got me.  Fool me twice.  You can't fool me again.  Okay. 
[00:34:30]  Won't fool again.  Yeah.  Fool me once.  Shame on you.  Fool me twice.  And you can't...  Don't fool again.  Yeah.  Exactly right.  Wow.  Yeah, yeah.  So there's a whole industry...  It's just for tricking.  Just to fuck you over.  Like, maybe we can fool this person into giving us $10.  Yeah.  We'll fool one person.  They'll be on to me after this, but...  I mean, it's no different than telling...  Than somebody saying, if you give me a dollar, I'll do this.  And then you give them a dollar, and they just run away. 
[00:35:00]  Yeah.  It's the same shit.  Exactly.  It's trickery.  Let's do...  Robbery.  Yeah.  How about Ain't No Sunshine?  Oh, that's a good song.  Ain't no sunshine when she's gone.  Then they got some black-sounding guy.  It's not warm when she's away.  Which version is this?  The terrible one.  Dude, I can only...  John Vailby ruined this song for me.  Yeah, yeah.  Ain't no pussy when she's gone.  It's my hand while she's away. 
[00:35:30]  All I hear...  He's destroyed certain...  Yeah, certain songs.  But I'll listen to the song, and I just hear Vailby, and I'd rather listen to Vailby singing.  It's my hand when she's away.  And then he goes...  When my dick don't get no service, my dog gets really nervous.  And I'm trying to listen to a lovely song.  Oh, yes.  That's all you're thinking of.  How mad did you get when you realized the whole album?  Did you start going track by track?  Like, there's got to be one real song on here.  And I knew I'd made a horrid purchase, and I was not going to be able to enjoy any of the songs on this album. 
[00:36:00]  iTunes should outlaw those trickery compilations.  They really should, because it's just somebody trying to fucking pick your pocket.  That's it.  That's what they're doing.  They're fucking virtual pickpockets.  And they're not even good cover versions.  They're soulless, just going through the motions of the song, pieces of shit.  They're sitting there like, we have two hours of studio time to record a one-hour album. 
[00:36:30]  Yeah, go.  Hurry up, hurry up.  Go.  Yeah, and...  This is all profit.  We're just picking pockets.  I don't know.  I guess I should have looked a little closer.  Yeah, you should have.  Fire beware.  Caveat mTOR, as Mr. Brady said, as Greg went to buy a car.  You've got to know what you're purchasing.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  There was a pretty bunch of marathon on...  On what?  Like last week.  It was on one of those...  On what?  Yeah, I know.  What?  It was like one of those, like, antenna TV or one or... 
[00:37:00]  Like one of these goddamn things.  That's station Lady Dye watches?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Exactly.  And, oh my God, you just can't watch it without knowing that Mike is so gay.  Oh, the gayest.  So gay.  And then he's always trying to make time with Carol, but you see it in his face, he'll do  an eye roll, and you're like, oh, is that gay?  So you're thinking the character is also gay.  Yes!  I'm thinking Mike Brady, gay. 
[00:37:30]  Like, he couldn't stop the gayness.  I love that you're watching this like a documentary.  Like, no, it turns out he's gay, not that he's playing a character.  Exactly.  But it's all you think of when you see him.  Yes.  You can't not think of when he's hitting on Carol like, oh, stop it.  Right, right, right.  Stop it.  Yeah, yeah.  There was an episode where, I guess, Carol's old high school buddy, Tank, comes over.  Tank is like a football player.  Tank hankerous?  He was Tank hankerous.  That's what I was thinking.  But Tank comes over. 
[00:38:00]  There he goes.  And she's like, oh, Mike, you're not getting jealous of Tank.  And it was such a cuckold kind of experience, because Tank was alpha male in the shit out  of Mike.  And he was really an asshole.  He was a complete fucking dick.  But he, and Carol was just going for it.  What?  Like, oh, Tank.  Oh.  And it's like, oh, you're fucking totally, yeah, like, emasculating your husband. 
[00:38:30]  Well, then what happened was, I remember that one, is Mike laid under her.  Yes.  And Tank seeded Carol.  Seeded.  And Mr. Brady sucked out her honeypot.  Yeah.  Oh.  Honeypot.  Oh, is that disgusting.  Oh, Tank.  Yeah.  I always catch up on the old shows, you know.  A lot of good times.  So that's just some good times. 
[00:39:00]  Oh, is that Tank?  Called the quarterback sneak.  Oh.  What is that, the whole episode?  Yeah.  How did they do that?  It's on CBS.  Yeah.  CBS still plays.  CBS.com is playing Brady Bunch shit.  I guess they own the rights.  That's crazy.  This is, uh, Carol is expecting a visit from Tank Gates, her high school school.  Tank Gates.  Gates.  Tank's a dick, too.  Oh, okay.  And this is also, I think it's harder to forget that Mike Brady's a gay guy.  Yeah.  Later on, when he's got his hair grown out like that. 
[00:39:30]  Yeah, the, uh, the little afro thing.  Very curly.  Very gay afro.  Curly locks.  Look at him.  Oh.  He probably, you know, he did watch it.  He wanted to do dramatic roles.  Yeah.  He was a stage actor.  Stage actor.  And that would have got him, I think, a lot more gay ass.  Definitely.  Back in the day.  Yay!  Bobby's doing a bicycle!  Than having to say he's, you know, the father on the Brady Bunch.  He's a poor guy.  He had to take a kiss on the lips from his TV wife and just pee right after. 
[00:40:00]  Ew.  Didn't he, right after the Brady Bunch, like, got canceled, didn't he just go off and do,  like, a gay role and fucking...  Oh, yeah.  And then the fucking in Roots.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  He wanted to just be surrounded by black men, so he took the role.  He probably did it for free.  Yeah, I don't know what's happening.  That fucking Robert Reed's offering to pay for his own trailer and everything just to be here.  He thought the title was the slang for cocks.  A root.  He just thought there'd be dicks everywhere. 
[00:40:30]  I'm doing Roots.  Oh, now he's sitting there.  Here comes Tank.  Oh, got any more volume on this?  Yeah, Jesus.  Yeah.  Look at Tank.  Twinkles!  Call them Twinkles.  Oh, I'm Mike.  Well.  Right.  I'm Tank Gates.  Glad to meet you.  Well, thank you.  Tank's an asshole.  Tank Gates is a good head of hair.  Yeah, yeah.  That is what you'd think Tank Hankerous would look like, though, isn't it?  Yes!  Totally.  Where is my Twinkles?  Look at...  He's right here!  And what...  Twinkles! 
[00:41:00]  What a cunt!  What?  Yes!  She's standing there.  He jumps over the fucking couch and hugs her.  He's picking her up and shit.  He's just called Gorgeous?  You're as wild as ever.  And you're as pretty as ever.  No.  No, you're prettier.  And Mike's just there like...  Whatever, guys.  I don't think she didn't do too badly, either.  Oh.  That's so gay.  Look, he's got his arm around.  He's sitting on the couch together.  Look at Mike fluffing the sofa.  Yeah.  And guess who made All-American? 
[00:41:30]  Why don't you take a stab in the dark, honey?  Twinkles!  I don't think he's digging a tank.  No, he's not digging Carol.  He wants Carol to take a high.  He wants the fucking Mustang's hair.  Oh.  Or a tank eats his ass.  Tank would ravage Mike.  Yeah, he would.  Play ball, mate.  Mike.  Oh, I played some ball, not football.  Yes, in my mouth and in my anus.  Never on a field.  I played some ball, Westdale Tank.  Oh.  You have a son that old? 
[00:42:00]  Why, you look like you could be in high school yourself.  Did you hear that, Mike?  I don't know how old she is.  They went to high school together.  Me, still in high school?  Same age.  I heard it.  He's laughing.  I heard it.  Yeah.  He's being kind of a prick.  Yeah.  You say that because you haven't seen her pussy lips after three daughters tumbled out of it.  Look what I dug up, Tank.  Our old Westdale annual.  And all Tank does is point out pictures of himself. 
[00:42:30]  Tank's full of himself.  Spoiler.  Yeah.  I know.  Enough of that.  I was loving Tank.  Yeah, but it was so, it's like, no one does that.  Like, she's on the stairs.  Hi, Tank.  It's like, you fucking got a husband right there.  You're making him look like an asshole.  How would you feel if you lived, you or her, and you haven't had a good dicking in fucking ever,  and you live with a fucking Queen Mike Brady and Tank is showing up?  I'll bet you Tank was all girth.  Yes.  His cock was five inches long by eight inches wide.  That big, fat Tank cock. 
[00:43:00]  He used to have to apologize.  I'm sorry, Twinkles.  I normally don't like to fuck four times after I come.  Oh, it's all right.  She fucking, she crawled out of his fucking dorm room on her stomach.  Fucking legs broken.  Fucking Tank.  What happened at the end?  Well, she realized Tank is an asshole.  And he left.  And she was like, oh, yeah, I'm sorry, Mike.  You know, fucking.  Yeah.  She just realized he was jumping over the furniture.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[00:43:30]  He's running through.  Yeah, he's fucking idiot.  He stepped in tiger shit, and then he fucking put his feet on the couch.  He just wipes it on the fucking couch.  Like Tom Cruise on Oprah, except with dog shit on his shoes.  Yeah, yeah.  And then I was watching Good Times also.  And boy, the last, the last like season.  I thought it was Mississippi burning.  Good Times.  The last season of Good Times, I guess it must have been the last season.  Wow.  Just so bad. 
[00:44:00]  I don't even know what they were trying for.  They're doing shows.  Like Janet Jackson's in it, you know, because she's Penny.  Right.  In there.  And Bookman, the super, is on stage singing at some event.  Boy, they just ran out of shit.  Ran out of stuff to do.  Although it was funny because a couple of liberal parents came over because their white daughter wanted to live with Michael.  Michael Evans at a college, they were going to get a room together. 
[00:44:30]  And the parents came over and they were just happy because he was black.  Like they were pawning their white daughter off on the black sun.  And they were so like, it was every bleeding heart liberal thing.  It's like, I can't believe this is our first time in the ghetto.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was really bad.  Really bad.  But a show that started out kind of fun and stuff just ended up like, I didn't even know what it was anymore.  No Florida, no James.  Oh, Florida wasn't there either?  Yeah.  Even Florida would fucking, she stopped in for like one or two episodes. 
[00:45:00]  But I think she had had it by then.  Oh.  And it was always like, oh, Florida's on the phone calling.  Didn't it originally have some kind of like societal relevance?  Like it was actually saying something and then.  Yeah.  Yeah, they were trying to.  Towards the end, it was just another sitcom.  The Evans family never had a good break.  They never got a good, it was always some, something would fuck up.  The beginning of the episode, here it is, here's our chance, we're gonna make it baby and blah blah. 
[00:45:30]  And then by the end, it's like, oh, Whitey fucked us again.  Oh, Whitey got us again.  Oh, nerds.  Yes, the damn Whitey.  Fantastic.  I love those stupid old channels.  Well, our food's here.  Hey.  Why don't we, as they say, chow down.  Absolutely.  And, you know, we'll be back after these words.  Ain't no pussy when she's gone. 
[00:46:00]  It's my hand when she's away.  And when my dick don't get no service.  My dog gets really nervous.  Anytime.  It's my hand when she's over there.  Ain't no be hurt till she's back.  I wrap my dick in my Big Mac. 
[00:46:30]  I shared my burger with my boss.  He said he loved the secret sauce.  And I jerk, I jerk, I jerk, I jerk, I jerk.  I can't leave a little thing alone.  Ain't no pussy when she's gone again.  The O.P. and Anthony show continues. 
[00:47:00]  Continues.  Continues.  In moments.  In moments.  In moments.  In moments.  In moments.  The guys are back from the toilet.  And now, back to our show.  The O.P. and Anthony show.  Jimmy, hi everybody, we're back.  Jimmy's just, uh, going through his luggage and rambling. 
[00:47:30]  No, a cord, a fucking, uh.  What, power cord?  No, uh.  A USB?  Yeah.  To what?  Not a USB, a fucking fire wire.  A fire, fire wire?  Fire wire.  We gotta have one.  I don't think so.  Nothing uses fire wire.  What the wire do that you fucking fired him for?  Oh, yeah.  It's fucking, it's got on fire, um.  We don't have a fire wire cord here?  No.  There's gotta be.  No, nobody uses fire wire.  What do you use?  Fire wire.  USB.  Yeah. 
[00:48:00]  Well, USB is slower.  No, it's not.  Than fire wire?  Of course it is.  USB 2.0 is the same speed as fire wire.  Do you have a USB cord then?  That I could use in this.  I don't know.  You yell at me.  You should be able to use USB with that.  What is that?  A fucking.  USB, it's a fucking.  Yeah, but USB to what?  Can I pick it up?  Yeah, you could throw USB to USB in there.  USB 2, uh, Fire wire 800, either one of them, or ISATA.  Oh, ISATA.  What's ISATA? 
[00:48:30]  I see it on a lot of stuff, but I don't think I use it.  I don't know.  ISATA.  ISATA.  I have to transfer data now because, uh, you know, I'm pitching a talk show.  I want to do a talk show.  And, uh, I have fucking probably 50 interviews on this giant hard drive I'm bringing to L.A.  Yes.  And I want to have a real made up, just little teeny clips of moments from interviews we've  done.  Uh-huh.  Just so, if I, you know, if you're going to a fucking channel and you go, I want to do  this, you know, it's obviously in the context of our show, but it's still, these are people 
[00:49:00]  we've talked to, whatever.  Yeah.  It shows that you're not fucking going, ah, ah, in front of us.  Hey, where do you want, yeah, yeah, yeah.  See, at least they want, you want them to know that you've interviewed real people.  Yeah.  So, a lot of the interviews I have, and Sam gave me two of the, two of these cards I'm  going to transfer before I leave, but most of our amazing, big interviews, Donald Sutherland,  James Cromwell, fucking, uh, you know, so many, Shaq, uh, fucking, so many of these  interviews we don't have, uh, the woman who films for us, the professional camera person 
[00:49:30]  has, and I have to know where these are.  I'll never get them today, but I have to have them soon.  I don't know where they are.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Where are they?  We have no control over our own content on this fucking show.  I hope Tim can fucking whip this fucking shit house.  Oh, man.  We don't own it.  But not that we should, I understand we don't own the video part, but for us not to even  be able to go to it.  Yeah, to use it.  Like, to put it on a website or something, it's fucking awful.  Well, I don't, I don't think that's, that's the case.  I mean, we haven't asked. 
[00:50:00]  This is the first time we're asked.  We shouldn't have to go ask for it.  We should have, uh, uh, access to it.  Access to it.  We should have it as well as they have it and go, okay, we want to do this with  it a bit, right?  Well, we know we do.  We've just never asked.  Yeah, we don't have a website.  We shouldn't have to ask.  That's what I'm saying.  Yeah.  That should be up somewhere that we have, like, a password for and stuff, and we should  be able to access it at any time.  Or a hard drive on some of these back computers.  Oh, and or a hard drive!  I gotta get this thing off there.  Not we gotta go and ask for, it's like, we just let our content go everywhere.  Yes.  And I have no fucking idea what's happening with it.  What are we doing? 
[00:50:30]  Exactly.  You make a great point right there.  We should have access to it.  I'm not saying they won't give it to us.  I'm not saying that they'll refuse us.  Oh, I am.  I bet they don't.  What do you want to use it for?  What?  You want to use it to get a gig?  Well, then we want 50% of the proceeds from said gig.  There's enough on here to be very...  I'm gonna have somebody just make a quick reel.  I can't do that.  These people are doing that shit.  I don't know how to do it.  Yeah, make a sizzle reel.  Yeah, or whatever.  Make it look good.  But there's so many interviews, it won't be... 
[00:51:00]  Starwipe.  You gotta use Starwipe.  Starwipe, yeah.  I like the Star Wars transitions.  Yeah, they just kind of fold out from the middle.  What's fun is, and this is...  You have to know a little bit about movie editing to pull it off, but you can start with actually  the Star Wars titles, and it can go doo-doo, and then they're scrolling up, and it goes...  Could you imagine?  A long, long time ago in a galaxy far away, comedian Jim Norton wanted to do a talk show.  Could you imagine how embarrassing that is? 
[00:51:30]  But that's why I should do it.  Make it as cheesy as you can.  Oh, God.  Make it look like an old 80s wedding video with fucking tracking problems and everything.  Episode four.  Jim Norton's hope that you want to put this talk show on the air.  That's a good one.  I just don't know if they would understand what I was doing and not know that I'm not  a cunt.  Jim, Jim, don't do it.  That would be great, but I mean, I will be there when I give him the disc.  Like, this is...  Yeah, yeah.  So you can sit there after they watch it and go, you guys know I was kidding, right? 
[00:52:00]  Yeah, you just don't joke at it when they don't laugh at all.  Yeah, that's...  You just see them sitting there, like, looking at each other.  They don't get the joke.  They go, so is this the type of humor you would want to do on the show?  Yeah, yeah.  Star Wars.  Oh, no.  We're looking for talent.  How is our pal Scorch doing?  In search of a gig still?  Yeah, he's on the job hunt, updating his Facebook.  God damn.  To have to fucking, like, at this point in your career... 
[00:52:30]  I know.  To have to fucking be...  He's gonna know some tapes.  He's gonna be 50 in, like, a week.  Oh, my God.  Happy birthday.  Yeah, right?  You're fired.  Yeah, Jesus.  What did he get, um...  What did he get the boot for?  Was it just a change of format?  It's not even a change of format that I know of.  The station is still the station, and he didn't do anything, obviously.  Oh, yeah, it wasn't controversy or anything, right?  Yeah, no, I think it was a hamburger pizza, we're gonna pay the board op to do afternoon 
[00:53:00]  situation.  Why are you laughing, Travis?  Yes, Travis, are you going through his, uh...  He's, yeah, I'm going on his Facebook.  Yeah.  He's not even on the air.  No.  Oh, no.  So, here's a post from yesterday.  Okay.  Uh, now that it's that time again, what was your favorite school lunch?  Oh, oh.  He's doing call bits on his Facebook?  He's still trying to keep it going.  But you gotta keep your, uh, your audience entertained so they're there when you get 
[00:53:30]  back on the air.  He figured that he'll keep the Facebook live, and that way he'll be able to tell people.  Yeah.  Oh, look at...  I mean, he's back on the independent wrestling circuit.  Yep.  Well, that's good.  What is it?  New England Championship Wrestling.  Oh, God.  Tito Santana and Tony Atlas are going to be there.  NECW?  NECW, that's right.  Special appearance by former Rock 101 personality.  Yeah, can you add former to the flyer?  Yeah, yeah, you're going to have to... 
[00:54:00]  I want to deflect any lawsuits.  Did you print those flyers yet?  Yeah.  Stop the presses.  Stop the presses on the flyers.  Oh, poor Scorch.  Tito Santana, huh?  Yeah.  New England Championship Wrestling.  Boy, man, that is just...  Tony Atlas.  What a shit fucking gig.  I'm sorry.  That's a shit fucking gig.  I know that's the gig.  Like, that's not just a fun thing.  That's horrible. 
[00:54:30]  That's ramen for that night.  Yeah.  That's your ramen noodles.  You know, wrestling really is just a...  It's thankless.  Oh, yeah.  If you're not on top, you are just fucking...  On the bottom.  On the bottom.  There's the top and there's the bottom.  Yeah.  And there's no middle class of wrestling.  Mm-mm.  There's the elite wealthy and the fucking poor projects.  John Cena's got a waterfall in his house.  Right.  Right.  And Tony Atlas is... 
[00:55:00]  Tony Atlas is...  ...hoping they'll give him $250 for this.  Is with Scorch.  With Scorch.  Co-headlining.  Former.  Former Rock 105.  Rock 5.  Rock 101.  Whatever it is.  Personality.  You'd think they could find something for him.  You'd think they'd be like, we're going to give you a job in sales.  We're going to do something.  Just to keep a paycheck coming in.  To take care of your own.  You don't even have to worry that they're going to be there forever.  Because they're probably not, you know...  Like, if you hire one of these old wrestlers...  What, you've got to pay him five years?  Before he's fucking gone? 
[00:55:30]  Yeah.  You should give him enough to feed the habit.  Right, right.  Yeah.  Enough to feed that habit.  Let him do himself it.  Is John Cena banging one of the Bella Twins?  Yeah.  Is that what it is?  Somebody commenting here.  I know nothing of what's going on these days.  But I did see the Bella Twins on some show.  The reality show?  Yeah.  No, it wasn't even that.  They were guests on something.  Oh, okay.  Maybe Ridiculousness or something.  Yeah, I think they were probably promoing their reality show.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  What do they do on the reality show? 
[00:56:00]  The WWE has an E...  Like a real reality show on E.  Oh, no.  For the Divas.  It comes on after the Kardashians.  Of course it does.  It's like a legit thing.  I...  And believe me, this isn't an age thing.  I just don't get these fucking, like, those reality shows.  Kardashians and fucking...  I could sink my teeth into some reality.  Mm-hmm.  Reality?  You want reality?  But the Kardashian thing, and you just get two fucking wrestling chicks and fucking throw them... 
[00:56:30]  There's nothing I want to hear there.  Nothing.  People love the drama, even if it's...  It's completely fake, produced, written drama.  It's terrible drama.  Why?  The drama in your life doesn't come to an all's well that ends well conclusion after an hour?  Paul, no.  Oh.  No, it doesn't.  Hmm.  My drama, it's real. 
[00:57:00]  Sometimes it just fizzles out.  Hopefully.  Sometimes it rears its ugly head months later.  Sometimes you think it's fizzled out because you've ignored it.  Right.  What you don't know is it's just ammoing up.  And there it is.  Staring you in the face.  Yeah.  Sleeping dragon.  Scorch.  Oh, more Scorch?  Why?  Sent a package out to one of the satellite networks.  There's only one.  That's all there is.  There's just the one satellite network. 
[00:57:30]  He also sent a package off to a New York station.  Ooh.  Which?  There's no rock station in New York.  Where could he possibly be Scorch in New York?  He couldn't.  There's a lot of begging and desperation on this Facebook page.  Oh.  Scorch.  It's only been nine days.  Oh, nine days.  That seems like a long time when you're off the air.  Why wouldn't they give him a job here?  Right?  Well, yeah.  He posted, anyone going out and about in Manchester tonight, where are you going to be?  I might want to go out and hang for a bit. 
[00:58:00]  Oh.  No.  Have to conserve my cash, but I need to see people.  Oh.  Someone buy me drinks.  Oh, no.  Oh.  That's a shame.  Yeah.  One of the satellite companies.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hubble.  Yeah.  Telstar.  One of the...  I just listened to the air check that I'm sending out to stations.  I hate to sound like an arrogant douche, but great stuff.  I'm proud to be at the top of my game.  Oh.  They could give him, like, a Denny job here or something. 
[00:58:30]  They really should.  Hire Scorch.  Think of the morale of this place if Scorch was walking the halls.  Oh, you fucking imagine it.  Scorch walking the halls?  Especially if he didn't have an air shift, but he was acting like he did.  He's got to, like, just do, like, a Denny thing.  Right.  No air shift.  And then every so often, we're like, where's...  No, get Scorch in here.  Get Scorch in here.  I'm like, hey, Scorch.  Hey, how you doing, guys?  And then we talk to Scorch.  Do you think he would, like, go from office to office doing the Brainstyle Simulator? 
[00:59:00]  Oh, yeah.  Or Simulator?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  You guys ready?  No dirty stuff.  50% of American people are like this in their bedroom.  I'll be back in 20 minutes.  He grabs the door jam and swings around it, like, hey, guys.  Like, as he looks in the office.  Knock, knock.  Knock, knock.  I got a question for you.  No, nothing dirty.  No dirty stuff.  Did he really write, um, I'm at the top of my game?  Yeah, right here.  He is at the top of his game.  I'm proud to still be at the top of my game. 
[00:59:30]  Unemployed due to the quotation marks, times.  But still, at the top of my game.  I left with a great ratings.  He wrote ratings in big capital letters.  Oh.  I left with great ratings and a great and loyal bunch of listeners.  And, oh, yeah.  He likes caps.  He likes a lot of capitals in weird places.  My New Hampshire Association of Broadcasters, quote, unquote, personality of the year awards.  Somewhere, someone, somewhere, will scoop me up soon, and I'll do it there. 
[01:00:00]  Why is he crowing like that?  How long ago was it when you guys worked with Scorch?  It was 19 and 96.  96.  And he was in Boston.  So he went from Boston.  Yeah.  And then he did, like, I guess six or seven years in Syracuse.  Yeah.  And then he's been in Manchester for a few years.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You think we could at least get him, like, a meeting up here? 
[01:00:30]  Where he has earned at least a meeting.  Yeah.  He's been in radio forever.  With somebody.  Who would he meet with?  Gary?  Travis?  I'd give him a job in a second.  I'm in finance now, so I can't really help you.  What do you know about finance?  Yeah, I know a lot about finance.  I'm good with numbers.  I don't have any.  Yeah.  And I'm really good with numbers.  For instance, and no dirty stuff, 47% of Americans, I know dirty stuff. 
[01:01:00]  Oh, that poor fuck.  What about his show, though?  That was huge.  Why didn't he just constantly see his show?  Yeah, what about PFG TV?  Oh, that might be a good host.  Is he still doing it?  It's on hold.  Maybe it's on just a hiatus.  Maybe it's in between seasons.  Well, who was paying for it?  You know, he had his sponsors, but...  Whoever watched it.  Yeah, that's...  Oh, God, poor fucking Scorch, man.  I feel bad. 
[01:01:30]  He was in New York.  Oh, good.  He could really make something of himself with all the opportunities that this city has.  Oh, yeah.  I'll say one thing.  Scorch fucking at least keeps busy and tries to do stuff.  Yeah.  I respect that.  Look at him.  He never stops hustling.  He's a hustler, man.  He's not a fucking lazy.  He's out there.  He's out there.  Well, there are a lot of posts about being home in time to watch certain TV shows.  Oh, really?  I don't know how...  He's got to watch them for his show.  That's work.  Flintstones at one o'clock.  Oh.  Hey, Flintstones are on at one.  Yabba dabba doo. 
[01:02:00]  And he did.  He did in Syracuse constantly mention how much he likes watching reruns of The Fresh Prince  of Bel-Air.  Oh, God.  That's going to get you nowhere.  Come on.  But then I encouraged him and talked about how great Fresh Prince was.  So, we used to do breaks about Fresh Prince while his co-host went fucking crazy.  Why did his co-host hate it?  Because he didn't think that doing breaks about Fresh Prince three mornings out of the  week on morning radio was worthwhile. 
[01:02:30]  Yeah.  No.  I did.  It's a good show.  Well, you were, what, the intern?  Yeah.  Matter?  20 years old.  Yeah.  Whatever.  Would you ever encourage Scorch to talk about things that his co-host hated?  Oh.  Constantly.  What a troublemaker.  You think you fucking brought Scorch down?  No.  I got it.  Because he went from Syracuse to Manch Vegas.  Like, he moved up.  That's an up move?  He didn't get fired from Syracuse.  Oh, okay.  You don't leave Syracuse and go somewhere else. 
[01:03:00]  Right, right.  You know?  He left Pauly in the lurch, so.  God damn it.  Can they just fucking...  Ah, sorry.  No.  I just saw a racial event happening on television.  That won't be covered as such.  Yeah, of course not.  Oh, gosh.  All right.  Are we done with Scorch?  Poor Scorch.  And then we can get into some of the...  It's depressing to read this.  Is it?  He posts like a dozen times a day.  He's got free time.  He's got a lot of spare time.  He's smart, though, because at least he's trying to hold on to the audience that he has by 
[01:03:30]  keeping his Facebook and keeping present.  Yeah, I think this is therapeutic because there's a lot of overly positive reinforcement  going on.  And yeah, it's staying in his public eye.  Uh-huh.  Keeping his audience aware of what's going on in the world of Scorch.  He's...  I'm still out there, people.  Still out there.  Yeah.  Good for him.  Well, we wish you luck, Scorch.  And maybe we'll see him when he's here. 
[01:04:00]  I mean, he sent off a package to one of the satellite networks.  Maybe it was ours.  Could have been DirecTV.  Or Dish.  Or Dish.  Oh, it could be one of those.  Right, right.  Maybe it's just a pitch for PFG.  Yeah, okay.  That's going to happen.  Good job, Jim.  You got a little competition in the talk show world.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, I mean, if Scorch tries to get a talk show, it's over for Jim.  That's where PFG TV is.  You already got one.  That's why I'm putting a reel together.  Can I get guys like this now looking?  I guess it's a Marine who was beaten. 
[01:04:30]  A white Marine beaten up by three black teenagers.  But he was defending a black girl for some reason.  Some black teenager.  Was he?  Is that a girl?  I don't know.  I can't tell what the braids.  I don't know.  But he was defending a teen, I guess.  He might have jumped into a fight that was happening.  Really?  Yeah.  That whole three-on-one, four-on-one fucking gangs.  I know.  God damn.  How about a fair fight?  Well.  There's a lot of blindsiding going on.  Oh, wow.  He got the shit beat out of him.  Ooh, look at his eyeball. 
[01:05:00]  My goodness.  There have been a few black-on-white assaults of late that you won't really hear about.  Yeah.  But, you know, I'm not going to fucking go off on it.  If you want to hear about it, read my Twitter.  I'll just, yeah.  Read my angry Twitter.  Google this.  Google when you get home Jeffrey Babbitt.  The 62-year-old white guy who was beaten by a black guy beating.  He's yelling, I hate white people.  Yes.  And he's attacked and he's in a coma.  And look, I don't, I'm not saying that, oh my God, these fucking terrible people beat 
[01:05:30]  this.  It happens.  People beat the shit out of each other.  It stinks.  It's just the press that won't cover it.  So just Google that.  Yeah.  And you think we're paranoid and crazy and a bunch of white guys crying.  Just Google it.  That's all.  Uh-huh.  Yeah, but especially because the guy said, I'm going to beat up the next white person  I see.  Yeah, they just don't.  Yeah.  Like, why is...  If that was reversed.  Well, yeah.  If it was some white guy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The press would cover it accurately.  And the front page of the fucking post, it's RFK's secret slam.  This is why I fucking hate Americans. 
[01:06:00]  Robert Kennedy Jr.'s diary is news.  It's his business.  What Robert Kennedy Jr. wrote in his fucking diary is his business.  Ooh, but he's a Kennedy.  Do dish.  Well, the fact that Kennedy is fucking somebody on the side is not exactly front page news.  Kennedy holds wife's hand and turns down pussy.  That will be front page news.  But we feel entitled to it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So all you fucking people who bellyache about the NSA, this is why I love the NSA, and I  hope they keep fucking spying on you, because this is what we bring on ourselves. 
[01:06:30]  That's who we are.  Just a nosy, nosy bunch of cunts who can't stop looking into each other's fucking private  business.  Yeah.  If this wouldn't sell, they would never print it.  If people looked at this and went, that's gross.  I'm not buying that.  Yeah, people are very quick to jump on the NSA and everything about their rights and privacy,  which they should be.  Absolutely.  But you can't then, you know, pick the paper up and paw through, ooh, what did he do?  Oh, that's terrible.  Yeah.  None of your fucking business.  No, we can't get enough of it, though. 
[01:07:00]  Can't get enough of somebody else's private life.  Yeah.  But everyone out there thinks that your private life is so sacred, and what about privacy?  He who gives up privacy for security deserves neither liberty or liberty or...  Keep up with your fucking Ben Franklin quotes, dummies.  I love when people have the quotes.  But I mean, it's like, but there's no consistency.  No.  None whatsoever.  We don't give a shit about anybody's stuff but our own.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, he, um... 
[01:07:30]  He can't spell.  He spelled buffoon wrong.  I saw that.  Well, Reverend Al is a buffoon.  Is a buffoon.  Yeah.  Um, and Jesse Jackson, I guess, a media addict.  Yeah.  There's nothing wrong with that.  That's not exactly insightful stuff, either.  Yeah, yeah.  It's kind of, you know, obvious.  Robert Kennedy Jr. is a bore.  That's what we learned.  Was there anything, um, anything, uh, any scandal in there?  No, he's just fucking women behind his wife's back and... 
[01:08:00]  Oh, okay.  ...marking them off with a, uh, whatever, but...  Who cares?  Yeah.  Who cares?  Let's see how many fucking, how many guys out there are going to own up to cheating.  I've cheated.  Oh, Jesus, Jim.  How many of you guys in the fucking press that...  Now, it's funny how, you know, the New York Post, um, who's owned by, uh, News Corp, which  is run by Rupert Murdoch, they don't seem to be talking about his divorce a lot on the  fucking front page.  Do you think that would be good for the reporter?  No.  To do a story about that? 
[01:08:30]  But I mean, I don't even care about Murdoch's divorce, but you know what I mean?  Like, I don't give a shit what goes on with him and his wife.  But it's like, it's funny how they don't seem to be covering that one too much.  No, no.  That reporter would be so gone so fast.  But you know what?  There, there shouldn't be that, um, that power in, in the media where somebody has the power  to tell somebody, you know, you can't do that because I run this, uh, paper or, or  news organization, you know?  But that's what we're at.  That's where we're at right now anyway.  Yeah. 
[01:09:00]  We're in such a fucked place with this stupid fake news.  I, you know, I get my Twitter battles and stuff and I like, uh, I like quoting, um, fact.  Uh, and, and I give my own opinion out there, but it's presented as opinion.  And then when it's, uh, it's factual information, I, I back it up with a source and whatnot.  But some people just hear stuff on the news and, and, and they get that wrong, but then  they print it as, as fact.  And there's no arguing with them after that.  You can't, uh, you can't sway them. 
[01:09:30]  Oh, God.  And now there's another story about how the NSA can access most smartphone data.  Yeah.  Good.  Enjoy.  You like that?  Sure.  Why?  That's who we are.  I know.  We are nosy bodies.  That's who we are.  The NSA, they're not magic men from fucking planet magic, man.  They're fucking us.  Every guy in the NSA goes home and has to deal with a cranky, cunty wife and takes a shit  just like you and me.  They're not, they're not from another planet.  Yeah. 
[01:10:00]  They're guys that you went to fucking school with and they're guys that you see on the  golf course.  Mm-hmm.  That's what you deserve.  We really, uh, we really have gotten to the point where we're, we're pretty comfortable  with, with giving, um, with putting our personal information on devices that we really don't  understand.  Yeah.  I mean, everyone's got a basic understanding of their phones and how it works and, and,  uh, networks and Wi-Fi and whatnot.  But you don't really have an understanding of where that goes. 
[01:10:30]  You, you assume it's secure because we've been told it's secure, but, uh, you know,  and everything you have is on your phone.  Everything you fucking have.  You used to not put in your address when you was on the internet ever.  Like, the first big hurdle Amazon had was nobody wanted to do internet shopping because  you'd have to put your address in.  And credit card information too.  It's almost scary.  Now, like your, all your routing numbers and everything are just on your phone.  Everything's right there. 
[01:11:00]  You got your fucking, like, like fucking PayPal is right there.  Yeah, just stay logged in because I don't want to have to.  And your bank, like, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Like, like your fucking bank apps.  You, you could access your bank accounts and pay bills and stuff.  It's all right there on your phone.  And who's to say who's accessing it at any moment?  They're pretty good.  I think we've kind of resigned ourselves to it.  Like, fuck it.  They can just backdoor it anyway.  Like, if it's not on my phone, they can get it.  But the companies, credit card companies, are pretty good with refunding stolen shit too.  I had a stop payment recently because I was, I bought some clothes in LA and they had to order it from New York. 
[01:11:30]  But they, they ordered something from New York and Chicago together.  So my credit card.  Oh my.  Saw that.  And then, you know, they put a security stopper.  Was it theft?  No.  Was someone trying to thieve it or was it a.  No.  No, it was a legitimate order.  I was ordering two, two pairs of pants on a tie or some dumb shit.  Look at you shopping all over the country.  Well, you know me.  That's why they call me Zip Around Town Norton.  That's my nickname.  I've never heard that.  Yeah, yeah.  It's a new nickname.  I've been trying to get the catch on.  But then they fucking immediately put a flag on it. 
[01:12:00]  Yeah, yeah.  I like the, uh, the, the pay with the phone thing too.  Yeah.  Pop up and just bleep.  I haven't done that.  And pay for shit.  Yeah, it's pretty goddamn cool.  I guess Dunkin' Donuts has it.  That's what they've been advertising now.  Starbucks, though.  Where you could like fucking, yeah.  And you just like, takes it out of your account.  You just fucking, moneyless, the moneyless, the cashless society that you heard about many years ago.  They're like, well, you know, one of these days, there's not even going to be cash. 
[01:12:30]  You're just going to, you know, be able to, and most people thought it would be like credit cards.  You know, swipe and shit like that.  But no, it's like this weird fucking thing.  You're just holding up a device to the cash register.  How does it work then?  Does it work by app?  Do you have to put money into it?  I guess you could probably link it to your bank account or link it to a PayPal account.  I know PayPal.  Or a credit card.  PayPal updated their app where they now have like a list of stores.  And you can see what stores are in your area where you can buy stuff on your phone, pay for it on your phone, and then just go pick it up. 
[01:13:00]  I think what the Apple store does.  Just walk out the fucking door with it.  You just grab it and go, hey, I paid for this.  Yeah, you could do that at the Apple store.  The Barclays Center, they have their own app where you enter all of your information, you can order everything that you want, and then they have a separate line, and you just pick up everything.  Like order what?  What could you order from the Barclays Center?  You can order food, beer, everything.  It shows you all the food concession stands located near your seats. 
[01:13:30]  You choose what you want.  You pay for it on your phone.  And then you'll-  Give you a number or something, like number 140?  Yeah, and then you just go right to the counter, and you just pick it up.  It's so weird doing the Apple store thing, where you pay for it, and then you just go and pick it up at the store, because you don't pick it up at a desk.  You just take it off the shelf.  Yeah.  It's like I bought a hard drive, and I just walked in, and I just took it off the shelf, and I was like, I guess I'll just leave with this now. 
[01:14:00]  What?  And then you just leave.  No way.  Yes, that's how it works.  You don't have to show anybody?  No.  No.  I don't know how they know.  Well, Sam, let's be honest.  You're a white man.  Allegedly.  You pick it up, and you scan the barcode or whatever with your phone.  Oh, okay.  You scan the barcode with your phone.  Oh, so it deactivates it.  But nobody has to see you.  No, no.  But you walk you through.  You just go in and you do it yourself.  Yeah.  Yeah, but the fact that you do have to scan it means it probably demagnetized it, or it takes it out of their system. 
[01:14:30]  Yeah, I mean, it takes it out of its system, but there's no demagnetizing on it.  No, no.  No, I mean, I'm trying to figure it out.  Not demagnetizing.  It's just, but it's a simple, at the same time, nobody was watching me, so I could have been like...  The security knows that the barcode's been scanned.  That's what I'm saying, yeah.  Yeah, I mean, they would have confirmed that I was not stealing it, but still, it looked and felt like...  It's just very weird.  I was stealing it, yeah.  Do you think, like, when you go to the, like, even to CVS now, when you pay for your own... 
[01:15:00]  And I like it better.  It's fucking, you know, boop, boop, drop, go!  The less you gotta deal with people, the better.  Except when you get, like, somebody that should not be doing that in front of you.  Right?  I never do it at the supermarket.  I always do it.  I always do it there.  Always.  Never, because I always feel like...  Because I hate it when people don't know how to work it, so I don't ever...  Yeah, but I know I know how to work it.  I don't ever want to be in that position.  See, just get someone to help you.  There's always someone there.  They always have what they call retard prevention.  One of the persons just kind of waiting.  But boy, those old people who don't know how to work it. 
[01:15:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, they don't understand the technology.  What am I doing here?  I don't understand.  And they're mucking up the works.  Just mucking up the works.  What was that guy's name?  Who was mucking up the works?  The detective?  Oh, God.  That's from the detective.  That was his big thing.  You're mucking up the works.  Mucking up the works.  Yes, yes.  Ah!  Somebody out there might... 
[01:16:00]  Yeah, yeah, someone might remember.  I can't fucking remember that.  It was a detective story I was trying to push.  Yes.  You were trying to push a detective.  Where his whole thing, his new character, was you were mucking up the works.  Yes, that was his catchphrase.  The damn sergeant.  I couldn't get along with the sergeant.  Your catchphrase.  Oh, mongoose?  Oh, yeah, mongoose.  The thing was, your goose is...  Your goose is cooked, I guess.  Your goose is cooked.  Yeah.  Your goose is cooked.  What was his real name?  You know, mucking up the works.  Mongoose meant something.  Mongoose?  That was his nickname. 
[01:16:30]  Yes, yes.  His real name was something else.  The goose?  No.  I don't remember.  Walt Mongoose Jenkins.  Oh, yeah, Walt Jenkins.  He's a no-nonsense cock on the beat.  Walt Jenkins.  He bends the rules and always gets his man.  Criminals, beware.  If you're caught mucking up the works, the mongoose is out for you.  Criminals don't muck up the works.  Yeah, it was like a mongoose in a snake pit or some dumb shit.  You didn't like this good?  That's terrible.  I love your horrible shows.  Yeah, Walt Jenkins.  Well, yeah, it's pretty fucking amazing, man, with the scanning everything. 
[01:17:00]  Yeah, yeah.  When you do it at the supermarket, they know the weight of things, and you've got to leave  it in the bag.  I always end up like, okay, this bag is packed, and they go, no.  And I go, no.  Oh, now everybody behind me is looking at me like I'm a fucking idiot, and like...  You are.  Everyone in front of you right now is looking at you like that.  Because you've got to put it on the scale thingy?  You've got to leave it on the scale the whole time.  The whole time?  I like going to the cash register.  You have to...  The bags are... 
[01:17:30]  They have, like, scales underneath them.  Yeah.  So it knows that you have put the item in the bag.  You could put skip bagging, can't you?  You always have to put it on the scale.  I think there's a way around that.  At the supermarket, I think you have to.  Yeah, you have to at least put it on the counter.  Like, sometimes I'll bring my own bags, and I just put it on the counter, and then I bag it later.  Stores will eventually, like the Apple store, have no...  They might have an employee to help with glitches, but eventually you'll just walk in, and it will just be like a pure...  Like the future, it'll just be pristine, the merchandise, and you'll just get it, boop, and walk out. 
[01:18:00]  There won't be any more lines or...  I hope so.  It's great.  Yeah, I think it's great, too.  I saw a show on the fact that a lot of people are losing jobs to robots.  Yeah.  Robotic automation, things like that.  Parking attendants.  Yes.  Yeah.  They showed this warehouse that had these little flat, little wheeled robots, and it would go underneath these racks, lift up the rack, and take it to the people where they would choose what they needed to pack in these boxes, and then it would take the rack back away. 
[01:18:30]  And it replaces people who would be, like, getting in the way, and these little things can go under everything, so...  But even though that's where we should go, like, what happens to all those jobs?  Yeah, well, they go to the robot.  So we just decrease the population?  But someone's got to build the robots.  No, we just increase unemployment.  But wouldn't people eventually have to starve to death?  Yeah.  There's no jobs for them. 
[01:19:00]  It's a gradual change.  It is a gradual change.  It's not like they're going to go, oh, we'll just get factory jobs instead.  No, there's none of those either.  Can't have that.  But there's the robot building place.  Yeah, just build robots.  And they do it better than people will, though.  Oh, man, but then the robots will build the robots.  Yeah, there's going to be, like, ten geniuses that build robots that build robots, and those will be the ten jobs.  Right, that's it.  Everybody else is fucked.  Yeah.  What kind of jobs can people do, the robots?  Well, there's something to going to the supermarket, back to the supermarket. 
[01:19:30]  And telling the lady, no, those are four apples.  I need to know the price of them, and the lady will tell you.  Yeah, exactly.  So you have some fucking potential, some future robbing victim, which is what she is, or a robot will tell you, those are pears.  I don't want to talk to a robot.  Robots, like, there's no...  Those are pears.  I hate when I have to interact with humans at a store.  I like interacting with people.  Like when they go, oh, can I help you with something? 
[01:20:00]  Oh.  Called douche and bag.  That's an awful idea.  When I have to...  When someone asks me, like, hey, can I help you?  Do you need help with anything?  Even if I need help, I always say no.  Because I don't...  It's like, look, this isn't fucking brain surgery.  I could figure this out myself.  I could go in here.  Oh, I'm looking for a certain item. 
[01:20:30]  I'll fucking look for it.  I like going to the Apple store, though, and being like, hey, genius.  What's your favorite hard drive?  Oh, first of all, how do you get to anybody?  They're always busy.  Exactly.  I hate waiting for their shit.  You gotta wait.  They pass by, and you go, oh, could you help me?  Oh, no, I'm doing this.  I'm sure if you go to the Windows store, you'll be able to...  There's plenty of people there.  Lots of free time.  I don't need five people to help me, so you don't have to carry me while he gets my stuff.  The Windows store.  I fucking love...  I mean, you're going to a popular place. 
[01:21:00]  Yeah.  It's just brilliant.  I got that hard drive yesterday.  I went on about a four terabyte, or eight terabyte hard drive.  Eight terabytes.  Yeah, just for home.  That's great.  That's not it.  Stop looking at it.  That's two terabytes.  I'm looking at it.  I see you're fucking greedily eyeing up my two terabyte drive, hoping it's an eight  terabiter.  But it's a terabyte.  You walk right in, it's fucking just wonderful.  Oh, yeah, I actually just did go up to the register and pay for it, though, so I'm really  adding nothing here.  Yeah, but I'm right.  You're talking about the old way of doing it.  But at stores like the Apple store and the Disney store, they've got people just walking 
[01:21:30]  around with those phones that swipe the credit.  Oh, yeah, that's okay.  Are you done?  I can take you right here.  I'm for less cash registers, but certainly more people.  I like people with handheld cash registers.  That's fun.  I don't mind if they're there.  It's a blast.  Handheld cocks is fun.  Handheld tits.  I don't mind if they're there to ring you up and shit like that.  Right.  I don't like the interaction.  I don't like like if I walk into a Best Buy or something, I want to buy some TV or whatever  the fuck I don't need them to tell me what the TV has or does. 
[01:22:00]  It's written right the fuck there.  I never understood that.  I'm trying to just get somebody to go, look, I want that.  I'm buying it.  Just get it for me.  But you also have to know like where you are.  If you go to Best Buy and you have a question about something, they're not going to know.  No, they're morons.  But you get the idiots that go there, though, and they're like, is this 3D?  And you know what they do?  Look at the fucking box.  The guy that you're asking looks at the exact same thing that you can read.  That's just it.  There's no reason to ask them anything at Best Buy. 
[01:22:30]  It's not like you're going to be an H.  I will go to Best Buy, though, and be like, tell me the difference between these two TVs.  Sam, do that.  No, I hate that.  I like them to tell me.  What's the difference between these two TVs?  Well, this one's older and more passable.  This one began dressing in a certain...  Oh, jeez.  Of course.  I'm asked the questions guy, though.  I like a good question.  I have no fucking time for that.  No time for that.  Right.  You get a second opinion.  It's always nice.  No. 
[01:23:00]  No, because who the fuck is...  Who are they to tell you anything?  They know more than I do.  No, they see the TVs every day.  Yeah, they're talking about them all day.  It's all they talk about is TV, TV, TV.  But you could go online.  You do all your research online.  You do all the research online.  Yeah, me neither.  I don't like...  Oh, you read the reviews.  You're all assholes who read reviews.  Ew.  What, are you going to Yelp, you queer?  I'm busy.  Every now and then, you go to Best Buy, you find some guy in the camera section who's, like,  been working at Best Buy for, like, nine years.  That's great.  Fucking loves cameras.  Yeah.  You go, tell me the difference between these two. 
[01:23:30]  Really.  And then he gives you...  And then he pulls you in the back and he gives you a good mouthfuck.  Why would you do that?  I just thought it was really funny that you, like, tell the difference.  He's like, come here, I'll tell you.  Yeah, come here, I'll tell you.  Yeah.  Takes you in the back room.  Fucking hits you over the head while you're still groggy.  Yeah.  Fucking sodomizing you.  He brutally rapes you while he's holding your afro and he's pushing your face in that  fucking mop water.  Robot's not going to do that. 
[01:24:00]  I love the idea of everything being robotic.  And I like going to a cash register and saying, hey, you rang that up wrong.  And they're like, oh, so I did.  Beep, beep, beep.  But a robot wouldn't.  A robot wouldn't.  Yes, the robots make mistakes.  No, a robot knows all the fucking, the right prices for that week.  The sales, the this.  It's all factored in.  At a cash register going, where's the person to help me?  The robot has done me wrong.  Oh.  And there'd be nobody.  And I'd just be standing there unwilling to say, okay, because I'm not going to pay 
[01:24:30]  the extra five bucks.  Well, then you don't.  You start over.  What?  You move to another one and go, beep, beep, beep, beep.  Say, fuck that robot.  No, I need somebody to tell me.  Oh, God.  You are a needy person.  You got to talk to a human being.  No.  Human beings are dummies.  They go, you know, welcome to Best Buy.  How are you?  And I go, I'm great.  And you know what I always say?  How are you doing?  You.  And they're always very happy.  You're not happy.  You can't be this guy.  Yeah.  No one that works at Best Buy is happy.  No.  Well, they're happy I asked that question. 
[01:25:00]  No, you don't mean it.  No, but they're at least.  Who cares the fuck how they are?  They're at least happy that somebody is like, you know.  Do they ever look at their name tag and point at it as an answer?  How do you think I am?  Shit face.  Yeah, look.  Look where I work.  I'm here on Saturday.  No.  Or see, you say thank you after they ring you.  Thanks.  Yeah.  I don't.  And they like that.  I yell, gimme, and I snatch it.  Gimme.  I always slow down at the exit when I'm leaving with the bag and stuff so it shows that I  didn't steal anything.  I'm not running out of the place.  You look suspicious. 
[01:25:30]  So I might stop and check my pocket and look in the bag and then walk out.  Because it's like, oh, he wouldn't do that if he was stealing.  Iraq, do you know how many stores the security will just wave you through?  If you have any kind of paper in your hand and you hold the bag out like, here, you  want to check?  They just go, no, go ahead.  Then the Spanish guys get stopped.  The sensor's gone off when I'm walking through and I turn around and they're like, no, you're  good.  Yeah.  Happens all the time.  It's the white privilege they talk about.  Do you know what I want to do when a sensor goes off?  I just want to start screaming. 
[01:26:00]  Like when it's like, meh, meh.  I just want to stand there and go like, ah, help.  Help.  Just scream, help.  Drop your bags.  It's very, very bad to eliminate, like, all retail jobs.  Great.  They won't eliminate all of them.  We were just talking about eliminating all of them.  All of them.  No, maybe some.  It's just a lot of them.  Like 70% of them.  Well, that's not all of them.  That's 70%.  All right.  Well, it's very bad to eliminate 70% of retail jobs.  People will do other things.  Like what?  There's no reason.  Computer jobs.  There's no fucking reason for certain people at certain jobs. 
[01:26:30]  One of the worst places, and I don't know what chicks are fucking, you know, at the  clothing store and stuff, but as a guy in a clothing store, there's nothing some guy's  going to tell me.  You have your own fucking personal taste in clothes.  When you walk in there, how is another guy going to be like, well.  That's not true.  These pants.  It's like, how do you know what I fucking want or like?  I had a fucking Asian gentleman helping me when I was in Barney's.  A fucking, you know, in his 40s, he knew what tie worked with what. 
[01:27:00]  Things I'm not good at.  Upper end stuff, sure.  Or you're at a fucking suit store or something like that.  Yes, I understand.  Bert always helps me in J.Crew.  But if you're just going to the Gap or something, you don't need someone to help you.  Bert helps me in J.Crew every time.  Bert.  You have a guy at J.Crew?  He's always there.  He's a black guy.  He always looks good.  Dressed to the nines.  Black guy named fucking Bert.  Yeah.  Bert.  Wow.  Every time he helps me.  Yeah.  No robot's going to tell me, you know, what shoes should I get?  Yeah. 
[01:27:30]  Why should you get the shoes you like?  No robot's going to hit on J.Crew while you're trying shoes on the fucking J.Crew.  Exactly.  No, you're going to tell me, like, what shoes would be really good with these pants?  And then you put them on, and they're like, I wouldn't have even thought of this.  This looks fantastic.  No robot's going to help you with that.  You just get what you want.  You're going to have the closet from Clueless.  What do you say?  Yeah, you just enter in what color pants you're wearing, and they'll tell you what shoes you need.  What do you say?  No robot is going to make fucking personal decisions for you that you should be making for yourself anyway?  Right.  No, I'll give you advice. 
[01:28:00]  A guy who knows, he's a fashionable guy who can help me out to the next level.  What is that?  You mean gay?  Yeah.  Maybe he's probably gay.  I would assume he is, yeah.  Yeah.  But, that said, he looks fantastic every time I see him.  I think someone's got a crush.  I do, too.  I would date Bert.  Sam was there just to talk to Bert.  He doesn't even need clothes.  Hi, Bert.  Bert goes, what can I help you with today?  Oh, I'm fine.  I'm tapping.  How are you?  How are you?  What do you got coming in the next couple weeks?  You got anything new?  No, Sam, you were here two days ago.  They must be so happy when you come in with your bushy eyebrows. 
[01:28:30]  You think so?  Yeah.  I don't like dealing with people, so I'm happy about the robotic thing.  You got to be more social.  And you got to realize that these have greater consequences.  There's not going to be new jobs for all the jobs being replaced by robots.  Robot jobs.  That's why there's no factory jobs for anybody.  And all the fast food workers want to get, like, livable wages.  Someone's got to grease the bearings on those robots.  Because those jobs were meant for, yeah, you know who greased the bearings on those robots?  Oh.  Chinese people. 
[01:29:00]  Oh.  For a penny a day.  They figured there's this one robot, and it's very adaptable.  You could bring it into, like, a grocery store or anywhere, a factory line job, and it could  be programmed to do what, like, a worker would do, just some menial laborer would do, in a  matter of minutes.  And then it'll work.  And they said that with its lifespan and how much it actually costs, that it works out to,  you're actually paying under $3 an hour for an employee. 
[01:29:30]  See?  Saving money.  With that robot.  Yeah, of course you're saving money, but, like, everybody wants $15 an hour in fast food  because it's the only blue-collar job left.  Oh, fucking.  Because they can't work at a mall parking lot or in the Apple store or any place because  robots are taking over.  Where are people supposed to work?  That's a fucking...  I don't know.  Like, not now, all right, but let's say 40 years from now, or 60 years from now.  The world needs ditch diggers, too, you know.  And what the fuck?  How many holes do we need?  Yeah, that's true.  What are people going to do? 
[01:30:00]  Every two self-service checkout registers is one cashier that does not have a job.  Every two, you mean?  Every two, yeah, because they're small.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But I'd say every two self-service places is one person that's not working.  But it's also, everyone growing up now, coming up, they're all computer literate, so a lot  of them will be in computer jobs.  Like, a lot of them will be tech-savvy and able to survive in the next 50 years because 
[01:30:30]  they're...  I don't know.  You talk to someone with children, and they talk about the shit their kids can do on  an iPad already, and it's like stuff that, you know, I was fucking 38 when I learned  it.  Well, I think if you look back through history, jobs were always being replaced by other types  of jobs.  Now, the robot, though, replaces the actual worker.  That's the difference.  Okay.  So you got, like, the livery stable guy in the Old West, and then all of a sudden they  come up with the horseless carriage.  Oh, my goodness.  So that puts them out of work, but it makes a whole new industry of the automotive industry 
[01:31:00]  and deliveries.  You're going to have cars that can drive themselves.  So not only will all the workers be replaced, you won't even hire a guy to deliver the robots  to the store.  Can you imagine when you get into a cab and just tell it where you want to go and just  take it?  Oh, I don't want that to happen.  It doesn't stink.  It doesn't stink.  It doesn't give you shit in the morning.  You'd know exactly when you were going to kill.  Once everything's computerized, car-wise, that will happen. 
[01:31:30]  This is going to be like minority reports.  Think of the efficiency of driving, Phil.  You'll know exactly.  Yeah, you'll say, I have to leave here.  11 minutes, I'll be there.  And you'll be there in 11 minutes.  You know exactly, right?  No traffic, because we're the assholes fucking stopping looking at dumb shit on the side  of the road.  Half the population will be killed off.  Oh, that would be crazy.  No way.  All people do, though.  What if I do?  What about you, like, 20 years ago?  Yeah.  You would be the one getting killed off.  No.  Yeah.  I have gifts. 
[01:32:00]  I need to give to humanity.  You are obsolete.  You are obsolete.  You make your millions, and then you're like, yep, kill the rest.  I did it.  Fuck them all.  Yep.  Well, not necessarily.  It doesn't have to work down financial, you know, lines as far as who's, you know, who's  working and who's not.  Those are all the, it's not the CEOs that are getting replaced by robots.  Don't you think humanity has to get a little more efficient?  No.  Don't you think we're pretty fucking ragged at this point? 
[01:32:30]  Just making more people, more people that need more jobs and need more food and need  more everything.  How much more efficient are we than bears?  Way more efficient.  Well, you know.  Bears are not efficient.  They don't even have houses.  Did you see that bear taking that garbage can two nights in a row?  But there's not a fuckload of bears walking around.  They're in a forest.  Yeah, but they're not all sitting there at one fucking lake going like, oh, I can't afford  a salmon.  That's a fisher con.  I don't know what we're going to do.  They're getting us a privileged bear. 
[01:33:00]  He's getting more salmon than me.  He should give me his salmon.  No, fuck that.  If bears were efficient, they would have figured out ways to build structures and jobs and  a society.  Their basic anatomy doesn't allow for them to build things.  I've seen a bear try to swing a hammer.  Thumbs.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's a thumb thing.  That's a solid argument.  It's a thumb thing.  Solid argument.  There's just, I kind of like the idea of automation.  Automation, and you're really separating the wheat from the chaff when it comes to humanity, 
[01:33:30]  when the only people that'll be working are, you know, the upper echelon of people.  You know what?  Automation sucks sometimes.  Like, you call somebody or you call a company on the phone, the last thing you want to do  is go through all those things.  Automation sucks every time.  You know what?  You just want to talk to somebody.  Let me tell you something.  You just want to talk to somebody.  Years ago, that was the case.  But these days, the automated phone thing works a lot better than it used to.  I hate the automated phone thing.  I hate it.  I hate it.  All I want to do is talk to somebody.  Just talk to somebody. 
[01:34:00]  You are...  Just hit zero.  Because you can't reason with a computer and go, no, no, here's what happened.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, you can reason with...  It's just choice.  Hello?  Yeah, that's what you need now.  Hello?  Yeah, uh-huh.  What's your problem?  And you think you're getting better answers than pushing one or two or three?  Sure.  I called Time Warner two weeks ago.  Time Warner cable.  What's your problem?  And I ended up getting...  Tell me your problem.  Tell me your problem.  What's your problem?  Oh, I need CBS back. 
[01:34:30]  CBS?  The drugstore?  No, CBS.  What's that?  It's a network you're not currently carrying.  Uh, well, no, we carry all the best.  If we don't have it, then it's not the best.  Okay, well, I want it, so I'm going to leave.  Leave what?  Leave the company if you don't give me a discount.  Uh, let me talk to my, uh, manager.  Okay, I'll hold.  Hello?  Yeah, he's going to take $100 off that true code.  That's not what I'm talking about. 
[01:35:00]  Oh.  You just, you just advocated...  Yeah.  ...for the elimination of the lower class completely.  Yes!  Like, you want an only upper class society.  Yes!  Okay.  Well, then, I mean, I guess that's that, then.  Everyone's just magically upper class.  Like, uh, there, there, there is a way that, through automation, you can weed out the people  that, uh, aren't really essential anymore.  Yeah.  Because that's what, I believe...  That's what the future holds. 
[01:35:30]  ...the basis of the robots are good argument...  Yeah.  ...when you weed it down to what it is at its core, is completely eliminating...  Sure, what we do is we just, we, we, we, we, we build camps, and we just put them there,  and we get rid of the ones who are not efficient.  Camps sounds fun.  It's the same thing.  We're a very efficient society.  Very efficient.  Yeah, yeah, we don't do too bad.  But we'd be more efficient if we could give people jobs.  Oh, the more robots we have, the less jobs will be needed by the menial, you know, the 
[01:36:00]  menial jobs.  The robots will do the menial tasks.  No, they're not.  A lot of the menial jobs are getting weeded out.  They're going to.  Well, you don't even need them anymore.  Just get rid of these people already.  They're human beings.  They have potential to do great things.  All you really need is, like, actors to make TV shows.  There you go.  Even that, no.  Make good TV shows.  Not in the future, because...  CG's.  Why don't we just CGI?  With all CGI stuff, and all this stuff, where you can just program what you want, eventually  you'll be able to program a fucking movie, and it'll just happen. 
[01:36:30]  Yeah.  Or something like it.  Yeah, I mean, because now they can't even, like, there's videos of, oh, look at the shark.  He jumped out and bit the helicopter.  Oh, it's fake.  Yeah.  Hey, is that a real UFO video?  No, it's fake.  Livia Soprano got, like, three or four episodes after she died.  After she was dead.  And, you know?  Yeah, they have a live version concert to Tupac now.  Yeah.  He's getting better than I am.  Tupac's going to perform over the weekend.  Did he?  Yeah.  Really?  And you probably want to live in a society where it's robots operating the holograms. 
[01:37:00]  Yeah, it's more efficient that way.  And imagine, like, you could take that image, right?  Imagine, say, fast forward 15 years of technology.  You could take that image, so you don't have to just show footage that's already been shot.  The computer is good enough to manipulate the footage into whatever would be happening live  and make new footage, because it understands we're going to pull the pixels.  Technology is going to be the death of humanity.  Well, look, throughout history, you've always seen, when things advance, there is a certain 
[01:37:30]  element of the population that cannot adapt, keep up.  I mean, look at, you know, the old serfdoms of England.  Yeah.  You know, those old people that lived outside the castle walls and stuff?  Yeah, but especially if they lived by the ocean.  Oh, sir.  You know, you don't see them around anymore.  No.  Right?  But as this keeps going, like, you will get to a point where you are the person getting weeded out. 
[01:38:00]  Oh, please.  It's impossible.  You think so?  I'm an artist.  I'll always be needed.  What is that, Eazy-E?  Yeah.  Where was this?  Compton?  This was at Rock the Bells.  Yeah, Rock the Bells.  This was Bone Thugs in Harmony.  Straight out of Compton!  This hologram shit is so cool.  Yeah.  Eazy-E, I think it would have been 50, like, last week, too.  Yeah, but he died.  Yeah, he got AIDS and died.  He's, um... 
[01:38:30]  Look at...  Oh, my God, Eazy's on the fucking stage with him.  Do you know, if you did a concert, a tour, where you did Biggie and Tupac together...  Oh, my God.  It would sell out.  Just fucking...  Holograms.  Holograms bullets being flown all over the place.  And you're just watching videos!  Throw in Eazy-E, too.  Oh, what's up, LA?  Make some...  You could do it without any live rappers.  Yep.  That's the society you're looking for. 
[01:39:00]  Well, there you go.  That would be a good...  Straight out of Compton.  How many of them are on stage together?  There's two live guys and one dead guy?  Bone Thugs.  Probably...  At least four guys.  Oh, wait a minute.  Are they all on screens?  No.  No.  Just Eazy.  Okay.  Look at Eazy. 
[01:39:30]  Would you get a photo with Hologram, Eazy-E?  Yeah, I might have to.  The hologram?  Yeah.  Why not?  Because the camera would flash, and you wouldn't be able to see the hologram anymore.  NWA ruled.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, damn.  If I knew where it was going, though, I wouldn't have supported it.  Back in the day.  What year did he die?  What do you mean where it was going?  The group was called Niggas with Attitudes. 
[01:40:00]  Oh, okay.  It was there.  I guess I should have seen it.  What year did he die?  Like, 83?  95.  Oh, I thought it was earlier than that.  95, huh?  The AIDS?  Yeah.  What do you think?  Was he DL?  Was he on the DL?  There are a lot of rumors about Eazy motherfucking E-E?  Oh, was he gay?  I mean, was it needles, or was he...  It's not rumored to be needles.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  The big flesh needle.  Yeah.  Maybe. 
[01:40:30]  Oh, boy.  Hot beef injection.  Right.  Hot beef injection.  That old gag.  Yeah.  Motherfucking Eazy.  It's cool.  And this technology will only get better, too.  Of course it will, until we don't need people anymore.  Because we have holograms.  Oh, man.  And the robots will sit in the audience enjoying the holograms.  Yeah.  Fucking clapping.  And there'll be nine people left just cowering like, oh, no.  Fucking robots.  They'll be the ones making sure that the hologram turns on. 
[01:41:00]  Exactly.  And then the robots are like, oh, wait.  We figured this out on our own.  All they do to applaud, though, is they just fucking spot weld something.  I wonder if they'll be able.  You know how, like, they map for Grand Theft Auto a person, and they match up the movements  to a computer?  I wonder if they'll be able to eventually do that in real live time, where there's a guy  behind the screen making movements, and the computer is so amazing, it can take, like,  John Lennon and have him match the movements of the guy behind.  Oh, some guy with motion capture, right? 
[01:41:30]  I'm sure they could.  I mean, they could.  This way the guy can interact live with the audience.  But maybe they won't even need the guy to do that.  Yeah, I don't think they will.  They're easily, within a few years, I would think.  Within a million years.  Yeah, within a million years.  I said billion.  Oh.  Within a billion years, I see this happening.  Sooner than later, I would say.  You're definitely going to be able to have holograms that can interact with an audience,  that can respond to cues, and yeah, definitely.  Cues, yeah, but I mean real live, like this amazing moment we're having. 
[01:42:00]  No, you're going to need human beings.  Yeah.  And that's why your world of robots and holograms, where everything's so efficient.  Oh, I love efficiency.  There's no room for human life, though.  Well, there is.  You need good human life.  You need human error.  Smart, strong people.  Look, we know who you're trying to eliminate.  What?  Just people that might not be as apt to contribute.  Do you want rappers or all musicians replaced by holograms? 
[01:42:30]  I kind of like that rap hologram thing.  Yeah, you do, right?  You know?  It makes the shows safer.  You think so?  Yeah.  No one's fucking disrespecting anybody.  Robots are shooting each other.  Yes.  Robots.  That would be great.  Fucking robots.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's take a little break.  Let's make love.  And we'll make love.  I'm not going to.  We'll...  Oh, look at that.  I have to plug something when we get back.  Why don't you plug?  October 10th and 11th.  I'll do it now. 
[01:43:00]  I'm going to be in fucking Doylestown at the Comedy Cabaret working on material.  Doylestown.  I love it there.  I really do.  It's an old school comedy club.  It's very small.  And I have like a...  You know, it'll be a good show.  But I mean, it's going to be me working on material.  I'll probably have paper with me up there.  And it'll be fun.  Yeah.  It's really...  I love, love, love going out and doing that.  That sounds like a cool thing to see.  Yeah.  I would go.  Yeah.  And I'm doing the Beacon with Dice.  I just don't know exactly when we're going on sale.  Yay!  Very soon. 
[01:43:30]  Yeah.  It was just put together.  Yeah.  Cool.  Yeah, I'm doing the Beacon with Dice.  The Dice meme.  Yeah.  All right.  And we'll return...  Allegedly.  Allegedly.  In moments.  Continues in moments. 
[01:44:00]  Yeah, it did say we'll be back shortly.  But then all of a sudden we're back.  So I guess it was shortly.  Moments meeting right now.  That's one of those operator errors you're going to fix by robot.  Robots wouldn't know well in advance, years in advance, what was going to play at that  very moment.  I don't know.  Right.  Ah, the Nagel.  Ah, the robot. 
[01:44:30]  I hear the Nagel and Roland had a pretty good weekend, huh?  Oh!  Roland, why don't you step up to the little microphone?  I'd love to hear about your weekend.  Were you hanging out with the Nagel?  The Nagels.  The Nagels.  Yeah, both.  Oh!  No, he was his wife.  Iraq.  Iraq.  Nice.  And where were you guys?  At the...  Compound West.  Ah, well, not that compound. 
[01:45:00]  No.  Wouldn't it be Compound East?  And it would be East.  East, yeah.  I don't know.  It's just some beach house, I guess.  You were at the Opie's?  Yes.  At the...  In the Hamptons.  Mm-hmm.  Yes, yes, yes.  Wow!  How was that?  You took the helicopter and...  Would have been nice.  Yeah?  Yeah, nice, yeah.  Yeah, was it nice out?  Just over there?  Was it cold?  It was cold.  Well, I enjoyed it.  Did you go in the water?  Hell, no, I didn't swim.  Oh, that's right.  I did have him over the house once. 
[01:45:30]  He almost drowned in my pool.  Yeah.  But, uh, what about Iraq?  Iraq.  Hi.  Did you, uh...  By the way, so far you guys are finalists  in the fucking worst beach stories  in history competition.  Wow.  Just trying to find out what you did over the way.  I heard, I heard, uh,  Iraq and Roland had a beach weekend.  Yes, we went out to see, uh,  Opie's Beach House on the Hamptons.  Yeah.  It was nice.  Yeah. 
[01:46:00]  Um, very cold and windy,  so it wasn't really...  Oh, man.  ...an enjoyable beach day per se.  Oh, per se.  But, um, the place was nice,  the area was nice.  Yes.  And, uh, there was a big wedding  going on on the beach,  like two houses over from, uh...  We didn't crash it.  We tried to get Roland.  He was almost there  with taking his clothes off  in the middle of the night,  walking over to the tent.  Destroyed a person's fucking big day.  Yeah.  That's great.  Well, you guys have done nothing. 
[01:46:30]  That's, um...  Nope.  You did nothing this weekend.  Thanks for bringing it up.  Yeah.  Just trying to, you know,  see what you guys did.  Now that you've mentioned  fun shit, you didn't do.  You didn't sweat  and you didn't ruin the wedding.  Y-Rock, you didn't frolic  in the water at all?  It was too cold.  Ugh.  What a couple of duds.  We just walked down there  and both Roland and I were like,  yeah, this is too cold.  We're not doing this.  If you can't go in the water,  there's no reason  to be on the beach.  Exactly.  There's fucking no reason.  What about the fire?  Roland was digging holes  and making castles 
[01:47:00]  with Opie's son.  Oh.  And then Opie's son  would just get all annoyed,  Roland, and just start  throwing sand into his face,  into his clothes.  Oh my God.  Why?  And he destroyed the castle.  Yeah.  He destroyed the castle?  Everything he built.  Why was he annoyed at Roland?  Because Roland was helping him  with everything.  And then when he'd put,  he'd have like,  he'd collect seashells  as his treasure  and some other stuff.  And Roland goes,  oh really?  And we'd take it  and throw it into the ocean  or throw it over his shoulder,  push the dune over  that he built.  He's a kid.  Yeah.  He wants to play. 
[01:47:30]  Yeah, that's how you play.  You just annoy him.  Something I have to understand  about Roland  is he is right on the level  of three and four year olds.  Go ahead.  When my daughter comes here,  the two of them  are the worst influences  on each other.  Oh man.  They'll just yell at each other  in the hallways.  And you can't stop Roland.  I can stop my daughter,  but you can't stop Roland.  No, no, Roland will keep going.  Roland's the type,  I've seen him.  It's great.  Specifically around Travis's daughter.  He's the type that will  go for a little 
[01:48:00]  playful competition  with a kid  and then fight his hardest.  Like, just make sure he wins.  Like, if it's a tug of war,  he's ripping that rope.  The kid's going to have rope burn  by the time Roland's done.  I think Obi-San  had a little water balloon  so I went up there  and filled the big ones.  Yeah.  And so you're launching them  and it's exploding right.  Kept one after another.  The kid's crying.  Yeah.  I feel bad.  Oh man.  Did he get yelled at?  The kid has this little pump  that you make water balloons  maybe about two inches big, right?  Roland goes, 
[01:48:30]  screw this,  takes a handful of the balloons,  goes up to the hose.  Now they're like six to eight inches big  and he's just lobbing them at the kid.  They're exploding.  The kid's crying.  What an asshole.  Boys having fun at the beach,  you got Molotov cocktails.  Where'd you sleep?  Well, Roland slept on the beach  for a while.  What?  Because we dug a big fire pit  and had the fire going  for a few hours  but Roland just  couldn't function  so as soon as he sat down  his head went back  over the back end  of the beach chair 
[01:49:00]  and as everyone's talking  every now and then  you're hearing  like, oh, Roland's sleeping.  Were you having a beer in your rock  just talking?  Yeah, hanging out.  Having a brewski?  Yes.  What kind of food was there?  Were they cooking food?  Ah, yeah.  He tried.  Cooking food.  What do you mean he tried?  He couldn't do it?  Roland would not let  somebody live down  the fact that they ruined  perfectly good steak.  Oh, no.  What happened?  He tried to cook a steak.  How'd he do it? 
[01:49:30]  Wrong.  Well, what'd he do wrong?  Wrong.  Well, it's like when you do a steak  and you put barbecue sauce  like marinade with barbecue sauce.  Yeah.  That's a rule when you don't do.  You don't put it  before you cook it.  Hey, these look about done  without actually cutting open  the meat  and checking to see  if it's done.  Yeah, these look done.  You start taking them off.  First, they weren't cooked enough  and then he's like,  okay, now they're done cooking  and then they were overcooked.  I like overcooked.  Oh, no.  That's great.  That's why Jake LaMotta was,  don't overcook it  defeats its own purpose.  Bring it over. 
[01:50:00]  Yeah.  Oh, no.  Then when they offer you seconds,  I'm like, I'm good.  Aren't you hungry?  I am.  Oh.  So you're saying  you had a miserable steak dinner.  Well, I just said  next time we should  just focus on  what we do.  Well.  Best cooking.  Wow.  Oh.  Did you want to grill it?  Sort of.  Yeah, I saw  just all the mistakes happening.  I'm like,  ugh.  Like when you only  you turn the steak over once.  Right.  That over.  Get the grill marks.  Right, right, right. 
[01:50:30]  You leave it.  One turn.  You cook some on side.  You could keep on  rotating it for the grill marks.  That's fine.  Yeah.  Just one turn.  Yeah.  Why didn't you do it?  You could write it.  Why didn't you just jump in there?  Like Patrice used to  take over the grill.  Oh, I know.  Patrice was great with that.  But it was at my house  and I was just like, oh.  Oh, no.  My stomach and I  look at each other going.  Did you have a dry burnt steak?  A barbecue-y dry burnt steak.  And the barbecue sauce  turns into like fucking burnt.  He put everything on it  that he possibly could. 
[01:51:00]  Yeah.  Blue cheese, horseradish,  barbecue sauce,  anything that was on there.  He tried it.  He tried it.  Yeah, yeah.  People are trying.  Oh, man.  Did you cry?  I tried to.  Yeah, maybe he did it on purpose.  I tried to.  For making his kid cry  by throwing water balloons at him.  He's like, good.  I'll go fucking give you  a shitty steak.  Then touche.  Mission accomplished.  Then touche.  And the chicken he cooked 
[01:51:30]  was good.  It just just,  the steak was.  Yeah, the steak wasn't there.  Yeah, but he had no  reservations about reminding him  throughout the night  and the next day about,  well, he's like,  you hungry?  Yeah, you know,  that steak really  just didn't do anything.  Or I was like,  oh, you're not cooking  steak again, are you?  Oh, you kept jabbing him  about it.  Yeah.  So you guys were there  the whole weekend?  We tried to,  at one point,  he was getting ready  to do the fire  and he doesn't have  a newspaper or anything  to start it.  So we're like,  oh, is there a 7-Eleven  around? 
[01:52:00]  We'll go get some  newspapers, whatever.  But Roel and I were thinking,  you know,  there's probably a pizza place  down there,  something like that.  We kept trying  and he wouldn't  let us leave.  So we just like,  oh, okay.  Because he figured  that you'd just go  to the LIE and leave.  Yeah, you're trapped there.  Oh, there's a 7-Eleven  in Manhattan.  We'll just go right there.  Fucking distributors  cut like the snowcat  at fucking,  well, you know,  the overlook.  I can't remember  the overlook.  He's jiggling it  between his hands. 
[01:52:30]  Over.  There's some loud bellies  to be grumbling.  But he found enough stuff  in the place  to get that fire going.  So we were just like,  oh, yeah, great.  How many nights  were you there?  Just Saturday night.  So where'd you sleep?  There was a lot of bedrooms  in that house.  Yeah.  A lot.  So my wife and I  had our own bedroom.  Roland went,  once we got him off.  Stick it in.  Right.  Stick it in.  I'm sorry.  That was not cool.  What a juvenile thing to say. 
[01:53:00]  It's that seat, right?  Blame it on that seat.  Stick it in.  But did you?  Did you do any of that  fucking at Opie's beach house?  Yeah, they were on the top floor  over the beach.  We were guests in that house.  That's not polite.  Oh, you didn't stick it in?  Polite.  Not even a little bit?  Did you when you were there?  Probably.  I would think so.  Oh, you might have stuck it in.  It was a while.  It was like a month or more ago.  Yeah.  But I would hope  that I stuck it in at some point.  I would have wanted to for sure.  Oh, yeah.  Wouldn't have been my call not to. 
[01:53:30]  So we drug Roland off the beach  and we had him on the couch  in the living room.  Oh.  It's about 11 o'clock.  We were watching a movie.  What were you watching?  Anchorman.  It's a great movie.  It's not a great movie.  It is a great movie.  It's a funny movie.  I'm sure it is.  It's a comedy Hollywood put out  and you're not going to lie to it.  I'm sure it is.  Somebody had haterade  with their oatmeal this morning.  Wow.  I'm not saying I wouldn't enjoy  a Will Ferrell comedy  just on a Saturday night  on a beach  after a lousy steak.  It doesn't sound like  a fun Saturday night.  All right.  Maybe in that context.  I understand. 
[01:54:00]  Hey, guys.  What do you want to do?  Want to go get some hookers?  Now let's watch Anchorman  be hungry.  Well, some people were going to bed.  So we were just...  Who went to bed?  Opie.  At 11 o'clock on a Saturday?  He thought it was like  one or two o'clock at night.  And we're like,  no, it's 11 o'clock.  And he's like,  all right, I'm going to bed.  And he just went upstairs.  They just left me two mows  down in the fucking...  Everybody else was down there.  Two mows.  That's why I can't go there  because I'm so wide awake all night.  Oh, my God, right.  I can't be in someone's house.  Yeah.  Plus, I'd fall asleep at 5.30 
[01:54:30]  and that fucking dumb sun  would fucking shine through the window  and I'd be like,  ugh.  Yeah.  I'd get a half hour of sleep  and they'd probably have blackout curtains.  You know there'd be  a hustle and hustle going on  at 6 a.m.  And I'd be like,  no, I got to sleep  until fucking, you know, 2.  How far from Anthony's was it?  It's far.  It's far.  It's far.  It's like two hours from the city.  Yeah.  That's a hell of a trip out there, huh?  But he did.  Doesn't make delicious chicken, though.  I slept a lot when I was out there. 
[01:55:00]  Yeah.  We were out there like  earlier in the summer  and I was able to sleep  like all morning.  You can stick it in?  I think, I would hope so.  But wait,  was the room bright in the morning?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I don't know.  You shouldn't see 7 a.m. on a Sunday.  It's a beach house.  Unless you're going to bed.  No, you're right.  How do you fucking sleep like that?  Yeah.  I woke up at 5  because I have allergies  from the cats.  Yeah, there's a lot of wild cats  in that area.  Not in the house, though. 
[01:55:30]  No, but all around the house.  Is there a fan on them  outside the window?  How are you getting allergic  inside the house?  Well, the woman,  they apparently had cats before  in the house.  Oh, in the house.  I got the room  that had that cat.  He was getting this weird film  across his eyes  that he was peeling off.  Yeah.  It's like an alien thing.  It's like a guy  when I was at Sam's house  from your Bruiser Brody.  Yeah, but that's because  there was a cat  sitting on your belly.  Not like...  Well, I think the cat  was in that room before.  Like so much gunk  would build up in his eye. 
[01:56:00]  It was like a film.  Like a film?  You'd just peel it.  Oh, man.  We had to get rolling  out of the house  when he was over.  That's crazy.  Do you like cats?  What?  Do you like cats?  Not when they YouTube me  like that, no.  It's like those...  When they shed a lot,  it just kills me.  Yeah.  It just kills me, too.  I love them, too,  but they fucking  drive me nuts.  Aw, well.  Not little Beavis.  No.  He doesn't even shed.  Oh, no?  Well, he's a kitten.  Right.  I don't know.  Probably later.  Soon he'll be  big, fat, monstrous, 
[01:56:30]  Bruiser Brody.  I can't wait  until he's leaving  shit all over  Anthony's house  and he's not cute  anymore.  No, no.  And he's got all  these bad habits.  He's 28 pounds  taking fucking  liquidy, you  cat dumps.  That's adorable.  I cracked the  100,000 view mark  on the little  kitten taking  my glasses video.  Well, it's not  going to be so...  It's not going to be  that many views  when I was thinking  about you last night  when you had to  prop up a piece  of cardboard  outside your bedroom door  and then shut the  door before he jumps  over the cardboard.  Oh, he's so adorable. 
[01:57:00]  I would break the  cat out of those  habits in a minute.  Yeah.  We could just have  a cat that was  aggressive and scared  in the corner all the  time.  You said your advice  was to throw him  against a wall.  I'm not going to  take it.  Oh, that's terrible.  Oh, it was on the  Yahoo front page,  huh?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's huge  right there.  Jesus.  Do they have Anthony  Kumi listed at least?  Probably not.  How do they not  know who you are?  It doesn't look like  you.  No, it doesn't.  It's funny, though.  It's like all it  takes is one fucking 
[01:57:30]  kitten.  Hey, there's a kitten.  You fucking throw him  the first.  And that's literally  the first thing he  ever did.  But you're a shock  jock.  That's even a better  story is that you're  this fucking piggish  shock jock.  Right.  Horrible person.  And then you have  this adorable cat  removing your glasses.  You either have to  get fired from your  radio job or get a  kitten to be on the  front page of Yahoo.  That is true.  I've done both.  Yeah.  Yes.  I got a video like  that.  No, you're right.  No, let's hear  what is it?  He doesn't chip. 
[01:58:00]  Fucking tiger  taking my glasses.  A grown tiger?  Fuck yeah.  It did.  So what did you do  about your allergies?  I just went outside  at a beach.  And then they went  away?  No, it just kept on  going.  What were you guys  drinking out there?  Just Corona.  Corona.  Linen Kugel.  Have you ever had  that?  What?  That's so sweet.  Kugel.  Linen Kugel.  No.  Linen Kugel. 
[01:58:30]  It's a great beer.  Oh.  Is it?  Yeah.  What kind of...  What is it?  It's from...  I think it's from  Wisconsin or something.  Wisconsin.  It's from Wisconsin.  It's really good.  It's not good.  What kind of...  What kind of lemon  vegan did you have?  Were you getting  hammered?  The sunset wheat  tastes like fruity pebbles.  It was great.  Were you getting hammered?  No.  I was doing alright.  Why?  Were you tipsy?  Because I didn't want 
[01:59:00]  to at that place.  You didn't have to drive.  With somebody who was  trying to make viral  videos on the beach  all afternoon.  I really did not want  to get into that  mindset.  What happened?  He just kept  pointing at things  and he would say,  Roland, let's make  a viral video.  Go over there.  Roland's like, no.  You wouldn't do it, Roland?  No.  You wouldn't be party  to that?  I was tired.  I just wanted to sit  on the beach and sleep.  That's Roland's idea  of getting away,  just fucking relaxing  on the beach.  Chill out.  You have your sunglasses on?  Yeah. 
[01:59:30]  But then when someone  built a castle,  I helped him.  Then he smashed it  and I smashed it.  But it was cold?  Yeah, it was very windy.  Can't wait on the beach  when it's fucking cold  and windy.  I love it.  Cold.  No.  I saw the picture of you,  though.  You had your arms  tucked into your t-shirt.  Must have been freezing.  Wow.  Then it was probably  really cold.  I remember.  Yeah, at that point,  he was bending  the chair back so far  next to his feet  hanging almost  in the fire  and then tucking  his arms inside 
[02:00:00]  his t-shirt  to almost make  like he was mummified.  Yeah.  And just head back  and loud noises  coming out.  Just the loud  and light fires  right there on the beach?  Yeah.  Yeah.  There was about  four or five fires  just spaced out.  Because they're all  private beaches.  That's pretty cool.  What are you going to do?  What's going to happen?  You're by the biggest  water source  in the fucking universe.  What better place  for a fire  than next to the ocean?  The earth's piss. 
[02:00:30]  So,  yeah,  where did you get  the firewood?  He had it.  He bought bags  of firewood  and the wedding  later on that night  the wedding  a couple houses down  tried to  one of the crew  thought it would be  cool to make a fire  because everybody else  around them  was making fires.  Yeah.  Threw everything in  and I guess  was just grabbing  anything flammable  tablecloths  and whatever  throwing it in there.  The fire was  shooting out sparks  so bad  that they had to  get other people over  because they were  almost setting  the dunes on fire. 
[02:01:00]  Oh,  yeah,  see,  that's the biggest problem.  They weren't,  yeah,  the guy just lit a fire  and walked away from it.  Didn't control it.  Didn't pay attention to it  and these huge sparks  are just shooting out  into the grass  right next to all the houses.  Only you.  So I'm sitting there  waiting for the big fire  thinking here's your viral video  and nothing happened.  There's your fire.  Fucking burning  all the houses down.  I don't see that  being a big fire though.  Like you've never heard  like the wildfires  out in a beach named.  It's always the woods.  You just throw 
[02:01:30]  fucking sand on it.  Yeah,  the sand and water.  You have fire.  The two biggest fire killers  sand and water.  Exactly.  Fire is a better shot  in interstellar space  than on the beach.  See,  because there's no oxygen.  Yes,  of course.  There's a lot of wood houses there.  It would catch on pretty easy.  That would be bad.  That's true.  Well,  that sounds like  a fun-filled little weekend.  Set the fucking  no blackout curtains.  I couldn't go for it.  And the bad steak.  And the bad steak.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Did you have enough to drink? 
[02:02:00]  Yeah,  there was more than enough.  They overbought,  definitely.  They died Cokes?  There was died Cokes,  Coke Zeroes.  Cool.  Dr. Peppers.  Pretzels?  Yeah,  but they had cheese on them  because this kid likes them.  I know that,  but what about the adults  who don't like cheddar pretzels?  That does sound delicious.  No,  there was a lot of  kid-related food,  which was  right up my alley.  Perfect.  I love a good kid food,  believe me.  Chili Fritos were delicious.  Who doesn't love  a fucking hot dog 
[02:02:30]  with cheese already in it?  I challenge you.  Oscar Mayer?  I'd never had one  until my kids  started eating them.  They're delicious.  Yeah,  of course they are.  You didn't eat them raw,  though.  No.  I eat them raw.  Ew.  You eat raw hot dogs?  The Oscar Mayer  cheese ones?  I'll eat them raw.  You're such a weirdo.  Ew,  really?  He doesn't want to wait.  Yeah,  I can't wait that 60 seconds.  It's way too long.  No,  it's not frozen,  refrigerated.  Ew.  I'm not saying  it's healthy.  I just said I've done it.  No,  it just sounds disgusting.  How bad is a fucking  hot dog cold 
[02:03:00]  out of the fridge?  Especially with the cheese  in it,  like coagulated.  What do you dip it in?  Nothing.  You just bite it in his mouth  because it's an asshole.  His mouth.  His asshole  in his mouth.  Oh,  how terrible you are.  Did your wife ever catch you  eating a fucking  out of the fridge  cold cheese weenie?  Haven't done it in years,  but I used to do that.  Because that's  that's eventually  what's going to spark  the fucking  stabbing with the scissors  or the fucking  call to the lawyer.  It's going to be  she peeks in the room  like she's all  dolled up waiting for him 
[02:03:30]  and he's watching cartoons  eating a fucking  frozen cheese weenie  and then she's going to  fucking hire someone  to cut his throat.  That's how you're going to  catch his wife  on fucking video  going,  my husband has to be killed.  I caught him watching  a fucking  a Spaceman cartoon  eating a fucking  cold cheese hot dog  with fucking  potato chip crumbs  in his fingernails.  I want him dead.  I want him dead.  I want him dead.  Will you have insurance?  No,  I don't.  I've never taken out insurance.  I just want him killed. 
[02:04:00]  It's usually,  you know,  Chef Boyardee in the can.  Cold?  Oh,  God.  You eat cold  Chef Boyardee?  Cold SpaghettiOs.  Oh,  God,  it's just terrible.  It's minutes.  Just wait  and you like a nice meal.  Open it up  and you're good to go.  That's why it's canned.  barely passable.  Heat it up.  Cold Chef Boyardee?  Yeah.  You eat like Lenny  from Mice and Men.  That's what Lenny would eat.  SpaghettiOs with hot dogs?  Yeah,  my brother liked that stuff  when he was six. 
[02:04:30]  I mean,  you eat pizza squares.  Yeah,  but I heat them up.  Yeah.  It's true.  You told me.  I can wait for minutes  before I actually have to  shovel them in my fat face.  It's already cooked.  Certain things have to be heated up  just to taste good.  And spaghetti  or SpaghettiOs  is one of those things.  Do you like them cold,  E-Rock,  or are you just impatient?  I never cook them.  Right out of the can,  into a bowl,  and good to go.  What a weirdo.  You just nuke it  for like 30 seconds at most.  No,  because it tastes weird then. 
[02:05:00]  Does it?  Yeah.  As opposed to just cold  out of a can?  Yeah,  it does.  God,  you're like a fucking  nuclear war survivor.  Herb's kid is going to be like,  Dad,  can you heat this up?  No,  you don't need it heated.  They're never going to know  it heated up.  No.  It's just going to be as is.  My friend has this microwave.  Who's a better doomsday prepper  than E-Rock?  We're all going to be fucking crying  about how shitty things are  when the fucking world ends  and this dummy will be going  right on like nothing shit.  You're going to eat everything  in the first day.  Yeah.  It'll be all cold. 
[02:05:30]  Heat it?  Why?  Why would you?  Yeah.  I don't know,  because it's fucking...  I can't believe my life  hasn't changed at all  since Tuesday.  Yeah,  not exactly.  This is great.  What do you mean?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh my God.  Don't knock it  until you try it.  But it sounds good,  but the sauce is just kind of...  Yeah,  that's what it is.  The sauce.  And just things that congeal  a little bit  and get a gelatinous kind of thing  to it when they're cold.  How do you fucking eat that?  Eee.  It's good. 
[02:06:00]  No.  It's not.  What about soup?  No,  soup's got to be heated up.  Soup is delicious.  Oh.  But I get it.  I get it out of the...  The only thing he heats  is gazpacho.  Soup's got to be heated up.  Campbell's Chicken and Stars.  It doesn't even get  like good soup.  Wait,  what's Chicken and Stars?  It's Campbell's Soups.  But what's in it?  Chicken and pasta  shaped as stars.  Looks like fucking... 
[02:06:30]  It's what kids eat.  How come you don't  just get Chicken Noodle Soup?  I said I get both.  Why do you like  the Stars Pasta?  Do you see  what it says on the label?  Healthy Kids?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, healthy  with fucking  18 tablespoons of salt  in each can.  Yeah, like 50,000 grams  of sodium.  It's crazy.  Isn't sodium salt?  Correct.  Yeah.  Then you add more to it.  You add more salt  to your Campbell's Soup?  Not to Campbell's Soup, 
[02:07:00]  but I would do it  to like a cup of soup.  It's 20% sodium.  You're going to have  a fucking heart attack.  Isn't cup of soup saltier?  Like cup of noodles?  The ramen noodles,  I think it is.  That's way saltier.  That packet you put in  is like all salt.  Yeah, this in one bowl  is 20% of your daily sodium.  20% and that's it.  You shouldn't put salt on that.  No, Eric.  You don't need it.  You're going to die.  My mother,  as much as she was annoying,  the Nortons had a bland...  Oh, did they?  The Nortons were big fans  of small portions 
[02:07:30]  of couscous.  Oh, the bland diet.  Yeah, let's be honest.  It wasn't terrific,  but she taught me  how to use salt  and it was one  of the best things  she did was total.  I stopped that  fucking habit years ago.  You just douse it  in pepper now.  I do like pepper.  Oh, I like a good  peppered up everything.  Good peppering.  I like the bread bowl  of soup.  Do you like the bowl  that's made out  of the fucking bread?  The sourdough bread, yeah.  It sounds good.  It is.  Yeah.  It's a nice tomato soup  inside.  When you're done.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's a taco salad.  Yes, you eat  the fucking bowl. 
[02:08:00]  It's delicious.  It's very efficient.  Yeah.  Look at the sodium  on a cup of noodles.  Oh, it's through the roof.  Is it?  Yeah.  It's almost...  It's like all sodium  in some pasta.  P.F. Chang's  has a high sodium.  Yeah, exactly.  The Japanese like  their salty treats.  Is that what it is for you?  Yeah.  A nice salty treat?  What the fuck is it  that they gotta just  salt the shit out of this stuff?  Eric eats salt licks.  What do you know?  Salt.  Okay.  It's just sitting in the fucking...  On the floor in the living room 
[02:08:30]  a salt lick.  He goes over to him.  Cup of noodles.  The chicken one.  Oh, the chicken one?  Chicken one.  Cup of noodles, chicken flavor.  One serving.  Mm-hmm.  44% of your daily sodium intake.  What happens if you pour  a little salt on it?  Yeah, yeah.  That's probably 80%.  It makes it good.  Wow.  35% of your saturated fat.  So cup of noodles.  He says,  I don't put salt  on Campbell's soup.  I put it on cup of noodles.  Cup of noodles has  double the sodium 
[02:09:00]  to Campbell's.  I think the P.F. Chang  General Tao's chicken  is the highest sodium  for takeout food.  Is it really?  It's so bad.  You know,  if I've had some  goddamn pretty good soups  that weren't  fucking salty,  it's crazy.  Thanks, Nana.  That was a real Nana thing to say.  I've had wonderful soups.  Let me tell you about a few.  Oh my God,  what are we doing? 
[02:09:30]  Talking about fucking salty soup.  That's funny.  Sounds like our code word.  I'm not full of salty soup.  I dumped the old salty soup on our back.  See, it's come.  Oh my God.  I agree.  Well, that is a lot, though.  That's fucking...  I'm not saying do it at home.  I'm just saying  how I eat it.  When do you...  In what context  do you eat a cold  SpaghettiOs?  Is it a snack?  Is it a nice lunch  for your snack? 
[02:10:00]  It's when I get home.  Who's snack?  Oh, Eric gets home.  That's his  after school snack.  After school.  Takes his shoes off.  He goes,  oh, snack time!  Pops on some cartoons.  Do you watch a lot of cartoons?  I haven't lately,  but I used to...  Yeah, I do at times.  I just haven't lately.  Oh.  All times.  You've been missing it?  No, I'm watching  a lot of British stuff now.  You asked...  Oh, British stuff.  Eric loves British television.  Hang on.  Really?  You asked Eric,  do you watch cartoons?  Keep in mind, 
[02:10:30]  today,  he's wearing  a Nightmare Before Christmas  He-Man mash-up T-shirt.  What kind of mash-up is that?  Jack Skeleton as Skeletor.  It's Jack Skeleton's face  where Skeletor's face  should be.  Who would even know that?  Oh.  Yeah.  B-Rock.  People born after the 70s.  Oh, shame.  I shouldn't talk.  Face to you.  Is it laundry day?  Video game shame.  Well, no.  No, it's...  You know what? 
[02:11:00]  It's for GTA 5.  It's on Friday.  So it's kind of cool.  Yeah, I know.  It went back to the top  of the rotation.  Really promoting that game, huh?  Yeah, yeah.  Do you know how many people  ask if you're in that game?  I know.  All the time.  I don't think I'm allowed to say.  Oh, you didn't?  Oh, just say.  No, I just say like,  oh, you know,  well, stay tuned.  I'm in it.  No, you're not.  Are you?  Yeah.  I'm the car.  One of my favorite  video game stories  is Jimmy talking about  when you got GTA 
[02:11:30]  and couldn't back the car  out of the garage  and said, fuck it.  I'll be honest.  I don't know what to do  with video games.  I just got the fucking  Epix was so nice.  They sent me a brand new Xbox.  Oh, can I have it?  I think I'm giving it  to my nephew  or I would give it to you.  I think my nephew  might want it.  Yay.  Yay.  It's like money.  Brand new.  Yeah.  But what am I going to do  with this?  The only reason I keep  my fucking PlayStation  is because it's my DVD player.  Oh.  Otherwise,  nerds to that too.  It could fucking,  it could take a hike-a-roo.  You don't play a game.  No, you. 
[02:12:00]  Why would I?  I stink at them.  I need a controller.  Can't do it.  Yeah, we,  I'm psyched.  There's GTA 5 coming out.  Something of yours  got leaked, actually.  17.  Yeah, I know.  Lazlo was none too happy  about that.  What got leaked?  One of the commercials,  in-game commercials.  How did it get leaked?  Leaked.  And it's, you know,  I may have participated in it.  In the leaking?  No.  In the leaked item. 
[02:12:30]  But, yeah, Lazlo's like,  yeah, fucking people.  It's very hard to keep  things under wraps.  Yeah.  How long have they been  working on this game?  A couple of months.  Years, yeah.  Over six months.  Coming out on the 17th.  Yeah.  And it looks really cool.  Lazlo's coming in on Friday.  Yeah.  Stunt advertise a lot on TV  and show a lot of the  in-game graphics.  It looks amazing.  Advertising-wise,  what's been really cool  is here and in L.A.,  I don't know about other cities,  but they've taken  full buildings.  And some of them  are painted.  Some of them 
[02:13:00]  are just, you know,  the plastic covers  like they do for billboards.  Yeah.  But some of them  are painted  and they paint  massive murals  of, like,  one character  from the game  and it says GTA V  and it takes up  the entire building.  This is how I know  it's a new video game  when we saw a commercial  last night during Breaking Bad.  Yeah.  My wife goes,  I can't wait to watch you play that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And she's serious,  like,  because it's such a beautiful game.  Yeah, it looked like a movie.  Yeah.  You're just slaughtering hookers  and you're like,  this is beautiful.  Yeah, look at me.  Enjoying this?  Look at me, hon.  Meanwhile, she's like 
[02:13:30]  transferring bank funds  on the computer  while you're doing that.  That's why she likes  to watch you do that.  Because she's setting up  like Julia Roberts  and sleeping with the enemy.  She's going to make  a break for it one day.  Are you going to find  a wedding ring in the toilet?  No, no, no.  Keep playing.  Keep playing.  Yeah, go ahead.  Go ahead.  Run the man over  and go steal a, you know,  an ice cream bar.  Beautiful.  Beautiful.  Yeah.  Look at these graphics, hon.  She's cashing out.  She's just,  yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  You're fucking sitting there  glued to the TV.  She's looking at the back  of your dumb head.  Did you see the colors on there? 
[02:14:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Oh.  What are you doing, Sam?  Well, there's...  It made its way over here.  What was it?  The smell of Jim Norton's  butthole.  Oh, God.  That's like those  fucking goddamn  Lee and Morty commercials.  The old fucking couple  with the Swiffer mops and stuff.  Oh, yeah.  Oh.  What a fucking...  How would that guy  remain married to that woman?  Morty? 
[02:14:30]  Did you hear what I said, Morty?  Morty's trying to sleep.  And this bitch  has her Swiffer thing.  She's cleaning like a lamp.  Morty, are you listening to me?  Oh.  I'd crack that handle.  Make sure it makes  a sharp edge  and like a vampire.  I'd thrust it  through her old heart.  Do you watch it?  They're so annoying.  Yeah, I know what you saw.  You don't like Lee and Morty?  I hate Lee and Morty.  Maybe Jim Norton.  Aw, they're adorable.  No.  Except extraordinary impact.  That's the everyday effect. 
[02:15:00]  We set out across the world  to prove it.  Here's the real story  of Lee and Morty,  a 90-year-old couple  in Valley Stream, New York.  You all live happily ever after.  I have to tell you,  that's the beginning  and end of the story.  My name is Lee Kaufman.  I'm 90 years old.  Wow.  Married to Morty Kaufman.  I'm also 90.  I'm older than  my young bride here.  Oh.  I have about four months.  Oh, it's Myra.  They're the couple  everybody wants to be.  And that's really cool. 
[02:15:30]  I've never seen this.  This is like a three-minute piece.  Like long form.  This is beautiful.  What's your problem with them?  I'll say this.  Lee and Morty  look pretty fucking good  for 90.  90.  You gotta give it to them,  I guess,  but boy is she annoying.  And they're in love  with each other.  Fuck that.  Love.  Yeah, this is great.  So far,  I'm a big Lee and Morty fan.  Lee and Morty won.  Kumi and nothing.  Well, I didn't know  they did a documentary on him.  Usually they're just  trying to sell mops.  Oh, she's cleaning  with the Swiffer.  She's 90.  What do you want her to do?  Fucking hook her feet  into the drawer 
[02:16:00]  and get on top?  She's an old lady.  I had to make sure  we were watching something.  I dream that one day  Jess and I will have  this kind of affection  for each other  and be in this good shape  at 90.  I dream that Jess  will be that age  grieving your early demise  with her new  African-American husband  at 90.  There's Morgan Freeman.  We still adore each other.  Six children,  44 years  and no complaints. 
[02:16:30]  What else can I say?  Wait, 44 years?  Hold on.  All right.  They were 46  when they got married?  Wow.  Yeah.  Well, they were probably  fucking back then  probably widows.  That's pretty fucking amazing.  They lived to a ripe old age  of 45.  Not only is it  a great love story,  but it gives hope  for everybody  that that one person  is still out there.  44 years.  Maybe they were living  in sin for a long time.  Maybe.  Wouldn't it be funny  if you said that?  Like, yeah,  I was just fucking her  in the ass  for two decades.  Dogging her old keister  for a while. 
[02:17:00]  Dogging her keister.  No woman wants  her husband to say  that he's been  dogging her keister.  How did they have  six kids?  He put his dick in her  and came  more than five times.  If they were married  44 years ago.  Maybe earlier kids  from a different marriage.  Yeah, what do you mean  44 years ago?  You can't have six kids?  This doesn't make sense.  If you're 46,  you can't.  Back then,  a 46-year-old mother  wasn't going to happen.  You're having six kids 
[02:17:30]  if you're 46.  No, no.  What is this?  These people don't make sense.  There's something  going on here.  They're bullshitting  is the problem.  I'm going to look  into this Morty and Lee.  Oh, this is their daughter.  Myra Kaufman?  Jesus,  can they be any more Jewish?  Yes.  My daughter, Myra.  It's Morty and Lee's  daughter, Myra Kaufman.  About them is  how much they still  adore each other.  Six children,  44 years,  and no complaints.  What else can I say?  It's been a happy union. 
[02:18:00]  One of the only things  that's changed  is they don't entertain  as much as they do.  It's important to mom  to have the house clean  and it's really too much.  She uses an old-fashioned  mop and bucket  which no one can pick up.  Very, very heavy.  Oh, it's not heavy.  First of all,  she looks exactly  with her Frank Vincent hairdo  like the old woman  who had her fucking hat  removed from the elevator.  She does from the elevator.  She has an amazing head  of fucking white hair  which I want to see  fucking someone remove  in an elevator. 
[02:18:30]  Like right now,  they're showing her  with the orange mop.  Yes.  And they're showing  the old-fashioned way  of mopping the floor.  Yeah, the old mop  and just the bucket.  I've never wanted  to see a shoe  go whoopsie  up in the air so badly.  I'd like her to slip  and crack that fucking  perfect white hair  on the fucking  stove handle.  You know how nice  that would look  with a big red  fucking patch growing in it?  Oh, would that make  a mess of her?  Oh, she's not  built for taking a fall. 
[02:19:00]  No.  Great slip.  And she was having  trouble with the bucket.  She couldn't get the bucket  out of the sink really.  Those little  translucent fingers.  She's 90  and still in love.  Yeah.  Still mopping.  That's some bullshit.  How are they married  44 years,  six kids, and 90?  They probably  fucking have some  murder-for-hire plot.  They killed  each other's spouses.  You're telling me  mom and pop  were never really  a mom and pop?  Exactly.  I don't know  how this works.  I'm not big enough 
[02:19:30]  or strong enough  for this.  She's trying to  wring the mop out.  I make dirt.  She's tiny,  so she drags  this ridiculous  rickety old  stepstool.  Oh, my God.  Anyway,  and my father's  a nervous wreck.  Be careful, babe.  I know.  Watch out  when you step up.  That's your line.  Be careful.  Okay.  Oh, she's still...  Oh, boy.  Oh, no.  They show her  almost falling.  She almost falls.  And he's helping her.  Oh, no.  This is a love story.  Oh, that's Ted Kaczynski 
[02:20:00]  that left that box.  PNG.  Get up and see  what's cooking in it.  Thank you.  Oh, lovely products  that are all in this box.  They're all Swiffer products?  Yes.  Look at this.  It's got a hand one.  How great would it be  if they get a box  of Swiffer products  and she picks it up  and then grabs her chest  and drops it  like fucking Henry Fondin  on Golden Pond?  She has a life-ending stroke.  Oh, a box of Swiffer products.  Oh, what's this? 
[02:20:30]  It's a box of cocks.  Free puppies.  Free puppies.  Careful, babe.  She's getting on  the old rickety thing.  Oh, gosh.  She almost took a tumble.  And the game is...  He gets behind her  and he puts his nose  in her asshole  while he holds her hips  and she cleans the top  of the fucking  entertainment center.  That's for reaching  higher places.  Yeah, no shit.  A wet jet.  What is this?  A wet jet.  It'll put on your pussy, finally.  It's easier and faster to use. 
[02:21:00]  A wet jet.  That's what Swiss hair was.  Oh, God.  Ah, yes, yes.  Of course it did.  It crashed in the lake.  They're very excited.  Oh, she's mopping.  It's easier and faster to use.  Yeah, you push it  and the water comes out.  It goes all the way  to the back wall  so I know that I'm really  making the floor  as clean as it could possibly be.  Oh, goodness.  I came in  under the assumption 
[02:21:30]  that it was clean.  Oh, boy.  I've been living  in a fool's paradise.  Look at this.  I don't have to climb up.  No, she's just cleaning the top.  It's adjustable.  It has truthfully  everything as clean  as it is now up there.  Morty, are you listening?  Morty's asleep.  They're kissing.  This is a beautiful story.  No.  Not a beautiful story.  They're having an intervention.  There's a fucking  bunch of old people  in the living room  talking about this old cunt.  They're fucking  swiffer products.  Enough with her  cleaning everything  all the time.  Exactly.  OCD.  Let's get to the bottom 
[02:22:00]  of that.  Her fucking OCD.  Well, I was repeatedly  molested and raped  by my father's friends  when I was six.  They sodomized me  on the back  of a rickshaw  and now I'm OCD.  There's some  fucking backstory.  When the Doughboys  came home from Europe,  they needed a woman's company.  Are you listening?  Oh, yes.  I'm so happy  to see them having me.  She loved the way 
[02:22:30]  the house looked.  She was entertaining.  It was kind of like  a little bit of the old days.  She felt great.  Those old people.  Oh, right?  Oh, what a conversation  this must be.  They're dancing.  They're dancing  in the kitchen  in slow motion.  You fucking cheap Jew. 
[02:23:00]  So you see,  those everyday things you do  can have surprising impact.  Maybe more than you realize.  That's the power.  Napping again  or he's dead.  Yeah.  Morty shot himself.  They show him sleeping  but they don't show behind him  where the fucking brains  are all over the kitchen floor  and she swiffers them up.  She fucking wet jets  his brains  off the fucking kitchen floor.  As Lee gets out  of the bathtub  and hugs Jack Nicholson. 
[02:23:30]  That's great.  There's no reason  for you to have  a problem with that.  I can't stand  those fucking two  in the goddamn commercials.  They're in love  with each other.  They're just bitching.  Nah.  Whatever.  Love at that age.  Come on.  It's a habit  at that point.  It's just a fucking habit.  You think they honestly  love each other?  This is why you want  robots to take over.  You have no humanity left.  Love it.  Fuck humanity.  All it is  is a burden  and weakness 
[02:24:00]  at this point.  You gotta move  closer to the light.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So do they.  Any minute now.  Yeah.  Fuck that.  You think people  that have been married  that long  are still in love?  They might be.  I don't know.  I think that's impossible.  I don't think it's possible  to sustain  an emotion that long.  What if you meet  the right person  who just brightens your day?  I honestly don't think 
[02:24:30]  you can sustain  an emotion  for that long.  You've managed with hate.  That's a terrific point.  We wish  you couldn't sustain  an emotion that long.  It does seem like  it's impossible though.  You know.  Especially love.  That really takes a lot.  I can only speak 
[02:25:00]  on nine years.  Why?  Nine years?  Yeah.  It's only been with Jess.  Oh.  You've been married.  It's true.  Huh?  Oh no.  You've actually  got their number.  No.  There's no way  this can end well.  If we call  the 90 year old people.  That would be  terrible.  Hello?  Oh God.  We could be  we could be nice  as anything.  With our luck 
[02:25:30]  one of them  would drop dead  on the phone  and shock jocks  kill beloved  Swiffer couple.  Yeah.  Well we convinced  them to play  cherry darts  and ruin their marriage.  Why are you always  putting up with that  shit from her?  Marty I'm bending  over now.  You have the whipped  cream on the cherry?  No he  misunderstands  he has a tomato  and he  fucking hits her  in the asshole  and her head  goes forward  and she  fucking  bangs on the  fucking wall 
[02:26:00]  and dies.  He's a giant  fucking  or it's a belt  like a hot  red pepper  gets stuck  in her ass.  Her asshole  hurts.  Jalapeno.  What a crummy  ending to the story  that would be.  Really?  Fucking  Lee winds up  and buries it.  She has to have  fucking  medical grade  ointment  fucking  Swiffered  into her anus  to fucking  You guys  would really  be mucking  things up 
[02:26:30]  for Swiffer.  Oh yeah.  Because that  fucking pepper  got stuck in there  and she panicked  and he panicked  trying to get it out  and he just  mushed it in further.  Old hands.  Poor Lee.  Lee's got a big  hot pepper  up her ass.  Yeah and she  cracked her teeth  against the  base of the  stone  when she leaned  forward.  She's screaming  to Morty  that it burns  it burns  so he's squirting  the Swiffer mop  thing into her  asshole 
[02:27:00]  when the ambulance  gets there.  He's accidentally  loaded it  with kerosene.  How could he  make that  mistake?  He's old.  Why would he  do that?  I don't know  why do they  back up through  the fucking  garage door?  They're fucking  old.  He shouldn't  have kerosene  in his house.  Holy shit.  Oh my god  Jimmy.  Eric tried to  call them but  don't call them  for what?  So we could  talk to the  hot couple 
[02:27:30]  that is really  in the news  a lot right now.  But he says  that it went  to a machine  and he's  quick to point  out not  voicemail  an actual  answering machine.  Oh one of  those.  Oh they're  nice people.  Yeah what  are you gonna  do?  I thought you  guys I'm just  trying to produce  it.  Yeah.  Oh and  that's how  you.  Yes it's the  old couple  from the  Swiffer  commercials.  That's how  you executive  Marty and  Laverne.  Hey shit. 
[02:28:00]  All right.  No good for  them.  We'll take a  break and  Shedep.  Yes and we'll  Shedep and  we'll April  Fars.  April Fars.  I'm on  Twitter.  Oh you are?  You want to  give out your  Twitter address?  Edgar  Mellencamp.  Edgar  Mellencamp.  That's my  name.  And what  can people  expect from  a Twitter  from Edgar  Mellencamp?  Lots of  things. 
[02:28:30]  Fun?  Ew.  His mouth  looks like  an asshole.  Like what?  I sent  a tweet  to the  president.  Oh you  did?  Yes I  did.  What did  you write  in there?  I'm the  president of  Syria.  Apple  Fars. 
[02:29:00]  Take it.  After these  messages.  The Opie and  Anthony Show.  We'll be right  back.  Sirius XM.  And now  the Opie and  Anthony Show.  What a catchy  tune.  Mamie Beardsley.  Eat my  ass.  Mamie Beardsley.  Was Howard in 
[02:29:30]  today?  Was that  what they were  talking about?  Because I read  something that  Robin Quivers  announced that  she had cancer  for the past  year.  Yeah I guess  they were  talking about  how she's  been not in  the studio  for like a  year.  Yeah.  I guess  that's why.  Everyone knew  around here  right?  I think so.  Yeah.  I mean why  else do you  stay home for  a year?  Because it  would be  wonderful.  Well not  the cancer  part.  But just to  be like hey  I'm not  coming in.  Yeah. 
[02:30:00]  You have a  studio.  It's all  set and  ready to  go.  I know  right?  I would  be the  trouble with  me though I  would be  in bed  upstairs and  I'd be  thinking I  gotta go all  the way down  to the  basement.  Ah god I  gotta trudge  all the way  downstairs.  Would you  guys mind if  I did this on  the phone?  Maybe I'll  just do a  phoner.  Or you'd  start sleeping  in the  studio.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So I  gather  because I  just saw  it on  TMZ  that  was this 
[02:30:30]  just this  morning she  was talking  about this?  And how it  said he  thought she  was a  goner?  Jesus.  That's the  quote.  That's  fucking  pretty  intense.  But she's  apparently  she went  through  chemotherapy  and everything  and is  cancer free.  Terrific.  That's kind  of nice.  Yeah.  That's good  to hear.  She's a  good I  like her.  She's  always been  very nice.  Yeah.  So I  wish Robin  Quivers all  the best.  While we're  talking about  wonderful people  would you like 
[02:31:00]  to talk to  Bill Burr on  the telephone?  Oh that's  a good seg.  Like that.  Bill Burr!  Hello everybody.  How you  doing Billy?  Oh the  summer wind  came  blowing in  from across  the sea.  I  missed you  last night  on Breaking  Bad.  I didn't  see you.  I was  like uh  oh.  Uh  oh.  What  happened?  But they  referred to 
[02:31:30]  me.  They did  refer to  you.  Got a  little of  his  backstory.  A  little  backstory  right?  That  was pretty  exciting.  That  was.  I  didn't  know  that  that  was  going  to  happen.  So I  don't  you know  all I  know  is  the  scenes  I  did.  Oh so  you didn't  know that  that was  going to  end like  that.  No spoilers  of course  but you  didn't know  that that  ending was  coming up  last night.  No no.  What it  is they  just give  you the  scenes that  you're  doing so  that when  you go  to do  the  scenes  there's  a little  bit of  dialogue 
[02:32:00]  that kind  of tips  you off  like what  happened  right before  or after  but for  the most  part  I'm in  the dark.  But you  you're not  done yet.  There's three  more episodes  right?  Are you in  any of the  three?  All I  can tell  you is  that my  character  is currently  searching for  Jesse.  Son of a  bitch.  I try to  get a tidbit  or two.  He told you  last time  that he  wasn't in  it again  and then  he shows  up.  Yeah you  said like  I don't  think I'm  in it anymore 
[02:32:30]  and then  it's like  oh my  god it's  a fucking  huge part  of the  episode.  How insane.  I mean I  don't want to  ruin it because  you know  it's funny  the way people  watch TV  now is you  can talk  about an  episode like  two years  after it  aired and  then people  will write  you on  Twitter like  thanks a lot  for ruining  it dude.  and it's like  it came out  two years  ago.  At one point  it's the  statute of  limitations  over but  I understand  that there's 
[02:33:00]  you know  people getting  caught up so  but last  anyway last  night in a  vague way  I'll talk  about it  was just  unbelievable  on the road  was watching  it with  literally I  had my hand  over my  mouth  watching it  and then by  the end of  the episode  I was  standing up  yeah  exactly  no no no  no  yeah yeah  I was just  the second  it fades  and you see  one of the  credits come up  I'm like  oh you gotta  be shitting me 
[02:33:30]  I didn't know  you know  because I  didn't know  how much  time was  left in the  episode  I said  that with  10 minutes  left  I literally  said  if you  motherfuckers  ended on  this  that's what  I said  and then I  started fast  forwarding to  the commercial  I said  oh good  good  there's 10  minutes left  there's 10  minutes left  yeah yeah  unbelievable  show  yeah it's  it really  is  and it's  just built  up ahead of  steam over  the years  that it's  been on 
[02:34:00]  you know  it's not  one of  these that  started out  big and  it's  ending with  kind of  this you  know  alright well  thank god  it's over  and kind of  petering out  it went the  other way  like people  started getting  into it  after it was  already on  and they  caught up  on episode  and now  it's ending  like huge  like everyone's  fucking watching  this  yeah  characters  didn't have  to get  married  and have  a kid  you know  like  that's like  the Oliver  moment on  the Brady  bunch  yeah yeah  bring in  some stupid  snarky  kid  yeah they 
[02:34:30]  got to  bring in  or they  yeah they  adopt some  kids and  try to get  back to the  early episodes  where the  original kids  were young  but now  they're in  college  getting ready  for the  journey  love  chachi  yes  where are you  LA  yeah I'm in  Los Angeles  I'm in the  middle of  doing a radio  tour thing  here and this  is the 15  minute bathroom  break and I  didn't have to  take a piss  so I said  hey  why don't I 
[02:35:00]  call my  friends out  there in  the fucking  summer wind  summer wind  yeah yeah  what do you  got going  on  oh I  got nothing  going on I  watched a lot  of NFL  football yesterday  yeah what'd  you think  I mean I  I don't know  I am you know  everybody knows  for the most part  it was to the  shop Massachusetts  and watching the  Patriots was  really interesting  yeah  as far as  watching us  our offense is 
[02:35:30]  just so different  now considering  Gronkowski's hurt  and then the  other one was  evidently a mass  murderer  so it's not a  lot of going to  tight ends  he's kind of  back to wide  receivers and  just it's gonna  be fun to  watch them  trying and  get on the  same page  it's a different  way to see  watch how great  Brady is  yeah  I'm not one of  those guys  where you know  I'm gonna sit  there and pout  because you  know we're not  gonna be like 
[02:36:00]  the Super Bowl  contender or  whatever I  mean I'm not  saying we're  gonna be bad  but as far as  like the Brady  Belichick thing  and Led Zeppelin  we're in like  the Nebworth  era  you know  Brady 34  35  we're starting  to get up  there  it is sad  when you had  a team that  it's just a  powerhouse dynasty  and then as  time goes on  you're like  oh you start  seeing it coming  apart like the  Yankees you know  you know did you  see my Cowboys 
[02:36:30]  last night Bill  that's why I  bleed Cowboy  blue  oh yeah  no they were  they look pretty  good actually  you know right  there was I  saw the  I saw the  second half  by the way  hello Jimmy  Norton  hi buddy  I was  I was  I was packing  up my  suitcases  listening  I have my  headphones on  I'm listening  to you  I walked in  like a minute  after you  started  no worries  yeah  obviously  big win  for the  Cowboys  I only saw  like the  second  half  but  you know  a Patriots fan  doesn't need  to  you know 
[02:37:00]  any more  information  of how  Eli can  bring a team  back  I wish  what happened  with the Cowboys  happened to the  Patriots  at least once  in those two  Super Bowls  I'll be honest  I didn't even  know they were  on Monday Night  Football  until I was  fucking at the  cellar or  something  I'm like oh  the Cowboys  are on TV  and I watched a  little when I  got home  yeah  I just like  annoying people  with my  temporary  fandom  I just don't  care  yeah you  don't care  until I'm  watching  when you're  watching  the emotion  comes back  and you get  all fucking  heated up  but  nah I don't 
[02:37:30]  give a fuck  week to week  anymore  speaking of  Monday Night  Football  I'm so annoyed  that there's  two games  tonight  it's like  I'm trying  to have a  life here  the NFL  they're ridiculous  it's Thursday  Sunday  all day  three games  and two games  Monday  and I watched  college football  it's like  you know  it's like a  junkie  it's like  I'm psyched  but also  I'm going  on a fender  here  why are there  two games  tonight  that's weird  I don't  because they're 
[02:38:00]  trying to make  more money  I have no  idea  absolutely  they're trying  to remind  people that  NFL football  exists  I have no  idea  I don't know  how they're  doing this  it used to  be just  like Sunday  and then  the Monday  night games  was like  the little  special thing  you got  like hey  look at  this  and now  it just  seems like  are they  playing more  games  like  you just  no they  spread them  out  like  I liked  it back  in the day  when it was  everybody played  Sunday  and then you  had the  Monday  the one  Monday night  game  and now  they do 
[02:38:30]  that thing  where they  have the  random  Thursday night  game  and it's  only on the  NFL network  you know  so they're  trying to get  you to order  this  right  right  and that  NFL network  is only on  direct TV  I believe  it's still  that way  so  it's  kind of  cunty  yeah it  is  yeah yeah  because now  you gotta  kind of  put another  night  aside  to watch  football  what the  fuck  I know  and then  it would  be like  the Bengals  versus the  Dolphins 
[02:39:00]  you're like  why do I  give a shit  why would I  even watch  that  yeah  hey  I got a  question for  you Anthony  and Jimmy  I know that  you guys  you keep up  on the  world politics  did Syria  ever sign  anything that  said they  wouldn't gas  people  are they  in violation  of anything  and  even if you  sign it  did that  include your  own people  wasn't it  I wouldn't  use it  against other  people  if they're  your people 
[02:39:30]  it's kind  of like  that's your  stuff  right  right  right  brand new  clothes  and I  can roll  around in  the mud  if I  want to  you know  I  couldn't  agree  with you  more  I  think  I  don't  want to  see that  stuff  happen  but I'm  wondering  you know  that's a  horn  horn it's  nest over  there  man  why are you  going to  go over  there and  stick your  face in it  again  there's no  reason for  us to go  over there  and do  this  in this  humanitarian 
[02:40:00]  kind of  way that  they're  trying to  say  well  you know  you know  the subtext  of that  that's got  to be  either  you have  stuff in  the ground  we want  or we'd  like to  land our  planes there  so we can  take off  from there  and strategically  bomb somebody  who lives near you  kind of like how we  act like  Turkey's fine  because we can  land our  planes there  so we want to  like you know  kill a bunch of  people  because they  don't like the  new park  that they're  building  yeah  that's totally 
[02:40:30]  fine  then we'll  leave you  alone  but  yes  Syria  I don't  know  I think  there's  some type  of  thing  that they  came up  with  after World  War I  that said  oh boy  chemical weapons  and mustard  gas  and things  like that  you're not  supposed to  use them  but  that was  the first  one  and then  there was  another  one  in 1949  after World  War II  was there  yeah  because  Japan  used some  and China  and there was  a couple  other things 
[02:41:00]  but  you got the  other thing  like yeah  no chemical  weapons  but firebombing  that was okay  yeah  strafing  you know  and don't  forget  you know  the country  and shooting  farmers  that's what  they called  strafing  and let's  not forget  our  two atomic  bombs  you know  yeah  well you know  what were we  that's one  of those  things  so I just  read this  book called  Fly Boys  which sounds  like it's  about a  boy band  but I swear  to god  it's about  World War II 
[02:41:30]  pilots  yeah  like  they  they were  victims of  they had a  maniac  getting power  and he got  them all  to drink  the Kool-Aid  that you  had to  you just  weren't going  to surrender  you had to  kill yourself  and that  Americans  bled green  blood  and we had  tails  and we were  going to  eat them  right  yeah  yeah  you ever  see that  footage  on one  of those  islands  we  basically  you know  killed off  all the  Japanese  because they  did one of  those  bonsai charges  and just  ran right 
[02:42:00]  into the  guns  they didn't  have guns  left half  of them  just had  sticks  yeah  so then  you're just  going up  to the  civilians  and as  we were  coming up  they were  literally  like  throwing  their  children  off a  cliff  yeah  they  were  fucking  jumping  off  of cliffs  and throwing  their kids  off the cliffs  onto the  rocks at the  bottom  and yeah  because they  had just  heard such  horrible  things about  I gotta tell  you you gotta  read that  book Flyboys  there's a  chapter in  there where  I had to  put it down  and walk  away  and come  back  yeah there 
[02:42:30]  was a little  bit of  cannibalism  going on  where you  know  eat the  enemy  and you  gain his  spirit  type of  thing  it was  really  yeah it  was about  these pilots  who got  shut down  and it  got declassified  like 10  years ago  so  you know  I'm a real  slow reader  so I just  got around  to that  chapter  is it hard  for you to  read books  it's harder  for me to  read books  I get too  distracted too  easily now  on the internet  or just doing  other things  or checking  twitter  it's really  hard to focus  my fucking 
[02:43:00]  brain on  just a full  chapter in  a book  I've always  had that  problem  I remember  I had  one of the  most embarrassing  moments of  my high school  debacle  was I was  reading a book  for a book  report and  everyone was  you know  everybody had  to pick one  and I was  complaining that  it took me  like three hours  to read  30 pages  because I  was I'm  one of those  guys when I  read it'll be  like you know  so you know  when I once  upon a time  so and so  was walking  down the  street and  then I'll  think like  oh I've 
[02:43:30]  walked down  the street  I was walking  down the  street but my  eyes are  continuing to  go left to  right reading  and I daydream  for like a  page and a  half and I  got shit I  gotta go back  and I did  that for like  three hours  so everybody  goes it took  you know when I  was at the  high school  cafeteria they  go it took  you three  hours to read  30 pages  and some  I don't know  why I said  this I was  trying to  defend myself  I go yeah  but I read  to understand  but I still  don't even know  what that means 
[02:44:00]  it means  it means it  takes you three  hours to  understand something  it doesn't  sound like you  helped yourself  there  yeah and one  of the highlights  of my podcast  is I get  the people laughing  at me when I  do the live  reads because I  sound like a  fifth grader  you know I  don't know I'm  a mess so  I've picked on  to read  the wrong version  of saying like  yeah I find it  very difficult to  read I  you read out loud  like Leroy in  fame  if I read stuff 
[02:44:30]  about like it's  gotta be something  intense like that  like you know  people getting  shot at while  flying planes  right now I'm  reading a book  by the guy from  ministry who I  actually met one  time on your  show Al  Juergenston and  Jesus Christ  Jesus Christ  just like the  thought you've  read all the  crazy things  rap stars  yeah yeah  this guy you  put the book  down another  way you know  you just like  he just blows 
[02:45:00]  your mind and  I'm only like  70 pages into  it it's great  what have you  been reading  it a week  I actually  I have been  you know Bill  I have a good  book you might  enjoy it's called  The Holy Bible  oh there you  go  you know that's  something I  tried to read  I tried to  read that on  the road but  it's just like  once it's ye  and all of  said it and  all that  fucking old  way of talking  yeah yeah  updated  yeah maybe  updated  dude leave  that hooker

[02:46:00]  I usually  just write  lol  and then we  stop talking  I hate  that I  think of  and look  at Bill  differently  now  because he's  in one of  my favorite  fucking shows  yes  because now  I'm looking  at him like  oh he's  the guy  in Breaking  Bad  and he's  more important  now than he  was  I hate  that  I don't  want Bill  to be like  does he have a  good point  in Breaking  Bad  it's a pretty  cool part  he makes the  most of his  part  it's not  big  it's not a  big part  but he's  good every 
[02:46:30]  time he's  on  and uh  yeah and  and it's  a cool  it's a cool  role  he's a  fucking  bad guy  you know  it's pretty  good  yeah  Billy  boy that  Breaking  Bad  we were  talking about  I gotta watch  it  we can't  we can't  even talk  about the  episode  don't worry  people we're  not spoilers  here  but um  is it really  that good  a show  oh it's  wonderful  Sam do you  watch it  I do but  I'm not  caught up  I'm uh  like they split  this season up  so I'm still 
[02:47:00]  on the first  half  it's on  Netflix  odd  but I was  on Twitter  last night  yeah  and like  all at once  at 10  50  or 10  55 or  something  it was just  tweet after  tweet  that didn't  say I  didn't get  it spoiled  but it  just said  holy shit  Breaking  Bad  oh my god  oh my god  it can't  end there  what am I  gonna do  it's uh  it really  is amazing  that you  you think 
[02:47:30]  uh  cause there  are certain  situations  like you see  Walter  and you'll  be like  okay he's  fucked  I mean he's  fucked  this  this is  this is  leading up  to the end  the last  episode  and okay  they just  fucked  and there's  no way  out of  this  than just  somehow  that's not  amazing  you know  it's amazing  the job  a mother  does  ew  you know  what  those are  your real  heroes  that's right 
[02:48:00]  heroes don't  wear capes  they wear  aprons  that's right  you wanna  watch  what's his  name  pretending  and running  around  I wanna  watch  a mother  feed that  child  oh  oh  god  what a  what a  fucking  what a  boring  drip  drip  what a  wet end  what a  downer  it's not  fun  did you hear  who got  arrested for  doing meth  in IRL  in real life  in real life 
[02:48:30]  IRL  who  Scott  Thorson  or Thornson  or what  Scott  Thorn  Scott Thorson  yep  yeah yeah  yeah  he got a  news  where is  it  news  if he  didn't  do  meth  who  it's  news  because  he's  in jail  for it  two days  ago  oh  yeah  he's back  in jail  he looked  like  he looked  like he was  quite  fucked up  yeah  I'm willing  to say  he was on  the drugs  when he was  here 
[02:49:00]  who's this  oh  she must  be  maybe  a  hits  one  intern  or maybe  they're  taking a  tour  they must  be  hits  one  fans  pretty  is it  bring your  daughter to  work  day  today  taking a  photo of  us  some guy  is taking  a photo  of us  I thought  she's very  I don't take  photos of  celebrities  you know who I  photograph  who  the average  guy working  at a job site  that's the guy  who deserves  his picture  taken  the guy  who's carrying  that lunch  pail  building a  house  for Mr.  Fancy  you left 
[02:49:30]  the show  to take  a photo  with Miley  Cyrus  oh  that is  true  you know  the hero  that wakes  up every  morning  and just  goes to  work  without  any  fanfare  absolutely  right  yeah  throw a  bunch  of  confetti  on me  I'm  here  with a  hard hat  you're  not one  of your  Hollywood  types  I'm glad  that you  guys have  come around  on the  Scott  Thorson  thing  to know  that there's  a probability  that he was  lying about  some of  the things  maybe some  of the stuff  but there's  enough in  there where  he was  fucking 
[02:50:00]  Liberace  in the ass  for this  big Scott  Thorson  dick  that he  probably  did  I think  he's full  of shit  on a lot  of points  there  I think  I think  they were  just fucking  each other  you know  I don't think  he was just  oh we would  kiss once  and that was  it  I'll bet  you there's  more though  because he  did get  the surgery  to look  like Lee  so there  was a  real  relationship  there  certainly  did  oh yeah  I think  there was  a real  relationship  I think  Liberace  was a weird  guy  but  I don't  think  he has  anything  to do  with  Michael  Jackson  I think  he's got  nothing  to do  with  Michael  Jackson  no  no  I think 
[02:50:30]  he's a liar  liar  I think  I believe  that was  a big  fib  yes  he fibbed  I think  so  I think  he fibbed  who knows  maybe Michael  wanted that  big fucking  dick  slapped against  his cheeks  I don't think  he did  gotta listen  to those  stories  they were  fun to  listen to  the stories  not for me  I want to  hear a story  about a guy  who got to  the job  at five  to nine  and left  at five  after five  he got  there early  and he left  late  of course 
[02:51:00]  we can't  have a  conversation  because this  idiot keeps  showing up  that's  yeah  we get it  you like  the working  man  regular  Joe  he wants  a container  of coffee  container coffee  and just  putting your  time on the  job  that's right  honest day's  work for an  honest day's  wage  they're not  heroes  they're gonna  get replaced  by robots  how can they  be heroes  oh god  how can a  robot not  swing a  hammer  yeah let a  robot hear  your whining  then we'll 
[02:51:30]  see  yeah  what  what  it doesn't  make any  sense  I think they  use robots  to make those  prefab houses  and they just  load them on a  truck and  fucking take  them to  site  his cam's  like a  fucking  offensive  lineman  look at how  he walks  go grab  fucking  Larry Allen  body  fucking  I feel  good  he's not  in good  shape  he's got  to get  healthier  so does  Roland  oh sorry  Bobby's at

[02:52:30]  hour  yeah yeah  but boy he's  got something  and not even  as a joke  yeah  anymore it's  just like  oh god  because you  know god  forbid something  happens  everyone sits  around going  oh maybe I  should have  said more  maybe I  should have  missed that  the other  thing  and uh  you keep  thinking well  with patrice  people like well  I should have  said something  yeah  but you know  it's like you  forget when you're  talking to guys  they don't have  to like you know  if you talk to  somebody about  addictive behavior  like bobby knows 
[02:53:00]  the right thing  right  but it's like  in your own mind  when someone's  telling you shit  you're listening  but you already  know  so if you tell  him like dude  he's like nah  dude I know  I'm doing this  thing now  and he'll be  telling you the  truth  in his own  mind  like you know  the same thing  with me  if I talk  about something  I'll know  the right answer  I'll know  how to talk  around it  so I'm being  respectful to  what you're  saying  but I'm also  yeah  you know  who are you  waving at  oh shit  Lauren's here  oh  I'm just walking

[03:12:30]  it on him a little  longer  I'm gonna leave  it on  wow  and then he's like  I was like  okay nice to  meet you  and he goes  is this  is this  went back to  the Bob Backlund  voice that Jim  likes his promo  voice  and he goes  is this your  lady here  I go yeah  this is my  wife Jess  and he goes  and he goes  oh  and then he  grabbed me by  the neck again  and grabbed  the back of  my arm  and he goes  she needs  a picture  she needs  to take a  picture  oh my god  what a nut  I'm going  like I may  not get out  of this alive  yeah  you think he's  choked a few  animals before  yeah  and then I 
[03:13:00]  started getting  tweets from  people that  like worked  with him  and somebody  tweeted me  and said that  they worked  with him  at like an  indie show  yeah  and his hotel  was five miles  away from the  venue where they  were wrestling  and Bob Backlund  insisted on  walking  to and from  the hotel  alright  oh by the  way  that  that twerking  video where  the girl  catches on fire  is so fake  just stop  sending it  to me  dude  if you  check this 
[03:13:30]  out  it's not  real  she gets  against the  door  starts doing  the upside  down twerk  against the  door  I guess  her roommate  or something  opens the  door  she falls  on a  table  that has  a candle  and an  open bottle  of booze  on it  and then  she comes  up and  her leg  is on  fire  and for  some reason  she's not  even  patting it  the video  stops  like who  shut it  off  the other  girl just  runs away  and then it  gets uploaded  and it gets 
[03:14:00]  uploaded  right  yeah  what happened  who stopped  the video  and people  get so upset  when you don't  respond  I sent you  a video  why aren't  you responding  to us  because it's  fake  people just  see things  now and  just assume  it's real  yes  look who's  out there  who's out  looks like  Tim Sabian  to me  oh yeah  you want to  hear something  funny  he came to  our office  and he goes  it was like  it's probably  1130 in the  morning  and he goes  hey so  are the boys  still around

[03:17:00]  and uh  we appreciate  this  Steve Spumante  after these  messages  the O.P. and Anthony  show  will be right  back  the O.P. and Anthony  show is available  later today  with Sirius XM  on demand  all right  you've heard about it  you've waited  four long  hours  for it  and now  the moment  you've waited  for rears  its ugly nose  head  after O.P. and Anthony  live  is coming up  next  this 
[03:17:30]  is  after O.P. and Anthony  live  here's your host  Sam Roberts  I like  Giovanni Ribisi  did you hear that  commercial that was  just on  unless you're listening  to the replay  it may not be on  during the replay  right  well  there's a commercial  for that Giovanni  Ribisi show  uh  I think Seth  McFarlane's creating it  the new sitcom  uh  on Fox 
[03:18:00]  I don't know  if the sitcom's  gonna be any good  at all  but  I do like  Giovanni Ribisi  Fox sitcoms  have been getting  better  have they  what's good  on Fox  uh  New Girl  New Girl's good  Mindy  Mindy's good  um  when they do  the other  like Glee  and all that  I know  people still love  that stuff  you a Glee fan  not at all  you like it a lot  no  the songs  or the  do you like  the songs  or the dialogue  I like the  hand movements  okay  you didn't really  fade that one  down today  did you  no just let it go  it's alright  you were distracted  yeah yeah 
[03:18:30]  yeah you're right  they have been  doing better  uh  I guess everybody's  trying to put out  new sitcoms  this season  cause you got  Fox who's got  this one  the Andy Samberg  cop  I think that's a sitcom  isn't it  Brooklyn Nine-Nine  that's a sitcom  right  I think so  yeah  I would hope  Andy Samberg's  not doing  something dramatic  just yet  give comedy a try  you could do it  uh  yeah there's  the Andy Samberg  cop sitcom  the Giovanni Ribisi  dad sitcom  NBC's got all  their new shows  Michael J Fox show  and uh  a whole bunch  of other ones 
[03:19:00]  cause they lost  The Office  and 30 Rock  but I guess  nobody's  I think I've been  the only one  who's been watching  NBC sitcoms  for quite some time  no I have too  maybe it's just  me and you  then you rock  because  I sit there  going oh my god  this Parks and Recreation  show is hilarious  it's the best  everybody needs  to be watching this  and then the ratings  come out  and nobody is  watching it  I don't think  they're watching  it on TV though  cause it's one of  the popular shows  on Hulu  I think they're  watching it online  that's doing them  no good at all  they're getting  pop up ads  or whatever  they bought into it 
[03:19:30]  NBC owns part of it  owns Hulu  they own a part of it  Hulu  them Fox  ABC  isn't it nice  when you can see  people working together  like that old couple  on the Swiffer commercial  everybody  just coming together  and working  for the greater good  I don't know  but it also  kind of depresses me  to see Giovanni Ribisi  doing that sitcom  cause he's not doing movies  yeah I feel like  he's a great actor  like Boiler Room  is like one of my  favorite movies  of all time  it's a great movie  great movie  do you feel bad 
[03:20:00]  that Robin Williams  is coming back to TV  no  no I don't feel bad  that Robin Williams  is coming back to TV  he's not like  you know  he's Robin Williams  he's gonna do fine  I don't think he has  a beard this time  but whatever  he's done  I don't know  Robin Williams never  he's done some good movies  I guess  but he never did  anything for me  specifically  you know  I mean  maybe I'm too  he was before my time  but  he never  he never did anything  I never liked him  more than I liked him  when I was a kid  and I was watching Aladdin 
[03:20:30]  and he was the genie  you know  I mean I guess I watched  Mork and Mindy reruns  when I was younger  I loved Popeye  yeah I liked Popeye  but I thought he looked weird  I remember being a little bit  freaked out  I was a Popeye fan  I was a fan of the character  when I was a kid  but I remember being  very freaked out  by what Robin Williams  looked like  as this human version  of Popeye  Popeye is one of those  cartoons that should  never be human  because he's got  his proportions  make no sense  why on earth  would a man have  forearms that size 
[03:21:00]  it looks like he's been  horribly stung  by many many bees  and he's got  terrible allergies  he eats spinach  and it's not his body  his forearms blow up  it's frightening  and then you got Bluto  who's obviously suffering  who's sitting there  and he's this  obese  to the point of  death really  eating away his sorrows  I don't know  there's a lot of  subtext in Popeye  but yeah  I was freaked out  by the Popeye 
[03:21:30]  live action movie  and Olive Oil  who's way too skinny  to be a real person  and so  what's her name  Shelley  Shelley Duvall  Shelley Duvall  freaked me out  Shelley Duvall  always freaked me out  though  in The Shining too  right  yeah  she looked like  a fucking maniac  but they said  Stanley Kubrick  used to drive her  nuts on the set  which is funny  because  like  he wanted her  to seem tortured  on film  so he would just  torture her  as a human being  he would make her 
[03:22:00]  experience  torturous  do you think  he kept calling her fat  no I don't think  he was doing  he wasn't bullying her  it's like really  you're eating that  yeah  do you think  we're shooting in 20 minutes  look craft services  is for everybody  Shelley  not just for you  okay  and she doesn't  eat anything  I just had some crackers  alright  well people are  enjoying soup  alright  and that's what  the crackers are for  the people enjoying  the soup  you're not supposed  to just go and  take as many packets  as you please  now anyway  Jack Nicholson  is going to swing  an axe at you  and you're supposed 
[03:22:30]  to look scared  and tortured  we're doing a good job  you're freaking  I don't know  whatever he was doing  he did it well  um  I guess it could be good  but I always  I always worry  when I see  and in 2013  it shouldn't be a worry  anymore  but I always worry  when I see  actors  who I enjoy  as like real  film actors  pop up  on TV shows  specifically sitcoms  because it's like  oh no  does this mean  things aren't going well  because I want things  to go well 
[03:23:00]  although I haven't seen  I don't remember  seeing Giovanni Ribisi  in much  after Boiler Room  he was in Ted  and he was hilarious  in Ted  I guess that's where  the Seth McFarlane  connection comes in  but beyond that  I don't remember  seeing him in much  in Ted  he was hilarious  he was dancing  and he had this  he just moved  what a creep  he was drinking soda  out of a straw  watching Tiffany's  I Think We're Alone Now  is that right?  was that what he was watching?  I believe so  some kind of music video 
[03:23:30]  and just  his  there's something  so disturbing  his feet  weren't moving  they were firmly planted  his torso  wasn't moving  but he was just  moving those hips  and moving those hips  and drinking his root beer  or whatever it was  out of a straw  it was really  hilarious and creepy  this  is after  Opie and Anthony Live  if you want to call in  866-WOW1-WOW  is the phone number  and you can contribute  in whatever way  you see fit  if you have a  what did you learn  if you want to talk about 
[03:24:00]  whatever it is  that we're talking about  or if you have a question  or whatever  feel free  I wanted to ask you  if you'd eat  a fake apple  made from fillers  and preservatives  you wouldn't right?  I don't think so  what about a meatball  that was made that way?  like most people  you want to be able  to pronounce  every ingredient  that goes into your food  if you cook at home  you use real  fresh ingredients  if you don't have time  to cook from scratch  Mama Mancini's Meatballs  is the answer for you  Mama Mancini's  starts with  100% 
[03:24:30]  USDA graded  domestic beef  for their meatballs  and all natural ingredients  like genuine  pecorino  romano cheese  onion  parsley  breadcrumbs  eggs  and a little  salt and pepper  real ingredients  just a little  salt Eric  not a lot  it's healthy  that's it  Mama Mancini's  famous  slow cooked  Italian sauce  is made just as  simply as their meatballs  they start with  whole Italian  plum tomatoes  crush them  and then add 
[03:25:00]  natural seasonings  Mama Mancini's  adds their meatballs  to the simmering  slow cooked sauce  for the perfect  combination of flavors  since 1921  Mama Mancini's  has never veered  from Grandma Mancini's  original recipe  real ingredients  just taste better  but you know that  by now  Mama Mancini's  slow cooked  Italian sauce  and meatballs  now available  at your  local supermarket  very very exciting  it was a very good  weekend for me  of course  Bob Kelly was in here 
[03:25:30]  on Friday  and we celebrated  my 30th birthday  together  I thank all of you  for calling in  and singing songs  and then telling  ghost stories  I was able to get  the ghost stories  out of my brain  because it would  have driven me nuts  but that was a fun show  we went out  a few of us  went out to dinner  we went to  Guy Fieri's restaurant  believe it or not  for my birthday dinner  which a lot of people  were a bit stunned by  on the Twitter machine  because they thought  I had this rivalry  with Guy Fieri  I don't have  a rivalry  with Guy Fieri 
[03:26:00]  anymore  if you recall  if you've gone  through the history  of what's gone on  Guy Fieri and I  I think are on good terms  you're just selling out  Sam  no I'm pretty sure  we're on good terms  because if you remember  our first encounter  after the incident  he did a show  this is how it all started  he did a show  for us  and he was cooking  and he thought  it would be a good prank  to squirt vodka  in my mouth  you probably know  this by now  I was offended by that  I don't drink 
[03:26:30]  but beyond that  and he knew  I didn't drink  by the way  he knew going in  he was like  oh this will be funny  because this kid  doesn't drink  but what happens  you know  you don't know why  and I'm not saying  there is a good reason why  but if you don't know  that there isn't  a good reason why  it's not something  you should be doing  to anybody  plus  who in your life  are you going to let  put things in your mouth  okay  maybe a perverted uncle  but beyond that  nobody  you don't want anybody  squirting  liquids  or putting food  in your mouth  that you don't want  that's offensive 
[03:27:00]  so you know  I let him know  that's not cool  and if you recall  E-Rock  I'm not selling out  he apologized to me  three times  and then  he came on the after show  he said the after show  was fun  I think  we're on good terms now  as far as I'm concerned  we are  did he come to your birthday?  he was in California  what the hell?  he opened his establishment  to me  I mean  he opened  Guy's American Grill  in Times Square  is basically his kitchen 
[03:27:30]  he opened up his kitchen  to me  and my loved ones  and E-Rock  and let us  come in  and experience that  what's wrong?  that was low  that was a low blow  I don't think so  that was  I was just  shot  I don't think so  but so that was a lot of fun  you know  we had a good time there  Saturday  had dinner with the parents  and I don't know  I was  Instagramming a couple  of the things I got  of course  Jess decided to give me  16 pairs of socks 
[03:28:00]  which are all fun  and the weird thing  about these colorful socks  that people are wearing now  is that they're very polarizing  and it's not all  one sided  like a lot of stuff is  I hate it  I hate it  I hate it  and you're reading the comments  hate that  hate that  and you come in  you know  especially when it's something  Opie Anthony and Jim  don't like  okay  I don't know if you've heard them  comment on my socks before  but I don't wear sneakers  so I gotta wear person socks  you don't wear shoes  and white socks  you don't wear tube socks 
[03:28:30]  with shoes  you just don't  you look like a fool  if you do  so  you know  and I don't want to just wear  you know  black gold tipped socks  so I wear socks  with a little color  a little splash  a little design  a little fun  so  and of course  Opie Anthony and Jim  completely hate it  because anything  that could bring somebody  joy in life  Opie Anthony and Jim  don't like that  so  Iraq am I wrong  no that's true  okay  so  Jess gave me all these socks  and I posted a picture 
[03:29:00]  I guess she said  she found a deal  that it was like  something ridiculous  like buy eight  get eight free  so she was just like  okay I'll take advantage of that  were they going out of business  no  I mean these  it's the big sock company  Happy Socks  Happy Socks  Happy Socks are a huge company  everybody's wearing these now  so  I go through my Twitter  and I don't know if it's based on age  I don't know if it's based on location  I don't know what it is  but you start scrolling down  and it's either people hate them  or people 
[03:29:30]  couldn't be more  couldn't praise them more  like there are people  who love these things  and that's what made me secure  they're like  yeah dude  try this brand  yeah  wear more pink  yeah dude  I'm like whoa  there's actually some positive things  I thought it was just going to be all negative  don't get me wrong  there were quite a few people  you know  chiming in  this is horrible  those are women's socks  making references to my sexual preference  which I thought was way out of line  you can't tell a man's sexual preference 
[03:30:00]  by the socks he wears  never  but there were  some people who didn't mind it  then  as I was saying  the weekend continues  I go to  my parents  house  and you know  we do cake  and that thing  on Saturday  and  E-Rock  did you look at my Instagram  over the weekend?  I saw your cake  did you see  I couldn't tell  it was very creepy  the cake  the cake gets the creepy award  yeah  I walked into the house  and my mom always makes me  chocolate cake 
[03:30:30]  with vanilla frosting  literally  she showed me a picture  from my first birthday  and the cake  was a chocolate cake  with vanilla icing  now  I think that that  tells you a lot  about how far back  my OCD  with food goes  and it definitely  tells you a lot  that my parents  did not do much  to try to stop it  okay  they were all on board  with me  just choosing  one thing  and going with it forever  no matter what  it does to me  so I get there  and there's the chocolate cake  with vanilla frosting 
[03:31:00]  but my mother  has made this  weird cake  kind of in the shape  of my head  but if my head  was like the shape  of that painting  the screamer  who's on the bridge  with his hands  on his cheeks  like Kevin McAllister  that dude  but she's added in  an afro  with brown frosting  it's on my Instagram  at not Sam  she's added in  an afro  with brown frosting  and the thickest  icing eyebrows  that you've ever seen  in your life 
[03:31:30]  it says happy birthday  across the front  instead of having a nose  and then just like  a weird like  scowl smirk thing  and I'm going  like this is weird  if anything  she should have  made the head bigger  and most of it  with the chocolate  icing on it  to look like your afro  that's what the  chocolate icing was  yeah but there's  not enough of that  there's too much face  and not enough hair  oh I see what you're saying  like it should have  switched it around  I guess because  there's so much  chin space on the thing  which is making me  very self conscious  if you look at it  the chin just keeps  extending  and I didn't realize 
[03:32:00]  I thought if anything  my chin was short  I don't think  I have a long chin  looking like the great Kali  yeah  it made me  look a couple times  in the mirror  but she goes  what do you want  do you want  a piece with hair  I was like  I don't even know  what I'm doing here anymore  that sounds delicious  yeah I'm surprised  she didn't take out  the Tupperware  of saved hair  that she has of mine  from the last time  I let my hair grow out  and she cut it at home  and saved it in a Tupperware 
[03:32:30]  I'm surprised  that she didn't take that hair  and just paste it  to the top of the cake  it was so weird  it was very weird  and I know that  it was a kind gesture  and I know that  a lot of people  would kill  to have a mother like that  but it was very strange  I felt the love  I was touched  not when I was a kid  I meant emotionally  I was touched  and I was happy  that it had happened  and that she had thought  of me to do that  but it was also  it really weirded me out  but then  and then of course 
[03:33:00]  I said no  I want a piece  with the eyebrow  I had to try  the eyebrow  and as I'm sitting there  eating my own eyebrow  made of icing  she starts giving me gifts  and I don't know  if you saw this  this is also on the Instagram  but my mom and dad  they went out  and I don't know  for me  I don't know if you think  it's weird or not  for me I thought it was  one of the greatest gifts  I've ever gotten  they made  Sam Roberts bobblehead dolls  who wouldn't want a bobble  especially if you got  an ego the size of mine  who wouldn't want  a bobblehead doll 
[03:33:30]  of themselves  like if I  didn't work in such  a toxic environment  where personal possessions  are destroyed  I would absolutely  not only  would I want that bobblehead  to be sitting on my desk  here at work  but I would bring it  into the studio with me  whatever studio I was in  whenever I was doing a show  if I'm doing O&A  it's going to sit right next  to that computer with me  if I'm doing the after show  it's coming over here  and it's getting into position  with me  I want that bobblehead  sitting in front of me  at all times  just so people know  oh this is a guy 
[03:34:00]  who must be important  he's got his own bobblehead  I asked  I don't think  that  there's any resale  possibilities  because they're special order  but also because  of a lack of customers  still  who has their own bobblehead  E-Rock  did you see the bobblehead  yeah I did  what did you think  looked better than the cake  and the bobblehead  is a perfect representation  of the Twitter icon  that I have  like that cartoony guy  it was amazing 
[03:34:30]  the part that  did me in  and the part that  I'm still feeling  today  is that then  Sunday morning came  and I woke up  and I did it Eric  I went back to the  boot camp workout  you remember last week  I was  week two  yeah  I couldn't not go  I don't like to quit things  especially when I throw up  while I'm doing them  Jess does this  my wife Jess  she does this boot camp workout  and it's not real boot camp  it's like the boot camp workout  that women go to 
[03:35:00]  like you might go  after you give birth  to try to shed some  pregnancy weight  it's all chicks  there's maybe like  two dudes  and me  which is just kind of  androgynous  and in the middle there  but last week  I went for the first time  and they meet  Sunday  at eight o'clock  in the morning  so I went last week  for the first time  and I vomited  I threw up  let me go to  Red Bear  what's up Red Bear  hey Sammy  every year  a chocolate cake 
[03:35:30]  with vanilla frosting  yeah  smell a rat dude  you're part mooly  why is that  I don't even understand  is that a black  that was unnecessary  what is that  do black people  like chocolate cake  well because it was  chocolate and vanilla  so he's saying  you're a mixture  on the inside  I guess so  that was a  terrible  terrible  well you went to it  I know  but it didn't say  that on the phone screen  where's Larry  when you need it  he could have  added in a slobo  and saved himself 
[03:36:00]  in my mind  let me go to  I'm going to try  one more time  Bruce in Louisiana  hi boys  I was calling  to see if I could  get one of those  Sam Roberts  bobbleheads  Bruce what makes  you want that  I'm a big fan  Sam  I love your show  I follow you  everywhere  and I can hardly  wait to have  that bobblehead  what do you want  to do with it  do I have to be  descriptive Sam  that head of bobbin  oh my god  well I mean  what do you want  to just like  put it on your desk 
[03:36:30]  or what  I've got an office  down here  you know  I'd love to display  it on there  and I get all  I mean  just the look  on that face  is wonderful  just go with it  or don't go with it  you know what I mean  I'm setting him up  for something here  he's doing the voice  god damn people  you can't even make  fun of me right  the problem was  I puked  at this boot camp  last week  and it was embarrassing  because like I said  it was all women  there was  you'd think 
[03:37:00]  a dude could go  handle it  and that's what was  going on in my mind  so I had to go back  there wasn't any choice  so I woke up  Jess woke me up  unless Jess didn't  want to go  if Jess didn't want to go  I was fine with that  because it was exhausting  so we end up going back  and I don't know  I think I've come  to the conclusion  women are a lot  stronger than men  maybe or  I don't know  if it's just me  but guys 
[03:37:30]  flop in that class  like I made it twice  and I'm feeling it today  like I can't get out  of this chair  once I'm in a chair  and I get out  it sounds like  did you hear the  tennis player  who cursed  this is exactly  how I feel  Stanislas Wawrinka  is that how you  pronounce his name  I don't know  he was his tennis player  and CBS aired  his press conference  and he's cramping up  in the press conference  so this is how  he started it  short time ago 
[03:38:00]  Stan Wawrinka  in the press room  he cramps up  oh fuck  smiles through it  and finishes  that's a good effort  did you hear that  I don't know why CBS  is just laughing  as this guy  is dropping F-bombs  on their network  oh yeah  he's exhausted  short time ago  Stan Wawrinka  in the press room  he cramps up  he's hurting  he's hurting 
[03:38:30]  okay  and I felt that  that's exactly  how I feel right now  once I get out  of a chair  I'm dead  my legs just  give up on me  it's horrible  I feel it  everywhere  and I shouldn't  because all these  girls that are  showing up to this  class are there  every single week  guys drop out  of this thing  like nothing  I don't know  if it's  because there's a lot  of jumping  and hopping  and squats  lots of squats  have you ever done  a boot camp workout 
[03:39:00]  E-Rock  really  you're asking me that  was that a silly  question  of course  and then  I think  Jess was just  trying to make  me feel better  but the instructor  is a dude  and he seems  to do alright  but they got  all these  like  on top of  all the jumping  and squatting  they have all  these different  types of pushups  that not only  do you have to  push up  but you have to  move your legs  like you have to  move your legs  from side to side  or you have to do  mountain climbers  in the middle  and at one point  Jess is doing  these exercises 
[03:39:30]  and the whole time  she's sitting there  going you're doing  great Sam  you're doing great  and I'm like  this is where  we're at  I'm supposed  to be the one  who's doing  a better job  and encouraging  Jess  who's struggling  and it's  the complete opposite  at one point  she asked  the instructor  now this is  the workout  this is easier  for women  than it is  for men  right  and the guy  goes  no not at all  I would never  say that  and I was like  dude  she was trying  to be nice  I'm struggling  over here 
[03:40:00]  will you give me  that  will you say  it's easier  for women  oh he doesn't  give a shit  just tell me  it's easier  for women  dude  how much  are you paying  for this  it's nothing  it's ten bucks  a class  it's not like  it's just some dude  who shows up  at a high school  track  and tells us  what to do  seems sketchy  I know  but he's got  his own t-shirt  so I figure  it's got to be  legit  does he  do the exercises  with you  or demonstrate  how to do them  he demonstrates  them  and he's in  pretty good shape  I trust him  and I'm always  hurting afterwards  I puked last week  so he's got to be 
[03:40:30]  doing something right  but he's just  some dude  that shows up  in his workout shorts  and he's on a  high school track field  and he's like  okay if you give me  ten dollars  I'll tell you  what exercises  to do for the  next hour  and then that's  what it is  you give him  a ten dollar bill  when you show up  and then that's it  it's a great business  wouldn't it be great  that you know  the school calls  the cops  because you're  trespassing  none of this  was sanctioned  I'm sure it's not  sanctioned  there's no students  there  it's all middle  aged women  well some of them  are younger  but men can't 
[03:41:00]  survive in this  class  and I don't know  if it's  this sort of  resistance  you know  squatting  push up  type of workout  and you know  doing dashes  you do the most  ridiculous things  you do crab walks  remember in like  second grade  when you used to do  crab walks  across the gym  and you do  or like  he calls them  bear walks  where you're crawling  and you're on all  fours except your feet  and your hands 
[03:41:30]  not your knees  and then you kind of  bend your knees  when you walk  and they look like  the type of thing  that a child  would have no problem  doing  but I don't know  if it's the repetition  or the order in which  this guy is making us  do these things in  your body just  wants to give way  there's no part of me  that wants to continue  let me go to  Brent in DC  what's up Brent  hey what's up guys  hey I was just  thinking Sam  you might have to  be a little more  descriptive to E-Rock  about what mountain  climbers and push ups 
[03:42:00]  are  thank you Brent  that's a good  push ups  do you know what  a push up is there  yes  you explained this  earlier  thanks for listening  to the show live  while it's going on  you do know  what a push up is  yes  alright well I just  wanted to make sure  I wasn't leaving you  in the dark  I know what all of this is  alright well you represent  I just choose not to do it  you know the good it can do  you just choose not to  I know the benefits  do you  does your wife  work out at all  she does  and when you guys  do you work out together  ever  no  I would say  yeah I would say  for you definitely 
[03:42:30]  very seldom if at all  um  when I do it  it's not together  why not  just because  we don't want to be  around each other  when that's happening  why  you don't go to  fun spot together  you don't work out together  you went to  Obie's Beach House  together right  yes  do you like each other  yes of course we do  you do  yes you just  certain things  we just don't do together  I like working out  with Jess  except it makes me feel  like  I think she might  enjoy it  we just haven't done it  but why don't you  want to work out with her  because you don't want  her to see you 
[03:43:00]  looking like a fool  no I would work out  with her  we used to go to the gym  you just said  you don't like to do that  together  not I don't like to  well right now  she doesn't  why not  because she wants to go  and do her thing  because you're not  up to standards with her  probably  like she's on a certain  level  and you're just not  there yet  she goes and uses  the machines  and takes a walk  and you're sitting there  going  what are you taking  a walk  she keeps trying  to buy me a bike  what are you not  and you won't have it  bikes are easy 
[03:43:30]  I'm sure they are  I mean the first  couple rides are tough  but then it gets easy  do you think she's  strong  bikes are expensive too  you got it dude  what's expensive to you  I don't want to spend  like you know  near a grand for a bike  a grand  why would you spend  a thousand dollars  for a bike  get like a bike  for a couple hundred bucks  you're only going to  use it four times  to get a pre-made  Schwinn from Toys R Us  you're only going to  use the bike  three times  before you get rid of it  exactly  waste of money  so just spend  a couple hundred bucks  on a shitty bike  no  save a couple hundred bucks  for what  pizza  pay-per-view 
[03:44:00]  yeah that's  exactly right  do you think your wife's  stronger than you  no  why not  she's not  then how does she do  better in the gym  than you  you can look better  and not be stronger  no do better  like she works out better  she's saying that  you're not up to speed  with her  she does it more  than I do  so she's probably  stronger than you  right now  no I don't think  she's stronger  she has more  endurance for it  who would do better  at boot camp  probably her  okay well that's  like strength  and conditioning  all right 
[03:44:30]  but we're not  doing boot camp  she's just doing  basic exercises  okay but you just  said she would do  better than you  at the boot camp  probably  so she has better  strength and conditioning  than you  she's not stronger  than me  oh my god  you see what I'm  saying right Sal  the Nagel logic  yeah  she's not stronger  isn't it amazing  like he sticks  on to this point  it's just like a girl  like when you argue  with a girl  yeah  who doesn't like  who when she talks  to you  she just wants you  to hear her problems  yeah 
[03:45:00]  and then you give her  the solution  and then she goes  no  no  and then she repeats  the problem  and you go okay  I just solved it  and she goes why  are you yelling at me  and you go because  you're being frustrating  I've dealt with this  before  because I'm a problem  solver  okay  I look at a problem  and I solve it  and if somebody presents  logic to me  that defeats  something that I  had previously said  I will say to myself  oh  maybe I was incorrect  in my initial statement  that logic makes sense  Iraq on the other hand 
[03:45:30]  will do the same thing  that a girl does  when they're arguing  or when they're presenting  a problem  and they don't want  to hear the solution  because it's not my problem  which is  Iraq will present  a statement  he will hear logic  that counters  the statement  he just makes  and instead of  acknowledging that  he would just latch  on to the original  statement still  Iraq is a  unique human being  he's an enigma  wrapped in a riddle  I'm a man of principle  does it make sense  I don't know about  my own principle  yeah I think 
[03:46:00]  I think you're a man  who just  you have social disorders  and you latch on  to whatever statement  you make  I am what I am  yeah alright  I had this  back to Popeye  yeah I love it  I had this vision  of Eric  when you guys  were talking  about him  riding a bike  that like  he would be  on the bike  and the bike  just collapsed  and the tires  would blow out  how dare you  he'd have to buy  like an adult  size like  big wheel  and I could just  see Eric  like riding  like totally  like yeah  I'm doing exercise  funny you bring  that up  Sal  why you bought 
[03:46:30]  one  because Roland  showed me  a website  where you can  buy adult  size big wheels  I don't know  what you guys  do in your free  time  I don't want  to know  either  Jay in Minnesota  I'm still  buying one  I know  I could see you  Eric tell him  to pick up  the hotline  I got to sit  on the interns  today  Jay in Minnesota  Sam  super duper  what's up buddy  you were talking  about  the men  keep dropping  out of this  boot camp  workout  you realize  that men  go to boot  camp  it's not aimed  at women 
[03:47:00]  man  you just  have a hard  time  because you're  starting  do you think  that men  have a tougher  time  do you think  men have a  tougher time  realizing that  I'm just  starting and  I'll get  better at  this  because  these  dudes  drop out  of this  class  and the  women are  not  dropping  out  women are  not  physically  stronger  but I  don't think  that there's  any  their mental  endurance  is higher  so you think  the women  are kind  of like  I'll just  hang in  here until  I'm used  to this  where the  men are  like fuck 
[03:47:30]  that  that is  difficult  yeah  I think  that's it  absolutely  they have  just  have a  minute  where  they're  going to  touch  for something  they want  I mean  you have  wives  they're  toughing  it out  for something  they want  yeah  that makes  sense  thank you  Jay  your phone's  starting to  crap out  but you  make a good  point  maybe if I  hang in  on this  thing a  little bit  I will  be physically  stronger  than my  wife  which would  be a great  goal for  anybody  very special  guest on  the hotline  Club Soda  Kenny  hey  Sam  happy 
[03:48:00]  birthday  it was  Friday  we went  over that  already  I think  alright  yeah  I'm  chewing gum  right now  okay  well I mean  you could spit  it out  and make it  sound a little  bit more  clear  but  either way  but I  I wanted  to  I wanted  to discuss  something  with you  what was  that  wasn't there  a physical  fitness  challenge  on the  Opie and  Anthony  show  yes  and who  were the  contestants  me  Eric  and Bobo  and who 
[03:48:30]  was the  winner  Eric  was  enough  said  well  okay  that doesn't  really  that doesn't  go to the  point of what  we're talking  about  Eric's wife  was not  a contestant  so that's  more of the  point  also  there's still  contention  over that  because the  push-up  competition  was controversial  I will  and Bobo  definitely  didn't win  although  he did  sit-ups  I mean  Eric  you gotta  give Bobo  credit for  those sit-ups  he was just  I don't know  I mean  when you talk  about retard  strength  apparently  it's in  the abdominals  because he 
[03:49:00]  just did  a hundred  of them  just sitting  there  I think  it was  just  because  he always  tried  to suck  his own  dick  maybe  that's  what it  was  but  the key  to that  physical  challenge  was the  running  part  because  I ran  faster than  Eric  because  I'm not  a bad  runner  and  I wasn't  going to  bring that  up  but  I ran  around  the block  faster than  Eric  Eric  came in  second  and Bobo  got lost  Bobo  got lost  running around  the block  so that's  how he was  unfortunately  for Bobo  came in 
[03:49:30]  third  yeah but  Eric was  the winner  yeah  Eric's  a winner  why  I didn't  say Eric's  not a  winner  thank you  Kenny  I don't  think  that  Eric  are you  taking  that  logic  to  your  point  I  will  add  that  to  it  yes  Kenny's  coming by  Nagle  logic  but  Kenny  do you  understand  what I'm  saying  that  Eric  said  that  he  believes  that  at  a  boot  camp  workout  his  wife  would  outperform  him  the  same  way  my  wife  outperforms  me  which  goes  to  say  that  my 
[03:50:00]  wife  has  more  strength  and  conditioning  than  I  do  and  Eric's  wife  hypothetically  has more  strength and  conditioning  than he  does  no  you're  wording  it  wrong  Sam  you should  have  endurance  and  conditioning  not  strength  that's what  I said  but it  takes  strength  to do  the  exercise  I mean  when you're  talking about  doing push-ups  and doing  squats  and all that  stuff  that's  strength  that's  muscle  it's  not  endurance  no  all  of a  sudden  you're  like  into  phys ed  you don't 
[03:50:30]  know  about  the  body  okay  you see  that  that  would  be  me  presenting  this  is  the  same  Nagel  club  so  can't  string  of  logic  where  I  present  something  and  then  you  try  to  just  come  up  with  something  no  no  we're  not  trying  to  come  up  with  something  isn't  it  funny  that  you're  the  only  one  that  thinks  differently  things  differently  I  think  it's  you  and  Eric  and  I  believe  that  I  know  for a  fact  that  you  don't  like  it  when  people  pick  on  Eric 
[03:51:00]  so  you  are  huh  Sal  has no  credibility  because  all he has  is pussy  on his  mind  Sal  you  thinking  about  pussy  again  did  you  come  Sal  did  you  come  into  my  show  thinking  about  pussy  yes  I  need  you  focus  Sal  I  need  you  focus  on  the  task  at  hand  and  not  to  walk  around  here  like  it's  a  pussy  convention  oh  my  god  that's  all he  cares  about  he has  no  credibility  if it 
[03:51:30]  comes to  pussy  ask him  anything  else  leave him  out of  it  Sal  is now  a pussy  expert  yeah  see this  is making  me think  clubs  county  this is  making me  think  that you're  simply  a contrarian  I  don't know  what that  means  it means  you're  somebody  who likes  to take  whatever  the popular  opinion  is  and argue  it  I  disagree  alright  well  it's  fact  what is  that 
[03:52:00]  Eric's  the  winner  ok  Eric's  the  winner  you win  Eric  congratulations  on being  a winner  yay  it's  what we  learned  today  it was  your  birthday  I didn't  get  invited  Eric's  the  winner  and  Sal  loves  pussy  ok  we did  we learned  all of  it  alright  alright  have a  nice  day  anyway  ok  thank  you  why  didn't  you  invite  Kenny  to  the  birthday  when  am I  going to  invite  him  to  birthday  he  brought  it up  he told  me  in the  hoist  Sam  didn't  invite  me  I was  like  oh shit  I don't  want to  get  involved  with  this  Kenny's 
[03:52:30]  a fucking  adult  he really  shouldn't  care  about  whether  somebody  invites  him  to  a  birthday  party  when  was  the  time  Kenny  invited  me  to  a  family  celebration  I don't  know  none  and you  know what  the last  time I  invited  Kenny  to  something  personal  it was  my  wedding  and he  was the  only  person  at the  whole  wedding  that was  making  wise ass  comments  the whole  time  didn't he 
[03:53:00]  make jokes  during the  ceremony  yes  that's  pretty  funny  though  he  made  jokes  during  the  ceremony  everybody  was  getting  emotional  as  Jess  and me  were  reading  our  own  vows  and  Kenny  was  making  little  wise  ass  comments  to  people  next  to  him  because  he  can't  because  he  doesn't  feel  comfortable  with  his  own  emotions  he  can't  just  be  in  the  moment  I  think  at one  time  he  said  speak  up  all right  so  then  why  would  I  ever  invite  him  to  anything  why  I  think  he's  back  on  the  phone  I'll  go  right  to  him  you  can  tell  I'm  just  put  him  on  hold  I  see  his  number  club 
[03:53:30]  soda  all right  that's  I  take  it  back  you're  right  we  had  a  wonderful  time  when  we  were  in  Cleveland  doing  the  live  show  Kenny  and I  we  left  Eric  and  Roland  and  Troy  at  the  strip  club  and  we  went  to  the  hotel  bar  and  club  soda  county  taught  me  a  great  trick  which  is  you  go  to  the  gift  shop  and  you  buy  a  bottle  of  Dr.  Pepper  where  it's  considerably  cheaper 
[03:54:00]  than  lady  for  a  glass  of  ice  which  is  free  and  then  you  take  the  bottle  out  and  pour  it  in  and  then  we  had  a  great  time  yeah  yeah  we  did  have  a  good  time  at  everybody  else's  expense  yeah  see  so  I  invited  you  but  then  after  that  I  invited  you  to  my  wedding  where  you  and  Steven  yeah  I  gave  you  a  great  gift  what  was  it  it  was  a  lot  of  money  that  was  fantastic  I  really  appreciate 
[03:54:30]  that  I  think  we  sent  you  a  thank  you  note  did  we  not  well  I'm  not  going to  spend  your  gift  on  a  thank  you  note  what  like  a  nice  little  gesture  in  return  you  don't  give  a  gift  in  no  you  don't  give  somebody  a  gift  because  they  got  you  a  gift  that's  my  wedding  I'm  supposed  to  put  that  money  towards  starting  a  who 
[03:55:00]  was  worse  than  you  who  was  better  than  me  it  depends  on  perspective  Kenny  it  depends  on  perspective  but  as  far  as  I  can  see  I  mean  you  weren't  that  bad  because  you  weren't  a  disturbance  until  after  the  fact  like  you  didn't  when  I  was  at  the  wedding  itself  I  didn't  know  what  you  were  doing  you  weren't  that  bad  but  everybody  else  was  wonderful  and  you  were  like  not  great  no  no  everybody  else  was  mediocre  and  I  was  terrific  take  a 
[03:55:30]  vote  I  bet  you  would  lose  who  am I  going to  who am I  going to  take the  vote  among  ask  Troy  I'm not  going to  ask Troy  because  we won't  be talking  about his  name  on this  show  again  and I'm  not going  to ask  Eric  because  you  already  agreed  with him  today  ask  Roland  I  gotta  go  Kenny  I'll  ask  how about  how about  I ask  my  family  and  loved  ones  alright  well you  have a good  day anyway  okay  oh 
[03:56:00]  thanks  okay  bye  bye  do you  think he's  upset  yeah  he's gonna  carry that  with him  all day  it's the  first thing  tomorrow  morning  uh  Brad  in  West  Virginia  it's good  to have  people to  sing out  for you  though  Eric  that's  gotta  feel  good  what's  up  Brad  happy  related  birthday  thank  you  question  when you  go to  these  boot  campaigns  do you  think  if this  is your  first week  and there's  people who  have been  doing it  for months  are you 
[03:56:30]  expected to  operate at  the same  level  yeah  that's  bullshit  because  I can't  I cannot  do it  yeah  very good  very good  a little more  confidence next  time  a little more  guts in it  you know  what I mean  uh  Mike in  Brooklyn  hey  what's up  what's up  buddy  um  are you on  a topic  before of  uh  endurance  there is a  difference  between  muscular  endurance  and  cardiovascular  endurance  like  that of  a runner  and that of  like a wrestler  or someone 
[03:57:00]  plays judo  where you're using  your muscles  all the time  as opposed to  a runner  so  right  just wanted to  make that  distinction  I'm talking  about muscular  endurance  a little bit  of running  but using  your muscles  and I think  Eric's wife's  muscles  are stronger  than his  the same way  my wife's  muscles are  stronger than  mine  it's not  something to be  ashamed of  it's something to  take pride in  quite frankly  you have a  physically fit  wife  there's a lot  worse things  you can have  in this world  Eric would you  rather be fat  or would you  rather your  wife be fat  I would rather  be fat 
[03:57:30]  than her be fat  every day  right  all day long  so that's  what I'm saying  it's not an  insult  uh  alright  oh  do we have  a couple  minutes  you have  uh  two and a half  great  snowy  Samuel how are you  doing today sir  good buddy  I gotta stick up  for E-Rock  a little bit  and the only reason  Sal's on your side  is because  any chance he has  to get on Eric  he's gonna be  on your side  because you're  against Eric  that's a great  point  that's a great  I mean  plus Opie's not  here  you mean so Sal's  gonna try to open  his mouth  because he can  that's why he comes  on the show  yeah 
[03:58:00]  Sal's the guy  that keeps putting  all the E-Rock  songs in the Nuggets  so what do you  think he's gonna  who's trying to do  well hold on  hold on  I don't want to  stick up for Sal  but it's usually  not Sal's decision  on what's showing  up on the Nugget  I don't know  anything about that  it's somebody  sitting in that  seat over there  but I just try  to entertain people  but  Sam  yeah  yeah go ahead  oh I'm sorry man  but there is a  difference between  like physical strength  and endurance  I mean he's more  endurance and probably  could last longer 
[03:58:30]  if they got those  knock down drag out  fights  E-Rock and most men  got more mass  than their women  they're physically  stronger groups  forces more than  most women  I mean I'm not  thinking every woman  I mean  yeah I'm thinking  about like  I'm not talking  about who would  win in a fight  like I think Eric  would probably  hit his wife  harder than his  wife could hit him  do you think  that's true Eric  I don't want to  find out  but  theoretically  it goes back  it goes back  she's probably  obviously  but  that doesn't  mean make you 
[03:59:00]  stronger physically  I mean  strength is like  kind of a mass  too behind it  doesn't it  maybe but Snowy  I gotta let you go  because we gotta go  but I think Snowy  is probably also  a bigger guy  who wants to believe  that just because  he's a bigger guy  it means he's  stronger than his  wife  but it  I understand  what he's saying  and he understands  what I'm saying  I could do things  she can't  but I can't  like outrun her  what can you do  that she can't  I can lift stuff  I can open stuff  you can lift more  than she can  oh yeah  how much more  a lot 
[03:59:30]  oh Jesus  who farted  that was Pepper  oh Pepper  it's great to hear you  again buddy  it's great to hear you  he said it's great  to hear you  he's nodding  he's not feeling good  he's alright  he sounded good  yeah  he sounded beautiful  is that the  Lysol spray  no this one is  Glade  oh  Ron and Fez are  coming up next  so stay tuned for that  and there'll be more  of this tomorrow  also the new  Twitter accounts  are up on the  Facebook for  Opie and Anthony  Facebook.com  slash Opie and Anthony  what new Twitter accounts
