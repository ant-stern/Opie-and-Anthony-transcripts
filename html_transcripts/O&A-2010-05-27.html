<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with the hosts self-deprecatingly referencing past controversies and expressing disdain for radio. They immediately launched into a discussion of Simona Halep's breast reduction surgery, using their previously coined nickname "the tit monster" and focusing heavily on the visual changes.  This transitioned into outrage over a news report about the murder of a 16-year-old girl, criticizing the vague description of the suspect and the lack of racial details, further sparking commentary on race and reparations for slavery.  The hosts then reacted to a viral video of a two-year-old smoking, expressing disbelief at its removal from YouTube and speculating on the child's circumstances.  A brief mention of the BP oil spill, punctuated with the phrase "plug that hole," preceded a lengthy segment on the American Idol finale.

Their American Idol recap included commentary on the chaotic nature of the event, specifically focusing on the performances of Alice Cooper, Michael McDonald, Chicago, Joe Cocker, Paula Abdul, and Janet Jackson (whose voice they compared to Michael Jackson's).  A major point of discussion was a confrontation between Dane Cook and contestant Bernardo, resulting in the show cutting away from the live performance.  Bret Michaels' appearance, despite his health issues, was also noted.  The hosts then discussed a vintage Popular Mechanics magazine from the 1950s, examining its futuristic technology articles, advertisements, and the societal norms reflected therein.  A caller provided context on "remailing" services advertised within, linking them to early Ponzi schemes.  Throughout this portion, the hosts used profanity liberally and made numerous sexually suggestive and offensive comments.

The following segment continued the extensive coverage of the American Idol finale, analyzing Lee DeWyze's win and delving into his ethnicity and background.  They heavily critiqued Chicago's performance, focusing on the age difference between the original and current members and the perceived decline in their vocal quality. This led to a listener-driven discussion about Chicago's history, marked by initial misidentification of a deceased band member and considerable confusion and comedic frustration,  followed by a more accurate exploration of Peter Cetera's contributions.  The hosts also mocked Paula Abdul's farewell speech, speculating about a possible illegitimate child with Simon Cowell, and briefly addressed Simon Cowell's own farewell speech.  A significant portion of this part of the show involved Anthony recounting his childhood memories of his parents' frequent and loud arguments, using highly offensive language to describe the situation and family members. He also shared a humorous anecdote about his delayed understanding of a childhood joke. No studio guests were explicitly mentioned in either segment, although several callers participated in the discussion about Chicago.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Opie and Anthony are no strangers to scandal.  Opie and Anthony on satellite radio.  Both hosts, Anthony Camilla and Greg Opie.  Not to be honest.  Opie and Anthony apologizing for yet another approach.  Comment profanity is left.  Is this the last straw for the watching Radio Zero?  Our show is stupid.  This is so irresponsible.  This should be illegal.  It really should be.  It's like, it's so unethical.  God, I hate fucking radio.  This could be the worst audio ever.  Shut up. 
[00:00:30]  Shut your fucking mouth.  This is terrible.  We just suck all around.  I hope you show restraint in fucking my girlfriend.  This stinks.  Fucking shut the fuck up.  We get it.  We get it.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's do it.  We got so much to talk about.  We've already talked about five or six different things before the mics even came on.  But yeah, I like doing that anyway, you know, just shooting the shit better to entertain 
[00:01:00]  ourselves than the listeners.  I say, well, we try it out on ourselves and then we hope the listeners buy into our horse  shit, our horse shit, our horse shit.  Well, we can start with the tit monster because it's a quickie.  It's a visual.  But a lot of people from lost the tit monster.  Yeah.  The tit monster.  Yeah.  They didn't wrap up that storyline either.  Ah, one of the many storylines.  They didn't wrap up on lost.  So I hear the people will be Googling the tit monster today. 
[00:01:30]  I don't know what her name is, but we've talked about her many times on our radio show.  It's a young tennis player who had, and I say who had, 34 double D breasts that were  getting in the way of her tennis.  Remember?  You remember her.  Oh, how could we forget?  We labeled her the tit monster.  Her name is Simona Halep.  H-A-L-E-P if you want to Google it.  And then we got word, I don't know, maybe six to eight months ago, that she was going 
[00:02:00]  to have breast reduction surgery.  Yeah.  And she did just that, and she is playing in the French Open, I guess.  I don't know if it's her first tournament back, but I guess her first major tournament  back.  And now she's down to a 34 C.  34 C.  She looks very, very small there.  Yeah.  And we had some great, great images of her with the 34 double Ds trying to hit the tennis 
[00:02:30]  ball.  Half the time, she's hitting her left boob.  Oh, I know.  Those giant tits.  But she had the breast reduction surgery.  It's your update, because we talked about her over the last year or so, and it's very,  very sad to see those big knockers gone.  Knockers bouncing all over the joint.  And she did it because of severe back pain.  Was it the back problems? 
[00:03:00]  Yeah, she had the back problems.  So now she runs around with her 34 Cs.  She should have just put on the bro.  I see.  The man's it.  I know that one.  But there you go.  There's your update on her.  And I tweeted the before and after picture if you want to check it out.  And I'm very, very depressed today, because some of the shots we got were terrific.  Big, natural, fucking heavy tits.  Look at them.  Look at those.  Look at that cleavage.  Well, she's leaning over, because I'm sure she just served the ball there. 
[00:03:30]  And her cleavage is almost hitting the tennis course.  After that serve, the weight of those tits must have just pulled her right down.  Oh, my God.  That's an action shot where she's reaching up to return a serve, it looks like, or maybe hit a serve.  But her tits have parted like the Red Sea.  Yeah, they don't hang either, man.  They're right up there.  They were sticking straight out. 
[00:04:00]  Yes, because I believe she's got youth on her side as well.  I think she's not that old.  She is.  Wow.  She figured she'd nip this problem in the bud before it got out of hand, before they really started Sagan.  Any other great shots of her?  I'm sure you guys could do this at home as well.  What about the ultimate?  Go down one in the search.  Yeah, where she's on her toes almost.  You could see kind of, yeah, let me see that one.  Yeah.  Let's look at them. 
[00:04:30]  I guess that must be after.  Is that an after shot?  She still has the nice A's.  You know something?  You know what?  She's all right with the 34 C's.  She is fucking fine.  Who's going to complain?  That's fine.  Jesus H.  Christ.  I mean, the shots beforehand were a little better.  So that's Simona Halep, H-A-L-E-P, if you want to check it out.  But she's back in the news because she's playing again with her reduced boobs.  And then we move on.  Wonderful.  We're just watching local TV here and a little tragedy.  Where was that?  Brooklyn?  The Bronx? 
[00:05:00]  Where was it at?  Do you know offhand?  I can't believe it was Brooklyn.  It was in Brooklyn.  A 16-year-old girl died last night.  Some guy killed her.  Six shots.  Yeah, a few shots fired.  But what did they say?  Slow rounds?  Slow.  Yeah.  Something like that.  Bang.  Bang.  Bang.  So obviously somebody wanted to take this girl out.  Just go white.  And they were given a description of the person they were looking for.  We're looking for a man with a red shirt.  So if you see anybody with a red shirt out there, can you please call the local authorities? 
[00:05:30]  No race, of course.  Oh, that was the description of the suspect.  The police are looking for a man leaving the scene with a red shirt.  With a red shirt.  That he can't change.  So please report everybody that is wearing a red shirt today because the cops are looking for this poor girl's killer.  How about a fucking race?  To really narrow it down, could you say black, Hispanic, white, Asian, purple?  Although we know.  But I mean, just come on.  At least say it. 
[00:06:00]  Could you just fucking say the race?  Wow.  Why won't they describe the race?  In the old days, they used to say it.  A black male, age 20, between 20 and 25 years old.  I've left the scene.  But now, oh, you say that and you get Reverend Al Dickfuck calling up, threatening a protest because you described the suspect.  What the fuck is that about? 
[00:06:30]  Well, we can find the guy.  He's wearing a red shirt today.  He's got a red shirt.  He couldn't have changed it, right?  No, I don't think he will.  He could change his skin color, though.  Yeah, I don't think he's going to change his shirt.  But he's not going to change that shirt.  Well, we'll get the guy.  We'll get the guy.  It's infuriating to watch that.  We just like bringing that to everyone's attention.  Very, very strange how that is being reported.  On the news, by the way, too.  Liberal bullshit media that just doesn't want to fucking say what the real story is.  Just white people who feel bad and guilty. 
[00:07:00]  It's embarrassing.  Don't say it.  It brings down everybody in that culture.  Oh, shut up.  Fucking describe it.  God.  So, yeah, we got that going today as well.  They always talk about Whitey, though.  If Whitey does something, describes a white male, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Just come on.  I'm tired of it.  No surprise.  Happens all the time.  I'm tired of this reverse racism bullshit.  I'm tired of this fucking coddling, coddling of black people. 
[00:07:30]  Oh, I was reading the whole thing on reparations.  God, the fucking, they, what, wanting reparations.  You're paid in full.  Shut up.  Between my tax dollars and your welfare, enough already.  Just shut the fuck up about reparations.  Had it.  He's showing me a picture of Steve in a red shirt.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, Steve.  Yes.  Steve, the guy.  The key is I don't flee.  There you go. 
[00:08:00]  There's a guy in a red shirt, so we should report Steve today.  Shots were fired on my back.  Yeah.  Let's report Steve today.  Get him yanked out of this building.  Make his day miserable.  And another visual bit, and then we'll move on.  The two-year-old smoking is everywhere today.  It's fantastic.  Joe Rogan was the one who turned me on two ago.  Uncle Paul.  On the Twitter last night.  Yeah.  And at first, I studied the video a lot because I'm thinking, there's no fucking way this is real. 
[00:08:30]  And I'm trying to figure out where, you know.  It's not real.  I was trying to figure out where it was fake.  And, you know, and obviously it is real.  And the news has now picked up on it.  Some kid that I think smokes two packs of cigarettes, 40 cigarettes a day.  Little Xander will not smoke until he's four.  He's a two-year-old that smokes 40 cigarettes a day.  40 a day.  And he knows how to smoke them, too.  Yeah, he looks all cool smoking. 
[00:09:00]  He knows how to socialize.  You know how you socialize with your cigarette?  Yeah, yeah.  You kind of use the cigarette as you're talking.  You've got to have a technique.  Right.  While you're smoking.  Kids that smoke look silly because they don't know how to do it.  But if you're two and you're smoking, yeah, you pick that up.  You know how to wave that butt around.  Where is it?  Indonesia.  Yeah.  Of course it is.  The video was on YouTube.  Everybody was enjoying the video.  And then YouTube, I don't know what's going on with this world. 
[00:09:30]  YouTube decided they have to get this video off their site for some reason.  Why?  I don't know.  It's something that is happening.  It's something people want to check out.  It's not like he was smoking a pole.  What the fuck?  Them with their sex thing.  Whatever.  You could go anywhere and find some really good sex clips.  But for a kid smoking a cigarette, yeah, that's news.  It is news.  They should have left it up there.  But I think there's another place where it's at. 
[00:10:00]  I believe Joe Rogan tweeted the new place where he could find it.  Anytime something gets popular, like YouTube, when it first came out,  you pop shit up on there.  Who gives?  Here's the kid smoking.  Two-year-old.  He's digging that.  Wow, and he takes one drag right after another.  He's got a good technique, too, man.  How do we know he's only two?  It's adorable.  He's probably been working fucking soldering together iPads for the past year. 
[00:10:30]  Anyway.  And you used to be a smoker.  He's got good technique, right?  He does.  Very good technique.  He looks like an old man.  Yeah, well, that smoking will do it.  Yeah, well.  He looks like he's eight years old now because of that damn smoking.  Yeah, he's a little fucking old man kid.  They're just snapping pictures.  No one's knocking the cigarette out of his hand.  They're just snapping pictures like, yeah, look, this is funny. 
[00:11:00]  And he smokes 40 of these a day.  Yeah.  40.  Later, he shoots darts out of his ass at balloons at the sex fucking bar in Indonesia.  You know, the world.  Stop with your savage country.  The world really has changed.  If this was the 40s or 50s, that would be, you would pay, what, a quarter?  Yeah.  At some kind of freak show?  At a freak show?  Watch the two-year-old smoke cigarettes?  There'd be lines for days.  A healthy child smoking cigarettes.  Nine out of ten doctors surveyed said. 
[00:11:30]  Now we all have to be outraged.  We all want to check that out.  None of us are outraged.  Maybe a few are like, oh, wow, that's bad parenting, whatever.  It's a goof because it's some...  But I don't know the fucking people, so to me it's like, that's really cool and I want  to check that out.  And he doesn't look like an American kid, so we don't care.  True.  That's what happens.  They're speaking some weird language.  Yeah, yeah.  We're very much like that.  You know, if that was just some little fucking kid from Iowa smoking, there'd be outrage.  The parents would have the kids taken away. 
[00:12:00]  There'd be all kinds of outrage, but now it's just kind of, ha-ha, look at the kids smoking.  Yeah, why not?  That's funny because he's more brown than we are.  And my God, he lives very far away.  And he's chubby from eating a lot of blubber because they have a lot of blubber in their  diet.  Look at that kid.  He's a fat-smoking motherfucker.  Yeah, well.  With good technique.  Where are his parents?  Huh?  I think they're just in the background. 
[00:12:30]  Yeah?  Is that that?  I want to know the full story.  I wonder if they make money off the kid smoking 40 cigarettes a day.  How does he afford his smokes?  Huh?  How does he afford his smokes?  He can't even afford, like, shoes and a shirt.  Do we know more on this?  I want to know more about this kid.  How does he afford his smokes?  That's a great question.  Those little lungs must just get fucked up by cigarettes.  Like, those little, just growing lungs.  They're very pink.  Yeah, yeah.  At first, they're probably fucking, like, just completely pink.  It's that shade of pink that only youth has. 
[00:13:00]  He wakes up in the morning with just a hacker's cough.  I had two years old.  He's...  The other kids are napping.  He's going to go outside and cut a butt.  Yeah.  I love this kid.  Fucking great.  Freaking out, looking for a clip.  Runs out of cigarettes.  You know, when I was a bar smoker, I wish I could have looked as cool as this kid does.  He takes a lot of drag.  One right after the other, too.  I never looked that cool smoking.  I looked like a fucking dork trying to look cool when I did the smoking thing. 
[00:13:30]  Yeah, he's got it down.  He does have it down.  What the fuck is that eel rocking by the oil spill?  Yeah, maybe the eel shouldn't go by the oil.  See?  It's like scouting.  Yeah.  I ought to steal some of the oil.  Was that live?  Is that real or fake?  Oh, no.  Eel checks out BP oil leak video.  Is that real or fake?  It's got to be real.  That's real.  It's got to be fucking real.  What, did he go right into it?  What's he doing?  He's fake, man.  He's checking it out.  He's trying to figure it out.  That's fake.  Nah, that's real.  Really?  It's kind of real.  It's absolutely real. 
[00:14:00]  I can't tell, but...  How did the top kill go?  You know anything on the top kill?  They're still working on it.  They'll know a little later on.  They said 60% to 70% shares?  Maybe tomorrow they'll know if it's going to work.  They're pumping all kinds of heavy mud and cement in there, hoping it clogs that pipe up and  they don't have to worry about it.  And then what happens?  Isn't that just a temporary fix?  Yeah, they're drilling a relief well next to this one.  Oh, how long does that take?  It takes a while.  Really?  Yeah.  They have to go down a mile?  Yeah, they've got to go down there. 
[00:14:30]  Well, a mile to the ocean floor and then another mile or something like that?  Yeah.  Oh, shit.  And, you know, it's oil, so kind of need it.  So they'll just set up another fucking rig and...  And so when do we find out?  Tomorrow or Saturday?  Yeah.  It's going to take a couple days?  Tomorrow.  They'll know.  They'll know by tomorrow.  Enough already.  Fucking plug that goddamn thing.  Plug up the hole.  That's what Obama said.  Plug that hole.  I know.  We kind of had fun with that yesterday. 
[00:15:00]  American Idol.  I know you didn't watch it, but it was a star-studded event with Alice Cooper, Michael McDonald,  Alanis Morissette, Chicago.  Bret Michaels comes stumbling on the stage.  What an eclectic collection of celebrities.  Joe Cocker.  Cocker?  I didn't even know her.  Past Idol winners.  They said goodbye to Simon.  They had Paula Abdul.  They had Janet Jackson.  Did Paula seem a little pilled out? 
[00:15:30]  Paula Abdul?  Yeah.  Was she actually able to keep it together for one appearance on the show?  Well, Sam watched the whole thing, and he was tweeting, because he's a huge fan of  American Idol.  I watched for the goofing, and so I could maybe rip it apart a little bit.  But Sam actually loved the show, thought it was the best finale ever.  Simon, I just want to say you're one of the greatest people I've ever worked with.  What a fucking drugged up bitch she was when she was on the show. 
[00:16:00]  That's pretty much what she did.  She was doing a roast or something.  All of a sudden, she was up there for four minutes of nonsense.  Simon, you limey motherfucker.  The English, it's a fag country.  She roasted everybody, and she ended with Simon.  And then she sat on Simon's lap.  Oh, did she?  Simon, fuck her, tag her in the asshole? 
[00:16:30]  Did he go A to M?  I love ass to mouth.  Who doesn't love ass to mouth?  It's a little rough.  It's a little rough.  Paula just taking it.  So, Sam, the big Idol finale.  Yeah, I mean, I thought it was a fairly weak season as far as Idol seasons go.  Probably the weakest season they've ever had.  Yes.  But I thought that they ended very strong.  I think it qualifies as an extravaganza. 
[00:17:00]  It was.  From what I saw, boy, they were dragging out past Idols.  It was amazing.  And poor Dane Cook got fucked last night.  Dane Cook had a nice...  Oh, no.  Ass to mouth?  No ATM.  Literally?  Okay, I'm sorry.  But he got the big gig where he came up with a song for Simon.  Yeah.  He was singing it.  And then they brought out all those freaky fucking singers over the years.  Ah.  All those freaky guys that keep your attention early on in Idol.  Thank God. 
[00:17:30]  They're just golden, all of those.  It's so funny to watch them.  They're all goofy.  Leave.  Do we have that video online?  Because then all of a sudden, he's singing a song.  He's getting close to the end.  And one of these freaks grabs the mic and starts yelling...  Mike?  What did he yell?  Bernardo.  Bernardo.  I don't know who Bernardo is.  Bernardo.  Which idiot was he?  He grabbed the mic and started saying, it's all about Bernardo.  It's all about Bernardo.  And I'm going to take your place, Simon.  Which jerk-off was he during the auditions?  What's his memorable shithead moment?  A couple seasons ago, he was just very full of himself and had a very thick, like, maybe 
[00:18:00]  Brooklyn type of accent.  Oh, okay.  But a bit flamboyant.  A gay Brooklyn type thing.  A gay Brooklyn Ginzo?  What was he?  Yeah.  Really?  I mean, I don't know if you'll find the video online, unfortunately.  Hopefully.  Why?  Are they, like, making sure none of these...  The idol shows are tougher to find.  Oh, really?  Well, so then, all of a sudden, he does his Kanye West thing.  Now Dane Cook can't finish his fucking song. 
[00:18:30]  And then there's some, like, frumpy woman that runs from the side of the stage and now  is, like, having a tug-of-war with the guy on live TV.  And I'm like...  What, like a stagehand?  Of whoever.  Like a producer or something.  And just a frumpy woman.  And I'm like, now this is fucking why I watch live TV.  Time and time again, we talk about this on the show, too.  Here's a real moment.  I'm sure they capitalized on it.  It's going fucking down.  Next thing you know, they have a shot from the back of the auditorium, so the people are  as big as fucking ants.  And they cut to commercial immediately. 
[00:19:00]  I'm like, will you let this play out?  They have no fucking clue.  It's fucking playing out in the auditorium.  Let it play out for the audience at home.  No clue what is entertaining.  Spontaneity has no place on live television.  No.  They need everything honed to a...  Polished.  To perfection before they put it on TV.  Yeah.  How about that?  It's a live television show.  Here's a moment where some... 
[00:19:30]  One of these idiots, they bring in the lunatics for just that purpose.  Of course.  He acts like an idiot.  Of course.  And a lunatic.  And then some fucking frump has to come out and ruin everyone's fun time.  Yeah.  So...  So...  Hate it.  Just when it was getting good...  I mean, he's...  Disgusted today.  Are you?  Just with things like this.  Well, I mean, just when...  I don't understand their logic.  I mean, maybe someone that understands TV could help us out, because just when it was getting  good, they cut away.  I mean, it's still happening in the auditorium. 
[00:20:00]  No one's going to get killed or anything.  Dane Cook said if the guy touched him, he was going to just beat the shit out of him.  Right.  Great.  But they don't want to fight on their American Idol television show.  But why?  It's family friendly.  Would have been great.  Family friendly.  And also, everything has to be timed to the minute.  You have to root watch in that show.  The husbands are beating the wives in the poem anyway.  There you go.  It gives a shit.  The kids see it every night.  Kids crying.  Spaghetti's hitting the wall.  Why are you so angry?  Wow.  What happened?  You told me that you hung out in your pool all day long. 
[00:20:30]  You had a great afternoon.  I had a great afternoon yesterday.  Where the fuck did it turn?  Driving into this place?  Yeah.  You know something?  I think you're right.  A couple of cabbies just fucking being cabbies.  We really got to change some things so we could come here and be happy again.  Oh, God.  We need some changes.  We need a flying car.  We need some changes.  It's going to happen for at least two, three more years.  Two or three more decades.  Yeah.  Oh, three years, I thought.  No.  Oh, literal.  Oh.  I was reading a nice Popular Mechanics from 1955. 
[00:21:00]  Right.  Oh, was it hysterical.  First of all, not a black person to be found in that thing.  Well, that made you happy.  Jiminy Cricket.  And then just everything was, if you're an inventor, they wanted you.  A lot of army surplus stuff they were selling, like telegraph wire.  What?  Yeah.  And then they had a police vehicle.  This was amazing.  It's a police vehicle that as they're chasing somebody or following someone, it recorded 
[00:21:30]  right out the windshield what went on.  It recorded it.  What are you talking about?  Well, you know.  Dashcams?  Oh, you could call it that.  You could call it that.  In 1955, this was amazing.  Wow.  And, by the way, this thing took up half the fucking car.  Well, you couldn't even see the road.  It was ridiculous.  Because you didn't have room for the camera.  The cop is squeezed in trying to drive as this behemoth of a camera is next to him, 
[00:22:00]  pointing a giant lens.  It looked like one of those old Dumont cameras they used to film the Texaco Star Theater.  Kind of like a Steve Allen thing.  Giant.  When Steve Allen decided to hit the streets for the first time.  And then it said, and it could even tell you the speed and time.  Wow.  So I'm thinking, wow, let me see what that looked like.  Like, they superimposed another camera that was on a clock, a regular TikTok-type clock,  and that was up in the corner. 
[00:22:30]  Oh, grace.  It was hysterical.  All this, like, old shit, though.  Where do you get these old popular mechanics?  Eh, you can find them.  Do you, like, buy them?  No, I don't buy them.  Are they online?  Somebody knew that I enjoyed these things and dropped them off for me.  It was fantastic.  Actually, I'm not sure if it's popular mechanics or popular science,  but there's an archive of every single one online somewhere.  Those would be cool to check out.  Yeah, just kind of came out.  They really are.  To see how they're talking about the future.  Fun to see.  Yeah, that's what you would like. 
[00:23:00]  I like looking at, like, the future.  Right.  And then there were classified ads,  and they're, like, showing shit for people that want to invent stuff and whatever it is.  And then it's, like, ads for women.  And it was nothing but cooking shit and aprons.  Oh, I thought you meant ads for women, meaning, you know,  someone's looking for a little something, something.  Oh, no, no, not looking for a bitch.  It was just ads that were specifically targeted for women.  Because they'd look through the other classifieds and just be dumbfounded by science. 
[00:23:30]  Yeah, right.  They see a hammer, they're trying to eat it.  Yeah, they have no idea.  They're just being beaten by the hammer by their miserable husband,  who's fucking his secretary, comes home, drinks a double, and beats her with a bald bean.  While she's wearing her cocktail dress in the middle of the afternoon.  Some whore didn't have a fucking dinner on the table when he got home.  She deserved it.  Yeah, popular science has their entire 137-year archive online.  Fuck, that would be cool, man.  It is really cool to look at, like, some of the dumb things. 
[00:24:00]  Oh, so was there a flying car in there?  Because that's what we were talking about.  Flying car?  No.  Oh, just the dashboard cam that takes up half the windshield.  They didn't know about anything.  And it was, yeah, they really tried to push that, be a television radio technician.  You're selling a .22 caliber German automatic pistol for $6.69.  What year is that, Danny?  I just clicked on it really quickly.  I think it's like 19, it's either 57 or 58.  And you didn't need anything, believe me. 
[00:24:30]  Lowest price ever.  Earn money at home spray-painting cars.  Look, the gun's only, let's call it $7, just under $7.  What is that in today's money, though?  I know.  Well, you should see some of these things, too.  It's like, earn $7 a day profit, sheer profit.  Wow, nice.  Selling greeting cards.  Nice.  And then there was this thing that was going on, and I'd love to know if anybody knows about this and why, but half of the classified ads were remailing. 
[00:25:00]  They had remailing from Paris, France.  Remail from New York.  Which I don't understand what that means, too.  I don't know what it is.  I believe, from what I got from it, I guess everyone knew about it back then, but I kind of was getting the gist that you would mail a letter to this place.  And they would take it and remail it from France to whatever address you wanted it sent to.  For what reason? 
[00:25:30]  I haven't a clue.  Was it a war thing?  No, it was post-war.  It was like 1955.  Oh, it was in the 50s.  So, for some reason, I don't know why, you would want a letter sent from France to another address.  Would it start in America?  Yeah, it would start like in your fucking hometown.  And would you be mailing?  So, say you wanted to mail it to, you know, Shirley in Omaha, Nebraska.  But you wanted her to think it came from France. 
[00:26:00]  But why?  Or think it came from New York.  Maybe because, to make believe you're a hotshot.  Maybe.  But they also had places that, you know, you wouldn't really give a shit about.  Does anyone know what that's about?  Maybe remailing back in the 50s.  I have no idea.  I didn't know what it was.  And then there was a dictaphone machine, which I just laugh at the name.  It's funny, a dictaphone.  Dick.  Ah, secretary, get in there for some oral dictation.  And it said, they were really psyched because it was this, like a belt. 
[00:26:30]  It was a magnetic belt that recorded the thing.  It wasn't a tape or a wire or anything else.  It was a belt.  It wasn't the tubes?  No, or tube or nothing.  It was an actual belt?  Like a belt.  That they said you could record and then flatten it for easy mailing.  Oh, my God.  So you would record something, put it in an envelope, and snail mail it somewhere.  And their big thing was, if you made a mistake, you could move the belt backwards and record over your mistake. 
[00:27:00]  Wow.  Stop it.  Stop it.  That's the future.  It's fantastic.  I love this shit.  I like reading old newspapers, but I think I've got to start reading old magazines now.  Old, uh, corn turned into fuel.  There's an article about, uh, about that biofuel.  And I just, this magazine's from 1947.  47.  They're talking about corn turned into fuel.  Oh, this guy must have just been shot right after he wrote this, though.  Some fucking...  April, April 1947. 
[00:27:30]  A guy in a fedora put a pistol to the back of that motherfucker's head.  They just don't want that technology to take off.  Why?  We have oil.  They've been talking about it for 60-some-odd years.  That means it has to work.  And they just don't want anyone doing that.  There was a great article about how the U.S. military was helping Iran.  What?  Yes.  With, um, uh, pesticides.  They were sending over pesticides.  And it's like, so the Iranians are using DDT. 
[00:28:00]  And they were using DDT.  We were sending them DDT.  Who was the president back then?  I don't know.  It was 55.  Let's go kiss his grave.  Was that Harry?  Or was that after Harry?  Harry S.  Truman.  I'm not sure.  All right.  Well, fuck it.  He was the guy after Harry.  You've got to bring more of this to the show.  I want to hear about, uh, what they thought the future was going to be back in 1950, 55.  Oh, and a lot of, yeah, get strong.  Don't be a 97-pound weakling. 
[00:28:30]  Where this strong guy is completely cock-blocking a skinny guy on the beach.  So, so the, the, they have a little comic strip, uh, about the, the big brawny guy that  you could be, and he's on the beach, and this skinny guy is sitting there with his  chick, and the big guy comes over and kicks sand on the skinny guy, and takes his bitch  away.  I was in, in the back of all the comic books and stuff.  But when you look at it now, you really think, like, what a fuck?  Right.  You know, just because you're a bigger guy, I'll fucking shoot you, you guy. 
[00:29:00]  I'll shoot you with that German $3 pistol you could buy.  Me and Anthony were on the, uh, finale of American Idol, by the way.  They just showed a clip on TV as he was talking.  Hall and Oates?  Yeah.  Okay.  Boy, I love all the people that thought they were original with that one on Twitter last  night.  Hey, Hall and Oates!  Hey, I didn't know you and Anthony were in LA last night!  Ha ha ha!  You're gonna get back in time and do the show tomorrow?  Ha ha ha!  Jesus.  Although, Dr. Steve came up with a new one.  He thought I was one of the guys from Chicago. 
[00:29:30]  Oh, really?  The bassist, I think.  The bassist, or one of the horn players?  I don't know.  You're pulling that one off?  Sorry, and I interrupted, but it was a clip on TV.  Men, bulging waistlines, flattened in seconds, without diet or exercise with the manly.  What the fuck is the manly?  It's called the manly.  The new three-way abdominal supporter.  It's a girdle for a man.  It's a fucking girdle?  Yes, a girdle.  That's the best they could do to get your body in shape back then.  In the back of the magazine, there was an ad for Camel Cigarettes, where, of course, doctors told you it was great. 
[00:30:00]  And John Wayne is sitting there smoking.  It had a testimonial from him saying, I've been a Camel smoker for 26 years.  Oh, shit.  Well, keep smoking.  They'll fucking put you in the ditch with your ravaged lungs.  How great is it?  You know how it ends.  Oh, you know how that one ends.  You're looking at John Wayne going, oh.  I don't think those doctors are pitching for butts anymore, my friend. 
[00:30:30]  Here in the future, we know what happens to the Duke.  We know the Duke died of the cancer.  You know, happy birthday to the Duke.  Oh, yeah?  How old would the Duke have been?  I think it was yesterday or a couple days ago.  103 he would have been.  I'll show you how to make yourself commando tough in double quick time.  Yeah, what's that about?  It won't cost you a cent.  Is that MMA fighting?  World's greatest bodybuilder, this guy says.  It's just, they had a lot of things that were to make you strong, learn television and radio repair. 
[00:31:00]  You know what?  It's all the same stuff that it is now.  You know, get in shape.  Here's the new media that you want to be attracted to.  It's just all the same stuff.  Right on, man.  That's very cool.  It is interesting, man.  Someone's going to tell us what the remailing thing's all about.  Thank God.  Mark in Jersey.  Hey, guys.  How you doing today?  Good.  Okay, so this is actually the origination of the Ponzi scheme.  Back in the 50s and 60s, if you mailed a letter and it was, let's say, the postage was 10 cents, 
[00:31:30]  but the postage rate was only, like, three cents, you would actually be able to get that extra seven cents.  So when you would remail from Europe, the postage was less.  So let's say it was three cents to Europe and, like, three cents back, they would keep that extra four cents.  If you look it up online, you'll see it's the origination of the Ponzi scheme.  So that's why if you over postage, you don't get that money back anymore. 
[00:32:00]  Oh, you used to get the money back?  You used to get the money back.  So let's say...  Wait a minute.  How does this work?  Now, why is it cheaper to mail overseas?  That's the way it was back then.  So it was cheaper to mail a letter to France than it was to mail a letter to fucking California?  To California, exactly.  So walk me through this, say it.  So you would put the postage on.  You needed three cents to get it overseas, but you would put more than three cents? 
[00:32:30]  Yeah, you would put, like, it would be a ten-cent stamp or whatever it was back then.  So it would be three cents to Europe, and then when that would get over to Europe,  they would go take that to the post office, get seven cents, and then put another stamp on it,  let's say it was three cents, to come back, and they would make four cents on it.  But who would you mail it to in France?  The remailer.  There were actual mailing centers, the remailers.  Remailing center.  So you really didn't...  You weren't mailing anything, really. 
[00:33:00]  You were just using that to make money.  No, you were just using it to make a few cents.  So you didn't give a shit where the letter ended up, right?  So it was basically an ad to rip off the post office.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Yeah, you're ripping off, which in essence is ripping off the American people who support the post office.  Well, in the 60s, there was a guy that made, like, a ton of money doing this, and that's why they stopped doing it.  Oh, yeah?  He's the origination of the Ponzi scheme, they said.  All right, we learned about remailing.  I had no clue on that one until today.  Thanks, Mark. 
[00:33:30]  Take care, guys.  All right.  Do you want to get back to American Idol real fast?  Sure.  Anything else in that magazine?  That's some cool shit.  I'm going to – I have about 20 of them.  Yeah, bring all that stuff in.  So I'll go through some of the stuff that they thought was going to be futuristic.  I like the dashboard cam.  That's pretty cool.  Stopping distance on a speedometer?  No, the speedometer.  The speedometer.  They would put that, like, how many feet it would take to stop at a certain speed. 
[00:34:00]  Yeah, I guess they were thinking that this would be a safety feature that you'd find on cars in the future.  So let's say you go 50 miles an hour.  What would that mean?  Well, according to this particular model car, it would take you 130 feet to stop.  Now it's like nothing.  At 50 miles an hour?  No way.  What the fuck?  Are you Fred Flintstone putting your feet down?  Come on.  Rubbing off your heels to slow down your car?  That's great.  With a fucking car that's just solid steel, your body took the entire impact of the crash. 
[00:34:30]  No crumple zones.  No safety.  No airbags.  There's a giant fucking just stainless steel dashboard to pound your face into.  A seatbelt that guaranteed you to be chopped in half.  Of course.  Just a waist belt.  They didn't really understand.  Maybe you need it around your shoulder and not just around your waist.  Oh, flying wing goes jet.  Look at that.  That's a stealth bomber.  The first stealth bomber.  And that was a UFO.  That didn't work out very well.  That was a UFO back then.  Ah, rats.  The caller's an idiot.  Shit, Ant. 
[00:35:00]  I thought we knew.  I thought we'd learn.  All right.  Let's see.  Chris from Columbus.  Hey, Chris Columbus.  Get it?  Oh, shut up.  Yeah.  Chris?  The original Ponzi scheme was started by an Italian grifter named Charles Ponzi in the  early 1900s, not by some jack-offs mailing excess postage back and forth across the Atlantic  Ocean.  If that dope would do a little goodling to find out exactly where the name Ponzi scheme  came from, he would realize he was as wrong as Obama is on just about everything. 
[00:35:30]  Well, maybe he said the original Ponzi scheme, but he meant like an early Ponzi scheme.  Yeah, but I like this guy, because all you have to do is put Ponzi into the Google, and  I think you would come up with where it came from.  And this guy from Florida says remailing for stamp collecting.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Let's go to Jake in Florida.  Jake.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Hi, sir.  Yeah, I think I saw that on the Pawn Stars thing, that they would send off their letters, 
[00:36:00]  and then it would come back from other countries, and you'd have that stamp from the other country  on the envelope.  Oh, so it sounds innocent enough.  Yeah.  Just to collect stamps.  There were a lot of ads for stamp collecting.  Like, people were really into stamp collecting.  I guess they had nothing else to do.  No internet.  No, they were actually worth something, too, the stamps.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No internet.  No nothing to have fun with, so.  Yeah, and this guy says that remailer thing doesn't make sense because somebody had to 
[00:36:30]  pay the dime for the stamp.  They don't just give them to you.  It doesn't seem like, like, as I'm working it through my head, there's no way to really  make money off of that.  Right.  All right.  So, American Idol, Sam.  Yeah.  Yeah, American Idol.  It was a good show.  Walk Anthony through this.  No, it wasn't.  You didn't have any, like, oh, my goodness moments.  Oh, the Dane Cook thing.  So, it ends, so they went to the commercial, so there's a great moment, and they go, we  can't have this on live TV, so they bailed really quickly with the long shot and then  right to commercial. 
[00:37:00]  And then, uh, Dane on his Twitter wrote, weirdo equals fuckface.  That wasn't planned.  I don't want people thinking that I was part of some stupid set-up bit.  A wacky bit?  He was fucking pissed.  Not a happy camper.  Not at all.  He could have taken out Bernardo easily.  Well, he said, uh, you know, if he got touched or if the mic hit him, he would have,  you know.  That would have been good.  He would have beat him down right on that stage.  I mean, it would have been cool to see, but I'm assuming the producers do not want a Dane  Cook fight on the American Idol finale.  Listen to how that sounds. 
[00:37:30]  That would have been great.  Thank you.  A Dane Cook fight.  A Dane Cook fight on American Idol.  That would be everywhere.  Yeah.  That would be great.  And guess what?  American Idol's going to need some fucking help after the season.  Yeah, they're dropping ratings and...  They've lost a lot of viewers this season, and now you lose Simon Cowell.  You really think this show's going to survive?  I think the X Factor...  Maybe another year or two, and that's it.  The X Factor's going to be where it's at next season.  And that's Simon Cowell's new show.  And isn't it the same show?  Pretty much.  It's very similar.  And it's going to be on Fox, so Fox isn't worried about American Idol. 
[00:38:00]  Only he produces it, I bet.  Right, so he gets all the money.  The X Factor's new guy, instead of that Simon Fuller.  Exactly.  He's smart that way.  What are the highlights from the show last night?  Well, for me, there were a lot of highlights.  Well, I want to...  I'm a dumb show.  I wanted to play a couple things for Anthony, because they brought out a lot of very old  performers.  They can't get young singers and young bands for this American Idol?  They did.  This show is for the kids.  It's for the kids.  Why is Chicago out there?  Chicago is for guys that are even older than me and Ann. 
[00:38:30]  It was an odd choice.  I thought it was cool, but it was...  There's a lot of teenagers watching American Idol.  They could give a shit about Chicago.  It was odd that the opening act was Alice Cooper.  Even that's odd.  How about Mike McDonald?  It's Alice Cooper.  Alice Cooper could still do it, but...  I mean, it's 60s.  He could still do it, but it's not his audience.  That's the point I'm making.  Why is Mike McDonald...  Who fucking wants to see Michael McDonald?  Listen to how he sounds.  Who wants to see him?  He used to have that very distinctive voice.  Yeah.  He can't fucking...  He can't hit the notes anymore. 
[00:39:00]  You don't know me, but I'm your...  He's performing with Big Mike.  Yeah, what they did, Ann, also...  All of a sudden, like, an idol guy or girl  would start singing a song, a very popular song,  and then the guy that originally sang it  or the band that originally sang it  comes from the back and continues singing.  Oh, it's exciting.  Wow.  So we didn't know.  He has a big...  Like, whoa!  So here's Big Mike performing with Michael McDonald.  Big Mike starts,  and you'll know when Mike McDonald hits the stage.  Tell me what you think, if he could still do it. 
[00:39:30]  You don't know me, but I'm your brother.  No, you're not.  I was raised here in this living day.  You don't know my kind in your world.  Well, he's soon the time will tell you. 
[00:40:00]  Tell me what the days you're gonna do for me.  He's coming.  That should have been his part.  I ain't glad and I don't like what I've been going to see.  He can't go that long.  Where's Michael McDonald?  The hero's song.  I want to feel to this.  Right.  That's right.  Big Mike came in for you. 
[00:40:30]  Ladies and gentlemen, Michael McDonald.  Mr. Abton John.  Oh.  Big Mike Lynch, everybody.  Take this message to my birth.  You will find me everywhere wherever people live together.  The target palm of cheese dispel of you. 
[00:41:00]  Wow.  Yeah.  He used to have that distinctive voice.  He's a little more gravelly than he used to be.  A little?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, you're gonna say that he's still pulling it off?  He was there.  I mean, you know, he just shakes it up a little more than the original version.  He probably got bored of singing it the same way for 30, 40 fucking years.  Yeah.  But why is he on American Idol? 
[00:41:30]  I don't know.  For what?  That's a very good question.  I don't know.  Same reason that they closed with Joe Cocker.  Yeah, Joe Cocker.  What is the...  What would you do if I sang her to...  Guess what song he sang.  Would you stand up and walk out on me?  Well, now he doesn't know.  Lay on me a wheel and I'm singing you a song.  Can you look up there?  I would try not to sing out of key.  Oh, I can't.  I would look up.  I would look up.  I would look up.  Okay. 
[00:42:00]  Enough with him.  Joe Cock.  I tweeted that he looked like an old Woody Harrelson, and someone tweeted that he looks like a very white, old Fred Sampson.  Yeah.  Fred Sampson.  I'm sorry.  Fred Sanford.  Hey, dummy.  Don't cut my hair, dummy.  Looks like a very old, white, red fox.  How about that?  We've got to look up the demographics for American Idol.  It doesn't make sense because it's younger demos.  No one knows who the fuck Joe Cocker is.  Joe Cocker.  Or if they do know, they don't care. 
[00:42:30]  Maybe they're starting to count on the housewives.  They're like, oh, Joe Cocker, he was at Woodstock.  And they'll be like, oh, after Green Day?  And then you go, no.  No, no.  No, no.  See, it was the one before.  And they're like, what?  What are you talking about?  No, Woodstock 99?  Which one?  Which one?  Uh-huh.  They don't.  He sings with Lee and Crystal.  The finalists.  Oh.  Oh.  How does she start first?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[00:43:00]  They do.  Lee and Crystal most of them.  That's Lee.  Oh.  Almost sounds like a young Joe Cocker.  That's why it's so successful.  You'll know when Joe hits the stage.  He looks homeless.  Had a weird jacket on.  Yeah.  All his teeth are rotting.  Joe Cocker's teeth are rotting.  Bad haircut.  Huh?  He had a bad haircut.  It looked horrendous. 
[00:43:30]  It looked horrendous in 1969.  Oh, that's the...  Yeah.  His teeth were brown and rotting.  Where's Joe?  Oh, here's Joe.  You never want to be a living legend.  What do I do when my love is away?  Oh.  Does it worry you to be alone?  Where is he?  Yeah.  How do I feel about the end of the day? 
[00:44:00]  This is like bad karaoke.  Yeah.  It's Joe.  The kids had to kind of carry him through it a little bit.  I try and give a breath.  How many songs did he have that were popular?  This?  He had a few.  A Beatles remake and what else?  Well, I don't remember Joe Cocker's songs right now, but he had a few.  I don't remember Joe Cocker's songs right now, but he had a few. 
[00:44:30]  Steve McClendon said it sounds like people screaming in a car crash. 
[00:45:00]  It's horrendous.  He doesn't even sound like Joe Cocker anymore.  Did they drag Richie Havens out, too?  Fuck.  All the legends.  Damn it.  No hip young people for American Idol last night.  They assume the young people are going to watch for the American Idol contestants and the older 
[00:45:30]  people are going to watch for this?  Yeah.  I remember the Joe Cocker.  There were a lot of big moments.  The Janet Jackson thing was big.  The Janet Jackson thing was creepy because her new song I was telling Anthony sounds like  Michael Jackson.  It was like one of those whispery songs that Michael Jackson used to do.  Yeah, she was.  She sounded like Michael Jackson.  She changed her voice.  She was like little boy's ball bags.  Like she was channeling Michael Jackson or something.  That's true.  Her voice totally changed.  It's a song called They Cry, They Tattle. 
[00:46:00]  I mean, I'll show you the monkey if you suck my dick.  That's the song.  That's the new song.  That's the song.  She's got a big ass, too, man.  She was looking good.  Except for her short hair.  Danny likes to get her ass.  Did you see Janet Jackson's ass last night?  She's always been on the high end.  She's got a big ol' waist.  She's always been on the high tolerance.  I know she's getting a little long in the tooth, but she's got a big ol' waist.  You want to hear just maybe a quick... 
[00:46:30]  I certainly want to hear a little Janet Jackson sound like Michael.  It's her new song.  It's very whispering.  This isn't Janet yet.  That's Siobhan.  Oh, really?  What?  And then all the contestants.  I don't want to sit through this.  Where the fuck's Janet Jackson?  She's coming.  Where?  When they go, ladies and gentlemen.  Exactly for that part.  Yeah.  It builds anticipation for the audience. 
[00:47:00]  There was no anticipation last night.  There was for me.  You know, I went to bed three minutes before they announced the new idol winner.  I mean, I found out this morning, even though I watched just about the whole show.  Where's Janet?  Well, I actually got a headset mic and a handheld.  She moved on to a second song where she used a headset mic.  Nasty.  Nasty voice.  Yeah.  People are pointing out Joe Cocker totally missed the second line of his own song. 
[00:47:30]  Yeah, I know that.  He did.  He just sat there.  It's like, Joe, this is your song.  Is that her?  That's her.  Yeah, she cut her hair.  She wants to be Michael.  I think she wants to look like Michael now.  I think you're right.  Here she comes.  Listen to this.  There's something I want to say something I've been holding back.  That's Michael Jackson.  Yeah.  That's creepy.  Definitely.  Yeah.  Yeah, she's doing that whispering. 
[00:48:00]  Wow.  Maybe he's channeling her.  It's a creepy family.  It really is.  It really is creepy.  This creeped me out last night.  She's more of a man than he was.  Yeah.  I'm like, she wants to be Michael Jackson now.  Yeah.  She looks like one of the guys from Bell Biv DeVos.  What the fuck is that?  Bell Biv DeVos.  That's Janet Jackson. 
[00:48:30]  She never sounded like this.  No.  Miss Jackson is your nasty.  Yeah.  Wouldn't you bet that was a Michael Jackson song that was never released?  This isn't even a new song.  It just sounds like a new song because she used to sing it like Janet.  Like Janet?  Well, I pronounced my short A's somewhat straight to it.  I know.  I've noticed that.  We all have.  Oh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So her new thing is she's going to sound like Michael Jackson? 
[00:49:00]  I guess so.  I'm going to redo all of her songs sounding like Michael.  Look what she used to look like.  Holy shit.  Yeah.  Thumbs up feels right, Danny.  You like that plump ass on her?  I like that one, too.  How do you not?  How do you not?  No, I'm with Danny.  The young Janet Jackson.  Look at that, Ann.  Come on.  Come on.  I don't mind the ass.  I mind the hue.  I don't like that awful wig she has on, but that fucking, that lump is nice.  I'm going to drop a little stinker on you.  Oh, God. 
[00:49:30]  Yeah, yeah.  She's trying to be Michael.  It's really creepy.  Anyway.  It was a big surprise to see her out last night.  Was it for who?  Me.  Who cares?  I mean, I did.  We're doing this to just goof on her.  Who cares, though?  Really?  Bret Michaels.  What?  That was big.  He performed.  No, he didn't.  It's nice that Donald Trump gave him the day off so he could fly to L.A. for the American Idol finale.  Yeah, he's working for Donald, right?  What happened?  I thought he has to work for Donald Trump now.  What is he doing going to L.A.?  And didn't Donald Trump say on his finale that Bret Michaels was risking his life to be here tonight? 
[00:50:00]  Bret Michaels was risking his life just to be here tonight, and then Bret flies to L.A.  He flew to L.A., and then he performed?  Yeah.  That was the best part.  Because Casey James was singing Every Rose Has Its Thorn, and you're sitting there watching  going, no.  No way.  It couldn't be.  No way.  It couldn't be.  And then all of a sudden, here comes Bret out with his guitar singing.  I would say big ovation, right?  Big ovation.  Big moment.  Was he pushing with the vocals, or was he a little...  No, I'd be like, I'm going to pop a vein in my head. 
[00:50:30]  I better not fucking really sing this out.  He was way better than anything we've heard so far.  And he just did this, Every Rose Has Its Thorn.  He ended it hacky, though.  What did he say?  You better believe it, or something like that?  Yeah, I mean, he did his little...  But he was strong.  He was strong.  Because Every Rose Has Its Thorn, and he's been through all that...  All that shit lately.  A lot of thorns.  So he goes, well, you better believe that.  Or I believe that.  Medulla Oblongata has its thorn.  No, I don't even know that. 
[00:51:00]  Go on, Jeopardy, already, you fucking weirdo.  Every Rose Has Its Cloth.  All right, now we've got to do this.  A few strong.  We'll do a little of this, too, then.  What the fuck?  And that's Casey.  He came in third.  Oh, really?  Yes.  He was eliminated last week.  He did a good job.  That's why I came in third.  Was it something I said, or something I did?  Did my words not come out right? 
[00:51:30]  Though I try not to hurt you.  Though I try.  But I guess that's why...  Can't you imagine watching this and being like, no way?  No way.  No way, dude.  What's the second guitar?  Because it's offstage.  And you're like, no way.  Just like you.  I kind of saw it coming a mile away there, sir.  Well, but you're saying, no, it couldn't be.  It couldn't be.  It has to be, but it couldn't. 
[00:52:00]  Now, does it come out right now?  Yeah, you heard the very comment.  There's Brett walking out on stage.  He's a friend of ours.  I'm sorry.  Oh, that's hilarious.  He wasn't even limping anymore.  He was dying. 
[00:52:30]  I know.  He's better.  The DJ said, okay, these are coming years ago.  But I wonder, does he know, has it ever been right this?  I don't know if you're here right now, fighter.  Only did you know so I can't stand.  He held back a little bit.  Yeah, he did. 
[00:53:00]  He didn't want one of those blood vessels to burst in his forehead.  Some singers really belted out.  The veins are just vibrating in their neck and head.  He's like, I better hold back a little bit.  I'm not dying on the American Idol stage.  I'm from these zeros.  Come on, put your hands on it.  Every rose has its own.  Come on, dude.  Yeah, just like him.  Oh. 
[00:53:30]  The fat notes.  That's Casey.  Just like him.  I'm going to sing a sound.  Just see the ones that are pouring out of his ears.  Every rose has its own.  It looks like Bud Dwyer.  Oh, there it is.  Yeah, it does.  Yeah, it does.  Yeah, it does.  Wow. 
[00:54:00]  Come on.  He needs to do this like he needs a hole in the head.  Stop.  Oh, what did I say?  He's a superhero.  Yeah, he fucking pulled it off.  He really is a superhero.  He's winning Celebrity Apprentice.  He's killing on American Idol.  I was telling someone last night.  Give him an adamantium skull.  Is that what they did?  Maybe.  Yeah.  He's a mutant.  He had the best behind the music ever.  All the shit that happened to him and now he could add all this stuff. 
[00:54:30]  Now he's got an epilogue to it.  Unbelievable.  What else before we move on?  Well, all the Idol contestants coming out and singing goodbye.  I'm not going to acknowledge that.  It was a big moment.  They said goodbye to Simon.  We have Simon's speech and we have Paul Abdul babbling.  Oh, good.  You want the Paul Abdul babbling before?  Who doesn't?  All right.  We keep moving on with the Idol shit.  What about the Chicago thing?  And Atlantis.  We can't do it all.  That's what I'm saying.  It was a big, big night.  You know what?  I want to play some guy named Lee.  I don't know who the fuck he is. 
[00:55:00]  He's the American Idol.  Lee?  He won the whole thing?  He is our American Idol.  They gave it to a Chinaman?  And now you're American.  Shut up.  Mine.  His last name is Deweez or Dewise.  He's an American.  He's an American?  And Lee is his first name.  Where's he from?  Chicago.  Oh, hence Chicago?  Yeah.  Oh, now the tie-in.  Chicago.  All right.  Him and Crystal Bowersox, his opponent in the finals, both auditioned in Chicago. 
[00:55:30]  Oh.  Hey.  It's a shit.  But one of the Chicago guys, well, no, half the band were original members and the other  half are youngsters.  So I don't know what the fuck's going on with Chicago.  One of the lead singers looked like he couldn't be more than 40 years old.  Chicago's been around.  I remember being a tiny little kid and my sister would be cranking Chicago.  That has to be 30 some odd years ago.  Yeah.  Stay relevant.  So how's the lead singer only 40?  He was very young at the time.  Two-year-old smoke.  Yeah. 
[00:56:00]  They did a medley act.  A Chicago medley.  Well, listen to the vocals, I think, on the first song.  It's a little rough.  Oh, are they?  Yeah.  It doesn't sound like Chicago.  Oh, is this a guy?  That's Lee.  You're an American idol.  One man came up to me and asked me what the time was that was on my watch. 
[00:56:30]  It's a war watch.  And I said.  He said war watch.  Does anybody really know what the time is?  The time to change the channel.  Oh.  That's the new guy, though, Ed.  Listen to the new guy.  He doesn't sound like fucking Peter Cetera.  Right.  Right.  Does anybody really know what the time is? 
[00:57:00]  Does anybody really can't come by far?  If so, I can't imagine why.  We've all got time enough to come by.  Where are those Chicago harmonies?  That's what I'm saying.  It was all about the harmonies, right?  Oh, if you leave me now, you take away the biggest part of me.  Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.  No, baby, please don't go.  If you leave me now, you take away the biggest part of me.  For sure.  Where's that the other Chicago guy?  The other sound familiar, right?  So they have two new... 
[00:57:30]  Yeah, that's not Lee.  He's an American Idol.  No, what?  If you leave me now, you take away the biggest part of me.  Who's he?  He's your American Idol, huh?  What a whiny fuck.  Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.  No, baby, please don't go.  That's not...  That's Chicago.  That's why I'm playing this for you.  This is horrible.  Like Dan said, where's the harmony? 
[00:58:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  We know this one, right?  We're rocking.  25 or 624.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's it.  We're rocking.  We're rocking for the breaker day.  Ba-da-da-da-da.  We're searching for something to say. 
[00:58:30]  What was that, Lee?  That was Lee.  Okay.  Now?  Now?  Everybody together.  Everybody together.  There comes the big harmony.  Oh, that one wasn't bad at all, but...  But you got the young voice in there helping you out. 
[00:59:00]  Lee, you're an American idol.  It's not mine.  He is yours.  You voted.  America voted.  America voted.  We didn't vote for nobody.  America voted for Lee.  He was selling paint eight months ago.  Yeah.  Was he?  Glidden?  Was it Glidden?  There's a surprise.  A wannabe musician had a shit job, but now he's an American idol.  They all have shit jobs.  Who cares if he was selling paint?  Chris Daughtry was putting in mufflers.  He's not an idol. 
[00:59:30]  Huh?  He's a runner-up.  Daughtry never won anything.  Well, thank God for that.  Gregory Peck was a soda jerk.  So that was Chicago.  I need to know, the new members of Chicago, when did they lose their real lead singers?  Who are these new guys?  What are they doing playing with Chicago?  How could they use the name?  Exactly.  Chicago is a weak choice for the finale.  That one I don't agree with.  Sam.  Was the Robin and Barry Gibb thing good?  Oh, look.  I enjoyed it. 
[01:00:00]  Doesn't he look like fucking Woody Harrelson a little bit?  An old Woody Harrelson?  He kind of does.  That's him in the middle with that bald jacket?  Kind of looks like Red Fox, like someone said.  Definitely.  Fucking definitely.  Yeah, now you gotta...  Ah, all the people commenting.  Yes.  Yeah, talk about how great your fucking show was.  And what about Simon?  His big farewell, was it tearful?  Did he cry?  He got a little more emotional than he expected, but not full-on tears.  I mean, all of the American Idol winners, except for David Cook, who was conspicuous by 
[01:00:30]  his absence, were there, along with many of the more famous runner-ups.  No one noticed that he wasn't there.  I did.  I was a young man.  I don't know.  I went to England with two bad knees.  I wanted to host a reality show about singing, and my dream came true.  From 18 years ago, I left Dayton, Ohio, with two very bad knees, and a dream to become 
[01:01:00]  a Major League Baseball player.  Really, faggot?  What happened?  I think I got a dream came true.  Oh, boy.  Rapping Duke going into break, Travis, for John Wayne's 103rd birthday that he didn't get  to see.  103 would have been?  Yes.  So, let's say hi to John in Wisconsin.  John.  Hi, Chad. 
[01:01:30]  Hi.  The lead singer for Chicago, he killed himself, like, in the early 70s, and then Peter Cetera  took over the singer's job.  Yeah.  Peter Cetera was, like, the guy everybody remembers, though.  Well, I don't know about that, man.  What did the original guy sing?  What's one of his songs?  He sang most of the fucking biggies.  Most of the hits?  Get out of here, really.  I think so, yeah.  And then Chicago came back with Peter Cetera and had some kind of lame-ass shit, in my humble 
[01:02:00]  opinion.  Oh.  John, comment?  How'd he kill himself?  Shot himself.  Wow.  Right on.  Fuck that pill-taking where you have a chance.  Fucking put that barrel right in your mouth and pull the goddamn trigger.  Why'd he do it?  The gun is not a cry for help.  Absolutely not.  That's not your cry for help.  No, they're not going to pick up your pieces off the linoleum floor and put you back together.  I took five Aniston.  Please come over.  I need help. 
[01:02:30]  Grace.  Why'd he kill himself?  Do you know?  Don't know.  Don't know.  Because he was in Chicago.  He wanted to be a rocker.  Yeah.  What songs did he sing, John?  25 or 64.  Really?  That was him?  Yeah.  All the first four or five albums.  Yeah, and then Peter Cetera came along, and I think it was early 80s, right?  And he had that wimpier stuff that wasn't, I don't know.  Give me a Peter Cetera hit from Chicago.  Didn't he sing that Karate Kid song? 
[01:03:00]  Yeah.  Peter Cetera.  I like that one.  I do, yeah.  What song did Peter Cetera sing for Chicago?  I'm not gay.  I just like that Chicago.  Gay.  It inspired me to Karate Kid.  He's not going to answer me.  Holy shit.  John.  Yeah.  What song did Peter Cetera sing from Chicago?  I never bought any of his records.  Okay.  We'll have to find out ourselves.  Thank you for the info.  Let's go to David in North Carolina.  David.  Yeah, I saw this thing on A&E.  They had a Chicago special with talking to the, you know, like the three or four guys 
[01:03:30]  that were left with him, and they had a falling out with Peter Cetera.  He didn't want to have anything to do with those guys anymore.  Right.  Okay.  And now everyone's saying wrong.  It was the guitarist that killed himself.  Can our listeners get anything right?  Hey, boys, Terry Caff was the guitarist's name.  Yeah.  And he was the guy that killed himself.  And I don't think he was the lead singer.  Holy shit, we can't even figure this shit out.  Listeners, you guys are so stupid.  We get more misinformation than we give. 
[01:04:00]  We're dumber for listening to them.  They're just being retarded.  They can't help it.  Exactly.  Don't mean to be dumb.  Dumb or lazy.  Yeah.  Because we could be fucking...  Yeah, why are we listening to these blithering idiots?  Because we're lazy.  We could look it up.  We could look it up to make sure they're right.  We actually take it as fact because they sent it into a phone.  Right.  Oh, he must know what he's talking about.  He called on Waylon Hold for an hour.  Peter Cetera, though, he sang on 25-6-4, I'm pretty sure.  Yeah, I think Peter Cetera was the fucking singer. 
[01:04:30]  Come on.  No.  I guarantee that guy was thinking of Brad from Boston.  The guy who killed himself.  The one fucking guy that knew everything about Chicago just hung up.  God damn it, I needed you, too.  Wikipedia does say that he did sing on 25-6-4.  Who?  Peter Cetera.  Peter Cetera.  Yeah.  That's what I was saying.  Was he the original Chicago singer?  Yeah, he's the guy that sang all the fucking hits.  Come on.  Yeah, he sang on all of them.  That other guy didn't know what the hell he was talking about.  Well, didn't they have another singer?  Well, yeah, but Terry Capp was a lead guitar player. 
[01:05:00]  I mean, he could rip it, but he wasn't the singer.  He was a guitar player.  Oh, yeah, let's get the man Mexican on the phone.  Good job, Danny.  Whatever happened to that guy from XM?  No.  He would know everything.  You think he made the cut?  He went to Arizona.  They shipped his ass fucking back.  He didn't make the cut, Ed?  No.  The merger took him out, too?  Merger took out a lot of our friends.  All right.  Well, fuck.  That didn't keep him safe.  What do I know, man?  Peter Cetera is still alive, yes. 
[01:05:30]  That singer killed himself playing Russian roulette, see?  Oh, right.  Yeah.  Oh, whatever.  Singer, shut up.  Look it up for yourself if you care.  We don't know.  Paul Abdul.  Big surprise.  She came out on that stage last night.  Another big moment.  Thank you.  Simon, I'll get you in a minute.  Thank you, everyone.  Thank you so much.  They weren't applauding until you said thank you, Johnny.  She was fishing for that.  She was up there for almost three minutes, Ant. 
[01:06:00]  And I dare you to find something of substance here.  She got nothing accomplished in three minutes.  I'm sure.  You rocked it.  Big fan.  It's fantastic being here tonight.  I really miss everyone.  Hello, judges.  Randy and Pete.  What's up, baby?  No one gives a shit that she's there.  She almost dropped the end bombs.  Randy.  Hi, Ellen.  Hi, Paul.  How are you? 
[01:06:30]  I love you.  I love you, too.  Want to dance?  All right.  Oh, fucking face deep and muffed.  Terry, you look beautiful tonight.  You look amazing.  She looked awesome.  You look amazing.  Thank you.  So good to see you.  Thank you.  Paula, get the fuck off.  Where's my...  Ryan, wherever you are, you're so...  Right here.  You're so cute, and I want my lip gloss back.  Whoa.  Did he pull his dick out and give it to her? 
[01:07:00]  Here's your lip gloss, bitch.  That's all I got.  Good night, everybody.  Uh-oh.  Okay.  We were kidding.  Let's face it.  The only reason they wanted me back here tonight is so that I could tell all of you the real  reason why I really left.  Drugs?  That's what tonight's all about, is it?  Although I will tell you this.  Drugs.  There's a baby backstage with Simon's haircut and sweetheart. 
[01:07:30]  It's your turn to feed him.  It's your turn to feed him?  Does Simon have a kid now, I guess?  Does he?  Well, that was, I think...  It was a little joke.  Paul is saying that she was impregnated by Simon.  By Simon, right.  And they have an illegitimate child together.  Oh, oh.  And she left American Idol because she became pregnant with Simon Cowell's love child.  Everything she was doing, it has flipper hands and fucking two heads.  Yes.  There's a child back there.  He needs Demerol.  It fucking stinks, this woman. 
[01:08:00]  And her big comeback is a bust.  Yeah, I told you.  She got nothing done.  I don't care.  Look, Simon, my darling Simon, I've worked with a lot of people over the years.  Hot cheerleaders, big movie stars, world famous recording artists, even a cartoon cat.  But if I'm being truly honest, none of them holds a candle to you, my friend. 
[01:08:30]  Oh.  I thought she was going to say a bad thing.  Hold a candle to you.  Our relationship on the show, and I call it a partnership, really, Simon.  And I do call it a partnership, even though I know you'd like to think of it as more of a teacher-student thing.  You should just call it, shut the fuck up.  No, it's a partnership.  Just shut the fuck up.  But it's brought me immeasurable joy.  Oh, shut up.  I've loved all the fun we've had together.  I love all the laughter we've shared together. 
[01:09:00]  I love blowing the contestants.  No, American Idol's not going to be the same without you.  But as only I can tell you, it will go on.  That's awkward and unfunny.  Yeah, people are just like, they don't know what to do.  That was it.  People do not know what to do.  I love when the kid with the afro jerked off into my mouth.  That was a great moment.  Or when we stole Randy's fried chicken and he looked for it.  And we caught him looking for it and he was embarrassed because he's black and he didn't want to be seen looking for fried chicken. 
[01:09:30]  Fucking idiotic show.  Her dopey, drugged-out fucking speech pattern.  She's a dopey.  Oh, is she awful?  But Sam thought it was a terrific finale.  I thought it was great to goof on.  I thought it had a lot of moments.  Alanis Morissette singing You Ought to Know with Crystal Bower Socks.  Oh, yeah.  That was a big moment.  Bower Socks.  Yeah.  It was such a big moment.  We're not going to play it on our show.  Well, I mean, that's your prerogative.  I can't... 
[01:10:00]  What about Hall & Oates?  You didn't give us a clip of Hall & Oates.  Well, they didn't even want to perform with the contestants.  They didn't?  No.  They just came out by themselves?  They had the contestants sang and then they said, ladies and gentlemen, Hall & Oates.  And then all that Hall & Oates let the contestants do was the...  How did they do dreams come true?  Oh, fucking let it go.  What did they do?  What song?  Dreams Come True.  Yeah.  That stupid noise.  Oh, I hate Hall & Oates.  That's what the contestants did.  And Christina Aguilera was there. 
[01:10:30]  You don't like...  She didn't want any part of the contestants either.  Your kiss is on my lips.  No.  Because your kiss, your kiss, I can't resist.  Your piss is on my clits would be a nicer one.  This song is fucking horrendous.  I don't think I like Hall & Oates either.  Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun,  no?  No.  They remind me of my dad.  He used to listen to Make My Dreams Come True over and over.  My grandmother called him a Johnny One Note.  Language.  Wow, is she sassy.  Yeah, because he just kept playing the 45. 
[01:11:00]  Johnny One Note.  It was the same song literally 30 times.  What fucking year was that?  My dad.  What year was Johnny One Note a fucking saying?  Whenever Dreams Come True came out, my father bought the 45 and wouldn't stop.  Yeah.  Wouldn't stop.  What a horrible song.  Oh, try hearing it 65 times.  I had to listen to my dad get all mad when Simon and Garfunkel, or it might have just been  Paul Simon, when they put out that song, When I Think Back at All the Crap I Learned in  High School. 
[01:11:30]  Wow.  No clue.  It's a wonder I can think at all.  Kodachrome.  Oh, Kodachrome.  Yeah, sure.  I know it as Kodachrome.  I had to go through the song.  But at the beginning, he said, when I look back at all the crap I learned in high school,  and I was driving with him, and that song came on, and he was like, he shook his head  and he just looks at the radio and is like, I don't think that's good to have on the radio.  Why?  Because the word crap on the radio, he didn't think that was appropriate. 
[01:12:00]  What a turn of events.  Yeah, what a piece of audio garbage he was raising next to him.  Exactly.  It's like, well, I think we'll push it a little further than crap.  Yeah.  He was mad.  When I look back to all the cunts I hear on him.  He was mad at hearing crap on the radio, but all that shit he was saying in the kitchen  while you guys were having a nice plate of spaghetti.  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  Another hypocritical parent that said, you know, they look at something on TV or on the radio  and freak out, and meanwhile they're home calling each other fuckface. 
[01:12:30]  Yeah, fuckface.  That was a big one at the house.  My mom would call my dad a fuckface.  You fuckface.  You fuckface.  And it was over and over again.  Like, she wouldn't stop.  It's like, you fuckface.  And I'd be there, oh, I got a stomachache.  And she just wouldn't stop.  And my father would call her a fucking bitch.  Yeah.  Shut up, you fucking bitch.  Get out, you fuckface.  I love it.  And I'm just like, you know, if I said frig, like, hey, hey, watch your mouth. 
[01:13:00]  Where did he learn that shit, Roe?  You dumb bitch.  Fuck you, Joey.  It was your fucking fault.  You're the one saying the fucking words.  Go shit in your hat.  Fuck off, Roe.  I'm not the one raising a little fairy fucking kid.  He's got a doll.  It's a puppet.  He made it himself.  It's a fucking doll.  I'm not taking the little faggot to the store while he's carrying a doll with him.  And it was a puppet.  I just hadn't put strings on it yet. 
[01:13:30]  It's not a puppet.  It was a puppet.  It was not a puppet.  It was a puppet.  It was a fucking doll you put strings on as a fucking beard.  It was a fucking doll.  Shut up, Jimmy, you fuckface.  At least I knew I sucked dicks, doll boy.  That's classic.  That's classic.  Oh, it was terrible.  Poor Anthony.  I know.  You guys had younger fathers that were into the music of the time, though. 
[01:14:00]  My dad listened to Perry Como and fucking Frank Sinatra and all that shit.  He just missed the Beatles by like, I don't know, five years maybe?  Not even?  And then I guess Ronan Martin's laughing was on.  And it was one of those nice, calm evenings where I guess they were both intoxicated so they didn't have the energy to fight.  So they're sitting on the couch watching Ronan Martin's laughing.  And I was able to watch a little bit of it, like half of it.  And then I had to go to bed because, you know, school or some shit.  And there was a joke. 
[01:14:30]  There were two guys in fly costumes standing there.  And one turns to the other and goes, hey, your man's open.  Your man's open.  You know, because they were flies.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, wow.  So they start laughing.  They start laughing.  Yeah.  Because it is laughing.  Yes.  So they were laughing.  And then I said, I don't get it because I'm a little kid. 
[01:15:00]  I go, I don't get it.  What does that mean?  And it was like, nothing.  Don't worry about it.  I'm like, you can talk to a little something.  And then years later, it hit me.  Like, that stuck in my head for years that I didn't know what the fuck that joke was and they wouldn't tell me.  And then it hit like an epiphany.  I'm like, your man's, oh, fuck.  It's a fly.  So it was a zipper joke.  Oh.  I had to learn it myself years later.  What can they tell you?  Because they wouldn't tell me. 
[01:15:30]  Daddy, we're drunk.  Sitting on the couch together.  And I was all happy because they were sitting on the couch together.  So I thought they would, like, oh, good.  They're back together.  Oh, it's going to be a nice, happy family.  You fuck faces.  Your dad just wanted to get his fucking pole tugged.  Oh, that's all.  He's probably horny.  He just wanted a little fucking tap.  He wanted to tap.  And then it back to the fucking fighting.  Oh, God.  Was I just raised in yelling.  Just yelling all the time. 
[01:16:00]  Why the yelling?  Poor little Anthony.  I was just constantly just battered by yelling.  You're yelling now.  I know.  What's wrong with you?  You said you had a great day yesterday.  I did.  I can't enjoy it.  You were in your pool for, like, eight straight hours, you were telling me.  You wouldn't tell me what your man is open.  Good afternoon.  Poor sweetie wanted to know what the man is open meant.  I wanted to know the joke.  I understand.  What's the joke?  It took years for me to figure out that punchline.  It wasn't really a dirty joke or anything.  No. 
[01:16:30]  Don't worry about it.  I'm not worrying about it.  I worry about everything else.  Yeah, you're just a boy.  I'm ready to have an ulcer at fucking six and seven years old.  You're a boy that just wants to learn.  I was a young boy who just wanted to know what the joke was.  You wanted to take in some knowledge.  Yeah.  But see, I grew up to tell my own jokes.  That's right.  And they were a lot dirtier than all the crap I learned in high school.  So there.  There's a spaghetti thrower.  Two flies both landing on.  Why are there flies on me? 
[01:17:00]  Well, shit.  Oh, but just don't argue in front of your kid.  It's just a terrible thing to do to a child.  Why would parents do that?  I don't.  Just argue in front.  Do they even.  They're selfish fucks that would argue in front of the children like that without thinking  it's going to affect them and make them all nervous and scared.  Don't forget back then, too, though, not to defend them, but they didn't know as much 
[01:17:30]  about the shit, like your personality's formed by the time you're two.  They didn't know all that shit in the 50s.  They had to know.  You know something?  I got to go with the school.  Well, they had to know.  You got to fucking know.  You got to think that that's affecting your child when you see him being affected.  You glance over at me and I'm shaking like a fucking leaf.  You got to think that's going to cause something.  Tommy A, stop fighting and treat me.  I'm amazed to think they didn't know.  I'm amazed.  They had to know.  They had to know on some level. 
[01:18:00]  Parents are fucking selfish.  You know, you go two ways when you become a parent.  Like, I had a lot of yelling in my house.  I'm going to go.  I can't yell at my kid because I know what it did to me.  But other people, they have a kid and they got yelled at, so they yell at their kids.  They perpetuated it, yeah.  I think it could go either way, right?  I can't imagine doing the shit that happened to me growing up.  I can't imagine that.  I'm going to do that to my child.  But then what?  Then I don't really discipline them and then he becomes a wild lunatic? 
[01:18:30]  Well, you could discipline your kid, but like yelling at your wife in front of the kid  and getting into some fuck face argument, that's a little much.  You don't want to be a father, obviously.  But let's say you were going to have a child.  Would you yell at him because you were yelled at?  No, I think I'd raise a spoiler. </pre>
