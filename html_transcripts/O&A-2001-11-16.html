<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opens with a furious condemnation of Danny Glover, whom the hosts label a "treasonous traitor" for his perceived anti-American views on Osama bin Laden and the death penalty.  This segues into a discussion of the War in Afghanistan, where they graphically celebrate the killing of enemy combatants, advocate for bin Laden's immediate execution, and mock Donald Rumsfeld's press briefings and the media's coverage.  Their plummeting ratings in Washington D.C. (from first to eleventh place in two months) are met with shock, self-deprecating humor, and calls from concerned (and supportive) D.C. listeners.  The hosts then launch into a promotion of their "Shave Your Bush for Bush" event, designed to show patriotism by linking women shaving their pubic hair to Afghan men shaving their beards after the Taliban's fall. This promotion immediately draws an angry email criticizing it as "sick" and "perverted," met with crude insults from the hosts.

A caller, "Divorce Dennis," details his marital woes stemming from his wife's post-wedding weight gain and resulting lack of sex, prompting insensitive advice from Opie and Anthony.  The hosts then discuss recent subway pushings in New York City, speculating on the motives and offering safety tips, alongside descriptions of eccentric individuals they encounter on their commute.  A heated exchange ensues with Big Chocolate, a recurring caller accused of leaving racist and offensive voicemails.  A brief, pre-recorded appearance by Mick Foley is mentioned.

The "Shave Your Bush for Bush" event becomes the show's central focus.  A t-shirt vendor selling merchandise related to the event comes into the studio, showcasing heavily mocked hats.  Outside the studio, two women from the New York Center for Advanced Hair Removal are live-shaving women's pubic hair, with the hosts providing running commentary. This detailed account includes discussions of various hair removal services (back hair, bikini lines, even inside the ears), client anecdotes, and a listener's disastrous attempt at back hair removal.  A male listener calls in complaining about a sunburn from a mesh hat.  The Crystal Method calls in, discussing their travels, Toronto strip clubs, and a potential live performance.  The ongoing event provides continuous fodder, with commentary on the women's progress and appearance.  Vulgar and offensive language is prevalent throughout this segment.


The on-air and off-air bikini-area shaving continues, with highly descriptive and vulgar commentary on the women's bodies.  Multiple women—Morgan, Mary, Rina, Barbara, and Patty (a show regular with notably extensive body hair)—participate, with detailed descriptions of their physical attributes.  Listener calls, a promotion for Rocco at a Revere Beach club, and a giveaway for George Carlin tickets are interspersed.  Patty's body hair and toenails receive particular attention. Lady Di and Marion, arriving in leather clothing, join the event, though their participation is not focused on hair removal. The hosts express a desire for more women.


The chaotic final segment features sexually suggestive comments about several female guests' physical attributes.  The "shave your bush for Bush" promotion continues, along with discussions of the guests' surgeries. A caller describes an underwear-eating attempt to avoid a breathalyzer, prompting a discussion of heebie-jeebies. A foot surgeon calls to offer services to Patty. A black female caller engages in sexually suggestive banter, describing her body and hair care.  Listener feedback, including humorous observations, concludes the broadcast, along with commercial breaks advertising Neil Toyota and Sam Adams beer.  The entire broadcast is consistently marked by vulgarity, misogyny, and racist slurs.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  We at the Oakley & Anthony Show love our listeners.  Here we go again.  Stupid son of a bitch.  Are you listening to us, you idiot?  Hey, Alex, you douchebag.  All about radio.  Don't listen some more.  Go ahead.  Get everything else wrong.  Shut the f*** up, you dick.  Think about the people that died.  You wouldn't be making fun of it, right?  Well, think of the people that died and wish they were spared so you would die.  But it's a part of it.  You guys want to just make the radio.  Oh, please, God, if you have to make another plane crash, please make a crash on Alex's head. 
[00:00:30]  You're our kind of people.  It's Friday.  Friday.  Hey.  Hey.  How do I get the truck, fellas?  Marijuana is an archaic, medically and legally.  It never did anybody any good and does everybody a lot of harm.  Hey, man. 
[00:01:00]  Say vehicle.  What?  Who's I doing?  Marijuana is the bomb.  Oh, jeez.  I had one to get the eggs, fellas.  Get on your hands and knees like a dog.  That's it.  Fall around like a dog.  No.  No.  Shut up.  And welcome to the Opie and Anthony program. 
[00:01:30]  Hey.  Good afternoon.  A couple phone numbers, Anthony.  Yes.  If you're in the New York area, 877-692-1027.  Anywhere else, including the 137 people that listen to us in Washington, D.C.  Yeah, D.C.  That number would be 866-277-4WOW.  866-277-4WOW. 
[00:02:00]  How are you, Dan?  Very well.  F you Friday.  Of course.  That's right.  I want to send my first one out.  And this one, just in seconds I have gotten this one.  Through Danny Glover.  Danny Glover?  Danny Glover.  What the hell did Danny do to you?  Well, it seems Danny Glover says the U.S. should spare the life of Osama bin Laden. 
[00:02:30]  And said that America is one of the largest purveyors of violence in the world.  So, um, he's pretty much a treasonous traitor on this country.  All because he couldn't get a cab a couple of years ago.  Why doesn't he go live in another country if he doesn't like this one?  Absolutely.  You live with the people that want Osama bin Laden left alive.  Do that, Danny Glover. 
[00:03:00]  Go find a cave in Afghanistan.  There's a few people that agree with you.  And now he's saying, uh, 741 people have been executed in the U.S. since the Supreme Court made it legal in 76.  That seems to be a problem for him.  Uh, the death penalty seems to be a little bit of a problem.  How many, um, of those 741, how many victims are there, Danny?  I love these peace, love, kumbaya, la-la-la people that don't understand that in some cases there's only one way to deal with violent people. 
[00:03:30]  And that is with violence.  To kill them.  Eliminate them.  It's like, uh, it's like if you have cancer and you go to a negotiator to negotiate with the tumor.  They're not, you cut it out.  Or you kill it somehow.  You don't negotiate with the tumor.  But Danny doesn't understand that.  So he's saying we should spare Osama bin Laden's life.  And America, uh, we're just awful people.  One of the main purveyors of violence in the world. 
[00:04:00]  Thank you.  We'll go live in Afghanistan then.  Treasonous traitor.  Yeah, that's some heavy duty talk right there, Anthony.  Yeah, well, you know, I won't watch another lethal weapon movie ever.  I was going to give an F you out to the guys that were trimming trees on the side of, uh, the road today when I was trying to come in.  Well, that's a good F you, too.  You know, treason and, uh, tree trimming.  Treason and trees.  To start the O.P. and Anthony show today. 
[00:04:30]  Didn't he realize all of his movies are chock full of violence?  I don't care one way or the other.  I love violent movies.  I love real-life violence, like we're wreaking havoc over there in Afghanistan, killing some of the, my head, muckety-mucks.  You hear about that?  That Mohammed, uh, what the hell was his name?  One of those Mohammeds.  One of the Mohammeds.  The second in charge?  The second in charge.  Who is now judge.  Seems like he stepped in the way of one of our bombs.  He's judge.  He, uh, he stepped, uh, in the way.  As one of the bombs were coming down. 
[00:05:00]  I hate when that happens.  Ouch.  Gotta leave a bruise.  So I love that kind of violence.  And I love the movie violence.  But if you're gonna be from the school that he's from, of all this, oh, violence, and we gotta, you know, peace, love, uh, understanding, togetherness.  What the hell?  They offer him a paycheck to pull a gun out and start shooting at people in those Lethal Weapon movies.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  I'll, I'll put a, I'll put some, uh, money in my pocket if I have to, uh, act out some violence on, uh, movies, uh, movie screen or TV or whatnot. 
[00:05:30]  Hey, hypocrite.  Another hypocrite.  Um, uh, Anthony?  Yeah.  We will have Osama Bin Laden within a week.  On our show?  Is it gonna be a phoner or live, Rick?  No.  How did you get him?  You're better than Big Kev with the guests.  Oh, we, you mean the military force.  Okay.  And I hope.  I thought Rick was really, uh, stepping up and getting Osama.  And I hope we're smart enough to shoot him dead.  Dead.  Yeah, we were talking about this.  Do not take Osama Bin Laden alive.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  We were talking about this in the office.  The worst possible thing that could be done is for, uh, Osama Bin Laden to be captured and then handed over to the Americans, us, and brought to trial. 
[00:06:00]  Ah.  First of all, you're gonna have a thousand nuts hijacking everything that moves, saying, I'm gonna kill these people unless you release Osama Bin Laden.  Right.  Secondly, you're gonna have, uh, some defense attorney that's gonna have to walk around in a goddamn bulletproof, uh, armor-plated, uh, suit, saying, there's no way my client could get a fair trial. 
[00:06:30]  Everyone knows, uh, this guy and, uh, everything in the press about him.  And, uh, it would just be very, very bad to, uh, bring him to trial.  I think, um, yeah, the bullet.  A little torture, too.  We got our special forces over there.  There's a bunch of people on the ground right now, as we speak, fighting in Afghanistan.  Finally.  They said, uh, troops numbering in the hundreds now, we got over there.  And other countries involved that, uh, will remain nameless for some reason.  They're not fessing up to which countries are involved. 
[00:07:00]  But, um, yeah, I think if they capture him, a little bit of the torture, you get some info out of him, you videotape it, and then, uh, kill him, and distribute it.  Sell it.  Sell it as a package deal with Girls Gone Wild.  Hey, man, this is a great videotape of Osama being killed.  Can I borrow it?  No, my brother.  You gots to buy your own.  Well, the girls are going wild in Afghanistan anyway.  Girls Gone Wild.  In Afghanistan.  Hey.  They are removing their vows for you.  Yeah. 
[00:07:30]  On spring break.  Afghani women gone wild.  I love it.  I smell bit.  Who are we kidding?  We're going to produce a bit?  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  I, uh, I'm enjoying the hell out of Rumsfeld's, uh, briefings every day from the Pentagon on CNN.  Uh, the stupidity, again, of the press just amazes me.  They don't seem to realize that our soldiers are in another country killing people for the greater good. 
[00:08:00]  And they don't, they don't seem to get a grasp on what war is all about.  Um, I don't know what, what, uh, concept they have of war.  But, uh...  Oh, no, they have a grasp.  They think it should be politically correct like everything else in this country.  Right, right.  Even war has to be politically correct.  There is a fine line between, uh, committing atrocities that draw war crimes at the end of a war and fighting a war.  There is a line there.  You can cross it.  Look at, uh, people like a Slobodan Milosevic and, uh, Hitler and whatnot. 
[00:08:30]  Uh, yeah, you can cross a line.  There actually, which amazes me anyway, that there is a line that can be crossed in war.  But for some reason they've hammered out what that is.  Um, what it does not entail is the killing of people.  That's what war is all about.  You kill people until the other side says, okay, stop, you're killing more than we are.  That's what war is.  You destroy their stuff, you kill their people until they say, stop.  And give you what, uh, you want.  And give you what you want.  Well, we are doing that. 
[00:09:00]  We are killing their people and destroying their property.  They have not yet said stop.  They have not yet, uh, handed over what we want.  So we continue to kill them.  The press does not understand this.  When the Taliban is retreating from a city, it is because we are bombing them out of that city.  And we continue to bomb them as they head toward another city,  so we don't have to fight them in that city.  But they don't understand that, the press.  So these briefings, you get Rumsfeld scratching his head,  giving that what-are-you-an-a-hole look to these reporters. 
[00:09:30]  And it's great to watch.  It really is.  I'm so glad this guy's got a set of brass balls  and doesn't buckle under to these ass wipes.  So we got some more clips?  Yeah, let's listen.  All right, here's Rumsfeld.  We are there not because we sought out this activity,  but because we were attacked and we had no choice in self-defense.  And the Afghan people know that.  Second, we tend to leave things better than we found them,  which may not be the case with the Soviet Union.  And therefore, the environment in that country to heave them out 
[00:10:00]  is much more positive in this case than in the prior case.  And furthermore, it's not over.  The Taliban are still there.  A lot of them are going to be in the mountains.  A lot of them are going to be in the neighboring countries.  But we've killed a lot.  Don't get me wrong.  But there's still a lot of them.  That rocks.  He sounds like he would be a nice grandfather to have.  Let me sit on my lap,  but let me tell you about the people we've killed.  Right.  I like the fact that he's saying killed and people 
[00:10:30]  and they're dying and we're bombing and killing  because that gives the reality of what this is all about to people.  When you put it in these military terms of, you know,  extinguishing units and things like that.  No, you're killing people.  It keeps the people straight.  Let's them know what the hell they're dealing with.  It's not our fault.  We were just minding our own business before 9-11.  Exactly.  Exactly.  We didn't go and invade a country.  He was talking about the Soviet Union,  who had their Vietnam was Afghanistan. 
[00:11:00]  You've got to understand,  it was pretty late in the Soviet Union's history.  They were effed already.  We had outbid them on nuclear weapons.  They were going broke.  And they were the invading,  trying to occupy that country.  It wasn't like us going in there  with a purpose of self-defense  with a crappy little government in a place like the Taliban.  So we are doing a great job  and a great thing over there in Afghanistan.  Can we hear more Rumsfeld?  I want to hear some more of Donnie Rumsfeld. 
[00:11:30]  There we go.  But there are reports coming out of Afghanistan  that they are committing atrocities,  that they are killing people,  telling the Arabs who are there  that you can surrender and be killed.  I mean, that's...  Come on now.  Well, that's a report.  It is a...  There's reports on anything you want to find and repeat.  The fact of the matter is  that it is perfectly proper  for the Northern Alliance  and anyone else, including American soldiers,  to tell people either to surrender or be killed. 
[00:12:00]  If you're in conflict,  that is what you do.  And if they refuse to surrender,  as they're refusing to do in Conduce right now,  there's going to be fierce battles  and a lot of people are going to be killed.  Do you believe the guy said,  is it true that people are saying surrender or be killed?  It's...  It's war!  Surrender or die!  Oh, my God!  It all comes back to the political correctness  in this country of ours, Anthony. 
[00:12:30]  Just the fact that you get a guy asking a question like that,  he's outraged  because it seems that some Northern Alliance soldiers  are saying surrender or die.  And Rushmore's like, yeah, they are.  And American soldiers are saying the same thing.  Yeah.  Oh, my God!  What an idiot!  This is part two to that question.  Yeah, this is a good one.  Second,  it is a misstatement of fact  to say what you said.  The reports are saying.  There was some looting  as the Taliban left in Kabul, 
[00:13:00]  I am told.  I am told that the...  a relatively small number  of the total Northern Alliance forces available  went into Kabul.  They stopped the looting.  I don't doubt for a minute  that there are people dead in there.  But the Taliban killed people  as they were leaving.  We have no information  that suggests that there has been  the kind of thing you've cited  on the part of the forces going in.  Indeed, the bulk of the forces  have stayed out of the city  to avoid that. 
[00:13:30]  And I think it is  unfortunate  if people  fling around  rumors and allegations  about behavior  that are not demonstrated,  not proved,  and in my judgment  thus far  not factual.  That's great.  He was like giving that guy  a little jab  to fling around.  What do you fling?  Crap.  You fling crap.  Flinging around rumor.  I heard your wife's a whore. 
[00:14:00]  You want to answer that,  Mr. Reporter Guy?  Yeah, he's great  when he gets up there.  He don't take no guff.  I think he would say guff.  Anthony, is this true  Burtis from Instant Feedback?  How about a John Holmes  size FU to France and Germany?  You want to send troops  to Afghanistan now?  Yeah.  We already beat those  sea-faced monkeys  back to the Flintstones.  Now you want to help us?  Now you want to help us?  Well, I think a lot,  for the most part, 
[00:14:30]  they were told  to just kind of hang back.  You know what I mean?  We didn't even have  many ground guys in there.  I think we wanted to just  give the Northern Alliance  a lot of support,  let them do what they want to do.  But now I am very happy  to see that we're throwing  more of our guys in there  to help mop up  and make sure  that something else  doesn't slip in there  that's worse than the Taliban.  Kevin, you're next  on the O.P. and Anthony show.  What's up?  What's up, fellas?  You guys remember  earlier on when they started  with the cluster bombs?  Of course.  The retarder reporter 
[00:15:00]  asks, he says,  well, what's the point  of dropping these cluster bombs?  And Lumsfeld pauses  for a second  and gives them that  you effing tool look  and it says,  well, the whole point  of dropping these bombs  is to kill people  on the ground.  To kill people.  It's a cluster bomb.  The reporter can go  to a website,  put in a cluster bomb  into Yahoo  and get a whole thing  on what cluster bombs do.  They kill people.  They don't knock out  electronics.  They don't do this.  They're not something  that takes out a runway.  They are there  to kill people.  They should give  Rumsfeld a taser. 
[00:15:30]  Every time one of these  stupid questions  comes his way,  he just shoots the taser  in their face.  Just let them bam.  Like the United Airlines  pilot.  Look at Kurt from Jersey.  Mr. Rumsfeld,  there are reports  confirmed by a reliable  source inside Afghanistan  that U.S. troops  are armed with guns.  How do you respond to that?  And is this the type  of message we should  be sending the world?  That's great.  What an idiot.  What a bunch of tools  these reporters are. 
[00:16:00]  But there's the latest.  Second in charge,  Judge.  Judge.  He's Judge.  Yeah, he seems to have  been where one of the bombs hit.  Now, they're saying  Osama bin Laden,  it's reasonable to believe  that in the very near future  we might get this guy.  Less than a week,  my friends.  Less than a week.  Which would be great.  Oh, public humiliation.  This guy Dennis is saying  don't kill bin Laden.  You can't make a show  out of it.  We would all love that.  Someone made a good point  on the answer feedback. 
[00:16:30]  You kind of just  make him go away.  Just make him disappear.  All of a sudden  he just disappears.  But let everyone know.  Maybe not even let  everyone know.  Oh, I gotta know.  I gotta know.  I can't be...  I think we need to know  but make it look like  maybe he's just a pussy  and he ran away.  Hmm.  Yeah, instead of making  him a martyr.  Yeah, well that's the worry  a lot of people are saying.  You're gonna make him  a martyr if you kill him.  You know, martyrs are only good  if there's people left  to look at him as a martyr.  Yeah, have Gary Condon  make him disappear. 
[00:17:00]  Make him his intern.  There you go.  Look at all this  witty Washington humor  we're giving the people today.  Oh, that ought to help.  This should help the ratings.  Woo!  Man.  How about those  Washington ratings?  I hope they pull  their reserve chute  before they hit the ground.  Thanks for the support  Washington.  Gee, thanks Washington.  I don't think people  jumped off the Titanic  this fast.  My God.  Jesus.  We're in a free fall.  Phew. 
[00:17:30]  We are free falling  in Washington D.C.  Anthony.  Listeners fleeing  the area.  They're fleeing.  Running for their lives.  Wow.  God, Washington.  I thought we had  a relationship here.  I thought we had  something in common.  I thought we were  feeling each other.  You know, we...  You lost a part  of the Pentagon.  We lost the Twin Towers.  I thought we were all  kind of relating there.  Wow.  Yeah, someone dropped  a daisy cutter 
[00:18:00]  on our ratings.  On Don and Mike's ratings.  That's what happened.  And you know what?  If we don't  turn it around,  I think you and I  are going to get  some bunker busters soon.  We're going to be  bunker busted.  What did we do,  Washington?  Why 10 Stevens?  What did we do  to you, Washington?  That you should  abandon us  in our time of need.  Oh, yeah.  There's no secret.  A little ratings thing  came in today.  And, oh, yeah.  There's a free fall  going on. 
[00:18:30]  Wow.  Let's go to  Steve in Washington D.C.  I hope you've got  to keep your head up.  We're going to turn  this thing around.  We're going to  turn it around.  We're going to  turn it around.  Go to your toolbar.  Steve, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How's it going?  Where's your agony?  Pretty good.  Hey, don't worry  about the Washington  Rage.  Well, of course  you're going to  worry.  Never mind.  Look, you guys  have got a decent  fan base down here  and we're trying  to spread the word.  JFK is really  trying to do a good  job of promoting you  guys.  Things are going  to turn around. 
[00:19:00]  Just give it a  little bit of time.  You have a great  show.  You really have  a great show.  You suck, but  you have a great  show.  Well, thank you,  Steve.  Thanks.  That makes us feel  good.  You guys, seriously,  you rock.  You want me to fax  the paperwork we  got in today?  Oh, my God.  In two months, we  have taken the  afternoon show in  Washington from  11th place.  No, from first  place.  From first place.  First place to  11th.  First to 11th.  First to 11th in  two months.  I'm looking at 
[00:19:30]  it positively,  Opie.  They had one  one.  We have two  ones next to  each other.  So we're twice  as good.  We're twice as  good.  Two ones.  They only had  one one.  We have two  ones.  Dan from  Hoboken with  a little history  lesson.  Washington hasn't  seen this much  of an exodus  since the British  burned it in  1814.  Thank you for  the history  lesson, Dan.  Hey, guys, take  care.  All right, Steve.  Hey, Steve, tell  a friend.  Tell a friend.  Wow. 
[00:20:00]  Yep.  Yeah, it looks  pretty bleak.  Gloria.  Yeah.  Gloria.  Gloria.  Yeah.  You're on the  radio, man.  Hello.  Hello.  Um, just letting  you guys know  that I'm also  from D.C.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And adding one  more to your  list, okay?  What?  You had said  that there was  137 listeners.  137 listeners.  Oh, we're up to  137?  No, add one  more, 138.  All right.  All righty? 
[00:20:30]  Well, thank you,  Gloria.  Thank you.  All right.  Bye-bye.  Bye.  Yeah, so that's  the latest.  Yeah, they've, uh,  they're fleeing.  They're fleeing  our show.  Hmm.  At least we can  fall back on our  ratings in other  cities, right,  Anthony?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What a week we  had, boys and  girls.  Yeah, yeah.  Seems like the  only city that, uh,  doesn't like the  news is Cleveland.  Thank you, Cleveland.  Cleveland is a  city that cares  less about what's  going on in this 
[00:21:00]  country because the  news station there  didn't get that  big pop and, uh,  people are still  hanging out with  ONA.  We should reward  Cleveland for, for  not caring about the  news.  Yeah, Cleveland  just stood by the  ONA show.  That's all they  needed, uh, for  their news was  Opie and Anthony.  They didn't need  no pesky, they  didn't need to flee  to a pesky news  station in their  city like everyone  else did in every  other city.  Thank you, Cleveland.  They can't be 
[00:21:30]  bothered with, with  stuff like, uh,  world news.  Right.  Thank you, Cleveland.  Well, thank you, uh,  see you next Tuesday  from New York.  Next thing you know,  the ONA show will  be buying time in a  Vietnamese station  after the Grishman.  You suck.  Water doodly.  And, uh, make sure  you go down to  Bob's Rib Shack.  So, thank you,  Cleveland. 
[00:22:00]  The only positive  sign this week.  Yeah.  Cleveland was  there to, uh,  pat us on the  head.  As every other  city spanked our  ass.  We understood, we  understood that New  York would have been  freaked out with  everything that went  on.  Yeah.  Even D.C.  D.C.?  Well, D.C., they  got a hit too,  Opie.  It's impossible to  go from first to  eleventh in two  months.  Hey, we did it.  All right, that's  how good we are.  We did it.  Two ones is one 
[00:22:30]  more bet.  Should we throw  ourselves a party or  something?  Eleventh.  First to  eleventh.  That's not even the  bottom, man.  Oh, I know.  No, I predict we  will have to sink a  little further before  we make our little  comeback.  Our triumphant  return?  Yeah.  Mm.  All the years of  hard work Don and  Mike put in to get  to number one in  afternoons in  Washington, D.C.  And we effed it up  in like a month.  Two months, dude.  Oh, my God.  I'd like to 
[00:23:00]  personally apologize.  Wow.  They seem to be a  little angry.  Well, you know,  what can we say?  Seems like people  don't like change.  It happened.  They were in  first place for  quite a while.  We come rolling  in and effed it  all up.  Was Oswald in a  nearby window as  your JFK ratings  drove by?  Yeah.  That's Kevin  from the  pre-side. 
[00:23:30]  Thanks.  Don't feel  bad.  You're hearing,  so that's good.  What?  Everyone's trying  to, everyone in  Washington is saying,  keep your chin up.  Keep your chin up.  We're going to  turn this thing  around.  We're going to  turn this around.  Well, we're going  to have a lot of  people listening to  us today, Anthony.  Or your tool bar.  How many ladies  have shown up for  our big promotion? 
[00:24:00]  Give us some good  news, finally.  Come on.  None.  Stop it.  No one's here?  No, we got the  girls here that are  going to do the  hair removal.  We can talk to  them next.  Well, the one has  really nice boobies.  Well, these are two  new girls.  We want the old  girls with the one  with the...  Well, you don't  know what the new  ones look like.  These are hot, too.  All right.  And they're going  to be doing the  shaving today?  Yes.  Well, today is the  big day.  We start Shave Your  Bush for Bush to  show your support 
[00:24:30]  for America.  Hey, someone's got  to get an email  that's on the  printer.  Some lady is  really pissed off  at us that we're  doing this today.  Why is this?  This is very  patriotic.  A lot of the  people in Afghanistan,  the men in Afghanistan,  shaving their beards  because the Taliban  used to make you  wear a beard,  whether you wanted  to or not,  in Afghanistan.  And now that  Kabul has been  liberated,  the people shaving  their beards off.  We figured we'd  do what we could  here to show our  camaraderie with  these people and  shave our women.  There you go.  It kind of does  two things.  The women were  able to unveil 
[00:25:00]  themselves in  Afghanistan, and the  men could shave.  So we want to  shave our women  unveiling their  womanly attributes.  There you go.  Who's pissed?  Who could be  pissed at that?  Well, the email's  coming, but we had  about 20 or 30 women  that said they would  show up today, and so  far we have none.  Mr. Rumsfeld, is it  true that you'll be  using a sharp razor  on these women?  Don't be a dick.  Ladies, we had a  really, really bad  week, and we don't 
[00:25:30]  beg often, but we  could really use some  cheering up today.  A lot of women said  they'd show up.  So if you show up  and do this for us,  we'd greatly  appreciate it.  We'll give you a  beer, and we'll  give you a t-shirt,  and we'll feel  better about  ourselves.  A lot of women  said they were  going to show up.  Okay, here's the  email from Jamie.  You guys are  effing sick.  Having women come  in to shave their  warrant for  America, for 
[00:26:00]  Afghanistan, or  just for your own  twisted, perverted  eyes to see.  You are all  pathetic losers  who have no,  God, the commas  are all in the  wrong place, Jamie.  You are all  pathetic losers  who have no lives,  and you must be  desperate to have  to run boob  promos and have  a shaving promo.  What's the matter?  Your wife's not  giving it to you?  Not married,  douche.  Ugh, imagine  being married to the  likes of that  twat.  I don't blame them.  I wouldn't give it  to my guy if he  wanted and drooled 
[00:26:30]  over every other  woman.  If he was as  perverted as you  guys, I wouldn't  even give him the  time of day.  Think of the  poor son of a  bitch that has  to live with  this drone.  Get a effing life  a-holes.  Imagine that  poor guy,  probably wants to  have a little  fun maybe.  Maybe, you know  something?  What's her name?  Jamie?  Jamie.  Let me fill you in  on something.  Your husband's  banging other  women.  He has to be.  There is no way  a guy sits back  and can't fulfill 
[00:27:00]  himself sexually  with his wife  and doesn't  go out and  bang other  women, Jamie.  Doesn't happen.  If you're that  much of a prudy  ass that you  just lay on  your back and  that's all you're  giving your  husband, he's  fantasizing about  other things and  he's doing other  things because  you're not giving  it to him.  Maybe he has a  little kinky edge  to him and if  you fulfilled that,  it'd make him  happy.  But no, you  sound like a  prudy stick in  the mud.  Sew up that  worthless slot. 
[00:27:30]  Oh my God.  Anthony, we're  supposed to try  to turn it  around.  We're trying to  turn it around.  Turn this  around.  Go look at  your toolbar.  We're trying to  turn this around  for the people.  Sorry.  Let's try to  turn it around.  We're going to  turn it around.  Barbara, what's  going on?  Barbara.  Barbara.  Hello?  Barbara.  Barbara.  I can't hear you.  I'm sorry.  I can't hear you.  You can't hear us  because you're  listening to the  radio. 
[00:28:00]  Turn the radio.  No, I don't.  I have no  radio.  My girlfriend  was talking  too loud.  I'm sorry.  What's up?  We're on our  way right now.  We're in the  limo.  We're getting  all liquored up.  Hold on.  Usually when  that happens,  you turn to  your person  that's next  to you in  the car and  go, can you  please shut  up?  I'm trying  to make  a phone  call.  Barbara, you're  on your way  in a limo?  Yep.  We have four  girls in a limo  and a bald guy.  We're getting  liquored up.  We're on our  way.  Where are you  coming from?  Right now, we're  on Palisades  Parkway, so  we'll be coming  over to the  George Washington  Bridge in about  10 minutes.  Where are you 
[00:28:30]  coming from?  Rockland County.  Are you strippers?  Are you regular  girls?  What are you?  I actually did  the celebrity  softball game  for you guys  last year with  Hot Wax Jill.  Oh, cool.  All right.  We'll see you in a  little while,  all right?  All right.  Thank you, Barbara.  Bye-bye.  Bye.  There she goes,  Anthony.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Washington listeners  fleeing like the  Taliban from  Kabul.  There you go.  There's another  great analogy.  You don't want  to, they're  fleeing faster  than the Taliban.  All right.  Why don't we  take a break, 
[00:29:00]  okay?  All right.  Steve from Boston.  Now you guys  know how the  Red Sox fans  feel.  Very good.  All right.  Man needs  underwear to  beat breathalyzer.  Yes, all right.  We'll get to  all this fun stuff.  Shave your  bush for bush.  Yeah.  Very patient.  We'll talk to  the ladies that  will be doing  the shaving.  Don't worry,  we're talking  about other  things today as  well, so stay  there.  Hello, this  is Mick Foley,  the most  disgusting,  ruthless wrestler  in WWF history  and a respected  beloved children's  author, and  you're listening  to Opie and 
[00:29:30]  Anthony.  Have a nice  day.  1027 WNEW.  We are Sports  Guys, Blaine and  Craig, Morning,  Don and Mike,  Midday, Opie and  Anthony, Afternoon,  Ron and Fez at  night.  We are 1027 WNEW.  You're checking  out the Opie and  Anthony show on  this FU Friday.  Thank you for  listening.  Can't thank you  enough.  Don't want to  lose you too.  Not you too.  You too. 
[00:30:00]  Remember yesterday,  Anthony, the cherry  darts for the  Xbox?  Yeah.  We have some  videos and some  pictures available at  foundrymusic.com.  Oh, good.  They will make us  remove the  pictures.  Well, maybe not  though.  Who knows?  Go to  foundrymusic.com and  check out what we  were doing yesterday  on the radio show,  okay?  Yeah.  There's a link off  of opiananthony.com  to get there.  Well, remember  Divorce Dennis, I  think his name was? 
[00:30:30]  Yeah.  He thought he was  going to get...  What was his  story?  Hold on.  He had a wife.  She lost 14 pounds  to fit into her  bridal gown in  July and has  since made up the  weight.  And we said it's  always bad if the  girl has to lose  weight to fit into  the gown because you  know it's snapping  right back.  And then, since  you're married, it's  just going to keep  going and going.  And Dennis told  this story on the  air and then he  participated yesterday  and he's on the  line now. 
[00:31:00]  Dennis, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Hey, man.  First off, did you  get the pictures I  sent to you?  Of what?  The pictures you  took yesterday?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, I got to go  through them still.  All right.  Well, if you see  the one about the  couch, that's where  I'll be sleeping  for a while.  Uh-oh.  Why?  What happened?  Well, first, she  came in just after  I did before I had  a chance to put  away the T-shirt.  She's like,  what's that about?  So I told her  what happened and  first tears welled  up in the eyes  because I said I  told the whole  world she was fat.  You didn't put it  that way to her? 
[00:31:30]  No, no, no.  But that's the way  she interpreted it.  Oh, we kind of  hinted at that.  You just said that  she lost weight  to get into her  wedding gown.  Right.  So she started  crying.  And then the anger  came out.  And she said,  well, I hope you  got a good look  at that Xbox  because that's  the last box  you'll be seeing  for a while.  Oh, yeah.  So the holdout.  And then she's  holding out on  the pooh-ah.  No pooh-ah for you.  Like, I'm already  not used to that. 
[00:32:00]  Oh, no.  Are you kidding?  Since July,  you're kind of used  to not getting any?  Oh, it's brutal.  And I want to  send an F you  to every married  guy out there  who never said  that that stereotype  wasn't true.  Oh, no.  Come on, dude.  How long were you  going out before  you got married?  Two years.  Two years.  And how many times  did you have sex  a week on the average?  It went from  like three or four  down to now  it's about once  every one and a half  to two weeks.  Oh, man. 
[00:32:30]  And I always just  say to her,  you know,  I don't condone  when men cheat  on their wives.  But I understand.  But I understand.  But I understand.  And that didn't  go over well either.  Wow.  That's pretty bad.  Tennessee,  you want us to  just call your wife  and tell her it's over?  I mean,  you're kind of like  pussyfooting around  the whole thing.  No, no, no, no, no.  Aw, footing.  I mean,  why don't you  shut your trap?  You're just digging  yourself a bigger hole here.  Well, every time  she says something  it gets me angry  and then it goes  back and forth  and the next thing  you know,  you're saying  things you shouldn't. 
[00:33:00]  It's called marriage.  And then she remembers  it,  you forget it  and she throws it  back in your face  about two months later.  Boy,  just July.  Since July  you've been married,  huh?  That's amazing.  Since July  the sex has drastically  dropped  and she has gained  a lot of weight back.  Well,  not a lot of weight.  What happens  when you go to bed  there's no like,  you know,  you're grabbing  and then sex.  Until they turn  to grab me  it's like,  I've had a long day.  I need some sleep.  Like,  I work too.  Yeah,  Jamie's on the line. 
[00:33:30]  Your wife,  I believe.  Jamie.  Oh.  Oh,  stop it.  Hey now,  that's not right.  That is not funny.  Anthony,  I'm pretty convinced  that that wasn't  actually Dennis' wife.  Oh,  of course it wasn't.  Smartass.  So,  Dennis,  you're going to be  on the couch  all weekend,  huh?  At least.  This is a two-weeker.  Well,  you might as well  come in today.  A lot of girls  coming down  to get shaved.  Oh,  maybe I will.  Can't get in  any more trouble.  Might as well.  Open door.  If you want to show up,  come on down. 
[00:34:00]  Thanks,  guys.  All right.  All right.  Bye,  Dennis.  Bye.  Oh,  you bitches.  You bitches.  It's the bitches  that are bitches.  It's the bitches  that are bitches.  Chuck,  what's going on?  Hey,  what's up,  guys?  Hey.  Hey,  Opie,  I just wanted to talk  to you for a minute.  Yeah.  I want you to know  that your fans have your back  and that,  you know,  you do have a problem  so it's not your fault  so you can admit  where you were  if you were at  Grand Central Station  yesterday around 730  getting on the subway.  Are you implying  I really got to do  when I saw the story?  Are you implying  Opie may have pushed 
[00:34:30]  that woman in front  of the subway?  I don't want to imply  anything.  In a fit of anger.  Opie needs to recognize  this problem on his own.  Well,  we had another,  yeah,  lady that was pushed  in front of a subway train  yesterday.  Oof.  For some reason,  people like doing this  in New York City.  I don't get it,  but I don't understand  how you could get pushed  in front of a subway train  myself.  Well,  if people stand  on that platform,  they peer over.  There have been people  that have actually  stood on the edge  of the platform,  peeked over  to look for the train, 
[00:35:00]  looked in the wrong direction,  and got hit  in the back of the head  by a train.  How does that happen?  How do you get hit  in the head with a train?  In the back of a head.  In the back of your head.  In the back of the head.  No,  I did not push  that poor lady.  Well,  I'm glad to hear it.  I do have,  if Dennis is still listening,  I have some advice for him.  I've been married  for two years myself,  and if my wife  ever pulls the crap  where she's too tired  or had a long day,  what usually works  is if you roll her  on her stomach  and dig your forearm  into the back of her neck  and just have your way  with her,  that usually works. 
[00:35:30]  And usually,  you know,  she'll be happy  to accommodate you  from then on.  Okay,  terrific.  Okay,  you guys are awful.  Thanks, Chuck.  I just think there's  a thing that goes on  in bed  that if it's not going on,  there's some trouble there.  When you get into bed  with your significant other,  there should be  a lot of contact  going on,  you know,  on a nightly basis.  Regardless of if  you're banging every night,  there should at least  be some fun contact.  There should be a yank.  At least a yank.  A yank.  At least a little reach 
[00:36:00]  around when you're  spooning.  A little yank.  Yank.  A rub in a tug.  A little yank  or maybe a poke.  Should be at least  one poke  and one yank a night.  I just picture this one.  Poke around a little bit.  I just picture this one  curling up  back to the guy,  you know,  and he's probably  no angel  in this whole thing either,  you know?  Back to back,  opposite sides of the bed.  It's over, man.  Cut your friggin'  losses now.  I don't understand.  Make it like 
[00:36:30]  one of those phone calls  I hope he just hangs up  on in the middle of it.  You don't see it coming.  Wham!  Over!  Spared you  minutes of displeasure  and agonizing  trying to figure out  what the hell  he's talking about.  Same thing with marriage.  Boom!  Over!  Except for me,  I can't hit the button  for two years now  and hang up on mine.  Oh, man.  Getting back to the subway thing  though really fast.  Yeah.  You gotta look around.  You gotta look around  for the kooks. 
[00:37:00]  You can't be on the edge  of that platform  looking for the train coming.  It's rarely a guy  in a business suit  with a briefcase  that pushes you  in front of the train.  It's always,  what are these things?  And you're like,  well, this is a kook.  Let me not get  this guy behind me  while I'm standing  at the edge of the platform.  There are too many people  that are trusting  in this city.  Yeah.  They just casually,  you know,  bend way over the platform  to, you know,  strain their neck  to see when that train's coming.  There have been comedians  that have done bits on this.  It's like you almost, 
[00:37:30]  you want to be  politically correct.  You don't want to be  afraid of mental illness.  You don't want to be racist.  You don't want,  so instead of  maybe moving out of the way  when one of these gentlemen  comes near you,  you stand there.  And you pay the consequences  sometimes.  You know what I mean?  And this woman  was a little too close  to the edge of the platform.  Some kook ran up  behind her  and pushed her  into the oncoming subway.  It's a sad story,  but I don't know. 
[00:38:00]  I know where all the kooks are  at all times, man.  Yeah, you got to have  your kook radar on.  The commute is the same  every day.  Yep.  I see the guy  that sings the Beatles tunes  over and over again  as he walks in circles.  I see the guy that...  Harmless?  That one's harmless.  But you wouldn't take a chance.  Then I see the guy  at the bottom of the subway steps  over there near Macy's  who begs for change  and cries.  But you see him  an hour later  and he's a very happy,  jovial guy  just walking the streets. 
[00:38:30]  He makes believe  like he can't walk  and stuff.  Oh, and he sits there crying?  And then you got the lady  that wears the glad bags,  has clothes.  I know where she is  at all times.  But all these people  potentially dangerous  when they really...  The blind Violetis  who's actually not blind.  He's got to be blind.  He's not blind.  I saw him reading  on the subway.  I told the story  on the air.  Braille?  Huh?  It wasn't Braille?  No.  This guy who's been  collecting change  on one of my subways  for the last three years.  Yeah.  You see him  once a month maybe 
[00:39:00]  and comes on  feeling his way around.  Yeah.  His eyes are like this.  They have problem offices?  His eyes are like this  and he bumps into people  a little bit  and then he finds a spot  in the subway.  Yeah.  And then he starts  playing the violin  and he makes a bloody fortune.  Wow.  I saw him off hours one day.  How does he know  where he's going?  I guess it don't matter.  He's got the stick and stuff.  I mean,  how does he know  what train he's getting on  and where it's going to?  He's got the blind prop.  The blind prop.  He's got the prop.  The cane.  Yeah.  But I saw him off hours one day  coming from downtown. 
[00:39:30]  There he is on the subway  and I'm like,  holy S,  the guy can see  he's reading a book.  He's in character.  He's acting.  He's reading a book.  But I know where  all my kooks are  at all times.  You've got to know  where they are.  It's like,  uh-oh,  Beetleman is getting  a little too close.  Because any of them  at any moment  can discover,  have a moment  where they realize  what situation they're in  and realize the situation  of the people  that are going to work  and earning a living  and kind of get angry  and maybe hurl one of them 
[00:40:00]  in front of a subway train.  You don't want to be that guy.  I even watch myself.  I want to make sure  where I am at all times.  Well, yeah.  I'm sure you're a kook  in someone else's.  Oh, there's a guy  that was punching  the token booth  the other day.  I just don't want him behind me.  I just want to be aware  at all times.  I want to make sure  I don't push myself right  into a subway.  Grab the back of your head  and flip yourself over  into the train.  Got to know  where the kooks are  at all times.  Got to.  Opera man,  you don't know  what he's capable of doing. 
[00:40:30]  You think opera man  could be violent?  Huh?  You never know.  You know what?  He seems like more  a regular guy  than a kook.  He looks like a nut  because he sings opera  right outside of our building.  He was kind of the inspiration  for Adam Sandler's  Opera Man on SNL.  That's what they say.  Is that really true?  I don't know.  He just stands there.  He is so loud  and he's got this  Oh!  We've been trying  to get him on the show  but for some reason  we've got to just  get audio of the guy.  He leaves it like  Yeah, but we should  Why don't we go down  before two, Rick? 
[00:41:00]  With a little dab recorder.  He has a can  and he takes change  but when he's singing  some of these notes  he looks like a nut.  His face gets all distorted.  He sucks.  He sucks.  He's singing on the corner, Rick.  He's not even good.  Alright.  And then you've got  the bird lady  a little further down  that basically has a pigeon  living on her head  no joke.  Yeah, bird lady.  And she has like  you know the cardboard  that like the cases come in  and the delis and stuff?  Uh-huh.  She has an empty one of those 
[00:41:30]  and that's where  you throw your change.  Yeah.  So.  Chad, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, fellas?  Hey.  Hey, when you guys  coming to Cleveland  we support you  through the news  and all that.  I need you guys out here.  We give you guys  major props today  and we gave you guys  major props yesterday.  It seems Cleveland  is the only city  that doesn't care  about the news  and stayed with us  through all these  Yeah, we love you.  Through all these  troubling times.  Did you guys see  the Victoria's Secret  show last night?  You know,  I did not see it 
[00:42:00]  but you're going to say  it was awesome, right?  The only thing  that was wrong  was the cameraman  and cut out  on the girls  too quick  to go to another shot.  Well, someone else  said it sucked  because they were  they were fuzzing out  the nippy region.  Yeah, all the good outfits  you couldn't see the goods.  You know, that's crap  because I've seen  the fashion shows  on VH1  when you're going  through the channels  and you're like  oh, there's pretty much  a naked chick  walking down a runway.  Let me watch this.  When they walk back  into the dressing room 
[00:42:30]  you want to see the thongs?  You wouldn't show them.  You know, CNN  would do those fashion shows  and then VH1  a bunch of them  and man,  those were the best  cheap thrills.  Yeah.  They'd show up  pretty much  nude women.  You'd be flipping around  and all of a sudden  they would have those  models parading  the runways  and it's like  oh my god,  they're topless.  Yeah.  They're just about topless.  You can see everything.  They better not  take that away  from us too.  That was a nice  cheap thrill on it  like Sunday afternoon  or something.  I think they did.  I love those  snotty runway models.  Don't they just look  like bitches on wheels? 
[00:43:00]  All right, Chad, thanks.  They make that face  like they're just  a complete bitch.  They're all skinny  on heroin.  And they just got  that snotty look.  They're naked  and they don't care.  I love it.  Oh, Christ.  What does he want?  Big chocolate.  What's up there,  playboy?  Playboy.  How do you feel?  What do you want?  I want to sing  another hit song of mine,  baby, for the country.  Hit song, huh? 
[00:43:30]  Your last one  was so good.  How's my favorite  white African brothers  doing?  Hey, big chocolate.  What's up?  We spoke to,  what's his name  out there?  Chris.  Yeah, kid Chris.  Yeah, yeah.  I was still listening, man.  He played me out.  He didn't play you out.  What he did  was he was being honest.  He said,  you've been saying  that you've been  on his show,  you have your songs  on a bunch of stations,  he's one that  plays your parodies.  And then we called him up  and said,  no, he's a joke.  I played it as a goof once. 
[00:44:00]  Let me tell you this.  Kid Chris used to  call me here  every other day,  not every other week  to come on his morning show.  And that is no lie.  Every other week  he would call me here,  big chocolate at night,  midnight,  come on my show,  come on.  So don't let him  sit up there  and BS you guys.  He was sweating me  at one point big time  from March to July.  Big chocolate,  shut up.  Shut up.  All right, go ahead.  I ain't buying  any of your crap.  Hey, 24 radio stations  around the country, baby.  I've been doing morning shows  and giving you all props  in different cities.  Well, we don't need  the props from you.  That's why our ratings  are dropping you 
[00:44:30]  out in the country.  Shut your trap.  Dan from Hoboken,  you want more listeners  in D.C.  and you play big chocolate.  Smart move.  Take it easy now.  Take it easy.  Show me some love now, baby.  Now, you're leaving messages  on Rick's answer machine  on a daily basis  and you're like  faking like other voices  and stuff.  That wasn't me.  I don't know who that guy was,  but somebody was calling up  a doggy named Vinny, right?  Why are you being defensive?  I didn't even say  there was a guy named Vinny  that called Rick, did I?  Well, Rick told me.  No, I didn't.  I haven't talked to you,  you tool.  He left messages to me.  So you are Vinny the guinea. 
[00:45:00]  Huh?  You're Vinny the guinea now, too.  I'm not Vinny the guinea.  Some guy Vinny the guinea  is calling up doggy me, man.  No, you're Vinny the guinea  and you're calling Rick.  You're trying to get  this whole thing going on.  I don't know  who that ravioli bastard is.  Hold on.  This is the message  that was left on Rick's machine.  Hey, Opie, Anthony,  how are you there?  This is Vinny the guinea.  Listen, last week  you had a very funny show.  I don't know,  you had some big  freaking moulinon on there,  some chocolate bastard  or whatever there.  Listen, I'd like to hear  that watermelon-eating  and fried chicken-eating bastard 
[00:45:30]  on again, all right?  Those are some very funny songs there.  And he made me laugh a lot.  All right?  He made me laugh a lot.  So I don't know.  Let's put him on again  sometime soon there  and just tell him  to watch this stuff  with that white boy talk there,  you know what I mean?  Send him back to Africa  with a spare rib  shoved up his a**, all right?  So let's get that moulinon on again,  that eggplant-eating bastard,  whatever the F's name is,  big talk to you, all right? 
[00:46:00]  All right?  Opie, very good.  Anthony,  you linguine and clam sauce-eating bastard,  let's get him on again, all right?  Capisce?  Bye-bye.  Oh, my God.  That is so obviously Big Chocolate.  Hey, like Jackie says,  it wasn't me, baby.  Oh, Big Chocolate,  that is so obviously you  with all these racist remarks.  I know y'all think  all black people look alike,  but we don't all sound alike, babe.  Dude, that was you.  Big Chocolate, we caught you.  At least admitted you.  It wasn't me.  Not only does your voice  sound identical to his, 
[00:46:30]  but the whole way you talk,  the kooky way you talk,  is the same as that guy.  You are the same guy.  I would come down there today  and while the girls are shaving my bush  for birth,  shall take a polygraph test.  Oh, please.  You know,  can I come down here  and shave my bush today or what?  Oh.  Think I'll hook a brother up?  No.  Big Chocolate,  admit that that was you.  Huh?  Admit that that was you.  I don't know a guy named Vinny.  Rick left a message here  that some guy,  Vinny called.  Dude,  I haven't even called you,  you tool.  You know what I mean?  Rick,  you my man, 
[00:47:00]  number one producer in the land,  right?  Jesus Christ.  Oh, my God.  Good.  There goes Big Chocolate.  That guy,  did you,  that was the first time I heard that.  It's so obviously him  and he's saying all these  racist remarks there.  What's New York,  New York?  That's his brand new song.  Frank,  Rick,  Big Chocolate.  Another hit of mine,  man.  Sure to piss a lot of Yankee fans off.  Tell me if Owen,  they like this one.  New York,  New York,  Sinatra.  Start spreading the news. 
[00:47:30]  I'm on the Opie and Anthony show today.  And you can hear it live or on tape delay.  I love married women,  of course.  After they meet me,  they always get a divorce.  When they find out I'm packing 14 inches  and I'm hung like a horse.  So ladies,  if you can keep a secret between us,  I've got the world's largest chocolate. 
[00:48:00]  And you've heard it live in New York  or in old New York.  Da,  da,  da,  da,  da,  da,  da,  da,  da,  da,  tell me what Owen they think,  man.  I just did that one later.  Oh my God.  He's,  he's insane.  Oh yes.  That was really funny though.  In a really sad way. 
[00:48:30]  Oh yes.  Okay.  Did,  um,  did you read that instant feedback?  Is that why you hung up on him?  No.  Someone wrote,  now it's time for one of those quick hangups.  Oh really?  Stu from Philly.  Oh no.  This is the perfect time for one of those quick hangups.  No,  I got the perfect timing for that.  Oh my God.  I don't need help.  I don't need help with that.  What a tool.  All right.  Pathological liar.  All right.  Why don't we take a break and get the,  the shaving girls in?  Any,  any,  uh,  uh,  girls that want to be shaved here yet?  Yeah. 
[00:49:00]  They're upstairs.  They're coming down right now.  Oh my God.  And this is going to work after.  Nice.  Holy ass.  We were just goofing.  All right,  cool.  We'll,  we'll make it happen.  Ernie up from Jersey.  How many syllables does this guy add to songs?  Start spreading the news.  I'm on the OPN Anthony show.  Hang out.  I'm going to be there.  And they're going to play my talk today.  All right.  How about an ass?  Uh,  Donna.  Yeah.  What's up?  Um,  I just like,  can't make a comment.  I've been listening to the station and they're talking about,  you know,  all these guys being married and their women ain't putting out. 
[00:49:30]  Why is it any different when the men don't put out?  Absolutely.  I,  you will not get an argument here.  Uh,  men that,  uh,  get home,  uh,  lazy bastards and they,  they just sit there and they don't give their women some loving.  They could,  uh,  expect their women to go out and get the,  the sea they so desperately need.  I mean,  they're sitting there,  you know,  saying,  oh yeah,  well,  you know,  she's a bitch.  She's a bitch.  I mean,  you know,  for days it's like I'm going through withdrawals.  Hey,  she was a bitch,  that woman. 
[00:50:00]  Okay.  I mean,  I didn't hear the whole thing,  but you know,  it's not all of us.  There's a lot of guys too.  Absolutely.  Well,  like I said,  you won't get an argument from me,  Donna.  You sound kind of drunk.  Yeah.  Are you getting the sea on the side there,  Donna?  No.  You've been,  you've been drinking this Friday.  Maybe later.  It's too early.  You've been smoking some weed.  No.  All right,  Donna,  we'll let you go.  All right.  Have a good one.  She's right though.  Of course it's,  it goes both ways.  I just,  we weren't taking a call from a woman talking about our guy. 
[00:50:30]  We're talking to a guy talking about a chick.  And then we got that email from that woman.  That was describing a bitch on wheels.  Anthony?  Yes, me.  Yeah.  Shave Bush for Bush.  I can't wait.  Starts next on the Opie and Anthony show.  As we go to break,  why don't we go to the FU line and see what's going on today.  Okay.  Does this sound familiar,  Boston?  Holy S.  Hey,  thanks for calling.  And here's the Opie and Anthony FU line.  Yeah.  Here's a big FU.  FU to work. 
[00:51:00]  Cause I'm here on a Friday night dealing with this BS.  Because nobody else in my company knows what the hell they're doing.  So FU to everybody out there who doesn't know what the hell they're doing at their job.  Because you're just a bunch of fricking losers.  Next message.  Yeah.

[00:51:30]  for the guy at work  who bitched and complained  and whined and moaned  about my W.O.W. sticker  on the back of my van at work.  FU Frank,  you big,  fancy,  jerk off,  underground,  saggy.  End of message.  Hi, we're here.  We're here under your skin.  Us two a-holes.  Hello.  Opie and Anthony.  1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W. 
[00:52:00]  Our new fall lineup is  Sports Guys Mornings,  Don and Mike Middays,  Opie and Anthony Afternoons,  Ron and Fez Nights.  We are 1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W.  And you're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show,  7-Dust.  Freeze.  A couple phone numbers  in the New York area,  877-692-1027.  And for anyone else  outside of New York,  including Washington.  Yeah.  Including the few people  that are listening in Washington. 
[00:52:30]  Hello?  Anyone in Washington?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello, Washington?  Are you there?  Hello?  Do we have that new technology  where we can actually hear  the different cities  that we're out there in?  Let's pot up Washington.  Go ahead.  All right.  Here we go.  Hello?  There's got to be someone out there.  Hello?  Washington.  Hello?  Hello?  Why don't you use your megaphone?  Maybe we got to wake him up?  Hello?  Washington? 
[00:53:00]  Washington?  Washington?  Are you there?  Anyone?  Hello?  No.  Nothing.  All right.  866-2774.  Wow.  If you're outside  the New York area,  today on the show,  it's Shea Bush  for Bush Anthony  showing your patriotism  and support  for our troops.  We got a lot of girls 
[00:53:30]  outside the studio now,  Ant.  They are arriving  like crazy now.  I see that.  Pretty hot chicks.  Not a brain between them.  Oh, look at that.  Hey, and the T-shirt  have arrived.  T-shirt guy.  T-shirt guy.  Where are you?  Get on the mic there.  Hey, what's up?  Yeah, you can go on the mic.  Hey, man.  There it is.  Oh, yeah.  I'll be wearing this.  Shame your Bush.  He's got the hat.  Dude, I hate these type of hats.  You're not wearing  one of these hats.  What do you think?  I'm going to give you  a $40 hat.  I understand. 
[00:54:00]  These are those puffy,  like the front of the cap  is foamy.  You know, it's like  that foamy stuff  and then the back  is the netting.  It's half mesh  and then a little space  in the front  to put your logo  and you're saying,  know who wears hats  like this?  The guys at the VA.  Right, right.  They love these.  I was just going to say.  Look at the retarded kids  at the amusement parks.  That's all right.  I think the staff  of fast food restaurants 
[00:54:30]  because, you know,  they can wear that.  Right, Stink?  Would you wear  a half mesh hat?  Mesh hats are in now.  Yeah, this is in.  With the little plastic,  look.  Yeah, yeah.  It's got one size fits all  kind of thing.  Oh, my head's  a little too big.  I better move it up  a notch  on the back here.  Let me open mine up.  Yeah, Cam Neely  and Dumb and Dumber  wore one of these things.  And look how stupid  he looked.  That's great.  All right.  So, well, 
[00:55:00]  thanks for the mesh hat.  We'll hang it up  in the office at least.  It's good to remember  this fine day.  You can catch fish in them.  You know,  we're making fun  of your hats,  but I love the T-shirt design.  Yeah, that's great.  It says,  shave your bush  for Bush  and it has  an American flag  and on the back  it has one of our  fine WOW bumper stickers.  I believe that's  going to be  a collector's item.  There you go.  Right, Ant?  Oh, sure.  This will be like  part of  wartime memorabilia  in the future.  I think for you guys.  You guys are the greatest.  Anything for you. 
[00:55:30]  Do you know  how popular  right now  a World War II  logo T-shirt  would be?  Did they have  any back there?  Just imagine  how popular it would be.  Years from now  they'll look back  and go,  here was a sign  of the times.  This was during  our Afghani campaign.  Hey, Pops,  I got a hat for you  to wear at the VA office.  Thank you.  Hey, my Pop  is not that old.  No, you see these things  whizzing by  on little rascals.  Hello there, Bleach.  Shave your boots  for Bush. 
[00:56:00]  Give it to him.  Stick it to the Kaiser.  Well, I'm going to  put my hat on it.  Tell me how good  I look in this.  Hey, that looks good.  No, you want to take  a picture of that?  We'll get that Tojo.  We'll get him  and Hitler, too.  The T-shirts  are awesome, though.  They really are.  You do good work, man.  You should get a plug-in.  Well, you know.  No plugs.  No plugs.  Look at that.  No plugs.  No, dude.  I like that.  You take care of us,  we take care of you. 
[00:56:30]  We've always been that way.  I know you're being cool  and you don't want to do it,  but do it.  I don't have nothing to plug.  Don't you want to plug  the T-shirt shop?  It's okay.  No, maybe he can't.  Exactly.  Maybe he should.  Oh, right.  You made these shirts  after hours.  That rules, man.  I got you.  There you go.  Word up.  We used to call that  side work.  A little side work.  In air conditioning  and heating,  it meant pilfering equipment  from the shop  and getting a job  on your own. 
[00:57:00]  That's why.  All right.  This is why.  Wow, you're one of those guys?  What happened?  Figure it out.  Let me see.  You're one of these guys?  Can I say anything?  This is too good.  No.  Let me see.  That's campy, you.  It is.  Wow.  Let me see.  All right.  When did you get a haircut?  It makes me want to order curly fries.  When did you get a haircut?  Curly fries.  A couple of years ago.  A couple of years ago?  Why? 
[00:57:30]  Hey.  All right.  Here's a little bit of this one.  You're assimilating a little bit?  Have you...  This morning.  Have you given up on...  Totally.  You have?  Yeah.  But you were hardcore for a while.  That's obvious.  Wow.  You've got to get a new picture  for your license.  No, that's what...  No, that's keeping this picture.  All right.  Why?  Does that help out  when you get pulled over?  Forget about it.  Yeah?  They're laughing to let me go.  They laugh and they let me go.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Let them be.  All right.  There you go.  That's cool.  Fred, what's up?  Hello, yeah.  Yo, guys. 
[00:58:00]  Hey.  I went to the beach  and I wore one of those hats.  I shaved my head  and I caught a burn  through the hat.  Yeah.  It looked like the Spider-Man logo  all over my head  for a week.  It was burnt in.  Spider-Man.  Don't shave your head  and wear one of them things.  Half mesh hats  never cool.  Never.  Never, never.  I don't care what it says  on the front.  Never cool.  Why don't you hang up?  All right.  Why don't we get  the shavers in here, Anthony?  We've got to get going here  with the shavers.  Bush for Bush.  There's a little guy  that works at the building 
[00:58:30]  I live in.  His name is Yubi.  He's a little guy.  He's got to be about...  He's kind of old  and he's about,  I don't know,  four feet tall.  No way.  He's not four feet tall.  I swear to God, dude.  You've got to see this guy.  When you say four feet,  meaning five feet?  No, I mean four feet tall.  Four feet tall.  Yeah, he's a little guy.  He holds the door open  and whatnot.  And he wears a mesh hat.  The thing is,  he's bald  and he puts the mesh hat on  and it adds about  three to four inches 
[00:59:00]  to his height  because it just sits  on his head  and you can see  straight through the mesh.  Like, you see the top  of his bald head  and then straight out  the other side.  Mesh hats always just sit  on top of your head.  I know.  You can't do anything  with a mesh hat.  I don't like  the mesh hat myself.  Nah.  Hey, girls.  Hey, Owen A.  How you doing?  Great.  How are you?  Wow, you girls are lovely.  Aren't they attractive  girls there, Opie?  Wearing very sexy tops  and everything.  Yeah.  Thanks.  Yeah.  So you guys  will be doing  the shaving today? 
[00:59:30]  We will totally  be doing the shaving.  Absolutely.  Blonde and brunette.  Very nice.  Now, where are you guys from?  We're from the New York  Center for Advanced Hair Removal.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  You must see  some horror stories, huh?  Well, you don't even  want to know.  This is not, look,  not so bad.  This is the company  that shaved down Patty.  Yes.  Yeah.  Balloon knot at all.  You did Patty's boobs  because Patty had some hair  growing around on her boobs.  They did more than her boobs.  They went balloon knots.  You just come to me 
[01:00:00]  and down.  We'll take care of you.  Any hair, it's gone.  Dude, I think I just  like blocked that  out of my head.  They did.  They did her balloon knot.  Live on the air.  They did her.  We did.  We do it a lot.  The taint, everything.  The taint area.  And gave her a little  waxing.  It's called cilia.  When are you two coming in?  Yeah, when are you guys  coming in?  We're waiting for you  to come in.  I don't have any pesky  hair I want to remove.  You guys do guys?  Yeah.  Absolutely.  I got no back hair.  I got no...  You're lucky.  I got no, like,  unwanted hair, really.  Then you are lucky. 
[01:00:30]  Absolutely.  I'm fine.  I mean, look at me.  Yeah.  I'm fine.  Yeah.  Do guys just lay there  naked and you remove  hair and stuff?  Absolutely.  Sometimes, sure.  We do a lot of backs.  We do a lot of...  We do a lot of backs.  We do some...  We do chests.  We do arms.  Do you do, like,  ears and stuff?  We do inside the ear.  Inside the ear.  You do, like, eyebrows.  Absolutely.  Whatever you do.  I like...  I've noticed, like,  sometimes I get, like,  a wild hair just growing  out of my eyebrow.  Come on in and we'll...  But no, I just...  I clip it. 
[01:01:00]  A lot of guys don't clip  those.  They let them go, man.  And you see what happens?  You end up like that  Whipple guy on...  George Whipple.  Yeah.  You see that guy,  New York One?  Yeah.  Here in New York?  He's got...  I swear to God,  it is like big cotton candy.  Oh, they're caterpillars.  Caterpillars.  Too big caterpillars.  Caterpillar eyebrows.  On his eyebrows, yeah.  We can take care of that.  My hair cutter,  he took the razor  right to my eyebrows.  Does he do that?  I'm like, oh, man,  I'm getting old.  He went...  He went...  Remember the old days?  But Whipple bangs young chicks. 
[01:01:30]  Well, who knows?  Whipple doesn't bang old.  Yeah, we do.  We saw them.  Young chicks.  It's a beard.  So what happened  to the other two ladies  they usually send down?  Dana and Natalie?  They couldn't handle  our abuse anymore?  Exactly.  Is that really true?  No, no, no.  Dana's actually running...  We love those two.  No, Dana's running the office  and Natalie actually,  she just had a baby.  Which one?  Was she the one  with the real nice boobs  we used to make fun of?  No, I think that was...  I don't know.  Natalie has the blonde hair.  See, we're going to enjoy  you guys as well,  but I just hope  they're not mad.  We have nice boobs. 
[01:02:00]  Yeah, there you go.  I'll tell you one thing,  you are really pulling off  that Jennifer Aniston thing.  Do you like it?  Yeah.  I think it's the whole  Friends thing.  You got the Jennifer Aniston...  She's got the look, too.  Haircut, you know?  You can't see her.  Her face looks like her, too.  She's from Hartsdale.  We have another location now,  too, in Long Island, as well.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, uh-huh.  For those hairy Long Islanders.  Yep, hairy Long Islanders.  In Oyster Bay.  Come on down.  Oyster Bay.  Oyster Bay.  My word.  We're in Oyster Bay.  I've got to get some  of my back hair removed, lovey. 
[01:02:30]  Lovey, lovey.  Yeah, you see a bunch  of the professionals  over there in Oyster Bay  coming in.  We see them all.  We see a little of everything,  actually.  What's the most?  Like, what's the most area  you work on on people?  Like, the one that you get the most.  Back from men.  Back from men.  You know something?  And bikini for women.  And bikini for women.  How the hell  do you get rid  of that much back hair?  Because I've seen guys  that, like, they're at the beach  and they take off their shirt  and they're wearing  a big woolly sweater.  We work magic.  Be surprised.  Really? 
[01:03:00]  We work.  Our own Steve  from foundrymusic.com  once tried to shave his back.  He tried using Mujan,  that stuff that rips the hair out.  No, no, none of that.  I swear to God,  it looked like an L-1011  landed on his back.  Get Steve in here.  It was just...  You got to see Steve's back.  It looks like he's wearing  a sweater when he takes  his shirt off.  My friend Joseph T. Curry,  by the way.  Oh, my God.  He is the hairiest back,  like, in the shoulders.  It just goes right around  the front. 
[01:03:30]  This hairy guy.  Tell him to come in.  We'll take care of it.  What do you do to get rid  of all that hair?  We use an epilite.  I mean, it's basically...  It's not a laser,  but it's actually...  It's an intense pulse light system,  and it kills the hair  at the root.  So basically what happens  is after you...  Does it ever grow back?  It grows back finer and lighter,  but it really doesn't come back  like how you have it.  Yeah.  I mean, it takes about six treatments.  Six?  About six,  and then after six,  they're ready for the beach.  Does it hurt?  You know what?  It doesn't...  It doesn't hurt at all.  Believe me. 
[01:04:00]  It's like a little bit of a snap,  but for what it does,  it doesn't hurt at all.  Yeah.  What?  What's that Steve saying?  Steve goes,  what are we talking about?  I love when I can surprise people  a little bit, Steve.  Oh, Steve,  we're talking about you.  Come on in.  You know these ladies?  Yeah.  They look familiar.  I think they're the hair removal  chair.  They do their hair,  and we were just talking  about your hairy back.  Oh, great.  We told them about  your Mujan experience.  That sucked.  Steve,  can you show them your back?  I want to see  if they can take care of you.  That's all.  He had major surgery  in the front,  so he's a little shy.  No, he's not even...  Are you shy about the front? 
[01:04:30]  No.  He had his stomach stable.  Check that out.  I love it.  Let me see that, Steve.  Look at that score.  That's fairly anything.  By the way...  Wow, you're losing  a lot of weight.  By the way,  Skinny has lost 35 pounds.  I know.  35 pounds.  In one month.  All right,  take off your shirt.  Show them your back there.  Take it off.  And would you be able  to do something about this?  Holy ass.  You should see  what we see.  That's not bad at all.  That's not bad?  No, it's not that bad.  You know what?  Just the only thing is  is around that big tattoo 
[01:05:00]  that you have there.  Yeah, what's the deal  with the lasering  and the tattoos?  We're going to have to...  I mean,  if you don't want it to change,  we're going to have  to cover that tattoo.  Ah, well,  then it's pointless  and I'm going to have  a patch shaped  like my tattoo.  Well, we can get  right around it.  Right around it.  That sucks.  And then have a hairy patch.  Why?  You can't put something on it  that...  You can have a hairy tattoo.  You can have a hairy tattoo.  We can choose it.  That sucks  because it's a female tattoo.  I like my tattoo.  What is the tattoo of again?  It's a...  What is it?  Let me say it.  Yeah, it's a hairy...  It looks like a hairy chick.  Oh, my God.  It's a girl  and now she's all hairy. 
[01:05:30]  She's got hairy legs.  You didn't think  when you got that tattoo,  my brother?  I was not.  I was not thinking.  We've got to explain.  It's a really hot lady  riding a guitar  and she's got very long legs  and they're very prominent.  Her arms are up in the air  in the tattoo  so now it looks like  she has hair on her arms  and all over her legs.  It would definitely be interesting.  It looks like she's playing  one of those old ZZ Top guitars  that were all, you know,  whatever.  The rage.  So what's the effect 
[01:06:00]  if you laser the tattoo?  Well, it could get  a little lighter potentially  and I'm...  Lighter isn't bad.  Some of our clients  don't want it to get lighter  so we protect it.  But I mean...  You've seen worse than that?  Absolutely.  It's like you can make  a sweater out of that hair.  No, it's not that bad.  That's nothing.  That's easy.  One, two, three,  an hour, you're out  and then you'd be on the beach  with no hair on your back.  And how long will it last?  It's permanent.  I mean, it's...  Steve, you want to go down there?  Yeah, I'll go down there.  Absolutely.  Yeah?  All right, do it up, man.  Yeah, absolutely. 
[01:06:30]  We'll do it for you.  And then we can report back  and then, you know,  we'll do it before.  What a testimonial.  You're going to have to do  a before and after picture  for the website.  You got it.  That's fine.  Before and after picture  for us, too.  Don't forget.  We're located in Heartstale.  Not hard to find.  What's some of the most...  Like, as far as...  We know what women like  having removed there,  but as far as men go,  have you had some  really embarrassing things  where guys will come in  and go, yeah?  Absolutely.  Some balloon knots.  Get them.  Yeah.  They come in and just say,  could you remove the hair  from my back door?  You know what happens 
[01:07:00]  is a lot of men complain,  and I don't understand this,  but a lot of men complain  of profuse sweating  in that area.  So, they sometimes  want to...  It's called cranky ass.  They're buttocks.  Maybe.  Guys, sometimes  they get the cranky ass.  Call whatever you want to call it.  I want to ask these ladies  something, Anthony.  It might be a little embarrassing,  but I got to know.  What's the style  on guys these days?  The front...  What's the number one style?  Yeah.  What are the guys  doing these days?  It's short and shaved.  Short and shaved.  I hear now, 
[01:07:30]  at least a couple of years ago,  very popular,  the porn star,  yam bag,  shaved completely bald.  No, that's not...  Well,  own personal opinion,  that's not true for me.  You don't like that?  No, absolutely not.  But what are all the guys doing?  Are they shaving it all down there?  Sometimes, I mean,  yeah, we've seen it.  That only happens  during drunken nights  and you wake up feeling silly.  Yeah.  You wake up and go,  ah, I'm a nine-year-old boy  for a few weeks at least.  It works for the women,  but not so much the men sometimes. 
[01:08:00]  Yeah, the wood floor  on the man  is just like ridiculous.  You're like a kid  with a big mule  and a low-hanging yam bag.  Man, guys are coming  out of the woodwork.  They want their backs shaved.  Sure.  Send them over.  Guys don't like that.  You don't like having  a hairy back, I'm sure.  We might have to do it.  We might have to do...  It's basic radio,  but we might have to do  the hairy back contest.  Hairy back.  We might have to do it.  Especially with these ladies  saying that Steve's not that big. 
[01:08:30]  He's not that big.  I look at Steve's back  and I'm like,  that's a lot though.  I know I'm not.  There's a couple of patches  on the sides of the spine,  each side of the spine  up in the upper half of his back.  It's nothing.  It's nothing.  We've seen covered like a rug.  Basically like a bear.  You know, from the neck  all the way down.  But like Armenian guys?  My friend,  please get rid of hair,  my friend.  And it's gone like  from his cheekbones  all the way down  to his knees.  Absolutely.  We've seen it all. 
[01:09:00]  Please, my friend.  There's nothing we haven't seen  or treated.  Really?  Did you ever just have a guy  take his shirt off  and you would go,  oh, like inside,  you're just like,  not to his face.  No, don't do his face.  No, no.  Well, you know,  I know you don't want guys  to be intimidated,  but the truth of the matter is  they probably know it anyway  that they would come in.  The truth of the matter is  some people are hairy  and some people are really hairy.  These girls talk  at the same time.  I love it.  They're like twins  separated at birth.  They finally got to meet  and then they finish 
[01:09:30]  each other's thoughts.  That's great.  We work well together.  All right.  How many ladies are out there  getting ready to get shaved?  About four or five.  And are we taking their pictures  to the website  as they disrobe and stuff?  Nice.  All right.  We're going to talk  to some of the ladies  that are getting shaved  to help the cause today, Anthony.  Isn't that great now?  You're going to be helping  a great cause here  and bringing awareness  to our situation  in Afghanistan.  I love New York.  What will you ladies  be using to get the job done today?  We have buzzers.  We have razors. 
[01:10:00]  We have scissors.  We have it all.  That's great.  We just don't have our epilite  because that's in Hartstale.  Oh, that's okay.  And in Long Island.  It's all right.  All right.  So we'll start the shaving  next, Anthony.  Yes.  Any ladies that want this done,  you just have to show up today  between now and 7 o'clock.  Okay?  Right.  All right.  We'll be back.  Stay there.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Own it close, baby!  Woo!  Woo!  Yeah.  Sure.  And we're back  with the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:10:30]  Very excited, Anthony.  Oh, yeah.  Shave bush for bush  is about to get underway.  Fantastic.  We have five or six ladies  getting ready, so to speak,  to show their patriotism  for this fine country of ours.  Yeah, you saw the men  in Afghanistan, in Kabul,  after the Taliban was gone.  What's the first thing they did?  They shaved off those beards  that the Taliban  had ordered them to have.  And the women uncovered themselves,  showing their lovely Afghani beauty. 
[01:11:00]  You know, I want to go  one step further  with this concept, Anthony.  I'm encouraging all the gay guys  to get rid of their beards  as well today.  Oh, you mean the women  they hang around with  so their friends  don't know they're gay?  Well, sure.  Shed your beards.  We don't care what the beard is.  A girlfriend on your face  or a clam.  We just want you to shave it.  Get rid of your beards.  Right.  Stacey from the city.  Ivy was probably coming down  for the show today  but got lost in the elevator. 
[01:11:30]  Yeah.  Ivy, of course,  the target from yesterday's show.  Yes, and quite the target she was.  I must say,  we had a fine week of radio.  A lot of fun.  And a lot of the pictures  are up on foundrymusic.com  for now.  We always give you pictures  of the festivities  going on here.  And I want that goddamn  live cam fixed.  I'm going to start  racking some head, Opie.  You know, I usually lay back.  I'm pretty much the mellow one  when it comes to  behind the scenes around here.  I'm going to rack some head.  You know, that is a problem, 
[01:12:00]  by the way,  because they expect me  to break stuff in here.  Yeah.  Man, you start breaking stuff,  people will freak out.  And watch what they get  done for us.  We had great success  with the stinky cam  a while back.  We'd have something  going on in the studio.  We'd turn on the stinky cam.  People could log on at home  and see a live feed  of what was going on here.  And then for some reason  it stopped.  They said they were  updating software.  This is months ago.  I want this taken care of  today.  That'll get our ratings up 
[01:12:30]  right.  The stinky cam.  Matt, what's going on?  Hey, man,  we're just sitting back here  in Washington.  You got a lot of fans  down here.  We're trying, man.  We're trying.  I've been spreading the word.  I've got my boss  listening to you.  I've got my son  listening to you.  Well, uh...  There's two.  Hey, whoa.  Hey, watch the line.  Hey, hey.  Hey there.  Hey there.  Well, that's her problem.  You know, we're pretty honest,  though.  We got a ratings report today  and, uh...  Oh, there's a free fall  going on in Washington, D.C. 
[01:13:00]  That's what I heard.  Want to call you.  Hey, did you all see  all the bikes up in New York  last weekend?  Uh, what bikes?  There's bikes every day.  Well, there were a bunch of us.  There was 2,000 of us bikers  down here in Washington  that got together  and had a police escort  all the way up to Ground Zero  last weekend  just to support New York.  How cool is that?  Well, thanks for that.  Yeah, it was a really good time, man.  Rumbling up.  Uh, there was 2,000.  We had a police escort,  like I say, all the way up  and we stayed the night,  Saturday night,  and then went to Ground Zero  on, uh, Saturday.  Did you bring your old ladies  with you?  Well, some people did. 
[01:13:30]  Most of us, uh, smart ones  left them at home.  Right on.  With their tattoos,  property of chainsaw?  No, mine's a property of grumpy.  Did you guys have  the banana eating contest?  Uh, been to a couple of those.  Actually, they're  hot dog eating contests.  Right on.  Uh, do you F your women  into your club?  Don't belong to a club  on that one.  You F them in?  You ever hear about that, Opie?  If a chick wants to be  your old lady,  you gotta bring her  to the clubhouse  and all the guys F her.  That's the guy's girlfriend.  It's called F and her in. 
[01:14:00]  Is that really true?  Yeah.  And then some,  some of the guys  they beat in  and some of the women  they, uh, uh, uh,  the, the, the, uh,  word for, um,  the, uh, liquid.  They, that you in.  I, I hear you.  Right.  Everyone gathers around  in a circle  and they, they do that.  Well, if that's the case,  there's a lot of  five lambs in Geneseo  that are, uh, in.  That are in, yeah.  All right, Matt.  All right, thanks a lot, man.  We'll keep listening down here.  All right, Matt.  Peace. 
[01:14:30]  Hey, we gotta go  to the phone really fast  and then we'll talk  to these lovely ladies  that are gonna get us  going with the, uh,  Shea Bush for Bush thing.  Yeah.  It's Kenny.  Kenny!  Hey!  From The Crystal Method.  What's up, man?  What's going on, guys?  Where you guys been?  Uh, we just got back  from, uh, Toronto.  Hey, Kenny, can,  wait, can I start with this?  Mm-hmm.  Kenny, if I call you guys  Crystal Method,  does that mean, like,  I'm out of touch  and I, and I don't know  what I'm talking about.  What else would you call us?  Well, I got a bunch of email  because, you know,  we're big fans of you guys  and we got along  when we were hanging out  backstage there in, uh, Boston 
[01:15:00]  and we've been supporting you guys  ever since, uh,  the Boston thing  and, uh, I say Crystal Method  instead of The Crystal Method  and I got a few emails  from people saying  you're a loser.  It's The Crystal Method.  I'm very sensitive.  Uh, whatever.  You can call me  whatever you want.  He doesn't care.  See?  There it is,  right from the guy.  But they're giving me  a lot of crap  over the word thought.  Hey, the funniest thing  is like when people  from our own record label  who we haven't met before  they go, hey,  hey, are you Crystal Meth?  Yeah.  Crystal Meth.  Whatever. 
[01:15:30]  Yeah, you forgot the UD.  Just Crystal Meth.  What, you want some?  Crystal Meth OD.  You were, you were in Toronto, huh?  Yeah, we spent records  at this, uh,  Xbox launch party thing.  Oh, that's cool.  Yeah.  A bunch of geeks  playing games.  Well, Toronto's a great city, though.  Did you catch any of the, uh,  the boobie bars?  Toronto is fantastic.  Best strip clubs  pretty much in the world.  You know what I don't like  about the strip clubs  up in Toronto, though?  What's that?  It's false advertising.  You're outside  and they show all these 
[01:16:00]  lovely hot girls  that I think I'm going to see  naked in there.  Uh-huh.  Um, because it's totally nude.  Uh-huh.  But only a couple of the girls  get totally nude  and it's not those hot girls  I saw outside.  It looks like a Da Nang village,  uh, where we got naked  and got on the stage.  Well, let me just tell you.  I went to the wrong places, yeah?  Canadian ballet is unbelievable.  Uh-huh.  You haven't been to  the Brass Rail, then, I guess.  Is that the good place?  The Brass Rail in Toronto.  I love the names.  You just know  you're going into a strip club.  The Brass Rail. 
[01:16:30]  Isn't that that seafood joint  up on the top?  The Brass Rail.  But you know what?  While I was there,  I saw, I saw,  we saw like a,  the small, like,  out of the waist strip club  I'd never been to.  We didn't have time  to check it out,  but the sign said  couch dances  and face dances.  Face dances.  And I was like,  I'm like so dying  to know what that is.  I have never heard  of the face dance.  I can only imagine.  Is Norton there?  What is it?  No, unfortunately,  he would see,  he would know.  Norton would absolutely 
[01:17:00]  know what a face dance was.  Norton will be back  Monday, I believe.  Yes, he's getting  the yellow discipline  somewhere up in, uh, where?  I think he's in New Hampshire.  New Hampshire.  Are you guys  shaving bushes today?  Yeah, we're doing  a shave your bush for bush.  You see, you saw  the Taliban chased out  of Kabul  and then all the people  shaved their beards off.  So we're kind of,  you know,  any, any way we could  loosely tie together  something to get  women in here,  we do it.  You know,  all, all women  for themselves  should shave.  Yeah.  Well, little do they know  how much more, 
[01:17:30]  um, how much,  you know,  more oral  they will get.  Oh, right.  Once shaved.  It's, it's so true.  Isn't it a treat  when you realize  there's nothing down there?  It is just like heaven.  You don't have to worry  about looking,  looking like your cat  on the back of the couch  going,  cock, cock, cock,  with that hairball,  that choking,  because we all know  there's no swallow  in that hair.  No matter how much  you try,  you don't want to make  a scene like you're  digging something out, 
[01:18:00]  but then you don't  want to keep it in there.  And everyone,  I think,  has tried the swallow  technique once,  and it just stays.  It's like trying to  swallow a goddamn chicken.  It ain't happening.  Pain in the ass.  Hey, Kenny,  we got four of the ladies  in the studio.  They're all beautiful, man.  You should have been here today.  I wish I was there.  Yeah, where are you right now?  I'm in, uh,  like our management  company office.  I'm looking at,  uh, you know.  What state?  Yeah, let's trade.  No, what state are you in?  Oh, I'm in California.  Oh, California. 
[01:18:30]  Okay.  I thought maybe  if you're in New York,  you'd come on by.  I would be there.  When are you going  to be in New York?  Uh, you know what?  We were scheduled  to be there for one day  just this last Monday.  We were scheduled  to fly into JFK.  Uh-oh.  Oh.  See that?  So we postponed that trip,  but we're going to be  coming out there  real soon to re...  We're going to tape,  uh, tape some request  show or something  on MTV2,  so we'll be out there soon.  Hey, you've got to come in.  I have a request.  Yeah.  Can you guys be like  the house band one day  on our show?  I would love to do that. 
[01:19:00]  Just set up outside the studio  and as we're going to break  and out of break,  we just, uh,  have you guys do your thing?  I would love to do that.  You would make our day.  That would be really cool  and we would have more  booze for you guys.  Yeah, we'll make...  Even a match.  We'll make sure there's  plenty of, uh,  boobs and booze.  You didn't stop drinking.  If you did,  then you can't come.  Boobs and shave booze.  Boobs and beer for you guys.  All right.  Well, no,  we'll have to do the Dr. Pepper.  Oh, the Flaming Dr. Pepper  is so good.  I felt like crap  the next day.  Oh, me too.  It was such a great memory.  Like, it was one of those 
[01:19:30]  good hangovers  because I was hanging out  with you guys, you know?  It was a fun night.  You want to have your ass kicked  when you wake up  in the morning like that.  Absolutely.  A lot of fun, man.  All right.  Well, we'll let you go, bro.  Hey, great talking to you guys.  All right.  Yeah.  Like we said,  when you're in New York,  get in here.  Hey, listen.  Listen, Ben is going to call you.  We are dead serious.  We'll set up all your equipment  and we'll let you guys  do your thing.  Lots of booze.  We'll do the Flaming Dr. Peppers.  We'll have ourselves  a fine party, all right?  Let's try to work it out.  All right, cool.  All right.  Hold on the line for one sec.  I will. 
[01:20:00]  Ben's going to talk to you.  Ken, thanks, man.  All right.  See you guys.  It's Ken from Crystal Meth, man.  Crystal Matthew Tool.  From C-Method, yo.  Those guys,  we just hit it off in Boston.  We had a great time  with them in Boston, man.  Like, when they first  came on the show,  we were kind of like,  I hope they're cold  because we've been in circumstances  where guys get on here  and they kind of don't get our show  and it's a little awkward.  And they don't want to get our show.  And they don't want to, yeah.  Because their management's like,  look, you've got to do  20 interviews today.  Yeah.  And here's the next one  and they just want to get through it. 
[01:20:30]  They're just another  in the long line  of radio dicks bags  that have to interview these guys.  But they walked in,  they saw us all drinking beers  and were like,  cool beer.  Can I have one?  Like, okay,  we're going to get along just fine.  Yeah.  And we were hanging that night  and the Flaming Dr. Peppers  were fantastic.  Oh, now we're looking at boobs.  Wait, girls are flashing in here.  Wow.  What, what, what?  Hold on.  I wasn't invited.  You weren't invited.  You don't need an invitation  to take your top off.  Well, look at you.  What?  Who got this started? 
[01:21:00]  Come on.  You got it started.  That's right.  You did.  All right.  These ladies are here to,  you know,  for the Shea Bush for Bush thing.  Yeah.  We got to be careful  how we describe it.  Shea Bush for Bush.  Even though it's a very patriotic thing  we're doing today  for this fine country of ours.  It's support for our troops  and our president, yes.  So who do we have in the studio?  Oh, hi.  I'm Barbara.  Hi, Barbara.  Morgan.  Morgan.  Morgan was in our  whipped cream bikini contest.  Oh, no.  She came in second place. 
[01:21:30]  Second place.  And she's all pissed off at me.  No, no, no.  I'm not.  You were, then you said,  I was in Hawaii anyway.  You were pissed at me  and then I said,  I had nothing to do with it  and then she said  she was pissed at you.  No, it's the audience voted.  Somebody didn't like my fake boobs.  Wait, wait a minute.  The audience voted on that.  They didn't like them.  They said they were too big.  No way.  Well, let's take a look  at your fake boobs.  Those are perfect.  Those are very nice.  Those don't even look fake.  Hey, why don't all the ladies,  you know, take their tops off  so we can just compare between...  Why don't we just take  all our clothes off?  Well, that is a great idea. 
[01:22:00]  I'm coming from Stilettos, Emanuette,  so we get our clothes off.  Stilettos?  We'll say Stilettos  a million times if they're naked.  And we got Janine there this week.  Who's Janine?  The Triple X.  Oh, all right.  Oh, I'll be.  Stilettos, Emanuette, New York.  Okay, cool.  She's awesome.  You guys are awesome, though, man.  Yeah, but I'm jumping on stage with her.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, I could only imagine  the hygiene saddle in suit.  We can do the whipped cream contest 
[01:22:30]  right at Stilettos.  She's going to jump on stage  and recite some poetry with her, isn't she?  Yes.  Why are you covering up?  You're cold.  I'm cold, too.  It was very nice.  Oh, they're all cold, Anthony.  There you go.  Here you go.  That's good.  Oh, yeah.  There we go.  She's lonely over here.  She needs some help.  I don't look like that.  Oh, they're all cold, Anthony.  They all come in different shapes and sizes.  Maybe you ought to get all your clothes off  and huddle together for warmth.  No, we're going to get shaved.  It's even better.  Whoever turned up the A.C.  should get a raise. 
[01:23:00]  Yes.  I know someone did that for us today.  Thank you.  To make sure we got all the hair off.  What?  It's a visual thing.  What's wrong, ladies?  You all right?  I think the ride home is going to be much fun.  I think all the guys should come to Stilettos  and check us out tonight.  Wait, you guys are going to mess around on the way home?  You guys...  Yeah.  Alcohol and...  Oh, you're the limo girls at Cole.  Uh-huh.  From Stilettos and Manuetta.  Yeah.  And I'm from Lace, so...  Oh, you're from what?  Lace.  Where's Lace?  Right by there.  Nyack.  Nyack.  They're owned by the same.  Same guy?  Mm-hmm. 
[01:23:30]  Ah.  Great guy, Glenn.  Glenn.  Glenn's the best owner.  Oh, jeez.  You know, we're going to get paid for this.  Glenn, we love you.  All right.  We're going to do the best.  Yeah.  Ladies stay in school.  Okay.  So, are you ladies ready to get the job done, and then we'll check it out when you're done?  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right, Rick.  If you would take them outside and get started.  Are these the only ladies showing up?  We've got four so far.  Um, so far, yeah.  There's a few more on the way, though. 
[01:24:00]  All right.  Definitely a few more on the way.  What a great day for our country, as I said yesterday.  Showing support for our country.  I was here, like...  Yeah, I remember you.  ...for TrueGirls.com back in, like, March.  Yes.  With Michelle.  What'd you do for us?  For the website.  The Boyer House website.  Right.  Michelle.  Mm-hmm.  Did she get arrested?  No.  She's cold?  She's still free as ever.  She was a wild one.  She's a wild crazy...  I was convinced they were going to lock her up.  Crazy as ever.  Cool.  Hey, can we get Kimmy from Survivor back here? 
[01:24:30]  Yeah, we could get Kimmy back.  We haven't heard from Kimmy in a while.  Yeah.  Why do you like her?  It's not like she's got anything else to do.  Yeah, I was here with her.  Remember?  Yeah, I remember that.  We got crazy together.  You got crazy together.  Right.  Crazy.  Wild.  Softball game.  That was fun.  You're the softball girl.  Okay.  All right.  I'm remembering everything now.  We're always coming back.  You're right.  And we remember...  We got for Jay Warren's wife.  And we remember Mary, too.  Yeah, whatever.  Anyway.  Sex for Sam, too.  She was in Sex for Sam, too.  Mary.  Right.  I remember. 
[01:25:00]  All right, girls.  So why don't you go outside and, you know, take care of business and we'll talk to you  after you're done.  Yeah.  What happened?  Should I get waxed?  I don't know what they got.  We'll see what kind of equipment they have out there.  There they go.  I can pour beer on it.  I want to auction it on eBay.  What?  The leftovers?  Scraps?  The scraps?  The scraps?  Yeah.  Okay.  That sounds good.  Can somebody go to Dwayne Reed?  Go get a wax kit?  Yeah.  Let's go to Dwayne Reed for the girl.  Yeah.  Why not?  You'll be hooked up.  There you go.  All right.  I won't be able to do any lap dances tonight.  All right.  All right.  Face dances. 
[01:25:30]  Face dances.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  Okay.  All right.  There she goes.  That was so funny.  Stay in school.  Ladies stay in school.  What?  What happened?  Jeez.  I like the old days when they had a pimp to smack him in the face when they got out of  the line or spoke up.  When they talked too much.  When they talked out of turn.  I like the old days.  They have a big black guy with a velvet hat with a feather in it.  And if she spoke out of turn, she'd get the back of his hand. 
[01:26:00]  Yeah.  All right, Ant.  We're going to take a break.  All right.  We'll get into some other things.  Quick, quickly.  A couple phone numbers in the New York area.  877-692-1027.  Anywhere else, 866-277-4WOW.  As we go to break, let's check out what's going on on the FU line.  Hey, thanks for calling.  And here's the Opie to Anthony, FU line.  I just want to send out a big FU to the bastards who stole my car out of my driveway on Sunday night.  It was a silver Audi.  I hope you bastards crashed, broke both your legs, and I hope that your cars, your mother's cars, your kids' cars, and your grandkids' cars get stolen every freaking day. 
[01:26:30]  FU.  Next message.  I'd like to send a big FU to my 11th grade British literature teacher for making my life a living hell with their FU video project.  So FU.  Next message.  Yeah, this is Sean from Philly.  I just want to say FU, a**hole, the son of a b**ch, who freaking took my goddamn flag off my car, and at the same time, it's a crap out there to think stealing flags are cool. 
[01:27:00]  End of message.  Something strange is happening here.  FU.  There's something wrong with us.  How do we play what's in my pants?  Something very, very wrong with us.  What's a little contributing to the delinquency of a minor?  The Opie and Anthony Show.  I guess that's in teen pants.  Rock.  Yes, Rock.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:27:30]  How did I get two of these bad net hats?  The mesh hats?  The mesh hats that the guy brought.  Shave your bush for bush hats.  The T-shirts came out great, but the hats are lacking.  Like you said, the guys at the VA like the mesh hats.  My dad wears the mesh hat.  I got two of them now.  Here's our friend that made them.  Shalom.  What? 
[01:28:00]  I don't know what that means.  A little greeting.  Como estas?  Greg, you're next on the Opie and Anthony Show.  What's up?  Hey, you guys are wondering what a face dance was.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, I've experienced one up in the Canadian ballet before.  You lay down on stage in the one few minutes until the dollar comes out.  Hmm, they probably dumped out of that, huh?  Yeah, yeah.  You see, you were trying to be tricky, but the word you used still means the same thing.  You know what I mean? 
[01:28:30]  Right.  So you might as well just said her C.  Oh, her C.  I'm sorry.  You know, though, our listeners are smarter than you think.  Yeah.  When you say face dance, I think they get the picture.  The thing that you have added to this is that you lay on the stage.  That is true.  You lay on the stage.  And it's actually just close proximity.  There's no contact.  No, there's no contact.  And there are dollar bills involved.  Let's just put it that way.  Yes, there are.  All right, Greg.  Thank you for that.  Hey, thank you, guys.  Good show. 
[01:29:00]  We try.  Thanks.  Later.  Bye.  Do you put the buck in your mouth?  Could.  Could, sure.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  She grabs it from you.  Yes.  Okay.  Enough said.  There's a conversation going on outside the studio.  Oh, all the mics are in.  With our fine ladies.  Getting ready.  Oh, let's listen in.  Maybe we'll get the cure for cancer.  From them talking.  I think they're discussing how to get Osama bin Laden.  Is that it?  Yeah.  I thought maybe they were discussing mutual funds. 
[01:29:30]  Listen to this.  What?  What did they say?  No, this is really important.  I can't hear.  Can I hear?  What does she want to hear?  Oh, my God.  Can I hear?  Can I hear?  What?  Oh.  All right.  But it's just that the one wants to make sure she knows what we're saying?  Yeah.  Oh, there's the razor.  Well, yeah, the razor is warmed up and ready to go.  We're hoping other ladies show up today, Anthony.  A lot of ladies promised that they would come down today. 
[01:30:00]  So far, we have five or six.  Yeah.  So.  Hmm.  What are they saying?  Go.  They're just babbling.  Oh, there we go.  Wow.  What kind of, what are they using?  Sheep shears?  Shave bush for bush, Anthony.  Yeah, there it is.  The ladies showing their patriotism for America today.  That's good.  Any ladies want to come down and do this?  Feel free.  Ah, you know, just the sound of it's making me feel more American. 
[01:30:30]  Hey, Rick.  Yo.  How's it going out there?  It's going very well.  We've got our first girl on the table.  Mary.  She just got, she just got buzzed and now Rosanna's put.  I heard stinky.  Now she's getting lathered.  Okay.  Be careful how you.  With a close shave.  How are you going to talk about this?  Oh, wow.  They're going to use a blade?  Yeah.  Oh.  Hey, so Mary's on the table, huh?  Mary's on the table, yeah. 
[01:31:00]  Rick, let me know when someone hot is on the table so we can take a peek.  Oh, my God.  I will do that.  What does it look like?  Is it nice?  Like a tight little neck clam or?  Wow, you couldn't be further from the truth.  Oh, okay.  So it's like when you're walking down the beach and you see one of those big giant muscles  that washed up and.  Either that or a dead jellyfish.  I think I can describe it a little better, Anthony.  It's kind of like when, um, uh, grandpa pops out his teeth. 
[01:31:30]  Oh.  After Thanksgiving dinner.  Oh.  Oh.  You want something, um, that looks like it would be really hard to shuck.  You know what I mean?  Something a tight little neck clam.  I'm a good, but I'm a good shucker, Anthony.  You're a good shucker?  Sure.  I like, I like the shucking.  Listen to the, oh, my God.  All right.  The first girl is done.  Mary is done.  Mary's done.  Well, should we invite her in to take a look?  Come to New York Center for Events.  Yeah.  Why don't we invite Mary into the studio, Rick? 
[01:32:00]  Mary, cover your chest.  Why does she have to cover her chest?  Well, because she's got to get up and she's falling around.  Now you can go.  Go ahead.  Hey, what were they saying was ugly, by the way?  Um, she said the way it looked when it was done.  Oh, let's see.  Oh, my God.  Well, I just saw a flash, so they're taking pictures or shooting her.  One or the other.  We're taking pictures, and some of them will make it up on the website.  Here she comes, guys.  All right.  She's coming in.  All right.  Let me see.  Come here.  It's just all wrong.  Let's take a look.  What's the problem? 
[01:32:30]  Lift up.  Lift, lift your, well, you've got to back up.  I can't see from that close.  All right.  Right there.  Now, let me see.  All right.  What's wrong with that?  What's wrong?  Don't she miss a spot?  She did miss a spot.  There's like a, look at the line, Oak.  You're not as patriotic as we thought.  There's still, um, go around.  I got to go.  Go around to Opi's side, and look at the spot that they missed.  It looks like Duff Führer.  What are they, blind?  It's a little Billy Dee Williams.  No, maybe that's what, maybe that's, uh. 
[01:33:00]  Wow, that is weird.  Ah, Rick.  Yo.  This one's coming out for a touch-up.  Ah.  She's coming back out for a touch-up.  They forgot a spot.  They forgot a big spot.  There's a reason we tried to make it quick.  All right.  Uh, Mary's going back on the, oh my God.  You guys didn't notice you missed a spot?  Oh no, like I said, we tried to make it quick.  Let me talk to the ladies over there.  They're not doing their job.  Ah, Rosanna.  What?  You left a spot on Mary.  I told her I would not go below a certain area. 
[01:33:30]  Therefore, if there's a spot that's left there, it's left there for a reason.  What do you mean?  You won't go?  Hey, hey, hey.  Hold on.  Oh, oh, oh.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  No one has any clue what we're doing today, so let's keep it that way.  Don't, uh.  Yeah, don't use any descriptive language.  I, I understand, uh.  Let's just put it this way.  There's got to be something you could do for Mary. 
[01:34:00]  Okay?  Yeah.  It just looks wrong.  Fix that.  Just fix that.  We'll have her touch it up.  She was just complaining she doesn't have the precision equipment necessary to do certain types of.  I saw what that was that needed no precision equipment.  They just missed a spot.  All right.  I'm not asking for anything else.  Are we moving on to the second lady?  Yes, our second lady is on.  Hey, ladies, by the way, it's not too late to come down here and get this done.  Oh, no.  We got t-shirts and everything, man.  Come on down.  You get to hang out. 
[01:34:30]  If you're over 21, you get to have a beer.  Right.  And the t-shirts look great.  They really do.  All right.  Morgan's on the table now, laying down.  All right.  Morgan's on the table.  She's just here for a touch-up.  A touch-up?  Yeah.  A little off the top, as you would say to the barber, right?  That's not what we do.  Hey.  Oh, my God.  Rick.  Rick.  Could you take the mic and smack her in the head with it?  I wish I could.  Put an oil rag in her mouth.  Okay.  What don't they understand about not describing anything about certain areas? 
[01:35:00]  Not much, dude.  Well, could you maybe inform them that no one is to say anything?  Tell Barbra Streisand to shut her yap.  Oh.  That's good.  Wow.  Am I right?  Yeah.  Am I right?  Dead on.  Okay.  Thank you.  All right.  How's Morgan coming?  That's good, chumpy. 
[01:35:30]  They're shaving for America.  All right.  So where are we at, Rick?  What's wrong?  We're just, she's just cleaning up Morgan.  She's just finishing up the last few razors.  Ah, good.  Morgan's very easy.  She's got nothing in the area, so we're basically just shaping her up, and that's it.  All right.  Wow.  All right.  We can actually broadcast that.  That was nice.  Jesus.  She is done.  We're going to send her in to have you guys take a look.  All right.  Okay.  Here comes Morgan, Anthony. 
[01:36:00]  It's your boyfriend.  It's my boyfriend.  Oh, great.  Here she comes.  What the F are you doing on the Opie and Anthony show today?  You said you were shopping at the mall with the girls.  Get her in there.  It's your boyfriend.  I wonder what he wants.  All right.  Now, stay there, because I've got to see the distance shot.  Wow, Morgan.  All right.  There it is.  Yeah, get rid of the shaving cream.  You might remember Morgan's second place in the whipped cream bikini contest.  Yes.  Yeah, give me your website. 
[01:36:30]  Of course, I'll give you a plug there.  Go around and show Opie now so he can get a good look at the patriotism.  She's got the nice t-shirt on.  Whoa, what's that?  It's shaving cream.  Oh, wow.  Look at that.  Very nice.  Very nice.  Are you all right?  Yeah.  That's good.  All right, cool.  That's Morgan.  All right.  Go out and support your fellow shavies.  And you can go to her website, bikiniqueen.com, right?  Right, Morgan? 
[01:37:00]  Yeah, that's it.  And don't forget to come in today.  All right.  Stilettos, Emanuette.  Oh, yeah, you're going to be dancing Stilettos.  Mary, hold that door open.  Emanuette.  Yeah, no, I'm jumping on stage with her.  Oh, yeah, you're going to recite poetry.  Thank you.  There she goes.  All right.  There you go.  That's the second girl, Anthony.  Last time I saw something like that, Opie, I think I could describe what happened.  I was eating the filet mignon, right?  And I sneezed at the same time. 
[01:37:30]  And I held my nose as I sneezed.  I didn't even want to know what was going on there.  I don't even want to know.  Sean, what's going on?  I've seen more attractive stuff hanging out of the side of a roll full of steakums.  It's kind of like when you do a sloppy job with your bathroom and you put a little too  much caulk around the bathtub. 
[01:38:00]  Yeah.  Wow.  Sean.  What's going on?  Hey.  God bless America.  Yes.  We're doing our part for America.  Hey.  Yeah.  I want everyone to go down.  You guys mentioned Rocco.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Rockhole.  Whatever.  Yeah.  Yay.  He's going to be down at Revere Beach tonight.  You guys want someone to tape it?  Revere Beach.  He's doing a little gig tonight.  Oh, that's right.  At the H2O Club.  Yes.  What's the place?  The H2O Club.  It's a rotten place right next door to Kelly's. 
[01:38:30]  All right.  Well, the O&A Army could, you know.  Definitely show up because we're going to have our camera crew there.  Show up with camera and or a dat tape, something that we can get audio from.  And just show your love for Rocco.  We're going to have a camera down there.  As he is down there live tonight.  And it's open to the public.  So anybody that wants to go down there and have a good time.  And show their love.  Show their love for Rocco.  We definitely want to videotape of it, though. 
[01:39:00]  We're actually going to be down there shooting it for you guys.  I'll call Sean.  Mint.  Thank you.  All right.  The Army should, you know, show up and get together in the parking lot.  Make a dance out of the sale.  And you know something?  I think if you do videotape this thing, I think maybe we'll give a prize for the best showing of love.  There you go.  All right.  All right.  Thank you, bro.  See you, Matt.  Bye.  Peace.  You know, you're fixed?  Wow.  Mary's back. 
[01:39:30]  Great.  All right.  Mary's back with the fix.  Let's see.  All right.  Yeah, let's see the fix.  Go ahead.  Let's see the fix first.  Stand there.  Don't get too close because I can't see.  I got to look at it.  Very good.  Now you're clean as a whistle.  Do you feel better, Mary, now that it's cleaned up there?  Much, much.  All right.  Good.  That's good.  Now, how about...  I'll take Anne's word for it, by the way.  You're done?  I'm good.  I'm done.  Let me see.  Come over here.  Wait.  What's her name?  Rina.  Hi, Rina.  Rina, let's see.  Come over here.  Now stand there.  Wow, look at that. 
[01:40:00]  You know what you look like standing there?  You look like that little Vietnamese chick running down the street after the village was napalmed.  Ew.  Ew.  You ever see that one?  Well, you're a skinny little girl.  Stop.  You're a skinny girl.  Remember that one?  That little girl.  She's going to cry like that girl in a minute.  She's running down the street.  I'm not going to cry.  You know what?  I'm going to auction my little hairs off at Stilettos tonight.  All right.  Anybody who wants to buy them, be my guest.  That's good.  Are you guys going to be wearing the t-shirts on stage tonight, please?  Oh, you should.  You should come out with the t-shirts. 
[01:40:30]  Absolutely.  So people go, oh my God, this is one of the girls that was on Opie and Anthony today.  Stilettos and Manuel.  Like a stump.  Very good.  I'll be there tonight with Janine, Triple X, Mega Porn Star.  All right.  Glenn, we love you.  Can I take a look there?  Yeah, show Opie.  Go around.  No, you got to go around the console.  Here, go around.  Hello.  Go around that way and show.  I thought maybe I was.  I know the language was coming out of me for a second.  Oh, you're so safe.  Oh, great.  Oh, nice.  Let me see.  You see? 
[01:41:00]  You got to back up.  You can't see from there.  Very nice.  Wow.  Yeah.  I had this urge to charge something.  Money, money.  What?  Okay.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Very good.  Ladies, if you would now make your way out, Mary, open up the door, show the ladies the  way out.  Thank you very much.  Rick, what else is going on out there?  Number four, Barbara is now getting herself shaved and then she'll be lathered up for the  close-up.  Opie?  Yeah. 
[01:41:30]  What was that girl's name?  You know what?  I imagine that being like women, picture Earth women on a planet with a gravitational pull  of Jupiter, you know, and what that gravity might do to certain areas of the body.  Wow.  Wow.  I thought she was lovely.  Did you notice there was like...  I thought it was lovely.  It was a little...  Picture a big glob of Turkish taffy on a July afternoon.  Did you see how skinny she was? 
[01:42:00]  She looked like that little Vietnamese girl.  Just running away from her eighth village.  Let's go to Charlie.  Charlie, what's up?  Yeah.  Hey, man.  This is pretty cool.  They sound stupid enough.  How do they look?  They're all hot.  What do they do?  They're strippers or what?  What's going on?  Most of them are hot.  Most of them are hot.  Go to our website later tonight and you'll see for yourself what they look like.  Well, describe maybe some breast action.  How big are they?  How do they look?  They all have nice size implants. 
[01:42:30]  Oh, very cool.  And how's things looking down there?  One girl has natural boobs.  Yeah.  How's things looking in the area?  You got any bacon strips or anything down there?  What's going on?  Dude, have you been listening?  No.  Well, I heard some about the steak them.  Right.  But that was...  Is it bad?  They all come in different shapes and sizes.  Right.  I think we're giving an adequate description and staying within the guy.  So that's going to be like you're going to have close-up photos of the bacon batch tonight?  I don't know if they'll let...  Well, we'll see.  We're taking lots of pictures and we'll see what we can get away with. 
[01:43:00]  Right on.  Thanks, man.  You got fans in Portland, Oregon, man.  Wow.  You're on the first call from Portland, Oregon.  Yeah, yeah, sure.  A friend of mine turned me on to you guys last night and I'm checking it out.  It's pretty cool, man.  You got to talk it up a little more, man.  I need to basically be seeing these girls, you know?  Spread the word, man.  We're in Sasquatch country.  Have fun.  All right.  Later.  They must hate that.  Portland, hey, Bigfoot country, right?  Get it?  You ever see a Bigfoot?  Shut up.  All right, guys. 
[01:43:30]  Barbara's done.  All right.  We're going to send her in right now for her to take...  For you guys to inspect.  Okay.  Here comes Barbara doing her part for America.  Barbara's won't shy.  Are you pierced?  Well, she's got some jewelry.  Let me see.  Yeah, you got like little jewelry going on there, but very nice.  Very clean.  There's uniformity in skin pigmentation, Opie.  Very nice.  Very nice.  Very good. 
[01:44:00]  Go show Opie around the other side.  Are you, what, you mortified?  I've never had it.  Oh, you've never done this before.  Oh, don't you worry about it.  It's for a good coffee.  What do you think, Opie?  Oh, yeah, sure.  Right?  Oh, yeah.  Very nice.  There you go.  Very nice.  It's for America.  It is truly for America.  It's so nice.  I have such a good feeling about what we're doing.  Finally, we can help. 
[01:44:30]  Doug, what's going on?  What's up, guys?  Did you see any blue claw mouths today?  Did you ever see a crab when you used to catch them out of the water, the bubbles they used  to blow out of their mouths?  Yeah.  No, nothing.  Nothing like that today?  Nothing like the blue claw.  No.  Take it easy, guys.  Oh, I think the ladies are lovely.  Fargo from North Brunswick saying, sounds like a damn chicken coop in the background.  Cluck, cluck, cluck.  Well, they're disgusting.  Very important stuff, Anthony.  Hey, Rick.  I know, Matt, the term is meat cooking. 
[01:45:00]  Yeah, what's up, guys?  Try to get a mic on these ladies.  All right.  Make believe we're off the air.  No problem.  You know, or just, you know.  All right.  Put the mic near there.  Here, the brain surgery that's going on.  Okay, just take your clothes off.  Used to hearing that.  Yeah.  Well, they're not talking now.  What do you mind saying?  Walls or like a strip or what?  Jungle.  All right.  Jungle? 
[01:45:30]  All right.  Yeah, I think so.  All right, Rick.  Thank you for that.  Thank you.  Nothing going on.  Thank you.  We're talking about clams or something.  Thank you for that.  Stumps.  Hey, we have some George Carlin tickets to give away for tonight or tomorrow.  Where's Carlin tonight?  Oh, yeah.  Beacon.  Beacon.  They're filming for HBO.  How are we going to give these away?  All right.  We'll figure that out.  Maybe we'll just go on the street and give out some Carlin tickets really fast.  Girl.  Should we take a break and then we'll continue with our Bush for Bush, Anthony? 
[01:46:00]  Yeah, we could do that.  Where are all the other ladies that promised they would come down here today?  We had quite a few.  What happened to the Canadian model?  Yeah.  Oh, that's right.  That's the body double and gets naked in all those movies.  Damn it.  Huh?  Where'd she go?  I don't know.  Well, call up.  Okay.  We're going to take a break.  Oh, let's put Opie's taint talent to the test.  Can you do it after it's freshly shaved?  I wonder.  I might throw things off, but I'm willing to give it a shot. 
[01:46:30]  All right.  Maybe we can find a girl that wants to participate.  I'm certainly feeling it today, Anthony.  I bet you are.  I'm feeling it.  The taint talent is, you know, it's kind of strange when it pops out there, the talent of mine.  You know what it is, though?  Some days I just don't feel it.  You know what, though?  You've got to feel a little pressure because you are at 100%.  Right.  You have not missed guessing a girl's age merely by her taint.  I believe I'm four for four. 
[01:47:00]  Yeah.  So the pressure now, because once you blow it, it's like, oh, now he hasn't done it every time.  Right.  It shows a little, a chink in the armor, they call it.  I'm pretty confident today.  You're that confident?  Yes, I am.  All right.  Maybe we'll have to do that.  Keith's like, there better not be any cleanuses.  Don't worry, Keith.  We're fine today.  We haven't seen any cleaners.  Okay.  Quick break and we'll be back.  Stay there.  I am Dave.  I'm Perry.  Steven.  And we're Jane's Addiction.  This is Jane's Addiction.  You're listening to Opie.  And Anthony. 
[01:47:30]  You're listening to Opie.  And Anthony.  Anthony and Opie.  And you're listening.  1027 WNEW.  We are Sports Guys, Blaine and Craig.  Morning, John and Mike.  Midday.  Opie and Anthony Afternoon.  Ron and Fez at night.  We are 1027 WNEW.  Man, I feel like buying some Nikes, Anthony.  Yeah.  Friday.  Friday.  Friday.  Friday.  Friday. 
[01:48:00]  And that's SDP.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  I think it's going quite well today, Ant.  Yes.  What a day for America.  Shave Bush for Bush.  All right.  We've done about five or six ladies thus far.  Yeah.  We're hoping for more, but this is okay.  Yeah.  Well, maybe before the end of the show, we'll have a couple more girls come down.  I believe we can keep this going next week.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  All week.  Why not?  I mean, hell, we got 40 t-shirts. 
[01:48:30]  We got to get 40 girls.  Yeah, eventually.  Can't wear one of the shirts unless you had it done.  No.  Doesn't really make sense unless we do that.  We got to earn it.  A lot of excitement outside the studio, Anthony.  I guess another girl has arrived.  Oh, thank God.  We're going to bring her in the studio for a little pre-interview.  Wait, what?  Did I just hear that, too?  No, no, no.  I knew it. 
[01:49:00]  Come on.  I knew it.  You got to see her hair, too, man.  Yay!  It's Patty.  Oh, Patty, you want to get yourself shaved?  Patty, is that the same ridiculous wig we bought you?  Yeah, I just gave it a haircut.  When I went to a store to look at your wigs, they're $50, $60.  I don't even have that extra to spend in a week, you know.  Yeah, so you...  And in three weeks or four weeks, I'm going to throw this away anyway. 
[01:49:30]  I won't need it.  So you gave it a haircut?  Yeah, I wanted bangs.  You gave it a wig and a haircut?  I felt like bangs, so I just went sniffing.  Oh, I see how you did that.  Yeah, because it was looking...  You know something?  It does look a little better.  Yeah, I look better with bangs.  Oh, my God.  Because I got worry lines on my forehead.  Worry lines everywhere.  Can you take it off so we can see how much of your hair is growing in?  Sure.  Oh, my God.  It just really hasn't grown in, has it? 
[01:50:00]  Patty, it's not growing in as fast as you thought, is it?  Wait, take the wig off again.  She really looks like a concentration camp victim now.  Take the wig off.  No, I look like an emu.  Look at her.  Oh, my God.  It's more than there was of three...  It's only been three weeks.  You know, we're getting new listeners every day, Anthony.  Yeah.  And losing listeners every day.  In Washington.  According to Washington, D.C.  Patty, a regular on the show, we shaved her head down to the skin for U2 tickets, 
[01:50:30]  and it's been growing back for about three weeks now.  And you have, like, you probably couldn't even grab some of that hair to pull.  It is that short still.  Well, yeah, but...  I was thinking, you know, just the other day, I'm thinking to myself,  I wonder how much of Patty's hair has grown in.  And I imagine it would be more than that.  It really...  You look like a man with AIDS.  Thank you.  Let me put the wig back on. 
[01:51:00]  I love the peanut butter teeth myself.  Oh!  Fight Club chick.  Yeah, you do look like the Fight Club chick.  Patty, you've got to start wearing bras, though, man.  It's one of Sigourney Weaver's bad clones from that Alien movie.  There you go.  Put the part in the middle.  Put the part in the middle.  She made a part on the wig, and she trimmed it up a little bit.  I needed bangs.  Yeah, but somebody said that if it grows back at the same rate in about another month, I'll be fine. 
[01:51:30]  It'll look just like a very short haircut.  Another month?  No, Patty.  They've been lying to you.  No, I don't see it.  No way.  Well, I've even started taking extra supplements and taking...  What kind of supplements?  You're taking hair supplements?  Yeah.  Hoping it'll grow back?  It's probably working in our armpits.  Well, I want it to grow back faster.  So you're taking supplements?  Yeah.  It's like a sulfide type of a thing, you know, like a supplement from the health food store. 
[01:52:00]  How much is that running you?  Six dollars, because I have a club card.  They don't even recognize me back at the colony.  I want to shave off my cilia from my 30.  Well, look, in a few...  I'm sure by January, it'll look like something.  Somebody said it'll be even healthier because it's new hair. 
[01:52:30]  Oh, right.  It'll be healthier.  Yeah.  Well, there.  Your conditioning?  Well, I'm using baby shampoo right now because I'm afraid of the rougher chemicals and stuff.  So I'm just using as gentle as I can get.  No more tears.  She cries enough when she thinks of her life.  She doesn't need it with shampoo in her eyes.  Johnson & Johnson's baby shampoo.  No more tears until I think about my position in life and I cry like a baby.  Patty, what are you doing here? 
[01:53:00]  Well, I came to get saved for my patriotic dick.  Now, Patty, are you basically a hairy woman?  You know, I'm not even that American, Anthony.  Are you?  Not really that hairy.  You think we ought to toss this one to the Taliban?  What the hell?  I think we could use a few more mosques in America.  Oh, my God.  I don't want to see that.  Are you basically, do you touch that up? 
[01:53:30]  Have we ever seen that area on her?  Yeah.  I had the whipped cream bikini.  Yeah, the whipped cream bikini, but...  But that was back in the summer.  Right.  And now, is it natural, would you say?  Well, sort of.  Why don't we take a gander?  You want to take a pre-look?  Let's take a gander.  All right, Patty.  Let's see.  Let's see the before.  Let's root on Patty, everyone.  You're not shy anymore, Patty.  You're so past that. 
[01:54:00]  Let's hear it from the peanut gallery over there.  Yeah.  Patty, you got to stand back a little because we can't see from there.  Just stand there.  Yeah.  Just when you guys thought we had the greatest job in America.  All right, Patty.  This is the other side of it, my friends.  There you go.  What are you wearing?  What the hell are you wearing?  It's just my bodysuit.  She's got a bodysuit on.  All right, here she goes.  She's got the old granny panties on. 
[01:54:30]  Down to the knees, Patty.  I didn't see.  We all saw it, Anthony.  I didn't see anything.  Wow.  Patty, Patty, you listening?  Patty, you got to go down to the knees.  I can't see.  Wait, get the ladies in here.  Get the hot pieces of asses in here to kind of balance out.  I can't see anything about this situation.  The scales of justice, Anthony.  All right, great. 
[01:55:00]  Thank you, Morgan.  All right, let's turn around and look at Patty.  And what do you think?  I'm not the type.  Well, go ahead.  Down to the knees, Patty.  I'm not the type for what?  It's got to go.  All right.  There you go.  Look at uncharted territory.  That's uncharted territory.  Sorry, never fouled by a man.  Didn't Geraldo do a special on her?  Wasn't she one of the girls at Willowbrook rocking in her feces? 
[01:55:30]  All right, sorry.  Can we thank the ladies for shaving us?  Yeah.  Don't worry.  We'll take care of all that.  We love you.  Yeah, everyone's in love now.  All right.  Well, Patty, Patty, it didn't look like there's much there to deal with.  No.  Is that naturally like that?  It's natural.  No, it's not.  I didn't see much like that.  Yeah, you're trying to do something special there.  I practice very good hygiene. 
[01:56:00]  Hi, Jean.  Hi, Jean.  How are you?  I practice hygiene.  Hi, Jean.  Hello, Jean.  Can we put one of the mesh hats on her?  Yeah, put a mesh hat on your...  Put one of the mesh hats on Patty.  Put the hat.  Here's the mesh hat.  Put on the bush for...  Shave your bush for bush.  The hat that the guys at the VA like to wear.  There it is.  That's great.  Oh, the hair and the hat look attached.  All she's missing is that Special Olympics bronze medal. 
[01:56:30]  Hey, Garth.  Yeah, yeah.  It's like Wayne's World.  It's Wayne's World.  Yeah.  Hey, Garth.  That is...  Patty, turn your head sideways.  I want to see if I can see straight through the mesh.  No, keep the hat on.  Oh, straight through the mesh?  Yeah, go ahead.  Yeah.  Yeah, look.  You see that little air pocket?  Oh, my God.  That's good, Patty.  All right.  Well, hey, Rick, go ahead.  Go...  Go ahead.  Take care of Patty out there.  And then we can see the after shot when she's done. 
[01:57:00]  Patty, if you would...  Patty, if you would...  Patty, if you...  And the rest of you ladies, join Patty in her patriotic bid to be patriotic.  Ah, there we go.  And why are the guys staying in the studio?  Guys, don't you want to check this out?  Yeah.  There they go.  What's up?  You want to say one thing?  All right.  You want to say one thing?  Yes, Mary.  I'm sorry, PR.  I'm going to be really late.  So, just hang out.  That's what we are.  We're a paging service here.  We're a 50,000-watt 15-city...  No, I'm trying to get him a date. 
[01:57:30]  I'm trying to hook him up tonight.  I didn't say dating.  I said it's a pager service.  We're a 50,000-watt 15-city pager.  No, I'm just trying to...  Hi, Tom.  Tom, could you call?  No, stop.  PR, tell us how it is, all right?  Patty, so, you know...  There you go.  Step back.  What was I doing?  All right.  What was I doing?  Turnip butt?  What'd she say I was doing?  Oh, Jesus.  What'd she say, Stinky?  That you were drooling over Patty.  Oh, yeah, that's the old tag.  That's always funny.  Turnip butt. 
[01:58:00]  Turnip ass.  Picture a turnip, right?  Now, put it in tight denim.  I've had a rough week, man.  I ain't put up with that crap.  You know something?  I am so sick of strippers.  I'm sorry.  I am sick.  Not of looking.  It's great when you go to the club and they're in their own environment.  It's like when you see a Bengal tiger, Opie.  Where do you want to see it?  In the jungle.  No, in the jungle. 
[01:58:30]  I want to see it in the jungle.  I don't want to see it out of its natural element.  You feel sorry for it and you realize how sad it is to look at.  That's exactly how I feel.  I like them in their natural setting, sliding down a goddamn pole.  With the lights and the music.  When they're here and they're talking, it's like, do they have to do that talking thing?  So you need the lights, the music, the narcotics.  Right.  Everything that has to do with strip clubs because when they open those mouths, the makeup and that attitude they got, 
[01:59:00]  like all the guys are drooling or waiting to see what they have to say.  No one cares what you have to say.  I'm sorry.  That's why you're stripping.  Let's go to the outside mic, Ant.  All right.  Hey, Rick.  Rick.  Rick, he probably can't hear you.  He's engrossed in a conversation.  Rick.  What?  What's up?  I had to tell Patty to take her pants off.  No, go out there. 
[01:59:30]  Let's get it done.  Yeah, go out there.  Let's get on the mic.  And we'll take you live to the new Ground Zero.  Another horrific sight here in Manhattan.  Oh, my God.  Did you see what time has not been kind to that?  What was that?  She's 45 years old, right?  Yeah.  She's a virgin.  Come on, Patty.  Take a pant.  Yet it looks like it had been punched by Mike Tyson.  That's not true.  Didn't it?  Not really.  It was black and blue.  Oh.  No?  It's like a flat tire. 
[02:00:00]  A flat tire.  Were you digging it?  Take a pant.  Look at me being all defensive over a naked guy.  Over Patty.  West Coast Dave Anthony.  Steve's back hair.  Now Patty's meat, uh, meat.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Okay.  Where's my Vicodin?  No.  Is that a...  What is it?  Let Opie call one of them Joey Ramone.  The place will clear out.  Wow, Anthony.  That's a good one.  Really?  I think most of my comments going right over their heads. 
[02:00:30]  Please.  Anything would.  Rick.  Oh, my God.  Hey, you guys should come out here and look at this.  Oh.  Do you have to?  With her grandma freaking leggings on, she looks hot.  Oh.  Oh.  And her big knuckly toes.  Oh, look at the claw she's got on her big toe.  What, her nails are like really gnarly?  Dude, it's huge.  I have good hygiene.  Oh, my God. 
[02:01:00]  No way.  Dude, come out here and see this.  We'll check it out after you guys have done it.  Yeah, yeah.  We'll have her come in.  No, really.  Come out here and see this.  I hear the girls ewing out there.  Ewing.  Ewing.  Oh.  Ewing.  People want to see it, Pat.  Brain surgeons.  I got pigeon toes.  I got pigeon toes?  No, pigeon toes doesn't mean you got claws.  Yeah, pigeon body.  Like a, you know what?  Brr.  She is a mess, man. 
[02:01:30]  I bet it just reeks out there, too.  Someone.  I bet it just stinks out there.  I went into the no crunch zone, the bathroom.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Hold on a second.  Someone either crunched or dropped the kid in there.  Oh, God.  They all just stink.  Rick, what's going on?  Oh.  They think that perfume covers it up and stuff.  It doesn't.  It looks like a member of the Taliban got stuck over here.  This is, oh, my goodness. 
[02:02:00]  Why is everyone laughing?  What's going on out there?  Oh.  What's going on, t-shirt guy?  T-shirt guy, you digging it?  You digging the...  It's the ugliest thing he's ever seen.  Oh, listen to this.  It's like a fire.  The razor is recoiling, trying to pull away, even though it's a machine.  She's showing it out there today.  She has a member of the Taliban in a leg lock.  Oh, is that what it is?  Oh, yeah.  And we need some air fresheners. 
[02:02:30]  Stat.  Is it, like, thick?  It's very...  Dude, it's just wrangled all over the place.  You've got to see all the faces I'm looking at, man.  It's like they're...  What the hell is that?  What was that?  A lot of foam to cover the area.  Oh, oh, oh.  Oh, my God.  This is probably...  Something like a rabid dog.  This is probably the most she's ever gotten.  This is the most she's ever gotten?  Yeah, does it look like...  Dude. 
[02:03:00]  Why are all the guys coming back?  It looks...  That's a buzz kill, man.  I think...  I think I found the source of a...  I think the best description, probably, when they put on that whipped cream, is something  akin to St. Bernard with rabies.  And no teeth.  It looks like a 20-year-old poodle about to die.  A toothless St. Bernard.  All right, why don't we talk to the ladies that are doing the shaving?  Wow, right?  Why don't we go, oh, this isn't bad at all. 
[02:03:30]  Listen.  This is Dale.  Dale, what do you think?  It's not that bad.  It's actually not that bad.  Right, Daddy?  Yeah, of course.  Dale, you're a liar.  I'm not a liar.  It's the company line.  You're a liar.  They don't want anybody feeling...  All right, it's really bad.  ...embarrassed.  What's the problem, Dale?  You know, it looks like Patty just hasn't done anything for a little bit of a long time.  That's exactly what it is.  No maintenance. 
[02:04:00]  I have good hygiene.  With a little maintenance, she'll be just fine.  You know how the grass grows around the sump tank?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm hearing the video.  Isn't someone out there shooting video of this?  Unfortunately, yeah.  It looks exactly...  With her laying there like that, it looks exactly like Fox's alien autopsy video.  I'm hearing there's no difference at all.  Holy...  You cannot tell the difference.  You just nailed the visual, my brother.  No, Anthony from West Orange. 
[02:04:30]  Steve, what's wrong?  Steve from FoundryMusic.com.  I've seen a ghost.  Isn't that awful?  Oh, she's disgusting.  It's hot, right?  Yeah, sure.  Elliot, I gotta make a phone.  I gotta phone home.  Turn on your hot light.  Let it shine wherever you go.  Rick, is she almost done?  Let me see.  They're wiping away some of the covering.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  The shaving cream.  Yeah, the shaving cream.  I believe it is. 
[02:05:00]  I just saw something like gravity had been pulling for a while on that.  That's what I saw.  And I was a good 20 feet away from her.  Like I said, it looks like she's been riding on the rim for a while.  Hey, man, we can't end this today with Patty.  I hope some more ladies are showing up.  No, please.  And also...  Kind of to clean the palate, Anthony.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, after you take that shot of tequila, you need to kind of throw back some beer to  kind of clean it out there.  We need some sorbet between the courses. 
[02:05:30]  Yes, we do.  To cleanse the palate.  I haven't seen it yet.  Is she done?  Everyone's horrified out there.  Just about.  Earl, come on in here.  What's wrong?  The faces everyone is making is hilarious.  I can tell Dale, the one who's doing the show.  What's the matter, Earl?  Earl, you have to at least have seen a good one before you can say if it's bad.  What are you looking at?  Earl?  Earl, what do you think?  It looks like an alien autopsy.  Yeah. 
[02:06:00]  It does.  She's laying there, and her skin is gray, and she's got the same hips as the little alien.  All right.  I guess we're at our point with Patty.  We can't go any further.  Is she done?  All right.  Invite her back in so we can take a look.  It's not as effective.  Why isn't it as effective?  You'll see when it comes in. 
[02:06:30]  What the heck is going on?  I'm thinking they can only go so far.  Much of the damage was done to the lower floors.  Wait.  I've got to get Lou on the line.  I can't.  This line's too good.  He's got to do it.  Lou, what's up?  Hey.  Does she got the dangling turkey neck and talons?  Go on, or what?  Talons, yes.  Very good, Lou.  She sounds like a hot piece of action, huh?  Tell her not to put her shoe on.  I want to see that toenail.  It's her brain that everyone's interested in, right?  Yeah, of course.  Thanks, Lou.  Looks like she scrapes around for food outside with those. 
[02:07:00]  Come on.  Let's get her in here, man.  Yeah, get her in here.  Takes so long.  They're all cackling out there.  It's so weird.  The other ladies, it took five seconds.  Yeah.  They've been at Patty for about, I don't know.  Well, that's where most of the damage is.  It takes a little longer on the damaged goods.  It's kind of like the pit crew at a NASCAR event, isn't it?  Right.  If you're just changing a tire, it's easy.  If you blew a turbo or something, it's going to take you some time.  Ladies and gentlemen, here comes Stalker Patty.  Patty. 
[02:07:30]  With her wig on that she trimmed because she wanted bangs.  And she can never come in here when you ask for it.  Patty, come here.  She can never come in here.  Patty.  Patty, come over here.  Oh, my God.  She looks like...  Walk her over here, Rick.  She's got to go there.  She looks like she was just violated.  Patty, walk over here.  Stand there.  Oh, my God.  Let me see your gnarly toenail.  You have a hammer toe, huh?  Yeah.  Is that what that's called?  Yeah.  Put your foot up top.  I have to have an operation years ago. 
[02:08:00]  All right.  Well, another operation.  What is she sitting for?  Look at her toe.  I looked at her toe.  Put your toe up here.  Put your toe up there so I hope you can see it.  Oh, my God.  I have to have...  Oh, God.  What the hell is that?  Patty, why don't you clip?  I wear clothes, sandals, and sneakers.  Patty, clip your toenails.  It hurts when I do it.  Well, take the pain.  Take the pain.  Well, Patty, stand up and go over there.  You've got to go kind of over there.  Now, what is the problem down there?  What?  Now, spin around.  Now, let's see what they've done. 
[02:08:30]  We've got to see how you've done this.  Be proud.  Pick that shirt up a flap.  What is all that?  Pick that up.  All right.  Let me...  Patty, we've got to see.  Hold on.  Let me look.  All right.  I see.  They didn't want to go below a certain point, so it's kind of...  That's like if you turn an artichoke upside down.  Well, I've got a better analogy.  Or a corn cob.  You know when you dip the strawberries in the chocolate?  Yeah.  Right.  Patty, let me see.  Let me just see. 
[02:09:00]  Patty, let's see.  Patty, let me take a look.  Come on over here.  Patty, you're not...  I'm getting in trouble.  All right.  Go around to...  Oh, don't worry about it.  We weren't referring to your jobs.  I like chocolate strawberries.  What's the matter, Ben?  Here it is.  Opie, take a look at this.  Yeah.  Look.  Nice.  Holy S.  Patty, right?  An expert.  Wait.  Wait.  What?  What?  Come on. 
[02:09:30]  It's like a yam bag or something.  Up again.  Up again.  And you're trying to tell me you're a virgin.  I am.  That's virgin.  Boy, when you think virginal, you're not thinking that.  What happened, Patty?  You all right?  Yeah, I'm fine.  Maybe if you spend the next 45 years doing a headstand.  By the time you're 90, that'll look like a virginal.  What's up with the grandma stocking thing? 
[02:10:00]  What are you wearing?  I do a lot of walking.  I only wear these in the winter.  Patty, can't.  Oh, my God.  Look at those toes, man.  What is that called?  I've never seen that before.  Hammer toes.  I have a bad condition with them.  I don't have the money to do anything about it.  How can they fix those?  It's a simple operation.  You can start by clipping your toenails.  Patty.  But my feet.  She's circling. 
[02:10:30]  Patty, clip the toenails.  Joe, she just grabbed a rabbit.  My problem is I'm ultra sensitive on my feet and my toes, and they give me a lot of pain.  I need these talons.  I ride on the updrafts, and I pounce on a little bunny when I see him in the field.  Yeah, but I've had foot problems all my life.  I'm a hawk ant.  I'm not an animal.  I'm a human being.  I'm a human being.  Patty, wow.  Look at that.  That's hammer toe, right?  Yeah. 
[02:11:00]  How does it hurt when you cut your toenails, though?  Your toenails are dead.  Your toenails are huge.  Your toenails are like dead things.  Why are they like claws sticking out from your toes a good inch?  They're so big.  They're curling under a little bit.  What do you do?  It's just that my foot condition makes it painful.  Patty, we're going to get you.  Here's Patty running.  We're going to have to get you a free operation, because you can't walk around like that.  I've been like that since I was 17 years old.  17?  You've had toenails like that?  Well, feet like that. 
[02:11:30]  Man, we discover new things on your body every day.  Because we're seeing more of it than we ever wanted.  Why do you think I wear clothes sandals in the summertime and sneakers all the time?  Patty, let me see that ass.  Turn around.  Oh, I don't have a big one.  I just don't want you to turn around.  All right.  Let's see.  Because now you can see the whole package.  Pick up that thing in the middle.  That's my body suit.  Yeah.  Hot.  Nice.  Get her on the pinball machine.  In the words of Norm, we'll be back Monday. 
[02:12:00]  Awful.  Thank you, Patty.  Patty, great patriotism you're showing.  It's time to get back to the mothership and fly home.  Okay.  Time to get through.  The girls can't help you out with that, huh?  That's all they're going to do for you?  Well, I'm going to go back and I'll do epilite.  Oh, you're going to do the epilite for...  I've been doing, you know, my boobs for like a year now.  All right.  I'm going to do epilite.  Okay. 
[02:12:30]  Thank you, Patty.  Could they turn the epilite laser thing up to the power of the Death Star and just hit  you in the head with it?  I got a couple hairs grown back.  Well, let's do it a lot.  No, no, no.  Could you guys do all of it?  Yeah, I've had a little bit enough.  Oh, man.  All that hotness has left my body from the strippers.  Andy Rooney's neck skin is tighter.  That's from Nelson in Philly.  I think he's laughing out there.  We got to take a break, Anthony, huh? 
[02:13:00]  Whoa, man.  Still more to come, believe it or not.  Hopefully more ladies, please.  Ladies, please.  Girls, you got to help us.  Please.  I want a girl that isn't Patty.  Please.  And isn't a stripper.  Please.  We need one more lady.  We have a regular chick and not turn up in jeans.  Please.  I want a girl that's a regular girl.  No strippers with their inane babble.  No Patty with the cons of gravity.  Can we get some ladies, please?  If you're on your way or you're going to help us out, call us because we'll meet you in 
[02:13:30]  the lobby.  Please, please, please.  We need to do one or two more.  Right, Anthony?  Patty taking off after another rabbit with those toenails.  It's talons.  It's Shae Bush for Bush on the Opie and Anthony show today.  When we come back, funniest story of the day.  Mm-hmm.  Man eats underwear to beat breathalyzer.  Wow.  Details next.  Don't go to CNN for dick jokes.  Don't come here for the news.  The Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:14:00]  I like it when this show is dirty.  Hey, you're checking out the O&A show.  Yeah.  Edgar.  Yeah.  What's up, Edgar?  Hey, check it out.  Pat Croce, right?  Yeah.  So he's in Love Park giving a tour to this guy who wants to do a sitcom in Philadelphia.  And he's doing a tour and he's giving them a tour and everything else.  We're supposed to meet up with the police commissioner later on. 
[02:14:30]  So all these people are running up.  Pat, Pat, we want your autograph.  So all of a sudden this lady comes up.  Oh, my God.  That guy's got a knife.  Pat Croce turns around, sprints over.  There's these two guys fighting.  The guy's got a knife up to the other guy's throat.  He disarms them, takes the knife from the guy.  First of all, he couldn't believe that somebody had come over and stopped them.  Then they were all surprised because it's Pat Croce.  They look around.  There's like 150 people because all the people that were just getting all the autographs follow them over. 
[02:15:00]  So there's this big mob around these two guys that are fighting.  I don't know what he did with them.  I don't know if he let them go or what.  But he basically saved some guy's life today or yesterday.  Pat Croce is like a superhero.  He is a superhero.  The lady looks up and goes, Pat Croce, you're Batman.  He like scales bridges and saves people.  That's just another reason why the guy can't buy a beer in the city.  Everybody loves him.  That guy can kick some ass.  His leg was pretty much detached from his body below the knee.  He ran over there. 
[02:15:30]  The guy he was walking with said he had to stop running because he didn't want to get there at the same time Pat did.  He was scared.  But he said he saw Pat kind of slow down and evaluate the situation and just kind of lunge, did this karate move,  took the knife from the guy, and had both guys and the knife before he could blink.  Man, Pat is a good friend of the show.  Maybe he could call in and tell his side of the story.  Yeah.  This is something they were talking about.  Pat, there's a local sports radio station out here, and it was during a day today.  One of the guys on the show, Anthony Gargano, is a good friend of Pat's. 
[02:16:00]  And the guy that was with Pat, that was trying to get the TV show started, was the one who called up.  Edgar.  Yes.  Thanks for helping out the other team.  I greatly appreciate it.  Anytime.  Do you realize we need help with this show?  What are you talking about?  We don't need to advertise any other radio shows in any other cities right now.  You don't need any help in Philly.  Everybody loves ONA.  We're hurting a little bit, bro.  In Philly?  I know you were saying, Washington, you got like 110 people or something.  We had a rough week, Edgar. 
[02:16:30]  Yeah, let's just say that.  We had a rough week.  Even in Philly.  That's crazy.  So if you're enjoying the show, why don't you tell a friend?  We all listen.  All right, Edgar.  Everybody.  Thanks for that story.  That's a good one, man.  All right.  See if you can get Pat to call in.  That's pretty crazy.  I like to hear it from him.  If he's around, we'll definitely get him on the air.  All right.  All right.  Peace.  Bye.  Meanwhile.  Oh, yeah.  We should have the superhero.  How'd you go?  Dan from Hoboken.  What's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  What's up?  I left out was that Larry Bowe came out of nowhere and held a guy in a half Nelson until 
[02:17:00]  the cops came.  Philly reference, I thought.  I don't know.  This is like a rare phone call from Dan from Hoboken.  I know.  Well, unfortunately, it's probably going to be my last because Anthony read in some feedback  from yesterday where I told you guys that if you shaved Stalker Patty's patch, I was  never going to listen again.  Oh, no.  Oh, so you're not going to listen anymore.  I've got to stay true to my word.  You know, it's my bond.  What?  You're moving to Washington and this is what you have to do?  Yeah, dude.  You guys can go up to six listeners.  We're not doing too good in Washington. 
[02:17:30]  No.  It's okay.  I'm making the grass.  There you are.  I can't fail.  I can do no wrong.  All right, Dan.  I understand.  Thank you, Dan.  It's always a pleasure when you call the show.  Oh, yeah.  I'm sure.  All right.  Take it easy, man.  Bye.  Bye.  Dan from Hoboken.  Yeah.  Our listeners are leaving us in Washington faster than the Taliban in Afghanistan.  Oh, my God.  It's okay.  I think we're going to make this turn around and turn this thing around. 
[02:18:00]  John, what's going on?  You're next on the opening of the show.  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Hey.  I just wondering if you've got that weird feeling right now, like after the first time  you watched Faces of Death.  Perfect.  Perfect.  Perfect.  That's it.  Like a disturbing thing.  Like you couldn't stop watching, but like you can't stop thinking about it for a week.  All right, John, we're going to have to leave because there's a situation outside of the  studio, but that's a perfect, perfect analogy. 
[02:18:30]  The women were outside.  The women were.  Okay.  I don't know.  Hold on.  Hold on.  From the reaction and what Rick just wrote.  There is definitely a disturbance in the world.  He wrote, two girls have just arrived.  I am a denounce.  Is it denounce or denouncing?  You could denounce.  I'm going to denounce my citizenship, my American citizenship.  If what happens happens.  Look.  Look.  Come on. 
[02:19:00]  Come on.  We've suffered enough.  Could it be that the two girls that have arrived, I'm just telling from the reaction,  I cannot see.  I cannot see at all.  Is it the retard of Laverna Shirley?  Oh, no, no, no, no.  How are you?  With leather pants.  Son of a bitch.  Oh, great.  Okay, look, man.  If we have to stay on the air until midnight, we're doing it.  One hot chick has to show up now. 
[02:19:30]  Where, um, hold on.  Let me just play this little ditty and then we'll bring him in.  Well, Ant, great idea you came up with yesterday.  Hey.  Let's all hear it for Ant today.  Hey, look, I thought.  Say Bush for Bush.  Show your patriotism.  I thought it would bring out the best.  I am officially a communist.  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.  We're fat.  We're ugly.  We won't shut up and win all the 80s.  With someone, no one can take it. 
[02:20:00]  When we look in the mirror, we break it.  We'll give you nightmares all day long.  Like a couple of people, no one can take it.  Like a couple of weevils.  Not an ounce of sex appeal.  Make sense for us, no one can take it.  Make sense for us, it's not possible.  A warthog and Godzilla in leather pants.  Yes, we're both retarded, retarded.  Yes, we were born that way.  Yes, we're both retarded, retarded. 
[02:20:30]  Make any men turn gay.  And here they are, Anthony, Lady Di, and Marion.  How are you doing, guys?  Happy Thanksgiving to you.  Happy Thanksgiving.  How have you been?  Very good.  You got your Shave Your Bush for Bush hat on, sitting high on your head.  That's nice.  Lady Di, did someone punch you in the face?  No, why?

Lady Di, let me see those leather pants.  Back up a little.  I got a leather jacket now, guys.  What are you wearing there, Marion?  I got a leather jacket.  No, the pants.  Lady Di looks like W.C. Fields, man.  Why?  I just want to see what you're wearing.  I like seeing what you girls are wearing when you come in.  Does she have the W.C. Fields face or what? 
[02:21:30]  Oh, yes.  Yes.  Get away from me, kid.  You bother me.  She got too much makeup on, right?  Why did you put so much makeup on, Lady Di?  I look all right.  She put it on.  It's waiting for the train, guys.  You're a little red today.  You're a little red.  Look, she's powdering herself.  We had to walk there, Sean.  I got to ask you guys something.  Did she do the 100-yard dance in a 90-yard gym?  What are they giving away by Penn Station and by 42nd Street?  It's the Friday.

Oh, it is.  It's not as puffy.  It's not wavy.  It's growing.  I didn't do anything to my hair.  Lady Di, you're in the Christmas spirit. 
[02:22:30]  You look like a young Kris Kringle.  You're lost.  A young what?  Kris Kringle with the red nose.  Oh, okay.  I got a little jacket.  I just pounded my nose.  Don't ask me about the penis.  I'll never get a pair of pants.  Oh, my God.  I don't even know what they're saying.  Hold on.  Can we slow down?  First of all, Marion, you lost weight.  More weight.  Where?  In your big toe?  I mean.  Oh, Jesus.  How much weight did you lose?  About seven more pounds.  Oh, yes.  Seven?  Let me see.  I lost weight, too.  Put your jacket down. 
[02:23:00]  I don't give a flying F about you.  Marion, could you back?  Because I can't see there.  Could you just back up a little?  Yeah.  It's not always about Lady Di.  Let me see.  We're talking to Marion.  I thought I saw a little camel toe.  That's why.  I never said that.  You got a little camel toe.  Did you see that?  I don't have my period this week.  Thank God.

We haven't seen you since the Philly Roadshow.  Thank God.  Are you here to shave your bush for bush?  Uh, no.  That was already done.  I already did that.

I don't.  It's neat.  Hey, Anthony.  Okay?  Yeah.  Are we in a time warp?  Is it after midnight?  What happened to the hot bitches that we had in here?  I don't know.  I don't know.  It's not after midnight.  It's almost 25 after 6.  Let me tell you something.  You guys miss us.

There's chicks outside.  That was good.  Hey, we heard that patty shave.  They don't shut off, Opie.  Did she?  Marion, did you get stung by a bee or something?  No.  Why?  Why?  Stung by a bee?  What do you mean?  I can't see your eyes.  I look like I got...  Something's going on in your face.  It's all...  Not mine.  I'm not...  No, she looks all right.  Oh, I said Marion?  I said...

The Lady Di looks like she might have got stung by a couple of bees in her face.  Oh, no, no, no.  I was going to say...  Marion, I am looking at your fabulous breasts right now.  And I'm hanging.  Do you have a bra on?  Yeah, I do.  You do?  Thank the Lord.  All right.  I'm just wondering.  They're not hanging like they normally...  Yes, they are.  That is mine.  You know what it is?  Your breasts right at the top there, it looks like...  You ever see the Winter Olympics, the ski jump? 
[02:25:30]  Like, I'm seeing...  That's the agony of...  They are so...  Nothing.  I love that look.  That's nice.  It's very sloping.  I like it.  What about mine?  What about you?  I can't see yours through that leather suit of armor you're wearing.  Do you want me to take off the vest?  No.  What are you guys doing in the city?  Okay.  We're going to come over to visit and...  Ding-yang party.  And ding-yang party. 
[02:26:00]  That's right.  We're going to be out for a couple of drinks because I haven't really had a chance to get out.  Friday night.  Because I had surgery two weeks ago.  Oh, and don't talk about it.  No.  More surgery for you?  I don't know what it is.  She says she has it and then she says don't talk about it.  More.  Yeah.  They're still scraping.  Where was it?  Is it lady surgery?  Is that all you have to say?  Is it lady surgery?  Yeah.  Oh, they cut that open again?  They cut the lady out of her.  No.  They cut it open again, huh?  Well, I don't mind it.  I don't care what's going on with that, Diane.  Someone is shut as a public service.  Okay.  All right. 
[02:26:30]  What's the matter?  Lady Di is trying to protect her.  Look how good friends they are.  No, no, no.  That's right.  We are good friends.  We are.  Can you still, theoretically, can you still bear children?  Yeah.  Oh, you can?  You have all your working parts?  I can, too.  That's no problem.  Lady Di, I don't even care.  Every year, I don't care.  Why wait a minute?  What about me?  What's going on with this?  You can't bear children because that would require an excited man.  There we go.  As long as this show, I keep up on my yearly checkups.  Oh, and they found a little something that they had to take care of.  That's it, yeah. 
[02:27:00]  Like a fibroid or something?  No.  They found a polyp?  Nope.  They found a Buick?  Nope.  They found...  No, not in there.  I am stupefied.  Come on.  One more lady has to show up.  Yeah, we need a girl.  I want to go home in a good mood.  You can ask Diane to shave.  No, Diane has shaved.  We've been informed already.  I'm fine.  Are you sure?  Yes.  You know what they use?  Those daisy cutters that the military uses.  They drop it.  It clears out a patch that you can use for landing a Sikorsky.  So, hey, Opie, I heard about your incident on the subway. 
[02:27:30]  Yeah, how's your toe?  How was your toe?  You're funny.  You know why?  Did you see what Stinky just did?  He goes to give Maddie a lady down to Mike and he slammed her in the nose with it.  Yeah, you did.  Because he tried to eat it.  How is your toe?  How are you doing?  Because you get like, hey, I'm like that way, too.  For those of you listening, picture a disgusted look on Opie's face as he just remains silent.  Looking at them with the...  I'm asking him.  I know.  I can see that.  The butthead look on his face. 
[02:28:00]  I see you got...  Hey, who are you?  Hi, how are you doing?  Hi, Dad.  How are you?  Who's that?  Hey, Yang Yang Party.  Ladies, thank you.  Thank you, ladies.  Unless you're going to be part of the Shave Bush for Bush, we have to move on.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Not me.  All right.  Not me.

The sideways hat.  I know.  I look good in hats.  Are you going to go out and ying-yang party?  I look good in all of anything.  Are you going to ying-yang party with that hat?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, we are going to ying-yang party.  Give me a hat.  She'd look good in a hole.  I like Mary.  Thank you.  When you guys are out, are you scoping out for guys when you're out?  No, no.  Let me tell you.  I know Lady Di's on the prowl.  Not me.  Are you the C-blocker for her? 
[02:29:00]  Yeah.  I got to give the guys a third degree before they pick her up.  Jesus, please.  No, you don't.  There's two skinny girls looking to go out with you two.  Figure that one out.  Oh, Diane, you know what I am.  Really?  Where are they?  Oh, come on.  They always have the fat one with them.  Oh, yeah.  Yes.  All right, ladies.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  There they go.  We're going to take control of our show.  Thank you.  Ladies, thank you.  There they go.  Mary, hold the door open for two of them. 
[02:29:30]  As they walk away, I'm reminded of every creature I hit in EverQuest.  They look just like all of the bad things in EverQuest that you have to kill.  Well, Marion hits you for ten points of damage.  Don't we have like a Jim Brewer bit we could go to now?  Let's go home.  Your target resists affliction. 
[02:30:00]  Oh, brother.  What a mess.  I was hoping.  You know something?  I saw Rick write two chicks have just arrived.  I'm like, great.  We got two more girls to do this.  You ladies have let us down a little bit.  I can only think maybe we're responsible because of the nice things we said about the ladies that did show up.  But they're strippers.  Girls, we're just looking for regular girls to come down and we've been very nice to the regular girls.  Charles, what's up?  Hey.  Oh, and hey.  Yeah, what's up, Charles? 
[02:30:30]  I want to offer my services to Patty.  Oh, are you a pimp?  No, for the hammer toes.  Yeah, exactly.  I thought it was Dr. Kevorkian when he said he was a doctor and wanted to give his services to Patty.  Well, we'll see how the surgery turns out.  But I'm a board certified foot surgeon.  I'm a doctor.  I'm in Manhattan and Westchester.  And if she wants me to do a surgery, I'll do it for nothing.  Oh, yeah?  All right.  Hold on.  Rick's going to get info.  You come in and you check out Patty and we'll do the whole thing.  We'll do the whole thing, all right?  No problem.  You deal with the hammer toes and stuff? 
[02:31:00]  Whatever she's got, I can deal with.  All right.  I don't know if there's anything you can do for her.  We'll see, though.  All right.  Hold on.  All right.  Cool.  Anthony, really fast.  It's a quick story.  God, please.  One more lady before we leave today.  Yeah.  Come on.  One more lady.  Come on, ladies.  One more lady.  I could hear them babbling through the soundproof door.  Come on.  Come on.  Ugh.  Anthony, man eats underwear to beat breathalyzer.  I've never heard of this one before.  Is there a town called Stettler?  Where's Stettler?  I don't know. 
[02:31:30]  All right.  And Stettler, an 18-year-old Stettler man tried to eat his underwear in the hope that  the cotton fabric would absorb alcohol before he took a breathalyzer test, Anthony.  David Zerfla was subsequently acquitted of a charge of impaired driving because he blew  .08, the legal limit.  Blow.  But the testimony broke up, made people laugh in court, Anthony.  Uh, Mr. Zerfla was collared by Bill Robinson after he ran from his vehicle, which had been  seen, uh, weaving down the highway.  Ah. 
[02:32:00]  This is what this guy did.  While sitting in the back of the patrol car, Mr. Zerfla tried to eat his shorts.  What is that gonna do?  He ripped the crotch out of his shorts, stuffed the fabric in his mouth, and then spit it out.  Ah!  A class of law students from, uh, in, in, in court, uh, a class of law students who  were in court as observers was, uh, they were removed by the teacher when testimony enlivened  the proceedings, meaning they were laughing uncontrollably, Anthony. 
[02:32:30]  The grade 11 and 12 students had difficulty maintaining composure.  Of course.  People were leaving the courtroom with tears in their eyes, trying not to laugh.  He ripped the crotch out of his, you know something, shoved it in his mouth, thinking  it would soak up some alcohol before they gave him the breathalyzer.  That's, like, sick, because it's his underwear, and you don't know what's in there, but does  anyone else have a problem, like, I'm freaking out at the thought of cotton fabric in my teeth.  You know things that give you the heebie-jeebies, like blackboard scratching?  I, I, I, I'm kind of, I enjoy all that.  I'm freaked out by that.  It's like, give me this, I, I, I, I enjoy all that, Anthony. 
[02:33:00]  Do you?  Yeah, just for a goof, I get a big, big ball of, uh, tinfoil.  Ah!  I throw it in my mouth, and, ooh, ooh.  Ooh, chomp, chomp down a little bit.  Oh!  Yeah, that kind of, just for a laugh, it gives me the heebie-jeebies.  You ever take that tinfoil and really just grind the teeth when it's in there?  Okay, look, I can't even, I can't even talk about it.  I can't even talk.  What about, uh, just, uh, putting a big old cotton ball in your mouth and chewing down a 
[02:33:30]  little bit?  No, see, that's, yeah, I don't like that.  It's getting me freaked out.  Wow, what about, like, uh, like, uh, like taking the Freddy Krueger, uh, glove and,  and just, uh, down the, down the, the, the chalkboard?  Oh, oh.  The blackboard?  Oh.  Eee!  Oh!  What about when you go in a pizza parlor and the, and the, uh, the tables and chairs,  they don't have the, the, the rubbers on them, so when the people are moving their chairs  around, it makes that god-awful noise that goes right through you?  That isn't so bad.  The cotton, though, is killing me. 
[02:34:00]  The cotton?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hey, kids, try the tinfoil.  It's lovely.  You used to do that.  I used to do that as, like, a kid.  You'd challenge it.  It's like, okay, back down on this.  It would send such a shot of pain up your, up your skull.  And, uh, Brad from CBUS there, uh, he goes, holy S, Opie's an EQ addict.  No.  I'm the EQ addict.  What's it?  EverQuest.  Oh, yeah.  No, that was that guy.  The guy confuses us.  I hate when people confuse us.  I know.  Joe, what's up?  O and A, how we doing?  All right. 
[02:34:30]  Listen, man, we can't expect a ratings renaissance with hammer toes and leather pants.  Ratings renaissance.  Oh, really?  I know.  I'll give you from the beginning, guys.  I'll be sticking with you.  Thank you.  Through the hammer toes.  See, D.C., listen to this guy from New York.  He sticks with us through the thick and the thin.  Right.  All right, guys.  Have a good one.  He doesn't need to go to a stupid news station to get updates on the war.  Thank you, Joe.  All right.  You can do that after we're off the air.  Right.  We all know what's happening. 
[02:35:00]  We'll let you know.  We'll fill you in.  We'll tell you.  You know something?  We'll even tell you when to turn to the news station.  Don't worry about it.  All right.  Got those two free.  Kim from D.C.  Kim?  Yes.  What's up, Kim?  Hey, how are you, love?  How are you?  How are you?  I'm fine.  Thank you for asking.  Good.  What are you doing today?  Actually, since I can't come to New York, I'm shaving my bush here.  Ah, look at that.  The ladies are taking it upon themselves at their homes, Anthony. 
[02:35:30]  And if I'm in D.C. and I love you guys and I tell all my friends about you and, like,  I'm black and I can convert my black friends to listen to you guys.  Damn, I knew it.  I knew it.  I was going to say that.  You had a little soul in your voice, baby.  Of course.  Yeah.  No, my brother.  Huh?  No, my brother.  No, my brother.  Hey, Kim, that's a great razor.  Can I borrow it?  Sure.  You can use it for whatever you like.  No, my brother.  You gots to buy your own.

I like a Hershey bar on a hot summer day.  Yeah, but chocolate melts.  I like that.  I like that.  That's my favorite black color.  I like almost purple.  Really?  Yeah, I like being able to, uh, I like being able to see my reflection in your forehead.  Oh, yeah, have you ever, you know, been with a black girl?  Yeah.  How'd you like it? 
[02:36:30]  I was able to look at my sex faces in her forehead.  Anthony, I'm ready to do some, uh, I'm ready to do a local reference?  Yeah.  Uh, to clue the people into how black you like them?  Yeah.  You like them Bruce Smith black?  Oh, okay.  Very good.  How about George Wallace black?  George Wallace.  Yeah, we like the George Wallace.  You like them that black?  I know, we like George Wallace.  Oh, yeah, he is pretty funny.  He's a very cool cat.  Yeah, he's kind of black.  A little too black for me.  Hey, Kim, what else do you look like?

Hey, can you tell us a picture, Kim?  Sure, I can.  All right.  I have blonde hair, so.  You have blonde hair?  Yep.  Natural?  Of course not.  Of course not.  But, hey, it looks better on me than some of those trashy strippers you might have in there.  What kind of products are you using on your hair, baby?  Actually, I just use a little water and mousse. 
[02:38:00]  It's because Master was creeping up in the cabin, so I got a little curls going on.  Mm-hmm.  You get some of them baby hairs hanging down from your forehead?  Hell no.  That's Bama.  You see that stuff?  Like, some of the black ladies.  That's real Bama.  They got the straight hair.  They use a lot of the processing on it, so it's straight.  They use a lot of gel and then brush it and then lay it down with, like, a hair thing.  Yeah, and then, like, the baby hairs that are flying out right at the hairline, they'll wax those things down,  so it kind of looks like, uh, it looks a little weird. 
[02:38:30]  In D.C., we call that Bama.  Bama?  Yeah, straight Bama.  Bama.  Bama.  Like you from Alabama.  That's Bama.  Yeah, that's your word for the week.  Hey, Kim, we like you.

[02:43:00]  Very good.  Let's see.  I learned Patty knows Gene.  Patty knows Gene?  Hygiene.  Oh!  I have good hygiene.  She doesn't even put the accent on the right syllable.  Isn't it hygiene?  I have good hygiene.  Hi, guys.  How you doing?  What's up, Joe?  Hey, I just want to let you guys know, regardless of what D.C. says, we still love you in New York.  Thank you.  We've never forgotten New York.  I've been busy all day at work.  I didn't get to turn the show on until 6.30. 
[02:43:30]  But I still managed to learn that I didn't miss anything today.  You bastard.  God, guys.  Hey, you want a copy of Kid Rock's latest CD, Cocky?  Sure.  Okay, Cocky will be in stores this Tuesday, but we've got a copy for you.  Stay on the line, all right?  All right, man.  All right, cool.  Let's go to Dan.  Dan, what did you learn on the show today?  I learned that Anthony spends way too much time checking out black men.  Black men?  Black men?  Well, you guys kept talking about the color of the skin. 
[02:44:00]  He's always kept throwing, you know...  Oh, black men references.  Oh, the black skin color.  Yeah.  Very good, Joe.  I added Florida Evans in there.  Joe, what's up?  Joe, what up?  Hey, bro.  I learned that mesh caps are never cool.  Never.  And I learned that Marion is going to be at the next Olympics as a ski jump.  Yeah.  Very good, bro.  I learned we're going to turn this thing around.  We will turn it around.  Dennis, what's up?  Yeah, the difference between Stalker Patty and a bald eagle is an eagle can fly. 
[02:44:30]  Yeah.  Good job.  Right?  Hey, the shaving ladies are in here to say goodbye.  Turnips never look good in jeans.  Thank you so much for having us.  We had so much fun.  And please come visit us.  You can get us on our website at nyhairremoval.com.  And we're located in Heartsdale.  nyhairremoval.com.  Yeah, absolutely.  Come visit us.  Or at the Woodstock Spa in East Norwich, Long Island.  Or in Heartsdale, New York at the New York Center for Advanced Hair Removal.  Thank you, guys.  There you go.  We had a blast.  When is Brad Pitt going to be on Friends with you? 
[02:45:00]  Oh, you know what?  As soon as possible, I hope.  Can we leave our phone number for you guys?  Oh, what does that mean?  I can't accept that.  We're going a little too far.  Why not?  914-328-9888.  Give us a call.  9888.  Thanks so much, guys.  Thanks so much for having us.  Cool.  Yeah, ladies, thank you for putting up with some of that you had to put up with.  You know what I mean.  Come on.  Don't be nice.  It's nothing we haven't seen.  Don't be nice.  Come on in.  We'll treat you.  It's like the iron workers here in New York.  Usually they're putting up buildings and it's a happy moment. 
[02:45:30]  But then occasionally they've got to go down to ground zero and do things that maybe aren't as pleasant,  even though it's the same type of work.  That's exactly the situation you were put in.  It wasn't that bad.  It was fun.  Anthony, it's Jameek from Brooklyn.  I learned today Patty sucked the hot out of Opie.  Strippers are best in their native habitat.  And doctors are still trying to remove that little Kittner boy from Marion's Hatchett.  Maybe that's it.  They found a license plate. 
[02:46:00]  It appears I came up from the warmer water to the Gulf.  Let's say goodbye to Curly Fry Guy who made the t-shirts today.  Shalom, my friend.  Anything for you guys.  Anything.  All right, cool.  Havan Aguila.  I think we're out of show, huh?  Yep.  Out of show?  Yeah, we're done.  Ski.  Thank you so much.  I know.  I haven't said that in a while.  I have.  Have a great weekend, Anthony.  Yes, you do.  I'll have a full report on Harry Potter.  Oh, are you going to Harry Potter?  My girlfriend has already gotten tickets for Harry Potter. 
[02:46:30]  Do you have your blankie?  Are you going to be taking...  Is this a blankie movie you're going to?  I think we'll be taking in the 3 a.m.  showing.  Yeah, I know.  It's supposed to be packed.  It's been running since, what, 8 this morning?  Uh.  I got tickets for the 3 a.m. showing, I believe.  Yeah, sure.  Boy, it's such an important movie.  We had to get our tickets in advance, Anthony.  Go the first day it comes out.  You're going to be sitting in a theater that smells like baby diapers.  Exactly.  Mm-mm.  Hey, we got more copies of Kid Rock's latest CD, Cocky.  Cocky, yeah, we could say that because it's the name of the album.  Wow.  Hey, I thought I was just throwing something up there. 
[02:47:00]  Cocky will be in stores this Tuesday, but we got some for some random callers right now.  Anywhere.  Anywhere.  Anywhere, because we'll mail it to you.  So, if you're calling from another city, please give us a call and try to win the Kid Rock CD, okay?  It's not like you said.  It doesn't work.  It didn't work?  Yeah, it's not like you said.  What happened, Ant?  What if someone screwed up my sound?  That's freaking, we got to go.  We got to go.  Okay.  All right.  I'll do it Monday.  Monday at 3.  You guys have, you guys have, you guys have redefined debauchery.  It's like a vaudeville show on acid. 
[02:47:30]  Opie Anthony.  Put your sack into it.  Listen after ONA for Ron and Fez.  1027 WNEW.  Ah, Anthony, Sam Adams.  Sorry.  Sam Adams.  Yes, Sam Adams.  You know what they got going?
