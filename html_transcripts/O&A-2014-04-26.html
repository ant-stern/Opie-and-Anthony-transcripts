<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a discussion about a WorldStarHipHop video, which segued into a conversation about lucid dreaming and sleep paralysis.  Listeners called in sharing their personal experiences, including feeling unable to move while seemingly awake.  Dr. Steve, a therapist, phoned in to explain the physiological causes, attributing it to brain chemicals released during REM sleep.  The hosts debated this explanation's relevance to hitting snooze alarms.  The show included commercial breaks interspersed with discussions about the Coachella lineup, Tom Petty's "Loser" song (featuring Joe Piscopo and Eddie Murphy), and more listener calls about sleep paralysis, out-of-body experiences, and children claiming to see deceased relatives—one caller even recounted a dream about Casper the Friendly Ghost defecating.

A significant segment analyzed a viral Wheel of Fortune video showcasing a contestant's disastrous decisions.  The hosts found the contestant's repeated blunders hilarious.  Further listener calls followed, discussing the Wheel of Fortune video, children communicating with deceased relatives, and a viral video of a news reporter being repeatedly interrupted by drunk college students celebrating a hockey victory.  The reporter repeatedly said, "I've got to send it back to you live." One caller shared a story about his daughter and niece claiming to have spoken to their deceased grandmother on the phone.  The segment concluded with a mysterious therapist, "Gorilla Bob," promising an explanation for children seeing dead relatives but ultimately refusing to give it, calling it a new bit.

The show then shifted to a discussion of Long Island Medium, Teresa Caputo, and the manipulative nature of psychics. The hosts mocked tweets from Caputo's fans.  A caller shared their experience at a John Edwards reading, highlighting its perceived fraudulent nature.  This transitioned into discussions about sunburn, a humorous tweet about *The Brady Bunch*, and a caller's experience at a Long Island floatation therapy center. Another caller recounted their experience at a John Edwards event, emphasizing his seemingly knowing personal details.

A significant portion of the broadcast was dedicated to the unexpected death of comedian Otto and George (his ventriloquist dummy).  The hosts expressed shock and sadness, sharing anecdotes about Otto's comedic style, struggles with addiction, and personality. They played an audio clip of Otto’s performance, notably a darkly humorous bit about Dorothy's death in *The Wizard of Oz*.  Numerous callers shared memories and stories of Otto.  The show continued to discuss Otto's career and lack of deserved recognition, playing further audio clips and reflecting on his legacy.  This remembrance continued into a later segment, incorporating a caller's story about Otto's encounter with John Lennon, where Lennon gave Otto a paltry tip and an elbow. Another caller recounted Otto's impressive memory of obscure celebrity details.  Joe DeRosa called in, sharing a funny story about Otto's puppet insulting an audience member.  A clip from David Letterman's show showcased Otto adapting his act for a cleaner audience.  The segment also included discussions of *The Godfather* and a woman accused of killing seven babies.

The show then took a personal turn with one of the hosts graphically describing a recent experience with a strap-on, detailing the physical discomfort of anal sex, including specific details about lubrication and a near-defecation incident.  This was followed by a brief interview with Amy Schumer.  The conversation covered her modest rider requirements, experiences with uncommunicative drivers, the unrealistic thinness ideal in modeling, differing male and female perspectives on female attractiveness, financial exploitation in relationships, the low pay of Olympic athletes, and Schumer's experiences with exceptionally large penises.

The final portion of the show focused on Amy Schumer's observations about the portrayal of women in media and the societal emphasis on material possessions.  She discussed racial stereotypes in casting calls and the challenges of maintaining authenticity and healthy relationships while navigating fame.  The conversation touched upon Louis C.K.'s behavior, personal insecurities, early life experiences, the importance of a wide social circle, and the link between personal insecurities and a career in comedy.  Humorous tangents included Schumer's alleged piranha ownership, a discussion about a walking fish, and a 3D Piranha movie.  The hosts also made several sexually suggestive comments, including jokes referencing a hypothetical pregnancy involving Amy Schumer and a Black athlete.  The show concluded with advertisements.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  All those niggas look like birds.  Yeah, but when it was on WorldStarHibbop, the comments were crazy.  Yeah, it pops up once.  I was just surprised someone tweeted me it was on the front page of the road.  It went everywhere again this weekend.  Yeah, that's awesome.  Mikey and Boldy more.  Mike.  Hey, fellas.  This one will scare the shit out of you.  I had a buddy who learned how to be elucid.  Hold on, sorry.  Go ahead.  Yeah, my friend learned how to be a lucid dreamer as a kid because he had nightmares that kept him up every night for his sleep specials, taught him how to do it. 
[00:00:30]  So like a moron, I tried to do it myself just based on what he learned.  The problem I had, though, is I would feel like I was wide awake, like my eyes are open, I'm looking in my bedroom, and I couldn't move for a minute.  Yeah, I have that, too.  I've heard people that have had that.  I've had that many, many times over the years, hundreds of times, made thousands.  Yeah, you try to scream, you try to move, you just can't do it.  It feels like an hour, but it's probably like two minutes.  It's that REM sleep thing, I think. 
[00:01:00]  Sorry, but I think that that's the way your body protects you from hurting yourself and your dreams.  It is.  Like, you can't move because that way you don't injure yourself while you're dreaming.  Yeah.  Thanks, buddy.  I'm punching out.  Okay.  But that has happened to you, Jimmy?  I can't tell you how many times I've woken up and felt like I know I'm like, it's like a weird, like...  Whoa!  That's what it feels like, like my whole body is buzzing, silently buzzing, and I can't  move, and I can't do anything, and I'm trapped. 
[00:01:30]  And it's a very real feeling moment.  Like, if I think of myself falling out of a plane, I'll feel the wind.  It'll be an extremely lucid moment, but then I come out of it.  Wow.  That's just waking up, I think.  Oh, man.  Nothing beats that falling in a dream feeling.  Whoa!  You get all fucked up.  What is that?  Holy shit.  Like, I've been driving...  You're driving a car, and you're going really much too fast for the road, and then you fly  off a cliff, and that feeling you get when you're just like, oh, shit, I'm fucking falling. 
[00:02:00]  Right.  Then you gotta wake up before you hit, or you die.  Or you're really dead.  I don't know if that's bullshit, by the way.  Steve the therapist is back.  Oh.  I'm better than ever.  Back!  Jimmy's absolutely right.  When you enter a certain level of sleep and you're dreaming, your brain releases a chemical  that, in effect, paralyzes you, obviously, except for your breathing, so you don't act  out your dreams.  That's why, in many of your dreams, you feel like you can't run, you can't fight back, 
[00:02:30]  you can't chase after the bad guy, that type of thing.  What chemical does it release?  I wonder if that's tied into central sleep apnea.  I don't know the name of the chemical offhand.  Oh.  Wow.  Wow.  That's crazy.  So we're all paralyzed at some time during our sleep?  Except for essential functions, yes.  I don't like that.  That's a little weird.  Well, how come if you wake up?  How come if you wake up, then you can move? 
[00:03:00]  Yeah.  It's that instant that it goes away?  It depends on the stage of sleep that you wake up in.  I think everybody could probably remember waking up and it taking a second or two before  they're able to move.  The anecdote...  Then how are we hitting our alarm clocks?  Yeah.  Well, we usually...  If you've got this paralysis, your alarm goes off, everyone hits it.  Yeah.  Hits that snooze quickly.  Yeah.  Well, it's the level of sleep you're waking up in.  But I'm... 
[00:03:30]  But what if you're waking up in the middle of fucking this chemical thing?  With all the people that set alarm clocks, you've got to think a percentage of those  people would not be able to hit their snooze alarm because they still have that paralysis.  Comment?  Well, it's the question...  Face!  It's also the question of how long is the alarm clock...  You've been served!  ...before they wake up.  Oh, come on.  I won an award for fastest alarm shutter offer.  Ooh.  What is it?  Hanging up on the wall?  Yes.  It's just an alarm clock with a hand on it.  Made of solid gold. 
[00:04:00]  That would rule.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I'm thinking...  You're with me on this one, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, there'd be a lot of people going, fuck, I can't hit that snooze alarm.  Oh, it wears off instantly?  Yeah, I don't know.  I don't buy that.  I think that's some kind of bullshit.  I say nerds.  And then how come you can't roll over?  You know, you roll over in your sleep.  You fucking...  How about we get Dr. Steve on the phone?  Grab the pillow and fucking give it a little...  Bite it.  Bite it. 
[00:04:30]  Let's do a little Dr. Steve after the break.  You know what?  Dr. Steve knows everything.  You're right.  All right.  And video of the fart king.  I don't know what that means.  Video of me?  Yes.  Tom in Tucson.  Stay through the break if you can.  And we'll talk to you.  Relax.  The Opie and Anthony show will be right back on Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.

[00:14:00]  Oh, wow, that would be amazing.  Oh, no.  What?  Leonardo DiCaprio.  Coachella.  First of all, that Coachella looks like the worst fucking place to be.  Oh, my God.  I know I'm way, way out of the demo.  If Opie's Nana, the grandpa is complaining about the kids' music.  Way out of the demo.  Yeah, who's at Coachella this year?  The Dell Twitter pictures.  I saw the lineup and was like, what the fuck? 
[00:14:30]  I know Fatboy Slim.  That was about it.  Jared Leto was talking at the MTV Movie Awards last night about wanting to head back to Coachella.  Yeah, I saw that little segment.  How were the awards?  Were they good?  No.  I mean, even I'm out of the demo at this point.  Outcast, Mews, Arcade Fire.  I mean, Outcast was the big one.  Right.  Because, you know.  Yeah, Mews, Arcade Fire, Queen of the Stone Age, Skrillex, Pharrell, Lorde, Foster the People, MGMT.  Wait, Pet Shop Boys. 
[00:15:00]  Pet Shop Boys.  Kid Cudi.  Eastern Town, those guys.  Nas.  Eastern, Western.  I think so.  Right.  MGMT, nice.  Beck.  Whatever happened to MGMT?  Motorhead.  Calvin Harris.  Answer my question.  I think that...  They faded away a little bit?  Yeah, I think EDM kind of took off and kind of left MGMT behind.  A lot of letters. 
[00:15:30]  Motorhead was at Coachella?  Where do you see that?  Oh, yeah.  Yep.  Lana Del Rey.  A lot of good bands.  Why are the band names getting smaller and smaller?  They're less important.  Maybe I was looking at the other stages.  Because, man, it just looked like a fucking collection of shit.  What do you got back?  Bunch of stupid hipsters.  You like the back rap?  Yeah, to a point.  You ever hear that Loser song?  I heard that one.  Yeah.  What are you implying? 
[00:16:00]  It's a big song.  Oh.  Is that your Loser band?  Is that the one?  Yeah.  You know what I heard over the weekend?  Tom Petty.  You're jamming me.  Right.  It's like, what did Joe Piscopo ever do to deserve to be in that song?  Take back Joe Piscopo!  Maybe he was a fucking psychic.  I don't know.  That's a very good question.  Yeah.  What the fuck did Joe Piscopo ever do to deserve to be in that? 
[00:16:30]  We've got to ask Joe Piscopo about that song next time he comes in here.  Yeah, I remember, guys.  Yes.  He did that.  But it's cool.  He's a great guy.  Roland, get Joe Piscopo on the phone.  No!  Let's do it today.  Yeah, I want to find out.  Yeah, we haven't talked to Joe in a while.  He put that in the song, and it was at the same time me and Eddie.  He used to be like Eddie was in the song, too, so you...  Oh, God.  That's a fucking good Piscopo song.  That's really good Piscopo.  Oh, I love Joe Piscopo. 
[00:17:00]  That's very good.  Take back Joe Piscopo!  Take back Eddie Murphy!  Give him all some place to go!  Oh, Eddie Murphy's in that song, too?  You're jamming me.  Yeah.  Wait, is it over at Coachella, or is it still happening?  No, it's just this weekend.  It's coming?  No, it's already over now.  Then they do it again.  It's done skiing.  Then they do it again.  They do it twice now.  They do it twice.  So next weekend, it's again.  Did Motorhead play or no?  Yes, Motorhead played last night.  Oh, they did. 
[00:17:30]  Okay.  But they're going to play again next week.  It's the exact same lineup.  Same lineup.  Twice?  Next week.  Oh, that's cool.  Because it sells out so fast.  Why not do it?  So they all have to go back there?  That's right.  Where is it?  It's in California.  It's in the desert.  Yeah.  Oh, hold on a minute.  People know why Piscopo's in that song.  Let's say hi to Gil, it looks like, in Atlanta.  No, it's Bill.  But anyways.  Oh, Gil.  Look how it's Bill.  I know.  All right.  Anyways.  Petty said that he opened up a Washington Post style section. 
[00:18:00]  And on the cover of that, on the front page of that, was Piscopo, Murphy, and somebody else.  And that's why he needed some names to put in that song.  And that was the first thing he saw.  And then Murphy, Eddie Murphy, had a big shit fit about it and said that he was pissed off at Petty for using his name.  Was he bashing them, or no?  Well, it kind of was.  Well, he's naming a bunch of stuff in the song that is like bullshit, kind of pop culture crap. 
[00:18:30]  And so with St. Piscopo and Eddie Murphy, I could see that pissing him off.  I don't think he is.  Yeah.  Eddie Murphy was at some press conference, and they asked him about that.  And his response was, I don't give a shit what Petty says.  I don't listen to his music because I'm black.  I think he called him something, too, like some buck-toothed fucking hillbilly or some shit.  Well, let's hear that part of the song.  Right?  Where is your jamming me? 
[00:19:00]  Your jamming me.  All right, guys.  Punching out.  Thanks.  Thank you.  Remember this?  Take back Vanessa Redgrave and Joe Piscopo.  Oh, take them back?  Place to go. 
[00:19:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, he's just, you're jamming me.  I don't know what that meant.  I mean, like, you're bullshitting me.  You're fucking me.  You're fucking with me.  Little known fact.  Yeah.  Without Tom Petty?  Yeah.  There wouldn't be Jay-Z.  What?  That is a fact, my friend.  How so?  That's to know.  Yep.  I'm not going to explain it to you.  That is true.  Nick in Syracuse.  Nick.  What?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, what's up, Nick?  What do you got? 
[00:20:00]  Hey.  Jimmy was talking about the sleep paralysis.  Yeah.  This guy on Art Bell's show, for like, whatever, however long he was on Sirius, this one guy,  Dr. Albert Taylor, came on and talked about how, like, that happened to him all the time,  and he was able to, apparently, he could be full of shit, but he said that he used that  state to, like, have out-of-body experiences and shit, and he, like, went out and did an  experiment, like, he went to one place and looked at him. 
[00:20:30]  Is that like a gum?  Yeah, exactly like that.  But, yeah, I don't know.  Apparently, like, he said it's possible and shit, like, you could, he ended up, he was  afraid of it at first, then he, like, used it to do all kinds of crazy shit with it  and go to different dimensions and all that.  So, I was wondering if Jimmy ever did that or if he ever was doing that.  No, and neither did he.  You know, it's just, you feel like you can rise out of your body, though.  I understand why some would say it feels like that, but it's, no, you don't have out-of-body  experience. 
[00:21:00]  I swear to you, when I was younger, living with my parents, early teens, maybe, I swear,  I have this, this, I felt like I left my body and walked into the bathroom.  Were you comfortably numb?  Is that it?  There is no pain.  No?  No, I, but I have a memory that I've, I feel like that absolutely happened.  Huh.  But I don't know how to explain it.  Was I just dreaming?  Could have been a dream. 
[00:21:30]  I felt like I went to the bathroom, but not with my body.  How do you explain that?  Did you piss yourself?  You were just dreaming.  Yeah, maybe you were just dreaming.  Just a dream.  Yeah.  Especially when you're a kid, you don't even get the fucking, what the dream is, so you  think it's real.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Sure.  Sure you do.  You was just dreaming.  I remember that, Gregorio.  No, you thought I went to the bathroom.  I was like, no, you're just not used to that pressure in your hiney.  Oh, man.  That was my finger. 
[00:22:00]  He doesn't even try to be subtle.  I know.  No, I was helping him.  I was taking his temperature.  Oh, okay.  He had a fever.  As long as you were helping.  Your head was warm.  Yeah.  So I wet my finger and I put it in your bottom.  I said, let me see how warm you are there, Gregorio.  Oh.  Your little feet was kicking in your PJs like you were swimming.  It's horrible.  This isn't fun anymore.  Yeah.  Quick question.  When you took that out-of-body shit, like, were you able to smell it? 
[00:22:30]  Like, you guys were talking about smelling a dream?  I don't even remember if I took a leak or any of that stuff.  I just have this memory from when I was a child that I've kept with me for many, many years  where I truly felt like I left my body and, for whatever reason, walked into the bathroom.  And I'm sure it was probably, you know, just a dream or whatever.  No way to know.  I mean, it could be true, though.  Who knows?  And I always thought to myself over the years, wow, I really would like to do that again. 
[00:23:00]  It was cool.  I remember one dream that I had when I was fucking, like, five years old, and it was  when Casper the Friendly Ghost took a shit.  I was hanging out with Casper the Friendly Ghost, and he took a shit on the sidewalk.  And I was like, Casper went to the bathroom.  And you remember this from being five?  I remember it was like, it's definitely the first dream I ever remember having.  And I remembered it for so long because I thought it was the funniest thing.  As I got older, I kind of remembered it. 
[00:23:30]  And I was like, I remember, like, Casper taking a shit.  Casper the Friendly Ghost.  Did Casper have a bunch of friends that looked like him and they were on horseback?  Let's go to Mark on Long Island.  Thank you for that other call there.  Marky!  Yeah, what's going on?  Hey, man.  I'm in the clinic.  Yeah, in college, I used to take Adderall, and that shit would cause a lot of sleep paralysis. 
[00:24:00]  And I would take it to study.  And I would see myself from across the room, and I would take naps in the study hall.  It was weird.  Yeah, you're probably just thinking you saw yourself.  Yeah.  All right.  Time to nap.  Dreams are weird, yeah.  Right.  That's what it is.  Yeah, exactly.  I think a lot of people, when they have these spiritual awakenings and after-death experiences,  but then they come back, I think that's all some kind of a dream state thing. 
[00:24:30]  You know, once you start crossing wires in your head, you could, you know, it can make  you believe anything.  You could see things, hear things, smell things.  You're in certain places where you're not.  You confuse your memory of things with the actual reality of where you are now.  So, it could fucking short-circuit all kinds of shit up there when you've got stress going  on.  Just made up of a lot of goo and some electric currents.  We're a goopy machine.  It's a goo machine.  Instead of metal and wires and everything, it's all goopy stuff, but it works the same 
[00:25:00]  way.  Bishop in Chicago.  Bishop!  Good morning, gentlemen.  Hey.  I've had the sleep paralysis probably five or six times in my life.  It's the weirdest thing.  You just wake up.  You cannot move your eyes.  You can't control your breathing.  You can't scream.  You can't move.  And then what happens to me is I just basically get in such a panic, I pass back out.  Whoa.  And then wake up covered in sweat.  You pass out?  Yeah.  It's just like such a panic feeling, then it just all goes black, and then you wake back 
[00:25:30]  up.  And every time it's happened, I've been just covered in sweat, and it's not a fun thing.  Wow.  That is really strange.  We're getting no answers to any of this stuff, by the way.  Because there really aren't any.  Where's our experts?  There's a lot of theories as far as dreams go.  I understand that.  When I was a kid, it was probably just a dream, but I remember it being that I really, truly  felt I left my body and walked into the bathroom. 
[00:26:00]  I fucked up.  So just explain that.  You can't just say, well, it's a dream.  But why is it a dream to the point where you really believe you actually did that?  Yeah.  That's what I'm trying to figure out.  I never forgot that one.  It's one of the only things I really, truly remember as far as dreams and things like  that go.  I had a fever as a kid, and I remember being a little delirious and thinking that I was  doing certain things, you know, walking around when I wasn't.  Did your hands swell up like two balloons?  Yes.  I had a fever as a kid, and I remember being a little delirious and thinking that I was doing 
[00:26:30]  all your dreams.  It's a good song.  Sure.  Dave in Pennsylvania.  Dave.  Hi.  Big fan, guys.  Here you are.  Local college here was in the newspaper a year or two ago.  They developed these special glasses.  Penn State.  They developed these glasses with a light in them, and they claimed that when you were in 
[00:27:00]  REM sleep, if you were dreaming you were in a field, the sky would blink.  Like, it would be that light.  And they said with training, you could participate in your dreams.  Yeah.  Could be all bullshit, but...  No, I think you can, because there are certain times you realize you're dreaming, and then  you can do things.  No.  But you're right at the brink of waking up, which is the bad part.  And I think that's the only reason you can control them, is because you're so close to  waking up.  Because every time I do get into a point where I'm controlling a dream, or I know I'm dreaming, 
[00:27:30]  so I start doing other things, like flying around or something like that, then I wake  up.  You just gotta stay cool?  Stay cool.  I always blow it.  I'm like, whoa, I'm dreaming, and this girl's naked over here!  The next thing you know, it's like butterflies in a fucking field somewhere.  Oh, it's terrible.  I panic.  So what do you do?  You just stay cool?  You're like, okay, I'm dreaming.  Oh, I'm dreaming.  I'm dreaming.  That girl over there is naked.  Now what do I do?  What do I do?  I'll stop walking over there, and ah, she turns into a dog. 
[00:28:00]  Yeah, good.  Now you fucked up.  You gotta stay cool, right?  Yeah.  Stay tiptoe over to her?  I think so.  You edge your way over real slowly.  Hello?  Hello, baby.  I don't know.  Let's move on, because these phone calls are all some shit.  Right back.  Oh, no, I didn't mean you.  I thought we were gone.  Sorry, Dave.  They're all shit.  I don't hold the little fuckers for a while.  He's right there. 
[00:28:30]  Do-do-do-do-do.  I got a good out-of-body experience story.  It's better than these retards on the phone.  All right.  We gotta take this one.  Another Dan the Man.  Dan.  Yeah, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Yeah, I took, back in the 90s, I took, like, two big fat tabs of XFD and a huge line of K,  and I was floating out-of-body for about five minutes until I came back down, and I was  sitting on a couch, and I fucking, I don't know, it was the craziest thing ever. 
[00:29:00]  I don't know.  Out-of-body experiences are definitely a real thing.  You know, you prefaced your call with, I got a good out-of-body experience story.  It's better than these retards on the phone.  Yeah.  And your story is to the point of, I don't know.  I got a little nervous.  I got a little nervous.  Oh, you got a little nervous.  Fair enough.  I'm still fucked up from last night.  You got a lot of nervous.  Yeah, all right.  Fair enough.  That was nothing.  But that's drug-induced.  Fair enough.  All sorts of things could happen when you're on drugs, right?  Yeah, that's not just a twain, you silly. 
[00:29:30]  Right.  All right.  Dummies.  Can we see the Wheel of Fortune guy?  Yeah, that guy.  Talk about a nightmare.  No kidding.  You like that tie in there?  I liked it.  No.  This guy is an idiot.  He's giving you another opportunity.  Let's spin, Pat.  All right.  Wow.  He hits the million.  L.  Yeah.  Four L's.  Pick that up. 
[00:30:00]  Turn it over.  Lay it down right over there.  He has a million dollar thing.  Yeah.  Wow.  Okay.  And he's got all the letters.  So he's got all the letters.  It's right there.  All he's got to do is read it.  Yeah.  He's just got to solve.  It's mythological hero Achilles.  Right.  Yeah.  There's no letters covered.  That's a good idea.  Yeah.  Mythological hero Achilles.  How much would he have won? 
[00:30:30]  I don't know.  He doesn't get the million dollars.  But he gets the shot at a million.  At a million.  At a million.  Right.  Achilles.  Why can't he go back?  What a stupid man.  You're a stupid, stupid man.  Until he's ill.  His face, when the woman next to him solves it and he's just standing there, his face is  right.  He is so lost.  Oh, I love it.  It's solved. 
[00:31:00]  That would be a good idea, yeah.  Mythological hero Achilles.  I can't accept that.  Okay.  I'll check.  I'll solve.  Yeah.  Mythological hero Achilles.  Yeah, that's it.  Oh, boy.  Well.  His face.  Well, when it comes to names.  He's just lost.  Even though the letters are up there.  Just ignoring him, too.  It's great.  This is what you did.  You have to say it.  And she won $1,000.  She had no money. 
[00:31:30]  She had nothing.  Because she didn't get to spin it all because he kept spinning and picking all the letters.  What a dope.  Do you think they're going to make fun of him back at Indiana?  Oh, yeah.  That wasn't the only...  No, that wasn't his only faux pas.  Oh, no.  There's another.  Oh, yeah.  And you said it.  You get $1,000, which is a house minimum.  So you have $1,000.  But we'll just...  They gave her the house minimum.  The house minimum.  Because she hadn't spun at all.  No.  She's like, I guess I'll solve and just read the big word.  Yeah, he took up the whole game and then just... 
[00:32:00]  Oh.  Achilles.  Achilles.  What a dummy.  What a dummy.  There's a W. Pick up that half car.  He's getting all the fucking good spins, too.  He got half a car.  And then he spins and gets the other half.  There's an L. Pick it up.  Solve it and get a car.  Wow.  Solve it and get a car.  Same guy.  And he's going to make up for where he flubbed.  And it's going to be a happy ending.  And look at the smile on his face. 
[00:32:30]  She's got it this time.  Wait, hold on.  Pause real quick.  I want to see what the letters are that's left.  I can't see what's left.  It'll show you.  Oh, okay.  Okay.  Because it's still gone.  C.  Can I solve?  Yeah.  The world's fastest blank A blank.  And he said C?  He said C.  Yeah.  But the clue is person.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  So it's definitely not...  Maybe he thought it was the world's fastest cad.  So it says the world's fastest. 
[00:33:00]  And we're looking for a person.  Blank A blank.  It's man without the M and the N.  Yeah, of course.  He thought it was car.  With the clue is person.  The world's fastest cow.  Maybe it was a Rifkin reference, he thought.  Yeah, maybe.  And so then it's going to go back to the girl again.  And it couldn't be car because there's already an R on the board.  Right.  In worlds.  So he really fucked this up.  He stinks at this.  He's terrible.  The world's fastest man.  Yeah, that's it.  And again, the same face. 
[00:33:30]  How funny would it be if he just right-hooked her?  Yeah, just punches her in the face.  And she had nothing on the board again.  She just gets her minimum thousand dollars.  Unfortunately, he screwed up again.  Again.  In the game, yeah.  He screwed up a third time.  And this is all one show.  Right.  Let's solve.  Okay, Jim.  He's going to solve this.  He's going to solve this.  Hold on.  In the on-the-spot decision.  Oh, very good.  On the spot dice spin. 
[00:34:00]  Dice spin?  Is he doing this on purpose?  I'm spinning around and around.  He's the dumbest man alive.  Dice spin.  What's so great is he might be the greatest wheel spinner that the show's ever had.  Right.  But the dumbest man.  Dice spin.  You don't even spin dice.  You roll dice.  On the spot?  On the spot. 
[00:34:30]  On the spot dice spin.  Oh, no.  God.  On the spot dice spin.  So the blonde looks at him.  You see how the blonde girl looked at him?  Her head whips around.  She goes, like, you've got to be shitting me.  Not again.  And then the brunette's like, how come I have to be on this side of the retard?  Yes.  Oh, my.  And his excitement is the best.  Oh, he's so psyched to get the winning answer.  He's like, finally.  All right.  I missed out on the million dollars.  I missed out on the car.  But I'm going to get my $7,500 for this on the spot dice spin. 
[00:35:00]  Oh, God.  Play it out.  Shelby?  On the spot decision.  Yeah, that's it.  He looks again.  He did it again.  Is he doing that on purpose?  Why would he?  I don't know.  To be in a viral video.  Why would he give up a million dollars in a car and then $7,500?  A chance at a car.  I mean, a chance at a million dollars.  He would have definitely got the car, right?  Yeah, because he got the two halves of the car.  He definitely had the car. 
[00:35:30]  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  And it's not like he's making any money off the viral video.  It's just people who watch it on TV.  Right.  That's true.  Oh, he just looks like a moron.  He does look stupid.  He really does look stupid.  Hey, I didn't have time to prep for this dice spin.  Dice spin.  Let's do it on the spot.  On the spot.  And we got an angry guy on the line.  What?  Go ahead, angry guy.  You dumb, fucking, uneducated cunts.  Look up this shit before you just play it on YouTube.  Do some show prep.  Uh-huh.  He's an Ethiopian man. 
[00:36:00]  English is his second language.  He's not the best at figuring out all the letters and all the words.  Ha, ha, ha.  Then don't play the fucking games.  He got into the University of Indiana.  Right.  He's a wheel of fortune.  He's at a fine university.  University of Indiana.  You can be born somewhere else.  Sam, you're born in fucking England, you dumb fuck.  Maybe he's fucking, maybe he's hungry then.  Yeah.  Maybe he's just hungry and he couldn't pronounce it.  Being Ethiopian and all.  I just think it's hilarious.  That's fair.  No, that's fair.  I take it back.  Thank you guys.  All right.  He's a dope. 
[00:36:30]  The guy's a dope.  He's a moron.  Uh, he's an idiot.  Wait, this guy also had a trip to London and blew that?  Why isn't that part of the video?  I don't know.  Oh, let me go to Greg.  Greg.  Hello, Greg.  How are you?  I'm doing good.  Yeah, no.  Right before he landed on the million, uh, he landed on a trip to London.  He blew a trip to London.  I guess he's not going on that.  And it did a million dollars.  What a fucking fool.  How did he blow the trip to London?  Oh, maybe it was, maybe he had in the first spin, maybe he had the million dollars and  the trip to London.  Oh, and the trip to London. 
[00:37:00]  Both on the board.  Oh, right.  Okay, I gotcha.  Yeah, on each list, yeah.  And then the chick just got a thousand bucks for it.  Look at her look of surprise and shock that the man is this dumb.  Right.  His stupidity astounds her, as it should.  There's never been such fortunate placement for a game show contestant as that chick next  to that guy.  Right.  Let's go to Dave in Iowa.  Dave.  Hey, Dave.  That's a great video, by the way.  Yeah.  Doing very well.  We'll put it on our Facebook page in case you haven't seen it.  Uh, go ahead, Dave. 
[00:37:30]  Yeah, you've been talking about all this dream stuff.  My four-year-old keeps telling me he sees my dad at night.  He died a few years ago, but he was like only three months old when he only met him for  the first time.  Is he Haley Joel Osmond?  Yeah, no, we've done this break before.  I'm sure the parents are going to start calling now.  This gets really fucking creepy.  Remember we read that list a while back?  Think creepy things kids say?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then we had a whole bunch of calls from parents going, I'm telling you, man. 
[00:38:00]  Yeah.  This is what happened to us.  Right.  Right.  I'm waiting for that day in my house.  So far, we're good.  So far, we're good.  My two-year-old, we moved in a new house, and my two-year-old keeps, he's just now learned  how to wave.  And the other night, he was waving at somebody in the house, and I just chalked it up as being  two years old, but a little weird.  Yeah.  Yay.  We was waving at each other.  Bye.  You hear about the little kid came out of his bedroom, looked out the window, and said, 
[00:38:30]  where are all the chickens?  Very scary.  Very scary.  Very nice callback.  I wish that guy would call.  Yeah.  Yeah?  No.  Let's look at the Minnesota video as well.  This is our video segment.  That one's really good, too.  And I'm going to clear the lines, because I'm sure the parents will be calling with their  creepy shit now.  Apparently, when he lost a million dollars, the girl next to him laughed.  Of course she would laugh.  Yeah.  On Wheel of Fortune.  Yeah.  Terrific news for her.  Yeah. 
[00:39:00]  She gets a thousand bucks.  Yeah.  She gets a fat G.  Score.  All right.  What do we got going on in Minneapolis?  The party's over.  What's this clip about?  Basically, the hockey team for this college in Minnesota lost the NCAA championship.  Right.  And so they decided to get drunk and riot the way white people do.  Okay.  Which means just be generally uproarious.  Right.  And then when an Asian news anchor tries to do his report.  Oh, boy. 
[00:39:30]  Just completely harass him like no one's been harassed before.  Oh, no.  But why would he be annoyed at this?  Because they keep shoving him and stuff.  But he went into a tough assignment.  What do you expect from these people?  They say, what's your fucking problem, man?  I also like that the news anchors at the desk, like, he keeps saying, if you listen, he'll  keep saying, I got to send it back to you.  And they keep going back to him.  Oh, no.  I love it that he's out there.  Yes.  Have you seen this?  No.  Oh, it's great.  They're normal service revolvers that they use in crowd situations like this. 
[00:40:00]  Let's go back to Jonathan.  It looks like he's got something there that he wants to tell us about.  Jonathan, go ahead.  Tim, we're hearing shots right now.  I don't think they're going to.  It sounds like colored guns right now.  A lot of people moving down the street.  We saw another group of students running out.  And they keep reaching for his arms and stuff.  What was the guy saying?  Did he say fucking something?  Yeah, if you listen, they're just cursing the whole time.  This is great.  They just wander into the camera and stare into the lens. 
[00:40:30]  This should happen every day.  We're bringing back our assault on the media finally, right?  Just don't fucking touch anybody.  We've got to get the hawk doing a few more of those.  Absolutely.  Just show how it's so good.  Show people how it's done.  Yeah, just show them how it's done.  Woo, cronuts!  And then runs out of steam and he has tiny fists.  His little dumb arms like a midget and he walks off camera ashamed.  Meanwhile, there's an 11-minute live shot happening somewhere else.  He's texting through it.  What a clod.  Wrong place, wrong time. 
[00:41:00]  Absolutely.  Day late, dollar short.  All right, now listen to the people.  Jonathan, go ahead.  Tim, we're hearing shots right now.  I don't think they're guns.  I think it sounds like pellet guns right now.  A lot of people running down the street.  We saw another group of students run down this way.  We're not sure.  Get off me.  Tim, I've got to send it back to you live.  A lot of people here drunk right now running down the street.  We fucking won.  And that's the news reporter going, get off me.  We fucking won. 
[00:41:30]  Get off me.  We're not sure.  Get off me.  Tim, I've got to send it back to you live.  A lot of people here drunk right now running down the street.  This is a chaotic scene.  I've got to send it back to you soon.  Yeah, no worries, Jonathan.  We'll find out more.  We'll get back to you.  No worries.  No worries.  We're going to take you back up to Skyfox now.  As you see, two squad cars heading west down the fourth.  All of you went to the U.  Know that is a very...  They're going to go ahead and go back to John.  John's probably like, okay, I got it back.  Come back to me. 
[00:42:00]  And look at these kids already.  They're waiting.  All revved up.  To pounce.  You can tell that they're leaving him alone.  And then the minute he starts talking, they all just go over.  Popular place.  He's there live right now.  Jonathan, set the scene for us.  You've got officers walking past you.  Tim, look at the riot police right now.  They are moving on 13th Avenue trying to get students out of the streets.  Again, after the game, people, the students inside the bar seem to be leaving in an orderly fashion.  But then we started to see people running. 
[00:42:30]  You guys are flicking his tongue like he's licking.  The police out here in full force coming out in teams, building walls right now.  Tim, I've got to send it back to you.  You see they're all grabbed him by the shoulder and jumping up and down.  They're jumping up and down with their hands on the guy's shoulders.  Just being annoying.  He's there fucking all cranky.  He is so annoyed right now.  The one guy's mimicking eating pussy.  Yeah.  Look at his tongue.  And then not only are they behind him, but they're jumping in front of him.  Yeah, yeah.  This is the worst thing that's happened to this man. 
[00:43:00]  That's great.  Every time we turn the camera on, we've just got a lot of idiots getting in our way.  So if we have anything new, we'll get it back to you.  What did he say?  Something about pussy.  It was something about pussy.  And you miss it as the clip goes on.  That one guy is still just pretending to eat pussy.  He's doing the tongue between his fingers pussy lick.  And the reporters just spend the whole time pushing.  He's getting out of his way.  He's in a fucking riot.  Did you hear him call them idiots?  Yeah. 
[00:43:30]  Every time these idiots keep shooting.  Idiots.  Yeah.  And then someone said pussy.  I want to hear them.  Every time we turn the camera on, we've just got a lot of idiots getting in our way.  So if we have anything new, we'll get it back to you.  Fuck her right in the pussy.  He says fuck her right in the pussy.  Wait, one more time so I can hear that.  No way.  Holy shit, yes.  Idiots getting in our way.  So if we have anything new, we'll get it back to you.  No doubt about it.  Fuck her right in the pussy.  Absolutely. 
[00:44:00]  He felt compelled to get the fuck her right in her pussy.  Helpful advice.  Oh, that's great.  Wow.  Oh, that's hilarious.  Oh, my God.  You're a bunch of drunks.  I love it.  Those are two great videos today.  And now someone's saying the Wheel of Fortune guy ended up winning in the end.  He won something.  He's a fucking idiot.  I saw the video clip.  He is an idiot, but he didn't win.  He's a fucking idiot.  He lost two trips.  The guy in Wheel of Fortune actually lost two trips.  He was the greatest spinner.  Why is it getting worse and worse? 
[00:44:30]  Steve, Chicago.  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Hey.  He actually, that was the second trip he lost because that was a prize puzzle where the  world's fastest man was actually from is where he was going to on the prize puzzle.  So that would have been the second trip of that round alone that he lost.  Ah, okay.  He fucked up.  Yeah.  Suffice to say.  Yeah.  It was horrible.  Thank you, sir.  Even if he was from wherever the other guy's at, he had still no excuse when he's going  to like this.  Of course. 
[00:45:00]  Ethiopia.  Oh, look at this.  He's just a fucking idiot.  Evolution.  Oh, wow.  Bob Saget.  It says, Evolution of Bob Saget, Family Man to Filthy Comedian.  What do you call yourselves?  The aristocrats.  After a family has done something you don't want to do.  Now, Bob, you've been known for years.  But it's not right.  Family Man to Filthy Comedian.  He was Filthy Comedian that went into that family man thing in the sitcoms.  They're making him do the aristocrats joke again. 
[00:45:30]  Together, let's let them do this in theaters.  I didn't know it was going to be in theaters.  I had a daughter going.  My oldest daughter, who is in this book, and she's been in my book signings, and she's  beautiful.  And she said, I'm going into the theater now, Dad, to watch the aristocrats.  I remember it.  It was a nightmare.  I said, no, don't, don't go.  Love you.  It's full.  Bye.  So it was an interesting time where people went, you know, he's got a foul mouth.  But I've been doing stand-up since I was 17, trying to get a job. 
[00:46:00]  And I was always probably not as blue as I was after that defining moment.  I was also an entourage at the same time.  So there's these two.  Oh, people see?  They don't know.  Got to get the word out that he's not the guy from that TV show there.  He's a dirty guy.  People now know that.  I know.  Mainstream media, I guess they don't.  Let's say hi to Dave in Minnesota.  He wants to add a little more to that video we just played here of the TV reporter getting 
[00:46:30]  just harassed.  Dave.  Yeah.  Hey.  Yeah, you got to look like halfway through the video, you'll see one guy walking past  the reporter, fucking with him.  And then there's a line of cops that just come out of nowhere and he spots them and he's  like a deer in a headbite and he just bolts it the other direction.  Oh, really?  We did see when the cops showed up.  Yeah.  They weren't really fucking with him as much.  Oh, it's great.  I love those.  I love all of those.  Yeah, fucking videos are great when the reporters lose it. 
[00:47:00]  But that riot was just a bunch of drunk kids, but the news made it seem like it was some  crazy, dangerous, life-threatening situation.  Mike in Minneapolis.  Yeah.  Seemed like it was all right.  In a lot of those cities, the cops have like all the riot gear and all the fun stuff,  but they never get to use it.  Yeah, they want to break it in a little bit.  So if there's like a gathering of people committing shenanigans, you got to put on the helmet and  get the fucking clubs out in the shields and start racking a few heads.  Breaking in your new glove.  Right, right. 
[00:47:30]  Breaking in the new glove.  For spring.  And it gives you a few fun stories to tell in the locker room, things like that.  Let's go to Sandra in Cincinnati.  Hi.  Whose birthday is it today?  What?  Oh, boy.  Cincinnati.  Big star.  Coming out of Cincinnati.  March shot.  March shot's birthday.  Nope.  I don't give a shit about baseball.  Pete Rose, 73.  Pete Rose, come on.  Pete Rose is 73 today. 
[00:48:00]  What do you got there, Sandra?  Well, when my grandma died about a year ago, about a week after she died, my daughter was  playing on my phone.  And she said that she was talking to grandma and that she said that she loved her and wasn't  sick anymore because she had cancer.  And I just was like, whatever.  It's probably just she's repeating what we told her.  Well, about a week later, we had dinner with my other family and my niece, who's about the  same age as my daughter. 
[00:48:30]  She was like, yeah, I talked to grandma on the phone the other day and she said that she  wasn't sick anymore and that she loved us.  And I was just like, holy shit.  Well, grandma got a new repertoire.  Exactly.  Telling the kids all the same shit.  Grandma's a bore.  Right.  We've done them bore.  That's the Twilight Zone.  I remember that one.  That was the one with the kid, Billy Moomy, there from Lost in Space.  His grandmother died and he kept getting phone calls from her. 
[00:49:00]  And the grandmother was trying to get him to kill himself.  What?  So he would be with the grandmother.  Sure.  And the father and mother are like, what the fuck?  Knock it off.  So then the kid, he does it.  He jumps into the fountain out back and drowns himself.  And he's laying on the ground and they're like, oh, we can't get, you know, the EMT guys  are like, oh, we can't get him back to life.  And then the father gets on the phone, the little toy phone.  And so it's going, mom, please, please don't take our boy.  He has such a long life.  And then you hear, and the kid comes back to life because the father was like pleading with 
[00:49:30]  his mother to not fucking take the kid.  That show was brilliant.  That show is great.  It holds up, too.  It absolutely does.  You can still watch those and it's just as chilling or fucking captivating to watch.  I love it.  Thank you, Sandra.  Thank you.  Have a good one.  We got a therapist.  He's going to explain why children can speak to dead relatives.  His name is Gorilla Bob and he's calling from the Jersey Turnpike. 
[00:50:00]  Gorilla Bob.  Yeah, hello, boys.  I'm a therapist.  I can, I know why children can see or babies really can see all of those dead relatives.  Go ahead.  Yes.  Eagerly awaiting.  Yes.  I'm not explaining it to you.  Oh, what?  Why would you?  That's Obie's new bit.  I'm the new bit guy.  Remember what Beck said?  Goodbye, boys.  What the fuck? 
[00:50:30]  That was like a bad edit of six phone calls.  Yes.  But I don't understand.  I don't either.  New bit guy.  He's not going to tell us.  Is he the guy that calls up and says, I know this, but then doesn't tell us?  Is that his character?  I think I said that one time.  Yeah.  Oh, maybe.  Maybe he ran with it.  I guess.  All right.  Jim on Long Island.  Jim.  Right here.  What's up, boys?  Hey, buddy.  Hello.  Hey, Ben.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:51:00]  We're here waiting.  Yeah.  Listen, so the other day, my two-year-old nephew, he's in the crib and all of a sudden I hear  him going, Tattletail, Caster Earl.  Way to go, Uncle Paul.  Yeah, I called him on the phone.  Oh, I make ghost noises.  I saw on Twitter over the weekend that the Long Island medium was trending.  Really?  So I kind of clicked on the trend to see what that was all about. 
[00:51:30]  And it was all these, mostly women, I got to be honest with you, were completely losing  their shit over watching the Long Island medium.  Why?  What was she doing?  Talking to dead people?  Which has been disproven by everybody.  But they love suing people that say just that, for whatever reason.  Well, that say what?  Who told us to be careful with that, Ben?  Oh, Ben, you just can't call them liars.  You can't say liar or fraud.  But you could say, you know, I don't believe that bullshit. 
[00:52:00]  Yeah.  But who's still buying into that?  And you could say, I'll...  I'm sure a few of my family members, I should shut up.  People who are very hopeful.  I've never seen people that have definitively proven that they talk to dead people.  And I've seen a lot of people who have definitively disproven.  It's disproven.  Like, Penn is brilliant when it comes to that shit.  Right.  And how they do it.  It's amazing.  But, I mean, like, just how she gets vague information and people are still holding out hope. 
[00:52:30]  It's like, why does she have vague signals coming from the beyond?  You know what the greatest thing for these people has been?  The fucking internet.  If you have an appointment, if someone calls you with an appointment to fucking have a reading done about your dead relative,  and you just Google their name, or go deeper, fuck Google, it's a business expense at that point.  You go into their records, find up their files.  Ancestry.com.  Ancestry with their death records.  Yeah, exactly.  Ancestry.  You know, shit like that. 
[00:53:00]  You could get so much information.  Anyone could seem like an amazing psychic.  Yeah, you would absolutely blow someone's mind.  Yep.  But to still believe, and when she's like, I'm thinking of the way he's kind of, I think he's trying to say, it starts with an S.  Yep.  And everyone just stares so she knows, okay, it's not an S.  It's not an S.  Well, no, no, not an S.  Wait, wait, it's an S in the name.  A P.  And then she sees someone, like, jump up a little bit.  Ah, yeah.  And people still buy into that shit. 
[00:53:30]  John Edwards shit on his TV show.  He used to make people fill out stuff.  Right.  Like, they didn't show that part.  Go to Twitter and put in Long Island Medium as, I think that was the hashtag.  You gotta read some of these tweets.  Yeah.  People are, they lose their minds over it.  Yeah.  They're dopes.  They deserve what they get.  They deserve what they get.  They're dopes, right?  They're fucking dopes and they deserve what they get.  There was only one good medium.  Her name was, uh, Raya.  Yes.  And I remember telling her once, well done, medium Raya. 
[00:54:00]  We heard you.  I think she spelled out Long Island, by the way.  We heard you.  Loud and clear.  Uh, yeah.  That's really bad.  It's your face, though.  You're hurting today.  You're hurting.  I like to pick up a nice raw steak with both hands and slap your face as hard as I can.  Smack me across my sunburned face. 
[00:54:30]  With a nice raw steak.  Oh.  Yeah, if you're tuning in, it's face is, like, beet red.  It's supposed to.  It's calmed down a little bit the last couple hours.  It's supposed to be, like, 74 today and sunny, so I'm gonna be out by the pool again.  Nice.  But I'm gonna put a little lotion on this time.  Or something that resembles it.  Yeah, it's something that resembles it.  So your tussles don't get burned.  Lotion.  Did you see my picture that I tweeted of Mr. Brady?  No.  From one of the episodes?  No.  When did you tweet it?  Apparently, uh, yesterday.  Oh, I saw.  Apparently, Mr. Brady, in one episode, was wearing an apron. 
[00:55:00]  Right.  And he was cooking something, and then Jan was doing her spastic, uh, tap dancing.  Right.  And she knocked into what he was cooking, which was some batter stuff, and it hit the floor  and sprayed up on him.  So he's standing there in an apron, looking down with this white, creamy stuff all over  his shirt.  And your tweet was just nice.  I just put, I put it, and I said, uh, foreshadowing or something.  Foreshadowing, for a question mark.  Because he had cum on him.  Sam, read some of these. 
[00:55:30]  Start with that Plain Jane one, I see.  Uh...  In the red.  Down here?  Right there.  Start with that one.  If I could meet anyone, it would be Teresa Caputo.  I freaking love her.  She is amazing.  Hashtag Long Island Medium.  I honestly think she changes lives.  Uh, this person is dumb.  I mean, in all fairness, she might change people's lives, but it's all, in my opinion, complete  bullshit.  Right.  She's not talking to any dead people.  Oh.  This person says, I get some people think hashtag Long Island Medium is fake. 
[00:56:00]  Regardless, the thing she does for people is amazing.  They need what she gives them.  Uh-huh.  Uh, this person says, hashtag Long Island Medium.  I love you, Teresa.  I'm your number one fan.  I wish you could tell my grandma...  Oh, hobble her.  ...I wish you could tell my grandma that I love her and miss her so much.  Thanks.  God bless you.  Well, you just did.  She's got Twitter.  If it's heaven, it's gotta have everything, right?  Of course.  So grandma's got Twitter.  Don't worry about it.  This episode of hashtag Long Island Medium is hitting too close to home. 
[00:56:30]  First time I ever cried this way watching something on TV.  Oh, God.  That's what I'm saying.  That's what I'm saying.  Because they're believing what she's putting forward.  How does she sleep at night, you think?  They're just dope.  People are dope.  She probably just says, well, you know, I know it's entertainment.  Or maybe she says, I'm helping people.  Yeah, she probably spins in her head like, well, I know that I don't actually have these powers.  But in the end, I think I'm helping them get over this. 
[00:57:00]  It amazes me that people don't know that these powers don't exist.  It's amazing to me that there are people that believe shit like this.  People are stupid.  You can tell when you watch videos that people post.  Check this out.  It's amazing.  And you look and go, no.  A plane can't land with one wing.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Uh-oh.  Let's go, R.C.  R.C. in Indiana. 
[00:57:30]  The home of that Wheel of Fortune dope.  Yeah, that Wheel of Fortune dope.  It's fucked up.  I went to IU for a little bit.  You know, Tom Crane's embarrassing our basketball team bad enough.  He's talking through a tire tube or something.  Yeah, what are you talking through?  I'm talking through a cellular phone.  Sounds bad.  No, it really sounds bad, for real.  It's a cellular phone.  Well, I'm actually traveling to North Carolina right now.  All right, drive safe.  Be good. 
[00:58:00]  God bless.  He says, but you were at a John Edwards reading, and it was pretty fucked up.  What made it so fucked up?  The fact that he knew that I called my grandma Nana.  Which, you know, I heard you guys say earlier.  He knew you called your grandma Nana.  Really?  What a great cold read, that is.  Nana, Grammy, Nonna, I'm getting something.  Right. 
[00:58:30]  Mima, Mimu, Mama, Papi, Poo Poo.  Yeah, and the funny thing was, I didn't even have a dead grandmother.  Ah.  Ah, okay.  You're fucking around.  Good for you.  Yeah.  In my humble opinion, he's a complete and utter fraud.  Yeah.  Yes.  I just find it hard to believe that anybody can communicate.  I wish all that stuff was believable to me.  That'd be great.  I wish I could believe it.  It'd be amazing.  It's such a nice, reassuring thing.  That would absolutely prove that there's life after death. 
[00:59:00]  That would be an amazing thing for everybody.  Let's go to Tom from the float place.  Tom, where's your float place?  Long Island?  Yes, sir.  Long Island.  It's in Farmerville.  It opened up in November, man.  I'm supposed to go, right?  Yeah.  I'll send you some stuff in the mail.  I'll get it out to you guys.  I'll get it out.  I've always wanted to float.  I learned about floating from Brother Weez back in the day.  What is it?  One of those chambers that you lay in?  With all that salt and shit.  Sensory deprivation? 
[00:59:30]  All the salt makes it where it's impossible to go into the water.  Then you close that cover up, and it's nice and dark, and you kind of chill out.  Then Joe Rogan, obviously, loves to float as well.  I definitely want to try this.  Yeah, you should.  It's about 150 gallons of water, and there's 900 pounds of medical-grade Epsom salt.  You actually float on top.  You don't have to try.  You don't have to hold your breath.  You just sit there and float.  Is that wild?  Yeah, it is fucking wild, huh?  I'll try it out next time I'm out your way. 
[01:00:00]  I bet you're pretty salty when you get out, huh?  I would imagine so.  There's a shower right next door to the tank.  You step out.  Oh, yeah?  Glory hole in the side?  There is, actually.  Oh, nice.  Right.  You guys were talking before about Pendulet and what you can say and what you can't say about people,  and I remember exactly what he said because I use it day-to-day whenever I comment on people.  You're allowed to – you can say, like, oh, that guy's a fucking asshole or that guy's out of his fucking mind. 
[01:00:30]  You said the typical thing is if you curse when you're insulting them or when you're commenting on them, that's the biggest thing.  So when you talk about, like, the long-hour media, you can't say, oh, she has an – you can't say, oh, she's a fraud.  But you can't say she's a fucking lunatic or she's a fucking fraud.  But I could say, am I a humble opinion?  Yeah, you could say that.  I believe.  Yes, sir.  I learned that a long time ago.  Of course.  As long as you say, am I a humble opinion?  As I see it.  As I see it, right.  Yeah.  Thank you, buddy. 
[01:01:00]  All right.  Cheers, Luke.  All right, man.  Cheers.  Let's go to Bob in Texas.  Bob.  All right.  A couple years ago, you know, the –  Bob.  My girl sat there and went to –  over in Houston where he had it at.  Yeah.  And it was $175 a pop.  There was a couple thousand people there.  And when you're standing in line, they make you fill out a whole card that, you know, your name.  A whole card.  You're trying to contact the whole thing.  Yeah.  Right.  Then what happened? 
[01:01:30]  Yeah, when people –  He's gone.  When people be on to it, if you go to one of these places and they make you fill out cards?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You shouldn't have to fill out anything.  Wouldn't you be the guy there going, I ain't filling out nothing and I want him to pick me?  Yep.  Or just lie on the card.  But I bet you if you're defiant like that, they figure out a way to get you out of the taping or something, too.  Because they're desperate people that want to contact loved ones.  What's the matter, Jimmy? 
[01:02:00]  What happened?  You okay?  Are you okay?  Hello.  Are you okay?  What happened?  Are you okay?  Oh, no.  Are you okay?  Want to go to break?  Want to go to break?  Want to go to break?  Want to go to break?

[01:07:30]  Welcome back to the Opium Ethnic Show on SiriusXM.  Sorry about that.  Well, it's completely reasonable.  Jesus.  Yeah, I got a call.  That wasn't a radio tease.  I got a call from Jim Florentine.  I knew it was bad news because he wouldn't call me on the air.  Yeah, you ran out of here.  I knew something was up.  And Otto died, and I just couldn't say it when I came back.  Yeah.  Obviously, it's always hard to say that, but I physically couldn't say it, so I wrote it down. 
[01:08:00]  But it wasn't to be mysterious.  No.  It wasn't some stupid tease.  I don't know what he died of.  I don't know.  Apparently, he had taken a nap and just didn't wake up.  It was 53.  That's pretty bad.  It's terrible.  Fuck.  We've known him a long time.  You've known him forever.  Fucking new comics.  Jesus Christ.  Yeah.  Fucking believable. 
[01:08:30]  I don't know if it was tied into what had happened where he was in the hospital for a while.  Yeah, he was in the hospital last year, was it?  For a while?  Almost a year ago.  It was a meningitis or something.  Meningitis of some sort, yeah.  Yeah.  Hmm.  So, I guess his girlfriend was calling people and, um, this was just the first I heard of it.  Fuck.  It's just heartbreaking.  Look.  No shit.  Wow.  Me.  That just out of nowhere. 
[01:09:00]  Yeah.  That shit just blindsides you.  He was a funny fucking guy, man.  Oh, man.  I mean, we always say that about people when they got off court, but Otto was a funny fucking guy.  Yeah, I don't think that.  No one made me laugh harder than him.  No one.  I don't think that.  As a guy.  So fucking funny.  So inappropriately funny.  I love it.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  That fucking, that break we did where he talked about the, uh, the fucking lady from Wizard of Oz dying. 
[01:09:30]  All right.  Get me some twisty ties and, I don't remember, and hay.  There was something he said.  It was such a brutal.  Yeah.  Right.  It was fucking brutal.  Oh, man.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Jeez.  It's like, what do you say?  You don't even know what to say.  It's just horrible.  It's just fucking a bummer, as they say.  It seemed like he was doing, you know, pretty good, too.  Yeah.  Got over that illness, which was extremely scary for him and, you know, everybody else. 
[01:10:00]  He was in the hospital a while.  Wasn't it, he was in Canada for what?  Was it for, uh, the comedy festival?  Oh, I don't even know what he was doing.  Yeah.  Then you fast forward, he came in here looking great.  Yeah.  Rusted and tan and feeling much better.  Yeah.  Gee.  We would just, I mean, you always say that when you're done.  We were texting him the other day, back and forth, doing, uh, Bob Levy and Clockwork Orange. 
[01:10:30]  That was the last thing we were talking about was Bobby.  It was fun, too.  Oh, shit.  I realized when I was texting him, too.  Like, I'm such a perv with my phone, and I'm such a piece of garbage, but I'm like, it's  so nice to be just texting a friend, or having some laughs, like not funny stuff.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like, it made, I had an odd revelation while I was doing that.  Like, it's so nice to be texting healthy and just having some fun together.  Right, not just looking for pussy or trolling.  It made me feel really normal and healthy.  Yelling at somebody or something. 
[01:11:00]  Yeah.  Just having some laughs.  Did some, uh, amazing stuff for this radio show.  Did our comedy festival, and...  Yeah, yeah.  I knew him way before then, though, when he was, uh, performing at Fast Daddy's in Huntington.  Oh, yeah, he was in Huntington all the time.  He would just, he would just, he would just slay.  He's been a fucking name to go see for, for years.  The whole town knew about him, because he would come up to Fast Daddy's and just kill it.  He was just amazing. 
[01:11:30]  Never really got his due.  No, he never did.  Nope.  No, he didn't.  Uh, Bob Levy.  Bobby.  Yeah.  I just got the call just now, and, uh, I'm just shocked, man.  I mean, we were friends for, like, 20-some years.  Yeah.  And, you know, he finally got his life together.  And for this to happen, you know, we were just fucking last week about stories from what we used to do when we were crazy. 
[01:12:00]  And we were like, I can't believe we're still alive.  And, you know, I don't know what happened, you know?  Right.  It's just like, I, it just blows me away that just one after another.  I mean, we're going down, you know, it's like fucking wrestlers have shit like a comedian.  What the fuck are you just telling jokes, you know?  And it's just like, this really hit me, man.  And we were going to hang out.  We, you know, in a week or two, we were going to Florida for a gig. 
[01:12:30]  And he goes, let's stay a few days and hang out and have a good time and get some sun.  And I was like, yeah, man, that sounds great.  And it's just, like, fucking unbelievable.  Because, you know, he is, he was a legend in his business and always will be known as that.  And that's got to be kept up.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  He may have been more underground than most people, but there, a lot of, most of the people that are underground are better than you see on TV. 
[01:13:00]  So.  Right.  When you pop up on other comics, favorite comic lists, you know?  Like, he was.  He was always, he was on a lot of people's lists.  When you talk to comics about who was fucking hilariously funny, fucking Otto.  Right.  You know?  Bob, how was he doing lately?  I mean, he was on our show, I don't know, not that long ago.  And he looked great.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like, he would call me up and he goes, it's right to have a couple beers, right?  You know? 
[01:13:30]  And I was like, you know, you don't need to drink.  I mean, but, you know, because I just wanted to sit in the yard, you know?  And, like, he was basically sober.  He was off the coke, you know?  I mean, and I just hope it's not, you know, people fall back.  You know, I haven't fall back, you know, fell back in, you know, almost four years now.  But, you know, it could shock your body and that shit.  But I just, I just, you know what I mean?  And I just hope it went peaceful because, I mean, like, working with him, like, it was 
[01:14:00]  the greatest thing because we used to go to Pips to work, right?  And that was a well-known comedy club.  A lot of big stars came out of there.  David Brenner, you know what I mean?  Dyson.  Dyson.  Many more.  And we played there one weekend and he looked at me and he goes, we made it.  You know what I mean?  Right.  Because in comedy, most fans think you make it when you've got it on TV or something like 
[01:14:30]  that.  When you're, most of this shit on TV, they couldn't follow me with their fucking dick  in their hands, okay?  So they ain't fucking nothing compared to us.  And it's just fucking, it's just so shocking when I got the call.  Like, out of, it's just like, you know, when you just talk to somebody and you're just  talking about the future and saying, you know, let's team up together.  We'll get Roger to get us some dirty shows, you know? 
[01:15:00]  Yeah, yeah.  And he seems so fucking happy, you know what I mean?  Because he loves working.  We always had fun working.  You know, I have such great, I'm writing a book now.  And we were going over stories that we did together when we were partying.  And when, like, we, after a show, we got a, like, a gram of Coke.  And he made me bring George home first before we did it because he couldn't sit in the trunk.  And that was, like, years ago. 
[01:15:30]  And, but he's clean.  You see what I mean?  When you fucking get your shit cleaned up, you can talk about it and laugh at shit.  Right.  And this is fucking shocking.  You know what I mean?  There's someone I've known since fucking I started this fucking thing and looked up to and was the nicest guy.  If anybody says a bad word about Otto, you don't fucking know him or you're a fucking asshole.  Mm-hmm.  Off stage.  That guy, he might have been the filthiest motherfucker. 
[01:16:00]  And I was just bragging to him about him to someone the other day.  I go, he is the filthiest motherfucker out there.  But he is hilarious.  And you can watch him over and over.  Yeah, yeah.  And it's just, it's really fucking shocking that fucking this shit is going on, man.  I don't understand it, man.  I mean, I'm, like, fucking lost right now.  Yeah.  Because I just got the phone call. 
[01:16:30]  Yeah, this shit's always fucked up.  Just don't know what to do or say.  Right.  Just walk around in a haze.  Yeah.  It's like you don't know what to say.  You don't know, like, what the fuck do you say to his girlfriend?  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  You know?  I mean, the way I look at it, you got to take care of her.  Do a show.  You know what I mean?  Fucking raise some money.  You know?  You got to do something in his name.  You know?  Yeah.  He was a fucking legend.  I don't give a fuck. 
[01:17:00]  You know what I mean?  All these douchebags can get on fucking TV or whatever the fuck with their shit material  because they got a pretty look or something like that.  But let me tell you something.  The real fucking legends are the ones that fucking go out there and bust their balls every  night and fucking kill in front of people.  Yeah.  And there should be something of fun made up for him where his name would carry on because,  I mean, he did mean a lot to a lot of fucking people. 
[01:17:30]  And, of course, you guys.  I mean, he fucking loves you guys.  You know?  He's always talked about you guys.  You know?  Right.  Because you guys are fucking real.  You know?  He was fucking hilarious on the show, too.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He came to you guys because you guys are fucking real.  He's a real fucking person.  He's not into the bullshit Hollywood.  I got it.  That's why he came to you.  You know?  I got to tell you, that George thing was creepy, though, at times.  I remember at NEW, he comes in in the early days when we didn't know him that well, and 
[01:18:00]  he's just killing it for us.  And then, like, in between breaks, he always loved reading the newspaper.  Otto loved getting knowledge.  Yeah.  He's reading the newspapers while we're in break, and I look over, and then I kind  of, like, get ants' attention.  I go, you got to look at this.  What is he doing?  And he's reading the newspaper, and George is reading along with Otto.  Like, he's moving George's head and stuff.  He's moving his eyes, like, back and forth.  And I never forgot that, because I'm thinking, oh, my God, he's not doing this for anyone. 
[01:18:30]  He doesn't even realize we're looking at him right now.  He's reading along.  And I'm like, what is that about?  Well, that's what it is.  It becomes, like, you know, it's part of you.  Right.  You know what I mean?  Like, to him.  And, like, when he was done with his set, like, no one can tell you, he would wrap his  doll up, his head up, like, you know, like an Iranian.  Or something like that.  So, it was comfortable.  It had, like, the headgear on it.  But it always had to go home before we went out after a show. 
[01:19:00]  Man.  And he always had, like, you know, Rodney loved him, okay?  And he always had, he goes, listen to this message.  We always, every time we went back, we'd listen to it.  And he's like, hey, kid, I'm telling you.  You know what I mean?  Let's go.  You got it.  You know?  You're the man.  You know?  You missed your laugh.  You know?  But, you know, I think he was somewhat a little bit afraid of success.  Yeah, yeah.  But the whole thing was, is that you never, you can never sit down with a guy and just, 
[01:19:30]  like, a sweetheart.  You know what I mean?  Right.  Like, you know, there's scumbags in this business.  You know what I mean?  But, you know, I mean, nobody could say that about him.  I mean, he was a true fucking person.  And, you know, it's just, you wake up and you're just fucking, you know, I'm listening  to you guys.  I finally got my schedule set up and fucking, I got a call and I'm like, this has got to 
[01:20:00]  be a fucking joke because we were just talking last week.  We were supposed to go to Florida next Friday or Saturday.  Right, yeah.  And I'm like, fuck, we were going to hang out in that shit.  And fucking, I'm just like, I don't, you know what I mean?  It makes you think about everything, you know?  It's just fucking heartbreaking.  You never know.  It's a guy who never got his due in the business.  Mm-hmm.  And, you know, he's just another funny guy who the business just did not give what he 
[01:20:30]  deserved to.  Right.  He was another funny guy with all these fucking mediocre motherfuckers because the critics  like him and because they carry the right narrative or ideology and a brilliantly funny guy like  him.  And Otto was punch you in the stomach funny.  Nobody made people laugh.  When he killed, it was absolutely unfollowable. 
[01:21:00]  And he's one of those guys that all the comedians would walk in to watch.  And I remember somebody at a roast, it was years ago, this is probably 1992 or 93, was  talking about somebody.  And they said, they mentioned, what did he say about Otto?  He said something about, you'll notice that the comedians in the room, he was a roast that the public was at.  And he said, you'll know who the comedians in the room are because they're the ones in the room who are not laughing until Otto is on. 
[01:21:30]  And then they're going to be the only ones who are.  I always remember that is such a great description of mixing Otto with comics and the public.  Right.  And he was just, that's what he always said.  He always said, how come these pieces of shit are on TV and we can't get a fucking special?  You know what I mean?  He goes, he goes, it's because, you know what I mean?  Like these MTV guys got 15 fucking minutes.  They're fucking selling out. 
[01:22:00]  Are you fucking kidding me?  Comedy is a fucking, like, you know, like me, Jimmy, you know, Otto, Florentine, you know, everybody that you know that's fucking anybody that's fucking powerful and knows comedy.  It's just such a shitty fucking business because they put out shit on TV, yet, you know what I mean?  So people don't go as the clubs.  They're like, this is what's in clubs.  No, that's not what's in clubs.  We're in fucking clubs. 
[01:22:30]  Right.  Come and see fucking real comedy, man.  You're not some fucking 18-year-old fucking girl that has 15 fucking minutes.  It's just one of those things.  Thank you, brother.  I'll talk to you soon.  I'll see you.  I'm sure I'll see you before the thing.  Yeah, Bob.  Thanks, man.  Help out the family, wait.  Yeah.  All right, Bobby.  You're good, brother.  Bob Levy, who was very close with Otto George.  Jimmy just told us that Otto died in his sleep.  Yeah, I got the call from Jim.  During the thing. 
[01:23:00]  Right.  I just, it's really weird to not be able to say that.  You know, I just couldn't say it.  Right.  It was, you know, whatever.  We all act weird when we hear that.  And then you take a couple minutes.  But it's just terrible.  Do you remember the first time you met him or saw him?  Yep.  It was in the Varsity Pub.  And it was before I did comedy.  I was just starting.  And me and my buddy would go to watch shows.  It's where I first saw Florentine.  And guys like Quentin Higgs and that guy, Jeff Zebrowski, who I did get an update on, 
[01:23:30]  by the way.  He retired and won some kind of lotteries.  Oh, really?  Yeah, he's doing good.  But Otto was one of the guys that Patrick Gaynor, who was the guy who really, I would  not be doing comedy if it wasn't for Patrick Gaynor, told me.  Who was Patrick Gaynor?  I don't even know.  He was a local booker.  Oh, okay.  And he died years ago.  And the Varsity Pub was the first place I ever went on.  So I would go and watch the shows on the weekends.  I would never heckle the comics.  Sometimes Patrick would let me, like, introduce the show just to get me on stage before I ever  performed.  And that's where I saw Otto for the first time. 
[01:24:00]  And I, it was like seeing Zeppelin for, you know.  Yeah.  Jesus.  Yeah, seeing him for the first time was a shock.  Right.  Like, and I think I saw him at the place in Huntington.  Fast Eddie's.  That was the first place I saw him.  They taped them.  And then that was one of those tapes, you got to remember, way before the internet.  I'm talking, like, my BAB days.  So, what, 92 to 95-ish.  Somewhere in there. 
[01:24:30]  And they taped him a couple times.  And that tape, man.  Yeah, yeah.  By the time you got a copy, you almost couldn't, you know, hear it anymore.  But that's, he was one of those guys where his stuff was just passed around and traded.  Yeah, if he was going to be around locally, everyone knew it.  Right.  And you had to go see him.  Right.  Because he was like the, you know, you were going to see shit you weren't going to see  anywhere else.  But you had to go pick him up.  Always.  All you guys have stories about that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You'd have to pick him up from, he lived off Jewel Avenue in Queens at one point. 
[01:25:00]  And I lived in North Brunswick.  And I remember I would pick him up to go to.  You'd have to go.  Yeah.  Wow.  Wow, that's a hell of a drive.  Right.  I remember, what's his name?  Oh, great white gorilla.  He used to have to pick him up all the time.  Yeah, yeah, Jeff.  Jeff Norris.  Jeff Norris.  I remember he stepped in dog shit and brought him my car.  And I wanted to fucking strangle him.  So I just got the car.  And Florentine was with me.  He's like, Otto, you tracked the whole log in the car.  He bought a fucking, it was like a log of horse shit.  It's like, you dope. 
[01:25:30]  It wasn't just a little.  No.  With a giant piece.  You brought the whole log.  Yeah, you brought the whole log in.  Is Florentine up for talking or not?  I don't want to force anyone to get on the show, but maybe get word out if he wants to call  on.  That'd be great.  I also remember at NEW, he was this funny that we tolerated some of this stuff.  Like, he would kill for a minute or two and then feel like it wasn't going well.  And then he would just leave.  And me and Anthony would sit, and certainly Jimmy, too, would solve this over the years. 
[01:26:00]  And all of a sudden, like, where'd he go?  Yeah, yeah.  He would just run out.  He got that under control years later.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You remember those days?  Yep.  I don't like it.  Yeah.  He thought he sucked.  He's gone.  I'm like, he was killing.  Yeah.  Oh, this just sucks.  No, it's just, like, enough of this.  I fucking hate it.  I mean, you just got to kind of, you know, get through it. 
[01:26:30]  What do you do?  There's no fucking, nothing you can do.  That's not what you do.  You just try to.  You just got to feel like shit now for, you know, everybody makes it about that.  How come Otto wasn't able to become more of a star?  That's a pretty good question.  I don't know.  He was one like fucking Patrice.  He wouldn't play the game.  He wouldn't, I think it's one part of his career, it was probably his demons.  Yeah.  And substance abuse that kept him from really achieving. 
[01:27:00]  But then, you know, he's not going to compromise and not say, Pope wrote cunt, sir.  He never had the proper management.  I don't think he ever had the proper people.  Rick Messina really loved him, who was Tim Allen's.  All those guys loved Otto.  Right.  And they really did.  And he was in Comedy's Dirtiest Dozen with Chris Rock and Bill Hicks and a bunch of those guys.  You know, and I think that they loved him, but it's like, what do you do with a dirty ventriloquist?  I'm guessing that's what the business, which is so uncreative and pathetic. 
[01:27:30]  And every time they come out with those fucking funniest people lists, I want to just fucking strangle the dummy who wrote it.  Because there's usually 10 people that really, or 15 people I think, really deserve to be on it.  And the other 35 that are just like, oh, you fucking...  Really?  Benicio Del Toro?  Is he a hoot?  It's just the weirdest, you know, and it's like a guy like Otto will never make a list like that.  Yeah.  Never.  And he was funnier than any of them.  Yeah.  He was funnier than any of them. 
[01:28:00]  Jeez.  Oh, jeez.  Yeah.  Boy, did I work with him having some fucking awful shows, too.  Well, when they didn't like him, it was ugly.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  There was no ambiguity.  They hated him.  Boy, it was full steam ahead.  Right, right.  But he had no problem with that.  No, he didn't like it, but I mean, he knew how to deal with it.  I mean, he couldn't change gears.  He was who he was.  Yeah.  You know, and so he would just kind of fucking plow ahead and make it worse for him. 
[01:28:30]  Oh, he could rip into people.  Oh, man.  Yeah.  Wow, he says some great stuff.  Yeah.  We got any Otto and George stuff we could play today?  Yeah.  What do we, would you guys find a few?  Well, we're looking through stuff right now, but we actually have the Wizards of Oz line.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  It's a little two-minute thing if you want to go to it at any point.  Yeah, why don't we do that now? 
[01:29:00]  We'll go to break with us, and then we'll continue.  Oh, yeah.  Now, she dressed immaculately in an elegant royal blue dressing gown, then with her hair  properly styled, she took an overdose of sleeping pills, she laid down on the couch,  covered herself with a gold blanket over her shoulders, and tied a plastic bag over her head.  It's like that she shoved hay in her twat and asshole. 
[01:29:30]  After all that beautifying, she shoved hay in her twat and asshole.  Oh, God damn.  Maybe grass, too.  Annie, yeah.  Read the note she left behind.  Read the note.  She left a note behind that said...  I love that, man.  I am now about to make the great adventure.  I cannot endure this agonizing pain any longer.  It is all over my body. 
[01:30:00]  Neither can I face the impending blindness.  I pray the Lord my soul to take.  Amen.  Wow.  And then her landlady found her.  Oh, that's great.  Hay is such an unpleasant thing to shove in your twat and asshole.  Like mulch would be okay because it's soft grass.  No, that's hard.  But hay would hurt your cunt and grass perforate things.  Was she sick or just not getting work?  Just not getting work.  No one wanted Annie at me in 1962. 
[01:30:30]  Nobody's hiding me.  I've got to shove hay in my mouth, cunt and asshole.  Give it a fucking dry-cleaning bag.  Well, room 206, more hay and a fucking...  Run down to the dry-cleaner.  Be a deer.  Run down to the dry-cleaner.  Give me some...  Give me some twist-sticks.  Oh, fuck.  Beer, beer, beer.  Room 206, more hay.

Try Mujan.  Here's you.  Ah!  I hope the bastard appreciates this.  Yanking my t*** hairs out by the root.  So I look good in a sundress.

It's not anymore, Otto.  There's aloe in there.  Thanks for asking ahead of time.  If you get hit by a truck that's carrying aloe, does it still hurt?

Pretty fucked up, because we all knew him very well.  Yeah.  And he was a true friend of the show, and incredibly funny.  One of the funniest.  Yeah.  And now we sit here.  Fun guy.  Just watching the clock. 
[01:39:30]  And it's like, oh...  This is a clock watcher now.  You just sit here and go, all right.  Could 10.30 be here now, so...  What do we do?  So we could just wander.  What do we do?  All I want to do is just wander.  Just wander?  Yeah.  Just want to wander.  I'm going to pay tribute out by my pool with a beer and some sun.  This has got to be tough for you, because you don't like this.  No one likes it, trust me.  I don't deal with things like this well at all.  At all.  We all have our individual ways of dealing with these situations. 
[01:40:00]  Right.  Mine is to trudge on like nothing happened.  Stomp it down as deep as you can.  And you've got to get the other side of you as red as the front side of you, so...  Yeah, yeah, I do have to get the back of myself a little burned today.  Let's say hi to Keith in Boston.  Keith.  Yo, Keith.  Hey, buddy.  Hey, I contacted Otto about a year ago on YouTube, and he goes,  Hey, I like hearing from fans. 
[01:40:30]  I want to send you some information.  Give me your address.  He sent me a boy in his log, which I already downloaded from YouTube.  I mean, iTunes.  And he also sent me American Dummy, which I thought, when I watched it, I was blown away.  I was like, this is fucking worthy of Rod Sterling.  I mean, Jimmy's reaction in that thought, when he spit out that water and laughed,  you could tell it was not acting.  It was actually a true testament of how funny Otto was, man.  I don't remember. 
[01:41:00]  I forgot I was in that movie.  Jim Brewer was in that.  Yeah.  Louis Black.  We shot that at the comic strip.  Pete Correale.  Nina Torrey made out with Nina Hartley at the end.  Oh, right.  It was hot.  Yeah.  Yeah, well.  He played a guy named Jerry, I think.  I think his name was Jerry in that.  Thank you, sir.  All right.  Take it easy.  Oh, American Dummy is a classic.  It's really, really funny.  Really fucking funny.  Yeah, I was happy for him that he got that show with the pig roast.  Right.  On his pig roast.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:41:30]  He was doing great with that.  Fucking, that segment he did where he would just read the newspaper outside with George.  Right.  Oh, God, was that fucking good.  His take, like, his material is fucking hilarious.  But his take on the news and stuff was great.  He had that unique, fucked-up viewpoint, just completely politically incorrect, which I loved.  Right.  Yeah. 
[01:42:00]  All right.  We got, um...  Oh, wow.  Hollywood Joe's checking in.  What?  Nice.  Joe DeRosa.  Hi, buddy.  Hey, guys.  How are you?  How are you?  How are you, guys?  Yeah, you know.  It takes for someone to die for you to call us, huh, Joe?  Oh, shit, Joe.  Come on.  Come on, man.  I poke as I love, brother.  You know.  I'm just fucking with you.  I woke up.  I'm usually not awake this early, but I couldn't sleep, and I looked on Twitter, and I saw Levy's tweets about Otto and George. 
[01:42:30]  I can't fucking believe it, man.  I'm, like, in shock right now.  Yeah.  What happened?  Uh, well, that's what we're all trying to figure out.  Like, uh, I think we, I think Jimmy said that he, he took a nap, and that was it.  Uh, well, I'm sure we'll get more info, um, later, but, uh, yeah, that fucking blows.  He was so goddamn funny.  Yeah, he, he, uh, the thing that always blew me away about him was, like, when the dummy would do, like, his inner monologue. 
[01:43:00]  Yeah.  And, like, like, I, like, I, I remember seeing him at Carol Orange, and, like, you know, he, he did a joke that didn't go over that, like, Otto said a joke that didn't go over that well.  And then the dummy looked at him and started going, what are you, nervous, you fucking pussy?  Yeah.  Yes.  It would be, it would be, it was the greatest inner monologue reaction ever, because he had the puppet, and it would be very funny, like, if a joke didn't work, um, and Otto would just stammer something, George would go, sweat, you Danish junkie. 
[01:43:30]  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha 
[01:44:00]  He did the Kennedy bit where the puppet gets shot and the brains come out, like the Kennedy assassination.  And during it, he's going, he's going, they're shooting, Norton.  Yeah, they're shooting.  Put the top up, Norton.  Yeah, put the top up, Norton.  They're shooting at us.  So funny.  Went to a honeymoon.  Oh, shit.  That's so good, man.  And then I remember Patrice was on the shows, too. 
[01:44:30]  It's so fucking sad, man.  Jesus Christ.  But Patrice was on the shows, too.  And we were down, the theater we were in, the green room was downstairs under the stage.  And there was this long cinder block hallway.  So if anybody was coming down the hallway from the stage, you could hear it.  It was just echo.  I remember Patrice was, Otto was on stage when I came walking down.  And Patrice's cackle was, like, cascading off the cinder block.  And he walks in the room and I go, what's so funny, man?  And he goes, I don't know.  Just don't give a fuck about even trying to make you look like batrilocity. 
[01:45:00]  He was talking.  I can so fucking see that.  Don't give a fuck.  Oh, shit, man.  Oh, that's great.  Hey, Joe DeRosa.  Yeah.  I forgot about this.  We were talking about dreams earlier.  I had a dream that Joe DeRosa was in.  Oh, really?  Yes.  And this was just, like, two nights ago. 
[01:45:30]  Yeah.  I was in this bedroom trying to have sex with this girl on a mattress on the floor.  And you were on a bed in the same room, but it was on, like, a frame, bed frame.  So it was a little higher up.  And I was trying to fuck real quiet so you wouldn't hear.  But I don't know why you were in the room, what was going on.  I don't know why I was, either.  The most unrealistic part of the dream was that I was wearing a condom. 
[01:46:00]  You're responsible in your dreams?  I know.  Why in a dream when I wear a condom?  What's wrong with you?  What an asshole.  I don't know.  But he dream rapes Joe.  But he's responsible enough to wear a condom.  And the condom was making a squeaky rubber noise that I thought was going to wake Joe up.  Right.  Fucking odd.  I think your dream was reinforcing that you shouldn't wear condoms.  Yes, that's the lesson.  That's the lesson I grabbed out of the dream.  Fuck the condoms. 
[01:46:30]  I love that I was in the dream.  I am, too.  You got up.  You walked out of the room.  I was like, hey, Joe.  Yeah.  Get away with it.  When are you planning on coming back to New York anytime soon for some beverages?  Yeah.  I think I'm going to be in New York all of July.  Oh, nice.  So I hope I get to see all of you guys and hang out.  I just cracked the pool open, my friend.  So we have a party coming up.  I love it.  Yeah, party. 
[01:47:00]  Yep.  It's great.  And we're hearing all the stories from everybody.  You're a mover and shaker out there now.  Oh, he's Hollywood Joe DeRosa.  You're Hollywood Joe.  So, you know, taking meetings and hanging out and hobnobbing.  A little hobnobbing going on.  I terribly miss the O&A show.  It's a less filthy place out here.  And I don't know how I feel about that.  It's probably a very artificial feeling. 
[01:47:30]  And how's the gig going with Pete Holmes?  Gig's going well.  Awesome.  I don't know.  L.A.'s weird.  It's been a nice experience, but I just feel like I'm supposed to live in New York.  That's the best way.  You know, I've heard a saying, it's a nice place to visit, but I wouldn't want to live there.  Hey, you know, Ant, if I had a time, I'll tell you.  Oh, God.  Yes, exactly.  Can I tell you guys my favorite auto story?  Yes.  Oh, you scared me.  I thought you were going to say, can I plug something? 
[01:48:00]  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, Jesus.  Well, we've heard that so many times.  Hey, can I?  Yeah, of course, Joe.  Go ahead.  Oh, my boss.  Listen, it's real sad.  Can I just say, my CD is out right now.  This is my favorite auto story.  He's at Caroline's, and he's on stage, obviously.  And there's a guy sitting to the left of the stage, and it's like this big Italian guy. 
[01:48:30]  The guy's got to weigh 400 pounds.  He's just huge.  But he's wearing this checkered sport coat.  And Otto's on stage, and he's doing a bit.  And the dummy, like, isn't paying attention.  And in the middle of the bit, the fucking dummy just looks over at the fat guy.  And he just goes, Jesus fucking Christ.  What size is that sport coat, you fucking zilch?  And it would seem like, oh, my God, why is the puppet saying that when Otto was in the middle of doing something? 
[01:49:00]  Like, for somebody who moved his lips when he talked, working that puppet, you were completely fooled into thinking it was a different entity.  Oh, absolutely.  You know, it was a different fucking person.  Absolutely.  He was Twittering out a lot of old photos recently, too.  Like, stuff from, like, the 70s.  Wow.  Really, like, when he was 15, 14 years old. 
[01:49:30]  If you see his old Twitter timeline, there's some really good pictures.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  I'm going to look at it.  If you guys find anything out, why don't you text me?  I'm going to keep looking.  Yeah, we'll let you know, Joe.  Oh, absolutely, man.  Yeah.  Cool.  Well, you guys always, you guys always, you know, showcased him and supported him, and that was awesome.  And it's a bummer that he's, it's a real fucking bummer.  Yeah.  I'm so fucking lootly. 
[01:50:00]  All right, man.  Hopefully, I'll see you in, see you in July at some point.  I'll see you guys in July, man.  I miss all of you.  I'll see you soon.  Sounds great, Joe.  Take it easy, man.  Take care, guys.  All right, buddy.  Later.  What a fucking asshole.  It's like doing that right when the phone clicks.  Wow, what an asshole.  Joe's great.  I miss that guy.  Yeah, a lot of people want to talk about Otto.  Ike in Washington.  Go ahead, buddy.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Hey. 
[01:50:30]  To tell you how long I've seen this guy, 1993, I was doing, it was my prom, and I see this guy.  I have no idea who he is.  And he was so funny, I almost knocked over the table.  The guy was just amazing.  But a couple years ago, I saw a YouTube thing on him where he was on Howard's show, and he was killing.  But he said something like, oh, I suck.  I suck.  So, I don't know, maybe Jimmy could elaborate on this, but was there any, you know, instability or something? 
[01:51:00]  I mean, I don't know.  Did you just ask if there was any instability with Otto?  Yes, there was.  I said maybe, like, five words to the guy when I used to see him down at either the Comedy Cellar, or I saw him in the Midwest one day.  But, you know, he was like my idol.  When I saw him, I was starstruck.  I swear to God, because he was the funniest guy.  You know, when you saw him on The Aristocrats, you know, it was only like a minute and 15 that he was on. 
[01:51:30]  But, you know, he says, I bring out my daughter.  She's a real sexy nine-year-old.  Like, killer, I fucked the ball and all.  I mean, you have no time to register how funny this guy is.  It's a sad day.  Does anyone know what happened?  No, we don't know yet.  We truly don't know, brother.  Jimmy literally just found out in the middle of our show.  He ran out of here to take a phone call, and we all knew that can't be good. 
[01:52:00]  Oh, boy.  Well, listen, I'm punching out.  I love you guys.  Love you, brother.  Thank you, sir.  All right, man.  Later, man.  There he goes, a caller.  Ike from Washington.  Godspeed.  Oh, he's still on.  Do we have more Otto and George clips, Sam?  Anything else?  Did we find anything else?  Still digging around?  Digging through everything right now.  Yeah. 
[01:52:30]  Yeah.  Hmm.  Hmm.  All right.  Let's go to John in Poughkeepsie.  John.  Hey, guys.  Hey, boy.  Hello.  All right, P.  It's going to be weird to see, like, I mean, George was such a personality that he's going  to be sitting in a box somewhere and maybe never taken out again.  You'd think, like, it's almost human kind of a person.  And he's, is he dead?  That is a weird thing. 
[01:53:00]  It's kind of, you know.  Will he just disappear?  Because he made him so mortal that it's like, wow, we're going to lose George, too.  Yeah, no one else can fucking use him.  It's fucking just kind of a weird thing.  George goes with Otto.  Yeah.  Period.  Okay.  That's a strange concept.  Do you think that would be...  If Otto had a will, I have no idea.  I would guarantee that's a will.  Yeah.  George goes with me.  You know, there's only one thing to say.  Get over it. 
[01:53:30]  Well.  Yeah, I know.  In time, perhaps.  But there's a time, you know, you guys make so much fun of so many, but it's weird when  it hits you.  You almost feel like you guys can't...  I mean, I know you're going to joke about it, but it's so...  I mean, I remember you guys talking about something.  You're panicking, sir.  I lost somebody.  You're panicking.  Why are you panicking?  Because the get over it thing didn't work that well?  Yeah, yeah.  Because now you're panicking on us.  That's exactly what it was.  I get it.  We would have done the same thing.  Yeah, we would have played get over it.  It's weird, man, but I wish them all the best.  All right. 
[01:54:00]  Peace.  Stop panicking, please.  Thank you.  Tony in Brooklyn.  Tony.  Did your testicles get hit by a storm window?  Moosh on.  That might be one of the funniest clips ever played, and I downloaded it when it was on  what do you call the free...  Yeah.  Man, I loved all your old clips, and man, he was a star at AEW, man. 
[01:54:30]  We've all gone back and forth, the greatest live read ever, and it was always between Autumn  and George, and Brewer's Razor Rollerboard Scooter one.  Yeah.  Between those two, I can't even think of a third that would be in that category.  Those were just amazing.  Was there a time when Pat from Winaki went down on a girl in our studio?  Maybe.  Because that's what I'm getting here.  It says, and Otto was there, and he said, it's like watching Tor Johnson bobbing for 
[01:55:00]  gonorrhea.  Oh, he definitely said that.  That was actually one of your lines of the day right there.  He definitely said that.  Tor Johnson bobbing for gonorrhea.  Holy fuck, is that funny.  Lisa Sparks?  Lisa Sparks.  Is that...  Right.  Okay.  All right.  Yes, right.  Thank you, you A-Rab.  Ah, let's go to Ernesto, it looks like.  Staten Island.  Hey, Oprah. 
[01:55:30]  Hey.  Sad day, man.  Sad day.  Yeah, eh?  Yeah.  I had heard about this guy who was a revenge reliquist with a filthy puppet.  A couple, and then about a year later, you guys had him on for Anthony's birthday, and  they did, and you guys did the Mouchon commercial.  Yeah.  I still, I have that on, I bootlegged it.  We just played it.  That it's still one of the funniest.  Oh, you did?  Yeah.  I turned it on the radio, guys.  Sorry.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:56:00]  Oh, okay.  I thought you were commenting about it, because we just played it.  Yeah.  We just played it for everybody.  Yeah, that was a classic from the second it was done, and I knew that one was like,  oh, my God.  Right.  What a fucking pisser.  Guys, I'm sure when you find out any information, you'll tweet it out.  Just sad day, man.  I'm going to go, I'm going to go shoot my ex-wife in the head and fuck the bullet hole  just for him.  Oh, nice.  All right.  That's wonderful.  Thank you, Ernesto. 
[01:56:30]  Ernesto.  I am Ernesto.  Oh, this fucking woman.  Oh.  That mug shot.  The woman accused of killing seven babies she birthed over ten years.  She's got a hell of a mug shot there.  It looks like, huh?  Huh?  Me?  It's just amazing.  Wait, she twisted motherfuckers out there.  Wait, it wasn't all at the same time?  No, no.  Obviously, if they're calling it seven babies?  Over ten years.  Over ten years?  I guess she didn't want to have, you know, those babies.  Right.  So she had them and then killed them. 
[01:57:00]  And no one knew until now?  I guess not.  She's a weird looking bitch.  She's got them crazy eyes.  How long would the baby survive before she decided they were evil or whatever the fuck?  I don't know.  Nah, nah.  Yeah, when do, when do, how crazy do you have to be?  Like, does that, does it come up how crazy you are for how long you wait before you realize  your baby's the devil or something and then have to get rid of it? 
[01:57:30]  Aw.  Ugh.  Yee.  Let's see.  Let's say hi to Corey in Yonkers.  Corey.  Yes, Corey.  Hey, guys.  How are you?  All right.  All right.  No, I just want to tell you, one of the first times I ever saw Otto was in 1990 or 91 in  Yonkers at a place called Shooting Stars.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, man.  And it was owned by Grandpa Al, I think, at the time.  Oh, sure.  Right.  And no, I mean, I was only like 18, 19 years old and they would let you in.  And just the impact that he had on me, he was one of the funniest people I ever saw from 
[01:58:00]  then on.  You would always keep seeing him.  You know, even though his act mostly didn't change over the past 20-something years.  I think there were a few new ones in there.  But that night, the girl I was with was just a very conservative girl, and boy, did I get  him an earful coming out that night.  Oh, really?  Especially she got up and decided to go to the bathroom during his set.  I think Otto was very particular because he absolutely came up with new stuff all the  time.  But it was small. 
[01:58:30]  It was a line or two.  You know what I mean?  But every time he had something new, it killed every time.  Every fucking time.  Oh, yeah.  I must have seen him at least five or six times over all the years and stuff like that.  And just, yeah, some of the stuff was the same and a lot of, you know, some of the stuff  was new.  But yeah, just every time.  But here's one of those comics, too, that you could go and see him do some of the same  stuff because you wanted to watch the reaction of the crowd.  Like, you knew what was coming.  So you're like, oh, fuck.  I want to see, like, what this old bag up front is going to do. 
[01:59:00]  And when that line comes out, you know?  Right.  But one time it always got me.  I forgot where the heck it was.  Some place in New Jersey.  And I guess he was getting ready to go up.  And he was sitting behind you with George.  And I guess he was warming up.  But they were basically having a conversation with each other.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We all saw a little of that over the years.  I used to bring him on stage sometimes because he hated when you refer to the puppet as a wooden  pal or wooden friend.  Oh. 
[01:59:30]  Just to annoy him.  Oh, no.  I would go on stage sometimes and say, please welcome Otto and his wooden buddy, George.  Because he hated being introduced like that.  Did he say something when you left the stage and he took the mic?  I don't remember.  I know that he probably was.  He probably had something under his breath.  He despised it.  Like a cocksucker motherfucker.  I'm sure, yeah.  Yeah.  He really loathed it.  Yeah.  There was one time I was sitting up close.  I used to be really friggin' fat.  I mean, I lost like 170 pounds over the past year.  Congrats. 
[02:00:00]  But, yeah, thank you.  But he looked at me, or the puppet looked at me, and just looked at me and went ring  ding.  Just out of nowhere.  Ring ding.  He would just do that.  It was so funny when he would just stop what he was saying, and then George would jump  in, but you're like, no, that's him.  Right.  He's doing the whole thing.  Yeah, but I didn't want to share that, guys.  I'm sorry to hear about, you know, talking about Otto.  Oh, my God.  Everyone.  Everyone's sad.  Are you kidding me?  He would grab, like, George's arm or the lapel of George's little jacket and be like, 
[02:00:30]  no, George, and pull him up.  Right.  Take your hands off me, cocksucker.  Take your hands off me.  Stop touching me.  Oh, freaking crazy.  All right, Corey.  Thanks.  Sweat, you Danish junkie.  Oh, that made me laugh.  A great fucking jab at himself.  We got Mike Francesa.  He was a huge fan of Otto.  I don't think.  What's up, Mike?  My condolences, man.  He's fucking one of my favorites, man.  He's seriously.  He's one of the comedians that fucking, you can tell his, like, repeated material. 
[02:01:00]  Somebody can repeat his material to you.  Like, I saw Otto at George, and he actually was fucking funny, like, coming from somebody  else.  Yeah, I'm very right.  Yeah, yeah, you're right.  Yeah.  And, uh, fucking so funny that I was listening recently to, like, the old NEW days, and fucking,  he wasn't even in the studio, just Ant doing the impression of George.  You guys were fucking with Dice.  And, uh, Dice was like, who is that?  Is that Otto in there?  And Ant's doing a puppet. 
[02:01:30]  He's going, no, it's just George.  And Dice was like, ah, they split up what happened to them.  You know what I mean?  Oh, they split up what happened to them.  Yeah, Dice obviously knows how to go with a good bit.  Exactly.  Right.  It was fucking great, man.  But, like I said, man, one of my favorites.  And, you know, it just, uh, it sucks.  Somebody mentioned that, you know, like, the life of wrestlers, man, the comedians are  right up there, man.  You know, all the good ones go.  You know what I mean?  So, like I said, uh, I didn't do the stupid voice today, so I just wanted to fucking,  you know, say I'm sorry, you fellas.  Talk to you guys later.  All right.  Thanks, Mike. 
[02:02:00]  I don't even know his real name.  I just know him as Mike Francesa.  That was kind of cool.  The amount of character.  Yeah.  Uh, Otto and George on, uh, The Late Show with David Letterman.  We should play this.  Wow.  Very funny on that.  This was around, uh, yeah, okay, 2007-ish?  They did Ventriloquist Week.  Right.  Oh, wow.  And, uh, Otto was the last one.  I think it was kind of a slam at Ventriloquist, but he did really well on Letterman.  He worked very well clean.  Wow.  Yeah, let's, uh, let's play this right now for Otto.  Thank you.  It's great to be here. 
[02:02:30]  Happy Valentine's Day, everybody.  I just hope to God you don't curse.  Nah, I'm not going to curse.  Happy Valentine's Day.  And look, I got a big heart on.  Would you like to touch it?  No, no, no, thanks.  Uh, just take this off here.  Yeah.  You look good.  Nice shirt.  I didn't know Ted Bundy had a catalog.  So, uh, what do you got planned for, uh, Valentine's Day?  Well, me and my girlfriend like to eat, you know?  So I'm going to take her to a nice restaurant for a romantic candlelit dinner, followed by 
[02:03:00]  a smooth elevator ride up to the room, and then I'm going to watch the Letterman show.  Well, of course.  Yeah.  And if she tosses when it's on, I'm going to crack her skull open with an ashtray.  That sounds real romantic.  Just don't curse.  Yeah, I can't curse that Entertainment Tonight can show Britney Spears Velcro when she's getting  out of the car with no underwear on.  I can't believe we're here at the Ed Sullivan Theater. 
[02:03:30]  This is just amazing, the history here, you know?  Elvis Presley, Jim Morrison.  Yeah, both dead.  Speaking of dead, are they storing the bodies in here?  I'm freezing.  It's freezing in here.  It's cold outside.  This gig sucks.  All right.  Oh, my God.  The Statue of Liberty has the torch under her dress.  All right. 
[02:04:00]  Ventriloquist leak.  Yeah.  You know what in mocking our profession?  Yeah, Letterman over there, the skinny guy.  Looks like Audrey Hepburn.  No, he looks good.  He should eat something.  You can afford it.  Have a gyro towel.  He looks like he should be a bouncer at a salad bar.  All right.  That's good.  By the way, I liked you in Cabin Boy.  That was your best work since Mork and Mindy.  He's like De Niro without the talent. 
[02:04:30]  All right.  Come on.  Paul Schaefer.  Yeah, he looks good.  Your barber call.  The turtle waxes in.  All right.  Stop it.  Does your head slide off the pillow at night?  He's like Letterman's puppet.  Who's working your head?  All right.  Be nice, George.  By the way, I drive the taxi here in New York. 
[02:05:00]  Anybody recognize me?  Hey, George, uh, have you ever had anybody really famous in your taxi?  Yeah, I had former governor of New York, Pataki, in the cab.  What kind of name is Pataki?  It sounds like something you stepped in on the way to the car, you know?  Hey, that's Pataki.  Walk around it.  All right.  Mommy, I made a Pataki.  Yeah.  Who else have you had? 
[02:05:30]  I had McGreevy, the governor of New Jersey.  I made him right up front.  He ain't sitting behind me.  Why don't you leave him alone?  It's an alternative lifestyle.  Yeah, right.  Being Amish is an alternative lifestyle.  All right.  What did the black lesbian say to the white lesbian?  You the man!  All right.  Hey, George, did you, uh, did you see Brokeback Mountain? 
[02:06:00]  Yeah.  What'd you think?  Loved him, hated him.  All right.  You know the original title of that was a fistful of testicles?  All right, no way.  All right, we better hurry up.  We got four minutes and they're throwing us out of here.  Try getting in this building tomorrow, Geppetto.  All right.  George, do you like plane travel?  Oh, man, it sucks.  Every time I get in an airplane, I'm never sitting next to a cute girl.  I'm always sitting next to some old guy that wants to talk, you know? 
[02:06:30]  Where you from?  Where you going?  Where am I going?  Look at your ticket.  That's where we're all going.  Oh, man.  I'd like to sing a song for Valentine's Day.  This is the love song from the movie Jaws.  Suddenly, I'm not half the man I used to.  Good crowd, right?  Yeah, and Sonny Bono's a good skier. 
[02:07:00]  All right.  I love Jaws.  Jaws was a great movie.  Remember the opening scene in Jaws?  This drunk girl goes swimming naked.  I'm drunk about it in water.  Come on in.  And then you hear,  Ta-dun.  Ta-dun.  Ah, ha, ha.  Come on in.  What is that?  Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.  Ah, ha, ha.  Doesn't this broad hear the music?  Get out of the water.  It's short music.  All right. 
[02:07:30]  Hey, is anybody here from New Jersey?  New Jersey?  Kill yourself.  What a polluted dunk New Jersey is now.  New Jersey, where a fart is refreshing.  Seriously.  Here's a poem I wrote about Jersey.  It's called Pollution.  It's a poem.  Go ahead.  I shot an arrow into the air.  It's stuck.  Thank you. 
[02:08:00]  Thank you.  Thank you.  Wow.  Jeez.  Yeah, you did very well there.  That was a ballier set than most comics have ever done on that show.  Sure.  Fistful of testicles.  Fistful of testicles.  It's funny, man.  Sonny Bono's a good skier.  He was brutal.  Try getting into this building tomorrow.  That's a good one.  That's a good one.  Ah, shit.  What did he say?  Loved him.  Hated him.  Loved him.  Hated him. 
[02:08:30]  That freaking sucks.  Yeah.  Yeah, damn.  That was a great set.  And I remember we all were a little excited for Otto.  Like, okay.  Yeah.  This is going to really push him forward, forward.  Yeah.  To more places.  Absolutely.  Oh.  Oh.  Let's take a look.  I always take a peek down the hall. 
[02:09:00]  What's the matter, Sam?  Nothing.  Oh.  How are you going to do your after show today?  What do you mean, how?  Well, you know, it's very hard to get through these moments.  I don't think you're professional enough to, you know, rise to the occasion.  Well, I mean, talk about Otto.  Oh, boy.  Reflect.  Reflect.  Yeah.  Reflecting.  And then, you know, worst case scenario, I'll try to get Sal and E-Rock to fight about  something.  That's always a good go-to. 
[02:09:30]  Yeah.  You need your go-tos.  Yeah.  Yeah.  People want us to play the Yoo-Hoo clip with Otto and Jay, but that was...  Yeah.  Yeah, that wasn't really a showcase of...  No.  Oh.  It was accusations and...  Yeah.  Yes.  Whatever.  It almost came to fisticuffs.  Not really.  All right.  We certainly could call it, so... 
[02:10:00]  Well...  If you want, we can end on a four-minute clip.  What do you got?  Uh, I have Big A and the Johnny Ola murder.  It's 4.15.  Sounds funny enough, just from the title.  Eric says it's good.  Johnny Ola.  Hey, Johnny Ola, take me here.  Oh, that one was great.  Stupid Fredo.  Yeah, it's fine.  So, um...  I don't know.  Whatever.  Yeah.  We'll see you guys tomorrow.  We're going to try the Johnny Ola murder on Big A, because you know how they do the myth 
[02:10:30]  busters?  It doesn't look like you could snap somebody's neck with a wooden hanger.  That fucking bottom part is pretty frail.  Yeah, yeah.  So I'm going to try and murder Big A on the next job.  Johnny Ola?  Yeah.  I'm going to see if that'll work.  Otto's a huge fan of Big A.  Who said Johnny Ola was killed with the hanger, or he killed somebody?  He was killed with it.  It was the bodyguard, the old man bodyguard that didn't even have a name.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Was it Rocco Lampone or no?  Yeah.  The bodyguard? 
[02:11:00]  I don't remember, but when they told Michael, your bodyguard is dead, he had no reaction.  He just went, so what'd you get my kid for Christmas?  It's like, no feeling.  I'm glad I'm here with movie aficionados.  Here's a quick, before you go, five minutes left.  Godfather question.  Yeah.  Original Godfather.  Okay.  How did...  This is not a quiz.  But how did the father, Don Corleone, how did he know after that meeting, when he said,  I did not know to this day that it was Barzini, how did he know what happened in the meeting 
[02:11:30]  for him to know that it was Barzini the whole time?  I knew he said it and he figured it out, but what instance happened for you to go back  and go, oh, this is what happened for him to know?  That was probably the one question everyone fucking had.  I think it was him, the way Barzini manipulated the meeting and ran the meeting and made it  happen.  I think Barzini, he was just a smart guy, Don Corleone.  And he was too agreeable. 
[02:12:00]  And he was like...  Yeah, he was too agreeable.  He was too agreeable.  And he said a refusal is not the act of a friend.  Yeah.  If he has them, he must share them.  Yeah.  And I think that was probably it.  It was probably that subtle way he led that meeting and got Don Corleone to concede his  point that he had been fighting with to tell you about.  And I think that's what he knew.  So it was never a moment.  It just was an overall theme.  Yeah, perceptive.  A mobster hunch that he knew from, you know, growing up.  Watched The Godfather 2.  And those guys just on a maybe that year did something. 
[02:12:30]  On a maybe, right, right.  You know, better, better, better.  I didn't know until this day.  Well, I kind of know.  Yeah.  Ah, fuck him anyway.  Yeah.  He didn't pass the ketchup that one time.  So fuck him.  Why take a chance?  Yeah.  But he said he goes, he could charge for these services.  He's not, we're not communists.  I think just the way he led it and made it happen.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Tipped him off.  Yeah.  Good enough.  That helps me to watch it again.  And wanted the drugs done.  I think it also said that Barzini wanted the drugs sold. 
[02:13:00]  Yeah.  Because I think...  Some real greaseball shit.  He might have thought that Barzini would side with him on no drugs.  Right, right.  But when Barzini said that, that indicated that he was on the side of the drugs being sold.  Yeah, yeah.  But didn't he kill...  That's true.  That's true.  Yeah, yeah.  But didn't they kill everybody anyway?  Yeah.  They were going to kill everybody, right?  Michael did.  And he knew he could make that swear, that oath.  And Michael would do it.  He knew Michael would do it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Don Corleone didn't have to do anything.  Even Stracci, who I have no idea who the fuck that was.  Stracci.  When he tells him, Stracci. 
[02:13:30]  Who's that?  What?  I thought he was all itchy and stuff.  I'm like, I'm crying with you.  You're fucking Stracci.  I bet he's Stracci.  He's going through the names, and he hears Stracci.  You're like, who?  Who the fuck was Stracci?  Yeah, he probably killed him on a horse's head.  So it was no definitive thing that happened then?  No.  No, I don't think there was one moment where they...  It wasn't such a blatant thing.  I think it would have been corny if it was this blatant...  Like, ha-ha, where he looked and curled his mustache and his fingers. 
[02:14:00]  Like he had his fingers crossed when he went, yeah, the piece is there.  When Michael found out Fredo did it, it was kind of a moment of dun-dun, like, that happened.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It wasn't like, oh, shit.  It was like, he fucked up, he lied.  So I thought it was maybe a moment there where he fucked up.  Yeah, Johnny Ola took me here.  Johnny Ola showed me.  What an asshole Fredo is.  Yeah.  No, no, we never met.  I never met.  Oh, no, no.  And then, like, five minutes later,  Ah, me and Johnny Ola!  Johnny comes here all the time.  What an idiot.  Fucking dummy beluga whale far-headed fuck. 
[02:14:30]  Then Michael...  Then Michael kissed him.  I was like, what, are you still getting fresh?  All right.  It's fucking Friday.  I ain't putting up with this shit.

Call up now.  866-WOW-1-WOW.  866-969-1969.  And be a part of the O.P. and Anthony Post Show with me, Sam Roberts.  Taking your phone calls on everything that went down today, of course.  Any memories of Otto and George, favorite moments, things you want to reflect on, feel free to share. 
[02:24:30]  Taking lots of calls.  866-WOW-1-WOW.  866-969-1969 to call in.  We found out earlier today, this morning while the show was on, that our friend Otto, from Otto and George, passed away.  Within the last couple days, I don't know if we know exactly what day it was, but we just found out this morning while the show was on.  So most of the second half of the show was spent kind of reflecting on his life and specifically his experience with the show. 
[02:25:00]  So, we'll get into that in a minute, but first, why don't we play Line of the Day, Sal?  Here comes Line of the Day!  Line of the Day!  Line of the Day!  Getting in our way, so if we have anything new... 
[02:25:30]  No doubt about it.  Fuck a right in the pussy!  Absolutely.  He felt compelled to get a fucker right in the room.  Whoever that guy is, just one Line of the Day.  So congratulations to that guy who, somebody from Minnesota, if you haven't seen that video,  we posted it on our Twitter and Facebook pages, which is at O&A Show.  I guess the Minnesota's college hockey team lost the NCAA hockey championships over the weekend 
[02:26:00]  and completely destroyed this announcer's live shot that he was doing for the news.  So it's a really, really funny video if you haven't checked it out.  But, I mean, the news of the day certainly was finding out that Otto from Otto and George passed away.  Now, we're not... we don't know how it happened.  I believe we know that he apparently died in his sleep.  But he was a part of the O&A Show for years and years, back to the WNEW days. 
[02:26:30]  I mean, easily 10 to 12 years he's been doing the O&A Show.  And, I mean, you heard, if you were listening to the end of the show, you heard his set on Letterman.  And, I mean, even as filthy a comedian as Otto was, even on Letterman, he's able to pull off a set like that, which was hilarious.  All of us, the mics were off, but all of us in the studio were laughing. 
[02:27:00]  He was, of course, part of the traveling virus tour that we did for a couple years.  And that's the thing.  He was able to pull off doing a set on Letterman, as well as going in front of an audience that really, when it boiled down to it,  the reason that they stopped, Opie and Anthony stopped doing the traveling virus tour was because the audience was simply out for blood.  I mean, they would go out of their way to make life tough for the comedians on stage. 
[02:27:30]  And Otto would just constantly have them in the palm of his hand.  But, such an interesting guy, too.  Do we have an Otto and George clip to start, Sal?  Yeah.  Do you want that gonorrhea clip that they were talking about?  Yeah, we were talking about the gonorrhea clip a little earlier.  Let's hear that.  I almost wish I was gay.  He's passing on his hands and I would love to rape him.  But is he doing pretty good?  Yeah, pretty good. 
[02:28:00]  Gentle?  Yeah.  Very nice.  Did you have a cheeseburger for dinner last night?  Yeah.  I was doing that.  I was just going to say, but no.  Oh, that must have been me.  Oh, I burped.  I was like, no, I had no cheeseburgers.  He's got to be the happy clown always.  I know.  It's like Tord Johnson bobbing for gonorrhea.  Hey, hey, I have no gonorrhea.  Don't give me a complex. 
[02:28:30]  What?  Yeah, don't give her a simplex.  We don't even have to bother later.  We don't even have to bother later.  Holy shit.  Does that conjure an image?  Pat, how's it going?  It's going quick.  And that's what it would be. 
[02:29:00]  Like, one of those spots, that was Pat from Munaki performing oral sex on a woman, I believe.  This was way back when we were on 57th Street and there were no bosses around to tell us that was completely against the rules.  But that's kind of a tough spot for a comedian to be in because generally not a lot is going to be able to take away from the attention to what's going on in the room.  But Otto was just, I mean, he was a sniper with his lines. 
[02:29:30]  I think he might have been, him and David Teller are probably the two best one-line artists to come into the Opie and Anthony studio, maybe ever.  Intern Adrian, you an Otto and George fan?  Yes.  Do you remember your first exposure?  With his show, yeah.  Listening to some of the older clips.  Yeah.  Especially the one, a lot of college brought up between him and Jay Moore.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Argued about the Yoo-Hoo.  Yeah, and they argue about that, but then, like, it kind of, because it's such a ridiculous premise. 
[02:30:00]  Like, they were arguing over who compared Yoo-Hoo to diarrhea first.  Yeah.  But then it leads you to listening to the actual joke and you're like, holy shit, there's something about when Otto does this.  It's an art.  Yeah, he was great.  You know?  So, let's go to Brady in Louisiana.  What's up, Brady?  Hey, I wanted to reflect on my first experience with Otto and George.  It was seventh grade, back when XM, before Sirius and XM merged.  And it was on the old comedy channel. 
[02:30:30]  I forget what the name of it was.  And it was me, my mom, and my dad in the car.  And Otto and George came on.  And all of a sudden, they just started telling cunt jokes out of nowhere.  And so, Dad and I are just howling.  And we listened to this for about a minute and a half before Mom makes us turn it off.  And I was laughing for, like, five minutes after that.  And then came on on your guys' show.  And it's really my first venture in the truly filthy comedy.  And I wanted to thank him for that.  And isn't it an amazing thing that somebody, because Otto was among the filthiest comics anywhere, 
[02:31:00]  and that somebody who has taken as much heat as he has for being filthy is bringing a father and a son together.  I mean, I don't know what that says about you and your dad, but you guys are bonding over all these sea bombs.  Yeah, it was a great, great family moment.  All right, what's now?  All right, thanks, Brady.  Eric in New York.  Yeah, hi, Sam.  Just so sad to hear him go. 
[02:31:30]  I mean, every time I hear of Otto and George, it just brings me back, my reference point, to the Mujon commercial on WNW.  It's just a classic, classic bit.  And it just came out of nowhere.  Yeah, we played that during the show a little earlier, but it was.  I mean, it was just, he didn't know it was a live read.  He didn't know, it was just like, here, let me tell you about this.  And he was able to just riff and create this thing that is maintained for over a decade.  Just amazing.  Just one more question for you. 
[02:32:00]  I may have gotten a ticket or two for the Unmask.  Would Opie and Anthony mind if I bring Lady Di as a date?  Yeah, I think they probably would mind.  But, I mean, if you have an extra ticket, what can we do?  Yeah, I guess I would like to use it.  I mean, they'd probably, yeah, they'd probably be upset about that.  Okay, then I won't upset them.  All right, I'll talk to you later.  I'll see you on Thursday at Unmask.  All right, bye-bye.  Bye.  Jay in Nyack. 
[02:32:30]  Oh, professional broadcaster, Sam Roberts.  It's an honor to be on your show, my friend.  Well, thank you.  Well, I share a lot of the same passion as you do with wrestling and WWE.  And I just couldn't believe when I turned the radio on and heard about Otto.  I don't have any really great funny stories, unfortunately, other than the fact that he made me laugh every time he was on your show or on ONA. 
[02:33:00]  And it's just like, I remember he was supposed to be on a couple of months ago or something and he didn't show up and you guys were like, you know, we can't reach him.  And I had a bad feeling right then because I know he, you know, he had issues in the past.  And I just hope and pray wherever he is now, he's happy and he rests in peace.  And just, you know, just lots of love and appreciation to him and his family and to the whole Otto and George, you know, family of comedians. 
[02:33:30]  I'm sure Jimmy Norton has got to be, you know, and that's a shout-out to Jim Norton if I could.  I missed his advice show.  And, you know, I wish I had more to add to that today, right?  No, that's good.  Thanks, Jay.  Yeah, man, thanks a lot.  And that's the thing that, you know, he did, he was guaranteed that he was going to slaughter every time he came on the ONA show.  Like, it wasn't about, you know, the long-form bits. 
[02:34:00]  It was whatever was going on in the studio that day would just be peppered in by some of the most disgusting, wittiest one-liners anywhere.  Let's go to Bello in Staten Island.  Hey, Jimmy.  I was just thinking the first time I saw him was probably 30 years ago in a bar in Staten Island.  And I'm always drunk and everything.  But, like you said, he just took control and it was amazing. 
[02:34:30]  And that's it.  Like, you're in a bar in Staten Island.  I'm sure everybody's drinking.  You know, it's just the worst crowd to perform in front of.  And he would just grab you.  So, yes, and he said that joke, what do you call it, for Puerto Rican, the quicksand, cuatro, cinco.  I'll never forget it.  Loved it.  And I love you, Sammy.  Thanks, bro.  Thank you, Bello.  866-WOW1-WOW, 866-969-1969 if you want to call up the post show and talk a little bit about Otto.  Because the other thing about it is, and he was like, he was the nicest guy that you'll ever meet. 
[02:35:00]  I mean, when I was doing my Sunday show live, he came up one Sunday and said,  Sam, I'm, you know, I want to come up and do your show.  And I said, of course.  And we got to talking.  And past all the, all his, his act, he was one of the most interesting people that you'll ever encounter just because of his life experiences.  Like, this was a guy who, from the time he was a kid, was performing on the streets of New York. 
[02:35:30]  Like, he was doing his ventriloquist act as a teenager on the sidewalk in New York City, back when New York City was, like, real New York City.  You know, like, taxi driver New York City.  I mean, he's got stories about being approached by John Lennon.  He performed for John Lennon on the street.  His, David Copperfield, the magician in Vegas, was such a big Otto and George fan that he has one of the original George puppets in his private collection.  That's true. 
[02:36:00]  I mean, it's amazing the amount of lives that this guy touched.  What's the next Otto bit that we want to play for the folks, Sal?  We have Otto on Jeff Dunham.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Let's hear that because, you know, obviously there are not a lot of successful ventriloquist acts.  So we have, yeah, Otto talking about Jeff.  Like, every radio show I've ever done, they always try and goat me into bad-mouthing Jeff Dunham.  I have nothing against the guy.  I mean, to me, he's more of, like, a Jim Henson than what I do. 
[02:36:30]  I have the one character that's a domineering character.  He's got a thousand little creatures.  And they always try and, like, get me to bash the guy.  I have nothing, you know.  Yeah, that fucking rich guy.  Yeah.  That successful guy.  He's an interesting guy.  I've had him on.  He's a wonderful entertainer.  He's cool, Todd.  I have a great Dunham story.  I was playing in Vegas years ago at the Riviera and was working for Steve Sharippa, Bobby Bacaloff and the Sopranos.  So I play in the comedy room, which is like a 300-seat room.  And Dunham, he booked Dunham the same week as me in the big room where Dean Martin used to play. 
[02:37:00]  And all I see is Dunham's picture all over the fucking casino in the elevators.  And normally when I arrived at the hotel, I'd see my picture within five minutes of walking in the hotel.  So I called up Shariffa, and he's a scary guy to talk to.  You know, every conversation he says, I'll bury you in the desert if you don't do the full time.  You know, that's how he talks to you.  He's a big, intimidating guy.  I can see why they hired him for that role.  And so I called him up pretty much screaming at him. 
[02:37:30]  I go, why is Dunham here the same week as me?  Why is there two ventriloquists?  Why is his picture everywhere?  He goes, are you giving me shit?  And he goes, you're funny, and he's not.  If he goes, if you give me any more shit, I'll kick everybody out of this fucking hotel and put puppets in every room.  And then we immediately, both of us just cracked up at the absurdity of that statement.  I'll put puppets in every room.  And then he just started laughing at just the fucking, it was so absurd.  Fucking crazy.  I couldn't believe I screamed at him, though. 
[02:38:00]  Yeah.  Because that's a weird booking to have both you guys.  I didn't get it.  I didn't get it.  Did you have people show up?  Kind of dumb.  Yeah, I had a normal.  The Penn Jillette always brings 50 people to see me.  When Dunham came, and he was groveling and kissing my ass.  Oh, wow.  It was great.  You know, he was a really nice guy.  That's the, I mean, you don't have to stop mid-word, but that's the other thing.  I mean, you just heard Penn Jillette goes and brings 50.  I mean, Penn Jillette, who does the show all the time, maybe we'll try to get him on the phone or something tomorrow,  because I'd love to hear his reflections. 
[02:38:30]  Penn adores Otto.  I mean, he has come on this show so many times to talk about the affection that he has for Otto.  And I know that last caller, a couple callers ago, had said that they had heard that he had had problems or whatever.  But as far as any of us know here at the show, he was in good health.  You know, Otto has had somewhat of a history with some substances or whatever.  But as far as any of us know, and Bob Levy was on the show today to talk about it a little bit, 
[02:39:00]  he was not using.  He had had health problems about a year ago.  He was stuck in Canada, and he was hospitalized.  But he recovered from that, and he had been on the show since then, and he seemed healthy and everything.  So, you know, I just don't want anybody to jump to conclusions as to what caused the death of Otto,  which is what we're talking about today.  But, again, if you have anything you want to add to the conversation, call up 866-WOW1-WOW. 
[02:39:30]  866-969-1969.  And we have one more clip that we want to play before we run out of time.  Is that right, Sal?  Yes, it's Lady Palm's Otto in the head.  Of course.  One of my favorite things, we did a gig in Delaware.  Yeah.  It was a giant fucking, this is many years ago, a giant room, like a big bar.  And afterwards, I was out there, and Otto killed, and I had a great set. 
[02:40:00]  And there was a girl that walked up to me, and she didn't know Otto was the ventriloquist  because he didn't have George with him in the parking lot.  And she just, everyone focuses on George.  So she goes, you were really funny.  And she goes, I liked you more than the last guy.  And he was really funny, but he was more of a guy's comic.  Like, she did enjoy you, but you're very harsh for a young fucking girl.  Yeah.  And her head was not shaped good.  Oh, shit.  She had a really bad hairline.  Oh, no. 
[02:40:30]  And when she said, like, he was a good comic, but more of a guy's comic, Otto said, yeah,  well, you're really pretty, except for your forehead, it's too big.  And she was so hurt, she took her palm, and she palmed Otto with a forehead.  Holy shit.  Wow, she must have been upset.  Dude, it was so uncomfortable and fucking great.  Good.  Fuck her.  She palmed Otto.  Did you like that?  It's one of my, said the worst thing to say.  I remember that exchange in the parking lot like it happened four minutes ago. 
[02:41:00]  That's hilarious.  What did you laugh at more, me getting hit or her?  The whole thing of it was, the fact that you just, you went to, you went to,  her making an offhanded remark, you went right for the Achilles.  Yeah.  You sliced her Achilles, and because you said forehead, she just palmed your forehead.  She didn't know how to handle it.  She didn't know how to react to it.  It was everything that she's ever been afraid a guy would say to her.  Right.  No guy has ever said that.  Like, they've all talked to her and looked up at her fucking bad hairline, but she sees 
[02:41:30]  the eyes go up, but she's never actually had a guy say it to her.  Wow.  Oh, man.  It's too big.  Absolutely.  In hindsight, she did try and spare my feelings by saying I'm a guy, kind of, and all that.  She didn't know it was you at first for a second, but she really was, she was saying  that sincerely.  Yeah.  She just thought you were harsh, but funny.  God, I'm a vindictive, vicious asshole.  Well, my heart.  She'll learn.  Fuck her.  Hydrocephalous head.  She'll learn last time to fucking think before she speaks.  She taught her a lesson.  That's why, this is what makes Otto, like, the comedian's favorite comedian, because he 
[02:42:00]  goes and gets smacked in his head in the parking lot, and he talks about what a funny story  it was.  There are a lot of people who would not enjoy repeating the fact that one of the audience  members was so upset by what they said that they had to physically assault them, but Otto  was a real comedian.  Chris in Jersey.  Hey, I was just wondering if you think that Nancy Grace believed that it was steroids that  killed Otto.  You know, I wouldn't be surprised if that miserable person decided to launch an investigation 
[02:42:30]  into the deaths of comedians, as many as we've had recently.  Well, again, I think Jim Florentine is going to be on the show tomorrow, so I'm sure we'll  talk more about it then.  Hopefully we'll get some more information, because I know when stuff like this happens,  especially with somebody, I guess people listen to this show regularly and religiously,  and they kind of, you feel close to the people that you hear on Opie and Anthony. 
[02:43:00]  So everybody's going to want to know what happened with Otto, and we'll get that information  to you as soon as humanly possible.  Shane in New York.  Hey, what's up, Sam?  I was on your show with Otto.  He brought me in just as a friend.  That guy was one of the best fucking guys.  I'm just beside myself right now, man.  I mean, and that's what I don't want people to lose, because he was such a brutal comic  that he's one of the sweetest guys that ever walked into the studio. 
[02:43:30]  Absolutely.  I mean, for him to bring me on, I mean, because he liked the way I just told a story.  I'm sorry.  I'm repeating myself.  I'm just freaking out, brother.  Yeah, well, good luck, man.  That's tough.  Joe in Jersey.  Hey, what's up, Sam?  How are you doing, buddy?  One of the best stories about Otto with the John Lennon thing is what had happened was  he was performing, and John Lennon's there with Yoko, and he's doing his bit, and then 
[02:44:00]  John Lennon walks up to him and gives him two bucks and says, here, $1.50 for the puppet  and $0.50 for you, because you didn't do that much.  And the best part, the best part of it is that, and then as Lennon goes by, Lennon  gives him an elbow.  You know, like with your pals, you get a little boom.  He gives Otto like a shove, and we were talking about it one day.  I'm like, Otto, man, what are you, a pussy?  Why'd you let him do that? 
[02:44:30]  He's like, dude, he was a fucking peedal.  What do you want me to do with him?  If he was one of the monkeys, it would have been go time.  And it's a really horrific, horrific day for us, you know, who were really tight with  him, and we're still trying to, you know, we're just still trying to come to grips with  it, but he's got so many great stories.  There are just so many hilarious and interesting things, hanging out with Belushi one night.  I mean, you know, he's just got so many great things, and he's so fascinating because he 
[02:45:00]  just, one night we were doing a show somewhere, and some guy's sitting at a bar, and everybody's  looking at the guy, and we all recognized the guy somewhere, and it was the guy who  was in Superman 2, one of the three villains, you know, the three villains?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, of course.  Right?  It was the one that didn't speak, so we're all sitting here, and all of a sudden, Otto's  like, I know you, you're Jack O'Helloran from My Queen's Fair Lady, some movie from  like 1963.  I'm like, who recognizes him from that?  Yeah, how would you know that? 
[02:45:30]  I know that.  I gotta let you go, Joe, but we're running out of time.  But I appreciate the call, dude.  You got it, Sam.  All right, I'll talk to you later.  Good luck.  Bye.  And I see all the rest of you on hold right now.  I wish I could get to you, but I don't have time.  But yeah, so we'll get you more information as it comes.  Sal, can you put the bed on so I can organically go into a commercial after talking about the  memory of one of our great friends, Otto?  Yes.  Now moving on to the commercial.

It's the best of Opie and Anthony.  You know, we've all had our asses licked and toyed with.  And so I was getting mine fingered a little bit.  Now, are you talking the tip of the pinky up to the first knuckle or are we talking... 
[02:53:00]  Or a big fat thumb.  Yeah.  At first it was a thumb.  Jesus, look at these pictures.  It was Danny Brown.  But it was slightly unpleasant.  Oh.  During my spanking.  The thumb was slightly unpleasant.  You had a spanking?  Who doesn't?  What are you doing?  You're wayward.  That's a little rough.  What was slightly unpleasant about it?  The nail on it.  It didn't...  It was just like, eh, I just didn't...  You know, my ass is not particularly used to that.  So we tried the pointer finger.  And while there was less girth to it, there was still a nail on it, which was freaking me out. 
[02:53:30]  Yeah, you didn't want any abrasions.  No!  So, um, a while ago, my girl had been out at my request and purchased a strap-on.  Uh-huh.  Not a particularly big one, very small one, and a belt.  How small?  Like a Sharpie?  Maybe five inches.  Small.  Like whatever small size is.  Would this be, like, the attachment?  Bigger than the Sharpie?  Nah, it's about that long. 
[02:54:00]  About as long as the Sharpie.  And now what about...  A little thicker.  A little thicker, but not much.  Oof.  But, um...  It wasn't that I just...  It's something I'm like, yeah, I'll try it eventually.  We get it.  And I'm like, you know what?  Let's try that, because it's blunt, and it's not...  There's no nail on it.  Doesn't have a nail on it?  Right.  I like your logic.  So.  I like the logic.  I have a finger to a whole involved thing with a strap on.  Your logic is great. 
[02:54:30]  So, um, you know...  Yeah.  Yeah, fuck.  What color was it?  Purple.  You wanted an alien to fuck you?  Well, better that than a fleshy, regular one with a fucking helmet on it.  Black one?  Yeah, no, no, no, no.  Um, so we get the old magic belt on, and I, uh...  Did she look silly with the magic belt on?  No.  No.  Okay.  Relatively cool.  All right.  Like a superhero.  Did she feel silly?  A superhero. 
[02:55:00]  Did she feel silly?  Yeah.  No.  These are normal questions.  She couldn't wait to get the...  You've never seen someone more chopping at the bits.  Chopping at the bits.  I think she had some anger in her.  Yeah.  That she wanted to get out.  Really wanted to teach somebody a lesson.  Mm-hmm.  Um, well, I should only make a mental note not to do this during PMS times.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  She might get a little angry.  So I'm on my stomach, and, uh, I guess maybe a little goes in, and it's really hurting.  I'm like, yes, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. 
[02:55:30]  Uh, and she's like, just relax.  You're tensing up.  I'm like, of course I am.  Trying to fuck me in the butt.  You guys are like a sitcom.  Yes, we are.  You really are.  Yeah, but it's a bad guy.  The old, the old, uh, Three's Company spin off The Rapers.  That is the Ropers.  Um, so she, uh, pushes a little bit in, and it's hurting.  So I lay on my back, and I have my shirt on, so my fat stomach does an accordion.  And she kind of, she's kneeling, and she kind of puts her legs under my legs.  Oh, okay, that move. 
[02:56:00]  And gets a little bit in, maybe an inch and a half in, two inches max.  And I just have to keep, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, I'm gonna  shit, I'm gonna shit, I'm gonna shit, I'm gonna shit.  You're gonna shit?  Oh, you really feel like you're gonna shit.  Oh, why is that?  Yeah, and, um, it was just, it's just a feeling you get.  Like, you know, you go to the doctor, and the finger goes all the way in, that's what  you feel like, so.  Ow.  All right with the music, we got it, turn it off, fucking Christ. 
[02:56:30]  What was it, a fucking Zoo Crew show?  What?  Fucking.  A fucking music bed, we got it.  They really want us to have more production elements on our show, Jimmy.  I don't mind it one time, I'm not yelling at Travis, I don't mind it one time through,  but then it starts up again, it's like, all right.  That's what happened to Marcela's father.  You want some nice music?  I don't want any music, I don't talk over our music bed, we're not a top 40 station.  We gotta pump up the story with a little music.  I don't need the story pumped up, I was gonna be fucked in the ass with a purple dick.  Do you have purple Peter, people eat it all?  Oh.  So, was she, uh, was she, uh, uh, lubed up? 
[02:57:00]  Oh, you bet.  A lot of lube.  Yeah, am I a fucking masochist?  Yes.  And she's getting annoyed at me, she's like, just relax.  And I'm like, I'm trying to relax, and then a little bit of a good,  I have to shit, I have to shit, I have to shit.  Think how many times you've pushed your cock into a girl's ass.  Yes.  And just like, they just take it, they don't even think what it's doing to her.  Well, I had to jump up at one point and run to the,  I'm like, yeah, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.  And then she stopped, and I ran into the bathroom because I had farts. 
[02:57:30]  Oh my god, I'm what a mess.  And she's like, and I'm like, stop, stop, stop, stop.  And she's like, it's okay, she didn't want to stop.  I'm like, I, I, I, I, she's like, nothing's gonna come out.  And I'm like, yes it is.  So I ran into the bathroom and I made farts.  And I sat on the toilet.  And I fucking pushed out like.  But nothing came out.  Right.  So she and I were both right.  Like, there was something building in there.  You, um, she should have driven it home like that horse did on that guy. 
[02:58:00]  It fucking.  Oh my god, if she would have just went, wham, and shoved it up your ass.  No, but I thought of that.  I'm like, I, I actually had the weird thought in my head.  I'm like, what if I was going to prison in two weeks?  And like, she was just kind of loosening me up.  Training you so you could take it in the ass.  Like, how would I survive that life?  Like, the, I wasn't saying it to be sexy.  I was like, the agony that I would feel.  And you know the first one would not be a thin little strap on.  Purple one, no.  Where, where a lot of lube is used.  And she's being gentle.  It would be a, a spit on giant fat cock. 
[02:58:30]  Uh, and he would not be very nice to you.  Dude, that fucking pain.  And so she goes, get on your hands and knees.  We tried it again.  She goes, maybe on your hands and knees.  She goes, it will be better.  On the stomach is crazy.  On your back.  So I got on my hands and knees.  And you do feel silly.  And she's behind me.  Of course you do.  And she put, she put like, she got like two inches in.  Yeah.  And I started kind of pushing back on it.  And she really liked that.  Oh.  A little bit.  But I couldn't get any more in.  I was just kind of pulling up and pushing back on it.  Oh.  And it just fucking, I, I don't think. 
[02:59:00]  Was she giving a little push?  A little bit.  But she was letting me do the work.  But she really liked that.  Was she grabbing your hips?  I don't remember.  She might have been smacking me a little bit.  I don't remember.  I think she was just kind of, you know, hanging back and letting things happen.  Your honesty is amazing.  I don't care.  The fuck do I care?  It was my chick.  I didn't want to go.  Nothing but respect.  I'm just saying.  The honesty is amazing.  Honestly, dude, I want, I want to enjoy that so much.  Because I have no homophobia about it.  I don't care.  I don't care.  It's my girl.  I don't want a guy to fuck me. 
[02:59:30]  It's one more dirty thing to do with a girl.  I'm fucking, I'm a pervert.  I want to enjoy that so much.  But it's just like the physical pain of it.  I can't do.

You're listening to the Opie and Anthony channel on SiriusXM. 
[03:04:00]  The Joe Rogan experience begins now.  Buckle up, bitches.  Here we go.  Powerful Amy Schumer.  Can we start every show that you're on like that?  With a little song?  Please.  Powerful Amy Schumer song?  I would love it.  Thank you.  I want to be brought on stage that way.  Why not?  You can do it.  You can demand that.  People have riders.  Yeah.  A lot of people have riders.  Yeah.  They put a lot of weird shit in there, like white M&Ms and fucking...  I heard I have the cheapest... 
[03:04:30]  The guy I've been on the road with said I have the cheapest rider he's ever seen in his life.  Really?  Yes.  Cheapest?  Cheapest.  Like, what's your rider?  What do you require?  It's like, honestly, vegetables and fruit for a smoothie.  Like some Greek yogurt.  It's just like...  He's like...  Beautiful.  Perfect.  And then wine, which I tell him to hide from me unless I ask for it.  What about a pair of white sneakers?  I should do that.  Clean.  I need like a hip hop...  I need a hip hop vibe.  I've got nothing.  Well, there's some artists that do demand things like that.  They demand like...  Every time I go to one of these places, I always ask the guys backstage, like, what's 
[03:05:00]  the craziest shit you've ever seen?  Yeah.  Because a lot of these dudes that are like working in these comedy clubs or these...  Especially these theaters that have seen like rock and roll bands coming through.  You always want to know.  Like, what?  Come on, man.  What's the craziest shit you've seen?  Just rock and roll coke stories for the most part.  That's what everybody has.  I mean, I wouldn't repeat the stories because I wouldn't want to get anybody in trouble.  Oh.  But they're mostly just coke and naked people stories.  The funniest one I ever heard was T.J. Miller, that comic.  He asked for either an actual or a picture of a pinata in the greenery. 
[03:05:30]  So, like, sometimes the promoter has to, like, draw the picture of a pinata.  I'm like, that's awesome.  I wish I...  I've got nothing exciting on there.  But until recently, there was some mistake where it told drivers not to look at me or  not to talk to me.  Like, something was in there.  And in December, I heard that and I go, oh, my God, that's not supposed to be there.  Please take that out.  And they haven't.  I just found out they didn't.  So, it's so...  Because I'm always like, why is there such horrible tension on this ride? 
[03:06:00]  And then they're like...  They're like...  And I'll talk to them.  They're like, oh, you know, it says I'm not supposed to...  And I'm like, oh, my God, that's so embarrassing.  Like, me being like, no, don't talk to me.  I've had that in my rider accidentally as well.  Not even accidentally.  Like, it was a conversation that somebody must have had with someone.  Like, you shouldn't talk to them.  It's like, what are you talking about?  Like, that's ridiculous.  Yeah.  I used to be really pained by small talk, actually.  Like, on the road.  Because you have so many little interactions.  But Colin Quinn, like, really turned me on to small talk. 
[03:06:30]  He goes so hard into small talk that, like, people go the other way.  It's like an art form to him.  One driver at a time.  One person who works at a hotel.  Like, he just...  He'll small talk you to death.  And it really has, like, sort of changed the road for me.  I've had some great drivers.  I've had some really, really hilarious dudes.  I had a dude in New Orleans that grew up in New Orleans and had no idea how crazy New  Orleans was.  Craziest place I've ever been.  Yeah.  And in comparison to the rest of the country, like, there's certain things you just get 
[03:07:00]  away with in New Orleans.  Yeah.  Like, walking down the street with an open beer.  Like, he was...  The cops pulled him over.  He was...  And he was only, like, you know, a couple hours outside of New Orleans, he said.  He drove a couple hours.  And he's out there with a beer, like, sitting there by his car, drinking this beer.  And the cop pulls over.  And the cop starts asking him questions.  And while the cop's talking to him, he puts the one beer down and cracks open another one.  Oh, my God.  Like, nothing.  Like, nothing.  He starts drinking the second beer.  And the cop was like, are you out of your fucking mind? 
[03:07:30]  Like, what are you doing?  He goes, wait a minute.  The cop goes, where are you from?  And the guy goes, New Orleans.  And he's like, oh, okay.  Yeah.  Listen, you can't do that here.  Right.  You can't do that anywhere else.  Yeah.  You live in a crazy place.  It's such a culture.  I love it there.  That's also my favorite place.  But I've seen the worst stuff there.  The worst stuff?  The worst.  Violence?  The combination of everything bad.  And I went to college in Baltimore.  Like, not a coincidence that they filmed The Wire there.  But in New Orleans, I was like 17.  I was there in a volleyball tournament. 
[03:08:00]  And I was in a Haagen-Dazs.  And I saw these, like, two guys straight from the bayou.  And they were talking.  They were both, like, hitting on this girl.  And they didn't know that it was a hooker.  And they didn't know that it was a guy.  You know?  And I was, like, 17.  I was like, ooh, that's dark.  And they were, like, both, like, celebrating that this hot girl was talking to them.  And I was like, oh, one of them is about to catch a dick.  That's hilarious.  Yeah.  But I love that city.  It's my favorite.  A friend of mine once in California, my friend Eddie, we were in, we were right by the comedy  store.  You know, that hotel by the comedy store? 
[03:08:30]  That ramp that's going up?  Yeah.  And this woman was driving up the hill.  And my friend Eddie was like, dude, that chick is so fucking hot.  Oh, my God.  Look how hot that girl is.  Yeah.  And she was a transvestite who had, a transsexual, that had done a piece on the man show with  us.  And I said, oh, I know her.  And I'm like, she's a he.  And he's like, no fucking way.  I go, well, not anymore she's not.  Yeah.  But she used to be.  I guess she still kind of is, because she has a penis still.  Yeah.  And he was like, what?  What was the name of transsexual and transvestite? 
[03:09:00]  Transsexual is someone who has gotten their sex changed.  Okay.  Transvestite is someone who dresses as a woman.  You know, you could be a cross dresser, too.  Yeah.  It's kind of weird when you define, you know, like what they are.  Like what is a person who dresses like a woman?  Would Jim Norton fuck them?  But I mean, not even if they, I mean, not even like a sexual thing, because if a dress  like, I think you could be a transvestite and be completely heterosexual.  Like Eddie Izzard, I think, just cross dresses or he did anyway, but doesn't like it's very 
[03:09:30]  straight.  I think.  Right.  I don't know.  You know, I, I don't know why he did that, but it worked, whatever it is.  Unstoppable.  And it's obviously that he's got talent outside of that, but whatever it is, it worked.  He, um, he did an amazing thing once where he ran around Europe.  Did you ever see that documentary?  No.  My respect for him shot through the roof.  See, that annoyed me.  I don't even know anything about it, but him doing that, like it makes me feel lazy.  And right away I'm like, ugh. 
[03:10:00]  You don't have to see it to understand what he did, um, because it was incredibly impressive.  It was, I guess it was on the UK on TV and it didn't get on TV in America.  You got to watch it on the internet.  But he ran like every day, he ran a marathon and he, yeah, he ran all around Europe.  It's insane.  What he did was insane.  He also does his act like an Arabic.  He does his act in like a bunch of different languages.  Yeah.  He's a bad motherfucker.  It might not be Arabic.  I may be like.  Whatever he does it in.  He's a bad motherfucker.  That guy's amazing.  He's like Beyonce.  He ran around the fucking, I mean, he's not an athlete.  This is the thing. 
[03:10:30]  He didn't do it when he was in shape.  He did it when he was fat.  He just did it.  He just forced his body to do it.  He finished a 1,100 mile marathon around Britain.  Oh my God.  Yeah.  That was like a fake headline.  I can't believe this.  Exactly.  But so right away you like just respect that because right away I think, what are you running  from?  What are you trying to escape from?  And maybe that's my defense mechanism.  But no, I don't think he's escaping or running from anything.  He did it all for charity and he had a goal.  I'm a monster.  He set this goal in his mind and he just decided to try to complete this goal. 
[03:11:00]  What was the charity, Jamie?  Does it say?  Yeah, I think Sports Relief.  I don't know.  Eddie is finishing.  I don't know.  I don't know.  He looks great there.  That might just be a website that sponsored it.  There was some aspect of it was related to charity.  Oh my God.  His body transformed during the time he did it.  He ran a thousand fucking miles, but like he had the most horrendous blisters on his  feet.  I mean, his skin was torn apart on his feet just because his body was just so unused to 
[03:11:30]  this.  I mean, that's something you try just trying to build up to running a marathon, just a  marathon.  That's a fucking serious physical undertaking.  I could not do a 3K right now.  I'd be like, whatever the charity, I couldn't do it.  This guy did a hundred of them.  I mean, Jesus Christ.  It's sad that I never heard of that.  How many did he run?  30 or something like that?  43 and 51 days.  43 marathons?  They didn't even put it on TV in America.  And were all of them a standard marathon rate of 26 miles?  Is that what it is? 
[03:12:00]  That's a marathon, right?  Is that-  26 miles?  Yeah.  That's incredible.  Is that the YouTube video or like a website?  No, but there is a YouTube video of it.  You can watch the whole thing every step of the way.  And there was parts of it where he was running really, really, really, really slow, but he  did not fucking quit.  It's incredible.  Like, you know, you just look at this guy pushing himself.  His knees are falling apart.  His feet's falling apart.  And he just gets up there and he just fucking keeps running.  I just think I can't help it.  I'm like, what's he running from?  But why is he running from something if he's trying to accomplish something? 
[03:12:30]  Well, because I'm projecting.  I'm like, why would I do that?  Right.  Like, you don't want to date anybody that shows up at the gym at 6 a.m.  Like, come on.  No, I think being motivated and wanting to take care of yourself is one thing.  But then I think something that insane, I mean, if it's to raise money for charity, like,  why don't you do stand-up and they'll put that on TV in America?  Because you set a goal.  Set a goal to see if he could pull it off.  I think we have to agree to disagree because I don't think it's cool. 
[03:13:00]  And I like him and I think he's really funny.  And so I feel bad.  No, look, you've got a point.  You've got a point.  I mean, why not just ask people to donate the money or donate the money yourself?  You've got a point.  No, but I mean, but not like, I mean, of course, then why even have a fundraiser?  But I'm just saying to do that, I don't know.  I know zero about it except what you just told me.  But right away, that's what I think.  But I'm also a jerk.  Well, here's another optimistic way of looking at it or positive way of looking at it.  He's also, on top of what he's doing, he's inspiring people. 
[03:13:30]  Not me.  Because what he did is an incredible accomplishment.  Running 1,100 miles or whatever the fuck you wrote.  What did it inspire you to do?  What did you do?  It didn't inspire me to do anything.  It inspired a great feeling in me.  Really?  I don't even know what the charity is.  You just thought like that's amazing.  Well, you just appreciate humans doing amazing shit.  And I just, I'm like, eh.  Every year of the marathon.  No, but I really like going down to the marathon in New York and like rooting.  So like everyone's so excited, it's like really emotional, but I'm like, you know. 
[03:14:00]  Do you give a shit about the Olympics when the Olympics come around?  I, I, I, not the Winter Olympics.  I just cannot give a shit about the Winter Olympics.  But I like the, I like gymnastics.  I get into some, some Olympics.  You know what's the biggest tragedy in all sports is that the Olympics, that they don't pay the athletes.  Oh, I thought it was like Nancy Kerrigan being beat.  No, the, those have, those are professional athletes.  You know, the idea that they're amateur athletes is fucking preposterous.  The amount of revenue that gets generated by their athletic performances is fucking staggering. 
[03:14:30]  Wait, because it's so much?  Yes, it's an incredible amount of money.  But only a couple of them, right?  It's an incredible amount of money that the Olympics itself generates.  Oh, and the day gets, okay.  The Olympics itself, when people are watching the Olympics, there's fucking millions of people around the world.  Well, untold millions watching at the same time.  And the advertising revenue is stupendous.  I mean, they must make unbelievable amounts of money.  Right.  It costs a lot of money to put it on.  It's not a free event. 
[03:15:00]  But the amount of profit that's generated by the Olympics must be fucking phenomenal.  Yeah, it's an excellent opportunity for young athletes.  You know what would be more excellent?  Pay them, bitch.  That's so true.  Give them some fucking money.  These little girls.  Not a little money either.  A shit ton of money.  They throw away their entire childhoods, and then one of them makes a lot of money.  And there's like a dozen girls never getting their period.  There should be some...  So you could watch them for a week.  There should be some sort of scale, you know, where a certain amount of accomplishment leads to a certain amount of revenue. 
[03:15:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, because that's the thing.  When you're younger, you're like, oh, if you make it to the Olympics, you're just rich.  I thought it was like Hunger Games, and you were like a victor.  You just win so much money.  But really, it's like, well, even ballerinas, I'm like, oh my God, only like a handful of you make it where you can make a bunch of money.  And still, you're just beating your body to a pulp.  But then a lot of them like never even get there and make no money.  A lot of them, right?  Like what's the number? 
[03:16:00]  I don't know.  No, I talked to a ballerina last season of my show, and she said, like, if you're starring in a ballet, if you're like the New York ballerina, you make like, I think, under $500 a year.  How much do Olympic athletes...  And that's the best ballerina.  That's what...  But this...  I don't know how much this girl...  Do Olympic athletes actually make some money?  Okay, it does say they do...  This is the actual numbers.  The Olympic Committee awards cash prizes to Olympians who win a medal. 
[03:16:30]  $25,000 for a gold, $15,000 for a silver, and $10,000 for a bronze.  But the money is considered earned income abroad and subject to IRX taxation.  So when you win an Olympic gold medal, you win $25,000.  That's so depressing.  That's, you know, hey, that's a good wage if you're a fucking Burger King employee.  Yeah, that's horrible.  It's unbelievable.  But what's the hope?  That you're like the one person that they're like, okay, now, like Nike or somebody wants 
[03:17:00]  to...  Exactly.  That sucks.  You'll get sponsored.  You'll be sponsored by several different companies.  You'll make some money off of that.  And, you know, maybe you'll be able to do seminars and shit.  $25,000.  To get the gold.  I talked to a model also.  Some motherfuckers.  Like, I was like, what do models make?  Like, are they just...  But the ones at the very top of the game, of course, are making tons of money.  But the, like, really beautiful chicks that are working models make around that.  Like, they make, like, maybe $50,000 a year from that. 
[03:17:30]  See, that's not what I've heard.  Really?  Because, yeah, my buddy's dating this chick who is a model, and he tells me...  Like, model in quotes?  She's banging.  No, she's, like, a real model.  A real model.  Okay.  Like, she's doing advertising campaigns, and she makes...  Sometimes she makes $6,000 a day, $15,000 in a day.  She's made as much as $25,000 in a day.  Yeah?  Just posing.  She's not famous.  She's young.  Yeah?  Yeah, she has stupid amounts of money.  Oh, well...  I think it varies, is what I'm trying to say.  But even, like...  If you're on a big campaign, I think it varies. 
[03:18:00]  I know only, like, three models.  But they work, and they've gotten a campaign here and there.  They are on the runway.  And it sounds like once...  It's like a corporate.  Like, once in a while, they'll have a pretty good payday, but it's not consistent.  And it's not that much.  It didn't sound like that much to me for being that hungry all the time.  Honestly.  Well, some of them, isn't it?  It's just they can do it naturally.  Like, some of them don't have to struggle as much.  Like, weight-wise?  They just have that body shape, that ectomorphic body shape.  Like, the... 
[03:18:30]  Honestly, I've only talked to three models, because it's not fun to be around them.  But, uh...  But they, um...  Even if they're, like, naturally pretty thin, they still, before doing that stuff, had to  do liquid stuff, and...  And, uh...  What's the thing where you shoot saline in your...  What?  In your butthole?  You shoot saline...  Oh, that thing.  What the fuck are you talking about?  Oh, an enema.  They'd have to do, like, these...  Something like enemas.  Oh, I thought it was, like, a treatment or something.  That thing you do before...  You make me do before the show?  Shut up!  I don't think this place seems that clean. 
[03:19:00]  It's clean.  Trust me.  It just...  It looks rustic.  No, I love doing his podcast, though.  He's always giving me enemas right before.  It's so weird.  I trust him.  I don't want you to have to shit in the middle of the broadcast and ruin what I know is going  to be the best podcast ever.  All right.  I guess you're right.  Let's pull through this, Amy Schumer.  You're right.  Yeah.  Enemas.  Where were we?  Oh, models.  Yeah.  What the fuck is it about anybody...  Like, why would anybody get really hung up on the idea of incredibly skinny people wearing  their clothes? 
[03:19:30]  I don't know, but it looks good.  But what I've heard is that it's like a hanger.  That's the idea.  Yeah.  That you want them almost built like a hanger.  Well, I just had a fitting today, and it was like with someone who knew what they were  doing, which I haven't had that much of, you know?  Right.  And she told me that it's all about proportion.  Because like a lot of people, they think that I'm like actually bigger than I am.  Like people...  I'm a size six, and people...  I don't know what that means.  Like bigger than a four, smaller than an eight.  Okay.  Anyway, but then like they've been like... 
[03:20:00]  But on like there's some websites or whatever, because you can like be like, what's her  bra size or what's her size?  Oh, come on.  Really?  I mean, people will be like, yeah.  But I think there's like websites that say I'm like a 12 or something, but whatever.  But anyway, it's all about proportion and not really about how big or small somebody  actually is.  But these models that like do the best that the clothes look the best, it is like a hanger.  They're like basically frail up here.  And it looks...  But clothes look...  All clothes look dope on them.  But there's only like a very small amount of chicks that you can work with. 
[03:20:30]  I think there's also a very different feeling that a woman has when she looks at another  woman than a man has when he looks at a woman as far as like what looks good and what doesn't  look good.  Yeah.  And there's a lot of things that girls do that other girls think look good.  Like there's certain ways that they'll dress or certain things that they'll buy, purses  and shit especially, that's really to impress other girls.  Like you cannot impress a guy with a purse.  But women are like really...  Some of them are like really into purses to impress each other with. 
[03:21:00]  Yeah.  Shoes.  I don't...  Like shoes, purses, jewelry, I know nothing.  I don't have that.  Like I'm missing that.  Good for you.  That's probably why you're funny.  I'm just like...  No.  It's...  I mean...  But I can be like, oh, that girl like looks great.  But I don't even aspire to try it because it seems so out of my range.  Um...  But I can look at a girl and be like, wow, she's beautiful.  But I'm not like, ooh, like let me...  I wonder what she looks like naked, you know, obviously because I'm not attracted to girls. 
[03:21:30]  I sound like I'm like defending myself.  But um...  But it's so weird to me.  But I understand it because I feel like when someone's really thin, like all the things  that we want to do naturally, like eat and fuck and everything, we like celebrate  people that are able to abstain the most from that, like, oh, like, like, oh God, she really  knows how to starve herself or um, like, yeah, like she's so, just, we sort of like celebrate  people just keeping themselves from biology. 
[03:22:00]  That's a big one for women too, right?  The, the ability to abstain, it's very, um, it's like, uh, it's a badge of courage or something.  It's like...  No, I can't do it.  It's an admirable...  There's nothing wrong...  Well, why should you?  It's out of my wheelhouse.  The idea that we're supposed to is so crazy.  The only problem with women is, of course, that there's too many guys that are pieces  of shit.  And men are more dangerous in their, physically, in the pieces of shit that you run into.  Yeah.  Whereas women are more dangerous maybe financially in the pieces of shit that you run into. 
[03:22:30]  What do you mean?  Well, you know, if a guy gets fucked over, usually guys get fucked over in a financial  way, um, like divorces or they get set up.  Like, I've seen, I've seen guys get set up and it's very disturbing.  I don't know any guy with any money.  Like, I seriously have never even dated a guy with, like, a dollar.  I've met, um, I've, I've met guys where I watched them go down.  I saw it happening.  They were not attractive.  They were uncomfortable with women.  And they had, all of a sudden, this really hot girl with them who, like, slowly but surely  stalks her way in this position and then bails with a ton of cash. 
[03:23:00]  But then how, like, isn't that transparent?  Don't these guys that are 80, aren't they, aren't they curious?  Like, why this beautiful Kate Upton lookalike, like, is in love with them?  It's because they're successful.  I'm suspicious of any guy who's better looking than me that wants to sleep with me.  I'm like, what, why?  Like, what do you think I can do for you?  Show you I'm not gay.  Don't you, but don't you wonder, and I know a lot of, I know, not a lot, but I know a handful  of women that had guys take their money.  Because I think women are even, even more susceptible to, like, just wanting that love 
[03:23:30]  and being like, sure, joint checking, I'll buy a house in our name.  Well, I don't think it's mutually exclusive.  I mean, you can get ripped off no matter what your sex is, whether, whether your sexual preference.  I'm sure gay guys rip each other off, and gay women rip each other off.  As a matter of fact, I know they do.  I'm so, like...  I know a gay woman who has to pay alimony.  My great-grandma was a bootlegger, and she was always, like, yeah, her liquor store is  still on 54th Street, Schumer's Liquors.  Wow.  54th Street where?  In between Park and Lex, or Madison. 
[03:24:00]  Yeah, it's right across from Monkey Bar.  That is fucking awesome.  Yeah.  What a great story.  Yeah, but she, um, she was always, she was just pounding it into my head, like, because  she, I think her husband tried to steal money from her, but she, like, put it away.  She's always like, save your money.  Good for her.  Yeah.  You know, it can happen.  I mean, you get, with the wrong person, the wrong guy, the wrong girl, whatever.  That can definitely happen.  I'm so sensitive to, like...  But I think, um, that happens more with men.  Men tend to be the ones who have more money in their relationships. 
[03:24:30]  Well, yeah, they make 70, what do they make, 70?  I don't know what it is.  But whatever it is, I'm not saying that women can't make money.  Don't jump down my throat.  I'm just...  No, I'm not.  I'm not saying you.  I'm saying people out there on the internet.  I wish that I've ever dated a guy and anything for me to steal.  Yeah.  I make a good amount of money now, you know?  Yeah, now it's tough.  No, it's weird, like, yeah, because guys are just like, eh, and I'm like, what?  You have to start dating athletes.  Oh, shit.  Pass.  Pass.  Black ones, too.  First of all, I cannot pretend to be interested... 
[03:25:00]  In what?  Basketball?  In any...  I like going to games, but I can't, like, I don't ever want to be, like, wearing a jersey  and being like, they're gonna...  I just don't want to do that.  Once they slip you that giant athlete dick...  Do you know I still haven't been with a black guy?  There you go.  Isn't that pathetic?  Like I said, once they slip you...  Right, maybe I'm scared I'll be under the trance.  Mm-hmm.  You will.  You'll be dancing.  You'll change.  Oh, my God.  You'll change.  You'll start wearing beads and shit.  I'll wear a jersey as a dress with a belt.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Big hoop earrings.  You go hardcore.  I'm on a VH1 reality show, like, fighting with other chicks. 
[03:25:30]  No, you'll avoid that.  You'll be fine.  I don't think so.  You're not gonna change your personality entirely.  No.  You're just gonna crave the black dick.  No.  You know, I had one encounter with a huge dick, and I talked about it on my last special.  I tapped out.  I was like, no way.  Why?  Well, maybe the dude didn't know how to use it.  He was assaulting you with it.  I mean, how many ways are there to use it?  Yes, and I don't know.  Don't you just go, like...  I don't even think about it.  Really?  I got one.  When it's that big, like, what are you supposed to do? 
[03:26:00]  You just have to, like...  Stretch out your vagina.  Yeah, I was like, I'm not...  We're not gonna have a life together.  I'm not gonna power through this.  Well, how about powering through?  How about you change your shape?  How about stretches out?  Just like when a woman has children, her breasts stretch out and then deflate.  Imagine?  No.  If you're having sex with that guy on a regular.  Plus, he's a super athlete.  He's probably constantly horny.  Oh, my God.  No.  Are athletes known as being more horny?  Oh, yeah, for sure.  Maybe I should do that.  Without a doubt.  For real?  Are you kidding me? 
[03:26:30]  Any...  Yeah, I would imagine.  I'm never in a relationship where it's like, I have the same sexual appetite as the guy  I'm dating.  It's either, like, they are, like, wanting it too much or it's me wanting it too much.  Like, it's...  I've never really had it even out.  Have you?  Yeah.  Yeah?  Where it's been like...  Yeah.  That's good.  That's encouraging.  Yeah, I mean, it definitely happens.  It's...  I think it's way harder for a chick.  I mean, I'm just guessing.  I know it is.  Obviously.  I think so, because it's...  But I don't know. 
[03:27:00]  If, like, if your girl is like, no, not tonight, does it, like, hurt your feelings?  Are you like, what's wrong with me?  Or you're just like, uh...  No.  Or someone...  Or someone...  Or she's tired.  Yeah.  Or doesn't want to, or whatever, you know?  Yeah, but also you've been...  You know, if you're with somebody for a long time, it's different.  I don't think there's any reason why, you know, two people can't figure out that they're  not sexually compatible.  And if you start dating each other, and you get to a point where you're, like, spending  a lot of time together, and then you hit those, that thing, like, I don't want... 
[03:27:30]  Look, I don't want it.  Yeah.  Like, whoa, okay.  We don't have to figure out what's important here, because there's a bunch of shit that's  important here.  The big important one is caring about each other and having a good time together.  That's the number one, right?  Yeah, being buddies.  That's number one.  Yeah.  But number two is you like to fuck each other.  And if you don't put it at number two, what are you putting at number two?  Yeah.  What is there?  What's number two?  No, I think you're right.  Financial security?  I mean, what is it?  Coexisting interests?  No.  I have almost nothing co-interest with my wife. 
[03:28:00]  There's not one thing that she likes, except a few TV shows and some art things and some...  But all of her hobbies, like, things that she enjoys, they're just her things.  And then, you know, we hang out and we have fun together.  Like, you don't have to have the same mutual desires or the same...  You cannot have to be into the same sports.  Like, I've actually heard guys say that they would never date a girl that doesn't watch sports.  Because the last thing you want is her complaining when you're watching sports.  Fuck that. 
[03:28:30]  She doesn't watch sports.  I don't want to date them.  Yeah.  I have a scene on my show tomorrow night about that.  Oh, really?  I swear I'm not trying to work it in.  That's awesome.  It's called Chick Who Can Hang.  And I just want to tell you about it.  But it's, yeah, it's guys sitting around.  They're like, I just want a girl.  Like, oh, this girl Joey.  She had, like, a lantern jaw.  And, like, you know, yeah.  Like, she does my fantasy pics.  And then you realize, like, they're just describing dudes.  Like, it's just, but, I mean, I know girls that are real into sports. 
[03:29:00]  But I'm not, but the difference is I don't care about sports at all.  But I'm not, like, and I don't want you to.  Like, I'm busy and I'm psyched to do my thing and I have my interests.  And, like, please do you.  I saw a tweet once where a girl said that girls who are into football get bigger diamonds.  I can't relate.  I saw those Twitter pictures and, like, a bunch of people, like, retweeted it.  And I think it was, like, a girl with, like, a sexy football outfit on or something, you know?  That's so awful.  And I feel like that's, like, the image of, that's, like, what girls see. 
[03:29:30]  And even, I've been going, because the NBA is, like, a big part of this movie that I'm going to do.  Oh, shit.  What did I say?  Amy gonna get some black dick for the first time.  Shit.  I don't even know if I was allowed to say that.  Oh, don't say it.  It didn't happen.  But anyway.  Nobody remembers on the internet.  But anyway, like, you know.  Just seeing these, uh, just seeing the way women are represented on TV, like, all these  real housewives, like, just no one's doing, even if they're like, oh, we had, like, this 
[03:30:00]  luncheon for charity, like, good, whatever, the thing that's getting edited and what we're  seeing is you guys being monsters.  And, like, this is, these shows, this is what girls are seeing.  Like, I don't have any, I have no jewelry.  Like, I don't know.  The girls that I'm close to, no one cares about a handbag.  Like, no one, no one gives a shit.  But that's not the girls that you see on television.  They're all comics.  Where are these girls?  They're all, like.  Oh, see, they're all, they might as well be dudes.  It's Rachel Feinstein, Nikki Glaser, you know.  Yeah, well, you're all a bunch of artists.  You're all trying to be comedians. 
[03:30:30]  If you, if a comic, like, all of a sudden became incredibly obsessed with keeping, like,  an upstanding or attractive appearance, that would, like, immediately preclude a lot of  the comedy.  Yeah.  You know, because you wouldn't, you wouldn't be relaxed at all.  You'd be, like, such a, you're, you're inciting, like, a look, a way of someone looking at  you, like, look at her with their bag.  Hmm, what a, that dress probably costs a lot of money.  I can't believe that people care about that stuff.  And it's not that I think I'm better than that.  It's honestly insane to me. 
[03:31:00]  Mm-hmm.  It's, it's insane to me that anybody would put value on, like, just, that's, it's so  transparent.  Like, look, this is expensive.  Like, I just, I think that's so crazy.  I think you're totally right, but let's play devil's advocate.  Yeah.  What if you are just really into beautifully crafted things, whether it's a watch, or whether  it's a car, or whether it's a purse, isn't it possible that it couldn't, that, I, I see  that a lot of people, I believe you're right, a lot of people, they're watching that stuff,  and they're looking at different people that have different things, and they, they want 
[03:31:30]  to show off.  Yeah.  They want to show everybody that they've got the purse that costs X, or the shoes that  cost Y, or, oh my God, look at the size of the rock she's got.  Right.  There are certainly people that want, do that.  But isn't it possible that there's other people that could just enjoy a beautiful purse,  or enjoy a beautiful home?  I also haven't, I haven't, like, seen that.  I don't know anyone with really expensive stuff.  So if someone was like, look at this watch, it costs 20 grand.  Like, I've never seen that.  And maybe I'd be like, wow, that's amazing.  I'm about comfort, and like, I like traveling. 
[03:32:00]  You know, I, like, my bed is expensive.  Like, I like, you know, things that sort of lend themselves to experience, but I haven't  seen, but you know what?  If you have so much money, and you're like, oh, I want to get this beautiful thing, I understand  that.  But I, I do know a lot of dudes that are, like, posting pictures of their possessions  they got.  On Instagram?  Yeah.  And I'm like, yeah, it makes me like, oh, come on.  Like, you don't have to do that.  Well, that, they, some dudes have to.  But why?  What does it, what does that mean?  Well, they don't have to, of course, they don't have to. 
[03:32:30]  But it's rappers.  It's like, rappers are like, I got this.  You know, and obviously, I actually love hip-hop, but that was the lyric I just went  to.  I've got this.  Like, I don't, that's obviously not what they say.  But it's, you know, it's like, a lot of it is like, about possessions.  About how much you have.  Yeah, showing your shit off.  Going on the Dub magazine cover with six cars.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Of course.  That's part of that culture.  So I think that's what, that's where that comes from.  And it's like, it's attached to just ego and just like alpha and stuff. 
[03:33:00]  Well, it's also a culture that's rebounding from periods of extreme, like slavery, extreme  poverty.  Like, there's generation after generation of negative things.  The racism, the riots, the civil rights movement.  Like, all those things are so recent.  It's hard for us to even wrap our heads.  I know.  It's so recent.  It's humiliating.  We're so white, too.  No.  You know, we don't, we don't feel it.  But I have friends that are half black, half white.  I have friends that are black.  I've seen the differences in how people react to them. 
[03:33:30]  And it's fascinating to watch.  Yeah.  You know, like big, dark black dudes get treated with fear everywhere they go.  It's hilarious.  That really is upsetting.  I, I, I never really paid that much attention to it because like a couple of my best friends  growing up were black.  Now they're white.  No, they, they were black.  And like, I never really thought about it until like going on auditions because the sign  in sheet would be like for the, whatever, Susan.  And I sign in and then it's like drug dealer.  And then it's just like these black guys are coming in.  They're like signing in. 
[03:34:00]  And I'm like, oh man, like this is just what, what society has done.  They're like, this is how we see you.  Like these guys were great actors.  It's like, these are, this is what.  Someone's got to play the drug dealer.  Wouldn't you want to be a great actor?  You want to be some real drug dealer?  What the fuck are you trying to say?  You liberal bitch.  No, we had a, this last season on the show, we had a guy, he was a mugger.  And in the scene it was called Skip Therapy.  And it's a really funny scene.  It's like, um, and Kyle Dunnigan, the comic is in it.  And, uh, and this guy like steals my bag and we needed it to be a stunt guy. 
[03:34:30]  And so, but, but I forgot that.  So the guy came, he was this great stunt guy.  His name's actually Muhammad Ali.  Well, that's his actual name?  It wasn't him, but that's his name.  And he came and I was like, I was like, we cast this black guy as the mugger.  Like, are we, are you serious?  They're like, no, like he's like really great at martial arts and stunts and stuff.  The best is when you have a white mugger that doesn't look like a mugger at all.  Yeah.  And you're like, oh, oh God.  I hate when shows do that.  Was that on Seinfeld?  Like there's some shows where they're like, the guy steals the purse.  And you're like, oh my God. 
[03:35:00]  Never has this guy even run before.  Yeah.  I'm sure.  Yeah.  I don't think we could ever even wrap our heads around what it would be like to be discriminated  against solely basic, you know, just completely based on the way you look and to have it feel  like that's insurmountable.  And then once you do make it and you, you know, but you get big, I could see all the,  the braggadocious behavior being like exubilant, exuberant.  Oh, I was thinking of that.  That's not a word.  I made it up.  Exubilant.  Sounds good though.  Jubilant and exuberant.  But what do you get?  People, people look at me, but just getting on stage, you know, just like my first, whatever, 
[03:35:30]  like 10 years, I feel like it was like, it's like, ugh, this bitch.  Like I look like I'm going to be a dumb bitch.  I know that.  You're so crazy.  You do not look dumb.  I look like I'm going to be a dumb bitch.  Yes, I do.  Are you saying dumb bitch meaning just a woman?  Or are you like a dumb white woman?  You think you'd look dumb?  I think I look like I've like, if I saw me in like a mall, I'd be like, ugh. 
[03:36:00]  So if you ever like.  Oh my God, that's so funny.  I mean, like, well, people have known who you are for so long, but do you, like, how  do people like.  I look like a meathead for sure.  Yeah, if I just like passed you, I'd be like.  But I have a lot of meathead tendencies.  It's like, it's a rational prejudice to think of me as a meathead.  I mean, I'm a fucking cage fighting commentator for God's sake.  Right.  And I am a dumb bitch. 
[03:36:30]  And I'm a dumb bitch too.  I consider myself a silly bitch.  Yeah.  But, I mean, there's, but the problem is that we have this idea that everyone's so  different and then these people that are so different can't be friends.  Like, I have friends that don't work out ever.  Yeah.  I mean, Brian is my friend.  Brian has like, just started working out for like four years he started working out.  And he smokes cigarettes constantly.  When did he stop?  He's totally unhealthy.  I mean, he just stops.  Like, he's not like, well, my point is, like, I'm not, like, it's not like I can't hang 
[03:37:00]  out with other people that don't fucking live weights and don't like to watch fighting.  Like, my friends are all different.  I don't even think of you like that.  I mean, like, I know you're in shape and whatever, but that's not, but I mean, I've  also spoken to you, but I don't know if I just like walk past you.  I don't, I think it's just, it's easy to pigeonhole people.  Yeah.  And I think there's a lot of us that are a combination of things.  And that's the people that are most fascinating to me.  When I meet someone and I think that they're, you know, I prejudge for whatever reason and  think, oh, this person's probably this.  And then it turns out that they're like a combination of things that I've never even 
[03:37:30]  met before.  Those are the greatest when you meet someone that doesn't fall in any category.  Yeah.  And you get to go, oh, I have misconceptions.  And then like this person is just a unique individual, completely on their own little  trip and cool to see.  And then that runs into your database and now your spectrum sort of broadens a little bit,  your ideas.  Because that's one of the things that I think one of the reasons why people get in like  so many shit relationships, because their spectrum is like super narrow.  They've only had like a narrow band of people and the type of experiences have been like 
[03:38:00]  really similar and negative over and over again.  But other than it just being a specific like type, you know, socioeconomic, that kind of  stuff.  Don't you think it's just like those patterns that were set up just real early on, just from  young shit?  It definitely can be for sure.  You also get it from your parents, I think, plus and minus.  I think some people see their parents involved in like really negative relationships and  they completely change their gears and they just reject it like from the jump. 
[03:38:30]  And then they don't take any shit from anybody.  They don't let anybody fucking turn them into a doormat.  Totally.  It's either or.  Yeah.  It's either or sometimes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I do that.  I do the, um, I do the former.  Yeah.  Of course.  That's where you're coming.  I'm like, oh my God, you can't give me the love I need and you're a narcissist.  I'm like, come here, come here, come here.  I'm like.  Yeah.  Comics.  That's, that's part of the whole reason why we became comics is because we had a hole.  Yeah.  They were trying to shove some funny in there and stuff up that hole. 
[03:39:00]  Yep.  And anybody who doesn't have that hole, guess what?  Guess what?  You're not funny.  Fuck you.  Go run 90 marathons.  I'm just kidding.  I'm just kidding.  I respect what you did, Eddie.  Yeah.  I think it was only 46 too.  Plus I give him more credit than he's doing.  I mean, anybody can do 46.  Oh my God.  Yeah.  I think you can't, you can't be a comic unless you're unbalanced.  Yeah.  But I think somewhere along the line, you can be balanced.  At least I like to believe so.  That you can balance it out.  You can?  Yeah.  You can right the ship. 
[03:39:30]  You just got to figure out like, what is, what are your needs?  Like, as far as like your psychological needs and how do you meet those?  How do you, how do you maintain a good psychological existence?  Yeah.  I feel like I'm getting healthier.  Yeah.  I hope.  But I, I feel like that because you're more successful.  So you're more relaxed too.  That's got to benefit you a bit.  Um, I'm, I am more relaxed, but I don't, but it's just, yeah, I'm just like less stressed  by some things, but I, I am having like sort of more pressure on me, but I think it's  just like showbiz pressure.  Yeah.  But I think it's just like taking a step back and keeping the people close to you that will 
[03:40:00]  tell you like that was stupid or like you look like dog shit, just people who keep  it real.  So I've like people I trust, um, and you keep it real for yourself too.  I mean, you can tell you're constantly questioning things.  And do you worry about that though?  Cause that is an issue with a lot of people.  People worry about becoming famous and then also going cuckoo.  Cause we've kind of seen it.  Yeah, definitely.  I, I've, I do worry about, cause I, you get so like every day I feel like you, somebody 
[03:40:30]  like slaps you in the face.  I, the way I started going out on the road was on the last comic standing tour and we  had to do meet and greets after every show.  And sometimes it was like an arena, it would be like 3000 people, however many would wait.  And they voted for some people.  So someone come over to me and be like, my husband likes you, but I know.  So I just like got used to, and it was like 40 cities or something.  And I just got used to like this defense that's just like built into me now.  So I'm like, I've been like trying to break down, forget my childhood insecurities.  Like what happened just the first times I went out on the road. 
[03:41:00]  So I'm afraid my defenses got so built up that I had to really like break them down so  that I could sort of let the right ones in.  But I am afraid that my defenses will get too strong because you'll see like really famous  people that are like your idols or comics you love and you meet them and they're so  disappointing because they're so withholding.  And it's like, you're like, yeah, it's probably because they've been wronged by so many  interactions, but you still can't let that happen to you.  You know, and so that is something that I am aware of and I don't want to let happen 
[03:41:30]  to me because I am, I am like, you know, afraid of, of somebody saying something or  like hurting me or trying to take too much.  And you know what I think about it with Louis, Louis CK, when I, when I first was  interacting with him, he was like kind of standoffish with me and, uh, and he should  have been because I'm sure, I'm sure I wanted something from him, you know, just being a  newer comic, you see someone and you know, at the clubs, like they, like there's like, 
[03:42:00]  you just have this urgency as a comic, like, and you don't know what to do.  Like no one can tell you this is what you do to be a better comic.  This is what you do to get work.  Even if they tell you just get on stage as much as possible, you can't hear it.  So Louis being so like sort of guarded with me, he should have been.  And now like we have a very nice rapport and it's always good to see him and we talk and  I, and I kind of like resented him a little bit for being, being cold to me at first,  but I'm like, he, but I'm like, he should have been because I'm sure I didn't even know 
[03:42:30]  what I wanted from him, but I'm sure I wanted something from him.  So I get it.  But, but also like you were saying before we're on the air, like just, you know, somebody,  people project stuff onto you if they have like an interaction that's less than satisfactory,  but it's not about you.  Like you can't change how anybody feels about you.  So, but I'm whatever, my long rant, my point is just like, I'm trying not to become an asshole  and to give people the benefit of the doubt.  At least like I'll go into every interaction, like hi.  And then if they say something to me that shuts me down, then that's, you know, 
[03:43:00]  at least I went into it open.  Right.  I feel what you're saying.  And I, I, I think that that concern is a good thing to have.  And it's cool that you're thinking like that because we all need to learn from the people  that we've seen that have disappointed us.  Yeah.  Yeah.  People that we've seen that, you know, just for whatever reason, someone became a prick  because they became famous.  Yeah.  That's happened to a lot of comedians.  I've seen it.  I've seen it.  And they stopped being funny too.  There's another weird thing that happens. 
[03:43:30]  They get a little too famous, too much adulation.  Too much, you know, they have a sitcom or something like that.  And then, or they want, they want credit for like their new art they're doing.  Like, look, I know I was funny at one point, but now I play the standing base.  And like, if you want to come see me, that's what you're going to get.  And it's like, who does that?  Well, I'm not, I mean, like, it's not the standing base, but I'm just saying, I think,  cause I, I even will have those impulses.  Like, I don't want to be funny right now.  Just, and, and, you know, but you're like, and then, but then I'm like, bitch, that's 
[03:44:00]  how people know you.  But wait a minute, wait a minute, wait, why don't, you need a podcast.  That's what you need.  You always say that to me.  Amy Schumer, you need a goddamn podcast because you could, first of all, you're really good  at it.  You're very smart.  You're very articulate.  You'd be fancy, fascinating at breaking things down, but all those misconceptions would  go away.  If people got to listen to you talk, then you wouldn't worry about if people knew you  cause you, you would put it out there so many times that would be like real clear, but 
[03:44:30]  I'm not that worried about if people know me.  Right.  But well, okay.  I see your point, but you're not really worried that people know you, but your interactions,  like you're worried about your interactions with people.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah.  You just want to make sure that they're as good as possible.  I want to like know that I did my, my best and that I was open, having a nice interaction  and, and, and making small talk and whatever.  Um, uh, I don't, I don't know what I was saying. 
[03:45:00]  But you know, we're talking about like you, you were saying you worry about getting detached.  You worry about becoming one of those people that's kind of, that gets goofy.  Yes.  One of the best ways to avoid that.  Oh, you think having a podcast keeps you like grounded?  100%.  Cause you get feedback all the time.  Yeah.  You constantly get updated and checked and you constantly get.  But, but, but what, what, what's the feedback good for?  I mean, and I'm on Twitter.  I'm sorry.  I know I'm on Twitter and I do think you're right though.  But, but then I like, I don't think it's good to reinforce positive, negative feedback.  Like someone will, you know, write, you know, like you're disgusting. 
[03:45:30]  And then you look and it's like, oh, they write to famous people all day.  You just block them.  You don't have to interact with them.  Right.  You just block them.  I just like, I would never reward like that.  Well, you don't, that's what I'm talking about.  I mean, sometimes people will have valid opinions about what you're doing.  Whether it's standup or whether it's a podcast or whether it's the fucking upright tuba or  whatever you're doing, everybody, whatever it is, everybody has, you know, they're going  to have opinions.  You're going to have opinions on everything you do. 
[03:46:00]  Yeah.  But some, sometimes having those opinions, like if, if they're mostly swinging to the  right side, they're mostly swinging to the good side.  It gives you sort of a frequency that you're, you, you know, that they appreciate it.  You like tapped into this thing.  Like people love the Amy Schumer show.  Boom.  Inside Amy Schumer on Comedy Central.  Now Amy has a blog.  You know, Hey, watch Amy do videos.  I'm going to go do laundry.  You know, like you, you're, you tap into, you tap into a certain vibe when you get a 
[03:46:30]  certain amount of feedback.  Like, yeah, I, and I, I feel like as a comic, you know, there's that urge to communicate,  which I have, but then there's also, I think also as a girl, as a bunch of things and I,  and I talk like very openly and then some of that feedback, it makes you like, Oh, should  I not be sharing this much of myself?  Because, but then you're like, I'm like, no, I've made a decision.  Like I'm going to live my life this way and try and make people laugh and maybe feel 
[03:47:00]  better, but then like that sometimes that's met with where you're like, is it worth it?  Cause this is so hard sometimes.  And, and I'm not just like scared of somebody saying something mean to me.  Like it's also people not respecting your boundaries and, and it is, you know, it's,  it's like a struggle and it is like, you know, I, I do have to like kind of work and be aware  of not becoming like real standoffish.  Right.  Well, you're, you're not really capable of filtering who knows you once you become famous. 
[03:47:30]  And that's a big difference between that and just being an ordinary person going about your  day, especially an ordinary woman going about your day, because so many men like with women  take on an aggressive approach.  It's almost like it's, it's almost commonplace, right?  The guy just aggressively comes up to girls and hits on them.  Women are just as aggressive.  I find sometimes, but it doesn't come with the physical threat.  It feels like with a man, like if a chick's aggressive with me, I'm always like, Oh, okay. 
[03:48:00]  It's a crazy bitch.  I got to get out of here.  But I don't, I'll go, Oh my God.  What if she follows me to my car?  That is true.  There is, there is the added fun bonus of like, Oh, this guy might try and might try to rape  you.  But yeah, I mean, that's less fearful with when you're a man.  I mean, you're always worried about someone doing something to you.  To be honest with you, it's a real bummer to know that you could be sexually assaulted.  I couldn't even, I mean, I can imagine, but I couldn't, you know, it's like I couldn't 
[03:48:30]  imagine.  I also couldn't imagine being pregnant.  There's a lot of things I could pretend to imagine, but I really can't imagine them.  I can't imagine not drinking for nine months.  I'm like, wow, that's my Eddie is a marathon.  I'm like, what?  I'm like, can you just have a press conference?  I have a couple of questions.  You know, people drank while they were pregnant for years and some of the greatest people that  were ever created were created by people who drank.  My mom always says that she drank through all four pregnancies, but I only have two siblings. 
[03:49:00]  No, I'm just kidding.  Well, I think you're allowed to have a little wine.  I think like a small glass of wine is actually good for your body and it relaxes you.  Right, but I hear that and then I would be like, hmm, how about a bottle?  This baby wants an Ambien.  This baby wants to get fucking fucked up.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm probably barren.  I don't even know what I'm talking about.  I bet you're not.  Find one of them black athletes when you're doing that show.  No way.  Get some of that super sperm.  I can't. 
[03:49:30]  Squirt.  You'll have twins before you even know it.  Like, oh my God.  What if I went from, what if a year from now I come back and I'm like, I've got twins.  I've got little half black babies.  And you're like, the crazy thing is all I did was jerk him off.  It's nuts.  He came all over my tits the next thing I know I was pregnant.  I mean, I was adamant.  I don't want kids.  I take you to court for alimony.  They fucking ran.  You don't need any money.  They ran through the lines in your crotch like fire ants. 
[03:50:00]  Oh my God.  The sperm just, they're different.  They move.  They swim.  They swim on land.  They're fucking flopping around.  This is the beginning of an ad for Onnit.  Yeah.  They're flopping around like those fish, those snake fish that come out.  What are those snake head fish that come out of water and they walk on the land until  they find some new water?  Ursula from The Little Mermaid?  No, a real fish.  Oh, sorry.  God damn it.  A real fish.  Have you ever seen that?  I saw the movie Piranha in 3D.  Did you really?  I didn't know it was going to be 3D, so I was like so psyched.  When they gave us the glasses, I was like, what? 
[03:50:30]  It was like one of the best surprises of my whole life.  I used to have piranhas, allegedly.  What?  Yeah.  I had a bunch of them.  I used to feed them goldfish, allegedly.  This is all fiction.  Is it illegal to have?  Yes.  Really?  This was many decades ago.  Why?  Why is it illegal?  Because they're dangerous or what?  Yeah.  You could send them into, if you were an asshole, you could put them in a lake somewhere and  they'd go in the non-native waters and they would wreak havoc.  And that's happened to a bunch of different fish species.  I think the snake head was one of them, actually. 
[03:51:00]  If it's not the snake head, it's a different fish.  There's a walking fish.  Is that it?  Ew.  Oh, my God.  I don't need something else to be scared of.  We were just talking about rape.  People threw them.  Some people threw these fish in the pond that's in Central Park because they thought it was  funny.  And so now these things are living in the pond and just destroying everything.  No.  When I was there, I saw some fish, some big giant fish attack something else in the water.  Just this big froth of water.  And then whatever had happened, happened. 
[03:51:30]  In what water was it?  There's a pond in Central Park.  Yeah.  You know that big pond?  Yeah.  In that water, there's some crazy-ass fish.  This is in Central Park.  See, this is, yeah, monster fish in Central Park.  Does it attack anything or can you just see it?  Yeah, you can't see much of it.  Oh, that's it right there.  You barely can see it.  Yeah, that's a snake head fish.  Somebody just put it in that pond.  Those things eat ducks.  They'll eat anything.  Oh, my God.  They're, like, super hardy, too.  Like, once you get them in an ecosystem, you have to essentially kill everything in that 
[03:52:00]  lake to get them all out.  What do they do?  They just fish?  They just wreak havoc, eat everything, and then become cannibals.  Ew.  Oh, like, I'm already so afraid all the time.  It says, if you see this fish, see a terrifying fish with teeth in Central Park, kill it immediately.  It's too late.  The problem is these things are just shooting out eggs and sperm and breeding like crazy.  This is like Predator.  Like, remember that movie Predator?  Yeah.  Like, if Predator landed and just started killing all the people. 
[03:52:30]  That's what it's like for that thing.  Like, that thing going into the pond in Central Park, it's like, woo-hoo, let the party begin.  That is such a bummer.  There's lions.  A lion just got led into the fucking zebra cage at the zoo.  That's what it's like.  Oh, I was like, that happened?  Well, it could happen.  That's what's happening with this fish.  It's just, that's what it's like.  A super Predator just got introduced into this humble ecosystem.  That's really depressing.  We're about to film on that pond.  Well, you might watch murder behind you.  Fish murder.  Nah!  Oh, my God.  But the fish is like the worst thing you could ever see for a creationist. 
[03:53:00]  The fish walking on the ground and walking to the next pond.  Because if you're a creationist and you see that, you go,  Yeah, but, I mean, don't creationists do that all day, looking at everything?  Yes.  With denial.  Yeah.  Yeah, but this is one of the most preposterous things ever.  Have you ever seen, you've never seen one of these things walk?  No, I'm so grossed out.  Pull that out.  Just by seeing its mouth.  Fish walks.  Every time I come here, I leave upset because of the videos.  There's a documentary from the Congo. 
[03:53:30]  The guy that got fucked by the horse.  Did I show you that?  Yes.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  This is nothing nearly as disturbing.  But there's a video in the Congo where, I think it's prehistoric fish eaten by dinosaur bird.  That's what it says.  There's this crazy bird called a shoebill.  And the shoebill is like five feet tall with an enormous beak.  Its beak is like a giant hatchet.  Yeah.  Its beak is literally like an axe on its face. 
[03:54:00]  It's a huge beak.  And this bird is something out of another era.  There used to be birds like that that were like seven feet tall that lived in North America.  And they don't fly.  They just sort of run around and attack things.  They're predatory birds.  Then why is it a bird?  Like a penguin.  Oh yeah, penguins don't fly and they're like, look, we're birds.  Yeah, we're birds, bitch.  Please do not fuck with us.  Did you see that dinosaur 3D movie that's available right now on Netflix?  I did not see it.  It's really worth it.  This is a different thing.  Yeah. 
[03:54:30]  This is not the dinosaur movie.  It's called Donald Sutherland.  That's the dad.  He narrates it and it's like, it's really good.  I obviously am psyched by 3D.  Oh, so it's a recreation of like what they looked like?  Yeah.  And they like come at your head.  Modern Jurassic Park style?  Yeah.  And it ends like spoiler with a big evolving bird that's like so awesome.  Ostrich is another good example of a bird that doesn't really fly, right?  They don't fly.  They don't do shit.  They'll fuck you up.  They'll kick the shit out of you.  This has been the Joe Rogan experience.
