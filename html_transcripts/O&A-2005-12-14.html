<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a segment heavily focused on a compilation of clips featuring prominent media figures like Jimmy "The Greek" Snyder, Howard Cosell, and Wolf Blitzer, making racially insensitive and offensive remarks.  The hosts and callers dissected these clips, debating the context and impact of the statements, which included the use of racial slurs and offensive stereotypes.  The controversial Willie Lynch theory was also discussed.  Colin Cosell, Howard Cosell's grandson, called in to offer his perspective.  Listener calls contributed further examples of on-air racial gaffes, including comments by Celine Dion about Hurricane Katrina victims, and the discussion also included numerous jokes about midgets.  The segment concluded with continued analysis of various controversial on-air racial remarks and blunders.

The show then transitioned to crude jokes about precocious puberty and hormone-injected chickens, followed by crass remarks about a Peruvian girl, Milagros Serron, with "mermaid syndrome," and her successful leg separation surgery.  A caller, Scott, shared a story about discovering radioactive waste during a demolition, interrupted by an irrelevant question from another caller, Joey.  A bit featuring "the Greece Man," known for racist remarks, was played, including the use of numerous offensive ethnic and racial slurs within a fictional "Greeceola Crayons" context.

The hosts then discussed Serious Satellite Radio's stock performance, Opie's ownership of Serious stock, and Anthony's skepticism about Howard Stern's success on the platform, criticizing Stern's content and comparing it unfavorably to their own show, while expressing disdain for Bubba the Love Sponge.  A listener called to discuss a negative article about Stern, leading to further criticisms of Stern's perceived phoniness.  The hosts contrasted their own show's success and approach with Stern's.  A listener call detailed plans for a large gathering of "pests" (Opie and Anthony fans) to disrupt Stern's farewell.

The show featured a studio interview with David Draiman of Disturbed.  The conversation covered Disturbed's music, their covers of Genesis' "Land of Confusion" and Tears for Fears' "Shout," and Draiman's personal experiences.  He discussed the band's evolution,  live shows, and their large underground following. The interview included listener calls, some sharing fan anecdotes, others mentioning a Kiss tribute band member who set his house on fire.  A Richard Cheese lounge cover of "Down with the Sickness" was played. The conversation also touched on Draiman's political views (including his criticism of George W. Bush), experiences with neo-Nazis, personal life, and views on the term "dropping plates."  The hosts and Draiman used racial slurs, including the n-word, throughout the interview.  Draiman's security guard was present in the studio. The segment concluded with a giveaway for Disturbed concert tickets and the playing of "Just Stop."

A studio interview with Calvin, CEO of Bodog, followed.  He discussed Bodog's online gambling offerings, including horse racing, casino games, and the launch of Bodog Poker 2.0.  He also promoted a Bodog charity poker event and rock concert.  The conversation shifted to Opie and Anthony's "Wow" stickers and merchandise, with Patrice O'Neal co-hosting.  A significant portion involved playing and discussing a listener-submitted "loudest orgasm ever," compared to a Tom Sizemore sex tape clip, with graphic descriptions and humorous speculation from the hosts and Patrice.  A Utah listener called with fluctuating opinions on Patrice, followed by a call from Steve describing a sexual encounter video.  The segment concluded with a call from Pepper of Corrosion of Conformity discussing the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina and promoting an upcoming appearance at J&R Music and Computer World.

[00:06:30]  THE END  THE END  THE END  THE END  THE END  THE END OVzers  You got to know  that by now  vedo  we've been looking for the the E'ing the Greek clip from se√±or  The EWVER, END  yeah  what was it?  he was at some kind of function and he had a drink  he was just sitting down at a 
[00:07:00]  tuvac beard  sitting down at a table dinner dinner yeah having a few drinks camera in his face microphone and i  don't know how that conversation got rolling i guess they were talking about uh probably some  sports figure and uh he fell into that little train of thought absolutely the truth though  never understood why he got five on it yeah it's there are some truths that are unspoken  you just can't say it it was just the truth it was just like you know they bred big black niggas 
[00:07:30]  with big black niggas to make big black babies they didn't want some skinny weakling that's what  that's what they did and then is that why black is a better athlete maybe white people was upset  that they said black was a better athlete yeah maybe that was it puts the white man off the reason  they are is exactly what that was just what jimmy the creek said but back in the day i don't think  you could say that stuff can't say it now i think he would have got away with it today  no way absolutely not he would have got uh fucking not only fired he would have kept 
[00:08:00]  getting rehired so that they could keep firing well that's well that's that's what i mean that  would be the difference you're right he would do his time and then he'd be back on tv just  crucified oh it would be much worse that was back during fucking all in the family when he said  that was back in the howard cosell days look at that little monkey scamper i call a lot of people  little monkeys that was his excuse look at that can we find that clip too the howard cosell clip 
[00:08:30]  that's a great one i can't i'm not sure that was racist like sometimes i really want to say  everything white people do is racist just to say it right but you know context is people who don't  understand context i tend to believe women just don't understand context yeah just the word is  the word and like oh doesn't matter where it is but what it's being used for right just but  look at that little monkey it just was something that popped in his dummy i'm sure he was late in 
[00:09:00]  races but he was an old jew how racist could he be but i'm sure he didn't he was probably pissed  because it's like my god i wasn't trying to be racist if i was trying you'd have known it  you know look at that little cooner right exactly and it piss you off when you get accused of doing  something that you didn't that you do you've done it before you do it you get accused of it when you  weren't doing it like wait a minute no no let me give you an example when i did do that 
[00:09:30]  he's running like he thinks he's free from slavery look at him running look at that ashy negro run his  little black cheeks off he's running like the chains just came off look at him go  so you just want to be i don't think that jimmy is that stupid he wanted to have a job he was just  trying to be candid and a little it's like hey it is what it is this is why i think it's just the 
[00:10:00]  whole equating the black man to an animal type thing because if you had the same conversation  about thoroughbred racehorses if you got this little weakling thoroughbred horse that came out  yeah you're not going to use it to breed with another thoroughbred to make the strongest racehorse  uh you can't and uh with the civil war the guy's talking about civil war days not fucking what's  going on you know at the time he said this then he said that but the plantation owners  wanted strong workers so why would they breed uh when they had power to do this 
[00:10:30]  some weak black guy with uh a black woman is what they did is like you can't say it you can't say  they really just picked two big mothers out and said go fuck well it's a whole plan if you one day  why you why you um you know taking breaks off of being racist just look at the uh what they call  the uh the willie lynch papers willie lynch the willie lynch theory it's a it's it's supposedly 
[00:11:00]  quote-unquote urban legend but it's not urban legend it was the plan on how to design slavery because  to how to keep black people enslaving themselves is the plan oh really yeah and it's based on  how horse breeding really is based on what's strange i brought that up it is all right listen  that is strange i've never heard of that yet i use the horse analogy look at obi's like look at obi's  just like jimmy the green girl no no no no listen everybody not at all i'm gonna bring this to the 
[00:11:30]  next level oh you're gonna bring the people in i'm bringing the trucker in nebraska fuck no no  it wasn't based on horses stupid it's based on ducks and dogs you have to have faith in my in me  sometimes patrice all right watch what i do right now oh jesus we got howard cassell's son uh nephew  uh somebody relates to howard cassell's son wait i always forget grandson that's right we have  howard cassell's grandson he calls the show every once in a while really for real i swear to god this

[00:20:00]  yeah we got the wolf blitzer too oh where's the wolf blitzer huh he didn't get in trouble for that  no because they were so poor and so black i mean there really ain't yeah we got we got all this we  got a lot of this stuff we gotta start playing it now oh my god eric's trying to find that for us  yeah wolf blitzer uh during uh katrina oh he's talking with one of the reporters and of course  he's back in uh uh cnn central there the situation room he's got all those cameras uh all those video 
[00:20:30]  screens behind him and uh he's trying to be a little profound i guess and he goes and these people you  watch the heartbreaking video of them being evacuated from the rooftops and and uh not no food or water  and they are so poor and they are so black wow if he didn't if he didn't if you didn't see him trying  to muster up that that emotion like if he just goes on and just struggling and just ah what difference 
[00:21:00]  does it make yeah okay when you look at all you see are a sea of black faces wet niggas what are you  gonna do we have another one turtle head hey good morning fellas good morning hey don't forget uh  i don't know patrice ever heard it um martin luther kunday oh that was a weather guy yeah do we have  that one he got fired man oh my god he got fired before they went to sports right after the weather 
[00:21:30]  i mean fraud in right away ass yeah hole because he was saying he was saying uh martin luther king day  and he said martin like he slipped up before he even got the king so king came out like coon and  and it didn't even all the way come out it was like martin luther coot king like oh no oh no he  was gonna say cold front or i don't know he got always thinking he got all messed up like it but 
[00:22:00]  roydian yeah it didn't seem like with his buddies he could say that all the time and then it came out  when he yeah here's what i decree here's the decree we make right now before when any white guy does  something like that you you you the black community gets to vote on whether he gets fired or not yeah  but that's an instant fired it's not because the black community gets to vote you know what who black  people didn't give a shit about was rush limbaugh saying that uh uh uh remember you were talking about 
[00:22:30]  uh uh with some quarterback for philly um all right yeah he goes they want to you know he's a  he's a black quarterback he stinks he goes he sucks but they're pumping him up because you need a  black quarterback to be good he got some heat for that he got he got fired for that for me for espn  he got fired oh from espn yeah but i'm not positively sure that he's not that it was russ limbaugh  himself is is you know what he is but it's like i don't know if that's a racist comment to go out 
[00:23:00]  you know i don't know i'm not sure if the nfl doesn't need black quarterbacks they might need  them because it was a stigma all that time so it's like i'm not sure russia be i'm not sure in that  situation though unless you have the piece of paper from the nfl higher-ups that said we really need a  lot more black quarterbacks so you could show it and go see i was just saying that if you're speculating  like he was like that then it can be that's dangerous as being racism and and uh out you go  we got the wolf blitzer clip ah here's wolf as much as you see that picture though you you simply get 
[00:23:30]  chills every time you see these poor individuals as jack capperty just pointed out so tragically so  many of these people almost all of them that we see are so poor and they are so black and this is  going to raise lots of questions for people who are watching this story unfold we'll take a quick  break more of our special coverage yeah we'll take a quick break all right i absolutely know where he 
[00:24:00]  was going with that he just fucked up uh he i really think he meant to say they're so poor and so many of  them are black right like that's what he meant it's not like they're so black like look at that  mother fucker you can't see him it's fucking dusk and already i can't see the mother fucker you  know uh how many homicidism dopes did you think you all throughout the the producers and all the  yeah so poor and so black so black oh holy shit oh damn well go to commercials we'll be right back 
[00:24:30]  after this uh but what do you say about the rednecks like in the tornado it's like there's no that's  see that's the thing that keeps us from apart is that you give white people so much credit for  being able to like affect your life with their little statements but it's like you know oh look  at the poor white people oh look at them they're they're just so they shouldn't be in this position  because they're white because they're white it should be black folks blowing away oh i don't like 
[00:25:00]  you know you when you see large groups of white people carrying babies and food over their back  and stuff you're like why are they in that position why the fuck why but then katrina you see just like  huge uh groups of black people walking around babies and uh groceries and everything whatever  they can carry and you're like oh well you know they're poor down there they should have known to  fucking leave and the water came in that's why they're trapped on the rooftop they don't fucking 
[00:25:30]  listen to the goddamn news what the fuck they'll listen to their hip-hop music they ain't got no  maybe if they turn the hip-hop off every once in a while and put on a fucking news station they  had known this shit was coming turn on b-e-t put on a little cnn i'm sure yeah b-e-t didn't have  the fucking map with the hurricane going it's coming your way they thought it was a new video  katrina hits oh shit katrina hitting katrina dropping where's katrina dropping is she opening 
[00:26:00]  up for beyonce oh man let's go to georgia eric what's up hey you guys uh the the sports stuff is  hilarious but uh about two years ago this running back from i think it was either virginia or virginia  tech he made some like ridiculous 95 yard run or something and after the game the uh sports one of  the sports reporters was asking him you know what was he thinking about uh when he was doing the  run and he was like to be honest with you i just pretended i was being chased by the cops 
[00:26:30]  that's funny and he was a black kid and it was just like the reporter sat there like he uh  uh there's nothing better than watching the reporters in an uncomfortable situation like  that because i've seen anchor people where somebody maybe the sports guy because it's always  the sports guy or the weather guy just say something fucking stupid like the anchors usually  have it together enough to know that their career like they can fuck it up by by saying something 
[00:27:00]  stupid sports and weather guys they want to get their little moment in there so sometimes they  really fuck up and say something not even overtly racist but just enough to make the anchors so  uncomfortable that they won't even comment on it or acknowledge he said it or anything so later on in  the management meeting they could go well look at the tape i didn't even hear it i'm just shuffling  my paper we'll be back with our top stories after we got this idiot away from my desk 
[00:27:30]  i love it all right we can't find martin uh luther coon oh what about uh joe uh line one from denver  i remember this one all right let's go to denver joe hey what about when tiger woods won the uh  his first oh yeah yeah fuzzy zeller yeah you get to pick the menu for the next year and fuzzy says  well i guess next year we're having fried chicken and watermelon oh god but see black people this is 
[00:28:00]  this is a war between white people black people really think some of that shit is hilarious it's  just that we gotta we gotta keep you motherfuckers in check when you just say goofy  shit like that right but it's hilarious we would say that to each other right right right we trash  tiger woods black people trash tiger woods ever since he goes i'm cobbled asian and it's just like  mother you're a nigger you gooky nigger you ain't no cobbler fucking asian motherfucker cobbler  asian how is that cobbler i'm cobbled asian i'm half the shut the up goddamn porsche bucket you 
[00:28:30]  are a nigger and that's how you're gonna get treated didn't fuzzy wuzzy let you know that  fuzzy let you know that and fuzzy's defense was no we say this shit all the time all the time and  they do in the locker room they do you know they fuck with that half a black asian you know they  mess with tiger's head like that and you know something he gets them back tenfold by kicking  their fucking asses out there on the court if you guys got some of these clips send them into the  show because we don't have all of them unfortunately we got to scrape these up find uh tax cunts by 
[00:29:00]  the way oh we did yeah i mean i it's sort of in the same category but yeah yeah yeah news people  fucking up miss uh miss speaking miss here's uh tom brokaw doing some kind of uh special he was  standing on a runway right next to an airplane or something this is one of our favorites and uh  he was meant to say the uh presidential uh tax cuts and he's got such a bad speech impediment  this guy uh obviously everyone knows he's just retired recently but had a long illustrious career 
[00:29:30]  as an anchorman for nbc nightly news could not speak he had one of those lisps where you can't  say your l words it calls out like all just this compression between the back of the tongue that's  up your mouth so you sit there nbc nightly news i'm tom brokaw today's top story leon klinghoffer  pushed off the deck of the achilles i couldn't say it i saw that clip years ago of him saying that  and was like this motherfucker can't talk he's the top dog at the news organization and he can't say 
[00:30:00]  an l all right and here he is uh screwing up uh tax cuts listen to the little uh gap right after he  said it when he knew he fucked up but if the gap was any longer he knew people would know he  fucked up so he trudges on like a pro the key component and what the president insists is a job  stimulus program ohio a strong republican state is hurting economically and as nbc david gregory 
[00:30:30]  reports tonight the president took his message right to a powerful ohio republican who is not convinced  the tax cuts the tax cuts are the answer the tax cuts that long space sounded like 20 years didn't  it oh yeah tax cuts and to watch the video it's a flash that comes over his face doesn't last more  than a quarter of a second but you see it he panics his eyes get a little wider that delay and then goes 
[00:31:00]  right back into it and he proed his way through it like oh because it was live you know it was  fucking live man i think the best way to do it is is to just pretend you did not know if you say  like so poor so black you just but that but see wolf did a good job that's what wolf blitz again that's  that that thing where emotions for an emotionalist kind of person yeah comes in and he's feeling  emotional and he fucks up his entire rhythm because usually he's just disconnected so poor and so many  people are black and it's you know i don't this is just a tragedy right yeah but it's just so poor 
[00:31:30]  so black so black oh i so fucked that lineup oh so wet and so crispy so nappy-headed like  just fucking no one nothing beats the kayaks though with celine dion oh celine just losing her mind  when you hear the kayak one no this is got shit to play for you when the victims of katrina are on 
[00:32:00]  tv and it was 24 hours a day i mean everyone watched it and and all the celebrities had to get involved  sean penn down in the boat with his shotgun and helping people uh get out and celine dion on larry king  starts talking gets very emotional about uh this whole thing and just babbles like an idiot like the  idiot she is she is mentally retarded with a vegas show that's what it is a retard with a vegas show 
[00:32:30]  yeah before the kayak one listen to this you know some people are stealing and they're making a big  deal out of it oh they're stealing 20 pair of jeans or they're stealing television sets who cares they're  not going to go too far with it maybe those people are so poor some of the people who do that they're  so poor they've never touched anything in their lives let them touch those things for once  all right all right only a fucking mongoloid retard would even have a thought process like that 
[00:33:00]  that they're not stealing oh you can touch this plasma tv but you can't have it that's because she  doesn't have a history of having an emotion right then the emotional thing to say is man who gives a  fuck about those televisions yeah and just who cares and ended but and she but she's trying to be so  profound in her new emotion that she's discovered need to touch it no no look celine let me clue you  in they don't just want to touch it they want to take it as many as they can keep them bone

[01:07:30]  they had a lot of midgets uh no in lovejoy they didn't find it it was uh just outside of lovejoy  uh more of uh east buffalo south buffalo area they found more of that uh uh nuclear waste crap  they found some nuclear shit so that this town just evacuated and it just sits there to this day  they didn't know i i heard that shit although i heard they made into very cheap housing and people  are buying up those houses now but when i was up there if you would drive through these neighborhoods it  was creepy as hell man there was like grass growing through the sidewalk now you know all 
[01:08:00]  the houses unkept obviously kids toys in the driveway still i mean people just took their  shit and left and this town just sat there like a ghost town for many many years creepy they ain't  getting any better that's for sure and and the roads you know a little like almost little trees  not you know we're growing through them now and uh it was it was unbelievable to check out man they  would dump shit that would just make ghost towns out of places years ago they had no clue like uh  there was there was a factory that made watches and uh they made glow-in-the-dark numbers but they 
[01:08:30]  were hand-painted so there were all these women that would sit around with these little paint brushes  and dip them in this radioactive paint it wasn't like the glow-in-the-dark stuff they have now kind  of safe this was like radium or some shit and they would just dot dot dot dot put little dots around  the dial they unscrewed missiles yeah climbed up a ladder dipped it in the missile take a handful of  fucking shouter out of that missile nuclear goop and and uh in order to keep the brush tip pointy 
[01:09:00]  they would lick it oh so all these women were just coming up with these five-headed children  baby slipper baby slipper baby so they they figured out that it was the paint and what do they do  just dump barrels of this stuff just dump it into the wastewater into the water and the  the surrounding area now it's like baby hiroshima and then they had built on it years after the  factory's gone and years they build on it and all of a sudden the children started coming out all 
[01:09:30]  fucked up and they had a you know dig down in order to clean these things up they got to bring  shit in get rid of all the dirt and can you imagine it's only been a hundred and ten years or some  shit that we kind of had been doing that all that shit you know one of my favorite things ever with  the with uh x-rays or radiation was in the shoe stores back in ye olden days when they first came  up with the x-ray machine they thought it would be a wise thing for shoe salesmen to know what the 
[01:10:00]  people's bone structures look like so they'd uh uh you'd go in and there were x-ray machines at the  shoe stores you'd stick your feet in here and look at this ancient picture tube with with your  feet and the bone structure and the shoe guy would go well you see this bone here you're going to need  this type of shoe and stuff meanwhile they're over-radiated like more radiation you would ever  need for like a lifetime of x-rays on your feet of being pumped into these people and again just

[01:26:00]  worth reading serious shares slide on analyst downgrade we've been talking about this for a while  actually shares of serious satellite radio incorporated dipped tuesday after an analyst  warned that the satellite radio provider could have a hard time matching the hype surrounding  its programming deal with howard stern yes we've been talking about this for months man uh serious is  just banking on howard and that is it and that is why they will fail miserably it's gonna be rough 
[01:26:30]  we've been saying this for months yesterday xm signed bob dylan to do his show  uh and that's what xm does yeah you know they're spreading it out man they're getting uh people  from all over the place uh serious shares fell 45 cents or six percent yesterday anthony ouch  we believe the recent media attention surrounding howard stern's arrival at serious has caused its  stock price to become completely detached from the underlying business fundamentals so uh what they're 
[01:27:00]  saying there opie is that um all the howard hype has pumped the stock up regardless of what the  truth of the matter is based on the company's financials you know if you look deep into the  company's financials uh they're not in that good shape as uh they would like to be i'm sure and i must  disclose right now i am a serious uh stockholder if i'm giving a stock advice i i'm like imus imus is  always talking about you know yeah opie and anthony you're good friends of mine i hope they uh do well 
[01:27:30]  on uh uh uh xm uh but i own serious stock and you know i hope they do well and uh i own the stock i  know what to do you know i make my little trades here and there yeah you'll punch out yeah when you  have to i know when to dump out and they're recommending that you sell serious and buy xm i should  have punched out yesterday uh they're recommending you buy uh xm satellite radio who's more than five  million u.s subs top serious's two million plus count and xm uh satellite radio uh had a good day 
[01:28:00]  yesterday the shares up eight cents yesterday it's gonna be very hard to match the hype it's been a lot  of hype especially lately with uh how we going over there to uh serious but uh it's gonna be hard to  match that hype with reality once it's all said and done and all this hype is over about him leaving  radio and going to satellite and his ass is in the chair and he's doing shows uh that hype fades away 
[01:28:30]  and now uh you know you're talking to a lot less people than you were and the the newspapers write  that you can't what do you think the newspapers are going to go how are you building an audience you  know one person at a time hoping to no it's going to be the ninety percent of howard's audience  doesn't come with him doesn't go with him so you got to build a whole brand new audience that's  what we've done in the last year three months and yeah you're not going to hear howie uh yelling 
[01:29:00]  and screaming that he's going to kick xm's ass impossible will not happen by the way we'll always  have more listeners on radio now as far as this satellite radio game goes it's just how it goes it's  just how the companies are this company much greater than the little doggy company that's a fact you  you know what what was that that quote he's not even allowed in canada we're all over uh canada  he's not allowed to do canada there's a quote he said he'd been doing subpar radio for 10 years 
[01:29:30]  yeah i got that somewhere is that his uh his clip yeah yeah what we love about this clip is because  there's what we love about this clip is uh while he's been doing subpar radio the last 10 years we  made our names in radio in the last 10 years playing by the same rules playing by the this  exact same rules i've been doing subpar radio for the last 10 years all right subpar radio 10 years uh  uh when did uh his movie come out i don't know was it 97 98 somewhere in there probably and a little 
[01:30:00]  before that thing started you know what it is it's not uh it's subpar radio because he's not the same  guy it's not the same show there's no making it the same show again it's just i i can't see it going  back to that when he's on the likes of when he's on the shows of the people that he used to make fun of 
[01:30:30]  when before he started doing what he's calling subpar radio uh that was entertaining when he would  goof on larry king goof on the news programs all this and now he's on there and this kind of started  when his movie came out and you'd see him being on all these talk shows and go wait a minute that  that isn't howard he doesn't do that and i've just proven that he was he's just a phony yeah and now it's  even worse i mean i understand you got to promote yourself and that's fine but uh the whoring that's 
[01:31:00]  going on and the ass kissing with people that just and as a guy that does radio i am completely  embarrassed that he's following us into satellite radio and he has this great opportunity to go on  national tv and tell uh the country uh by the way most of the country still has no clue what satellite  radio is about even though xm's doing great but the potential is just amazing we haven't growing  but we haven't even come close to what this thing is going to do so he has this unbelievable 
[01:31:30]  opportunity to go on national tv and tell everyone what satellite radio is about and he's bragging  that uh you know one of the bits he's trying to do is measure some dude's dump who the fuck cares  yeah that's not what this is about you can do that stuff on the side no problem and people out there  some of them will enjoy it but that's not what satellite radio is about no and and he's an embarrassment  the to the whole industry those are like the little things that you could tissue time he's bragging  about tissue time he's bragging about having girls uh talk dirty on the radio that's what satellite 
[01:32:00]  radio could do you stupid ass and i don't think he understands that when when he was doing that stuff  back in the uh late 80s you know mid late 80s uh there was no internet it was very hard to come by  that type of material so to hear it on the radio was shocking and it was entertaining and you would  stay listening like like you you couldn't tune away but now there's so many options to to that 
[01:32:30]  there's the internet is downloading stuff from ipod like we were talking about earlier that it isn't  the shock value isn't there to where you can't turn it off anymore right it's very easy to turn off  it gets boring quickly right uh what people want is to be entertained on a daily basis they want to  laugh man if you're not doing a funny show every day you're fucked they want to be laughed or at  least they want uh something thought provoking a little of that too sure yeah just in make it 
[01:33:00]  interesting that's all it can't just all be about who we got strippers coming in today strippers i can't  tell you and i've been i've been bashed on uh on message boards and stuff about this saying that i  cannot fucking stand strippers i fucking hate them i hate when they're in here i hate them at strip clubs  i like sitting and looking at them as completely as objects and just looking at their naked bodies  that to me beautiful the second they open their mouths the second they're involved in radio it stinks 
[01:33:30]  on ice i want to choke the shit out of them and throw them out of the window they suck strippers  equal shit radio with their fake moaning and their fake uh i'm enjoying this totally phony  just awful stuff but but you know he trudges on with that torch well because there's nothing else  good luck to you doesn't know how to uh reinvent himself he has no fucking clue it's not like it used 
[01:34:00]  to be you can't just go on and do the shit that you used to do in 85 86 89 howard you go on satellite  radio and measure people's dumps and we'll continue to be funny and edgy and thought provoking have fun  we're gonna kick your fucking ass and you know it he's gotta fill time it's our time now it's our time  you had yours gotta fill time with something now that he can't uh complain guys he'll be so happy 
[01:34:30]  as he's saying god damn i'm yelling and screaming losing my mind and my mentors on the phone oh he's  not gonna he's not gonna be proud of me today brother ways i'm always proud of you opie are you  kidding me are we on with you guys yeah so do we all right no cursing no cursing bombs or no we'll be  good boys for all the stuff that i enjoy when i listen to you guys every day listen the reason  i had a call is i don't know if you guys read this have i mean you guys got a big network has  anybody sent you the bubba article uh it's in front of us right now we haven't had time to to to waste 
[01:35:00]  on bubba but it's it's so goddamn sickening opening these people i mean yeah i saw howard stern on i  forgot which tv show he's promoting like crazy about how his show is all about truth and honesty yeah  yeah yeah and that's something i mean i mean i i don't begrudge people that are fans of howard if  they just see the entertainment value but when they want to believe any crap that he says it makes  you completely sick and he's a big liar and a fake uh hallelujah we've been saying that for a long 
[01:35:30]  time well check this out here's a quote from bubba okay howard and i are on the ground level of the  next big thing in radio yeah added added clem 39 who legally changed his name from todd to bubba the love  sponge yeah when satellite radio does blow up we're the pioneers and howard was the only person  who gave me the opportunity do they not know you guys exist yeah well they're trying to hide that  fact not only do we do we exist we've been doing it for a year and three months now bubba the love  sponge personally uh you know called xm and wanted on xm badly sure they took them off xm but now they 
[01:36:00]  now he forgot it existed yeah well and also uh howard was on with the today show with katie kirk  yeah katie's looking at uh howard and going you know you're going to be the first shock jock on  satellite radio oh god how do we let that stuff happen our company's doing a bad job as far as  that goes they are doing a bad job but the whole thing is this hope i swear to you i talk about it  you got a great show man i think it's way better to stern when he has it so the whole thing is i mean 
[01:36:30]  i don't i think they're going to get killed over there and they're just spending all this money  advertising you know who needs to buy the next thing to hear howard's show and when he starts  getting dirty what's the big deal you guys are the true pioneers of this and you're doing a great  job we as we admitted it too when we first started this we went on we were cursing and doing this and  that and then we'd go to the phones and people were like well so what else you got man no you got  stopped no no i'm just saying in the beginning though that's what we thought it was about we're 
[01:37:00]  like oh we can finally you know say all the curse words and do this and that and and we realized fast  wow man if we do a show where we're just cursing and having strippers in here we're we're screwed  yeah you're sunk but the whole thing is i just can't wait to see what happens when those guys  are on with the stuff that you've been doing for a year and change somewhere some legitimate magazine  articles and newspaper articles got to come out and tell the truth where is it yeah i have no idea  we have to do a better job as a as a company getting uh getting the word out there it's been  frustrating uh howard was on one of these shows last night the daily show i guess talking about 
[01:37:30]  how he wants to you know weigh some dudes dump that's that's his innovative radio he's going to do  on satellite radio uh here's here's a bubble of love sponges last uh statement we're going to do  the kind of radio we're used to doing said glenn remember the days before the decency cracked down  when he had strippers collect toys for charity yeah i'm not going to go buck wild but if i got a girl  in there and whip out and tell her to whip out her milk dispensers i can't wait yes i love how these  guys talk you know they their time uh went past them and now they're gonna you know blame it on the fcc and 
[01:38:00]  stuff we just we just talked about this before you took your phone call we yeah uh we got a clip  of uh howie where where is it where he says he's been doing subpar radio for 10 years right well  like it's the best well anthony and i in that same 10 year period made our names in radio  following the same freaking rules oh i see that's the whole deal and it makes it a little bit harder  i mean he should be proud that he had to follow rules yeah i mean it made it tougher but you gotta

[01:54:30]  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony program on XM Satellite Radio.  It's Whip'em Out Wednesday.  We love the wow, we love the wow, we love the wow.  They got us over a barrel, Patrice.  There's nothing I can know about it.  Got us over a barrel.  We got like three conversations going on right now.  Yes.  And I just dropped my Cheerios all over the floor. 
[01:55:00]  He's eating Cheerios and...  He really makes me sick, and you brought a basket of death.  I got a basket of death and doom out there that I brought in that all of a sudden...  I guess for the first, you know, two hours we've been here, the thing was sitting where  I left it, all still wrapped up in plastic.  It's one of those giant baskets.  What, your head?  You know I got to pick up all the Cheerios or the world's not right.  Every single one. 
[01:55:30]  People are too scared to ask, too, because, you know, it's like, you got a motherfucking soul.  You know, it's like, Opie runs a tight ship, so...  Yeah.  And, you know, I ask, I'm like, who's, uh...  Whose sandwich is this?  What is this, uh...  There's a basket of sandwiches in this motherfucker.  Who's eating them?  And they open it up, and it's chocolate-covered bread.  It's chocolate, and...  I run a tight ship until something goes wrong when, like, my Cheerios fall.  I'm like, oh, Cheerios all over the floor!  You've got to find every single one of them.  The next thing you know, I forgot about the radio show. 
[01:56:00]  It's all about making sure all the Cheerios are back where they're supposed to be.  If you want to fuck me up, just drop marbles, man.  What's far?  I've been chasing marbles all morning.  Everything, man, bed.  Fucking Jack Nicholson.  What's that movie where you...  Oh, yeah, where it is.  85 new bars of soap.  I sound like a scary motherfucker and all that, you know, but all you have to do is  throw marbles at me.  It's all over.  That's my kryptonite.  It's like, oh, boy, look at all the marbles I now got to pick up. 
[01:56:30]  Yeah, I brought that basket in, and it's full of chocolate goodness.  There are gingerbread men in there and all kinds of...  And it's giant.  So it sat there for two hours while people were just drooling, looking at it, wondering  whose it was.  So I walked out for the last break we did, and someone asked, did you bring this in?  I said, yeah.  You know, they go, me and my chick picked at it for, you know, two seconds yesterday, and  she just went, get this the fuck out of here.  I'm about to throw that shit out the fucking window.  And unless I want what we were talking about yesterday, an 800-pound girlfriend. 
[01:57:00]  That basket came with me this morning and sat out there.  Patrice went at this thing.  You know Jurassic Park when the Jeep gets turned over, and he's trying to get at the kids in  the Jeep, and he's pulling the tire off?  That's how Patrice hit this basket.  Fuck.  And it's so good.  The Jeep has disguised healthy shit in it.  It's like, oh, it's pretzels.  No salt pretzels.  Yeah.  Dipped in...  In chocolate.  I know.  There's like this cakey goodness in there and fudged things. 
[01:57:30]  Oh, they're ripping it apart like a gazelle right now.  I know.  The hyenas.  Look at the hyenas.  The hyenas are just ripping it apart.  The hyenas are waiting for the tigers to leave.  The damn gizzard is the only thing left in that thing.  All right.  I had to run out of there.  Let me work out there.  He's been waiting a while, and he's been up all night.  We've got to get David in here from Disturb.  He just played the Nokia Theater last night and just rocked.  Absolutely rocked.  Oh, yeah.  What's up, David?  There he is. 
[01:58:00]  How you doing, man?  How are you?  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony program.  Have you slept yet?  A little bit.  A little?  Just a little?  You ever up this early or no?  Yeah, I'm actually up this early all the time.  Get out of here.  I'm not a big sleeper.  Why?  Oh, you don't sleep in general?  I sleep when I die.  Yeah.  Too much to do right about now.  How many hours a night do you get?  Two to five.  And you're all right with that?  I have been for about 17 years.  God bless you.  I don't know how you do that.  I need like 10, and I never get it.  I don't even remember the last time I got 10. 
[01:58:30]  Really?  Nah.  He's a busy guy, though.  It's a rare, rare night.  So the show went well last night?  Yeah.  Yeah?  Yeah.  The show went real well.  And I talked to Ben, our producer, who's, you know, Mr. He is Mr. Rumor Guy, Mr. Gossip Guy.  He knows everything.  Yeah.  And he was like, oh, it was great.  He was so pissed from the stage.  A guy in the back wasn't doing anything, and he's lambasting him for the stage.  It was fantastic.  I guess some guy was... 
[01:59:00]  There's always one guy, and particularly you come to New York City.  Yeah.  It's like, oh, you think I'm getting up out of my seat?  I am not getting up out of my seat, you know, flipping me off and grabbing his crotch, and  you know, I'm like, oh, that's great.  You go ahead.  Make a spectacle of yourself.  And so I singled him out.  It's the one guy that pisses you off, too, right?  Because the rest of the crowd was probably just having a great time.  Well, there was this one little pocket that looked like it was like the tastemaker section. 
[01:59:30]  Too cool for the room.  Yeah, and they won't stand up and get into the show and whatever, and it's just, I know  some people think it's like pompousness or whatever, but my job as the front man is to  get people involved, is to engage them, and if you're sitting down in your seat at a rock  show, there's something wrong.  Yeah.  If you're not into it, if you're not getting up, if you're not pounding your fists and  show me those devil horns and just going off, then we're not doing something. 
[02:00:00]  Either that or you're not digging what's going on.  Right.  So it's my job to kind of light them up a little bit.  And the guy was all smiley.  He was just happy that somebody was giving him attention.  Acknowledging him.  90% of these people do it just to be able to be noticed.  Hey, I was that guy.  He's singled out.  Okay.  Why would you show up in the first place if you weren't enjoying the music?  Yeah.  Well, yeah, because maybe they have to, or maybe their girlfriend dragged them there, or  maybe, who knows?  What's the mix of the audience? 
[02:00:30]  Guys and girls?  Yeah, yeah.  It's a good mix, actually.  Did you get that?  Oh, we had this one girl on top of the audience last night.  The most beautiful set of breasts I've seen in a long time.  Wow.  And I've seen quite a few.  On top of the crowd.  Natural, real breasts.  Was she topless?  For a little bit.  For a little while, she was flashing them?  Oh, God.  On top of the crowd, though.  I asked her to show me again.  There she did.  It was beautiful.  It was, they were spectacular. 
[02:01:00]  When they're on top of the crowd there, you're just looking like, oh, here it goes, the slaughter,  and hands are coming up, and they're getting gross.  Actually, she was just like, you know, kind of on some guy's shoulders.  Oh, on the shoulders.  So it wasn't riding the crowd.  It wasn't surfing.  Otherwise, I'd feel really bad for her.  I've seen that happen at a lot of rock shows.  They pass girls around like bowling balls, giving them the shocker, and just kind of passing  them to the next guy.  It's like, she's been violated.  I try not to let them do that.  If I see that kind of stuff going on, I say something about it.  But these women have to know. 
[02:01:30]  You can't do that at a rock show.  Some of them like it.  They get a little drunk.  Some of them like it, sure.  Yeah, some of them like it.  Some of them are just hammered.  Some of them like it.  Some of those summer outdoor shows, they're not wearing much to begin with, and they're just  getting violated.  Do you guys still get a good pit going in front?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  That is, that's for the kids.  That pit's for the kids.  I don't remember the last time I got caught up, because I like seeing a band up close,  especially when, before we got into radio, I would just go to shows like A Civilian. 
[02:02:00]  It wouldn't be in some section that the radio station had sectioned off or anything, and  I'd want to get as close as possible.  I think the last show I actually went to was like, it was Chili Pepper.  There's STP.  Oh, no.  Smashing Pumpkins.  Smashing Pumpkins.  And Pearl Jam.  And Pearl Jam.  And Pearl Jam.  It was some ridiculous lineup.  Like, before they all just went huge.  Yeah.  And I was right up front, and they start up, and I got caught in some shit that I swear 
[02:02:30]  I thought I was going to die.  I did not think I was getting out of this alive.  It was at Roseland.  And just trampled.  So I watch now from above and go, get the fuck out.  Yeah, I used to be one of those guys in the pit.  Oh, yeah.  All the time.  Winding up.  Loved it.  Throwing punches.  Now, the minute, you know, they recognize, it's like I lose everything on my person.  Yeah.  They take it all.  You got to rip everything off you.  You're a fucking souvenir, man. 
[02:03:00]  You can't do it anymore.  We got to say hi to a bunch of people here.  Steven and Rocklin.  What's up, Steven?  Yo, I just want to say, man, Disturbed is like my favorite band to come out in the past  probably 10 years.  Since Metallica, I fucking love that band.  Thank you.  You guys are amazing, and I just can't express.  I mean, to anybody who's never heard you, they need to go and pick up every one of your  albums.  Yeah.  Thank you, man.  And I appreciate every piece of music that you put out.  Thank you very much, man. 
[02:03:30]  I feel so out of this conversation, too.  No, you are just out of it.  I just know nothing.  I apologize.  That's right.  Nothing about Disturbed.  Everybody's like, oh, Norton's like, oh, you got to get an autograph.  You got to tell his mama it's hi.  That's a compliment right there that Jim Norton, who doesn't like anybody, any bands that,  unless they've been around for 25 years, he's like, and he loves you guys.  I love it.  The only problem I have is the speeding tickets.  Yeah. 
[02:04:00]  And I'm sure you hear it a lot.  There is something about Disturbed that makes you drive really fast.  And you're trying to sing, and you're putting on an angry face, and you're flying down the  expressway.  It's music that's meant to inspire power.  I got to Disturbed.  Yeah.  I got Disturbed on my iPod, and when I'm not feeling it in the gym, I go right to Disturbed.  The next thing you know, I'm pumping like...  Soldiers.  Ridiculous.  They always tell me.  Yeah.  People serving in the military always are telling me that they're playing our stuff before they 
[02:04:30]  go to battle.  You ever see some of the videos that are coming out of there?  It's amazing the day and age we live in where the soldiers over there are taking their  camcorders.  They're videotaping battles.  Fucking battles, man.  Yeah.  And then they either ship them home or they're on their laptops when they get back.  They're putting them to music and making music videos out of these battle sequences.  Yeah.  And I've seen a few using your music.  And it's kind of twisted and sick at the same time it's some of the coolest shit you've 
[02:05:00]  ever seen.  Yeah.  You know, I don't like any of the dead body stuff, and unfortunately that's part of the  war.  I just like the mechanized shit, the explosions.  Unfortunately, there are people being blown up.  You sound like somebody on that.  None of the dead body stuff.  Yeah.  That murder thing.  I'm not digging it.  It makes a great music video, I've got to tell you.  It's very, very powerful stuff.  I like it, too.  Actually, I watch the History Channel or whatever.  Oh, yeah.  All the time, right?  I love it.  Where does it come from out of you? 
[02:05:30]  Because there seems to be like that just...  The anger you mean?  Rage.  You don't have to look far.  I mean, just have your eyes open.  It's not like...  Is it personal rage, though, or is it just what you see around you?  It's a combination of things.  Yeah.  The music is always reflective, or rather the lyric and what I'm writing about is always  reflective of the vibe of the music.  The music always comes first.  So I'm simply basing it on what kind of energy and what kind of vibe the music is giving me 
[02:06:00]  and how it makes me feel.  So it's not like everything is specifically geared towards anger, but it's healthier that  way.  Yeah.  I mean, you sing about happy horse shit, and it's just not as fulfilling some of the time.  I mean, music is meant to be therapeutic.  It's meant to be able to get out your demons and express your deepest emotional parts of 
[02:06:30]  yourself, and it's effective in that way.  I mean, that's why it kind of...  I'd much rather get energized by a song than get depressed by one.  Even if you're talking about subject matter that is heavy.  Yeah.  Well, some of the songs you would think maybe your upbringing was a little off.  My upbringing was unique, to say the least. 
[02:07:00]  I come from an Orthodox Jewish family and kind of had my tour of five different high schools  as a kid.  Most of them were parochial boarding places where only a bunch of guys and big mansion on the  lake with a bunch of rabbis in it and have to wear a specific dress code.  No newspapers, no television, no going to movies, no fraternizing with the opposite  sex, praying three times a day.  No wonder you're angry. 
[02:07:30]  How you come out of that?  Yeah.  No wonder you're angry.  Just the Curly Q.  Yeah.  Did you have those for a while?  Yeah, that's the technical term for it, Patrice.  I never had...  Curly Q.  I never had...  We call them curly fries here.  What's wrong with you?  They're called payas.  Yes, right.  And I've never had ones that big, but I used to leave them unshaven back in the day.  We're talking like when I was 12 years old or something.  What happened?  Did you have some kind of awakening where you were like, this isn't quite where I want 
[02:08:00]  to...  Well, I studied Judeo-Christian theology for 17 years, and I just never found the elements  within, to be perfectly honest with you, any aspect of organized religion that just  did anything for me significant enough to make me have any sort of awakening.  I'm spiritual.  I believe that there is a God or a power or whatever you want to call it, Mother Nature.  It doesn't matter what you attribute to it, but it's not a business. 
[02:08:30]  And people have no business making it a business.  If I had my way, there would be no organized religion.  Religion shouldn't be organized.  Yes, somehow someone figured out how to parlay someone's hope and faith into a money-making  venture.  I don't know when that happened or how, but...  I'll never forget the first time I walked into the Vatican and just seeing this tremendous  example of just capitalism in religion. 
[02:09:00]  All this gold, all this money, everything that's so showy.  I was like, does God need this?  What is this for?  How does this help me in my life?  Yeah, where it should be a humble place.  Melt it down, take the money, give it to the hungry, give it to the poor, do something  good with it.  You know, I mean, the single largest landowning organization in the entire world. 
[02:09:30]  Yeah.  Catholic Church.  You know, and they're not, you know, there's a song on the record called Deify, and it's  about making a God out of a human being.  It's about attributing God-like qualities to somebody who's just normal like you and  me, and the dangers of that.  And people just need to be so careful.  I mean, I'm not knocking anybody's faith.  I'm not knocking anybody's beliefs.  But, you know, that evangelistic kind of stuff that goes on where, you know, people 
[02:10:00]  go ahead and donate their entire houses and their family, you know, life savings and stuff  to, you know, save their soul is just really sad.  It's a great selling tactic that somebody actually came up with that whole idea of, ah, do X,  Y, and Z, and your soul's saved.  You're redeemed.  Yeah.  I think a lot of artists don't, you find that with artists, every artist, you know, 
[02:10:30]  even a lot of comics and musicians, they don't, they believe in that.  That's what I, that you believe in something because you don't want to be, in case there's  a God, a dude, a white guy, you don't want to be like, fuck that.  I'm like, I don't believe in shit.  But you believe because it is.  It was like, you just believe because it is a belief.  You know it's something bigger, but you don't want to go, like, why am I putting this  money in this little pot to give to God?  Am I giving this shit to God?  And the rules that are written out and, and, and it was all just people writing the rules 
[02:11:00]  and, you know, I'm sure.  Yeah.  St. Paul was a really good, uh, you know, inventive writer.  He came up with a whole new Testament idea.  So David, can I, can I, am I safe at your shows?  Let's be honest.  Are you safe?  I mean, you know, if I go there, is it a lot of, listen, let's be honest.  You wait, like, you're, I, I know I'm a big motherfucker, but, but I'm saying, I know  it sounds like he, they have a lot, but I'm saying, is it, you know.  They won't come out with it?  Yeah.  Is it like, I, like, is it, like, those, like, those, like, yeah, can I go to your shows 
[02:11:30]  and be safe?  Are you trying to say, can I go there and I'm like.  Disturbs more than white boy music.  I'm not trivializing his fucking music.  I'm just saying.  You'd actually be really surprised seeing the range of people that actually come to the  show.  He's trying to say some shit, man.  It's, it's, it's a pretty broad, uh, range of people.  I mean, it's all walks of life, all colors of skin, all ages.  I mean, we get all kinds of people coming into the shows. 
[02:12:00]  That's the beautiful thing about a rock show.  It's not denominational on any level, at least not ours.  You, you, you come in, you're accepted for who you are.  The whole idea is, this is, this is the gathering of the freaks.  This is the gathering of everybody in life who has to worry about everyone else's eyes  on them every moment of their life.  You come into the one room, you're next to everybody, you feel everybody's heat, you feel  everybody's sweat.  You, you, you, you, you join in this gigantic spectacle of just, you know, expelling power. 
[02:12:30]  And it's, it's intoxicating.  That's, that's, that's what any good show should be for, but particularly ours.  I mean, and, and you don't have to be in the pit.  Well, can I start off in the press box just to take a little, take a little up above.  Can I peek down here?  All right, maybe I'll go in that section.  You're going to see some energy down below.  These guys beat the crap out of each other in the pit.  I'm not trying to say his ways, but you know, there's just some, because from what I'm 
[02:13:00]  hearing, it's, you know, like you're saying, it makes people drive fast.  It's like, there's some, there's some energy release.  Yeah.  And, and anytime I see that kind of music, energy release, it has something to do with  like, what is it, Ro, Ro, Ro, Ro, Ro, Ro, Rwana, whatever, those groups where it's  like, when you see white boys and energy, it's just, I, I shouldn't be, it's a totally  different type of energy.  It's just like, it's just our music.  It might turn on to you.  No, no, I can say nigga, like black people can say, what's up nigga, and white people, 
[02:13:30]  you know, what's up nigga, it's like, it's like, I got him, and go, yeah, death to the  law, and they're like, is this nigga doing a, is this nigga doing a devil horn?  You'll be laughed at, but no one will hurt you.  You know, you wouldn't, you wouldn't be the first one, bro.  There's some nigga devil horns going on.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Plenty.  Plenty.  They're niggas doing devil horns.  You gotta get into it.  In fact, I would, I would, I would, I would say without any shadow of a doubt that at  every single performance, there are some.  Yeah. 
[02:14:00]  Every one.  Really?  Every one.  I'm not exaggerating on any level.  David, I gotta ask you about Land of Confusion.  Sure.  But, you know, I read all the trades and stuff, I'm like, wow, Disturbs doing Land of Confusion.  I'm like, what?  And that's a huge song at the show.  Can I listen to that a little bit?  But hold on, because I want to, you know, finish this thought, and then I heard it, I was  like, holy crap, this is awesome.  Thank you.  I mean, but how do you go from, we're going to cover a Genesis song and then turn it into  something?  Well.  You know what I mean?  It seems like that could have fell on, you could have fell on your face with that one. 
[02:14:30]  Yeah.  Well.  Because Land of Confusion was as poppy as Genesis got.  You know what it was?  The cover of Shout kind of probably gave you a little more leeway with, with.  Yeah, but we didn't do anything with it.  You know, we didn't have any intentions of doing anything with it.  With Shout, it was more one of those things that we did when we were still just a little  baby club band.  Mm-hmm.  And we needed to sometimes fill up.  You needed to fill her.  At the time.  We needed three hours of material.  Yeah, at the time you needed. 
[02:15:00]  We didn't have enough original material.  Right.  So instead of just playing, you know, your typical Sabbath and Maiden and whatever else,  you know, we'd throw in there, we'd go left to center some of the time.  And we would want to take something that was nothing like us.  Right.  And make it our own.  No disrespect.  Again, I'm just trying to learn this thing.  So Shout, which Shout is it?  Tears for Fears.  Tears for Fears.  Shout, let it all out.  Right.  Oh, really?  Okay.  That's a huge song in the 80s.  And Land of Confusion.  That's Genesis.  You got to play just a drop of that? 
[02:15:30]  That's Genesis when they were really getting, uh...  What's the melody of it?  Do we have the original?  Another video with the Ronald Reagan puppet.  Yeah, but the song is not.  Margaret Thatcher puppet.  Oh, so you did a remake of the, this is the word, that's okay, and then, but your remake is...  Oh, all right.  It's a little different.  It's just a little.  Well, why don't we play just a little piece of that?  Stop trying to make me a dick.  I'm trying to, like, I don't know at all, so I'm trying to learn. 
[02:16:00]  All right, here's the original.  Just a little piece of the original, Genesis, Land of Confusion.  You know this song.  How many times did you have to listen?  How many times did you have to listen to the original?  Too many.  Too many.  So what was the inspiration from this that made you go, I like the remake, this?  Danny, my guitar player, was watching, you know, some old school video stuff one day,  and the video with all the puppets actually came on with Reagan about to push the button 
[02:16:30]  thinking he's calling for room service.  Yeah.  So he, you know, called me and we talked about it, and at first I was actually really adverse  to it, because I don't like Phil Collins at all, you know, so with all due respect, you  know, I mean, I know we're doing this song, but I'm just not into the vibe.  The vibe, what vibe?  Well, and, you know, I've just heard things about the guy, and I just didn't want to have  anything to do with it at first, and then I started thinking, like, well, listen to the 
[02:17:00]  lyrics, it's very poignant for today's times, you know, it fits, the whole theme of their  video makes sense with today's cast of characters, too.  And, you know, the more we started working on it musically, I started to come up with  ideas for how I'd approach things vocally.  That little keyboard line that you hear in there lends itself very easily to a guitar  riff.  Is he getting paid?  Phil?  Publishing-wise, yeah, he will be.  From this song?  Well, just for being on the record, there will be a mechanical royalty thing. 
[02:17:30]  Have you heard anything from any of the guys in the system?  I don't care.  It doesn't matter.  I mean, if they like it, great.  If they don't, also great.  It makes no difference.  You want to hear what they did with that?  Yeah, definitely.  Listen to this, man.  Listen to the vocal, though, man. 
[02:18:00]  I must have dreamed a thousand dreams.  I can hear the marching feet moving into the street.  How did you read the news today?  They say that they just found our way.  But I can see the fire still on light, burning into the night. 
[02:18:30]  There's too many men, too many people, making too many problems.  And there's not enough love to go around.  And you see, this is a lot of confusion.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  This is the world we live in.  And these are the hands we're given. 
[02:19:00]  Excuse me, let's start trying.  He's got a great voice, too.  Thank you, man.  It's like, he's real sweet.  Because I thought it was going to be right here.  That growling shit.  But it's smooth.  It's kind of, I don't want to get to it.  This is kind of cool that you've never heard Disturb.  Never.  So you're getting like a fresh opinion.  I don't want to get into a fight with Dave, but he sounds like an edgy Phil Collins. 
[02:19:30]  I ain't bullshitting.  No, it's just, it's a Phil Collins-y, it's not, it's just rocky Phil Collins.  You see what I'm trying to say?  Phil Collins on steroids.  Yeah, I got it.  And the lyrics, goddamn, I didn't even realize, it so makes sense as far as today goes.  Is that the closing bit?  Or that's the opener?  Is that the, what's that the big?  In the show, you mean?  In the show, yeah.  In the show, it's somewhere in the middle.  Oh, really?  Oh, is it really?  Yeah, yeah.  I like the guitar on that one, man. 
[02:20:00]  That just sounds amazing.  This is a good song, man.  I like it.  All right.  Goddamn.  A lot of people want in here.  Let's say hi to Paul in Texas.  Paul, what's up?  Oh, David, how you doing, man?  I'm so glad to hear you on the radio again.  Good to be here.  Hey, listen, man, a couple of things I'm going to hit on real quick and I'm going to shut  up.  Sure.  I'm so glad you guys came out with a new album.  I've been waiting for this for a long time.  Thank you, brother.  Track 12, I believe, you need to let them hear that, Patrice, hear that because he's going  to have a shit because you have got a beautiful voice.  Thank you, brother.  Thank you. 
[02:20:30]  You're talking about darkness, yeah?  Amen, brother.  That is my favorite song.  Thank you, brother.  You have that good voice, man.  Really nice.  Yeah.  There's a couple of different styles your voice has.  Yeah.  Definitely, there's one song, god damn, I can't remember, off of the first album, or  at least the one before the last one.  Was that your first album?  The sickness, yeah.  Yeah.  That, it almost had like an 80s sound to it and your voice, your style of singing in  that one is a lot cleaner.  Hmm. 
[02:21:00]  Yeah.  I can't think of which one.  I know.  Me and my great memories.  Probably numb.  Let's go to...  Yeah, I think it was.  Okay.  Let's go to Brother Joe.  Brother Joe.  Hey, gentlemen, what's going on?  Hey, man.  What's up, Brother Joe?  You know what, man?  I don't know.  I just thought I wanted to ask David, were you actually going for a Phil Collins sounding  vocal on that?  Because, I mean, with all due respect, I mean, you know...  There you go.  Thanks, dude.  Oh, shit.  You guys are fantastic.  You guys are unbelievable, man.  I mean, I dig the band, but the whole not digging Phil Collins thing, your voice has 
[02:21:30]  very similar qualities to Collins on that one cut.  Yeah.  Well...  I'm in the studio, and you've got to do the hands back, not being offensive, kind of,  you know...  Nah, it's...  Don't punch me in the head.  Here's the thing.  No offense.  I thought it was going to be...  No.  No.  But it was...  It's smooth, man.  I don't sing that way on any of the songs.  No, he really doesn't.  On any of the songs.  Okay, all right.  We're not Cookie Monster Metal. 
[02:22:00]  That's what I'm saying.  It's like...  Cookie Monster.  No.  I'm saying before...  I'm saying before...  Before I heard, and that's my prejudging of what sound I was going to hear, as opposed  to the sound I heard, which is...  I enjoy it.  You know what I'm saying?  It's an amazing version.  Well, here's the thing with it, is that his range is just very easy for me to hit.  And, you know, tonally, he doesn't have a bad voice. 
[02:22:30]  I never was saying that he was, but hopefully I sound a little bit more like a man.  Yeah, you sound like a deep, edgy, just like Phil Collins that lived, you know what I mean?  Like Phil Collins' voice on steroids.  There you go.  It did have...  It definitely had Phil Collins, you know, attributes.  Hey, Brother Joe, on a side note, you got to call back maybe tomorrow, because I finally  saw a tribute.  Yeah. 
[02:23:00]  Oh, Brother Joe turned us on to this movie Tribute.  David, a whole documentary on tribute bands.  Oh, the one with the Kiss guy who threw himself through his living room window.  Yeah, the Kiss guy got so into the Gene Simmons character that he fucked up his whole life,  and he was starting to believe he was really Gene Simmons, so he lit his whole house on fire.  The fire department said this wasn't an accident.  It looks like this guy lit a fire in every room in his house, and then he crashed through  the front window. 
[02:23:30]  Are you guys tribute band...  Oh, yeah.  There are disturbed tribute bands out there, eh?  There's, like, I don't even know how many...  I'm really apologizing.  Have you seen any?  I'm sorry, man.  Have I seen...  I've seen a couple.  You have?  There will be.  Like live?  There's actually tribute CDs.  Yeah, the tribute thing is blown up.  We even actually have an orchestral tribute to the band, too.  Like a string tribute to Disturb.  Have you ever seen, like, gone into a club where one of them was playing and stood there 
[02:24:00]  and watched and freaked the guys out?  Yeah.  Yeah, one time in Boston.  One time in Boston.  Did they just lose their minds?  They kind of got really nervous.  That's okay.  That's cool.  But, Brother Joe, we'll talk about tribute a little more tomorrow because there are so  many great things in this documentary.  Yeah, there's a lot of moments that would make for a good radio on that thing.  I'll give you guys a call tomorrow.  This is a very inspirational wall you guys have here. 
[02:24:30]  Yeah, the wall-o-chicks.  God, that was when Christina was so hot.  Yep.  Well, we got Christina hot and then even Britney hot.  Just which one isn't like the others?  It's kind of hard to separate them.  Blondes are blondes are blondes.  Well, you better look at that wall.  Oh, what's her name?  Lohan?  No, look a little closer.  There's one picture that doesn't really belong on the wall.  That is put there as a trick.  We got a wall of sick.  This one here? 
[02:25:00]  Which one?  Right there.  The one with the penis?  Yeah.  The dick.  That's a little frightening, dude.  That's for Jim Norton.  That's a little frightening.  Yeah, our little buddy Jimmy Norton.  Let me tell you, there's nothing in the world worse than false advertising, man.  Absolutely.  I would probably lose my damn mind if I was ever caught in a situation like that.  Ever.  Never.  I once spoofed some buddies of mine who were like, we were up in a club in Chicago, a place  called Crowbar, and he was just like all over these two trannies that I knew were trannies. 
[02:25:30]  Yeah.  I kind of let him go for a while, and he's like making out with two of them at the same  time, feeling like king of the world or whatever, but I couldn't let him go home with him.  Yeah.  I'm like, all right, it's a joke.  I am a friend.  Until you get home.  Yeah.  All of a sudden, they whip out the kibbles and bits.  That is really good.  The repercussions. 
[02:26:00]  So many people asking, and you probably get this all the time, too, dropping plates on  your ass.  Yeah.  People want to know.  Well, you probably know the term.  I mean, dropping plates is actually something that is a hip-hop industry term.  When you're saying that you're making hit records, you say that you're dropping plates.  Yeah, it is.  So it's, I didn't invent it.  Right.  But I liked how it fit.  Yeah.  So you just say, hey, yeah, we're making records, we're doing it, we're dropping plates on  your ass, bitch. 
[02:26:30]  Let me ask you, right, the fact that I've never heard of Disturb, right, on the level  of a white guy not hearing of a hip-hop artist, how high is that?  Is that like if somebody says, you know Jay-Z, and the guy goes, no, is it at that level?  No.  No.  I would say in hip-hop, yeah, Jay-Z probably, yeah.  Right.  If I go, hey, you know Jay-Z, and somebody goes, nah.  Is that how fucking stupid I sound?  I never heard of Disturb?  We're the biggest underground band in the world.  And it's like we've sold about seven plus million worldwide. 
[02:27:00]  Damn.  Are you just starting to get the-  Is it stadiums, selling out stadiums all over the place?  Oh, no, no, no.  I, we, we, we do, when we do our own big headlining tour, it's typically like, you know, hockey  arena kind of size places if you kind of get the idea.  Like the Madison Square, the theater at Madison Square going on?  Yeah.  Or bigger than that.  It sounds about right.  Are you getting the people though?  Starting to, you know, motherfucking shell out, man, you know?  So, oh, whenever they're not, whenever you go beyond the point of being somebody's own  little treasure. 
[02:27:30]  Right.  You know, it changes.  They get pissed.  I mean, it's kind of like, you know, you lending out your ex-girlfriend, you know?  She was, you know, she was mine originally.  Now, everybody gets to partake.  Sell out, yeah.  You know, it just pisses people off.  Yeah.  We've got a lot of questions coming in.  Nate in Brooklyn.  Nate.  Hey, good morning, guys.  I've been waiting to hear David Draymond on your show for so long.  David, I'm a huge fan, but one of my best friends swears he went to Yeshiva and Nevaeh  with you.  Is that true?  It's probably true.  In Israel?  Yeah.  In Telso.  What's his name?  Leib Lippman. 
[02:28:00]  Sounds familiar, yeah.  Yeah.  Really?  He was one of my best friends swears, and he said you guys were, he knew you were going  to be huge way back when, when you guys, it was like 92 or 93 or something like that.  How could he know?  I wasn't even doing anything then.  He said, no, he was a drummer, and he said you guys, you and a couple of other guys, you  had a band together, he said.  Okay.  He wanted to form a band with him.  In Israel?  Yeah, this was in Yeshiva in Israel.  Yeah, when I was 18.  Yeah.  Wow.  Awesome.  You guys rock, man.  Thanks, man.  All right, Nate.  Take care.  Bye.  Oh, yeah.  The Richard Cheese stuff.  Yeah, Richard Cheese. 
[02:28:30]  This is great.  You've heard of this?  No.  From the Dawn of the Dead.  Richard Cheese.  He did a remake of a song on the Dawn of the Dead?  Yeah.  Yeah, listen to this.  Listen to this.  This is a lounge version of Down with a Sickness.  Oh, shit.  Which darn is it?  It's a campaign.  I know he's fucking moving the new one.  The one with a...  That one.  That one.  That one.  Sing Rames, isn't it?  Get up.  Come on.  Get down with the sickness.  Get up.

Get down with the sickness.  You fucker.  Get up.  Come on.  Get down with the sickness.  Madness is the gift that has been given to me  I can see inside you  How great is that?  He could have easily been Rod Stewart if he just took a wrong turn and shit 
[02:29:30]  Fuck, he turned right into, like, rock, man  This guy really got a great voice, man  Really good voice, man  That's Dick Cheese  Yeah  That's a guy named Richard Cheese  Isn't that nice?

[02:30:00]  Not you, David  This dude  There's an extreme fighter in the studio  This dude looks great  Making sure everything goes okay here  He has, I'm not coming to his concert mustache  Once a motherfucker has the Fu Man  When white boys get the Fu Manchu  And shave the beard in the middle  They got a little something behind that  That you don't want to know about  Security  And he's with David, right?  Oh, he's making sure everything's okay  And he's right behind me, motherfucker  I'm an entertainer, too  I'm not trying to rob Dave  I'm just all

Hi  Hi  Hi, David  Hi, Wendy  First of all, you have a sexy voice  Thank you  And I saw you three years ago at OzFest in Pittsburgh  I have a question  Sure  I ran into a roadie named Randy

Because typically I don't  Actually, she said she had her picture taken with you  Okay, well, that sounds right  Her name was Paula  She had all these little braids in her hair  So that shit really happens where you've got to blow the roadies and stuff  Oh, that's great  Yeah, the roadies are getting the action  Oh, yeah, he's disgusting  And listen to Miss  Well, it all depends on what kind of action you're looking for  Ah  You know  I mean, I  How long ago were we talking about here?

[02:35:30]  Don't be too hard on that shout cover that you did  You guys are like downplaying me  You just did it  It's still up to the pub  And our house said  Start or disturbed  I've got a four-year-old  Who's been rocking out to that  And he just loves it  Cool  A four-year-old son  Nothing wrong with that  He's turned six now  And he heard the  Tears for Fears version of it  The other day  And he just didn't like it  Started crying  Like, what's this?  It's not hard enough  Good, good  All right  Thank you  All right, let's go to Louisiana  Paul, what's up?  Hey, David  You did a deal on the Playboy channel 
[02:36:00]  About two years ago  I watched  You were taking pictures  Of one of the Playmates, right?  Yeah  And you were saying something to her  That they would not say  But she kept going  I wish you'd stop  He's making me blush  What the hell were you saying?  You want to know what I was saying?  Uh-oh  That girl read as an apple  Yeah  They did not say it  I can do that sometimes  I was just trying  I was just trying to inspire her  To get a little sexier with me, bro  I went up to her 
[02:36:30]  I went up to her  I started whispering in her ear  I said, pretend there's no one else in the room  Pretend it's you and me  And pretend it's about three drinks in  And just relax  And pretend like you're doing this for me  Forget everybody else in the room  You're doing this for me  And you're building me up  To the point where we're going to finish this  And I was just talking about that kind of stuff  And she was all about it  And it's very unfortunate  That her, like, kind of boyfriend  Was, like, hovering over the whole situation 
[02:37:00]  Ah, shit  You're not married?  Oh, no  Smart, man  Oh, no  Look at that, right?  Smart, man  Smart fucking man  What do you think of the rock stars  That get married?  God bless them  I mean, man  Oh, fuck that  Well, three of the guys  In my band  Are, you know  Either ready or on the way  Are potentially ready to give away  Half of what you've made  Isn't that?  Nah, it's not about that  Why be a rock star  You get to a certain place in your life  How many times are they crying on the bus?  And, you know 
[02:37:30]  Where all of the backstage craziness  And whatever  It does get old after a while  I mean, I'm nowhere near  The kind of dog that I used to be  When, you know  First Ozfest  When the record first came out  Things blew up  And, you know  You're kind of like  A kid in a candy store  I mean, we used to have contests  Me and guys  How many girls  We could bang in a day  You know  And, like  It would be me  And two other guys  On Ozfest  Just neck and neck  And I think like  I think the most I ever did  In one day  Was like six 
[02:38:00]  And, you know  It was just  Right  And that was when  You were just trying to  You know  Do numbers  But that was  That kind of passed  Relatively quickly  Yeah  And these days  And I was always safe  I don't want to die  Doing these shits  Everybody has to have  An age disclaimer  Yeah  Yeah  Oh, with condoms on now  I'm not sick  You know something?  You'd be surprised  How many girls  Would  Are willing to just  Go raw  All of them  And it's so wrong  All of them  It's so wrong  It's worse than we do  Yeah  But, you know something? 
[02:38:30]  I hate VD worse than they do  So  It's alright  I'm not done fucking until  My fuck career  Is not done until  I can  Like  Continuously fuck  Mixed girls  Like half Asian  Half Hawaiian bitches  When  When I can get those bitches  To just fuck me  You know  What are you, baby?  I'm Mongolian  And fucking Russian  Good  And I can fuck them  Then my fuck career  My  My  Fuck thing is over  That's when I'm like  You know what?  I'm just gonna concentrate  On my career  Yeah  You get to a certain point 
[02:39:00]  Though where you're  You're more discerning  Yeah  You know  And I'm very, very picky  You had them all, right?  I've had my share  Enough  Half Mongolian  Half  I like  I like, you know  Different ethnicities  I like  And you don't have to use the sheet  When you have sex  Oh, no  I don't have the sheet  The sheet  Man, we all start  Curb Your Enthusiasm  I had no idea  That was going on  Until I watched  Curb Your Enthusiasm  That's a bunch of nonsense  It doesn't actually  The sheet through the  The sex through the sheet  With one hole 
[02:39:30]  There's one  Or two  Ultra crazy orthodox sects  Of Hasidic Jewry  Living in Israel  Like there's a group called  The Satmer Hasidim  And there are some of them  That will utilize that method  Because it's still a matter of  You know  Just trying to be demure  And humble  And just not  Throw everything out there  But the whole point of sex  Is to be able to get turned on 
[02:40:00]  The whole point of sex  Is to see your wife  Or your significant other's body  And let that be inspirational to you  Otherwise  How do you keep things going?  I wouldn't be any good  Fucking a sheet  You know  I mean  The sheet  That is one of those things  That have just  It's stayed  In urban legend  It's just legend  Yeah  Literally  I mean believe me  I've got like  200 some odd relatives  Still living in Israel  A lot of them are Hasidic  A lot of them are very religious  None of them  No sheet  No  You drive through Brooklyn  It's not like I ask all of them 
[02:40:30]  Hey you've been fucking through  The sheets lately  But you know  You drive through Brooklyn  With a friend  And they'll be  Hey you see that fucking guy  You know  He's got to fuck her  Through a sheet  You know  It's always got  Someone's always got  A fucking story  You know  Let's go to  Mike in Jersey  Mike what's up  Hey I want to ask Dave  Back of the music  What is that  Music as a weapon  Sure  You got on stage  At Asbury  And some dude  Got messed up  In the pit  And you actually  Stopped the show  Were you actually  Going to stop it 
[02:41:00]  Because I was  Yelling and screaming  You ain't got a hair  In your ass  To stop this show  With all these people  Oh yeah  I'll stop it  At a moment's notice  I'll stop it  For any reason  That's valid  You know  The last thing  You want to see  Is somebody get hurt  But you know  I'll stop the show  For you know  Somebody being insolent  I'll stop the show  If they're being  Too gropey  With the girls  On top of the crowd  I mean  There are certain times  When you need to  Pull people in check  And this music 
[02:41:30]  Has a tendency  To like I said  To let the animal  Out of people  Yeah  You got to  Be careful sometimes  And pull back  On the reins  Right on  And the second question  Was did you choose  Starland  For the tour  Personally no  We went ahead  And when we did  This whole  J√§germeister run  Part of what we set up  Was we wanted  To make sure  That instead of  Going into  Big rooms  All over the country  And doing one night  That we do  Multiple nights  In small venues 
[02:42:00]  So Starland  Was actually  A venue that I dug  From the last time  That we played there  About a year and a half ago  So I was certainly  Into it  But I personally  Don't choose the venues  I kind of leave that  To the age  Sonny Ferrelli  From Boston  A faithful listener  Of the show  Asked Dave  About the reporter  That called him  A white supremacist  Did that go down  A Jewish white supremacist  Isn't that funny  This is delicious  I want to hear this one  I love it  What the hell  What she said  Was that  I was  Part of the show 
[02:42:30]  I have people  Put their fists in the air  It's part of the concert experience  And they're thinking  Fists in the air  Some sort of  You know  Nazi rally  Right  Some guy had  Copper tunnel  Syndrome  But couldn't close his fist  Couldn't close his fist  You just did one of these  Like  Fucking Nuremberg  Yeah  Bunch of nonsense  Unbelievable  I've gotten into more  Fights  In my lifetime  Physical fights  With  Neo-Nazis  Probably than anybody else 
[02:43:00]  On the planet  Really  I  In my youth  That's all I did  And Chicago  Used to have a bunch of them  I don't know if you remember  Back in the days  In the late 70s  There was that march  In Skokie, Illinois  Of the white supremacists  There used to be a lot of them  And I  Used to wear  The skull cap  And the whole nine yards  It was very  You know  I had no problem  Showing my Jewish heritage  Right  That's fucking great  And you know  I remember one time  Going to  A little kid  Just going to the arcade  You know  Got my allowance 
[02:43:30]  Was going to go play  Some video games  Have a little fun  And you know  These two  Well  Neo-Nazi skinheads  You know  They scoped me out  I'm on my way  Out of the arcade  And they're like  Hey Jew boy  You look like  You got a lot of money there  And you know  One guy comes behind me  Grabs me by my arms  And you know  The other guy  Starts to  You know  Trying to get the wallet  Out of my pocket  After he  You know  Gave me a nice little  Fist to the face  So I ducked down  Lifted my heel  Into the guy behind me  His balls  Went to my bicycle 
[02:44:00]  Pulled off my bicycle chain  And proceeded to  Whip the living shit  Out of these guys  Until there was  Blood all over me  That's the anger baby  Blood all over the floor  That's the fucking anger  Right there  I go home  Run  Race home on the bike  I come home  I got blood all over me  My mother's like  Oh my god  What happened to you  I'm like  It's not my blood  That's great  That's great  There's nothing  That chaps my ass  More  Yeah  Than you know  These ignorant  Hateful 
[02:44:30]  Bastards  That have no  Reason to exist  On this planet  I think every time  That there's a  Nazi demonstration  Or a march  That there should be  A little bit of  Napalm dropped  On the area  I  They don't deserve  To live  Is that  When you listen to  A song  You want to talk  About a final solution  But without them  Without them  We don't have  Disturbed  Those two dudes  Made you  The fucking  Angle we have today  I would never  I would never  Give them that credit  Never  There's plenty of  Things to be angry about 
[02:45:00]  What a KKK  Made me funny  Who are you directing  A song like  Enemy  Who is that  Enemy is a song  About  The name of the song  Is actually  Conflict  Enemy is repeated  A million times  In the song  But the song  Is about war  People who look  For an excuse  To go to war  People who  Are always trying  To find a reason  Making everybody  Out to be an enemy  Finding one  Finding one  Within yourself  That you are  Actually the real 
[02:45:30]  Catalyst for it  Because you're  Just looking for  Another person  To fight  Right  Yeah that's  Another great song  If I may  Kiss your ass again  Thank you  So obviously  You voted for Bush  No  Oh that poor  Stupid man  We have an  Illiterate  It's unbelievable  It's unbelievable  Unable to speak  War mongering  Deal making  Terrorist harboring 
[02:46:00]  You must have  A few songs on him  Right  DFI  That song I spoke  About earlier  Starts out  With an excerpt  From Bush's  9-11 speech  Exactly  Case in point  You idolize  Somebody  You make a god  Out of them  You attribute  To them  Supernatural powers  After 9-11  Everybody wanted  Bush to come  And save us  And protect us  And keep us safe  And we're willing  To waive our rights  And waive our freedoms  And do anything  That's necessary  To do that  And you know  It continues to shock me 
[02:46:30]  Every day of my existence  The tremendous  Just bit of forgery  And how he's worked  Over the American people  The saddest thing  To buy into all of this shit  Isn't the people  That were bamboozled  At the beginning  Because I was one  Of those people  I was bamboozled  I looked  I listened to the  The speeches  I watched the  UN presentation  I did  All that  The sad part  Is the people 
[02:47:00]  That still  After shit comes out  And you absorb it  From different things  The internet newspapers  The news  Just what you're reading  What you see on TV  Any information  You can get  And you use your own mind  To kind of  Fill in the blanks  And you're still  Walking around  Toting the company line  It's called denial  Yeah  It goes beyond denial  Though  It's like  At least denial  There's somewhere  In the back of your head  That you're going  I know this is bullshit  But I just gotta  You know 
[02:47:30]  This is what  The truth is  There are people  That just  Completely still  Believe all the shit  And will  Never waver  Yeah well  There are people  Who believe  In war in general  You know  People who just  Love war  Who love going  Looking for a reason  Who love feeling  Like the tough kid  On the block  There's a line there  Though because  There are instances  Where war is necessary  And there are people  That believe 
[02:48:00]  That you should  Never ever go to war  War is a last resort  War is not something  That you use  To facilitate things  Right  And you know  The reasons  Just kept changing  The reason for the war  Cannot keep changing  First we're going  To go ahead  And find  You know  Every single aspect  Of Al-Qaeda  On the planet  Yeah  You know  Then you know  That changes to  Well oh  While we're there  I think something's  Going on with  Saddam Hussein  Let's go ahead 
[02:48:30]  A lot of weapons  A lot of weapons  Yeah  I will look for those  Then it goes to  Liberating Iraq  Which was not  As far as I knew  Under occupation  To be liberated  Wow  Then you know  And then we're going  To go ahead  And make sure  That they have  A democratic society  Mind you  Which has not existed  In an Arabic culture  In 3,000 years  Okay  But we're going  To pull it off  This time  Of course  It's just 
[02:49:00]  We're due people  We're due  It's supremacism  It's us pretending  That our way of life  Is better than theirs  Which have existed  For centuries  And going in  And saying  Maybe they don't  Want our way of life  Maybe they're happy  The way they are  Maybe they're happy  With having  A Islamic fundamentalist  Leader  That's somebody  That their masses  Can actually believe in  As opposed to  Elections  And so on and so forth  They don't necessarily  Want all of it  That's fine  As long as they 
[02:49:30]  Leave us the fuck alone  That's the operative  Point of it  Because if you put  A religious fundamentalist  In  Odds are  They're going to  Rally their people  Based on the hatred  Of the way of life  Saddam wasn't a fundamentalist  Though  It wasn't  No no no  Saddam wasn't  Fucking with us  Saddam was probably  The lesser of two evils  To be perfectly honest  The guy  I don't remember him  Ever doing anything  That really put a direct threat  To the United States  Of America  Kuwait  Fine  He's threatening  His neighbors 
[02:50:00]  And  The only threat  There ever was  Was to Israel  The only threat  There ever was  Was to Israel  And  You know  It's sad  That they're  In the middle  Of this whole thing  Because it's always  A matter of  It always comes back to  Well  We're going to push  The Jews into the sea  Great choice of real estate  By the way  Over there  Hey let me tell you  Us Jews  We know where to buy  Do you think Bush  What was wrong with Peru  You think like Bush  Like  Here's 
[02:50:30]  A song  That like  Deify  Deify  And  It's like  He's like  You know  Fuck  You know  Fuck this dirt  They don't know  What the fuck  I'm doing out here  Nothing would make me  More proud  Pop that in  Pop that in  For a presidential limo  Listen to that  Hate that guy  Fuck yeah  Let's go to Bob  I don't think he's  Ever heard of it  Bob the trucker  Bob  How you doing guys  Pretty good Bob  This is one of the most  Intelligent rockers  I've ever heard

[02:56:30]  Anyone know?  January?  Hopefully  Love that show  It's so hard to keep track of all the different shows  Between Showtime and HBO  And reruns  And when the new ones come on  And there's so many different shows to watch  You do the Entourage?  No, I never got into the Entourage  Oh man  I'm on the Deadwood  Rome  Curb Your Enthusiasm  Sopranos  I'm on those shows  Oh, go Entourage  Entourage is a lot of fun 
[02:57:00]  A lot of fun  A lot of fun  I was gonna say something  The only network show I'll watch these days is  My Name is Earl  I like that one  Dude, I'm finally taking a peek at that  Pretty funny  I thought that was like  Just one of those dumb shows that would last like two episodes  Yeah  Jason Lee is great  He's hysterical  It got nominated for Golden Globe and all that too  Yeah  It's doing great  Yep  Yeah, we'd love to have him on the show  But nah, another guy that we missed our chance  A lot of these guys they blow up and they forget about their old pals Opie and Anthony  Yeah 
[02:57:30]  Remember the days we used to have Jack Black on the show?  Jack Black  Yeah  Now he's in the biggest blockbuster, gonna be the biggest blockbuster movie ever  And he was very appreciative when he was on our show a few years back  Yeah  We're not gonna see Jack Black walking through that door to promote Kong  When was the last Jack Black movie where he came in to see?  Probably the fat movie there or whatever it was  Oh, that there, okay  No, I think it was with Colin Hanks  Well, it was Colin Hanks who's also in Kong, right?  Is he?  Isn't Colin Hanks in Kong?  He is in Kong  He is, right?  Colin Hanks, that movie, what was that? 
[02:58:00]  It was that  I was in the studio that day  Orange County  You were in the studio the day both those guys came in?  I was trashing Colin Hanks and I think that, I think  I was trashing Colin Hanks from acting like he was too cool to be Tom Hanks' son  No, no  Jackass  Dude, he was really cool though because it turned out he was a fan of the show  And he was getting like stuff off the internet and stuff and keeping up with the show  And he was a major fan  And I'm thinking, Tom Hanks' son is listening to us? That's pretty fucked up  He's in that? Yeah 
[02:58:30]  He is, right?  Yeah, he plays Preston  What about the poor other guy from Tenacious Day, Opie?  Opie, what about him?  What about him?  What'll happen to the other guy from Tenacious Day?  In the words  Poor thing  In the words of Moving Pictures  Yeah  Moving Pictures  Yeah  Circa 19  I don't know  We'll give it 83  Yeah  What about me?  What about me?  What about me?  It isn't fair  What about me?  You know that song from Moving Pictures?  What about me?  One Hit Wonder 
[02:59:00]  Do we have that in the old Master Computer?  Mm-mm-mm  Yeah, what does he do?  He's like the other guy from Wham  Well, no way  But he's as physically awful as Jack Black is too  It don't matter  No, Jack Black has a lot of talent  And the other dude is in all of Jack Black's movies playing that little small part  Oh  Just to have that loyalty thing  Yeah  He's hoping his Jack Black connection gets him in King Kong  Yeah  Hey, you know, dude  I think they need a guy to play the eyebrow of Kong 
[02:59:30]  I'll see what I can do  They put senses on your body  And you arch your back like when he looks happy  You're gonna be the eyebrow  That's an important part  What was the movie?  School of Rock or whatever it was?  Yeah  I think he was like the gym teacher  Oh  In the teacher's conference room  Can you do amazement with your body as an eyebrow?  Oh  Yeah, that's good  But no  Maybe you could play a nostril  Look, dude  I'm not gonna go to Peter 
[03:00:00]  If you're not good at being an eyebrow dude, alright?  You can't embarrass me like this  Alright, alright  You know it's over  Gotta be a better eyebrow, man  The other guy from Tenacious D  Oh, the other Tenacious D guy  What was the year on moving pictures?  What about me, by the way?  Is that close?  No one?  No clue?  Alright  Get rid of that  So Jack Black, could you think you can get him on the phone?  Never  Ugh  Are you kidding?  You're looking at two guys that just know the game  The guy is in King fucking Kong 
[03:00:30]  We get you fuckers on the way up  And we get you fuckers on the way down  So, that's what I'm saying  Now, are you accepting him back?  Because it wasn't a falling out  He's just not available  So when he comes back down to say he's doing King Kong 4  He'll be on our show  Because Peter Jackson is not going to have anything to do with that  And he comes back and he's like  Hey, how you doing fellas?  Will you be like, how come I didn't see you on King Kong 1 and 2, man?  Dude, our show is all about  You know, we get these guests  If we were in a time machine, man, it would be the coolest thing  Oh, A-list  It would be unbelievable 
[03:01:00]  A-listers in a time machine  We're the last ones that got to interview Kato Kalin, okay?  Yep  He did every other interview in the world  He finally walked through that door about a month ago  That's our hell  We get you on the way up and on the way down, man  When you're on top  No one has called us when they're on top  Who's the biggest, biggest  Who is the biggest rise from you guys interviewing?  Like you  The biggest star from when he started the lowest point  To when you got him  You understand what the question is?  Wow 
[03:01:30]  He was really like, whew, nobody  And then  Was nothing  He's humongous now  Like he would go, huh?  We're going to have to think about that one  Who?  There's a bunch of them out there  Jack Black obviously  Jack Black is pretty big  He was a nobody when you first started talking?  Oh my god, yeah  It was just, you know  Tenacious D?  Yeah  Sully from Godsmack used to just hang out  Because he had nothing to do  Before he was a rock star  Yeah  Can you get him on the phone?  A guy named Jim Norton  Jimmy Norton is going to make the B-O show now  Can't get Jimmy on the phone 
[03:02:00]  I'm trying to think, man  Yeah, we get him on the way down  We get him on the way down  And then sometimes because of our exposure  We give him a little bump up  But not enough to get him back too high  Dice  That's what I was thinking when I said that  Dice  But Dice had to be on the way down  When he saw you  When he first let come in here  Oh yeah  Dude  Dice was gigantic  And then when we had him on the show  He had already been completely done  Did you get the Dice that looks like Don Rickles?  And then we 
[03:02:30]  No, he still kind of looked like Dice back then  Because it was, you know, late 90s, I guess  Yeah  And then, you know, we pumped it up to the point where he played the fucking garden again  Know who used to kiss our ass?  Know who used to kiss our ass?  Fred Durst  Fred Durst  All right  We had him on before anyone knew who Limp Bizkit was  Really?  Oh, and he was so thankful  And when can I come back  Yeah  And blah, blah, blah, blah, blah  Can you get him on the phone?  Right now?  Fuck no  Is there any big stars that you goddamn guys can get on the phone  Right now 
[03:03:00]  And say, what's up, man?  This is ONA  We just wanted to say congratulations on how  Jack Black wouldn't take your call  Fuck no  I refuse to believe this  What do we have?  Who does Ben have in his Rolodex?  That would take our call right now?  Yeah  I don't know  No one, right?  Not really  And that's sad  Man  You would think we would have a Rolodex and just go  All right, call this guy up, Rolodex  What year is this?  All right, ready?  Who's the...  What relationship has maintained, cultivated?  Even...  And they don't have to be meteoric rise  But just a steady climb  And they were kinda low when y'all met them 
[03:03:30]  But they still...  They beggar  But they still kinda say, what's up, fellas  And you can...  The new show  We don't have that yet  We really don't  You know, at the old show, Jay Moore, obviously  You know, Dennis Leary is...  Yeah, okay  He's pretty damn big  And he's still, you know  But comics are loyal, man  Comics are loyal  Yeah, they are  I'm talking about actors that come on  And radio  And musicians  Comics, you could probably call any comic  Yeah  That got big when you started  And...  Dennis Leary was on The Big Idea last night  Donny Deutsch is asking about Howie 
[03:04:00]  And the little dog company  And then Dennis basically said  Fuck that  I have XM in my truck  And I listen to Opie and Anthony every day  That was cool  That was really cool  Yes  Fuck that, call Jack Black right now  What's the number?  Yeah, we don't...  We don't have that number  He has the same number  Who's calling Jack Black?  I'm telling you  Something about L.A.  He's lonely  King Kong  He's lonely  King Kong  He's in King Kong  He's lonely  Call him  Only on every interview show I've seen him on 
[03:04:30]  Plug in that movie  Yeah  That guy's everywhere right now  Everywhere  Oh, that's crazy  Damn, what are we gonna do?  Look who we got  We have the CEO of Bowdog.net on the phone  Bowdog.net's on board with us  Bowdog.net where you learn to play poker  Calvin  Hi, how are you?  There he is  Are you an actual CEO?  Absolutely  That's what I do day in and day out is run Bowdog  I can tell you  You are the first CEO we've ever had on the show 
[03:05:00]  That's funny  Donald Trump has to be a CEO  He's not  He's a figurehead  You don't think he's a real CEO?  Trump is a complete figurehead  What about the time we had Bill Gates on?  Do you think a CEO that really runs a company has time to do a TV show?  You're probably a busy guy, Calvin, right?  I'm actually quite busy  But it's still important to take time to get your message out  So we're happy to talk to people like yourself  No problem  CEO-ing  You know, the poker craze just completely took off when 
[03:05:30]  Of course the World Series of Poker  The Poker Tour, the Celebrity Poker Challenge, all that  And you started seeing poker sites popping up all over the place  What made you think to get into this and not think, well, it might be saturated at this point?  Well, we actually didn't have any choice but to get into the poker business  Because we were already big in sports betting, casino, and horse racing  And, you know, players that are playing with us obviously are also playing poker  Because everybody's playing poker these days 
[03:06:00]  So we did it from a customer retention perspective  That makes it so that they don't have to go to another site to play poker  They can do it all with us  So from our perspective, we actually didn't look at it like as if we were starting out and starting up in poker  We were just adding another product that we knew that are already existing customer-based liked  So it was a customer retention move more than anything  Horse racing online?  Yeah, we have horse racing  Get out of here  How did that work?  Well, you bet on the tracks the same as if you were actually sitting there watching it 
[03:06:30]  But you bet straight into a pool with us  And, you know, the only difference is you can't actually watch the horse race itself  See, that stinks  I want to be able to watch the horse race  Like when I go to OTB, or when I used to go to OTB  You could watch the horses run  It's almost like going into a casino betting some money  And then the dealer just saying you lost  Taking the money away  I want to see some cards 
[03:07:00]  It's pretty funny, I agree  But we offer it again as a loyalty thing  It's not a super big channel for us  And we would gladly offer the actual race  But the tracks themselves don't like to give it to us  Yeah, well it's all about poker these days though  It definitely is  Poker is huge  And it's got coattails  Poker's actually, in my opinion  It's improved the respectability of the entire space  Yeah  And what does Bodog offer as far as poker goes?  Well, on Bodog.net, that's a play for fun site 
[03:07:30]  Where you can go and learn how to play  We obviously have our real money sites as well  But you want to go to the one where you learn first though  Yes, absolutely  I would gather  Go to Bodog.net, you can play  Actually, the biggest thing we've got coming down the pipe right now from Bodog  Is in the middle of January we're launching a new poker interface  It's the Bodog Poker 2.0  And we think it's going to change the way people look at playing poker online  Because this will be the first time that a poker interface has been designed from scratch 
[03:08:00]  Solely for being played on the internet on a computer  Whereas previous generations, including the product we currently have out there  We're all pretty much just take what happens in the real world  And pretend you're floating ten feet above the table watching the game  Oh, so this is going to be a little more like a first-person perspective?  Well, it's going to be all about you, this one  There's not going to be a table  Everything's going to be designed around how you can access your information  The way that you would want to access it 
[03:08:30]  So you're always going to be aligned  So that you're always, no matter when you can come into the table  And who else is playing  Your interface is always going to look the same  Your stuff's going to be at the bottom  And the rest of the people's information will be scattered around there above you  But it's also going to have the ability to play multiple tables in one window  And it's going to have a whole bunch of other stuff  That's going to make it very, very slick  You know what I liked about Bowdog?  I went on Bowdog.net, signed up, got on there  My favorite thing, the timers are a lot shorter than the other poker sites 
[03:09:00]  Because if I've got to sit there and wait for some idiot to bet  Like the guys get online and they think they're on the World Poker Tour  That they could sit there and mull over their hand for 20 minutes  I like the countdown timer  It goes, boom, fold your hand, move on to the next guy  Absolutely  We try to have a number of different timing ranges as well  To appeal to different speeds  Keeps it moving a little faster, I like that  What's this Bowdog television? What are you into?  We started out in sports betting 
[03:09:30]  Then we expanded into casinos, horse racing, poker  And then in the last 12 months we launched a music label  And now we've started producing television content  And our first television show entirely produced by Bowdog  And actually with me as the host of it  Will be a charity poker event and rock concert  That we hosted for the U.S. military in Hawaii last summer  So it's got a great cause  It's the Fisher House Foundation, which is a military charity  And it's all about the troops 
[03:10:00]  So these are the people that are out there  And no matter what side you are on the politicals  You know, from a political perspective  The guys that are out there doing the heavy lifting  Aren't involved in politics, they're just following orders  And we thought it was time to do something for them  So this is airing on Spike Sunday night at 1230  And the beautiful Shannon Elizabeth involved?  Shannon Elizabeth will be there, yes  And the soup dog  We've got Stella Warren  Who actually won the tournament, first time ever  And we've got a number of comedians 
[03:10:30]  Carson Daly is there, Colin Quinn, Wanda Sykes  Colin's one of the worst poker players ever  And he wins  I hate that  No, he didn't win our tournament  Good, good  How old a CEO are you?  I'm 44 years old  Oh, okay  Because you sound kind of young  I would have wanted to hate you if you were like 21  I hate these guys  You know, I started out just writing some code for Java  And now I'm a multi-gazillionaire  I'm 23 years old  And everyone hates me 
[03:11:00]  That's funny  That's funny  That's funny  Because I've been flying for the last week all over the United States  I've been in six cities in about seven days  And I just landed here  And I don't think I've adjusted yet  Well, you go take a nap  And we'll all go to bowdog.net  Sign up and learn how to play some poker  Excellent  Thanks a lot, guys  Thanks for having me  Thank you, Calvin  Cheers, bye  Bless Calvin  Bless Calvin Air for coming on this program

Oh, that's not  It just  It was kind of seeming like the same thing for the last couple days  Oh my God  It's been a whole new side of him today  And I'm loving him all over again  And then look at this  It says, again guys  Another great show 
[03:15:00]  Patrice gets third chair  Don't make a fucking maniac out of me  And that's Nick checking in  This whole thing is so hard to figure out, man  You can't  You can't  I think we've been having just killer  I can't even say nothing to that asshole  I think we've had nothing but killer shows with Patrice O'Neal the last week and a half  Not even a question  I mean, we look at the clock and it's almost 11 o'clock  We're like, what?  What?  That's a sign that we're having a good show  I get sick of me  And I get sick of me  And I get to the point where, like, the end of the show rolls around  And then I go, alright 
[03:15:30]  We got, like, 20 hours for enough shit to happen  Because by 11, you know, I'm out of shit  Yeah  I'm out of gas  If we had to do a show till noon, we'd be in big trouble with that last hour  Because I got nothing left in the tank  That would be a fun show on radio, though  Wouldn't it?  Yes, it would  Scratching and clawing to keep above water  But then in 20 hours, miraculously, four hours more shit is in my head to talk about 
[03:16:00]  I don't know where it comes from  By the end of the show, I'm referring to myself as that Patrice guy  That's my own head  How the fuck is this Patrice guy talking about?  And then we have 20 hours to get that material ready to go for tomorrow  But I don't do anything that gives me enough information for four hours of conversation  Just a little rest  I don't know what it is  A little rest  And the radio guys take care of the rest while you're sleeping  I don't know  Somehow, 20 hours passes  I got four more hours worth of shit to say  What the fuck?  11-01, I'm out of shit to say  Fucking Patrice, enough already 
[03:16:30]  Enough of me  And listen, we still got lots of stuff to do  And we can squeeze a few in before 11 o'clock  We gotta get Steve in studio  Because he handed in something that I don't know  Uh-oh  I don't want to be connected to this  Now you're scaring me  I don't want to be connected to this  You scare me when you just say  Steve handed something in  But now it's something you don't want to be connected to  Alright, it's on a CD  It's 46 seconds long  And all it says is  Loudest orgasm ever  Now you're thinking to yourself  Alright man, that's pretty fucking cool 
[03:17:00]  Alright  Right?  Yeah  Until you find out that it's a guy  Stevie there  It's a fucking guy  Three days of fitness  This is my short driving  Three, this is the third day of faggot  Third day, Patrice  Third fucking fag day  And thank you because now Patrice is just gonna obsess on your fucking comment now  It's like reading something on the message board  You were great, great show, great show, great show  You were great, I love you, I love you  You fucking suck, same shit every day  Motherfucking I suck, it's the same shit every day 
[03:17:30]  Self-esteem  One guy  Alright, Steve  The disc in your hand is an audio clip that someone sent in  It's actually a video clip that someone sent in  And they were commenting on it because you had played  Did you get to see the video yourself?  Yeah, I did actually  Ooh, is it sexy?  No  It looked like a lion chomping down on a gazelle  What was the scene?  The scene was a white woman on a bed in a cheesy motel room  Bent in half with one of her legs up by her ears 
[03:18:00]  And a black guy just pumping away on top of her  And about five seconds in the audio kicks in  This guy having an orgasm, having an explosive orgasm  Is it outside?  Does he pull out?  No  Okay  He hangs around inside  Alright  Cream pie as they call it  Cream pie  Cream pie as they call it in the porn industry  Cream pie  They get $1,850 for women that do cream pie  $22,000 for A&O cream pie 
[03:18:30]  For information  He's right  How about that?  Wow  But the email I got was  Hey, if you think that Tom Sizemore orgasm clip is bad  You gotta check out this one  Let me play the Tom Sizemore  Alright  That's the excuse we're using today?  That's the excuse we're using  Because that was what I got in the email  Alright, well Anthony's finding the Tom Sizemore clip  Here's the Tom Sizemore clip from his sex tape  Oh!  Oh!  Motherfucker!  That was Tom Sizemore all the time? 
[03:19:00]  Oh yeah  Yeah it was  Yeah, that's Tom Sizemore from his sex tape  Oh!  Oh!  Motherfucker!  Isn't that great?  Tom Sizemore  Hey, is that Paris Hilton?

That clickety-clack bag of bones bitch  Fucking  Heidi  Heidi Fleiss  Yeah  Clickety-clack bag of bones bitch 
[03:19:30]  Oh!  Oh!  Motherfucker!  And this clip we're about to play is better than that  I, you know, it's definitely louder  Oh, definitely louder  This guy's been building up  I, you know, it's definitely better than that  I, you know, it's definitely better than that  I, you know, it's definitely better than that  I, you know, it's definitely better than that  I, you know, it's definitely better than that  I, you know, it's definitely better than that  I, you know, it's definitely better than that  I, you know, it's definitely better than that  I, you know, it's definitely better than that  I, you know, it's definitely better than that  I, you know, it's definitely better than that  I, you know, it's definitely better than that  I, you know, it's definitely better than that  I, you know, it's definitely better than that 
[03:20:00]  Holy crap. 
[03:20:30]  No, that's funny.  What the fuck is he?  That's like hydrochloric acid.  He's coming.  Or she's removing the orgasm from his testicles with a razor blade.  There's no way that is just basic sex coming.  I was thinking blockage.  I was thinking maybe crazy glue in the pee hole.  And he had a blasted through.  And it blew up like a balloon when you make a balloon animal.  He had a blasted through.  Coming inside of a balloon.  Oh!  Oh! 
[03:21:00]  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  That is...  Come on.  Get that on my machine.  Oh, yeah.  We need that on our machine.  And I need that right next to Tom Sizemore.  Oh, wow.  Frank smells bit.  Frank?  Hey.  Do you smell bit or what?  I smell bit, man.  You better do it.  What's the bit? 
[03:21:30]  The loudest orgasm.  Come on, guys.  But how are you going to beat that one?  I don't know, dude.  Someone...  What?  In theaters, Brokeback Mountain.  Come on.  All right.  We'll figure something out.  All right.  All right.  Let's say hi to Steve in Pennsylvania.  Steve?  Hey, that sounds like a New York City police precinct about five years ago.  Oh, jeez.  Going old school.  Oh, shit.  Chip the trucker. 
[03:22:00]  Chip?  Yeah, dude.  It sounds like somebody's trying to shove a telephone pole up his ass.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  You know what it is?  I wish I knew how to quit you.  You know what it is?  He got some Tabasco in his pee hole.  Oh! 
[03:22:30]  That wasn't pain, man.  No, I know.  I don't think that was inside.  That was just an inside one.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Yeah, passing a kidney stone, someone is suggesting. 
[03:23:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Wow, that's great.  All right, we'll be playing that a million times in the next few months.  Oh, yeah.  That's a show opener.  That's a show opener sound.  Oh, of course.  All right, the iPod porn story.  Yeah.  We got audio of that. 
[03:23:30]  We're looking to do this.  I want to do this.  Of course.  I want to be the next porn mogul.  How many porn moguls are out there?  People making money off of this shit.  And what do we do?  We give it away.  We just videotape it and do nothing.  As soon as I found out that you could, like, download these TV shows to your iPod and your phone and all that crap.  Yep.  I was thinking, screw Desperate Housewives.  They were bragging that you could get Desperate Housewives on your phone or your iPod.  I knew it was going to go right to the porn. 
[03:24:00]  Porno.  So here's the story.  Porn star Ron Jeremy has made movies for the big screen, for TV, VHS, DVD, and now for wireless gadgets such as cell phones and video iPods.  I think it'll spread a lot with word of mouth, you know, because, like, guys will go, hey, Louie, look at this.  Look what I got over here.  Jeremy does not think wireless porn will be a huge business, but scores of other pornographers certainly do, including Harvey Kaplan, who's been peddling net porn for seven years.  I think that the multi-billion dollar marketplace is just starting to peak. 
[03:24:30]  Over the next two years or so, you'll probably see about 2,000% increase in the amount of traffic going over cellular phones.  And it's got to be the freaky porn.  It's got to be the freaky porn.  Something you don't see every day where you can go, hey, dude, check this out.  Something that wraps up quickly.  Then it has that viral effect, that virus, like, you just want to, you know, pass it on to everybody, you know.  Here's what the video iPods are good for.  It's not good for a TV show, first of all. 
[03:25:00]  I'm sorry, the screen's a little too small to be sitting there.  You can't watch it while you're driving.  On the train, again, the screen's a little small, things like that.  It's almost like carrying around a little bit of porno with you.  A magazine, some pictures.  Remember the old days?  Hey, check out these pictures.  It says, how about, how about, 23 skidoo?  And they show, like, old pictures to each other.  It's that in video.  So now you can show your buddy, like, you know, check this fucking, maybe that scene that we just heard audio from. 
[03:25:30]  You bring that to work.  You go to your buddy, dude, check this out.  And it's funny.  It's quick.  It's a clip.  It's porno.  You can't get it on television.  That is where it's going to be a gold mine.  Porno has never taken a dip.  It's just a new place to go.  Because, okay, right now, I don't, you guys ain't that filthy, but I'm at the level where porn is almost finished.  You know, I'm almost reverting back to cartoons.  You know what I mean?  It's just done.  But there's a kid out there, 12, like I was once. 
[03:26:00]  Oh, yeah.  Who was looking at the fucking Victoria's Secret magazine and jerking off to that without even pussy, without even titty showing.  And they're going to build up, it's just, they're going to put it now on their iPod where they get to see their little, whatever they watch.  And it's going to build, it's that, their new market, their VHS, what VHS is to me watching porno is the iPod to them.  Oh, yeah.  Where you used to pop the tape in.  That's what it's going to be, man.  And did you ever watch the whole fucking porno?  You don't watch the whole thing. 
[03:26:30]  I am a porno, like I watch it, I know the actors, I know who changed, I know what their tendencies were, I know who the stars were, I know when they started to fall.  I'd watch, I'd fast forward, I'd look, I'd wait until I find a scene that I could jack off to.  That's it.  You know what changed about porn big now?  What people don't notice?  It used to be a famous woman, Vanessa Del Rio, behind the Marine chambers, fucking five, who the fuck are these guys? 
[03:27:00]  Now it's one guy fucking five, who the fuck are these girls?  Really?  You know the guys, you don't know the fucking girls.  So weird.  Six non, who the fuck are these women?  Jenna Jameson's the last porno star.  Like girls like her wouldn't fuck black guys in the pornos, it's just known.  Big time white fuck stars, they wouldn't do it.  Now they got these little, you know, swap girls too, and you know, come eyes.  Come eyes.  Well that's the problem with all the girls getting into porno now too, they all think they could be the next Jenna Jameson. 
[03:27:30]  No.  But that has, you're so right, that has passed them by.  No names anymore.  It's like, I know the guys names, and I'm not being a fag, but it's like, you know, Rocco and whatever the fuck, who are all these guys, you can just know if I can think about them.  But they're just, they're out there, and these girls, it's like, oh, she's a cute little, this is a cute one.  Then when you see her in the next one, you go, ah, seen this bitch.  I want to see, I want to see, you know, ouch nigga too, and I want to see different bitches. 
[03:28:00]  Ouch nigga.  You know what I'm saying?  I don't want to see this girl again.  It used to be, I got a bunch of Vanessa Del Rios.  Yeah.  And who's this guy fucking to move his ass out the way?  Now it's one dude in different scenes.  It changed, and there's no more porn stars anymore.  I wouldn't know that.  I just get to a good point, and jacket, done, and then I was, yeah, put it back in the case, and that's it.  It was done.  All right, let's, we have one more clip. 
[03:28:30]  And that's what these video iPod and stuff are going to be good for.  You download a quick clip.  Now you can jack.  Maybe you want to get the, you're in school jack.  Maybe you want to do the at work jack.  But you can't smuggle in a penthouse or something like that, like the old days.  Now you just pull out your video iPod.  You're looking.  Now you're in the bathroom stall.  Quick clip.  Quick jack.  You're relaxed.  Pretending you listen to music.  You're more productive.  Right.  There at the office.  There you go.  You'll just collect your favorite jack clips. 
[03:29:00]  Jack clips.  That's it.  That's the whole fucking thing.  Jackclips.com.  I'm registering it right now.  Has your jacking elevated?  Have you, are you a different jacker than you was when you were maybe 10 years ago?  Do you even remember your...  I don't even jack anymore.  You don't jack anymore?  Nope.  What was your favorite jack sauce back in the day?  Jack sauce.  Jack sauce.  Like your, uh...  Your favorite moisturizer.  Uh, in the old days, it's nothing but Vaseline around the house. 
[03:29:30]  I couldn't, when I was a kid, I couldn't leave shit around the house.  K.Y.  What am I going to leave?  Fucking Aqualube.  There was nothing around there.  It was whatever.  It was laying around the house.  Fucking Vaseline intensive care lotion.  You still jacking now?  Uh, no.  I do, uh, fucking.  You're not a jacker.  No, I kind of just...  I used to be a big jacker.  I'm not jacking anymore.  You're not jacking anymore.  Not at all.  When's the last jack?  And I used to admit it.  Jesus, dude, we're running out of show, and now you come by?  Who's that?  Pepper from Corrosion Conformity.  Ah!  What the hell happened to you, dude?  We got like four minutes left in the show. 
[03:30:00]  Wow.  This is not my fault.  Uh-oh.  We got Pepper.  Holy shit, Pepper.  We got Pepper from Corrosion Conformity.  Sit there for one second.  I got to play a 20-second clip here from a family group that's concerned about the iPod porn.  According to one industry estimate, worldwide mobile porn sales will total a billion dollars  this year, a more than 50% increase over last year, worrying some family groups.  Because you can monitor what your own child downloads off the Internet, but with these new 
[03:30:30]  mobile devices, you don't have any control over what your child might see or might be exposed  to from the child who's sitting next to them in the box.  Anti-pornography activists are urging the government to crack down and warning parents  to be vigilant.  Good luck.  Warning parents to be vigilant.  Good luck.  Good luck with that.  God damn it, someone's got jackclips.com.  Really?  Any domain name you could think of, someone's got it.  They figured them all out.  Pepper from Corrosion Conformity in studio. 
[03:31:00]  Pepper.  Sorry, guys.  What's up, bro?  What happened?  Literally, traffic.  Yeah.  That's a lot.  You said Christmas traffic, right?  I was shopping.  Yeah, yeah.  It was tough crossing the street.  I got held up at F.A. Hill Schwartz.  Guy's doing a show.  Yeah.  Does someone like you go Christmas shopping?  No.  No.  No.  But you got to buy it for somebody, right?  Kwanzaa shopping.  Is that it?  Kwanzaa? 
[03:31:30]  Yeah.  Celebrating Kwanzaa, that made-up fucking Christmas.  Now, this is a fucking rocker.  You think you're going to hear any goddamn Jewish jargon from this guy?  Fuck's no, man.  You're getting no Israeli, Palestinian.  No Israeli.  The whole time I was driving over here, we drove past the building where I know the NFL  commission stays at.  Yeah.  And I need to speak to Paul Tagliabue.  Why?  Because the New Orleans Saints are getting screwed.  Why are they getting screwed?  They're getting tossed out of there. 
[03:32:00]  They're going to San Antonio or some horse shit.  Well, they can't quite play, you know.  I know.  You can't hit me over the head when I'm already in the gutter.  Can't play in the shit dome.  Yeah, they don't even have a dome to play in.  Do you take the Saints out of a major city like that?  Until you guys...  Yeah.  You guys need...  Until what?  It's gone.  You guys need a few years to rebuild.  Is that what you think?  Yeah.  Then we'll get you a football team again.  Can we get a new team?  You're going to get a new team.  I'm telling you.  Is everything going down?  Give it two or three years and then the NFL is going to do the right thing. 
[03:32:30]  I can hang with that.  A hurricane.  If it's on paper.  It's got to be written down.  Did we know you were from New Orleans?  Yeah.  Yeah, we did.  You called me during the hurricane.  I was in a horse trailer when you called me.  I was living in a horse trailer.  How'd that work out for you?  Housewise, everything fine?  Terrible.  Really?  Did you get fucked?  Terrible.  Terrible.  Your house flooded?  Gone?  What happened?  He lost his house, my friend Ross.  Really?  Yeah.  That shit's a bitch. 
[03:33:00]  Of course it was bad.  We saw it.  Insurance take care of it or what?  We had an adjuster come out.  Yeah?  Exactly.  Nothing.  Nothing.  He adjusted himself and left.  I have an hour in a bar in New Orleans and I was insured by Lloyd's of London.  And I had an adjuster come out.  Yeah.  What did he say?  Didn't he give me some fucking money?  He gave me not even numbers, Hoss.  You say give me money, bitch. 
[03:33:30]  I've been paying you.  It's coming, Hoss.  What's wrong with you, Hoss?  I've been paying you the premiums.  Now you fucking, you gotta pay off.  Sorry, you lost the bet.  Exactly.  I pay you premiums.  If nothing happens, you win.  So what did they do?  If my house gets fucking flooded.  That's what I was thinking.  They ran away?  Isn't that how insurance is supposed to work?  I don't think anybody's gotten paid out yet.  Right.  God damn.  So what do you do?  You just stay away from New Orleans?  No, I'm going home.  Hell no.  Did you get your ATM card?  I can bang a nail.  The $200 to $2,000 ATM card?  Yeah, did you get one of those? 
[03:34:00]  From the Red Cross?  Giving the Red Cross cards.  No.  You know, when I did go back to New Orleans, I enjoyed seeing people with the Red Cross cards.  Yeah.  Like, people who went to L.A. and got them.  Buying, like, stockings and shit.  Yeah, well, you need the essentials.  Right.  Terrible.  How are the shows going, man?  Yeah, it's good.  We're almost done.  Yeah.  I gotta tell you, my only concern is to get back to New Orleans.  That's it.  Is that it?  Chomping at the bit there to get back home. 
[03:34:30]  And rebuild, right?  Are you actually going to get in there, get your hands dirty, do some fucking building?  My hands have been dirty.  Yeah?  Pick up a hammer and nails?  Oh, totally.  Right before I left, it was like, I was almost having my grandfather's roof gone.  What was wrong with the roof?  Hole cut in it?  Gone.  Just blown away?  Yes.  Was there more wind or water damage, or both?  You know, if there wasn't any water damage, it would have been, like, nothing. 
[03:35:00]  CNN thing, like, maybe a two-week story.  Yeah.  But the flood fucked it up.  And you were in, your house was in one of those areas that got flooded?  Yeah, 80% of New Orleans is underwater.  Yeah.  Well.  There's not much difference between two feet and four feet.  You know?  That's true.  It's going to fuck it up.  Gee.  That's wild, man.  Man.  I'm tired of bitching about it, but because I'm with you guys.  Yeah, you got it.  This is my one little...  You could vent, my friend.  Yes.  It's messed up.  It's America.  That's what's weird, you know? 
[03:35:30]  It's New Orleans.  Yeah.  New Orleans is older than America.  Yeah.  And we're fucking being tossed out in the trash.  You think the government could help a lot more than they are?  Based upon me being down there, I mean, you still got to wear a mask.  It's so dusty.  There's so much trash on the street.  Really?  Still?  Do you see anything?  Has anything changed?  Like, you look and go, wow, it's nice to see they did this.  If it was Charlotte, North Carolina, or if it was Nashville, or whatever, some major city 
[03:36:00]  about our size.  Yeah.  With a different, maybe, population, I think it'd be a hell of a lot different.  Do you see anything changed, though?  There's no schools open, man.  Nothing.  Where you went?  There's no public schools open.  Last time, this was all fucked up, but now, at least, that's getting fixed, or it's still  just a filthy mess.  It's been eradicated, man.  It's eradicated.  See, we thought it was doing better because it's off the tube.  Yeah, it gets off the tube.  Exactly.  I'm not even kidding with you, man. 
[03:36:30]  I'm on the road.  I'm like, all right, they're not doing stories anymore.  I guess they got it under control, and they're rebuilding.  It sucks, but it's moving in the right direction.  You try and go to a restaurant, for instance, a nice restaurant, and you got to go get your own  water because there's no waitstaff.  Seriously.  You got to walk up, and they have water set up on the counter.  Holy shit.  There's nobody there.  You know?  It's insane.  It's like a ghost town.  It's a shanty town.  It's like being in Kingston, Jamaica.  Wow. 
[03:37:00]  Seriously.  See?  Who knows?  You don't see any.  Who knows?  You don't see it.  Are you going to be around tomorrow?  No.  Where'd Geraldo go?  Is Geraldo coming here?  No, Geraldo, why isn't he down there doing that story?  He was very concerned for a while.  So he's gone.  Now you know where he went?  He went back to Iraq because of the violence.  Hey, let me tell you this, too.  You know what I think's going down?  Uh-oh.  What's up?  I think the Red Cross is funneling money out of the New Orleans thing to fucking Iraq.  Are you shitting me?  That's what I think is going down.  To where? 
[03:37:30]  Like, what part of?  Whatever's needed in Iraq is where it's going to.  Wow.  We're running out of show.  They're going to turn this off.  God damn it.  20 seconds.  How many seconds?  20 seconds.  It's Pepper from Corrosion of Conformity.  Pepper, you've got to get back here again.  Please help rebuild New Orleans.  All right.  He got here early.  I love you guys to death.  And we're going to be at J&R Music World downtown at, what, 23 Park Row, across from City Hall Park, starting at 1230.  We've got a pair of tickets to the show tonight.  Give us a call right now.  Corrosion of Conformity and Disturbed at the Nokia Theater, the J√§germeister Music Tour. 
[03:38:00]  Thanks, Pepper.  Later, man.  I'm out of here. </pre>
