<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast was a tribute to their recently deceased producer, Steve Carlisi ("Steve C.").  The show opened with a clip from Steve's first day back at XM Satellite Radio in 2004, where the hosts jokingly referred to their staff as "a bunch of alcoholics," setting the tone for numerous anecdotes about Steve's drinking habits, including a story about being cut off in Boston and throwing a bowling ball through a wall.  His physique was described as having an "old change purse stomach" or "shot glass stomach," and his nickname "Martini Steve" was established.  His unofficial website, foundrymusic.com, was also mentioned.

A large portion focused on "Ramon," a fictional, crude, and absurd houseboy character created by Steve, with several audio clips of Ramon skits played.  Steve's acting skills, or lack thereof, were then examined, including clips of a skit with an intern, "Wild Bill," showcasing his comedically bad performance.  Studio guests Brian Cox, Tobin Bell, and Shawnee Smith (promoting a *Saw* movie) offered their perspectives on Steve's acting, contrasting it with their professional experience.

Numerous callers and former colleagues, including a program director from WNEW and "Black Earl," shared memories and expressed their sadness, highlighting Steve's dedication and friendship.  A website, tinyurl.com/stevecfun, was provided for donations to Steve's family.  The hosts also described Steve as a "warm, sweet guy" despite his gruff exterior, mentioning he left behind a wife, a two-year-old, and a teenage stepdaughter.

The show detailed Steve's misguided attempt to connect with Corey Delaney, an Australian known for a notorious house party, involving a fake MySpace profile and a humorous phone call with the wrong person. A Steve Carlisi catchphrase was also mentioned (though not specifically stated).  Further audio clips from past broadcasts were played, featuring bits about Steve's Prius breaking down despite his boasts about its fuel efficiency, and calls from people impersonating deceased celebrities (Amelia Earhart, Elvis Presley, D.B. Cooper, Osama bin Laden). Many callers shared memories, emphasizing Steve's loyalty and kindness.

Sam Roberts, Don Wickland, and A-Rock joined Opie and Anthony, sharing their own anecdotes. Roberts recounted Steve's mentorship, Wickland spoke about Steve's dedication and family happiness, and A-Rock played music from Steve's band, Foundry, including "Pendulum," leading to a discussion about the band name, Steve's stage persona ("Stephen Carr"), and the song's lyrics.  The hosts also commented on Steve's clothing style, particularly his habit of tucking in his shirts.  The segment also included visual elements featuring Steve.  Ron and Fez, along with other former staff members, also called in with tributes. The show concluded with further calls and tributes to Steve, and ended with Rascal Flatts' "I'm Moving On."  A fundraising link for Steve's family was repeatedly mentioned throughout the broadcast.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  The O.P. Anthony Show remembers friend and producer Steve Carlisi.  Hello, my name is E-Rock and welcome to the Steve Carlisi Tribute Special.  For those of you who don't know, you should know at this point if you are a regular listener to the show,  but our old producer and friend Steve Carlisi recently passed away.  Now, it was very unexpected and shocking to everybody, not just his family and friends,  but to those of us here on the show, and based on all the emails, the tweets, and phone calls that we got from you, the listeners, 
[00:00:30]  it affected you as well, so we thought we got to do something to honor the memory of our good pal Steve C., as you may know him on the air.  So we put this little thing together.  It's going to feature a whole bunch of stuff that explores the history of Steve with this show,  from his character traits to stupid things that he's said on the air or off the air,  personal interests, his choice in music, a whole bunch of stuff we're going to go through here.  Plus, we're going to have some testimonials from people who've worked with Steve in various capacities, 
[00:01:00]  like at WNEW, at CVS K-Rock, at XM, at SiriusXM.  So let's get started here and plow through all this the best that we possibly can.  We'll start off with the first show that we did on XM Satellite Radio back in October of 2004,  where Steve was announced as a returning member of the Opie and Anthony show in a producer capacity,  where he was the production guy back at CBS WNEW. 
[00:01:30]  Here it is.  We have a bunch of degenerates now working for us.  We were supposed to upgrade our staff.  We had two years to try to upgrade and fill in the dead spots,  and I really believe we effed up bad.  We've got a bunch of alcoholics working behind the scenes now.  Well, if the little publicity tour we've been taking over the past month or two months or whatever,  if that's any indication, we're in serious trouble.  Yeah.  Serious trouble.  Because I have never seen so many drunks in my life. 
[00:02:00]  I've got to say, Steve, Steve, see, he, um...  Wait a minute.  You could just talk from in there?  Oh, yeah, now I can.  Oh, there he goes.  There we go.  Wait, now we can't hear him.  What?  No, you can't hear this.  I can't hear him in my headphones.  Ooh, ooh, ooh, he reminds me of somebody back there.  How about now?  Steve, get in here.  You're not landing a plane.  Thank God.  He's behind the glass.  He's already too comfortable.  He just needs a martini.  Do we have the martini Steve music yet? 
[00:02:30]  Dylan!  That's all we got?  Pretty much it.  That's all we're working with.  People get to pay for this crap?  Dylan!  We need a few more sound bites before people go, you know what?  I'd pay for the Opie and Anthony show.  I know.  What's up, Steve?  Have you slept in the last three days?  A little bit.  I went to bed around midnight last night.  I woke up at three.  Right.  Well, here's the second member of the Opie and Anthony show.  Old change purse stomach.  Yeah.  And Steve, who was running foundrymusic.com, continues to run that. 
[00:03:00]  The unofficial Opie and Anthony website is now officially a member of the Opie and Anthony  show.  Yeah.  He was allowed to stay at WNEW when we all got fired because he was never an official  member of the show.  Right.  Yeah, they didn't fire him, which is weird.  He had a lot to do with the program.  I think they just didn't have a clue.  No, I think in the back of their minds they knew they just didn't have a really good reason  to get rid of me.  Ooh, fire the commercial guy.  Well, why?  How about you were associated with this program?  Well, I was waiting for a good year after that and through all maybe two format changes 
[00:03:30]  at that point, I was waiting to get axed and they never did it.  Yeah.  I was just, you know, I was lucky.  I sort of like, I was Teflon, never really moved.  And my salary was so not, you know, minimal that it never really showed up on the radar.  So like, all right, you know.  Well, they had to pay Opie and I, so nobody else got any money.  Exactly.  Yeah, we're going to get into that a little bit later, I think.  But we want to introduce everyone.  But Steve has taken it to the limit on the road.  A few times.  Just once or twice.  Every city we were at.  First of all, to get cut off in Boston. 
[00:04:00]  He got cut off?  Yeah.  When was this?  You have to be so drunk.  You were cut off in Boston.  Oh, at the bowling alley?  No.  No, no, no.  At the bowling alley, you threw a bowling ball off the wall.  At the, into the wall and got yelled at.  Oh, that I remember, yeah.  And we all decided to go bowling.  Well, that's just because I'm a crappy bowler.  That has nothing to do with being drunk.  That's just, I didn't know how to let go of the ball.  You hit the wall.  How bad of a bowler are you?  You hit the wall.  And it's a nice bowling alley.  It's not one of these pieces of crap places.  No, it was very nice.  I didn't want, that was actually, I was aware of that. 
[00:04:30]  I just didn't, I couldn't let go of the ball in time and sort of bounced.  As long as I don't have to comfort you anymore.  No.  On the sidewalk.  No, no more of that.  What a prick.  Oh my goodness.  That's all I'm saying.  All right.  I was having a bad night.  It was a bad day.  Yeah, but I don't know.  No more of that.  I'm only 160 pounds.  I shouldn't be consoling.  How much do you weigh?  Now 260.  I shouldn't be consoling 260 pound men.  No.  No.  Never.  Never again.  Ever.  Let's stay privacy here on bedroom. 
[00:05:00]  No, never again.  That was just, that was an isolated incident.  Never again.  Wouldn't it be as bad if you didn't have your pants pulled up to mid-waist with your shirt  tucked in like some kind of a weighty, brawny creep?  What are you talking, who are you looking at?  It's just awful the way you just tuck your shirt in so nice and neatly.  You have to stop that.  Let it hang out and live a little.  We can't, you know, I'm sorry, we can't all let it hang over the, let the gut hang over  the pants.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, very good.  All right.  So he's back at him.  So Steve is an official member of the Opie and Anthony Show now? 
[00:05:30]  Yeah.  The Opie and Anthony Show remembers friend and producer Steve Carlesi.  Remembering our old friend Steve Carlesi, this segment here, for those of you who are  long-term listeners of the fans, as they would say, linger longer.  Steve used to go by the nickname Martini Steve.  It's not a nickname that he gave himself, but one that the show sort of just forced upon  him.  And like everything on this show, all it takes is one little thing to be said on the air, 
[00:06:00]  and you're labeled with that nickname for the rest of your term with the show, even  when you leave the show.  So this is the origin of Martini Steve.  Get Steve in here, because he's so pissed off at some of the contestants.  He wants to kick out girls that are so hot it's not even funny.  It's not their fault that they were smart enough to figure crap out.  Well, we realize Steve does hate the listeners.  He hates the people that listen to this program.  He hates the people that go to his website.  He hates himself.  He hates himself.  He's just a hater. 
[00:06:30]  He's a hater.  He hates his tiny little shot glass stomach.  Oh, he hates that little nutshell stomach.  I see if Foundry Four Lane can come in here.  Steve, now look at Andrew Dice Clay from Fourth Fair Lane.  Yeah, yeah.  I went a little nuts for that.  Oh, did I see Four Lane?  Four Lane.  Yeah, you screwed up five times.  I screwed up twice, but who's keeping track?  Foundry Four Lane.  Oh, God, you did say that.  I knew what you meant.  It's Martini Steve, everyone, who hates everyone.  Foundry Four Lane, including himself. 
[00:07:00]  There was one point Steve and Scott were telling me in the back office that they were both looking at the voting screen with their hands, you know, folded, all pissed off because they see the girls cheating.  Yeah.  They are watching them cheat.  All the other girls would get a vote here like click, click, click.  No big deal, you know?  Right.  Kind of a normal voting pattern, right?  There were some girls, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, getting hundreds of votes per minute.  Oh, really?  Yeah, it was a little bit ridiculous.  You could just see their vote totals going up by the hundreds.  Tally.  Cheating. 
[00:07:30]  We thought they could handle this on their own.  Yeah.  We thought we could trust you guys while we were away.  We didn't think we had to be here every day looking in.  Don't make us get the nanny cam.  We'll get a nanny cam and keep it on you people when we're away.  How are we supposed to trust you next time we go away?  How are we supposed to trust leaving you alone like this?  Joel.  So we're going to figure it out.  I think we're going to need another day to post the top 20, though.  Okay.  They're cheating on voting and they're driving the Porsche into the water. 
[00:08:00]  No, they didn't drive it.  The brake wasn't on.  Oh, they drove it there and they weren't supposed to be driving it.  But then the brake wasn't on.  Right.  So it rolled back into the water.  His fault.  Vote.  Bada, bada, bada, bada, bada, vote.  Bada, bada, bada, bada, vote.  All I know is Tangerine Dream was playing all over this place while we were gone.  Steve C. came sliding out in his underwear, playing air guitar.  I look good in underwear now.  Martini Steve.  Martini Steve.  Can your little shot glass stomach handle the olive when you have a martini? 
[00:08:30]  He draws a martini glass for us.  With the little olive stuff in his stomach.  Tilted sideways.  Hello.  That's like a buffet for you.  It is.  A little olive.  It is.  Three olives, actually.  Dirty martini with kettle one vodka.  Very, very good stuff.  You hate the listeners, right?  Why don't you admit it?  You hate the listeners.  You hate the people that go to your website.  You just hate all the people.  Most of them, yeah.  But it's okay because you hate yourself.  Yeah, I'm not a big fan of myself either.  I hate myself.  My hate is all-consuming.  I'm not sitting here on a throne loving myself and hating everybody else. 
[00:09:00]  If he could, he would cover his entire body with a tattoo.  Yeah.  Self-loathing.  I can't do my flesh because I despise myself so much.  Just change yourself in any way, shape, or form that is available.  You ever find yourself having an M&M and just binging?  No, I can't do sugar.  It might have been funnier if I didn't save an M&M.  I didn't sleep at all.  Thank you, Martini Steve.  Martini Steve now.  Talking about the top 20 Canadian rock groups of all time.  We'll let you guess the number one, but let's get through the mess here. 
[00:09:30]  That is the bottom half of the top 20.  15th place, the band Trooper.  Trooper.  What was their one hit?  Remember Trooper?  Didn't they have a hit in the United States?  No, who would know is Martini Steve.  Might have to get Martini Steve.  Martini Steve.  We need some, like, Dean Martin music for him when he comes in.  We can almost use the Austin Powers thing.  Some kind of, you think?  The walk-on music.  Yeah, Martini Steve dancing down the hallway. 
[00:10:00]  Dancing his way from one studio to the other.  With this martini glass.  Old change purse belly.  Those little rubber ones with the slit in it.  Just enough for four quarters.  Martini Steve's now walking down the hall.  Where's Martini Steve?  Here he comes, Anthony.  Get the music.  Get the music.  Jack J.  Yeah.  Oh, wait.  He just made a detour into the bathroom.  Where'd he go? 
[00:10:30]  Did he have to throw up lunch?  Here he comes.  Yeah, Martini Steve.  Martini Steve.  Steve?  Yeah, what's up?  We're doing the top 20 Canadian records of all time, and in 15th place is the band Trooper,  and we need to know what their U.S. hit was.  Trooper.  Trooper?  I think we'll, oh, crap.  Do you know?  No, I don't.  I don't even know.  All right, thank you, Steve.  You're welcome.  Thank you.  There goes Steve back to his studio, Anthony.  Trooper.  There goes Steve back to his studio.  Oh, he's leaving.  There you go. 
[00:11:00]  Martini Steve.  We're reinventing his character live in our show.  Can't have the same old characters.  I'm, um.  You like looking at people's cards, Martini Steve?  Yes.  What do we, we just, we just take the same people and give them their names.  Well, that's what wrestling does.  That's all we do here.  It's now Martini Steve.  It's Martini Steve.  It's Martini Steve.  It's Martini Steve. 
[00:11:30]  The O.P. and Anthony Show remembers Steve C.  Hey, what's up?  It's Garrett.  It's Dinky.  I, uh, worked with Steve during the WNEW days.  And what I'll remember about Steve is he was, like, the best friend of the show.  No matter who was working on the show, you could always go to Steve  with your problems, and he was always there. 
[00:12:00]  And he was always there just helping out the show, filming everything, putting it up on  the website, making production.  He was just, his whole life was about the show.  And it showed.  And he was awesome at what he did.  And he's going to be missed.  So, I'll miss you, Steve.  See you later.  Remembering our good friend Steve Carlesi in this segment here, Steve was known best for 
[00:12:30]  his production.  He came up with some really insane, idiotic stuff and some things that just made you laugh  for no reason other than Steve was out of his fucking mind.  And in this segment here, we explore Ramon.  Ramon was one of the first creations that Steve came up with when we joined XM Satellite  Radio.  Steve was trying to go a little bit outside of the box of typical radio production and 
[00:13:00]  tried to come up with some clever, unique things that would really stand out.  This happens to be one of them that a lot of people still remember to this day.  This is the story of Ramon, and immediately following right after that is a montage of  all the Ramon production that Steve did.  And I hope you enjoy this as much as Steve did, spent countless hours giggling and laughing  to himself in a room with no windows, putting all this together for his own enjoyment.  Here is Ramon.  What's up with you and your imaginary friend, Ramon? 
[00:13:30]  He's not my imaginary friend.  He's just the...  Did you make him up?  Yeah, I did.  He's yours.  He's my creation.  I'll certainly take credit for that, but Ramon is the byproduct of something I learned  when I was working at NEW.  They told me that a lot of the deep voice guys, they do voiceover for movies and for TV.  Check this out.  Listen, this is...  The explanation.  No, this is...  Here's the explanation.  This is exactly where it came from. 
[00:14:00]  They do a lot of their voiceover work from home, in a home studio on ISTN lines.  So a lot of them are just traipsing around home in their bathrobes or sweatpants, making  millions of dollars, mind you, doing voice work.  So you believe there's some guy walking around and his houseboy is there.  And he has a houseboy.  And as he's doing these voiceovers, sometimes things happen and he's got to go, Ramon...  Exactly.  So you feel like you're one of these big voice guys and you need a little houseboy.  Oh, no, no, no.  That's why I pitch my voice down, because I have to make it sound like it's not me. 
[00:14:30]  Right.  So...  Yeah, exactly.  So not only does he have an imaginary friend named Ramon, he has an imaginary him.  Oh, this is not going well.  Did you just call from Jersey two minutes ago?  Well, you think way too much into this.  No, this is how you...  I sit in a room with no windows, mind you, for hours on end, so sometimes you're...  What's the profile of Ramon?  What kind of person is he?  Well, that's interesting.  Is he short?  Because I brought this up with Nathaniel and Danny yesterday, and they each have a different  visualization for what Ramon looks like. 
[00:15:00]  Really?  All right, get those guys in here.  Danny said, I think he looked something like the other intern.  But then Nathaniel had a totally different look for what Ramon might have looked like.  Is Ramon with you right now?  No, Ramon is not in the room.  Can you channel Ramon?  No, because you'll never hear from Ramon.  You'll only hear Ramon being referenced.  You do hear from Ramon, Steve's not here right now, Mrs. Tarrant.  Ramon is the little boy who lives in my mouth.  Is Ramon your Jenny Piccolo? 
[00:15:30]  It's a friend that we'll just never see.  It was Jenny Piccolo, right, from Happy Day?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Ramon will, yeah, well, kind of.  Ramon will never be referenced in the first person.  You'll never hear, like, you know, a little voice pop up and go, yes, sir.  You'll never hear that.  You will only hear Ramon being referenced as, like, he's being addressed, or in the third  person.  Do you want him to talk, but, you know, he's not as opposed to?  No, it's good.  You like ice cream, Ramon?  Do you want to secretly be Ramon? 
[00:16:00]  Oh, no, no, no.  Ramon's a house boy.  Yeah.  Ramon's a house.  You don't aspire to be Ramon.  I'm thinking you might want to be a house boy.  No.  Kind of like where someone tells you what to do.  I'll bet you in his mind, Ramon is probably 5'10", very svelte, smooth abs, unclipped,  hung 10, fat, doesn't speak English, willing to do anything for a buck.  Is that who Ramon is?  Ramon.  How many Ramon promos are there?  Honestly, I'm thinking there could be a series of Ramon.  Of course there will be.  When do you think maybe we should take Ramon to the doctor? 
[00:16:30]  All right.  If Derek's ready, let's hear the Ramon promo, Anthony.  All right.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony.  Ooh, it's in my shoes.  Ramon, clean this up.  It's a little weird, Steve.  Of course it is.  Your house boy's got to clean the crap out of your shoes.  Do you pay them well, at least?  No, house boys generally don't get paid well.  You're not making a lot of money?  No.  I mean, let's say maybe he's Guatemalan. 
[00:17:00]  Maybe he's uneducated.  You do great production for the radio show, but I've got to tell you, it's a little weird.  The Ramon thing.  Why does Ramon have to do everything for you?  Because, well, it's not, it's also, it's not me, but Ramon is a house boy assigned to  the menial tasks that this deep voice guy does not feel that he's...  I have a problem.  What?  Why is Ramon with you?  Yeah.  Say there's a menial task that has to be, that has to be, that has to be taken care of.  Yeah, road ahead.  Yeah, exactly.  Your mule is dirty, needs to be cleaned. 
[00:17:30]  Ramon, lap this up.  Perfect example.  You go to a self-serve gas station.  Do you think this guy, this wealthy voiceover artist is going to be...  Ramon, top off my tank.  Yeah.  Right.  Exactly.  You're a couple weeks away from coming in here with a scarf.  You know, I'm thinking that this guy has, you know, almost a heft outfit, like a, like  a, not a leisure suit, what's it called?  An ascot and a smoking jacket.  Thank you.  Now, how does Ramon feel?  Is Ramon...  Does it matter how Ramon feels?  Angry at the guy? 
[00:18:00]  Ramon could be angry.  He might be bitter.  He might be bitter.  Crazy.  By the way.  Crazy Steve.  You have thought about this way too long.  There's a profile on your imaginary friend, Ramon.  Yeah.  Behind his back, does he like...  Are you, or the person that you're voicing in these spots, that's not Ramon, obviously,  is he married?  No.  No, actually, you know what?  You know, now that I think of it, there are two, two of the little cartoons on the website 
[00:18:30]  are pretty representative of what this deep voice guy and Ramon might look like.  Like, like, like...  And Ramon is...  I suck.  Ramon is a very short, or potentially very short pygmy.  I don't want to alter it too much.  Yeah, because I don't want to alter it.  Let people imagine their own Ramon.  Ramon should be, you know...  Everyone should have their own Ramon.  Should people start sending in maybe drawings and cartoons of what they think you and Ramon  are...  I think, I think that's a great idea. 
[00:19:00]  Are like and look like.  There's some talented artists out there.  Has Ramon ever stood there and just thrown firecrackers while other people were preparing  to rob the house?  Boogie and I, he's right now.  Yeah.  Ramon, that is a typical Ramon.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, the guy throwing the firecrackers around the house.  All right, well...  Yeah, that's a Ramon.  Ramon takes care of the menial tasks that you can't be bothered with because, you know,  you're off making the money and you can pay somebody, you know, you know, three bucks  an hour to go and clean up diarrhea.  Really, for a casual thing, you have his salary already worked out.  Yeah.  How much does he make? 
[00:19:30]  Does he live for free in like the, uh...  Well...  In the, uh, that, what do they call it?  That other house?  Servant's quarters.  You know?  The pool house?  Like the pool house or something?  Yeah, he could potentially.  He could potentially.  You know, you've got to remember, he's, you know, he maybe doesn't have a great grasp of  the English language.  Ha ha ha.  You know, he's from Central America.  Um, you know, uneducated.  And no grasp of U.S. law as well.  I didn't say he was underage.  I didn't say he was...  Oh, no, no.  I didn't say he was underage.  You weren't saying that.  It's a deep voice guy with a little helper named Ramon. 
[00:20:00]  Sure.  Jesus.  Yeah.  No, that's...  Danny.  You've got like a guy with a pith helmet.  Yeah.  Like an old, uh...  Oh, ho.  Yeah, exactly.  An old adventurer.  Yeah.  With the optic thing.  Yeah, he's got a monocle.  Oh, monocle, thank you.  And like a pith helmet and binoculars.  Mm-hmm.  His name is actually Colonel Wetpants.  Yeah, Colonel with like the, uh...  Colonel with like the little handlebar mustache thing going like,  Well, there I was.  Yeah, exactly.  It's Africa elephant hunting when all of the sudden Ramon came over. 
[00:20:30]  And then Ramon is a black guy.  And he's a pygmy with a bone through his nose and in his hair.  With a big afro and like bracelets of bone.  Almost like a shorter LeVar Burton type.  So Ramon's not black.  No, I don't see Ramon as being black.  No, I mean, but that's, you know...  I see Ramon as...  That's why I was kind of making a reference.  Yeah, Central American, maybe.  Maybe now.  Maybe even Mexican.  Hairless.  I see Ramon as hairless.  See?  You know, there's...  Now we've got a completely different representation of Ramon. 
[00:21:00]  You see a very hairy Ramon.  Of course you do, Steve.  Do you really?  No.  A mini bear.  All Ramon can say in English is sweet and cozy.  Cozy face.  All right.  Well, thank you, Steve.  We just...  Anthony and I just noticed this whole Ramon thing that was kind of taken on a life of its own.  And we had to kind of...  I thought you guys liked the Ramon things.  We do.  Oh, okay.  And now they're even better now that we have the backstory. 
[00:21:30]  Are you kidding me?  Of course.  Who's not going to be paying attention to the Ramon promos?  And everyone's going to be looking forward to the next one in the series.  Okey-dokey.  Ramon.  Golfing is a wonderful way to spend an afternoon.  A true test of dexterity, skill, and...  Oh, seems to have landed in some dog mess.  Oh, not again.  Ramon.  Wash my balls.  Sweet oral pleasure. 
[00:22:00]  Such a talented little heroin addict.  Oh, no, no...  Oh, dear.  Overdose.  Ramon.  Get the wood chipper.  There is nothing quite like a Cuban cigar.  Right, Ramon?  The rich texture.  The full flavor.  So relaxing.  Oh, fiddlesticks.  No ashtray. 
[00:22:30]  Ramon.  Open your mouth.  Ah, an exquisite day for mailbox baseball.  Oh, need a mint.  Oh, my.  Ramon.  Scoop up these puppy guts.  And now, another holiday reading from Charles Dickens' immortal classic, A Christmas Carol. 
[00:23:00]  When Scrooge awoke, it was so dark that looking out of bed, he could see meddling carolers every bloody year.  Bah, humbug.  Ramon, fetch the nail gun.  State of the Union.  Gas prices going up again. 
[00:23:30]  The Opiate Anthony Show on XM.  Hoop goes the weasel.  Ramon.  Give me your sleeve.  Who doesn't love a nice dip in the tranquil blue ocean?  Oh, that looks like a dorsal fin.  Carcharidon carcareous, if I'm not mistaken.  One moment. 
[00:24:00]  Ramon.  Open your veins.  Trekking through the Himalayas is quite exhausting.  But the views are breathtaking.  So tired.  So famished.  Great Scott.  My Sherpa has collapsed.  Ramon.  Fillet this Chinaman.  I just love a drive in the country.  Laughing with Opie and Anthony. 
[00:24:30]  That plane is flying awfully low.  Don't you think, Ramon?  Ramon.  Ramon, call 911.  This local tavern appears to be quite festive.  It's a friendly bunch in here.  Seems to be mustache night.

[00:25:30]  Hello.  It's Jeremy Coleman.  I was the program director of WNEW back in the Opie and Anthony years.  And there was this guy, Steve Carlissi.  I remember we hired Steve to do a sort of pretty entry-level job.  He was supposed to come in and he was supposed to dub commercials so that we could play commercials on the radio.  And he was good at it.  But then whenever Opie and Anthony were on the air, he would stop.  You could not get a commercial produced to save your life while Opie and Anthony were on because he was working on his website for them with Foundry Music. 
[00:26:00]  He was paying attention to every single second of the show.  You could not find a guy more dedicated to what was happening on the Opie and Anthony show.  And I think things worked out rather well for Steve in that regard.  And he ended up working with the show.  And he was a great pleasure to work with, this big motorcycle rider kind of looking guy who was the sweetest guy you'd ever meet once you got to know him.  And so it's incredibly sad to hear what happened.  And my feelings go out to his family and everyone who knew Steve.  But I am grateful that there are some great memories of Steve Carlissi in this world. 
[00:26:30]  And we'll hold on to those.  The Opie and Anthony show remembers friend and producer Steve Carlissi.  And it is true.  Steve C., who worked with the show for, I don't know, at least 10 years, died.  And I'm sick about it.  Steve left behind a 2-year-old, a wife, and a stepdaughter who's 16 or 17, I believe.  To donate to Steve's family, it's tinyurl.com slash stevecfun.  If you can give, great.  If you can't, don't worry about it.  We understand.  It's tinyurl.com slash stevecfun. 
[00:27:00]  The Opie and Anthony show remembers Steve C.  Thank you for joining us.  My name is Iraq, and we're remembering the life and times of Steve Carlissi, Steve C., here on the Opie and Anthony show.  In this segment here, we're going to take a look at Steve's acting and improv skills, both of which the hosts of this show thought were lackluster or non-existent.  In the first segment, Steve's acting ability is portrayed in a production piece that he did with a former intern, Wild Bill, which led to such memorable drops as, get the fuck out, what are you doing in my house, and that's terrible, I'm sorry. 
[00:27:30]  Plus a whole lot more.  And then follow that up with a bit about Steve's improv skills, which Jim just thinks are total shit.  Here it is.  All right, do you want to hear Steve's awful acting, Jimmy?  Yes, I do.  Oh, who doesn't?  Will this wake you up a little bit?  Oh, yeah.  Are they watching him sleep on Palto?  I'm tired.  Yeah.  Yeah, he should be on there.  All right.  This is from Wild Bill Productions, Bill the intern. 
[00:28:00]  We weren't even going to play this, but then we noticed...  Bill's a boob.  Then we noticed that Steve's acting is horrific, and now it's just become part of Opie and Anthony folklore.  The Opie and Anthony Show presents a Wild Bill Production.  Due to the massive critical acclaim and commercial success of the Van and Sam Show, XM202 is proud to present a new Opie and Anthony spin-off,  a program that will surely take the radio world by storm, announcing Steve C. and his best friend, Bill. 
[00:28:30]  Starring Opie and Anthony's own Steve C. and his best friend forever, Bill the intern, who is sensible, articulate, and certainly not crazy.  Hello, anyone home?  Hello?  Hiya, Steve.  Swell, Kondo.  What are you doing in my house?  Why are you pissed off?  What's your fucking problem?  What's my problem?  You're in my fucking house.  All right, listen.  This is so good. 
[00:29:00]  Oh, same song, jizz bag.  It gets better every time you hear it.  What's my problem?  What's my problem?  You're in my fucking house.  By the way, Bill's acting is very believable as the psycho.  Bill's kind of good as the psychopath.  Yeah, definitely.  He's stealing the scene.  He can't quite get the words.  He's spinning.  It's a fucking fucking...  He's like a drunk lunatic, which is what he is.  Let's go back here.  Not really a stretch.  Anyone home?  Hello?  Hiya, Steve.  Swell, Kondo.  What are you doing in my house? 
[00:29:30]  Why are you pissed off?  What's your fucking problem?  What's my problem?  You're in my fucking house.  The door was open.  I thought your wife was going to cook us a nice organic dinner.  Honey, is there a problem?  No.  Nothing's wrong.  Just stay in the living room.  I'll handle it.  Bill, get the fuck out.  Now.  I can't leave.  Why not?  My parents just died, and you're my legal guardian.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  How'd your parents die?  In their sleep?  Bill again.  Bill, Bill is fucking crazy. 
[00:30:00]  Yeah.  The concept for that is just like the ramblings of a mad person.  What is it?  In their sleep?  And then the Gilligan's Island music, and...  What was Steve's other line?  It was, uh...  That's terrible.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  How did they die? 
[00:30:30]  That's terrible.  That's terrible.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  My favorite part is the sing-song.  You're in my fucking house.  That and the...  Stay inside.  I'll handle this.  He's just got...  He's a flat-lining idiot.  Oh.  Because I'm criminal there.  Just stay inside.  Stay inside.  Are you having pillow talk, shithead?  Honey, just stay inside.  We'll go right to the... 
[00:31:00]  We'll go right to the acting here.  Not crazy.  Hello.  Hello.  Anyone home?  Hello?  Hiya, Steve.  It's well, condo.  What are you doing in my house?  Why are you pissed off?  What's your fucking problem?  What's my problem?  You're in my fucking house.  The door was open.  I thought your wife was gonna cook us a nice organic dinner.  Honey, is there a problem?  No, nothing's wrong.  Just stay in the living room.  I'll handle it.  How calm is that?  No, let the fuck out. 
[00:31:30]  No.  I can't leave.  Why not?  My parents just died, and you're my legal guardian.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  How'd your parents die?  In their sleep?  Bill again?  Bill again?  That was so good.  I could listen to that all day.  Steve is awful.  Keep that close. 
[00:32:00]  Everybody goes, I'll handle it.  I'll handle it.  There's a criminal in his house.  I'll handle it.  He stands and I'll handle it.  What's my motivation?  To put everyone to sleep.  Okay.  You're in my fucking house.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  It just stinks.  Steve sucks.  That acting was just DOA. 
[00:32:30]  I just want to yell to...  I'll handle it.  I'll handle it.  And you know, Steve talks with his hands upside down,  pointed upwards,  almost like he's...  Picture someone carrying a yule log  with no log in their hands.  Right.  That's how his hands are always...  And he kind of shuffles them back and forth,  dumbly.  And you know that's how he was actually doing it?  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  Luke, I...  Like he's fondling breasts. 
[00:33:00]  Yeah, like he's got two big balls,  one in each hand.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  You're in my fucking house.  I'll handle it.  They couldn't have gotten through that in one take.  Are there outtakes?  Oh, please tell me.  Come on.  Please tell me there's outtakes.  There's got to be outtakes.  Go through that folder.  All right.  Make sure he doesn't delete them.  All right.  Bastard.  We'll take another break.  We'll get it.  You're in my fucking house. 
[00:33:30]  No, no.  Let's do it again.  You're in my fucking house.  No, no.  Okay, one more.  You're in my fucking house.  No, no.  That was the best version they had.  That was the best takes.  I like this one because there's a little stuttering.  That's terrible.  Sounds so natural.  This is how he reacts to the parents die in the garden.  My parents die.  This is his reaction.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  Wow.  Way to show some feeling. 
[00:34:00]  I love how bad that is.  He should be doing Shakespeare in the rest area.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  Why don't you shut up?  The Opie and Anthony Show remembers Steve C.  Enroll in the Steve Carlisi School of Improv.  Here's one of my students now.  Give me a person, an occupation, and a situation.  Okay, a fireman, a firehouse, and a fire. 
[00:34:30]  Yes, I think there's been a fire in somebody's hell.  This kid's a genius.  He's my best student.  All right, pick an object, a comb.  He's a comb.  My hair must be messy.  Messy.  Oh, my God.  I'm in tears over here.  Someone in the audience, pick an occupation.  Producer.  I have no idea what that is.  How's that for improv?  When in doubt, open your eyes wide and panic.  You wrote in the Steve Carlisi School of Improv. 
[00:35:00]  Yes, I did.  I have no improv skills.  That's good, Derek.  That's Derek.  Oh, damn.  The guy that talks bad about us on our backs?  Yes.  Oh.  Yeah, let him go.  Let him go, you know.  Yeah, let him go.  Who doesn't?  All right.  And now Steve is a ballerina today.  That's wonderful.  I'm a ballerina.  That's right.  I'm a ballerina in training.  Roland, you like Steve?  I do. 
[00:35:30]  I'm also a little teapot short and stout.  That's right.  Here is my handle and here is my gout.  Or there is the closet.  I should step out.  Don't criticize foundry or I'll pout.  My producer skills are in doubt.  That's right.  I came in my pants. 
[00:36:00]  I better use some shouts.  In the world of radio, I have no clout.  That's some pendulum.  What's it about?  My, that pendulum album, stunk worse than trout.  Oh, poor Stevie. 
[00:36:30]  Yeah.  I'm fighting obesity and losing the bout.  Oh, that's not very sweet.  Let me know no one is tickling Roland.  I'm a little teapot.  I'm short and stout.  Here is my handle.  Here is my spout.  Put a finger in my backside and cum shoots out. 
[00:37:00]  Wow.  Steve's good.  He's a good boy. 
[00:37:30]  Of course he is.  What is he talking about?  Who knows?  I hear, I hear like.  Steve, what are you doing?  Chatter.  Yeah.  Probably diesel trucks his cabs have been compared to.  And they thought one time it was a, it was a, I get it, Jim.  Oh.  Wheels came off.  Oh, the wheels on the bus go round and round.  I don't know why I'm singing children's songs now.  Because it was fun.  That little teapot. 
[00:38:00]  A little teapot.  Because you get pictures, Steve, doing that while dressed in like a fucking, a one color  latex outfit.  Like a beige latex outfit.  Except for the black right arm because that's, that's the handle part of the teapot.  Yes.  And I'm short and stout.  And there's my handle.  I want it to be a handle.  That's right.  I want it to be a handle.  Come shoot. 
[00:38:30]  Oh, boy.  The O.P. and Anthony Show remembers Steve C.  Hey, this is John, formerly the WNEW dump guy who used to work with Steve back in the  NEW days with ONA.  And the thing I probably remember the most and was one of the most fun times I ever had  in radio was Steve and I used to write little sort of 60 second bits for the show. 
[00:39:00]  And the fun thing was just, I used to think of these ideas on the bus and I used to not,  just couldn't wait until I got into the station to run into Steve's studio and say, I got this  great, amazing idea.  And he would actually appreciate that I had this idea.  And the two of us would just sit there and just come up with all these crazy things based  on audio from the show.  And we were just cranking them out one after the F after the other, one after the other 
[00:39:30]  after the other.  And it just became the most fun I've had doing radio.  And because of that, Steve and I became really close friends.  We were friends before that, but we became really close friends because of that.  And that's what I was thinking of most when I heard about Steve was, I just wish I could  run into a studio and just write stuff with him again.  So Steve was my friend and I miss him.  I still miss him. 
[00:40:00]  And I think about him every day.  The Opie Anthony Show remembers Steve C.  Yes, remembering our good friend Steve Carlisi in this segment, we've been analyzing his  acting and improv skills.  Well, this upcoming bit here involves actor Brian Cox, who's in studio.  And we bring up the fact that, you know, Steve's an up and coming actor.  He's trying to make it into the big time.  So they asked Brian Cox if he has any advice or direction for Steve as far as achieving an  acting career.  Brian Cox doesn't think so. 
[00:40:30]  Here it is.  Somebody was singing your praises and saying, you know, it was the gentleman with the green  arms who met me at the door.  Oh, this creepy Steve, we call him?  Yeah.  He said that you did a video game together and that you were a wonderful actor.  He said he's a really good actor.  I'm not an actor at all.  Apparently he was in it as well.  That was very nice of you to relay.  But here's what stupid Steve just did.  Let me catch that bastard.  He just wanted you to know that he did something and he couldn't be so obnoxious to go, do  you know, I did a video game.  Would you please tell me what you think?  I did voiceover.  So he had to make it look like he was giving me a compliment. 
[00:41:00]  Well, he was giving you a compliment.  It certainly is with your creepy green arms.  Brian doesn't like it and neither do we.  I didn't say that.  Well, you didn't have to.  Oh, the first thing he said this morning when I gave him the game was, I've got to go to  IMDB and make sure that it's there already.  Yeah.  He wants his credit on IMDB.  Look, if I'm going to get, is this on?  If I'm going to get pummeled, you know, mercilessly, I'm going to make sure it's  up on IMDB.  Yeah, go to Brian's IMDB site and then look at a real actor's site before you look at  your one credit for a voiceover on a video game. 
[00:41:30]  Believe me, I'm not deluding myself at all.  Well, you're like an actor.  I'm not.  Don't sell yourself short.  Do we have, there's a couple of, Steve did a sketch we have audio of.  Do we have a couple just lines, we have like little lines from Steve and if you want  to see somebody emote, I mean, this kid is good.  Well, yeah, give the setup too for Brian.  It was a sketch where Steve, Steve, do you want to explain the sketch to the guy?  No, not really.  It was a, it was a, one of our interns, Bill played a weird guy who walks into Steve's  house and it's a bizarre sketch and Steve just has such emotion and it turns out that 
[00:42:00]  in the sketch, Bill's parents have died.  So Bill, Steve has to ask Bill, how did your parents die?  There's just a lot of emotion in it.  And then there's another part where he says, why not?  Now listen to the emotion, the difference, the dynamic between how did your parents die  and just an ordinary why not grabbed randomly from his lines.  Here's why not.  Why not?  How'd your parents die?  Why not?  How'd your parents die?  Why not? 
[00:42:30]  How'd your parents die?  Is, do you detect the emotion in the parents dying part?  Well, maybe that's, is it good as an actor to just kind of like say everything the same  and figure that the audience can put in the pauses where they feel it's necessary?  Or the emotion?  Yeah.  Or the dynamic?  Or anything?  Steve is like mad libs with emotion.  Like he'll throw out the lines and then let the audience fill in however they feel about it.  Well, it's a very difficult thing to, I can't really tell from just hearing those two lines. 
[00:43:00]  Oh, yes, you can.  Because that's it.  That's his range.  Well, it seems to me it sounded real.  That's, that's, that's, you know, sometimes that's the best you can say.  The views are in.  I mean, the thing about.  Brian Cox, it sounded real.  He'll put it on his bio.  He'll put it on his bio as a credit.  He quotes around.  You can't hear it again.  Yeah, here he goes.  Why not?  How'd your parents die?  Why not?  How'd your parents die?  Well, there was a genuine intention there. 
[00:43:30]  You could hear the intention was that he really wanted to know how their parents died.  So, in fact, he succeeded quite well.  I don't think that's bad at all.  And also, he didn't let emotion get in the way.  Right.  But what I want to know is, what does the why not relate to?  I don't get the why not and the why doesn't really relate to how.  What was the why not again?  I don't remember.  Was it that Bill wanted to come in?  And he said, can I come in?  And you said, why not?  Oh, no.  It was, I can't go home.  And he couldn't go back.  Oh, he can't go home. 
[00:44:00]  And then he said, why not?  And he goes, my parents died.  And then, Steve, we have a response.  Steve goes, how'd your parents die?  But when Bill says, my parents died, Steve has a response to that.  Yes.  Which is just thick with compassion and emotion.  Yes.  It's beautiful.  Some more, Steve.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  He has a little stutter, a stammer thing.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  Yeah.  You're embarrassed.  Which is fine.  I can see that.  And that's a kind of genuine emotion. 
[00:44:30]  Some of these, some of these, this gentleman's parents have died.  And you're embarrassed that they've died.  And you're saying, can you hear it again?  Yes, of course, sir.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  So you're saying, that's terrible.  I'm sorry.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  That's a complete lack of hope.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  And it's like, I want to get out of the room because it's terrible.  And I'm sorry.  So I actually think you do it quite well.  I'm actually rather impressed. 
[00:45:00]  Thank you, sir.  Brian just took horse manure and made lemonade.  But, you know, half the thing with all of this, I mean, I've just done this movie called  Running With Scissors.  Yeah.  And the thing is, the material is so extraordinary.  You don't have to do anything.  You just sit back on it and let it ride you rather than try and ride it.  Because there's no way you could ever match it.  I'm looking forward to the movie.  I've read the book.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's a good movie.  It's a crazy story.  Are you playing the psychiatrist?  I play Finch. 
[00:45:30]  Yeah.  I play the doctor.  The doctor.  Yeah.  And the psychiatrist.  He adopts.  I adopt Augustine Burroughs.  Right, right.  And it's a really good story.  I mean, people have been going on about the veracity of it.  The truth.  Sorry.  I don't want to use big words.  That's okay.  Steve's still in the room.  Sorry, Steve.  I'm sorry.  I don't understand that.  That's okay.  I'm sorry.  Terrible.  The Opiate Anthony Show remembers friend and producer Steve Carlisi.  Continuing on with analyzing Steve's acting and improv skills, you just heard from Brian 
[00:46:00]  Cox.  And in this upcoming bit here, we have Tobin Bell and Shawnee Smith.  They're in promoting, I think, one of the Saw movies.  And of course, it's brought up again that Steve's trying to be an actor.  And maybe these guys who are professionals at their craft have worked hard for many, many  years and make very good money doing so.  Does Steve have the chops to join their ranks?  Who knows, as Tobin Bell and Shawnee Smith judge the acting abilities of Steve C.  We have an actor among us.  You do? 
[00:46:30]  We have a few, actually.  Raise your hands if you're an actor.  Jeez, we've got to raise our hands.  Nobody raised their hands.  I've done it, but it's, I don't, you know, you can't be with two real actors.  Me too.  I'm an actor too.  I was a store clerk in an Opiate Anthony TV commercial.  That's just like your career, sir.  Yeah, I played a few store clerks, you know.  And do we have some examples of Steve's acting?  This is Steve.  Steve, here's our actor right here.  Yeah.  Steve? 
[00:47:00]  Oh, Steve.  Yeah, here's Steve's acting.  Yeah, exactly.  Steve's looking happy to be in here right now.  Steve, I don't recognize you.  Oh, come on, Steve, you're good.  Where's the rest of the Steve?  Uh, what?  Where's the rest of the Steve?  We got this one.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  Oh, there it is.  Here's Steve.  Here's Steve delivering his lines.  Um, now listen, one line he had to deliver was...  Steve, you look nervous.  No, not nervous.  Just it's when the bus tire actually rolls onto your chest, you just have to sort of go limp. 
[00:47:30]  He had to ask how someone's parents died.  And in another scene, it was just him saying, why not?  So we took those two and, and, and you know how much emotion would have to go into asking  someone how their parents died.  And then just why not as a throwaway line, listen to the difference, the dynamic.  Before you play that though, I was wondering maybe if Tobin could like do the line and then  we'll show, uh, Tobin how Steve did it.  Is that okay with you?  Absolutely.  Okay.  I'd like to.  I'd like to.  All right.  Give him his motivation and the line he has to send.  And then I'll review you both. 
[00:48:00]  Just to throw away, like, uh, you don't really care.  Um, somebody may ask you to go somewhere.  You don't really care.  You just go, why not?  You know, why not?  That's it.  Why not?  There you go.  Why not?  Why not?  Yeah.  See, you got a couple of different variations from him too, Steve.  Right.  This is what Steve does.  And now this one, the line is, had your parents die.  Now, you would think that's a very, how'd your parents die. 
[00:48:30]  You'd think it's a very emotional thing.  You'd want a little sympathy, a little curiosity to it and stuff.  And, uh, Steve delivered it perfectly, but let's see how a real actor would, would deliver  that.  How'd your parents die?  Do I have to have the contraction in there?  The how'd?  Or can I say how'd?  Whatever you want to do it.  You can, you know, I just want to make sure.  You're the professional.  You're the professional.  I don't know about these kind of things.  Yeah, right? 
[00:49:00]  And action.  How did your parents die?  Wow.  Wow.  See?  Wow.  That was good.  I think you screwed, Steve.  Wow.  That was good, eh?  All right.  Now, here is the dynamic.  That was a good question about the contraction, though, because anybody wanted to do it.  They knew.  Yeah.  Perfect.  Perfect.  Here is Steve delivering those two lines.  Why not?  How'd your parents die?  Listen to the dynamic difference involved in them.  Why not?  How'd your parents die?  Why not?  Wait, hold on.  How'd your parents die? 
[00:49:30]  Wait, wait.  The bus is backing up.  Yeah.  Evidently.  Why not?  How'd your parents die?  It wasn't quite as poignant as Tobin.  How'd your parents die?  Why not?  How'd your parents die?  Oh.  He's got a lot of range.  He's got a lot of range.  Yeah.  Slightly different.  A lot of range, Tobin.  Slightly different.  Versatility of a rake.  You stink.  Yes, I do.  So, I mean, you started so young.  How did you get into acting?  What'd you do? 
[00:50:00]  Commercials?  Yeah, commercials.  Yeah.  There was a girl on the street who did the Northern Toilet Paper.  Northern Toilet Paper?  You did a toilet paper commercial?  No, the girl up the street did.  Bitch.  And unfortunately, we went for walks around the block.  My mom talked to her mom, got my mom's panties all in a bunch about, you know, my daughter  could do that.  So, the next thing I know, she's got me out with the camera, taking pictures, and send  it to the agency, and then I'm on a McDonald's commercial.  Yeah, you make it sound so easy.  Yeah.  And then you were like, just, you know, kind of watched you grow up every so often. 
[00:50:30]  It's like, hey, there she is.  Yeah.  I remember her from that last movie.  She was a little younger in the last movie.  Have you been stalking her?  Yeah, totally.  Yeah, a little creepy.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  It's one of my faves.  Yeah.  Pops up in movies all the time.  Overnight success with the Saw movies.  Yeah.  Very cool.  After two decades.  Oh, please.  Love it.  I'm sure people are constantly, like, you get recognized a lot, don't you?  Not a lot.  Really?  Not a lot.  People recognize me more when they hear me speak than looking at me. 
[00:51:00]  Yeah.  Because, you know, I don't always have this.  Different color hair.  Yeah.  Just all rocked out today.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I glammed up for you guys.  You glammed.  Fantastic.  Thank you.  I heard you were edgy.  Yeah.  I think we have to get them out of here.  Edgy.  They're telling us you had a...  Yeah.  We just saw you on TV.  I don't want to talk about it.  Where are you going next, you guys?  I have no idea.  Neither do I.  They just cart you around.  It's too overwhelming to look at the big picture.  How did your parents die?  Oh, is that good, man? 
[00:51:30]  It really is.  Wow.  I can't believe it when he says that.  That's the way it's delivered, you dork.  I'll tell you how Steve's parents died.  They shot themselves after they heard his performance.  Yes, they did.  Steve.  Yeah.  Keep it up.  Keep it up.  Thank you.  Don't let the critics bring you down.  Oh, I never will.  Why, Steve?  Because they don't know.  That's right.  Okay.  That's right.  The O.P.  Anthony show remembers friend and producer Steve Carlisi.  Hello, everyone. 
[00:52:00]  This is Earl.  Long-time O&A fans know me as Black Earl.  And I'm, this is hard.  I'm not going to mince words about it.  I worked with Steve at NEW when I was there.  I was there for many years, and he came aboard first as kind of the web guy.  He ran all the video.  He posted all the video on foundrymusic.com of some of the better O&A bits that happened, 
[00:52:30]  some of the most incredible things you had ever experienced on the radio.  And then we worked together.  And when I was there, I was a promotions guy and also as a producer.  And then he came aboard as the production guy.  He handled all of the O&A production, basically all the station production after a while.  And got to know him pretty well.  Um, we had a lot of talks. 
[00:53:00]  I mean, one of the things that was great about Steve was that he was very, he was funny.  He was really funny.  He had this, like, really twisted sense of humor that I loved.  And, but he was also very honest.  He was honest at the point of brutal, but you respected it because you want honesty from people.  You want to know where people stand.  And Steve, there was no middle ground.  You knew where you stood with Steve.  And, uh, we had so many laughs in his studio. 
[00:53:30]  He would play me something or we would talk about things.  Uh, you know, in recent years, we would talk about other things, you know, talk about the  business, talk about this, talk about that.  And it was always warm.  It was always fun.  It was always remarkable.  The last conversation I had with him was about family.  You know, his, he was so happy to be a father.  And, uh, and when I got the news, that's, that's the first thing that really hit me hard 
[00:54:00]  was that his, that his son, you know, wasn't going to, you know, wasn't going to have his  dad.  You know, and my heart goes out to his wife and, uh, his stepdaughter and of course his  son.  And, um, I'm going to miss this, those crazy days, just kind of hanging, talking, laughing,  a lot of laughs with Steve.  Um, he's just this big bear of a guy.  I mean, he had his nickname was Steve the bear, but, and it fit and if he was a bear, but I  mean, underneath that gruff exterior was a really warm, sweet guy. 
[00:54:30]  And I'm going to miss him.  I mean, I took the, I'm still processing and I'm still kind of like trying to figure out  what happened and, and I still can't believe he's gone.  And, um, Steve, I'm going to miss you.  I love you, brother.  Love.  The Opie and Anthony show remembers friend and producer Steve Carlesi.  And it is true.  Um, Steve C who worked for this show for, I don't know, at least 10 years died and, uh,  I'm sick about it.  Steve left behind a two year old, a wife and a stepdaughter who's 16 or 17. 
[00:55:00]  I believe to donate to Steve's family's tinyurl.com slash Steve C fun.  If you can give great, if you can't, don't worry about it.  We understand it's tinyurl.com slash Steve C fun.  The Opie and Anthony show remembers Steve C.  Hey, this is Roland.  Uh, I booked the town for the Opie and Anthony show and, uh, it's terrible what happened to  Steve of his passing. 
[00:55:30]  It's very sad.  Uh, I first met Steve when I first started booking for the show when they went to XM radio.  I remember the first day when I met him, yeah, I met him and Master Poe were my first two  interactions ever with the show.  And Steve sort of took me under his wing to introduce me to everybody.  And, uh, and, uh, and we built our friendship from there.  Uh, my most, my, my, my, my, my, my probably in the main, it was like the last, uh, oh, I 
[00:56:00]  can't talk.  Um, the last week when XM and Sirius merged, I was leaving the guys for a little bit and,  uh, Steve was, was sad and we would always talk back and forth, did lunch the whole, my  whole last week on the show when they were at K rock and XM and Steve wanted, uh, he tried  his hardest to get Springsteen on the phone and, uh, Carson Daly, my other old boss on 
[00:56:30]  the phone to, uh, to say my, to say the goodbyes and everything.  And on the last day, Steve came up to me, he goes, I tried, I couldn't get Bruce.  I couldn't get Carson.  I tried, called everybody.  I did this.  I did that.  And I started laughing.  I had to tell him, go, yeah, I know I was texted that you were trying to get ahold of  him.  I said, dad, just don't bother calling in.  And Steve was like, Oh, and all this time I spent.  And he was, he always, and he just laughed at it and just, uh, we always kept on contact. 
[00:57:00]  And then it just, I don't know, Steve was just a good guy.  He always protected you.  He's like the big brother that oversaw things and helped you and protected you.  And, uh, it's just, I'm going to miss him.  It's, it's very sad.  And I deepest sympathies to his wife and his kid.  It just, uh, I don't know.  It's one of those things where you're just like, you almost don't believe it.  And then once it sits in, it's just depressing. 
[00:57:30]  But I can say Steve was just a great guy, a great friend and an amazing person.  The Opie and Anthony show remembers friend and producer Steve Carlisi.  Yes, we're looking back at the memory of our fallen friend, Steve Carlisi here, uh, all his time spent on the Opie and Anthony show.  Some of the, the most, uh, memorable and, uh, idiotic things that Steve has done on this program and said on this program. 
[00:58:00]  Um, this one, this one's a doozy.  It's a, I said doozy.  But this one is, this one was a big one, uh, involving Corey Delaney.  Now, who is Corey Delaney?  Corey Delaney was this kid from Australia who decided to throw a big house party and publish it on MySpace at the time where over 500 people showed up at this house and destroyed everything.  To the extent that the cops had to come and wait for the party to burn out before they could clean up and arrest everybody and what have you.  So we play a news piece, uh, from Australia where they're interviewing Corey and he's a real, uh, sarcastic asshole, if you will. 
[00:58:30]  We enjoyed it.  So we tried to get the guy on the phone.  Steve did a little research and lo and behold, we got the guy on the phone.  Now, where this piece that you're going to hear picks up, we already played the audio and we've already talked to Corey on the phone.  This is the very next day where we find out, did we talk to the real Corey Delaney?  Did Steve do a good job?  I'll let you hear it for yourself.  If you haven't heard it before, this is a classic moment in Steve C. history. 
[00:59:00]  And it's also the debut of a catchphrase that I won't give to you because people say I spoil things.  But this is the big catchphrase for Steve Carlesi other than, yes, and I'm gay.  Um, check it out right now.  Scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll to the wrong person.  Hello, is this Australian?  Is Corey there?  Is this Australia?  Who would you like me? 
[00:59:30]  Hey, Corey, the man on the computer.  Corey, could you please connect me with him?  Oh, hello, this is Corey.  It's him.  He's got an accent.  Hi, do you have an XM?  Huh?  Okay, good.  Could you talk to Opie Anthony?  Obviously, it's time for a beating.  Yes.  It's Corey.  I hear a diggeridoo.  A diggeridoo.  All right.  Hey, uh.  So it says here you're a kangaroo lasso-er. 
[01:00:00]  Hello, Australia.  That's great.  Yes.  I'm trying to call a continent.  Yes.  His name is Corey.  Do you have a last name?  No, but he's the guy from the news clip.  The news.  You've had to have seen it in Australia.  He has delicious, delicious nipple rings and a smooth chest.  Like me.  I don't know why I'm here. 
[01:00:30]  You guys are doing so well.  I know.  It's just more fun when you're in the room.  I don't know why.  So this is where we get dragged into the story.  We got the kid on the phone yesterday that threw the party.  We just played his audio, obviously.  And now it looks like it wasn't the kid.  Right.  According to...  Or at least according to everybody, yeah.  Oh, it's everybody now?  Well, no.  This does seem like it was a scam.  Definitely.  Yeah, it seems like here's exactly what happened.  The website that you guys plugged yesterday, like within 24 hours of the kid being on the 
[01:01:00]  show is now redirecting to some other website that says, ha ha, gotcha.  Oh, shit.  Yeah, basically.  It was...  Can you get the guy on and give him his props?  Well, wait a minute.  I'll call him.  Uh-oh, I inadvertently got the real guy.  Yeah.  Travis had the guys correct MySpace.  What's that about?  What's up, Travis?  What do you got on this?  Good evening.  When Steve asks me to do something, I usually try and do it. 
[01:01:30]  And then Steve will try and do it at the same time.  And, uh...  Okay.  And he won't, uh...  You know, he won't match notes with me before he bursts into my booth with a phone number.  Ooh.  I found the guy's fake MySpace, and Sam and I immediately knew that it was fake.  Because you've made so many fake MySpaces for people.  That's not true.  Because, uh...  It's because he had, uh... 
[01:02:00]  All of his pictures were just, you know, screen caps of this kid that was on the news.  Ah.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Any idiot would know that.  Yeah.  And then I find his real MySpace two seconds later with, you know, personal pictures of  him and his email address.  So I sent the guy an email.  And, uh, ten minutes later, Steve bursts into my booth saying, I found his MySpace and I've  got his phone number, and that's, uh...  And you were a wealth of information when there were six people trying to dial this guy on  the phone yesterday?  Steve, it doesn't matter. 
[01:02:30]  I found the guy's real MySpace.  You've got the fake one.  Well, no.  The point...  I understand.  I...  Look, I'm not saying I didn't get...  I...  I...  I didn't get duped.  I did a little research before I settled on something.  I did the same thing you did.  I did the same thing you did, which is go online, you check Google, you Google the kid's  name, unfortunately, the one I, the one I, I wound up contacting was ranked higher than  the one you wound up contacting.  And that's why...  And that was the first kid I got a response from.  Anyway.  Well, I look for...  Point is, listen...  Wait, did you get the guy's email you back?  No, he never got email.  I think that's because he's in police custody. 
[01:03:00]  Okay.  Yeah.  He was, uh, actually in custody when we were talking, I think, to the people yesterday.  It's...  12.30 in the, in the a.m.  No, he was arrested after that, I think.  Was he?  We got duped.  So, um, the world gets, uh, brainwaved.  Is that a new term?  Or just for the stupid website?  I think that's supposed to be a lot.  Yeah.  Slug line.  Uh, it's safe to say John's surname and myself are probably the greatest humans alive.  That's a little pompous.  Yeah, a little...  It's a little arrogant.  So, this is the guy that duped us? 
[01:03:30]  Yeah.  Well, that guy really, uh, thinks he's the greatest person alive.  Not a lot of humility there.  He said, it's safe to say John's surname and myself are probably the greatest humans alive.  Humans?  Are you crazy?  How about Jonas Salk?  Yeah, yeah.  You pulled a good prank.  Throwing something out there.  Sorry.  No one gets the polio reference.  I got it.  Thank you.  That was hard to read there.  Who the fuck knows what time it is in that shit country?  Right.  Anyone that has an iPhone. 
[01:04:00]  Yeah?  Yeah, you just pop it right in there.  Boom.  Tells you what time it is.  The whole world cares.  A big party with a bunch of fucking white kids running probably through a dirt street.  No one cares.  Dirt street.  Berries in it.  And then...  Berries in it.  And then...  A dead dingo on the side of the road.  A wallaby.  Fucking elk taking shits in the driveway.  We get dragged in right here.  Opie and Anthony get brainwaved.  Oh, boy.  Did we?  But then came the big time. 
[01:04:30]  So, they were tricking everybody, but we were the big ones.  We're the big time.  We were the big fish.  Rocks.  We received an email from them at this point, in time, saying that they would like to do  a live interview with Corey Delaney on their show, if he was willing.  Only Corey wasn't there, just us and our stupid fake MySpace.  At 1223 a.m.  After a few connection issues, John's surname appeared as the infamous Corey Delaney on  the Opie and Anthony show.  But I felt that we did a good interview, even though it wasn't him.  Hey, maybe you can get Tim Manson on the phone. 
[01:05:00]  We're going to do a prison interview with him.  Well, how about everyone listen for themselves?  So, let's listen.  Oh, wait a minute.  We're getting an exclusive here on line two.  Oh, good.  That's good.  Steve?  Yeah.  You want to take this call?  Absolutely.  Hello?  Hello?  Yes, hello.  Who's this?  Is this the Opie and Anthony show?  It absolutely is.  Who's this?  This is Amelia Earhart.  Earhart.  Wow.  Amelia Earhart missing for so long.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:05:30]  That's fantastic.  Cool.  Go ahead and fuck up your own name, Amelia.  Well, it's been lost for a while.  Thank you for taking my call.  I appreciate it.  And please check out my web space.  Punching out.  Well, you should have punched out, perhaps.  I did well.  So, let's listen to this.  This is us talking to the fake Corey yesterday.  Now it's interesting to listen to.  Listen to the signs that maybe this guy wasn't real.  Hold on a minute.  I've got to take a phone call here.  Who's calling?  Hello?  Hello?  Hey.  Hi.  Who's this?  This is Elvis Presley, baby. 
[01:06:00]  Oh, Steve.  It sounds like him.  What do you think?  I think it's him.  All right, Elvis.  I need you to get her own Priscilla for me, all right?  Get her website for me, all right?  All right.  I'm telling her I'm alive.  All right.  We'll go to your web.  Punching out.  Punching out.  Can I ask why we had a faker yesterday, but now why everyone's dead calling?  How does it translate into contacting the dead?  Yeah.  Because it's tough to stay in hiding these days. 
[01:06:30]  There's no other way to do this pitch, I mean, if you think about it.  And how did Elvis know to say punching out?  Yeah.  He's been listening.  Hi.  Who's this?  This is D.B. Cooper.  D.B. Cooper.  Wow.  D.B. Cooper.  Now this one might be a little.  Steve, I want to tell you where I am and where all my fortunes are.  Go ahead.  All right.  Steve, can you take this phone call, please?  Absolutely.  Hello?  This is Osama bin Laden.  Oh.  Jesus.  Somebody get the FBI.  You're infidels. 
[01:07:00]  You have not found me yet.  Well, I will.  I'm hiding.  You think this will make the news?  I mean, we're talking with Osama bin Laden.  It absolutely will.  I'll cut it up and send it off to all the papers.  Send it off.  You think FARC will post our interview?  I don't think FARC's posted anything for a while.  Oh, you just fucked up all your connections.  I listen to the O.C. and Anthony show all the time.  All right.  Thank you, Osama.  It's good, Osama, who sounds like a fucking Hindu.  Indian customer fucking service.  You look like assholes right now, man.  Yeah, we do. 
[01:07:30]  More of the fake Corey interview.  We're going to check in with you.  But the next time we try calling, you're not going to take our call.  That happens all the time with us, with you Internet stars.  Oh, no.  Remember?  Just turn it off, Iraq.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  You Internet stars.  Some kid in his fucking parents' basement.  We're part of a jerky boy tape. 
[01:08:00]  Oh, my fucking God.  I hope me and Anthony can paint each other up.  Paint each other up.  Shit.  Can you go back?  I got to hear how uncomfortable this is for everybody.  Oh, my God.  So, it's official we got duped, right?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, that wasn't him.  Well, Steve, you shouldn't be happy about it.  No, I'm not happy at all.  I feel...  We got duped.  Steve.  Mm-hmm.  I'm not happy about it at all. 
[01:08:30]  I don't like feeling like a jackass anymore.  It really does.  Fantastic.  We got one more piece of the story, and, of course, this will be good because Sam's in  the studio.  Sam has no problem.  I'm just...  Well, I mean, I was duped just like everybody else, and, you know, we can't cast blame on  anyone here, but when we... Steve was really happy about his...  Oh, I was gloating.  Are you fucking kidding?  Oh, no.  I was...  I was proud.  I walked back into the office, and Steve was standing with his arms up in the air and 
[01:09:00]  his chest out and his elbow sticking out, saying...  And he literally said this.  I'm sure it was bad.  And that's how you executive produce.  Oh, no, you did not.  Wow.  Did I really say that?  I can't even look at it.  Oh, I can't.  I won't.  You can actually repeat that to him now and go, and that's how you executive produce.  Wow.  Wow.  And a man in my position can't afford to be mad to look ridiculous. 
[01:09:30]  Wow, what a schmuck.  Wow.  And that's how you executive produce.  My friends, let me school you.  He's teaching the boys a life lesson.  That's right.  Oh, look at Steve.  This old dog just taught some new tricks.  Yes.  He can always dance with his arms and everything, and that's how you executive produce.  Oh, no.  Oh, that would have been a dog shit thing to say if you'd actually done the correct booking. 
[01:10:00]  Yeah, right?  If everything went swimmingly, that's a shitty thing to say.  And that's how you...  Oh, I cannot look at Steve.  I'm a mess.  What makes today look different than the other day?  Oh, no.  That's how you executive produce.  Oh, that...  Because that's fucking Beretta, and that's the name of that tune.  Yeah.  All right, rummy.  That's right.  Hold on.  I've got to shoot a money-grubbing cunt right in the belly. 
[01:10:30]  Yeah, Steve, can you say it once?  What?  What Sam said you said.  The way you said it.  Yeah.  Stand up and do it.  Please?  And that's how you executive produce.  That was good?  That was a little better.  You know, without even nailing it, we all know exactly what it sounded like.  Like, I could picture exactly what it sounded like.  I was a gloating, egocentric douche. 
[01:11:00]  You're in my fucking country.  Oh, I was so impressed with my ability to get somebody on the phone.  How did your parents find out about the party?  You wanted to make a point to these guys.  Yep.  Basically, he's like, and see, you guys have been wondering for a really long time, this  is why I'm here.  This is the reason right here.  I want to thank Steve for another valuable lesson learned.  You're welcome.  The next time I need a splash in the face of sarcasm, I'll come see you. 
[01:11:30]  Yes.  All right, get out of here, Steve.  Thank you.  You can work on a dumb character, will you?  That's what I was doing.  You're the dumb.  Ramon, fact check.  Hey, it's Ron and Fez here, and we wanted to say just a couple words about our good buddy,  Steve C.  Steve C. was just the sweetest guy there was.  And I remember there was a kindred spirit there in loving the Star Wars, loving the comic book movies, loving the toys. 
[01:12:00]  Steve loved his toys.  Steve C. and I also agreed on one thing.  Neither one of us trusted Sam Roberts.  And there was a long period of time where we were the only two people who realized that Sam had been bilking SiriusXM out of a lot of money.  And we said to ourselves, we're going to get Sam, and we're going to make sure that the bosses know exactly what he's been up into.  And then one day, we found a bloody knife in Sam's desk, which had been traced back to me because I was so frustrated. 
[01:12:30]  I thought, let's just end this now.  I'll plant some evidence on him.  And, of course, I'll always remember, Steve, every time I hear the words,  Spy report.  Spy report.  The man could do more with two words than most people could with full sentences.  We'll miss you very much, Steve C.  The Opie and Anthony Show remembers friend and producer Steve Carlisi. 
[01:13:00]  Thank you for joining us.  My name is E-Rock.  Looking back at our friend Steve Carlisi here, all his time spent on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Steve had a lot of memorable segments on the Opie and Anthony Show.  This is another fan favorite.  When we found out that Steve owned a Prius.  Now, he bought the Prius so he could save on gas.  Priuses are not really the most manliest of cars.  Prius and Steve being a big dude in a small electric car.  And right after that, we find out that Steve, who was pounding his chest about how great he was doing 
[01:13:30]  and saving the environment and all this money with his hybrid.  Well, guess what?  The fucking thing broke down.  Steve drives a hybrid, which is just creepy on some level.  My hybrid.  It runs on water and honey and bee energy.  I scoop them out and I put them in the gas tank.  And as they try to leave, my car goes.  Generates energy.  Stupid.  Fucking try to keep his own little outdoor place.  Bee power.  There you go.  Yeah, that's all well and fine. 
[01:14:00]  You know, the hybrids.  But he still pulls up to a gas pump.  Yeah.  He still uses petrol.  I just think they're like, you're a mulatto, mongrel class of vehicle.  Steve's got the hybrid.  What's wrong with the hybrid?  Nothing.  I was actually defending it.  How much does it cost to fill up?  Now it's about $20.50.  $20.50 to fill up your tank.  Right there.  It makes it sound great.  How many miles did it go?  400 miles on that.  400 miles.  I'm noticing I'm getting a little lonely out there in the huge SUV club. 
[01:14:30]  Oh, yeah.  You certainly are.  You look around and remember a couple of years back, you could not, you drive down any highway,  it was SUV after SUV.  Now, not seeing as many.  Your hybrid, which actually gave us a nice ride to Ozfest.  Yeah.  It really did.  How was the acceleration, Jim?  The pickup is not that bad.  It's a quick little car.  It doesn't go really fast.  It goes maybe, I've had it up to about 95 miles an hour.  Yeah.  And at that speed, it gets about 12 miles to the gallon. 
[01:15:00]  Maybe around 11 and a half miles to the gallon.  But at most...  Wait, wait, wait.  What?  12 miles a gallon?  That's a hunk of shit.  I thought it was like 80 miles a gallon.  No, no, no, no.  At that speed.  Well, he was going 95 miles an hour.  At 95 miles an hour.  Oh, right.  If you're going extremely fast.  How would my Saturn, and I'm not trying to name drop, but how much would my Saturn get  to a gallon?  90 miles an hour?  A rough guess.  Probably not that good either.  Okay, okay.  When I'm coasting around the city, this thing gets around 60 miles to the gallon.  I mean, when you look at the energy meter, it says it's getting 100 miles to the gallon. 
[01:15:30]  You have an energy meter?  The whole front of the thing.  You've got to get in this car.  My energy meter.  Yeah, half those meters are bullshit.  They're just there spinning and lighting up for no real reason.  Well, it tells you when the engine is shut off, basically.  When the gasoline engine has shut down, and you're running on battery power.  When you're running on battery power.  Oh, shit.  Where are your batteries stored in the triplet?  In the trunk.  Well, not in the trunk.  It's in that area, I guess.  Below the trunk.  Yeah, below the trunk.  Where a gas tank would be.  Yeah, I mean, half of it is like maybe a 10 or 11-gallon gas tank. 
[01:16:00]  Any problems?  Say you run out of gas.  How far can you go on your battery?  I've had it down to zero once, and I went about maybe 20 miles, I think.  And you're on no gas?  On no gas.  I mean, but you have to drive pretty slow.  You've got to drive about 30 miles an hour when you do that.  Why did you run out of gas?  Because I wasn't paying attention.  What could you...  With all those gauges and meters, I got confused.  It was brand new.  It was brand new, and I thought, ah, shit, let's see what this thing can do.  And I was on.  I know what happened.  What happened?  You went to get gas, and when you got out, they thought you were threatening. 
[01:16:30]  They didn't realize you were just standing up to look around.  I seem to have run out of petrol.  Tigger, could you pump some gas into this piece?  Or something that sounds like that to the attendant.  Wow.  I'm spending a lot less on gas.  Yeah, I got my hybrid.  It's a chick magnet.  Lexus is making a hybrid Lexus SUV that's coming out. 
[01:17:00]  Actually, I think it's out right now.  Really?  The Highlander is an SUV.  Hummer's making a hybrid, which I don't understand.  No.  It's going to be maybe 14 miles to a gallon.  What make is yours?  Toyota.  Tell B-Power Steve that all the money he's saving on gas will be spent replacing that $500 battery in about three years.  Also, that big old acid-filled battery causes more damage to the environment than gas.  No, it doesn't.  No, it doesn't.  You don't have, it's not vented, right?  Not vented batteries.  No.  The old-style batteries used to leak. 
[01:17:30]  Yeah, it's totally self-contained, and there's tons of them.  Have they told you about battery life and how long those things are supposed to last?  Sure.  Something tells me it ain't just like going to Sears and buying one of those batteries and popping it under your hood.  Well, no, that's the thing.  It does regenerate power.  It doesn't, you know, the combustion engine powers the fuel cell while you're driving.  So as far as how long that lasts, I don't know.  I can look it up, though.  Yeah.  Chuck from Pittsburgh saying, sorry, the increase in my weekly gas costs from $1.60 a gallon to $2.60 a gallon is about $22.  The cost of walking away from an accident, priceless. 
[01:18:00]  There you go.  I like some steel around me, my friend.  How about that?  What happens when your car gets rear-ended and you get battery acid all over?  Well, that is the one drawback.  Yeah, that is a drawback.  The whole fucking car is a crumple zone.  It's a huge, like, of just tinfoil and battery acid is what you drive around in.  Yeah, it's a very light car, hopefully.  And if you read about hybrids, you realize that the progression would be to build these things out of lighter, stronger metals. 
[01:18:30]  Of course.  So that, you know, you could build a smaller car that wouldn't waste so much.  Composites.  Exactly.  Space-age polymers.  Exactly.  But that's where it's going.  Steve.  Oh, there goes Steve.  Steve is driving around in the studio in his hybrid.  Here comes Steve to work.  Steve.  Hey, Steve.  Steve's going to laugh in his hybrid.  Cool.  Look out.  Here he comes.  Oh, Steve.  He's showing off now.  Jesus.  There's a bear driving the hybrid. 
[01:19:00]  Clumsy claws are trying to hit the buttons.  They're fumbling.  Steve.  Careful.  It doesn't make sense that you're the one with the hybrid.  You should be driving the Hummer.  Oh, you need the big vehicle.  I used to have an SUV.  You must be hysterical squeezing into that thing.  No, it's surprisingly roomy on the inside.  Oak's been inside it.  There's actually a lot of room on the inside.  It's really strange.  You can't put anything on your dashboard because it starts off really, really, you know, tiny.  It gets bigger. 
[01:19:30]  All right.  Hop in it again, Steve.  Take another laugh around.  Hey, man.  Hey, man.  Hey, man.  Hang it.  It's a hybrid.  Steve on the side of the highway, broken down with an electrical cord, looking for a place to plug it in.  The O.P. and Anthony Show remembers Steve C.  Here comes Steve.  Where is he?  Uh-oh.  Yeah.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh. 
[01:20:00]  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Steve, what's the problem?  Well, you know, hybrids are very efficient, but the one way they do perform just like regular  cars is when you leave the dome light on all night, it does kill the regular battery.  The dome light on for what?  Three seconds?  Wait.  That's all it took?  What, leaving the-  To shut down your hybrid?  Leaving the interior lights on all night, yeah.  Killed the-  Killed-  It didn't shut off the hybrid engine, so once I got it jumped, it worked just fine. 
[01:20:30]  But the regular electronics, like all the windows and stuff like that, operate off the  same battery that a regular car would operate off of.  And your starter?  Yeah, everything.  So leaving all the lights on would kill the battery just like it would in any other car.  But why would it kill-  Did it kill the electric motor that drives your car?  Not at all.  So theoretically, you could have backed out under electric power?  Once I got it jumped, the thing worked fine.  I'm not talking about to get it jumped.  That's right.  I mean, could you have backed it out under your electric motor power? 
[01:21:00]  Well, no, because I couldn't start it.  But isn't it just a switch because it's-  The electric switch that powers, the switch that turns on the car again.  The actual switch that turns on that 300-volt electric motor is powered by a normal, regular  diehard battery.  Oh, so even though there's enough power to run the electric motor, you can't start it  to run it on the electric motor.  That I learned last night, or yesterday morning. 
[01:21:30]  Yeah, exactly.  Because you should be able to run it on just the electric motor.  That's exactly what I thought.  And once you actually get the thing, once you actually power up the starter and get  it going, yeah, everything's fine.  You know, and it starts pumping the power back into the regular auxiliary battery.  Shouldn't there be a backup that perhaps the batteries that power your electric motor  that were fine, you say, can then be used to maybe jumpstart your car?  I think there actually is, but I wasn't- I'm not, you know, well-versed enough in-  Is there?  Try it again. 
[01:22:00]  Ah, the old faggot-mobile is not starting up.  It's not a faggot-mobile.  I am paying a lot less for gasoline.  You've got to jump on a cock and ride that to work.  Did you jerk off in the gas tank?  Come on, Steve, come on, yeah!  Ah, all right, well.  Piece of crap.  I'm going to go work on my new song, Chemistry Got Killed With A Claw Hammer.  So how did you get into work?  They gave me a rental until they can- 
[01:22:30]  Ooh!  Yeah, I mean, it's not- I have- it's under full warranty, and they go, yeah, okay, we're  just going to replace the battery.  So they gave you a rental?  Was it a hybrid rental?  No, it's not, because they can't keep those in the showroom long enough to-  Oh, they're flying off the shelf.  They certainly are.  Not a lot.  You know what?  Call me a homo if you want, but, you know, the fact that it is-  All right.  Homo.  Fag.  But there's a year-long waiting list for these cars, so, you know-  You know what else is a waiting list for?  AZT.  Well, when they only make a- 
[01:23:00]  Well, when they only make a hundred a year.  That's not-  They don't-  Exactly.  That's why there's a waiting list, you idiot.  How many are on the assembly line?  Plenty of them.  Oh, stop it.  Did you-  Wait, when we were in Los Angeles, didn't you see all the hybrid cars that were out there?  No.  No, I did.  I was too busy whizzing past them in some souped-up rocket car that I rented.  What happened to your car?  Did the power surge protector fail?  Plug-in vehicle makes me sick.  Steve was driving to work and almost got rear-ended because he pushed in the cigarette lighter by accident, 
[01:23:30]  and his speed went down like 20 miles per hour.  Doesn't do that.  No?  It doesn't.  I kind of like that it went in.  Yeah.  No, I like that.  I kind of liked it.  It's a good format, but my presentation really stunk.  I think you knew that one was finished.  Yeah.  Because when you said he pushed his cigarette lighter in, and then you kept on trucking,  and then it tends to slow the car down 20 miles per hour.  I had to pick a speed.  Yeah, it really stunk.  My presentation blew.  It was just a little mixed up.  It was a good idea because I could picture Steve driving, and then the cigarette lighter, 
[01:24:00]  and then he slows down because of the battery.  Just the idea of Steve being rear-ended is funny in itself.  That's true.  You're so mean.  No, I love you, Steve.  Why don't you take it off there, Steve?  All right.  Oh, come on, Steve.  Come on, there you go.  All right, all right, all right.  I pushed that piece of shit out of here.  All right. 
[01:24:30]  All right, all right.  All right.  That's terrible, I'm sorry. 
[01:25:00]  The O.P. & Anthony Show remembers Steve C.  Hello, my name is Club Soda Kenny, and I will always remember Steve C. 
[01:25:30]  Steve C. was always a nice guy to me, and my condolences go out to his family.  The O.P. & Anthony Show remembers friend and producer Steve Carlisi.  And it is true. Steve C., who worked with the show for, I don't know, at least 10 years, died, and I'm sick about it.  Steve left behind a 2-year-old, a wife, and a stepdaughter who's 16 or 17, I believe.  To donate to Steve's family, it's tinyurl.com slash stevecfund. 
[01:26:00]  If you can give, great. If you can't, don't worry about it. We understand.  It's tinyurl.com slash stevecfund.  The O.P. & Anthony Show remembers friend and producer Steve Carlisi.  It's Mike Opelka, stunt brain, from the old days.  Everybody who's talked about Steve Carlisi has probably used the word unusual to describe him.  And while he was unusual, there are better words. 
[01:26:30]  Steve Carlisi was a loyal enigma.  He was fiercely loyal to O.P., Anthony, Jimmy, the entire show.  And while he argued with virtually everybody inside the O.N.A. complex,  he defended the place fiercely from all outside attacks.  And as far as being an enigma, an enigma is something that's puzzling,  something that's confusing, something that's difficult to understand.  Steve Carlisi was an enigma. 
[01:27:00]  I worked with Steve for a year, but we stayed in touch long after I left NEW  and long after he left Sirius XM.  And while we were competing for the same gigs many times,  we exchanged information and tried to help each other along the way.  I'll always respect him for that.  Rest in peace, Steve Carlisi.  You will be missed.  Let's go to Winston Churchill.  What? Winnie?  Well, actually, it's Charlie, and he has something that Winston Churchill said. 
[01:27:30]  I was going to say.  Charlie.  Good morning, boys.  Hello, Charlie.  Say it like Winston Churchill, please.  I can't do it, Winston Churchill.  Come on!  I'm sorry, Ant.  Try it.  I stink.  I'm sorry, I stink.  Boo.  Ant, you might like it.  Winston Churchill said,  a nation trying to tax itself into prosperity is like a man standing in a bucket trying to pick  himself up by the handle.  Pretty interesting, I think.  Ooh.  And that's what we're doing.  But that's impossible.  You can't do that. 
[01:28:00]  Exactly.  It's impossible.  That's a great line.  It is a great line.  That fucking Winston Churchill had some great lines.  I wonder if he had a writer.  He didn't have no writer.  But then he just like, he would just walk up and say things,  This is our finest hour.  Wow, it is.  That's fantastic.  But some schmuck wrote all that shit.  They've always had writers.  I don't know.  I think they always had writers.  I think Winnie came up with some quotes of his own. 
[01:28:30]  Why are you calling him Winnie?  That's what you call him, Winnie.  That's what they called him back then, Winnie.  What?  You're standing in a bucket.  What are you?  It's like, will you spackle?  Let's say hi to Steve down the hall.  Steve.  Steve down the hall.  Steve down the hall.  What's up?  Yes.  Yes, a nation trying to tax itself into prosperity is like drinking cum out of a bucket. 
[01:29:00]  How is that?  Because taxing yourself is delicious.  Never has one person done so little for so many.  Sorry.  Say hi to Stryker.  I may not agree with what you say, but I'll have another piece of cake.  There it is.  There it is.  Speak softly, but carry a big burger. 
[01:29:30]  I'm trying to get the answer to feedback working.  Does it work?  Four score and one giant logo a go.  The bucket stops here.  Stryker.  Stryker.  There is nothing to fear but hard work. 
[01:30:00]  I'll laugh at that one.  My only regret is I have but one burger to eat for breakfast.  I may not agree with what you say, but I'll die it for your right to say it.  I'll die it for your right to say it.  Ask not what your producer can do for you, because it's nothing. 
[01:30:30]  You just came up on that, I think.  Let's go to Cody in Indiana.  Cody!  Give me liberty or give me surgery.  A diet which will live in infamy.  Steve, for sure.  Give me liberty or give me cum.  Even if you give me liberty, I'd like some cum. 
[01:31:00]  I'll say cum or both, but not just liberty.  Liberty is nice, but not without cum, it's not.  Let them eat cum.  Steve from Bayshore.  Let them eat cum. 
[01:31:30]  We've got Steve on the phone with something.  Steve.  Holy shit.  Yes.  A cock in the hand is worth two in the bush.  No, those are just sayings.  No, we're going with the big political quotes.  Political quotes, my friend.  I should not seek nor should I accept another term as your producer.  Hey, Steve. 
[01:32:00]  God damn, Steve from Bayshore.  Let's go to Steve on the line.  A lot of Steve's checking in.  Steve from the moon.  Yes, Steve from the moon.  One small step for men, I'm tired.  One small step for men, one giant cock in my behind. 
[01:32:30]  Let's say hi to Steve calling in.  Steve, say yes, sir.  One is my land and the number two value meal.  All right, all right.  I kind of like that one.  Let's say hi to Steve.  Steve.  Four score and seven packs a go.  We've got Steve C on the line.  Steve C. 
[01:33:00]  Four courses and seven six-ish a go.  We've got Todd.  Todd, what's up?  The Bukkaki starts in five minutes.  Let's say hi to Dennis.  Dennis?  Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this closet wall.  Mr. Gorbachev, give me your balls.  A lot of Steve C's checking in. 
[01:33:30]  Steve C.  Give me liberty or give me Monday golf.  That's great.  We've got Steve C checking in.  Steve?  Steve?  Yes.  You're on the line.  Yes.  Yes.  I know Eric Nagel, sir, and you're no Eric Nagel.  All right.  A house divided against itself cannot stand. 
[01:34:00]  A stomach divided against itself will not stay small.  All right.  A man divided against his own sexuality cannot stand.  However, he can't kneel and grab his toes.  Steve C.  Check it in.  Steve.  Don't forget it.  Can you see the whites of your eyes and your cock is down my throat?  Oh, jeez. 
[01:34:30]  Come on.  There you go.  Let's go to Steve C.  Steve C.  Matt.  Eat.  Cheeseburger.  That's pretty good.  You guys want to talk to Steve C today?  Yes.  Is he on?  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Steve C.  Steve.  Hey, you won't have Steve Carlitti to push around anymore.  To err is human.  To be incompetent is divine. 
[01:35:00]  Oh, here's a good one.  Steve C.  Check it in.  Steve C.  Yes.  I could not have sex with that woman.  I could not.  I could not.  Ah, shit.  Can't find enough good quotes.  Oh, wow.  Steve C.  He's checking in.  He's got it.  Okay. 
[01:35:30]  Hi, Steve C.  What's up?  I have a dream of a cock that tastes like a cheeseburger.  See?  He had a dream, but.  Let's go to Steve C.  Steve C.  Hello?  Hello, Steve C.  Yes, Steve.  I want to probably spell potato.  C-O-C-K.  No, that's.  That's not even a quote.  It's a misstep.  The wheels are falling off.  Steve C., help us out here.  And that's how you effectively produce a glory hole. 
[01:36:00]  Oof.  I'm not going to hire American boys to do what Asian boys should be doing.  We might have to expand the bit with Steve C. on line one.  Steve C.  Down goes French fries.  Down goes French fries.  No, how about, down goes me.  Down goes me. 
[01:36:30]  Oh, shit.  Let's go to Steve C.  Steve C.  Yes.  I will suck a cock in space before this decade is out.  That's a card.  That's a card.  Let's go to.  One small step for a man.  One deep footprint.  With that, let's say hi to Steve C. 
[01:37:00]  Steve C.  Today, I consider myself the laziest man in the middle of the day.  Oh, that's a fucking good one.  All right.  Let's say hi to Steve C.  God damn it.  Let's say hi to Steve C.  Steve C.  Yes.  We have nothing to eat.  Buffet itself. 
[01:37:30]  The what itself?  Buffet.  Second buffet.  All right.  All right.  I take it.  I get it.  Steve C., what's up?  Hello.  Yes.  Read my lips and put some gum on them.  Let's say hi to Steve C.  Steve C.  Hey, this is Steve C.  From the Old North Church.  I just wanted to report that the British are coming.  The British are coming and it's delicious. 
[01:38:00]  Let's say hi to Steve C.  Steve C.  Yes.  Ask not what you can do for your radio show,  but what your radio show can pay you for your own videos.  I shall return on Tuesday.  Let's say hi to Steve C.  Steve C.  Yes.  Today is a day that will live on inside of me. 
[01:38:30]  We have Chip on the line.  Chip.  Yes.  Not Steve C.  Hey, I may not agree with what you say,  but you give me a little bunch of cupcakes or something.  It's really bad.  Wow, Chip.  How did you do that?  You can't get hung up on me. 
[01:39:00]  Let's say hi to Steve C.  I lied once.  Steve C.  Yes.  If you can't stand the heat,  stay in the closet.  No.  Regardless of conditions,  stay in the kitchen.  One if by land, 
[01:39:30]  two if by sexual.  What do you mean?  That's a good one.  That's very good.  The British are coming in.  It's delicious.  And it's delicious.  Oh, he's catching a fucking...  He's getting pummeled.  He's catching some fucking right hooks today.  Let's say hi to Steve C.  Steve C.  I'm ready for my cum shot,  Mr. DeVille. 
[01:40:00]  Let's go to Steve C.  On line seven.  Hi, Steve C.  Mr. Gorbachev,  come down my throat.  Jesus.  That's so unnoticed.  That was just blatant.  Yeah.  Let's go to Steve C.  Steve C.  Yes, read my lips.  I'm a faggot.  Let's go to Steve C.  Steve C.  Yes, a house divided against itself 
[01:40:30]  should be glued back together  with a little cub.  Steve C.  Steve C.  Hello?  Yes.  Hi, Steve.  It being I'm homosexual.  Let's go to Steve C.  On line four.  Steve, what do you got?  Glory, glory, hallelujah. 
[01:41:00]  It's fucking wrong.  Let's go to Steve C.  Steve.  One giant step for man  and two large oven mitts  for my canine.  The Opie Anthony Show remembers  Steve C.  Hi, this is Sean,  formerly of the Opie Anthony Show.  You might or probably  don't remember me as the butcher.  I now work for Liquid Metal  on Channel 40 here on Sirius XM  and I just wanted to take a quick moment 
[01:41:30]  to recollect on my friend and boss,  Steve Carlesi.  Steve was a great dude.  Working for O&A was my first ever job in radio  and Steve always gave me great advice  and pushed me to do the best  that I could creatively  with whatever it is I was working on.  He would always have a huge smile on his face  which, believe me,  is an incredibly hard task  working the crazy hours  that these guys do.  I can still remember  his loud, ridiculous cackle of a laugh  echoing through the office.  Thank you for everything, Steve.  You are a great guy  and you'll be dearly missed.  I wish his wife and son all the best.  My deepest apologies for your loss. 
[01:42:00]  Ah, good morning.  Wow, good morning, everybody.  I'm calling it right now.  Yeah?  Snowden!  Snowden!  Yeah!  Snowden!  You haven't done a Snowden show yet, Anthony.  No.  Snowden shows are the funnest  Opie and Anthony shows  that we could do.  The bestest ever.  The bestest ever  because guess what?  What?  It's a I don't give a fuck day  on the Opie and Anthony show.  Exactly.  Snowden!  Did we take roll call? 
[01:42:30]  Ah, you want to take roll call?  Oh, and a roll call.  Sound off now.  Sam!  Here.  Travis!  Present!  How about Danny?  He's down the hall.  He just made it in, though,  but he made it.  Yay!  Butcher!  Butcher made it.  Yay!  E-Rock!  E-Rock!  Made it.  Yay!  Steve Carlesi!  Hold on. 
[01:43:00]  Hold on.  Wait for it.  Wait for it.  Wait for it.  Wait for it.  Wait for it.  Wait for it.  Wait for it.  Yeah, the executive producer  of the Opie and Anthony show  had a real tough time getting in.  For the rest of America, it's a goddamn mess in the tri-state area. 
[01:43:30]  It is awful out there.  Yes.  I mean, it really is.  It is probably one of the worst winter storms we've seen in quite some time.  It is just a disaster out there.  We don't even have to be here.  That's why it's snow day.  Not even supposed to be here today.  Not even supposed to be.  But Steve started emailing everybody at what?  4, 4.30?  Steve Carlesi's day off again. 
[01:44:00]  Didn't we do that, Ben?  Yeah, we're going to have to redo it, I guess.  Stupid Steve didn't make it in.  No, he sent me an email.  And wait until you hear what Kenny's replacement did to get in here today.  Because that story is nothing less than fucking, like, he should get the Congressional Medal of Honor.  Here's Steve's subject line.  Who is going to have problems slash delays getting in? 
[01:44:30]  And he goes, and I'm stuck.  Made it about 100 feet down the road.  This sucks.  And then Steve Carlesi.  He wrote that from his bed.  Yeah, yeah.  100 feet down the road.  It wasn't snowing where I was.  But then 100 feet away.  My goodness, a blizzard.  Yeah, no one goes 100 feet.  100 feet.  You either don't go at all, or you go all the way, right? 
[01:45:00]  Yes.  You don't just go 100 feet.  My Prius only went 100 feet, and the battery died.  I swear to you.  I gave it my all.  I gave it to try.  Interns that don't even get paid made it in.  Yes.  But Steve, the executive producer of the Open Anthony Show.  I made it 100 feet.  Wait, I'm checking in.  I made it 110 feet.  I'll be there in July.  Like, Steve should be the only one here today. 
[01:45:30]  Only one here, only one not here.  Sam made it all the way from, I don't know where the fuck he lives, way out in the woods  somewhere.  Westchester.  Sam and Travis made an interesting, they had an insightful little thing on this whole  snow transportation thing.  What was it?  Choo-choo go in snow.  Choo-choo go in snow.  So, as long as you can get to a choo-choo, you can make it into work.  And in the city, choo-choo's pretty available.  Well, I don't know about that.  It's not like this is the greatest city in the whole damn world. 
[01:46:00]  Oh, with one of the biggest subway systems?  Right.  Oh, fucking Steve.  Hey, Danny Ross!  Hey!  I'll tell you, I almost didn't make it in.  It is insane.  We're not saying it's not ugly out there.  Dude, I thought about turning around about three or four times.  Insane, right?  And I hit that point of no return, and I was just like, you made it this far, dude.  You just gotta go.  But see, you have to come in on these days, because it's a snow day show.  Snow day.  Remember the last snow day show?  We had Jimmy and E-Rock running around the place in bunny outfits or whatever. 
[01:46:30]  In bunny outfits.  The hoodie footie snuggle suit.  Yeah.  The hoodie footie snuggle suit.  Oh, shit.  What?  He did?  Troy!  Troy!  Troy!  Troy!  Troy!  Troy!  Troy!  Troy!  Troy!  Troy!  Troy!  Troy!  Troy!  Troy!  Troy!  Troy!  Troy!  Troy!  Troy!  Troy!  He could end up the only one that didn't make it is the executive producer.  Oh, boy.  That's not good.  Oh, my God.  That's not good.  I mean, you know how I don't like to defend Steve ever?  But, I mean, he does drive the most faggatiest car on the face of the earth.  He certainly does.  It's a strange defense.  With that, Danny, I'm about to tell my story.  Well, first, let me just say... 
[01:47:00]  This isn't going to help Steve at all.  Janine just wrote, and that's how you executive excuse.  Very good.  And, also, E-Rock was already able to drive in from Jersey, so I don't think in a snowstorm  more than one person can drive in from Jersey.  Can drive in.  I think that's the problem.  Well, that's where the wall of snow must have fallen 100 feet from his house.  Right behind E-Rock.  So, when Kenny's not here, he has this guy, Chris, who replaces him.  Yep.  And Chris is probably the nicest guy I've ever met in my life. 
[01:47:30]  I mean, he is like...  That isn't even an exaggeration.  He is so nice, so mellow, nothing bothers this guy.  He's about to kill somebody.  Yeah.  That's how bad it is outside.  So, when Steve wrote that he made it 100 feet, and then he said, screw this, and gave  up, well, Chris's story's a little different.  Here, he's coming down the hall.  Yeah.  Chris...  I don't know if he's lying down there.  Chris told me that to make sure that he was going to be able to come in today, he plowed 
[01:48:00]  his driveway three times.  Now, he lives in, I think...  He can't be on the air probably.  No, no.  Where do you live?  Northern Jersey?  Yeah, he lives...  Yeah, yeah.  He lives north.  He lives in the place that just got pounded by this.  There's over two feet of snow where you live.  Yeah.  Two feet of snow.  Easily, right?  Okay, so he's coming from an area that's gotten two feet of snow.  In New York right now, we're up to about nine.  Nine inches.  Yeah, and it's...  So, west and north are where it's just completely a disaster. 
[01:48:30]  No sign of stopping either, by the way.  No.  So, he...  Well, Steve's on the line.  Jesus Christ.  Oh, no.  Hold on a minute.  You're messing up my story.  I apologize.  I just wanted to call in and give the faggot and competent executive producer reasoning  for not being there.  Oh, I thought we were doing a good job of that.  No, no.  You were doing a horrible misrepresentation. 
[01:49:00]  Oh.  So, Steve, why can't you make it in even though everybody else on the Opie and Anthony staff  made it in?  If I lived...  I saw...  I had to be not...  The audience saw it coming.  The audience saw that coming.  Stop it!  Stop it!  Stop it!  Yes!  Oh, shit.  I ain't listening to his horseshit today.  Dude, I saw LOLs popping up on this screen when you started asking the question. 
[01:49:30]  Fuck that.  Holy motherfuckers.  See, people...  Here's why.  See, if you...  I'm pissed off right now.  Oh, he's freaking out.  The Opie and Anthony Show remembers Steve C.  Hello, this is Stop it Patty, and I'm here to reminisce about Steve, our dear friend.  And I always remember him as a very, very nice person.  He was like a teddy bear. 
[01:50:00]  You know, I guess Steve the bear.  You know, that's my impression.  He was always nice to me, and, you know, it's just hard, you know, to say goodbye to someone that you like a lot, you know?  You know, I guess, you know, he did everything that he had to do on this earth.  And to me, he's with God.  He's in a better place. 
[01:50:30]  He's not suffering anymore.  And we're all going to miss him.  I'm going to miss him dearly.  Hi, this is Coke Logic, contributor to The Opie and Anthony Show and longtime listener.  Over the years, I've done animation for this show, and I always knew it was going to be good if Steve C. was going to make an appearance.  Simply because Steve C. had the sunglasses on top of his head, the sleeveless black shirt, arm tattoos, and a flaming logo on his chest.  The look he created in life was perfect for a cartoon character, because Steve C. was instantly identifiable, even if it was a cameo in the background without dialogue. 
[01:51:00]  And the fun part about animating Steve is he was mostly reaction shots.  You have people from the show tearing into Steve, Anthony with some sideways compliments,  and then Jim with a borderline mean-spirited, hilarious comment.  And then you would cut to Steve C.'s reaction shot, just looking down like, when is this over, or rolling his eyes.  Because Steve knew it was good radio to just stay there and take it for the show.  And that's how I imagined his reaction. 
[01:51:30]  Steve was an amazingly nice guy, and I was glad to have met him.  It's a terrible shame, but I can't imagine I'll ever forget him.  Hey guys, this is Pat from Monarchy.  We're all going to miss Steve C.  He was a great guy, and in a mental case, like the rest of us O&A fans.  He was always supportive of my buffoonery, and as far as I'm concerned, he'll forever be the voice of the O.B. and Anthony show.  Ramon, you were officially released from your servitude. 
[01:52:00]  Take it easy, Steve.  Goodbye.  Hey, this is Steve from Bayshore.  I just wanted to say a couple of things about Steve C.  The first time I really dealt with him was when I had written and recorded a song for Little Jimmy, spoofing Elvis' version of My Way.  The song was called My Aids, and it was not a hit with Steve C.  I was not insulted by that, but the song sort of fell by the wayside for a few days,  until Club Soda Kenny brought it to the show's attention, and they called Steve in to ask him about it.  He said he didn't like it, and the guys played it and liked it. 
[01:52:30]  So, later in that day, Steve emailed me saying,  Oh, dear, I'm sorry.  I was wrong.  Or something to that effect.  And I thought that was pretty cool of him.  So, we struck up a little correspondence every now and again.  Eventually, I was hired to write the show rundown for K-Rock.  I had to deal with Steve once in a while.  And he also hired me to do some writing for his FoundryMusic.com website.  We worked on a couple of little animation scripts together. 
[01:53:00]  And I had a really good time with the guy.  Every time I saw him, he was really nice to me.  Very cool, very easy to laugh, and was genuinely a nice guy.  I really have nothing but good memories of Steve C.,  and I'll miss talking to the guy every so often.  He was really a nice guy, and my thoughts go out to his family and friends.  Thanks for listening.  Hey, this is the gate.  I'm a regular on the Open Hands show.  He always made me laugh with Steve. 
[01:53:30]  He always had videos for real, and had to be retold.  And also, it also adds an impression of Steve.  Steve is really very funny. 
[01:54:00]  I can tell them to Steve and Carlisi and his family.  You will be missed.  Goodbye.  The Open Anthony Show remembers friend and producer Steve Carlisi.  And it is true.  Steve C., who worked for this show for, I don't know, at least 10 years, died.  And I'm sick about it. 
[01:54:30]  Steve left behind a 2-year-old, a wife, and a stepdaughter who's 16 or 17, I believe.  To donate to Steve's family, it's tinyurl.com slash stevecfund.  If you can give, great.  If you can't, don't worry about it.  We understand.  It's tinyurl.com slash stevecfund.  The Open Anthony Show remembers Steve C.  Hey, it's Sam Roberts, of course.  Steve was the guy who I knew from the very beginning of working with O&A.  He was actually the guy who interviewed me when I was just trying to be an intern. 
[01:55:00]  And he was the one who I pestered to get the internship.  And when I finally got here, he was the one who I pestered most days.  He could take a joke, though, better than anybody who I've ever encountered.  He was willing to throw himself under the bus for the betterment of the show  more than anybody who's ever been associated with the show.  And that's because he liked to laugh.  Like, he enjoyed having a good time. 
[01:55:30]  Even if the laugh was at his expense, even if he was angry at first or frustrated at first,  eventually Steve would always be there laughing with you.  The worse you got him, the harder he laughed.  Eventually, but he did laugh.  He was the first person.  He was the guy who made me into the sort of shit stirrer that I've become on the show.  Because when I was young, he saw me kind of just goofing off in the office all day.  And he sat me down one day and he said, Sam, seriously, you have got to stop fucking around. 
[01:56:00]  That's what he said.  He said, you have got to stop fucking around.  He said, you know, you're goofing around and it's becoming a distraction.  Unless what you're doing is going to be something that is brought to the air, then you need to not fuck around anymore.  And I said, okay, Steve, that's understandable.  And from that moment on, and Steve was fully with it.  I said, so that means that if I am going to bring it to the air, I can still goof around.  And he said, of course.  And he meant every word of it, too. 
[01:56:30]  Because I didn't stop goofing around.  I just brought everything to the air.  And Steve was happy with that.  I mean, there was every character I've ever done just about, from A.J. Poopy Shits to the inventor in Epstein to all of this stuff was stuff that Steve basically forced me into a studio to do.  Because he wanted all this creative energy to be put on the air because he knew that's what would be best for the show.  And that's what would be funniest.  If it was throwing me under the bus, if it was throwing himself under the bus, Steve was okay with it as long as what turned out was a funny product. 
[01:57:00]  But we all miss Steve here.  And we're all saddened by everything.  I hope that you're enjoying this special as much as I am.  And I hope that everybody sort of understands now, you know, in hindsight, that as many laughs as we had that sort of seemed like they were at Steve's expense, Steve was having them with us.  And the laughter was the reaction that he wanted. 
[01:57:30]  So thank you for everything, Steve.  Hey, Anthony, we've got to get Steve in here.  He's working on our coming or going game.  Uh-huh.  Steve, how's the coming or going game going?  Hands tucked it up to the nipples.  Coming, uh...  Jesus, Steve.  Pull the shirt out.  It's a medium.  God.  He's a tuck kind of guy.  Stop tucking.  That looks so much better untucked, little v-neck.  I...  Stop tucking.  Nothing I do.  That looks good.  Everything I do, everything I wear.  Back off the mic a little bit.  I like that.  I like that.  That's the loose guy.  Yeah, much better. 
[01:58:00]  You're making us all very uncomfortable.  You really like to tuck that shirt all the way in.  What are you hiding, a bomb belt?  We should make a shirt up for him that says, go tuck yourself.  That natured shirt.  That's what I told you to tuck your mother.  At least he's...  Boom, bang.  At least he doesn't have any flames on his attire today.  I bet you these boxers do.  He sent me an email yesterday.  He got all excited because on eBay they're selling boots with flames.  Yeah.  And you want to make a bid on those, don't you? 
[01:58:30]  Not, Henry.  I'm trying to tuck this broad.  Here's a little help here.  Too broad.  It doesn't like big, thick Lebanese fingers.  Every day.  It never gets old.  You got big tattooed tucker.  All right, so how's the coming or going game going?  It's going well.  You think we'll do it today?  No, we won't do it today.  I actually have a good stash at home that I have to pull for three.  Oh, wow.  All right.  No, it's got to be good. 
[01:59:00]  I mean, we're going to have to find more stuff.  As I'm doing this, I'm going to do it.  Are we going to have it on Skull Shirt Day or Flame Shirt Day?  Flame Shirt Day.  But you know what?  Even Skull and Flame Shirt Day are roll up the edge of the shirt sleeve and iron it day.  Is there any reason?  Is there any reason?  I wish people in Radioland could see the fact that this sociopath is wearing a black t-shirt  and he rolls up the part of the edge of the black sleeve and then irons it so there's  like a little cuff on it.  That's to show off those big bicep.  Look at that side. 
[01:59:30]  I've spent months getting my arms tattooed.  Why not show them off?  I know, but you only do it a quarter inch.  Just get a tank top.  Show off the arm.  He probably measures it with a tape measure.  You know why?  Because I walk in here with a tank top and it's more ammunition.  I wouldn't make fun of your tank top.  That's true.  Yeah.  Right.  You know the pressure now every day.  He probably wakes up and looks at the shirts and goes, no, I can't even do it.  No, I know I'm going to catch up with this one.  If I cared enough what Jim thought, you know, do you realize the irony in me taking wardrobe  criticism from you?  Ah, good.  Now you've got to give him credit for that one. 
[02:00:00]  I can't even argue with it.  I'm an awful dresser.  Yes.  But I'm acknowledging I'm an awful dresser.  But see, yeah, Norton's not trying, though.  He doesn't care.  It seems like you've got something going on here.  I've got a look going.  You're trying for a look.  You really are trying for a look.  I don't care what Jim thinks of my look.  How does it feel that when you pull into a gas station, people run?  I don't even know what that meant.  Because there's flames.  I got it.  Yeah, of course you did. 
[02:00:30]  I carried the two.  I did the math problem.  That was good.  All right.  Just wait until you see the boots.  That's what I did.  Are you really going to get the boots?  I already got them.  Not the ones I showed you last night.  They didn't have those on my side.  You've got to come in to work with the flaming boots.  Yeah, the area of the...  When are you moving to Chelsea, by the way?  They're shipped in from...  He needs a roadster.  He's the kind of guy that would drive a roadster with the flames on it.  Yeah, I would.  The look is perfect to get out of that.  We've got to get him on American Chopper.  Yeah, yeah.  You're perfect for American Chopper.  He's the type of guy you see holding hands with another guy, but not in one of those hardcore 
[02:01:00]  male fist clubs.  Oh, wow.  The type of guys...  I didn't see that coming.  The type of guys that shake hands like this.  How you doing?  And then kiss deep in the middle of the street.  Oh.  Oh.  I'm not knocking them.  I'm just saying that those...  You ever see those guys?  Like those...  Those are the gay guys that you know...  Yeah.  Anthony and I see those guys all...  What?  Yeah, yeah.  Where the fuck did you get that?  You never saw the guys at the leather bar, guys?  Only in that movie that Pacino was in, Cruisin'. 
[02:01:30]  Oh, that was...  Yeah.  We were at the yellow hiker chips.  Yeah.  It's like watching.  And you know he's got some flaming shoes The kind that Pyra would admire  It makes contestants bring in food And it runs the Foundry Music Empire  Martini Steve's clothes are on fire Martini Steve's clothes are on fire  He only buys flaming attire  His clothing's like a barbecue His laundry never needs a dryer 
[02:02:00]  If you're selling burning shoes This drunken Lebanese will fire  Martini Steve's clothes are on fire Martini Steve's clothes are on fire  He only buys flaming attire  You know he's got some flaming shoes The kind that Satan would desire 
[02:02:30]  If you're with him drinking booze The smoke detector is required  Martini Steve's clothes are on fire Martini Steve's clothes are on fire  He only buys flaming attire He only buys flaming attire  Martini Steve's clothes are on fire 
[02:03:00]  Martini Steve's clothes are on fire  The O.P. Anthony show remembers Friend and Producer Steve Carlesi  Hey, it's Don Wickland from Sirius XM  I was ONA's program director from 2005 till the merger, and of course worked with Steve C. and the crew for all those years. 
[02:03:30]  Many good years, a few bad ones, but great memories from live broadcasts.  I remember working with the entire crew, and of course with Jimmy and Open Ant.  Steve was my go-to executive producer for most of those years.  He made sure the producers did their jobs, they provided the best show prep for Opie and Anthony,  and every day, every night, Steve and I would talk, and it wasn't just about work, it was about life. 
[02:04:00]  It was about how happy he was with MJ, it was how the world revolved around her,  and the day he found out that he was going to be a dad.  And I remember he called me and he let me know as soon as he heard the news.  You could see a brand new Steve emerge from the rubble of the daily grind of work.  For once, it was like work was put on the back burner and his life was all that mattered. 
[02:04:30]  I think a lot of days we spent bitching about work, and the staff, and the issues with the channel,  and the frustrations of getting legal to sign off on every stunt we wanted to,  but we pushed, and we pushed legal, and we made it through with a lot of the stuff that the guys wanted to do.  And, you know, that's what I miss about Steve.  He was passionate. He was a go-getter. 
[02:05:00]  He lived for the show, and he made me a proud program director.  I think one of my favorite times with Steve is we were out of our element,  and away from work at one of the most perfect settings.  It was one of the most relaxing days ever.  It was Opie's wedding in Philly.  I remember it like yesterday.  Sitting at our table with our wives, smiling from ear to ear as we had the perfect life. 
[02:05:30]  We had the perfect wives, happy as hell, and then sharing that day with the staff,  and, of course, with Opie and Lindsay.  For one day, we didn't think about work.  We thought about life, how great it was to spend time outside of our jobs,  just having the greatest time ever at one of the most beautiful weddings to date.  And all I can see in my mind is Steve looking at MJ, just smiling, dancing, 
[02:06:00]  making a fool out of himself because he did suck at dancing.  But he was the happiest guy in the world.  It's those good memories that you never want to forget.  It's the pictures that still remain in my mind.  It's good people like Steve that will never be forgotten.  We love you, Steve.  We miss you, man.  The Opie and Anthony show remembers friend and producer Steve Carlisi.  And it is true.  Steve C., who worked with the show for, I don't know, at least 10 years, died. 
[02:06:30]  And I'm sick about it.  Steve left behind a 2-year-old, a wife, and a stepdaughter who's 16 or 17, I believe.  To donate to Steve's family, it's tinyurl.com slash stevecfun.  If you can give, great.  If you can't, don't worry about it.  We understand.  It's tinyurl.com slash stevecfun.  The Opie and Anthony show remembers friend and producer Steve Carlisi.  Something happened this week that was very disturbing to all of us, and it was the passing of our friend, Steve Carlisi. 
[02:07:00]  When I first got involved with XM202, the first person I emailed, and I can't remember exactly how it went down, but I emailed Steve.  And he answered me right back, which spoiled me because I wrote to Anthony and never got an answer.  I got no answer.  I wrote to Opie, mailbox full.  But every time I would email Steve, he would always email me back. 
[02:07:30]  And we kind of, we didn't, I can't say that we struck up a friendship real early on, but we had this correspondence going.  And he was a nice guy, and it didn't matter how trivial the email was, he always responded to me.  And, you know, then I sort of got hooked up with Jim Norton when we were talking about something.  He talked about this on the air so I can say it.  He had a lump on his nut or something.  I can't remember.  In his scrotum, I can't remember what it was. 
[02:08:00]  You don't remember what it was, but you can talk about it on the air.  Well, but he talked about it on the air, so.  Right, whatever it was.  So whatever it was, it's okay for me to mention that we talked about it.  But that's how he and I started talking.  And when Opie put out that message that if a fan had an idea for a show, let them know and they'll consider it,  the first person I went to was Steve Carlesi.  And he got back to me within five minutes of my emailing him.  And his response was, I like the idea a lot. 
[02:08:30]  Let me see what I can do.  And the rest is history.  There would be no weird medicine if it wasn't for Steve C.  And, you know, any time we went up there, Steve always went out of his way to say hello to us.  Yeah.  Even when I dragged all you other assholes up there.  I mean, you know, he came and said hello.  To all of us.  And he was busy, but he always made time.  And he was just a very, very nice guy.  So, we're going to really miss him.  You know, stuff like this happens.  It's just, you know, he's too young.  He's got a kid and a wife and a stepdaughter. 
[02:09:00]  And, you know, it just kind of took everybody broadside.  So, he will be greatly missed.  The Opie and Anthony Show remembers Steve C.  Remembering our good friend Steve Carlisi.  Steve C., former producer of The Opie and Anthony Show.  My name is A-Rock.  Thank you for checking this out in this segment here.  This has been a long time coming.  We knew about this, that he had this, and nobody really decided to explore it until one day Steve decided to bring this in. 
[02:09:30]  The official CD of the band Foundry.  Now, Foundry was Steve's band back up in Boston in the mid to late 90s, which led to Foundry Music.  It used to be a band site, and then he just kept the name and turned it into the global enterprise that it became.  But this was the album for the band Foundry that nobody has ever heard up until this point.  So, of course, ONA, you know, we go through the CD, we go through the lyrics, then we play what became extremely popular worldwide because of the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:10:00]  We broke this record, Pendulum.  This is the debut of Pendulum, the debut of Foundry.  There's a lot of material that came from the playing of this album, and this song alone eventually led to a Pendulum cover song contest and just would always be brought up at the weirdest times.  Steve C., Foundry Music, Pendulum, right now.  Steve, where's your music?  Yeah.  Here it comes.  He goes right here.  Oh, he looks so sad. 
[02:10:30]  Oh, come on, Foundry.  No energy.  He's like, oh, it's right here.  Where is it?  Give me that CD.  Before he thinks about taking it back.  No, I can't take it back.  I want to enjoy the whole CD.  Give it to me.  All right.  The cover art.  The name of the CD you guys put out was What Kills Me?  That's right.  Our own Steve.  Very aggressive.  And you were the singer?  Uh-huh.  Why not?  How'd your parents die?  Why not? 
[02:11:00]  How'd your parents die?  Why not?  How'd your parents die?  I'm never talking to you again, Jimmy.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  Did you hand this CD to Aunt and I when we were working at AAF?  I might have.  I think I, uh...  Probably.  Well, because I was...  I have a group called Foundry.  It was very hard to find and navigate.  Come here.  Oh, oh, oh.  I probably did because I used to work those beach parties that you guys did at, what was that, Fitchburg Center?  Fitchburg.  Fitchburg.  Whatever that stupid indoor hockey arena was where you guys...  Oh, the indoor beach party in Fitchburg, Massachusetts. 
[02:11:30]  Because I would work security at those things.  Where's all the other guys with Mullis?  Could you just give this a listen?  I guarantee you, Steve right now is secretly hoping that there's a big talent scout listening.  No, I'm not.  Who will recognize that Foundry was a band that was overlooked?  Trust me.  I've heard enough, I've heard enough, uh, demo CDs and befriended enough of the guys that I grew up listening to to know that this is not going to be.  Isn't it exciting, though, when you finally get the package in your hand and you're a band and you're like, here it is, man.  It's going to make it, man.  You guys all listen and tap your toes. 
[02:12:00]  At the time, ten years ago, yeah, you're ecstatic.  You're like, wow.  Guys, you guys want to look at this closely.  Oh, no, what?  I'm bummed that you guys don't have thank yous.  Yeah, those are always fun.  But, Steve, would you like to let everyone know what your rock name was?  Oh, my God.  Oh, yeah.  Steven Carr.  That's right.  Ooh.  Let me clarify one thing.  Oh, boy.  I forgot about that.  If I find out, if you spell the C-A-R-R, I'm going to smash arms into your face. 
[02:12:30]  Yes, I did.  Fucking cuss.  Grr.  Grr.  Steve hybrid it is now.  Steve Carr.  Let me try to start myself.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  I'm out of gas.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  This is Steve Carr on vocals.  Ah.  I forgot about that.  Steve Carr.  Steve Carr.  Oh, was Steve's douche taken? 
[02:13:00]  Yeah.  Everybody in the band had, like, a very antiseptic, cool-ass name, and I was the one guinea in the group.  Oh, no, Steve Carr.  I had to fit in.  Carr, yay.  Oh, that's wonderful.  Fucking horrendous.  It's better than Steve Leasy.  Oh, exactly.  Steve Lisi or Steve Carr.  It's a good name.  It's a good name.  I Lisi.  Hold on. 
[02:13:30]  I got to tell myself.  It was a good one, too.  You bastard.  Steve Carr.  I wish I would have seen that.  I didn't care.  Well, there it is right there.  C-A-R-R.  R-R.  Boundary is Stephen Carr.  Lead vocals and guitar.  Stephen Carr.  I bet you're a dummy.  Stephen Carr.  Scott, this is autographed.  Steve Carr.  Oh, I did.  I used to.  The last two R's trailed off.  No, but he used to intersect every other letter, I think.  Yeah, it was awful.  It's Steve Carr. 
[02:14:00]  Carr.  Steve Carr.  Grr.  Steve Carr.  Carr.  Thank you, sweetie.  No, I don't want to read it.  Oh, let's see your autograph.  Come on, Steve Carr.  Oh, back then?  We should do old-time concert commercials.  No, it's fine.  We're foundry.  Steve Carr.  Steve Carr.  Featuring Steve Carr.  Carr, Carr.  How many times did you rehearse the speech at the Grammys?  They normally don't recognize this kind of music.  I'm sure I had those conversations with myself, like, you know, in the shower or at night. 
[02:14:30]  When I win that Grammy.  Large boy.  Yeah, all 400 pounds of me.  All right, Steve.  All right, Steve.  Imagining, like, Jeopardy, having a question, like, this lead singer of a popular band is  actually named Steve Carr-Lisi.  And everyone knows it.  Who is Steve Carr?  Steve Carr is correct.  That's right.  Steve Carr.  This band actually put out one CD, and it sucks a bag of ass.  Who's Steve Carr?  Wow.  This was everything to this guy back in 97. 
[02:15:00]  Oh, yeah.  Hey, what song should we play?  Steve Carr should have gone to the junkyard to be crushed.  Steve Carr should have carried Harry Chapman on his back.  Steve Carr should have baby seats in the back backing into a lake.  Steve Carr should have a hose taped to the side of his face.  Oh, it's really awful. 
[02:15:30]  Steve Carr.  Steve Carr.  I used to wear these awful get-ups with, uh, I had, since I was so big, I couldn't buy  stage clothes in normal, I couldn't buy off the rack, so I was going to Lane Bryant,  the fat woman.  Oh, my God.  That's that woman's job.  Steve Carr gets his clothes from me, Lane Bryant.  We'll tell you more in this issue of Tiger Beat.  And I had this, uh, yes, indeed.  Oh, God.  Damn.  How did this go so long?  How long have we known Steve?  Ah, Steve.  Yeah, I have kept this intentionally. 
[02:16:00]  Eight years?  Very, yeah.  Eight years I've kept this muffled.  Oh, my God.  All right, so you would go to Lane Bryant, and what would you buy for your crazy stage  outfit?  A 3X leopard skin blouse.  Holy shit.  Oh, I had that.  I had, uh, I had gold sequined Doc Martens.  I had, uh...  You're divine.  Yeah.  You are divine.  Yeah. 
[02:16:30]  I think...  I think I had a...  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  It's more than terrible.  Oh, my girl wants to borrow my shirt all the time.  Oh, my God.  Steve Carr.  Oh, you stink.  It was awful.  I had...  I wore black eyeliner when I was, uh...  Oh, my God.  We got to blow up the lyrics, because they're really ridiculous.  Oh, are there lyrics?  Why didn't I look at that?  Oh, yeah.  Because you're too... 
[02:17:00]  You're just not observant, Jimmy.  What kills me?  Wow.  Music by Stephen Carr.  Lyrics by Stephen Carr.  Ew, you were Stephen Carr?  Stephen Carr.  Like Stephen Tyler?  Right.  It's hard to read.  Stephen Hawking Stephen King?  Did you think about it?  Should it be Steve Carr or Stephen Carr?  What was the big...  I probably did.  What was the big hit?  What kills me?  Uh...  I'm trying to think.  Yeah, that was one of them.  The hit.  That was the hit.  I want to live.  I want to dream.  I want to fly.  I want to die.  I think there was one. 
[02:17:30]  I think the one that was called Tell Your Story was the one that...  And by hit, we are just leaving the S off the front.  Yeah, exactly.  They're all crap.  Please blow up the lyrics so we can hear it.  We can sing along.  And the course of my existence isn't yours to compromise.  How's it written by?  I want to love.  I want to hate.  I want to punch a girl in her vagina.  I want to do promos that nobody gets.  I want to turn and deviate.  Play the hit Ramon. 
[02:18:00]  Bring me a cloth.  A little taste.  What song do you want us to play?  You can play the first one.  That's fine.  Pendulum?  Yeah.  Pendulum.  They all have long...  As performed by Stephen Carr in the band Boundary.  Swings back and forth like a pair of balls when you're wearing a Lane Bryant dress.  It was a blouse, Jimmy.  A blouse.  Stephen Carr.  Stephen Carr.  Wow. 
[02:18:30]  We're waiting for the lyrics to be blown up.  Okay.  We want to sing along.  Oh, people are just...  They're suggesting Photoshop's now that are just...  I'm sure.  I kept this so under wraps for so long.  I knew that it was going to happen.  Ted Kennedy should drive you into Chappaquiddick.  Steve Carr crash.  Oh, man.  Strap in.  Yeah, just strap in. 
[02:19:00]  I remember Jimmy...  When I told Jimmy about this, he looked at me and he just was laughing.  I said, what are you laughing about?  He said, I'm just trying to decide if we're going to get one or three hours out of this.  You knew it had to be.  You're getting thrown into the car.  What are the rest of the boys doing in the band?  I think one of them is still playing in bands in Boston.  The other guys all had day jobs.  And that's what kept everybody in Boston.  And I was just like, I don't want to do this anymore.  And I moved back to Jersey. 
[02:19:30]  Because it was just...  The scene in Boston was Godsmack and everybody else at that point.  I think Stained was just starting up at that point, too.  Godsmack and Foundry would be a good...  Foundry.  I think so, too.  Sully and Stephen Carr posing for a magazine.  Stephen Carr.  If only.  That's what he wanted.  Yeah, that's what you want.  That's what you wanted, right?  At 22, that's what I wanted.  I wanted to be...  I thought I wanted to be a rock star.  And then I came to the realization that everybody...  You get copies for everybody?  Godsmack and Goddreck. 
[02:20:00]  Here, Jimmy.  God, you've been blown up.  The lyrics are beyond tiny.  Very tiny.  Had to fit all of my creativity in a very small...  Oh, we were broke.  We recorded this in two days in a...  I think it was in Austin or something like that.  Some studio.  All right.  Here's the lyrics.  So we're going to play Pendulum?  Yeah, you can play Foundry?  That's right.  With Stephen Carr on...  All these songs are pretty vocals.  You guys ever play a show?  Yeah, a bunch.  Did you?  Yeah.  All right.  Here we go.  I don't even get the first line.  What's the first line? 
[02:20:30]  Pendulum will swing at the center of attention.  Just another day...  Condescension.  Another condescension.  Oh, just another...  It says day...  Mock you, shock you.  Gonna lock you down.  All right, wait a minute.  Pendulum will swing at the center of attention.  How does a pendulum swing?  Everyone's looking at it swing?  I guess, yeah.  All right.  Did you just look for things that rhymed?  No, I did have a rhyming dictionary.  Pendulum will shift with a little bit of pressure. 
[02:21:00]  Move too slow, and the pendulum will get you.  It's the pendulum that will get you.  Show you, mow you.  Gonna throw you around.  Ew.  Show you, mow you.  Mow you.  How appropriate.  Maybe we shouldn't pay this place.  You did the...  God, I can't take this picture of you, though.  It should have been Stephen as big as a...  Wait till you see line three.  This is where the writing gets good, Stephen.  Oh, okay.  You did the crime, but not the time. 
[02:21:30]  You went there, didn't you?  You did the crime.  Don't do the crime if you can.  Do the time.  What was the crime you committed?  Impersonating a retarded person writing lyrics?  Now you gotta pay for what you've done.  You better run.  I've had all I can take of all your screaming in my ear.  My back is gonna break if you push...  Push me in the rear.  Push it in my rear.  If you push me one more time. 
[02:22:00]  It doesn't even rhyme.  It does.  If you hear the rhyme scheme at all.  My back is gonna break.  Exactly.  My heart's getting heavy.  My blood's getting cold.  I was 22.  It's like one of Jimmy's poems.  It really is.  You make me look like fucking mammoth.  No, I don't.  I wasn't a poet, but you get it.  You changed me into something that I just can't control.  If you see me coming, best get out of my way.  Got no choice in the matter.  Yeah, exactly. 
[02:22:30]  Shaped like a bulldozer.  If you see me coming, put on certain glasses and you'll see me pass in front of the sun.  Oh, shit.  Because the pendulum is swinging back the other way.  Pendulum can take only so much yelling, but he'll do next.  What he'll do next?  What he'll do next.  There's no telling.  There's no telling.  Like dog shit, this song is smelling.  Bump you, chump you, gonna dump you out. 
[02:23:00]  Pendulum will break under too much tension, breaking down the walls of my detention.  Wrecking, balling, kingdom falling down.  And that is all the words to Pendulum.  So now you can follow along at home with the actual music from the band Foundry, ladies and gentlemen.  Listen to the words.  Is there a little intro music?  Yeah, all of our songs had very long intros.  Very long intros.  Electric drum triggers and all that.  Oh, great. 
[02:23:30]  What did you play, Sweetie Pie?  Guitar.  Eric.  Here's the man.  As that tiny little thing in front of me would indicate.  Oh, I see.  Blown up bigger.  And so is Steve in this picture.  Wow, you are just a shell of your former self.  I am so proud to look at you now.  Thank you, Anthony.  When you were giant.  How much did you weigh back then?  $1,650.  Pushing $400.  I mean, at that point, who's counting?  I really was huge.  I have like a 50-inch waist, I think.  All right.  Oh, Pendulum.  Okay, good.  All right, here we go. 
[02:24:00]  Get ready to rock.  Cut off the top of Pendulum.  Here it is, people.  It's Foundry.  On the only station that really rocks.  This is Foundry.  Pendulum.  Featuring Stephen Carr on lead vocals and guitar.  Stephen Carr going to be joining us in studio later on.  Crack, get on.  He's talking about his new album.  This is Pendulum on the only station that really rocks. 
[02:24:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Pendulum will swing at the center of the mansion.  Just another day, another garden adventure.  Love you and shot you and shot you.  This is so good.  I love Christmas.  Here it comes. 
[02:25:00]  Here it comes.  Now you've got to pay for what you've done.  You let around me.  That all I can say is the longest screaming in my ear.  Back is gonna break me.  Jump with me one more thing.  My heart is dead, man.  I'm looking at it cold.  You changed me into something that I just can't control away.  You can see me down and let's get out of my brain. 
[02:25:30]  There's a love that's bringing back the other way.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  Get the fuck out.  Now.  Why not?  What are you doing in my house?  Get the fuck out.  No.  Nothing's wrong.  Just stay in the living room.  I'll handle it.  Willis. 
[02:26:00]  There's a little break and there's too much sense  Willis  Steve can't take it, man  He's tapping out 
[02:26:30]  My blood's getting cold  He takes me into something that I just can't control  If you see the girl, I can let you out of my way  Well, can't you look at swinging back the other way?  Yeah!  Obligatory guitar!  I forgot about that  Yeah!  Buried in reverb  Wild stallions 
[02:27:00]  Yeah, bring it down  Every bad boy has a soft side  Ow!  That's terrible, I'm sorry  My blood's getting cold  No, no, no, no, no, no, no  You see me, girl 
[02:27:30]  And I can't get out of my way  Girl  Girl  Girl  Girl  No, no, no, no, no, no, no  You see me, girl  And I can't get out of my way  So grant the love is swinging back the other way  There you go, Foundry 
[02:28:00]  Pendulum  I'm the only station that really rocks  You know what, it's not that bad  You gotta be honest with the guy  It's not that bad  It's not  No, it's not that good either  No, it's alright  No, it's not that bad  Considering it was  We were hoping it was a lot worse, trust me  Let's see  Well, the instant feedback doesn't think so  Yeah, I'm sure they don't  I'm sure they're full with 
[02:28:30]  He's a savage animal  Oh, yeah  He sings monotone, too  Can you say, I only hear you sing something  Like what?  I sing jingles all the time  You've heard me sing before  Steve from Philly  Is the singer a great big person?  No problem  He sounds like the announcers  The news announcer from South Park  Hmm, okay  Sing a little something I can tell  I know you can  Like what?  Who's fronting the band?  Kim Jong-il  Kim Jong-il from Team America 
[02:29:00]  A lot of people thrown in the South Park reference  Steve once bit the head off an ostrich on stage  Is that true?  I got a question  I'm hungry enough  So you got a slow one?  Yeah, but  Power Ballad?  No, no Power Ballad  No  But you slowed it down?  I slowed it down  I slowed it down on one track that I wrote for my sister  But I don't want to play that one  You can't play that one  Oh, alright  The honey pot is swinging back the other way  What other one do you want to play there, Steve? 
[02:29:30]  Let me see  Let me see the thing  I'm telling you, I haven't heard this in years  Quite intentionally  He makes them play at parties  My mother plays this at her house  Because she's so proud  She's like, my son did this  And I'm like, mom, turn it off  She couldn't be proud  She probably does that when people are going to eat  And they shouldn't eat  She puts it on and it just wrecks their appetite  Oh, let's see  When you're all blocked up and you can't shit  They have this in the bathroom  She plays it when she wants to empty the house  Yeah, when she wants the company to leave  Yeah, the company needs to go home 
[02:30:00]  This is  Pick up some foundry  This is my son  Haven't heard anything like that since the song from Boogie Nights  Hello, exactly  What's the magic that's on that tape is ours?  You look like assholes, man  I'm Stephen Carr  The Opie and Anthony Show remembers  Friend and producer  Steve Carlisi  Well, that's it for us  And I'd like to thank you for checking out the Steve Carlisi tribute special  Looking back at the life and times of Steve Carlisi  Here on the Opie and Anthony Show 
[02:30:30]  Steve, as we've been saying, had recently passed away  And left behind a wife, a stepdaughter, and a two-year-old son  We couldn't be more upset about this  It was very unexpected  And really put his family in a hard position  I want to thank all of you who've been donating to the Steve Carlisi Fund  You can check it out at tinyurl.com  Slash Steve C Fund  Your donations mean the world to this family  Who are going through some rough times right now 
[02:31:00]  And we thank you here at the Opie and Anthony Show  For your  Look, we know that we say our listeners are a bunch of dicks and assholes  And just some of the most vile, evil people on the face of this earth  But there are times where you out there can show some humanity  And a softer side to your viciousness  And rally up and come through when the cause is needed  So we thank you for that  We've raised a lot of money  And we hope to continue doing so  So that about wraps this up here 
[02:31:30]  We miss Steve  We wish nothing but the best for his family  This is a really shitty situation that we're all in  It's very sad to lose somebody  We've lost a lot of people in the last two years  And not that they needed to be on the list  But Steve did not need to be on this list either  And so we'll end this with  This was  The lyrics to this song were on his  I guess you call it a prayer card  When you're at a wake in a funeral 
[02:32:00]  And they give you out those  They give out those little cards  With some kind of  Religious inspiration  To help you through a hard time  This card had the lyrics to this song on here  It's  Rascal Flatts  I'm moving on  It seemed fitting to end the show with this song  So  Here it is  Steve, we miss you  We love you  And  Rest in peace  I'm moving on 
[02:32:30]  At last I can see  Life has been patiently waiting for me  And I know  There's no guarantees  But I'm not  Alone  There comes a time  In everyone's life  When all you can see are the years passing by 
[02:33:00]  And I have made up my mind that those days are gone  I sold what I could  And packed what I couldn't  Stopped to fill up on my way out of town  I've loved like I should  But live like I shouldn't  I had to lose everything to find out 
[02:33:30]  Maybe forgiveness will find me somewhere down this road  I'm moving on  I'm moving on  I'm moving on  I'm moving on  And that's how you executive produce
