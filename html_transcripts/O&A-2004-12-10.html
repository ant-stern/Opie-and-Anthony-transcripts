<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with Iron Maiden's "Run to the Hills" and immediately transitioned into a promotional blitz for their XM Satellite Radio show (channel 202), offering a free trial and a "MyFys" giveaway.  An upcoming eggnog drinking contest was also advertised.  Anthony then launched into a furious rant about the previous night's Manhattan traffic, which significantly delayed a dinner meeting with Eric Logan ("Elo"), vowing never again to schedule a meeting during rush hour in the city. This sparked a discussion about the frustrations of navigating Manhattan traffic, featuring anecdotes about inconsiderate drivers and a disastrous dinner ruined by a loud jazz band.

The show continued with comedic bathroom and elevator encounters between Opie and Jim Norton, marked by Norton's escalating sexually suggestive comments directed at Opie.  Listener calls followed, including one about a woman's rapid weight gain, another proposing a "Guido Christmas" segment idea for the show, and several expressing appreciation for the show and sharing personal stories.  A discussion about a photo taken with Lindsay Lohan, followed by more Opie and Anthony banter about the photo's quality, ensued. The segment concluded with a promotion for comedian Brian Regan, who was scheduled to appear later.

Further discussions included Brian Regan's remarkable ability to create entirely new stand-up sets nightly, and cryptic plans involving "Super Agent Bob" (possibly Robert Eatman), hinting at a potential radio comeback.  A caller, Juliana, shared a graphic story about contracting pubic lice that spread to her eyelashes.  Another segment featured listener calls about NYC traffic experiences, leading to Opie recounting accidentally hitting a pedestrian and damaging his car's side-view mirror.  The show then played an interview with a Falun Gong practitioner conducted by their intern, Danny, which was notable for the intern's confusion and the practitioner's seemingly contradictory statements. The segment included additional listener calls, banter about funeral preferences, and a brief appearance by Brian Regan.  The show was peppered with vulgar language, off-color humor, and numerous XM Radio advertisements.

Comedian Brian Regan then joined Opie and Anthony as a guest.  The hosts greeted him with crude nicknames, sparking a discussion about the contrast between their radio style and that of older broadcasters like Paul Harvey.  Regan discussed his uncomfortable stay in New York, sleeping on a friend's fold-out couch and sharing humorous anecdotes about his friend's bathroom and his preference for hotels.  The conversation touched on donut-buying difficulties, the absurdity of fishing show credits, the challenges of older technologies, and a caller's request for Regan to use the "C-word," which he refused.  Other topics included the Scott Peterson trial, the awkwardness of mistaking pregnancy, a corporate gig with a pixelated presenter, a caller's childhood bike accident, and a bird getting stuck in a listener's house. Regan shared a story about killing a bat with a tennis racket.  A caller recounted a plane delay, prompting a fictional story from a pilot about finding a bag of money on a plane.  A malfunctioning computer was discussed, followed by a discussion of the hosts' recent firing and the resulting media attention. The show ended with a "F-word lesson,"  jabs at Jim Norton and his mother, and an XM Radio advertisement. Regan's upcoming shows at Caroline's were promoted throughout.


A subsequent segment began with a humorous anecdote about a colleague, Steve, and his obsession with flames.  This transitioned into a discussion about porn star Candy, who had recently been in the studio.  Explicit details of Candy's interactions with Opie, Anthony, and especially their intern Noah (who spent a weekend with her) were shared, including graphic details from text messages.  The conversation covered financial aspects of Candy's profession and Noah's access to her services.  Listener calls, an XM Radio advertisement, and promotion of the show (including a song called "Shit Dick" and a "Hi, Mom, I'm in Porno" bit) followed.  A news story about a naked man injured by a police K-9 prompted further humorous commentary. Candy's AIDS test results were teased as a cliffhanger.  The segment concluded with announcements of future show bits and more cliffhangers, along with an XM Radio advertisement.

The final segment started with a nonsensical potato bit and a discussion of a sound clip described as a horrifying castration story. This shifted to a listener's joke about Opie kicking a dog in the liver, leading into a drawn-out, dramatic, and unsettling story about Opie's dog, Chester, developing a limp and eventually dying.  The hosts teased details, hinting at foul play.  A poorly written and insensitive song about Lacey Peterson was played and mocked. Listener calls followed, and the show concluded with a listener's jokes, XM Radio promotions, and a bizarre announcement about a gay male group orgy competition on Gaperview. The hosts engaged in frequent interjections, shouting, and playful bickering throughout.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  The white man came across the sea  He brought us pain and misery  He killed our traps, he killed our creeds  He took our game for his own need  We fought him hard, we fought him well  Out on the plains, we gave him hell 
[00:00:30]  But when it came, so much for free  Oh, will we ever be set free?  Riding through ghost graves and violent wastes  Galloping hard on the plains  Chasing the redskins back to their holes  Fighting them at their own game  Murder for freedom, the stab in the back  Women and children, the cowards attack  Run to the hills 
[00:01:00]  Run for your lives  Run to the hills  Run for your lives  Soldier blue in the barren wastes  Dancing and killing the game  Raping the women and wasting the man 
[00:01:30]  The only good engines are tame  Selling the whiskey and taking their gold  And saving the young and destroying the old  Run to the hills  Run for your lives  Run to the hills  Run to the hills  Run for your lives  Run for your lives 
[00:02:00]  I'll be right back. 
[00:02:30]  I'll be right back. 
[00:03:00]  Run for your lies.  Run to the hills.  Run for your lies.  Run to the hills.  Run for your lies.

You ever get the Rusty Trombone?  Oh, that's not it either.  You know what I wanted to play?  Is the Rusty Trombone song.  Oh, the song.  That was the wrong thing.  No, that was my screw-up, actually.  Is it the Rusty Trombone?  Is best.  Yeah, do we have the Rusty Trombone song?  If we could find that.  We had a request for that, actually, and I thought I found it, and no, that was a guy 
[00:12:30]  actually explaining what the Rusty Trombone is, and then there were some songs that were  made about it.  Is that Airsick?  Airsick did that one?  There was a bunch of them.  I think they did.  There was a bunch of Rusty Trombone songs.  Yeah.  So, all right, I guess we should just get into the program.  Sorry, and I was going to play a little ditty that would have put a smile on your face.  Yeah, thanks.  After the show yesterday, we had dinner with Elo, well, later on in the day.  Elo.  I'm fast-forwarding right to dinner. 
[00:13:00]  Fast-forwarding to that.  Then we can talk about the other stuff that happened after the show.  I don't, yeah, I'm really not, there's really nothing that happened after the show.  Like, life is just pretty much the show, and then any meeting, and then sleep.  That's pretty much it.  So, we did the show.  I have no clue what happened after that until we had our meeting.  And for some reason, our meeting, our little dinner meeting with Elo, was scheduled for 6 o'clock. 
[00:13:30]  No, no, no, no, no.  It was originally scheduled for 7 o'clock.  Yes, 7 o'clock.  7 o'clock.  Which is the middle of the night for Anthony and I.  Pretty much.  For a normal person, I would say 7 o'clock is like 11.30.  Like 11.30 at night for us.  It's the end of the night.  It's time to start thinking about going to bed.  Right.  That's pretty much it.  But he wanted to have dinner at 7.  I'm like, Elo.  Elo.  He likes to be called Elo.  Eric Logan. 
[00:14:00]  Elo.  Elo.  So, yeah, he calls me at dinner at 7.  I'm like, are you insane?  We do mornings.  We can't handle that.  We need our beauty sleep.  So, I got him to change the meeting.  Wow, that shirt is really obnoxious.  No, it's great.  No, it's awful.  No, it's a fantastic shirt.  No, the colors are awful.  I picked this color because it's different.  Like, aqua blue and orange and brown.  Yeah, it's an odd shirt, but I decided to get another color than just the typical. 
[00:14:30]  I like the aqua blue.  Dude, my eyes are freaking out.  No, they're fine.  It's an aqua blue shirt.  Yeah, it's light.  With orange writing and an orange bubble.  It's got like a 70s vibe to it.  It certainly does.  That is probably the ugliest shirt I've ever seen.  Oh, it's a great shirt.  Are you kidding me?  I know it's prior and all, but that's just ugly.  Oh, it's fantastic.  What does the saying say?  No, you don't need to know.  Why?  It says, uh, Mudbone says keep some sunshine on your face.  So, there's a prior line.  No, I know it is.  That's an awful shirt, isn't it?  No, it's great.  Look, look how you need to talk. 
[00:15:00]  He's wearing lime green.  Hey, relax over there.  What?  I did.  That's why I was late.  No, Ben.  This isn't bad.  Listen, I don't have a lot of clean clothes.  This could be the show where we just, like, all beat each other up.  Why?  I'm in a great mood.  I finally slept.  Yeah, obviously.  Thanks for coming by and helping us get this mess together.  I know.  I call Ben.  He thinks I'm trying to get him.  It's like 544.  I'm like, dude, I hit my alarm and just, you know, got up.  But he's like, no, I'll see you in two minutes.  Well, that's crying wolf is what you do, Jimmy.  Okay. 
[00:15:30]  You call up Norton all the time and say, oh, I'm going to be late.  I'm not coming in until, like, 630.  And then Ben panics.  And then you walk right through the door and laugh.  And we all laugh.  Ben always calls.  I never call him.  He's messing around.  No?  Brad's calling from Canada.  What's up, Brad?  How are you guys doing this morning?  Good.  I just thought to check on Opie.  Make sure he had some breakfast this morning.  He got to sleep last night.  He's good for the day.  Well, I really appreciate that.  Yeah, I didn't sleep yesterday or for yesterday's show.  And I forgot all my food. 
[00:16:00]  So I don't even remember.  Deja vu yesterday, man.  It was hilarious.  I don't even remember being here yesterday.  Really?  Yeah.  Our old program director used to make me eat Jell-O before the show.  Remember that?  Because I have this blood sugar problem.  Yeah.  It's nothing serious.  But if I don't eat, my blood sugar level drops.  And then I get very, like, lightheaded and strange.  And I don't know.  I've been checked out.  So don't worry.  It's not, I mean, like the listeners would worry.  It's not diabetes or anything.  But it's just this thing. 
[00:16:30]  You have to eat.  I got to eat.  Anthony doesn't need to eat in the morning.  And he's fine.  No.  So, yeah, I ate.  And then, look, I got all my granola and boxes of cereal around here.  Pop-tarts.  I'm fine.  I'm fine.  Perhaps I should eat, though.  Huh?  I gained a little weight.  Jesus Christ.  And it's going to have a meltdown.  I'm just warning everybody.  I'm just warning everybody.  Why?  Is that in a bad mood?  Well, if you got...  I'm in a snotty, fucking shitty mood. 
[00:17:00]  If you got here at 5 o'clock, you would have heard what I heard.  I'm in a...  I'm trying to...  Between that fucking traffic last night...  I'm trying to cheer him up.  And ELO meeting...  Find the comedy.  During rush hour in Manhattan during the holidays.  Find the comedy.  What do you want to hear?  During the holidays.  I'll play anything you want today to make you laugh.  Oh.  It's very uncomfortable when Anthony has the meltdowns.  Yeah.  Because they're very rare.  Everyone expects me to have the meltdowns.  So when you hear me meltdowns, it's like, ah, it's Opie and O, whatever. 
[00:17:30]  But when Ant melts down, forget about it.  Because I never do.  People hide.  Because I never do.  People were hiding around here like cockroaches.  Very rare.  Like cockroaches in my apartment after the Polish maid left.  Very rare.  I get pissed.  All right.  Where are we going to start?  So ELO invites us to dinner.  Yes.  And we got us knocked down to a six o'clock dinner.  Yeah.  Knocked down.  Thanks.  From seven o'clock.  Seven o'clock.  And it's about 6.15 and I decided to call my old pal Anthony. 
[00:18:00]  Anthony.  Ring.  Ring.  Hey, Ant.  Where are you?  Does cell phone sound like that when you call it?  Like an old 50s style telephone?  Ring.  Ring.  Well, I can't do the Nokia or anything like that.  I'm not that great at impressions.  I can do basic impressions.  Yeah.  That's my phone ring impression.  Ring.  Ring.  I think it gets the point across.  All right.  So I call Anthony assuming that, I don't know, he's already checked in in the hotel because 
[00:18:30]  I guess you decided to stay in, right?  I decided if we're going to meet and it's like six o'clock, I didn't want to have to drive  back out to Long Island, so I got a room.  Yes.  Yes.  Got a room.  And my plan was to leave Long Island and check in, park the car, and go to the dinner with  Elo.  Sounds simple enough, right?  Sure.  Sure.  So I call Anthony at 6.15 because he's now late. 
[00:19:00]  I'm just assuming, maybe you want to take a shower, maybe, I don't know, maybe you want  Christmas shopping.  And so I'm like all happy, we're sitting at a really nice restaurant, Elo showing us  pictures of his newborn, and everyone's happy, and Norton's even in a good mood, he's sitting  there, and we're all just waiting, there's Anthony's empty seat, so I call you to see  where you're at, and man, did you give me an earful.  I, you know, I...  You had a lash out at someone, I guess, so you decided to lash out at your pal.  Motherfucker! 
[00:19:30]  Guys, you fucking get traffic!  That's pretty much what I'll be heard.  Never again.  Never again!  There was mother effers being thrown.  Oh, I know.  I thought you were cursing me out.  I'm like, I had nothing to do with this.  If it was up to me, I wouldn't have been at that dinner last night.  But I made it a point to tell Elo...  To his face.  Yes.  That I shan't, I shan't go to any more meetings during rush hour. 
[00:20:00]  If he wants us to have a meeting, it can be after the show.  We get done with the show, we'll go in the office, we'll have a little meeting, you want  to do lunch, something like that, that's fine.  But during the holidays, to drive in Manhattan at rush hour, you know what my drive takes  me?  I live in Great Man.  I think it's like 20 minutes, right?  Yeah.  No traffic, 20 minutes, door to door?  20 minutes from my garage door opening to me walking through the door to this studio. 
[00:20:30]  20 minutes.  I am 20 minutes away, so I figured I'd give myself an hour and 15 minutes to get here  on a Thursday late afternoon.  Extra hour for traffic.  Right.  An extra hour.  Which would be a drag, I think.  It would be, but hey, we've got a meeting with Elo.  Knowing that the ride takes 20 minutes and it's going to take you an hour and 20 minutes,  that's in your head already, you're like, this is a drag, I'm bummed out, right? 
[00:21:00]  Absolutely.  But, what the hell, it's dinner with Elo.  Got to suck it up.  Two hours.  It's a 20 minute drive.  It's 20 minutes away.  It's pretty much not even 20 miles away.  Yeah.  It's 20 minutes because you've got to do some tunnel crap or a bridge or something.  Midtown tunnel.  Then you've got to slow it down.  When you do get into Manhattan, it's probably only 15 miles away. 
[00:21:30]  Yeah.  Right?  Yeah.  Two hours to go 15 miles.  Two hours.  And it's not even just the time that it takes.  It's the crap you have to deal with once you go through that tunnel.  It's the crap that the cabs, the buses.  Things would move so smoothly if these asshole cabs and buses wouldn't stop right in the middle of the grid.  Right in the middle of the intersection. 
[00:22:00]  Now the light turns green for you.  You aren't going anywhere.  There's a bus.  There's a bus in your way.  There's a line of cabs in your way.  Because they had to go across and stop in the middle of the intersection.  Although you can see the line of traffic isn't going to move by the time the light turns red.  And let's fuck up everybody's drive going the other way.  Now we're just going to stop and block traffic.  And this happens every block.  Every single block.  And those mutant excuses for traffic control. 
[00:22:30]  Those wannabe cops that stand out there.  They don't stand on the double yellow line down 57th.  And wave traffic on.  They'll stand in your lane.  And then wave you on.  Now the whole line of traffic has to go around that fat lump of shit that's direct in traffic.  And slow down because you don't want to clock her with your mirror.  Or bang into the cab that's next to you.  So that slows the whole process down. 
[00:23:00]  Pedestrians.  Christmas shopping.  The lovely spirit of Christmas in New York.  Isn't it beautiful?  No it's not.  It gets in the way.  Could you shop online?  We're trying to work here.  So I've had it.  I will never again come into Manhattan during rush hour for a meeting.  You want to meet with us?  We'll do it here after the show.  I have to be out of here by 2 o'clock.  That's it.  Here in Washington?  You're describing this much calmer than last night. 
[00:23:30]  Well I'm trying.  You got right in Nilo's face.  Listen motherfucker.  You were out of your mind.  I was a little pissed.  He gets to the restaurant and you look like a crazy person.  I was pissed.  Never again!  I'm like, dude, shut up again.  Oh I know.  Relax.  It was like I was commenting on the Holocaust.  Never again.  And then we're eating food and then the band decides to start playing and they gave us  a table right next to the jazz band.  Anthony looked at the rolls like he was going to start belting the freaking trombone player.  And then I wanted to pick up silverware and just start flinging it at that lousy jazz band. 
[00:24:00]  Nothing worse than trying to eat and just hearing, you know,  Hey!  Bad drums going.  Three guys playing three different songs and saying it's jazz.  This is horrible.  Loud.  Some of these restaurants, they think they're doing you a favor when all of a sudden there's  live music or a jazz band.  Yeah. 
[00:24:30]  You know, the problem is you've been sitting there for an hour and the volume is perfect.  You're having a nice meal, nice conversation.  Then all of a sudden the band cranks up and it's way too loud.  You're trying to talk.  And you're just like, I don't want to hear this.  Why are they doing this?  You're trying to, you're having a conversation with people at your table.  Now you've got to yell.  Right.  Isn't your voice a little hoarse today?  We're at a table two feet from each other.  Yeah, well, that's a good idea. 
[00:25:00]  We like that.  Yeah, that's a good one, Jimmy.  You did say something, didn't you?  And then Anthony and I, it's like 8.30.  We're out of here.  I'm leaving.  And I whisper to Jim, Jim, it's a good opportunity to get some time in with the boss.  We'll see you later.  We just dart for the door.  I had your little private conversation go.  15 minutes, we just chatted.  So, yeah, I knew it wasn't going to be late.  And he had to go and I had to go.  But I just was going to go to Soda. 
[00:25:30]  Wonderful.  Did you have fun last night?  Yeah, it was actually a nice dinner.  And, you know, we didn't really talk about anything after it.  Just bullshit.  Yeah.  Jimmy got me in the bathroom.  I had to take a leak.  I thought I was, I got away unscathed.  So, you know, just taking a leak, talking about the show.  And then somebody walks in the bathroom.  A guy walks in the bathroom.  And Jimmy just switches gears in a second.  He's just talking about the show, you know.  Hey, that was, you know, fun yesterday.  And then in a second, he hears the door open and someone walks in. 
[00:26:00]  And he just starts with, you know, how sexy you look.  And, you know, when I was sucking it, I...  He did not say that.  What were you...  I said something about, and it's like, I mean, like, it was like along the lines of, like,  you know, and I know that you and I have been having problems and stuff like that.  But, you know, I don't care if you want to see other people.  I mean, I'm comfortable sleeping with you as well as other people.  Yeah, he starts carrying on these conversations.  There's always a guy in a business suit.  It's the most awesome guy in a business suit.  Of course it was.  It always is. 
[00:26:30]  Leaving here yesterday.  I'm not...  I'm done with you and elevators.  Why?  I am going to start walking down five flights of stairs.  I've had it with you.  Because the elevator opens now.  Yesterday, it was just Jimmy and I.  Where were you?  I didn't get in.  Oh, you decided not to get in.  When that elevator door opened.  That's right.  We were all out there waiting for the elevator.  And it's like, no way.  I can't handle this anymore.  So you blew off the elevator.  So I go in with Jim.  There was no one in there at that point, right?  No, it was empty.  There was no one in there at that point.  So I'm thinking, I am home free. 
[00:27:00]  We're going to get down to the lobby.  And I'm out.  And I can be home in minutes.  No problem, right?  Yeah.  Because it's really uncomfortable when he plays these gags in the elevator.  Totally.  So did you know the elevator was going up?  No, no, no.  I didn't.  I wouldn't have known it.  So we get in the elevator.  We're on the fifth floor.  And I forget to push L for lobby.  And so does Jim.  So all of a sudden, it's going to be a quick ride down the lobby, right?  Right.  All of a sudden, I saw that the elevator was going up. 
[00:27:30]  And I'm just like sweating.  I'm like, oh, my God.  It's going all the way up to the 16th floor, which means now it has to come all the way  back down to the lobby.  Guaranteed, people are going to be coming in.  Of course.  And if it's going up to 16, it's picking up some people, obviously, right?  So my heart's pounding.  Boom, boom.  Boom, boom.  I'm like, no, I'm stuck.  Totally.  Stuck with Jim Norton in an elevator.  So these two people get on the elevator.  And what did you say to me?  Well, in the same way as what I said to you.  No, you said, you know, you were like, you were a violent gay guy. 
[00:28:00]  You were like, you know, what do you expect?  I mean, you dress so sexy.  When you dress so sexy like that, what do you expect me to do?  Oh, no.  It's like, yeah, dude, you know the way I am.  If you're going to come over and you don't want to be touched, it's fine.  But just don't sit next to me.  I told you that when you came over.  I'm not trying to bother you.  It's like, you understand.  I understand.  But you still come over.  It's a quiet elevator full of people, and they're listening to this conversation.  But we're not looking at each other.  I'm facing the door, and he's standing behind me.  So it's like I'm just talking, and it's like they know I'm talking to him.  I don't know about that, because my strategy was to completely ignore you. 
[00:28:30]  But you got on the elevator together.  Well, we were in the elevator when the other people came in.  So my strategy was that maybe they'll look at this guy, because, you know, with your  puffy coat and your Terminator glasses and your shaved head, you look a little freaky.  So I'm thinking maybe these people will think he's just a lunatic talking to himself.  That was my strategy yesterday.  Thank you for pointing that out.  Next time I will make absolutely sure not to make that joke there.  No, you don't understand.  See, I have friends help.  No, you don't understand.  I'm not taking the elevator with you anymore.  You'll have to eventually.  No, I won't. 
[00:29:00]  I'm done.  I'll suggest we have a 40th floor somewhere.  I'm done.  It's a rusted roulette.  We went up to 16, down to 15, down to 8, down back to 5, down to 4, and finally to  the lobby.  And the whole time he's saying how, you know, I deserve it because I was dressing sexy,  and if I didn't want to be touched, then why did I come over looking like that?  Oh, God.  It's so embarrassing.  And it's like Russian roulette when you walk in an empty elevator with him.  And I'm looking at the numbers going, oh, please don't stop. 
[00:29:30]  Just hit the lobby.  And then it stops on 2 or something, and you just know it's coming.  It's funny every time to embarrass you.  This is the rule of being a man.  When you can embarrass your friends with gay stuff, it's funny every time.  It really is funny.  It's only funny to you, though.  Oh, no.  It's funny to you afterwards.  Not in the moment.  It's very embarrassing.  In the moment, it's horrific.  It really is horrific in the moment.  And then you try to explain to the guys, like, look, don't listen to what this guy  says, you know, I've tried that tack.  That doesn't work.  It doesn't work because people are just like, yeah, whatever. 
[00:30:00]  You two work it out between yourselves.  Exactly.  Hey, man, don't be shy.  Don't be shy.  Don't be shy.  My shirt itches, by the way.  I hate it.  I just bought this shirt.  Dude, it's an awful shirt.  No, it's a great shirt.  No, it's awful.  You're trying to convince yourself it's a nice shirt.  No, I love it.  That's why I bought it.  That new shirt, and I just have a little sensitive baby ass skin around my whole fat body.  Baby ass skin.  That's how my whole body feels like a fat little baby ass.  That shirt's going to annoy me all day.  Oh, well, you'll learn to love it.  No, it's going to annoy me all day.  You look well on you.  Learn to love it, Opie.  Learn to love it. 
[00:30:30]  Dan in California.  What's up, Dan?  Oh, not a whole lot.  I just wanted to tell you that you guys got another free play convert.  Oh, thank you.  Thanks, man.  You're going to pay the two bucks to listen to us.  We appreciate that.  No, you're far worth it.  Howard Stern sucks compared to you guys.  But, dude, don't forget you have the rest of this month free, so keep that dollar something  to yourself until January 1st.  Don't write that check until January 1st.  Wow.  That's just an amazing, amazing savings.  You know what sold me?  Huh?  Being a lover of, well, the new term I learned from you guys, wood floor, that what's in 
[00:31:00]  my pants is what sold me.  Really?  Nice.  That's all it took, huh?  That cracked me up.  I was laughing so hard.  That is a fun game.  There you go.  You could listen to that or listen to Howard bitch about everyone's out to get him.  You know, that's your decision to decide.  Yeah, and that girl gained what?  37 pounds in seven minutes?  Yeah, that was hilarious.  She started out at 112 pounds and she ended up at 149 by the end of the bit.  You guys had me rolling.  Oh, thank you, Dan.  Thanks, bro. 
[00:31:30]  So, spread the virus for us.  Tell your fellow, I don't know, tell your friends whatever about us, all right?  Absolutely.  That's how this show is going to grow.  Word of mouth.  There goes Dan.  Let's say hi to Ghost.  He's a trucker.  Ghost, what's up?  Hey, I got a perfect one for the 12th day of Guido Christmas.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's 12 shots of Dan's clam sauce.  He thinks it's great, though.  No, he doesn't.  That's called awkward silence filler. 
[00:32:00]  I've had it, bro.  It happened.  All right, Jay in Oregon.  What's up, Jay?  What's up, boys?  Hey.  How's it going?  Good.  Hey.  Jimmy, good morning.  How are you?  Good morning.  I'm a little itchy, but feeling good otherwise.  Thanks.  Jay, I wish you could see his awful T-shirt.  It's not a bad shirt.  No.  Richard Pryor is one of the coolest men to ever live.  The greatest.  That shirt stinks.  RichardPryor.com.  That shirt stinks.  I love this shirt.  No.  I went with a different color because I always go with black or whatever.  I wanted just like a different weird color.  I never wore bright colors.  You went black with that shirt?  Well, yeah, with a face on it, yeah. 
[00:32:30]  But I mean, you know what I'm saying.  It's just a different color.  Although the picture looks like Muammar Gaddafi.  Yeah, it's a weird.  It's like a weird.  You kind of look like a predator.  No, sweetie.  You look like a predator in that shirt.  Something's not right, right, Ant?  Because I'm such a little creep, and I have breasts, and there's a black man on my shirt.  And you think that's an odd look for me?  Well, that's just a little weird coloring.  Very weird.  I realize that.  They don't go together.  No, no, they don't.  That's the beauty of it.  That's why I like it.  They had lime green, which they were out of.  I tried to get lime green.  Oh.  Kind of like Ben is wearing today.  That would have matched your hepatitis. 
[00:33:00]  Jay, what's up?  I don't have hepatitis, Opie.  Opie.  I'm having fucking nightmares from that Paisano song you guys played yesterday.  Not to mention, I've been driving for the last 13 hours, and I've heard it three fucking times.  Oh, yeah.  The replays will get to the truckers.  I forgot about that.  Yeah, you know, you can't.  We do allow you to switch off the replays if you've heard them a few times, and maybe check out some of the other programming on XM.  Sure.  Yeah, but then you miss the stuff like, you know, when you've got to fill up the tank with gas, you've got to listen to it three hours and 55 minutes later, so you can hear what you missed the five fucking minutes. 
[00:33:30]  Hey, that's a faithful listener.  I like that.  Well, thank you, Jay.  You guys rock.  We've been listening to a long time.  AEW, you guys kick fucking ass.  Keep it going, boys.  Thank you.  Cool.  Very cool.  And you have to check in somewhere.  Don't forget to watch all tree godfathers.  You guys want to hear that again?  No, don't even joke.  Donald, what's going on?  Two hours of traffic.  One bad picture taken.  One meeting with Elo. 
[00:34:00]  Oh, five homosexual references.  I couldn't think of anything.  Donald, what's going on?  Hey, I'm having my first beer of the morning.  All right.  And yesterday was the first time I ever heard you guys.  I heard Jim Norton.  And I was just making sure he was still going to be on there every day if I pay for that show.  Oh, yeah.  Sir, I will guarantee you $2 worth of Jim Norton every month.  Yeah, I'm here.  I'm very rarely not here.  And I just want to let you know it wasn't our choice, Donald.  We're stuck with him.  We thought it was a good idea at the time, but now, I don't know. 
[00:34:30]  I have compromising photos.  I have compromising photos.  Compromising photos?  You wanted to get the photos so quick.  Yeah, I know.  I just started tripping over it like a little clumsy baby-skinned zilch.  I hate that.  I'm eager to get the line out.  Compromising.  So, Donald, are you going to sign up or what?  Oh, yeah, but I got a question for Jim.  Not going to work, Donald.  What?  Okay, you want to ask me a question?  Yeah.  You okay?  What would your question be? 
[00:35:00]  I understand you're itching.  Are you sure crabs don't, like, crawl up when you're sleeping?  Dude, I've had crabs twice.  I possibly, I think I, no, I actually had crabs three times in my life.  How are you not sure?  Well, no, twice from the same girl in a week.  And then once from an ex-girlfriend who cheated on me when I was, like, 21.  This black chick gave me crabs twice in a week.  I've never had crabs.  Oh, don't be so silly.  I swear to God.  I banged her, I get crabs, a week later I went back for more, I knew she had them.  You knew she had crabs, yet you went back. 
[00:35:30]  Yeah.  How old were you?  18?  19?  That's at that age where it's just like, me, I didn't get them from her.  I don't care.  Hey, they went away.  I could fix them.  They were terrible.  Were they?  Dude, when you pick one off and those little legs are waving at you, I picked a little black  pepper spot out of my pubis, and I could feel it.  And then the next time I had sex with her, like, you pull it out of your skin, and you  can almost feel the little, like, where its little legs are holding on.  It doesn't hurt.  But then the next time I had them, I just knew, like, after I saw her, I felt something, 
[00:36:00]  and it was, like, one of them crawling in my lower pubes.  I went and I already had the rib medication.  Oh, that is frightening.  What do they, why do they congregate down there?  Warmth.  Is it?  Yes, it's a warm area of your body, and I guess that the, uh, I'm not a hairy guy.  I know a lot about crabs.  Well, it's, you know, so, yeah, it's pretty.  You're not a hairy guy.  That's an understick.  That's what I'm saying.  I have wispy hairs.  Oh, you have no hair.  Wispy hairs down there?  Dude, he has no hair on his entire body.  Yeah, look at this.  Look at this itchy little arm.  Look at that smooth, nice to the touch. 
[00:36:30]  That's true.  But, um, yeah, they congregate between your legs because it's nice and warm.  Oh, just crawling around on your junk.  Burrowing into it.  Burrowing.  Did you confront her with the hay?  Yeah, she's like, no, I don't.  I'm like, all right, what is she going to say?  And then my ex-girlfriend, uh, years ago, she shaved all her, she always kept, like,  a little, uh, I guess, like, you know, a trim.  But then one time she totally shaved that wood floor.  And I'm like, eh, I didn't notice.  I was like, oh, this is fantastic.  But then I wound up getting crabs. 
[00:37:00]  And I'm like, that bitch knew she had them and probably shaved her pubic hair.  Yeah.  And thinking it would go away.  How do you, uh, yeah, how do you have them if you shave?  Can't you just wash them away?  It might have been in her sheets by then.  It might have been in her hair on her.  I mean, who knows?  Oh, oh.  But you have to wash your sheets with RID medication, which I did.  You're, like, dumped.  I mean, I'm paranoid about that.  RID, huh?  But there was nothing you could do about it.  Yeah, I mean, I didn't do anything wrong.  I just caught them.  Crabs you can get anywhere.  I mean, you can get them from a bed.  Well, I never did.  Yeah. 
[00:37:30]  Or a toilet seat.  Yeah, a bed of somebody that you don't know where they've been.  Yeah, well, yeah.  Or if you're in a hotel.  Sometimes in a motel you can.  Stop.  Oh, yeah, you can.  Absolutely.  You can get leiser crabs from a motel.  Of course you can.  Imagine you're a guy away on a business trip, and that happens to you.  You go home and give your wife crabs or something.  The best one you can give her.  You can't catch hepatitis or herpes from a bed.  Yeah, but you've got to explain now, oh, it came from the hotel bed?  Yeah.  That would never work.  Probably not.  You would never, ever believe it.  Probably not, but it actually is true. 
[00:38:00]  And you can tell her to go look it up online.  You know what I mean?  Look it up online.  Look it up online.  Look it up online, please.  I didn't cheat on you.  Look it up online.  Yeah, that's kind of weak.  It's got to be true.  Just ask my friend.  That's where all the other assholes go to post that they got it from a hotel bed.  All right, look.  I'll compromise.  Nice compromise.  Well, yes, it's true, ladies and gentlemen.  We all met Lindsay Lohan yesterday after the show.  Oh, yes.  Yep.  It's no fib.  Anthony's favorite, right, these days? 
[00:38:30]  Yeah, as a matter of fact, watching our video.  I do believe, Anthony, you were a little smitten yesterday after the show.  I don't think I was smitten.  You were kind of happy in a weird way yesterday.  I thought it was kind of cool.  That's what I mean.  You usually don't really care.  Never cares.  See her alive.  Anthony doesn't really care when celebrities are around whatsoever, for the most part.  Waiting out there, he's like, I want to get a picture.  It's never like that.  He just played a little less.  But everybody was.  Jim, you were the guy with the camera out.  No, no, that's what I'm saying.  Dude, I'm the worst.  But you're the guy that usually will just leave. 
[00:39:00]  You don't care.  But that's what I'm saying.  You waited around.  Yes, I did.  Which was very interesting because you rarely do that.  You can't be bothered.  That's true.  But you're just waiting in the wings, kind of like, just kind of blending in with everyone,  taking your little peeks as she's in her office with some little kid.  And she was sitting in our office on our couch, and everybody's trying to figure out who's  going to get to smell the couch when she got up and left.  It's like, who's going to run in there and give it a little sniff?  She had two massive bodyguards with her. 
[00:39:30]  Oh, my God.  That big black guy looked like Marsalis Wallace.  Oh, yeah.  And then it had another one, a smaller guy, but it looked twice as threatening.  He was obviously packing some heat.  There was a big SUV outside.  The paparazzi were outside.  Matter of fact, the picture of her leaving the building is in one of the papers today,  one of the New York papers, Daily News of the Post, because her father's in trouble again.  Yeah.  He's in rehab and there's some kind of restraining order. 
[00:40:00]  He can't go near his daughter there.  He can't go near little Lindsay.  How old is she?  She's 18 now.  That's it?  Yeah.  That girl, she looks older than 18.  Yeah.  I know they make her up with the makeup and the good hair and all that, but.  Yeah, she was dressed very casual yesterday.  Had her hair in like a ponytail or something.  I thought you guys were going to get turned down, by the way.  I was watching the whole thing go down.  Who'd she think she is, De Niro?  I thought she wasn't going to take pictures with everybody.  Why, are you kidding me?  I'm serious.  She's using our office. 
[00:40:30]  Yeah.  We weren't even allowed in our office.  Do you know how awful that would have been this morning on the air if we got turned  down in our own office for a photo?  In our own office.  She was sitting in the office and then her video came on on the big screen that we have.  Yeah.  Like watching her all hoary, dancing around and stuff.  And there she was, sitting right there on the couch.  It's so funny because you guys got to see this place, but we have a huge glass office  across the way.  You can see right in there and then there's all these cubicles and stuff.  And every guy, there had to be at least a dozen or 15 guys all just kind of taking peeks 
[00:41:00]  at her, but making believe they're not looking.  Yeah.  But it was so obvious.  You know, because everyone's trying to be casual about it.  Like, oh, Lindsay's over there, but we got work to do.  You're looking.  And then who pounced first?  You did, Jim?  Of course I did.  Jimmy just slowly moving over with his camera out and his little fingers.  It's like, what did you say?  Can I take a picture with you?  It's almost like their reps, usually reps are going to say no. 
[00:41:30]  Oh, they're going to be bothered.  But it's hard if you look somebody in the eye and you're fairly pleasant.  You might have a photo and you're in the office.  What are they going to say?  Did you touch her arm and go, Lindsay?  Bob?  Bob?  Bob?  Mr. De Niro?  Mr. De Niro would have had more dignity.  But my forced familiarity and my baby body really disgusted him.  I can't believe I got turned down by De Niro.  Dude, that's going to bother me for a year.  Oh, of course it will.  But you didn't get turned down yesterday.  That was nice.  I'll trade you 50 Lindsay Lohans and 20 Wynton Marsalases, which I've gotten here. 
[00:42:00]  But Wynton Marsalases, who's the, is he the guy that's the, yeah, Marsalas Wallace  is from Pulpridge, all right?  Yeah.  I thought, uh...  Wynton Marsalas Wallace, yeah.  Okay, I missed it.  Are you all right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I just messed up.  I thought I was saying the wrong name and I was going to get destroyed.  But I was right, actually.  Yeah.  It gets you a little scared, doesn't it?  That's how nerve-wracking it is in this room.  I know.  Is that his name?  I know.  Well, you started that. 
[00:42:30]  It hits you like Pesci when he got it in the head when you screw up.  Oh, no.  You just don't see it coming.  It's like, what did I do?  Oh, no.  I'm trying to say a name and all of a sudden I'm in a room with some tables stacked in the  corner.  So, yeah, everyone got their pictures with Lindsay yesterday.  Yeah.  Everyone got to feel her boobies.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  She got those very...  That's what everyone was saying after they got the picture taken.  Did you get to feel the boobie?  And her shirt was kind of unbuttoned a little at the top, so you could kind of get a view 
[00:43:00]  of the top, mid-range of her breast.  I chose not to get a picture with her.  I don't know why.  I know.  Why?  She smelled good, too.  No, because Opie was smart.  After a day of toiling here and waking up on three hours sleep, he decided perhaps  a picture wasn't a good idea.  Ah, yeah.  Oh.  We look like hell.  We really do.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, I decided yesterday, because it's radio, right?  So, I show up.  Let it out, Ant.  Let it out.  I hadn't shaved.  We got a radio show to do. 
[00:43:30]  Let it out.  Hadn't shaved.  Here it comes, people.  For three days.  Here it comes.  And exhausted, tired.  So, I figure, I get a picture with Lindsay Lohan.  Screw it.  Keep it for my little photo album at home.  And I tell our own Eric.  I go, hey, send me the Lindsay Lohan picture.  Where are we going to put this photo?  Maybe on the mantle?  No, it was, you know, you print it out.  Kind of hang on to leave it in the computer.  I don't know.  It's just one to have.  Sure.  That's all. 
[00:44:00]  It's one to have.  So, maybe years from now, as you're looking through things, you go, oh, yeah, I remember  that.  I thought of attacking her.  Yeah, sure.  I thought of reaching my hand in that unbuttoned blouse.  Yeah, one of those.  What the hell?  So, I, it was taken on Eric's camera.  So, I tell him, hey, could you send me that picture?  Okay.  So, I get home.  I check my email.  It's not there.  So, I'm like, Eric, could you send me the picture?  I didn't get a reply. 
[00:44:30]  I didn't get anything.  Nothing.  Come in today, and start reading the instant feedback and whatnot, and, uh-oh, what am  I reading?  Hey, Anthony, how's the chemo going?  Anthony looking like, with his hat looking like Tom Hanks in Philadelphia.  You know, getting all that fun stuff that you have to go through.  Don't laugh.  With a bad picture.  You weren't here.  Don't laugh.  No, no.  You know something?  It's fine.  I'm not even looking at it.  Oh.  Oh.  You know something?  You already yelled at me once in the last 12 hours. 
[00:45:00]  I'm not getting yelled at again.  It's fine, because what the hell?  You take a lousy picture.  You've got to take the heat for it.  Sure.  If, if, if you decided that that was a good picture to put up on a site, then you take  the heat.  What the problem is, is I had told Eric, perhaps, you know, getting up this early and stuff and  doing stuff, me and Opie, at times, people take pictures, and we want to look at them  and go, no, you know, that's really a lousy picture. 
[00:45:30]  One eye is shut.  I'm half asleep.  Maybe I have some banana or bagel coming out of the side of my mouth or something.  Perhaps that isn't a good picture.  Well, you know, you touch on something.  It's a weird position to be in.  We're in the, we're in the public eye, obviously.  And it's so funny, because you have to be on all the time.  I remember one time, I literally had the flu.  Uh-huh.  Looked like shit.  Yeah.  Didn't shave, bags under my eyes, dark circles, and, you know, a fan comes up to me at the 
[00:46:00]  supermarket, and I'm in a bad mood, because I'm, I'm, I'm feeling, like, just awful.  I'm just trying to get some food.  I forgot what I was trying to get, but I needed some, so I was desperate, so I left my apartment,  right?  Yeah.  Next thing you know, it's on a message board.  I met Open, he's an asshole, and this and that, you know?  Yeah.  Because I was sick that day.  Right.  So you can't, you can't win.  You have to always be on, even if you're not feeling well.  Exactly.  And, you know, it's happened in the past, but, you know, it's, it's part of the deal of having 
[00:46:30]  this gig, and the newspapers will take pictures, and, you know, they'll always use the one,  you know, they'll have 10 pictures.  You could, you could see it every day in the Post.  You know, if the Post turns a picture of Hillary Clinton, you know, it's going to be the one  that makes her, you know, look like she's opening her eyes, like she's got a thyroid  problem, and, and, you know, her mouth is open.  Yeah, it's just what they do in the media.  It's what they do, but it, that's part of it.  You figure, you know, it's the press, and, and they love doing stuff like that, so you,  you know, you suck it up, and, and that's what you do. 
[00:47:00]  But your own people.  So there's Eric.  I, I had emailed him that I wanted to see the picture, and, uh, I got nothing in my  email.  No picture.  No?  No.  But, he did, uh, get it off his camera, and he sent it over to Foundry and put it up without  us checking on it or anything, or taking a look at it, and, you know, so I got to pay  the consequences.  Oh, well.  Thanks, Eric.  Good job.  I actually took a nice photo with Lindsay Lohan.  Did you?  Yeah, it looked very handsome in my picture.  I didn't see it.  Yeah, it's very handsome.  I'm going to have to look at it. 
[00:47:30]  You look like a psychopath.  You know, like you're doing all your celebrity photos.  Yes.  Oh, okay.  I got to look at Jimmy's.  Hey, someone wants to know about crabs.  They might have it.  Or have them, I should say.  Robbie in D.C., what's up?  Hey, I got a question for Jim about his crabs.  All right.  Uh, do those things itch, or do they see?  No, you can hear them.  That's how you know you have them.  Stop it.  Of course they itch.  Oh, I thought you were serious.  No, they're yelling up.  You can hear them.  Can you imagine?  You can hear them just munching away on your head.  They're little claws snapping together. 
[00:48:00]  Yeah, yeah.  You hear them whispering in your pubic hair.  Making construction plans.  And the other thing is, for Ant, man, you live in New York City.  You've got to expect there's going to be buses and crap up there when you live up there.  Oh, I know.  I'm punching out.  I know that there's going to be buses and stuff, but it just annoys me when they stop in the middle of the grid and you can't go.  And, you know, I'm fine if they want to, you know, block the intersection, but I choose not to drive in it anymore. 
[00:48:30]  I won't go to any more meetings.  You should have done what Michael Douglas did in falling down.  Just park the car and just start walking.  You know how many times you just want to get out of the car?  You do.  You're driving.  You're stopped in traffic that you just know isn't moving.  You just want to get out of that vehicle and just start walking.  Screw the world.  We interrupt this program to bring you the Ozone Midget Sighting of the Day.  Who saw this coming? 
[00:49:00]  Stephen Basher, what's up?  Hey, how you doing?  Pretty good, man.  Hey, what's up there, puppy balls?  Hi, fella.  Hey, what's up?  Yeah, I'm driving down my street yesterday on the way home.  I see this midget walking on the left side of the road, smoking a cigarette and his little stubby baby toe fingers.  Baby toe fingers.  And he's wearing a fucking kid's New York Giants jacket.  He's wearing a New York Giants jacket?  I mean, the guy was like under four feet tall.  Oh, Giants.  That's funny. 
[00:49:30]  That is funny.  That's what happened.  That's what I got.  Have a great one, guys.  All right.  Meanwhile, back at the show.  You know, this picture of Norton and Lindsay Lohan.  You look awful, Norton, with your double chin.  Norton looks great.  You've got to stick that chin out a little bit.  I look good if I have a niece named Morticia.  You've got to trick the camera.  I'm a fat pig.  And I was kidding when I said I look good.  I always look bad.  And that's the beauty of me.  I always look awful in pictures.  And you know what?  I don't care.  She doesn't look that good either.  She looks fine. 
[00:50:00]  Nah, she doesn't look that good.  We've seen much better pictures than her.  I think my awfulness is reflecting on her.  I don't think this environment is conducive to photo ops, to tell you the truth.  I got vibes off her, too.  Nasty, friggin' fluorescent lighting.  I can't wait until they just blow everyone out of this place, and we can set it up like  a club.  That's right.  That's coming soon, right?  Call it Club Ben.  Club Herky.  When you walk in, you have to check your bulge at the door.  You've got to order a Herky Jerky at the bar. 
[00:50:30]  One of Ben's custom drinks.  It's an alcoholic beverage in a baby cup, so this way if you move around, you won't spill  it.  In a sippy cup that the kids use.  And, of course, it's shaken, not stirred.  Oh, Ben is a mess.  The Herky Jerky.  I love a Herky Jerky.  I'm surprised no one has come up with the song, Do the Herky Jerky.  Oh.  Like the Hucklebuck?  Yeah, I mean, that's an obvious one.  You put your big mule in, you take your big mule out. 
[00:51:00]  You put your big mule in, and you herky all about.  Do the Herky Jerky, then you turn yourself around.  Nice.  You do the Herky Jerky, then you throw your comb out.  Oh, Ben, he comes in here not knowing that he's just in the bathroom.  Just that you walked in, and your hair was blowing like it was an 80s heavy metal video.  Good, I just left the bathroom window open.  Oh, what are you doing? 
[00:51:30]  Bastard.  Of course.  Hey, you know what?  Freezing outside, it looks like a day out of the movie Seven.  The funniest part to me yesterday was the meeting with one of the bosses, and Jim and Steve's  knowledge about porn awards and all that stuff.  I forgot about our pre-dinner meeting we had yesterday, too.  Just meeting after meeting after meeting.  It's what they do at XM.  They love their meetings.  They love their meetings.  Logan was a good meeting, though, because the food was good, and everybody was eating.  You know what?  It's true.  Logan is brilliant.  Yeah, he's good.  You get that vibe of what?  The guy knows what he's doing, and he's going to turn this whole satellite radio thing around. 
[00:52:00]  I'm telling you.  Turn it around.  He's only been there three months, so he's just trying to get his arms around the whole  thing and figure it out.  But, you know, I think XM's going to get a lot better in 05.  A lot better.  I got weird vibes, though.  Like, we were sitting there having a drink, and he was just kind of talking to me.  I'm like, I think he wants to, uh, maybe, uh, you know, see if Jim Norton needs a little  raise.  A little massage.  Really?  No.  You were getting that vibe from him? 
[00:52:30]  Oh, he's going to...  He's married with a child.  He's a nice guy, and you can see he's really ready to axe somebody.  I love him.  Oh, yeah.  You can tell.  Oh, he's ruthless.  Yeah, that...  He pretty much had the axe with him.  Yeah, he's got a boyish face, and you wouldn't know it.  Like, he looks like a pushover.  Like, yeah, he's a boyish...  Oh, but you talk to him.  That fucker's going to axe somebody good.  Good hatchet to the back of the neck.  Good.  He's one of those people who've been in radio for a while, you know.  Just knows the ins and outs.  I like that.  Because he looks young.  He looks young, and you want to kind of kiss his cheek and go, ah, good luck.  Give him a tussle. 
[00:53:00]  Tussle his hair a little bit.  Yeah, good luck, fella.  But, um, I like him.  As we go to break, Anthony.  Yes.  We have Brian Regan coming in.  In what, like 20 minutes?  Yeah, 7.15.  7.15.  Brian Regan on the Opie and Anthony Show.  First time live since he did our last show.  Brian was our last guest we ever had at N.E.W.  It was the day after the Sex for Sam debacle.  When...  We were actually allowed back on the air that day.  Yep.  They told us not to talk about Sex for Sam. 
[00:53:30]  Yep.  Uh, so we had Brian Regan on, and we were trying to talk about Sex for Sam without talking  about it.  It was very uncomfortable.  And, uh, he was our final guest.  He's a true friend of the show.  He's playing Caroline's all this weekend.  We love him.  I'm sure that all the shows are sold out.  I don't know.  We'll find out when it gets here.  Yeah, he sells out.  He sells out, like, weeks in advance.  The guy is literally the top five funniest guys out there.  Yep.  Easily.  And I'm talking about Seinfeld and everybody.  I mean, Brian Regan, I laugh so hard at his shows. 
[00:54:00]  You wake up the next day, and you're like, what's wrong with my ribs?  You think someone punched you, and you forgot.  It's that type of laugh, where you beg him to stop, because it hurts so much.  I know.  Great.  He's unbelievable.  He's a little dirty, but, I mean, aside from that, he is...  If you could get past the filth that comes out of his show.  And believe it or not, and I respect that.  I mean, a guy that can be really funny and not dirty.  I mean, it's not an easy thing to do.  And Brian Regan pulls it off every single time he comes to town.  And he has new material every time he comes to town.  You're not...  A lot of these comedians, they come to New York three, four times a year, and you're watching 
[00:54:30]  the same act over and over again.  Hey, I write some new stuff.  Regan is known for doing, like, almost...  He can do...  He'll do one show on an early show, and people love him so much.  Sometimes they stay, he'll actually do another set, or an 80% to 90% or an entirely different  set on the late show.  He's legendary for that.  We've been known, when he's at Caroline's, to stay for all three shows, because sometimes  he does three shows on, like, a Saturday.  We stay for all three, and we see three different shows.  Oh, you go backstage to talk to him, and he'll say, hey, I saw you out there, I figured 
[00:55:00]  I'd do a whole new act.  Yeah.  Okay?  I saw you stay for a second show, I did a...  I did it for you.  I did a whole new act for you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Anthony and I are actually in a very good mood.  Why, Opie?  Things are happening.  Things?  Things are happening.  Did you talk to Super Agent Bob?  Oh, things are happening.  I was just asking if you spoke to him yesterday.  Things are happening.  Did he call you?  Things are happening.  But what, Opie?  After we spoke, did Bob talk to you? 
[00:55:30]  Things are happening.  I just want to know, because he didn't call me.  I know.  Did he call you back?  He didn't call you, because he's very busy, Anthony.  He's very busy.  I left a message.  Oh, you wait!  Let's see what happens next!  Oh, the devil!  Oh, it's just Opie.  Oh, I thought Satan himself had come up from the bowels of hell.  I know.  And started screaming.  Thank you.  Don't ever do that in Steve's shirt.  It'll be a complete picture.  It's my new character, thank you.  The devil.  Thank you, I like that.  He scares the bejesus out of me. 
[00:56:00]  You know how we say, Opie and Anthony always win in the end.  Yes.  Opie, because I called Bob.  Wait till you see what we do next.  I called up Bob Eatman.  You just wait.  What?  And I didn't even get a ring.  What?  I got that direct to...  Oh, he's much too busy.  And it's so exciting to hear.  Hello, you've reached Robert Eatman.  Please leave a message after the tone, and I'll get back to you.  Woo!  The excitement that is Robert Eatman.  When you hear his voice, you actually miss the joy and variance of the ring. 
[00:56:30]  Thank you for laughing through variance, even though I meant to say variation.  I like it.  I understood.  Yeah, I'm doing zoning law jokes.  In my world, that word made perfect sense.  Thank you.  You're the devil.  All right.  Well, I got to talk to Bob Bobby.  You really should get on the phone with Super Agent Bobby.  That's why I figured he probably had, in a high-level meeting, had his phone off.  Wait till you see what we do next.  When it doesn't ring, you know, it's off, and it goes right to voicemail. 
[00:57:00]  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I'll talk to him today.  We are attempting the biggest comeback in radio history.  Dun-dun-dun-dun.  You just wait and see.  Yes.  Wait and see.  Yeah.  Juliana, what's up?  Hi.  How y'all doing?  Pretty good.  We got to take a break, but you got something about crabs?  Yeah, actually, it's body crabs and everything.  Body crabs?  You're a trucker?  Yes.  You got crabs while being on the road?  No, no, no, no.  This was way before I became a truck driver. 
[00:57:30]  I was dating this guy for a while, and I went down on him, and I couldn't figure out what  was going on, and I looked down, and he had crabs down there.  Oh, and you had, like, you were eye-to-eye with the little guys?  Yeah.  Oh, my.  You're drinking out of his mule, and there's a crab looking at you with his hands on his  hips, like, what are you doing?  Pretty much.  Get out of my neighborhood.  Yeah, well, I packed my shit, and I left, you know?  Oh, you did?  Did you have to fling them off your face after you were done?  They were in my eyelashes.  I had to pluck my eyelashes out.  You could have been a trooper and finished the job. 
[00:58:00]  Just put little rubber bands on their claws and finish up.  No.  You had it in your eyelashes?  They were in my eyelashes.  I had to pluck my eyelashes out.  Stop it.  Oh, my God.  I'm getting sick.  You had to pluck your eyelashes out because you had crabs, and all of a sudden, you'd  see something in your eye and go, what's that?  No, no, no, no.  When I left there, I had a friend of mine check me out, and they were just, like, all over  me.  I mean, they were everywhere.  I had to get the shit out of my hair.  I had to shave down there.  I had to pluck my eyelashes out.  I had to shave my eyebrows the whole nine yards. 
[00:58:30]  Wowee.  I was mad.  How did you explain to everybody why you had to pluck your eyebrows and eyelashes out?  It's a new look.  I tried to play it off with fake eyelashes, and it didn't work too hot.  Fake eyelashes with little fake crabs in them?  Why not?  It was horrible.  It was horrible.  This was, like, 17 years ago, you know?  Wow.  Crabs on the face.  Nice.  I didn't know there was such a thing. 
[00:59:00]  You're lucky you didn't get any in between your teeth, and maybe they would have burrowed  under your gums.  That's disgusting.  Thanks for sharing, Juliana.  You guys have a wonderful day, and I will be shining up for you guys and everything.  I just listened to you guys for the first time yesterday.  Thank you, ma'am.  Oh, man.  It just proves my theory that XM just has to get us off the premium channel.  It doesn't make sense anymore.  There are so many people that will be turned on to the show by just stumbling across it.

Brought to you by your pals  at the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:05:30]  XM202.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  I say, don't you know?  You say, you don't know.  I say, take me out.  I say, you don't show.  Don't move, time is low.  I say, take me out.  Oh, okay. 
[01:06:00]  Whoever finishes their bite first  has to start talking.  They got to start.  Hey, welcome back  to the Opie and Anthony program.  You're still chewing.  Wow.  What are you eating today, Opie?  Granola.  Do I see a banana in there?  A little banana, granola?  Sure.  I'm sick of that oatmeal stuff.  Nice to see you eating, though, this morning.  I kind of liked the yesterday show.  I listened to the replay.  I'm like, wow.  I was really out of it yesterday.  You listened to the replay,  and it was the first time you heard it.  Without a doubt. 
[01:06:30]  Without a doubt.  Yeah, that'll happen.  Got another crab story,  and then we're going to move on  to some other things here.  Jim the Trucker.  What's up, Jim?  Hey, you guys have a great show.  I listen to you all the time.  Oh, thank you.  I just had a comment to make  about the last caller  that called in about crabs.  She didn't need to shave everything off.  They make shampoos for that.  And a story...  Are you guys still there?  Oh, yeah.  We're good listeners.  We just shut up  and let people talk here. 
[01:07:00]  When I was in the Army,  we deployed out the white sands  for 30 days to do maneuvers.  A couple of guys came up hot with crabs,  and they quarantined the whole unit.  The doc had the audacity  that we were all in formation.  The doc came out  and showed us how to apply the cream  and had the audacity to suggest  that our buddies helped get it on our backs, too,  which obviously didn't happen.  You mean by backs, what?  Like, ass? 
[01:07:30]  Yeah.  The doc suggested...  All those areas you can't reach.  You know, you've got to get rid of the crabs.  I mean, because the crabs  will just move over to the back, I guess.  Right.  And your ass hair.  That's all I have to say, guys.  All right.  Thank you, buddy.  Yeah, perhaps you could figure out  a way to do it yourself.  Knowing your Army buddies  applying anything to your ass.  Yeah.  Another trucker, Earl.  What's up, buddy?  Hey, what's going on, man?  Let me show you.  Thank you, sir.  I just wanted to comment on the traffic. 
[01:08:00]  You bitching about traffic?  Well, welcome to our world.  Hold on, Earl.  Where are you driving to?  I'm in North Carolina, going to Charlotte.  Have you ever driven in New York City traffic?  Yes, sir, I have.  All right.  Because it really is insane.  Yeah, yeah.  It is insane.  You could drive four blocks in an hour  in New York City at times.  Four blocks in an hour.  Yeah.  It's absolutely insane.  I don't know why people bring their cars 
[01:08:30]  into Manhattan at this point.  Well, hey, that's all I have to say about it.  Y'all have a good day, shit dick.  All right.  Thank you, shit dick.  Easy with that shit dick.  There was a guy yesterday.  Like I said, I was stuck in traffic.  And I'm not a guy that goes into the intersection  and stops and blocks traffic for everybody.  I'll wait.  I'll hang back a little bit.  Traffic's moving.  The light starts turning red.  I stop.  My bumper was probably, really, I'm being serious,  two feet into the crosswalk.  Huge Manhattan crosswalks. 
[01:09:00]  Two feet in, it's nothing.  Believe me.  There's a truck next to me that was really blocking the crosswalk.  So this guy is walking through, and he looked like that guy of Phil.  Phil Conner.  Remember that from Groundhog Day?  Ned?  Ned.  Ned Ryerson?  Ned Ryerson.  There's Ned Ryerson.  You never saw Groundhog Day?  No, it's funny, right?  Oh, I love that movie.  Are you insane?  Absolutely love that movie.  Yeah, that's funny.  It's a great movie.  Looked like Ned Ryerson.  Sure.  And he's crossing the, he's in the crosswalk, and he gets by my bumper and looks at me, 
[01:09:30]  gives this, like, smirk and waves at me like, you asshole, you're in my crosswalk.  And there is pandemonium, automotive pandemonium, pedestrian pandemonium going on around me.  And I'm two feet into the crosswalk, and he gives me crap, and I'm already bubbling.  I'm bubbling.  Map!  I lay on the horn right when he goes in front.  And, uh...  You're an amateur. 
[01:10:00]  What are you supposed to do?  You should have went old school, like I did, the time that you...  And lose my mirror?  Yeah.  Like you did?  Man, I had a brand new, uh, what was I driving?  S10 Blazer.  I didn't hit him, Opie.  I know.  I had a brand new S10 Blazer.  This goes back about five years ago, and we were driving out of Manhattan, and Anthony  and I were commuting back then, because we were living pretty close, and we took turns  driving in.  And, yeah, same situation, kind of in the crosswalk.  Yeah.  Um, and this guy's taking a sweet old time as he's walking in front of my car, and everyone 
[01:10:30]  knows I got, I'm just an asshole, and, you know, I got this psychotic thing that pops  out from time to time in my head.  Well, here's what they do, though.  You'll be stopped, uh, because there's too much traffic, so you'll have a green light.  The light's green for you, but you can't move because there's cars in front of you.  Now, the pedestrians will take this opportunity to cross, even though it says, don't walk,  because all the cars are stopped.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  What the hell was that? 
[01:11:00]  Ah, Steve just fell down, he tripped over something.  He tripped over a garbage can.  He was trying to be so quiet.  He's tiptoeing in behind Opie to give Opie some kind of a CD or something.  And then he tries to tiptoe out, and it fell down, almost set the place on fire.  Yeah, I was trying to be careful, and I tripped over the goddamn garbage can.  Nice flame shirt and poison t-shirt.  That's good.  What do you got there today?  This is the coup de grace.  Yeah, this is the coup de grace with the flame attire.  Then after this, I got nothing.  Yeah, it's a poison shirt, and then I got another. 
[01:11:30]  You got nothing?  You finally ran out of shirts.  We've been on the air.  I think this is our 50th show, so you got 50 flame shirts.  Well, no, I rotate them.  You know what I was telling Ann yesterday?  I don't think you rotate them.  I think I've seen a different flame shirt every day.  I think so, too.  Every day this week.  Every day this week, you actually have.  I got a brand new box, and they came in on Monday, so I started wearing them on Tuesday.  Big asbestos box coming up at his door.  I left a bunch of them in the hotel in Cleveland.  I'm very upset about that, so I had to replace them.  All right.  What did you just hand me?  Danny with the Falun Gong people yesterday. 
[01:12:00]  Is this audio better than Eric's?  Yes, I think so.  It's pretty good.  Wow.  We can go right to this, then.  All right.  So anyway, to finish the story.  Yeah, so the guy's crossing in front of us, and the light is green for us, so when it  opens up, there shouldn't be pedestrians in front of you.  I think it's the pedestrian's responsibility to make sure that you're not interfering with  traffic.  If the light's green for the car, you've got to be out of the guy's way.  So he wasn't out of the way, and he's walking real slow.  Real slow, and you have your opportunity, because you've got to get to the next light. 
[01:12:30]  I mean, you don't have time to mess around here.  Right.  You know, just that little moment of time that you're missing there isn't it.  It's what it adds up to be over time.  The whole timing thing.  Now you miss the next light.  Yeah, it screws you up.  So what does Opie do?  Starts moving his vehicle up a little bit to tell the guy, perhaps, hey, get a move  on, which made the guy slow down a little more.  So now he's challenging me.  I'm like, well, all right.  So I move a little closer to him.  He's slowed down. 
[01:13:00]  A little closer?  Well, it happened a couple times, and he slowed down, and now we have a problem.  So I'm like, okay, we've got a problem.  So I bumped him with my car.  So Opie hits the guy with his car, you let off the brake, rolled right into his thigh  with your bumper.  Right.  The guy got jolted a little.  Not a tiny bit.  He got jolted a little bit.  He could have just brushed it off and kept walking.  He could have.  Right.  But he chose not to.  No, he chose not to.  I didn't realize that he was just a maniac like myself, and he decided to take out my entire 
[01:13:30]  side view mirror.  He comes over to my side.  Right.  Says, now remember, it's an S10 blazer.  It's those, not fancy, but it's all wired and automatic.  Oh, it's not just the rear side view mirror that's hanging off like an old rambler.  You guys know.  You hear the guy through the rolled up windows.  It's like, you motherfucker.  Fucking asshole.  Took out the whole side view mirror with one punch.  One punch.  So now the thing is just hanging by the wire.  The cable that moves the mirror.  Yeah.  And then now from behind us, meh, meh, meh, because now the light's green, and then 
[01:14:00]  it's open.  Yeah.  So I kind of looked at him and just went, okay, you win.  You won that one.  There's nothing I can do now.  Made us his bitch, that guy.  Yeah, he sure did.  You shouldn't have bumped him.  He was a big guy.  Right?  He was big, right?  I think so.  We weren't just complete pussies.  Some little mousy fellow.  Nah, this guy.  You hit me.  Nah, he was big.  And then.  What about your side car?  My friend Harvey's gonna beat you up.  And then, you know, it was a nice car at the time, so now I got the side view that's just 
[01:14:30]  hanging by the cables.  And I decided to wait at least three months to get it fixed.  Yeah.  And so that thing's just swinging every time I drove the car.  It was making this crescent moon-shaped thing because it was like a compass.  Yeah.  You know, it kept a perfectly round flow on his door.  And just wrecked the whole side panel.  Just because I was an ass.  Lazy.  Definitely lazy.  Is it bad if you get like a little numbness in your left arm? 
[01:15:00]  Is that supposed to be a bad sign?  Occasionally, like it falls asleep?  Huh.  Maybe your circulation's a little bad, Jimmy.  Okay.  I need to exercise.  So we gotta play some Falun Gong today, man.  We like messing with these people.  I saw them the other day after we did the Bravo taping.  Yeah, they're another bunch that just makes traffic lovely.  Like enough crap ain't happening here.  Where's the info on this group?  Somebody sent an email that we should have in a pile somewhere.  And I hope he wants some information, please. 
[01:15:30]  You know, it makes you start wanting, like the traffic yesterday when the guy gave me that  stupid passive-aggressive look and wave and then crossed the street.  I was honestly saying, I hope the big Christmas tree at Rockefeller Center falls down on people.  And I was thinking maybe a dirty bomb wouldn't be all that bad in the long run.  You know, just whittle down a few of the morons that are traipsing around.  You just don't have the holiday spirit, Anthony. 
[01:16:00]  Holiday spirit.  People come in to check out the Christmas tree every year at this time.  They're all around Radio City taking pictures of the wooden soldiers up on the roof.  They wait in line to look at the window displays.  Get their tickets for the Christmas show, the Christmas spectacular at Radio City.  Yeah, you know what?  New Yorkers don't feel the spirit as much as like the Midwesterners that come into town  for a week at a time or whatever during the holiday.  You could totally tell, you know, who are the people that have the spirit and everyone else. 
[01:16:30]  Those are.  Yeah.  Did any of you guys go near 6th Avenue right here yesterday on like 55th?  Because you had the NBA office with our test and all those guys were in there.  And then you had the Fallon Gong.  And then you had the Taurus going to Radio City.  Couldn't even get down the sidewalk.  You cannot move.  5th and 6th are just gone.  Madison, gone.  Fighting for cabs?  People were fighting for cabs?  Oh yeah, they actually get into fistfights to get cabs.  For the pleasure, the honor of sitting and smelling an animal's ass for a few miles. 
[01:17:00]  Oh dude, I forgot to tell you.  See, this stuff happens in my life all the time.  For me, it's just normal.  But I guess it makes good fodder for the show.  After our meeting with Elo last night, you know, it was rainy and cold.  Yeah.  Oh no.  He just said fighting for a cab.  I almost got beat up.  The guy was twice as big as me.  And I see a cab, so I'm running toward the cab.  It's obvious it's my cab. 
[01:17:30]  Yeah.  This business guy with an umbrella, he sees me running and decides he's going to try to beat me to the cab.  I'm like, you've got to be kidding.  So he gets in and I go, look you motherfucker, that was my cab.  And just losing my mind, right?  He goes, well, maybe we could share the cab.  I go, I don't think so.  I take the cab door, wham, right in his face.  I don't think so.  Did you almost have the cab as you looked at him across the street when you tripped over somebody's luggage? 
[01:18:00]  Yeah, in planes, trains, and automobiles.  I was kind of thinking that, you know?  But the guy was like, you knew, I go, you knew that was my cab, motherfucker.  Yeah.  And I'm just losing it.  And, you know, most people would like challenge at that point.  He's like, well, maybe we could share the cab.  He was being nice.  So I drop my umbrella.  I take both hands on the cab door because he's sort of in and he's getting ready to close the door.  And I just, bam, right in his face.  That's nice.  He stole your cab and then you acted like a doorman. 
[01:18:30]  You gently closed it for him.  Yeah, you closed the door for him.  You showed him.  I'll show you.  Close the door.  Take him to the airport.  Oh, man.  Wow.  Nice.  It is.  Yeah, it's a jungle.  It's just a jungle.  It really is.  So you've got to explain the Falun Gong for the new listeners, Anthony.  I'm trying to remember.  Oh, you got it here?  Falun Gong.  It's a bunch of Chinese people that are persecuted over there in China.  So for some reason, see, they're persecuted and killed and tortured in China. 
[01:19:00]  So they decide they have to, in New York, protest it.  Why don't you go over to China?  This is weird.  Okay.  It's a spiritual practice that consists of gentle exercises and postures combined with a meditation component.  What?  A lot of people kind of say it's like Tai Chi or yoga.  Yeah, it's a cult.  And it's practiced in over 50 countries.  And it was made public in May of 1992. 
[01:19:30]  Let's see.  Okay.  Why is it being persecuted?  When Chinese leader...  Bang, bang.  Bang, bang.  Bang, bang.  Bang, bang.  Bang, bang.  That little kid in Platoon.  Oh.  Dude, she would have shot her.  Shut her up.  But you nailed it.  These Chinese names sound like those little, you know, planes.  I-planes.  Oh, the little remote control airplane. 
[01:20:00]  Yeah.  Stop.  So when Chinese leader...  They see!  ...banned...  I guess this Chinese leader banned Falun Gong.  On July 20th, 1999, he banned it, okay?  They're saying up to 100 million people in China were suddenly cast into the role of criminals.  They got a bunch of them over there.  There are many theories regarding the reasons behind this incomprehensible act.  Superficially, it looked like the entire Chinese government had decided to eliminate the practice. 
[01:20:30]  Emerging evidence suggests, however, that it was...  A lone who was responsible, fearing the growing numbers of practitioners and jealous of the practice's popularity, among other reasons.  Here it is with China.  So this guy just didn't like yoga and decided to ban this.  Good for him.  In China, their whole government depends on their communist government depends on their people not getting together in any way, shape, or form into any type of groups that have something in common because it's a threat to their government. 
[01:21:00]  They don't want it, whether it's them having yoga and getting together as a group that does yoga or a group that wants to overthrow the government.  They see it the same way.  They see it as a threat.  So they're breaking up the group.  And the way you do that is to make people fearful to be in the group.  And the way you do that is to torture them.  And supposedly, as of July 2003, well, that's like a year and a half ago, thousands of people have died because they're trying to practice this yoga. 
[01:21:30]  I'm on the side of the Chinese government with this one.  What are you going to push yourself into a pretzel to get some zen, do you?  Yuck.  Why don't you work on a facial expression?  I was killed for doing yoga.  Nah, shut up.  And you try to talk to any of them, and they're just...  Many of them have had to go to talk to me like, what?  So, yeah.  So we send Danny and the gang out from time to time to talk to these people.  And we're trying to figure out what they're all about. 
[01:22:00]  Yeah, we're open to it.  So here's Danny, the intern, talking to the leader of Falun Gong.  Danny.  So who's the leader of Falun Gong?  Lee Hong.  Not a leader.  It's our teacher.  He teach us this.  What's his name?  Lee Hong-Zhi.  Does he have, like, superpowers?  We don't say he has superpowers, but he teach us...  Like, x-ray vision? 
[01:22:30]  We didn't say that.  Because he teach us to be a good person.  So many people like to practice Falun Gong.  Also, Falun Gong is a very good practice for health.  Only seven years in China, 100 million people practice Falun Gong.  Chinese former leader Jiang Zemin, he is afraid to lose control over people's men.  Also, he is a persecution company as a racist suggestion of his political power.  Once again, we have no idea what these people do and what they're trying to accomplish. 
[01:23:00]  We forgot to tell everyone they have, like, these displays right on the sidewalk where they have people in torture positions with, like, makeup, bad makeup.  They put them in cages and show them shackled inside the cages.  Yeah, they do, like, a live recreation of some of the tortures that supposedly take place in China.  And they stand...  Last time they screwed me up, they were doing, like, a hands-down 6th Avenue, where they just made a complete line of people down 6th, so you couldn't make a turn off of 6th. 
[01:23:30]  Made me want to get out and torture them.  How annoying is it?  Do it in China where it counts.  Don't do it on 6th Avenue.  Right, what is the purpose of protesting some kind of faraway problem here in New York when people are trying to work?  You're not getting sympathy.  You're getting people angry at you, is what you get.  More angry than the Chinese.  Actually, I, uh...  What?  You what?  Nothing.  Would you donate money?  Did you donate?  No, no, no, no.  Well, it's a bad question.  I decided to walk home from the Bravo tape, and I walked, you know, through there. 
[01:24:00]  That's why we got this audio, because I told the guys they're back out there, right?  And, uh, one lady was trying to hand me a flyer, and I went...  No, you did the whap, the whap down, whack, out of her hand.  Yeah, I, I don't know what's wrong with me.  You're real tough when someone's not attacking your mirror, aren't you?  Right, I know.  Well, let it be a little Asian lady in a flyer, and all of a sudden the devil comes out.  I know, I, trust me, I know.  If someone, come gorilla punches your mirror, you're like, oh, sorry, sir, my fault, didn't mean to hit you. 
[01:24:30]  You don't think I, I know I'm an a-hole?  I like the, uh, I like the asking if the leader has superpowers.  Well, um, Danny goes on with the superpower thing in this next clip.  By doing Falun Gong, uh, it doesn't give you any kind of special powers.  And not special powers.  It's, uh, for health.  For example, if you have the disease, you can gain better health.  So you can't, so you can't turn invisible?  Yes, invisible.  So you'll see the people, they're only 70 years old, and even 70, 80 years old, they look very young, look like 50 years old. 
[01:25:00]  Oh, cool.  Yeah, this is a very good practice.  Oh, he says, yes, they can become invisible.  We've gotten that from him.  Yeah.  And, uh, it's for your health.  And if you're 70, you can look like you're 50.  Okay.  If you, uh, if you, uh, do this Falun Gong.  All right.  Crap.  More audio from Danny.  Now, now, do you give happy endings as well?  Yeah.  Uh, it can release the pressure. 
[01:25:30]  Release the pressure.  Release the pressure.  So, you know, society, if you, uh, work day after day, day after day, and then you feel much more pressure.  You, after you practice, you feel very relaxed.  Got that right.  The pressure builds up, right, Jim?  Yeah.  So you need a happy ending.  So what have we learned?  You can, you can become invisible.  No, no x-ray vision, but you can become invisible.  Yeah.  Uh, at 70, you'll be 50.  Yeah.  And, uh, happy ending.  And they give happy endings. 
[01:26:00]  I'm kind of appreciating Falun Gong.  Yeah, I do like that.  All right.  One might be in the room right now.  We wouldn't know.  Two more clips here.  Now, have you ever set yourself on Steve to, in, in, in protest?  Uh, actually, uh, we, we, we ask the Chinese government to stop the persecution.  And we're never against the government.  We're never against the Communist Party.  Set yourself on Steve.  Well, these are the guys that, uh, set themselves on fire.  Yeah, in protest. 
[01:26:30]  In protest and stuff.  Great way to protest.  Yeah, that's, that's brilliant.  That'll show you.  That'll show them.  Yeah.  We have a little mushu pork pile in the road.  And the final clip from Danny as he attempts to try to figure out what this Falun Gong is all about.  Uh, what other things do they do to your, to Falun Gong, uh, in China?  Uh, they mislead the people because they destroy all the Falun Gong materials.  And, uh, nobody knows the, knows the truth.  So they can use the, uh, state-run propaganda to mislead the people. 
[01:27:00]  They can slander the Falun Gong.  So nobody knows the truth.  So everybody, they believe it from the government.  So even...  Do they, do they set you guys on fire?  Uh, no, they set themselves.  I have, uh, on the fair.  And it is said that it's a Falun Gong.  For example, the people that...  I had no idea Steve ever went to China.  For example, uh, some people they have, they don't want to leave, they're suicide.  And they found out, oh, this is people's suicide is, then these are the TV's to propaganda. 
[01:27:30]  This is Falun Gong.  Falun Gong teaches people to suicide.  Actually, he's not Falun Gong.  We're not laughing at the clip.  I know.  That last clip was awful.  I have no idea what he was saying.  I don't know what he was talking about.  So once again, we don't know what these, uh, guys are trying to accomplish.  Yeah.  Here in New York, protesting China.  Right.  What's the matter, Ben?  You put too much hot sauce on your little, uh, home fries, did you?  That was so funny.  Ben just poured the hot sauce on his breakfast and took a mouthful, and he's like, ha, ha. 
[01:28:00]  Well, not only was there a little midget that was just proposed to him, and the home fries  are hot, too, so it was like double whammy.  That's why Ben opens the windows, I'm convinced, though, because he has, like, hot sauce dumps  that are probably stringy and liquidy.  Sweating like a madman in there.  Yeah, his head is, his teeth clenched.  Someone, someone walked into the bathroom when little Benny made a duty when he was a boy.  When Ben was young, like, when he was, like, seven or eight, he was probably in a kindergarten 
[01:28:30]  or whatever the age is.  Kindergarten.  And somebody walked in and went, pew, Ben has stinky duties, and now he is scarred and  has to open the window at 5 o'clock.  No, I just hate it.  I'm like Anthony.  I hate going to the, it's just gross.  I don't like the smells, but, but the cold, and especially in there, the whole bathroom is  like marble or something.  Yeah, yeah.  It looks like a mausoleum when you walk in there, and it, it's just, it holds the cold.  If I gotta go, I go down to the Four Seasons Hotel.  I just walk down a few blocks.  Because it's nice and clean, you know?  You walk a few blocks with a log hanging out, what's the matter with you? 
[01:29:00]  I don't want to run into Opie or you in there when they're, you know.  Ben's wrapping at the Four Seasons.  Yeah, kid.  Nice, you made it.  Hey, when's Brian Regan going to be here?  He's here.  He's just signing his paperwork.  All right, so we'll see him at about 8.45.  Are you insane?  We only have him for 15.  I know, he's going to be in in two seconds.  Why does Brian have to fill out the paperwork?  Why does Brian have to fill out the paperwork?  For what?  I'll do the wiffle ball back.  I'll do it.  Can we, should we take a quick break, then?  Quick break and he'll be ready to go.  All right, Brian Regan next.  First, we're getting a request for this little...  Paperwork?  With this little Christmas ditty.

[01:38:00]  That's right  That's great if it was February, you know  Yeah, or if it cost like $40 a month  I like when furniture companies advertise  That you won't have to pay until the next year  You know, like  No one can sit down and figure that out  Well, it's November now  We don't have to pay until next year  For this table  We'd be crazy not to get it  Make no payments till next year at Siemens 
[01:38:30]  So Brian, you were on our last show  Yes  And I mean, we've talked to them on the phone  Since getting this new gig at XM Satellite Radio  Congratulations, by the way  We only had to wait two years and four months  Two years in exile  That was the last time we saw you, you know, face to face  Two years, four months  Two years, he was the guest on our last show  And I think that's why it was our last show  With you  Potty mouth and FCC violations  I know, I'm here to apologize formally  Flying out of you like that 
[01:39:00]  Remember how uncomfortable that day was?  Oh my gosh  We were like talking in code  We were talking about the Sex for Sam thing  By referring it to as the peanut butter and jelly incident  Or whatever  Oh, that's right  I forgot about that  Remember?  Because we couldn't talk about it  The bosses had put a gag order on us  And Brian is just in studio  He just wants to sell some tickets to his gig  And all hell is breaking loose around us  He's thinking, why didn't I cancel my appearance too?  No, no, I wouldn't have done that  No, man, you hung in there until the end  And we appreciate that  Yeah, no problem, man  So people were tuning in 
[01:39:30]  And hearing the peanut butter and jelly references  Going, what did Brian do?  Yeah  What did he do with that routine?  That has turned so many people off  The Catholic Church is so upset  Peanut butter and jelly  I don't get it  Yeah  So, anyway  You've been very busy  As you usually are  Touring  How many times  How many shows you do a year  Would you say?  I do three shows  Three  The first one's free  Yeah  The first one's free 
[01:40:00]  The second one they pay for  And then the third one  We just see how that goes  I don't know  You know, I try not to go out too often  Because I have a wife and children  I've been told  Yeah, now this is something  You weren't a daddy two years ago, were you?  Yeah, yeah  I've got a five and a half year old boy  And a little baby girl now, too  But you had a little baby  Yeah  Wow, we haven't seen you in a while  I remember when you had your son  That seemed like yesterday  He's five and a half now?  Yeah, he's five and a half 
[01:40:30]  Wow  And, you know, I try to be funny around him  And, you know, sometimes  I just want to be myself  But, you know, sometimes  And he'll say things like  Daddy, that's funny  Just not funny enough for me to laugh  And he's not being a Weisenheimer  He's like, you know, he's like  Just that's what he feels  He's just concerned about my feelings  Yeah  You make people laugh all over the country  But you can't make your own son laugh  I love that  He says it with a straight face  It's funny, just not funny enough for me to laugh  Oh, I understand, son 
[01:41:00]  I understand  I'll try harder  It's not worth my energy, Dad  To really give a good guffaw  Have you done the snow cone bit for him?  Maybe that one will make him laugh  No, I don't want to do  I don't want to perform for him  You don't want to do material for him?  Yeah, I just want to be Daddy  You should set up a nice brick wall  And a microphone  And sit him down there  Spotlight  Spotlight  I got him for Christmas last year  I got him like a microphone stand  But, like, it's for kids 
[01:41:30]  It's like a bright yellow microphone stand  It's a little one  And it has two foot pedals  One for laughter  And one for applause  And I find myself so envious of his mic stand  I mean, if I only had the two foot pedals  I could get through every show  I don't care what you guys do, folks  I got it right here  What was it?  Do you remember what that's called?  No  Is it the stand-up comic play set or something?  I don't know  That actually has more dignity than playing a guitar on stage 
[01:42:00]  And the crowd would not even know that you're bombing  Because you just blow them over with the volume of the laughter  That's coming out of the mic stand  Every joke kills  Every joke kills  I don't need you, folks  That's a little scary  I like that, though  That it's even  They've even got the niche for the stand-up comic dad  You know?  Like, I can understand  You go to the toy store  And if you're a construction worker  You get the little tool belt for your son 
[01:42:30]  You know, you're a doctor  They got the little doctor kit for your son  I never knew that there was a stand-up comedy thing  There's a whole aisle  There's a little fake bottle of Jack Daniels  To drown your sorrows in  Yeah, and a hot chick telling you how much her boyfriend liked you  Yeah, the little Barbie doll  You pull the string  Oh, man  That's great  So that's what's going on there  Good, and you're raising  I like that you're raising your children in a nice, wholesome city  Yeah, yeah  Where do you live now? 
[01:43:00]  Vegas  Las Vegas  Across the street from Siegfried and Roy  Wonderful  You know, they have local elections there  And they put the billboards on the side of the road  The candidates would have their name  And then two one-word qualities  You're supposed to make your decision based on this  John Smith  Leadership  Integrity  Oh, say no more  That's what I'm looking for right there 
[01:43:30]  The only way that would be helpful  Is if his opponent had a billboard right next to it  Steve Roberts  Laziness  Thievery  Oh, no  I don't think so, Mr. Roberts  I think I like this guy on the left  Why Vegas, man?  Yeah, how do you pick Vegas?  Uh, well, you know, because of my gambling and drinking 
[01:44:00]  Right, makes perfect sense  Womanizing  Womanizing  Yeah  Is that a verb?  Womanized  Womanized  I'm going to go out and do some womanizing tonight  My wife's family's from there  Oh  Yeah, when we knew we were going to have another child  I wanted her to have some help when I did go out on the road  Right  You know, so  Did you not want to move to Vegas?  No, I like it  I know you like it now  She's not listening right now  I know you like it now  She's not? 
[01:44:30]  Tell us the truth, Brian  No, I love it  I truly do  Because some guys are forced to maybe make some  And some women are forced to make moves  Based on the guy's job or something like that  But it just, you know  I like it there, man  You like it?  I like getting out of  Because I was living in L.A.  And the whole L.A. thing was, you know  Getting a little tiring, you know  You ask people in L.A.  How you doing?  I've got an audition tomorrow  I've got a script coming through the fax machine  I just wanted to know how you were doing, man  I'm up for a pilot 
[01:45:00]  Okay, relax, relax  Can you take my breakfast order now?  Yeah  All of them  Yes  Congratulations  I'll take another orange juice  Let's go to the phone and talk to Toolbag  What's up, Toolbag?  Good morning, Tildos  How are you?  Very good  We're doing well  What's going on with you?  Nothing much  I just had some eggs for breakfast  You just had some eggs for breakfast?  And I was wondering if Brian ever put dirt in a cup 
[01:45:30]  Oh, no  That is the worst setup I've ever heard  Brian's used to the bad setups on this show  Well, but that was the worst ever  I just had some breakfast  Breakfast?  Yeah, man  Absolutely  Toolbag?  Toolbag, yeah  From New Orleans  That's a cool name  From New Orleans  It's the school  The whole school thing is about six minutes long  So I'd feel awkward  Yeah, he picked a nice long one 
[01:46:00]  Set it up badly  He really did a good job  Everyone else in the studio  Just get up and leave  He's going to be doing a school thing  This thing is about 19 minutes  Yeah, I think we need shorter setups  Well, he gave way part of the punchline, too  The cup of dirt's a great, funny line  Yeah  It's a cup of dirt, which is great  And this idiot gives it away  Hey, Brian  He's a good guy  He stinks  Not a good guy  He's a good guy  Brian, when you were growing up  Were you into Evel Knievel like Anthony and I?  Oh, man  I just thought I had asked that question  Yeah  I think that bit's only a minute 48 
[01:46:30]  Yeah, give or take  Give or take a few seconds  Yeah  Evel Knievel  I saw him again the other day  He gets interviewed  And whenever he's on a talk show  The interviewer wants to ask him  You know  What it was like at Caesar's Palace  When he fell off the motorcycle  And bounced around like 83 times  What were you thinking  Right before you fell off the motorcycle?  What were you thinking?  Oh, I remember thinking  Hey, did I turn off the iron? 
[01:47:00]  Then my leg snapped in half  Then I was thinking  Hey, maybe I should get a puppy  What do you think I was thinking?  I was thinking  Something like that  If I remember right  I believe I've crystallized my thoughts  Yeah, see?  There you go  That's a quickie  That's how it's done  The yellow one's the sun  So what did he call you guys? 
[01:47:30]  Dildos  That's the difference between  The other radio and satellite  Oh, yeah, you concurse  So you get greeted with  Hey, dildos  Hey, dildos  You're on the air  Oh, thanks, dildos  Am I on, dildos?  We're also called shit dicks  If you really want to know  Oh, now you did  And that's going to take  A little too long  To explain to you, Brian Regan  Whatever happened to gentlemen?  Well, gentlemen  Kind of overplayed  Call you guys gentlemen?  Kind of overplayed in the year 2004 
[01:48:00]  Years ago  When broadcasters used to show up  In their suits and ties  It's radio  But they used to show up  To work in the suits and ties  They were professional broadcasters  Broadcasting the news  And maybe someone would come in  And play the piano  In front of a big microphone  And they would introduce them  Did you  Did they ever dream  That there would be a medium  That we would sit here  And people would call up  And go  Yeah, shit dicks  How are you doing?  Hey, dildos  What's that rumbling I feel? 
[01:48:30]  I believe it's a radio legend  Rolling around in his grave  And I can feel him  Right through the ground  It's just how things change  For the worse sometimes  Yeah, like with Paul Harvey  You know, he's one of those  You know, guys that have been around  For years  Like such a classic, you know  Oh, yeah  And you know they just have  Such respect for the industry  And the medium  And they hate shows like this  Where we pick up the phone  To hello dildos  It just degrades 
[01:49:00]  Everything they've worked for  It's like building a monument  Spending your life  Building a monument  So people can go inside  And have sex with hookers in it  And just crap on each other  Well, maybe he'll come around  Maybe Paul Harvey will change  You know  Come around, yeah  Yeah, and go  I was having sex with  I can't do a Paul Harvey  Well, I thought all of a sudden  Johnny Carson had taken over  Paul Harvey's  I do one voice 
[01:49:30]  He's pretty much interchangeable  Having sex with  Hey, Tom in Jersey  Has a question for Brian Regan  Get off with the sloss  And cut off  Cut off your sloss  And  Wow  Go ahead, Tom  Karnak  Yes  Hey, Karnak  You guys suck  Thank you, sir  Hey, Brian  I was curious  While you're in town  Are you staying at a friend's house  Or are you staying at a hotel?  Oh, that's  Hey  That's a very good question  That's a good question  Because he is from Vegas  He's in New York  He's playing Carolines all weekend long 
[01:50:00]  Yeah, where are you staying?  Yeah, I'm actually staying at a friend's house  And I'm sleeping on their fold-out couch  Which is  I get a kick out of people  When people assume you don't want to stay in a hotel  Oh, you don't want to stay in a nice hotel  You want to stay with us and be uncomfortable for a few days  You know, I don't mind staying in a hotel  We won't have it  We won't have it  You're going to stay with us and sleep on our fold-out couch  What did I do?  People don't sleep on their own fold-out couch 
[01:50:30]  They have no idea what a torture rack the thing is  A mattress about the size of a crepe  There's a death bar going right down the middle  It's like you're sleeping on the top of a doghouse  Oh, yeah  This is nice  Feeling good  Feeling good about life  Did you sleep well?  Yeah, once I got onto the couch with the dog  Using their guest bathroom 
[01:51:00]  People's guest bathrooms are sometimes like way too nice  They're like little museums  They should put like a velvet rope at the door  You know, and you can just look in  Oh, that's nice  Where do I go?  You got some kind of bush?  Because I think I'm underqualified for your bathroom  I go in there  I couldn't find any soap  They have like this little bowl of colored shells  Which I finally figure out is the soap  And I'm afraid to use any one of them too much 
[01:51:30]  To get rid of the ridges  So I'm working my way around  And then I'm trying to carve them back in with my fingernail  Who messed up my shells?  Now I've got a bowl of balls  It was I  I am Spartacus  Oh, God  I don't know if that answers his question  I think it does  I hope he's one of the stay with people guys though  You like when you go out to LA  You stay with Bob Eatman 
[01:52:00]  You stay with Greg Brady  No, I didn't stay over Greg Brady's house  You didn't stay over Greg Brady's house?  No, no, no, no  You stay with Bob though, right?  Yeah  There's a hole upstairs  It's better than just staying at a friend's house  Who else did you stay?  You stay like when you went to Buffalo, I guess?  Did you stay with friends there?  No, no, no, no, no  You're off on this one  I'm sorry to say  I thought you did  Because I'm completely with Brian on that one  No, I love hotels  I hate staying at people's houses  I love hotels  I even love crappy hotels over people's houses  I mean, I like visiting people 
[01:52:30]  But I want to be able to say  Alright, good seeing you  Take it easy  See you later  Yeah  I'm leaving your house now  And not sleeping awkwardly here all night  And no matter how comfortable they make you  It's never as comfortable as you'd be in a hotel  When you could just kick your underwear off  And walk to the bathroom  And leave the TV on loud all night if you want  Alright, well Brian Regan's in studio  He's playing Carolines all weekend long  I think the number's 212-757-4100  Yeah, tickets are going fast if they're not gone 
[01:53:00]  Before we continue  Jimmy's a comedy club Rolodex  No, just the, I remember Stress Factory and Carolines  He's a shit-like one too  Eric, can you  The Rolly Polly Dex  Eric, can you cook my Pop-Tarts?  It's morning radio  I got some Pop-Tarts  I just so happen to have these Pop-Tarts  Oh, look at that  Eric, if you will  Give it to the intern to cook  What if he doesn't know how?  Oh, what if he doesn't know how to cook?  I don't know what  Well, hey, you don't have to worry about that  Yeah, they have directions on the box  They have two sets of directions  Yeah? 
[01:53:30]  Yeah  Now listen carefully, Eric  You're getting advice how to cook Pop-Tarts  In case you don't  If you don't understand one set of directions  You abandon that whole track  And get on something a little easier for yourself  They have a set of toaster directions  Which, believe it or not, is more than one step  How could there possibly be more than one step?  I can only think of one  Step one, toast the Pop-Tarts  Go ahead, toast them  Hey, are you still reading this? 
[01:54:00]  But they, you know  They've managed to break them into smaller increments  These are some of the actual steps  I would love to be in the room watching somebody  Who has to consult these  Number one  Remove pastry from pouch  Oh  Okay  I see where they're going with this  We're banging on all cylinders now  Number two  Insert pastry 
[01:54:30]  Vertically  They're reading toaster directions  You're going to throw the vertical concept at them?  Then they have a set of microwave directions  You can actually microwave a Pop-Tart  That just blew me away  How long does it take to toast a Pop-Tart?  A minute?  If you want them dark?  People don't have that kind of time?  I think if you need to zap fry your Pop-Tarts  Before you head out the door  You might want to loosen up your schedule  And if you look 
[01:55:00]  It says microwave on high  For three seconds  I'm not making that up  I don't think I want to wake up  And be eaten in three seconds  If the alarm goes on  I put them in  Dang, when it's late  I've got to get out of here  If you're waking  Eating and hauling in three seconds  You're booking yourself  Get tight  There you go  That helped you out?  Actually, last week  My Pop-Tarts were burned  They were burnt  They were burnt, Brian 
[01:55:30]  Did you put them in for four seconds?  I must have been four seconds  You've got to put them in for three seconds  It says it clearly right on the box  I've never seen burnt Pop-Tarts  They're that easy  I would really like to set up a new bit  But I don't know any of Brian's new bits  Because I haven't seen them in a while  We'll see them tonight  Yeah  We're going  We're all going  Everyone's going  We'll just throw words out at you  Weather  Weatherman  Eye Doctor  Are you trying?  Yeah, I want to hit a new bit  Connor Peterson  Connor Peterson 
[01:56:00]  Oh, my God  Is that Lacey Peterson reference?  Yeah  Bird sounds on TV  When they're playing golf  The Lacey Peterson thing  Uh-oh  You know, when they gave the verdict  For some reason  They wouldn't show the verdict on TV  That had to be  They had to just show a photo of them  And you could hear the audio  I have no idea why  They would show the entire trial on TV  And then the verdict  You have to listen to  But, you know  Everyone knows what the verdict was  But, like, if you were the jury foreman 
[01:56:30]  Wouldn't you be tempted  To just play around?  You know  Have you reached a verdict?  We have, Your Honor  Could you please read the verdict  For the court?  Yes, Your Honor  We, the jury  In the case against Scott Peterson  Find the defendant  Not guilty  No, no  Guilty  Guilty  Guilty  Guilty, I'm sorry  I'm sorry  Guilty  There were two boxes  I read the wrong one  I'm sorry  Guilty  Just give him that little moment 
[01:57:00]  Oh my God  Give him that OJ moment  Yeah, give him that  Oh  And then he can think about that moment  For the rest of his life  When he thought he was off the hook  Oh my God  That is good  Not guilty  That's almost a blue bit there, Brian  Are you changing your act on us?  I didn't use any foul language  I don't think  I like a bit that conjures up  A dead mother and unborn child  Yeah  He has a new daughter 
[01:57:30]  I didn't think about that angle  Yeah, he has a new daughter  Can I speculate as to why they only show?  I'm wondering if it's to keep the jury off TV  Is that a possible reason?  Yeah, but they can show  A lot of times they have the camera on the defendant  I don't think they show the jury  Maybe the judge just won't allow it  Because the media is such scumbags  They want to be spinning it towards the jury  I'm not sure  They didn't show  I didn't think they showed the jury in the OJ thing  When she stumbled through all  Oh, aren't all  We, the jury, finally defended  Aren't all  The juice 
[01:58:00]  It was her big moment  And she blew it  I thought that was a joke  I'll tell you that  When she said not guilty  Come on, now she's going to say guilty  Now do that  Now the real part  Where's the guilty part?  Where's the real  Where's the real verdict?  Hey, Dave, what's up?  Dave checking in from Brooklyn  Hey, Dave  Hey, guys, what's up?  I'm a huge fan  Brian, I've been  Always trying to catch a show  Anytime I'm in Brooklyn  Thanks  I'm in New York  But I was wondering if you can  Make my day  And actually say the C word  Live on the radio  That's not Brian's thing, man  Cheese?  That's what I'm saying 
[01:58:30]  Cheese?  Cheese, well  Yeah, I use cheese a lot in my act  It's a funny word  I'll be happy to  Cheese  He's not blue  You're not going to get  Dirty language out of him  I was hoping  You never know with him  I've heard  I've heard the word  I've heard the word  Yeah  What do you think?  I've heard the S word  And the F word  Yeah  All of them  Kenny, what's up, buddy?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hanging with Brian Regan  Yeah, I'm going to work today 
[01:59:00]  And I need to get some donuts  And I'm not sure how many to get  And I'm always a little confused  When I'm picking them out  Oh, yeah?  Yeah  You know, I think I might be able to help you with that  Oh, cool  Because I'm familiar with these donut places  I'm actually  This is the worst  These are the worst setups ever  Yeah, go along with it  Yeah, I feel bad for the donut ladies  People can't make up their mind  I don't know what it is about buying donuts 
[01:59:30]  But people freak out  They go in there  Okay  Okay, alright  Alright, I want a dozen donuts  And, oh  You have a lot of donuts  Alright, I'm going to start with four chocolate  I want two twisty goose  I want a lemon twirler  I want a honey puff  I want a raspberry crunch  No, two chocolate  No, one  One  Put them back  I want a Bavarian apple crunch  Get the latter  Hey, why don't you go out inside and think it over, huh? 
[02:00:00]  It's a big decision  Can't blow donut day  Yeah  I'm going to edit myself  I feel awkward going into like a five minute  And that is the end of the donut joke  And that's how donut day went  Another day in donut land  I'm just waiting to actually go into a donut place 
[02:00:30]  And just have one donut lady recognize me from that bit  But it hasn't happened  Oh, it hasn't happened?  No, it hasn't happened  That was a special moment  That would be funny  Brian in Sacramento  What's up, Brian?  Hey, Brian Regan  Yeah  Great to talk to you  Thanks  Hey, man  I was watching TV the other day  And I noticed I was watching fishing  You ever watch fishing on TV?  Hey, you know, sometimes I do  Sometimes I do  And it'll make you worry about yourself  I mean, you know, you're sitting there for 15 minutes going 
[02:01:00]  I better get a life  I'm watching fishing  I'm not even fishing  I'm watching fishing  I'm too lazy to fish  I'm taping fishing  To watch again later  And at the end of the fishing show  They roll credits  That's what kills me  There's like 90 people involved  With these two guys fishing  And one of the credits is film editor  This poor guy  He's got to watch all the footage 
[02:01:30]  That's not exciting enough  To make him to that final show  He's got to sit there  No, no  No  No  No  No  No  No  No  No  That's when the mosquito got him  That was  That was an inadvertent lurch  We can't use an inadvertent lurch  One of the credits is writer 
[02:02:00]  I'm not making that up  Look at the end of the fishing show  Writer  What are they writing  Oh  She's a beauty  Zing  Guy's got to worry about his lines  He catches a fish  You have a line  Oh  It's a fish  It's a beauty fish  It's a fish  Fish and a beauty  It's a fish and a beauty fish  It's a fish and a beauty  Beauty  Beauty  Beauty  Fish  Okay  Cut  Cut 
[02:02:30]  You want to work on your line  You want some time in your trailer  To work on your line  Speaking of fishing  Wells  I just like how the  Wells  I like how the writer  On the program  Still uses it  Yeah  Yeah  He hasn't  He hasn't moved on to computers yet  He doesn't have  No word processor  Nothing  Just  Zing  Imagine  Ding  Still banging out a report 
[02:03:00]  On a typewriter like that  Zing  I had to do  I don't know how  I don't  When I went to college  This was before computers  I can't even  I had to write papers and stuff  On regular typewriters  With the white out  And the whole thing  Yeah  What I would give  To have my college years over again  And you could just  Use a word processor  Kids these days  They have no idea  They got it easy  There was the one thing  You'd put under the typewriter too  It was like a pad  You'd push if you made a mistake 
[02:03:30]  And you hit it  And it whites out for you  Oh yeah  I remember that  What was that?  That was modern  Like a little piece of paper  With some white out on it  Yeah yeah yeah  It was just  It was just white out for you  Man  The white out ribbon  They would have on there  Where you hit  Right  Maybe that's what I'm talking about  Yeah  There was three  There was like  Black, red  And then there was  The white out ribbon  Yeah the white out ribbon  You'd hit this weird  Combination of keys  Like you're Emerson Lake  And Palmer  Playing something  And then wham  You hit a letter  And it would white it out  That's what I mean  I think  And they were looking 
[02:04:00]  Just going  Well they can't possibly  Get printing  Any further than this  We've reached the pinnacle  I think we've maxed out  On the technology  We have the white  White out ribbon portion  The white out ribbon  Is as far as  Typing at home  Is ever going to go  And you could never  Really read it  Once it was fixed  Like what  She's a K-U-N-T  What is that  I thought I fixed that  I wanted to spell cheese  Let's say hi to Pete  In Connecticut  Pete what's up 
[02:04:30]  Hey guys  Brian you're the absolute king  I swear to God  I catch your special  Every time it's on  Comedy Central  Thank you  Speaking of fishing  And pregnant women  Have you ever  I mean  The other day  I went up to this friend of mine  Who I thought was pregnant  Oh my gosh  Really embarrassing  Yeah  She wasn't pregnant after all  Oh boy  What an awkward situation  Yeah that happens to me  Sometimes too man  You know you walk up there  And hey when's that baby do  What baby  At the zoo

[02:05:30]  Bye human  Bye person  Nice to meet you  Individual  I had that pregnant thing happen  We were talking on the show  Oh  Well it was kind of similar  Pirates of the Caribbean  The DVD came out  It was the first day  And I kind of liked the movie  I decided to go buy it  And I go up to the counter  And the guy that's working  The register  True story  He had an eye patch on  And I said oh wow  You know you guys are getting 
[02:06:00]  Into it today  Because the movie came out  Oh like he was dressed  Like a pirate  Well he had the patch  Did he have a shirt  And a parrot  Anything else  All I saw was  The eye patch  Seeing eye parrot  You make fun of that too  All I saw was  The eye patch  I'm like oh wow  You guys are really  Getting into the release  Of the movie  You know  He's like excuse me  And that's when I realized  That he probably just  Has one eye  And he's covering up  I was so uncomfortable  I did a corporate gig  One time  Who's booking those  It was some company 
[02:06:30]  A small company  And they had like  The owner who wasn't there  For some reason  Gave like a video presentation  To you know  That was like on the stage  And he had something  Wrong with his eye  And they pixelated  His eye out  I'm not making this up  Are you kidding  And when he would move  The pixelation would move  Over his eye  And no one explained  What was wrong with his eye  I mean what was  Behind that pixelation  You know  I mean if it's worth  Pixelating  Why wouldn't you  Go get a patch 
[02:07:00]  If you need to pixelate  Wow  And you never found out  You didn't ask somebody  No I didn't want to ask  You know  It's like hey  I didn't want to go on stage  And have that be my opening thing  What's the deal  With a guy's eye  Your boss  What was that all about  The guy that's paying me  Yeah  The guy that's signing  My check maybe  Hear that whole audience go  Ooh  You're not allowed  To talk about that  Not the eye  I don't know what  This guy's getting at  We'll try it  Ken what's up  Hey  I'm Brian  I just want to let you know 
[02:07:30]  You're the best  I saw you at the Strand  In Lakewood  A couple months ago  You were killed  Thank you man  Hey man  Hey I'm getting ready  To take my bicycle out  And I'm going to do  Some stunts  And if my nine year old  Paramedic's around  What do you think  You should do  Well  Wow  Well wait  We used to do that  When we were kids man  We would make the  You know  Put the  Do the bike ramp stuff  Out in the street  And we put the cement block  Out in the middle of the road 
[02:08:00]  That's one thing you can do  Because that's where  All the cars are  And you angle some  Wooden plank up to it  And the object is  For one kid  To get on his bike  Ride as fast as he could  And see how high he could go  And that's as far as we planned  It wasn't until the first kid  Was flipping in mid air  What happens now  We don't know  And he'd hit a mailbox  And then you'd have  The nine year old  Paramedics running up  We didn't know what to do  Get some leaves  We did that 
[02:08:30]  He had the easy part though  You know he just had to  Lay there and hurt  The hard part  Was being the kid  Who got sent in first  To tell mom  That's like the hardest part  Growing up  You know because  If you were picked  You'd have to run in  And be strong enough  To let her know  It's important  But not so over the top  To freak her out  Where she couldn't handle it  So you'd run in the house  Hey hey hey  Hey mom hey  Hey how you doing  Just thought I'd run in  At full speed  And you know  To say hello  And oh 
[02:09:00]  You know Kevin  Okay well  You know how like  His right arm  Usually  Usually it bends  Usually it bends  Things like that  It's not bending  Like that  But we know  That you said  You had to go  Get some milk later  So we're thinking  Since you have to go  Anyway  If when you go  If you just might want  To take him to the hospital  And if you get  Peanut butter  Get smooth  Well now they have 
[02:09:30]  The peanut butter  And the jelly  In the jars together  Making it kind of  Easy for you  To  To make the sandwich  That's true  That's a good observation  Thank you  I've noticed that  Thanks  I have to go check that out  Thanks Brian  Is that like in the stores  We had a bird  Get stuck in our house  The other day  Have you ever had that happen  No  Bird flew in the front door  Oh I've had a bat  I've had a few bats  You've had a bat  Oh yeah  Wow 
[02:10:00]  I used to have  When I worked in college  I was a  I was a  What do you call it  Yeah I was a bat  I worked part time  As a bat  I was like Batman  On campus  They needed a superhero  No we had a bird  Get stuck in our house  The other day  Flew in  Couldn't get out  And you know  So it's like horrifying  For everyone  You know you're ducking  But we found ourselves  Actually like  Trying to reason  With the bird  We're like talking  Going 
[02:10:30]  The window's open  In the kitchen  The window's open  In the kitchen  Like he's gonna go  Oh I'm sorry  What did you say  Oh the kitchen  Okay  I didn't understand that  Because I'm a bird  Thank you  Thank you human  Being  I was checking  The foyer  I'll reroute  Myself  Humans are smart  They know  Which windows  Are open  They do turn 
[02:11:00]  Into an idiot  When something  Like that happens  You get a bird  In there  And like you said  You're ducking  Because that thing  When it lands  Somewhere  Everyone's alright  You got like  You're ancient  It's 2004  And you're like  A caveman  With some net  You grab like  The comforter  Off the bed  Or something  And you're gonna  And you turn  Into caveman  It's just a  Hunting thing  It might as well  Be a pterodactyl  In your cave  You just turn  Into this primal thing  And when it takes  And when it takes off  Everyone  Yeah  Yeah 
[02:11:30]  You're all perky  And jerky  Like Ben  We actually  Got beach towels  And like we rolled  Them up  You know how  Like you would  Make rat tails  When you're  Yeah  And we would  Were you snapping  At the little button  Laughing  The bird  Trying to help  Them find the window  Like  My dad's gonna  Do the trick  We're swinging  Beach towels  Oh  Thanks for the  Aerodynamic assistance  I needed that  Little extra  Swoosh  To find that  Kitchen window  You had been 
[02:12:00]  Talking about  I'd fly out of here  But those towels  Are making a hell  Of a wing shear  I can't even  Get off the chair  I was saying  In college  I was a security guard  And I got to  Campus early  And there was  A student  A woman student  Who called from  Her room  Saying there was  A bat in her room  And they called me  I didn't  I'm from Miami  I'd never seen a bat  So I had to go  To her room  And this bat  Was just circling  Like on the top  Of the ceiling  And she wanted me  To get rid of the bat 
[02:12:30]  And I said  What am I going to do  You know  So she had a tennis racket  She was in the tennis  So I grabbed her  Tennis racket  And I just kept  Swinging at this thing  And I ended up  Killing the thing  With the tennis racket  It was like  Oh man  It was a horrible thing  Wow  That really sticks with you  Is that bad  Oh yeah  I haven't slept since  I just can't picture  Brian Regan  Taking a life  Even out of a bat  Man it made me feel good  I laughed maniacally  When it was  When it was wriggling  In it's final  Gasps of breath 
[02:13:00]  Zachary from Delaware  What's up Zachary  Hey how you guys doing  Pretty good  We're hanging with  Brian Regan  He's at Caroline's  All weekend long  Here in New York City  Awesome  Did he fly into town  And were there any delays  There was about  A 30 minute delay  And it left the gate  On time  And then just sat there  For about a half hour  And the captain  Finally gets on  After a half hour  Folks  Let me tell you 
[02:13:30]  What's going on up here  Oh  Oh I hope it's good  Is that ever followed  With anything  Even remotely good  Let me tell you  What's going on up here  Folks  We found a big bag  Of money on board  And  No one has claimed it  So the tower  Has instructed us  To divvy it  Amongst all you passengers  Apologize for the delay  The problem is  There's over  Seven million dollars  In cash 
[02:14:00]  And what we're  Running into  Each individual stack  Is getting so high  They keep toppling over  Can't apologize  Enough folks  From the flight deck  Our apologies  It's never that  It's always  Somebody put our engine  In upside down  And  There's only one tool  In our galaxy  That can fix this  And  It's in Madagascar  The tower 
[02:14:30]  Has instructed us  To go to a holding area  And remain there  Until an on board  Dies a natural death  Why do they always  Listen to the tower  I've never understood that  They never question  The authority of the tower  Well the tower  Is telling us to hold here  Well what do you think  What do you think  Captain  About what the tower  Is telling us  Wouldn't once  You just want to hear them go  The tower is telling us  To hold  But  You might notice 
[02:15:00]  I'm rumbling  Along the grass  You look out the right  You'll see all those aircraft  Lined up on the runway  The tower keeps telling us  We're number 19  For take off  I say we're number one  What's the tower  Going to do  Why I ought to  You never should have  Run that  You're right  I shouldn't have  I should have  Listened better  If you need me  I'll be up in the clouds  That's hilarious 
[02:15:30]  Oh that is funny  Hey what time  We have to get you out of here  I mean we'd have you all morning  But someone was telling me  You have to be out of here soon  No  About 8.30  Oh good  He's got other things to do  And you know we don't have to break  We just  That's right  It's weird  We've been hanging out  For 40 minutes already  We just hang  It's a hang Brian  What do you do  Like after you do some morning radio  And then you take a little nappy  Before  I go to the  I do charity work 
[02:16:00]  You do charity work  Quickly  Yeah  Yeah  Jim and I  We go over to the soup kitchens  And ladle out the soup  That's nice  Around the holidays  Are there really such places  Soup kitchens  I've never been to one  No  I was wondering about that  What we should do for Brian  Is play Norton's mom's phone call  I would love that  Get Brian Regan's take on this  Because Brian is  Probably the polar opposite  Of our fine Jim Norton here  Married, children  Responsible  Adult  No I don't mean 
[02:16:30]  Well yeah he is great  But his personal life  Is a little different  Than yours Brian  Oh personal life  Oh yeah  Norton talks about  Hookers a lot  On this show  Yeah  The ladies of the evening  If you will  And  Love of them  And hate of them  At the same time  Simultaneous  Yeah  Spends a lot of money  On this hobby  And  Well  I guess it was about  Two weeks ago now  Jim  Came in here  And told us all  That he wants to  Swear off hookers  Brian  Alright  He wants to  Turn over a new leaf  He wants to  Try to find a lady 
[02:17:00]  Maybe have a couple  Kids like yourself  Maybe move out  To Vegas  And start a nice  Little home life  For him  Good luck  With that quest  Thanks  He lasted four days  By the way  Keep it dragging  It's already over with  I'm starting again  I'm on like two days now  Yeah he's starting again  He's up to two days  So it's good right  I want to buy a place  I'm just dumping my money  In the process  And it's sickening  So um  Brian  Jim's mom called  Jim and left a message  And of course  Now Jim doing radio  Full time with us  Decided this would be  Great for the radio 
[02:17:30]  And he brought in  The phone call from his mom  Would you like to hear it  Sure  Not quite a call  You would get  From your mom  Yeah I don't think  You've ever gotten a call  Like this from your mom  Brian  Well let me see  Alright let's take a listen here  Hi sweetheart  It's mom  How are you  Jimmy I know  This is a little awkward  But everyone's fine here  But we heard the radio show  We love it by the way  And you were talking about  Giving up  You know  Ladies of the evening  Um  Which is a wonderful thing  But you know what  Dr. Phil always says 
[02:18:00]  Replace something  With something  So I was thinking  You know  You have that nice  Gym downstairs  And you know  Just for like  20 minutes  To a half an hour  And you would feel better  Use that  And also  There's gyms in New York  You could go  You could exercise  And you would feel  A whole lot better  You'd lose a little weight  You'd tone up  And you relieve  You know  Tension and stuff  And you'd be meeting  Other people  I don't know honey  I just thought  It might be a good thing  I'm sorry  I'm interfering  I know 
[02:18:30]  I just  I'm thinking of you  Nobody knows I'm calling  So uh  Don't get offended  Or think I'm strange  But I am a mother  And I worry about you  You're doing so well  Everything's falling into place  This might be just one of the  You know  The health thing  It would help  It would help you  Sweetheart  Well anyway  That's it  I'm not going to go on  I know it's not my business  But anyway  I love you  And I feel I can  Interfix if I'm your mother  I'm taking a special license  But anyway  We're looking forward  To seeing you at Christmas  I really hope you can make it 
[02:19:00]  And uh  Anyway  Don't be mad at me  Okay sweetie  I love you  Talk to you soon  Bye bye  There you go Brian  That was actually very nice  You could feel the love  Coming through  Yeah  She loves you very much  That's what I got out of that  Ladies of the evening  Ladies of the evening  Dr. Phil  You know  And she's telling me  She's like  You know you could tone up a little  She's like  Look I've seen you  I understand why you have to pay  Stupid  But for financial reasons  Do a crunch  She figures  She's giving advice anyway  She might as well hit a few different topics  I'm not saying you're wrong to get whores 
[02:19:30]  Yeah you know what else  I guess I just picked up this time around  It was the fact that  No it's not only getting rid of the whores  The ladies of the evening  And working out  And relieving the tension  But meeting new people  At the gym  Yeah  I kind of  I just picked up on that one  Maybe she wants you to meet some new people  Your future girlfriend could be on a Stairmaster right now  Yeah  That's what she's saying  You could go meet some people  And release some tension  You're going to meet down at the gym  Stop being a filthy embarrassment to the entire family 
[02:20:00]  I just can't picture you in the gym  Like hi  My name's Jimmy  You are  How is Christmas going to be  After this phone call  It's going to be a lot of  A lot of avoided eye contact  So you just keep looking at the plate of food  Man this is good  You just keep cutting  More ham  More ham  Man oh man  I can't even pick my head up from this  Hungry enough to eat a whore  So Brian I don't think you've ever had a phone call like that from mom huh 
[02:20:30]  No I haven't but you know  But god bless  It's nice though  You could feel like you know  She cares a lot about Jimmy  But you know what  They could have gone the other direction  Where she was like all angry and upset  I mean it was like  It was cool  Or she could have encouraged me to get more  Like look don't listen to them  You got to pay to get it sucked  Who cares  Who's looking  If you need any extra money  I'll chip in for you 
[02:21:00]  What do you think your father does when I'm tired  They're all natural and normal  There's no need to feel awkward about it  Right  They're listening  Brian's going to be at Caroline's all weekend long  I've just been told that only Sunday is available  The 8 o'clock show Sunday still available for tickets  212-757-4100  Someone's asking about your website Brian  Do you have one or  Yes I have a  I have a website  Is it  A web address  It's just my name  BrianRegan.com  Alright  R-E-G-A-N right 
[02:21:30]  R-E-G-A-N  And when are you going to put out another CD  That CD that you had out  Brilliant  Well thank you  Thank you  You didn't make any money off it  Because who makes money off  Commie CDs these days  But that actually worked out okay  I have a DVD coming out very soon  Oh look at you  A DVD  Yes  I don't know what that means  To show off how handsome you are  It's a technical term for a video  Everyone's going to see how handsome he is Anthony 
[02:22:00]  Yes  Yeah well that's basically the whole point of it  You know  I mean the material is almost like secondary  It's just so people can take a look at  You know how I look  And you know I'm into the grooming  Sure  You can tell  Are you a metrosexual  I don't know what that means  But  It's guys that like to  You know  Keep everything neat and orderly  But they're not gay  Oh okay  Well  Straight guys with gay fashion sensibilities 
[02:22:30]  It's not even  It's like guys who are really neat  And coiffed properly  No I don't have that  Go get facials and manicures  Absolutely  Yeah  Go visit a sick friend  You know  Even that  Caring deeply about friends and stuff  We're getting a lot of instant feedback from Brian  Mike from Jersey writes  Hey Brian there was a big lottery drawing recently  And I was watching a news reporter  Covering the line of people waiting to buy a lottery ticket  Have you ever seen this happen while watching the news? 
[02:23:00]  Wow  Your listeners have some very pointed questions  Yes  Yeah  It kills me  The lottery jackpot story on the news  It's the biggest nothing story  And they cover it every time  Whenever the jackpot gets high  They always send some new reporter down  Where they sell tickets  So he can show you how long the line is  There's some cutting edge journalism  There's nothing to say  You have the two in the newsroom  We have a $180 million jackpot  We have our correspondent Hank Edwards standing by 
[02:23:30]  Down at the ticket line  Hank what's going on down there?  We have a long line  There are a lot of people standing in it  They want to win the lotto  Back to you  Describe the action down there Hank  It's single file  And they're all facing that way  Because the cashier is over there  So they're facing the way they're going 
[02:24:00]  I think they'd feel awkward  If they were facing in a backward type of fashion  And stepping up awkwardly  In a backward way  So what they're doing is  They're looking at the back of the head  Of the person in front of them  And if this one steps up  This one fills in the gap  It's like a pattern I'm noticing  That's a great report Hank  Ask them some questions  Do you want to win or lose?  I've heard them ask that  People in line 
[02:24:30]  Would you like to win the lottery?  No  But there's a gentleman  A few behind me  Who mentioned he might want to win  You know what kills me about the lotteries  When a  I don't know what it is about  A lottery jackpot  I'd defy you to tell anyone  About a huge lottery jackpot  Without them having to explain  The taxes involved  What is it about that? 
[02:25:00]  Hey did you hear there was a  $380 million  Yeah but taxes  You know pay taxes on that  Yeah yeah I understand that  But it's still good isn't it?  Yeah but you know  Like half that goes to taxes  Yeah I know  But then they still have like  $150 million  Yeah but  They pay a lot of taxes  Right  Okay  So it's bad  It's bad  There's always a buzz killer  A buzz killer  I think we have time  For one more call  Chad in Brooklyn  Chad what's up buddy? 
[02:25:30]  I'm sorry  I missed where  Brian was going to be  Caroline's  Oh  See it's stupid for me  To call up to ask  I would have wrote it  Over the internet  But my computer's been acting up  Sometimes it has a mind  Of its own  You know what I mean Brian?  What is that?  That could be the worst  Set up ever  Awful  I thought I was bad  What you said out  I know what you mean  Yeah?  Yeah  I have an old computer myself  I gotta get a new one  My  I've got an old one 
[02:26:00]  It's made out of wood  Got a nice oak finish on it  No  They've made like advances  This is similar to the typewriter thing  You know  Yeah  I have this computer  But my friend let me work on his  He's got a new one  His anticipates what you're writing  I had never seen that  I just write on his  M-O-N  And the screen pops up  Monday?  Uh  Wow  Yeah  Monday  F-E-B  February?  Write again  Kimo Sabe  And then this thing pops up 
[02:26:30]  It looks like you're trying to write a letter  Do you need help?  Yeah  Write the damn thing  Then I go home to work on mine  Mine tries  It's just not very bright I guess  You know  I write M-O-N  Mongoose  No  Monday  F-E-B  Febreze fabric freshener  February  It looks like you're trying to write the Magna Carta  Do you need help? 
[02:27:00]  Your computer's stupid, huh?  Stupid in school  My computer has the white ribbon in it  It still has the ribbon  Yeah, the white erasure  Comes up across the monitor  Alright, I think we have to get Brian out of here  Yeah  When are you going to come back and see us again, Brian?  Soon  Yeah  Yeah, man  Alright  It's nice to get that closure, Opie  This has been closure  Yeah, definitely 
[02:27:30]  This is our last guest  Right before we got fired  Did you know that we were just so done after that show?  It became that international story after you left  I was on my way to the studio  And my manager called and said  I should probably just give you a little heads up  What's going on, you know?  A little heads up  A little heads up  It's almost like  You might see a lot of cameras outside the studio  It's almost like calling somebody on a cell phone  When they're laying on their back  Going to that big circular saw  Yeah  Hey, there's a little heads up  There's a buzz saw about three feet from your head 
[02:28:00]  So I was like  Oh, okay, wow  You know, so he told me the deal  But you guys have been, you know, so great to me over the years  So I came in  And I knew it was a little awkward  But I didn't realize what the ramifications were  He could sense when we were both walking out with the box  With our nameplate and pictures of the family  And our desk blotter  I had a wilted plant in mind  A wilted plant, yeah  And a Ziggy cartoon  That might have given it away, Brian 
[02:28:30]  It was like the typical scene of the guy getting fired  From like a Twilight Zone episode  He's got the big box  Back up your desk, you're fired  How'd you find out?  It was the next week  Did you find out from CNN, Fox News Channel?  No, my manager called me  Because you guys, that was a Friday  Yeah, exactly  And then Monday  Monday we were still  You weren't on live  You played a repeat  Yeah, they were playing a repeat of some winter show 
[02:29:00]  Remember that?  Yeah, right  We were talking about the snow outside  We were talking about some really wholesome holiday  Oh, winter  They were trying to find  Winter show  They were trying to find clean versions of our show  Like completely  And I'm not even talking just clean SEC stuff  They wanted nothing  Because they knew everyone was listening  The entire press junket out there  Was listening and taping the show  So they didn't want the show to offend anyone  I think we had maybe two hours of material  After six years of clean material 
[02:29:30]  We had to find 20 Brian Regan  Yeah, I think you were on that  That week a lot  Yeah  It was the Brian Regan marathon  Yeah  Well, that was Monday  And then Tuesday they did another repeat  And I think it was Wednesday or Thursday  Yeah  That next week  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  You know  My manager called  I don't know  These guys are  Are done  Are going away for a while  Done  A long while  Over two years  Anthony Michael Hall  Anthony Michael Hall blew us off that day  Yep  He was supposed to be on the show with you that day 
[02:30:00]  But he didn't want to be part of the controversy  Never happens with Brian though  Something like that  Where, you know  We'll get calls and go  Yeah, you hear Brian isn't going to be  Allowed to do any stand-up for two years  Because of what he did on stage last night  This would never, ever happen  Well, we'll see tonight  We'll switch things up  Yeah, let's see what you get going tonight  The Kellogg's people were upset  We're all going to the show, by the way  It caused a big controversy  We'll be at the 8 o'clock show tonight  That caller earlier had mentioned 
[02:30:30]  There's like a C, a C word  Yeah  Yeah, the C word  So I'm going to find out what that is  Yeah  And, you know  I'll probably just close my show with it tonight  Start peppering it through your act  Yeah  It would be funny if I just threw that  Like into every sentence  And like never referred to why all of a sudden  Yeah  I'm horrific  The horrified people  The looks on the people's faces  Your cutest bit  You know  People bringing their grandmothers out  Hey, what is with these effing Pop-Tarts  These stupid old ladies  C's 
[02:31:00]  What a bunch of C's they are  Hey, what's the baby do, C?  You know, these donut ladies  What a bunch of C's they are  C doesn't seem to have the same effect  Just saying the letter  You're a twisty goo, you see  Don't you hate the fishing shows  All the fish smell like seas  And just dropped jaws everywhere  As Brian hits the pedal 
[02:31:30]  At the base of the microphone  To get a laugh  Yeah, just to cover up the horrifying  Whoa  What?  You know, sometimes you'll listen to a radio show  And you know how they  You can't have a  You know, on satellite you can  But on regular radio  You can't have like a four letter word, right?  Yeah  But for some reason  They can have the first consonant sound  And the last  The first sound and the last sound  Yeah  Even in a one syllable word  Yeah  So like the C word  You'll hear the C and the T  But they'll bleep out the offensive UN part 
[02:32:00]  Right  Yeah  So there's  What?  Well, I'm glad I didn't hear the UN  Because the UN  That's the part  That's the part that just  That is so offensive  The UN part of that word  I like when they bleep it too in the middle  So you hear like the F word  And it comes out  FOOK  It's pretty much it being sung  It's just like, you know  Shit and FOOK 
[02:32:30]  And  Same thing  I don't think it leaves much to the imagination  No, no  We might as well play the F lesson  Oh  Going into break here  But first  Someone wants to thank Brian for stopping by  John in Philly  What's up, John?  Hey, Brian's definitely made the show worth of six cents today  I was just wanting to thank him  Yeah, we figured out  It's like six to seven cents a day to listen to this program  When people are trying to figure out  If they're going to pay for that $2 a month  It breaks down to seven cents a day  For the cost of three pieces of bazooka bubble gum  You can listen to the Opie and Anthony show 
[02:33:00]  I can't wait to see tonight  Because I want to see what it looks like when he says  It's a sea of dirt  Oh, gosh  All right, Brian  We want to thank you for coming in  Thank you, guys  It's always a pleasure  Caroline's  Only the 8 o'clock show on Sunday is still available  Call Caroline's right now  212-757-4100  And we'll see you tonight at the first show  The Sunday show is going to be my winter show  I'm getting some ideas  From the winter show they broadcast  Very good  We can maybe get a couple to have sex right on the stage for you  If you'd like  We can assist the show a little bit for you 
[02:33:30]  Doing your act and stepping over naked bodies  I'm open to ideas  All right  All right, thanks, guys  As we go to break, it's the F lesson  Perhaps one of the most interesting words in the English language today  Is the word fuck  Out of all of the English words that begin with the letter F  Fuck is the only word that is referred to as the F word 
[02:34:00]  It's the one magical word  Just by its sound can describe pain, pleasure, hate, and love  Fuck, as most words in the English language, is derived from German  The word fricken, which means to strike  In English, fuck falls into many grammatical categories  As a transitive verb, for instance  John fucked Shirley  As an intransitive verb  Shirley fucks  Its meaning's not always sexual 
[02:34:30]  It can be used as an adjective, such as  John's doing all the fucking work  As part of an adverb  Shirley talks too fucking much  As an adverb enhancing an adjective  Shirley is fucking beautiful  As a noun  I don't give a fuck  As part of a word  Abso-fucking-lutely  Or  In-fucking-credible  And  As almost every word in a sentence  Fuck the fucking fuckers 
[02:35:00]  As you must realize  There aren't too many words with the versatility of fuck  As in these examples  Describing situations such as  Fraud  I got fucked at the used car lot  Dismay  Aw, fuck it  Trouble  I guess I'm really fucked now  Aggression  Don't fuck with me, buddy  Difficulty  I don't understand this fucking question  Inquiry  Who the fuck was that? 
[02:35:30]  Dissatisfaction  I don't like what the fuck is going on here  Incompetence  He's a fuck-off  Dismissal  Why don't you go outside  And play hide  And go fuck yourself  I'm sure you can think of many more examples  With all of these multi-purpose applications  How can anyone be offended  When you use the word?  We say  Use this unique, flexible word  More often than your daily speech  It will identify the quality of your character immediately 
[02:36:00]  Say it loudly  And proudly  Fuck you  What kind of a show are you guys putting on here today?  Cancel all appointments  Welcome to Radio Free America  America's ready  I'm ready  I want a million voices crying out in the wilderness  Jesus, let's get serious  Now, take a deep cleansing breath  And begin  Fix it, fix it

The rest of the year.  And we need some kind of cliffhanger.  Before this show ends at 10 today, we need some kind of cliffhanger which will force the people that are kind of on the fence like,  Eh, I don't really have the virus yet.  I'm kind of itchy and stuff, but I don't really have the virus.  But I got to know what's going to happen.  It might be the thing that makes them, yeah, continue Monday. 
[02:43:30]  What's wrong?  It was nothing bad.  It was actually funny.  We have Brian in the other studio cutting some IDs for us.  Brian Regan.  Oh, Regan was...  Did you eat?  Yeah, no, I'm just kidding.  How's your Pop-Tart?  There's a call back to yesterday.  What?  How's your Pop-Tart?  It was all right.  Looks yummy laying there.  You want it?  Sure do.  Not all of them.  Try to eat better.  Yeah.  As you order your coffee with low fat and one sugar.  There you go.  You should have seen him last night.  Oh, you did. 
[02:44:00]  That's right.  Opie was there.  At dinner.  Don't you remember?  With his dessert.  Mm-hmm.  I love dessert.  He had this huge bowl of chocolate ice cream on it.  Mom's mixing bowl, it's called.  With chocolate ice cream.  In it.  Chocolate brownies.  Brownies in it.  Chocolate brownies and chocolate ice cream over top.  And whipped cream.  It could have fed the whole table.  And whipped cream.  It was a huge mixing bowl.  I had two bites.  It could have fed the whole table of four.  How many people were there?  Four, I guess.  But no, he ate the whole thing.  He ate the whole thing. 
[02:44:30]  And it had a huge wooden mixing spoon with it.  It was a mixing bowl.  And the whole gimmick is, it's Mom's mixing bowl.  It came with a huge wooden mixing spoon.  And that's what he ate with.  Yeah, but I'm toning up and I'm looking good.  He had all chocolate around his mouth.  Mm.  This good.  I know.  Yeah.  Looked like I kissed Ben on the asshole after the flu.  He didn't have the flu.  He had the shits.  Okay.  Ben's very excited for what Eric's about to say.  What up, man?  What up?  So let's all stare at Eric and... 
[02:45:00]  Funny story, Ben?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  No?  Hilarious.  Is this funny?  It was amusing at the time, yes.  Is it amusing or funny?  It was funny.  It's a funny story.  It was funny.  All right.  Funny story.  So we get...  Hold on, kids.  Here comes a funny story from Eric.  Strap in.  Pull over.  Put on your laughing hat.  Better known as Sex Bagel, but we're going to change the name of Sex Bagel.  Yes, please.  When he does something stupid, we'll figure it out.  Go ahead.  Like now.  So here we go.  All right.  So we have Mr. Regan in the studio.  He's recording the liners, and he's obsessed with Steve's shirt, right? 
[02:45:30]  And he goes, wow, you got a whole motif going on here.  And he picks up his little drinking cup.  He goes, I've never seen a cup come with a shirt before.  And he's just like pulling on Steve's shirt and everything.  It was funny.  Yeah.  See?  I knew that.  Hello?  Hello?  Is this thing on?  Hello?  Wow.  By the way, you know, when you're telling these little stories, here's a good idea.  Have a point.  It makes it so much more interesting for the listener.  You're just a tool.  When are people going to learn?  You never preface anything by saying I got something really funny. 
[02:46:00]  I don't even understand what...  Because even if it's funny, it's not funny anymore.  You got a whole motif.  He held up the cup and said, what?  I didn't know you got a free cup.  He thought it was...  Does he have a flame cup?  Yes, Steve has a flame cup.  It has to be explained that the cup was also a flame cup.  Oh, you haven't seen Steve's flame cup?  No.  I've seen it, and he butchered it so badly.  That's how you knew Eric was just on a road to a good bomb?  Because he actually put his hand up like he was holding a cup. 
[02:46:30]  Right.  He was doing a visual gag for the radio.  See, I had no idea what he was talking about.  The cup.  Perhaps explaining to the listeners that the cup did have flames on it, too.  Steve's whole studio is flaming.  It's the flaming studio.  Right.  All right.  When did this flaming thing start?  I don't know.  Do you remember this?  We've been working with...  We've been working with Steve for five years now?  That's been a while.  We were in Boston once, walking down Newberry Street, and one of the shops had flaming boots. 
[02:47:00]  Austin Beat.  Yeah.  And he walked in there like, wow, these are really cool.  And we were goofing on him then.  And this was years ago.  And it's only gotten worse, his flame habit.  Now he loves it.  Everything.  You see how pissed he was over that he left some at the hotel in Cleveland?  Yeah.  He's all upset about that.  I saw that on the news.  Well, maybe if he didn't show it up, spraying their hoses in the closet thinking it had burst  into flames.  Some crack addict was holding like a spoon with cocaine in it over one of his shirts. 
[02:47:30]  Maybe if he didn't drink so much in Cleveland, he would have remembered everything.  Did he drink so much, did he?  Two tenses in one sentence?  Drinks.  Maybe if he didn't drink so much.  Maybe if he didn't drink.  Maybe he was just talking like, maybe if he didn't drink so much.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Thank you.  Thank you, Anthony.  Sure.  All right.  Anthony knows I helped him out today, so he's helping his old pal back.  Any assistance?  Thank you, Ant.  Yeah.  I was doing a little impression there.  You can spoke any way you want.  I was acting like a darkie.  Jesus.  Oh, like they don't say, I got my hair did. 
[02:48:00]  I got my her did.  See?  That's what I was doing.  Get out the core.  Get out the motherfucking core.  Did you ever see a soldier story?  Hmm?  Did you ever see a soldier story?  Oh, yeah.  That's great, right?  Isn't that the one with, hey, Gitchy?  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah, with, uh...  How's it going?  Benzo Washington and, uh...  Yeah.  Fantastic.  Hey, do we have an update from Noah?  Are you still banging Candy, the porn star?  Oh!  She's probably back in Cleveland.  I'm hearing, uh... 
[02:48:30]  I'm hearing that there may be an update, and this is kind of a soap opera, the Opie and  Anthony show.  I guess if, uh, you're just tuning in the program, well, God, we're seeing the numbers.  A lot of people tuning in every day, Anthony.  Mm-hmm.  So maybe a lot of people don't know that...  Wow.  Are these the latest pictures from Candy?  Yeah.  Yeah, she's got some new sites up at LADirectModels.com.  Wow.  I'm giving her a plug.  You are giving her a plug, aren't you?  I'm allowed.  Not the first time.  You banged this.  Yeah.  For free.  Very nice.  Thanks, Jimmy. 
[02:49:00]  Very impressive.  This is the same girl that was in the studio?  Let's take a look.  Mm-hmm.  Let's take a little look.  Let's see.  I don't think she photographs as well as she looks in person.  Totally nude.  Totally nude.  Wow.  Yeah, that's...  How old is she?  Oh, hello.  There's a fine how do you do.  Well, we saw that how do you do, uh...  Yeah.  During cherry darts.  Right.  From the back.  How old is she again?  20?  20.  Yeah.  Yeah, 20.  Candy is a porn star.  She's new to the business and only been known in a short period of time.  And, uh...  She's from Cleveland and she came and did some stuff for the radio show.  That's lovely.  Look what you would have had to pay for, Jimmy. 
[02:49:30]  Nope.  I ain't looking.  Oh, he's not looking.  And, um...  Jimmy took a liking to her.  Mm-hmm.  She's a very lovely girl.  We don't really dig the porn stars usually.  Yeah.  But this one is, uh, fresh off the boat.  We like them when they're brand new porn stars.  And she looks pretty good.  She looks really good, actually.  And, uh...  Jim was, uh...  I think it's safe to say you were hoping you could spend some time with her.  Yes.  You went for the freebie?  No, never went for the freebie.  No.  We had her grabbing your junk on the air.  But I even told you that that was like...  I'm like, no.  I'm like...  I'm not deluded as to what that is. 
[02:50:00]  But she grabbed your mule and she turned, uh...  Kind of red.  She was really into it.  Nice one.  I think you were hoping that perhaps after the show you could say,  hey, you want to grab a cup of coffee or something?  No, I kind of knew.  No, I'll tell you why.  Because when she first came in, the story got brought up by how I like to spend a lot of money.  She's like, what about me?  And I knew immediately that was her place.  Oh, that was just about the past.  No, no.  I was never deluded about that.  That's fine.  All right.  I just didn't like the price she quoted me.  Yeah, that was a little steep.  The only thing that annoyed me.  The only thing that annoyed me.  Yeah.  If...  Yeah, Jim would have to spend, what, $1,000 to sleep with Candy. 
[02:50:30]  The porn star.  Oh, gee.  Near the end of the show, Candy decided that Noah, our intern here, was really cute.  She had a thing for Noah, the intern.  Yes.  No offense, Noah, but, you know, that's your title, the intern.  He's a huge comic that was on Jay Leno.  Oh, yeah.  Tonight Show.  It was on the Tonight Show.  And you're an intern, technically, okay?  And Jim thought, you know, he could spend some time with Candy and...  Spend some money on Candy.  Spend some money on Candy. 
[02:51:00]  And it was going to cost you $1,000.  And then she said she cut you a price of $500, right?  Which I thought was very reasonable.  And as you're trying to negotiate this, Noah, the intern's banging her for free.  Yeah.  That just shows you.  But it does go to prove being funny is worthless on every level.  It really is.  I'm telling you, it is of no value.  You get girls that want to be your friend.  Ugh, exactly.  That's what you get by being funny.  A bunch of fatzos that like me.  Yeah.  Make me laugh.  Ugh.  Fag hags that kind of also like funny guys. 
[02:51:30]  Yep.  That's pretty much it.  So Noah brought Candy back to Hoboken and banged her all weekend long.  Although, however, had I known that, I actually would have spent the $500 if I knew she was  going right back after, just for a hummer, and I would have left some honor.  Leave a little...  Yeah.  Leave a little Jimmy honor for the trip back.  We can dream.  Maybe someday.  Like, you know, perhaps, and this isn't out of the question, perhaps she was doing this  to get free kind of room while she worked in New York, because she was going to jobs 
[02:52:00]  when she was staying with you.  Yeah, that was the best part about it.  In between banging Noah, she was going on real jobs.  You know, the cell phone rings.  She goes, oh, I gotta go.  She's gone for an hour, you know, a couple hours.  She comes back.  She was taking care of another guy.  And then she comes back to Noah's house.  How many times did you bang her in the weekend?  Yeah, like six.  But she had to cross the river every time.  And she came back like two or three times, so the theory doesn't really hold up there.  No?  No, she had a hotel room and everything, so it's kind of a hassle to cross the river.  She did have a hotel room? 
[02:52:30]  Yeah, she told us she had a hotel room.  That's what I was just...  I wanted a little...  She just liked Noah.  I wanted to clear it out.  Oh, why wouldn't she?  I absolutely...  What's so hard to believe?  I'll tell you what's so hard...  I looked like you walked off the set of Smallville.  But she's a porn star.  Yeah?  I have this...  But she's a young porn star, not quite jaded.  I just don't think porn stars in general like people in that way.  I don't think she's been abused enough.  Like, she knows how to separate the sex.  Like, she was really into the sex with Noah, and then she was doing the sex on the side 
[02:53:00]  to make some extra cash.  And that was a little bizarre to me.  Not jaded enough yet.  Right.  So, are you guys keeping in touch, though?  Yeah, we keep in touch.  She sends me little text messages that are just nasty.  Pretty much amount to phone sex.  Really?  Very nice.  Oh, yeah.  Text sex.  Top...  Yeah, this pocket.  What does she say on the phone?  You know, you'll...  I'm not nervous about it.  I'll show it to you.  They're nasty.  They're just brutal.  Do you like it, though?  Yeah.  I got a little cold, though, over the week.  That's why I was out on Wednesday. 
[02:53:30]  Oh, that's the...  Oh, boy.  Oh, oh.  You sure it's the cold?  No, if that's the only thing I walk away from last weekend, I think I win.  That little thing where you're standing over the toilet, your dick sneezes green stuff?  That's next.  It always starts with a little cold.  Oh, a little...  Oh, just a little sniffle.  My throat's a little scratchy.  Tell me you weren't thinking, like, uh-oh.  I must be coming down with something.  Yeah.  You know...  What's the incubation period?  Right.  No, you stand in front of the mirror for a couple hours, examining every little bump.  And you're like...  See?  Is that...  That's not what I think it is, is it? 
[02:54:00]  It starts with a little cold, and then you're wondering, wow, what was this girl about after  all?  She's getting tested this week.  And she's gonna...  To do some work.  ...give you the news?  Oh, jeez.  All right.  Are you a little nervous?  It's not yours?  No, no, no.  Are you a little nervous about this, Noah?  Uh...  I mean, her test is coming in, and...  Wait.  That's not age.  There's no age.  It wouldn't be that fast.  It doesn't work that fast.  Wait.  No.  Can you tell?  Does it take, like, a while to show up?  It takes about 10 years.  Well, no.  I mean, like, to show up in a test if you do a blood... 
[02:54:30]  The HIV thing, not the HIV thing.  Look at it.  He's asking questions.  Oh.  I don't know.  I don't know.  What stupid thing did you do, assuming it was okay?  Oral sex?  Yeah.  Well, some of that.  Yeah, it's immoral, right?  Yeah.  And without a condom.  Without a dental dam.  Dental dam.  Those are romantic.  Oh, that's horrible.  Who the hell has ever used one of those?  No one.  Get in there and mix it up.  Right.  It's just a little spit and fluid.  All right.  We're looking at Noah's phone for the text messages from Candy, the porn star from Cleveland. 
[02:55:00]  Yeah, I'm going to give you...  Oh, he's laughing.  Oh, good one.  Yeah.  Starting from this one, 15, to all these that are locked.  All the 15 and...  I'm saving them.  I'm awful.  Yeah.  No, you should save them.  Are you kidding me?  Very romantic.  Go to thanks now.  What do you do?  Hit okay?  Yeah, that's one and up.  Thanks now.  The rest of my day will be filled with thoughts of you, wet and soapy.  No, that's never mind.  Water running down your body, dripping onto so many places I'd like to be touching. 
[02:55:30]  Damn you.  Wait, did you shower in front of her or something?  I think it came up in conversation.  All right.  How do I go to the...  Do I get that back out and go to the next...  Go to 14?  Bill O'Reilly, like to attack you with a loofah, Noah.  A loofah in the shower.  I want to read all these because it'll drive Norton nuts.  No, it won't.  Yes, it will.  A little bit.  Who are you kidding?  Your dick filling my mouth.  I start slowly, then wrap my lips a bit, tighter, sucking on her, allowing you to slide into my mouth deep and quickly over and over again. 
[02:56:00]  Are you reading something or just talking to Noah?  You're still searching the text?  Oh, you want me to read?  Okay.  You tense slightly and arch your back, grabbing my wet hair, forcing...  Bill O'Reilly.  ...forcing yourself deeper down my throat.  You moan loudly that you want to come in my mouth. 
[02:56:30]  Oh, that's nice.  All right.  That's nice.  And it continues.  You're a bit weak, shaky even, but I don't stop.  I suck vigorously.  You scream lightly, letting yourself explode in my mouth.  I swallow sucking greedily, wanting more.  Opie?  Please isolate some of this.  Please.  It is the...  Just want to remind you, we are in the free play week.  Oh.  Yeah, but they said just no live sex acts. 
[02:57:00]  I want you inside of me, thrusting deep, making me so moist, you slid in with such ease.  My warm wet...  This wasn't such a good idea.  My graphic depictions.  Oh, really?  I would think.  Constricting you to stay inside, taunting you to F me harder.  I think we found our cliffhanger.  If you want to hear the rest of Noah the Intern's text messages, make sure you sign up for the  channel and continue listening on Monday. 
[02:57:30]  When it culminates in some...  There's another...  Sticky mess.  There's another ten.  I love the way you make me scream.  We can say that, right?  That can mean anything.  All caps.  Anything.  Is there...  Are there any messages about balloon, not action?  All right, wait.  Something's going on here, because now she just writes, not too shabby.  You're getting better at this.  So you're writing back to her.  I gave it a shot.  I'm awful at that sort of thing.  Uh-oh.  You tried talking dirty over the text message to her.  And she's being polite here.  I think I erased it.  I'm not even giving you that part.  She says, not too shabby.  You're getting better at this.  What did you...  Come on.  What did you say?  It was some...  It was a worthless shot. 
[02:58:00]  I think it was something about oral sex.  I gave it a try.  You spill my coffee, and I pour hot coffee on your tits.  No?  I've never been good at that whole thing.  Come on.  What did you say?  Cyber thing.  It was something about, like, a leaky member in places that they don't belong.  That's good.  We're cleaning it up for you people.  No, what did you say?  Say it.  It's cool.  I'll search for it.  It's probably in my outbox.  I'm actually quite worked up now.  A bit wet, to say the least.  And no panties is making public masturbation possible. 
[02:58:30]  All right.  My fingers are inside my...  All right.  Well, hey.  Let him find the outbox.  He's still got it on the...  Yeah, I want to see what he was writing.  I'm really going to nail myself to the cross.  His volley back.  Because this is awful.  How'd you like it in your shitter?  Your turn.  All right, all right, all right, all right, all right.  Are you ready for this, you sons of bitches?  I would kneel over you as you lay on your back, running my dick over your lips and down 
[02:59:00]  your breasts, dripping all over your swollen pussy.  Dripping?  Dripping.  That means you're like a little boy.  A little bit of...  It means you have gonorrhea.  Yeah.  Like a laugh.  She liked it.  Okay.  I make a doctor's appointment for my drippy member.  They say I was good.  I'm not a novelist.  I'll squeeze my cock over your face like a glue gun.  And if you need me talking in the tub, just squeeze it against the...  Well, the relationship continues. 
[02:59:30]  I know I'm not...  Noah the intern and the porn star.  It would make a great sitcom, I think.  The rubbing it over the lips part was good, like kneeling over the face is dominant.  Yeah, that sort of thing.  But then trailing it down the breast, it's awkward because you're on your knees and you've  got to kind of scooch down on your knees.  Yeah, what is that?  You're on a dolly?  Like, how do you do that?  Yeah, your phone sex isn't that accurate.  You're on your knees backwards going...  I'll put it in your mouth and...  It's like a Kubrick shot just coming down the long hallway.  Dollying back as the background gets blurry.  Yeah, we're going to do a push-in. 
[03:00:00]  That's right.  I'll put it in your mouth and then have your toes in my asshole at the same time.  We'll roll down a hill, dirty girl.  Chris, what's going on?  I got a cliffhanger for you.  Yeah, we need a cliffhanger so the people that are on the fence, not sure if they're going  to continue with the show, they need something to, you know, send them over the edge  and they'll continue listening on Monday.  Yes.  Yeah, send Noah to an AIDS test today and give the result on Monday.  Oh.  Noah's AIDS test.  Well, now, the chick is getting an AIDS test.  Yeah, that's my test, too. 
[03:00:30]  Yeah, that would pretty much be his test.  All right.  Can we get those results?  I'll tell you.  I don't care.  I'm sure she's going to let you know.  Well, you'll know on the next text message if she starts to say, like, I can't wait to  suck your cock in the hospital.  I'm sure she's fine, dude.  She's not a cliffhanger.  She's an AIDS.  I want to come visit you again before you lose too much weight.  The cliffhanger here is if I'm ever going to get laid by a real girl again.  This is every guy's fantasy, but it surprisingly doesn't play well with the ladies.  Oh.  Who cares?  Because they're intimidated.  They know they can't do what a porn girl does. 
[03:01:00]  Regular girl kicks.  I live with two girls.  They're my roommates.  Oh, wait a minute.  Of course.  What do you expect to see?  Wait a minute.  You brought the porn star back to the...  Oh, wow.  Wait a minute.  I want to hear what Jack Tripper has to say here.  Yeah, exactly.  You live with two girls.  And how old are they?  They're my age.  Nothing sexual.  Are they attractive?  I grew up with them.  What were they saying when they saw the porn star walking around?  Oh, they did...  Oh, well, they heard it.  They heard the event and the action.  I introduced her to, you know, some of my friends.  My one friend was sick and we just ruined her all day.  She was trying to nap.  Never happened.  All of your friends are girls, by the way. 
[03:01:30]  No, no, no, no.  I'm saying, like, that's all I'm hearing.  So you guys are just banging and not being quiet at all?  Yeah, I got calls from my downstairs neighbors that were like, you know, who are those guys?  You know what?  I guess if you're going to bring a porn star home, I think you want the whole neighborhood to know.  Do the whole show, right?  She's a screamer.  They're going to look at you a lot differently when you're, yeah, doing your laundry in the neighborhood  or picking up your Chinese food, yeah.  With respect.  From you guys.  Not from the ladies.  They don't like it.  Because, again, that's everything that they're not.  A little threatened.  Women try to be sexy, but, you know, a porn star is sexy. 
[03:02:00]  Women in general try to do that, and to be measured against that, they can't hold up.  Text message.  As you take out the garbage bag and put it in the trash.  That's like their sexy line.  As you wash the car and go shopping.  I'll wear a little house coat and flip-flops for you.  Yuck.  Yeah.  Ruby, this is your setup. 
[03:02:30]  Yeah.  I would go for Joyce DeWitt.  Really?  I've got nothing.  Nothing.  We can wait for you.  Right.  This is a person, person, here.  Sweet company, too.  Oh.  Come and fall on our floor.  Grab your chest and shock the crowd.  Oh, my God.  All of those space that meet your face.  Two's company, too.  All right.  I was going for the order joke. 
[03:03:00]  Cancel our series, too.  Oh, another episode where they get all confused about what the other one's saying.  Yeah.  Chrissy said she's positive.  That'd be like the 2000 version of Three's Company.  I heard her say she's positive.  All right.  Noah, there's the update.  He's still in touch with the porn star. 
[03:03:30]  Like a time-lapse camera on my dick.  See what goes on it.  Yeah, see what rots on it.  Yeah, it's cute.  Good luck to you.  Thanks, guys.  I'm sure he's fine.  Of course he is.  I wouldn't even have worn a bag.  That's the difference between me and him.  Yep, you wouldn't have.  No!  I would have laughed at it.  Yeah, but he won't use a bowl from the kitchen here.  He's not fucking the bowl.  Exactly.  Just eating out of it.  Don West, what's up?  Hey, how you doing, fellas?  Uh-oh.  Hi, Don.  I want to help you out with the XM Freeplay to get all these morons out there. 
[03:04:00]  To help get online, call 1-800-XM-RADIO.  It's $1.99 a day.  It's only seven cents a day on stretch pay.  If you act now, we'll throw in a little Jimmy Norton rookie card.  We also have the Wiffle Ball Bat Challenge, including Cherry Darts,  and maybe even the 10-Gallon Drum Challenge.  Closer to May West.  Punching out.  Hey, he gave it a shot.  Reach under the seat and pull the handle, sir. 
[03:04:30]  Yeah.  Mike from Jersey, what's up?  Mikey.  Mike.  We lose Mike?  Jersey City?  Michael.  You want to talk about EverQuest and how he ruined his life?  Michael.  I'm glad I could help ruining his life.  Yeah, he's not happy with you.  Michael.  That game will ruin your life.  All right.  When are we...  Speaking of games, you see my system in the office?  Dude.  It got all set up.  You like it?  Are they hooked up yet?  Oh, it's almost ready to go, but it's all in place.  All set up.  My Alienware computer.  The thing is huge.  The actual box. 
[03:05:00]  Huge.  It looks like the alien's head, doesn't it?  That's it.  Check it out.  Yeah, it looks like the alien's head.  They got everything set up.  I'm ready for gaming.  Prepared for gaming.  Ooh.  I'm very excited.  How long is it going to take before you take that whole system and take it home?  Steal it.  Take it home.  If I...  I know what's going to happen.  Anthony likes to get out.  Well, we all do.  We like to get out of here right after the show.  Yeah.  And live our lives or whatever.  I don't like sitting in traffic, yeah.  Yeah, okay.  But with a system like that, you're going to hang out after the show for a while. 
[03:05:30]  Yeah, sure.  I think for the first month, maybe.  And then all of a sudden, you're going to go, well, why am I playing on this system here  when I could be playing on this system at my house?  At home.  And the whole reason we got you the Mac Daddy system was so you could stick around and hang  out a little bit after the show.  Well, I need to comment on games.  That's part of what I do.  So I needed a huge gaming system here at the station.  I cannot believe they went for that.  Neither can I.  You know what, though?  We do bitch about XM a lot. 
[03:06:00]  Yes, you're right.  Yeah.  But they were asking us what we would need in our office when we were in Washington setting  up this whole deal.  And we just said, oh, what the hell?  We'll tell them we need the nicest gaming computer ever.  The most ridiculous gaming computer.  They didn't even blink.  No, they didn't.  They're not cheap.  They're not cheap.  I'll say that back.  No, they're not cheap.  They hooked me up.  And if I even get an inkling that we're going to be thrown out of here, be fired, the hand  truck's coming out, that system's going home with me.  Hand truck?  You're going to need a group of Teamsters to get that out. 
[03:06:30]  I know.  I've never seen anything like that in my life.  That's the good thing about all of them being down in D.C.  If we get fired, we'll pilfer this place.  They'll come back to nothing.  There will be no equipment left in here.  You don't mean if.  You mean when.  It's always when, Anthony.  I've been telling you that for 10 years.  When we get the boot, this place will be stripped.  Like a car that's broken down by Jerome Avenue on the Cross Bronx Expressway.  Oh, we're going to leave the studio up on blocks. 
[03:07:00]  Just pilfer everything.  My dad was one of those guys.  He would drop the cars off.  What do you mean drop them off?  We'd have a family car that we didn't want anymore.  So two cars would come into the city from Long Island and only one would come home.  Really?  Oh, yeah, man.  He would abandon the cars?  Oh, yeah.  I wish one of my brothers were up.  You used to see that a lot more around New York than you do now.  You're giving it away in a weird way.  Like, yeah, go ahead.  What was it?  The Cross Bronx Expressway was famous for that.  You would see all these cars on the side of the road that were picked clean, like you guys 
[03:07:30]  were just saying.  I am listening today.  I kind of remember driving it in from Long Island years ago as a kid.  The closer you got to the city, the more of these abandoned cars you'd see on the side  of the road.  People from Long Island would bring their cars into the city and then leave them somewhere  and then report it stolen.  Wow.  That was a big thing that was going on for a long time.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  But then my dad, and this is a true story, and I don't know, I'll have to get one of  my brothers on the air to help me out with the story because I was doing radio somewhere, 
[03:08:00]  but when my dad was getting up there in years, instead of driving to the city to drop off the  old family car, he would drop it off like a mile from the house.  Do you remember, like, the Friendly's up on 25A there?  Yeah.  Near my parents' house?  Mm-hmm.  He dropped one in the parking lot of Friendly's.  But it's not going to get wrecked.  No.  Like, the reason you take it into the city is so it gets stripped and wrecked.  But then he reported it stolen, and then my brothers would go, Dad, I see the, you 
[03:08:30]  know, the whatever car up in the Friendly's parking lot.  He's like, oh, no, that's not our car.  I'm like, no, Dad, I see, you know, the Geneseo bumper sticker that Greg gave you when he went  to college on the, it's our car.  No, it's not.  It's got to be someone else's car.  Oh, man.  He got lazy with his scheming.  But would the cops find it?  I don't remember what happened with that one.  Yeah, because they would have to go somewhere.  That's why I have to ask my brothers what happened.  I think they started picking it clean.  After a while, they realized this car wasn't moving, and people started taking parts off 
[03:09:00]  it.  Would he get the insurance money from it?  I don't remember all the details.  I know for a fact that he ended up, yeah, you know, leaving one in the Friendly's parking  lot.  Now with the VIN numbers and stuff, man, you can't do that stuff.  I mean, this goes way back.  Back then, they were just dumbing to the junkyard.  I'm wondering why they don't do that anymore.  Why don't you see a bunch of broken down cars?  Jalopies.  Jalopies.  Hey, Squid, what's up?  Hey, what's up, shit dicks?  Hi, Squid. 
[03:09:30]  Hey, Squid.  I think we're going to have to play that song one more time before we get out of here for  the weekend.  If I can find it, I'd play it right now.  Check this out.  I used to work at a bar and got hammered one night, took this chick home.  She was awesome, dude.  I mean, she was built.  I went down on her, did her.  Well, you know, a few days later, I noticed, you know, I had the drips, if you know what  I'm talking about.  I think we do.  So I had to go to the hospital, get my penicillin shot, go through this whole ordeal with them,  getting a speech. 
[03:10:00]  Went back to the bar, ended up getting shit-faced again, took her home again, went down on her.  And proceeded to have crab, gonorrhea, the whole nine yards.  It was a pretty messed up ordeal.  Why'd you hook up with her again, dude?  I was shit-faced.  I kind of liked it.  I got to respect that.  I was desperate like Norton.  I was doing it that day, just why I did it.  All right.  Well, thank you, Squid.  All right, buddy.  All right.  Bye, guy. 
[03:10:30]  Hi, guy.  Jim in Illinois, what's up?  Jim.  Yeah.  What's up?  Hey.  Jim?  Yeah, what?  Yeah, hello.  Yeah, I'm right here.  Yeah, I just wanted to let you know that.  Hey, Jim.  Yes.  Is Jim on the line?  Jim?  Right here.  Yes, yes, I am.  I'm talking about Jim on the line.  Hi.  Jim?  Hello.  I'm right here.  Okay.  Oh, hi, Jimmy.  Hey, Opie.  What's up?  You look good.  Jim?  I just wanted to let you know what got me. 
[03:11:00]  What's in your pants game?  Well, everyone...  Really?  Because radio sucks so much, you're not hearing anything like that.  Good.  It's great.  Yeah.  I wonder how many people were turned on to the show listening to Shit Dick.  Yeah.  And you know what's odd?  That wasn't like one of our hottest Guess What's in My Pants is.  No, that one sucked.  It gets a lot better than that.  You think...  No, the thing Noah wrote was sexier.  All right.  You want his mule all over the one?  The baby caught her armpit got me.  Oh, really?  It's like, who would have the guts of the balls to say that? 
[03:11:30]  To say what again?  Who would have the balls to say that?  You know, compare that...  I mean, God.  Oh, my God.  That was funny.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  I had no idea.  What?  Baby caught her armpit.  You know, the wood floor.  Oh, a little...  That was a good one.  Thank you.  Thank God.  You know, I think we should tell people, because the free play is going away soon.  Yeah.  The show gets a lot sexier than this.  Sexier?  We've been good boys all week.  Oh, you'll still enjoy the fine comedy that you've been listening to all week, but it also  gets sexier. 
[03:12:00]  We haven't played sexiest state in the United States for the free play people.  No, we haven't.  They have no clue what that's about.  Right.  The competition sweeping the nation.  Couples call up and try to become the sexiest state in the United States.  They put the phone next to them in bed and just have sex, and we get to listen in.  We get to be voyeurs and listen in to their shenanigans in the sack.  Yeah, just something to look forward to next week.  It's pretty hot when you hear the girls screaming, you know, F me, and they're describing what 
[03:12:30]  they're doing.  She's grabbing his head.  He's grabbing her head.  You can't hear what she's saying because her mouth's full.  It's amazing.  If I dare say, a couple in Pennsylvania?  Guy?  Ten-incher?  Girl?  Well, right in the balloon knot.  Backdoor action.  Backdoor action.  But they lost to California.  California is now the sexiest state in America once again.  Wait, are they?  Reclaiming their title.  Yes.  No, no, no.  Wait a minute.  I thought Pennsylvania kept it after the...  No.  That's what I thought.  I think Hope is wrong.  No, no, no. 
[03:13:00]  Ben?  Steve?  Anyone?  Steve?  The California couple...  Was good.  Was good, but I don't think they beat Pennsylvania.  We played the...  Remember you played the awful polka music over them and we were teasing the dirty talk?  They were great, but Pennsylvania, because he was packing ten and she took it in the balloon knot.  Oh, all right.  I apologize then.  Yeah, okay.  Then Pennsylvania is now the sexiest state in America.  Uh-huh.  I thought California reclaimed the title.  I'm sorry then.  Oh, no.  No, Opie.  I'm really sorry.  Opie.  We're going to take a break.  We'll do a twofer here, Anthony.  A twofer?  Yeah, a twofer of O&A bits. 
[03:13:30]  We got the Shit Dick song.  Got to play it one more time before we get out of here.  I love the Shit Dick song.  It's a Toe Tapper and we also have Hi, Mom, I'm in Porno.  So which one do you want to hear first?  I want Shit Dick first.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  And you know what?  We're only on the air for another 45 minutes.  I think we need a speed round here.  I think the listeners need to request all sorts of stuff to get these free players on board for next week.  All right.  How's that sound?  Certainly.  Okay.  So we'll take some requests next and we've got a couple other stories to discuss as well. 
[03:14:00]  But first, here's a little Toe Tapper.  Shit Dick!  We hate all Shit Dick's!  Andy Warhol! 
[03:14:30]  Shit Dick!  Mick Jagger!  Shit Dick!  Michael Jackson!  Shit Dick!  Jeffrey Dahmer!  Cannibal!  Shit Dick!  We hate Shit Dick!  Shit Dick!  Shit Dick!  But Slammin' Shit Dick!  Boy George Shit Dick!  Freddy Mercury Shit Dick!

[03:16:00]  The fucking chintzik!  You're six, six, six!  Rawr!  Who's this?  Michelle?  Hi, Michelle. You want to play Hi, Mom?  Yes, I do.  Alright, I hear you want to play Hi, Mom. I'm in porno.  Yeah.  Yeah!  Awesome!  Now, where does your mom live?  Montana.  Well, what are you doing in Boston?  I'm a nanny.  You're a nanny? Cool.  Maybe you could tell your mom you lost your job as a nanny and you had to make ends meet, so you jumped into porno.  Okay.  Alright, I got your mom's number. I'm giving her the call right now. 
[03:16:30]  Okay.  Nutrition Center.  Hi, can I speak to Jean, please?  Is this Michelle?  Yes, it is. It's important.  Okay, hold on, hon.  Uh-huh.  Now, play it up. Say you lost your job. You had no other choice.  Okay.  You were all alone.  Hello?  Hello.  Mom?  Yeah?  I have a problem. I lost my job.  Why?  Because I just wasn't doing it. I couldn't cope with it, you know.  I thought you said it was going great.  It was, but things just fell apart. I'm having a really hard time, so I didn't tell you sooner because I was too scared to, but now I got a different job. 
[03:17:00]  But I'm doing, but I'm doing, I don't know how to tell you this.  What?  I'm doing, I'm doing porn movies?  No.  Yes?  No.  Mom?  No.  What? I, it's too late.  No.  Mom?  Mom?  No.  Um, I'll, you, hold on.  Okay.  Oh my God. Holy Jesus, I think she believes you. 
[03:17:30]  I'm shaking.  Michelle?  Yeah?  Where can I reach you?  Um, I have, I have like three days to get out of here, so I don't.  You don't do that.  What?  Don't do what you told me.  Well, what am I going to do? How am I going to get home?  You don't have money in the bank?  Well, yeah, but I kind of had to use some of it to get this rolling. I had to get an agent.  No, you don't. Where, where can I call you?  The same number, but Mom?  What? 
[03:18:00]  There's something else I have to tell you.  Happy Mother's Day. I love you. This is just a joke.  I'm on the radio.  Oh my God.  It's a radio program.  Oh.  I just wanted to let you know that I love you.  Oh my God.  I'm thinking about you.  Mom?  You know, I think those things are so funny when they happen to other people.  I mean, I would sit and listen to them all day long because they're so funny, but that, you killed me.  Oh my God.  Mom?  Wait, Mom, we're really nice. 
[03:18:30]  Okay, I am going to kill you.  I love you.  Anyway, Mom, Mom, first kill us.  It's Opie and Anthony.  We're going to have you guys.  We put her up to it.  I got to admit, man, my heart sunk to my damn kneecaps.  Oh my God, I felt so bad for you.  I'm breaking out in a sweat here.  I'm thinking, that's too bad.  Happy Mother's Day.  Well, thank you.  All right.  All right.  What happened to the potatoes?  I have no idea what you're talking about.  From ONA Pictures.  You always like potatoes. 
[03:19:00]  That's not new.  A horrifying story.  Did he forget the potatoes?  Of a man.  I need the potatoes.  Without potatoes.  Danny, you forget the potatoes?  It won't happen again.  I can promise you that.  How far will one man go?  Well, I'm going to have to wait for the potatoes.  For potatoes.  The Potato Diva.  My potatoes are here.  Come here.  Open your mouth.  Eat.  Eat.  Eat your potatoes.  Don't eat.  That's the way to do it.  You say potato.  He says potato.  That's a big thing of potatoes, Danny. 
[03:19:30]  Everything's delicious.  The Potato Diva.  I need the potatoes.  Yeah.  Coming soon.  I want potatoes, and I want eggs, and I want hot sauce.  God, you've gotten fat.  Here's the first fight out.  I like it.  What if you could give the ultimate Major League Baseball fan access to every team all season long?  Now you can.  The game that grew up on the radio joins the next generation of radio.  XM is the official satellite radio network of Major League Baseball.  Here's the windup. 
[03:20:00]  Every team all season long on XM.  Coming in 2005, it's the perfect holiday gift for the Major League Baseball fanatic.  To check out and buy the latest XM radios, go to xmradio.com.  Oh, what a game.  He shoots.  That's ACC basketball.  It's the ACC today.  Tie your shoes nice and tight.  Because ACC basketball is breaking you down.  You better box your man out, because we're grabbing the boards.  Ground ball, baby.  It's the ACC today on XM satellite radio. 
[03:20:30]  Start off the ricochet.  It's Friday, December the 10th, 2004.  I'm Ari Bykovsky with your ACC today.  Wake Forest has a little while to prepare for their next game in Philly, taking on Temple.  Skip Prosser prepares his troops for the Owls.  Well, I mean, Coach Cheney is a Hall of Fame coach.  It's been well documented.  They are unique in terms of our preparation, because they play almost all zone.  They play a rather unique trapping, 1-3-1, 1-2-2, really a plethora of zones.  And you really, you know, you have to, rather than prepare for any one of those, I think 
[03:21:00]  you just have to make sure you are sound in your zone offense principles.  I think I have not seen much of them on tape to this point.  I'm pretty much watching Wake and Wake Richmond and things like that.  But as a week wins its way through, I'll watch more Temple tape.  But again, John Cheney playing Temple in Philly, our road schedule is difficult.  And we have to play, obviously, better than we did against Illinois on the road.  We have to play with more passion.  We have to play with more poise. 
[03:21:30]  And that'll be our challenge to our players this week as we approach Temple in Philly.  Let's go to Duke, where head coach Mike Krzyzewski talks about one of his premier backcourt  players, Daniel Ewing.  Daniel's playing great.  I mean, but, you know, he's also defending well.  He's just got a good presence on the court.  You know, he's being a real veteran.  And you have to remember that Daniel played most of the last season, like a heavy boot  or an orthotic.  It's Duke hosting Toledo on ACC Channel 182. 
[03:22:00]  That game is this Sunday.  Tip-off around 8 p.m. Eastern.  And that's the ACC Today on XM Satellite Radio.  You're listening to the O&A Free Play all week long on High Voltage XM 202.  It is insane.  If you want to keep listening, you'll have to add Opie and Anthony to your XM account.  Call 1-800-XM-RADIO or subscribe online at highvoltage.xmradio.com.  You've never seen anything like this, my friends, ever.

This special offer ends this Sunday.  It's the O&A virus.  XM 202.  XM news, talk, sports, and information.  It's everything.  All the time.  We get an entire nation to sit through a massive picture.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  I hate this place. 
[03:23:00]  Nothing works here.  The medications don't work. 
[03:23:30]  I've been here for seven years.  Nothing works here.  I hate this place.  Nothing works here.  The medications don't work.  Shut up.  You shut up.  I hate this place.  You shut up.  Nothing works here.  You shut up.  The medications don't work.  Shut the fuck up.  You shut up.  Shut up.  You're checking out the O&A virus.  The last day of the free play.  Unless the free play goes all weekend long. 
[03:24:00]  Oh.  It does?  All right.  So you can check out a lot of O&A on the channel over the weekend.  Yeah.  2-0-2.

[03:24:30]  2004 at no additional charge.  Hurry.  This special deal ends this Sunday.  I hope hanging on to that doesn't put you in a bigger tax bracket.  All that extra money you got laying around.  That's right.  Uncle Sam will say it.  I'm assuming that they just have a sense of humor down in Washington.  They can't possibly be that stupid.  No.  Or maybe they think our listeners are so stupid they're going to buy it.  It sounds like you're getting something huge.  Yeah.  50 cents a buck.  Oh, over here.  Okay. 
[03:25:00]  So glad everything's nice and neat today.  Nice and organized.  I still think Ben's area is a little bit messy.  Just a bit.  All right.  Yeah, we're going to take requests for the rest of the show because we really want to  make sure these free players have a fine opportunity to see what we're all about.  A little taste.  You know, we could do a story about a guy getting his nuts bitten off.  Often, this is a horrible story, though.  Oh, you want to do this first?  Holy jeez, this guy.  All right, we can do this first.  This is what you get, though.  This is what you get.  We've all watched Cops, right? 
[03:25:30]  I love watching Cops, and you've seen this happen.  The nude nut job.  And I got another cliffhanger.  How many cliffhangers do we have?  18 by now, I think.  We have the Porn Stars AIDS test.  AIDS test, yeah.  So you'll only know the results of that if you continue listening to O.P. and Anthony after  the free play goes away.  Also, one just came in that's great.  What?  If you sign up for O.P. and Anthony and continue with this fine program, on Monday, you will 
[03:26:00]  hear the drill dough bit.  Oh, wow.  The drill dough bit.  An actual girl taking a drill dough.  Or a girl taking an actual drill dough.  What did I say?  An actual girl.  An actual.  Well, no.  Sure.  No, I was accurate.  How about an actual girl taking an actual drill dough?  Well, because some people might look at her and go, well, she doesn't really look, but  no, she's an actual girl.  She just isn't as hot as the other girls we've come across in our years in broadcasting. 
[03:26:30]  But she's taken it.  But she is taking the drill dough, and you will hear that on Monday.  It's a dildo on the end of a drill.  Right.  And her boyfriend is working her with it, and she is freaking out.  Who the hell is requesting the technical virgin commercial?  I don't think we've even played that on the new O&A show.  Technical virgin.  Remember technical virgin?  Oh, I do remember that.  Holy ass.  That's got to be an old schooler there.  Can I play this really fast?  What's this?  Oh, this is this. 
[03:27:00]  And this is this.  And you remember the technical virgin?  Barely.  There was, um, this was sweeping the nation, where girls could keep their virginity even  though they're having sex.  What was it?  Through, uh, BJ's?  Um.  Oh, or backdoor action.  Yeah, they would save their vagges.  They'd save their vag, but it would be backdoor action.  And, uh, technically.  So they could still have sex, but, and then they would be technically called a technical 
[03:27:30]  virgin.  Yeah, there's still a virgin technically, but they're just having, uh, the backdoor action.  Remember this?  I've got big plans for my future.  A good college, a career, maybe even my own business someday.  But one thing I'm not planning on is getting pregnant.  That's why I choose anal sex.  I mean, sure, it hurts a little, and I wind up walking funny for a day or two, but I think  my future's worth it.  Anal sex.  The smart choice for your future. 
[03:28:00]  There you go.  Remember that?  Why aren't these being played more?  I don't know.  I forgot all about this.  I haven't seen that PSA.  And then there's another version of the same, um, same thing.  I know my mom worries about me.  She's afraid I'll do too much too soon and with the wrong boy.  That's why she got me this.  At first I was a little nervous, but when mom showed me how to use it, I knew boys could  wait.  Now I can have my fun, and mom doesn't have to worry. 
[03:28:30]  Vibrators.  The smart choice for your future.  The smart choice for your future.  How about she's, uh, abstaining from vaginal intercourse with gentlemen, keeping herself  from getting pregnant, and still getting a little pleasure.  All right, here's the story of the day.  K-9 used to subdue naked suspect.  Are you reading this or something else?  Look what he's reading.  What are you reading? 
[03:29:00]  More Scott Peterson stuff.  I gotta hear one of these.  Can't.  One of what?  The tribute songs to Lacey and Connor.  Oh.  Oh.  They're serious.  Yeah, that's not a song parody.  Somebody that decided they were gonna write a little tribute song.  Well, we do have that.  Mm-hmm.  Maybe that will be the cliffhanger.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  No, there are two, so you can make one the cliffhanger.  We only have one, I think.  All right, well, K-9 used to subdue naked suspect.  It was no Christmas elf running from house to house. 
[03:29:30]  Tuesday afternoon around 12.05, it was a man, a stark naked man, checking for unlocked  doors.  Completely naked, going from home to home, right?  There you go.  He found one at Craig Martinson's home.  I know he scattered a bunch of laundry around.  I know he was on all floors.  What does that mean?  Where's that, sweetie?  Either he was on all fours and they made a mistake, or he was on all the floors of this  guy's house.  Either way, it's a mistake, though.  Like if he was in the basement or the...  All right, so the guy broke into a home...  Maybe everywhere he walked was a floor. 
[03:30:00]  The guy broke into a home.  He was stark naked, okay?  A half dozen cops were on the naked man's trail, including an officer with a canine named  Zach.  The cops spotted the naked man inside this guy's home and ordered him outside.  At that point, the suspect leaped toward the canine officer and punched the canine officer  in the head.  Bad move.  That is not a good move.  Bad move.  These dogs are vicious.  Doing what the dog is trained to do, protect the handler, the dog jumped and bit the suspect  in the genitals.  Ow! 
[03:30:30]  In this case, the genitals.  That's correct.  One neighbor says she watched as police appear to recover part of the man's testicles from  the porch area of the home.  Oh, no!  The dog bit his balls right off him.  Just think you're a dog.  That dangling meat, it's a perfect target, and to rip a piece off for a dog is nothing.  That's nothing.  It's just hanging there.  Minneapolis police say their canine officers are never trained to attack the genitals, 
[03:31:00]  but suspects usually aren't naked either, Anthony.  As the neighbor across the street told us, who happens to...  Council member...  What?  Scott Pent?  That doesn't make sense either.  Well, whatever.  This seems to be an incident without precedent.  It's highly unusual.  Don't have much criminal activity since I moved here 15 years ago.  So, obviously, the neighbor has never seen a naked guy get his testicles bitten off by  a canine dog, is basically what's going on there, right? 
[03:31:30]  And the suspect is in serious, stable condition.  Police are investigating whether the suspect was on drugs.  I like this part.  Go ahead.  Even after the canine bit the suspect right in the junk, Minneapolis police say officers  still tasered the suspect several times.  There you are.  You're a bleeding sack because it was bitten off by a dog, and you get a little taser action  too.  You're laying on the ground just hoping the dog doesn't swallow it.  Zach, the canine, has a clean record, but is off the street pending the outcome of an 
[03:32:00]  investigation.  Why?  The dog was doing his job.  Well, now they'll probably have to shoot the dog, right?  Is that what we do in this society?  If I was the owner, I'd shoot him.  You're not going to go home and go,  Give me kisses.  Give me kisses, Zach.  Licking you with man-testicle breath.  Chris on Long Island.  What's up, Chris?  Hey, what's up, fellas?  Hey.  Hi, Buttercup. 
[03:32:30]  Hi.  I just wanted to ask a quick question.  When the testicles were bitten off, did they happen to roll behind a picture frame?  E-er, e-er, e-er, e-er, e-er.  I don't know if you remember the old story from England with the little fray.  Yeah, I know you were on to something.  I like that.  E-er, e-er.  Well, that was the, uh...  Kind of like an English, European stupid siren.  Just like the old story you guys did about a fight in the house, and the testicle rolled 
[03:33:00]  behind a picture frame and couldn't figure out why.  And how did that guy lose his testicle?  I think someone ripped them off.  I suck ass.  Like they were fighting?  Oh, you weren't that bad, actually.  All right.  I'll give it another shot next week, Ben.  Take it easy, guys.  All right.  I think a woman grabbed his sack and pulled and actually ripped one of his testicles out.  I had the best sound clip for this, and it was supposed to be put in, and it's not...  Oh, no.  What?  What happened?  The clip...  Do you know how much... 
[03:33:30]  What?  Not that I want to say.  It's annoying.  What?  Oh, Jimmy.  Now we're all curious.  I know.  What sound effect?  It's just a clip.  It's not a sound effect.  It's just a line from a movie.  That would have fit in so perfect here.  What line?  Why don't you just do it?  Because it wouldn't make sense.  It's funnier if you haven't played.  Do you need a...  No, no, no.  I've only had...  An instant replay?  No, no.  For you, actually.  And I only had two of them.  And you could...  Do you know what I mean?  I don't know.  And I asked, I was like, can you put them in the thing?  And they told me, like, oh, we can't do it while we're on the air.  This was like last week. 
[03:34:00]  Aw.  Well, what clip?  Nah, well, maybe Monday.  Monday.  Okay, nice.  It's a good one, too.  Steve just handed me a new promo for the show.  We'd like to test these out live on the show.  It's called Potato Diva.  Oh, yeah.  We played that one earlier.  Oh, I didn't hear it.  That's when I was in the bathroom?  Yeah, you were going to the bathroom.  Oh, I told you guys we'd listen to it live on the show.  Listen to this.  Was it good?  It's hilarious.  It's very good.  What happened to the potatoes?  I have no idea what you're talking about.  From O&A Pictures.  You always like potatoes. 
[03:34:30]  That's not new.  A horrifying story.  Did he forget the potatoes?  Of a man.  I need the potatoes.  Without potatoes.  Danny, you forget the potatoes?  It won't happen again.  I can promise you it.  How far will one man go?  Well, I'm going to have to wait for the potatoes.  For potatoes.  The Potato Diva.  My potatoes are here.  Come here.  Open your mouth.  Eat.  Eat.  Eat your potatoes.  That's the way to do it.  You say potato.  He says potato.  That's a big thing of potatoes, Danny. 
[03:35:00]  Everything is delicious.  The Potato Diva.  I need the potatoes.  Yeah.  Coming soon.  I want potatoes, and I want eggs, and I want hot sauce.  God, you're getting hot.  Ooh.  That's pretty good.  Very good.  Yeah, I was in the bathroom.  I didn't hear that.  Potato Diva.  Very good, Steve.  He says potatoes.  All right.  Well.  That's very funny.  I didn't know what I was saying yesterday.  Very good.  Thank you, Steve.  Jimmy's drop is actually in the system.  What drop? 
[03:35:30]  Derek?  Because you don't need it now.  Why?  Because it's really now.  You don't need timing and comedy.  Stop.  I've got to hear it.  Yeah, we've got to hear it.  What's the drop?  It would have fit with that clip.  That's all.  All right.  All right.  Do you know how much you bleed when somebody cuts off your balls?  Oh, that is a good one.  It's a great one.  And when are we going to get the opportunity to use that again?  Never.  Do you want me to?  I could reread the story.  And then you just point to me when you need the clip played, and we'll all laugh and laugh and laugh.  All right.  But you have to do it when I point, because I know when the clip should be played. 
[03:36:00]  All right.  Okay.  All right.  Go ahead.  You read the clip.  I'm not a clip reader.  I'm not reading.  All right.  Well, I guess the audience will have to miss out.  Monday, we'll do it.  Monday, we'll do it.  Mike in Jersey, what's up?  Mike.  Hey, Ope.  Yeah.  Hi, boys.  Listen, I actually read in the paper they're getting rid of the dog.  Oh, yeah?  And, yeah, the way they're doing it is they're actually sending him to Opie's house so Opie  can kick him in the liver.  Oh.  Oh.  Ouch.  I really don't know what he's talking about. 
[03:36:30]  Chester.  I have no idea what you're talking about.  Chester.  Like I said, I have no idea what you're talking about.  Chester, where are you, Chester?  Shut up.  Chester.  Shut up.  Chester, where are you?  Shut up.  Chester, why are you limping like that?  Why is Chester boy limping?  This never happens.  As if someone kicked him in the liver.  Shut up.  We agreed. 
[03:37:00]  We're not ready to tell that one yet.  We're not ready.  Not ready?  It's been 10 years.  Shut up.  It's been 10 years.  When will we be ready?  We're just not ready for that story.  Chester.  We're not ready for the Chester story.  Chester boy.  If I didn't know any better, Chester, I would swear somebody kicked you in the liver.  You know what?  I'm going to save myself here.  Chester has.  This will be the cliffhanger.  Chester has.  This will be the cliffhanger.  Shut up. 
[03:37:30]  Chester has liver cancer.  The vet is saying it was caused by something.  No, that's not true.  I believe it could have been a kick to the liver.  But who in my house would kick my beautiful Chester in the liver?  Who?  It's going to be the cliffhanger.  There are only a limited number of people that come into my apartment.  I can count them on one hand.  And I know none of them are mean enough to have kicked the little Chester in the liver. 
[03:38:00]  Bleh!  Bleh!  You don't know what happened.  I wasn't there.  I don't know what happened.  But based on...  Shut up!  We agreed.  Shut up!  Oh, Chester!  Where are you, Chester?  Chester looks a little run down these days.  Shut up.  Chester's not as perky as he used to be. 
[03:38:30]  This will be the cliffhanger.  Maybe we'll finally tell the Chester story on Monday.  Chester.  Where's my dog, Chester?  Chester, you don't look the same happy, peppy pup as I remember from just yesterday.  Chester, is something bothering you, Chester? 
[03:39:00]  Chester, why do you have a Nike print on your side?  Shut up!  Chester, you just saved me, because I've never worn Nikes.  Oh, I made a mistake.  That's not a Nike logo.  I believe it's a Puma logo on your side.  Actually, this is so odd.  If I didn't know any better, I could swear that those are rollerblade prints on your side. 
[03:39:30]  I know one person that rollerblades.  No, no, no.  Now, who do I know that rollerblades?  Hmm.  Chester.  Chester's having problems coming up the stairs.  Dude, he's making all this up, Ben.  Don't look at me differently.  I wonder if this has anything to do with broken stuff around my house.  Shut up!  All the broken items that have just been sitting here for years and years and years. 
[03:40:00]  It's my mother-in-law's, my ex-mother-in-law's dog, Chester.  My mother-in-law.  Opie lived with my mother-in-law for a while.  Just for a little while.  A little while.  Not too long.  When we moved to Massachusetts to do our show at AAF.  A mere couple years.  I know.  I moved in.  It was me and my ex-wife living with my mother-in-law. 
[03:40:30]  I am so happy to have you kids living with me here in Ashland.  This is wonderful.  And Opie's moving in also.  And I was like, in a second, we've got to get out of here.  Get an apartment.  I don't care.  We've got to get out.  Opie wound up living there forever.  Yeah.  You were there for so long.  Like, months and months and months.  Just about a year.  Yeah, it was about a year.  I lived with my mother-in-law for a year.  Do you still keep in touch with her?  No.  Why would I?  It's my ex-mother-in-law.  You might have developed a friendship. 
[03:41:00]  No.  No.  Nice enough woman, but why am I going to keep in touch with her?  You know?  She gets to see...  I send her daughter pictures of Benjamin Franklin, lots of them, every three months.  So I think that's as close of a relationship as we have.  But Opie stayed there, and El Clutzo was constantly breaking stuff.  She had little knick-knacks and trinkets all over the place.  Dude.  Opie would be on the phone, and the phone cord is swinging, hitting humbles.  She was the last person in America that had a cord on her phone. 
[03:41:30]  I know.  And it was like 50 to 60 feet long.  It was so long, so Opie would go out of the kitchen.  No exaggeration.  This cord was 50 to 60 feet, and I like to pace when I'm on the phone.  Yeah.  And it looked like a big tangled slinky when the phone was hung up because it was stretched  out and so tangled.  So Opie would be pulling this thing, and it's trailing this ball of coiled-up phone wire  that's swinging just like a wrecking ball.  It was almost like a tail, like a dog's tail.  Why are my Christmas humbles all broken? 
[03:42:00]  I've had these for years and years and years.  I take perfect care of them.  I don't understand.  I know Chester doesn't jump up where he would break them.  Why is Chester limping?  Why?  Dude.  Chester was flying yesterday.  I have no idea, right?  And now Chester...  I really have no idea.  Stop.  That's what Chester would do all the time. 
[03:42:30]  Maybe if the dog didn't eat my prime rib dinner.  The devil.  Oh, jeez.  That was devilish.  What?  What happened?  The power of Christ compels you.  The power of Christ compels you.  Let's get this...  Cast this demon out.  Anyway.  That's a story for another time, Anthony.  I think I have to find out right now what happened to my little boy Chester.  He's since passed away. 
[03:43:00]  And his ashes are in an urn in my living room.  But I don't understand.  He seemed fine.  And then all of a sudden, out of the clear blue,  he all of a sudden developed a limp.  And he couldn't get up the stairs.  And Anthony had to come over and carry Chester up the fucking stairs.  Oh, every day.  Thanks.  The dog was old.  Real old.  The dog was old.  It was real old. 
[03:43:30]  And because he was old, I'm sure he didn't need any sudden shocks.  No, the dog was arthritic, obviously.  He didn't...  He didn't know sudden shocks to his little old body.  Like maybe a fall, because he's old.  Perhaps if something was...  What did I do to you today?  Or perhaps...  What did I do to you today?  He doesn't need to be hit by a car.  Or walk out and have the paper boy throw something and hit him.  Or perhaps being kicked in the side.  All right. 
[03:44:00]  What kind of dog was Chester?  A lovable mutt.  Aw.  Just a lovable mutt.  I had him since he was a little puppy.  Now he's gone.  My Chester.  Do you want to hear the Lacey Peterson song?  Oh.  Yes.  Whew.  Whew.  Another tragedy.  All right.  So what's up with the Lacey Peterson song? 
[03:44:30]  You got a yawn in front of everyone?  Well, I'm stretching.  Are we keeping you awake?  Yeah.  So what's the deal?  I'm serious.  Is this a real Lacey Peterson song?  Yeah.  No parody.  I just want to see what kind of drivel...  Who is this person?  His name is Tony Handy.  He's 50, which means he's a failed songwriter.  Right.  A failed performer.  Everyone has been moved by the events as they unfold.  Said Tony Handy.  As the story went on, I wanted to get more involved.  Great. 
[03:45:00]  Of course you did.  He wants to capitalize.  This is like the guys, the fans, right after 9-11.  Oh, my God.  Almost as tragic as the event itself were the songs that came out after 9-11.  Every band and every bad singer decided that they were going to pull the country together  in song after 9-11 and really put forth a song that could capture the emotions and what  we were feeling. 
[03:45:30]  Ugh.  All of them sucked.  We actually played a bunch of them on the air and tried to figure out what cornball lines  they were going to try to rhyme with another.  You just hit the nail on the head because there was two guys that actually wrote songs.  And it also says, both men previously wrote musical tributes about other tragic events.  Strand, a guard at dual vocational institution at Tracy, composed Song for America, a patriotic  folk song, four days after September 11th. 
[03:46:00]  Four days.  Ugh.  They just want to be involved and they want people to look for them as passionate artists.  Yeah.  And you're all over 40 and you failed performers.  Failed.  Miserably.  Failed.  Those songs, they were rhyming like, I don't know, shame and plane.  Tower and power.  Tower.  But we have the power.  Oh, and we were just sickened.  Yeah.  Ugh.  This guy's just trying to get some kind of recognition with a song about a tragedy. 
[03:46:30]  So this guy decides he's going to append a Lacey Peterson song.  I bet it's just sappy.  Oh, yeah.  And drippy.  Well, let's take a listen.  Let's give a little.  I just want to see what he uses to word with the rhyme mouthy.  She was lippy.  And as a result, her and Connor got drippy.  Ah.  Ah, it starts off nice.  Nice.  Shit dick.  The lounge version. 
[03:47:00]  Remembering Lacey.  Ooh.  How her smile would make you smile.  Remembering Lacey.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  How she loved her 29th.  What?  Our smile would make you smile.  Her smile would make anyone smile.  Her smile would make you smile.  Is that what he rhymed?  Apparently her s-  Oh, I didn't catch the same word.  You're right.  I think it is.  Well, we're going to have to play that.  One of Jim's part again, I think.  And then we can see what he rhymes it with. 
[03:47:30]  I think I heard denial.  Denial.  Remembering Lacey.  How her smile would make you smile.  Remembering Lacey.  How she loved there's no denial.  Now the angels hold her gently.  And little Connor's with her too.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, my God. 
[03:48:00]  And little Connor.  He put little Connor in.  The only thing.  The only reason he should be saying denial is if that's the river she's at the bottom of.  Oh, God, no.  Ding, ding, ding.  It sucks.  It does suck.  There's no denial.  It's true of the rest of it.  Don't denial.  Remembering Lacey.  And the way that fat stomach would annoy you when you're going to fuck Amber.  Oh, Jesus, guys.  He put little Connor in.  I know.  And she smiles and says, we're all right. 
[03:48:30]  And we send our love to you.  Yeah.  Get your lighters out, everyone.  What rhymes with Connor besides he's a little goner?  Her life and happiness was pretty Lacey's life.  Uh, Stripe.  With little Connor on the way just made things seem so right.  Still the two of them together from the start to heaven's door.  And she smiles and says, we love you to the one she's loved before. 
[03:49:00]  The tears that fell made flowers bloom on earth in heaven, too.  And little Connor runs and picks them.  Even though he's blue.  Mama, he's for you.  Oh, this is our own glory.  Put on a little Connor voice.  Can we hear the little Connor voice again?  Mom, these are for you.  These are for you.  Oh, thank you, fetus. 
[03:49:30]  What is that cord coming out of your stomach?  A little bouquet of seaweed he gives her.  You guys are insane.  I am convinced you guys are insane with this.  Who can't see?  This is dribble.  Oh, mom.  Hell made flowers bloom on earth in heaven, too.  Ugh.  And little Connor runs and picks them. 
[03:50:00]  Mama, these are for you.  Now the angels are in heaven.  Why does he talk like Raj from What's Happening?  Little wigger.  Special tributes from afar.  Yo, moms.  These are for you.  As you gaze into the heavens, look.  The Lacey Connor star.  No!  Ugh.  How about the Lacey Connor bully?  Shut up!  You shut up!  You shut up!  You shut up!  You shut up!  You shut up!  You shut up!  Shut up!  Shut up!  Shut up!  Shut up!  Shut up!  Shut the fuck up! 
[03:50:30]  You shut up!  You shut up!  Shut up!  Remembering Lacey, how she loved there's no denial.  Now the angels hold her gently.  Turn it off.  And little Connor's with her, too.  Turn it off.  And she smiles and says, we're all right.  And we send our love to you.  And we send our love to you. 
[03:51:00]  Yeah!  That is awful.  Wow, that is horrific.  Hey, can we get one of these guys on the phone for Monday?  Is that possible?  Oh, yeah.  Did we play the song?  I think we should interview one of these guys.  Yeah, we want to see what he's all about.  That's the only one?  Oh, no!  That isn't on the song!  Great ending!  Oh, that's perfect. 
[03:51:30]  Oh, that is hilarious.  A little bouquet of seats.  One body enter, two bodies leave.  Oh, is that horrible?  Oh, yuck.  Mama, these are for you.  That is everything that's wrong with music.  Rod Stewart, shit dick. 
[03:52:00]  And AIDS and Scott will kill you.  That was awful.  Thanks.  Wow.  Let's go down to Orlando.  Dave, what's up?  Oh, what's going on, man?  Hey.  Oh, God.  I've been listening to you guys for the past two days on the Freeview, and I haven't been  able to sleep.  Oh, good.  I swear, if somebody is waiting until this very last minute to sign up, what a bunch of  schmucks.  I agree.  This show will go away unless you add it to your XM radio account. 
[03:52:30]  Absolutely.  It's two bucks.  Two lousy dollars.  Yeah, I know.  Thanks, buddy.  Well, thank you, buddy.  Yeah, no problem.  I wish you guys the best of luck.  Look forward to hearing you on Monday.  On Monday, it gets a lot seedier.  Mama.  These are for you.  A bouquet of seaweed.  We got to go out to Phoenix.  What's up, Rob?  Hey, guys.  How you doing? 
[03:53:00]  Pretty good, man.  I'm a former Marine.  I'm a truck driver, and I've heard a lot of rough shit, but I've never heard anything  as offensive and gross as you are.  Oh, really?  Is that a compliment?  And that's why I'm signing up.  All right.  All right.  I was scared there, man.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you, sir.  Listen, can I get the address of the Little Connor Loves Company Fund so I can spend in  all the money I save?  All that money he's saving for the rest of the year free. 
[03:53:30]  It's dollars.  Lots and lots of dollars.  Thanks, Rob.  Thanks, Mike.  We appreciate it.  Thanks, guys.  All right.  See you.  Getting requests for this little thing here.  Hey, Mama.  Hey, Mama.  Hey, Mama.  Here's the football gay preview.  Rerun and DeWayne are coming over.  Today was a little Puerto Rican.  He would have said, hey, Mommy.  Hey, Mommy.  This for you.  Yuck.  Football gay preview.  We'll take more requests, and we'll play What Do We Learn?  We're not going to break.  We're just playing this and coming back.  I didn't go for it at all. 
[03:54:00]  It's coming to the gay channel.  What is up?  It's the second annual male group orgy competition.  And he hits the hole right after Jesse opens it up.  With your host, John Madden and Pat Summerall.  And then everyone's kind of slopping around down there and grunting and groaning.  And, you know, you get mud and stuff flying and gang tackles and scrums and quagmires.  No fems, fats, or hairys.  Just the hunkiest gay studs in wild group action competition.  I'd like to pack that guy around, too. 
[03:54:30]  Don't get carried away, John.  There was all kinds of stuff flying around there.  It's male group sex to die for, as described by the best play-by-play team in the biz.  That was a late one.  That one didn't come and didn't come and didn't come and finally they threw it out of there.  I don't know where that one came from.  Look at that big old beaten lob.  Whoa, what a meal those guys are having.  That look good.  That's a good group.  If you go nuts for tight butts.  You push, you push, you push. 
[03:55:00]  Get Gaperview today.  And just load him backwards.  Just put him right on his back.  With Pat Summerall and John Madden.  That looked like it was the last shot out of the Roman candle.  The second annual male group orgy competition on Gaperview.  I'd like to pack that guy around, too.  Floyd, yeah.  He's going to fire into his guy right here.  Call 1-800-HEY-CUTIE to order today.  They don't show you 10 years later when Connor is torturing animals or being arrested for things. 
[03:55:30]  Connor's a bad boy.  They will not stop talking about it.  How can we not?  You guys are unbelievable.  A little dead kid handing flowers over.  It's creepy.  Salt water unwraps the duct tape from the bag around her head.  Oh, my God.  Jerry Lee Lewis from Whackbag, Anthony, from Charlotte.  Just like Opie's family cars, two left the house but only one return.  Oh, God.  Very nice.  Yeah.  They want to know if Linda McCartney is singing that song, Anthony? 
[03:56:00]  Look, see, now people like Mike are saying he's got an idea for the song.  He liked the splash, but he goes, please play the sound of the motorboat speeding away.  God help us.  Chuck in Ohio, what did you learn on the show today?  Today I learned that with Fallon Gong, you get happy endings for your dong.  Oh, there you go.  Very good.  Yeah, I forgot about that.  All right.  Let's go to Rob in or on or from.  I think it's Long Island, so it should be Rob on Long Island. 
[03:56:30]  Yes, Rob.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  How's my sweet tits doing?  Hi, fella.  I'm okay.  Thanks for asking.  How are you?  No problem.  I'm doing good.  I learned that Jimmy Norton has sensitive baby head skin all over his fat, pudgy body.  You're right.  Yeah.  Unfortunately, we did learn that.  Jim on Long Island.  What's up, Jim?  Hey, what up, Opie?  I just want to know if you ever cooked chest or fish it?  Let's move on to Darren.  That's funny.  Who's in Orlando.  What's up, Darren?  Oh, wait, wait.  What's going on?  Hey, Opie, this is for you. 
[03:57:00]  What?  I learned that the free play cliffhanger is Opie kicking the family's pet in the liver.  Nice job, Dick.  I didn't do no such thing.  Little Jimmy.  Little Jimmy.  Hey, Helen, these are for you.  Candy over a cape.  A fistful of cape.  Todd from BlackBag.com.  Yes, Todd.  Good morning, boys.  Good morning.  Hello.  Hello.  Good morning, sweet cheeks.  Hi, Angel Eyes.  Hey, I learned today that if the buffet includes crabs, Jimmy's going back for seconds. 
[03:57:30]  Oh, that's right.  He did go back for seconds.  Hey, also, if you guys get a chance, take a look at the unofficial Tony Danza website.  The Army did a job on its guest board last night.  Oh, we'll have to take a little look.  Again they did it?  They hit it again?  I think the unofficial one.  On the unofficial one.  Yeah, the guest book has all kinds of Peterson family references.  Oh, my God.  Sonny got mad.  We hit the Danza board at 2 o'clock this morning.  4 o'clock this morning. 
[03:58:00]  Funky Treasure checking in.  He writes, I learned that prime rib can cause liver problems in dogs today.  Oh.  I don't know what he's talking about there, Anthony.  Connor Peterson checking in.  Today I learned that Brian Regan's peanut butter bit two years ago is what got you guys fired.  Oh, did Lacey say a Hail Mary before the splash?  Every time I said a Hail Mary, I caught a bouquet of seaweed, says Freddy F. from Philly.  I love the Godfather reference.  They're always funny.  Bob Puppa writes, Regan's son's microphone is part of the Voss stand-up comedy kit. 
[03:58:30]  Ah, Regan.  Oh, wait, not Reagan.  Oh, Regan, yeah.  Yes, I was a stand-up comic.  I'm tired.  We're going to go see Brian Regan tonight.  It's going to be fun.  Spooge Demon, today I learned that dead fetuses know perfectly good English.  Oh.  Andrew Long, I learned that a bouquet of seaweed will get Opie out of the animal murder conversation every time. 
[03:59:00]  Uh.  Mama, these for you.  Uh, just stunk.  Oh, Lacey Starr.  Oh, my goodness.  Dribble being written.  Well, Starr is a big bloated thing of gas, so.  All right, all right.  Oh, no.  All right, even Anthony couldn't.  Wow.  That's technically true.  Jeff in Iowa, what's up?  Well, I learned that when Norton was forced to take the key out of the program, he just brought it into the elevator.  Yeah.  You're right.  Yeah, out of the program, it's the elevator. 
[03:59:30]  That's very good.  Matt, on Long Island.  What's up, Matt?  What's up, Matt?  Today I learned that Fred the Elephant Boy is the leader of the Majuang.  I don't really get that one.  Tim, what's up?  I don't know what that is.  Yo, selling gum makes you invisible, and people set themselves on Steve to do it.  Very good.  Yes.  Duke in Jersey, what's up?  Yeah, I learned that Lillard Conner picks seaweed and algae and sinks to the bottom.  Hey, Mama, here's some flowers.  What a mess.  What a mess your presentation was, Matt. 
[04:00:00]  I like the sound effect at the end, though.  It really sounded like he was going down.  Yeah, boom, boom, boom, boom.  Peter from WhackBag.com, he learned that Noah stores rent boys on his phone.  Rev wants to say, hey, Opie, why don't you donate your pickled punk to the Peterson family as a consolation prize?  Holy S.  Oh, first 1,000 pickled punks.  Demon Seed from WhackBag.com.  We should also mention the other Opie and Anthony message board, opianthony.net.  Right.  And learn that Noah is horrible at text messaging sex.

[04:02:00]  One night I didn't have a condom.  Don't go home and try that shit either.  You know, people should laugh if that's good for you. 
[04:02:30]  The problem is you can't go out and see a comedian every night of the week.  You people have got to learn to amuse yourselves.  And I'm going to give you a couple of tips.  Like, for instance, the next time you're the lead car in a funeral procession,  make a wrong turn.  Oh, what the heck.  Lead everybody through a car wash.  Hot wax for the bereaved.  My favorite thing, you can do this any time.  The next time you're in the supermarket,  put things in other people's buggy when they're not looking. 
[04:03:00]  And they'll get behind them in the checkout line.  I swear you'll see them.  They'll be like this, like.  I don't remember getting that.  Then they'll pay for it.  Or if you should ever have to fill out another job application  where it says nearest relative, put 12 miles.  100 channels of crystal clear digital audio.
