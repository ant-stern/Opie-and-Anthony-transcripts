<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with slapstick sound effects, likely involving paint, immediately transitioning into a discussion about their recent 30% ratings drop.  The hosts dismissed the drop as statistically improbable, criticizing media reporting for failing to acknowledge this. This led to a humorous anecdote about a painting crew unexpectedly hired by the station, resulting in a paint-avoidance game amongst the staff, several of whom were “infected” with paint. The hosts attributed management’s absence to the ratings crisis, and a caller suggested the painting was in preparation for a station sale. Several callers weighed in on the ratings decline, with one former coworker, John, pointing to Leslie’s departure as a negative factor, while others offered various explanations, including listener shifts to other shows. The hosts countered by highlighting their success in specific demographics, even jokingly suggesting an FBI agent (Fox Mulder) was investigating the "missing" listeners.  The segment ended with a promotion for their "Whipped Cream Bikini Contest," detailing prizes and rules.

Laura, a stripper from Monticello, NY, then entered the studio.  Her presence led to a humorous geographical discussion concerning Monticello's location relative to Thomas Jefferson's home. Laura participated in the Whipped Cream Bikini contest, sparking further discussion of her profession and the contest. This segued into a conversation about a host's wife's bachelorette party at a Chippendales club, highlighting a perceived double standard regarding men and women attending strip clubs.  More promotion for the contest and an advertisement for Pinnacle Horny Goat Weed concluded this segment.

The next segment delved deeper into the double standard surrounding men and women at strip clubs.  Callers, including John (a former Chippendales employee), provided explicit accounts of the stark differences in patron interaction with male and female strippers.  Stories included women cutting off male strippers' G-strings with scissors, reactions to photos taken at these clubs, and the concept of "crime scene sex".  Barry Williams (Greg Brady) made a humorous guest appearance, discussing a potential new Brady Bunch project and a caller’s failure on *Who Wants to be a Millionaire*.  Additional callers shared their experiences with the gendered dynamics at strip clubs and bachelorette parties, punctuated with vulgar language and sexually suggestive content. This segment also incorporated the Whipped Cream Bikini Contest, with Barry Williams participating.

A discussion about a Chinese aphrodisiac, "Monkey Taekwanyin," preceded another whipped cream bikini contest. Guests included Barry Williams, Madison and Alexis (adult entertainers from Privilege Gentleman's Club and Penthouse, respectively – Alexis being a Penthouse Pet runner-up).  The conversation became sexually explicit, detailing the women's bodies and the ingredients used in magazine photoshoots.  Barry Williams participated in the contest, applying whipped cream to Madison, with a brief technical issue focusing the camera on Barry instead of the contestant.

Kate/Claudia, another guest, was introduced, showcasing her tattoos and engaging in sexually suggestive conversation with the hosts and Barry Williams. She performed flexible feats and a balloon trick, sharing stories about her brother, a past sexual encounter with a roommate, and her experience with a carrot. The conversation continued its sexually explicit trajectory, encompassing discussions of sex toys and explicit sexual acts, interspersed with advertising for adultshop.com. The segment concluded with the ongoing whipped cream bikini contest and more sexually explicit conversations.

A later segment featured Alexis, the Penthouse Pet, discussing her work as a dancer, bartender, singer, and songwriter. She promoted an upcoming Penthouse Beer Party hosted by Opie and Anthony.  A call from her brother was attempted but unsuccessful.  This transitioned into a Rockaway Bedding commercial with sexually suggestive innuendo.  Barry Williams returned, and a caller, “Vinny the Racist,” briefly commented on the lack of diversity in *The Brady Bunch*.  The remainder of the segment focused on Barry Williams, discussing his career, experiences with the *Brady Bunch* cast, and a recent union issue.  The conversation remained sexually suggestive. A significant portion featured a female guest and her boyfriend, John, recounting their sexually explicit first encounter.  The hosts then proposed a "Wiffle Ball Bat Challenge" for the female guest, involving Barry Williams examining her anatomy. This challenge, performed on-air, was graphic and sexually suggestive, followed by listener calls recounting their takeaway from the broadcast – often explicit observations. The show concluded with promotion for Barry Williams' website, an upcoming softball game, and Planet Java coffee.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  And I hate you all.  Oh!  And I hate you all.  Oh!  And I hate you all.  Oh!  And I hate you all.  Oh!  Ah!  You've got to hurt me!  Little turkey, I don't need to talk to you.  All right, kids, hold on your hats.  One, two, three.  Ow!  You'll blow as much as you can.  You'll blow as much as you can. 
[00:00:30]  You'll blow as much as you can. 
[00:01:00]  You'll blow as much as you can.  You'll blow as much as you can.  You'll blow as much as you can.  Unbelievable.  I can't go on.  Opie and Anthony.  Come on, it's not funny anymore.  Make it stop.  Make it stop.  One, two, seven.  That's not an AP double bubble.  There you go.  Oh, my God.  Two, one, two, seven, five, seven, one, oh, two, seven. 
[00:01:30]  You should see all the people outside the studio door looking at their hands going, how did this paint get on my hand?  Green or aqua paint, whatever color that is.  So far, how many people infected with the paint?  Three.  Three from the show and at least two other employees of WNAW.  Just to back up a little bit here.  Oh, by the way, hey, it's the ONA show.  The show no one's listening to anymore.  Yes.  According to the critics, you effing fool.  Ouch. 
[00:02:00]  The ratings came out last week?  Yeah.  And WNAW?  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  But that's not new, right?  This could be a best of so far from what you've said.  I know.  How many times has that happened?  But according to the latest ratings, WNAW lost 25% of their listeners?  Yeah.  Let me tell you something.  The critics, the media, they're doing stories about other people and how their careers are over. 
[00:02:30]  Yeah.  It is impossible to lose 25% of your audience in three months.  Yeah.  It is impossible.  But none of the critics or the media will tell you that.  People don't care about radio that much where 25% of your total audience is just going to say goodbye to your radio station.  It's impossible.  To disappear like that.  Yeah.  It's impossible. 
[00:03:00]  Are we making excuses?  No.  Not at all.  We took a hit in the ratings.  I'll be the first to admit it.  But it's impossible to lose 25% of your entire audience in three months.  In our case, it happened in one month, by the way.  Yeah.  If you break down the ratings, we went from a 5.2 overall to a 3.7.  So do the math.  That's like over 30%.  Yeah.  So we've lost 30% of our audience in three months.  But if you break down the book even further, because I studied this all weekend. 
[00:03:30]  Yeah.  You did, did you?  It happened in one month.  One month.  That is impossible.  Yeah.  Okay?  But none of the critics or the media is going to tell you that.  Let me tell you about my studies that I did over the weekend.  Bacardi will F you up.  Much more than Captain Morgan.  You could lose 30% of your brain cells in one weekend, though.  But, but I mean, you know, I mean, they're doing news reports on TV and all the newspapers  are having fun with this. 
[00:04:00]  You know, the fact is we're still kicking some serious ass.  Yeah.  I wouldn't, I don't put too much credence in it, whether it goes up a lot in one book  or down a lot.  You can't, you can't sit there jumping for joy when you get a spike.  No.  Because it's not, it's not really accurate.  You got to take it as an average overall over like a, let me tell you, let me tell you  what happens too.  Let's say, let's say, knock on wood, our ratings go right back up into the fives.  That means 30%, we got, we gained 30% more audience in three months. 
[00:04:30]  That's impossible too.  I think.  It's easy to say it's impossible when you take a hit like, like the station did and other  shows in this market.  Yeah.  But I'm telling you guys, it's impossible.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Just imagine radio listening in general.  All those cars out there on the highways and the byways.  They all had to get together in a three month period and say, you know what?  I don't like WNEW anymore.  I don't like this guy anymore.  I don't like this radio station anymore. 
[00:05:00]  It's impossible.  And it pisses me off that the, the, the critics and the people that have been writing about  radio in this town for many, many years, much longer than you and I have been here, they  don't point this stuff out to you.  Nah.  You know?  And not just us, not just this show.  You know, hell, we'd love to talk about it, but obviously they'd dump out down the hall.  But other shows in this market, like you're saying, it's not a, sometimes that just happens  in the, um, in the rating. 
[00:05:30]  Right.  And I don't think any of, uh, other shows ratings have taken that severe a dive as it's portrayed  in the, in the paper and stuff.  I was seeing news reports of the, uh, the death and, uh, you know, subsequent, um, dethroning,  let's just say, of, uh, certain personalities.  It's impossible.  Yeah.  I'm going to say it over and over again.  And you could say, oh, you guys are crying and blah, blah, blah.  You know, it's not going to affect our careers.  We're in the middle of, uh, negotiating and we're going to do just fine. 
[00:06:00]  So this is, I'm just telling you the facts.  Yeah.  You know, it, is the show, uh, better today than it was three months?  I don't know.  Maybe not.  Maybe we've, uh, you know, faltered a little bit, but that's, that's what happens when  you do this type of radio.  It's kind of like a roller coaster.  You ride it out, you dip down a little, you come back up, but to lose, uh, over, over  30% of your total audience in three months.  And in our case, in one month's period, cause, cause when the first, uh, trend of this book  came out, we were in the toilet.  So, so in 30 days, people decided, uh, that we're not great anymore. 
[00:06:30]  We went from great to sucking in 30 days.  That's impossible.  And it frustrates me that David Hinckley and John Minnelli and, uh, the New York Radio  Message Board and Fox News and, and all of them, Newsday, they're not talking to the experts  and, and, uh, you know, trying to find out why, um, a bunch of high profile shows, you  know, took some serious hits in this ratings book.  Right.  I didn't want to get too serious about that because I did have a point to make. 
[00:07:00]  That aside, uh, WNW still sucks.  Oh yeah.  We're not going to make believe that, uh, this is a great radio station.  Of course not.  Mm-hmm.  But, uh, yeah, we took a major hit as a station as well in the ratings.  So what did management decide?  This is, see, I'm coming right back around.  Coming around.  To the pain on the hands.  I'm thinking, I'm thinking after the day we all had Friday with the ratings coming in  and everyone, like, um, you know, everyone left the station and went drinking heavily.  Yeah.  We had to stay around because we had a show to do, so we did our drinking heavily on the 
[00:07:30]  air.  On the air, sure.  I'm thinking, okay, you know, people are, the management's really bummed and stuff.  They're going to drink it off on Friday and they're going to, they're going to spend  the weekend getting plastered and then, and then on Monday it'll be business as usual.  Let's move forward and see what we can do to make this, to make this a better, uh, radio  station, right?  Think about it over the weekend and then just come out like gangbusters on Monday to,  bring the station up from these guys.  I mean, cause you got, you know, yeah, you could cry and complain and stuff, but after 
[00:08:00]  that, you got to realize, uh, you know, going down that much in the ratings, some of it is  the fault of the station, of course.  Other, other, uh, false could be bad sampling and all that, whatever.  Yeah.  But in general, you know, oh my God, we, we still have a lot to fix around here.  So, uh, we come in today and I'm like, and I'm looking around like, okay, what do they  got?  Maybe they got the big wigs from the company coming in to kind of take a look around, see  what's going on.  Sure.  Oh no, we got a painting crew.  They're painting.  New, you know, brighter colors might help. 
[00:08:30]  Painting crew and management nowhere to be seen today.  Also.  Because this station is just, just fine how it is.  Uh, Jeremy and Ken, they don't need to be around.  After a horrible ratings book, they're gone.  Taking a long weekend.  And we got a painting crew, uh, painting the place up.  Now, in between the hours of, uh, 7 PM and 5 AM, it's a long time.  There is no one here.  I mean, the station is effing automated.  There's a guy in here that plays tapes of other shows. 
[00:09:00]  Wouldn't it be wise to do the painting then?  Of course.  There is wet paint everywhere.  All of a sudden, so far, uh, Rick has been infected.  Well, we're playing a game.  Our own stinky.  We're playing a game because the only warning we got was Pete the engineer going, oh, by  the way, don't touch anything.  We're painting today.  Watch out for the wet paint.  I mean, you know, I know the painting guy who just went in the bathroom, he's going to  hear this.  I know he's doing a great job, but you can't even tell that they're, you know, putting  a new coat on.  Doesn't it look like the, the old coat?  Is that old?  That's old or new. 
[00:09:30]  Open up the door.  Let's see the new.  Hey, let me see your hand.  Hey, painting guy, doing a great job.  He's mad at us now.  All right.  It's, it's a little brighter open.  Right.  Same color, but it's.  All right.  So, uh, Pete just warns us and said, don't touch anything.  You know, uh, we're painting.  Don't touch it.  Know how, know how sad WNEW is?  They, if you're going to paint, right?  Yeah.  A station that just blows, right?  Wouldn't you pick a new color?  Maybe to like change things around a little bit. 
[00:10:00]  No, it's the same dull, puke green everywhere.  It's like that, uh, it's like some kind of an army color.  You know?  Mm-hmm.  Like this neutral thing.  I'm sure it was tested.  I'm sure the color was tested.  Uh, that it, uh, it sparks productivity.  We can't even paint right around here now.  I would get a whole new paint and a whole new vibe.  Why not?  You know?  But no.  So, so anyway, um, we're, we're, we're having a, like, a little side contest to see who will  be left standing at the end of the show and not get paint on them. 
[00:10:30]  Who's out so far?  I'm out.  Rick's out.  Stinky!  Stinky got hit.  And Jesse got hit.  Jesse's out.  You out, Stink?  You got out.  And it wasn't on this door.  It was from some other door.  What do you got, a little on your knuckles?  You can use, no one can even see it.  Come on, we got to like, let me see it.  Oh, you got it.  Where is it?  Say, thank you.  You might see me in.  You watched the band.  I did not.  I thought you said you got it.  Show Anthony.  I thought you said you got it. 
[00:11:00]  Anthony will decide.  Let me see.  You got it.  You got it.  You got it.  It's on you.  You're out.  He's out too then.  You didn't have any paint.  And Jesse's out.  We can't.  And how many other people are walking around with paint on them?  I looked out the window.  It's funny.  Everyone's like, oh, I got it.  You know, it's funny.  Look at the door.  Open the door.  Look at the door.  Because the studio door has to stay closed when we're on.  Right.  Look at the ring around the door.  Well, you don't see that when it's shut because it's in the door, Jane. 
[00:11:30]  Timmy.  Yeah, what's going on?  My boys are painting the studio, man.  I'm painting.  They're doing a great job.  It wasn't us that picked out the code.  That's the management's fault.  No, I understand all that.  They're doing a great job, you know, painting and stuff.  But what I'm saying is, you know, I can't believe management decided that this place needs a new paint job out of all the things that this place needs.  And second of all, I can't believe management would stick with the same puke green color.  That's true. 
[00:12:00]  I gave it to Eddie.  Eddie picked out the color.  That's all I know.  I'm the driver for the company.  And I brought over the color samples.  And he picked out the paint.  Hold on.  Wait.  All right.  Hold on.  That is losing.  All right.  Who picked out the paint?  From what I understand, I dropped off call schemes to this guy named Eddie.  Attention, Eddie.  I don't know who it is.  Are you kidding me?  It's the name of God.  I actually, I was there this morning dropping all dropped quartz and the stick.  All right, listen. 
[00:12:30]  And I went to speak to Eddie, and some guy with a big grin on his face came to see me.  Okay.  Listen, we've got to let everyone in on this carefully, okay?  Because we love Eddie.  All I can tell you guys without, um, hmm, live in law, live in law, live in law, Eddie.  Okay.  Eddie!  Oh, no.  Eddie.  Oh, no.  Eddie is a few fries short of a Happy Meal.  Let's just put it that way, okay?  Oh, okay.  And he is now making decisions around it. 
[00:13:00]  God damn it, I love this place.  I really do.  It's not...  All right, guys.  You guys suck.  All right, Tim.  All right.  Staring at the paint samples like a Ferris wheel.  He dropped all paint samples, Eddie.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  I like that color.  I like that kind of candy.  That's too funny. 
[00:13:30]  John, what's going on?  Listen, you dopes.  Yeah.  Don't you see the writing on the wall?  What do you mean?  When you're ready to sell real estate, what do you do?  You paint up the rooms and blah, blah, blah.  Yeah.  They're selling the station, man.  They're getting it all nice, so, yeah, potential buyers could take a look.  That's right.  Sure.  I wouldn't be surprised.  Of course.  That's what they're doing.  All right.  Hey, don't you guys remember me?  I'm John the CO.  John?  I had to fight on the air with O.D.  Oh, right on.  What's up, John?  Yeah, you guys haven't had me on in a long time. 
[00:14:00]  I'm mad at you.  Oh, now you're on today.  There you go.  All right.  Listen, you know what?  I don't listen.  I listen to you guys, and I listen to...  That's true.  That's why your ratings went down.  A lot of people, when they kicked Leslie off the air, a lot of people said, we're not  listening to a lot of shows on the station.  That's not true either.  And they also said they weren't going to listen to hers, too?  No.  Well, how much did hers go down?  Everyone went way down.  I don't know.  I didn't hear that this morning.  I was working overtime in the prison today. 
[00:14:30]  Well, there you go.  You like her, and you're not even listening.  That's good.  They don't allow us to carry FM radios in the prison.  What do you want from me?  All right, John.  Thank you.  All right, babe.  Bye.  And run away, Jim.  Yes, Eddie's the guy who also brings the mail.  Right.  Because a lot of people are asking that.  Yes.  Mike.  Hey, what up, boys?  Hey.  Hey, why don't you go over what everybody's rating was and how it did compare it to the  last book?  It'll be interesting to see. 
[00:15:00]  That's dull.  That's not going into specifics.  I'd like to hear it.  Everyone.  I'll tell you, I used to be a Leslie Gold Radio listener, and I don't know what it is  with the show.  It just sucks now.  I actually stopped.  I'm glad Ron and Fez are on in the afternoon.  They're fantastic.  No one did well, okay?  No one.  All right.  Yeah, the whole station.  This guy's going to call us hypocrites.  We'll give him his time.  Steve, go ahead.  Guys, I'm a huge fan, but let's be real here.  If you were number one in the book, it would be the most accurate book in the world. 
[00:15:30]  No, not if we went from number seven to number one.  We would be like, next book, we're really going to take a hit because this isn't accurate.  Steve.  Yeah, but you know what?  Wait, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve.  I will sort of agree with you.  Yes, when the ratings work in your favor and you know they're not accurate, you're not going  to bitch as much.  Of course not.  Right.  Of course not.  But with that said, even though we took a major hit overall, we're still number one by 
[00:16:00]  far in all the demos we're supposed to do well in.  Yeah, well, you know what might help?  But the news and TV will never report that.  Of course not.  No, of course not.  Those guys are a-holes.  Honestly, if you want an accurate portrayal of what's going on with the radio station or  your favorite show, you have to do about three or four books.  Yeah, you also have to look at the advertising rates.  If they're going up, something's working.  You look at the three-book average and stuff because that's a little more accurate.  Yeah. 
[00:16:30]  All right.  Listen, I want to let you guys know that give it time.  You guys will be number one in the world.  In the world.  In the world.  All right.  We'll do that.  Thank you.  Okay.  All right.  We'll just gun for New York right now.  Yeah.  Randy.  Gentlemen.  Hey, Randy.  Listen, I understand the FBI is sending Fox Mulder to New York to investigate the disappearance  of your audience.  I think it's been an abduction.  Yeah, it's definitely an alien abduction.  All our listeners had barcodes on the back of their neck or something. 
[00:17:00]  I'm frightened.  I've been listening to you guys for a long time.  Suddenly, I'm getting radio signals in the back of my head.  Yeah, it happened.  All right, Randy.  Thank you.  Take care, guys.  Whatever.  But, I mean, you know, that has to be said today because the whole city's in an uproar.  Yeah.  This guy's over.  O&A dropped this much.  This station now sucks.  This station is now great out of nowhere.  Yeah.  Radio listening habits don't change that drastically.  The only time they do is if something major happens at that radio station.  I mean, major, like, let's say, Q104, which is like classic rock, okay? 
[00:17:30]  If all of a sudden they decided to throw an 80s music station at you, there would be some  great interest in that right off the bat.  So you would see a drastic increase in ratings, possibly, okay?  And then it would flatten out.  Or if your high-profile morning guy, or screw that, or your high-profile afternoon guys  or whatever, all of a sudden leave, then, yeah, you might see, you know, a drastic dip  in the audience.  But if your lineup's the same and you're pretty much doing the same thing at the station, 
[00:18:00]  30% of your audience is not going to say, you know, we now hate you after three months.  I just threw that one in there, right?  Jumbo.  Hey, boys.  Hey.  Are you telling me that Eddie Superstar is running NEW? 
[00:18:30]  Well, he's picking out the paint scheme.  The rain man of the airwaves, the guy that walks around with a wet sponge in his pocket  all the time.  We love Eddie.  I have to be very careful how we talk about it.  See, now it all makes sense, though.  Eddie picked the colors for the radio station.  Eddie, do you like this really ugly lime green color?  Yes, I do.  It is the worst color, too, man.  God help you all.  All right, man.  Be careful.  Bye. 
[00:19:00]  And no Jeremy and Ken today.  They don't really need to be around.  Oh, no?  No, this place runs itself.  Are they in Philly?  I don't even know.  We are so good, we don't even need management around.  Because I know the Philly ratings come out, right?  So maybe they just jump around until one of the stations they're in charge of is doing  well, and then they just sit there and celebrate for a while.  And then they camp out there for a while.  Oh, Philly's tanking.  Let's get to Washington.  Get me on the shuttle quick. 
[00:19:30]  Do we own any other stations we can fly to and see if it's doing well?  So we can feel good about ourselves?  All right.  And that's it.  Yeah.  Hank, what's going on?  Not much, guys.  Listen, long-time listeners, I started a business out here a year ago, stumbled across it.  I've been faithful to you ever since.  Right on.  But I've got to be honest.  You know, when the crash started going down in the beginning with the station, I didn't  hold it personally against you guys, but I shut the station off and I wouldn't go back  for a month and a half before I finally said, why am I boycotting them? 
[00:20:00]  It ain't the guys that are doing the program that I'm pissed off at.  It's the organization itself.  The way it came over, I mean, honestly, I got my own theories and my own opinions, but  I don't know what they did to everybody there.  But it wasn't right from listening to it.  Hank, I don't want to insult you, but that's just plain stupid.  Let me tell you what.  I agree.  I agree.  That's why it came back.  Let me explain something to you, okay?  This type of radio that the N.E.W. is trying to do where there's all these different shows,  you know, you should be loyal to the show and not the station, or you should be loyal to 
[00:20:30]  a few shows at the station and not the station.  That's why we always say we're an island, and that's why it's in our best interest when  we don't really intermingle, because then something happens on some other show and it  supposedly affects us.  You know, we don't need that.  So we just go about our business, and that's it.  You know how many shows have been around Anthony and I since we started three years ago?  I mean, I will give someone a homework assignment, and we'll give you a really good prize.  On the instant feedback, try to name all the people that have had full-time shifts here 
[00:21:00]  at W.E.W. since Anthony and I started three years ago.  It's mind-boggling.  And it's a shame, too.  Just recently, the sports guys, that's a whole new show now, officially.  Yeah.  It's the same name, but it's a whole new show.  And I'm not trashing those guys or anything, but, you know.  Yeah, the original sports guys, not there.  Not there anymore.  It started with Scott and Sid, right.  Both parties now gone.  Well, like I said, you know, I did wake up and realize that the stupidity on my end was, 
[00:21:30]  you know, missing out on dynamite radio.  Don't let your heads get too big, but dynamite radio only at the cause of upper management.  I mean, you do what you want, but, I mean, to punish yourself because, you know, management  is cool, it's just kind of stupid.  No, I agree.  I woke up and I realized it.  I mean, I've been back ever since.  And I've got to tell you something, too.  Wherever you guys go, I have turned on so many people to you.  I will follow you no matter what kind of BS anybody pushes through. 
[00:22:00]  You guys are dynamite.  No, we know that.  Thank you.  And I'm one of them older guys, 40.  I mean, it ain't that old, but I like to see the wows, too.  So the other guys that complain they don't get them because you're older?  Right.  Awesome out, man.  All right.  Thank you, Hank.  Guys, great job.  Keep it up.  All right.  Take care.  Bye.  But to boycott us because you don't like what management did to another show.  Yeah.  You know, that's not fair to us.  I mean, we work hard.  It doesn't seem like it, but we do.  Kind of silly.  So.  Yeah, we'll move on. 
[00:22:30]  We now move on.  Yeah, because that's a whole nother book.  That's going to bore people to death, but.  Yeah.  You know, I figured I needed to go on the air and explain to you guys how crazy it is  that, you know, audience shift that drastically in a three-month period.  Yeah, it doesn't matter.  And I'm not trying to protect Aunt Nye or the station, you know.  There's other shows, you know who I'm talking about, that took major, major hits, and it  just, it doesn't make sense. 
[00:23:00]  And the media, you know, should look into it a little bit if they want to tell the real  story.  The Demise.  Did you see that on the news?  I wish we could talk about it.  The Demise.  Did you see that on the news?  It's over.  The rain is over.  You know what they're talking about and stuff.  And it's like, come on.  It's ridiculous.  Believe me.  Impossible.  Thank you.  Just wait, watch, and see.  Now, if three books in a row happen, and we go down, like, you know, let's say 10%, and 
[00:23:30]  then another 10%, and then another 10%, oh, then we've got serious problems.  I'll be the first one to admit it to you.  Yeah.  That's that.  We'll move on.  It's the Whipped Cream Bikini Contest.  Yeah.  All this week on WNAW, on the ONA Show, and we're going to give you all the details next.  Grand Prize trip to Hawaii.  We have at least one lady here already, right?  To throw out the first Whipped Cream Bikini.  Nice.  We'll get into that next.

[00:34:00]  You guys are crazy.  All right, where are you?  Yeah.  So what's your name and where are you from?  Laura, I'm from a state of New York, Monticello.  Monticello?  Monticello.  It's up there.  We know where Monticello is.  Oh, yeah.  Isn't that...  It's a beautiful country.  Isn't that where, like, Thomas Jefferson had a house?  No, that's Monticello.  Oh.  No?  I'm not in Virginia.  No, who has, like, a house up there?  Stephen King owns a house in Monticello.  No, Monticello.  Who's there?  Who's famous that has...  That was from there, from history?  Like, president and stuff, right? 
[00:34:30]  There was, like, a president from there, right?  No.  That's Monticello.  That's Monticello.  Oh, that's in Virginia.  I always thought it was Monticello.  I always thought it was Monticello.  Yeah.  I think Washington or something slept there.  You're trusting a stripper on this history info.  Right?  Looks like she knows her history, right?  Yeah.  All right.  So you think you got a shout-out this trip to Hawaii?  Yeah, why not?  Can we see what you got going on under that dress?  You're a stripper and all, you know.  Well, you know.  Different.  What?  Why is this different?  I don't understand you, stripper. 
[00:35:00]  I don't get this.  Why is it different?  Well, because it's more of a, like, I don't know.  You want us to dim the lights and put some...  Some 80s hairband music on?  ...put some poison on or something?  I don't know.  What do you dance to?  Marilyn Manson.  Oh, there you go.  Yeah, I can see that.  I'm like a goth chick, right?

So you've been listening to us bitch for 10 minutes, and you think we're cool.  Well, I mean, the way that they run the radio station, everything, the way they say everything,  and the commercials are cool.  Oh, there you go.  Look at that.  And the wow thing, that's cool.  The commercials are cool.  Glenn, what's going on? 
[00:36:00]  Yeah, what's up, man?  I live in Monticello.  This girl couldn't possibly be good looking if she lives here.  Why is that?  All the girls up here are skanky looking.  Really?  The trippers and the trip clubs are bad looking.  They got the skank working?  Yeah, I live right near the racetrack there.  Where do you live, girly?  I live Hamilton Road.  Oh, yeah.  See, she's one of the ugly ones.  I can't wait to see her on the web.  Hey, Glenn, didn't the president live in Monticello?  No, that was Monticello, Virginia or something.  There's no way we can get around that.  Oh, you know who lives up here? 
[00:36:30]  She already said it anyway.  Spielberg's got a house.  Tyson's got a house.  There's a whole bunch of people who've got houses over here.  They're going to be selling the racetrack and make a gambling casino out of this.  No presidents, huh?  Sorry, boys.  I think there was a...  Forget about it.  I was going to make a bad joke.  Just hang up on me.  I thought that was Monticello.  Bye-bye, boys.  I thought people were saying it wrong.  Oh, man.  All right.  That's in Virginia?  Yes, Monticello.  No way.  It's called Monticello.  Isn't that on the back of a nickel?  I think it is. 
[00:37:00]  Say.  Say.  Go ahead.  That's where Thomas Shepperson's house is.  Yeah.  But that's Virginia.  I thought it was upstate New York.  I thought that's where he was banging the slaves and stuff.  No?  No?  They didn't have a plantation in Virginia?  They didn't have slaves in upstate New York back then?  Oh.  What about that president that went,  Bully!  Bully!  What about him?  Roosevelt.  Theodore Roosevelt. 
[00:37:30]  Wasn't he from New York?  Yeah.  He's got some...  There's old houses on Long Island somewhere.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're like a hoist of bed.  I don't recall, really.  I've never heard that.  All right.  Are you ready to get your whipped cream bikini out?  Sure am.  All right.  Cool.  All right.  What are you going to do?  I don't know.  What would you like me to do?  I don't know.  You've got to use your own creativity here.  Oh, my creativity.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  And now, you're going to be completely naked except for whipped cream.  I'm wearing my red high heels.  Red high heels.  Well, that's acceptable wear. 
[00:38:00]  Let me see the...  She's only got black boots on there.  Oh, okay.  All right.  So, why don't you get all dollied up outside, right?  Yeah.  Get all gussied up in your whipped cream.  And when you're done, we'll have you back in here.  And I'm wearing my thong, too.  Thong, thong, thong, thong.  Oh, are you?  Well, I don't have to.  No, actually, we don't like any underwear on.  We just want whipped cream on you.  Oh, okay.  That's it.  You got an ass for the thong?  Yes, actually.  Some of you girls, man, it's not flattering.  It makes your ass look long and flat.  Yeah, you know that? 
[00:38:30]  The girl's got to have the right ass.  Well, I don't know.  Yeah, sure you can.  There go the headphones.  I thought you didn't want to show us anything.  All right.  Oh, yeah, okay.  Well, don't pull that up too high, because that's when it goes bad.  Yeah, when the girls pull it up too high.  Right.  You got a very nice body.  A little white.  I like a little color in my women, but you're white.  That's okay.  She's almost as white as a paper. 
[00:39:00]  Yeah, I am.  Not quite Elmer's glue white.  A little darker.  All right.  Well, go have fun getting your whipped cream bikini on.  Yeah, go get that on.  The whipped cream supplied by Big Squeeze Juice and Cream, Anthony.  What the hell is that, Rick?  Big Squeeze Juice and Cream.  The guy that supplied us with five cases just for day one.  Where is it?  George.  Is anyone doing whippets with our whipped cream out there?  What's with a stripper that won't take her clothes off?  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Okay.  What's happening, man?  You're Big Squeeze Juice and Cream?  Yeah.  Big Squeeze Juice and Cream. 
[00:39:30]  That's a strange name for a company, man.  Well, the Big Squeeze part is the juice part.  We have the cream.  We figured...  I heard about the contest, so I figured we'd donate the cream.  It's pretty cool, but we'd like to be friends with the show.  The Big Squeeze, we're actually looking for distributors, so if anybody...  What is the Big Squeeze?  Is that the Big Squeeze?  Look, Derek, how many Tropicana lawsuits do you have on 10?  How many do you have 10?  There may be a problem with your product.  I thought this was Tropicana.  No.  That's the number one in America.  Have they tried to sue you yet for packaging? 
[00:40:00]  No, no.  There's a huge...  Well, they should.  That looks just like Tropicana.  That's the number one in America.  We would need to bring in some more.  Really?  Yes.  Now, we're looking for distributors for the juice.  But if you look at this from a distance, it looks like Tropicana.  And it's pesticide-free.  If you read it, they test it for pesticides.  They screen it.  I like some pesticides in my juice.  They actually screen it for pesticides.  Let's see this.  Really natural, good, pure, premium juice.  Not from concentrate.  Yes.  Pure premium juice.  There you go.  That's about half the price.  I don't like any concentrate. 
[00:40:30]  You're looking for distributors.  Cool.  Big Squeeze juice.  Mm-hmm.  Yep, distributors are looking for you.  If you want to be a distributor, we'll take you on the number 718-272-8860.  Right on.  Everybody's trying.  You got enough?  You need some more?  We'll grab some more?  Everybody tries.  Yeah, we'll try some.  I'll try some.  You got some vodka?  A couple cases.  And when do we get to spray the girls with the whipped cream?  Yes.  I'm looking to do this.  Well, we got one girl that has shown up so far.  Laura, right?  Yeah.  She said I could spray her.  Yeah, go have fun with her.  I remember cartons were a lot easier to open when I was a kid.  Now it leaves like a... 
[00:41:00]  Now you open it and it leaves like a hymen.  I got to break the hymen.  Did everybody get one?  Did everybody get a juice?  Yeah.  Mm.  We'll pass them around.  Oh, that's good juice.  There you go.  If you guys need juice, we'll always be there to drop it off.  It blows Topic out of the water.  Cool.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  All right.  We'll have you in from time to time.  That just develops.  Yeah, go ahead.  Yeah, 718-272-8860.  You got it.  Thank you, guys.  You got it, King Cullen, Grand Union.  Right.  And your local deli. 
[00:41:30]  My God, you're only supplying whipped cream.  Hello, I'm.  Thanks, guys.  Thanks, guys.  Mike, what's up?  Hello.  This is Nigel.  Hey, Nigel.  Did any of your DJs explode like our drummers did?  Joe Taggart was close to explode.  Joe Taggart, I remember, all that was left was a little green globule.  Yes, the green globules.  It was a flash of light, and then it was gone.  Yes, it was gone.  Joe Taggart was... 
[00:42:00]  Is Joe Taggart the shortest-lasting employee?  Uh, yeah.  Here with one show?  Maybe two.  Phew.  That was something.  That was something.  The ice cream cone PD.  Guys, I got Joe Taggart.  It's going to be great.  He's never done the radio by himself.  It's going to be great.  And then two days later, I don't think Joe's going to work out.  And he made it sound like it was Joe's fault.  It wasn't Joe's fault.  You pulled him out of a show he was doing with other people.  Throw him on the air.  I don't like him.  Look how high are you. 
[00:42:30]  She got him to get so.  It was great.  All right, we got to take a break.  Is that girl getting naked and getting her whipped cream on?  Yep.  Where is she doing that?  She's doing it right out here.  All right.  She is?  But she wouldn't take her clothes off in here.  She's retarded.  I kind of agree with you.  But a stripper knows more than us about Americanism.  She looks like a vampire.  That's scary.  I'm taking my clothes off.  Boo!  Speaking of stripping and stuff. 
[00:43:00]  Yeah.  I got a story to tell you.  Did you go stripping?  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Sandy went to Chippendale.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Who's she going?  I will talk to you about a double standard next.  Oh, no.  By the way, Linda was telling me about this.  They were trying to find something for the girls to go out to.  Linda went to?  She didn't go.  No.  Sandy was doing like a bachelorette part.  I have no problem with it.  See, Rick, not Linda.  But I will discuss the double standard next.  It's unbelievable.  And I'm sure there's a lot of guys out there that can relate to this. 
[00:43:30]  You want to hear the place they couldn't get into?  The place they were supposed to go, but they didn't book in time?  Hunkamania.  Just call it, come in, and I'll stick my C in your mouth.  Hunkamania.  All right, I'll tell you all about that anyway.  It's amazing.  Complete with pictures that I'm supposed to be cool looking at.  And I'm just thinking, I'll get into it next.  It's amazing.  Oh, Jesus.  It's absolutely amazing.  Trust me, I don't care, but the double standard part just blew me away this weekend. 
[00:44:00]  Oh, BNN today.  Who would you rather nail?  I disqualify myself because I've done them both.  Look at that wheel.  1-0-2-7-WNEW.  Anthony Pinnacle Horny Goat Weed.

[00:46:00]  Where were we?  I've got to hear now about Sandy going to Chippendale.  And why Rick's wife didn't go.  I can just picture him getting old pissed.  You ain't ever going.  You ain't going.  Get your Spanish blood up.  I did not.  Yeah, why?  Well, she doesn't know the girls at Sandy.  That never matters, though.  Yeah, no.  No, Sandy.  Right.  I've jumped on a bunch of bachelor parties because, you know, just because you know it's going to be fun.  Like, you don't know the guy. 
[00:46:30]  Who cares?  He's not going to care.  You know, one of his friends.  That's all it takes.  Right.  Well, you know what?  You're elbow deep in a hoo-ha.  So, uh...  Chippendales.  So, yeah, she had a weekend in the city with the girlies.  And they went to Chippendales for the bachelorette party.  And I'm hanging outside my house yesterday afternoon.  And she comes pulling up after her weekend in the city with a limp, I might add.  And a stiff neck. 
[00:47:00]  Swear.  Dude, from what?  Swear.  What'd she say it was from?  Because she was spinning around so much to take it all in, Anthony.  And she pulled a muscle in her neck.  A limp in it.  And I'm just laughing.  All right.  So, uh, so I'm sitting there on the porch enjoying a cold one.  And she goes, you want to see the pictures from, uh, from our night out? 
[00:47:30]  And I'm assuming she's just going to show me, you know, the safe pictures.  Right.  Here we are.  Maybe she showed me the whole, the whole roll.  Honestly, I don't care.  I really don't.  It's just funny because the things I saw in these pictures, I'm like, if I came home from a strip club, like privilege or something.  And it was just, it was, uh, it was just me with a bunch of girls touching me and stuff?  Yeah.  It's over, Johnny.  Yeah.  And every guy out there will admit the same damn thing.  All right.  So you're going to take pictures and I'm going, look at me, here's my face between these two huge cans. 
[00:48:00]  Right.  And I'm grabbing this chick's ass.  Right.  And she's got my junk.  She's trying to tell me it's different.  I'm like, all right, whatever.  So I'm going through the pictures.  First of all, I guess, uh, with the Chippendales thing, you know, the bachelorette parties and stuff,  I guess it's just, uh, just an insane scene.  Girls just losing their effing minds.  A lot of ladies that are really old, I guess.  Yeah.  Well, this is their way to get out.  Especially girls, uh, like the older women that you're talking about that don't really get any at home.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, they go out and go mad. 
[00:48:30]  All right.  So, uh, I guess, first of all, they carry you into the place.  What?  So you have, like, these, uh, naked, basically naked guys with ball bags on.  Yeah, they got the marble bag.  Can you imagine going to Privilege and, you know, one of the strippers carries you in?  I was just wearing a little G-string covering up for a hatch.  So the first picture I see is, um, she has to be a real big stripper.  So the first picture I see is Sandy in the arms of this huge, naked black guy. 
[00:49:00]  Whoa!  Huge.  A black guy bringing her in.  Huge.  The guy had to be at least 6'4".  Yeah.  At least.  A freak of nature.  He must have seen her walking and go, yeah, I'm going to pick her up.  Had a little bow tie and a ball bag.  That was it.  That's what they wear, the little bow ties with the little white collar.  Right.  Like, oh, where did my shirt go?  All that's left is the collar and the tie, and I'm completely naked.  And look at all the pimples on my body from all the steroids I do. 
[00:49:30]  Anyway, so they carry them in.  They carry them in.  Carry them in.  This is just strong.  Like how?  Like, like, a fireman's carry?  A cradle carry?  Pretty much, uh, just picture like a caveman, you know, deciding, you know.  A kind of cradle-mine.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  And that's how they take it to the seats, I guess.  Good, good.  I don't know if they do it for every woman.  And the seats are all men's faces.  Right.  I think it would be impossible, because there's got to be, uh, I don't know, a few hundred women in this club. 
[00:50:00]  I guess they all get carried in.  So I'm assuming, you know, they just carry the cute ones in, or the, uh, you know, the bachelorette party's in.  Yeah, because think, there's probably some real heifers.  Right.  That's like, I'm not carrying her.  So then I just see pictures of just, just, just, naked guys, basically, with their ball bags.  There's, there's pictures of Sandy dancing with all of them with their bachelorette party.  They're pulling on the G-string.  They got their dollars out.  They're basically drooling.  Now, I saw on HBO, a couple of times, you watch the real sex, or some of those sex shows, and they show the women in, uh, Chippendales, or comparable places. 
[00:50:30]  And the guys that are wearing the, uh, uh, ball bag, um, marble bag things, it's almost like a banana hammock.  And they're, like, thrusting forward and backward, so this thing is jiggling in the girl's face.  Right, in their face!  Well, you know what?  Yeah, pretty much just leaving bruises on their chin with their jump. 
[00:51:00]  But you know what?  I don't, I don't really care.  I really don't.  All right.  No, I really don't.  If, you know, if San and her friends want to go out and do that, that's fine.  And if they want to take pictures, that's fine.  But I'm sitting there, like, looking at these pictures, going, if I brought the same pictures home, there'd be hell to pay.  Oh, my God.  Hell to pay.  And I'm like, what is the difference?  She goes, oh, the difference is, you know, they don't really touch you or anything, but in a strip club, the girl's boobs, they're in your face when you, when they do their lap dances and stuff.  So as a typical guy, I'm like, uh, no, they don't, they don't, they don't do that. 
[00:51:30]  No.  And then she's, she's like, who are you kidding?  I, I got one of these lap dances and I had the boobs in my face.  Girls get different lap dances from strippers.  And I'm like, oh, yeah, I was there, I forgot about that.  But girls get different lap dances from strippers than guys get.  Yeah, because the girls really work it because they know the girls are uncomfortable.  And the girls are allowed to touch the strippers for some bizarre reason.  With the guys, here's the lap dance a guy gets.  Sit down, pretty much, it's a reenactment of the electric chair.  Strap in, put your arms on the side. 
[00:52:00]  They might as well just put the metal bolts over them.  Right.  Because you're not allowed to, uh, even brush the thigh or nothing.  The cuffs come up from the, uh, the arms of the chair.  Locks you in.  Don't touch or a rock go over there is going to pound your face in.  So I'm like, at the nicer clubs, there is no touching.  None whatsoever.  Hey, at the other places, you know.  Well, who knows what goes on in the champagne room.  Yeah, don't go to the champagne room.  So I'm just going through picture after picture with, you know, just these girls just losing 
[00:52:30]  their effing mind over these guys with pimples on their freaking shoulders.  Greg from Lynn, uh, asking, uh, is there such thing as male body glitter?  Yeah, it's called jizz.  I want to come home with that on you.  Come home with that male body glitter on you.  Uh, let's go to John.  John, what's going on?  Yeah, listen, I was, uh, I saw that HBO special that, uh, Anthony was talking about.  It wasn't, you know, these guys were hung like animals. 
[00:53:00]  Yeah.  It wasn't a baby's arm with an apple.  It was Mark McGuire's arm holding a candle.  And they were destroying these black ones with their drums.  Slamming it in the face and in the back.  Like, it was insane.  And like, the guys into a bag.  Oh, there he is.  Because the, uh, the, the ball bag things they wear weren't just ball bags.  Right.  They, they, uh, fit around the guy and look like an elephant's trunk.  Right.  And they're smacking the girls in the face with these things.  Come on.  Bill, what's going on? 
[00:53:30]  I work in the Savoy in the Bronx.  I'm a bouncer.  They hand out condoms.  And you see what these women do with them.  They hand out condoms to the ladies?  They hand out condoms and they just lift up their shirts and the guys just put it in.  This, come on.  Oh, man.  Yo, I'm sorry to you.  I, I, I don't know if I believe that one.  Well, you see, it's going to be a lot of guys calling up.  It's in the Savoy in the Bronx.  Right.  All right.  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  Is it true that the guy that I carry Sandy in, he had no arms? 
[00:54:00]  Is that true?  Jerry.  Hey, what's going on?  Hey, man.  Hey, Oak, did you put a black light up to your girl when she came home that night?  A black light.  Oh, my God.  I didn't need to.  She had the stiff neck and she walked with a lift.  Like one of those hotel sheets.  You do the math.  The math.  Thanks, guys.  You do the math.  You do the math.  You turn on the black lights.  You look like a Peter Max painting.  God damn.  Oh, that's awful. 
[00:54:30]  But there is a huge double standard like that.  Right.  Because the guys can't, you can't even say you went to these places.  A lot of guys, married guys, they have to lie and say they went to somewhere else with  the guys when they went for a quick beer after work at the strip club or something.  Meanwhile, the girls are announcing that they're going for weeks and they go with all their  friends and then they come back with these war stories.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, guys, next time you're in a strip club, you know, bring a camera, take pictures and  then show them to your wife or girlfriend and see the reaction you get. 
[00:55:00]  You'll never get out of there alive, first of all, if you're snapping pictures.  True.  The big biker guy will kill you.  Nick, what's going on?  Hey, guys, my girlfriend was at that last night.  I can't believe you guys are talking about it.  Was the MC, like, really tall or something?  I honestly don't know.  It was a couple days ago now, I guess.  She comes home at one in the morning, tells me how much she missed me and how sexy I am.  Come on, I feel like a hobbit.  Who are you kidding over here, you know?  You know what?  I'll tell you what I was hoping for, though.  You know, these places get the women sexed up.  I'm thinking I'm going to, you know, I'm going to reap the benefits. 
[00:55:30]  I'm just glad she went to a place where HBO filmed it.  Now millions of people are going to know, in addition, whether my girlfriend's a hoe or not.  Right on.  What's it filming?  What's it on the I mean?  What?  The HBO special.  I don't know.  I don't know.  It is.  Damn it, man.  Thanks, Nick.  All right.  Yeah, I was hoping to reap the benefits.  I'm like, all right, she's all sexed up seeing these animals.  What happened?  With these sculptured bodies and stuff.  I'm like, all right, she's going to be all sexed up a little more than usual.  Did you get some?  All right.  I'm like, I can't even reap the benefits of this. 
[00:56:00]  So then my sick brother.  Come on, crime scene.  Well, that's what I'm going to say.  My sick brother, Brad, who came up with the term crime scene sex, he goes, you got to do  the crime scene sex.  You got to.  You got to.  Didn't do the crime scene sex.  Dude, come on.  Why not?  Didn't do it.  My brother loves the crime scene sex.  Loves it.  What's wrong with the crime scene sex?  Loves it more than regular sex. 
[00:56:30]  Why is it so much worse that you're doing it during that time than not?  I don't see a problem with it.  I'm not a big fan of that to begin with.  Maybe a little.  Yeah.  Without getting to graphic, fine.  But a little.  I mean, there's been some instances I know where I got home from a hotel room and the  police bashed down my door.  Housekeeping call.  Someone had to die in this bed. 
[00:57:00]  They need a body.  That's crime scene sex.  They need a body.  John, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How are you?  I've been told you, Screener.  I worked two years with Chippendales.  And six and a half years with the Billy Deans All Mail Review out in Long Island.  Billy Deans?  Yeah.  Oh, Billy Deans.  Yeah, that's kind of like low-budget Chippendales.  Uh-huh.  And the reason I was let go from Chippendales, you know, I won't use my last name because  there is litigation with about eight or nine guys.  It's a group, Clairfaction Lawsuit Against the Company, was because we weren't doing things 
[00:57:30]  so on and so forth in the back room or in that champagne room with girls because everybody  got a piece of it, if you know what I mean.  Uh-huh.  So you also do get measured by your junk.  It's kind of like, you know, Dirk Diggler, let me see what you got type of thing.  Boo!  What are you complaining?  And if you don't train hard and keep your body, you wind up getting really big parts  and crappy parts.  And, you know, I was engaged and that broke up, needless to say.  Were you just banging all the time?  You know, to be honest, I did in the beginning of the first year because I was young and it 
[00:58:00]  was new.  See, that's...  And it was fun.  I think that's the difference, too, because most of the female strippers don't want to,  like, sleep with the patrons.  I mean, please, I don't think you'd find one of them.  All right.  But I'm being polite.  I'm sure there's a few.  But I think you guys, the male strippers out there, John, you guys are like, you know...  It's a whole different mentality with us.  Yeah, you guys want to get some action.  Like, you know the deal.  If a girl does a lot of guys, she's a whore.  If a guy does it, he's got a headdress full of feathers, you know? 
[00:58:30]  But that's the whole thing, too.  If there's a chick there, if there's a chick that goes to one of these things and she wants  to get nailed, there's these guys, the dancer guys, that are going to oblige.  But if there's a guy who's all horned up and he goes into these strip clubs, odds of  him walking out with one of the strippers?  Please.  Yeah, right.  Please.  That's their whole gig.  That's the whole gig is draining the pockets of the guys that think they got a shot at one  of these chicks.  That's that.  Hey, John.  Hey, guys.  They put me through dental school and I have an office. 
[00:59:00]  It's right here on 300 Comac Road in Comac.  Right on.  And you're on every night in my office.  John, really fast, though.  Go ahead.  How bad do you have to fake you when there's just a pig in front of you?  Oh, my God.  I was going to bring that up also.  You get these women and you say, my God, this is a bachelorette party.  Who in God's name is marrying her next Saturday, you know?  And you get violently ill.  They touch you.  They shove the dollary in the back and their fingers go up certain spots.  And you're like, oh, God, you know? 
[00:59:30]  And it's a big joke backstage where, you know, you come out and you've got to be real serious.  But it's just, it's complete, it's a mockery with us backstage as to what we're going to  do when we come out, you know?  Were you a cop, a fireman, or an astronaut when you came out?  Did you wear one of the costumes?  The cowboy, the cowboy vest.  Oh, you are so cheesy.  How did you go there, huh?  How many of you guys are gay?  You know what?  It was kind of strange.  There was two different cliques. 
[01:00:00]  There was the guys you knew who were gay.  They did a lot of the road stuff.  A lot of the stuff where they went away and dressed up and went to the woman's house or  the restaurant or the, you know, the village hall, whatever they had it, you know, the  vet's center.  But you, I did it on the side.  Women as old as 70.  And then they, you would do backyard parties and feel just so cheap.  You know?  I can remember one house.  The guy constantly requested myself and two other guys.  I'm used to hearing a girl say that she feels so cheap.  I've never heard a guy say, oh, I felt so cheap. 
[01:00:30]  Well, there was this rich couple out in West Hampton, and she would be able to handpick  our three or four guys, and he would pick his three or four, and halfway through this  big beach party, they would separate out of the beach, and women would just use it,  and the men would use the girls, you know, from a different agency.  Yeah.  And we made a lot of money that guys fought for that party.  Nice.  But like I said, it put me through dental school, so, and I'm happily married with two kids.  All right, John.  Thank you.  You guys are great, man.  Take care of yourselves.  All right, buddy.  Bye-bye.  Bye.  There you go.  There's a couple more interesting calls coming in here.  Let's go to JJ. 
[01:01:00]  JJ, what's up?  Make it fast.  Yo, what's up, Bob?  Hey.  My girlfriend did the same thing this weekend, kid.  Yeah?  She went to a strip club.  She came home.  She's like, oh, you want to see the pictures?  I'm like, no thanks.  I couldn't even get there, I think, because she had a freaking period.  What the hell's happening here?  Well, they sync up, Anthony.  Is that it?  Pretty much, there's a...  I would say over 50% of the women walking around Manhattan right now are having their time of the  month.  Yeah?  Oh, yeah.  They sync up.  How about... 
[01:01:30]  When girls work together, they sync up.  Yeah, sure, man.  All right, Jay.  Thank you.  Bye.  Bye.  Let's go to Dave.  Dave, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Hey.  Two years ago, I picked my wife up at a bachelor party at 4 o'clock in the morning because  her and her buddies were too loaded to drive home.  She gets in the car.  First thing she says to me is, I kissed a boy.  Yeah.  I kissed a boy.  Can you imagine?  You reverse the situation.  She picks me up drunk at 4 o'clock in the morning.  Right.  I kissed one of the strippers.  Exactly. 
[01:02:00]  She would behead you.  Next morning, I did.  I told her next morning what she said.  She didn't remember it.  Yeah.  But I used that one for months.  Ah, it's cool, man.  The girls should do all that stuff.  It's a double standard, you know?  Yeah, but I used that.  I want to talk about the double standards all the time.  They got one on us here.  They're allowed to take the pictures and kiss boys and stuff at these places.  Yeah, but you let them get away with it, and then you can do what you want.  You can dine out on that for months.  Right.  All right, Dave.  Thank you.  Bye.  That's good.  Ryan.  Yeah, what's up, man?  I see Greg Brady out there, and I see a midget.  Oh, no.  That guy's just on his knees? 
[01:02:30]  Oh, it'll be Barry Williams.  Barry Williams.  We're going to talk to him in a minute.  Ryan.  Hey, what's up, man?  Yeah, my girl went like a couple weeks ago with a friend, and it's just funny because  they just like keep up my pictures, and they just act like they just look like animals,  man.  I know what you're saying about the double standard, though.  You know, it's like it's all right for them to like get yam bags from those that shit,  but, you know, we can't look at some boots.  They get crazy and stuff, but then the whole time it's usually, oh, the strip clubs, you  know, ah, it's disgusting, and the guy's going in there and doing this, that. 
[01:03:00]  Meanwhile, like you said, they just lose their effing mind when they go in there.  I think they pump in nitrous.  All right, folks.  Thanks, Ryan.  I'm glad that you had a good time.  It's just funny that they get big pictures and stuff, and it's normal.  Oh, God.  Dominic.  Yes.  Hey.  Nails in.  I've been doing it for about five years.  All I've got to say is there's no comparison to the way women act and the way men act at  these places.  The women just totally get nuts.  Men have to basically just sit there.  There's bouncers everywhere, you know, and for us, when we do these shows, there's really 
[01:03:30]  enough bouncers anywhere to watch our backs.  Right.  But these women can just go basically wild, bring scissors in, and they can pretty much  like, you know, outlastically cut our G-strings off, which is what happens.  Wait a minute.  What?  They bring scissors in?  They bring scissors.  They bring scissors in, they hide them, and when you're not looking, they actually  try to cut your G off, your junk.  You know what?  If you did that, if a guy did that in a strip club...  Forget it.  We arrested.  Arrested?  Arrested.  You'd never make it out. 
[01:04:00]  You'd be lucky if you were still walking by the time they threw you out to the sidewalk  cutting your colon.  Imagine you have a scissor in a strip club.  Hey.  It's like 10 bikers.  They take it out of their pocketbooks.  All right.  That's funny, Dominic.  All right, man.  You guys take care.  Everyone's going to mess up on the rig.  I'm sorry.  Tony, you're next on WNAW.  What's up, ONA?  Two quickies.  One, I know some of these guys that dance.  They work out of my gym.  Yeah.  Best excuse?  Oh, I got all these pimples from tanning.  Okay?  And this is like three out of four of them are black eyes. 
[01:04:30]  All right.  Two.  Dude, my ex-girlfriend used to go to strip bars all the time.  Arrested, you got your standards.  You know, the body glitter, the lipstick, all of that crap.  She comes home four in the morning.  She smells like a bottle of tropical coconut oil.  Uh-oh.  I'm like, okay.  Yeah, what'd you do?  Go to a 24-hour tanning booth, you stank?  Hey.  We do half of that crap.  We die.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She's just having fun.  Dude, these guys got a call in.  They got horror stories. 
[01:05:00]  Women with the press on nails going into the unknown.  Right, right.  They actually try to poke a finger in.  Dude, oh.  Oh, my God.  They think they automatically have carte blanche to be partologists.  Guys with scratches, dashes on them.  These women are out of their minds.  We pull this.  We're in the alleyway sucking food out of a straw for the rest of my life.  That's true.  Thanks, Tony.  Go ahead, fellas.  I told you to stay out of here.  A couple more and we'll move on.  Day, it looks like.  Day?  Yeah.  What's up?  Yo, listen.  I had this. 
[01:05:30]  Well, I was married a couple of years ago, right?  And these strippers broke up my marriage, man.  I was sitting up there and she said she's going to some bachelor party.  So I let her go.  You know, black dress party, whatever.  Hang out.  I'm a big 70s fan or whatever.  And I have blacklight posters in my room.  Yeah.  She came home, you know, with the spandex on.  She's like, oh, I had a good time or whatever.  Drunk as hell.  And as she's walking to the bathroom, there's a damn stain in the back of her pants, man.  Wait a minute.  Like that was glowing under the blacklight?  Yeah.  I didn't know about it.  And she didn't know about it either.  And I'm like, what the hell is that? 
[01:06:00]  And she's like, oh, nothing.  Somebody spilled the drink on it.  So I told my friends about it and they told me what shows up with the blacklight.  Went home.  Marriage is over.  That's funny.  That's not funny.  That's horrible, man.  That's funny, man.  All right.  Going in is the best.  See you later.  All right.  That's really good.  I love the strip clubs, Tony.  I go to Chippendales.  Helps me take my mind off the ass cans.  I bring the scissors.  I try to play grab bag.  I love them, Tony.  Lisa.  Hey, what are you doing? 
[01:06:30]  Your fiancée works at Hunkamania?  He works at Hunkamania.  Nice.  And I've been to many shows at Hunkamania, Chippendales, and the whole nine yards.  Hunkamania.  And I have to say, it's totally, totally different.  There are crazy ladies at these shows.  He does come home scratched and buttons torn off his shirt and stuff like that.  They do get nuts.  But nothing's allowed to go on like at a strip bar where girls dance.  See?  This is a fallacy.  Totally.  I worked at a strip club. 
[01:07:00]  I'm at a dance.  I worked as a hostess.  Totally, totally different.  No way.  From what you see these girls do, as opposed to if you go to, like, Hunkamania, there's  no private room.  There's no champagne room.  They don't carry, like you guys said, they don't carry all these girls in.  There are some pretty hefty girls that could not even be lifted.  So...  Look, I've never, I have never gone into a private room.  I've never gone into the champagne room.  If I've been to a strip club, it's sitting there at the bar or whatever. 
[01:07:30]  You're drinking some beer and you throw some dollars at the girls.  They sit on your lap.  No.  They put the boobs in the face.  Oh, I don't like this strip of smells.  You're getting on me.  It's totally different, you know, what a girl than it's for guys.  Meanwhile, they're grabbing man ass and shaking genitalia in their face.  Right in front of everybody, though.  It's not, it's more of like a theatrical show.  It's a theatrical show when the guys dance.  Oh, God. 
[01:08:00]  You know something?  Your boyfriend does this?  Yeah.  That's why you have this whole take on it.  It's so you can rationalize it the way you do.  He's in Aida, Opie.  He's on Broadway.  He's doing Jekyll and Hyde.  A boyfriend's doing Jekyll and Hyde.  Speaking of Aida.  And they're sneaking...  He took Aida?  No, Aida, Tony.  And they're sneaking scissors in and stuff?  Okay.  Yeah.  Anyway, guys, love you.  All right.  Bye-bye. 
[01:08:30]  He comes on with scratches and buttons ripped off.  But, you know, it's a play.  He's doing the Lion King.  She rationalized it.  Daniel, those girls are getting a lot more than guys are getting.  Here's a reference for you, fellas.  Here you go.  Right?  I think Opie's fear of the crime scene sex stems back to the bloody Honda seat.  Well, pretty much.  I don't know what the hell was going on with that girl.  I think she was having an abortion in my place here.  That was no...  Have a good one, you guys.  You guys suck. 
[01:09:00]  When you were DJing and you walked in and the black light showed the big blood stains on  your pants.  Huge.  And that had to go...  That had to go through her...  That had to go through her panties, her jeans.  No way.  There was something going on there, man.  Wow.  Hello?  My strong's a hanger.  Jeff.  Yo, O&A.  Rip it out.  What's up?  Hey, Jim. 
[01:09:30]  Can you hear me?  Yeah.  All right.  I'm on.  You can't say yes.  All right.  Go ahead.  I'm sorry.  I'm on a bad cell.  I'm going to go back to your story of the body glitter at the strip club.  Yeah.  I got something worse than that.  We're at a stag party.  And, you know, I was thinking of your stories about coming home with the body glitter.  A buddy of mine was getting a lap dance.  The girl was, you know, totally naked.  And all of a sudden, she looks down and she goes, oh, my God.  And she runs into the bathroom.  Oh, you don't even... 
[01:10:00]  We can figure out what it was.  Wow.  The jeans were all red.  How do you explain that?  I came upon an accident.  I saved a life.  Everybody said, everybody said, tell them you dropped some pasta marinara on your pants.  Oh, I'll lick that off, honey.  It was pretty funny, though.  You know, we turned tragedy into comedy.  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  Bye.  Oh, my God. 
[01:10:30]  Look at this one.  I wonder if this is true.  We're trying to move on, but the stories are getting better on the phone lines.  Morgan.  Morgan.  Hey.  Morgan.  Oh, wait, he's got a...  Holy ass.  He's got a custom.  Oh, is that what he was doing?  Okay.  Cool.  Okay.  Hello?  Hey.  What are you telling?  Hey, I'm at work.  Where do you work?  I'm at Tampa.  I'm at MTV at the moment.  At Tampa.  At MTV.  Nice.  What's going on at MTV today?  Not much.  No.  So, I heard you guys discussing this whole stripper thing, and I got married in October, 
[01:11:00]  and I went to a bachelor party, and my wife-to-be went to a bachelor party.  And after we all came back, she brought back pictures her friend took, and, you know, she  told me nothing happened, whatever.  I see the pictures.  She gives them to me to develop.  I see the pictures, and they got her...  One guy's got her shirt pulled up over her breath, and he's got his mouth all over  her breath.  Oh, my God.  He had his mouth on her boobs.  Yeah.  Not bare-breast, but, you know, her bra was there still, but still.  Wow.  We got into a whole big fight about this, because at my bachelor party, I didn't want 
[01:11:30]  to do anything.  My friends were there.  One of my friends was taking pictures.  You know what?  I've got to say, I don't think you should get in a fight.  And there's definitely a double standard involved, I mean.  All right.  Not to say that at strip clubs for guys, it's not some crazy things that go on there as  well, but the women do go a little berserk.  The bachelor party's over.  Yeah, bachelor party.  That's where it goes crazy with the guy.  You know, not at strip clubs.  If a guy wants to go to a strip club, that's one thing.  Bachelor parties are insane.  And I'm not saying everybody goes crazy at the bachelor party, but there are a few people 
[01:12:00]  that will go lose their effing minds at a bachelor party.  You see the coolest things at bachelor parties.  I have seen guys that will do a chick that I swear to God, you wouldn't do with a frigging  one of those pool skimmer things.  I just got awful.  Hey, Bobby, you're up.  Oh.  Owens Mail Strip Club.  Owen A.  Want us to send some up there.  No.  What? 
[01:12:30]  That was Owens Mail Strip Club.  No.  Don't make these decisions too hasty.  Larry.  Yeah.  What's up, guys?  Hey, man.  Listen, you just brought back bad memories.  Yeah.  I used to be a limo driver.  And on a Saturday night, my boss said, listen, there are three bachelorette parties, and you  got to go on one of them.  And I said, fine.  I get the limo.  I wash it, gas it up, get to the address.  A bunch of girls come out, and I recognize two of them. 
[01:13:00]  My sister-in-law, who's getting married, and my wife.  I had to drive them to a strip club.  Oh, God.  And for five hours, I was waiting for them.  I was starving.  I'm trying to go in and tell my wife and my sister-in-law, guys, come out.  I got to eat.  Right.  The bouncer wouldn't let me in.  He says, you can't go in.  You're not a husband now.  You're a driver.  Right.  He says, you got to wait until they finish enjoying themselves.  Me and my wife haven't spoken for three days after that. 
[01:13:30]  I was pissed.  All right, Larry.  Thank you.  All right, buddy.  Peace.  All right.  I think we're done.  Yeah.  We'll try one last call, and then we've got to get Barry Williams in here.  Yes.  The real Greg Brady, of course.  Of course.  Benny.  Hey, guys.  How are you?  Good.  Three years ago, I was engaged for about a month, and our engagement party, we took a  bunch of rolls of film.  Well, about five months later, I said to my fiancee, we were living together, what's with all the  rolls of film in the junk drawer in the kitchen?  She says, oh, they're just miscellaneous. 
[01:14:00]  Why don't you go and develop them?  So I go over to Costco, and I pay to have them done.  I pick them up four days later.  I'm with my mother in my Jeep.  She says, did you see these pictures?  And I said, yeah, they're at the engagement party.  She shows me one with Melissa, while at the time my fiancee, laying back in the arms of this  big 250-pound bodybuilder black guy.  And he's got both of his hands, and I remember the clothes she wore that night, down the  front of her black spandex pants.  Oh, man. 
[01:14:30]  Both his hands, I mean, down, like they were down in between her legs.  He was grabbing her patch.  And I know for a fact she wore on a wonderweight that night, because she said to me, oh, don't  make a big deal about it.  Right.  Well, that led to a conversation which led to her, telling me I didn't trust her, and  then she left.  There you have it.  I didn't trust her.  There you have it.  You guys got it.  Take care.  And listen, Greg Brady rules.  All right, cool.  What other situation can you be in?  What did that guy just say?  That his girlfriend...  I have no idea, and I'll tell you why.  Nick from Penthouse has walked down the hall with the sickest-looking blonde I've ever seen 
[01:15:00]  in my life.  By sick, you mean?  Just insane body.  Look at this girl.  Hold on.  We'll get to her next.  Just peek your head in for a sec.  All right, we'll talk to you in a minute, okay?  Look at that.  Something tells me she's in Penthouse.  Yes.  How much does she live?  I need to be carried around for a little while.  Carried around.  I was saying really quickly, what other situation can you be in where you're either engaged  or married or something?  Yeah.  And, all right, I'm going to go to a room where they play loud music and touch somebody 
[01:15:30]  of the opposite sex in their private areas.  Because that's what it is.  Why can't you just say, hey, I'm going to go into the bedroom here.  I'm going to play some loud music and flashing lights and just touch somebody of the opposite  sex.  Why?  Because it's a place called Chippendales.  It makes it okay.  It's okay.  Sure.  It doesn't make sense.  All right, we've got to take a break.  Barry Williams is here.  Yes.  And a girl's showing up like crazy for the whipped cream bikini contest. 
[01:16:00]  We have at least another three or four girls out there, right, Stig?  Yes.  Oh, my God.  Quick, we've got to get Greg Brady in here.  Then he's probably fouling all of them.  Is there a, is that other girl in her whipped cream bikini yet?  And have we taken her pictures?  Laying down right now.  Oh, all right.  We'll take a break.  We'll be back.

May I have your attention, please?  Marsha, Marsha, Marsha. 
[01:19:00]  I repeat, may I have your attention, please?  Will the real Greg Brady please stand up?  That's me, of course.  Barry Williams.  Great, Brady.  Barry Williams.  Great, Brady.  Barry Williams.  Uh-oh.  We're going to have a problem here.  Y'all act like you've never seen a real Brady before.  Bell bumps, Polly Huster, headband, orange hair.  Was it permed?  Was it real?  Hey, who doesn't care?  Here's the story.  Here's the story of a guy named me.  Greg Brady.  Barry Williams.  Don't you know we were the real that 70s show?  And oh, Alice O prepared Sam Smith for free.  You know what I mean.  It's the return of Johnny Bravo.  Wait. 
[01:19:30]  No, wait.  He didn't just say what I said.  He did, did he?  And Mike Brady said, nothing, you idiots.  Like Tiger, he's dead.  And he had a little Greg Brady.  I'm sick of him looking at him, walking around, wearing his kiki god, surfing and wiping out.  Yeah, but he's so cute, though.  He's cool for a while being a teenage star, but now the Brady name can only go so far.  I'm doing stuff that's new, but I'm Greg Brady, too.  Football into Marsha's nose, sing the chorus, and it goes.  I'm Greg Brady, it's not the real Brady.  All the other Greg Bradys are just irritating.  So if you ain't Greg Brady, please shut up. 
[01:20:00]  Please shut up.  Please shut up.  Because I'm Greg Brady and I did ladies more than anything.  Brady should stop.  You're imitating.  Yes, I'm the real Greg Brady.  I grew up.  I grew up.  Please shut up.  It was so much fun.  Make that show for you.  Didn't write my book, too.  Telling you who to date and who.  It was all TV.  Wasn't real.  Just play fact.  Then you couldn't say that the dad was really gay or that my mom on TV was dating me.  Tee-hee.  It was groovy.  Far out.  Out of sight.  But any night you light up a TV and then you see some wannabe trying to be me. 
[01:20:30]  Greg.  Just be sure you know there ain't no show without me.  Barry Williams, Johnny Brock.  Greg Brady.  The Casanova.  Greg Brady.  Of Clinton Avenue.  Greg Brady.  I got AKAs coming out the wazoo.  I dig M&M and Clark bars, too.  I was the oldest kid and I was young and cute.  I would never do tootin' I stood with that suit.  I'm here to stay and if you get in my way, you can cram it where there ain't no sunshine day.  I'm Greg Brady and I'm the real Brady.  All the other Greg Grady's are not syndicated.  So if you ain't Greg Brady, please shut up.  Please shut up.  Please shut up. 
[01:21:00]  Because I'm Greg Brady and I did ladies more than anything.  Greg Brady, I was slim and shady.  You ain't Greg Brady.  Please shut up.  Don't suck up.  Please grow up.  I gotta get out of this time warp.  And how did I get stuck in this box in the upper right-hand corner anyway?  I was a kid of rock when Kit Rock was just a kid.  And Uncle Cracker was somebody's nephew.  I'd love to stay.  I gotta go because something suddenly came up. 
[01:21:30]  Whoa!  Wow!  Whoa!  Yeah!  Wow!  I'm exhausted.  Standing up!  Wow!  Wow!  Damn!  He just did that live.  Barry Williams, of course, and he's in the studio on 1027 WNAW.  Barry, what's going on?  It's always nice to come down here.  Yeah.  I don't even know why I'm here exactly.  I'm not pushing anything.  I'm not plugging anything.  I have nothing to sell.  You just want to hang.  Well, I picked up.  You always, always have me on the best day.  Yeah.  I mean, I just hit the lobby outside and I almost didn't want to come in.  I mean, there's some kind of excitement going on out there. 
[01:22:00]  Well, we're going to bring all those fine ladies in the studio in a few minutes.  They're in various states of undress, lovely figures, lovely personalities.  The girls are getting nicer as the day goes on, too.  We know you like the naked chicks.  It is true.  I was trying to wrangle a can of that whipped cream out of that guy's hand, but he wasn't  going for it.  No?  He wants to do his own artistic expression.  Yeah, I know.  Well, we'll have you apply one of the bikinis on one of these girls.  I think definitely.  That are a little more open to you doing that.  I think the one that came in looking like she's just got off the plane from California.  Oh, that's the penthouse pet. 
[01:22:30]  Oh, is that the penthouse pet?  You see?  She's the runner-up pet of the year.  She's like the vice president of the penthouse.  The runner-up is good.  The pet of the year gets assassinated or something.  She takes over the duty.  You know, I need to see the pet of the year because if this is the runner-up, oh my God.  Yeah, and the runner-up always tries harder, don't you think?  Yeah.  Right away, I've got to ask you, I heard something on the news.  Is there a new Brady show coming out?  Oh, man.  You know, just when we think we put that thing to rest.  Yeah.  You know? 
[01:23:00]  The movies, every time something's come around, you think this has to be the end.  When they did the second movie, a very Brady sequel, you figured that had to kill the  franchise.  Right.  And then I pushed it a little bit again last year when I did Growing Up Brady for NBC.  You pushed it a little bit.  But at least I was a real people.  And that girl was 15 years old in the blue bikini, right?  I know.  That was a shame on all of us.  It was so good.  You should have been on the set.  You're filthy.  I know.  We were all in the swimming pool with our snorkel and our masks on. 
[01:23:30]  Making sure the shot's right.  Yeah, making sure the shot was right.  Yeah, set up right.  Sure.  Everything was lit and magnified.  It was very good.  Very bad, very wrong.  But, you know, what the heck.  All right.  Now I read in Variety, and this apparently has been sold, I think, according to Variety.  Okay.  Fox Network, so you know where we're headed.  That Sherwood's horse's son, Lloyd, and he's trying to take over the franchise.  I've seen all that behind the Bradys and stuff.  But the one thing that this is crazy, the one thing that Sherwood had always said, that 
[01:24:00]  he wanted all of his kids, his Brady kids, to be real people.  You know, not like a nerd, and one person was into, you know, just into beauty or just  in, you know, like cardboard characters.  Yeah.  So that's why we all became, you know, all-American everybody.  Now this new concept, I understand, it's a little, kind of high-minded.  High-minded.  So you can follow this.  Bob, this is young, all-new Brady's, young Brady's.  All-new Brady's.  All-new Brady's.  Right.  Because everyone's young, like we all were.  Oh, back, it's going to be back where it was.  Right.  All right. 
[01:24:30]  I don't know what year it'll be set.  It could be in this millennium.  Isn't that bizarre?  Would they all get in a time machine?  I don't know what happened.  All right.  So they, but Bobby, youngest boy Bobby, finds a raffle ticket worth about $64 million.  $64 million.  And he doesn't know, of course he wants to cash it.  But Mike Brady, dad, says, he gives him one of his good father's turn lectures, and says,  no, no, no, we have to try and find the rightful owner.  Of course, same thing you guys had to do with the wallet, which they wrote.  That's how you found it in the ball field.  Well, why, you know, why think of a new idea? 
[01:25:00]  And so, so, so, so they find the rightful owner, and they return it, and there's a little  news article about that.  Then Mike Brady, it's coincidentally, at the same time, the President of the United States.  Is Mike Brady still gay?  Not in this.  He wasn't gay in the show.  No, no.  That's in the next millennium.  So then, so then he, so the President of the United States is looking for a running  mate, and he wants someone that's honest and with integrity, and Mike Brady fits the bill.  Oh, brother. 
[01:25:30]  So they run, and the President wins, and Mike Brady is now the Vice President.  Then the President is forced out of office.  Mike Brady becomes...  The President, Mike Brady.  The President!  See, I heard it totally different.  The story that they had on the news was completely bastardized.  It was, it was now, where you guys are all the ages you are now, and you won the lottery  thing and gave it to some charity. 
[01:26:00]  No way!  No way!  And then, and you became the running mate, and then the President.  Hey, well, now wait, maybe this story has a merit.  Suddenly, I'm thinking I might like it.  Yeah, all of a sudden, wait, it's me that it focuses on?  See, that's what I heard, and I thought that would have been a kick.  Oh, that's so funny.  All of a sudden, you're the President.  President Johnny Braum.  I'm thinking they ought to send Mike Brady to Mars.  The first person on Mars, you know, he went, he graduated from being an architect of homes  to developing a space, spaceship.  He gets on the thing, but before he gets there, he dies because he forgot to put a bathroom 
[01:26:30]  on the thing.  That would have worked.  Why not?  If they're selling that other one.  So, wait, they're actually developing this?  Apparently, it has been sold, and it's going to be a television movie.  Any cameos from any original Brady stars?  I might have to pass on that.  Yeah.  I might have to pass on that.  I mean, not you, but some of the other people.  Yeah.  Yeah, I don't know.  I don't know.  I think bikinis and shaving cream are infinitely more interesting, which we're going to get  into in a second here. 
[01:27:00]  Dan, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey, Barry.  A million-dollar question last night on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?  I don't know what the question was.  I heard this, but what was the question?  A million-dollar question.  This was the million-dollar question last night?  What was your mom's maiden name?  Oh.  Wow.  And I got a problem.  Guess who would have been a million-dollar richer if I got an FR?  We did this one on our show.  You got to hear what Regis said, too, after you're done.  Oh, okay.  Wait, wait.  Are you going to guess?  It's multiple choice, though, in millionaires.  Yeah, it is.  Anthony will know.  It's like, what were the choices? 
[01:27:30]  Well, he had it narrowed down.  He used it 50-50.  He had it down to Martin.  Yeah, Martin.  Tyler.  Martin.  Yeah, it was Carol Martin.  Carol Martin.  It was Tyler.  No.  Yep.  Stop it.  No, no.  And you got to hear what Regis did.  The guy called...  Wait, Barry's...  Wait a minute.  Barry's like, wait a minute.  Are you sure?  Wait a minute.  Tyler?  Was Tyler her first name, and then she married Martin, and he died?  It's a trick question.  It is a trick question.  I got you with a trick question.  That's right, Carol Tyler Martin.  The guy uses his phone-a-friend, and he's obviously using the Internet, because he says 
[01:28:00]  to the guy, type this in, and the guy says, I'm entering, I'm entering, and then the guy  didn't come up with the answer, and Regis says, was he using some kind of machine there  or something?  Because he knows nothing about computer.  Regis is a total...  Regis knows nothing about nothing.  What are you doing?  Are you mailing a letter to a friend, hoping for the accurate response?  Yeah.  Too much, too much.  It calls in FedEx.  Imagine if you were on that show, and that question came up, and you blew it? 
[01:28:30]  I blew it.  Oh, that would be so...  Wow, you've finally been stumped on our show.  I would be so proud.  I went with Martin.  Yeah?  Yeah.  You just did?  Yeah.  Martin.  Tyler Martin.  That's right.  All right, Dan.  Thank you.  Okay.  See, we never met her for...  You know, we didn't know her before she was married, so...  Of course not.  I don't think she had a life before...  Don't just don't be kids.  What did you know about that name, first name, maiden name?  Oh, my God.  Please.  Who's out there now?  That's good.  All right, listen.  Are more girls coming in?  Yeah, we've got to take a break.  We've got Barry Williams in the studio.  We're going to bring all the girls that came down from the Whipped Cream Bikini Contest,  and we'll have a little party in the studio, and Barry's going to apply some whipped cream, 
[01:29:00]  all right?  Oh, gee, twist my arm.  I've been practicing my whole life for this, I think.  The winner of the Whipped Cream Bikini Contest is going to Hawaii...  There's the tie-in!  Thanks to...  That's right.  I'm going to give my contestant a little bong to live with.  There you go.  And remember Contiki...  Oh, Contiki Tours.  And we all remember the Tiki.  Where?  Tell them to stay out of those caves with Vincent Price in there. 
[01:29:30]  We played Marcia Brady.  Someone tells me that wasn't the first cave Vincent Price was in.  What's that?  We're going to play Marcia Brady as we go to break.  Don't worry.  You don't have to listen to it, Barry.  The listeners love that song, so...  Sure.  I don't know.  He got his first born.  It was my ode to Marcia.  Watching Marcia...  You know, it wasn't just you that appreciated the girl.  I can relate.  There, Barry.  I know.  I can relate.  Unfortunately, you can relate a little better than I could.  Are you experienced?  Not with Marcia Brady.  Goddamn guy. 
[01:30:00]  I believe it.  That's why he hates me.  It's just such jealousy.  Just for 2,700 miles, you could have been there.  I saw those little pictures of you guys on that cruise to England and stuff.  I don't think he got much, though.  Whatever he got.  I don't care if it's a peck on the cheek.  Oh, you got a little squeezy?  Oh, God.  He gets a squeeze.  He's making the international symbol for us.  Oh, man.  Breast squeeze.  Wah, wah, wah.  God, he's not terrible.  You're the guy.  All right, hold on.  We're going to get to you ladies in a minute. 
[01:30:30]  They're so anxious.  They're just showing their boobs through the glass door.  American hero.  You didn't touch, you know, patch?  A little below action.  What, are you doing, like, karate moves to keep you away from them when you're going to the reach?  It's just so wrong to talk about my teenage experience.  Let me just say that I put my best, best Greg Brady moves on her.  It seemed to work.  I'm jealous of you the most, and then second, I'm jealous of George Glass.  George Glass.  Who had a relationship with the Jan.  Oh, that. 
[01:31:00]  Yeah, wood floor.  Did you have the wood floor down there?  Yeah, she must have.  At that time, yeah.  The anthill?  We call it the Jean Benet.  Right.  It's so bad.  Yeah, you love it.  We know you love it.  I'm going to have to hit my cough button now.  More with Barry Williams and Naked Women next.  How cool is that?  Well, all I hear all day long is cool and tough.  Great Marsha did this, or how wonderful Marsha did that.  Marsha, Marsha, Marsha.  Marsha, Marsha, Marsha.  Marsha.  Marsha. 
[01:31:30]  Looking at the screen, what does the feeling mean?  And I got to see the way down deep in my loins.  Her blonde haired beauty, and who ain't she a cutie?  The best in every club that she joins.  She teases all her fellas, her little sister jellies.  Got it from her head to her toes.  Well, she wears a grooving skirt with a flowered print shirt.  Turning heads wherever she goes.  And for the things she does to me. 
[01:32:00]  Aye, aye, aye.  I'm a very first quarter.  One, two hearts to free.  On a black and white scene in TV.  Oh, she, she, she, she.  You're me.  Aye, aye.  One, two hearts to free.  On a black and white scene in TV.  Oh, she, she, she, she, she.  You're me. 
[01:32:30]  New Virginia High, her sparks and blue eyes.  A smile anyone to die for.  Well, I almost got my load at the Hawaiian episode.  But mommy started knocking on my door.  Six readers and a peach in her bikini on the beach.  The other girls couldn't compare.  Yeah, and what a piece of ass when she took that hula glass.  Her skirt so short, I think I saw her hair. 
[01:33:00]  And oh, the things she does to me.  You're in love for Genesee.  Aye, aye, aye.  I've got my very first quarter.  One, two hearts to free.  On a black and white scene in TV.  Marsha, Marsha, Marsha.  Call me free.

Have a drink.  I want to bang you.  You're not going to hear this on V100.  Have a drink.  I want to bang you.  This is normal radio, right?  Okay.  That's a call, two, seven.  Uh, Anthony, Pinnacle, monkeying around. 
[01:34:00]  Hey, hey, ladies, this one's for you.  You know Pinnacle, uh, horny goat weed, I think?  Gets the guys all horned up.  I'm sure Barry doesn't even need any of this.  Do you have any problems?  Do you have any problems with the sex there, Barry?  No, not having trouble with that.  See?  It's all about inspiration.  Do you know some people do, uh, things called, uh, maintenance sex?  Oh, and what is that?  Yeah, you just kind of keep things going?  Yeah.  They pebble it in.  Like, uh, Saturday morning at, uh, 10 a.m., we're going to have sex.  No, if I need a little inspiration, I try and imagine, uh, 
[01:34:30]  a naked girl with whipped cream over her.  Oh, it's going to be a lot easier to imagine.  Yeah.  Yeah.  By the way, go to www.com.  Our first contestant is up.  Guys, our first contestant, okay?  The first contestant.  The first girl.  Always starts a little, uh, hey, hey.  It starts nicely.  It starts.  She's listening to me.  It starts, and that's the big thing.  It starts.  It starts.  It starts.  Right.  Some people, uh, need a boost in their sex life.  Oh, really?  And the fine folks at Pinnacle, they brought your horny goat weed for the guys.  Pinnacle. 
[01:35:00]  It's a nerve.  I get it.  Yeah.  Pinnacle, horny, uh, goat weed.  And now they have Pinnacle monkeying around.  This is designed for the chips.  Hey, I do not think of monkeys when I'm having sex.  Okay.  No?  No.  Why not?  You ever see those things?  They seem to know what they're doing.  Those are the horniest little animals on the face of the earth.  I do not go.  Damn things have boners 23 hours a day.  Pinnacle monkeying around.  Fan the flames of passion.  Pinnacle monkeying naturally with a potent blend of all natural exotic herbs, including,  get this, the legendary monkey taekwanyin. 
[01:35:30]  Oh, taekwanyin.  Ah, taekwanyin.  I love taekwanyin.  I love taekwanyin.  It's, uh, it's another herb.  It's found in the Fukin province of China.  Can you believe it?  Well, I'm trying.  The Fukin province of China.  It's, uh, it's, uh, for great romance and sex.  The three Ps, pleasure, passion, and pinnacle.  No, Barry, what were you going to say?  There's a couple Ps of this.  I'm just hoping we don't, uh, break down our trade agreement with China with all these  good things coming over.  I know.  See?  Oh, my God. 
[01:36:00]  I was getting a little worried.  They got over a billion people over there.  Maybe it's, uh, taekwanyin.  See?  That's why.  That's exactly why.  It's from the Fukin province of China.  Oh, you're kidding.  F-O-O-K-I-N.  It's a coincidence.  They pay the bills.  Relax.  And I'll tell you a little story.  I read into our airplane.  Did you name it Wong Wei?  Wong Wei.  Yeah.  Let me tell you a little story quickly about, uh, this.  That it's, it's not even on the copy.  Okay, right.  The Fukin province of China.  There's a valley.  And that's where the monkey Taekwanyin grows. 
[01:36:30]  They couldn't get people down here.  So the ingenious Chinese sent monkeys down to pluck this herb and bring it up to them.  That's why it's called Monkey Taekwanyin.  Yeah.  I'm confused because I thought they just got a couple of yetis to bring it back up with them.  Right.  Get the yeti or the Loch Ness Monster can just graze on it.  Sure.  So they get the monkeys out of the valley and they're pulling up the herbs.  Yeah.  And, uh, leaves the wind satisfied.  And, yeah, then they use this herb as a women's aphrodisiac. 
[01:37:00]  I see.  It's great for romance and sex.  And do you take it orally or is it something to do?  Yeah, well, how you apply it, uh, your own business is what I want to know.  Well, some people like to take it orally, sure.  Well, what's on the direction?  That's what I want to know.  Just take it and then, you know, place on ground, life views, get away.  Something like that.  Pinnacle, monkey, around.  July 4th.  I think everything on China.  Oh, you heard of July 4th, though?  Oh, my gosh.  Oh, my gosh.  Got to love that.  So go to a GNC and other fine health food stores and get your pinnacle monkeying around. 
[01:37:30]  1-800-899-5323.  If you don't have a GNC near you, call them up.  And get some pinnacle monkeying around.  1-800-899-5323.  Hour, hour, hour, hour.  By Opie and Anthony.  Serving New Jersey, Connecticut, Long Island.  This is 1027 WNEW.  It's the O&A show in studio. 
[01:38:00]  Barry Williams, the real Greg Brady.  We're doing the whipped cream bikini contest.  We've got a trip to Hawaii to give away.  Ladies, you have all this week to stop on by and get into the whipped cream bikini, right?  Yes.  A lot of reviews coming in on our first contestant.  People saying she is indeed the first contestant.  You know, he starts a little slow.  What?  Hey, man.  It's like going to OzFest.  You know, the first band.  Oh, jeez.  Come on, man.  But it sets the mood for the rest of your time at OzFest. 
[01:38:30]  Right.  You know what I'm saying?  Don't read.  Do you have any of your female listeners calling in and protesting that you don't have any guys  in their little speedos?  Yeah, that happens.  Every time we do one of these contests, some girl calls up and goes,  Why don't you do something for the women?  Shut up.  Like, we're going to sit here.  Okay.  Spray whipped cream on guys' junk.  Okay.  You know, at least we're honest, Barry.  Well, exactly.  But you could have, you know, maybe some of the models sprayed down.  Why?  Anyway, don't even need to go there. 
[01:39:00]  I'm so curious.  Hey, we got Madison from Privilege.  Gentleman's Club.  Madison, always a pleasure.  She's always here when we're doing something like this.  I like that.  And you're going to be in the contest, right?  Yes, I am.  See?  Guys, we're moving right up to Ozzy real fast.  Nice to meet you in person, Madison.  From Zebra.  Remember Zebra?  Yeah, the Zebra reference.  Yeah.  And who are you again?  My name's Alexis.  Hi, Alexis.  Hi.  She's the runner-up Penthouse Pet of the Year, right? 
[01:39:30]  You're like the vice president.  Completely.  Nick, we love you.  I run the show over there.  Nick from Penthouse rocks.  Yeah?  He just shows up with her.  Thank you.  Runner-up?  Why are you running up?  What happened?  What happened?  You have a flaw somewhere that we don't know about?  My best friend got the pet of the year.  Oh, your best friend got the pet of the year?  Yeah.  We were rivaling against each other.  Right.  So your ex-best friend.  No.  My best friend to this day.  Did she have, like, better boobs?  I mean, why did you lose?  Some people are checking in on instant feedback. 
[01:40:00]  She's really, she's really beautiful, too.  I mean, Penthouse, we have the best girls in the world.  You guys, they said she was in the lead until she opened her mouth.  What happened?  Runner-up.  A lot of people are criticizing your voice.  But they don't, they don't do the voice thing.  I know.  It's still picks.  It's still picks.  And runner-up is not exactly losing.  Not at all.  You got to, you know, this is the, um.  No, and I got cash, too, and prizes, and then.  All right, we got a problem here.  It's got money on me, so it worked out great.  I got to interrupt you.  We put the stinky cam on, and for some reason, people decided to put it on Barry Williams instead. 
[01:40:30]  Oh, what is up with that?  Turn that around.  Hey, come on.  They are freaking out right now.  I was going to apologize right now.  I had nothing to do with that.  They're like, hey, let's check.  The cash darn thing turned around.  It's like, hey, let's see what this chick looks like.  Let's see what it looks like.  That's Barry.  We should have put you in a blonde wig.  I'll borrow yours.  Now, this is a little better, right?  That's better.  Now we got it.  That makes sense. 
[01:41:00]  Perfect.  That's good.  Don't go any higher than that.  We'll cut off a couple of attributes.  Do you know Barry Williams, the real Greg Brady?  I do not.  No, we have not met.  Oh, it's nice to meet you.  Thank you very much.  Pleasure.  Did you check out the Brady Bunch and reruns when you were growing up?  I think they all did.  Growing up, she's still doing it.  Why?  It's not my phone.  I'm still young.  I'm not saying it's a fault.  How old are you?  How old are you?  25.  That's really good.  So you could still watch it in reruns.  I'm feeling old lately. 
[01:41:30]  You're feeling old?  A little bit.  I don't know.  I'm going through that.  Well, sometimes when you go through the centerfolds and you see, you know, born 1983.  Oh, my God.  Right.  That's so nice.  Yeah.  Oh, well, hello.  Anthony's got the magazine.  I know.  Yeah, I'm just thumbing through the spread.  Does the word Bogart mean anything?  I'm sorry.  Barry?  Oh, God.  Oh, my God.  Yes, dear.  You have a co-host and one magazine.  Years of not being able to use the bathroom because the girls hog that, and now me hog in 
[01:42:00]  the penthouse.  I tell you, it's a wonder.  There you go.  All right.  That's better.  Okay.  She's right in front of you, but you've got to check her out in the magazine.  Well, you have to put it all together.  The personality, the photos.  You know, when you're working, because this is your work, right?  Yeah.  I know you call it fun.  Sure.  It's a lot of work.  So, are you in the latest issue?  Look, you can't even get in a position like that.  No, this is not working.  This is my pet of the year issue.  Huh?  This is my pet of the year issue in 2000.  In 2000, okay. 
[01:42:30]  But I'm in it, like, all the time.  All right.  Yeah?  The ultimate, yeah.  I'm teaching quite a bit.  Right on.  This is some kind of fun spread, right?  You're in it right there with your hands.  I love this.  Yeah, you like that?  Yeah.  Now, listen.  Do you have, like, things holding, or not in the picture, like, holding your ankles apart or around?  I have to particularly tell it.  You just do that all by yourself.  Wait, what picture, Barry?  Yeah, look at that.  Wow, yeah.  You know, there could be apparatus.  You've got two prop guys just holding your legs up there? 
[01:43:00]  No.  That's good.  I'm just fine on my own, thank you.  You look healthy, too.  That's good.  You're very healthy.  Some girls in the mags look sick in some of the cheaper mags.  No, I'm pan-pan.  You look healthy.  No, the penthouse girls are, they're happening.  You're talking about, like, swank.  It should look like, if you're, let me akin it to gums.  Those look freshly brushed and flossed every day.  Sometimes you open up a swank, you see, like, pyorea and whatnot happening.  An abscess.  But those are healthy gums. 
[01:43:30]  Thank you.  She's got some stuff happening.  I like that.  She likes the landing strip.  No, it's not even a landing strip.  She is a very beautiful girl.  That's what you call, you know what that is?  That's like when you first open up a pack of Hubba Bubba.  Remember that?  Right?  It's healthy.  Healthy, soft, chewy.  Hubba Bubba always was.  And then sometimes you open up a swank and you see, like, that licorice gum.  Really?  Yeah, or that licorice gum.  It's like the gum that you find underneath the desk. 
[01:44:00]  ABC gum.  ABC gum, right.  The gum under your desk during eighth period.  That crank gum that turns your gums to your teeth black.  The black gum.  That's it.  The licorice gum.  You're beautiful.  Well, that's obvious.  Nice.  She's Hubba Bubba.  I don't know how to deal with penthouse pets.  Isn't that good?  They all wear that key, too.  Let everyone know.  Very carefully.  Penthouse is so good.  Very carefully.  Yes.  Penthouse, Guccione, he so understands the woman's form.  You know, there's no teasing about it. 
[01:44:30]  We get the lines, you get right to the heart of the action.  It's just wonderful.  Did you ever do a shot where you needed corn syrup with a little bit of powdered sugar stirred in?  Yeah.  Okay.  She's laughing.  She knows what we're talking about.  See, Mary, what happened, we were deciphering the chemical makeup of some of the fake man juice that is sometimes used in these magazines.  Well, I don't see boys.  Corn syrup.  Because we noticed the last penthouse issue, it was on her, if I could say that perfectly, so I think this had to be set up. 
[01:45:00]  Yes.  So we got Nick from penthouse on the line, and he told us what it was.  A little caro syrup.  Caro syrup.  Caro syrup.  Caro syrup.  Well, I don't know.  No, no.  I don't know.  I hear it's real.  Some of it is.  You can tell some of it is, but some of it, it's just too well placed.  Yeah.  And, like, the shot would have had to have been done at the exact moment that it happened.  That's what penthouse photographers do.  Ah. 
[01:45:30]  You're good.  You are good.  They capture the action.  Nail it.  All right.  We got a camera here.  Let's see.  Really.  Barry, if you will.  Camry.  Yes.  The perfect artistic expression.  Perfect placement.  That's how good I said.  I said, I'd have to go again.  Just sitting here.  No, I don't think.  I didn't say that.  I don't think she's going to be participating in the whipped cream bikini. 
[01:46:00]  No, I don't.  No, no.  Oh, in your content?  Yeah.  I was wondering if I could judge.  That's really...  Well, it's up to the listeners.  Like, we put it on websites and the listeners judge.  Yeah.  Yeah, you're, like, professional.  So that's...  Judging is...  I saw it, though.  I mean, you can see that.  You can just see it out there.  Oh, yeah.  You can get all these chicks with chocolate.  Got the tarp down.  They're starting to show up like crazy.  It's going to be a mess.  Judging is a little like watching, you know?  It's exactly like watching.  Why do you want to watch a game when you can be in it? 
[01:46:30]  Yeah.  I kind of like that voyeur thing once in a while.  Work the pinthand, Barry.  You like the voyeur thing?  I like a little bit of everything, but sure.  You want to get behind, like, some glass and we'll do the voyeur thing.  Give us a prison visit?  I'm more the watcher to watch.  This is what we'll see.  Do we have a prison visit?  Do you ever do that?  No.  Do you get behind the glass and you press your boobs against the glass like we're in prison?  Right.  And we go, oh, Billy.  Oh, Billy. 
[01:47:00]  Billy.  Oh, Billy.  Well.  No, not that part.  We need the boobs, though, against the window.  Well, I...  No, huh?  Well, we've got to get Madison into some whipped cream and Barry was going to do the honors.  Oh, my goodness.  Yeah, Barry, would you like to...  Would you allow Barry to fashion a bikini on you out of whipped cream?  You would?  I guess Madison and Alexis, they were talking about how, you know, beautiful they are.  What was happening?  It was when, what do you call it, Demonique or whatever her name is?  Demonique.  Oh, the Demon. 
[01:47:30]  Yeah, Demonique.  Whatever her name is.  I don't know.  That's what she calls herself.  All right.  She's standing waiting for the bathroom and they decided to have a little conversation.  It's like, oh, you're very beautiful.  Oh, I heard some of that.  Right.  You look good naked.  Yeah.  Yeah, I was hearing that conversation.  And then she told you, so do you.  I bet you would anyway.  So you're a good liar.  No, I'm not naked.  No, because you weren't naked.  The other girl was naked, completely naked.  She's wiping whipped cream off of herself.  A lot of girls, seriously, do not look good with their clothes off. 
[01:48:00]  What do you think, though?  Swank?  Half these chicks just don't.  Yeah, what magazine would you put her in?  Cherry?  Just so the listeners have an idea of the first contestant of the whipped cream bikini contest.  What magazine?  I don't even know.  I don't even know.  Stanko magazine.  It's just a conversation you want to be around, though, you know?  Yeah.  Oh, you look beautiful naked.  I love your clothes.  That's terrific.  Oh, those are real.  They're pointing up for you.  I love that.  My boss is standing right there the whole time, just cracking up. 
[01:48:30]  Penthouse has bosses?  Well, my, like, you have, like, people, not that, like, you're, you know, that send you  out, like, pet promotions department, that's what I meant.  Oh.  Like, my manager.  Oh, a manager.  Kind of.  Well, I, he's, they're not that, but it's, right, Nick, it's like a pet, pet promotions  department.  They won't let me watch after the girls.  No?  No.  They have someone else?  I hope you're not saying he's a pet.  I gave it to me.  No.  It's a manager. 
[01:49:00]  Manager.  Okay.  She's a pro.  Hey, uh, Madison, get near Barry Williams.  He's going to put the bikini on you.  Are we doing it in here?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah?  Well, yeah.  I think the whipped cream, though, slides off the girls.  There's a problem.  It's very milky and creamy.  You've got to kind of lie down a little bit.  Well, is this, is it low fat?  Because I'm going to laugh right now.  Now, the whipped cream is very milky and creamy.  And it slides off the girls.  Not a drop of tarot syrup to be found.  Yeah, I think it's got to either be shaken or refrigerated a little bit. 
[01:49:30]  Shake it really well.  And it's not low fat.  I don't work with low fat.  You know, I should work with low fat.  Yeah, shake it up real good, and then maybe it'll stay on.  Yeah, let's get Madison.  Let's give it a try.  Madison, if you would take your clothes off.  Maybe the whipped cream is flat because everyone's doing whippets.  The whippets, I know.  Enough with the whippets.  Oh, my God.  I know.  It comes out like Johnny the Watt Holmes after a full day of shooting.  There you go.  I'm trying to be gentle, Madison.  All right. 
[01:50:00]  Yeah.  Man, it never gets old seeing Madison naked.  My God.  Isn't that good?  You like that, Barry, right?  I love kids.  Look at that.  What's not to love?  How do you always know when to come in and see it?  We have some website, man.  You have the best record for a guest coming on this show.  We have so many guests that come in and go, man, you know, I hear about all this great  stuff, but when I'm in, nothing happens.  You, you're like gold.  Too good.  Too good. 
[01:50:30]  All right.  There we go.  I'm concentrating.  Don't make a mess out of my room.  Don't make a mess out of me.  She's never heard that before.  I'm going to give you a few.  If I may, I'm going to give you a kind of a.  A Barry.  Well, you got to get in there.  Barry.  I want to give her a small bikini.  Okay.  So that she has a chance at actually winning.  There you go.  All right.  You're applying the string.  Very nice.  Oh, I'm just going to go a little bit.  Just look at Barry. 
[01:51:00]  Hey, Barry.  Decorate.  I'm concentrating.  Decorate one boob that says congratulations on the championship and the other one, better  luck next year.  Now, I think that's a bikini.  I think that's a bikini.  Well, oh, oh, sorry.  Barry.  You know, you got to fix it.  There you go.  Because it's falling.  See, I knew it.  It's very creamy.  It is.  No, I missed your hand.  Sorry. 
[01:51:30]  That was great.  That's holding up.  Barry's like the Picasso of whipped cream.  He is.  He is.  A little more.  A little more.  Look at that.  That's good.  We need to get you on your back fast.  Yeah, yeah.  Get on your back.  It's tripping all over.  Yeah, she's got to lay down.  Yeah, take the.  Whoa.  Wow, there she goes.  Wait, something just.  You know how to pick the days.  There she goes.  You don't have to cover that up, Madison. 
[01:52:00]  I don't see why we should.  Yeah, yeah.  How about she lays down?  I think she should.  I think she should.  She has some sort of.  Oh, man.  Uh-oh, what happened?  You're really messing her up.  She's.  Uh-oh.  Barry, how'd you get it on her back?  That's not whipped cream.  That's talent, Rick.  That's talent.  Gravitational forces have to.  But the whipped cream chain was in front.  Do you want me to leave the tattoo revealed?  Madison, are you trying to cover up your Playboy tattoo? 
[01:52:30]  Oh, my gosh.  You got a Playboy bunny tattoo?  Cat fight.  Cat fight.  Come on, kick your ass.  Cat fight.  Cat fight.  All right.  Well, yeah.  Lean back.  Yeah, lean back.  And Barry will have sex with you, I guess.  You lean back any further.  You might as well at this point.  Now, now.  Okay.  Good.  Now.  I think if he was in Hawaii, he'd be married in. 
[01:53:00]  Jewelry.  What?  She's wearing jewelry.  Oh, down there?  Yeah.  Oh, oh.  Oh, oh.  This is a stark difference from the sound of music that Barry's been touring with over  the whole country.  He's been touring in the sound of music.  And look at some of these pictures.  This is a stark difference.  There's a picture of him.  Look, he's dancing with a small child.  And now he's playing whipped cream.  Oh, wow. 
[01:53:30]  Okay.  Unbelievable.  He's a party guy, man.  You've got to love it.  I must say, that's a fine whipped cream.  Nice.  I gave her a string bikini.  Yeah.  Yes, you certainly did.  We're getting pictures.  They'll be up on WNAW.com very shortly.  It's Madison from Privilege.  Madison, smile.  Boy, Barry, you really got all the nooks and crannies, didn't you?  You know, maybe Madison doesn't feel comfortable.  You might have to do more shots outside the studio just to...  Yeah, absolutely.  Because she's...  Yeah. 
[01:54:00]  Get her outside because we wouldn't want any bad pictures.  All in the nozzle.  Barry...  All in the nozzle.  You've got a little adapter here.  Barry, it's all over your hands, Barry.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, and you've got some whipped cream on there, too.  I'm sure...  Barry, you want to wash your hands up?  I would like to do that.  Someone will show you that.  I'd like to do that.  I'd like to do that.  An executive bathroom.  Yeah.  Rick, show Barry the bathroom so he can wash his hands off.  Crank one out.  This place is going to run.  You know, this is so good.  I know.  This is just so good.  You guys are my best friends.  You are.  I mean, this is the best. 
[01:54:30]  This is the best.  You know, for the years of joy you've given us on television, this is the least we can do.  This is very kind.  Very kind.  I didn't know we were using a strawberry sauce.  Oh, no.  Was it hurt?  Oh, no.  You see how quick he looked at his hands up?  You are the...  I would expect Rick to take it to that level.  All right.  Does anybody have a paper towel?  Yeah, I know.  Yeah.  We're going to take a break, but Madison's pictures will be up on www.com very shortly. 
[01:55:00]  All right?  All right.  And Barry can wash his hands off and do whatever else he needs to do in the bathroom.  More with the real Greg Brady and Alexis from Penthouse.

Just show up between 3 and 7 anytime between now and Friday.  And don't forget, grand prize for this contest, Trip 2, Hawaii.  Madison getting her pictures taken outside the studio.  They'll be up on WNEW.com very, very shortly.  They got some chocolate and cherries working on them.  Yes.  Getting a little more creative with our wives.  Creative.  Yeah, guess where the cherry is. 
[01:59:00]  Ooh, what a surprise.  I'm shocked.  Alexa from Penthouse is here.  Look at Joe trying to work it.  And she's making sure that the whipped cream bikinis are looking good.  Yes.  And, of course, Barry Williams in the studio.  Yeah.  Always a fun day when Barry shows up.  Now, Rick, we have some other ladies out there?  Yeah, we've got another girl out there.  All right.  How many girls have done this so far?  Two so far.  Madison makes three.  And then we've got a fourth.  Nice. 
[01:59:30]  Not bad.  Good for the first day.  That's very good.  And you know what it is?  A good prize.  That's why.  Usually we have these crappy giveaways.  Now we've got a good prize.  We do, Barry.  It's hard.  Are you going to Hawaii?  I'm not.  The winner.  The winner.  That's good.  I've never been to Hawaii.  Oahu?  Maui?  Maui?  Where?  Big Island?  Kauai?  I've never been.  Timbuktu?  I would go to probably, yes, the Big Island.  Go on a weenie?  I don't know.  I'd have to take a tour.  I'm not like you.  You know, he's down in the Arizona.  He's going to the cave with Vincent Price. 
[02:00:00]  Come on, I want to lay you.  Come on, I want to lay you?  Yeah, that old gag.  Now, what's your name?  My real name's Claudia, but I go by Kate.  Oh, right.  No one heard that.  This is the last name I'd rather like.  Oh, Mike?  You want to talk into the mic there?  There you go.  You got some wild tattoos on you.  You can move the mic up.  You don't have to bend down.  You got six?  Yeah.  All right, make sure you're talking to the mic, sir.  Okay.  Move it.  Do you want to show us the rest of the tattoos, or? 
[02:00:30]  Yeah.  All right.  We've got one on our arm.  We've got an Egyptian temple down here.  I see that.  It's kind of big.  I see where the entrance is.  It's like right there.  Wow.  I've got it.  Show Barry.  Come on over to Barry.  Why me?  Why me?  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  The lighting is better here.  I'll take it.  Go with the bed.  Whoa, who's going into the temple?  Short round?  It's at the temple of doom, isn't it?  It's at the temple.  This is the door to the temple.  Yes.  And that's cute. 
[02:01:00]  Hey, kid.  I trust you on that.  Don't pull on it.  Don't pull on it.  Don't, don't.  Can Barry knock on the door?  The knocker.  Can Barry knock on the door?  No, no.  Because that looks like a door knocker.  No?  All right.  I dare you to pull it.  Like a monster's door.  I didn't hear any bells go off.  Because you've got to pull it.  You've got to pull it, Barry.  She's got a door knocker down there.  Wait, wait, no.  Grandpa.  We need to go back to the door knocker because Barry's going to...  Eddie, you want to... 
[02:01:30]  All right.  Yeah.  Go ahead, Barry.  All right.  Ding dong.  Ding dong.  You know, I hate having Barry Williams and Harry Rex my whole time.  What have they been doing out there at the Brady Bunch household?  Not like that, by the way.  Not like that one.  All right.  What else you got there?  This is Ihorus.  It's the god of the wings.  All right.  All right.  God of the wings.  You're into this whole Egyptian thing, are you?  Yeah, kind of.  That's cool.  And then I've got a black widow spider. 
[02:02:00]  Mm-hmm.  Because I usually like beep men and...  And kill them and eat them.  Yeah, they die, you know.  Really?  Heart attacks, usually.  It's not my fault.  I have nothing to do with it.  That's temporary, darling.  Just don't let them flee.  That's temporary.  All right.  They come back to life again later.  Not usually.  Black widow.  You know, I had to bury a couple.  And then...  This is a Bacardi bat.  Yeah.  Yeah, we saw the Bacardi bat a couple weeks ago.  Well, I used to be, like, sort of addicted to Bacardi when I was 18, you know? 
[02:02:30]  Mm-hmm.  Really?  And now it's H.  Just a little bit.  I'm wicked.  Not wicked.  I know what wicked is.  Wicked.  She's a wicked wicked.  Like a nature, spiritual witch thing.  Yeah, well, a lot of people would be like, oh, are you the devil?  Are you worshiping the devil?  Yeah, but...  Can you blink your...  Like, twitch your nose and make Mr. Tate think he came over the house earlier, but actually he didn't?  I can make time go by, like, 50 seconds.  Can you?  I don't even know, right?  Do that. 
[02:03:00]  Oh, wow, yeah.  Did you notice that time you went by?  I didn't even notice it.  I didn't even notice it.  Security, code blue, code blue.  Sorry, what's wrong?  All right.  I'm busy.  All right, so you're going to be in the whipped cream bikini contest, of course, right?  Yeah, as long as there's chocolate and cherries and other fruit and...  Yeah, we'll be able to cover up everything.  No problem.  Okay, good.  Cool.  All right.  Nice.  Can you rotate your head 360 degrees? 
[02:03:30]  Yeah.  Along with her body.  She did it.  Hey, can we see your balloon art?  What's a balloon art?  Is that...  I didn't know what that was either.  It kind of...  I came here.  It could look like that, but only different.  Oh, you mean...  Oh, yeah.  You ever look into the knot of a balloon?  Jesus.  There you go.  Wow.  Whoa.  It's moving.  All right.  Calm down.  Oh, my gosh.  Didn't you go... 
[02:04:00]  Sorry, didn't you guys see a volcano like that on the Hawaiian episode?  It just swallowed something.  Yeah.  Thank goodness this one didn't explode or erupt.  It almost, man.  That's what I was doing.  He's shot.  Yeah.  Wow.  See, you're shy.  Sure.  Yeah, you're shy.  It's because my knot's a balloon knot.  It's the one that's on my...  Oh, you...  It's going to have to be closer and...  Yeah, you move that, too?  I'll tell you.  That thing looked like the afterburner on an F-16. 
[02:04:30]  Didn't it?  That was going.  She put a lighter to it.  This is a better trick, but...  All right.  It involves the balloon knot, but not as closely involved.  Not as closely involved.  Wait.  Where are you going?  Wow!  She just did the ultimate split, and now her butt cheeks are alternately throbbing.  Hey, that's pretty good.  Very good.  I really enjoy it.  You've got to love the Wiccan.  Oh, wow. 
[02:05:00]  Let's see that.  She's putting her ankles behind her ears.  Behind her neck.  It's black magic.  Look at that.  Witch!  Witch!  Witch!  That is something.  You get your ankles behind your ears.  That's got to make that thong hurt.  You know what?  Yeah, really.  You know what?  We've got to see you.  Look, see.  No, show Barry.  Look at that.  That is simply amazing.  Wow.  I saw your molars that time. 
[02:05:30]  That is amazing.  I never saw it myself, actually, but I've heard about it.  Well, it looked like something was trying to get out.  They're like, hey, Steve, did you get video of that?  Yeah, I'm pretty sure.  I wasn't looking directly into the camera at the time.  Well, why don't you show her what it looks like?  She's never seen that before.  You've never seen that?  You did that in a mirror, right?  You've never done that in a mirror?  Actually, I probably did, but I think I might have been drunk at the time, because I don't  really remember it.  Yeah. 
[02:06:00]  I probably did.  You know what it looks like, Anthony?  I like that, yeah.  Anthony, it looks just like when Grandpa used to take his teeth out during Stalin to scare  the kids.  It did.  It looked like so many things.  I mean, that looks great.  People usually like that.  Check it out.  You're going to get to see your balloon not talking.  Oh, no.  She's at the side view.  This isn't a front view. 
[02:06:30]  Yeah.  Well, you'd need a back view.  All right.  You know, Steve, take one for the team.  One more time.  All right.  Why don't you do it again so Steve can get a good shot of that?  Show Steve this time.  Sure.  All right.  Hold on.  All right.  You ever put your finger in a sea urchin?  There you go.  Steve is laughing so hard he can't even get video.  I think it's breathing.  Yeah, it's breathing.  It's breathing.  It's gasping for air. 
[02:07:00]  That's something.  It almost looks like Jim Carrey from Ace Ventura is going to stick his arm in his head  any second.  That's good.  Hey, it's clean.  All right.  Steve's got a good video.  That's good.  All right.  So you're going to be able to see this for the first time.  Check this out.  Steve's got a video.  Because when you do tricks with that thing, you've got to keep that squeaky clean.  You know what I mean?  Barry.  I know.  Could you imagine?  Only when Barry's in.  Watch.  Watch.  You're like a magnet for this stuff. 
[02:07:30]  It lost something in the translation?  If Marsha would have finished off with that, the silver platters would have won.  I swear to God.  That dog act wouldn't have a chance against the dancing kinky.  We would have won.  I'm not sure what, though.  Oh, boy.  I bet they do.  I feel a lot more than I think women do.  Yeah, guys like that?  Yeah.  That's nice.  I thought you were going to fall in love with yourself, looking at that.  That's a stranglehold.  Pretty exciting.  Oh, you did.  Hey, have you ever had sex with a family member? 
[02:08:00]  What?  What happened?  What are you asking sex for?  I'm just curious.  I hear that my brother has, like, really big man stuff.  Right.  Your brother?  Yeah.  And you had once with him?  Well, one time when I was, like, 16 years old, I hear it, like, he told me that I was  really drunk, and I, like, went into his bed and started kissing him, and he started  kissing me back, and then he was like, oh, no, man, you're my sister.  And he, like, looked up, and he was like, ah!  And then what? 
[02:08:30]  Then I was like, ah, you're my brother.  And I went in my room and passed out.  Hey, call me Krusty.  It was okay, but...  But so the answer is no, I guess.  Oh, you didn't?  But how did you know?  Oh, you never really did it.  How did you know about the man jump?  We didn't want to get a girl together.  How did you know about the man jump?  You're what?  Wait, wait, wait.  I went upstairs, and he was, like, kissing her, and then he was like, hey, get out of  the room.  I want to do her.  So, then I laughed, you know.  I just kind of got her started for him.  See, Barry, you thought you were the only one that did your sister.  This is the hottest, sickest story I've ever heard in my life. 
[02:09:00]  Oh, no, that's not...  Actually, I had a better one than I was going to tell you guys.  This one's really...  I can say it on there.  It's not bad or anything, but it's really, really good, and I wish my dad in Florida could  be hearing this one.  You're a filthy whore!  Yeah.  One time, like, I was...  At band camp?  I know.  You got me there.  You beat me.  All right.  I was kind of, like, you know, making myself happy.  Sure.  I moved down to Florida, and I was kind of getting bored with my hands, so I went in the refrigerator 
[02:09:30]  into the crisper drawer, and I found a carrot, and I tapered the carrot and made the carrot  my friend who played nice with the carrot, and then I did my thing with the carrot, and my  dad's really a beep hole, and so I figured...  Figured.  Didn't figure a ward cleaver in your...  Throwing the whole carrot away in the garbage, so...  Oh, no.  Because then he'd be like, ooh, the...  Oh, no. 
[02:10:00]  Throwing the carrot away in the garbage.  We can all see where this horrible story is headed.  Okay, so...  Back in the crisper.  Back in the crisper.  And the next day, his girlfriend's going, I'm making stew.  Would you help me cut up some carrots and some potatoes and some celery and onions on  my shirt?  Hey, Jack, this tastes like trout.  No, huh?  No, actually, there, he was like, hey, this stew's the best stew I ever tasted, you know.  What's your secret ingredient? 
[02:10:30]  I'm like, I really can't tell you that, Dad, but, you know, every time you took a bite into  a carrot, I was just like, ten points.  All right, let's ask, uh...  No!  Let's ask the penthouse pet.  It's to you, Alexis.  Comment?  Comment?  Oh, wow.  I'm...  I'm just kind of taking it all in right now, actually.  Sounds like a...  I passed.  Can you comment?  It sounds like it. 
[02:11:00]  I mean, what, you know?  Barry, comment?  Well, it sounds like a lost Brady episode to me.  I did not make it to the...  Was that Jan or Cindy with the carrot?  Did Alice make stew?  What a great...  Meatloaf.  She made meatloaf.  Stew is on, Mr. Brady!  Awesome.  I just love that line of what it was.  Hey, Peter, get out of here.  I want a door.  I want a door.  Hey, that's...  You got some good stories there. 
[02:11:30]  That's a good story.  That's a good one.  Do you have any more about, um...  Anything?  Um...  Produce stories.  Well, produce brother stories.  Mechanical.  Mechanical's good.  Um...  Let me see.  Well...  Hmm?  No, but I have some toys in my bag that maybe, you know...  Well, you could demonstrate.  Wait, what...  Bring your bag of tricks in.  Yeah, get your bag...  Get your bag and let's see what's in that bag.  All right.  Well, it's been nice being here.  I think...  Barry, this is probably... 
[02:12:00]  Oh, God.  One of the most twisted girls.  I'm in a corner.  I'm not even here anymore.  What's her bring, like, a can opener?  Yeah, that's right.  An electric one.  Hold on, hold on.  It's like a bag.  Gabe, Gabe, real fast.  Yo, what's going on?  Hey, man.  Does this girl have cerebral palsy or something?  No.  There's something weird about her voice.  Like, what does the law say about molesting a retard?  You've been drinking or anything?  No.  No, that's the age.  You don't drink?  I mean, it's 6 o'clock.  Well, it can't close a block at noon, right?  You start drinking at noon? 
[02:12:30]  What's your poison?  What do you like?  I only had a couple of drinks.  What do you like?  I had a couple of drinks.  I had two Bloody Marys.  Yeah, that's good.  So, because you wake up at noon.  And then you have your Bloody Marys.  Oh, no.  I eat lunch, and I have a drink or two with lunch.  And I've never been on the radio before, so...  You're doing a great job, because I've got to tell you,  didn't she talk through that well as far as disguise and everything?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Because most girls would have just said,  And I took the carrot, and I went, went off my went, went.  So, where...  You know, you did well.  So, where did you bury the bodies? 
[02:13:00]  Well, if I discover...  If I disclose that information, I could get in lots of trouble, you know?  What do you got there?  A whip?  Yeah, well...  And rope?  Wow.  Who carries this with him?  Who carries this with him, Gellet?  Is that a whip or a jump rope?  She's got a whip, rope, and dunking.  What is that?  Whoa.  That's a...  It's a balloon plug.  A balloon knot plug.  Yeah, yeah.  She got a balloon knot plug.  Now, can you use that?  Can you actually get that moving without your hands, if you know what I mean, with that trick you did? 
[02:13:30]  Oh, who doesn't want to see that, Barry?  I'm not here.  I'm not here with you.  Anyway.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  It's a skinny one that you could actually, like, swallow because it's small.  Well, we might just...  You put that in your mouth.  And you know where it's been.  Well, no, it hasn't been, like...  It's brand new?  No?  No, not now.  Not till today.  All right, Anthony?  No, that's, like, sort of...  What?  I just have to give a...  It's a spot that I'm saving for. 
[02:14:00]  I'm saving for marriage.  You're saving for marriage?  What is she saving for marriage?  The spot.  It's a balloon night spot I'm saving for.  Oh, oh, oh.  Well, you're sure keeping it well exercised.  That's nice.  That's nice of you.  That's not the one with the rest of the muscles.  It's like, if you work this muscle in your arm, you're going to work the other muscle like that.  Moving the arm isn't quite as amusing as watching that work.  All right.  Anthony, I just have to give a personal message.  Yes, Obie?  Yes?  Oh, Big Kev, you got an escapee.  Big Kev.  So, you know Big Kev and his basement of horror? 
[02:14:30]  No?  No?  Okay.  Big Kev?  Oh, you got an escapee.  So, what else you got in there?  Are you going to...  No, no.  No.  What else you got in there?  Because I met him and I torched the hell out of him.  Yeah.  Could you show us what else you have in there, please?  Is she doing anything with her balloon on?  I missed that part of that.  Has that been run through a metal detector?  This one's fine, Sam.  What is that?  Could you stand up so we can all see?  Okay, yeah.  It looks like E.T.  It's a really strange looking vibrator.  That's for the G-spot.  It is a G-spot killer. 
[02:15:00]  It totally works.  It's like, you know, you don't have to put this even...  Your first one.  Well, go ahead and demonstrate.  All right.  Sure.  We don't know what she's doing, Barry, right?  Yeah.  We have no idea what she's doing.  Yeah, sure.  And it just kind of works like...  Yeah.  It doesn't turn on?  Yeah.  It's vibrating.  Oh, there you go.  Okay.  Pete's running down the hall.  What's that interference?  I just kind of use it like that.  Yeah.  I mean, I could move this and show you how I... 
[02:15:30]  Yeah, okay.  Yeah.  Just show everything.  What the hell?  It kind of looks like it vibrates and it shaves you at the same time.  Doesn't it?  It does look like they've got a bizarre shaver.  I'm not amused by this at all, Tony.  But I could use the balloon nut plug.  All right.  There we go.  She's got it in her mouth.  And then, Barry, what a seat you have for this.  All right.  Whoa.  Nice. 
[02:16:00]  It's gone.  It's gone.  You're like David Copperfield.  Whoa.  It's gone right for us.  What, he can shoot?  No, you can't shoot that out.  No, no, shoot it.  You're staring at the bejesus zone.  It's like a howitzer.  What?  Oh.  That was lame.  No, that was far enough.  That's amazing.  The military's got to get a hold of you. 
[02:16:30]  All right.  Hold on.  We have to back up because Jim online wants to know more about the story with you and the  brother and the girl.  How did that come about?  Um, I had an apartment with this girl.  She was a dancer.  I was a dancer.  You're a dancer.  Get out of here.  Look at that.  You didn't think that, right?  I work in a country club now, though, really.  Oh.  Anyway.  I didn't hear a tree first.  The money's better.  Oh, really?  So, me and my, so, me and this girl, she was only about, I was about maybe 25 or so. 
[02:17:00]  What?  How old a gal are you now?  Yes.  I would put you at 25.  25 and a half.  Yeah.  I'm really 36.  Wow.  Look at that.  She's holding up pretty good.  Not bad.  Yeah, definitely.  I wasn't going to tell my real age, but you got it out of me.  That's okay.  We don't know your real name.  Yeah, okay.  Whatever.  Anyway.  All right.  So, I guess my brother had come over, and this girl is a total ho-er. 
[02:17:30]  She was a ho-er.  Number one, she's a ho-er.  But how did you know?  Yeah.  How did you figure that out?  Because she, like, pretty much picked some guy up at the bar every night, so there was  always someone different there every single night I went home.  But could she do that with her no-no spot?  Let me get my brother, who doesn't really get much in on this, you know, because, you  know, he's my brother.  So, I figured I'd help him out. 
[02:18:00]  And so, I got her kind of primed, and, you know.  You got her primed, and then he comes over, and you're tagged off.  Yeah.  And except some guy that she was, like, you know, doing at the time, like, kind of came  over, came over, and she was like, oh, get the hell out of my room, you know, and so  she had to go and be with this other guy, you know.  Does someone have a Valium?  I got beat, you know.  I'm excited.  I am totally exhausted.  All right.  The bottom line, this is a sister that loves her brother.  Right.  You see?  That's a caring sister.  Did you watch?  Did you watch? 
[02:18:30]  You can understand that, Barry, right?  I can.  Hey, hey.  Did you watch your brother do your roommate?  No, I didn't get to.  This is a girl.  So, you wanted to.  Oh, yeah.  Barry, this is a girl that wouldn't date the football player of the opposing team  of her brother.  No way.  Not like that Martian.  Damn it.  Oh, my God.  This is a sister.  Look, she's saying, oh, my nose.  That's what she said after her brother, oh, my nose.  Oh, my nose.  Hey, things are falling out.  A ball hit her in the nose, too.  Things are falling out of her bag. 
[02:19:00]  That's her nose.  Hey, what happened?  What's falling out?  What?  Oh, my God.  It's a 38.  What else have you got in there?  And what do you do with the rope?  What do I do with the rope?  Oh, I just just tied a couple things with me, because I guess I was going back to my boy  son's back.  And you tied him up?  Well, I haven't, but, you know, it seemed.  Hey, can we put you in a noose?  I just carry a couple things.  You never know when you're going to need rope or whatever.  Can we choke you out? 
[02:19:30]  You never know.  Those are just things that you want to have on you, because you never know.  Sure.  Those are like, it's like WD-40, KY, Jelly, and Duct Tape.  Those are the three most important things to serial killers.  Not really.  Really?  WD-40, Duct Tape, and Rope.  Remember that for what did we learn today.  And KY.  KY, yeah.  KY.  KY, WD-40, Duct Tape, and Rope.  Just why make them suffer?  I'm trying to visualize what a typical date would be like. 
[02:20:00]  Yeah.  With you and your kids.  What's that like?  You go out on a date.  Is it dinner, or do you get right to just anal intrusion?  Oh, no.  Of course.  Dinner, drinks.  Dinner, drinks.  We start to sex with a salad.  What kind of restaurant does a girl like you go to?  I'm a singer and a songwriter.  I play keyboards and sleep.  Oh, you do?  Yeah, so I'm like, you know, into that kind of stuff.  Yeah.  But, you know, once you go home on a date, you know what I mean? 
[02:20:30]  Yeah.  Once you get home, you know, it's like, you know, you've got to have the necessities with you.  Yeah, but you can scare some guys away sometimes with the rope and the WD-40.  Well, if you're a jerk, you're going to want that rope on you.  But don't grab me so you can tie his hands up.  Can't get a rep on without WD.  Right.  Yeah, and if you have a problem with a flat tire, your alternator's not working, you've  got the WD-40 right there.  Oh, Anthony, where have you been?  I don't know anything, Barry. 
[02:21:00]  Gosh.  Yeah.  I'm missing.  All right, so did you get your...  Wow, it seems really tame now.  Did you get your whipped cream bikini pictures taken yet?  Yeah.  Yeah, really?  Actually, no, I did not.  Suddenly, that seems G-rated.  No.  Oh, whipped cream.  Yeah.  I think I brought some crackers and cheese and wine, you know.  I think I brought some...  Crackers, cheese, and wine?  I know.  Yeah.  Well, that's nice.  Thank you.  That's cool.  Cool.  We appreciate that.  I figure wine and cheese instead of, like, whipped cream and fruit, you know. 
[02:21:30]  Government cheese and ripple.  I call it gripple.  There's that government stamp on it, you know.  All right.  There's a government stamp on cheese and government cheese.  Well, look.  Well, you are quite the pistol.  I got to tell you that.  You're quite entertaining.  Any other tricks before you go out and get naked and get the whipped cream on you and stuff?  What other tricks can I do?  Let me think.  I can stand on my head, and I can also balance a beer on my head and recite the B National Anthem, 
[02:22:00]  the thing that it says on the bottle.  I don't want to plug them.  She mouths it out to me silently like she knows what the F.  Like, I know what the F.  She goes, I recite the B.  I don't want to plug a beer brand.  Oh, Budweiser.  That's all right.  That's okay.  Okay.  So, I can say the whole Budweiser thing.  Yeah.  I'm balancing a beer on my head.  Well, just to make it a little more interesting, we'll get you naked and you can do that.  Oh, yeah.  That's more interesting. 
[02:22:30]  I'd say.  It would be kind of boring just putting a beer on my head.  Don't twist her arm now, Wolfie.  Don't twist her arm.  Can you pop the cap of the bottle with that kiki?  If I could do that, I'd have a really good job as a bartender in a really good club.  I don't doubt it.  I'd go to see that.  Imagine the tips.  You'd have a lot of...  Open that beer.  You'd have a lot of patrons giving the beer back going,  Barkeep, this is coke beer. 
[02:23:00]  I don't think the men would complain much.  No, they would.  The men would complain the women would.  Yeah.  You'd just get the men started and then they'd take their women home.  All right.  Well, why don't we take a break?  All right.  And then we'll have her naked, beer on the head, reciting the Budweiser oath of whatever.  She'll get her pictures done first so the people can check her out on www.com, right?  More pictures up yet, Rick?  Not yet, huh?  Okay.  The website is slammed, so we'll have more pictures up soon.  We'll take one last look here. 
[02:23:30]  See the contestants.  My God, those are fascinating stories.  All right.  I still want to know quickly, how did you know, though, about your brother's man junk size?  Oh, because this girl that I was also with kind of told me.  Wait, you were with this girl?  Hey, what happened to the mic?  I am.  If your brother don't have the biggest thing I ever did say.  I was like, okay. 
[02:24:00]  So that's pretty much how I learned about it.  She got a damn.  Yeah.  Have it on the 30s.  So you share girls with your brother.  That's pretty normal.  Well, no, I usually get them first, and I'm nice enough to introduce him to them, you know,  because he doesn't get much.  That's a great sister, though.  Very important.  Well, he can be a real jerk, and I have a real bad temper, you know, so he's not getting enough.  So I try to, like, throw some of the flow his way.  Take the edge off, yes.  Are you from the South? 
[02:24:30]  No.  I'm from Jersey.  Yeah?  Jersey.  You did a good Southern accent.  I was just wondering.  And it sounds like there's a lot of South in your family.  Yeah, no, we don't live in a trailer park, either.  No?  No, actually, no.  Upper middle class, you'd almost believe, but I don't think you'd believe that after what I put on.  No, I mean, hey, you know, it doesn't make a...  You never know, you know.  Well, I don't know what I'm saying.  See, kids, what happens to you if you don't work for a living?  You don't have to work for a living?  Yeah, what do you do?  I really do work in a country club, and I'm a dancer and a bartender. 
[02:25:00]  At a country club?  And I'm a singer, a songwriter.  Do I play keyboard or TV?  Okay, she's multifaceted.  Hey, we've got to say goodbye to Alexis from Penhouse.  Oh, she's kind of...  You've had it, huh?  She's tapping out.  Wow, this has been a good day.  Welcome to New York, Alexis.  There you go.  The big apple.  The plane came here, and it was really good.  Welcome to New York.  She's like, you know what?  I can't compete with that, so I'm just going to tap out.  Get the hell out of that.  Yeah, it's all hers, really.  All right.  It's all hers.  Cool.  Isn't that great? 
[02:25:30]  Yeah.  Thank you, Alexis.  We'll see you.  Thank you for having me.  And then I think you guys are hosting our Penthouse Beer Party.  Oh, yes, we are.  Myself included, like, with another eight Penthouse Pets.  Nice.  Celebrities running around.  It should be fun.  Yeah.  Thank you guys.  Are you guys doing live, or...?  Could you get my brother some sex?  I'm just taking a...  Yeah.  I'm just taking the ball.  I'm taking the ball from her.  He is cute, you know.  He's good looking.  He just never goes out.  Yeah, come to the party last night. 
[02:26:00]  We'll work the room.  I'm there.  Go find some girls.  There you go.  Thank you.  Yeah, you are welcome.  Okay, so we'll see you guys.  I think it's June 8th.  Yeah, but believe me, it's penciled in on our calendar.  Right.  We're getting ready for the softball game.  Yeah.  Right.  You should join us there.  Oh, yeah.  You go to Penthouse Party?  Yes.  At home.  At home?  At home.  Yeah, we'll talk about it when we get closer.  But Alexis, thank you so much.  I know.  Thanks for having me.  It was good to meet you guys.  Hey, your brother's on the line.  We have to take a break. 
[02:26:30]  No, you're kidding me, really?  Ah, you just hung up.  There's no way.  Guy named Billy?  Is that possible?  Yeah.  Someone just joking.  Too good to be true.  All right.  Well, obviously, we'll be back with more of this.  Whatever this is.  I feel stupid.  Oh, so stupid.  I feel stupid and dumb and dumb.  Opie and Anthony, we've got a smile on our face and our head up our ass. 
[02:27:00]  1027 WNEW.  Yeah.  Hey, Anthony, when you're doing a girl with your brother?  Yeah, let me get this straight.  When you're doing a girl with your brother, if you're a girl.  Right.  All right.  I'm speaking like I was the girl that was just in here.  So when that girl is doing another girl with her brother, yes?  Ah, you're going to need a good bag, right?  Yes.  Huh?

[02:30:00]  Barry Williams, the real Greg Brady, in studio.  I am exhausted.  We just had to say goodbye to the penthouse pet, Alexis.  Yeah.  She knew she couldn't compete today.  Do you think she was offended a little bit?  Oh.  Do you think?  Maybe.  Do you think?  I hate to think that.  You know, she usually only does this.  Yeah, yeah.  Lips the leg off a nice photograph.  She's shooting projectiles out of her.  She doesn't have to make anything move.  You're right.  I think she's a pro.  And, you know, she sat in for it. 
[02:30:30]  But, you know, it's a penthouse pet.  She's a good sport.  Very pretty.  Very pretty girl.  No?  No.  She was smiling.  She liked it?  She was smiling.  She was laughing.  Vinny the Racist wants to come in and say hi to Barry Williams.  Oh, he's a big fan?  Vinny the Racist.  Yes.  You know what I'm talking about.  You know, Barry, I like that there were no moolies on the Brady Bunch.  No, you know.  I like there's no didsoons on the Brady's.  You know what I'm talking about, Anthony.  No, in actuality, like, you know, I grew up with Barry when I was a little kid, like, 
[02:31:00]  in Newark at 7 o'clock on Friday nights.  I mean, come on, the Brady Bunch.  Of course.  Yeah, you didn't?  I did.  I watched more Brady Bunch, I think, than anybody.  I don't know.  You should see what he's doing now.  What's he doing now?  He missed it.  Huh?  That's just this afternoon.  Between the whipped cream and the knocking on hell in school.  There you go.  Oh, man.  There you go.  Look at that.  There you go.  There you go.  There weren't many black people on the Brady Bunch.  Just says that one black kid that the other family adopted. 
[02:31:30]  In the school.  In the crowd scenes.  The family adopted the Asian.  Right.  The white.  And a black.  And a black.  And there was the black chick that went to school with Marcia that was very excited  that Davy Jones was going to come on.  That's right.  She was excited.  She was like, oh, my God.  Remember her?  We didn't let her meet him, but.  No.  She disappeared during the commercial.  How about the flip side?  Shut up, Davy.  Look what she's done to me.  Girl, look what you've done to me.  So, Vinny, you're from Jersey? 
[02:32:00]  I don't know what I've guessed.  You're serious?  Why are you saying that?  I don't know what I'm talking about, Barry.  You're a little bit like you might be from the Newark area.  Exactly.  That's where I am from, Newark.  Look and see.  Wow, Barry, nice.  Good.  You said it about three minutes ago.  All right.  What was your favorite episode?  My favorite episode, besides the Davy Jones one, which was good because I've always had  a crush on Maureen McCoy.  Come on.  No.  Like Barry, I also had a crush on Maureen McCoy.  Be more funny. 
[02:32:30]  There's something I want to ask, Barry, too.  Barry, maybe you might know.  I know she started on Passions, a soap opera, about six months.  Is she not on there anymore?  She did 13 episodes.  12 episodes of Passions.  What happened?  Do you know any?  I think her daughter looked older than she did.  I think that was something like that.  I don't know.  Now, Barry, let me ask you this, though.  I know, like, a couple months ago, there was a little thing with you in the Backstage magazine  about this union thing.  You want to elaborate on any of that kind of stuff that went down?  Maybe I should have brought that up.  Be more funny. 
[02:33:00]  You know what I'm talking about.  Again, I apologize.  I know it doesn't seem like it sometimes, but this is a comedy show.  I know the union stuff, probably very strong with you.  You sound like it anyway.  Let's go bust some heads.  They're scabbing out of us.  The local threes are striking.  They're scabs.  Yeah, if you like yourself, I was a union, you know, in the construction.  I still am.  Actually, I'm a union iron worker.  I had a jersey. 
[02:33:30]  And, oh, you were saying something?  I'm sorry.  I'm listening to you.  All right.  And so anyway, you know, so I'm reading the Backstage a couple months ago, and I see Barry  on there.  But, see, again, I brought this up, and everything was nice enough to pose for a couple photos.  Like me, I feel like a total ass now that I...  Well, talk about the Brady Bunch.  What was it?  Oh, yeah.  You started on the Davy Jones.  I like the kids.  I like the little kid, Bobby Hinton.  I like that episode.  Buddy Hinton.  Buddy.  Buddy.  Real big fan, aren't you? 
[02:34:00]  Yeah.  No, it's very nice.  He calls me out.  He says, listen, I came all the way over here because you were on the air, and I want to  get a picture with you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Very nice.  Yeah.  I'm a big brother.  He's about 14 inches taller than I am.  He's a big guy, isn't he?  I think we're the same age.  I'm going to be 40 this year.  Okay, I'll go with that.  You know what I'm talking about.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Okay.  I thought we were about the same age.  Tony, we need an iron worker.  You're the same age.  I need a union slip.  Come on.  Are you serious?  Yeah. 
[02:34:30]  Now, let me ask you this, though, Barry.  I know you had that thing with Maureen, like that was years ago.  Now, as time went on...  You bet it was years ago.  When the time went on, did you ever try hitting on Jan or Cindy?  She made out?  Barry made out with Florence Edison?  I know.  It seemed like a natural progression.  That would go run through the sisters.  Run through the sisters.  But no, I didn't.  Never?  No, no.  Wow.  As Mike Brady was running through the suns.  Oh, no, no.  Wait a minute.  I'm teasing, of course, because you being one of the suns, so, I mean, you would have 
[02:35:00]  to have had some kind of homosexual episode with Mike Brady.  No, you know, I don't want to sound like a baby or like a fag, but this is like a thrill  for me to be in the same...  Where's this guy?  You know what?  Anyway, and...  I know...  You don't have to give up your guy card for that.  Do the catchphrase.  Yeah, well, you know, it's nice.  No, because Barry, you know what I'm talking about.  No, seriously.  That's his catchphrase.  All right.  Vinny, thank you.  You're doing great.  Good hour, sir.  Put the girl back in.  Oh, no. 
[02:35:30]  Oh, Vinny.  Why is...  Why?  We do this with everyone.  Calm down.  All right.  Don't have a shallow ego like most of the people.  No, I really don't.  I'm just...  I'm really...  This is like a big thing for me.  Isn't that cool, though?  Yeah.  Yeah, you grew up watching.  I mean, now it's like...  But Vinny...  You can annoy him.  But to the people in the car, this is not a big thing.  Okay.  All right.  I sometimes forget to hear so the people...  Yeah, okay.  Listen, get the girl back in, because we want to make her an offer.  By the way, Madison's pictures are up on WNAW.com.  That's right, Vinny.  You can watch.  Our whipped cream bikini pictures are up. 
[02:36:00]  Hey, that's the boyfriend, by the way.  This is John.  John.  Hi, John.  John's the boyfriend.  Hi.  What's up, man?  I had to apologize to him, because we were doing all that talking about his girl.  Wait a minute.  She was talking.  But we didn't know you were here.  I can tell you guys' stories.  Oh, yeah?  You can tell a better story than what she told?  Oh, my God.  That was nothing.  That was the tip of the iceberg.  Well, give us one.  I've known her for 15 years.  She does really good radio speak, if you know what I mean.  She can get it through the sensors. 
[02:36:30]  She can do everything.  So I hope you can do the same if you're going to tell the story.  Probably.  I don't know.  Camouflage.  There's just so many stories.  How was the first time we met?  Oh, okay.  That's a good one.  That's a good one?  Not the first time.  No, the first time I saw you without your clothes on me.  Well, that was the first time we met.  This is going to be just like blind date.  I was a bartender at a club in Jersey.  Just like blind date.  She had the house.  Apparently, she had the house for me.  And one day...  Oh, that was the day to give you the E.  Oh, a little E. 
[02:37:00]  Sure.  Okay.  All right.  It all makes sense now.  And now we've known each other.  And I'm like...  I told you not to sell this near my club.  E, H, whatever.  I wanted it to him really, really bad.  Yeah?  I was like...  Or maybe she bought it.  Whoa, so you just lifted your dress up like that?  I'm at the bar, and she's like, hey, you want to see this?  I'm like, what?  No panties?  That's a natural redhead.  That's a girl you bring home to mama.  So she had no panties on.  She lifts her dress up.  And what happened?  What happened?  I had a girlfriend, so...  Well, almost nothing.  I took her home, but then I...  Give the girlfriend to her brother. 
[02:37:30]  And then you get...  She took her up at the last minute.  Yeah.  And I said...  Beating a carrot to dad after using it to pleasure is better than that.  They could have, like, an argument on over whose man junk is bigger.  John, we're probably going to have to go to inanimate or animal or something like that.  Now, we have a proposition.  Yeah, listen to that.  If you could focus for 30 seconds.  If you listen to the show a little bit, you know that we present to certain girls that  come into this studio.  Only the special girls. 
[02:38:00]  Only the special girls.  We don't offer this to all the ladies.  a certain challenge that we present to the girls.  What?  What?  Oh, you already know what we're going to say?  Oh, yeah.  I know what they're talking about.  It is called the Wiffle Ball Bat Challenge.  Oh, no.  Now, but unless you've...  Well, it's not really girth that we're looking for.  It is length.  You know what?  Because the Wiffle Ball Bat, believe it or not, it's not all that big.  Yeah.  Why don't we...  Barry...  Could Barry take a look at the area to see if you're a good candidate for the Wiffle Ball Bat? 
[02:38:30]  All right.  Barry, if you will...  I don't do anything for Craig Brady.  Oh, my God.  Okay.  I need a shower immediately.  I feel filthy now.  With the boyfriend in the room.  Okay.  Oh, my gosh.  Barry Williams is going to just examine the area to see if you're a good candidate for the  Wiffle Ball Bat Challenge.  Okay?  Allow me to concentrate.  Concentrate, Barry.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  Does anyone know but Barry now?  Okay.  In my professional experience, I would say she is an excellent candidate for the Wiffle 
[02:39:00]  Ball experience and talent.  Look at that.  Well, what do you say someone brings the wiffle ball bat in, you can look at it and decide.  Yeah, let's take a...  Someone please present us with the wiffle ball bat.  John could introduce...  Right.  It would be probably easier if you administered the bat.  Yeah, John could do the administration.  His thing is sort of like a wiffle bat, but...  All right, all right, all right.  All right.  John, I don't want to put John in, but I think your reputation is a little bit at stake here. 
[02:39:30]  His last name is a lot.  You know, that's why everyone calls him John a lot.  So he's obviously got that last name from somewhere.  It's like all the girls are saying, I like that guy John a lot.  But I heard that it was more like, that guy John got a lot.  Right.  I don't know which one.  Right.  Look, in the case, if you can handle John, you can handle the wiffle bat.  Yeah.  I'm trying to see one. 
[02:40:00]  I don't know.  Is it like a beegy wiffle ball bat?  I don't know.  Whoa.  And her last name is Braindead.  Man's wiffle ball bat.  All right, where's the wiffle ball bat?  We're going to listen to a tiff.  Am I going to listen to a tiff?  Oh, I hope not.  Are you guys fighting over there?  What?  Everything's okay?  I don't know.  Okay.  Where's the wiffle ball bat?  It's on its way.  Get it out of the case.  It's in a glass case.  It's in a glass case.  Are they barring at Hooters or something like that?  Hey, what's up with the bump on your arm?  You got a huge bump on your right arm.  Everything all right?  I don't know.  I think I got bit by something. 
[02:40:30]  Oh, yeah.  Wow.  Let me take a look there.  Oh, look at that.  You got bit?  That's a spider bite.  It's a spider bite.  I remember the other day I was in his car, and this little teeny spider was like,  one of the black jumping ones.  Oh, yeah?  I'm terrified of spiders.  But you tattooed one on you.  Spider.  Spider.  Yeah, it was sort of like that.  Whatever.  Oh, my God.  Are you kidding me?  Here comes the wiffle ball bat.  Look at the wiffle ball bat.  That's that Beastie voice song. 
[02:41:00]  I did it with the wiffle ball bat.  So, I'm on the run.  The cop's cop.  I'm going to write a button.  Now it's time to have some fun.  The king of rock is my name.  A rock.  It's no, I'm the real Greg Brady, man.  Look at me.  I'm all in the air.  She can sell it.  Could Barry Williams examine the glass case in the bat?  Yeah, it is.  Oh, my God.  I have not seen it.  Here it is.  You've got to love how we handle it.  It's in a protective glass case. 
[02:41:30]  And wearing gloves?  Yes.  We handle it like it's the last bat Ted Williams used.  I prefer Barry's chamber.  And I see that it has certain markings.  Yes, Barry.  You've noticed the markings.  It has been in competition.  Oh, my gosh.  You see where it is?  I wouldn't have liked to have met that marker.  No, you didn't want to meet that.  Believe me.  Unless you strap a board to your butt.  Do you have some markings on it for, like, where they went to?  Thanks.  Yes.  Look, I think, judging from this, I think you have...  I think you could do it.  We go...  I mean, my boyfriend might need, like, about a half an hour or an hour. 
[02:42:00]  Yeah.  Like, the bathroom person.  She can do that.  No problem, he said.  Well, we could...  All right.  Roll on a condom.  Wait.  You know, I've got to make this perfectly clear.  You can do either...  You know, either end is up for grabs.  Either end is up for grabs.  Either end is up for grabs.  No, don't touch it.  No.  She'll try it.  Look at Sticky.  There's been condoms on.  Look at Sticky getting ready with the doctor gloves.  I don't think men understand...  I don't think men understand girl junk that much because...  Yes, we do.  It feels good.  Period.  The whole thing is about tapered ends. 
[02:42:30]  Like, if it starts in a point and gets bigger, it's apt to work a lot better than just being blunt.  Like a lug nut.  That's why you could use the handle.  Yeah, that's why you could use either end.  Yeah, that's why I might be good for the handle before.  Yeah.  Yeah, there you go.  Whatever suits you.  My girl, but about as sharp as a sack of wet mime.  Well, yeah, you could...  Yeah.  Just say, very good, Barry.  Yeah.  Hey, look at you.  You've done a little radio, huh, Barry? 
[02:43:00]  He's just administrating, so...  Stinky's got the gloves on.  He is taking out the condom.  Because we practice safe, wiffle ball batting.  I think we need to do this to some Brady Bunch music.  You want to get some Brady music out?  Do we have some Brady music?  Maybe off Naps?  Do you want to hear the instrumental stuff that we used to have?  I like the jazzy one.  I'm...  You know what? 
[02:43:30]  I'm glad Sherry Schwartz is alive.  He'd be turning over in his grave.  What name?  And actually...  You know, I like plastic.  This one doesn't have any batteries.  So I think I'm going to have to gradually bow down to this, you know?  Oh, no.  Here's the story.  Give it a try.  There's something wrong with it. 
[02:44:00]  That end.  That end is fine.  The youngest one in curls.  No, do the handle in.  Do the handle in.  She could do it.  There goes some lube.  Oh, my God.  You realize that like ten years ago?  Yeah.  If we had had a dream like this, we would have woken up laughing hysterically. 
[02:44:30]  I know.  So there we are.  And Patty Williams is hanging out.  And this girl's got a whipple ball bat when it comes.  And the Brady music is playing.  And the Brady music is playing.  And I woke up and finished the other mushroom.  And I went to sleep.  It's like a bad trip.  A good trip, actually.  All right.  Well, Jim, this doesn't happen in hallucinations when you go insane.  Wait.  Do we have the field mic?  Give the field mic.  I don't know if you guys knew this, but...  Where are you?  I used to go out with Zach Hearn, gay.  And he's been going out with the same man for eight years. 
[02:45:00]  He should have been the person to do the wiffle ball bat.  I'm sure you could take a lot more than me.  Oh, my God.  You are a gem.  I've got to tell you.  You are a gem.  All right.  Did she fall over or she put herself in that position?  I got you.  I got you.  He's now saying...  It's a disclaimer.  I'm not the boyfriend.  I'm kind of a sex partner.  Can I have some foreplay?  A little foreplay boyfriend or a sex partner? 
[02:45:30]  I mean, with the bat.  Oh, with the bat.  Yeah.  Oh, there you go.  Now, take your time.  There's no time limit here.  And no description of what's happening.  Oh, my God.  I already signed a ring.  I'm okay.  Hey, Stinky, get down there.  Yes.  All right.  But I'm not going to lie, you know.  Well, take your time.  Take your time, whatever it takes.  We don't know what you're doing.  We hear you're giving the whippable bat to your brother when you're done. 
[02:46:00]  Is that true?  Yeah, I'll feed him in the head with it.  It's going in the head with it.  Look at that callback.  That's great.  It's not biodegradable.  I could actually move it.  Well.  Yeah.  Oh, well.  Yeah, see, I'm draining.  Are you getting annoyed?  For me?  Annoyed?  Oh.  Well, I'm a little annoyed when she moved to Florida with her other lover.  Okay, Mark, you go ahead.  Oh.  Oh, and then when she cheated on me with that other guy, the one who paid her. 
[02:46:30]  Oh, that really.  Oh, my God.  But she made $200, though.  Come on.  Yeah, thanks, hon.  Yes.  For that one.  Yeah, and you made me spend it on you.  Oh, my God.  Hey, Stinky.  I can bring home the bacon.  She's shaking the bat around.  Look at that, oh, my God.  She's singing show tunes.  Oh, my God.  It's been real. 
[02:47:00]  You know when he said...  She kissed the bat.  She kissed him.  Make sure you know where the mark is.  Okay, now who wants to play baseball?  Did you get the mark?  No, actually, you got the mark, yeah.  Yeah, wow, not bad, not bad.  Oh, my Lord.  Yeah?  Not bad.  Well, make sure she signs that.  Now, there was a little tiff going on during that.  Now, what happened? 
[02:47:30]  Yeah, what's wrong?  I know that you...  She seems like a free-spirited girl and stuff, and...  I think she's a little too free-spirited.  Really?  He just thought it was, like, demeaning to women, which I think it is, too, but, you know,  what the heck?  But now, the paying thing.  Well, no, actually, because, I mean, you know...  He used to be a prostitute.  Really?  Yeah, right.  That's a good...  Actually, he used to be a prostitute.  That's where I met him.  I met him on Christopher Street down in the West Village in the meat market. 
[02:48:00]  Yeah.  He was wearing this really cute red dress.  His nasty just looked absolutely gorgeous.  Really?  Yeah, you would have wanted to, definitely.  Yeah, as you can tell...  But then you go down there and be like, whoa!  So effeminate.  I look just like a woman.  Wow, okay.  This is a little too real in here.  Getting real.  All right.  Wow.  You guys just want to keep that fun, free-living fantasy going on here.  Yeah.  I don't want to make anybody uncomfortable.  Do you guys want to break up on the air, or what?  Yeah, I've known her for 15 years. 
[02:48:30]  15 years.  I would be proud.  Wow.  John, be proud.  Okay, listen.  There's not much that can make me really that uncomfortable.  Good.  Yeah.  I mean, a little bit.  A little bit.  A little bit.  So you found your...  You found your...  Okay.  We're going to take your word for it.  Considering I'm a hurricane.  Best line that probably didn't make the radio.  Yeah, don't worry.  That got dumped, I'm sure.  But we're starting a new thing.  Steve, did you start that?  The dump sheet from the show online?  Yeah, it's on the site.  The Daily Dump Sheet is on the site right now.  The Daily Dump Sheet. 
[02:49:00]  Everything that gets dumped from our show is on foundrymusic.com.  Go to Foundry.  All the lines you missed because they had a dump out of down the hall.  And the guy down the hall keeps track of it.  And he sends us a little email thing or a copy of what he dumped out for the show that day.  And we read it and just go, oh my God, this is ridiculous when you look at the context of it.  And now you can see by reading it on Foundry Music what gets dumped out every day.  Ah, there it is.  The wiffle ball bat going back into its case.  What a day. 
[02:49:30]  What a day for sport.  Back in the case.  Toss or cakes.  There it is.  It's like, it's more famous than the Olympic torch.  Yeah.  And Stinky takes it away with his purple gloves.  Thuggy.  All right.  He's like really scared of it, huh?  Yeah.  Everyone is.  Listen, we got to take a break.  I'm scared of it.  Me too, you know.  If it wasn't for condominiums.  Right.  I wouldn't have.  Hey, wait, wait.  Is the boyfriend still pissed?  You all right?  You all right with everything?  Like I said, it takes a lot to get me upset. 
[02:50:00]  She's already pretty much upset me as much as I can.  All right.  Then why don't we get her?  Why don't we get her out of the studio?  We'll take a break.  All right, guys.  Thank you.  And we'll play a round of what did we learn on the O&A show.  Opie.  Opie.  Opie.  Opie.  Anthony.  Anthony.  Anthony.  Anthony.  One, two, three, seven, WNEW.  Ah.  Anthony, Planet Java.  Yes.  Iced coffee just got cold.  It's Planet Java, the wildest thing to hit the streets in a long time.  No, I think that's cakes.  Keep an eye out for the Planet Java sampling truck. 
[02:50:30]  They hit the streets and they're coming to an area near you with cool new flavors like  Javadelic, Tremble, and Caramorca.  Javadelic's like this grown-up milkshake, perfect low-fat mix of milk and coffee.  Caramorca's a chocolate caramel coffee.  It's a dessert.  It's a morning drink.  What the hell is it?  It's a great mixer.  Yeah.  Get the mic out.  Get the mic out.  Sorry, go ahead.  Turn the mic from the studio off back there.  Make sure the monitor's off, dude.  Go ahead. 
[02:51:00]  Anthony, Planet Java.  Yes, perfect thing, blah, blah, blah.  A morning drink.  It's a great mixer.  It's a perfect mixer.  What?  Let me set it up.  Okay.  How can you possibly go over the line?  Where's the line?  I know.  You're just jealous.  You're just jealous.  You're just jealous.  You're just jealous because of the bathroom.  You're just jealous because of the bathroom. 
[02:51:30]  Yeah, you're not going to get anything better than that, but continue.  Yeah, and of course, tremble.  You need an extra kick in your day.  121 milligrams of caffeine.  Turn the mic off.  Oh, it just went out.  All right, nothing's going on.  Go ahead.  Tremble's the highest caffeinated drink in the country, Opie.  So students, truckers, moms, anyone who needs a major boost is going to love Tremble.  It does the trick deliciously.  Be yourself with Planet Java iced coffee. 
[02:52:00]  With an attitude and available wherever Coca-Cola products are sold.  Iced coffee just got cool.  It's called Planet Java.  Opie and Anthony.  1027.  You C-sucking F.  Cool jack-off ass F.  Opie, um, church Sunday, like you're doing?  Opie and Anthony show.  I love being absolved and then F-ing it all up again. 
[02:52:30]  This show flew.  It really did.  I want to thank Barry Williams, the real great Brady, for coming in today.  I want to thank you.  Yeah, you can thank us today.  I'm thanking you.  It was fun.  It was too good.  Too good.  Always, always fun when Barry comes in.  Magic happens.  It was a good start to the whipped cream bikini contest.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We have a trip to Hawaii to give away to the grand prize winner.  So ladies, come on down any time this week between 3 and 7 and show us what you got.  We put you in whipped cream and stuff, okay?  Dare I say it was a sunshine day. 
[02:53:00]  There it is.  Yeah.  Dare I say it.  Welcome.  Springtime for Hitler.  Did you learn anything, Barry?  Yes.  I learned what a knocker is.  A knocker, a door knocker.  That was good.  And I learned the whiffle ball bat.  You learned that?  I did not know a whiffle ball bat could be used in such a way.  See?  Most people just play whiffle ball with it.  And I did not know that whipped cream could be an artistic experience.  You finger painted.  Finger pretty much.  Yeah.  That is good. 
[02:53:30]  And also that you have a lot of nice friends and girls that will come down and play along  with Opie and Anthony in the afternoon.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  And I learned.  Steve, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  Great show.  Thank you.  I learned today that when something's not working, just paint it.  Just paint it.  And one more thing.  I learned that banana juice shows up on a black light.  Oh, yeah.  Yes.  We did learn that.  There you go.  Great job, guys.  All right.  Peace.  Bye.  Well, I didn't thank the New York City Police Highway Patrol Division. 
[02:54:00]  I had to thank them very quickly.  One officer in particular.  Again, I got pulled off.  Does he know who he is, or are you going to name him?  Oh, no.  I don't name him.  No.  He knows who he is.  I'm not.  We support the NYPD here.  Absolutely.  On this show.  And we've had a couple of the highway guys up here to sit in on a couple of fun shows  that we've had.  We never say their name because they get in trouble, and I think they deserve to see a show  just like anyone else.  And today, as I was doing about 60 down the West Side Highway, I got pulled over.  Yeah, that happened. 
[02:54:30]  60 and what?  Like 30?  I think it was construction, so it was 20 or something.  That was really bad.  That's a triple.  And then I heard, well, listen to this.  He's got a racket going.  The lights are going.  Eventually, they're going to just give him a police car.  I need a police car.  So it's maybe the most important thing I learned today.  So I shut up and listen.  So I'm driving.  I see the lights behind me, but it's by the Javits Center.  They've got the track.  The trail is all over there.  And I'm not going to be the guy that just stops the goddamn car in the lane and plugs  up the traffic.  So I wait a little while.  I wait until I get some room.  I pull over.  He gets out of the car. 
[02:55:00]  He's got the highway cap on and stuff, which looks like a regular cop, but kind of scrunched  down a little.  Very intimidating.  Comes to the window.  License registration.  I find my license.  I give it to him.  And then I'm like, I can't F around.  I've got to pull the PBA card immediately.  So I pull it out.  What's that?  Oh, no.  I didn't do this Tony Soprano deal.  I go, hey, you want me to get you some lunch?  Yeah.  No, no.  I got the card out right away.  And he goes, what's this? 
[02:55:30]  What are you doing?  You want to show everybody?  He goes, what?  You want to get out and walk in the crosswalk and wave it around?  So I start laughing.  This is funny.  He goes, this isn't funny.  And I'm thinking in my head, no, that was really funny.  I just think you're out there.  Hey, I got a card.  I got a card.  So I started laughing.  He said it wasn't funny.  And then he goes, who do you know?  And I said, who gave me the card?  I said, he's a good friend of the show.  Keyword, the show.  Keyword.  And he asked, what show? 
[02:56:00]  And I said, Opie and Anthony.  He's like, get the F out of here.  Wait till, you know, my son hears of this, blah, blah, blah.  No, he dropped the attitude as soon as you said, the show.  Opie was like a switch.  He had that real hard-ass highway patrol attitude, which, you know, they have to have.  You're out there and you're doing your job.  But then, click.  I'm curious to find out whether or not you've ever had a ticket.  Oh, Barry.  I'm sure Barry gets out of tickets all the time.  All the time, right?  I would just like to welcome both of you to the wonderful world of celebrity. 
[02:56:30]  I think you deserve it and you've earned it.  And you should be wearing it like a beacon.  If I'm in trouble and I'm not recognized, I just break into a few little bars of that team song.  I'm sorry.  I was going how fast again, Don?  What?  On my way to the driver's license, I'm pulling out 8x10s.  I'm pulling out CDs.  I'm pulling out books.  You know, I know my license plate and my license is in here somewhere, sir. 
[02:57:00]  What's your family, your kids, would you like some stuff?  It's here in my Fillmore Junior High jacket.  Let me go.  Oh, no.  A pack of valiant cigarettes just fell out of here.  But when he's in the bad situation, he's doing the down version of the theme song.  Right.  Exactly.  That's when it's real somber and sad.  I remember that.  Or if I'm walking around the streets late after midnight, you know, you've got to give...  You've got to be badass, Barry. 
[02:57:30]  That's funny, Barry.  So I want to thank, you know, that member of the...  All right.  Real fast, we've got a few of these out there.  Anthony from West Orange.  I learned every woman in New York is on the rag.  Juan from Long Island.  I learned that Opie's son will play basketball.  You have to go back to the end of the show for that one.  That's good.  Jerry from Medicine.  I learned sometimes you see pyorea in swank.  Whoa.  Pyorea, right.  I mean, fucking gum hell.  Carrots are a girl's best friend. 
[02:58:00]  If you save your balloon knot, you're not a ho-a.  Ho-a.  Tony, she was a ho-a.  Spanky from Greenwich.  I learned that the three essential things for life are...  Anthony, do you know?  Pleasure, passion, and pinnacle.  WD-40.  Duct tape.  And rope.  And rope.  Absolutely.  Right.  How could I have forgotten?  She's trying to think of mixing WD and KY.  What does that get you?  Maybe you're helping your engine block.  Mike.  Hey, what's up, guys? 
[02:58:30]  I have two things.  But first, everyone buy the Breast of Rock Up on mp3.com.  Oh, thanks.  Thank you.  You got it, John.  I was talking to you yesterday on EPSA.  All right.  All right.  I learned male body glitter is called jizz.  That's right, yeah.  And I learned the demise of the king isn't until a month and a half.  Okay.  See you later, boys.  All right, Mike.  An educational afternoon.  Wasn't it so educational?  It's like college.  Coming in here.  It's like a field trip.  Yeah.  We didn't even get to Brother Joe's country version of Special Olympics by Stephen Lynch. 
[02:59:00]  Well, you know something?  When the country versions of ACDC songs come out, which they have, and we played them last  week, what could be far behind than country versions of Stephen Lynch parodies done by Joe?  It's actually Tennessee Stephen Lynchburg.  Right.  Someone remind us early in the show tomorrow, we'll do that for you, okay?  Because we have a problem with short-term memory.  I learned if I get pulled over to put on my Barry Williams mask and start singing the  Brady Bunch song.  Very good. 
[02:59:30]  Listen right up to the end.  Those are available on my website, by the way.  Barry, you got to plug something.  Yeah.  No, no.  This is too good.  It's your website, man.  All right, you plug it, then.  BarryWilliams.com.  BarryWilliams.com.  Okay.  He got that.  Sound of Music is all over.  I'm not plugging anything.  It's just funny to say that after what I've watched you do today.  You know what I do for the website, though?  People sign the guest book, and I ask to be an honorary Brady for life. 
[03:00:00]  I actually do that for them.  You can write people an honorary Brady.  I write the honorary Bradys for life at BarryWilliams.com.  Very nice.  It's too fun.  And you're going to play in the sophomore game if you're free?  June 9th.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Second base.  What's the matter, Vinny?  Can I use the whiffle ball back?  Oh, it slipped out of his hands again.  Do you guys think I can play this year?  I know last year you guys shut me out a little bit, and I was at the cages for like two months,  you know, hitting the fast pitch softball thing. 
[03:00:30]  Vinny, you're on my team.  Serious, sir?  Yeah, Vinny, you're on my team.  Hey, Vinny, but do you mind a couple of maybe the zooms on the team or what?  Come on.  You know what I'm talking about.  You can't put them on Opie's team.  That means I'll win again.  Yeah.  Earl's a ringer, man.  All right, we've got to go, but thank you, Vinny.  Yes, of course, you'll be invited.  You'll be invited, sure.  Thank you, Barry.  This is like a huge thing.  And, Barry, you're radio gold, so don't wait six months before you come back. 
[03:01:00]  Yeah, I was on tour for six months.  I just finished.  How about you come back tomorrow?  Well, I'm going to be on tour tomorrow.  Thank you, Barry Williams.  Thank you.  I'm the sweetheart.  And Anthony.  That's the a-hole over there.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  W-N-N-D-E-E-W. </pre>
