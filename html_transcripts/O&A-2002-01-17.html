<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast was a whirlwind of crude humor, bizarre listener calls, musical interludes, and contest promotions.  The show kicked off with the announcement of the "Naughty Nighty" contest, a two-week competition encouraging women to wear their "naughtiest nighties" for photos at studio locations in New York, Philadelphia, and Washington D.C.  The hosts, fueled by their perceived low D.C. ratings, planned a broadcast from the capital to defy expectations. This announcement was interwoven with humorous retellings of past contest failures, including the legally problematic "Feels for Meals" (involving a woman in a refrigerator box) and the equally bizarre "Mayonnaise Jar and Yellow Jacket" contest.  Numerous listener calls followed, ranging from contest entries to criticisms of the show, bizarre personal anecdotes (including one caller detailing a sexual encounter and suggesting the woman for the Naughty Nighty contest), and even a report of seeing a TV advertisement for the radio show.  Further promotion included mentions of an upcoming "Stalker Patty Cribs" segment and a highly anticipated interview with Buddy Epson. The hosts also discussed their upcoming visit to the Mütter Museum, sparking conversations about unusual museum artifacts.  Throughout this segment, the hosts liberally used crude and offensive language.

The Buddy Epson interview followed, featuring the musician performing several songs, including a children's song ("Angelica") with unexpectedly racy lyrics and his signature tune about Snowshoe Thompson.  Multiple iterations of his "Well Doggy" catchphrase were interspersed.  Epson's website and CD order information were repeatedly provided. The interview was followed by a call from Lisa, who expressed interest in "yellow discipline," leading to explicit conversation with Jim Norton.  This section also included discussion of the Naughty Nighty contest, an advertisement for Diamond Vision (with Jim Norton's personal experience mentioned), a humorous account of Jim Norton's restaurant experience, a pie-throwing incident involving Fred Durst, a Patriots ticket trivia contest, Jim Norton's dislike of the Brooklyn Diner, a brief appearance by Scott Farrell, a post-show foosball game discussion (featuring Stinky), and a Seattle listener call with Kurt Cobain and Aberdeen, Washington, conversation.

The show continued with a chaotic mix of topics. Opie's Ozzy Osbourne and Beatles collections were showcased, along with a discussion of Patty's hair and a pair of ant glasses sent to the show. More Buddy Epson songs ("Angelica" and "Snowshoe Tom") were played, followed by an extended, improvised segment looping and layering Epson’s "Well Doggy" with pornography. Patty, a regular caller, came to the studio, tried on the ant glasses, and was playfully teased.  A listener email referenced Moose Moran and his "Tie a Yellow Ribbon" protest. The Naughty Nighty contest continued, with a woman named D changing into her lingerie on air. The hosts reviewed photos from a listener's deal to get a three-way if his wife's topless pictures received 10,000 views.  "The Bitches That'll Get You" highlighted a lottery winner's ex-girlfriend situation.  Robert Clary's singing was discussed, and a caller attempted to explain how to produce a queef.  The segment ended with calls to the "F.U. Line" and a discussion of a Monica Lewinsky HBO special, punctuated by numerous crude jokes and sexual innuendo.

A segment dominated by Jim Norton followed, with extensive ribald jokes targeting his physical appearance, bathroom habits, and interactions with others.  Self-deprecating humor from Opie and Anthony about their own appearances was included.  Vulgar and sexually suggestive comments were frequent, with a recurring theme revolving around the show’s bathroom cleanliness and its cleaning person. Norton shared an uncomfortable restroom anecdote. The hosts discussed expensive restaurant meals and preferences (Opie's wine preferences in particular). Listener calls provided feedback.  The "Unlucky Lottery" segment featured bizarre death stories, and "What Did We Learn?" showcased listener observations.  Upcoming Stress Factory shows and a "Naughty 90s" photo opportunity were promoted, along with a mention of Andrew, a staff member.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  I don't have my machine. I don't know what happened to it.  Rick felt it was more important to play foosball than set you up, Anthony.  I don't have my machine for some apparent reason.  Welcome to the O.P. and Anthony Show in the New York area.  877-692-1027.  Anywhere else, including Washington, D.C. 
[00:00:30]  Hell, we've got to start somewhere.  866-277-4WOW.  That's 866-277-4WOW.  We may be making a trip to Washington in the very near future, Anthony.  Yes, I was involved in that little meeting myself.  What was that, the emergency crew they sent up from Washington?  That's nice. 
[00:01:00]  Oh, my God, we've got to do something.  Looks like there's a panic going on in Washington, and they brought up a bunch of people.  Yes.  You know, trying to just knock some ideas around.  And one idea is, hey, let's take a trip to Washington.  And say hi.  Say hi.  We'll broadcast from the plush studios of JFK.  Because they're saying we don't have any listeners in Washington, D.C.?  Yeah.  I think we have listeners in Washington, D.C.  They're somewhere. 
[00:01:30]  I'm going to prove the ratings wrong.  Oh, really?  Good luck to you on that little mission.  Well, we're going to need your help in Washington.  Yeah.  And you better start telling your friends.  And we'll have a good old party in Virginia.  Of course.  How's that sound?  In old Virginia.  We'll have details.  Matter of fact, if we do it in the very near future, Washington could be part of our Naughty  Nighty contest.  Naughty Nighty.  Naughty Nighty contest starts Tuesday on the Opie and Anthony show.  Yes. 
[00:02:00]  It's a contest we've wanted to do for about three or four months.  We finally worked out the details.  And it's going to rock, I'm telling you.  It's a very easy concept.  Except you girls just got to come in to the studio.  Show up in your Naughty Nighty.  And we'll take a picture.  And it'll be put to a vote on the website.  That's it.  Our listeners will decide who has the best Naughty Nighty.  The naughtier, the better.  And we got cold hard cash and possibly a really good trip.  Yeah.  Details coming soon. 
[00:02:30]  Don't worry.  It's not like the old days.  We really got real prizes to give away for these contests.  Yeah.  In the past, we had to fake it.  And you know that one, what was her name?  Jen, who won the best boob contest or came in second?  Uh-huh.  She won skis without bindings?  Skis, no bindings.  That's great.  Here's a prize that's going to cost you a lot more money just so you could use them.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Have fun.  So now when we give out skis, we give out the bindings, too.  The whole kit and caboodle.  We've come a long way with our marketing around here on the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:03:00]  But Naughty Nighty starts Tuesday on the Opie and Anthony show.  In the New York area, ladies, all you have to do is show up between 3 and 7 when we broadcast next week.  Okay?  Gets a little confusing, though.  Yeah.  Huh.  Explaining never works with our listeners.  No offense to you guys, but I...  Well, because you get all confused and stuff.  I learned this in broadcasting.  Yeah.  In my college radio courses.  You're supposed to do one thought per break.  One thought.  One simple thought per break.  But then when you start explaining a little further than that, then everyone gets all crazy. 
[00:03:30]  And then they search out a pop tune somewhere because they can't handle it.  Well...  All right.  Go ahead.  Try to do a little explaining.  Naughty Nighty contest starts Tuesday.  Yeah.  Why Tuesday?  Because we're taking off Monday for MLK.  Right.  Want to show the brother some respect.  There you go.  We're representing.  We're representing.  I'll take the day off.  So we'll start it Tuesday.  Right.  So ladies in the New York area.  That means ladies in the Philly area. 
[00:04:00]  If you think you could drive up between 3 and 7, great.  Come on by.  MLK Day.  What a doodle.  You know if they just...  Eh, forget it.  The ladies in the Boston area.  If they feel like they can make a little road trip and get down Tuesday, that would be great as well.  Yeah.  You getting it?  Yeah.  If ladies want to take the road trip from Cleveland or Buffalo, God bless you.  Well, this is going to be going on for how long?  Two weeks.  Two weeks.  So we're going to be in Philly, right?  Well, see, that's where it gets confusing, Anthony. 
[00:04:30]  I know.  That's why...  Slow down.  I'm just trying to get the info out there.  The first thought I want to get through to people is that the contest starts Tuesday.  Tuesday.  Because we will not be here Monday.  Okay.  Pay attention.  All right.  People are looking at their radios like these guys are crazy.  But trust me, there's a lot of dummies that listen to us.  And I'm not talking about you.  There you go.  And the people we are talking about, they're so stupid, they don't even know we're talking  about them.  So that's why this is a safe comment. 
[00:05:00]  All right.  So Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday of next week.  Yeah.  Naughty Nighty contest live from our studio here in New York City.  Right.  Okay?  Ladies, if you can make the drive from wherever, I don't care.  Maybe Sacramento wants in on this contest.  Hey.  Maybe you're in town.  Just get your ass to New York with your Naughty Nighty.  We'll take your pictures for the website.  Right.  Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday.  Uh-huh.  Friday, we'll be live in Philadelphia.  So why would you show up in New York, right?  Oh, no.  So on Friday, that's when we welcome all the fine ladies of the Philly area to come by 
[00:05:30]  the WISP studios between 3 and 7 with their Naughty Nighties to get their pictures taken  for the website.  I'm confused.  I told you.  So that's Friday.  Friday.  Then we have a whole nother week of qualifying after next week.  In New York.  Well, Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday in New York.  From 3 to 7.  Right.  Uh-huh.  Then Thursday and Friday, if we can work out the details, we're going to be live in Washington, 
[00:06:00]  D.C.  Uh-huh.  Thursday and Friday, the girls in the Washington, D.C. area can come by with their Naughty  Nighties to be in on the contest.  There you go.  How about this?  This is even easier.  All right.  For two weeks, starting on Tuesday, after this weekend, starting on Tuesday.  It wouldn't be two weeks officially then.  We will be.  Well, you know what I mean.  We will be holding the Naughty Nighty contest.  We are going to be in New York and, uh... 
[00:06:30]  Philly and Washington.  Philly and Washington.  You will know where we are on any given day.  We will let you know, hey, we're here in Washington.  So we better tell people...  Or, hey, we're in Philly.  So we better tell people a lot where we are.  Yeah.  Where we're broadcasting from on any given day.  What if people want to plan ahead, Anthony?  Maybe they have to...  F them!  Maybe they have to tell their boss, look, I'm going to be sick on Thursday because I hope  you're going to be in Washington, D.C. two weeks from today.  Well, if you listen to us, we'll be promoing where we're going to be.  All right. 
[00:07:00]  It's very easy.  Okay.  And in whatever city we're in, girls, you show up with your Naughty Nighty.  What if no ladies show up?  Then we're F.  They look really stupid.  I think ladies will show up.  It's a Naughty Nighty contest, too, which gets the girls that might be a little shy for  some of our completely nude festivities.  Well, we understand the ladies like to cover up in the winter a little bit.  Yeah?  Especially here on the East Coast.  Oh, yeah.  Because they don't shave the hair?  You know those chicks that do that sometimes? 
[00:07:30]  They let their hair grow in the winter a little bit.  They don't shave their hair in the winter.  Mary, you do that?  You shave your legs in the winter?  Yeah.  Oh, you do?  Okay.  But girls, instead of...  Some girls don't.  Instead of shaving every day, it's like, ah, it's winter, I'll shave every third day.  Yeah.  Look like a Sasquatch.  They don't get the tan, they get a little paley white.  We all do.  Eh, a couple pounds.  Gain a couple pounds wearing sweaters.  No one cares.  You put on your Naughty Nighty, it's going to look hot.  That's why the Naughty Nighty contest, perfect.  It's covered up a little bit.  We're smart. 
[00:08:00]  I'm smart.  I'm smart, Mikey.  I was passed over.  We're smart.  You're my little brother.  Maybe we should do this with baby steps.  How about baby steps?  How do you mean?  Uh, this coming Tuesday, we start the Naughty Nighty contest here in New York.  Jesus Christ.  I'm getting scared.  Whoever doesn't know what we're talking about out there right now, please drive into a big  cement bridge abutment. 
[00:08:30]  Because you have no right to be occupying this planet.  Frank, what's going on?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  All right, I got it down.  Yeah.  Monday, the contest starts in the celebration of Martin Luther King, right?  I told you.  And Friday, you'll be celebrating your ratings in Washington, right?  Right.  Right.  Okay.  I couldn't resist, guys.  Take it easy.  There you go.  I know, we sound pretty stupid to some people.  Yeah.  All right, it's that easy.  We'll take baby steps.  Naughty Nighty contest starts Tuesday here in New York.  Ladies, between 3 and 7, get your asses down here to get your pictures taken. 
[00:09:00]  Get those sweet asses.  You don't even have to call since they're coming.  Just show up.  Yeah.  Just show up this coming Tuesday.  I get it, Naughty.  Oh.  You know, that's one thing we got to get used to.  She participates in all of our contests now.  Doesn't matter what it is.  And she's going to want to do this.  What happened to Cribs?  Tomorrow.  You're doing it tomorrow?  You're doing Stalker Patty Cribs tomorrow?  Stick it, Petty Cribs.  As soon as she calls me back and confirms it, she said it's a go because she doesn't work.  All right.  Stalker Patty Cribs tomorrow on the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:09:30]  So, Stalker Patty shows us her little hobble.  Ernie, I was implying that your description of the Naughty Naughty contest is just as easy as navigating foundrymusic.com.  Which is virtually impossible.  Come on.  It's easy, right?  Steve Austin checking in.  What?  All right.  Jeff, what's up?  Hey, man.  How you doing?  Pretty good, Jeff.  That's great.  You guys have some good prizes.  Now, I'm still waiting for my chance to win the Aztec. 
[00:10:00]  Ah, we'll never live that one down.  Remember the Aztec?  Dan the man.  But that's not our problem.  Dan the man.  Later, guys.  Wait.  Remember Dan the man, our old promotions guy?  He said we had an Aztec?  No problem.  Go on the air, man.  Get a contest going.  Like, okay, you can win an Aztec, blah, blah, blah.  I think we had two.  Oh, we don't have one.  What?  It's like, you better find some kind of, you better find a Mexican Indian that we can give 
[00:10:30]  away if you don't have that vehicle.  And that was for one of our greatest ideas of all time.  Yeah.  And it will happen eventually.  There's two ideas that we have come up with that we still haven't been able to do.  That we want to.  Very bad.  The most, the famous feels for meals?  Yeah.  That's around the holidays.  We want to do this where we get a girl or a few girls in a huge refrigerator box, cut  a couple of holes out in the front.  She's naked in there.  You get the cop a feel.  The money goes to charity. 
[00:11:00]  Goes to feed the hungry.  Feels for meals.  Lawyers have a problem.  Something to do with prostitution or something.  Even though we're donating the money.  Prostitution.  And then we say, well, what if they just bring food so there's no money being exchanged?  We almost had them.  We really did.  I think next year.  I think next year is the big year for Feels for Meals.  When it does, we'll show you just how huge it could be.  Oh, yeah.  And then, I'm telling you, this idea.  You know what?  I hope another DJ out there just does this idea.  You just want to hear it.  I just need this idea done. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah.  Because our lawyers are a bunch of pussies and they can't figure out how to make this  work and I can't believe it because we had the guys lined up and ready to go.  Lined up and ready to go.  They were going to sign whatever it took to be involved with this contest.  Contest is very simple.  We get a bunch of mayonnaise jars.  Yeah.  Empty mayonnaise jars.  We put a yellow jacket in each mayonnaise jar.  The very area.  Oh, God.  What's that noise?  A little much to handle. 
[00:12:00]  That bothers me.  Yeah.  All right.  Just imagine listening to this on the radio.  So, we had at least six or seven guys lined up.  They were calling like crazy, if you remember.  We had to finally tell people, look, we have enough people for the contest.  Mayonnaise jar, yellow jacket inside.  Guys were going to put their junk in the mayonnaise jar.  In the jar.  You're under the top.  You slam the whole jar right over your vitals.  Right.  And the first guy to get stung by the yellow jacket on his junk was going to win the Aztec at the time. 
[00:12:30]  The Aztec.  Whatever.  Whatever it was.  Insert car here because we had the car dealers lining up.  It beats the hell out of the last person to take their hand off of it.  Just imagine the anticipation of sitting there and waiting with the jar with a bee over your junk.  No.  Just waiting to feel that knife-like pain.  Let me tell you why this is a brilliant contest, Andy.  Yes, yes.  It's not all about just sitting there waiting.  Uh-huh. 
[00:13:00]  These contestants would have to try to make the bee sting them.  Yeah.  You've got to get them angry.  That's what makes this brilliant.  You've got to get them angry.  Maybe they prepare the area before they even get in here.  With a little honey.  A little honey.  Yeah.  You might want to sweeten it up for the little guy.  And you would know who got stung.  There would be no doubt.  Oh, yeah.  No doubt.  You'd hear just a horrendous scream.  And then the welt would rise up on the junk. 
[00:13:30]  Lawyers have a problem with this contest.  Would it have been an actual unit or yam bag?  Anything.  Like, you just throw it over it.  If you can get that whole mess inside the mayonnaise jar.  Yeah, yeah.  There you go.  You've got a better chance.  More surface area.  You know what?  That would hurt.  No ass.  It gets all swollen.  Looks like a blood sausage.  But the worst would be the guy that got stung immediately second.  Right, exactly.  The guy that couldn't get the jar off fast enough because somebody won already. 
[00:14:00]  You know that would happen, Terry.  You're just nothing unless you're, Danny.  There you go.  And, of course, second place.  You get nothing.  You lose.  Good day, sir.  Yeah.  And a comment from the imaginary winner.  Ah.  Ah.  My new favorite clip.  Ah.  We get so excited around here when we can exploit our new favorite clips. 
[00:14:30]  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  My new favorite one is the shut up.  Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up.  That one and the guy imitating, ah, we're going to turn this thing around and say, wow.  Oh, Rick, thanks for the help.  Keep your chin up.  You're the only one that knows where that clip is.  Yeah, hidden in the room.  Those are where all the clips are.  So, anyway, so with the bee contest, the lawyers had a problem. 
[00:15:00]  Even though we got six or seven guys that said, look, I will sign whatever it takes to get it.  Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up.  Yeah.  So, I don't know.  We might have to revisit that one with the lawyers in the near future.  Just imagine listening to that on the radio.  And scream.  Oh, yeah, give me my other new favorite clip.  But we're going to get through this.  We're going to turn this thing around. 
[00:15:30]  We're talking about Washington.  Yeah.  Keep your chin up.  Make the toolbar.  All right, let's go to Jesus the janitor.  Jesus!  Yo, what's up, guys?  I'm still waiting for you guys to come to my house for the Super Bowl party.  Um, did it.  Did it once already.  That was Roger, our other head of promotions guy.  Damn.  Pop-tot Roger.  Damn.  All right, guys, bye.  You know, when you do a promotion for a radio show or a radio station.  Yeah. 
[00:16:00]  It should involve more than 30 people.  30 people at most.  It was brilliant.  We're going to send the morning show and the afternoon show to separate houses for the Super Bowl at someone's house.  We'll bring the soda pop.  The big winner gets, uh, Opie and Anthony goes to their house with a big screen TV to watch the Super Bowl with people they don't know.  Great.  Thanks, Roger.  That was a fun one.  They should do that now and have Pharrell have to go over someone's house. 
[00:16:30]  Hey, how you doing?  Ah, I'm going to drink all your booze.  Where's the fat lady?  Is she sick?  There's a fat lady.  I'll make side bets with the children.  I'm back.  I don't care.  I'll bet anybody.  I brought Romeo Boyd and Pele.  Where's the foosball table?  Where's the foosball table?  I'll kick some of that.  I'm going to throw a bottle through this television.  That would be entertaining to watch.  Barry, you're next on the Opie and Anthony show.  What's going on today?  Guys, I hate to do this.  I'm still a little bit confused because I have the perfect lady for that competition. 
[00:17:00]  And you said between three and seven, but she's seven and a half.  So does she still qualify?  I'm still throwing off.  The hours of three to seven.  Thank you.  All right.  Thank you.  So it's not a good idea then.  No.  It starts Tuesday between three and seven.  Naughty nighty contest here in New York.  Get your asses down here, ladies.  All right.  Let's go to Sal.  Sal, what's up?  Is this going to be another contest where Stalker Patty wins it, bro? 
[00:17:30]  Stalker Patty doesn't win the contest.  She has never won one of her contests.  She hasn't won one of these contests.  All right.  How about the fact that it will probably be the same whores from the local clubs coming down there?  We got a view again with those oversized, disgusting, fake things.  Oh, my God.  That's what, see, some of you guys don't really like that.  Ant and I are now syndicated.  Just think.  More talent.  Come on, right?  We need the real girls down there because these chicks, if they come trotting those beasts in again, bro, 
[00:18:00]  we're in trouble.  They're trotting those beasts in.  All right.  The talent pool is bigger, but most of the stations we're on are getting involved with this contest in their own way.  So it's going to be interesting to see what city wins the contest.  Right.  All right.  All right.  Peace.  We'll see what city has the biggest pig.  Bang.  And we'll also see what city has the hottest girl in a naughty nighty.  That's why syndication rocks.  Yeah.  I mean, just imagine it's your city that has the hog show up for the contest.  Think of how modified you'd be. 
[00:18:30]  And just imagine the entire country making fun of your city because of your representation.  Your city.  Your city.  It's like, oh, I walk around my city all the time.  I see the hottest chicks, and this one has to represent us.  This is representing Columbus?  Mm-hmm.  Sean, what's going on?  Hey, yo, bro.  What are you guys doing?  What up?  Yeah, if you're talking about debunked contest, how about run around the park for Aaron?  Yeah, run around the park for Aaron didn't work very well. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah, the women's groups got a little pissed off.  They didn't like that one.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Lawyers didn't like that.  Yeah.  Run around the park for Aaron.  We're going to have Aaron run around Central Park, and the first guy that, what was it?  Pulled it?  It was like flag football or something.  Flag football, but instead of the flag, it was just a pair of panties, that's all.  Yeah, panties.  And she had to run, and if somebody was coming at her, she just had to run away from them.  We were just going to let this girl loose in Central Park, and the first girl to find 
[00:19:30]  her, and just pull the panties off her.  Run around the park for Aaron.  Right, I remember that one.  They didn't like the acronym that was involved in that one.  No, they didn't really like that one.  We weren't fully behind that one.  It was just one of those.  Nah, it was kind of a throwaway.  Yeah, it was one of our throwaway ideas.  That would have been fun, you know.  Yeah.  All right, thank you, Sean.  Peace.  Peace.  Daphna or Daphne?  Daphne.  Daphna.  Daphna?  Daphna.  Hey, what's up?  Daphna.  That means you like it in Daphna.  In Daphna.  Daphna. 
[00:20:00]  You done?  Do you?  No, actually we weren't, but okay.  Hey, Daphna.  Yeah, what's up?  What do you want?  I want to come in the studio because I want to enter the contest.  I'm going to be away.  Wait, you want to do a little preliminary thing?  Yeah, I want to come in today.  You want to open it up?  Hey, guess what?  Contest starts today.  After all that, we're going to change it.  Contest starts today, Daphna.  The contest is on.  Ladies, get your asses down here. 
[00:20:30]  Between now and 7 today and then tomorrow between 3 and 7.  So I can come in?  Come on down.  All right.  Don't we usually have some kind of a little, we'll give a prize package, a little incentive  thing to the first girl that does show up?  I still got to take a train into the city, but it's all good.  If you show up, we'll make it worth your while.  The first girl.  The first girl that shows up for this contest, Daphna.  And we'll take your pictures.  Contest starts today.  What the hell?  Why wait?  Why wait?  Yeah, why wait?  See? 
[00:21:00]  Daphne.  All right.  Where are you taking the train from?  From Long Island.  Long Island.  Where are you from?  South Shore, right?  Yep.  Yeah.  You're like a Massapequa Park type of girl.  A little bit closer to the city.  Elmont?  No.  Rockville Center.  No.  This means nothing to the guy in Seattle.  He's like, who cares?  Well, then they can hunt me down.  See, there you go.  All right.  Well, get on a train and get down here, right?  Okay.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  South Shore, Long Island chicks, man.  Can't beat them, right? 
[00:21:30]  Although you want to.  You know, a lot of people are talking about this.  Let's get this out of the way before we take our first break.  Adam Farrar didn't even tell us that he did this for us last night.  My pal, look at what he did on the job last night.  Chris, what's going on?  Yo, I was just calling to see if you noticed the WOW sticker.  Yeah.  The job.  Right by the desk.  The job premiered last night on ABC with Anthony's childhood friend, Adam Farrar.  Sure.  He's now all of ours pals or whatever.  That's right. 
[00:22:00]  What the hell am I trying to say today?  And, yeah, one of the opening shots is a WOW sticker right on his desk.  Yeah, he's sitting at his desk there in the precinct and right on the wall at his desk.  There's a WOW sticker right there.  My pal.  Pretty sweet.  The famous WOW bumper sticker.  Yeah.  That's some nice exposure.  Hell, yeah.  Does Adam win a prize now?  Do we have to send him to the Royal Rumble?  Yeah.  That pretty much is the best exposure of a WOW, man.  Second best ever.  Second best ever.  Second best ever because of the live WOWing on the Today Show. 
[00:22:30]  Yeah.  That's going to be a tough one to beat.  If someone beats that, though, we'll come up with some cold hard cash.  Mm-hmm.  But, yeah, Adam Farrar taking care of us last night, Chris.  That's for sure.  Yeah.  All right.  You got it wrong.  A true friend of the show.  Of course.  He taped his little special for Comedy Central.  What's in the background?  A cooler with O&A on it.  Wow.  Yeah.  He's always thinking about his guys here.  Well, you know something?  Got to take care of each other.  That's how it works.  Friends.  Buddies. 
[00:23:00]  Chums.  Romans.  Country.  Hey, Mike.  What's going on?  Hey, what's up, man?  I want to know what yambags in Washington are saying you're doing so bad.  Everybody I know listens to y'all.  Well, yeah.  Well.  We like to think that, but there's really no proof of that yet.  Well, who are they asking?  How do they make the ratings up?  It's nice to hear.  They also think there's a Loch Ness Monster, so.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, my goodness.  A boogeyman.  Well, I mean, they let the other.  My boy.  They don't advertise you at all on the radio here.  You get no exposure from the radio station you're on. 
[00:23:30]  They advertise the other two DJs before you all all the time.  Well, we're moving forward, and we'll see what happens.  Opie, I hear they don't actually have proof of our listeners, but there are some big plaster  footprints that were made up of what they believe to be our listeners.  I'm not that big.  And some fuzzy video of some guy was taking on horseback, and he fell off, and he actually  got one of our listeners walking away, and he looked right into the camera before walking  off into the woods.  Oh, man.  I'm not that big. 
[00:24:00]  Well, that cottage could have been taken anywhere in D.C.  What do you got coming down to D.C.?  Jesus.  Hey, come on.  It's not like they deserve a little ripping.  Thank you, Mike.  All right, man.  Bye.  Bye.  Wow.  Yeah.  Hey, come on.  We're coming down, man.  There you go.  Right into the belly of the beast.  All right.  So that's what's going on today.  We'll get into some fine stuff as well.  Did you see that?  It's speaking quickly about the Martin Luther King day coming up. 
[00:24:30]  The plaque?  They are trying to pawn this thing off like it was a typographical error.  There was somebody at the plaque factory that just really did something awful.  They were trying to what?  Here it is.  They were trying to honor James Earl Jones.  James Earl Jones.  Right.  They were honoring James Earl Jones at a Florida celebration of the Martin Luther King.  They got a picture of his stamp on the plaque. 
[00:25:00]  And they're honoring James Earl Jones on Martin Luther King Day.  They make up a plaque.  It's got a picture of the Martin Luther King stamp.  And then below it, it says, thank you, James Earl Ray.  James Earl Ray, the guy that killed Martin Luther King.  It says, thank you, James Earl Ray, for keeping the dream alive.  You know, that canned laughter is going to get us in a lot of trouble these days. 
[00:25:30]  What is that?  They're saying that it was a typographical error.  Merit Industries who put the plaque together.  No disrespect was meant in any way.  It was an honest error.  Get out of town.  How do you confuse Jones with Ray?  If you're making that up, you know, a typographical error might be John's or something like that. 
[00:26:00]  It's different letters.  Right.  Completely different letters.  Ray.  James Earl Ray.  You would have to search out different letters in this case.  Very calculated.  It's not like you just scrambled them differently.  We were very upset, said Gerald Wilcox, owner of the people that ordered the plaque for the city.  We wanted to find out how the mistake of this magnitude could occur and try to determine if it was deliberate or not.  It was deliberate. 
[00:26:30]  Somebody.  Working at the plaque factory.  What a doodle.  The grease man working at the plaque factory.  I thought I'd do a little joke.  Martin Luther King.  I put the picture right here.  Well, I'm not in radio anymore.  I got to put to work at the plaque factory.  I was slinging back a few bone dries when all of a sudden I looked at James Earl Jones.  Then I said, what the hell? 
[00:27:00]  Let me just change it to James Earl Ray.  It's a little bit of the grease man humor back again in D.C.  Were you packing your heat?  Waddle doodle.  A slinging lead there.  Packing heat like I was with the D.C.  Police Department there.  Waddle doodle bone dry.  That does sound like a little grease man wacky bit, doesn't it?  Hey, what?  What do you mean I'm fired?  It's not like I played a laugh track over the Hogan's Heroes guy, yeah? 
[00:27:30]  Thank God we have ratings in New York.  Well, there you go.  A little error.  All right.  I think we need grease man on our show to help us in Washington, Anthony.  Do you think so?  Well, maybe he'll have to join us a few times.  All right.  The Naughty Nighty Contest starts Tuesday on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Starts today! 
[00:28:00]  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  Lots of instant feedback coming in.  Go to opiandanthony.com for the link for instant feedback.  Dan from Hoboken writes,  Keys and Bindings?  Wow, in a year you'll also give out polls.  Yeah, those polls will be right there with the polls.  Be patient.  Todd from Buffalo.  Has Buffalo been listening long enough to abuse us? 
[00:28:30]  Well, you know something?  They gave us great numbers, so yeah, they can do whatever the hell they want.  It's kind of scary how much they get our show.  I like it.  Todd from Buffalo writes,  I hope to God this works better than the O&A Halloween costume contest.  Oh, yeah.  That kind of sucked.  Oh, yeah.  And Mel from D.C. writes,  O&A are a couple of immature pricks who have a radio show for their own amusement. 
[00:29:00]  Oh, that should make a promo because that's perfect.  Is that it?  I'm just hoping not too many people get on to us.  Is that all they wrote?  Then he says, there's nothing else to listen to in D.C., so I'm slowly going insane listening to these post-adolescent a-holes.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  We do have a radio show for our own amusement.  Yeah, if you want to listen in, then we're here for you.  That's how bad radio got. 
[00:29:30]  Yeah.  Hey, Mike, what's going on?  Mikey!  Yeah.  Hello.  You're on the radio.  What's up?  Hey, man.  What's going on?  What's happening?  I'm calling from New Orleans.  New Orleans.  How are you doing?  Good, man.  Hey, I just got turned on to you.  I've seen your ad on one of the wild card games this weekend.  Oh, yeah?  And I've been listening to you since Monday, man.  About time we get some radio down here, man.  Radio sucks down here, man.  You guys are great.  Wait, it was a TV ad for our show?  Yeah, right during one of the wild card games. 
[00:30:00]  Maybe advertising does work.  God bless New Orleans, man.  Isn't that great?  You saw an ad for our radio show on TV and said, hmm, I should check that out?  Oh, hell yeah, man.  Look at that.  Look at that.  How the hell does that happen?  We need something down here, and you guys are the answer.  Well.  Hey, I'd like to give a shout out.  There's a girl there.  You might want to check out if she's listening for that naughty on.  Naughty 90 content?  It starts today, by the way, ladies.  Starts today.  Hey, I'm originally from Philly. 
[00:30:30]  She's in Philly, so if she's listening, her name is Paula, man.  She needs to go check it out.  She's 5'2", about 110 pounds with 38 Ds.  Great.  Ooh.  And I've just seen her down.  She came down here to visit right before Thanksgiving.  Yes.  And I've seen her in a naughty 90.  So, man, she needs to get up there, and you guys need to check it out because she's going to win it.  How did you see her in a naughty 90?  Well, we were good friends from back home, and she came down to visit me,  and we did some partying on Bourbon Street, and once in a while, when you party on Bourbon Street,  strange things happen.  Ah, we'll find that out. 
[00:31:00]  So, uh...  Did you bump uglies with her or what?  What's that?  Did you do the deed with her?  Oh, hell yeah, man.  There you go.  Hell yeah.  You know, sir, Bourbon Street, I normally don't go to strip clubs,  but I went to one on Bourbon Street when I was down there performing at colleges,  and I actually finished during a lap dance.  Did you?  The only time it's ever happened was in the world.  Yeah, it's pretty cool down here as far as that goes.  There you go.  So you got that going for you down there.  Which is nice.  Which is nice.  All right, Mike.  All right, man, keep rocking. 
[00:31:30]  We'll try.  Is it true we're going to talk to Buddy Epson a little later today?  Is it today we're talking to him?  How cool is that?  Four o'clock, Buddy Epson?  How cool is that?  We get the Well Doggie for the year 2002?  Thank God.  We have the other three.  We got three.  I just want to hear what the newest Buddy Epson Well Doggie sounds like.  Faithful listeners are screaming yes, yes, yes.  Oh, yeah.  We're so excited.  It's going to happen today.  We got the Well Doggie, the nice one, all the way up to the Well Doggie. 
[00:32:00]  Well, now we got to do it.  Where's all our Well Doggies?  I know.  The whole Well Doggie phenomenon started when we were up in Boston a few years back.  We interviewed Buddy Epson when he was about 88.  Now I think he's like 95 or so.  We'll find out how old he is today.  He's got to be.  He's in his 90s.  I know that for sure.  He's in 93.  93?  Wow.  Ben's got the Well Doggie 2001.  All right, we need the first Well Doggie, which is the one where he sounded good.  That was just before he got fired, so that's like 97-ish. 
[00:32:30]  Yeah.  And then you got Well Doggie 2000.  I got Well Doggie 2001.  Okay.  All right.  Let's hear the good one.  This is from 1997 when he was about 88 years old or so.  Well Doggie.  Nice.  Listen to that.  It sounds just like the Jed.  We remember the Jed Clampett from the Beverly Hillbillies saying Well Doggie.  Very smooth and he had some nice timing.  Listen.  Well Doggie.  All right.  Doesn't that sound just like it was taken from the show?  That was what?  How many years ago? 
[00:33:00]  About 97.  Yeah, 97.  And then I have the one from...  2000.  2000.  Something happened to his voice.  Well Doggie 2000.  Well Doggie 2000.  Well Doggie.  All right, so...  Yeah, wait, wait.  Well, here's about 1997.  Well Doggie.  Wait, Dick.  You wrecked it, Rick.  You wrecked the whole bit, Dick.  You wrecked it.  1997, Well Doggie.  Well Doggie. 
[00:33:30]  And then we got this one.  Well Doggie.  And then the last one was last year.  Yeah, we just heard it because Rick decided that we needed to hear it there.  Well, who goes back in time?  So here's Well Doggie 2001.  Well Doggie.  Oh.  It's not even close.  Once again, the first one was great.  A cropped, my kid.  Yeah, we'll get...  Oh, and then we'll do the Buddy Sings, too. 
[00:34:00]  Yeah, but I want to do the Well Doggie's again.  97.  You had it right in front of you, dude.  I love the original one.  It's just right off the show.  Now one after another.  97.  Boom.  Well Doggie.  Now we got 2000.  Well Doggie.  2001.  Well Doggie.  Well Doggie 2002.  15 minutes a day.  I cannot wait to hear Buddy saying Well Doggie.  And you know what?  Can I hear Buddy Epson singing?  Because we're going to ask him again today. 
[00:34:30]  Use it or lose it.  We're going to ask him to sing the theme song again today.  Oh, boy.  We had no idea this was going to happen.  Maybe it was just an off day for Buddy.  Listen to this really fast.  Come and listen to the story about a man named Jed, a poor mountaineer.  Barely kept his family fed.  And then one day.  Oh, he never.  I'm still writing it. 
[00:35:00]  When people.  I'm sorry.  It's so uncomfortable.  Tried to lighten it up with a moment of humor there.  Isn't that great?  I'm still writing it.  I'm sorry.  Buddy has a new CD out, by the way.  Yeah.  And that's what I guess he's selling.  Cool.  So that ought to be cool.  God bless him, man.  Mary Jo from Philly.  What's going on?  Yo, what's up?  Hey.  I thought you guys were going to be at the Freak Museum on next Friday. 
[00:35:30]  Next Friday.  Next Friday 25th.  The Mudder Museum, right?  The Mudder Freak.  Same thing.  Yeah, that's going to be our home.  Jim, I love you.  Thank you.  I cannot wait to see you.  Are you going to be there?  Yes.  Oh, right.  Yeah, you guys come down to the station like you did last time, all right?  To the station?  Yeah, a lot of people were hanging outside the station the whole time we were broadcasting.  And then you're going to the Freak Museum.  No, this is the deal.  We're doing the Mudder Museum early Friday.  Okay, what time?  I don't know.  And then we're going to talk about when we're on the radio live in Philly.  Okay.  The Meat Dare Museum. 
[00:36:00]  All right.  And then after the radio show, we go check out Jim Norton's two sold-out gigs.  Jimmy, how tall are you?  Me?  Yeah.  5'11".  How much do you weigh?  One.  Wow, we call it a radio show?  165?  How about you?  Obie.  We're about the same size.  Oh, yeah?  About 6'1", and about 165.  Cool.  Why?  You think we're fat?  I do.  Most radio guys are fat.  We're not fat.  Not fat.  P-H-A-T.  And Jim Norton looks like he has the ninja. 
[00:36:30]  No, Jim is just the top of the ball right there.  And Jim looks like he has the ninja.  Thank you.  Ninja.  I think I want a drink from all your mules.  Really?  And we think we want you to.  All right, well, I can't wait to see you.  I hope I see you in person.  Wait, Jim, how tall are you?  Huh?  I'm about 5'7".  5'7", weigh about what?  About 50?  150 max, yeah.  Yeah.  And he doesn't even have a hint of a muscle on his whole body.  Oh, I like that.  I slap that shit and start jiggling.  Christopher Reeve's thigh. 
[00:37:00]  All the muscle tone of...  That's what my torso looks like.  Oh, is that horrid?  I listen to you guys every day.  I love it.  I'm cracking my ass off every day.  Oh, yeah.  We'll crack that ass off.  I love it.  You can if you want, baby.  Hey, you know that...  What do you look like if I get it?  How tall are you?  I'm 5'5".  Yeah.  I weigh 120 pounds.  Mm-hmm.  My hair is long.  It goes down almost to my butt.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  I don't want to ask any more because I'm going to be disappointed. 
[00:37:30]  That's nice.  I like that.  That's good.  I'm going to meet you guys if it kills me.  All right, Mary Jo.  Definitely.  We'll see you until a week or tomorrow.  Cool.  Go Flyers, baby!  Woo!  What?  Did she say Flyers?  Wow, look at her.  Now we've got a problem.  She likes drinking from mules and hockey?  Come on.  How bad of a girl could she be?  Now we've got a problem.  It's pretty good, I think.  Yeah.  I can't wait to go to that museum.  What?  I've been being sent links to the website for some of the things at that museum.  The giant colon, Opie. 
[00:38:00]  We are going to see a giant segment of a man's colon that is, it's as big as, what the hell  would it, like a large dog is inside his colon.  And it's in a big glass case.  It's a large intestine.  Swelled up with red meat and other stuff.  Ugh.  Come on.  You know, Mr. Slackman, Tim Sabian called.  He wanted us to, he wanted to know what part of the museum we want to go to.  Because I guess the place is really big.  Yeah, we want.  I said, I want to go see the Pickled Punks.  Yeah. 
[00:38:30]  And what was the other thing?  He asked if we wanted a tour, right?  We want a guide.  And we're like, hell yeah, we want a guide.  And we want to go to the places that maybe some of the exhibits have been shut down.  Yeah, maybe the stuff behind the scenes.  Maybe the stuff they got in the basement that they can't bring up upstairs.  Like Elvis' turd.  Elvis' last turd in the jar at Graceland.  You don't see that on the tour, but we all know it's there in the basement.  That's right.  Elvis, he died on the ball.  Yeah.  Sounds sick F.  He decided to take his, you know what, put it in the jar.  Take that last turd. 
[00:39:00]  And it's in the basement.  And save it.  In the basement.  We called Graceland begging them.  We wanted to go check it out.  You know what's in the back rooms at the Smithsonian?  We'll have to get a tour of the Smithsonian when we go to Washington.  Not only aliens.  John Dillinger's junk is in a jar because it was so huge.  Really?  They saved John Dillinger's junk.  The gangster.  Little museum tours.  They don't take the ordinary, you know, Joe Public. 
[00:39:30]  John Q. Public.  They don't take him down there.  So we can't wait to go to that museum.  The medical museum.  It'll be a lot of fun.  What else did Tim ask?  Tim was horrified.  Because I can't believe you guys want to go there.  Why wouldn't we?  Oh, yeah.  We want to go to Ben Franklin's where the house used to be.  Tim.  That's where he took us last time.  He took us to an empty lot through an alley that had a frame of the corners of a house and a roof line.  Four posts and a roof line. 
[00:40:00]  It wasn't even the original posts.  No.  It wasn't the original.  It was cement.  They reconstructed the outline of Ben Franklin's house.  It said here was where the printing press was.  No, it wasn't even that.  It said here is where we think was.  Yeah.  They're not even sure about that.  Even if the house is there, it would have sucked.  Who cares?  No, but at least in your mind you go, oh, wow, this has been Franklin's house.  He looked at that piece of wood.  Yeah, the guy with the guide looked out this window.  Cool.  That would have been good for 30 seconds. 
[00:40:30]  Yeah, but 30 seconds is better than good for no time.  I'd never think Tim didn't understand us and the program because he does absolutely.  He has faith in it and it's doing very well in Philly, but how could he not know we would  want to go to a place like that?  Like, why would he even ask?  I can't believe you guys want to go there and not say, oh, my God, I'm so psyched you  guys are going to get to go there.  And then he walks us through a mall and I go, uh, Tim, we have one of these back home.  Yeah, a mall. 
[00:41:00]  I'll buy the coffee.  Hey, in this coffee shop, they make a hell of a coffee.  Uh, Tim, we have Starbucks in New York, too.  And wearing Philly, you want a cheesesteak, guys?  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha,  here's where I bought my slacks.  Come on, slacks for everyone.  That's a little place.  I'm setting you all up.  It's a little place called Sizes Too Small.  One size too small.  Take us to a Starbucks and Ben Franklin's outlined house.  Walking around with his Tim Sabian wedgie.  Yeah, that wedgie.  He had good cheeks, though. 
[00:41:30]  They're like two lima beans.  His underpants are too small, so he had a butt within a butt.  Yeah, he had the butt within a butt.  He had smaller butt in the middle of his butt.  If Tim Sabian's wife is listening, he needs bigger underpants.  Yeah, get him bigger underpants and get him a size up in his pants.  We couldn't stop looking at his cheeks.  That's all we looked at.  It was ridiculous.  Sabian's cheeks.  I was gay, man, but it was much more entertaining than the Ben Franklin experience. 
[00:42:00]  Big supple.  You know, I've said this so many times while just cruising pornographic websites.  I go, I am so goddamn heterosexual.  Because I look and I just love the female nude form.  It's a beautiful thing.  But, yeah, we could not take our eyes off of Tim Sabian's ass the entire day because it was like a freak show.  He had the ass within an ass and the too tight underpants and the wedgie caused by the slacks that were too small. 
[00:42:30]  I bet his underpants look like a huge shoeshine rag.  He's going to be wearing big Yo MTV Raps baggies.  Next time we see him.  Next time we see him.  Oh, I'm looking forward to that museum.  That's going to be fun.  It's Paul from the NYPD checking in.  Paul, what's up?  Yeah, you know, you guys are talking about the Freak Museum in Philly.  In the morgue on 34th Street and 1st Avenue in Manhattan, they have a museum similar to that. 
[00:43:00]  They have the basketball baby kid born with no spine.  And if I'm not mistaken, it's been 19 years since I've been there, but they had some guy's junk.  Because he urinated on a third rail on the train station there.  But it's one of those things that, you know, rookie cops get to see it, medical examiners get in there.  But as I recall, they still have it going on.  How about guys with a popular radio show?  I love all that freaky stuff. 
[00:43:30]  I would love to check that out.  Yeah, well, you know, I guess you guys can go down and check it out.  I work in the Bronx.  There's got to be a couple of cops in Manhattan who can probably hook that up for you.  Cool.  Yeah, we'll try to figure it out.  Thanks, Paul.  All right.  Take care, fellas.  All right.  This guy's friend saw Dillinger's junk, said it was 22 inches long.  Rob, what's up?  Ah, same BS, man.  Yeah.  So what's up?  Hey, a friend of mine went to D.C.  Uh-huh.  He went through the Smithsonian when he displayed it. 
[00:44:00]  And he said they had a tape measure there.  It was 22 inches long.  Imagine that on a white guy.  22 inch long Dillinger junk.  Yeah.  We had a guy in the studio once that had like a...  How big was that thing, man?  That was ridiculous.  I don't know.  He said he had a 14.  It was back at 14.  Way more than 14, my brother.  But he kept pulling on it.  No.  He's like tugging it down and sticking it to the side of his leg.  He had...  He had...  Disgusting, man.  He had what? 
[00:44:30]  Those tights on, those...  He had bicycling shorts.  And it went all the way down to his knee.  But he would pull it down.  Supposedly at the world's largest you-know-what.  The tight pants would hold it in place after he tugs another few inches out of it.  It was still down to his knee.  Oh, I'm not saying the guy wasn't packing a huge mule.  The girls were very impressed that we're in this studio.  Notice I say there were girls in this studio.  And that's the purpose of why the guy was in this studio.  But he just kept, like, tugging on it. 
[00:45:00]  That's probably why Tim wears his slack so snugly.  Maybe.  Makes his mule look just a little bit more delicious.  All right, Rob.  Dave, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Love the show.  Thank you.  Listen, you guys play that bit all the time with Buddy Epson singing the theme song there?  Yeah.  I listened to that song when you guys originally did it.  He was singing a dirty version.  That's why he couldn't remember it.  Regardless of what the hell he was singing, he couldn't remember anything. 
[00:45:30]  What, he told us he had a dirty version of the song?  Yeah.  It's still funny.  Don't get me wrong.  I love it every time I hear it.  But, yeah, it was supposed to be a dirty version.  That's why he said he was still writing it.  Well, listen to it again.  I mean, there was nothing dirty about the part he sang.  I think what...  No, he was trying to remember it.  And that's why he screwed it up.  It's still hysterical.  Don't get me wrong.  I love it every time I hear it.  He was trying to sing a parody version of it, I believe.  Exactly.  There you go.  Well, we'll listen to it again as we go to break. 
[00:46:00]  And when we get back, Buddy Epson with Well Doggy 2002.  Hey, I love you guys.  Who's doing better radio today?  No one.  Check this out again.  Come and listen to the story about a man named Jack, a poor mountaineer, barely kept  his family fed.  And then one day...  Oh, he...  But he never...  I'm still writing it.  When people...  I'm sorry.

Plus, you'll be a star because people all over the country will be checking out you and your Naughty Nighty.  Okay.  It's going to be like an internet kind of thing?  Yeah, we put all the contestants up on the website.  Then our listeners decide, the finalists, and then finally decide who is the hottest Naughty Nighty girl.  All right.  Sounds good to me.  So come on down, all right?  Okay, great.  Thanks, guys.  We need some girls to come down and kick off this contest the right way. 
[00:48:00]  Beautiful.  I'm down.  We'll see you tomorrow.  Okay, bye-bye.  All right.  Bye.  Dude, I hate public bathrooms.  Oh, you just...  There's nothing you can't...  It's like I'm relaxing, enjoying a little log displacement.  Yeah.  And then you have to hear somebody else papering their seat, and it's like, just get out of here.  I know.  You still haven't...  I did a little bit, yeah.  Finally?  Yeah.  Pinched off a little?  Yeah.  Nicely shaped and textured, I might add.  Yeah.  It's like, get out of here, man. 
[00:48:30]  I'm trying to enjoy myself.  Seriously, it drives me nuts.  You can't even read.  Are you a quiet guy or a loud guy that doesn't care?  I'm nuts, man.  I have to be in a alone environment.  Same with me.  Some people are amazing.  I can't make any noise because I'm embarrassed, even though the...  Yeah.  You can work it out where the person never even sees you, because you can wait for them  to leave.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  But there are guys that have no shame.  They don't even care.  They just...  Oh.  Just disgusting.  But the noise is the...  Oh.  I'm always embarrassed. 
[00:49:00]  Worse than that.  Besides the noise of the act, they have to, you know, accent it.  I envy people that can just go anywhere.  Yeah.  Isn't that great?  I can't either.  I want to be alone.  I don't want anybody to know what I'm doing.  Why do I have shame with it?  I don't know why.  I need privacy myself, Norton.  I feel the same way.  I have some audio of the guy right next to you in the stall just moments ago.  We had a little microphone in there.  We're going to get through this. 
[00:49:30]  We're going to turn this thing around.  Let's just stick with me.  At first, we'll turn this thing around.  He's talking to himself.  We're going to get through this, though.  We've just got to keep your chin up.  Yeah.  It just drives me nuts.  We have a show for our own amusement.  Man.  In the middle of my book, enjoying a good chapter, and I hear, like, the little...  Of the toilet protector being taken out.  God, that annoys me. 
[00:50:00]  We're going to get through this.  We're going to turn this thing around.  You guys are dicks.  Isn't that awful?  Hey, look who's on the phone.  I think Washington is involved with our syndication to enlighten us.  Yeah.  That guy's right.  We have a radio show to amuse ourselves. 
[00:50:30]  Yeah.  Buffalo's not teaching us that lesson.  Hey, look who's on the phone with us right now.  Buddy Epson!  Hey!  Hey, Buddy!  Hey, a little doggie to you.  How's our buddy, Buddy?  Hey, usually you pick up the phone and people say to me, what's new?  My songs are new.  I want to talk about my songs.  Oh, yeah.  I hear you have a CD out, Buddy.  I got a CD. 
[00:51:00]  I hear you have a copy of some of them.  Yes, I was actually listening to the one about the, we're all together on one spaceship, or...  What's that one called, Buddy?  We're all riding on the same spaceship.  We're all riding on the same spaceship.  And are you singing?  That's better.  Are you singing?  Yeah, I take it on the, also, I got a little help from some other people.  Right.  And it's quite an exciting piece. 
[00:51:30]  Have you played it?  We're going to listen to it right now.  I was listening to some in the office.  Why don't I get up here and let the people hear it?  All right, but no, no, no, no.  Well, no, you don't go anywhere, Buddy.  Hold on, we've got to get just a couple things out of you there, Buddy.  Yeah.  It's a new CD out, and you can find it off BuddyEpson.com, right?  Yeah.  All right, don't you go anywhere, though, Buddy.  We want to talk to you.  Okay.  All right.  Hey, Buddy, how old are you now?  How old am I?  Funny you should ask. 
[00:52:00]  Ah, ha, ha.  Yeah, when I'm sitting on the front porch, and a pretty girl walks by, and my pacemaker  starts to open the garage door.  Oh, hey!  Look at that one!  That's an idea of how old I am.  I like that.  But anyway, as long as she keeps opening the door, that's fine.  That's right. 
[00:52:30]  That's right.  You've still got a lot of spunk there, Buddy, don't you?  I'm thinking you're like 95, Buddy.  What?  I think you're 95 years old, huh?  How old?  95?  Uh, not 95 yet.  I don't think so.  I don't keep score.  Yeah.  I just, you know, I live by one axiom, use it or lose it.  Use it or lose it.  We got that one.  We got that one.  Of course.  You got that?  I like that.  We like that from you.  Buddy, can I ask a favor of you?  Oh, no. 
[00:53:00]  Okay.  I, of course, your beloved character, Jed Clampett from the Beverly Hillbillies, we all remember  it, lives on in syndication on, where is that being played now?  That Nickelodeon, maybe?  That Nickelodeon.  All of it.  Yeah.  Nickelodeon, yeah.  We love it.  And you did the Well Doggy back then.  Can we hear a little Buddy Epson saying, Well Doggy?  Well, I usually use that for my get-off line. 
[00:53:30]  Yeah.  When we're all through talking, I'll give you, you know, Well Doggy's.  Well, I just want to hear it all.  One run right now?  Yeah.  Yeah, because we'll get off another one.  Okay, you ready?  Yeah, let's hear it.  Well Doggy's.  All right.  Nice.  Hey.  Just like I remember from Buddy Epson.  Pretty good.  That's not bad at all, Buddy.  Now, Buddy, this CD you got out.  Is this a new CD?  Yeah.  Well, it's on Buddy Epson's Originals. 
[00:54:00]  Now, this is a song that you recorded a few years back?  Yes, you recorded it and re-recorded it and smartened it up a little bit so that it sounds  better.  Oh, I got you.  It's available on springboundmusic.com.  Oh, look at you all over the web.  Springbound.com.  On the web.  Or buddyepson.com on the web.  All right.  Or a phone call for 888-280-7715. 
[00:54:30]  All right, Buddy's doing business.  I like that.  I see you on the front page of buddyepson.com.  We see you in a little Santa hat for Christmas with a saxophone.  With a saxophone?  Very cute picture there, Buddy.  Hey, Buddy, you got a gal in your life?  Yeah.  I played the saxophone since I was in high school.  All right.  And that's where I graduated at Tech Spedicky.  I worked with him for a while. 
[00:55:00]  Let me read the caption.  Buddy playing a saxophone Christmas 2001.  Yes.  Yeah, yeah.  Mr. Epson, if people order your CD from eatabullet.com, how many songs are on it?  No, that's buddyepson.com, Nord.  Buddyepson.com.  This is a...  How many songs do you say?  You idiot.  There are 14 on the CD.  And the favorite turns out to be something I wrote from a two-and-a-half-year-old granddaughter  called Angelica.  Did you hear that one?  I didn't hear that one. 
[00:55:30]  We're going to have to give that a listen.  Well, I'll give you the first line.  All right.  Okay.  Who put the jam on the pussycat's tail?  Who put the grease on the banister rail?  Who put cement in the scrubbing up pail?  Who?  Angelica!  Who broke the milk bottle out on the drive?  Who squeezed the goldfish until they aren't alive?  Who spilled their mommy's Chanel No. 5?  Who? 
[00:56:00]  Angelica!  Angelica!  Very good.  All right, buddy.  Hey, I like that.  Do you have any grandchildren?  No, not yet, buddy.  I'm hoping to have my first grandchild very soon.  We're still working on kids, possibly.  You'll remember that song when you get a grandchild.  I'm going to listen to them.  They have a way of getting into things.  Yeah, I bet they do.  They cause a ruckus around the house, right? 
[00:56:30]  A little bit of a ruckus.  Buddy, you got great-grandkids?  What?  You have great-grandkids?  Any great-grandchildren?  Oh, no, no.  Not that I know of.  Oh, hey, back in the day.  They may be keeping something from me, but I don't know of any.  Buddy, can you sing a line from another song on your CD, maybe?  A couple of little verses?  A couple of verses of what?  Any of the other songs that we can find on your CD?  Oh, I got a lot of songs. 
[00:57:00]  Oh, you want some character songs like Wild Card or Baby Blues or...  Oh, well, any.  Snowshoe Thompson.  How about Snowshoe Thompson?  Yeah, let's hear that.  Snowshoe Thompson.  You want to hear a little of that?  Yeah, let's hear a little of that from Buddy Hudson.  All right, here we go.  Snowshoe Thompson used to carry the mail through wind and thunder, snow and hail.  He had no dogs and he had no sled, but one thought drove him straight ahead.  Go, man, go. 
[00:57:30]  Got to get on through the snow.  Mush, man, mush.  Got to get on through the snush.  Go, man, go.  Means mush and Eskimo.  So go, man, go, man, go, man, go.  Yeah!  And the road's just flooding.  The line is down and the bird is walking on the ground.  And the snow is ripped the treetop tall and nobody getting through at all.  Hello, go, man, go.  It goes on like that.  Oh, yeah, it goes on like that.  Nice one, Buddy.  Very good, Buddy.  And it's all available on Buddy's CD. 
[00:58:00]  Hey, Buddy, man.  It's got a lift on the last chorus.  Yeah.  So remember now when your day is grim and the drift is tall and your hopes are slim and  you don't see how you're going to get through old snowshoe made it and so can you.  So go, man, go.  Got to get on through the snow.  There we are.  A little lesson to be learned.  There you go.  A lesson to be learned.  There you go, Buddy.  Don't quit.  It's inspirational.  Hey, Buddy, last time you were on our show, you were singing a dirty version of the Beverly 
[00:58:30]  Hillbillies theme.  A dirty version.  It was kind of a saucy, saucy little parody version of that.  The closest thing to a dirty version.  Of course, I sang a song from the hillbillies called, Well, doggies, well, doggies, well,  doggies, well, doggies, yeah, doggies, yeah, doggies, yeah, doggies, yeah, doggies, oh, doggies, 
[00:59:00]  oh, doggies, oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, it goes on like that.  It goes on like that, Buddy.  What?  It goes on like that then, huh?  It goes on like that.  That's the kind of lyrics they're writing today.  Right, that's what the kids are listening to.  Hey, I got an idea.  Buddy, could you do that again?  I want to help you along with that song.  You want to help me along with it?  Yeah, hold on.  I'll tell you.  Well, I got parts of it.  I'll tell you when.  Hold on, hold on.  I like that, what was that, the Well Doggy song? 
[00:59:30]  Yeah, well, a Well Doggy song.  Yeah, give us a little more of that.  A little more Well Doggy?  Yeah, do it again.  I haven't written a song about Well Doggy.  Well, do it again, because we won't.  But what I'll do, you'll hear it on springboundmusic.com.  Page out of the old plug book.  Yeah.  But I got a variation on Well Doggy.  All right.  Oh, you do.  Not Well Doggy, but another song that I wrote. 
[01:00:00]  All right.  And, oh, wait a minute.  Did you get the phone number in case you can't get the book?  Oh, yeah.  We got the phone number.  You want to give it out again, buddy?  888-280-7715.  There you go.  And here is the middle part of the song.  Okay, let's hear.  The postman came the first of May.  The mailman came the very next day.  Nine months later, there was hell to pay. 
[01:00:30]  Who fired the first shot?  Blew in the grave.  Well, babies.  Well, babies.  Oh, I get you.  That's a little racy there, buddy.  Is that what you wanted?  Yeah.  Some war humor.  Yes, for something racy.  First hand.  That's as racy as I get.  That's as racy as you get?  Yeah.  Buddy, weren't you writing a parody version of the Beverly Hillbillies theme song?  A parody version?  What?  Well, I wrote another version of it.  It's not a parody.  Oh, okay.  It's inspired by the Ballad of Jed Clayton. 
[01:01:00]  See, that's what I think he was trying to do last time.  You'll get it when they send you the full CD.  Oh, can we hear a little bit of it from you live, maybe?  Well, I don't know.  It's so unique.  Yeah.  I don't care.  There's lyrics around in my head.  Ah, yeah.  We found that out last year.  Okay, well.  All right.  I got other lyrics, but they're songs that are talking songs, like they used to do on 
[01:01:30]  the radio, like smoke, smoke, smoke, you know, that kind of thing.  Right, right.  All right there, Buddy.  Hey, Buddy, we love you, man.  Well, thank you very much.  We're going to promote your CD.  I don't know what the name of the CD is.  The CD is Buddy's Originals.  Buddy's Originals.  Yeah.  You can go to BuddyEpson.com.  You can go to SpringBound.com. 
[01:02:00]  Yeah.  Or you can give Buddy a call, probably personally, at 888-888-280-7715.  7715.  7715.  Of course.  And don't forget, we're all riding on the same spaceship.  Ain't a time we start to get along.  Right.  As the world keeps shrinking, got to find new thinking, so the world can spin right on.  That's inspirational, Buddy.  Thank you so much. 
[01:02:30]  Okay.  Buddy at the great Buddy Epson.  Buddy's got to leave with his well-doggy.  That's how he leaves.  Oh, that's right.  One more time, Buddy.  If you could leave us with a great well-doggy.  Are you ready?  Yes, sir.  You got the recorder going?  Oh, of course.  Well, here it comes for you.  Hey, you got to really, you know, pump this one out for us.  I'll pump this one out.  Ready?  Here we go.  Well-doggy.  Thank you, Buddy Epson.  Buddy Epson.  Buddy Epson.  Nice.  Got a little out of stick here in the back. 
[01:03:00]  I heard that.  Thank you, Buddy.  It'll be again soon.  Thank you.  Oh, we will, Buddy.  Believe us.  We love you, Buddy.  Thank you.  Thank you.  We'll call you tomorrow.  Thanks.  All right.  The great Buddy Epson, everyone.  There's our brand new well-doggy for Buddy Epson for 2002.  For 2002.  And I don't think he, boy, he is something.  It's still kind of sharp there.  You got a lot of Opie to clap after he gave out a phone number.  That's not quite degrading to it. 
[01:03:30]  I was well-behaved.  Too condescending.  No, but of course you're well-behaved.  But the man gave out a number and you went, all right.  All right.  He can speak.  Let me tell you something.  I was looking at the phone lines.  There was this one girl.  She hung up.  It was Lisa.  Maybe she'll call back.  All Stinky wrote on the line is Lisa going, for the love of God, be  nice to him, be nice to him, be nice to him.  Please, please, please.  She was just freaking.  She was just freaking.  What is this?  The well-doggy 2002?  She just did it last.  Nice.  Can we now? 
[01:04:00]  All right.  We got to add it to our collection.  All right.  Do we have all of them?  We got to line them all up.  We got to line them up and get them all numbered.  Look at us being unpredictable.  See, you bastard.  You thought we were going to be mean.  See?  I know.  Exactly.  Just when you think you know your pals Opie and Anthony.  Some guy said, Buddy Ebsen rules.  Didn't he fight with Davy Crockett?  Like Mark from Cleveland.  I feel so bad.  Leave this guy alone.  We were very nice to him.  Even when we're nice, people freak out that we're even on the phone with him. 
[01:04:30]  Yeah.  They're turning down their radios going, oh, I know it's coming.  I know it's coming.  Not at all.  See?  Sometimes you see the, sometimes the lion walks right past the gazelle.  That's right.  You watch those nature shows sometimes, and you're watching it, and sometimes the lion  walks right past the gazelle, and the gazelle don't even stop drinking.  That's right.  And he walks by, and you're thinking, why the hell did he tear his throat out?  What about the...  You just can't tell what nature. 
[01:05:00]  What about the alligators and the crocs?  Ah, the alligators.  Inches away from the gazelles as they're drinking the water.  And the alligator mentions, oh, he turns off.  Turns away.  Not interesting.  And not interesting.  Just not interesting today.  Something as simple as you throw the mice in the snake tank.  Sometimes the snake don't even pay attention to the mouse.  Sometimes the mouse could just take a nice little nap.  And sometimes the snake plays a canned laughter over the mouse's story of his parents being  eaten by a snake.  You never know. 
[01:05:30]  All right.  I got Will Doggy 97, 2001, and 2002.  I got 2000.  Okay, so here we go.  Let's get this right.  You know what?  I'm kind of disappointed.  I think he made a nice comeback last year.  He did.  I think he made a nice comeback.  He did.  He did.  You got to give it to him.  Well, maybe next year.  All right.  Here's Will Doggy 1997 from the great Buddy Epson.  BuddyEpson.com.  Will Doggy.  Nice.  All right.  And here is the year after.  2000.  2000. 
[01:06:00]  2000 here.  Use it or lose it.  Well Doggy.  A little bad.  All right.  Here's Well Doggy 2001.  Well Doggy.  And ladies and gentlemen, we need like a drum roll.  We don't have one.  Here's Buddy Epson.  Well Doggy 2002.  Well Doggy.  All right.  Yeah.  He almost sounds better in this one than he did in the last one.  I would say definitely better.  Yeah.  This is last year, 2001. 
[01:06:30]  Well Doggy.  Sounds like a brake screeching on at fall.  2002.  Well Doggy.  Give me the 2001.  Give me last year again.  Well Doggy.  I'm like a car accident.  I was talking to one of these things earlier.  Oh.  Lisa.  Yes.  Hey.  Listen, I know the way you two operate, okay?  Why?  I've listened to you long enough.  I was just waiting for something from you, okay?  You were scaring me. 
[01:07:00]  I was yelling at the radio.  I know.  It was funny because you were on the line and all I saw was, please, please, please be nice  to him.  I was just yelling at whoever answered the phone, no, stop him, please, no.  Oh, we're not going to hurt Buddy.  We've been talking to Buddy for years.  I know.  And he's been nothing but nice to you guys.  Yes.  And I know the way you operate.  Good cop, good cop.  We don't want to be predictable, Lisa.  I know.  And that scares me.  Okay?  We don't want to be predictable.  I know.  But, you know, all Opie needs to do is play some soundbite and the man won't even understand  what's happening, okay?  Lisa, they had my hands tied behind my back. 
[01:07:30]  Good, good.  I'm glad someone there has some sense of decency.  I was in a straight jacket for that last 15 minutes.  Thank God.  My heart was, like, beating.  I'm like, no, please.  I love that.  Do you know how many great, great clips we got from Buddy just in that call along with  Buddy going, like, well, that's the one I want.  Can you get the well doggy song?  I like the way you made him say it a few times because you know he's not making it to 2003.  Well doggy, well doggy, well, Buddy says, buddy says, well doggy, well doggy, well, well 
[01:08:00]  doggy, doggy.  He was doing a well doggy rap.  And the doggy's getting in the back.  Oh, boy.  All right, Lisa.  Can I ask Norton a question?  Yes.  Um, I've been wanting for a couple years to have someone give me yellow discipline, but  every time I ask, they always, like, freak out and go, oh my God, no.  Oh, how do you get someone to actually believe that you want that? 
[01:08:30]  Well, funny you should ask.  Um, I don't know.  You just got to be involved enough with somebody where they know what a degenerate you are.  People tend to believe me because they know me.  And it's like, yeah, well, he's not joshing around this time.  What do you want to do?  Lay down in the bathtub, maybe?  No, on the bed.  On the bed.  On the bed?  I'm a novice.  The bathtub first.  No, no bathtub.  Go right for it.  Why?  Lisa, why would you be into something like that?  Is it kind of, um...  I don't know, but there's something about it.  Like, I really want it so bad.  Well, good girl.  You have a boyfriend? 
[01:09:00]  I'm sorry?  You have a boyfriend?  No.  Oh, Jesus.  Every time I ask him, it kind of really freaks him out.  Yeah, huh?  Funny you could call this show.  I mean, like, I don't understand.  I can, like, give him a rusty trombone.  That's fine.  But you ask someone to give you a yellow discipline and, like, whoa.  You want it all over you?  No, not all over.  I don't think the face.  I don't think that.  All right, so you're talking, like, all over your chest area.  Yeah.  And even below, kind of there?  Oh, yeah.  Makes you feel real dirty and naughty.  That's common for the novice, though. 
[01:09:30]  Avoid the face.  Like, you know, I've still got dignity.  At least I did the same thing.  I've still got dignity.  You go right for the chest and you figure, well, if my grandmother's looking down from heaven,  you know, she won't mind this that much.  And then you know what happens the next time?  You're like, go ahead, give me a gulletful.  That's what I figure.  I mean, it doesn't really disgust me if they slipped and, like, God, I really wouldn't care.  No, you wouldn't mind.  It's kind of like jumping into, like, a cold pool.  You just got to go for it.  None of this, like, putting my foot in first and stuff. 
[01:10:00]  So that gets you all worked up just thinking about it?  Oh, yes.  And every time Norton mentions it, I'm like, oh, my God.  Is it, like, because you want to be a dirty girl?  Well, I am.  I figure it.  I think I totally am.  You've given your boyfriend the rusty trombone?  Oh, yeah.  You know, we've got a lot of new cities.  They might not know what the rusty trombone is.  Well, we could tell them in song, Anthony.  Do we have that one?  Yeah, we'll get the song.  The rusty trombone is best with a filthy whore. 
[01:10:30]  I should be insulted, but for some reason I'm not.  No.  We don't know who you are personally.  We just know very limited things about you.  You like Buddy Epson, and you like the discipline.  That's about it.  And your name's Lisa, maybe.  Yeah.  All right.  I just want to, like, do you just, like, ask somebody, like, how did you do it?  Um, I work into it slowly.  Oh, okay.  How about you leave notes around?  Yeah, a little.  I buy a lot of yellow things.  I drink lemonade.  No, they just know me, man. 
[01:11:00]  I really know that I'm a perv, and I like it, and that's it.  So, if they're, most of them won't do it either.  They're like, yeah, I can't do that on a person.  Really?  Yeah, it's annoying.  You know what you do?  You know what would be really hot?  What?  You're with a guy.  You go in the shower with him, right?  Mm-hmm.  Okay?  Then lay down in the bathtub as the shower's running, and then use the S-S word for it,  and just go, on me.  Yeah, S-S on me.  Uh, no. 
[01:11:30]  No?  On me.  I'm talking like she's a novice, so I'm not talking a pro like you, Norton.  Stop with the shower.  Stop with the shower obsession, everybody.  Do it in the bed.  What are you going to do, then?  Go to sleep, and it's going to stink like that?  It goes on you, or maybe...  It goes on the bed.  I'm telling you.  No, it doesn't.  Oh, no.  No, it doesn't.  Oh, Jesus.  No, it doesn't.  She's not ready for that kind of step into it.  Yes, she is.  She's a little shy about it, but yes, she is. 
[01:12:00]  All right, Lisa.  Go.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you so much.  Godspeed.  Thank you.  Bye.  Dennis has a problem with our Buddy Epson interview.  Dennis?  Hey, let's remember you guys are being all, you know, proud that you guys weren't mean  to Buddy Epson.  Proud?  Well, sort of.  No, I just don't want to be predictable.  Let's remember the real reason why you guys started calling him was to get the last interview  before he died.  We gave up on that years ago, so we spun the bit differently.  You are so right. 
[01:12:30]  Wait, the first time we talked to him in 1997, that is what, now five years ago, we were  convinced he wasn't even going to make it to spring that year.  And we wanted the last interview with Buddy Epson, so we kept calling him, and who would  have thought we could have called so many other people to get that last interview?  Exactly, you morbid bastards.  You've got a good memory, but we spun it now.  We don't care about the last interview.  Exactly.  It's all about the ONA spin.  All right.  Very good.  Norton rules.  Thank you, sir.  Oh, indeed, brother.  Thank you.  Chris from Bridgeport is saying, Lisa's like Big Pussy from The Sopranos. 
[01:13:00]  Not in the face.  When they shot him on the boat.  Yeah.  Not in the face.  Anthony, a little song about the Rusty Tribe.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  A rusty trombone is best with a filthy whore. 
[01:13:30]  She'll reach around and get you off with her hand.  All the while, she'll hit your spot by your tiny balloon nut.  Hope you didn't eat too much bran.  A rusty trombone may not be moral.  While I think this sounds kind of gay, I'd rather get some oral with the finger up my  But that's me.  What the hell? 
[01:14:00]  I'm a nut.  Come on, honey.  Start the music.  Yeah.  You play that well.  The Naughty Nighty Contest starts Tuesday on the O.B. and Anthony Show.  Starts today.  N-E-W.

I was really scared.  I'm not scared.  Yeah.  Obviously, I'm not scared because he did it two years ago.  But, I mean, at the time, I was petrified.  He put me at ease and it was a piece of cake, okay?  He will answer all your questions.  So, make the phone call.  It doesn't cost you anything.  Talk to him.

The Opie and Anthony Show.  A couple phone numbers in the New York area.  877-692-1027. 
[01:15:30]  Anywhere else.  866-2774.  Wow.  Somebody threw a pie in Fred Durst's face.  Yeah.  Fred Durst and Limp Bizkit going around doing these find-a-new-guitarist thing.  You know?  Uh-oh.  Wacky radio bid alert.  So they, uh, they're going to all these guitar centers, I guess, and people are auditioning  for Limp Bizkit.  Is he going to go to Fenway Park to get his, uh, next guitars?  Yeah, that's pretty much what these things are all about. 
[01:16:00]  If you're going to one of these things, I don't think, um, I don't think you got much  of a chance of scoring, uh, with Limp Bizkit.  But, uh, some kid, I threw a pie in his face.  As he walked through the door.  Oh, my God.  Dude, how aggravated is Norton?  Dude, I...  What is your problem, man?  I don't, I don't like big perks when I hang out on the radio station.  I ask the intern, um, nice guy.  That's Kiss Ass. 
[01:16:30]  Or Brown Nose.  What are we calling him?  Kiss Ass.  Kiss Ass.  Could you go down anywhere but the Brooklyn Diner and get me, you know, because I like the  Brooklyn Diner, because I like to pay $275 for a bottle of Coke.  I mean, that's reasonable.  That's fair price.  So I asked him if he could go and get me a grilled chicken sandwich, but not there.  So, comes back from there with a nice $275 diet Coke.  And a grilled cheese.  Which, um, you know, it's rare that you actually wish John had gone for you. 
[01:17:00]  Yeah.  Um, but I can't eat grilled cheese, because I'm already a fat, dumpy little nothing.  I can't eat something that bad.  Pinch your fat.  Pinch your fat.  Look.  Pinch it.  Pinch it.  We went out to dinner the other night.  Yeah.  And he eats, he eats everything.  He's like a slob.  He has to have a dessert.  Oh, he does.  I know.  Yeah, I do.  He has to have, like, the fried cheese, whatever.  He don't care about his diet.  But most people will eat like that and not even think twice.  He eats all the bad food, the dessert and everything, and then gets mad at himself. 
[01:17:30]  Then he grabs his fat.  Just thing.  And pinches it as hard as he can and starts yelling at his fat.  It's not even yelling.  It's just a little, uh, like that noise.  We had to have that dessert there at Morton's.  Oh, it was so good.  That, uh, chocolate inside the chocolate cakey thing.  It was just a big chocolate mess.  Delicious, though.  Oh.  So good.  It's such a special dessert.  You've got to order it before your, uh, appetizer.  Yeah, before you even order your first drink.  Because it takes 45 minutes to an hour just to make it. 
[01:18:00]  For you.  That's right.  And I wound up scarfing another free dinner last night.  You dick stuff.  Just tagging along with Opie and Sandy and the agents, and I'm just standing there like  a little.  With the agent and his evil, evil, uh, twin.  Twin brother.  Looks like Latka's priest.  And I'm just standing there like a little hungry retard.  And they're like, all right, well, we'll feed you, too.  Feed him.  Then he doesn't go away.  Yeah, a little meaty-breasted mooch. 
[01:18:30]  Hey, Farrelly, get him in here.  He's out of his effing mind.  Our morning guy has stopped by.  Scott Farrell, who does mornings here in New York.  What's up, buddy?  We're going to the hockey game to drink heavily.  Look at him.  He's got a fabulous jersey on.  This is that hat he said I look like a dealer in.  Yeah, you look like a dealer.  Yellow hat.  What do you need?  What do you need?  20s, 20s, 30s, 30s, 40s?  What do you need?  What do you give me for?  20 bid, 20 bid, 30 bid.  We're going out to the hang.  I need a lid.  Yeah.  To the CA.  Rangers haven't won since Christmas. 
[01:19:00]  Yeah, Rangers having a bad time.  Go Islanders, baby.  You're a Devils fan?  No, the Devils gave me this one night when I did a gig at Double D's out in Morristown.  It wasn't a nudie joint back then.  We're glad it is now, though.  So I got this from Lyle Odeline.  I heard he was going to get traded back there.  Instead, they got Valerie Kaminsky.  He's like 80.  They sent him to Albany.  He's going to be a big help for them.  They've lost three in a row, and I've had more threats than they've had wins going over 
[01:19:30]  to the arena.  Hey, you could help us.  How much time you got?  I'm just hanging out with the boys.  We're stealing stuff from the back in the closet.  That's what we do every day to keep ourselves dressed.  We're supposed to give away Patriots tickets.  Oh, he's not going to.  I got a wow shirt on.  He's got a wow shirt.  I figure if I'm going to go get in a fight, I might as well represent, right?  Give up the body.  Let's get the O&A wow shirt on.  I love that.  I love the Devils jersey.  Who's this cat over here?  He's looking at me like I'm on acid.  That's Jim Noir.  Jim Noir.  What's happening, dude?  You were supposed to get him a chicken sandwich, and you got him a grilled cheese.  He's all pissed off now.  I believe him, man. 
[01:20:00]  I'd be seriously livid.  He's a pissed off individual right about now, man.  Hey, we got Patriots tickets to give away.  Yeah.  It's going to be rowdy up there, too.  Can you imagine at nighttime in such a lovely den of iniquity, Foxborough Stadium?  It's like a high school football field.  I know.  It's concrete, the ground.  Every tackle, there's going to be blood and mud.  Guys losing fingers like Ronnie Lott.  I like the Raiders in that game totally, I told you.  I'm serious.  And then I think the Steelers are going to get it on.  They're going to stop the run.  They're going to stop this Gerbach.  They're going to stick his head in the ground like they used to do to Brian Seip with Jack Lambert. 
[01:20:30]  And then I think Kurt Warner, he's going to snap like this.  30.  30.  Spaghetti.  30 Romeo.  I love my wife's bad hairdo.  She's got a mullet.  And then they're going to win by 30.  And then I think that the Bears are going to have everybody at Soldier Field drunk and high on chili.  And then they're going to coif in overtime. 
[01:21:00]  The Eagles are going to win.  And everyone in Chicago, there's going to be a four-foot blizzard.  And they're all going to go back to their miserable lives.  That's right.  You can take your windy city and your shoulders and your river you live by.  What is it, Lake Michigan toxic co-host swimming in?  Let's go fishing, Dad.  Here, let's catch some carp.  It's filled with suicide, son.  And it started as a football question.  Yeah.  I'm going to go to the Steeler game next week.  The last time I went and did that, I got beat up there, too. 
[01:21:30]  It was when the Broncos did them by like 40.  My dad punched me.  You're a boy, you smartass.  Your dad punched him.  Jim, you're scared of him, aren't you?  No.  He just wants his food.  No.  You just want your food.  Yeah.  He's aggravated, man.  You should see today, I beat up Blaine in here.  Did you?  I just started cranking him.  He got smart with me, so I beat him up.  Blaine is keeping you sane.  I think he's cool.  He's keeping, you know.  He's a funny guy.  He cracks me up.  He's keeping you employed.  The rest of the day, I'm miserable.  And I'm like yelling and screaming at people. 
[01:22:00]  I got threats.  I mean, and then when I'm in here, I'm usually just crying.  The dude, he's whacking that.  That Justin dude, he's painted his entire body with tattoos.  He's funny, too, that guy.  Who's that scary guy that hangs with you?  That's the guy that if anybody touches me, he's going to stab them.  Really?  Look at the size of him.  He's a scratch golfer, too.  What does he want?  And we think that the both of us can take you and your buddy there on the foosball table.  Oh, foosball?  Listen, I'm going to do you.  It's going to be unbelievable.  Hang out.  I don't even need to spin.  I'm like Pele. 
[01:22:30]  I got action.  I got the walls.  You know why?  Hang out, man.  Stinky will play you guys next break.  Every guy that has never done anything or amounted to anything has played professional foosball.  Oh, hell yeah.  24-7.  I used to drink booze and do it until my back hurt and my wrists were like half broken.  I had swollen thumbs.  That's the same thing I did.  And just booze.  Absolutely, man.  That's right.  Lose your wife.  Hey, we got to give away the Patriots tickets.  How do you want to give it away?  If anyone can name the score of the 85 Super Bowl that the Bears did them back door with 
[01:23:00]  a screen door.  They came in like this.  Hey, what are you doing?  Ah, the fridge.  Remember?  And then he pushed out of that fight with Butterhead.  Ass Butterface.  The guy with the big fat ass.  They're going to fight the two of them.  So you come up with a score of that?  That's the right score.  All right.  You come up with a score of the game.  You got tickets to the...  I think that's fair enough.  All right.  Let's say if we got a winner.  Boy, that's handed.  Or how many chicks did Tom Brady did in Ann Arbor over his four years?  That might be a good one. 
[01:23:30]  Or how many chicks Pharrell did in Ann Arbor over his six years in Bloomington?  You know, I went to a Big Ten school.  But since Bob Knight misbehaved, I tell people I went to Pitt.  You're out of your mind.  We got a bag full of bottles of booze, too, that we're taking to this event.  Bring the booze.  Bring the booze in here.  Where are they?  What's the matter with you simpletons?  All right.  Let me talk to Rick.  Rick.  Get him in here.  He's out there.  Rick.  At least get this dude a drink because he's got no food.  Get him a drink.  Hey, Rick.  You want a drink?  Do you know the answer to the question? 
[01:24:00]  I don't, but I'm going to guess.  Yeah.  All right.  You want the tickets really bad, so let's go.  You guys won't believe I just got pulled over trying to get home for you guys.  Oops.  I got a $175 ticket.  Oh, that is sweet news.  I got busted doing $104 on the 405 in L.A., and I gave the guy a cigar.  He said, I love the gig Pharrell.  Keep rocking.  Our vans was burning a fatty while we got pulled over.  He ate the entire thing.  He got sick later.  That guy's not going to kill us, is he?  No.  He's all cool, man.  That's double R.  He works with me in the morning. 
[01:24:30]  He's a pervert.  But his hat's pulled down too tight.  You all right?  He's going to eat in there.  There he goes.  All right.  He's crazy.  He's a scratch golf.  Hey, Rick, what's the score of the game?  You got to go eat it.  What's the score?  Rick.  52-34.  Wrong.  You did.  No.  All right.  Let's go to Drew.  Drew in Boston.  Drew.  Hey, what's going on?  You know the answer?  I think I do.  All right.  What's it been 20 years since the Bruins won?  I'm going to look at it.  He's looking at it.  He can't win.  I want to say.  That's not right. 
[01:25:00]  He's doing it.  You're looking it up.  You're looking it up.  You got to look it up.  I hate your family.  Joe, what's up?  Joe.  You got to look it up.  Some guy's got a Patriots yearbook in the back of his car and his trunk, a media guy.  The director of PR is Chuck Witherstein.  He's from Cambridge, and he went to Massonotten.  We've all read that crap, and then you go, what the hell am I doing?  How about the guy that lied, O'Leary?  He got a job.  I lie so much.  I think I should get everything free.  Joe.  Yo.  You know the score? 
[01:25:30]  I have no idea, but I'm going to try.  Go ahead fast.  I would say 25-27.  Yeah.  I can't believe that this is working out so swell.  It's a nice little bit.  Thanks.  Rob, what's up?  Yo, what's going on?  Hey.  What do you got?  All right.  I had an idea to get Patriots tickets, but I'll try yours.  I think it was something like 56 to 10.  That was close.  I had an idea.  56-10.  Very close.  No, that's not it either.  There's got to be at least one person from Boston that knows something about your foul  sports heritage.  Scott, what's up?  It's taken 20 years for the Bruins to win. 
[01:26:00]  The Patriots always lose in big games.  How many girls did the Patriots cripple stage diving?  How about that?  We know that answer.  Scott, what's up?  How you doing, guys?  Hey.  I got the score.  You want to fill in for me?  It was very the Bears, but we lost, and it was 46 to 10.  That's right.  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding,  ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  There it is.  Thanks, boys.  Can you go to the game?  No, I didn't know.  My dad was there, though.  No, can you go to the game?  Oh, can I?  Oh, absolutely.  All right, hold on to the line.  You got the Patriots tickets.  Cool, man.  All right, cool.  That guy, my dad was there drawing. 
[01:26:30]  Line five, Scott from Boston got the Patriot tickets.  I like the guys that instant feedback in the score like he knows something.  You're in front of a computer, dick.  You could look it up in like three seconds.  Like, I knew it was 46.10.  No, you didn't, Jared.  I like the other guy.  I don't know anything, but I think it was like 25, bro.  All right, dude.  Sure.  That's why they hang out at the Fleet Enema Center watching their little hockey team.  Nice move getting rid of Jason Allison.  That'll come back to haunt you.  I love these guys. 
[01:27:00]  Coffees.  The kings are all cool.  Stick around for a while.  We need the entertainment.  Meaning like with your little show in the morning.  Well, we're going to the game.  We got Metallica's manager going with us.  We got this guy going.  We got another guy from the Hotel California that's on the take for us.  He's always working the numbers under the levee.  He's always trying to cut off some of my incidentals.  They fill the fridge up every day with booze, and we just...  Do they?  We are cancer for that.  Do they?  Look at his eyes.  Gold toast.  Oh, we behave.  Look at this.  We're all cool.  We've only had a couple.  We're just getting started.  Here, we're going to go party with all those civilians across the street. 
[01:27:30]  Hey, it's about time, dude.  Oh, that dude was in the elevator with us.  What's happening, bro?  How do you like our language out in the elevator?  He's the kiss-ass guy.  Was it vicious?  Yeah.  Do we hate people?  Yes, you do.  Thank you very much.  That's the dude from downstairs to Brooklyn.  Does he work here?  I know that dude.  That's brown-nosed.  That's brown-nosed.  That's brown-nosed.  That's brown-nosed.  Kiss-ass.  Hey, you've got to hang out and play a round of foosball, man.  Let's go.  Let's take him on.  We're ready.  Me and Stinky.  All right.  Well, we'll take a break so you can watch this ball.  Someone's going to have to do the read because I'm getting right to it.  This is sweet.  Are you fastest ready to rock? 
[01:28:00]  Opie and Anthony.  And you actually find them rubbing the feces on the wall.  The Opie and Anthony show.  Psychotic apes.  Is this for shock factor?  Oh, my God.  N-E-W.  Victory!  Oh, yeah.  No one beats Team Anthony Stinky.  We beat Pharrell.  And his drinking buddy.  5-2.  5-2.  At foosball. 
[01:28:30]  And that's with Pharrell cheating.  You know, in one of my shots, I've got to pin the ball underneath the toe of the middle front guy.  And then I pull and slam it in the goal.  Well, the second I pin it, Pharrell starts wham, wham, and the rods back and forth on the foosball table.  And dislodges the ball from what I haven't set up.  And we still emerge victorious.  It's 5-2.  5-2 victory.  What?  No one beats Team Anthony Stinky.  Wait, wait, wait.  What happened? 
[01:29:00]  What?  You just beat Team Anthony and Opie.  I just realized that.  What happened?  I've got to tell you something, Opie.  Stinky has really gotten good.  Stinky has gotten really good in the back.  It just beat Team Anthony and Opie.  I'm sorry.  It wasn't even a thought when Pharrell wanted to play.  He'd go, come on, Stinky, let's go.  You know what?  I'm sorry.  You know, the team had to move on.  Some changes were made.  For victory, I had to have Stinky in the back.  I had to have Stinky in the back.  A younger, slimmer boy.  You know. 
[01:29:30]  You know how it is, Norton.  Well, someone had to stay here and do the WWF read.  Yeah.  At least I could say presented.  Yeah, I know.  Prevented by.  And Stinky's a Yankee fan.  Joe, what's going on?  Hello.  Hey, Joe.  Go ahead.  Hey.  I thought the score was Africa 8, Egypt 7.  No, you did the joke wrong.  If you were going to do it, it's Africa 70, Egypt 80. 
[01:30:00]  Oh, I got it backwards.  All right.  Sorry.  You got zero, you idiot.  You forgot zeros, but you could add the zero in yourself.  All right, Joe.  Thank you.  All right.  How's your sandwich, Norton?  Very good.  Thank you.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Everything's fine now.  You're okay again?  I'm very happy.  Now you can participate with the radio show, right?  Were you scared of Scott Farrell?  No.  What are you talking about?  Ben said I think he was scared.  No.  You were stunned.  You were just looking at him.  You didn't have a reaction. 
[01:30:30]  No.  I'm not scared because someone talks fast.  No.  He looks at him like he's a lunatic.  He doesn't look like a lunatic.  He's funny, though.  I like him.  But no, I wasn't scared.  All right.  Harry?  Yeah?  What's up?  Man, hey.  I'm out here in Seattle.  You guys are on delay, so you're not even on the station yet here out here in Seattle.  But I had to call, dude, because you guys have the best goddamn radio show on the radio.  Goddamn.  I crack up so much when I listen to you guys.  I'm telling every goddamn person I know. 
[01:31:00]  Harry?  You guys got to tune in at 3 o'clock Pacific time for O&A.  Harry?  Lick ass sucks.  Harry?  Yeah, go ahead.  We're on in Seattle?  Yeah.  Hey, Seattle.  Hey, hello, Seattle.  Hey, Seattle.  What's up, man?  What's up, Seattle?  For pursuit.  Hey.  Local reference, Anthony.  Very good.  Why don't you go say hi to Bill Gates?  He's right there on the lake.  Love that house on the lake.  Have a cup of Starbucks and then shoot yourself. 
[01:31:30]  Oh, wait.  That's cool.  Starbucks started in Seattle there, Jimmy.  That was great.  Yes, yes, yes.  I drove by Kurt Cobain's house last time I was in Seattle.  How about that?  How about that?  Did you go in and smack Courtney in the head?  I'm a copier technician, and I go out to Aberdeen all the time.  And I've actually passed by where, like, his...  Bragging about your thrilling lifestyle.  Can I tell you something about Aberdeen?  Yeah, go ahead.  Because I wanted to drive through where Kurt, you know, grew up. 
[01:32:00]  I'm a huge Nirvana fan.  Or he spent a bunch of his years there.  What a dump hole.  Dude, that has got to be the most...  There is no surprise that he was that depressed.  No.  I mean, everybody that grows up in that town that I know is either just crazy or they're  already dead.  I mean, because they shoot themselves.  It's the most depressing town that I've ever visited.  And when I go to, like, work on equipment, I just get the hell out of there.  You can't even sugarcoat it. 
[01:32:30]  It was so dark and depressing.  Yeah.  There was nothing.  A lot of heroin use?  It seemed like it was a town out of the 50s.  Like, time just stood still.  It probably did.  There's nothing that looks modern in the town.  No.  It's all downhill.  And the reason...  Well, for a lot of your listeners probably don't know, it used to be a big logging town.  Ah.  I mean, after all the...  Ah, logging.  After all the tree...  Hold on, Harry.  Used to.  That's all I saw in Aberdeen.  They have, what, a river there or something?  It was just packed with logs.  Yeah.  Well, that's all it is. 
[01:33:00]  The Puget Sound, you know, I mean, it comes...  The Pacific Ocean comes in there and they got a lot of...  Pacific Ocean, local reference.  Sir, is that anywhere near...  That covers San Francisco, too.  Is that anywhere near...  Dude, is that anywhere near Tacoma Airport?  Oh, oh, oh.  SeaTac.  No, no, no.  SeaTac, Jim.  SeaTac.  SeaTac is a town of itself that's in between Seattle and Tacoma.  That's right, Seattle and Tacoma.  That's why they call it SeaTac.  SeaTac.  But Tacoma Dome, that's a whole other story.  That's the worst damn place in the world.  They need to just... 
[01:33:30]  Hey, Harry.  It's a whole other ball of wax, Harry.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're really boring us at this point.  Yeah, this is enough Seattle talk.  Let's talk about ass.  Let's move on with the radio show.  Yeah.  All right, man.  Thank you, Harry.  Thank you, Harry.  How's it going?  All right.  Here goes Harry.  I learned something today.  From Seattle.  We're on in Seattle.  Yeah, who knew?  When they had that one.  I don't know.  Jennifer, what's going on?  Hi.  Hi.  Hello.  Can you hear me?  Yes, we can hear you, Jennifer.  Okay, so I had you guys on speakerphone.  I just waited a really long time. 
[01:34:00]  Yes, yes, yes.  Okay, what's up?  So?  So what do you got, Jennifer?  I have lots of questions.  Yeah.  All right.  Okay.  I have a question about your contest.  Ah, contest.  Who's screaming in the background?  Uh, my kids.  You got kids?  I'm a mommy.  That can be hot.  How old are you?  28.  How many kids?  Two.  Two.  All right.  You want in on the Naughty Nighty contest?  Yes, I do.  All right. 
[01:34:30]  What's the question?  All right.  Could you speed things up here, please?  Yes.  Okay.  Okay.  Well, are exotic outfits okay?  Or do you want, like, Frederick the Hollywood stuff?  It's Naughty Nighty.  Naughty Nighty.  What are you grading on?  Whatever you want to do.  Whatever I want to do?  Yeah.  What are you grading on?  Oh, Jess.  It's not grading.  It's judged by listeners.  They go to the website, and they will check out the pictures, and they will vote.  They will check out you and your Naughty Nighty.  Okay.  It's not that complicated. 
[01:35:00]  By the way, contest has begun today.  Right.  I heard you.  Where are you guys at?  As a matter of fact, a girl is on her way down to kick off the whole contest today.  Ladies, if you can't make it down today, tomorrow, between 3 and 7.  Between 3 and 7.  Just show up with your Naughty Nighty.  Okay.  In the boob-a-lantern thing?  That's pretty cool.  Yeah.  All right.  Jennifer, thank you.  Yeah.  Are you in Philly?  No.  I'm in Jersey.  Jersey.  Well, come on by the station then tomorrow if you'd like.  More questions, perhaps. 
[01:35:30]  What?  I said I had more questions.  Like what?  Well, sorry.  What's your next question?  Oh, never mind.  Oh, go ahead.  Don't be shy.  Never mind.  Go ahead.  Oh, we insulted her now.  That's all right.  Never mind.  Jennifer's tend to be a little touchy, Opie.  Where the problem?  Jennifer, where the problem?  They tend to be a little touchy, Jennifer's.  Did we insult her?  Is she going to ask for our money?  What are you being graded on?  Okay.  Show some good, show some skin, a good mix of skin and lingerie. 
[01:36:00]  You're being graded on originality.  Exactly.  No, originality and how close it comes to showing you.  See?  Thank you, Jim.  That was cute.  I have a foosball table and we'll kick your asses.  No, you won't, Eric.  Joe, what's up?  You won't.  Hey.  Hey.  How you doing?  All right.  I tried to get you while you were talking about foosball.  Anthony, I was just talking to Stinky.  If you play back, you ever do a Goldie shot?  No.  The air shot.  The air shot.  You get the ball actually rolls up on the goalie's foot between his foot and the back 
[01:36:30]  board right over the goal and you can flip it over all the men into the goal.  Very tricky shot.  You're a player then.  You're a player.  Very tricky shot.  Yeah, it is.  You got a tournament table you use or a hurricane?  Which one are we using now?  It's not the one with the three goalies.  One goalie.  One goalie.  One goalie and the two men.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's probably, well, there's other makes, but tournament tables are the only 
[01:37:00]  ones that I was able to do the aerial goalie shot on.  Yeah, you can't do the other ones.  That's a cool shot if you can do that.  Yeah, great shot.  Yeah.  All right, Joe.  Thank you.  All right, man.  Bye.  Is that a legal shot or will you get thrown out of the foosball tournament for that?  I think a real tournament you might get thrown out.  I'm not sure.  Or, you know, it might just be one of those, hey, if it goes in, it goes in.  Well, I'm sure a hard call foosball player has his rules.  Yes.  Certain codes.  I don't like the five man shot.  And by the way, that was one of the shots that Pharrell got in. 
[01:37:30]  Yeah.  It was off the five man.  Five man should be strictly for passing and blocking, things like that.  You shouldn't do the five man cheap shot.  I didn't even know he was playing foosball.  It's not skillful.  Yeah, I know.  You should never even think about it when you're playing foosball.  Get it up, Rod.  Get it out of our zone.  It's in our zone the whole time.  It's in our zone.  We can't wait.  It's in our zone.  Kevin, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Hey, I just wanted to call.  I was in the supermarket last night.  I think Norton looks like that boy in the Globe newspaper there that you get at the checkout. 
[01:38:00]  Oh, bad boy.  That's good.  Bad boy from the Globe newspaper.  It's Norton.  I know the picture you're talking about.  You know which one?  Jim Norton and Bad Boy.  Put some fangs on him, and he's a funny bastard, but boy, he's no good-looking guy.  All right.  Thank you, Mr. Pelley.  You guys suck.  All right, Kevin.  I am like a four, man.  We're going to replay the Buddy Epson stuff in just a minute here.  I've got to hear some of those clips.  But first, Stalker Patty.  Stalker Patty.  Hey, how are you?  How are you?  Hey. 
[01:38:30]  Everyone has their catchphrases they've got to get in.  Yeah, how are you?  She's ripping off Lady Drunk, though.  What the how are you?  Well, anyway, they just put me on hold in case they wanted to talk to me or something.  Um, where are you?  Well, right now, I'm upstairs.  I just said hi to Virginia.  Hey, city, hi to Virginia.  Was it once talking with Ronald?  Oh, God, she sounds like a witch.  Oh, I'm not a witch.  Are we doing Stalker Patty Cribs tomorrow? 
[01:39:00]  Yep.  Cribs tomorrow.  You set it up with Rick and Steve.  They're going to film the whole thing as you show them where you live?  Yep.  What is the most exciting thing they're going to get to see tomorrow?  Well, I don't know.  I'm not sure.  Maybe my, uh...  Well, I know Jim would love my Ozzy Osbourne collection.  What do you got?  What do you got?  What do you got?  I got all kinds of articles.  I'm going back like 25 years.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  We finally found something you do well.  Yeah.  I also have a Beatle collection. 
[01:39:30]  It's almost my whole life.  Real Beatles or the insect or the music?  No, no.  Well, articles and stuff going back to the 60s even.  Thrilled.  Xerox copies of the LPs.  Oh, I do.  I have all those, too.  How's your hair growing in that, Patty?  Very well.  In fact, if it gets another inch longer, what I would like to do is put a little highlighter  into it or make it a little bit lighter.  Highlight.  Yeah.  I'll have Allison do it because she's good at that. 
[01:40:00]  You know what's a nice highlight for your hair?  If you take a shotgun, a little brain light.  Oh, very funny, Jim.  Very funny, Jim.  Very funny.  Like the rib circling.  Real funny.  All right, Patty, tomorrow?  Yep.  Start with Patty Cribs.  Okay.  All right.  Hold on a line.  All right.  Why?  She's right upstairs.  Make her come down and take a picture of her with those ant glasses on that someone  sent us.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, you know what?  We've got to do that.  Yeah.  The ant glasses.  Someone sent us these glasses. 
[01:40:30]  They have antennas on them and compound eyes, and you look like a big ant wearing them.  She'll look perfect.  Hubbla hubbla, Jim.  We had some fun in the office with those yesterday.  Yes, we did.  You're an ant.  Uh-huh.  You, too.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, we get a lot of feedback about Buddy Epson.  And then, uh, people, people missed it because they were still working.  So, uh, we, I, we just want to play the three songs, really.  Mm-hmm.  And then, uh, his brand new Well Doggy 2002, right?  Yeah.  Opie equals Pete Best. 
[01:41:00]  Stinky equals Ringo Starr.  Ah.  You see what I had to do, though?  Stinky is practicing every day.  Uh, he's, he's playing foosball, and he's gotten very good.  He plays a very good goalie.  You want to call, you want to call back?  This will be the best call back of the day.  All right.  West Coast Dave from San Francisco writes, I bet Moose Moran is listening to you guys right  now in Seattle.  Moose Moran.  The Moose.  Didn't we have him on the phone?  Yeah.  Yeah, we had Moose Moran. 
[01:41:30]  Over the, um.  He was playing what song over and over again, and for what reason?  I believe the crisis was the American plane that was in China.  Oh, wow.  Okay.  And being held hostage.  And he said until the people had returned, he was going to play Tie a Yellow Ribbon.  Wasn't that the song?  Yeah, over and over.  Over and over and over again.  He was going to stay on the air until they got released, and all he was going to do was  play that song over and over again.  And he was hoping that the crisis would last longer than it did, because I think it was  resolved pretty quickly. 
[01:42:00]  And Moose got some newspaper on that one.  So he called up the Moose.  The Moose.  Well, I tell you, sometimes an activist will get involved, and boy, you just can't help  but take action.  Oh, that's right.  We all have our civic duty.  Yeah.  I'll make this about me.  That's pretty much what he does.  Of course.  That's what it is.  Hey, all right.  So we had Buddy Epsit on just a little while ago, really.  And you want to hear the Angelica song first?  The Angelica song.  We've got such great Buddy clips.  Put out one more.  Here. 
[01:42:30]  Which one do you want?  Angelica.  You want Angelica?  Oh, there it is.  Up there.  All right.  Christian's declaring, he says, Ann declares, no one beats Stinky in the rear.  Well, you put it that funny way.  I think he plays a good goalie in foosball.  Maybe I shouldn't say he's good in the rear.  Sorry, Christian.  Just Stinky so good back there.  From Tulsa.  How about that?  Syndication underground.  In Oklahoma.  Tulsa.  Tulsa, Oklahoma, I think. 
[01:43:00]  Tulsa, Alabama.  No, Tulsa, Oklahoma.  Tulsa.  All right.  Here's Buddy Epsit.  He is our pal.  We didn't mess with him.  We love Buddy.  Here he is singing a song called Angelica.  Who put the jam on the pussycat's tail?  Who put the grease on the banister rail?  Who put cement in the scrubbing up pail?  Who?  Angelica.  Who broke the milk bottle out on the drive? 
[01:43:30]  Who squeezed the goldfish until they aren't alive?  Who spilled her mommy's Chanel number five?  Who?  Angelica.  I don't know about you, but this kid Angelica really needs a fist in her stomach.  She's not a good girl.  Don from East Meadow says it all.  My windows and speakers just exploded when he hit that Angelica note. 
[01:44:00]  Oh, sounds like a TIE fighter.  Ben, what are you oh-godding about?  Patty.  Patty?  Angelica.  Yeah, bring her in.  Did you get a picture of this?  Angelica.  Here's stalker Patty.  She just called from...  Hey!  Upstairs.  Hey.  How are you?  Hey.  Oh, God.  Look at her.  Put your ant glasses on.  Let me see you with your ant glasses.  Oh, God.  She looks so much like an ant. 
[01:44:30]  You look like a real ant.  You ever see Boys Don't Cry with that haircut?  Yeah.  Boys Don't Cry.  This is Patty Swank.  No, it's not.  Maybe Patty Skank.  I just saw myself in the mirror.  I laughed at myself.  Yeah.  You're starting to look like the boy wonder.  Well, when the hair grows longer, I won't laugh.  Anyone working on a Patty sculpture and you're working on the mouth, chew up a bunch of Hubba Bubba, right? 
[01:45:00]  And then mold it in the shape of gums and then stick some of those tiny little white chiclets in there.  What's a Hubba Bubba?  It's bubble gum.  Hey, Patty, thanks for stopping by.  We'll see you tomorrow for stalker Patty Cribs.  Okay.  All right.  I like these ant glasses.  Get the...  Awesome.  All right.  They're reesome.  Can we play Snowshoe Tom?  Sure.  You said, oh, you know.  Buddy Epson, a little while ago.  He sang a lot of songs for us today before he...  Yes, he did.  His Well Doggy for 2002.  Here's Snowshoe Tom. 
[01:45:30]  Snowshoe Tom used to carry the mail through wind and thunder, snow and hail.  He had no dogs and he had no sled, but one thought drove him straight ahead.  Go, man, go.  Got to get on through the snow.  Mush, man, mush.  Got to get on through the snush.  Go, man, go.  Go means mush and Eskimo.  So, go, man, go, man, go, man, go.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There's a lot of time and the birds is walking on the ground. 
[01:46:00]  And the snow is rifted, treetopped all, and nobody getting through at all.  Oh, go, man, go.  It goes on like that.  Oh, yeah.  It goes on like that.  Nice one, buddy.  Go, man, go.  Blow, blow, man, blow means coca-nigoro.  Go, what?  Go, Eskimo.  What the hell?  It sounds like his voice box is saying, die already.  I can't even function anymore.  I think he sounds great for 95 or 93 or... 
[01:46:30]  They're coming to America today.  And finally, Buddy Epson singing the Well Doggy song.  I didn't know he had it in.  Oh, that's great.  Oh, yeah.  Well Doggy.  Well Doggy.  Well Doggy.  Well Doggy.  Yeah, Doggy.  Yeah, Doggy.  Oh, Connor.  Yeah, Doggy.  Give it to me.  Yeah, Doggy.  Oh, Doggy.  Oh, Doggy.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:47:00]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I knew that would work.  That's funny.  That certainly doesn't sound like the way he just did it.  Well, I think he has an accompaniment there.  I got to hear that again.  I am so proud of myself.  Do that again.  I knew it was going to work.  Do that again.  I got to hear that.  It's all in the timing.  Oh, yeah.  Well Doggy.  Well Doggy.  Well Doggy.  Well Doggy.  Yeah, Doggy. 
[01:47:30]  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, Doggy.  Yeah, Doggy.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, Doggy.  Oh, Doggy.  Oh, Doggy.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  That's funny.  Getting it on.  Goddamn.  Is that funny?  Make that into a sweeper.  Immediately.  Oh, Doggy.  Oh, Doggy.  Oh, Doggy. 
[01:48:00]  Turn off the show.  Oh, it's not going to get any funnier than that.  Oh, Doggy.  Sorry.  Go listen to a pop song.  Oh, Doggy.  Oh, Doggy.  Well, Doggy.  Ah, ah.  Well, Doggy.  Yeah, oh, Doggy.  Ah, ah.  All right, we can do a little fat boy mix here.  Hold on.  I might need my other.  We're going to have to turn this thing around.  All right.  Here we go.  Oh, yeah.  Well, Doggy.  Well, Doggy.  Well, Doggy.

[01:49:00]  That's why this show works.  You can't prepare for that.  It's just got to happen.  It's hilarious.  I swear to God, I can hear that another ten times in a row.  We've got to get all the buddy clips, because someone's saying it would be fun to have him go,  I'm sorry, at the end.  Put together a buddy sex clip.  I don't know how to, yeah, we'll work on it. 
[01:49:30]  Yeah, we'll have to actually go into the studio and do it.  All right, you'll never hear it.  You mean a production room?  A production studio with all the big, pretty knobs?  Someone said they just crapped themselves.  That's funny, man.  You've got to put that up on the site.  This is Sean from Hakesville.  Hey, doggies.  Hey, doggies.  Now someone is saying they had the porno music.  Oh, God, yeah. 
[01:50:00]  All right.  Okay.  I've got to hear that.  Oh, the music.  Hell yeah.  Usually radio guys do this behind the scene.  They're like, all right, that's good.  All right, now let's add music.  Wait, we need a little something here.  We try it out on the air.  What the hell?  First track, always the best porno track.  Okay.  All right, hold on.  I need this.  I need this over here.  I need you over here.  There we go.  All right, here we go.  Good afternoon.  That's the Tourette's Warhouse from the Phantom World CD.

[01:51:00]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Well, doggie.  That's not bad.  All right.  This is fun, man.  All right.  Wait, now Andrew wants us to add another one.  What?  Production element, as it's called in the biz.  Andrew, what's up?  Hey, guys.  At the end, you have to have him say,  Crumpet Muncher. 
[01:51:30]  Hey, Garrett ruled.  Yes, he does.  Garrett ruled.  Garrett.  Young Garrett.  Certainly does.  All right.  I think you get the point.  You really want to do it again?  I think they get the point.  Oh, God.  All right.  I think we'll take a break.  One more.  It's a new year.  We're trying not to, you know, pound bits into the ground as much.  Too late.  As much.  I said as much. 
[01:52:00]  God, if this was 2001, we'd do it for another 20 minutes.  It makes us laugh.  I don't care.  Sorry.  Scott, what's going on?  What's up, boys?  Hey.  Stick a fork in me.  I am all done.  That is hilarious, man.  It really is.  I was just off the road, man.  Buddy getting his F on.  That is some funny ass going on there, man.  All right, Scott.  Thank you.  You guys made my day, man.  You guys suck.  All right, thanks.  We'll doggie.

All right, so we'll, yeah, what, and then we'll do a little this and a little that, and  then, you know, the show.  Exactly.  Do whatever you want as we do this.  Sure.  The Opie and Anthony F. U. Line is there for you when life sucks.  Sucks to be me.  Call any time, 212-830-3785. 
[01:53:00]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  And E.W.  Yeah, we're back to the O&A Show.  I hope someone out there is noticing shorter commercial breaks.  More gooder.  More gooder in the new year.  We worked very hard to do this, so I hope you're noticing.  God, I hope you're noticing.  Please.  Look at Josh from D.C. saying, that bit was even funny down here in D.C. 
[01:53:30]  Oh, wow.  That's great.  That was funny.  Something about Buddy, you're getting his F on, just disturbingly funny.  We're going to add two more clips, by the way.  Oh, good.  Mike is suggesting we start the bit with Use It or Lose It from Buddy.  You got that, right?  Use It or Lose It.  So that'll start the bit.  Yeah.  And then when the bit's over, do you have that clip or do I have it?  Which one? 
[01:54:00]  I got that one.  You got it?  And then at the end, we'll end the bit with this.  Is that supposed to be sexy?  It's a good mix of this song.  I love this song. 
[01:54:30]  I'm getting lost.  Sorry.  Oh, my God.  It's right.  Hey, throw out the first Naughty Nighty.  Yes.  Nice.  What a surprise.  Someone said they were coming down and they came down.  I know.  That never happens.  That never happens, right?  Because it looks like we're going to have another problem with our virgin thing tomorrow.  Virgin.  Why?  What now?  Maybe we can get her on the line.  That Keisha, that hot African princess.  Yeah.  That's what, 21, I think she said? 
[01:55:00]  With the junk in the trunk.  I'm a virgin and I got junk in the trunk.  And I like when a guy come, I could call the girl daddy.  She said she's getting out of work at, what, 4?  Yeah, she doesn't get out of work until 4 o'clock.  So now we might reschedule her when we're down in Philly.  Yeah, next Friday.  Might as well.  Yeah, okay.  So.  Hmm.  Yeah, but, excuse me.  That's how it all begins.  Didn't she want to have sex in the Empire State Building?  Yeah.  How are we going to do that in Philly? 
[01:55:30]  Oof.  Maybe she could have sex on those stairs that Rocky ran up.  Yeah.  Or what if we just get some wood and make a frame of the Empire State Building?  Yeah.  Look at me making believe I know all about Philly.  Man, not doing a good job of it.  How about in front of the Liberty Bell?  Oh.  Yeah.  Local reference.  It's got a crack in it.  Somebody drop the darn thing?  Ha ha ha. 
[01:56:00]  Ha ha, you card.  And Keisha's got a crack, too.  Keisha.  Yeah.  I've been a virgin.  She had that sound.  That talk.  Well, she doesn't get out of work until 4 in Philly.  By the time we get her up here, it'll be 5.36.  You know, don't have enough time to play with there.  Will the girl be in here soon?  Not that I'm trying to force you.  Oh, that girl?  Oh.  Yeah.  I'm only here until 6.30, so I'd like to see her.  Naughty night.  Where are you going? 
[01:56:30]  He's got some gig.  I don't remember.  Is it a gig?  I wasn't even going to.  I was not even going to be a whore.  Are you sick?  No.  Or is it sold out?  That means ticket sales are fine.  Yeah.  No, I have.  There are actually tickets available for tonight.  And I think late show tomorrow, but Stress Factory.  I have time tomorrow.  Oh, right.  But I have to beat traffic.  Yeah.  All right.  Can't even answer to Holland.  Well, we'll bring her in.  Yeah, let's get the girl for the Naughty Nighty contest.  Thank you, pals.  Contest is on, by the way.  Contest on.  Contest on.  Game on.  And we're doing baby steps with this contest because it's going to get very complicated 
[01:57:00]  because we'll be broadcasting in Philly and possibly Washington, D.C. in the very near future.  Uh-huh.  So you're going to have an opportunity to see us in Philly and Washington with your Naughty  Nighties.  But let's just start with this.  Contest is on.  You can come down today.  We have an hour, hour and a half left in the show.  Uh-huh.  Or tomorrow between three and seven, ladies, if you're close to the radio station, come  down between three and seven with your Naughty Nighty and we'll take your pictures for the  website and then the guys will vote on their favorite Naughty Nighty. 
[01:57:30]  Right-o.  Okay?  Okay.  Oh, that's the greatest.  Right-o.  Be careful.  We don't want to do a show for our amusement.  We learn so much from Washington.  We have a different brand of humor and we do a radio show for our own amusement.  I like their structure.  And we don't have structure.  Nothing.  They're really brilliant.  Who cares?  All right.  What's your name again?  D.  D.  D.  Ooh.  Rod. 
[01:58:00]  Hi.  Hi, D.  D called us about an hour and a half ago, right?  I did.  Nice.  Mm-hmm.  Very nice.  Yeah.  You have a naughty...  I come up on like all these virgins.  Hey, why don't you talk in the mic there?  There you go.  I show up on like all the virgins that call up and don't show up, so...  Yeah, you showed up.  That's nice.  Where's your naughty nighty?  Well, half of it's underneath.  Ah.  The other half I'm going to change into in the studio.  Oh, right here in the studio.  Oh, in the studio.  Wow.  We didn't even have to try.  There's a treat.  Good guest.  We didn't even have to...  I thought it was going to be a hassle. 
[01:58:30]  We didn't even have to feed her booze and alcohol.  Booze and drugs.  Booze and alcohol.  I know, I know, I know.  I'm a little slow today.  All right.  And she's a very lovely girl.  Look at that.  She's got dark features with the white skin.  Something tells me she can fill out a naughty nighty very well.  She's a teen.  What's that?  You're a teen?  You're a teen?  My teen.  Teen naughty nighty.  Teen naughty nighty.  I have to come down because I turned 20 in September, so I have like six more months of my glory days. 
[01:59:00]  Yeah, we lost a lot of teens in the last year.  Yeah, something that happens with the 19-year-olds.  One year goes by and somehow they're not teens anymore.  Kind of like the Sam Adams.  We've got to keep a stock of teens.  We've got to keep new teens coming.  Hey, look at that.  There you go.  What are you wearing there?  It's like a black thong number or is that a...  No.  A little G-string going on.  A little G-string thing.  G-string thing.  Going on.  There you go.  Smells very good, too.  That's a very good perfume.  That's a good sign.  That's a good perfume.  That's a good sign.  What is it? 
[01:59:30]  Good perfume.  He liked it.  Yes.  He smelled me.  I prefer the old chloroform.  It would have been funny, probably, if I shouldn't say chloroform.  Chloroform.  Chloroform.  Chloroform.  I suck.  My one moment today where I have something funny to say and I blow it.  Good job.  Chloroform.  Chloroform.  We're going to be seeing that on Instant Feedback at about 6.45.  Okay, so you can get the preview before I put on my ass.  Can you stand up? 
[02:00:00]  What, do you want to put on my ass?  Yeah.  I wasn't going to question.  Turn around and forget it.  Oh, you like that, right?  Those are good cheeks for spanking.  You would just wail that.  You want to?  Yeah.  Give a little spanking there, Norton.  Be gentle.  Don't raise any welts.  I'm not going to come back.  All right, relax.  Don't raise any welts.  That'll jiggle a little bit.  You wanted a...  There you go.  Did she sit in a gravel driveway before she got here?  Go.  Hey, look at that.  All right.  Harder?  No, I don't.  Oh, yeah.  Nice. 
[02:00:30]  Does that do anything for you?  No.  Not a thing.  You don't like the spanking or anything like that?  No, I'm not really into that.  I didn't do it too hard, right?  No, he's good.  You're into the yellow discipline?  Like Norton is?  No, huh?  Yeah.  Not like that girl that called up.  No.  I was sitting there while he was in the Jamaica train station.  It was kind of funny.  I was thinking...  Yeah, my future wife calling up before.  All right.  She's getting naked.  There we go.  Didn't even have to ask.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  There you go.  Nice.  Very nice.  Right?  That is... 
[02:01:00]  What size?  What size?  36.  Might be a little higher.  I was trying to be nice.  36?  Keep on going.  38C?  No.  Let me guess.  I'm usually pretty good, right?  What happened?  38D.  What?  In my dreams, I wish I was in WD.  All right.  36C.  That is not a D.  I would have bet a lot of money that's not D.  No, it's not D.  It's full C.  36C.  36C.  What did I say?  You said 38C.  Oh, then I went 38 at the last second.  Yes, I think. 
[02:01:30]  C?  I went from D to C, so we all kind of, you know...  Sorry.  A little full paw.  Here's another preview before it goes on.  Oh, there it is.  Nice.  All right.  Oh, my gosh.  We didn't have to do anything.  And we're getting a Whip-Em-Out Thursday.  Look at that Whip-Em-Out.  Oh, yeah.  Whip-Em-Out whenever.  That's it.  It is Whip-Em-Out whenever.  Very nice.  Teen boobs.  Teen boobage.  By the way, speaking of which, Ann, really fast as she puts on her Naughty Nighty, thank  you to Adam Farrar, our pal.  Uh-huh.  He didn't even tell us he was doing this when he was promoting the job all day on the show 
[02:02:00]  yesterday.  Wow sticker.  Yeah.  Opening scene.  On the job.  On the job.  With Dennis Leary.  Thank you.  Took a Wow sticker and put it right by his desk.  Hey.  So.  Didn't even have a Whip-Em-Out.  Hey, there you go.  You know what?  She's got to, like, lounge around the Ikea furniture.  The new furniture.  Can't you tell it's freezing in the studio?  You can definitely tell.  We knew you were coming.  Norton.  Norton gets me again.  Jimmy.  He turns around and points at his lap and goes, look, look.  No one cares. 
[02:02:30]  He's so excited with showing people how excited he is.  That's all it takes?  Nothing against our fine team, but that's all it takes.  He smacked her ass.  He had some contact.  No, it was before that.  Look at his hands in his pocket and he is squeezing.  He's going, all right.  Isn't he amazing?  I don't have a full rod.  I got, like, six going.  I'm doing good.  Well, why don't you follow Rick the photographer.  Yeah, Rick will put you on the Ikea couches. 
[02:03:00]  Yeah.  You can work the whole room.  What's going on in the Ikea couches?  No, those are brand new.  Those couches are virgin.  Those are virgin.  Virgin couches.  Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.  You're the worst.  Norton, Connor.  You're the worst.  You're so bad.  All right.  That rocked.  Yeah.  Contest is on.  We got our first.  Off to a fine start.  Hopefully more ladies will show up tomorrow.  Good start.  Don't you love a person that means what they say and says what they mean? 
[02:03:30]  Shows right up and takes the clothing off.  That's great.  What?  Who went?  No, comes right down and says, I'll take my clothes off and does.  That's great.  Don't you have to be at the stress factory?  Not for a while.  I have to leave here in a little over 40 minutes, but thank you for plugging.  Well, let me go to Ed.  Ed, you're next on the Opie and Anthony show.  What's up?  Hey, guys.  I just want to ask you, is she a finalist?  She is.  She's a finalist.  She is definitely a finalist.  Oh, a finalist.  Definitely. 
[02:04:00]  Definitely a finalist.  I'm going to tell her personally.  Thanks, guys.  I'm out.  All right, Ed.  Harry from D.C. is saying, Norton's chloroform in his pants.  Chloroform.  You stink.  Chloroform.  I prefer chloroform.  Hey, do we have another unlucky lottery winner today?  Ladies and germs.  Sometimes I say that, you know, just to get a crowd laughing.  He's, you know, quick.  He meant to say gentlemen, didn't he? 
[02:04:30]  But he said germs.  Ladies and germs.  Unlucky lottery?  I think we might.  Was there one today?  I know we got a, there's the bitches that'll get you's.  You want to do the bitches that'll get you's?  Yeah.  We got a bitches that'll get you's.  All right.  Rick's going to get the bitches that'll get you's music.  We also have unlucky lottery.  Man has wrong side of head operated on.  Yeah.  Now, Rick.  Do you have news clips of that, Rick?  Yeah.  Rick, I don't consider that an unlucky lottery.  Why not?  Because it happens a lot. 
[02:05:00]  Yeah.  The odds aren't all that bad on that happening to you.  I don't know about that.  It doesn't seem like an unlucky lottery.  No, if we start going into things like the wrong side of your head was operated on.  That's unlucky.  It's unlucky, but what do you call it?  Lucky?  It's not like that fate thing with the odds and like a boulder toppling off a cliff after  a million years sitting there on your car.  That's human error.  Yeah.  Some human error could be.  You don't think this is unlucky lottery?  A surgeon at Rhode Island Hospital operated on the wrong side of a man's head after a 
[02:05:30]  CAT scan was placed backwards.  It's unlucky on an x-ray viewing box, but I don't see it as being part of the unlucky  lottery.  Let me read on, Anthony.  A moose crossing in front of your snowmobile.  That's an unlucky lottery.  Two cuts into your brain.  That's where you are.  Aim good?  You're on your jet ski and a duck flies into your skull and kills you at 60 miles an hour.  That's an unlucky lottery.  There's a lot of moose in, though, huh? 
[02:06:00]  Moose in some areas that should do the snowmobiling.  Yeah.  What about all those people in Maine?  Well, okay.  They could hit a moose.  For some reason, I can't put my finger on it, but I don't believe this qualifies as an  unlucky lottery.  Well, there's a line here, if I might interject.  It says, wrong side surgery tops the list of 27 serious preventable events prepared by  the National Quality Formula.  Wow.  Meaning it happens not all the time, but with more frequency than certain things.  I hate to.  You know what?  I might have to agree with Ann, because the next line says, Dr. Kenneth Kaser, the group's 
[02:06:30]  president, said surgery, this type of surgery occurs more frequently than a lot of people  would like to believe.  See?  And there's just something about it that doesn't seem unlucky lottery-like.  The patient had bleeding on the right side of his brain, but the reverse scan made it  look like as if the bleeding was on the left, according to the hospital's report filed  Tuesday.  In addition, the patient's incision site had not been marked with a pen as recommended  by error prevention experts.  After the surgeon drilled two holes in the left side of the patient's skull and found 
[02:07:00]  no bleeding, the procedure was repeated on the right side and the blood was drained.  The patient has suffered no ill effects from the December 12th era.  So you're not saying this is an unlucky lottery?  No.  Okay.  I'll give you something that would make a story similar to this unlucky lottery.  If a tumor in your head, instead of the doctor operating on the wrong side, moved to the  other side of your head, and then he cut open and it's gone, I'd be like, well, what  are the odds of that happening?  It's got to be a little weirder than this. 
[02:07:30]  How about a new segment for the Opie and Anthony show?  Yeah.  The It Sucks to Be You segment.  Oh, we need more segments.  That's more a It Sucks to Be You.  It Sucks to Be You.  No, say he got the right side of his head operated on and he was walking home and a stray bullet  pierced the other side of his head.  Ah, unlucky lottery.  Right.  Okay.  But this, It Sucks to Be You.  Yeah.  This sucks to be you.  You lose.  Yeah.  It's like that goddamn Alanis Morissette ironic song. 
[02:08:00]  That isn't ironic.  Not at all.  Those things aren't ironic.  No.  They're unfortunate.  Yeah.  They're sad in some cases, but...  And they're sucky when put in a song.  Right.  Yeah.  So that's the first...  Isn't this then this first story in the It Sucks to Be You?  Yes.  Wow.  This guy's got some deal going on with his wife in Boston.  Greg, what's up?  Hey, man.  Is this the truth?  It's the truth.  All right.  Say what you got to say.  Okay.  Here's the deal.  She's on the Wow Me Picks.  She's a WBCN girl. 
[02:08:30]  Onei marked up.  All right.  Let me just explain really fast.  We have an underground website, foundrymusic.com, F-O-U-N-D-R-Y music.com.  The link is on opianthony.com.  There's a Wow Me section, which is great because girls from all over the country at this point  are sending in pictures of themselves topless.  Wow pictures.  Continue.  Have you seen her?  I didn't see the new one.  No.  She must be the latest one.  She hit yesterday.  It's unbelievable.  Great time last night.  So, if she gets 10,000 clicks, then I get a three-way. 
[02:09:00]  Oh, really?  Yep.  If 10,000 people check out your wife's boobies, you get the threesome?  You got it.  Hoping for the best, man.  That's some arrangement you got there.  We are working on it.  All right.  I think your little announcement is going to put it over the top, my friend.  Let us know how it is, okay?  Sure will.  And I hope you guys suck and we enjoy it.  All right.  Thanks, Greg.  Great.  Is it in the Wow Me section?  Yeah.  All right. 
[02:09:30]  Let's click here to see Wow Me picks.  Mm-hmm.  I think I'm navigating Foundry.  What are you doing?  Nothing.  He's picking his helmet, I think.  And what's this girl?  What is the girl's name?  BCN.  Okay.  Let me see.  BCN girl or Boston girl.  Take a quick gander here.  All right.  It's popping up.  Let me see.  Let me see.  Let me see.  Let me see.  Let me see.  Oh, wow.  Look at that.  Ah. 
[02:10:00]  When was this taken?  I guess very recently.  Nice.  Those are riveted on.  That's a definition of riveted on.  Those are the rivets?  Yeah.  I was thinking more of Hershey Kisses.  Look.  Let me see.  That's riveted on, not welded on nippies.  Oh, wow.  You're right.  See?  That's the difference.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  How many hits does he need?  Uh, 10,000.  How many hits is he up to?  Good luck.  Uh, I can't tell. 
[02:10:30]  Oh, oh.  I can't tell.  Oh, access 3,170 times.  And, uh, she just got a picture up there.  So, yeah.  Nice.  She's got a shot.  She's got a shot.  Goes to 10,000, huh?  Oh, yeah.  Some of these girls got 20,000.  Ah, she picked a bad deal.  Hey, how you doing?  Huh?  I got, I got, I hit like almost 20,000 on there.  I got three up.  You did?  I got three up on there.  You do?  You got three wow me shots up there?  Yeah.  Well, who are you?  What a tool.  What a tool?  What a tool.  All right, there you go. 
[02:11:00]  Girl's a trooper.  She got 17,000, 21 accesses on one of these.  She got 21,000 on another.  Oh, yeah.  I like to wow.  Here they are.  And she's now in the Naughty Nighty contest.  You liked your pictures?  Yeah.  They were a little uncomfortable, some of them, but.  Rick.  What did you do, Rick?  No, no, no, no, no.  What did you do?  I didn't do anything bad.  We've seen past.  I'm serious.  We've seen past shots that you have taken.  It's the worst shots.  He makes the girl so uncomfortable. 
[02:11:30]  Exactly.  But they're supposed to.  They're not like.  They're not.  They're not pros.  They're not like.  Well, I got to position them because the way they normally lie doesn't show enough skin.  So I have to twist them and turn them just the right way.  Skin.  Skin.  So what was uncomfortable?  The knee in the middle of her back?  No, she liked that.  Yeah.  Next time, use some chloroform.  Ladies and germs. 
[02:12:00]  Hygian flew in and boy are my arms tired.  Huddle, huddle.  Why is Joe Pesci breaking in?  It's the bitches that'll get you.  This is one of our new segments.  It's the bitches that'll get you.  For our new format that's going to sweep the nation.  It's the bitches that'll get you.  The bitches that'll get you.  Remember, we had the sucks to be you segment today.  Sucks to be you.  We don't have any kind of song or anything.  Very similar to the unlucky lottery.  Yeah. 
[02:12:30]  Only not quite as odd and strange.  Just bad.  Here it is.  The bitches that'll get you.  The bitches that'll get you.  His lotto winner must share loot with ex.  It's a bitches that'll get you.  Don't even think I mean ex-wife.  Ex-girlfriend.  Ex-girlfriend.  Ex-daddy, get you.  A Brooklyn woman has a lotto to be happy about today.  Ha, ha, ha.  There's even a little joke in there.  Kill yourself.  A lotto to be happy about. 
[02:13:00]  A jury ordered...  Find me a jury.  It's a bitch.  A jury ordered her ex-boyfriend  to give her $3.2 million.  From the jackpot.  Ivy Mae Johnson, 51.  And Dermon Spence, 50.  Bought the winning ticket on July 23rd, 1999.  At a Brooklyn convenience store.  Spence didn't tell her when it won.  Paying $7.5 million.  I love that.  That's right.  It's mine.  He's just walking around with really nice clothes. 
[02:13:30]  Ha, ha.  And eating the prime rib.  While she's eating steakums.  Steakums.  Why I gotta have the mac and cheese.  That rocks.  Driving around in a Rolls Royce.  She's taking the bus to work.  What?  What's wrong?  Why I gotta have the mac and cheese.  That's even funnier than the outcome.  Didn't tell her?  Yeah.  Good for him.  Wow, that's funny.  Let's see. 
[02:14:00]  Spence didn't tell her.  A Brooklyn Supreme Court jury rendered its verdict Monday saying Spence's number was up.  Has to pay her $3.2 million from the jackpot.  Now, I was always under the assumption that when you win these lottos, whoever has the ticket is the guy.  That's it.  You know?  Bought them together.  There's not enough details in there.  Maybe it was something they used to do every week and go and buy tickets together.  You think?  Yeah, I don't know.  I mean, if that's the case, fine.  But if it's not... 
[02:14:30]  No, that's right.  Whoever has the ticket.  And it doesn't sound like the relationship is all that good if he didn't tell her about it either.  I'll tell you how much...  He probably broke right up with it.  I'll tell you how much of a scumbag I am.  If I was working in an office and we all got together, 12 or 13 people, and we all bought lottery tickets every week,  but I was the guy that bought them and the number hit, it sucks to be used.  Yep, it's just fine.  I run for the hills with the money.  I hate when you see that on TV where the 15 people that got together are in front of the cameras doing the press conference. 
[02:15:00]  And we're all sharing the prize.  Right.  Oh, I hate that.  Yeah, we all get like eight bucks over 20 years.  I would run.  Run, run, run.  Can I share in the lotto winnings?  No, my brother.  You've got to buy your own.  Damn.  All right, there you go.  That's today's...  Today's Bitches...  It's the bitches that are bitches.  It's the bitches that are bitches.  It's the bitches that are bitches.  How awful is it that Joe Pesci actually sang this? 
[02:15:30]  It's the bitches that are bitches.  You see him with this in his Jimmy Hollywood wig?  We got to play that whole segment one of these days when we had him on the phone when he was putting out this album,  Cousin Vinny Sings, whatever it was called, and Opie's just ragging him.  Well, see?  That's some of the things I used to do, Ant.  Yeah.  As I turn over a new leaf.  Oh, Greg. 
[02:16:00]  It's a kinder gentler.  A kinder gentler.  Yeah, you are a lot nicer just trying to get the older man to talk because you know he'll flub eventually.  Shut up.  We were nice to him, weren't we?  Go ahead.  Say that thing you say.  Say that thing you say.  Yeah, just ask Frenchy how nice they are.  You are awful.  Ask Frenchy how kinder and gentler you get.  You know, someone wrote about that.  Hold on.  No?  Oh, yeah.  Paulie from Lawrence.  It's a good thing Buddy Epson isn't a gay Jewish Frenchman.  Otherwise, that could have gotten ugly. 
[02:16:30]  We actually have Robert Clary's, some of his songs he sings.  I've never heard this.  LeBeau?  Have you ever heard LeBeau from Hogan's Heroes sing?  We have one of his albums.  We'll listen to this.  Sounds scary.  Said a scarecrow swinging on a pole  To a blackbird sitting on a fence 
[02:17:00]  For the Lord gave me a soul  But forgot to give me common sense  Said the blackbird  Well, well, well  What in hunger would you do with common sense?  Ooh  Said the scarecrow would be pleasing  Just a reason  Not the reason  And the reason  How about a nice bucket of hay?  And the wince  Got ourselves a pretty little thing 
[02:17:30]  Oh, this is what song is  With the flowers  Consulting with the rain  How's that for a topper?  In my head I'd be scratching  If I only had a brain  Hey  Hey  Hey  I don't rival every riddle  Oh, who's that's doing?  In the individual  In trouble or in pain  Yeah, I got sort of a kind of brain 
[02:18:00]  Ooh  With the thoughts  I'd be thinking  I could be another Lincoln  If I only had a brain  Pucker up and kiss my ass  Ooh  I could tell you  Walk it off  The oceans near the shore  This you are  You're frenzy  I could think of things  I never thunk before  Yeah  And then I'd sit  And think some more  Shut up!  F yourself!  I would not be just a nothing 
[02:18:30]  My head all full of stuff  Shut up!  My heart all full of pain  And perhaps I deserve you  And be even worthier of you  If I only had a brain  Shut up!  Shut up!  Shut up!  Shut up!  Shut up!  Shut up!  Shut up!  Shut up!  Even worthier of you  If I only had a brain  There you go  That's Robert Clary 
[02:19:00]  Guy from Washington  Might be right once again today  We do a show for our own amusement  I don't want to hear  What he sounded like singing  There you go  All right  Can you hear something French?  Call from Boston  Is this aunt's mom again?  No  Not my mom's singing  If I only had a brain  Hey Rob, what's up?  Hey, what's up guys?  How you doing?  Pretty good  You should get the naughty night  You girls to do a live  Six o'clock queef  Oh, look at the time 
[02:19:30]  Oh, it's six o'clock  Are you talented at that?  You don't know how to do that  Or anything?  No?  Look at her  You can't do it  I don't want to know from it  Well, the thing is  It's like some girls  Can't do it on cue  Like that  Yeah  Have you ever done that?  On cue?  Yeah  No  No  I'm not talented enough  How's it in other ways?  Yeah, it's kind of like  A weird little thing  They gotta do  How about if a gentleman  Was to jump on your stomach?  Would that help?  With some chloroform?  It sounds good  It sounds good  Chloroform  It's so stupid  No, one time I hugged my dog 
[02:20:00]  And he queefed after her  It's right after  Oh, yeah  But I don't think it works with humans  How cute  All right, Rob  We're ass out of luck  Wasn't it a surprise party  With peanut butter involved, was it?  That's all right  I got a joke for Norton  Okay  You're gonna like this one  What's the best part  What's the best part  About having sex  With a 12-year-old girl?  I don't like that type of humor  On this show  Good day, sir  And I don't think  There's anything  That needs to be made fun of  About that  There's so many good answers 
[02:20:30]  La, la, la  La, la, la  Look at us  Being responsible  Email me the answer  At a tinkledrinker  At AOL  Okay, here we go  Let's check out the F.U. line  See what's going on today  All right  Hey, thanks for calling  And here's the O.P. and Anthony  F.U. line  Yeah, this is a big F.U. to  You truly are worse than AIDS  I've been waiting since Thursday  For a package  Which was supposed to come  From Queens to Manhattan  How long does it take  For something to go  From Queens to Manhattan?

[02:21:00]  Next message  I'd like to give a big F.U. to my ex-boyfriend Kevin  Who's an A-hole 
[02:21:30]  And left me with all these bills  And a car I can't afford  End of message  Are you ready?  O.P. and Anthony  Are gonna touch you where it's dirty  Take it like a champ, okay?  The O.P. and Anthony Show  Yeah, you're checking out the show  It's called the O.P. and Anthony Show  Yeah  Couple phone numbers  People say we don't give out the numbers enough, Anthony  Well, give them out  In the New York area 
[02:22:00]  877-692-1027  Anywhere else  Including Washington, D.C.  Because we learn so much from Washington, D.C. every day  On a daily basis  We learn how to improve this show  Today we learned that we do a show to amuse ourselves  Yeah, that's what they told us  Quite flattering  Thank you, Washington  The people in Washington  866-277-4WOW  Oh, that wasn't it either  What, this one?  Give us the Lewinsky 
[02:22:30]  Give us  Oh, remember this?  Give us the Lewinsky  Give us  Last night you fell asleep  But I wanna sink it deep  It feels so cool  When you start to drool  But please just watch the teeth  Give us a Lewinsky  Give us a Lewinsky  Bury the bone  So maybe she was talking about us today  Now that I think about it 
[02:23:00]  That's Brother Joe, everyone  It's stuff like that  I forgot all about that song  That is making Monica Lewinsky very angry  Some upcoming HBO special  Features an interview with her  It's called Monica in Black and White  Consists of her answering questions  From an audience of HBO staff  And college students  Yuck  Little piggy whore  She went into it  Everything was cool 
[02:23:30]  But then after a while  She's being asked questions  And she broke down  She broke down in tears  It seems she doesn't like  When her last name is used  To describe a sex act  Like Lewinsky  Like Lewinsky  Giving a Lewinsky  A Bluinski  They've also called it  I'm sure she loves the fame  I'm sure she loves going to  All the hot restaurants in New York  And be invited to all the hot parties  Eating  She got a book deal  She got a book deal  She got to talk to  Barbara Walters 
[02:24:00]  Yeah  And you don't think  She's getting paid for this  For the HBO thing  Getting paid for the HBO thing  She sells what  Those handbag things now  People are buying the handbags  Because of who she is  Yeah  Exactly  But she liked to forget  That  The reason why she's famous  Maybe she shouldn't be  Saving seeds on a dress then  If she doesn't want  That type of notoriety  What's the biggest misconception  People have about her  That I sought this celebrity  By seducing the president  And going to the White House  With an agenda  And turning on him  So all this could happen 
[02:24:30]  So I could enjoy it  And cause trouble for this country  And make millions of dollars  And perpetuate my celebrity  Perpetuate my celebrity  She said  And that I'm stupid  That's what she says  Lewinsky who designs handbags  Bags on her face  Bags on her arm  Whatever  Handbags  Attends classes at Columbia  And wore a black leather jacket 
[02:25:00]  And a skirt  She appeared to fight back tears  When a reporter asked her  About former President Clinton's  Moral standards  I'm flustered right now  She said  I'm so sorry  Why  Exactly  She tried not to answer  A handful of questions  Handful  Of questions  Including how she felt  About Monica Lewinsky jokes  Indicating HBO wanted to save  Responses for the  For the documentary  Eventually  She said  Gallows humor  Helped her  But she doesn't like 
[02:25:30]  How her name  Has become synonymous  With  Sex acts  Like a Lewinsky  New from Spunko  It's the President's  Favorite toy  It's the Lewinsky  Who aims to please  While on her knees  And makes a suckity sound  A slut  A slut  She looks like a mutt  Everyone knows  Lewinsky  Lewinsky  Lewinsky  Her mouth is a wonderful toy  Lewinsky 
[02:26:00]  Lewinsky  She's fine for a horny old boy  There you go  Remember that in the old days?

[02:29:00]  Without somebody being in there  Cleaning  Did you try it again  Again  And the little  That awful bearded man  That guy's always in there  He's always in there  He's got some kind of scam going on  That is so funny  It doesn't matter when you go in there  That is awesome  Walking around  He's so right  I'm sitting there  He doesn't speak English  And he's always scrubbing in there  Yeah  He's got the uniform  So you assume he's  He's supposed to be in there  I bet you he's just a guy  Some perv from the street  That's got a scam  Dude I got the little  The Stephen King book up

[02:30:00]  He looks like  Dreyfuss with AIDS  Get out of the bathroom  You balding nothing  He doesn't even speak English  Don't you want to go  Into a bathroom  When you have to go  And just sit there  And let it all hang out  Yeah and read  You don't have to worry  You want to read  You want to stay there  You want to  Take care of business  You don't want to hear  People walking around  You don't want to hear  The guy pulling toilet paper  Off the roll  In the next one  And hear the crinkle crinkle  In the paper  As he goes to wipe  Yeah that's the wrong 
[02:30:30]  Type of crinkle crinkle  Here in a stall  Of course  You don't want the cleaning guy  Shoving his foot under  You know what you should have done  You should have grabbed  Some out of the ball  And smeared it on his shoe  I couldn't  Like a monkey  Like a monkey  Throw it at him  Two little pieces  Of my Morton steak  From the other night  And I couldn't even enjoy  The rest of it  I had to cut one off  In the middle  And just forget it  And leave  I was so  Do you have no dignity  He's like 55 
[02:31:00]  Have you had no dignity  At that age  Get out when I'm going  To the bathroom  You had to slam it shut  You had to slam shut  No  Clamp down on one  It was one of those  Stubborn ones  That would have taken  Quite a bit of effort  Yeah yeah  A little bit of time  You better off just going  Through the 40 or 50 pieces  Of toilet paper  And moving along  Oh god  Thank you  Yeah the gloves  And the big garbage can  With the little spray things on it  Christ almighty man  If I heard somebody in there  I'd be like  Alright I'll let you go  And I'll get out  But he's sitting in there  And then somebody else  With his vest comes in  I saw him after 
[02:31:30]  Hey how's your day going  He's cleaning toilets  How could his day be going  You're playing the perfect  Comedy club tonight  The stress back there  You're out of your effing mind  Dude that  You're out of your mind today  The little pet peeves of mine  Yeah  And that drives me nuts  If you're in there  Going to the bathroom  I'll accept it  But when you're in there  Cleaning every time  I go in there  Every friggin time  Every time  Yeah  You can't go after 5 o'clock  How clean does a bathroom have to be  It was fine when I went in before  Nothing happened in the last hour 
[02:32:00]  He really is in there a lot  Yeah  The door's all propped open  Yeah  Doing my job  He puts his cart in the doorway  And holds the door open  So now the door's wide open  Yeah  And he probably does that  Just so we can spend some time  In the ladies room  Picking little curly ones  Off the seat  No you're right  He likes mail fumes  Right in the next door  He's cleaning up  We get it Jim  Have a little dignity  You scent enjoying scumbag  We get it  We so get it 
[02:32:30]  Thank you  God damn Norton man  You are having a rough day  Look at you coming on strong  5 minutes before you have to leave  Exactly  I finally have something  That I can't trip over  I should have had some chloroform  To put on him  A little chloroform  Keep him from cleaning  Chloroform  Andrew  Hey guys  Hey what's up  Hey Ope  I just heard you singing  How many shots do I have to take  Oh  That's part of the drinking game

Is too observant  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah they are kind of  Pointing out things like that  Like we do at Joe  Show just for ourselves  For amusement  Yeah  Gotta agree with that 
[02:33:30]  That's classic  Dave from Jersey  The Batboy reference was good  As far as what  Jim Norton looks like  But I think Norton looks more like  Babyface Fenster  The bank robber  From the Bugs Bunny cartoon  Oh  Fenster  They put pictures of me  As Baby Fenster  On the message board  Thinks the baby  Naughty baby  Yeah that was great  That Froy sure is a fine looking young man  Young neat hairdo  Good chin  Hey you find Froy from the message board attractive  I'm not gay 
[02:34:00]  I just want to tussle his hair  And go good job Matthew  Dude speaking of chins  You got the weakest one  I've ever seen man  No I've been talking about it for years  It's non-existent  I look reptilian  I should be on a rock  Just milking my own little fat bosoms  You don't even have  I'm trying to take a dump  While that scumbag  Follows me around  Look how red his thin lips are  Because there's not enough  Layers of skin  No they're all  My lower lip is almost human  And a woman likes  A nice European  Gentleman's lips  To kiss  Fuller lips 
[02:34:30]  Like the type  I'm sure Garrett has  Yeah  But mine are just  My upper lip is just  Revolting  Oh my god  Sucks  I honestly said that  To a girlfriend one time  After  I'm not kidding  After sex  I was naked on the bed  And I'm collapsing  And my breasts  And my stomach  Are mushing together  And I honestly said to her  How do you F me?  And I meant it  I wasn't kidding  I wasn't trying to be funny  I just said it to her 
[02:35:00]  And she's like  What?  How do you do it?  Whoa man  Weasley chin  That's something  And then Opie yesterday  Had to point out  About your receptacle  My what?  The receptacle  On the back of your head  Well he says it in his act  Look at the top of his head  What about it?  It looks like a condom tip  Yeah  And Opie you like pointing it out  Well I like pointing out  All the stuff on his head  It's awful  It's fun  Little spots  And the missing hair in the back  It's an atrocity  He's like 33  And he's got liver spots 
[02:35:30]  Already on his arm  I've had them since I was 8  You've never seen liver spots?  Yeah I don't  My head looks like  Henry Fonda's hand  It's disgraceful  Have you used that one on stage yet?  Never  I don't look that closely  At anybody around here  To really  Because it's  It's as entertaining  As Tim Sabian slacks  I'm telling you  It's a mess  To find new things on his head  That are just wrong  Let me tell you  Let me tell you something though  Mr. Disgusto  That you like to 
[02:36:00]  To talk about yourself  I have never seen  Anyone involved  With this program  That has gotten  More emails  And phone calls  From girls  That want to go out  With you  Met you at the club  Talked to you  You're so nice  Have you seen  Some of these pigs  That call me?

[02:38:00]  Not only that  He keeps the door wide open  With something propped up against it  So anybody can walk in  Yeah well that's it  I really want to punch him in his face  I don't want to be funny with him  I just want to punch him in his face  That's what he looks like  He's living the  Boys he's here for his noon feeding  Alright faggot  Put your face by the bowl  I'm finished  He's living the American dream  Yeah scrubbing toilets  With gloves  He doesn't speak English  He does speak English  He was talking to the other guy  He said how are you  Fine  We've never heard him talk before  He does not speak English  You say hi to him 
[02:38:30]  He goes  Look he does  He does  The guy's a sick bastard  He'll be in that bathroom  Until 8 o'clock  Guaranteed  Every night  From 5 to 8  I don't know what he does  That's funny  Hey Anthony  Can we try the unlucky lottery again  We should just all go in there  And leak on the floor  Dude  I don't know how tempted I was  To not flush  The poor guy  To not flush  I was so tempted  Have you also noticed how  This floor is such a bunch of degenerates  Because they have signs in our bathroom  They have to put signs  That say clean up 
[02:39:00]  Like don't leave paper  I've walked into some of those stalls  Before he's gotten in there  And it looks like the military  Dropped a daisy cutter  In one of the balls  It's got  I mean I'm talking collateral damage  You could rope it off  As a crime scene  Crime scene  They should have the yellow police  Get the F out of here tape up  Easy line to say  But we've seen stuff on the walls  Yeah  On the walls  Of the stall  I'm sure he puts it there  Just so he can come back in  And clean it  How many bathrooms though  In New York  Do you go into  And there's signs 
[02:39:30]  On every stall  When you're done with your business  Clean up  Clean up  None  You know what pissed me off  I'll just tell you  They changed this finally  The toilet paper dispenser  Let me just tell you  About the toilet paper dispenser  It used to be  On some spring loaded mechanism  That you would have  Problem pulling belt steel  Off of a roll  Without it ripping  Never mind toilet paper  Every piece  Would rip 
[02:40:00]  You'd get a half a piece  In your hand  You're wiping with confetti  When you're done  Pulling this off  And then they'd leave notes  Written on the door  Don't leave pieces of toilet paper  Laying on the floor  So I jotted  Get some new  F'n toilet paper rolls  And you know what  They did  We got them  Now it comes off  Like Niagara Falls  Whoa  You're going to wipe for you  Aren't I friend  Often do  You reminded me of something though  We went out to dinner last night  A bunch of us  And I go
