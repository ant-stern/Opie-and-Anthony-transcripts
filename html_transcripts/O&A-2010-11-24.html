<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics in a highly irreverent and often offensive manner.  The show opened with a discussion of a viral video showing a man exposing himself on a New York City subway, focusing on the woman's amused reaction and sparking a debate about women's responses to such situations.  This led to anecdotes about similar experiences and listener calls sharing personal accounts, interspersed with unrelated tangents about the hosts' studio TVs, the geopolitical situation in Korea, and a racially insensitive episode of *Happy Days*.

The conversation then shifted to Justin Bieber's music video, heavily critiquing his singing and dancing, and making frequent use of racial slurs and offensive language.  The discussion also included brief mentions of other celebrities (Ludacris, Donny Osmond, Michael Jackson, Leif Garrett, and Elvis Presley), Derek Jeter's contract negotiations, a news story about another subway flasher, and a lengthy digression on the perceived racism in *Happy Days*.  Steve-O and Rich Vos joined the show in studio.  Steve-O spoke about his stand-up career, detailing both a negative experience in Marco Island and a more positive one elsewhere.  His discussion then became graphic, focusing on his sexual habits and preferences, including detailed descriptions of pornography and personal encounters.  This led to conversations about the sexual experiences of other comedians and Steve-O's own sobriety struggles, contrasted with his past drug use and hallucinations.

A phone call with Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson briefly interrupted this segment, discussing his career transition from wrestling to acting, his relationship with Vince McMahon, and current film projects.  The conversation returned to Steve-O, covering his high school reunion and other personal anecdotes before concluding with further sexually explicit comments and discussions about Sarah Palin and political correctness concerning terminology for people of short stature and racial groups.  

A significant portion of the show featured Noel Biderman, founder of Ashley Madison, CougarLife.com, and EstablishedMen.com.  The discussion began with a tangent on racial profiling at airports and political correctness regarding the term "handicapped," before transitioning to Biderman's defense of his websites.  He discussed the demographics of his user base, website features designed for anonymity, marketing challenges, and the motivations behind infidelity, including economic factors and the influence of pornography.  His wife also participated, offering her perspective.  The segment touched upon the demise of Craigslist's erotic services section and anecdotes about the infidelity of athletes and celebrities.  Steve-O was mentioned as having been present in the studio earlier.  The show ended with Biderman promoting his websites and the hosts promoting their upcoming comedy shows.

[00:04:00]  Even that's hard to do, but you think he's more of an oops guy, like, oh, whoa, whoa.  No, she said he was rubbing on her.  And then she looked down and his dick is out.  The dick is out.  Do women find this funny?  Women find it hysterically funny.  I don't feel like it's violating.  I don't feel like it's violating.  Take a train and try to take a train and try to find that woman.  I don't need to do that or see that.  But it goes into the silly funny category. 
[00:04:30]  This broad took care of herself.  No, she definitely did.  She took care of herself all right because that guy was thoroughly embarrassed the entire-  Humiliated.  Until that train stopped and the cops, I think, grabbed him, right?  Why'd they turn the cell phone- do a video of it and they turned it off?  Hmm.  That's what I said.  The guy-  Just when the video's getting good, the guy goes, well, I have enough video for YouTube.  No, you don't.  Keep filming.  Keep going.  Or videotaping or-  Yeah, I don't know. 
[00:05:00]  Or shooting or whatever.  I just call it recording now.  I go old school.  I say film.  I wonder if you ran out of fucking memory.  Keep filming.  Keep filming, right?  Keep rolling that film.  I know.  I'm aware that we don't film things anymore.  Yeah.  Or the average person doesn't, certainly.  Or tape.  Or tape.  Yeah, keep taping it.  Ling-ling.  Keep HD-ing.  I just say capturing.  Keep capturing?  You say capturing?  Yeah, I do.  No, you don't.  Are you going to capture that?  Well, there's-  Capture.  Covers every medium.  There's fucking videos everywhere.  Uh, yeah. 
[00:05:30]  We have eight TVs in our studio.  Yeah.  Much to the chagrin of the rest of the people that work here at SiriusXM.  Well, if we can't get anything else, we got TVs.  That's the one thing we were able to hold onto.  That's the one thing we were able to really squeak out.  You watch what happens when these pictures, these TVs start breaking down.  Yeah.  You watch how it goes from eight to seven to six.  We're not going to get them replaced, you don't think?  No.  No.  No.  They won't really quickly just replace our television.  No.  We had another one right there, right?  Didn't we have four? 
[00:06:00]  Where did we have the other one?  The Nagel Tron will be in here.  Big fucking mess.  We always had eight.  I thought we had one that they took out.  We did have one that they took out.  Oh, you're right.  Yeah, yeah.  Where was that single one?  We weren't happy about that.  Is it in the corner over there?  Yeah.  It might have been.  We did have nine, right?  You want to say it?  Then just say it, Jimmy.  It was under there.  I want to make a definitive statement.  I want to say...  Well, let's play the audio of this video that everyone's talking about today.  Crazy bitch.  So she's on a subway here in New York City.  Guy decides to, I believe, take his penis out and rub it against her. 
[00:06:30]  Rub against her.  Oh, God.  It's hilarious.  It really is.  It really is.  I want one woman to call up and tell me that's hilarious and that you're not horrified  by that.  I understand.  I understand why...  As long as you're not being dragged into a bush somewhere.  I think it's really funny.  Well...  I understand why she was mad and I understand why he did it.  You can see both sides of the story.  I can play devil's advocate very easily here.  Yeah!  Got my cock out.  Rubbing a calf with it.  Yeah, let's play it from there so we can see the video. 
[00:07:00]  Let's, let's see this.  Let me see your penis.  Yeah, I'm serious.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, and I'm like, why does this person keep pressing up against me and I realize  that you have all this fucking space here and I stink his penis out.  Oh.  That's it.  Oh, you're gonna fucking arrest him.  I'm not leaving your side.  My plans are done for tonight.  I'm just escorting you to the police station.  She's sassy.  Oh, yes.  Oh, fucking yes.  I know what I saw. 
[00:07:30]  Flipping the hair.  Where the fuck is the conductor?  Oh, this shit's going on YouTube, yo.  Where is the conductor?  We can take a picture of the penis with the condom.  Oh, it's here.  It's there, alright.  The penis with the condom.  You're ridiculous, man.  And then they stop.  Why stop?  What do you want to save your fucking...  Exposed himself to her.  Memories?  This is on the four train in Midtown.  She's furious.  She calls him out in front of the entire train.  Check this out.  They block her face up. 
[00:08:00]  I'm not leaving your side.  My plans are done for tonight.  I just want to see if the news people find it hilarious like we do.  Oh, yeah.  They're gonna be outraged, right?  Yeah.  I know what I saw.  The hair flip is great.  Now, speaking out really made a difference.  Police quickly arrested 51-year-old Mario Valdivia of Queens, charging him with public lewdness  and sex abuse.  Quick action.  All right.  Now, we've got Shay Ryan in the house.  She doesn't even want to comment.  Quick reaction.  She doesn't want to comment.  Quick reaction. 
[00:08:30]  He looks like Jeff Goldblum.  Yeah, yeah.  Didn't he?  I want to see the other views because you see all the cameras.  Oh, there's one.  There's another guy filming in the background and then another camera popped in.  This is the Kennedy assassination.  She was sassy, though.  Without the...  Oh, yes.  Oh, yes.  You hit the hair.  Oh, yes.  You're going.  I'm escorting you.  She was sexy, too.  I show her my dick.  Just lead him by his cock to the police station.  Grab onto it like a fucking rope.  Come here, asshole.  The rubbing part happened to Jess once on a train. 
[00:09:00]  Did it?  Yeah.  Oh, Jess got rubbed?  Well, do tell.  Do tell.  When she was in Paris abroad in college.  Paris?  Yeah.  She went to school in Paris?  First semester.  You know that, man.  What?  She has been violated by some uncut French fucking...  Yeah.  Penis.  ...Casanova.  Some guy who works eight hours a week.  Yes.  Comes home with a big baguette in his bag and in his pants.  She had a different boyfriend at the time.  I don't know what happened.  Really?  Was he French? 
[00:09:30]  No.  Do you think she went French?  I don't think so.  She might have went French once.  I think she did.  Did she go Greek?  That's terrible.  Did she go Greek in Paris?  I'm kidding.  Do you know the Jess I talk about is a character Jess?  It's not the real person.  It's not the real person.  Right.  It's Sam Roberts' girlfriend.  Right.  Sam Roberts from the show.  Primetime Sam Roberts.  Primetime Sam's imaginary girlfriend.  Sure.  Yeah.  But she is indeed a real person and she didn't find it hilarious when she was...  Oh really?  Because she was sitting on...  She was on the train standing.  It was like a crowded train.  Was it in the middle of the Chunnel? 
[00:10:00]  No.  No.  She wasn't traveling to England.  I thought it was the Chunnel.  I've always wanted to take the Chunnel.  Who doesn't?  We wanted to.  So what happened?  But so the guy had a full erection.  Oh.  And he just started rubbing her ass.  Wouldn't that make her feel good?  Like wow.  I'm pretty dicky.  I'm getting this guy like really excited.  No.  I mean it probably made her feel like threatened.  Oh.  Yeah.  But it wasn't skin to skin.  Right.  But still it was...  I'm still going with hilarious.  His intimate area against her. 
[00:10:30]  She was invading her space to say the least.  Did he leave a little pre on her...  No.  Why was she bending over or tying her shoes?  She wasn't bending over.  She was just standing there.  Why was she touching her toes?  Yeah.  Doing calisthenics.  Why would she be sitting Indian style on the floor?  But he did it once.  Yeah.  And then backed up.  And she started getting really...  She's got a terrible temper.  She's very small.  Oh.  But she's got a for real temper.  But don't fuck with her right?  Yeah.  She gets very mad.  Uh...  She's got... 
[00:11:00]  You have no idea.  She's got some of the European in her.  I don't know.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, she's half Jewish.  I don't know.  Okay.  Right.  So what happened?  Let's go.  So then the second time he started rubbing against her.  She's only five feet tall, but she turned around and she stuck her finger in his face  and said, nobody likes that.  And he stopped immediately.  He said, oh, okay.  Did...  Maybe... 
[00:11:30]  She said...  Maybe she...  He thought, like, people did like that.  Yeah, that's right.  She was telling him.  Well, apparently that's like the fantasy that these guys fantasize about women really  getting a kick out of this.  So when a woman brings in the reality of the situation that she is uncomfortable by  this and nobody likes it...  She learned that somewhere.  I don't know.  She learned that in a rape book.  Her instincts kicked right in.  A rape book?  She learned that in a rape book.  I don't know.  There's a rape book?  There's a rape book out there.  Take that out in the library?  Yes.  You've never seen any rape books on the shelf.  Is that in pure science?  Yes, it sure is. 
[00:12:00]  It's all those things.  The rape book.  One time I was on a train to the Bronx for Yankee game years ago, and the woman in  front of me, Spanish lady, I think, her ass was pressed against my dick.  It literally was a crowded train going to a Yankee game.  Yeah.  You're out of your mind, right?  I had a fucking rod.  Did you get a rod?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And I am convinced, or I was at that moment that she liked it, that she was comfortable  with it.  Because she could have...  It's little things, like when you pull back...  I had one time, like, you can test, like, when you pull back, and all of a sudden, if  the other person, you find them, they'll go against you... 
[00:12:30]  You know a little too much.  I've had it happen a couple times.  A couple times.  You know a little too much about the feeling out if you're gonna get that redheaded chick,  or you're gonna get fucking the Spanish chick.  The Spanish chick that's gonna move backwards a little bit for ya.  Yeah.  Isn't there some kind of thing that, a movie with Rosie Perez or something, where she was  grinding...  Yeah, there's a...  It's a really old...  It's gotta be at least 10 years old at this point, but it was like a collection of these  short stories that all took place in the New York City subway. 
[00:13:00]  I don't remember this.  And there was one story where Rosie Perez gets onto a crowded rush hour morning train every  morning at the same time, and this guy is in her car, and he has his hand on, like,  low on the pole, and she goes up every morning and, like, gets off on his head.  Oh, really?  Wow.  Until the one day where he decides to ask her, like, what her name is, or if she wants coffee,  and then she just gets disgusted and storms off.  Because the whole fantasy was that it only happened on that train, and that morning they  was silent, no words.  And he never said a word, it just happened.  Yeah.  And the minute he said something, ruin it, and that was it. 
[00:13:30]  Hey, you wanna go out?  Yeah.  I don't blame him, but you'd have to eventually say it.  Eventually.  I guess this happens a lot, huh?  This rubbing and exposing on the subway.  We had the other guy where the lady took the picture.  Yeah, it took a little snapshot.  And humiliated the guy that owned restaurants or something.  Remember that guy?  Sitting there, just jerking.  And she said, fuck that, and pulled out her camera and got a picture of it.  Yeah.  And now we got the fiery redhead.  Why would you pick her?  Oh, yes.  Oh, yes. 
[00:14:00]  She obviously is a problem.  I know.  Generally speaking, though, I think it would be safe to assume that women don't get on  the subway hoping to see a penis.  You think?  I think so.  I think there's a few out there, Sam.  I mean, that's probably the rare exception, though.  I would imagine.  Yeah.  You think that's a rare exception?  I think so.  They probably just want to get to where they're going.  I think it's about 40%.  Yeah.  40%.  I think that's a way overestimation.  I think that's a way overestimation.  Four out of ten.  I think that might be...  Yeah, three out of the ten want the rubbing to occur.  Oh. 
[00:14:30]  I mean, that's a huge percentage.  Your odds are actually pretty good.  You know?  That's what I'm saying.  That's why I think it might be a little high.  Not too bad.  Can we dress you up as a woman and see if any guys, like, rub their penises against you  in some way?  I don't think I'd rub it on him now.  Exactly.  I don't think I'd make an attractive woman.  I have a big forehead.  You sure do.  I love that.  All the better to come on.  Jesus.  His forehead's perfect to rest your asshole on while his nose nuzzles your balls and his 
[00:15:00]  lips gently teased the shaft of your cock.  How bad do you want to make an asshole print on his forehead right now?  Desperately.  It's the big pucker right in the middle of it like it's Ash Wednesday.  It's a brown spot.  I have a long taint that would cover, like, right down the bridge of his nose.  Can we do that just for the radio?  No.  It's a radio bit.  Just stop flirting with me.  It's not a homo bit.  It's a radio bit.  No.  Radio bit.  I'm a professional.  Not gay.  So hopefully another angle of this thing comes out with a guy that knows how to, you 
[00:15:30]  know, shoot things properly and not stop the camera when it's getting good.  Or a picture of the penis with a condom.  There's shit like that that makes me think maybe there are UFOs, like, and people just  too stupid to fucking record them.  Yeah.  Because that guy had, like, there was still shit going on.  Of course there were.  Like, wait till the door opens.  Wait till the cops get there.  See what this fucking crazy woman does.  Maybe he had a shitty phone.  That looks like an iPhone, right?  No?  I don't know.  I'm not gonna fuck it.  Huh?  There's lots of cameras that take video that look like that. 
[00:16:00]  I'm not selling out no iPhones.  My Blackberry doesn't shoot like that, though.  What camera shoots where it's like...  A lot of Droid phones do it.  That's like a Droid?  Your phone doesn't.  It's not full screen.  Why is that?  Well, it's very frustrating.  People need to turn their phones when they're videoing with their iPhones.  Just turn the phone and it's widescreen movie.  Widescreen!  Looks great.  Right.  Even on an HD TV and I would know.  You would know.  You would barely know.  You're barely in that world.  I'm so in that world.  Simmons, you 32 inches. 
[00:16:30]  She's just...  Every aspect of her is don't fuck with this chick.  Don't pull your cock out for her.  Don't pull your cock out.  It's so obvious.  Don't pull your cock out for this girl.  She's very pretty, though.  We should play a game.  Like, show us a few pictures and we'll teach this guy.  Look at her.  Look at her.  She's just fired up.  Which ones you pull your cock out to and which ones you don't?  Yeah.  This chick means business.  Never a redhead.  No.  Just leave the fucking gingers alone on the train. 
[00:17:00]  No, yeah.  I like how she's telling everybody and she's calling it a penis.  She's yelling.  She's just yelling.  What happened?  And she's looking around like at other people like, right?  This fucking cock is up.  What the fuck?  Right?  Yeah.  The hair flip is great.  Can you hear that again?  I'd like to hear that again.  What?  The one right?  Her.  Yeah.  Because the news is not going to play it real.  That's great.  I love it.  This guy's miserable.  Let me see your penis.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm serious. 
[00:17:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And I'm like, why is this person talking up against me and I realize that you have all  this fucking face here.  And I see his penis out.  That's it.  Oh, you're going to fucking arrest him.  I'm not leaving your side.  My plans are done for tonight.  I'm escorting you to the police station.  Okay?  Oh, yes.  Oh, fucking yes.  I know what I saw.  Where the fuck is the conductor?  She's classic.  Oh, there's shit coming on YouTube, yo.  Where is the conductor? 
[00:18:00]  We can take a picture of the penis with the condom.  Oh, it's there.  It's there, alright.  The penis with the condom.  You ridiculous, man.  Because I...  What did that guy say?  The penis with a condom.  The penis with a condom.  And there is the guy.  You're right.  The other guy's filming.  Yeah, I want to see that footage, man.  Where's his?  And he's filming like he's supposed to with the phone flipped widescreen.  Right.  Yeah, that guy knew what he was doing.  That footage pops up.  Greatest fucking footage of it.  He probably shot the penis with the condom and he can't put it on YouTube.  What's the penis with the condom?  I guess the guy... 
[00:18:30]  What do you think?  He must have had a condom on.  He might have had a condom on.  He probably comes into it.  Safe rubbing.  Holy shit, this guy's like fucking...  Maybe a secretor.  A professional.  He's a secretor.  Doesn't want DNA on the girls.  Is he a secretor?  Yeah.  He's one of those secretors.  Yeah, his dick is like a slug.  Oh, yes.  Oh, yes.  Oh, yes.  Oh, yes.  Oh, yes.  Oh, yes.  Oh, yes.  My plans are done.  She's so fucking pissed.  Would you ever go out with a girl like that?  Love to.  Get the fuck out of here.  She's fiery.  She's fiery.  She's fun for maybe a weekend. 
[00:19:00]  She'd pipe down and eat her ass.  And that all becomes a nightmare.  Eat her ass and she fucking...  She'd pipe down?  She simmers right down.  Simmer down.  Simmers right the fuck down.  I'm gonna eat your ass.  You simmer down now.  Jess would get that mad.  She would get that mad?  100%, yes.  If somebody did that to her, she'd get that.  Would she be like, oh, yes.  Oh, yeah.  Well, what was her line again?  From the rape book?  Well, from a rape book.  The rape book.  She knew what she was doing.  Someone taught her properly.  She put her little finger in the guy's face and said, nobody likes that. 
[00:19:30]  And that guy got stopped and looked embarrassed.  He got the equivalent of the zonk on a game show.  Yes.  The whammy.  It's like, oh, you picked the wrong girl.  Oh, look what you went and did.  Let me tell you something.  Nobody wants to keep jerking off to a screaming woman on the train.  Oh.  No.  Any woman, no matter how menacing the guy is, just start yelling, oh, he's got his penis 
[00:20:00]  out.  And he will put it away.  Well, no.  And leave.  Nobody likes that.  It's perfect.  Yeah, it's great.  Nobody likes it.  Right in his face, right?  Yeah.  But remember, Sam, 4 out of 10 do.  I don't think that's the case.  I think almost all women really don't like that.  3 out of 10 want skin to skin contact on the subway.  Where'd you get these stats?  From the rape book?  From the rape book.  The rape book?  Yeah, there's stats in the back.  I mean, I think 1940.  Most women love it.  Not only do they not like it, but they probably don't think it's very funny either. 
[00:20:30]  They just...  No, she didn't think it was funny.  No, I think most women probably feel violated and get very angry at it.  This guy's a dope because this woman's not even showing any sexuality.  You see the, like, the skirt she's wearing?  It's all the way to the floor.  Pat from Monaki brings up a great point.  He goes, this girl wouldn't mind breaking up in public.  Like, she's a scene maker in a restaurant.  Oh, yeah.  She is a scene maker.  And then you give me that shit?  Well, it's fucking over, mister! 
[00:21:00]  And you're sitting at the table like, oh my god, you're making a scene.  And she's coming home from work.  Imagine her with a few drinks in her.  Oh, your cocktail time!  Get the fuck out of here.  I've been happy hours of pissing with her.  Well, that's your story of the day.  That's great.  That's everywhere today.  That's great.  Big fiery red bush.  Chapella doesn't trim it.  Why shouldn't she trim it for a man?  Fuck him!  You know how embarrassed that guy is, Mario?  He was embarrassed immediately, too. 
[00:21:30]  He's just like...  And you could see he was probably pleading with her because he was like,  No.  No.  She's like, oh, yeah!  Oh, yeah!  Oh, yeah!  Oh, yeah!  He's probably just going, no.  And the guy's like, let me see your penis!  And he's just like, oh, now the guys are chiming in.  Now the guys are making fun of him.  Now it's not even sexy anymore.  Like, if it's just a girl yelling at my dick, it's one thing.  But now the guys are yelling at my dick.  Trying to get their blackberries so they can take pictures of his little penis with a condom.  With a condom on.  Yeah.  Penis with a condom.  Penis with a condom.  Coming up.  It's like a diner. 
[00:22:00]  It's like a short order cook.  Penis with a condom!  It should be the headline of every newspaper today.  Penis with a condom.  Penis with a condom.  Love that guy.  Unfortunately, no women calling in saying they laugh at this type of thing.  No, I don't.  I think it's funny.  That's because you're not a woman.  You don't have penises rubbed on you.  I understand the difference of being pulled into like a dark alley or something.  Well, that's actual rape.  This is on a subway and some idiot is pulling his penis out.  I would imagine if you're a woman, you're laughing.  There are probably degrees of assault.  They rubbed it on her. 
[00:22:30]  Rubbing is a little rough.  I bet there were some women on that train watching the shenanigans that were laughing  because the guy was being so degraded in front of this woman.  After, yeah.  But I don't think any woman who's having this perpetrated upon them is enjoying it.  Yeah.  Or would start chungling.  Look at this guy's dick.  That shit is hilarious.  It's on me.  Look at this.  Hey, everybody.  I wasn't going to say anything, but I'm just laughing too hard here.  I got to share.  Yeah, there's a dick on my ass. 
[00:23:00]  Women have to put up with so much fuck.  Like, they hate us so much.  Oh, I know.  This girlfriend and the one before said, you just have no idea as a guy how many fucking  times a day, little things, a guy makes a remark, a guy looks at you uncomfortably,  you have to pretend you didn't see it.  Everywhere you go, there's some creep who wants to fuck you.  We got the women finally calling in.  I know they're going to agree with me.  I'm Megan in DC.  Megan is a regular to the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:23:30]  What's up, Megan?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  So I'm done with what Jimmy's talking about, except, you know, I was on the other end.  So I agree that women sometimes know and like it.  Sure.  But he can't be like a disgusting little pervert.  He has to be like kind of normal.  Like, you wouldn't mind a hot guy, you're saying, rubbing his dick on you in a train?  So it all comes down to...  He doesn't even have to be hot enough that I would sleep with him, but he has to be at  least normal enough.  See, I'm telling you, man. 
[00:24:00]  Oh, God.  You don't laugh at me, but I've read the rape book.  So far, let me tell you something.  So far, 100% of the girls that have called this show want a dick rubbed on them in a train.  Doesn't Jess count for one?  I'm talking to you.  I said call the show.  She's too proper.  Jesus.  Yeah.  100%.  Yeah.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Obviously, he's read the rape book.  Thank you.  But no, it's higher than that.  It's 100%.  As long as he smells okay and he's got some beef in his pants.  Right. 
[00:24:30]  Beef in his...  Have you backed up a little bit on a subway, Megan?  Yeah.  That's what I'm saying.  Maybe it was Jenny.  Oh, you backed that shit up right on there?  I would like that, Megan.  You got a little Spanish in you?  Uh, no.  Did you?  Because Jimmy was talking about a Spanish girl.  Oh.  He said that he's done it a lot of times, so you never know.  I can think of two different times where I've had, once where it was blatant, but the  other time was probably like less than a year ago, but I kept moving back.  I really, I don't want to get yelled at or whatever. 
[00:25:00]  Yeah.  And I noticed her ass would come back a little bit, but I didn't push it.  There's probably some big black guy in front of her pushing his cock into her pussy.  Or a knife in her.  She's just walking backwards to get out of the way of him and backing up into your fucking cock.  Why don't we take-  She was sammaged.  Why don't we take the D train back and forth all day with sweatpants on and see what happens?  Like pup tenting?  Yeah, why don't we fucking do our own little story and a rest?  I was on the train once, this was a long time ago, and there was this guy, he looked  like Adebisi from Oz.  Oh, shit. 
[00:25:30]  And he was wearing sweatpants and they were like baggy, baggy sweatpants.  And he was just trying to kick game to some girl, and like, you know, she was cool  with it.  Like, she was like smiling and blushing and flirting with him.  But his cock was getting so hard and he sweatpants.  Just talking to him?  What the fuck was he?  He had to like stick his-  Black bobo.  He had to like stick his ass out and lean into her to try to like hide as much dick as  possible.  Oh, really?  He was like trying to pull back?  He must have had 14 inches in the sweatpants.  It was ridiculous.  He was trying to hide it?  Yeah, a little bit. 
[00:26:00]  Because he knew what was going on.  The weapon.  He knew that she saw what was going on, but like he kind of half didn't care.  Because he knew what he was packing, so.  Hey, let's continue the survey here.  Maria in New York.  So far 100%.  Maria.  Yes.  What's going on?  You guys are awesome.  I'm so glad I finally got on.  And I just wanted to call because I actually, like years ago when I was in high school,  I went to a fucking ECW wrestling thing.  Nice.  My friend's brother.  I get to.  But anyway, while we were, while we were actually, we had standing room and you know, 
[00:26:30]  seats or whatever.  So I was just kind of standing in the back and this guy just started like feeling me  up and I kind of let it happen because he was a good looking guy, but.  At an ECW show?  What did he say?  At an ECW show?  A good looking guy at an ECW show.  You know what?  He actually was.  So I kind of let it happen.  I mean, but I think what you guys were talking about, the whole penis, you know, out in public  up against your ass or whatever, that's kind of creepy.  But you sit there and got your tits felt up by some stranger at a wrestling show. 
[00:27:00]  At a wrestling show.  It was under the shirt but over the bra, so.  Under the shirt?  What?  Was he crying saying it was still real to him?  It's still real to me.  They feel real to me.  Under the shirt over the bra is okay, I guess.  No, it's not okay.  All right.  I'm learning a lot of things today.  In the rape book, it says.  Awesome, guys.  Thanks.  Under the shirt but over the bra.  Is okay.  Is okay. 
[00:27:30]  Yes.  Like that?  Yeah, yeah.  Is that what it says?  Yeah.  All right.  Let's go to Detroit.  Oh, shit.  What happens in the day?  Oh, Christ.  Robin, what happens in the day?  Is there even subways in the day?  There's no pants.  There's just fucking blatant ass fucking going on.  We don't have subways, but we have what's called a people mover, which is like an above-ground tram.  It's called a police car.  The party wagon.  It's a lot nicer than what I was going to say.  Oh, shit.  Jimmy.  I've gone to Subway in New York.  I would love some guy to whip this dick out because I would humiliate the shit out of him. 
[00:28:00]  Now, if I was on the people mover and somebody did it, I'd probably be more afraid of the other savages on the train than I would have the guys.  All right, Robin.  Let's slow the fuck down, man.  You said if you were in New York, you would humiliate the guy.  What would be your line?  Jess had a great line.  What was her line again?  Nobody likes that.  What would your line be, Robin?  My line would be, why do you got your fucking cock out, you asshole? 
[00:28:30]  And I wouldn't want everybody's attention to it.  Oh, see.  You're not savvy enough for New York.  Not just reviews in the day.  What would Jess say in New York, Sam?  She would look at a person, no matter how big they are.  How big they are.  In the pants?  No, not in the pants.  She wouldn't know that.  She'd feel it.  Wow.  She'd be feeling it at this point.  She gets the finger on her face.  But she would stop feeling.  Yeah.  She would turn around, all five feet, point her finger up into his face.  And go, hey you, get your goddamn dick off her. 
[00:29:00]  Me.  She would say, nobody likes that.  Fucking biff.  There's a lot of biffs on the train.  Yeah.  I'm going to rub my dick on you, Lorraine!  One day you'll make me cum!  And Lorraine was not a fan.  Nah, well, she was in the car for quite a while.  All right.  I don't know.  She needed a savior.  It was funny, I think.  50%.  Huh? 
[00:29:30]  50% now.  One for, one against.  Yes.  What about the third woman we had?  She's a ECW girl.  She got felt up in an ECW show.  That doesn't mean she likes to get consulted on trains.  Give me some percentage points for that, man.  Yeah, but I still think it would be funny, so I'm still 100%.  Oh, she said funny.  Taking a subway with a boy.  Getting a dick rubbed on you by a boy.  Robin, would you be horrified if a guy whips out his dick on a subway or the people mover?  Would I be horrified?  I wouldn't be horrified.  I would still think it's funny, but I think it would be funny to humiliate him. 
[00:30:00]  But in Detroit, it's a whole lot more dangerous.  We don't understand that.  Certainly, no.  I'm sticking up for the broads today.  I think they could handle themselves is what I'm saying.  And they're not like little prisses and running away scared and horrified.  As long as they're not being dragged into the woods or something.  Yep.  You didn't say 40% like it.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  It's not even a radio bid anymore.  I'm telling you, 4 out of 10 girls don't mind this.  I'm telling you.  Okay. 
[00:30:30]  I love a cock pulled out.  That's all I gotta say.  What are you talking about?  I'm telling you, even in Detroit.  Yes.  Even in Detroit.  Nobody likes their dick.  Dick.  Nobody likes to be shamed publicly for taking their penis out.  No.  Any woman yelling at a man for rubbing his dick on her in a fucking train is gonna humiliate  him.  It's humiliating.  By the way, Anthony, I got some backup too.  Emily Post.  This is from Jordan and Scred PA.  Emily Post says, under the shirt, over the bra is okay as long as you keep your pinky 
[00:31:00]  up.  She is the queen of etiquette.  She sure is, Ant.  She sure is.  That ECW story reminded me.  I was at a concert once and I saw this girl with a guy behind her.  I thought they were together because of how close they were.  Oh, no.  But then I kept seeing that she kept kind of pushing him back.  And I just figured that she was uncomfortable or whatever.  She just wanted some room.  But then it kept happening.  So I kind of just leaned into her and I was like, is this guy with you?  And she just looked at me and she went, no.  Wow.  Was he just hammered and fucking?  He was just like, just some Spanish guy who was just kind of like rubbing up against 
[00:31:30]  her.  Like, you know, his dick wasn't out, but he was definitely like rubbing on her.  And she didn't like it.  No, she did not like that.  And I spent the rest of the concert not enjoying myself and basically protecting this  girl from this other guy's cock.  Did you get laid?  No.  No.  The concert was over and she just left.  I know.  I kind of felt like she should have done something for me.  Did you say anything?  No.  I just shoved him back and then like kind of protected her.  I was like using myself as like a shield.  So if he's going to rub it.  Yeah, I did.  Well, your juicy rump wouldn't be a deterrent. 
[00:32:00]  She was very, you could tell on her face she was clearly upset by that.  What did the guy do when you pushed him?  No, he just looked at me and I just kind of stared at him.  Like, I know what you're doing.  You know?  And she doesn't like it so I'm not going to let you do it.  That was it.  Damn.  Let's say hi to Sue in Jersey.  Sue!  Sorry.  Sorry Spanish man.  Hey guys.  I've seen more strange penis than people that I've slept with.  Wow.  Wow.  It happened to me.  I think the best one is it happened to me in Atlantic City and I was leaning over 
[00:32:30]  to make a bet and somebody like threw the pants hard on right between my ass cheeks  and I turned around.  Well, first of all, I guess I did check out the guy.  Were you at the craps table?  That'd be funny.  Yeah.  Just her ass at the craps table.  Who's Rich Voss?  From two ways.  And I turned around and I just kind of looked at him and I turned to my friends and we were  all hysterical.  But as soon as I turned around and looked at him like, what the hell are you doing?  He backed up and went away.  But I think by that time I was a little hard to the whole situation. 
[00:33:00]  You know, I saw some guy ask me for directions.  I looked in.  He's got his dick out.  I teach in a high school.  I had another kid like expose himself to me and I, you know.  So like I said.  Wow.  You're like a dick magnet.  Guys just love pulling their dick out in front of you.  It must be a good looking broad.  I remember one time I was cruising hookers and the car in front of me, I guess this  was when it would be all over the tent by the head station and fucking.  Like we're all supposed to go.  Oh yeah.  Yeah.  Of course. 
[00:33:30]  It's on 10th and the forties.  You'd circle around 10th, 11th and the forties.  And this one hooker was yelling, he had his dick out.  Even the hooker was bothered by some guy in the car in front of me.  Ridiculous.  Ridiculous.  I think just about all women are bothered by it.  No, Sue, you weren't bothered by it, right?  Well, a little bit, but by the time.  A little bit.  So another win for me.  I don't think that's quite a win.  No, no.  I didn't want it.  It just was like, by the time they got in Atlantic City, did it.  It happened to me so many times. 
[00:34:00]  I was just like, what is wrong with you?  I mean, it was a crowded table.  Right in the casino.  Right in the casino.  I mean, it was through the pants, but it was definitely delicious.  Definitely.  Deliberate.  Did any of these incidences get you a little moist in the panties?  No, not at all.  A little bit, yeah.  Did you show us a sack of chips in his pants or something?  A sack of chips, I guess.  She said no, which means yes.  We all know that, guys.  No means yes.  It's in the rape book.  Yeah, I don't know what this rape book is that you're reading. 
[00:34:30]  You know what?  And the thing that Jess said is totally something you say to the mentally handicapped.  Like, I've worked with autistic kids, and when they start, like, humping stuff or whatever,  you're like...  Jesus, you're just...  They just start humping things?  Jesus.  She just goes through her day getting humped wherever she goes.  Wow.  Victim, you're on the air.  Really.  Take it easy, guys.  All right.  I guess it happens a lot.  Mm-hmm. 
[00:35:00]  I mean, what are you going to do?  Got a girlfriend.  Tom has a girlfriend here that was felt up at a concert.  Want to guess the concert?  ECW.  Huh?  ECW.  I'm going to go Jay-Z.  Jay-Z.  Tom, Long Island.  Hey, how you doing?  What's up, man?  Morning, boys.  It was a Triumph concert way back...  Triumph.  You were way off.  Triumph.  The Insult Dog?  Blue Winter Golf opened up.  All right.  B-O-Z.  And Triumph.  And Triumph.  No, it was Foghat. 
[00:35:30]  What was their big song?  Magic Power?  Foghat.  Yeah.  Magic Power.  I don't know that.  Lay it on the line.  I know a little bit about this Triumph.  There you go.  They had some...  The DJ ones.  That's about it, though.  I don't think I know any more Triumph songs.  Well, good for you.  Well, we were walking down to our seats, and she was behind me, and all of a sudden, all  of a sudden, he was yelling and shit, and she was screaming.  I'm like, what the fuck?  So I turned around, and she's like, he just put his hand up my clutch!  From behind.  So he reached behind, grabbed the pussy, and pulled back. 
[00:36:00]  And she was laying into this motherfucker, and she was screaming and screaming and screaming,  and she was like, oh my god, I can't believe you motherfucker just grabbed me!  That's how TSA people frisky now, too.  They just grab the pussy.  Yeah, that's what I said.  Give him a little jiggle.  That's what I said.  It's like Getaway Day or whatever.  What is it called?  Getaway Day, yes.  It's Fondle Day.  A lot of guys are going to be fondled at the airports today.  It's Get Away With It Day.  It's one day you can actually get away with fondling women. 
[00:36:30]  See?  I think it's only TSA employees, though.  I don't think it's for people on trains.  Really?  I don't think, yeah.  But they're getting away, too.  It happens.  And, by the way, we should self-police.  We should self-police.  They say if you see something suspicious, say it.  See something, say something.  See something, say something.  So, if you just grab, you know, anonymously, no profiling, just grab some pussy.  Check for firearms.  And see if there's some kind of a bomb in there.  If you're on a train, you're actually helping everyone on the train. 
[00:37:00]  Except for that one woman.  Well, some sacrifices must be made.  I guess so.  And now she's a big YouTube star.  A big star.  So, she absolutely enjoyed the penis out on the train yesterday.  I still don't think she enjoyed it.  All right.  Listen.  Rat Spit from PalTalk.  He's out of Vegas.  He writes, Opie, the guy on the train was just trying to control the boner.  And now.  And now, the Opie and Anthony Show.  On the pirate.  Mysterious XM.  XM. 
[00:37:30]  Rock.  Something's at the edge of your mind.  Something's at the edge of your mind.  You don't know what it is.  Something you were hoping to find.  Yeah.  Would you leave this on?  It comes on the radio.  You leaving it on?  And you hear the music.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think I am, actually.  But you make sure the windows are rolled up. 
[00:38:00]  Get it over with.  Call me a faggot.  Faggot!  Faggot!  You wanna hear it?  I want.  I'm free.  Are ya?  We come through magic.  I will run.  Now we just look like idiots.  We gotta get to the point where it starts rocking.  Yeah, yeah.  When does it rock?  Then we won't look as much like sissies.  Here we go.  Hold on. 
[00:38:30]  Get ready to rock.  Hold on.  Here it comes.  Oh.  They got the little hi-hat going.  Hi-hat means it's gonna start rocking any second now.  It's your A to Z weekend.  We're in the T's.  Oh, God.  Come on.  When does it rock?  I think he's gotta babble a little more in this gay high voice.  And then it rocks.  The drums kick in. 
[00:39:00]  Every long day.  Got the synthesizer going.  This is almost like a, uh, now it's starting to rock.  This is rocking, right?  Oh, but then he kicks in with the chorus and it's like ultimate rock.  Here it comes now.  The rocket is part of the song right now.  Everybody, rock!  Yeah! 
[00:39:30]  Yeah, we're rocking!  Holy shit, we got our chicks in each other's asses!  We're so gay!  This sounds Canadian.  It really does.  Can you just turn it up any louder, please?  Yeah!  Woo!  Ugh.  God damn.  You like that song, Jimmy?  Yeah, it's got me going.  Where's Triumph from? 
[00:40:00]  Is it a Canadian band?  Are they Canucks?  They have to be Canucks.  Are they Canucks?  It's, uh, people saying Cananida.  Yeah, they're another Canadian band.  Cananida-dian.  They had a little success in America.  Are they still doing it, you think?  Oh, I'm sure they're still fucking out there.  The Doobies were on TV yesterday with their very dyed hair.  They're still doing it.  Yeah.  Is Triumph still doing it?  I bet Triumph is still out there.  You think?  You think his voice held up?  At least the one got no way.  He can't sing like that?  Right, and I was like, I'm young, I'm wild, and I'm free. 
[00:40:30]  Can I get one of those?  Thank you.  Coffee.  I'm blocking someone on Twitter.  It is fun to do.  Oh, are you?  I haven't really had enough of this fucking, this fruit in his beard.  Oh, Travis?  See, because he's gay and he's married because he doesn't want to seem gay?  It feels wonderful.  I don't think you should block anyone.  I don't block people for one. 
[00:41:00]  Like, if they just joke with me or something, I do the same thing I do.  I read a couple of things, and I see, and this guy wrote me one, he goes,  because I was complaining about fucking baby Americans sniveling about the pat-downs.  Yes.  And this guy wrote, you know, with government, you can only have safety or freedom, not both.  The ones who want safety are the babies.  You can't have both, dummy.  No, not with this government, you can't. 
[00:41:30]  It just doesn't happen.  You don't know.  You didn't serve.  I was a Navy SEAL, a former governor, a fighter.  It's amazing what dummies people are.  By the way, I heard one of the best things that sums this up.  Ask anyone, obviously you can't because they're dead,  but do you think everybody, every single person, knowing what was going to happen to them on all the flights on September 11th, 
[00:42:00]  do you think one person would have complained about the security that's in place right now if it would have kept them from flying into a building?  One person.  You just stacked the deck, though.  I mean, come on.  Dude, but come on.  You stacked the deck.  Of course I did.  But it was a great little statement.  It's like, of course they would be like, yes, do that.  Search me.  I don't care.  I don't want to go into a building.  Why are we worried about pat-downs when there's a huge war about to begin that could affect all of us? 
[00:42:30]  Radio war?  Who is it?  Fuck the radio wars.  I'm tired.  Let's get them.  I'm tired at this point.  Fuck them.  Fuck radio and fuck radio wars.  Fuck them.  Fuck them all.  I'm talking about Korea.  Korea.  That shit is about to explode.  North Korea is best Korea.  You think they're going to be able to control that situation?  Or is that fucking, is the ball rolling?  The ball's rolled further than it's rolled in the past, but again, Korea is a dumb fucking country, both of them, north and south. 
[00:43:00]  Very stupid.  North, a little stupider.  And they pull these shenanigans just so they can get concessions.  They get money.  They get all kinds of things.  This one seems a little different.  I understand what you're saying.  Yeah, yeah.  That's how it's worked out in the past.  They want attention.  This one's a little uglier than usual.  They want attention because they want, they love this six country fucking little summits that happen where they discuss what's going to, you know, become of North Korea, how we're going to help them.  And then they say, all right, we'll stop doing that. 
[00:43:30]  Just give us money.  I say we just call their bluff and say, do what you want with South Korea.  Right, right.  Go ahead.  I don't care what they do.  Obama said we're going to stand shoulder to shoulder with South Korea.  Of course we are.  It's what we do.  We're the cock block of the world.  That's our ally.  If it's not Iraq or I've got, it's someone, we just cock block everybody with our fucking stupid Uncle Sam face.  You know what it is?  Mind our business.  Get that fucking faggot white beard out of everybody's business. 
[00:44:00]  I call him Uncle Sap.  My dad would do that when he'd get mad.  Of course he would.  I couldn't stop thinking of that the other day.  And China's not going to jump in now anymore.  I don't know for sure, though.  Because they're so busy making money, hand over fist, selling rubber dog shit around the world.  People love it.  They're making money.  China is making fuck loads of money by not being communist.  The only thing communist about China these days is they oppress the fuck out of their people.  That's it.  Everything else is pure capitalism. 
[00:44:30]  They love making money.  They love building shit.  They love buying shit in other countries.  And they're not going to risk that by defending this kooky fucking nation that's been in the stone age.  They haven't moved out of 1950.  They haven't moved out of the 50s.  They can't afford to feed their own people.  And now they're going to launch some artillery shells into South Korea.  Who's going to back them up? 
[00:45:00]  Whose move is it now?  South Korea's move, and a lot of people are just speculating that they're not going to do anything.  What do you think?  They're going to just move a pawn, or are they going to do some shit?  They're not going to do anything.  Are they going to fucking move out their horse, or what?  They're going to sit.  It's a chess match, right?  What I've heard is it's a waiting game.  They've been waiting for North Korea to just fold.  They've got a change in leadership going on over there now.  So I guess the new guy's got to come in and seem like he's strong.  Right.  You feeling strong? 
[00:45:30]  Look, you feeling strong?  Look at these guys just standing there, and a shell just explodes.  They heard that fucker coming.  Oh, shit.  Oh, get out the way.  Oh, shit.  That guy's running toward it.  What an idiot, dumb Korean guy.  Well, you don't know where to run.  Oh, but they're running.  You just hear that whistle, and you don't know where to run.  This is my favorite.  This guy's my favorite.  He thinks that hiding behind some little brick pillar, that's going to save his life from an artillery shell.  Oh, shit. 
[00:46:00]  Yeah, they really fucking shelled the shit out of this little island, killed a couple of Marines, a couple of Korean Marines.  Not American.  Those are more important.  Let's say hi to...  We're always very important about Americans dying all over the place.  Yeah, we'll see what happens, but South Korea's not playing.  No!  And it always starts with two civilians dying, and then all of a sudden it's a world war.  I think it's just like...  I don't see anything happen.  I would like to see some what I like to call strategic strikes. 
[00:46:30]  Because those are fun.  I like sanctions.  Oh, the sanctions blow, though.  I love sanctions.  They don't do anything.  We're going to sanction them.  Because then that's when North Korea gets all feisty, and then they pull the sanctions back and give them concessions.  Right.  And then they go, okay, we'll be cool.  And they're cool for like a year or two.  And then they're up to shenanigans when they run out of money again.  It's like their way to take money out of the world.  I understand that.  They suck.  I'd follow the shit, but it just seems a little different this time.  That's all.  Well, they went a little further than they've gone since the armistice. 
[00:47:00]  They've never fired artillery shells into South Korea.  There's been like a couple of shootings.  Like a rifleman or something will be up there and go, yeah, let me take a pot shot at one of these guys.  But this is a huge escalation.  But I can't see the rest of the world getting involved if they do decide to just go all out as far as North Korea's side goes.  South Korea, all the allies will be there and help them out.  We'll be there, of course.  But then China would have to feel like... 
[00:47:30]  China can't.  China gets nothing from South Korea anymore.  They used to...  North Korea.  North Korea.  Right.  It used to be a little commie foothold, you know.  Yeah.  And communist China didn't want any commie nation slipping.  And Soviet Union also.  But now Soviet Union's gone and China's so fucking into their cash and everything.  They can't be bothered with this fucking piece of shit country.  They're so alone right now.  They're more alone than Cuba as far as commie nations go. 
[00:48:00]  They're just stupid.  Kim Jong douche and his dumb fat son.  They're all a bunch of fat little fucking Koreans.  All that rice.  Put down the kimchi, motherfucker.  The white rice will get you every time.  Yeah.  Can't eat too much of that shit.  Just can't do it.  Good time to bring back MASH, though.  Is that what happened, like, on fucking...  Like, what did Nick at Night turn into?  MASH at Night?  No.  Yeah, yeah.  TV Land or something.  Oh, wow, wow.  Are they commemorating this whole event by just playing a MASH fucking thing? 
[00:48:30]  A MASH marathon?  I love when channels have no business getting involved in current events, but they do it  anyway because it's like, you know, hey, it's in the news.  Let's play MASH.  Let's have a MASH marathon.  And then on Veterans Day, one of the comedy channels was playing Up Periscope or whatever  one of the fucking crappy movies.  Oh, really?  They got the shitty movies.  They got a marathon of shitty military comedies.  That they bought the rights to.  Abbott and Costello joined the army.  Yeah, that's really, you know, you're really showing your respect. 
[00:49:00]  Oh, fuck.  Speaking of TV Land, last night, I saw the episode.  I'm thumbing through the guide and I see Happy Days.  And I'm like, I fucking, I hate Happy Days, but what episode is this?  Did you like it growing up?  No.  Never liked it?  I think I liked the first season when it was done on film and it was a little more edgy.  Fonzie didn't wear a leather jacket.  He was very quiet.  He wore a windbreaker.  And he was very quiet and just giving out like, you know, street wisdom to the guys 
[00:49:30]  and shit like that.  And then it just turned into a farce of the whole thing.  But last night was the episode where Sticks, the drummer, was playing the party over at  the Cunninghams and then everybody at Arnold's decided that their parents didn't let them  go because there was a Negro playing at the party.  And after Fonzie gave him all this rah-rah speech like, hey, we all got to go.  And, you know, hey, it doesn't matter, you know, black, white, whatever. 
[00:50:00]  And they're like, all right, Fonz.  And then they leave.  And one guy stands up and goes, who's not going?  And they all raised their hand.  So they play somber music at that point?  Oh, of course.  Yeah, it was the somber, happy days.  Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.  You know, it was very, very somber, happy days music.  I didn't think you had it.  I thought you were going into the Brady Bunch, you asshole.  No, it was very somber.  I thought you were doing your Brady Bunch bit.  You nailed it, though.  It's the same shit.  It's funny.  And then the Fonz couldn't believe it.  Do you have the peppy version of that offhand? 
[00:50:30]  That's when they solve whatever the fuck's happening in the episode.  The big ending.  And then Fonzie comes over.  They're over the house.  And then they find out no one's coming.  And Fonzie can't believe it.  And he goes, Mr. C has this speech with him about how Fonzie's cool.  He's the coolest guy ever.  He goes, but Fonzie, prejudice is stronger than cool. 
[00:51:00]  And Fonzie's like, stronger than cool?  Like, it was this exchange of a man speaking with a retarded kid.  Like, Fonzie's like, whoa.  Hey, what, what?  I'm going down there, and I'm telling them, and Arnold's to come to the party.  And Mr. C had to tell him, look, it ain't going to work.  So they just had a small little gathering of just the family and the Negroes playing together. 
[00:51:30]  And they called him Colored.  And they sit there, and they have him play the drums?  Yeah, he played the drums.  And then Mr. C yelled at him, faster, boy!  Get him out of my house.  Can they murinate in the bushes outside?  Wouldn't let him use the laboratory?  That's fine.  And could you leave through the back door?  Was that the only episode featuring Styx?  No, he was in a couple of them.  They didn't use Styx a lot.  Not a lot.  Whenever they wanted to make a statement.  I want to hear that audio now.  It was so doujee.  And then Styx raped Joanie, so it turned out everybody was right. 
[00:52:00]  He raped Shortcake in the guest bedroom.  The shitter.  Yeah, he put a drumstick over her neck so she couldn't scream.  Gave her a good fucking savaging.  Styx brought a chick with him, too.  Oh, right.  So there were two colored people.  Probably Jenny Piccolo, because she loved cum of any color.  She was another colored girl.  It was Laura Bell.  Who was the one that Richie wound up dating?  A colored girl?  Oh, the one he married. 
[00:52:30]  Fuck yeah, I don't know.  He was 50 in season three.  Oh, God.  Where he had the fucking ridiculous comb-over going.  He had one of those TV comb-overs where they, I guess the people in hair and makeup just  spray it down and twirl it and spray it so you can't tell.  But then like a year later, you go like, how did he lose all his hair in a year?  That was the same thing with Meathead in All the Family.  Right.  He like had, his part was like right over his ear. 
[00:53:00]  Started looking like cotton candy.  Yeah, yeah.  Really bad.  And then like the show ends, you see him a year later talking about directing and it's  just chrome.  Oh, chrome dome.  Is this Fonzie's new friend it's called?  Fonzie's new friend.  Styx.  Styx.  E.  E.  Yeah, it's.  They're at the, at Arnold's.  Yeah.  And you know, Fonzie thought he could talk words of wisdom and get over racism with his  coolness. 
[00:53:30]  You see?  But his coolness didn't work.  Racism is cool.  He missed out.  He didn't realize.  And you know, what greaser in the 50s is really going to speak out against prejudice and racism?  Come on.  Like I'm trying to make Happy Days like it should be real.  It should just be dummies beating them.  Mr. C should have been beating his wife in the face for burning dinner.  Fucking from, with, with, with, like a wrench from the hardware store.  Cunningham's hardware comes home with a fucking monkey wrench and just blasts her in the 
[00:54:00]  face.  Yeah.  And makes a joke about the wrench's name and the drummer.  You, uh, you forgot about your, uh.  It was very racist back then.  Very.  You forgot about your Justin Bieber.  I know you're into the Happy Days thing, but you.  That's another thing.  You came in here all excited to talk about your, your new obsession, Justin Bieber.  Full of, full of piss and vinegar.  You're loving the Bieber, huh?  Oh, yeah.  I am digging the Bieber.  And that's why I realize he's got the, uh, number one video on YouTube. 
[00:54:30]  He sure does.  Does he really?  With, uh.  Of all time, right?  Yeah, yeah.  He, he passed by, uh, he blew right past, uh, Charlie Bit My Finger.  And he blew past, uh, Lady Gaga.  What about the evolution of dance?  That guy's gone.  Done, huh?  He's done.  He's done.  Yeah, this is, there's a new thing happening.  It's all about music videos as the top videos on YouTube.  And now.  Because people are using them as their, as their, uh, their record player.  Like they just put on the computer and.  Yeah, and play it every, every morning.  I understand why they would do that.  I think they like, uh, you know, uh, these little fucking girls like looking at the Biebs. 
[00:55:00]  Are they probably, the same girls are watching the video probably 20 times.  That's what I'm saying.  Yeah.  At least.  Hundreds probably.  Here's, here, here's what just got me.  By the, by the.  I go.  I, I, I, I go.  This is the number one video.  I gotta watch this.  I just gotta see what the fuck this is about.  I've seen like quick clips of the dumb Bieber on TV and, and shit like that.  But I'm like, let me see this video.  Did you want to have, did you have an open mind?  Go, all right. 
[00:55:30]  You ever have an open mind and go, all right, what is this whole thing about?  I didn't.  I knew I wasn't going to like it.  Because the world hates Justin Bieber.  Well, uh, the guy's fucking like the number one motherfucker.  He just won a shit load of awards.  All right, maybe not the whole world.  He just won a shit load of awards.  But I didn't go into it with an open mind, like I might like this.  I know I wasn't going to like it.  No, open mind, like what is this whole Bieber sensation?  Yeah, yeah.  Let me see what this is all about.  Is he like a, a, a, a talented, like when Michael Jackson was his age, that's a talented  young motherfucker.  Michael Jackson.  You want to say Negro. 
[00:56:00]  He was able to sing, uh, you wanted to say talented colored boy.  He was able to sing and dance.  Wonderful.  Uh, and then I was looking at him in this video and I kind of equate him to like a Donny  Osmond thing, the hair, the fucking, uh, you know, boyish looks.  And, uh, but even Donny Osmond had like a voice.  His songs were very popular, poppy and everything like that.  But this Bieber has to be the, the, the most untalented popular thing that has ever existed. 
[00:56:30]  We see the video.  He is a horrible singer.  He, he can't sing.  It's terrible.  He's very good.  Oh, stop it.  Uncle Paul.  He's very talented.  You just like his hair.  Just love his hair.  He likes his hair must.  His hair.  It's a baby.  I think is the one.  Yeah.  You smile at the bowling alley.  It's not this one.  Know your Bieber, Dan.  Sorry.  Know your Bieber.  And then, uh, he's, he, there's like, he's hanging out with a bunch of black guys and 
[00:57:00]  Hispanic guys in this video, which is, it just wouldn't happen.  He's trying to like have it rub off, I guess, so he could get some, some rhythm so he could  dance, which he can't do.  And then he's trying to pick up on these girls that are a little too old for him.  They're young girls, but they're a little too old for him.  Like, you know, the Bieber girls are all like nine, 10, 11 year old girls with the posters  all over their room.  There's no 16 year old girls that are dying over Bieber without being the school fucking 
[00:57:30]  retards that get smacked around by the cool girls.  There's no what?  What?  How old?  Oh, like, uh, 16.  Boom!  And then like, he's trying to go after this Hispanic girl.  Like he's cool.  Auto-tuned up the ass.  And then other people are dancing and he's trying to dance and he's so spastic.  He's very cool.  Look, the Hispanic girl and the black girls and, and his black friend. 
[00:58:00]  Not, not really black though.  Safe black.  Yeah.  They go with safe black in videos.  That, that, that shade of black that white people are comfortable with.  Yeah, they are, they're not exactly doing a drive-by, they're bowling.  They're bowling, yeah.  And look, he's dragging this girl over who's way out of his league.  And now what's he trying to be like cute?  And this chick's just like, I hate Justin Bieber. 
[00:58:30]  This kid's fucking, look, what's he going to do?  Kiss her.  Kiss her?  You don't think he has game to pick up the Spanish broad?  No fucking way!  You gotta have special skills to pick up a Spanish broad.  He's doing nothing.  He's showing it.  And look at him trying to dance.  He's like, you can't dance.  This kid is a pussy magnet.  Why though?  Like, what is this all about?  He's a handsome young kid.  If you're a 12 year old chick, this is great.  But that's exactly what I'm saying.  I don't want to admit that we're too old to understand the Bieber. 
[00:59:00]  This doesn't, I don't get, I don't get why this is so huge.  It's a teen idol thing that's going on.  But they're overplaying the fact that they think it's a shitload of these girls.  Like, those girls would not be into Justin Bieber.  They're the ones taking pictures in the mirror in the bathroom that I see on Twitter.  How old is he though?  I don't know.  He's like 10.  This breakdancing video has everything.  I know, it really does.  Let me tell you something, Bubby.  The girls go wild for this kid.  I don't know how old he is, but they're putting the bumpers up when he's bowling. 
[00:59:30]  That's not a good sign.  Look, look, they show like these quick clips and doing these, that are supposed to be dance moves, but he's terrible.  This kid's good.  And then they got like black guys dancing and they're dancing.  Ah, shit.  Is that motherfucking Ludacris?  I like the Ludacris.  I like the Ludacris.  I didn't until we interviewed him. 
[01:00:00]  Did we interview him?  I forgot already.  It was awful.  Yeah, he wasn't, uh...  Oh, yeah.  He wasn't cool.  What the fuck is going on?  This is...  How do you have any cred?  You don't need cred because it's not being marketed to the people who give a fuck about that.  Is that it?  Yeah.  Dude, Ludacris is smart.  He's smarter than us.  I wish this kid loved Opie and Anthony. 
[01:00:30]  He would have put us on the biggest YouTube video of all time.  We would have just been the tough guys in the bowling alley.  The ruffians.  Get out of here, you kids.  Roughing everybody up.  He's trying to moonwalk.  They showed a half a slide of his foot.  He's not good.  Over 200 million views.  390.  It's almost 400 million views.  Look at this now.  He's nuzzling up.  It looks like kiddie porn. 
[01:01:00]  I don't understand.  Uncle Paul.  Oh, come on.  He looks wimpy and nerdy.  Of course he does.  But they're making him look like he's some kind of sex symbol for that demo.  Now, look, he's walking out hand in hand with the Puerto Rican girl.  And I'll bet you she gets recognized from this video more than I have after 20 years of stand-up.  Of course.  Yeah, that's the shame of it all.  Baby, babe, it's a nice song.  I'm going out on a limb here.  Uh-oh.  Justin Bieber, a bigger catastrophe to the world than the Korean situation right now.  Right now, worse than Korea. 
[01:01:30]  Showing South Korea.  It's Justin Bieber.  Why aren't the politicians dressing Justin Bieber?  Jesus, he has 100 million, 100 million of his videos.  It's ridiculous.  He's a teen idol, though.  He's bad.  No teen idol.  But he's not good.  No teen idol has ever had this kind of computer access, like, where we could track.  Like, you know.  What about Leif Garrett?  I bet you he would have gotten massive views like this and Elvis.  But there was no way to just see exactly how many people had watched or listened at any given moment. 
[01:02:00]  Elvis would have done this in the fucking, if there was computers in everybody's houses.  Yeah.  YouTube of him, his last dump.  Oh, God, yeah.  When he fell out, it was like a manse cattail.  Can you imagine the drunken Twitters from Elvis?  Yeah, you know, you don't think of that.  That would rule.  Oh, here we go.  Man, you know, pretty hammered.  I'm taking a dump and eating some banana peanut butter sandwiches.  I'm quitting karate.  Priscilla's been fucking that.  I ran out of characters.  But he's able to type in, ran out of characters? 
[01:02:30]  No, but he's saying that to himself.  Oh, he's saying that to the colonel.  Yeah.  The colonel's soaking me dry.  He's an asshole.  I'm telling you.  Baby, baby, baby.  I wanted to be with you, but that fucking song was a little catchy.  It was a little catchy.  Jimmy, was it catchy?  It was.  It was a little catchy.  I would dance to it like this.  You can't see it on the radio, but I would just look left and right like, baby, baby.  Were you doing that?  I was like that.  Were you just turning your head? 
[01:03:00]  Yeah.  I want to be the older guy in the club dancing to this.  Oh, no, you don't.  Yes, I do.  No, no, you don't.  Yes, I do.  I'm very good.  Are you very good?  You're probably better than him.  My girlfriend gets so uncomfortable when I dance over her.  Like, when I put my arms over her like that.  She fucking hates it.  She's like, all right, you got to stop.  I'm uncomfortable.  You can just stop at your girlfriend gets very uncomfortable.  Yeah.  She hates that.  Period.  That's it.  Awards the other night.  Yeah, for what?  Fucking auto-tune?  I don't know, but he thanked everybody.  For what?  Here's him thanking everybody. 
[01:03:30]  The American Music Award goes to...  Artist of the Year.  Justin Bieber.  Yay.  Yay.  Yay.  All right, all right.  Wow.  This means...  I don't know.  I don't know what else to say.  Nothing.  Please.  My fans are amazing.  I want to thank my label. 
[01:04:00]  I want to thank L.A. Reid, Steve Bartles.  I want to thank Chris Hicks.  I want to thank...  Hold on.  Is he trying to sound ghetto?  Yeah, he ghettos it up.  He says, I want to thank my label.  He said, like...  No, he ghettos it up.  That's what I don't understand.  What the fuck is that?  He's too nerdy and wimpy to pull that off, but he's pulling it off.  I don't know where he's from.  Where's he from?  He's from Ontario.  He's Canadian.  I don't thank my libel.  He's...  Yo.  He's from Canada?  This kid's bad, dude.  We can't acknowledge anyone from Canada.  These Canadians are taking over.  They're crazy. 
[01:04:30]  First triumph and now Justin Bieber.  I know.  The world's coming to...  All in 30 years.  We better bomb those fuckers and calm them down a little bit.  Let's just send some fucking artillery shells.  They've given us too much in the last few decades.  People don't seem to care if you do that.  What else have they given us?  Exactly.  Oh, God.  I want to thank everybody.  My mom for giving up so much for me.  My family.  My dad.  But, you know...  Wait, wait.  What?  What?  Now, I'm a father.  Did he just thank his dad for giving up everything? 
[01:05:00]  I think the mom got thanked for giving up so much for him.  Yeah, for sacrificing.  Vaginal elasticity?  Because, apparently, they're making money hand over fist.  Every father dreams of giving birth to a fucking pop star.  To a money machine.  Yes!  What the fuck did the parents give up?  Every time I come, I'm wiping up saying that could have been a Bieber.  Wait, I've got to hear that again.  You said that tastes like a Bieber.  See, because the cum's in your mouth.  Oh.  No, I'm kidding, Jimmy. 
[01:05:30]  You know who's sacrificing?  Who?  Blind Stevie's mom.  Oh, my God, yes.  But not Justin Bieber's mom.  What the fuck did she sacrifice?  She knew she had a gold mine as soon as this kid was crawling.  Much for me, my family, my dad.  But, you know...  Wait, I've got to hear that.  Where was the sacrifice part?  Hold on one second.  Sorry.  Sorry.  God.  I want to thank Chris Hicks.  I want to thank everybody. 
[01:06:00]  My mom for giving up so much for me.  My family.  My dad.  But, you know...  Giving up what?  But, you know...  He's only...  Time, dude.  You know, man.  She had him when she was 18, huh?  Did she?  She fucking gave birth to a fucking ATM machine at 18.  18?  A single mom.  So she's, what, 32?  How old is this kid?  13.  I can't even tell.  Oh, yeah, he's...  Can I say this, by the way?  At least he's thanking his parents.  And she's still young enough to have kids. 
[01:06:30]  We used to keep pumping them out.  You don't know what you got now.  Exactly.  You got a gold mine in there.  Just keep pumping them out.  Yeah.  She was the one who originally uploaded his videos to YouTube, where he was found.  Oh, really?  So she's kind of responsible.  Yeah.  I mean, at least he's thanking his parents.  I like that.  I like when artists think they're parents and don't act like total douchebags.  I really got this opportunity really about a year and a half ago and really was embraced  by a man named Usher Raymond. 
[01:07:00]  You might know him.  You might know him.  I don't know, but I feel like he's had such an amazing career and it would be only right  if I invited him up here to share it with me.  They make out.  Not only my mentor, but my best friend and my big brother.  What a coincidence.  In five years with you, Usher in a movie theater.  Did you hear that?  Yeah.  I love you, man.  He's got a big brother.  I need to know what the brother's up to. 
[01:07:30]  Big brother.  No, that was Usher.  You sure?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Usher.  It seems he doesn't really like white people.  Am I getting that from Bieber?  From the Biebs?  What did the white world ever give him?  I don't see what.  What?  White world gave him nothing.  The black world discovered him.  Really?  Usher discovered him.  How about the droves of fucking young white girls that are just buying all of his shit?  You think sisters are fucking going for this guy? 
[01:08:00]  They're trying to give him this image as a kind of a hip fits in with the black community  thing?  Young rough and tumble.  Stop it.  A young rough and tumble boy.  Oh, God.  It ain't working.  Sorry.  I mean, it's working, obviously.  He also thanked Chris Hicks in there from Ron and Fez.  Oh, did he?  That's nice.  So why is Chris Hicks working for Ron and Fez?  I have no idea.  Why couldn't one little fucking piece of shit like this be a fan?  Why couldn't one little shit like this be a fan of this shit? 
[01:08:30]  If anything.  See, look.  Somebody just wrote, remember the Jonas Brothers?  Ah.  They're doing all right.  Are they?  Are they doing as good as they were at the pinnacle of their fucking...  Well, you can't keep up this type of success forever.  That's what I'm saying.  You think the Beeb is going to be fucking doing this?  You banked the money and then...  Remember the Umbop brothers?  You remember Umbop?  Oh, God, yeah.  Remember Umbop?  Hanson did go away.  Hanson, God.  They weren't as big as this, though.  They're still around.  Hanson was giant.  Not as big as they were, obviously.  Hanson was giant. 
[01:09:00]  They're adults now.  Yeah, now they're just big men.  The hairy men.  Remember the little one was cute because he was like four at the time?  He's playing drums.  He's playing drums.  He doesn't even know what the fuck is going on.  He was a has-been by nine.  That's it.  Jesus, what the fuck?  Hey, Akiva in New York wants in on this discussion.  Akiva.  Yeah, hey, I don't think you guys are really appreciating the lyrical abilities of Justin  Bieber here.  Yeah.  I mean, his chorus. 
[01:09:30]  I mean, baby, baby, baby.  Oh, baby.  Better get better.  Better get better.  Baby, baby, baby, oh, baby.  Yeah, man.  That's lyrically brilliant.  I mean, it's just unbelievable.  And the way I should just mention that this kid's like riding this wave of things.  Just wait for the balls drop and he loses the ability to sing.  What?  Don't look like he's able to sing.  We heard you.  Thank you, Akiva.  That's just...  Yeah, Bieber doesn't write his own shit. 
[01:10:00]  I know.  The guy was being sarcastic, though, with the lyrics.  Yeah, yeah, of course.  Baby, baby, baby, baby.  So you were watching Justin Bieber videos yesterday?  Well, one.  I watched that one.  The baby, baby, baby one.  Did you pump one out to it?  Yeah.  What else are you going to do?  You do know that fucking...  There are guys...  It wouldn't be a pedo because he's 16 now, but...  Yeah, what is it?  Pedarist?  Nah.  There's another name for it.  Would a secretor want to get his hands on him? 
[01:10:30]  Why does it have a different name for every year?  A secretor.  You think he's getting rubbed on in the subway?  Oh, sorry, man.  I mean Bieber.  Yeah, I think it's...  Yeah, I don't understand that shit either, Ant.  Yeah, I just...  There's a lot of people that are really famous, and you don't even know why.  Like, Kim Kardashian is really famous for just being really hot, I guess.  Yeah, but even that is more talent than Bieber.  What's the talent?  Being hot?  Is there a talent to being hot?  Yeah, guys like looking at it. 
[01:11:00]  You see how...  You don't watch Keeping Up with the Kardashians at all, right?  No.  She is a zilch when she's not just being hot.  That's her job, I guess.  It's just to be really hot.  And Justin Bieber's job is to be attractive to 11 and 12 year...  Like, tweens.  What happens to...  Be attractive to the tween.  What happens to a lot of these artists, too, they get in that zone where they get all  the best people helping them, you know, make hit songs.  Imagine if they took all that shit away from Bieber and said, all right, let's see how talented  you really are.  You also think...  And throw him in a studio?  A couple of years go by, and Bieber's got to start shaving and shit like that, and he can't 
[01:11:30]  have that haircut anymore, so he does something.  But you think all these guys, and his record sales like in the shitter because the tweens  look at a man now and don't like it?  Do you think all these guys, Ludacris and Usher and everything, do you think they're all  going to still be rallying around him?  Oh, hell no.  Hell no.  Toss him to the fucking waist high.  I hope the people that are working Bieber understand that, too, and bank as much money  as possible.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, the tweens, especially, they'll move on to the next thing, and that could be within 
[01:12:00]  a year.  Really?  They're very fickle, those tweens.  Justin Bieber with...  They want to see Justin Bieber with male pattern baldness.  How great would that be?  Oh, God.  Yeah, but that hair fucking...  That's what happened to Leif Garrett.  What the hairdo he has, you wouldn't be able to tell.  He's pushing everything forward and to the side already.  He's got a full head of hair, but he's doing a comb over.  Already, yeah.  What that is.  Yeah, Leif Garrett had that...  Why did you say Leif?  Leif?  I said Leif forever. 
[01:12:30]  I think it's Leif.  Is it really Leif?  It's Leif.  Potato, potato.  Tomato, tomato.  Shit, shite.  He had the long, blonde, feathered Farrah Fawcett hair in the 70s, and then it just went  away.  My favorite Leif Garrett story.  What was it, VH1?  Where he fucking paralyzed his best friend, and then they met for the first time.  Oh, yeah.  They brought him together to meet again.  Oh.  And then the asshole in the wheelchair forgives Leif Garrett.  How did he paralyze him? 
[01:13:00]  They had a massive car accident.  Car crash.  He was all fucked up.  Something over a cliff, or I don't know.  I forget exactly, but then they had the big meeting for the first time, and there's  this kid.  I mean, he's not a kid anymore in a wheelchair.  And then this guy forgives Leif Garrett.  Fuck that forgiveness shit.  What's that about?  That's Justin Bieber, right there.  You're looking at fucking Justin Bieber.  He just popped up a picture of Leif Garrett circa 1970-something.  Yeah.  And it's the Bieber.  That's it.  Yeah, there were a bunch of them. 
[01:13:30]  Oh, wait, wait, wait.  Oh, fuck yeah.  I know what I saw.  All right.  Now, she is not the flasher.  She's yelling at somebody.  All right.  She's yelling at the flasher.  Thank you.  And supposedly speaking up made a difference.  Police arrested Mario Valdiva.  He's 51 years old from Queens.  They charged him with public lewdness and sex abuse.  Well, somebody else was videotaping her while she let him have it.  What do you think?  I did the right thing. 
[01:14:00]  Okay.  Right.  All right.  So let's talk Mike Woods right now.  Do you understand the news gets petrified at stories like that?  They just looked at each other dumbfounded.  Dumbfounded how to get out of that story without saying something that they'd have to apologize  for in the next segment.  Looks like that guy read the rape book.  Yeah.  He knows what's up.  He knows.  But he has to play it another way on TV.  They both turned to each other because he goes, looks like she let him have it.  And then the guy was like, I can make a let her have it joke.  Like in his eyes.  I can't say anything. 
[01:14:30]  Yeah.  I could be fired at any moment.  God damn.  Great.  Do you know I've never seen the evolution of dance?  Really?  No.  I'm looking at it now.  I don't understand why that did as well as it did.  Oh, you don't like those?  Two M&M's in the top ten though.  It's all about music now.  What's Peanut?  M&M's.  Oh, boy.  I was going to say pistachios.  That's a good one. 
[01:15:00]  Peanuts.  Uh, Bieber was on BET last night.  Of course he was.  Huh.  What's that?  Eh.  Bieber enjoys testicles.  Get it?  I got it.  He just, uh, wow, he's really embracing the, uh, R&B community.  I like to call it.  Mm-hmm.  Yes.  Yes.  All right.  We got a busy show today.  Uh.  Do we?  What do we got going on?  Why are we here? 
[01:15:30]  We got a busy show, uh, yesterday even.  Very philosophical of you.  Why are we here?  Oh.  Oh, you're going for the big picture on that one.  Oh, it's just going for the, you know, till ten thing.  In the shithouse.  Yeah.  Let the record show that, uh.  All right.  Uh, do we have a stenographer?  The big two-page advertising for SiriusXM yesterday?  Yeah.  We're the only show that is working today.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  All those big names they decide to go with instead of us.  None of those people are working. 
[01:16:00]  That's good.  They're just taking this place's money and running.  We rule.  We're dumb.  That's why.  We're really stupid.  No, we like doing radio in the end, but I mean.  No, but.  In the end.  In the end, we just like doing radio.  All right.  Hey, uh, the boys put a big Thanksgiving thing together.  Oh.  I want to hear this.  Thanksgiving.  As we go to break.  That's a turkey.  Yes, it is.  In September of 1620, the ship Mayflower left Plymouth, England, bound for America, with  102 passengers on board, seeking religious freedom. 
[01:16:30]  It was a long journey, lasting 66 days.  Yay!  Yay!  Oh, we're finally here.  All right, people.  We finally made it.  I told you we'd make it.  Oh, my God.  Sorry, Pat.  It's just the enthusiasm of the thing.  It gets great.  However, due to the incompetence of their retarded captain, they landed 100 miles off  course from their original destination on the Hudson River.  Hey!  Where the heck are we?  This doesn't look like New Jersey.  Cut me some slack, okay?  You stupid asshole. 
[01:17:00]  You and your little dick dragged our asses across the ocean, and now you don't know where  we are?  You guys have been making fun of me and my small to 4P and it's the entire trip.  You're goddamn right.  Upset at the captain's irrational piloting, the crew of the Mayflower threw him overboard.  Where he then drowned.  Throw him overboard!  But I can't swim!  Now I'm gonna die a virgin!  The harsh New England winter quickly approached, and the settlers soon took shelter inside the  vessel, suffering from disease, and scurvy only half survived. 
[01:17:30]  Ugh!  Scurvy is so 1590.  I thought when the captain said we were bringing fruits, he met some limes, not you.  Come on, let's cuddle up and stay warm, pilgrim.  Spring couldn't come fast enough, and the remaining survivors finally ventured outside  their ship.  How?  Yeah, how?  Just like my partner Kinney said.  To their surprise, they were greeted by a welcome party of English-speaking Indians.  How wonderful!  English-speaking savages!  This must be God's will. 
[01:18:00]  I learned English when some asshole Europeans came over here and sold me into slavery.  And what about the rest of your tribe?  Do the other barbarians also speak English?  Most of them are dead from some damn disease.  The British probably over here with them.  Oh my, that's horrible.  Yeah, but that's all water under the bridge now.  The two parties put their differences behind them, and the local Indians soon began teaching  the pilgrims the skills they would need to survive in the new world. 
[01:18:30]  All right, now watch closely.  This is how the Indians taught me how to plant corn.  I must admit, when you said you were going into the fields to bury something, I had other  things in mind.  If you were an Indian, they'd give you the name Speaks with Genitals and Mouth.  As spring turned to summer, the new settlers began reaping the rewards of their new friendship.  Yay!  Look at all this corn!  Wow!  Whee!  And soon they decided to hold a celebration in honor of their bounty and new friends.  You know what's a good idea here, buddy?  We should throw a party.  Oh, count me in. 
[01:19:00]  I'm on decorations.  Oh, what a wonderful idea!  Okay, if you guys say so.  The feast lasted three whole days, and the two parties involved agreed to make it an annual  event.  This is so much fun.  We should really do this again.  Yeah, hopefully we'll all be around for it.  There are no guarantees, you know.  The two societies soon signed a treaty, one that lasted 50 years, until more Europeans  arrived with more diseases and killed off the remaining Indian tribesmen, as was now known 
[01:19:30]  as Plymouth Rock.  The virus, Sirius XM.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Bicycle!  Bicycle!  Bicycle!  Bicycle!  Bicycle!  Bicycle!  I want to ride my bicycle!  Bicycle!  Bicycle!  I want to ride my bicycle!  I want to do it without the seat!  See, get it?  Bicycle!  Bicycle!  Freddie Mercury stopped riding his bike 19 years ago today.  Wait, wait.  Are you kidding? 
[01:20:00]  19 years ago today, Freddie Mercury wasn't riding any more bicycles.  He died 19 years ago.  Yeah.  Holy shit.  And he used to ride the bicycles without the seat.  Yeah.  Replay.  He was only 45.  That's it, huh?  He was only 45 at the time.  So he would have been 64 years young.  Well, no, let's not get ahead of ourselves.  He'd have gotten AIDS 20 more times. 
[01:20:30]  Let's be real.  You think he wouldn't have learned his lesson?  I think he loved the cock.  Loved the cock.  He would have been one of those guys that gets a little scared and says, you know what?  Okay.  Yeah.  Woo.  I better, you know, be safe now.  My lifestyle is a little out ahead.  He wouldn't have been one of those guys.  Bear back and 15 at a clip at the bathhouse.  Hell yeah.  Like I said, he would have gotten it 20 more times.  That would have been it.  And Lee Harvey Oswald killed 47 years ago today. 
[01:21:00]  Wow.  Yeah.  That's...  You know that JFK Jr. would have been 50 this year?  Really?  Yeah.  Because I think they're rerunning an Oprah interview.  Oh, God.  I think Oprah's on a lot in my house because I know what Oprah's up to.  You certainly know everything Oprah's doing, don't you?  And the big Lee Majors Oprah shows today.  Let's not forget.  Lee Majors and his young wife.  You know, it was a very big deal that Lee Majors was on our show because he doesn't really do anything anymore. 
[01:21:30]  Yeah.  We should have, like, farmed that out to people.  Really?  This is Lee Majors now.  Yeah.  He hasn't been seen in a really long time except for that hearing aid commercial.  No, we got video and everything, but then, you know, it takes the marketing department here at SiriusXM to realize that it might have been a big deal and to farm it out.  Ah.  What?  But why would they do that?  Exactly.  Enough of the bitchin'.  I'm sorry, people, but it's endless.  Bitchin'.  Huh?  Are they coming? 
[01:22:00]  Yes.  Where are they?  I don't know.  They went to get them.  Down the hall?  Yeah, we got...  I see Roland.  We got Rich Voss and Steve-O on their way into the studio.  Stitches.  I hate when I can't get to my taint because my jeans are too thick, so you keep pinching, but you're missing your taint.  You got to pinch and roll.  No, but you can't get to the skin.  Oh, that's the best feeling, though, when you do get it.  Oh, it's amazing.  And then you just fucking rub it out.  I kick until my shoe falls off.  Exactly.  That's my leg shake.  And that dope...  You guys are Yankees fans. 
[01:22:30]  Anthony, mostly.  Yeah.  You're Brian Cashman there is playing hardball with Derek Jeter.  Oh, certainly.  Why don't you go try to find a better deal?  This is what he's telling them.  I really, as Travis said earlier, too, I hope this just blows up in their face.  Oh, really?  Yeah, I do.  I hope that...  I...  Give the guy...  Give the guy what he deserves.  Well, that would mean acknowledging loyalty to a team.  Or a company.  To a guy that's been there during some of the greatest moments in Yankee history. 
[01:23:00]  Right.  Making part of it.  Yeah, dude.  You know, you don't treat him like some common piece of shit and then throw all kinds of money  at some new guy or, you know, just a name.  That guy's dedicated to the team itself.  He's royalty.  He's a captain.  He brings more than just being the shortstop of the Yankees.  But he's pushing it, too, because he wants four years.  Exactly.  He's pushing it a little bit, too. 
[01:23:30]  Three years, 45 million?  Whatever.  How about you take that?  Yeah, that would be nice.  The guy has done a lot for the Yankees.  And he really has.  Steve-O, you like baseball?  And Rich Voss, hi.  I'm sorry.  I didn't know I was doing sports radio.  I'm in the wrong place.  You stupid Yankees.  Nobody gives a fuck.  It's a big fucking story.  Why don't you calm down?  I didn't think you were doing fun radio.  Yeah, it's a big fucking story.  Oh, shut up.  Let's talk baseball.  Shut up, you lonely drunk.  Oh, God. 
[01:24:00]  Voss, take the mirror away from your face.  Oh, I'm rubbing your glue.  Say what I did there.  What's up with you today?  Exactly.  You know, right?  I just walk in.  I don't want to hear some dumb sports.  Oh, it's a holiday.  I forgot.  I bet it was a holiday right around the corner.  I would talk about golf.  Exactly.  It is New York, and no one really talks about the Yankees in New York.  Yeah, God forbid.  It's only on the front page of the fucking sports page.  North Korea and South Korea are almost at war.  Nobody cares.  That's on page 22.  How about we talk about that while you were probably fucking drooling in your sleep? 
[01:24:30]  And you're awake.  You took care of it.  I would have listened to you in the car if you weren't kicked off of every station.  Oh, Jesus.  I'm sorry.  He just likes...  A nice event of entertainment like you, I'm surprised we aren't on all over.  You do realize you were a part of that fucking disaster, you asshole.  He just likes Kim Jong-il because he's taller than him.  You forgot you were kind of part of the program.  I got kicked off every station.  What does that say about you?  Exactly.  You shit heaping piece of shit.  Hey, Steve-O.  How are you, buddy?  Pat from Monaki goes, here's Steve-O and Dumb-O. 
[01:25:00]  Oh, wow, right?  Yeah.  Pat from Monaki.  Really?  Yeah, he's good.  I'm quoting him.  I know.  He's a funny guy.  He's very funny, man.  I'm not mad at baseball.  I like the way New York's so fanatical about it as a city.  So go Yankees.  I think it's great.  I don't know.  There it is.  You know what?  I don't know shit about it, though.  What's the news?  You're not a sports fan, man?  Management's getting a little jumpy.  I thought it was funny when the one guy was humping Kate Hudson. 
[01:25:30]  A-ron, A-ron, A-ron.  A-ron.  That's what I know about the Yankees.  She thought she was going to be the one that turns him around.  What a dummy she was.  He's probably giving her a better fuck than that Chris Robinson.  Wasn't she banging the guy to follow Chris Robinson?  Oh, I thought A-ron was fucking Chris Robinson for a second.  If six degrees of separation applied to having sex,  God, think about how many people.  It's like everybody fucked everybody, man. 
[01:26:00]  That's pretty much the deal, yeah.  Yeah.  It's like, uh...  Why, who have you fucked that has, like, gone on and...  I was going to say Bonnie.  Who's the most...  Bonnie McFarlane.  You know, I was really, um...  I was going to, um...  Try and, like, try and leave, like, um...  My, like, name-dropping ways in the past  and try and, like, strive for more spiritual growth.  But it's just too funny.  Like, the most famous chick I had sex with  was this girl Robin from The Real World. 
[01:26:30]  I can't remember if I'm saying this, but, um...  What I was so psyched about is that I was in this hotel room  having sex with her while she was on the TV screen.  Oh, hey.  I feel like I...  There you go.  I feel like...  It must have been a real-world marathon.  What real world was she on?  You know, I think...  It was a long time.  It was the San Diego one ages and ages ago.  I think that girl's gorgeous, though, man.  I looked her up on the internet not too long ago 
[01:27:00]  and I just had to start beating off.  That's a compliment, right?  Yeah.  Years later, you're beating off to the girl  you had sex with in a hotel room?  Sure.  As opposed to what's in front of Rich.  Pictures of Leif Garrett.  I just talked to him.  Why are you attacking us today, Rich?  I just talked to him.  I just smashed myself.  Uh-huh.  I just smashed myself.  I know.  After you attacked us for a half hour.  Well, because here's the thing.  From now on, I'm going on the offensive.  Yeah, yeah.  Not the defensive anymore. 
[01:27:30]  Enough of this bullshit, okay?  Exactly.  I don't wake up early to drive in  to have this abuse, okay?  I have nice teeth now.  I'm not going to disagree with you.  All right, I lost a few pounds.  I'm not eating sugar.  I could even say it without slurping.  Ah, you didn't really say it right.  It was a little weird.  Sugar is hard to say.  It sounds like that little syrup in your mouth  as you were saying that.  I was trying to say sweetener.  Sweetener.  Yeah, that might work better.  Why don't you stop eating sugar?  What are you putting in place of sugar?  Like that aspartame fucking poison? 
[01:28:00]  Well, I always have that.  You know what I've been eating a lot of?  Cock?  Your own balls on stage?  I learned a long time ago  you never ask a question  in front of anyone in this room.  And you don't pause.  Your problem was  you don't put a semicolon after it.  No pauses and no question marks  ever on this show.  Just fill up the dead air yourself.  You know what I've been eating  and then he looks around  like no one's going to say cock  or cum.  Or cum.  Or your own balls on stage. 
[01:28:30]  Rich is a cum eater.  Fill up the dead air.  I don't have seven years of material.  Oh, see?  No, you don't even have  seven good minutes.  I knew that was cum  and his eyes opened.  Holy shit.  What are you eating?  What are you eating now  that you were saying  before we rudely interrupted?  You forgot already.  How old were you?  I don't even remember  what I said.  Of course you said.  I said things are good.  He swam once around  the goldfish bowl 
[01:29:00]  and forgot.  That looks a lot  like a lot of cum.  Why didn't you ask  for the bukkake?  Just put it on your face.  You know what?  Let's put it on Jim's chin  so he feels at home.  What's that?  Nothing.  It's just brutal in here, man.  Rich came in swinging.  Did he say what he's eating?  No, I didn't.  It just was a quick ad-lib.  I didn't know.  I'm not used to coming in here.  Do you eat a lot of carbs?  I fucking eat nothing but print.  It's hard. 
[01:29:30]  You can see that.  What's that?  Sometimes you don't even  ask a question.  Sometimes you don't even  ask a question.  Really?  Play-Doh just said  he eats a lot of carbs?  Really?  Maybe I shouldn't have  now.  I feel like it's breaking news.  Looks like someone  was doing some writing  in his hotel room  last night.  Getting all prepared  for this.  This is supposed to be  a casual, easy show  the day before Thanksgiving.  But I eat a lot of carbs  and it's hard  to not eat sugar. 
[01:30:00]  Is that what they call  themselves in the beep booths  now, carbs?  What's a beep booth?  Beeps, stupid.  Beeps.  You said a beep booth.  Beeps, stupid.  That's a garage.  A beep booth.  Oh, shit.  Wow.  So what do you have,  like sweet and low  or something?  Well, no, it's just  it's not bad.  Advertisement is bad for you.  You might as well  fucking do the sugar.  Eat cigarettes.  I mean, it's in  whole wheat bread.  It's in everything.  But if, you know,  if you don't eat muffins  and candy bars, 
[01:30:30]  you know,  were you eating all that stuff?  I eat everything  late at night.  I wake up to have cookies  or you go on the road,  you're laying in bed.  Exactly.  Well, what are you thinking?  Just say it.  It was cookies.  Cookies.  No, I didn't fuck up that one.  I said cookies.  It was a little bit of stuff.  It was a little bit of stuff?  I'm not mad at you.  Okay.  I didn't think  you were one of those  like snack kind of guys  because you've always 
[01:31:00]  kind of been thin,  you know,  you haven't been a...  I love snacks.  Really?  Oh, are you kidding me?  It covers...  Here's the way.  Food,  when you don't have  anything else,  food will fill the emptiness  if you're not buying something.  Oh, he's been sober  for a long time, Steve.  How many years?  Huh?  How many years?  I have today.  Oh, no way.  Check it out.  Look at the screen right there.  That's what they see  when you go through the airport.  Oh, I definitely 
[01:31:30]  can't go through this now.  I saw this...  I was in the airport  and like,  it says like,  there's a sign.  It said it's supposed to like,  I guess,  calm you down.  It's like,  here, don't worry.  You know,  like,  this is all they see.  You know,  the guy's dick.  Yeah, that's what I just said.  Big fucking 14-incher  hanging down.  And you gotta go through there  like, oh, great.  I gotta come in  with my pointing stick.  In the picture,  it looked just like me,  you know?  Like,  the guy's dick  looked just like mine.  Like,  it was all like,  skewed off to the left.  Like,  all like,  just crooked as shit. 
[01:32:00]  I want to get a printout.  It'll save me on an MRI.  Whoa!  Did it?  No.  I mean,  I don't.  You get a printout  of your x-ray.  For what?  See if you have a spot  or something here or there.  Oh,  like,  use it as free medical advice.  That's not a good idea.  Take your TSA scan  to the doctor  and go,  Doc,  what is this?  Can you read this?  There's a spot here.  And he'd go,  an idiot.  3D or...  What is this in my chest?  Oh,  your ticket stub.  Oh,  I forgot.  No,  baby,  I'm totally clean.  Look here. 
[01:32:30]  Yeah,  just start showing girls  your TSA thing.  Look at this.  Does this look like AIDS?  Come on.  I'm going to do the pat-down,  though.  I'm going to do that.  Yeah.  Just get ready to come.  Right when they pat me down,  just shoot a load all over.  We said it's the greatest thing.  We said you should go to the airport  with a boner.  Like a load up in Viagra.  Just go there with a boner.  Just Viagra hard on  and then just,  when he touches,  you just go,  yeah,  you touched that cock.  You touched my big,  stupid fucking cock.  I want to go through  without underwear,  though.  Like,  when they try to pat me down,  I want my fucking cock 
[01:33:00]  to flop out.  Do you want to just flop me?  Yeah, badly.  In, like,  sweatpants that just have  the flap with no button  so your dick could,  as you're walking,  just fall out?  No,  if they pat you down,  your dick couldn't drip out,  Ralph.  They grab you  and they pat you hard  and they pull down.  So I've had sweats come down  before.  Now they tell you  sometimes to hold them up,  but I kind of want them  to come down again.  I've wanted mine  to flop down my whole life.  Right into the face  of the screener.  Give me a sniff there, sir.  Yeah, 
[01:33:30]  you don't want the pants  to get hung up  on your little dick  when they're pulling them down.  Like a baby dick.  Like a little fucking peg  you hang your coat on.  That'd be very embarrassing.  You know you're going  to fluff it and everything.  You got to fluff it for this?  You got to prepare  for your pat down.  Come on, man.  No one's cocked.  There's enough times  you got to fluff.  I'm not going to pee  for like a year  so this is heavy.  Just get a fucking piss hard on?  No one's cocked  and say hard  through a TSA employee.  With those beasts.  They're all horrible looking.  Have you ever jerked off  and came before you got hard? 
[01:34:00]  Like you're semi-hard?  Yes!  Yeah, it's humiliating  because you think  you're just flopping around  like what are you doing?  I have to explain to myself  why I can't talk yourself down.  I don't know.  It never happens to me.  Dude, I've marathon jerked  and it's just my cock  refuses to budge  and literally the head  is just flopping above my head  and I'm like  this is humiliating  for everybody involved.  You're pulling the skin  over your head  like you have foreskin again.  It's just fucking  it's nothing going on. 
[01:34:30]  Dude, it's fucking  I remember one time  I was on my third load of the day  when I was living at home  many, many years ago  and I fucking  I finally came  and I looked over  and my black and white TV  it was Happy Days  and Mr. Cunningham  was on TV  I was  I was so caught up  in my  Did that distract you?  Just him talking about  his dumb hardware store?  No, it just dripped  I said this  when I was like  maybe 17 or 18  I went to this lady's house  to smoke a joint  or something  and I don't know 
[01:35:00]  what it was  a joint  hold on  there was food there  He was entertained by you  every time something  happens with your mouth  He's laughing  before the punchline  that's scary  and then  I don't know  but I went home  I was so horny  and I think  I took a hard roll  a buttered roll  and I cut some of my hair  and I put it  Get the fuck out of here  You made like a fucking  A pussy  out of a roll  Wow  Let's just take a paper plate  and macaroni  and put a hole in it 
[01:35:30]  spray painted black  like a little kid  put it on your refrigerator  Put your hair on it  Did you come that way?  I can come any way  You fucked a roll?  Yeah, it was yum  Put your hair around the hole  Why would you just get a bagel?  Or at least go to Morton's  and get that warm bread  Why are you cutting your own hole?  That's sacrilege  Right  Can't use a bagel  Why not?  Oh, that is funny, man  This chick rules  And you really did make a difference  in this case  They're playing 
[01:36:00]  Have you seen this video yet, Steve-O?  This woman confronts Flasher  on the number four train  here in New York City  This guy had his dick out  He was rubbing up against her  And supposedly it was in a condom  and he was rubbing up  against this woman  and she was like  Fuck you  She unloaded on him  Yeah, they're playing this video  every five minutes  on every channel around  When she kicks his ass?

[01:38:30]  you know  then we have  enough room  for like  to light my head  on fire  and blow huge  fireballs off of it  you know  like  and so we gotta go  it's a problem  and I'm like  and they're like  they're saying  they don't know  if there's enough  room in the club  for that  and I'm like  no it'll be fine  it'll be fine  because if it's not  that it's either  fire or blood  it's like  and you want  fire over blood  it's either fire  or blood  you know  and  you do still feel  people expect  that from you  so you need to  like give them  at least a little  bit of that  I feel like  I'm in a  transitional period 
[01:39:00]  and you know  like it's  wild  like I don't know  if I just said  the last time  I was here  but like  Dane Cook's  been helping me out  with my comedy  and stuff  you know  and I was just  you know  yesterday  I was just  thanking him  and he's like  he's like  yeah you know  like  try not to  rely on  on  the dirty  stuff  too much  I'm like  come on  dude  like  yeah  give me a break  yeah  cut me some slack  I'm Steve Oestill  fuck  yeah  Jesus  yeah 
[01:39:30]  like  anybody  who's  thinking about  coming to  Caroline's  on Broadway  this weekend  because they  enjoyed me  on Dancing  with the Stars  it's not going  to be the show  for you  even though  man  I was  I was just  like  a couple weeks  ago  I was in  Marco Island  Florida  doing  the show  oh did I  hate that gig  really  fuck did I  do terrible  there in  Marco Island  we never  talked about  your Marco  Island gig  Captain  Brian's  yeah  Captain  Brian's  man  it went  great  and there 
[01:40:00]  was this  what did you hate  about it  Jimmy  there was no  audience  and the audience  was there  was awful  and then they  canceled  it's all their  fault  I hate it  when a comic  b-rates the  audience  they were terrible  because they  weren't my fans  they were just  old Florida  people  it was the  worst month  of the year  that I was  there  we canceled  an early show  Friday  which I was  fine with  I gave back  some money  I'm reasonable  you're used to that 
[01:40:30]  yeah I've  canceled plenty  of shows  but the guy  didn't even  come out  and go  hey thanks  for doing  that  I appreciate  it  I was so  fucking  irritated  I gave him  back 20%  of his money  and didn't even  go hey I  appreciate it  wow  I was working  for him  so I have a  hatred for that  place  then we had  a fallout  and then I  went back  and we did  a show  and then I  went back  one more  time  so I go  you know  give me a  date in May  and his  name is  Captain  Brian  yeah  he goes  he writes  back  he texts  Captain  Brian  the captain  you're back

[01:41:30]  you're not  a captain  you drive  a boat  on the  weekends  and drink  beer  it's the  expecting you  to call  them  captain  yeah  yeah  that's  yeah  the expectation  of the  title  oh hey  yes  captain  what about  the permission  to come  aboard  bullshit  yeah  that some  of these guys  really get  serious about  how bad  did you  bomb  the  car in the  water  shut up  I didn't  bomb  just the  crowds were  fucking old  they're not my  audiences  there were just  a lot of  older people  I'm like none  of these are  my fucking  people that  should be in  my show  they're just 
[01:42:00]  people that  kind of came  to a  it was just  fucking  miserable  right in front  of the stage  on my last  night there  there was a  couple celebrating  their 40th  anniversary  and I'm just  doing my  filthy shit  and I'm just  feeling like I  have to apologize  to this old  couple like  every like two  minutes  and uh  and afterwards  anything  that's when I  knew the  stand up  comedy shit  was working  for me  when that  that fucking  40th anniversary  couple was  like having a  good time  laughing at my  shit  man I had a  totally different  experience I  loved Marco 
[01:42:30]  Weiland  oh it's  fucking  and I  I never  fucking  bashed  because they  said to me  look I  had I  canceled on  them twice  because of  other uh  for TV stuff  and they said  look we have  uh this is the  worst month of  the year so I  wasn't expecting  sold out show  I understood  that they told  me that going  in it's a  very tough  month  fine  but it was  just that one  experience I  had I  didn't love  the crowds  uh at all  when have I  ever come on  the show  and said I  hated the  audiences  yeah  never  you'd rather  play skull  island  dude  that part 
[01:43:00]  of florida  was just  not good  for me  it's so funny  man they've  got like uh  that part of  florida  Marco island  they've got  the when you  pull up to a  stop sign  there's there's  like some kind  of a scent  your car sets  off a sensor  and the  flashlight  the stop sign  starts flashing  like  how fuck  is that about  yeah it's crazy  it's like all  the road signs  like work on  the assumption  that everybody's  shit faced  you know  or real old  or super old 
[01:43:30]  yeah  really old people  that are still  fucking driving  out there  it's like  the fucking  stop signs  are trying to  revive them  back from  heart attacks  right  I've never  seen that  before  it's hilarious  man I made  a little video  of it with my  phone  yeah it's not  a bad place  and ants in my  hotel room  but aside from  that it was  good  ants  yeah  ants  we moved  together  you haven't  gone back  nah it wasn't  I didn't hate  them I just  was annoyed  never go back  though  no probably  not  they don't  want me back  why would they  oh it's fine 
[01:44:00]  because you're  lovable  I'm a lovable  guy but  it's a bad  month  yeah  we're all  involved  but they have  good radios  Zito and  Garrett are fun  to do  yeah those  guys are great  man  I didn't do  Zito and Garrett  I did the  Flying Brian  too  yeah I did  that  he was fun  Zito and Garrett  really know what  they're doing  I was impressed  by those guys  are they daytime  guys  no they're  morning  they're on  regular radio  like anybody  listening to this  gives a shit  this is half our 
[01:44:30]  show Steve-O  it's fucking  time  man you know  another thing  about Mark  Island that was  really wild  I get on stage  and I'm talking  about how my  dick is just  permanently on this  fucked up angle  because I jack  off so incessantly  with my right  hand that my  dick is just  permanently just  off to the  left  you put it  off access  it's a crooked  ass dick  you know  it's a very  like below  average sized  crooked ass  dick and I  come so  fucking fast  and I'm just  such like  such a 
[01:45:00]  ridiculous slut  and then like  I cover myself  in blood  and then  I bring home  a chick  you got a  small mule  yeah  you have a  very below  average dick  man  what do you  got a  five  I don't know  what a five  is but it's  small  it's not  small small  it's like  average  you know  but I don't  understand  for the life  of me  why people  why do  pornos have  to have guys  with such  big dicks  it bums me  out man  like who 
[01:45:30]  wants to see  that  like I wish  that  why  why  no I  don't  it's  it's  really  you know  what really  bums me  out is  the whole  black guys  on the  white girls  that's what  it really  I like  seeing a  fucking  I want  a battering  ram  I want  a vagina  to almost  frown  before a  dick  goes  into it  I don't  get that  I'm with  him  if they  had like  a medium  to small  sized  dick  section  in the  porno  store  I would  shop  you think  it should  be like  clothing  where  they have  dick  sizes  you pick 
[01:46:00]  the size  that best  suits you  something  like that  I have  multiple  issues  with this  because  you're  watching  I can't  be bothered  with  pornography  that doesn't  have  cock  in it  like  Jay  Moore  said  if I'm  watching  a porno  someone  better be  getting  fucked  that's  true  words of  wisdom  I have  no time  for  lesbian  pornography  I feel  like  lesbian  pornography  it's like  a skateboard 
[01:46:30]  video  with just  footage  of ramps  and nobody  riding  it's just  a complete  waste of  time  I need  cock  as a  frame  of  reference  to relate  to  it's like  if a guy  has a huge  baseball bat  dick  and a chick  is trying  to suck  it  it's like  she's just  chewing on  the head  of it  I can't  fucking  dig that  I hate it  and then  it also  makes me  feel  inferior  you want  a relatable  dick 
[01:47:00]  in a movie  something you  could go  that could  be me  that could  be me  I could  pull that  off  yeah  you like  a big  big fat  cock  just because  it's like  to me  it's almost  like  if I'm  watching a  movie  I want  to see  people who  are great  actors  I don't  want to  see  guys  who just  walk off  the street  hold on  hold on  I could  tell  someone  was  setting  up  shut up  I wish 
[01:47:30]  it was  a shotgun  you're  telltale  joker  I'm old  school  go ahead  Rodney  get  this kid  over here  you really  did  hold on  I'll do  both parts  I mean  when I  watch a  movie  I want  to watch  good actors  don't 
[01:48:00]  watch  yourself  I didn't  say that  I wasn't  going to  say that  we knew  something like  that was  coming  I want  to see  fucking  guys  I shouldn't  be able  to relate  to them  I can't  function  the way  they do  anyway  I can't  stay hard  in front  of people  like that  have you  never tried  have you  in front  of friends  or whatever  I just  can't  when we  got girls  together  you  stayed  hard  yeah  but then  I was  jerking  off  it was  different  it was  so funny  watching him  shoot a load 
[01:48:30]  and hitting  himself in  the head  with his own  load  just sitting  there like  a mess  like a hunting  axe  these two  have the  greatest stories  man  I'm a distance  what was the  one with the  cat box  was that  with Voss  the girl  unfortunately  is dead  now  who we  and Voss  were fooling  around with  and he  came first  she was  laying  between us  and Voss  said to her  and me  he goes  hey let's  flip a coin  whoever loses  has to fuck  her  what balls  to say  that  and we're  both jerking  off  on our  surround 
[01:49:00]  he's on one  side  and then he  comes quickly  and goes to the  bathroom  so just me and her  in the bed  I'm trying to  come  and I hear  she had a  cat box  and there was  cat shit in it  and I can hear Voss  he's going  like an old Jew  at a diner  he's the  fucking most  he's such a  selfish asshole  we pulled a  train on this  one chick  where she  sucked my  dick  and then he  fucked her  and then he  came quickly  and he went  out for a  cigarette  could you 
[01:49:30]  at least keep  the mood  going  and smoke  shitty  ponytail  why did you  want him  around  it's not that  I wanted him  around  but it was  the dismissive  nature of  I'm done  like I'm done  fuck you  he could have  been smoother  about it  he wasn't  smooth about it  well you could have  smoke in her  house  I understand  that  one time  Chris Pontius  and I  we had  this one  chick  and  the chick  said  will you  guys stop  looking at 
[01:50:00]  each other  that was  really funny  she was  right in  between  and she  said  man  sometimes  I wish  I wish  I had  two mouths  nice  they take  care  it's like  wow you got  a vagina  yeah I know  it's true  exactly  it's kind of  like your mouth  doesn't talk  exactly  no teeth  in it  me and my  friend  used to

[02:03:30]  I've never  been to one  you know  and it seems  like you know  what the fuck  guys I grew up  with and stuff  you know  they want me  I think they want  me to do some  time though  do some  material  why would  they want  to ruin  everybody's  reunion  now we know  what happened  he got the  gig  I might not  even do it  but it's  right by my  house and I  want to see  guys I grew up  with  when are they  going  what's that  when is it  it's a  Saturday  oh fuck  that  I went to  one my  five year  it was just  depressing  five years  like you're  barely out 
[02:04:00]  that's easy  I know  everyone's still  the same  what are you  doing  nothing  but now  I'll be  shoehorn  bald  and fucking  that's you  I have a  full head of  hair  are you  hoping to  go and  just like  look better  than everybody  else  is that what  you want  to do  no I  just see  dudes I  grew up  with and  played  ball with  and I  have good  memories  back in the  day  you know  I get  good fucking  memories  what am I  gonna do  my whole  life I'm  just a  comic now  I had a  real life  before this  shit  you know  what I'm  saying  yeah we  heard about  it  exactly 
[02:04:30]  almost sucking  dick for  drugs  I went  the distance  and it  wasn't for  drugs  no but  that's  pretty awesome  to go to a  high school  reunion when  you didn't  graduate  isn't it  yeah  I did  do that  I did  do that  recently  I actually  went to  mine  well but  the thing  is too  I guess  they're having  three years  combined  so I'll  see like  a lot  of people  you know  the year  they have  to  because  so many  people  are dead 
[02:05:00]  how fucking  do  yeah  you think  a lot  of them  are dead  yes  oh yeah  35 years  my god  yeah  ask Anthony  to the high  school  ask him  about the  high school  reunion  he went  to recently  yeah  yeah  no I  wound up  taking a  girl that  was 18  years old  just to  piss off  like  everybody  in the  room  it worked  very well  too  one girl  was talking  to me  and she  thought I  was someone  else  another  Anthony  who happened  to be a  friend of  mine  years ago  and she's  talking to 
[02:05:30]  me  and she  was being  polite  just because  she thought  I was  someone else  and then  when she  found out  I wasn't  that person  she just  blasted me  about how  inappropriate  I was  why  fuck you  oh yeah  inappropriate  why  because I  brought a  girl that  was you  know  the age  these girls  were when  they were  in high  school  who cares  terrible  the fuck  is it  their business  you get  older  they just  stay  the same  age  they say  Steve  but it  really is  like fucking  living a  beautiful mind  you remember  how he goes  that's how  I knew  I was  I was 
[02:06:00]  crazy  because  she never  got any  older  and that's  the way  it is  when I  date  as soon  as they  have an  opinion  politically  they're  fucking  out  you know  I kind  of like  ouch  I don't  know  so what  are you  doing  is Bonnie  going  with you  no  she's  working  at the  comedy  shop  in  North  that  would  have  been  a  cool  because  she's  pretty  girl  you go  there  and you  go there  and you  see a bunch  of guys  there  with fat  pigs  and shit  I want 
[02:06:30]  to be the  only white  guy  I don't want  another white  person  her  ruin their  for me  it's all  black  people  right  most likely  it'll be  a lot  of black  people  huh  really  where I  went to  school  what area  was it  it was  in Plainfield  it was  mostly  blacks  so you  know  so it'll  be like  three of  us  that  graduated  or that  graduated  Jesus  Christ  no it'll  be fun  you must  have had  a great  time  when you  saw  a lot  of  no  you  know  what  it  really  wasn't  really  it  really  was  kind  of  like  this  is  stupid 
[02:07:00]  did  you  go  there  with  like  hey  I'm  Anthony  from  Obi  and Anthony  of course  why else  would I  go  but to  show  off  that  the guy  that didn't  graduate  made good  exactly  he makes  more money  than probably  all of them  that's the  beauty of  it was  me and  then that  midget guy  that just  died  it was  some  midget guy  that was  an advisor  like a  midget  advisor  to the  presidents  he's like  he's like  this charitable  midget  lawyer guy  and he  went to  my school  I remember  walking around  like a little  midget  in school  and he  ended up 
[02:07:30]  doing really  well  like fucking  little  midget  suit and  tie  and he's  there with  Bill Clinton  and fucking  Obama  and shit  like that  yeah  what a freak  accident  and then he  just recently  died  yeah cat  rolled him  into the  sewer  he had  had health  problems  his entire  life  and for a  midget to  live that  long  that's pretty  you know  offensive  it's pretty  unnecessary  for us to  have to  deal with  exactly  if you and  40 of your  friends aren't  in that car  in 30 seconds  entertaining me 
[02:08:00]  you just  don't really  see that  because back  back in that  day and age  you know  the health  care and  stuff for  people with  certain  problems  wasn't as  good  that's why  you didn't  see you  saw a lot  of like  fucked up  kids  but not a  lot of  fucked up  adults  like I went  to school  where there  was a kid  with a giant  like head  and he  couldn't even  hold it up  another kid  had an eye  that looked  like a goat  like you ever  look into a  goat's eye  and they got  that fuzzy  long 
[02:08:30]  when you're  talking to  them  it's rude  to look  away  I never  tried to  punk a  goat  it was a  staring  contact  you ever  look into  a goat's  soul  if you  look at  a goat's  eye  it's a  long  rectangular  pupil  like a  horse  same thing  with that  like fuzzy  looking  shit  it's like  fucked up  and this  one kid  I went  to school  with in  elementary  school  they were  calling it  like  mainstreaming 
[02:09:00]  and they  would take  the retarded  kids  and really  fucked up  kids  and put  them in  with the  normal  kids  hoping that  they would  be able to  interact in  society  and it  didn't work  it just made  the normal  kids creeped  out  like fucked  me up  I didn't  want to eat  lunch next  to the  kid that  was like  constantly  had snot  running out  his nose  and had  an eye  like a  goat  it scared  me  so I  don't even  know where  I was going  with this  one I just  know there  were retarded  kids in my  school  that you  were famous  and the  little guy  was  yeah and the  little midget  guy but now 
[02:09:30]  you know I  guess the  lifespan is  much greater  expecting people  to come up to  you and go  hey how's  you know like  I did get a  few that were  like you know  hey wow  you know I  listen to the  show  sucks  yeah but  sucks  I hate  talking about  comedy unless  I'm talking  to comedians  obviously even  on stage  I'm teasing  boss  come on  I liked it  no uh  I like I  hate talking  about like if  I'm playing  golf with a  stranger  comedy  the fuck  you know  leave me  alone  you know 
[02:10:00]  I played  yesterday  this guy  he's telling  these horrible  jokes the whole  fucking round  I go you  that's the  same thing  he's saying  no you're  like you  hate talking  comedy with  anybody who's  not bigger  than you  like if you  were playing  around and  golf with  tiger woods  or one of  those guys  and they  want to  talk comedy  you'd be  happy to  I would  talk comedy  with  yeah with  somebody who  is  I just said  it  yeah thank 
[02:10:30]  you  would you  talk comedy  with you  know  would you  talk comedy  with  president  obama  with  who  you know  I don't  know  now he's  got  now he's  said what  he was  going to  say  I'm  saying  you don't  like  talking  comedy  unless you're  with comics  right  with a  friend  I'll  talk  with comics  with comedians  with a  chick  I'm  trying to  fuck  I'm  always  happy  to talk  comedy  it's  an art  when it 
[02:11:00]  serves me  to talk  about it  it's just  some guy  that goes  you know  dude  I've been  thinking about  keep thinking  about it  but do it  quietly  I don't want  to hear it  your suggestions  got my mouth  full but we  got the rock  on the line  Dwayne Johnson  of course  yes Dwayne  Mr. Johnson  how are you  sir  hey good  morning  there he is  how are you  doing good  he's doing real  good  you're doing 
[02:11:30]  really good  you're down  playing  you're doing  great  this guy  you know  when he was  in the  WWE  huger than  huge  goes off  to start  an acting  career  and everybody  everybody  was just  going  uh oh  here's another  guy  it's like  top of his  game in one  industry  he's going  to another  gonna film  miserably  and you know  we were all  hoping for  failure there  Dwayne  now movie  after movie  after movie 
[02:12:00]  I know  he's got  these huge  movies now  he's a big  star  can you save  Mick Foley  we're a little  worried about him  what's going on  with Mick  I don't know  can you put him  in a movie  or something  he's our pal  he's hanging  around us  a little too  much  he could play  a chubby  villain  or a jack-o-lantern  he's one of  those crazy guys  who wouldn't  even need  a stunt  double  of course  no he would  do all his  own stunts  yeah he certainly  would  because they got  him wrestling  again and you  know how that  works out in the  end  we gotta get  him out of  wrestling  and get  him in  movies  he's down  in TNA  isn't he 
[02:12:30]  yeah he is  yeah you know  is that really  wrestling though  come on Dwayne  right  I like that  Dwayne is  keeping up  on the whole  wrestling bag  you still  talk with  the McMahons  at all  I do  you know  I connect  with Vince  every once  in a while  and Shane  too  every once  in a while  yeah what  did you think  about the run  for Senate  in Connecticut  there  you know  I thought  it was great  for her  if that's what  she wanted  I know she was  passionate about it 
[02:13:00]  so you know  I've always liked  Linda  we've always got  along great  so I was wishing  her well  yeah they spent  a lot of money  on that  were you thinking  like oh now  the money  now the checkbook  comes out  I'm there taking  bumps every  weekend and  now they bring  the checkbook  out  thanks a lot  yeah  how much better  is this life  than getting  knocked around  in a ring  how much better  is it  doing movies  oh man  it's  and you know  he's literally  laughing all the 
[02:13:30]  way to the bank  he's driving to  the bank right  now  it's so much  better  you're not on  the road  anymore  you know  and those guys  you know  their schedule  it's non stop  they're always  on the road  you know  it's funny  when I first  started doing  movies  when I made  the transition  over  I started  I started  making like  my own  car rental  my hotel  and you know  my publisher  saying oh  you don't have  to do that  I said what  do you mean  who does that  I gotta do it  because that's  what they're  so used to  and that's  what I was  used to  making all  the reservations  myself  you know 
[02:14:00]  no no no  we do that  for you  so now  he's got  people  that is nice  so wait  even when you  were at the  top of the  wrestling game  you were still  called  because Mick  is the worst  Mick told us  he was staying  in fans houses  but that was  just to kind  of save money  on hotels  well we learned  that Mick  Foley's a  cheapskate  Dwayne  he would sleep  in fans houses  on their couches  to save a few  bucks  Mick was making  millions of dollars  he would always  do that 
[02:14:30]  that was the  funny thing  about him  man  yeah we found  out he's quite  the skin flint  I'm obsessed  with him  he still flies  coach  I'm like  what are you  doing  you're a big  dude  he's like  you know  he's just a  weird guy  that's his  thing  that's his  gimmick  he saves  where he can  and then he  he'll wear the  flannel shirt  the whole time  and his little  sweatpants  and his sneakers  what are you  saving it for  you know what  I just read  Dwayne Johnson  obviously calling  for what movie  Faster 
[02:15:00]  Faster  right okay  but I also see  you also have  three more movies  that are in  production  holy crap  which ones  I don't know  offhand  it says three movies  currently in production  you don't even know  you've made so many movies  I wrapped  Faster  obviously  and I also  just wrapped  the Fast and  Furious franchise  we introduced  a new character  to that franchise  where I hunt  down Vin Diesel  all right on  look at you  in that one too  Jesus  who's in this  I know Billy Bob 
[02:15:30]  is in this one  with you right  yeah  Billy Bob  is in this one  we also have  we have Tom  Berenger  Maggie Grace  and Carla Cagino  okay  you get a real cast  yeah I guess  a really solid cast  these guys came through  what's it about  it's about  my brother  basically we're  we're robbing a bank  and my brother's  the only family  that I have  and the bank  the bank heights  goes awry  they kill my brother  these other guys  who we did it with  they kill my brother  and they try and kill me  only I live  so I go to prison  I serve 10 years in prison 
[02:16:00]  when I get out  the only thing I have left  is to go find these guys  and hunt them down  and kill them  wow  so it's kind of like  the Tooth Fairy  a little bit  yeah it sounds like  a feel good movie right  only minus the pink  it's amazing how you play  literally from Tooth Fairy  or Race to Witch Mountain  to something like this  or Walking Tall  so you really do play  a variety of things  well you know  the goal is to be  diverse  and when I first started acting  like you guys were saying 
[02:16:30]  you know  when I first started acting  there were challenges man  not only coming from  the wrestling business  but just  you know generally  it's always met  with rolled eyes  and it was important  to me then  to try and be  a good actor  just a diverse actor  and I just didn't want  to stay in action  because then that would  have been boring for me  so once I  finished my  last match  I think it was  with Brock Lesnar  and at that time  I recognized then  that I just wanted  to be a diverse actor  well  do you have to deal  with Brock in the ring  you're like  you know what acting's 
[02:17:00]  yeah Brock doesn't play  right  no  you know I have  something in common  with Dwayne  yeah Steve-O  Steve-O's in studio  how's it going man  hey I went to  University of Miami  for a little bit there  I know you did man  and then you went  to clown school  I know you  yeah  right on dude  the rock  right on man  that makes me feel  great dude  thanks  by the way  you guys are crushing  man with that  new movie man  you guys kicked ass  with it  congratulations  hey thanks a lot man  I appreciate that  Jackass 3D was hilarious  and then the rock 
[02:17:30]  will you know  get in this movie  and it'll be number  one at the box office  hey Dwayne do you  do your own stunts  all right  yeah when it's  you know the thing  about it is the studio  always freaks out  about stuff like that  so you know when you  can and it's safe  and then you do them  but you know if not  I got a great stunt  of a man who kicks ass  we're obsessed with  Tom Cruise and what  he's doing for his  latest movie  he's amazing  it's hanging from  the building  you saw that  have you seen it  Rich  no  we have  I'll show boss  it's  what I was wondering  is too  is the insurance  to allow Tom Cruise 
[02:18:00]  to repel  at 1500 feet  has got to be  astronomical  the studio must  really get nauseous  every time he does  something like that  I want to know  if Dwayne's stunt double  has what are those  muscles even called  the ones like  on top of your shoulders  on top of the other muscles  yeah like  does your stunt double  have those things  like that  he's crazy man  he's crazy  like you  he's crazy  the guy would jump  off a building for me  did you train  as an actor  after you  wrestled 
[02:18:30]  that's Rich Voss  do you know Rich Voss  he's not part of our show  we don't know who he is  no I want to know  if he trained  that's a good  assistant for the day  local comic  we're just trying to  help him out a little bit  first of all  of course he works  on his craft  you know  would train  train in what way  did you go to acting  class  did you have a private  acting coach  sure  I worked with  great acting coaches  right when I started  I worked with great  acting coaches  and even then  I  you know  even when the mummy  returned  Ted told the studio 
[02:19:00]  you know  I'd really like to  really get good  and I want to  I want to get a  great acting coach  and they're like  okay well you know  you just have one line  in this movie  he's also a natural  when he was with the  WWF at the time  now the WWE  I don't ever remember  a wrestling match  I just remember  what he did on the mic  working the mic  yeah  it was unbelievable  and when you left  like I said  top of the game  in wrestling  and a likable  character is what  it was also  so when you go to 
[02:19:30]  movies  it's not like  I didn't like that guy  like he's just  a really likable guy  on WWF  and does Vince  own your name  the old name  The Rock  we co-own it  that Vince  is a smart man  huh  I hope you have  Rock and he's  just got the  that's funny  Vince makes it  hard for these guys  to move on  with their names  I gotta tell you  it was really easy  you know  when I left  I just had a conversation  with him about it 
[02:20:00]  and he said  well it's yours  you earned it  but I think it also  goes back to  my grandfather  wrestled for his dad  and my dad  wrestled for him  so there was  some lineage there  and I said  I'd always been  up front with him  for a long time  about what I wanted  to do  and where I wanted  to go  and I had the  conversation with him  about the name  I said I'm not  quite too sure  if I'd like to  use it down the line  but if I do  I'd like to have  the opportunity  to do it  and you know  he's like  yeah pal  you got it  it's your name  right on  we'll co-own it  we're obsessed 
[02:20:30]  with Vince McMahon  we haven't had him  on in a while  but we're obsessed  with him  you can have him  on man  he's rough  he's rough  you were on there  during the heyday  when it was just  crazy too  with like  now buff my ass  the ass  buffing  I think he missed  the buff ass  he didn't have to  buff Vince's ass  no he didn't have  to buff the ass  that was after  the rock  when it started  getting really insane  where everyone  had to kiss  Vince's ass  I don't know  I remember  Dwayne being there  when it was pretty 
[02:21:00]  fucking crazy  did you have to  buff or kiss  Vince's ass  I was there  on the tail end  of that  he had to  kiss my ass  club  yeah  kiss my ass  club  god damn  Vince  said he had  a professional  buffer come out  and get his  hiney all shiny  you buff my ass  you'll get it  all shiny  I gotta tell you  man that was  the uh  you guys remember  that was the  best time  oh yeah  we flew under  the radar  you guys know  that we did  anything  we said anything  and it wasn't  corporate at that  time  no 
[02:21:30]  I think it was  I think we had  just become a  corporate company  but still  we were still  able to  like there was  nothing we  couldn't do  yeah  it was  it got  every week  you tune in  just to see  how much  more ridiculous  it was gonna  get  you're talking  about a radio  show or wrestling  because we went  through the same  exact thing  Dwayne  once they start  knowing what  you're doing  and a couple  of politicians  notice things  and start  talking about it  it's like  oh crap  this is over  oh man  you get crushed  I know  you guys gave  birth to a hand  who's that  I'll never forget  that  the 80 year old 
[02:22:00]  Moolah  no the other one  May  May Young  May Young  gave birth to a  fucking hand  she was 80 something  oh my god  these guys are insane  Vince's daughter  chained to the  boiler room  because she was  kidnapped by  by Kane  it was so  and her acting  was so bad  it was laughable  you can tell  it was Vince's  daughter  no one else  would have survived  no one cared  with that bad acting  oh it was 
[02:22:30]  and then Shane  was just taking  bumps like crazy  it got to the point  where it's like  what are you doing  you're a multi-millionaire  son  heir to the throne  and he's  he's flying off  the top of a cage  speaking of which  do you know where  Shane is  because he just  kind of disappeared  he had an appearance  on our show  at this point  it's got to be  about two years ago  and basically hinted  he's out  he's gone  and he's moving on  but what is he  going to do  I think he's got  business overseas  a lot  he does really well  over there  oh hashish  that's very lucrative 
[02:23:00]  very lucrative  hashish  there was rumors  that he was going  to UFC  but then it just  never happened  I think so  I think he might have  had a couple of  meetings with Dana  but I'm not quite  too sure why  but you know  Shane's a smart guy  man  and been around  and always  and by the way  with all the bumps  that he was taking  at that time  I always appreciated  that about Shane  he was always willing  to really bust his ass  because he knew  that he wasn't  a full time worker 
[02:23:30]  one of the boys  but then  he just proved himself  every week  and every pay-per-view  just put his body  on the line  it was crazy  yeah he  well he absolutely  knew what you guys  were going through  so he couldn't  just say something  without you guys  going well  he doesn't know  what we're doing  I think he had no choice  being the boss's son  you get out there  earn your keep  right right  with UFC  and stuff like that  do you think  in a different time  or a different age  whatever  if it was more popular 
[02:24:00]  when you were  in your prime  in wrestling  do you think  you might have  gone that route  I've not  I think I might have  gone that route  had I not got  into wrestling  from University of Miami  from college  but you know  once I got into wrestling  I loved wrestling  because I grew up in it  so you know  and I had the  great fortune  of doing pretty good  in it  so you know  I know that  a couple of guys  left  and they went over  like for example  take Brock  I think Brock  was so passionate 
[02:24:30]  about what he did  and such an  incredible athlete  but then at the end  of the day  he just said  I just don't like it  and he just  and he just  and he just left  you know  I loved wrestling  so I don't think  I would have left  wrestling for UFC  but I admire  the hell out of that  sport man  they got to train  like motherfuckers  it is something  it's not an easy  sport to just get into  I think you got to  be brought up in it  yeah it helps  it helps when you  have a wrestling  background  a foundation like that  you know  which certainly  helped Brock  but yeah  those guys are 
[02:25:00]  unbelievable man  with the discipline  to have  and the discipline  that it takes  and I think  that's a common  thing you find  with a lot of guys  who think  oh yeah  you know  they watch it on TV  the UFC  and like yeah  that's what I'm going to do  and they think it's  easier than it is  run into a lot of guys  who you know  love to say  they're going to  jiu-jitsu practice  and shit like that  yeah jiu-jitsu  well jiu-jitsu  jiu-jitsu  well Dwayne's  a very busy man  we got to get him  off the phone here  but the movie  the movie looks good  it's called  Faster with 
[02:25:30]  Billy Bob Thornton  and of course  yourself in the  starring role  Dwayne Johnson  it's out today  too  most people don't  have to get up  tomorrow  so you can just  go watch it today  yeah absolutely  Dwayne thanks a lot  man  alright boys  thanks for having me on  always cool  good luck  absolutely  thanks later  Dwayne Johnson  what a great guy  I know the rock  dude he's a stand up  guy he's been  doing our show  for well over 10  years he walked  off our show once  and we were able  to you know  work that out  yeah it was a  third party guilt  by association thing 
[02:26:00]  but never forgot us  he walked off  like I remember  one time just  not leaving  you  yeah that's right  our show was over  Steve's like in the  fucking hallway  I remember stepping  over Steve all  once so I could  get to the elevator  because he was  sleeping  but he never forgot  us a lot of these  guys on their way up  and they become  massively huge  they had like  Opie and Anthony  who but not  not Dwayne  he's a stand up guy  he was on there  for a while man  that was great  it's just getting  bigger and bigger  so are those 
[02:26:30]  fucking muscles  on top of the  no shit  what are they  called  Rich you know  traps  I think it's  above the traps  there's nothing  above the traps  it's a joke  because they  so ridiculously  in shape  yeah the muscles  on top of the  traps  no one can  get  traps  I just saw  a photo of  that recently  it is crazy  I feel mine  they're just huge  that guy Brock  you were talking  about isn't he  wasn't he in  studio  doesn't he come  here  I'm going to  take a break  Steve-O's at 
[02:27:00]  Caroline's this  weekend Wednesday  which is today  through Sunday  212-757-4100  he's a what  isn't he the  full contact guy  the black dude  that you had  in the studio  yeah that's  exactly him  Brock Lesnar  the black  full contact guy  I don't know  who I'm asking  who he is  I'm sorry  if I don't know  you got his  color wrong  you got what  he does wrong  you weren't  even close  oh I meant  Lou Brock  wasn't he a  baseball player  yes he was  and so with  Brock Peters  was an actor  and Brock  dummy is you  I fully understand 
[02:27:30]  now  oh my god  we looked up  Steve-O's  one of his  conquests  yeah exactly  he was with  Robin from  real world  San Diego  and I don't  I don't  I don't think  I saw that season  and then I saw 
[02:28:00]  the pictures  and I remember  her being really hot  with the real  big Greek  tits  she's only gotten  more beautiful  and they're real  right  I believe so  yeah  and now we  understand why  you're looking  her up and  beating off to her  there's a bunch  of pictures of her  really soapy  in the shower  holy shit  man  what is she up  to you think  anything  I don't know  man  she kind of  just went away  right  yeah  I want to  make love to her  again  I know that  yeah  well maybe we  could put the 
[02:28:30]  word out for you  you never know  maybe she'll make  it to Caroline's  this weekend  what else does  she have going on  it would be rad  how good would that be  yeah man  I'll be psyched  to see a Caroline's  I'm going to try  to make one of  the Steve-O shows  this weekend  I want to see  what Steve-O's  up to  that would be  great man  can you tell us  what the closer  is with the  stunt  the stunt  as I told you  it's either  blood or fire  blood or fire  and you're  hoping for fire  it's trademark  you're done  with the blood  thing  I'll do  tonight  I think it's  blood  I feel awkward 
[02:29:00]  having Steve-O  in for this long  without asking him  to do anything  but it's cool  I don't know  what to do  are we supposed  to be telling you  could you run  through that window  I don't know  I kind of like it  it's you know  it's a different  Steve-O  talking  it's great  it's all good man  coherent  it's amazing  I'm just  I'm just glad  he remembered  being on our show  because there  were some times  yeah  wow  yeah  it got a little  bit dark  wow  some jackass  was just giving me 
[02:29:30]  no pun  so it was just  giving me shit  saying like  oh Anthony  you're talking  about midgets  and Steve-O's  best friends  and midget  I was cringing  I'm fine  with midget  you know  you were pretty  harsh on the  little fella  that you went  to school with  I'm not talking  about anyone's  friend  Jesus  I'm so much  more deeply  offended by  blacks  by people  saying  by the term 
[02:30:00]  little people  really  yeah  of course  because that's  going to become  the slur  how can you  call somebody  a little  person  without  belittling  them  thank you  that really  is wise  it does  sound like  that  because you're  still acknowledging  they're different  from what we're  saying is acceptable  as a general  rule  you know  like take  Wee Man  Wee Man and I  are so tight  and I just  like  how tall  Wee Man 
[02:30:30]  stands  is really  not  it's not  got anything  to do with  anything  you don't  refer to him  as a little  person  you know  like as a  person  that sounds  demeaning  yes  you know  a little  person  he's gotta  be insulted  by that  you know  like yeah  like a little  person  it just seems  like as an  entity  like he's  just small  you know  like there's  his height  but you know  he's just not  a little  person  right  right  so I go  with midget  every time  every single 
[02:31:00]  you gotta go  with midget  I just don't  I don't care  you know  and in Wee Man's  case I did get  specific permission  to call him  midget  but like  and you know  across the boards  I just have to say  like if I say  midget  and that  offends people  then that just  gives me an  opportunity to  point out  how offensive  little person  is  and it seems  like across  the boards  almost every  attempt to  become more  politically correct  by replacing  one term  with another  is always  just a step  backwards  it's so stupid 
[02:31:30]  it's just a step  backwards  like take  African American  I just don't  get it  like the whole  point of being  American is that  you're not from  America  you know  yeah  so imagine  if we're gonna  call black people  African American  then that's to  suggest that we  would need to  trace everybody's  lineage  so then like  you would have  to call me  like an  English  Irish  American  you know  like once you  get into that  like it's not  America anymore  I like perp  and what about  black people  what about  black people  you call 
[02:32:00]  African American  yeah I'm  from Jamaica  asshole  you know  like  yeah  then they  get mad at you  well sometimes  people say  well the lineage  of Jamaicans  is Africa  so it's still  African American  this is my  favorite  when somebody  is not even  American  not even  American  and they're  from Africa  they come here  and are described  as an African  American  they're here  for a week  right  it's  it makes no  sense to call  a black person  especially if you're  giving let's just  say a description  I'm not saying  why  how  who 
[02:32:30]  when  but  to say  an African  American  male  doesn't  it's  inaccurate  because you  don't know  you don't know  if he's just  trucking  got off a plane  from somewhere  here's a political  correctness in this  country  where they don't  want to  they don't want  to profile  when it comes  to security  right  but yet  the FBI  solves  most of their  serial killings  and rapings  and mass  murders  from profiling  you have to  profile  well it cuts  down on your  amount of  suspects  yes 
[02:33:00]  okay  they know  that every  single time  something happens  well 99%  of the time  it's a certain  profile  they know  to look at  that type  of profile  well then why  aren't they  doing that  at the airport  because it's  very rude  yeah  and they  went from  crippled  to handicapped  you know  like  handicapable  now  I like  handicapable  I heard  that someone  told me  the term  handicapped  I mean  it came  from  when  when 
[02:33:30]  people  came back  from like  World War II  I guess  and they  were like  you know  begging  on  these  war veterans  they were like  amputees  and stuff  or whatever  and they were  like begging  on the street  literally holding  out their hat  you know  so it's like  cap in hand  handicapped  like  you're calling  them fucking  beggars  you know  it's like  wow  I didn't know  that  because they  have their  cap in their  hand  they're holding  their hat  out for money  and it's like  the cap in hand 
[02:34:00]  and they just  call them  handicapped  they could have  just easily  been called  fisty hat  I don't know  that this is true  but that's what  I heard  it seems like  it makes sense  another example  of political  correct being  dumb  and you know  it's in  handicap too  you know  when two weeks  ago  two weeks  on the marathon  there's always  one that has  to run  and hold up  the fucking  race  were you talking  about that  really  I got water  I didn't  you know  it's like  yeah it takes  like a week  we even know  her name  Lynn  Kaplopowicz 
[02:34:30]  or something  like that  she makes  sure she's  last every year  at the marathon  why are we  beating her up  she's just  why because  she's irritating  she ties up  traffic  that's why  Jimmy  you're right  hey can we  get Noel  Bitterman in  here  I think he's  with  he might be  with Scott  I just saw him  come in  so it's how  Noel Bitterman  Noel Bitterman  a big sponsor  for the show  Bitterman  he's also  I think he  AshleyMadison.com  is his  and CougarLife.com 
[02:35:00]  and EstablishedMen.com  Ashley Madison  is the one  where you at  with Cougar  Steve-o  Sarah Palin  you said earlier  yeah Sarah Palin  is red  I don't know  I'm down  with some  Cougar action  I really don't  I really don't  mind too much  like I just  come so fast  you know  it doesn't  really matter  I'm down  to disappoint  just about  anyone  really  I was 
[02:35:30]  when I was  like  29  or 30  I was like  with a 56  year old lady  yeah  how'd that work  out for you  he came quick  like usual  got his dick  caught in her  charm bracelet  do you say  Vitamin or Bitterman  how do you  say your name  Bitterman  oh Bitterman  or C  get it  Noel Bitterman  I'll tell you  what guys  I'm gonna get  out of here  man  everyone come  by Caroline's  Caroline's on  Broadway this  weekend  and I'm  fucking so  stoked 
[02:36:00]  I love you  guys  good luck  buddy  hey thanks  have fun  man  go see  Steve-o  Caroline's  tonight at  Caroline's  every night  until Sunday  cool weekend  see you over  the weekend  thanks Steve  Steve how you  doing  Bitterman  he's shaking  the hand  of the  Bitterman  hey Bitterman  you wanna  move up  yeah move up  to the  table  saw your  subway  tape  Mr.  Bitterman  get it  teasing of course  we don't want to 
[02:36:30]  bash the sponsor  too badly  do you own  you conceptualize  and own  Ashley Madison  that's me  now uh  wow  how'd you  figure there was  a need for this  you know  if 30% of people  going to singles  dating sites  are already  in relationships  there's probably  a market  for a site  dedicated to  people already  in relationships  30%  how annoyed  do you get  this is what  drives me nuts  people criticize  Ashley Madison  how annoying  is the moralizing  that people do  when marriages  basically a lot  of them are shit  and people are  cheating anyway  but they're all  up in arms 
[02:37:00]  over this site  I think the point  is that you know  somehow I'm being  labeled as the guy  who invented  infidelity as if  it didn't exist  before Ashley Madison  which is just  obviously  beyond ridiculous  so the notion  is you know  can I convince  someone in a  30 second TV  commercial  or 60 second  radio spot  to have an  affair  absolutely not  can I tell  them not to  do it on  the singles  dating site  or not to  do it in  the workplace  where they're  going to risk  losing their  job  yes that's  what I'm  trying to do  cannibalize  what we know  happens all  over the place  and your wife  is with you  this is her  first  she doesn't  do a whole  lot of  interviews  I've never  done a radio 
[02:37:30]  interview before  I chose  an easy venue  for her  yes  I think I  met her  on your  website  you may  have  do you  know  which was  she's a  happily married  woman  I know what  it takes to  be in a happy  marriage  if anybody  on the planet  should know  it should be  me  how did  Noel break it  to you  that this  was his  that's 90%  true  how did he  tell you about  this site  like he said  look I have a  great idea  for a site  yeah and I  thought he was  bullshitting  did you wonder  why he was 
[02:38:00]  doing it  until I looked  at some of  the research  and then I  realized that  we're all  going to hell  did you realize  like hey what  the fuck are you  doing this  research for  no I think  everybody  what's in it  for you  everyone's  opinions were  varied from  that is the  most brilliant  thing I ever  heard to you  must be  fucking nuts  but you know  ultimately I  wanted to do  this I really  did  this is what  I always  thought too  I'm like  this site  will never  last because  something is  going to  happen where  an ex is  going to get  jealous and  something crazy  is going to  happen and  then they're  going to  blame the  it's kind  of like the  way they  targeted  craigslist  they blame  for the 
[02:38:30]  people using  it which  is stupid  I think  the site  in bigger  jeopardy is  someone like  match.com  or facebook  if they don't  try to do a  better job of  not letting  affairs happen  there ultimately  someone who  imagine you're  a woman you  sign up to  match.com  you meet  this guy  you really  like him  you go home  with them  you sleep  with them  and then you  find out he's  married and  you claim oh  that was like a  sexual assault I  didn't realize he  was a married  guy I never  would have given  it up then  I'm going to  sumatch.com  for a hundred  million dollars  they told me  they were connecting  with other  single people  that's what I  think is in  potential jeopardy  truthfully I  think we're  being forthright  hey these are  married people 
[02:39:00]  coming together  here to do  this kind of  thing you know  if you don't  want to participate  in this for sure  if you're a  person of faith  if you're in a  great marriage  this isn't the  platform for you  but if your  marriage is shaky  and you don't  want to leave it  and you're looking  for something on  the side this is  the right platform  but what if  they're not married  and they're going  to your site  they do listen  30% of the women  on the side  are single women  women who don't  have a sense  of sisterhood  but you were  married  that sucks  I thought I was  cheating  no but the guy  what if the guy  is going after  vulnerable  married women  vulnerable  vulnerable 
[02:39:30]  that happens  listen there are  vulnerable married  women  60 something percent  of divorce in  America are  initiated by women  because they've  had enough of  their guys  if you forget  to remind your  wife that she  still looks  beautiful  to pay attention  to her when she  does her hair  and if you're  not there for  ultimately  women straight  too  there seems  to be  that's the  other thing  that's been  the lightning  rod  is that people  cannot believe  how many women  are on Ashley  Madison  and that's what  really infuriates  so many people  there's got to  be pictures  with the profile  people have  bigger walls  than I ever  would  it's private 
[02:40:00]  photos  so the way  Ashley Madison  works is  everything is  discreet  your communication  this day and age  these guys  we hear about  getting busted  they're getting  busted because  they're foolish  they're sending  text messages  look at Tony Parker  if you do that  you're going to  get discovered  on Ashley Madison  we don't charge  you to have  these communications  so they're  free ongoing  you may as well  keep all your  communication  on Ashley Madison  don't take it  to your cell phone  don't take it  to your personal  device  that's where  the digital lipstick  gets you  discovered  like carrier pigeon  they're never  successful  I actually hire a 
[02:40:30]  plane to sky  ride  smoke signals  work as well  but the photos  too  the photos are all  under lock and key  or you can publish  them to the community  but you only give  them up one to one  when you've had  some sort of  connection with  the other people  this is  someone I want to  connect with  and I trust  I'm going to  send them the  photo  and that's  your biggest  site  of established  men  Cougar Life  Ashley Madison  is in nine  countries  three languages  has 7.8 million  members  it's the fastest  going social  network on the  planet  excluding Facebook  and by all  stretches  there's no doubt 
[02:41:00]  we'll have 100  million members  in the next  couple of years  it's a phenomenon  is it true  you're in Saudi  Arabia  and you hook  up people  to stone  women  that cheat  isn't that  a point  we look at  countries like  Saudi Arabia  that do  that  and we're  appalled  by it  and so  a long time  ago we stopped  painting people  with scarlet letters  it's really easy  to sit there  and judge people  and say  oh that Bill  Clinton  oh that David  Letterman  oh that Tiger  they're bad guys  they're cheaters  but we don't  know what goes  on in their  bedrooms  they had their  reasons for doing  it and let's  just let people  live their lives  this is on it 
[02:41:30]  look I don't  think people  who are married  should cheat  but if you are  it's like this  phony moralizing  wouldn't they not  take your ads  I know you tried  to advertise  somewhere and they  would like the NFL  probably wouldn't  take his ads  it's crazy to me  like somehow the NFL  is the new  bastard of morality  so programming  it's violent  it's aggressive  if you've been  to an NFL game  of late  I mean there's  6,000 drunk people  getting busted  for acting like crazy  nutcases all the time  but more importantly  look at their advertising  Viagra  the only function  of that product  is to facilitate sex  so it can't be  that they have this 
[02:42:00]  you know aversion  to sex ads  because you know  that's part of  what Ashley Madison is  they advertise  alcohol consumption  glorify it  we know that  you know alcohol  is going to lead  to disease and addiction  and death in America  for what 20,000 people  this year  drunk driving  it is what it is  but you know  we don't want the NFL  to be the bastion  of morality for America  and more importantly  I don't think you really  want broadcasters  sitting there saying  you know  if a product is legal  and it's not violating  any sort of  the content of the ad  isn't offensive  making decisions  saying oh we don't  like this  what if you know 
[02:42:30]  20 years ago  I was trying to create  an interracial dating site  and you said  oh well  we don't want to take those ads  well  you'd have gotten letters  from me my friend  I'm not telling you  get them last week  this is America  thank God  I can build a business  like that  we should all applaud that  we don't have to use the site  but that's the country  we've created  I know what site  I'm going to  I know  but how much  is it to join  how do you join  money on there  it's free to join  members since 2008  it only costs money  if you want to send messages  to other people  it's not like a traditional  dating service  affairs don't play out 
[02:43:00]  like a subscription  where you sign up  and say every month  I'm going to bill you  it's only when you want  to speak to other people  that we charge you  do you get charged  per communication  yeah  and then it's free  once you  if you and I initiate it  not that I'm saying  I'm on the download  we're both unshaven  that can be kind of hot  but you know  you end up  you know  once the communication  channel's open  you can speak to that  person for the next  five years  you never have to  take it to your  personal email  on your phone  I think that's the key  so you don't get  charged per email  with them  this guy's worth  a shitload of money  oh yeah  a site like this  is it almost like 
[02:43:30]  when you come up  with a movie idea  like you copyright it  or do you have to  have it made before  it's actually a great  question because I  regret not  copywriting Mary Dating  no I mean  we trademark Ashley  Madison do all those  kinds of things  but at the end of the  day you're right  connecting married people  and the way that we do  it it's a whole process  and we really should  have tried to look at  some sort of patent  on the whole thing  we've actually been  exploring that lately  it's a great question  what is the name  Ashley Madison  from where  Ice Cream  Dolly Madison  no it was 
[02:44:00]  you know  men were going to  behave this way  because James Madison  wouldn't have been  just as sexy  it's just too  presidential  Biederman.com  just didn't have  a great ring to it  I didn't think  that women would  sign up  but that was it  I knew dudes  would do this  would women go  and have anonymous  affairs  before that  all my research  said women  had affairs  in two places  in their circle  of influence  they were sleeping  with their  friend's husband  or their sister's  husband  that kind of thing  or they were doing  it in the workplace  but to go and have  an anonymous affair  I was going to  almost have to invent  it  so all my marketing  was going to be  after a year  and I needed a brand  and a persona  that women would 
[02:44:30]  feel comfortable with  so if you look  at the site  especially in the  beginning  the design was  very feminine  the advertising  was very feminine  Ashley and Madison  were the two most  popular little girls  names in America  at the time  so women were  going to name  their children  that I thought  they'd have  an affinity  for that branding  wow  I'm so dumb  I just would have  called it  cheat.com  as soon as you  did that  we did focus groups  as soon as you  put the word cheat  in the URL title  women said  I won't go there  we knew we couldn't  do that  that's why 
[02:45:00]  when I've seen  sites come up  and they're like  cheating wives  I know they're  full of shit  because no woman  would ever sign up  that sort of thing  what scares me too  is I used to go  to alt.com  because I'm a perv  and I didn't like  alt.com  because I didn't  feel like they were  real people  I don't even mind  if they were hookers  can you explain  what that is  it's obviously similar  but alternative  yeah it was for like  S&M and B&D  and kinky swingers  I found that most  of the appealing  profiles were not real  they were either  spam ads or stuff  like that  as spam began  to get bigger  it just wasn't  what I thought 
[02:45:30]  it was going to be  I never met  a real person  off of alt.com  I had a profile  I think that's the  question a lot of  people have  you're actually  meeting real people  through actually  one of the big  things that I think  a lot of sites  why they failed  they had some  good ideas  is they let  cam girls in  and date them  they let prostitutes  in and date them  they let all sorts  of bullshit go on  we made it  our kind of  corporate goal  to sit there  and say  every profile  gets reviewed  before it gets  released to the  community  that way we  keep it as a  real community  who's looking  to have an  affair  if there's  people on  there listening  that's great  there's other  platforms for them 
[02:46:00]  but that's not  really what  Ashley Madison  is about  that's not  what the  people are  expecting  and so  we suspend  probably three  four hundred  profiles a day  of people  who are coming  on there  looking to  kind of behave  in what's  just not the  right place  for Ashley Madison  fatties  fatties  right  no  I think  one of the  great things  about Ashley Madison  is I don't care  how old you are  as a woman  how much you weigh  you know  if you go on there  you know  within 48 hours  there's a dude  interested in meeting  when someone's  having an affair  even if you're  doing online  don't they want  to be as discreet  and as possible 
[02:46:30]  they don't want  to give their  information  so their profile  is going to be  all as generic  as possible  well it depends  listen I never  ask you your name  it's all done  anonymously  from you know  from the moment  you sign up  people ask me  what celebrities  are on there  what athletes  are politicians  surely they are  but I never  ask you your name  so everything  you build  is around  this anonymity  and I think  that helps  preserve it  because you're  right the foundation  of an affair  is are you  going to have  sex and are  you not going  to get caught  and so we're  trying to help  them with both 
[02:47:00]  paradigms  I'm sorry  what's it show  up as on the  credit card  not Ashley Madison  not Ashley Madison  ok  he's good  oh you have  a bunch of  different ones  ok so once  it leaks  a wife can't  just start looking  at her husband  if it's stuff  worse than  yeah I know  childlovers.com  that's horrible  what a dumb  question I was  to ask him  what it shows  up on the  credit card  every woman 
[02:47:30]  who would  give out  their passcode  yeah  exactly  boss  how long  are you guys  married  we're married  what eight  years now  what did you  do before this  I was a sports  attorney so  one of the  things that I  think may have  impacted  so when I  saw this data  30% of people  going to singles  dating sites  are already  married  wow what an  opportunity  maybe it's  because every  one of my  athletes was  beyond unfaithful  I used to get  phone calls in  the middle of  the night  my job was 
[02:48:00]  to take our  ex-NBA players  and put them  in leagues  overseas  I get calls  from guys  going hey  I've got a  real problem  my wife's  coming to  visit me  over in  Italy now  what am I  going to  tell my  Italian wife  what Italian  wife  oh I got  married over  here I  forgot to  tell you  you can't  do that  well I  didn't know  that  that was  the kind  of bullshit  that was  going on  day in  day out  so I  was in  the universe  where marriage  and being  faithful were  not necessarily  linked  these people  still in their  minds stay  married but  they were  playing around  like crazy  and so maybe  when the idea  of a business  around infidelity 
[02:48:30]  came up  because I'd  been in that  culture for so  many years  maybe it  made sense  where somebody  else would  look and say  that's nuts  so what kind  of backlash  have you gotten  like you said  the NFL  wouldn't take  your ads  especially since  Michael Vick  can now play  after fucking  strangling and  murdering dogs  they're fine with  that  Brett Favre  can send  around his  junk  to an  employee  of the  Jets  that's my  point  I'm actually  on Brett's  side with that  except his  penis is horribly  short and  unattractive looking  unless it was  stepped on by a  large man  if he had just  sent it to a  woman who  wasn't an  employee of  the organization 
[02:49:00]  he wouldn't  have had any  of these  problems  and we  don't even  know if  he ultimately  did it  but my  point is that  athletes behave  in this way  the notion  that somehow  the NFL  where every  other week  some guys  in the strip  club get in  some sort  of fight  that they're  going to be  the bastion  of American  morale  that's just  silly  they're just  shitheads  what other  backlash have  you got  I'm sure  you've got  by the way  you guys  do great  PR stuff  when Tiger  broke  brilliant  to offer him  how much  did you guys  offer him  5 million  to be a  spokesman  even though 
[02:49:30]  Tiger's never  going to  accept that  he just  wouldn't  he couldn't  it's still  genius  because the  media picks  up on that  of course  I'm becoming  this expert  on the topic  because I run  this business  and because  celebrities are  constantly being  outed  I think in  the past  journalists  weren't as  likely to  do this  or as  anxious  to do it  now they  seem to  want to  do it  more often  and so  they too  are in  the business  of infidelity  they cover it  ad nauseum  and then they  turn to me  first  so why would  a rich guy  cheat  and risk  it all  as opposed  to them  knowing the  obvious  answers 
[02:50:00]  to it  and so  it affords  us a great  opportunity  to talk  about our  brand  5 million  I'll do it  for 50,000  can you swing  a golf club  yes  can actually  he's really  good  he cheats  Tiger Woods  ain't no  Tiger Woods  anymore  I'd be a  great spokesman  because you  take a picture  of me without  a shirt  and you put  me there  and you show  girls around  me and you  go look  if this  fuck can  get laid  here  so can  you  look at  me  if you can  tell I'm  a mush  that's a good  ad  if this 
[02:50:30]  fuck  can you  capitalized  fuck  can you  laugh  in a different  font  an angry  red  tilted  font  I'm happy  to run  that out  if you can  find me  a medium  doesn't  lemon  anything  whole business  this guy  what's  cougar life  about  after we  launched  Ashley  Madison  we figured  out that  we have  a great  technology  platform  and more  importantly  the world  doesn't work  the way  that corporate  America  wants you  to believe  it works  the road  less traveled  it's traveled  a hell of a lot  more than  people want  to realize 
[02:51:00]  some people  are interested  in dating  girls  covering tattoos  some people  are interested  in dating  younger men  that make  them feel  better after  their divorce  whatever it  ends up  being  nobody  seems to  want to  attach that  marketplace  or talk  to that  marketplace  I do  I want  to work  with all  those other  niches  and all  those other  avenues  that America  is moving  in  that's just  the trends  we're seeing  more and more  older women  dating younger  guys  why not build  them a site  of their own  and see  what happens  and so  CougarLife.com  is wildly  successful  I'm really  proud of it 
[02:51:30]  and when I  get backlash  against that  I just have  to laugh  I just have  to think  people like  Facebook  who won't  take a  CougarLife  ad  they got  their head  up their ass  why?  300 grand  of my money  when we finally  got a campaign  going that was  working  they then came  back and said  you know  the word  cougar  it's so  offensive  we're not  going to  take your  ads  why is it  offensive?  that's  offensive?  Cougars  call themselves  Cougars  with Courtney  Cox attached  on ABC  it's kind  of like  the Desperate  House  where  there's  the name  of that  show?  Cougar Town  it is  right  they took 
[02:52:00]  your money  my whole  feeling on  that is  I think  that there's  always in  these companies  that are  breaking  through  they call  themselves  policy  groups  these are  people  who seem  to think  that their  job  is to  moralize  all the  time  these  companies  are in  business  just let  them run  their  business  it's  ridiculous  it doesn't  happen here  it's serious  you guys  love me  and I  appreciate  all the  effort  why do  you think  guys cheat  and not  just go  and get  a divorce  and make  it easy  for themselves  is it a thrill  thing or something  no I don't 
[02:52:30]  I think  they do  cherish  their partner  they love  their kids  their economic  situation  and I say  if a good  friend came  to me  my brother  if anyone  came to me  and said  hey I'm  in this  situation  I didn't  sign up  to be a  priest  I didn't  want to  be celibate  for the  last six  months  it just  hasn't  been  happening  I would  say  why don't  you get  something  on the  side  and see  if that  doesn't  get you  through the  night  and we  have learned  over the  years  that the  divorce  thing  is just  out of  control  as far  as what  happens  to the  men  they can't  afford to  get divorced 
[02:53:00]  a lot  of times  well I  think  that we've  seen a big  trend  in that  right  Ashley  Madison  is not  only  recession  proof  it's  like  recession  growth  and I  think  that's  been  fueled  by a  couple  things  you  couldn't  value  your  home  how  the  hell  are you  supposed  to get  out of  your  marriage  so you're  definitely  going to  play around  now  because it's  de facto  over  but you  couldn't  physically  get out  of it  because you  economically  couldn't  achieve it  and then  really  there's a  direct  correlation  between  how  unfaithful  people are  and unemployment  rates  when you're  feeling down  about yourself  you're not  working  that's when  you need  your partner  the most  sometimes  that's  when you  get them  the least  that's  when you  need  your dick  sucked  plus you  have more 
[02:53:30]  time  because you're  not working  so you can  still get  laid  that's the  other phenomenon  out there  truthfully  it's about  the ubiquitous  of adult  content  there's so  many guys  on there  watching  all these  tube sites  and they  genuinely  believe  that their  neighbor  is getting  all this  they're  getting  oral  anal  they're  getting  all this  and I'm  not in  threesomes  I've never  had a  threesome  they think  they're  missing  the boat  right  and so  we see  a lot  of that  guys  who are  signing  up  they love  their  partner  but they  wouldn't even  ask their  partner  to do  those kinds  of sexual  things  they're  looking for  sexual  variants  they're  looking for  that oral  sex  they just  don't get 
[02:54:00]  it home  do you  worry  I was asking  his wife  do you  worry  you have to  on some  level  because you're  very beautiful  but you have  to worry  my husband's  views of  fidelity are like  this  doesn't it ever  make you  when you're  laying there  going  just that  moment  don't you  ever have  that moment  every job  has its  perks  right  worry about  his  viewpoints  not worry  about them  and go  like  wow  he's  really  he's  kind  of  big  on  infidelity  does it  ever scare  you a little  bit  he loves  it  he doesn't 
[02:54:30]  like  infidelity  he really  loves it  no he's  not going  to cheat  on me  we have  a great  relationship  I mean  I worry  more that  he's out  there  and there's  crazies  that's what  I worry  we have  a family  we have  to protect  ourselves  so that's  more my  concern  but I  mean  some of  the things  he says  are a  little  out  there  and people  don't get  where they  come from  so  misunderstanding  him is  what I  worry about  too  I'm not  going to  I don't want  you to  tell this  personally 
[02:55:00]  but if  you look  at her  and you  you're not  going to do  better  you know what I mean  it's like Anthony  and her  you know what I mean  you two guys  have so much  in common  except  you're rich  and he's an  alcoholic  okay  he's rich  he's not  only an  alcoholic  he's also  rich  he's pretty  successful  you know who's  not rich  me and you  Noel is rich  and are both  rich  that's the joke  I say 
[02:55:30]  my wife  can contemplate  those things  but she gets  to do it  in a really  big house  and a really  nice bed  that helps  how many kids  do you have  we have two  good for you  I guess as a  sports agent  if you're making  a percentage  you're probably  doing okay  before that  hey who did  you represent  do you talk  about it  yeah I don't  like to talk  about it  it's not fair  to those guys  what sport  basketball players  oh they are  they are notorious  cheaters  we have  one of our  stories we've  told forever  I don't want  to mention  the player's  name anymore  but somebody  decided to  fuck this  guy over  and give  us all  his cell 
[02:56:00]  phone number  and how  to get  into his  voicemail  and we used  to I can't  believe we got  away with this  this goes  back easily  12-14 years  we used to  play all  his voicemails  this guy  had women  in every  single city  and they all  thought they  were the only  one  it was  unbelievable  it's not just  that guy  it's every  athlete  I don't think  I represented  one that  didn't behave  like that  and you know  what it's about  I don't want  to sit there  and say that  these guys  are just  these world  class  flanders  it's also  like anything  in life  temptation  we underestimate  how well  we can resist  it  if you put  a bunch  of great 
[02:56:30]  food in  front of me  I can sit  there and  say oh  I'm on  diet  but I'm  going to  probably  end up  eating  half  of it  these guys  are  I remember  one time  this woman  came out  she was hot  but she wanted  to be this  player  but I knew  he was looking  for something  a little different  she said no  not for me  for my daughter  she was trying  to broker her  daughter to this  guy  their 18 year old  daughter  people throw  themselves at  these guys  all day long  I did that  for crack  I heard the  Lakers  would have an  area under  the stadium  or under  the arena  where they  would get  blown  during  halftime  I don't know 
[02:57:00]  about that  somebody I know  who worked  for them  told me that  big game  James  James Worthy  come on  get busted  what was it  in Seattle  we've all seen  the numbers  that Wilt  and Magic  and all those  guys talked  about  they clearly  had to pursue  this as almost  a career path  to do those  kinds of  Kareem couldn't  have cheated  though  come on  he was all  Muslim  and religious  I hope Kareem  I would be  heartbroken  if Kareem  was fucking  but the point  is it's not  just athletes  and politicians  and celebrities  I gotta tell you  it's your buddy  in the cubicle  next to you  the guy at the 
[02:57:30]  ball game  whatever  infidelity  really  my numbers  and I think  I'm probably  more accurate  than the research  you're gonna  come across  it's probably  70% of guys  out there  cheat  wow  what percentage  of women  I think about  50  about half  hey are you  gonna start  a website  called  ATM.com  I just ask you  to drop  your money  I have  people that  are into  that was  a major  fucking  bomb  explain it  again  my finger 
[02:58:00]  fell on it  my finger  fell on it  do you ever  go to  Fort Lauderdale  because next  week I'm at  National Lampoon  Comedy Club  in Fort Lauderdale  I'm in Fort Lauderdale  next week  myself  are you  next week  do you want  a nice empty  room to hang  out in  okay  that's the  reason people  are coming  it was very  funny  next weekend  I'll be there  established men  is that more  for like  that's a  sugar daddy  I was just 
[02:58:30]  going to say  that  yeah sugar daddy  is good  you know  one of the  things we found  about the  sugar daddy  sites is that  they have more  women than men  that's always  interested me  that women  gravitate to her  and so  you can call  it veiled  prostitution  you can call  it people  who want  to live  a certain  lifestyle  these are  women who  are basically  saying  hey  if you're  made of  this  and you want  to spend  your money  on having  a great  girl around  you  I want  to be  your arm  candy  and so  guys love  that site  how does  that site  work  in the  thing  now  you go  there  do you  have  to  prove  your  an 
[02:59:00]  established  man  in my  mind  is a guy  who's  just  willing  to spend  money  on a  woman  right  so  that  could  just  be  a guy  who's  just  working  really  hard  it's  I tried  to articulate  this other  day  and it  fell flat  on his  face  so maybe  you can  appreciate  this  which is  you know  it's  that  scarface  thing  right  first you  get the  money  then you  get the  power  then you  get the  women  that's  great  if you're  a coke  dealer  but who  the hell  is going  to make  that  you know  that's  not the  road people  are going  to go  so instead  get a  regular job  but if  with your  spare income  you're not  going to go  play  warcraft  or some  stupid  video game  but spend  that money 
[02:59:30]  on women  then you know  I think  women will  saddle up to  you  that's a good  look at it  I think  women that  are going  for that  looking for  somebody  that's worth  a million  to really  take care  of them  any hot  girl  or decent  girl can  have somebody  buy them  dinner  it all  depends  it's all  relative  I think  the girls  that are  looking for  millionaires  are of a  certain type  but then you  get like  you know  some fucking  skank from  Ronkonkoma  Long Island  you know  you only got to  have a few  bucks in a car  that runs  when I watch  Jersey Shore 
[03:00:00]  I'm also sure  they're looking  for millionaires  right  I think  there's definitely  those girls  out there  they're all  running around  Vegas  and those  are those  ones  that saddle up  red lobster  in there  I think  you're talking  about women  who basically  want to sit  they want  to be put  on a pedestal  they want  to get  some jewelry  all that  kind of stuff  and I think  an average  guy can do  that for them  for sure  did you set  this whole  thing up  so she didn't  think you  were cheating  she caught  you  and was like  no man  I'm doing  research  for my new  company  I spent  20 million  dollars  on TV  all to cover 
[03:00:30]  my tracks  it's a  it's a giant  you seem  angry about  this  Ashley Madison  website  no not at  all  you actually  explained yourself  perfectly  the establishment  not at all  I'm making  jokes  would the NBA  take your ads  we've run  some NBA  ads  it depends  the biggest  kibosh  we've gotten  is from the  NFL  for the  Super Bowl  ad  ESPN  pulled their  ad  they're owned  by ABC  owned by  Disney  we're a  family network  that's fiction  right  it's okay  in fiction  it's not okay 
[03:01:00]  in reality  established men  can pick up  where Craigslist  left off  let's be honest  Craigslist  removing the  erotic section  left a lot  of us  basically with  our hands  out in the  middle of  the field  going what  now God  I think  Craigslist  mistake there  if I had to  is just  they refused  to police  it on any  level  so if  you have  underage  girls  and you  have  all this  stuff  going  it's  probably  problematic  and all  they needed  was one  bad  incident  which they  got  right  they got  this  murder  but the  point is  again  you're  trying to  blame  a website  as if  somehow 
[03:01:30]  in every  city  so I just  got back  from Germany  Austria  Switzerland  we launched  over there  you don't  think that  in every  city  and every  country  I've been  to  there's  not brothels  all over  the place  there's  not an  equivalent  of Craigslist  it's just  again we're  sticking our  heads in the  sands  as if  these women  and men  aren't  trying to  connect  and  more importantly  you speak  to any  woman  running  these  brothels  90%  of the  guys  going  there  these  aren't  single  the FBI  would bust  these  fucking  pedos 
[03:02:00]  in chat  rooms  they didn't  shut  AOL  down  that was  the old  AOL  not the  new  AOL  that we  have  copied  for  laying  around  here  somewhere  Jimmy  but I'm  saying  another  fine  sponsors  great  AOL  we love  them  I don't  dislike  AOL  the point  I have  AOL  the point  I'm making  is  I'm annoyed  that those  chat rooms  run around  what if  you called  Verizon  and said  hey  this  prostitute  spoke to  this  guy  and went  bad  I have 
[03:02:30]  said that  they won't  get my  money back  for me  it's ridiculous  to always  blame these  inanimate  objects  for human  behaviors  to blame  Ashley  Madison  for an  affair  happening  well then  Craig's  the mistake  they made  was also  they began  buckling  and they  began  policing  which again  just made  people push  more  but they're  also right  weren't they  saying  we'll take  that link  away  but you'll  see people  are just  going to  post it  in the  auto  section  come and  get this  car  and a  blowjob  I love  craigslist 
[03:03:00]  I could  buy golf  clubs  and look  at cock  at the  same time  oh wow  chat roulette  have you ever  seen that  chat roulette  no but I  have the  chat roulette  I have not  it's basically  a wank fest  oh really  a wank fest  as long as  it's all these  guys jerking  to try and  hope that  some girl  is going to  watch them  jerk off  that was  called pal  talk  on the  iphone  they have  that  there's  that one  program  the app  that they 
[03:03:30]  yanked  you weren't  here  oh bob  kelly  turned us  on  we were  using it  in fucking  I have  my chick  looking  and then  every time  some guy  would start  looking  I would  just poke  my fucking  stupid  fat face  and kill  his heart  on  take it  away  oh they  stopped  that app  why wouldn't  they  it was  fun  keep  angry  birds  going  there's  an example  I've been  trying to get  as an app  the scarlet  letter app  whatever  again these  platforms  are so  puritanical
