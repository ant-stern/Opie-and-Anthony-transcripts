<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts mercilessly mocking a dreadful Journey cover band recording, focusing on the singer's horrifically off-key vocals and comparing it to Steve Perry's masterful performances.  Their commentary was laced with vulgar language and speculation about the singer's vocal problems.  Despite the abysmal quality, they found the singer’s surprising popularity baffling.

Former New York Rangers goalie Mike Richter then joined the show.  The conversation covered his career, including anecdotes about  fan interactions (ranging from enthusiastic cheers to obscene and bizarre comments targeting his family and anatomy), the intensity of Rangers-Islanders games, and the brutal physical and mental toll of playing professional hockey.  He detailed past injuries – a fractured skull, knee injuries, and concussions –  shared stories from his childhood playing street hockey, his post-retirement life at Yale, and the challenges of adjusting to life after professional sports. Richter also promoted a future Q&A event with other former Rangers players.  Callers shared their own Rangers experiences, including a touching father-son story. The discussion touched on hockey fights, rink sizes, the college-to-pro transition, and the overall physical and mental demands of the sport, as well as the impact of social media on athletes and the evolving athlete-press dynamic.

The conversation then pivoted to the aftermath of the Tracy Morgan bus accident, including discussion of Morgan's and Artie Lange's injuries and the ethical implications of TMZ releasing graphic footage. A hospital employee caller revealed a nurse was fired for posting a picture of Tracy Morgan online. This led to a broader critique of the NYC VA, its long wait times for veterans, contrasting this with the readily available care for illegal immigrants and the perceived disproportionate resources devoted to Guantanamo Bay detainees.  John Kerry's performance as Secretary of State and the lack of action regarding a jailed Marine in Mexico were criticized, as was the increase in NYC shootings under Mayor de Blasio, attributed to the end of "stop and frisk" and decreased police cooperation from residents in high-crime areas. The segment ended with an "I told you so" moment regarding Donald Sterling's refusal to sell the Los Angeles Clippers.

A caller, "Di," expressed concern for Tracy Morgan, sparking a heated exchange with the hosts due to their dismissive and sarcastic responses and her perceived interruption. The conversation veered into the Clintons' post-White House finances, with the hosts expressing skepticism about claims of financial hardship.  While a Willie Nelson guest appearance was teased, it fell through due to Nelson's fatigue. The segment continued with tangents including a caller's encounter with Robert Costanzo, a detailed recounting of the O.J. Simpson trial and chase, discussions of Hillary Clinton's speeches and finances (including played audio clips), and harsh criticism of PSY and Snoop Dogg's new song, "Hangover."

The show proceeded with jokes about *Game of Thrones*' Unsullied and their implied lack of genitalia. This transitioned into a discussion of Snoop Dogg’s “Move Bitch,” its lyrics and origins, followed by a Snoop Dogg and Willie Nelson collaboration, which the hosts debated regarding its lyrical content and possible drug references.  A new Godsmack song was then played and critiqued.  A significant portion focused on the changing music industry and Spotify's impact on artists' income, stemming from one host's conversation with a local musician. This expanded into a broader discussion of evolving music consumption and the decline of traditional radio for younger audiences.  The segment concluded with a lengthy discussion of a news story involving a woman assaulting a 17-year-old boy, filmed by the boy using a drone and his phone.  Hosts expressed varying opinions, ranging from humor to anger and disbelief.  The discussion ended with speculation on the rising frequency of mass shootings and their motivations, referencing a recent incident in North Hollywood.

The final segment focused on drones, their capabilities, and potential misuse, including humorous scenarios involving surveillance and voyeurism between ex-lovers.  The discussion shifted to Deer Trail, Colorado, and their resolution allowing residents to shoot down drones, leading to jokes about the town’s size.  This led to a comparison of marijuana legalization in one Colorado town versus prohibition in another, with commentary on the sheriff's outdated views and a crude discussion of the purported psychological effects of marijuana contrasted with blowjobs while high.  Further tangents included the phrasing of intimate questions, a comedic legal scenario about the use of “huh” in a sexual context,  poor posture and back problems, personal anecdotes about weight loss, and interactions with celebrities at the High Times Awards.  Opinions on reality TV, specifically the authenticity of "Catfish," and the willingness of people to participate in staged scenarios were expressed. Numerous SiriusXM ad reads were interspersed throughout, including Father's Day specials, comedy shows, pharmaceuticals, business loans, credit repair, and car dealerships.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  lights  home and  that's  no all the songs are high but  they tuned down well but i don't know i forget that the the two songs that he  sang the first night i didn't know i'm not a huge journey fan but they were  like uh... songs that uh... thirty three-year-old really wills in the sky  uh... bring bring bring bring anywhere you want to know when they wasn't  what are some of those other jury songs we go why don't you go away forward i 
[00:00:30]  don't know on the video until he starts singing some journey i'll start right  there fuck it no no no it's sky babbles rambles on and on this guy because it  didn't feel right didn't feel right and then he sings an eel song all right we  can fast forward a little bit go halfway through the video halfway yeah go  ahead 
[00:01:00]  oh  oh  this is a journey song yes it is yeah going  this is open arms right yeah almost not recognizable  oh my god this stinks  he hit his voice a shot  well the band is not doing it well either  oh maybe they are  this was me and my girls song in college 
[00:01:30]  so we had a long distance thing going on so  open arms was our song  how did that work  if you're uh...  well it turned into open relationship  well i think she might have went back with her old boyfriend for the summer and i never got over it  she's the one i try to look up but she's she's hiding out there i want to see what what she has become all these years later 
[00:02:00]  but this was our song  oh  he's  it's not that nice high  very raspy  oh stop  he's looking out into the audience doing his steve perry stuff  yeah that was this is not a big  event  no the eels in 2014 i don't think they 
[00:02:30]  this is 19 years old  he must hate watching cover bands like do just him to a tee  killing it right  yeah  yeah and i can't imagine like you said most eels fans probably aren't huge journey fans  i don't know i think  people in general are journey fans  but across the boards one's this  it's na na na na na na na na na  jeez he can't kick it up 
[00:03:00]  loving  touching  this is like the way someone was singing karaoke  because he's uh  can't hit the nose  and guaranteed he puts the fucking mic to the audience  because he doesn't want to do it 
[00:03:30]  his timing's way off too right  yeah he's trying to like  yeah he's trying to do one of those things  re  imagining  a very weak voice  you know that this sounds good  oh my god it's horrible  you're tearing me apart  you're tearing me apart  you're tearing me apart  holy  oh 
[00:04:00]  they're  laughs  oh  no i'm not  what happened  is  Oh, my God.  Yeah. 
[00:04:30]  Find Love & Touch in 1979 or something.  Is it better than this?  Find, like, I want to hear Old Journey.  Yeah, there he goes.  You're right.  Look at this audience.  It's like, where are the eels?  Come for the eels.  We heard enough.  Go to, yeah, Journey in their prime.  Find Journey from, like,  Journey, Love & Touch.  Listen how amazing this guy's voice used to be.  That's kind of sad, actually.  It is.  You got Tokyo 1981?  Yeah. 
[00:05:00]  Oh, yeah, that's right in the wheelhouse.  That's when the song came out.  Somewhere around there.  Oh, boy.  This is what happens.  81?  Oh, no.  See, it's all high.  Oh, that's a shame. 
[00:05:30]  Effortless, right?  Oh, yeah.  You could do all those little inflections.  I think that's a good song.  Love & Touch & Squeezing.  Fuck you.  You know, like, love & touch & squeezing.  That's a shitty sentiment, that is.  That's the loving part.  Exactly.  Touching & Squeezing.  That's a good...  That's fucking out of the way.  That's terrible.  That's just a terrible...  Shutting out the hubbub of the world.  Oh, fuck.  I can eat my balls. 
[00:06:00]  Hubbub.  See, there he goes.  Just terrible audio quality, by the way, 81.  Yeah.  Listen to the fucking notes he's hitting on.  All just crystal clear, too.  Now he goes a little higher.  Oh, this is old.  Jeez.  I don't keep up late.  The dry ice smoke.  Yeah. 
[00:06:30]  Wow.  Time just stinks on ice.  Yeah, but what happened with him?  Because there's a lot of singers that could kind of keep it going.  Some can, some can't.  I know 19 years later, whatever it was, you're not going to get your voice as high, but he  just looks really awkward and doesn't sound good at all on any level.  No, he's all bleh, bleh.  You would think he was professional enough to figure out a better way to sing that song  nowadays, but...  Sometimes your body just ages and your fucking voice goes to shit. 
[00:07:00]  Sometimes you don't take care of it goes to shit.  But he had some real issue, I think.  Yeah, I think he had polyps.  Some polyps.  Some of those polyps.  Throat polyps.  Throat bitch.  Polyps.  Yeah, because that's, it should be better than that.  Yeah.  Damn.  It ended, I heard it ended one of his relationships.  Really?  Polyps.  They were arguing and the girl said something about, at least I'm not polypy.  Just made that.  That's not what you did.  Weak joke.  You know what you got to do, really? 
[00:07:30]  It's a joke.  No, I should say, yes.  Weak, serious statement that in my mind I thought might be humorous and I realized was  very bad judgment error as it came out.  Sam, one more thing.  Do open arms with the new Journey singer.  Oh, there you go.  And this will be less than a year old.  Yeah.  Steve Perry probably is close to hanging himself.  Yeah.  Damn.  There you go.  Open arms on, no, do the TV one. 
[00:08:00]  Three down.  Oh.  Yeah, this is from like, D'Ophra or something like that.  And Neil Sean could still, you know, just play because that's all he's doing.  Here we go.  Here we go. 
[00:08:30]  This is life.  Till the sun shines on your day.  Oh, I want to be there again in my city.  Oh, Steve Perry just must hate him.  Oh, my God.  He's from the Philippines.  He don't even have to pay him much.  No, a couple of pennies a week, $100 a show, and he's like 35 cents a day.  He's rich. 
[00:09:00]  For his village.  That documentary is on Netflix, by the way.  I loved it.  The journey.  Don't stop believing.  I loved it.  Steve Perry must be like, what the fuck is with these fans?  How loyal are they, huh?  None loyal.  They don't give a fuck.  He's not there.  Zero loyalty.  Well, there's a time they probably wait around for him, but he never came back.  I think the story also has a lot to do with, I don't think people would be as interested  if it was just some, you know, can they know he's just some regular guy?  Yeah. 
[00:09:30]  Regular Joe.  Yeah, he's got a great story.  Yeah.  It's the regular Joe of the Philippines.  You know, Sean discovered him on YouTube.  Yeah.  That's a crazy story.  And then they're playing sold-out arenas all over the world.  What the hell is this?  A concerto?  A piano.  The beginning of open arms, I bet.  Pulling around a little bit.  Oh, show off.  Yeah, exactly.  I hate when this happens in concerts.  He's doing this with his feet, though.  It's pretty impressive.  Oh. 
[00:10:00]  I'll go to the Met if I want to hear this shit.  Yeah, right?  I just would go to the Met.  Play the journey songs.  All right, this is the one.  Try it again, you dumb rabbit!  Oh, there it was.  Oh, there it was.  Oh, no. 
[00:10:30]  Oh, boy.  It's just the kid from the Philippines.  It replaces you.  Pops right in there, and you're done-ski.  Oh, boy.  I could never be so blind.  Oh, boy.  It's incredible.  Oh, boy. 
[00:11:00]  Oh, boy.  That's sad.  Yeah.  Cue up a gunshot.  Cue up a gunshot.  Right?  So now I'm back to you.  No, it was never been to me when I say.  It was just fucking killing himself.  You got Steve Perry still queued up? 
[00:11:30]  Can you go back to the Steve Perry?  It's Steve Perry.  Just queued up real fast.  Where is he?  Where is he?  Let's hear his open arms.  Well, now you got to-  You got to go way, way in.  Oh, boy.  All right.  Way in.  Oh, no.  All right.  Why is this a different version of-  I only hear it all.  This is nice.  Oh.  What happened to the one we were listening to?  Oh, man.  I just want to go back and forth quickly.  Not a big fan of the tabs, are you? 
[00:12:00]  New window?  Tabs?  Not a tab guy.  Not a tab guy, Sam?  What are you, a Pepsi guy?  Maybe on your show you do the no tabs.  Oh, Jesus.  Wow.  Hold on a second.  I have a fresca impression.  Oh, here he is.  Oh, this is sad. 
[00:12:30]  I'm wanting to hold you.  Who are you here?  How much I'm wanting you.  Oh.  But now let me go.  Come back.  All right.  Now go back to the new kid. 
[00:13:00]  It's just not fair.  It's not fair.  This is like somebody moves in next door and does the 50-gallon drum challenge.  And has fucking girls fucking themselves in there and rules.  Yeah.  Oof.  All right.  Go back to Steve Perry now, please. 
[00:13:30]  Yes.  Oh, no.  Oh, that's so sad.  I have to go back for him.  Yeah, that sucks.  Life just sucks.  That's why lead singers are always flaky, man.  Yeah.  Steve Perry is giving it his all.  Yeah.  Oh, he is.  This is going to go viral.  I bet you this took him a fucking lot to get up there. 
[00:14:00]  It's because people are probably like, I'm telling you, you sound good.  Yeah, it does.  I don't know.  It's been too long.  He's been practicing in the basement or whatever.  Whoa, babe.  Are you ready?  All right.  Back to the new kid.  New kid.  Poor Steve Perry.  Oh, God.  I saw a younger man with a small genital stopping at your head.  Oh, boy. 
[00:14:30]  Nothing but fucking power and right on key.  Crazy.  Oh, man. 
[00:15:00]  That's sad.  Yeah.  One more Steve Perry, please.  We'll land with Steve Perry because he's the originator here.  Please.  Oh, that's...  Oh, that's the other song.  Oh, boy.  That's not nice.  The second night that he did this with the Eels, he did the same two songs.  Oh, really?  Which leads me to believe that these are the two that he's really comfortable with.  That he's comfy with.  That he practiced a lot.  That's not nice.  Refrigerator Perry sings better. 
[00:15:30]  Oh, boy.  That's just mean.  Super Bowl Shuffle.  Does it lead you to believe that this wasn't in an impromptu at all?  No.  That this was planned a long time in advance?  Oh, I can nail these two.  I will practice these two songs.  I missed it.  Yeah.  I'm ready.  People are going to go bananas when I come back.  And it was in two different cities, which means that he's kind of following the Eels around.  Oh, no.  For some stage time.  And by the way, we know the drummer sounds really good as a lead singer for Journey as 
[00:16:00]  well.  He's great.  What is it?  He does Mother Father.  And it's amazing.  Oh, fuck.  I forgot his name.  Shit.  I just know all the members of Journey.  Italian guy, right?  Fuck.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Dean.  Castranova.  Castranova.  Yeah, there it is.  Okay.  Dean Castranova.  He sings even, he sings better than Steve Carey as well.  He does Mother Father and it's fucking like crazy. 
[00:16:30]  Can you play Mother Father?  This was the drummer.  Yes, with the Dean.  They almost went with Dean and then found the Filipino kid.  Yeah.  Because Dean could pull it off as well.  But you need a front man.  You can't have the drummer singer thing going.  It's not.  So maybe they tried it out front and it just didn't look right or something.  Because this guy's insane.  He's really good.  Yeah.  And he's going to be playing drums, too. 
[00:17:00]  Did he sing the song originally?  No, Steve Perry did.  Positive?  Yeah.  So one day he was like, guys, I think I can give it a shot.  Yeah.  This wasn't a radio song. 
[00:17:30]  What a known song by Journey.  Yeah.  I can't imagine singing and drumming at the same time.  Oh, God, no.  I can't imagine doing either of those things.  That's crazy.  I can't imagine sitting and playing the bass.  Drummers are the other ones.  Their shelf life is just fucking brutal.  Yeah.  Because of their arms.  He's fucking goddamn good. 
[00:18:00]  And that's a very high song.  Amazing.  Jesus.  Steve Perry's just like, geez, I thought I was fucking, you know.  Right.  I guess everyone could just do this.  Was there rumors?  Except me.  I think there were rumors he was difficult, too.  Yes.  Because then he stepped out.  I don't think there's rumors.  He stepped out as a solo guy.  Yeah.  Left his guys behind.  How'd he do as a solo?  Really good for about a year or two.  What was a big solo song for him?  Oh, Cherie. 
[00:18:30]  Oh, yeah.  I think I...  Oh, Cherie.  No, no.  I remember that song.  I hate it.  And he had some MTV play.  He had about two or three, I think, on his own, right?  Maybe?  Yeah.  But he got an album out of it, and he was doing well.  And then, boom, out of nowhere, he was done.  Oh, God.  I remember this one.  Oh, boy.  This was huge, though.  It came out.  Oh, yeah.  Steve Perry, his solo.  Which just sounds like Journey. 
[00:19:00]  But he liked the slow ballads.  You should have been gone, knowing how...  Oh, Jesus.  Made you feel that I should have been gone.  I would love to hear him try to sing this one now.  Should have been gone.  Lily.  Marilyn.  Marilyn.  Should have been gone.  Should have been gone.  Yeah, this was a biggie back in... 
[00:19:30]  What was that?  87?  88?  It wasn't a bad song for the time.  Man, it was...  It's kind of dated now, I guess.  It was what everybody was trying to do.  Pretty much sounds like a Journey song.  Yeah.  Just missing a little guitar in there.  John in Rochester.  Good morning, guys.  How's it going?  Hey, John.  Hey, man.  Hi, John.  If you go to YouTube and pull up The Search is Over by the Zoo, which is the Arnald Panetta,  the dude that's singing for a journey right now. 
[00:20:00]  Right.  He sounded like a lot of different people.  It's crazy, man.  He sounds like it's...  You could have been listening to Survivor, but it was him singing in a Philippine bar.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  I've seen all those videos.  Jesus.  A lot of them are part of the documentary that's on Netflix now.  But, yeah, his band was called The Zoo.  You said that, right?  Yeah.  Or Zoo.  Right.  And I think he sounds pretty good as Axl.  Do the Survivor one up top.  Let me see this. 
[00:20:30]  2007?  Is this like the shit that Neil Sean saw?  Neil Sean said he was just on YouTube in the middle of the night, and he was kind of checking  out Journey clips and this and that, and this kid popped up.  Oh, fuck.  Mike Richter is finally here.  Oh.  We could do this later, I guess, right?  I'm going to ask him how old he was when he started pucking.  Oh, God.  Mike Richter from the 94 team that won the Stanley Cup. 
[00:21:00]  Yeah.  Oh, come on right in.  Why not?  We say.  What's up, Mike?  How you doing, sir?  Hey, Mike.  All right.  Welcome aboard.  Nice.  Thanks for having me, man.  Take a seat.  Man, the Rangers aren't going to win the Stanley Cup.  How much does this suck?  Oh, man.  Hey, hey.  How much does this suck?  Early for that kind of talk.  Exactly.  How much does this suck?  Exactly.  Oh, B.  Getting their asses kicked.  Slow down.  Getting their asses handed to them by the LA Kings. 
[00:21:30]  Rewind here.  Slow down.  It doesn't suck if you're not in the final.  And these guys have worked their ass off to get here.  So, I mean, they should be proud.  And, look, they've lost by just inches in these games.  Oh, yeah.  It could go either way.  And LA knows that.  And, you know, I'm a Ranger fan.  I'm a bit of a homer.  But I do think they'll win Wednesday.  This is a very, very good team.  Sometimes it's tough to come back and play at home.  There's different expectations.  You see them in the power play.  But, look, Kings know it's not going to get over in a hurry.  I don't think these guys are going to roll over and die. 
[00:22:00]  There's too much character on both sides.  But, in the end, the Kings will be hoisting the cup.  Jesus.  I'm not going that.  I'm not conceding that.  No, not at all.  It's too bad.  And then it's going to hurt a lot more next year,  knowing they were in the finals and then didn't win.  No, no, no, no.  First of all, I saw these Rangers are still playing.  And 28 other teams can't say that.  And I'll tell you this.  They've played really well.  What do you mean?  My team?  The Islanders?  The New York Islanders?  See, that's what his problem is.  I think we've seen the root of the problem here. 
[00:22:30]  Right, exactly.  We had a great chant until you guys won in 94.  I know, that really hurts.  We had a wonderful chant that you had to ruin.  How old were you when you started pucking?  Actually, I grew up in Philly about six years old.  I was playing older brothers, playing street hockey mostly.  You know, the Flyers then were winning Stanley Cups.  They were one of the better teams in the league.  Sure.  That's who you followed, and that's what you wanted to do as an athlete.  Are you a Flyers fan, though?  I still kind of am, you know.  I mean, I learned to hate them when I played against them.  Right. 
[00:23:00]  Easy enough to do, but it's a great, you know, you look at New York, Boston, Philly.  There's some great sports teams there from, you know, each of the sports.  Right.  Football, baseball, basketball.  So, yeah, you grew up kind of bleeding their colors, and the minute you're drafted by the Rangers, that becomes your place.  Sure.  And I didn't realize how much I'd end up loving this place until you live here.  And then you get to know the people that you assumed were, you know, horrible and everything else.  People love to hate New York, because most of the people have never had experience there.  Yeah, yeah.  And then they turn you back on Philly. 
[00:23:30]  That's wonderful.  As quick as you can.  Because they're not giving you the big paycheck.  You know, the first time you get a beer poured on your head as you're entering the stadium, you say, you know, I actually like New York a little bit more now.  Wow.  As soon as you cash that check, you're like, Philly ho.  Had never heard of them.  How the hell does a goalie block 35 shots on goal, 36 shots on goal like that, like Quick did last night?  No, I always say whenever I won, I played a great game, and when we lost, we didn't play well.  No, it's a little joke. 
[00:24:00]  Yeah.  Honestly, I look at those games now, and the players are so good.  They're so big.  In every sport, they've gotten bigger, stronger, faster.  And in hockey, I think it's the best competition you're seeing ever.  And I don't think there's a position that's really improved more than goaltending.  The guys are bigger and stronger and faster.  You saw how good Mike Crick was.  But, I mean, Lundqvist has been on this all year.  In fact, from the moment he stepped on the ice at Madison Square, you know, eight years ago, he's been amazing.  When you see old footage of hockey games from, let's say, the 80s, mid-80s, let's say, it almost looks like a joke how different the game is now. 
[00:24:30]  We had training camp one year in Vermont, and guys were looking at replays.  There's ESPN throwbacks, and they had all these classic games.  And they showed Edmonton Oilers, who were the fastest team in the NHL of their time, and they're playing, I guess, the Islanders.  And the Islanders had an unbelievable, tough, fast team.  And we're looking at this, and it was just kind of quiet for a while.  And finally, I think it was Tony Amante, a young, brash guy from Boston.  Great guy.  He's like, this is horrible.  He did it.  That's great.  And Madison's going, wait a minute. 
[00:25:00]  Whoa, that's our championship team.  But, you know, the difference in just that decade made so much.  And I would say, it leapfrogged again.  Go look at the 94.  There's a lot of tough guys great play.  Sure.  But these dudes on the ice right now are really good.  There was a time you were able to actually hold the puck for a split, you know, a second, two seconds even.  But, you know, I think.  No, you cannot.  You can't.  You can't do that.  I had my son at the game last night.  Amazing.  Watch the decisions.  And same thing with quarterback.  Anything.  You get the ball in basketball.  You run a pass pattern in football. 
[00:25:30]  You receive the puck in hockey.  I don't know how the guys score.  I play men's league now.  I'm a crappy defenseman, you know.  But I go down and I look at these high school goalies that drop to the knees.  They take away the bottom part of the net.  There's nowhere to go.  And you forget the forwards.  You get the puck off your stick or else you're going to be plastered.  Right.  So they make decisions immediately.  It's awesome to watch.  But you still play.  I still do, yeah.  I love the game.  What league?  There's no league.  I play pond hockey.  I play pick up men's league.  Oh, you just fool around a little bit.  You just fool around.  You look like you're in great shape still.  All right, yeah.  But I'm not getting any faster, I'll tell you.  Right. 
[00:26:00]  The agility of goalies these days is amazing.  They're big guys.  All that gear.  And yet just laying into a complete split on the ice like that.  They had some of the old time.  I love the old garden pictures and whatnot they have up there.  And the garden vision between periods.  And they showed pictures of Gump Worsley.  And, you know, as it goes back, I mean, I'm looking at pictures when I came in.  It's old.  And the players weren't as conditioned as they are now.  And hockey's been of the top four sports.  Sure. 
[00:26:30]  Lagging behind.  And it's not so much anymore.  I mean, the Europeans come in here.  You know, the old Soviet system.  These guys were well-conditioned.  And now everybody has to be.  You'll lose your job.  I must break you.  I must break you.  Bill, if you look at the old goalies, there's always kind of like the big, chunky guy that  couldn't play out.  All right.  All right.  He'll fill it up.  Billy Smith?  Billy Smith?  Are we talking about him?  Billy was.  Billy kind of.  He had his foot in both worlds.  He was a great player.  He was an ugly player.  He won up, you know.  That's why I loved him so much.  He loved throwing. 
[00:27:00]  Boy, did he.  Oh, man.  Yeah, no problem slashing you.  You got in that crease.  You were getting a big glove in your face.  Or a stick across the end.  He didn't care.  Oh, he loved sweeping that stick back behind the neck.  He was a money goalie, right?  I mean, he would just come through in the clutch all the time.  Big drinker, too.  Oh, yeah.  All goalies has to be.  I used to caddy for him.  That's how you get by.  For real, I did.  That's how you get by.  I was just a kid caddying for all those guys when they were in all the cups.  The secret of goaltending right there.  That sort of makes the knee injuries a little easier. 
[00:27:30]  But that's when the game was different.  If a goalie left to crease, he got just hammered.  Well, if you look at those old films, we can laugh about the speed of those games in the 80s.  These guys were tough.  I mean, they were tough.  All of them.  If you look back, it's just a different era.  Someone would break their nose.  I have to say, there is a kind of code of ethics in hockey where you just go, look, you're not going to be griping about it.  You're going to put your nose back on and go out and play.  I think there's a lot of pride in that.  How many broken bones did you suffer? 
[00:28:00]  My first broken bone was my second pinky toe from my pinky.  I stepped on the skate in college.  And I cried a little bit, but I got through it.  Goaltenders are allowed to cry.  No, I actually didn't break many bones.  I blew up both knees, shoulder injuries, and ended up with a fractured skull.  Right, right.  I began with a bad toe and ended up with a broken skull.  Yeah, what was that, a knee, right?  You took a knee?  A knee took it out.  It was a slap shot that originally went through my ear hole, if you can believe this.  It's the craziest thing.  It was my own fault.  I kind of twisted a little bit on a tip shot, and I didn't watch it in, and pop it. 
[00:28:30]  It hit me.  Oh, wow.  That was the beginning of the end.  Was that a concussion, too?  It was a concussion, too.  How many concussions have you?  I think if you ask any athlete, you know, over the course of their career, I mean, falling  out of trees as a kid, you know, getting hit playing football and all through, I couldn't  even count them.  I don't know.  Oh, man.  Any issues because of that?  I could count them, but I can't remember.  That's the issue.  There's an issue.  That's a big issue.  That's why I drink it.  Do you think you had more time if it wasn't for the injury? 
[00:29:00]  I do.  You know, I think the position of goaltending is one of experience, and if your body can hold  up, big if, and which is what makes guys like Brodeur incredible.  I mean, you get experience.  You're better at 35 than you were at 25, but the problem is your body starts breaking  down.  One way or another, you're getting slower, and even the athletes that retire on their  own terms, you know what I mean, quotes, they're not.  They're slowing down.  They realize I'm not what I used to be.  Wayne Gretzky had an amazing thing.  He said, look, I'm still a good player in the NHL, but I can't stand comparing myself  to what I was, and it's kind of depressing. 
[00:29:30]  If you used to score 90 goals and you're only scoring 50 now, 50 is great, but it's half  of what you used to be, and you can't live with that.  Just ask Steve Perry from Journey.  He doesn't sound that good anymore.  No, and at some point, you've got to hang it up, and it's hard to do.  How many years did you play?  I played 14 here in the NHL.  That's a pretty good run, right?  It was fun.  It was amazing.  Man, you know, it's something you do your whole life, and at one point, I think you're  more ready to retire when you're younger than when you're older, because you've become  that thing.  And I retired at 36, and all of a sudden, you're like, whoa. 
[00:30:00]  Now what?  You feel like you're 100 years old, and you are for hockey, but not for life.  So, you know, you've got a lot.  Was it tough to adjust to that?  Hugely tough.  I don't think anybody's prepared for it.  And, you know, I went back to school.  I had left school, University of Wisconsin, as a sophomore, played an Olympic team, minors,  then pros, and, you know, that was my goal.  That was my life.  And, but at the time, I was just starting a young family, so it was a good time to kind  of transition, but you're lost, and it's hard.  And it's good to have, you know, your network. 
[00:30:30]  But I think that's the biggest thing, is every day you're going there.  Where a guy played with Ryan Greshner, a funny guy, you know, here in the Rangers, said,  you know, someone said, what do you miss most about playing?  He said, showering with 20 guys in the morning.  But I mean, his point was, you're this family, and you do everything with them.  You do everything.  They know everything about you, you know everything about them, and it is a family.  And the tighter the team, the more success you have.  And then one day you go, oh, I'm done.  And you're one of those old guys now.  And that's your life, really, from the time you remember anything.  You were probably skating and, you know, playing hockey. 
[00:31:00]  You still play.  I mean, I love the game, but it's a little different.  Was it awkward to go back to the rink at first, or?  Yeah, a little bit, you know, because what you don't want to do.  You would visit, but then they're like, all right.  You know, we're 20 years removed from our Stanley Cup Finals.  You know, our time's over, and it's great to reminisce, but it's the Rangers' time now,  and this is a different team, and they've got different challenges, and it's their time.  So you don't want to, you know, be part of that living in the past thing.  It's almost their time.  Oh, no.  It's almost their time.  They are there.  It's almost their time.  They've earned the right to be there, and it's awesome. 
[00:31:30]  It's brutal.  Hey, I mean, New York.  Yeah, where are the Islanders, though?  Where are they?  I apologize for being in the finals.  You did something really well.  But there has to be that thing, though, when you're down 3-0.  Even though you're there, it's like, I'd be like, God, this sucks.  Like, we know that we're in big trouble.  It's been done one time, right, where they came back in one.  Yeah, someone said that, too.  The momentum changes so fast.  You look at the games that we played, we being the Rangers, played in L.A., right?  Right.  And they were so close.  Those games could do...  Overtime, double overtime.  Right, yeah.  We could be almost three up right now.  Yep.  And I thought coming back here, I think a lot of people had the Rangers underrated, 
[00:32:00]  and I still think they kind of do.  And L.A. is as great as they say they are.  That's a really tough team.  But the Rangers are better than I think people give them credit for.  And they came so close, and you come back home, there's these expectations.  Had they won last night, there'd be a lot of pressure on L.A. to win.  They do not want to go back 2-2.  So the Rangers, I think, will win tomorrow.  And then you just...  That's a big F there, Mike.  It's a huge F.  That's why you play the game.  One game at a time.  I think if you don't get shut out, that'll be a nice thing to take with you.  Jeez.  He's brutal, man. 
[00:32:30]  I don't know, man.  It looks like it's approaching mid-June, and they're still playing.  Hey, you got your Stanley Cup.  He's all right.  He's fine.  Where are the Islanders right about now?  I can't be an Islanders fan and then jump and start rooting for the Rangers.  I give you all the credit in the world.  It's a difficult place you find yourself in life.  And I know my team sucks.  I know that.  Let me say something.  They have major problems.  They have problems.  But look, the Islanders are actually a very good organization.  They have a lot of talent there.  I know some good people there are involved in that.  They have some excellent... 
[00:33:00]  I mean, Tavares is unbelievable.  The injury was really a shame for him last year.  He'll come back.  He's young.  That's a scary team.  And that will change.  I mean, you look at those Edmonton Oilers who end up with a dynasty.  They didn't make the Stanley Cup playoffs the year before they ended up winning.  So it can change.  And that's a good...  Can I ask you something?  I don't really play hockey or do any athletics.  I pucked for a bit when I was a boy.  But what makes you want to...  To me, the goalie seems like the most horrifying place to be.  Because everyone is trying to smash the puck past your face.  And it's like, what makes you decide that's what I want to do? 
[00:33:30]  You know, actually, yes and no.  I think you get a lot of credit.  Sometimes too much when the team wins.  And look, when you lose, it is a team sport.  And it is everybody.  And I think a lot of goalies...  I had two older brothers.  It was a way I could end up playing with them because I wasn't strong enough for a fast enough to play with guys a couple years older than me.  But you can always go in net.  Now you're playing against not your peers, but older guys.  So it helps you develop, I think, a little bit quicker.  I loved it, though.  I mean, you think about this.  As a young kid, what do you want to do?  You want to play.  And goalies didn't have to shift on and off. 
[00:34:00]  I was going to go in on my team for probably the first 15 years of my life.  You go in and you're in.  That's it.  And there's days where you stink.  There's days where you're not getting physically hurt.  But emotionally, it can be disappointing to lose the game and feel like it was on you.  But that's also what kind of compels you to play.  You have the game in your hands.  It's actually fun.  How do you see those slap shots?  That's crazy.  I was thinking the same thing last night.  These guys are so big now.  And they're getting in front of the guys so well.  And a lot of it is you watch somebody like Quick or Lundqvist who are so good about taking away the – they play percentages like anybody else. 
[00:34:30]  We know that a certain percentage, 80% of the goals are scored on the lower half of the net.  Take away the bottom of the net.  These guys are big.  Their feet go almost post-to-post.  It's six feet wide.  It's crazy.  Take away the middle.  You know, last night – I'm reading the paper today.  You know, Lundqvist had, I think, three goals were – two of them were tips.  One was an attempt at pass.  Right.  And it went right back to the guy and slam dunked it.  So three goals and 15 shots doesn't sound good.  He played a great game.  That was a tough game to play.  What are the differences in the pads since – from when you were playing to now? 
[00:35:00]  How much bigger are they now?  You know, Boles were shorter like I am.  And they tried to make the pads wide to cover up a lot of stuff because they stood, you know, kind of upright.  The pads look huge.  Now these guys go down.  And the pads are tall.  And so these guys are amazing.  They, as I said, toe-to-toe, they're post-to-post, and then they close the middle.  It's not easy to score.  The agility is crazy.  And when you watch some of the old games and just watch these guys drop to their knees and kick one leg out.  Unbelievable.  And it's like, no, you don't even see anyone do that anymore.  They instantly can do a ballet split. 
[00:35:30]  And save the rebound.  I mean, these guys are actually pretty soft.  When a guy's coming in and shooting a puck 100 miles an hour, somehow hits the pad and drops, and they have no rebound.  It's crazy.  What kind of a cup are you wearing in that situation?  Seriously.  Tatinia.  I never did.  It really helped me focus.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Yeah, that would.  Get nicked on the helmet.  You'd be praying for one in the head.  That is an all-or-nothing kind of goalie.  You'd be praying for one in the head.  Yeah.  Wow.  It's got to be better than a regular cup.  It is.  It's like a boxing cup.  I mean, it's got to be really big and strong and everything now. 
[00:36:00]  All the equipment in all sports are better.  You see the sticks these guys have.  In 1998, the women's Olympic team was the first year for women's in ice hockey in the Olympics.  That's adorable.  They had about four or five girls that could shoot the puck from the point hard and get it in the air.  I was out with them in Lake Placid about four years later.  They were ripping the puck.  Really?  A lot of these new sticks.  I mean, they just...  So the goalie's equipment then has to...  You know, it's a little bit of a marmissary.  These guys get better sticks.  Goalies have to get better, lighter stuff. 
[00:36:30]  And they do.  It's amazing.  Have you ever been beaten up on the ice?  I'm always amazed by these guys who fight.  They're just holding each other up and punching each other.  And I'm like, it's probably less scary that way because you know the guy's not going to kick you.  He's not going to stomp you.  But it's just embarrassing to be beaten up on fucking skates.  No, you know, I had...  I know it was in Wisconsin.  I had a teacher.  You know, is that like wrestling?  Is that kind of an act?  Is that part of it?  I'm like...  Yes, that?  No, you know, with the blood coming out and the tooth being lost, that actually hurts.  Right.  And that's another reason to play goalie, by the way. 
[00:37:00]  You don't really have to do your own fights.  Big guys will handle that.  Oh man, you lay a hand on the goalie, it's over, Johnny.  With that, though, I've got to ask you, what beef do you have with the other goalie that  there's some action happening and now you have to meet him at center ice to fight the goalie?  And you see it every once in a while.  That always is hilarious.  Because there are two turtles going at it, you know?  Because you guys weren't bumping into each other and trash talking.  And try to find a place you can punch a goalie.  I mean, you've got to get him in the head because everything else is covered, you know?  Where are you going to get him? 
[00:37:30]  I always found that funny, especially in older hockey games.  The goalies had to square up for whatever reason.  And then they've got to go down the ice and it takes about 10 minutes to get there and  they're like, dude, the period's over.  How come the goalies would square up?  Because they were the two weakest guys in the ice.  They would be bench-clearing brawls and all of a sudden you see the goalies meet at center ice.  Actually, in a serious way, one way it does happen is if it's for whatever reason, your  team has five and my team has four and now two guys are beating up one, the goalie's kind  of compelled to go in.  So you're sticking up for your buddy. 
[00:38:00]  Yeah, yeah, even it up a little bit.  And so then the other goalie says, is that goalie going in and all, you know?  I kind of miss the fighting in hockey, I'll be honest with you.  You know what?  I mean, now you've got a couple of enforcers on every team that fight pretty much and that's  about it.  Well, think about it.  If you're the commissioner of the league, you are, look, part of the game is a hugely passionate  game and, you know, guys lose it out there and it's part of the kind of the raw energy  of it.  And fights have historically been part of it where it's not like a premeditated thing  necessarily.  It's like, all right, you hit me, you hit me once, you hit me twice, I won you.  And now it's like, poof, those are off and on it goes.  And it sells the game. 
[00:38:30]  And at the same time, a lot of people are like, well, why don't you eliminate that?  So, I mean, that's, if you're the guy, it's a balance and you've got to figure it out.  But if you're at the game when a fight happens, even the little kids are like on their  chairs checking it out.  Look, man, I grew up in Philadelphia and if you weren't going to, you know, if they're beating  you, you're going to beat up on them.  You know what I was noticing also, they're playing so fast these days that if you take  a hit personally and start a beef with someone, you're really taking yourself out of the game  for that moment.  I noticed a lot of plays, even last night, a lot of hits, and I was thinking to myself, 
[00:39:00]  wow, he should really take that personally.  That was a nasty, nasty hit.  But I guess you've got to get right back into the game.  You've got to suck it up.  You can't have a thin skin.  Right, right.  And just start like every, you're offended by every hit.  But you know, the smart players in all sports, they'll mark your number and go, okay, you  know, we're getting a 1-1 game right now, but you have 5-5.  I'm going to pop them right in the face.  But how do you wait?  How do you wait?  Yeah.  When you want to punch someone in the face, you've got to punch them immediately.  Slow Sicilian revenge thing. 
[00:39:30]  How great is it, though, when you just stand there by yourself on the goal and it's all this  shit's happening on the other end of the ice?  That's got to be so relaxing.  Relax!  How nice is that?  You know, there's no one bothering you.  You know what, there was periods of the game last night where Lundqvist didn't have a  lot of action, and then it's hard, because you know you're going to get it, and it could  be 15 minutes, it could be 5 minutes, but you're going to get that shot, and it could  be a great one.  Now you're kind of cold, just watching, and all of a sudden you're a spectator instead  of a participant.  You've got to be good.  You can almost get hypnotized, right?  Yeah.  That's why mental toughness is a big part of it.  Wow.  Yeah.  I love the agreements some guys have. 
[00:40:00]  Like, there is all sorts of fights going on, and you grab a guy, and you're like, you don't  want to fight, do you?  Nah, I don't either.  They're holding each other just chatting.  Look at that guy over there.  How's the wife and kids?  But I love it.  It's so funny, because they're holding on kind of, but they...  I really don't want to get hitched.  There's an agreement there, like, we're not going to fight on this one.  You know, it's true, too.  I mean, the amazing thing is, everybody knows everybody in the league, right?  So, I mean, you may have just been traded from the Islanders, now you're in the Rangers,  and you're in the room right now.  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  So, it can be really...  One thing about the sport, you set yourself to getting stronger and faster. 
[00:40:30]  What do you think about expanding the rinks?  That's been something that has been discussed for a long time.  Yeah, and I think it's something they need to look at, just because there's just so little  ice.  And I think one of the things you always want to do, you know, when I played, one of the  most gifted guys out there is Brian Leach.  The dude could get, you know, a puck and go from one end to the other.  If you put him in a room as small as his studio, and there's eight other guys there, you're  not going to see his genius.  Right.  You just can't keep bumping into guys that are inferior to his skating ability, and that  neutralizes.  A bad guy shouldn't neutralize a good guy, whether it's basketball or hockey or whatever. 
[00:41:00]  You want to see those great players play.  And so, a bigger rink means that you have more ice.  If you're a superior skater than me, you're going to dance around me if you have the room.  So, you see that in the Olympics, and so you get a glimmer on how good it can be, and  the Olympics is pretty damn good hockey.  What is the problem with that?  What are the issues?  I'd say, number one, you're taking seats out.  You have a kid there?  Ah, boy.  But they can figure out a way to make that money out.  You know, but it's a retrofit of an arena.  So, if you have, you know, your sheet is, whatever it is, 200 long, and you want to 
[00:41:30]  expand it a little bit now, you literally have to jackhammer up.  How much would you think that they would have to expand it?  Like six inches or more?  Oh, no, about...  Six inches.  Eight to ten.  No.  It's about 15 feet.  Oh, wow, yeah.  Either side, it can be really big.  15 feet?  Yeah.  I can't remember what the international is, but it's significant.  And when you're out there as a goalie, you know, the forwards, they feel it because there's  more ice to maneuver.  The defense, I think, is the hardest on because now, guys, you can't just push them up against  the wall.  Yeah.  They have another 10 feet on either side to really get around you. 
[00:42:00]  It puts a premium on the side.  I think it'd be great to expand it, but then put the seats back on the ice, and people  would have to sit there and just take it.  And you really feel like they keep up part of the game.  You know, I have a player fly in, take out 10 seats.  They slip on their way to the fucking seat with coffee.  Beer in hand and his hot dog.  And cheeks split open.  I just feel like they're not going to have a choice in a few more years.  I do wonder, because like you're saying, you have to make these decisions so fast.  I think the biggest thing is, what's the entertainment value?  Because ultimately, this is an entertainment, all sports are. 
[00:42:30]  And you say, what's going to give us the best product?  And honestly, every time you go to the Olympics now, the hard part is, you're looking at all-star  teams.  You're looking at the best in Russia versus the best in Canada versus the best in the  United States.  Five teams, Swedes, Finns, Russians, they all feel like they can win the gold medal each  year.  And they should.  They're amazing.  So you are seeing all-star teams.  But the quality of play is so good on those big ice surfaces.  So it's something that a lot of people talk about.  But look at four and four.  You take one guy off of each team in overtime during the regular season. 
[00:43:00]  Right, right.  Love it.  All of a sudden, there's ice.  And that's the big thing.  You want to see the great players move.  How many Olympic teams were you involved in?  I was in three.  Three.  Wow.  Three.  Amazing.  I was one as an amateur in 88 before I played with the Rangers.  And then two as a pro.  So yeah, it's awesome.  It's a cool thing.  How many of you, Jimmy?  I dropped out.  No, no, no.  I pucked for a couple of years as a boy, but I hurt my ankle doing ballet.  It's a long story, Mike.  Yeah, no, it sounds ugly.  Yes, it is.  Yes.  Oh, my God. 
[00:43:30]  Well, what are you promoting?  Let's get some business taken care of.  So Brandon Steiner is not here.  Unfortunately, his wife, Mara, fell six.  Oh, no.  I was just going to curse him, too.  No, I was all morning until I actually heard there's a real excuse.  So his wife is quite ill, so I wish her well on him.  But actually, we're going.  There's the core four, as Brandon likes to call it.  Adam Graves, Brian Leach, and Mark Messy and myself are going to be at the 92nd Street Y on Friday in the evening.  And we're having a question and answer session. 
[00:44:00]  I don't know how they came up with the core four.  Apparently, Fab Four was taken.  Yes.  You'll get sued for that.  Mediocre three was taken by us.  But, no, it's awesome.  You know, these guys are my friends, and, I mean, they feel like family to me.  But I always learn something.  You have, like, a relaxed atmosphere to actually have canned questions and answers.  But then the people from the stands can ask.  So we can mingle around.  If there is a game five, which we all know there will be.  Sure.  It'll start a little bit earlier, so you can watch the game afterwards at 530. 
[00:44:30]  But it's at the 92nd Street Y.  It'll be awesome.  Well, you just casually said you went back to school.  It says Richter enrolled in Yale University and received his degree in ethics, politics, and economics.  I did enroll.  I could never accept it as the end.  Oh, okay.  I see that.  Exactly.  He applied for a job.  He didn't actually.  I just showed up.  Wow.  I wrote NASA to be an astronaut.  That doesn't mean I was one.  So, would you go back for four years?  I had two years left, and it took me four years to get him done.  Didn't really?  If that's any indication of how I was at Yale. 
[00:45:00]  No, I mean, it was awesome.  I wanted to be around the New York area.  I applied to the best schools I could get into, returning as an adult.  I mean, I'm 38 years old.  It's a little different.  But it was awesome.  It really was.  My college career was, in a way, cut short, playing in the Olympic team, then on to the pros.  And I figured that would be a way when you end.  It is hard.  And it's a way of doing something.  Because first thing people say, oh, man, you just retired.  What are you doing now?  And you're like, ah, washing my car.  I don't know.  That's what everyone thinks when they hear retired is like just mulling around the house 
[00:45:30]  trying to figure out what to do.  But it was cool.  I had young kids growing up.  I went back to school and finished off a degree.  And then you go on through life.  So it was helpful.  Where are you at with kids going right to the pros?  We think that you should.  If you have the opportunity to make millions of dollars, why would you stay in college?  Aren't we all in college to try to get a good job that pays well?  So I was in Philadelphia when Kobe Bryant was coming up.  And this kid, Kobe Bryant.  17 years old.  Yeah, and they're like, this kid's an idiot.  What is he doing?  He's giving up a college scholarship.  But I would preface this by saying there are very few of those Kobe Bryant. 
[00:46:00]  So when you're that kind of can't miss guy, I think you should.  The window to play on the pros is very narrow.  You don't say, you know, I'm going to finish this degree and then maybe take a year off  to travel Europe.  And then I'm going to come back at 29 and try to make the right.  It's not going to happen when that thing opens.  And by the way, it doesn't just open because you're really good right now.  They're looking at you and saying, hey, man, you're 18.  You're 18 and you're 165 pounds and you need to put 20 pounds on and learn how to play a  pro game.  Like, there is actually true development that goes on.  In baseball, you always saw in the AAA and all that. 
[00:46:30]  In hockey, it's become that too.  So you might leave college like I did and have a lot of growing to do.  And I need it to go to the minors.  And I mean, I was kind of disappointed.  I'm like, what?  I thought I was so good.  And I'm like, no.  I mean, you have so much to learn.  Get yourself down there.  Play a pro game.  I went from playing 42 games or 45 games in the Western Hockey League at Wisconsin,  an awesome place to develop, to playing 88 games in the minors.  It's a different mindset.  You're getting off a bus playing five and eight games in four different cities.  You start to develop how to apply your skill.  But the other side of that is you're playing in the college there and you get an injury 
[00:47:00]  that messes up your whole chance.  That's another way of looking at it, right?  That's another risk.  Yeah.  You blow out a knee or something.  The next thing you know, you're not going to go to the NBA.  If Kobe Bryant didn't make it, well, he's got a couple million dollars in the bank and  now go back to school.  How bad is that?  Yeah.  You have to be careful.  Where I think it starts to become a discussion is on the cusp where you're an okay player.  There's no slam dunk.  You'll ever make it.  You have a college scholarship and you're a freshman.  You go, screw it.  I'm going to put a square peg in a round hole.  I'm going. 
[00:47:30]  And even the team might not want you and you just end up languishing the minors.  Now you're dumped out somewhere.  You didn't make the money and you kind of sacrificed.  But they talk about it like you can never go back to college.  That's the silly part of that argument.  That is the silly part of it.  You're exactly right.  You can always go back.  I mean, at 38, you can still go back.  Right.  Did they know you when you went back, by the way?  The other students?  Did they all like, oh my God.  I think I was that old.  Who is this old guy?  I was the old guy.  That's kind of sucked when you're going back and you're just a regular guy.  You know, it was great.  I mean, you either contribute or you don't in class. 
[00:48:00]  They treat you very, very well.  So it was awesome.  That's what you want.  What fraternity did you pledge?  Oh, you ought to wear my fucking jersey and skates.  He was a Stanley Cup winning goalie that went back to school.  He didn't do his homework.  No, you know, honestly, you know, it is funny because you're in such a different place.  Like, I'm going home to change diapers, you know.  And these guys are like, hey, party now.  I'm like, oh man, I've got a whole different life ahead of me.  Yeah, yeah.  So it was great.  It was an awesome experience.  So you just walked around campus like that, right? 
[00:48:30]  You know, actually, I volunteered.  I helped out with the coaching staff with the team.  Oh, I'm sure.  There was a team there.  In fact, I mean, my brother did note as soon as I left, they became a very good team.  So I said, you know, they're just slow to get my system.  Yeah, yeah.  You loosened it up for them.  And your number's retired, right?  It is, yeah.  It's at the guard.  The Rangers don't retire a lot of numbers.  They didn't for a while.  And then they seem like a lot of them hatching up a little bit.  Yeah, mass crazy.  But for most of the time, they didn't.  No, and I think at the time, again, when you, and your job gets finished, all of a sudden,  it's like, yeah, I remember the GM, Glenn Saylor, saying, you know, we're going to retire your number. 
[00:49:00]  And at the time, like, it felt good.  But I think you're thinking about, oh, I just lost my career.  Like, it's great the number's retired, but I wouldn't be playing.  And, you know, it's not until years later you go, holy, you know, the first time I came back to the garden just to watch a game and your number's up there.  It's amazing, because that doesn't change in your life, and it's a great thing.  When your number was retired, there were only a few others.  Yeah.  How many?  Three or four or something like that?  Eddie Jockman and Roger Bear.  That was it.  You were the third.  Yeah.  Wow.  Unreal. 
[00:49:30]  That's a hell of an honor.  That's true, yeah.  I guess they grabbed a couple from that 94 team.  A couple from the 94, and you know what?  It's no coincidence.  These are, you know, special players and special guys.  Yeah, yeah.  It is.  It was a great team.  Well, you know, I'll give it to you.  There you go.  That didn't feel so bad, did it?  Say it again.  Take a deep breath.  But this team's not winning.  Oh, this team's not winning.  By the way, I'm going to say this.  Not only is this team great right now, they're young, and they're going to be great for a  couple of years.  I don't see anybody in the East getting better than them next year, so something to look for.  What about your Flyers? 
[00:50:00]  Flyers are a tough team.  They are a tough team, and they look like they have very good goaltending now.  You know, Rangers handled them really well in that first round.  I don't think a lot of people anticipated that.  Rangers kind of upped their game a little bit more.  Flyers probably have a few young guys that they have to develop, but  they're better.  They'll be better next year, but they're not going to catch the Rangers, in my opinion.  When the fans are, like, banging on the glass and stuff, is that annoying?  Not if they're banging for you.  When they're banging against you.  And are you happy there's glass, so you can't really hear what they're saying about your 
[00:50:30]  mother or something?  I can read that.  It ain't pretty.  Wow.  Yeah.  Do they ever say things that are inappropriate?  There was a couple inappropriate things thrown my way.  Things that are not related to the game?  Apparently they thought they were.  Oh, God.  You know what's funny is in the minors you really hear it, because, I mean, we were playing  like Indianapolis, and, you know, the place can hold 12,000, 15,000.  There might be 3,000 people in the seat.  So if someone wants to get on you, it's going to echo.  Oh, wow.  There was a couple of references to various parts of cows and my sister's swallowing ability 
[00:51:00]  at one point.  Oh, wow.  Especially since cows are female.  That's even hotter.  I called my sister.  I'm like, when's the last time you've been here?  I'm like, yeah.  When are you in Indianapolis?  Mike Richter.  You're all right, man.  That's good.  Can you tell the Rangers fans to leave Dennis Poffman alone?  That's enough already.  Wow.  Enough already.  For a year.  Enough already.  He's been retired for, what, 25 years now?  I think Dennis has some thick skin.  You know, actually, it's a sign of respect, though, isn't it? 
[00:51:30]  They usually don't get on the guy who's no good.  And Dennis was an amazing player.  And, yeah, I think it's really cool.  The Rangers fans have that long memory, and they have a great history.  Do the players feel it when you guys play the Islanders?  The Rangers-Islanders games are just so much fun.  They are so much fun.  Just fights in the stands, the chants.  And I think people who don't experience it are like, all right, well, you know, that's  the hype on TV and radio, right?  Right.  It's not.  Guys come and trade as a team, like, you know, I heard about this, and I didn't really  get it.  Oh, my God.  You know, some mean-nothing game in the middle of February. 
[00:52:00]  One team might be out of the playoffs, and, you know, the other one might be.  You pointed at me, being an Irish fan.  But over the years, it could be either of us.  But that game means everything.  It does, right?  It's bragging rights, and, you know, obviously, there's a huge kind of rivalry.  New York is a rivalry with everybody.  I mean, within, you know, how many miles away are you?  Oh, yeah, that Long Island Railroad would be just a light with people yelling at each  other.  But don't forget, you know, you go to Long Island, there's plenty of Ranger fans there,  and there's plenty of Islander fans there.  So it is just like...  What do you mean plenty?  Sometimes there's more Rangers fans at Nassau Coliseum. 
[00:52:30]  No, the Ranger fans do kind of invade.  Yeah, that's a little frustrating.  Well, I mean, if they go to the Barclays Center, that may change, right?  I don't know if it's going to have the same vibe.  I don't know if it will, either.  Right?  You know, it's a different feel.  But it might be a new start, too, you know?  Well, we need to do something.  That Coliseum is just a disaster.  No, it's an older place, and it's a tough place to play.  But I tell you, that's a pretty damn good young team they have.  This guy needs to talk to Chris in Hoboken.  We've got Mike Richter in studio.  Chris, go ahead.  Hey, Richter. 
[00:53:00]  Two things.  You were talking about the fans.  Do you remember seeing the one side?  I think it was someone played in Boston.  Tyler Seguin, or however you say his name.  And the two chicks had this sign up on the glass that said,  We sucked your dick in high school.  Jesus.  You know, I don't think they get a lot of air time on NBC.  Yeah, yeah, I bet.  I didn't see it.  Unless you're live, you probably missed that one.  But no, it's...  Oh, wow.  That might have been across the line a little.  How great is that?  You can Google that.  It came up.  The reason I called you is I just wanted to say,  I've been at a lot of sporting events. 
[00:53:30]  The greatest sporting event I was ever at in my entire life,  and I was at the Motto game.  My dad and I sat at Game 7 against Vancouver,  and it was the greatest father-son moment.  So I just wanted to personally thank you,  and I appreciate you guys giving me the chance to do it with Mike Richter.  That's very cool.  Thanks, man.  Well, you know, I mean, honestly, it goes both ways.  You know, Mess is always kind of...  I thought it was cool when he got to stay in the cup.  He went right over to the fans, you know,  and let them touch it and all,  because I think that's when it kind of clicks in a lot of players' minds.  Holy smokes, I'm representing the city here, you know?  So it goes both ways.  The players, you know, thank the fans. 
[00:54:00]  It's amazing.  There's another call.  Paul from the Bronx.  Paul.  Yeah, hey, guys.  Hey.  Mike, I just wanted to ask you,  I know sometimes it seems like the fans are more enthusiastic about the game  and the players,  and when you have a rivalry like the Rangers and Islanders,  they play differently,  and when you're in the playoffs, they play differently.  It seems like they should be playing every game that hard and that, you know, serious.  Can I answer that question, Mike?  Yes, in the back row.  Yeah, go ahead.  I think they have to pace themselves. 
[00:54:30]  It's a brutal sport.  They do have to pace themselves to a degree.  I mean, honestly, though, it used to be in hockey, it's, oh, man, 16 teams make the playoffs.  You know, you're going to be a short end.  Not now.  Great teams don't make it, and the Islanders were not a bad team,  and they didn't make it this year.  So you have to fight down.  And look, the Rangers were a couple points out, too, right?  And they're in the finals.  So I think you have to kind of claw and scratch your way there.  I just think you're right, though.  82 games, there's fatigue that sets in.  There's guys that are injured that are still in the lineup, 
[00:55:00]  but you don't see that necessarily in the stats,  but they're kind of working through an injury.  But I think kind of everything stops when you do play those rivalries,  and that's a good thing because the year is pretty damn intense,  even the regular season, but it's punctuated by those special games,  and those things are always tough.  Imagine if some of these sports cut down their games.  We were talking about baseball, 162 games in the year 2014.  It doesn't make sense anymore.  You bring up a really good point, though.  Look, if I'm the commissioner, I want there to be 200 games  because you're selling a product, right?  Of course, of course.  But at the same time, you know, the Players Association with Football were saying, 
[00:55:30]  you know, these guys are having a hard time walking by the end of the year.  You know, let's cut down the number of games.  The intensity would go way up.  Cut it down to five games, charge a million a ticket.  Absolutely.  Those people say, Jim, you're an asshole, but I don't think so.  That's for other reasons.  You might be right.  But those shortened seasons, coming back from a strike or whatever,  every game is a completely different feel.  Yeah, and it's a little bit of a game of attrition.  Like you look at even the Stanley Cup playoffs.  I mean, coming into this, the Rangers have played 20 games, 
[00:56:00]  and L.A. have played 21 in every one of those games.  There's a lot of order time.  And they were all intense.  They're exhausted mentally, physically, and they just keep going and going and going.  So, you know, by the end of this, if this one goes seven games,  that could be 28 games.  That's more than a third of a season.  That's a lot of hockey to play.  And Mass said that.  You know, a couple years, they were in the finals, maybe four to five years.  It started to take a toll.  That's almost like another year or two.  Season.  Yeah, yeah.  And it's the intense kind.  At least a season.  Do you develop a dislike for sports writers?  I mean, I'm wondering, because sometimes they're legit in their criticism. 
[00:56:30]  And other times, you know, honestly, and I think some of you look at the older guys,  they know the sports writers have a job to do.  And sometimes they're going to be saying, you stunk today.  And deep down, you know you did.  I don't think there's too many times people say you stink when you just didn't.  But it's never good to hear or read.  And they have a job to do.  And so it's not always going to be pretty.  And their job is, they're not paid to make you happy.  Are you happy there wasn't a Twitter and Facebook back?  It's actually, it is different, man. 
[00:57:00]  You know, it's an easy way to get into trouble.  But also, these guys also have a way of communicating with their fans in a pretty cool way.  So you've got to be careful, obviously.  But I think everybody jumps on that and just says, you know, how can we, again,  we're selling a product, whether you're a team, a league, or an individual player,  you're pushing a product.  But now everyone has a voice instead of just the sports writers.  Now just some guy can say there and go, you sucked last night.  And you've got to read that and be like, oh, man.  And it's hard not to take that because you read 10 columns or 10 blurbs about yourself 
[00:57:30]  and, you know, two guys saying you're the worst player that's ever, you know,  walked to the face of the earth, you know.  I don't know if 10% of the people out there think it, but 10% of the people just read did.  So you've got a little bit of a skewed perspective.  You know, I know Terry Bradshaw and older players like that,  they used to say they never would read the press.  Right.  They're either giving you too much credit or too little.  You know, if you're a good player, you know what you should be doing  and you should have a higher standard.  Now you can't really stay away from it, though.  No, it's everywhere.  It's right in your face.  How can you not read it, though? 
[00:58:00]  They probably just didn't want to give the sports writers the satisfaction of knowing  that they were reading it.  What is your name?  I've never...  No, you know what?  You have a relationship with the guys, and they have a job to do, and you understand that.  And for the most part, honestly, there's a lot of respect going both ways.  Right.  We're being told you've got to catch a train.  Oh, man.  You have to catch a train.  I'm going to go to the Y right now and just wait because it's such a good event.  No, it's going to be a great thing.  And we actually have a good friend that's part of the Ranger organization that we're doing  a signing up in Westchester on Saturday. 
[00:58:30]  Matty Locken, a good friend of ours, has cancer, and we're doing a little bit of a fundraiser  for him.  But the Y on Friday night is going to be a blast.  So come on out.  The Core 4.  Yeah, Core 4.  And call Steiner Sports.  Do we have a number here?  We should have a number.  Steiner Sports.  I don't have a number.  SteinerSports.com for tickets.  Go on there.  It's going to be a cool thing.  And it's a celebration of the Rangers' 94 Stanley Cup Championship.  Oh, he's involved with the whole 90-second field, I think.  Yeah, he's awesome.  He does so much charity work.  Yeah.  Hey, I've got to ask you one more thing, though.  Sure.  When the other team pulls their goalie, how much are you thinking, I'd like to score? 
[00:59:00]  You know, you get the puck and your stick and you say, I don't know I want to score,  but I really wish I had a better wrist shot because right now all I'm doing is setting  them up if I try for this thing.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's why so few have done it.  It's actually not as easy as it looks.  Have you ever?  A goalie with all that stuff.  I've gone for it, but no.  But you are thinking like, I could do that.  When you have a two-goal lead, you can give one up.  There's 60 seconds left to go in a game.  It's like, green light.  But without the two-goal lead, you're going to the side.  When it's a one-goal lead, it's like, stick in there. 
[00:59:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Stay in the net, hero.  Get it over there.  That's great.  What about those open net goals, though?  For your stats.  For my stats.  Oh, man.  You're like, fuck.  Guys, thanks for having me on, man.  I appreciate it.  Great time, man.  I didn't want to like you.  I know that.  I know that.  But I like Mike Richter, I've got to say.  I brought your coffee.  I want to adhere myself to you, but I end up drinking it.  Thanks, Mike.  Come back and see us.  Yeah, thanks, Tim, for having me, guys.  All right.  All right, great.  I'm Sirius XM.

The Squatty Potty is so simple because it helps you elevate your knees while enjoying the comfort of your own toilet.  Plus, the Squatty Potty is for everyone, not only those with problems.

[01:09:00]  I asked him how old he was when he started pucking.  Oh, he started pucking.  That's the way you talk to a hockey player.  That was so douchey.  I'm glad he didn't acknowledge it and just fucking plowed through and gave you an answer like you asked a mature adult question.  He was good.  He was great.  Definitely.  I didn't want to like him.  He's a good guy, man.  It was fun.  Pretty cool.  Mike Richter.  Wow.  Oh, that's a...  There's the sign.  Tyler.  That's a fake sign. 
[01:09:30]  Is it?  I believe so.  Yeah, I heard the Photoshop.  I've heard...  I don't know.  Tyler, number 19.  I think they might have proven it was fake or something.  I wasn't sure.  He's laughing, but...  And the girls are waving and smiling, but...  I don't know.  I don't know.  Urban legend.  Yeah.  Perhaps.  Hello.  Hello?  Yeah, what's up?  Yeah, I was just wondering if Howard Stern has given up when he stopped doing radio shows,  what happens to you when you give up? 
[01:10:00]  What?  We're not sure what you mean, sir.  Please clarify.  What are you talking about?  What do you mean?  You're not working Fridays anymore, are you?  And why does that bother you?  What does that have to do with your life and what you're doing?  Because...  Huh?  Huh?  Your phone is really crapping out.  We're not...  I'm not doing a bit.  You actually...  Your phone is honestly crapping out.  Yeah, why would that bother you?  Bothered me. 
[01:10:30]  I'm going to open your mouth and be funny.  I can't hear him.  You're funny.  Hold on.  Now you can say it again.  Your phone's back.  Go ahead.  You're going to be funny for me.  Hello?  Yes.  So what are you saying when we take off on Fridays...  Right.  Why does that bother you and what...  It bothers me because I'm the listener and you're going to open that mouth.  It's going to be funny for me.  I understand what you're saying. 
[01:11:00]  He wants us to be entertaining for him and...  Oh, we're supposed to be funny for him.  Well, hopefully we're funny for you four days a week.  That's pretty cool.  Yeah.  That is cool.  But I'd like it to be fine.  I think there's a lot of discussion about the Fridays thing.  And the fact is that we saved up all our vacation time so we could do Fridays off in the summer.  And then we'll see what happens after that.  Oh, okay.  That makes sense then.  I thought you just...  No, but that is the truth.  I mean, haters are going to hate. 
[01:11:30]  And we gave them a nice one to really go for.  But the fact is, anyone that listens to the show on a regular basis knows we barely took any time off.  We took a little time around Christmas and here and there.  We missed a day, sure.  But it turns out that we didn't even come close to using up all our vacation time.  As far as our two-week-long vacations with cruises and things like that, it just didn't pan out this year.  So, right now...  Enjoy your vacation.  I'm sorry.  I love it. 
[01:12:00]  All right.  Wow, it's that easy to turn some of these guys around?  Yeah, it's all it takes.  Okay.  It's a little explanation.  In the end, we're not taking any extra days as far as to the end of the contract.  And we'll see what happens after that.  Frankie says relax.  Kenny told me on a Wednesday afternoon.  Really?  None of you guys told me.  Kenny just goes, we're off Fridays from now on.  I'm like, oh, thank you.  Oh, goody.  I don't know.  Goody, goody.  I thought everyone knew.  Nobody tells me.  I actually used it as an excuse to have a few beers last night. 
[01:12:30]  I saw that.  Because I'm like, well, it's Monday, right?  Right.  But we're off Friday, so it's like a Tuesday.  Right.  But then the show is done for the Monday.  So you can really push it to another day.  So it was like Wednesday.  Nice.  And who doesn't have a beer on the hump day?  What day is it now?  This is like Thursday now, right?  No, it still feels like a Tuesday.  I don't know.  But what day does it feel like?  Are we kind of like a Wednesday right now?  It feels like a Wednesday, a little.  It feels like a Wednesday, almost a Thursday. 
[01:13:00]  I'm feeling it.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Well, but.  So that's that then.  Done.  Yeah.  Oh, trust me.  They wouldn't allow us to take extra days.  Jesus.  That's why I laughed at all that when all that shit hit the fan.  I'm like, do these guys understand this company would never allow us to just take extra days?  Yeah.  We figured out a while ago, okay, if we suck it up and, you know, save our days, then maybe  we can enjoy, you know, the summer a little bit.  Nice three-day weekends.  There's no extra days involved here. 
[01:13:30]  My.  You think this company's going to go, oh, you guys want Fridays off now?  Fine, no problem.  And we'll redo the studio.  Right.  Just more uninformed people that think they know what the fuck's going on.  I know.  No.  They would not just give us extra days off.  I talked to somebody that works there and knows.  Yeah.  Did you?  How's Tracy Morgan doing?  It looks like he's going to make a recovery, which is fucking great news.  Pretty beat up, I guess.  Yeah.  But they said leg, ribs, nose. 
[01:14:00]  Yeah.  Ribs and a femur.  There is a weird rumor that they're not going to take his leg after all or something.  I heard of something about an amputation.  That's the rumor that was going around.  And I think we're going to take his leg.  I heard of that.  That's bullshit.  Was that bullshit, that one?  Yeah, that's bullshit.  And then, well, first of all, Artie Fuqua, how's he doing?  No news on him.  Jimmy, you know anything on Artie?  Amazing.  Do not know.  Because all the news has been about Tracy. 
[01:14:30]  Yeah.  So it's like, you know, I don't know anybody.  I've met his family, but I don't know them well.  And I don't know anybody that's actually gone to the hospital.  Because I don't think you'd be able.  Because Tracy is a celebrity, I think that they would probably have it on kind of like  lockdown.  Yeah.  Because I would love to go see Artie.  I've texted him and I have not heard back.  Which, again, that's not untypical for Artie.  Right.  Literally, I was carrying out a conversation with him probably a week ago on text.  Three days later, he got back to me and wrote like, ha, ha, ha, ha, like it's something  I had said.  He's just busy. 
[01:15:00]  Yeah.  It just seems like a lot of people have been to the hospital at this point.  So it's kind of strange that no info has come out about Artie.  Yeah.  I mean, hopefully he is okay.  I'm very concerned about him.  We love him.  Artie's, man, he's funny and he's just a great, great guy.  TMZ.  I have a little problem with TMZ.  Yeah.  They had a video up, I don't know if it's still there, of one of the guys being taken  out of the limbo bus.  Yep.  And the problem I have is really simple. 
[01:15:30]  They, you know, they have a problem with language and this and that and they put their  asterisks and stuff, but they have no problem showing this.  Isn't this way worse than not spelling out the N-word?  Yeah.  Voyeuristic, gruesomeness, like...  This is way worse than language.  It's pandering.  Yeah, absolutely worse than language.  That shit drives me nuts.  It's like, whoa, whoa, you know.  Yeah.  We can't spell out, you know, the N-word, but we have no problem showing this.  This is horrific. 
[01:16:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Video shot just after Crash.  Panic in the streets.  Oh, wow.  The crash scene.  Hmm.  It's just that there's no rhyme or reason to it, I guess, is what I'm trying to say.  Yep.  But, you know, we don't have to play the video.  They know where it is if they want to suit themselves, but fuck it.  Yeah, it was really gruesome and just unnecessary.  I don't know.  I don't think that's...  I'm not even saying it's unnecessary, but, you know, if you're going to show this, is 
[01:16:30]  what I'm saying, that, in my stupid world, that's way more offensive than if my...  Than putting the word faggot up there or something.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  And having to put asterisks in and shit.  Yes.  Yeah.  Then you should just do it all.  Yeah.  You know, they're basically saying, language, this is bad if someone sees the actual word  printed out on our website.  Yeah, that's shocking.  That's offensive.  That is upsetting to people.  Meanwhile, you're watching somebody get carried out of a vehicle. 
[01:17:00]  Right.  It's really gruesome.  Oh, that's...  Wow, what a disaster.  I can't see it.  Man, when machines fucking hit each other.  That was a guy just driving by.  He filmed it.  There's another one, though.  Yeah.  Where you actually see them carrying out Tracy or something.  They say it's Tracy.  Yeah.  Can't really tell.  I can't tell.  I don't know.  It's just very voyeuristic.  Yeah, just kind of gross.  I mean...  Yeah.  I don't think it's...  I don't know.  It's not news.  It's... 
[01:17:30]  This guy works at the hospital where Tracy's at.  Go ahead, Anthony.  Oh.  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey, man.  Hey.  Yeah, it was funny, because they sent out an email.  They actually fired a nurse.  It's kind of sickening.  They...  I guess she posted it to Facebook.  So...  They sent out some privacy reminder email.  I've been there three years.  And Robert Johnson cares about patients' privacy.  Just remember that it's illegal to post things on social media, network, websites, blah, blah, blah.  They're not allowed to talk to the press. 
[01:18:00]  It's grounds for legal action.  And blah, blah, blah.  So I guess they fired one of the nurses over it already.  What had she done?  She had posted...  I guess she took a picture of Tracy.  She posted it to Facebook and said, oh, I'm taking care of him or whatever.  Oh, boy.  Cunt.  Bye-bye.  That's bad.  Don't you think, Anthony?  That's gross.  Yes, I do.  I'll write with that gag.  It's bad unless I was, you know, at the hospital.  Right.  If you had your camera, you'd have to take a picture.  It's completely outrageous that someone would do that. 
[01:18:30]  I don't know.  I can see where she was let go for that.  I think that's a chance you're taken in this new world.  No?  Yeah.  I don't know.  All right.  You can't photograph a patient and put them on...  I know.  People would say...  There are privacy issues at the hospital.  Yeah.  Your medical stuff.  Right.  People are ridiculous with their goddamn cameras.  We got apologies today?  I hope so.  Are we a day in with no apologies?  I don't think anyone...  That's my...  I don't think anyone...  Not to my knowledge.  Woodsy Niles.  You know Woodsy Niles, sir?  Not to my knowledge. 
[01:19:00]  Oh, the other thing on Tracy.  The driver didn't sleep for 24 hours before the crash.  Yeah.  What was that about?  Isn't that great?  Just working too hard?  Tons of machinery hurtling down the highway with no one at the controls, literally, because  he's asleep.  Holy shit, that's frightening.  And he was avoiding another accident, I guess?  Oh, he was?  Was he?  That was...  Yeah.  Supposedly.  And then what did it say on his Facebook?  Was it his Facebook that said, move out of the way or get hit?  Yeah.  His profile. 
[01:19:30]  His Twitter account.  Twitter account.  But he changed that.  Man, you know, obviously we all hope everybody gets better, but what a lawsuit.  Oh my goodness.  Yeah.  Walmart?  Walmart's had a rough couple of days.  I mean, this and then that shooting in the fucking parking lot, right?  Yeah.  It's such a big store.  I mean, there's a lot of people that go there.  Things are bound to happen, but that's a rough couple of days for that company.  Damn.  Yeah. 
[01:20:00]  Crazy motherfuckers.  This VA thing is driving me nuts.  More than 57,000 veterans waiting for health care more than three months.  Yeah.  Who's...  More than 57,000 veterans have been waiting for up to three months for medical appointments,  the VA department said in a wide-ranging audit released Monday.  An additional 64,000 who enrolled for VA health care over the past decade have never been seen by a doctor,  according to the audit.  Well, thank God the illegal Mexicans that are streaming over the border are getting the health care they need. 
[01:20:30]  Yeah.  And Bradley Manning, thank God, was giving a sex change or giving the harm or whatever it is.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Sex change for a traitorous fucking tranny.  I've had it.  I've had it.  Why are they waiting so long?  Does anyone know a little more about this shit?  Because it's this fake patriotism we have.  Right.  It's fake patriotism.  Where we say, hey, let's love the troops.  Let's be good to the troops.  Because it sounds good and you can never speak against the troops.  But when it comes time to, like, whether it's giving the money to the fucking first responders at the towers or doing this, 
[01:21:00]  they're just scumbags.  In this day and age, there's nothing real about anything.  There's no substance in it.  As long as you can blurt out, USA, yeah, support the troops.  It doesn't matter if you really do.  You said it and that's all that it takes.  It's like the apologies.  They don't mean anything either.  There's no substance to them.  There's no substance to anyone saying anything.  So when they say, respect the troops, love the troops, support the troops, and then they're dying before they can even get medical attention at the VA hospitals, it's a fucking travesty. 
[01:21:30]  Yeah, how about you don't talk about the troops, you just take care of them when they come back.  Right, there you go.  I'm sure they'd be much happier than to hear your fucking, your nonsense.  Enough of your yellow ribbons and your flags and all that.  Your dumb parades.  Just really take care of them.  Actually take care of them.  Yeah, give them, like, when they want to go to the doctor, how about you let them go to the doctor within a week and not wait three fucking months.  And not wait three months with a diagnosed aneurysm so he can die before he gets any treatment.  It's ridiculous. 
[01:22:00]  It's more of the phony bullshit that is just ruining this country.  Our whole culture.  It's all what you say, not what you do.  It sounds like an old man thing to say.  But it is.  It's what's being said instead of what's being done.  Got to take care of our veterans.  Jesus.  Yeah.  That seems like a no-brainer.  Well, we tribute them verbally and then things like that on the news.  Chris Daugherty is a terrible person because he walked off.  Right.  How could he walk off?  How about you, why don't you bring people who are holding up the health care on the Fox Morning Show and go, hey, scumbag, why are these people not getting what they're supposed to get? 
[01:22:30]  Lambast them.  Chris has more on this in New York.  Chris.  Yes, Opie, what's going on?  Hey.  I got a stat for you.  I heard it on Sean Hannity yesterday about the VA hospital.  There's one doctor for every 35 vets right now.  But in Guantanamo, there's 1.1 doctor for each terrorist we got in Guantanamo Bay.  Can you imagine that?  How many terrorists we got over there?  Quite a bit.  But how many?  Quite a bit. 
[01:23:00]  Because, I mean, I don't believe that stat.  That sounds completely insane because how many prisoners?  Unless there's 10 people there.  That's what I'm saying.  If there's over 100, you're trying to tell me there's close to 100 doctors there?  There's no way.  Well, that's what you were saying.  I'm just telling you what I heard.  Yeah, I understand.  We're trying to figure out...  Just regurgitating what you heard on faux news.  I think it's horrible what's going on with the vets, but that stat seems completely insane. 
[01:23:30]  Well, even if it's half-true, can you just imagine that they're more worried about these  fucking terrorists?  They are our own guys.  The terrorists, and again, the illegals that are piling, piling over the border right now.  There's all kinds of aid that the Democrats and Obama, of course, want to give to all  these children, these refugee children that are crossing the border on a daily basis.  And then they're taking these illegals, dumping them in the southern border states, like Arizona, and just dumping them at bus stations. 
[01:24:00]  Eh, wherever you want to go.  They're in the truck stops.  They're putting them at these...  At truck stops, at bus stops.  They're not arresting them.  They're not deporting anyone anymore.  The deporting rate, it plummeted because...  Under Obama.  It's embarrassing because...  And even Bush didn't fuck with the illegals.  He didn't because they have such a strong voting base.  The Latin voting base is very strong.  Nobody really wants to turn them against them. 
[01:24:30]  Can you imagine if my five-year-old was moving on a rental park by himself?  I'd have to be fixed in the house locking me up for all of them.  Yeah, exactly.  But, you know, that's okay.  And then we got a Marine in Mexico who's in jail down there.  And what does he get?  Oh, I know.  How come they don't return him?  We take care of all these Mexicans that come over the border with medical attention, schooling, food, shelter, and...  You know, they make a mean taco, so we got to take care of them. 
[01:25:00]  What can we do?  Well, now that's a little worse.  I don't know about that Marine, though.  I still don't know.  I've heard the story about how he legitimately made a wrong turn, and he called 911 from right over there and goes,  Oh, I made a wrong turn.  You know what?  I'm willing to give him the benefit of the doubt based on the evidence.  No one's really denying the fact that he did say that he had guns in the trunk.  Right.  They were legally owned by him, and he inadvertently ventured into Mexico. 
[01:25:30]  Don't you have to go through customs, though, to do that?  I don't think everywhere.  Not everywhere.  There's border crossings where you can just drive in?  Yeah, as a matter of fact, there's certain places that you're not supposed to cross that you can.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  It's like a bridge.  Right.  Regardless, yeah, there's definitely some unanswered questions, but, you know, what the fuck?  Give the guy back.  At least try to get him back. 
[01:26:00]  What the hell's stupid Kerry doing?  He really has a boob, John Kerry.  He's another one.  Between Hillary and Kerry, what big accomplishments have our Secretary of State done?  There's nothing.  Do they ever do?  I mean, I'm not saying there's no answer for it.  I just don't know what they normally do.  That seems like a useless job.  What do they normally do?  What did Albright do?  When you have a president with a very strong foreign policy and very strong in foreign affairs, you have a Secretary of State that does things.  You look at someone like Kissinger back in the Nixon days, and who was Madeleine Albright? 
[01:26:30]  Yeah.  They did stuff.  What did she do?  I don't even mean...  That was a lot with the Soviet Union, and it was a lot of talk with NATO and the Warsaw Pact countries about missile placements.  I understand it was a different time, but you've got to adjust and do something.  Right.  These motherfuckers are doing nothing, and that's why, you know, again, that's why Putin's blitzkrieging his way across the Baltics. 
[01:27:00]  Which is fine with me.  And any of the foreign...  I don't care what he does.  Former Soviet states.  Not my business.  I don't care either.  I don't care.  But people are questioning why he's so brash and doing it.  It's not...  The barn door's been open, and he's running amok because of the weak United States and weak president.  You've got people pissed off, man.  Of course.  Chris in California, go ahead.  Chris.  Oh.  Phones are shot.  You're saying the illegals don't get all those benefits. 
[01:27:30]  Yeah, they do.  Yes, they do.  They get emergency room care.  Believe me, if there's a mother and a child that crossed the border, and the child got injured, and she took him to the hospital, he's getting medical attention.  Well, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, and meanwhile, a veteran's got to wait.  That's just human decency.  Hey, I don't mind a kid getting out of mind.  That's just human decency, sir.  I don't mind a kid getting medical attention after we...  Children of the future. 
[01:28:00]  ...after what we do here is taken care of with veterans and other people that are living here legally.  Well, there's no human decency on that side of the issue.  No.  Obviously.  We're being invaded.  No one realizes it's an invasion.  You know...  Fuck.  We're, you know, we're on the other side of today's show.  We're getting closer to the end here, and you still haven't done the big I told you so that's in the paper today.  I told you so!  Do you know which one I'm talking about? 
[01:28:30]  No.  I think I do.  Not at all.  Jimmy?  Anthony, for...  Like, everyone was saying that I would not return to San Francisco, but Anthony said I would,  and that my Cobbs tickets would go on sale today for August 7th through 9th.  Nobody believes him!  I know.  I kept saying it and saying it.  Is it the Donald Sterling thing?  No.  Who is now not selling the team?  Which is a great story, too.  I'll tell you why it's a great story, because I don't know how the deal was going down.  It seems like the wife was more involved than him, but he was sort of agreeing. 
[01:29:00]  This is kind of what I've picked up.  But I think Sterling got really pissed off because he finally realized that even if he sells the team,  the NBA is not going to lift the lifetime ban, and that pissed him the fuck off.  And I think he wants his fucking money back from the fine out of principle.  So when he realized that shit wasn't going down, he's like, you know what?  Fuck you.  And then he told his lawyers, let's go forward with this lawsuit against the NBA for, I think, a billion dollars. 
[01:29:30]  And he got the...  In a way, I kind of like this.  I love it.  Because he got the...  The problem was that bitch illegally, according to him, recorded him illegally.  If he didn't know that was an illegal place, you can't use that in court.  Right.  It has to be said, because people don't...  They only listen with half an ear.  I think Donald Sterling is a shitty guy.  I have a pretty good feeling he's a shitty guy.  But he got railroaded in his house.  Yeah. 
[01:30:00]  I don't care if he's a shitty guy.  With private conversations.  Yes.  Exactly.  And that is very bothersome here.  Yep.  And now he's basically moving forward.  I think if the NBA said, all right, if you sell the team, we'll lift a lifetime ban.  Maybe that makes it a little easier.  It saves a little face.  Right.  But when he found out they're not doing that, he's like, all right, well, fuck you then.  Let's do this.  And the way they treat the players, like all...  How many of these guys...  Not all of them, of course, but a lot of them have criminal records and have committed  violent...  It's like...  It's just such fucking nonsense over shit he said to his girlfriend. 
[01:30:30]  Ugh.  Right.  And everyone knew he was a shitty guy that did shitty things, but the commissioner and  the NBA in general kind of looked the other way until it got, you know, into the mainstream  here.  But everyone in the know and in basketball knew that this guy might not be, you know, the  greatest.  So I kind of like that he's suing.  I think that was it, right?  Oh, but the...  I told you so.  And then the prosecutor's lawsuit, on page statement.  And, okay, his statement on Monday was, the team is not for sale. 
[01:31:00]  From the onset, I did not want to sell the L.A. Clippers.  So I've decided that I must fight to protect my rights, Donald Sterling said.  While my position may not be popular, I believe that my rights to privacy and the preservation  of my rights to due process should not be trampled.  I love the team and have dedicated 33 years of my life to the organization.  I intend to fight to keep the team, which means this team is going to be a complete  disaster. 
[01:31:30]  They're not going to get players coming to this team.  And that's the free market deciding.  Of course.  And then the players...  I don't blame...  Honestly, I don't blame players that wouldn't want to play for them.  Right.  I really don't.  Like, fuck this guy.  I don't want...  I can go to this team or his team.  Fuck him.  Right.  But I think the players do go if he offers them enough money.  They'll be the guys that kind of don't have as many choices as others.  Right.  I would assume. 
[01:32:00]  There was never a discussion involving the NBA in which we would modify Mr. Sterling's  penalty in any way whatsoever.  Any suggestion otherwise is complete fabrication, NBA spokesman Mike Bassett.  So that means, you know, they wanted to keep the lifetime ban and all that.  Yeah.  Well, there you go.  So...  Now you've got to find him in court.  Oh, boy.  That's going to be very, very interesting.  Have you told you so yet?  I don't.  I'm trying to figure it out.  Nope.  I know what it is.  Well, the numbers in New York City are not good.  And you said this would happen with de Blasio. 
[01:32:30]  Oh, yes.  Right.  Okay.  Shootings spike in New York City over the last year.  Not only the last year, the last couple of months, which is, you know, de Blasio's time.  The number of shooting victims has skyrocketed across the city this year, up 43% in just  the last month.  Yeah.  Oh, because the stop and frisk doesn't happen anymore.  Exactly.  While fewer guns are coming off the streets, NYPD statistics reveal, Police Commissioner  Bill Bratton has repeatedly shifted the focus from shootings to a steep decline in homicides 
[01:33:00]  and claims he is not worried about the gun violence.  But sources told the Post it will only get worse in the hotter summer months and that  the alarming trend is the result of a more reactive police force handicapped by the inability  to use tactics like stop and frisk.  Yeah.  So all the people are like, just use good police work.  Okay.  What does that mean?  Mopping up the bodies?  That's pretty much it.  Nobody in the neighborhoods will talk.  Nobody's going to say a crime is about to be committed.  And you can't stop and frisk.  So I guess basically these neighborhoods, you just got to take it. 
[01:33:30]  The numbers don't lie, man.  Just take it.  You ask for it.  This is what you wanted.  You wanted it.  And now you got it.  In the last month alone, so I guess that would be May, 129 people were shot, according  to the latest comp stat figures, or 43.3% more than from the same period last year.  Since January, there has been an overall 13.2% increase in shooting victims, with 10.2% fewer  guns have been recovered compared to 2013. 
[01:34:00]  Yeah.  Fucking asshole to Blasio.  You just listen to all the stats and everything.  And people go, well, Anthony, stop and frisk.  It's against the Constitution.  It wasn't just a random, you know, wheel someone over and frisk them.  There had to be some type of suspicion.  You know?  And I'm sure...  Yeah, believe me.  I'm not a dummy.  I know the cops will look and go, well, I saw something.  But, again, you know, it's in the bad neighborhoods. 
[01:34:30]  You're the people that are affected.  People in the bad neighborhoods.  And they don't want to talk to the police.  They don't want to fucking...  So, you know, you made your bed lie in it.  It's like, what do you want?  Yeah.  What do you want?  I was just in the church about one time.  I was like, what are you supposed to do to stop it?  Good police work.  Fair enough.  What is good police work?  Yeah.  Like, I know you can't just stop people because of how they look.  That is a really shitty way to be.  But if you're in a certain neighborhood and the cops kind of know who's... 
[01:35:00]  If you're looking for fucking mobsters, you don't stop, you know, little old Jewish women.  Right.  Right.  Well, the fact of the matter is, over 80% of the gun crime is committed by minorities in New York City.  Well over 80%.  I think it was closer to 93%.  And that's who you want to look for as far as weapons go.  That's who you're looking for.  So when they say, why are the minorities the ones that are getting stopped and frisked on suspicion of having a weapon? 
[01:35:30]  Well, because that's who has the weapons.  Yeah, but if you said that, you came out and said that, even Bloomberg would have had you fired.  And he was the one pushing stop and frisk.  Of course.  You can't...  What was it?  Christine Todd Whitman's...  The guy who ran...  The head trooper?  Yeah.  Said that, well, there's a lot more black people getting arrested.  He goes, because they're committing more crimes.  Yeah.  And he was fired.  He was fired.  Well, Bloomberg said at one point, we're not even stopping and frisking, we should be stopping and frisking more black people, he said. 
[01:36:00]  Oh, that's right.  Because as far as the percentage of the crime went to the percentage of people that were being stopped and frisked, it still didn't balance out.  But you can't say that, apparently, I guess.  You can't do that.  You can't do...  Nope.  So now, you know, deal with it.  And if it stays up in the shitty neighborhoods, I could give a flying fuck.  Go ahead.  Kill yourselves.  It's when it starts oozing down into the good parts of town and the crime and shootings start encroaching on civilized humans that are trying to live a life and fucking conduct business. 
[01:36:30]  That's when things will happen again.  I feel bad for most people in those neighborhoods, though, because they're the ones...  A lot of people in those neighborhoods were for it, because they don't want to have to deal with it.  They don't want to...  They're the ones getting shot at.  They're the ones whose, you know, family members are getting robbed.  Then fucking do something.  Group up.  Do something more than prayers and anti-gun fucking things.  It's the degenerates in the neighborhood that are fucking you.  Not white man, not fucking guns, not... 
[01:37:00]  It's the degenerate fucking animals that are killing your kids, your grandmas, everyone else that gets hit.  Because of poor aim.  And, uh...  That's the deal.  If you want it fixed, let the police do their work.  Or fucking do something yourselves.  Unite.  Unite for good.  Not to defend fucking, you know, some drug dealer that got shot by a cop.  Fucking A.  Unite for good. 
[01:37:30]  Sweep your fucking porch.  Sweep your patios.  Clean the streets.  Fucking speak English in your home so your kid can fill out a job.  Job application when he gets older.  For the love of Christ on a pony.  Um...  Hello?  Oh.  My.  God.  Hey, guys.  Guys.  On a serious note.  On a serious note!  What was I doing? 
[01:38:00]  Fucking...  What was I...  Hey, everybody!  Woo-hoo!  The neighborhood's a pretty bad...  Don't you know?  Woo-hoo!  We gotta...  Stop the violence!  Woo-hoo!  Woo-hoo!  Woo-hoo!  Woo-hoo!  Don't you know?  Kids are getting killed!  And she just babbles over a bitch.  An idiot!  An idiot!  An idiot!  Well, no, no, no, no.  You shut your yap!  You can't yell at her for being bad at radio. 
[01:38:30]  She didn't fucking pick the phone up.  You can't...  This is not bad at radio.  Trust me.  She's not good at radio.  She's great at radio.  Just in a different way.  She's an idiot.  Yes, lady.  Listen!  Yes.  Hey!  Listen!  Yes.  Listen to me.  Yes.  All right.  On a serious note.  I heard...  I heard you babbling over the bit saying something about marrying.  No, I said Marion and I feel bad about what happened.  Why can't it just be you feel bad about what happened? 
[01:39:00]  Why does it always have to be you guys...  He's the speaker.  ...have to, like, get together on something before you...  Because Marion can't call you guys all the time.  But you can.  But you can.  So how about you just speak for yourself?  All right.  Well, whatever.  But, you know, I just wanted to say that...  All right.  That I...  Okay.  Feel bad about what happened with Tracy Morgan.  Yeah.  Oh, do you?  I remember him from years ago.  Yeah.  All right?  And I just feel bad and I hope he recovers.  Wow. 
[01:39:30]  Wow.  You've really added a lot to the topic.  I think everyone feels the same as you.  I mean...  I mean...  I wanted to say the same...  I wanted to say the same...  But why do you need to call us to tell us that?  I would assume you would feel bad like anyone else that has ever come in contact or has  any type of relationship with Tracy Morgan.  And one more time.  Marion feels bad, too.  You mean, Paul?  You know, and hearing this call actually makes me envy Tracy right now.  Jimmy, please.  No, it's not funny. 
[01:40:00]  Oh, you shut the hell up.  It's not funny.  You don't know funny?  What do you know about funny?  What do I know about funny?  I listen to you guys, don't I?  You don't...  You don't understand the show.  But you don't really listen to us.  You don't really get it.  You don't really...  You don't get it because it was in the middle of a bit based on your stupidity that was  really, could have went somewhere, and the whole time, Marion!  Marion!  Yeah!  Yelling over him.  You're just like a cat looking at a pinwheel. 
[01:40:30]  You just see the pretty colors, but you don't know the physics behind how it works.  Right.  Okay.  You have no idea why you listen to our show, do you?  No, no.  None.  I was just trying to get a point across.  That's all.  There was no point to...  A point on your head.  What was...  There was no point there.  We could take phone calls all day long from people that are, like, hoping Tracy gets  better.  Yeah.  Well, yeah, that's true, too.  And I hope he does. 
[01:41:00]  Cool.  Thank you for the call.  Your concern has been duly noted.  Oh.  And whoever else survived this terrible crap.  We understand.  Just say all involved.  All involved.  Just say all involved.  Your call has been duly noted.  You know, I want...  That's a wrap-up.  Your concern has been duly noted.  Thank you for the call, and thank you for your...  Oh, Jimmy, come on.  Oh, Jimmy.  Jimmy really doesn't like you.  I do like Di very much.  Not as far as her on the radio show.  No, I love her on the radio show.  I would say not every day, but I do enjoy her on the radio show. 
[01:41:30]  I was very depressed when Lady Di wasn't around for years.  I wanted her badly back on the show.  Oh, boy.  What a mistake that was.  Yeah.  In hindsight.  I like ice cream, but I don't like ice cream every single meal.  I enjoy ice cream once in a while.  What about Marion?  How about this?  Why don't you put a pin in that thought?  Thank you for calling in.  It's been really cool talking to you, but we got some stuff we got to get to, but I appreciate  your concern for Tracy.  He's a great guy, and so is Harris Stanton, and I didn't really know his assistant. 
[01:42:00]  I don't know his assistant, and Artie...  Oh, and James McNair, of course.  James McNair.  I didn't know Jim.  Keith Robinson knew him.  Yeah.  But yes, I appreciate you going yes, yes, over everything.  Thank you, Di.  But we appreciate the call.  Hey, Di.  Be well.  Yes, Sam.  Hey, Di.  Just saying hi.  Hi.  Yeah.  We only take the Lady Di calls when we're running out of material.  No, we aren't.  We have plenty of stuff.  Sterling.  I have more stuff about Sterling.  You do?  Yes.  Hang up on her.  We'll get right to it. 
[01:42:30]  I got more stuff on Sterling.  All right.  Don't hang up on me.  No, we hang up on you, and then we'll come up to Sterling.  Hang up on you?  We'll hang up on you any time we goddamn will please.  Hold on a minute.  Kevin in Houston.  Kevin, go ahead.  Hey, good morning, Gary.  We might have a surprise guest today.  That's true.  Do you know about the surprise guest?  I do not.  For real?  No, but I know that the...  Ant, do you know?  You might know.  Oh, I heard.  I heard.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  No, I don't know.  For real?  Yes.  Don't know.  I do know about the ones that...  Things they tell me, they might want to tell you as well. 
[01:43:00]  They're not hanging up on me.  All right.  Kevin in Houston.  Hey, guys.  We're not going to get a surprise guest.  I just want to...  I don't think so.  That's our surprise guest, possibly.  Oh, okay.  Within a half hour.  I doubt it.  I don't know why we can't announce it, but...  Yeah.  I guess we can.  I guess we can, but...  Why?  No?  All right.  Kevin, go ahead real fast, and then we're going to move on.  All right.  Can Diana please just chill herself and do us all a fucking favor? 
[01:43:30]  Ma'am.  It's not every morning.  It's only when we might be running out of...  No, no, no.  Hold on.  I'm here.  It's every morning.  It's not every morning.  It's every morning.  It's not Friday mornings anymore.  All right.  Let's see.  Stop saying stuff like that wherever you want.  The claims we're dead broke after leaving the White House?  Yep.  Fucking Christ.  I take that.  I think that's bullshit.  Yeah, I mean...  There's no way a president is dead broke leaving the White House.  Yeah.  They said there were a lot of legal bills.  I bet he was in debt. 
[01:44:00]  I bet there was a lot of debt.  But I bet they had money and, you know...  I don't know.  I mean, that's it.  You don't think they're getting envelopes?  Yeah.  You don't think they're getting set up a little bit?  And then there's earnings potential.  Yeah.  You're an ex-president getting out of the White House.  Oh, I'm dead broke.  You make a million dollars for one speaking engagement.  You know, you're pretty much set.  Right off the bat.  Right off the bat.  So, you're not broke.  So, he could...  When was his first speech after the White House?  It's probably like the day after he left. 
[01:44:30]  He put his fucking luggage in the car.  So, that's just a bullshit story.  Yeah.  Maybe technically he was broke, but...  You own property anywhere or a house or...  He was set up nice.  What?  You have the clip.  What?  The audio...  I don't feel like playing the clip.  I'd rather talk to Lady Di.  I wouldn't.  What?  The clip or Lady Di?  Lady Di.  I would not.  All right, Lady Di.  Yes.  Look, I wanted to continue talking to you, but I lost this one.  But I will return. 
[01:45:00]  Oh.  I'm not hanging up.  Oh, we will.  Well, it doesn't work that way.  Yeah, exactly.  Is this happening?  You're fucking rummy.  Oh, you don't know?  We might have Willie Nelson today.  It's stupid to tease it.  Willie Nelson?  What's the problem with telling people that Willie Nelson might stop by?  Why is it always a secret?  Why would that be a problem?  Why would that be a problem, Sam?  Sam?  Sam?  Sam?  Because he's probably not coming.  That's why I said probably.  So why wouldn't...  Then why can't we say, oh, we were supposed to get Willie Nelson? 
[01:45:30]  Yeah.  Because otherwise we would just move on with our show and nobody would realize that our  guest wasn't...  Yeah, but you used that to make people listen a little longer.  Michael Jordan might be stopping by today, too, by the way.  The actor, Michael B. Jordan.  I didn't want to, like, spoil it for the people, but...  Oh.  If we're talking about people that might stop by today, Jordan's on that list today as  well.  He's doing some stuff here in New York, so...  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Sneaker stuff?  Huh?  Sneaker stuff?  No.  Pants?  Oh. 
[01:46:00]  Sneaker stuff.  Hats?  Andrew.  Andrew.  Long Island.  Good morning, gentlemen.  Good morning, Andrew.  We got a Clinton clip we will be playing in a second here.  What do you got?  All right.  Listen, remember that caller who was calling up yesterday saying about, oh, you guys, the  show sucks and all that?  I forgot about him as soon as I left here, but anyway, go ahead.  Yes.  I wanted to call up yesterday and, you know, do that video.  Hillary received $8 million for a book advance while still in the White House. 
[01:46:30]  Yeah.  Where'd that go?  So that was guaranteed money she was going to get, but I guess she didn't get any of  it until she left the White House officially and then maybe she got her first payment?  Well, maybe they're not allowed to take money in the White House.  Maybe the family can't make earnings.  Yeah.  Maybe they're not allowed to.  So you can say you're broke technically, but you're not.  Right.  She's not sleeping in the car.  They were $12 million in debt when leaving office.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  They probably made that up lickety split. 
[01:47:00]  Chelsea's education.  Yeah.  Andrew, thanks for your call, by the way.  All right.  So.  The guy that got resolved right there.  I thought he had a great call there.  They had to pay off debts and houses and take care of family members.  Right.  And they had a helping hand.  Wealthy Clinton pal Terry McAuliffe loaned them $1.3 million for the purchase of a home.  And they went on to earn an astonishing $109 million between 2000 and 2007. 
[01:47:30]  That's called bouncing back.  That is quite the bounce back.  They were never broke, broke.  $34 million.  How did they only pay?  Wait a minute.  They paid $34 million in taxes over that time.  How do you only pay $34 million in taxes on $109 million in income?  Right.  Deductions.  Right.  But why?  You know, if you're kind of.  Hmm.  Yeah.  Well, they're apparently using every legal loophole that they can use to save some of their money. 
[01:48:00]  Mm-hmm.  Are they doing their fair share?  Yeah, I mean, 30, that's like, what is it, 30%?  I love that.  Great.  It's, eh, it's bullshit.  Good for you!  Oh, you know what, dude?  Legal debts, too.  The Paula Jones thing, there was all this stuff.  He had like $5 million in legal debts.  Yeah.  Uh, during a series of actions of, uh, Whitewater, oh yeah, Paula Jones in an impeachment trial.  But the point is this.  When they were sitting in the White House still, and they knew they had some of this debt, they  also knew they were set.  Totally set.  That as soon as they got out, they would be able to, uh, you know, make their money. 
[01:48:30]  We got this.  We're on the motherfucker.  I don't think they were ever nervous, like, like real people are, when they are in actual  debt.  Yeah.  With their electricity being turned off.  It, they were never in any fucking trouble.  Like, if we don't get re-signed, we can't go out and make million dollar speaking engagements.  Yeah, yeah.  Of course.  That's it.  Tell, tell them niggas to chill out.  The wolf will arrive shortly.  He was all set up.  He's fine.  By the way, the Lady Di phone calls have helped people. 
[01:49:00]  This guy was off the wagon, uh, after ten years of sobriety, then listening to Lady Di  got, got him sober again.  Congrats.  He's serious, too.  Dead serious about it.  Here's Hillary Clinton talking about, uh, Benghazi.  His voice.  Is there anything you personally should have been doing to make it safer in Benghazi?  Well, what I did was give very direct instructions that the people who have the expertise and experience 
[01:49:30]  in security apply it.  Well, that is personal, though, Diane.  I mean, I am not, um, I'm not equipped to sit and look at blueprints, um, to determine  where the blast walls need to be or where the reinforcements need to be.  That's why we hire people who have that expertise.  There you go.  That's good.  What is it she's bullshitting about?  That's the old buck.  Uh, how long her and, uh, the upper echelon of Obama's administration, including Obama  himself, knew that, uh, the security at the, um, embassy was not up to, uh, snuff. 
[01:50:00]  Okay.  And, and that Americans were sitting ducks and that there were terrorist threats and  they were actual real live terrorists that, uh, for the purpose of the anniversary of  9-11 attacked a United States embassy and killed United States citizens and soldiers.  Um, and it wasn't because of a, uh, Muslim, uh, insulting video. 
[01:50:30]  So, oh, that's right.  That's fucking, the way that people blame that guy.  Yeah.  It's all about blame.  Anything to take the, uh, the, the thing off the fact that, yeah, they attacked us again.  That they got attacked because the election was coming up and they did not want, uh, Obama  was saying, you know, oh, we've defeated terrorism and, and tell the Taliban and Al Qaeda and  everybody.  And, uh, we really don't have to worry about that anymore.  And, uh, the fact of the matter was that they were able to kill Americans, blow up an 
[01:51:00]  embassy, uh, burn it, um, on the anniversary of 9-11.  And, uh, her job was not to go through blueprints of blast walls, but her job was to, uh, receive  communications from, uh, people and, and make sure that they're protected.  She's the secretary of state and the president of the, of the United States should have known  better. 
[01:51:30]  It was a very volatile area.  I'm starting to think you don't like the Obama administration.  I love it.  I got my suspicions.  Mm.  Uh, Hillary had this to say too.  Oh.  It has been reported you've made 5 million making speeches.  The president's made more than a hundred million dollars.  Well, well.  But you hear Diane Sawyer.  I know.  What the fuck?  Why are you surprised by that?  Yeah, why are you surprised?  She, and she almost sounds like she's chastising her for it. 
[01:52:00]  Good.  Good for Hillary if she could go out and bilk people for 5 million bucks for opening that  horrid yap of hers and letting that drivel spill out over the podium.  Fuck her.  She's a very natural and genuine speaker.  Uh, I said, well, what was that line?  Ah, something no way is tired.  No way is tired.  Do we have that fucking awful clip?  I love listening to it.  One second.  It's terrible.  You got it. 
[01:52:30]  I'm in no way tired.  Yuck.  Trying to talk.  She was addressing a bunch of black people.  A black church, yeah.  So she decided that she's going to sound black.  Oh, here it is.  Young Samuel has it.  Oh.  I hope.  Yes.  Well, over the weekend, Senator Clinton had her campaign.  I don't feel no ways tired.  I've come too far.  Oh.  From where I started from.  Nobody told me that the road would be easy. 
[01:53:00]  Oh.  I don't believe he brought me this far.  Oh.  Believe me.  Oh.  Hillary Wigger.  That, but that's, that's the secretary of state.  She wants to run for president.  Yeah.  Who changes her inflection.  Exactly.  Depending on the audience she's speaking to.  Oh.  Hi.  Y'all motherfuckers are crazy.  Where are my niggas at?  Thank you, Madam President. 
[01:53:30]  Foreign policy can kiss my motherfucking ass.  Thank you, Madam President.  I'm mad at her.  Ah, he's fucking A.  Disgusting.  She's 15-year-old Jimmy Norton.  Can't go ass.  Yeah, exactly.  Fat laces on her secretary of state old lady shoes.  Fat orthotic laces.  She continues.  Well, if, if you, you have no reason to remember, but we came out of the White House not only  dead broke, but in debt. 
[01:54:00]  We had no money when we got there, and we struggled to, you know, piece together the resources for  mortgages, for houses, for Chelsea's education.  You know, it was not easy.  Wasn't easy.  That's just a lie.  First of all, it's bullshit.  That is a complete lie.  She, she knows it was, uh, they were set up.  It might not have been easy for the first weekend.  Yeah.  That's just, she's just lying.  Earning potential of millions of dollars isn't quite enough for the Clintons, so she, I guess 
[01:54:30]  she really understands what the middle class is all about.  Yeah, she was on food stamps.  Yeah.  That, that is just not true.  Yeah.  You know, it was not easy.  Bill has worked really hard, and it's been amazing to me.  He's worked very hard.  First of all, we had to pay off all our debts.  Worked hard on that intern.  Get it?  I bet he did.  Get it?  He jizzed all over her dress.  You bet he did.  Remember?  He windmilled a cigar into her pussy. 
[01:55:00]  She won't talk about that, by the way.  No?  Nope.  Oh, why?  Hillary won't even address it.  What?  She's telling every interviewer that she, uh, talks to, I will not discuss the, the, uh,  situation.  So they should still bring it up.  They do, and she goes, I will not talk about that.  You've seen that?  I've moved on.  You've seen clips of her that are actually saying that?  Yep.  I heard it this morning on 10-10 wins.  And technically, pardon me, it is her private life, and it's her husband, but, oh boy, wasn't  there an impeachment over that?  It was huge, yeah. 
[01:55:30]  It was a big, big public, uh, debacle.  There was, uh, yeah, there was an issue there.  A bit of an issue.  First of all, we had to pay off all our debts, which was, you know, you had to make double  the money, because of, obviously, taxes, and then pay off the debts, and get us houses,  and take care of family members.  But do you think Americans are going to understand five times the median income in this country  for one speech?  Well, let me put it this way.  Oh, right.  I thought making speeches for money was a much better thing than getting connected with 
[01:56:00]  any one group or company, as so many people who leave public life do.  Whether you like her or don't, who gives a fuck that she's making that much money off  a speech?  I have no problem with that.  People want to see her talk.  People want to pay it.  Right.  If they want to pay it, so be it.  People want to see her talk.  There's nothing wrong with that.  I'm not a fan of Hillary Clinton.  Oh, really?  I'm not a fan of...  That's your boy.  I'm not a fan of most of these people.  I understand she's coming to the building, but she'll only do shade. 
[01:56:30]  We come too far.  How could a president go broke?  Exactly.  No one's buying it.  Most people aren't buying that they were actually broke.  It was tough.  It wasn't tough.  It was tough because you had to live like a normal, not a normal person, but like a person  outside the White House.  So I guess the tough part was going, holy fuck, we've got to get an actual mortgage now.  Yeah.  After eight years or even longer, right?  They probably had free housing before they were the president. 
[01:57:00]  Oh, yeah.  In the White House, I mean.  So that was probably what she's talking about.  Like, wait, we actually got to get a mortgage.  Buy a house, yeah.  So we got to find a guy, I guess.  And wait, wait, we might have to get a student loan.  Oh, for Chelsea?  See, I'm not a student loan.  Come on.  They didn't have to get a loan or any of that shit.  But they had to set that up as well.  Like, wait, how are we going to pay for our schooling?  This is stuff we never had to think about.  Five million in legal debts.  So you think that someone takes care of that for the president?  But I guess not.  I guess when it's personal lawsuits, you get it. 
[01:57:30]  Yeah, there's accountants and lawyers working on it, I'm sure.  And they crunched the numbers and said, you get out there and you do a few speeches.  We'll pay this off.  Those debts were gone really quickly.  Extremely quickly.  109 million.  So it's just lies.  And what was the whole thing she lied about, too, going into the...  I'm sorry, guys.  I have a tickle in my throat.  I hope it's not cancer.  What is that...  Comedian jokes himself at the hospital. 
[01:58:00]  See the fucking headline if I did have it?  Big C.  What is the...  She lied about going into that fucking day thing.  That war zone.  On a plane, right?  She's like, they were shooting.  Yes, they were shooting.  She was landing.  Was it Iraq?  No.  At the time.  Oh, right.  She was flying into a war zone.  I think it was Bosnia.  Where she said she was sniped at or something, right?  Yeah, they were shooting or something.  And then it proved to be wrong.  Yeah, they said it was not true.  Wow.  She was actually just... 
[01:58:30]  Yeah, leisurely fucking flight into some city.  She was on a fucking united flight.  Yeah, into LaGuardia.  Right.  Yeah.  I don't know.  It's just depressing to watch these people ramble on.  I think the tinkled desk sort of, yeah.  I think she's just, obviously, just stretching the truth.  You want to share a urinal?  Not in a gay way, but just because this way we save water.  That is a good answer to that.  Yeah.  It's awkward.  Maybe we bring in like a little apple box and can stand on it and the three of us can 
[01:59:00]  just wee into the same one.  Do that.  I'm going to pee on the Mike Richter hockey puck is what I'm going to do.  Oh, man.  Come on.  Rangers got another game in them.  They could pull it out.  Yeah, the Kings might do what's called lose on purpose so they could hoist the cup in L.A.  So I would not be surprised whatsoever if they lose the next game.  That's taking a chance, throwing the game like that so you can, I don't know.  Your boys are done.  Your boys are done. 
[01:59:30]  Hey, I'll never give up on my Rangers.  I've been through 20 years of this.  Yeah.  Have you?  Yeah, it's 20 years.  Of the radio show?  Yeah.  It's the last time the Rangers won the cup.  We just started.  We just started.  That's how long we've been at this.  Oh, man.  They're doing the O.J. chase on TV.  When is that?  Tonight?  Tomorrow?  Are they really showing it?  Yeah, I think it's kind of, I think they're going to, they should do it in real time. 
[02:00:00]  Wow.  That would be kind of cool.  O.J.  Yeah.  Who would be the anchor back then?  Bernard, who was the black guy?  Bernie.  Bernie.  Yes, Bernie.  Bernard Shaw.  Bernard Shaw.  Oh, wow.  Was he involved with the O.J. chase?  CNN.  It was a biggie.  Who were some of those other CNN guys back in the day?  Well, Blitzer was there.  Yeah, Wolfie was.  Yeah.  It was a CBS News special report.  Dan Rather.  Dan Rather.  John Blackstone in New York, John Blackstone in Los Angeles, along with our colleagues at KCBS, who arranged this extraordinary, the live police tale of what is believed to be. 
[02:00:30]  I won't fuck any woman who remembers this.  And when people started holding the signs up, go O.J.  That's amazing.  Like, because after a while watching this, you kind of knew where he was going.  Right.  So they lined the streets and the bridges over the freeway with signs that said, go O.J. 
[02:01:00]  Remember when he turned into his neighborhood?  Yeah.  I was like, oh, fuck.  Now he's got to make some moves.  Yeah.  This was so fucking weird.  This part was easy.  Cuts his wife's throat, but people like him because he ran a football well.  Yes.  That's it.  Almost decapitates his fucking wife.  No one wanted to believe it.  Even Al Michaels, I think at the time, didn't want to believe it.  Yeah.  They were close.  It's hard.  If your friend kills someone, how do you handle it?  Man.  I snuck a peek at some of those crime photos last night. 
[02:01:30]  Oh, right.  Ugh.  Really?  God, what a disastrous mess.  So obvious it was him.  Like, no one just kills someone like that.  There's no murders that happen like that where some random person comes up and butchers the woman and this guy that's with her unless it's personal.  That's like a, it's such a textbook thing that that was a crime of passion.  And O.J. having this history of anger and jealousy with her, that he did it. 
[02:02:00]  And then all the other evidence.  How this motherfucker walked on that is astounding.  I don't know.  That whole glove thing.  Oh, they showed that whole thing.  That's the prosecutors.  You stop that circus and go, wait a minute.  You're not trying this on properly.  That's, uh...  Instead, they're all like looking in amazement.  That's what Ron Goldman's dad, what's his name?  Fred Goldman.  Freddie Goldman there.  He was commenting on 20 years.  Oh, he was?  Yeah, he only calls O.J. the killer. 
[02:02:30]  Right.  He won't call him O.J. Simpson or anything.  Does he still have the mustache?  He just calls him the killer.  Oh, yeah.  I love that father.  He's got the big mustache.  And, uh...  Yeah, he was saying that, uh...  He doesn't blame the prosecution.  Uh...  It was a weird time.  Uh...  But things like that glove really got him.  Right.  Because the dried blood on it, and then putting latex gloves on O.J., and having him try to  put the glove on...  I'm not a lawyer, but if you make the guy put a plastic glove on first, wouldn't that 
[02:03:00]  raise your suspicion?  Like, wait a minute, that's going to be a...  It's going to be a problem.  Because those type of gloves, too, you know, they were supposed to fit snug to begin with.  Yeah.  There weren't those fitting gloves that you just throw on in the middle of the winter  to throw a few snowballs?  The Mark Furman thing, he talked about that, too, and said, uh, you know, if Mark Furman  had, uh...  Because times are really bad between the LAPD and the black community there.  Right.  So he said, if Mark Furman had lied and said he hadn't said nigger back years ago, then 
[02:03:30]  they would have exposed him as a lying racist.  Right.  And if he tells the truth, then he's a racist.  So there was no way he was getting any credibility.  He said...  And the thought that he planted evidence, I think he said he was the 33rd police officer  on that scene.  And he plants evidence after 32 other officers walked around the scene and were looking for  evidence.  Was Van Adder the lead detective on that case?  Yeah, yeah.  It was James Van Adder, I think his name was? 
[02:04:00]  Yep.  Just, uh, you know, in hindsight, you forget how much of the detail there was and how obvious  it was that he did it.  Wasn't this our first, like, look at Court?  Like, like, no one, in our lifetimes, we never saw anything.  This invented Court TV, didn't it?  Pretty much.  I think Court TV blossomed out of the OJ trial.  But yeah, we used to get little glimpses of cases on specials and things like that, documentaries 
[02:04:30]  maybe.  But never in real time, day-to-day, that grind of a courtroom, uh, just put out there live.  Marsha Clark just fucking stinking on ice.  When she tried to gussy herself up and get that makeover halfway through the trial.  That shitty, rotten perm.  More important to her was, was, uh, people criticizing her looks than actually prosecuting  the fucking case.  Oh, she was the worst.  Chris Darden stunk.  Ah, just an emasculated, uh, brother. 
[02:05:00]  Right.  Sitting there while, you know, Johnny Cochran just played him.  Yeah.  Cochran was a good fucking lawyer, man.  Cochran, you know.  And so was Barry Schott.  What a scumbag.  But man, did he know exactly what to do.  Yeah, he knew exactly what to do.  He made fools of the prosecution.  Yeah.  And then I guess the next, the other thing that's coming out on this 20th anniversary  of this whole thing is Kardashian.  Um, uh, Goldman said that Kardashian absolutely took a bag full of it. 
[02:05:30]  There was no evidence and it disappeared and no one ever knew what happened to it.  And he took it to his deathbed.  Um, he grabbed a bunch of stuff out of OJ's house, had it in a bag.  It's actually on video somewhere.  Right.  I remember seeing, remember seeing him leave the house with a bag.  What did he say it was?  Never said it.  Never said what it was.  How did he not call him?  Never said anything.  Never had to say what it was.  Never.  Didn't they call him into the, uh, trial?  Oh, he was, he was on the Dream Team.  He was one of the attorneys.  Who?  Uh, Robert Kardashian. 
[02:06:00]  Oh, that's right.  He was the attorney.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So he had, you know, attorney-client privilege, I guess.  Is that why they made him one of the Dream Team lawyers?  Maybe.  Attorney-client privilege?  Maybe.  But then again, doesn't attorney-client privilege get nullified if there's a crime committed?  Like, didn't Bruce Cutler, like, didn't he get in trouble?  I'm not saying it's ethical.  Oh, okay.  If he doesn't, uh, it's something called, uh, discovery, I guess.  Oh.  And, and whatever evidence, uh, the prosecution finds, they have to give over to the defense. 
[02:06:30]  I learned that from, um, uh, my cousin Vinny.  And, uh, no, but, uh, but, but if you just hide the evidence,  or destroy it, or bury it somewhere, uh, you know.  But Goldman says he absolutely had evidence that would have convicted O.J.,  and he destroyed it.  That broke up the marriage, too.  Because Robert Kardashian was, uh, all for O.J., and, uh, what's her name?  Kris Jenner, right?  Right.  Yeah.  Was, uh, that was her friend that was murdered. 
[02:07:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, people forget that.  Or people don't even know.  People that watch the Kardashians, they have no idea that the father was, you know.  Most of them have no idea the father was on one of the biggest trials, uh, ever.  The girls were all very young back then.  They were all 10, 11, 12 years old, somewhere around there.  Wow.  Yep.  Someone's saying that, uh, O.J. stopped taking his arthritis medication two days before the trial,  so his hands would swell up.  Oh, well, he could have done that.  Is that one of those conspiracy theories out there?  I never heard that one. 
[02:07:30]  You think someone saw that coming?  Like, well, they might make you put the glove on.  You'd think the lawyers would be on high alert that, you know, this might not go well,  so let's be prepared.  I gotta pee.  Yeah, I gotta pee, too.  Oh, man.  Come on.  Right.  All right.  All right.  We'll return.  We'll be back with more Opie and Anthony.  I dare you to change the channel.  Please don't.  The Half Hour is back.  I thought he's a fight.

Millions of people are suffering from constipation and hemorrhoids. 
[02:11:00]  Are you one of them?  Hello, I'm Dr. Roger Sidoi,  and as a gastroenterologist, I've been telling my patients for years  that in order to keep things moving,  you need to eat fiber, drink plenty of water, and exercise.  Now I tell my patients to elevate their knees above their waist  with the Squatty Potty footstool when they go.  Here's why.  Anatomically, humans were designed to squat,  but then we started sitting,  and sitting brought on problems like constipation and hemorrhoids.  So the real problem is how we sit.  That's why I recommend the Squatty Potty.  The Squatty Potty is so simple 
[02:11:30]  because it helps you elevate your knees  while enjoying the comfort of your own toilet.  Plus, the Squatty Potty is for everyone,  not only those with problems.

[02:16:30]  Leave your penis alone.  The Opie and Anthony  show is back on.  That's hilarious, really?  Yeah, fuck them.  See, that's why I mentioned  that we might get  Willie Nelson,  so then when it  doesn't happen,  it really fucking hurts.  I saw Liam 
[02:17:00]  walking down the hall  with some really  tasty pastries  and a really nice  fruit bowl,  fruit salad,  whatever,  and I said,  who's that for?  And he goes,  oh, that was  for Willie Nelson,  but he obviously  didn't touch it.  Yeah.  Willie Nelson  has officially  left the building,  so I guess  he's not doing our show.  Where's Roland?  That's why I would  have to be a surprise guest  because probably  we don't want it  to get back.  I think it's better  that we did bring it up. 
[02:17:30]  Oh, yeah, exactly.  I kind of believed  that it was going to happen.  I knew it wasn't.  Why?  We had him on  one other time.  I just knew it wasn't.  We had him on  at N.E.W.  He brought in  that old guitar of his  with the big hole in it  because he's been  playing it forever.  That was a long time ago.  His tour bus  was parked outside N.E.W.  He was getting high  before the interview.  Oh, yeah.  Right?  Maybe I didn't love you.  Shut up.  It's a good song.  I would have said,  hey, did you like  when Elvis covered that?  I liked it. 
[02:18:00]  Fuck him.  What's wrong with you?  Fuck him.  He's one of our  national treasures,  Willie Nelson.  Is he?  Yeah.  He puts corn in his  gas tank, too.  Some kind of corn.  Check it out now.  I'm Willie R. Nelson.  Thank you, Jim.  Oh, well.  What are you going to do?  Let's say hi to Ivan  in Scranton.  Then we got a call  from Denmark.  Ivan, what do you want?  What's up, Ivan?  What's going on, guys?  What's up, Ivan?  Nothing. 
[02:18:30]  I know you guys  always like to  not really rag,  but you guys bust on  Adam Sandler quite a bit.  Well, maybe.  I think the world's  starting to realize  that he might have  ran out of creative juice.  That last movie  didn't do too well, huh?  No, not too well.  It came and went.  I was at a casino  up in the Poconos  and I ran into  the guy that plays  Shooter McGavin.  Oh, what's his real name?  He's been in a lot of shit.  Shooter McGavin.  Yeah, so I ran into him  and he was at the bar  just drinking  and me and a couple  of my buddies were there  and we're just hanging out 
[02:19:00]  and I kind of knew  who he was  but I didn't want to  freak him out  and be all over him  and stuff.  So we're just sitting  there drinking.  So that means you left  the bar and you went  somewhere else.  Right.  Is that what happened?  That's how that story  should end, by the way.  Yes.  So what was your move  that he's probably seen  a million times  and went,  here's another asshole  that's going to bother me  and all I want is a beer.  What was your move?  Not, I mean,  I didn't really have a move.  I just kind of just sat there  and he was sitting, 
[02:19:30]  he was sitting like two sheets down  and I told him,  I actually said like,  oh yeah,  I know who you are.  I didn't call him  Shooter McGavin.  I know who you are.  Of course you know  who he is.  And I bet you thought  he would be excited  to talk about  Happy Gilmore.  Yeah,  I'm Shooter McGavin.  Right.  Do the hands,  do the gun hands.  Right.  That's where we're getting it.  That's where we're getting it.  He ended up staying for a while  and we ended up bullshitting  and we ended up playing pool.  Oh, that's cool. 
[02:20:00]  We sat there  and we started playing pool  and we got down to the last shot  and I had the eight ball.  I shot it in  and as soon as I sunk it,  I did the shooter thing  with the fingers  and then he called me an asshole  and he left.  All right.  That's fair.  That's kind of a good  Shooter McGavin story to have.  Yeah, that's a good story.  Yeah.  What the hell?  All right, guys,  I'm punching out.  Thanks a lot.  All right.  Roll, roll.  Punch yourself out in the face.  What happened with the Willie Nelson?  He's on the road again.  Oh, Rollins. 
[02:20:30]  That's a good one.  He doesn't remember us  from years past.  What happened?  That's too bad.  We had a good time with him.  I remember that.  That was one of the good ones.  He was very tired,  so we're going to reschedule  for another time.  Oh, fuck that.  Yeah, reschedule.  Reschedule.  Okay, cool.  You're always on my mind.  He's one.  When's he coming back?  Like, yeah.  Maybe I won't do your show.  You don't like Willie Nelson?  Probably grossly that before.  Maybe I love you.  Quite as often as I could have. 
[02:21:00]  Quite as often as I could have.  Oh, could have.  Whatever.  Smoke another joint.  Maybe I didn't read you.  Fucking take your braid out.  Elvis did a killer cover this year.  Did you ever hear it?  No.  I love a good cover,  as I've said before in this program.  If I made you feel sick of me.  Well, so he's, um... 
[02:21:30]  That's all right.  So we weren't on his mind, right?  Exactly.  You are never on my mind.  You're on the list that's pain-o-mind.  Did you think it was going to happen, Roland?  You can all kiss my behind.  You felt pretty good about it, right?  I felt pretty good.  And then they said he was tired.  I mean...  Oh, boy.  They're old.  They get tired.  Yeah, no.  We could, you know...  We would talk to him for 15 minutes.  We didn't say, sit down.  We have a two-hour fucking Q&A with you.  Gunpoint.  The old people, they make up their minds, 
[02:22:00]  and they go...  Yeah.  Yeah.  Ah, and there he is.  On the road again.  Yeah.  Just can't wait to get on the road again.  Yeah.  Yeah, why fucking do our show?  Exactly.  She sure can't wait to get on our show again.  Oh, no.  Their show.  I'm sorry.  Their show.  Going places that I've never been in.  Dun, dun, dun.  Like where?  This studio?

[02:34:00]  we were done with that  do you want to hear  Snoop and Willie Nelson  no  oh fuck  what is it  we played it before  it's called  my medicine  that's what I meant  but I didn't  where is Willie Nelson  in that though  I'd rather hear  his Hot Pockets  fucking song  I love this song  but is he actually  singing on it  everything I'm reading  says he's in it  yeah Willie  Willie's in this  oh  yeah  you know I got  the head at medicine  I don't remember  where  you know what he means  by medicine right  oh weed  she bought  are you sure 
[02:34:30]  weed  you know right  oh yeah  a little subtle  a little subtle  it is subtle  ah  cause that's the only reason  he did something  with Willie  they're both known  for weed  so they gotta  they gotta sing  a song about  weed  buy my medicine  buy my medicine  his medicine  the more dedicated  the more medicated  ah  I do like though  that he's got his girl  going out to whore for him  to buy his drugs 
[02:35:00]  yeah  and this is not about  weed by the way  this is about  fucking like dope  shooting dope  yeah  yeah  are you sure  100%  cause he's talking  about a spoon  oh he does say  spoon in there  yeah in the beginning  oh boy  and his girlfriend  is out  fucking hooking  proving marijuana  is a gateway  drug there  chicks never  hook for pot  he write a nice  song about  the sunshine  godsmack's got  a new song out  someone just told me  on twitter  yeah they're in town  now  they are  yeah I've talked  to some of his  friends  they should have 
[02:35:30]  stopped by  silly stops by  when he's doing  solo stuff  let me hear the  new godsmack song  we go way back  with these guys  15 years at least  right  something like  that  well from the  time you threw  their cassette  out the window  of your truck  well it happens  97 we probably  met him soon  17 years ago  we know  we know  only 17 years  yeah  let me hear  a little godsmack  it's tough to  put out a rocks  arm these days  it's really tough  what is it called 
[02:36:00]  1000 hp  sounds like  godsmack  not changing  the formula  good for those  boys  time to rewind 
[02:36:30]  back to 1995  where we were  nothing  yeah  it's one of those  oh my god  it's absolutely  could you pause  it  I gotta say  his voice sounds  amazing though  yeah  I have to say  that  dude  this is exactly  like the songs  jimmy writes  about bands  that were popular 
[02:37:00]  but did they break up  and get back  no really  well you went solo  dude this is  it takes time  to do a little solo  this is we're back  talking  this is we're back  and better than ever  we're back  I don't think  they officially  ever broke up  but they've been gone  it's been a while  since they put out a song  did you hear what he says  what  he says  you know  wind it back to 1995  wind it back  the bars we played  in Boston  this is all  oh it's the douchey stuff  give it a chance  please  just play a song  don't wax fantastic 
[02:37:30]  about 95  go ahead  go ahead  go ahead  go ahead  go ahead  go ahead  turn that shit  on  make it  all  go  faster  play it  through the  witching hour  take it  to a thousand  horsepower  yeah  I like this 
[02:38:00]  let's see if he continues on that  did he sound like the beginning of bad religion  I don't know  a little bit  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh 
[02:38:30]  obey your master  oh  that's a lot of horses  yes  chip 
[02:39:00]  that's a lot of horses  oh  this part  I like it  I do too  they're basically telling the world they're not done just yet 
[02:39:30]  well that's what I've got from that  do you understand what's going on here  I heard yes  let's bring it back to 95 and let's not forget  I heard  let's not forget what we've been through  we're back  and we're better than ever  we're back together forever  we're back  we're back  they're not necessarily saying they're back  no  no  I think maybe there's some chat around  with people thinking that they might be done  and Sully's here to say  hell not  literally  wow 
[02:40:00]  turn that shit  on  I absolutely don't like the beginning of the song at all  but then it's  but now it's cool  I don't think they had to do that whole 95 thing  they certainly did  oh there's a ball sit and all that  yeah I didn't like that part at all  but then it kicks in and it's good  I'd like the rest of it  it'll get used for a video game commercial 
[02:40:30]  or  WWE pay-per-view  Sully sounds great  17, 18 years later  holy fuck  sounds great  his voice sounds good  well produced  everyone's in their position  playing their instruments  yeah  just a little hokey  a little hokey  yeah the beginning  95  both verses  back in Boston  playing the club  I'm talking about like  being a hit overnight  you know  because of Rocco  yeah  instead of us 
[02:41:00]  Rocco didn't throw the tape out the window  yeah  oh well  it is a true story  we got so many tapes  what are we gonna do  I don't know  listen to every one  it's hard man  people hand you their stuff  and I feel bad  I'm like what am I gonna do with this  terrible  Jesus  99.9% of it's shit  I threw it out the window over a bridge  just to make my friend laugh  that's all  it had nothing to even do with Sully  because I  ah whatever  why am I trying to spin this  because I've always been a really big Godsmack fan 
[02:41:30]  always liked those guys a lot  but it was about making my friend laugh  it was their demo tape  and I even thought to myself  there's gotta be other copies of this around  it was their demo tape  Godsmack's demo  he had a few  he burned a few  oh boy  he didn't just burn one for us  you know Rocco listened to it  and was like  dude these guys rock  I'm gonna play him on my show  and he gets the  breaking Godsmack story  yeah Sully has credited Rocco 
[02:42:00]  many times  mm-hmm  yeah  could have that little credit  oh well  what are you gonna do  yeah  we did show him shit videos though  so  we have our own history with him  that's true  German shit videos  yeah before you could get him anywhere really  right  he was amazed  now there were a dime a dozen  you had to buy a fishbowl  and make him yourself  when I was your age  I had to get your mother to shit on a fishbowl  if I wanted to see a log coming out  you kids have it easy  fishbowl  yeah  alright  you break the fishbowl with a mallet 
[02:42:30]  and you put your head in there  oh  and then mother shits on it  mother  there's been a lot of hate in the last half hour  so let's organize this shit  Willie Nelson  yeah  thumbs up or down  I'm going to thumbs down  still hating him  yep  I'm hating  uh  Cy and uh  the Snoop Dogg  that is a  hangover  towering  steaming lump of shite  stinks  Seth Rogen and uh  Snoop doing the  the Game of Thrones  that was funny  okay  that was funny  enjoyable  and then finally 
[02:43:00]  Godsmack  I liked the music  I liked Sully's voice  I liked the band  uh  the  the vocals in that first verse  were too hokey  I think it throws you off  but I think the rest of the song  is pretty cool  the rest of the song is kind of cool  I swear that's my real  yeah  review  oh boy  the consumer  sorry the consumer  oh  hashtag  the consumer  the consumer  yeah  dare I do a review  yeah  that's his bit  right  yes  why don't you buy yourself a nice bag of fetid toenails 
[02:43:30]  enjoy them  I was ready to be with you on the Godsmack thing  after that first  I know  that first verse  and then I'm like  you know what  no man  this is alright  it rocked  that first part I just didn't like  like it was 1995  maybe they could re-edit it  just because we say so  E-Rock  didn't the new Godsmack  kind of sound like when  Pendulum was redone  sort of that  dun dun dun dun  like  well it's that sound  and that fake  grunge rock  yeah but the Pendulum guy  was going for the 
[02:44:00]  it's that sound  yeah  he was going for that sound  yeah  right  he was going for the  kind of Godsmack thing  which was you know  it's just tough to be a rock band these days  especially if you were around in the 90s  tough  it's  I'm sure Godsmack still sells a lot of tickets  they're classic fucking rock man  like fucking  90s is classic rock  80s is oldies  fucking oldies  crazy  I don't even know what the 70s are  they're almost hip again 
[02:44:30]  70s came back around  70s styles  and all that shit  now  usually takes about 35-40 years  then the generation grows up  and their kids are like  wow that was kind of cool  yeah  it's like rockabilly  dig through their parents' shit  and find something  and think it's cool  do you like rockabilly?  hate it  I never liked rockabilly  me neither  I mean a couple Stray Cats songs  were kind of alright  as pop songs  but  I don't like that style at all  won't be rocking this town  no 
[02:45:00]  I was talking to the lead singer of Gollum yesterday  who was featured in the Louis C.K. episode last night  which I still haven't seen  the band  I don't know how they did  but  she's excited  because she got the big Louis C.K. show  it's this  this like kind of Yiddish type of music  oh right  yes  with fucking  accordions  and all sorts of stuff  they're really talented  a local band called Gollum  or Gollum  how do you say their name  whatever  G-O-L-L-U-M  I don't know 
[02:45:30]  Gollum maybe  and I was talking to her yesterday  because  I just know her  or whatever  oh  and  our kids kind of  might be going to the same school  oh  I see  and  she's excited  but she's like  no one buys  CDs anymore  or even downloads  them for money anymore  because of Spotify  how the fuck  did Spotify happen  how did managers allow that to happen  and what is Spotify  I mean I know what Spotify is  but what  how much do you pay  you paid like ten dollars 
[02:46:00]  and you could just listen to  whatever the fuck you want  right  well you can get it for free  and you can listen with ads  right  or  you pay ten bucks a month  and yeah  you listen to whatever you want  it's streaming  but you can also download  within the app  they pay  they must pay royalties  oh she says  dirt cheap  it's like  not even pennies on the dollar  it's like  there's a band  it's like fractions of pennies on the dollar  there was  there was a band  that figured out  how to make money off of it though  yeah  they put out an album  on Spotify  that had no music on it 
[02:46:30]  and then they got  all their fans  to listen to it  while they were asleep  so all their fans  listened to it  for eight hours  and you get paid  per stream  and it goes in a cycle  so they had thousands of people  do this  and it was on  and so Spotify  had to pay them  however many thousand dollars  brilliant  yeah  but don't they  like Bette Midler  had so many plays  and that they  and they gave her  some shit check  like they pay nothing  right  the artists get fucked on that 
[02:47:00]  and then I was  talking to some other people  and like  if you're  if you're 30 even  you don't even understand  what a disc jockey is  or like  listening to a radio station  you have no real concept  you know it happened  but you have no  you don't have any  personal experience  because you know  anyone from 30  and younger  they were downloading  all their own music  and basically making  their own like radio station  they can't be bothered  to sit through nonsense  to maybe hear  their favorite song  they can't be bothered  to actually listen  to a DJ  talking between songs 
[02:47:30]  they don't understand  that world at all  yeah Napster started  early in high school  so then once  Napster started  then CD Burners  came out right after that  so 30  I mean definitely  like 30  no not 30  so you go the other way  so like 25  late 20s  25  to the late 20s  those people have  no concept  of just listening  to your favorite  radio station  and having loyalty  to that  and having loyalty  to an actual  music show  don't need any  of that shit  of course  yeah the world  has changed 
[02:48:00]  and Spotify  is really fucking it up  for these artists  well it's not about  album sales anymore  it's about getting popular  and getting rants  out on the road  and fucking touring  making money that way  she's not one of those  she's got a family  eh well sorry  this is her experience  she's got a family  in New York City  she goes  you know how we make money  she was featured  on Louie's show  last night  and they do tour  to like Mexico  and other places  they've been to like Paris  and a few other joints  and they're a wedding band  oh yeah  they're a wedding band 
[02:48:30]  she goes  that's how we make our money  we go out every weekend  as a wedding band  and they're way  no offense to wedding bands  shit  you can't say anything  on the show  look I already stopped myself  no offense to wedding bands  but they are  they are  in a different  they're  oh yeah  they're on a different  I'll just say trip  than the average wedding band  yeah  they're very original  with their shit  so I thought  I thought it was fascinating  because I thought  I was excited for them  like hey man  this will lead to some downloads  for you  some nice pocket money  she goes  not at all 
[02:49:00]  people just do not  download  you know  music anymore  certainly they're not  really paying for it  or if they are  it's like  nothing  yeah you gotta go on the road  and you gotta get endorsements  right  that's it  that's what it's all about  so  it's a whole nother  ball game  get some fancy stickers  and shirts  stickers  shirts  you fucking shit  you god damn tour  right  get on the road  right  on the road again  oh boy  and the laptop goes 
[02:49:30]  oh  you just called it  that's it  good for you  I like the really  Nelson  that's too bad  maybe next time  yeah  maybe next time  that's a shame  that's a bit of a shame  what are you gonna do  oh he's tired  well  he's 81  jesus  we're all tired  exactly  he's 81 tired  that's a different type  of time  81 tired  81 tired  you can bitch  and I certainly do enough of it  I can bitch about being tired 
[02:50:00]  but 81 tired  is a whole different game  that's like waiting till  you wait till noon  until you can feel your feet  or something  you know  it just takes forever  that must be like  the worst case  you've ever had  of when you're driving  and you're falling asleep  at the wheel  sure  but just being like that  all the time  81 tired  I think you might get  two good hours a day  where you're like  you know what  I feel pretty good  I'm feeling pretty  yeah  full of vim and vigor  and then it slowly 
[02:50:30]  goes downhill  the rest of the day  yeah  I was feeling good  for a second  alright what do we got  to wrap up here  I have to plug  to me  oh Jimmy  Florida  I'm back on the road now  Florida  on the road again  yeah  West Palm Beach  July 10th through 12th  go to palmbeachimprov.com  for tickets  and then San Francisco  finally return to San Francisco  August 7 through 9  finally  Cobb goes on sale today  and then of course  Montreal  July 26th  at midnight  at the Gisu Theater  and there's other shows

[03:02:00]  weekend about  Indianapolis  and that's  that it's like  the south  of the Midwest  they're very  southern in a lot  of ways  it's amazing  though  because it's  pretty much  straight west  of Columbus  but they're like  and they were  laughing about it  so I'm not  insulting them  but they're a lot  more like  than the cities  around them  like you just  go a few miles  down the road  and all of a sudden  it's all about  racing and it's  all about guns  and a lot of  camo shorts  I saw  because it's  starting to be  summer there  so  yeah  there's a lot  of country music 
[03:02:30]  lovers there  it's like  Kentucky  like you'd  never think  that Kentucky  is right next  to Cincinnati  yeah  you know  like you think  of Cincinnati  you think of  like Cincinnati  WKRP  remember that show  with Lonnie Anderson  you think of  Cincinnati  it's like a city  and you think  of Kentucky  oh man  what's going  on down there  a lot of  banjo  picking and  moonshine  making  barbecue  and woohoo  you don't think  it's right next  to Cincinnati  the Cincinnati  airport's in  Kentucky  oh it is  yeah  you land 
[03:03:00]  in Kentucky  they call it  the Cincinnati  airport  because they're  ashamed  they're in  Kentucky  that's so sad  and I'm like  you know  Kentucky people  Kentucky's awesome  Louisville's awesome  you know  Kentucky fried chicken  alright  you guys are  known for bourbon  like you guys  make some great  shit  Kentucky's where  Corvettes are made  they make all  their Corvettes  in Kentucky  Jeremy Clarkson  the guy from  Top Gear  was driving  this Corvette  and he like  yelled out  like while I was  driving it  well done  fat man  from Kentucky  you have 
[03:03:30]  created a  masterpiece  I thought you were  going to say  he was going to  yell out the  n-word or something  no  he did that  later  he did that  that poor  bastard  people have  hubris man  they think they  can say things  like that  I read  I read something  cool about  Kentucky fried  chicken  since you brought  it up  I'm going to  say it  it's  the  colonel  like whoever  the actual  KFC guy  was  his  protege  or like  the person  who he trained  underneath him  his favorite  guy coming up  the ranks  of like  fast food  helped him 
[03:04:00]  out a lot  like made  some major  decisions  was the  guy that  told him  put the  chicken  in a  bucket  instead of  a box  this guy  was Dave  Thomas  who then  went on  to make  all the  Wendy's  whoa  powerful  fast food  conspiracy  theory  by Tony Hitchford  this is like  some shit  that your  friends told you  when you were  in high school  it turned out  to be totally  false  but you  repeated it  forever  Nabisco  is owned  by the  same people  who make  missiles  they're trying  to kill you 
[03:04:30]  one way  or another  bro  it's either  with cupcakes  or with  missiles  well  it is the  same company  that makes  cigarettes  Nabisco  is RJ  Reynolds  and RJR  Nabisco  RJR  is RJ  Reynolds  impossible  the people  feeding you  Twinkies  would not  hate you  and want  you dead  is that  Nabisco  were they  Twinkies  did Nabisco  have Twinkies  no  who had  Twinkies  Hostess  it's not the  same  but it could  be under  the same  I'm so dumb  it's painful  but Nabisco 
[03:05:00]  is known  as being like  you know  if you think  of like  snacks  right  you think  of like  something  that's yummy  but not  necessarily  good for you  I picture  the Nilla  wafers  remember those  yeah  what did  they have  that's like  real bullshit  Nabisco  Nabisco  they have  some good  chocolate chip  cookies  yeah  right  Nabisco  some good  chocolate chip  cookies  they got the  Keebler elves  on their side  I do believe  check this out  Dave Thomas  and Colonel  Sanders  both got  they both  won first place  they tied  for who split 
[03:05:30]  who could  best fry  chicken  wow  Dave Thomas  is chicken  why doesn't  Dave Thomas  just sell  I mean he's  dead now  but when he  was alive  why didn't  he sell  chicken at  Wendy's  he did  there was a  test market  well they do  sell chicken  at Wendy's  but there was  a test  like chicken  sandwiches  you can't get  like a bucket  of chicken  there was a  test market  company that  Wendy's started  that I only  think stayed  in Columbus  or at least  Ohio  called  Sisters Chicken  I don't know  if you think  that was  yeah I remember  that  and they  actually were  way better  than Kentucky  Fried Chicken  they had  these little  chicken littles  oh man  chicken littles  like a nugget 
[03:06:00]  it was  it was  like White  Castles  but with  chicken  oh shit  just little  baby chicken  it was like  the Steve  Jobs  a fest  well hey  he figured out  a lot of  shit with  Wendy's  yeah  like he  really did  like one  of the  things was  that the  food is  never  frozen  like if  you get  a steak  or a  hamburger  patty  steak  if you get  a hamburger  patty  from any  other place  it's usually  frozen  and they  just sort  of  like if  you look  at some  of them  they don't  even look  like meat  like White  Castle  it doesn't  even look  like meat  it's so  confusing  you're looking  at what  a White  Castle  burger  is  it's 
[03:06:30]  delicious  but you're  like what  the fuck  am I  eating  but if  you look  at Wendy's  like they  get their  patties  they're big  thick patties  and they  get them  and they  just  they don't  they don't  ever freeze  them  they just  throw them  right onto  the grill  which has  got to be  better  right  the less  you can  free shit  you gotta  think like  when you're  eating things  you're kind  of taking  in like  live cultures  like if  you eat  yogurt  you take  in live  bacteria  you know  and when  you eat  like anything  whether it's  whether it's  I mean 
[03:07:00]  any kind  of food  sort of  have like  some sort  of bacteria  fungus on  it just  a slight  amount  and so  when you're  taking them  in you're  taking in  like living  things  whenever you  just totally  freeze the  fuck out of  living things  it's never  good  you know  it just  can't be  good  there's  something  something's  gotta be  missing there  I don't  I mean  I'm no  scientist  but I  think when  you freeze  it till  it's  like  it literally  doesn't  rot  like  it's  not  supposed  to  happen  that's  supposed  to  be  fucked  you know  like  if you  have  crops 
[03:07:30]  and your  crops  freeze  you're  supposed  to  be  fucked  you know  that's  what  it's  supposed  to be  it's  not  supposed  to be  freeze  shit  and you're  eating  frozen  peas  like  what  is  even  in  those  things  that  shit  ain't  a  regular  pea  that's  gotta  cause  something  right  when  that  grow  woo  woo  factor  how I  would  describe  it  I would  say  you're  losing  the  essence  of the  life  form  of the  plant  freeze  it  kill  it  everything's  dead 
[03:08:00]  like  that's  the reason  why it's  not  rotting  is all  that  bacteria  that  would  normally  break  down  anything  that you  leave  out  and it  starts  to  decay  that's  all on  the  surface  of that  anyway  right  I mean  it just  takes time  to  rot  that's  what  it is  thaws  out  you have  some  live  cultures  is  all  about  like  everybody  wants  to  eat  probiotic  stuff  like  probiotic  I have  some  probiotic  sauerkraut  man  it was  amazing  what does 
[03:08:30]  probiotic  mean  it means  it's  rotting  like  probiotic  sauerkraut  it's  almost  like  carbonated  you ever  have  that  stuff  it's  fermented  oh  I've  had  it  yeah  it's  really  good  I love  it  it's  delicious  and super  good  for you  it's  like  a lot  of  people  don't  know  raw  sauerkraut  is  fucking  really  good  for  you  it's  got  a  live  thing  you're  taking  into  your  body  and  that  live  culture  is  very  good  for  fighting  off  diseases  and  for  balancing  your  stomach  and  there's  a lot  of  people  they're  connecting  it  with  autism  in  a lot 
[03:09:00]  of  ways  because  a lot  of  people  with  autism  also  have  bowel  issues  and gut  issues  and they  think  that  it  could  possibly  be  connected  to  a  wrong  fascinating  man  yeah  sauerkraut  is one  of the  few  things  that  is  good  for  you  and  completely  delicious  how crazy  is that  like it  makes a hot  dog  50%  better  easily  sausage  you could  put it  oh  Jesus  Tony  you're  making me  so hungry 
[03:09:30]  sauerkraut  is one  of those  foods  where you  can smell  it  and picture  it  with a  good  brown  seedy  mustard  oh  Jesus  whoever  figured  that out  like all  the other  vegetables  are supposed  to be  so jealous  they don't  get to be  on hot  dogs  you get  like pickles  you know  it's like  cucumbers  and sauerkraut  those are the  happy ones  yeah  lettuce and  tomatoes  are kind of  bullshit  on my  cheeseburger  oh yeah  totally  the fuck  is that  thing  all those  cool  vegetables  hate on  the lettuce  and tomatoes  why should  lettuce and  tomato  be allowed  to be  on a  cheeseburger  like let's  pretend  this is 
[03:10:00]  healthy  so true  lettuce is  less than  nothing  yeah  what's the  difference  between a  bratwurst  and a  sausage  that's a  good  question  maybe it's  a  it must be  the preparation  right  in ohio  bratwurst  were everywhere  like there  was restaurants  that specialized  in bratwurst  here i'm always  looking for a  bratwurst and i  can only find  sausages or hot  dogs  there's got to  be a place  i know you can  get them at  the store  i think bratwurst  might be a little  bit of a smokier  flavor that's my  guess going into  it i have no  idea let's talk  sausage  well we're 
[03:10:30]  talking  we're talking  ravens and  sausages  okay the same  difference is this  between a square  and a rectangle  what  you've just  broke  a bratwurst  a bratwurst  okay this is the  weirdest example  ever  the guy said a  square is a  rectangle but a  rectangle is not  a square  oh i see  um so is a  bratwurst a  sausage but any  sausage is not a  bratwurst  bratwurst are pork 
[03:11:00]  sausage with a  medium grind spiced  mainly with pepper  sausage is any  ground meat in  casing  so it seems like  it's a sausage  it's just a  different type of  sausage that's  all it is  i mean it's a  pork sausage  you can call it a  bratwurst all you  want that's a  creepy word too  it's german  what is that  yeah german  bratwurst  bring that  bratwurst over  here  what do you think  caused certain  parts of the world  to develop that  sound like that  like when you get 
[03:11:30]  like weird sounds  bratwurst  yeah  weird fucking  language sounds  those sounds that  people in that  region made like  what got them to do  that  you know what's  crazy is like  that's  they think the  opposite of us  like oh i'm an  american i  enunciate my  you know what i  mean like that's  what's crazy is we  look at them like  they're weird and  they look imagine how  weird we sound like if  you think of what they  sound like and what we  sound like their  perspective must be  like  it must sound like  we're like singing  things because it's so  pure  well we're a fascinating 
[03:12:00]  example for the rest of  the world because if you  look at all the other  english languages in the  world they all are  pretty similar australian  and new zealand i mean  they've got a good day  you know they got a  little bit of a difference  but it still sounds like  an english accent it's  like an altered english  accent whereas we got  over here and went  nah not so much  now we're gonna say it  our way fuck face  and we're gonna make  more bombs and we're  gonna make it how  everybody talks  your way's weird now  yeah you're gonna have  to learn our way  yeah the english language  is quite weird 
[03:12:30]  if you're somewhere  and you're talking to  a man he's still  talking like this  you're like sir i'm  having a hard time  understanding you right  now that's not english  this is english fucker  yeah hear that nice  and clean no fucking  word slurring into the  next word like word  soup you're on a  goddamn word food  train  we're perfect over here  in america we know  how to rock it we  fucking got took your  language and mincee'd  it we made it better  we mincee'd your 
[03:13:00]  language bitch  who's our shooter of  the day i haven't  heard yet today i don't  know i hope they  catch him fucker man  it's getting ugly dude  that north hollywood  shit was crazy so  that dude the north  hollywood thing for  folks who don't know  there was a man on a  roof and i i saw i  saw it from eliza  schlesinger's twitter  eliza schlesinger was  um torturing her uh  ex-boyfriend uh on uh  on twitter she dated a  guy schlesinger that  made up a complete total 
[03:13:30]  history he said his mom  was dying his mom was  fine there's nothing  wrong with his mom said  he went to the yale he  never went to yale he  said he was starting up  all these businesses the  guy was like a hundred  thousand dollars in debt  like he he was like living  with roommates like he was  just he totally fabricated  this super successful eliza  schlesinger got sarah tiana  she got sarah tiana  catfish catfight she got  sarah tiana hardcore but  she was going off on her  twitter and then i saw  something about shoot the  guy on the roof and i'm  like what guy on the roof  like you know she was 
[03:14:00]  saying kill that fucking  guy she's so crazy so and  then i went and i started  looking uh looking up  stories what exactly is the  the full well what pretty  much happened is it started  off as a police chase and  then it it went on like it  was one of those ones that  just went on every single  highway and the guy finally  got out out in uh north  hollywood and he's got out  of his car and when he he  was driving he was holding  out a big uh rifle a  automated rifle just like  hanging out the window and  so uh he pulls his car over 
[03:14:30]  in north hollywood and he  gets out of his car and he  pulls out this huge gun and  he just starts walking down  north hollywood with this  gun and then he gets on top  of a roof of a house and then  at that time that's when i  tuned in because i saw  eliza's tweet also and then  i thought he was just going  to shoot himself but he  just for about twenty  minutes he was on top of a  roof with a gun and then  he comes down off the roof  and he breaks into this  house luckily there was  nobody home and he just  sat in the house for about 
[03:15:00]  four hours that's when it  like the movie i mean the  the real life just completely  became boring like there's  so the news for like three  hours or whatever long it  was just repeating the same  thing over and over three  hours finally they got the  SWAT team all around the  house and they shot in a  bunch of containers uh of  smoke or whatever  tear gas and the guy just  walks out but what was the  coolest thing is that the  two police dogs just came  running up to him sniffed his  leg and then sat down right 
[03:15:30]  next to him like just like  hey we're waiting for a  whistle before we just chew  your dick apart you know and  the guy just like you know  surrendered so it was a really  crazy beginning part of the  movie or thing and then it  just sucked at the end well it  seems like four hours you know  the problem with we have a  short attention span we want  all live all these live  altercations to go down as if  they're a 90 minute movie that  we can pay attention to yeah i  mean just yesterday there was  somebody in vegas the i don't 
[03:16:00]  know if you saw the walmart  incident that happened in or the  day before in do you think this is  copycat shit i i think something's  going on man because this ice i  was talking about it four days  ago like how we've been having a  shooter every day there was a  guy in canada that i don't even  know if they ever caught in  canada the guy that was just had  like three guns and he was going  through neighborhoods shooting  cops and stuff yeah he was  shooting those guys who look like  bullwinkle's buddy yeah they  dress like bullwinkle's pal the  canadian royal mounties yeah they  it's a horrible story shot like 
[03:16:30]  three of them up there and someone i  met someone who knew that guy i  can't remember the exact thing but  they they uh weren't surprised it  seems like it is kind of like a  weird copycat thing now because i  mean we've been having it ever  since the santa barbara douchebag  well there's a lot of people out  there that are probably on the edge  and just takes one thing like that  to push them yeah the the the school  things with these that you know like  i saw part of that kids video where 
[03:17:00]  he's like i'm gonna eat them all and  it's like terrifying he was talking  like he was doing something much  bigger than shooting a few people  he was saying things like oh you're  all going to you know i'm gonna show  america or the world like he's  talking on such a grand scale and uh  i think that they really think that  it's even bigger than it is and that  they're like a hero or something like  they're going to be remembered for  that well they know that that's the  thing that people are most afraid of  so you can cause that thing to  happen you become famous i mean it's 
[03:17:30]  that simple and they they equate in  their head being famous in that way  is having an impact and you know  obviously the guy had a huge impact  with all the people's families that he  killed that guy just drove around he  killed his three roommates what was  fascinating was that that became um  this like uh woman's rights sort of  uh hashtag yes all women you know or uh  i wouldn't say i wouldn't say woman  rights like awareness awareness of uh  violence that women face and i gotta 
[03:18:00]  admit it makes you think about it in  a different way that that hashtag is a  great hashtag yes all women because not  all men have to worry about the things  that women have to worry about like  you don't have to worry about being  raped by chicks you don't have to worry  about you know like women beating you  up or women stealing things from you  or women trying to rape you you don't  have to worry about it but women have  to worry about it for men like it's a  whole different world they live in you  know it's it's hard to think about when  you live in your world you know your 
[03:18:30]  world's pretty easy you're super twink  you're right well yeah i was gonna say  i'm a i'm i'm about 130 pounds so i'm  pretty sure i can be raped at any given  point so i know a little the hashtag  should be yes all women and tony henshler  i know what it's like to be a woman do  you remember when uh someone said that  from the who pete townsend said that  so he knows what it's like to be a  woman oh because he's been a woman  really yeah it was some crazy claim  or some crazy statement about uh you  know having had bisexual experiences 
[03:19:00]  pete townsend's one of those guys like  if you do a little research he has some  crazy stuff about him but he can get  away with anything because he's the  lead guitarist from the who and he does  that windmill thing and you know when  you're that cool you could be crazy but  he has like some crazy history he got  investigated for child pornography yeah  and uh he said that he was doing it  for some sort of a research project or  something like that he was researching  child pornography so in doing so he's  searching for it yeah i don't remember  what the project was that he was  involved with that he was saying he was 
[03:19:30]  involved with but that's kind of  fucked there's one woman that could beat  up you were talking about there's no  like guys can get raped by women and  stuff like that did you see that woman  that beat up that little 17 year old  kid and he filmed the whole thing uh on  the connecticut beach there's chicks  like that out there he filmed it while  she was beating him up yeah there's this  woman in connecticut he was flying  one of those little toy drones on the  beach tonight and uh... it has little  cameras in it  and she thought she crazy woman like oh  he's recording us like it's illegal or  something to do that  and started like calling the police and 
[03:20:00]  he started filming it on his iphone what  she was doing  and right when she got off the phone with  the police she's like you better get  here i got him right now  because i thought it just starts beating  this kid up and he's filming the whole  thing like that after i saw this video i  actually had to go in the other room and  just sit down so my heart was racing so  hard i just want to kill somebody after  watching you should would you like to  look at it it's really you're fucking  i'm not mad at this moment lip like  i want to find this woman i want to  find this woman this is going to drive  you crazy okay let's see it okay check 
[03:20:30]  this is making me mad you had to go sit  in another room your heart was beating  and okay buddy just breathe  in jimmy's twenty food did not  appreciate this man flying his drone on  the beach  she was under the impression she had  your property  this guy is taking pictures and trying  to upload them from a from a camera can  you guys get here at ham and acid at  middle beach  i'm not realizing there's video recording  her  he's taking pictures of people on the 
[03:21:00]  beach with a helicopter plane  the cop wow  yeah can you guys hurry  the video kept him from getting arrested  because she said that he had assaulted her  i already talked to him just come  they released him after they showed the  video from the iphone  yeah stop stop stop stop  i'm not a little bit  it's so fucked up  get some people here  right now all you're seeing is this kid  holding on to his equipment the woman is  uh he's trying to put his equipment away  you're assaulting me you ass wife 
[03:21:30]  yeah i think this is fake no it's not  the woman was arrested  this is on the news what is this guy doing  that's a weird half guard  yeah you want to take pictures  look at that her hands are ripping in there  his mouth  yeah she's putting her hands in his mouth 
[03:22:00]  and he's filming it the entire time  like as a selfie  smart  it's hilarious actually  yeah you can see how it feels  oh my god this girl's crazy  she had a terrible half of her  now what told me  if you weren't assaulting me i wouldn't be touching you  well maybe you shouldn't be taking pictures of people  on the beach  you want to stop assaulting me  get off of me  i'm going to beat your ass you little mother  can someone call the cops  i'm being assaulting 
[03:22:30]  help  wow  he's just totally playing her  he's not really scared  he's just happy that he's filming all this  yeah  please get off of me  that video makes me crazy  this is photography is not a crime  yeah  it's amazing that he got that  why does that make you so mad  to me it's funny 
[03:23:00]  because i've been in situations  with psych  yeah  what's funny is he wasn't in danger  he was doing this the whole time  he wasn't like  he was like making sure he filmed  this girl beating the shit out of him  right  like he didn't even like stop her  defend himself  he wasn't scared  i've been in domestic violence  play things before though  and that shit where  she could have just said  yeah he attacked me  and stuff like that  she did  she did say that  that's why he  i know that whole situation  drives me nuts  like to the fact where it makes me want to have a gopro on me  recording all day 
[03:23:30]  yeah  no yeah  you get assaulted by chicks all day long  imagine we got  brian's upload  and all day  be like chicks punching him  holding him down the parking lot  and fucking kicking him in the balls  you just assaulted me  and he just wasn't telling us about these  get over me  he was just keeping all these from us  because he didn't want us talking about it on the show  it's like you know every day  another one  i'm gonna bring it up  no fuck it  they're gonna make fun of me  all day is just chicks beating his ass  yeah i don't know man 
[03:24:00]  i mean she's obviously an asshole  but he was like letting her get away with it on purpose  it is amazing  it is amazing  five ten years ago  that same thing happens  that 17 year old  who was just flying his plane on a beach  ends up going to jail  because if a woman does say  this guy assaulted me  yeah  and the cops come there  and they see his shirt half ripped  as if she was in a defensive position  you know what i mean  absolutely  it's amazing  yeah  there's no doubt 
[03:24:30]  there's no doubt  well she said that he was assaulted  or that he assaulted her rather  they showed the video  and that's what got him off  so i think that  she's obviously a crazy person  and would lie  but i think that's normal  for people that beat your ass  like people that beat your ass  like that  like physically beat your ass  they're fucking crazy  they're crazy  of course they're gonna lie  they're not telling the truth  they're fucked up  oh yeah  they're a mess  like that's gotta be  the hardest thing about being a cop  is like you're showing up  and two people are beating the fuck out of each other  you gotta figure out who did what  and you always gotta side with the woman 
[03:25:00]  yeah  you just gotta  O.J. Simpson  law  is what they nicknamed  and the reason why you gotta side with the woman  is cause like  let's reverse that scenario  if that guy had been beating that girl up  it wouldn't be funny at all  right  but it was funny to me  watching that guy  you're assaulting me  will you stop assaulting me  while he's self-eating himself  come on  I think that's funny  I would not think it's funny  if it was a man doing it to a woman  because I would worry  the woman's gonna really get hurt  I wasn't worried about him getting hurt there  right  I mean she wasn't even strong enough to hurt him  you never know man  he was only 17  and she was a grown adult 
[03:25:30]  he was self-eating himself  the whole time  she could probably have raped him  if she wanted to  no  I think that kid is smart  that he didn't fight back  he's very smart  that all he did was defend himself  very smart  he's a smart kid obviously  you can't just go around doing that  like yeah  you probably shouldn't  fucking fly your drone  into people's houses  and film them  you shouldn't hover over their backyard  where they're trying to suntan  and film them  I don't know what he was doing  it's a weird thing  this idea  that you could put a camera  on top of a little robot 
[03:26:00]  and fly it around  because  when we were filming that sci-fi show  we had some dudes  that were really good at it  they had like these high-tech drones  and we were fucking around with them  and putting on these goggles  and the virtual reality goggles  you put them on  and you feel like you're flying  like this drone  you're going over the treetops  and I was like  this is gonna get real weird  because this isn't  super expensive stuff  like you're looking at this  this is like  I mean  a couple thousand bucks  or something like that  to get a rig like this  I don't know how many thousand  I'm just guessing  but it didn't look to be  like prohibitively expensive  it's not like something 
[03:26:30]  that costs 50 grand  or something like that  I think you could get it  for the price of like  some toys that people  save up and buy  like there's a lot of people  that could have  a fucking flying robot  that films everything  no they have it at Fry's  for like 30 bucks  like they  30 bucks  are really cheap  you know technology's crazy  when that's like  in the eye  on the checkout area  on your way out  they'll grab a drone  I don't think it's  the same level  of sophistication  that these guys have  these guys had  like I said  virtual reality  cameras attached to them  and they're pretty sophisticated 
[03:27:00]  but they have a real problem  with how long  they can stay up in the air  they can't stay up  in the air very long  they just  they just can't do it  they just run out of gas  and they fall  you can load them up  with batteries  but then that battery  is weight  and it makes it harder  for them to fly  so they  they need to work around that  I think they can only stay up  for like 30 minutes  or something like that  I mean maybe there's some  that could do it better  but when you're watching one  fly over the treetops  and you're wearing  one of those goggles  it's a trip dude  it's a freaky feeling  you're like  wow this is nuts  this is like 
[03:27:30]  what it's like  to be an eagle  you know  if they get that shit  really really good  it's gonna be nuts  if they can develop  some super clear  like get something  that wraps around your head  right like this  like your entire field of vision  out like this  is all this  you know  this screen  and then figure out  some way  to film something  and not have it  make any noise  so you don't hear  somehow or another  they can make something  that doesn't make noise  yeah these drones 
[03:28:00]  there's a really cool  music video  or not music video  but just video  of a guy throwing  doing a drone  over Los Angeles  and he goes like  on top of the  Capitol Records building  you can see like  the roof  and stuff like that  he goes over  like the Hollywood Hills  parties  like that house  that's above  the comedy store  and there's people  having a party up there  and he's just going  right over  people with beach balls  there's Jim Henson's  studios  he just flew over  yeah see that's  kind of weird  that's kind of weird  especially like say  if you have like  an ex-boyfriend  or an ex-girlfriend  and they decide  to fucking fly a drone  around your house 
[03:28:30]  and film you  while you're fucking  the next person  you know  get mad at you  you fucking piece of shit  you didn't even  wait a month  you didn't even  wait a month  we were almost married  you've got that  whore in your bed  I wasn't expecting  you to be watching  me with your drone  my drone  just introduced me  to the truth  you're a piece of shit  you're fucking deflecting  when I bought you  that drone  I didn't think  you were going  to be spying on me  I thought you'd trust me  like the arguments  of the future 
[03:29:00]  do you think  this has to be used  by like perverts  and paparazzis nowadays  like just going up  in hotels  with little cameras  and your own drones  because look at this  this is like HD  look at this party  that's on top  of this hotel  look at these people  are just having a party  on this hotel  and it's drones  flying over  people start noticing  the drones  and start throwing  like beach balls  at it and stuff  they made it  in certain places  where it's legal  to shoot them  in Colorado  there was a town  in Colorado  that passed  some sort of a resolution 
[03:29:30]  that would allow you  to shoot at drones  wow  that's so funny  yeah  it's going to be  like a video game  we're going to be  like shooting drones  every day  I know  oh here's the comedy story  look  going above the comedy story  they've been there  this Colorado town  apparently they're  just considering it  they haven't done it  totally  as of March 31st  but it's Deer Trail  Colorado  and  there's 563 people 
[03:30:00]  in the town  that are worried  about drones  you should be worried  about getting up  to 600 people  your fucking town  is tiny as shit  your town isn't  even a small theater  that's ridiculous  how do you guys  have your own laws  that seems preposterous  that a town that little  like you're driving through  and the law changes  and then you go  to the other side  the law's different  get the fuck out of here  the law's different  and you got 563 people  that's a cult  that's a cult  you got a cult  you do not have a town  you fucking weirdos  they probably just made it  legal for witches 
[03:30:30]  to even exist  and they're like  alright we'll allow  witchcraft for now  but those drones  are the devil  robot witches  you can't have  robot witches  get those flying  robot witches  out of here  on their flying  robot broomstick  well there's these  two towns in Colorado  one is Greeley  and one is  right next to it  god I can't remember  the name of the one  next to it  Deer Valley  or some shit  whatever it is  the one next to it  embraced weed  like in a big way  where they've just got 
[03:31:00]  fucking dispensaries  opening up everywhere  and giant warehouses  and right next to it  there's Greeley Colorado  and they had this CNBC show  and it was hilarious  because they had this guy  who's like the sheriff  of Greeley  who wouldn't allow it  and he was like  you know  there's been a lot  of things associated  with marijuana now  like we're noticing  long term  psychiatric issues  that are happening  and you listen to this guy  talking  he's like some  old fucking cowboy  right  some crazy old cowboy  who doesn't realize  the war is over  yeah 
[03:31:30]  the fucking  the guy's like  standing  well you don't  know  psychiatric issues  what about booze  you fuck  what about cigarettes  and the beatings  you took  in the boxing gym  should all that  be illegal  you fucking  crazy asshole  look at these people  they're having a blast  right next door  go over to that place  go check out  what they're doing  they're fucking  dancing the street  and hugging each other  everybody's high as fuck  they're making millions  they're making millions  and you're like  well you've been known  psychological issues  due to marijuana 
[03:32:00]  there's no psychological issues  due to fucking  playing cards  okay  people are nuts  we're not perfect  the idea that weed  is the one  what's fucking  sending these  psychological issues  people over the top  how dare you  how dare you  make that association  especially since  you know  stress is such a huge factor  shoot there's a lot of shit  it has to be  the number one  cause of psychological issues  stress  not to mention physical  people don't really realize  the reason why hearts give out 
[03:32:30]  is because of stress  that's all the years of stress  I mean yeah you get old  but it's still stress  stress is on the heart  and stress is stress  so it's so funny  that that's a stance  like marijuana  causing psychological issues  when  well the problem  Tony Hinchcliffe  with your kind of thinking  is we have data  to back up our assertions  it shows a clear change  in the human brain  areas of development  the area that accepts  bullshit shrinks  okay we need that  plump and fat  that area  is not like  fog wall 
[03:33:00]  we need it like  like a filled sponge  that's we need that  the area that allows  bullshit  and the marijuana  is shrinking  this area  that allows you  to tolerate bullshit  and I don't like it  I don't  I do not like it  we need people out there  that can  suck in our bullshit  it's like a bullshit liver  that's what it is  you have a bullshit liver  you have a liver for booze  you also have a bullshit liver  in your brain  and marijuana apparently  makes that thing shrink  that's what I heard  wow  they try everything  they try everything 
[03:33:30]  to scare marijuana smokers  why  why is that  they should just smoke weed  and get their dick sucked  they would change the way  they feel about all this  they'd be like  I can't believe blowjobs  feel so good  do do do do  do do do  do do do  it's from someone  who loves you  who tickles your balls  when you come in their mouth  hey  while you're high  Jesus  Louisa  okay they don't know about that  do they know about that  because if they do  you know I would imagine  if you're a girl  there's no way the sheriff  at Greenlee knows about that  if you're a girl  and you smoke a couple 
[03:34:00]  hits of weed  and then get your pussy licked  that's gotta feel so good  could you imagine  like a shower feels good  when you're high  can you imagine  how good it feels for a girl  do you have your ass licked  do I like my ass licked  listen  you and I  are never gonna have  this conversation  just let you know  right now  it ends here  it ends here with you  I'm not opening those doors  Jesus  what kind of a man  asks another man  this is like a fill out form 
[03:34:30]  for a fucking gang bang video  okay  now  do you like it in your ass licked  because if yes  check the box to the right  that should never come up  you should go from your cradle  to the grave  without anybody ever asking you  do you like it in your ass licked  right  or maybe  maybe that should be  that should be a fun thing  about a funeral  is you have to write the answer  yes or no  like on a piece of paper  and then have it in your hand  like when you're dead  like in the open casket  yes I loved it  I secretly loved it  did you check his note  yeah it was a yes  with two exclamation points 
[03:35:00]  he really liked it  see the problem with the question  like do you like your ass licked  is that's not how anybody ever asks it  if they're gonna lick your ass  right  they don't go  do you like to get your ass licked  they don't say that  they would say  do you want me to lick your ass  huh  you do huh  they would have a lot of  huh's in there  like want me to lick your ass  huh  you do huh  like they're already affirming it  because it's a risky thing to say  yeah  like you want me to lick your ass  huh  let me try it again Jeff  there's an affirmation in it  you know  it's like you want 
[03:35:30]  you want that person  to have an easy time saying yes  you know  no it's like  yeah because someone says  you want me to lick your ass  and you go  well that would be cool  you  you fucking sick fuck  fuck you  I tricked you  asshole  right  right the bedroom opens up  the camera crew comes in  you've been on  you've been on the new show  do you want your ass licked  and then it becomes like a big court case  where they try to figure out  what  what huh means  when you add huh to it  and the lawyer tries to defend it  clearly  if she used the word huh  she was 
[03:36:00]  she was trying to get a positive affirmation out of him  she was manipulating his emotional responses  the natural responses of a person  he was doing it to be polite  he didn't really want his ass licked  okay  he didn't want her to feel bad  she said huh already  he's like yeah okay  what  as it was happening  he was realizing he had made a mistake  yeah  you know  he'd be like joining an army  that thinks they're gonna go out and fight Bigfoot  like you got all your fucking gear  and you ready to go to the mountains  like  we are  the Sasquatch  and then he'd be like 
[03:36:30]  oh what have I done  what have I done  I can't believe  I'm gonna go  there's an army of people  I've joined  fuck I made a mistake  shit  yeah  but you can't pull out of it  that's what it's gotta be like  it's crazy  poor guy  Greeley, Colorado  you poor bastard  right next door  I forget what the other city's name  is that the same place  that shoots down the drones  or is that a different place  no  different place  but the other place  the name  those people were so high 
[03:37:00]  that I forgot their name  that's how high they were  like the mayor of the town  was joking around about it  they had the mayor of the town  in this interview  start joking around about it  this town's always been like that  like Greeley was a drive town  back in the day  you couldn't get booze  we don't want no booze  because what we see  when we have booze  is less attendance in the church  that's a bunch of crazy people  that's what that is  lot of hooting and hollering  the reason why they're afraid  of booze and pot  if they're that afraid of it  is because they're afraid  what they'll do  if they have a drink  or a smoke  they're afraid that inner monster 
[03:37:30]  whatever their fears  and whatever crazy stuff's going on  that's what that is  well no no no  Tony Hinchcliffe  I'm worried about your inner monster  because my inner monster  is safe under the guidance of the Lord  see you're a heathen out there  running around with your own ideas  and I got children  okay Tony Hinchcliffe  well Sheriff  I have bad news for you  you're going and praying  to an imaginary creature  once or twice a week  hey you fucking communist  lesbian asshole  listen  you can't say that  it's imaginary  you don't know  you son of a bitch 
[03:38:00]  I go to church  I feel the Holy Spirit  inside me all the time  I move to tongues  you ever move to tongues  Tony Hinchcliffe  but then your priest  he drinks wine  I mean Jesus turned water  into wine  but you don't want anybody  to drink  I am not a catholic sir  I'm a baptist  baptist  we don't fuck around with wine  you can't have wine  in the church  is that true  they don't drink wine  I don't believe so  I think the wine  is a catholic thing  let's find out  this is a google day  do baptist use wine  I know the catholics  love wine  they try any excuse 
[03:38:30]  like hey can we get  the  well you know  what's really funny  Mormons are not  supposed to drink coffee  but they can drink  those energy drinks  so I do a dude  who was a Mormon  who used to pound  those fucking  giant monster energy drinks  and the dude  would have panic attacks  all the time  he was just  jacked to the teeth  all day  just  just redlining  it all day  what is this feeling  that this gives me  he has no idea  because never having coffee 
[03:39:00]  can relate to it  he wouldn't drink the coffee  but yet he's pounding  these drinks  like is it an evil being  there is an evil being  out there  and it's corrupting  the souls  of our mortal youth  Red Bull gives me wings  just like the angels  of Mormon  exactly  of the Mormon religion  I drink a monster  energy drink  to be a monster  against Satan's urges  I monstrously attack you  Satan  nothing funnier  than Mormonism  no there is  you know that  they think that  when you die  you get your own planet 
[03:39:30]  you know that right  um how do you know  you don't  Tony Hinchcliffe  okay  why so judgmental  Tony Hinchcliffe  and that everybody  lives on their own  different planet  that'd be dope  well yeah it'd be dope  but that's how you know  it's a made up story  but it's only dope  it's only dope  if we could visit each other  like it would suck  if like you were on the moon  and I was on Mars  but I couldn't get to you  I'd be like  Tony where are you  but I'm sure in this world  like the traveling  is like just so fast  yeah it's probably  pretty quick  if you can get to a place  where you have your own planet 
[03:40:00]  I assume you just be  wherever you want  whenever you want to be there  like instantaneous  right  that'll happen  one day we'll figure that out  we'll figure out  how to transport ourselves  I think if human beings  live for another  million years  if we live to  I mean  we're supposedly  like this close  to  like this  this frame  that we're in right now  the homo sapien  the way we look  it's supposedly  pretty similar  to what  a million years ago  looked like  like a million years ago  there was some  ape-like man 
[03:40:30]  that kind of stood up  but fairly similar  you know  and then maybe  in this form  you know  a few hundred thousand years  three or four hundred thousand years  like there's a lot of guesswork  involved  in figuring it out  but if we could keep going  another million  we would be hairless  for sure  we'd lose our hair  we would probably  be really slight  and very Tony Hinchcliffe-like  like a dancer's physique  an alien dancer  and our heads would grow  we would look like  fucking aliens  and then  when we hit that point  if we continue  if we don't blow each other up 
[03:41:00]  if we continue  and we don't get hit by an asteroid  we continue to improve  our ability to do things  it'll be nuts  a million years from now  you probably will be able  to transport  or teleport  anywhere you want  anywhere in the world  I'll one up you  I'll bet a hundred thousand years  Jesus Christ  Tony Hinchcliffe  at this rate  that we're growing  with technology  I think we're  even closer  I would almost say  ten thousand years  that's away from  if you think about  ten thousand years ago  that sounds really dumb  but if 
[03:41:30]  ten thousand years ago  doesn't seem like that long ago  but that's a really long time  oh yeah  like ten thousand years ago  we find these like  stone buildings  that they made  a bunch of really cool shit  that they left behind  but  not much else  ten thousand years ago  I don't even think  people are on boats  they didn't even figure that out yet  no they did  they're finding out  that people figured out  a lot of shit  a lot earlier than we thought  in fact  forty thousand years ago  they were hunting  they were fishing for tuna  in boats  which I'm pretty sure 
[03:42:00]  that was the number  that they came up with  because they found  these deep sea rigs  you know  where they use these long lines  and these big hooks  and they were catching tuna  they found tuna DNA  which is really crazy  like tuna  are a deep water fish  so these fuckers  let me find out  what year it was  they figured out  let me see  what did I google there  ancient people  fish for tuna  are you sitting on a yoga ball now?  no  what is that chair?  that's interesting  you're like  fuck back support  who needs it?  no this is  this is the best 
[03:42:30]  back support  for me at least  it forces you to sit straight  like see how I'm sitting  this is how you're supposed to sit  you're supposed to sit  like this  like your head's not supposed to be forward  and when you  most times you sit in a chair  you wind up slumping  sitting like that  and then it makes your back really tight  since I've been using this  my back never fucks with me  when we do podcasts  that's awesome  yeah  you just  you sit on it  and your knees are in it  I don't know what they're called  like a knee chair  or something like that  but you just  you're carrying your own weight 
[03:43:00]  and then  once you do it for a while  if you get used to it  then you start doing it everywhere  like I do it on planes  I do it  you should sit up straight  like all the time  and when you don't  when you have bad posture  I used to think that people said  oh you should  you know watch your posture  because it like  they didn't want you looking lazy  but it's actually not good for your discs  like your shit gets compressed  that's why when dudes have a fat wallet  they say never keep a fat wallet  in your back pocket  if you're one of those guys  that keeps every god damn business card  that you ever get  what was that  poking  Toys R Us 
[03:43:30]  ten dollars  oh fool  you get these  big fat crazy thick wallets  if you sit on that shit all the time  you can get disc problems  like a lot of cab drivers  get sciatic nerve problems  because they get a pinched disc  because your body's just got  an uneven distribution of weight  and that's what it is  kind of when you're slumped  or you're sitting weird  you know  it's an uneven distribution of weight  I have that  a hundred percent  anytime I go on a road trip now  after like two hours  my right side  starts getting numb  and I start  I mean I start  having like little  do you sit on your wallet  no I don't  but it's like how I sit 
[03:44:00]  and also  I'm a sluncher  I'm a turtle  yeah you shouldn't do that man  I used to think that it was just  that like slouching  I had a real problem slouching  I slouch all the time  and I just  I think  I thought it was just  like the way it looks  is not good  like people don't like  the way it looks  so my attitude was  slouching  that's so stupid  but it's just not  when your back is straight  like this  like this is the way  you're supposed to stand  your spinal column  your core  is carrying your weight  very evenly 
[03:44:30]  it's all stacked up  but when your head  goes forward  and you sort of relax  you put a great deal  of pressure  on other parts  you put like  there's like a peak area  of your spine  that has additional pressure  and it seems like nothing  and it is nothing  for a long time  and then it becomes something  and if you sit like  I used to get real bad  back and neck pains  from writing  and I think I might have  fucked myself up  doing that  as much as I fucked myself up  from doing jiu jitsu  because I would write  for a long period of time  and I would sit in a chair 
[03:45:00]  like this  with my head forward  and then when I was all done  I'd be like  ugh  my neck would be  fucking killing me  I just don't like  sitting like this  because I feel like  I'm like posing  like a woman  and I'm very curt  like pointing my butt  and boobs out  I feel like I have to  look back at it  like I hate it  or something  so you're afraid  of it the way it looks  you'd rather just have  a backache  right  you know  a backache  is just easier  to deal with  yeah but seriously  it does look really silly  for me to sit like  hey  because I mean  my butt's sticking out  my boobs's sticking out  like I feel like a  well you need to reduce  both of those things 
[03:45:30]  they won't stick out as much  that would help tremendously  and uh  believe me  right  just  let the boobs out  that's Brian Redman  logic  total  101  right  totally  I don't want to lose  my boobs  and my butt  you know  I've been working on this  so  he lost a lot of weight  and got real slim  he's like  makes my head look too big  fuck this  yeah  he looks like a freak  that's his fucking  he like  spent all this work  to get down  to like 160 something pounds 
[03:46:00]  he was like super skinny  yeah I have a picture  of me and you together  and I look like a  fucking lego boy  you don't look like  a lego boy dude  you just  you look healthy  I look like I had AIDS  remember  everyone called me AIDS  well it's because  you did it so quick  you did it  not everyone  you're at the post office  I can drop off  some packages  okay AIDS face  aren't you AIDS face  yeah  Starbucks  you know  venti  mocha latte  AIDS face 
[03:46:30]  AIDS face  they write it  on your cup  it didn't look like  you had AIDS dude  what it looked like  to me was a guy  who lost weight  he looked healthy  that's when we  met Seth Rogen  that's right  yeah we did the  High Times Music Awards  what is it  High Times Awards  I presented him  with Stoner of the Year  and there was  Jack Harar  yeah Jack Harar  he was alive back then  those things are interesting  those fucking  High Times Awards  you meet all  the fellow stoners  maybe the nicest  people on the planet  like celebrity stoners  like be real 
[03:47:00]  is there a nicer person  to be real  that guy's one of the  nicest people on the planet  and all those celebrity  stoners  they're all like super cool  Doug Benson  sweetheart  you know  all the celebrity  stoners  just super nice people  why anybody would want  to stop a drug like that  well you know  I'll tell you  the problem with that  well you're not  taken into account  as a lack of ambition  these stoners  they take up  you know  a lot of room  and they don't do anything  they don't earn  they keep  but Sheriff  what about all the 
[03:47:30]  artists and the musicians  that have come from  pot  that smoke pot  you mean queers  like Steve Jobs  is that what you're  trying to say  yeah Jesus took him  from us  let me tell you  something  Jesus is not impressed  you didn't  you know it looked like  AIDS face there  fella  you look good  it looked like  no  you're just not used to it  because you're used  to this backup  you're used to all the  support  you got your head  then you got some backup  when your body shrinks up  you felt like you didn't  have any backup  your head just didn't  seem like it was  aww Brian 
[03:48:00]  look at you  look how sweet you look  dude you don't look bad  there at all  you look great  you might have some  butt sex  you know I've told you  before  why does everything  that's skinny with you  mean gay  that's so weird  no I just  this has got issues  no I just look like  I had AIDS  you don't look like  you have AIDS  right HIV  you don't even look  like you have HIV  you look like  you have diarrhea  maybe  like a little bit  like you got that face  like  it's adorable Brian  come on look at that  picture  you don't look bad at all  it's a dude from Weeds  but look at your face  you do not look bad at all  I can't 
[03:48:30]  I can't watch Weeds  I watched one episode  and um  uh  who the fuck was on it  one of our  our friends was on it  oh uh  who was on it  Kevin Nealon  no it's uh  Brett Ernst  Brett Ernst was on it  yes right  what did he play  like a drug dealer  he played drug dealer  yeah  I watched it  cause Brett was on it  that's it  I watched it  one other time  and I was like  this is fake  this is not real  I'm not buying this  you know what's fake  is that catfish show  I heard so many people  say how awesome that show is  I finally watch it  the fakest show I've ever seen 
[03:49:00]  duh  I didn't know it was fake  duh  you know I heard on reality TV  sometimes  they like plan that shit out  like it's not really reality  did you hear that Tony?  well it almost seems like  it would benefit them  with so much money  spending money on the production  oh wait a minute  conspiracy theorists  so you think  that what they would do  just to make money  they would be willing  to fake it  and risk their reputations  that's a reality show  when I tune into a reality show  I want reality  you know that  and I know that  right 
[03:49:30]  that's a weird one to fake though  you know  that it's just  faking people  it's the best one to fake  why wouldn't you fake that one  they can really  figure out how easy it is  like what they're doing  like people just looking  at a camera  like I thought for sure  that he was  you know  the man that I thought  dude people will do  whatever the fuck  you ask them to do  if you have a camera  in front of you  I mean there's a certain  amount of people  that will do it  so if you have  some sort of reality show  and you just manipulate  these people  and say hey  you know I want you  this is what you're going to do  you're going to tell us 
[03:50:00]  you know that you've been  texting this guy  and pretending to be a girl  and then you're going to  meet him here  and say I busted you  dude  and now I know  what's up  and the guy's like  okay okay okay  how long have I known him  you've been friends  for 20 years  okay okay okay  we've been friends  for 20 years man  and they'll say shit like that  man we've been friends  for 20 years  I thought I trusted you  of course they're going  to fake that shit  it's like all that  Maury Povich and stuff  like that shows  still when I'm on the road  and I'm flipping through channels  I'll stop for a few minutes  and I'll watch Maury  I'll watch the results 
[03:50:30]  because no matter what  no matter what happens  one of them's going to get up  and go  oh I told you  I told you  that that was  or wasn't my baby  like whichever one  one of them's going to flip out  because they  you know  it's just so coached  well one of the guys  who was a doorman  at um  uh  not Eastside Comedy Club  Governors  Governors in Levittown  in Long Island  one of the doorman  one of the doorman  was a regular  on those shows  back in the day  like  this was a 19  I want to say  1990 
[03:51:00]  1991  pre-internet  and he used to get a call  and they would say  we're looking for a man  who has been having sex  with his brother's wife  and he goes  what a coincidence  I've been having sex  with my brother's wife  what do you want me to do  and they would  literally say that to him  see if you can help us out here  that was the conversation  they would have  what we're trying to find  is a guy  who got arrested  wearing women's clothes  and trying to get a job  in a woman's office  and they go  oh what a coincidence  you know  they'll tell him  the exact scenario  that he wants 
[03:51:30]  so all those people  are just  they're just good at it  like you'll see that  Mike Ricca did it  Mike Ricca did it  way back in the day  Mike Ricca who was a comic  at the comedy store  in the 1990s  he did that shit for money  I met Mike  yeah Mike was a funny dude  man  Mike was a funny dude  you know  I don't know if he's still  doing stand-up anymore  but back in the day  when we started out  together at the store  in the 90s  he was fucking funny man  there's a lot of those guys  that for whatever reason  you know  people don't find out  about them  yeah he's one of those guys  that was there  the first few months 
[03:52:00]  when I started  and we like made friends  and then I watched him  basically quit  yeah  I mean I  I think he moved  somewhere else  but I  you know  I watched him fade out  of the store  yeah  but anyway  he used to do that shit  this has been  the Joe Rogan experience  expand further  into the Rogan universe  at JoeRogan.net  and listen every Saturday  at 11 a.m.  and 11 p.m.  Eastern  here on the  Open and Happy Day channel  Hi I'm Pete Dominick
