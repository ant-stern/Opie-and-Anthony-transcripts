<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with Opie struggling with a malfunctioning microphone, resorting to a hammer for a (presumably unsuccessful) repair.  Anthony then boasted about his surprisingly accurate prediction of the previous day's stock market downturn, sparking a discussion about the economic crisis, featuring angry commentary on the AIG bailout and CEO compensation, including a suggestion to behead some of them.  Studio guest Robert Kelly was celebrating his "birthday week," though a planned surprise breakfast failed due to a staff member sleeping in.  The conversation segued into bachelor parties, contrasting modern, tame activities with traditional, often debaucherous ones involving strippers.  Numerous callers shared explicit anecdotes about their bachelor party experiences, detailing mishaps, unsanitary situations, intoxication, questionable decisions, and encounters with strippers, including discussions of potential STDs.  The show also covered a recent staff paintball outing, detailing injuries, strategies, and the hosts' participation.  More explicit caller stories about bachelor parties followed, including one about a stripper injuring herself and another about a police raid at a party involving strippers and drugs.  A woman's bachelor party website was discussed, comparing the relative debauchery of men's and women's parties.  The presidential debate was briefly criticized as boring, with commentary on the candidates' performances and the political climate.  Finally, the hosts reminisced about past stunts involving bodily functions and objects, referencing specific past segments like the "egg-throwing woman" and "cigarette-smoking" stunts.

A significant portion of the show focused on a comedic critique of the second 2008 presidential debate. The hosts mocked Tom Brokaw's pronunciation struggles and his inability to control the candidates, making jokes about McCain's age and appearance and Michelle Obama's physique.  They also commented on the debate's content, particularly the economy and McCain's perceived dismissal of some audience members, especially African Americans.  The overall tone and lack of in-depth discussion of other issues were also criticized.  The discussion shifted to Jim Norton (with Robert Kelly filling in) and Patrice O'Neal's comedic styles.  A "PTG" (Primetime Gossip) segment addressed Opie's controversial statement about Patrice O'Neal, followed by a "Jocktober" segment reviewing the Cincinnati radio show "Married with Microphones." The hosts also briefly discussed plans to franchise the Opie and Anthony show.  The segment was filled with vulgar language and offensive jokes.

The "Married with Microphones" segment analyzed the show's seemingly mundane content, speculating on the hosts' off-air interactions.  A proposed spin-off, "Divorced with Microphones," featuring a feuding couple, was discussed, with caller suggestions.  One caller detailed his impending divorce.  Technical difficulties, including a malfunctioning microphone (requiring a hammer, as mentioned earlier, and Greg Hughes also receiving a hammer for similar issues), and the deteriorating studio were discussed.  The hosts analyzed radio filler techniques, including a long, absurd joke from "Clean Janine's Joke of the Day."  Obama's Nashville appearance and the visual distortion caused by striped ties were briefly mentioned. The segment ended with a bizarre, suggestive "Happy Birthday" rendition by Sam for a caller, Bob Kelly, eliciting varied listener reactions.

A phone call with comedian Gallagher provided comedic stock market commentary, with Gallagher claiming his presence affected stock prices.  He made pronouncements on various companies (Solar, LDK, Colgate Palmolive, Russian phone companies, Disney, Chesapeake Oil, Monsanto, etc.), interspersed with off-color jokes. The hosts tracked the Dow's fluctuations based on Gallagher's pronouncements. Robert Kelly remained in studio.  Later, a failed attempt to connect with a deaf caller via relay service resulted in vulgar exchanges with the operator, leading to the call being terminated by a supervisor.  The hosts discussed the incident and played a bit with Ann Curry's stand-up comedy attempt, continuing with off-color jokes about sex and bodily functions.  More listener calls and discussions followed.

A caller's repeated use of obscene language, particularly focusing on "cock" and other sexually explicit terms, dominated a segment. Opie, Anthony, and guest Bobby reacted to and engaged with the caller's graphic descriptions.  Bobby contributed sexually suggestive statements.  The segment included discussions about Bobby's upcoming appearance at Bananas comedy club and sponsor mentions (WebEx).  A "line of the day" segment featured sexually suggestive lines.  Birthday wishes for Bobby were followed by him revealing his phone number on-air, leading to chaotic commentary and the show's abrupt end, with joking banter about Bobby's performance and ranking among regular contributors.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  My mic work?  Yeah, works today.  That's good.  They've given me a hammer.  Really?  Yeah, just in case it doesn't work.  I'm, you know, to tap it.  Yeah. 
[00:00:30]  That's what it's come down to?  Yeah.  I feel like when I was, I don't know, I had my first pickup truck and the starter motor was broke.  Sure.  Every so often I had to roll underneath and I kept a hammer with me.  You know, you got to bang that thing to loosen up that solenoid a little bit.  I'm right back there again with my microphone.  Tap it.  I got to like, I got to tap it with the hammer.  Your mic sounds like crap.  Yeah.  And it's on the verge of not working. 
[00:01:00]  Is it?  Yeah.  All right.  But this is what it's come down to in radio where you give like the broadcasters tools to fix their own equipment, huh?  Yeah.  It's just a hammer.  To bang on the microphone with to make it work.  You're like almost distorting.  Am I?  Yeah.  And you're tinny.  I feel lower than...  Well, I can turn you up over here, but...  My volume feels a little lower than...  But you don't have any balls to your voice today.  No, I'm going to have to make my own. 
[00:01:30]  Yeah, there's no...  Like, nope.  Doesn't sound like there's any ballsy processing on it.  Oh, I don't know.  I don't care.  As long as they can hear me.  I don't care if it sounds like a 1998 podcast on real audio.  I was going to go with a real audio joke myself.  God, are we dating ourselves?  1998 real audio.  Hey, you hear about this new thing, real audio?  It's just amazing.  Fantastic.  Good morning.  Welcome to the O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[00:02:00]  We got lots to do.  We really got to get into some things today.  Anthony is the Kreskin when it comes to Wall Street.  You're just brilliant when it comes to what's going on.  Well, I got my...  I'm so glad I got you right across from me to get all the stock advice.  O.P., I like giving information about Wall Street to the people on Main Street.  Yeah, you're brilliant when it comes to this stuff.  Why are you doing radio?  You should be on CNBC every morning. 
[00:02:30]  I know.  I should have my own Wall Street show.  I say F. Jim Kramer.  We got Anthony Cumia.  Get me in there.  Wait till you hear how I just nailed what was happening in the market.  You want to do it now?  I'm pretty proud.  You want to do it now?  Yeah.  All right.  This is what Anthony said yesterday.  Remember.  This is yesterday pre-market open.  Remember, it's pre-market open.  So don't say, oh, he must have said this after 9.30 when it opened.  No, this was first thing in the morning.  This was Anthony's prediction yesterday.  Yep.  Yesterday.  We go back in time. 
[00:03:00]  Yep.  Here's my prediction for today.  I don't know.  I'm talking out my crack.  But I believe the market will go up today.  I think we're going to have an upturn.  I think a lot of people know that a lot of these stocks are oversold.  What is the credit?  There's mortgage problems, the credit problems.  They passed this bill for this huge frigging bailout.  So what's all the panic about?  There you go.  See?  That was yesterday.  Mm-hmm. 
[00:03:30]  Market was down.  How many points, Stump Brain?  500 and change.  500 and change.  See, I meant to say down.  That was just a quick error I made when I said upturn.  I meant downturn.  See, everyone knows about my sports curse, but no one really gets hurt in the end.  It's like, ah.  No one gets hurt.  I bet $100.  That dope hope doesn't know anything about sports.  If anyone, like, bought stock yesterday based on my stupid opinion, you're an idiot. 
[00:04:00]  So much for retiring for you.  But I'll tell you, I think today.  Shut up.  No, actually, Dow futures down like 200 points.  It's going to be an ugly, ugly open.  All the gains we made in the last five years, goodbye.  Gonzo.  Gonzo.  We're at the same level as 2003.  The market has lost 1,000 points since the bailout was passed.  Yeah.  So that really did a lot of help. 
[00:04:30]  So it cost us billions of dollars to just have it do nothing as far as Wall Street went.  Well, we had to pay for the spa treatments of some of these CEOs.  Just an amazing story today.  You hear about this one?  We got to say hi to Robert Kelly, of course.  Hi, Bobby.  What are we?  Bail out AIG, right?  Yep.  And then it turns out a bunch of the big wigs, they went out to some spa in, what, Nevada or Colorado or somewhere?  California. 
[00:05:00]  California.  The same weekend as the bailout happens, there was a $400,000 weekend seminar for these guys.  Do you understand how stressful it is to be one of those guys and how they just need to relax maybe at a spa?  No!  Neither do I.  You know, no one listens to us, but we have the solution.  I know you watch TV all day long and I have the solution.  She has the solution.  This thing has the solution.  Opie and Anthony have the solution.  You drag some of these CEOs to the town square and you behead them. 
[00:05:30]  End of problem.  This spa should look like Dachau.  Right.  End of problem.  These bastards.  You do a little, we go a little third world nation, we said this, we go third world nation for one day  and we drag these CEOs out of their mansions, out of the spas, out of the whorehouses, out of the cracked ends  and we behead a couple of them.  Guess what?  Everyone's going to behave.  They're all going to behave and we'll be in the money again.  Meh, meh, meh, meh, meh. 
[00:06:00]  Why would anyone listen to us?  We're just dopey shock jocks.  Well, I won't disagree with that.  Robert Kelly, it's your birthday.  Happy birthday.  Thank you, Opie.  Is it your birthday today or is it one of these?  Well, it's not until Saturday, but I'm here today.  It's today.  No, I'm not a junior high girl.  It's my birthday week.  No, yeah.  If you were, I'd be sitting there, you'd be on my lap.  Just mentioning.  On your computer screen.  Yeah.  I think you're celebrating a birthday week. 
[00:06:30]  I think you just threw that out there like I wouldn't do that because that's for teenage girls,  but I'm starting to think you might actually have a birthday week.  No, I have a birthday.  Today's my birthday, and I usually don't celebrate it.  I get no phone calls from any of my friends.  Well, you know what?  We were going to do the right thing today.  Yeah.  You know, over there was going to be a nice, you would have been smelling the bacon by now  and the eggs.  Oh, really?  I swear to God.  Yep.  And damn Basil Tease, the guy overslept, our pal. 
[00:07:00]  I swear to God.  Ask Steve.  We were going to surprise you with a buffet.  I've never had anything from friends on a birthday.  Where you could actually, you know, make your own omelet, basically.  Oh, that's nice.  So just picture like a guy over there cooking because that's what was supposed to happen.  Cooking the best omelets I've ever had.  Best omelets.  Do what I do every birthday.  Just imagine that my friends got me something.  Hang on.  Let me do it.  It's easy for me.  Just imagine. 
[00:07:30]  Would it make you feel better if you hear it from Steve?  Because the guy really did oversleep.  We're so bummed.  Oh, really?  So maybe we might make a Starbucks run now for you.  Get you a muffin or something.  I already got it.  All right.  I'm sorry.  I bought my own birthday.  Happy birthday.  I came in last night.  My wife had no-carb brownies in the pan.  Yeah.  You ever taste them?  No.  There's no carb, no sugar.  No flavor.  No, yeah.  That's fantastic.  Yeah.  It tastes like eating the bottom of a shoe with candle wax. 
[00:08:00]  See, that's where you can't.  You got to eat the desserts.  I can't.  Eat the salads and all that, but don't try to get a healthy dessert.  You just have a dessert every once in a while.  Just a little bit.  A couple bites.  That's all you need there.  And the guy at Punchline Magazine last night at the show I did actually got me a big cake.  A cake surprised me with a big Robert Kelly with my face on the cake because I have never  gotten a birthday cake from friends.  Not that he's a friend of mine. 
[00:08:30]  But.  But.  It's like a start.  Maybe friends will catch on.  Yeah.  It does work, dude.  It does.  There was a bunch of people hanging around last night trying to get a piece of cake.  See?  Yeah.  There you go.  Hey.  Life for the party.  What's up with this paintball thing that Ant and I were not invited to?  Or were you invited to, Ant?  I was invited.  Oh, I wasn't.  Aw.  That's all right, though.  Wow.  Wow.  I so wasn't invited. 
[00:09:00]  They didn't invite you at all.  Are you sure you didn't get it?  I swear to God.  I understand.  You didn't get the.  I was not invited.  How was I invited?  Here comes Travis to clear it all up.  I'm scared.  I sent everyone an email.  I didn't get an email.  I didn't get an email.  Well, I didn't send you an email.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Well, I did not get an email for the big paintball day.  Well, I definitely sent you one.  Great.  I would not lie.  So you put his headphones on for that. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah, I know.  I sent you one.  You want to take a seat before Mike?  Sure, you know.  No, it was for a fan's little bachelor party.  Right.  No, I honestly didn't think I was invited.  What is going on with, what is going on with bachelor parties?  Why are bachelor parties turning into paintball and other things that have nothing to do with disgusting strippers and being at a friend's house with, you know, the show that the whore would put on, that the pimp would bring. 
[00:10:00]  You know, that's your typical, like, bachelor party.  Right now, it's like, hey, the guys are going to go play paintball or the guys are going to go and golf.  It's a golf day bachelor party for the.  What?  Nobody wants to get warts for their wedding.  That happened, like, three times and they said, let's not do this anymore.  Nobody wants for yourself. 
[00:10:30]  Your poor wife's ovary turns into the size of a grapefruit because you had some dumb bachelor party.  No one wants to be humiliated by a stripper that's maybe a three.  Exactly.  Maybe a three.  You go home from one of those parties with the same welts you get from paintball.  Yes, the same thing.  What are these on my skin?  Something's popping up here.  Nothing beats the old days where you're in some local bar and the stripper shows up for the bachelor party and the owner goes, ah, we better lock the front door. 
[00:11:00]  Time to lock the door.  They put the private party sign written in crayon on the door.  I went to one of my cousin's bachelor parties and it was somewhere in Hicksville and we couldn't get in because we were there a little late and the front door was locked.  Can't open that door now.  It's like a speakeasy.  I have no idea.  Let me in and see.  I have no idea what happened while we were outside, but all hell was breaking loose inside.  Yeah, it's like 30 bucks to go to the bathroom with a girl. 
[00:11:30]  So I've had a few bachelor parties over, not had, but went to a few bachelor parties from friends that had a couple of girls come over and do a show in the house.  Yeah.  So they're like on the couch and toys were involved and it was just a, what a scene, what a scene.  And then, yeah, the bachelor is in the bathroom with one of the hookers.  It's just, it really, maybe the paintball thing is good.  Maybe you really can't get into much trouble.  You can wash paint off. 
[00:12:00]  Yeah.  It's harder to get blood out of your jeans than paint.  And I don't know if you could wash off AIDS.  I was going to say you can't wash off chlamydia.  Chlamydia, yeah.  Nice hot freckle.  Right.  Yeah, that's, maybe there is something to that.  I don't know.  It just seems bachelor party is still that thing that should be the last blast.  And I'm not talking, you know, getting favors from these girls, but a bunch of guys around  with some beers, watching girls just go at each other. 
[00:12:30]  A lot of guys are doing like, you know, you do the golf during the day and then you do  the old school bachelor party type thing or you do paintball.  You guys didn't do the strip thing after paintball, did you?  No, we actually did paintball naked.  We stripped.  All right.  Well, there you go.  From the welts on Travis, it looked like they did.  Travis is a little.  Bob shot me from about five feet away in the back.  Ooh, yeah.  Oh, you should have.  Is that the night before?  Yeah.  And then we went paintballing.  Let me tell you the move I did on him.  Ooh.  I was to the, you'd love this. 
[00:13:00]  I don't know why you didn't show up, Anthony.  Yeah.  Because you're such a psycho with guns.  I know.  And you can buy like a machine gun paintball.  It's fantastic.  There's like a $1,300 paintball gun that shoots 9,000 paintballs a second.  I can just see you out there with all your camo on.  All the stuff you have already.  Yeah.  Everything I own already.  Take your four stars and put them on your sleeve.  The gun just sounds like one of those guns.  There's fires coming out of the end of it.  Fallings. 
[00:13:30]  Just shoots a line.  Yeah.  No space between the bullets whatsoever.  It's just a line.  I ran out around the side, took out three of them from behind.  Oh, nice.  But you can't, look, you can't stop shooting.  Because these paintball guns, the ones they rent, there's no accuracy.  Like, you know, the first six come out left, right, and then twirl around.  So you just, you're so nervous that they're going to shoot you.  You just keep, you da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  Keep going.  Right.  Until you see them, you have to hear, I'm out, I'm out, I'm out, I'm out, I'm out, I'm out, I'm out, I'm out. 
[00:14:00]  A right, a right, a right.  A right.  I'm hit.  I'm hit.  I'm hit.  You're losing it.  What are you doing?  Bob, at one point, fell to the ground after being hit about 18 times.  Like, I'm not a sniper over here, I'm not one shot, one kill, I'm spraying the area.  Yeah, exactly.  Danny, Danny was the best, because he gets so angry.  Well, Danny has a reason, from what I heard, to be angry about his outing.  He does, and he did, you did get, but even when I shot him one time, he got mad at me. 
[00:14:30]  I did not get mad at you.  You were mad, dude, Danny, when you go, I went, this is Danny, dude, I hit you too!  It's like, I felt like I was with my stepfather back in, like, third grade, when I came home late from school.  Well, you know what it was?  It was a combination, it's a combination of, like, you know, getting hit in the back, you know, in the lower back with, like, 70 paintballs.  And, you know, these guns, they're so inaccurate that you'll unload, like, what has to be, you know, 15 to 20 paintballs, 
[00:15:00]  and because each one is going a separate direction, you know, I'm getting hit, and I'm shooting at Bobby,  and I'm like, Bob, I had to have hit you with that flurry of paintballs.  Yeah, it's going all over the place, yeah.  He hit me on the side, I couldn't feel it, he hit me on the, nicked me on the side of my paint, where my paintball canisters were.  So you don't feel it, yeah.  So I didn't feel it, but, you know, it's like, we're both shooting at each other at the same time.  It's like, I hit you, it's like, I hit you too!  Of course you did.  What do you want me to do?  The only way we're going to solve this is we use real bullets, and then somebody...  See who dies.  Yeah, that's it.  That's the only way this is really going to be solved.  And then what was happening, you just kept getting shot in the face. 
[00:15:30]  Well, yeah, because, you know, the way that the paintball face masks work, you know, there's a lot of face coverage,  but there's also vents so that you don't overheat and everything.  But it seemed like every round on every field that we did, I would get shot in such a way where the paint would explode through the vents.  Just cover my face and the inside of the goggles.  And what mature way did you handle that?  I said, I'm so sick of getting shot in the face!  And then I took off the face mask, I threw it to the ground, and a big piece of it cracked off. 
[00:16:00]  Dude!  You can hear him in the woods, just him in the woods.  Like, I'm hiding behind a log, it's all quiet, and you hear Danny, I'm sick of getting hit in the face!  It's always in the face!  What the hell?  Because it's no big deal, because it's, I mean, obviously it doesn't hurt, because it's hitting the mask,  but, like, whatever grease or petroleum base is in that paint, it just gets all over the inside,  and it takes you forever to try to scoop out all the paint.  Yeah, then you're walking around, you can't see through your goggles, it's all smeared.  Yeah, it's just a smeared mess, you're like, are you on my team, or ow! Stop! 
[00:16:30]  But then you rub it off, and you kind of clean it, but it's still that oil on there,  so when the sun hits that oil, you can't see anything.  It gets in nothing.  Driving westbound, it's sundown.  Yeah, right?  You're hiding behind a log, and everything's blurry, it's like you just lost your sight,  and someone's coming to get you.  And from the second that you're out, you spend that entire time cleaning the inside of that stupid face mask  right until the next round starts, and then within 40 seconds, poof, you get another one right to the face. 
[00:17:00]  Well, now I've got to start this process all over again.  I also heard that you showed up in full, like, oh, I didn't mess around.  Camos?  Dude, I went to the Army-Navy store the day before, and it loaded up.  I got digital Marine camo.  Yes, Sam told me, like, you all met outside the radio station or whatever,  and there you are in full camo, ready to go.  I had my Top Gun sunglasses with the curl around here.  I had my Afghani scarf.  Oh, no.  Oh, I had the Afghani scarf. 
[00:17:30]  You're ready to go.  I bought the boots.  I had the whole deal.  And I'm getting a vest.  Next time I go, I'm getting a Kevlar vest.  Yeah.  Because that hurts.  Yeah, a lot of the guys on the teams wear the vest.  I wasn't even the worst.  We showed up, and there's guys with fake badges, fake patches.  I mean, these guys look like mercenaries.  Yes.  And they have M16s.  Like, they look like legitimate M16s that shoot, like, 30,000 balls a second.  I used to go there, the same field, out in Corum, right? 
[00:18:00]  Yeah.  I used to go there, and it was single-shot nil spot, they were called, bolt-action pistol,  where it fit 10 rounds in it, and then you had to rock it back and forth to try to get  it to drop into the chamber before you could close the bolt, and then one shot, boom.  You had to pump it, right?  No, it wasn't even a pump thing.  Yeah, then they came out with a pump thing to chamber it.  Right.  And then there was a modification you could make by taking one of the tubes, the paint 
[00:18:30]  balls came in, shoving it in the front, so the ball would drop right into the chamber.  And we slowly watched these things evolve until they got constant air, which is the big  tank, and then, you know, it just got crazy.  But the original ones, when we went, were just single-shot bolt-action pistols, like  the Civil War or something.  No, not these, man.  Which would actually probably be better.  Okay, one shot.  You had to be really good at creeping around, and you had to be a little more stealthy.  You couldn't just run in. 
[00:19:00]  Not this.  Guns blazing into a flag station.  We went through almost 20,000 paintballs.  Jeez.  See, that's insane.  That's crazy.  Sam?  Yeah, not only was Bob in full regalia, but when we got there, Travis had rented a minivan,  so I showed up, and it was just me and Travis there, and he was on the phone with Bob,  but who was somewhere, we still don't know to this day where he was, stalking us, telling  us every car that was passing by, saying, hey, tell Sam to get back in the van.  Tell him to get back in the van.  And then Bob drives by us in this Explorer and jumps out of the car in full regalia with 
[00:19:30]  sunglasses on, grabs me, throws me in his car.  And kisses you.  Yeah, and tells me I'm on his...  Yeah, Bob made Sam drive all the way out there with him in his car instead of with everyone  else.  Sam was the lamb in Jurassic Park.  Yeah.  We kept sending him out there, because he had his little afro, his little afro.  You could hit him in the head, and every paintball would bounce off his head. 
[00:20:00]  Actually, yeah, because I pulled the hood up over my hair, and at one point, I got hit  in the head like three or four times, and they didn't break, and they didn't hurt.  They just bounced off the top of my head.  You have packing material on your head.  Yeah, no kidding.  That's what it is.  But they realized I was getting shot first every time, so they were like, okay, here's  the new strategy.  We're just going to send Sam out far and in the middle.  That way, if he gets shot, he would have gotten shot anyway.  And if he doesn't, he's in a good spot.  You just scream out.  Right up the middle.  You just hear little Sam's voice.  Sam, you all right?  Yep.  I'm here. 
[00:20:30]  Hey, I don't want to lose this phone call.  We were talking about bachelor parties, because this paintball thing was a bachelor party.  And there was a guy, and he couldn't hang on, unfortunately, because we're talking about  how lame some of these strippers are and some of these bachelor parties are, and how you  don't want to go home with warts and all that.  One guy swears that there was a girl that was able to, let's just say, spray something  at you.  All right.  And he didn't think that was...  AIDS? 
[00:21:00]  Well...  Yeah, some type of disease.  He wasn't happy, because he wasn't really part of anything, but he still had, you know,  this was happening at the party.  Yeah.  And then we got another guy, Bill in Jersey.  Bill!  Hello, Bill.  Hey, what's up, boys?  How are you, Bill?  Pretty good.  Yeah, my bachelor party was kind of cool.  My buddy Tony used to clear out his living room, an Italian fellow, and he had all those  four-foot-by-eight-foot wall mirrors on the back wall, and we took out, like, a folding 
[00:21:30]  lawn chair.  I sat down, you know how they ship you down in your underwear, and they put the lipstick  all around.  Mm-hmm.  Well, the dancer goes to step up on the lawn chair, or the folding chair, and her heel,  her spike heel, she had real high heels.  Well, she kind of went right through my underwear and right down in the area you don't want to  be stepped on.  Yeah, like, you know, why?  Yeah, why?  Right, bitch.  Well, she was kind of, like, putting her hands on the mirror and, like, kind of, like, you  know, giving me the motorboat kind of thing. 
[00:22:00]  Sure.  So, as she stepped on the mirror, I just leaned forward, because the pain was, like, insane,  and the folding chair just folded down, and she just went face-first into the mirror  and smashed it.  Nose was bleeding.  There was coke on the mirror and all.  It was a good time.  Yeah, nothing better than stripper bloopers.  Stripper bloopers.  They're the best, man.  Definitely be a show.  I'd watch that show every night, stripper bloopers.  They're trying to look all hot and sexy, and their high heels a little too high or something. 
[00:22:30]  I'd watch them crack an ankle.  Yeah, they break an ankle.  Just dumb stuff.  Everyone's laughing.  They break their neck because they don't know how to work.  Oh, did you hear that?  Oh, I heard that.  Yeah, sorry.  Which one, a red one or just a regular one?  Yeah.  All right, thank you, bro.  Watch you now, man.  Yeah, we're on to something with this bachelor party thing.  Maybe we'll take more phone calls after the break.  We do have to take a break.  Robert Kelly in the studio.  We'll also talk about the debate. 
[00:23:00]  Phone number 877-212-ON-A.  Stay there.  We'll get into the debate thing in a minute or two here on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Starring Robert Kelly.  But the phones are lit.  877-212-ON-A.  Talking about bachelor parties.  And Anthony made a pretty good point.  He said, what happened to the old school bachelor parties?  Now people are going to baseball games, football games, playing golf, paintball.  Yeah, they just do things a lot different than the old days where you just got the couple 
[00:23:30]  of whores and went over the best man's house or something and watched them do some kind  of disgusting acts with each other.  And then for a nominal fee, you would go in, file into various bathroom or room with the  strippers, hookers, whatever you want to call them.  And they would give sexual favors to the people in the town.  What? 
[00:24:00]  That was well put.  Yeah.  I got to say, and this is the God's honest truth, I swear on my family.  Never partook in bachelor party whoredom as far as going into the rooms or anything.  They just, always the skeeviest girls.  The skeeviest strippers go to bachelor parties.  I get uncontrollable.  Really?  Really?  Yeah, I went to one at a restaurant in Boston.  They shut the restaurant down late at night, and then they brought these girls in, and 
[00:24:30]  they did the little dance thing.  Yeah.  I didn't even know that they were going to be, I thought it was just a dance.  You know, like they do this dance or whatever.  What, like Lord of the Dance?  Yeah.  Imagine you order some dance, you got some dances coming in, and they just do river dance  and leave.  Just a guy in tight pants.  That would suck.  With bottle caps on the bottom of his sneakers.  Awful music and awful no-hand dancing.  Then they just leave, and you're all dumbfounded.  So what happened? 
[00:25:00]  They did their dance.  They did.  And then my friend went to the bathroom, and I didn't know what was going on.  And then I went to the bathroom.  She's like, you know, 60 bucks.  So I just turned into a psychopath.  I didn't have the money, because I was waiting tables at the time.  I was just bumming money off mob guys that were there.  I didn't even know them.  I'll pay you back.  I don't care what the vig is.  I was just losing my mind.  Just losing my mind.  Every time I get into that situation where the girls just become dirty, even here. 
[00:25:30]  You know me.  You know when you have the girls in here, and they start taking clothes off and doing weird  stuff, I turn into the other Bob.  Bob, I get really uncontrollably.  Just go a little crazy.  Yeah, my eyes start to roll back in the back of my head.  His eyes do start spinning.  I've seen him.  He gets that voice on him.  Yeah.  That Bob voice.  Yeah, why don't you come over here and just take that down enough so I can see the panties.  Take it down.  And it's like, ew, it's Creepy Bob.  It is.  Yeah, Creepy Bob.  I don't like Creepy Bob.  Mommy, I don't like Creepy Bob. 
[00:26:00]  Right.  So what disease did you get from this hooah?  Um, I got hammock sack.  I don't know.  I got nothing.  I didn't get anything.  But that's just weird.  I don't know if I got anything from that.  There's so many dirty scenarios that I've been involved in.  You never know where.  Come from anywhere, right?  Yeah, you can never come from a toilet seat.  I got a bachelor party coming up.  And my only request, I don't want to be the, you know, I don't want to be the naked guy in front of everybody being humiliated by the damn stripper. 
[00:26:30]  That's another type of bachelor party.  That's the one where, but it usually takes a real drunk groom.  See, the bachelor, it's in a strip club most of the time, and they get the guy up there, the bachelor, hammered, and, yeah, starts stripping him, riding him like a horse.  All right, now you're a horse.  You're a bad boy.  Why spanking him and all the friends taking pictures and laughing? 
[00:27:00]  This is the worst.  They put the phallic symbol in the guy's mouth.  Yeah, what's that about?  Yeah, that'll happen.  And then you can't pull it out because he's just sucking on it.  Well, no, because then they have to tie your hands.  No, that didn't happen.  It's ridiculous.  That's not fun.  Hell, no.  Let's go to Ray in Ohio.  I don't want to lose those calls.  Ray, what do you got, buddy?  Emphysema, apparently.  No kidding.  What's up, guys? 
[00:27:30]  How are the homeless zombies up there in Cleveland?  Oh, not as bad as they are in Detroit.  You think Detroit has worse homeless zombies?  Fuck yeah.  Oh, hey, all right.  Oh, come on, don't stop it.  Wow.  What do you got, Ray?  So anyhow, I was at this bachelor party like seven years ago.  The best man hires these two whores to come over, and they're going at it all through the house.  You know, kitchen, living room, couches.  They end up on this guy's motorcycle. 
[00:28:00]  Well, it's time for them to call it quits, but packing it in, you know?  And they ask for more money than was already agreed upon, and the guy refuses to pay him the more money.  So these two broads call the cops.  And there's all kinds of illegal substances and stuff.  So the cops resolve it.  Like the ones you're on right now.  You are just a rambling drunk.  I'm a rambling, just woke up.  Oh, okay. 
[00:28:30]  All right.  Oh, Ohio.  He's from Ohio.  Wow.  One of those people.  He's offended really easy.  I don't care about the rest of his story.  You don't?  All right.  Bambi.  It's just a guy.  He was boring.  Let's go to Bambi.  On and on.  And then they...  The cops showed up.  Hold on.  We got Bambi.  We got one of these whores that do the bachelor parties.  Oh, Bambi.  Hi, Bambi.  Hi.  How are you?  Yeah.  What are you doing?  How are you?  I'm actually just recovering from last night's party.  Oh, really?  No, no.  Not really.  No. 
[00:29:00]  No.  The McCain celebration after the debate.  Sitting there trying to get him to walk.  I hired a couple of whores for my own party.  Oh, Bambi.  Oh, Bambi, believe it or not.  Oh, jeez.  Oh, gosh.  Oh, my God.  This is hilarious.  You guys have to stop talking about what goes on because now, you know, all these women 
[00:29:30]  who are listening, they're not going to let their husbands go to the bachelor parties.  Where have they been?  A vault?  I think at this point, the women know or at least knew what went on at bachelor parties.  Nowadays, you know, they play paintball.  I think you guys are, well, maybe not you guys, but most guys are good enough liars.  Are you really a stripper that does bachelor parties?  No, absolutely not.  I actually have a little show, Foxy and Bambi show.  What is it called?  Oh, the Foxy and Bambi show.  What is that?  What do you do? 
[00:30:00]  What or who?  No.  Oh, you.  Oh, boy.  We have a little show on public access in Queens.  Really?  What do you do?  Yeah, it's just kind of a satire show.  What do you do?  Well, you can check us out and find out.  How about I do this?  Joker, what's going on?  What's up, guys?  Joker.  Hey, a buddy of mine, Steak, just had a bachelor party over at my place. 
[00:30:30]  How's the best, man?  Nice.  And we had the familiar stripper.  And needless to say, he was pretty drunk.  And she was doing her grind on him.  And he passed out.  And it pissed her off.  And so she had us turn him over and drop trowel and had another one of our buddies lay on top of him and revive him.  How'd you get your other buddy to do that? 
[00:31:00]  Really?  Really.  That way.  Sounded like he was a bit willing to do this.  I'll do it.  I'll help.  We need a volunteer.  Okay.  Me, me, me, me, me, me, me.  Ooh, ooh, ooh, Mr. Kata.  Yeah, me, me, me.  All right, let's go to Philly.  Ted.  Ted.  Hi, Ted.  Hi, Ted.  I love Ted.  Yeah.  I was at a bachelor party down here in Philly.  The strippers would take the kids. 
[00:31:30]  The bachelor party emporium.  I miss Jimmy.  No offense.  And put them in their most private of places.  Paste them in whipped cream and actually shove them inside.  And then auction them off.  And guys were lining up buying them.  It was nasty.  So the stripper had some cherries and some whipped cream and she wasn't using her hands basically, right?  Pretty much, yeah.  Why would you do that? 
[00:32:00]  I don't know.  There's no reason to do that.  What do you get?  Then you turn around, high five your buddies.  You go, yeah.  Cold sores for everyone.  Yeah.  I was nasty.  There was guys turning around.  They had whipped cream all over their faces.  They had a little cherry stem in their mouth.  Yeah.  The next Sunday during the tailgating, you all have a nice big cold sore.  Yeah.  What happened?  But you're all bonding.  My lip is tingly.  All I wanted was a cherry.  What happened?  I like cherry. 
[00:32:30]  It feels funny.  It's wonderful Philly women for you.  Why is it itching?  Was she hot?  Was she really hot?  Oh, no.  They were silly women.  The bachelor party stripper.  Come on, Bob.  I've had a couple hot ones.  The bachelor party strippers?  Yeah.  Never seen a hot one.  Seen acceptable ones where you're not repulsed.  But most of the time, they're repulsive, like big ass.  They can't get the good gigs.  It's between stripper and hooker. 
[00:33:00]  They can't figure out which one.  You want to be a stripper or you want to be a hooker?  Right.  Come on.  There's a different rating scale for a hooker stripper.  Yeah.  You understand that a stripper or just a hooker?  Yeah, that's true.  But I mean, I think that a stripper or hooker at a bachelor party is hot.  Probably the ones that are hot are thin.  They got a nice little bum.  They got the small boobies.  Can I say boobies?  Sure.  Boobies with some stretch marks. 
[00:33:30]  From the five kids they had.  Oh.  With black eyes.  Of course.  And they have like little pimples down there.  Oh, really?  A couple little razor burns.  Razor burns?  Yeah, they got the razor burn.  That's hot, Bobby.  Sometimes you got to wonder, what's worse?  Like some hair or just razor burn?  Right.  And razor bumps.  Looks like a linebacker's neck.  I would. 
[00:34:00]  All right, guys.  Punch it.  I'd rather see like.  Hair.  Hair.  Yes.  I'm not talking a jungle.  Yeah.  But I'd rather see a little bit of just natural hair than razor burn.  Yeah.  Like poison ivy.  Like.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It just looks like a lot of bumpies going on.  Yeah.  I hate bumps.  I hate the little bumps.  Yeah.  The ingrown hair.  Ow.  Ow.  It looks like Mars.  Just all the little pimples with the red dots. 
[00:34:30]  Volcanic action happening.  Ha.  Let's.  Who's this?  We don't have a name on the screen.  Who is this?  Hello, sir.  You.  Striker.  Striker.  What's up, buddy?  Striker.  Hey, buddy.  Hey.  Got a good one for you.  About 15, 20 years ago, I went to a friend's bachelor party.  And we got raided by the fight squad.  The guy who.  The guy who.  Who held the bachelor party.  We didn't know was dealing coke on the side.  Oh, nice.  That's good. 
[00:35:00]  Isn't that a surprise?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And, you know, there was a bunch of hookers there.  And, you know, it was about 30 to 40.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Morse code's coming in.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Sell.  Sell.  Sell.  Sell.  Sell.  Sell.  Sell.  Is that a stock ticker?  Right.  What do you got in the background?  When you said you got a good one, you didn't mean your  phone.  Sorry.  I'm driving through the mountains.  It's about the greatest location.  What?  NORAD?  Yeah.  Put up more towers.  Who cares about the mountains?  We need good cell signals. 
[00:35:30]  All right.  Thank you, Stryker.  Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.  I've never heard a phone do that.  When you talk, it beeps.  Do you remember, it's weird, we're talking about this, because over the weekend, I went  old school, we were talking about the old radio show.  Remember the woman that came in?  The video's kind of hard to find these days, but the girl that was able to throw eggs from  her you-know-what without using her hands?  Oh, yeah.  She was a legendary bachelor party girl.  Yeah.  An egg is a heavy item.  She used it like, she was able to use- 
[00:36:00]  I can't even explain.  She would get on a table, and she would be on her hands and her legs and on her feet at  the same time with her butt in the air.  Yeah.  And she had some kind of motion.  It was like a hip motion, and it looked like, I swear, like David and Goliath, like his sling.  It would just sling the egg out.  Would she grab it, like a little of those coin-operated denim machines?  She loaded the weapon, but then used no hands after that. 
[00:36:30]  And we set up a measuring, I don't know.  Yeah, it was a tarp with a bunch of increments and feet on it.  Yeah.  And we would see how far she could sling it.  Yeah, it was pretty much a horror Olympics.  And I'm telling you, 10 feet, Ant?  Wasn't that the girl that we also had a blind guy with a basket trying to catch the eggs?  Yeah, Dave from the Boston area.  Blind Dave with a basket.  Yeah, he would hold a basket, and we would go, to the right, to the left! 
[00:37:00]  I believe that was our Easter party.  That's our inimitable style of celebrating the Lord's coming back.  And then we had wiffle ball bats, and we started doing batting practice.  On what?  The eggs coming at you.  Yeah.  That would be a good search.  Faceful egg.  Can we find that video and just watch it ourselves, and maybe we could kind of scrap, talk people  through it?  I don't know.  It wasn't really a scrapping.  No, it wasn't.  We did a lot of things back in the day that was worth scrapping to, but that was more like 
[00:37:30]  a freak show.  Anytime a girl would do something entertaining with her body, she was usually not very attractive.  Yeah.  There were a couple that were like good, but when you really get in depth into entertaining  the show, there was a problem.  External stuff is good, like knife girl, things like that.  Uh-huh.  Uh, but whenever things were happening that were really sensitive, uh, wow, what pigs. 
[00:38:00]  Yeah.  Well, the girl that could smoke.  Remember all the girls that we would go, wow, you're hot.  They weren't.  No, but nine out of ten, they weren't.  You're just trying to get them to do stuff?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  We were brilliant.  And we were trying to bamboozle the audience a little bit.  The psychological babble you have to go through to get a girl to be an idiot.  We had a camera that updated every, like, five, ten minutes, so it didn't matter.  Yep.  One frame per ten minutes.  But that egg chick, man.  An egg is a heavy thing to pick up. 
[00:38:30]  Oh, wait, here we go.  Someone, uh, I can confirm this.  Frankie in New York.  Frankie.  We believe you.  Yeah.  This girl was at your bachelor party?  Actually, I used to work at, uh, bars and clubs, and this girl was named Sexy Selena.  She was from the Bronx.  Oh, I think that is her.  And, uh, she used to, she used to shoot the eggs out with such velocity that, you know,  I, I mean, you, she could shoot them across the room, like ten feet, you know, she could  shoot them out, like ten feet across the room.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, we saw that.  And that was a gig, Wiffle Bats, you know?  Yeah. 
[00:39:00]  Sexy Selena.  Was, was that the best thing we saw?  Uh, we used to.  No, cigarette smoking.  We used to experiment with that part of the body all the time.  Yeah, the cigarette smoking was quite impressive.  We did a lot of research.  We were like a master's in Johnston.  We should have, uh, actually gotten, Bobby.  We should have been, uh, published.  Myth busters of the, uh, Bobby.  I can't say that.  I'll get that because, uh, we'll leave it in this context.  Yeah.  And we can still talk about it.  Okay.  Yeah.  Just, just, uh, let us lead here, Bobby.  Sorry.  Um, the, the best thing we ever tried was, uh, the cell phone trick. 
[00:39:30]  And this was when, now you say cell phone, we try to get a cell phone, a ring.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know where.  We try to see if we can get a signal.  Right.  And, and, and to everybody listening right now, they're like, yeah, what's the big deal?  But you got to remember, this was about six or seven years ago when the phones were still  quite large.  People looked at a StarTac and went, wow.  Yeah.  That is a tiny little phone.  The cord is coming out and it's attached to the big battery.  It's a brick. 
[00:40:00]  Those just brick phones.  Hey, Bobby, here's the girl in action.  We're getting, uh, some stills right now.  Wow.  Oh my God.  Yeah.  See that?  She kind of just threw her hip and that thing went flying.  An action shot?  I still don't know how she did it.  I don't know how she did it.  That's a great shot.  Isn't that amazing?  Studied with chickens.  But it was a Chinese chicken.  Yeah.  I forgot how rude she was.  But the, uh, trying to get the cell phone to ring.  Blind game with a basket.  Trying to get the cell phone to ring was one of our greatest moments. 
[00:40:30]  We failed, by the way.  It doesn't ring?  We're going to have to try that one again.  Couldn't get a signal.  Try it with Verizon.  And, and a bit we used to do, uh, and we did this not too long ago.  Yeah.  Was, uh, uh, the foaming, uh, oh, with the Mentos and the soda.  Oof.  That was another experiment we tried.  Well, we did that recently and we should do that one again.  Yeah.  The foaming blank.  You're going to kill somebody.  No, it was pretty funny.  Mentos?  And, and Pepsi Cola?  Yeah.  Just like those videos on YouTube, but you use something else instead of those dumb Pepsi bottles. 
[00:41:00]  But what if it goes the other way?  A Pepsi bottle only goes one way.  Nah, it's okay.  No, we, we understand how rocket motors work.  Yeah, but I understand.  Every action has an equal and opposite reaction.  You have a combustion chamber and then, see, here's how a rocket engine works.  You have a combustion chamber.  Yes.  Then you have a tube from the combustion chamber out to the exhaust.  Right.  And it will always shoot out the exhaust because, uh, you know.  What if at the top of that tube it led to another canal that went up? 
[00:41:30]  You're talking about a breach and a combustion chamber?  Yes.  That's catastrophic failure.  Then that would be bad.  Oh my God.  Every.  We have an anomaly.  We have an anomaly.  And let's not forget, uh, the bottle rocket too.  We did a lot of things with that.  That part of the body.  Mm-hmm.  A bottle rocket?  You never heard of the bottle rocket one?  That was our celebration of 4th of July.  We, we launched a bottle rocket.  Yeah.  Down the hall.  We had to build a heat shield so everything was protected. 
[00:42:00]  You guys are the myth busters.  Yeah, we are the myth busters.  Of the woman's lower extremities.  Yeah.  How was that, buddy?  Fantastic.  Yeah, we, uh, we did a lot of cool, uh, experiments back in the day.  Yeah.  You, what even, what smoking was great?  I don't understand.  A girl, a girl would smoke.  Mm-hmm.  She would actually be able to take a drag and then blow out and do, uh, smoke rings.  Mm-hmm.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Not kidding.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  It was fascinating.  She could inhale the cigarette.  Inhale.  You'd see the end light up. 
[00:42:30]  You'd see the end go, like when you take a drag.  Yeah, it would get brighter.  Mm-hmm.  And, and then, uh, she, she would, uh, exhale, exhale the smoke.  And then.  Little smoke rings would come out.  You're out of your mind.  She'd have to tap.  She'd have to tap a little for the smoke ring.  Tap what?  A stomach?  Yeah.  Uh, tap, you know.  Tap a little.  Tap your tummy.  And then you get smoke rings.  Yeah.  She's fascinating.  There's no way that can happen.  Yes.  Fascinating.  There's no way.  Look at that picture of the girl that, uh, the egg trick. 
[00:43:00]  See?  Batting practice.  The Mets needed her.  I told you.  Let's say hi to Ryan in Boston listening on BCN.  Ryan, how are you, buddy?  Yellow.  Ryan.  Oh, Ryan.  Are you there?  Brandon?  All right, Brandon.  Oh, Brandon.  Whatever.  What's up, Brandon?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Listen, I recently just had a bachelor party, and, uh, we had a couple girls come over.  One of the girls just had a baby, like, three weeks ago.  She was absolutely disgusting. 
[00:43:30]  But at one point during the show, she started lactating from her boobies.  Nice.  And, uh, it was terrible.  We paid her 20 bucks to, uh, lactate and a cup of coffee, and we gave it to the, uh, groomed-to-be.  Yeah.  I think I'm going to hell.  Well, the guys here had, um, ice cream made out of, uh, human milk.  So, no biggie.  Uh, by the way, I was, I got sick from that.  I forgot to tell you.  I was sick for three days.  Of course.  Why would you do that?  I was sick for three days.  I wasn't even going near that. 
[00:44:00]  So whatever Pat Duffy's sister had, I got.  Thank you, Pat.  Pat Duffy's sister was, uh, was expressing, uh, milk and then storing it in the fridge,  like they do, in little packets, and he brought a couple of packets in, they had an ice cream  maker, and put it in and made ice cream out of human milk.  Yeah.  And then ate it.  And, and at first, at first, it was like, okay, that's not that.  Oh, there's an aftertaste. 
[00:44:30]  It was all about the aftertaste.  The first, uh, initial, you know, taste was just like any type of ice cream.  And then everyone was saying that it was gamey.  It's like, how do you eat gamey ice cream?  Like venison?  Yeah, yeah.  Like venison or pasta.  Like venison chili.  It looks like chili, and it almost tastes like it, and then it hits you.  It's a little gamey.  That's kind of what was going on.  Ice cream should never be gamey.  Ice cream shouldn't taste like meat.  No, there shouldn't be a meat, like, yeah, some kind of meat thing going on with ice cream.  Yeah. 
[00:45:00]  Is your sister, like, eat oats and just chew on grass in the backyard?  Yeah, what are you doing to make her, her milk gamey?  Oh, let's go to Chuck before we lose him.  Chuck?  Yo, what's going on, guys?  Hey, Chuck.  Good morning.  Um, I got a video that a couple of my buddies sent me on my cell phone of a woman giving  herself a fright enema and shooting it out, like, 50, 60 feet.  Right?  That probably won't wash.  Yeah, I don't think that.  We should have, like, walked her through that one. 
[00:45:30]  Yeah.  You should have held your hands for that one, Chuck.  Yeah.  50 or 60 feet.  That's, uh, pretty insane.  You live in a mansion?  All right.  Well, we got more stories on the way.  There's, uh, a lot of good ones.  What people usually do with warm water to, uh, relieve certain afflictions that you might  have in your digestive system.  That's right.  Uh, this woman did with Sprite.  That's right.  You're a poet.  Which is interesting.  There was a guy, he might call back.  Wow.  He ended up in the hospital after his bachelor party from depression.  You know, you know what Patrice turned me on to that I love, but I hate, it just gets 
[00:46:00]  me aggravated, is that loveaboy.com, where it's the women's bachelor party.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm just watching this.  And they...  Thanks, Danny.  And they, uh...  Well, wait till after the break.  Yeah, because there's a stark difference.  And I know what you're going to get into.  Bad.  Women are worse than guys.  Oh, absolutely.  Because we've had this break many times.  We'll do it after the break.  Yeah.  I know exactly what you're getting into, and we'll talk about it. 
[00:46:30]  Uh, Opie and Anthony, Robert Kelly, sitting in for, uh, Jim Norton.  Norton was on Leno last night.  I'm hearing he killed.  I haven't seen the set yet.  We have a little too late, but everyone's saying he did a great job last night on Leno.  And I think he's going to be on Chelsea Handler tonight.  Maybe we can find out if that's, uh, going on tonight.  All right.  More in just a bit.  Happy anniversary to Steven S. from Bayshore.  Hey, Opie started writing the O&A rundown one year ago today.  How time flies. 
[00:47:00]  You can see that on O&A Radio.com.  I believe, uh, it's been a year, but I think it's going to be a rundown that will last a  thousand years.  He gets it.  That's all that matters, right?  Yes.  Robert Kelly's in for Jim Norton.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  It's my birthday.  Every other Nazi.  It's your birthday.  My anniversary, Friday.  Happy anniversary on the way. 
[00:47:30]  Uh, before we move on, we can get back to the, uh, bachelor party thing.  A lot of people still trying to get through with their stories, but, um, we do have to  acknowledge that some people saying musical dildos was the greatest thing we did as far as  experimenting with, uh, that, uh, Oh, right, right, right.  That part of a, uh, of a girl.  What is that?  Well, you know, we can't really explain it.  We don't have to explain it.  Yeah.  You ever play musical chairs?  Nah, you ruined it.  You think?  I think so.  Oh, no.  That's what they said. 
[00:48:00]  Oh, no.  That's what they told me.  Oh, no.  You can't equal it.  Oh, no.  Who's they?  Oh, no.  Really?  They is this entity that takes all the funny out of things.  Uh, really?  Yeah.  Uh.  They, they all know.  All right.  Let's figure it out.  We'll move on.  I didn't know.  I, I actually figured out a different thing.  You know, they, I get the, fill the glasses with water.  Oh, and they go.  Yeah.  Woop.  Woop.  Woop.  Woop. 
[00:48:30]  Woop.  Woop.  Woop.  Woop.  Woop.  Woop.  Woop.  Woop.  Woop.  That'd be a good one.  Woop.  Woop.  Woop.  Woop.  When you play the rim of the wine class.  It's time to bring back, uh, Blank Busters.  All right.  Hey, the debate.  There it is.  On TV.  It's on every TV right now.  Oh, yeah.  God, I, uh, I stayed up for that horse crap.  So did I.  Drudge Report.  One word.  Boring.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was, it was more fun.  You got to, uh, actually, um, get into a pal talk room with people that are watching 
[00:49:00]  it, and then you could goof on stuff back and forth.  Is that what you were doing?  Yeah.  It's kind of fun that way.  What was going on in the pal talk room?  Who won the debate?  Well, no one of our listeners, they're all for McCain, probably, right?  Uh, no.  You'd be surprised.  Really?  Yeah.  A lot of fun, you know, words being thrown around.  Well, that's what I'm getting at.  You know, certain people can't resist.  Like a CB radio?  Yeah, it is.  It's like a CB radio.  Uh-huh.  But, uh, yeah, no, I watched the, uh, the whole thing.  And, uh, wow.  Boring. 
[00:49:30]  I made it to 10 o'clock.  It's dull.  I was done.  They concentrated a lot on the economy, because that's, like, the big thing that these two  can try to rip each other apart on.  The thing about watching these debates is they both bash each other about either doing  or not doing something that's bad, whether they did it or didn't do it.  And then the other one stands up, denies that he ever did it, and then accuses the other  one of doing the same thing.  Yeah.  That he was just accused of.  So you sit there and go, well, now I've got to go and research this and find out who's 
[00:50:00]  lying.  And then there's, it's such government speak and lawyer talk when you're trying to read  through, you know, who actually signed off on certain bills and everything, that there's  no way the common man could actually figure this crap out.  So you're just stuck.  You sit there and watch these debates going, one of them or both of them are lying.  Why are they so polite to each other?  I mean, the body language made it look like they want to kill each other.  But when there was a chance to really go for it, they backed off.  Why? 
[00:50:30]  I don't know.  I think people are turned off by that these days in this politically correct age.  And especially when you got a black guy running, McCain isn't going to jump on him too bad  because it looks bad.  It's like, oh, sure.  You know, the old white guy is picking on the black guy.  And then Obama can't do it because he doesn't want to come off to the white voters like  an angry black guy.  This is just the way it is.  But there are a few times Obama's like, can I respond to what he just did?  That's crazy.  I told you this is a one minute statement. 
[00:51:00]  You're not supposed to do it.  Can I just tell you, you ruined the whole debate for me because all I pitched you was  you doing your...  Oh, Tom Brokaw.  Tom Brokaw.  I didn't even know he was going to be the moderator until I turned on the debate and  just went, thank you, God.  Because him as a moderator is just the dumbest thing.  Let's put in someone who can't speak.  Before we jump into this, we've got to play the intro because Tom Brokaw is worse than  we remember with those L's. 
[00:51:30]  As he gets older, he has a little wuffer.  I'm saying L's.  Good evening from Belmont University in Nashville, Tennessee.  I'm Tom Brokaw of NBC News, and welcome to this second presidential debate sponsored  by the Commission on Presidential Debates.  Tonight's debate is the only one with a town hall format.  The Gallup organization shows 80 uncommitted voters from the national area to be here with  us tonight.  And earlier today, each of them gave me a copy of their question for the candidates. 
[00:52:00]  From all of these questions and from tens of thousands submitted online, I have selected  a long list of excellent questions on domestic and foreign policy.  Neither the commission nor the candidates have seen the questions, and although we won't  be able to get to all of them tonight, we should have a wide-ranging discussion.  Three.  One month before the election.  Each candidate will have two minutes to respond to a common question, and there will be a one-minute  follow-up. 
[00:52:30]  The audience here in the hall has agreed to be polite and attentive.  No cheering or outbursts.  Those of you at home, of course, are not so constrained.  Pal talk.  Thanks.  Yeah, it sounds like he runs out of air or something.  There's something that comes out of the way, especially when he says L's.  Here, Tom Brokaw from NBC.  Hey, this debate will be in a town hall style, which took a lot of questions from a lot of  people, tens of thousands.  And then he's got to say, obviously, we will not get to all of them. 
[00:53:00]  Really?  I'd like to run through 10,000 questions with these two dolts.  It'll be November 1st.  All right.  Question number 500.  He had to get a little feisty a couple of times.  Oh, boy.  He keeps order, though.  You got to give it to old Tom Brokaw.  Yeah.  He keeps order.  Obama was going off.  He's like, Senator Obama, could you please keep your answers down for one minute?  I wrote down some of the words he had trouble with. 
[00:53:30]  Gallop.  Gallop.  The Gallop poll.  The Gallop poll.  Gallop.  Gallop poll.  Gallop.  He almost had a seizure trying to say Gallop poll.  Horse running poll.  Yeah.  I'll just say it that way.  You'll understand.  He also couldn't say earlier.  Earlier.  Earlier.  Earlier.  Earlier.  Yeah.  The time before or later.  Thank God the word online is not a popular word.  these days because he had a tough time with that one.  The intra-tubes. 
[00:54:00]  A long list he had a problem with.  A long list of questions that I called.  Yeah.  And then the simple word all.  All.  Yeah.  All.  All.  All.  All.  All.  All.  That marble mouth.  But he was moderating last night.  And he did say rule with an iron. 
[00:54:30]  I rule with an iron.  None of your.  Inanigans.  I don't understand why John McCain can't hold a microphone.  Okay.  We're taking questions from a block people.  Let's see how McCain handles this one.  Oh.  With contempt.  Yeah.  He wouldn't.  He wouldn't shake the hands of any of the.  Like.  I think there were two people.  He wouldn't acknowledge.  The first two people off the bat were black people in the town hall meeting. 
[00:55:00]  Yeah.  And.  He wouldn't acknowledge them or.  Well the black woman.  He forgot her name and didn't look at her.  Yeah.  Everyone else he was looking right in their eye.  Was literally like.  Yeah.  Feet away from them.  Well did you see that one Navy guy?  There was another Navy guy.  And.  He gave a question and said that he had served in the Navy.  And he was a chief petty officer or something.  And.  And McCain just friggin hobbled over there.  In that way where you clinch your butt cheeks when you gotta go real bad.  Yeah.  That's how he walks.  With the mic.  Held in his hand with his elbow at a perfect 90 degree angle. 
[00:55:30]  And he would just shuffle over there.  And he pats him on the back and kind of shakes his hand.  Robo McCain.  Did you see him drop the.  Every time he was done he'd.  Just his hand would let.  Release the mic.  Yeah.  And he'd catch it with the other hand.  The good hand.  I thought he was just going to slam it down like Eddie Murphy after a set.  Thank you.  Poof.  He moves.  Poof.  He moves like a South Park character.  Yeah.  His legs don't really.  He just kind of bobbles back and forth.  Poor bastard.  You don't want to make those jokes. 
[00:56:00]  He's a war hero and all that.  But man you look at him like.  Oh my God.  It looks painful just to breathe.  And that old bitty that got up and asked that question.  I don't even remember what the question was.  I was too fixated on her hick hillbilly old bitch delivery.  What are you going to do about.  What the black candidate.  How would McCain said that one.  Yeah.  That one. 
[00:56:30]  That one.  He was referring to Obama by saying that one.  Yeah.  That one.  That one.  They're trying to figure out what he meant by that.  Well we all know what he meant by that.  Well those people.  Yeah.  Oh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Those people.  Yeah.  And Tom.  Brokaw.  Whatever.  Yeah.  Just talking about the economy.  Yeah.  A lot of people worried about what's going to happen with the economy.  Being that they've lost their job.  A lot of unemployed.  A lot of people aren't working. 
[00:57:00]  And it's very difficult for Americans to live a lot, live a lot, live a lot, to get by.  Can you say Wall Street, Mr. Brokaw?  Oh.  Ah.  The problems on Wall Street.  Acting Main Street.  Wall Street.  That financial place down there with a bull.  Yeah. 
[00:57:30]  He was a treat to watch though.  You got to give it to him.  And you notice he's getting those Mr. Burns liver spots on the side of his head on the temples.  Ah.  None of us escaped that I guess.  Ah.  Yes.  Time will give you the liver spots.  Next question, Smithers.  He does.  He's got those three perfect liver spots on his temples.  I wanted someone to challenge Tom Brokaw when he was trying to get control of the situation.  It would have been great if Obama and McCain just said, shut up. 
[00:58:00]  Yeah.  Stop it.  There he is.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, he had to reprimand him a couple of times.  Yeah.  You see there's a lot, a lot, a lot, a lot.  The bright things on the floor to instruct you when the moon is up.  Yeah.  I don't f*** around.  I'm noticing that the f*** is really taking more time than the other guy.  God, what's wrong?  I'm not an anchor anymore.  I can say whatever the f*** I please. 
[00:58:30]  Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News.  We're here at the debate between the white guy and the f***.  Thank God for the beep button.  It's saving me.  You don't have to worry about ratings anymore, Mr. Brokaw.  I meant the white guy and the liberal.  Yeah.  Liberal.  That's what's toughie.  So, uh, who won the debate?  Who won the debate, Mr. Brokaw?  I, uh, believe I have to give it to, uh, Barack Obama. 
[00:59:00]  Yeah?  Yes, uh, as I looked on the screen, I saw the Ohio undecided...  I saw the undecided Ohio voters were actually paying more attention and liked what Obama  was saying more than me.  Did you notice that the women, uh, really, really liked the Obama guy?  Because he's got a huge f*** on the wall, Tommy. 
[00:59:30]  That's why they got jungle fever.  They got jungle fever.  They don't mind that stereotype, right, Tom?  No, of course not.  When he got up, of course, uh, it was like, uh, they just showed him from the waist up.  Yeah.  Because he had tremendous f*** who was just pushing out in front of the crowd.  Town hall meeting.  Style.  A lot of bitches up in this joint.  They were digging the Obama. 
[01:00:00]  They loved him.  Yeah.  I think he won.  He came across as in more, uh, a cash bowl.  And he could walk like he didn't have to take a s***.  It's like, jeez, come on, McCain, you've got a debate to go on.  Get in the bathroom and let out some s***.  He's looking like he's with his butt cheeks clenched, clenched, clenched, clenched, clenched tight.  Tightly together.  NBC Nightly in here. 
[01:00:30]  Yeah.  Tom Brokaw moderating this great debate where the excitement is just...  Jeep, jeep, jeep.  Jeep, jeep, jeep.  Uh, yeah, that was, uh, I was very happy to see him, uh, moderating.  I think he did do a good job, like, for the circumstance.  It was boring as hell.  They don't want to get into things.  And, uh, some of the, uh, talking heads afterwards were saying, um, this is not my beautiful wife. 
[01:01:00]  No.  They were saying...  They were saying they didn't get into a lot of the, um, other issues.  Like, like the basic things they get into.  Abortion, gun control, things like that.  Because the economy was just such a big issue.  And then they talk about health care and stuff.  But they've been missing so many things.  This was a carbon copy of, uh, of the last debate.  So, I don't know.  Well, illegal immigration was supposed to be a big, uh, topic. 
[01:01:30]  Yeah, that was, no, what happened to that?  We don't give a crap, because our 401s are going away.  Yeah, see what happened?  Let the Mexicans work on, I don't give a crap.  Bring them back in.  Ever since they started kicking them out, our economy sucks.  Yeah, right, exactly.  Bring them back.  Let them be.  Save my 401.  Uh, Jim in Ohio, how are you, buddy?  Hey, I'm good.  How are you doing?  Good.  Uh, I hope you went to bed too early.  Uh-huh.  You, uh, you missed how, um, Brokaw had the, um, problem with the word situation.  He was struggling through that one a little bit. 
[01:02:00]  Oh, really?  Hell yeah.  It's, uh, talking is a difficult system.  How did he get so far in, in, in media, in broadcasting with that impediment?  The guys at NBC must have been like, we need an anchor guy, the main guy, the main man.  Right.  Let's pick a guy that cannot say his L's and just hope no stories come up with L's.  Yeah.  Except for that first one he had.  The Achilles Loro.  The cruise ship Achilles Loro taken over by terror. 
[01:02:30]  Leon Klinghoffer was pushed on the deck of the Achilles Loro.  I can't do this.  Forget it.  No more L's.  Hey, Tom, is Wall Street affecting Main Street?  Wall Street.  This question's coming in right now.  Is affecting Main Street.  Yeah.  Which means that the problems that perk up on Wall Street will affect the common man.  Willie Cajoski.  All right.  I'm going to have a hard time making ends meet. 
[01:03:00]  Tom Brokaw looking like a wax figure.  What's your thoughts on Sarah Palin?  There's a big buzz on the Sarah Palin.  Oh, that's ****.  Can you even say Sarah Palin?  Sarah Pagan.  Sarah what?  Sarah Pagan.  Pagan.  She belongs to a motorcycle club here on New York.  The Pagan.  Sarah Pagan.  Sarah Pagan.  Let's go to Rich in Boston.  Rich? 
[01:03:30]  Hey, did you guys hear this morning when he was gone?  I just want to sing a little song for Sarah Palin's little child.  Yeah.  Down doobie, do down, down.  Oh, come on, come on, down doobie.  A little joke.  Yeah.  Very low, low, low, low, low.  What's up, Rich?  Did you hear Tom Brokaw told her, tell those guys to get out of his way because he couldn't  see the teleprompter?  Oh, yeah, right at the end.  Really?  What happened?  He was wrapping up.  Well, that wraps up our debate.  The second debate between these two candidates is going to get the hell out of my way. 
[01:04:00]  Really?  I can't see the word machine.  Don't try to even make me say teleponker.  Tenderponker.  Helicopter.  I'm reading off the helicopter.  Teletubby.  I don't have to read the teleprompter.  It was fun to see him trying to take charge.  He was bobbing and weaving.  They had a camera angle on him where the candidates were right in front of him.  Yeah.  We couldn't see what he was looking at, obviously, because the camera's on him, but he was looking 
[01:04:30]  at the teleprompter and he couldn't see it, so you just saw him bobbing and weaving,  trying to get his head between the candidates.  And then they brought out the wives.  And this Michelle Obama comes out.  Making that face.  This is where Ant and I are in total agreement, by the way.  Look, all I know about her is I'm not very fond of some of her friends, some of her past 
[01:05:00]  quotes, things like that.  But all that's just that they spin it.  They do whatever they want.  They say that was years ago.  Blah, blah, blah.  The one thing I hate about her is this face she makes.  She can smell like she stepped in crap.  Yes.  Well, she did.  Believe me, she stepped in it, being his wife.  She's going to be in the White House.  She's going to be first lady.  God.  First black lady. 
[01:05:30]  Well, I don't see color.  What?  I don't see color like that.  I only see white.  She's going to be first lady.  And she can't get mugged.  Get face.  She goes, me.  And I think it's one of those weird smiles, those upside down smiles people have sometimes.  There's people that smile and it's a frown.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, that's funny.  Mm-hmm.  Why are you crying?  They make lip mustaches?  Yeah. 
[01:06:00]  Well, where the bottom lip is smiling, the top lip is not.  She's got that.  There it is.  There's a bit.  That's just a bit of it.  Ugh.  I think her teeth are too big.  She's got like a George mouth.  Like an Ottawa George.  Her teeth are too big.  Her teeth are too big and she has to really try hard to close her mouth.  Teeth are too big.  Then they match her ass perfectly.  She came out in that dress.  First of all, she's got nothing up top.  And her ass is giant.  Nice.  No.  You don't like that?  No.  You don't like a nice big...  She was standing sideways, a profile, and that ass, Obama could have put his notes on 
[01:06:30]  it.  Just rest her night.  Don't need a podium.  It's better than McCain...  I'll be using my wife, Michelle, as a podium for this evening.  It's better than McCain's Stepford wife, that robot that somebody made in a basement.  She is a creepy, creepy woman.  I love him.  Yeah, she's creepy, dude.  I just really...  I don't like her more than I don't like Obama.  And he's, you know, the one that will be president.  I really think he's going to win, which is...  You know he's going to win.  They were, like, working the map last night on CNN going, McCain has to, like, win, like, 
[01:07:00]  five states at this point.  Nine.  He...  How many?  Nine.  Now it's up to nine.  He's got to turn around nine states.  Wow.  They're working the map.  He's like, well, if he wins Cleveland and holds on to Ohio and then takes Nevada, then  he still has to do this and this.  He's like, this is almost impossible at this point.  People are very appearance conscious in this country.  And presidents...  That's why most of the presidents we've had have had, you know, full heads of hair and  in recent history, anyway.  And have to be smooth talkers, have to walk, have a little swagger in their walk and stuff. 
[01:07:30]  McCain ain't it.  He's very old.  He's got the...  I don't know what pure white shade of white that hair is.  It is a weird color, man.  He uses, like, bleach and shoulders.  And they're...  It's...  They're boo.  It's not just white hair.  And they're putting some kind of, like, tanning spray on the top of his head?  Ugh.  It is.  It's a comb-over.  He's got the big rifle butt jaw going, which, you know, you can't blame him. 
[01:08:00]  Poor bastard's been beaten in a POW camp, but...  His back is...  His back is shattered.  It's like he's just lying on a board for five years.  I think they just...  Every day came in and individually took a hole punch and cracked each vertebrae one by  one on a daily basis.  And when they got to the tailbone, they started at the top again.  It's the only way.  He just stands straight up.  I don't know why he wants the gig.  72, he's been through it all. 
[01:08:30]  Relax.  You know?  Take some time off.  He's got that hot wife of his.  For a 72-year-old guy, that's a nice score.  But people don't want that.  They want somebody with, you know, some personality.  Some charisma.  And Obama's got that, but I don't think...  I really don't think he's going to make a good president.  And then people argue, well, Bush didn't make a good president.  All right.  Well, can we have...  You know, now we've got to go 12 years with a bad president.  At least you can take solace in the fact that the first black president has... 
[01:09:00]  It's the worst time to become president.  There's nothing good...  Oh, you think this is going to ruin it for black people as far as that goes?  The next four years are going to be a nightmare for whoever's in office.  The financial crisis, that's not an easy fix.  Everyone's looking for the easy fix.  That's going to be a long haul.  Well, he's going to tax the crap out of everybody.  He's saying 95% of the people get tax breaks, my friend.  Yeah, you know who doesn't?  It's the 5% which we're in.  But it's not even...  I'm not even taking this personally. 
[01:09:30]  I'm talking about businesses.  Even small business.  He says it ain't going to affect the small businesses.  It absolutely is.  Because most of those guys don't make 250 Gs.  Yes, they do.  The cutoff is 250, he says.  Yes, they do.  He's saying it doesn't.  Small businesses can't survive unless they're making over a couple of hundred thousand a year.  They got employees to pay, perhaps.  I'm not talking about a mom-and-pop business run on the internet out of their home.  I'm talking storefront businesses.  People that got to pay rent.  People that have to pay employees and electric bills, fuel bills. 
[01:10:00]  They have to make money.  They can't afford to be hit with these taxes where they're just going to have to...  You know what they're going to do?  They're going to go, okay, my taxes are higher.  You, I'm sorry, you're fired.  Unemployment goes up.  Where's this poor bastard going to go and get another job now?  No one's going to be hiring because he's going to tax the crap out of anybody that's making any money.  Even small business.  I think the average small businessman doesn't make 250 Gs, though.  They absolutely do.  I need to figure that out.  Absolutely they do. 
[01:10:30]  Because mine is based on my brother.  He's got that fine restaurant in Huntington.  I'm not going for the plug, but what I'm trying to say is the restaurant does really, really well.  Well, he's not making 250.  He's not even close to making 250.  And what is the 250 based on?  Are you talking about personal income?  Well, that's what I need to know.  Personal income or business tax?  Well, that's what I need to know.  What is the 250 based on?  Is it after you pay all your bills and your employees and the health insurance or is it the gross?  I'm serious. 
[01:11:00]  That's important.  The devil is in the details here.  He says he's going to let the Bush tax cuts expire, which essentially is increasing the tax on almost everybody in the country.  But that's what we all need to know.  What is the 250 based on?  Is that what you finally bring home after you pay all your bills?  No, no, no, no.  Then it is.  Then it is.  It works like your taxes.  When when you have your taxes done, you have certain deductions you can make.  Right.  And then you have your taxable income.  Right.  I assume it's your taxable income, which absolutely is going to be over 200,000 for a small business. 
[01:11:30]  Yeah.  If you're personally incorporated, then you are the company.  And a lot of people file those those returns as a personal corporation.  And if you bring in over 250 and you're paying people out of that, whether you're paying them as contract laborers or whatever.  Yeah.  Half of those people are going to get a tax income.  All right.  Let me go to those companies.  Let's go to a small business owner, Carmine from New York.  How are you, Carmine?  Good morning, boys.  Good morning.  Anthony and Anthony are absolutely right.  I'm a small business owner. 
[01:12:00]  I own a contract commercial floor covering company.  OK.  And what Obama and the Democrats are saying would actually almost put me out of business.  So I have 14 people working for me.  And if those tax increases did go through, I'd probably have to let a bunch of them go.  I'd have to start doing more of the physical work myself, which would not allow me to go out and develop new work.  Yeah.  And one other thing I'm going to point out that how the Obama is always talking about redistribution of wealth. 
[01:12:30]  You know, in one year, even with their income, they gave out $65,000.  $40,000 of it went to Reverend Wright's church.  Another $15,000 or so went to the Black Caucus of America.  And $5,000 went to a black dance troupe.  What dance troupe?  Who knows?  The Zimbabwe.  I'm kidding.  All right.  Thank you.  Let me go to Bill in Connecticut because now he's saying the opposite.  Bill.  Yeah, what's up?  Hello, Bill. 
[01:13:00]  What's going on?  What's up, Bill?  Hey, Ant, you're wrong.  I'm wrong.  Well, I was just right.  Damn it.  The show turns on you.  A bunch of – we really need –  What's the problem?  The – even if we make $250,000, which we probably do, we don't even show it.  We do it.  You know, we get write-offs, whatever we do.  Yeah, if you shuffle around some stuff, but you're not supposed to do that.  I mean, they're a legitimate – no, no, let me tell you something.  All that money goes – go ahead. 
[01:13:30]  There are legitimate deductions you can make, but I'm not even – okay, I'm not even talking  small businesses that make under that much, even after they do their deductions.  Talk about any business that after their deductions, it comes out their taxable income is still  over $200,000.  That's a lot of businesses employing a lot of people that are going to be hurt.  Well, that's medium-sized companies, though.  No, they're –  No small company makes –  I'd say small to medium.  I'd say small to medium. 
[01:14:00]  Mom and pops running out of their home, that's a different story.  But small to medium businesses are going to be screwed, and that's who's employing most  of the people.  Right.  All right, let's go to Dave in New York.  He's a small business owner.  Dave, we're trying to get to the bottom of this.  What's up?  What's going on, fellas?  Hey.  You know, a lot of stuff scared me about what he was saying, also.  I don't know if you guys caught – if you guys caught the whole benefits package thing.  Basically, if you're a small business owner, you're going to get taxed if you don't offer  health, if you don't offer benefits to your – not tax, sorry, penalized by Obama's plan. 
[01:14:30]  Yeah, you'll be penalized.  What people have to understand is that when a small business' taxes get increased, I'm  not going to be paying that.  It's going to be my customer.  I'm going to hand over that tax straight over to my customer, and I'm not going to  feel it.  It's going to be you.  No one sits there and goes, oh, crap, I'm making less money because I'm paying taxes.  Oh, well, you figure out a way to make that money back, and it's usually at the expense 
[01:15:00]  of your employees or the customers, if you're in a sales business like that.  Your customers are going to be paying it, so the price of everything goes up.  This idiot doesn't understand, and most Democrats don't.  I'm sorry.  It's the way it is.  They don't understand.  You can't tax the crap out of the people that are paying everyone else.  It doesn't make any sense whatsoever.  No.  $250,000, it's not rich.  I mean, my business is a very small business, and that is just – and $250,000, 
[01:15:30]  is probably about half of what we do.  I'll have to let Keith go and do my own laundry.  Oh, no.  I can't have it.  All right, thank you.  I mean, the phones – we'll continue.  We're late for a break.  Chris, a girl from New Hampshire, owned a bakery, never came close to $100,000.  All right, well, she's a girl, and it's a bakery.  Shut up.  Yeah.  You can't make –  Of course.  Are you going to have $100,000 in cookies?  Get out of here.  Don't forget New Hampshire.  Yes.  New Hampshire cookie shop.  I own a New Hampshire cookie shop. 
[01:16:00]  Watch it.  Boy, the line is three people long today.  We got Tom Brokaw saying situation.  We'll get into that after the break.  We got to take advantage of the fact that Tom Brokaw is back in the news.  Anthony's been sitting on that impression for years.  I love Tom Brokaw.  That's right.  More with Tom Brokaw and Robert Kelly after the break.  Opie and Anthony trying to shove food down. 
[01:16:30]  We got to eat.  Robert Kelly is sitting in for Jim Norton today.  Norton's going to be on Chelsea Handler on E.  And then I think he's doing Carson Daly as well, right?  Very cool.  Really?  Carson Daly?  Yeah.  Why would he do that show?  The Jim Norton tour.  Let's show it.  They have no warm-up.  They literally make you sit there and wait and through his fascinating interviewing skills. 
[01:17:00]  I think he's doing it.  Sitting down?  Just so he can say, yeah, oh, I did Carson.  Like, you know, maybe they'll think it's the old days.  Yeah, my credits, Leno, Letterman.  I did Carson.  Like, oh, wow.  That must have been very young and early in your career.  Have you tried sitting through Carson Daly?  Let me tell you something.  No.  The first time I did it, I was at the cellar reading the prompt, the closed caption, and 
[01:17:30]  the first joke, it said, he wrote, light laughter.  Oh, really?  Oh, that's bad.  Thank you.  God, you could fake it on the, really?  Nah.  Even the closed caption guy was like, ugh.  Uproarious laughter.  Yeah.  What a cold one.  They put you right out there.  Yeah.  He did this interview with some actor.  I literally was like, oh, my God.  Then they throw you out there.  He's very bad at interviewing.  That's one thing I noticed watching him.  He's very uncomfortable. 
[01:18:00]  Yeah.  He doesn't really ask good questions.  No good follow-ups.  Yeah, it just goes on and on forever.  Yeah.  It's like listening to somebody on the train that haven't seen each other in like 20 years.  Hey, what's going on?  Nothing.  How you doing?  Good.  How you doing?  Good.  Click.  Channels change.  They love him, though.  He extended his contract and everything.  He's on at four in the morning.  Who wouldn't love him?  Yeah.  Him and Byron Allen.  Hey, so Norton was on Leno last night.  Why don't we take a peek and see what Jimmy was doing last night on Leno? 
[01:18:30]  A peek with our ears?  Yeah, a little peek with our ears.  Right?  I'm seeing somebody now who's a little younger than me, and it's really weird, because you  know how it is like the first few months of a new relationship?  There's a getting to know each other, and there's like a month and a half of complete  sexual dysfunction.  All right.  All right, good.  Am I the only one that's ever lost?  It's amazing when you lose it.  Like, every guy has fear in bed, and we don't talk about being afraid sexually.  Women, you always, you never think that we're afraid, or we're tense, or we're not in 
[01:19:00]  the mood.  Women always blame themselves when you can't get it up.  But, you know, you lose it, and they never go, what's the matter, are you okay?  They're always like, what's wrong with me?  And usually, you're like, eh, it's not you.  It's cloudy.  Although, yeah, sometimes it's fine.  It's like, what's wrong with me?  Well, your face is a bit of a distraction. 
[01:19:30]  I thought I could work with it, but I'm going to continue to struggle if you insist on looking  in my direction.  I'm still working on cloudy.  Cloudy.  Cloudy?  Do you have a solar-powered penis?  I certainly hope so.  I'm always showing it outdoors.  Ah-ha.  Ah-ha, Bill.  Jimmy get the last good one. 
[01:20:00]  Bill Maher trying to, like, trump Jimmy, and then Jimmy goes, pooh!  Sit on the couch and shut up!  Right.  Let Jimmy shine!  It's my time, not yours!  You big, far-headed douche!  You atheist!  I'm still working on cloudy.  It didn't make sense.  I didn't get it.  Yeah, shut up.  I'm still working on cloudy.  Shut up!  Bill Maher does seem like the type of guy that needs to have the biggest laugh in the world.  Oh, he needs the attention.  He needs it, right?  Sit on the couch.  You had your segment.  Let Jimmy shine, dummy. 
[01:20:30]  There you go.  Jimmy got killing on Leno last night.  Eight.  Oh, look at little Anthony protecting his little buddy.  Oh, yeah.  I love little Jimmy.  It was obvious what Bill Maher was trying to do there.  Yeah, Bill Maher's a little, tiny, squirmy dude, too.  He's like four foot two.  Really?  Giant forehead.  Jimmy's getting all these laughs, and Bill Maher was uncomfortable with that.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  Well, I'll show everybody who the real comedian is here.  Yeah.  What a great line.  I hope so.  I'm usually doing it outside.  Pervert. 
[01:21:00]  He really is a true pervert.  He just slipped into society.  All right.  Listen.  Yeah.  Somehow he just keeps slipping through the cracks of the legal system.  I really don't know how he does it.  He should not be on, like, network TV.  No.  On prime time, like, at all.  No.  You're absolutely right.  There's no way that physically, physically, he shouldn't be on TV at all.  Like, physically.  He does not have one requirement for TV. 
[01:21:30]  Hair, face, chin, nothing.  Eyes are too round and buggy.  His ears are lumpy.  His eyebrows are wispy.  Wow.  You know what I mean?  But he just pulls it off.  And then he goes on TV, and his act is just thoroughly.  He's just despicable.  Yeah.  It's disturbing.  If you really would have broken down piece by piece.  He's a horrendous guy.  And yet, there's something that people find him charming.  He just turns to me.  What is that?  Because he does it with a smile.  He does it with almost like a wink.  So did Son of Sam. 
[01:22:00]  I'm sure he was smiling when he was pulling the trigger.  But, Jesus.  Yeah, he really just snuck in.  God bless him.  God bless him.  Steven S. from Bayshore writes, Jimmy plus Leno equals one normal-sized chin.  Oh, there you go.  We brought it to your attention, so now we have to play it.  Tom Brokaw, during the debate last night, attempting the word situation.  Senator Obama, let me ask you, let's see if we can establish tonight the Obama doctrine  and the McCain doctrine for the use of United States combat forces in situations where 
[01:22:30]  there's a humanitarian crisis, but it does not affect our national security.  You know what he does?  He saves air to push out words that he can't say.  Situation.  Right.  Bless you, Tom.  Right.  I thought you sneezed when you said situation.  Actuation.  The McCain doctrine.  What is it?  That's the buzzword of this.  Well, because you had to push it.  The doctrine.  Well, the Bush doctrine.  I want an Anthony doctrine. 
[01:23:00]  What's the Anthony doctrine?  Well, can't say it on the air, I guess.  Yeah.  All right.  I think everyone out there knows what your doctrine is.  I answered my own question.  I know what it is.  Okay.  I know what my doctrine is.  And then Tom Brokaw telling the guys to get out of the way because he wanted to see  the reading.  Yeah, please.  That concludes tonight's debate from here in Nashville.  We want to thank our hosts here at Belmont University in Nashville and the Commission  on Presidential Debates.  And you're in my way of my script there, if you will move.  In addition to everything else, there is one more presidential debate on... 
[01:23:30]  Michelle Obama's fat ass is in my way.  Could you move...  Barack, could you move your wife's huge, fat, bulbous ass out of the way of my telepronation?  He had the easy job.  You really needed the reading machine at that point?  Yeah, you're just saying goodbye.  Just wrap up the dumb debate.  Take it easy.  I don't need the words.  Okay.  Later.  Right.  I'm leaving. 
[01:24:00]  Oh, boy.  That ass.  Stump Brain brought up the fact that Michelle Obama had a zipper on the back of her dress.  You know how most dresses women wear?  When they go, zip me up, please.  You go, wow, this thing is a flimsy little zipper.  It's not even a zipper-like thing that you pull on.  It's this little twig that sticks out.  And you kind of zip them up like that.  She had a zipper that you only see on sails. 
[01:24:30]  Yeah, she had one.  Like on boat sails, zippers.  She was wearing a wetsuit?  Yeah, like a wetsuit zipper.  It's just this big.  The thing was like two inches wide running down her back to hold in that abutah.  You know there was some lady backstage with some kind of like coat hanger apparatus to zip the zipper up.  This guy, he says, a zipper looked like a tank tread. 
[01:25:00]  Like a zipper on a body bag.  Imagine what's going to fall out if you unzip that thing.  Oh, my God.  I can only imagine.  What is the first night?  Now, you've got to understand, a first black president, black first lady, they're in the White House.  What do you think that's going to be like as far as getting it on?  We've got to get a little Al Green or something.  Do you think it's in the main bedroom or the Lincoln bedroom? 
[01:25:30]  Do you do it in like the Lincoln bedroom?  All of them.  Just all around the house?  Secret Service running around, pulling their hair out?  Oval Office.  We don't know where they are.  Oh, yeah.  Oval Office.  Yeah.  Right there on the desk.  Get that Clinton stank out of that place.  Oh, yeah.  That's what you've got to do.  You've got to clean that room up first.  We've lost them somewhere in the hallway.  We've lost...  Oh, okay.  No, it's fine.  He's doing the pile driver here.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No, that was after the wheelbarrow. 
[01:26:00]  They did the wheelbarrow in the Lincoln bedroom.  Now, they're in the hallway doing the pile driver.  Secret Service is running around, holding their ear.  They can't figure out where the hell they are.  Are they having sex?  Just picturing any of these people having sex is kind of disturbing.  You know what?  I was thinking this the other day.  A lot of guests get to stay in the Lincoln bedroom.  That's kind of where, when you're invited to the White House, you stay in the Lincoln  bedroom.  Right. 
[01:26:30]  Who really wants to stay in there when you really think about it?  Because you know you're just having sex in there.  If I was staying in the Lincoln bedroom, I'm at least, even if I'm alone, I'm having  sex.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  It's like, you got to just have the story.  Oh, absolutely.  That you did this in the Lincoln bedroom.  So you, your chick, you're in there, whatever.  But that's just it.  Then, because I was thinking the same thing.  There's surveillance everywhere.  You don't think there's cameras?  They probably have stacks of great tapes, of video, of just celebrities, dignitaries, 
[01:27:00]  movie stars, just politicians, just banging away in the Lincoln bedroom.  They probably have like a video of Barbra Streisand, you know, getting the booyah.  The booyah.  The booyah.  The booyah.  From Mr. Barbra Streisand.  Wouldn't you love to know that crap, the behind the scenes stuff?  You know there's some dude at the White House that has stories that he can never tell.  Yeah.  Oh, we got tapes.  So we got some hidden cameras in this joint. 
[01:27:30]  They got it.  It's the White House.  I can't wait until they have their first fight.  She starts breaking, like, you know, just taking, like, photos off the wall and faces  from doing that head back and forth stuff.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, Mr. President?  Like, she'll hold that over his head, that he's the president.  You might be the president of the United States.  You ain't the president of me.  You ain't the president of me.  And she just gets all nasty on his ass.  She grabs a vase from China that was given to, like, just smashes it. 
[01:28:00]  Given to Nixon from his trip to China.  Right.  Just smashes against the wall.  She's grabbing Kennedy pictures and just winging them.  Little John John saluting.  You ain't Kennedy.  Yeah.  You ain't no Kennedy.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  And I ain't no Jackie O.  Yeah.  No respect for the stuff in the White House.  Yeah.  No respect whatsoever.  See, the kids' names are carved in the desk.  Right.  Oh, God, no. 
[01:28:30]  Oh, yeah.  I'll tell you, that track, that running track's gone.  Hoops.  Don't need that.  Hoops.  Hoops in there.  Big Jordan with a big J in the middle.  Just taking valuable, like, documents and smashing them over his head.  Just smashing stuff because she's PO'd.  Right.  She's all annoyed.  Yeah, the Constitution.  I saw that.  Who was that?  I saw you.  You'd look into a girl's eyes a little long when you were shaking hands outside.  Baby, it's, you know, I'm the president.  I got to shake hands and this and that. 
[01:29:00]  Not like that.  I saw you looking.  Crash.  There goes the Constitution.  Crap.  Oh, that's funny.  Yeah, that's going to be rough.  I'm with you on that one.  President of me.  There's something about her.  We haven't seen the real Michelle Obama yet.  She's on her best behavior.  She has shown it, definitely.  But I think it gets a lot worse than what she's shown the American part.  Oh, yeah.  Just a few times when they were interviewed together and you see Obama kind of get nervous,  like, I'll take care of this. 
[01:29:30]  I'm going to.  Shut up.  What was the last question?  What don't you know and where are you going to learn it?  And where are you going to learn it?  And what did he say?  I'm going to learn it from Michelle.  Ugh.  Ugh.  Ugh.  Well, sometimes you learn stuff from your wife.  Oh, stop it.  I'm talking to Opie, not you, Mr. Solo.  Sorry.  Me and Opie are on the same page almost now.  It's not quite there yet.  I'm getting there.  But, uh.  Are you in love? 
[01:30:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Do you like being in love?  I'm not even going to front it.  We've been together, Bob, we've been together 13 years, of course.  Not you two.  Oh, damn it.  I thought you were talking about our illustrious radio career.  Illustrious.  No, we love each other.  Trust me.  We got to buy some fine things because of love for each other.  Every time my mortgage payment goes out, I'm in love again.  Oh, yeah.  You know, just when I think I want to hate Anthony, that's exactly what happens.  Oh, no.  I love him.  Oh, come here.  Exciting and new. 
[01:30:30]  Oh, come here, you daffy bastard.  If you had to choose, who would you choose?  You got to make a choice?  Yeah, between Anthony or Lindsey.  They're in the water, and there's a shark coming.  Right.  And you can only pull one out into the boat.  That's why I hate those dumb books and games.  I'm not even answering the question.  All right.  If you could only eat one food for the rest of your life, what would it be?  That's the best part about being a guy is that we can make a game up with rules in 10 seconds,  and it will be passed on from generation to generation. 
[01:31:00]  All right.  You get a piece of tinfoil, all right?  It's all serious.  Yeah, exactly.  No.  No, man.  No.  No.  The rule, you said it earlier.  All right.  All right.  You get all mad.  All right.  It's the rule from now on.  If the tinfoil hits your face, then it's out of bounds.  But if it hits down below, anything down below, it's good.  All right.  But those are the rules now.  Those are the rules from now on.  That's it.  Okay.  That's it.  All right.  You're up.  Oh, wait, wait.  One more, one more, one more.  All right.  What?  All right.  Now, listen.  Yeah.  Should it be three throws or two? 
[01:31:30]  Because three, it's getting a little long.  Two, you're right.  You're two.  All right.  We'll go with two throws.  All right.  That's the rule now.  That's it.  Two.  All right.  I go first.  Grab me another beer.  All right.  Cool.  Hang on.  All right.  Listen, we've got to take a break.  We have a PTG that features you, Bobby.  Oh.  Yeah.  Our little gossip thing.  It's kind of our takeoff on the whole TMZ thing.  Sam does them.  I want Sam to sing me happy birthday in a sexy voice.  We could do that.  I think we could do that.  In a very sexy voice.  We could do that before the show ends.  But first, a PTG featuring the birthday boy, Robert Kelly.  I don't know what this is about, but Sam said it's about you this time. 
[01:32:00]  You're back, and with all the controversial statements Opie from radio's The Opie and Anthony  Show has been making, the PTG team is having to give up sleep just to report all the news.  Opie went on the show recently, and with Jim out of town, made a statement so impactful  it nearly shook the ground.  When Norton's not here, Patrice is probably my favorite villain, I've got to say.  Forgetting every other comedian who has ever come on the show, Opie placed Patrice on 
[01:32:30]  a pedestal, leaving a mass grave filled with the hopes and dreams of dozens of hopeful  funny men.  You have access to a lot of young gentlemen.  Just accept the compliment.  I accept it, but you know, now you've got to deal with Bobby and Fox.  Well, Bobby's going to be in tomorrow, and the guys we have in filling for Jim, we like  them all.  Like them all, huh?  Sure you do.  Just not quite as much as the golden boy, Patrice O'Neal.  Our sources say that Opie regretted his comments immediately, as he, quote, didn't mean  Patrice was better than everyone. 
[01:33:00]  Mainly just Bob Kelly.  How will stupid Bob Kelly respond?  Stay tuned, as primetime gossip puts you in the know.  That was taken out of context.  It really was.  I actually have to totally agree with you.  He's my favorite, too.  And I think Voss is actually before me, just because he's a moron, and he's more interesting  to listen to that car crash.  I am very mediocre when I fill in.  But I do the job, God.  No, you do great, Bobby.  Now it's just awkward, because I did say that yesterday, and you're here, and I was hoping 
[01:33:30]  that no one was going to point that out.  You like the black guy.  You like the black guy.  You like the black funny.  Patrice is one of the funniest guys I know.  You know, you see he's actually becoming a star.  You know, he's getting up there, and you see a little coattail you can snag onto.  So, yeah, I get it.  Give a little tug on that coattail.  Hold on.  Hold on tight, Ope.  Thanks, Sam.  Hold on tight.  Thanks for putting me in the spot today.  That's good.  Hey, have you been following Jacktober, Bobby? 
[01:34:00]  Have you been listening to the show when you're not here?  Yeah, I have been.  I'm pal-talking, which is awkward.  Okay.  We're at a crossroads with our Jacktober bit, but Sam's saying we've got to check out Married  with Microphones.  Married with Microphones is a show?  Yeah.  Well, we could do that.  The name alone makes me just cringe.  We're late for a break, so are we going to do Married with Microphones today for Jacktober?  I want to do it right when we come back. 
[01:34:30]  No shenanigans.  What is our thing that we call it?  Lockdown.  Let's lockdown.  You're calling for a lockdown?  I'm calling for a lockdown because I want to do Jacktober.  I got to hear Married with Microphones.  Married with Microphones.  Ugh.  All right.  We're in the lockdown mode.  I'd rather hear Married in Modesto.  Don't fight it.  People just know we're in lockdown.  We don't need the big over-the-top lockdown clip.  Don't worry about it.  Hang on.  Did you guys see my new training? 
[01:35:00]  It's an opium, Anthony.  Lockdown.  Shut up.  You can't talk now.  No new subject.  We're locked down.  We're locked down, Bobby.  What are you...  Married with Microphones.  We're locking down.  It's an opium, Anthony.  Lockdown.  We're not even acknowledging that you're petting Sam's hair.  I'm sorry.  We're in lockdown, Bobby.  Look.  We're locking all the doors right now.  Now we're going down to the basement.  Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.  Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba 
[01:35:30]  Locked down.  We were going to do Married with Microphones.  What? 
[01:36:00]  What are you talking about?  That's the, you know, because of Jocktober.  What's Jocktober?  See, most stations do Rocktober.  Ah.  And we're sick of it, sick of hearing about it.  So we do Jocktober where we feature some lame radio show from around the country and call it Jocktober.  And we do this to make ourselves feel very good about ourselves.  Feel good about ourselves.  At least we'll acknowledge that.  See, after you hear a Jocktober entry, we could be really crappy and still feel kind of good. 
[01:36:30]  What it does is it allows the O&A community to go, you know what?  The guys aren't that bad after all.  Yeah.  And it's always better to laugh at somebody that isn't as good at something as you are.  That's right.  Can I just say this?  As a comedian, and you know we have to go on the road and we have to go and do radio.  Oh, and do other radio shows.  We have to promote our gigs.  Yeah.  Let me tell you something.  Every time you go on a show, every time you're calling, you're waiting.  It's like, hey, how you doing, Robert?  And you're waiting for that. 
[01:37:00]  So you're on O&A, huh?  You're on that one where they did the Jocktober bit about us, were you?  Yeah.  Heard you chiming in.  You'll hear me get very quiet.  I don't play Cincinnati.  I don't think you're going to go on Married with Microphone.  Yeah.  So you're all in on this one.  You're fine.  I love that you guys just threw me in.  Okay, guys.  Yeah.  You're all in.  Take the muzzle off.  Here we go.  So it's a show called Married with Microphones.  But first, the official Jocktober sweeper, which changes every day, which I like.  The boys are working in the back office. 
[01:37:30]  Happy Jocktober, everybody, from your friends at the Open Academy Show.  I want to rock!  It's a celebration of hacky, pukey radio shows and DJs from across this great nation of ours.  Be aware out there today, there seems to be something in the air besides the fall weather here.  Oh, my God.  Would you just kill yourself?  I would go home and just swallow a shotgun.  Strike up the crapola.  It's Jocktober.  There's a person stranded.  There's a show. 
[01:38:00]  There's a show.  It's stranded.  I love that.  I think that's funny.  That is funny.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  What the hell was that?  Happy Jocktober, everybody, from your friends at the Open Academy Show.  Ha, ha.  Let's all do it.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  It was no joy.  It has to be a sound of not.  Yeah.  There it is.  The official sweeper for Jocktober.  And today we feature this Married with Microphones with Chris and Janine and some newswoman. 
[01:38:30]  They're out of Cincinnati.  Their slogan is Cincinnati's Greatest Hits, everybody.  Go to WGRR.com if you want to make fun with us.  Oh, by the way, your boy's right on the front page.  Dane Cook, so.  Let's not expect one word out of Bob.  Well, Chris and Janine.  Chris and Janine. 
[01:39:00]  Now, they're doing something a little different because there's a lot of morning shows out there that have the man and the woman.  And they kind of make believe that they're married.  They kind of have this weird, like, they're married relationship, but they're not married.  But they're not.  In this case, these two are married, hence, married with microphones.  Right.  Because they also have microphones.  Well, it's a radio show, I guess.  Yes, it is.  The microphones are probably very handy and very necessary.  By the way, W-G-R-R or W-G-R. 
[01:39:30]  G-R-R.  G-R-R.  A-G-R-R.  Oh, they got Pete Rose on the show.  That's pretty cool.  Hell, man, they get better guests than us.  Yeah, look at this.  What the hell is this?  It's a cavalcade of fine guests.  I wonder why.  I listened to yesterday's show.  Whoa, what happened?  Oh.  Yeah, you guys are fantastic.  Excuse us while we leave.  The only reason we're not talking about that today, because we want to do that bit again.  Yeah.  Because everyone's like, why aren't you talking about that today?  Because, you know what, we got to kind of not talk about some stuff so we can do it again. 
[01:40:00]  Right.  But it was a lot of fun.  Sam was great as Anthony.  Oh, what are you talking about?  I'm sorry.  Right.  All right.  All right.  We're experimenting with franchising the Opie and Anthony show out, so there could be many  Opie and Anthony's, and we sit home and just collect the dough.  That's what the Burger King or McDonald's guy did, right?  He didn't have to make any burgers after a while. 
[01:40:30]  He wasn't running off to every city flipping burgers.  He got other people to do it for him.  That's right.  That's what we do now.  Colonel Sanders, you think he was actually throwing that chicken in the deep fryer?  No matter which Kentucky Fried you went to, Colonel Sanders was there going, all right,  what's your order?  No, he gets other people to do it.  Maybe in the beginning.  It's still Kentucky Fried.  It's still his picture on the thing, but not so much work for him.  That's what we're, that's our goal now.  That's our goal.  That's our new goal.  Just find Opie and Anthony's and just distribute them around small markets, whatever. 
[01:41:00]  Doesn't matter.  We're not going to go there.  We don't care.  Maybe we'll show up every once in a while.  We'll show up for the grand opening.  Grand opening, you've got to be there to cut the ribbon.  We'll be there for the first show, and then we're like, all right, you're on, you're on.  All right, we're very happy.  We're going to have to bring you the Opie and Anthony show.  Right.  And then we leave, and here's the recipes.  Opie and Anthony show.  You got your Whip-Em-Out Wednesday.  You got, what's some of those other bits we got?  Jocktober.  Jocktober.  Jocktober.  Voyeur bus.  We got sex in a church. 
[01:41:30]  55-gatton drums.  Dude.  What?  55-gatton drums.  Jewish boys.  They play pretty good on the radio.  Homeless shopping.  Homeless shopping.  Tipper Tom.  Eggnog drinking challenge.  Guay woof.  Baby bird.  Stalker Patty.  Stalker Patty.  Yeah, and we'll franchise them, too.  Each Opie and Anthony franchise will get their own stalker.  We'll change the names a little bit.  Yeah.  All right, here we go. 
[01:42:00]  We meet Married with Microphones.  This is their sweeper?  Yeah, just in case, like, maybe you think this might be a nickname or something I made  up as far as the show title goes.  I just wanted some audio evidence that that's really the name of the program.  And you're working on, like, the top ten worst...  Names.  Yeah, morning show names.  Okay, good.  Acknowledging the Opie and Anthony is not the best name in the biz, but...  Yeah, but it's better than Tom and...  It's based on my dumb nickname before I had, you know, the hormones screaming through my 
[01:42:30]  body, so I didn't care.  It's better than Tom and the Pop-Tarts.  Yeah.  Then I hit puberty.  I'm like, why am I stuck with this stupid name?  It was fun when I was, like, 12 and didn't give a crap about girls or anything yet.  I still like it.  They definitely have the same thing, the Greg and Anthony show.  Huh?  That stinks.  Opie's a good one.  Oh, it's wonderful, Bob.  Even though Anthony.  Oh, it's wonderful, Bob.  Yeah, try living with that name.  All right, here we go.  The Married with Microphone Sweeper.  I wonder what mom came up with for this week's Family Wednesday. 
[01:43:00]  103.5.  Married with Microphone.  W-T-R-R.  Wow, that's energetic, though.  That's the morning show, right?  Yeah.  That wakes you up.  That'll wake you up.  That'll wake you up.  That's a waker-upper right there.  Yeah.  That's an attention-getter.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  They bought into the jingle package, I see.  Da-da-da-da-da-da.  Yeah.  Stunt brain knows.  All right, you want the-  Jingle package.  All right, you guys want the jingle package?  You want the deep voice guy? 
[01:43:30]  Yeah.  What do you need?  What do you need?  Yeah.  All right.  The married couple crack very cute jokes about hoodies.  Ooh.  Yeah, just like, you know-  I like hoodies.  Yeah, and married couples, when they get together and start making jokes, it's just cute.  It's a good show.  Samson, dude.  Hey.  Rain coming down.  We need that.  67 for the high.  It's 61 degrees now.  I'm all wet, though.  You know, I had to stop and get the papers here. 
[01:44:00]  We also should talk about what morning shows do to, like, kill time, because they can't  really talk about anything.  Mm-hmm.  Like, if you're doing weather on your show, you suck.  If you say stuff like, we need the rain, you suck.  You have nothing.  What else?  What's some of those other things they do?  Horoscopes, you suck.  Birthday.  Birthday.  Birthday shout-outs.  Just day in history.  Yeah, all that stuff is- it's called filler, because, you know, the people you hired have nothing.  Yeah.  Rain coming down. 
[01:44:30]  We need that.  Do we?  67 for the high.  It's 61 degrees now.  I'm all wet, though.  You know, I had to stop and get the papers here downtown, and, oh, you know, I never  have an umbrella.  Poor thing.  I mean, I knew all day yesterday it was going to rain today, and I never managed to have  an umbrella, but I did have a hoodie in my car with a hood.  That's good, a hoodie with a hood.  Yeah, well, you know, sometimes those hoods are missing.  So, you know, the hoodie's all wet.  You've unzipped them and left it somewhere.  Left the hoodie.  You know me too well. 
[01:45:00]  I can't find my hoodie.  What?  Why the laughter?  That's my favorite part, by the way, the laughter out of nowhere, and then you, like, try to  break it down.  Like, she's laughing uncontrollably because sometimes you do what?  Why would they call it a hoodie if it didn't have a hood?  It didn't have a hood.  Oh, my God.  Oh.  What?  That is banter.  Yeah.  That is meant for their marriage.  Like, she would get home and go, oh, I went out. 
[01:45:30]  It was raining.  Picture them without the microphones.  Yeah.  Just married.  Right.  And they're home.  This is the inane conversation.  And the guy has to react by going, oh, really?  But meanwhile, he'd be sitting there going, shut up.  Yeah.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Because she's just talking about, and I didn't have an umbrella.  So I went out, and I got a hoodie.  And the guy's just like, I just want to.  This is what the guy's hearing.  Watch TV or...  Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.  But that's the beauty of the show.  Instead of the woman telling one person a story that he doesn't care about, she's telling a 
[01:46:00]  whole radio audience a story.  Oh, we get it, Sam.  It's great.  We get it.  See, this works because there's married people listening to the show, so they can relate to  the married people on the radio.  Let's say hi to Patrick  Patrick  Hey guys, what's up?  I just wanted to suggest the Jennifer and Anthony show  Maybe they could lose their FTC license within the first five minutes  Yeah, that would be a good one, huh?  That's a show I would listen to  I mean, it would suck for you, Anthony 
[01:46:30]  Divorced with microphones, they could call  And then we get on there  And you don't hear us at all  You just hear lawyers talk  Because you're not actually allowed to talk to each other  And hammered out  So it would be lawyers talking to each other  As I sit there and clench my teeth  And drink excessively  Yeah  We should do Divorced with microphones  Divorced with microphones  Is there a couple out there willing to do Divorced with microphones?  And not that friendly friggin'  We got a divorce and everything's dandy couple  No  We want sheer hatred 
[01:47:00]  Yeah  Between the two of you  Ooh, that would be great  See, mine would be perfect  Oh, yeah  Mine would be  Actually, me and any ex would be perfect  To tell you the truth  Oof  I am the old bridge burner  When it comes to relationships  Leave him on the other side  He really had to end it  Oh, yeah  You know  I'm like Indy on that bridge with the machete  Here it is, honey  Whack  You know, if we got the last one in here  I know you would hate it 
[01:47:30]  But the ratings would be  Yeah, they certainly would  All the other morning shows would have to shut down  They would have to shut down  Yeah, that'd be a biggie  Hey, Fast Freddy writes  You know me too well  That was something the guy said, I guess  Yeah  And Fast Freddy writes  You know me too well  No S  You're his effing wife  It's your wife  Yeah  Let's say hi to Eric in Indiana  I love how we break this down  And get very picky  Go ahead, Eric  Hey, guys  Yeah, I just wanted to point out 
[01:48:00]  That she's saying that they travel to work separately  But they're married  Like, wouldn't she know if she didn't have an umbrella?  Why would she have to read that story?  Yeah, do they drive in separately?  Right  They're married  Wouldn't they be in the same vehicle?  Yeah, but you know they were in the car  And she started ranting  And he went, save it, save it  Save it for the radio  Oh, this is good stuff  The hoodie, the umbrella  This is good stuff  Then she kept talking  No, no, no  Shut up  Save it for the air  This is great  This is good stuff  Don't forget about the  Don't forget the galoshes bit 
[01:48:30]  We're going to get into later  Here's today's observation  Because no one else has figured this one out  There is something wrong with line two  That needs to be fixed immediately  And there's a low-level home  That's been happening  You know  In our headphones for the last five or six days  Let's fix some of this stuff around  You know what?  Hearing that hum  I didn't hear it  We're supposed to be  Until now  Until now  And now it's going to aggravate me  And my mic gates out  When I'm not talking into it  And then  When I go to talk  It kind of kicks back in 
[01:49:00]  What's gates out?  It just like  Goes  Shuts off pretty much  It's probably a uni  And we need an omni  Yeah, and then it comes back on louder  Processing's messed up  And the processing's messed up  And everything sucks  How do you intend on fixing the studio  Now that you've fired everybody?  That's the question we pose to you  CBS management  First, for the first minute of this  We go to Greg Hughes  How would you fix it? 
[01:49:30]  With the hammer  They've given me a hammer  Yeah, we said this earlier  Anthony, they gave him an actual hammer  To fix his equipment today  I'm not even kidding  For those of you on PalTalk  You can see I'm holding a hammer  Yeah  A claw hammer  Yeah  That I have to use occasionally  To hit my microphone  To get it to work  This is how  Could you imagine  Pete Johnson  From the old NEW days  The engineer that was there  For 50 years  I'm retiring  Next year 
[01:50:00]  Pete Johnson  Seeing me hitting a mic  With a hammer  He would lose his mind  My vision  Because I'm going with your Sims bit  My vision is  We do radio  Until one day  You know, we come in  And they go  Yeah, finally  You know, we can't fix this anymore  Everything broke  And there's nothing we can do  We just can't do a radio show anymore  Everything's rotted  Yeah  Because that's what's happening  Slowly but surely  But you still get paid  And no one's paying attention  Yeah  But we always get paid  Whether we get fired or not  We get paid  You get paid  Your antenna fell off 
[01:50:30]  The Empire State Building  I'm sorry  You're no longer on there  There was no engineer there  To make sure the bolts were tight  I'm glad corporate's paid attention  Because we bitch about this every day  Oh yeah  And the problems  Are not getting fixed  There's more problems  This place is slowly rotting away  In front of our eyes  It's amazing  I love that your hopes and dreams are dead  Just like  I hope the antenna falls off the building  And we can just  Yeah  Not work  And still get paid  Alright  Back to Married with Microphones  It's a terrific show 
[01:51:00]  Out of Cincinnati  Right, Sam?  Yeah, it's really good  The crew does some debate material  Well, we were doing some debate material  Let's compare what they were doing  With what we did earlier  Did you see when Obama came out though  In Nashville?  Did you think it was kind of strange  When he went  Hattie?  Did he do that?  I didn't see that part  Did he really do that?  Yeah, he had a hat on  Yeah, he did that  Price tag hanging from his head  I was watching  Did you  We were watching McCain  Did his tie jump around the screen a lot  Doing that zebra effect?  Oh, no  I think I was watching Channel 5 
[01:51:30]  It seemed like it was like  Somebody didn't tell him not to wear  Right  Was his tie striped?  It was striped, yeah  That drives me nuts  It did  It was distracting  Maybe it was a trick tie  You know, because he had on  The little carnation  That squirted water  At Tom Brokaw  Your drive  Be more funny  And then that was the out  Yeah  Yeah, the little carnation  That squirted water  On Tom Brokaw  Boom, the big out  Well, not to get too inside  But that's the dopey PDs  They're like, you know  Before a commercial break  Hit him with something big 
[01:52:00]  Big line  Big laugh  And then hit that sweeper  Boom, boom, boom  You're listening too  I want to be a guest on that show  Because I would be the funniest guest  Oh, you could not  Possibly not make  I'd be hilarious  I'd be their favorite  Unlike on this show  Of course  They're doing like a Tennessee  Like Grand Ole Opry type thing  Yeah  Joke  Yeah  Yeah, the bar's set  Perk low  Just kill on that show  That bar is set  Really low  As far as the comedy goes 
[01:52:30]  First of all  They were talking about  Striped tie  Making that weird little  Thing on TV  When people wear striped ties  On digital television  Very bad  Yeah, I've noticed that  Wouldn't do a break on it  Nope  Wouldn't even be commenting on it  If they hadn't been  There's a million other  Little things to do  You know, I'll tell you the truth  The other day I was watching  An old movie  And they were wearing  Tightly striped shirts  And the stripes were very  Close together  And I noticed  I'm like, wow 
[01:53:00]  That really does  F up the picture  But I wasn't like  Where's the pad and pen?  Where?  This is a break  I gotta  Send an email to the boys  Yeah  Remind me about  Guys  I pick up my iPhone  Guys  Oh, CC  Everybody  Alright  I noticed  With striped shirt  It made this weird  Zebra-y pattern  We're gonna talk about  Zoot suits, everyone  Yeah  Hey, there's a guy  That might do our bit  James in Jersey  How you doing, guys?

[01:54:30]  That don't have much to lose  Is what I'm thinking  Yeah, maybe we could  You know, have a prize  Something they could both  Uh, fight over  Yeah  Give them one prize  And then see who wins it  In the settlement  Well, the prize would be  Uh, Dominic Barber  That fat piece of crap  That's good  You can have him for ten minutes  For what he charges  I'm actually going to a lawyer today  To, uh  For a free consult  All right, let us know, man  If you can work this out  Let's, uh, let's do it on the show  Nothing will be free  As far as your divorce goes, sir  That's right  All right, James

Blind CC, CC, blind CC.  Shut up.  Post, post, quote it for truth.  The point we're making.  But the point we're making is you've got to acknowledge that and you've got to move past the hack stuff and find your own voice. 
[01:58:00]  And all these shows, they never do.  They never find their own voice.  They still talk with them.  By the way, this is.  They're a married couple.

[02:04:00]  yesterday  no I know all that  but when  is it going  right now  I believe people  are lined up  at the Luke oil station  we give out gas  when gas prices  are at the lowest  that they've been  in like two years  or whatever  yeah this bit  would have worked  a month ago  for us  yeah  now it's just  you know  $2 a gallon  $3 a barrel  Ronnie was saying  something  on Ron Efezio  I mean laughing  he's like  I passed the gas station  $0.45 a gallon  $0.45 a gallon  he's going  that's a good idea  because that's all 
[02:04:30]  old people talk about  yeah  and you should really  just F them up  oh yeah man  dude a dollar  what are you paying  $1.10 in Northport  I found a place  now it's an out of the way  place but it's under a buck  it was $99.99  yeah  you know so it is a dollar  you know but it's  a dollar a gallon  ain't bad  and then be distracted  right at the point  where they really need  to know where it is  oh I gotta take this call  hold on  where is it  yeah the old person  will have a stroke  I need to drive there  oh they're also  giving free lunch 
[02:05:00]  today at the diner  oh but I gotta take  this call  I'll talk to you later  oh yeah  old people  diners and gas  shut up  here we go  married with microphones  Sam is telling us  the tracks we played  yeah  nothing compared  me a bag of shells  compared to the next  two we play here  to finish up  today's jocktober bit  well those were  the opening acts  but I really wanted  a body of clips  that kind of displayed  all different elements 
[02:05:30]  of the show  you're adjusted to  why do you always say that  because you make it  sound like they're good  Sam saves the bit  by you know  adding his sarcasm  so  continue Sam  well so yeah  so I mean  I think these last two clips  are really kind of  what makes the show  I saved  because everybody's  still asking  is she or isn't she  a hole  we'll find that out  at the end of the clips  that's something  that we save  until the end  gotcha 
[02:06:00]  well the married couple  bickers on the air  like a married couple  this is why married  people don't work  together right  yes  alright  married with microphones  out of Cincinnati  but that's not all  our latest Bengal song  is on the way too  it's coming up right  after the news  because we always  have to get Angie's  approval  wait  if they're saying  the latest Bengal song  that means they have  lots of Bengal songs  yeah they specialize  in songs about  the Cincinnati Bengals  but going with  Patrice's logic  the Bengals are one  of those teams  that are just 
[02:06:30]  thrown in the league  so the really good  teams have teams  to play  but they got mad songs  but that's not all  our latest Bengal song  is on the way too  it's coming up  right after the news  because we always  have to get Angie's  approval  right after we finish  that's when you said  right  okay well  play a song maybe  for a regular song  okay we'll play  a regular song first  and then  it kind of whet the appetite  you told me  you said we'll play it  right out of the news  well  I'm just repeating  what you said verbatim  well we'll play a song  and then we'll play 
[02:07:00]  our Bengal song  you'll know the difference  I promise  yeah it'll be a  twin spin  what is that  oh they got problems  in their marriage  that's obvious  so they start laughing  after they had  a legitimate fight  so that the audience  doesn't get uncomfortable  right  you said  oh how many times  have you heard that  in a bad relationship  you said  I'm just repeating you  verbatim  you said  you would take out  the  I said  did I really  that's when you  slap the piece of paper  out of her hand  and whisper through 
[02:07:30]  your grinding teeth  shut your face  before I swear to god  is that what I said  just slap it right  out of her  treat her like a  like a bad puppy  okay sit down  shut your face  we're on the radio  I'll deal with this  after  I swear to god  I'm gonna kill you  wow  if you just slap  something out of  your chick's hand  my girl got me  decaf coffee  that I didn't want  she got me 
[02:08:00]  decaf coffee  that I didn't want  that I just  Folgers  well she gets  the expensive  little pods  I walked up  I go  I don't like that  she goes  well that's all  you get  I walked over  I slapped it  out of her hand  whack  is that all I get  huh  is that all I get  that's not what I get  I get what I want  she buys crap  huh  I buy the expensive  stuff  she buys the  expensive stuff  for her  okay  some of that  go on me  smack it right  out of her hand  I'll get what I want  shut your face  you're not my mother  I'm glad to see 
[02:08:30]  that you took care  of all those issues  that made you fat  in the first place  Bob  they didn't make me fat  my knee made me fat  alright  you wouldn't talk  to Patrice like this  favorites  you know  us comics  have our favorites  too by the way  you have a mouth  on your knee too  your knee made you  I know  hold on  hit the button  please hold  just hit the button  boo  Sam what's this  the final test  do we have a hole  I don't really  understand that  well as we've been 
[02:09:00]  listening to these clips  we hear you know  the news woman  and we hear the  married couple  but there's no  concrete evidence  that this chick  is a hole  or isn't  it's not like  every woman is a hole  they have to fit  the criteria  true true  so with this clip  you guys can be  the judge  this is the evidence  as to whether or not  she's a hole  alright  let's judge with  an open mind  $1500 for food  I'm like  what kind of food  did they have  in the refrigerator  yeah that's kind  of ridiculous  they must have  had like  two three sides  of beef 
[02:09:30]  yeah  some whole cows  in the freezer  or something  somebody's telling  a whitey  is what I think  yeah I think so too  they say it's one  of the costliest  disasters ever  in the state of Ohio  wow  apparently right up  there with the  Bengals  but I want to tell you  hey  get out of here  nice  did you see  Geraldo in Delhi  he was doing  a live resort  you can't say  something nice  don't say  something  zip it  what's up in sports  this whole thing  we don't even have  to try  no  I hope people  understand  they're doing 
[02:10:00]  a parody  of our parody  it's like  they reversed it  on us  they did a reversal  they're telling a  whitey  does that mean  they're actually  telling the truth  I don't know  what that was  I heard whitey  selling a whitey  that's not nice  you should never  say that's not  nice on a radio show  oh if you don't  have something  nice to say  the guy wasn't  even that edgy  oh that's not  nice  he said the  Bengals aren't  performing well  this season  and her response  was well that's  not nice  nice  well it's a fact 
[02:10:30]  they suck this year  you know the game  I watch every Sunday  that you never watch  the sport that you  know nothing about  right  oh gosh  they stink this year  oh now  Bob  Bob you don't have  to be so mean  shut up  come here  let me tell you  I'm gonna whack  that piece of  paper right  oh now don't  threaten  that's not  very nice  grab your  microphone cushion  I'm gonna throw  it in your face  you're gonna feel  that mic  I'd love to just

[02:34:30]  for like four or five hours after the appearance making all sorts of dope i don't know if i made any money  uh-huh it's really not about stocks it's about people you're trading people what do you say  legal you're not people's attitude that determines the price of the stock boo right and so it's trying  to guess what people are going to do uh-huh so now so much about the value of the stock right that's 
[02:35:00]  uh inconsequential when you're uh trading back and forth like that especially options what have you  been making uh money during this uh down market no i've lost a ton of money i'm an optimist and i can  never seem to bet again oh america i i want america to win and i always have uh confidence oh you're a  call guy yeah i sure am i sure it's it's a put world my friend well i wish that wasn't true and

[02:39:30]  russian phones yeah let's get what do you like about the russian phone companies uh that the  russian economy is going to do just fine they're cheaters they're always going to make money and  they have  they like it here in america russian russian russian points okay good the rushki's got to make phone  calls yeah and m-i-c-c has got fourteen small phone companies around the world and people are  still gonna use their phone to get a new job that's true and and what what is it about the russian phone  company uh that's that's so so big well they're god they're drilling more oil and uh and they're going 
[02:40:00]  to have a lot more money all right so with more money comes more phones yeah everybody uses their phone  no matter what they brush their teeth they use their phone they eat a taco and they go gambling  all right let's see what that does all right all right let's see how that works uh gallagher wow  gallagher i think you're bringing the market back yeah we're uh in positive territory right now  because of gallagher it's just up to twenty dollars something they like that gallagher because he 
[02:40:30]  showed up again abt this is a conservative play uh-huh what is that about uh drugs oh drugs let's see  you people like drugs hold on abt drugs yes 43 we're up with drugs people love drugs and russian phones  that's what we're learning gallagher we need a stock ticker you know that would now truck  why rcw this one is down so far it can't go any further i'm gonna say really yeah all right that's 
[02:41:00]  a good buying opportunity a lot of these stocks very under uh value oversold well most stocks are  at a one year low yes isn't that the time yeah yeah you got to move against the crowd well where  you at with media stocks there gallagher um i'm not too hot on media stocks uh i like you i don't  know if you consider disney a media stock but they're running all kind of deals on the where you can afford to 
[02:41:30]  go there uh-huh all of a sudden it's seventeen hundred dollars honey we can go  yeah i saw that commercial they're really pushing that i don't know uh how much is the amusement parks  uh a big part of disney's uh income i would think right yeah i think it's only about 25 percent the  rest is all this teen stuff that is doing just great and here comes christmas movies and uh that  goddamn uh molly wally or whatever whatever her name is uh uh uh you know at the hannah montana 
[02:42:00]  and then uh miley uh high school musical high school musical right very big very big and clothes  they sell clothes and all kind of tchotchkes and crap tchotchkes we're in a commercial right now  that's why we don't know if this is helping the uh the market or not yeah we'll have to look  hey gallagher uh what do you think of uh the election it's getting close now here  i think it's over you think obama is a shoe in who's the president yeah obama yeah is that good 
[02:42:30]  do you like that or no i i never cared less about an election than this one right here what about your  uh you know you're gonna be pegged on uh some capital gains taxes you're one of those rich people  he's talking about uh no i've got capital i have capital gains in real estate and losses in stocks  oh good so you offset it nice yeah i did absolutely nothing that's good you break even 
[02:43:00]  should have gone fishing  uh what do you think of jim kramer i think he's right half of the time  that's a coin toss so you're saying just toss a coin instead of listening to him you know it's not  fair that a guy gets a show for you know for being right half the time that's just doesn't seem fair  right gallagher he said to buy chesapeake oil because the owner of the company bought such a  huge position but the guy bought it at 55 and now it's uh 22 so he lost i think he bought uh 50 
[02:43:30]  million dollars worth so he lost 25 million but t boone pickens who uh always has an opinion about  oil lost a hundred million dollars on natural gas futures telling everybody to convert their car to  natural gas he had to buy options to guarantee the price and he um he took the losses out of his  company and took them personally so his little company would show a profit so t boone's not too 
[02:44:00]  smart and chesapeake's not too smart and uh jim kramer likes sears holdings and that's done terrible  if you ever go in a sears or a kmart there's nobody there yeah you uh just it sounds like you have a lot  of time on your hands on the road there gallagher well i go in three or four stores you know looking  for the stuff i'm gonna smack oh there you go hey uh uh we couldn't keep track because we were trying  to make nice radio here for the people joe d from jersey writes once gallagher said uh why rcw it went 
[02:44:30]  up six percent oh and the market is now up 55 points uh gallagher they're loving your uh your uh  commentary we started the show is down almost 250 now we're up 50 a 300 uh point turnaround in 18  minutes i say by the end of the day we're back over uh doubt 10 000 yeah i'll stop it that's my  prediction that's crazy talk one day huge crazy gains huge gains well you know everybody's afraid on 
[02:45:00]  friday frady friday right so no matter what happens during the week they're going to ruin the whole thing  on friday uh afternoon yes you know i think you're right it's pretty accurate well isn't that great  that uh a lot of people have um financial analysts people uh fox news has people from a lot of the  finance companies uh we discuss it with gallagher the guy that smashes watermelons with a big mallet  and he probably makes more sense well i just want to throw it out there i wasn't uh judging just saying 
[02:45:30]  we get to gallagher yeah yeah uh bobby you got a question for gallagher hi  robert kelly in studio there yeah gallagher hi how are you just fine i i have uh um i was thinking of  buying a cd of mine yes you can get my entire life on four cds for a lousy 22 bucks on ebay wow that's  pretty cheap well you have to bid but most of the bids go out at about 22 for 14 one-hour shows my 
[02:46:00]  entire life what if your life added up to 22 dollars yeah that's about it that's kind of sad  huh gallagher well it's not 15 so you know i'm being positive about it plus i can retire now that  i'm digitally uh kind of immortalized yeah people can just uh watch the dvds yeah they don't need to  watch the act anymore yeah but you probably don't want to say that because you want people in the  seat still right uh i want people to leave their tvs and come out and be a part of a crowd and get 
[02:46:30]  tribal oh wow sounds people need to hear and be a part of a crowd laughing i think it's necessary for  your health is it true that carrot top is on cnbc right now doing uh i hope not in commentary i don't  like that his face has gotten scary you're not supposed to scare people although halloween is  coming yeah jeez you're not a fan of the carrot top he can kick your ass with those muscles 
[02:47:00]  i don't know if he's uh aggressive he's a big guy i don't think he's aggressive though no no talking  about him like some kind of animal they're big but not aggressive you could pet them  they won't see me coming i get in and get out quick yeah i don't know you're kind of uh you have  a very distinct look to you i don't think they don't expect me to hit him in the groin all right 
[02:47:30]  all right punching the balls watch out uh carrot top we're kind of i know where the weak spot is  we're keeping gallagher on the phone because now the dow's up 137 137 gallagher you're doing well for  the market today but i don't think it's caterpillar or boeing that uh you know there's some things that  are going to drag on that market yeah what do you think you don't like caterpillar or boeing well i  don't think that uh they're going to do well right now that uh it's not the time to plant and so the  caterpillar is not going to do good and mining isn't doing good right now and uh boeing has a strike on 
[02:48:00]  and so they're going to drag it there's probably some other parts of the dow that are doing  much better than it shows oh boy you're being pessimistic yeah well i'm not just realistic  about it it's not the season to plant but i do like pot i think potash has been uh sold off really  low in monsanto monsanto they're still around yeah i remember i remember they uh they had that uh thing 
[02:48:30]  at disney where uh you'd go in uh and and shrink the monsanto uh you go into the microscope and shrink  down and take a journey into the uh the little wee world that's our strength and america is our  science science yes i'm trying to make the subatomic world more approachable to the kids i'm turning  them into action figures subatomic particle action figures did you yeah people don't know the difference  in that uh an electron and a photon between light and lightning they don't even understand how their 
[02:49:00]  phones work oh bob's gagging on a banana i'm sorry yeah gallagher uh bob steve yeah yeah people don't  understand people don't care how things work gallagher they just want them to work yeah but  they could cause cancer women shouldn't put their breasts up on a ct scan it causes cancer three percent  of the women who have a breast exam get cancer from the exam are you kidding me no if you have an  uh an exam ten times you have a thirty percent higher chance of having cancer that sounds kind 
[02:49:30]  of like a paradox yeah what the fuck are the women supposed to do then uh you're supposed to feel  around you know let the guys feel around i don't know mammograms can uh detect uh very early before you  can feel them where you can smash your your girl's tit on the uh the counter with a with a frying pan  i'm just telling people about how shoots out that they take yeah also stomach uh uh uh x-rays cause 
[02:50:00]  stomach cancer and brain yeah three you can look on wikipedia and see the numbers well wikipedia is  where i go to get all my facts yeah they're very accurate you know well you can go they give you the  source and you can go to the source also all the information's on the internet okay boo  boo boo boo boo boo um oh uh gallagher speaking of technology and science and all that did you see 
[02:50:30]  robot girl on uh drudge report no i didn't i just you mean pedo dreams a pedo's dream they finally get  robot girl there's a picture on drudge report that they can't figure out how to make a cute robot girl  yeah and they can't get good eyelids disturbing it's all scary is it all about the eyelids you think the  eyelids are really bad because let me tell i'll be honest there it was built in uh asia somewhere  right uh japan so they wanted it to be like a japanese girl or something yeah and the the latex 
[02:51:00]  that they use for eyelids yeah uh doesn't quite work very well with those type of eyes they just need  to get a toenail clipper and cut that little hunk of plastic that's sticking out yeah yeah it's like  plastic sticking out of her i think face i think they're onto something though they're trying to make  robot girl look ugly so no one fucks it i'd be all over robot girl i'd be all over it you could  put bug teeth and freckles feel bad about having a breast augmentation since her tits are fake to  begin with yeah she has no tits it's the 10 year old uh robot girl but she does have like a skin tags 
[02:51:30]  on her eyes it looks like what was that i don't know it's that thing it's where where the eyes blink  it's kind of like when you used to have toys as a kid there was always that extra plastic on your uh  army soldiers yeah it's that stuff that hangs from your grandmother's armpits look i don't care  how the eyes look how's the asshole nice and tight tight i told you i had half a torso they're  fucking good yeah gallagher where are you at with assholes uh they're the they're kids should pull 
[02:52:00]  their pants up above that hole yeah all right that's good advice yeah that's very good advice  well uh when i when i tell kids to pull their pants up they'd like pull it up like one inch  yeah you gotta really pull them up high over the pool look at the difference gotta be over there we  got the real dolls in america and china or where is it japan probably japan right they have this  awful looking robot girl yeah they have robot they have robot girls that look like asian those are  fake chicks right wow yeah wow look at that would you fuck one of those uh real dolls i have you 
[02:52:30]  you have yeah i told you i had half a torso yeah but half a torso isn't one of the real dolls you  don't need what do you need the head yes i had the middle part the asshole in the vagina that's crazy  and it had a flat back so it's stuck to the bed so you're fucking it you didn't have to hold it  no you you gotta be able to like grab the really do that let me tell you something i made it a pen  holder during the day yeah so my wife didn't think i was fucking it but and like when she left for work 
[02:53:00]  why why why wouldn't you it's it felt unbelievable and then what about trojan can you buy stock in  trojan i don't know that's a good question company yeah we'll always need we'll always need condoms  right it's just a brand name for something else like procter and gamble or something yeah well i'm  just saying if the market's not up you're going to want to take it out on somebody then go bareback  and give them the dose they have a guy oh you like that one no i'm sorry gallagher we got distracted 
[02:53:30]  and we're starting to look at the uh real dolls that are uh used no you're never distracted from  the market if you if you like pornography there's probably a way of buying stock in it i i would hope  so that would be something that's a money maker who is that george mcgovern what's he saying yeah  george mcgovern's on tv there gallagher what the fuck does he want oh god they have him in a tub  huh they have the the guy doll in the tub 
[02:54:00]  he has a realistic size mediocre cock it's like just a  like perpetually hard dick sorry gallagher we got distracted oh why'd you have to get the guy  real look at this here we go now it's uh now he's bent over in the tub he's getting a towel  they put a towel in his hand wow he's gripping the towel in pain would that be gay to have sex  with that in the ass no just because it would feel like you know rubber it's like anything else if that 
[02:54:30]  was all that's laying around and you want to get off as long as there's no voice in it that goes  come on you faggot fuck me as long as you don't give it a reach around while you're doing it  as long as you're not calling it a name now what's gay is having a luxury interior in your truck  oh okay that's pretty uh queer like i would say but not as wearing socks with your sandals not as  gay as having sex with a male latex doll i would think with blonde hair let's see what one of these 
[02:55:00]  broads look like there's no meaning anymore in america you really can't tell what is gay or odd  yeah i just use the word queer like in a queer kind of way like that's a little queer it's just a  fun word to say yeah well i don't think they should call them gay anymore because gay means happy and  they're usually pissed about something i think they should call them switched because it does appear  as though the wrong uh sex person is in the wrong body oh okay i think it's switched right like a guy a 
[02:55:30]  a woman in a guy's body kind of a thing yeah yeah and let us have the word gay back  all right as you know we'll have a gay old time i don't like to make the guy dolls really hot they  should like make one with like receding hairline like an english english professor with like a  beard wait a minute how do you know the guy doll is hot look at that all of them will  have like uh an eight pack they're all shredded there are no ugly gay men 
[02:56:00]  you haven't met my uncle all right for some reason gay men have to be good looking whereas  lesbians uh just half of them are good looking and the other half look like us all right steve is not  gay go fucking uh go over barney frank's house and he's uh you know he's gay he's he's but and  he's not very attractive yeah all right gal i think gayness is for the young oh look at that

[03:02:00]  like a recording at all that was not a computer voice when does a computer ask you a question  yeah do you know how to use this without any instruction usually it says you know say yes or  no if you i talk to computers all the time but they don't ask you ask questions i go yes you're  crazy you talk to your home computer and it answers you you probably do call you like answering machines  cunts i feel bad for the deaf guy now he's sitting there going what happened the deaf guy what about  the chick you called a cunt yeah it's fucking flipping up flicking our nails right now we'll get 
[03:02:30]  her back there was no instruction there which is what happens whenever it's a recording they will  always say say yes no or press one and then that's a recording not hi how you  doing uh and it sounds like a fucking computer yeah it sounds like a computer it's all choppy or  something hi this and they go real stupid for stupid people hello if you would like to talk to the  deaf person please press one or say cunt cunt see you just fucking blasted it out does does anyone see

You have to repeat  whatever we say.  Yeah, yeah.  Can you, uh...  Operator, can you, uh...  Get this message  to James?  Mm-hmm.  I, the operator,  am a size queen.  I need a big black one  in my cunt  and one in the shitter.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. 
[03:16:30]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  How did that go?

My last...  Calling for supervisor assistance, please hold. 
[03:17:00]  Oh, no.  Back to the supervisor.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Did we go over the top of that one?  Oh, damn.  I'm sorry.  Oh, boy.  Oh, this ain't good.  Maybe we should hang up now.  Why?  Is there a terms of service thing that we might have?  I have no idea.  Oh, hello? 
[03:17:30]  Hello?  Hello?  Hello, supervisor?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Looking for a supervisor.  No.  Can we...  Hello?  Hello?  This is supervisor 80234F.  We have determined that this is an abuse of the relay service.  I will now end this call.  No abuse.  Oh, is that what it is?  It's abuse of the service or something?  Or something?  What happened?  I don't know.  She didn't seem to want to give that last one. 
[03:18:00]  Maybe she wasn't a size queen.  Jesus is over the top, Opie.  Yeah.  I, the operator.  I, the operator.  And the size queen and, like, big black cocks.  I didn't want to shit her.  I don't know, Opie.  God, did I want to hear her repeat that back, though?  Oh, that would have been a gem.  Whoa, are we going to do it all day?  Yeah.  I wanted to hear that repeated back so bad.  Did she say something?  I think she said government.  That scared me a little.  Oh.  Government something, blah, blah, blah. 
[03:18:30]  All right.  Well, now we can take our break, because we're all doing the pee-pee dances.  I got to go pee-pee.  That was so funny.  All right.  Thank you, James.  All right.  All right.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Matt Banks from Saratoga Springs writes, I was laughing so hard on the James call on  the way home that I was crying and literally shit myself a bit in the car.  He shit himself.  Thanks, boys, for making my car smell like the operator's stinky cunt and shitter filled 
[03:19:00]  with big black cocks.  In the shitter.  And then what the hell happened in the bathroom?  I walked in to hear just you guys laughing your asses off.  I had to convey a little story.  We were next to each other, but in stalls.  Yeah.  We both were holding up paces for the last three hours.  Yeah.  So a lot of piss there.  And he's in one stall.  I'm in the one next to it.  And I tell him a little story about how Jimmy Norton, one time when we were taking a leak 
[03:19:30]  in similar fashion, would piss under the divider between the two toilets.  And it was hysterical.  I get done telling that story, and I guess Bobby thought it was a great fucking idea.  But Jimmy would do like a little, like he probably whipped his dick a little over there  just to get a few sprinkles on my side of the stall.  How do you do it with a hose to get the...  Bobby fucking just starts pissing all over the floor and all under my stall. 
[03:20:00]  It's spraying up.  It's fucking...  He's pissing fire hose piss into my stall.  So the only way I know how to fight back, I turn around and start pissing under his stall.  He's crossing the streams.  He's crossing the streams.  And his piss started winning.  I was trying to knock his piss stream down with my piss.  I want to take this opportunity to say hello to all the new listeners that are listening 
[03:20:30]  to us on Sirius.  We're fucking animals.  I got piss sprinkles all over my brand new pumas.  It was so fucking funny, though.  We're laughing our asses off as there's piss all over the floor.  And then the doors open in.  So I couldn't get out of the stall because I didn't want to step in his puddle.  Now a huge puddle of piss is in my stall, and I'm standing in a corner where there's  no piss.  But then I have to open the door, and I'm in the way of the door. 
[03:21:00]  So I got to hold on to the door and swing on it.  Holy shit.  That's one of the funnest things I've ever done in my life.  I don't want to lose Gabe because he has the rules of what you can and can't do with  deaf operators.  Gabe, what do you got?  Hey, what's going on, fellas?  Hey, man.  Hey, it was a little bit out of control and wacky with you guys, but every time you finish  a comment or finish whatever you have to say, you have to tell the relay operator, go ahead.  And that's how she knows to continue. 
[03:21:30]  That's how she knows that your message is over.  Okay.  All right, so you say go ahead, and you can say whatever you want.  A relay operator has to say whatever you guys, whatever you, she has to type down it  and relay the message to the deaf person.  Whatever you guys say, she has to say it.  All she risks, she risks the chance of getting fired.  So anything that you tell her, you can say, cunt this, cunt that, but you can't involve  the relay operator.  And that's why you guys got booted.  And this is actually regulated by the FCC.  It's a government program.  So they might track your phone number down.  Yeah.  Like we haven't had our run-ins with them. 
[03:22:00]  Yeah, no kidding.  I guess they know you guys just a little bit.  Yeah, so you can also go check out, if you guys get a chance, stoprelayabuse.com.  Stoprelayabuse.com.  They have a whole...  Is this like a whole thing people are doing?  Opie's photo is on the front page.  This is a big thing, man.  Like, it's a major thing.  And that's why they train you with, we're going to notify a supervisor, because the  supervisor is actually part of the FCC, whatever, FCC employee.  Right.  And they, I guess, they relay the information to the FCC. 
[03:22:30]  Oh, that's wonderful.  So I guess you guys are on watch again.  My name is Jim Norton, if anybody's listening.  Yeah.  I can't believe Norton did that today.  That's crazy.  Some people think that James might be Jim Norton.  We'll find out.  That's true.  He's back on the show Friday.  That was fucking awesome.  I'll tell you, do it again.  Fuck it.  All right.  Thank you, Gabe.  I appreciate the knowledge.  Tony in Iowa.  Tony.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Love the show.  Thank you.  Yeah, man.  When I was in high school, about five years ago, me and my buddy went to our deaf friend's 
[03:23:00]  house, and he called up this chick on that telemarketing thing you guys did, and he was fucking  her having phone sex over that.  And the operator was doing it.  She didn't have no problem.  All right.  That's her angle.  He was like, please bang me harder.  Yeah, yeah.  That's the angle.  That's the angle.  Yeah, not, hey, operator, you cunt angle didn't work.  No, that probably wasn't the best.  All right.  Get James to call back.  Who wants to play?  Well, who wants to?  Bobby, we got a role for you today.  Gay phone sex with James. 
[03:23:30]  Let's say hi to Jason.  Nope.  We lost Jason.  All right.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  Maybe James will call back, and we'll do a little, uh, phone for her.  Okay.  What else is going on?  Whew.  Oh, uh...  Ann Curry.  Yes.  Ann Curry.  She, uh, she's on the Today Show.  Yes, she is.  And, uh, you know what?  We should do this, because, uh, Robert Kelly's in studio today. 
[03:24:00]  She's trying her hand at comedy.  At stand-up.  No.  Is that what that was?  I think I...  We're doing it at, uh, Caroline's, a club we love.  We love Greg Charles.  The guy takes care of us every time we're there.  Yeah.  Uh, and I guess we couldn't play this on the other side, because she went very, very stereotypical  Asian.  What?  To Today Show.  But she can't, because she's Asian.  No, Ann Curry's not Asian, is she?  Huh?  I think she has some Asian in her. 
[03:24:30]  I think she might have a Japanese mom or something.  A little inner?  Yeah, she's got a little Asian.  Japanese mom.  So, uh, we've grabbed a couple clips of this.  You want to listen?  I certainly do.  All right.  Let's start with this one.  Good evening, everybody.  You're so nice.  So nice.  Thank you so much.  You are my very first, uh, comedy club audience.  I'm really appreciating your being here.  You know, uh, for those of you, uh, who are wondering, yes, I am that woman on, on television.  You know, people actually ask me for my autograph.  Sometimes when they walk away, I can actually overhear them saying, oh my God. 
[03:25:00]  We just met Connie Chung.  I guess she is then.  Holy shit.  You don't look anything like Connie Chung.  We got a picture of her.  This is Ann Curry.  You know Ann Curry.  I know, but there's so many of them.  That is such a stretch.  I can't, uh, stop really.  A Connie Chung joke.  Connie hasn't been on.  All right.  Okay.  I see.  Does that look like Connie Chung to you?  Uh, I could see how people could mistake her for Connie Chung.  Guess what? 
[03:25:30]  I thought, uh, Ann Curry was black until today.  Until right now?  Swear to God.  Really?  You thought she was black?  I thought she was white skinned black.  Yes, I did.  She's Asian.  Yeah, she's definitely Asian.  I see now a little bit.  A little bit?  You think she's in the sun taking the photo?  She's just, uh, okay.  That took a second.  Yeah, very nice.  Jeez.  And then, uh, Ann Curry continues.  I guess this is how they kill time with their, uh, their show.  Yeah.  And then we kill time on our show playing what they're doing to kill time. 
[03:26:00]  As a time killer.  Uh, Ann Curry doing stand-up at Caroline's.  The truth is that, uh, my dad loved telling...  Oh, can you...  Can you play a game on her?  Yeah.  Okay.  Hello?  Hello.  This is operator 80274F with an IP relay call.  Do you know how to use relay?  Um, yes, I do.  Thank you. 
[03:26:30]  Hi.  Thank you, and...  Wait, what do you guys just say?  You understand?  Thank you.  And, uh, one moment, please, for the caller to begin.  Okay, over.  All right, let's start.  What was the point?  You have to say your thing and then...  What was it?  Go ahead.  I don't know.  Hello?  Hello?  One moment, please, for the caller's response.  Okay, go ahead.  Go ahead.  I'm going to smoke a blunt, but in a pipe. 
[03:27:00]  Does anyone have any tabs?  Go ahead.  Okay, um, I would love to smoke a blunt, too, but not the kind you're talking about.  I'd like to smoke your blunt, James.  I would like to take your...  One moment, please. 
[03:27:30]  Oh, sorry.  One moment, please.  Um, may I remind you to please speak a bit slower?  Okay.  I know I'm required to type everything that you're saying.  Okay.  So, um, can you please repeat that from...  I would love to smoke blunt, too, but...  Yes.  All right, I'll shorten it and I'll go slower, okay?  Okay.  Okay.  Uh, I would like to smoke a blunt, but not the kind you're smoking.  I would like to smoke your cock.  Go ahead.  She's typing. 
[03:28:00]  Holy shit.  I bet she wanted to be a princess growing up.  Oh.  Mm-hmm.  I'm waiting for James' response.  Don't sound gay, or I could find you in a trunk, correction, in a trunk, of the 800-horsepower-775 torque with good brakes. 
[03:28:30]  Go ahead.  I'm not sounding gay. 
[03:29:00]  I'm being honest.  I would like to kiss and bite your bush fat and open your ass with my fingertips as far as I can and glaze down the crack.  Oh, um, one moment, please.  Yes.  Um, can you please repeat that from, and open your ass with your fingertips?  Open your ass with my fingertips. 
[03:29:30]  With my fingertips.  And glaze down your ass-crack hair with my pointy tongue, deep inside the crevice of your hole.  Oh, um, one moment, please, um, can you please repeat that from, and glaze down your ass-crack hair with my pointy tongue, deep inside the, uh... 
[03:30:00]  Deep inside your hole.  Um, and swirl it around like a dirty ice cream cone.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Yeah. 
[03:30:30]  Bobby, tell him you want to have sex with his ears. 
[03:31:00]  I've been thinking of a way to deal with my neighbor.  That sounds gay.  Go ahead.  One moment please, the caller has interrupted.  Yes.  Give me free stuff for this. 
[03:31:30]  Go ahead.  I would like when you, I like, excuse me, I'm sorry, I like when you slowly suck on my  earlobes and then slap your large cock off my cheek, inside of my mouth, and then off  of my tongue until pre-semp comes out.
