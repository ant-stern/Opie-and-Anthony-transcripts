<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion of Mark McGwire's admission of steroid use.  The hosts satirized McGwire's explanation, suggesting "radio steroids" as the reason for their own success.  Their ire then turned to Bob Costas, whom they vehemently criticized for his perceived over-dramatization of sports events, a sentiment echoed by several callers.  The conversation dissected McGwire's career statistics, debated the perjury implications of his previous denials, and speculated on the effects of his confession on other athletes, particularly Barry Bonds.  A St. Louis caller expressed continued support for McGwire.  Joe Buck also received criticism.  The segment transitioned into a discussion of the long-term health risks of steroids, a humorous tangent about Babe Ruth potentially using performance-enhancing drugs, and a caller's suggestion for a "designated juicer" rule.  The segment concluded bizarrely with a showing of vintage pornography and a caller's inquiry about the effect of McGwire's confession on the value of his rookie cards, followed by Kennyâ€™s crude, auto-tuned rendition of Owl City's "Fireflies."  The upcoming appearances of William Shatner and Bob Kelly were promoted.

The show continued with a focus on Kenny's auto-tuned songs, described as "hits," prompting various listener calls, some using vulgar language. Producer Sam was mentioned and later appeared in studio.  The hosts discussed Troy Kwan's work on Kenny's songs and speculated on the station's potential attempt to remove Troy from the show due to the lack of proper Pro Tools equipment.  A tangent involved a flawed description of the "Be the Boss" show on E Street Radio.  Kenny's upcoming songs, including covers of Miley Cyrus ("Party in the USA") and Lady Gaga ("Bad Romance"), were discussed, with a clip of the latter played.  Crude jokes followed concerning a New York Post article featuring Jim Norton.  The hosts mocked a SiriusXM contest and the inaccurate description of their show in promotional materials.  The upcoming appearances of Bob Kelly and William Shatner were mentioned again.  The segment concluded with a clip of William Shatner reading Sarah Palin's tweets and a lengthy interview with Shatner about his talk show, "Raw Nerve," covering his experiences, guest selection, opinions on other talk show formats, and his thoughts on the new Star Trek movie.

A lengthy in-studio interview with William Shatner followed.  The conversation covered his *Star Trek* experiences, including anecdotes about stunt doubles and on-set conflicts.  A story about Gene Simmons' alleged inappropriate advances toward Shatner's then-girlfriend, a traffic reporter who sometimes interviewed for the show, was recounted.  This led to a discussion of Shatner's romantic relationships, including details about a nine-year relationship and subsequent shorter relationships.  He also revealed personal details about his past relationships and the death of his wife.  Shatner discussed his acting career, upcoming projects including *Shatner's Raw Nerve*, and clarified a previous story about Meat Loaf's parents dying of carbon monoxide poisoning, correcting it to apply to "Weird Al" Yankovic's parents.  Bob Kelly, also in studio, discussed his new TV show concept, "Robert Kelly Detective Inc.", generating numerous off-color suggestions from the hosts and callers.  The segment concluded with discussion of Simon Cowell leaving American Idol and a comedic bit about a Shatner voice remix.

The final segment featured Bobo, a stand-up comedian, discussing his upcoming Buffalo debut, where he'd be paid $100 plus $5 per ticket.  Concerns about his preparedness, given his short preparation time and limited experience, were expressed by the hosts and a caller, "Uncle Luke," who voiced concerns about the venue's location.  The hosts then acted as a heckling audience for a play-by-play of Bobo's set, which consisted largely of offensive, sexually explicit, and homophobic jokes about his surgeries and experiences with urologists and anesthesia.  Kenny interrupted to test Bobo's improvisational skills.  Bobo's t-shirt designs and plans to record a CD ("The Bobonator") were discussed.  Heather Heide and Mersh were mentioned in relation to the Buffalo gig.  The show concluded with well-wishes for Bobo, a song, and promotion of upcoming appearances by Jim Norton and William Shatner.

[00:01:00]  injured well to help his injuries and he said what he started doing steroids in 93 94 oh boy look at  the stats well you look at his stats in 93 94 season he uh well the 93 season he had nine home runs the  94 season he had nine home runs so he might have been introduced to steroids because he was injured  yeah but then realized wow this this shit rocks helps because then his home run totals just get 
[00:01:30]  ridiculous you know it's fucked up though he he does say like uh well they don't you can't just take  steroids and bash home runs like he did like if me or you or danny or anybody in here just started  doing steroids we're not gonna be smacking home run balls over the fucking thing you still have to  have a talent well he had the talent to begin with he had the skill set that's what i mean yeah that's  that's what we're talking about if you have the skill set now you got the steroids now your skill set 
[00:02:00]  gets way better now you rule then you rule like see if we had let's say there was a radio steroids  see we rule on the radio oh my god yeah now if we had oh my radio steroids we would fucking like  people would be like they have to be doing radio steroids because they now they're just out of  control the best ever ever and the only reason we don't do radio steroids is because we are the 
[00:02:30]  best right now yeah why i'd rather not be accused huh yeah of course of doing radio steroids i'd rather  just people go he's just doing it natural there are people that do radio steroids and you know it's  all hack they suck you can tell they're all juiced up but uh we like really natural wait a minute  steroids and radio really yes radio steroids have you seen your fellow radio broadcasters they're all  fat fucks it doesn't work like uh sports steroids fat fucks low self-esteem and can't help themselves 
[00:03:00]  more to a buffet it makes them giant and fat right and hacky but for some reason you talk like  i'm not on the juice i'm not on the juice dude they all have the same voice exactly  so i don't know mark mcguire was kind of crying and yeah what was he weeping well what happened and of  course they had to pick bob costas the stupid fucking purist that he is boy you do not like 
[00:03:30]  that gentleman i i don't know what happened i turned the corner on this bob costas with his  stupid over the top dyed it's not he's got fake hair though it's soy sauce it's soy sauce i'm trying  not to use a great line but soy sauce dyed hair but then it's a it's a rug yeah he's got a hair piece  does he have a piece that i think he dipped into soy sauce and then stapled to his head oh  maybe he let it steep in tea someone's gotta explain to me why i hate bob costas so much because 
[00:04:00]  i can't really explain it i was watching the winter classic and he had to try to make these moments  it's like shut the fuck up they're playing hockey outdoors at fenway park you don't have to  like overdo it he wants the big with the catchphrase with the pre-produced packages no it's not even  that because he doesn't even really do the color he does all but he just wants like yeah he wants to  be the guy though that people look at and go wow bob costas yeah fuck the game did you see bob costas 
[00:04:30]  you know back in the day they used to play hockey on the charles river and now it comes home to  fenway today did they though well not like how did they play with the duck tours going through  it must have been hard to shoot a goal with the duck tour the duck boats come through and you lose  the puck right how did before global warming kids played outdoor hockey indeed on ponds and lakes and 
[00:05:00]  rivers and today we bring it home to fenway park do we for the winter classic  which by the way the winter classic means nothing yeah what is it just pick two teams  every year to play hockey outside it doesn't they're not playing for anything except for  another win for their team nothing for standings or anything no they got to kind of figure out how  to make it into something you know make it into some kind of make make an actual cup the winter 
[00:05:30]  classic cup and then try to pick the teams that earned a birth into the winter classic i don't know  well that's what they uh how you would do it but well they did that with the all-star game they  kind of made that you know home field advantage kind of a thing that's not fair for that no it's not  but because you got a lot of guys playing i i never understood that one is you're a baseball fan the all-star  game right so whatever side wins that division uh that uh league gets home home field for the world 
[00:06:00]  series but every year you got a bunch of all-stars that have no chance at at at at at playing in the  postseason so what do they give a shit about they don't get i know they just wanted to make  it interesting so people watch the fucking game right because people weren't well they felt  miserably because i don't care no i don't care either you go oh wow you're like looking at some  all-star players that's it i bet they uh i bet they dropped that at some point they have to because  it just doesn't make sense really doesn't so this mark mcguire was on bob costas and uh he was 
[00:06:30]  getting a little chokey a little choked up a little chokey like i can't you know what's  fucked up i'm looking at mark mcguire and i'm thinking wasn't that like last week he was swinging  for the fences and and now well don't even say the year and then yeah pressing as hell like what  year was that oh fuck yeah i think it was like 1972 or something what year was the big 70 home run  year that was 98 it was 90 jesus and he retired in 2002 dude so 98 12 years ago well we're still in 
[00:07:00]  the early 2010 so i i like to say 11-ish does it matter at that point a lot let's just call it 11-ish  i'm saying 12 years ago know what 12 years is to a major league baseball player that's uh more than  half of uh uh their careers yeah yeah for a lot of it's for some people it's their whole career  right so rookies in 98 yeah are now looking at the twilight of their careers that's that's how long 
[00:07:30]  ago that was already uh let me go let me go to ken in uh new hampshire he shares my hate for bob  costas hey there ken what's up ken hey guys how's it going no pretty good man obi you totally are right  about bob costas i couldn't figure out why i hated him but on the winter classic they strategically  place him in the foreground in the background they have kids skating around the pond and the  outfield at Fenway Park but they didn't put up with the kids because he's just as tall as the kids and 
[00:08:00]  then you don't realize how short he is until mike middleberry skates up and doubled the size of  bob costas it was amazing thank you you're helping me with this so this is what i mean by forcing  moments they they they put them right in front of little peewees playing yeah like they have another  rank besides the big rank that the big boy's gonna play on and then and then and then he's trying to  say how the kids love hockey so much they don't even notice that mike millberry is is is uh no who 
[00:08:30]  was talking with bob costas at that point oh i lost him but there was a big star and bob costas like  they don't even care you're here all they care about is playing hockey shut up  shitty let's go to jared in boston jerry jerry hey guys uh bob costas is a douchebag uh the main  reason is those little set up pieces and it always starts out like on an ice rink built in his father's  backyard okay thank you yes stories what a fucking douche shut up we get stories thank you that's 
[00:09:00]  exactly what i'm getting at these these pushing the the moments it all started for him deep in the  woods of canada in a little pond with a stick and a dream he went on the ice shot it you're  fucking a hack if these guys down the hall could find bob costas just shoving uh forcing moments  they would make me very happy today but back to uh the story at hand mark mcguire i'm just looking at 
[00:09:30]  the picture that he's getting a a c ever coop goatee going yeah he sure really is getting that  puffy white fucking goatee thing going he looks like he could still play though he doesn't look  as think he doesn't look as thin as he used to be he'll look uh he'll look all right in the uh  the uh uniform there and the cardinals uniform when you think he's not gonna be fucking hall of  fame batting coach oh yeah the batting coach thing yeah batting coach he'll be he'll be there in 
[00:10:00]  the uniform i forgot about that yeah a few sizes smaller than it used to be but a little uh you  know a little baggy than it used to be baggy he'll be crying could you hit the ball that's all he does  now is cry the steroids kept like they blocked up his fucking tear ducts or something because now he's  just they make you kind of like cry like a bitch wishy-washy well here's uh a couple choice clips for  the big mark mcguire interview yesterday oh she hit 49 home runs as a rookie in 1987 were you using 
[00:10:30]  steroids at that time no you use them first what season well what season uh well during the season  would be uh starting i started using it uh the 93 going the winter of 93 94 going in that that season  and i was introduced to steroids i mean steroids was one of the gyms that mcguire steroids back in  the day that was just introduced that was it it was readily available i believe it was the winter of 
[00:11:00]  uh 89 into 90 i was given a couple weeks worth tried it never thought anything of it just moved on from  it but i never thought as far as using it on a consistent basis was the winter of uh 93 and 94  that's it huh so yeah that was all he's fessing up to so far yeah come on now uh kent the movie guy  writes i guess we got instant feedback i don't know what's going on with it we're oh oh i know i i just 
[00:11:30]  got a check that i had to sign and send out don't send another check out to these guys sent me  bob sent me a check and i'm supposed to sign it and send it out you didn't sign it right fuck no  because i i already sent one out here's what i did with that  through the shredder yeah because enough is enough we gotta like uh that's enough that's enough 
[00:12:00]  enough is enough exactly the company will be paying for instant feedback i assist but until then i  think we're paid up so i think you could use instant feedback uh kent the movie guy writes  bob costas tries to make everything a sports classic not every sports event is fucking field  of dreams or the natural there you go that's a good way very good that's a good way to look at it  look he puts in a movie reference movie references of course well of course he does but that's a great  way to look at it yeah sometimes yeah you're you know you're seeing a moment and then you as the 
[00:12:30]  sportscaster like a bob costas then uh then go with it the fucking yeah those pieces where sarsis  and the camera pans down from the sky on a cold winter field morning yeah and says sarsis sarsis  a walk walk canada many people say a field of dreams this is a field of dreams a dream that came true for  for that mcguire continues you must genuinely regret not just the fact that you've been in 
[00:13:00]  virtual exile for a while you got only 23 percent of the hall of fame vote but what you're sitting  here telling me is that you could have done essentially what you did without ever touching  performance enhancing drugs yeah that's your that's why it's just it's um it's the most regrettable  thing i've ever done in my life did tony la russa no you know no i i gotta stop this it's real easy 
[00:13:30]  to say that you could have done exactly what you did without the steroids but but you don't know  for sure because you were on the steroids yeah anyone could say that i mean the numbers the numbers  don't lie yeah all of a sudden he hit 65 and 70 home runs uh back-to-back seasons it wasn't even close  to that uh prior to the steroid and look at pictures of him he was a skinny little guy  as a rookie and then he was jacked dude he went arms like fucking holiday hams he went 22 homers 
[00:14:00]  okay 42 homers in in pretty much complete seasons then he was hurt so he went nine home runs in 93  nine home runs in 94 so those those were the hurt years and then he started doing the steroids he  pops up to 39 52 58 come on then he played partial seasons and went 34 24 in home runs and then had  the big 70 home run season 65 home run season late in his career that's done he'd have done that no 
[00:14:30]  fucking way he'd have done it without anything without a bat i hear no he could have done it without a bat  just swinging his hand right and smacking it like a handball let's just put it this way before  uh the season where he hit 70 and he made it to steroids so we got to say he didn't use steroids  probably before 93 right so the best home run production he had before the before uh steroids  was 49 home runs now was he lying in front of congress that time yeah he said that so is it isn't that 
[00:15:00]  no no uh well travis travis do you have some information on well not necessarily he no he  wanted to admit more than he did but he was scared you could tell he was shaken and he was fucking he  was scared he was a a quivering ass in front of congress but wasn't that like uh well no because  he said no because he said i'm not here to talk about the past right so apparently when he met with  the with congressman before uh before that he admitted to everything oh and said i ain't getting out 
[00:15:30]  there and again going on the record with this he said that yeah he was afraid of legal troubles and  then dragging his family and his friends into it so yes he took the hit and said you know i'm not  here to talk about the past i'm not here to talk about the past hey uh mark that's what everyone's  here to talk about that's the only reason sitting here yeah right and can you sit with all the needles  that have been poked into your fucking hiney into your coolie let's go to john in new jersey john 
[00:16:00]  hi john hi john hey what about battery bond going from 160 pounds to over 200 jack and 70  old months a year that was just his head though dude i mean there's a whole list of these guys that  realized oh my god i got a good skill set i take the steroids i'm going to be even better and they all  jumped on board because they had they had a lot to lose they saw their peers doing it yeah and they 
[00:16:30]  see their contracts running up uh running out and they know if they could get their numbers up they're  going to get a massive contract you know there was a lot of peer pressure there too all right let's  start thinking about this what do you think uh you see you mark mcguire uh coming out of uh saying  he did the steroids and then uh he's done not many consequences do you think you see a lot more  ballplayers that have done the steroids coming out and they admitted to it i don't i don't know dog  hey punch you out guys good job all right thank you honestly though do you think uh you see 
[00:17:00]  depending on what happens to mcguire right uh he wasn't the first yeah but but he is the highest  profile motherfucker to come out and say he did steroids bonds is right up there you know what though  bonds bonds and that big steroid head of his bonds is going to be the last person to ever he'll be  the last person to admit to you're right oh yeah he'll never admit dude mcguire remember that time  the sosa mcguire battle that was an amazing baseball back from the strike uh bullshit yep and it was 
[00:17:30]  huge him admitting to steroids i think is the biggest uh baseball player to admit to the road oh i see what  you're saying yeah of course and and now depending on how the public perceives this sports writers  everybody else do you think you see other ball players starting to come out and go yeah i did it  too all right or do you think they keep their yaps shut they'll probably keep their yaps shut  yeah they want people just to think they were just great without any juice yeah you know what i mean 
[00:18:00]  because then you're basically admitting you're flawed and you cheated it's so ridiculous to deny it now  though i think you try to hide as best you can you see you see there's pictures of them there's  statistics there's shit it's like look you're a monster right and then you you you retired and  you turned into like you know the guy next door that just mows his lawn let's go back to um  okay so where we where we were uh mark mcguire said that he could have done exactly what he did 
[00:18:30]  without the steroids but that's a stupid statement because you know we don't we don't have we don't  have that to compare to what he did he did steroids because salsa said so regrettable thing i've ever  done in my life did tony la russa know either in oakland or in st louis that you were involved  with steroids no he found out this morning oh that's a lie too by the way come on yeah i mean 
[00:19:00]  come on i think he's still just lying tony la russa they're all he's a smart man he these guys know  come on yeah they gotta know they hear the whispering and they hear the what the hell is that or maybe  they didn't uh confront them you know you turn the blind eye right all sudden you know like  the physician comes to tony la russa with all the stats of the players and go well mark mcguire  uh well he's gained 40 pounds in the offseason and it's all muscle sir it's all in his fucking arms 
[00:19:30]  here you go it's all down here in my report uh yeah tony la russa was looking at reports and i'm not  gonna look at that so could you just put it in my drawer and leave it there sir good news arm  good news mark mcguire's uh body fat is down to uh less than one percent he gained 45 pounds of muscle  these motherfuckers were skinny little bastards danny's going through a montage of pictures i mean 
[00:20:00]  look at that and and what you you almost forget when you see the before and after of uh bonds and  mcguire you almost think you're looking at a high school picture when they're playing high school  baseball and if you didn't see the a's uniform you wouldn't know any better yeah they were already in  the major leagues already thin guys and then monsters a mere few years and then just fucking  huge arms fucking home run hitting arms really la russa wasn't in the in the locker room and mcguire 
[00:20:30]  took a shirt off really never saw that and went wow that i don't remember that fucking body a few  years ago he had a little stick arms come on la russa knew oh my god everybody knows everyone talks  they spend almost a year together well that's the big uh that's the big sports story today  well it continues you were involved with steroids no he found out this morning liar liar 
[00:21:00]  he has that was a hard call yeah he's been one of your biggest supporters even to the point where  some people were skeptical about him saying you know what mark worked hard he did it legitimately  did you did you feel as if you he's like he's like he's like talking to my dad  yeah i brought a lot of people down it doesn't feel good  uh hi so you lied to your dad what can i tell you i i came from a small town with two skinny arms 
[00:21:30]  oh that's terrible listening to him fucking uh not at all stop whining it's not terrible if you  if you got to see how he lives his life you wouldn't you wouldn't think it's terrible 
[00:22:00]  if he thinks it's so terrible and and and it was bad then give all the money back  but you just kind of i think you look silly once you get all the roids i don't want to give money  back or any of that i don't give a shit in the end i do give a shit that they're flat out lying to  us do you think you just look shit uh silly though like because you he he was so fucking  big from the roids and then you just stop and you turn up later in court or in front of congress 
[00:22:30]  and then you just look like you look like all you like the first thing i thought was uh-oh  what's that pancreatic what does he got sure and tony la russa didn't see the body change after he  retired yeah and still wasn't thinking wait a minute there's something here with the steroid  exactly that everyone else was whispering about he's playing catch with his kid he can't get it to  him he's fucking he's rolling rolling into his son's glove  ah the phone's lit my god let's go to st louis let's say hi to jim hey jim 
[00:23:00]  uh hey guys i just had a couple things to say the first thing is uh yeah mcguire's going to be the  hitting coach on opening day but a crazy thing is that la russa gave an interview and he said  that he would take uh mcguire and when the rosters expand in september potentially use him as a pinch  hitter now it sounded crazy but i think tony you know because he has that father-son relationship  with him wants to um if he uses mcguire as a pinch hitter it'll automatically freeze his hall of fame  ballot for five years so that was the first thing i found interesting maybe something would come out but 
[00:23:30]  basically i just wanted to say that uh even though uh i thought it was completely fucking insane that  he said that he didn't think the steroids helped him hit all those home runs yeah i forgive him  st louis still loves him and they're going to give him a standing ovation on opening day hopefully  oh hell yeah and you guys and you should what the hell you know you know listen i mean guys  it's hard to explain to somebody who's not a cardinal fan but i was there when he hit the goddamn home  run that broke the record i saw him jump into the stands i was a little kid and it was like looking 
[00:24:00]  at a god man i tell you when i saw him on the tv last night i mean yeah i'll probably be cracking  jokes about at the bar tonight i was misty it fucked me up well he's your boy you know we just yeah  we watched i think we watched mcguire from afar here in new york i mean he's not our boy  of course when that when that motherfucker came up to bat everyone was looking when he swung  and you just watched the the entire stands light up with flashes from cameras i mean that shit was an 
[00:24:30]  amazing time for baseball and i could give a i really could give a flying fuck what he was taking  it worked it it made for great uh uh baseball the uh mcguire sosa rivalry that was going on  it was exciting uh like i said when he stepped up to bat you fucking you paid attention you were  watching so i don't give a shit what he was taking it worked it worked for baseball it worked for him 
[00:25:00]  fuck it we're just going over the audio today and it's obvious there's some uh half truths in here  that's all that's not a line sack of shit but yeah uh yes jim i think that by you guys are giving  bob costas maybe too hard of a time you know i don't like him hey mister like everybody oh wait  no i don't like everybody it just seems like his piss i've met the guy in person and his passion for  the game is just infectious and i think he doesn't realize he's an unintentional douchebag sometimes but  really the sport's better off with him without it i really think but the problem is jim didn't he do 
[00:25:30]  some time in st louis oh well absolutely but you know what i've always considered him a new york boy  nobody considers him a st louis and i mean we don't even fucking like joe buck here  i know what no one really likes joe buck that much what's that about i like the joe buck  do you like joe buck yeah i don't mind the joe buck oh man he's a major drop-off after his old man  his father was a class i'm not saying he's as good as the old man but i don't mind the joe buck  yeah i mean i just don't like how he thinks he's a fucking comedian i mean uh it was pretty good when  he was ripping him apart man i like doing the name game with his last name 
[00:26:00]  joe buck bo buck bo nana fana fo oops all right jim enough of you thank you all right good job  enough of you thank you uh mike in new orleans he concurred hey good morning fellas how y'all doing  hey man i'm hoping your saints drop out soon oh gee well fuck you too well i got my i got my jet still  in this thing that's all right i think i think they blew their wad last week guys so  we'll see what happens that jets are favored my friend jets are favored what my my first thing 
[00:26:30]  is with the fellas talking about joe buck joe buck is kind of like the ryan seacrest of the sports  casters and uh my second thing is marl mcguire i was over the catch-22 with him he started taking  the roids because it it was the injuries and it pretty much furthered his career but at the end  his knees were so fucked up from taking the roids that's what ended his career so you know it was a  catch-22 for him thanks i always did like wait wait wait wait slow down you really think the 
[00:27:00]  steroids were the reason why his knees went bad at the end or the fact that he was at the end of his  career he was getting towards the end of the career but i think the steroids messed up the joints so  bad i mean you look then he should have taken more steroids to fix the joints inject it right into  the knees that's what you know i mean i think that's it probably going to be like one of those  professional wrestlers that took so much juice over the years they you know was it lex luger one of  them did they i read a article about him he walks with a cane at it for them yesterday mcguire has to 
[00:27:30]  worry about uh the long-term effects of uh juicing like that i mean the guy's got to worry if a blood  vessel's gonna bust or if he's gonna fucking just you know keel over or uh end up with some kind of  bizarre cancer or some shit yeah yeah and that's just what i think would happen i mean look i'm like  you anthony and then opie i mean that no you're not we're funny you suck it was uh no 98 was fucking 
[00:28:00]  awesome watching that you know it was it was great yeah if you're a sports fan really you really you  really can't argue that point it was a great year yeah he and sammy so alone they brought baseball  backers i mean it was a fucking sport that was dying no one was watching i mean it just it sucked  really did all right mikey thank you i want to give everyone else a turn here we got thank you we got a  lot of uh people want wanting in on this one dave in florida what's up dave hey guys i got a totally 
[00:28:30]  different view on the steroids man i think it should be mandatory in all professional sports  i don't want to see i don't want to see little guys like me and you two out there on a football  field tapping shoulders i want to see monsters out there i'm paying 150 bucks to take me and my  kid to a football game i want to see some animals out there killing each other be the best you can  be yeah you want a head to pop off or something yeah i mean i'm so with you because it is expensive  to take people to a sporting event now so i want all these guys on steroids you're right man 
[00:29:00]  you're absolutely right and where does it stop like like if if if they eat properly and work out  like a a motherfucker they're going to get huge so like uh you know what do you curb that dude i've  been uh the express lane i've been around gyms my entire life and and you see the guys that well  why don't you just talk about your stupid frozen oranges in florida and i'll shut the fuck up  frozen oranges how are you fucking oranges encased in ice they're fucking frozen solid 
[00:29:30]  talk about you i'm in the keys and it's 45 freaking green well good for you you queer well what would  he do you and your fucking icy oranges you and your icy oranges and your stupid fucking underwater  motel could go fuck themselves thank you dave you made a good point but i was just trying to 
[00:30:00]  maybe have a conversation you know my collaboration thank you dave all right i don't even remember what  i'm saying i don't know i i've been around gyms my entire life and you see the guys that do exactly  what you uh say they eat right yeah take a few vitamins maybe and work out and then you see the  guy cheating and fucking popping his ass with some steroids and he's a monster within a couple  months yep um there's a million guys out there right now that have seen the same exact shit in  in gyms across america giant veiny fucking dude it's an easy cow leg arms whatever you call it in your 
[00:30:30]  state up here it's the easy pass it's the easy pass to looking like a monster but there are consequences  of course of course uh what is it oh this is a very good question coming in a little old school  right here charlie on long island charlie morning boys how are you what's up charlie hey charlie  uh anthony can you ask your good friend don west what's the impact on mcguire rookie cards that's a  very good uh question today considering that mcguire is now admitting he did the steroids gonna be uh 
[00:31:00]  even bigger collectors items gonna be bigger collectors items actually what we're doing fuck  the rookie cards we're taking the last season he played card the last season poking holes through  his eyes and in the back putting a wet towel so he cries a crying mcguire card crying mcguire card  crying mcguire cards i hear you open up the the packaging and it's already just wet it's all wet 
[00:31:30]  from the bubble gum is already gobby and wet because of his salty tears salty tears  poor fuck what do you mean poor fuck i was done was back on the air that fucking asshole before  everyone says that poor fuck mark mcguire i want to see what kind of car he's driving i'm sure i  want to see very well for himself but fucking living materialistic things aren't always the 
[00:32:00]  end all be all of everything he's probably very uh upset about what he's done really uh the fact  that uh he probably will not get into the hall of fame and uh he's uh a pretty much a disgraced  uh superstar but i think the only reason the only reason he's doing all this is to try to get into  the hall of fame because uh do you think well when was travis when was he eligible uh he's been on 
[00:32:30]  three ballots yeah there he's got 12 left yeah but 25 percent or something no way this it's not  even but i'm just saying it it wasn't looking good so he's trying anything this is like this is a hail  mary go going well maybe if i admit all this and come clean then maybe they'll understand that this was  the era of baseball uh and and uh i think this was more about him being the hitting coach for the  cardinals and it was gonna come yeah it was gonna come on that could be it he'd be better off just  shutting his mouth about the hall of i think he's written off the hall of fame all this does is make 
[00:33:00]  the sports writer say see we were right yeah we were right you know what though baseball could go  fuck themselves because everyone knows mcguire and sosa like aunt was saying a little while ago  brought everyone back to baseball yeah so if there wasn't a mcguire sosa thing happening guess what  baseball was gonna have a real tough time for many years to come certainly so baseball go fuck  yourselves look the other way and then put this boy in the uh hall of fame praise them and their  juicy juice fucking needles in their ass hell yeah it brought everyone back of course it did people 
[00:33:30]  started uh spending money on uh major league baseball and the ass is in the seats all right let me say  hi to jimmy in uh new jersey jimmy hey what's going on fellas hey brother i used to go to three rivers  all the time i watch the pirates as a kid barry bonds i know you can look at pictures and say wow  look how skinny he was compared to now but those guys like barry he was he was a lead-off hitter in  pittsburgh he used to jack so many home runs they had to move him further down in the lineup because  he was hitting walker uh lead-off home runs all the time and then and if anybody works out six days a 
[00:34:00]  week and eats right you can get jacked up these guys are already monsters they're six to six three  230 pounds you put on 15 pounds of muscle and you're going to look like a monster i'm not saying  they didn't do steroids but it's possible to actually get big like that it's possible but 20  years they take the shortcut yeah but jimmy the point i guess we were making earlier is when you see  the uh the uh pictures of barry bonds before the steroids you're looking at a very different human 
[00:34:30]  being and he's in the major leagues you're not looking at his high school uh picture yeah you  know you're most of these athletes are what they're going to be when they hit the majors  after all those years of working hard as a kid through high school through college  all right now like i said i'm not saying they didn't do steroids i agree his head is enormous  right now but like i said they were jacking homers when he was you know looking like a skinny dude 
[00:35:00]  dude i don't blame any i don't blame any of these guys it was the culture of the sport  they saw everybody doing it i don't know who was the first to bring it into the game but  they i don't blame these guys i thought andy paddick was the most honest when he said that he  just wanted to try to come back and i think a lot of these guys wanted to also even though it did  help him work out and stay and you know get a little bit thicker but his arm was hurting he had  to do some roids little roids andy paddick don't you uh yell at him all right thank you sir 
[00:35:30]  uh what else uh  they fall they fucking fall apart though after they're done  well when they when they get off the roids with that said this is a perfect call for them  dan dan in canada dan dan hey yeah there was a study done about 10 years ago that  asked over 100 olympic athletes if they could take a drug that would guarantee them olympic medal but  they died in five years 82 said they would oh yeah you gotta get that medal so there's your 
[00:36:00]  i mean ben johnson's either packing groceries or he's winning a gold medal and collecting 100 grand  200 grand a year yeah good old ben johnson whatever happened to ben johnson uh-huh uh he raced a horse  in a racing car about five years ago at a uh raceway you can't beat a racing car and you can't beat a  horse that's just stupid they start him out at different lengths and it's just so it's real  close it's real close but yeah they start the horse out like two feet from the finish line and 
[00:36:30]  the car is a mile back and they hit the horse's toes with a mallet before he starts running  stop it fuck up the horse stop it enough we're lame when it comes to animals  okay we need machines the whole world talks about michael phelps but put him in a fucking pool with a  dolphin dolphin yeah watch him look like an asshole right it's not even close no  dolphin could smoke pot too yeah yeah he'll still beat michael phelps blow blow fucking a bong right 
[00:37:00]  down the blow hole right get him all stoned and he'll still kick his ass who's that uh new guy  uve bolt or whatever oh yeah sprinter from uh uh jamaica yeah yeah get a cheetah get a greyhound  dog yeah i'm gonna have to hand nothing look at fucking uh jambi what happened to him after he got  off the juice he got then it was like yeah and he just sucked he was injured all the time 
[00:37:30]  fucks you up you can't do anything that you could have done uh uh while you were on the roids right  by the way steven s from basher i know horses don't have toes i just thought it might sound funnier  i was trying to go for the funny what is it a paw it's called a paw hoof a hoof a hoof here's part  it's a sin ma it's a sin here's part three of the mcguire thing does today feel better in some sense 
[00:38:00]  because at least you're unburdening  does today feel better in some sense because at least you're unburdening  i don't know i mean it's just uh i mean all i want to do is come clean

[00:43:00]  and prepared to talk about this i wanted to talk about this i wanted to get this off my chest you  would have said then what you've essentially said today absolutely i wish it never came into my life  but we're sitting here talking about it i'm so sorry that i have to i apologize to everybody in 
[00:43:30]  major league baseball wobble doodle my family  the maris's but see you like but see you like today was the hardest day of my life  yeah come on babe ruth come on the mick maybe the maris family because they've had a rough one  yeah well they you think they were watching on you fucking steroided motherfucker you fucked our dad 
[00:44:00]  he wasn't taking no dope i was probably taking something else though they always found  yeah they always found something shots maybe a little speed but that's the argument they always  use these these these athletes always found a little something something that helped them out  yeah to this day they're trying to find something something that's what they did people are taking  supplements thinking they're legal and then you know another year or two they'll find out that  particular supplements not legal anymore they're always actually always looking for a little 
[00:44:30]  a little juice a little edge i'd love to know what babe ruth was on though not a hint of a muscle on  that god that guy's body he had no muscle or anything it was all and he had more home runs than entire  teams booze and broads the hell was he doing yeah because the pitches were pretty much underhanding the  ball to him just to him though no to everybody then why was he hitting more homers home runs than  entire teams because he was a big fat fuck who had a little a lot of uh momentum behind him and he  he got good hand eye coordination i guess what why don't why doesn't anyone question that one 
[00:45:00]  wow are you gonna go back exhume his body and see if he's got roids in it you can look it up was  hitting more home runs than entire teams yeah what the fuck did he discover i think he was just that  good ah an athlete that much better than everybody else back then i mean it does happen from time to  time i i agree but he was drinking moxie we found out the babe was drinking moxie he probably was 
[00:45:30]  doing steroids he didn't even know yes he was eating african yo himbie bach right like what the  fuck what did they have but that's suspicious and what any one guy uh one guy hitting more home runs  than in an entire team yeah that's very suspicious no but he ran in fast motion that's true he did have  the fast motion every film i've seen of him he's fat but he runs in fast motion i can't they just  slow down the goddamn i don't know why that it is the digital age you just slow down the stupid tape  just looks silly now you watch a game in five minutes 
[00:46:00]  oh that's pretty good baseball should institute a designated juicer have one special guy on each  team do roids oh that'd be great man hey evan i just did your phone call for you i just want to  acknowledge that's a great little uh thought right there is this the babe you can take hockey rules  too there'll be no more bench clearings all right one guy gets plunked you send your juicer out they  send their juicer out they drop the mix they get it going on you can't get the genie back in the bottle 
[00:46:30]  it's perfect all right i kind of like it one juicer for each team thank you evan there goes the babe  round in the bases  yes babe ruth another home run for the babe as he rounds third headed for home he tips his hat to the  crowd and drinks another boxy and smokes a lucky strike and of course says derogatory things about 
[00:47:00]  negroes well as he gets a blow job in the dugout what a womanizer hubba hubba babe while negroes were  playing like in the middle of the woods somewhere yeah and had way better skills than babe ruth ever  a negro would never beat a white man in baseball right not the sultan of swat babe ruth there he is  not one negro in the stands not one negro on the field as babe ruth is running fast motion around the  base hitting another home run and running in fast motion there's the crowd all in top outs and suits 
[00:47:30]  waving on the babe there we go oh a negro's in the stands how did he get here we'll take care of  that i hope he's using the proper drinking fountain  stupid baby ruth yeah he is with his big fat gut how much fatter he is than everybody else  he's just a big pig we're just looking at old films of of the babe he's the bambino i think he's 
[00:48:00]  only like 28 there too there he is at the plate swinging away oh he takes time out to puff another  cigarette he had a big dumper didn't he oh he's a fat fucking pulling his pants up he had to pull his  pants up as he's batting and there he goes spinning around missed again another strike the count full on  the babe the pitch and there it goes the fat fuck running well waddling to first oh my god look how 
[00:48:30]  he runs how the fuck did you imagine that motherfucker having to slide into a base how the  fuck was he the best player in baseball he's winded taking his hat off there he goes that's a babe ruth  versus walter johnson yes time for another lucky strike mild on the throat right babe  that's right they'll cut your larynx out even young babe that's a little punch babe is all fat 
[00:49:00]  yeah the beginning of his paunch as a young player he didn't give a shit he's hitting the ball like a  motherfucker what a weird swing yeah man it was like effortless right the stadium just lobbing bats  around the ump is dressed in a suit with like barely a pad in front of him as you as you look at  all those people in the stands know this every single one of them is dead they're all dead every 
[00:49:30]  single one they look the same they're all wearing fedoras yeah they're all in white shirts a tie and  like a sports jacket the babe did you see that hit that thing was so out  and he re he like ran into it to hit the ball there he goes running in fast motion oh my god look at  the baby go it's amazing in fast motion he runs wow like a normal player does look at him go  he's on his bicycle oh he ran at the first and he's out face first into home plate that had to hurt 
[00:50:00]  my god  i didn't think i'd see that i'd sooner think i'd see a woman voting before i see him tagged out at home plate  everyone knows a broad's not smart enough to vote

[00:57:00]  yeah i did not see that that's all right i know that hey uh anthony for a couple days i've been  trying to explain this bob costas thing and why uh he really really bothers me and the best i can  come up with is that he tries to force moments yeah when when the event you're about to see on tv is  already pretty damn cool like the winter classic is a good example but then he has to force the moments 
[00:57:30]  with the pre pre uh the uh the pre-made package yeah the pre-recorded packages package talks about  how people used to play hockey in the charles river and now they're playing at fenway and blah blah  it's done with a lot of dramatic uh film work right and um dramatic music over the top dialogue yeah  music and it's written very hokey and and uh trying so hard to be profound well he's known for the 
[00:58:00]  pre-recorded packages to try to force the moment down your throat and that's why i don't like bob  costas and colin from atlanta thank you so much sir he sent us a clip it's on youtube um this goes back  to 93 it was when florida state played notre dame florida state was number one notre dame was number  two you don't need to push a moment that is a huge college football game huge and this is what 
[00:58:30]  bob costas did and it just hammers my point home listen to this  when summer is finally forgotten as daylight dwindles sooner each day look around the corner  just beyond main street chances are there's a game in a backyard children in the midst of imagining  oh uncle paul some with a notion innocent but powerful you eagerly followed your team listening 
[00:59:00]  to that distant voice you couldn't sleep after a victory couldn't wait till the day when it might be  your time and then that day arrived that moment that affirmation when you were told you were  special special of all the dramatic things i've ever seen before that day in the fall when all of  america would be watching you watching your team the kind of day dreamed of in a backyard just around the 
[00:59:30]  corner from main street you said that already god damn and then that is exactly the drivel that you were  talking about what about the kid that plays college football and it was a way out of the ghetto he doesn't  even know who his father is he didn't have a good field to play on on main street he had drug dealers 
[01:00:00]  trying to recruit him as he's just trying to play a game of football with his pals  on main street he tries to paint that picture you know even uses main street main just past main street  just past main street willoughby next stop willoughby  fucking crap shot it yeah great the dream the dream most kids have but most

[01:03:30]  it's branched off since then i i you know but that whole whiny thing yeah that whiny talk  she broke up with me yeah it's always about some chick that you can't get and so we understand  and it's a fag because he likes duran duran now that's that's not a nice statement it's called  nostalgia ass let's go to mike in delaware mike mike what do you say there boys hey what up mike 
[01:04:00]  uh not much i don't know i don't think the song is that bad but and i mean you like duran duran  that's just as bad as that hold on so do i i like duran duran give me a little give me a little  reflex the reflex no no no notorious notorious  you know something hungry like the wolf at least duran duran at the time was played duran duran 
[01:04:30]  at the time was played on rock radio and uh mtv and shit like that it was considered rock for some  reason it fit the time it was the the 80s this shit is like you know it might fit the time 
[01:05:00]  come on we're rocking out right all right maybe not all right turn this off this really does just  fucking torpedo my argument here's the question though name the most rocking duran duran song  girls on film no hungry like the wolf  the most rocking wow that's a tough one wow where they're just rocking  say duran duran they're in full rock mode wild boys wild boys no what about their james bond theme 
[01:05:30]  they did a james bond song that one um rocks rocked right view to a kill view to a kill to that  yeah yeah yeah that one rock did it come on  view to a kill rock 
[01:06:00]  can we hear a view to a kill rock in this  come on  travis  we don't have it you got it there danny's got it  come on come on come on this is fucking rocking now  look at the video futuristic  these special effects aren't very special 
[01:06:30]  i love when these videos back then when they were uh movie soundtrack videos and they incorporated the  band into the movie like it's james bond on the eiffel tower right from the movie and then they 
[01:07:00]  have like simon lebon on the eiffel tower doing some secret agent  shit he's too busy singing while james bond is shooting at him yeah how's that gonna work out for you  duran duran might have started the whining thing  yeah we're gonna dance into the fire  of course we are  of course we are 
[01:07:30]  yeah  come on rock  no  guess not  all right look at look at his big recorder what if he got this video is stupid  a helicopter  right  all right we can watch videos all day  special effects are all right so maybe duran duran doesn't rock as 
[01:08:00]  no as we thought  but uh but compared to this  shit  hold on man someone's gonna argue uh hungry like the wolf for us though eric in staten island  hungry like the wolf  i don't know if you guys remember but  hungry like the wolf was used in the blowjob scene where andy dick is teaching all those girls  had to blow a guy and will fowl comes in and beats the shit out of him hungry like the wolf is  playing in the background yeah and old school okay yeah all right there you go you like the  world duran's cool girls on film rio right oh yeah yeah yeah all right here's kenny doing 
[01:08:30]  fireflies  and now the opi and anthony show presents club soda kenny sings the hits  owl city fireflies  you would not believe your eyes if ten million fireflies lit up the world as i jerked off 
[01:09:00]  cause they fill the open air  and leave my sperm everywhere  you'd think me rude but i would just stand and stare  i'd like to make myself believe 
[01:09:30]  that planet earth turns slowly  it's hard to say that i'd rather stay awake while i'm asleep  cause everything is never as it seems  just jerk me off  cause i get a thousand tugs from ten thousand lightning bugs  as they try to teach me how to jerk 
[01:10:00]  a fox trot above my head  a condom beneath my bed  a disco ball is just hanging by a thread  i'd like to make myself believe  that planet earth turns slowly  it's hard to say that i'd rather stay awake while i'm asleep  everything wasn't never as it seems  when i fall asleep 
[01:10:30]  this has been club soda kenny sings the hits  wow for the opi and anthony show  they did a pretty good job with your raw audio kenny  the auto tuning is uh fantastic it's a hit  kenny auto tune fucking rules that's sarah in buffalo  yep that is  and steven s from bayshore i love tardo tuned kenny  yeah they were calling it auto buffoon  kevin from connecticut shut up kenny you auto tuning son of a 
[01:11:00]  bitch  yeah oh right on you like that kenny you like that version  yeah were you happy with what they did with your uh vocal style  on your producer i i could be an actual singer now  you could with the auto tune anyone can that's all they do they get some  fucking kid that it's like the johnny bravo thing yes  get some kid that that has that look that they're looking for and then you  fucking make them look cool in a studio  so what's going on out there every note 
[01:11:30]  yeah no i gotta thank everybody behind the scenes for making that nice no you  don't you really don't i don't i'm gonna i don't yeah who do you want to thank first no no i don't  who do you want to thank well you know sam and and troy kwan is well sam's right outside  the the studio sam oh  sam here he comes  with his feet sam the final product uh came out good yes and we do have to give a lot of credit to 
[01:12:00]  technical supervisor and producer troy kwan he is the uh the pro tools master of that song  apparently so yes he was able to make it uh sound a lot like the original the auto tuning uh  uh wow kenny's voice he worked until all hours of the night because they refused to give him a pro  tool set up here so he had to go home and work all hours of the night he's got it home yeah and  why couldn't he do it here because they won't give him a pro tool set up at his desk why they just 
[01:12:30]  won't why they won't why because they won't do it but why why are they still making things  complicated in the year 2010 he could do it at his desk no why can't he do it at his desk he has to  put in a full day's work doing what that would be working east street radio what east street radio  what does he do for east street radio i don't know but i don't like it but i think they're trying  to wean troy away from the show oh boy i don't like it i i don't like that one bit 
[01:13:00]  oh boy what does he do for east street radio he's got a like here's springsteen 1978 at the  coliseum you throw it on the fucking channel you're done he's got to load all the songs and  he's got to call people at home because sometimes they have a show called you're the boss no be the  boss be the boss i get it right what is be the boss it's where you get to be you get to pick your  favorite just walk around and act like an asshole and give people horrible ideas no oh i don't know  what that implies oh i thought that was be the boss yeah nothing but pleasantries pleasantries 
[01:13:30]  right anthony i'm sorry pleasant pleasantries no no that's that's within the realm of pleasantries  trust me of course the boss refers to bruce springsteen and you get to pick which show  what you get to wear those awful designer glasses and some goofy tie and think you're  fucking hip and cool and know what you're doing in radio no no i don't know what that means either  that's be the boss yeah be the boss no springsteen is be the boss where you promise someone a raise  and a year and a half later they're still fighting for their raise i really don't know what that means 
[01:14:00]  but pleasantries nothing but pleasantry that means oh i got it it's just when a show comes up with an  idea you do everything in your power to undermine it and turn it into a lump of shit and then say i'm  here for you guys i'm here to make make you better is that it that has nothing to do with what's  going on is that what troy kwan's doing now is it no no troy kwan is be the boss is uh oh you know  and speaking of bosses the boss gave me two more songs to sing because he knows oh really what songs 
[01:14:30]  yeah yeah what songs in production right now well we haven't laid down the tracks i'll give you a  little hint there's party in the usa that's not a hint that's the name of the song some hint  you gotta sing miley cyrus nice hint yeah and then then we're gonna go for a rock vibe yeah but  we can't blow off the auto-tuning thing kenny auto-tuning i know you really need a lot i thought 
[01:15:00]  i hated auto-tuning until i just heard that i know it's now i just now i just want kenny auto-tuning  all day long i don't even want him on the radio unless he's unless he's in auto-tune we got our next  song then what is it down down i think it's by uh i don't know jay sean ah fuck it's all auto-tune  it's great that's that black shit it's not it's on hits one it's on the same i don't know that black  shit although i have nothing about it it's a big pop song i did admit that i i listened to that old  school classic hip-hop channel me too gh yeah what number is it i just find it a while it's like i think 
[01:15:30]  64 on xm yeah they do a bunch of hippity hop type songs you like that yeah hippity hippity hippity  hippity hoobity all right so all cities was a hit there's another one in front of us you want to  blow out the other song too we might as well because lady gaga oh shit it doesn't have an auto-tune  but it is affected it is affected lady gaga becomes the first artist with five straight number one

[01:19:00]  anything about the groupie thing because he's in a serious relationship yeah but he could have talked  about the uh old days past he wrote a book about it or his thing buy the book or his finger  fucking broads in columbus buy it a book look at jimmy that blonde looks very familiar it's a model  who is she let me see we've seen her before dude oh yeah she looks very familiar oh yeah who that is  uh yeah i don't know i don't know either but all right looks good for jimmy that's in the paper

In the morning  Well, it's supposed to be funny around the clock  It's like the mashup

[01:36:00]  I'll be right back  Yeah, yeah  I did the  I'm going to the bathroom  And just fucking left  And then we had to sprint for freedom  Across their front lawn  Yeah  And run to a vehicle  And just peel out  That was running  Oh, there was a tent in the back  Where there was coolers full of beer  So I spent some time there  And then Opie came out  And was like  Anthony, you might come in  I'm sitting alone with some fucking old broad  Remember, you're like  Could you just come in?  Help me out  This is from  Some old fucking ass 
[01:36:30]  Trying to get me up stairs  For some fucking  Some fucking blowjob or something  I don't even know  Who the fuck knows  That was terrible  That was horrendous  TV contest  Well, we got everyone checking in  It's the Virus Breakfast Show  We got Adam and Jersey  Hey, how you doing?

[01:37:00]  Oh, wait  Let's say how to Bill in Pittsburgh  Bill  Hey, I just want to let you guys know  If you go down further on the contest page  They have a big paragraph  Itemizing with each station  What the winner gets  And it makes it sound real glorious  About hotel accommodations  Just thought you guys might want to check it out  Touchdown  I don't even know about this promotion  I know  Have you said yes to this one?  No, I mean, I'm saying  At least the bosses know you  I gotta walk slower to the elevator  Because I think I'm saying yes to shit  Well  But at least they know you 
[01:37:30]  So you think it over for a split second  They know you guys well enough  To not bother pitching you things  Where it's like you would actually  Have to interact with the winner  Yeah, that is true  They're not going to ask  If you let him on the air  They're not going to ask  If you have breakfast with him  Go out and have a breakfast with him  Yeah, or go to a movie or something  Look, will you just meet a guy if he wins?  Yeah, could you just pass by him?  Top rated virus breakfast show  Oh, man  Virus breakfast show  And that is why, my friend  You don't have to wonder anymore 
[01:38:00]  I don't even care  I don't want to be hanging with anyone  That thinks the top rated virus breakfast show  Is a way to explain the Opie and Anthony program  Opie and Anthony show  We're the top rated virus breakfast show  Top rated  We're the only virus breakfast show  So that doesn't even make sense  That's true  That doesn't even make sense  Because we're the only one  Yeah  We're not the top rated virus lunch show  Which is Ron and Fez  Top rated show on the virus  But we don't even go with that shit  Because we're all pals here on this channel

[01:41:00]  Opie and Anthony  William Shatner's gonna be on  In a few minutes here  Yeah  I got the Blu-ray collection  Ooh  Including six motion pictures  Featuring Kirk and Spock  Very cool  All of the, uh  I guess, yeah  Did I see that?  No  Why?  Because you'll break it  You'll break it  Why would I break it?  I want him to sign it right there  To my good friend 
[01:41:30]  On the plastic?  No, I'll take the plastic off  Yep  Uh, William is a  Is a fine guest  Bob Kelly in studio  I call him Bill  Bill Shatner  Good old Billy Boy  Bill Shatner  Billy Boy  Billy Boy  You know what I gotta ask him  Because I don't understand this  Huh  In a couple of the movies  Um  Including the  Are you gonna go deep with the interview?  Oh yeah  Mmhmm  I always do  I know you do  I'm a big Star Trek fan  And he hates  When all I do 
[01:42:00]  Is dwell on Star Trek  Anthony knows more about  Star Trek  Than what he does  Yeah  He brings up stuff  And he goes  Did that happen?  And it's like  Yes it did  Now uh  What I don't understand  Obviously  The new movie  Uh  They had problems  Fitting him in  Storyline problems  Things like that  Whatever it was  But  His outfit  Yeah  But  The  The thing I don't understand  Is  Spock  Uh  Leonard Nimoy  Has been doing the 
[01:42:30]  End narration  For a couple of movies  You know  Space  The Final Frontier  These are the voyages  Of the Starship Enterprise  Blah blah blah blah blah  Why didn't they get  Shatner  To at least do the  Narration at the  End of the  New movie  Like that would have  At least been  Kind of cool  That would have been  Great  Instead of having  Uh  Leonard Nimoy do it  Well I hear Shatner's  Really hard to work with  I hear he's a  Fucking insufferable  Prick to work with  That's what I've heard too  Just ask fucking 
[01:43:00]  Sulu  Sulu wanted uh  Nothing to do with him  Well  Maybe not uh  In that sense  Wow  Yes I kept it  Oh  Yeah  Well we're gonna have to ask him  Cause I don't think  We've had him on  Since uh  The whole Star Trek  Uh  J.J. Abrams thing  Happened  No  Bob Kelly in studio  What's up  Sorry it's the breakfast show  So I'm having a little breakfast  Yeah yeah  We figure we eat  During the breakfast show  Now it makes sense  We could eat  During the show 
[01:43:30]  It makes sense now  Bobby  What do we got Bobby  Bananas Comedy Club  Hasbrook Heights  New Jersey  Yeah  That's January 22nd  And 23rd  And the big show  Down there at the  Trump Taj Mahal  With Patrice  Oh  With Patrice  March 6th  Damn that's a good show  We're going to Atlantic City  This weekend  And I think the next time  I'll go to Atlantic City  Will be  Saturday March 6th  To see Bob Kelly  And Patrice  Wow  The tickets are on sale  And more info  At Trump  Taj  That's T-A-J 
[01:44:00]  Dot com  Trump  T-A-J  Dot com  Jimmy twittered  That uh  That his uh  Borgata shows  Are sold out  Nice  And then I just  I retweeted it  And twittered  That's because  I said  I was going  Nice  Just give him  A little fucking  Taste of reality  Because the second  We all jumped  On that bandwagon  Said we were all  Going down there  And it was confirmed  Yeah  And he sells out  That's the weirdest thing  Because you guys  Are coming to Bananas 
[01:44:30]  In Hasbro Heights  Of course  I wouldn't miss it  I don't understand why  It's like a crazy  Little hotel gig  Yeah why not  You know  It's amazing  It's Bananas in a hotel  It's uh  It's one of  Yeah Bananas  The club's name  Bananas  There's actually a  Banana on the stage  I know  With a monkey  Why would they  We beat them up  For that  They have a  But every week  They have to put  Real bananas  Up on top  Like someone has to  Go and buy  A bushel of bananas  Probably very important  That they do that  Where are the bananas  Like they probably  Get mad when they're 
[01:45:00]  Not there  Someone got yelled at  For not getting bananas  He gets fired  Hey William Shatner  Just announced  That he's going to  Be on the ONA show  Um  I think  I think we give him  The big intro man  You want Kenny  To do the over the top  Intro  For William Shatner  Of course  Kenny  Oh my god  He just stopped  On a dime  Kenny  We want  William Shatner  To feel very comfortable  On the OPN Anthony show  Okay  I don't know  If he's here yet  Is he here yet  I was just going  To get him  Oh yeah  Oh  But I want  Could someone else  Get him  Because I want you 
[01:45:30]  To do the over the top  William Shatner  Here he is  Intro  And make him feel  Very comfortable  By introducing him  Yeah  Even Kenny  That would be  Uncomfortable  Yeah like  I could like  Hold the door open  For him  And pull out his chair  And like  Oh we don't want  He's a legend  We don't want him  Just walking in here  Open it up  I'm going to get it  For you  Pull out the  Nine knives you have  In your pocket  If you don't want to  That's fine  I know what to do  Shoot it  Hey Anthony  We promised this  William Shatner

[01:49:00]  Bill Shatner  Yes  It's a lot more comfy that way  The Opie and Anthony show  Yes  That's Bob Kelly  Hi buddy  How are you  Nice to meet you  Wow  What success you are having  With your talk show  And who knew  Who knew  Who knew you could talk  After years on this show  Yeah  I don't think anyone  Questioned that  Bill Shatner could talk  But the thing is  The caliber of guests  You're getting  Isn't that something  And the  What they're coming out with 
[01:49:30]  How you're  Drawing stuff out of them  I know  What do you attribute that to  Why do people feel  They can open up  To William Shatner  I'm reading the way  You said William Shatner  I'm just saying  It doesn't seem like  And there was a  You know  It wasn't totally  Discounted  You know  But there was a  Discounting  A note of  Sort of  Like  William Shatner  I don't think  I took that to the extreme  Right  It wasn't quite that  But it was like 
[01:50:00]  William Shatner  Like we're all surprised  You know what it is  But surprised  In a  I'm trying to find the right word  In a kind of like  How  Could this idiot do it  Believe me  It's a compliment  Because I'm talking about  You know  Barbara Walters  Everybody that's been  Doing the interviews  For years and stuff  And you're pretty new  To the interview scene  Like that  And you're drawing  A lot out of  Your guests  The  The  The  The key for me  Is that you guys 
[01:50:30]  Because you're on the air  You need a story  You need something  To happen right now  Oh yeah  You can't  Have somebody dawdle  And say well  What do you mean  You want to go back over that  Or  But because we film  We're able to edit  And so  I don't want  The tabloid story  I  I stay away  From the tabloid  Story  Whoever's there  Whoever comes on the show  And right now  It's  They're all personalities  Because  We  And celebrities  Because we  Want to get 
[01:51:00]  The show known  And we're entering  Our third season  Third  Wow  Thirteen week cycle  And  And the show  Slowly  Getting  Known  Yeah  Absolutely  Might catch it  We  I don't  I don't want  A tabloid story  I want  Something coming  From the people  Yeah  From the person  They're  A little piece  Of their life  Piece of their life  Anything  Anything  Walking down the street 
[01:51:30]  What  Caught a glimpse  Of something  What did you see  And why did you see it  And what does it mean to you  And in its minutia  You get a  A look at the  Personality  For more insight  A more  More insightful look  Into a personality  That you didn't have  22 minutes ago  Did  Did people  Kind of go like  And don't take this  The wrong way  Again  I'll take it the way  You mean it  Did people  Kind of say like 
[01:52:00]  Bill Shatner  Wants to do a talk show  I remember  We didn't give it a shot  At the time  After William  Came in  We're like  Oh come on  How long will this last  Did you really  No no  We knew it would work  Well I didn't  And I didn't know  What I was doing  I'd forgotten  Whether I instigated it  Or who instigated  The idea  Of a talk show  But then I met  With the A&E people  And the bio people  And we sat around  And started talking  And  What I said  I guess made sense 
[01:52:30]  To  The people who  Do the hiring  How did you pitch it  As far as it being  Different than  You know  Letterman  I didn't know  I didn't know  What to do  And I kept saying  It's a good pitch  I don't know  What to do  Alright we'll give you  A show  I said I don't know  How to make  At the beginning  Excuse me  I didn't know  How to make it  Different  And what the  What the world  Doesn't need  Is another talk show  Then I had 
[01:53:00]  An insight  Which was  Raw nerve  I'll look for  A raw nerve  That touched  Their nerve  And they said  That sounds good  To us  So I named it  Raw nerve  On all these  Interview shows  Of which I've done  So many  Like we're doing  Right now  We're seated  Ten feet apart  Yeah  I barely can see  Your eyes  Right right  And I've always  Wondered  Why do  The shows 
[01:53:30]  Like the  Tonight show  Have a desk  And the seat  Where you're  Seated  Not even  Looking at the  Person  You're  You're off  To the right  Side  You're 90 degrees  Away  You've got to  Crane your neck  To look at the  Person you're  Talking to  And your seat's  A little lower  Than the host seat  Putting him in a  Power position  For real  No no  That stuff goes down  I thought  What I want  And I  And on the  First shows  I put two  Chairs together  So that  It would be like  You're having  Dinner  With someone 
[01:54:00]  And it's a  Small table  And you're  Leaning across  And saying  Tell me about it  Yeah the chair  Got a lot of  Publicity  Because it is  So unique  Yeah so  I was looking  For that  Intimate thing  And we know  About the bubble  Of  Respect  Or distance  In European  Culture  In Middle  Eastern culture  It's much  Closer  They talk  Into your ear  But here  It's about  Foot and a half  About 18 inches 
[01:54:30]  Away  You're  Verging on  The intimate  But not  Inserting yourself  Into their  Into their  Area  Yeah  So that's  The distance  I wanted to be  Just on the edge  Of not making  Them uncomfortable  But being able  To see the blink  And the  And the iris  And the  And the  Nonverbal exchange  As well  Now still on the chair  Can you  Hit red alert  Or jettison the pod  Well  If they're not funny  And they don't have  A good story  Out they go 
[01:55:00]  Through the chair  Jettison the pod  And there they go  Who was your  Favorite guest  And why  So far  Probably a hat  Question  I've thought about  That quite a bit  And I've had  26 people on now  We're going to  Our next 13  And I cannot  Tell you  Who would have  Been my favorite  Because everybody  For one reason  Or another  Has come up  With an insight  Into that  Into their  Into their  Personality  That is not  Ugly  That is not 
[01:55:30]  Demeaning  That is not  Raucous  It's just  It's an  Aha moment  Of wow  I didn't know  I didn't know  That person  As well  And another  Interesting thing  Happens  As might happen  If you had  A dinner  With a stranger  But you had  A moment of meeting  And you stand up  To say goodbye  And you kind of  Want to touch  And you hug  And you say goodbye  Almost every single  One of those people  Have stood up  After we've cut 
[01:56:00]  And said  Wow that was  An experience  I've never  I've never had  Anything like that  Happen  And hug me  And say  We must meet again  That's  And I would  Gather you're  Getting a lot of  Because you get  You know  A-listers on there  And stuff  How are they  Booked  Do they  Approach you  Guys  And go like  Yeah  And that's  Another whole  Skill isn't  It  I mean  You face  That day  In and day  Out  How can  You get 
[01:56:30]  Who's coming  Into town  What are they  Promoting  And that kind  Of thing  And can you  Book them  On your show  And get them  And enough  Of a name  So that people  Listening to radio  Will  Well I think  We can learn  From William  Shatnerant  Because he  Talks about  How they hug  After each interview  In our case  Most of the guests  Flee  They run  For their lives  And then we  Don't understand  Why they won't  Come back  Maybe we just  Need to be nicer  To these guys  Only people  Who suffer  Love the suffering  Come back  Like myself  Lashed  But the booking 
[01:57:00]  Of the guests  Is a real skill  And for the longest  Time I've relied  On me  Many times  Calling personally  And saying  Yeah  I'd love to have  You on  If I don't know  Them  I know about them  And they know  A little bit  About me  Well a little bit  That's another thing  I wanted to touch  On also  It's when  When you see  Letterman or Leno  And stuff like that  They're known  From being a talk  Show host  Right  And that's what  They do  You on the other hand 
[01:57:30]  Are an icon  From television  And movies  So I would  I would  Gather that  The guests  Themselves  Are a little  Do you find  That they're a little  Starstruck  Sitting there  With you  Sometimes  They're  At least  Respectful  The thing  That Letterman  And Leno  Have  Are  The numbers  Of people watching  So that  If you're in a movie  And the publicist  Wants  To book you 
[01:58:00]  On the show  There's a reason  To do that  My show  Will not  Bring in  The box office  Audience  As much as  These other talks  Or your talk show  For that  Matter  I mean  I'm here  Saying  Watch  Raw Nerve  On bio channel  At  Tuesdays  But they repeat  The show  So you can see it  Almost every day  Of the week  I'm on here  Publicizing my show  To get publicity  From you  So I don't have 
[01:58:30]  That advantage  All I offer  Is  A few minutes  Of conversation  That might be  Fun to do  You know what it is  That's almost  A double edged sword  That you  Might have more  Difficulty  Getting a guest  That really wants  To promote something  But then you don't  Have to worry about  That they're just there  To plug their  Product  And you can get  A little more  Out of them  Again  Having  Had the experience  Of being on  A Letterman show  And knowing  I've got a record 
[01:59:00]  I want to plug  I've got this show  Raw Nerve  I want to plug  And I've got to tell  Them a funny story  All in  Four and a half minutes  Right  Right  And if Letterman  Is going to help  Or hinder  Because sometimes  They get a  B  Where the bees  Don't fly  Because  I don't know why  So you're not  Going to go there  You can't get there  And it's  And prior to going on  It's a moment  Of tension  You're performing  An ad-lib situation 
[01:59:30]  In which you've got  To be amusing  If not outright funny  Get the message  Across that you're  There to do  Leave on good enough  Terms that they'll  Ask you back  In six months  When you're promoting  Something else  And continue on  And you've got to be  You've got to be  You've got to make it  With some import  And that's a tough one  To do  On my show  You don't have to do that  I'll promote  Whatever you're promoting  We'll announce  At the beginning  And the end  Don't worry about  The promotion  I'll get 
[02:00:00]  Whatever you want  To promote  I'll have the announcer  I'll have the people  I'll do it  And then you'll get  Genuine discussion  And then you just  Want to discuss  Relax  I don't want a funny story  Don't think about  Inventing something  That happened the other day  Let's talk about you  And  Very cool  Bill leaned forward  True story  True story  Let me tell you  All right  No we don't need that  Thank you very much  I want to talk to you  A little bit about  The J.J. Abrams  Star Trek  That came out  Yeah  A lot of people 
[02:00:30]  Have been saying  Why weren't you in it  I said the same thing  I promoted that guy  There was  Some kind of  Controversy  Where you were  Supposed to be in it  And I just brought up  The fact that  In the past couple  Of movies  Or the last few movies  That you guys were in  Leonard Nimoy  Did the ending  Space  The Final Frontier  Speech  Instead of you  Now I would think  That would have been  A perfect thing 
[02:01:00]  For you to be involved  With in that movie  Is just to give  That final  You know  Everybody's got this  I don't know  What the word is  Obtuse  Thought  That they've got to  Follow through  The history  Like  No they did that  They said yes  Over  Six shows ago  So they can't say no  Two shows from  It's crazy  Who remembers  Go be amusing 
[02:01:30]  And dramatic  And go have a good time  And entertain  And don't worry  About the necessary history  There are some  Aficionados  Who say oh yeah  But he didn't say that  And he wouldn't have  Of course  But what you want to be  Which is what J.J. did  Is entertaining  Yeah  You saw the movie  And  No I have not seen  You haven't seen it  No  I haven't seen the movie  Is there a reason you haven't  The real reason  Is I haven't had time  I haven't been in a movie theater 
[02:02:00]  In two years  Yeah  I have a wonderful  Room  With a large screen  Yes  Indeed  So do I Mr. Shatner  It's wonderful  And somebody gave me  As a birthday present  Not so long ago  A popcorn machine  Now I can make my own popcorn  It's wonderful  It's got that too  So  I've got popcorn  On a large screen  And I've watched movies there  About two or three years  After they've been released  And I say  Did you see  I'm a little behind  Jesus  Shatner's way behind 
[02:02:30]  On the movie  I'm way behind  So the real reason is  I haven't had time  Yeah  The second reason is  I sort of wonder  What I'll feel  When I do see it  That was what I really wanted  To get into  Because I think that would be  Interesting  You being  Captain Kirk  I mean that's  You're synonymous  With Captain Kirk  And then  Here's this new kid  Playing the younger version  Exactly  And then seeing  Somebody playing  A younger version  Yeah  Already  That's like  Oh yeah  That's right  I'm old  I mean whenever I think 
[02:03:00]  About my age  I think that can't be true  That's some  Other world  Yeah  Because I don't feel that  Oh that guy  Playing mean younger  Same guy  I mean  Yeah  So  Yeah  Interesting  And then there's a third thing  And that is  Mr. Abrams has said  That he'd set up a screening  At Paramount  For me  At this screening room  That I used to go to  All the time  And when I was at Paramount  I thought  What fun  Have a private screening  Of the movie  We'll get it catered  I'll invite  20, 30 people  I have Monday night football 
[02:03:30]  At my house  Well I'm not working  On Monday night  I'd be happy to  You fly in  You're invited  And so  Get the Monday night football crowd  Bring them all there  Bring them hot dogs  And popcorn and stuff  And watch the movie  In a private screening  What fun that would be  So that's going to happen  The next few weeks  Oh really  Okay  So you will see the movie  God I would love to know  Yeah  I don't want to skip over  The football thing  Who's your team  Well 
[02:04:00]  I live in Los Angeles  And we  Curse the day  That we don't have a team  A  And B  The teams that now  Lo these many years  Have left  So whenever the Raiders play  And whenever the Rams play  I give them my curse  And it's worked  But now I'm running out of emotion  You know  It's been so long  Like an old lover  That left you  Oh right  Where are you from originally?  You're not from  I'm from Montreal  So that makes it rough  Yeah  Happy times  That Canadian football  Just doesn't get the job done 
[02:04:30]  Does it?  Nah  It doesn't seem to have the publicity  Although it can be quite exciting  And it gets a job done  For the Canadians  True  True  But we're down here  And we're looking for the  Super Bowl  Anyway  So my wife's from Indianapolis  And I love  Manning  The wisdom of  Of a guy  That's played a long time  His ability to  Pick the defenses  So I'm with the Colts  Do you think they should  Have won for the undefeated season?  Yes  I cannot believe  What kind of a mind 
[02:05:00]  No really  I mean  There's more prestige  There's more aura  About having an undefeated season  Than winning the Super Bowl  And you can't play  You can't play scared at that point  No  You have no choice  You've got to go for the undefeated season  And you have the spirit of your guys  Manning obviously wanted to do it  And to me  The coach saving  I wanted  One more quarter  The Patriots did that  And they lost  Wes Welker  And now they're out of the Super Bowl  And now they're out of the thing 
[02:05:30]  You know what though  They won three Super Bowls  They lost Wes Welker  For the year  I mean that means next year  They're not going to be a good team  Whatever  What do you mean whatever  It's football  You've got to go for it  Exactly  I think the Colts  Men's with the boxing  You go for it  But the mystique  Of going for it  Right  Mystique of saying  Let's chance  Yes  Our guys  Because it's a rough game anyway  Yeah  And we're going  We're going for the  Undefeated  I cannot believe that  Thank you  It's not like they're 10 and 4  It's like alright  Let's wrestle some guys 
[02:06:00]  Getting ready for the playoffs  You're still undefeated  Undefeated  And you might go 17 games  Nobody's ever done it  I think you mess with  The football gods too  I say the Colts  Do not win  Me and Bill Shatner  Yep  I agree with you  This so reminds me  Of the Gamesters of Triskelion  Now  Obviously the Thralls  Now you went for it  And I have no memory of that  I know the name  But I have no memory  Of the plot  Bill went for it  He didn't  And there was no  Undefeated 
[02:06:30]  You had to be undefeated  Or you were gone  Yeah  One mistake  Is that a real storyline  And it's  Characters of Triskelion  Triskelion  With the Thralls  They had things around their neck  Stop it Bobby  Mr. Shatner  Mr. Shatner  You can't appear ignorant  When we were setting up  You know  Your fine visit here  I told everyone  That Ant knows more about  Star Trek than you  I know nothing about  So anything Antony knows  Is more than I know  Yeah  Oh that one  The episode of Mythbusters 
[02:07:00]  Yes  Where  That was the one  Where James T. Kirk  Was battling the Gorn  On the planet  Now the Gorn  I remember  Yes  Because it was one  Of the first shows  And that was the  Rubber suited  Gorn  Creature  And I had to make dynamite  Yes  You made it out of  A little piece of bamboo  And some rope  And you used sulfur  And charcoal  And diamonds  Yeah  And I guess they did it  On Mythbusters  What happened Danny  Did it work?  They did  They were able to fire  Like something  I mean it wasn't enough  To kill you  To kill the other person 
[02:07:30]  Most likely  Everything would have  Blown out the other side  Of it  Yeah but the Gorns  That'll kill a Gorn  That's all you have to do  Is kill a Gorn  Well no no  It would have came out  The side that you were  Firing from  No you don't understand  The Gorn surrounds it  In that way  The Gorns  Are not just  Ordinary lizards  I'm not familiar  With the Gorn  Oh please  I am  Come on  Very familiar  I don't understand  The Gorn walks so slow  Yet you were always  He was right near you  Well it looked slow 
[02:08:00]  But he covered  Long distances  With his threads  At least I get an answer  Now right from the source  That's right  Which is good  Which is real good  And the guy was so hot  Inside  I don't doubt it  Right  That big rubber suit  In the middle  Of the summer  Where did you guys  Do the outdoor  Planet  There is the  San Andreas Fault  That goes about  40 or 50 miles  Outside of Los Angeles  Streaks across  I think most of California 
[02:08:30]  And it's filled with boulders  And it's ominous looking  Because it is  The north plate  And the south  Two plates  Are butting out there  You don't want any  Butting plates  Around anywhere  You're there  And that's where we go  Wow  That's where it was  And you guys were  Climbing up those rocks  Oh yeah  Yourself  That was not special effects  No  No  The only special effects  Well where it wasn't quite you  Was when you were always  Fighting yourself  And it was like  Who is that guy 
[02:09:00]  He's fighting  From the back  That was me  Oh yeah  No  But the other guy  No that was me  You fought yourself  Absolutely  How many times  Absolutely  How many times  Have you argued with yourself  I want him on the show  I don't want him on the show  Yeah that's true  Have you had that  Should he have gone  For the  For the  The season  Or the season  I  I mean it's an argument  The guy must have  He was arguing with himself  That was mental  But  So why can't you do it physically  Well when I argued with myself  It wasn't with a guy 
[02:09:30]  That had a little bit longer hair  Might have been a little bigger than me  And  Longer reach  You're saying the stunt double was awful  Sometimes  Especially in engineering  When they had that long shot  You could really kind of see  What was going on  A lot of wasted space  On the Enterprise too  They should have ran some pipes up there  Or something  That's the Gorn  See  No that's a mascot  What team is he a mascot for Bill  That's not a mascot  Why are you fighting mascots  That's the Gorn  That's the coach 
[02:10:00]  Of the Colts  What do you mean  We should have gone for the season  My ex-girlfriend would always say  Watching Star Trek  She'd be like  That William Shatner  Is beautiful  She would call you beautiful  I was beautiful  You were a very attractive man  He's still a good looking guy  No no  Attractive doesn't make it  Beautiful  Beautiful  Beautiful makes it  I was beautiful  Look at that  Right  Throwing rocks  Look at  See that  You hit him dead center  And nothing happened  And this is on radio  And they don't know you're watching  We watch TV all the time  On the radio 
[02:10:30]  We paint the pictures  Bill somehow  We just threw a styrofoam  Is your radio audience wondering  What the heck  Are we talking about  We're watching a Star Trek episode  Go screw yourself  That's what I say to the audience  Maybe you ought to interview the Gorn  And find out where he is  In this day  I wonder  Sit in that chair  I don't know who the guy  The Gorn was  Translator  Can you imagine  The Gorn is like a famous  Star Trek character  Yes  And there's a guy  Walking around  Maybe no longer alive  But  I was the Gorn  I was the Gorn  And people go  Oh really  Yeah  They would say Gorn 
[02:11:00]  Well we should tell them  When we interviewed  The guys from Star Wars  We got some exclusive interviews  Oh the guys in the suits  We got the guys in the suits  All the guys in the suits  That's what we get  That's what we get  Oh that's what you booked  Yeah  The guys in the suits  But the guys who went out  The suits  Went on Letterman  Yeah  We didn't get those guys  And they were so proud  To be the guys in the suits  We don't know  We don't know if they were  The actual guys  Well that's true  Right  You could have a guy  In the suit  Of a phony  Yes  That's what I was saying  It could be anybody 
[02:11:30]  I was  I was actually  I wanted to be in Star Wars  So much  I was one of the guys  You're one of the guys  You might as well say it  In the suits  Right  You were the guy in the suit  Yeah I was the guy in the suit  Any awkward moments  With the interview show  Going back to that  Any awkward moments  No  People are asking us  To ask you about  Gene Simmons  And I did not see that episode  And I'm sorry  Gene Simmons  Gene Simmons  With this makeup  And this tongue  And the singing  Casts a shadow 
[02:12:00]  I mean you think  Oh my god  He's a weird guy  Yeah  Turns out  That Gene  Is a Holocaust  His mother is a Holocaust survivor  They went to live in  Dirt poor  Dirt poor  Dirt on the floor poor  Circumstances in Israel  Until he was about  Ten or twelve  Came here  Wasn't quite dirt poor  But was poor  Mother 
[02:12:30]  Survived  By working  He lived in such  Dire circumstances  That this child  Began to  Look for ways  To survive  And miraculously  Picks up a guitar  And  Thinks about  What will make  A character  The story of  Gene Simmons  Is so touching  About somebody 
[02:13:00]  Who is in survival mode  The whole time  And even now  But not even now  All his life  He's in survival mode  We've had Gene on  Many times  We didn't get that out of him  He was too busy  Plugging everything  He was too busy  Trying to pick up  My girlfriend  At the time too  Yeah he was trying  To pick up  Ann's girlfriend  He was plugging  Did he  I don't know  I'll tell you the truth  Has she stood your girlfriend  Nah  Now there's another problem  Traffic girl over  10 or 11  Is your girlfriend now 
[02:13:30]  Well she was  Well you want to tell  Bill the story  No tell me the story  It's a good story  This is a good story  Tell you're on the show  Right now  What's Gene doing  What is your girlfriend  Doing on the show  While Gene's on  Well she was doing  The interview  You might have  Because she's the weather  She's the traffic girl  And sometimes the interview girl  This is going back  Like you know  A year and a half  She's on TV right now  Bill  We might see  Oh yeah  I'd love to  But  Have you got a telephone number  And then  I don't think  I'll be sending  Any texts  After what happened  It was a terrific ending 
[02:14:00]  To this relationship  You might want to ask him about it  It was a whirlwind romance  That lasted an entire summer  A couple of years ago  And we had a very good time  And everything  It was like Greece  Yes it was like Greece  It was wonderful for a summer  And then I kind of  Hooked up with somebody  At a party at my house  Which is a bad thing to do  You can't really get away  And  You played her false  Anthony  She  Walked into the bedroom 
[02:14:30]  And found the girl  In the walk-in closet  She was hiding there  Yes  And you were under the covers  Yeah  Wow  She was hiding there  Behind all the girls  And you're  And you're blaming  Gene  No well that was before  When everything was okay  Gene  Kind of got her  In the newsroom  And was  You know  Making all kinds of remarks  And then came on our show  Right afterwards  And said  You know  If you don't watch out  I'll screw your girlfriend  And I kind of laughed  Because I didn't know  What had transpired  Before 
[02:15:00]  Until she called me up  And told me  Hey Gene Simmons  Was pulling some  You know  Stuff  Some moves  Trying to you know  He was being very inappropriate  I'm like  That son of a bitch  Came on here  Knowing that was my girlfriend  And gave me some crap  Without me knowing  So I just laughed it off  I wonder  What goes through  One's mind  Yeah  Doing that  On the air  Yeah yeah  He was  But it's risky  That's the kind of guy  That I see  Gene Simmons as being  He's a little vindictive  Well I don't know  But I don't know that  Maybe it's from the pain  Of growing up 
[02:15:30]  Right  I don't know  The guy I know  Touched my heart  Yeah he got a different gene  I got  I got  I got Gene Simmons  You know what Gene  I might have gotten  The one that beamed up  In the broken transporter  And divided into  Good and evil  Gene  See but that's  That's a very painful process  That I understand  It feels like your insides  Are being ripped apart  Being ripped apart  And then putting back together  Is a very difficult procedure  And thank God  Captain Kirk  It's not real  It's not real  It's not real  Together  There was a TV show  Because they couldn't survive 
[02:16:00]  Without each other  But the Gene Simmons interview  On Ron Irv  Bio Channel  On the Bio Channel  Tuesdays 10 o'clock  Oh thanks  I didn't know that  And is one of many  Touching interviews  Where you find the guy  And suddenly Gene Simmons  Is a real guy to me  How did you get there though?  How did I get there?  Yeah for real  How did you get there?  Because we just kind of  That's an interesting question  We just try shit  Out on our show  And sometimes we hit  And sometimes we don't  But you got to work immediately 
[02:16:30]  You got to get something now  There are people listening  Who will click you  Oh jeez  The Shatner's on  Let's turn it off  Unless Shatner's saying something  Of enough interest  Right  To stop the turning of that dial  Or else get Shatner off quickly  To get somebody more interesting  Never  But how do you get them comfortable  To say some stuff  That you've never said before?  I try to take up minutia  I try to take up  You know I would  I would talk  For example  If I were going to do 
[02:17:00]  You now  I would talk more about the girl  Right  How hurt you must have been  But what were you doing  Under the covers  Cheating  Right  Right  And why did you want to cheat  And what is cheating  And not make you feel guilty  But  I mean I  I wasn't caught under the  The blankets in my  In my day  Yes  But  We're all guilty of  Bad behavior  Of one kind  Or another  Over a lifetime  And there are reasons for that 
[02:17:30]  And  You were constantly leaving  Heartbroken women  All over the  Galaxy  Jesus  Bill  But what about you  And why did you do that  Thank you for bringing it back to me  Because you can't even look you in the eye anymore  That's right  And did it seem appropriate  Or were you doing it  To dirty the sheets  It was  It was pure lust  To tell you the truth  It was a very lustful thing  The relationship itself  I think during the summer  Had kind of run its course  And  Why  It was lust 
[02:18:00]  For your girlfriend as well  Yeah  For the girlfriend  And she wasn't mentally  Not so at the beginning  At the beginning  There was a relationship there  More so than just lust  But I think after the  The entire summer  The end of the summer  It kind of got to  Now hold on a second  Yeah  Hold on a second  Lust is good  I mean lust is really good  Yes  I mean it's part of what we are  Oh yeah  But are you  Do you know  In your lifetime  Of relationships  Do you know that lust  Mixed with affection  And love  Is better 
[02:18:30]  Oh absolutely  You do know that  Yeah  You've had that  It's got to be balanced out  Of course  Well not balanced necessarily  Absolutely  And for  Like when did you have that  Before the traffic girl  Right  Just before the traffic girl  Oh yeah  I think  Yeah  So why  What happened to that  Magical relationship  It went about nine  Nine years  Really  Yeah  And so  Did you leave her  Or did she leave you  Oh she kind of ditched me  And that hurt  That killed actually 
[02:19:00]  Yeah  Well you know something  I saw it coming  So it wasn't  Really that painful  Why didn't you do something about it  Because I'm kind of one of those guys  That I let things kind of  Take their course  No no wait a minute  What does that mean  You alter the course of this conversation  Why didn't you alter the course of the  Of what seemed inevitable  I should have  And I always kind of look back at those situations  And say I really should have done something about that  So you were inactive 
[02:19:30]  You were passive  Yeah very passive  And just kind of let things happen  And then I realized  But why  And see  Now you're into the interview  Yeah see  Now you're talking  No but keep going  Because we've been wanting to know the answer for this  For a long time  If we  If this were of interest to you  You're filming  You could edit  Right  And we would be  We'd be in the course of  The fact that  You did a nine year relationship  And since then  You've had a series of lustful  Interesting  But not fulfilling relationships  And in a way 
[02:20:00]  Your action in your own house  Was to stop  The relationship you were having  Very good yes  So that would be my guess  And we'd go on  We'd go on from there  And I don't know whether  He blew it up  Huh?  He blew it up  I blew it up  He blew it up  Exactly  He blew up that relationship  That's exactly right  That was the way to get out of it  Because I've been with Ann a long time  He doesn't like to confront things  No no  Not a big fan of confronting things  I think humans in general aren't  But Ann certainly isn't  So he goes for the  I'll just blow it up  It's easier not to 
[02:20:30]  And I'm guilty of that myself  I think we all are  Yeah I'm kind of a  Captain Christopher Pike  In the chair guy  Yes or no  You're good though  You're good  That was good too  So I would have gone further  And faster  I would have gone further  And faster on that  And we're there  Because we're talking about  Something that is  But you don't let him  Off the hook  And you like hit him fast  With the questions  Right  And because it is  A sensitive subject  And because he's vulnerable  On it  He was willing to open up  And he was a good guy  And knew what I was doing 
[02:21:00]  And allowed himself  But you're also not  A threatening guy  You're not like  Oh I'm going to  Dig this out of you  In some kind of a  Nasty way  Exactly  You're just talking  I'm just talking to you  I'm just finding  An interesting aspect  Of your personality  That you're sort of self  You're half aware of it  Or fully aware of it  Yourself  And haven't just  Talked about it  So you're not  Reluctant  To  To tell me  Yeah but it's Captain Kirk  That has something  To do with it too  William Shatner  William Shatner 
[02:21:30]  That's not Captain Kirk  Is actually giving you  Therapy  Actually  Which is your  I was imagining  I was being interrogated  By T.J. Hooker  So shut up  Let's not forget about  T.J. Hooker  Bob  What's wrong with you  Of course  The meatloaf interview  That was  He's a weird guy Bill  Because he  He is a guy  No he's not  For real  For real  Did you see the documentary  I think MSG did  No  And following him  Around the country  He's a weird dude 
[02:22:00]  He's sick every day  Sick physically  Yeah  I think he's terrified  To perform  So every day  Backstage  He's getting sick  And  And his whole  His own staff  Rolled their eyes  Like oh here he goes  Yeah but meatloaf  Touched your soul  Did he touch my soul  Yeah he did  Did you see the interview  No  Yeah I saw that  I saw the documentary  I'm just saying the documentary  Made me  On raw nerd  He makes you cry  For real  For real  What does he say  See 
[02:22:30]  There it is  What did he say  What did he say  Because yeah  Now I need to know  Death of his parents  At what age  Not so long ago  Really  Yeah  And he talks about it  He allowed himself  To talk about it  And suddenly  This  Young man  Who was  Unaccustomed  Maybe not unaccustomed  But ill at ease  At talking  Was not very verbal  Didn't know quite  What to do  And what to say  Was uncomfortable  For the first 
[02:23:00]  Five or ten minutes  Slowly opened up  And slowly  Began to reveal  An aspect of his life  That was meaningful  To him  And suddenly  We were into  A story of  Enormous proportions  Where both his parents  Who died  I think it was  Carbon monoxide  Together  Died  Wow  And he's performing  And he has to go on  Wow  Now is that a story  That's a hell of a story  Yeah  And  And  And he touched your soul 
[02:23:30]  And he's not weird at all  I mean  He may act weird  And he may be uncomfortable  But there  Inside  Meatloaf  Which  I asked him about his name  I mean  The very term  Meatloaf  Gives you  A disparaging  Thought about  Already  Not me  But  Meatloaf was his name  From the very beginning  It wasn't like  An assumed name  Wait  So he never  Well how long ago  Did that happen  I don't quite remember  But not too long ago  And he didn't tell anyone else  That before he went on your show  I don't remember reading 
[02:24:00]  Not that I know of  So what I'm saying to you is  These performers  That we  That we're able to book  Come on  And suddenly  They're talking about stuff  That is so part of their  A hidden part of their soul  That is so revealing  Their humanity  Is so revealing  That you want to love them  And you think it's the closeness  Physically  How close you guys are  I think that's an aspect to it  And there's no question  About the genuineness  Of my interest  I wish you were sitting 
[02:24:30]  18 inches away from Anthony  You would have had him crying  That's what it is  You would have had him crying  But the pizza last night  Would  It is true  It is the intimacy  The closeness  And yeah  You genuinely seem interested  In what they're talking about  If we were not on the air  If we were either  Somewhere else  On my show  Or having a drink together  In your house  Watching Monday Night Football  There you go  I would have followed  That conversation  Knocked on your door  I would have followed  That conversation  Until you wanted to stop 
[02:25:00]  Yeah  And we would have  Discovered more about  What lust is  And where it is  And how does it feel  Do you expose  A lot about yourself  During these conversations  I make a point  Of trying to do so  To make you feel comfortable  Yeah  A little more comfortable  So that  When I say  You know  I've done the same thing  Absolutely  Fouled my own nest  Yeah  Fouled my own nest  Wow  That's a good one  One way to put it 
[02:25:30]  What was your saddest moment?  Saddest?  Yeah  My own?  Yeah  Well  Many  But for me  The tragedy  Of  That  That is most memorable  In my life  Is the death of my wife  Yeah  Of course  Yeah  So  That is  A constant in my life  That was in 1999  I believe  Yes exactly  The pool accident  Exactly  And  And that  Has remained with me 
[02:26:00]  Every day of my life  Mm-hmm  So  I'm never  I'm never away  I  I find myself  Talking to her  Or  Saying something  Or  Yeah  Whatever  Yeah  There's a reality  There that  Is  It's one of those things  That you see in drama  People say  Well that's changed my life  That changed my life  Is that hard to be remarried though  But still have that love  For your old wife  To still you know  To talk to her  Well love  Love is  Elizabeth is my wife's name 
[02:26:30]  Love builds on itself  I think  You learn to love  And then you say  Oh that's  That's what I felt  I'd like to  Feel that again  Mm-hmm  But I didn't do so well  At that  I must try and remember  Not to do that again  Whatever it was  Some aspect  Right  And so  It builds upon itself  And you finally  You become  As you get older  If you do this  A better lover  In every sense of the word  Mm  Now of course 
[02:27:00]  Uh  Uh  Staying on  The sorrow thing  When Spock  Was in that chamber  In Rathacon  And uh  My heart went out there  He had died  And tears  I knew  That you were  Upset  About that  No no  More than upset  Yeah  Spiritually  Profoundly  And physically  When you leaned  Against the glass  And just kind of  Sat down  Yes  You were a broken man  At that point  I would have broken  The glass  Yeah I know  Don't go in there 
[02:27:30]  You'll flood  The whole compartment  Exactly  So I put my hand up  Yes  Which by the way  Strangely  You should bring that up  Uh  I  We were describing  Uh  Before the writing  Of the scene  Uh  Months before  The movie  Was being made  I  I said to the producer  And this is what  And you should  The glass should be clear  And then I'll put my hand up  And he said  Yeah yeah  I'll put the hand up  And he'll put his hand up  And we'll touch  With the glass  For him  And so the very thing  I had imagined  As an actor  That I would  To indicate 
[02:28:00]  The love between  Two men  Uh  The  Sulu was in that scene  Just kidding  Just kidding  I know  I know  But what I described  As  In the movie  That must be  An unusual aspect  Because so many changes  Take place  From the concept  To the execution  That was uh  One of the most  Emotional scenes  In any Star Trek  I believe  There were people 
[02:28:30]  Genuinely crying  In the theater  When I saw that  Like  Oh my god  Here is something  You never thought  You'd see  It's Spock  Dying  And Kirk  Having to watch him  Die like that  It was uh  It was some scene  Yeah yeah  I mean  I don't remember  Who thought of it  Must have been  One of the writers  But  You set that  You set that scene up  It's like  Imagining what would be  The ideal thing  Spock dies  And Kirk has to 
[02:29:00]  Watch  Now how do you  Affect that  That may have been  One way to do it  Work backwards  Right right  Here's a great situation  How do we get that to happen  Well he's gonna flood  The compartment  He can't open the glass door  But we can see him  Yeah yeah  That worked well  In the new movie  By the way  A great little homage  To uh  To your  Version of Captain Kirk  A couple of times  Which is just brilliant  Really  The way he sits in the chair  And crosses his leg  Uh  He walks in at the  At one point  And just looks and goes 
[02:29:30]  Boom  Uh  Eating an apple  During the Kobayashi Maroon  Uh  As you were eating it  Describing how you had  Gotten through it  In Rathacon  Just these little  They said you don't have  To be a Star Trek fan  At all  To enjoy the movie  Which is true  But if you are  You will see  Wow  Little things  And scenes  That are just  Like oh my god  That is right on the button  Wow  You know  Star Trek  So  Very cool  I hope  I really 
[02:30:00]  I  I don't know why  But I hope you enjoy it  Well  You know  I've got  Two other shows  On the air  Uh  This coming year  Um  Another show on bio  Called Aftermath  We're just starting to make that  Now  And a show on  Uh  Discovery  What is Aftermath  What is what  What is Aftermath  Aftermath  Is an idea that  Um  A concept that I  Was able to sell  Bio Channel  Um  And  Uh  We're

[02:37:30]  Spock is leaning  Against the tub  As he's back  Against the tub  And Kirk is just  Gently laying his head  On Spock's chest  And lovingly  Looking back at him  As they both bask  In the warm water  Of a bath  Spock's hand  Is real manly  Look at that arm  Draped over the tub  Oh I know  Holding his baby girl  Spock's just looking  At Kirk very logically  And Kirk is looking  Very lovingly  Who the fuck  Painted that?  Some sick son of a bitch  Made him homo

[02:45:00]  the case did someone die i got well no nobody died but see it should be somebody dies and then  you have to try to clear it and and fix what you did wrong no what happens is detective inc what  happens is is that uh those guys get away and i continue to chase them on the side but i have to  pay the bills so people come to me right so that's my side underlying storyline right and then you  every week you get new cases yeah that's the thing is that every case though like am and i go rogue so

[03:15:00]  worst experience of my life but let me tell you for one thing the part when you there's always a part  where i've gone to the urologist can i stop him for one second give him a little tip yes look at the  fucking audience not at the wall you're watching tv look at the crowd keep your eye on them he's  he's priceless all right all right well from where the surgery part where i said yeah the surgery part  yeah all right well let me tell you for one thing having to go through all those surgeries it is the 
[03:15:30]  worst thing i've ever had to deal with in my life to this day i'm scared of surgery for one thing  there's a part where i've had to go get an examination for the urologist and that's always  the worst part they tell you uh they're always like talking to my mother saying oh he has to  go through another surgery that part annoys me then there's a part where they take you up where they  take you up to the operate where they take you up to the operating room and it's like these big bright 
[03:16:00]  the blinding lights oh and the sound that's going right right this is like the sound it makes oh it's  so true and then they put you under this anesthesia let me tell you that anesthesia it is the best way to  get high without having about getting arrested i'm telling you it's one strange trip i don't know 
[03:16:30]  what it's like getting high but if it's anything like this for one thing they put you under some  anesthesia usually some mask or this thing they inject it to your iv usually i prefer the iv i don't  know why i hate i hate that mask yeah i don't know why that that that part always scares me so i always  tell them put the iv i don't want that mask just inject that thing that long needle into the iv  yeah that's all i tell them inject that long needle into the iv i'd rather it that way  and then well they they start talking to you a little bit and then you start like falling asleep 
[03:17:00]  and it's like this weird like sky thing like it's like when did i you in the ass  no you see you you hear you hear you hear the doctors like talking about i don't know like  they're like they're asking to get past the the knives or whatever the heck it is they use for the  surgery hold on hold on hold on that that might happen yeah you got to deal with that yeah you got  to deal with that yeah talk about hecklers bobby tell him listen listen hey bobo he's got to be ready  bobo look at my finger follow my finger right here look at me yeah someone's gonna you're definitely 
[03:17:30]  gonna get people yelling some shit out yeah they're gonna heckle you know what i mean so you're gonna  want to take the mic out of the stand and approach that person and say some shit to them yeah so you  know what a good one is i don't come to where you work and knock the dicks out of your mouth  right i just suck them on my own right i don't say that no no no no let's no let's let's play act so  go back a little bit yeah go back a little bit kenny's gonna interrupt and then let's see if you got  what it takes which part the part where i'm about to go under the knife yeah yeah yeah that's a good part 
[03:18:00]  all right well they will they inject that anesthesia and you start feeling like you hear  these people all talking why do they fuck you in the ass hey you you there yeah i'm talking to you i  don't go i don't go to your job and and suck all the dicks that you that you work with  i suck at myself that's it that's it that's perfect  exactly the way you should have it was perfect all right but you were prepared for that one so 
[03:18:30]  continue doing your material kenny's gonna come up with another heckle line and let's  see if you can handle it on your own because you're not gonna have bob kelly there giving  you advice so continue with your material ones for different situations depending what they say  yeah that was good the eye contact was good you held the mic they gave you power and then you  sucking at yourself perfect self-deprecating continue and kenny will hit you with another heckle line  and let's see how you handle it we're not gonna be there bob i left buffalo years ago i'm not going 
[03:19:00]  back go ahead well but what they what you go through is you start you they start hand they start passing  each other these knives or whatever it is they do for the surgery and then it's like i'm i'm still like  about to go to sleep on that anesthesia and it feels like they're like you're like flying past these  people and it's like really quick and it's like this heavy feeling and then next moment you wake up  it's like a few i don't know it's like some kind of warp or something or what it is but a few minutes
