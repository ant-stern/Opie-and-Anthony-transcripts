<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts' comedic introduction, establishing their "island" persona.  Jim Norton was in studio.  Initial discussion centered on a retracted nuclear bomb threat in New York City, transitioning into inflammatory commentary about the war in Afghanistan and various ethnic and religious groups, fueled by a caller's distrust of a specific ethnic group.  A caller recounted a near-accident involving a driver in traditional Arab clothing, further escalating the offensive tone.  The hosts then discussed Kevin Meaney's arrest for allegedly grabbing a National Guardsman's rifle, speculating on his mental state and sharing personal anecdotes.  Listener comments from an online message board, many highly offensive, were read.  A prank call segment featuring Tom from New Orleans involved calling a woman in a nearby parking lot, pretending Tom was searching for the "ugliest woman" for a contest; the woman's angry reaction was highlighted.  The show extensively previewed the "55-gallon drum challenge," detailing planned contents and anticipating outrage.  Rich Voss and Patrice were mentioned as upcoming guests.

The show then shifted to a critical discussion of Monica Lewinsky's HBO special.  The hosts and callers relentlessly mocked Lewinsky's appearance, using derogatory terms, and focused on the oral sex aspect of her relationship with President Clinton with crude language and sexual innuendo.  Audio clips from Lewinsky's appearance were played and mocked.  Audience reactions, particularly a man confronting Lewinsky, were discussed and derided.  Rich Voss and Patrice, while mentioned as being outside the studio, failed to deliver a promised sex tape. Numerous calls contributed to the mocking tone.  A spoof advertisement for a fictional workout video, "Lies of Steel," was aired.  The segment concluded with continued ridicule of Lewinsky.


The next segment began with Opie recounting a frustrating casino experience.  A caller, Lee, shared information about a purported Massachusetts law regarding sexual positions.  A discussion about a malfunctioning satellite affecting the broadcast followed.  The conversation then turned to R. Kelly and a related video, leading to the "Curdled Milk Girl" challenge featuring Tracy from South Philly.  Rich Voss and Patrice were in the studio.  The segment heavily focused on Tracy, her white husband Keith, and their relationship, with offensive jokes and comments about race, sex, and appearance.  Rich Voss's apartment was mocked using pictures from his website.  The show concluded with further discussions of race, offensive jokes, and the FU line featuring listener-submitted angry messages.


A later segment started with a discussion of a listener who repeatedly complained about the show, culminating in a violent and vulgar voicemail.  The hosts discussed listener complaints and their defiant attitude.  The "55-gallon drum challenge" was discussed, detailing the previous year's event (hissing cockroaches) and previewing a more extreme version.  Calls included updates on Kevin Meaney's arrest and prank calls to Miss Cleo.  A contentious exchange with comedian Jeff Norris involved insults, boasts about martial arts, and show promotions, interspersed with Frosted Mini-Wheats commercials.  The segment concluded with a "What Did We Learn?" segment featuring callers' humorous and vulgar takeaways.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show!  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Island.  Hello.  Hello.  I hope your trip to the island was an enjoyable one.  As the cruise ship pulls up and lets you off on the island,  enjoy the sights and sounds of the Opie and Anthony Tropical Paradigm.  The Opie and Anthony Island. 
[00:00:30]  Open for business.  Smiles, everyone. Smiles.  Where's Tattoo?  What's up, man?  A couple phone numbers in the New York area.  877-692-1027.  Anywhere else, including Philly, I guess.  866-2774. Wow.  Wow. That's 866-2774.  Wow. In the studio, Jim Norton, Anthony. 
[00:01:00]  Oh, yeah.  Myself.  Rich Voss coming by today with Patrice.  Always fun.  I'm just glad to be alive.  Yeah.  We could have all been dead.  Thanks for telling us, Rudy.  But I guess Rudy didn't even know.  Rudy said he didn't know.  These are all things that some higher-ups in the American government best thought we should know about. 
[00:01:30]  Seems there was some kind of a nuclear bomb alert in October.  Yeah, they kind of caught wind of some towel-headed animal that decided they were going to purchase a 10-kiloton nuclear device from the always upstanding and honorable Russians.  The former Soviet Union.  And then there was a little time there that they weren't really sure if they could find this bomb. 
[00:02:00]  Yeah, so apparently they thought that it had been brought into New York City and was sitting somewhere just waiting to be detonated.  And it was best, it was felt, eh, just best that no one knows about it.  Yeah, our fine government decide, you know, eh, they don't need to know.  Eh.  It'll panic people a little bit.  Well, of course it will.  Give me the chance to move to Montana if I want, please. 
[00:02:30]  Eh, they don't need to know.  We'll take care of this.  Yeah.  So it turns out in the long run they believe that it was false.  They believe.  They believe.  You know, I was reading that article today in the paper and I was just looking for a clue.  Uh-uh.  That says to me and my mind that, okay, this is taken care of.  But they used words like, we believe that this is a false alarm.  We believe that.  Our sources tell us.  Right.  And so you're like, all right, here's the bottom line. 
[00:03:00]  Somebody found out about this little memo or whatever that went around the higher up saying that there may be a nuke bound for New York.  And it was going to get out.  So they had to address it first.  So they come out and say, oh, it was in October and, yeah, nothing happened of it.  We knew that nothing.  But something tells me this ain't over yet.  And Norton is freaking out.  And the office is like, we're going to get nuked.  We're going to get nuked.  They're going to nuke New York. 
[00:03:30]  You know why we're going to get nuked?  Because they won't do the right thing.  Round them up and get them out.  Right.  Goodbye.  Thank you.  Goodbye.  But I didn't do it.  Goodbye.  Out.  If we figure this all out someday, perhaps you'll come back.  Out.  Right now.  Get out.  You know, if they detonate a nuclear device in Manhattan, I pray to God I'm one of the ones that goes.  Yeah.  Why not just be the one that goes? 
[00:04:00]  Really?  What a mess is going to be left.  It's going to be like 12 monkeys, Anthony, around here.  Like 12 monkeys.  I just saw that last night.  There's a lot of weeds growing everywhere.  Just weeds and animals running around.  That'd be great.  So we had to wake up to that news today.  They're saying things like, well, it would take out a half mile radius.  There would be nothing left in that half mile radius.  Right.  And then, what do they say?  Then pretty much everyone else in Manhattan would have some kind of radiation. 
[00:04:30]  That would just be leveled.  The half mile radius would be leveling.  But then, they're talking about, you know, the little far-reaching effects like radiation and then just the heat.  You know, there'd still be buildings maybe a little further out than a half mile radius.  But, no one's going to be alive in them.  They're going to be all effed up.  And then, you go further out and then there's the radiation.  And then, you just think about this.  New York, uninhabitable. 
[00:05:00]  You know?  It's kind of an important city for the economy and morale and whatnot.  But, you know, we had really better get on the ball and start doing things.  We slack off a little bit, maybe.  And, you know, what are nine guys they count now are dead?  Nine of our soldiers are dead now?  Yeah.  Over there in Afghanistan?  Well, the biggest problem I have with this story in the paper today, what else are they not telling us? 
[00:05:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  What else is kind of floating out there that they're trying to figure out?  Little things that we don't quite know about that they feel we shouldn't really know about yet.  We'll tell you if nothing happens.  What if you're sitting there, you're out on Long Island, you're over there in Jersey, maybe you're upstate,  and all of a sudden you feel this boom.  You see just a big flash of light.  You're like, boom.  What the hell was that? 
[00:06:00]  You look out, there's a flash of light, and then there's a big mushroom cloud rising over Manhattan.  I don't even think you get the word what out.  Yeah.  What?  What?  Vaporized.  Vaporized.  Vaporized.  And you know something, though?  You know what the odd, strange thing is?  What do you do?  What does the rest of the country do?  Hey, you're pretty upset for a while, but you know something?  You just go about your life.  Kind of like the Disney World philosophy? 
[00:06:30]  Hose it down.  Hose it down and move along.  Get that ride moving.  We are so much like those stupid ants on that anthill that every kid is kicked over at one point.  You kick it over, what happens?  Ah!  Ah!  Ants are running around like crazy.  And then you come back a little later, there's a straight line, and they're picking up their rocks and making their hole and dragging crickets back down.  Like, man, that was pretty cataclysmic earlier this morning when I kicked it over.  We're just like that, though. 
[00:07:00]  Doesn't matter how bad the problem is or the atrocity, we'll just kind of push that back and go along in our business.  Are you surprised how fast we went back to, quote, quote, normal living since 9-11?  Yeah.  It's still, believe me, it's still on everyone's mind and everything.  But, you know what?  I don't know.  People have moved on really fast with their lives.  The security has dropped.  They're already talking about the flyovers stopping because it's, ah, they don't deem it necessary, and the fuel is costing a lot. 
[00:07:30]  And the security that you see at the bridges and the tunnels, it's nothing anymore.  It's, you know, we're getting complacent again, and that's a perfect opportunity to pounce on us.  It might be years from now again.  Who knows?  What happened to all the flags on the cars?  They blew off.  They're pretty much either done or the ones you do see are so tattered from the wind and the rain and the snow.  And to answer your question, what will happen if something like a nuke went off in New York? 
[00:08:00]  I'll tell you what will happen.  And some people will go, out, get them out, get them out.  And other people go, oh, my God, you can't judge them.  That's all happened.  Well, I would just hope that it would cause a nice big revolution and people would just go insane and just take matters into their own hands and start kicking people out.  Because it's gotten insane.  Cheryl, what's going on?  Hi, guys.  Hey.  Let me tell you why I don't like these people.  Yeah. 
[00:08:30]  Okay.  With all the money that is being offered, right?  If it was a black person who was doing it, or a Puerto Rican, believe me, they would get information already.  But these people are not going to tell the government anything because they're so close-knit.  Right?  You don't want to say anything.  And with the amount of arms that is living here, one of them must know something, but they're not saying anything.  And they tell us that they love America? 
[00:09:00]  Look at your cards, Ms. Cleo.  Tell us who it is.  Now, but on a more serious note, guys, one of these people, they must know something.  Right?  That is why I don't like them and I don't trust them.  They, uh, they're, uh, they're not rats.  If I'm on the bus and I see one, come on, believe me, I'm getting off.  Well, you know something?  Here's another thing that's related to this whole, uh, story.  Because it all comes down to the terrorism and whatnot.  Um, nine Americans killed in Afghanistan over, uh, this weekend, today, and whatnot. 
[00:09:30]  Um, we have to answer that with, with hundreds, if not thousands, of them being killed.  That's how you answer it.  That's how you answer it.  Nine die, you gotta, like, wipe out a whole bunch more.  I say, uh, one American equals 100,000.  Yeah, that's good.  If you have to put a price tag on it, unfortunately.  So that means 900,000 of them have to die now.  Here's what's happening over there.  Pick a city.  Pick a good one.  Pick a good one.  Get a good one. 
[00:10:00]  And let's go.  Baghdad.  I like Baghdad.  These people, I don't trust them.  I don't trust them and I don't, I don't care what nobody say.  I don't like them.  Yep.  Here's what's happening over there in Afghanistan, uh, now.  These guys, these, uh, terrorists, uh, Al Qaeda, they're kind of regrouping.  And they know from previous mistakes and watching the Americans and how we fight our wars, it  gives them clues and shows them weak spots that we have.  And they used it to their advantage and took out a couple of helicopters. 
[00:10:30]  You know, now you gotta go in with even heavier stuff.  I still think a nuclear device in Afghanistan.  I think if there's a pocket of resistance, instead of sending people in, American, uh, uh, soldiers to be shot at hand-to-hand, they say they're muzzle-to-muzzle, uh, gunfire fights going on over there.  You know where they are.  You know what you do? 
[00:11:00]  Pfft!  Vaporize!  Vaporize them!  Go on!  You know something?  There'd be, there'd be no having to send people in.  No wondering if there's some pocket of resistance that went into a cave or anything.  Pfft!  Vaporized!  Yep.  Guys, take care, but we all have to...  Human, liquid, steam, vapor.  All in a matter of, of, uh, uh, an eye blink.  Turn a human being into, into steam. 
[00:11:30]  Yep.  That's what they need.  Yep.  I just think that with the amount of money that the government is offering, somebody should know something because they're so close-knitted and, I mean, we have to stick to each other and wipe them out.  All right.  Okay, bye.  These animals live in the dirt in caves.  They don't even know there's a reward.  Although somebody may be talking and collecting reward money and we're not hearing about it.  I'm sure they're not going to publicize that.  Yeah, I'm sure there's things going on that we don't know about.  Like, maybe there's a bomb in New York City. 
[00:12:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Hello?  Like, maybe, uh, we should have taken the month of October off and gone to Montana and skied.  Uh, Dima, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Listen, I don't know if this freaks out also, but, like, the other day, they casually mentioned  that they already have, like, a secret government planned on the ground.  Oh, the shadow government, yeah.  Just in case anything happens.  Oh, yeah, the underground bunker in Washington.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You know, they'll have, like, that thing where there's a movie where, like, each, like, species  gets planted there and there's going to be, like, a whole new civilization.  You know, just in case something happens up here. 
[00:12:30]  You know, hey, who needs anybody?  I, ah, we need Arnold.  I mean, it's messed up.  They're already talking about, oh, yeah, you know, there's already congressmen there.  We have a whole new government.  You know, hey, it's great.  Just in case anything happens up here, we have a whole new government down there.  Nothing to worry about.  I hope if it ever gets to the point where that government down in a bunker has to be  utilized, it is to make one decision.  Nuke the globe.  Nuke the friggin' globe. 
[00:13:00]  The entire thing.  Wipe it out.  Mother Nature start over with irradiated cockroaches.  Maybe they'll do a better goddamn job.  All right.  I'm disgusted with the goddamn Russians.  Because at every turn, these conniving scumbag Russians, you might listen to this show.  You might be a Russian driving a cab.  Your country sucks.  That's why you left.  So don't get pissed at me.  There is more corruption going on over there.  And they have nuclear weapons that are for sale. 
[00:13:30]  Just like, look, pick up the goddamn bylines or a newspaper and look for a Chevy.  How easy is it?  It's just as easy to get goddamn bombs over there.  Because they're corrupt.  They're a broken nation.  They lost a war.  It was a cold war.  No bombs flying everywhere.  But it was just as big a battle.  It broke the country's back.  And they are left in a position where they're very desperate.  These friggin' animals ragheads have money.  Put two and two together. 
[00:14:00]  You got the cash on one side that wants nuclear devices.  You got the broke people with the nuclear devices.  What?  Morality's going to rear its ugly head and stop that from happening?  Bull.  We're doomed.  Doomed as a nation.  We're too nice.  We should be nuking stuff.  Right now.  Hey, Mike.  What's going on?  Yeah, we're O&A.  Hey, bro.  Hey, dude.  Speaking of being doomed as a nation.  Yeah.  I had to set my cell phone to remember to tune back into you guys.  Listen, man. 
[00:14:30]  If I found out my only daughter just got AIDS from gay sex, it would have been funnier than  the show that was on before you guys.  Maybe you guys could possibly take out ads on other stations to remind people to tune  back into Opie and Anthony at three.  You know, we do our own thing now.  We do our own thing.  We're an island.  We don't pay attention to anything.  I don't even know what's going on.  We do our own thing now.  I'm brain dead.  That's how we do things now.  We do our own thing.  Back when men were dinosaurs.  Yeah.  Hi, hear me. 
[00:15:00]  Hi, hear me.  Listen, I'm in Philly, and I was a little skeptical when you guys came to town.  Yeah.  But you guys hooked me in.  I'm a devoted listener now.  I love the O&A show.  Mike, here's the deal.  Here is the deal.  You know from three till seven when the Opie and Anthony show were on?  Yes.  That's what O&A give a flying F about.  That's all.  There it is.  That's where we are concentrating all of our energies.  Which means it's a better show, because I'm not going to waste time giving my opinion 
[00:15:30]  on other things anymore.  That's all.  I'm a UPS driver, and you guys are on in my truck from three to seven every day.  All right, Mike.  Thank you.  I love O&A, and I got a big wow sticking right in the dashboard.  Thanks, man.  Thank you.  Love you.  You guys suck.  Norton, you roll.  Thank you.  Good luck, son.  Yeah, I mean, that's all we care about, three to seven.  That's our show.  That's what we do.  We gave it a good try, you know, trying to be part of a cohesive radio station, and it  didn't work out.  So we go back to doing what we know what to do. 
[00:16:00]  I don't know.  A radio show from three to seven.  Anything else?  Any other?  I don't know nothing.  I don't even know what station we're on in Philly anymore.  I have no clue.  I don't know.  I know we do a show from three to seven.  I also don't know who my friends are anymore, either.  Don't know.  Don't care.  I was having a lot more fun talking about nook in the world.  I almost felt like I had my finger on the button.  I was ready to hit it.  Boy, I'd be the worst president ever. 
[00:16:30]  I would be the worst president ever.  I totally learned by playing that goddamn game Tropico.  Remember that?  I was playing that a while back, and you're in charge of a small little country, and you  can make a democratic government or a communist or a rule with an iron fist dictatorship, and  every single scenario, the second the people started acting up or wanting something, I dragged  them into prison or killed them, and my popularity plummeted, and I couldn't afford the military  that it took to control the people, and then when my girlfriend played it, she put in schools 
[00:17:00]  and colleges and was nice to the people, and the empire went on for years.  I am the worst, because the first sign of problem, I want to bomb something.  That rocks.  All right.  Hey, Bleacher Anthony, what do you have today?  Guys, what's going on?  How could there be any dump left after that two to three hour?  I was listening.  The stuff I was hearing, Otto and George, when I was on hold, didn't swear as much as  the stuff I was hearing.  They were getting ripped on and killed on from everybody, and the funniest thing is,  every time somebody from Jersey or New York would call, they'd be like, you know, 
[00:17:30]  guys in Philly, we get this a lot when we first start out.  Hey, idiot, we've had you on for, what, a year and a half now?  You still suck.  We hate you.  We don't know.  You know something?  I couldn't even tell you who you're talking about.  The two fat guys before you.  Well, three to seven.  That's pretty much all I know.  You know, Bleacher Anthony, we're on a lot of stations all over America, so I don't know  who you're talking about.  There's plenty of people that are on before us, plenty of people after.  I don't know.  Well, guys, before you go, let me just say one.  We are an island.  Let me just say one thing.  They were threatening to give out the guy from Jersey's phone number.  Of course, they never did, but I wanted to call him and congratulate him, so that's 
[00:18:00]  all I had to say.  All right.  Later.  A lot of hostility in the air today.  I don't know why.  We're doing our show from three to seven.  Don't even know what's around us anymore.  Hey, where's Rick?  Rick, we've got to play the Tom thing from late Friday.  God damn, I was thinking about that all weekend.  As we take our first break.  I was laughing my ass off.  And then we've got to get into Kevin Meaney, our friend, getting arrested.  That's not right. 
[00:18:30]  It's going to be a huge story tonight.  It's breaking as we speak.  Rick, where does this call pick up from?  Picks up just when he walks out of the store, the convenience store.  Okay.  And, you know, he was on the line and getting yelled at, and then he goes outside to find  the person you want him to talk to, a Southern bail.  Right on.  Okay, everyone knows our new pal in New Orleans.  Tom in New Orleans.  Tom, who runs the station down in New Orleans.  I run the station when it's on there. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah.  He called us Friday on his way home from work, and he had to pick up some cold ones.  No surprise there.  That's pretty normal, though.  Friday, most people stop by the Packy or the, you know, the convenience store or whatever  to get some cold ones.  And we decided to have some fun with him.  So we want to talk to some of the people that were around him.  In the store, he's talking to the cashier and all that.  We want to get much out of him.  And then he was outside this convenience store in the middle of a bad section of New Orleans.  And that's when we proceeded to have a little fun with our buddy Tom from New Orleans. 
[00:19:30]  Listen to this.  A nice Southern bail on the air.  Oh.  I don't know how nice to hear.  I do declare your poop chute is the most pretty.  We're, um, we're kind of in a, um.  Instead of getting a, you know, Southern bail.  In a bad neighborhood.  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah.  I do declare your Tom is some kind of a man.  Man, you're going to get.  You're going to get.  You're going to get.  You're not getting the Southern bail here, boys.  Believe me.  She might be getting Queen Latifah's angry young sister, but she's coming out. 
[00:20:00]  As soon as she's done military pressing, have her come to the phone.  Wait, he's waiting for the lady.  A fake jacket on with some baggy jeans.  Yeah.  He's waiting outside.  And, uh, hold on.  I'm waiting outside.  All right.  All right.  Hey, how you doing, man?  How you doing?  This is, uh, Opie and Anthony from New York to do a radio show.  Uh-huh.  I just wanted to talk to you on the air.  They're syndicated in, like, 50 markets.  Oh, okay.  Big numbers.  Hold on.  Okay.  Opie and Anthony.  Hello.  How you doing, baby?  Okay.  How you doing?  What's your name?  My name is Kathy.  Kathy?  Yes, sir? 
[00:20:30]  Kathy, Tom was supposed to pick the ugliest woman in that parking lot.  Are you the ugliest woman in that parking lot?  Oh, that's what his brother did?  Yes.  Oh, Tom.  Oh, why would you do that to me?  He did some.  He's supposed to pick the ugliest woman in the parking lot.  No, they didn't.  Oh, why would you do that?  Oh, man.  No, I'm not the ugliest woman.  He's gone.  She threw the phone down or something.  Oh, my God. 
[00:21:00]  Effing brilliant.  That's great.  No, no.  Give that Emmy to Norton right now.  Yeah, there you go.  That's great.  Holy Jesus Christ.  We're all, Barney, this goddamn thing.  We're all trying to flip it.  You nailed it.  You nailed it.  Holy.  That was too goddamn funny.  I need to hear that again.  Immediately.  Immediately.  We're running out of time on the show.  Oh, you don't do that.  Oh, Tom.  Tom.  They told me you were supposed to be the ugliest woman. 
[00:21:30]  Oh, my God.  Oh, God.  Tom.  Hey.  Hey, what happened, man?  I think you might...  You threw the phone at me.  Turn the radio down, Tom.  It's down.  Oh, okay.  I'm no rookie.  Goddamn.  That was funny.  What'd she do to you?  She said, you're tired of this woman in the parking lot, Tom.  And then she said something else to you. 
[00:22:00]  And then the other girl that was in line, the other lady, I should say, was bitching about me hitting her funions.  She hollered at her.  She was hollering at her.  Come on.  Leave me alone.  And then she threw the phone at me and left.  Tom.  You hung me out to dry there.  You know, you hung me out to dry there.  I need a drink.  God, he never disappoints.  We're going to have to wait through the phone at me.  Ah, there you have it from Friday.  He got nailed. 
[00:22:30]  That's so funny.  I guess she was big and ugly, too, man.  Threw the phone at me.  You can hear him in the background going, oh, no, they did it.  Oh, no.  Don't throw the phone.  All right, we've got to take a break, but Bruno wants in real fast.  Bruno, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, man.  I got a little bit of one today.  All right.  It's only 320.  What?  Tim Sabian.  He's traded in his white, the black tight slacks.  Yeah.  He traded in for a skirt.  Tim, Tim.  You know any Tims?  Nope. 
[00:23:00]  Tim.  Never heard of the guy.  Guys, you rock.  Take it easy.  I'm looking around the O&A Island.  I don't see any Tims.  No.  You know what Tim on the O&A Island, though?  Oh, but you'd know him because the island is so small that we know everybody on it.  Tim, Tim.  Yeah.  You know any Tims, Jim?  No?  And we're closed to immigration.  Is this a brand of humor you can appreciate?  All right, let me get a little saucy here.  Oh, for the love of Eve, you bet.  Life serves you up lemons, you make lemonade.  We're a little out of control here.  Stop cracking wise.  Oh, my stars. 
[00:23:30]  Go f*** yourself.  Tasteless, offensive.  A lot of ass grabbing.  Horrific and tasteless.  People going deaf.  Just makes me want to stick a knife in someone.  Stuff you get here on this show.  Aren't we supposed to be trained to gain listeners, guys?  No!  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  Is that a surprise to you?  Yeah.  M.E.W.  You're checking out the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Ah! 
[00:24:00]  The phones are lit today, Andy.  Let's go to Mike.  Mike, what's going on, man?  Hey.  Hey, Mike.  Driving this day, coming back from Turtle Back Zoo with my family.  In that two-lane road.  Yeah.  All of a sudden, the car on the right starts totally leaning into my side, pushing me completely over.  And I'm yanking the horn, and the girl doesn't see anything.  Pull up next to them.  They got on that full, traditional garb where there's nothing but little tiny slits in the eyes for them to see out of it. 
[00:24:30]  Uh-oh.  Hey, on another note, guys.  I wanted to drop this one on you.  I won't mention their names, but there's two other DJs I'm forced to listen to in the afternoon.  Gave them a call.  Thought I was leaving a message with an intern.  Turned out to be the actual DJ.  Said to me, I said to him,  Listen, maybe you could have him comment a little bit more on his family life,  because that's all he seems to do every day of the week.  Turns out it was the actual tool.  Told me to go F. 
[00:25:00]  And I hung up after I heard that kind of language.  The guy actually called or ID'd me.  Called my place of appointment.  Spoke to my receptionist.  And had the nerve to get me back on the phone and curse me all out again.  What?  You heard it.  That's a bit of paranoia.  Well, there you go.  All right.  Something amazing.  Thank you, Mike.  You guys are awesome.  I can't quite see that far over the horizon from our beautiful island that is the Opian Anthony show.  So I don't know. 
[00:25:30]  I don't know nothing.  I didn't see nothing.  Was that a barge going by or something?  Yeah, you, Jordan.  But Mike tricked us, Anthony.  He tricked us a little bit, because it was on the screen.  He almost crashed into an Arab lady, because she only had a slit to see through.  But you see, then he flipped it, and then started talking about what he wanted to talk about.  Oh, we better not talk about the Arab people.  We'll have to run a bunch of PSAs.  Watch out.  The only time I want to hit star 69 is if I'm on the phone with a girl who calls me, and she's like, I really want to suck. 
[00:26:00]  And the phone goes dead.  Then you star 69.  For any other reasons, it's a waste of money, and it's stupid.  Jeff, what's going on?  Hey, not much.  How are you guys?  Pretty good today.  I'm going to open up my paper out here in San Jose and read about Kevin Meany.  Yeah, we just had him on the show, what, a week ago?  A week ago.  Yeah, I was hanging out with him at the Carolines after the show.  I got to tell you, I was reading an email before the show today.  A lot of email coming in today for some reason.  And all of a sudden, someone sent me the Kevin Meany thing. 
[00:26:30]  And I just, I threw it in the trash, and I deleted it.  I'm like, someone is just pulling my leg.  And then another email came in about it, and another.  And then it's, what, it's on the Drudge Report?  Yeah.  And it's a true story.  You've got to, Ann, you're going to read the story, right?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, Jeff, we're going to talk about it right now.  All right, thanks, Diamond Dust.  All right, Jeff.  10-4.  Oh, I better start.  I'm 69, 10-8.  I didn't like that comment.  Go ahead, Ann.  Hopi, it seems, yeah, Kevin Meany. 
[00:27:00]  I don't know what the hell this is all about.  A stand-up comedian was arrested after he allegedly got into a loud argument and scuffle  with a National Guardsman at San Francisco International Airport.  Kevin Meany, 45, allegedly grabbed.  The soldiers loaded M-16 rifle with both hands and got into a shoving match with him Sunday  after airport authorities repeatedly asked the comedian to stop videotaping checkpoint security  procedures.  He was stupid enough to grab an M-16 with both hands.  Yeah.  At an airport. 
[00:27:30]  Now, everyone who's flown recently knows you see these guys.  They're right by the security.  They have loaded weapons.  They are standing there.  That takes balls.  Because they're pretty damn intimidating.  Dude, that's not counting carrying the M-16.  I don't even eyeball them.  You walk right past.  He grabbed?  He grabbed the M-16 with both hands and started, like, pushing, I guess.  Pushing.  He's like a crazy person.  He's like a crazy person.  You're going to put an eye out with that M-16. 
[00:28:00]  It's an M-16.  We could lose the house.  What if that would have fired and shot someone?  We could lose the house.  You're like some kind of a crazy person with your M-16s and your tight pants.  We're a baggy pants family.  Making jack sauce, grabbing M-16s.  The guy grabbed the soldier's M-16.  When they arrested him, did he sing We Are the World to all the cops? 
[00:28:30]  We are the world.  We are the children.  We are the ones.  So what happened to him?  Well.  Did they wrestle him down to the ground and stuff?  First of all, I can't understand videotaping in the airport.  That's a little odd, especially in this day and age.  You kind of know people aren't going to be too hip to you videotaping the security procedures.  Danny was asked to stop, and there was a problem there. 
[00:29:00]  But then security officers asked to pat down Meany's wife.  She told him she had nothing to hide and exposed her bra.  Meany's wife a little wild, I guess.  She wasn't arrested.  Meany was being held Sunday at San Mateo County Jail.  He lives in L.A., blah, blah, blah.  A woman answered the phone at his house and said he was unavailable for comment.  And we're trying to get him.  But we got through to his agent, and the agent's going to give Kevin the message. 
[00:29:30]  Yeah.  If Kevin feels like talking about this, he will definitely call us today.  Boy.  He seems a little on edge, though.  Something's going on in that mind of his.  Well, you know something?  Kevin, Kevin Meany's the type of comic, at least on stage, you would never think he would be like this.  And why was he grabbing the M-16 with both hands?  I know.  Like some type of big, delicious mule that you're just shaking your face and saying, thank you God for.  Did he have the little, uh, the suit on with his bow tie and sweating? 
[00:30:00]  That's not right.  That's not right, grabbing the rifle.  What are you, a crazy person?  You don't grab rifles at the airport, taping, videotaping things.  You're like a crazy person.  If you had to list things to do in an airport, that would absolutely be the last thing.  Yeah.  To grab the rifle of a National Guard person.  Well, you know something?  So, the first inkling I got that Kevin Meany wasn't quite like his stage persona was last week. 
[00:30:30]  I went to go see him down at Caroline's here in New York City.  And, um, after the show, he's hanging out.  We've got a table, having some beers.  He starts, you know, drinking a little bit.  We're all drinking.  Here's his big bit.  He's been doing this bit since 85.  Yeah.  Maybe 86.  I remember seeing this bit in, uh, Rochester in 88.  Yeah.  Go ahead.  I'm sorry.  So, he, uh, so he plays all the parts of the We Are the World song. 
[00:31:00]  Yeah.  He, like, lip-syncs them all and looks just exactly like the artist's doing it.  But only it's, uh, Kevin Meany.  Look, I'll do it.  There comes the time.  Hey, you.  It doesn't work for radio.  When we heat a circle.  That's a good impression, Ant.  Look at you.  Yeah, see?  I'm doing it.  If this was TV, you'd see I was done.  Together as one.  And then, like, he'll, Willie Nelson part will come in and put the bandana on real quick.  There's a chance we're making.  You know.  In all fairness, because I'm, uh, messing a little bit, uh, I heard he, uh, had a good  set of Carolina.  Yes. 
[00:31:30]  We're just having fun with him.  But, so, you were talking to him after the show?  Yeah.  So, he's telling me, uh, he, he puts on his jacket to leave and he's got a, uh, lift ticket  on.  It's from, uh, Utah.  Like, oh, would you go to the Olympics?  He goes, yeah.  Went to the Olympics.  How was it?  I don't know.  He goes, left early.  He left the Olympics early.  He goes, yeah, had a problem.  I'm like, uh-oh.  What's this all about?  So, he has this condo that he rented out in, uh, Salt Lake City for the Olympics.  Looks like he's had two major problems in the last two, three weeks.  I know.  That's what I'm thinking. 
[00:32:00]  So, this is before police were involved.  Grabbing the M-16 with two hands in the air.  Right.  Ah.  All right.  Go ahead.  So, uh, his wife and, uh, daughter went ahead and got this condo and he was meeting them  later because he had some prior engagements.  So, he, uh, finally gets there a couple of days later and his wife starts relaying these  stories about how the guy that owns the condo and rented it is a prick and he's been saying  these, uh, things to his, his wife.  He's like, uh, so, so, I'm, I'm like, Kevin, what, what was he saying to your wife? 
[00:32:30]  He goes, just inappropriate, very inappropriate things.  And I'm like, well, like what?  Things you just don't say to another man's wife.  Like, uh-oh.  What the hell is it?  Now, I'm looking and I'm like, this isn't the Kevin Meaney on stage.  This isn't jack sauce making jack sauce.  What is the jack sauce?  So, he says, uh, he, uh, was tired of the guy waking up and, and, uh, uh, Kevin would  wake up and go outside and the guy would be, hey, Kevin, how you doing? 
[00:33:00]  Knowing that he said this stuff to his wife.  So, finally one day he goes, just, why don't you just F off?  He goes, I don't like the way you're treating my wife.  I don't like things you've said to her.  And, uh, I want my money back and I'm getting out of here.  I'm starting to think he's got a hot wife.  I know.  I know.  The wife causing problems.  That's a sure sign of a hot wife if she causes problems.  Hey, lady, show your T's in the airport.  You're flat.  You're probably said.  She was saying, uh, he must have been saying something.  I don't know.  Kevin, uh, wouldn't elaborate.  So, he got the hell out of Salt Lake? 
[00:33:30]  No.  He goes, I want my money.  The landlord goes, no.  I'm not giving you your money.  So, Kevin goes, all right, I guess I'll just take it out of the security.  Deposit.  And they had these huge, huge picture window with those vertical blinds.  You know, the ones that go from the ceiling to the floor.  Big ones.  He goes, I'll just take it.  Boink, right.  Boink, out.  Boink, of.  Boink, the.  Boink, security.  Boink, deposit.  Boink.  As he's pulling down one at a time.  Ripping them out of the blind mechanism.  Oh.  So, uh, next thing you know. 
[00:34:00]  Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.  Cops show up.  The landlord called the cops.  The police are involved.  We're going to lose the house.  And, uh, both sides of the story were told.  And, um, Kevin, uh, said he was, uh, asked to leave.  And he said, fine.  And the guy wasn't giving him his money back right away.  They only had one key.  This was like Kevin's big thing.  He goes, they only had one key.  So I took it and said I didn't have it.  And then when I drove down the road, I threw it into a big snowbank. 
[00:34:30]  So I'm like, wow, that seems a little unlike the Kevin Meaney persona.  And then now this?  Woo!  Threw the key in the snowbank and you said the mob hit back hard.  Might have been funny if I had said it without tripping.  Ah, you stink.  And they, uh, so they have released him from the airport incident?  Uh, last I heard is, uh, this.  It just says Sunday held at San Mateo.  They got out?  Yeah, he, he, I, uh, according to his agent, I guess he's home.  Oh, he is. 
[00:35:00]  But.  Don't we all not taking calls?  I don't have his home name.  Ah, see, if I know in hindsight.  Can we get a hold of him on his little website there?  What does the Meaney can look like?  Right.  Chris, what's going on?  What's up, man?  Hey.  What's going on?  Not much.  I ran, uh, ran to the guy about a month and a half ago.  Uh, Kevin Meaney?  Yeah, he's an absolute nutcase, dude.  He looks a little, uh, a little different.  Yeah, he told me to eatabullet.com.  Whoa!  That's what you, Norton, you're the man.  Thank you, sir.  Guys rule.  Good job, bro.  Godspeed, son.  Let's go to Brian in Philly. 
[00:35:30]  Brian, what's up?  What's up, guys?  I don't know how I got to your show today, man.  I couldn't get through other stuff.  I'm going to slit my wrists.  I don't want to mention any names, but those guys are so terrible.  You can't stand them.  Right?  There you go.  What do you got, Brian, for our show?  I just, I was calling to tell you guys that, you know, I don't want you to be mad at Philly  and all because of what YSP did to you is because Philly still loves you guys, you know  what I mean?  Oh, I'm not pissed at you, Brian.  Yeah, definitely.  Don't be mad at Philly.  I'm going to go egg their house or something.  All I know is that I'm responsible, uh, trying to entertain you guys from three to seven. 
[00:36:00]  Yeah, you guys got the best show around, man.  And that's all I care about now.  Good deal.  That is it.  Good deal.  I made a major mistake in my career, uh, thinking I should care about other things.  Yeah.  I was stupid.  Stupid.  Way to do it, man.  Don't be stupid.  So I got more time to work on the Opie and Anthony show from three to seven.  Kevin looks, Kevin Meany looks very relaxed, drinking a cup of coffee on his Meany cam that  is dated February 26th.  Why isn't it live? 
[00:36:30]  He never updates his, uh, Meany cam.  Let's look at, are you a crazy person?  Is there a, um, one of those, uh, things where you can get on, what do they call that?  Is that a guest book?  No guest book on this?  I'd love to read some of those now.  Mike, what's going on?  Hey, boys, what's going on?  Hey, bro.  You think Private Meany had a war cry when he grabbed the rifle?  Ah!  Later, dude. 
[00:37:00]  You didn't convince me.  What the hell is Kevin Meany doing with that loaded weapon?  Kevin, why aren't you stomping Kevin Meany's guts out?  You need to get Kevin Meany on the show.  I'm very distracted now.  There's more to this story, obviously.  Yeah.  I bet he grabbed it with, what's that, some kind of sick joke?  By the way, Dan from Hoboken on the Instant Feedback app.  The city freaked out when a bus full of naked teens went down Broadway.  Imagine if there was a bus full of plutonium. 
[00:37:30]  No ass.  Yeah.  The Are You a Crazy Person is the guest book.  Oh.  Well, there we go.  Let's check that out.  Nothing like...  No, it's not a...  Nothing new about the airport incident.  Oh, well.  I sure hope he could get them because that would...  That would be an exclusive for us, Opie.  We never get exclusives.  We have a chance.  We have a chance at this exclusive. 
[00:38:00]  Caroline, Brian, what's up?  Hey, I was just a little bit concerned with, lately, all the comedians who work so clean,  like Paula Poundstone and Kevin Meany getting into trouble.  Yep.  Somebody better keep an eye out on Brian Regan because I'm really worried about him.  Brian.  Oh, here it is.  Now I'm seeing some of the people that are responding.  Even the dumbass that tried to set off a sneaker bomb was smart enough to get on the plane.  Where does that put you on the intelligence scale? 
[00:38:30]  This is all to Kevin Meany.  Go to hell, you commie bitch.  You're lucky I wasn't a guardsman.  I would have cracked your dumb skull with the butt of my rifle.  S for brains.  You are an effing moron.  The National Guard should have cut your head off.  Dumbass people like you should be shot wasting my tax dollars, wasting security time, and  potentially letting people on the plane unsearched because you had to create an incident.  I think all you famous a-holes should be shipped over to the war and forced to fight for the 
[00:39:00]  millions you rake in.  They need to train these National Guard troops better because if you try to take my rifle,  you'd have two in the chest and one in the head before you realize how very dead you were.  Wow.  Including a headshot.  He was a Marine.  In the book, Suppository Building, sir.  Wow.  So, the accolades rolling in.  I can't believe you are so stupid.  I hope you enjoy your fame and your new cellmate.  As for your wife, I suspect she'll continue the family practice of yanking on men's guns. 
[00:39:30]  Don't you have enough money to keep your sorry ass out of prison?  How long before this gets shot down like Alec Baldwin's message board?  Oh, shut down.  Go F yourself, A-hole.  That's a popular one.  What the hell were you thinking, Cone Ruff?  Imagine Kevin in prison like Oz, though.  How long before, like, the Aryan Nation or the black guys are just picking up a big fist 
[00:40:00]  full of axle grease and laying them over the pool table.  You're poking me.  Ow.  That's not right.  This is called anal rape.  Why are you anal raping me?  Put a little lipstick on him.  He'll look like Rodney's wife and natural-born killers.  Oh, remember that?  Oh, and...  All right.  Let's go to Brad.  Brad, you're next on the O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[00:40:30]  What's happening, man?  Hey, Brad.  Hey, I saw that movie We Were Soldiers last night.  Ah, so did I.  You did?  Yes, I did.  What'd you think, Brad?  What's up?  What'd you think of the movie?  Oh, it was damn good.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I don't know.  There's some crazy parts.  Remember that part where the dude's flying up on the helicopter?  Crazy part, man.  Yeah.  I don't think I enjoyed the movie as much as you, Brad.  How?  I'll give it an honest assessment.  I didn't think it sucked. 
[00:41:00]  I thought it was okay.  It was pretty good.  If you're into the war footage, it's great.  A lot of killing.  A lot of battle scenes.  I mean, the whole movie pretty much is battle.  Yeah.  How about that part where a dude's getting flown up.  He gets fast and his face is burned off.  That was awesome.  Yeah.  Frosty beverage, Brad?  Yeah, really.  That's pretty intense, man.  All right, Brad.  We'll discuss.  Thank you for the topic.  Bye, buddy.  All right.  Buckle down.  We can discuss the movie after the break, right?  Oh, look at that little tease. 
[00:41:30]  Wow.  It's not a great tease, but it's a tease just the same, right?  And you'll get my review after this.  Right.  Ugh.  Fuck your drivel.  Ugh.  Hey, anything else on the message board there?  The Kevin Meaney message board?  That's about it for now?  Yeah.  Well, no.  What's wrong with you?  Where's Rick?  Get out of the country?  Well, that's a little harsh.  Where's Rick?  I got to ask him about some.  I want to know if Curdled Milk Girl is showing up today.  Remember, we gave her a second chance Friday, Ant? 
[00:42:00]  I bet we get F.  You think we're going to?  Uh-huh.  Is Curdled Milk Girl coming today?  Wow.  I totally forgot about her.  Uh-oh.  Oh.  I'll call her right now.  Uh-oh.  Oh.  It's going to be hell to pay.  All right.  Well, why don't we take a break?  Oh, boy.  What?  It's going to be hell to pay during the break now.  Yeah, I forgot.  That was going to be the big showstopper today.  The milk has been curdling all weekend.  It is so disgusting. 
[00:42:30]  It's leaking through the cup.  It's leaking through the cup, Anthony.  And what's leaking out is not milk-colored.  Could you get, uh, go get it real fast.  No, no, no, no.  Just get it real fast.  If it accidentally falls or even one drop gets anywhere,  it's going to really, really stink.  Here's one.  Rick's getting the milk.  Kevin, try not to be so dumb.  Comedy is fun, but there is actually a real world out there  where people die for doing stupid things.  Yeah, you think maybe he was just kind of doing it as a joke?  I'm being goofy. 
[00:43:00]  I'm being wacky.  I'm starting to think he did it as a joke  because they let him out of jail already.  Give me your gun.  No way.  Give me that gun.  You're going to put an eye out with that thing.  Look, I'm Kevin Meany.  Ow, don't hit me with the butt of that.  I bet they were filming,  and he was stupid enough to, you know, go,  hey, let me see what will happen if I do this.  You're pointing a gun at a famous person.  No one is that stupid.  They're on high alert around the airports.  Everyone is on edge,  and you're going to grab an M16 with two hands? 
[00:43:30]  I bet he was hopped up on the pot.  Oh, my God.  I bet he was hopped up on the pot.  What is that?  No, don't.  It is as thick as a fribble.  Dude, see one drip coming out of the bottom?  Why didn't you put a coffee cup under it?  Because I swear to you,  if something leaks out of there,  the studio is going to stink.  I just want to see what milk looks like.  Let's keep it out all weekend long.  This is solid now.  It's solid?  It's just turning to curds and whey. 
[00:44:00]  No!  No!  No!  No!  Just real fast.  No!  God damn it!  It's going to stink the whole place up  so bad you're not even going to be able to deal with it.  Open it up.  God damn it.  Come on.  Don't be a wuss.  It's not a wuss.  I can't put it out.  Just open it up.  Here, pop the...  Oh, my God!  She can't eat that.  Let's see.  That's just milk.  Dude, it's a solid mass.  All right, put the cover back on.  Put the cover back on.  That's fine.  What the hell did you guys put in there 
[00:44:30]  to make it a solid mass like that?  We just dropped some...  What was it?  Lime?  It is a solid mass.  It's just...  It's turned.  It's turned into something else.  How do you make it get like that?  It does that, milk.  It just turns into that.  Lemon or lime juice was added?  Yeah, but if you leave milk like that,  it'll just end up like that anyway.  It's solidified.  If she shows up,  and I have to go on record right now  and say I guarantee she blows us off,  she's going to have to scoop the milk 
[00:45:00]  out of the container.  What, Stinky?  All right.  She's not at home,  and she didn't come into work, so...  She may be on her way.  That's a good sign.  That could be, guys.  That's a good sign.  Here's a guy claiming  that he saw the Kevin Meany incident.  Dan, what's up?  I think...  Oh, hey, what's happening, brother?  I smell set up.  Go ahead, Dan.  Yeah, I was at the airport  at the time of the Kevin Meany incident.  Wait, what state?  What state?  What's that?  What state was it in?  California.  Okay.  And the whole time, 
[00:45:30]  and he goes over,  grabs that guy's rifle,  and the damn guard,  he starts shooting,  eatabullet.com,  eatabullet.com,  eatabullet.com.  Norton, you rule, brother.  Look at the guy helping Norton out.  Yeah, but we knew that was a setup.  God, will town hall sell out  so we don't have to push it anymore?  I am not pushing.  I thank you for calling in, son.  I appreciate it,  and be good.  Jim Norton, town hall,  April 18th.  Tickets on sale now  through Ticketmaster.  It is actually selling very well  thanks to the Opie and Anthony program.  All right.  Oh.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:46:00]  Make it touch her.  Coming soon,  the return of the 55-gallon drum challenge  on the Opie and Anthony Show.  And EW.  Hey, we're back  with the Opie and Anthony Show.  You're a crazy person.  Kate's from Wisconsin, Anthony.  Kate, what's going on today?  You guys want to feed her  that curdled milk?  Yeah.  You guys ought to know  that she's going to get  really, really ill.  Why?  Because you guys have let 
[00:46:30]  bacteria build up in there  to the point where  it's made cheese.  Ah, so it's good.  No, because you didn't use  the right kind of bacteria.  You know,  if you want her to,  you know,  drink some and throw up,  you can let it curdle  for a few hours.  That's cool.  That's good radio.  We can listen to her throw up.  This is going to make her  very, very ill,  like lawsuit type ill.  Oh, like food poisoning,  maybe die ill?  Yeah, it can do that.  It depends on how bad it is.  It's got that kind of  bacteria, right?  Yeah, and if you want  to feed it to her,  you can go ahead. 
[00:47:00]  I just wanted you guys  to be aware.  Opie, I think she's  absolutely right.  Well, we better get  new milk.  It might be good.  Kate, it is,  I want to say  it's hard as a rock,  but it's not that hard.  Is it jiggly?  Don't watch it wiggle.  It's kind of jiggly.  Yeah, it's cheese.  Not much, though.  It's pretty solid.  It's a solid mass.  It's not good cheese,  but it's cheese.  Cheese.  It's like from under.  Yeah, we...  From under cheese  with all its fine bacteria.  Yeah, the kind  you can spread  on your toast. 
[00:47:30]  Kate, you live  in New York City  with that accent?  Yes, they do.  Oh, wow.  It's amazing.  People always go,  you're not from  around here, are you?  You're from Wisconsin.  Yes, I am.  Yeah.  Farm country.  Farm country.  We'll take it  under advisement.  Good luck, guys.  Rick is going to try  to cut the curdled milk.  I bet she don't like  them queers neater.  Neater.  I worked for a bunch  of them, actually.  You worked for the queers?  Yeah, nobody knew that  except me.  They don't like the queers  in Wisconsin. 
[00:48:00]  They're very insular.  They've not been exposed  to it a whole lot.  All right.  Yeah, right.  Whoa.  Hey, dude.  Put that back in there.  It doesn't really  smell anymore.  We went too far  with the curdled milk thing.  It doesn't smell anymore.  It turned into like  cottage cheese.  It's like hard cottage cheese.  It looks like cottage cheese.  Yeah.  You want curdled milk,  you give it a couple  hours to overnight.  You want cheese,  you give it all weekend.  Well, someone from  Wisconsin would know.  They're cheeseheads. 
[00:48:30]  All right, Kate.  We've got to get  new milk just in case  this lady shows up.  She will be the last  qualifier for the  55-gallon drum challenge,  by the way.  And we're doing  the 55-gallon drum challenge  Friday.  Oh, thanks, Rick.  Are we set for Friday, Rick?  We're set, right?  Oh, yeah.  So we're going to have,  I don't know,  I think like eight girls.  Eight girls, nine  if this girl comes in today.  And basically,  we put them in  55-gallon drums, Anthony.  Ugh.  And we proceed to  dump all sorts of stuff  into the barrels  for three, 
[00:49:00]  three and a half hours straight.  That's crazy.  We don't really...  I'm going to grab a rifle.  We don't want to really  announce some of the things  we're going to be  throwing into the barrels  because we don't want  the ladies to prepare.  No, no, no.  We can tell you  this much...  Unprepared.  It's going to be insane.  It's going to be sick.  They're not going to enjoy it.  Just imagine some of the things  we could throw into  a dark 55-gallon drum.  That would scare  the cheese of the devil.  Crumpled up crackers.  Ah, ho, ho.  Eat a mouthful  and try to whistle.  Yeah. 
[00:49:30]  Dump a thing of flour  on their head.  That'll be outrageous.  Maybe some...  A little bit of  pancake syrup.  Ho, ho.  Look like human pancakes  in there.  We'll all laugh.  That would freak me out, though.  Oh, my stars.  We actually did use syrup  because...  It's sticky.  I hate sticky.  Yes.  Hate it.  And just the thought  of getting syrup.  Well, you got to put  some syrup in there  so all the other things  kind of...  That's pretty much  what it is.  It kind of stick to them.  It's the glue  on the 55-gallon drum challenge  because then when you  throw the chum in there, 
[00:50:00]  it's not easy  just to wipe off  your body there.  You're a booty man.  I can't wait  for the 55-gallon drum challenge  Friday  on the O.P.  Friday.  Friday.  Friday.  The day is finally here.  Let's go to Aaron.  Aaron, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, O&A?  Hey, bro.  Hey, did you guys see  that Monica Lewinsky  special last night  on HBO?  Yeah, that was kind of  a waste of time, huh?  Yeah, pretty much.  Man, she's stupid  just talking about  how the media  is hurting her  and everything,  but that's the only thing  that made her. 
[00:50:30]  She's such a hypocrite.  And every time a girl  asked a question,  she started crying.  If she thinks the media  is hurting her,  why doesn't she  just go away?  That's what I'm thinking.  I don't even want  to see her anymore.  She stops going on  Larry King  and Barbara Walters  and stops making  these documentaries.  Guess what?  We're going to forget  about her.  And I can't think  of her name  for free.  Don't anyone be fooled,  and I really don't think  there are many people  that are being fooled  by this.  She maybe wasn't  getting invited  to all those parties. 
[00:51:00]  She was getting invited  to the stories  in the newspaper,  settled down.  More important things  happened in the country  than a presidential hummer.  And she was starting  to feel a little,  hey, what can I do  to get invited  to the big parties again?  To stir up...  And get out  into the social scene.  To stir up a little  interest once again.  Well, I'll approach HBO  and go on this huge thing  where I come out on stage,  it's taped in black and white,  very dramatic,  and I'll say that  it's based on things 
[00:51:30]  I wasn't allowed  to talk about before.  You know why  it was filmed  in black and white?  Gag order.  How about a gag reflex?  Gah!  Gah!  Why?  It was filmed  in black and white  to hide the fat cells.  Yep.  Really?  Black and white  hides fat cells.  She did look big.  Yes.  Oh, when she...  They showed her  walk out on stage,  opening shot,  the stage hand there  goes,  hey, you know,  here you go.  It's time.  Opens the door.  They show her  from the back  walking out.  Her ass is so wide. 
[00:52:00]  You know,  she's got a cute face.  She's one of those girls.  Oh, why don't you lose weight?  You've got such a cute face.  But they showed her  from the back  and just a wide load.  Big ass.  All right.  The fact is  that she loves  the fact  that people are  talking about her.  She just wishes  it wasn't over a BJ.  Right.  She loves the attention.  She loves to think  that maybe it's something  other than that  that made her famous.  But the truth of the matter  is, no.  That's what it is.  She sat her fat ass  down on the stage. 
[00:52:30]  First of all,  they should have  just dropped in  Zyklon B  out of the goddamn vents  when she walked out  and gassed  everyone in that audience  because they...  She sits on the stage...  Except for the black dude.  The black dude  shredded her  and was the only one  brave enough  to confront her  and go out of her.  I'm just talking  about the opening  because she comes out  and what do they do?  Oh, I got the opening.  They all start clapping.  Now, when she walks  down the stage  and everyone starts clapping,  what are they clapping for?  I'm watching this going, 
[00:53:00]  oh, what?  Nobel Prize winner?  Did she cure a disease?  Is she a hero?  Did she do that?  No.  You sucked it.  You sucked it  and it belonged  to the president.  Technically,  they should be applauding that.  Every man should applaud that.  They're clapping over a hummer.  Don't discourage it.  She got the right ta-ta  but the wrong ho-ho.  Wow.  Let's hear the opener.  All right.  Jay wants in real fast.  Jay, I got something  for the 55 Drum Challenge  that's guaranteed  to make these girls puke.  What's that? 
[00:53:30]  Put in a taped copy  of Richard Voss' act.  Oh, you are cruel.  You know, today,  he's here, my friend.  Usually, he's not here,  but he's outside the studio  and he'll be able  to defend himself  in just a bit here.  He brought Patrice in  and I,  did they bring the sex tape?  Ask him if they brought  the sex tape.  It was the only reason  they were coming in today.  I just heard Patrice go,  oh,  sex tape.  Oh, he forgot the tape.  Oh, Patrice.  Oh, you in trouble.  He's going to tell me.  He's my point.  Oh, you're in trouble, Patrice. 
[00:54:00]  How can you do that?  Oh.  Damn.  See, they're already  arguing out there.  All right, Jay, thank you.  You're welcome.  We're going to get through  this Monica thing  and then we're going to  move on to some hilarity.  But we're going to get  through this.  We're going to turn  this thing around.  All right, I got the audio  of the opening.  You're talking about it.  Here it is.  Now, who would you imagine  walking out on the stage  when you hear this?  They're applauding over a...  Yeah, a Hummer.  Yes, yes. 
[00:54:30]  Applaud her.  Oh, my God.  She did such a good job sucking.  She sucked so good.  She's one of the best suckers.  Hi.  Hi.  Thanks all for coming.  Coming.  Thanks for coming, she said.  Do you hear that, hoping?  I guess really the best way  to do this is for you all  to know that you can ask me  anything you want.  I may choose to not answer it.  Could you suck me? 
[00:55:00]  And I hope this is informative  and I hope I'm articulate.  Oh, it's such pressure.  And I'm just really grateful, actually,  to get to do this.  And I have nothing.  Nothing.  This is really neat  and special for me.  So.  Here it is.  Okay.  It's neat and special for me. 
[00:55:30]  Neat and special.  And I finally get a chance  to talk about a Hummer  for an hour and a half.  At least you know  she's like every other fat chick.  She cries and she's aggravating.  Yeah.  She's got the most sought-after  mule in the country  and she's still belly aching,  you fat C.  Shut up.  She's always willing to please.  I absolutely hate her.  What a witch Linda Tripp is, too.  I never even realized.  She has cancer, doesn't she?  They had some great,  I think so.  Oh, my God. 
[00:56:00]  Oh, my God.  Oh, it's breast cancer.  Yeah.  Oh, God damn.  Yeah, she gets out on this stage  and she starts, uh...  It's sort of a Q&A.  The people in the audience  are going to ask her questions  and she's going to answer them  if she feels like it.  So, you know,  how does the president's sea taste?  Probably she wouldn't answer.  Probably.  But she's answering other things about,  how did it feel to be thrown 
[00:56:30]  into the spotlight?  Blah, blah, blah.  Those are the questions  she's answering.  Let's go to Michael.  Michael, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey, Michael.  When I was watching her last night,  I was waiting for Anthony  just for what he's doing now.  Yeah.  She walks in there,  walking away.  I mean, you put white shorts on her  because she used to  a 3-D movie on her ass.  Yeah, the ass was huge, man.  They should not have done  that rear-end shot  of her walking out.  Did you guys see the moment  with the girl,  some affair she had  with one of the guys  and that girl 
[00:57:00]  was in the same class she was  and they were bonding  with each other?  Yeah, a little bonding  going on.  Some whore bonding.  What part of the tape  was that, Florentine?  Was that in the beginning  or the middle?  Bottom line is,  I wasn't even, you know,  I was just looking at it  with such disgust.  I mean, I didn't even know  when it began,  when the middle was  and when the end was.  But when the guy  called it a BJ queen,  that was classic.  Yeah, it was definitely classic  because that's all she is.  That's all.  She's trying to tell us  that she's more than that  but no,  that's all you got.  Yeah.  And you're right,  Opie, 
[00:57:30]  about that one guy  who started ripping into her.  I don't understand  why you're doing this.  Why are you doing this?  Why are you making money  What are you doing here, sir?  I mean, I would have loved  to have been there.  I would have tore her a new one.  She started crying  at that point, yeah.  All right, guys.  Take it easy.  All right.  Later, man.  All about a homer.  Yeah, she started crying.  She got all emotional.  The thought that she believes  she should be famous  but not be famous  for what she's famous for 
[00:58:00]  is ridiculous.  Accept it, embrace it, suck it.  She really thinks  she has something to contribute  besides her fat mouth.  Her big, fat, wanting mouth.  All it is.  Bull off.  Cover the loneliness  with anything.  If it's not cake,  let it be a mule.  Monica, the reality is  that's all you have to offer.  That's right.  No one cares about you  as a person.  Keep going on Larry King  and Barbara Walters  and go on The View,  but the reality is  that's all you got.  Monica, does she honestly believe 
[00:58:30]  that anyone's watching these shows  and tuning in and going,  hmm, I just need to know  more about her as a person  or, you know,  I wonder what the trouble  that she faced  after this whole thing happened was.  No, the second,  the second my eye trains on the TV  and you're on,  I go,  that's the chick  that gave a hummer  to the president.  She sucks.  That's it.  That's the girl.  That's all anyone's thinking.  It doesn't matter  what you're saying. 
[00:59:00]  It's not about  what's coming out of your mouth.  It's about what went in it.  But you say that  like it's any other different  when any other woman  on the planet is sleeping.  You know what?  It's any other different.  That shows you I'm tired.  Oh, you stink.  I'm a little Korean nothing.  And she likes to think  that the president  really cared for her and stuff.  There was no loving involved.  I picture a scene  out of, like,  slap happy.  Yeah.  Just grabbing her head  and shoving it  and you get a puke,  you bitch.  Or cherry popper.  I'll call you Hillary 
[00:59:30]  and punch you  in the face.  All right.  We got a little more audio  from last night on HBO  with Monica.  And the president  was running back and forth  and he and I  had had this sort of  look flirtation  that had occurred  before then.  And it was nothing.  It was a flirtation.  You know,  I mean,  I said,  great.  Okay,  this is fun.  Sorry,  I thought that would be funny.  Usually fart is funny.  Sorry,  I hit a wrong button.  It escalated that day  and later that night  I was passing 
[01:00:00]  George's office  and you know how  when you pass an open door  you usually look in?  I looked in  and he was standing  right there  and he motioned me in  and I went in  and we started talking  and, you know,  I mean,  at that point  it was sort of obvious  to me,  you know,  there was this mutual thing  going on  and I was,  you know,  I sort of blurted out.  Try again,  check yes.  No.  No. 
[01:00:30]  And he smiled  and he said,  do you want to come  into the back office?  And  listen to how she's talking  like it's a goddamn  little liaison  in high school  or something.  You want to come  to the back office  and everyone's like,  woo,  the president wants  a hummer from you.  She is delusional.  Totally.  I'll talk for every guy  out there.  She gave that look like,  oh my God,  I think she's,  I think I could get  a hummer from her  and she's not going  to tell anyone.  Hey,  that's where the president  was wrong  and you know what?  If you watch the whole 
[01:01:00]  damn thing,  she didn't want to tell anyone.  It was that Linda Tripp bitch.  Linda Tripp,  her pal.  But that's the look,  Monica,  he gave you like,  oh my God.  Wow,  look at this.  We had,  she talks in terms  of a relationship.  Relationship?  No,  he's a married guy.  And he wanted  the hummer  and your mouth  was available.  Your mouth  passed by the door.  You opened the door.  You saw Bill Clinton.  He saw your mouth  and thought he'd  shove it in. 
[01:01:30]  He was so excited  knowing that he could  get away with it.  Yep.  Who wouldn't?  You know?  You're the president  like that.  You're in his situation.  You're married  to that  slob  Hillary  and then all of a sudden  you're like,  hey,  who's passing by the door?  Oh God damn,  look at that.  Of course,  if you're in his situation,  you're going to,  you're going to  get in here,  fatty.  Open it up, 
[01:02:00]  fatty.  You're going  bees deep.  My bees are going  to be right there  on your lower teeth.  Try not to eat them,  fatty.  He looked at her  and realized right away  that she had problems  in her past.  Yeah.  And the fat thing,  maybe a little self-esteem  thrown in.  A little self-esteem  problem.  Now the presidential's,  the presidential  sea is unleashed.  Not saying every girl  that's fat  has a self-esteem  problem,  but.  I'll say it.  They all do 
[01:02:30]  and if they don't,  you should.  Lose a few pounds  you awful slobs.  No one wants  to F you.  But you know what?  Some girls can't help it.  Yeah,  of course they can help it.  It's glandular  in some people.  It's glandular.  Is it really?  It's glandular.  Constantly putting cake  into your fat mouth  is glandular?  No, it's not.  Glandular.  No, it's not.  Glandular.  And the only thing  that's worse  are the little skinny guys  that follow them around  because their fear  of being left is there.  Chubby chasers.  Exactly, yeah.  They're so afraid  of being left  that they've been mothered.  Chubby chasers. 
[01:03:00]  Very popular.  Awful.  All right,  here's another clip  from Monica.  You testified  that you didn't have  sexual relations  with Monica Lewinsky  in the Jones deposition  under that definition,  correct?  That's correct, sir.  If the person  being deposed  touched the genitalia,  would that be,  under your understanding,  then and now,  sexual relations?  Yes, sir.  Yes, it would?  Yes, it would.  If you had a direct contact  with any of these places  in the body, 
[01:03:30]  if you had direct contact  with intent to arouse  or gratify,  that would fall  within the definition.  So you didn't do  any of those three things  with Monica Lewinsky?  You were free to infer  that my testimony  is that I did not  have sexual relations  as I understood  this term to be defined.  Including touching her breasts,  kissing her breasts,  or touching her genitalia.  That's correct.  There is a big part of me  that is so incredibly offended  by the way he described  what happened.  I mean, his testimony, 
[01:04:00]  he testified that I served...  Ah, shut up!  Are you kidding?  Shut up!  So offended.  Offended?  That just proves  he could care less  about you as a person.  You stupid bitch.  Trying to save his hide  is what he was doing.  There's one way to handle it.  If he really cared for you  or he was in love with you,  then he would have  went with it.  Okay, I touched her.  He didn't give a flying  crap about you.  This is...  You are...  She is one...  You'll lose it all!  She is one in a long line 
[01:04:30]  of mouths  that have been around  that thing.  Let me finish the clip.  Come on.  ...serviced him.  That's what he testified to.  So,  his testimony was that  he didn't touch me,  I touched him.  So,  while people couldn't call me  a liar and a stalker,  per se,  that didn't change 
[01:05:00]  a lot of people's image  of me being  a whore.  You know what the message here is?  Vote for Condit.  That's a guy  who knows  how to handle  these pigs.  Shovel.  Pass the lime, please.  Exactly.  Why?  You never dug a hole?  I'll dig a hole. 
[01:05:30]  I'll dig a hole?  I can never dig a hole?  All right, here's a...  I got lime.  I got lime in the car.  What the...  I had a hoof.  It was a hoof.  It was...  It was the frosted side.  Here's the phone call  to Linda Tripp, Anthony.  Yeah.  Listen to this.  Ladies and gentlemen,  the presidents  of the United States.  First time  I ever  looked into his eyes  close up  and was with him alone,  I saw somebody  totally different 
[01:06:00]  than I had expected  to see.  And that's the person  that's been there  at tender moments.  And he has been  distant and vacant  for me  for the past few months.  I'm nervous.  No.  Why?  He's not letting you in.  He's not letting you in  because it's dangerous  to let you in.  He let you in  and now he's afraid.  He's afraid.  Fear is the biggest motivator.  She fed my... 
[01:06:30]  Ugh.  Do you realize  that's how the women  talk to each other  on the phones.  All the gossip.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  The look was a sex-crazed  president.  Go ahead.  Go ahead, Jim.  I'm just thinking  it's two fat chicks.  Yeah.  This whole mess  was by two fat chicks.  If you're not shoving it  into your mouth  or if you're not sucking it,  you have to be talking  and telling tales,  don't you?  Yeah, she couldn't  keep her mouth shut  when it came to...  They never can  for any reason. 
[01:07:00]  ...to talking about this.  Awful slobs.  Everything would have been fine.  She keeps her mouth shut.  She doesn't tell that  Linda Tripp.  But no.  They had a relationship.  She's a little chubby.  She's got to tell  all her friends  how she's suckling.  You know what?  I don't blame her.  No?  The first thing I do  if I dump  is I'm on the phone  with Voss  before the car door  is closed.  So I can't blame her  for telling somebody.  I really can't.  Unless, of course,  it's him you're dumping on  and you just say,  Hey, no phone involved.  Yeah, that was just a little... 
[01:07:30]  Sorry.  All right.  Here's Monica  on the phone crying.  Some more bongo drums.  I can't take it anymore.  I know.  I know.  I just can't.  I just can't.  I just can't.  It's too...  It's too much  for one person.  Oh, it is too much  for one person.  Yes, it is.  It's too much  for one person.  Too much big  presidential see  in your face? 
[01:08:00]  Former president  was hung.  Was that what she meant?  I can't take it.  Why?  That's why  the spot on the dress.  Yeah.  It's too much.  It's...  Horse gag.  Yeah, you can...  Horse gag.  And there's the president  doing the old man moan.  What?  Oh!  Oh! 
[01:08:30]  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Monica gag.  And here's Monica  grabbed by the FBI.  We just got a couple  more clubs here.  So, um...  I didn't know  what to do  because I kind of,  you know,  in the movies  and TV,  after the person  says that,  they always say,  oh, okay.  So,  um...  So,  I...  I... 
[01:09:00]  I mean,  going through my mind,  I just...  I just...  I just couldn't...  Oh!  She's getting all  choked up again.  Don't just stare at it.  Eat it.  We're on your side, Monica.  Oh!  Thank you.  Oh!  Oh, God!  Oh!  We're on your side, Monica.  Every woman  that just heard that 
[01:09:30]  in their car  should be embarrassed.  We're on your side, Monica.  We're on your side.  Yeah, go up  to the married guy  and suck his C.  We're on your side.  You're a little bitch.  That's right.  You're a bitch  and I'd bet you'd like  to suck it,  wouldn't you?  Can I hear that again?  Dirty, dirty goo.  We're on your...  She's crying...  We're on your side.  Uncontrollably  and then there's a lady  in the audience  that goes,  we're on your side.  Why didn't she just say,  you go, girl.  You're a filthy whore!  Who wanted to get on HBO. 
[01:10:00]  Yeah, yeah.  That's why she said that  so her stupid face  would be on HBO.  And you know something?  She called all her friends  and go, I'm the one.  Did you see me last night?  I was the one that said,  we're all on your side, Monica.  Ugh.  Monica is so delusional.  What did she think  was going to happen  at the end of this?  It was going to be like  the last scene  in Officer and a Gentleman?  Clinton was going to walk in.  Clinton was going to walk in.  Try to lift up that chubby mess  and carry her out  as everyone clans.  You go, Monica! 
[01:10:30]  You go, Monica!  Or maybe she thought  that Clinton would hang himself  and Richard Gere  would call her a seat.  Where the eagle flies  from the mountainside.  You go, Monica!  You go, girl!  You go!  Yeah, and the president  was going to leave Hillary  and show up on Monica's doorstep  and say this.  I'll kill you!  Don't! 
[01:11:00]  I got nowhere else to go!  Okay.  Pull your flag down.  I got nowhere else to go!  You could go in my mouth.  I got nothing else.  I got nothing else.  That stupid movie  was on this weekend  and I had to watch most of it.  Oh, you did?  Oh, thank you!  Just to hear these clips, dude.  How great is that?  And then the end  where he picks up  Debra Winger in the factory. 
[01:11:30]  You go, girl!  You stupid faggot!  I got some audio  of Monica to Bill.  Got some funky tasting spots.  Yes!  Hence the...  All over that nice dress.  Here's that girl  in the audience again.  We're on your side, Monica.  Thank you.  I just...  I just...  I...  I just couldn't... 
[01:12:00]  I couldn't believe  what was happening  and I couldn't...  I just couldn't believe it.  I mean, it just didn't seem...  It didn't seem possible.  So I didn't know what to do  and I thought...  Well, if I go with them  at least I'll find out  what's going on  and then I can warn  the president.  You stupid bitch. 
[01:12:30]  It's a little joke!  Jesus.  That's the last thing  she said to the president.  All right.  And we picked out this clip  from the HBO special last night  just because it's Tom Brokaw  just stumbling through  another story here.  This is great.  Tom Brokaw,  you know,  he is the man  when it comes to NBC News.  Right.  And the guy cannot speak.  He cannot speak. 
[01:13:00]  He has that incredible lisp  where he cannot say his L's properly.  guess the way.  You never realize  how many words  have the letter L in them  until you can't say  the word letter L.  Listen to this.  It's great.  He almost avoids  another word  like you did  with that other clip.  Grab that other clip  while we're doing this too  because that's classic.  He tries to say  nine o'clock.  Nine o'clock.  We thought that this would be a day 
[01:13:30]  when the only big story  would be the arrival of...  We thought that this would be a day  when the only big story  would be the arrival  of Pope John Paul in Havana  late this afternoon  and then the unexpected. 
[01:14:00]  We will have more  on the Pope's arrival  a little later, but...  That wasn't a glitch  or anything.  He said it like that.  We'll have more  on the Pope's arrival  a little later.  We will have more  on the Pope's arrival  a little later,  but now it's on  to the president,  the intern,  the accusations,  and the denials.  And the denials.  And the denials.  The denials.  Monica  Walensky.  Oh,  Monica the whore bag. 
[01:14:30]  Monica the...  He cannot speak.  Classic.  Where's the guy  with the BJ Queen line?  We got that one, right?  Because that one is...  We're just about done here.  This guy...  We got two to go.  Another hush  falls on the crowd  after this question.  And then the audience  full of bitchy twat rags  who would shoot  this fat bitch in the head  if she decided  to pull a vacuum cleaner action  on their husbands 
[01:15:00]  or loved ones  are all of a sudden  very sympathetic to her.  How does it feel  to be America's premiere?  F***ing queen.  Oh, oh, oh.  Oh, oh, oh.  Oh, oh, oh.  Oh, oh.  Oh, oh.  Oh, my God.  Did he say that?  He didn't say...  No, that's not...  Now, that's not appropriate.  No.  Jenny, did he just say that?  No, I think he did.  Did he have the nerve  to say that to her? 
[01:15:30]  I can't believe it.  The gall, the audacity.  Here in front of everybody.  But is she the premiere...  Blah, blah, blah.  Is she the premiere...  Blah, blah, blah, blah.  Blah, blah.  Is she indeed...  Monica Winske,  the premiere...  Blah, blah, blah.  Blah, blah, blah.  Blah, blah, blah.  You should use your beep  and just say...  Blah, blah, blah. 
[01:16:00]  Blah, blah, blah.  Does she suck...  Cleep.  Is she truly...  Monica Winske,  the premiere...  Blah, blah, blah.  Blah, blah, blah.  Sucker.  Is she really a...  Sucker.  Only the president really knows  how good she...  A...  Or I could say suck.  Adrenaline is a very strong  drug. 
[01:16:30]  I...  You know,  I was pumped up.  And I would go home  and sleep very little  and wake up.  How do you even get to sleep  if you're obviously  that pumped up?  Well, the first night  I went home,  I came on the air  at about 9.15 in the morning.  Good boy, punch out Maverick.  He did not want to say  nine o'clock.  He quickly realized  in his head,  wait, I can't say o'clock.  I've been working on  a clock for quite a while.  I can't say o'clock.  It was nine o'clock...  Uh-oh.  Oh, 9.15-ish. 
[01:17:00]  Nine-ish.  I had Kate,  uh, Katie and Matt  on the Today Show  and then just stayed on  until about two in the morning,  went home.  And, uh,  you know,  it was fair to say  that I was wired,  so I thought the way  to deal with this  is with a big water glass  full of scotch.  And, uh...  This is a good message  for the young people out there.  Full of scotch.  Then I invited Michael Olinsky  over for a blah, blah, blah  to suck my c***.  Here's the BJ line again. 
[01:17:30]  How does it feel  to be America's premier  c*** queen?  You know what, Anthony?  Yeah.  They were very shocked,  but there was one guy  in the background.  Really?  Yeah, yeah.  I think we have some more audio  from a different angle.  Oh, isolated audio? 
[01:18:00]  Yeah.  So let's go to that question again  if we can, Rick.  How does it feel  to be America's premier  c*** queen?  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  You know something?  No.  If you play it again,  I think there's another angle,  another mic that picks something up.  Don't what disgusts me  is the whole crowd going,  don't answer that,  don't answer that,  don't answer it.  Don't answer it.  Don't play into that. 
[01:18:30]  Don't answer it.  Don't do it, Monica.  Don't do it.  Don't.  Don't you hate  supportive people?  You're a bunch of hypocrites.  You don't answer that.  You went to that theater  for the exact same reason.  It's a freak show.  You wanted to see  the big suck princess,  the one that got the biggest  one of them all,  the presidential schlong.  You wanted to see her.  That's all.  What do you have over there,  Ant?  I once heard Brokaw  try to say,  this is from  Jeremy Washington, D.C.  I once heard Brokaw  trying to say, 
[01:19:00]  Israeli El Al Airlines.  I thought his mouth  was going to explode.  Israeli El Al Airlines.  Ain't have a hard time  saying that.  El Al Airlines.  This is the official airline  of Israel.  Do you,  you had something else  in the background there?  Yeah, I think I heard  something else.  If we could boost that  little portion  of what I thought  I heard.  The crowd audio?  Yeah, yeah.  All right, that would be  part, remember this  for what do we learn?  Crowd audio. 
[01:19:30]  Part 11.  Yeah.  How does it feel  to be America's  premiere?  Is that supposed  to be sexy?  Oh, was that real?  Where did that come from?  Oh, no, really.  Now, I...  Hey!  Liar!  It's hurtful  and it's insulting.  Liar!  And it has...  Yes. 
[01:20:00]  Yes, it's hurtful.  The truth is, to me,  it's even more insulting  to my family.  Yes.  Then get off TV,  you bitch!  I don't actually know  why this whole story  became about oral sex.  What?  Because it...  I don't.  It was a mutual relationship.  Shut up.  So, I don't...  The fact that it did  is maybe a result  of a male-dominated society. 
[01:20:30]  What?  Um...  You might be better  poised to answer that.  Yeah, you got him back.  Everyone clapping  in that auditorium  should be shot in the head.  All right.  Absolutely.  Let me get this straight.  You're useless.  Let me get this straight.  Here is her logic  on this whole thing.  It has nothing  to do with oral.  It has nothing  to do with it.  It's because of  the male-dominated society  that it became that.  It was more  of a relationship. 
[01:21:00]  Yeah, because  you were going out  to the zoo together  and taking little trips  and building a relationship.  What was that relationship  based on?  Was it mutual respect?  And was it  that you had a good time  when you were together  no matter what you were doing  or where you were?  No.  It had to do with you  opening your mouth  and putting it inside,  moving your head  back and forth,  repeating that motion  until the president  was through with you. 
[01:21:30]  And then you either  gulped or spit,  but the end result,  you left.  Because he was done  with you.  But she has it  like in a whole  different light  in her head.  The relationship.  Natalie,  what's going on?  Dude,  that's fat hoe.  It's been like four years.  I'm from the D.C. area,  one of the handful  that you have.  I really love you guys.  But it's just like  sell your quilted handbags  already and shut up.  It's been like four years.  Well,  and they explained that  at the beginning 
[01:22:00]  of the segment.  In her mind,  she realized,  oh my God,  wait,  people aren't paying  attention anymore.  What other angle  can I give on this  one stupid thing?  No,  but being a female,  I've been in a situation  where there was a man  in a power position  and you...  Hey,  hey,  hey,  Watch that line.  That's all right.  Go ahead, Natalie.  I'm sorry.  It's just raging.  I mean,  I've met her a few times.  I've been at some of the events  having worked with,  you know,  as a liaison  and it's just,  she knew exactly 
[01:22:30]  what she was getting into  and she's just playing it out  years after years.  I just wish she'd disappear.  All right.  Thank you.  Later.  There goes Natalie.  It's not her fault,  though.  I don't blame Monica Lewinsky.  It's the public's fault,  man.  I mean,  if nobody paid attention to her,  she wouldn't do it.  Stupid HBO.  I can't get a special  but they give that fat thing.  Yeah.  Monica should be honest  with herself,  though,  and say,  hey,  I'm doing this documentary  because I want to go  and party some more  with the celebrities  and the stars  and I want to get  a bunch of free ass.  Right.  That's what it's about. 
[01:23:00]  You should watch the special  just to see that,  that guy,  that black guy  sounded like he was  West Indian or something.  He just shredded her.  He was the greatest.  There's no way  to come back from that either.  No, he really did.  Shirley, what's up?  Oh, hi, guys.  Yeah,  on the Monica Lewinsky thing,  it's just like,  she's just a stupid  leaky bitch.  I'm sorry.  And the whole thing  is just so embarrassing  to the whole female  half of the race here.  No, it's not.  That's what you guys do.  Oh, my God.  I mean,  I sit there  and you guys are like,  see how the girls 
[01:23:30]  are like fat girls.  They got to talk  about how they just...  We're pretty much  abusing the audience  for supporting her  in that situation.  That is fine.  That is fine.  I'm sure that most  of that audience  was female  and it's ridiculous  and it's embarrassing.  I hope all those women,  I hope all the women  in that audience  that are married  or in a relationship  are placed in a position  where their husband  is having it done to him.  Exactly what Monica did  by some little fat chick  like Monica  and then let's see  that woman go, 
[01:24:00]  yeah, we're right by...  We'll stand right  by you there, Monica.  We're behind you  all the way.  Yeah, oh, this poor girl.  Yeah, let's see  how you feel  when it's your boyfriend  or husband  and that fat slob  is on the business end  of his stick.  Thank you.  And don't take it wrong.  No one's knocking fat girls.  Once in a while,  you hit a dry spell  and fatty is perfect for that.  And they try harder.  They do try harder.  Thank you, Shirley.  A little attention. 
[01:24:30]  I think we have  one more clip in.  This is the guy, right?  Yeah.  Here's the guy.  Miss Lewinsky,  this is probably  a tougher question  than you've been asked.  I don't mind  your making a living.  I don't mind  making a lot of money,  but I find  sort of the whole  set up fairly dishonest  in this sense.  I don't think  we've really learned  much of a lesson  at all  from what  you could possibly  offer  for the nation.  I mean,  the nation was 
[01:25:00]  really plunged through  a really wrenching  constitutional crisis.  I find it disingenuous  to suggest  that this is  the most appropriate  way for you  to end a living,  approaching HBO  to broadcast  essentially  a spin story  about your life  as the true  sort of clearing up  of the misperceptions  of what happened.  Why do you think  this is a spin story?  Because you've given us  this self-serving,  self-supporting 
[01:25:30]  drivel, frankly.  and what's going on  in your life today.  I find it extremely,  you know,  I guess,  presumptuous  and disturbing  that we're all  participating  in this one-sided  problem  where you're making  a lot of money  and so on.  I find it really  upsetting.  Why did you come today,  sir?  Oh, boy.  Yeah, I can't answer. 
[01:26:00]  I'm not talking to you.  I'm just curious.  I mean, you obviously...  It was built,  it was built as  a way of clearing the air  and clearing some  misperceptions  and to tell the truth.  I found it anything,  but I think you've  completely obscured  the meaning  of how everything  went down.  I think you've  sort of made this  more about you  and your pain  and not about  your own agency  in having all this  happen.  You are not  an unwitting,  silent,  passive person 
[01:26:30]  who got caught up  in something much  larger than you were.  You are someone  who did manipulate  events,  who knew that you  were signing  a false affidavit,  who knew that you  were playing  in the highest  levels of power  in Washington.  I just want to say  that I support you  100%,  and I don't think  anyone should judge you  unless they've gone through it.  Who's that bitch?  Unless they've gone through it.  A white girl.  Who else?  A little blonde  white girl.  How great was that guy?  Yeah, that's pretty smart. 
[01:27:00]  Yeah, support her.  We support you.  I wonder if you support her  if the same thing  happened to you.  Yeah, if you were  in Hillary's shoes,  those big fat-holding  fat feet shoes,  that guy shredded her  and she had no comeback.  Why'd you come here?  Nothing to say.  It was great  just to look at her  fat Christina Ricci face,  clueless,  with a tear on it.  It was just great.  Fat and dumb.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  And she was all concerned  about her family.  That's what it was, too.  You see, the biggest pain 
[01:27:30]  was that her family  had to be put through this  and all the jokes  that go along  with doing what she did  and how her father  was very upset by it.  Yet, there she is  on HBO again  talking about it.  That means, you know what?  You know what?  Aunt and I weren't going  to talk about Monica  and Hummers today.  So now all the Hummer jokes  come back out again.  Don't they, Monica?  You stupid bitch.  We have audio.  They did give a private screening  to the father  before it came out. 
[01:28:00]  Turn it off.  Turn it off.  Turn it off.  Listen to the pain.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Turn it off.  Turn it off. 
[01:28:30]  Oh, yeah.  Is that the best freaking thing?  I love that.  The George C. Scott  sitting there  watching his daughter  getting skewered  by two guys.  James makes a good point.  I would plug him down here,  but I don't know  if we'll get away with it.  He goes,  how come Brokaw  can't say O'clock,  but he can say...  What?  The C word?  The clock without the L.  Because it's the L  that he has a problem with.  O'clock.  I can say O'clock.  Yeah.  O'clock.  All right. 
[01:29:00]  Oh, I can't say that.  I can say O'clock.  O'clock.  O'clock.  O'clock.  O'clock.  All right,  let's get out of this segment.  So there it was,  pretty much.  Yeah.  Well,  glad to have you back,  Monica,  back in the,  back in the limelight  where she belongs.  Guess those handbags  weren't selling too well,  huh?  Oh.  Oops.  Oops.  What?  What?  We've got a great bit  that we could play here.  What bit? 
[01:29:30]  The dice asking her a question?  Huh?  Oh,  yeah.  Find that really fast.  I'll play,  I'll play this little thing too.  Now squirm in your seats.  Come on,  squirm.  And deny,  two,  three,  four,  deny,  two,  three,  four,  deny,  looking good people.  Get fit for deception  with Bill Clinton's  Lies of Steel.  All right,  people,  lie,  lie,  lie,  when your bold-faced lies  go bad  and you're feeling the burn,  Bill feels your pain  and helps you shed 
[01:30:00]  unwanted sincerity  and unsightly self-respect.  And you'll lose more than that.  Just listen.  I used to have a lot of trust  and credibility,  but not anymore.  The second I put in  the Bill Clinton workout video,  that all went away.  Lies of Steel.  It shrinks accountability  in just four short hours.  But wait,  there's still more.  Listen to this special offer.  Order my four-hour videotape,  Lies of Steel,  and get the joy  of phone sex  absolutely free.  Lies of Steel.  All right,  let's see your smirks.  Smirk,  one, 
[01:30:30]  two,  three,  smirk,  a spooge production.  Deny,  deny,  deny.  Not bad,  right?  I forgot about that.  A blast from the past?  Wow.  I don't even know  what this is.  We haven't heard this  in like two years or so.  Two and a half years.  All right,  we're just going to play this  going to break.  I don't even know  if it's going to be good.  It's what?  What if Dice  or Yoshi  or Brokaw  interviewed Monica?  Yeah.  Huh?  Wow.  This goes way back  and Yoshi was an old character  that was like  the old  Asian delivery guy  on his bicycle. 
[01:31:00]  Yeah.  Back in the old days.  Check this out.  Opie and Anthony?  Hello.  All right.  Well,  tonight's a big night  for Barbara Walters.  I know a lot of people  are sick of hearing  about Monica.  Trust me,  so are we.  Yeah.  But we think  that Monica  picked the wrong person  to interview her.  Yeah,  what do we want?  The cushy little  Barbara Walters interview.  She's been kissing her ass  on The View,  too,  saying that she's  such a sweet girl  and, you know,  she's a victim  and all that 
[01:31:30]  happy horse crap.  You think Barbara's  going to ask Monica  if you were a tree,  what kind of tree  would you be?  Well,  she'll do the same thing.  She does in all  the interviews.  Get her to cry  a couple of times.  And what is the over-under  for crying tonight?  Oh, my God.  Forget about it.  First five minutes.  I'm thinking  Monica cries  four different times  in two hours.  Four times in two hours?  First one being  within the first five minutes.  Within the first five.  Yeah.  All right.  You know,  and honestly,  I think it's going to be  pretty boring TV tonight. 
[01:32:00]  Yeah.  You know exactly  what to expect  when Barbara Walters  interviews someone  of high-profile status  like Monica Lewinsky.  Right.  No surprises.  No surprises.  And we have come up  with a list of people  we wish  would have  interviewed Monica.  Yeah.  We have a couple  of people in mind.  Sure.  It would have made  much more riveting TV.  Yes.  For example,  Anthony,  Andrew Dice Clay.  Now,  that would be an interview.  Could you imagine  if Andrew Dice Clay  interviewed Monica tonight 
[01:32:30]  instead of Barbara Walters?  I'd watch that.  I'm just trying to think  what that would sound like.  Hmm.  Hmm.  All right.  I'd like to welcome  this whale to my show,  huh?  And you know you're a whale  because I could see  your blowhole.  Yay!  So,  you're sucking  Clinton's  right?  Does he blow his  on that chubby face  of yours?  Or does he pull out  and  all over your  big  huh?  Come on.  Answer the question.  Answer the question, 
[01:33:00]  you whore.  Answer the question.  Oh,  look,  now she's going to cry.  Get up,  Barbara Walters,  you're going to cry,  huh?  You'll look at her  a little bag.  Answer the question.  What,  your mouth full?  You whore.  Look at his  bag,  huh?  I don't want you  on my show.  Get the  out of here,  you  man.  Man.  See,  now two hours  of that,  I would  sit home  and watch  that  without a doubt. 
[01:33:30]  Let's rock.  You guys are able.  You sound like  a fruity  stick in the mud.  I hate you.  Sew up  that worthless  slot.  The Opie  and Anthony  show.  Here,  check it out  the Opie  and Anthony  show.  A couple  phone numbers  in the New  York area.  877-692-1027.  Anywhere else  outside of New  York,  you could use  this number.  866-277-4. 
[01:34:00]  Wow.  I know,  right,  but not magazine  cover worthy,  I don't think.  What?  Nothing.  What?  Stephanie,  what's going on?  Nothing much.  Hey.  What's up?  You tell me.  I make it  illegal.  It's a sin.  It is such a sin.  I guess in some  states it's illegal.  Yeah,  in some it is.  But so is  jaywalking.  Who cares?  How old are you?  I'm 19.  Oh,  not illegal. 
[01:34:30]  What do you think  is going to happen  to you if you get  caught doing it?  No,  I'm not saying  anything.  And I just wanted  to know if it was  illegal.  Because I'm trying  to make that.  My friend is like,  no,  it's not illegal.  What state are you  in?  Massachusetts.  Is it illegal  in Mass?  Yeah,  it is.  No,  in that goddamn  state.  Probably is.  They got the most  party-hardy  goddamn senator  in that goddamn  place.  And they're all  uptight.  It doesn't really  matter, 
[01:35:00]  though,  Stephanie.  Okay.  Stupid question.  Thanks.  Well,  are you going to be  given a hummer  in the middle  of Faneuil Hall?  Yeah.  Oh,  well,  then maybe you  need to know  the answer  to that question.  No one's going to  bust into your  house and see  if you're  giving a hummer.  All right.  Don't worry  about that.  Eight.  Dave from Jersey  got it,  and I didn't  get it. 
[01:35:30]  In the studio  today,  Anthony,  Rich Voss  said,  Patrice.  Hello.  I don't even  know why  we're inviting  them into  the studio.  They forgot  the tape.  They,  they,  they,  they,  oh,  man,  this idiot,  he's supposed  to tell,  he knows he's  my mentor.  First of all,  you didn't tell me,  you asked Patrice  the other night  to bring the  tape.  The tape?  I had nothing  to do with the  tape.  No, no, no, no.  I don't have  the tape.  Oh, Jesus.  It was a personal  first of all.  They didn't bring  the tape.  It's the retarded,  defiant ones.  First of all,  stupid here 
[01:36:00]  was supposed  to bring the  tape.  He was late,  okay,  because first  of all,  he made me  wait,  what,  an hour and  15 minutes.  You know,  black people  are never on  time.  You were  supposed to  be,  you know  what,  I swear  to God,  New Year's  Eve,  you guys  saw it  January  3rd.  First of  all,  okay,  that was  it.  Okay,  really suck.  Shut up.  Why are you  going off?  Why are you  going off  January 3rd?  I have  nothing to do  with the  he's so dumb 
[01:36:30]  he's scared  to shut up.  Listen,  you know what,  Opie,  I didn't think,  I wasn't  thinking about  that.  We were  talking about  the tape  at the  cellar,  weren't we?  I want to  know about  the tape.  The tape,  man.  What's the  tape?  Do you know  what Patrice  said to me  as you were  out in the  hall?  He said,  look,  if I don't  bring the  tape now,  at least I  have a  little shot  to get  into the  studio.  Listen to  what I  said.  Opie,  listen to  his,  look at  his stupid  show,  you know,  I forgot  to tell you,  but at least  I can get 
[01:37:00]  back in  again.  Do you see  this?  Does anybody  know the  pantomimes  that realize  he's an  idiot?  He just,  he came here  to plug a  dumb show  for Tuesday.  Pantomimes.  You know  that he  comes to plug  show.  I barely  plug.  I'm your  great-grandmother.  What's that?  You're here  to plug?  Slept with an  eggplant,  and that's  why you're  dumb.  He's  pantomimes.  His  great-great-grandmother  slept with a  moor,  and that's why  he's stupid.  And what's  your claim  to fame?  You had a  cousin on 
[01:37:30]  the Evolution  of Man  poster?  Oh,  Jesus.  If you steal  another Godfrey  joke again  on the air.  That was  mine.  That was  not Godfrey.  All I know  is it was  new.  I was  excited to  hear a new  one.  Yeah,  and it  wasn't his.  And it  wasn't even  his.  I know.  No,  it was mine.  Boss  practices  his  improvisations.  That's  what he  stinks.  Shut up.  What is  this tape?  The tape,  man.  What's  the tape?  R. Kelly,  it went to  what?  You were  telling me  it went  gold on  the street  already.  Platinum.  Really?  The sex  tape. 
[01:38:00]  Oh,  my God.  He's got  the tape.  You got  the tape?  And so I  ran into  him at the  comedy store.  Give me a  little description.  What's the  rundown on  the tape?  Well,  I'll tell you  why.  Let me  tell you  why he's  in trouble.  You don't  have the  tape,  do you?  You never  had the  tape.  I had the  tape.  I'm telling  you.  But listen,  I don't  want to  say I  got it.  I got it  just in  case.  I mean,  I saw  it.  Right.  I don't  got it.  Right.  I mean,  give us  that look.  Do you  have the 
[01:38:30]  tape?  No.  He's shaking  his head  now.  Okay.  All right.  What's on  the tape?  His wife's  messed up,  man.  I mean,  he's doing,  he's messed  with four  girls on  the tape.  The first  two,  you kind  of go,  well,  I'll be  in trouble  too.  You know  what I  mean?  Because one  girl's doing  them,  he's going  nuts deep  on them.  Right.  She's young.  Then the  next one is  like,  oh,  man,  he's getting  off with  this.  But then  the third  one is 
[01:39:00]  in trouble.  It's the  R. Kelly  sex tape.  So the  first two,  you're like,  eh.  The first two  are like,  you know,  troopers.  You know  what I  mean?  They're like,  I don't  know if  they're young  or not,  but they're  like Laura  Ingalls  comes in  or something.  The third  one is  like,  yeah,  no hair.  Oh,  Jesus.  She's like,  thanks,  thank you.  Thank you.  She's like  pebbles. 
[01:39:30]  She's got  on G-string  diapers.  Trouble.  Oh,  yeah.  What do  you do  with her?  So that's  why you  didn't bring  the tape  in.  Because  of the  third  girl.  He told  me about  the tape  and I  begged him  to drive  me around  the city  the other  night.  He took  me to  four different  porno  stops  looking for  it.  Really?  Gold on  the street.  Platinum on  the street.  If you tried  to download  it on  the internet,  I found  out that  it's going 
[01:40:00]  to come  up.  You're  downloading  kitty  materials.  Oh,  boy.  But they  were selling  it right  on the streets  in the  streets.  Got that  R. Kelly.  On  point.  How?  Really?  Yeah.  Doing the  deed.  She's  peeing,  he's  peeing.  Well,  we can't  say that  on the  air.  We get  in trouble  for that.  Well,  there's  things going  on with  discipline.  A little  discipline.  A little  discipline.  Some of  that yellow  discipline. 
[01:40:30]  Back and  forth  discipline.  Back and  forth  discipline.  That's  all right.  We got  plenty of  delay.  Old  man  discipline.  You said  when you  did it?  Oh,  my God.  Couldn't  squeeze.  Stop.  And you  go,  oh,  and it  starts  again.  Tom,  what's  going on?  Kelly got  kidney stones.  What's  up,  Tom?  Hey,  boss.  Oh,  here we  go.  No,  no,  boss,  seriously.  You called  in last  time for  a moment  in England,  right?  Yeah.  You're  ripped.  Yeah.  You should  have left 
[01:41:00]  the show.  You should  have never  came back.  You should  have ended  your career  because you  stink.  I stink.  You came  on the show  and you  said first  of all  seven times  in seven  different sentences.  And you  know what?  What's  even said  is you  suck.  All right.  Talk  to you  later,  dad.  Mike,  what's  going on?  Yeah,  what's  going on,  fellas?  We were  just talking  about that  today.  I work  uptown,  and I  was told  you can  get that  from a  couple  of  vendors,  you  know,  the  guys  with  the  bootleg  tapes  on  125th 
[01:41:30]  Street.  So I'm  going to  be taking  a ride  out tomorrow  and see  if I  can pick  up some  educational  film.  Oh,  really?  And if  I do  come across  it,  I will  let you  guys  know.  Well,  Patricia  has  seen  the  tape.  Really?  Yeah.  And he  has  problems  with  things.  I heard  it's  ridiculously  obvious  how young  she is  from a  couple  of guys  that say  they saw  it.  It's  like  Robert  room  goes  to  late  night  TV.  I can't  believe  she  was  nice. 
[01:42:00]  There's  no grace  on the  field.  It makes  for a  better  game.  Well,  sorry,  if you  do  get  this,  please  don't  even  think  of  putting  an extra  copy  in the  mailbox  for me.  I'll  send it  up there  with some  Aussie  bootlegs  for you  there.  Take a  drinker.  I'll  bring it  to  town hall.  Remember,  town hall.  Why  is he  taping  this stuff?  What's  wrong on  so many  levels?  Take care,  fellas.  Your people  and your  video cameras  are going  to get  you in  trouble.  People  always  tape  and  stuff.  Stupid,  stupid  people.  Shouldn't  tape  things.  Robert,  what's  going on?  Yeah,  I don't  know. 
[01:42:30]  This is  a really  shitting  bowl  from  Mohegan  Sun.  I saw  a boss  on  Saturday  night.  I want  to know  what's  up with  that  chick  in  the  front  row.  He  got  so  flustered  with  her.  That  was  Friday  night,  I got  a car.  She goes,  I know  I've been  in the  backseat  and it  threw me  off.  And all  I know  is she  bothered  me and  I lost  $500  shooting  craps  because she  was holding  on to  me and  bothered  me.  That's  what  happened.  That's  why.  Oh,  so that  was  before  the  show.  It's  supposed  to be  a funny  story. 
[01:43:00]  I'm  telling you  what  happened.  It  bothered  me.  I  shot  craps.  I  lost  $500  and I  was  miserable.  I  heard  that  was  the  worst  show  I  ever  invented.  I  want  my  money  back.  Thank  you.  Who  put  this  guy  through?  Wow.  That was  a little  rough.  I  know.  This  lady  was  following  me  around  the  casino  and  I 
[01:43:30]  out  of  crap  sometimes.  I  can  tell  you  a  great  story  about  the  hotel  where  you  know.  Lee,  what's  up?  Hey,  listen,  just so you  know,  for the  girl from  Massachusetts,  Stephanie,  there is a  law on the  book saying  any sexual  position besides  missionary with  man on 
[01:44:00]  top is  illegal.  Oh,  yeah?  In  Massachusetts.  In  Massachusetts,  it's the  truth.  It's back  from the  Jordan  age or  something  like that.  Well,  of course  it  is.  Of  course  it  is.  Doesn't  matter.  Kennedy  killed  his.  I  actually  was  wondering,  do you  guys have  Stephanie's  phone to  my  name?  No,  she's got  a website  and you  can just  email her.  I will  do that.  It's  vavixen  at  aol.com.  The  eyes are  one,  though.  Va  Vixen.  All  right?  Hey,  you guys  suck.  Thanks,  man.  All right,  Lee.  Got to  apologize to 
[01:44:30]  some of  the cities,  Opie.  They're  getting a  crackly  show and  it's  dropping  out because  Pete  Johnson  told me  it's  the  satellite.  We're  having a  problem  with the  satellite?  There's  a problem.  I'm  getting  the  Pete  Johnson  space  shuttle  up.  I'll  grapple  the  satellite  and  repair  it  myself  in  low  earth  orbit  with  my  chin  dildo  on.  He's  the  man.  You  want  him  on  your  side.  So  if  you're  kind  of  hearing  us  in  and  out,  that's  the  problem.  It'll  be  like 
[01:45:00]  Space  Cowboys,  the  go  up  into  space.  I'm  the  head  engineer.  Bummed  we don't  have  the  tape,  Anthony.  Yeah,  well,  now it  kind of  sounds a  little,  you know,  sick to  be looking  at that.  It's  newsworthy  though,  Ant.  Is that  what it  is?  Oh,  he's  dialing  your  phone  number.  You're  going to  make a  call?  Yeah,  let me  make a  call. 
[01:45:30]  I'm  going to  make a  quick  call.  What  race,  creed,  and  color are  the  girls?  All  black.  All  black  girls?  Well,  the  black  girls  mature  quicker  than  the  white  girls.  I  heard  that  study.  Not  the  third  one.  That's  what I  said.  A  four-year-old  black girl  is like  an eight-year-old  white girl.  What does  that mean?  What do  you mean  by that?  That's  backwards.  A  four-year-old  black  girl probably  already has  eight kids  or  whatever.  Jesus.  What is 
[01:46:00]  wrong  with you?  No,  that's  well,  statistics.  Will,  he's quoting  statistics now.  Where do you get  these statistics?  Can you come in  the city and bring  R. Kelly with you  for the radio?  Are you listening to  102?  Listen to 102.7.  102.7.  Bring,  could you bring the  tape in 45 minutes?  Can you be at the  radio station and  bring the tape?  They really need to  sit at the table  where they're  sending me and 
[01:46:30]  boss out of here.  Well,  the guy's right  though.  I can't say that.  Listen,  listen.  Can you bring it?  He speaks the truth.  Can you bring it?  He realized like,  uh-oh.  I got it.  What's the,  what's the,  that guy's right?  Rick will take  care of it off air.  Okay,  hold on.  While we figure  that out,  he's going to tell  you right now.  Rick,  get curdled milk  girl in here.  Oh,  she's here.  Did we curdle 
[01:47:00]  some more milk?  Oh,  we did?  Did it curdle  nicely?  It smells awful.  Bring it in.  The new batch  of milk.  Make sure we  got a garbage  bag.  Curdled milk  girl has arrived.  I think she's  coming from Philly  today.  Did you guys  prepare this,  what,  an hour ago?  All right,  lift that up.  Oh,  God.  Don't,  don't,  don't,  don't.  Get it away from me.  Wow.  Get it away from me.  Patrice,  we got a girl  coming in.  She's going to  chug that.  Take a look.  What smells worse,  that or behind 
[01:47:30]  Voss's ear?  She's going to  chug that to be  in the 55-gallon  drum challenge.  No,  no,  keep it away.  Keep it away.  Keep it away.  I shan't be  participating in that.  Get it all set?  How many spots  do you have left  for that?  How many spots  left?  This will be  the last girl  to qualify.  We're going to  do it Friday.  Okay.  The 55-gallon  drum challenge.  We're waiting  for an answer  from Patrice's  friend there.  Okay,  if you can,  you can.  I think...  Oh,  I hear.  It's rush hour  now. 
[01:48:00]  Yeah,  did you hear it?  Yeah.  It's rush hour  now.  Yeah,  but he's  taking the subway,  isn't he?  All right.  I mean,  if you can,  it's in the city,  but if you can,  you can.  If you can't,  then I won't  see them anymore.  He's Haitian.  Tell him to swim.  No,  he said you're Haitian.  He said swim over here.  All right.  All right,  look,  goodbye.  Tell him we'll give him  until 5 to 7.  He's not doing it.  He's not doing it?  He may not do it.  No,  well,  look.  Thank you how we got  Curled Milk Girl  here to see.  Thanks for having us.  Take care.  Come on, 
[01:48:30]  boss.  All right.  You want to take a break  and get the Curled Milk Girl  on you?  Yeah,  I want to see what  she's all about.  All right,  we'll do that next.  O.P.  Anthony.  1-0-2-7.  W.A.W.  Yeah,  you're checking out  the O.P.  and Anthony show  for today.  In studio,  Rich Voss  with Patrice.  Hello.  What's up,  y'all?  And Patrice 
[01:49:00]  forgot the tape,  but we're looking  at stills of the tape.  We're looking  at stills of R. Kelly.  On the internet.  The fun and hijinks  he's having.  He's taking a peek  at the camera  as he does  what he has to do.  Yeah.  Isn't that hilarious?  He is face deep.  Face deep.  Salad tossing.  Oh,  yeah.  Absolutely.  What a trooper.  Ha, ha, ha.  Kelly's a trooper. 
[01:49:30]  Delicious.  Nothing wrong  with that,  isn't there?  Yeah, yeah.  See, hey,  didn't I tell you,  right?  You see how that  couple of these  stills builds  your evil up?  You go,  hey,  what's wrong  with,  what's he thing?  Well,  they only showed  the two girls  that look  of age.  They don't show  the one that makes  you want to go  wash up.  No, huh?  And they don't say  that the other one  was saved  a two-mile walk  home from school,  either.  It's very narrow-minded  the way they're  alluding to this.  They cut out  the part  where he burped  her. 
[01:50:00]  That's the one  they edited.  At least it's  a new joke.  That old gag.  All right,  well,  Tracy's here  and she wants  to drink  the curled milk.  Yeah,  and this has been,  what did we put  more lime juice  in some milk  and leave it out?  Yeah,  well,  the milk we let  curdle all weekend  long turned  into cheese,  a solid mass  of cheese.  That was our punishment.  It actually turned  into cheese.  We left it out 
[01:50:30]  for the whole weekend  and it turned  to cheese on us,  so we had to get  a whole new  load of curled milk  on it.  Why should I be  a black girl?  Why?  Because cheese.  What's up,  Tracy?  Nothing much.  What's up?  You're from Philly?  South of Philly.  South of Philly.  Drove all the way  here to try  to qualify  for the 55-gallon  jump challenge.  Patrice,  you should have  seen what we  were doing  to white girls  this past week.  Please don't  embarrass this  black girl  in front of me.  Let me leave.  Why are you  doing this?  Hold on, 
[01:51:00]  Patrice.  I gotta let you  know what we  did to white  girls the whole  last week.  We threw  them in dumpsters.  We filled  up super soakers  with lamb blood  and unloaded  on these chicks.  And what's  your point?  We all do  that to white  girls.  This is a  black girl  right here.  Don't do  this.  We are so  equal opportunity.  Look at that.  Is that  your husband  and kid  out there?  Yeah.  Oh,  God,  no.  Is he  white?  Last time  I chatted.  You have  a white  husband?  Yeah,  what's wrong  with that,  Patrice?  What's wrong,  boss?  No, 
[01:51:30]  not really.  Think about it,  Patrice.  The race is  getting along  here.  All right,  all right.  All right?  Let Mel  Carter drink  the goddamn  beer.  Oh,  man.  Give me  a break.  Wow.  How  way is that  to talk to  this?  I'm only  joking.  No,  I'm a bit  bigger than  most of the  girls that  come in here,  but most of  the black  guys are  big.  No.  We've seen  a lot bigger.  Actually not.  Actually not.  You're just  fine.  You're all  right.  You're right  in that  average range.  We'll show  you big.  You haven't  been in any 
[01:52:00]  R. Kelly videos,  have you?  No.  Just thought I'd  ask.  All right.  Hey, Rick,  do you have the  video of us  throwing the  girl in the  dumpster?  That never  made the air  Friday, but  Steve from  foundrymusic.com  has it.  Got her down  to her bra  and panties,  threw her in  the dumpster.  She started  rolling around  in the mess.  We found a  really messy  dumpster.  This is the  white girl.  Are you sure?  Oh, yeah,  from Cleveland.  And she was  shaking like a  leaf when she  got out of  the dumpster  because she  thought rats  were in there.  And there  could have  very well  been rats  in there.  Did you get  the video,  Steve?  Yeah,  it's all up  now.  It's all up  on foundrymusic.com? 
[01:52:30]  Yeah,  people are now  going to think  that you're  talking about  the R. Kelly  video.  No, no, no,  no, no.  And they're  pounding the  site.  No, no,  no, no,  never.  The video  of the girl  in the dumpster  with her  brawn panties.  The clips  look good?  Yeah,  they were.  We actually  spent about  15 minutes  priming her  to think  that there  was a rat  in the dumpster  before we  threw her  in there.  Oh,  that's good.  Yeah,  she was shaking.  Yeah,  she was great  when she finally  got out.  She passed  the audition.  She's going  to be in  the 55-gallon  drum show.  Friday,  Patrice,  we get to  torture girls  all day long.  We take  the girls, 
[01:53:00]  we put them  in 55-gallon  drums,  those big  steel drums,  and we bolt  it shut.  There's a few  holes cut in  there,  just so they  can't breathe.  More so,  so we can  throw disgusting,  heinous stuff  on the side  on top of them.  You know  what's fun  about it?  I know,  you look  a little puzzle.  What?  Why is the  R. Kelly  tape sound  sound?  This is fun  stuff.  The screams  that you hear,  the echoing  screams coming  out of the  barrel,  they'll make  a killer 
[01:53:30]  jump for joy.  Yeah,  most of them  get out of  the barrel.  Yeah,  they go,  oh,  we do it  right here.  Right here.  Oh,  yeah.  Do you ever  throw any  live stuff in?  We throw in  the last  thing we  threw in  last time  we did  this,  which really  separated  the girls  from the  what?  No.  Hissing  Madagascar  cockroaches,  which are,  you know,  they're huge.  They're about  three inches 
[01:54:00]  long,  two inches  wide.  They hiss,  they go,  can you get  the audio  of the hissing  cockroaches,  Rick?  Yeah,  see if we  get that out.  You got to  cue it up  to the actual  hissing.  The screams  that came out  of those  barrels when we  threw that in,  they felt the  legs on them.  And the  hissing.  And we  upped the ante  this year.  What was this  for?  What did they  win?  Well,  this year  it's for  $2,000.  Two grand.  Tracy,  Cash,  people get a  little nervous  hearing us  describe some  of the stuff  of the last  time we did  this.  for drinking  of the milk.  She just  gets to  qualify for  her chance  to win 
[01:54:30]  the two  grand.  Qualify?  Yeah,  she's going  to just  qualify.  Tracy,  you're going  to do that.  You're really  dumb.  Where's the  husband?  She's from  Philly.  She's from  Philly.  Stupid  Keith  from his  dumb  town.  I want  to see  the husband.  Bring the  husband in  for a second.  Let me  see this  guy.  Guaranteed  white trash.  How much  you bet?  I guarantee  you're  pissing  off a  sister.  All  black guys  get like  that.  Right.  Black  chicks  go crazy 
[01:55:00]  when they  see a  black guy  with a  white  chick.  I  know.  He came  in with  his fist  balled up  with  his  awful  beard  and  mustache.  I  chose to  be with  my  husband  instead  of  somebody  like  him.  How  long  have you  been  together?  Four  years. 
[01:55:30]  How  old?  How  did  that  go?  We  don't  talk  around.  Oh  really?  Exactly.  I told  you.  What did  I tell  you?  What did  they do?  This is a  story to be  told.  Get that  mic up.  Someone  worked  that  mic.  What does  this do?  Help us  out.  This is just  a lesson  in how  doomed we  are as a  society.  I love  getting this  out.  How do you  guys get  together first  of all?  How tall  are you? 
[01:56:00]  We need a  visual.  That's  it?  How tall  is that?  What do you  do?  Five?  Five?  Five?  Wow.  You sound a little  taller on radio.  He's a good foot  taller than you.  All right.  So they can play  long and all.  All right.  How did you meet  Tracy?  Best friend.  She was dating  his roommate.  He was in the  army.  He's in the  army.  Best friend  dating roommate.  Okay.  Best friend  black?  Yeah.  Roommate white?  Yes.  Yes.  Wow.  How about that? 
[01:56:30]  Huh?  Starting to trend.  Look at Patrice.  He's just all pissed  off.  Patrice, I admire  this guy.  I'm going to be  able to get  the sisters when  they're running  off with the  white guy.  I don't really  mind that.  I just knew it  was just an awful  little white  trash love story.  Oh my God.  How can you  white trash?  I knew it.  Because his parents  don't speak to him  no more.  By the way,  we don't really  know this guy.  So whatever you  want to do is  quite fine with us.  So what?  So you guys?  I'm telling you,  every black guy  has this attitude.  But you know,  the first white girl 
[01:57:00]  that comes along  with him.  Oh yeah.  Very true.  The prize.  When this white  girl that comes  along,  I stick him  in a gallon  drum and throw  roaches on him.  That's what I do.  That's what we do.  The prize.  Yeah, he says  that now.  Alright, so the  army thing was  going on,  your roommate.  So you hook up.  My best friend  wanted me to get  him out of the  room so they  could have some  sex.  Yeah.  And that was  R. Kelly, I think.  No?  Okay.  Just trying to  work his name  in every ten  minutes.  Alright, so you 
[01:57:30]  leave with this  guy so your  roommate could have  sex with his  friend and then  what happened?  We weren't.  No, what actually  happened is we all  met up at a gas  station and I  come rolling up.  My roommate  didn't have a car.  Her best friend  didn't have a car.  We come rolling up.  Her car, my car.  We come rolling up.  I looked up.  I got out of the  car to go meet her  and she's like,  I'm like, hey, I'm  Keith.  She's like, yeah, I'm  Tracy.  So I talked to my  boy Jason.  I said, Jan, I  don't want to be  here.  I'm going to just  drop you off and  I'm going to roll.  She was like, I don't  like I really wanted 
[01:58:00]  to be there.  Oh, really?  So neither one of us  wanted to meet each  other at all.  And how long did it  take for you guys to  have sex?  How long?  After that point?  Until a teddy bear  beer.  What?  What's that?  We're down in  Georgia.  You know, they sell  beer in the grocery  stores.  And we walked to the  grocery store one  night.  This really sounds  like how slavery  got started.  And then as the  bull came along.  I want the teddy bear  beer.  She drank some  free teddy bear  beers.  And that was that. 
[01:58:30]  All right.  All right.  So you guys hooked  up.  Are you married?  No, I would  never.  I want to hear what  happened with the  parents, though.  Oh, yeah.  Let's get to the  parents.  What happened with  the parents now?  You guys, you fall  in love eventually.  Yeah.  And so he's from  Maryland.  We come up to visit  his parents and I'm  like eight months  pregnant.  And you're like  black.  Eight months  pregnant.  Yeah.  Did your parents  know she was a  black girl?  Yeah, they know.  Oh, OK.  Yeah, like.  Oh, so they were  a little happy about  it, but they knew.  They weren't happy  about it.  So at this point, 
[01:59:00]  they were still  having a little bit  of an open mind.  Like, all right,  well, let's wait  and see, right?  Well, I think it  was more like,  we'll wait and see  how long this lasts.  Oh, OK.  What happened  when you told them?  What happened  when you told  your parents?  No, she was  eight months pregnant,  so they didn't  have to say nothing.  They just showed up.  No, I mean,  there had to be that point  because if they already  knew he was going out  with a black girl,  there had to be a point  where you had to go,  hey, it's like this.  You know, she's a black chick.  And what did they do?  I just love hearing  how Southern people  react to this.  Did they say, like,  what's happening  or they didn't care? 
[01:59:30]  Well, there's really  not much they could say.  You know, I was in a  different state  and they were up there  and it was, you know,  they're going to deal  with them on their own.  Oh, well, that's  fine and dandy.  Why, why, why,  hello, Kizzy.  I mean, uh.  So, so did they say  anything like,  we don't want to see you  anymore if you're going  to be with Tracy  or what?  No, it wasn't  anything like that.  It was pretty much  after so much stuff,  I said, look,  don't call us  and don't come around  anymore.  There you go.  Oh, look at that.  Yeah, I'm here to stay.  There you go. 
[02:00:00]  Mm-hmm.  All right.  You ever have to drop  anybody for using  the, dropping the  M-bomb there?  Um.  Like when you're just  out without your wife  and also, you know,  you kind of look like  you can put on some  Doc Martens and stomp  some black people.  You kind of got that  look about you.  Doesn't he look like  a skinny?  Doesn't he look like  a skinny?  It's my skinny.  This is mine.  I really can't wait  to this.  It has to fail.  Daddy, mommy,  listen, I made a big 
[02:00:30]  mistake.  So you ever get  like some guy you  work with and stuff  and go,  God damn them  nuggers.  Or something you  got to go,  hey, dude.  One of my first  two weeks at work,  I was riding with  a guy when I was  in training.  Yeah.  And he said  something.  He let the N-word  fly.  Uh-oh.  And I said,  pull the truck over.  Oh, Jesus.  He pulled the truck  over.  He said, what?  I said, you ain't  going to say that.  I'm not going to  hear that anymore.  Uh-oh.  Nobody at work  knew.  Right.  You know, we  weren't married yet  when I first moved up.  Let the guy go,  relax. 
[02:01:00]  God damn,  why'd you show up  tight?  No, you heard a lot  in the area where I  work because being  in such a remote  county down in  Maryland.  Let's get a mic up  to his.  Wow.  Were you racist  before you met  your wife?  Now, you be honest.  Did you go nigger a  lot before you met  your wife and that  love story happened?  Tell it true.  No.  Was you and your  friend going to  build a cross on  the way?  No.  Is everybody  nigger's sip?  Sip. 
[02:01:30]  Sip.  Everybody's nigger's  sip.  My wife.  I love running  into black guys  like this.  It's so funny  because they all  have the same  reaction all the  time.  Why are you  out of hate?  Yeah, what's  the matter with  you, Patrice?  You can see  two people in  love.  This is the  ideal society  here.  People are  getting along.  It doesn't  matter.  Color doesn't  even matter.  Hate is not  the answer.  All right.  And aren't we  all united to  hate the  goddamn  towel heads  now anyway? 
[02:02:00]  That's right.  That's right.  Filthy, dirty  Arabs.  You know what?  I apologize  for all this.  All right, Rob,  what's up?  He brought an  Arab in here.  A big  different story.  Rob, what's up?  Hey, guys, how  you doing?  I just thought  it was funny that  Patrice was  making fun of  this guy because  he don't talk  to his parents  anymore, calling  him poor white  trash and stuff.  When most of  the black guys  in the ghetto  don't even know  who their daddy  is.  It's who's your  daddy, who's  your daddy,  who's your  daddy.  Ah, shut up.  Yeah, and how  do you really  know who your  daddy is?  Because your  mama told you?  You idiot. 
[02:02:30]  All right, so  she's going to  drink the  curdled milk,  Anthony, to get  into the 55  gallon drum  challenge.  Can't wait.  Have you seen  the milk?  No.  You want to  see it?  Not necessarily,  but...  We better get  a...  We listened  about it when  we were getting  ready to go  into the  Lincoln Tunnel.  Yeah.  Who said  that they bet  that I wouldn't  show up?  Well, because  you blew us  off Friday,  that's all.  Yeah.  So we were  thinking you were  going to blow  us off today.  I apologize,  you're here.  It's all cool  now. 
[02:03:00]  It wasn't my  fault.  Our daughter  had strep throat.  Strep throat?  All right.  Mary, uh...  Oh.  Mary has brought  in the  curdled milk.  Tracy, what do  you think?  Uh, can I  chase it with  tequila?  Do we have  tequila, huh?  That'd be good  with curdled  milk, yes.  We don't have...  I don't think  we do.  We can put  some in the  back.  We can put a  shot of tequila  in the milk.  The lime's  already in there.  Make a new  drink.  Look at Stinky  running down the  hall.  He's going to  look for  or something.  Yeah, could you  peel after the  bucket? 
[02:03:30]  Ah.  Yeah.  I can't even  imagine drinking  that.  No, no.  But it will  earn her a  spot.  That's fine.  How much, uh,  how much are you  going to drink  there, Tracy?  Um, how much  do I need to  drink to qualify?  Well, you  need to do a  little more than  a few sips  there.  A couple chugs  nice.  Right?  A couple chugs  in.  Yeah.  Big gulp.  Big gulpful.  Why?  Yeah, a couple  chugs.  Can't watch  this.  I just can't.  It's fine. 
[02:04:00]  Mary, is it  all clumpy?  It's not clumpy  like the other  one.  It's not like  cheese, but.  Let me say.  Oh, man.  I think it's  adequate.  Oh, boy.  It's not  completely crude  and disgusting,  but.  Oh, it's  starting to smell.  Well, it was  curdled milk.  I don't know  if it's curdled  enough.  Well, what the  hell are you  going to do  about it?  Put it in  the microwave  and curl it  in the microwave.  No, that  makes it warm  and delicious.  Look at the  first one. 
[02:04:30]  No, that  is not  doable.  It is.  It turned  into cheese  over the weekend.  That's bacteria.  That looks  like Grinch.  Yeah, that  one's bad.  That's bacteria.  Ah, stinky.  You got  the tequila?  Nah.  You got  rum and  vodka.  Some absolute  and some rum.  What do you  think?  You look  like Caudi.  She looks  like a rum  girl.  A little rum?  Absolute.  Absolute?  All right.  Can we put the  absolute in the  milk?  Oh, wow.  Sure, why not?  She's saying 
[02:05:00]  sure, why not,  Anthony?  Wow.  Should I add?  Huh?  Hey, sure.  Go ahead.  Have fun with it.  Thank you.  Yeah, you better  get it a bucket  just in case.  You never know.  Get it a bucket.  I'm going to throw up.  You never know.  All right, we're  getting the waste  basket.  Mary's adding the  absolute to the  curdled milk.  For flavor.  It's tasty, too.  Just like candy.  That's a lot of  vodka in there.  I'll give you a  cup, too, so you  can have a chaser. 
[02:05:30]  All right, and  then Mary's filling  up a separate cup  with vodka.  For the chaser.  So Tracy has him  holding his nose.  As a chaser.  Tracy is preparing  him by drinking a  nice, cold Sam Adams.  Come on, Richard.  She's not going to  puke.  She's not even  going to puke.  This milk isn't  even that old.  It's still cold.  The milk is still  cold.  She's chugging it  already. 
[02:06:00]  Oh, Jesus Christ.  God, we didn't  chugging it.  Wow.  I told you it  wasn't bad.  She's fine.  She's chugging it.  It has vodka and  lemon and lime in  there.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  She's making some  weird face.  You all right,  Trace?  Uh-oh.  Did you feel any  chunks of it slide  down?  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  It was chunky.  That's when I had  to stop when the  chunks fell down.  Did you drink  enough there,  Rich?  No.  Oh.  Yeah, you got  one more in there.  What's wrong?  One more chug in 
[02:06:30]  you there, Tracy.  Because the chunky  stuff's got to go.  This is for the  55-gallon drum  challenge.  You got to get  the chunky stuff  that we will be  doing Friday.  You shouldn't have  put the liquor in  there.  Why?  I don't know.  I just felt like  saying something  that was dead  air.  Oh.  I had nothing  funny to contribute.  You got to have  a little dead air  every so often.  And Tracy's going  for chug number  two.  Sometimes it's  better.  She's making  some weird faces,  but uh-oh.  That was...  I think...  Oh, I think  that one was...  Oh, God.  No, you're fine.  Swallow it.  She's dry heaving. 
[02:07:00]  She got it.  She swallowed it.  Her eyes are  watering a little bit.  She's dry heaving.  Tracy, you all right?  Damn.  What do you think?  Oh.  What was the problem  with that one?  It's getting chunky.  It's getting chunkier.  Chunky milk.  Oh.  Ah.  She has one more  chunk to go in.  Well, we made a line  on the cup.  Two-thirds of the way.  Two-thirds of the way.  One more.  Close your breath  and chug it back.  Two-thirds of the way.  You'll be fine.  Nice big milk.  Get a good one.  It's only milk. 
[02:07:30]  It's been there for two hours.  Yeah, it hasn't been there  that long.  Yeah, it's just chunky.  The milk is actually  pretty fresh still.  You can feel it sliding down  like oysters.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  She's trying to eat it again.  No, she's fine.  She's not going to puke.  Chew it up.  Chew it up.  Oh, God.  She's trying to...  Oh, no.  There she goes.  Are you all right?  Oh, no.  You okay?  Yeah, she's okay.  It's only milk she's using.  Uh-oh.  Here's the...  Here's the...  Did she get it, Rick?  Rick, I think that's fine.  Yeah, she did.  Yeah, that's fine.  That would have been perfect 
[02:08:00]  if she could have done that  out of the car window  and then said,  Could you take me home?  Nice.  There it is.  She is the latest  and last contestant, right?  Yeah, that's it.  For the 55-gallon drum challenge,  which we will have Friday.  Yeah, Eric is saying  that all she did  was chug yogurt.  Eric.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Listen, if you get spoiled milk,  that's yogurt.  Yeah.  You know, it's got a lot  of bacteria in it, you know?  I love that people say that.  Yeah, it's just like...  Oh, yeah.  It's just like popping open  at Dannon's  and digging in... 
[02:08:30]  It is yogurt.  Leave it for five more days.  You'll have yogurt.  Hey, asswipe.  You know what happens?  She drank it and puke.  You eat yogurt,  you don't puke.  Tell me why.  You do.  No, you don't.  Shut up.  You don't know  what you're talking about.  It was kind of anti-climatic.  Why?  It was what?  It was kind of anti-climatic.  What is yogurt made out of?  But she...  It's...  Boiled milk.  But you know what?  I rest my case.  Oh, jack off.  Watching out, Maverick.  Oh, what a jack off.  She was dry heaving  and she puked a little bit.  There was vodka 
[02:09:00]  and lemon in there  and the milk was  a little too fresh  because we couldn't use  the one from over the weekend.  It was definitely curdled  and chunky.  Yeah.  But not as good  as it could have been.  It's...  No, well, she woofed.  But she woofed  and she's in.  Yeah.  All right?  Yogurt.  I don't know why  people say that.  Do you know it's...  Sour milk is nothing  but yogurt.  All right.  Chug it down  out of your fridge.  When you see bad milk,  when milk is sour,  drink it  because it's just yogurt.  I think they do  something to yogurt  to make a little different  than sour milk, 
[02:09:30]  you jackass.  Let's go to Eric.  Eric, you're next  on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Hey, what's going on?  All the way from Columbus.  What's going on?  Not a lot.  I just wanted to call  to explain that I am  a 29-year-old white man  who is engaged  to a 31-year-old black woman  and, Patrice,  you are a racist scumbag.  Wow.  You know what?  You're right.  You're right.  Patrice is a creep.  Thanks, Norton.  You rule.  Thanks, Al.  White trash.  What's that?  Shut up.  You stink.  Oh, that's not even nice  for such a funny guy. 
[02:10:00]  Oh, well, that was that sarcasm?  You and your black wife  be sarcastic  as your role-playing slave master.  No, they're just  slave master going on here.  Hey, you guys want  to go to Cleveland?  I think your manhood  is threatened by white men.  Huh?  I think your manhood  might be threatened  by white men.  Is that why you're so hostile?  Everybody's still trying  to be psychological.  I think that's what it is.  Oh, listen to this.  Another guy like this.  You know what that is.  I don't sound like that, Patrice.  Get up.  All right.  Hey, are you guys  road-tripping to Cleveland?  Because it's true.  Yeah. 
[02:10:30]  You are?  Maybe for Norton's show.  I hope so.  I got one of the first tickets.  Yeah, we got to work...  Oh, thank you, sir.  We got to work that out,  but I think we're going  to make it up there.  All right?  You guys friggin' rule.  All right.  Thank you, guys.  He fades in and out  of crackers.  You hear me?  You guys rule.  Yeah?  You guys rule.  I don't think  friggin' rule.  Ah, shut up.  All right, Tracy, you're in.  We'll see you Friday.  Thank you.  That wasn't that big  of a deal, right?  Oh.  Huh?  It was bad.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[02:11:00]  You'll have a lot more fun Friday.  That's nothing.  Watch what happens Friday.  Any final words  for Patrice?  Get over it, dude.  If it makes you feel better,  Patrice,  we'll put her in...  We'll keep her out  of the whites-only barrels.  We'll have one...  Black only?  Yeah, for her,  and then all the rest  will be whites-only.  Jesus.  You know she drinks  curdled milk every day  at a trailer home.  And fill it up.  What do you do?  That's why he kept saying,  honey, it's all right.  You know you drink that 
[02:11:30]  all the time?  Drink that curdled milk.  It's all yogurt.  Look at that now.  The little daughter's  coming in.  You know what happens  when you mix the white people  and the black people together?  You get what they call  supermodels.  Right?  You're doing a little  investment there,  aren't you?  You know Patrice.  She's beautiful.  She's a beautiful  little girl there.  Look at that.  No R. Kelly video jokes.  Anybody.  Just shut up.  I see you looking. 
[02:12:00]  All right, Justin,  what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, is Voss still there?  Yes.  Hey, Voss, I was on your  website.  Is that really your apartment?  Yeah, why?  It stinks.  All right.  You have pictures of your  apartment on your website?  There's some stuff I feel like.  What's the website?  RichVoss.com.  Thank you.  He built everything  in his house.  Everything.  It's awful.  I mean, the furniture's  older than his friggin' act.  Yeah, it is.  It's old.  I like old stuff.  What do you, you shop at Ikea? 
[02:12:30]  I like old furniture.  Can you talk, you have a  typewriter?  You have a little TV  with huge rabbit-eared  antennas?  Is that true?  Where is it?  Oh, he's on a 12-floor walk-up.  Hey, Voss, where is it  on your site?  Under what?  Under pics.  Under pics.  All right.  Yeah, number six.  Number six.  Page six is the apartment?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  It looks like an old,  it looks like an old 50s apartment. 
[02:13:00]  It's like my grandmother.  There's a Victrola in that picture.  It's awful.  What is it like?  Is that like old furniture?  What's wrong with that?  Look at that pathetic little wall unit.  It's old because he found it  in the garbage.  Dude, look at the pathetic wall unit  with that 1975 stereo system  he's got in there.  And he does have it in Jersey,  not Park Avenue.  He does have a TV  with rabbit ears.  This apartment looks like  the apartment out here.  He got up to go look  at his own dirty, filthy apartment.  Look at that.  You sure that's mine?  This is yours.  This is the apartment  that you find after 
[02:13:30]  like your great aunt dies  and you have to go in  and clean up the apartment.  Yeah, I got cool stuff.  Art Deco stuff,  some antique stuff.  Dude, you got rabbit ears  on your TV.  That's from something else.  Check out the typewriter.  I haven't seen a typewriter  since like the 80s.  No way there's a typewriter.  There's no typewriter in there.  Is there really a typewriter?  There is.  No, I have a computer.  I have a laptop.  Check by.  I think it was by the TV  there's a typewriter.  Ah, the site's getting jammed.  Yeah, now it's crashing.  Damn, man.  Look at us crashing your site.  All those stupid pictures  at eatabullet.com  of your apartment. 
[02:14:00]  All right, Jim.  All right.  All right, let's take a break.  Thank you, Tracy.  Okay.  There she goes.  Tracy, our latest contestant.  We're going to see you Friday  for the 55-gallon drum challenge  up for grabs.  $2,000 for the winner, Anthony.  You don't like that  mixing of the races there, Patrice?  What happened?  He got it with the hate traces.  He should turn around  and look right at me.  Hey, Norton.  Yes, sir.  When are you coming to Boston?  April 5th, sir.  I'm doing the Avalon Ballroom. 
[02:14:30]  All right, man.  You rule.  Thank you.  Thanks, guys.  I don't mind when a white guy  goes out with a black chick.  That doesn't bother me  as much as when a black guy  goes out with a white chick, right?  What is your problem?  And I'm really tired.  That's a racist.  I'm really tired of his  Christopher Reeve hairdo, too.  He really stinks.  Who, me?  He can't see it.  He got a curl in the front  like he's Superman.  He really...  You are an awful Jew representative.  You stink.  First of all, Sukul,  you're wearing a microphone, okay?  Oh, hot...  Oh!  What is...  What's going on? 
[02:15:00]  Oh.  You never do.  You stink.  No, Anthony asked if he was upset  about black and white people  going out.  See, you like more of the separate...  You like everything keeping separate?  You know, whites with the whites  and blacks with the blacks?  Eh, not really.  I don't...  I just find it hard to believe  that they could actually  get together like that.  Especially that white-fresh guy.  He was...  Woo!  You know why?  You would think the first fight,  and I know a lot of stand-up comics  have done this,  that first fight,  what's keeping him  from just going,  you... 
[02:15:30]  Yeah.  You...  Yeah, exactly.  You mother...  Damn!  Both legs cut off  due to diabetes  starting to jerk.  That's why you...  That's why you get  sickle cell anemia.  Oh, God.  God damn it,  I'm tired of you.  Oh, here comes Tracy.  Does he refer to you as...  Does he refer to her  as his little niggret?  Oh, man.  His little nigglet?  Holy Jesus.  My little...  You're my little nigglet. 
[02:16:00]  Coochie-coo.  No, he doesn't.  Oh, ho, ho.  I look.  I look.  Tracy's having a problem  with Patrice.  I have a big problem with him.  I don't, Tracy.  Don't have a big problem with him.  Tracy, if you were  to go out with a black guy,  would you go out with Patrice?  Yes, she would.  No.  You better not say no.  No.  No?  You really?  You wouldn't go out with me?  No.  I'm not cute enough?  No.  Your bubble-head husband  is better looking than me?  Um, yeah.  You ever gone out with...  Yeah.  You ever gone out with black guys?  He's the first  Oh, yeah? 
[02:16:30]  Yeah.  And what's the difference?  Our electricity's turned on.  Fox, you are horrible, man.  I mean, you know what?  She could have started  that hit white guy first.  She went right to  the opposite white guy.  The southern guy.  Not the color white guy.  She went right to  Jesus Christ.  He looks like  kind of a skinhead.  He's got the skinhead look to him.  He's got the short hair.  He's a military guy, though.  Yeah, but, you know,  you get a white guy like that,  you know, I thought  at least you'd go Sicilian first.  Yeah, yeah.  Wean yourself into it. 
[02:17:00]  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.  It would be cool.  He'd come in.  Okay, he's the regular white.  Okay.  But he was straight, you know.  Boss, this is not your couch, right?  Stop it.  Am I looking at your gold couch?  Oh, he really stinks.  Tell me,  you're kidding.  Look at...  This is your grandmother's...  Oh!  And he redid everything.  And that's what he has  his daughter sleep on.  Look at him.  They don't.  Did they refurbish that?  He has an orange couch  and a raspberry couch  side by side.  That looks exactly like  my old nanny's apartment 
[02:17:30]  except the painting  you have over here.  She had one that you  plugged in and Venice lit up.  That's a slave.  That's a waiting room.  Oh, that's a sick fact.  That's a waiting room.  That's a waiting room couch.  At a funeral home.  Look at it.  Look at that couch.  It's gold,  button-tucked back.  It should be covered in plastic.  Do you have a magazine  next to it?  The old wood table.  Look at you.  Very classical guy.  The armoire.  Where'd you buy  this stuff from?  He found it.  Garage sales? 
[02:18:00]  Oh,  antique stores.  Refurb his antiques.  He'll go to that  antiques TV show  with his armoire  and they'll tell you  it's worth nothing.  It's crap.  You wasted your time  hauling it.  Look at him.  He's pointing at stuff.  He's all proud.  Is that the thing  your TV's in?  The armoire?  Yeah.  It looks like a...  I thought it was  some crappy wall unit  you got at Ikea.  Has one of your dates  ever commented  on the apartment?  Just saying,  ever.  Just curious.  Maybe you ever went  on a date  and a gal  commented on the apartment. 
[02:18:30]  A couple weeks ago.  What happened?  I went out with this girl.  I went to school  and she goes,  a guy 44  shouldn't be living  like this.  She was  trashing my apartment  and I was...  All that apartment  is missing  is a velvet tiger picture.  I just got  your first apartment  on your own now.  You're 37.  I've been living  on my own  since I'm 18.  You just got  your first apartment.  You're asking me,  what do I get  a coffee maker  and toilet paper?  I'll just bring up  everybody's personal business.  I know.  You just finally  got your first apartment. 
[02:19:00]  You moved out  of your house.  Look at you.  You're a bubble neck zero.  You said bubble neck.  I never claimed  to be anything  but a nothing  but at least  I don't have photos  of my apartment  on my website.  Yeah, because you  never had one.  People are horrid  to each other.  Tracy, we're all  cool here?  Oh, yeah.  Don't pay attention  to him.  He's player-hating.  As a black lady,  do you feel safer  coming in the Lincoln  Tunnel or the Holland?  Oh, I get you.  It doesn't matter. 
[02:19:30]  Oh, the Lincoln.  I get it.  Hey, did your husband  go out with any  black chicks before you?  No.  No?  No.  Wow, and again,  like that,  you'd think he would  have started with  somebody a little more  mocha,  a little more  coffee latte.  You know what?  He's shaking his head  yes behind her, though.  Oh, really?  They really are  completely opposite.  Completely opposite.  Like, you know,  you figure,  okay, if I'm going  to start off  with a black girl,  it's not going to be  like, she's officially 
[02:20:00]  a black girl  and he's like a white,  you know,  he's, you know,  they just...  You went out  with a black chick  before your wife?  Yeah.  Oh, you did?  Okay.  In the Army.  Uh-oh.  He never told me.  Where's the strangest  place you've ever  made Whoopi?  Wait, she's a little  pissed off.  You never told her?  Uh-oh.  You never told her?  On my softball  coach's porch.  Oh, you had some  sex with her then.  Yeah, we kind of  broke the railing.  We broke the porch.  Uh-oh.  Uh-huh.  Wait, they had sex 
[02:20:30]  on a porch,  and broke it.  But what about  this other black girl?  Because it's obvious  she wants to know  about it.  Oh, God, boy.  She knew about it.  Don't even start.  You are horrible.  You're a horrible,  horrible human being.  You should be shot  and stomped  in the town square.  Let's hear about  the other black girl.  Yeah, who was the other?  We never really  went out and did much.  We just hung out  and we both lived  in the same barracks 
[02:21:00]  building when I was  in the Army.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Look at how she's  looking at you.  Mm-hmm.  Now she's giving you  that look.  Wow.  Tracy, comment?  Were you disappointed  in his size  as a white guy  when you're still...  Yeah, you back him?  Actually, to be honest,  on either side,  it can go either way.  All right.  And I guess  he's doing okay for you, huh?  Yeah.  Yeah, representing white man. 
[02:21:30]  You know, nice.  White guys lead to coochie, right?  Oh, God.  Not this joke.  Oh, God.  He's been waiting  a long time  to use that joke  on our show.  He stays down there.  Oh, boy.  Not that gag.  Oh, boss.  Only if I tried.  When you wrote that joke,  your furniture was new.  What, Tracy?  What are you saying?  Since I found out  that he dated somebody else,  he's going to be down there 
[02:22:00]  a whole lot more.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, kid.  As if that's punishment.  Oh.  That's the same.  You know what George says?  Looks like a wallet.  All right.  That joke was brand new  when his armoire  had provisions in it.  All right.  Tracy and husband,  thank you.  It's in Laura Ingalls' room.  Yeah.  Thank you.  Good luck, y'all.  What an uplifting couple. 
[02:22:30]  You know,  it really shows you  there is hope  in this world.  Isn't it?  Don't you think?  Ask her if they have  different fountains  in the house.  Jeez.  Different bathtubs.  They get on the bus,  like,  all right,  I'll see you  when we get off.  That is awful.  Jerry from Edison 
[02:23:00]  says,  is that Voss's apartment  on the set  from The Honeymooners?  Todd,  what's going on?  It was nice  actually having  Tom and Helen  in here,  though.  That was good.  Hello?  Todd,  what's up?  I just wanted  to ask if  I'd have gone  with Betty  and Barney Hill. 
[02:23:30]  I wonder  if this is  Patrice office.  What, Todd?  Patrice and Voss.  What's that?  What?  I said,  I wonder if Patrice  is pissed off twice over  because not only  is Norton funny,  but he's also white.  I don't think  Patrice has a problem  with Norton.  No,  he's one of my best friends.  Really?  Yeah.  They're just not funny.  I thought Voss was unfunny,  but Patrice is just racist.  I don't know.  He is really racist.  That's the way  you come across.  And where's the insult?  Wait, sir,  are you white or black? 
[02:24:00]  I'm white.  Do you go out  with a black girl?  No,  not at all.  Then what do you care?  I'm just saying.  Shut up.  Go to a Hillary meeting,  liberal.  Shut up.  I'm going to be calling  to say that Voss  isn't funny,  but you know.  Okay.  Well,  that goes without saying.  It's not his brand  of comedy.  That's what it is.  It's not his brand.  He's racist.  I like black comedy  just as much  as I like white comedy.  Oh, my God.  You have no charisma at all.  You really suck.  And he's just a lump  of nothing sitting there.  You really stink.  You are not interested.  I can hear people  sleeping at home. 
[02:24:30]  You suck.  Bad radio.  Bad radio alert.  All right, Todd.  Bye, dum-dum.  We're going to take a break  and we'll regroup here.  Yeah, we'll go to the FU line.  Thanks for calling  and here's the Opie and Anthony  FU line.  The Edison Bob  from Elizabeth  with a big FU  to all New England  sports teams.  Not only did your  football team cheat  in the playoffs  to get into the Super Bowl,  but you cheated  in the last two seconds  by not kicking off  to the Rams.  You are not pretenders  to the throne.  You are phonies  on the throne. 
[02:25:00]  Then you had the nerve  to chant  New York sucks  in your parade.  Remember this.  New York at its worst  is a billion times  better than New England  at its best.  Once again,  a big FU  to all New England sports.  Next message.  Yeah, this is Ty  from Cleveland.  I want to leave  a big FU  to the short yellow bus  who I had to follow  all the way to work  and I ended up  being 15 minutes late  and getting written up.  F*** you.  Next message.  Yeah, this is Jay 
[02:25:30]  from South Jersey.  I want to give  a big FU  to my best friend's  girlfriend, Val,  for totally messing  with his head.  Hey, Val,  why don't you do us  all a favor?  Take one of your  daddy's guns  and put it up  to your head  and pull the trigger.  Go F yourself,  you F*** skank.  I hope you die.  Next message.  Yeah, I'd like to give  a big FU  to my friend Tom  who still owes me  40 bucks  and is turning off  his cell phone  and not answering  his home phone  like a little pun.  Hey, end of message.  Opie and Anthony.  At the last supper,  they would have 
[02:26:00]  wiped their asses  with the tablecloth.  That's just what  Christ wanted.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Is this for shock factor?  Hang up on this bitch.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Tracy has left the building  and she was pretty much  puking the whole way  out the door.  It's catching up to her.  Like some of the things  that people eat  around here at times  makes them instantly vomit.  That's something  that's going to stick  with you a while.  Maybe make you puke later. 
[02:26:30]  Do you get sick of that?  Like worms or anything?  Can you get like  people sick of that?  Ah, who knows.  Do people get worms anymore?  Maybe in your apartment.  That whole 50s motif  might induce polio  or what other diseases  they got back then.  I have a Pika balloon  follow me around.  Hey, I think  I got the vapors.  Oh, so we got somebody.  Cool.  Ah, Jay, what's up?  Jay.  Yo, what's up, fellas?  Hey, man.  What's up, bro?  You guys rock.  Norton, you're the best. 
[02:27:00]  Listen, you twirls,  I almost crashed  my friggin' car  because of that.  What?  Hey, the Polk,  there's what?  That Nokia thing.  I thought my phone answered.  I wasn't looking,  I wasn't going to call.  Your phone's ringing?  Well, you shouldn't be  answering phones in the car.  Yeah, don't answer your phone.  What are you calling us for?  Yeah, I don't know  what he's talking about, Ian.  Ah, James, what's up?  You guys get me  every goddamn  damn effing time with that.  Why?  Yeah, what?  Oh, what?  Uh-huh.  I'm a tool.  Uh-huh.  And the guy next to me  was like,  oh, it looks like God. 
[02:27:30]  What a dick.  I call back,  call back from way back.  Ready?  Yeah.  I'm not a wimp.  I'm not a nerd.  A nerd.  A nerd.  I love you guys.  Get those to,  where is that?  What is that?  God, I want to hear that.  I'm not a wimp.  I'm not a nerd.  I'm not a nerd.  I want them  off your station.  It was that bitch  calling up  when we were on up in  Boston.  Give me the archives.  I'll find it.  I know what he's talking about.  God, I love that one.  I'm not a prude.  I'm not a nerd.  And you know something? 
[02:28:00]  If you've got to say that,  you are.  Yeah.  Because she  abso-effing-lutely was.  Anthony, what's up?  You guys are dicks.  Why?  I don't understand.  I knew it was you.  I knew you guys  were making that noise  and I wanted to look  for my phone anyway.  I don't know  what you're talking about.  Yeah, I don't get it.  Oh, well.  All right.  You guys rock.  I think I might have  found it, Ant.  I'm not a nerd.  Try track 15 there.  Some woman.  And we get this all the time.  Just people that  don't appreciate the show 
[02:28:30]  but then feel driven  to call up our boss  and try to get us  thrown off the air  because they know  better than anyone else  to decide programming.  It's not.  If you enjoy this show,  you know something?  Someone knows better than you  and it should be removed  from the airwaves  because you're not capable  of making a decision  by yourself  and they know better.  And that's why  I'm shutting my mouth  from now on, Ant.  That's right.  If I don't listen,  I would never write a letter.  I'd have to write them  to myself all week long.  You know what it is? 
[02:29:00]  You stink.  You know what it is?  You don't like a show  or whatever.  Yeah, but we would do that.  Take the trial.  You just turn the goddamn thing off.  It's an appliance.  It's a radio.  It's an appliance.  You're not held captive  to your blender.  If your blender  doesn't make a daiquiri  the way you like it,  what do you do?  Punch your wife  and tell her to do it better.  Do it better, you bitch!  Held captive  by your appliance.  I am so angry  with this toaster  I'm going to write a letter.  So this lady 
[02:29:30]  got a hold of our bosses.  This goes way back.  A message from  2  February  10  at  6  57  PM.  Hello, Glenn.  I'm sorry to do this to you.  Please forward this  on to your general manager.  I'm wondering  if someone's going to wait  until someone goes in  and blows the head  off of those pigs  that work in your station.  They are disgusting pigs.  Their mothers must be  sluts and whores  in order for them  to go on the air 
[02:30:00]  and do the s***  that they do.  I am very sick  of not being able  to get in my car  and my oxygen  is the son of a bitch  in space  and fall into  your pig-sized  f***ing station  and I don't have to  hear a goddamn  16-year-old  get on with themselves  in goddamn stock rooms.  I have children  who I'm trying to raise.  Now, if you guys  don't stop it,  I'm going to turn  my f***ing life  into the cause  of busting your asses.  Now, please,  Glenn,  as you can see,  I'm upset.  I'm a professional person.  I've got children. 
[02:30:30]  I'm not a wimp.  I'm not a nerd.  And you can take  your right to speech  and shove it up their asses.  You won't stop it  because now  you've gotten me  very pissed.  Now, please,  forward the message.  Thank you.  Right to speech.  See, she's willing to  take your right to speech.  Take a constitutional right  and shove it.  Brilliant,  you stupid bitch.  She still annoys me  when I hear it  to this day  and I am so glad  we are back  on the air in Boston  because I'm sure  this woman,  this twat bitch C 
[02:31:00]  was jumping for joy  when we got booted  from up there.  Well, we're back  and I hope  you know this  and I hope  your kid  that you were raising  at the time  OD'd on heroin  while a gay man  was having backdoor sex  with him  and gave him AIDS.  Frank, what's going on?  You dirty rat bastards.  You had me looking  all over the car.  For what?  For my cell phone.  I'm going to kill you.  What do we have to do  with your cell phone?  We're doing a radio show. 
[02:31:30]  Oh, man.  We're not calling  anyone right now.  Yeah, I knew  it wasn't my phone vibrating.  I figure it's my buddy's phone.  He left it in the car  over the weekend.  What are you talking  about with your cell phone?  I don't know.  Nicky.  Hey, my phone  doesn't even ring like that  and I looked at it.  You guys suck.  What phone is it?  I don't know.  There's some phone thing  going on.  All right.  We found that the...  It's not a pay phone.  It's a portable phone.  Is that show  still on the air?  Probably not.  It is. 
[02:32:00]  Yeah, of course it is.  It's awful.  It's going to last.  It stunk.  It was great.  It would have been yanked off.  That 80s show?  Just garbage.  Speaking of shows,  the job is on Comedy Central.  If you want to get caught up  from the beginning,  they're doing that.  They're running it.  I guess it's 1130.  1130 on Comedy Central.  On Comedy Central.  Check it out.  My pal Adam.  My pal.  Hey, and I found the audio  of the hissing cockroaches.  Oh, listen to this.  This is what went in the barrel  of 55-gallon drums  with the girls in it  last time we did it.  Sick.  Something to look forward to.  We do the next 55-gallon drum challenge 
[02:32:30]  on Friday.  Listen to this, Patrice.  This is the sound  that these little cockroaches make.  What is that?  That's the noise.  That is something making noise.  That isn't somebody  doing that into a mic?  No.  Listen, listen, listen.  How many was it?  That was just one.  That was one.  We threw.  And you hear the girls  in the background  and they're in the barrels  going, what the hell's going on? 
[02:33:00]  That was like, oh, God.  Listen, listen, more.  Remember, girls, just yell.  Wait, I'm going to whisper  into the mic.  They're hissing,  hissing roaches.  They're huge,  like the ones you see  on Indiana Jones.  Oh, God, that's horrible.  I'm getting so excited.  It's horrible. 
[02:33:30]  Oh, my God.  I can't take it.  I give up.  Can you believe that, Patrice?  Is that great?  This is what we're going  to be doing Friday  for three and a half hours.  The R. Kelly video,  that sounded like.  Oh.  It hurts.  Another R. Kelly joke.  And we're up in the ante  this year with the,  you know,  this is going to just be  a little appetizer this year. 
[02:34:00]  And these girls qualify  to be in the 55-gallon drum challenge  this time around.  Determined.  The girl that drank the milk  is going to come back  and be in the drum?  Yeah.  Yep.  And we'll be dumping  stuff like that in the drum.  And the last girl in the drum  will win $2,000.  Separate drums, of course.  Mm-hmm.  Want to hear a little more of it?  Yeah.  Let me hear it.  It rubs the lotion.  It rubs the lotion on its skin  or else it gets the hose again. 
[02:34:30]  Oh, my God.  What is she doing?  She's hyperventilating.  Okay.  Anyone want out?  Wendy, do you wish to leave?  No.  Oh, my God.  No.  What's true?  Hey.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Wendy, how are you?  Huh?  Oh, she's horrified.  You all right?  I can't even talk right now.  Go to someone else.  All right.  Let's go to change.  I hope these girls know  what they're getting into on Friday.  Yeah. 
[02:35:00]  That doesn't faze you, Patrice.  You're used to growing up  with roaches, huh?  Oh, gee.  Oh, Voss.  Can you put, like, mice and stuff in there?  We got plans.  Don't you worry.  Oh, you got plans?  You surprised the people?  Yeah, of course it's all about the shock.  It's got to be a surprise.  It's all about the shock.  I think this year we're going to need  some medical people on hand.  Why?  You're putting Norton's blood in there?  Oh.  Jane?  And razor blades,  and then we tip it over and roll it.  All right.  Then we went to Jane with dancing cockroach. 
[02:35:30]  Jane's fine.  Well, see,  the merciful thing is  my goggles are so far.  I don't even know what that was.  Oh, good.  Okay.  And Tabitha.  And Tabitha.  I just want to know what that was.  Oh, my God.  That's even more horrible.  They don't even know what it is.  Hissing cockroach.  Please, don't tell us.  Yeah, I don't want to know anymore.  Don't tell us that we get out.  Please.  Really?  Really.  Like, don't tell us.  Okay. 
[02:36:00]  Don't tell them that they're...  Don't tell them.  I got to tell them.  I got to tell them.  You got to tell them.  Listen to the noise they make.  Go ahead.  Listen to the noise they make.  Rick didn't even want to touch it.  No.  All right.  I'm over here now.  I'm a hissing cockroach.  Thanks, guys.  And there you have a little taste.  Yeah. 
[02:36:30]  On the last time we did the 55-gallon drum challenge.  Aren't the screams great?  That was the showstopper last time.  And, you know, being it and I, we got up the ante and we have.  Yeah.  Now, did you throw more than one roach in?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  All sorts of bugs.  Oh, that guy hung up the phone that said they're taping a new show called That 30 Show and they said his boss is a part of it.  That 30 Show.  So don't forget, 55-gallon drum challenge Friday on the show. 
[02:37:00]  Paul, what's up?  Yo.  What's up, Paulie?  What's going on, man?  You guys got any updates on the Kevin Meaney situation, man?  What's going on?  It looks like Kevin Meaney doesn't want to talk about the incident that happened yesterday.  We're trying to get a hold of him and so far no phone call.  He's a crazy person.  I actually just got off the phone with his agent again.  He says he's been trying to reach him himself.  He's not getting any answers.  Oh, boy.  Uh-oh.  I hear some trouble going on there, man.  Kevin Meaney was found lifeless in his apartment. 
[02:37:30]  Now we're going to get a Chris Fawley update there, I guess.  You hear what happened there, boss?  Dude, try to get him on, man.  We're trying.  We're trying everything.  All right.  Cool job, man.  All right.  All right.  Kevin Meaney, sir?  Kevin Meaney at the airport.  I glimpsed away.  Yeah.  He was videotaping in the airport and he was like saying, you can't do that in this day  and age.  You know, security things going on.  You don't want to videotape.  And I guess there was kind of trouble.  He was kind of getting loud.  And one of the National Guardsmen come over with the M-16s all loaded. 
[02:38:00]  Meaney grabs the guy's M-16 with both hands and starts pushing him.  Is she out of his mind?  Yes, apparently.  She is out of his mind, I guess.  And then they wanted to pat-search his wife.  And his wife says, I got nothing to hide.  And shows her, opens up her shirt and shows her bra.  And Kevin Meaney just started getting loud and boisterous.  And like I said, grabbed the guy's rifle.  So they arrested him, took him to jail.  He's like a crazy.  We're going to lose the house.  Now we're going to lose the house. 
[02:38:30]  Then he did the we ought to worry.  I was going to say that.  I was going to say that.  I said that earlier.  You're like a crazy person.  I'm so glad I did it.  My Aunt Meg.  Look what you're doing to your father and I.  We're going to lose the house and you're going to put an eye out with that rifle.  Josh.  We are the world.  We are the truth.  Hey, Josh.  What's going on today?  Hello.  Hey, Josh.  Yeah.  He put the Willie Nelson bandana on.  Look.  He turned around.  He turned around. 
[02:39:00]  Look.  He put the Willie Nelson bandana on.  Go ahead, Josh.  Yeah.  Do you have the Miss Cleo clip?  The prank call?  Yeah.  It's hilarious.  All right.  We're doing a little potpourri thing here right now.  Sure.  Why not?  Thank you, bud.  Hey, Josh.  Are you?  You know what's hilarious?  Is that Malcolm X stamp thing?  The Malcolm X stamp?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, we can play that again.  Did you ever hear that one?  Yeah.  That's hilarious.  Well, here's the...  Oh, yeah, yeah, okay.  Here's the Miss Cleo prank.  Yeah.  Here's one of them. 
[02:39:30]  Hello?  Hello.  How are you today?  Fine.  Can I get your first name and your birth date, please?  No.  Who's calling?  I'm Cleo.  Can I please have your first name only and your birth date, please?  No.  I don't know who you are or why you're asking.  I'm Miss Cleo.  You're a Libra, aren't you, darling?  No.  Yeah.  I don't mean to sidetrack your question here, but who are all of these nosy people, outside  influences I'm seeing around you by the moon card? 
[02:40:00]  Who told you to call?  Cleo.  I know, but why are you calling me?  I want you to really remember the pill, all right?  Remember what?  I want you to really remember the pill, all right?  But isn't this costing a lot of money?  Yeah.  I'm seeing some forgetting, possibly.  And I'm seeing a new baby in the next three months.  You're way off track. 
[02:40:30]  Oh, my goodness.  Is there a gentleman in your life?  No.  Is he incarcerated?  No.  Did he used to play football when he was in high school?  No.  Yeah, that's the daddy.  You have a good life now.  You have the wrong person.  Pardon me?  You have the wrong person.  Well, I know this doesn't make sense, but you know that things always happen for a reason.  Don't you agree?  I know, but this costs a fortune, this phone call.  Who is paid for this? 
[02:41:00]  You're a Libra, aren't you, darling?  No.  Yep.  No, I'm not.  Yep.  Uh-uh.  Yep.  Nope.  Yep.  Nope.  Yep.  Nope.  Yeah.  I love you.  Oh.  And there you have it.  Miss Cleo.  I like the other one as well.  Want to play the other one?  That one with, hey, lady.  Yeah.  Where we got all the clips from. 
[02:41:30]  Why don't we play this one and we'll come back and we'll wrap up this mess and we'll play  What Do We Learn?  Very educational program today.  I know it.  You think?  Yeah, I think so.  A lot of things learned.  All right.  We'll find out next, but as we go to break, the other Miss Cleo prank we got.  Hello.  Hi, dear.  How are you?  I'm okay.  How are you doing?  Can I get your first name and your birth date, please?  Pardon me?  Good day to you, darling.  Can I please have your first name only and your birth date, please? 
[02:42:00]  Who are you calling from?  I'm Cleo.  You're who?  I'm Miss Cleo.  Uh-uh.  Cleo.  No, you can't have this.  Yep.  Cleo.  Yep.  Bye-bye.  Did you have a question?  Yeah.  Caller?  Yeah.  All right.  In what city are you calling me from?  I beg your pardon? 
[02:42:30]  All right.  In what city are you calling me from?  Who are you?  Who are you?  I ain't calling you, lady.  I'm Cleo.  Who are you?  Cleo.  Cleo who?  I'm Miss Cleo.  Huh?  All right.  Go ahead.  You Cleo who?  Well, you won't be asking me, darling.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Okay.  Yep.  Yeah.  Praise the Lord. 
[02:43:00]  Hello.  How are you today?  Why do you keep calling here?  All right.  In what city are you calling me from?  Call.  Come up on my telephone bill.  You're going to be in a bunch of trouble.  My son.  Don't do it.  All right.  It would be a bad move.  No more.  Hello?  You're a Libra, aren't you, darling?  Who?  Look.  What the hell is the different what I am? 
[02:43:30]  Don't call me with that, darling.  Because I don't...  I'm Cleo.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  You're a Libra, aren't you, darling?  Is this a brand of humor you can appreciate?  Let me adjust my tie and type this out.  Are you ribbing us? 
[02:44:00]  Oh, golly.  Good gravy.  Creepers, creepers.  Look at me.  It's outrageous.  Oh, my God.  Oh, brother.  Go f**k yourself.  Tasteless, offensive.  I need drugs.  You've got mail.  Sucks on a daily basis.  White pussy boy suburban humor.  You're listening to the Opie and Anthony show.  Aren't we supposed to be trying to gain listeners' guides?  No!  The Opie and Anthony show.  Is that a surprise to you?  N-E-W.  It's just about time to play. 
[02:44:30]  What did we learn on the Opie and Anthony show today?  Yes.  Don't forget Friday on the O&A show, the 55-gallon drum challenge.  We have all our qualifiers, and the big day is Friday.  $2,000 up for grabs.  To the lady that lasts the longest in her barrel.  A lot of people have questions, Opie, to a comment I made earlier in the show.  Oh, okay.  So I just want to give them an answer. 
[02:45:00]  Thank you.  A lot of people asking me to ring the bell if they are right, and you are indeed right.  All right.  Jerry from Medicine, I learned today we do our own thing now, like when men were dinosaurs.  When men were dinosaurs.  I hear me.  I hear me.  Also, filming in black and white hides fat cells.  It's not about what comes out of Monica's mouth.  It's about what went in it.  Right.  He also learned the crowd audio is on pot 11. 
[02:45:30]  He also learned that R. Kelly should have stopped at two.  Stopped at the second chick.  And Jerry learned Voss actually owns things older than his material.  Wish you could see tomorrow night at Wrestle's with me, Patrice,  and Norris, Rascals North and West Orange.  Oh.  Rascals North, Patrice O'Neal.  Very funny.  If you've never seen Patrice, he is a very funny man.  Norris is still doing the clubs, even with his lucrative frosted mini-wheat commercials?  Yeah. 
[02:46:00]  I don't want to pick up Norris.  I see all the new ones now.  Hold on.  There was something that just went on there that you didn't pick up on, Anthony.  What?  What?  You basically called him out and said he wasn't funny today on our show.  No, I just said he was on stage funny.  You basically said, believe it or not, he's a funny guy and come see him at Rascals.  Yeah.  Well, people were calling him a racist.  He's not a racist.  We just did a radio show where people could make that.  Oh, right.  He's a grown man, John Tuttle.  I'm just listening to this idiot.  He's the worst plugger.  He's the worst everything.  Isn't he horrible?  He really sucks.  But he goes, believe it or not.  He's plugging a show with no confidence. 
[02:46:30]  He's like, and then, because you know the second act is a crazy, dangerous Norris, dude.  Yeah, what's up?  The most dangerous hack I've ever met.  He's like a fourth degree judo expert.  I know.  And I can't say, Jeff, you stink with your tight dress coat.  If you want to put a stop to him, you just pour milk on him.  Oh, and your stupid hairdo.  I don't want him tossing me around.  He's a maniac.  I know.  He's a judo champ.  He's out of his mind.  Yeah, he'll kill you.  He's choking somebody with a tattoo on his arm.  That's what he has. 
[02:47:00]  He does have judo tattoos.  Oh, my God.  Once you make the commitment to get the tattoos, you better pretty much know how to kick some ass.  Tight khakis.  Voss has some tattoos.  Yeah, but mine aren't beating up people.  Oh, yeah.  He's a mini-week.  Yeah, he is a mini-week.  I see that there's like three different mini-week commercials now.  Voss's tattoos.  Do you ever see his tattoos of the Jewish star with Chinese letters next to it?  No, there's no Chinese letters next to it.  Norris?  Yeah.  I just want you to know that me, Opie, and my pal Anthony had nothing to do with the last two minutes of radio. 
[02:47:30]  Well, listen.  You going to give me two minutes or is that you going to interrupt me?  I didn't say anything bad about you, stupid.  Yes, you did.  You did, Voss.  You said, yes, you did.  Norris is the voice of a mini-week and also wants to kick your ass, Chris Voss.  I didn't say anything bad about Norris.  All right, am I going to have a chance here?  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  First of all, Patrice.  He said you're a fourth-degree open-miker.  Jeff, I'm joking, man.  Look, don't come pushing my nose in my brain. 
[02:48:00]  He called you the world's most dangerous hack.  Yeah, I heard rerun.  It was good.  You know, it don't matter.  Where are you at?  Toys R Us buying some new material?  No, I'm actually at the dentist asking what your bill is, you fucktooth.  We going to go again?  No, no, we're not.  All right, listen to me.  No, we're not.  Toys R Us for material.  He's a prop.  He's a prop.  I can, you know.  I just had to help the audience a lot.  I can't get into this crap.  No, go ahead.  No, go ahead.  No, it's ridiculous.  I do Ocean Township with him Friday night. 
[02:48:30]  We have a fight in the club.  I know.  He killed, though.  He almost killed me.  Yeah, I'm still going to kill.  And Patrice, I only met you twice.  I thought we were right.  You're going to mock on me.  I'm going to flip your bamboo ass.  Oh, and he will.  I met you more than twice, didn't I, Jeff?  No, I met you.  I met you.  No, no.  Wait a minute.  What about me?  Look, you're a little flustered.  I'm a little scared of Jeff.  You're a little scared of Jeff.  For the audience, I just want to let you know.  Patrice is funny.  I'll give him that.  Well, you guys are all working together. 
[02:49:00]  No, Patrice is very funny.  He is.  He's very funny.  Jeff.  Jeff.  For the audience listening, Jeff is dangerous.  Give us a little line from the latest Miniway commercial.  Are you serious?  Yeah, because our audience, these are national spots.  Everyone knows him, so I just want everybody to go, oh, that's the guy.  We're pretty proud of Jeff.  Yeah, every time I see it, I go, that's nervous.  Well, then how come Rick can't return a phone call?  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  I got to get everything out in 10 minutes here.  Oh, look at this.  Rick, stop flipping the bird to the phone. 
[02:49:30]  He can't see.  You don't want to piss off Kung Fu Carrot Top.  I don't know why Rick is...  Kung Fu Carrot Top.  Jeff, I am not laughing.  Ope is not laughing.  Hey, after Friday night, boss should be doing knock-knock jokes on the past train.  All right.  Kung Fu Carrot Top.  Because I blew him off the stage.  Oh, my God.  Anybody who was at the show in Ocean Township, phone in.  Jeff, you had a great show that Friday.  I'm not going to take it away from you, okay?  Oh, don't back out now.  You did.  Thank you.  Why don't you do a MiniWeed commercial in an Archie Bunker voice? 
[02:50:00]  Come on.  Come on.  Do a MiniWeed.  Don't have to escalate her.  You stink, all right?  Okay, Rick.  And you better have some food ready for me and Patrice tomorrow night when we get there.  Rich, if I stink...  No, I don't want to know.  See, the amazing thing is, you want to make fun of that MiniWeed commercial, I can now  buy a 2002 Mercedes, unlike your 72 Mercedes.  That's true.  I mean, maybe the 35 you owe me from the cell phone you ruined when you threw me in the  pool.  I paid you for that phone already.  You're right.  You're right.  I don't want to piss...  I'm not pissing him off.  He's dangerous.  He is.  He's out of...  No, I don't want to upset Rick either, but he should be turning a call. 
[02:50:30]  I wanted to come up there to beat boss on the air, but I don't want to just come  by, you know?  You know what it's like?  You ever been with a girl and you're done with her, Jeff?  Did he hang up on me?  No, I didn't hang up on you.  Jeff is really going to break your arms.  No, I'm not.  I'm not a violent guy.  He's not a violent guy.  He threw me off the chair.  He's going to kill you.  I'm trying to pursue a career, and if you say anything, I will kill you.  All right.  I like Jeff Norris.  Jeff Norris.  Yeah.  He is the frosted side of the MiniWeeds. 
[02:51:00]  How about it?  The Joe Pesci sounding voice.  Thank you, sir.  We want to hear a line from the commercial.  Okay.  I'm sweet and delicious, and boss is ugly and a Jew.  How's that for a MiniWeed?  I don't remember the fact that I was coming out of the video.  That's the unedited version.  That's on the South Park version.  Hey, listen, Jeff.  Thank you, boss.  Thank God.  Here's a little tip in the business.  You're in the wrong business to be trashing Jews, okay?  Listen to me.  I'm just helping you out.  Go after the colors.  Listen to me.  Jesus.  Colors.  Boss, I've got to hand it to you.  You've got some balls on you because Patrice is very big. 
[02:51:30]  Yeah, I know.  He's going to catch me?  Please.  I'll throw a hammer and go down.  I'll just stop and eat.  Jesus Christ.  Well, O-N-A, I want to come up and see you.  Tell Rick to return a call.  All right.  We'll take care of that, Jeff.  He's awful.  Come by and see.  Wait.  What happened?  What'd I miss?  Patrice is just staring at Rich because the joke was just awful.  Okay.  They're not all killers.  What did he say?  Something not funny.  Fat joke.  Nothing about a struggle or a try.  All right, Jeff. 
[02:52:00]  We'll see you soon, all right?  See you later.  Take care, Jeff.  I'm the rascals.  All right.  We'll do that.  You really don't want to piss him off.  Oh, no, no.  Yeah, that guy will F you off.  We almost...  I really pissed him.  We had an argument the other night, and we're friends and everything, and he got really  pissed off because he was drinking.  And you know, there's some people, if you have to fight, you'll fight them, right?  Yeah, no, you don't fight them.  You can't.  He ruined a vacation for me once because I went to Caroline's before I was going on vacation,  and he was showing me how he, like, killed someone the night before.  He goes, yeah, this guy was giving me crap.  I choked him out, and he had left him there on the sidewalk. 
[02:52:30]  So he goes, let me show you what I did.  I'm like, I'm not the guy you show it on because I'll break.  I'm like a goddamn graham cracker.  I'll just snap.  He puts his arm right by the elbow, the crook of the arm around my neck, and, like, squeezed  for a split second.  And, like, everything started turning black for that, a split second.  Then I'm on vacation.  I wake up, and I'm like, hey, what's...  Oh, my God, I can't talk.  I can't talk. 
[02:53:00]  He, like, did something to my voice box there.  He doesn't know his own strength.  And he gets excited when he's playing.  He's like Bam Bam.  He's so happy when he's playing.  He's dangerous.  He's just playing.  He goes, bam, bam, bam, and the house moves.  Hey, let me break your knee for fun.  Yippee!  Chris, what did you learn on the show today?  All right, today I learned Bill Clinton is well hung.  Yep.  Farts are only funny between three and seven.  And Voss's apartment can be seen on eatabullet.com.  Later, guys.  All right.  Thanks, pal. 
[02:53:30]  Let's go to cheesesteak boy.  Cheesesteak boy.  Hey, what's happening, fellas?  Hey, man.  What's up?  I learned that even white trash has better furniture than Voss.  He's just laughing at it.  White trash has better furniture than Voss.  Okay.  Norman rule.  Thank you, sir.  Norman.  He remembers that.  Crinkle, crinkle from the city.  I learned today Voss's furniture looks like it drifted ashore from the Titanic.  Today I learned, this is from Philly, I guess. 
[02:54:00]  Today I learned that fart sounds during Monica Lewinsky bits never funny.  Kevin from Cleveland.  I learned today that we should vote for Conor because he knows how to keep him quiet.  And Dave from Westchester learned that he has AOL in his car.  And the door fell.  All right.  We got to get these guys out of here.  So, what?  You guys are playing tomorrow night at...  Yeah.  Rassles North in...  Say it like you mean it, Rich.  We'll be at Rassles North in West Orange.  I'm not good at plugging.  Rassles North tomorrow.  Me, Norris, and Patrice. 
[02:54:30]  Tomorrow night.  I'm not good at it.  You can't be meek.  You got to jump in there.  It's April 18th.  Town Hall.  You haven't...  Oh, man.  Look at that.  Tomorrow night, man.  Wait, but Voss isn't playing Town Hall April 18th.  No.  Who's going to be there?  It's not even about me in there.  Who cares?  Tickets are available?  Yeah, Ticketmaster Black.  I'm sorry, Rich.  Go ahead.  No.  Go ahead.  You know what?  More people show up if you say you're Voss' friend.  Voss is a good friend of Norton's.  Please come see us.  Let's go to Mark.  Mark.  What did you learn today? 
[02:55:00]  Mark?  Yeah.  Whatever.  Hey, no matter what, you guys do funny.  One moron listener calls up every time and says how he almost crashed into a pole.  It makes me want to crash.  We try to blow off those calls now.  Oh, it's so bad.  All right.  You guys rock.  You guys do a better job with that.  I want the guys after they crash into a pole.  Norris.  Norris?  Yes.  Jeff Norris back.  I just, I would, I'm sorry for calling back.  I just would like to plug this with a little dignity so we don't have, like, retards show up. 
[02:55:30]  Hey, if you could snatch this joke out of my hand, you could have it.  Voss, all I have to do is buy a 1974 joke book.  Oh.  Ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen of the O&A audience, if you want to see two good comics, come and see me and Patrice.  I'm sorry, Voss will be there, but.  Hey, isn't Melissa there, too, I think?  What's that?  Is it Melissa?  I don't know if she's coming or not.  I don't know.  I think so.  I think she's coming.  Who's Melissa? 
[02:56:00]  Oh, my God.  What?  Raging Boulder.  The girl who works for your station.  She's both a beating.  Oh, she will be there?  All right, thank you.  All right, wax on, wax off.  Later.  All right, bye.  Oh, the hot Melissa from Philly?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  But she's not going to do comedy.  She's just going to stand around looking good.  Oh, did you tell the listeners I'm a big black dude, just in case?  Just in case they haven't figured that out yet.  Surprise.  I learned that Patrice doesn't have the tape.  Yeah.  Don't have it. 
[02:56:30]  Damn.  He doesn't have the tape.  I feel so good.  I feel like I've met everybody.  We still have fun.  Andy, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  I learned that when you cross a black person and a white person, you get a supermodel.  That's right.  We learned that today.  Very good.  Supermodel.  I think we have time for one more.  Jack, what's going on?  Jack.  Hello.  You're on the radio, man.  Yeah, I learned that, uh, we're on your side, Monica.  And we'll do anything to go to HBO.  He's quoting the tape, yes.  Very good.  Thank you, Jack.  No problem.  And with that, we'll see you guys tomorrow, all right?  All right. 
[02:57:00]  Don't forget, 55-gallon jump challenge goes down fire.  Yes.  On the O&A show.  It's going to be wild.  Oh, he's got you again.  You suck.  Oh, one more.  He'll get you every day. </pre>
