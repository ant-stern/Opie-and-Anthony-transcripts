<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with a comedic segment featuring Anthony's inept attempt at picking up litter.  This transitioned into a brief discussion of sports headlines, including the Yankees' losing streak, John Madden's retirement, and Kevin Garnett's injury. The show then pivoted to a more somber tone as Opie recounted his recent attendance at his grandmother's funeral and wake. He shared anecdotes about his grandmother's dementia, his interactions with other residents at the nursing home where she resided, and his observations on the overall atmosphere and morbid details of the funeral home and cemetery, including coffin arrangements and cemetery workers.  This led to a discussion and satirical commentary, laced with offensive language, on popular songs played at wakes, with the hosts playing snippets and mocking the selections.

Following this, the show hosted a lengthy interview with rapper Rick Ross.  The interview largely focused on Ross's ongoing feud with 50 Cent, with Ross delivering aggressive insults towards 50 Cent and his associates. Opie and Anthony punctuated the interview with their own offensive jokes and commentary.  The show concluded with a humorous mix-up where the hosts mistakenly identified Swedish TV personality Roland as Kevin Smith, another prospective guest.  Throughout the broadcast, several staff members were mentioned, including Troy (Eric's boyfriend), Danny (the photographer), and Sam.

[00:03:30]  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why?  Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screw!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony.  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:04:00]  Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  I've been dealing with a twisted testicle.  She wrote out a prescription that basically said, warm baths to let them float.  They would look like alligator eyes popping out of the water.  Notice the best show on TV.  I think it's called Three Sheets.  Where Anthony is in relation to the wind when he's driving.  I have a red light in my bathroom.  Wow.  We'll overshower with a chick.  We have a red light.  You're always thinking of how you can look a little better. 
[00:04:30]  Exactly.  So I have a blindfold.  I hand it.  Oh, she comes in.  The Opie and Anthony radio show.  The most popular show in the history of satellite radio.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  I miss.  You're three feet away.  I just, I suck at basketball or anything resembling it.  I understand.  Can someone pick that garbage up for Anthony?  No.  Come on, please, please.  No, no, no.  Please.  Oh, no.  No, no, no, no, no.  Wait a minute. 
[00:05:00]  It's Jimmy being exasperated in a rush guy.  It's an exasperated guy in a hurry.  It's an exasperated guy in a hurry.  It's his new character.  Yeah.  I like it.  That's a hit.  For like five minutes.  Then it's going to get really annoying.  Really quickly.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on, please, please.  Come on.  I like the please, please.  It's the most insincere please ever.  Oh, I'll get it.  Oh, the assist.  The slam dunk.  The Opie and Anthony show is ready to broadcast. 
[00:05:30]  Ready for action.  Yankees lost their home opener.  John Madden retired.  Yeah.  What else can we say so we can go home early?  Kevin Garnett is out most likely for the playoffs.  That doesn't look good for the Celtics.  And Linda McCartney died 11 years ago today at the age of 55.  Let's go home.  Start our weekend.  11 years.  11 years ago.  Wow.  Wow, wow, wow.  That's a long time ago. 
[00:06:00]  It sure is, Anthony.  It sure is.  Jiminy Cricket.  How was yesterday?  Oh, it was very funerally.  Yeah.  Man, it wasn't really that funerally, to tell you the truth.  Be honest with you.  Most people were kind of like, you know, relieved.  Well, for the people that don't know your grandma.  My grandma.  My grandma.  93?  93 years passed away the other day.  So we had the wake.  And the funeral.  And then the funeral. 
[00:06:30]  And Jesus.  It's like 93 years old.  I was even joking around once we got back to the house and saying, you know, just goes  to show, you know, we don't have much time on this earth here.  You know, you got to live for the moment.  It's 93 years.  The last four or five of those years, by the way, were the decline.  The George Steinbrenner years?  Yeah, yeah.  The Steinbrenner years.  The decline into dementia.  Right. 
[00:07:00]  So it was just kind of like, I have no recollection of my grandmother from about, I guess, three  years ago is like the last time I even saw her.  Wow.  And they had, you know, brought her for her 90th birthday or something.  Out of the home for the day?  Out of the home.  Over to my mom and Sal's house.  And, you know, she had a couple of things to say, but not really.  What were they?  Just kind of sitting around.  Blue.  Bubble gum.  One of the doughboys coming back from Europe. 
[00:07:30]  One of those, you know, moments.  That dementia is a bitch, huh?  Oh.  So, but.  Do you think it's a bitch for them, though?  I don't know.  For real?  I don't know, because when you have a lucid moment, do you think like, oh, my God, this  sucks.  Yeah.  I'm going to go back into, you know, flowers for Algernon in a second.  But then you do, and then you don't remember that you had that nice, lucid moment.  So, who knows?  And then, you know, she just had an old age.  She was never the help me.  The old age.  She wasn't the help me woman, was she? 
[00:08:00]  No, no, no, not at all.  Because when the famous accident occurred in my life, and my mom was in, like, a home for  a little while to recuperate, there were the help me women around the hallways.  Help me.  They'd sit outside.  Oh, no.  I laugh because I'm uncomfortable.  I just want people to understand that.  Sometimes I laugh because I really enjoy what I'm about to say, but in this case, I'm a  little uncomfortable.  But they're the ones that sit in their wheelchair.  They're older than dirt.  When you start asking how old some of these people are, you're amazed. 
[00:08:30]  Oh, she's 105.  She's 108.  What?  Yeah.  And anyways, she's sitting outside her room in her wheelchair, and you walk by because  you're going to see your, in my case, my mom.  And all of a sudden, they grab on with that hand, with that grip.  The claw.  The kung fu grip.  And they just start screaming, help me.  Help me.  And then, like, the people that work there are like, I don't pay attention to her.  And they almost slap her hand off you.  Help.  Right. 
[00:09:00]  Help.  Shut it.  And then you feel guilt, so you're like, you try to have a normal, you know, what can I  help you with?  Oh.  And it's just like, you know, it's dementia, and it's nonsense, and there's nothing you  could do.  There's nothing anyone can do.  I'll find my husband.  He's at the cemetery.  Right.  What do you, you know, that was one thing, because, like, my grandfather, he died, like,  I think we figured it out, like, 30 years ago.  Jeez.  Or something.  And she would kind of ask, you know, where's my husband? 
[00:09:30]  Where is Joe?  Where's my husband?  Mm-hmm.  Well, he's, you know.  He's long gone.  He's residing in the ditch that you're going to be next to in no time.  Let me teach you something about the next to you thing.  Oh, yeah.  It's on top of.  Oh, yeah.  Well, there are two ways to do it.  When you go to a cemetery, it looks all nice.  Oh, there's grandma and grandpa.  Yeah.  No, grandpa usually dies first, so he's below grandma. 
[00:10:00]  They stack them.  They stack those coffins.  Stack them up.  They stack the coffins.  Ah.  Yes.  That's fantastic.  My God.  But you guys had it more as a celebration of her life, right?  Exactly.  It was one of those things that wasn't any, you know, ah!  Oh, my God!  Was it your mom's mom?  None of that stuff.  Yeah.  Was she cool?  Oh, yeah.  She was cool.  The whole family was like that.  Just losing your mom or your dad's a little weird.  I would imagine, no matter how old you are.  And they were saying, you know, in a way, relief. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah.  Because all they were doing was, you know, making trips to the old folks' home and doing laundry and just, you know, doing things.  Yeah.  It's like a full-time job.  So that was that.  We then go back to the house for the let's-just-hang-out-because-somebody-died party.  And you don't want to be the first to leave that party.  No, no. 
[00:11:00]  All right.  Well, I got to go.  Yeah.  Well, look at the time.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because you got to figure out how much time.  Like, I think.  Here's the picture.  I think I could do three hours.  I Twittered the old Ginzo.  Oh, nice.  Look at that.  You got the wine.  I mean, yeah, that was a little early on.  And then more food comes out.  Very nice.  That was good, though.  It was a good excuse for a nooner.  I sent you a text.  I sent you a text.  What did I write?  I was trying to do a wise guy bit.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It's hard to do a wise guy bit through, you know, text messaging. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah.  Did you have any?  That's what I was getting at.  But I'm like, man, I don't know if he's going to understand that.  So then I had to write wise guy accent in parentheses.  Yeah.  You had a direction to your twin.  I'm trying to do an audio bit through a text, making up some whacked out Italian dish.  The church portion is the most, you know, ugh kind of thing.  So we go into the church, and then it's one of these, you know, big Catholic send-offs. 
[00:12:00]  So the priest is up there, and he's talking.  And I'm sitting next to my Uncle Joe, and we're just like.  A lot of Joes in your family.  A lot of Joes, yeah.  It's all Paulies and Peties.  And Antony's.  Joes and Antony's are our family.  And it was just like, we're talking, going, this is sci-fi fantasy.  This whole Jesus thing, where they're talking about how, you know, she is now with Jesus, 
[00:12:30]  who rose from the dead.  And I'm like, it's zombie Jesus.  It's zombie Jesus.  And he rose.  And then they tell other stories from the Bible.  And you're like, this is just some fantasy world stuff.  They had a whole discussion about that on yesterday's show with Bill Donahue.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  The storytelling, and there might be some problems, because what, the stories were handed down  for 60 years before they started actually writing the stories.  Yeah, how accurate.  It was the greatest game of telephone ever.  Oh. 
[00:13:00]  How accurate could you be 60 years later telling a story?  Then I guess there's supposed to be some divine, you know, intervention that makes it all  right, and makes it the way it really is, and the story is accurate.  But you're just like, what?  I'm listening, going, what?  Just stop.  Just stop.  Right now, Francis is with Jesus.  Jesus.  Jesus.  Jesus.  Jesus.  And, you know, he's taking the incense thing and swinging it around the coffin. 
[00:13:30]  There's smoke coming out.  You're like, what is that?  What is this, a magic trick?  What are you going to do?  It's the prestige.  Pull her out alive.  The prestige.  He was performing the prestige.  You can't do it.  He used a bloody double.  Yeah, they do all that, and then the drive to the cemetery, it's just the stress of keeping  in line and not losing the hearse. 
[00:14:00]  Oh, no kidding.  It's like, well, I'm going through red lights.  It's very stressful.  And for me, going through red lights, I was really going through red lights.  For real?  Well, did you have the cops and stuff?  You had a cop.  They usually give a cop or two for every funeral now.  The hearse had, like, the flashing lights on the front now.  Dude, one of my cousins almost got killed going to the cemetery for my grandma's funeral.  Almost got T-boned.  Because, just like you were saying, you're like, ah, the laws don't apply to me today. 
[00:14:30]  I got my high beams on.  Right.  And so you're going through the red lights.  Someone died.  I'm above the law.  So you're going through the red lights, right?  Yeah.  Most people would still look like, well, this is a little crazy.  It's the middle of the day.  I'm going through red lights.  And it's pretty busy where we live, right?  Man, my cousin was in front of me.  And obviously, like, just assuming everyone knows I'm just going through red lights, high beams.  And, man, he, by this much, by this much, getting T-boned.  Meaning another three days of walking around like zombies. 
[00:15:00]  Yeah, right?  It's just one of those situations where you just, oh, God, I don't want to deal with this.  And then the cemetery portion of it.  Oh, could you talk about that?  Because we talked about that yesterday.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Why?  Just your observations.  Well, it's.  You're good, like me, with this stuff.  It's so morbid.  Thank you.  It's just morbid.  Did you all get a flower?  Yes.  We got the flower.  But even though it's the morbidity started before that, they hold you up for a little while 
[00:15:30]  while I guess they prepare the grounds so it doesn't look like it's just a hole in the ground  that granny's getting dumped into.  Yeah, they try to.  They put the green astroturf over the dirt.  It's like a big pile of dirt.  But they put like this green astroturf over it.  You're like, you're not going to notice there's a big mound of dirt there that's going to be  shoveled in by the ghouls that work there in their utility uniforms.  Basically, they're getting window treatments for the whole.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And the ghouls are usually Mexicans.  We were discussing this yesterday. 
[00:16:00]  Yeah.  They're day laborers, it looks like.  Yes.  And then they put the wooden planks around it and cover that with the astroturf and tell  you to be careful when you throw the rose in because, boy, you sure don't want to fall  into the hole.  It can be embarrassing.  But the worst part was just off of a few tombstones down was some gentleman who had to be perhaps  in his 50s.  And he was kneeling down in front of this little headstone with mylar balloons that were in the ground. 
[00:16:30]  And he's just he's he's wiping things away and talking.  And I'm like, Jesus Christ, is this morbid that obviously there's some young dead person  that this maybe a father or something.  I don't know.  But I'm just watching this going.  Why?  Why am I?  Why am I putting myself through this depression?  Yeah.  Yeah.  See that?  It's not even the you know, wasn't even grandma going in.  That was fine.  Ninety three years old.  But then you just got to watch these people mourning. 
[00:17:00]  I don't want to say it.  But the best part about the cemetery was that my navigation system has every road in  Pine Lawn.  Really?  Yeah.  So I was able to get the F out of there because you could get lost in there driving around.  The roads are ridiculous.  And yeah.  Oh, I flipped that nav on and was just out of there.  Lickety split.  I'm out of here.  The second that rose was thrown down on that coffin, I was like, later, granny.  See you later.  Thanks.  Thanks for the good times. 
[00:17:30]  That's it.  Hey, it's weird that we were talking about this yesterday.  We're talking about it today.  The top five funeral songs.  We were just talking about this yesterday.  I heard a couple.  Because not only is it a really sad day for you and your family, right?  In most cases.  Yeah.  Then they have decided, well, now let's get those songs that really bring you down to a  sad place.  Why?  They want you to be sad. 
[00:18:00]  I don't know why.  Yesterday, someone called and they said, at the funeral they were at, I forgot for who,  whatever.  But the song was Everybody Hurts by R.E.M.  Like, why?  Everybody Hurts.  That's an awful one.  Like, you really need, you know, that much more emotion coming out of your sad body?  No, you don't.  Top five popular songs at Wakes.  I guess it would be Wakes officially, right?  Yeah. 
[00:18:30]  Eva.  Eva.  Eva Cassidy, right, was her name?  Over the Rainbow?  The famous Over the Rainbow?  Somewhere.  Are you kidding me?  Something tells me if somewhere over the rainbow is playing at a wake.  The guy in the coffin is very thin.  And there's a dog that needs to be adopted.  Yes, yes.  A dog needs a new home.  The rainbow is from the poodle he owned. 
[00:19:00]  Pissing.  Like, why?  Needs this.  How about we change it up, get some happy songs.  Play a xylophone solo on his ribs.  Number four.  Yeah.  Top five popular songs at a week.  Robbie Williams' Angels.  This must be a newer song, obviously.  Oh, yeah.  I don't know that one.  Oh, boy. 
[00:19:30]  Does an angel contemplate my fate?  Do they both the places where we go when we're gray and old?  Oh, my God.  Why?  This is crap.  Why don't I just play all the people who die, die, die?  All right.  Number three. 
[00:20:00]  We go to Sarah Brightman and Andrea Botticelli.  Or however the F you say his name or her name.  It's his name, right?  His?  Who knows?  Time to say goodbye.  It's this thing.  Oh, yeah.  It's the dude.  I'm so sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm so sorry.  Yes.  No, it was.  I'm so sorry for your loss.  Sorry for your loss. 
[00:20:30]  Here, take a prayer card.  App.  Didn't Swedish TV sensation Roland sing this for us?  Which song is this?  What is that, Italian?  Must be.  He didn't pay the fig. 
[00:21:00]  Why do I look like a schmuck on wheels?  He shoved him with a phone cord and his wig fell off.  I want to hear the dude.  Karen, we needed the money.  When the dude kicks in.  Listen to this guy's voice.  It's ridiculous.  He's good.  Enough with Sarah.  I like the girl.  Let's show up.  This is a good tune, though.  Yeah.  Are you going to download it on your iPod?  Actually, I will.  Yeah.  Not too, you know, tear jerking. 
[00:21:30]  This one I can handle at a week.  Really?  Oh, it's miserable.  This will make me cry at a birthday party.  Come on.  Just one part of the dude.  Then we can move on to number two.  It's not about you, Sarah.  Kick it in.  That bitch is a mic hog.  Isn't this the ugly duckling from England Idol? 
[00:22:00]  Old shovel face.  Oh, that broad's getting uglier by the day, too.  They couldn't get over how much she looked like me at the comedy show.  Oh, great.  Oh, here he is.  Yeah.  That's number three.  Time to say goodbye.  She really looks like she should have a hook in that mouth, just being pulled out with  pliers.  Yeah, but that's a picture of her gussied up for the TV show. 
[00:22:30]  You've got to see the ones where she's just hanging out at home.  That's the best she looks.  Spinster is the word.  Oh, they're calling her a spinster?  Yeah, the spinster.  We're talking about Britain's Got Talent and the ugly broad with the really good voice.  When you see the pictures of her just hanging out at home.  No, try it.  Put that picture of Eddie Izzard back.  The second most popular song played at Wakes. 
[00:23:00]  Second.  Coming in at number two.  Everyone knows this song.  Hit us.  Hit us.  Hit us.  Hit us.  Hit us.  Hit us.  Hit us.  Hit us.  Hit us.  Hit us.  Hit us.  Hit us.  Hit us.  Hit us.  Hit us.  Hit us.  Hit us.  Hit us.  Hit us.  Hit us.  Hit us.  Hit us.  Hit us.  Hit us.  This is a nice song, but basically Bette Midler's telling the person, look, we know 
[00:23:30]  you're a nobody, but I recognize you're something.  How was it in the fucking shadows, shit dick?  Did you ever know that you're my hero?  Everybody.  You guys should play this for Bob Eatman and then spray him with lamb's blood. 
[00:24:00]  We don't have to get to the part, do we?  Of course we do.  Of course we do.  We do.  Yeah.  Turn it up.  Come on, come on.  Please, please, please.  This would be so, like, horrible to hear it away.  Oh, yeah.  You're just trying to get people to cry.  Just let people's emotions be their emotions.  They don't have to pump up their emotions. 
[00:24:30]  Boo!  You know that parents probably play this one for, like, a dead kid, as depressing as that  is.  This is dead kid music.  You only know he wasn't your hero.  Oh, is it true?  This made Iraq cry when we found out Opie was his hero.  Oh, really?  Yeah, yeah.  Remember we played this?  Ew, did he?  We played this.  Remember he started crying?  Iraq actually sang this to his sandwich. 
[00:25:00]  He cried because I openly laughed at his hero list.  All right, that's enough.  You are the fat beneath my tits.  Where is Iraq?  Eating.  You are the gunk between my ears.  Fucking idiot.  Eat, rock.  What did he do to that?  Lived.  You missed the shirt he had on yesterday.  Oh, no.  Oh, his fucking, his substitute teacher shirt. 
[00:25:30]  What a fucking, what a nerd.  Is he trying to dress nice around here?  I don't know.  I think he's trying to spiff you up in case the bosses need him.  Yeah, the bosses see him.  It's a little weird.  Make some points.  A lot of people changing their look for the new joint.  She has fucking Elephant Man hair.  I know we've been teasing her, but she has fucking John Merritt hair.  Look at her.  She's singing into her hairbrush that she obviously has never used.  That should be a fucking, that should be like a Glock.  A shotgun.  Singing into a nine millimeter. 
[00:26:00]  That is a great picture to just Photoshop.  A cock, a dill.  Oh, there's so much that could go in that hand.  A shotgun, a barrel, a cock.  Yeah.  Not of the white variety.  It's, it's, uh, it's fucking ugly lady.  It's Dorothy Fatskull singing that fucking, uh.  Susan Boyle.  Susan Boyle.  She's got a red, uh, little sweater on and she's holding up a hairbrush like a microphone.  Yeah, that's a perfect Photoshop.  Her eyes are shut.  She's got the mic a good, uh, I don't know, eight inches away from her face. 
[00:26:30]  And she's holding it.  You could superimpose many things in that hand.  Oh, you gotta go with the cock.  Yeah.  You have to do the cockpit.  And she has hair like Mike Birbiglia.  It's horrendous.  Oh, look at the part of that fucking dill.  It's terrible.  Horrid.  Nice egghead.  Let's do the, uh, most popular.  Ah.  Trying to think of what this is.  Song at a week.  Amazing Grace?  Well, there's different categories. 
[00:27:00]  These are like the popular songs.  Oh, popular songs.  I mean, if you want to go with the popular songs.  Hymns.  Hymns.  And not.  Hymns.  Amazing Grace is number five.  So, yes, you're on to something there.  For hymns.  For hymns.  For the why hymns.  Number one hymn is,  The Lord is my shepherd.  Classical pieces.  Who cares?  Because we didn't finish the number one song.  We're not educated.  Yeah, here we go.  Number one popular song at Wakes.  Here we go.  Are you kidding? 
[00:27:30]  Are you kidding?  It's a good one.  The end is here, actually.  Yeah, it's not near.  Yeah.  Look at the body.  It's cold as my, my icebox.  God.  Why would you play a karaoke song favorite?  That's a Japanese guy standing on the cadaver.  Fucking up the L's.  Nothing worse than Japanese.  I've rived.  All right, that's four. 
[00:28:00]  I traveled each.  Lovely high rate.  My genitals are tiny.  They're dumping out on the hall.  Of course.  It's nice to be able to do an Asian accent before nine o'clock, huh?  I know.  Then again.  Oh, really? 
[00:28:30]  Give you the measure.  Right.  This show is on top of things this week.  The Fox affiliate's on car warranty scam.  We were just talking about this yesterday, too, Jimmy.  We could dump out of the Frank Sinatra, obviously,  because I started talking about something else.  They play that at Frank's, you think?  That's a good question.  I think that's played a lot of Itrallian ones, I bet you.  They probably played Elvis' version in Frank's.  Yeah.  Just to really stick it to him.  Where he's laughing or something.  That's the other one.  That's the other one. 
[00:29:00]  Have you guys listened to the Elvis channel on Sirius?  I have, yeah.  I was listening to it yesterday because I did a lot of driving.  I like it.  And they just got guys calling in about Elvis' stories all day long.  Really?  It's like, the guy's been gone for 30, 30 what, 30, how many?  77, 32 years.  I was going to say, 32, 33 years.  Wow.  And here's a guy, well, I remember, you know,  if you're lucky enough to be at the mansion,  sometimes Elvis would push the coffee table back and the couches back,  and he would give karate demonstrations.  Oh, that must have been, yeah, it was terrific. 
[00:29:30]  It was very special when he did that.  And his favorite movie was,  and if he didn't get up after the first showing of his favorite movie,  he would play it another five times.  Oof.  Just like, wow.  What was his favorite movie?  You know, it would have helped a bit, but I don't, um,  oh, man, help me out.  Oh.  You know a little something about everything.  And I heard it yesterday.  Somebody will get on this and feedback.  He loves watching it.  I was never a big Elvis fan.  Not only did he love watching it, 
[00:30:00]  he would just keep playing it over and over and over again.  That's what I learned from the Elvis channel yesterday.  Listen to me.  Lunatic.  Elvis was an ass.  But they're digging up anyone they could find  that might have had any type of, like, connection with Elvis.  Any story, right, right.  And a dumb little, like, oh, I met him once for five minutes.  Good enough.  Put him on the Elvis channel.  Whoop-de-doo.  I got an autograph back in Vegas.  All right, good.  You're going to call in at 7.  All right, hold on.  Hold on the line.  Right, right.  I got a call screener.  It's like, what do you got? 
[00:30:30]  Yes, Danny?  I have a list of some of Elvis's favorite movies.  Oh, yeah.  Let's see.  It says some of his favorites were Patton.  Nope.  The Dirty Harry movies.  Nope.  The Pink Panther series.  Nope.  Oh, wow.  Too bad he didn't live to see these new ones.  Ten Commandments.  He died when he was making one.  I'm paying attention.  That's the way it is.  Nice.  Rebel Without a Cause.  Nope.  French Connection.  Nope.  There was one that they said was his favorite movie. 
[00:31:00]  Are you running out of movies already?  Yeah, that's all this article had.  What side is that?  No idea about Elvis.com?  AllExperts.com.  Oh.  Not French Connection.  They don't know nothing.  Ah, you know what?  We'll get the answer a little later.  Whatever.  But it's just a weird channel.  I like the Elvis songs every once in a while, but.  Yeah.  There's a DJ and he just like has people calling in telling their Elvis stories.  I like the hip Vegas Elvis versions.  The old bloated?  Yeah, I don't like the. 
[00:31:30]  Not so much the old bloated.  Maybe his comeback.  69, 68, right?  Yeah, yeah.  I don't like the real early stuff.  That rockabilly crap or the gospel stuff or any of that.  But, you know.  You get a good Lord Almighty.  I feel my temperature rising.  His shit is good, man.  A hunk of hunk of burning.  I've never downloaded any Elvis music, but every time you hear one, you're like, you know  what?  This motherfucker had something going on.  There's a live Elvis from like his comeback.  It was from like 68 or 69. 
[00:32:00]  He had like, he did like, Dice is an Elvis.  He's the one that actually got me an Elvis.  And he hates Sweet Caroline.  I'm like, what's wrong with you, dude?  It's fucking phenomenal.  Oh, I'll just sing it.  Sure.  There's that.  He does Yesterday and Hey Jude.  He's got all these weird.  I live in all this cover shit.  Yeah.  What was the one about?  Inimitable style.  In the.  Oh, yeah.  In the ghetto.  In the ghetto.  In the ghetto.  Suspicious Minds is a great one.  Yeah, that is a good one.  I'll give you that.  No one has the favorite Elvis movie.  According to Elvis.  We'll have to find out.  Was it one of his or no?  It was a movie I'd never heard of, to be honest with you. 
[00:32:30]  Like, I mean, I would have remembered if it was French Connection or something like that.  What do you got, Iraq?  You got the answer or are you just bothering everybody?  Two girls, one cup.  Apparently, Troy out by our office is a huge Elvis fan.  Yeah.  Saying that it's Blazing Saddles.  Nope.  Not according to the Elvis channel yesterday.  It might be.  The guy that called in might have just made it up to be on the Elvis channel.  Yeah.  He sounded a little too young to be on the Elvis channel.  Blazing Saddles, really? 
[00:33:00]  That was, oh, crap.  This is going to drive me nuts.  Whatever.  Yeah.  By the way, it's just got to be said that Eric's new boyfriend is Troy.  Oh, really?  Eric's new boyfriend?  They are BFFs to the max.  Here comes Iraq.  Connected at the foreskin.  Yeah, Danny takes photos when he doesn't think we're not looking.  Which one is Troy?  I've known Troy for 13 years.  How do you know Troy?  Troy looks too young to know for 13 years.  I've known him since college and when I was living in Pennsylvania. 
[00:33:30]  Is he a fan of ours?  There's something weird going on at the end of the hall, by the way.  There's two guys.  Let me see.  What do those two guys do down there at the end of the hall?  Troy coordinates our channel, Bruce's channel, and a few other channels.  What do you mean coordinates?  I guess all the scheduling and the placement of...  Promos and all that crap.  And all that stuff on the serious side.  Right.  Okay.  And then there's another guy down there who does the exact same thing for Howard's channel. 
[00:34:00]  There's like...  These two guys are dueling it out who could play the show louder.  Yeah.  We walk down the hall.  Sometimes I hear our voices.  And then other days I hear Howard's voice.  And they're literally right next to each other.  And the guy next to him records Bubba's show in the morning.  Screw that hillbilly.  Are we allowed to say that now that we're in this building?  Who?  Thank you.  You saw the picture of the BFF, Ant?  Yes.  Ant?  The BFF picture is very funny.  You guys are just buddy-buddy. 
[00:34:30]  That's...  Where's Troy?  I'll get him.  Go get him.  He goes, I'll get him.  I'll get him.  I'll go get my boyfriend.  Yeah.  And introduce you.  It's just like if you ever need to know where Eric is, that's like the first...  That's so far what I've learned.  It's like if you need to find where Eric is, just look by Troy's area.  And chances are he's sitting on some filing cabinet just yucking it up.  They're yucking it up.  There is such funny little things going on that we find out later.  And that's one of them.  Like Danny's just snapping pictures of them together. 
[00:35:00]  Well, this is heaven for Eric.  You know that, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Because he's a big-time radio guy.  And he's one of the guys that is very excited to be here at SiriusXM.  He's in his element now.  But when we were all sequestered over at the other building and all alone,  he didn't get to mingle with all the radio people and tell all of his call letters.  The stories.  And by the way, you guys, before you mentioned Eric trying to like wear his shirt yesterday,  that button-down, I said the exact same thing.  I was talking to you to Sam or Travis, and I said, 
[00:35:30]  did you notice that he's trying to fit in here?  Because I noticed a lot of the other guys around here wear that kind of style,  where it's like that plaid button-down thing.  And I'm like, Eric is trying to fit in here 100%.  Eric can't fit anywhere.  He had a little button on his shirt today.  E-Rock's back.  Yeah, yeah, a couple of buttons, golf shirt.  You don't wear collar shirts.  I haven't worn them in a long time.  Why are you wearing them?  Because I think it was two or three years ago when you trashed me for wearing the same exact shirt,  so I figured enough time passed.  Apparently not.  Did I trash you with that shirt? 
[00:36:00]  Oh, yeah.  You told me I look like a picnic table one day.  Yeah, that's right.  Because Eric typically dresses like he's going to a Little League game.  No, it's great.  We trash these guys.  Then we go home and forget that we ever trashed them.  And E-Rock goes home and takes it seriously and changes his wardrobe over it.  What were you going to say?  So the collared shirt's not because it's time.  You want to impress some people around here.  No, that was actually a gift for my birthday from my chick.  That was the first time I actually wore it. 
[00:36:30]  All right.  What was the occasion, though?  Yeah.  Why'd you wear it?  Was it Troy's birthday?  Yeah, what did Troy get you for your birthday?  No, we did that Tuesday.  Troy's a big fan of the show?  Yeah.  Cool.  All right.  Eric and Troy sitting in a tree.  E-A-T.  We're still looking for Elvis's favorite movie, according to the Elvis channel, yesterday.  Yeah.  Everyone, Rebel Without a Cause, no. 
[00:37:00]  Across 110th Street, no.  That was a good movie with Harvey Keitel and Yafit Kodo.  Which one?  I don't know if Harvey Keitel was in that.  Yafit Kodo was in 100 Crush on his history.  I never saw that one either.  And Paul Benjamin, not Harvey Keitel.  Hey, Sam pretty much stayed up all night to get an interview with Rick Ross.  He did?  You want to go down that road real fast?  Yeah, he's the guy, if anyone doesn't know, that was him and 50 Cent were...  Bob Kelly turned me on to this.  When we had 50 Cent and we...  50 Cent was a great guest.  Great guest.  Yeah, he was.  He was very honest. 
[00:37:30]  Loved him.  He was like one of those guys who just will talk about anything.  He talked about, when we asked him about getting shot, he talked about his businesses, he talked  about music, anything you wanted to ask him about, he was pretty much an open book.  Yeah.  And him and Rick Ross are having this...  I didn't know who Rick Ross was.  I don't follow hip-hop.  But...  I do, Jim.  Just to ask me.  I do.  Yeah, but you live the life...  Well, you actually are closer to it than any of us with your fucking gun collection.  The hip-hop guys would love you.  No, not minor legal.  That's a good point.  But they would love you and you're...  You would probably have more in common with fucking hip-hop guys than any of us. 
[00:38:00]  That's true.  Other than my cock size.  Talk about gats.  I used to play a lot of basketball.  What about me, Jimmy?  That's true.  You probably would have a lot to talk about with most of the hip-hop fellers.  Yeah.  Sam?  So...  But we haven't really explained it, so there's a little...  Do they still call them beefs?  Yeah, you can call it beef.  Yeah.  Sam has full afro today.  Did you have that last night during the Rick Ross interview?  If you fucking puffed your afro out to avoid him punching you in the face...  Yeah.  Well, that's not why. 
[00:38:30]  Why'd you do it?  You're not wearing your silly afro ponytail today.  Because I took a shower and then like...  You haven't showered since you put in that ponytail?  No.  And then like ten minutes after I got out of the shower, Liam called me and said,  Hey...  It was like 6.30 at night and Liam was like,  Hey, you could do this interview now.  So I ran in without...  Because, you know, my hair was looking good.  Because the reason I pull it back is because a lot of times it's not looking that good.  How'd you get in?  In here?  My ID card?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I took the train back in.  At 6.30?  He got motivated for the show. 
[00:39:00]  What a guy.  It's Rick Ross.  So there's a beef between 50 Cent, Fitty, and Rick Ross.  Who's an old, what, prison guard?  Well, that's what?  50 Cent, yes.  Okay.  I was going to ask him about that, but he...  We still haven't really explained it.  Wanted to keep your jaw?  Some of the stuff 50 Cent did in this beef.  Well, Rick Ross or whatever, they...  I think Rick Ross, what I know, Rick Ross had shit-talked or bad-mouthed his music or something.  And then 50 Cent was...  Or he was mad that 50 Cent didn't talk to him in an award show or something. 
[00:39:30]  And then 50 Cent got very pissed off.  There was a diss.  Yes.  Jimmy, a diss.  The two gentlemen had a misunderstanding.  A diss.  And then 50 Cent responded to being bashed and he did a video and he said,  I'm going to ruin your fucking life.  And he was trying to basically kind of humiliate Rick Ross publicly.  Like, he took Rick Ross' ex-girlfriend, took her shopping, bought her fur coat.  His baby's mom.  His baby's right.  And he said that one of Rick Ross' ex-girlfriends is a hooker or something. 
[00:40:00]  Like, you know, he really...  Jeez.  He showed photos of him and said he's a correction officer.  And then I guess Rick Ross didn't go away.  He got, I guess, pretty pissed off.  Yeah.  And when I went in kind of expecting to bring that stuff up and get kind of shied away from it or whatever.  Like, I didn't think the interview was going to last long.  But, no, Rick Ross certainly came back at 50.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, really?  Is he a big guy?  Yeah.  He's bigger than 50.  Well, he's like, but he's heavier.  Like, he's not all muscle like 50.  Is he like over 300 pounds?  I think he's...  No, Danny's got a picture of him. 
[00:40:30]  I don't think he's...  Who do you think?  He looks like Suge Knight.  He looks exactly...  Yeah, he really looks like Suge.  Everyone knows what Suge Knight looks like.  He looks like his brother.  Who do you think would win in a fist cup?  You know what?  I was going to ask that, and I felt too five-year-old boyish.  Nah, that's all I'm thinking.  But that's what I'm wondering, too.  Who would beat up who?  I cannot get it out of my head, those two just going at it.  Well, I think 50 Cent has Hollywooded it up more than Rick Ross has.  Like, Rick Ross is still...  Rick Ross is very famous.  Keeping it real?  He's very famous, but only in the hip-hop community, whereas 50 Cent... 
[00:41:00]  Who's keeping it more real?  Are you trying to say Rick Ross works out in the basement and 50 Cent works out at, like,  the Reebok Club or something?  At a hotel lobby?  That's exactly what I'm trying to say, yes.  But I gotta say this about 50 Cent.  He's been shot...  Once you've been shot five times, including the mouth, how much can you Hollywood it up?  And he still fucking works out.  Guy's an animal.  Yeah.  Well, true.  Here's Sam doing What's the Haps with Rick Ross.  Yes.  All right, so we're here with Rick Ross. 
[00:41:30]  Rick Ross, what's the Haps?  You already know, I got the biggest album of the year dropping April 21st.  You know what I'm saying?  First and foremost, I want to thank everybody, and I want to commend you for your hot show.  You know what I mean?  To have him.  Thank you very much.  Your new album's coming out April 21st, but you've been in a lot of the hip-hop gossip,  you know, news for some time now, because 50 Cent has been saying some mean things about  you.  Why has he been saying these mean things?  Mean.  I don't think they mean.  I think he's a monkey, and he's confused, and his music is garbage, and I'm making hot music.  You know what I mean? 
[00:42:00]  I'm having fun right now.  Magnificent.  Top 10.  It's like number five with a bullet.  You know what I mean?  Close to, you know, it's looking like it's going to be a number one record.  So you think a lot of what 50 Cent's been doing is about jealousy?  No, I'm not going to say jealousy.  I think he has to try to do something to stay relevant.  I mean, it's like being Hulk Hogan right now.  You won a lot of cage matches, and now everything gone.  You got to lay down.  You know what I mean?  So he's Hulk Hogan, but you're John Cena.  Yeah.  That's what I get. 
[00:42:30]  That's a good wrestling reference.  Oh, great wrestling reference there, Sam.  He started the wrestling reference.  Yeah.  That's what he was talking about.  The king of the wrestling reference.  Yeah.  Can't see me.  Rick Ross's music, because, you know, everyone knows 50 Cent's sound.  Is Rick Ross good?  Yeah.  Rick Ross is pretty well respected in the hip-hop world.  Well, you want to hear a little Rick Ross?  Community, it's called.  Dude, I don't know any of his music.  The hip-hop community.  Is this the single that they're working right now?  All right, this is Rick Ross.  What's the name of the song?  I don't know.  What is it?  I think he said it in his little piece. 
[00:43:00]  Magnificent.  All right.  Oh.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Still one of the top funeral songs?  Still doing that?  Yeah.  Probably in some communities.  Yeah.  The coffin is shaking off the stand.  Big speakers in it.  Hit my casket.  I'm the magnificent with the sensational style. 
[00:43:30]  Far from being shallow, because she caught me with a smile.  Try to figure out my style.  Maybe that'll take a minute, but if all we got is time.  You can't be acting timid.  So we back to playing tennis, meaning going back and forth.  She's the one that I adore.  So I try to enter raw.  Conscience intervenes.  Concentrating on my cream.  I'm the king.  I'm so out of this.  What does that remind me of?  It sounds old school, right? 
[00:44:00]  Yeah.  Sounds, uh...  Come on, Sam.  You know this shit better than us.  It sounds like great for us.  I was going to say it sounds a little like Biggie with the beat, but I don't know Biggie well  enough to...  I've only heard a couple of the songs.  More champagne.  Oh, you know what this reminded me of?  But it could just be like the slight echo.  That song by Dr. Dre and Tupac. 
[00:44:30]  California Love?  California Love, yeah, but it was just the...  California!  That's just my white guy fucking...  Someone who knows rap would probably go, that sounds nothing like that.  Sure.  They love rap.  They love champagne.  It reminds me of the Eminem song.  What is that?  It's like an old grandmother.  You've got to put champagne in every song.  They love that bub.  They do love champagne.  Bub in the club.  The champagne, the hip-hop guys.  Bub in the club.  Rick Ross.  Sam asked Rick about the 50 Cent Rick Ross baby mama video, which hurt Rick's feelings, 
[00:45:00]  we learned, right?  Well, I asked him if it hurt his feelings.  You asked the tough questions.  Yes.  When he did that video on YouTube, was that really your baby's mom that he was buying  a coat for?  Oh, yes, it was.  Did that hurt your feelings?  Of course not.  It was the biggest form of flattery for a boss.  He should have bought our car.  Okay.  And finally, also, do you think he was just trying to be hurtful when he was saying things 
[00:45:30]  like that you can't fit in a European cut clothes and stuff like that?  I just feel that he doesn't buy any European cut clothes because we all know bosses get  tailor-made.  So, somebody do me the biggest favor and let the ugly guy with the fake teeth and the bad  skin know that.  Oh, shit.  Wow.  Oh, shit.  And the beauty is, too, that as long as I left a mic in front of his face, he would  just keep talking about 50 Cent and G-Unit and all their associates.  We really thought, we thought going into this that he was just going to blow the whole thing 
[00:46:00]  off.  Yeah.  I don't want to talk about that.  Here's my record.  I was hoping that.  I would ask him, like, goofy questions, like, did it hurt your feelings?  And he'd say, you know, I don't want to deal with you.  You're stupid.  The hurt your feelings part is very good because you get the question out and it's not so much  you just want to ask the question.  It's almost like you have to ask to ask him if it hurt his feelings.  So, you're not really asking the question.  That's secondary to, hey, are you okay?  You're such a fucking conniving asshole. 
[00:46:30]  Asking, why is he saying these mean things about you?  Yeah, yeah.  But you bring up the mean things.  Right.  Why?  You could have, like, if that was important to you, you could have just said, a lot of  mean things were said and we won't have to rehash them.  How did that make you feel?  No.  But you had to address each one.  Yes.  Yes.  Well, that way we know specifically if one of them hurt his feelings or of all of them.  Of course.  But apparently he doesn't have his feelings hurt too easily. 
[00:47:00]  No.  No.  Apparently not.  And finally, Rick spends about a minute insulting 50 Cent and G-Unit.  Yes.  We making hit records over here in the Ladies Lovers.  He fucked Vivica Fox and ended her career.  He's the only guy that makes Dr. Dre look like he should retire.  So, somebody call Chris Lighty, the monkey handler, and tell those monkeys, I'm the hottest dude  in the game.  Do me the biggest favor. 
[00:47:30]  Let those monkeys know I'm going to disrespect those monkeys until hell freezes over.  Do me the biggest favor.  Do me the biggest favor.  Phony Yayo has been smoking crack and snorting bad coke for so long.  He's confused.  They're all monkeys.  Well, Rick Ross, as far as primetime Sam Roberts goes, you're the boss.  Of course I am.  Somebody call Chris Lighty, the monkey handler.  Let those monkeys know that they're finished. 
[00:48:00]  And if he wants to make his mortgage, he may want to come work for me.  You know what?  I'm, I'm, I'm, wow.  How do I?  I'm never going to understand.  Why?  Because of the obvious thing.  Like, if a white dude said that on the radio, the firing would be instant.  Out of control.  Yeah.  And that's why, that's where some of this stuff is based on where you're like, well, if,  if other people are saying this, why can't we all say this?  Yeah.  Especially when he's just like repeating and emphasizing every song.  Right.  Monkeys. 
[00:48:30]  I know.  Who's the, Chris Lytle?  Is he, is he 50's manager?  Yeah, I think so.  I, I don't know exactly who he is, but he was, uh, talking about him a lot.  In the interview he did before me, he was also shouting it.  So I think he's like a, he's a, he's a units manager who's now attacking their manager,  not just them.  Hey, Sam, good job, man.  Yeah.  Do you think he has a gun?  Do you think he carries a gun, Rick Ross?  Uh, does he have guys with him?  Yeah, he has guys with him.  I don't think he carries a gun.  I don't think any of those guys are dumb enough to still do that, but I definitely think he's  got guys with him that carry guns. 
[00:49:00]  How many guys did he have with him?  Uh, when he left, he had one guy, his posse, Jimmy.  It's his posse.  Oh, his crew.  He rolled.  I like to say posse.  He was rolling about five deep.  Whoa!  Him plus five guys?  Yeah.  And it was just like...  Rolling about five deep.  Listen to you.  Were they smiling and looking like they were having fun, or were they kind of serious guys?  No, they were not.  They were like...  They were only having fun when he was having fun.  If he was smiling and laughing, they were smiling and laughing with him.  But when he was in the other room...  Yes, man.  ...they weren't smiling and laughing with us. 
[00:49:30]  They were looking around the room.  You know what I mean?  But did they look like they were ready for a problem?  Oh, yeah.  Yes, absolutely.  There was one guy from Def Jam who was obviously there, you know, with the label.  He was cool and everything.  And then there were four guys who were just there.  Were they big fellas?  They were.  And Rick Ross is a giant.  Were you scared?  I'm never scared.  For real.  Oh, man.  Step out of character for a second.  I don't know.  Sometimes I don't know who we're talking about.  I know.  What character is it?  Good point.  Asshole Sam.  Were you scared?  No, I wasn't scared because he never took offense to the line of questioning. 
[00:50:00]  But were you scared asking the question, not knowing how he was going to answer?  No, because I knew...  Because we get in those positions sometimes on our show, like, all right, we know we have  to ask this question.  We don't know how he's going to handle this, but all right, here goes nothing.  I would have...  Because the first question wasn't that bad.  It was just saying, why is he saying these mean things?  I was going to ask the follow-up questions regardless, so I would have been scared asking  those follow-up questions had he not been so responsive to the first one.  But I wasn't scared asking the first question.  Yeah, I mean, because it's not like you were siding with anybody. 
[00:50:30]  It's not like you were saying, hey, you sucked.  You know, then you get a problem.  But you just asked...  You looked innocent enough to pull off.  Were you sad or did he hurt your feelings?  That's my strength.  Yeah.  That is your strength.  Your strength isn't...  Stuff it.  Yeah.  Like, you look like fucking a skinny Shirley Temple.  Who's going to punch him?  He waddles in like a penguin, so people are like, oh, all right.  He's got fucking malformed feet.  Big-ass afros.  Yeah.  They give you a little slack because they see you coming.  Yeah, I mean, innocent little boy. 
[00:51:00]  Who's this pathetic kid that doesn't like eating meat?  Yeah.  And they can't tell if my questions are smart-ass questions or naive questions.  Right, right.  You just sound like a naive little kid.  Right.  Meanwhile, you are a complete smart-ass.  Well, that's up for judgment.  Yes, of course it is.  Thank you, Sam.  You're welcome.  If you see a hockey jersey way down the hall, that means Kevin Smith is here.  That wasn't Kevin Smith?  Roland has arrived, and he as well is wearing a hockey jersey. 
[00:51:30]  Roland, we better get in here.  Dude, I thought that was Kevin Smith.  I even had you run out of the studio to kind of hold him back because I know we want to  take a break before the big Kevin Smith entrance.  That is Roland.  That's Roland?  Yeah.  Wow, this hallway is really long.  The Swedish TV sensation is here?  Has arrived.  Stop talking about the hallway.  With his brother.  With his brother?  With his brother.  Can we?  Have you guys ever met Roland's brother?  I saw Ricky Gervais with him.  Yeah, I like his brother a lot.  Yeah.  When can we say hi to them?  We have to fucking...  Should we say hi to them on the air and then go... 
[00:52:00]  No, let's take a quick break.  Okay.  We can come back fast, though.  Opie and Anthony, stay there. </pre>
