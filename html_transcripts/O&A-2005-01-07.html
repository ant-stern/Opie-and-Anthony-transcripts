<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show, broadcast live from Las Vegas during CES, was a raucous affair featuring Opie, Anthony, Jimmy Norton, Steve, Laszlo (a tech expert from GTA), and Frenchie (a chef).  The show opened with Opie's characteristic vulgar and sexually suggestive commentary about women.  Jimmy Norton's debilitating illness, resulting from a previous night's BLT and creamy soup binge, dominated much of the early broadcast, with frequent updates on his vomiting and the need for a dedicated "vomit room."  He recounted explicit details of his experiences at a porn convention, including descriptions of adult film stars and encounters.

Steve described their own experiences interviewing porn stars at the AVN convention, highlighting the offensive nature of some of their questions (including those about scat) and their near-expulsion from the Vivid booth.  Club Soda Kenny's role in these interviews was mentioned.  A highly offensive and profane audio clip of baseball manager Earl Weaver was played.

The conversation then shifted to CES, with Laszlo commenting on the showcased technology.  The hosts shared their experiences at various booths, including those featuring technologically advanced cars and a karaoke section predominantly populated by Asian people. Opie recounted a lengthy and difficult encounter with a fan.  They discussed their agent, Bob, and their attempts to evade him, and mentioned a bizarre lawsuit against *Fear Factor* concerning viewers vomiting after watching a rat-eating segment.  This led to a discussion of their own previous rat-eating segment featuring Frenchie.  Frenchie later called into the show.

The show also covered various technological advancements at CES, including home automation systems with child tracking and a dog bowl that alerts owners when the water is low. Laszlo recounted his experiences, focusing on absurd home automation products like a wave runner with a built-in TV. The strict dress code at the Venetian casino was also discussed.  Callers Henri and Dan contributed to the conversation, with Henri mocking Frenchie's previous call and Dan criticizing another XM radio show, sparking further discussions about sexual topics and unusual sexual practices.

Jimmy Norton shared his disappointing Las Vegas experiences, including a bad dinner and a friend who stood him up.  The presence of Playboy Playmates and the anticipated arrival of George Wallace were noted; Penn Gillette's absence was attributed to illness. The Michael Jackson story transitioned into an explicit discussion about the adult film industry involving Playboy Playmates, detailed descriptions of sexual acts, fetishes, and pornographic films.  This included a discussion about a listener who uses a Sawzall with a dildo attached for sexual activity and the hosts' past controversial stunts.

George Wallace joined the show, boasting about his family's Super Bowl rings and shifting the conversation to the lurid details of the Michael Jackson allegations reported in the New York Post.  Wallace shared humorous observations about New York City landmarks, his experiences performing for various audiences (including Laura Bush and Black Republicans), and the firing of radio personality Frankie Blue.  He discussed his Las Vegas residency, his aversion to gambling, and his comedic routine, criticizing the cost of re-inauguration, commenting on Tiger Woods and Vijay Singh's racial appearance, and joking about Latrell Sprewell's financial woes.  The conversation covered Las Vegas dining, their diets, and a bizarre encounter Wallace had with a woman who claimed he was a German Shepherd in a past life.  The discussion returned to the Michael Jackson allegations, delving into graphic details from The Smoking Gun website, and expanding into topics such as the "Half Mile High Club," Kobe Bryant's rumored hotel room service issues, and the use of lubricants.  A voicemail from Jimmy Norton's mother reacting to his on-air discussions of prostitutes was played. The show concluded with promotional announcements for XM Radio and the upcoming porn convention.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Schoolhouse used to be.  So I tell you, when Mona died last winter, I said to myself,  Alan, you keep busting your hump 16, 20 hours a day, you'll end up with a 60 million dollar funeral, you know?  Hey, doll, can you scare up another round for our table over here and tell the cook this is low-grade dog food, all right? 
[00:00:30]  Now here, take this for yourself, okay?  Gee, I had better food at the ball game, you know?  I tell you, this steak still has marks where the jockey was hitting.  Well, anyway, today I just stick to real estate, you know?  With the market these days, if you own anything but land, you own a popcorn fire.  Oh, somebody stepping a duck?  Isn't that right, sir? 
[00:01:00]  The graveyard is two blocks to the left, okay?  Dog food!  I'm sure he is dog food!  Let's go!  Hey, where's the ball?  Let's have some drinks here, see what's going on for crying out loud.  Hey, wait a minute, this is for you, all right?  Oh, Captain Hook!  How about the granule, huh?  Ah, forget about it, I'm just kidding, all right?  Oh, this is your wife, huh?  Oh, a lovely lady, hey, baby, you're all right.  You must have been something before electricity, huh? 
[00:01:30]  Okay, okay.  Hey, doll, how are you, huh?  You live alone?  Hey, rabbi, nice to see you.  Okay, you're all right.  Folks, how are you, huh?  Oh, this is your grandson, huh?  Oh, a wonderful boy, nice boy.  Oh, that is a good boy, okay?  Now I know why tigers eat their young, you know?  It's everything 24-7.  XM-202.

It's the Opie and Anthony Show, live from Las Vegas. 
[00:06:00]  I don't mess with underage girls.  What the hell is going on out there?  We're the only radio show that makes you want to hate us.  Good piece of input, stupid.  Shut up.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Here it comes, kids.  Hold on to your hats.  Is that so?  Who made you poop in this dumpster?  Oh, it works today.  Ah, ah, oh, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.  I hope you like to go by a lot. 
[00:06:30]  Huh?  Ah.  Very good.  It's the ONA Virus, live from Las Vegas.  How are you guys?  Huh?  Oh.  We got a live audience, Anthony.  We hate live audiences, but enjoy the show.  We're just not used to a live audience.  It's usually the wee hours of the morning.  In that New York crap hole.  that we're in on a daily basis, so it's just a little different.  I think being in this atmosphere, you kind of want to go out and party and have some fun 
[00:07:00]  instead of doing the show.  When we're in New York, it's nice to think that no one's actually listening to our crap.  Yeah, you just kind of do it.  You're like, ah, no one heard that.  But yeah, we're in Las Vegas, and it's raining.  I think it rains once a year, and it figures the weekend we're in Las Vegas, it's going to rain on us.  But you don't really do many things outside, so it doesn't matter.  What are you going to do?  Although, Opie might go rollerblading down the strip or something. 
[00:07:30]  But most people just hang out in their respective casinos and gamble.  Or they come into convention centers and see the latest technology or smut, in Jim's case.  We're at the CES. We're going to have Laszlo from GTA.  Yes.  He's actually like a tech head.  Of course he is.  And he can make sense of all this crap that we've been walking around and checking out.  That's what his show is.  It's all full of new technology.  What does he do?  The technophile for XM?  Technophile. 
[00:08:00]  It's great.  There he is.  In a few minutes.  But first, we've got to talk about Jimmy Norton.  Little Jimmy Norton almost didn't make the show today, Anthony.  He wasn't feeling well.  Did you have a boo-boo in your tummy?  Yeah.  I'm sick.  And not just because I have an erection reading this Michael Jackson story.  I am not.  We'll get into the Michael Jackson thing.  Front page of the post today.  Very unhealthy.  Yeah.  I've been vomiting all morning.  Now, why do you think?  You would know yourself better than anyone else.  Why do you think you were vomiting? 
[00:08:30]  Ugh.  I was nude, and I walked by a mirror and caught a glimpse.  I think it's just because I think I ate bad yesterday, and I just put bacon on it.  Wait, you ate bad yesterday, and you think?  You think you ate bad yesterday?  Three BLTs in 24 hours.  Yeah.  Yeah, that could be the problem.  And these are like Las Vegas BLTs.  I mean, the bacon is like an inch thick.  It's greasier than usual.  Not much LT.  Oh, the bread is just soaked with the bacon grease, and he's wondering why he's getting sick.  But then you had that soup.  Yeah.  Which I told you not to get.  Creamy tomato soup, and I had a creamy asparagus soup earlier at another dinner. 
[00:09:00]  And I can only imagine Jimmy thinking, hey, it's tomato.  It's got to be healthy.  It's good for me.  It's made with a tomato.  Yeah.  How bad can tomato be?  But it's a cream soup.  Yeah.  There was so much cream in it.  It had like a light brown texture to it.  I'm looking at it going, that doesn't look like tomato soup.  Was it a thick, creamy batch of soup, Jim?  Yeah.  Very viscous-y.  Very hearty.  And I woke up, and I just had to throw up.  Filled to the brim, right up to the tippity top.  Yeah.  It's like, whoa, thick.  It's like, whoa, don't spill any as you bring it to the table.  Well, the waitress is bringing it over. 
[00:09:30]  Ooh, don't spill a drop.  I want to eat every little bit of it.  Every heaping spoonful.  With cornbread.  I don't even like cornbread.  Oh.  Did it have a pudding skin on it when it came over that you had to peel off?  All creamy, disgusting.  So no wonder you got sick.  And you just started puking when you got back to your room?  No.  I woke up this morning.  I knew I had to throw up, so I ran into the bathroom.  And it just tasted like those potato skins with bacon on them.  It just tasted like bacon and cheese.  I really threw up.  Did you have that too?  Potato skins with bacon?  No, but that's just what it reminded me of coming back up. 
[00:10:00]  Oh, I was going to say.  Club Soda Kenny had to call all of us to say, little Jimmy Norton is not feeling well.  He's going to try to make the show, guys.  And then he's like, you told him it was the BLT and the tomato soup.  And then he goes, I think it might have had something to do with the ladies he's bringing  up to his room.  Yeah.  Now, if you're ingesting certain products that a human being is supposed to get rid of...  It couldn't be healthy.  Yeah.  Maybe that's part of the reason you're feeling a little sickly. 
[00:10:30]  No, last time I was actually pretty normal.  I didn't do anything disgusting last night.  I doubt that.  You mean relatively speaking?  Yeah, compared to what I usually do.  Yeah, last night was fairly normal.  I spent yesterday at the porn convention and, you know, I ate bad and that's what happened.  That's why I'm sick.  So I have to run off the stage.  That's why.  I actually made Ben put a bucket.  Can you imagine the lady?  I see there's like a little, there's a bucket there.  Oh, no.  He's got a whole thing.  He goes to Ben.  Ben, one of these rooms where they're doing these, you know, huge meetings, you got to  set it aside in case I got to run off the stage.  We have a vomit room just for Jimmy. 
[00:11:00]  Oh, yeah.  We have a vomit room for Jimmy today.  Like a Roman emperor.  Or how great would it be to vomit in front of those hot Playboy chicks?  Hi, can I have your number?  No.  Speaking of the porn convention, we're at dinner and, of course, he has to get all the digital  pictures of everybody, you know, the celebrities.  He's showing me these pictures of, I guess, old porn stars, right?  Yeah, a couple.  I didn't recognize any of them except for Amber.  Amber Lynn, yeah.  Amber Lynn, I recognize.  She looks really good.  Does she still look good?  Yes.  Really?  Yes.  Yeah, she looks great.  She's been in the business for a while and that's a business that kind of chews you up 
[00:11:30]  and spits me out.  Yeah, 20 years.  But Jimmy said that, what, she's like 53 now or something?  She's got to be close to 50.  If I said that, she'd probably smack me in the face.  And she still does movies or not?  No, unfortunately.  She should do movies.  She's really hot.  No one wants to see that.  I do.  We're at the table as he's eating his awful tomato soup and his greasy BLT.  I can still taste it when I burp.  Bubbling.  Our goal is to make you puke in front of everybody here.  So he's showing me the pictures off his camera and I don't know any of these guys and he's 
[00:12:00]  all excited like, no, that's Buttman.  You don't understand.  Oh, like he was taking pictures at the Oscars.  Yeah, he revolutionized the whole porn industry.  Why did Buttman revolutionize the whole porn industry?  Because he followed, he did all that point of view stuff where he was following girls up  steps, acting like he just met them in public as opposed to like the stuff that was shot  on film and then all the...  Almost like reality TV porno.  That's all him.  And he was Buttman.  Absolutely.  Interesting.  And that made watching porn better?  Oh my God, much hotter.  I was so stupid. 
[00:12:30]  I used to whack my bag and go, oh my God, I just met these girls.  Not really that they had to sign releases and all that stuff.  I actually thought it was real.  Oh, so we'd walk up to him and go, hey, hey baby.  You see the hand come out from the point of view.  You just see the arm come out from front of the camera because he was holding the camera.  You're so gullible.  Later in the movie, it's not an arm.  The acting in those films, you're so gullible.  You really thought that was going down?  Yeah, because he would follow them down up the steps.  Yeah, it looked kind of realistic.  All right.  Yeah.  Well, where's Steve?  Steve was at the porn convention with Jimmy Norton and Club Soda Kenny, and I guess Kenny 
[00:13:00]  just almost got kicked out of his second convention.  Something we'll get into when we get back to New York, I guess.  But you guys were doing all sorts of interviews?  Yeah, we hit the AVN convention.  I think Steve's mic's a little hot.  No, not loud.  Your hat was hitting it, and it made your mic a little hot.  It's just flaming.  It never goes away.  No, it never goes away.  Yeah, we hit the AVN convention at the Stands Convention Center yesterday.  There you go, Steve. 
[00:13:30]  Sorry, Steve.  It's okay.  And we just basically went booth to booth interviewing as many of these porn chicks as possible.  And at first, I started to do it.  I talked to John Doe, a porn director.  John Doe?  Yeah, exactly.  And we were talking about exactly what Jimmy was just talking about, those reality point-of-view  pornos where the guy, he holds the camera himself while he's in the act, so the people that buy 
[00:14:00]  it think they're in the midst of the whole thing.  Doesn't anyone make a good Dirk Diggler action movie type porno anymore?  They do, actually.  There's a whole...  There's companies that do...  He knows it all.  Of course he does.  It's great.  There's companies that now shoot exclusively on film with high-profile stars.  The acting sucks.  But, yeah, but this genre that he's doing, it's all very, very raunchy.  It's two people in a room.  Supposedly, it's a lot hotter.  And we're talking to him.  And I did it very straight up.  And I'm like, eh, why don't we get Kenny to do this?  So we wrote down a whole bunch of questions for this big, lumbering doofus to go around 
[00:14:30]  and ask these girls.  And Kenny just was...  He was fantastic.  We were just going around to different booths, grabbing...  Not grabbing, but...  That would have been bad.  Getting the attention of all these girls.  And Kenny would just go off.  What were some of the questions?  Did you make a reservation for the tsunami?  I heard one girl had no clue.  Yeah, that was actually...  I mean, how are you on Earth? 
[00:15:00]  On the planet Earth.  And you have no clue about the tsunami.  You're a porno girl, I guess.  Well, there's actually...  I've got to jump in.  There's actually a restaurant in the Venetian called Tsunami.  Which I thought was hilarious.  Yeah, you asked for a drink.  They splashed in your face.  But yeah, it's a Japanese place.  Yeah, she had no clue what a tsunami was.  No clue what a tsunami was.  He asked the girls who they wanted to win the presidential election.  And they had no idea.  They were just throwing you.  Oh, I don't know the name. 
[00:15:30]  What was the question where he almost got kicked out of that convention?  We have all the audio that will play Monday when we get back to New York.  We did 19 interviews yesterday.  One person got really pissy with him.  And it was someone at the Vivid booth.  Got really angry with Kenny when he was asking about fetishes.  And we were trying to work Jimmy into the discussion about his little golden shower fetish.  Yeah.  And the subject sort of migrated to fecal matter.  Scat.  Yeah.  As they call it.  It's called scat in the business.  And all of a sudden.  Scat, O.P. 
[00:16:00]  Scat.  We get this one girl gives us the most mortified look and says, I don't like these questions.  Calls over her manager, Howard, get them out of here.  You're a porn actress.  Yeah, exactly.  Thank you.  Like, what the hell is the...  You're promoting your latest anal feature.  And I'm a dirtbag?  Well, yeah.  You guys said it was something else.  And she was trying to explain that it's called golden showers.  Oh, well, that was another one.  Oh, that was another one.  That was another one.  European, right?  Yeah.  Is that the scat? 
[00:16:30]  Kenny was asking about urination fetishes.  Look at Jimmy's all angry with me because I don't know the lingo.  What's European, Jimmy?  European?  It was a play on words.  It was a play on words.  Oh, European.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, stop.  You just caught that, you dumbbell?  That's so corny.  Steve didn't even get it.  Well, look at him.  What?  Nothing.  So we got the audio for Monday.  Yeah, yeah.  It's really fantastic.  Steve, before you go, you got to check out Jim Norton's arm hair.  Yeah.  He was letting us all touch his... 
[00:17:00]  Very exciting.  No, he was letting us all touch his arm hair last night at dinner.  That's funny.  I guess he's ticklish.  All right.  Well, anyway, thank you, Steve.  Yeah, no problem.  More from Steve later on.  Oh, he's so excited about the...  Steve.  Well, tomorrow is cool.  We're going to be broadcasting live from the AVN.  Yeah.  And it's going to be a whole different radio show.  Oh, please.  Some of the guests we're going to get there?  Because we're on our best behavior.  I mean, Hugh Pinero and everybody sat us down. 
[00:17:30]  Elo, Straylo.  Now I know Hugh Pinero.  His nickname is Hugo.  It's got to all end with the O thing?  Yeah, Hugo.  Hugo, Straylo, Elo.  They kind of want us to do like a...  Kind of a PG radio show while we're at the CES.  Not so much for what's going out over the air, but just for the live audience.  We're doing a big commercial for a lot of these goofballs that are checking us out.  The geeks.  Showing that we can behave.  So then they can go out and sell the show and sell XM Satellite Radio and all that. 
[00:18:00]  But it's not an honest representation of the program.  Oh, no.  No.  I think tomorrow will be a little more honest.  The past day and today is what's called a lie.  A big lie.  This is not the program that the Opie and Anthony show does.  This is us sitting around doing an XM commercial.  Yeah, we're just kind of showcasing ourselves, right?  They get all nervous when we start talking about Jimmy's exploits and the adult video thing that's going on. 
[00:18:30]  And they get a little, oh, what if someone's out there and they see and they get upset?  They haven't heard us curse or anything, you know?  A couple of curses.  Yeah, like the S word.  But, you know, they don't want the F-bomb being dropped or...  It's ridiculous.  You know who I ran into last night?  I was going to get some Starbucks and, of course, Ben's at the bar just slamming down pints.  Look at him.  No, I wasn't.  Because he's sick.  Well, he was on, like, extra strength cold medicine and drinking beer at the same time.  Yeah, when you're taking that extra strength cold medicine, you want to sit at a bar and really wash it down. 
[00:19:00]  Well, he's not Ben, by the way.  He's Buljo.  Buljo.  That's what we call him.  Yeah.  Buljo.  But Ben's like, I went to bed at 8 and I got up at 5.  And he was surprised he slept that long.  But it might have been the extra strength cold medicine and a couple pints.  Hanging out drinking.  There's some of his...  He knows people everywhere.  I'm in the lobby of the hotel and there's people coming up to me.  Hey, I was supposed to meet Ben at half hour, 45 minutes.  Oh, he's talking about he's gotten 17 phone calls from people and they're here to, like, hook up with him?  Yeah. 
[00:19:30]  I don't know how he knows these people.  I'm like, I know he was...  You know, I know he's under the weather and he took some cold medicine.  Maybe he's crashing.  Where is he?  I know he's flying in his room, combing his hair with a fan and a machine gun.  So sad you're sick today, Jim.  Oh.  Take away his puke bucket and get even with him.  Go ahead.  I've heard Ben before the show in the green room is telling us that we're not doing Vegas right.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  What were you saying?  Ben Vegas?  I want to call him Ben Vegas.  Ben has, like, a theory on Vegas.  He says the first time you come to Vegas, you just let it all out, right?  Well, no, you were saying we're all going to bed early. 
[00:20:00]  And I said I went to bed early.  And I thought about it last night.  I'm like, but, you know, the first time you come to Vegas, you go completely nuts.  And then to everyone who's like, this is the first time we've been to Vegas in quite a few years anyway.  Yeah, but you've been here before.  Yeah.  I hope he's been here.  Jim's really there.  I think it gets ugly after this radio show.  Tonight will be our next time.  Tomorrow will definitely be an awful, hungover-type radio program.  I went right to the tables after this show yesterday.  Went right to the table.  But what I didn't realize is we should probably go back to the room and nap, take that nap after the show because we kind of get up early to do this. 
[00:20:30]  And then spend the rest of the night hanging out because by 7 o'clock, 7 o'clock, what the hell happened to us?  I was shot.  I was shot.  I've been sitting at the table for, you know, six, seven hours or whatever it was.  And I was shot.  I looked at the watch expecting to see, you know, 4 in the morning, feeling like that.  And it's 7 o'clock at night.  Now, did you win any money last night? 
[00:21:00]  No, I dropped like 200.  But I was playing for a long time.  And I screwed up.  It was one of those things where you do the slow build and you're fine.  You'll watch your chip stack go up.  And then when you're ready to leave, you kind of do those bonehead moves where you, all right, let me try to double this or I'll, you know, make some big bets and undo, that kind of thing.  And you break your strategy and you wind up giving back what you had won plus more.  And that's kind of what I did.  But I kind of felt like I wasn't really blowing it big time because it was kind of money that I had for food and stuff. 
[00:21:30]  I hadn't been to the ATM yet.  It was just kind of like bar cabbage that you had stuffed in front of your pocket.  Yeah, yeah, because we hadn't gone out.  What about that guy that just was messing up the whole table?  This is when I went to the minimum bet for quite a few hands because the guy showed up.  Everyone that comes to Vegas, Atlantic City, wherever you are, the guy shows up at the table.  It was kind of a young guy in a suit, probably here for the convention, a little tipsy. 
[00:22:00]  He sits down, pulls out.  We're at the $5 minimum table hanging out.  He pulls out a $20 bill and gets five chips, you know, or four chips.  What is that, 5, 10, 15, 20?  Four chips.  They threw him an extra one.  That math.  That math can be a bitch sometimes.  Stunns me sometimes.  Yeah, he gets his four chips, slides his five bucks in on the circle.  And he's dealt something like a nine.  Not a 19.  He's got nine.  And the dealer's showing a face card. 
[00:22:30]  Comes around to him and he goes, I'll stick.  And the table now just starts looking at each other like, uh-oh, we're in trouble.  We got one of these guys on board that has no clue what he's doing.  He's got a nine.  He's sticking.  He's got a nine.  He's sticking with the dealer showing a queen.  Unbelievable.  So the dealer goes, you know, you got a nine.  You know, you hit that.  And he looks around and he goes, oh, hit me.  And then the dealer goes, no, you got to tap if you want to hit or wave it off if you want to stay. 
[00:23:00]  He goes, oh.  And he starts waving.  And then the dealer's like, no, you want to hit?  Tap the tip.  And now we're all just panicked looking around the tip.  I'm looking at my bet like, bye.  Bye-bye, whatever it was because this guy's just going to screw up by the numbers.  And later on, he's, you know, the dealer's showing that six.  And he's pulling a 14.  And what does he do?  Hit me.  And the table wanted to right in the face.  You get those guys.  They come up. 
[00:23:30]  Sometimes you get a real good table going.  And everyone knows each other.  Sometimes people stop hitting, knowing that a face card hasn't come up in a while.  Seeing that the guy next to him has an 11, he's going to double down, let him get the chance of hitting the face.  And the table's like working with each other.  And it works well.  Then someone leaves and you get a new guy coming.  You're like, ah, here comes disaster.  And that's what you got to deal with.  So I'm just putting out five bucks until this guy left.  We all got to get a table after the show.  Oh, hell yeah.  All of us should hook up.  Oh, Ben, were you playing a little last night? 
[00:24:00]  How'd you do?  I was out about 40 bucks.  I don't know.  I was winning on the electronic blackjack with Laszlo.  Are you playing the right at the bar?  Yeah, but I won 20 bucks.  I actually lost $3.50 on a machine called Prostitute.  There you go.  Yeah, you were playing the ATM machine.  You play that a lot.  Yeah.  Well, you are gambling.  I don't wear bags, so.  Yeah, that is gambling.  You are taking quite a risk. 
[00:24:30]  I notice you have your back to the crowd.  You don't even want to know the looks you're getting when you say what you're saying.  I'm just not feeling too well, so I'm kind of, you know.  Do you want, Ben, the girls from Playboy, why don't we get them up to say hi real fast  before our first break, and then we'll get Laszlo on after the break.  Everyone knows who Laszlo is from Grand Theft Auto.  Most people that are feeling a little ill, Opie, they take their temperature or whatnot.  I don't know.  Maybe here, there's so much new technology here.  Do they have a T-cell counter here that maybe we could get Jimmy to take a test? 
[00:25:00]  You really do take some chances here in Vegas.  Yeah.  It just can't happen to me.  You're playing the old...  Oh, the girls aren't here?  You're playing the old bareback, are you?  Yeah.  Yeah, of course.  It's all good.  Where are the girls, Opie?  They're not here, so why don't we take...  Where are they?  They're going to come back, so we'll do Laszlo and the girls from the Playboy channel  after the break.  I want to wear condoms on my hands handling the chips sometimes with some of the people  at the table.  Get these, like, Asian guys just smoking and coughing into their hands, and then they lose 
[00:25:30]  and you win the same amount, and the dealer just slides their chips over to you.  I don't want this guy's...  He's got SARS all over his chips.  You know what?  Jimmy's a pro.  He don't care.  While you were gambling, I had to hang out with the agent, Super Agent Bob Eatman.  That's your problem.  I abandoned Bob.  I'm starting to understand it is my problem.  I'm with you now.  I don't understand why you didn't just ditch Bob.  It was an easy ditch.  Our agent came from L.A. to...  I don't know.  Did we have a big meeting in one of these rooms?  I don't even know. 
[00:26:00]  I fell asleep, because it was him and his buddy there that are two of the most boring  guys on the face of the earth.  I couldn't believe I was in Vegas and bored out of my mind, and then I just looked and  said, oh, it's because I'm here with Bob.  And Bob's like, hey, you want to play some...  You want to gamble a little bit?  What do you...  You know, you want to...  You have dinner plans?  I'm like, Bob, just get on a flight back to L.A.  Did he get chips?  Your family's missing you.  Did he get chips and ask the dealer for a receipt? 
[00:26:30]  That's Bob.  Oh, wait, can I have a receipt for those, please?  That's our agent, yes, Bob.  He paid taxes, you know, so...  What a dullard.  I finally ditched him.  Why would you hang with...  I'd rather eat tomato soup out of Voss's ear right now.  Why would you spend any time with Bob?  I really don't know.  You did.  I cut out.  I took the trip back to the hotel, and Obie's like, I'm going to hang out for, you know,  a little bit longer, and I was like, why would you do this to yourself?  Oh, I got you bad, though, in the green room.  Oh, you ditched me with somebody.  Well, she's a very nice girl, and she's a big fan of the show, but she likes to talk a lot. 
[00:27:00]  She's talking, talking, talking, just yapping, and Obie comes up with a great excuse.  It wasn't really good, because you even fooled me for a second.  We're in the green room, and I think she works for XM.  She's definitely cool.  I mean, she gets the job done, you know, on her show.  But it's non-stop talking.  Non-stop talking.  We couldn't get a word in, and I didn't know where one sentence stopped and one began.  It was just one, you know, long sentence.  And to tell you the truth, when you get done with the radio show, you kind of want to stop  talking for a little while. 
[00:27:30]  You know, you don't really want to...  You want to wind down a little bit, right?  Yeah.  And Ant and I have played this game for years.  We try to figure out how we're going to get out of that situation.  And we ditch him on the other person.  And all of a sudden, I'm just like, oh, oh my God, I forgot.  I got to talk to Bob really fast before he leaves, and I just ditched you.  Yeah, he walks out.  Oh, but you didn't just leave right before you shut the door.  He peeks his head in and gives this smile like, I just screwed you ass.  And now I'm sitting there with him.  She's talking, talking.  And I was like, oh, what time did they say the car was coming to pick us up? 
[00:28:00]  And my girlfriend goes, oh, any minute now.  So we walk outside.  But then we're standing right in front of the door to the room that we just left saying  we had to leave immediately for like 10 more minutes.  And I think after 10 minutes, she walked out and saw us still standing there, which is kind  of the giveaway, too.  But she didn't stop talking.  Definitely nice, bud.  All right, we'll take a break.  We'll get Laszlo here to talk about CES.  There is a lot of cool stuff that they're showing off here.  Yeah, we don't know a lot of the stuff that's going on, but he's definitely plugged into the 
[00:28:30]  whole thing.  And we got Julie and Tiffany from the Playboy channel.  You see the creeps that were getting pictures with the girls?  Yeah, I saw a few of them.  I think they're all gone so we can talk about them now.  It's always creepy when guys take pictures with Playboy girls.  I want to see if they're going to be honest, because these guys lining up, they were scary.  And they all wanted pictures of the hot Playboy girls.  What do you do with those pictures?  I mean, it's nice to have and everything, but it's not like a picture of De Niro with,  you know, you show it, everyone knows who it is.  What do you do with the hot girl picture?  You're still rubbing it into him. 
[00:29:00]  Always.  He doesn't have the De Niro picture.  Yesterday, there was a picture of De Niro in the paper with some architect.  And I was like, look, an architect who got their picture with him and not little Jimmy.  Nothing.  The reason, I don't know, they get pictures of these Playboy girls, they just want to show  their stupid friends.  Like, here's a girl.  Yeah, but what is it?  It's not like they came over and were hanging in a bar and the girl found him exciting and  decided to take a picture.  It's a line of guys taking pictures with these Playboy chicks.  Yeah.  It's silly.  All right.  You know, going into break, remember we were talking to Kevin Kennedy yesterday?  Yes.  And he's going to do Major League Baseball coverage for XM Satellite Radio. 
[00:29:30]  Yeah.  A really cool guy, by the way.  I think we're going to try to get him on the show on a regular basis doing some baseball  stuff for us.  Such a sports guy, too.  He's got the look and the attitude and everything.  But he has no problem telling the stories.  No, no, I understand that.  He got into the steroid thing, which I didn't think he was going to yesterday.  You could definitely tell he was that guy that was just really good in gym class when  you were like just a jerk off, walking around there, stumbling around, not knowing  what to do.  And he was always, you know, the guy that got picked first.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Just like your typical sports guy. 
[00:30:00]  Right.  Walk around in a towel, you couldn't take your eyes off him.  All right, so we were mentioning the Earl Weaver clip.  Oh, right.  And he said that he has the clip.  And I think...  Uh-oh, uh-oh.  Are we allowed to play this?  Ooh.  Well, it's going to...  Is Elo going to come over and hit a button?  It's going to get a little saucy out there.  A little racy, a little blue.  It's going to get a little saucy, everyone.  It's Earl Weaver just losing his mind after a game, I guess.  It was the post-game show or something.  It's one of our favorite clips.  We haven't played it in a while. 
[00:30:30]  Yeah.  And we'll play this going into break.  And when we come back, it'll be Laszlo and the girls from the Playboy channel.  It's Sophie and Anthony live from CES in Las Vegas, Nevada.  Check this out.  Now, the manager's corner with the thoughts and opinions of the American League's winningest  manager, the Oilers, Earl Weaver.  Today's show is sponsored by Baltimore's six best, your area Oldsmobile dealers, Anderson  Olds, Schaefer and Storminger Olds, Lee Oldsmobile, Metro Olds, City Olds, and Stuberger Olds.  And now, to the manager's corner with Earl Weaver. 
[00:31:00]  Well, Bill Whitehouse, Earl, that certainly is an answer.  From Frederick Merriman, wants to know why you and the Orioles don't go out and get some  more team speed.  Team speed, for Christ's sake.  You get fucking goddamn little fleas on a fucking basis, getting picked off, trying to steal,  getting thrown out, taking runs away from you.  You get them big cocksuckers that can hit the fucking ball out of the ballpark, and you  can't make any goddamn mistake.  Well, certainly, this show is going to get out in history, Earl. 
[00:31:30]  Terry Elliott of Washington, D.C., wants to know why you don't use Terry Crowley as a  designated hitter all the time.  Well, Terry Crowley's lucky he's in fucking baseball, for Christ's sake.  He was released by the Cincinnati Reds.  He was released by the fucking goddamn Atlanta Braves.  We thought that Terry Crowley could sit on his fucking ass for eight innings and enjoy  watching a baseball game, just like any other fan, and has the ability to get up there and  break one open in a fucking night.  So, if this cocksucker'd mind his own business, and let me manage the fucking team, we'd be 
[00:32:00]  a lot better off.  Well, certainly, you've made your opinions known on the fans' questions about baseball,  Earl, but let's get to something else.  Alice Sweet from Norfolk wants to know the best time to put in a tomato plant.  Alice Sweet ought to be worried about where the fuck her next lane's coming from, rather  than where her next goddamn tomato plant's coming from.  If she'd get her ass out to fucking bars at night and go hustling around the goddamn  street, she might get a prick stuck in her once in a while.  I don't understand where these questions are coming from, Tom. 
[00:32:30]  That's about it from Manager's Corner.  Go fuck yourself, and the fuck with your show coming up next on the Baltimore Oriole Baseball  Fucking Network.  Yeah!  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Live from Las Vegas.  Yeah!  It's like watching a bunch of retards flying to hop a doorknob out.  Yeah!  That's what we do.  Because we're perverts.

It's an Opie and Anthony WoW sticker stop. 
[00:34:30]  This Wednesday, January 12th, get to the Acme Oyster House in the French Quarter in New Orleans, Louisiana,  and pick up your WoW stickers.  Whoa!  Those aren't real.  Yes, they are.  Lunchtime at the Acme Oyster House, 724 Iberville Street, New Orleans, Louisiana.  I'm getting an erection as we speak.  Once again, here is how it should sound.  The WoW sticker stop.  Brought to you by your pals at the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:35:00]  XM202.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  And we're back broadcasting live in Las Vegas, Nevada at the CES.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America. 
[00:35:30]  We got the girls from the Playboy channel coming up in a few minutes, Anthony.  Julie and Tiffany, they do a great job on that channel, man.  I think it's Florentine's favorite channel on XM Satellite Radio, right?  Yeah, he likes Playboy very much.  Really?  Well, he likes it because, you know, he's driving to a lot of gigs.  And didn't you tell me he has to bring tissues in his car just because of that channel?  Yeah, he said he's actually pulled over and whacked his bag.  Which I kind of respect.  We'll have to bring it up to the girls face-to-face.  But first, we're going to bring in Laszlo. 
[00:36:00]  Yeah.  Laszlo is probably the coolest guy on earth.  And I'll tell you why.  Legend.  Because I got to gamble with Ben last night.  Oh, you were gambling with Ben?  Yeah.  How'd that work out?  Oh, dude, he's like the Tasmanian Wookiee.  That video poker, he's just nuts.  He doesn't know what he's hitting half the time.  No, is he herking, jerking, hitting buttons?  He's like, oh, I didn't want to hit that yet.  Hold it, hold it. 
[00:36:30]  No, no, I want one.  Right, right.  Is he gossiping all night, too?  Oh, dude, and I'm, like, betting really slow because I like to make the money last.  Right.  Dude, the Eagles are going to be playing wins plays for the next two years, but no one knows it yet.  It hasn't been announced.  I'm trying to get my money.  And then, like, his hands are slapping.  And then, meanwhile, I'm going so slow, my machine freezes up.  So, the bartender, like, barkeep, you know, I'd like to gamble here.  And he comes over, and he's like, uh, give it a whack.  And I'm like, pardon me?  This big piece of electronics, you want me to just Fonzarelli it?  And so, I'm, like, beating on this thing, waiting for security to come over. 
[00:37:00]  He's like, oh, that ain't working.  Kick it.  And so, I'm in the MGM Grand, like, kicking this machine.  Did it free up?  No, the woman had to come over and do the control, delete, or whatever.  That's actually the same advice you give if a child is misbehaving.  Right.  Whack it a little, then kick it.  But he's the coolest in our eyes, because he got us in GTA San Andreas.  That was very cool.  But I was asking him at the bar, I'm like, dude, when do I get to hear myself?  I've been playing the game for a month and a half. 
[00:37:30]  He goes, are you two-thirds of the way done yet?  And I'm like, uh, well, I think I've done five or six missions.  Because he told me, he goes, most people, when they play GTA, they get through half of the game, and then they start screwing off.  Because it's just, it turns out to be cooler to just screw off after a while.  Or they decide to go get their wizard cloak and stop playing entirely.  That's true.  They've got to go to different games.  I've been playing EverQuest 2.  Are you done?  It's never done.  That game is never done.  You just keep playing it.  You're ever questing. 
[00:38:00]  Ever questing.  Ever questing.  You know when the game's over, when you finally die, that's pretty much it.  I still have my account for the original Ever quest, and there's no way I could cancel it.  I haven't played it in months, but I keep paying it, and you just can't cancel it.  All the work and years that went into building that character, you can't just eliminate it.  So they have figured out a way to have people pay them for a service you no longer use.  It's brilliant.  It really is brilliant, and geeks all over, including me, just keep paying off. 
[00:38:30]  And there's so many of those games coming out now, like at the Electronic Entertainment  Expo last year.  Everybody wants one of those games where they can get people to pay $10, and they're really  into it, and then they're in love with that character.  You know what it is, though?  It's kind of tooting the horn for EverQuest and EverQuest 2, even, because it's hard to  come up with a good game in that whole massive multiplayer online gaming.  There's so many of them out there that just suck. 
[00:39:00]  Oh, absolutely.  They stink.  You need so much content in those games that you're kind of finding something new or different  to do on a daily basis.  Some of them are so linear and so just boring.  But you play EverQuest 2, there's plenty of stuff going on in there, and that's kind  of what hooked me into it.  Have you guys looked at the rest of the show at all?  Just in the general area, we saw the Hummer with the 12 screens.  That's always necessary.  And with the rockets on the side of the thing as you're driving. 
[00:39:30]  What are the rockets for?  I don't know, man.  Those are big bazooka speakers.  This is the most ridiculous hall of the whole show.  Yeah.  I mean, this show is enormous.  Just football fields and football fields of nonsense.  And this is where all the car stuff is.  You know, like, oh, I need neon under there.  And the booth babes in this hall are the raunchiest of the entire show.  I like that.  The raunchiest.  Because, I mean, you go to each one and it's like, oh, great, more car speakers.  You know, that looks kind of the same.  Oh, but they got chicks.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:40:00]  They got chicks bending over inside the car, you know, playing.  What I really love is when they get head-to-head video gaming inside the car.  So you can, like, be in the back seat and playing against somebody in the front seat.  That's cool.  That's kind of the whole thing with a lot of the onboard video in the cars is kind of new.  Before that, what did they just have?  Was it all audio?  And that was it when you come to these shows?  Yes.  Like, years ago, it was just how many speakers could you fit in these things?  The migraines you would get in this hall.  Boom, boom, boom, boom. 
[00:40:30]  It was like you were in the Bronx.  Yeah, yeah.  It was out of control.  It was just everything rattling.  Right.  But now it's all about the video, so it's kind of calmed down with people trying to blast your ears out.  And they've got this dish over there that I just checked out from RaySat that you get Internet to the car.  And it's a wireless mode, too, so that you can have several different people on their laptops, in the car, all online, all doing separate things.  And it's like a Wi-Fi in your car.  Right.  That's pretty cool.  And I was talking to the guy.  I'm like, oh, so this is great.  So I can be, like, downloading porn while driving. 
[00:41:00]  I'm watching a movie, playing a game.  In a chat room.  Oh, and then there's the driving part.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I've got to drive this thing.  I've got to drive this thing.  Yeah, we saw some vehicles with little TV monitors in the steering wheel.  Now, if that isn't for the driver, because they could get away with it by saying, well, this TV's for the passenger.  That's why we put it over by the glove compartment or something like that, or on the visor.  But when it's in the steering wheel, it's pretty much the driver's TV screen.  And the ridiculous thing is, like, well, the car has to be in park. 
[00:41:30]  You know, it will not run.  And then you start talking to the guy at the booth for a while, and he's like, well, there's a switch on the back.  You know, you switch it, and then you're watching, you know, Debbie does Dallas when you're going down the road.  Oh, it's that little switch.  You're making a right-hand turn on the money shot.  It looks like it's coming under the feet.  So what else have you seen at the CES?  Ben, gambling.  I saw this Swiss Army knife.  It's got the, like, USB memory thing in it. 
[00:42:00]  Oh, yeah.  How is this going to ever come?  Dude, there's more garbage at this show.  And all these other, like, tech radio show people come in, but the revolution's here, ladies and gentlemen.  And I come, and I'm like, God, half of this is garbage.  It's just trash you'd have in your drawer somewhere and never use it.  Right.  I mean, you know, when you go up, any man that would buy something called the Pocket Surfer is just, like, the Pocket Surfer.  What's the Pocket Surfer?  There's all these devices now that are going to be, like, portable video devices so that you can sort of record stuff from your computer into it and take it on the road. 
[00:42:30]  There's also some TiVo-like devices so that it sits next to your digital video recorder, and everything that you record goes into that as well.  So when you're going to be on the bus or the train on the way to work, you can, you know, watch all your favorite shows.  You're basically taking your TiVo with you.  Right.  So.  That's not too bad, though.  That's kind of, I could see actually maybe using that.  Although, what's wrong with the DVDs and the DVD player on the bus or the plane or something like that? 
[00:43:00]  TiVo, you can get TV, you know, you can get live TV.  You can't get it on the DVD.  Yeah.  I barely watch live TV anymore, never mind recorded.  No kidding.  It just stinks.  Everything now is DVDs.  That's it.  Well, everything now is reality garbage.  Yeah.  There's a story about reality TV on CNN, right?  The rat guy?  Oh, yeah.  Someone is suing Fear Factor.  Now, you would think the first one of their episodes.  One of the lawsuits from Fear Factor would be somebody maybe being on the show and getting injured or, you know, something.  Because I watch the show sometimes and I wonder how the hell people don't die on this thing. 
[00:43:30]  And it was the rat eating episode.  You said you had seen this?  Yeah.  I think they, was it the one where they put the rats in the blender?  Yeah.  They were blending rats and then eating whatever was in the blender.  Nice, right?  Right.  Blended rat.  A little pita.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm sure they were none too happy.  We did rat eating on our program about three years ago.  That's how we met Frenchie.  Frenchie, right.  The annoying French chef.  We got a French chef to actually cook up a rat.  I mean, these were, you know, subway rats.  They were disgusting.  They weren't from a...  Big, man.  They were huge. 
[00:44:00]  Yeah, they weren't from like a pet store.  These were the real deal.  And we got two cooks.  We got a French chef and then just some guy that reminded us of Jeffrey Dahmer.  Yeah.  I mean, no joke.  And this guy pretty much skinned him, shoved a stick in his mouth and rotated it over an open flame.  Right.  And then the French chef guy, who, yeah, he's Frenchie now on the show, he made rat au poivre that people that ate it were asking for seconds.  Really?  And this was supposed to be...  He ruined the contest because it was supposed to be so disgusting that the person that wouldn't eat the most of it, you know, they were eliminated. 
[00:44:30]  And then the person that ate the most would win the prize.  And people are like, you got any more of that?  Yeah.  Amazing.  I prepared it in an au poivre pepper sauce, gently sautéed with mushroom.  And it was fantastic.  The scent of rat wafting through the studio was making everyone hungry.  I love it.  It smelled good, right?  Yeah.  I remember.  But we still didn't taste it, but...  And then the other guys was just a bloody mess.  People were puking with the other guys.  It was the same meat. 
[00:45:00]  So anyway, Fear Factor did this rat blender thing.  Yeah, now they're being sued not by a contestant, which is what I thought it was going to be.  Somebody at home.  Ugh.  Was watching it and started vomiting from watching it.  So they're suing Fear Factor.  It doesn't have a dollar.  Oh, wait.  2.5 million?  2.5 million.  That sounds fair.  That's fair for throwing up, for watching a show and throwing up.  So can I now sue Mariano Rivera for blowing that lead?  He's like, cute.  That really stinks. 
[00:45:30]  And he threw up, and because he was disoriented, he ran into a doorway, which would be funny to watch.  But yeah, being sued, Fear Factor.  Did you guys have anything to do with the doggy outside?  There's a, you know, the doggy was deflated this morning.  Was it deflated?  Did an enormous, enormous, enormous doggy.  I figured you had somebody knife it.  Leaking air like the company's leaking money.  I don't understand why we get blamed for everything that happens.  I know.  Everything.  Oh, vandalism.  Must be those guys. 
[00:46:00]  I don't know what you're talking about.  I actually saw a phone yesterday, smaller than Ben's.  Really?  I swear to God, it's like a Tic Tac.  It's like you eat it and talk on the phone or something.  They're kind of running out of things to do with the phone.  Oh, absolutely.  You know, they, they, I, I, and I'm one of the biggest suckers with the cell phones.  I want the latest, newest cell phone.  I want to be able to surf the internet with it.  I want video.  I want to be able to take nice pictures, not these archaic pictures.  I need some, you know, I need some megapixels in there and then I buy one and a week later 
[00:46:30]  there's something better or that they say is better.  But you know what?  You buy the phone.  You feel good about yourself.  I got the latest technology.  Look how cool this is.  Yeah.  And then it takes one stupid person to come up to you with a better phone.  You're like, oh, my phone's crap.  Yeah.  Where do I get yours?  And then you buy that one and it turns out to be crap.  I don't know.  They just don't quite have it yet.  I want to be able to surf the internet on my phone the way I do on my computer.  And it's just not there.  You get these crappy websites that are just made for your phone and they're awful. 
[00:47:00]  Half of them you can't get to.  They take so long to download anything.  You're not getting graphics.  They do have it, though.  They say you are, but you're not.  They won't release it.  They just won't release it until everybody buys this one.  Then they release the next one.  It's sick.  There's no real set format either.  They're kind of different formats for it.  Yeah.  You know, I just want to, like they show on the commercials.  People surfing.  You see any cool phones out there?  Did you go to the phone area?  We haven't even found that area yet.  We haven't left the obnoxious car area.  No, I went to the home theater section. 
[00:47:30]  Oh, you did?  That was pretty cool.  Yeah.  You've got to check out the karaoke section, too.  That is...  Oh, stop.  Dude, it's full of Asians.  Were the Asian guys there?  They love the karaoke.  It is out of...  There's one that I checked out yesterday.  I was talking to the woman.  And it's got pitch correction technology on it.  Wow.  If you're singing like garbage, the computer kicks in and takes you to the real key.  It'll put you on the right key, no matter what you're sounding like.  No, the point is for you to sound stupid.  Right.  Of course.  That's what it's all about.  Hit me with your best shot.  Unbelievable.  The Asians, they love the karaoke. 
[00:48:00]  A whole section?  A whole section of karaoke.  And there's people doing it.  Oh, it's nuts.  And they love to gamble.  And I was talking to them, and I go, is this ever, please, going to just go away?  I mean, can we be done with this?  And she's like, oh, no, the market, and, you know, it's really coming to the United States now.  It's going to be in every bar.  And I'm like, well, this is why I stay home and get drunk.  Yeah.  Definitely don't want to hear that.  I'm going to have to go over there.  We might have to tape some of these people.  Sing it.  While you're over there, see if you can get Kevin a new mobile phone so that every time you call him,  it doesn't sound like he's holding a drill up to it. 
[00:48:30]  Oh, man.  Your boss.  Is he your boss?  Straylo?  Yeah.  Straylo's one of them.  Whatever.  He's one of the mothership of executives.  I guess technically he's one of our bosses.  Sure.  Well, he's the head guy at talk programming.  If he wants to feel like he's our boss, sure, okay, we'll give him that.  Yeah.  Okay.  But he does have the worst phone.  It is the worst thing.  I will never buy a trio after hearing him.  I have a trio.  I refuse to use the phone part.  No, I don't use the phone.  I'll surf the Internet.  I'll get my email.  You know, a little this, a little that.  But, yeah, he calls. 
[00:49:00]  It's ridiculous.  It sounds like he's got a power drill right up to it.  He's like, ah, Laszlo, hello?  Here we are in the information age.  Great.  He's brushing his teeth with a drill though.  Oh, we got Frenchie on the line.  Should we go to him real fast?  Oh, of course.  All right.  Let's say hi to Frenchie.  Hey, Frenchie, what's up?  Hello, guys.  Happy New Year.  Happy New Year.  Do you think you could keep it a little clean for our live audience today, Frenchie, instead  of that potty mouth?  Thank you for letting me know.  Otherwise, I was going to swear like a sailor. 
[00:49:30]  You got anything for the show today, Frenchie?  Yes.  You're just happy that we mentioned you.  Well, yes, I know.  You were talking about the rat.  Right?  Of course.  Okay.  And that people loved it when I cooked the rat with a little sauce of poivre.  Remember when you did that?  That was awesome.  You might want to reiterate that again.  What happened.  So what's up, Frenchie?  We'll make some snakes the next time, if you like.  Snake?  You can cook up snake? 
[00:50:00]  Of course I can.  I can cook anything.  I have alligator in my freezer at work.  How about you cook up some material?  Yeah.  You know, not for nothing, but Andrea Yates made a funnier call to 911.  Are you there, too?  You haven't lost your mind in Vegas, huh, Norton?  Well, he has an upset tummy.  I'm sick, man.  He's sick.  Poor little Jimmy.  He's got nothing.  You have nothing today, huh, French?  I think you'll be going to make use of that stylus.  Oh, okay. 
[00:50:30]  Frenchie, thanks for calling.  All right.  Take it easy, guys.  He was just very excited that we talked about his rat cooking.  He had to call the program.  Anything else that you've seen, Laszlo?  Worth mentioning?  No, it's garbage.  It's just all garbage.  I've got to take a walk because this place is huge, and I haven't been to the home center.  Yeah.  Opie was there.  What is it?  It's set up like real homes?  It's amazing.  They've got living rooms and stuff.  The home automation stuff.  There's so many companies pushing this, and it's from a complete paranoia level.  Really?  Oh, it's nuts.  It's just like, your kids could die. 
[00:51:00]  You know, like, so you need a sensor, so the second that they open any door in the house,  you know, it pops up in an instant message on your computer at work.  You've got to go over there.  It's amazing.  That the kid has left cell block C, and now he's in the middle of the house.  This guy was showing me, well, you know, they've got the watches for kids now, so that  parents can get online and see their exact location on a map at any time.  You know, really.  Oh, dude, it's like, why don't you just give the kid the ankle bracelet?  The ankle bracelet, you know?  Just ridiculous.  How many parents are going to use that for the kid's safety, but you could also use it 
[00:51:30]  to see where, you know, your little girl is at night.  Maybe she says she's going to a movie.  You can pop it up and see if she's at a certain address and not at Jimmy Norton's house.  You see the little blip on the map going up and down real fast, and you know what she's doing?  What's even more ridiculous, on the map you can set red zones.  Like, Jimmy Norton's house, you can, like, make a red zone.  Get out of here.  And when the little blip goes, the alarms go off.  So if there's some boy that she's not supposed to see.  Wow.  Yeah.  Wow.  That's crazy.  How about that? 
[00:52:00]  Dude, there are going to be more psychologists making tons of dough in about 15 to 20 years.  How about technology's probably there to have somebody, if you don't want your child hanging  out with a certain person, and you get into cahoots with their parents, you'd give the  kid another watch, and then if the two get together, the alarm would go off.  Yeah, it explodes and blows their hands off.  And then Ted Nugent can hold it or hold the thing.  And you know, how easy is that going to be to conquer?  You just take the watch off and leave it in the library. 
[00:52:30]  Well, if you take it off, it might set off an alarm, too.  Like the ankle bracelet would.  You could really get into some really scary stuff with this technology.  Oh, they even had this one.  This guy was showing me a dog bowl yesterday.  So that if the water, you know, gets, the dog drinks all the water or whatever, you get  a message on your phone.  Really?  I was like, dude, we do not need this much information, man, that your dog is out of  water.  What happened with leaving the toilet bowl lid open?  You know?  Dogs are fine as long as the toilet's open.  They should put a sensor on his ball so if he licks your face five minutes after he licks 
[00:53:00]  them, you know.  Dude, they had this taser set up over there where this guy said, I will give you $100 if  you can grab this out of my hand.  And they hooked the two electrodes up to you and like a foot away, and there's all these  like cocky frat boys over there like, yeah, I'm going to get $100.  Watch this.  And the guy holds up, he holds up the $100 bill, and the frat boy's about like two feet  away looking at all his buddies going, yeah, we're going to be the strippers tonight. 
[00:53:30]  And he goes, go.  And the guy hits the button, and his face goes, just welds up and stuck, falls over on the  ground just like a rock.  That was a great face for radio.  Wow.  The tongue goes out to the side.  They're really tasering people at this place?  Dude, I did this demo.  It was unbelievable.  Fantastic.  That really is cool.  I was waiting for like the heart attack.  Yeah.  The legal form.  I'm sure.  We will not do it in our show.  Can we get that for the studio?  Wouldn't that be great? 
[00:54:00]  Oh, that would be great.  Studio, how great would that be on a date?  Are you in the mood?  That sounded like a yes.  All right.  Well, I'm going to have to take a walk.  I'm missing everything.  All I'm seeing are stupid cars or videos.  The home section is just off the hook.  Is that in this building or no?  Dude, I don't even know.  I think that part is in another state.  The most ridiculous thing I've heard of so far was the wave runner with a TV in it.  Because when you're out on the waves on a personal watercraft, what you want to do is be watching television. 
[00:54:30]  It's all about video this year at CES.  It is.  Like he was saying earlier, even satellite radio, we're all bragging about the video technology that's coming.  Yeah, they got the big Escalade over there, and there's some type of video in there.  Dude, when they start streaming video of this show to people's cars, you are going to get sued 800 ways from Sunday.  Absolutely.  There are going to be people like, cherry darts.  I hit a bus.  I got erotic.  I got caught in the steering wheel.  I hit a bus.  Hey, can we do cherry darts tomorrow? 
[00:55:00]  At the Ford convention?  Are they allowed to get naked over there?  No, the Venetian's very strict.  Oh, really?  They're real C-blockers.  They are.  I was walking out yesterday, and there's this hot, like, I think she was a whore.  She had like a half of a little bikini bottom, and she was dressed, but the security made her wrap her coat around her waist.  You can't walk around with like a thong?  No, it wasn't a thong, though, but it was like short shorts.  I don't mean her, I mean you.  Oh, yeah, no.  No?  On my face, but I can't see.  Yeah, no, so they made her put a jacket over it, because you have to dress appropriately when you're, you know, robbing somebody of their children's college tuition. 
[00:55:30]  Scumbag casinos.  I heard that they show videos at the displays, but they have to be edited, and like no money shots.  No, they're dirty, though, but they can't show, you know.  They can't show like money shots.  Everything, right, right, right.  Yeah.  Wow.  Anthony, let's go to the phones.  Henri wants to comment about Frenchy's last phone call.  Henri, he's the new Frenchy.  Yeah.  Because Frenchy sucks so bad on the air that the new Frenchy is now on the show.  And I believe Henri, he knows Frenchy just bombed, and he wants to rub it in now, right?  Right.  Henri, what's up? 
[00:56:00]  Yeah, well, that is one of the reasons I called, because I heard him call up, and it sounded like he was recovering from his New Year's party, where I'm sure two people showed up and one was a baby.  So I just wanted to say that, and hope you guys are having a good time out there.  And Norton, make sure to bring a lot of keychains and herpes, okay?  A lot of what and herpes?  Keychains.  Bring home a lot of keychains and herpes for us, okay?  Yeah, bring back souvenirs for everybody.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, I guess.  All right, all right.  Yeah, exactly. 
[00:56:30]  We were talking about car keys.  I thought it was like a swinging party or something.  Yeah, right?  Leave your keys in the basket.  Jimmy just goes in and steals all the keys.  Bye, everybody.  The French are bombing today on our program.  All right.  Well, thank you, Lazlo.  Anything else that you forgot to mention?  No?  No.  What game do you play in these days?  Anything?  I'm still playing GTA.  Are you?  And I'm playing a little Doom 3.  Are you playing some Doom 3?  You check out Half-Life 2 at all?  No.  No?  Yeah, I've been playing that.  It's kind of cool.  Nice, good graphics. 
[00:57:00]  All right, very psyched.  As we go to break, we're going to play his Monster Rain spot that he did for us.  Oh, yes.  Do we have to explain Monster Rain, you think?  No, because the listeners know what it is.  Monster Rain.  You think the listeners know?  Yeah.  If they don't, they'll catch it on a repeat.  If you don't, go to foundyourmusic.com, and I'm sure you can look it up.  Well, Monster Rain is a thing that Jimmy used to do as a kid under the porch with other  little boys when the rain was coming.  It wasn't really rain, though.  I would, we would, me and my little friend would walk around, and we would yell Monster  Rain, and then we would hide under the porch to stay away from the Monster Rain, and while 
[00:57:30]  we were under the porch, we would perform oral sex on each other, because that's what  you do when you're avoiding the rain.  And you should avoid the eye contact that you're getting right now.  Oh, I don't want to tell that story.  Don't even look that way.  You don't want to look that way.  No, no, no.  You were just little kids.  Did you do it on sunny days, too, or just when you thought there was a rain cloud in  the area?  Yeah, it wasn't really contingent on the weather.  Any day that ended with a Y.  Tuesday, Wednesday.  Laszlo is a friend of the show, and he put this together, and you've got to do our show 
[00:58:00]  more often, bro.  I'm into it.  Yeah, right on.  We'll do some tech stuff.  Just as soon as you go back to afternoons, dude.  Yeah, I know.  Oh, yeah.  I did morning radio.  It is so tough to get used to the schedule.  We don't even know what time it is now.  I don't know.  Is it late back in New York?  Is it morning still over there?  All I know is 7 o'clock last night, I felt like it was 4 in the morning.  I'd been gambling, and it was like, whoa, what time is it?  7, and I have to go back to the room, and, yeah, I need my sleep.  I'm so tired.  Let me put in a movie. 
[00:58:30]  Ugh.  I'm disgusting.  And we're in Vegas.  We only have one hour of radio to do.  I know.  We're halfway done with the show today.  Ooh, I'm exhausted.  When we come back, are the Playboy...  Okay, the Playboy chicks are here, and George Wallace is going to stop by and say hi.  Ooh.  And Penn was supposed to stop by, but what was the excuse?  We get more excuses from publicists and agents and managers.  We get these big names to come on the show, and then I guess they find out who we are  or something, and then it goes horribly wrong.  Yeah, Penn Gillette was supposed to come on.  What happened, Ben?  You can grab it for a second. 
[00:59:00]  He's sick.  He's sick.  He wasn't eating that creamy tomato soup with Jimmy.  No, they'll never tell you the truth, man.  Or a big heaping bowl full.  He was fine to go.  He became sick.  Yeah.  He became sick.  All these faggot entertainers are so afraid of pissing off one person.  They can't just call and tell you, look, I can't do the show because of this or that.  They're going to lie and grovel.  Yeah, something's going on with that.  I bet he'll make his show tonight when he's got an arena full of people over there.  Of course he will.  He plays every night.  Oh, I'm sorry.  There wasn't a cash register.  All right. 
[00:59:30]  And when we get back, we've got to talk about the Michael Jackson story.  Maybe we can talk about that with the girls from Playboy, see if they've got any chops.  Chops on the Michael Jackson story?  Yeah.  It's a sex thing, kind of.  And that's what they do on Playboy radio, I think, when they're not reading erotic stories.  Right?  Yeah.  I've only listened to it a little bit, but it's actually very hot, what I've enjoyed.  All right.  We'll talk to them next.  But first, it's Monster Rain.  Laszlo did this.  Check it out.  He was just the boy next door.  Mikey, where are you?  It's a game for kids that's sweeping the country. 
[01:00:00]  What are you doing?  Jesus Christ, my little baby!  Monster Rain.  Monster Rain.  The game you play under the porch.  Monster Rain.  Monster Rain.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  From Las Vegas.  Live from Las Vegas.  I'm going to apologize for that. 
[01:00:30]  Stuck in their hotel rooms, because they're all pooping green from alcohol poisoning.  That is the sexiest thing I've ever seen.  That is good.  I like that.  The Opie and Anthony Show.

[01:03:00]  The O&A virus spreading across America.  We're in Las Vegas.  A very rainy Las Vegas at the CES. 
[01:03:30]  I think it's snowing in the mountains around here.  Yeah, it does that.  This happens, what, once a year?  It picked the weekend we're out here.  Yep.  It rains in the winter.  How are you feeling, Jimmy?  I'm all right, man.  I'm just a little bit deaf.  You don't feel like you're going to puke or anything, do you?  No.  No stomach cramps?  No, I still have my throat.  It's a little bit, like, anthocytic.  I'm all that vomit coming out.  God, can you imagine the maid that has to clean his room?  Oh.  Between the whores and what they're doing in there,  and just coming in a biohazard suit with a squeegee. 
[01:04:00]  Housekeeping.  That's what you hear.  You hear it from our uniform.  Housekeeping.  Housekeeping.  Very nice.  That's an awful job that has to be.  When is George Wallace coming?  A little later this hour?  He's in traffic.  He's in traffic.  Is that his excuse?  No, no.  He's funny.  All right.  George Wallace, very funny.  Yes.  We've had him on the show a bunch of fun.  The van driver's going,  and the van driver the whole time over is telling me  about what it could be that's making me sick. 
[01:04:30]  He's like, well, you know, it could be the tap water.  He's just making me feel worse and worse.  I'm like, just shut your fat face.  You're not helping.  Maybe it's the three greasy BLTs you had yesterday alone.  I'm sure it's the BLTs.  You think so?  You should not eat three BLTs in 24 hours.  There was a stack of bacon on this last one.  Of course there was.  That's all I tasted.  And you gobbled it all down?  Yeah.  Did you have all the grease around your mouth?  And when you wiped your mouth with a napkin,  it just made the napkin clear?  Well, my friend in Vegas that I was supposed to hang with,  of course, blew me off, as they all do.  So I'm just such a loser just shoving bacon into my fat face.  You know what sucks about the casinos and these hotels? 
[01:05:00]  They have all these really nice restaurants.  I went for a late dinner last night.  They all close at 1030.  So now we're sitting in, like, this awful diner-type place  that you could do back home.  You're supposed to eat earlier,  and then you spend the rest of the night gambling.  It's obvious they want you at the tables.  It's amazing because...  You can't make any money from you if you're eating.  A lot of people want to eat a little later in this town, you know?  But whatever.  Dan from Wisconsin has a problem.  Let's say hi to Dan.  Dan, what's up?  Danny.  Dan?  We got you? 
[01:05:30]  Yeah.  Hey, Dan, go ahead.  Julian and Tiffany aren't there yet, are they?  No, they're coming in a second.  Why are you going to bash them?  Because their show is lame.  They offer lame advice,  and I feel sorry for anyone who has to pay $4 a month for their show.  It's $2 a month.  $2?  No, it's $3.99 a month.  Oh, is it?  Oh.  So you don't like their show?  I like their show.  You do?  When I've heard of it, I've liked it.  Some of their advice is so lame.  And if you listen to some of the guys who call in asking for help, 
[01:06:00]  you know, they just pull whatever out of their butts, you know?  They're pulling stuff out of their butts, and you don't like that?  You sound like a guy who's an expert.  Maybe you should give advice.  Julie, this is a horrible way to meet, but this guy doesn't like your show.  Whatever.  He's like, I don't like this.  He's like, I don't think.  So the tsunami?  Sir, what's an example of advice that you think that was bad?  Maybe the advice was good.  She's got a problem with butt hair.  This guy calls in, and he's talking about butt hair or whatever. 
[01:06:30]  She's like, shave it off, you know?  No girl deserves to go through that.  But his girlfriend or something says that she actually likes it.  Don't shave it.  Just trim it.  Yeah.  Hello?  Can you imagine shaving your a-hole?  No.  When it grows back?  Just keep it trimmed.  I mean, put a lick around there.  We don't want pubes, you know?  Like you're holding a pin cushion between your teeth.  Right, exactly.  It's no good.  Dude, there's something to be said for a smooth hiney, 
[01:07:00]  and I'm not just quoting the Michael Jackson article again,  which we really got to get to in a few minutes here.  All right, well, Dan, you don't like the show.  There's plenty of people that are enjoying them.  You know what?  That's why XM has over, what, 100 stations?  Right.  There you go.  There's only one that gives you a rod each time,  and this one doesn't do that, so I don't think you do your job.  In this guy's defense, he sounds like a very exciting guy  that probably means a lot more effort.  Let me tell you, it just seems like your advice is shut up. 
[01:07:30]  Give me a break.  What do you find exciting, then?  I like the sexy stories.  All right, so you like their show, then?  You like that segment of their show?  That's not part of their show, though.  Well, oh, well.  Well, they do a different type of show.  What do you want to do, just whack your bag 24 hours a day on the station?  The guy didn't like ass-hair advice, and he's freaking out about it?  I want to know what he would like us to talk about.  Like, what's sexy to you?  Well, yeah.  Besides sexy stories, give us some of your key.  Well, it's kind of hard to be sexy on the radio, 
[01:08:00]  and sexy to me is, like, sexy stories.  Give us some of your past stories of...  Why don't you give one she's saying?  Why don't you say something that you think is sexy  so she'll have an idea of what it is that you're looking for?  Yeah, what do you find sexy?  I like to hear what she's done with her boyfriends in the past.  How about you say something?  What do you'd like to do with...  Go ahead.  Give the girls a sexy story, sir.  A real one.  Uh, well, I'm a 19-year-old boy,  and a couple years ago, I was with this girl,  and her parents really didn't like me, 
[01:08:30]  so I'd take her to the woods and do things with her,  do oral favors, and, uh...  How many years younger than you is she?  Uh, three.  All right.  Are you wanking off right now?  No.  Sounds like it.  He's out of breath.  See, I think you're weird.  Like, you're actually jacking off with Opie and Anthony,  and you don't like our show.  That's why he doesn't like us.  All right.  I think he's gay.  I want to hear his erotic story about last prom night.  Well, I was home alone, whacking off...  All right, Dan, you don't like this show. 
[01:09:00]  Don't laugh about that.  Come on.  I know you were doing it.  Thank you, Dan.  Believe me, I know I'm a zero.  I just don't criticize hot chicks  because I didn't give the advice I wanted them to give.  I was in the woods with a girl,  and I hit her in the head with a shovel  and buried the body in a shallow grave.  Who's more exciting, Dan from Wisconsin  or Super Agent Bob Eatman?  Oh, I think that is Super Agent Bob Eatman.  That's my favorite.  I don't like your show.  You need new representation.  He's mad because you wouldn't tell him  how to dig easier in January  when the ground is frozen.  All right, Dan, thank you. 
[01:09:30]  All right, bye.  Bye, fella.  Well, that's a bad way to meet each other.  I'm sorry, girls.  Well, it's okay.  We like critique.  We like to hear all, you know?  Absolutely.  Give it to us.  Of course.  That's Jim Norton,  and his friend Jim Florentine  thinks you guys have the best show  on XM Satellite Radio.  He'll go from one extreme to the other.  He does whack his bag when he's going from gig to gig  because he's a comedian,  and he's driving all over the East Coast,  and he turns you guys on,  and he has Kleenex right on the dashboard, right? 
[01:10:00]  You ever listen to Crank?  You ever see Crank Yankers on Comedy Central?  Yes.  The retarded puppet special ed?  Yay!  He whacks off listening to you.  All right.  That is so cool.  That is so cool.  I love that.  I'm honored.  Tell him I'm honored.  Truly.  Very cool.  Truly.  Did you guys like your signing  that you were doing before?  Always.  Sure.  I mean, an hour.  Why are you laughing?  Why are you laughing?  Be honest.  No, see.  They're a little creepy looking.  They're not here anymore.  You can talk about them.  You have never signed over on the adult side.  That's creepy.  They're all kind of sweaty and drooling. 
[01:10:30]  Ew.  Yeah.  So they're very well behaved over here.  So that was a treat for you guys?  Absolutely.  Yeah, this was lovely.  This is easy.  Nice clean suits.  Not like aftershave.  Today, later, is the ugly side.  They look like a Megan's Law photo op.  That's the worst group of people I've ever seen in my life.  Yeah, really, the adult side is a little sleazy.  Have you guys checked it out at all?  Oh, yeah.  Well, Jimmy has.  Yeah.  We're going to head over there.  Take a look.  I mean, you've got to go today, I hear.  Yeah.  It's the insanity.  Today's the day? 
[01:11:00]  Yeah.  Today and tomorrow will be insane.  We're doing a show from there tomorrow.  Oh, you'll see.  I think you guys are broadcasting, right?  Yeah.  Today from 2 to 5.  Okay, and then tomorrow we're taking over your spot, I guess.  Yeah, there you go.  Or whatever.  We're in a couple hours.  How's it hooked up?  Where are you?  A lot of traffic there?  A lot of fun people passing by?  Right on the walkway.  No, by the time, when you guys are there, it's like shoulder to shoulder.  Really?  It'll be so crazy.  You can't even get through it from where you guys are to the front entrance might take  you about an hour just to get through the crowd.  Oh, my God.  Seriously.  How exciting, huh?  Yeah, it's pretty cool. 
[01:11:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Nice.  And this is quite the setup here.  Yeah.  Nice and peaceful.  You kind of have to scream over there.  You do?  Yeah.  Can't hear.  How long of a show are we doing?  Only two hours, I think, right?  Two hours.  Just two hours.  Yeah.  Pretty good.  Another two-hour throwaway.  Yeah.  We're just doing throwaway shows.  The visual is really nice.  There's a TV screen directly across from where you guys will be that's showing vintage porn.  Vintage porn.  Yeah, vintage porn.  Oh, really?  Nice.  Vintage.  Oh, lots of big, thick.  Yeah.  Vintage porn mustache.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Full effect.  The pork chop sideburns. 
[01:12:00]  Yeah.  So it's a nice visual right across from where you are.  Is it true you were the first one to do anal?  Ever?  Contract?  Ever.  Wow, you're cool.  I invented it, yeah.  You get a nickel every time there's a prison rape on that?  First one contracted to do anal on film or something like that?  I invented that, Robin.  Yeah, she was that girl.  Yeah, I was one of the first, you know, A talent to do it.  How does someone come up to you and go, well, look, this is what we want you to do? 
[01:12:30]  Just like that.  Really?  Yeah.  And what was your first reaction?  Ouch.  Because now it's, you know, it's in every film, but back then you've got to think,  whoa, this is a little freaky.  Back when?  Yeah.  How long ago was that?  Oh, gosh.  Ten years.  Two, ten years ago.  What was your whole name in the film?  I didn't know.  Excuse me?  What was your name?  You're celebrating its 10th anniversary.  Oh, I am so.  Yeah, Ashton.  Devil and Miss Jones.  Happy birthday, anal.  Happy birthday, anal.  You're the devil and Miss Jones.  Blow this out.  Yeah, yeah.  So, I like it in my private life, so I didn't mind. 
[01:13:00]  What about, we had a girl yesterday.  This was interesting.  Yeah, hello.  She's like 22.  She's been in the business seven months.  She's done 220 films.  She's worked every day.  Every single day.  Sometimes twice.  All anal.  Wow.  You should see her.  You guys should see how she stands.  It's so scary.  She can't even stand up.  Oh, my God.  Like, she's like pygmy body.  Yeah, yeah.  She's like arched all weird and like, it's kind of crazy.  What does she do in the off season?  Smuggle bales of marijuana? 
[01:13:30]  She's a mule every day.  Every day.  Okay.  So, her and her boyfriend only do vaginal.  Because that's more intimate.  It's more intimate to her.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You got to save something for the boyfriend, right?  Exactly.  Something for the boyfriend.  Something.  Who was the guy your scene was with when you did it?  Do you remember?  The first anal scene.  Contracted.  No, I don't know.  I don't know.  Ten years ago.  Come on, man.  Who were you banging ten years ago?  Probably the same person I am now.  Me.  Hey, do you know Paul Thomas? 
[01:14:00]  Sure.  I want to get him on the air someday.  He's like a legendary.  Who's Paul Thomas?  He's a legendary porn guy.  He's been around for 25 years.  Vivid director.  He's a great director.  And he's actually was a very fine actor.  But he's actually stopped saying great director.  No, because in that time.  No, the time that he came up is when there was a big strike in Hollywood.  It was an actor's strike.  So a lot of really good actors, including Paul Thomas, moved over to adult because they couldn't get work.  Jamie Gillis can act too. 
[01:14:30]  Jamie Gillis, Randy Spears were mainstream actors.  And then during the strike, that's when they decided to start doing adult because they had to pay their bills.  Well, Paul Thomas is notoriously one of the biggest perverts.  And you wouldn't know it from his movies, but off camera, he's notoriously one of the biggest.  How did you find that out, fella?  Other people.  Well, you notice I walked in with a limp.  No, he was not.  He's actually just, you know, I know people that know him.  And they said that he's the biggest freak in the entire business.  He's in Jesus Christ Superstar, the movie.  Is he really?  Yeah.  Cool.  Wow. 
[01:15:00]  How about that?  That's a little bit of trivia.  Kind of a real credit.  Jim knows all of them.  I mean, he was showing me his pictures yesterday.  He's like, this is Buttman.  And he revolutionized the whole business.  With the camera work, he did.  He was kind of pointing the camera work.  He was fantastic.  I just watched the films and enjoyed them.  I know.  I don't know.  It's pretty much watch until you finish.  I don't know what's going on behind the scenes.  Watch until you do your money shot.  And then...  I watch 10 minutes at a time.  Click.  That's what people do.  So, George Wallace is here.  Thanks, Ben.  Oh, cool.  Went for a walk.  He'll be back in 10 minutes.  Thank you.  What's the hot thing to do in porn now? 
[01:15:30]  I mean, back 10 years ago, the anal thing was starting up.  Well, now, you know, you've got to be...  It's more and more.  Freak show.  Yeah, exactly.  It's a double freak show.  Anal.  Hello?  Double anal.  Excuse me?  Oh, right, right.  I like pink eye videos, you know, where the guy blows his load in their eyeballs.  They hold the girl's eyelids open.  That's a nice one, yeah.  That's hot right now?  Are you kidding me?  No.  That's the truth.  It seems to be a little pain.  Okay, the swallowing goldfish and then, like, six loads of cum and then you throw it up 
[01:16:00]  and then eat it again.  These are the hot things today.  Yeah.  I know you're getting turned on just thinking about it, aren't you?  That's great.  Why is it going to the freak show route?  Why?  Julie, I'll let you ask that.  Is it because there's so much out there?  I think the extreme, like, reality show thing is kind of filtered into the adult world.  Everything.  TV is extreme.  Everything.  Life is becoming extreme.  You've got to keep pushing or else you're going to get ignored.  So, you know.  There's nothing sexy.  And, like, I'm a pervert.  Absolutely not. 
[01:16:30]  But gold, I feel like the degradation.  I mean, look, I've been used as a toilet.  What fella hasn't?  Eat goldfish and throw them up?  I mean, it's...  Right.  Well, with jizz.  With the load.  Oh, okay.  I stand corrected.  That makes it hot.  Hey, what about pregnancy videos?  Those are big.  Those are big right now, too.  Like, pregnant women, lactating.  Oh, nice.  Yeah.  Nothing.  Do you think that's sexy?  There's something for everybody.  No, I said Thomas used to do that.  When she first got the...  Oh, really?  Yeah.  We go way back with Sunset Thomas.  No, I mean, to see a pregnant woman is kind of a turn-on.  But the whole lactating thing and all that? 
[01:17:00]  Nah.  Yeah.  No, not at all.  You do like the prego videos, though.  He has a little bit of the...  No, no, no.  Yeah?  No, it's not about, you know, watching them bang.  No.  Just seeing a pregnant woman on the street is sexy to me.  You mean on the street or walking?  Walking.  Walking in the street?  Under a delivery truck.  It was Scott Peterson.  Jim's into...  In a rowboat.  Jim's into the golden showers and even worse.  No, no worse.  Scat?  No, no, no.  If it slips out, he's a scatterer.  Oh, really?  He's into the scat. 
[01:17:30]  No, no, I'm not.  If it happens, I just don't want to embarrass her by saying anything.  Have you had it happen?  We had a girl that pooped on our show.  Really?  Yeah, when she was squirting.  In studio.  In studio.  We had to throw the chair away.  Why'd she...  On the chair?  Yeah.  What, did she sneeze?  She squit.  She squit.  She was squirting and shit at the same time.  Squit?  Anthony squit.  Didn't know it had a word, everybody.  She squit.  Now you learn, so it's educational programming today.  She's a squitter.  Wow.  It's making our cherry dart thing seem pretty low-key.  Yeah.  She's like...  We're going to have to do a radio show with you guys. 
[01:18:00]  Yeah.  We're going to have to combine the two shows for a day.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  Just for a day.  He lays down plastic and everything.  Yeah, sometimes.  Really?  Full GS.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So you're into it.  Sure.  Do you have a regular pisser?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  You do?  Regular.  See, Julie, that's...  Are you into that?  What?  I like peeing in the shower.  No, no.  No, I don't use the shower.  You like it all over the place.  No, just on me.  Oh, how about the polar bear?  This is a good one.  She goes out and she lives up in the, you know, super cold.  Stands outside until she can barely take it anymore. 
[01:18:30]  She's so frozen.  She comes in, lays in the bathtub, and he pees on her, and the steam coming up gets her off.  You've got to try that.  That sounds like you.  No, that's weird.  That's her king.  What the hell is going on?  I don't like any fetish.  I can only satisfy six months out of your year in Alaska.  There's no reason.  I thought she was going to necrophilia round.  Yeah, that's what I thought.  No, no.  I was getting scared.  No, no.  It had a nice ending, eh?  It's not bad for us.  Come on.  It had a nice ending there, right?  The steam must just smell like a subway. 
[01:19:00]  So are you into the squirters?  I've only had one in my life that was real.  That was real?  Yeah.  Like I knew that's what she did, yes.  This girl, can we say who it is?  Cytheria?  Yeah, yeah.  I just got a video.  Oops.  Yeah, she's a squirter.  Yes, she is.  Big time.  Jimmy knows all the names.  Oh, I just picked up the video.  Yo, she sent me one.  He wrote Cytheria on the thing, because I'm into that.  She'll be there today.  It hit the entire wall.  Yeah.  Got all over the equipment.  In our studio.  Like the glass on the control booth. 
[01:19:30]  Our boss right now is looking on, very proud of us.  No, boss.  My God.  We keep it G-rated for everybody.  No problem.  He said PG-rated.  PG.  We haven't heard any bad words.  Oh, yeah.  We haven't cursed.  No, of course not.  Kevin Kennedy's on.  We talk baseball.  And then the people who go around, we talk about sex.  Yeah, that's what we do on this program.  And then you've got George Wallace.  And then George Wallace will bring in the funny.  Yes.  He'll be back.  It's all good.  And what's up with the drill dough thing?  We had a girl do the drill dough on our show.  Oh, the fuck machine you did.  See, watch the words, T.  What?  What do you mean watch the words? 
[01:20:00]  Oh, we're not allowed to say them?  You can say whatever you want.  Oh, I'm so used to XM.  Okay, sorry.  No, we are XM.  Okay, yeah.  Technically, but because we're in a live audience today.  Sorry, everybody, cover your ears out there.  There are certain people that think we should probably keep the language.  Okay, so the drill dough machine.  She needed that.  Yeah, yeah, we had that in the studio.  You like it?  It's not very intimate.  You know, there's no hugging, kissing.  It's just true.  We had this audio of one of our listeners doing the drill dough to his girlfriend.  And we play it a lot. 
[01:20:30]  She was screaming like she was being able to just hack the pieces.  So then our listeners decided to start making more, like, drill dough-type instruments.  Tell them about the one that went hard to roll.  Oh, the latest one we got was a Sawzall, which is a reciprocating saw.  We had that on Playboy TV.  You did?  Yeah.  We didn't have our version.  But not our version, because this guy made it at home.  And he took a dildo and glued it on a Sawzall blade.  Now, if you've ever seen a reciprocating saw, it's pretty much just this handheld device  with a saw blade that goes back and forth and sticks out of the front of it.  Yeah. 
[01:21:00]  You could cut anything with it.  Yeah.  He just put the dildo on the saw blade and glued it there.  So as he's using it, thank God, not on a woman.  He's just kind of doing it in the air.  It came off.  The blade came flying right out of the side of the dildo.  No.  Awful.  And we're just thinking, boy, that would have looked great in the newspaper.  Opie and Anthony, once again, now they killed somebody with a dildo device.  Yeah.  So we don't use that one.  Yeah.  Watch out for homing sex toys.  You heard what happened to us, right?  Yeah.  The sex at St. Pat's?  Yeah.  You're bad boys.  We know this about you. 
[01:21:30]  Yeah.  You're bad.  That's why you're here now on SM.  It's good, though.  So evil.  It's good for all of us.  Beautiful.  We love it.  Good for all of us.  So we know now your background with the anal thing.  Yeah.  But what's your background and expertise?  You're not a porn star, right?  No.  I'm just a big mouth.  I'm really not an expert.  I'm just a chick with an opinion.  She's like in this gray area, you know?  Yeah, I'm in the gray area.  I'm right on the cliff of everything.  She shows stuff.  Yeah.  I'm a playboy girl.  Oh, nice.  But I don't, you know, I don't take it up the ass or anything.  Boobs.  I'm boobs, you know. 
[01:22:00]  Yeah.  I'm that chick.  Boobs ass, right?  And you give advice to people that call?  I give advice.  Well, as myself, like, you know, here's how I feel about it.  Yeah.  And I'm not judging you.  It's just my opinion that you're a pig.  And I'm totally surprised that he doesn't like it.  I do that a lot.  I'm surprised that guy doesn't like it because we give such man advice.  We're really like, you know what, guys?  If you want sex, take it.  Right.  You know, not from, like, the girl down the street.  I know, I didn't mean it that way.  You want sex, just take it.  I'm just saying, like, if you're in a relationship.  Well, there's a lot of guys out there that want sex, so. 
[01:22:30]  That's great.  If candy doesn't work, buy a hammer.  Yeah.  I'm saying in a relationship, you know.  You've been married for eight years and she's not putting out.  Come on.  She's your wife.  She owes you.  You bet she does.  It's her job.  Yeah, it is.  You know?  You can always take her fishing later.  You have to take control of the situation.  We like that.  We actually like that.  And you've heard it all with this show of yours, huh?  Yeah.  What was the craziest thing you heard that some guy was into?  Oh, Ted likes to put Q-tips in his wiener. 
[01:23:00]  All right.  Oh, the bone.  With mentholatum.  With mentholatum as lube.  As lube.  That's right.  He calls in with that going on.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  I can't even do that.  Don't knock it until you try it, man.  What do you do while that's happening?  Just cry and go, I'm sorry, mommy.  That really is childhood psychosis coming out.  He does it live on your show?  Yeah.  Yeah, he does it.  Can we steal that one?  Sure.  We have to steal that one.  Yeah, that's a good one.  I could not even be in the same building where that was going on without losing my money. 
[01:23:30]  Hey, we got a MiFi to give away, everybody.  The first caller, isn't it?  But instead of mentholatum, you got to use gasoline.  Oh, fuck.  Wow, that's pretty crazy.  Yeah, that's true.  Yeah, that is.  You know, other people want us to ride, you know, he wants to ride his mother like a horse  while we spank her and yell giddy up.  That's a little issue.  And the guy's dead serious.  He's not just calling to goof around.  Dead serious.  Yeah.  To goof around?  Because we get the goof callers now.  Oh, yeah.  We get to get, but they're pretty real.  It's frightening that they're real. 
[01:24:00]  What does his mother look like?  Good question.  Is she hot?  Like a hot milf?  It's radio.  We don't know.  Oh, she never seen it.  Okay.  I doubt it.  Based on his voice, I don't know.  It's just, you know.  That's kind of creepy.  Yeah.  We've had milfs on the show a lot.  A lot of that.  And a lot of guys just whack them when they talk to you.  The mayonnaise in a sock.  Mayonnaise in a sock is a great, you know, if your hand gets tired, try that.  Mayonnaise in a sock.  Mayonnaise in a tube sock.  Mayonnaise in a sock.  I thought there was a David Krusty date.  I've never heard of that one. 
[01:24:30]  It's like the homemade vag, right?  Mm-hmm.  Exactly.  What else can we use?  Quick and easy.  We get a peanut butter a lot, but don't use chunky.  Use the smooth peanut butter.  Of course not.  What do you do with the peanut butter?  On your hands, or?  Yeah, and then you masturbate with it.  Ugh.  I don't know.  We hear a little bit of you guys that like that.  Fred Durst, didn't he tell us about the cantaloupe?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, you microwave it, but don't microwave it for too long.  Right, right.  It'll burn, but you've got to get it just warm.  You nuke it so it gets warm, and then you put like a hole in it. 
[01:25:00]  We're giving everyone a lot of ideas today.  If you're standing there with a cantaloupe on there, you just better not be a mirror nearby,  because if you get a gander at you doing that, you'd probably shoot yourself in the head.  That'd be a perfect time for a heart attack, you know?  Oh, please.  I think mom has to find you.  Find you at home with a cantaloupe on there.  Just wonder.  Because, you know, it's not like you're steadily dating, and you're getting a lot of action,  and one night you're not getting any, and you decide to go for the cantaloupe.  That's just months of not getting any action. 
[01:25:30]  It's sad.  That you look at the cantaloupe and go, yeah.  That looks pretty good.  That's a sexy cantaloupe.  I like it.  And your mother calls and said, the juice man says that if you could replace a cantaloupe with a citrus.  Now, you've done a carrot.  Oh, we've got to play that going into break.  Well, girls using fruits or vegetables is different than a guy using it.  So true.  It's kind of a more accurate representation.  Right.  And also, it's very accepted for girls to use toys and devices.  And I've heard a comic do this. 
[01:26:00]  Who the hell does that bit?  But girls can use the dildo devices, and it's perfectly acceptable.  But a guy has to use these weird things that's just like a chunk of an ass made of rubber.  Julie has one of those.  Hey, it's, you know.  I have one.  She has.  Really?  It's the Julie ass.  Or just a cut out private area like you hacked it off of somebody.  She's got her ass in one of those boxes.  Oh, wow.  Really?  Yeah.  Your ass was used as a model for that?  Yeah.  Nice.  Do you remember, we had one on our TV show that was like this rubber thing, 
[01:26:30]  and it looked like a Cornish hen.  It looked like a Cornish hen hen.  For real.  So people, yeah, will just stick their thing in there.  But that's men for you.  I mean, whatever.  It doesn't take much.  They'll put it in there.  It doesn't.  You have to sign your own butt when these guys come walking up to you.  They walk up to you.  It's kind of heavy.  It's really heavy.  So they don't really carry it with them.  That's creepy, man.  We had one of those at the studio, and we'd slap it down on the table  and just make some vulgar sound.  That awful noise.  That rubber hitting the table, knowing it's ready for action.  It's ready.  You could smack it and lube it up with the KY. 
[01:27:00]  Yep.  And then who's washing those things out?  It just doesn't seem like something.  You've got to throw all that in the dishwasher after you're done.  That's the problem.  Once you're finished, you're really not into anything afterwards,  like cleaning up, because it just adds to the degradation.  We've talked about that on our show.  When you're with somebody and you're doing some of this freaky stuff,  it sounds like a good idea at the time,  but then as soon as everyone's done, you're looking around like,  oh, God, this is kind of embarrassing.  Who hasn't been drunk with their chick at some point  and decided, you know, let's get the razor out and shave each other. 
[01:27:30]  And it sounds like a great idea, and there's oil involved and shaving going on.  And then you get done, and you're like, oh, God, I've got to go to work.  What if I have an accident?  What if I've got to go to the hospital?  And then a couple of days, you're like, oh, like you've got the mange.  Absolutely.  And it just turns into a really bad idea.  Well, you realize you messed up and shamed her head.  Now she looks like she has cancer.  So he has to go there.  Sicko.  I'm sorry.  Sicko, you are.  Big.  Yeah.  Well, he doesn't grow hair on his arms. 
[01:28:00]  Look at that.  His arms are so fine and hairless.  Touch it.  It's like nothing.  What ethnicity are you?  What's that?  What hairless ethnicity are you?  I'm Irish.  Irish with no hair.  Feel how wispy that hair is on his arm.  Do you have hair down there?  You're so dainty.  That's dainty.  For you listening at home, this is so stupid.  Enjoy it.  I love that one.  The toy suit fall.  Yummy.  That is hilarious.  It scared me.  He does scare you. 
[01:28:30]  Yes, he does.  Yes, yes.  Whether he's doing that or not.  All right.  Well, we've got to take a break.  It's been great.  We've got to have you guys on the show.  Thank you.  Right as bad.  If you guys are in L.A., we broadcast from Corn Valley.  So we kind of have the edge on you guys.  Or you can bring us up where you're from.  No, screw it.  We're going to Corn Valley.  Corn Valley.  Can we do that Monday?  Let's trade off.  Can we go Monday?  Is that on the nav systems of the new vehicles?  Yes, absolutely.  You're just punching Corn Valley and it takes you right there?  I don't even know where that is.  Dude, we've got to broadcast from Corn Valley.  Where is Corn Valley?  Woodland Hills.  Woodland Hills.  Right around there? 
[01:29:00]  Chatsworth.  Near Silicon Valley?  Yeah.  Jimmy knows.  Very appropriate, isn't it?  It's right below.  Corn Valley is right below Silicon Valley.  Yeah, so come visit us.  Right by Vag Village, who's off to the side and you make a left.  Oh, we can keep going on that.  That's good.  Of course.  You guys are great.  Down across Wiener Way.  Wiener Way.  It's Julie and Tiffany, you guys.  Let's hear it for Julie and Tiffany.  Thank you very much.  Short drive up the Hershey Highway.  That old gag.  You know, I think as we go to break, Norton talks about his exploits with the prostitutes, 
[01:29:30]  okay?  Excellent.  Yeah.  He's very honest and open about it, but the problem is his mom listens to the show.  Oh.  Hi, Mom.  And so his mom left this message on his answer machine at home.  Yeah, a real message.  A real message.  A real message.  Trying to give little Jimmy Norton some advice.  So we'll check this out.  And when we come back, it's George Wallace, everyone.  Hi, sweetheart.  It's Mom.  How are you?  Jimmy, I know this is a little awkward, but everyone's fine here, but we heard the radio  show. 
[01:30:00]  We love it, by the way.  And you were talking about giving up, you know, ladies of the evening, which is a wonderful  thing.  But you know what?  Dr. Phil always says replace something with something.  So I was thinking, you know, you have that nice gym downstairs.  And, you know, just for like 20 minutes to half an hour and you would feel better.  Use that.  And also there's gyms in New York.  You could go.  You could exercise.  And you would feel a whole lot better.  You'd lose a little weight. 
[01:30:30]  You'd tone up.  And you relieve, you know, tension and stuff.  And you'd be meeting other people.  I don't know, honey.  I just thought it might be a good thing.  I'm sorry.  I'm interfering.  I know.  I just am thinking of you.  Nobody knows I'm calling.  So don't get offended or think I'm strange.  But I am a mother.  And I worry about you.  You're doing so well.  Everything is falling into place.  This might be just one of the, you know, the health thing.  It would help you, sweetheart.  Well, anyway, that's it.  I'm not going to go on and on.  I know it's not my business.  But, anyway, I love you. 
[01:31:00]  And I feel I can interfere because I'm your mother.  I'm taking a special license.  But, anyway, we're looking forward to seeing you at Christmas.  I really hope you can make it.  And, anyway, don't be mad at me, okay, sweetie?  I love you.  Talk to you soon.  Bye-bye.  And I'm living welcome to Las Vegas.  Live from Las Vegas.  What a hot voice that is.

And we're back with the Opie and Anthony program. 
[01:34:00]  Broadcasting live from the CES.  Tomorrow broadcasting live from the porn convention, Anthony.  The girls from Playboy were great, weren't they?  Yeah, it was very cool.  Yeah, we're doing the tech thing today, George, and then tomorrow it's all about the porn stars.  Yeah, why are you bringing me here with cars?  I want to be with the porn industry.  Who doesn't?  Yeah, right?  Enough with the cars, right?  Right.  What can you do in a car?  What can you do with a car?  Bring on the bitches.  Talk to me, somebody.  Hey, welcome back, guys.  Welcome.  It's good to see you.  George Wallace used to do our program when we were on regular radio, right?  In New York City. 
[01:34:30]  Yeah, look at you guys.  God bless you.  Let's give him a big hug.  Oh, thank you.  Good to be here.  Thank you.  Yeah, we had a little problem.  I don't know whether God's going to bless you two or not.  But it's okay.  You ought to be Satan bless us or something.  I would have done the same thing.  That's all I'm going to say, okay?  There you go.  You wouldn't be open to Anthony if you didn't do what you did.  It was a misunderstanding.  Totally, totally.  And, you know, speaking of controversy, your nephew caused a bit of controversy.  Well, you know.  That's one of the greatest sports video of all time.  You understand that, right?  And I have to tell everybody in my audience. 
[01:35:00]  That's related to Ben Wallace.  It pretty much started the fight.  Your nephew?  Every night at Flamingo, before my show starts, I have to tell everybody in the audience.  If anybody throw a cup of them on that stage, I'm coming out there and kick your ass, okay?  I'm kicking your ass in a person.  Matter of fact, oh, hi.  How you guys doing out there?  I wanted to kick somebody's ass out here, but they look tough.  He comes from a sports family.  I only know of Ben Wallace, but there's a couple more that have...  How about Steve Wallace?  Played for the 49ers for 13 years.  Steve Wallace.  That's my nephew.  Three Super Bowl rings, okay?  A money to my plan right now.  That's my nephew.  He plays for the New York Giants. 
[01:35:30]  Number 81.  You know that, don't you?  Hell yeah.  Bobby Hamilton, who's playing for the Oakland Raiders right now, he played for the New England  Patriots for two years.  So we got six Super Bowl rings in my family.  Can you believe that?  That's a blessing, isn't it, Jim?  Wow.  Why are you looking at me with your mouth open?  Nah, he's impressed.  There's certain things I'm good at.  I didn't know you were late to that one.  Maybe we don't need to go to the Porn Convention.  He said certain things he's good with his mouth open.  Now, let me ask you a question.  Yeah, so we got six Super Bowl rings in the family.  That's a big blessing, don't you think so?  That's pretty impressive, Jim.  I have to think about that sometime.  Hey, a lot of guys play football all their life and never get one. 
[01:36:00]  And we have six in the family.  It's pretty nice.  That's damn impressive.  Yeah, so you guys got the New York Post here today?  Well, the big story today, I don't even know how we're going to get to it.  What is this?  It's Michael Jackson.  I don't know what that is.  That is a freak of nature.  You know when I'm president of these United States, you know what I'm going to do, don't  you?  I'm going to lock up everybody to drop the kids off at Michael Jackson House.  First of all, why would you drop your kids off at this man's house?  They're still dropping them off.  Listen, this man's almost 50 years old and still climbing trees in high-heeled shoes.  You're going to drop your kids off over there? 
[01:36:30]  You know, he has a reputation.  What are you guys?  He already had to pay one kid, what, $21, $22 million?  Yeah.  I don't know whether he was guilty or not.  All I know is I wish it had been my son.  $22 million.  Get in that room, boy.  Now, that's the only reason I can think of it.  You don't want to go?  I'll go.  When I move, you move.  You know what I'm saying?  Stop being selfish.  That's the only reason I can see of dropping your kids off there is if you want to capitalize  on it.  But I think this was the motive of this lady there finding out.  I don't know what's in the paper today.  I don't know where is the story. 
[01:37:00]  Oh, some ugly allegations coming out of there.  This is the New York Post, right?  And you know I live in New York Post.  Let's go to page 6.  You know, one thing about New York Post, page 6 could be on page 11, page 13.  It's all different in New York.  Very odd, isn't it?  Well, we don't count well in New York, so it doesn't matter.  And a lot of things are different in New York.  Central Park, it's not central.  It's on the west side.  Did you know that?  Anything on the right side of Fifth Avenue is on the west side.  There's a lot of things, you know?  All right.  Madison Square Garden, there's no garden.  And it's not square, it's round. 
[01:37:30]  You want to know something better?  And it's not on Madison either.  We could go tell you.  I could tell you a lot of things about that.  That is true.  You know, yeah.  Well, last time I saw you perform, I went to the decor dinner with Laura Bush.  Really?  Posted, and that was one of the...  Oh, you were there with me and Ms. Bush?  One of the toughest audiences you can do.  It's a very political thing.  Of course, political.  Black Republicans.  Black Republicans.  Yeah, Roy Ennis, very conservative.  You know I felt out of place with black Republicans.  Who are the other two guys?  You know I'm only going to kick your ass one time. 
[01:38:00]  You know that, don't you?  And you know he could fight.  Of course.  Look at his nephew.  His nephew, it's not like I threw a cup at him.  Who are the other two guys?  That's a great joke.  That's a good joke.  There was a whole lot of them there.  So tell us, please.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And we had a good time at that Republican convention.  I think Laura Bush was scared to go on after you.  She was like, I've got to follow George Wallace.  That was the first thing she said when she walked up, which was nice.  Wow.  We had a good time.  What are they saying about Michael Jackson?  Can we get into this a little bit?  Well, thesmokinggun.com.  You've been on that website.  They post a lot of these court records and documents. 
[01:38:30]  And they kind of got a hold of what the prosecution has come up with and all these search warrants that have happened at Neverland and what they've collected.  And some of the stuff is creepy, but I don't think it's surprising.  In his bathroom, Michael Jackson's bathroom.  What?  They found a Samsonite briefcase containing porno magazines, a barely legal magazine, a club magazine. 
[01:39:00]  Hell, he stole my briefcase.  This is Martini Steve's apartment.  You're right.  I know, yeah.  But this isn't like, I think anyone's got some porno at their house, right?  Yeah, everybody.  You all got porno at your house, right?  Barely legal DVD.  They're not here for the curse show.  Let me tell you, they're not here for electronics.  They're here for the porn convention.  They want to hear a couple curses.  Three books with pictures of nude men in them were found in Jackson's bathroom with an open bottle of Jack Daniels and Pinot Noir. 
[01:39:30]  So I think, now Jack Daniels, I can understand having that.  But if you're Michael Jackson in every room in the house, because the second a kid starts going, hey, wait a minute.  I don't think I should cocktail time.  Hey, Michael, I'm starting to feel a little creepy about drink.  Drink?  Drink my liquor and talk to me.  It doesn't matter where he is.  Right?  You can have him in a closet.  It's like, no, Michael, I don't feel comfortable.  Cocktail? 
[01:40:00]  Michael, your nose looks like tracing paper.  Oh, man.  Maybe you could use this.  Well, welcome to Las Vegas, you guys.  I know you're here for the show, for the electronic show and the porno convention.  And the porno.  You're just here for the porno.  Let's face it.  Let's say that's what the XM stands for.  Yeah, believe me, if we didn't have to broadcast from here, I don't think we'd be hanging here as long as we have.  Well, you've got a great show.  You've got a great audience.  Man, you've got a guy backstage that's coming on.  I know I've got to get out of here, but this is great.  One of my favorite baseball players of all time.  I hope he's here for you guys, because I'm talking about him. 
[01:40:30]  Oh, I hope he's, huh?  You know I'm from Atlanta.  Not here for us.  He's not here for you guys?  No, so you better just stay in that seat.  He's not here for you guys?  Yeah.  We don't want you to go anywhere.  No.  I saw Greg Mannix in the back.  He's not here for you guys?  Yes, you did.  Dude, they keep the classier guys for all the other shows.  Well, what do you mean?  Wait a minute.  What do you mean, Opie?  What do you mean by that?  I'll bust a cap in your ass for talking to me like that.  You know that?  It's not wrong.  The other shows get the athletes.  We get the relatives.  Well, how about that?  No, you're real smart here, aren't you, Jim?  Yeah, we'll talk to his uncle, too, next break. 
[01:41:00]  Well, he can go to hell, then, if he can't be on this show.  He's doing the show after.  It's a sports show right after.  George, Cal Ripken was walking around.  He, you know, we couldn't get him on the show.  He was right here.  Don't they know who opened in?  They don't know who you are.  That's why they don't put him on.  That they know exactly who we are.  They don't know what's going to happen, right?  Cal Ripken, man.  You know, big guy yesterday, a total sports legend, but, you know, I think he's a pretty  conservative guy, and I don't think our forum is quite for him. 
[01:41:30]  You guys are not that far out, man.  Come on, you're not that far out.  You just have a good time, and that's the kind of radio I like.  If you're not controversial, there's no reason to be a radio.  We just kind of screw up every three years, that's all.  Yeah, every three years, we screw up, and the reputation that follows us because of our  screw-ups keeps certain guests off our show.  But look how good that is.  You screw up every three years, you get a two-year vacation.  You can't beat that kid.  That is kind of nice.  We've been doing radio together ten years.  Right.  As long as they've been doing anal and adult video, we learned that today.  And we didn't have to do anal. 
[01:42:00]  But only seven and a half years on the air.  We've had to take two and a half years off from our career since we've been together.  What did you do those two years off?  Were you going around just holidaying?  Sitting around.  Kind of just counting the days off, like prisoners.  I was wondering about you guys, because when you went off, you know, I was your competitor  in New York City, so.  You were on the radio in New York?  Yeah, I wasn't.  He didn't know that.  No, you came on in the afternoon, and I was on in the morning.  I was very good.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I hope he gives him a little underhanded jab there. 
[01:42:30]  You were on the air?  I never heard of that.  Wow.  Man, I would have listened to that.  I had no idea.  He's going to kill me.  What station were you on?  Because I remember hearing it easier.  See, guys, thank you so much.  I was on Kiss FM, and I was on Kiss FM 98.7, Kiss FM.  That's the country station, right?  I was on, no.  Yeah, Wallace, Brooks, and Doug.  That was good.  And then I also did Jamming 105 at Clear Channel.  You know, your cheap channel. 
[01:43:00]  They fired me, too, so big deal.  They did?  I came in one morning, and they said, oh, you're not on.  That's how they do it.  Radio is terrible, isn't it?  Radio's the worst.  They throw you out.  You don't even know you're fired.  You're the last guy to know you're fired.  Oh, they didn't tell you guys why I'm here?  Oh, yeah.  That's usually how it's done.  It's true.  You don't know, well, what's he doing here, you know?  What did Frankie Blue get the boot?  Frankie Blue, yeah.  Frankie Blue over at WNW?  No, he came in after we got fired from NW.  But we had played his audio of his drunken tirade he had on the air a couple weeks back. 
[01:43:30]  He had thrown, he went to a Christmas party.  Got a little tipsy, walked in.  He's the program director over there, and he got into some fight with the girl that was supposed  to come on the air, and sent her home, and decided it was a good time for him to go on  the air and do the show.  Oh, my man.  And he was hammered.  So he slurred his words.  He actually said another station's call letters instead of the station he was on.  Really?  He probably did 10 and 105?  No, it was KTU. 
[01:44:00]  He said KTU because that was his other station.  That's right.  KTU, yeah.  And, well, we just heard today that the hammer out.  He got the hammer?  Yeah, he got fired.  Frankie Blue's gone?  Frankie Blue is gone.  What goes around comes around.  We were the ones that exploited that audio, though.  And now it's all over the country.  All the radio guys have a copy of it.  We were playing it on our show laughing our butts off.  O.P.  O.P. and Anthony does it again.  How about that?  There you have it.  Are you going back to radio?  I would like to go back to radio, but I'm having so much fun here in Los Angeles.  Because I came here last year, January, for 30 days and 60 days and 90 days. 
[01:44:30]  And I've been here, and I'm here at the Flamingo every night at 10 o'clock.  And it's one of the greatest things that's going to happen to me.  Every comedian in the world wants to get to Las Vegas.  And you can't get here.  You can't work here.  So there's only a few rooms open here.  And I'm here, and I'm having a good time.  You got, like, a steady gig every night.  Every night.  I work one hour a day.  How about that?  That's better than your job.  You guys work four hours a day.  Do you gamble?  No, we're working two hours a day.  Hell no, do I gamble?  You don't gamble?  No.  Why do you think they built this convention center?  You can't win here.  Let me give you some free advice. 
[01:45:00]  When you come to Las Vegas, you do what I do.  I get off the airplane.  I go straight to the casino cashier, and I give them all my money.  They don't need me.  Waste of my time.  Get that out of the way, right?  The only way you're going to double your money in Las Vegas is to mug somebody at the airport,  get your ass on that airplane, and go on back home.  And if you're going to gamble, gamble at Seasons Palace in the Bellagio.  Don't go down to Circus Circus.  You go down to Circus Circus, you're trying to roll the dice.  They've got monkeys and spit flying all over your head.  So you cannot win here.  I'm telling you, Jim, don't go down to...  Some people win.  You know, you might look out.  Well, that's what keeps people coming and keeps the hope that you're going to win something. 
[01:45:30]  You always hear about the person pulls that slot handle and then...  Wait a second.  Wait a second.  People come to Las Vegas to lose their money.  They know they're going to lose their money before they leave home.  I got $200 set aside.  I'm going to lose this.  That's true.  And it's all fun.  Let's make it clear.  You do have a good time while you're in Las Vegas, right?  Hell yeah.  I don't care whether you're losing your money or what.  You do have a good time.  And that's why you should keep coming here.  And come here to laugh.  Come here to have a good time.  We've got great comedians here.  You've got David Renner right here in Hoye Hilton.  You've got Rita Rudner.  I'm all about laughter.  So when you lose all your money, you come on down to the Flamingo. 
[01:46:00]  I'll make you laugh about it.  A little chuckle after you cry at the table.  So much stuff is in the news.  You can talk about it just every day.  Like the presidential...  What's her name?  George Bush, they're going to spend $30 million for a re-inauguration.  Now, why re-inaugurate this guy again?  $30 million?  Now, they can use that money somewhere else.  Don't you think so?  So I get pissed when things like that.  They can give that money to KFC so they can find the original recipe on that chicken again  or something like that.  There's other ways they can do it.  Because the chicken doesn't taste like it used to, does it?  No.  Somebody's not using all 11 spices. 
[01:46:30]  So when you come here, we can laugh about so many things that are happening in the news and  sports.  Like you've got sports today.  You've got Vijay Singh and Tiger Woods, right?  Yep.  Here's two guys, number one, number two guy in golf.  Two guys as dark as I am and neither one of them black.  That's a problem.  I can't figure it out.  So there's every day you can just read the newspaper and we can just talk about things  in the newspaper.  That's true.  Luttrell Sprewell.  Uh-huh.  Basketball guy.  What did he say the other day?  He cannot feed his family on $14.9 million.  Well, who the hell is your family, Luttrell? 
[01:47:00]  The whole country of Ethiopia?  I have something.  Hell, I can feed his family.  Oh, do you like good food?  Speaking of food, have you eaten here?  Oh, yeah.  We've got some restaurants here.  We've got Bradley Ogden's voted the number one restaurant.  We've got Cafe Barbariba.  But my favorite restaurant is Monta Miga B at Paris.  Make sure you stop there.  And I ate last night at Emerald's Place.  Y'all been to Emerald's Place?  I haven't been there yet either.  Oh, man, that food is so good.  He took it up a notch.  He took it up.  What's his hook?  What's Emerald's Hook?  I don't know.  Bam!  And I got my check last night.  I said, damn!  I don't think he took it up a couple of nights. 
[01:47:30]  Well, you don't come here for the prices, you know.  Well, that's true, too.  Everybody's got...  Well, you can eat here cheaply, so...  He eats BLTs every four hours, I believe.  Yeah, he's got upset stomach.  And then vomits them up all night.  I was vomiting all morning.  Jimmy, I was sick this morning.  What did you eat, man?  The food was that bad?  Three BLTs yesterday.  And there's, like, gourmet restaurants all over the place.  Yes, of course.  That you can go and get a really fine meal.  If you're going to eat, like, crap and not pay attention to your body and what you're putting in it,  that's fine.  But at least make it something good.  What does he do?  He gets his stack of bacon. 
[01:48:00]  You don't look any better than he does.  Now, what the hell are you eating?  At least I'm slender.  I'll say you are.  I wasn't vomiting last night.  No, and we tried to eat right last night, but all the restaurants closed at 1030.  No, that's what we had to do.  We did try.  We did try.  This has happened in Las Vegas.  Las Vegas has changed.  At 1050, 20 years ago, everything used to be open late.  Just like New York changed.  You can't even eat in New York now after 11 o'clock.  I don't know what happened, you know.  I don't know what happened, but it's different.  So you have to eat good food, young man.  That really hurt.  At least I'm slender.  Oh, and you're admitting that what? 
[01:48:30]  You're slender?  He's not fat.  The other day, you pulled your shirt up to me.  You grabbed your belly, looked me in the eye, and went, ugh.  I did do that.  What does that mean?  Do it now.  Look at my washboard abs.  We can see it on XM Radio.  Do it right now.  If you want to see what my stomach looks like, watch Boogie Nights, and when Philip Seymour  Hoffman is crying in his half-shirt, that's what I look like without his shirt.  There's no way I'm lifting up my shirt and showing my fat stomach.  Well, we already see the crack of your ass from the back.  You might as well show your stomach.  It really is bad. 
[01:49:00]  And I don't know which one of them looks worse.  Well, the other thing about Jimmy, you notice he has no hair on his arms?  No, nothing.  There's no hair.  It's so wispy.  I don't either.  I don't either.  But touch his.  Look, feel his hair.  It's so wispy.  You know, I knew I was with some freaks when I first came up on this thing.  So new fit.  I love it.  It's the stupidest thing.  Steve, do you get that on video?  No, I don't do.  All right, we'll get that on video for the fine folks.  That's kind of like, you know, I was on the airplane last night when I was flying here last night. 
[01:49:30]  A lady told me since I was in my earlier life, I was a German shepherd.  Now, a lady came from culture to tell me she wanted to talk to me.  She told me in my earlier life, I was a German shepherd.  Can you believe that?  And I said, you can go back in the back now.  I don't need to.  She said, let me talk to you for a second.  She said, you've got a brother.  He travels all over the world.  Nobody knows where he is.  And I said, that's true.  He plays golf.  Nobody knows where he is.  He said, you're early alive.  She said, you're a German shepherd.  And you got killed in the war, you and your sergeant.  And I can prove it to you because you've got two knots in the back of your neck. 
[01:50:00]  And dogs only have two knots in the back of their neck.  And I put my hand back there, and I do.  And put your hands back there, right back there.  You feel the two knots.  Come on.  And I'm in for something.  So you've got to jump.  I thought I'd get to jump, you know.  That's stupid, huh?  That is stupid.  It was pretty dumb.  It was pretty awful.  Sometimes you do stupid things on radio, don't you?  You had a lot of confidence in it, though.  Nothing better than a psych gag on radio.  They heard the bark. 
[01:50:30]  Everything they're doing first, they heard the bark.  You can see it.  That's another thing I'll be thinking about, too.  What else is in the Michael Jackson thing?  Yeah, we never, I know.  We're all over the place.  Just think if Michael Jackson goes to jail, he has to sing all those songs.  The girl is mine.  Doggone girl is mine.  Yeah, well, I don't think that guy is going to.  Can you feel it?  I don't think he's going to make it through prison.  Not that long.  And it really looks like some of this stuff, he could go.  I bet you $5 Michael Jackson doesn't go to jail.  Why is that? 
[01:51:00]  I don't know.  You don't know?  I don't know.  I bet he doesn't know.  We're in Vegas.  $5.  Ooh, stop me.  What's the odds, right?  Jackson allegedly has, they're saying, because this stuff ended up on smoking guns,  so it's, I guess, testimony from one of his victims.  They say he has splotches on his buttocks and penis.  They said that already, yes.  Yeah.  But they're also saying the one-time accuser. 
[01:51:30]  When I was a kid, I used to go for that.  He can pinpoint the location of the splotches on Jackson's erect penis, its length, and circumcision.  So, now this seems to be stuff that you can't just get makeup.  You're a little weird, too.  You read the whole story, didn't you?  You like to get to the masturbation.  I read it all, didn't I?  Yes, I did.  We have to be informed, George, for the radio show.  Well, did you see how he enunciated erect?  Erect.  And Michael said, masturbation is a wonderful thing. 
[01:52:00]  To the child.  Yes.  In 93.  Doesn't he say between a man and a child?  Yes, between a man and a child.  He said it's natural.  It's a natural act.  Well, you know what?  I shouldn't say this, but any time you're caught with a kid,  I don't think you should have kids.  I wouldn't want kids around me anymore just because of the allegations.  But he keeps doing it.  He keeps doing it.  That's what I'm saying.  That's wrong.  That's wrong.  Being around these kids, and parents keep sending them to these parties.  That's why you need to lock up your parents.  He keeps sending them to these big parties. 
[01:52:30]  Why would you do this?  Why would you do this?  Lock up the parents.  I said lock up the parents.  They should take these kids away if they're taking them to this Neverland ranch.  Well, I don't fault the kids.  I fault the parents completely.  I fault Michael Jackson.  Would you take your kids over there?  Hell no.  I fault Michael Jackson.  Thank you so much, kids.  We should go to prison.  Thank you so much.  You can find them.  We don't have kids, George.  Look at us.  No, no kids.  You don't have kids, either?  No, I hate kids.  We're all freaks up here.  None of us have kids.  Oh, you don't have any kids?  No, but I'm a member of the Half Mile High Club. 
[01:53:00]  Half Mile High Club?  Uh-oh.  What's that?  Well, Mile High...  Mile High is with somebody.  It's sex on an airplane.  You're by yourself.  Oh.  Did you crank one out on an airplane?  We got...  You think that's terrible it's on a plane when you fly with me?  Jesus.  And I guarantee you, I'm not the only one.  Look at all these weird freaks out here looking at us.  I don't know.  I guarantee you, half of them are members of the Half Mile High Club.  And you've done it, too.  You've done it.  I have never done that on a plane.  Well, you should try. 
[01:53:30]  That seems to be difficult, especially in coach, if you're next to people.  You don't do it in your seat, idiot.  Where do you do it?  Probably the bathroom.  In the bathroom?  In the bathroom.  Or the cockpit.  You do it in the bathroom?  I'm with some sick people.  This is XM.  Of course you do it.  How quickly, though?  Because if you're in there too long, people get a little impatient.  It's okay.  They can wait.  They can wait.  They can wait.  And you finish up. 
[01:54:00]  And then you've got to use that stupid sink that don't work to wash it off your hands.  Yeah, a lot of napkins in there.  A lot of things in there.  You know, there's nothing wrong with that.  I'm sure Kobe Bryant wished he had done that.  You know what I tell him all the time?  Kobe.  You know, room service still, first of all, room service still going to be a hell for Kobe.  You know that, right?  He goes to any hotel in the world.  You know, I'll call down, I like your bottle of champagne and T-bone steak.  Sir, we think you better come out here and pick that up yourself, you know?  And he's got to do what I do.  I told him, I told him personally, do what I do.  Stick with the lotion.  And just be with yourself? 
[01:54:30]  Stick with the lotion.  You know, hotels know who their number one customers are.  Single businessmen, right?  Uh-huh.  Have you noticed how convenient they place the box of tissue next to the lotion?  A lot of tissues and a lot of lotion in the hotel bathroom.  Sure.  You should know.  I go, well.  It doesn't have to stay in the bathroom.  You can take it where you want to take it.  You can go out and see a room.  It doesn't matter.  You can open the windows.  Lotion stinks.  I bring Eros.  It's a big black bottle of lubricant, which would work on an engine.  It's phenomenal stuff.  Dice turned us on to that.  Dice turned us on to that.  It's kind of like Mobile One. 
[01:55:00]  You can go here and you can go back.  Greatest stuff ever.  I don't like lotion at all.  It has aloe in it.  It's painful.  The aloe causes it.  It's painful.  I've never heard about that.  How long are you cranking this where you need a lubrication like an engine?  I'll isolate for hours, just kind of looking at my computer screen, tweaking my nipple,  and just being alone.  It's disgusting.  You're a freak.  You know that?  Sorry, ladies and gentlemen.  Doesn't that conjure up an image?  You know, everybody, they're taking notes.  They're horrified.  It's true.  They're horrified with what he has to say today. 
[01:55:30]  I'm horrified.  This is great.  We don't have any commercials on XM?  No.  There's a couple every now and then.  This is nice, though, to come here.  You guys have a wonderful job here on XM Satellite.  It's nice, yeah.  Good morning to some people and good afternoon to others.  How about that?  We don't know what time it is.  Well, it's 11 o'clock, 11.55 on the West Coast.  We'll just know in like four minutes we get to start gambling.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  What's your favorite game here?  We're going to probably do a little blackjack.  We should all hook up at a table.  We're going to do it.  You don't gamble, though, you said.  You know, but I like to have fun when I go with friends, you know. 
[01:56:00]  I play craps.  Yeah, with friends.  Oh, you play craps?  Yeah, yeah.  I never get that game.  You see, there are people there yelling out things I don't even understand.  It doesn't matter which game you play, craps, blackjack, you put your money on the table,  they pick it up.  It doesn't matter.  You never left ahead.  Yeah, I leave ahead a lot, but I don't gamble.  I've been there for years, and you cannot win.  I don't care if you win $100,000.  You cannot win at Las Vegas.  If you ever walk across me, some guy just walks across me.  That's Martini Steve.  I start to kick him off the stage.  He's a big shot.  Don't worry about it.  He's not as big as he says.  Is that right?  You know him well, don't you?  Yeah, he's one of our guys. 
[01:56:30]  He just can't go that way because of the wires.  In any case, you just have fun gambling.  Make sure you have fun.  That's all you do while you're in Las Vegas.  Make sure you have a good time.  I hear people that work here don't gamble.  A lot of people that work here don't because it'll turn into a problem.  Sure, it won't become a problem.  You just give your money back to your boss.  What do the locals do here?  They're not gambling.  What do they do here for fun?  Well, they go.  I'm serious.  They come here to retire for the weather.  You know what the weather's like here, right?  It's nice today, even though it's snowing today and raining.  But you come here and.  Yeah, they have weather here.  Oh, okay.  You come here in July and August.  You're not going to believe this. 
[01:57:00]  It's 116 degrees at midnight.  That's crazy.  And the people are just, you know, I think it's working with just doing something to their  mind because it's stupid.  I mean, all the entertainers got their plastic surgery, you know, and they're melting away  like you won't believe.  There's no reason to leave.  Yeah, you're walking down the street.  You step into vanilla ice cream.  You look down.  You're walking on Joan Rivers.  You never know what the hell's going on.  That's my little plastic surgery joke.  There's no reason to leave the hotel.  But the people that live here, they have a good time.  They retire here.  They can come.  They can see shows.  And that's why this is the fastest growing city in America right now. 
[01:57:30]  Because you can eat dinner here.  If you want, you can have breakfast for $2, $1.99.  You know, you can have cheap dinners here.  I see the places outside of the big, you know, casino resort areas where in the gas station,  it says gas and video poker.  You can go in the gas station and play video poker.  Why?  Oh, hey.  How bad is it?  That's our two-minute warning.  That's our two-minute warning.  Why would you play at the gas station when there are beautiful, like, casinos everywhere?  Why are you then going to play in the gas station? 
[01:58:00]  These people are hooked, man.  Not only the gas station.  In the grocery stores here.  You go to grocery stores, they've got video machines.  What about the airport?  Oh, right off the plane.  You already lost all your money, and you're waiting for your flight, and you're continuing to throw it.  What a different set of people.  When you get to the airport, your plane lands, you go to your gate, and then you get off your plane.  The people coming off are all smiling, and you look at the people sitting in the seats waiting to get on the plane.  Just a bunch of miserable bastards.  Well, first of all, you're already pissed when you're at the airport because they go through you.  They're making me take my shoes off, you know. 
[01:58:30]  I just paid $500 for these shoes.  You think I'm going to blow them up?  It makes me sick when you get out there.  And they're going through my luggage.  You know what I start doing?  I start putting my dirty drawers right on top.  Oh, you want to go through this plane?  Where do you get a whiff of this?  I got the bomb for your ass.  Well, just open that up.  Oh, it's awful.  Toxic waste on the plane isn't allowed.  You should do that.  You know how you're on the way.  Oh, my God.  All right, we've got to get out of here, I guess.  We've got to get out of here.  It's time to go.  You guys, it's here for George Wallace.  Thank you so much.  Open your front to me right here at XM Satellite Radio all over America. 
[01:59:00]  Thank you so much.  Something good is going to happen to you.  Hallelujah.  Hallelujah.  And we're done for today.  That was easy.  That was easy.  That's George Wallace.  We're all at the Flamingo, 10 o'clock.  That's right.  And tomorrow, I guess we're going to be at the porn convention, huh?  Yeah.  Yeah, we are.  Going to the porn convention.  Nice.  I think tomorrow's going to be a different show, Anthony.  Just a little.  What kind of showcasing here for the CES?  We're under our best behavior.  Our last hour, we kind of blew it with the Playboy Girls and stuff.  The language got a little saucy.  You knew it was going to happen. 
[01:59:30]  I know.  We do our best, but...  But tomorrow, C-word.  C-word?  I'm teasing it.  Tomorrow, C-word, tomorrow.  That's cash.  That's got to be cash.  It's not cash.  We're in Vegas.  Could be cash.  It could be cash.  Yeah.  Could be country.  Could be country.  Oh, gotcha.  You can take Salem out of the country.  What?  All right.  Now we're out of here.  We'll see you guys tomorrow.  We'll see you guys tomorrow.  Program complete.  The stories.  Down the left field line.  Is it enough? 
[02:00:00]  Goal!  No, it is.  Sixty-two.  The memories.  Unbelievable.  A home run for Gibson.  And the Dodgers have won the game five to four.  I don't believe what I just saw.  The magic.  The giant number five.  The giant number five.  Passion is renewed this February as spring training opens for the 2005 season.
