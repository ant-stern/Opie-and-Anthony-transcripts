<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with Opie, Anthony, and James Norton discussing their weekends.  Anthony recounted a trip to the New York Renaissance Festival, noting the lack of Black attendees and detailing his observations, including archery, hatchet throwing, and an abundance of sausage consumption.  The hosts debated the festival's authenticity, with callers offering their opinions. The conversation then shifted to the poor box office performance of Artie Lange's movie, "Beer League," followed by a discussion of a slow news day featuring Pete Rose's gambling admission and a bizarre story about a police officer allegedly knocking out a poodle's teeth. This led to an extended segment on dogs and listener anecdotes, peppered with "damage" points, a recurring in-show joke.  Marina Franklin was mentioned as a guest, and the impending appearances of Jet Li and Spike Ferriston were teased. The broadcast also promoted upcoming live events and a new Opie and Anthony Mac widget, all while utilizing heavy profanity and offensive stereotypes.  A caller's negative comments about Upstate New York initiated a debate that continued later in the show.

The show continued with a heated debate about Upstate New York fueled by a caller named Lee, escalating into insults and playful arguments, and a rant about the Pope's apology for controversial statements on Islam, including discussions about religious violence and intolerance.  The hosts expressed anger and frustration, using strong language and making disparaging remarks about Islam.  A news report about a carjacking targeting elderly white people provoked further controversial comments.  Spike Ferriston, a *Seinfeld* writer, joined the show, discussing his career, the "Soup Nazi" episode, his new Fox talk show, and anecdotes about working with Jerry Seinfeld, touching upon darker *Seinfeld* elements.  E-Rock's tardiness was discussed, with a new employee acting as a timekeeper.  The segment concluded with promotions for the Opie and Anthony live show and Ferriston's new talk show.

The broadcast then focused on staff commute times, particularly Kenny's obsessive punctuality, which was presented as a running joke.  A news report about a deadly E. coli outbreak in spinach sparked speculation about its cause, ranging from terrorism to protesting Mexican laborers to a sick food worker. This led to offensive jokes about replacing cheap immigrant labor. An anecdote about a person with Down syndrome working security at a Renaissance festival was also included, seemingly out of context.  The main segment featured an in-studio interview with Jet Li and director Ronnie Yu for *Fearless*.  The conversation covered Li's career transition, martial arts background, Bruce Lee, and CGI in action films, interspersed with the hosts' comedic interjections and off-color humor.  Li discussed his martial arts philosophy and explained why *Fearless* was his last "wushu" film.  Further segments included a bit about Opie's milk addiction, banter with an Australian friend, and more off-color jokes.  The show continued with further commentary on the Jet Li interview and more jokes and tangents.  The entire segment employed crude language, racial and ethnic slurs, and jokes about pedophilia.


A later segment heavily featured a discussion about martial artists, specifically Chuck Norris, with a martial artist guest, "Master Poe." Poe assessed Norris's current fighting capabilities, suggesting he wouldn't pose much of a challenge.  Comedian Jimmy Schubert called in, recounting a disastrous stand-up performance in Camden, New Jersey, where he was heavily booed.  The hosts analyzed a clip of a female weather reporter accidentally saying "rip cunts" on air, making crude jokes.  They also analyzed Schubert's yearbook photo and entries, speculating on their meaning.  The show also discussed the sitcom "Till Death," playing clips and critiquing its humor, briefly mentioning a scandalous incident involving former New Jersey Governor Jim McGreevy.  The segment was characterized by crude humor and sexually explicit and offensive language.


The final segment discussed the perceived mediocrity of network sitcoms compared to online content.  A lengthy comedic bit followed, involving sound clips and jokes about "Woodcock" from a sitcom (likely *Mr. Woodcock*), featuring crude and offensive dialogue, including sexual innuendos and homophobic slurs.  A significant portion was dedicated to an expletive-laden argument about a pool table's placement.  Craig, a young intern whose hat style was ridiculed, was a studio guest.  The conversation with Craig was vulgar and offensive, touching upon his personal life, employment, and appearance.  Listener calls shared what they learned from the broadcast, followed by additional banter and a listener gift for Anthony leading to another comedic segment. The segment was characterized by highly offensive and vulgar language and humor.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show on XM202 featuring Opie, Anthony, and James Norton.  The strength is their ability to turn mistruth into something people would believe.  Wow, how long is this guy going to continue to babble and say nothing?  All day long!  Shut up!  Alright, here we go.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's worse than I imagined.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry. 
[00:00:30]  We are a bunch of dopes.  I think we're loose.  We're probably pushing 20 arrests because of this radio show.  Out of touch, corn balls, three retards.  We have the effect of Tylenol PM.  Opie.  You know I could have been a model.  Anthony.  I'm dead!  James Norton.  I like yogurt.  Robert Reed.  But enough of this palaver. 
[00:01:00]  Let's get the show on the road.  It's out Friday-wide.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  Hi. 
[00:01:30]  Hey.  Hi.  Welcome.  Hi.  Hello.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  The ONA virus spreading across America. 
[00:02:00]  How was everyone's weekend?  Wonderful.  Fantastic.  Did anyone do anything fun or exciting or different this weekend?  I went boogie boarding.  What the hell are you boogie boarding? It's too cold already.  No, it's not.  As it is.  No, it's not. Summer's still happening.  Summer's gone. Gone. 
[00:02:30]  Actually, the beach was packed yesterday.  Packed yesterday.  I went to Robert Moses.  Robert Moses.  Hung out with the surfers.  The surfers?  Yeah, there was some pretty crazy waves yesterday.  See any stingrays? You know, they're deadly.  Saw, uh, saw no stingrays, no.  Fucking hell.  No stingrays.  But a bunch of asses trying to fish in the middle of, uh, people trying to surf.  What's that all about? 
[00:03:00]  I was fishing on the beach like that.  Get out of it. Get off the beach.  For the most part, I hate people.  Yeah.  And I'm reminded, uh, that I hate people almost every day because people just stink and do dumb things.  I'm at Robert Moses.  I'm at, uh, Field 5, almost Field 4.  And, uh, well, you know, just trying to keep it local for, uh, the Long Islanders there, right?  Yeah. And, uh, there are, there are dozens and dozens of people, um, surfing and bodyboarding and, and, uh, and, uh, boogie boarding and, uh, body surfing, whatever. 
[00:03:30]  And then other people just hanging out in the water.  So it was a great day to be in the water yesterday, even though, uh, you think it's cold, Anthony.  Freezing.  It was 82 degrees at the beach yesterday.  I know. That's cold.  And then you got these guys that are trying to catch fish offshore.  So they're casting into hooks.  They're casting into where everyone's surfing.  Dodge the hooks.  And then, so they'll, they'll throw their line in and then they, you know, put it in the sand, whatever, and then sit back and wait. 
[00:04:00]  Mm-hmm.  Wait, I guess they're waiting to, you know, snag a surfer.  I don't know.  What group of people are these?  Huh?  What group of people?  Nah, unfortunately, you got to blame Whitey on this one.  Are they all Whitey?  Got to blame Whitey.  I thought Portuguese were into that.  Got to blame Whitey with the beer belly on this one.  Really?  Yeah.  And then they're getting annoyed because some of the surfers are getting too close to their lines.  What?  Get in a boat.  You know those.  Fish like a real person.  You know those beaches?  All you have to do is go another, I don't know, 100 yards down the beach. 
[00:04:30]  Deserted.  Deserted, exactly.  But they have to, they have to cast in the middle of everybody for some odd reason.  That's where the fish are, I guess.  So, but it was a great day at the beach.  That's about all I have on that.  The water itself, not cold?  No, not really.  Not really.  I need blue Caribbean water and 90 degrees or I don't go in.  And then I go in up to my ankles.  Oh, there are monsters in the water.  You were too busy at the Renaissance Festival. 
[00:05:00]  That's right.  I was in beautiful tuxedo New York at the Renaissance Festival, the New York Renaissance Festival.  What is that?  That's where people go and a lot of people are dressed up in Renaissance attire and talking like they did in the olden days.  And you buy, you know, a yard of mead and you can get a big turkey leg to eat if you want. 
[00:05:30]  I don't even want to look at them.  And there are wenches walking around with their bosoms pushed up in corsets.  Did you or did you not dress up?  I absolutely did not dress up.  You have dressed up in past years, haven't you?  I never went to the Renaissance Festival and dressed up.  I just don't do it.  So you're not a LARPer?  No.  I've dressed for Halloween as like a Renaissance guy.  But that was just a goof. 
[00:06:00]  But it's Halloween.  It was just a goof, right?  It's Halloween.  So you weren't walking around the Renaissance Festival like a LARPer?  No.  You weren't LARPing?  No.  They have the people that work there that dress up.  What do black people do during this awful time?  Well, let me tell you something.  I was hanging out, me and my girlfriend, a couple of her girlfriends, and one of the girlfriend's boyfriends, Gus.  Very cool guy.  It kind of gives me somebody to talk to while the girls are going blind because they all bought costumes and stuff and dress up. 
[00:06:30]  So they dressed up?  The girls dress up.  Yeah.  And they walk around.  And then we walk around.  The girls are dressed up.  And they got little shops.  And you buy little things.  And you watch things go on.  They got the jousts and sword fights and things going on like that.  And so me and Gus pretty much just goof on everything that's going on there.  And he goes, you notice something?  Like what? 
[00:07:00]  He goes, well, you know, lack of something.  I'm like, oh, okay.  Black people.  Isn't the future great?  They don't see the future.  Oh, excuse me.  Wrong joke.  Apparently, black people, not very interested in the Renaissance Festival.  Why would they?  I know.  And Gus brought up a good point.  It's like anything before the Emancipation Proclamation is nothing but pain and slavery and conquering. 
[00:07:30]  So I don't think they like being involved with that kind of thing.  A lot of white people.  A lot of bikers for some reason are into it.  A lot of geeks are into it.  So, you know, you get people that like sci-fi that are into it.  And I don't know.  You just walk around.  It's entertaining.  I took a lot of pictures.  But all the pictures I took are of most of them anyway.  They sell these huge sausages on a stick.  And they're just giant. 
[00:08:00]  I swear they have to be a foot long and as thick as if you made a fist.  And all I was doing was taking pictures of girls biting into these things and guys alike.  Do you have these pictures on the website?  Those and the chocolate-covered bananas.  Yeah, I got a few.  Those and the chocolate-covered bananas.  Because we followed some guy around for I don't know how long until he actually took a bite and got a big picture of him putting his mouth over this thing.  And then feeding it to another guy. 
[00:08:30]  It was fantastic.  And these big fat women.  We got this one.  She had just bought it at the stand.  Yeah.  And her eyes are open so wide and her mouth is open wide and she's shoving this big sausage in her mouth.  You got to make your entertainment where you can.  Where was this?  How far from New York?  It's about an hour or so drive in the tuxedo New York.  Someone from their cell phone renaissance festival where people go to be medieval faggots. 
[00:09:00]  Oh, there are some people go all out.  I mean like almost full suits of armor.  And then there's the guys that want to be like wear tights and like Shakespearean type outfits.  And it's just nothing but it looks like they're trying to steal a pumpkin from the Lord down the front of their tights.  It's like could you put on a kilt or something?  Could you cover that up? 
[00:09:30]  There's no reason to walk around like that.  There's no reason to walk around at all up there.  Well, it's a renaissance festival.  There's a fine reason to walk around.  Here, take this, ye.  Well, there is a little fun to be had after you've had a few yards of ale.  What you do is you go over by the archery, which is a, they give you like 25 arrows for a few bucks and a bow and you shoot into hay bales. 
[00:10:00]  Are you trying to make this sound cool?  No, no.  Jimmy, are you listening to this?  Yeah.  And I'm not.  You're trying to make this sound cool.  It's like, well, after a few yards, meaning I'm hammered now.  Yeah, yeah.  Let me tell you how cool it is.  You catch a little buzz.  You grab your arrows and your bow.  Oh, you get to shoot arrows into hay.  See, but you don't shoot it into the hay.  See, me and Gus were shooting it over the top of the backdrop into the woods where we heard things and traffic.  So I'm not sure if maybe we've injured somebody or trying to hit the wooden boundary railing that you're not supposed to be aiming for. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah.  And I said we'd make the news if we all just turned around and shot one person in the chest with the arrows.  That would kind of.  Well, you know, eventually that's going to happen and then it's going to be no more arrows.  No more arrows.  Then this hatchet throwing at targets, you know, you pick up your hatchet and you give it a good throw.  And I got to purchase a brand new rapier. 
[00:11:00]  So I have a new one to add to my rapier collection.  When you swing that, are you a rapiest?  No, rapiest.  Yes, that's what they call me.  Those will be proudly displayed in my office.  I just think it's funny you got stuck with a guy named Gus.  Gus is a good egg.  I'm sure he's fantastic, but did you have to go, hey, Gus, check this out.  Gus.  Change your name.  Gustav.  He looks like Himmler.  He's German and looks like Himmler.  So it's kind of fun to hang around with him. 
[00:11:30]  He knows a lot about German history.  Fun guy.  I remind you this morning that we are shock jocks.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  He's just shocking.  A lot of friends, though, I got to say, I have never been, look, see, here we go.  Never been to an event aside from an ONA event where I've seen and had more ONA fans come  up to me and recognize me from the show and love the show than at the Renaissance Fair.  We must be failing pretty badly. 
[00:12:00]  I don't have to pay for anything.  People come up.  I go, you know, give me like a beer or something.  Just get it.  Just get it for free.  They're great.  Nice people.  But I hear they were stepping out of character and stuff.  Yeah.  That kind of ruins it a little bit.  Yeah.  See, it ruins it for Anthony.  It ruins the experience.  Because he really wants everyone in character around him.  So I'm in line and, you know, the guy behind the bar is like, you know, to the guy in front  of me, is like, ah, my lord, would thou like a yard of mead? 
[00:12:30]  Would you like some mead, some honey mead?  Ah, yes.  Anything for the ladies, sir?  All right.  You know, so I go up there and it's like, dude, Anthony, love the show.  Dude, have a bud.  You know, you guys were doing that bit the other day.  It's like, what happened to the accent?  Where's the character?  I want the guy.  The hello, me lord.  Well, they also want the guy.  Yeah. 
[00:13:00]  That they think they know from the radio show.  So you both lost.  You both lost on that one.  They're expecting impersonations and fun.  And shuckery.  And it's so they get, yeah.  Hey, they were there, too.  They were working.  They all enjoy it.  Even the people working there.  I see it like a big carny gypsy thing where I picture at night, they're all just having  sex with each other and drinking the leftover mead.  They're like gypsies from the 1700s or something. 
[00:13:30]  Why do they call it mead?  I don't know.  It's different from beer, mead.  I was just drinking, you know, bud.  So it's a beer product?  Yeah, I think it is.  It's some kind of weird beer wine mix thing.  I don't know.  But they have wine.  They had, like, and in past years, they had really kind of adhered to the whole medieval  thing.  But I'm starting to notice they're changing a few things.  Like, like you used to, you know, the turkey leg was pretty much all you could get or some 
[00:14:00]  other things.  A bowl made out of some baked bread with some gruel in it, like some soup or something.  And now you look up and there's Yee Tony's Pizza.  You know, it kind of takes away from the whole thing.  And there's people dressed up, you know, I think I saw a Klingon.  It's like, could you leave the sci-fi, you know, expo garb out of the Renaissance thing?  Keep it, you know, in the right era.  You know, you're right.  When I go LARPing.  I wasn't LARPing. 
[00:14:30]  I was at a Renaissance festival.  Well, one of the biggest.  I want everyone to be LARPing in the same era.  When you go up there, are Yee in a town that has just kind of decided to transform itself?  Well, the whole town is very small.  It's a very small town.  So everywhere you go, there are people in Renaissance attire getting ready to go to the  big Renaissance fair, which is held at the same location.  And they have little shows that they put on.  There's like an acrobat guy and other medieval type entertainment events. 
[00:15:00]  Why don't they let it go?  It's been a long time since the medieval.  People seem to enjoy that time and dressing up and acting like that for some reason.  Why, it's silly.  There's no medical knowledge.  It was just an awful time.  Well, that's what I said.  They should have done that.  Like, you know, they'd lop someone's head off and then have some guy come over and just  put a few leeches on it.  Something like the real old school medicine.  But people just seem to enjoy that, that whole era and the attire and acting like that. 
[00:15:30]  I don't know why.  There's just some English people there and thought it would be weird for them to see a  bunch of Americans acting like, you know, their old culture.  Yeah.  I thought it would be weird if maybe in England they had some kind of a thing where they auction  off people and do things like we did here.  All right.  Let's go to the phone and say hi to Hunter and Wayne.  Hunter, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Hey.  Anthony, if you actually said that you if you're admitting on the air that you went 
[00:16:00]  to a renaissance fair.  Yes.  Basically, at this point, to quote Tony Soprano, he's a fig.  Why would that be?  Why?  I go just about every year.  OK.  It's fun to go with to with friends.  You have fun and you get to.  And I'm not saying I don't have a good time there, but you do get to make fun of a lot  of people that are there.  Yeah.  Opie, when you went pumpkin picking.  You may just make Opie's pumpkin picking look cool.  He went with his girlfriend. 
[00:16:30]  And Gus.  And Gus.  Yeah.  Meaning his girlfriend was his beard.  Because Gus was there.  Gus was his real date.  Gus was his real date.  Gus was not my date.  We got to commiserate a bit.  What was it?  Gus and Elmer?  Were you Elmer for the day?  No, I was not Elmer.  Was that the name of the old couple?  The old gay guys?  Was it Gus and Elmer?  It was Gus and Elmer.  Did Gus buy a sausage and then smack your face with it?  He didn't buy it. 
[00:17:00]  Hey, this isn't sausage.  Anybody remember me cool was at the beach yesterday, like Opie.  All right, yeah.  Oh, wow, man.  All right, man.  Yeah, real cool.  Where were you, Hunter?  I was at Sandy Hook yesterday.  Doing what?  Just getting myself a nice tan.  Yeah, nice, man.  I hope you get skin cancer.  It was one of the last nice beach days of the year.  Oh, for around here.  Stupid beach around here.  Thank you, bro.  Thank you.  That's Hunter.  Green water.  You can't see your belly button through the water. 
[00:17:30]  Oh, you don't know anything.  Oh, I know everything about the goddamn beach.  You don't know where to go.  The water's too effing cold.  You don't know where to go.  The weather's too cold to go to the beach.  You don't know where to go.  The beach is full of convicts.  You don't know where to go.  That's Jones Beach.  I don't go there.  That's Jones Beach.  Let's go to Eric.  Eric.  What's up, fellas?  Make it fast.  Come on.  Just want to let you know that mead is beer made from honey.  Oh, Steve should have come running and telling us that.  Oh, beer made from honey?  Beer made from honey.  It's wonderful.  All right. 
[00:18:00]  Thank you, sir.  Thank you.  Beer made from honey.  All right.  There were a lot of bees there yesterday, though.  Let's go to Brenda.  Very frightening.  Brenda.  Hey, guys.  How are you?  Hey.  Hi, Brenda.  Hey.  First of all, mead is honey, sweet honey wine.  I work at the bars.  I already know it.  I know.  And secondly, Anthony, I was the crazy girl who gave me the pin at the end of the day.  Yes.  She came running out at the end of the day and gave me a nice Opie and Anthony Wow pin.  So do you work there every year, miss?  I've worked there for the last 15 years of my life because I'm a loser. 
[00:18:30]  15 years.  What's your job at the Renaissance Festival?  I served beer at the restaurant.  You served me.  Can you say something in older and talk, lady?  No.  I gave up my accent like 10 years ago.  Well, come on.  She gave it up.  What do you say?  She just said, screw it.  Good day, everybody.  I don't know.  I gave it up.  It's too early to be doing this.  Come on, ye.  Give us something.  Something from the Renaissance there.  Give us what you used to.  When you used to have a passion for it and someone would come up and go, what do you have 
[00:19:00]  today, m'lady?  Actually, I had them come up and it used to be, what be thy thirst?  What be thy thirst?  What be thy thirst?  What be thy thirst?  And then it goes into the Budweiser, Sam Adams.  Yeah, real old-fashioned, right?  Real oldie-time beers.  All right, Brandon.  Thank you.  Let's go to Phlegm in Jersey.  Phlegm, what's up?  Shoot ye self.  Exactly. 
[00:19:30]  Phlegm.  It's a whole day looking at hooters there, man, and cleavage.  That's what you do.  How many times your girlfriend catch you?  You know, the girls wrap themselves up in these corsets and squeeze their bosoms out  of the top, so you see a lot of cleavage.  It's all you do there, man.  It's like you just walk around looking at these women squirting their breasts at you.  But some of the guys don't want to, like, I refuse to dress up.  I've been asked many times, I refuse. 
[00:20:00]  And then it's like, well, just wear this hat.  Or just wear this.  I go, no, because you either have to go all out and wear the complete thing or just wear  regular clothes, because it would be even sillier than dressing up totally, would be  the guy, because you see him walking around all the time.  He's got the jeans, the sneakers, and he's wearing, like, an oldie-time chainmail vest  and a helmet.  It's like, what are you? 
[00:20:30]  But you're wearing jeans and sneakers.  Either go all out or don't do it at all.  Yeah, Jimmy and I agree.  When you're LARPing, you've got to go all out.  What's it LARPing?  If it's not 100% LARPing, then you don't LARP at all in my book.  See, LARPing is role-playing.  Is it?  It's when you actually do what most people do online games with points and stuff.  And that's a whole game thing.  Two damage, two damage, two damage.  Right, right.  That is not happening at the Renaissance Festival. 
[00:21:00]  What are some of the other things you could yell out at your fellow LARPer?  Two damage, two damage.  And they cast a spell with a beanbag.  I know they cast spells with beanbags.  They yell, we're faggots.  We're faggots.  Well, yeah, you won't hear me defending the LARPers.  But I have fun at the Renaissance Festival.  Yeah.  It's, you know.  All right.  Do ye.  Ye do.  All right.  Why don't we take a break?  We're just getting warmed up.  I would throw in lines from Superman. 
[00:21:30]  Yeah.  Because they're all geeky and they know them.  And I would throw in Zod lines.  Like they would ask you something.  Because people just come up to you and go, have thou seen my husband?  Like trying to get some role-playing thing going.  Yeah.  And they'll ask you about, like, why you're wearing such strange clothing.  So I'd give them the old, why do you ask these questions when you know I shall kill you for it?  Remember Zod from Superman?  Yeah, I do.  And they look so puzzled.  No.  It was to get a complete puzzled look. 
[00:22:00]  You finally leave your house and this is what you do?  It was a complete puzzled look you would get from these Renaissance fair people.  But we would all laugh because we knew what it was.  Yeah, of course.  That's wonderful, Anthony.  Here's how you should answer that.  It's General Zod.  Yeah, it sure is.  But what do they say to you?  Leave his house for the first time in five years to do this.  They would say something like, you go, excuse me, where are the bathrooms?  And they go, well, does thou wish to take the bath? 
[00:22:30]  And you're like, you know, you just want to take a whiz.  Another Zod line coming up?  No, no.  Then they would go, oh, you must be looking for the privy.  For the privy.  And you laugh and you go.  I would say this.  I wish you were dead.  They asked me a question that they wanted to role play.  I wish you were dead.  I got something.  Yes?  Thou is bored.  No.  It's fun.  Thou is bored.  Jimmy?  I probably wouldn't dig it. 
[00:23:00]  I would go for the goof factor.  Just have a laugh.  It is really fun.  I tell you, when you go with friends, it is very fun because you do.  There are plenty of things to just go, oh, my God, look at that, and goof on.  All right.  Let's go to one more call and then we take a break here.  Dale, Jersey, what's up?  Hey, how's it going?  I love the show, guys.  All right.  Two damage.  Two damage.  I just wanted to see if Anthony saw the guy that looked like Scott Weil walking around  with a tambourine at the fair.  Was he the guy that tried to look like Captain Jack Sparrow? 
[00:23:30]  No, no, no, no.  This guy had a bandana on.  He had one boot on and one sandal on.  He was walking around like a freak shaking a tambourine.  Yeah, they got a lot of old hippies and weirdos there.  And then there was a Jack Sparrow walking around, which was like, now they've introduced  pirates.  Now they've introduced pirates to the Renaissance.  And you would know the difference, right?  Pirates are clinging on.  I would just assume pirates are part of the whole thing.  I don't know.  I wish.  I wouldn't know. 
[00:24:00]  See?  No.  There weren't.  There usually weren't pirates.  I would be like, well, that pirate looks like the dress of the day, so there must have  been pirates.  Next year, I plan on screwing the whole thing up by taking a bunch of people dressed in original  classic Star Trek attire and saying that we beam down to this planet where it's exactly  like Renaissance-era Earth and just scan people with a tricorder and medical equipment  and say how we can't talk about what we're doing here because it would violate the Prime 
[00:24:30]  Directive.  And hit them with your plastic swords.  Two damage!  Two damage!  I have a phaser.  Why would I do that?  Two damage!  I would have a phaser.  That would be silly.  So that would be three damage?  That would be silly.  Because that would be a little more powerful than a plastic sword.  Instant dead.  You warping faggots out there.  1,600 damage.  He'd be dead.  I cast a spell!  Bam!  With my beanbag!  Anthony, what is it that they yell out when you give them a tip?  Huzzah!  Huzzah. 
[00:25:00]  What is that?  Huzzah!  To the tipper!  Huzzah, indeed.  Huzzah!  When you give a little tip after you're done getting your beer.  Yeah.  You give it to them and they ring a bell.  Cling, clang, clang, clang, clang, clang.  Huzzah!  To the generous tipper!  Nice.  Love the show, guys.  Gotta work for a living.  Take it easy.  Yes, Jimmy, they do an appreciation for the tip.  Huzzah!  Oh, no.  Why do thou look at me like that? 
[00:25:30]  That's the noise you should make when you wake up and realize there's a large gentleman  straddling you in your bed and you feel a sharp, wincing pain.  And that's what wakes you up.  Huzzah!  Huzzah!  Should be the sound that comes out of your mouth.  Let's go to James in New Hampshire.  James.  Hey, Jimmy, Opie.  Yeah.  I just have to know, how are you fighting off the urge to give him an atomic wedgie?  You high school geek. 
[00:26:00]  Yeah, we're going to have Club Soda Kenny give you a wedgie.  I will not get a wedgie for attending the Renaissance Festival.  Many people do.  It's a very popular event every year.  It's on for weeks, a couple of weeks, and it does very well.  Yeah, all right.  I think I stuffed you in a locker at least twice in high school.  You did not, tough guy.  And had guns.  I have a brand new rapier I'll run ye through.  Two damage. 
[00:26:30]  Two damage.  Two damage.  All right, let's take a break.  Just getting warmed up.  Let us taketh thine breaks.  Huzzah!  Huzzah to the break.  Huzzah!  No?  All right, it's the ONA virus spreading across the land.  The realm.  The shire.  Give me some beanbags so I can cast spells all morning. 
[00:27:00]  Sorry, Mike Cutback Davis.  Those guys are fags.  What?  I'm using surfer names for you.  Oh, I don't know a surfer.  Crap, I just like waves.  It's just from past times.  All right.  Come here, miss.  Huzzah!  Huzzah!  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  That was a clip from Anthony, the retarded half of the Opie and Anthony show.

[00:28:00]  You're checking out The Opie and Anthony Show.  Hope you had a great weekend.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  1-866-313-FREE.  Thou did.  You had a great weekend, right?  Thou did.  Oh, I saw a great movie over the weekend.  What'd you watch?  Beer League.  No, I didn't.  Matter of fact, no one did. 
[00:28:30]  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  Biggest bomb in movie history, Artie Lang.  Ugh.  And you're going to critique our Letterman appearance, you douche.  What a bomb.  Go, screw!  Your pal Howie has no power anymore.  It made no money at the box office.  How do you like them apples, ass?  That's terrible.  I'm sorry. 
[00:29:00]  You're going to try to say that our Letterman appearance was, uh, when everyone else said  it was a fine appearance.  Fine.  It was great.  And then two days later, your movie opens to empty movie houses all over America.  Empty seats.  Even when a movie does something as poorly as that, you've got to wonder, who the hell  went?  Who's sitting there?  No matter what piece of crap movie comes out, it always makes something. 
[00:29:30]  You know?  Even if it's just like $100,000.  There's a few people that went there and decided, that's the movie I want to see.  You've got to just be rounded up.  Chopped their heads off.  $320,000 at the box office.  That's terrific.  $320,000?  Yeah.  That's terrific.  Oof.  That's for the whole country.  Yikes.  Front pages of the New York Papers today.  I guess it's a slow news day? 
[00:30:00]  Must be.  There's sports on the cover.  Yeah, when you've got sports stories on the front page of the papers, you know it's been  a slow, uh, it's a slow news day.  Unless it's OJ.  Well, the Giants had a great win with Eli.  Eli, uh, you know, uh, uh, in OT having a great game yesterday.  So the Giants won over, uh, the Eagles.  And, uh, the Daily News, for Pete's sake, auction house sale disgraced Rose's bizarre  baseball mea culpa.  I guess Rose is now signing baseballs.  I'm sorry.  I bet on baseball. 
[00:30:30]  Signed Pete Rose.  I would love one of these.  That's great.  But they're making it sound like this is just another, another bad day in, uh, Pete Rose's  life.  What's wrong with that?  Everyone knows what he did.  Come on.  Be honest.  And, uh.  Well, let's say it's front page news, so it's important to somebody.  If he's signing baseball, what do you think?  Did he sign a bunch of these or just one like that?  Well, he finally admitted he betted on baseball in what, uh, 2004, was it?  A couple years back now?  Just too late.  Ending years of lies, he admits to betting on baseball in his book, My Prison Without Bars. 
[00:31:00]  That was January 5th, 2004.  And today, Daily News reveals sale of autographed baseballs with Rose's autograph and handwritten  message, I'm sorry, I bet on baseball.  Gotta fetch a dime or two, huh?  And then the headline is, uh, Pete's signs of his sorry, sorry times.  Who cares?  Who really cares?  Is that front page news?  At this point. 
[00:31:30]  No.  He's doing what he's gotta do.  You know, they're not gonna let him in, uh, baseball in his lifetime.  Let him back in baseball in his lifetime.  He's not gonna be in the Hall of Fame in his lifetime.  Eventually, he will be, by the way.  And, uh, so he's doing what he has to do, and he's making money off these baseballs.  God bless Pete Rose.  God bless him.  Yeah.  That ain't front page news, though.  No, and then we got a great little story about, um, a man claiming cops knocked out, uh, his 
[00:32:00]  poodle's teeth.  Now that's front page news.  That should have been on the front page.  That would have sold papers today, right?  Right.  I guess this guy goes to the hospital, cause he's, uh, insomniac, and he was on, uh, Ambien,  and I guess he was going through withdrawals cause he wasn't on the Ambien anymore.  I think that's how I read the story.  So he had to go to the emergency room for five hours or so.  Isn't Ambien stuff that makes you, uh, sleep?  Yeah.  That's it, right?  Well, he has insomnia.  Yeah.  So he needed something to fall asleep.  He was on the Ambien, and I guess he was going through some kind of withdrawal from his, 
[00:32:30]  uh, from the insomnia medication Ambien.  It made him jumpy.  So, uh, he went into the hospital, and when he returned home late in the day after a five-hour  visit to the emergency room, Weaver was shocked to find his poodles, Xavier, and Fifi missing.  Inquiries of neighbors led Weaver, a retiree, to believe that someone had let police from,  uh, this, let police from the 72nd precinct into his home, and that officers, for some 
[00:33:00]  reason, had removed the dogs from the apartment.  I went over to the precinct, uh, precinct, and they lied to me, Weaver told the Post.  They said they had nothing to do with it.  I went back around 1130 at night again, and one cop said, oh, we took those dogs.  We took them to a shelter.  A frantic Weaver had to wait until morning to find out through the city's 311 system,  where precisely the dogs had been taken.  You won't see those dogs no more.  When he was finally able to take his poodles back home, both seemed edgy and uncharacteristically 
[00:33:30]  aggressive, but a nastier surprise awaited when he got close to Xavier.  When he was lying over, I said, let me see your teeth.  And I said, whoa, when I saw he wasn't chewing bones the way he normally did, I ran my finger  along the gum line, and I saw that the teeth were just broken off.  Oh.  So he's claiming that the police knocked out his poodle's teeth.  If any dog should have its teeth knocked out, it is the poodle.  What a useless dog that is. 
[00:34:00]  That's terrific.  Every aunt I've ever had over the years growing up, all I can remember is a poodle named Fifi  or Peppy or some kind of frigging French name running around the house, stinking the joint  up.  Yeah.  Just getting the complete unconditional love of this old woman.  Enough with the poodle.  It's an old lady dog.  What's this guy doing?  Weaver said he believes that the five broken teeth were the result of a blow from a night  stick. 
[00:34:30]  Oof.  But he admits he can't be sure.  Oh.  Five broken teeth.  He thinks Xavier would have showed his teeth because he's like a guard dog even though he's  a poodle.  A poodle.  Can a poodle be a guard dog?  No.  No, they can't.  What these little dogs do is they're nasty.  They're nasty little dogs.  And they show their teeth for anything.  I used to have a little dog.  My sister had it.  I didn't have this dog.  My sister had a dog named Little Tiffany Tootles. 
[00:35:00]  The dog's name was Tiffany Tootles.  Ew.  And it was one of those Yorkshire Terriers.  They're cute.  They're adorable to smash against the wall.  They're little, little Yorkies.  And they're yappy dogs constantly.  Bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop.  And my sister was the only one that could control this thing.  If you tried to get near it, it would growl at you and snap at you like it was a pit bull.  Would Tiffany Tootles bite at you?  Little Tiffany Tootles. 
[00:35:30]  And Little Tiffy Tootles was so crazy.  Whenever there was a thunderstorm, the first clap of thunder, she would run into the bathtub and curl up on the drain and shake like Michael J. Fox.  Tiffany Tootles is a faggot.  Tiffany Tootles stunk.  That's wonderful.  Well, Weaver said a veterinarian has told him that.  Enthusiasm there.  That's wonderful.  That Xavier, moving on, will require several root canals, an expensive procedure that he said he can ill afford unless his suit bears fruit. 
[00:36:00]  He's already bearing fruit.  He's got a couple of poodles.  Whatever happened to Little Tiffany Tootles?  Tiffy's dead.  What happened?  I hope it was some horrific death.  No, I think it was just old age.  I don't know.  I was in California at the time or something.  Maybe not.  I don't remember.  All I know is there was a fun story one time when Joe and the neighbor boy were dealing in hashish. 
[00:36:30]  Tiffy got into one of the hash cubes and ate the whole thing.  And Dawn was very distressed that Tiffy was ill.  I bet you Tiffy turned into a slut.  No, Tiffy just turned into a...  The whole neighborhood got a turn.  No, it was a bag of dog.  It couldn't move.  It couldn't stand up.  Really?  It tried to walk and it would fall on its face.  And it was because we were smoking the hash that it ate. 
[00:37:00]  It was one of the funniest things you'd ever want to see.  It was a dog that ate a whole brick of hash.  But Dawn wasn't too happy about Little Tiffy Tootles being drugged.  Oh, God love her.  God love Little Tiffy Tootles.  I like to grab Tiffy Tootles by the neck and just punch it right in the face.  Well, someone wants to correct us on poodles.  It was one of the nervous dogs, too, Tiffy Tootles.  Of course it was.  You'd run up and go, Tiffy!  And Tiffy would freak out, roll over on her back, and just all over the carpet. 
[00:37:30]  Oh, she's excitable.  Little Tiffy's excitable.  The size of a Nerf football.  Just want to punt her.  Boom!  Right across the lawn.  Well, let's talk to Frank and Coram.  Frank?  Hey, Frank.  Hey, Frank.  What's up, One?  Hey.  Yeah, poodles are actually pretty big.  Those are big dogs.  Only the toy poodles are the small ones.  Those big, stupid-looking poodles where they shave them.  Yeah, those ones that they groom with those little puffs. 
[00:38:00]  And they put the two puffs by the ass of the poodle.  But nothing says gay like a poodle.  You got that right.  And they're nasty dogs, too.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, nasty.  Not if you got a nightstick.  You got that right.  Take a couple of teeth out.  They shut right up.  I guarantee that dog broke its teeth trying to bite its way out of its cage.  That could have happened, too.  Things not used to being caged.  All right, guys.  Caged enemy.  All right.  Thanks for the terrific.  Damn you.  Poor old knowledge. 
[00:38:30]  Matt, what's up?  Hey, yeah.  I just wanted to say that, you know, poodles are a owner friend.  You know, so they're only nasty if you're not their owner.  I love you, Johnny Cakes.  Yeah.  He's a fag.  Oh, you like that, don't you, faggot?  Matt, you love your poodle, do you?  No.  Dude, do you go, give me kisses? 
[00:39:00]  I personally love the sound they make when they hit the wall as well, but my wife does.  You know what poodles are great at?  Poodles are great at carrying medication up the steps in their teeth for their owner.  Can they balance broth on their head?  All right, let's go to Tony in Jersey.  Tony, what's up?  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Good morning.  Good morning.  Go fetch daddy's robe.  Daddy's too tired to get up.  Could you get the paper?  Tony, yes, go. 
[00:39:30]  I used to breed poodles, and now I'm a 6'3", 212-pound guy, a big guy, and everyone used  to make fun of me.  I used to use my dogs.  Those poodles were actually bred for hunting years ago, and they still have their hunting  instincts.  You can take them out into the woods, have them drive deer, and they would drive the deer  right to me every time.  Everyone with a poodle.  Everyone with a poodle's got to justify it by saying they're the toughest things that  ever walked through the face of the earth.  You know, a poodle once took down a Tyrannosaurus. 
[00:40:00]  Yeah.  Did it?  They drive deer to you, but if you bend over, guess what they drive to you?  I didn't say they were tough dogs.  I said they were intelligent dogs.  Ah, so they're smart, the poodle.  Correct.  And if you breed them right, they're not the little yappy, bite-your-ankle kind of  dogs.  My dogs never barked.  They never bit anybody.  What was the name of your poodle?  Believe it or not, the one that used to drive the deer, her name was Poochie.  Poochie.  See, they all get the little fruity names.  Peppy.  Nothing beats Tiffy Toodles. 
[00:40:30]  Little Tiffany Toodles.  Was little as part of it?  No, I used to call it Little Tiffy Toodles.  Well, that name's going to be on Wack Bag within a minute.  Tiffy Toodles.  Little Tiffy Toodles.  Tiffy Toodles, check it in.  All right, guys, punch it out.  Two damage, two damage to Tiffy Toodles.  Why have you struck me?  Because I hate Tiffy Toodles.  Tiffy Toodles would respond well when I would scratch her belly.  She would piddle. 
[00:41:00]  Tiffy Toodles would scream me in the mouth and nose when I'd scratch her belly.  I used to hate Tiffy Toodles.  Stupid Tiffy Toodles.  Where did she get the name from?  Dawn.  She was like a dopey kid.  It's pretty creative.  Tiffany Toodles.  It's faggy, but it's creative.  You know why she used to try to show these dogs?  Because she also had a Bichon Frise.  Yeah.  Named Rosie.  And so you have to give them these registered pedigree type names. 
[00:41:30]  And all of them have these long kind of names.  You can't just call it Tiffy.  Actually, I think the name was Tiffany Toodles, rah, rah, rah, was the actual registered name.  You got to have like a long name because there's a lot of dogs registered and they got to be different.  So I'm sure there was maybe another Tiffany Toodles out there.  So you got to add like rah, rah, rah at the end.  I got to cast this spell on you.  Where's my beanbag?  Don't hit me with a beanbag spell.  What, are you going to root me?  Or is it going to be a damaging spell? 
[00:42:00]  I would name my poodle William.  And then just name it one more William than the most they allowed.  Like this is William William, William, William, William.  Just be annoying.  Yeah.  Seven Williams in a row.  If you have a poodle, it should be named Robert Reed, rah, rah, rah.  No.  Robert Reed, boo-hoo-hoo.  Boo-hoo-hoo.  Let's go to Andy in Jersey.  A lot of calls from Jersey today.  Andy, what's up? 
[00:42:30]  Hey, good morning, boys.  Good morning, man.  I used to work for an air conditioning and heating company,  and I went out on a no-heat call late at night, like 1 o'clock in the morning,  and the lady had a little poodle that attacked me as I was coming up the stairs,  going up to my truck for something.  I whacked it in the head with a mag light, knocked it out.  The lady was screaming at my boss wanting me fired.  But that's that.  I seem to miss the point of his story.  Yeah.  I took two seconds away from paying attention to read something,  and I missed the entire point of his story. 
[00:43:00]  We'll just assume it sucked.  All right.  All right.  That story stunk.  Let's go to Jeremy in Pennsylvania.  Jeremy.  Hey, what's up?  Hey.  I want to tell Norton, awesome job in Delhi this weekend.  Great show.  Delhi, how was it?  Nice, man.  Yeah, nice.  Great place.  Nice crowd.  Thank you, man.  How long did it take to get up there?  Three hours.  Three hours back.  Forever, right?  Yeah, endless.  Me and Marina Franklin and Club Soda drove.  Marina? 
[00:43:30]  Yeah.  She is funny, man.  Yeah, she's really funny.  Yeah.  A black female comic.  She is funny.  Female comic funny?  Wow.  No, I'm telling you, she is funny, yeah.  Okay.  She's a very good actor.  Did she do all right?  Yeah, she killed.  Oh, cool.  Is it 18 degrees up there yet?  It is September.  It can't be.  I had to make an appearance.  Jesus Christ.  I had to wear my late show jacket.  It's freezing up there in September.  The end of September, forget about it.  It's snowing.  Upstate New York State.  I hate upstate.  Yeah.  Oh, do I hate upstate.  All right.  We've got to take a quick break.  Don't forget, the ONA Traveling Virus coming to Cleveland this coming Saturday. 
[00:44:00]  Are the tickets still $10?  I don't know.  Do we know?  Bud Light presents the Opie and Anthony Traveling Virus, the comedy event of 2006.  Coming soon to a venue near you.  No, it's coming to one last venue.  That's right.  And that is Saturday at Tower City Amphitheater in Cleveland, Ohio.  Tickets on sale now through all Ticketmaster locations.  It's all the comedians you know and love from this show.  Presented by Bud Light, always worth it.  The info is on opandathlete.com.  I don't know if they're selling $10 tickets anymore.  I have no idea.  I didn't get an update on that. 
[00:44:30]  We should have had an update.  Someone get us an update.  Are the tickets only $10 still?  Hopefully we'll find out and we'll let you know after the break.  If you throw a beanbag spell at you, it's a flaming spell, four damage.  What?  Yeah, you look out.  What?  It's a spell.  And that's four damage?  Better than the weapon you're wielding.  You're not even double dual wielding.  Plastic sword, two damage, two damage.  Ooh, my arm.  What's the highest damage you can do? 
[00:45:00]  It all depends on what geeky game you're playing.  Please, please tell us the answer.  I came in for some need.  So we can openly laugh at you.  I don't know about LARPing.  I know about EverQuest.  Barely.  I haven't played in a while, but I know now you could do some massive damage.  16,000.  All right.  We need to take a break.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  I saw Jay Moore was on the line and now he's not on the line.  Where'd he go?  He heard we had to take a break and hung up.  Maybe he'll call back after the break.  Maybe he'll do that.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America. 
[00:45:30]  Call the Opie and Anthony show right now.  866-313-FREE.  ONA, who's this?  Hi.  I'm Tony.  What do you got for the show?  Nothing.  So why'd you call?  The man on the radio said I should call.  Oh, fantastic.  Hang on.  If you have a point that's relevant to the topic at hand,  call the Opie and Anthony show.  at 866-313-FREE.  Okay, bye. 
[00:46:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  That's right.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  Forgot to tell people.  Jet Li stopping by to say hi today.  Ooh.  Also, Spike Ferriston.  He does a late night talk show, right?  I think so, yeah.  Saturday's been on the phone.  We'll learn about him today.  1-866-313-FREE is our phone number. 
[00:46:30]  1-866-313-FREE.  Believe it or not, it's a slow news day.  It really is.  Yeah, it happens.  Got some cute stories we could get into.  Cute.  Yeah, you know.  Oh, our definition of cute.  Which means horrifically horrible.  Shut up, you're going to ruin it.  Don't ruin it.  Two elderly women in Daytona, Florida,  are recovering today after some scary moments  trapped them inside their sweltering car.  Officials say the Cadillac's battery died  in yesterday's midday heat, 
[00:47:00]  and that knocked out the automatic locks.  After two hours, a passerby spotted  call 911 on the back of some tissue  in the window there and called police.  This woman were apparently unaware  that they could unlock those doors manually.  Fortunately, though, you see them being carried away  by EMS to get some treatment.  You stupid old bags.  All right, I was with the elderly women  for a second there.  There is not a car made that you can't just  unlock manually in some fashion.  So what do you think they were doing?  In way, shape, or form.  Being stupid old, don't know what modern machinery 
[00:47:30]  is like, people.  How would you unlock them if they locked  like the automatic locks?  I have no idea.  I mean, there's usually some kind of slide mechanism  on the door that unlocks your vehicle.  Ah, Stan's got info.  Stan?  Well, apparently they had to smash the window out  to get them out.  They did?  Yeah, whoever showed up, the police or whatever.  They still couldn't figure it out.  Because they couldn't figure it out.  They couldn't even describe it to them, I guess.  They had to smash the window to release them. 
[00:48:00]  How about, any news on what year the car was?  Yeah.  Is there an owner's manual in the glove box  that they could have maybe thumbed through  their old fingers, cataract-ridden eyes  trying to read?  I don't know, Martha.  I'm looking.  I can't find it.  It says the seats are leather,  and I'm baking.  Oh, what'd they get, the heat stroke?  A little of the heat stroke?  A little bit, a little bit. 
[00:48:30]  Poor old people.  I'll answer feedback.  I don't know what this means.  Frank from Jersey.  Hey, guys, just found out you guys have a Mac widget  for the live feedback.  Best download since Knife Girl.  Punch it out.  Yeah, widget.  You can go on your screen.  You can set up on the Mac.  You can set up widgets.  That's not what I don't get.  Why, yeah.  I don't get the part where it says  best download since Knife Girl.  Oh.  So he obviously saw something on one of our websites,  thinks it's terrific.  I guess he liked the Knife Girl video.  No, it says best download since Knife Girl.  Yeah, he enjoys the Knife Girl video. 
[00:49:00]  Yeah, maybe this is the best download since Knife Girl.  And now he enjoys this.  It's like the best thing since sliced bread.  Wait, he likes the Mac widget?  Best thing since.  Since?  Yeah.  What do you think if you're going to say  best download since Knife Girl,  it's another horrific thing we did on our show?  I think he's choosing a weird, different category.  It should be another application or something.  Best download since Microsoft Paint.  All right.  All right, I'm with you now. 
[00:49:30]  I didn't understand what that meant.  Yeah.  I thought he was talking about another video  or some horrific bit we did.  Nah.  But just that the Mac widget?  The widgets are so handy, man.  They really are.  You just pop up like 10 of them on your screen.  I have a bunch of them on mine.  Boom.  What's the widget?  You pop it up.  You know that little speedometer-like icon on there?  You pop up and then you download widgets from the Mac site.  And you can download, like, I have downloaded on mine The Weather, 
[00:50:00]  my local movie theater, and What's Playing.  Oh, wow.  Times in different countries and regions of the United States.  And it's just you pop them all up.  Boom.  They're up there on your screen.  You check them out.  Is that your dashboard?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, yeah.  The dashboard.  And one of the widgets is the ONA Instant Feedback widget.  And it pops up and all you have to do is type into it and send.  You don't have to go to any special website or anything.  Do you have a widget that lets you know where the next LARPing event is going to be? 
[00:50:30]  I wouldn't know.  Cast the spell.  Cast the spell.  Ah, you hit my arm.  What was that?  Oh, my God.  It was a freezing spell.  Oh, no.  I just cast the spell.  You've slowed me.  Now I cannot hit you as quickly.  Two damage.  Two damage.  Two damage.  I've been slowed.  I got a box of spells for the rest of the show.  Damn it.  Get me that spell because I need one.  This is a rooting spell.  What's a rooting spell? 
[00:51:00]  You'll be rooted.  You won't be able to move.  That's not nice.  It's a limited time thing, but at least you won't be able to move.  Can you cast a spell that makes me talk better?  No.  It's not a spell.  You really got to get a wizard's potion for that.  All right.  I get it.  Shut up.  You don't have to go with it that much.  Clay in Georgia.  Oh, man.  If you guys heard all the on-star calls that I get from old people locking themselves in their car,  if there wasn't some NDA on that, that would be the funniest radio, bar none. 
[00:51:30]  What does NDA mean?  Non-disclosure.  You can't.  Yeah, you can't be playing those.  You can't disclose it.  I don't know.  What if we just happened to get some of those calls sent to us?  Legally, what goes on at that point?  If you get an anonymous email attachment with some also screaming about how they're going  to roast to death, you won't know where it came from.  I'm trapped in my car.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  First thing you got to do, lady, is turn up the heat. 
[00:52:00]  Ah, well, why don't you just go along with it and do the bit I was going to do?  Punching out, fellas.  It's too late.  You took us all with you.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Let's say hi to Lee.  Very upset.  Lee, what's up?  Well, Lee.  Hey, what's going on, man?  Hey, man.  I fucking suck.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Hey, now I don't think we deserved that type of language, sir.  Yes, sir.  Why do we suck, Lee?  Come on. 
[00:52:30]  You're saying upstate sucks, right?  Wait, what part of upstate are you from?  I'm above Albany.  I happen to love upstate New York, I got to tell you.  I enjoyed my time mostly in Rochester, kind of like my time in Buffalo.  You know what?  Loved my time in Geneseo when I was going to college there.  I'll give you upstate when there's buildings perhaps taller than two stories.  Okay.  It's not about having buildings above two stories.  Don't you like the openness of upstate New York?  No.  Why?  It's old buildings.  Shut up, stupid. 
[00:53:00]  It's cold.  Yeah, then look at a tree.  It's foggy.  How can you see it?  It's cold and people are dopes.  You guys don't like nature?  No.  They all have stupid.  There's spandex tucked under their socks.  The chicks all wear flannel in August.  Oh, because it's freezing.  It's cold in upstate New York.  And there's eight billion antique shops if you want to go antiquing.  Exactly.  You don't like to watch the leaves change this time of year?  Oh, God.  Get a little apple cider in you?  Oh, do I want to throw this spell at you?  I'll spell you back.  I know.  You've got more spells than me. 
[00:53:30]  Oh, God.  No spells.  I've got spells that are as heavy as bricks.  Jesus.  That's a crack my nose spell.  You guys got to be D&D rejects, are you?  Lee, I like upstate New York.  I really do.  I like nature.  I like openness.  I get a little claustrophobic here in Manhattan.  By the way, the new motto for upstate New York.  Go ahead.  You talk.  Why would I try to put something funny when the boss is talking?  Go right ahead, boss.  Sorry, Lee.  I didn't mean to interrupt you with trying to be funny.  But no, go right ahead.  It's all about you.  Go ahead, Lee. 
[00:54:00]  Yeah, it is.  It is.  It is.  Anyway, so what are you telling me now?  Now you're one of them tree-hugging bunny fuckers?  See, I let you talk.  See?  What are you doing?  And you screwed it up.  Go ahead, Lee.  You talk.  You don't know how to talk on a regular radio.  And you blew it.  You failed miserably, Lee.  Didn't you?  And you have an echo like you're one of those oldie stations.  Don't just stare at it.  Eat it.  Hey, that's what it's supposed to be.  What were we trying to say, Lee?  One more try.  What?  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, you son of a bitch. 
[00:54:30]  What, Lee?  Lee?  Yes?  I don't get it.  Now he's calling me a tree-hugger?  What is that?  What do you mean?  Like, you're not making any sense.  Yeah, we said we didn't like Upstate.  Why are you saying that, Lee?  And that Upstate sucks.  Right.  And now because you have somebody confronting you on it.  Oh, my God.  Lee could be the dumbest caller ever.  Lee, I hope he was agreeing with you because I lived up there for many years and I do like Upstate New York.  There's still two people in studio that hate Upstate New York. 
[00:55:00]  What do you think, Lee?  When one person says something in this studio, all of us agree with it.  I said I hate Upstate.  And then someone confronts you and all of a sudden you turn and say that you'll like it.  And then Opie said he liked Upstate and I still say Upstate sucks.  I've always liked Upstate New York.  I thought I was talking to the dumbass who said he didn't like Upstate New York.  I don't like the weather up there and I'll never like the weather up there, so shut up, stupid.  I hated Lee more than Tiffany Tootles. 
[00:55:30]  I thought it was Tiffy Tootles.  It was Tiffy for short.  Tiffy for short.  I wanted to hit him.  Oh, he's ready to throw a spell at me.  Yes, I am.  I'll throw one back.  I got one.  Two damage!  Two damage!  That's the dumbest thing.  Gotta get some magic to your spells.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Do I.  Like the slowing spell. 
[00:56:00]  See, then I could hit you with it.  Yeah.  And then you couldn't go, two damage, two damage, you would go, two damage, two damage.  Like you'd have to slow down.  They don't do that, do they?  They would have to.  It's a slowing spell, you moron.  Of course they would.  Do they have a...  You sound silly now.  Do they have a...  Oh, sneeze spell.  I'll hit a...  Ah, my sneeze spell worked.  I wonder if LARPers have a...  We're not faggot spell.  No.  They try to cast on each other.  It's not been invented. 
[00:56:30]  Yeah.  It's administered on the tip of something.  I'm sure that spell never hits its mark.  That always misses.  See, now everyone that loves us from upstate New York is mad.  Too bad to light up this state.  Oh, stop.  You know it's awful up there.  Every time I've driven through your dumb part of the state, I have hit drizzle and fog.  Every time I drive through the stupid upstate New York mountains to do a gig, and I've done hundreds, it's fog.  I have never once in any time of year just driven upstate New York and remarked, what a lovely evening for a drive. 
[00:57:00]  You don't like looking at the scenery.  You don't like going for a little nature hike.  No more than I like...  Maybe check out a little waterfall.  I also don't like doing two miles an hour.  Maybe.  They have no guardrails.  Those cheapskates up there have three little strings.  Oh, I know.  Isn't that awful?  From plummeting to your death.  Maybe stop at a farm stand and get some fresh fruit and vegetables to take back to New York.  No.  Nothing?  No.  Maybe a fresh apple pie.  Nothing.  Made by the locals.  Hey, you could get one at the supermarket.  Oh, you guys are boring.  You know something? 
[00:57:30]  No, I don't like upstate New York's weather.  It stinks.  It's horrid.  My girlfriend's family is up there in a place called Andy's.  Oh, right, right.  I can't do the show, yeah.  Andy's, New York.  It is this little, you could drive through it in two minutes at maybe two miles an hour.  Yeah.  Believe me.  It is the smallest little town.  And it is just antique stores and freezing cold weather in September.  That's it.  I go up there.  You drive up.  You figure all you need is like a light shirt. 
[00:58:00]  And by the time you get there, you can't even leave the vehicle.  It's freezing cold.  Why the hell would I want to go up there?  Did you stay up there?  I did a few times.  I don't like it.  I don't either.  You know what?  Someone is pointing out something interesting.  Peter from Long Island.  Anyone there noticed that Opie, who lives in Manhattan, loves outdoors?  And Anthony, who lives in the suburbs, wants the tall buildings?  No, I don't want the tall buildings.  Oh, I would love to live in the suburbs.  But the commute around New York City is just ridiculous.  You know, Friday, I went out to Long Island to go eat at my brother's restaurant, FH Riley's, 400 New York Avenue, in the heart of Huntington Village. 
[00:58:30]  I left at 3.30 on Friday, which was stupid, a little too late.  I understand, a little too late.  But manageable, right?  Yeah.  Three hours to Huntington.  Three hours plus to Huntington.  It was bumper to bumper from my apartment all the way to Huntington.  There's no good way to get out to Long Island.  It's in the – I actually almost cried one time when the L.I.E. traffic was so – it will remove any masculinity you have. 
[00:59:00]  Yeah.  I said that last night.  I got onto the expressway and hit taillights, and I just went to my girlfriend.  I went, I'm going to cry.  I'm going to cry.  It does.  It removes all masculinity from you whatsoever.  Everywhere you go on the stupid island.  That's why I hate Long Island, because there's no way to get out there without hitting bumper to bumper traffic.  Yeah.  But, you know, the politicians, you got to get the violent video games out of the kids' hands, because that's really important. 
[00:59:30]  Can't figure out how to make it easier to commute.  Well, they don't want to take on the real issues.  No.  They never want to take on the real issues, so let's go for the really easy, soft targets.  Easy ones.  You know, you want my vote?  Try to figure out how to get to Huntington in less than an hour.  It should be a 40-minute ride.  It should be a 40-minute ride.  Three hours.  And I'm talking an hour on a slow day that's not rush hour traffic. 
[01:00:00]  Yeah.  Rush hour guaranteed two hours minimum.  Why don't you take on that topic?  Throw in an accident?  Forget about it.  You're cooked.  Politicians, they stink.  Oh, I know.  Well, in handcuffs and placed in the back of a deputy's car is how Jamal Williams ended a morning that began with the carjacking of an elderly couple's car, according to authorities.  Get a job.  I got one.  It's taking a white people's cars like yours.  At about 10 this morning, an elderly couple that wished to not be identified was at Murphy's Gas Station in Melbourne when a man pointed a gun at them, demanded their 2006 Silver Chevy Impala, and then drove off with it. 
[01:00:30]  The couple immediately called 911, and with the help of the car's OnStar system, police were able to track the car and suspect down in Cocoa.  And when we caught up with the suspect, he said he'd target senior citizens.  So I'm thinking of a little old lady, any old lady, any, any.  Police also located on the roof of the apartment complex, Williams allegedly tried to hide in after abandoning the stolen Chevy Impala. 
[01:01:00]  And Williams is now in the Brevard County Jail, charged with carjacking, drug possession, and for violating his probation.  Uh, where's the hate crime?  Where's the mother-effing hate crime he should be charged with for targeting white people?  I thought of that.  My only guess is because it wasn't a violent crime.  What?  I mean, I'm just...  Was it a carjacking?  Plus, it's a violent crime.  Black people with carjacking.  Carjacking is a violent crime. 
[01:01:30]  It's traumatic.  I agree.  It's violent.  It's abusive.  It's an assault.  That should be a hate crime.  He is targeting people based on their race.  Just kidding.  I've had it.  Oh, God, have I had it.  He said his job is taking white people's cars.  Taking white people's cars.  There you go.  There you go.  There you go.  And our job is taking black people's freedom.  There you go.  Bye-bye.  Have fun. 
[01:02:00]  Hope your little jokes and gags work good in the joint, my friend.  And I use the joint to be cool.  I say the joint.  That's right.  I say in the can or the pokey.  That's a little pokey.  When I'm talking to chicks, I say that.  God, I'm sick of it.  Can we get a little civilization in this world, please?  Or at least in this country.  I don't care what happens in the rest of the world.  All the violence, the better in the rest of the world.  Just build a wall.  A big wall of anti-violence. 
[01:02:30]  That's right.  The second you act up, boom, gone.  Over the wall.  Start swimming.  I want to be surrounded by lilacs.  Yes.  That's my dream.  Nice smelling.  Yeah.  Flowers.  God, I've had it.  We got to coddle too much.  Don't get me started on that friggin' the pope statement.  Well, he apologized because, you know, Muslim clerics always apologize after they say something.  And immediately, you know, Christians and Jews run out and murder, you know, Muslim women, of course. 
[01:03:00]  You know, they just shot a nun because of something the pope said.  It's just a lovely group.  You're a lovely group of people and that's what you are.  Yeah.  That murder of that nun is what you are.  It cements what the pope was – didn't even say, by the way.  He was quoting something from friggin' 8 billion years ago.  Boy, they're sensitive.  There's just no – there's no peaceful disagreement in Islam. 
[01:03:30]  No.  There's no ability to not set fires to effigies.  It's an effigy.  Is it?  Yeah.  That's what you do.  Stomping on flaming flags and effigies and just staring into cameras, making faces that I swear you'd only see in a zoo.  I swear to you, you'd only see if you left an animal starving and then threw a piece of meat at them. 
[01:04:00]  And then they shot a nun.  And, yeah, they shoot a nun to show how – what the pope said about them being violent and –  They're lovely people.  That's a good way to show how nonviolent you are by shooting a nun.  There you go.  Here's the story.  Reactions to the pope's apology have led Italian police to tighten security of potential Catholic targets across the country.  Meanwhile, Vatican officials are saying they hope this wave of hatred does not result in grave consequences.  Hope you surf on any waves of hatred? 
[01:04:30]  There are no signs that protest and anger around the world is abating, even after an extraordinary personal apology from Pope Benedict.  Appearing at the summer papal palace, the pope said he was deeply sorry and that he meant only to inspire an interfaith debate.  A former deputy of the Sunni Arab world's most powerful institution said the pope's comments were a clear and direct insult to Islam. 
[01:05:00]  Others have said a full retraction is needed.  There you go.  Lovely religion.  Isn't it?  Lovely.  That's the way the modern civilized world handles problems.  We set things on fire and jump up and down on them like we're in the opening scene of 2001, a space odyssey.  Lovely group of human beings shooting a nun.  How does it end?  How does it end, Jimmy?  How does this whole thing play out?  It doesn't.  With the destruction of the world?  No, I don't think it's anything that melodramatic.  I think we just –  I'm not saying now.  Charlton Heston gets shot and hits the atomic bomb button. 
[01:05:30]  I'm saying down the road.  I don't know, man.  A few generations from now is it the end of the world?  Who wins this one?  Someone's got to win.  Whether it ends or not, someone's got to win.  Do we win?  Do the Muslims win?  I hope it's like the Buddhists or the Hindus or somebody who's pretending to be peaceful,  but the whole time they've been working on a bomb.  Now that would be trickery.  I hope it's the Buddhists and they've been working – like all those dumb clocks in  the stomachs have bombs.  The little A-bombs.  That's why their stomach's so round. 
[01:06:00]  You think it's going to just –  To fit the nuclear core.  You think it's going to end in like a round-robin tournament?  Jesus, Mohammed, Buddha.  Just kicking ass.  Get them all together.  They have such this thing for their religion, this passion.  I don't even want to call it a passion because you've got to be passionate about it.  It's not passion.  It's savage.  It's savage rage.  It's an insanity.  It's a cult.  The guy Van Gogh, one of Van Gogh's relatives, did an unpopular – not a favorable play  about Muslims, where they treat their women in Denmark. 
[01:06:30]  How was it reviewed?  Well, they gave it a negative review.  I don't know.  I think it was a nine-bullet, one-knife review, which is – according to Rotten Tomatoes  is not good.  Right.  And the guy did it, of course, because that's what – I guess when you're in that religion  and that's what you're a healthy Muslim, that's what you do.  I don't know.  But that apparently is the way they solve all our religious disagreements.  See, their religion apparently is that you cannot in any way criticize their religion.  Right.  If you do, the penalty is death. 
[01:07:00]  That's a real nice, peaceful – but they say it's a peaceful religion.  But there's no open – there's no debate.  There's no dialogue with these people about religion.  It's their way or you are put to death.  We got more.  So how the hell do you then talk to them about this?  You don't.  You don't?  There's more on the story.  The comments came in a speech the Pope made last week at Regensburg University in Germany. 
[01:07:30]  I think it's going to take years for the damage done to Christian-Muslim relations to be repaired.  This came out as jihad.  Like it was good.  The Pope, who is said to write all of his own speeches, quoted a 14th century emperor.  He said the prophet Muhammad brought nothing but evil and inhumane things to the world.  Pope Benedict went on to criticize jihad and holy war, suggesting it flies in the face of God.  As news spread, so did the violence. 
[01:08:00]  He's got great timing, huh?  In Somalia, where an Italian nun was gunned down to the West Bank, where as many as five churches were burned.  Yeah, burned churches.  In addition to the anger in the Muslim world, there has been a complicated debate in Italy among Catholics,  many of whom question whether Pope Benedict appreciates the reaction he got to his comments  and whether the Vatican should have more power to veto what the Pope says in public.  Veto what the Pope?  Why should they veto it?  Because these savages can't handle criticism.  Why?  God almighty, we finished. 
[01:08:30]  The whole world is supposed to bend over backwards and walk on eggshells  because some people cannot handle being criticized or disagreed with.  First of all, the Pope's infallible, so it's right.  Whatever he says is right.  And why would anybody listen to me?  That's the other part of my point.  Who cares what he says?  He's an older man with a stupid hat.  Who cares what the Pope says?  When was the last time the Pope was relevant? 
[01:09:00]  Just nonsense.  His stupid statements and his even dumber apology, and they're awful.  The whole thing just sucks.  Bill and Waterford.  Oh, Bill.  Jesus versus Muhammad in a LARPing match.  A LARPing?  Jesus can cast better spells.  You think?  You think that Muhammad?  Come on.  Muhammad needs a bunch of savages.  You do two damage, two damage, and he just lops your head off.  Jesus showed some good things he could do for people, but I'm sure if he gets a little aggravated, 
[01:09:30]  he's not turning water into wine.  Turning it into napalm.  Or acid or something.  Acid, something very damaging.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Two damage.  All right.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  Yeah.  We'll do it later.  I know the Pope is German and not Italian.  I said Mamma Mia because he's in Italy.  The Vatican.  So the Vatican's in Italy, and they're speaking Italian.  You dope.  You don't think I know the Pope is in the Hitler Youth?  It's the first thing I learned about him. 
[01:10:00]  I had more than my share of him as well.  The Pope.  Enough already.  All right.  When we get back, we'll do something.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  It seems like every hole in my body is exploding every liquid imaginable.  Our adult fantasy playroom is open.  Opie and Anthony.  I'm scared.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:10:30]  Rolling right along here.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  Really fast.  The football picks are sponsored by Dish Network.  More football for you.  Better TV for all.  Call 1-888-GET-DISH.  And we'll give you this week's results tomorrow because we've got one more game tonight.  Right?  All right.  Our phone number is 1-866-313-FREE. 
[01:11:00]  We've got to say hi to Spike.  Spike, how do you say your last name?  Thurston?  Thurston.  All right.  I was going to get it right.  Thurston like the number.  You look younger in person than you do in your picture.  Yeah, I look about 12.  Yeah, that's really it.  The picture, you look like you're an older gentleman.  That's the hermaphrodite picture.  You can't see it at home, but that's what we call the hermaphrodite picture.  Wow.  Gender-neutral kind of a...  Gender-neutral, terrible fox picture.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You really can't tell.  I mean, you kind of figure it's a guy, but it could be a really awful woman in the  party. 
[01:11:30]  Yeah, publicity shots suck.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Wow, that one.  Yeah, because you look like just a regular guy.  I'm a regular guy.  That's the picture that makes people hate me, right there.  Yeah, you look like that young executive that comes up and tells you he's taken your job.  Yeah, that's exactly it.  Ooh.  So you're primarily a writer, right?  Like, that's your gig, basically.  You mostly write.  Yeah.  Yeah, I wrote on David Letterman for about five years and then on Seinfeld after that.  Yeah, and this is... 
[01:12:00]  Ooh.  Wow.  That's the most famous episode.  There is a nice gig.  Which one?  What's that?  Which one did you write?  The Soup Nazi.  It was the first episode that I wrote.  No kidding.  Really?  You know, the real guy's going to be advertising on our show soon?  No kidding.  Al Yegana.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's got 200 restaurants.  That's right.  Yeah.  Guess how much I get from that?  Nothing.  Zero.  Zero.  He doesn't like Jerry or anybody that much.  Yeah, well, you know, he's like most people.  He took exception to being called a Nazi.  Yeah, wow.  Some people don't mind. 
[01:12:30]  He happened to mind.  But it made his business great.  I mean, is he really pissed off about the episode or is this all talk?  I brought Jerry there a year later because we would come here before the Seinfeld season  started to sort of soak up the city and I brought Jerry down because he thought the same  thing and the guy did a triple take flow of expletives flying out of his mouth before  he said no soup for you and then get the F out of here.  Come on.  He did.  He's not happy about it. 
[01:13:00]  Wow.  He feels that the.  But he's now franchised because of Seinfeld.  He doesn't see it that way.  Again, he saw himself called a Nazi.  Yeah.  And he's really upset by it.  Wow.  Yeah.  I wish he wasn't going to advertise on this show.  I'd really bash him.  But he seemed like a good fellow.  See, this is it.  The soup is great.  Yeah.  We had the soup recently and you got it.  I got to admit, it's terrific.  Yeah.  The soup is great.  We want to get him on the show.  Yeah.  I want to get to the bottom of this because I'm not buying into it.  Yeah. 
[01:13:30]  Go ahead.  Because he is huge because of this episode.  Go ahead.  Talk to him.  Yeah.  They all say that too.  They say he's not a nice guy.  He's not.  Makes great soup, but he's not a nice guy.  He didn't like being called a Nazi because it was too soft a title.  I thought it wasn't strong enough.  That's what I loved about that show, though, was the darkness of it.  A lot of people look at it as this light comedy, comic fare.  And in so many episodes, there's just this darkness.  And just the use, yeah, the word Nazi, like that, is like soup Nazi. 
[01:14:00]  And so many episodes, because I've been getting all the box sets and watching all the behind  and the scenes stuff, and how many episodes take place in hospitals under tragic circumstances.  Didn't one of Jason Alexander's girlfriend just something die in one of the episodes?  Oh, yeah.  His fiancée, yeah.  Yeah, that's right.  He just left.  He didn't care.  He swiped for his character.  People were very upset about that.  Really?  Very upset.  Yeah, they cared for her.  You know, they care for these TV characters.  And it was taken so lightly.  That's right for you now, Jim.  Yeah, but they never, I don't know. 
[01:14:30]  They just.  My wife is crazy about you.  He says wife's a fan, which has made me kind of happy.  Of Lucky Louie, that's great.  I have a pretty little wife, blonde wife.  She doesn't like to swear, doesn't like, she comes, she sits down, she watches the show  every week.  She goes, I like that guy.  He is so funny.  That's nice.  James.  Yes.  That's old Jimmy Norton.  Teehee.  Coming up.  He's coming up.  Yeah, but everything else I audition for, I stink on.  They basically just have to film me just being insulting and kind of vulgar.  And I'm okay, but it's only just like, you show some personality that's not that I'm 
[01:15:00]  awful.  Or your sensitive side.  Yeah, I don't have one.  Creepy.  You do.  Maybe.  Jimmy's very sensitive.  Girls like you.  So what's the talk show about?  Until they get the test results.  The talk show is a little half hour talk show, Saturday night's midnight after Mad TV.  You know, I'm just trying to do things a little differently.  And, you know, pulled a lot of the talk out of it.  Just doing a lot of jokes.  Just a little place, you know, get a little real estate.  Just want to have some fun.  Want people to laugh.  They said no monologue, right?  You know, you don't know. 
[01:15:30]  Yeah, I can't do that.  I don't know how to do a monologue.  So how does it open up?  You're just sitting at the desk?  I sit behind the desk.  I talk for a second.  And then I throw to the first piece.  Generally.  Nice.  Just simple.  Nice.  Live audience stuff.  And then the pieces are shown in front of a live audience.  Yeah, that's right.  It's sort of like, you know, that part of a talk show after the monologue and right  before the first guest comes out where all the comedy sits.  That's sort of the whole show.  That's what we're trying to do.  But, you know, we just have a tiny staff.  We have four writers.  That's a great idea because that's a lot of the parts of talk shows that I just watch. 
[01:16:00]  Like Conan.  Yeah.  He'll come on.  He'll do a monologue.  Sit down.  And then that's kind of my favorite part of the show.  And then the guests come out and you kind of, you know, turn the channel sometimes.  Yeah.  When they're doing those little comedy bits in between, so that's going to be your show?  That's what we're doing for now.  Yeah.  It's Saturday night.  No guests?  No, we have a guest.  Yeah.  Oh, you do?  We had Andy Richter on last week.  I think Mary Lynn Rice Cub's coming up.  We're shooting a show with Jerry.  Jerry Seinfeld's coming on. 
[01:16:30]  Oh, Jerry.  He's going to do something funny, hopefully.  You're praying.  And I say that because he's very funny.  I just haven't written anything yet for him.  I've got to get back and do that.  How long did you write for, how many, like, Seinfeld episodes did you write?  How long did you actually write for this show?  It was the last three years.  Seven, eight, and nine.  Wow.  I wrote the one where Elaine dances.  Oh, another classic.  The little cakes.  And the muffin top.  Muffin.  You know, it was.  Like, I'm just laughing at the titles.  I'm like, the muffin top, son of a bitch. 
[01:17:00]  That's great.  That was a lady that was actually based on a girlfriend that I knew here in New York  who only ate the tops of muffins and then wanted to open up her own shop.  See, most people just take that as like, nah, this is crazy broad.  Yeah.  And you see it as, let me write that as a show.  No, we were out of ideas that day.  What do you got?  This girl, muffins.  It was exactly that.  That's how I pitched it.  Yeah.  This girl who used to only eat the tops of muffins, she wants to open up a muffin top shop. 
[01:17:30]  And that was it.  We shot it two days later.  Have any shops opened up?  You would think someone would have done it just for the hell of a now.  I'm just in the business of getting people to open shops up, aren't I?  Well, it worked for the Soup Nazi, so I'm thinking there's got to be somewhere on a shop where you just get the tops of muffins.  Of course, the Kramer tour is also another one.  Yeah.  That was on an episode and then ended up.  It will be based on my talk show.  Some sort of pretzel rod endeavor or something.  Yeah, you have started a few food franchises.  Yeah. 
[01:18:00]  Well, and you get nothing for that.  Nothing.  Absolutely nothing.  It's going to be nice to be tied into a show with such a history like that, man.  It's like 30 years from now.  It's like looking back on MASH or any of those other shows, you're tied into one of the greatest shows ever done.  That's going to be real nice.  Yeah, it's good.  And, you know, by then I'll be getting those 39-cent checks coming in by the fistful.  Well, by season seven, you guys must have – I mean, sure, the deal's for you.  Like the honeymoon, the only one that got residuals was like Joyce Randolph. 
[01:18:30]  Yeah, yeah, right.  No one else got them because they didn't know anything about residuals back then.  But by the time he signed on season seven to Seinfeld, they had an idea that residuals would probably be smart.  This, I think, is going to be big.  Yeah.  It's going to be a big show.  It was so much fun to work on, too.  I mean, it's just a compliment to Jerry.  It was just a nice place to work and a fun place to work.  I've met him a few times.  I don't know him well.  I've gotten to know him a little bit.  He's kind of scary, man, because he's really honest.  Like one of my favorite Seinfeld moments, and it was just some fan wanted to take a picture with him at the Comedy Cellar. 
[01:19:00]  And Jerry said, all right.  And he stopped, and the guy went to put his arm around Jerry, and Jerry goes, we don't know each other.  We don't need to touch.  And I'm like, that guy –  And he meant it, by the way.  He wasn't trying to make a joke.  He wasn't being a dick.  Right, right.  He was just saying –  We laughed so hard.  I want to make sure people realize –  I want to make sure people touching you.  Yeah.  You let people touch you?  No.  Yeah, I would, though, because I'm such an approval-seeking worm.  I was like, okay, would you like this show?  I'm such a fag.  He was so brutally honest, man. 
[01:19:30]  That's one of the things that's really frightening about him is you knew if he didn't want to talk to you,  he would literally just look at you and walk away.  You think he'll ever do another TV show, TV series, I should say?  Oh, I don't think so.  I don't know.  You think he's just completely done?  I would guess.  You don't think creatively he's like jonesing to get back on TV to do something?  Well, he's performing every weekend.  Yeah.  And that satisfies that urge, I think, for him?  He's got a movie coming out, a B-movie.  Now I'm plugging Jerry right now.  Yeah.  I'm sorry.  That's all right.  But, yeah, he's pretty busy.  I don't know.  Have him on. 
[01:20:00]  Bring him on.  Yeah.  Let's go to Steve in Boston.  Steve, what's up?  Oi, boys.  Yeah.  I've seen the show Saturday night.  I just want to say I liked it.  It's a little different.  It was quick, you know, but everything was bunched into one show.  All right, Steve, two things.  Why did you like it?  And what did you like about it?  I flip it on the channels.  I said, who is this mate, man?  And I just said, it was just different.  It wasn't the same old monologue, like you said, at the beginning.  It just went right into the funny stuff there. 
[01:20:30]  And I enjoyed it.  Oh, thank you.  One for the Gaza Boys, yeah.  For the Gaza Boys?  Yeah, well, just my old crew about in London.  Of course it is.  Bunch of soccer hooligans.  Yeah, you know.  This is my audience, by the way.  It's a stoner set.  This is who's watching Saturdays at Midnight on Fox.  English stoners.  English stoners.  That's a weird time slot.  I mean, it's hard because it's not like a common time people watch TV, but it's got  to be good for content because you could probably get away with a lot more than you would under 
[01:21:00]  normal circumstances.  Yeah, I was very surprised at what was in what we got away with in that cold open with  did you see the axe handle thing?  We did this thing.  It was like a play on the old Ed Ames Tomahawk show.  Right.  Yeah, it was this fake Fox curse and this fake talk show host Donnie Riffle.  Donnie, instead of walking up and saying something clever, he just goes up to the axe handle  and starts jerking it off and tickling under here.  And then he goes off in the air and that began the Fox curse. 
[01:21:30]  Oh, is that great?  And they just aired it.  I mean, everything else gets cut out of the show.  And this, he's doing this.  You can't see that at home, but he's tickling underneath.  For anyone that doesn't understand what Spike's talking about, the famous, Ed Ames his name  was, right?  Right.  He was...  Carson.  Yeah, he was on Johnny Carson in the 60s and he was throwing a tomahawk and he threw it  at like a...  Was it a silhouette?  It was a silhouette.  A silhouette of a cowboy, right?  On a piece of wood or board and he threw it and the tip of the axe went right into the  groin of the silhouette. 
[01:22:00]  It's one of the funniest moments in front of television.  Screams.  And he went to take it out and Carson was so brilliant because he stopped him.  He just knew this is never going to not be funny.  And of course, of course, I'm proud of you.  What did he say?  I didn't even know you were Jewish.  Didn't even know you were Jewish.  That's right.  Gusting laugh.  We did the same thing.  He stopped him because he knew it and then he started swearing.  You hit him right in the...  Yeah.  And then I guess on Spike's version, they grabbed the handle and began tugging on the handle  back and forth. 
[01:22:30]  And that began the Fox curse and, you know, I'm the latest victim.  I like any show that, like, begins with a reference to that moment.  Yeah.  It's such an older, like...  Yeah, yeah.  The kids love it.  The kids really love old Carson references.  Yeah, right?  It is an odd place to go.  But, you know, I've always found it's better to really smack a few people right between the  eyes than try to appeal to the masses anyway.  You know, if people feel they're in on the joke and other people aren't getting it, I think 
[01:23:00]  that's really good stuff, really funny.  And I think it goes a lot further than, you know, that same old, oh, here it comes again.  But everyone, oh, look at all the house moms, the soccer moms, they're all laughing at it,  you know?  Right.  That stuff you can flush.  Get rid of it.  I like a reference that only a few people get.  That's what this show's all about.  Yeah.  Anthony loves his TV.  He's ridiculous with the things he remembers from TV.  Born and raised, right in front of it. 
[01:23:30]  That was my babysitter, my life.  Yeah, that was it.  I mean, commercials.  I'll sit there and just go, taste me, taste me.  Come on and taste me.  Take a puff and let me do my stuff.  Sing old cigarette jingles that just are in my head.  Why?  I have no idea.  I don't know.  They were just, I saw them a thousand times.  And funny stuff from like old, early 70s commercials in television.  Parodies on that.  That's what we're doing.  Crack me up.  Love it.  We're going to do that now.  I'm going to do that for you.  Just do those. 
[01:24:00]  Just for me.  I need some ideas.  This is for Anthony.  That's it.  Yeah.  Old 70s commercials.  Do the show for Anthony.  Because I have noticed a lot of people my age, they do relate to that and laugh at it.  There's a lot of funny stuff that's popping up on the internet that I see a lot of people  more, you know, as we get older, you know, and you guys pop on TV, that's what people  want to see.  Do you have a performer background at all, too?  Because like, it's hard to go from writing to performing.  I mean, Conan did it.  Yeah.  He was a writer for a long time. 
[01:24:30]  I mean, or.  Well, he wanted to be Hendrix.  I wanted to be Jimmy Hendrix.  Now you're reading the bio.  Yeah.  No, I actually thought I was Jimmy Hendrix.  Wow.  It's a music school.  Were you really good when you were very young?  I really thought I was good.  Right.  And I wasn't.  When did you realize you weren't?  Three years in to Berklee College of Music.  Wow.  So you, all right, growing up, you're like, I think I'm as good as Jimmy Hendrix.  I got to go to school for this.  I'm in a small town in Massachusetts, right?  I'm playing guitar.  The girls will love me.  And I'm like, you know what?  I'm just going to keep doing this.  This works.  I'm not getting beat up anymore. 
[01:25:00]  People are giving me, you know, beer, party.  This is fantastic.  I'm just going to go to music school and do this.  And I get there, and it's a disaster.  I don't know how to do it.  Were you up with your better musicians?  I'm playing with two fingers like Django Reinhardt.  I don't know what I'm doing.  Is that what it was?  You saw better musicians at Berklee, and you're like, oh.  No, I saw actual musicians.  I'm telling you.  Damn.  I saw real musicians.  And I didn't know what I'm doing.  And, you know, this is where TV came in.  Like, three years later, I'm like drunk one night on a Saturday night and decide to throw  fluorescent light bulbs out a window.  You know Mass Ave there in Boston? 
[01:25:30]  Sure.  Eight stories up, throwing fluorescent light bulbs out.  I almost hit somebody, and I get thrown out of the dorms.  And then, I think it was two or three weeks later, I saw Letterman doing it on TV, and  I'm like, God, he's getting paid for this, and he's on network television.  Maybe there's a place for me.  Yeah.  And then...  How do you make the jump?  Through a cocktail waitress, is how it happened.  What?  I was wearing...  I was bartending at the time.  He was making deals with cocktail waitresses two at a time.  Players couldn't get fluorescent light to the table.  Yeah, there was this cocktail waitress who walked into the bar I was bartending at, wearing 
[01:26:00]  that yellow-sleeved Letterman jacket, and she hooked me up with an internship, and I  would commute into New York once a week, sleep on my friend's floors, and, you know, do  an internship at SNL and Letterman, and just worm my way in from there.  That's awesome.  That's pretty cool.  And there you go.  You wrote one of the most famous episodes ever shot in a sitcom.  Yeah.  Pretty impressive, man.  Well, I had some help from Larry and Jerry.  I'd like to even get in that position. 
[01:26:30]  It's just amazing.  Isn't it amazing how much luck is involved in this crap?  Yeah, there really is.  No, you're right.  You're not...  Like, once you get in, you've got to perform.  You've got to...  You know, once your foot's in the door and stuff, you've got to prove yourself.  But the actual act of getting in the door usually turns out to be something really stupid  and just dumb luck.  No.  Pure dumb luck.  Pure dumb luck.  Pure dumb luck.  It really is.  And here I am again, and that's how I feel with this show.  Like, there's no reason that I should have my own show. 
[01:27:00]  Yeah.  Just because I want to do it.  Well, everybody...  A lot of people want to do it.  A lot of people want, yeah.  How the hell did that happen?  Like, a lot of people threw things out their dorm windows.  Yeah.  And I just got lucky again.  Yeah.  You know, I got really lucky, and I got some good people working for me, so...  That's great.  But I do have to learn how to do it now, and that's where the fun comes in.  Well, again, to bring up someone like Conan, early on, a lot of people were pretty skeptical  as to what his success would be, and now he's, you know... 
[01:27:30]  He's funny.  He had a really funny show.  Yeah.  You know, always did.  I always liked him.  Aside from Seinfeld, what do you look at as, like, writing-wise, old sitcoms, one of the best?  What would you say?  For old sitcoms...  Like, you look at, like, when you write something, like, I'll look at jokes, and then I'll watch  Woody Allen, and I just want to cut my own throat, because I'm like, that's what a great  comic does.  Right.  I'm a chimp.  Right.  Is there any, like, writers or shows you look at, and you go, man, that's what brilliant  writing is for a sitcom?  Well, for a sitcom, I mean, I don't know.  Some of the older ones, I don't know. 
[01:28:00]  It's like MASH, and, you know, Mary Tyler Moore, I'll watch All in the Family.  You know, All in the Family really resonates with me a lot, too, just because of what it  was, when it was, you know, when it was written, and what was being said.  And, of course, the earlier ones.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The later ones, they always wind up screwing things up.  Yeah.  It got good when Stephanie got there.  Oh.  Yeah.  All in the Family.  God.  I know, when he adopted the little girl, and he decided not to be a bigot anymore.  But not to keep kissing your ass, I was really excited when I saw your show, because I thought,  here's somebody, and, you know, I know Louie, and I'm a big fan of his, but I just thought, 
[01:28:30]  you guys, now, finally, somebody's doing something different, and now we don't know where  we are, and it is, and it's hilarious and odd at the same time.  What a great place to be in.  And that was the last time I was sort of like a little flipped out, where I thought, these  guys have got something.  The one thing I thought about the show, and still think about it, is an updated version  of the Honeymooners.  Yeah.  I mean, it's that same, you know, almost depressing feel when they're in their apartment.  You kind of look like, oh, this poor bastard. 
[01:29:00]  Well, the period, you know, knowing Louie and knowing what he was trying to do, and just  the way he was shooting it, and the way the sets were, and the jokes, and the stories,  all of it, it was just, I couldn't stop watching it.  It was very compelling.  And you're saying how women, you know, are attracted to the show.  The same way, though, the Honeymooners would, because she'd usually get the last word, you  know.  No one's putting one over on the wife in there.  It's not like one of these, you know, Ozzy and Harriet relationships.  Right, right.  She's going to turn around and say, F off to the husband if he starts getting a little 
[01:29:30]  too much on her.  So, yeah.  There you go.  It's really cool.  Well, Spike, give us the big plug.  We've got to take a break here.  We've got Chet Lee.  The big plug.  Yeah, we've got Chet Lee coming in in about five minutes.  The big plug.  I don't even know if he speaks English.  Does he?  I heard in his last movie.  Four hours a day, yeah.  In his last movie, he spoke some.  You guys are going to have to work.  We might have to work.  You're going to have to work.  We have Mary Lynn Rice Cub from the hit show 24 this Saturday night, midnight after  MADtv, come watch me flop sweat. 
[01:30:00]  No, flop sweat.  Come watch me flop sweat and panic.  Fox every Saturday at midnight on Fox.  It's great, man.  I actually have heard really good things about it.  Thank you.  I appreciate it.  And you have a great time slot for edgy content and stuff like that.  Yeah.  That's probably why you got away with what you did.  How far in advance do you tape?  We're taping, you know, about a week in advance, I think, at this point.  A couple weeks.  As the season goes on, it gets, you know, kind of crazy.  We might be taping in November and airing in May.  But we'll just be guessing about what's going to happen in the future. 
[01:30:30]  Let's just say he shot another guy.  That would be good.  Predict the future.  Try to predict what's going to happen and just do a show based on it.  There you go.  All right.  We're going to definitely check out the show.  Spike Ferriston, Saturdays at midnight on Fox.  Hey, thanks, guys.  The new talk show.  Thank you.  Talk show with Spike Ferriston.  Right?  Yeah, that's it.  We forgot to rename it over the summer.  There you go.  All right.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  Opie and Anthony show.  Most of us get here on time.  We're just fat, guys, on the air.  We are so pathetic.  We're fancy, fancy people. 
[01:31:00]  It's the battle of the mental illness.  We are going to dumb this thing down to the point that we're going to be number one with  Down syndrome children.  It's showtime, folks.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  You'll love us.  Hear what everyone else is talking about.  ONA uncut and live continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio starting at 9 a.m. Eastern.  Visit XMRadio.com to subscribe.  The Opie and Anthony show.  Bob Soda, come here for a second. 
[01:31:30]  This is the Opie and Anthony show.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  What's going on with the tickets for the ONA traveling virus in Cleveland?  Remember the $10 ticket offer?  Boy, do I.  I do, too, Ken.  Well, by so many people called in to try to get the $10 ticket, they, like, crashed the  computer over the weekend.  So they extended the offer now.  So for a very limited time, get your $10 tickets.  How limited, Kenny?  No, you got a call.  How limited? 
[01:32:00]  They crashed the computer.  They crashed the computer.  Whoa.  That must have been a lot of tickets.  Wow.  Are you trying to say we're selling a lot of tickets for the ONA traveling virus in Cleveland?  Yeah.  Well, you know, a lot of people are traveling for the traveling virus.  They're, like, caravaring and carpooling.  Caravaring?  Are they stupid?  Yeah.  Maybe they're caravaring from Pittsburgh, which is three hours away?  I think they're sending winners to Pittsburgh.  Cool.  Yeah, but you can still, the bottom line is at the end of the day, you can still get $10 
[01:32:30]  tickets.  And how long is this offer going to last?  Just dial now, people.  I bet you as long as tickets are available.  Yeah, but there's only, it's a smaller venue.  Look, Kenny, I know it's your job to make us look like we're great, but no one's buying  that a computer crashed.  No, it's.  The reality is we need to sell tickets for our Cleveland show.  Why don't you just say it?  Why don't you just say it?  No, it's a smaller venue than PNC or Camden. 
[01:33:00]  It's only 4,000 seats, so if people don't get their tickets now, they're going to be  out of luck.  The guy never changed the floppy disk, and it didn't record all of the ticket requests.  It was some kind of mix-up.  It crashed the computer.  Yeah.  All right.  I'm serious.  All right, we'll buy into it.  Why not?  Listen, everybody knows how terrific you guys are.  It's going to be a great show.  I say we chip in and get Kenny some hair gel, because that dry dew is really, it's dangerous. 
[01:33:30]  You're going to walk by a socket and just catch on fire.  I don't believe in gel or moose.  It's a little something.  I'm worried about you.  Is there any conditioner?  He's going to be walking down the street with his hair on fire, and all of a sudden a helicopter  is going to have to drop a bucket of water.  You know, it's time management.  It's shampoo and conditioner all in one.  All in one.  Yeah.  It's dove soap.  It's actually not even dove.  It's lava soap. 
[01:34:00]  That's what he washes his hair with.  Lava.  Lava oil removing soap.  I got good hygiene.  All right.  All right, but get tickets.  All right.  And, of course, the O&A Traveling Virus is sponsored by, or presented, I should say.  I guess there's a difference there, too.  I don't know.  Presented by Bud Light.  Always worth it.  How happy are you that spinach is killing people?  Is there anything better than a healthy food like that, putting people in the toilet?  I love it.  That is great.  I like spinach.  I don't, I can't get into it. 
[01:34:30]  I don't like broccoli.  I mean, I hate broccoli, too.  I only like asparagus.  Ew.  I love asparagus.  You know, I never, never liked it.  And I just started acquiring a taste for it if it's grilled.  And then, so I, first time in my life really eating a lot of asparagus was maybe a month  ago.  Really.  Restaurant, nice restaurant, filled grilled.  Yeah, when I came with something.  So I ate it.  A few hours later, I went into the bathroom, and I was like, holy Jesus of God, what is this? 
[01:35:00]  I love that.  What is that?  You finally discovered that?  First time ever, dude.  First time ever.  Yeah, I discovered it.  It does something to your.  To your urine.  It does something to your urine.  Yeah.  Asparagus has some type of chemical reaction where it makes it a very odd.  Very pungent.  I don't know if that works.  Strange.  It's very strange.  I thought, I thought maybe there was a sickness in me, because I'm a hypochondriac, so I thought 
[01:35:30]  it was a sickness for a second.  And then I thought, this is what they talk about with asparagus.  Oh, now I get it.  Is there any other foods that do that?  None that I've eaten in my entire life.  Only asparagus does that.  Only asparagus.  It happens to me when I eat white kidney beans.  White kidney beans make the whole room smell like sulfur.  Sulfur.  By the way, we're waiting for Jet Li to arrive.  He's on his way.  He's in traffic.  He's in traffic.  And who suggested that he should just get out and start running on the tops of the cars? 
[01:36:00]  I did.  I've seen him do it in movies.  Yeah.  He runs, do some spinning kicks, swing from some buildings.  And he would be here in seconds.  I bought a bunch of Jet Li films over the weekend, because he was coming in.  I couldn't get into a tower one night.  And you know, like the adult bookstores have to sell now a certain amount of real movies.  Right.  To be open.  6040 or something.  6040 rule.  So they had a bunch of old, these old.  So you actually went in there for a real movie?  I bought real movies.  Or did you just decide on the way out, might as well get something?  What they wound up doing is they took 60 in the city. 
[01:36:30]  Like Jimmy said, you need 60% legitimate, non-sexual content.  That was Mayor Giuliani.  Yeah.  In order to have 40% smut.  So a lot of these places decided, all right, I'll stock it with 60% of the cheapest films  I could get, which amounted to these very old martial arts movies.  On VHS tape.  On VHS tape.  Not even 80 days.  So they'd load up the store with that, because they knew people weren't coming there for that.  Yeah.  But a lot of them now have moved into, I've got all my Sopranos from one of those places. 
[01:37:00]  Because I think they see, like, wow, these things sell a lot, so why not, you know.  But they have a nice little Jet Li section.  Hey, a couple phone calls coming in.  Club Soda Kenny from New York, he just instant feedbacked us.  More people wanting to buy tickets for Beer League, but the computers crashed.  And then someone from their mobile device, also known as a cell phone, tickets for the  ONA traveling virus selling faster than cell phones.  I'm bigger than a mobile device.  Someone did Howie math for us.  It's really funny. 
[01:37:30]  Maybe we'll do that.  Yeah, I saw that.  Pretty good.  And then from someone's cell phone as well.  Hey, Opie, what time did E-Rock get to work this morning?  Oh, we haven't.  Bring in Sam.  Sam.  Sam is our new hire.  He's the official timekeeper of E-Rock.  That's right.  He, uh...  Wait, you're saying 5-10?  Nothing out of you.  E-Rock, you're saying you arrived at 5-10, even though we've been begging you to show up  at 5.  Well, my subway can get here.  I walk from two blocks over to here. 
[01:38:00]  Sam and Sam.  What time do you get here, Travis?  I take the same subway that he can...  What?  Oh, boy.  Wait a minute.  4-30.  Wait, hold on.  Let me get your mic on.  Why would it work?  4-30, I get in, and I take the same subway that Eric can take.  Do men give up their seats for you?  Yes, they do.  Wait, what time does Than show up?  4-30.  Me and Than are either here between 4-15 and 4-30.  And E-Rock decides that he doesn't have to be here before 5 o'clock for some reason. 
[01:38:30]  Oh, boy.  Uh-oh.  What's the telly?  Hold on, hold on.  Let's...  Oh, boy.  Sam is entering the studio, our new hire, so of course we've got to play this.  Let me see your thumb.  Wow.  Wow.  Sam's not blind.  His ancestors, Thomas Jefferson.  He's not black.  He doesn't have big lips, just a real big thumb. 
[01:39:00]  Well, his skin's kind of weird.  It's not black or white.  If he's white, then he's dark.  If he's black, he's light.  Who the hell can figure?  Who the hell can figure?  If Sam's white or a...  Mm-mm, white or a...  Much funnier, by the way.  Watch that.  You know, because he's white with an afro.  No, Sam's not black.  He's not black.  Don't smoke crack. 
[01:39:30]  He ain't black.  So Sam's our new hire.  Low man on the totem pole.  Making absolutely no money, really.  And, uh, E-Rock?  Been with us for two years?  Yep.  You're claiming you got here at what time?  Today?  5.10.  5.10.  How much you want to bet?  What?  No.  What?  How much you want to bet?  That's not a what.  I don't know.  We got an official timekeeper.  It's his whole job to wait for you to arrive.  He's got you on the stopwatch and everything. 
[01:40:00]  Sam?  And I know.  I went to Sam today, and I said, hi, I'm here.  Here's the time.  At 5.14 and 39.78 seconds.  That doesn't sound like 5.10 to me.  That sounds closer to 5.15.  Just to keep everybody informed, we did a total tally for last week.  Of course you did.  And it was a total time late was one hour, 37 minutes, and 30 seconds.  Wow.  In a week.  I love this bit. 
[01:40:30]  This could be my favorite bit ever.  Hawk?  Hawk, response, comment, comment, Hawk, comment.  Sam was an intern only a few months ago.  Now he's in charge of letting us know when E-Rock comes to work.  How late E-Rock is on a daily and weekly basis.  So that is, wow, in a week, you could do a lot in that time.  What was it, an hour or what?  One hour, 37 minutes, and 30 seconds.  Over an hour and a half.  Yeah.  What do you got to say for yourself, E-Rock? 
[01:41:00]  I have nothing to say for myself.  Comment?  When are you going to start showing up at 5?  5 o'clock when everyone gets here.  I was trying.  I'm so glad I got that scary power where I actually, off mic, said, please get here at  5, and you said you would, and you continue to be late.  That makes me feel good.  The subway gets me here anywhere between 5.05 to 5.10 when I take it at 4.10, 4.15 in the  morning.  So when I get off the one subway, wait for the end train to come in, then when I get 
[01:41:30]  here, I walk down.  But Travis takes the same train.  I don't care.  I don't know how that works.  What time would you have to take it to get here a smidge earlier, if I may?  I don't know.  I'll look.  Wait, so you never even checked out the schedule to get here early?  So I try to figure out how to get here at 5, like we asked.  You realize it was dropping you off late, and you never once said, let me check if I  can take an earlier train and get here just a smidge early. 
[01:42:00]  I think it's somewhere around 3.45.  Atta boy.  I like it.  Is it?  Travis?  Wouldn't Travis know?  Yes, she would.  Please don't say smidge again.  Why?  Travis, uh...  That's such an awful word.  All right, scooch down.  Let Travis talk.  No, don't say scooch.  Scooch.  Scooch and smidge.  Travis, what time do you have to...  Scooch and smidge in the morning.  I take a 3.30 train.  You take the 3.30.  Yeah.  Oh, that's so cute.  Phew.  3.30.  Me and Mexicans, that is early.  Yeah.  Dedicated.  Wow, you notice that too?  Oh, yeah. 
[01:42:30]  Club Soda Kenny and...  Well, Club Soda Kenny doesn't really notice that type of thing, but I had to point out to  him, we're waiting at a light, and the subway, they all empty with nothing but Mexicans.  Really?  Because they've got to get to all the restaurants and stuff.  Oh, early.  Cleaning crews and the kitchen staff, all that have...  Unskilled labor.  They have a very early commute that I had no idea about until we started doing morning  radio.  That's all you see around anywhere from 4 to 5 in the morning.  Train schedule there, right? 
[01:43:00]  I sure do.  And late at night, or early in the morning when we get in, Eric can just go 20 minutes  earlier and take a subway that will get him in 20 minutes earlier.  On both trains.  Yeah.  And trains run 20 minutes, every 20 minutes.  Oh, boy.  Oh, no.  Look how happy these guys are.  Oh, they love it.  They love it.  Young Eric?  Yeah.  Looks like a little bit of new information has been brought to the table.  I'll give him the subway schedule.  So, about... 
[01:43:30]  That's nice of you.  That was nice of you, Travis.  Anything you might want to do just to leave perhaps a tad earlier?  A tad's not bad.  No, a tad's cool.  What did you say earlier?  I mean, I wanted to see if we could just get here a smidge earlier.  Well, he needs a skosh more time.  Oh, no.  Oh!  My spell missed.  Aha.  I had my shield up.  That was a spell to make you dumber, and I missed. 
[01:44:00]  No.  It hit me in the head.  Uh-oh.  Backfired.  It backfired.  All right.  Sam, once again.  So, he arrived at what time this morning?  He arrived at 514 and 39.78 seconds.  Around 514.  Sam, I love you, but your hair at that length is disturbing on...  You look like asparagus.  It really annoys me.  Oh.  Old asparagus head. 
[01:44:30]  Try to get a little longer next time.  Atta boy.  Yeah.  Are you taming it down or letting it grow out?  I can't tell.  No.  I like to cut it short.  That way it can wait a longer time before I have to get another haircut.  Oh, okay.  Hey, while we're talking about staff problems...  Yeah.  It's not necessarily a problem, but it's an observation that I want to bring to the table.  Okay.  Fair enough.  Most people know that Kenny picks me up in the morning.  Of course.  Kenny, you make my life easy.  I want to start by saying you make my life so easy. 
[01:45:00]  You know that.  But I've started leaving my apartment a little earlier.  Uh-oh.  When Kenny used to pick me up, he would ring the bell at 455.  We went over this on our show.  Yeah.  And then I begged him, will you stop with the OCD 455?  5, right?  So then it turned out to be 5.  But every day at 5, my buzzer rings, right?  Yeah.  So I started leaving early.  I don't know.  Off and on in the last couple weeks, I will leave before he has the chance to hit the buzzer. 
[01:45:30]  And I leave my apartment, and guess what I get to see?  Kenny, Kenny, in the lobby of my building, staring at my buzzer, waiting for the proper time to ring it.  What?  If you're there.  It is one of the creepiest things I've ever seen in my life.  If you're there.  Jimmy, have you experienced this OCD thing with Kenny in time?  Yeah, it's just awful.  Like, he's there early.  I'm talking maybe a minute, two minutes early.  Who cares?  Ring the bell, right?  Right.  Or the buzzer, whatever. 
[01:46:00]  He refuses until the proper time.  And I actually caught him just staring at my buzzer, waiting.  Waiting.  Waiting for the time to hit 455 or 5, whatever.  Almost there.  Almost there.  Stay on target.  Almost there.  It's early, and he's just staring at the buzzer.  Oh, what a creep.  I just want to be punctual.  If you're there, why not just hit the buzzer? 
[01:46:30]  Yeah, it's not like you're there a half hour early.  You're there within a minute or two is what I'm getting at.  It's like a minute.  Right.  He told me 5 o'clock.  Ew.  That's not punctual.  Oh, that's psychotic.  5 o'clock means 5 o'clock.  He didn't see that I could see him.  And I'm like, oh, my God.  I wish I had a video camera.  He's just staring at the buzzer.  There it is.  G.H.'s buzzer.  Got to wait till 5.  Got to wait.  It's 4.59 right now.  5, 4, 3, 2, button press sequence, 1, ignition. 
[01:47:00]  We have buzzer.  What a lunatic.  5 o'clock means 5 o'clock.  5 o'clock.  Yeah.  It certainly does.  All right.  Smidge and scooch in the morning.  Smidge and scooch.  Here's the update on spinach.  Thank you, Kenny.  You make my life terrific, though.  I appreciate it.  Switching out to the news this morning on that deadly E. coli outbreak. 
[01:47:30]  19 states now affected by sickness linked to tainted spinach.  More than 100 people sick, half of them hospitalized, 17% with kidney failure and one confirmed death.  And now authorities are investigating whether the death of a 23-month-old girl in Ohio is also linked to the outbreak,  an outbreak whose cause is still apparently a mystery.  ABC's David Muir is at a farm this morning on eastern Long Island.  He's been looking into the clues and the questions. 
[01:48:00]  David?  Troubling, Diane.  And, you know, the focus now has turned to the spinach farms themselves, primarily in California.  All this comes as a second recall is announced this morning.  River Ranch Fresh Foods plans to recall its spinach.  And here's what investigators are going to be doing this morning in California, going farm to farm.  They're looking at the irrigation systems for the spinach and the harvesting of the spinach.  It can happen on the farm.  It can happen in the distribution, the processing.  It can happen at the restaurant, making it all extremely difficult to zero in on the cause. 
[01:48:30]  I think if it's multi-state and is it multi-state?  Well, yeah.  I don't think all these people ate at the same restaurant.  I think you could rule out the restaurant.  I think it's one of two things.  Terrorism.  There's terrorists taking dumps on our fields.  Or Mexican laborers protesting this whole immigration thing by, hey, look at what we do now. 
[01:49:00]  We're the ones that pick this, so we're going to start tainting your vegetables with E. coli.  Or it could have just been one big plant that a lot of it comes from that had a problem.  Or maybe just one lousy, you know, kitchen worker that had the ass flu.  Yeah.  A little itch, itch, itch, and then he's preparing your food.  But so much of it, like one guy preparing so much.  Maybe he has to work two or three jobs.  Yeah.  Enough info ain't in yet, but I'm not eating spinach, I'll tell you that. 
[01:49:30]  I like the second one that he came up with.  Yeah.  A little protest.  Yeah.  I like riling people up.  I like getting people mad at other ethnic background people.  I like stirring that pot, that melting pot.  Who are we going to turn to when the illegal immigrants become real people to do all our  dirty work?  Well, they could still do it.  Nah, we're going to want cheap labor, though. 
[01:50:00]  Oh, because they're going to want more money?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So then we're going to be like, all right, fine.  But we still need someone to pick our fruit and vegetables very cheap.  The Poles?  The Poles?  The Polish people.  Who are we going to turn to, you think?  Poor Romanians?  Um, Taiwanese?  Young Tibetan children?  I'm trying to think.  Vietnam?  No. 
[01:50:30]  The handy capable.  You know, you laugh.  I bring up, I'll bring up one more item from the Renaissance Festival yesterday.  I saw a gentleman, wasn't actually a child, he was a gentleman with a Down syndrome.  And he was working security at the Renaissance Festival, had a uniform on walkie-talkie. 
[01:51:00]  Hello?  Imagine getting the call from him.  Hello?  I want peanuts.  No, it's just supposed to be used for emergencies.  Cotton candy.  All right, here's the update on the spinach.  You know they just would have put him on the rack.  Oh, oh.  Sorry.  That's okay.  I'm just trying to get a little more authentic in the Renaissance period.  Yeah.  He just would have been disemboweled.  This is what they're suggesting you do with your spinach. 
[01:51:30]  All right.  Simply put, they're telling everyone this morning to check out your refrigerator.  Take all kinds of spinach, organic, non-organic, right out.  Throw it out until they get to the bottom of this E. coli outbreak.  And, Diane, to give you an idea of how widespread this is, 19 saints, as I mentioned, from California to New York.  And at a restaurant in New York this weekend, the waitress said to me, before you make your order, we just want to let you know, we took all the spinach out of the menu.  Well, I'm leaving.  I'm sure.  And, by the way, a question people have been asking, how long after you eat it, do the symptoms begin to occur? 
[01:52:00]  We're told they are two to four days afterwards.  Thanks a lot, David.  Oh, so you don't even know.  Yeah, I was at a restaurant last night, too.  They said instead of spinach, we're serving broccoli.  Oh, well.  Who cares?  So don't eat the spinach for a while.  Yeah.  All right.  Jet Li is here.  So we'll take a break.  We'll talk to Jet Li next.  Yeah.  Yes, we will.  Okay.  It's the O&A virus spreading across America. 
[01:52:30]  Robe.  Soup.  Tears.  Poodle.  Robert Reed.  And repeat.  And repeat.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  We should get right into it.  In studio, Jet Li.  Hi.  Jet Li.  Look at that.  Morning, everybody. 
[01:53:00]  Look at that.  A real movie star.  Yeah.  By the way.  Real movie star.  People pay to see this guy in the movies.  Love it.  I was, for some reason, under the impression that Fearless was already out because I'm an  idiot.  So, I drove by the theater last night.  I was trying to get in and they're like, no, not yet.  What a dope I am.  I want to be all prepared and talk about the movie today and it's not out yet.  It opens Friday, I think, right?  Fearless in theaters Friday.  Wide.  Open Friday wide.  So, we were talking in the break. 
[01:53:30]  You started doing films in China.  Yes.  And how hard is it to make the transition into doing films here in English?  I made, I think, a 25 movie in Asia.  Then, you know, finally in Lethal Weapon 4.  Yeah, Lethal Weapon 4.  Yeah.  That was a biggie.  Yeah.  The first time I played a villain in the States in the movie.  How was that?  Was it a big difference from Chinese productions to coming over here?  I mean, just as far as the working of it. 
[01:54:00]  Yeah, the system is totally different.  Yeah.  Especially, you know, Lethal Weapon 4 is the big movie.  Yeah.  A lot of big stars there.  Is there more people on the set here than there are?  A lot of people in the camera, you know?  Yeah.  They have seven cameras, cover many angles.  I would think they have stuntmen here and in China, they just kill the people.  That's what us Americans think.  It's like, ah, they just line them up and then really, you know, kick their ass. 
[01:54:30]  I'm very lucky, you know, everybody treated me very nice in the first movie.  And then after the first movie, then I played Romeo Must Die in the American movies.  Yeah.  Yeah.  People are nice to you because we know that if we're not, you'll kill us.  He's laughing.  Oh, yeah, I would.  Now, you've done professional fighting outside of movies?  No.  Did you do any, ah...  Yeah, I do martial arts sports when I was young. 
[01:55:00]  When you were younger?  Yeah, yeah.  Before 17, I got a five-year champion in China.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then you decided you wanted to go into movies or somebody say, hey, I think you...  Somebody said, you know, I think in 1974, and I did a Kung Fu demonstration in Hong Kong.  When Pudilser came to me and said, you know, before, I think just one year before, Bruce Lee just passed away.  And then they say, we want to find a new blood. 
[01:55:30]  Yeah.  When you grow up, you want to be the actor?  I say, oh, yeah, of course.  You want to be new Bruce Lee?  Yeah.  I don't know.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Then they say, okay, every year they check out of me, you know, until five years later, they say, okay, this is the movie.  This first movie called Shot in Temple.  Was he your hero, Bruce Lee, growing up?  Me?  Was Bruce Lee the guy you, like, looked up to?  In my mind, I don't have a hero.  Yeah, Bruce Lee is a hack.  No, no, no.  He's a very good...  Jesus, oh, yeah.  He's a very good martial artist and a philosopher, but I don't see he's a hero. 
[01:56:00]  Jet Lee doesn't fight less than 30 people in a scene.  It is really impressive.  Even though you know it's not full contact, just to be able to coordinate that, I mean, it's some of the best fighters.  I bought a bunch of your stuff because I knew you were coming in, and I just seen bits and pieces, and it really is impressive.  There is not one scene where you just fight like one guy.  All you do is fight groups.  Yeah, the character, you know, I play a lot of strong character.  Maybe we call him master, martial art master, or hero, or whatever, tough guy, so I beat up a bunch of people. 
[01:56:30]  But in the normal day, Jet Lee, just actor, or Jet Lee, just learning martial arts, never want to fight with people.  You really?  I see.  You know, everybody here can beat me up.  I only smile.  Yeah, right.  He'll smile as he's kicking our heads off.  I like how they're giving you more roles where you're acting, though.  It's not just, you know, playing kick an ass, because I loved the last movie.  What's the name of that one with the collar? 
[01:57:00]  Yeah, Unleashed.  Yeah, Unleashed.  It's a fantastic movie.  Really good.  Really enjoyed that one.  Thank you.  And talk about kicking some ass in that one.  No, the movie is, the whole idea is, I want to say, you know, if the people only know martial art, like the character I played, you can beat up 20 people.  Yeah.  A few seconds.  But he's not a human.  He just doesn't know, you know, how to share love, family, friendship.  Yeah, trained like a dog.  Just like a dog in the beginning.  So, end of the movie, you know, through Morgan Freeman's character, music, bring him back, become a human being. 
[01:57:30]  I think the big difference really depends, you know, not just physical.  Who controls the physical is very important.  You know, just like, I think martial art, where the gun doesn't mean good or evil.  Who use it?  Yeah.  In a nice way, it's good.  Everybody like it.  If you use it, by the way, hurt yourself, hurt your family, hurt everybody.  Yeah.  Have you been, I know Jackie Chan, everybody talks about, because he does his own stunts a lot.  Do you do your own stunts, or do you have somebody that will kind of? 
[01:58:00]  I learned martial arts when I was little, eight years old, you know, as I said.  And I do everything I learned in the past.  I don't do something I never learned, like a gym about the building.  I never learned that.  That makes sense, yeah.  Yeah, right.  Yeah.  What do you think of the use of CGI and cables and things like that to make some of these,  you know, spins and things that obviously people can't really do?  What do you think of the use of those in a lot of the movies? 
[01:58:30]  I think it really depends on what kind of movie, right?  If you talk about the Matrix or, you know, some funny movie, comedy, or, you know, cartoon.  Right.  They use cable or, you know, technology to help.  A lot of actresses or actors, they're not a real martial artist.  They only learn four months, six months, then doing the movie.  Again, they can only do what they know.  No, very hard for them.  So, you need to take a lot of the camera angle to cover that, to show their very good story in a fighter on the screen. 
[01:59:00]  I'm very open, you know, everybody can do action movie.  I'm very glad to see it, really.  Different kind of martial art films.  How much of any given fight scene is actually done at one time?  Is it really cut up as they're filming?  I think in Hong Kong, traditional martial art films, you know, we spend a lot of time in each sequences.  Like Fearless, we have 90 days shooting, but 60 days fight. 
[01:59:30]  Yeah.  You know, we do the rehearsal many times and cover, we try to keep it as long as possible for each shot.  Right.  By the way, the shots are nice and long.  Nice and long, you know.  Right.  From the head to the toe, you know, full shots.  But in these days, usually the studio gives you three days, five days for the ending cover.  So, you don't have time.  What do you do?  You just shot at many angles.  Anthony, by the way, that's Ronnie Yu, the director of Fearless. 
[02:00:00]  Oh, yeah.  Hi, I'm the quiet one.  Yeah, the quiet one is the actual director of the film.  Hi, everybody.  This is Ronnie Yu here.  Yeah, I just wanted to introduce you to the show there.  I'm sorry, Ronnie Yu.  Thank you.  It must be hard to direct.  Hey, kick some ass.  There you go.  Roll them.  Roll them.  Well, it was easy.  You know, just call action and then let them do this stuff.  That's it.  Right, sure.  And then call cut when you don't see right or you don't like it and do it again.  Cut, please.  Fist of Legend, I think that's called, right? 
[02:00:30]  Yep.  I was watching and there's a scene where you do a one-arm, two-finger push-up.  Do you really, can you really do two-fingered push-ups?  Well, I was young, right?  You were young?  No.  Oh, it really was impressive.  I like when he says when he's young, he still looks like a young guy.  I mean, geez.  Oh, I am learning martial arts already, what, 30, 30, 35 years.  Wow, when you're a kid.  Yeah, when you're a kid, you start.  Yep.  Is that all you directed martial arts films or have you done like other stuff?  God, I've done what? 
[02:01:00]  What have I done?  I've done Freddy vs. Jason.  I've done Brian Chucky.  And I've been around, yeah.  I've been around.  A couple of movies.  I've been around.  Is it going all right?  I know.  So I've been doing some cutting up people, yeah.  So you get back to China or do you have relatives over there where you still go back or do you  pretty much here in the States all the time now?  In the past few years, I've stayed in Los Angeles, but now I moved back to China because  Oh, you did?  Yeah.  My daughter grew up. 
[02:01:30]  They need to go to school learning Chinese.  Right.  In American school.  In Shanghai, in China.  So how were you received in China after being here for so long and becoming so successful?  I like, you know, both countries and they have a great culture, you know, here I have  a movie in the States.  I still have, you know, a lot of people work with me in the States.  You're very, very…  Agent manager, you know.  Yeah.  You need all those people.  They need some of your money.  They will call me.  Always call me.  Yeah, make a movie. 
[02:02:00]  Are you extremely popular over there?  Like, wherever you go, people know who you are?  Yes.  In China.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, I made a lot of movies in China, so the population is big.  Yeah.  You're walking on the street.  It's difficult.  That's all we've heard about with China.  Yeah.  Boy, you guys.  Showing us how to make more Chinese.  Either fighting and something else that starts with an F.  You got offered Crouching Tiger, and you, I think when they said your wife was pregnant, 
[02:02:30]  you didn't want to work while she was pregnant.  Yes.  Now you see how big of a film that was.  Do you kind of wish that you would have done it?  No, no, no.  I think a man's promise.  I'm a quite, I'm a very traditional Chinese people.  So, I promised to my wife 10 years ago, I'd say, you know, if we date, we love each other  until 10 days later, we still love each other.  Then we go to marry.  If we marry, you have baby, I will stop working with you. 
[02:03:00]  I think I did the right decision until today.  You know, I feel, you know, you cannot make 30 movies, 30 babies.  Yeah.  You can make a 30, 40 movie, right?  No, it's okay.  I'm very happy there, you know, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is very successful.  How many kids do you have?  Four.  Oh, okay.  And you get to spend a lot of time.  Are they getting into martial arts?  No.  No?  No?  Really?  They like, you know, I think.  I think you kicked ass, but. 
[02:03:30]  Well, they're like, because actor, you know, actress, whatever, you know, I will tell them  the truth is if you want to be the action actor, you know, learn martial arts,  eight hours a day for the first three years, five years, then they try, you know, 30 minutes.  I say, yeah, I'm too tired.  I don't know what it is.  Something easy.  Life is not easy.  That's got to be something you love, too.  Yeah, love.  You must have loved to do it.  They don't need to fight because you fight, so they have Jet Li money.  They don't need to fight for it.  And could there ever be a, you know, my dad could kick your dad's ass in the school? 
[02:04:00]  No.  When someone goes, you know, hey, I'll get my father down here.  Okay, I've got to get Jet Li down here now to kick your ass.  Let's go to the phones.  We've got a lot of questions for Jet Li.  Anthony in Virginia, what's up?  Not too much.  I just wanted to tell Jet Li it's a huge honor this would be amongst the same celestial satellite  sky as him right now.  But I just want to say I saw his movie, Spiritless.  It is a fantastic movie.  I saw it from a funny mind.  It just came back to China. 
[02:04:30]  It brought the DVD back.  But don't worry.  I'm still going to go to the movies and see it again.  Just for the effect of it.  Okay.  So he saw the Chinese version of the movie.  Oh, okay.  Is this a remake or is this the film?  No, no.  It was released early in the year.  Okay.  So, yeah.  And it was the wait.  Okay, good.  A lot of people have been, there's been a whole, like, not even a resurgence, but like this  becoming very popular in the United States, a lot of the martial arts films, a lot more 
[02:05:00]  people.  Because it used to be something that was a little campy.  It wasn't accepted by a lot of people.  Now, though, people just seem they can't get enough.  It's amazing.  You guys are the action stars.  I mean, you used to just be, like, Stallone and, you know, other, like, stupid guys that  just run around with pistols.  But now you have to be able to fight to be an action star.  Yeah.  It's kind of nice.  There's a couple of movies I want to see.  And Unleashed is definitely one of them.  Yeah.  Let's go to John in Chicago.  John?  First of all, I'm sweating profusely from my armpits just getting ready to talk to Jet Li. 
[02:05:30]  I love your movies, man.  Thank you.  I wanted to ask, what exactly do they mean by this is your last martial arts epic film?  And when you are gone, I will always miss you and forever love your movies.  Thank you.  Thank you.  And martial arts, in Chinese, we say wushu.  So, spelled in from two words.  When it's a stop, when it's a war. 
[02:06:00]  Stop war.  So, but we see a lot of action movies, they only focus on war.  You know, people beat up each other, use violence against violence.  And not so many people talk about the stop.  So, in this film, I put my all belief, and not just physical part, also mentally, you know, philosophy, everything.  What is martial art?  Why we need to use martial art, learning martial art in life?  Who's the enemy?  So, I say everything I believe in this film. 
[02:06:30]  And that's why I say this is my last wushu movie.  Because everything I want to say is already said in this film.  But in the future, I will continue to do movie.  Some movie, I just think, you know, cop fight with the mafia on the street, just like a car chase or gunshots, beat up each other.  I never know which punch belong to this made in China, this made in Japan, this arm.  Nobody can tell me.  I think it's just a normal human being, have two arms, two legs, beat up each other on the street. 
[02:07:00]  That's not a martial art.  It's just a fighting.  Yeah.  You know, for the character, for the script.  And I think that's the point.  I say this is my personal movie and everything I want to say in the movie.  You speak good English, too.  They say you take four hours a day that you're tutored.  You speak good English.  No, no.  But that's right.  To make the translation from Chinese.  I mean the way you just said that.  I'm saying to make the translation, to jump, to do films in one country, and then to come here. 
[02:07:30]  And it says here in the Bible that you take four hours a day is tutored.  So it's obviously to keep doing more films.  You speak English well.  Oh, yeah.  I said that really wrong.  Yeah, you really.  I did come up and sound stupid.  You speak good English.  English?  You speak good.  Are you taking really four hours a day of tutoring?  No, just in the beginning.  Because if you're working here, you need to go to the side.  You need to listen for the director, how to social with the people on the side. 
[02:08:00]  So in the first one year, two years, after that, I say, hmm, whatever, how hard I try.  But still a lot of people English better than me on the street.  They're saying something.  Oh, but please.  So that I changed my, and I studied Buddhism.  I spent a lot of time studying Buddhism in past 10 years.  Really?  Yeah.  You know how many Americans can speak Chinese, though?  Pfft.  Not that many, my friend.  You know what we can say? 
[02:08:30]  Mushu pork.  That's pretty much it.  Look at it.  We can order off of menus.  We stink.  We can't even pick up a second language.  I'm always amazed when guys come over here and learn the language and do films.  It really is.  I love that.  You know what I also love and definitely respect and appreciate the discipline of the martial arts, not what you were just saying.  Because I know me personally.  Secondly, if I spent time to learn and become proficient in the martial arts, I would go out to bars to just beat people up just because I could. 
[02:09:00]  It's this whole discipline thing and this mental thing that you get into where it's like, no, it's not about that.  It's like, but can I just go out and have a few beers and crack someone over the head?  You can, and then you get cracked back, and people are going to beat you up.  But that's one of the major reasons why me and Jet want to make fearless. 
[02:09:30]  We just want to give an alternate perspective on what is the true sort of philosophy behind Chinese wuxia.  It's not really about kicking ass.  You know, I mean, of course, there will be a lot of people better than you are.  You know, but like Jet was saying, you know, like Chinese character was made up by, like, all different words, you know, to form one character.  And in Chinese, wuxia means wu.  The character wu actually means, you know, a word conflict.  And shu means the art, you know, the technique. 
[02:10:00]  So actually, you know, the better wuxia master you are, the better peacemaker you are, you know.  You ever get beat up by anybody in real life, even as a kid in school, anybody ever beat you up?  No.  No.  In a little boy, I beat somebody, I fight with somebody.  You fight when you were a little kid.  Yes.  No, like every kid.  I bet he still tells that story and says he beat you up.  But when I learn martial art deeper, deeper, you know, and then I know you cannot use martial art to hurt people. 
[02:10:30]  Yeah.  Since then, I never used martial art.  We are getting cut off by the music that they shut us off the plug.  Obviously, it's Fearless, September the 22nd.  Is that this Friday?  Yeah.  What night of the week?  This Friday, the great Jet Li, Fearless, a new film.  I'm certainly going to go see this.  Yeah.  Because everything you do is just great, man.  It's been fantastic.  What a pleasure.  Great movie star.  All right.  He's the best.  This was awesome.  Jet Li.  Really happy you came.  And, of course, Ronnie Yu.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[02:11:00]  Thank you.  Go see Fearless.  And if you're not joining us over at XM, have a great day.  See you.  See you.  Steve SOS.  I need milk immediately.  Coming soon to the Opie and Anthony show.  Milk Diva.  Diva.  World Tour.  World Tour.  Featuring all your favorite Milk Diva hits.  Live.  Live.  In concert.  My blood sugar level is dropping as I speak.  Featuring the classic, there's a deli downstairs. 
[02:11:30]  There's a deli right downstairs, is there not?  Oh, that app gets milk from Dwayne Reed.  You could forget the number one smash hit.  I'll suck milk out of a cow.  I'll suck milk out of a cow.  I don't care.  I just need milk.  A special guest.  The Milk Diva.  I walk into the studio and he goes, where's my milk?  Why are you going to Dwayne Reed for the milk?  And for the first time in over a decade, you don't bring me milk anymore.  And then I'm noticing there is no milk around. 
[02:12:00]  So I'm like, eh, I will pass out.  You sound like a madman.  I know I'm whining.  The Milk Diva, coming soon to the O.B. and Anthony Show.  O.B. wants milk.  He only takes it from CVS for Rite Aid.  Who would go to Dwayne Reed for milk knowing that, how desperate I am right now?  You get condoms and maybe some shampoo from Dwayne Reed.  You don't get milk from Dwayne Reed.  The O.B. and Anthony XM walkover begins now. 
[02:12:30]  Wow, still here.  Dude, you're a citizen now.  I don't think he's allowed to go back.  You're on.  I thought I heard you.  Lake, you're on.  Hello.  No, you're not on.  Now I'm on.  Are we on the radio?  Now we're broadcasting.  All right, now we're broadcasting.  Our friend from Australia is still in town there, Jimmy.  That's what we started saying.  What did you do over the weekend?  He leaves Wednesday. 
[02:13:00]  We'll finally get rid of him.  Yeah, what did you do over the weekend there?  I just dawdle around.  I don't do anything in particular.  I just walked.  I went to the Riverside Park yesterday.  I went and had a look at the water there.  A walkabout, yeah.  He's realizing that he's run out of things to see in New York, right?  I haven't run out of things to see.  I still haven't been to the bridge.  I still haven't been really far downtown except when I went to it.  It's a bridge, pal.  It's really nothing.  How about the museum?  The Brooklyn Bridge is very cool, actually.  You could walk and bike across it above the cars, 
[02:13:30]  and it's like a wooden path,  and then there's benches and stuff in the middle of the bridge  where you could hang out and check out the skyline of Lower Manhattan.  It's a fucking bridge.  Yeah, there's a few museums and things.  I'm not too interested in that.  Museums of Natural History, you got that in Australia.  Yeah, I'm going to learn a lot of stuff.  I don't know.  And then the Intrepid Airspace Museum, you don't really care about that.  Where's that?  It's right down there by the water.  Okay.  Clothes for remodeling.  Those sons of bitches. 
[02:14:00]  Well, fuck that.  So, yeah, I've just been walking around.  Walkabout.  Take a walkabout.  Try to avoid the stingrays.  It's what the aboriginals do.  They go walkabout.  Yeah, walkabout.  I want to play that stupid boo thing.  Didgeridoo.  Didgeridoo.  The girls can only play the sticks, though, or they get beaten.  If they play the didgeridoo, they get beaten.  I like that.  What I like playing is the rain stick.  You just have to turn it over. 
[02:14:30]  And it goes, no.  No, then it just sounds like, he knows it sounds like rain.  He knows.  I think I know what you're talking about, but yeah.  You've never played the rain stick, Jimmy?  I've never heard of the rain stick.  It's just a big monster rain stick.  I've got a rain stick in my pants.  Watch.  It'll pour in a second.  It's a big piece of, I don't know, bamboo.  And you turn it over and it sounds like it's raining.  It's a very instrument to learn.  Very easy instrument to learn.  Do you hate when anyone references kangaroos? 
[02:15:00]  Yes.  Because it's like.  I'm from a, my city's got like three and a half million.  Yeah.  And as I said.  Kangaroos?  No, people.  And.  I thought kangaroos did.  And like I was working at the summer camp in Oregon.  And all the kids just thought like.  They said some of the most ignorant things I've ever heard.  Like, why aren't the presidents on your money?  Are there kangaroos in your backyard?  And I'm like, there's more people in my city than your state.  And you.  I don't know.  What city are you from?  Melbourne.  Melbourne.  What's that? 
[02:15:30]  Melbourne or Sydney.  What's the bigger?  Don't say it.  Melbourne.  They hate when you say Melbourne.  It's Melbourne.  Melbourne.  It's Melbourne.  It's Melbourne.  And he's rushing.  Well, do you see the kangaroos though?  Jump around.  Yeah.  If you go into the country.  Yeah.  If you go about two hours down or whatever.  It's like standing around here and someone asking you.  Hey, have you seen a wolf walking around?  You know, you're not going to see it.  You got to go into the country and then you see the wildlife.  You ever see a bear?  That dummy walks over.  Hello.  The bear is talking on his Blackberry right now. 
[02:16:00]  Can I point out an observation, by the way, about Jet Li?  It was a terrific interview.  Love his films.  Fearless is going to be an amazing movie, right?  We do so many Chinese jokes.  None of us had the balls to even attempt something.  What?  Well, I wasn't going to say the director looked like the guy that was in Tora, Tora, Tora that came with the peace plan after they had already bombed.  He looked like one of the ambassadors from Tora, Tora, Tora.  I didn't see that.  He had completely round glasses on. 
[02:16:30]  That was so stereotypical.  Well, when you said.  A Chinese gentleman.  When you said, do you get recognized in China?  I'm like, why don't I have the balls to say?  Of course he doesn't.  They all look the same.  Oh, see, that would have been all.  Because he, from that couch, would have been able to kick his shoe into your nose.  We like to point out to everyone that we are indeed pussies at times.  Anyone is a pussy to Jet Li.  Have you seen his films?  Have you watched his films?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Of course.  They're really good, yeah.  And the guy, you know, is a planetary celebrity. 
[02:17:00]  And he was nice.  He's a celebrity of the planet.  He was great.  He had a good time.  Let's get strolling.  I felt like he really liked it.  Have a look a bit.  Huh?  I felt like he really liked it.  Jimmy, you can take your arm off my shoulder.  Or else I might become amorous.  I got a jacket on like a homeless person.  Friends of Jet Li coming through.  That's right.  You'd appreciate that if you didn't have your arm.  You would have loved the interview, sir.  I applaud on.  I thought that was Jet Li. 
[02:17:30]  He's a little fella, too.  Yeah, he's not a big guy, but you could put it in proportion.  Your tie's too short, sir.  I think your tie's too short.  That wouldn't happen.  Can you pronounce his own name?  Hold on.  Jet.  You think he could pronounce his own name?  Jet Li.  Oh.  I don't know.  Of course he can.  Wow, we're brave now, aren't we?  Yeah, look at us.  Why didn't you ask that?  We sure are showing him.  Wow, we showed him.  I hope he doesn't have satellite radio.  Kenny, do you think Jet Li could throw you a beating?  I would spar with him.  You'd spar with him?  No, I don't.  I'm in a friendly match. 
[02:18:00]  I'm saying if he had to throw you a beating, do you think he could?  Yeah, but I'd hang in there.  I don't think so.  I love you, Kenny.  You know that.  I love you very much.  But he's such a small, wiry guy.  I think he'd be all over you.  You wouldn't even know what to do.  Well, that's the whole thing.  He probably has the speed on me.  Yeah.  And he doesn't.  I don't think he'd be intimidated by you.  He'd use that martial arts mind he's got.  He seems like he's got the body and the mind.  Yeah.  And you have the body, and there's nothing up there but dry hair. 
[02:18:30]  I never kick human with brain-like stegosaurus.  He'd kick him in the hair, and like a porcupine, he'd have quills in his feet.  You're saying your hair's dry, Kenny.  How dry is it?  I want to ask Master Paul when we get over there.  He would be impressed with Jet Li.  Of course, I'd be impressed, gentlemen.  Man's a master.  Wake up with Whoopi.  Oh. 
[02:19:00]  I was going to cross the street, but it's flashing.  Should we go that way?  Or that way?  Oh, I don't know.  Let's just better safe than sorry.  That's something I'm sure Kenny would say.  Come on, fella.  All right.  Then we'll go this way.  Okay.  We're avoiding the porno newsstand again.  Yeah.  No issue a honcho for today.  Look at the little dog.  Look.  Aw.  Is that a Yorkshire Terrier?  Hello.  That's just like little Tiffy Tootles.  Look at the dog.  What's its name?  Google. 
[02:19:30]  Google.  He's named that research engine.  Are you nasty?  Is that a nasty bitey dog?  No, no.  Does it nip?  He doesn't bark.  Does it nip?  It's shaking, though, like Michael J. Fox.  Well, look who's touching him.  Jimmy.  Little Jimmy.  Look, we're in the middle of the road.  He's very cute.  What's his name?  Google.  Oh, you just said that.  Oh, it's very sweet.  Hello, little dog.  Let's see.  Hi.  Hi.  Little dog's very cute.  This cabbie's annoyed.  Fuck him.  Ah.  Yes, my friend. 
[02:20:00]  Come on, mortgage payments.  Let's go.  Come on.  You can't be in the middle of the road.  You're the car payment.  You're the mortgage payment.  Let's go.  Let's go.  Wait.  Why am I the car payment?  All right.  You're the car payment.  You're the mortgage payment.  Hey.  He doesn't want to be the car payment.  I'm the hooker payment, which is more than the mortgage.  I'm a car combined.  Whoever's got the hooker payment to it, he is pleading my hero.  Oh.  Jesus.  I bet you my cock is bigger than Jet Li's. 
[02:20:30]  Hi, big dick daddy.  Oh.  Hi.  Wow.  How's it going, man?  What's up, man?  Cool.  How you doing?  Good.  I got a day off today, so I figured I'd come down and see you.  On your way to the dentist, stay home.  Nice.  Dude, you smoke them right down to the filter.  Hold.  You know.  I'm a doctor, so.  Are you really a doctor?  Yeah.  Dr. Death.  A doctor of what?  I'm the only one with a tie in this crew, shockingly enough.  What kind of doctor are you?  Yeah, what kind of doctor?  Idiotrician.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, that is a frightening thing.  You love kids, right?  You want to shake my hand?  No.  Right? 
[02:21:00]  Don't want to shake your hand touching kids.  He looks like he just cleans their penises very slowly.  Yeah.  You must be that 10th doctor.  What?  Because 9 out of 10 of you say smoking's bad.  Smoking is great.  How else are you going to deal with screaming kids all day?  You got to have sex with them.  Maybe.  That's Jimmy's job, though, isn't it?  No, I don't like kids on any level.  I could never fucking care for that reason.  Are you really?  That little young, tight buttocks?  Oof.  Not for you?  Sir, I think your career could end right here if you're not careful. 
[02:21:30]  Are you really a pediatrician, or are you kidding?  Yeah, I got my ID if you want to see it.  No, because then I'll blurt your name out.  Pediatrician character.  I wonder what's on that computer hard drive.  Exactly.  Gary Glitter would blush.  Hey, you know, a guy's got to have fun somehow.  Oh, shit.  You are a creep.  He really is.  Oh, he certainly is.  We love seeing him.  All right.  He got into that job for the wrong reasons.  Oh, absolutely.  What's up, sir?  Oh, my God.  You think he really is a doctor? 
[02:22:00]  I hope he's not a pediatrician.  No, he had his idea, bet.  Oh.  He was a smoking, pedo-looking creep.  He dropped something.  Yeah.  Where's the, I think, out of the bag?  Miss?  God, it's so bad.  Really, really bad.  Wake up. 
[02:22:30]  You speak good English.  That was the best line, Jimmy.  I wasn't saying it to be racist.  No, no, it wasn't even that.  It was just, you didn't speak properly.  Well, I was just impressed with the fact that the guy comes from China and is now doing,  like, I took two years of French and I remember none of that dumb language.  You can't say anything.  No, so to come and actually have to communicate and do a film in another language is very impressive.  It would be very hard.  I mean, if I had to do Rucky Rui in a different language. 
[02:23:00]  All right, let's go inside.  We're in.  We're going in.  We're going in.  Bye, guys.  Thanks, man.  Later, gentlemen.  Nice crowd today.  A little entourage follows us.  Somebody threw up behind the desk in a giant tile.  Why aren't you nice to this gentleman?  He's a cunt.  Just today.  Just be nice.  Say hi.  Say something to him.  All right.  Say hi, sir, or something nice.  Make his day.  Just today.  I think it'll help.  Just for today.  There you go.  I think it would help a lot. 
[02:23:30]  Jimmy.  Right there.  Anything?  All right.  Hi, sir.  How are you today?  Hello, sir.  Hello.  Hi.  Jimmy.  Jimmy.  Jimmy.  You're mean.  Fucking rat.  All right.  All right.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Blah, blah.  I'll see you upstairs.  Opie and Anthony XM202.  Messicans.  That sucks.  Lesbians.  I like that in a woman.  Read every other kind of TV.  I love paying for sex.  This moral decay. 
[02:24:00]  Huh?  Weakens our resistance.  Dude.  The onslaught of the communist masters of defeat.  We're a bunch of scumbags.  These abnormalities are corrupting the minds and the hearts of our children.  Jackass.  I can't believe it.  Pedophile humor.  Woo.  It's depressing and horrendous.  It's awful.  It's a bunch of idiots.  Perversion.  What?  Here it comes.  Here it comes.  The Opie and Anthony program.  The virus.  The Opie and Anthony.  God, that irritates me.  It's just like somebody took a bath to my brain. 
[02:24:30]  We're the only radio show that makes you want to hate us.  Opie.  I want my coffee.  Anthony.  I want that back.  Jim Northen.  I want Ozzy.  We are going to dumb this thing down to the point that we're going to be number one with  Down syndrome children.  No, baby.  It's terrible.  The Opie and Anthony show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  guitar solo 
[02:25:00]  guitar solo 
[02:25:30]  I don't know. I guess I don't need them. 
[02:26:00]  They're usually plugged somewhere in  here, but I  don't need them. Opie, are you talking?  Is somebody  talking? Because I couldn't tell if they were.  Mars is like...  Alright, we're here  for the second half of the  Opie and Anthony.  Oh, sorry, Opie. I'm talking Opie of show.  I'm sorry. I wouldn't be if I had  headphones, but  apparently they're still all wrapped up 
[02:26:30]  in the cabinet.  Yeah, why would they be out?  Why would they, Jim?  Why would they be out for you?  Why would they?  Are those your headphones, though?  Look, it says Anthony only on there.  Why would they be out for you?  There we go.  That wasn't so hard.  I really enjoyed that last segment over there.  Jed Lee?  Yeah, I mean, it was funny.  We were just talking when he first came in.  It's a little awkward because you don't know somebody,  but that was fun.  It was a little awkward  when he first walked in 
[02:27:00]  before we turned the mics on.  Well, that's why I wanted to do it.  And he sat down.  To get a weird...  Get that out of the way.  Sometimes a couple of minutes helps  because you just talk to the person  and you're like, alright.  Yeah.  You might get something to talk about on the air.  A lot of times you don't,  but at least you've spoken to them  for a couple of minutes.  Sometimes not good  because you've talked about it already  off the air  and it's hard to recapture a moment.  I hate that.  Like when you make small talk  with somebody that's sitting there  and it goes so well  and they come out with something good  and then you're like,  shit, I'm never going to be able  to recreate that on the air.  And then on the air,  you're like, 
[02:27:30]  I'll just go into it.  We were just talking...  What are you doing?  This is how I get to it.  I'm really good.  I'll go, you know, it's funny.  We were talking in the break about it.  Yeah, I saw you did that.  We were talking...  During the break...  During the break.  I'll say something like,  well, we were...  Talking, um...  Things we were discussing,  a couple of items.  What, Opie?  I've accepted my fate. 
[02:28:00]  Look at that.  What is...  Where...  Oh, a defeated picture.  That is great.  See a moment that didn't air  in Howard Stern's 60 Minutes interview.  What is it?  I've accepted my fate.  I've accepted my fate.  A half a billion dollars  and no listeners.  It was an even trade.  Could someone get us that audio?  Let's find out what that is.  Please.  I've accepted my fate.  Let's go to Rich in South Carolina.  Rich. 
[02:28:30]  Hey, boys.  Hey.  I wanted to call you out on the...  I was just cracking my...  I was just laughing so hard.  When you...  All I could think about  with the director that was talking,  all I could think about  when you did that prank  on that Chinese restaurant  and you had green poopies,  I just laughed for about 20 minutes.  How about green poopies?  It's really...  It was really, really hard  to not start laughing.  Why are we so racist?  I don't know.  It's not that...  I don't know.  I don't have a lot of Chinese people  in my life. 
[02:29:00]  It's like...  So...  I don't even see it as racism.  I just see it as like...  It's funny.  It's funny.  I don't care who it's done on or to  or what cultural racial group  or anything.  It's just everybody can gather around  a good funny joke based on race.  And, you know,  when you have to hold back,  when you got to bite that tongue,  oh, that's hard.  They were beyond cool, though.  Bite the tongue  or he would have ripped it out  with your heart.  You could have watched your heart beat  as he hit it with your tongue. 
[02:29:30]  A guy like that  you don't even want to fuck with, though.  I mean,  because he's just like...  I love his stuff.  I mean, I've watched him enough times.  So, how do you not enjoy what he does?  And what I...  And I hate saying this  because it sounds like  a maudlin old Vegas thing to say,  but he's a class act.  He's a very nice dude, man.  Classy guy.  Go fuck with him.  He's the guy...  And he just...  I've watched it.  He fights literally  30 motherfuckers at a time.  It's just fun to watch.  It is in a movie.  Oh, and go on.  Cut it out with...  Stop breaking the 30-second wall. 
[02:30:00]  That's my business.  It's a drama...  It's a dramatization.  Oh, I don't know.  I love when they go kicking 30 guys' asses  with just shit around the room.  But they're not really kicking ass  because it's a dramatization.  Got a chair.  I got a bookshelf.  No, no.  I got a spaghetti colander.  I could kick 80 people's asses with these.  But it's a dramatization.  Love it.  Oh, I don't know, Opie.  I think that's false.  It's just a dramatization.  Oh, I don't know.  Vinny in Jersey.  Of course.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Hey, I'm sorry, Vinny.  I'm sorry ahead of time. 
[02:30:30]  What?  Go on now.  Go ahead.  Yeah, guys.  Hey.  It's extremely...  You guys suck.  It's extremely entertaining as a listener  to hear you guys beat up on CERN.  Extremely.  It's funny as hell.  And it's extremely entertaining.  There is no but.  Really?  You used to listen to him kill everybody.  Bro, it's funny as hell.  I used to listen to that idiot kill everybody,  and it was entertaining when he did it.  Well, let me tell you, it only gets brought up  when it's true, and when something pops up in the news 
[02:31:00]  that's funny, that should be addressed.  I've got to tell you, the reaction I got  when Anthony was doing the whole paranoid conspiracy thing  over the Harry Nielsen song.  Howie.  What was the name of that Harry Nielsen song again?  Thanks.  I have no clue.  All right.  But my email went nuts from radio people  all over the country.  They all loved it.  It was hilarious.  And they're emailing it around in the industry.  And the fact that I wrote all the bits and stuff.  I'm quick as though you talk while I'm trying to be silly. 
[02:31:30]  All right, Vinny.  Thank you.  Take care.  All right, guys.  Good speed.  I didn't mean to jump in with your joke.  I never realized how many people talk over us  until that bit came about.  Until the genius of Jimmy.  I was just trying to be funny with my good buddy, Anthony.  But, you know, why would I want to do that?  Why bother?  Somebody else has something to repeat.  Yeah, jump into the fire.  That's right.  Harry Nielsen.  Jump into the fire.  Listen to this, will you?  Easterly winds will be very strong, too.  And that will cause coastal flooding,  very dangerous rip currents, as well as... 
[02:32:00]  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Is that a good faux pas?  She shoots.  She scores.  Wow.  Rip cunts.  Whoopee, whoopee.  Wow.  Who the hell is she?  She must be dating a black gentleman.  What does she think she is?  Goddamn rich cunts!  Jeff Goldblum?  Easterly winds will be very strong, too,  and that will cause coastal flooding,  very dangerous rip currents,  as well as very high... 
[02:32:30]  Goddamn rip cunts!  That's Rip Torren's actual brother.  Rip cunts.  That's a hell of a storm.  Oh, did she try to...  No, I gotta hear it again.  I'm gonna...  Did she try to backpedal?  It went so quick.  Rip cunts.  Rip currents.  Oh, shit, I'm fired.  Fuck.  She dropped a C-bomb.  Right there.  What rip cunts.  I wonder if she'll be fired for that,  like the guy who said Martin Luther Kuhn.  Let's see if she's fired.  Did she get fired?  What's the story?  Who is it?  I don't know the story in that clip.  I gotta be honest with you. 
[02:33:00]  Danny, any info?  Danny seems to know everything.  It's a surprise to everybody.  Danny doesn't know it all.  Danny.  Not in this case, though.  I don't know why.  He's strambling.  Hey, Sam, you gotta...  He's just looking around for help.  Oh, you got Sam so good right there.  Of course I did.  Help me.  That's very funny.  Help me.  No, Danny doesn't know.  Fucking Sam's G.I. Joe hairdo makes me sick.  G.I. Joe.  Kung fu retard.  Fucking holds a lollipop and won't let it go.  Hi, I'm G.I. Joe.  I'm here to defend your land. 
[02:33:30]  Are you?  From what?  Masculinity.  What did you say about Sam's hair today?  Great American hero.  He looks like asparagus.  That was amazing.  Then he does.  Asparagus head.  I want to eat Sam and then piss a smelly tinkle all over Travis's feet while Fan practices  judo on them.  I don't know what that means.  My fucking Fan didn't pipe up when Jet Li was in, I noticed.  Normally he talks a lot of shit, but he's fucking minded his P's and Q's.  I want to say half the stuff on the air, you're saying off mic there, man.  No dry irony when fucking Mr. Li was in.  That's right.  Where's Master Paul? 
[02:34:00]  I do want to ask him about Jet Li, because Paul is a very honest martial artist.  I want to ask him.  Oh, let's get his music.  This is Opie's, by the way, one of Opie's favorite segments.  Oh, God.  This is the post-segment of the program.  That's when you think the show can be a little boring.  Let me tell you what's going on with Master Paul.  What?  What's going on?  I'm in the wrong business.  You dressed up for Jet Li today.  Be honest. 
[02:34:30]  You were hoping to meet Jet Li and you put on your best suit.  Yeah, that would have been nice, but unfortunately, that didn't happen.  Ah, you were over on this side.  Yes, I was.  But is that the reason why you got the nice suit, right?  The nicest suit I've seen you wear, by the way.  Yes.  Thank you, Opie.  This is your Jet Li suit, isn't it?  This is my Jet Li suit.  I know it.  Damn.  I was hoping that he would say, Master Paul, come on, let's fight.  Whoa.  Roll Tide.  Now, I just want to know, because I like him, you're a martial artist. 
[02:35:00]  He's great, right?  He's amazing.  Would you be intimidated to fight him?  No.  Look at, like, no hesitation.  He just said, no.  No, even Club Soda Kenny said it before.  The style of training that he received was wushu, gongfu, and that's all prearranged.  Now, not to say that he can't use that against someone that's attacking him, but the fact  is that he has concentrated strictly on prearranged movement, as opposed to, you know, figuring  out how to go along. 
[02:35:30]  Being spontaneous when a guy comes at you with a broken bottle.  Yeah.  But, you know, make no mistakes.  He's very good.  Would you be intimidated by Chuck Norris?  No.  No?  Chuck Norris is a joke.  No, no, no, no.  That's why I'm asking him.  Chuck Norris is one of my idols.  And, again, he's incredible.  I want, he's, in his younger days, he was amazing.  But it's not a matter of just being intimidated.  It's respecting these martial artists that have done so much for the martial arts.  No, I mean, on a factor of being like that, like, I would respect an older comic. 
[02:36:00]  But, I mean, if you had to fight him now, would he be a problem for you?  Anytime that you're fighting someone that is better than you, it would be an honor.  Anyone that has been in the martial arts longer than you have, it's always an honor.  Win, lose, or draw.  It doesn't matter.  It's an honor.  I think it would be an older guy now.  I think Chuck is a little old to be really mixing it up.  Well, his spinning back kick was...  Like no other, man.  Oh, my...  Yeah.  His spinning back kick was the best in the business.  Well, basically, what Poe is saying now is that Chuck Norris was good. 
[02:36:30]  And, basically, now you'd kind of slap him around a little bit.  It's like a bitch.  You don't want to say it.  But Poe is basically saying he'd put a dress on old Chucky boy instead of fucking packing.  That's what our friend Poe is saying.  No, no, no, no.  No, I wouldn't say that.  Chuck Norris is...  He's still in shape.  I'm sure he trains all the time.  And I don't think he's as fast as he used to be.  Well, who is, really?  Yeah.  But his spinning back kick, I'm telling you right now, it was incredible.  Does anybody remember Laka?  Boring.  What?  All right, Master Poe. 
[02:37:00]  Thank you.  I actually wanted to know.  Okay.  We did need to know.  I was curious from a martial artist.  I was curious about him.  And Kenny gave pretty much 10 minutes to you dude.  Yes.  Thanks, guys.  All right, sweetie.  Why didn't you walk over there?  Yeah, why didn't you come over and meet him if you wanted to?  Taking a stroll over.  He really did put on his best suit because he thought he was going to meet Jet Li.  It's not like every day you're doing that.  I like to call him Jet Li, though, because the L.I.  That's how...  No, China.  China does it differently?  No, it doesn't.  I called him Jet Long Island.  How do you think I felt?  Oh, that's silly. 
[02:37:30]  Abbreviation humor always works.  Does it?  Poe.  Yes?  You've got to talk to someone.  You should have walked over there so you could get a picture with Jet Li.  Yeah, we all took pictures with him.  You can't assume that he's going to make the walk.  I was hoping he was going to because I figured you'd want to meet him.  Well, that would have been nice, but I have a job here, and I'm taking care of everything  over here at XM.  It wasn't a while you could come over, man.  You could take 5, 10 minutes to go over there and get a picture with one of your heroes  or someone you look up to.  I feel bad, to be completely honest with you. 
[02:38:00]  You should have called Don or somebody and arranged that.  Tomo.  Tomo arigato.  I can have a good name.  Mr. Roboto.  Bato.  Yeah, that's thank you.  I like when Mr. Roboto and he goes, machine or man, and then they go, secret, secret,  a secret, secret.  I got a secret, secret.  No, you don't.  Yes, it's not a secret.  What happened?  I don't know.  What's everybody pointing at, fucking bear?  I was going to say, Chuck Lydell's coming in tomorrow.  I'm poking.  Well, Chuck Lydell is an animal.  He's in the ring. 
[02:38:30]  Animal in the ring.  Me and Chuck might have a problem, though.  Yeah, sure.  If I have to tangle with Chuck.  Yeah, there'll be a problem, all right.  Chuck's the type of guy, if he was hitting on your girlfriend, you'd go, you know what?  If you want to fuck her, I won't get in the way.  It's like, you got to, but you got to stand up and be a man by saying, because there's nothing  I could do about it.  I'd bully her.  Um, excuse me.  You fuck him.  Everyone knows I don't like, um, starting trouble.  Well, of course you don't.  You're a good boy.  I'm usually a very good boy, and I don't like starting trouble, but. 
[02:39:00]  Are ya?  You're a sweetie.  I, uh, figure that, uh, Master Poe should see what they're writing on the pad data right  now.  What'd they write on the pad data?  Well, uh, I guess Master Poe's name is now Mr. Pooh.  Who wrote Mr. Pooh?  They do make sport of you at times, Master Poe.  That's the good-natured laugh before somebody gets a fish off the table.  Gums are neat out.  All right.  Two seconds, it's over. 
[02:39:30]  Excuse me, we're forgetting about the clip.  This girl's a fat pussy.  The clip?  The greatest clip ever.  Oh, shit.  The rip, uh, the rip cunts.  Let's listen in.  Uh, Bill from Waterford.  Where did his go?  Here it is.  Rip cunts.  Ten point damage.  Ten point.  Ten point damage.  Ten point damage.  Here it is again.  Easterly winds will be very strong, too, and that will cause coastal flooding, very dangerous  rip currents, as well as very high surf.  We could see...  Wow.  I gotta know when that happened. 
[02:40:00]  We don't know anything else about that.  Is there a video on YouTube?  I wanna see her face.  I wanna feel what she felt at that moment.  The hot redness that came into her face.  The sweat.  How she gotta keep going with the forecast.  Only throbbing in her head.  I just said cunt.  I just said cunt.  Yes, sir.  You're an intern here, right?  Yes, I am.  It's channel out in the barracks! 
[02:40:30]  Sorry.  I have no idea what your name is.  What is it?  Oh, I got you a marble cake.  Tony, I thought you said you weren't gonna forget me.  See?  He went home thinking that you were gonna...  Yeah, I thought I was cool.  And now I feel you're trying to make me feel bad.  No, I would never do this.  This guy's trying to make me feel like what I did over here.  That I don't remember your name.  It was a whole weekend that passed.  Yeah, I know.  What's up, Pete?  No, I was just gonna say that, you guys.  I pulled it off of YouTube, but apparently it's not there anymore. 
[02:41:00]  I did it Friday.  Son of a bitch.  And I can't find it.  It might be.  Copywritten material.  Yeah, I know.  You're really getting a little drastic with that whole copywritten material thing.  Yes.  You know what would make me remember your name?  What's that?  Tony, if you got me another piece of marble cake.  I will find the best marble cake in Manhattan.  Atta boy, Frankie.  Here we go.  Yeah?  I want marble cake.  Do you?  Cakey, not flaky.  I say I remember.  Oh, the guy knows cakey, not flaky.  Tony, my friend.  You know something? 
[02:41:30]  Get yourself a little piece of marble cake yourself.  It looks like you could use it.  Oh, come on.  He's a big boy.  Peter in Massachusetts.  Peter.  Thank you, Tony.  Good morning.  Good morning.  I was wondering why Master Poe was saying thank you in Japanese.  when Jet Li is Chinese.  Because he wasn't saying it for...  Go ahead.  Because he studies the Japanese ways of kicking ass. 
[02:42:00]  Thank you in Chinese, in Cantonese.  It's basically...  When I study the art of the Japanese...  Stop.  All right.  Thanks, Peter.  I had such an embarrassing moment.  If I can add something to that.  Whenever you're studying any discipline, you try to learn the thank you in all disciplines.  So that's just...  And that was for your discipline.  Don't worry.  Gattu gozaimasu.  Boring, I know. 
[02:42:30]  Digger Dog from Akron, Ohio.  Rip cunts is what big-headed Down syndrome babies do.  That was not nice.  Oh, jeepers.  You want to talk about embarrassing?  I'm looking at Hustler, which I just adore.  And there's pictures in here.  I've seen this one already.  You're in it?  Of a black guy, Mandingo, who has a 14-inch dick, and he's putting it in a white girl.  And I was looking at this, and I actually blurted out, lucky girl.  Oh, you didn't.  I know.  I just figured I'd go for a joke, which...  How deep is he burying that thing?  Don't try to bail me out, Ant. 
[02:43:00]  You're a good friend.  I just bombed horribly.  That's why I love Anthony.  He's just trying to help me out.  He's trying to casually throw me a rope ladder so I can fucking crawl out of the humiliating  bomb I just put myself in.  But you know what?  I deserve to languish in the muck.  Fuck it.  I blurted out, lucky girl!  Pull over, folks.  More gems on the way.  Let me just help you carry the load.  He probably has about nine inches buried in there.  Nine?  Yeah.  Guys, Jimmy Schubert's on the line. 
[02:43:30]  Cool.  Jimmy Schubert.  Last we saw him, he was at the Camden show.  That's right.  The O&A Traveling Virus show down there in Philly, in Camden, New Jersey.  Jimmy Schubert.  Hey, guys.  How are you?  What's up?  Hey, Jimmy.  Oh, Jesus.  What's up, buddy?  Oh, I hear her booze behind him.  Yeah.  It hasn't stopped.  I hear her booze behind him.  I hear her booze behind him.  You're booze behind him.  Jimmy. 
[02:44:00]  Is that a family function?  Now, I have to ask you, this is a comic.  You're walking out.  When did the booze start?  Probably about, I would say maybe a minute in.  Wow.  And when did you realize, like, this is a problem?  Yeah, dude, I realized immediately it was a problem.  I, you know, I didn't, you know, my mistake probably was not addressing it.  I thought I could power through it, but I don't, I didn't think it was, you know, what 
[02:44:30]  are you going to do?  I mean, I could have handled it another way and, you know, addressed it.  But then again, I, you know, I had this visual image of 10,000 beer bottles converging on  my skull, you know.  When did you realize that you wished your parents weren't in the front row?  Oh, man.  That was immediate.  You know, it's so funny.  I was in the, I was at the comedy store this weekend and I happened to be gone.  I went up right before Dom Herrera, you know.  Yeah.  So I'm actually bringing Dom onto the stage. 
[02:45:00]  And then after I introduced him, he passes me and goes, my God, Jimmy, it's amazing how  good you've gotten in the week.  Yeah, it's got to be said.  Jimmy Schubert did the show for us down there in Philly.  And I think it was even less than a minute.  They started booing.  They booed your whole set.  You tried to plow through, got nothing done.  I have to say, Jimmy Schubert is a really, really funny comic, but you got destroyed  down there.  Well, yeah.  Well, you know, the thing is like getting sucker punched, to tell you the truth. 
[02:45:30]  Yeah.  You know, I mean, I could take that about as personally as, I don't know.  I don't know.  Yeah, there was no reason for it.  All of a sudden, you just started getting booed out of nowhere.  What I think they thought was when the show was getting ready to get started, they thought  that maybe they thought maybe you guys were coming out or something.  And when they introduced me, and the fact is, you know, I've done the show a little bit,  but I don't know that, you know, they would, you know, I did the show Friday morning, but  I don't know that they know me from the show as a regular kind of guest.  They just kind of, I mean, I have no idea what, why that was, but I mean, in my hometown. 
[02:46:00]  I know.  Jimmy, how much family did you have there?  I had, I have six brothers, so yeah.  Oh, boy.  I mean, there was, two brothers weren't able to make it, but my nephew was there, and I  had, you know, I had about, probably about 12 people there.  Now, what happened after you, because I've had bad sets before, Jimmy, every comedian  does, obviously.  What happened when you walked off, like the first family you saw, what was going on?  Well, it was like, you know, I mean, obviously, I think I saw my, one of my brothers backstage, 
[02:46:30]  he went, wow, he just shook his head.  I think Jimmy's being polite.  At what point did your family change their last name?  Well, you know, the funny thing is, man, you know, obviously you have a, you know, everybody  has bad sets, you know, it's like, you know, I get the whole football field of stuff, and  that's kind of like a, you know, a smudge in the corner, you know, you can't really concentrate  on that bad thing, you just kind of keep going, you know.  There's a whole, there's a whole, there's a whole bunch of stuff, but yeah, that's what 
[02:47:00]  Dom said to me, because I actually flew back with Dom on that Monday, and he said, and  he goes, you, he goes, they, he goes, Jimmy, he goes, they jumped on you immediately, he  goes, with me, at least they listened to me seven minutes before they started doing  me, you know.  Yeah, Jimmy, it was a weird crowd down there, because you got booed, Dom Marrera got booed  near the end of his set, and then they went after Bill Burr immediately, and then, and  I, I, I gotta, I gotta ask, it's killing you that you didn't handle it like Bill Burr 
[02:47:30]  did, huh?  Well, you know, the thing is, Billy is a really funny guy, but Billy also had the advantage  of, of, of sitting back there and watching this kind of thing, and everybody said, well,  Jesus, if, if, you know, if they booed Dom and they booed me in our hometown, I mean,  that could go either way, you know.  Oh, yeah, so you, it was so unexpected with you.  I think, I think he geared up, yeah, he had time to say, okay, if they fuck with me, I am  coming back.  Because backstage, we were all going, wow, this crowd's a little different tonight, and  I'm sure the comedians, they'd really have to go out there and perform, and I would pretty 
[02:48:00]  much just kind of like, uh, introducing you guys, I, yeah, you're right, Bill Burr  was probably like, you know, if they, they do that shit to me, I'm, I'm gonna, I'm gonna  give it right back to him.  And Billy, and Billy told me when I come off, he goes, hey, is it too soon to tell you  about the time I got booed at the Beecher's Madhouse in Vegas?  Oh.  And I said, no, but I mean, you know, it's, I just, for me, I, I just totally didn't expect  it.  I mean, I, I don't know why.  I mean, that's just it.  I mean, I've been in some kind of fairy world, you know, fairy world, not to know that this  was a possibility of happening, but I mean, it was literally like getting sucker punched, 
[02:48:30]  and I, it really took me off my game.  I mean, I'm sitting there trying to, you know, you know, edit jokes in my head and get to  the, get to the funny quicker.  As you're hearing just booing going on, if, if, if two guys, you know, one walks in, gets  smashed in the face, like walks into a bar and just gets hit in the face.  And then another guy does the same thing and gets hit in the face.  The third guy that walks in is going to be ready for it.  You know, and I think Billy knew that if that happened to him, he was going to just come 
[02:49:00]  out swinging.  You got blindsided.  Yeah, and the other thing is, I mean, I don't, you know, I, I didn't, I also know that really  you got a great show there.  I mean, I had the show coming behind me.  I mean, you know, you got some of the best comedians, you got Bob Saget and Tracy Morgan  and, you know, Jimmy Norton and, you know, Don Myrara and Patrice and I'm going, well,  this is going to be a great show.  I was sitting there going, you know, if, you know, I just want to kind of, I thought maybe 
[02:49:30]  it was something I did.  I, I, it was really tough to assimilate, assimilate all the information.  So I just kind of, you know, kind of stepped out and cut it short, but I had no idea if  I, you know, maybe, maybe it was me or something I did, but I, in hindsight, I realized it wasn't.  I mean, I thought these people had a great show coming behind me.  They didn't want to.  No, we got to be fair.  It was just a strange night.  It was a strange crowd.  You did some great video for us, by the way, for MySpace.  Oh, yeah.  That was, that was, that was the other thing. 
[02:50:00]  You know, you had to do that.  But you're right.  I mean, these people were like, I mean, you know, this is Philadelphia.  Yeah.  I mean, these people booed Donovan McNabb, you know, when they picked him in a draft,  they booed Santa Claus and threw ice balls at him at Vette Stadium.  I mean, these people booed Darren Dalton and his kid on Father Sunday at Vette Stadium.  You know?  They loved the boo.  Wait, I didn't hear the last one, but I've heard the other ones, but I didn't hear that  last one.  What was that again?  Darren Dalton.  When he, when he brought Darren Dalton, he had his kid down there for Father Sunday at 
[02:50:30]  Vette Stadium and they booed him.  Oh, my God.  Oh, you bastard.  I've never heard that one before.  That is good.  That is a good one.  These guys, I mean, you know, these people down there, I mean, you know, they must have  been booing.  And it's so funny because I'm from Philly and I love the Eagles, but because of what  happened at the Twitter center, I was secretly, secretly rooting for them to lose.  So all those people in Philly would be upset about it, you know?  So it's so funny, you know, just in your hometown, they could be betrayed in your hometown like 
[02:51:00]  that.  It was just, you know, it was kind of brutal.  Did you go out to brunch the next day with your family?  No, no, no, no, Rob.  I was just trying to, you know, just trying to get through it.  That's a rough one, man.  Yeah, but, you know, what are you going to do?  Well, you know, it was one of those nights.  Yeah, you're nobody until you get booed in Philly.  You know what I mean?  I mean, you're going to get booed in Philly.  I mean, you're all in good company.  Right on.  All right, Jimmy, what are you promoting?  Anything? 
[02:51:30]  Well, yeah, I'm actually coming back at the end of the month.  It'll be the Stress Factory in New Jersey at the end of September.  Cool.  Stolen's throw from Philly.  Philadelphia people get your tickets.  Yeah.  Well, you know, being booed by 10,000 people wasn't nearly as bad as getting heckled by my  own mom for 20 straight minutes in Philly again.  What do you mean?  Well, I was doing a show down there, and my mom had had a couple of people.  I had a couple of drinks, and she came to one of my shows, and she started literally  heckling me for like 20 minutes straight. 
[02:52:00]  I mean, I didn't know.  There was another time I was looking at her going, it's my mom.  She's heckling me.  I mean, I'm in the middle of a show.  The club owner is sitting there going, I don't know, do I throw the guy's mom out?  Do I shut her up?  Do I ask her to leave?  I mean, the guy was like walking back and forth.  I finally had to tell my dad.  I said, listen, I love you guys.  A little bit.  Bob, scrub your bitch, all right?  I'm in the middle of the show.  That's kind of awkward.  Yeah, no kidding.  Yeah, no.  Awkward, all right, guys.  Nice, Jimmy.  All right, Jimmy, thank you so much.  Take care, buddy.  Jimmy Schubert, everyone. 
[02:52:30]  He's recovered.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I got a couple of pretzels.  I was going to say about the Jimmy Schubert thing, there's a video up on my, well, it's  YouTube, sorry, on YouTube of him getting booed, but it's only like 20 seconds.  It's not his whole set.  But Bill Burr attacking the crowd, but Bill Burr attacking the crowd, that whole set is up  on YouTube and being downloaded like crazy still.  It's almost up to like 100,000 views.  Wow.  The Bill Burr thing.  Actually, if you add up to two, because there's a few different versions of it, I think there's  at least two, maybe more, it's well over 100,000 views. 
[02:53:00]  Wow.  Bill Burr attacking the crowd down there at Camden.  Yeah, because that was a good one.  That was definitely good.  He laid into them.  It's the local weather girl here in New York, Ant.  Is it?  Yeah.  Audrey, what?  Puente.  Yeah.  Wow.  She's on every morning when I wake up.  Audrey Puente from Channel 2, right?  Channel 2 News.  She does the weather.  I don't know what she looked like right when it happened.  Well, the video's up on YouTube.  Oh.  You want to talk about a video that's going to be viewed a lot?  This one.  Here, turn to Ant. 
[02:53:30]  So this is her actually doing it?  That's the second time I did it.  Yeah.  All right, so that's her.  She's about to say it any second here.  Wow.  Good recovery.  A complete professional.  She is a pro.  I thought you'd see the panic in her face, but you don't.  You don't see anything.  You see the fucking, you see like that, what's that like map they have, that fucking 3D map?  All of a sudden a big cunt just shows up on it, and it's fucking torn with wind and 
[02:54:00]  trees blowing through it.  Easterly winds will be very strong, too, and that will cause coastal.  Yeah, she did have a baby recently, so maybe, maybe, I'm not even kidding.  That does tend to rip it up.  I've seen her in the neighborhood with the stroller and the kids, so I'm wondering maybe  there's something going on there behind the scenes that she's really, maybe she's just  really mad at the doctor or something.  Easterly winds will be very strong, too, and that will cause coastal flooding, very dangerous 
[02:54:30]  rip currents, as well as very high surf.  Wow, that wasn't even almost.  That was it.  That was a blatant cunt.  All right, we'll take a break.  Nice.  Let's, um, have a big surprise when we come back.  You do?  No, I was just trying to tease it.  I'm going to eat.  So people would stick with us.  This is horrible Marvel cake.  Get it in here.  I'll eat it.  I know you won't.  You're the boss.  What's bad about it?  Get shit taken in here.  I'll tell you what's bad about it.  I can see from here. 
[02:55:00]  Too greasy.  It's not flaky enough.  Wait, flaky not cakey.  No, it's cakey.  Or cakey not flaky.  Someone's name's about to be forgotten again.  Wait, cakey not flaky?  No, it can't be your fault.  I mean, it's Marvel cakey.  Wait, what's your saying?  I like cakey.  All right, yeah.  There's not enough cakey in there.  No, it's pretty cakey.  What don't you like about it, sweetie?  The taste itself.  Yeah.  Yeah?  It sort of tastes a little odd.  He's supposed to buy a piece of it.  It might be because I was eating a smoothie, drinking a smoothie, though, so I'll just continue  to eat it.  There's no spinach in here, right? 
[02:55:30]  That's all I need.  Way to go.  The boss works hard.  All he wants is a little piece of fucking cake.  Starbucks.  Starbucks.  Did they put on the plastic?  They tongued it.  I made sure his fingers didn't.  They tongued it?  They used tongs.  Oh, tongs.  I made sure that he didn't put any of his digits on it.  Thank you, sir.  All he had to do is a little marble cake to get him through the day.  That's good.  And you let him down.  No, now it's getting better because the taste, it must have been the smoothie.  I apologize.  You have to have not your fault.  Well, the dark side always wrecks it.  All right. 
[02:56:00]  And the marble cake.  I like the darky and the marble cake.  So what side wrecks it?  It's really the only place I like seeing this happening.  What would that be?  Light and dark coming together.  What?  Wait, wait.  To make goodness.  What would that be?  See, there's parts of a marble cake, and they call it marble cake because part of it is very light.  And part of it's dark.  And when you bring it together, you get, what do you get?  There you go. 
[02:56:30]  By the way, someone just did the quick math for us.  The Bill Burr video of him just trashing the Philly crowd.  10,000 people plus for, what, 11 minutes?  Something like that?  Yeah.  120,000 views.  Right.  It's only been up there a week.  120,000 views.  One of the most viewed comedy clips, by the way, last week. 
[02:57:00]  It was right up there.  That's one of the most viewed.  Wow.  Yeah, he did very well with that video on YouTube.  All right, we'll take a break, and we'll continue with some other things.  Sure, dropping out of school to become a stripper seems like a fun thing to do.  Heather.  Hello?  What?  Hello?  Hi, Heather.  Hello?  So, what do you want?  I want to come on the show again.  F-all.  What?  Die.  Hello?  What?  I want to come on the show again.  No!  What?  Never? 
[02:57:30]  Why not?  You're very boring, Heather.  What?  I'm boring?  Hello?  You're a certifiable lunatic.  What?  You are very, very, very annoying.  I'm annoying?  Yeah.  Wait a minute.  You guys don't like me?  You're a friggin' moron.  You're a stupid jerk.  You shut up.  Hello?  Hello?  What?  What?  You stupid bitch.  You are smarter than me, right?  Kiss my ass too, honey, because it's so sweet.  Shut up.  Yeah.  What?  You whore.  You don't want me to come back to the show? 
[02:58:00]  Is that what you're saying?  You're out of your mind.  Don't you listen to the show?  Whores are one-trick ponies.  Lee, Oakley, and Anthony Joe reminds you to please stay in school.  Uh-huh.  And I'm laughing historically like Matt.  You better stop.  Hey, watch that sound.  Everybody looks what you're going.  You better stop.  Hey, watch that sound.  Everybody looks what you're going down.  I just saw Budweiser, and I know this could be good. 
[02:58:30]  All right on.  This is Candy Skins.  Thanks.  We wanted this as a rejoiner.  I'm going to ask, by the way, on Friday, like I said, something that surprised the hell  out of everybody.  On Friday.  About the gay thing?  Shut up.  Surprised of no one.  On Friday, I played a song, For What It's Worth, from Candy Skins.  And I'm like, wow, man, I heard this cool new song on Ethel, and blah, blah, blah. 
[02:59:00]  I want to turn you guys on to it.  It's almost from, like, 92.  Really?  Yeah, I never heard it before, though.  So it's Candy Skins, and For What It's Worth.  Jimmy's going to play a song today, right, Jimmy?  Oh, okay.  But no one took my song choice.  No, I had the song choice Friday.  No, no, I no one took my song choice from today.  Well, write it down.  I'm scared.  On a secret ballot.  Ooh.  So we're all surprised later.  All right. 
[02:59:30]  All right, what do we got in front of us here?  How the fuck is this?  What?  I don't understand.  Oh, the picture, the freaking, this is great.  Somebody, thank you so much.  This is Tom from Jersey.  It says, Steve, one of my wife's friends went to school with a little Jimmy.  His senior picture is classic Jimmy.  I'd like to know what his scribblings mean.  Yeah, what his scribblings mean.  Apparently, there's a page with his picture. 
[03:00:00]  I see that.  That is a great shot, Jimmy.  That is a fucking, that is the picture they put in the paper after you climb up a tower and kill people.  You look kind of crazed.  Tilted forehead.  Did the photographer grab your chin and turn your head to the side and go, okay, hold it?  Probably.  You have a nice head of hair going there, parted in the middle. 
[03:00:30]  I do.  It doesn't look bad at all.  My picture's a lot worse.  But you look very serious.  I was studious.  Were you?  No, I dropped out after a suicide attempt.  That was a melodramatic bucket of jism.  Did you know Charlene Osborne?  I knew all of them.  I didn't know them well, but I mean, I knew her.  What do you know about Charlene Osborne?  I like her last name.  I knew that.  Of course.  Well, that's why I'm asking, because these are all the same people.  These are the people that are on the same page as you.  And I like the fact that her first name was in Full Metal Jacket as the weapon. 
[03:01:00]  Okay.  Dahlia.  Dahlia could have.  Who was the goer on this page?  Charlene, Karen, or Dahlia?  Dahlia Nochi or Karen.  I don't think any of them were, to be honest, because I never got laid in high school.  Yeah.  I finally got laid my senior year.  I had sex with a girl I was dating who was a freshman.  It wasn't with Zachary Newman on this page one?  Or Glenna Bando, who was actually a good buddy of mine in school.  Oh, really?  Yeah, he was a nice dude.  What's he doing now?  I haven't talked to any of them.  20 years anniversary is coming up.  I wouldn't know most of them if they walked in here with their fucking pictures.  Are you going to go? 
[03:01:30]  Why would I?  For what?  I don't know.  No.  Rub it in?  Maybe.  Rub what in?  I'm a fucking nobody with white socks.  Come on.  You're on Lucky Louie.  You're on the radio show.  Lucky Louie.  I'm sure people will remember that in 10 years.  Oh, yeah.  You were on that one thing.  One year that they showed that.  I remember you.  We're holding out hope.  They're going to pick up a second season, Jimmy.  Oh, I know.  Keep hope alive.  We're keeping hope alive.  All right.  So what does this mean?  Let me see you, sweetie. 
[03:02:00]  Oh, yeah.  They edited this very badly.  A lot of my stuff, because I was kind of into that notice me devil worship shit.  So I wrote stuff about the devil that they took out.  What did they take out?  I don't remember.  You don't remember?  All hail Satan, I think.  Why would they put your apartment and home address in these things?  Because he wasn't famous.  No.  For anybody.  That's an invasion of privacy.  So you could write them after the school year is over and keep in touch.  So you could get that frigging stalking started right away on some of the hot girls. 
[03:02:30]  That just seems odd.  It actually is.  It definitely is odd.  Some of these people have nothing.  This guy Christopher has, like, his address, and that's it.  But you added in these little things.  Ooh, that was disgusting.  I shouldn't have done that on air.  Yeah.  What is...  Well, we know what Ozzy means.  So what?  This is just all your favorites?  Yeah, but I don't remember what they edited.  It starts off.  It's got my name, my address, and the first thing I write is Ozzy, of course. 
[03:03:00]  And then I put the king.  Oh, the king.  Which might have been a reference to Ozzy.  I just don't remember.  And then it's dash.  There's a dash between everything.  Like, it's Ozzy.  Dash.  The king.  And then the king.  But the and king is together in one word.  So it looks like the king.  I don't know why it's like that.  It looks like someone spelled something wrong, and it's the king.  Dash.  Budweiser.  That is so weird to see.  What a simple, simple man. 
[03:03:30]  Budweiser.  Dash.  Run.  Run.  Oh, Mick.  Run.  Oh.  It should have been Run DMC.  I don't know why they fucked it up.  Run something.  Oh, I don't know what that means.  Run of DMC.  Or is that Dougie Fresh?  It's a combination.  It's Run O-M-C.  Mick.  Dougie.  Maybe they fucking mixed it up.  Run DMC.  Dougie Fresh. 
[03:04:00]  Because I was going to rap.  Venom.  Of course you are.  Fate.  From Merciful Fate.  Dash.  Fate.  Dash.  Small dash.  O.  I don't know.  O-H.  They probably edited shit.  Oh, Hail Satan.  That's probably what they took out of there.  Oh, Hail Satan.  Dash.  M-M-E-L-I-N-K-E-R.  Short for Madam Linker, who was my French teacher my first two years of high school.  And she was one of the people who was really nice to me when I was in high school. 
[03:04:30]  So I really loved her.  She was very, very nice to me.  And I was like a lonely fucking nobody of a student.  She treated me nicely.  You certainly were.  She was very sweet.  You can look at this whole page.  Everyone's is pretty much the same.  Some people use capital letters.  Others use initials.  But basically the same little things.  What they're into.  Blah, blah, blah.  Jimmy's is this standout thing with these dashes.  They edited so much out of there, man.  Any type of devil worship shit they edited. 
[03:05:00]  There's a lot of it.  Dash.  Bones.  Don't remember what that was.  Bill's Homegrown.  My buddy Bill D'Angelo fucking grew.  He had maybe a 400.  It was like a fucking redwood pot plant in his back.  And we would always go and, you know, Bill would always provide the homegrown in a pipe.  And we would go out and get high.  And then it says Frank, dash, Tyler, dash, Joe, dash, the best. 
[03:05:30]  They were my best friends.  The best FG?  Probably Frank Greco.  I was putting my initials in my friends.  Frank was one of my best friends.  And then what's his big, long...  A bunch of them.  TW was Tyler Wilson.  JF was Joe Ferrino.  DJ, I don't remember.  But why did you put them all together like that?  Oh, because I was a douche?  I don't remember.  Maybe they just did that in final.  I don't know why.  Dash. 
[03:06:00]  Thanks, PF.  What's PF?  Probably Paula Ferrino.  She was a girl.  She was Joe's little sister who I had a big crush on and I was kind of obsessive with.  Aw.  Yeah, she was very nice to me, too.  I was just a piece of shit.  And then, dash, and MND, and Mom and Dad, dash, evil.  Evil.  I don't know what it means.  Just dash, evil, ended the whole thing.  I wasn't evil.  I was just a jerk off.  And look at you.  You are...  You don't look like... 
[03:06:30]  You don't look like the evil guy.  You don't look like the...  Those were tinted glasses, by the way, that I'm wearing.  Oh, okay.  They were very dommerish.  You saw the color.  Yes.  Oh, they're very nice.  I was more handsome than I remember in high school.  I hated myself in high school.  But looking back, I realized...  I wasn't dishy.  But I was better than I thought I was.  Like, right now, I'm kind of, like, cute and sweet.  I like to show my calves off.  Because girls like my calves.  Could have gotten more girls if you tried a little harder back then.  I don't know.  I don't know. 
[03:07:00]  Let's go to Ashley in North Carolina.  Ashley.  Ashley.  Yes.  Yes.  Hi, girl's name.  What's up?  It's fucking...  Hey.  What?  Little Jimmy Buttercup Norton.  Hi.  You're a good boy, man.  Yeah.  Thank you, man.  Just say Ash.  That way we know it's not Ashley.  We think it's a girl.  Does it say Ashley on your driver's license?  Yeah, it does.  That's all.  Thanks a lot.  It's like Evil Dead Ashley is cool because it's Ash.  There is Ashley in the first movie and they kind of made fun of it. 
[03:07:30]  But Ashley is a...  Ashley is such a girl's name, dude.  Like, explain this to me.  It's like a guy's...  It's like, no, guys are called Ashley.  It's like saying a guy's called Brenda.  There's just not...  It's probably like a southern male's name.  What?  In the north, there's...  You don't get that in the north.  In the south.  In the nowhere.  In the nowhere.  So what's up, Ashley?  Besides...  I don't know where Jimmy's coming down to North Carolina.  I'm not sure, girl's name.  I was debating heading down there.  But maybe you and your buddies, you know, Mary and June can come to the show. 
[03:08:00]  Actually, Mary and June, fucking three hardcore bikers down there.  And you can bring your chicks, Joe, Fred, and Teddy.  D-E-D-Y, not I, by the way, for Teddy.  T-E-D-D-I with a heart over the I.  Oh, wow.  I don't know.  I don't have any North Carolina plans.  I'll get down there eventually.  I'm concerned with Cleveland this week.  And then I think...  I don't know where I am the week after Cleveland.  I'm going to say Pittsburgh, but I...  You are in Pittsburgh. 
[03:08:30]  Well, they got a lot of good places up in Raleigh.  So I just wanted to know if you...  Thank you, buddy.  So I go from Cleveland to Pittsburgh.  It's basically from mullet to mullet.  I go from mullet to rat tail.  Damn it, that would have been funny if I didn't amend it.  The mullet to mullet comedy tour.  The mullet to mullet.  Yeah.  I'm just touching my cock.  I'm going to put a stop to that real quick.  That goddamn McGreevy story.  Ugh.  He's touching even more now.  I'm not, Opie.  That's a pack of lies.  Actually, we got the new Fox sitcom. 
[03:09:00]  Um...  Oh, damn it.  What?  I just wanted to read some McGreevy things.  But we're going to get some audio of this.  He was on Oprah.  I guess they taped it.  They returned some transcripts.  And it's about him and his first little romp with this guy.  What's the line, Anthony?  I read it on the transcript where he goes, Oprah, to put it plainly, I look at cock the  way you look at a watermelon.  And they both laughed and high-fived.  Because they both knew what they were talking about. 
[03:09:30]  They both love them the same size.  Except you spit the seeds out and I swallow them.  Uh, well, this is what the guy, this is the guy's response to what McGreevy said.  Because McGreevy said it was some beautiful thing and, uh, it was one of his, um, I hate  to use the word, but one of his aides.  It was, uh, somebody who I guess he had put in a position to work for him, besides doggy  style.  Oh, Lance, stop with the talk. 
[03:10:00]  I know.  And, um, he said it was, uh, it was very hard for him to, to come out of the closet like  this.  And one, one night, I guess he hooked up with this guy.  And, uh, they, they started kissing the aide, alleged ex-lover, and the McGreevy scandal.  Uh, let's see.  Let's see, replace the, McGreevy had a van.  One, the van's middle seat replaced with a mattress so he could fall asleep. 
[03:10:30]  The van's middle seat replaced with a plunger with a fucking mushroom on it.  Uh, both men fell asleep, but, uh, Sipple, the other guy, said he was awoken by what he  thought was someone pulling on his right leg.  In fact, he said it was McGreevy touching him inappropriately.  He should have went into, jeep, jeep, jeep, jeep, jeep, jeep, jeep.  Jeep, jeep, jeep, jeep.  It was a surrealistic scene.  I go in a New Jersey vehicle and three state troopers, and there is a governor lying on 
[03:11:00]  the floor rubbing himself at my leg like a dog, the ex-aide said.  Uh, Sipple said that when he got to Washington, he told McGreevy, don't ever do that again.  Then I went to the toilet and vomited.  Hmm.  Did you?  In early 2002, he said McGreevy masturbated in bed in front of him with the governor's  wife in the kitchen.  Who gets into these situations?  While recovering from a broken leg.  What do you do when there's a governor jerking off with a broken leg looking at you? 
[03:11:30]  What do you do?  Out of respect, do you stand there for the state?  You show me a backside just for taxes?  Well, Dina McGreevy...  No masturbation without representation.  They'd dump tea in the harbor for that.  Sorry, Andrew.  No, that's fine.  It's all written down.  I could always go back to it.  While Dina McGreevy was in the hospital, the former governor tried to push him down on  the bed, Sipple said.  He pushed my chest and I fell on the bed.  The governor was absolutely crazy, he said.  And the McGreevy book, The Confession, recalls the encounter differently as a passionate kiss 
[03:12:00]  that, quote, sent me through the roof.  That's the actual clip, the transcript we need.  Because it talks about how McGreevy and this guy hooked up, they got together and started  kissing out of nowhere.  And, uh, they both got nude and, uh, crawled into bed and McGreevy had said, uh, yeah, that 
[03:12:30]  it sent him through the roof.  It was one of the most passionate, memorable, sexual moments of his life as they made love.  You know, he's such a bottom.  You know, go on.  He's a fag.  I bet you McGreevy likes his legs pushed back and he likes to hear the smacking of another  man's lips as his asshole is being filled with a telephone pole.  He likes to hear the gentle smacking of another gentleman's lips. 
[03:13:00]  Oh, God.  What's going through your mind when you're just hearing a loose bag slapping your ass going  I'll tell you what's probably going through your mind.  Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.  Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.  Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

[03:19:30]  hear them fading up the left track and everything like pretzels yeah man no no no no no no no no no  there you go mr woodcock i needed to cleanse the palate of the um all right well while you do that  here we go they talk about his last name this should be terrific so uh so do you like teaching over  there well honestly i'm just trying to save up enough money to retire while i still have a colon  well uh my last job was teaching middle school back in minneapolis so high school administration 
[03:20:00]  it's really a big leap for me i want to be like someone the kids feel like they can talk to like a  cool vice principal you know okay well it's just you know it's human nature for kids to hate their  vice principal and your last name is woodcock kids are going to have a little fun with that  oh boy i just like him because linda stacy hated him so much in this because he was dark 
[03:20:30]  fucking mullet cunt likes it light and airy and that fucking who's that motherfucker david bianca  whatever from the daily news oh i hope he gets fucking asshole cancer and sneezes and his  intestines fall out on the floor while his kid is getting married what did he do to you he fucking  trashed us late in the season i hope he fucking dies wow why did he do that why because he's i'm 
[03:21:00]  serious late in the season i'll tell you why okay because he just wanted to be hurt again  and he's a fucking cocksucker he's a fucking cocksucker let's get him on the phone no  i i won't be able to handle it all i'll do what makes for great radio okay if you want to get him  on i will hope i will not try to be diplomatic i'll try the first time good good get him on the radio  what did linda stacy review did she review this show i'd love to see her review oh the comedy is so 
[03:21:30]  refreshing no she didn't like it because she thought it was too dark she i think she didn't  like it this yeah we're listening to that's really jimmy said about a minute and a half ago  i thought he was talking about somebody else then he went with david and how much he hated him too  yeah i thought he was talking about the other one not linda stacy i'm just trying to get you back  because i heard me uh not listening the other day oh did you on the replay how how embarrassing is  that it is rough to listen to when you know it's coming all right here's more woodcock jokes 
[03:22:00]  hey my pool table catalog what's up baby nothing you know i was just thinking since  we probably won't be using the formal dining room that much that it may be fun to put a pool table  there or a wooden cock that's an interesting idea you realize woodcock you're never getting that pool  table what here we are no your wife said that's an interesting idea that's woman talk for maybe when  the sun burns out what do you got going on with those papers there you're very busy oh these are 
[03:22:30]  just some flyers telling the kids about a website i set up so they can email me with their questions  or concerns my woodcock.com you're not making it very easy on yourself are you when you see how many  hits my woodcock gets it does sound kind of bad playing around with the name but playing around  with it it doesn't quite work see how many hits my woodcock that's only a funny name if his wife's 
[03:23:00]  maiden name is splinter cunt yeah it's not it's not like blatant enough to be even funny like it they're  really working the woodcock angle but it should just be cox or something like his name is cox and  then they could say like hey cox.com what's coming up on there let's see woodcox woodcock um helps them 
[03:23:30]  out yeah see they're able to do woodcox out there no no cock they just get in trouble his name is cox  yeah but like what we're saying it doesn't even make their forced pun doesn't even make any sense  no because they say how many hits your woodcock would get like you wouldn't say how many hits  would your cock get right it just doesn't make any sense it doesn't make any sense but it's fun to cut  up oh and it's we have to do more i i want to have a few laughs so i'm depressed now come on it's got 
[03:24:00]  to get better marriage and fun one more clip why is this couple still together if they're  completely miserable you just and the guy knows all the things you want let me tell you what that  means because most married because most married couples are miserable so they're relating to their  viewers oh see this is going to relate to those and the younger yes but wow fantastic they have  realized that most people that are married are miserable great and don't know how to get out of it 
[03:24:30]  because society tells us that we really should stay married to the one we love the season finale  him killing her that'd be great what about this pool table thing you really don't know me and my wife  all that well okay she is going to be fine with it no she's not how could you possibly know that a pool  table is for fun men want to have fun and wives want to walk that fun deep into the woods and shoot it  dead marriage isn't about fun marriage is more about having someone to drive you to the hospital 
[03:25:00]  for your operations and you will start having your operations your cataracts your tumors here at  certain points in the marriage being a single guy might seem like more fun but there's nothing fun  about being a single guy with the tumor i just couldn't disagree more you think it'd be fun to be a  single guy with the tumor no just your incredibly dark take on things steph and i we met hang gliding  we scuba dive last summer we visited a working amish farm don't tell me about fun 
[03:25:30]  i am really angry at the end for bringing this into us no obviously something happened oh i know  the reason and and you succeeded trust me no something happens i am so annoyed it cut off where  before it was supposed to didn't it didn't that cut off like you got to re-burn that disc because 
[03:26:00]  that's not that's how i ended it that ended just like that really in real life that ended just like  jesus christ oh my dear sweet lord this is this we really should just move on this is what losses  because this can't possibly be that's always good to see you know because so many people like to bash  certain sitcoms it's always good to see what else is on you know what other gems are on with the big  that's gotta drive you nuts it may it makes me it makes you want to take a box cutter 
[03:26:30]  and fucking it's like somebody's throat see i'm mad for you jimmy because i you know i know you and  stuff but for i mean you're part of lucky i mean you're doing it and yeah and you know how funny  the show is and and you're wondering if you're going to be picked up for a second season and this  crap is on the air just mocking you know they may not get picked up either but you know when you look  at great shows and look i i know i was never a kramer fan on seinfeld but it is a great show  or fucking mash or you know you don't look at them in the same vibe as yourself because those are 
[03:27:00]  brilliant brilliant shows but when you look at something like this like this is technically a  first year or that juliet louise dreyfuss show the fuck her name is and she just won so now they're  bringing the second season of that dog shit back they are bringing that back probably because she won  the emmy that was horrid it was awful she might have been a good actress in it uh although she  couldn't have been better than fucking she couldn't have been better than lisa kudrow in the comeback  she could not have acted better than kudrow in the comeback yeah the acting is awful too 
[03:27:30]  it's the same character he played on raymond it's just that same no no he's not his acting is  uh-huh whatever it is mr woodcox uh and his he's like sing-songy right like through his lines as if  you can almost read along with him right right seth in uh brooklyn seth morning boys uh i think  mr woodcox was in the studio with you guys when he was playing uh charlie brown as a gay  yeah god is dog or dog is god oh that kid right yeah hey how about that yeah okay great digger 
[03:28:00]  well i liked him in that play i thought it was that 70s show kid yeah randy in new york randy yo  yo what's up guys hey i i watched the pilot of that back in the day a couple of weeks ago it's i mean  if you watch the show it's not great comedy but it's pretty funny if you actually see it you're  defending it by saying it's pretty funny yeah but that's what you get with sitcoms nowadays you  gotta expect it you know yeah but why why do we have to accept that look we gotta accept the 
[03:28:30]  mediocrity the only time they take a chance in network is cartoons they look at a cartoon they  could be edgy with a cartoon anything else real people they're not edgy and you gotta accept it  that's how tv is now he's right and then like network tv they're wondering why like youtube and all  these video sites are so popular we want to see crazy shit they only with the only time with  non-animated they try to come up with concept shows like the rest of development and stuff like that  to kind of not be edgy but still you know be unique they don't do well stuff like that it doesn't do 
[03:29:00]  well it's just cheesy so you get a couple of chuckles and then turn on oh and i i see you guys  thank you here's uh i just want to show you an example of uh real acting all right why not  how'd your parents die why not how'd your parents die why not how'd your parents die why not how'd  your parents die why not how'd your parents die why not how'd your parents die why not how'd your  parents die dude i've been craving that you know what it is i wanted all these sound clips plus the  original i think i only asked 30 times in the last week so why would it be sending me um why not 
[03:29:30]  you know what i mean you know how it is when you when you're asking well because erock is coming  into work late that's right everyone's busy an hour and a half in one week could have had  it's just gonna have it oh thank you danny danny danny emailed us because he's a good boy  thank you danny thank you about time shit dick hey you want to move on i want to hear more  even more woodcock jokes i want more more jokes about his name what what if steve had any opinions  on those jokes i mean maybe when the next one is told that's terrible i'm sorry yeah that kid's not 
[03:30:00]  allowed to have a scooter in the hallway that kid's allowed to do whatever he wants that's pete pratt  his dad is his big heart surgeon who operated on the principal and saved his life now a little  douchebag's untouchable there's the guy looking good how was your summer ah not too bad waste a few  cars kicked around europe so uh who's this new man you share your life with no i'm your new vice 
[03:30:30]  principal mr woodcock i'm sorry uh mr wood what  and so it begins  and they that all those laughs just roll in over the same fucking joke it's the same joke  no it's not but when real laughs come in they're too loud fucking people complain when people are so 
[03:31:00]  not used to hearing fucking real live audio class of course whole country should be fucking firebombed  bottom line people have always killed each other people are currently killing each other  and people will continue to kill each other forever all right have a great afternoon  so how was your big first day of school get any emails to my woodcock quite a few actually most of  them not so nice and i could have done without that hurtful one from you 
[03:31:30]  holy crap that's his acting stinks he's really bad but no he was saying that that brad brad garrett  yeah send him a hurtful one a hurtful um email to his woodcock how's your woodcock doing  how's that woodcock it's hurtful it's hurtful i like brad garrett too i think i like his character  the fact this character's kind of a douche in this i do appreciate that yeah yeah i mean  some of the sometimes the writing is beyond your control yeah i guess but i mean i do kind of like 
[03:32:00]  what he's doing as far as the characters being a cranky but what's the uh kid's name the neighbor's  name the family oh wait wait it's uh uh bark dick no no uh shit fuck it something like um  hey why don't we move on i'm having a few layers why don't we move on opie oh don't rob me  she'll say isn't the room a little small for a pool table and you'll say no and she'll say yeah but how 
[03:32:30]  often do you really get to play pool and you'll say well i don't get to play much but i'd love to  and then she'll say but isn't it more important to have a nice room for dinner parties and you'll  say well in reality sweetie we really don't host that many dinner parties and now you've pissed her  off because even if women don't actually host dinner parties they want to believe that they host dinner  parties that's why you just registered for thousands of dollars worth of china what pattern did you get 
[03:33:00]  butterflies  the reason why china rhymes with vagina  too bad she wasn't buying a bunt is that a pattern no bunt or a thing oh bunt okay 
[03:33:30]  too bad she wasn't buying alan funt that's why alan funt well you know what your wife's name is  lol give me those ribs you please don't rob me of the laughter can we move on i'm fighting horrible  depression what are we moving on to well what we could please clip about another woodcock joke  there's no way no way you're fucking lying no way they're doing another woodcock joke guys  put down the goldfish we are going jogging what no you said we could be fat that was our 40th

[03:34:30]  this is horrid  can we move on i hope the hollywood reporter  and whatever one of those magazines i just hope there's fucking anthrax in the vents  um you almost skipped one there hope you shouldn't um we shouldn't go find these people because i'm  might get them i get them on the show i don't know i let's get rolling in here i don't i don't know 
[03:35:00]  is rolling around tonight we're not allowed i don't think what uh but uh why don't we move on we  don't need to don't rob me of the land we don't need to hear what the actual pool table fight was  oh my god we have to i need closure i'm sad i need to close your give me the gift of laughter  actually sweetie i was thinking about that pool table and are you sure the dining room's big enough  wait a minute oh wow is that a prediction coming true that's just what he said would happen wow 
[03:35:30]  he knows he knows he knows he knows because he's been married a long time he's smarter than a  woodcock anthony with the language oh look at that look at the picture i was thinking about that pool  table and are you sure the dining room's big enough  i'm gonna predict the next line i got it there it is you pause that and he'll say 
[03:36:00]  if that's not big enough we can put the pool table in your pussy  or no no no i got it i got it it's okay because we don't play with pool  i play with my woodcock see that gets the woodcock joke in for the 18th time  solves the problem and then wait a minute we need we i don't get much time to play 
[03:36:30]  yeah i it is big enough because i'm not gonna play a pool on it i'm gonna rape women on it  that's a good one or he just says fuck you bitch and punches her in the face right and  fucking chalks up a stick and fucking assaults her asshole with it  whether it's big enough or not we're getting a pool table and if you don't like it you can take  your cunt out on the porch and then uh brad garrett walks in they discuss a little more and uh it seems 
[03:37:00]  that uh the kid there gets a little uh feisty with his wife there though no nothing's wrong  just stay in the living room i'll handle it  i understand too that the fact that she had a lot of money  really annoyed somebody well you know what it was i heard that mr woodcock's wife was raised 
[03:37:30]  improperly yeah and she was just she had so much money and he just got mad at her  yeah one day here's a clip from the show the best sitcom laugh clip ever all right  and he talks about the size uh of her pussy but he's nervous yeah it's out um friday wide  there's plenty of room in there honey yeah but how much you really play pool anyway i got the next 
[03:38:00]  line i don't i don't really i don't really play pool a lot but occasionally i like to finger a baby  listen listen how upset he gets like she won't let him get that pool table 
[03:38:30]  anyway i don't i don't really play all that much but that's mainly because i don't have a pool  table i gotta say i'm a little confused honey you said that you love the idea of a pool table you 
[03:39:00]  thought that the purple felt was pretty purple is fine if you're a pimp  i got the next line okay yeah oh it's okay if i were a pimp i'd make you go out and suck black  cock till i got that pool table  it's like we're listening to the actual sitcom  got a clip actually from the season finale when the neighbor comes over and asks uh hey  where's your wife hey where's your wife no she's dead
