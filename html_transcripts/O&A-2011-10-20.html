<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show began with a discussion about their upcoming time off,  the work schedules of other SiriusXM personalities like Howard Stern and Alex Bennett, and the hosts of "Matchup."  This segment was punctuated by a running gag about avoiding management regarding their vacation and a comedic tasting of Christmas cookies and a key lime pie brought in by Sam Roberts' mother. The cookies were universally deemed excessively dry, while the key lime pie received mixed reviews, with some finding it too sweet.  The excessive packaging on the baked goods also provided ample comedic fodder. Richard Bay was mentioned, and several SiriusXM personalities, including morning show hosts, briefly visited the studio. Profanity was heavily used throughout.  Jimmy Norton was mentioned but absent.

The show then transitioned to a discussion about a DJ's extreme sleep deprivation fueled by Adderall and coffee, despite a demanding work and gym schedule. This segued back into a discussion about dry cookies, leading to increasingly vulgar jokes and anecdotes involving a person named Jim.  A substantial portion focused on a listener's story about their manager, Jonathan, in the Ivory Coast amidst rebel activity.  His seemingly fearless approach to travel, including previous trips to North Korea, prompted speculation about his occupation and unusual ability to connect with people in diverse, often dangerous, situations.  Pictures of Jonathan, including one with armed men, were discussed and contrasted with a picture of Anthony with a rifle.  The “F.U. line” segment followed, featuring profane listener messages.  Upcoming guests Tom Papa, Von DiCarlo ("Patrice's Girl"), and a call-in from Robert Kelly in Aruba were announced, along with promotion of a Patrice O'Neal Audible recording benefiting his family.

Following this, the conversation lightened, touching upon a past Chaz Bono appearance, the hosts’ opinions on the death penalty, sports predictions, a listener's 49ers complaint, Kim Jong-il's supposed golfing skill, and a tale of stolen gold records from their former radio stations.  The show concluded with personal anecdotes about past relationships and a song ("Sometimes When We Touch") that evoked strong emotional responses.

A segment with Tom Papa followed, focusing on embarrassing first love and early sexual experiences. The conversation included self-inflicted injuries for attention, awkward kissing, training bra removal difficulties, and square dancing as an unexpected source of sexual tension.  Tom Papa discussed high school reunions and the challenges of finding privacy for sexual activity in their youth.  Bobby Kelly called in from Aruba, contributing to a rambling, comedic conversation.  Outlandish, fabricated stories about Kim Jong-il were interjected.

A call with Jonathan Branstein, Jim Norton's manager, took place, focusing on his dangerous travels in Africa, including an incident with locals angered by a photo. Jonathan described his experiences, and his adventurous, seemingly fearless travel style prompted speculation about his potential spy background. The segment then shifted to a conversation with Vaughn, Patrice O'Neal's wife. They discussed Patrice, his passing, and the release of his posthumous audio and CD ("Mr. P").  Vaughn shared anecdotes about Patrice, including his daughter's comedic talent, and addressed misconceptions about his health.  The hosts and Vaughn reminisced about Patrice's personality, work ethic, and relationships, particularly with Colin Quinn. The release of Patrice's Audible recordings and CD was further promoted.

The final segment featured a discussion about Patrice O'Neal's stroke, with Von DeCarlo as a guest. They shared anecdotes about O'Neal’s repetitive behavior and blunt personality, including a story involving Colin Quinn at a dinner party.  The conversation included promotion of Bob Kelly’s shows and Patrice O'Neal's posthumous releases. Von DeCarlo discussed his own album release, "Honest Righteousness," and his management of O'Neal's social media.  Humorous banter about Jonathan's African travels continued, culminating in final plugs and goodbyes.

[00:00:00]  Thank you so much for listening. 
[00:00:30]  Thank you. 
[00:01:00]  Thank you. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  And now, a show the likes of which America's never seen.  So appalling, so offensive, yet so entertaining.  It's not your normal show.  Beamed from satellites in space down to you every single day.  What planet are we living on?  It's the Opie and Anthony show with Opie.  We're experts and we already know this is going to be great radio, so shut the fuck up.  And Anthony...  I live in a big house, I make a lot of money and I fuck attractive girls and little Jimmy.  I don't even like an R-opening.  It sounds like a little... 
[00:04:00]  What?  He's the dang open, and he's the dang open.  He's the dang open.  He's the dang open.  He's the dang open.  He's the dang open.  He's the dang open.  He's the dang open.  He's the dang open.  Stop with that shit.  I know.  Here they are.  Why am I introducing these buffoons?  I'm William Shatner, goddammit.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on.  Why?  Why?  Why?  Good fucking morning.  Why?  Why?  Why?  Why?  Why?  You guys sure you want to take tomorrow off?  Because, you know, when Howard's not working, I think you guys should be live. 
[00:04:30]  Shut your trap.  I think you guys should be live when Howard's not working.  Shut your yip.  He's barely live at this point.  Enough already.  You really?  I think I'm going to have to talk to the guys because I don't know.  I think they should be here.  Oh, little Jimmy Norton.  I think I need to go down the hall and talk to those guys.  You sure?  There will be no discussion.  I don't think it's a good idea that they should take tomorrow off like this.  Oh, new discussion. 
[00:05:00]  Shut up.  His logic is, well, you know, it's good.  It's good to have you guys live when Howard's not live.  It's like that happens 90% of the year.  Exactly.  What the fuck is...  Howard works three days a week.  Don't worry about it.  We're live a lot of days when he's not.  Maybe we should start working weekends.  Yeah, that'd be good.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I'm going to go talk to him.  Shut the fuck up.  We're one of those shows that should be off this entire week.  You're lucky we came in two days.  Yes.  Everyone else is off.  So I'm calling it.  This is our last fucking show of the year. 
[00:05:30]  Everyone, if any, note is off.  Right.  And we are of note, my friends.  Who's working today, Sam Roberts?  Well, Alex Bennett is not, but he does have a fill-in, which is Richard Bay.  Richard Bay is here today?  He's still alive?  You didn't see him yesterday walking around?  No!  He must look a lot different than we remember him.  What was Richard Bay about?  I forget now.  Richard Bay had the Richard Bay show.  I know.  What was the Richard Bay show, though?  It was like one of those wacky shows.  He took over when Howard left the Channel 9 thing. 
[00:06:00]  Richard Bay show came in.  Yeah, he tried to be wacky.  That's 20 years ago.  I know.  What has he done in the last couple?  What have you done for me lately?  What the hell is a Richard Bay show?  He did it on RichardBay.org.  And he was one of the K-Rock fill-ins when they were just throwing shows in at night.  Oh, right, yeah.  And what the fuck did Alex Bennett do in this past year that he deserves off today?  That's a great question, actually.  Snide looks?  I couldn't find him on this fucking service if you paid me.  What channel is he on? 
[00:06:30]  I can't answer that immediately.  I'd have to do some research on that.  He's just a grumpy old man that stares at us, wants some kind of confrontation, but he's  not brave enough to start it.  Who, Alex Bennett?  Yes!  Sam Dusky.  Oh.  But he's off, right?  Who else is off?  I haven't seen the OutQ guys.  OutQ?  I haven't seen them yet.  They were here yesterday.  I don't know if they're here today.  Howard's obviously off.  The matchup's standing strong until Thursday.  All they do is play tunes.  That's easy.  I can do that in my fucking sleep. 
[00:07:00]  To be fair, they're not actually live until 7 o'clock anyway.  Give me that job.  The first hour is taped.  And it's the matchup.  Please.  It's not a show.  It's the matchup.  I said shows of note.  Here's your 20 songs.  Play them over and over again.  That's an easy job.  You should be a program director.  So, I mean, technically they're off, too.  Who else?  That guy from the sports show is on.  Steve Phillips?  Steve Phillips is on.  Kind of like the Steve Phillips.  He's aight.  Yeah, he's on.  At first, he was...  We say a lot of hellos in the bathroom.  We say a lot of hellos in the bathroom.  Yeah.  Does it go any further?  We're not really sure. 
[00:07:30]  There's a lot of hellos going on, though.  I don't know what that leads to.  It might lead to something.  Who else?  I mean, that's all I can...  Yeah.  Off the top of my head.  Are Gary's going to walk down the hall and talk to us?  No, you're not.  Well, I mean...  No, you're not.  There will be no chat.  And don't say live reads and blah, blah, blah.  This place did not do me one favor this year.  I don't do them a favor back.  It's just a conversation.  Last show of the year.  Let's enjoy ourselves.  Here's what I'll be hearing when he wants to talk.  Get out of the way, savage! 
[00:08:00]  That's what's going to be happening.  And here's what I'll say.  Dude, I'll talk to them.  And then I'll see them January 4th.  Enabler!  What?  That's just how I lie to you.  Enabler, yeah.  Get the fuck out of here.  There's no loyalty in this place.  It's every man for themselves.  Exactly.  So this is our last show.  And we're going to go step away and enjoy ourselves for a couple weeks. 
[00:08:30]  Loyalty, schmoyalty.  Exactly.  I'm putting a dress on and getting in the lifeboat.  I don't care.  All for one.  All for one.  Shut up.  He just thought he might have a conversation about...  He's not having a conversation.  Conversation?  This conversation is, happy holidays, and I'll see you in the new year.  Fuck that.  Merry Christmas.  That's what I say.  Anything else?  Merry Christmas.  We'll be denied.  Denied.  Denied.  That's what we do.  Live reads.  That's how we roll. 
[00:09:00]  Live reads.  Hey, you know what?  I'll fucking do whatever it takes.  Stack them up, yo.  We'll do tomorrow's live reads today.  You want them recorded?  Yeah, I don't care.  Find some time during the fucking, between now and ten, and I'm all in.  Yeah, I don't care.  I'll watch Anthony do live reads until he's fucking blue in the face.  I'll fucking rattle those things out in a second.  Me and Jimmy will just stare at them, man.  We have no problem with that.  I gotta run in and tape my Boneyard show like it's live.  Oh!  Everything's recorded in this day and age. 
[00:09:30]  Sure is.  We're quite Edward R. Murrow here, are we?  I think we did enough shows this year.  Let's all relax, Gary.  Yeah.  I would love to know how many.  Could someone, seriously, who's really good at math, I want to know how many shows we did  about and how many shows Howard did about.  I'd be curious to know that.  Everyone knows it's just a huge disparity there.  A massive disparity.  But then if you look at every other show and, you know, I think we're on par with that.  And we're the type of show that should, like, people don't expect us to be in. 
[00:10:00]  That's just it.  Right.  Like, when we were in yesterday, people were like, oh, shit, ONA are live today?  It's like, yeah, we're the type of show that should be off.  Yeah.  I give myself a little pat on the back every so often for the show, and we should be off.  By the way, not one phone call yet.  Know why?  Because everyone else is off.  The ride in today was weird.  It was like a ghost town heading through Times Square.  90 miles an hour on the entire stretch of the Grand Central up to the expressway,  and then from, like, it gets a little traffic-y, but from the Van Wick all the way back down 
[00:10:30]  into the city, 90 miles an hour.  That coffee better be for me, man.  Bring it over here.  I'm ready for magic coffee.  Thank you.  So it was a quick ride in?  Yeah.  Nice.  I miss intern Max.  He was good.  I think Matt.  What?  Is that his name?  I think so.  I think his name was Matt.  I forget so fast.  That intern's good, though, that guy.  Sal?  Oh, is that his name?  Yes.  I don't even remember the good ones. 
[00:11:00]  That's how badly I don't remember the bad ones.  You're obsessed with Matt because you brought him up.  What?  No, I just brought him up because I saw Sal come in.  I saw Sal come in and was like, he's a good intern.  And then when you think of that, you think of the absolute opposite end of the spectrum  and think of the shittiest ones we've had, and that's why that popped in my head.  This has to be the last show of the year because you can't bring in Christmas cookies the second  to last show of the year.  Well, there's not just Christmas cookies there.  Now, what's going on?  Because I'm seeing a Tupperware thingy. 
[00:11:30]  Well, hold on.  Hold on.  First of all, where did you buy this from?  Yeah.  Where'd this shit come from?  Look at it.  It has a bow.  It has Christmas balls.  The bow was hand-tied by my glutton-for-punishment mother.  And the balls of the Benoit variety.  Really?  I don't know why.  She just calls me.  Oh, I have some treats for the guys.  I'll be honest.  I got to step out of character.  I'm embarrassed.  You should be.  The shit we put her through. 
[00:12:00]  Yesterday.  It's not even like you put her through shit.  Yesterday you did it.  And then she called me and I had to awkwardly go to the house, both of us knowing what we  discussed.  By the way, yeah.  Yesterday's conversation with her was brutal.  And what does she do?  She turns around and makes this?  Yeah.  You could buy this in a store.  Look how nice that looks.  You haven't even seen what's in the Tupperware.  Oh, shit.  So, Anthony, what?  You don't like the nuts you're saying?  I hate fucking anything that's supposed to be cakey and sweet and tasty that has nuts 
[00:12:30]  thrown in.  It fucks everything up.  What kind of nuts, though?  Any type.  What about a good almonds?  How about a good almond?  I don't like almonds.  I don't like walnuts.  I don't like peanuts in anything.  Don't put fucking...  Sometimes...  You don't like peanuts and stuff?  You're not American.  Peanuts are a standalone nut.  Black man.  Let me just be honest with you.  Peanuts, a standalone nut.  You eat them alone.  I don't like them in other things.  What about in a cookie?  No!  He doesn't like integration of any kind. 
[00:13:00]  Right.  Food integration.  That horrible...  Is that a fucking mixture?  Is that a pecan?  Mongrel cookie.  Is that a pecan?  Yeah, well, the...  A pecan.  The platter includes traditional cookies.  I don't like pecans.  A pecan tart.  Pecan?  What'd you just say?  Pecan.  Why fucking nuts?  And why pecan?  It's a pecan tart.  She tasked me.  Your mother tasked me, and I shall have up for it.  Isn't it pecan?  There's fudge with no nuts.  Ah, fudge with no nuts. 
[00:13:30]  There's fudge with nuts.  Oh, okay.  Sorry.  Sorry.  Sorry.  What's something I would like?  Yeah, open that shit up.  Is there a white cookie?  Fuck the fudge.  There's cookies.  Why are we being so difficult?  Look at how beautiful that looks.  Grab those red balls.  Open it.  Could you make me one of those for my mom?  Look at the big ribbon.  I'd rather buy one of those from your mom than go to a store.  She should have a store.  Holy shit.  Did she, like, individually sprinkle that stuff on each cookie?  Yes. 
[00:14:00]  Oh, my God.  Oh, and she twisty wraps it?  Of course there's a twisty wrap.  Well, she wants to keep it all fresh.  You wouldn't believe the instructions that she gave me after I left the house with these.  What were they?  What were the instructions?  I was just sitting there for 15 minutes while she was telling me how to carry things and what  to refrigerate and for how long.  Oh, boy.  Seriously?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  She takes this shit very seriously.  You Roberts are all needy.  Yeah.  All want attention.  Okay.  Of course there's a layer of cellophane over the plaque.  Oh, wouldn't there be?  This is taking forever.  Holy shit. 
[00:14:30]  What the fuck is she packing up for?  I wouldn't be surprised if each cookie is individually wrapped.  I know.  Okay.  All right.  Now we're taking off the last layer.  Sure.  Why not?  How many layers have you taken off so far?  Three.  It's like using birth control and a condom.  Oh.  Wait.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  Wow.  He wraps his dick like his mom wraps pastries.  He's right.  So crazy.  Cellophane and then that plastic, like, that plastic wrapping.  Yeah.  Decorative wrapping.  And then what else?  Well, it was tied with a ribbon, but under the ribbon was a twisty tie. 
[00:15:00]  Right.  And then it was also tied with two little ornaments.  But then wasn't it in another bag just to get it over here?  Yeah.  And then it was carried in a bag.  And then it was carried in a bag.  And then it was tied with a tie under the ribbon because I didn't want it slipping off.  Sam, give them the cookies.  Do you smell that?  Yeah.  You smell that?  Cookies.  Love the smell of cookies in the morning.  Smells like fat.  All right.  Hold on.  Why don't you explain this shit?  I see the fudge.  Let's go again.  I'm putting the wire into the cookie.  What is that?  What is this?  That's a pecan tart.  Fuck that.  Just try it. 
[00:15:30]  Pecan tart?  Try the pecan tart.  No.  What is this?  That's what happens when the pecan's mother drinks.  Is that no nut fudge?  That's no nut fudge.  Why are you yelling at the cookies?  I hate that she put fucking nuts in everything and fucked my whole Christmas up.  What about the cookies?  What's the one Jimmy's eating?  That's a pecan tart.  No.  Isn't that different than those things over there?  No.  The ones over there.  I think those are rum.  Coconut balls?  Yeah.  Rum coconut balls.  Oh, shit.  Coconut balls.  She wants me to drink.  Yeah, she does.  She's trying to ruin me. 
[00:16:00]  She has my other.  Yeah, I think that's right.  Wait, you know what?  The rum in some of that cooking shit you can't even?  I'll trust it.  Okay, fair enough.  And what about the Christmas cookies themselves?  Those are just delicious.  That fudge is pretty goddamn good.  I gotta give you that.  Okay.  Goddamn, that's some good fudge.  I don't know if it's worth $5.  It's made from scratch, by the way.  She might pull out the cookie victory on the last show of the year.  That's the goal.  Oh, shit.  You want me to open this?  What's that?  What is it?  This is...  What kind of cookies? 
[00:16:30]  Just eat one.  Ow.  She not only wants to be the cookie champion, I think she's going for the entire title today.  Sam's mom.  Baking champion of the Opie and Anthony show.  That is a key lime pie.  I've never...  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  She was so...  You see those little lime slices on the...  That's a beautiful key lime pie.  She bought tiny limes.  Yeah.  And she wouldn't slice them until I got to the house.  Wow.  Like, she took the pie out and put the little tiny limes.  Yeah. 
[00:17:00]  Looks like a chintzy helping of limes, if you ask me.  It's not...  Let me tell you something about the cookies.  Yeah.  Very dry and a little bland.  What's wrong with you?  They're a little bland.  A little bland.  Like, I'll be honest with you.  There's no real, like, oh, that's a good cookie.  It's just like, all right, I'm chewing something crummy.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Oh, crummy.  Right?  It's crummy.  That's right.  In many ways.  Yes.  Yeah, Jimmy's complaining.  I think that's like...  I'll have two cookies.  I'm not dealing with the cookies.  I don't like them.  Well, you like the fudge, though?  The fudge was good.  Try the rum coconut balls.  No, I'm not trying coconut balls. 
[00:17:30]  Try it.  Sometimes I don't eat stuff just for the way they sound when you say their name.  You want to eat a rum coconut ball?  I want rum coconut balls.  What's with your mood today?  Oh.  Your mood sucks.  I got all fucking pissed off at Dummy Down the Hall that I didn't even hear yet.  Why?  With his dumb talk.  I'm not having a chit-chat with management today.  It ain't fucking happening.  The boss wants to talk a little bit.  Exactly.  Fuck that shit.  I think I got to talk to the guys.  No, you don't.  He's your boss.  No, you don't.  He's not our boss.  I go home. 
[00:18:00]  Now you piss me off.  He's your boss.  Sorry.  Nothing to do.  No training today.  No nothing.  I could just go home.  I could fucking do it.  And you think I'm going to taint that wonderful fucking Tuesday afternoon with a meeting with  management?  When the boss says you go?  With middle management?  Lower middle management?  You stay till the boss says you leave.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  That's good.  And I'm my own boss.  I am my own boss.  He's a Funderwomen.  A race car.  I am my own boss.  Let's cut that key lime pie.  What are we waiting for? 
[00:18:30]  Yeah, why'd you cut it, Sam?  Let's go.  Yeah, cut that.  We have a woman here.  Let's go.  All right.  Cut that key lime crepe.  So far.  How fucking thick is that?  Oh, look at Mars.  That's the thinnest fucking pie I've ever seen.  It really is.  It's a key lime flyer.  The key lime pancake.  Make sure you cut deep.  Oh, you're sliding the limes right through the whole thing.  Oh, his mother would have a heart attack right now.  Oh, mother would not be happy.  Jesus.  A Puerto Rican that can't work a knife.  I know.  You're worthless.  Pretend you're stealing its pocketbook.  Make sure you get that graham crush.  You're not cutting the crust, Mars. 
[00:19:00]  Oh, Mars.  Put a little arm into this.  Oh, my God.  Did you eat the cookies yesterday?  Yes.  Paul's mother's cookies.  Paul's mother's cookies were fucking store-bought.  Those weren't Christmas cookies.  Oh, store-bought.  I think they were store-bought.  They were, right?  But they were delicious.  They weren't Christmas cookies.  Were they store-bought?  Yeah.  Why aren't you guys paying attention?  What, Mars with the limes?  No, he's completely ruining the pie.  Sam's mom would have a heart attack.  Yeah, she might have a heart attack.  Oh, something.  Because Sam's mom's all about presentation.  Those t-ass limes are gone.  The limes are all buried now.  Yeah, they'll end up in there. 
[00:19:30]  They were individually sliced, you know, when Sam got to the house.  What is that, rolling paper with whipped cream on it?  Yeah, did she go to smalllimes.com?  You guys go all the way out here, yeah.  You're home of tiny limes.  What, does she make pies that you could slide under a door in case it's locked?  She's friends with a lot of AIDS patients, so she doesn't want to talk to face-to-face.  Oh, look at this sloppy slice.  Thanks, Mars.  Oh, yeah, Mars.  Hold on, please stop.  Will you stop taking my cake?  It's pie.  I'll have a piece of pie.  I'll have a piece of pie, please.  Make sure you get all that graham crust. 
[00:20:00]  My dad was ecstatic about how good this pie was.  Well, that looks like good pie.  Mmm.  Okay.  Good.  Is it good?  Yeah.  Not great, though, huh?  The slice into the...  It's really good.  There we go.  Okay.  What, am I supposed to eat this like a savage with my fucking fingers?  Have a fork.  How about a fork like a civilized man?  Where do the forks come from?  My mom.  She assumed we didn't have forks around this joint?  I insisted that we had forks and plates, but she insisted on packing the Santa plates. 
[00:20:30]  The Santa plates.  Key lime credit card.  It's thin.  Jesus.  You're just complaining today.  Ah, right?  Today's my last day eating bad.  Whenever it gets you through the thing.  I do.  I'm laughing.  I can't stop.  Limey.  Very good.  Limey.  And this, by the way, Opie, you better appreciate this, because you're the one who's been complaining  about key lime pie for months.  Not since Paul's mom brought it in.  I've been cool. 
[00:21:00]  I haven't had much crust.  There's not a lot of crust here.  Well, that's because Mars didn't slice it very well.  Can you help me cut this crust, please?  What is this?  What is this?  I don't know.  The presentation blows.  Can I have a fork?  No, no.  In all fairness, Mars fucked up the presentation.  Jesus Christ, Mars.  He just smeared the knife through this whole thing.  Now it's pudding.  Come here.  Now it's key lime pudding.  You cut it with a chainsaw.  Exactly.  And the pie, the crust is homemade, unlike some of the other pies that you've tasted? 
[00:21:30]  Very good.  The cartels do a better job of cutting than fucking Mars.  Yeah.  Get Al-Qaeda to cut it next time.  Ha, ha, ha.  I think I'm the same thing.  God damn, is that good?  Same as a cartel joke.  I know.  No, I hate it.  These are good.  God damn, is that good.  No, I don't need a pie.  That is good.  It's so lime tasting.  You don't like pie?  No, I don't need any pie.  What an asshole.  What?  What's wrong with you?  He's pissed at me.  It's like a drug dealer bringing some coke and he won't do it. 
[00:22:00]  Yeah, don't get high on your own pie.  Yeah.  Ooh.  That's good shit.  That's some good goddamn key lime pie.  I'll give you that.  I'll be honest.  The cookies suck a dick.  They don't have too much nuts in the shit.  The fudge is good, but the fudge is good.  You should try one of the-  Overall, I give it a C+.  You should try one of the dry almond trees.  No.  It's great.  It's like sand with almonds in it.  You want an almond sand treat?  Which one?  I don't know.  Whatever that is.  I'm not feeling the presentation. 
[00:22:30]  Of what?  The pie was great.  It tastes fucking amazing.  Well, that was the marquee piece.  I don't care about marquee piece.  You backed it up with this.  Your opening act sucked.  No, it didn't.  You enjoyed it.  No, I enjoyed one piece of fudge.  Your sand cookies are terrible.  They're not terrible.  I just had one.  It was delicious.  No, it wasn't.  You have the rotten taste of Gary in your mouth.  That's the problem.  That couldn't be true.  It's very bitter.  It taints everything that's going in.  I'm at one more piece of pie.  The holidays come but once a year.  That's true.  Oh, my God.  And you've been a good boy all year. 
[00:23:00]  All right.  Give me one more.  One more.  One more slice for hand.  Holy shit.  Holy shit, is that good?  I did kettlebells yesterday.  Kettlebell workout.  So I'm ready to just get all fat.  I slept.  Oh, Jimmy.  Because of my knee, I did nothing.  I got a massage and slept.  I got some pretty nasty joint pain in my right elbow.  I thought you were going to say political views.  In my right elbow.  But you know what?  You got to work through that shit.  Take the pain.  Yeah.  Take the pain.  Not really.  Not if it's joints. 
[00:23:30]  Why?  Be careful, bro.  What?  You got to take the pain.  When you get a little older, you got to worry about the joints.  You might be lifting too much.  No, no.  Take the pain.  Not with joints.  Lifting too much.  Muscles, yes.  Not joints.  It was a pint of Guinness.  Mars joints, you got to.  Yeah.  See, Mars knows.  I don't know if it's.  Be careful with the joints.  You don't want to deal with that shit.  I twisted my knee.  Someone knocked fudge on the floor.  Look at Mars knock his own fudge on the floor.  All right.  Every year, we don't have to make believe Mars is in shape anymore.  He's not.  He was.  Yeah, let's officially turn the page on that. 
[00:24:00]  Many years ago, he was.  He'd be like a fighter in 1910.  Yeah.  With that barrel chest.  We gave you a few years there.  Gentleman Jim Corbett.  Yes, exactly.  I haven't worked out for two and a half weeks because I hurt my knee.  Two and a half years?  Yeah, I thought you were going to say years.  It's probably about two and a half years.  The titties.  You're a retired fighter now.  We'll give you that title, but we're not going to make believe you're in shape anymore.  Oh, man.  We just can't do that.  It's not fair.  I'm in the best fighting shape of my life.  Oh, you must have sucked before.  Oh, shit.  I hate Sam.  I hate that guy. 
[00:24:30]  Oh, shit.  Have a piece of pie, Mars.  I did.  Thank you very much.  I bet you couldn't fight your way out of the paper bag, as they say.  Delish.  The paper bag would win.  You got to go delish.  Delish.  All right.  So we got our treats.  Sam's mom, thank you very much.  Thank you.  I don't have anything bad to say.  Ant did.  That was very nice.  You didn't have a fucking dry ass cookie.  The cookies are good.  You put those cookies in fucking...  Put them in the pockets of new clothing to keep them from mildewing. 
[00:25:00]  Those are good cookies.  You like the cookies?  They're terrible.  They're all dry.  You ungrateful.  You say it with a mouthful of pie.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, that is pretty bad.  I want some of that fudge.  Don't eat all the fudge.  Please, have some fudge.  Have a cookie, too.  Have a rum ball.  Yeah.  Bring a cookie just to...  I don't know.  Did you have a coconut rum ball?  I don't have to touch the rum.  Try one.  Oh, that's right.  I'm sure they're dry.  They're not dry.  Marcelino, have a coconut rum ball.  Yeah.  These cookies would be great if they were white wine. 
[00:25:30]  Get it?  They're dry.  They're not dry.  I love looking at Mars' self-control.  You didn't even hesitate.  You didn't even hesitate.  You didn't even hesitate.  Look, there's a cactus growing out of one of the cookies.  They're not that dry.  They're not dry at all.  They grow in sand.  Wow.  I'm going to make religious figures in these cookies in Maryland.  I have a poem, Footprints in the Cookies.  Why, during the hardest times of my life, were there only one set of footprints in the cookies? 
[00:26:00]  In Greece, it was Danny and this cookie.  Oh, cookie, baby.  Sandy.  Well, exactly.  Yeah.  No, there's a...  I bet the cookies would be a giant hit in the office today.  Yeah, if we had a spill.  It's not going to be a giant hit.  You don't have Roland today, man.  That's true.  That's going to keep down the numbers.  That's true.  It's going to knock down your numbers. 
[00:26:30]  But radio people, they love them some free food.  Roland had to make believe he was sick to get out of here today, huh?  Is that right?  Yeah.  Can I crunch him up and make an ant farm?  No, that wouldn't work.  No?  The ants would just enjoy it too much.  No, I don't think they would.  They'd lay their pupa in there.  The cookies were dry.  So dry.  They weren't that dry.  They weren't dry.  That's terrible.  They were delicious Christmas cookies.  No, they're dry-ass cookies.  From scratch.  Yes, scratch-a-right. 
[00:27:00]  It scratched a cinder block and whatever fell off of it she made the cookies with.  It's terrible.  She used cookie dough.  Concrete cookies.  We're having a delicious moist chocolate chip cookie.  I know, right?  It's Christmas.  Why wouldn't moist cookies be better than dry cookies?  99% of people out there would like a moist cookie in lieu of a dry cookie.  What does she say when people come over?  Have a Christmas cardboard?  She tried a different recipe that was softer but prefers a crispier cookie.  Well, then she's insane. 
[00:27:30]  She's not insane.  Because I like a moist cookie, as does everybody.  Let's see how long you can go without drinking fluid now.  Yeah, quick.  Drink something fast.  It'll just absorb it up.  That's good.  That's a good cookie.  That's great.  That cookie should be fucking put on a garage floor.  Sop up the oil.  I was explaining everything.  They were throwing these cookies in the ocean after that oil spill. 
[00:28:00]  It's terrible.  They're really good.  Oh, did you have a cookie?  You've got to have a Christmas cookie.  Not yet.  Have one.  Just tell us what you think.  Just drop it into your coffee and just watch the coffee suck into it.  They're really good.  Yeah, don't dunk the cookie.  You won't regret it, Opie.  No, after the key lime pie, all I want to do is make fists.  There's so much sugar in me.  I know, right?  Have a cookie.  Have one cookie.  Have a cookie.  Just tell me what you think.  And a coconut rum ball.  Oh, God. 
[00:28:30]  Try the rum ball.  See, the coconut rum ball is probably the moist thing in the hole.  They're running them?  And then I'm sure the fudge looks moist.  A lot.  I'm sorry?  I have one.  Did you get all hammered?  If you like that kind of stuff, yeah.  I don't like sweets and liquor.  A lot of rum.  You're all fucked up?  I don't like that either.  I don't like sweets and liquor.  I got zooted from one of those once.  Did you get zooted?  Yeah.  I was drinking after that.  Yeah?  I mean, driving.  What?  What would you say would be the mindset of the actual limes in the pie chip? 
[00:29:00]  The mindset?  How are they feeling?  How are the limes feeling?  Probably like limeys.  Yeah.  You're trying to set them up for his bad job.  I know.  He just doesn't get it.  The color of the lime.  Yeah, yeah.  It's green.  Are the limes feeling a certain way?  I don't know, but those cookies are green with envy.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  I can't do anything.  He's just not a go-with-the-flow guy.  No, you can't set them up for anything. 
[00:29:30]  Yeah, those limes are probably feeling all, like, sour.  A bunch of sourpusses or something.  Oh, what about the cookies?  Key lime pie.  What do you open it?  The lime door or something?  Ah, that is a good one.  That's a good one, though, Key.  What about the dry cookies?  They were good.  I love those cookies.  He just doesn't.  He just doesn't.  He set them up and he just leaves them set up.  They were moist and delicious.  My mother would make cookies that were dry.  She'd put them on a table.  They would just crumble and fall apart.  And her friends would call her a white bitch. 
[00:30:00]  Chip, I have a cookie.  Everybody try pecan tarts?  I had one.  No.  Why don't you go with pecan?  Pecan.  It was like eating a fucking, it was like eating the Sphinx.  Yeah.  That's my, that's my only problem with the whole thing.  What?  Pecan.  People make pecan pie all the time.  Yeah, I don't like it.  I never eat it.  There's two different things.  Next time she should ask what we want.  She made you a key lime pie.  Oh, yeah, she did.  I didn't notice any, I didn't notice any apple things. 
[00:30:30]  I love apples.  We do love apples.  Fuck the pecans.  Fuck the almonds.  Fuck the other, the rummy balls.  Fucking up rum balls?  Yeah.  The rum balls are good.  I just have a problem with the pecans.  That's too fancy for us.  She made you apple pie last time.  She made key lime pie.  I don't remember the apple pie.  This is the first key lime pie.  I don't remember apple pie.  I brought in an apple pie before.  All right.  What about blueberry pie?  Enough with the nuts.  Tell your mother enough with the fucking nuts.  She's obsessed with nuts. 
[00:31:00]  Look, I gotta tell you, Anthony, I'm not a fan of nuts either.  But some people are.  But some people, she made like 90% nuts in that fucking, on that bowl.  Yeah, the fudge has the nuts.  The pecan has the nuts, obviously.  There's the dry-ass cookies.  There's some no nuts.  There's nuts in the rum balls.  There's no nuts in the cookies.  Did you try them?  There's not.  There's sand in the cookies.  Yeah.  It's terrible.  No room for nuts.  Grapes of wrath cookies.  Yeah.  I'm not a fan of the traditional Christmas cookies.  They look all nice, like Christmas trees and stuff, but I'm not a fan.  You didn't even try them.  Exactly.  That's why. 
[00:31:30]  Because I'm not a fan.  That's very closed-minded.  What's the star on top of that cookie?  What is that made of?  Red Hot.  What's a Red Hot?  You know, like a little Red Hot candy.  Oh, candies in there?  No, it's not stupid.  Those Red Hot things?  Yeah.  Why would you put Red Hots in your Christmas cookies?  What's on the other ones?  Hot?  No.  Any chuckles?  No.  There's just a Red Hot.  Licorice chuckle?  Yeah.  How about some?  Does the bitch put razzles in the cake?  Is there crumbled up candy cigarettes?  No.  Is that her?  1950s candy?  Is that her twist on the cookie?  You make the Christmas tree cookie, and then you use sprinkles as if it were ornaments, 
[00:32:00]  and then the top is a Red Hot.  How about moisture?  Pop Rock's fill.  Yeah.  That's a moisture.  Exactly.  You're supposed to pour water on the cookies when you got them home.  Where'd you store them?  Under the bed?  That's great.  It's like a sponge that's been sitting under the sink for a month.  That's where he got the dress.  He was supposed to put them in the fridge, and he put them under the sink sideways.  You only had one cookie.  I had a few.  Yeah.  That's all I could take.  My insides are drying out.  I feel like a mummy.  Try another one.  You might be mistaken. 
[00:32:30]  Eating those cookies, you feel like you just took off your mask in space.  God, those are awful cookies.  Well, Mars has tried everything.  What's your favorite, Mars?  I haven't tried a cookie.  Try a cookie.  Try a cookie, and give us your honest impression.  Thank you.  The Red Hot, though, ruins it, right?  It doesn't ruin it.  Yeah, it ruins it.  A Red Hot.  It doesn't work.  It's a little bonus.  Bonus?  Bonus.  How about fucking a little bit of goddamn milk in the mix or something?  There's milk in there. 
[00:33:00]  No, there isn't.  Dried milk.  Powdered milk.  You gotta try one cookie.  Try a cookie, Mars.  Don't insult my mother.  How does she make cookies without any fucking liquid?  She uses liquid.  I don't think she did.  That's a dry-ass cookie, right?  Not to jump on the bandwagon.  Okay, he's jumping.  Now he's jumping.  No, he's not.  This is dry as hell.  Look at him talk.  He can't even talk.  There's no liquid in his mouth.  He's jumping on the...  Everybody has a key lime pie.  Mars is a standalone.  He threw it away the way he wanted to begin with. 
[00:33:30]  It was too dry.  Yeah, it was way too dry.  Have a rumble.  No, I had one.  What do you like over there?  The rumbles.  Mars is not feeling these treats.  Rumbles look like little doodies.  The key lime pie was the best.  That was correct.  Yeah.  You can't lose it with the key lime pie.  And I'll even give it the fudge.  The fudge was good.  With no nuts.  The no nut fudge.  Which I think there's two of them.  I think she took a risk by making Christmas cookies.  She should have made traditional peanut butter cookies or chocolate chip cookies.  We should do one of those cooking shows where we judge and go, you know, she took some risks. 
[00:34:00]  I like seeing that.  Yes.  But inevitably she failed at it.  The cookies, much too dry.  The selection is very one-sided.  If you don't like nuts, you're cut out of this whole mix.  True.  Now, the key lime pie was delicious.  I didn't really appreciate the presentation.  Well, Mars is fucked up the presentation.  No, it was too thin.  No, that's the pie.  A little too sweet, the pie.  Look, I'm judging this.  Don't talk back.  A little too sweet.  I'm afraid.  See, the longer this goes, by the end of this, this is going to fucking be bad for your mom. 
[00:34:30]  We're sending your mom home.  So maybe she should have made just a fudge variety pack.  And moister cookies and not as many nuts, which she would go crazy with the nuts.  Yeah.  People like nuts.  Fuck the nuts.  She gave us the shitty cookies that no one liked.  She probably gave the good cookies to her friends.  Yeah.  Yeah, this was the shitty cookie.  Yeah.  It's Christmas cookies.  They're not that good.  Let's get the morning mashup in here.  They'll be nice to the girls.  Let them.  Of course they will.  Fine.  Bring them in.  Tell them I made the cookies.  I'm sure they're not doing anything.  Tell them I made the cookies and everybody thinks they're...  Don't tell them it was Sam's mother. 
[00:35:00]  Well, to be fair, they're...  Yeah, I don't think they're here yet.  Why aren't they here?  They don't go live till 7.  They pretend they're live at 6.  They pretend they're live at 6?  How do we get that?  Well, they...  That's cool.  We want that in the new year.  How do we pretend to be on at 6?  They do three hours, and then the last hour that's live, they re-air the next day at 6.  And they only do three hours?  They do three.  Holy mother of fuck.  What the fuck are we doing?  And it's not like three hours.  It's like three hours of playing the hits.  I just was a fraction of an inch from saying, and literally saying it out loud, we are 
[00:35:30]  the N-words of Sirius.  Like I was ready to say it.  Oh, boy.  Three hours?  But we are.  And they don't even have to be here until 7?  Not until 7.  And then you got another guy that takes off most of the year?  You're talking about Howard.  And gets a part-time job worth, what is it?  10 million a year?  15 million a year?  I thought that was Iraq.  20 million a year for a part-time job?  Part-time job.  That's funny.  Just something to get me by.  He has two part-time jobs. 
[00:36:00]  What do we got here?  Oh.  Oh, here they come.  Look at this.  Now sell your goods to these people.  Sell your goods.  I want to know what you...  Sam's mom.  Hey.  I hate the cookies.  They're shit, and they're too dry.  Why would you say that?  They're shitty dry cookies, and everything else that's nuts in it.  Wait, we went through this last year.  Why are you hating on his mom's cookies?  I love the key lime pie.  What the fuck?  Because they're too fucking dry.  It's like sand.  It's his mother for crying out loud.  Do you know how much she put in hours of slaving to get this together for you? 
[00:36:30]  Oh, he said slaving.  You shit on it first thing I'm on.  Shut up.  Shut up.  She should make them better next time.  All right.  All right.  There's too much nuts on everything.  Wait, wait, wait.  No.  That's a pecan pie.  Watch the saliva leave his body.  Oh, my God.  He's talking about his mother.  That's a dry motherfucker, right?  Your hand is over it.  Why are you going to pecan?  This is good.  I see with the dryness, but it's good.  I see with the dryness, but it's good.  Try something else.  What is this cake thing?  Key lime pie. 
[00:37:00]  We have no problems with that.  It's the finest key lime pie in the nation.  Try one of the cookies.  It is good.  The key lime pie.  You try one of the cookies.  Yeah, try one of the cookies.  Oh, good.  Now you got it.  You just picked a boring cookie.  It's so dry.  A traditional Christmas cookie.  They're so fucking dry.  Looks like a snowflake.  It's a good cookie, right?  Delicious to me.  Wow.  And I bet you guys are really excited that you invited the angry black man in.  Yeah.  Try a cookie, Stan.  Just tell us what you think of the Christmas cookie.  You can have some fudge.  You can have fudge, too.  I don't like these in general.  Come on.  Just take one bite.  It's so dry. 
[00:37:30]  What's your cookie?  You eat that cookie.  But I do like this.  There's a coconut rum ball.  That'll get you fucked up.  There's a lot of rum in those.  The mom made all of this.  Oh, yeah.  She's a glutton for punishment.  Wow.  She just hates herself.  I don't know why she does this.  Is she on the phone?  Is she hurt?  No.  We did two hours with her yesterday.  Who would tell her?  Horrible hours yesterday.  She's a good lady, but she made some sandy cookies.  Look, she's drying up like the girl in Invasion of the Body Snatchers.  I like it.  What the fuck did you make?  These cookies look like they just tasted the Ark of the Covenant.  I couldn't get it.  I couldn't get it. 
[00:38:00]  There you go.  All right, guys.  We've got to go.  Great show.  Look at the cookies.  I think they're delicious.  Thank you, Nicole.  Really?  Nicole.  Thank you, Sam.  You're just being nice.  Even Stan, who's being nice, had to say the cookies were dry.  No, he didn't say the cookies.  He didn't even try the cookies.  He said pecan tarts.  I see the dryness.  You know what's going to happen now?  Nicole's going to get with her boyfriend, and she's not going to be able to get wet for like  a month because she's making all those cookies.  It's going to soak up all vaginal juices.  Black people are more motherly oriented.  A black guy will be nicer if he knows your mother made the cookies.  They're very respectful of like that shit.  Because they've got to give mothers and stuff. 
[00:38:30]  They've got to give double the love.  What happened now?  I want one more.  Is your vagina?  What happened?  Sop up in the rug?  Somebody knocked over something.  She just took an extra cookie, by the way, for the road.  Yeah.  Yeah, for the road.  To put it on the road in a pothole.  The toilet seat cover.  She's actually using that in case she hydroplanes to throw that in the street.  Help her car get out of the snow.  They would be good.  Can I get a load of those cookies for my trunk?  Just in case.  Ice storm.  You start skidding around.  You see, Sam's mom is just throwing cookies out on the front stoop so the mailman doesn't slip. 
[00:39:00]  And the birds don't even fuck with it.  They crumble these up on the highway and spit out the back of the truck.  Have some fudge.  What?  Have some fudge.  I had some fudge.  The fudge is very good.  The fudge was good.  Have a rock salt cookie.  These cookies should be piled up on the west side highway.  It's just horrible.  What about the key lime pie?  What did you think?  I'm sorry, but good.  It was very sweet.  A little too sweet.  It's pie.  Yeah, but it's sweet as a motherfucker.  A little too sweet.  I like the key lime pie.  I can't lie.  It's the finest key lime pie in the nation.  It's the second best key lime pie treat I've had. 
[00:39:30]  Oh, boy.  In studio?  The first best pie.  Yeah.  Your mom's losing her...  I have to say Paul's mom.  Yeah, Paul's mom.  That's because Paul's mom got it from Stop and Chop.  So it's...  I don't think so.  She made that.  Stop and Chop.  They suck.  Whatever.  Remember the crust?  The crust isn't the sweet part.  I'll say your mother's crust is better.  Much better.  Better crust.  Yeah.  I like the key lime.  I did, too.  There's minuscule limes.  Let me tell you something.  I don't even know where the limes are because Mars shoved them into the middle of the thing.  They're all green with envy sitting in the middle.  Oh, jeez.  The limes are. 
[00:40:00]  Wow.  There it goes.  The first batch she brought in, or you brought in for her, was amazing.  The apple pie, all that.  Fantastic.  Yeah.  This, I'm not feeling it.  She's one for one.  One for two.  Much more than...  Sorry, I can't add.  She's brought in more than twice.  She took the risk with the Christmas cookies.  Oh, I remember.  And people say, yelling at us, that Christmas cookies are supposed to be dry.  Why?  You're supposed to dunk them and shit.  You're supposed to have them with milk.  No, you're not.  Not this dry.  We know...  I've eaten Christmas cookies for 43 years.  Trust me. 
[00:40:30]  They're dry.  I know how to eat cookies.  I think we made the point that they're dry.  Exactly.  You notice every Christmas that Santa fucking leaves them up there without a bite mark in  them?  I'm starting to think that you guys are hypercritical.  No, we're not.  We just like a cookie.  You're starting to think that?  What a moist cookie.  What the fuck?  I want to sand my deck with that cookie.  The cookies are delicious.  And this recipe is better than the new recipe that was softer.  That wasn't a good recipe for Christmas cookies.  I'm sure it was. 
[00:41:00]  What are you talking about?  Soft, moist cookies.  Oh, what a madman.  It's Christmas cookies.  Didn't Daniel's son strap these to his hands to help Mr. Meoxy?  Mr. Meoxy.  Sand the floor.  Show me sand the floor with lousy cookies.  Show me bake to send.  That's fantastic.  All right.  Do you guys like the key lime pie?  You asked us ten times.  He's trying to end on an up note.  It was good.  He's smart, though.  For something too sweet, it was good.  It was too sweet. 
[00:41:30]  What about the fudge?  Jim, did you have a piece of fudge?  I had two.  I'm not a huge fudge guy, though.  I did like it, but fudge is always too sweet for me, so I can't judge.  Oh, so you know, you can't judge sweetness.  You say the key lime pie is too sweet, but you say all fudge is too sweet.  Jimmy, can you break down everything you had?  I had a few cookies.  No, how many?  How could they be that dry if you kept eating them?  Because I just...  You had two fudges.  I had a Duncan and a Koufax. 
[00:42:00]  Yeah, I had a Sandy Duncan.  No, Jesus.  And I had two pieces of key lime pie.  Two pieces.  Two pieces of fudge, like four cookies.  And two of the fucking dry...  Two of those fucking...  Two of those fucking...  What are those things?  Those walnut bandages that they are?  They're not walnuts.  So you kind of liked those...  No, I'm just a bit of a...  I've been on a food binge lately.  I've been very bad.  I've been fighting, going terrible. 
[00:42:30]  Because of my bad knee, I haven't really been in the gym.  Oh, Jimmy.  You just said it sucked, but you ate half the plate.  I didn't say that I'm not an obsessive addict, of course.  I drank Meisterbrow to get drunk.  It didn't mean it was fucking...  It wasn't good.  Paul Masson wine.  It is the master brew.  Some of that cheap beer is alright, though, man.  Eight bucks a case back there.  When you're fucking 16.  And have a coconut rum ball.  Try one.  I can't eat anything named a rum ball.  It just reminds me of Tippy Tom's sack.  Makes you feel sad that he's gone.  Yeah, that he's gone.  His balls are there on the plate. 
[00:43:00]  I give them to the kids.  I'm like, have a rum ball.  And then they fall asleep.  Come here, Jelly.  Come here, Jelly.  Jelly.  My ex got so mad at me because I was talking about Jelly, and she thinks it's cute that  he likes Christmas cookies.  Who's Jelly?  He's the three-year-old.  Yeah, that gets abused.  Yeah.  And we were having a nice chat about how cute he was and how he likes to read the night  before Christmas.  And then he said that one of the customers, he asked him to read the night before Christmas,  and the customer punched him in the face. 
[00:43:30]  You know, the customer because he's being sold for prostitution.  Yes, of course.  The customer punched him in the face.  Oh.  And she gets all mad because it's cute.  Poor Jelly.  Very upset that Jelly gets punched, yeah.  Slapped.  Did Troy Kwan try any of the cookies?  Yeah, let's get Troy in here.  Yeah, he loves a treat.  He's still working.  How about E-Rock?  E-Rock doesn't like sweets.  How are you?  That's impossible.  Give him a cookie.  How dare you?  That's sweet.  Yeah, does he like dries?  How does he get so overweight if he doesn't like sweets? 
[00:44:00]  Try sandwiches.  Sandwiches.  That's Sam's mom's cookies.  Don't give in to their negativity, Troy.  And the ones in the middle are the driest fucking cookies you'll ever eat.  They're Christmas cookies.  Everything else, if you like nuts, if you don't like nuts, you're fucked.  E-Rock, try a Christmas cookie.  Tell us what you think.  They're so dry.  They're good.  And they're Christmas cookies.  Isn't that just dry and tasteless?  Yeah, they are dry.  I think these are supposed to be a little bit more dry.  Why is something supposed to suck?  They don't suck.  They suck. 
[00:44:30]  They're tasty.  It makes you appreciate the moist chocolate chip ones a little bit more.  What's that?  Oh, is that her plan?  It's a cookie to make you appreciate good cookies.  It's a setup cookie.  Yeah, it's a setup cookie.  It's the opening act cookie.  Yes.  It's funny.  It's to cleanse the palate.  It's an open-by cookie.  Eric's going to try a coconut rum ball.  Oh, look out.  He's going to get hammered.  Oh, he's getting all fucked up.  He's dressed like one.  What do you think?  Oh, boy.  He made a face.  There's a lot of rum in this.  A lot of rum, right? 
[00:45:00]  It's delicious, but there's a lot of rum in this.  A lot of rum?  That's the problem.  She probably got loaded drinking rum.  She's an alcoholic.  How does she put the rum in there?  Let me put some nuts in it.  I don't know.  I didn't watch her make them.  What are you thinking of cookies, Troy?  It's okay.  It's good.  Sugar cookies aren't my favorite anyway.  Try one of these.  You have fudge, too, but try one of those pecan socks.  Tell me what you think of pecan socks.  Again.  It's good.  Yeah.  I mean, we're the chocolate chips.  You do chocolate chips. 
[00:45:30]  It's Christmas.  Yeah, but chocolate chips are great for Christmas.  She went traditional Christmas cookies, and please don't say that way.  Please don't.  You don't do chocolate chips on Christmas.  What's that?  Oh, Jesus Christ.  You should.  I forgot about it.  I prefer moist chocolate chips.  What's that?  Why are you doing this?  You don't want one of those?  Did you try?  How fucking dry is that?  It's pretty dry.  Yeah.  Yeah, but you have a glass of milk with it.  It's like pecans layered in underpants, though.  It's not terrible.  It looks like Tipping Tom's underwear when it was dry and hardened.  Oh, shit. 
[00:46:00]  That's great.  If you want chocolate chips, go get Chips Ahoy.  What's that?  Oh.  Those are great.  I like those.  That's good.  What part of the recipe says, go to dryer, get lint?  Yeah, you want to throw one of these into the fucking dryer to keep snack clean from happening?  Have some fudge.  Have some fudge.  Don't go wrong with fudge.  No.  Especially from scratch.  I want to add dryer sheet cookies.  Yes.  Oh, my God. 
[00:46:30]  They're terrible.  Try to have some fudge.  The cookies are almost gone, though.  Exactly.  That's how terrible they are.  Exactly.  Because everybody's trying to eat them to see, because they can't believe how dry they are.  I want to put these under my arms to stop perspiration.  Hey, give me an arid cookie.  He's a right-guard cookie.  Troy's upset that there's no chocolate chips in the fudge.  There should be.  The fudge is great, though.  Yeah, you've got to admit that, right?  The fudge is really good.  Yeah, the no-nut fudge.  Try some key lime pie that's too sweet.  Everything else has nuts in the fucking thing. 
[00:47:00]  It's not too sweet.  It's the finest key lime pie in the nation.  No, it's good, but it's...  There's a lot of nuts.  The key lime's really good.  It's too sweet, though.  Yeah.  I will say.  It's not too sweet.  You like the fudge, Troy?  The fudge is good.  Have you slept yet?  Last time I talked to you, you haven't slept?  What?  Oh, that's right.  How many hours are you up to?  Since yesterday.  I got up yesterday at 4.30.  Why did you sleep when you went home for a while before you DJ?  I mean, I sleep for like...  I nap for like an hour, but it's not real sleep.  What time did you DJ?  I start at 8 o'clock.  To what time?  Till 2.30.  Where?  Down in the West Village. 
[00:47:30]  You got Adderall going in the system?  A little bit.  I mean, not much.  I mean, I'm not tweaking or anything, but just a lot of coffee.  And then what do you do after work?  You don't go home and sleep like...  2.30, what time do you get home?  By 4?  Yeah.  And then I'll probably hit the gym for about an hour.  Jesus.  Oh, you hit the gym in the morning?  No, I hit the gym at night.  Like when I get home, that's when I work out.  I couldn't imagine.  Why would you get just tired?  You know what?  It actually kind of pumps me up.  Like I'll do like 30 minutes of cardio.  Because then you wake up after an hour of sleep and you're just exhausted?  No, I don't really get exhausted.  I actually feel more awake when I do that. 
[00:48:00]  No, no, no.  I mean like if you slept for an hour.  You're still going to die young.  Yeah, it's not healthy.  It's not healthy.  But have a piece of key lime pie before you pass away.  You can't do that to your body.  How old are you?  34.  Yeah, he's all right for a couple more years.  Like this is all organic juice.  Like I drink a big thing of juice every day.  So I try to stay healthy.  He's pretty healthy, but he doesn't sleep.  I'm a bad sleeper, but you're going days and days.  But at least you're trying to sleep.  I give it an A for effort.  Yeah.  The thing is, he's got to make money.  He's not like the E-Rock, you know? 
[00:48:30]  See, it's for cement, which could end up for me.  They're not as dry as cement.  No.  See, it's for cement.  See, it's for concrete.  What's good enough for me?  You don't think there's concrete in the cookie?  They are dry.  Not to the point that there's concrete.  Sam, you're going to lose the dry argument.  You monster.  Yeah, but there's not...  Too many people are saying they're dry.  You're going to lose that, unfortunately.  So what happened to all the cookies then?  How come half's gone?  Everyone was testing to see how dry they were.  Too many people have said they're dry. 
[00:49:00]  Jim tested like eight times.  Yes, but Jim's a compulsive asshole.  Jim's also paid for sex with dubious characters.  Jim also may have tried some duty in his life.  Yeah, exactly.  A dry cookie is easy to him.  Jim may have had a log fucking missling out of his mouth at one point.  At least it was moist.  Fuck.  So he laughs at dry cookies.  He laughs at them.  You got a key lime pie?  Oh, yes.  I'm good for right now.  Okay.  But thank you.  All right, Troy.  Thanks.  He's not sleeping.  You want to see a picture of my manager on the Ivory Coast? 
[00:49:30]  Oh, I saw that.  I saw.  I want to tweet that.  I asked Kenny if I could tweet that.  I'm not sure if we can.  Kenny sent that.  Wait till he's back.  Man, that's crazy.  He's a fucking African.  Where is he?  He's on the Ivory Coast of Africa.  He's with some surly looking Africans there.  Jonathan's standing in the picture.  Wait till he's back from Africa before he tweeted it.  Yeah, no problem.  He's with four Africans with machine guns and military garb in the street.  And that's where he decided to go for Christmas.  Yeah.  Why not?  Oh, he's Jewish.  He's Jewish, right?  Yeah, but still.  He's doing Hanukkah there right now. 
[00:50:00]  Hanukkah.  Does Hanukkah start today?  Tomorrow?  Tuesday.  Yeah, today.  Today is the first day of Hanukkah?  Well, happy Hanukkah, my Jewish friend.  That's why no one's around.  Yeah.  He says, since the rebels have taken over, the streets of Abidjan are safe.  Just don't get into long discussions about politics with them.  Happy holidays to the Ivory Coast, West Africa.  West Africa.  West Africa.  West Africa is a fucking unbelievably dangerous place to be. 
[00:50:30]  It is, right?  Yeah.  Yes.  The rebels are on the streets.  Why is he there?  The rebel base.  Where is the rebel base?  Is he CIA or something?  No, but I was thinking about Jonathan.  He just makes believe he's in entertainment?  How does he get away with this every time?  And I was thinking how, like, we look at people, and I mean all of us, like, they're just African  rebels.  They're dangerous guys.  We don't even see them as people.  Like, they're just this dangerous group.  But he'll actually, they know that when he meets somebody, he sees you as an individual.  He's really weird.  People sense that shit. 
[00:51:00]  That's a talent.  Like, he really is interested in them as a guy, and he can talk to them as a guy.  He doesn't see them as a rebel.  He sees them as a guy in a rebel outfit.  It's a really weird charisma he has with people.  But Americans are such, they're so valuable with kidnappings and shit like that.  It's a, I don't know how he hasn't just been absconded.  Don't know.  He's gone in.  He went to North Korea.  He did.  Oh, yeah.  Let's call him.  Um, I don't know who he's with.  I think he might be with his wife.  Let's try to call him, at least. 
[00:51:30]  He'll talk to us.  I love the Opie and Anthony Shaw.  I love it.  I want to, I mean, I'll text him right now and see if he's up.  Yeah, let's try to call him.  That's fucked up.  I want to know more about this.  It's just, dude.  I won't even leave my house at night to get milk.  And here he is in West Africa.  He's fearless.  It's crazy.  He really is fearless about traveling.  If he won't go somewhere, it's terrible.  Oh, it must be.  It's truly terrible.  But he goes everywhere.  He's been in North Korea.  You've said it.  Yeah, but that's not, that's not necessarily dangerous for tourists, though. 
[00:52:00]  No, I know.  Other people have gone, I've seen pictures from people that have gone to, like, Canadians.  I don't think it's easy to go to North Korea, right?  Probably not.  No.  Does he have dual citizenship?  No, just you ask.  He's gone to a lot of.  You've got to ask permission or something.  That's for Cuba.  I don't think, I don't, I think with North Korea, too, they're putting on the list of,  like, nations you can't just go into without saying, hey.  Why is he there?  I don't know.  He just, he loves other people like that.  He really enjoys, like, you don't know happiness until you've seen fucking him talking to some, 
[00:52:30]  like, West African or fucking Haitian, like, security guy in a parking garage.  Dude, he's an adventurer.  He's one of those adventurer guys, like, years ago, he would have had a pith helmet on and  a big elephant gun.  There's plenty of places to go do your adventuring.  An Iraq gun.  Oh, God.  The things he knows about their countries and about their cultures, no American white  guy should know.  They're out of their minds for Jonathan when they meet him.  They can't believe he knows this stuff.  He could literally talk to anybody. 
[00:53:00]  All right, something's going on there.  I told you, I thought he was an arms dealer or a gay male escort for a long time.  He should be in one of those white suits with a fedora, a white fedora, in one of those  bars with the fan on the ceiling made of palm leaves and just drinking whiskey with locals.  That's his fucking, that's how I picture him.  He just has that charisma where people like him.  He literally can talk to anybody.  I've never seen him in a larger conversation.  He's like Beloch.  Because he's so well-traveled that he can talk with guys who are, who have like, you 
[00:53:30]  know, celebrity or whatever, because everyone's interested in hearing about these weird places.  He's crazy.  He's a really interesting guy.  All right.  Passport must have some very unique stamps on it.  Yeah, but he went to Afghanistan like as a tourist.  Like he didn't go with the military.  Yeah.  You know, he went, I'm going to go to Dubai with him.  He showed me a cover.  He's got a cover for his passport.  You see that thing?  It's like a fucking different country that he puts his American passport in.  And so it just, if you see the passport, it's a cover from like, you know, another land 
[00:54:00]  that isn't the United States.  That's a little safer.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's smart.  So he's thought of all this shit.  Hopefully he'll text you back.  I want to talk to him.  That's a good idea that he does that.  He said, I'll tell you you're American in a lot of places.  Yeah.  Hey, does Mr. Fuji crumble those cookies up and then throw them into people's eyes?  You're thinking of salt.  Oh, oh, sorry.  Not the cookies.  I think that would render you, uh, yeah, blind.  When I was a kid, these cookies would get sprinkled in my eyes so I could sleep. 
[00:54:30]  That's not the case.  Yesterday, Jim showed me a picture of Jonathan's bulge.  I'll show you guys.  I didn't mean a new one.  No, like a good one.  Maybe they treat him nice because they think he's got a grenade in his pants.  He can blow it up at any time.  Giant gift.  Maybe it's just giant gift.  Maybe it's not balls.  He's mule and drugs.  Dude, he's got fucking balloons in the front of his pants.  He's all cock.  Yeah.  He's all cock, you're saying?  It looked very shaft-ish. 
[00:55:00]  Oh, shaft-y?  When he showed me the picture.  Yeah, I don't know where it is.  It might have been on your camera camera.  Oh, yeah, you're right.  Camera camera.  I guess we all got to make believe we don't want to see it, right?  Jimmy's on Instagram now, too.  I saw your little pictures on there.  I saw your picture with Sam.  I did, and I saw your picture, and I double-tapped it to make it that I like your picture.  Oh, I don't know how to work this.  All you've got to do is double-tap a picture, and it's like, I like it.  I like that picture.  Yes!  But Jimmy Norton is on there.  What's your name on there, Jimmy? 
[00:55:30]  Jim Norton.  Jim Norton.  Just go to Jim Norton, and you'll see, and then follow Jimmy.  Instagram is the new shit.  I already have like a thousand followers.  Do you do?  Yeah, and it was like two days.  Must be because I plugged it on the after show.  I heard that on my way home.  This is from the Tonight Show dressing room.  I forget why I snapped it.  Oh, my God.  I didn't mean to get his bulge, because I would have got a better shot of it.  Holy shit.  That is like an anaconda.  What's going on there?  It's Pesto.  Holy shit.  He missed it.  Pesto.  Oh, would you like to see a giant cock? 
[00:56:00]  You sure that's not one long ball?  No, it might.  If it isn't...  It's a little shaft-like.  He couldn't have hangers that big.  No, I don't think so.  I think it's dick.  That'd be a long, thin ball.  Would the cock be more down the leg?  I don't know.  It all depends on how he's sitting.  I think his jeans are tight, so he packs the whole thing into his little crotch.  Did you see the bulge?  When I showed you the bulge that one day?  It was amazing.  It's fucking awe-inspiring.  It was incredible.  Incredible.  It's a wonder of the world.  That's why it's so well-traveled. 
[00:56:30]  All over the world, yeah.  And he sees the pyramids, and then he says, hey, guys, look at my bulge.  Maybe it appears in exhibits.  Yeah.  He's at the pyramids, and tourists aren't even looking at the pyramids.  They're just snapping pictures of his bulge.  They leave without even looking at the sphinx.  They can't believe he's a white man in Africa.  That's why.  They think he's got black man DNA, so they leave him alone.  That is a Watusi ball bulge or whatever.  All right.  We're going to break.  Do some real eating, I guess.  Yes.  Some real food.  I'm not having my...  I fucking sprawled my appetite. 
[00:57:00]  Did you sprawl your appetite?  You ate too much.  Squeeze it.  Squeeze it.  Makes you feel better.  Give me the paper.  You don't have to start with one.  Whoa!  You got about three minutes.  All right.  Last show of the year.  Yep.  Wow.  Yes.  Yes, it is.  Last show of the year.  Tom Pop is in today.  He was rescheduled for tomorrow.  We're not even doing that.  And Von DiCarlo is coming in.  Yeah.  Patrice's Girl.  Patrice's Girl is coming in.  And Robert Kelly calling in from Aruba.  Yeah, he's plugging gigs.  I guess the Patrice O'Neill thing on Audible is doing really well. 
[00:57:30]  Is it?  Yeah.  With all money going to, of course, Patrice's Girl.  And Patrice's mom and Patrice's stepdaughter and many other people.  So very cool of SiriusXM to work that out with us.  They did a good job.  What do they do?  Go to Audible and do what?  Audible.com slash Patrice.  Or if you just go to Audible.com and search Patrice O'Neill, you'll see it's four parts.  Is it under an Opie and Anthony search as well?  Yeah, I'm sure it would be.  Because that might be easy for people.  It is, yeah.  Okay.  Go find it.  It's worth it.  It's for a great cause.  Helping out Patrice's family. 
[00:58:00]  It's 20 bucks, too.  It's nothing.  20 bills with no money going to us or the company.  Right.  16 hours of material for 20 bucks.  It's fucking amazing.  That's awesome.  All right, guys.  Blah, blah, blah.  Thanks for calling the Opie and Anthony F.U. line.  Here's the latest batch of F.U.'s.  Fuck you.  Yeah, I want to send a big fuck you out to Bobo and Jordan.

It's Fantagious Fourth Holiday.  If Ted Sheckler doesn't stock it, he'll find you a suitable substitute.  I don't have any parents' trees. I had a bush.  And if Ted Sheckler doesn't know what you're talking about, he'll make his best guess at what your family member might enjoy.  I don't know what a turtle dove is. It sounds like a crossbreeding.  From the obscure?  I got Minute Maids milking. That's milk in a Minute Maid container. 
[01:02:00]  To the traditional gold ring.  I do have that.  Well, almost.  Well, actually, they're not gold. They're black cock rings that I've spray-painted in gold.  The Ted Sheckler Happy Holiday Mega Fantastic Christmas Trinkets Emporium carries lots of things.  I have that.  You can get whatever you need.  Sirius XM  Sirius XM  The Opie and Anthony Show  She blinded me with science! 
[01:02:30]  Science!  Science!  Science!  We have a Thomas Dolby look-alike. It works here.  Are the speakers out there?  I don't think they are. It's awkward.  Remember Ho Ho Ho-y?  Ho Ho Ho-y.  I like this, though.  I love the Ho Ho Ho-y shit.  I did like this.  I liked when he came in and did this. He sort of did this. He had about 18 tracks and he played one live. One track live. 
[01:03:00]  Why are we trashing him? Gary Ho-y was clean as hell to us.  Turn this up.  You got to roll my legs.  Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  God damn it, Jihad. 
[01:03:30]  He's rocking out.  That Mission Impossible broad from yesterday.  I just got my picture from E-Rog.  Oh, yeah.  That chick is hot.  Yeah.  God damn it.  I totally photobombed Roland's picture.  Did you?  With them, yeah.  I had a perfect slide in between two people's heads. 
[01:04:00]  Nicey-nice.  Oh, yeah.  And who wants to be a slumdog millionaire guy?  I love Neil.  Milliner.  I guess he's really famous.  We didn't really care.  I felt bad.  You know, he's in there, and he's all famous, and we're just like, eh.  We talked to him, though.  Barely.  Yeah, but talked to him with disdain.  Oh, yeah.  Look at that.  I don't know.  Let me say.  Look at that shit.  All right.  There we go.  Look at that shit.  See an image.  Look at that shit.  Oh, yeah.  I don't have Instagram.  I'll have Instagram in two months. 
[01:04:30]  I'm excited.  All right.  Where's the ho-ho-ho-ho-y guy at these days?  This was another one that we came back.  I was saying to open Sam and Anthony, that the ding fries at Dunsall would make me sad  when we were kicked off the air, because it reminded me of the show.  And this was another thing that really connected me to the show, is this dumb, you're a mean  one, Mr. Grinches.  Yeah, I couldn't listen to it, because it reminded me of the show.  Oh, wait.  About the same way.  Oh, he did that at N.E.W. first?  Yeah, yeah.  He said he did it for us at XM when we first got back. 
[01:05:00]  Remember, that's why we called him Ho-ho-ho-ho-y, because the, uh, what was he?  Promotions guy?  Yeah, the guy that allegedly might have taken a lot of gold records from N.E.W.  I can get you to broadcast at Madison Square Garden next to the world's biggest Pop-Tart.  He was Pop-Tart Roger.  Oh, Roger.  That's right.  Pop-Tart Roger, we called him.  We were stupid, man.  That was great.  We should have went to the Giant Pop-Tart.  No, I'm talking about, I'm talking about when the shit was going down, when we knew 
[01:05:30]  N.E.W. was in deep trouble.  Yeah.  Everyone else started taking everything.  Oh, just pilfering.  Oh, they had Nirvana gold records signed and all, I mean, shit that the Rock and Roll Hall  of Fame would fucking cream their pants for.  Yeah.  And, uh, allegedly.  Scott Muni's body.  Scott Muni's body, sure.  And allegedly, I guess I won't mention names, but a lot of people, it's not alleged, a lot  of people just stole everything.  Remember the Zeppelin shit?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Fuck.  It was, uh, it was the world's largest rock and roll library. 
[01:06:00]  They had original tapes, uh, reel-to-reels of interviews with John Lennon and albums that  were just so rare and just stolen.  Springsteen just coming in and playing.  Yeah.  What?  How does that happen?  One-of-a-kind things.  Well, I wanted the gold records badly.  There was some Zeppelin stuff and, uh, Nirvana stuff I wanted really bad.  Yeah.  One day when we came to work, it was all gone.  And everyone was just looking the other way like, uh, what?  No, there was never anything on that wall.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh. 
[01:06:30]  Some stuff went missing from another rock station we worked at?  Yeah.  What station?  Yeah, I don't know.  It's just another rock station that we worked at that might have flipped a lot more recently.  Ah.  K-Rock?  It had a Rob Zombie golden record on the wall.  Ah.  Oh.  Please tell me you got the Rob Zombie record.  It's in my house.  Did you?  How'd you get it?  Eric and me went over, uh, when they were packing up after our last show.  And they didn't care?  Way too possible.  They didn't know.  Fuck them. 
[01:07:00]  They didn't pay nobody.  Good for you.  All the doors were gone.  There was no security.  And they left them laying around on the floor.  Because they were on the floor, where they were on the wall, but just laying against the  floor.  So we just took turns.  Eric would talk to somebody.  And I would walk to the office with one of them.  And then I would talk to a racket.  What did Eric get?  I got some good stuff.  You pulled a caper.  Eric, admit one.  Is there any Aussies?  It's like Ocean's Eleven.  No, otherwise I would have grabbed that for you.  What'd you get?  I got a Nirvana. 
[01:07:30]  What do you mean you got a Nirvana, you motherfucker?  And you didn't give it to Opie?  What's the Nirvana?  The, uh, what is it?  The lie from the muddy banks.  Opie would love that.  Is it signed by anyone?  Give it to Opie as a gift, so he could hang it in his brother's garage.  Oh, by the way, I don't know where that Islander thing is anymore.  I was there for Thanksgiving, and I couldn't find it.  That figures.  I forgot about that.  I meant to tell you.  He would probably eBay it.  He would?  That figures.  He's got to pay his oil bill.  How else is he going to pay?  I got the on-the-air light from NEW that's hanging over the compound studio to my basement. 
[01:08:00]  Is that where that's from?  Yeah.  It's from NEW.  We used to walk into that all the time.  And, uh, and a couple of cameras that may have figured their way into my basement.  Oh, yeah.  And maybe, maybe an instant replay machine.  Sure.  Wow.  I never think to take anything from you.  That's amazing.  You got to steal.  You got the, uh, the Aussie record from Lee Abrams.  Oh.  He gave me, yeah, but he gave me one, uh, but I'm not going to do it. 
[01:08:30]  I got so much Aussie stuff signed.  Like, I don't, an Aussie record I don't need.  I used to, I used to rip off radio stations blind and then go to the local record stores  and sell them all.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, I was desperate.  I had to fucking pay bills.  Like Kramer and Newman.  I used to be fucking Sam making no money.  I did what I had to.  So they would have promotional copies and stuff and, uh, and I would just take it all  and.  Irregular Oedipus Jr.  Well, they start shutting, shutting us down, man.  Some guys got in trouble.  Remember the Oedipus stories with him stealing the records? 
[01:09:00]  We don't know for sure.  I know.  I'm just saying there were stories.  To be honest.  That he was stealing records and, uh, well.  Bringing them and selling them.  Dude, it was, it was money from the record companies.  They would have, like, just a promotional, uh, copy of, uh, you know, whoever.  I'm trying to think.  One in general.  Butt Trumpet?  Butt.  Butt Trumpet.  And it was so valuable to the record collectors.  And you go to the local stores and they go, oh, yeah, we'll fucking make a deal.  Come follow me.  Why?  Because it's a promo?  It was more valuable?  Yeah, because no one could buy promo stuff. 
[01:09:30]  You could buy the regular shit.  Yeah, but they would do special copies for radio stations.  You know, maybe a live version that they officially didn't release.  How much were they worth?  Like, 50 bucks, 100 bucks back then?  Honestly, this goes back so far, I couldn't even tell you anymore.  I mean, it was, it was very, uh, lucrative.  Yeah.  It helped me get by when, uh, when the radio stations weren't paying me shit.  See, Sam, I've been there.  I know.  But you can't rip, you can't steal anything and sell it to anybody.  There's no record stores anymore.  No, no, no.  Take Rob Zombie stuff. 
[01:10:00]  Or, or they would just have box sets for giveaways.  And you'd have, like, 10 box sets.  You'd take one for yourself.  The program director would take one.  Oh, yeah.  And then we'd give out, and then we'd give maybe five away, and then, you know, we all  would secretly, you know, individually go to the record, uh, shops.  And then you'd go in there, it'd be awkward, because you would see, like, the WCMF stamp on  stuff, and you're like, huh, I wonder how that got there.  And the racks.  The K-Rock thing was such a joke, because I just remembered it wasn't, he didn't believe  me when I told him.  Well, the station wasn't technically flipping. 
[01:10:30]  They were moving.  And they were like, no, no, no, we're not flipping, we're just moving all this stuff.  Oh, yeah, sure you are.  So, Eric and me were like, we saw the writing on the wall, we were like, they're not putting  this stuff up anywhere.  Yeah.  It's just gonna get packed away.  Is the Rob Zombie thing worth anything?  I don't know.  It's worth something to you, because you love Rob Zombie, but I mean, if you...  It's either a gold, or it's a legitimate gold or platinum record of Hellbilly Deluxe.  I mean, yeah, I'm not saying it's fake platinum, whatever.  Do you like Hellbilly Deluxe?  Yeah, it's, I mean, it's his first solo album, it's amazing. 
[01:11:00]  You love him?  You like White Zombie, too?  Yeah.  He fucking loves, he's got the tattoo.  I know, you know all that.  I got a little video of him singing karaoke, some Rob Zombie karaoke.  Sam doesn't seem like a guy who would love Rob Zombie, because he's so into, like,  rap, and we always think you're a black guy, but...  Oh, boy.  That's this guy.  It's weird, though.  He's a crazy man for Rob Zombie.  He's a little homo form, I think.  One of his good friends coming in today.  Oh.  Tom Papa's very close with him.  Oh.  Well, Rob, they're, like, hang out, dinner friends.  That's fucked up. 
[01:11:30]  Makes me jealous.  I don't see that.  Why, why?  Tom, they did a project together years ago, but, like, Tom would go on a tour bus with him,  him and Cynthia would go to Ozfest last year, or about eight years ago, but they just went  on a bus with him.  They don't seem like two guys with him.  No, not at all.  Tom did a voice in Rob Zombie's animated movie.  Oh.  And now, yeah, Rob Zombie directed Tom Papa's comedy special.  That's a comedy special.  That's coming out.  He does comedy specials.  Oh, what?  Yeah.  And, uh...  Is it scary? 
[01:12:00]  It's gotta be.  It's actually a really good opening.  I saw the opening, actually.  It's fucking very good.  Zombie's a good man.  He's a weird director.  He's got his own...  But when you see something, you're like, yep, that's him.  Isn't that weird?  His last name's Zombie, and he took that path in life to be like...  It's just such a great coincidence.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Sometimes it just works out.  I should be Chip Wild.  All right, so anyway...  I'm not Chip Wild.  Ew.  You're embarrassing.  You're a sick fucking puppy.  Yeah.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  Chip Rocca.  You don't like Chip Wild? 
[01:12:30]  Chip Wild?  No, I don't.  I like it so much, I'm turning green with envy.  Oh, look at that.  It's my joke.  I'm sorry, Chip.  It's a good one.  Tom Papa's in at 8.30.  I told you, his friendship's making me sick.  It's weird, because he seems so straight-edge.  Like, how does he hang out with Rob Zombie?  Although Rob Zombie doesn't really do much of anything, right?  Rob Zombie's like a vegetarian.  Yeah, and he doesn't drink your drug or any of that shit.  Not really.  It's not even Zombie.  It's the fact that he's...  All right, then he goes up, he's friends at Seinfeld. 
[01:13:00]  Right.  Who?  And then he's friends at Eastwood.  Eastwood loves him.  He's flown on Clint's plane.  He's still...  Clint?  Oh, yeah, he's told the Clint Eastwood story.  I know.  It really annoys me.  Does he still like him, though?  Yes.  Clint, I mean?  Yeah.  Well, really?  Hey, who saw this coming?  Chaz Bono and the fiancé there call off their engagement and their relationship.  Holy shit.  What's the matter?  The wife figured out the husband had no dick?  That'll put a damper on any marriage.  I mean, if you're going to have a husband, shouldn't he have a dick? 
[01:13:30]  Should have a dick.  I think.  My dick.  Well, I think she wants to be with a broad, and all of a sudden, her broad turns into a dude without a dick.  Yeah.  That got confusing.  So she finally said, fuck this.  That's a sign of some real mental instability when you get engaged.  With people that get engaged, right?  Mm-hmm.  And then lickety-split, they're not engaged anymore, and they're broken up.  Unless there's some cataclysmic cheating event or something.  But if you change your mind that quickly with something that important, it seems to me like there's some issues. 
[01:14:00]  And I think you could determine there were some issues prior to just calling off a wedding.  Yeah, what told you there were issues?  When the breast got cut off?  Yeah.  Yeah.  She fucking grew a beard.  Grew a beard like fucking George Michael.  Yeah.  Well, what happens?  You used to be like, you know, Chastity, and now you're like Kenny Loggins.  What happened?  She was a great guest, though, right?  I loved her.  Yeah, she was all right, man.  She was way better than I thought she would be.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[01:14:30]  Very open and honest, and she answered everything we asked her.  That's all you ask of a guest is just fucking answer the question.  I'm still beyond confused by this whole fucking thing.  Yeah, me too.  That's all you ask?  Son, all I've ever asked of my Marines is for them to obey my orders as they would the word of God.  Word of God.  Word of God.  Because Chaz's chick there likes girls, but now the girl she was with is now a sort of dude.  I call it a sort of dude.  That's got to be confusing.  Then the girl came in.  Yeah.  Penis.  What are they saying? 
[01:15:00]  Oops.  You're right.  You're right.  I leaned on it.  I'm a big fan of Dr. Bellows, aren't you?  I always think that's Robin Williams when you're doing this.  Major Bellows kind of sounded a little like...  A major?  Doctor?  Oh, Dr. Bellows, yeah.  Okay.  Dr. Bellows.  All I've ever asked of a guest is that they just answer questions.  Yes.  Son, all I've ever asked of my Marines is for them to obey my orders as they would the word of God.  God.  God.  God. 
[01:15:30]  Such a reasonable request, isn't it?  It is.  It's reasonable.  Son.  The word of God.  Like, if God came down and asked him something, you should listen to this guy with equal intensity.  The best part is the setup where he goes, son, all I've ever asked of my Marines.  Like, it's reasonable.  It's reasonable.  Until the last word.  All I ever ask.  Which is a reasonable thing.  It's like, look, I'm not asking anything crazy.  Just that you take my word as you would the word of God.  It's completely rational until the last moment. 
[01:16:00]  Son, all I've ever asked of my Marines is for them to obey my orders as they would the word of God.  God.  All I've ever asked.  He's the greatest.  That's a hilarious line.  What's that supposed to be?  Some kind of sick joke?  Sick joke?  That guy's the greatest character ever in a movie.  What's that supposed to be?  Some kind of sick joke?  Do you love your country?  Yes, sir.  How about getting with the program?  Why don't you jump on the team and come on in for the big win?  And he's the second half of the movie.  Dude, he's the first half.  That's unbelievable.  That's his only scene.  Yeah, that's his only scene.  And the first half is so amazing.  He's great.  Uh, so Chad said on Twitter, uh, thanks for your concern about our separation. 
[01:16:30]  I'm doing fine and we remain on good terms with nothing but respect and affection for each other.  Oh.  Because they are dunsky.  And no penis.  No penis.  I think for no penis.  No dick will, uh, fuck a relationship up, I think.  But maybe she doesn't want the penis, but she certainly doesn't want the beard.  Mmm.  She wants everything to be soft.  You think?  And pillow...  Yeah.  Because that one's a lesbian, the dark-haired?  Yes. 
[01:17:00]  It's just so confusing, this whole, uh, thing.  The whole thing just drives me...  Transgendered, as I would call them politically correct.  I just don't understand.  There's a guy that, um, should absolutely be put to death here in New York and, uh, it's  not gonna happen.  Oh my god.  The, uh, the, uh, the, uh, the guy that lit that lady on fire in the elevator.  Oh, lit the old lady on fire in the elevator.  He's all burnt up too.  Great picture in the paper today, man.  His skin is falling off his face because he got burned too.  It looks like beef jerky's peeling off his, uh... 
[01:17:30]  Oh, fuck cheeks.  But, brings up something we like to bring up a lot.  We have a death penalty here in New York that we have never used.  It was such a joke when the politicians...  Who was it?  Pataki at the time?  Yeah.  Pataki put it, you know, put it in?  Everybody was like, oh, woo, belt time.  Everyone was like, all right, yay, and, and I don't even know how many years at this point,  and we haven't, uh, killed one fucker yet.  With some of the most heinous crimes that have happened, and, and just, uh, nothing.  And, and a lot of situations you get like, I don't, I don't believe in the death penalty  because too many things happen, there's cases of mistaken identity and things like that. 
[01:18:00]  This case is perfect for the death penalty.  He's on video.  He has a background with a problem with this woman.  He's on video spraying her with gas.  He smells like gas, and then he's all burnt up.  Yeah.  He did it.  Yeah.  He did it.  Yeah.  So, so, kill him.  And the funny thing is, people would call up and go, this isn't even a death penalty case.  What are you guys talking about?  I don't give a fuck.  This is a death penalty case in my eyes.  Why wouldn't this be a death penalty case?  It's murder one. 
[01:18:30]  I'm sure there's some kind of twist.  It's fucking premeditated murder.  Of course it's a fucking death penalty case, you dummies.  Last execution in New York, 1963.  1963.  I think the cop killer should be put to death.  Oh, yeah, absolutely.  Is that a death penalty case?  Cop killer should be.  In the commission of a crime, I think it is.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That would be a death penalty case.  Absolutely.  They had an unbelievable send-off for the guy out there on Long Island.  Holy fuck, the pictures coming in, the loyalty and the brotherhood.  Oh, my God.  So many fucking, just a sea of blue, all the hats. 
[01:19:00]  Yes.  It looks amazing.  I mean, unfortunately, it's for that.  Yeah.  But, boy, they sure do know how to make a showing.  It's amazing.  Last person put to death was 1963.  When was the death penalty put back in?  I'm trying to think, but that's got to be...  90?  I'm going to say 20 years.  Something?  I'd guess 20 years.  Robert Johnson, I think, was a DA in the Bronx where he wouldn't go after it.  Morgenthau wouldn't pursue it.  Yeah, that's what it happened. 
[01:19:30]  The DAs were so anti-death penalty that just having the law there, it means shit.  Why have a death penalty if you're not going to use it?  It's just political wrangling.  They're more liberal appointees, I think.  Oh, yeah.  So stupid.  1995.  Well.  So what, 16 years?  16 years ago?  Yep.  With not one guy.  They didn't use it on one guy.  16 years, not one guy.  Not a war.  And I think in 16 years in New York State, there's probably been some crimes that have  probably been a steal. 
[01:20:00]  Absolutely merited the death penalty.  But...  Bunch of jack-offs.  That's what they are.  Fucking 49ers, man.  I'm telling you, I'm picking these guys to win...  To go all the way?  ...the Super Bowl.  I'm going with Tim Tebow.  I'm doing it today.  I'm doing it today.  Because fucking defenses win Super Bowls.  And the 49ers are ridiculously good.  They beat Pittsburgh 20-3.  Although Roethlisberger was looking like fucking Lurch or Frankenstein out there. 
[01:20:30]  He could barely move.  Really?  I don't know if he should have even played.  I don't know.  I don't know that shit.  But 23.  Did you see the lights go out?  No, I wasn't watching.  The whole fucking lights went out.  I heard about that on the news.  And the broadcast cut out and everything?  Yeah.  Pitch dark.  Whoa.  That's got to be a little scary in a stadium.  Wondering, you know.  Why?  It's going to be pandemonium.  Nah, you just sit there.  Pandemonium. 
[01:21:00]  You just sit there and let everyone else do their shit.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, man.  Especially if you're in the middle of a row.  You're good.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Protected.  If you're on, I don't know, the end there, it might be rough with everyone getting out.  But you're good.  Did you just sit there?  Did they light some candlesticks?  One of Sam's cookies just rolled across the console.  How dare you?  The tumbleweed cookie. 
[01:21:30]  You should, I had to knock a fucking cat off of the console.  He was scratching at it.  He was going to shit in it.  No, there's no cat.  See, kitty litter.  49ers.  There you go.  Steven S. from Bayshore is going, why did you do that to all the 49ers fans?  What?  I'm good.  My sports picks are fucking solid, man.  They're solid these days.  Damn. 
[01:22:00]  Who you got for the Super Bowl?  You know what?  I got to go with either.  I'm not counting the Broncos out.  What?  I know the miracle is over.  Not even a chance.  You know, you just don't know with this fucking, he's a wild card.  He's got Jesus.  Mm-hmm.  But I'm thinking Green Bay, probably.  Packers?  Yeah.  Doing it all?  Go Pack Goal.  Go Pack Goal?  Go Pack Goal.  What about the Pats?  Eh, fuck the Pats.  You don't like the Pats?  Nah.  What's wrong with the Pats?  I just don't think they're going to do it this year. 
[01:22:30]  Sorry.  Sorry.  Sorry, Pats fans.  Yeah.  Where is this?  I'm going to try something.  What are you doing?  Oh, nothing.  You're trying some?  No.  No.  We just said that out loud.  Yeah, you definitely are.  You just said that.  No, no, no.  What?  Oh.  Sixteen candles.  What are you trying?  What? 
[01:23:00]  Did you say something?  What?  Ah!  Ah!  The police are here!  The police!  You dummy.  It was supposed to get the people in their cars.  Oh.  You know how that works?  That old gag?  We used to do pretty well with that.  But wouldn't we have to keep talking?  Oh, yeah.  We didn't set it up properly.  No.  Like, we should keep talking.  It was a horrible setup. 
[01:23:30]  Well, you did a good job, Sam.  Ant, why are you holding that to the mic?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Where did you get that?  What is that?  I don't know.  It's just some dumb app.  What's the app called?  Get Out of My Way.  So you walk down the hallway and go like this.  No, but that wouldn't work because you're not a car.  It should flash green.  Everybody would think you're envious.  Wait.  Yeah.  How does that app work in your favor?  I don't get it.  I don't know.  It's just a dumb app.  I thought it would be fun.  I was trying to think how it would work in your favor.  I thought it would be fun to play it over the microphone and have people go like, ah, 
[01:24:00]  and look in the rear view.  They always get scared.  Yeah.  People get frightened when they hear that.  We used to do that all the time.  Or the phone ringing was a good one.  What do you guys think of?  The old days.  What do you guys think of Barney Frank's nipples on TV yesterday?  Oh, my God.  That video went everywhere.  Not just nipples.  Giant Fred Flintstone body tits.  Oh, wow.  Man, I don't know what's going on there.  He's got big fucking meat tits.  Too many men tugging on him for too many years.  Yeah, he probably likes intense nipple play.  Nipple play.  I think he was advertising. 
[01:24:30]  He was.  For future nipple play because he's got some fucking nipples and boobs.  With the shirt, it was horrific.  Could you imagine what that looks like without the shirt?  No, man.  Oh, it's god awful.  I hate my tits.  They're not like that.  I got to fucking work on my chest all the goddamn time, but I don't look like that shit.  Does it help when you get lipo?  That really helps.  Yeah, I guess.  The Rock did it.  Did he?  No, he didn't.  The Rock says, suck my fat. 
[01:25:00]  The Rock got some shit sucked out of his chest years ago.  There were rumors.  Oh, yeah.  Because he's got that big Samoan body.  They're known for their abnormally large breasts and nails.  Meh.  Look at Barney Frank.  Jimmy, you didn't see this?  I did see this.  You did see it?  No, now I just saw it.  Oh, look at this.  Look at this.  He's literally got Johnny.  He looks like Meatloaf in Fight Club.  Yes!  Look at those tits.  Look at the bitch tits.  That's bitch tits.  Holy shit.  They're big side titties and his nipples are cross-eyed. 
[01:25:30]  Why is his arms out like that?  Well, he's got a broken arm or something.  So he couldn't put his jacket on.  Yeah.  Because the jacket would cover up that shit.  How did he bring his own?  Jerking off.  I have been very impressed.  Did you like Barney Frank?  No.  He's way too liberal for me, but he's needed to balance it out a little bit.  Need a little balance?  Yeah.  I don't hate him.  There's his big giant bitch tits. 
[01:26:00]  I like the fact that he fucked hookers.  I hate balance when it's not in my favor.  I like that.  You see some of those Occupy Washington people?  They did a little social experiment.  They took a living nativity scene, and they sat down in their little circle, their little  encampment, and were completely harassed by the Occupy people saying, this isn't about  religion.  Get out of here.  Instead of, you know, hey, everybody's doing their own thing here and showing what you 
[01:26:30]  believe in.  They were saying, it offends me.  How about the things that you're offending people, and people are saying that, and you  say, we have a right to do this, that, and the other thing, and they were literally bad-mouthing  these people, trying to get them away.  They just want to make their own rules.  That's all.  Crank the volume up a little bit.  That's what this is about.  Yeah, they have this goddamn song playing on the background.  God damn it.  They're saying to church, man. 
[01:27:00]  The protest is right up in their face.  Is that legal?  Another one's asking.  Out of respect, I would move it.  He's a follower of Islam because it's cool. 
[01:27:30]  Do you think the activity scene over there is in bad taste?  It's in bad taste.  The atrocities of the Christian faith is rubbish humanity.  Oh, really?  And he's Islamic, he says.  He's some white kid that follows up Islamic.  I think he would offend other people.  All right, we heard enough, but the whole thing is, they're saying, dude, they're telling  him to leave. 
[01:28:00]  They're just voicing their opinion, though.  Their opinion, though, is the same fucking opinion.  People walk up to them and say, you offend me, get a job, you don't belong here.  But I thought there was way more outrage, that's all.  They're pretty much just...  How about you fucking accept everybody?  What happened to this social community where everything's accepted?  What a bunch of horse shit.  I'm glad this whole scene is dead.  Their whole Occupy thing is dead.  A lot of people say it's not dead.  Oh, it's dead. 
[01:28:30]  They're regrouping.  Dead is Kim Jong-il.  They've gone indoors.  Not to be confused with Kim Jong-un.  Kim Jong, right?  Kim Jong.  Now Kim Jong dead, not Kim Jong-il.  Kim Jong dead.  And Kim Jong-un.  Un is the new guy.  In.  But did Kim Jong-il have five hole-in-ones in one round of golf or 11?  What?  You don't know this?  No.  He's the greatest golfer of all time.  Oh, oh.  But I heard it was 11 hole-in-ones in one round of golf. 
[01:29:00]  He's amazing.  Did they really just let him do that?  Of course.  What?  Did they just let him do that?  With the rules, you know.  The whole country believes it.  I think it's five, but I heard 11, too.  There's a whole bunch of things.  Did we do the list of things that the country believes he did?  You're a good caddy.  That's something to be very proud of.  You're a tarot type whereby gunning for him.  He have as good as he say he is.  He got to pray me to prove it.  Very good.  Where's the list of things that the country believes that this guy did? 
[01:29:30]  It's a pretty amazing list.  Greatest golfer ever.  I think his first round of golf, he shot 38.  38.  38.  That's impossible.  It's not impossible.  Maybe they all know he's full of shit and just they know they can't say it.  Somebody help me.  Dr. Beep have been crop champion five years running and I know Shrouch myself.  That's funny. 
[01:30:00]  We got to find that list of shit because it's good, man.  They believed a lot of things he did.  I'm trying to remember.  Yeah.  You know some of the stuff?  No.  I just know he was a horrible fucking tyrannical leader that fucked his country up, starves his people, and it kind of sucks to live there.  You got it, Sam?  No.  All right.  I'll look too, man.  Somebody have it?  Somebody have a link?  Easy to green when ship come in and you got the stock market beat, but the man who could smile, the man who's worthwhile, but his shots are too tight in seat or something. 
[01:30:30]  I fucked that the lineup.  No, you didn't.  Yeah, you did pretty good.  Smile.  Sometimes when we touch, you're on a steeze too much.  You like that song, Jimmy?  It's lovely.  That I have to.  Yeah, you like that one?  Fuck it.  My friend will start, he can really sing.  Yeah.  He will belt that out and it's so uncomfortable. 
[01:31:00]  I bet.  Because it's a guy really singing it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Sometimes when we touch.  Is he good, though?  Oh, he's hilarious, but I was like, God, you can sing it.  He goes, well, I sing on the side, like in a cover band.  I'm like, oh, my God.  Yeah, yeah.  And he sings that one?  But he means it.  Yeah, I want to steeze too much.  And you realize what a terrible song that is.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, that is a horrible song. 
[01:31:30]  There it is.  I think I might have found it.  Who did this song?  I don't know.  Dan Hill?  Dan Hill.  I love you.  And I choke on my reply.  It's just a very airy.  I'd rather hurt you honestly than mislead you with me.  With a cry.  I'm going to croon it.  Who am I to judge you? 
[01:32:00]  When words you say are true or do or something.  The crooner.  Let's sing it like a douchebag.  The fucking puppies doesn't cover this.  I want to hear that.  Sometimes I touch you with a knife.  Whoa.  The honesty is too much.  This song used to make me sad because I was in love with a girl in junior high that didn't love me. 
[01:32:30]  I did.  And for no reason.  You're saying it's a treat for your mouth.  For no reason whatsoever, I tied this song to how I felt about the girl.  Oh, you fucking made me sick.  You know why it makes you sick?  Because you're thinking of yourself too, faggot.  Of course, I'm awful.  Faggot.  Please.  Babe.  My six was my first song with a girl.  But I used to walk by a girl's house with Iron Man playing.  I think I was cool.  But no, it's because I know the line is when we both, you hold each other and both break down and cry.  Like you thought you and the girl were going to hold each other.  Why couldn't we though, Jimmy? 
[01:33:00]  And realize your love.  But no, she didn't even know who I was.  And I don't know why I equated this song to our non-existent relationship.  But she was, like when I saw her, this was the song.  You would have both cried.  And her would she realize what a drunk you are.  And you wouldn't realize you couldn't fuck other girls anymore.  You want to hear about Kim Jong-il?  I found the list.  It's terrific.  Sometimes when we touch.  No, it wasn't Dreamweaver, you asshole. 
[01:33:30]  Oh, going to get Tom Papa.  Why do you have to go get Tom Papa?  Why don't we have a staff?  We're still working.  What happened?  You're on air right now.  It's Christmas.  It's Christmas.  No one's here.  No one's here.  Can you imagine other shows doing this?  See you right back, guys.  I thought we were going to both break down and cry.  I thought I was going to hold her.  So the fear in me sits up.  What kind of fear did I have?  Being called a homo for holding a doll.  Maybe.  You should have sang that. 
[01:34:00]  That's true.  Break down and cry with you.  I know.  When you fall in love for the first time, you do dumb shit.  Oh, it was just.  It was.  I used to like Open Arms by Jerry.  That's it.  And go listen to the words.  This is our song.  Yeah.  Do you think they described you in the lyrics?  Of course.  You know what?  When you fell in love back in your teens and stuff like that in school,  it was totally all-encompassing every second of the day. 
[01:34:30]  You couldn't do anything else.  You couldn't do anything else but think about it.  Nothing.  It was a plague.  It was a blight.  And it was something that was fantastic and horrible.  Horrifying.  It was just terrible.  Because then you would think about it ending or something.  Yes.  And it would.  But when you were in it, it was like this.  It was so much more than it is now.  Now it's just what it is, you know?  This is a good one, though. 
[01:35:00]  This is a good one, yeah.  It's a good tune.  Do you come with open arms?  No, I cheat.  No, everything's closed.  My phone is locked.  Open arms, locked phone.  That's right.  You couldn't do your homework.  You couldn't fucking hang out with your friends anymore.  You couldn't do shit.  It was a constant adrenaline rush that you were constantly getting butterflies and whooshes.  It was a nightmare.  And then. 
[01:35:30]  There was too much pressure.  And that was when you were just alone thinking about it.  Right.  Then when you saw the girl.  Oh, forget it.  It was crazy.  Crazy.  You looked like such an idiot.  I was a madman for being in love.  You mean when you were dating her or when you just liked her?  No, he's talking about.  No.  He's talking about this fucking.  Being in fucking love.  This junior high, high school love shit.  I was in love.  Where you thought this was it.  You would never see another girl in your life.  I wouldn't even look at it.  Like, I would look at other girls and think, oh, she's disgusting compared to, you know,  whoever.  You're so right.  You couldn't even see any other good looking girls. 
[01:36:00]  No, they weren't good looking.  It was like that.  No one else was good looking.  No.  You couldn't even acknowledge that.  No.  And then they fuck you over.  And you try to break your arm in your garage with a baseball bat to garner sympathy.  Oh, I forgot.  I forgot.  Oh, Jimmy.  Oh, yeah.  Time pop up.  Yeah, I literally did that, Jimmy.  I know.  It disgusts you.  But I couldn't really commit to it.  So I just wound up bruising my arm. 
[01:36:30]  I'm talking about being in love in, like, junior high.  And the girl broke up with me and actually went out with one of my friends.  So I went into the garage with a baseball bat, tried to break my arm to get sympathy from her.  Like, oh, look, I have a broken arm.  How could you break up with me when I now have a broken arm?  So I took the bat and would swing it.  And I kind of hold up.  I bunt.  I kept bunting instead of swinging away on my arm.  I thought you were body's own self-defense.  Of course it is.  Like, you want to keep going.  My brain was calling me an idiot, but my heart said, swing away.  Swing away. 
[01:37:00]  You couldn't really commit.  No, I couldn't commit to the pain.  I punched a brick wall in Geneseo over and over again to get the attention of a girl.  Yeah.  That didn't give a fuck about me.  You punched it in front of her?  No.  Just if I had, like, kind of a broken hand that somehow that would make her pay more attention  to me.  Yeah.  Fucking pathetic.  I would pretend that I was in a fight.  I rode off on my bike and, like, ripped my T-shirt, pulled the neck, ripped the T-shirt.  How you pictured someone had been in a fight with look.  Messed my hair up and came back. 
[01:37:30]  I was just in a fight and I was attacked in the woods by some guys.  Just looking at me.  Did she believe you?  No.  I didn't look like I was in a fight.  I looked like I woke up.  I think my broken hand idea, it would make me look tough if I had a cast.  And that would somehow make her go, fuck, he's a real man.  I'm the asshole.  See?  We all have the same dumb idea.  That somehow some physical thing was going to make her emotionally like you again.  Yeah.  And it never worked.  By the way, Iraq has decided to go with a love soundtrack. 
[01:38:00]  In back.  Oh.  Of us.  He's just picking songs now.  Yeah.  No, Tom, but Anthony made a great point and something I forgot about a long fucking time  ago.  When you fell in love for the first time, basically, like, junior high, high school, whenever  the fuck it happened, I had a real falling in love for the first time where you couldn't  do anything else with your life.  It was all encompassing.  Nothing.  You couldn't even hang out with your family.  You couldn't do shit.  You would just sit around waiting for the next time you could either talk to her or see  her.  You had no idea what was happening to you either. 
[01:38:30]  No, nothing.  You were just being swept away by this.  What the fuck is this emotion?  I'm in love.  I'm not going to see my friends.  My parents are going to be mad because I'm not doing anything I'm supposed to be doing.  I'm just obsessing over this girl.  But we're saying it was too much pressure for a young kid like that.  Yeah, you're completely out of your mind.  You're completely out of your mind.  I was in fifth grade and I fell in love with Suzanne Moore and she was freckly and she 
[01:39:00]  was big and I all of a sudden...  She was big?  Was she a fatty?  I had...  No, she was tall.  She was kind of tall.  Oh, tall girl.  Yeah, and I have a picture of it, literally, of me.  All of a sudden, I went from being a kid in a t-shirt to wearing a button-down shirt and  I rolled up the sleeves just up to the arm and then unbuttoned to mid-chest and I had  like a little communion necklace that I had.  I wore that so the chain would be like right in the V of where my shirt was on and I'm 
[01:39:30]  like walking...  Very calculated.  All of a sudden, I'm like, Don Watt.  I really thought I was like Saturday Night Fever, like John Travolta.  Ah, John Travolta.  Yeah, yeah.  You were like Travolta, but not in the ways that you thought.  You were like Travolta on the steps of a plane.  There's another photographer looking.  Bidding adieu to a close friend.  Yeah.  Just give me a hug, Jess.  But we used to go out... 
[01:40:00]  There was this little nature trail and we used to walk down the nature trail and make  out and it was so early that we didn't even know what making out was.  We would just smoosh our faces together.  Yeah, you bring a song.  Didn't open a mouth at all.  On TV.  But all day, all night, I would wait and think about when we get back on the nature trail.  Would your genitals get funny?  Would they get a little funny?  They would jump on me.  They got hilarious.  Like, what is going on down there?  That's exactly...  There was this girl named Donna Yonkey, spelt with a J. 
[01:40:30]  I think they were from New Mexico.  Of course they were.  And they moved to Central Islip in the apartment complex I lived in.  And this girl was, I guess, the grade lower than me.  And I was in, like, probably third grade.  So this is really early on.  And we used to go down into the basement of the apartments and make out.  Really?  Which amounted to, like you said, closed mouth, just squishing lips together and trying to move  your head around and look, you know, look like Cary Grant. 
[01:41:00]  It's true.  That's all you would do is wiggle your head a little.  That is it.  Wiggle your head.  And then looking around when you heard a sound, hoping, you know, somebody wasn't looking.  And this bitch, this little fucking bitch...  Broke your heart.  I wanted to keep doing this because it was great.  It made my genitals feel funny.  And then she started going out with this other kid down, Michael.  Started going down with Michael into the basement.  I saw her and Michael go down the steps to the basement one day.  And I'm like, what the fuck? 
[01:41:30]  That was like walking into a bedroom and seeing your wife with another man.  At least she wasn't going down with Leroy.  Yeah.  And as a matter of fact, in the Central Islip apartment buildings,  there was one apartment that was just for black people.  Like all the other apartment buildings were white people, white people, white people.  They put all the black people in one apartment.  This is 1971, 72 maybe.  And yeah, if I saw her go down those stairs, oh boy.  Good riddance.  That was so heartbreaking. 
[01:42:00]  Remember that empty feeling though you had when it fucking fell apart?  Because that was a disaster of an emotion too.  How do you handle that at a young age?  I had to stand at the bus stop with them.  And I'm like, fucking, I got my dumb school bag.  And I'm looking at them like, you fucking prick.  You're all sweaty, man.  It takes a little piece of you away forever.  Yeah, that was it.  Forever.  That was a little chunk taken away of all the chunks that have been taken away  that made me what I am right now as I fucking sit here.  A bitter man.  Oh, she's the worst. 
[01:42:30]  Afraid of things being taken away.  That's why you hate Obama.  Ah, yeah, see?  I was so...  Did he go to the basement with Donnie Yonkey?  He probably did.  He probably did.  He probably did.  Smooth.  More importantly, how's the cookie, Tom?  You just had one.  Amazing.  Oh.  It's really good.  It's solid.  Not too dry?  It's too dry.  It's a solid mom cookie.  Yeah, it's a mom cookie, all right?  It was.  It's homemade.  That thing's terrible.  Homemade mom cookies from Sam's mom.  Well, no, I thought they were like deli store-bought,  and I was like, these are good for being in a deli. 
[01:43:00]  That's great.  Yeah.  I didn't know how to kiss a girl, so I asked Jill.  I've told this story in the air before.  It was in fourth grade.  We were in the woods area.  I'm like, I want to ask you something.  She's like, okay.  I'm like, you know what my favorite band is, right?  Oh, that's right.  Every time I hear this, I fucking cringe.  And she just ignored me. 
[01:43:30]  She shuts up cigars and scotch and says, she should have went queen.  Cigars and scotch always with the funny one.  Maybe David Bowie's.  What?  Oh, Chip.  I don't know how to ruin everything.  Oh, my God.  That's awesome.  That's brutal.  How humiliating.  That's great.  I remember when I first got back, we would make out and squish faces, and then I just  didn't know what to do with my hands, and then I was like, I went up her, like, was 
[01:44:00]  holding her skin, like, her back.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Crazy.  And I went back, and I was like, I think I got to second.  I think I got to second.  My friends were like, what, you took off her bra?  Like, what do you mean took it off?  You were picked off at first.  Right?  That's what happened.  You were out thrown.  Yeah, exactly.  You ran the wrong way.  You ran to the on-deck circle.  And spun around.  But speaking of which, you remember the pressure of trying to get that bra off casually?  Oh, for God.  Because it wasn't all about, like, I'm going to just take your fucking bra off.  It was like, you're trying to work it? 
[01:44:30]  8,000 steps.  Fuck.  You're 8,000 steps forward.  Oh, I understand.  I'm switching mouth, kids.  It was so much pressure, because you never saw one before, and you had no idea how it  worked.  And if she was a bit big on top, there was a bunch of snaps.  What was that about?  Yeah, that first, like, training bras were just like, fuck.  It looks like those final, it looks like that final place they fastened the cables on the  Verrazano Bridge.  Like that final big block of cement.  And you're there with your little nine-year-old hand.  Just trying to get those nine-foot diameter bolts off. 
[01:45:00]  Because you finally get to an age, like, we all know what's going on here.  Let's just do this.  But back then, it was like, everything had to be, like, fucking undercover.  And you knew if it wasn't smooth, it was over.  Oh, fuck, yeah.  It would kill the whole thing.  Kill the mood.  Because she wanted to make believe it.  It's just, you know, there's an oopsie happening.  Right.  Maybe this will work.  We had talked also previously about how square dancing in gym class was a sexual experience  in a way.  Because you went to school with these girls all the time. 
[01:45:30]  You saw them, but you never touched them at all.  Unless, you know, you were going out smushy face with one girl.  But these are just the regular girls you're with.  And now you're holding hands, like, you're all in the circle.  So you're just holding hands with a girl was like, ugh.  And then I'm like, oh, I don't want Pam Bernfeld.  Could you move?  Could you move?  Because I want that girl's hand.  Everybody was moving around.  Everyone's jockeying for positions.  You didn't know who the fuck you were going to get until the last second.  But then when you're, like, doing the promenade, and you got your arm around the girl.  Yeah, it was like, wow, I'm touching this girl. 
[01:46:00]  And you fucking, again, you're just like, ah, you're freaking out.  I want to go back to the bra thing again, though.  Because another memory.  So it's four snaps.  Four.  You get the first one done.  You're like, all right.  Second one done.  And if you ever got to the fourth where it just was unleashed, you're fucking, you would  start fucking foaming.  Well, you get more, you get more, um, tension on each one that you take off.  So the last one's got a lot of tension holding it. 
[01:46:30]  But sometimes you'd only get, she'd allow, these girls were weird.  Sometimes they would only allow you to do one or two and keep the other two on.  Oh, yeah, they're freaking out.  I know.  But even if you got all four off and that thing went free.  But if it went free, you still then had to come back to the front and try and go up.  Right.  And then you could be stopped there, too.  You could be stopped there.  It was a minefield.  Oh, man, was it?  A minefield.  That's why this was the cure-all for the stop.  You got it?  You got it?  Oh, boy.  What happened?  Oh, jeepers. 
[01:47:00]  You know what?  My goddamn template's ripped.  And by the way, you just dated yourself because Mr. Coffee's like square dancing in gym class.  Yeah, we did square dancing in gym class.  Did you square dance in gym, Tom?  It was before I could get back to the box.  Well, it probably ended with this whole PC shit where, like, look, we can't have fucking,  you know, girls and boys touching each other in class.  Exactly.  Right.  Because, like, Anna said in the past, that's like having sex. 
[01:47:30]  When you're 11, 12 years old, that's like, holy fuck, that's hardcore sex.  Could you imagine being the teacher, like, when all the kids came back from that class all sweaty,  their eyes big?  Oh, man.  Just fucking boners in everyone's pants.  Pre-cum and everybody's in front of their...  Trying to teach them about the Gettysburg Address.  Yeah.  Good luck.  Oh, they had to know.  They were just...  Yeah, because you know what just happened the period before.  You're like, did that just happen?  Was I basically having sex with that girl?  It was like Pavlov's dog when you heard the motor that opened up that accordion door at the gym 
[01:48:00]  and combined the girls and boys' side of the gym.  You'd hear like...  Yeah, you're just freaking out, swinging from the ropes.  Just in heat.  Sniffing crotches.  Imagine being the girl that was the first one to get tits before she was...  Yeah.  I mean, think about the torture that that girl went through.  I remember this girl in sixth grade.  We came back from fifth to sixth grade. 
[01:48:30]  It was our last year at the elementary school, which was sixth grade.  And she came back from summer vacation and had...  She was tall and had big tits.  And that was it, you know?  She was the one.  34D.  First name was Jerry.  Holy fuck.  And she was big.  And I was looking at her tits once and I couldn't stop.  And she kicked me in the nuts.  Just fucking kicked me in the balls.  Boy, she really had a problem with being the only girl with giant tits in there. 
[01:49:00]  There's always one that had to start it off for the rest of the gals.  Ours was just a wreck of her face.  Nasty-ass girl.  Like huge buck teeth and cocky-cock-eyed.  But the biggest boobs we'd ever seen.  She was so popular and so hated all the same.  For us, it was so confusing.  It was like, do I think she's pretty?  Well, we're going to bring her in now, Tom.  Let's get her in here.  Oh, she's a babe now.  We had a girl, 34Ds. 
[01:49:30]  She wore an army t-shirt, no bra.  It drove everyone insane.  Oh, my God.  In school?  Yes, in school.  The power.  Crazy.  The power.  What was she allowed to even come to school?  Who sucked them?  They would just bounce across the cafeteria and we'd all lose our fucking minds.  Did anybody get to suck them?  Suck them?  Unfortunately, I wasn't in that circle.  You know, Google Plus, everyone.  I wasn't in that one.  Wasn't in the tit-sucking circle, unfortunately.  Yeah.  No, she was like, she might as well have been 28. 
[01:50:00]  Really?  She was so unobtainable to most of us.  I think she was already dating college guys as a 15-year-old.  One of those girls.  You know why?  It was so hard to find a place to do anything sexually with girls in school.  Like, where are you going?  Yeah, like when Jimmy said the woods.  Yeah, the woods.  It's like, if you could find some woods, you went for it.  Fucking woods.  Old fields.  I'll go.  Animals.  Animals.  To the woods.  Let's go to the woods.  Me, a tree fork.  Dude, I'll go local.  I'll go local. 
[01:50:30]  Old Fields Junior High, they had that little pond.  I don't know if it's still there.  The Poole de Pond.  And during lunch period, if you were brave, you went and took the walk around the pond  and there was smoking cigarettes, smoking pot, and people making out, which was like  hardcore sex for Junior High.  I got a brace-faced blowjob at Leahy across the street from Old Fields.  Oh, Harborfields.  Yeah.  This is last week.  Harborfields.  Oh, no.  I think Leahy was Harborfields?  Leahy was right across from Harborfields.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[01:51:00]  No, Old Fields had this pond, and the teachers would go back every once in a while, but there  was all sorts of, you know, there was a system set up to make sure everyone knows the teachers  are coming.  I went to Blydenburg Park once, and this was during, like, high school.  Blydenburg Park, and they were having a Girl Scout jamboree thing there, and I knew a couple  of the girls that were Girl Scouts.  So I went into their tent.  I totally snuck in.  Went into their tent, and they're hanging out in their panties and T-shirts.  And I'm in there, and they were, like, playing cards and stuff, and I just thought this was 
[01:51:30]  great.  And then one of the camp fucking head camp leader things were checking on the tents.  I had to lay down in the corner of the tent while these girls, four girls, sat on me to  cover me up and, like, folded their legs.  And I just sat there with four Girl Scouts wearing panties sitting on me.  You like a chair.  It was, I was like, I wish she would never leave.  I would just, this moment would never end. 
[01:52:00]  It was amazing.  You popped your own tent.  Oh.  He did.  Meanwhile, they're in the fucking tent.  They've had little period smells.  Oh, I don't care.  A few dumps that were wiped but not showered.  Oh, who gives a shit?  She always has to ruin it.  That doesn't ruin it.  She ruins it.  It was great.  They always had game, though.  I was staring at underoos.  That is pretty hot.  I'll bet you the counselor came in and saw you and just jerked off to what a lucky devil  you are.  It was a different time. 
[01:52:30]  There were those moments.  We used to go to a cabin upstate, too, with these girls, and it was another place where  you could actually have sex.  Close to the woods.  Yeah, another woods thing.  And it was one of those things, though, where you couldn't sleep.  You didn't want to sleep because that was wasting fucking valuable time of being in  the same bed or sleeping bag with a naked girl.  It was close.  And the second I saw the sky turn that bluish color and you hear birds chirping, I'm like,  fuck, man.  I'm running out.  You're going to have to get up.  This sucks.  I'm running out of time.  Those were the ones you just wanted. 
[01:53:00]  That was it.  Forever.  You could die right there and be completely happy if you were 15 and dead.  And think about that.  That memory is so burned in there.  And all the girls that you've been with since then, you don't even remember.  Oh, those whores.  But those early ones are so potent.  Oh, yeah.  Because you really had to work it.  And it was a new part of your brain opening up.  It was just like, what is this shit?  You never felt that before.  I just had my telescope and science set.  Everything you accomplished, every step forward was just huge. 
[01:53:30]  Huge.  All fodder to tell your friends.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Jeez Louise.  I was getting put to you all the time.  I fuck like 30 girls a year.  Shut up, Chip.  Chip, I'm so green with envy about that.  Sticking it in all the holes.  Getting them creamy down there.  Oh, Chip.  How old, Chip?  How old were you?  One time I was like four, I was getting them creamy and sticking it in.  Climb on and just pound it until it was like Melba toast. 
[01:54:00]  Oh, Chip.  Or those cookies.  It doesn't sound adorable at all.  We should probably break now.  No, Chip doesn't put a good spin on him.  He fucking ruins everything.  I just got a lot of puss.  There's such nice memories until we chirped up.  Were you guys lame when you talked about it, too?  Like, we used to go, did he get patched last night?  Oh, God.  Ew, you said that?  I'm throwing myself under the bus.  Yeah, he blew up pirates.  They wrecked a Robin Williams movie. 
[01:54:30]  We were so fucking lame.  We were the nerds of high school.  Did he get patched last night?  I was getting shit.  So it's like if you got patched, it was a big deal.  And you tell your friends, you got patched.  You were Chip and you didn't even know it.  Oh, God.  I know, I know.  You got lots of patched.  Yeah.  So many patches, you're like a patch factory.  A parrot and a pig leg.  Because it was all about just heavy petting and stuff.  Most of the girls, especially Harborfield, supposedly had the reputation.  They didn't go all the way.  So if you got patched, it was a big fucking deal.  You got patched.  Patched.  I wouldn't have said that at my awful times. 
[01:55:00]  Because if you and my friends blow each other.  You'd be offended by that.  Yeah, patch.  Who's that?  I didn't say it to be cool, obviously.  I'm embarrassed to be like that.  How old were you saying that?  16, probably.  Dirty dancing.  I was a late bloomer.  I didn't mature until my senior year of high school.  Really?  The girls were you didn't come around?  You weren't into girls?  I did well because I, the 10th graders.  Because I was more on their level than I was a senior.  Right.  Girls my own age? 
[01:55:30]  No, fuck no, man.  And no junior high stuff?  A little bit.  I was always like so small for my age.  Right.  I don't think I had pubic hair until I was like 17.  I was a late bloomer.  You were almost 17.  Okay.  Yeah.  It must have been nice and calming to go through junior high and not be losing it yet.  I didn't lose my virginity until I was 18.  I literally last night had a dinner with all these like high school, junior high high school people. 
[01:56:00]  It was like 10 of us.  And we see them every year.  And it's all the girls that we started with.  It's all the first.  It's all the junior high first bra strap.  And we're all.  Who does this?  What's that?  Every year you do this?  Every year we do this around Christmas.  We get together.  Wow, it's crazy.  It's crazy.  And the girls look great.  Come on, really?  I mean, yeah, for 40 they look great.  And all the guys are just like still plotting because it's the first ones that it ever happened to.  It's so potent. 
[01:56:30]  And even if they don't look great to us, it's just like the most amazing.  It's like a model.  We're just all plotting.  How can I get them back?  How can I get them back to the woods?  How can I get them to the woods?  Are there some woods around?  It's things you thought you forgot about.  When I used to still go to high school reunions, you go back and you get right back to the mindset.  And all these memories come back like, oh, yeah, he liked her.  They're still working and this and that.  And you realize you're not really that much older than when you left.  Nah, not really.  Same shit.  Nah, same.  Did your wife go with you and their spouses? 
[01:57:00]  No, no spouses allowed.  Hey.  Oh, that means you guys are.  So it's literally you and your guy friends?  Me and me and me, there's like five guy friends and there's like six girls.  Where do you guys go?  Go to a restaurant and then to a bar.  Last night we just went straight to this bar.  The cemetery.  Hang out and drink beers.  Did your wife get annoyed at that or no?  No, because for her, and partially it's true, is that it's going to be all high school stories.  You don't want to sit and hear about all the good old days.  About bras coming off. 
[01:57:30]  Yeah.  First time you got patch.  It used to be just guys and then all of a sudden the girls heard about it and then they started showing up.  And now it's now.  So this is the plot now and I'll probably blow it.  But in high school we one time rented this beach house.  Like we were all at this beach house somehow.  It was maybe someone's parents or something.  And it was just one of those times where we were all kind of screwing around.  We just lost our minds.  It was like everybody was all of a sudden like making out with people you never even like before. 
[01:58:00]  It was just a playboy mansion.  It was like that.  Literally last night a plan was hatched that we should tell, the guys should tell their wives that they're going on a guys weekend.  The girls go off on a girls weekend.  And we just happen to be in the same house.  Ah.  Don't tell the spouses.  Just go away.  And all of a sudden recreate that thing.  Oh, man.  Yeah, the pictures on Facebook of everyone taking the same kitchen photos.  And the girls would probably go, what?  We're not doing that, you assholes. 
[01:58:30]  I jerked you off in 1978.  Get over it.  You're one of many.  I enjoy having a beer with you.  You just described the plot to the big chill.  It is.  We're trying to replicate it, man.  A couple of the hot ones were into it.  Yeah?  Yeah.  It could happen.  I don't know.  Oh, he just took soon off of the break thing.  That's right.  He wrote, we should break soon.  We got break.  Sam.  And then he goes, we should break.  And then he got rid of soon.  Took the soon off.  Yeah, then it's going to be.  Now, fuckers.  Yeah, then it's going to just be, we should gone. 
[01:59:00]  Tom Piepa, where are you going to be?  Tom Papa live in New York City.  Oh, premieres January 8th on Comedy Central.  Yes.  Comedy Central special.  Very cool, man.  But I'm not.  I'm just hanging in the city for the holidays.  I just want to come and see you guys before we broke.  And the Tom Papa on Twitter.  Tom Papa, I should just say, on Twitter.  Yeah, Tom Papa.  You don't say ad anymore, right?  You just say ad.  Everyone kind of knows.  It's like taking the www off.  Oh, yeah.  Done.  We finally, we only started that last.  Remember the HTTP colon slash slash.  Slash slash.  Oh.  W-W-W-W.  W-W-W.  It's like, what is that?  Let's get to the point.  We were still doing that three months ago. 
[01:59:30]  We finally dropped the W-W-W.  And with some things, you just don't even say .com.  You just go, yeah, Google it.  Yeah.  Or fucking, yeah, it's on Yahoo or something.  Yeah.  Figure it out.  My name's Tom Papa.  Figure it out.  Yeah, figure it out.  When we get back, we got all the great things Kim Jong-il did in his life.  He was an amazing man of action, adventure, and leadership.  Really?  Oh.  Action, adventure.  Sportsman.  From listening to what he's done based on the one channel they get in Korea, North Korea. 
[02:00:00]  What a man.  Really?  Oh, what a man.  I got a list of some of the better ones.  Only to be bested by his son, who's going to be even better.  Ong.  Ong.  Ong.  Ong.  Ong.  Ong.  That's it.  Who's going to be the next leader?  Ong.  Ong.  Don.  Don.  Don.  He in.  Ong.  Ong.  So we'll talk about Kim Jong. 
[02:00:30]  Kim Jong.  So are there other cookies coming in, or these are the only ones we get?  Sorry, sir.  You're stuck with those fucking dry-ass cookies.  That key lime pie is to die for.  Really?  It's going to be like a really overly sweet key lime pie.  Oh, my God.  It looks like it's been hit by something.  Yeah, that was Mars trying to cut it.  And his Puerto Rican knife.  Yeah.  They never know how to make a clean cut, those Puerto Ricans.  I don't know what the key lime pie did to him.  Oh, he was stabbing the knife into it and then twisting the knife.  Sloppy business. 
[02:01:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Dude, chill.  We just want a piece of the pie.  Yeah, come on, man.  Stabbing it and screaming out the name of an old girlfriend.  More with Tom Popper.  Wilding the pie.  Serious XM.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  We have Tom Popper in the studio. 
[02:01:30]  I want to be a dentist.  Sleeves sucks.  I like the sleeves.  Sleeves is a douche. 
[02:02:00]  You should have said that because now we've got to play the sleeves Christmas song for Tom Popper.  I'd love to hear it.  It makes no sense.  It's depressing.  It's not a Christmas song.  Yes, sir.  You're not.  What are you doing?  I'm just prefacing it for Tom.  Well, let him have it over mine.  It's too late.  You're leading the jury.  It doesn't make sense.  You're leading the jury.  Listen to the lyrics.  It doesn't make any sense.  He leaves out parts and just says la la la la when there should be shit in there.  Open mind.  Open mind.  And it's depressing.  It's a funeral dirge. 
[02:02:30]  I think we finally found a classic Christmas song.  Ooh, classic.  Because you don't hear many classic Christmas songs anymore.  No.  We have what we got and nothing new comes out that anyone really grasps onto.  Yeah.  And holds onto for many years.  And I think you can with this one.  Yes.  All right.  Wow.  It's his sleeves and his la la la.  What's the name of the song officially?  Oh, shit.  All right.  Listen to this.  It's a Christmas song.  Turn it up.  I was feeling pretty good for la la la la.  Taking my time on the la la la la.  What does that mean?  It's... 
[02:03:00]  This is merry.  It's got a little knack in culture.  Does it?  This is terrible.  I like to drink a little beer.  At the end of the day.  We're all walking in the town. 
[02:03:30]  We're like a million miles away.  What?  Why?  Uh-huh.  Like a sand above the beach.  The lights walking in the trees.  The people shining in the street.  What?  And the people in the light.  All the children in the light.  In the light?  Singing holy, holy night.  This is so dumb. 
[02:04:00]  We're going to get Tom's opinion.  Are you good?  I feel like I'm going back to bed.  Yeah.  I feel pretty good.  Were you?  Pretty good.  Good.  Taking my time on the la la la la.  Taking his time on the la la la.  What does that mean?  This is stupid.  There's some interpretations there.  No.  It's laziness.  No.  It means just kind of fucking take it slow, man.  I worry so much.  It's a bad songwriting, Petey.  It really is horrible songwriting.  You wrote a bad song, Petey.  It's terrible. 
[02:04:30]  Tom, what do you think of the song?  It, I, it, it.  That's like.  When I heard the little sting before.  Ugh.  With the Jews living there.  I, I thought it, this is funny, but listening to it in context, it's really pretty horrible.  Oh, no.  He was terrible.  This is his serious version.  Yeah.  I mean, he made a goof version about Anthony.  It's like, it's like if he went on.  Oh, this is his serious?  Yeah.  Oh, he meant this.  He meant this.  It's not, it's not, it's not supposed to be funny.  Imagine this.  Imagine this.  Yesterday, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la. 
[02:05:00]  Well, they kind of do that in that song.  No, they don't.  I think they do.  No.  Why she had to go la, la, la, la, la.  It's lazy.  La, la, la, la.  I was feeling pretty good in the la, la, la, la.  Making my way to the la, la, la.  What, LA?  Los Angeles?  At least that makes sense.  Something else, something, and another thing here.  Something that rhymes with la, la, la, la.  Yeah, la, la, la, la, la.  He's going Los Angeles and Louisiana back to back.  Yes.  Just back and forth, back and forth. 
[02:05:30]  La, la, la, la.  What's a terrible?  And another thing.  La, la, la, la, la.  I wish I had some words to sing.  And the people in the street.  And the people that you meet going la, la, la.  What?  You're awful.  And a la, la, la, la.  You don't like?  It's terrible.  This is a Christmas song without any words.  La, la, la, la, la, la.  And something else.  I was writing a Christmas song and a la, la, la, la.  Ran out of words, so I went la, la, la, la. 
[02:06:00]  Have no imagination.  La, la, la, la.  I could fit words in here, but I can't write them.  La, la, la, la.  Bad songwriting, PT.  Trying to sound ironic.  La, la, la, la.  Coming off moronic.  La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.  Running out of time.  La, la, la, la.  And other people on the street.  I just look out the window and write down what I see.  La, la, la, la.  There's somebody putting a garbage can on the street.  La, la, la.  The car is double parked.  La, la, la, la, la. 
[02:06:30]  A guy is beeping.  La, la, la, la.  A bird just shitting my mouth.  La, la, la.  Too bad it wasn't in my ears.  La, la, la.  So, Tommy, like that.  Sam's cookies are concrete.  Sam's cookies are concrete.  I dropped it and it broke both of my feet.  La, la, la, la.  La, la, la, la.  I'd rather eat a piece of street.  My molar came out.  La, la, la, la.  The cats are making duty in the cookies. 
[02:07:00]  La, la, la, la.  My teeth cracked like Vicky LaMotta.  La, la, la.  Mother's pie is too sweet.  Fa, la, la.  Made by a woman with no taste buds.  Fa, la, la, la.  Cottonball cookies.  Fa, la, la, la.  Tasteless shit pieces.  Fa, la, la, la, la.  Just because it's shaped like a tree doesn't mean I have to like it.  Fa, la, la, la.  Should be shaped like a cookie pebble. 
[02:07:30]  Fa, la, la.  Hard dog shit cookie.  Fa, la, la, la.  Like eating dried pine cones.  These would make Santa cry.  Fa, la, la, la.  Fuck, Jonathan just called me.  I didn't pick up on time.  Oh, really?  Fuck.  Fuck, we could talk to him.  He's in West Africa for the holidays.  Oh, there I was.  West Africa.  You know, we got another world traveler on the phone, by the way.  Yeah, Bobby's on hold.  Bobby!  What's up?  Dude. 
[02:08:00]  Hey, Bobby.  Bobby.  Bobby.  Bobby Kelly.  La, la, la, la.  Where are you?  La, la, la, la.  Bet you're eating cookies.  Fa, la, la, la.  Bobby doesn't care if they're dry.  La, la, la, la.  Laying on the beach.  Fa, la, la, la, la.  Tours taking pictures with the la, la, la, la.  Sprinkles on his belly.  Fa, la, la, la.  Look, mommy, it talks.  Fa, la, la, la.  Can I keep it?  Fa, la, la, la.  Can we make lamp oil from him?  Fa, la, la, la. 
[02:08:30]  How much to ride it?  Fa, la, la, la.  It's texting with its flipper.  Fa, la, la, la, la.  And they roll him in the waves.  And they roll him in the waves.  Say, watch his blowhole.  We're calling great peace.  La, la, la, la.  Someone's got to protect him.  La, la, la.  Propeller marks on his back.  Fa, la, la, la, la.  Barnacles on his arm.  Fa, la, la, la, la. 
[02:09:00]  They serve him in sushi, boys.  Illegally, la, la.  Make his love handles into candles.  Fa, la, la, la.  Jonah fell into his mouth.  Fa, la, la, la.  Pinocchio's lost inside him.  Fa, la, la, la.  He thinks he's popular in casinos.  Fa, la, la.  He's mixing up that term.  Fa, la, la, la, la.  Carvel made a bobby cake.  Fa, la, la, la, la.  Every hat is small on him.  Fa, la, la, la. 
[02:09:30]  Funny.  I hope you're killed like Natalie.  Holloway, la, la.  Hope they never find your body.  La, la.  But that's kind of impossible.  Fa, la, la, la.  I can't possibly hide him.  Fa, la, la, la.  He'd be in the ocean.  Fa, la, la, la.  Someone would claim him for their country.  La, la.  Cubans coming to America on top of him.  And Bobby's eating all the krill. 
[02:10:00]  And Bobby's eating all the krill.  He was harpooned by Joran Van der Sloot.  La, la.  Strangest food through his baleen.  Fa, la, la, la, la.  That's a joke for a marine biologist.  Fa, la, la, la.  You know that he's just going to eat until the holidays are over.  Dude, la, la, la.  Ha, la, la, la.  Ah, Bobby.  Thanks for calling, man.  Hey, Bobby.  Ah, wow.  There's Bobby from Aruba, everyone. 
[02:10:30]  Bobby from Aruba.  Check it out.  Bobby.  You know, dude.  Bobby from Aruba.  Thanks for the call.  No, wait.  Do we have...  I've got to plug his gigs at least because he called in.  Oh, God.  That's funny.  I had to dial five country codes.  You know, dude, it's not like I'm down the fucking street.  I want to thank Bobby for calling on our last show of the year.  That was amazing, Bobby.  Oh, it's always a pleasure.  Someone's got to get me Bobby's gigs because he has the Stress Factory.  I think it's the Stress Factory.  New Year's Eve.  7, 3, 2, 5, 4, 5, 4, 2, 4, 2. 
[02:11:00]  Bobby is at the Stress Factory.  Looking at his phone, cursing you.  Well, that was a great call.  Bob Kelly, everyone.  Bobby's at the Stress Factory New Year's Eve week.  Thursday through Saturday there, Jimmy.  Very funny, obviously.  We're teasing Bobby.  29 through the 31st.  Yes, in New Brunswick, a great club.  And he's at the Wilbur Theater in Boston after the New Year.  Whatever.  January.  He gets called away for fucking four straight minutes and then hung up on it.  It's just...  What?  It was a perfect phone call.  This isn't a nice show. 
[02:11:30]  Why?  Texting with his flipper.  This is all horrible.  He's telling his wife, no, I'm going to call the guys.  You know, it's the last show.  Yeah, yeah.  We're kind of like family.  Yeah, they're cool.  You know, I'll plug the gigs.  I'm in a room.  I'll talk about what I've been doing.  Yeah, really?  Wilbur.  Right now, he's walking down that long hotel hallway.  He's just looking at the bad design.  Fucking assholes.  Head to the breakfast buffet.  Fa la la.  Drown your sorrows in a chocolate fondue.  La la.  First one at the continental breakfast.  Fa la la la. 
[02:12:00]  Lucky you're not flying southwest.  La la la.  You'd never be allowed on the aircraft.  La la la.  Operation Bobby Drop.  Fa la la la.  Well, why push her a lug?  It was a perfect phone call.  Yeah, it was perfect.  It was perfect.  I want to try to get when he's at the Wilbur Theater, because I do want to plug his gigs.  Yeah, of course.  I do love that dummy.  Of course.  He's so funny.  Oh, that was funny, Bobby.  Thank you for that.  Wow.  That was a Christmas treat all wrapped up.  All wrapped up and just given to you.  Yes, yeah.  Tom Poppins studio. 
[02:12:30]  Wow.  What a pisser, man.  Poor Bob.  I'm telling Jonathan to call the hotline.  Yeah, we want to.  Yeah, that's a man we want to talk to.  We sure want to talk to Jonathan.  Yes, we do.  Yeah.  Calling from West Africa.  Why'd he go there?  Because he's out of the door.  He goes on vacation like a maniac.  He goes to the worst places, like Somalia.  You don't know why.  I don't know.  Why would he go there?  He's never explained it.  He just wants to try and survive.  He's never explained it in a way where we go, oh, that makes sense.  It's crazy talk.  It's awful. 
[02:13:00]  He's like Commander McBrague.  Remember that cartoon?  There I was, a rhinoceros heading right for me.  I took out my incredibly huge mule.  He's got a big cock, apparently.  Yes, he does.  According to Jimmy's multiple pictures of his groin that he takes.  Oh, really?  I don't know why.  Jimmy just has picture after picture of his cock.  You have to.  His crotch through jeans.  If you're little, you're not taking shots of it.  No, no.  Wow, that was great.  Great phone call from Bob Kelly.  Yeah, go see him at Stress Factory on New Year's.  That's a good New Year's show. 
[02:13:30]  Bobby is great.  We tease him, but he's hilarious.  He's a great club.  He's great.  He's so funny.  He's great.  We love him.  Kim Jong-il.  Do you want some ridiculous things that people believe?  Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na.  You got some of that music for this?  Be better believe.  Believe.  Where are my little shoes?  I was a great reader.  What did he do?  He fucking broke.  He made the country broke.  No.  Starved them out.  Starved them.  Kept them literally in the dark at night and in the dark as far as what's going on in the world. 
[02:14:00]  Well, here you go.  You want to know what he did?  But I guess he has good points.  Kim Jong-il coached the 2010 Korean World Cup soccer team with an invisible phone.  What?  An invisible phone?  Yeah.  They invented the invisible phone?  This is what people believe.  We got to get in there.  In 2004, Kim Jong-il claimed to have invented the hamburger.  This can't be true.  This is true shit.  How did he claim to invent the hamburger?  Well, he kept his people so isolated and starving.  Right. 
[02:14:30]  And then he went to McDonald's and then came back and was like, look what I invented.  Look, I invent this.  Oh, good stuff.  You can't have any.  Is there any American businesses?  Kim Jong-nam?  I don't think so.  Kim Jong-nam, the oldest son, was originally going to replace his father but lost his chance  after a botched attempt to visit Japan's Disneyland.  He ended up in the universe.  Oh, they don't like Japan very much.  I knew.  Yeah.  Dad, I just want to go to Disneyland.  Kim Jong-il once attempted to ship all the short people out of North Korea. 
[02:15:00]  Because it...  Why?  Well, it probably...  He wanted taller people in the country.  It made him look a little...  He was trying to do a Hitler thing.  He was self-conscious.  When we get rid of the shortest people in our culture, then maybe...  He was self-conscious.  Yeah.  I bet he was pissed at the Disney thing because he looks like the small world people.  He really does.  With just different hats on.  It's a world of wrath, a world of fear.  It's a world of hope and a world of fear.  Mostly fear.  What do you mean I'm not tall enough to go on the ride? 
[02:15:30]  Yeah, he must be this high to be a tyrannical dictator.  In 78, Kim Jong-il, kidnapped director.  We learned about this one yesterday.  Shin sang Ah Okay and forced him to make a socialist...  Did you just make a noise or was that a name?  Shin sang Okay.  Oh, you went Ah Ah.  I don't know how to say that.  Yeah.  In my language, it's okay.  It was pretty impressive.  They probably say it differently.  Why didn't he take Spielberg?  Yeah, I don't know.  But they forced him to make a socialist Godzilla film.  We learned about this yesterday.  Come on, it's not a socialist Godzilla film. 
[02:16:00]  I imagine it could be a socialist movie, but...  Yeah.  He routinely shoots three to four hole-in-ones every time he plays golf.  Wow.  Yeah, that's true.  Heavy drinker reportedly spending $800,000 a year on Hennessy Cognac.  Oh.  Tears in his eyes, I guess he winds up this rash shot.  Cinderella boy.  He's powerful.  Oh, he got a rod of that one. 
[02:16:30]  He's going to take this shot.  He's about 150.  I'm going to use about a five iron.  He got a lot of...  It's in the hole.  It's in the hole.  It's in the hole.  It goes on and on.  Dari Rama was quite a gaffer.  What's set on the mitts on him?  Oh, there is one other one that's good.  He wanted to breed giant rabbits to...  Why would he want to make them bleed?  What happened?  See, I'm confused with this language.  I had a hunger problem.  So he goes, look, let's breed giant rabbits. 
[02:17:00]  And then the people can eat giant rabbits.  And I can ride them.  They'll be hopping all over it, all right, Tommy?  Hey, Chippy.  Chipper.  Christmas, Chip.  And finally...  He just sits there with that face on.  I know.  You're frightening.  He was forced to give up cigarettes for health reasons.  So what did he do?  He forced the entire country to do the same.  You'll quit the smoking.  We all smoke.  No smoke.  What a jerk off.  If he couldn't have smokes, the whole country couldn't have smokes. 
[02:17:30]  And you heard of how he was born or something, right?  His birth was foretold by a swallow and heralded by a glorious double rainbow and the appearance  of a new star.  What?  Dumb people they are.  He controlled the weather.  It just goes on and on.  With my weather machine, I rule the world.  I rule the world.  Simon Barr Sinister.  What the fuck is that?  Are they that double dream?  You'll never get me.  I'll make it snow.  Where's my invisible phone?  I love that guy.  He was so great. 
[02:18:00]  He was always trying to rule the world.  Jonathan's phone keeps hanging off.  Oh, is it really?  Maybe he's abducted.  They're giving him one call and someone's fucking it up inside.  He dials the chop off one limb.  You'll make a call.  You'll make a call.  He's saying he tried no answer.  He tried again.  What the fuck?  No answer.  Sam, give them John's number here.  And his biography also says that he doesn't defecate or urinate.  Stop.  I'm serious.  What does he do?  A lot of this shit most people believe in North Korea. 
[02:18:30]  Oh, they believe it.  Yeah.  I don't believe it.  That's true.  They're isolated.  There's no internet in North Korea, I guess.  No.  They're trying to keep all that info out.  I don't know if Kim Jong-un is going to bring in some of this new technology here.  Oh.  Is he going to want to rule with the iron fist like his dad?  Or is he going to want to maybe make his country, you know, get him out there on the world stage  more than just saying we're going to make an atomic bomb and please give us food money?  You think South Korea's going to make a move?  Nah, South Korea ain't going to do shit.  Because they don't want to deal with that shit. 
[02:19:00]  Nuclear weapon.  Only top poverty.  Yeah, South Korea won't do anything.  Right.  Inherit a mess.  Yeah.  It hung up again.  Something's going on with his phone.  Oh, yeah.  I try to go with it here.  I don't know what the fuck's going on.  Who knows?  You can't get a signal out in Africa.  Well, he's calling from his cell phone, too, in the middle of West Africa.  Yeah.  I think that has to...  He's on Ape TNT.  Oh, sorry.  What?  The Congo?  Yeah, the Congo.  Oh.  There's a lot of animals there.  There are.  That's where people go.  Yeah, if you go on safari, you'll see apes and gorillas and zebras. 
[02:19:30]  If they haven't all been killed, Anthony, there's a terrible problem over there.  I'm going to stop buying ask trays.  Oh, there certainly is.  Made of hands.  Hold on.  Yes.  Simon by Zenozo will not fail.  Rule the world.  Was Riff Raff his sidekick?  Was that another one?  I don't remember.  No, Riff Raff was so long ago.  He was different, wasn't he?  Oh.  Was that the guy from Rocky Horror, right?  No, no.  Not that Riff Raff. 
[02:20:00]  No, Riff Raff was like the big square-looking guy.  Yeah, boss.  Not Rocky Horror, you dummies.  I mean, Rocky Horror.  And no, not Jesse Ventura.  No.  Riff Raff.  Oh, they're calling African's phone company T-Cell Mobile because, you know, AIDS.  Oh.  That's so bad.  I don't think we're going to get Johnson.  He keeps hanging up.  That's terrible.  That's too bad.  I hope he's okay.  Riff Raff was the big wolf-looking character. 
[02:20:30]  Yes, thank you, Logan.  Now, what fucking cartoon was he from?  Was he Simon Barsinister's sidekick?  Underdog.  Underdog.  But Underdog was also Simon Barsinister.  Yeah, he was the bad guy.  He would...  Riff Raff.  Help me do...  I think it was like his minion, his...  Riff Raff, are you sure?  I don't know.  He was part of...  Because the Rocky Horror guy comes up. 
[02:21:00]  Yeah, but...  So where's the other Riff Raff?  Underdog.  I know Wally Cox did the voice of Underdog.  I don't see any other...  I like Kaboom.  Remember Kaboom?  Riff Raff was a separate villain?  I don't see any Riff Raffs.  Simon Barsinister was the mad scientist.  Yeah.  Riff Raff is an anthropomorphic wolf gangster based on George Raft.  Right.  His gang consists of Sandy the Safe Cracker, Mooch, Spinny, Wheels... 
[02:21:30]  Cookie the Safe Cracker?  Because they like sand to those cookies.  They're like rocks.  Oh, I thought he was...  He was like the leader of his own gang.  Yeah, he was like that guy who wore like the fucking zoot suit and the hat.  All right.  Riff Raff.  Yeah, Riff Raff.  Boy, cartoons ruled back then.  They really did.  They were...  Come on.  Yeah, they were fun.  Supposedly...  Oh, yeah.  Look at him.  He looked...  Yeah, he was the wolf.  He was a real...  We got him.  Did you see the picture?  Yeah, let me see the picture of this guy. 
[02:22:00]  John?  Remember?  He was like a really sharply dressed gangster wolf.  Jonathan.  Momster.  Jonathan.  Hey, guys.  How are you?  What's up?  Jonathan calling from West Africa.  Yeah, we can hear you.  Yeah.  I'm in the Ivory Coast.  I'm on the road in the middle of nowhere from going north into the country.  Why?  Is it dangerous?  Well, the rebels have... 
[02:22:30]  They joined up with the new president, so everything's cool up here.  I can tell you now.  No, anywhere there's rebels.  I don't care what the rebels have done.  You can't just say everything.  If there are rebels.  You can't just say everything is cool.  Rebels.  He goes, oh, the rebels joined up, so everything's cool now.  Who does this?  Where is your rebel base?  Bum, bum, bum, bum.  Jonathan.  Jonathan, explain.  Like, you're in the middle of nowhere in West Africa during a revolution?  I'm on the road to Popo Jalaso, which is... 
[02:23:00]  It's near...  Love that.  Wasn't that Bing Crosby and Bob Hope?  And they cut off clits all across Africa.  What, Jonathan?  Boop, boop, boop.  Madcap.  Hey, we're going to cut off a clit.  We...  Can you back up when you're going?  We passed.  Okay.  What do you want to know?  I started in a place called Abidjan, which is the capital.  Okay.  Which was...  It's a really big city.  I don't think... 
[02:23:30]  He's in Trent.  He's making these names up.  Yes, I got the picture you sent.  Yeah, this picture's crazy.  So now you're on the road to where?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Popo Jalaso.  Okay.  Which is near...  I just had dinner there the other night.  It's fantastic pasta.  We left Yamasukaru, and that's the capital, even...  But the economic capital is Abidjan, but...  So we were there, and it was like going back in time at this hotel that I stayed at.  It hasn't changed since 1972. 
[02:24:00]  Why would it?  I think the sheets are still from 1972.  Wow, really?  What are you doing?  Don't you have a lot to lose?  Are you going to see the Rockettes or any shows?  I'm here with my friend Shindu.  Yeah?  I'm here with my friend Shindu, who works in the government, and he's showing me that it's...  Mace Windu?  How does he have friends in the government in West Africa? 
[02:24:30]  Explain this shit.  How do you do this?  John, who are those rebels you were talking to?  Who are those four guys with machine guns in this picture?  Well, one of them was a young man.  The youngest guy was the leader, and he got the...  It's a long story, but he was fighting for a long time, and now he's doing pretty good.  Like I said, they joined up the new government, and it's all good.  Oh, it's all good.  Yeah, no, they were actually pretty cool.  I gave him some cigarettes.  They were happy about that. 
[02:25:00]  Yeah, can I ask you, how do you know it's all good?  Just because they said that, or...  Yeah.  What happens when you run out of cigarettes?  Yeah.  I mean, they...  Look, you didn't have to pay any money.  That was a good sign.  And sometimes they ask you for money.  That was...  You know, they didn't search us or anything like that.  And it was good.  This morning, the same thing.  I gave a guy a cigarette, and it's always good to carry cigarettes.  And he was cool.  He right through... 
[02:25:30]  I mean, I'm going through, like...  How many checkpoints have we gone through, Sindhu?  Sindhu.  How many checkpoints now?  Like 33 checkpoints now, yeah.  Have you been to Mos Eisley?  33.  I hear it's a wretched hive of scum and villainy.  Sounds good.  By the way, I had some fish last night that was from a river that was around here that  was really good. 
[02:26:00]  The one thing, though, Jim would hate, hate, hate this for a lot of reasons.  But one, the roads, since they had all these problems beginning in the 90s, the roads got  all messed up because of the rebels.  And there's enormous potholes, potholes where you loot cars.  They're called bomb holes.  Potholes are made by rain and trucks here in the States.  They're bomb holes.  Oversaulting.  Yes.  Yeah.  I guess, yeah.  You're right.  You know what I'm looking at now? 
[02:26:30]  We're literally...  It's a flounder course, but for like six hours, you're gone, and you swerve back and  forth.  Oh, my God.  They're so coercive.  The trucks that come at you are pretty brutal.  That's, yeah.  Yeah.  If you can see what I'm looking at, I'm staring at...  I'm in a village.  What's the village called, can you?  Caciola.  Oh, we're in Caciola.  It means kill the white man in African, Swahili.  What's the good part? 
[02:27:00]  And what's the goal here, Jonathan?  What's the goal when you get to this other city?  We're going to confirm that it's safe in the north, and then, you know, that it's open  for tourism, basically.  You know what's great?  The African Pavilion at Epcot.  I've been there.  That makes you nervous.  Like, three steps away, I'm in Jamaica drinking a Red Stripe.  And still an uneasy feeling.  Yeah, and I'm still a little uneasy.  But do you understand he's going to the city in the north to make sure it's safe? 
[02:27:30]  Why are you doing this?  Like, walking up to anyone, any situation, thinking that it might blow up in your face.  Right, literally.  Yeah.  Hey, John.  John.  John, text me a picture of the road you're on.  You can text me a photo.  Can't text from there?  That's amazing.  No, that is quite amazing to think someone's in Africa can take a picture and just send  it to you.  It really does put a perspective on this that we have these days.  It is a small world, after all.  Let me show you where I am. 
[02:28:00]  Wait, give me one second.  I'm going to take a picture.  Hold on.  It's crazy.  What time is it there, I wonder?  Yeah, what time is it, John?  He's taking a photo.  He snaps the picture, Dustin.  You get the picture.  It's just like a gun barrel in his face.  AK-47.  All right.  So now...  Some guy's blacker than charcoal.  What's that?  All right, hold on.  These guys are really angry that I just took a picture of them.  They would not have...  Well, you stole their souls.  They're holding their fingers at me.  Oh, shit.  Shit.  You're a very bad man. 
[02:28:30]  What guys?  Very bad man.  Uh-oh.  Yeah, this is not good.  What guys?  No, I have to...  Oh, no.  Give him some candy.  Hold on.  Give him some candy.  I love it's either you die or give him candy.  Wait, Andy, it's like children.  Yeah.  It's always those places the youngest one is always the leader.  Yes!  Why does that happen?  I don't understand that.  They lose a lot of leaders.  What happened?  What happened?  All right.  Wait, hold on.  Hold on.  I'm trying to text you guys. 
[02:29:00]  Hang on one sec.  Wait, so now everything's good again?  It's hard to text without fingers.  They just nip them off with pliers.  Oh.  And I have to...  I'll have to hang up to text you, but I'll do it in one sec.  And then, uh...  Would you like to say hi to Sulu?  Okay.  Yeah, sure.  Oh, I love Sulu.  Another underdog character.  Hello.  Hold on.  John, John, John.  Oh, Sulu.  John.  Yeah.  Hello?  Hello.  Hello, Sulu.  Hi.  Is it...  Are you taking good care of Jonathan? 
[02:29:30]  Hello?  Hello.  Yes.  Is it...  Yes, hello.  Hi.  Is it safe where you're going?  Hello?  Yes, hi.  It's safe.  It's safe.  There is no problem.  Ah, no problem.  Is Jonathan taking too many pictures?  Yes.  How do you know Jonathan?  Yeah, how do you know Jonathan?  Hello?  Oh, no.  I had to...  Because we had a...  What? 
[02:30:00]  Yeah.  We must find the location of the honorable base.  Yeah, we...  Everything okay?  I'm glad that didn't go badly.  We were worried that would have went badly with him.  We just asked if you took too many pictures and how he knew you.  Oh, he's gone.  Literally.  Oh, he's going to text now?  He's gone.  There's nothing you could do about it.  He's gone.  I didn't do that.  No, I'm not.  Oh, boy.  What the fuck?  They didn't like him taking pictures.  What kind of vacation is this?  Where you can't take pictures and you're fucking with rebels.  I'd be so nauseous the whole trip.  But, Jimmy, what's this about?  He just loves doing it. 
[02:30:30]  But how does he know all these people?  They love him.  How, though?  How do you network like this?  He knows...  We can't even make friends around here.  He's making friends in these crazy places.  He has connections in every government.  Really?  Every government.  But how?  He can go anywhere in the world.  Did you show Tom the picture of him with the gentleman around him?  Yeah.  Crazy.  He's a rebel.  He can go anywhere in the Middle East.  He knows people.  He knows people everywhere.  Does he work for the CIA?  No, but I've thought that.  I've actually thought that.  He'd make a good one, though.  But he's not.  Is he a spy or something? 
[02:31:00]  No.  He's just very, very endearing.  There's something about him that people love, and he just communicates...  Where is she?  She's back there.  Oh, man.  I can relate with him totally, because I stayed at the Animal Kingdom Hotel in Disney World.  And right out my window, I saw like a giraffe.  It was amazing.  And then you go down, and you feel like you're in Africa.  Except for the people serving you, wearing their Disney tags and clothing.  That's different.  And then you go get a churro and a Pepsi at the vending machine. 
[02:31:30]  Right at the vending machine.  It's wonderful.  I can take as many pictures as I want without anybody saying, I can't take a picture.  What insane...  That kind of travel is just...  I don't understand it.  It's very stressful, I would think.  Yeah.  It's like, I'm going to die!  Yeah.  I was in Beirut once.  Wow.  Okay, that's kind of crazy.  And just going to the airport and going through security to get on the plane, I was like,  they could just completely stop me.  This could all just end in some prison somewhere, rotting. 
[02:32:00]  Yeah, right.  Oh, God.  Very unsettling.  You'll go home now.  You'll go home now.  And they take you out, drive you around the block, and bring you back.  Yeah.  Just to torture you.  What?  You said I go home!  The complete...  You're powerless.  But Johnson doesn't even have a hint of fear.  No, he's not afraid.  No.  He has a million stories, Tom.  He's either really brave or a blithering idiot.  Well, maybe it's us.  I mean, maybe, you know, it's just the unknown.  We look at the world a little too cynical.  Man, we look with a little too much prejudging and hatred in our hearts.  No, they cut people's heads off. 
[02:32:30]  No, they do that.  You literally cut people's heads off.  They cut people's heads off.  I want to steer clear of the vacation spots where they cut people's heads off.  We have to break before...  Yeah, we really should.  We're bringing it up because Ivana's here.  Yes.  Patrice's wife, and we're going to talk about the release of, I guess, what we're...  The Audible stuff.  The CD coming out.  Yes.  All sorts of stuff.  We're going to catch up with her.  A lot of stuff, yeah.  And she wants to say some things, so...  Yes.  We'll talk to...  Why don't you just be to insult all of us in the middle of the game?  No, I'm kidding.  We guys suck. 
[02:33:00]  Baba booing.  You close to the door.  Patrice's girl is next.  Stay there.  Serious.  This is the Opinetry Show.  Show.  Show.  Show.  Show.  Show.  Show.  Show.  Show.  Show.  Show.  Show.  Show.  Show.  Show.  Show.  Show.  Show.  Uh, quickly, people...  Christmassy.  People want to know who Jonathan is.  I thought they knew. 
[02:33:30]  It's, um, Jim Norton's agent.  Yeah.  Manager, I should say, right?  And he likes to travel when he gets his time off to really fucked up places, so there you  go.  Now you know.  It is odd, man.  Oh, where are you?  Go ahead, Tom.  I guess if you manage Norton and his career, going to...  West Africa?  West Africa.  It's pretty easy.  Pretty mellow.  Yeah.  That's like being in the Caribbean to him.  Yeah.  But, uh, I don't know.  Did he text a picture?  I don't...  He was sending it to Jimmy.  All right.  Hopefully...  He called back, but now he's gone again, so I don't know. 
[02:34:00]  But people think he's...  That's...  A lot of our listeners are like, he's a god.  This dude is living life to its fullest.  Jonathan is awesome.  Because they're so tired of people living their life to the fullest.  I know.  Just live it to the...  Mediocre?  Middle.  Yeah.  Just the middle.  Mediocre?  Relax a little.  Yeah.  I like, you know, just sitting on the couch sometimes and playing a little Xbox.  Right.  Exactly.  Well, I'm looking at this picture.  This is Anthony, right?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It's Anthony with a rifle.  You're like almost Jonathan.  You're both...  It's crazy.  See, but unlike him, I would have to take that with me no matter where I went in order to 
[02:34:30]  feel safe and secure.  Looking at a picture of you with a gun.  Yeah, he sent me the same picture that Norton has.  Yeah.  Isn't that crazy?  The gun from the other guys is as big as his whole body.  Yeah, he's got like...  They got AK-47s.  They got little submachine guns.  Yeah.  But they're cool.  But is Jonathan allowed to have a gun or not?  No.  I don't think so.  But Anthony's shot is next to his pool.  Yeah.  Yeah, that shot is...  In Nassau County.  It's a little different.  Little lantern.  I don't see any rebels in Anthony's picture. 
[02:35:00]  That's a range finder.  It's not a lamp that's lighting up the sidewalk to my jacuzzi.  I swear.  Yeah, if the neighbors would have saw me take that shot, it would have...  We're shaking things up a little bit.  Oh, what is he doing?  Jonathan also managed Patrice.  Yeah.  And he would send Patrice these postcards.  Like, every couple of weeks.  And he's like, where the fuck...  He's like, where is he now?  Yeah.  He was always really, really worried about Jonathan.  Now I inherited that.  I'm looking at this picture like, what the fuck? 
[02:35:30]  I know.  What's he doing?  It's not even where is he?  He's like, why is he?  Why?  Yeah, he is over white.  He's too white to be where he is.  He looks so white, especially around them.  I thought my mother was white.  He is white.  They think he's an angel.  They don't think he's a girl.  They're those black guys from like the movies that are so black.  And when they sweat, it looks like a Hershey bar left out in the sun.  They just are like dark black.  Yeah, real black.  And that's usually my thing.  But I was like, get him the fuck out of there. 
[02:36:00]  They're scary guys.  Of course, this is Vaughn.  Yes.  Patrice's girl.  We didn't officially introduce you to the audience out there.  I just started talking.  I'm sorry.  No, that's good, man.  Yeah.  Last time I saw Vaughn was at Caroline's.  We were...  That was fun.  There was some drinking going on, I got to say.  It was.  You know, Patrice and I are always the sober ones at the party.  We don't drink.  And Norton, I know he doesn't drink.  And yeah, it was some action going on there. 
[02:36:30]  You can't say that about me.  You've never been the sober one at the party.  I have no filter sometimes being around Patrice for so many years.  But I don't have his humor or his charm.  And I just say the dumbest shit to people.  And when I was with Anthony, he was talking about a beer that Patrice had once at his house.  And I go, you killed him.  Yeah.  Man, it wasn't just the one beer, I swear.  Damn it.  See, he doesn't do that when I'm around.  You killed him. 
[02:37:00]  I'm sorry.  No, no, it was actually funny.  Yeah, that is Patrice funny.  Yeah, we needed some funny.  Trust me.  And believe me, you do have Patrice's charm.  Yeah.  To be very honest.  And I'm saying that.  Some of it rubbed off service.  That sounds bad.  Some of those rebels where Jonathan is.  Yeah.  What was really cool, though, was seeing your daughter, who, unbelievably influenced by Patrice.  She got up on stage at Caroline's and just started, like, ranting into the microphone. 
[02:37:30]  At Caroline's?  It was hilarious.  Yeah.  I kept telling her no.  I don't know if you guys know Gino Tomac, but he worked with me and Patrice through Big  Mama Productions for years and years and years.  And he kept going, let her get up there.  I'm like, no.  She already spoke.  She spoke at the funeral.  She did really well.  She got up and she's making faces and mugging and body language and smart-ass remarks to  the people.  After we left, obviously.  Yeah, it was after you left.  It was fucking hilarious.  Should we mention that she's 12?  She's 12.  With this personality on her? 
[02:38:00]  That's great.  She's 12.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  She's unbelievable.  She was mugging, making faces.  Stay away.  She's making those disgusted faces.  Like, I was like, holy shit.  Yeah, yeah.  She got into her zone and that was it.  And with encouragement from you guys.  We were all laughing our asses off.  It was great.  It was funny.  I went into this mode.  Like, oh, God, though.  Please stop.  Please stop.  Yeah, she went off, man.  That was funny.  I hope she doesn't become a comic.  It would be awful if she became a comic but was really hacky.  Oh, no.  And Patrice was like, no, don't talk about that. 
[02:38:30]  Don't talk about the McDonald's drive-thru.  It's funny, but don't do it.  I don't know if you guys remember when we did the Patrice O'Neill show coming soon,  the web series.  Yeah.  She was on that.  She was a few years ago, so she was probably like eight or nine at the time.  She was in an episode called Child Labor.  And Patrice directed all of us.  And she was the only one, myself included, who never needed a take-two.  Like, we all sucked.  And she was like, she would get into this zone with Patrice and they would go off to the side. 
[02:39:00]  And the show was mostly improv.  So we wouldn't know what he was directing her to do.  And they would come back and just annihilate all of us.  It was the saddest experience.  Within minutes of meeting her, you could just see the influence there.  It's like, and with someone like Patrice, there's no way you could be around him,  especially during those impressionable years, and not be so influenced.  And it's funny because to hear Patrice talk about her over the years is one thing. 
[02:39:30]  And then to meet her, it's like, oh, yeah, okay, now I see what happened.  Yeah, that was actually, she, a couple of days or the night before the funeral service,  she came to me and she goes, Mommy, I want to speak.  And I'm like, wow.  Really?  Why?  No.  What?  What's going on?  I'm terrified, you know.  And at the height of every emotion you can possibly think of going through all of this, you don't know.  Yeah.  And she goes, no, I think it's important, you know, I don't think a lot of people know how he was with kids. 
[02:40:00]  And I want to speak.  He hid that shit pretty good.  Well, I said, you know, what do you want to say?  Yeah.  You know, it's going to be a lot of people there.  You're not afraid.  She's like, nah.  I said, okay, write down what you want to say.  And then my friend Autumn and I were at the house with my mom and she goes, okay.  Came back in five minutes later.  What you heard is what she wrote.  In like five minutes?  In like five minutes.  That's crazy. 
[02:40:30]  It was so, it was like so heartfelt and, yeah, touching, if I may say.  She almost, she had a moment and then she.  Nah, she fucking, well.  Pulled it back in.  Pulled it, reined it back in.  But when she got to, back to her seat, it was.  Yeah.  What do you think she's going to do in entertainment?  Because she's heading that way, obviously.  Well, she's been a dancer since she was four.  She goes to an arts integrated school now for performing arts.  And she's like, I'm an actress.  I'm a dancer.  She's got something, man.  Yeah.  Patrice actually will always try to encourage me to get her more into stuff now. 
[02:41:00]  But my take on that was, you know, she, I don't want to turn her off from the business.  She has her whole life to really decide if she wants to do it.  Her whole life to realize how much it sucks.  Yeah.  I don't want her to get to 21 and she's done everything.  And then she's like, okay, what now?  Drugs, you know, there's nothing else to do.  So little by little.  And Patrice was always looking out for her.  Like he was trying to, you know, we would write stuff and he would always put parts in 
[02:41:30]  for her, myself.  But he wanted to be the boss, as he would say.  He was very inspired to, you know, he would always say, I'm sick of comedy.  I'm sick of acting.  I just want to be the boss.  And I want to, you know, put people on that wouldn't otherwise have the opportunity.  And, you know, it's, you guys all know how he was.  Oh, yeah.  He had all these different experiences to get to the place where he is now where he's  like, I need to work on my own projects. 
[02:42:00]  The whole Chris Rock thing with the, um, uh, everybody hates Chris.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  He had a revelation when we were doing the Comedy Central pilot, uh, Whitey 101.  And then it was called something else.  Patrice's Guide to White People.  We were doing that.  It didn't get picked up.  How do you not pick that up?  How do you not pick that up?  It's so insane.  Through my experience with him.  Why?  It started out perfect.  It's weird when you go, you really learn a lot. 
[02:42:30]  Where it starts.  And then where it ends up.  That's a completely different thing by the end.  Exactly.  And I think that through his experience, he learned, you know, how he was on other people's  sets.  And he was like, you know what?  I see how I was.  Because there was this one actor that was like the young him.  Like, Mr. Not Happy to Beat or Not.  And Patrice was looking at him like, he's good, but fuck him. 
[02:43:00]  I'm like, shut the fuck up with your opinion on my shit.  You know, so.  He talked about that, actually, and how he's like, I'm an asshole.  He said that he was like, I'm an asshole.  He was like, I'm sorry.  I'll never do that again.  And you know what?  I talked to Michael Clark, the producer of the Untitled Todd Rohall film that's coming  out.  It's premiering next year.  And Patrice is starring in it with Rob Riggle, Johnny Knoxville, Patton Oswalt.  Um, I talked to the producer, Michael Clark, and he, he had a, he was telling me how Patrice 
[02:43:30]  was on the set.  And it was light years away from what you've heard before.  Wow.  Damn.  And I'm like, he was, he said Patrice was very quiet.  He was very, you know, he was asking a lot of questions.  He was observing a lot, but he was very cool and very pleasant to be around.  And I'm like, Oh, wow.  Who's, who's the stand in?  Yeah.  He really liked your set.  You were doing something, right?  And you know what? 
[02:44:00]  He, he would always come home.  Like when he was doing something, if he really didn't want to do it, he, and he said, you  know, I'm not doing anything else.  I don't want to do anymore.  Cause I'm going to burn bridges.  That was part of the revelation.  He's only going to do what he wants to do.  And the untitled, uh, Todd Rohall film was the first thing I think he did that wasn't  his, that he was like, okay, I'll do this.  I'm going to do it.  Other than the, the, the roast, which we all know that story and why he did that for his,  you know, respect for Charlie Sheen and everything for the anti-business stuff, anti-Hollywood. 
[02:44:30]  But he wouldn't come home and complain.  I would go, how was it?  How was set today?  How was it?  He was like, it's good.  It's good.  It's good.  It was good.  And usually that conversation lasts for about three hours and just him going off on assholes  and shitheads and people that don't know shit, don't deserve shit.  Yes, exactly.  Oh my God.  Jonathan said the only thing that bothered him about it was the parking situation.  That was the only thing that annoyed him was the parking and it wasn't anything to do 
[02:45:00]  even the set, which is like, that is a miracle.  And he didn't even really complain about that at home.  So it really didn't bother him much, I guess.  It's so great that he would actually go off about it though.  Like when he was unhappy, like for three hours with you.  To just do it.  Really.  Because if you have a very shitty day, you just kind of get quiet and don't say anything.  You just kind of suck it up.  But for him to actually like really vent.  Well, you never...  Have you met Patrice?  Yeah.  He doesn't really hold anything in.  I mean, many, many years people will ask, what's the difference between Patrice on stage 
[02:45:30]  and Patrice at home?  And it's like, absolutely nothing.  Not one thing.  And you guys know that because you know him so personally.  But there's absolutely no difference between him on stage and him in our living room.  Yeah.  With two people or ten people or a thousand people, he's exactly the same.  He's going to say the same thing.  He's going to have the same mannerisms.  I've never seen him like write anything down.  Yeah.  He has his points that he wants to make and he fucking makes them. 
[02:46:00]  Yeah.  Annoyingly.  Yeah.  You want him to be wrong at some point.  And he's never...  Well, I can say one thing he was wrong about.  Out of the 100%, I take 1% away to say, he would always say to me, nobody cares.  Nobody cares.  Nobody cares.  And I just, I wish he was here to know what's going on and how much everybody cares.  Like, for real.  Like, nobody has disappeared. 
[02:46:30]  There's not enough words for Opie and Anthony and Jim.  People have thought up plenty.  Yes.  Well, I am forever, you know, miss positive words for you guys.  Because, I mean, I've been so humbled through this whole experience.  And it's, I feel like now I have about 10 to 15 husbands with Patrice gone.  I have you guys.  I have Jonathan Branstein, Matt Frost.  Like, I can't even name everybody. 
[02:47:00]  Yeah, we all just hope we have a shot with you now.  You really couldn't have picked the worst crop of husbands.  A bunch of despicable husbands.  A drunk, a tranny lover, and a guy in West Africa.  And all the guys.  Voss, Bobby, Keith.  Kevin Hart.  Russell Peters.  I mean, it's so many people.  I can't even.  I'm not doing any justice.  I got really cold, man.  I do want to say, you mentioned Jonathan and Frosty in there.  They were fucking amazing through this whole thing.  Yeah.  I don't even know if they got enough credit. 
[02:47:30]  Not that we're handing out credit, but those guys were, they showed their true character.  Holy fuck.  I have no words.  Again, there's no words.  From the very, very first day when I called Jonathan, like, help me.  Right.  You know, Patrice is in the hospital.  He had a stroke.  You know, Jonathan, Matt, Norton, the captain of the ship.  You know, everybody has been.  Yeah.  Captain Norton.  Captain. 
[02:48:00]  Captain Norton.  We got Jonathan calling from West Africa.  I just can't.  Oh, boy.  Jonathan.  He was one of your husbands.  Yeah.  My husband.  He's about to be beheaded by a rebel.  Jonathan.  Yeah.  We got Vaughn in studio.  We're here with Vaughn.  Jonathan.  Come home.  Hi, Vaughn.  How are you?  I miss you, and I'm terrified.  Well, don't worry.  I'm okay.  I must tell you, we do have security with us, and he's a really big guy, this guy, and 
[02:48:30]  he wears these satis, but I noticed I don't see a gun on him, but he's got this crazy rope.  Okay?  Oh, Jonathan, the security guy is going to hang you.  It's called the Jew dragon rope.  It's a little too trusting, isn't it?  Will you explain to this quickly why they...  It's going to look like a negative of a lynching.  Okay.  Hello?  Okay.  Hi. 
[02:49:00]  Oh.  Uh-oh.  Yes.  Hi.  Okay.  It's not his phone.  That's his native tongue.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's going to be some clicking.  It's over.  Clicking doesn't go...  During the takeover of Abidjan, it was not his job.  They needed a rope because whenever it was possible to get up for a wall, they had to,  you know, to climb up, you know?  Oh, to climb.  And they also sometimes had to tie some guys, you know, to cook camp.  It was not his job. 
[02:49:30]  So they needed a rope.  Rope.  It's very useful to have a rope with us.  Did you understand that, Jamie?  Yes.  I heard that.  I just want to know if he can answer a question for me.  I heard I inherited $10 million.  I just got to give somebody over there my bank account information.  That's great.  Did you really? 
[02:50:00]  That's great.  So the rope is good for many things.  Climbing, tying people up, and used as a weapon?  Yes.  Can you explain how many people with the rope?  Uh-oh.  Your phone's crapping out, John.  Every other word.  That's what it sounds like when a rope's around your neck.  It's tightening.  Yes.  It all sounded the same to me.  I just, I dangdreamed right through that accent.  I don't know what the fuck he was saying.  Jonathan sounds like he has a hard-on.  This is what fucking gets him off, man. 
[02:50:30]  This is what he loves.  You hear it in his voice.  His last trip, Norton, I don't know if you remember this or know about it, but I don't  know where he was, but he was so mad at Patrice because Patrice laughed at him and said, good  for you, because he was somewhere eating some kind of fucked up weird food and got food  poisoned.  Oh, yeah.  And he was sick.  And that's got to be crazy food poisoning.  And Patrice was just like, good for you.  He was like calling Patrice in the middle of the night.  I'm probably telling this story all wrong, but this is the gist of it.  Yeah.  And he was sick as a dog and Patrice was laughing his ass. 
[02:51:00]  Where was he?  When you get Africa food poisoning or, you know.  It was Russia.  It was the old Russia, right?  Was it like one of those old...  I don't know.  He ate like monkey brain or something.  Something weird shit.  Yeah.  After they broke down Russia, he was one of the stands.  Yeah.  It was recently, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think it was the trip before all of this went down.  Right.  Yeah.  Well, he was...  Jonathan's postcards, by the way, you always get after he's been back in the office for  two weeks.  Like literally, I'll see him and get a dumb postcard from him. 
[02:51:30]  It's like, when did you say that?  He's like, about three weeks ago.  Yeah.  He's always in these countries that the postal system is fucking horrible.  They don't have great infrastructure.  How often does he go?  Constantly.  Constantly.  You know what it's like to be working on a special and go, where's my manager?  Oh, he's in fucking Bali.  He's in Islamabad.  I think is where he was.  Oh, that's a nice place.  He'll be screaming at his phone like, I can't because my manager's in fucking a blah, blah,  blah, blah place.  Yeah.  I was livid the last time he went away.  We're negotiating something and he just went without telling anybody. 
[02:52:00]  And I'm like, what a fucking...  I feel like a chick that he just fucked and snuck out in the middle of the night.  How does he get so much time off?  I don't know.  Like, because he's got too many...  His passport's got to be sane.  Yeah, his passport's got to look like, you're up to something.  Right.  No one just does this.  I don't know how he gets off.  I think he runs the passport place, whatever that is.  Yeah, there's something going on.  No, he's got a little side job.  There's something else happening.  Fuck yeah.  That's probably he's smuggling in the front of his pants with his big bulge.  It's probably a missile weaponry or something.  Do you know how many times he must get searched in customs?  What is that? 
[02:52:30]  Yes.  What are you smuggling?  Fuck.  Holy shit.  That's a fruit.  He's a mad man.  It's our last show of the year.  We got to talk about the CD and all sorts of shit.  Make sure we get all that info out there, Vaughn.  Mr. P, thanks to everybody who already bought it on pre-order.  And I don't know.  Obviously, thank you guys.  But whoever else at Sirius who pulled this audible thing off is like.  Yeah, that's just some of the right thing.  I'm so floored and humbled.  I wish I was more articulate and had better words. 
[02:53:00]  I'm amazed because I have a horrible overview of humanity.  And I've seen some good shit happen during an adverse circumstance.  So I'm actually amazed.  And you know what?  You and Patrice are pretty much almost the same person.  I think that's been said before.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Just different colors.  Yeah, different colors.  I think Anthony is more black than what he wants to admit.  Yeah, that's Sicilian.  You know, the moors.  He does all the black stuff.  He says all the black things.  Got the Escalade.  I like guns. 
[02:53:30]  You really are.  I don't like working.  He just doesn't like big girls, you know?  That's true.  I would have to lose like 40 pounds to be white and to be acceptable.  That's too bad.  White Anthony is acceptable.  I do like a skinny bitch.  I don't know if you remember this, but years and years ago, I came to that bar, the Irish place.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  We were hanging out.  Yeah.  And you were just breaking up or something.  And Patrice is like, sit on his lap.  And I sat on Anthony's lap.  And I'm like, I better not put all my weight down. 
[02:54:00]  I'm pretty sure he doesn't want me to sit on his lap.  That was so uncomfortable and so hot at the same time.  Because Patrice was being a good guy.  I was like, yeah, I broke up.  And Patrice had the best line with that.  He goes, yeah, I'm breaking up with my chick.  He goes, does that mean when I see you, I don't have to talk to her or nothing?  Yes.  It was like, yeah, okay.  And he didn't mean it.  Of course he did.  And then he was like, you know, yeah, I'll sit on his lap.  And she'd sit on my lap and I was just kind of like, yeah.  But I had enough in me where I was comfortable putting my hand on your leg. 
[02:54:30]  Was it weird touching legs that actually reached the floor?  I'm so used to them swimming in a bunkled shoe.  Instinctively, he puts you over his shoulders on a pat on your back.  By the way, now people think that Vaughn is fat or something.  She's ridiculous.  She's very hot.  But not in.  No, you're not.  No, she's ridiculously in good shape.  Buxom. 
[02:55:00]  Buxom.  Buxom is a good word.  That sounds like a really, really fat black girl.  No.  A fat black girl is called fat.  Okay, I'll take it.  I'm half white and half black.  I'll take it.  We all knew Patrice was batting out of his league.  We would say, oh, what the fuck did he pull off?  What the fuck is he doing here?  Who isn't?  I don't know anyone that isn't.  Everyone in this business.  Sam, stop it.  Yeah.  He would say that all the time.  I'm out of his league.  I'm like, yeah, okay.  Have you seen his previous girlfriends?  Well, some of them. 
[02:55:30]  Some of them are really attractive, but you're the best of all of them.  Oh, you're just saying.  No, I'm not.  I wouldn't tell you if you weren't.  I wouldn't be mean.  No, I just want you to keep saying it.  But it's true.  It really is true.  You honestly are.  I'm efficient.  I knew one.  I met one.  I saw photos of one.  Disaster.  Really?  Disaster.  Oh, really?  Oh, really?  Yeah, and I don't want to say her name, but you know who she is.  He didn't bring her around much?  No, well, I don't even know if she moved down.  Uh-oh.  He's writing.  No, no, Vi will know who I mean.  Oof.  Oof. 
[02:56:00]  And then the girl from England was okay.  She was okay.  Okay.  Nothing, nothing, you know, memorable.  I mean, she was cute, but average at best.  Not even.  So, kill all of them.  How's Patrice's mama doing?  Yeah, how is she?  I think she's doing pretty good.  Yeah?  Yeah.  She was cool as hell, man.  That's cool.  She called me, and I felt bad I haven't called her.  Like, I texted her back.  It's like, I don't listen to my voicemail.  Yeah.  Like, I literally get a message a week later.  I don't see my voicemails.  And I'm like, oh, God, I hope she doesn't think I fucking blew her off. 
[02:56:30]  Yeah.  Like, I'm too busy.  No, I think, you know, everybody's just trying to, you know.  Look at this.  All these fucking messages.  Yeah, yeah.  It's, it's, and it's not just us, you know.  It's his friends.  Yeah, it's still a daily thing.  It's the weirdest thing.  It's like, people were so connected to him.  And, and.  And that never even met him.  Everybody lost.  Everybody lost.  People that never met him in person.  Yeah.  Were devastated.  I was reading so many tweets and stuff from fans of the show that are like, man, from 
[02:57:00]  listening to him so many times on the show for so many years, it's like, I knew, you know,  I didn't know this guy personally, but I knew what he was about enough to, like, be pretty  broken up about it.  Even the haters chilled the fuck out.  They just went away for a while.  I was like, wow, that, that.  There was one email that really got to me.  It was a guy, I forget the exact ages, but he was saying, you know, he had been watching  Patrice since the early days of Tough Crowd.  And that was like 10 years ago.  And he's like, I'm 20 something now, like 25. 
[02:57:30]  He's like, you were the only father I ever had.  Holy shit.  Your comedy and your philosophies on life have pretty much raised me and you don't even know.  Oh, wow.  Wow.  And I'm like reading this like, huh?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Huh.  Yeah.  How do you even fucking wrap your mind around that one?  Yeah.  You don't.  And it's, it's, it's like we all lost so much.  I'm, I'm not going to ever be selfish with my pain.  It's, it's a lot of people's pain and, and my daughter, I will say this about her, the 
[02:58:00]  most mature special kid, not just my kid, but she, she was the only one, myself included,  who had a complete meltdown specifically about feeling bad that for Patrice, that Patrice lost  his life, that Patrice couldn't be here to do the things that he wants to do.  You know, we were also wrapped up in what we're losing as a lover, as a husband, as a  friend, as a, uh, everything he is to everybody else. 
[02:58:30]  And she was like, no, I, I'm going to miss him, but what about him?  Wow.  He doesn't get to finish.  She said, it's, it's not fair.  He doesn't get to finish all these things that he wanted to do.  And most of the, these things that he wanted to do was for all of us.  Yeah.  It's just not right.  There's adults that don't have that perspective.  No.  No.  She gets that from him because I don't get.  I don't even think that all I think of is he owed me 50 bucks. 
[02:59:00]  Hey, uh, one other thing, Vaughn, I know when you, you said you were coming in, you  wanted to like talk about his health because some, some weird things were said.  Oh, thank you for reminding me.  Just so, so everything's on the record, man.  Okay.  I was not getting bothered, but I know a lot of people have this perspective that, oh,  he, he didn't take care of himself and, oh, he had to keep drinking grape soda or  whatever and steaks or whatever the perspective is that he wasn't taking care of 
[02:59:30]  himself and, you know, that's why this happened.  The stroke that he had could have happened to anyone, even the healthiest person.  Was it probably because of diabetes and high blood pressure and all that is weight.  Sure.  Who knows?  I don't know, but I will say this.  We went to the hospital and I think it was oh five for his high blood pressure and he was  in the hospital probably for two or three days and from that point, he had been very, 
[03:00:00]  very serious about getting his diet together and taking his medicine and I was a fucking  annoying asshole, you know, always asking him about medicine and we were actually vegans.  His idea.  We were vegans for two years straight.  Wow.  He was not just guzzling Guinness or grape soda or just eating cakes. 
[03:00:30]  If he wanted something, he would bring home cookies with like no sugar.  They were awful.  But that like those.  Yeah.  I never saw me.  I never saw me.  No.  And we always have fucking food around his joint.  He was really doing well, but I look at it like, you know, the if you smoke for 30 years  and then you quit for five to 10 and then you die of lung cancer, then, you know, what 
[03:01:00]  could you have done?  But he certainly tried and I just didn't want people looking at him like he didn't try.  He didn't give a fuck.  And that's so not true because I lived through all of that with him.  You know, I've been with him almost a decade.  You know, so it's very, very different how he was in the beginning to now.  So I just thank you for reminding me.  No worries.  Yeah.  You could tell he was he was always, you know, concerned about it.  Yeah.  I never saw him talk about it.  He never ate.  You know, he wasn't sitting here just throwing eggs and bacon in his face when we were doing 
[03:01:30]  the show.  He got me off the aspartame.  I literally I was so annoyed that he kept talking about aspartame.  And I'm like, oh, and then fucking Glenn Beck talked about it.  I'm like, son of a bitch.  And I am obsessed now with not fucking with aspartame.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But he put that bug in my head.  He wouldn't eat these hard cookies.  That's for sure.  Yeah.  No, they're terrible.  No, he would actually.  Sam's mother's Christmas cookies are horrid.  Do you want to try one?  Don't.  Don't.  Try homemade.  Don't homemade.  Don't homemade.  You got to. 
[03:02:00]  Hasn't she been through enough?  Stop with the cookies.  Just try one.  Please.  Just tell us if it's dry.  We've all.  I mean, like, eight.  Oh, don't.  Which is.  If they were good, I would eat in 30.  You don't want to lose a tooth.  I'm not good with peer pressure.  I'm not going to do it.  Don't.  I want to know if it's good.  Oh, you're going to lose a tooth at all your holiday pictures of you with no tea.  Yeah.  You don't want.  You don't want that.  Holiday pictures.  Oh, it's the holidays.  My bad.  I didn't know.  Tom.  Jesus.  It's the holidays. 
[03:02:30]  See, there I go again.  I just say, like, random blurt, dumb shout.  No, but you're right.  I'm sorry.  No, I know.  I forgot.  I have a feeling she's not celebrating Christmas this year.  I know.  Maybe next year.  But she seems so positive.  Piss your ass, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  How am I going to, you know, honestly, I don't want to be Debbie Downer.  I'm trying to be positive.  But how am I going to celebrate Thanksgiving and Christmas and his birthday is, you know, it's  like, everything is back to back and it all happened around this time. 
[03:03:00]  So I'm like, yeah, well, yeah, fuck the holidays.  Just wait until New Year's and 2012.  New Year's.  I spend New Year's every year with him.  Yeah.  So I'm like, hmm, New Year's.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Second one may be a little bit easier because you'll have one year without it already to  go, okay, this is what I did last year.  I like it or didn't like it.  At least you'll have one behind you.  So everyone, it gets a little bit, not to say easier, but at least a little bit more  tolerable just to experience.  The first year is brutal. 
[03:03:30]  I've been up under him for, I mean, you guys know how we were together.  Oh, yeah.  I've just been up under him for so long.  It's like, I'm trying to, I got to pick up my face off the floor, literally.  Like, he was a part of every aspect of my life.  Yeah.  Except my own personal health and, like, whatever beliefs I have in God.  But, you know, love, friendship, romance, fun things to do, career.  He was a part of everything.  Family is, so I got to figure everything out. 
[03:04:00]  And he used to always tease me and go, you know, get your own personality, bitch.  And I'm like, all right, yours is better.  Just tell me what to do.  Personality, bitch.  Holy shit, man.  So now I'm just trying to, I guess my purpose now is to just try my best to keep his voice  alive in any way I can, in the most appropriate way possible.  And I can't thank you guys enough for helping me to do that. 
[03:04:30]  How did they get to Audible again, Jimmy?  Audible.com.  Slash Patrice.  Slash Patrice.  Oh, just Patrice?  Yeah.  And the company did the right thing.  Yeah, we're not getting any money.  The company's not getting any money.  No money.  And they don't like parting with money at all.  The fact that Sirius gave up the money, if you understood the miracle that is, they're  going to come to you someday and go, look, we fucked up.  I was about to ask who's the dick am I supposed to suck?  We fucked up.  Come on.  Come on.  This is the...  I got to go.  There's Captain Jim.  Jimmy will take one for the team. 
[03:05:00]  Oh, my God.  You know we owe them.  Somehow they'll twist this down the road.  We do owe them, actually, yeah.  Somehow they'll twist this fucking thing during negotiations or something.  But, yeah, the company did the right thing.  They did do the right thing.  It's audible.com slash Patrice.  16 hours, $5 per four-hour segment.  Per four-hour block.  So you get the whole thing for $20.  It's amazing.  And the money's going toward Patrice's loved ones.  That's a lot of material.  Yeah.  That's a lot.  There's a lot of material on Patrice.  It is.  And it's not stand-up.  It's not stand-up.  Right.  It's fucking improv.  It's life's fucking philosophy. 
[03:05:30]  I think one of the segments was charting yesterday, even.  Oh, really?  Oh, fuck yeah.  People were buying it yesterday.  That's great.  It's in the top ten downloads for Audible right now.  Good.  Top ten downloads.  That's amazing.  That's great.  And then you got Mr. P coming out.  February 7th.  I heard the CD.  It's fucking amazing.  Yeah.  It's amazing.  It's really weird to listen to now because I...  It was tough to listen to.  If we have time, a little background on the CD.  We were working on that. 
[03:06:00]  We, like I helped with material or something, but he recorded like three or four shows in  D.C.  And he loved D.C. and he loved San Francisco.  And it was between the two that recorded the CD.  And he ended up in D.C.  And he had me listen, which was normal to like all four, three or four shows.  And then I give him my notes and he shoots the notes off to Jason Riggs, who's the producer  and the record label owner, if that's how you say it. 
[03:06:30]  And it was weird because when all of this happened, I think Jason was really comfortable  with working with me because he's like, well, I have your notes.  And, you know, Patrice already approved which show he wanted.  And I remember that.  But the one thing that we didn't do was the cover.  He wanted to...  He described exactly how he wanted the cover.  But we never got around to shooting it.  So what happened was, you know, worked with Coke Logic on... 
[03:07:00]  We got the picture.  That piece of shit.  Yeah.  He did a great job, though.  Yes, he did.  If you see the Mr. P.  It really is.  I feel like Patrice would have liked that cover.  It looks amazing.  I just feel like he would have said, absolutely, this would have worked.  That's exactly...  He said, I want to be in Times Square.  I want people around me, but I want them blurred.  It's going to be hard to get people not to look if you're taking a picture.  But I don't want them looking at me. 
[03:07:30]  And I either want to be on my phone or looking at my watch.  And I found a picture of him looking at his watch.  And then they helped me find the Times Square's picture of the people and blurred it.  And we got it as close to...  I think he would have also...  It's amazing, yeah.  I like it.  I like it a lot.  Yeah, that almost life moving quickly around him.  And he's just kind of standing there.  And it's almost like...  He's doing it on his time.  Right, right.  That's great, man.  If you know Patrice, you get it. 
[03:08:00]  I'm doing things on my time.  I was watching some Elephant in the Room.  And I went when he taped briefly, but he was already on stage, I think, when I got there.  It's like, you don't watch your peers.  I don't watch other acts.  You just don't do it.  I don't.  Because I don't want to be influenced by them.  And I don't want to get depressed seeing how good they are.  And I watched some of Elephant in the Room.  And I haven't seen the whole thing recently.  And I was miserable and sad.  And it made me laugh out loud alone.  I'm literally...  I'm not exaggerating.  I laughed out loud alone in my apartment.  And I'm grieving my friend who's dead. 
[03:08:30]  And I'm laughing out loud.  I'm fucking amazing.  It's like, God damn, it's a fucking good, man.  So good.  And then there's a part of me as depressed as it is.  And it's horrible.  I'm like, you know what?  I got to work with him for almost, what, fucking 15 or 16 years.  I got to be a fucking peer of him and to see him work.  And it's like, you know, a lot of guys die a lot.  Like, Bill Hicks died at 33.  And it's like, it's never good.  But I had a lot of time with him.  And I got to watch him do a lot of things.  And I go back and watch those tough crowds.  And I'm like, I'm so happy I was on that show with him. 
[03:09:00]  I was so happy that I got to see him yell at Colin like that and fucking, and totally dominate the show where I would try to say something I couldn't.  I was like, what the fuck?  Dominate the show.  But it was like, I'd love to be able to go back and watch this.  That stuff that's on Audible is so cool because, like you said, it's not stand-up.  It's just him in here bullshitting about things.  And that's the thing.  Completely unfiltered.  Being selfish about your feelings and what you miss.  It's like, those conversations and discussions and sometimes arguments we would have were just like, I can't ever have those with anybody else. 
[03:09:30]  That is just me and him having those conversations.  And then I think of it as those cartoon characters, the wolf and the sheepdog.  And then they just punch out at the end of the day after just trying to kill each other.  And then we'd walk down to the parking lot and you'd just be like, yeah, what you doing tonight?  See you tomorrow.  How's that pool?  And it was like, you know, we were just back and forth.  No, you idiot.  What are you talking about? 
[03:10:00]  And that's something that just I can't imagine anyone else sitting down and having that kind of rapport with.  The only way you could make a point with Patrice is like, if you went head on, you were going to lose.  Because he would just make an out.  Oh, yeah.  The best way to do it was you had to acknowledge a point.  You had to give it a little bit.  You know what?  That's a good point.  And then when you had him thinking, then you could hit him with a jab.  And when he's waiting for his next compliment, you kind of come around the side.  It really was like boxing.  Yeah, you had to rope a dope a little bit.  If you just stood there, you'd get your fucking teeth knocked out. 
[03:10:30]  But if you got him, he would say, fair enough.  Yeah.  He would consider everything.  He was fair.  Out of nowhere, because he could be completely disagreeing with what you're saying.  You make a point.  He'd sit back.  He'd put his finger up and go, yes.  And you'd go like, what the?  Wait a minute.  Wait, wait, wait.  Wait, wait, wait.  Record.  Record.  Say it again.  Say it again.  Say it again.  I think in the almost 10 years I've known him, I got a fair enough from him maybe once. 
[03:11:00]  All right.  And I cannot for the life of me tell you what it was for.  Because I was so in awe.  Well, you got it.  Like, huh?  What?  No.  It shocked you.  I'm still shocked.  The racial discussions were the best with him because they were always honest.  And it was like, it was.  And he had such a different take on it.  You know?  It wasn't just the company line of a white guy or a black guy or a white guy and a black guy talking.  It was just, this is Patrice and this is how he feels.  You know?  He clarified every point. 
[03:11:30]  So even if you didn't agree with it, you knew exactly where it came from, why he felt that way, the logical progression to the point.  He had great examples.  You always knew why.  And so you couldn't just write it off as ah and dismiss it.  Great analogies.  That's exactly where that comes from.  That's why you could rarely win an argument with him on any level because he would so, everything was so well thought out.  It's like, I would never think that far into anything.  It's like, he thinks of 50 questions or questions and answers if you're going to think of five or ten if you're the average person. 
[03:12:00]  I think of maybe one or two and I'm like, what?  Okay.  Okay.  I don't care.  The Audible is 7, 8, 9, and 10 right now.  The four segments.  7, 8, 9, and 10.  That's great.  7, 8, 9, and 10.  Oh, great.  Probably move up a little more today.  Audible.com slash Patrice once again.  I wish they would have sold Tough Crowd.  I wish that would have made it to a DVD.  Yeah.  Because the Daily Show, they just never did it.  Yeah, so do I.  Well, you know.  Well, you're quiet. 
[03:12:30]  They didn't fucking want to do that.  He writes his finger.  I'm glad Colin and Patrice cleared up whatever that was.  Yes.  Yeah, but that came out of nowhere.  That was like the last time we saw Patrice on the radio.  The weirdest things happen leading up to those few days.  And, you know, as time passes and I come back again, we'll talk about more.  But so many weird things happen leading up.  Sometimes I don't want to get all spiritual and weird, but sometimes they say, you know. 
[03:13:00]  You know.  You know.  You're like you're inside.  Somewhere inside you know.  Yeah, knows.  And that Colin is the closest thing I think Patrice ever had as far as a he would always talk about never having a mentor.  And I think he really, really looked up to Colin in a lot of ways.  And those two together are just anytime they were together is just annoying because they would never acknowledge their man love. 
[03:13:30]  Last time I saw Colin with Patrice was when we were leaving from the Jay Moore podcast and Colin was up next and we were leaving out.  And Patrice goes, oh, Colin, my girl loves you.  My girl loves you.  Take a picture.  Take a picture.  So in my head, I'm like, this means he loves you, Colin.  This means he wants a picture.  And if you look at my Twitter, at Von DiCarlo, the pictures of those last pictures are up. 
[03:14:00]  I tweeted them that day.  Me and Colin and then Colin and Patrice.  And that was the thought.  It was like, here we go again.  Every time we see Colin, it's like, oh, my girl loves you.  My girl loves you.  They're man love.  Holy shit.  They're man love.  I think he has special man love with all of you.  They had a fun dynamic, though.  It was like, because they're both very headstrong guys.  Colin's very stubborn sometimes.  There's times where Colin's irrational.  You know what I mean?  And fucking, I knew that whole thing that happened between them. 
[03:14:30]  And I saw both of their sides.  Yeah, I thought Patrice should have backed off a little bit.  And I thought Colin should have realized he was just kidding.  It was like, you know, two friends butting heads.  But it was there for a while, even though they made up.  I was happy they spoke about it.  Yeah, yeah.  I think he was, too.  Yeah.  I know he was.  Oh, yeah.  That shit always makes you feel better.  You know, it's just one less thing you got to fucking deal with.  And Colin knows it, too, which is better that he knows that they spoke about it.  So he doesn't have to.  Oh, fuck Colin.  Well, yeah, completely.  He describes him so well.  When he said at the service that Patrice was probably in heaven trying to talk to God as an equal. 
[03:15:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That was so fucking good, man.  How can you describe him any more accurately?  Yeah.  He really was.  Colin really is the greatest profiler.  I think that's what we all agreed on.  He personality profiles.  Oh, yeah.  And relationship, like, meaning the interaction between two people so immediately.  Oh, yeah.  Were you at Bobby's, like, surprise party a few years ago? 
[03:15:30]  That small dinner?  Yeah, downstairs.  Well, when we got there, I don't know what Patrice was yelling at me for that day on the way in.  I'm sure I did something, like, talk too much for more than two seconds.  And when we got there, he was saying something to Colin.  And I know what it was.  He says, I repeat myself over and over as if I didn't, as if he didn't fucking hear me the first time I say it too many times.  And when we get there, he's like, yeah, Colin.  And he's telling Colin the story about our drive into the city. 
[03:16:00]  And Colin folds his arms.  He goes, yeah.  And how do you think she feels when you say your shit for the fourth and fifth and sixth time?  You think she wants to hear that shit?  Oh, man.  I do love you, Colin.  Because Patrice repeats himself, too.  But he thinks, you know, he would tell me, well, that's because you don't get it.  And, you know, a lot of times he was right.  But on the other hand, it is true.  It's like, well, you're not listening. 
[03:16:30]  That's why I repeat myself.  Well, no.  I repeat myself because I'm not sure if I said it right the first time.  He knew that.  And he just wanted me to shut the fuck up.  Just shut the fuck up.  Like I said, he was mostly right all the time.  Oh, man.  We all like to hear ourselves talk.  I know I do.  That's why I just jumped in.  I have nothing to say there.  What a fool.  But it was too much time without Jim Norton.  That hurts the ratings.  Good boy.  Good boy, Jimmy.  Give me that dose of Jimmy. 
[03:17:00]  Gold star Jimmy.  We have to plug everything.  Yeah, let's get the fuck out of here.  Before we wrap up, for the end of the year, let's wrap up.  A couple of things I want to plug.  Bob Kelly, New Year's Eve, The Stress Factory.  And he will be at the Wilbur Theater in Boston.  Yes.  And I just keep forgetting.  I'm looking at my phone because he texted me.  He's like, what the fuck, dude?  That was the funniest song.  That was a great phone call.  That was a great.  I want to thank Robert for calling.  January 7th, WilburTheater.com up in Boston. 
[03:17:30]  Yeah.  So if you're from Boston, go up and see Bobby.  He's great.  Yeah.  And of course.  What is Jonathan promoting?  Jonathan.  The government takeover in North Africa.  He was pitching a cartoon about clitoral circumcision.  Oh, good.  He's plugging that.  Yes.  In the car.  God, I hope he comes home.  Alive.  Alive.  I guess he will come home no matter what, but hopefully alive.  And.  He's crazy.  And audible.com slash Patrice.  Patrice.  For the 20 hours, 16 hours for 20 bucks, or you can just buy, if you're a chiseler, buy  it in sections.  Patrice. 
[03:18:00]  Fucking assholes.  Get the whole thing.  Buy it all.  Buy it all.  Because a lot of people ask, what could they do?  This is something you can do if you have the money.  It's going toward a great cause, obviously.  Yeah, so it's Patrice's family.  Everyone that Patrice loved.  And also great content.  And Mr. P, there's the CD, which obviously not released yet.  You can pre-order iTunes and on Amazon.  And then, and Jason and those guys did the right thing because they actually switched  the deal so the family got more money.  I mean, they did a good, they were really.  A lot of people stepped up, man.  A lot of people.  Stepped up.  Amazing, yeah.  And if I can, I forgot to mention, and I'm probably a ton of people, but thank you to 
[03:18:30]  Dr. Steve, too.  Oh, yeah.  He sends a text.  He's.  He's great.  No words.  Dr. Steve.  Yeah, he's creepy.  I think that's the word you're looking for.  He's creepy.  You know, I.  That's one word.  Yeah.  That's how I would describe all of my new husbands.  The cookies have, cookies have no fluid in them.  That's why they're dry.  They could use more fluid.  Yeah.  You could probably eat those and you're going to get diverticulitis. 
[03:19:00]  Von, Twitter again is Von DeCarlo.  Yeah, V-O-N-D-E-C-A-R-L-O.  Just V-O-N.  Okay.  Yeah.  Say hi.  Nice.  Yeah, say hi.  What are you releasing?  Oh, my humble little project.  Actually, Patrice's co-executive produced my album project.  I wrote the music for Elephant in a Room, and then after that, I was working on my own  album project, and a couple days, actually, before he had the stroke, he actually hired  a publicist to try and help me, you know, promote it and everything. 
[03:19:30]  He was very supportive, and it was quietly released on his birthday.  Yeah, it was scheduled for that day anyway, and I was going to do this big album release  party and disguise it, because I really wanted to have a birthday party for him, but I didn't  get to do that.  But anyway, but I would say that I'm still here to do another album if my project doesn't  do well.  So if you got 10 bucks to spend on my album, change it over and spend it on Mr. P or Audible 
[03:20:00]  or, you know, my purpose is to keep his voice alive as much as I can.  I'm still here.  Like I said, if my project doesn't do well, A, I could do another one.  He's not here to do another one, and I want to make sure that his voice stays out as much  as possible.  Oh, absolutely.  What is the name of your album?  Where can you get it?  Oh, Honest Righteousness is on, actually, Honest Righteousness I wrote is the title track, 
[03:20:30]  and the video is out.  I posted a link to my YouTube on my Twitter earlier, and that's the song I wrote about  Patrice, and he actually called it the stalker song.  Put it in the most simplistic terms, yeah.  I wrote about my honest feelings for him, and he would always say, be honest, be righteous,  and, you know, I wrote a song about it, and then he called me a stalker.  That's terrible.  That's so typical.  But exactly.  But thanks for even mentioning it.  I really want to, you know, make sure that his stuff is... 
[03:21:00]  See, that's three.  I repeat it myself.  All good.  That's okay.  Don't worry.  I would never want a woman to write a song about me because nobody wants to hear a song  called Erection Difficulties.  You can't make me cum, dum-dum.  The anti-stalker song.  Oh, the awful.  The running away.  The why I'm leaving song.  But if you go to my website, there's links for my stuff, Patrice's stuff.  For everything. 
[03:21:30]  Oh, yeah, Twitter.  I also have always ran Patrice's Facebook, and sometimes I would post it.  I would post tweets for him when he couldn't post, like, dates and stuff.  So I do his Twitter now, and I know some people get creeped out.  But if you just look at the bio, I say that it's me.  Yeah.  That he made his Twitter page in honor of him and to give information to his fans.  Sure.  I'm not posting anything like, hey, I read a book today.  It's all the tree stuff.  Yeah.  You know, if you want to know what I'm reading or what I'm doing, you know, go to my Twitter. 
[03:22:00]  Info on his projects.  Absolutely.  So don't get creeped out.  It's not him tweeting from heaven.  It's just me here on Earth, lonely, and just being a Twitter whore.  You're going to have to come back, man.  Oh, thank you.  I want to come back definitely right before it releases.  Jonathan and I are planning to do a huge album release party for Mr. P.  So hopefully you guys can come to that. 
[03:22:30]  I don't know when it's going to be, but, you know, when I come back, I should have more information.  Yeah.  I'm sure Jonathan will have it in Tripoli.  If he survives, I'm so worried about my other husband.  If his head is attached to his body, there'll be a great album release party.  He makes it back alive from the fucking Ivory Coast.  He doesn't get lung worm.  Some foreign disease.  What is he doing?  We all have anxiety now.  Enough already, Jonathan.  We get it.  You like to explore.  Yes.  Thank you, Opie.  We get it.  Enough already. 
[03:23:00]  He actually told me, he said, you know, if it's safe and everything,  and they want tourism, you know, I could definitely book you,  and you could, like, perform, and I'm like.  Oh, great.  Great.  That's good.  You want me to perform in Africa?  Yeah.  You'd be a queen.  Yeah, before you know it, you're using a queen.  I like black guys, but I like Americans.  Without assault rifles. 
[03:23:30]  We're going to start our little thing here.  So, we'll see you guys soon.  Good seeing you guys.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  No problem.  Von DiCarlo, everyone.  Bravo.  Thank you, Von.  Have a safe holiday.  We'll see you guys in 2012 when the world ends.  Oh, God.  Thank you.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Here is XM. </pre>
