<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion of "Call In Gay Day," a planned gay community economic protest.  The hosts initially mocked the event but later clarified its purpose, prompting a listener, Marcy, to call in, angrily accusing the show of creating the offensive event.  The hosts vehemently denied this, explaining the event's origins and engaging in humorous, often crass, banter with Marcy and other callers.  A staff roll call jokingly noted some absences as being due to "calling in gay."

The conversation then veered into sexually explicit territory, focusing on child actors and a desire to see them nude, alongside off-color jokes and speculation about celebrities' appearances and lives.  The hosts transitioned to cynical and humorous commentary on the arrest of Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich for corruption charges.

Next, the show debuted a comedic, nonsensical song written live for a supposed Van Halen comeback.  The hosts also discussed Oprah Winfrey's weight gain, speculating on the reasons behind it.  The show then transitioned to a discussion of Spalding Gray's suicide, followed by commentary on the New York Yankees' acquisition of C.C. Sabathia and the surprisingly low number of bank robberies in New York City that year.  They also covered musicians protesting the use of their music in Guantanamo Bay, focusing on Rage Against the Machine.  The death anniversaries of Richard Pryor and Otis Redding were also briefly mentioned.

Further topics included a segment on women donating eggs for money, highlighting the high price commanded by donors with specific characteristics. The hosts then discussed a gruesome news story about three Ukrainian teenagers who videotaped themselves torturing and murdering people; one host described his visceral reaction to the video.  They returned to Oprah Winfrey's weight, expressing annoyance at media coverage of a billionaire's weight problems during a time of economic hardship.  Marcy called again, this time addressing a misunderstood promo for a "Call in Gay Day" segment, leading to further clarification and a qualified apology from Marcy.  A quiz about a dog frozen to a sidewalk concluded this segment.  Throughout, crude humor and offensive language were prevalent.

The show continued with further discussion of Marcy's complaint and the hosts’ defense of their comedic intent, using the website "Meatspin.com" (explicit content implied) as an example of media misinterpretations.  They then discussed Jay Leno's return to late-night television and the "Butt Bandit" case.  A call with UFC president Dana White followed, covering the UFC Fight for the Troops, the Kimbo Slice controversy, the UFC's state, and the lack of government support for wounded veterans.  The conversation also touched upon the war in Iraq and the insufficient media coverage of wounded soldiers.

The broadcast shifted to a comparison of how Canada and the US handled the return of war dead, criticizing the US media's focus on trivial issues like Oprah's weight while ignoring the struggles of returning soldiers.  Dana White was again cited as providing more honest accounts of soldiers' experiences. The conversation then devolved into sexually explicit and offensive jokes, including discussions of pornography and child pornography (referencing Doug Stanhope's stand-up). A listener recounted masturbating to underage girls discussing sexting. A fake caller, pretending to be a previous caller, was exposed.

A caller shared how his friend's funeral was threatened by the Westboro Baptist Church, eliciting angry and vulgar responses from the hosts regarding Shirley Phelps-Roper and the group.  They discussed a veterans biker group counter-protesting. A significant portion focused on Anthony's call to the Ron and Fez show, criticizing their perceived hypocrisy about viewing an 18-year-old Hermione Granger nude. This upset Fezz, leading to a lengthy discussion about his emotional reaction and personality.  Audio clips of Fezz’s emotional response were played.  The show concluded with a live read for Ashley Madison, followed by further sexually explicit and vulgar conversations, including jokes about anal sex and a story about a classmate's question about female anatomy.  The broadcast then abruptly ended.  Opie, Anthony, and Jimmy were present throughout.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  Roll call.  Opie here.  Uh, Anthony present.  Jimmy?  Right here, Opie.  Alright.  Who called in gay today? That's what we're getting at.  Anyone?  I didn't forget.  Did anyone call in gay?  Sunbrain, are you here?  I'm here, sir.  Danny?  Oh, Danny.  Danny.  All right, Danny's here. 
[00:00:30]  I'd have counted for.  How about that gay kid that works here, Travis?  He's got the wife who's a beard.  Right here.  Hey, Travis made it in.  I was sure he wasn't going to be in for gay day.  Don't come to work if you're gay day.  What is it? A day without gay, they're calling it.  Yeah.  A day without gay.  The whole country's supposed to, like, stop in its tracks.  If you're gay, you don't come into work, you don't buy anything, then you're supposed 
[00:01:00]  to show that the economic impact that gays have in this country.  And that kind of says, hey, don't screw with us.  We're a powerhouse.  Yeah.  Well, you screw with us.  You know.  I'll figure differently.  Baby.  Baby.  Baby.  Baby. 
[00:01:30]  Could you take some of that packing tape and put it over my mouth for the rest of the  day there, Timmy?  Wow.  I was.  And I was ready to give you a compliment.  Yeah.  You said it best yesterday when you said, don't get your hair cut today.  You know, it's best to get those over with early in the show.  Because when you think gay, you think Broadway, you think.  Yeah.  Hair stylists.  Hair.  Haircuts.  Interior decorators.  What's some of those other gay jobs? 
[00:02:00]  They work pretty good.  Wedding planner.  Wedding planner.  Flight attendant.  Yeah.  Flight attendant.  Yeah.  You're not going to get the good service if you're flying out today, I guess.  Well.  Interior designer.  I said interior decorator.  Executive producer.  Did Steve call in today?  Uh-oh.  Where is Steve?  We're doing roll call, man.  Boy, everyone managed to direct themselves out of bed.  Do you know what I was giggling at? 
[00:02:30]  I just kept thinking of doing a roll call that you were going to call.  All these names.  And then, because Steve's not there, I thought you were just going to yell Steve.  And then hit crickets.  Look, Steve had to come in just to show he's here.  Exactly.  He's not showing us he's here.  He's showing the gays that I don't listen to all the rules.  I'm a rebel.  I'm a rebel in the gay community.  What about Sam?  And E-Rock.  Do they call in gay?  They sure do.  They called in gay?  They're not here.  Sam?  Did I see Sam? 
[00:03:00]  Mm-hmm.  And E-Rock.  E-Rock, are you present?  Wow.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  Oh, there's E-Rock.  All right.  And Sam?  I'm here.  And Sam made it.  Very good.  No one on our staff called in Guy.  Stuntbrain said there is somebody that called in sick today.  Yeah.  Or called in gay.  Yeah.  Alberto called in this morning.  Really?  Yeah, and he had the real bad sore.  Wait, wait.  You've got to explain who Alberto is.  Alberto runs the board on the K-Rock side of things here. 
[00:03:30]  He inserts the commercials inside.  Right.  So when we go to break, he does all that stuff for us.  So he called in gay today?  Well, he called in and he said, I have a really bad sore throat.  I bet you do.  And I said, did you forget what today is?  And he got very upset.  Oh, no.  See, that's what the problem's going to be now.  Because people are going to go, well, you were very brave.  Every day people call in sick.  Yeah, but we warned everyone.  Today is the day.  If you even have the flu, you get out of bed and then show your face at work. 
[00:04:00]  I told him we accept him.  Because they're going to be talking behind your back for the next year if you don't.  Until the next call in gay day.  Oh, I'm so offended by just listening to this talk.  Are you?  Yeah.  I know where you're leaning to.  Oh, please.  We have a dummy.  Can we get her on the phone?  Yeah, I've got to get her on the phone.  Yeah, I've got to get her on the phone.  Please.  We have a dummy that called Stunt Brain yesterday after the show.  This is why I don't think we really should try hard on our radio show because... 
[00:04:30]  When did you plan on starting?  Well, we could just, like, read from a nursery rhyme book and get the same...  We should do that.  ...the same thing accomplished every morning.  That's what I do at bedtime.  Blah, blah, blah.  Blah, blah, blah.  Because then you get people that call and don't have a clue what's going on with our show.  No.  They listen with half an ear, as they call it. 
[00:05:00]  Well, why don't we get right into this complaint call that came in after the show?  Oh, no.  It's a Stunt Brain.  Oh, no.  Oh, listen to this, Jimmy.  It's crazy.

[00:07:30]  americans decide or some other group that wants to show that they have a power base in this country  to not go to work and not purchase anything to show that their their dollars make a difference in  this country so they take the day off they like go on strike pretty much and uh uh it it really never  works by the way these things never make an impact this is just you go about your daily business and  you you don't see a difference but uh they came up with this we didn't make this up you dummy 
[00:08:00]  and um i just want to express my deep disappointment in uh your programming allowing these two um  people to to promote this on the air and um it continues the hatred and the um  the disaster that this entire world is in is it um i would appreciate a call back i will be writing

[00:10:30]  think of us dummy we're human beings technically you know biologically we're human beings and we were  not offended in the least by it all the gay people that uh actually are taking place in this they're  not offended by it again another self-important jackass that thinks she knows what everyone else in the  country's thinking oh god humanity so doomed we're so doomed can we get her on the phone stump brain 
[00:11:00]  uh travis is trying to call her now all right and travis what do you got travis running in is she at  work or is she calling gee uh there's no answer but it sounds like it might be her work number that  she left yeah so i'll i mean i'm gonna keep trying but all right let's try to get this dummy on the on  the air oh god it does show you though what happens when somebody listens to one little piece  takes that out of context yeah but she's just an example of somebody who called there are people that 
[00:11:30]  like would write a letter and never call right and then all of a sudden a letter came into the station  what was that thing you guys did yeah and it's like well they wouldn't even ask it if they just  put a little file of of complaints and then two or three more of those ill-informed complaints come  in and you gotta right next thing you know you're getting fired because some dummy writes a letter  that doesn't even know what the hell they're talking about nutty as a fruitcake that's right oh that  woman got a mouth like an outboard motor exactly yeah so that's what we deal with shut it we deal

[00:29:00]  government property law yeah and then paragraph one we go back to illinois sector one unbelievable  uh other neighborhood people talk about the governor at the train station at the cta train station a few  blocks away some commuters wanted to give the governor the benefit of the doubt i think it's sad  because i like him he's a good governor but unfortunately things happen i really can't say  which was the hardest part but i i was shocked but for others it's time yeah i think he had some  there was some shystiness going on around there some shystiness that was jesse jackson right 
[00:29:30]  huh that was jesse jackson the first before i don't i don't think so no no just commuters  commuters oh it sounded like he was a good governor that's not like jesse jackson yeah they say his son  might have been the fifth guy they're speculating his son was one of the guys who might have been  possibly mentioned for that seat oh drag jesse jackson into this i would love to say very happy  they try and drag obama into this and they have nothing on them they don't have them on any uh  any wiretaps nothing so but the what the gop is uh very angry that obama had any connection with this 
[00:30:00]  guy yeah but they're saying rahm emanuel may be the guy who tipped everybody off to this uh obama's  right hand man so they may have wanted him out for some reason yeah and also i mean everyone has  a connection to everyone yeah i mean all these government officials do business with each other  you can't you know did obama ever talk to him oh yeah what they do yeah stupid politicians hey we got  an update on alberto it's calling gay day yes and we did roll call at the beginning of the show and uh 
[00:30:30]  everyone's in and we lost one uh alberto called in he's the board op so when we go to break he makes  sure all the local commercials are playing and the promos and all that and then make sure we get uh  back on time all that crap right well he called in very very sick pretty much with the flu and then  mike goes you do realize it's calling gay day he freaked out he forgot so alberto i swear to god  dragged his ass in here really yes he just showed up oh god is that the truth stuff right he came in 
[00:31:00]  and i walked in the other studio and he he is so sick i sent him home i said if you get everyone  sick you're fired so he did show up just to prove that he's sick and not gay and now he's going back  home i guess if you step through the door and into her and then you could leave immediately then you're  not gay we stamped his card yeah you stamped his non-gay card and he was able to go home you validate  for not gay where does he live mike how far like how far from there well i know he has to take two 
[00:31:30]  subway trains so what a homophobe wow really it's what goes on in america though i mean you know  people that's funny i don't know what i think so he took two subway trains just to come in to show  that he really is sick why can't he be more like a guy like uh steve from bayshore who doesn't care  that you know yeah you know he's uh sexual preference and uh we applaud steve from bayshore for not uh  showing up it's unfortunate because we could really use his instant feedbacks today but uh 
[00:32:00]  look i understand he's uh he's doing what's right for him so i do support you steve whatever you uh  whatever you do i suspected he was gay i didn't know yeah i know but it was like uh it was the hair he  was like too attentive to his hair and um it was just kind of too quiet and lurking it was always kind  of like a weird we always thought he just liked the era but now we're we're finding out some things  about him he likes blonde hair blue eyed guys yeah yeah i always got a quick weird vibe sexual  vibe off him like he was kind of looking at me in a weird way whatever where's a little pink triangle 
[00:32:30]  sewn on his uh jacket it explains his alcoholism that's for sure well you know you try to you try  to bury that stuff with foods it just doesn't work he's got to accept it and i guess today is his  first step in really accepting it by uh yeah yeah well not showing up he's a funny guy i mean steve's a  really a lot of you know a lot of the funniest writers in hollywood honestly are gay they're  very creative gay people are hilarious i mean that's a lot of reasons they run the show business  and steve is a brilliant comedy writer and that's one reason there you go let's go to chicago for 
[00:33:00]  one jeff your governor is a bad boy yes he is what do you got on you know what oh it's even worse  though dude when he was running for that seat his whole platform was to clean up the corruption  in chicago ah real wonderful you thought about a hypocrite huh yeah absolutely and you know what  my wife looked up online yesterday because he took over for uh george ryan who is now in prison 
[00:33:30]  and i thought okay we got two governors but my wife looked up online before bugoyevich came in there  there's been three different governors for illinois that have been arrested for corruption so  i mean chicago's always been known for crime and corruption and and the mob but i didn't know  it was that deep and it's also you look at a guy like spitzer who i didn't like but what he was doing  is so stupid and unimportant compared to what this guy like that this guy is like a guy who should 
[00:34:00]  really lose his gig and go to jail but spitzer what was he doing we should get a list of all the  governors in recent in the last just few years and what they've been up to it's unbelievable  we got him hey uh booby man from brooklyn i i he just heard that steven s from bayshore will be  calling in uh gay all week because he's really really oh really gay each day for a place that he  likes one like well this this day is for the left hand this day is for the right hand wednesday is for  the mouth we got it steve it culminates with friday no he can only get up till thursday if you do 
[00:34:30]  the math the big a two hands mouth eight nope monday through thursday friday is when he has to put  the feet together after the break we might have the uh the final version of the van halen comeback  hit single you don't like it even though van halen has come and gone we've been working on  their new song for them or jimmy has actually it's the new song they haven't come out with a new 
[00:35:00]  material yet they i think what they did first was they toured first yeah because it gets people  into the vibe like wow they really are back and i think that what's gonna happen now is how would  they get a second tour out of it you gotta do mathematics they couldn't just do an album then  a tour that's one and done sure so you get the interest of everybody up by doing the tour first  they're gonna go see you yeah now you have new material boom new interest in a second tour and then  you write horrible songs i don't think it's horrible example that jimmy gave i think we're back is 
[00:35:30]  probably what they're like we're back and the exclamation point after the song well the faithful  listeners you think parentheses and better than ever we're back oh yeah you got that no no no no the  parentheses come in uh in a in in the song uh it's a crazy world and in the parentheses and i'm a  little bit crazier oh no but i'm a little bit crazier it's a crazy world but i'm a little bit crazier  again the chills well that i get just from a title that's where the parentheses well after the break 
[00:36:00]  we added the second uh the second what the second uh second verse to the second verse to the like it  the van halen song we're back pete from morningside helping us out with this we'll debut it next and  also we have a boohoo for oprah uh oprah winfrey today we'll explain in a few minutes opie and anthony  where are we going opie and anthony don't worry we got control of this i want to ask anthony something  uh-oh because he's a very knowledgeable man i try i i like to think i know a lot

[00:37:30]  uh but you're very knowledgeable this is what i ask you today my friend yes i hope i can help  and please don't cheat all right no cheating cheating sucks for the show i'm actually putting  the uh pal talk text thing down below okay toolbar so uh no one can help me there  um if steven s from basher was uh writing in some feedback today uh-huh he would write something like  i don't know hey hope check to make sure aunt's hair plugs didn't call in gay today  why would they call in gay i don't know they couldn't see obviously that means that steven s 
[00:38:00]  isn't writing today because that doesn't make any sense that doesn't make sense it's not funny  right uh it stinks yeah absolutely and that's not steve from basher steve is a funny guy i'm just  proving to the people out there that he really isn't uh writing today you know steve i gotta thank him  because he did all my window treatments at the house uh and just the bang up job yeah yeah every 
[00:38:30]  single uh window uh perfect too the colors match i don't know how they do it those people you were  suspicious weren't you i was i was but he came in uh all the window treatments yeah i say curtains yeah  and he's like no they're window treatments and and you were like well i know the guy's down on his  luck and doesn't make much money yeah yeah i know he's doing whatever he can but something doesn't  seem right here and then he had a friend help him really yeah it was a friend he came in one car  but i i don't question it you know know what's weird about the friend i've never seen this friend 
[00:39:00]  at fh riley's when when uh steven s is drinking his sorrows away yeah well and this is what i ask you  today please don't cheat okay what happened 50 years ago today 50 years ago today and and don't even  fake it if you do know because you read this ahead of time then tell me i would say uh let's see  i know you're trying to do the math 1958 my friend 1958 yes 50 years ago today yes sergeant pepper 
[00:39:30]  taught his band to play oh my god that's the 60s going in and out of style that's guaranteed to make  you smile no hold on 1958 what would it say december 10th uh-huh uh 1958 50 years ago today  i'm gonna guess the first uh first uh things in space whether it was monkeys or or uh sputnik 
[00:40:00]  yeah first thing nope wasn't sputnik i'll tell you this much um the people that did this yeah  were very very brave oh very brave wow uh people are guessing kevin from connecticut uh first uh  uh blacks to uh go into a white school segregation no damn it kevin from connecticut writes 50 years  ago today anthony graduated high school oh that isn't true at all that old gag 
[00:40:30]  these people were in my opinion very very brave and i think you'll agree very very  50 years ago today the first time this was can you say where it happened no uh in the u.s is it  the first uh first um no that was earlier than that what i was thinking something with commercial  flight that's why i said what because i i see i could read you yes yeah it is first passenger jet flight 
[00:41:00]  in u.s 50 years ago today that like i said those are some brave people was it one of the comets  huh was it a comet what do you mean a comet the plane i don't know was it called the comet was that  the name of the first airline no i would guess like the plane itself no no he means like oh i don't know  uh uh was united a big what was the one that um eastern airlines maybe eastern there's pan am yeah  pan am was around there was another weird old one and then there was one that uh howard hughes howard 
[00:41:30]  hughes was uh in charge of for a while uh anthony i got the airline oh yes what a coincidence because  it was called ted's airline oh wow ted's airline was the first airline 50 years ago oh wow and they  had the first flight was it trans world airlines i don't know we'll look it up it's probably twa or  you should have called it had nothings airlines because that's what i did i should i should have 
[00:42:00]  looked at you first and see if you had anything going on a spark of creativity just a blank stare  back at me thanks jimmy i didn't know what to have i had nothing you know it's your bit i i didn't have  anything i started it with a car and a ramp it didn't go well that's all ted has very short  not everything has to be a winner with ted yeah uh mr brain yes anthony is amazing uh it was uh  national airlines inaugurating service here in america in 58 but in 1952 the de havalon comet 
[00:42:30]  yes was a british airlines flight and so the brits did it before we did but it was a comet  why did the brits get to do it before we did we do everything first for us the f is that about i don't  know because their lives are valueless they took a bunch of dollars believe me it worked out better  for us than the brits because that comet uh had a little problem with a pressurized cabin and  blew apart a few of them oh really in midair did it really and people plummeted to their death yes 
[00:43:00]  oh it was a horrible horrible thing they couldn't figure out like the um shape of the pressure  container and uh metal stress so uh stress fatigue you know what they had almost square that's why  windows are round on planes they had squared windows and the corners of anything that made  of metal are going to have a lot of stress on them so the stress cracks through the corners of the  windows actually caused the size to just blow out of the plane and they would uh come down in pieces 
[00:43:30]  with people and metal and everything else i didn't realize that like i knew that they were having there  was one that was having problems great the plane looked really cool we're gonna get a picture big  there it is oh wow that does look cool it's a cool like old classic looking passenger plane like an  old boeing um but uh yeah a few problems oops the de Havilland comet is a wonderful aircraft  it's safe as you're plummeting into the ocean yeah all right we'll get that picture up on 
[00:44:00]  onaradio.com uh where you at with oprah uh this stupid billionaire but i don't think she likes me  this stupid billionaire wants us to feel sorry uh wants us to feel sorry for her today she's a  billionaire i just plow right along i keep just plowing the snow uh oprah has gained a lot of weight  and she wants us to feel sorry for her i guess because she put her fat ass on her uh on the cover 
[00:44:30]  of her magazine did she yeah she's now at 200 pounds and in 2005 she was at uh what stumpering 160  pounds what so so they have the current picture of her on on the old magazine right next to the old  picture of her weighing 160 pounds what the hell is with her and she's going for a boo hoo hoo i guess  there's um what's what problems does she have a lot i mean oprah in 2005 she was 160 pounds 1994 
[00:45:00]  she got down to 140 pounds is it having to deal with uh greenstein is that her problem  making her eat jesus christ we'll all be blimps  take that one uh she's blaming part of the weight gain on a thyroid condition anthony  what that has slowed down her metabolism eating cow thyroid after she finishes the rest of it  the economy's falling apart and we have to feel sorry for a billionaire does this make sense to 
[00:45:30]  anybody it's like quit eating fatso exactly that's it stop look i want to eat the crappy food last night  i was shaking because uh uh dr steve sent that amazing gift that jimmy opened up yesterday with  all the blue boxes there's so much goodness in those boxes it starts with a with a big  box and goes all the way to a tiny tiny little box and every box has a treat in it dr steve i curse  the yes and i'm sitting there at home i'm shaking because i want to like destroy this stuff but i don't 
[00:46:00]  i ate those stupid little chocolate filled little those were unbelievable and then followed it up with  some chocolate covered graham crackers they're lovely and this was after eating dinner yeah like right  after yeah i finished dinner fast because i knew those were sitting there oh you had them shipped to your  houses yes yes i get mine shipped to xm because the beauty is this i'll have a couple of each i tried 
[00:46:30]  a few i probably had like five pieces six pieces and then just give it to the staff this way i treated  myself and i'm done i won't pick at it at home yeah i have nothing at home but apples i'm bringing mine  in uh in tomorrow stupid apples yeah well so so we can't feel sorry for the billionaire we all want  to eat like pigs oprah yes she partly blames her inflated flab on a thyroid condition that has  slowed her metabolism we said that stop it this and medication for that and ready for this and given  her a fear of working out she has a fear of working out fear of working out what is that about 
[00:47:00]  called being lazy yeah you all have yeah isn't that yeah that's just called being like oh god i really  got to get to the gym right she also concedes that her willpower has taken a backseat to a busy schedule  because she was like uh running around the country supporting obama and all that crap i felt like a fat cow  i wanted to disappear writes winfrey whose body mass index of 31.8 is considered obese by the centers 
[00:47:30]  of disease control yeah how about this you can't control yourself that's all it is yeah you have no  willpower and your timing sucks people are losing jobs all over the effing country and you're gonna  and you and you want some sympathy yep go away shoving bonbons in your face go away yeah where's the  fatty let me get a fatty picture of her up there get the latest cover it's everywhere latest the  latest fatty picture of her she is huge but you know what though her listeners her people  all think like she does they're a bunch of like back and forth with their weight cows so a lot of 
[00:48:00]  them will look at this and they love her even more because she's imperfect and she gets fat like they  do like me she's like me i understand they do they love that you know what though we were i'm gonna go  with jimmy's point and it's something i think stumpery and i were talking about i think anthony jumped in  on the conversation in the office this i'm suspicious we're suspicious that she might have  gained the weight on purpose so now she can introduce a another product that our fat housewives  out there will start buying and gobbling up and remember that doctor maybe some kind of food plan 
[00:48:30]  or something did all the walking with her and put out all those best-selling books yeah yeah he's got  a he's got like a hundred acres next to hers in hawaii she's going to make another billion  dollars off this i'll tell you what i'm i'm not gonna lie our old boss went over to work for oprah  winfrey and i'm i'm i'm hoping that it has something to do with elo with elo elo is is his  force is making her eat hopefully he fell off the wagon he comes into work drunk she's gotta eat to  just deal with him oh that's fantastic i gotta admit and i know he still listens to the show i'm 
[00:49:00]  secretly hoping it has something to do with you either no oprah you look great yeah could you  just run out and get me some like mcdonald's or something oprah you got it oh within two weeks  oprah realized oh my god this guy knows nothing yeah in her office  dude she looked good in 94 there's a picture of her 94 she looks like angela bassett  where she had like her arms looked like a little flabby bassett hound 
[00:49:30]  big jowl dummy that's right oprah you're not untouchable get on a treadmill stop at the fear  thing i don't i don't i don't think she i think it's in the middle i don't think she would do it  on purpose but i think that she just will eat and get to a point where she's disgusted knowing that  when she needs to lose the weight yeah she can because she has enough money for personal chefs and  trainers she's a billionaire she's she's sneaking into a closet somewhere and eating because she 
[00:50:00]  she you know she has every meal cooked for her she she does have like you said the personal trainers  when she needs them and a chef who can make good sweet tasting food that's healthy there's regular  slobs out there they don't get all that and they're struggling with their weight she has no excuse  what happened that picture all right yeah there's some just brutal pictures of oprah if you  google it on the cover of another magazine her awful 
[00:50:30]  well figured out she's her audience will love the fact that she got fat again because they relate to  her struggle they relate to the fact even with all her money she still balloons up and gets fat and  she says the same crap they do i have a thyroid kit me too yeah me too it's the thyroid but you know  what no one knows who the real oprah is she could be just doing this because she feels like she needs  a little you know a little pump but gail knows a little pump up in the in her uh you know her 
[00:51:00]  popularity what i thought you meant there were like a nut but there were clone oprahs like no one  knows who the real one is well that skinny one she drags out if i don't look at me like that  it was a what do you got on oprah or how far you got with oprah i'm trying  oh before i forget bob kelly i wanted to spit on him last night i saw him i walk he walked in the 
[00:51:30]  comedy seller wearing he looks good he lost so much weight yeah bastard but that's what happens  by the way oprah you when you work out and you just don't eat carbs like bobby's been very  disciplined yeah yeah he has yeah you got to be disciplined he's wearing a slim down jacket  and he walked in with like a puffy ascot scarf on no wrapped around and tucked into the front of his  dude an ascot i thought it was a joke i'm saying i've never wanted someone to help me tease 
[00:52:00]  someone so bad yeah i've never wanted patrice or keith robinson as badly as i did last night be  there yeah bobby walked in wearing this ascot and i just started ripping on him like what is that  and he goes it's called style oh is it bobby it's called style he so is calling in gay today he's a fool  but that reminded me because i said he looked like a pilot  an old adventurer pilot you're b-17 scott snoopy that's wonderful bob is a yutz his name should 
[00:52:30]  be scott right not a gem but geez i'm trying to pull up i'm trying to pull back on the stick  and miss this mountain wow i should have called in gay  i'm saving my good stuff till later i'm doing rope-a-dope right now  yeah you don't want to fire out a good one in a bombing run because what happens is it like if 
[00:53:00]  there's something happens with it it hits the door on the way out yeah it'll just get  to get lost in the mess i've just left behind me has anyone made the enola gay uh joke yet  well but didn't officially say you know b-29 all right hey uh barrett yeah great i could tell  you what plane it was wonderful geez i'm just a bevy of humor yeah that's all right do you figure  out the plane type we're just going to suffer with the wreckage you're leaving behind i just 
[00:53:30]  want to simplify for everybody uh barrett from pittsburgh my jokes are hitting san diego  wow very good oprah afraid of working out not afraid of donuts exactly exactly  yes why don't we get into the jimmy van halen we're back oh song you want to explain this jimmy  because i think we do this uh on the other side mostly well van halen did a tour as we all know  a pretty successful one they didn't know if david lee roth was it successful i think so yeah they 
[00:54:00]  sold out they made some bucks yeah yeah okay it was uh david lee roth and obviously eddie van halen  and and uh wolf van halen yeah yes but but uh who is the michael anthony michael anthony is closer  to sammy hagar or whatever and wouldn't do it so they got wolfgang eddie's son to play bass  and um they didn't do any new material they did a very successful uh tour of all their uh classics  that people wanted to hear classics and uh what happened was they started we started to speculate 
[00:54:30]  that they were going to put together some new material and i've never thought van halen was that  great to be honest i know i'm gonna get killed for that i never thought they were that good i  recognize eddie's a great guitarist some of their songs i like by and large i thought i didn't like  them right so i started to think that the new stuff they would put back out would be as lyrically  irritating as their old stuff and one would be we're back because david lee roth always had that  kind of wink and be silly thing yeah that's the whole gist of this thing is um oh it's just the 
[00:55:00]  way the way van halen was uh especially when you watch the old videos you watch the old videos of  van halen where they're just there's such phony camaraderie between all of them and and the way  the video was and david lee roth doing his his karate moves and and eddie with the smile and and they'd  look at each other and and this this abomination of a song that jimmy put together is absolutely perfect 
[00:55:30]  oh yeah it it does it's something they would do and that's what is so embarrassing just  thinking about it because we do like the the thing of we're back and we can picture them  like eddie playing and leaning back and then david lee roth back to back like them looking at each  other over the shoulders and like we're back and then saying it together oh and then eddie walks away  and strums a little bit and then david you know he's like he uh what's the word he uh peacocks  when he walks in preening yeah walk away so uh lyrically they always stunk i thought jimmy came 
[00:56:00]  up with a second verse and we got this guy pete from morningside doing all the uh guitar work for  you to make it into a real song so now we debut the latest version of the van halen comeback song  this is how jimmy thinks it would go yes i'm i don't know how happy i am with this but i would  really like to be perfect all right we'll we'll keep working on it but uh this is what we got uh to  this point  we've been away for a long long long long time 
[00:56:30]  we've been doing changes we've played some games  the more things change the more things stay the same  the same  we're never an old but we must find us  we're back 
[00:57:00]  we're better than ever  we're back  we're back  together forever  we're back  we're with the devil  we used to jump  we've got a hot fat teacher  i'm on my console  and then we don't run all the way  wait that did run  we're back 
[00:57:30]  we're better than ever  we're back  we're back  together forever  we're back  we're back  you're interrupting  it's only in the chorus that's done i don't think there's any more actual lyrics yeah okay i can picture like while this is happening all the crazy things they'll be showing in the video like one would be like a little bit of a fast motion movement of like uh of eddie trying to wake dave up in the hotel oh no and he's shaking and he's shaking and he pulls the cover away but it's dave's feet and then he realizes like in the eye couple he's dave's face it the wrong way on the bed why why are you doing this 
[00:58:00]  he's doing this to me  like that'd be the kind of thing  like that'd be the kind of thing  we're back  like they're trying to get the tour bus ready  and there's a bunch of  like they open up the dressing room  and like all these girls come out  goosebumps  really  they're giving me  and they're not good goosebumps  they're not like wow this is great goosebumps 
[00:58:30]  it is the douche chill goose bump  well they wouldn't show it realistically  they wouldn't show  Dave walking out of a CBS radio  with like a footprint on his ass  and Eddie trying to  trying to sing  and then having half that tongue chopped off  that'd be slightly depressing  man man  we're back  we're back  we're back  yeah 
[00:59:00]  we're back  What do you want to add to it, Jimmy?  Is it almost good?  Yeah, I have to do a little bit more.  All right, do a little thinking.  I like the old retrospective in the middle  about where they put in some of their old songs  and try to be lyrical, like just what they've done.  Yeah. 
[00:59:30]  I want to add a match to it.  Doesn't it need some kind of gimmick?  Yeah, well, we're a little...  Like a big gong or a chainsaw  or some dumb thing that some of these bands like to do.  I want them to take out that we're a little bit older  but not much wiser  because that's actually a song.  That's actually going to be a song.  That's the B-side.  We're a little bit older and then in parentheses,  but we ain't much wiser.  Just like the other one, his parentheses too.  Yeah, all right.  Hey, to get the bad taste out of everyone's mouth here,  there's only one thing that we're able to do here. 
[01:00:00]  All right?  And it's to do this.  Oh, God, no.  Sleeps.  I'm feeling pretty good.  La, la, la, la.  Taking my time on the la, la, la, la, la.  Snowfall down in the la, la, la, la, la.  Everybody's singing like la, la, la, la.  Danking on a holler at the la, la, la, la, la.  Making my way to the la, la, la, la, la, la, la.  La, la, la, la, la.  Shut up. 
[01:00:30]  Oh, yeah.  My favorite part coming off.  Hey, hey, hey, hey.  All right, cool.  I'm called falling in the town.  Yeah.  I'm like a million miles away.  Not a snow and like a sea.  Like a sand above the beach.  The light's floating in the trees.  The people shining in the stream. 
[01:01:00]  And the people in the light.  All the children in the light.  Singing holy, holy night  Ugh, this one sucks  I was feeling pretty good  Boy, y'all, la, la, la  Taking my time on the la, la, la, la  Snow falling down in the la, la, la, la  Everybody singing like la, la, la, la 
[01:01:30]  Dacking all the halls with the la, la, la, la  Making my way to the la, la, la, la, la, la  La, la, la, la, la, la  La, la, la, la  La, la, la  I like to sit out on the pier  And look across the bay  I don't think about a thing  Up here  I feel a million miles of rain 
[01:02:00]  Notice Redding?  Wind up like him  Like a storm  A falling snow  And I'm spinning through the trees  And I'm shining in the road  All the people in the light  And all the children in the light  Singing holy, holy night  Nice  No  I think I'm turning some people around  With Sleeves Christmas song  I don't think you are  That's Sleeves everyone 
[01:02:30]  Yes  You like it now, Jimmy?  No  I could have  I could have liked it  Like I didn't mind the fa, la, la, la, la  The fa, I understood it was a Christmas thing  But the, the, and then we're doing this  And the la, la, la  It just  It was supposed to be meaningful  But to me it fell woefully short  Oh, it certainly did  It could have been interesting if it was a different hook in there  It was a different song  Yes  By a different singer  It could have been interesting 
[01:03:00]  Well, he's, he's, he's contemplative  He sits on the pier  La, la, la, la  And he, and he looks across the bay  Well, yeah  What?  Exactly  How about the Hudson River?  Why don't you sit there and look at Jersey?  He's taking a break from, from, from his life  That is obviously, you know, hell  Hell on earth  Well, what's, what's so hellish about it?  He likes to drink a beer  There's a lot of weird stuff going on in the, in the world  And he's like, he's just reflecting and going  You know what?  I'm taking a little time for myself  I'm gonna have a little beer  Yeah, how about he goes to Christmas  I'm not gonna worry about bills  And if I'm gonna be fired  And, and you know what?  I'm gonna, I'm gonna get into the little Christmas spirit 
[01:03:30]  Even though it's a, it's all about just, uh, shopping  How about he, how about he gets a second job  Or goes back to school  Instead of drinking and wasting his time on a pier  Yeah  He's just like  He's just looking across the bay  He's just simplifying everything for a little while  Good for him  I hope he's sitting on the pier  Before he gets back in the rat race  And he gets attacked like Will Smith and I am legend  I Am Legend  You know what?  Bunch of dead bodies  Fa la la la la  La la la la  In the la la la la  In the la la la la  Yeah  In the la la la la  Yeah  Yeah 
[01:04:00]  Look at the bay like Spaulding Gray dude  Oh, my God.  It's calling you, isn't it?  No, it's Spalding.  Spalding.  Well, once again, half the people love it, half the people hate it.  Wash up like a fiddler crab.  Jesus.  Did he have a wash up?  Yeah, they found him.  They found him.  He jumped off a ferry here in New York for the people.  How could you kill yourself there? 
[01:04:30]  I would just land in the water and swim.  Yeah.  There goes the ferry.  There's something about killing yourself.  Don't do that swim part.  Yeah, but as soon as you hit the water, I think you realize it was a dumb idea and you start  swimming for sure.  I bet you that's what happened, but he didn't make it.  Yeah?  He couldn't swim.  Yeah, I bet you that's what happened.  It can't be still a good idea when you hit the water.  That's what I'm thinking.  There was water in his lungs, Sam.  He was a monologist.  He was spreading joy.  And he drank the whole lake, Sam. 
[01:05:00]  There was nothing left.  He was floating with slacks on.  My houseboat was sitting there in mud because all the water soaked into his fat little pants.  His lungs were like a sham wow.  Like that girl's ass.  I thought she had one.  And I was like, what a sham.  Wow.  So Jim C music.  Yeah. 
[01:05:30]  We do have to take a break, Jim C.  Okay.  We got to do more Quincy as time goes on.  Just analyzing the awful dialogue in that show.  Oh, yeah.  And I want to play the complaint call we got earlier today.  Again, for the people just tuning in.  You're not going to believe this one.  Some dummy doesn't know what's going on in the world.  We'll explain next.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony. 
[01:06:00]  We got a complaint call.  We're going to play that in a few minutes here.  Are we trying to get her on the...  Yeah?  Okay.  We're trying.  Breaking news.  C.C.  Sabathia.  I always mess up his name.  He is officially a Yankee.  They got him.  I was just watching, I think, Len Berman.  Yeah, I'll keep it local for everybody today.  And he was hinting that this thing might just fall apart. 
[01:06:30]  He was saying, look, you know, because he hasn't signed with the Yankees, this was yesterday.  Yeah.  Len Berman feels like that he wanted to pitch for anyone but the Yankees.  Well, I guess Mr. Berman is wrong today because the Yankees got him.  It's official.  Who gives a crap?  The Mets got K-Rod.  That's all I care about.  K-Rod.  K-Rod!  Yanks got A-Rod.  The Mets got K-Rod.  K-Rod.  He had, what, 60 saves last year? 
[01:07:00]  Something like that?  Wow.  He's ridiculous.  Hence the K.  Yes.  Sabathia, though.  I mean, I know.  He was the big get this free agency season.  I'm so sick of free agency.  Are you?  Yeah, man.  I'm so sick of the Yankees doing, I like the team that was built from the farm system.  That team was the dynasty.  No one has patience to do that anymore.  Cashman stinks.  No one has patience to do that.  I'm with you, actually, Jimmy. 
[01:07:30]  Yeah, they want instant gratification.  That's right.  Because it's not working.  They haven't won since 2000.  Yeah.  So all these big picks, they have not won.  Alex Rodriguez is a bum.  He's like Roma in a way that he's not a big game winner.  No.  And he never will be.  Chokes.  You know who is?  Jeter, who I don't like, but he's a big game player.  Yeah?  Rivera.  Yep.  Big game players.  What about Sabathia?  I don't know enough about him.  I don't care about him.  He's a monster.  Big deal. 
[01:08:00]  How many of them, Randy Johnson was a monster at one point in his career, and then he comes  to the Yankees and he stinks.  Yeah.  So it was Kevin Brown, Kenny Rogers.  They always get him at the end of their career.  Hey, Anthony, I'm going back to you.  Yes?  For a little more knowledge.  Ready?  Economically, it's a mess out there, right?  It certainly is.  With that said, how many people have attempted to rob banks in New York City in this year 
[01:08:30]  that's about to end?  Attempted bank robberies in a year?  Mm-hmm.  I will say...  For New York City.  Let me think.  What does that mean?  All the boroughs, I would assume?  Okay.  I'll say anywhere between 3,000 and 3,200.  Shut up.  Seriously?  Yeah.  Wow.  I'm way off.  Yeah, I say...  Way off.  And I see the number in the paper today, and I'm thinking, even this number seems high. 
[01:09:00]  Attempted to rob banks in New York City this year.  Yeah.  30.  390.  Oh, I figured there were more than just one a day.  Really?  Yeah.  Bank robbers.  People love walking into banks and saying, give me your money.  Stick them up, I think they say.  Stick them up.  I was amazed to read 390.  I thought that was...  I couldn't believe it.  It's like one a day.  It's New York.  Well, last year, just to show you that, because when economic times get rough, this type of stuff,  you know, goes way up, last year, 283, so over 100 more bank robbery attempts this year. 
[01:09:30]  Yeah?  Yeah.  But it's funny, over 3,000, dude, that's all that would be happening.  I know.  What are we living in?  It would be exhausting for the cops.  But sometimes that's just the way it is.  But 20 bank robberies a day, don't you think that would be like a big story?  Attempted bank robberies.  That could be like anything.  You know, the guy goes in and gets caught.  But, no, what would it be, 10 a day?  I figured 10 a day or something like that.  It would be a little less than 10 a day. 
[01:10:00]  Yeah.  It's New York City.  I just figured people walk in and say, hey, give me your money.  Yeah.  Really?  I don't know.  I thought that 390.  I thought they had that bank robbery thing figured out for the most part.  And when you do see one of these guys, you're like, what are you doing?  You can't get away with it.  Right.  It's very hard to get away with that.  Those cameras, boy, they nail you.  I saw a good one in the South where they were doing it.  There was guys that were getting away with bank robbery a lot.  And they started to suspect that they were cops because they knew too much. 
[01:10:30]  And the one guy they got, it's funny, I thought of you, because they got him because he had  that special stance where when he was pointing the gun, he would, like Kenny said, teacup  it and hold it.  Like one hand cupped in the other.  Which is actually two different styles of police gun holding put into one.  And these guys, he had like this checkered jacket on.  They zoomed in and forensically looked at the pattern on the pocket.  And then they got it from his house.  And they just had like a forensic expert look up that company of jacket maker. 
[01:11:00]  Isn't it amazing how they do that?  Oh, you finished.  There was like a little cut, like a little rip in the jacket that they saw in the video.  The guy was smart.  He hung the jacket in a closet alone.  So it wouldn't touch any fibers on anything else.  Oh, wow.  He understood that it had to be hung alone.  So it was touching nothing else.  But it was like, you're going to have to buy a new jacket and throw it out every time  you rub.  Yeah.  But you can't get away with it.  Yeah.  I don't understand why people like keep anything that they had when they committed a crime. 
[01:11:30]  Anything.  Just get rid of it in a very creative, destructive manner.  Of course.  Got to do a little more prepping.  I think we're breaking the CeCe Sabathia story because people are like, I don't see this  on ESPN.  We got a nice AP story out of Vegas of all places.  So there you go.  It'll hit the wire.  We're on top of things on the Opie and Anthony show.  And then probably one of the strange stories today, and then we're going to move on to  that complaint call.  Bands. 
[01:12:00]  This is the headline.  Bands.  Stop musical torture.  This is a weird one.  Guantanamo Bay, you know, and they try to get the prisoners to suffer a little bit and  they crank up the rock and roll.  Yep.  We've all heard this over the years, right?  Yeah.  They don't like that rock and roll music down there.  Military detainees aren't the only ones complaining.  Musicians are banding together.  Liberal.  Is this amazing?  No, it's not.  It's not surprising either.  Yeah, I guess you're right, Jimmy.  I've learned that from you.  Musicians are banding together to demand the U.S. military stop using their songs as weapons. 
[01:12:30]  You faggots.  Are you effing kidding me?  What?  Are you kidding me?  What left wing?  Yeah.  Let's see.  Rage against the machine, of course.  Ring the bell.  Ring the bell, Ant.  Is it rage?  Of course it is.  Of course it is.  They're angry at the machine, man.  Yes.  They have a rage against it.  I don't know what other... 
[01:13:00]  The tactics have been common in the U.S.  War on Terror with forces systematically using loud music on hundreds of detainees in Iraq,  Afghanistan, Guantanamo Bay...  To create fear, disorient, and prolong capture shock.  Basically, it forces the prisoners to stay awake for a very long time.  A campaign launched today has brought together groups, including Massive Attack and musicians  such as Tom Morello, who played with Rage Against the Machine and Audioslave. 
[01:13:30]  It will feature minutes of silence during concerts and festivals.  Oh, great.  I officially hate Rage Against the Machine.  They sucked it.  Yeah.  I don't hate Audioslave because I know Chris Cornell is just one of the greatest singers  of all time.  I don't think he gives a crap about their political stance.  No, I don't think he ever did.  There was a separation I saw in his eyes when we had the whole band in.  He was getting his paycheck.  But I'm done with Rage Against the Machine. 
[01:14:00]  Done.  These are the people, some of them maybe not, but a lot of these are people.  They got Khaled, Sheikh Khaled Mohammed, they are confessing to 9-11.  Yeah.  He plotted it.  They got him.  Yeah.  What do you think?  They just sat him down and politely asked him if he did it?  They were waterboarding him.  Did you do it?  Did you do it?  No, there's interrogation tactics that people use.  Is it considered torture?  I'm sure in some places it might be, but as far as torture goes, wow, it's probably very 
[01:14:30]  mild.  Of course.  There's rules that they have to adhere to.  Compared to what they do to our boys.  We're not beheading them.  Let me read this, because it just gets sickening.  It will feature, these guys are going to feature minutes of silence during concerts and festivals.  Which will be my favorite part of the whole dumb, overrated show.  And thanks.  Thanks a lot to the people that come and pay to see you.  Just going to sit there and not play anything for a while.  Yeah, this is Chloe Davis, I guess, of the British law group Reprieve, which represents  Guantanamo Bay detainees and is organizing the campaign. 
[01:15:00]  Of course she is.  For many Afghan detainees where music was prohibited under Taliban rule, interrogation  by U.S. forces marked their first exposure to the rhythms, played a top volume.  Binyam Mohammed there, now a prisoner at Guantanamo Bay, said men held with him at the CIA's  dark prison in Afghanistan, screamed and smashed their heads against the wall.  Nice.  Good.  Smashed their heads against the walls.  They should have done the same thing when the Taliban was collecting all their weapons. 
[01:15:30]  Now that's what I call headbanging.  You want to guess some of the songs they've used over the years?  We're not going to take it, Twisted Sister?  They did, let me see, is that on the list?  No.  They got Nine Inch Nails, March of the Pigs.  Queen, We Will Rock You.  Really?  Bruce Springsteen, Born in the USA.  Oh, that must annoy him, yeah.  Barney, I Love You.  No way.  Oh, yeah.  They played the Barney, I Love You song? 
[01:16:00]  Over and over and over again at full volume.  You got your Enter Sandman by Metallica.  They said that scared them.  That was actually a scary one.  Really?  Yeah.  Drowning Pool Bodies, which is just a great song.  ACDC Shoots a Thrill in Hell's Bells.  ACDC very popular over there.  They did pull one song, though, because it was too much.  Huh.  Uh, Foundry.  I, yeah, Rob on Long Island, that's right.  Yesterday I loved Rage, and today, you know, they could go F themselves. 
[01:16:30]  Enough.  Enough.  That's how it happens.  That's right.  Uh, David Gray, Babylon.  I don't, I don't know.  I think Rage sucks.  That's like a chick song, I guess, right?  Eminem, White America.  Sesame Street theme song.  God, that would really drive you crazy.  And then, some of the other go-to bands, Aerosmith, Britney Spears, Aguilera, uh, Don McClain.  What, American Pie over there again?  American Pie, I'm sure.  Oh, that would just be torture.  Well, right when you hear that start, you just know it's, you got ten minutes of this crap. 
[01:17:00]  Right.  Oof.  When is this song going to end?  It's not being so inside where we have to try to figure out every lyric.  I hear Obama wants to, uh, close that down.  Yeah.  Guantanamo, bring the prisoners here.  And, uh, I guess, you know, try them in, uh, uh, court and, uh, God.  Is it?  Give them the rights that are given to American citizens, uh, which they don't have.  They're, they're prisoner of, uh, they're prisoners of war. 
[01:17:30]  They're, you interrogate them.  That's what you do.  One thing about it that I don't like is, like, what have they gotten out of it?  Like, how, how many of those guys, just holding guys, like, have we gotten a lot of guys?  I don't know enough about them.  I don't know.  You know something?  I don't want to know.  I'm not down there.  I don't want innocent people held.  That's my only concern is innocent people are being held.  That stinks.  What do you, I'm in the Sierra Mountains.  Fast ready for Jamaica Station.  They have a better playlist than K-Rock. 
[01:18:00]  Wow.  You just insulted Mark.  Yeah.  Hey, Travis, New Hampshire.  How are you, buddy?  You know what they should be playing for everyone?  Oh.  Sleeves.  La, la, la, la.  Ah.  La, la, la, la.  La, la, la.  I'd rather just have, um, Jimmy's, uh, wear back.  Oh, God, yeah.  Awesome.  Over and over again.  All right.  We got to play that and there was mass suicides.  Great that would be.  I feel like a million bucks.  We got to, uh, play a little catch up. 
[01:18:30]  It was also three years ago today.  We got to acknowledge that Richard Pryor died three years ago today at the age of 65.  Yes.  A young man.  What?  Lost a great one.  65 is nothing these days.  Well, you know something.  For a comedian, it's nothing.  But for him, I guess it was like, uh, being 180.  A young man.  That's probably 40 years past where he should have lived.  Right.  That's what he was doing.  That kind of coke he was doing.  Unbelievable.  And Otis Redding also died 41 years ago today in that plane crash.  Yeah.  We're going to take a quick break and we got the complaint call from a really, I get, she's 
[01:19:00]  not a listener of our show.  She's just a dummy in general.  No, she has no clue, uh, about what was happening, that the gays put this together.  Yep.  We were just talking about it.  Yep.  We're having some fun with it and everything.  But, Jesus, what a dummy.  We'll explain next.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Moving right along.  People are trying to figure out how to make money out there. 
[01:19:30]  And, uh, in the Wall Street Journal.  Yeah.  Don't worry, I don't read the Wall Street Journal whatsoever.  I don't think so.  It's a paper for nerds.  But Stunt Brain brought it to my attention.  Hence, in the Wall Street.  Yes.  Overtime.  That's right.  Ova.  O-V-A.  That's right, Anthony.  O-V-A.  Overtime.  Women line up to donate eggs for money.  Really?  It's a great way to make a few bucks. 
[01:20:00]  I hear that's painful.  It's quiz day.  It's Anthony quiz day.  Uh-huh.  I got another one for you.  So far, you're doing pretty well, by the way.  Good.  What is the going rate for a surrogate?  Egg?  Period.  Sorry.  Yeah.  For an egg?  Five grand.  The answer is $25,000, my friend. 
[01:20:30]  Wow.  For one egg?  Egg donors generally receive $3,000 to $8,000.  But a few agencies advertise that they'll pay much more for specific characteristics.  Oh, okay.  You have to have the good egg.  Yeah, we know what that means.  One ad running in campus newspapers promises $25,000 for a donor who is...  White?  What nationality?  Um...  Well...  I guess...  I always get confused by that nationality thing. 
[01:21:00]  What?  Race?  Oh, it's actually 100% Jewish.  I always get confused nationality and religion with that one.  Jewish?  Yeah, 100% Jewish with high SAT scores.  Attractive, at healthy body weight, and free of genetic diseases.  If you got all those, there's an agency that will give you about $25,000 for one of your  eggs.  Wow.  That's pretty amazing, huh? 
[01:21:30]  It's a good way to get the bills paid.  I don't necessarily mean the kid's going to be, you know, that.  There's been some nice blue blood children, born of privilege, good family.  And they turn out like crap anyway.  The one that always makes me laugh is when you get, like, two, like, ugly ducklings.  Yeah.  I mean, just, uh, just, uh...  They both look like beasts.  And they have a beautiful kid.  What's that about?  And it's not adopted.  It's their kid.  Some genes from way back started to come up front.  I don't know, man. 
[01:22:00]  Yeah, I, uh, I knew, uh, girls that were very, very attractive, and then you'd go over to  their house and meet their parents, and the mother's like a, just a fat job of the hut  piece of crap sitting in a chair.  Mm-hmm.  Fod looks like a lurch.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, you can...  People that knew me back in the day know exactly who I'm talking about, too.  No, really?  Yeah.  Back in the day.  Just had a bevy of beautiful daughters.  I think we all used that back in the day too much. 
[01:22:30]  Uh, well, back in the day, I never used it.  Because it was just the day.  The day.  Very good.  Yeah.  Jimmy's got a sick story, and I'm deep.  That's why we're a little off right this second, because I don't know why you watch these  videos, Jimmy.  I don't understand how anybody can be against a death penalty, theoretically.  Listen to this story.  I was not aware of this one.  It's starting to pick up, I guess, a lot of news coverage. 
[01:23:00]  You hear about this story?  Funny stuff, Dan.  Terrible.  Go, Jay.  No, I can't say the word.  It's D-N-E-P-R-O-P-E-T-R-O-V-S-K.  That's a city in the Ukraine.  Ew.  D-N-E-P-R-O-P-E-T-R-O-V-S-K.  Just vomit.  Whatever it is.  Maniacs courtroom video.  There was three teenagers in the Ukraine, and they were videotaping themselves, going  around, murdering people, torturing and murdering people, and they killed, I think it was 21 
[01:23:30]  people in about a month.  And the videos, what they would do is take cell phone videos, and it said it shows the  maniacs going to their murder victims' funerals and taking pictures.  And they would also, like, you know, like, secretly give the finger to the gravestone and  take pictures of it, of people they had tortured and murdered.  Wow.  They're a little antisocial.  But it's amazing the complete disconnection from any humanity. 
[01:24:00]  It was like, I watched, the only video that's around is the two of them.  I think one that started the killing, and then just, like, he did a couple and stopped.  They're killing this guy in the woods with, it looks like a hammer and an ice pick.  And I saw it once, and I was watching it last night.  Oh, how do you watch that?  And I literally, I had to get out of bed, I started to feel like I was in a faint.  Like, I've never felt that way watching a video.  Wow.  It was, uh, and I've only had this feeling one other time in my life, where it was, you 
[01:24:30]  get this weird, you have a queasy feeling, and you're like, I'm gonna throw up.  And you pull down a pair of panties and found something else?  No, and I didn't find something else.  Oh, oh, okay.  I was disappointed.  Because I always forget.  Yeah, it said fully functional.  And, uh, I stood up, and I'm like, let me just walk for a second.  And my whole body started to tingle.  And I'm like, I'm gonna faint.  I'm gonna pass out.  Wow.  I had to get a water and sit down on the stove, because I started to, like, go.  I could feel myself starting to get ready to pass out. 
[01:25:00]  Just from watching a video of this.  I think I hadn't eaten all day, either.  Like, I, it was just, it's such a visceral...  Can I jump in for one second?  So you get that feeling, and you go and get the water.  So why would you now sit back down and continue watching the video?  Oh, you didn't?  I couldn't.  I mean, I had already seen it one of the time before.  And I don't know why you watch, like...  I can't do it to myself.  To connect.  I don't know why.  It's not a thrill.  It's not like, um...  That's...  I don't know why I watch stuff like that.  That's like in the movies, when they try to dramatize or portray somebody being killed, 
[01:25:30]  and then there's somebody standing in the background watching,  and they turn around and just hurl.  You know?  You can't watch that without a physical reaction to the disgust that you're seeing.  And these three scumbags were from families of wealth.  Yeah, of course.  They were three rich kids who admitted that they were doing it for the thrill.  It was a hobby.  They wanted to have cool memories when they got older. 
[01:26:00]  Jesus.  That's what they're saying?  Yeah.  And that's why they did it.  And they started on cats, and they said that they would offer rides to people.  But the guy being killed, he's just laying in the woods, and he's wearing a suit jacket.  And he's not really moving.  They had obviously beaten him.  And then his face is bloody.  But it's so awful.  They're jabbing him with an ice pick, and it's terrible.  It's just a terrible, terrible thing.  But now that they're starting to become world news now...  I saw this a couple days ago for the first time. 
[01:26:30]  And now you Google it, and it's coming up more and more.  Death penalty.  But not even the death penalty.  It's almost like it's crazy as Islam is sometimes.  I would love to just see what the death penalty people say about this one.  What does it take for you to agree that we need a death penalty?  Aren't they a little more strict in the Ukraine about things like that?  But I'm just saying as a human being, because you know there's people in America where it's different.  They would still fight that these guys don't deserve the death penalty.  I don't understand that one.  Here, here in this country, obviously. 
[01:27:00]  But to those people, what does it take for you to understand that some of these people don't deserve to walk this earth?  These are guys...  Like, I saw that one video where they had a pit that had fire in, and they lit these guys.  They put these gas on these guys.  They just pushed them backwards on their knees into a pit.  That's the only way to handle guys like this.  Absolutely.  Wow.  It's the most...  I literally almost fainted watching a video.  I can't believe I got that reaction.  And Matt in Queensbury felt the same way watching B-Headings.  I see I've never...  I can't watch them. 
[01:27:30]  Nope.  Nope.  I completely understand what's going on.  I don't need to see the videos.  That's just something I just can't deal with.  But with the internet, it's amazing.  It's something I never would have sought out, but it's there, and you watch it, and it's like...  I don't know.  I wish I knew why I did it.  I really don't get a thrill out of this.  I don't think...  I don't know.  Those Ukraines are crazy, though.  It should just be, you know...  We, the jury, find the defendant guilty. 
[01:28:00]  We, the jury, find this defendant guilty.  Let's just get rid of them.  Then a little of this.  That's what they do, and then on their way.  And they move on.  Jimmy, I've got to ask you.  So you start your surfing.  Do they still use the word surfing?  Sure.  And you ended up there.  I like to call it cruising on the information superhighway.  That's futuristic.  Where did you start?  And it's obvious where you ended, because I don't think you see videos after that.  I don't think you, like, keep your surfing going. 
[01:28:30]  Well, I go to the one...  But you went online to do what to begin with?  I was online, I think...  Pay some bills, maybe, and then...  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  You know what I mean?  I'm like, where'd you start, and then you ended up here?  Checking emails and stuff.  I think I was checking emails.  Mm-hmm.  And, you know, whatever I was doing, and then just, you know, I've been in a weird funk  for a little while, so I was just kind of keeping busy.  And I go to this one site where I look at these gore videos, and I wish I didn't know  the name of the site.  That's why I won't give the name out.  And this new one was updated, and the guy put it, it's the most graphic, gruesome video. 
[01:29:00]  The beheadings are bad.  But, Jimmy, I don't...  Like, all right, you know there's gore video websites.  It doesn't mean you have to go there and watch this stuff.  I know.  I know they're out there.  I know.  I don't know why you feel compelled to watch it.  I don't either.  I know where I could go, and I just don't want to or need to.  But other people do watch this, and I don't know...  You're not alone.  Look at the phones.  They're lit.  A million people have seen these videos.  I just choose not to.  What is it that makes you go there?  The same thing that makes people slow down at a car accident. 
[01:29:30]  It's almost like...  Someone told me, because I asked, why do they do that?  And someone told me one time it was an instinct in you to want to see what happened to the other  creature, like the other person, to avoid it.  It's kind of something you don't think through rationally, like an animal looking at another  animal who's wounded.  I don't know exactly.  I wish I knew.  Maybe a psychologist knows.  Does your hand start shaking on the mouse at least?  Like, oh, God, I think I'm going to do this again.  I think I'm going to click on this video. 
[01:30:00]  No, it's just they're there.  Wow.  They're horrible.  And I find myself so empathetic.  Like, it didn't make me harsher.  It actually made me a lot more empathetic towards other people, because you picture  yourself in that horrible, horrible place, the hopelessness those people feel.  And it's just, I felt tremendous empathy for those people.  Horrible.  Yeah, of course.  Wow.  I'm sorry to wreck the show.  Have other people seen it?  I mean, I know the phones are lit.  Chris from PA, I want to hear how the video ends. 
[01:30:30]  Maybe the guy stands up and goes, ta-da.  Yeah.  Do we get a ta-da at the end of this video?  Chris?  Hey, boys.  Yeah, I watched the video through, and at the end, when you think the guy's dead, he's  laying there with an ice pick in his eye, he actually reaches up to pull it out.  Like, he's just laying there motionless, and then he reaches up at the last minute to  pull this thing out.  It was horrific.  I felt the same way that Jimmy did, but I couldn't stop watching it.  What do you mean?  The guy, the dead, almost dead guy, reaches up and pulls the ice pick out of his own eyeball?  He can't reach it. 
[01:31:00]  Well, he makes an attempt.  Oh, he makes a little attempt.  He was almost paralyzed.  He couldn't move.  The hard part for me to watch it was that they had bludgeoned him with something, and  there was a breathing.  He couldn't breathe.  He was like...  It was this fighting for breath.  breath, and these monsters, they show one of these kids in the video, like, looking  and laughing, and...  It's the way they laugh.  It's...  And then afterwards... 
[01:31:30]  There's so many sound.  They run out to the car, and they, like, pour this solution or whatever, this water, on  the hammer.  Yeah.  It's just...  Wow.  It's awful.  All right.  Thank you, Chris.  No problem later.  Hey, just some real, like, people you just pretty much can't relate to out there.  You know?  It's completely unrelatable.  I just want to, like, change gears.  Like, I'm really mad about this Oprah personal struggle thing.  Now GMA's got Gayle King to discuss Oprah's personal struggle. 
[01:32:00]  Look.  Why are they trying to make us feel sorry for a billionaire?  But wait, wait.  The timing is horrendous for this.  No one...  Everyone's losing their jobs.  We don't give a crap Oprah's gaining weight.  But why do they have a washing machine and a stove behind them on the set?  What's that about?  It's probably the two of the things Oprah ate.  A couple of the things they took out of her mansion because they knew she was going to  eat those next.  This isn't...  But does anyone else understand the timing?  Oprah puts their big fat ass on the cover of her magazine to tell everyone that she can't 
[01:32:30]  control her weight?  People are losing their jobs.  I'm a fat pig.  That's news?  No.  You're a billionaire.  That's why.  Then quit your stupid TV show and take care of yourself.  She's got a gym at home.  She's afraid of it or something.  Yeah.  We learned that she's afraid to work out.  How about that, huh?  She's got personal trainers.  She's got personal chefs. 
[01:33:00]  She's got everything you could ask for.  No one wants to hear about your dumb struggle.  And why does GMA like humor this story and have Gayle King on to discuss it further?  I don't get it.  Her friend.  Her good friend.  Right.  Aren't they just friends?  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  That's what I hear.  Yeah, no.  They're just friends.  There might be other friends, though.  Yeah.  Or another friend.  Another friend?  There might just be.  Mm-mm-mm-mm. 
[01:33:30]  Everyone needs friends, right?  You should just stick to that.  No calories.  It's a good workout.  She makes your neck hurt in the morning, but...  She's out of touch.  These dumb housewives will just, you know, gobble up whatever Oprah, you know, feeds them.  Yeah.  They'll all buy the magazine to read about Oprah's struggles, the billionaire's struggles.  My struggle.  Yeah, people are wondering how they're going to pay their bills for December, Oprah.  How about you discuss that in your magazine? 
[01:34:00]  She can't relate.  Another me, me, me, me, me person.  Yeah.  All right.  We're going to clear the field.  Oprah.  We're going to take a very quick break.  Then we're going to do the complaint call.  It's calling Gay today.  And some listener thinks that we invented this and just went off on us.  She's very offended by it.  Yeah.  And we're going to play it right after the break, just in case you missed it.  We started the show off with this.  And we also got some great brand-new Taser videos. 
[01:34:30]  Ooh.  And, of course, we'll play the audio for you.  And I think the videos will be up on onaradio.com.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  We're trying to figure out if Pam Anderson is still hot.  Nope.  No, not really.  I say nope.  Is that her now?  Yeah.  Worn out.  Worn.  We're looking at pictures over.  She's aight. 
[01:35:00]  She's aight.  Anthony, another quiz.  Damn.  Los Angeles critics choose what movie as best movie of the year?  Oh, God.  I haven't even been out to see any of these crap movies.  It wasn't a good year for movies.  I mean, I know Batman.  And critics?  Came out.  Oh, it's the best movie.  What'd they choose?  I don't know what either of them.  Wall.  Really? 
[01:35:30]  A movie I haven't seen yet.  I hear it's really, really good.  Yeah.  And I'm a fan of the animations.  I like those computer animation movies.  I'm a big fan of those.  Huh?  I never liked them.  One thing, I was watching Charlotte's Web, and I had to turn it off because I was crying.  Oh, which one?  The original?  No, the new one.  Oh.  A little pig talking.  Yeah.  Charlotte dies in that one.  I know.  That's why I couldn't watch it.  Yeah.  But then the little spiders go, bye, goodbye.  They all fly away.  I don't know. 
[01:36:00]  The baby spiders.  Thanks for spoiling it.  I ain't ruining the ending and everything like that.  My favorite movie of the year was Iron Man.  Have you seen Iron Man yet?  I was watching Iron Man last night, haven't seen it, first time I was watching it, and  unfortunately I did fall asleep.  Really?  But it was not for lack of excitement and adventure in that movie.  Did you like it?  I was just exhausted, tired.  I thought it was really cool.  Yeah.  That friggin', when they first show him in that, the new suit. 
[01:36:30]  Oh, yeah.  After, you know, the one he made.  The old suit was kind of cool, though.  Very cool.  You didn't think it could get cooler is what you're saying.  But then the new one he got out, oh, man, that was pretty cool.  It blows Batman away.  I know everyone talks about Heath Ledger, and, you know, the guy was brilliant in that  movie as the Joker, but as far as the movie goes, Iron Man blows the Batman movie away.  When he took out the first camp, he was using the people as human shields. 
[01:37:00]  Oh, yeah.  All those people using, the soldiers using the civilians as human shields, and he just  targets them all in the head and just froop.  So where did you leave off with the movie?  I don't know.  You ever fall asleep during the movie, and you're kind of not really sure.  With movies I've seen, I know exactly.  Like, if Alien is on and I'm falling asleep, I'll know exactly when I fall asleep.  Exactly.  But this one, I wasn't quite sure.  I got to tell you, Iron Man wins in the end, Ant.  I'll watch it.  Oh, does he? 
[01:37:30]  Of course he does.  Am I giving anything away?  I know.  They want the big sequel.  I thought Robert Downey there was really good.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I thought he was good in it.  He's good in everything he effing does.  He's just so, you know, screwed up.  Not as much, though, they say, right?  He's got his life figured out.  Yeah, supposedly.  But, yeah, no, I liked it.  I liked it.  I thought it was pretty cool.  You want to continue?  I saw. 
[01:38:00]  You want to continue with your quiz?  I didn't know it was Anthony Quiz Day, but of course.  Well, Jimmy, you want in on the quiz?  I love quizzes.  All right.  It's legendary how much I love quizzes.  All right.  And you've got to raise your hand if you know the answer ahead of time.  I don't want cheaters today.  All right.  I know you have your pal talk pals that help you out at every turn, but not today.  No, no, no.  Not today.  I'm not looking for that.  All right.  Don't look at instant feedback.  Nothing.  11-year-old Jiffy, a border collie dog, can crawl, but it's too heavy to walk, and the 
[01:38:30]  extra 50 pounds he's carrying nearly cost him his life.  Do I have to ask the question?  What is it he's carrying?  No.  Like, why did it, you know, nearly cost him his life?  Because he's fat?  It's a fat dog?  Well, how did the fat get in the way?  Of the dog?  This is a high-level question, by the way.  Rolled over on his back and couldn't turn over?  I don't even get this, though. 
[01:39:00]  I'm not getting enough information.  You've got a dog, 50 pounds overweight, nearly cost him his life.  Not every question is going to be an easy one.  Heart disease.  That's your answer?  Heart disease?  I have no clue.  Can't go to the bathroom?  Fat dog was trying to cross the street and a glacier almost hit him?  I love exaggerated humor.  Could I ever tell you?  I'm a big fan of the exaggerated humor.  But that's not possible, Jimmy. 
[01:39:30]  Wow.  Boy.  This is going to be a hard one.  I understand.  Yeah.  And it was fat.  And it could have cost him his life.  Oh, he couldn't get his head up to the bowl to eat?  No.  They cost him his life.  Locks of his hair are still frozen on the sidewalk in front of his house, where he got  stuck for more than 12 hours. 
[01:40:00]  Ah, you stupid fat dog.  His belly's rubbing up along the sidewalk, and his belly froze to the sidewalk.  Ew.  Because he was too fat.  Fat, dumb dog.  Where he got stuck for more than 12 hours.  It is very disturbing to see a dog that overweight, and then to actually come up and see the dog  frozen to the sidewalk was very, very traumatic for me.  I've never seen a dog actually frozen to a sidewalk before.  No one has.  Animal care providers had to use warm water. 
[01:40:30]  No one's ever seen that anywhere in the world.  Ever, no.  It's never happened.  Ever.  The last time I saw a fat dog stuck to the sidewalk, I felt just as bad.  Yeah.  She asked like it was something we were all talking about at one point.  I've never seen the skydiving dogs, and apparently here they are.  Animal care providers had to use warm water to gently pry the dog free, and Jiffy's owner,  a 59-year-old woman, was taken into custody on suspicion of animal neglect.  Of course, you dunce.  Yeah. 
[01:41:00]  Thomas Overbeck from Dallas writes,  Did the dog break his knee and ask someone to hold his paw?  Man.  Damn it.  Did you see the dog laying out there?  Yes, I did.  You know, I tried to help her with it on Friday night, but I got bit by it, so I left it alone.  She had other people come and help, and everybody did make an effort.  Was hungry, all frozen there at the sidewalk.  Other people come and help, and everybody did make an effort.  You know, it's not that it was total neglect, it's not her fault, you know. 
[01:41:30]  The owners tell police, she did make frequent trips outside to check on the dog,  but folks here at the Sheboygan County Humane Society suggest the dog was abused long before he was frozen.  If you can overfeed a dog, and when you do, that's what happens.  The dog becomes extremely overweight.  It cannot move properly.  It puts a strain on all of their organs.  It's just not healthy.  It's abuse.  That's plain and simple.  Yes, and apparently it just wrote an article in its magazine  about how much trouble it's having with the weight. 
[01:42:00]  I feel the same about those pills.  Exactly.  That's a fun little human interest story, right?  That's one of these, thank God that woman, well, I don't know if she has children, I doubt it,  but it's one of those women that would just do that to her kids.  Oh, yeah.  You know, something Munchausen syndrome by proxy or whatever it is. 
[01:42:30]  I'm tasting peanut butter.  What?  Yeah.  After a dog story?  Yeah, really?  Yeah, well, you should have waited before I said this.  I'm tasting peanut butter, and I haven't eaten peanut butter in the last couple of days.  You're having a stroke?  I smell oranges.  I smell burning hair.  It's tasty peanut butter, too.  Have a taste.  Come on here.  Here you go.  I just cleaned out my food pocket for you, Jimmy. 
[01:43:00]  All right.  Oh, God.  What?  Food pocket.  Yeah.  Didn't you fix that yet?  Yeah, have that fill.  I'm going back to the dentist.  I'm having it filled because I've had it.  I have some cement put in there.  Does it stink?  Does it stink?  It's, I don't know.  It can't not.  Food pocket.  It's full of food.  It's a pocket.  They had to tell me how to food pocket.  Isn't it just a hole in your gum?  I don't know.  It's a, yeah, it's a pocket where food goes. 
[01:43:30]  It gets stuck, and it's hard to keep clean.  Why don't you eat cement, and then it'll get in there and harden and problem solved?  Yeah.  So it's calling gay day.  Yes.  And we had a dummy.  We started promoting this or talking about this, whatever, yesterday.  And after the show, this lady calls in to Stuntbrain's voicemail and left this message.  Hi, Mike.  My name is Marcy. 
[01:44:00]  I'm a listener of your station.  Occasionally, I catch the Andy and Opie show in the morning, but rarely, because I'm at work.  We get it, barely.  You don't want to be associated with this program.  The Andy and Opie show.  Yeah.  She's really familiar with this program.  But she'll try to ruin the show for everybody else.  Andy.  A lot of these people out there.  Because I'm at work.  I just happened to hear an advertisement on your station for the Andy and Opie show, which  I think is something that's going to be occurring tomorrow. 
[01:44:30]  It's something called Call in Gay Day.  I have to tell you, I find this so incredibly offensive, sexist, and against every human right imaginable.  Thank you.  That's what we're trying.  I just want to express my deep disappointment in your programming, allowing these two people  to promote this on the air. 
[01:45:00]  And it continues the hatred and the disaster that this entire world is in.  That's what...  The entire world is in a disaster right now?  Really?  Because of the Andy and Opie show.  I see Christmas lights.  How disastrous could it be?  Beautiful.  I'm doing the la-la-la-la.  La-la-la.  Oh, my God.  Where's the disaster?  I hate that song. 
[01:45:30]  I called in gay, got a mouthful of la-la-la-la-la.  Sat down and got a la-la-la-la.  La-la-la-la-la-la-la.  I would appreciate a callback.  I will be writing a letter to the director of your company, to the director of Proverbs,  Can we give out the address so everyone can write their dumb letters?  Which one?  Get one that isn't fired or going to be fired.  They won't care about your letter.  I'm the director of your company, to the director of programming. 
[01:46:00]  I'm not quite sure what your title is.  But thank you for listening to this message, and hopefully I'll be able to talk to you  in person, because I just can't let this rest.  I'm not gay, but I really don't have any gay friends.  But I know, when I hear something offensive, and this is deeply, deeply offensive to every  human being.  Thank you. 
[01:46:30]  Thank you.  Do you honestly...  Even if we made up calling gay, it would not be deeply offensive to every human being.  How is it offensive?  You dummy.  How?  The thing is, it's like, this woman's not the problem.  She's a great window into the way the country thinks, which is a knee-jerk reaction to something  that they're not informed about, thinking for other people, and thinking that I'm supposed  to feel a certain way about something because of that knee-jerk reaction.  Like, it's got to be offensive, and it's sexist. 
[01:47:00]  It's like, first of all, it doesn't mention gender.  Sexism implies, I believe, gender, not sex.  Right, right.  It's like all of these incorrect things.  It's just, uh, it's silly.  And we're trying to get her on the phone, but what?  You know what's funny?  She gave her work number, and she's not answering her work number.  Why would she?  Well, maybe she starts at nine, but I mean, a lot of people start at eight.  Right?  So we're trying to get her on the air.  Uh, she thinks it's offensive. 
[01:47:30]  And do you think any idiot...  Oh, sorry.  Yes, Travis.  But Travis ran in.  I'm on the phone.  Okay.  What line?  Uh, she, she's on line four.  Cool.  She can't hear right now.  Okay.  But I'm going to put her on.  Okay.  Go right to her.  And she's willing to talk to you.  All right, cool.  She still has no idea.  All right, good.  Okay.  Let's not do something where we just say hi and hang up.  All right.  I really want to hear...  Put her on hold.  Her, uh, logic.  I think you should talk nicely to her, and then let her get it all off her chest, and then 
[01:48:00]  reveal that you were just reporting what gay people wanted to do today.  Yeah.  Make her sound like...  And then see how she reacts.  Let's make believe it's our bit still.  Well, let's...  I want to hear her side in there.  All right, let's go.  And then the big reveal.  Hi.  Hi.  Hello.  Who's this?  This is Marcy Freeman.  Hi, Marcy.  How are you?  Good.  How are you?  We heard you were a little angry at something you heard on the Andy and Opie show. 
[01:48:30]  No, not on your show.  It was on the...  It was, I guess, a promotion for something that was going to be on your show.  Ah.  Well, that would be on our show.  They must have taken a clip and then put it on, so later on, when you were listening  to music, you heard this clip from our program, which is actually, if I may, the Opie and Anthony 
[01:49:00]  show.  I know.  I know.  I realized that after when I was doing some research on the internet.  I said, oh, no.  Oh, you got the research done.  Right.  Yes, yes.  So?  That shows, really, I don't really listen to your program, but I heard the little blurb.  Right, right.  I was really...  Now, I have to ask you, because I wasn't quite understanding you. 
[01:49:30]  What were you so upset about with what you heard?  Um, it was call-in gay day, I believe.  Right.  And it was, um, if the...  I wasn't sure if this was supposed to happen today or whenever.  Today.  Um, okay.  Um, okay.  Um, but, um, from what I heard, it was, if you call in, if someone should happen to call 
[01:50:00]  in today and not report for work, the following day...  Excuse me.  The following day, people would, um, laugh at them at the water cooler because they would  be gay.  That was my interpretation of what I heard.  If, if somebody, let's say somebody, uh, did, do you know what this is based on?  Do you know why we were even discussing this?  No.  No. 
[01:50:30]  All right.  You were, but, but you were, you were all ready to fire off a letter to our boss, um,  without even knowing where this, this came from, do you, I, I want to, I want to enlighten  you a little bit.  Um, do you know that today is call-in gay day and it isn't a radio bit?  Do you, do you understand that the gay community came up with this to show that they have some  type of purchasing power and, uh, to show that they're, uh, they're, um, uh, useful members 
[01:51:00]  of society that run businesses and that if they take the day off, that people will  notice, uh, and it shows that they're, they have some power in this country.  It was, uh, uh, thought up by the gay community.  This isn't some bit that we came up with.  Did you know that?  No, I didn't know that.  All right.  So you didn't know that.  Hold on, hold on.  Let me just keep, keep, uh, continuing with my, my questions on it.  So you didn't know that you heard a blurb from our show, uh, a promotional clip that's 
[01:51:30]  played during the rest of the day to get people to try to listen to our show.  And based on that alone, you threatened to write a letter to our bosses.  So we would be reprimanded with, with less than 1%, I would say of the, the facts of what  was actually happening.  Do you think that is a, a sound and logical?  Well, I think that, um, when a station runs an advertisement for something, it's usually, 
[01:52:00]  you know, includes all the information.  Like say they were advertising, uh, I don't know, dishwashing liquid or something like that.  Um, I can only go by what I heard and that's what I heard.  You heard it.  Um, it was taken out of context because, uh, obviously for a promo for the, the program, 
[01:52:30]  we can't, we can't spell it out for everybody.  It's supposed to be a quick, uh, uh, thing that grabs your attention.  Um, but it, but to, to base a letter that could possibly get a show in, in trouble, um,  maybe sponsors, uh, would be upset, uh, the bosses on something that you are obviously  ill-informed on.  You, you don't know the whole story here.  Yeah, but why would you have to worry if everybody knows what the true story is except me? 
[01:53:00]  I'm not worried.  I'm saying, I'm not, believe me, I'm not worried.  Our bosses are worried about flying out the door, uh, with pink slips.  Uh, your letter would do nothing.  It would end up in the garbage in two seconds because the, the, the guys with the ties that  would read it maybe two years ago and give it some credence, they're flying out the door  in record numbers getting fired because the economy stinks on ice and, and you, you're  listening to a, a, a blurb from our show and ready to fire off a letter. 
[01:53:30]  It's beyond me that you are going to be the voice of, of the people that listen to radio  and, uh, you know, try to get, uh, us reprimanded for something that you didn't even understand.  Well, number one, I'm not the voice of people who listen to radio.  Well, you certainly sounded like it by saying, you know, uh, you, you were, you were putting  your voice to everyone else saying this offends everybody. 
[01:54:00]  You know, you did say that, that this, oh, this is offensive to everybody.  How do you know?  I would have to see my letter to see exactly what I said.  Well, you, you did say it's offensive to everybody.  What gives you the right to say that you speak for everybody?  You know, a lot of people aren't, even if we meant it with malice, which we didn't, we  were reporting on what was, uh, happening in, in the gay community.  But even if we meant it with malice, with humor behind it, uh, you, you, you don't understand 
[01:54:30]  it.  You, you, you still don't have the right to speak for everybody.  You're very good.  You should be a lawyer.  Can I ask her one question?  Just curiosity.  Anthony has very eloquently explained what it was, what was happening.  And what I'm hearing from you is things like, um, well, the promo should have been more informative  and Hey, I don't speak for anybody.  It's like, why not just say, wow, I was wrong. 
[01:55:00]  Like, why is there no personal responsibility?  Like, you know what?  I overreacted.  I should have done a little more research.  I should have been informed before I complained.  Like, you know what I'm saying?  Like, why wouldn't, instead of thinking of all these other things, you just come out and  admit like, Hey, I was ill-informed.  And I guess when I complained to a company, I should be informed of the facts.  Well, do I have a second to answer some of these things?  Okay.  Um, number one, it was a promo period. 
[01:55:30]  Number two, if I knew these, and I'm going to have to refer to them as alleged facts because  I've, um, been in touch with some gay organizations and I would, I would like to know if this is  a true thing because, um, in the years that I worked in, um, as a social worker, I've never  heard of this.  Well, let me tell you something then, you know something, let me tell you something. 
[01:56:00]  You're, you're, you're uninformed.  You're not very informed, especially in your line of work.  If you say that, uh, it's right here.  Gays, uh, nups, backers, skip work today.  The first ever day without gay aims to show the nation relies on homosexuals and, uh, raise  awareness of the drive to legalize gay and lesbian unions.  And this is from a little rag that no one reads called the New York daily news.  Uh, it's been on all the news stations. 
[01:56:30]  Uh, you're a social worker and you're, you're that uninformed with, with, with what's going  on in this country.  Do you, do you just finish my, my, go ahead, go ahead, go ahead.  Okay.  Regardless of that information, the way the blurb came through was if you call in gay on  this day, people will laugh at you because they'll think you're gay. 
[01:57:00]  No, the thing is, if not, if you call in gay, let's say you're legitimately sick and everyone  in the office knows it's calling gay day and you're one of these man's men and then you  call in sick because you are sick and then you come in the next day and everybody starts  going, Hey, you know, that's a brave thing you did yesterday, not showing up, uh, and,  and showing your support.  Uh, I never knew you were gay, but that's cool.  That is how we placed it in a humorous manner because don't you think that would be kind 
[01:57:30]  of funny that some guy doesn't know it's calling gay day.  He's really sick.  He goes in, this is called comedy, Marcy.  It's called humor.  It's called like, um, some kind of, uh, uh, weird position.  The guy was put in it's, it, do you understand that, that it's not offensive, that it's humor  based on some type of miscommunication that was going on?  Do you understand that?  And gays could handle some humor by the way.  If the guy is put in a weird position, then, uh, isn't there some, isn't there a question 
[01:58:00]  mark there?  No, it's an imaginary guy that we made up for a bit for some kind of discussion.  That would be an ironic, weird twist of a situation that the guy's actually sick.  He's not gay, but the fact that it's calling gay day, everyone thinks he's gay or the guy  that is sick, that drags himself into work because he's sick, because he doesn't want  people to think he's gay. 
[01:58:30]  We had one of those.  Is that, is that, is that, is that terrible?  Why is that terrible?  It's called funny.  People should not think, people should not think you're gay.  But, but, but, you know something, there are people that do.  You're so terrified of being sort of as gay that you drag yourself into work.  Right.  That's the humor of the whole thing.  But, but Marcy, you don't think there are people out there that think like that?  Of course there are.  Yes.  All right.  So what's the, that's.  You're having fun with those types of people.  That's where the humor comes from.  Do you think that's gay?  Do you think us.  I don't think it's funny, but that's okay. 
[01:59:00]  Of course not.  No, it's not okay because you wrote a letter.  You should just realize this show isn't for you and just move on.  Right, right.  If, if it's not funny.  I wasn't listening to the show.  I was listening to the music.  Did you or did you not send off your letter?  I'm sorry, I couldn't, I couldn't hear that.  Did you or did you not send off your letter?  Yes.  Why?  Do you realize people enjoy this show and if it's not for you, so it's not for you.  There's other people that really enjoy what we do.  It's not the show.  Of course it's the show.  It is the show.  If it's a promo for the show. 
[01:59:30]  It was a blurb about the show.  Exactly.  But do you honestly think our boss is going to read that letter and then get upset with  the guy that placed the blurb of the show or the people that did the show?  Do you, do you, first of all, like I said, like I said, this has nothing to do with us  getting in trouble.  Your letter, I swear to you, will end up in the garbage because people are worried just  about keeping their jobs in this day and age.  A few months back, you might have gotten some mileage from this, but I'll be honest with  you, your letter's going to get nothing. 
[02:00:00]  And it's just a stupid letter.  It's a stupid attempt at trying to get somebody in trouble and being so uninformed and then  firing off a letter.  You are so much more irresponsible than a show that is trying to be funny, cutting edge, comedy,  dark, comedy, whatever you want to call it, but you, Missy, are probably being a lot more  irresponsible than you believe we were by saying what we did by firing off an uninformed, 
[02:00:30]  unresearched letter.  Well, thank you, gentlemen, for your opinion.  Well, it's not an opinion.  It's not an opinion.  Before you hang up, we would really appreciate an apology because you really, you know, got  under our skin today.  Yes.  Well, let's put it this way.  We would appreciate an apology.  I think it's due because we would appreciate an apology. 
[02:01:00]  I don't think I have to apologize.  Why don't you think an apology, why do you think an apology isn't in line when you said  yourself, you didn't research this.  It was taken completely out of context.  You wrote a letter.  You don't think you don't take it out of context.  You should.  This is something that your radio program put on the air.  They are responsible for what goes on the air.  You should apologize for it.  You understand what I'm saying?  Marcy, yes.  And that's completely legitimate.  It falls within every single guideline that we have to adhere to. 
[02:01:30]  Do you understand that?  Even out of context, it falls within every single guideline we have to adhere to.  And you didn't even get it.  You didn't even get the point of it.  You didn't get the humor in it.  You didn't even understand that the gays came up with this day.  I used to enjoy the Howard Stern show.  I listened to it every day.  And then what happened?  Then what happened?  Well, then he went to the other station.  And then what happened? 
[02:02:00]  And then I stopped listening.  Why?  You know.  Why?  Because there really wasn't.  Because I thought Howard was funny.  Was funny, but then you decided he wasn't anymore?  No.  He went to the pay station.  And you didn't feel he was funny enough.  I don't want to pay.  You didn't feel he was funny enough to pay for.  No, I don't want to pay for radio.  I really don't listen to it.  I enjoy music rather than.  And you weren't offended and firing off letters by things he said?  Not at all. 
[02:02:30]  He was a funny guy.  About gays or anything like that?  You didn't find anything offensive?  You didn't find that he was demeaning to women?  No.  Some of the things he did?  You're just a dope.  By getting a naked woman to stand there and throw baloney at her?  No.  You didn't find that offensive?  Not at all.  Why?  Why?  Because I thought he was funny and I thought he was an idiot.  But, um...  Yeah, but you don't know anything about us, but you're quick to write the old letter and  send it out in the mail, you dope. 
[02:03:00]  You sound like two really intelligent guys.  You don't sound like Howard Stern.  Wrong again.  Can I ask how many...  Marcy, can I ask how many gay organizations did you contact?  Um, I think it was the Long Island gay youth community and then, um, there was the, uh...  Cherry Grove?  Whatever it was.  I'm listening to you now and this is what I'm getting from you.  It is this unreasonable... 
[02:03:30]  And I'm actually glad that you're saying what you're saying and despite being presented  with what you're being presented with, you are still holding on to the fact that you  are correct to spend the energy you did and spend the time you did and to do what you  did.  You're a great example of what's happening in the country.  Everybody knee-jerk reacts and then just refuses to take personal responsibility for  being off the mark.  The idea of admitting, hey, wow, I overreacted. 
[02:04:00]  I was completely wrong is sociopathically unconnected to you right now.  And I don't comprehend that.  You're unable to accept responsibility that you were wrong in this instance.  Yeah.  Just like, hey, I screwed up.  Because I've said a lot of things.  I bet about 500 like every other person in the country.  And instead of just realizing you thought you heard something, you heard it wrong because  you were ill-informed and you're wrong.  You're 100% wrong.  You keep trying to find reasons why you're right.  So, Marcy, you should really apologize to us. 
[02:04:30]  No, no.  I'm not trying to find reasons that I'm right.  Well, you are.  I'm just trying to explain something.  You explained your point.  You explained your point.  I think I'm not being heard.  I think the program deserves an apology from you.  Yeah, I really do.  For basing what you did on zero facts.  There's obviously some...  Well, you know what?  I'll call you up and I'll apologize.  No, no, no.  When I find out whether or not this whole gay thing is true, because I have no facts except  for your word for it. 
[02:05:00]  Fair enough.  Do you have a computer by you, Marcy?  Yes, I do.  Well, how about this?  Let's be fair.  She wants to check the facts.  Understandable.  It's the first time she's doing this with the fact checking.  So, let's be happy she's making the effort.  Google, Google, day without a gay.  Google that.  Google day without a gay.  Day without a gay.  Go ahead.  We'll wait.  It's okay.  Obviously, you know how to type, you're joking.  All right.  Okay.  Now, what's coming up?  You got dial-up? 
[02:05:30]  No, I'm typing with one hand.  Believe me, I live like that.  I'm holding the phone together.  Very good, Jimmy.  Okay, day without a gay.  Okay.  You could actually go to daywithoutagay.org.  Dot org.  Yes, yes.  Click on that.  And this, by the way, will confirm that this is a genuine day  that was put together by gay people 
[02:06:00]  to show that they have buying power.  They have power in the retail community  and will show an impact if they decide not to go out and go to work today.  And can I, Marcy, can I gently correct you on one thing?  You were saying that, well, the blurb that came on the radio  was what you heard, what you said, so that's all I'm responsible for.  When you're making a complaint and you're calling people,  you're now passing on facts, 
[02:06:30]  you are responsible for a little more than that.  If you're going to try to make an action happen  and take action and make effort,  you're responsible to know what you're talking about.  Absolutely, Jimmy.  The show is not responsible to spoon-feed all information.  You're responsible, if you're going to react and take offense to it,  to know what you're talking about.  To do the research, right.  Especially when it comes to a promo for a show.  You know, it's a very limited time that the programming during the day  has to get the point across that there's a morning show, 
[02:07:00]  here's what they do,  and if you're upset by that, do a little more research.  Now, what are you seeing on your computer there, Missy?  Well, my name is Marcy, not Missy.  Oh, sorry about that.  Okay.  I don't know who I'm speaking to.  No, it's Missy.  It's Missy.  I'll have to do some research to make sure it's Marcy.  Yeah, we don't know for sure.  I don't know.  You're telling me, but what do I know?  What does it say?  Well, there's various information here about calling a gay day. 
[02:07:30]  I don't know exactly what you want me to tell you.  All right, so where's our apology?  It is a legitimate gay-initiated day, right?  Apparently.  Not apparently.  It is.  It is.  Can you just for a second accept the goddamn responsibility  and say it is, for that day, a gay organization that put this together?  God damn it.  Their logo looks a lot like the Howard Stern logo, by the way. 
[02:08:00]  It certainly does.  Wow.  My goodness.  You see how unreasonable you're being?  You see how it's almost childlike, the way you're holding on to the idea with the soft language.  Well, apparently.  No, there's no apparently.  It is.  Get it off your shoulders.  Take responsibility.  Take a breath.  That's right.  Give us a little apology.  We'll all feel better about ourselves.  Marcy.  Just, you know.  A little apology.  Apologize for your rash decision-making, and then we'll move on with our lives. 
[02:08:30]  Right.  Can I ask a question?  Sure.  First?  Sure.  Do you feel like you won't be able to move on unless I apologize?  Yes, because, you know something, it's all we have to grasp onto at this point.  You've done the damage that you've done already.  Hey, the letters in the mail, you know, it's going to go to the boss.  We may have to explain this.  I don't know.  But you put us in that position for something you did not research.  And why wouldn't you want to apologize? 
[02:09:00]  The only thing we have is the fact that you now have looked up something.  You find that you weren't correct on it.  You may be getting us chastised.  And the only thing we have to latch onto is an apology from this Marcy woman.  Right.  Okay.  Well, all I can tell you is that...  You can't do it, can't you?  Yes, no, yes, I can.  I'm thinking about how I want to word this. 
[02:09:30]  I'm a lawyer.  The issue for me was not what you want to put on your show or what your humor is, because, as anybody says, either you want to listen to it or you don't want to listen to it.  The only issue was how it was presented in the blurb.  It doesn't matter how it was presented in the blurb.  It doesn't matter because you're uninformed.  You're attempting to get us in a lot of trouble with our bosses. 
[02:10:00]  Do the research.  Just give us an apology.  If you hear a news tease...  I can be uninformed about anything that I want to, but if I represent it in such a way as it may cause offense, because if it wasn't presented in a whole different way, I could care less.  I mean, I have more things in my life to do than you could even imagine.  All right.  Can I jump in here for a second?  Yeah, go ahead.  Marcy, hi.  It's Opie.  One of our gay listeners is very, very upset, and they want you to do a little more research. 
[02:10:30]  You still got the Google up?  Yeah.  Let me see what he wrote here.  Could you put meat?  You got it?  M-E-A-T.  Meat?  M-E-A-T, yes.  Okay.  Sorry.  It's another site that is explained.  Oh, www.meatspin.com.  Yeah, Ant's got it, too.  Spin.  That's the one.  That's right.  Is there only one word? 
[02:11:00]  Yeah, one word.  M-E-A-T?  www.meatspin.com.  This is showing how the media spins things.  Yeah.  And they get right to the bottom of the issue.  This will inform you a little more.  All right.  Notice that I'm willing to listen to you.  Uh-huh.  I want you to remember this.  Okay.  You're not willing to say you're sorry, though.  I want you to make it wrong.  I'm having a problem.  What's the problem? 
[02:11:30]  Understanding exactly what the issue was.  Oh, did you go to that website?  It explains it further.  All right.  Now, you just have to spell it for me one more time.  Okay.  And there's no...  It's coming up on Meatspin.com.  Yes.  No, there's no www.  Oh, okay.  I'm sorry.  Just no www, okay?  All right.  Let's take that out.  It's M-E-A-T-S-P-I-N.  All one word.  Yeah.  Dot com. 
[02:12:00]  Dot com.  There you go.  Okay.  This will explain it further.  Because the media...  Trick your friends into coming.  Come see what your mother warned you about.  Is that the website?  Huh?  Why?  What are you talking about?  Yeah.  How dumb is she?  How did you spell that?  Did you...  M-E-A-T-S-P-I-N dot com.  Right.  And what do you say?  One word, right?  It says...  Okay.  Meatspin.com.  You spin me right around, baby. 
[02:12:30]  Right around.  Then underneath it says Meatspin of America.  Come see what your mother warned you about.  Trick your friends into coming.  Forums.  Meatspin.  Redirecting to the new forum.  Maybe you don't have Flash.  A Flash player.  I'm not looking at Flash.  I'm looking right at Google.  Not at Google.  Hey, silly goose.  Hey, silly goose.  We're talking about just put it in the browser.  Yeah.  Not Google.  Yeah.  Because it's the site itself. 
[02:13:00]  Yeah.  There's a lot of sites called Meatspin or...  All right.  No, just...  Click on the first one.  Up top, just go to Meats...  The first one.  Yeah.  The first one.  Yes.  The first one.  Go ahead.  Just click on that.  Because that really explains everything.  Okay.  You just have to give me a minute.  Okay.  It's not coming up.  Yeah.  It's coming up.  Server time out. 
[02:13:30]  Meatspin is taking too long to respond.  It must be overloaded.  Yeah, it must be.  It must be.  Thanks.  Thanks.  Apparently, there's a problem with saying that.  Yeah, yeah.  Okay.  Well, you know something?  After all is said and done here, I really do think...  You're a dummy.  Just an apology, and we're done with this.  Okay?  Can you just do that, Marcy?  And what is it?  Let me apologize for exactly. 
[02:14:00]  No, just apologize for the fact that you made a very uninformed, rash move that could  potentially damage somebody's livelihood.  That's the apology.  Whose livelihood?  Our livelihood.  She is just the worst.  She knows.  Do you understand?  I don't think I...  Do you think I have that much power?  You don't...  Haven't you watched the news?  Apparently, you haven't watched the news.  People have a big...  A lot of power when they just write a letter that is uninformed like that. 
[02:14:30]  Wow.  Sometimes the bosses really take it to heart.  And I do believe, because you did make an uninformed decision to write this letter, that we do  deserve an apology from you.  And then we can move on, Marcy.  That's all.  If you were not promoting anti-gay bias, then I apologize.  Not accepted!  Go, screw!  Go, screw! 
[02:15:00]  Marcy.  Let it be known, we were heading toward a brilliant bit, and two things happened.  Yeah, two things went on there.  Because the dumb listeners had to go check it out for themselves.  Yeah, your listeners are a bunch of dummies.  Which slowed down the internet for that fine website.  Yeah.  And then we got the company here dumping out of the website address.  Because they didn't want us saying it on the air as much. 
[02:15:30]  Oh, who knows?  What's going to happen?  Shut up!  We were this close to brilliance, and we got messed up on a couple levels there.  They heard it on SiriusXM.  Oh, boy, did they.  That thing just spinning around on her...  Whoa!  I'm cursing now.  That thing just spinning around on her computer like a propeller would have just been gold.  Would have been golden.  Yeah, but too much traffic.  Thanks.  Listener's blowing up our show.  We appreciate that.  What an idiot.  And let me just explain to the listeners out there. 
[02:16:00]  That is...  Comedy?  That picture from that website, we're watching it now, it's just hysterical.  It's perfect.  Yeah, it's comedy at its best.  That shows you what we have to deal with a lot doing this kind of radio.  Yeah.  People that are just talking out their crack.  They have no idea what the show is about, what a segment was about, what the real news  is, what we're goofing on, and then they fire off inflammatory letters to our bosses. 
[02:16:30]  Ugh.  Go screw.  I broke a knuckle, too.  I punched the microphone really hard.  Because people like that just frustrate the hell out of me.  It's not that frustrating, but it's actually good to listen to them because you're seeing  a great...  Hang themselves.  But the inability, the stubbornness, the desperate need to be heard, stubbornness of  I'm wrong, I shouldn't have done that, is impossible for people.  And that's why the country... 
[02:17:00]  That's why I must get fired.  That's why so many shows get yanked off the air.  It is because of the public.  That's the mentality of the public.  They're uninformed.  And a lot of these people, if there's one person like her that hears something out of  context or whatever, fires off a letter, just think if she belonged or knew an organization.  Sure.  That then she would tell these people the wrong thing and they send form letters to the bosses.  So now the bosses and the FCC and everyone else are getting a bunch of letters from people 
[02:17:30]  that never heard it and just heard this woman's side of it, which is completely wrong.  It just...  That's what happens to people in radio.  And that's why they get fired.  Absolutely.  Morons like Marcy.  And the fact that the bosses are even dumber because the bosses accept the form letters.  The bosses know better.  They know better and they accept the form letters.  Thank God.  They're truly dummies.  Thank God we're at a point where they just have to worry about getting tossed out the  goddamn door.  That they're not putting any credence into these stupid letters. 
[02:18:00]  And it's important to say that Marcy is big time the minority.  But unfortunately, they have a lot of power at times.  Squeaky wheel gets the grease.  Should we do...  All right.  We're going to do a quick break and wrap up because the phones are lit.  So a quick break and then we'll wrap up the O.P. and Anthony show.  Stay there for a few more minutes.  All right.  We got to wrap up.  We're cutting into 92 minutes of continuous rock.  Or at least, right?  At least 92 minutes of continuous rock.  Can I just finish... 
[02:18:30]  Obviously, the mic went on real quick.  I was saying just...  Jay's on right now.  Jay Leno's being interviewed.  And his hair's got like bedhead, which we think is great.  It's awesome.  What a comic.  Let's go on national TV.  Big news.  Bedhead.  He doesn't care.  He don't care.  But they could not justify letting this guy walk in this economy.  You can't let that much money and the guy who's that powerful in the ratings walk out  the door.  Leno won.  He won.  Conan kind of loses on this one.  That's a big hit for Conan.  I think it's a huge hit on him.  He'll still get his younger demos, but he was looking for the big hit in the ratings. 
[02:19:00]  I mean, everybody checking him out.  But I mean, so Leno's on a 10 on NBC.  So you get the jokes.  You get the current events.  You get the celebrity interviews.  And then you do your local news.  Why would you stick around for the late night shows at that point?  Right?  I think it's a brilliant move.  Yeah.  I mean, they couldn't let Leno go.  We really got to go, but a quickie.  We promised the people we'd have an update on the Butt Bandit.  Hope Marcy isn't listening.  This might be a little saucy, too.  Oh, boy, Marcy. 
[02:19:30]  We're just pirates.  I'm not a bandit.  This is a little weird.  It's out of Nebraska.  The Butt Bandit is going to get 13 months in jail.  13 months in jail.  Where his nickname will not change.  Oh, boy.  More gay humor.  Not good, Anthony.  Marcy's paying close attention.  This is weird, because this is like a fraternity prank, and the guy's going to do it like 13 months in jail.  A man dubbed the Butt Bandit for making, how do you not love this guy, for making greasy imprints of his nether parts on windows in the north-central Nebraska city of Valentine has been sentenced to more than a year in jail. 
[02:20:00]  For that?  Damn.  Were people in the restaurant or whatever?  That's funny.  That's hilarious.  It's a dumb prank.  Cherry County attorney Eric Scott says police caught 35-year-old Thomas Larvey in the act on November 19th.  Are they, there's been other people that have been arrested and charged with a sexual offense because they've mooned, like, school buses and stuff, right? 
[02:20:30]  And then they have to, like, they have to register as a sex offender.  Maybe that's where they're going with this.  Scott says Larvey was sentenced Thursday to 13 and a half months in jail after being convicted of eight misdemeanor counts of public indecency and one of disturbing the peace.  Disturbing the peace.  You know, there are guys, there are guys who probably have committed real sexual crimes, like, 
[02:21:00]  Yeah, they're all lumped in together, of course, or whatever they would do, you know, in front of people that are not getting that kind of time in jail.  No, of course not.  The authority said Larvey used lotion or petroleum jelly to make imprints.  Got to give this guy a raise.  Of his naked behind and sometimes his groin area on the windows of stores, churches, and schools in Valentine beginning in the spring of 2007. 
[02:21:30]  Townspeople, they had fun with this.  They dubbed him the Butt Bandit, even though no theft was involved.  Were people there when he did it or would he do it at night?  I would imagine that, well, it says disturbing the peace.  One, disturbing of the peace.  So maybe he thought no one was around and they were.  It sounds like he was doing this, you know, yeah, when everyone went home for the day.  So, there's the update on the Butt Bandit.  Just for leaving greasy milk. 
[02:22:00]  Yeah.  Jeez.  All right, we got to get out.  That's pretty disgusting.  I know.  It's funny as hell.  Come on.  It's hilarious.  Unless they're not telling us more in the story, you know, where he purposely did it with kids around and all that.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  But it doesn't sound like it.  It sounds like just like some kind of dude just doing kind of a fraternity prank thing.  It sounds like, oh.  It sounds like he would do it at night because people said they would walk in their stores, see the imprints, and go, oh, we've been hit. 
[02:22:30]  Oh, really?  And they finally caught him, apparently, on a security camera, a surveillance camera at a middle school.  Oh.  Yikes.  So that's probably what was his undoing.  That's where he made a mistake.  Yeah.  Got to leave the middle schools around alone, I mean.  All right, we got to get out of here.  We got Dana White calling in 15 minutes.  Yeah, we're going to do the walk, and here in New York, they're going to start the rock and roll for everybody.  At least 92 minutes of nonstop rock.  No commercials.  They're going to play some sweeper, I guess, and get right into it. 
[02:23:00]  Can I mention one thing?  I'll be in Atlantic City the 16th and 17th of January.  Nice.  I think one of the shows is sold out at the Borgata.  So that Martin Luther King birthday weekend, I believe it is.  Very cool.  I'll be at the Borgata.  All right.  With that, we'll see you guys tomorrow.  Later.  Later.  We're live.  It's Opie and Anthony.  We're live. 
[02:23:30]  Plenty of share.  I want to get into the Fez crying thing, but we got Dana White calling in at any moment.  Really?  He's promoting the UFC fight for the troops.  That's tonight at 8 p.m. on Spike TV.  Go to UFC.com for details, right?  Yes.  Why fight our own troops is what I don't understand.  I don't know.  I try to talk to Dana about that.  It's not a patriotic thing to do.  Fight for the troops.  Oh, I had a typo.  I'm sorry, then.  Imagine if it was fight the troops.  That would be a hell of a fucking...  It would be short. 
[02:24:00]  It would be a short fight.  Well, are they allowed to have their weapons?  Yes.  Of course.  So the troops get guns, UFC guys, fists.  And they get fists.  They get like, yeah, different holds like that.  And the fun thing is when they start closing in on them, they get shot in the head and fall  right down.  They don't even get to touch this.  They tap out with their skull on the ground.  It would be funny, though.  Wow.  If he just sent fighters over there and the troops had to use...  And they just bullied and beat up troops for no reason. 
[02:24:30]  For no reason.  But then they're like, how is this helping anybody?  Like on the chow line, when they don't have their weapons with them or something, you just  grab someone and just start elbowing them in the face.  How horrible would that be?  Guys, what a bad hit it would be for the UFC publicity-wise.  The guy's over there, he asks for an autograph, and Josh Koscheck just kicks him in the throat  and knocks him down and yells liberal ideologies and runs away.  That's horrible. 
[02:25:00]  Hey, we got a gay guy.  No, I have a complaint.  I don't like the idea of you saying troops should be beaten.  Let's go to Jack in Maryland.  Jack.  Hey, guys.  First, I just wanted to say, Jimmy, I took my boyfriend and two of her lesbian friends  to your late show on Friday, and they all loved it.  Thank you very much.  Nice.  Very cool.  And then there was some ass sex afterwards, I'm sure.  That's great.  These gay guys are so lucky.  Hey, Jack, I know we confused the issue here on the show, but we definitely support the  gay.  Yeah, I know.  You keep being gay. 
[02:25:30]  I've been listening to you guys since 2001, and I've never once been offended by anything  you said.  Don't go turning straight.  We need our gays to listen to the show.  I know.  I know how you gay guys sometimes double dip.  But I just wanted to thank you guys for saying something to that bitch, Marcy, because it  really pissed me off that she was speaking up for us when I'm not offended by you guys  at all.  Hey, we'll speak up for you homos whenever you need it.  We're here for you.  Absolutely.  We're a fan of the queer.  We're a fan of the queer.  Yeah. 
[02:26:00]  You could explain your deviance to the Lord someday.  That's right.  You're on your own when it comes to that, but we'll help you out as you're on earth here.  What's your last name?  Offman?  What's his first name?  Jack.  See?  See?  Jack Offman.  That's simple but effective for a queer joke.  I was trying to...  I wanted to tell Marcy that she's got to understand that gays have a sense of humor, too.  They got to.  I think they would appreciate what we were kind of doing with that whole, you know, calling 
[02:26:30]  gay thing.  It's right and wrong they have no sense of...  How do you not have a sense of humor when there's balls on the bridge of your nose?  Absolutely.  Make little googly eyes with them.  There's so much you can do with that, right?  Oh, you gays get to have so much fun.  All right, listen, we got to be men now because we got Dana White on the phone there.  I know.  I don't like taking calls about man-on-man sex and then going to Dana.  It feels silly.  Hey, Jack, thanks.  All right, thanks, guys.  Later.  All right, Jack.  Thank you, man.  All right.  Come on, GM.  Go past five. 
[02:27:00]  Let's go.  Let's go.  Let's go.  You know, we missed the obvious, and Dana could wait for another 30 seconds because  we've got to linger longer here.  Mike in Jersey, go ahead.  Yeah, hey, that story that you did over on the terrestrial side, was that the butt bandit  about Jill Niggalini there?  Oh, Jesus.  Sorry to hear that.  At this point, it's like, leave the girl alone.  It's kind of funny.  It's kind of funny.  All right.  Are we banning Jill jokes?  It's not like a banning thing.  It's just like, it's such an old hat. 
[02:27:30]  Now, leave the girl alone.  I mean, it's a good line, though.  Come on.  All right.  I'm sorry.  It's just one of those, man.  All right.  We're in the moving on stage.  Yeah.  It's, you know.  That's fair enough.  Fair enough, sir.  Fair enough.  Dana White.  What's up, buddy?  Good morning, guys.  Dana.  Are you a fan of the gay?  I'm not offended by gay guys, no.  No.  Are you the, but are you a fan of the gay?  Am I a fan of it?  What exactly does that mean?  You support what they're up to, I guess. 
[02:28:00]  Yeah.  You know, we just had this conversation the other day.  Me and a bunch of my guys.  Yeah.  I don't, I could care less what people do in their own bedrooms.  There you go.  That must have been awkward, though, with a bunch of UFC guys.  No kidding.  They're all really masculine guys, and they're probably talking, like, sitting around, going,  yeah, man, fuck them.  I don't want them at our show.  And then one guy was just kind of piped up, well, they should have the right to get married.  One guy's sensitive, like a Liddell or somebody.  We're talking about how those guys, how they, you know, they had the right to get married, 
[02:28:30]  then they took it back, and, you know, I think people waste too much time on worrying about shit  they shouldn't be worrying about.  I agree.  What people do in their own bedrooms is nobody's fucking business.  Exactly.  Holla.  What the hell, you know?  I don't care.  You know, I'm not, I don't go that way, but I don't give a shit.  Whatever you do.  Hey, I could care less.  Fuck each other in the ass.  Pat from Munaki has a great line.  I'm behind the gays 100%, because I ain't standing in front of them.  Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah. 
[02:29:00]  Hey, can I, I'm sorry, Jimmy, I didn't want, I want to continue with this for one more second.  Well, wasn't the guy that beat up Kimbo Slice gay?  Yeah.  I think he was metrosexual.  I don't think he was gay.  You don't, oh, okay, I heard.  He's very metro.  Not that, I mean, I was just wondering, because, I mean, the whole pink thing, and supposedly I heard he was.  Maybe.  Maybe he is.  After that fight, you actually wanted Elite XC to be investigated for fixing fights?  Mm-hmm. 
[02:29:30]  Wow.  What do you think was going on with Kimbo Slice?  Because you, I'll say this, you're one of the only real, like, you know, I guess CEOs who speaks his mind,  and you really blasted Kimbo early on.  Yeah, well, the thing was that that drove me crazy was that, first of all, that CBS deal, we were talking to CBS for a long time.  Those guys said, you know what, let's go out, we don't need these guys, we'll do it ourselves.  They go out and they get, you know, Kimbo Slice, the guy who was fighting in people's backyards,  and I knew he wasn't real.  Everybody was all hyped up on this guy, you know, because he was, you know, because of his YouTube videos. 
[02:30:00]  He's not a real fighter.  And for the last 10 years, you know, I'm in a hotel room right now in North Carolina.  I mean, this is why I've been traveling all over the world trying to build this sport,  and we got this guy out there now on CBS, the guy who can't fight, and it drove me crazy.  So I just kept saying, you know, everybody thought he was so tough, and I said, he's not going to,  this guy isn't tough at all.  They're building their company around a guy who actually can't fight.  Kimbo's always going to be the toughest guy at the barbecue, but he's never, he's not a real athlete, 
[02:30:30]  and any of the guys in the UFC would annihilate him.  Yeah, it's amazing, like, they had a chance to do business with you guys,  and you have such a legitimate thing.  You guys know what you're doing.  Yeah, and legitimate fighters, and it is worldwide, and yet greed, and I hate,  I'm not saying, like, you know, corporations, men, but a couple of dumb lawyers probably said,  we can make money on this, but why should we cut in the UFC?  That is exactly what happened.  You're not kidding.  That is exactly what happened.  And who was he supposed to fight? 
[02:31:00]  He was supposed to fight, who was Kimbo supposed to fight?  It was changed last minute.  It was Frank.  Oh, yeah.  Shamrock.  Oh, Shamrock.  Ken Shamrock.  The day of the fight somehow.  Right.  And they ended up putting in Seth Petruzelli, a kid who actually fought on the Ultimate Fighter  and didn't win the show.  And what we ended up finding out is that the reason I went crazy is they paid Seth Petruzelli  not to go to the ground with him.  They say, listen, don't go to the ground with this guy, or don't use your Muay Thai, or whatever. 
[02:31:30]  He ends up knocking him out anyway.  How did you find that out, that you know that it wasn't just somebody, uh, just kind of...  Because Petruzelli said it on a radio show.  Wow.  No kidding.  Yeah.  Wow.  Isn't that kind of...  Now, is he putting his own fighting career in danger by admitting he took money to do  something in a fight?  No, he said...  Well, basically what they said was, they didn't say, throw the fight per se.  They said, don't go to the ground with him.  Just stand up with him.  And what was their...  Here's the thing.  You're the fan, okay?  You're a mixed martial arts fan. 
[02:32:00]  You're tuning in to watch a fight, and you think, because they're calling it mixed martial  arts, because it's what's popular right now.  But at the end of the day, you didn't know.  Or what if you bet on it?  Right.  What if you bet on Seth Petruzelli, because you think, wow, if this goes to the ground,  this kid could submit him.  Right?  But little do you know, scumbag promoters went behind the scenes and told the kid,  don't go to the ground, okay?  And now you're watching kickboxing.  That's not mixed martial arts.  And what I said is, listen, assholes, you want to go promote something, go promote kickboxing, 
[02:32:30]  because that's what that is.  That's not mixed martial arts.  You know how much strategy advice I give my fighters?  Zero.  I put on a fight, they have trainers, they train and come up with a game plan, and they  go in and fight however they want to fight.  I don't ever tell them anything to do with the strategy in the fight.  And what if Kimbo knocks him down?  What is the guy supposed to do?  Like, get up or jump up and bring Kimbo to the ground?  How is he supposed to handle that?  Right.  Yeah, it's just, it's bad. 
[02:33:00]  That's the kind of shit that I don't want in mixed martial arts.  It's the stuff that, you know, when we used to watch boxing matches back in the day,  we used to wonder, you know?  I don't ever want people to wonder about that in this sport.  Right.  This sport's still so pure.  And so, you know, I just, believe me, that's why I used to go, so everybody thinks I'm  like anti-competition or something, and I have no problem with competition.  There's tons of mixed martial arts events that happen every weekend.  You don't ever hear me talking about them.  Yeah. 
[02:33:30]  You know?  Isn't the Elite XC now done, though?  Yeah.  They went out of business.  Yeah.  They're done, so.  Let me ask you, though.  You guys are a very pure sport as far as the talent.  The system, because people have asked, like, all right, you have Brock Lesnar, who's now,  you know, he's champion, and it was his fourth fight.  Is there something flawed in the system, or is there going to be like some kind of a boxing  ranking thing where you have to fight for XM?  How is that going to work?  Because it seemed like it was just, we want to get a marquee star, although he certainly  was the better fighter or deserves to win. 
[02:34:00]  And that's the reality.  The reality is, is that, you know, my job is to go out and find the most talented guys  I can find to come into the UFC and to put on good fights.  That's what my job is.  I saw Brock Lesnar.  He came to me.  We talked, and I said, Todd, I think it's a little soon for you to come into the UFC.  I think you're talented.  This, that, but you should probably get a couple more fights before you come in.  And his thing was, I'm either good at this or I'm not.  I want to fight nothing but the best.  But you have to understand that this guy was a top wrestler in college, all American 
[02:34:30]  wrestler, number one ranked heavyweight, et cetera, et cetera.  He comes into the, then he went into the WWE, made a bunch of money, goes and actually plays  football for the Minnesota Vikings.  Had it not been for his age, he probably would have made the team.  And that's what an incredible athlete this guy is.  How old is he?  What's that?  How old is he?  He's, uh, he's 29 or 30.  Okay. 
[02:35:00]  Which is a little old for football.  Yeah, exactly.  So he comes into the UFC.  Everybody's against him.  You know, oh, this WWE guy's trying to come in.  We put him in against former world champion Frank Mir.  He almost beats Frank Mir.  You know, a lot of people say if that ref didn't stand it up when he stood it up when  he probably shouldn't have, he'd have won the fight.  Right.  All right.  So we're like, all right, this guy's definitely got some potential.  Then we put him in against Heath Herring.  Honestly, I honestly didn't think he was going to beat Heath Herring. 
[02:35:30]  Not only did he beat Heath Herring, he beat the shit out of Heath Herring.  He put a beating on him like I couldn't believe.  That was when I said, this guy's for real and this guy's ready.  You know, and a lot of people are hating on him because, you know, he got a title shot  so fast, but obviously he was ready.  Anybody who saw that fight.  He beat Couture.  I honestly didn't think he'd beat Couture, even though there was the age difference.  But Randy's like one of those guys, like, I mean, didn't he beat Gonzaga after he had  like a, was his arm was broken?  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's a dude who's, he's just fought too many good fighters. 
[02:36:00]  Exactly.  That's what you have to understand.  You're exactly right.  What people don't understand, they're just, they're blinded by this thing for Lesnar because  he came from the WWE or they don't like his attitude.  You have to understand the guys that Randy Couture has beat and everybody's saying, well,  it was just because of the size difference.  Well, Randy Couture's fighting in heavyweight.  He fought Tim Sylvia, who was the same exact weight as Lesnar and seven inches taller than  Lesnar.  Let me ask you something, Dane, about the Randy Couture fight. 
[02:36:30]  What do you say to the people that feel like Couture might have thrown the fight to get  out of his contract?  Oh, Couture.  No, I know it's probably, I know what you're going to say.  Couture's still under contract.  Anybody that says that doesn't know what they're talking about.  Yeah, that's one of those rumors that has made their way around the internet a little  bit.  So I just wanted to get your take on it.  Yeah, he didn't, number one, he would, first of all, Randy Couture would never do that.  Yeah, we've met him and he seems like he has too much pride to do something like that.  And he's still under contract. 
[02:37:00]  Right.  I still have him for three fights.  There you go.  And he's a competitor, man.  A guy on that level of competition, you know, when you're at that age where you're probably  going to fight a few more fights.  I don't think you want to throw a, you know, there's much more glory to beat a guy like  Lesnar than to throw a fight.  Absolutely.  And you're at that age now too, you're talking about your legacy.  And you're talking about making more money with wins.  And, I'm sorry, Gab.  No, that's it.  I say losing that fight, because everyone was talking about him fighting Fedor.  To me, losing that fight makes Randy a less interesting candidate against a guy like Fedor, 
[02:37:30]  who looks unbeatable.  I'm sure he's not unbeatable.  But, I mean, now you think, I mean, like, you guys have, like, what, Naguera's fighting  Frank Mir.  Yep.  That's on the 27th, UFC 92 on pay-per-view.  And the winner of that, is that who's going to fight Lesnar?  Exactly.  So we're looking at a rematch, possibly, here.  Yep.  That would be awesome.  Brock Lesnar and Frank Mir, again?  Yep.  Lesnar, Mir, or Lesnar and Noguera, both good fights, so. 
[02:38:00]  Yeah, I understand that.  But, obviously, the fans want to see Lesnar take another shot at Frank Mir.  After a little more experience.  Sure.  And that's December 27th, UFC 92.  You got some really good fights.  It's been headlined by Forrest Griffin, who beat Rampage at the fight I went to, which  really was, it was kind of hard to watch Rampage lose, because I like him.  He's taking on Rashad Evans, who beat Liddell.  Liddell, sure.  Another one, I'm glad I wasn't at that one.  Now, the Rampage, and Rampage is fighting for the first time since,  all his problems, huh?  Yep. 
[02:38:30]  Yeah.  Rampage actually took off and went to England.  He's been in the UK.  Yeah.  He's been out in the country in the middle of nowhere training with Michael Bisbing in  his camp.  Checked Congos with him.  He put together a pretty good camp out there, and he's been there for a long time.  So, he's very serious and focused for this fight.  You know, him and Vanderlei Silva, a company from Japan called Pride that we ended up  buying, they fought twice out there, and Vanderlei beat him twice.  So, this is a serious grudge match.  These guys are both talking a lot of shit. 
[02:39:00]  It's going to be a good fight.  It's going to be interesting just to see Rampage back in the game.  Absolutely.  Did he explain, like, what exactly happened that day?  That was such a crazy day, and then it kind of went away.  Is he all right, and what was going on with him?  Yeah, he's okay.  What happened was, after he lost the fight to Forrest Griffin, stayed in Vegas.  You know, he's got a whole religious side to him, too.  And he went on this fast, okay?  And he's hanging out by the pool.  He's not eating. 
[02:39:30]  He's not drinking.  He's only drinking energy drinks, okay?  Oh, that's right.  Okay.  I don't know where he came up with this one, but Lorenzo and I had dinner with him.  This Sunday, before he went back to California, and we thought he was weird, you know?  I thought maybe he was drinking or something.  He had a couple drinks.  He said he came from the pool, and he just wasn't acting like himself.  Two days later, I hear this thing happens, and I'm like, I don't know what. 
[02:40:00]  It's just not Rampage.  It's not his personality.  I'm like, maybe he must have done drugs.  He must have done drugs, or he must be drunk.  There has to be something.  I jump on a plane.  20 minutes after it happens, I'm on a plane on my way to California.  I get there, and long story short, it ends up he had something called delirium.  Wow.  When you get exhaustion, dehydration, it causes something called delirium, and that's what happened to him.  And he got treated for it, and it's weird. 
[02:40:30]  The treatment for it is, they make you sleep.  He had been up for days, had no food, was exhausted, was dehydrated, no water.  And they made him sleep, and they put IVs in him to get fluid back into his body.  And then he was 100% normal again.  He was Rampage again.  Right on.  We love that guy.  We can't wait to have him back on the show.  Yeah, he's a funny dude, man.  He really is.  He's the best.  He has an amazing personality.  It leads us to what's going on tonight there, Dana.  We got the UFC fight for the troops on Spike TV, 8 o'clock tonight. 
[02:41:00]  What can you tell us about that?  Basically what it is, this family from New York, the Fisher family, they've been doing stuff for the troops for years.  And they built this facility down in Texas.  And basically the kids that are coming back with no arms, no legs, and burnt really bad.  Like burnt, burnt, no nose, no eyelids, no lips, no ears.  And they asked me to come down one time and visit the troops down there at the center that they had built. 
[02:41:30]  So I went down there, and I was literally blown away.  You know, I've never done anything that, I don't know, let's just say that I felt so good about going down and meeting these kids.  Think about this, right?  What people don't realize is the collateral damage that happens when these kids go over to Iraq and they come back like that, okay?  Let's say your 19-year-old son goes over to Iraq to fight and comes back with no arms and no legs, okay? 
[02:42:00]  And he's laying in a hospital bed in Texas.  What do you do?  You get him strong sleeping pills.  You quit your job, and you go down there, and you sit in a chair in a hospital room beside your kid for months and months and sometimes years.  That's horrible.  You don't pay your bills.  You lose your house.  You lose everything.  A lot of these parents were sleeping in their cars.  Jesus.  It's crazy.  You don't think about that stuff when you walk around every day, you know?  And then when you go down and see it, you're blown away. 
[02:42:30]  But the Fisher family, what they did is they raised all this money.  They built this incredible rehab place down there for the kids, you know, for prosthetics and skin graphing and all the things,  trying to get these kids, you know, as well as they can.  And what they also did is they built these big, amazing houses where all the families can live in there together and stay there and visit their kids.  And they have this built-in support system because they have other families.  It's just the craziest thing I've ever done.  Wait, Dana. 
[02:43:00]  Is our government not doing that?  Dude, these guys, when these guys come back from, let's say your wife, you're married, you have one kid, or you have 15 kids.  The way that it used to be was when you came, if your husband didn't come home, he died in battle, you got five grand.  Whether you had one kid or 15 kids.  It's amazing, this scumbag government of ours, which is, and I don't mean Democrat or Republican either,  just the system in place is bailing out these fucking thieving Wall Street jizz bags, 
[02:43:30]  and they're like making families sleep in cars when their kid gets his arms blown off in fighting for the country.  It's just fucking revolting.  You know what you just said is exactly what happens.  We walk around every day, we don't realize, we're like, wait a minute, we're not taking care of the troops.  We don't take care of our own, all this tax money that we pay doesn't take care of our kids that are coming home from Iraq.  It's embarrassing.  It's fucking embarrassing. 
[02:44:00]  It's the least they could do.  I'm telling you, and when you go to one of these facilities, man, you wouldn't believe.  I brought Mandy Moore with me one time, and every time we walked out of a room, she'd start crying.  Well, of course, she's a girl.  She was just blown away.  She was hurt that much by you, your manhood?  That's great when you walk out of a room and a girl's crying.  That's a good one.  Who hasn't done that?  Yeah.  All the guys, if they had arms, they'd be giving you the thumbs up.  Aw.  If they nodded an affirmation, please. 
[02:44:30]  Yeah, right?  Tonight, well, you got the fight tonight, and it's in Fayetteville, North Carolina, and it's being headlined by Josh Koscheck.  And I can't say the first name, Yoshida.  Right.  Did I get it right?  Yeah, and Swick is on that card tonight, too.  There's a lot of good fights.  You know, Matt Wyman's on the card, a lot of good, tough kids on the card tonight.  They're all fired up and excited to be here.  Everybody's excited for the cause.  We're actually on the base right now in Fort Bragg.  That's where we're staying. 
[02:45:00]  Nice.  And so what we did, the UFC, we put together this fight for the troops.  You know, normally we'd come, we got a 10,000-seat arena here.  We didn't sell one ticket.  We're giving all the tickets to the troops and their families.  Because every dime, me, Lorenzo, and Frank, my two partners, are personally donating money to the charity.  And, you know, we're asking people to call in and donate tonight.  That's great.  They're building a new place up in Maryland now.  This one is for traumatic brain injury, for the kids that are coming home with traumatic brain injury. 
[02:45:30]  Iraq?  Yeah, we got Iraq.  We have a couple of people here that need to be sent there to tell you the truth.  There's going to be a phone number on the screen tonight?  Exactly.  And my info is wrong in front of me.  It's actually 9 p.m. on Spike TV.  Right.  It's 9 o'clock tonight.  9 o'clock.  UFC fight for the troops.  And I got to ask you, where was our invite there, Dana?  What happened?  For the fight for the troops?  Yeah, what happened?  Hey, listen.  You guys are always invited.  You know that.  You guys know you're always invited. 
[02:46:00]  I want the official...  You just got to pay for a ticket.  I want the official invite to come in the mail, a nice little invitation, you know, card.  Well, I'd have to be home to send him.  I haven't been home in months.  Here's your invitation.  This guy's quick on his feet.  I like that.  No, he actually took care of Jimmy.  Yes.  He was going to take care of us, but we were busy that weekend.  Of course we were.  I wanted to go to the Atlanta one, man.  So bad.  I had a bell at the last minute.  We'd definitely go to one.  I mean, the 27th is a tough week because we're away, but I want to go to a championship fight. 
[02:46:30]  Hell yeah.  I want to do BJ Penn, George St. Pierre.  That's Super Bowl Saturday, the day before the Super Bowl.  It's a crazy, crazy time in Vegas, so it'll be fun.  You guys are invited if you want to know.  January 30th?  January 31st.  January 31st.  Wait, Dana, why aren't you working on a big UFC fight that we could all watch during  the halftime crap?  Yeah, because they'd have to deal with a network to do that, and it's not easy to deal with  a network.  No, but what they do is they all of a sudden bounce over to another station to do it. 
[02:47:00]  Yes, that sometimes works.  Yeah, but you know what?  Every year we've done the Super Bowl Saturday, it's just a big event for us.  Yeah.  Very cool.  Let me, before we let you go, too, it's called the Intrepid Fallen Heroes Fund, and there  will be a number on the screen tonight to call and donate, because the fact that the government  isn't taking care of it, I mean, that's, it's just sickening.  Can we assume that everything's handled?  You know, you assume with the amount of money we're fucking hemorrhaging, and with the amount 
[02:47:30]  of bailouts they're giving, that they're taking care of things, but apparently not.  Apparently they're too busy holding hands with these fucking savages over in Saudi Arabia  and a garden, so donate to this cause, it's a great cause.  Well, does Dana have a number or a website?  Yeah, because there's listeners checking in now, they're like, I want to donate.  Yeah.  It's fightforthetroops.com.  Okay.  And I don't know the number off the top of my head, it'll be on the screen tonight, but  let's say, you know, if a couple million people watch the show tonight, I mean, if you can  donate a dollar, if you can donate five bucks, believe me, I know times are tough right 
[02:48:00]  now for people, and, you know, but anything people can do would be fantastic.  Very cool.  And of course, I have to finish up with asking, any movement on a Fedor fight with anybody  in the UFC?  Hey, I, you know, I'm waiting for these other knuckleheads to go out of business, and then,  you know, Fedor's eventually going to have to come to us.  I mean, this guy, everybody wants to talk about that this guy's the best in the world,  then why doesn't he want to come fight the best in the world?  It's not like I'm not offering him any money or anything like that. 
[02:48:30]  So, when he's ready to come in and prove that he's the best, I'm ready to give him  a fight.  I like that.  Yeah.  I like that a lot.  All right, well, Dana, good luck tonight, man, and it's a great cause and a headline by  Kostchek against Yoshida and Intrepid Fallen Heroes Fund on Fightforthetroops.com.  It's 9 o'clock on Spike TV tonight.  Thanks for the support, guys.  You guys are always the best.  I appreciate it.  All right, man, we'll see you soon.  Take care.  Thanks, Dana.  Later, guys.  Bye.  When he was saying in there, you know, what do you do?  I was just thinking, I said sleeping pills, but it was a thought in my head. 
[02:49:00]  You know when you're having like a crappy run in your life and you get away from it  by having a really good night's sleep?  I would just be popping sleeping pills.  Oh, yeah.  And just enjoy my sleeping life.  Semi-consciousness for the rest of my life.  It would be like living a Pink Floyd album, but that's okay.  It is strange.  This war has been like even worse than like Vietnam was supposedly a lot of covering up 
[02:49:30]  as far as bringing the bodies home.  They didn't really want to show that, but the news really had access to Vietnam.  The news has been cut off from this war, really cut off, especially when it comes to  the war dead and the war injured.  You don't see a lot of interviews.  You see some shows on History and on the Military Channel.  It pops up here and there.  But, I mean, you know, CBS and Fox and CNN, where are these stories, stories of, you know, 
[02:50:00]  the war injured and the dead, the funerals?  I mean, they just have completely wiped it under the carpet.  I heard Ronnie talking about it yesterday, and it is amazing that, you know, the Canadians,  as a matter of fact, are in Afghanistan.  They stayed out of Iraq, but they're in Afghanistan.  And when their war dead come home, now they don't have as many troops over there as we 
[02:50:30]  do, but when their war dead comes home, there's pretty much a tribute for every single one  of them.  They ride him down to the cemetery in this, down the Highway of Heroes, it's called, and  you know, they really make a point of paying tribute to these guys.  And here it's like, oh my God, there's a news camera.  Don't let them see the coffins.  Don't let them see this.  Don't let them see that.  And it's not in this morbid way where you want to see it.  I don't want to see one of those things coming home. 
[02:51:00]  But it's the fact of the matter that war is horrible.  It's a terrible thing.  And people, I think the way you prevent it is by remembering how awful and horrible it  is, and that people die and get maimed.  And to cover it up like that is just a scam to try to play down how awful it really is.  I got to tell you, I think the media, if they really wanted to, could show some more of this, 
[02:51:30]  even though Bush has made it very hard for the media to get access.  But it doesn't make a good story.  They'd rather talk about Oprah getting fat.  During that whole...  Yeah, that's embarrassing.  Oprah getting fat, you know, gets more coverage than these guys and what they're doing.  I got to tell you, Dana White is spilling his guts out about what's really happening, right, with these guys.  I'm sorry, I was trading stock.  Well, but really fast.  And then we'll get into the stock thing.  He's spilling his guts like, this is really what's happening with our boys when they come back from Iraq and Afghanistan.  And I'm looking over your shoulder as Dana's talking. 
[02:52:00]  CNN and MSNBC at the same time are doing stories on how Oprah, the billionaire, is fat and we should feel sorry for her.  Like, what the fuck?  It doesn't fucking make sense.  Who cares?  Like, that's embarrassing.  I hope she chokes on her next donut.  Who gives a shit about a billionaire not able to keep her weight down?  It really is embarrassing.  And I think, you know, no matter what side of the friggin' aisle you're kind of with, it's part of what's going on. 
[02:52:30]  Hell yeah.  There's a war.  There is a war going on.  There are people dying in it, and it's being swept under the carpet, you know?  They're just numbers.  Every month, you hear a new number.  And there's no face or name or family put to it.  And it's, if I may say, a goddamn disgrace.  It really is.  The Canadians are checking in.  Thanks for mentioning the Highway of Heroes.  Ah, fuck you, Canada. 
[02:53:00]  Shut up.  Yeah, we still hate your guts.  I'm talking about you and your stupid highway.  Just the fact that's not paid for, though, man.  The fact that you have to get donations.  For a guy that lost his arms and legs and eyelids and his nose.  Oh, my God.  I was like, how long is he going to go on?  Fucking scumbags, man.  Lost everything.  Yeah.  Scumbags we are as a country.  To fucking bail out these pieces of shit.  They really are.  You know why?  Because, again, again, it brings attention to it.  And the last thing they ever want to do is bring attention to the horror that is a real war. 
[02:53:30]  And the reasoning is then, you know, young guys aren't going to be signing up.  Because what they get to see is it's like a video game.  You know, it's like.  They show the video game thing.  Like, look how cool this could be.  If Shatner was here today, I would bring up an episode of Star Trek.  Whereas two planets were fighting each other, Opie.  It's an intergalactic kind of a war.  And what they had done is they had advanced so far that they no longer fired missiles at each other.  And literally killed each other because they wanted to save each other's culture. 
[02:54:00]  And keep that.  Because war destroys a culture.  Thank you.  And so what they did was they had these giant computers.  And they would simulate the war.  And then they'd say, hey, we just hit this city.  10,000 of you have to go to the disintegration chambers.  And they would all line up and walk in.  Because that's the treaty with the other planet.  If they didn't do that, then the real war would start.  And then the people are going, but we don't want the.  And you know what Kirk did? 
[02:54:30]  What?  He blew the fucking computers up.  He goes, now you're stuck with it.  He goes, do you know what you've done?  You've made it now that real missiles are going to come over and destroy our country.  He goes, that is warfare.  That is the horrors of war.  And that is what.  And you know what they did?  They picked up the little hotline.  They talked to each other.  They got a diplomat.  And they worked out their differences.  You know what William Shatner would say if he was here?  What would Bill have said?  After that rant?  He would say, I don't remember that.  It was a paycheck.  I read some lines on a fucking cue card. 
[02:55:00]  And I did my job that day.  And I went and I banged some young broads in the cafeteria.  I was laughing.  He doesn't remember any of this shit.  I was laughing about that last night so much.  Like, I'd bring up an episode.  I had no idea.  And Shatner looked at me and goes, I don't know what you're talking about.  You had more knowledge about him than he did.  I was one of those geeks at the convention.  You think?  What do you really think?  What do you think he does watch on TV?  I don't know.  Porn.  Like everyone else. 
[02:55:30]  Just hardcore porno.  Other stuff, I wonder.  Imagine Bill just spanking it.  I think he's...  Nice mealy cum coming out of that 74-year-old dick.  77?  77, yeah.  77?  He's a fan of the...  That was really lumpy then.  What else he watches?  He's a fan of the fisting videos, I do believe.  I think he's into good old fisting videos.  Prostate the size of Rigel 7.  Oh, the Star Trekkies are laughing out there.  They like HBO and stuff.  Oh, they really do.  Ah, shut up.  He knew your special.  All right.  We knew what you were getting at, Jimmy.  Oh, I didn't think anybody got us.  No, we got it. 
[02:56:00]  All right, just ignore me as you should have.  We're going to take a quick break.  There's a man on the stage.  Yes.  He's horrified.  He's mediocre.  He was a fan, Jimmy.  All right, UFC thing tonight at 9 o'clock on Spike TV.  I'm going to take a peek now.  Yes, absolutely.  He made that worth checking out.  When we get back, Fezzy was crying after Anthony called into the Ron and Fez show.  I didn't mean to make Fezzy cry.  I just wanted to make a point.  I'm a regular listener, but I had the Barry meeting yesterday.  Fezzy is me between the age of 7 and 12. 
[02:56:30]  What?  Crying constantly.  I would cry at the drop of a hat.  One day I don't listen, and then you get some good stuff going on.  When you call and him crying, we'll play a few of the clips after the break and get into it a little bit, okay?  Okay.  Okay, Roddy.  Da-da-da-da.  Opie and Anthony.  Would it bother you if I sat like this all the time on the show?  What?  Would it bother you if I always sat like this during the show?  I'm not looking down, Jimmy.  I mean, just to know that it's there. 
[02:57:00]  I'm not looking down.  You don't have to.  You can't see anything.  See what?  There's nothing to see.  I'm not looking.  But I have my feet.  Did you get a rod because of that picture up on Fox?  Forever Young?  Look at that one, Ant.  Come on.  What was that?  He's dishy.  It's an old dude with like a young buck's body and says forever young.  Pat from Minaki.  Thank you for turning us on to something.  We're going to take a peek.  Is it wrong that I'm jacking to teenage girls talking about texting their naked pictures? 
[02:57:30]  It's called sexting on the Today Show.  Oh, that's disgusting, Pat.  Why would you watch something like that?  P.S.  Braces are hot.  That's why.  Holy shit.  Really?  Really?  Well, the Today Show.  But, you know, we fuck up and we're disgusting chicks, right?  How come I've never seen any of these pictures?  They say, and then the pictures were posted on the Internet.  You got to be careful. 
[02:58:00]  But, but no, I'm not going, Doug Stanhope had a great fucking bit about child pornography  on the Internet and how the politicians say, you know, it's running rampant and it's terrible.  And then he talked about all the sick fucking shit he's looked at on the Internet and how  in two seconds he keeps people shitting on each other and this, that.  And he goes, and all the time he's never fucking seen child porn on the Internet.  And he goes, how rampant can it be running when I'm on there all the time just looking 
[02:58:30]  for any degenerate type of shit that he can and he just hasn't seen it?  That means he's been searching for it.  Well, you know.  Of course.  He just has to keep it clean for his special.  Stanhope's a fucking degenerate.  Right.  He's spelling kids K-I-D-Z.  All these things that try to fool the system.  Right.  He had just had a fucking funny ass stand up thing.  I know, he told us.  I can't wait.  I got to check it out.  Check it out.  Is it still up there on demand?  I think it is, yeah.  Showtime, right?  I think he's a showtime one. 
[02:59:00]  I'm not even sure.  I just popped it on and I just was cruising through the channels and it popped on and  he's drinking like a motherfucker.  He's smoking.  He's just cursing at the crowd.  And it'll come out with like the most, just the strangest fucking thought.  Right.  And really funny.  We got to have him back on the show.  Steven S. from Bayshore, but this is a fake Steven S. from Bayshore.  What?  Yeah, someone's trying to trick us today.  We all know that Steven S. from Bayshore called in gay today. 
[02:59:30]  Yeah.  And there's someone trying to play the part of Steven S. from Bayshore, but we're smarter  than that.  Imposter.  We are smart than that.  This fake Steven S. from Bayshore writes, good news, Ope.  I've had my fill of man-ass today, so I'm back to work.  Thanks for the support.  We know he hasn't had his fill of man-ass, first of all.  Of course not.  That's a dead giveaway.  And by the way, there's no queers at FH Riley, Steven S.  He just kind of hangs out at the bar hoping and hoping and hoping.  Hi.  Buy your drink? 
[03:00:00]  Two deep voices talking.  So you come here a lot?  Yeah, yeah.  I like this place.  It's right here in the heart of Huntington Village.  Can I get you something?  Well, drinking a Cosmopolitan, you?  Same thing.  We'll get two.  Could you stir mine with your cock, please?  We've got to get serious for a second.  Nathan in Vegas, he was listening to the Dana White interview.  Go ahead, Nathan.  Hey, hi, boy.  Hey, Jimmy.  Be heard, my friend. 
[03:00:30]  Be heard.  Hey, yeah, when we buried my buddy Schwab, his parents had to hire the local veterans  bikers group because those crazy fuckers were going to protest this funeral saying that  we killed fags or whatever.  Oh, that fucking asshole.  Westboro Baptist Church, yeah, scumbag Shirley Roper and a disgusting family.  If it wasn't my buddy's funeral, I shot her that day.  Yeah, I don't know how, you know, obviously I'm not advocating violence.  I never would on this program or anywhere else.  It's just, it astounds me with knowing human nature that somebody has not blown her fucking 
[03:01:00]  head off at this point.  She does things that is probably the most offensive, most infuriating things you can do.  To a person in a certain circumstance.  A loved one is dead and you're mocking that person, you're saying that horrible things  should happen to them in whatever afterlife they believe in, wishing that more of them 
[03:01:30]  would die.  Like, how does a person like that walk around and not have people just attack her physically?  Yeah, I don't know.  It's amazing.  It's unbelievable.  She's a fucking, I mean, the whole organization of them are just, they're even beyond cunts.  They're just scumbags.  They're lawyers.  She's a lawyer.  A lot of them are lawyers.  They know their rights.  Of course.  Rights are rights.  Somebody racking your head in with a crowbar, a la Gordon Freeman, is, you know, no lawyer 
[03:02:00]  is going to fucking save you.  What do those bikers actually do?  They actually go from funeral to funeral and just hold American flags.  There's probably 300 of them.  God bless them.  And just find the streets on either side so that they can't get back to them.  God bless them.  And in the meantime, they sell crystal meth.  I don't know that.  We all know that.  I'm a big supporter of the bikers.  Because I have no idea if they do that or any illegal activity.  Whatever.  So my buddy Schwab, we buried him and they kept them guys away and it was good.  Good.  Good for them. 
[03:02:30]  Good.  Good that there's somebody fighting back.  They hold up those fucking signs and you just want to, ugh, believe me.  You just wish there was a runaway car at that moment.  It's just, it's, it's just, I, just knowing basic human nature, it's, it's astounding.  I would never, again, I, if, I would never encourage people to do anything violent, but I will  say this, if something bad happened to her, if some fucking maniac did that, I would be  very happy.  Who wouldn't be?  Most of us would be.  Imagine the signs that would be at her funeral. 
[03:03:00]  Yeah.  You know, there'd be, payback's a bitch cunt.  Dead cunt had a child at a wedlock.  Yeah.  God bless love that.  All right, Nathan.  I'm going to punch out, but I just, can I pump my show real quick and I hate to be self-indulgent  like this after that call.  What type of show, sir?  It's actually a show that you guys encourage me to do.  So, you guys are my main inspiration.  What is it called?  The hang up the phone show?  No, sir.  Oh, what is it?  No, it's imeme.com slash show zero. 
[03:03:30]  I didn't even understand it.  You can slow down and say it.  imeme.com.  imeme.com.  How do you spell that?  How do you spell that?  Yeah, I don't know.  I-M-E-E-M dot com.  E-E-M.  Show zero.  All right.  What is it?  Your little podcast?  Yeah, yeah.  All right.  Call it a little podcast, poor guy.  Oh, you're getting started somewhere.  All right.  Is it audio?  Audio, video?  What do you do?  Just podcast right now.  We're working on video and we can't get the soundboard to work to bring the sound effect 
[03:04:00]  in.  We're retarded.  What do you want us to help you?  Fuck yourself.  Speaking of music, man, I heard some fucking cool guitar recently.  Did ya?  From who?  Fred Durst?  Yeah.  So did I.  All right, Nathan.  We've got to move on.  All right.  Punch it up.  Thanks, boys.  Fred Worst.  We'll get the Fred Durst thing on in a second, but we've been promising, excuse me, the-  And making Fez cry. 
[03:04:30]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Look at that.  Poor Fezzy.  Yeah, they're going to kill us if we don't get this on.  I'm sorry.  I'm going to have to apologize to Fezzy.  No, you shouldn't.  You should find a hundred excuses as to why you went wrong.  Yeah, there you go.  I'll be like Marcy.  Yeah.  Name Marcy.  Shut up.  It all started yesterday.  It calls into the Ronna Fez show.  Yeah.  It calls everyone dishonest for not wanting to see women naked.  Not wanting to see Hermione from, what the fuck is that?  Harry Potter.  The Harry Potter movies.  Of course, she was very young when they started those movies.  She's now 18 years old.  She was asked if, now that she's 18, would she accept a role if it included nudity? 
[03:05:00]  And she said yes.  Without even-  She would.  Without even thinking about it.  She said yes.  Which made everybody go like, wow.  That's hot.  It would be very cool to see her naked.  She's cute.  I think she's got a nice little body on her and shit like that.  She's of age.  Whatever.  You're not going to get in trouble.  Yep.  Uh, so yeah, uh, but then everyone's like trying to make up these excuses why and why 
[03:05:30]  even, even Dave was kind of, you know, beating around the bush on that one.  Uh, uh, but Fezzy was just completely disgusted, said he felt like he, he would feel like he  was seeing his niece naked, which to me was a little creepier than me even wanting to see  her naked.  Yeah.  Was saying that, like, I feel like she's my niece.  That's like, yeah.  All right.  I think people were being a little dishonest.  Perhaps not Fezzy.  I don't know.  Fezzy's, uh, the whole thing with Fezzy's, uh, choices in life. 
[03:06:00]  I don't know.  Uh, his, his, uh, sexuality, whatever is, uh, I, I really don't have a clue.  It's none of my fucking business to tell you the truth.  I don't care either way, but I'm just saying, honestly, if you're a guy, you want to see  her naked.  She's a hot girl, attractive.  Why the fuck wouldn't you?  I don't care when you first saw her.  It's very similar to Alyssa Milano, you know, getting naked.  We were all running out to go, wow, I got to see that.  Yes.  Yeah.  It's just, it's how old was a girl or how young was a girl that you ever knew that you 
[03:06:30]  then went out with and, or had sex with later in life?  That's, I was a late bloomer, so I'm out of this one.  All right.  So you remember like girls in, let's say kindergarten or something and then.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, Uncle Paul now.  And then you go out with them the next year, you take them out for some ice cream.  Oh, Uncle Paul.  You have one? 
[03:07:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  I knew a girl when she was eight years old and never, you know, obviously didn't even  give her a fucking, you know, at the time of day, she was the annoying younger sister  of my girlfriend.  Oh, how old was the girlfriend?  Uh, 15.  Wow.  Okay.  And then how many years?  Two, three years went by.  Yeah.  You know, two, two long years.  You guys were in AAF?  And then, uh, yeah, I went out with her later in, uh, later in life. 
[03:07:30]  I don't have one of those.  I wish I had a story to follow up yours.  What?  Let me see.  How old were you?  Uh, mm, mm, mm.  I love you.  And she was what?  I love doing math with Anthony.  Mm, mm.  What?  Oh, my God.  I fucking love Anthony.  Dude, come on.  Stan hopes you talk to Ann about certain sites.  No, it wasn't.  Directly right to her.  Yeah, Ann knows where to go.  Look. 
[03:08:00]  Just leave it at that.  Let's get into the audio.  No, you don't.  Except the nice hard dick.  Except the statute of limitations.  All right, Ann.  Have saved me.  Yeah, it's snug gloves.  Someone calls a vagina.  Ann calls into Ron Defez and calls everyone dishonest.  Yes.  What do you say, Ant?  Hi, guys.  What do you say, buddy?  Uh, yeah, I had to chime in on this.  Everyone's so goddamn dishonest.  It's pathetic.  You're all a bunch of lying sacks of shit.  Uh, the chick is fucking 18 and hot. 
[03:08:30]  Hot as hell.  Uh, who wouldn't want to see her naked?  I don't care what the fuck.  Every girl at some point is a kid.  Right.  And, and, and, and, uh, you know, she is, she is, she's a beautiful 18 year old young  woman, uh, that I would love to, and, and contrary to what you said there, Ronnie, I would  go to the movie just to see her naked.  I could care less what the story is.  I wouldn't do that.  I would just get the screen caps.  Yeah, that too.  You know, I would, I, I thought of that later. 
[03:09:00]  I wouldn't even go to the movie.  I would wait, get all the, um, yeah, because you can't, you know, rewind, freeze frame.  You can't jerk off in the theater.  Speak for yourself.  Have you seen Wally?  Jesus.  I think the curiosity would get the bestie and you'd have to check that out.  Of course.  Yes.  Yes.  It would probably be one of the most downloaded fucking pictures.  It would be one of those things.  Did Ronnie agree with you?  Um, I don't know. 
[03:09:30]  I get so captivated with my own voice.  I don't listen to anybody else.  Yeah, no shit.  What?  Uh, it says Fez is creepy.  It continues.  I think it's creepier what Fez is saying about, like, she seems like your niece.  Right.  That's, that to me is creepy.  She, she like, yeah, she was a kid.  Then she grew up.  She's hot.  If she wants to take her clothes off, that's fine.  To think of her as like some kind of little niece is, that to me is creepy. 
[03:10:00]  Instead of wanting to see her naked.  Yeah, that, I agree with you.  That's a great point, Ant.  Yeah.  Like, these are just dopes on TV or, or on the screen in the movie theaters.  You're not supposed to have a connection with them after, after you see the thing.  You know what it is, though?  Uh, Fezzy is, he's a very sensitive guy.  He's got this very maternal type of, uh, thing with, with, with, uh, certain people and  Paternal.  Kids.  No, maternal.  Believe me.  I, I, I knew the difference and I went with the one that was more accurate. 
[03:10:30]  It's, uh, it's just one of those things where he's very, uh, you know, caring and, and,  and stuff like that.  So, uh, he found that weird.  Um, Fez is a, Fez isn't the norm, you know, where it's like the average person where you  would talk.  I'm really talking about the average person there, but the thing with the niece thing  was a little odd.  Well, I mean, when we all saw Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker, I was affected by  that when I left the theater.  Like, God damn it.  Why the fuck is this guy dead? 
[03:11:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  That sucks.  If you started living your life again and you're kind of like, eh, then you're kind  of done with it, right?  Meh.  Yeah.  But he really, uh, he keeps it going for a little too long.  Thinking, uh, the whole niece thing.  Yeah.  Uh, Fez gets upset and we finally get to hear Fez.  Oh, no.  Gets upset after Ant's call.  I'm going to feel bad about it.  You haven't heard this yet.  I, I was pulling up in my driveway right at the end of my call.  Right.  And then, uh, I got out and I had shit to do around the house.  Keith was there.  So I didn't get to listen to the rest of the show.  So I didn't even know about this. 
[03:11:30]  This is the first time I'm hearing this.  I haven't heard this either.  So you, you create this, this mess and then you.  This maelstrom.  And then you assume someone will just clean it up for you.  Yeah.  Clean up now.  I'm going inside.  Well, this is what happened after you hung up, Ant.  Well, everybody has different opinions.  It doesn't make one person wrong or right.  Yeah.  I just feel stupid sometimes.  Oh, no.  Why would you feel stupid?  Oh, no.  You know what?  I don't want to see Hermione naked.  How's that?  Fez is the big winner today.  No.  See that?  That doesn't work either. 
[03:12:00]  Dave, what about you?  I don't want to see that little bitch naked.  I know.  I don't want to see her naked.  And even it is Anthony.  Was it when Anthony called up and said, you're a bunch of fucking liars, you do want to see  her naked?  But I don't take that personally and neither should you.  Oh, I try not to.  But it just makes me think, Fez, you should really think more.  What?  Poor Fezzy.  Yeah, I know.  I know.  You know what it is?  No, no.  Not yet. 
[03:12:30]  Not yet.  But you can hear it building up.  Oh, yeah.  When I said you're all a bunch of fucking, you're all full of fucking shit or anything, you're  all fucking liars or being dishonest.  I didn't mean the Ron and Fez show.  I was addressing the audience because it's kind of a reflection of that.  And I'm not backpedaling.  Believe me.  I would say the majority of people that listen to this channel would be in agreement with  what you said.  Yeah, yeah.  But they wouldn't say it.  Right.  That's what I meant.  I wasn't calling Fezzy a liar or Ronnie or any of those guys a liar except Earl because 
[03:13:00]  he says he works.  What up, what up, what up, what up.  But Fezzy has an opinion.  I like doing that after every joke now.  And Fezzy has an opinion.  Since my incendiary fucking bombing of fucking Dresden.  It was amazing.  But Blitzkrieg.  It really was.  But Fezzy has an opinion he should hold tight to that because now he's feeling bad.  Now he's feeling bad, right.  That he doesn't think like everybody else.  It's fine that that's how he feels. 
[03:13:30]  He has an opinion.  He found it creepy that other people would want to see her naked.  I said I found it creepy that him with the niece thing feeling like she would be more  like a niece.  So we just have a different opinion on it.  It doesn't mean he's wrong or right or I'm wrong or right.  It's our own opinion.  People would call me a fucking pervert.  They have.  They do.  Well, I am.  Not to your face.  No, not to your face.  What is that?  What movie? 
[03:14:00]  Caddyshack.  Thank you.  No, they don't say that as far as you know.  Right.  Yeah, that's one.  But the last couple seconds of that piece bothers me.  It makes me feel like I have to think more or something like that.  Yeah, no, Fezzy.  It's just got to be Fezzy.  Right.  Just be Fezzy.  Just be a little Fezzy.  He's so lovable.  I think when Fezzy decides to just be Fezzy.  Yes.  I think he's going to realize that life isn't that bad.  I think he'll be able to solve a lot of the things that are going on in his head when 
[03:14:30]  he just decides to be Fezzy.  You know what's great?  Everybody goes through a point in their life when they're depressed about something, regardless  of what it is, psychological, something physical, whatever it is that depressed you.  When you start coming out of that, and you don't wake up one day and all of a sudden  you're like, wow, I feel dandy.  But you do realize you're going, you know something?  This isn't bothering me as much.  And I do see the light at the end of the tunnel.  I feel better about this, that, or the other thing.  But when he gets to that point, it's going to be so fucking good for him. 
[03:15:00]  He's just got to realize that it will get to that point someday.  It really will.  But until then, it's just an awful thing to have to go through.  The uncertainty, the whole thing of not knowing if he's ever going to feel genuinely good.  But he will.  And when that happens, he's going to be so fucking happy about it. 
[03:15:30]  It's very freeing.  And I only wish that for Fez.  Absolutely.  I love the little son of a bitch.  Absolutely.  I wouldn't harm one goddamn hair on his psychotic fucking face.  On his chin.  If he was coming in today, I'd give him a big old hug, Ant.  A big old hug.  Guy should be on the back of a fucking train in 1800s running for president.  That's just part of the...  The beer thing they're doing.  He'll look normal again soon.  Yeah.  Here's where Fez starts to cry. 
[03:16:00]  I haven't heard this yet, but...  Oh, no.  This is so upsetting.  Yeah.  What was it?  Me feeling stupid.  Because Ant wanted to see Hermione naked, and I said, let an actress act.  I mean, everyone else's opinions really made sense to me after I heard them.  But there can be more than one fucking truth.  Yeah, I mean...  Even though I do disagree with you, you have a right to your opinion.  Yeah, it just felt like a mistake. 
[03:16:30]  After some other mistakes today.  What was the other mistakes?  Oh, I fucked up the phones.  Oh, no.  What'd you do to the phones?  I didn't have them on.  Oh, Fezzy.  And that happens in radio, dude.  That's part of the thing of radio.  Well, Anthony, I hope you're very happy with yourself.  Oh, thanks, Ronnie.  Should I give him a...  You brought up the fact that you went to bang an 18-year-old girl, and now Fezzy feels bad. 
[03:17:00]  And that's how it ended.  Holy shit.  Thanks, Ron.  Yeah, the thank you, Ronnie, was added live as we're listening to the tape.  Yeah, yeah.  Sorry, I wasn't part of the tape.  I just felt compelled to talk to a recording.  Can I ask a question, though?  Yes.  Why didn't Fez have the phones on?  Don't...  Jimmy.  I love Fez.  Jimmy.  But there is...  Hold on.  There's a reality.  There are phones.  Oh, my God.  They have to be on.  You're an asshole.  Ixnay on the Ones Fae.  I'm just curious.  I mean, there might be a logical answer. 
[03:17:30]  Oh, that rules.  Oh, his big rig.  Look at us.  Oh, that's nice.  With our APD.  Wow.  A rig...  He pulled up on the sidewalk.  Yeah, he's...  Yeah, he didn't double park.  No, but it looks like...  It looks like a runaway truck.  You got a lot of...  Runaway truck.  You know, Ron Bennington is not alone.  It's like, how many mistakes will be tolerated on a radio show?  Oh, leave the guy alone.  It's the phones.  He made a mistake.  Yeah, leave them alone.  He was so upset about it. 
[03:18:00]  I can't find it.  It's that crackly voice again.  I can't.  It's so upsetting to listen to.  It breaks your heart when you hear it.  I can't find the feedback I want to read.  He's just the happy...  When he's the happy Fez, one of these days, he's going to be the happy Fez again all the  time.  Absolutely.  No doubt.  And he's just going to enjoy the hell out of it.  And you know what?  The only regret he'll have is the time wasted, wasted, being so sad and so overly sensitive 
[03:18:30]  about everything.  And neglecting duties.  No, Jimmy!  Shut up!  Fez's got the world on his shoulders right now.  Oh!  My God.  Oh, the fuck?  He can't keep all that weight up.  Ron in San Antonio.  Ant, you're so mean and heartless making Fezzy cry like that.  Absolutely.  And of course it updates in the middle of that.  Of course it does.  Absolutely despicable.  Signed.  Joan Crawford.  No!  Why would she do that?  I'll tell you who else wasn't happy with it.  Alexander Graham Bell. 
[03:19:00]  You know who I feel for the most?  Ronnie.  Yeah?  Yeah.  He's like, come on, pal.  What happened, buddy?  You okay, buddy?  What's wrong today, buddy?  The phone?  The phone's Robbie?  It's gonna be okay, buddy.  No one talks about how Ronnie's a saint.  No, we love Fez.  We're fucking around.  Of course we love Fez.  We also love when things are done. 
[03:19:30]  It's the bestest.  No!  Things are done!  I'm not saying they're not.  There was a problem with the phones, apparently.  Yep.  All right, well.  And then there was, you know, the discussion that we had.  One day it's the phones, whatever.  Obviously, Fezzy's never listened to this radio show.  Oh my God.  I know.  Yeah, right?  We'd be in hysterics every day.  Yeah, we'd be fucking crying all the time.  The CD player!  And I love Fezzy so much. 
[03:20:00]  What I want to do today is play Eastside Dave's Christmas song.  Ah, yes.  Ronnie demands it.  Well, of course, on the Ronna Fez show, they're looking for original Christmas songs.  Everyone's sick of these same old Christmas songs.  Sure.  They're starting something new.  Get some new Christmas songs in there.  And I guess Dave threw one into the, threw his hat into the ring, as they say.  I hear he sung this with his mom or something.  Something like that.  Yeah.  I kind of like it. 
[03:20:30]  It's my second favorite new Christmas song from the Ronna Fez show.  Right behind Sleeves.  Sleeves.  And there's some confusion.  I actually like the Sleeves song a lot.  Anthony, no confusion, hates it.  Sleeves more than he's ever hated it.  Couldn't hate it more.  Right.  And Jimmy hates not as strong as Anthony's hate.  I feel like, first of all, I have a scab in my nose and it hurts a lot.  Second of all, I feel the way that Sleeves is strong, but I do like when you step in dog shit wearing someone else's shoes. 
[03:21:00]  Like, it's just not funny.  There's no laughs to be had there.  You know what's terrible?  While you were doing that, I was trying to think of a joke for there's a scab up my nose.  Because a scab is a worker that goes in when people are on strike.  And when people are on strike, they picket.  So I was trying to get a picket for the nose and a scab.  And thank God you were just, you were diving in for a bombing while I was thinking of that one. 
[03:21:30]  But your explanation didn't help your cause at all.  No, it didn't.  Because I saw you were doing that.  Anthony was trying to still think on the fly while he was talking.  No, no, I was done thinking on the fly.  I realized that I wasn't opening the Bombay doors on that one.  There's a scab in your nose.  Are the real workers going to picket?  See that?  Yeah, I was going for something like that.  Oh, you know, I might have been trying to get a laugh just by explaining it.  Of course you were doing it.  Might have been.  What you were doing with is you were acting like you didn't see the doors open and the bomb fall out. 
[03:22:00]  So if it hit, it hit.  If it didn't hit, no, I wasn't trying to be.  What was my bomb?  It was so awful.  I wiped it out like a childhood rape.  Which one?  No, this last one.  The one with the shit on the shoe, maybe.  It's someone else's shoes, Jimmy.  It's terrible.  It's always worse when it's someone else's shoes.  Actually, it's not as worse when it's in someone else's shoes.  Why would you be wearing someone else's shoes?  I'd rather listen to audio of Gregory Hines tap dancing than of my last joke.  Well, here we go.  And he's dead.  Yeah.  My second favorite, Ron and Fez Christmas song. 
[03:22:30]  As they try to get new Christmas songs out there for everybody.  Yeah.  Eastside Dave.  Pick it, Alice.  I heard it, Ralph.  Here we go.  Ready?  Yes.  Okay.  It's Ron and Fez Christmas time.  And we talk of joy and cheer.  Very Renaissance fair-ish.  Pepper and Mooch had too much wine and Earl sitting on his rear. 
[03:23:00]  Christmas glee turns to Christmas glow in the Christmas halls of satellite radio.  Except for the Grinch, who's not very handy.  And his name is Franklin Dandy Candy.  Franklin Dandy Candy.  Don is dandy.  It tastes like candy.  I like it a lot.  Who's the bitch singing with him? 
[03:23:30]  Oh, that's his mother.  That's his mum.  It's not a bitch.  That's his mother.  Who's the slits singing along with the song?  Hey.  Oh, guys.  I turn into the hole when it comes to slits.  Ron and Fez shows and their peeps.  Hey, she has a great cartoon voice.  Does she?  Yeah.  She has that typical cartoon voice.  She could play the old abroad in some classic Christmas cartoon. 
[03:24:00]  Did you hear it?  She's got a gig in that.  Yeah, yeah.  She's got the voice.  A little raspy.  I'm telling you.  Sounds like a raspy Dave.  Someone's saying the La La song is a copy of Everlast's song, Ends.  Oh, okay.  You know the song Ends?  Yeah.  Yeah.  No, you don't.  Yeah, I know.  No, you don't.  How's it going?  I hate that song.  All things have to end.  La La La.  The ends.  People fucking for the ends.  Seriously?  Yeah. 
[03:24:30]  It's pretty droning.  Our group sucks.  La La La.  Yeah, this one.  You know this one.  Song stop.  So you know that one.  I was going to go with it with you, but no.  Come on.  Come on now.  I like that song.  Hey, where's our live read?  You got a live read?  See, Fezzy, listen to our show.  You worry about the phones not being on, and we're yelling, where's the live read?  If he was supposed to have the live read and didn't have it right there?  Oh, that wouldn't be good.  Hell to pay.  Did you know that office Christmas parties are one of the leading causes of infidelity, Anthony? 
[03:25:00]  I never heard that before.  According to a recent article, 49% of people said if given the opportunity, they would have  a quickie with a co-worker at this year's office Christmas party.  Did you know that?  Did you know that?  Anthony?  Your son is attempting.  No, I didn't know that either.  All right.

Do you want to have nice sex or naughty sex? 
[03:27:30]  It all depends.  Is it the place or the feeling?  Because if you're feeling naughty or nice, it's more of an emotional thing.  Naughty sex, you really have to wash up afterwards.  Because I'm talking ass.  Oh, naughty sex is in the shitter.  It's ass sex.  In the fart box.  Nice sex is just, you know.  In the vagina.  Yeah, in the vagina.  You don't say twat or slit.  No, no, vagina.  It's just vagina.  And then nasty, naughty sex, excuse me, is in the anus. 
[03:28:00]  In the anus.  I want to fuck her in her anus.  Can I fuck you in your anus?  Is that a way to get ass sex on my girl?  Just be real literal and clinical.  Just saying anus takes you back to being in like third grade.  The anus.  I want to sniff her anus.  Do you know some girl said anus in health class once in junior high?  Really?  She had a question in health class. 
[03:28:30]  And I would sit on my fucking hands like, there's no way I'm asking a question.  It's too embarrassing.  Right.  And she asked, she put her hand up and asked, like, is the anus close enough to the vagina  where there'd be a, like, could something come through the walls?  Like, she asked some dumb question.  And, dude, till this day, this girl's name was Pam Bernfeld.  Bernfeld.  And I still, all I think when I think of her is that anus question. 
[03:29:00]  And I went to school with her for years.  You know why, right?  I wanted to fuck her anus.  Well, that's the obvious.  But she was sticking things up her anus.  Up her anus?  And she was scared that she was going to break the wall in between the anus and the vagina.  I don't know what she was doing back then.  What else would you ask that?  It is a dumb question, but you're a kid.  What the fuck?  I'm guessing.  It's a logical question.  What the fuck do you know?  I would probably think that she was putting little fingers on her anus.  But the way she said anus made me feel funny. 
[03:29:30]  How'd she say it?  She just said anus.  How'd it make you feel funny?  I think she might have said anus first.  And then the teacher corrected her and said anus.  No, that's shit vent.  But all I think about, any time I picture her in my head,  or anything, it's the anus girl.  Who hasn't had one finger in the...  You have a thumb in the box,  and your middle finger in the fucking tuchus,  and then you meet them...  Try to roll a strike?  Yeah, yeah. 
[03:30:00]  You meet them through the skin,  and you poke your fingernails together.  Oh!  She's real tight.  She's like, ooshk, ooshk.  Do a little roly-poly.  All right, we're out of here.  Yeah!  We want to go home on time for once.  Motherfucking A.  I gotta go to the bank.  I gotta go to the bank.  Oh, damn.  I gotta go to a bank, too.  We're going to do some banking.  We're going to donate a load.  We're going to...  That bank.  All right.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  Oh, and don't be fresh.
