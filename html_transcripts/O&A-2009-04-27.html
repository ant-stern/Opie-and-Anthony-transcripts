<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a recap of their successful independent online show, "Live at the Compound," streamed from Anthony Cumia's home.  They recounted a recent raucous birthday party featuring copious amounts of alcohol, including the swift depletion of a Guinness keg.  They bragged about the show's high viewership on Mogulist and issued a warning to their SiriusXM management, stating they had one last chance to avoid past mistakes and treat them with respect.  A phone call with Sal Deleonardi, discussing his upcoming vaudeville act at Mohegan Sun with his brother, followed.  The hosts then briefly commented on the swine flu outbreak, downplaying the media's alarmist tone compared to the relatively mild cases in the US.

Comedian Bob Kelly joined the studio.  Much of the show then centered on Twitter, with critical commentary on Kelly's own Twitter usage and a humorous display of a video showing Britney Spears with a visible tampon string. This segment was rife with vulgar language and sexually explicit jokes.  Kelly discussed his comedy tour with Dane Cook, noting the inclusion of Al Dabeni.  The conversation extensively covered the challenges of navigating Twitter, dealing with negative comments, and the complexities of online interactions.  Ed's decision to unfollow Pat from Munaki due to excessive tweeting was a focal point.  They discussed the "winky eye" and "Ja" as ways to clarify online tone.  The pervasive nature of social media, its implications for privacy (including infidelity and stalking), and location tracking apps were also discussed.  Bea Arthur's death sparked a lengthy, vulgar discussion about *The Golden Girls*, focusing on the actresses' appearances and the show's comedic elements. Kelly concluded his segment with a graphic anecdote about accidentally getting semen on his face during masturbation while under the influence of Percocets.  A sports trivia segment and a brief playing of Lisa Nova's "Twitter Whore" concluded this part of the show.  Further discussion of "Live at the Compound's" success and Kelly's tour with Dane Cook followed.

The show continued with a sports-heavy segment, covering the Yankees, Red Sox, Celtics, Bruins, and the NASCAR Talladega wreck. The hosts debated the new Mets apple at Citi Field, expressing strong disapproval.  Listener calls covered XM radio signal issues, Deep Tracks listening habits (a 2.5-hour session!), the high cost of Yankee Stadium tickets, and a Wii-related curling injury.  The New York Jets' acquisition of Mark Sanchez was discussed, along with numerous humorous discussions of cats, playing YouTube "asshole cat" videos and clips from the Iron Sheik roast. The Iron Sheik's upcoming appearance on the show was heavily promoted.  A clip of a man screaming obscenities at his cat was also played. The segment included further app discussions ("self-portrait," "police scanner," and various games), a Gary Coleman highlight reel from a previous show, and a listener call about police scanner apps.  Tony Danza's unexpected outburst on local news was also mentioned.

Taylor Parker, winner of "Rock of Love with Bret Michaels," was then interviewed.  A caller's frustrating experience as a film extra preceded this segment. The hosts engaged in sexually explicit and crude commentary about Parker's appearance and Penthouse photoshoot, questioning the authenticity of her relationship with Bret Michaels.  A heated exchange ensued, with Parker vehemently defending her relationship while the hosts persistently challenged her claims.  The conversation took many tangents, including discussions about the taste of semen, other reality show contestants, and detailed descriptions of Parker's Penthouse photos.  The producers even intervened with a call regarding a pool leak at the hosts' home.  The hosts' highly provocative and sexually explicit humor continued throughout, often at Parker's expense.  Further speculation about her relationship with Michaels and more explicit conversation concluded the segment.

Finally, Taya Parker, a Penthouse Pet, joined the show. She discussed her blogs and a Twitter photo comparison with Opie and Anthony. The conversation immediately became sexually suggestive, including comments about body parts and a graphic description of Taya's bowel movement.  Her relationship with Bret Michaels was again speculated upon, and she promoted her Adult Friend Finder live chat.  The hosts' disgust over the smell of Taya's earwax (resulting in vomiting) dominated the latter part of the segment, alongside more graphic descriptions of bodily functions.  A picture of a defecation incident was discussed at length. Spanking was discussed and a video of a man using a screwdriver was shown, causing one host to leave the studio in disgust.  Further explicit references to sexual acts and body fluids, continued discussion about her relationship with Bret Michaels, crude jokes, and plugs for upcoming appearances and Taya's Penthouse feature concluded the broadcast.  Bobby Kelly's intense reaction to the earwax incident, including multiple departures from and returns to the studio, was also noted.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  I had a dream, and it was obvious that I had a new friend.  The President of the United States of America.  Well, you don't have to go too far to analyze that one.  Yes, you're five.  How would you judge Jimmy as a lover?  Ten.  Out of?  A hundred?  Three hundred.  The Internet's going to become the magic mirror of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.  And if you look at Pinocchio...  Look at how he has to talk to us.  That's weird.  ...the Opie and Anthony radio show, the most popular show in the history of satellite radio. 
[00:00:30]  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Be very, very quiet.  Gotta adjust everything every morning.  I know.  Hold on a minute.  It's all the big adjustments going on.  There we go.  I think we're ready for another fine broadcast.  Ready for, uh, to start the whole week all over again. 
[00:01:00]  Woo!  Here it goes.  Woo!  Zippity-doo-dah.  What's up with, um, the facility today?  I'm walking around.  No one's around.  The traffic was light, too, on the way in.  Is it some kind of holiday?  Hmm.  One of those weird holidays you don't realize?  Like, you know, that some people have the holiday, you know, the gym, whatever.  Because isn't there, isn't there like 20 morning shows going on right now in this building? 
[00:01:30]  Yeah, supposed to be.  I don't see nobody.  Yeah.  Lazy fucks.  Yeah, we're here.  Do they just kind of roll in right before six and start their morning show?  Maybe that's how they roll.  I thought we were lazy, but, you know, I realize there's people definitely more lazy than us.  At least we flip through a paper or two.  Yeah, we try.  On a website or whatever.  How many listeners did you have over at your house over the weekend?  Because all I'm seeing on the instant feedback is, man, I had a lot of fun at Anthony's this weekend. 
[00:02:00]  And it's names I've never seen before.  Oh.  Well, I guess people were just checking in.  Oh, my God.  Me and Danny, first of all, did a show.  I guess that was Friday night.  You guess?  Uh-oh.  Hold on, Danny.  You guess?  I suppose it was Friday night and Saturday morning.  And Saturday morning.  I think we started around 10 p.m. and did not stop until 4.30 a.m.  Yeah.  And then I just heard snoring from the couch when the sun was coming up. 
[00:02:30]  I realized, Danny, just crashed out on the couch.  That happens to me sometimes.  I was just like, I know that it's time to sleep, but I just won't admit it.  And then my body just takes over.  And it physically walked me over to the couch.  Watch out.  And was just like, just lay down, dude.  I heard snoring.  So he was gone.  And then Saturday, I just went on really quick for about an hour at most.  And then Sunday, I just left the camera running in the back as my mother and Sal and Sal's brother and Sal's brother's wife and, you know, everybody else from the party just like rambled at the table. 
[00:03:00]  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Oh, that's awesome.  Sal trying to tell a joke and just screwing the whole thing up.  And then his brother coming over to tell the same joke because he was going to show Sal that he could tell the joke.  And Sal kept chiming in.  No, it goes this way.  Just those two.  The DeLeonardi brothers could put a show on. 
[00:03:30]  Just let them ramble.  Sounds like a vaudeville act.  Yeah.  And now the DeLeonardi brothers.  You've got to figure out how to get some of this stuff onto the channel, though, my friend.  Yeah.  You know what it is?  I know you've got your whole thing going on and you don't really want to, like, mix the two too much.  But you should bring some of that stuff over here.  You definitely will.  I would love to hear Sal trying to tell a joke.  I know.  I definitely will.  The whole thing isn't really kicking off, though, until the 5th of May. 
[00:04:00]  That's when all the lines are in.  Everything's right.  So now it's just been these test shows that we get on and just start, you know, going off for a few hours on end.  Sometimes it's all night.  Sometimes it's an hour.  Whatever.  I love how our radio show is becoming just a place for us to go to promote our other things.  Our other shows.  And no one's on to us yet.  I come in here like, ooh, I can't wait to promote some videos I'm putting up. 
[00:04:30]  I can't wait to promote my Twitter.  You can't wait to promote your other radio show.  Yeah, my other radio show that I have that I don't get paid for.  I don't, you know, just get on and do a show.  Well, there's business and management in general.  I'm not naming names.  I could be talking about management in general, meaning our entire radio careers.  They have gotten us to this point where we just want to, like, do our own thing without having to worry about the nonsense. 
[00:05:00]  That's it.  The nonsense.  That's exactly what it is, and that's why we like doing this stuff.  And I'll tell you right now, to the new management here at Sirius XM Satellite Radio, you've got one more chance to keep us happy.  One more chance.  Don't blow it like every single other person we worked for.  Don't ruin it.  Right.  You have one more shot at this.  That's outside at the birthday party, I guess.  Yeah, there's a mom. 
[00:05:30]  It's almost like a home movie is playing on the screen.  Oh, look at your mom.  The beer in front of her.  She's pointing at the camera like, I'm on count.  Could someone go through this and get maybe just a couple clips from the big, you know, birthday weekend that Anthony had at the compound?  Not sure how long that one actually runs, but, yeah, if there's anything on there that's actually worth it.  Just some quick hits.  Because there's people listening to us right now that haven't, you know, tuned in to live at the compound yet.  We're live from the compound. 
[00:06:00]  Is the Sal telling the joke on demand?  I'm not sure.  That's just that some of the on-demand stuff isn't, like, formatted yet.  I don't know.  It's just a pain in the ass, that site.  I've really got to be honest with you.  I should just be able to have it and have stuff on there.  And I don't think he's on that one.  Oh, there.  I'm eating.  No, it's just a lot of fun.  And, like I said, May 5th, all the wires are in the phones, which is a real important part.  That'll all be done. 
[00:06:30]  We were going through 800 numbers last night, trying to figure out what the 800 number will be to call up.  And we had a few good ones.  You're starting another show right in front of their eyes.  I know.  I love this.  In front of their eyes.  Right in front of their eyes.  See what you've done to us?  Look at what you've done.  I had to build a studio in my basement.  And it all comes down to, like, you know, we've been in this building, what, three weeks?  And just some of the dumbest, silliest, easiest radio bits that you kind of just get in your face about. 
[00:07:00]  Like the dumb bowling bit.  Oh, it's got to end by 8.15.  Yeah.  Not live at the compound.  No.  If Anthony wants to bowl all night, guess what?  He's going to bowl all night.  Bowl all night.  And he has to deal with neighbors.  Don't even care.  We had a great gun show and tell on Friday.  Everyone loves seeing the guns.  Are we going to be allowed to do a gun show and tell here?  You think you'd be able to tote rifles up into the building and start showing them off?  I think not. 
[00:07:30]  What about puppetry of the penis?  If you want guys making shit out of their penises and you want to invite some women in, guess what?  You're just going to invite women in.  That's it.  You're not going to have to deal with human resources or nothing.  No.  And then once the pool is opened up, a jacuzzi cam.  Jacuzzi cam.  Topless jacuzzi cam.  Topless jacuzzi cam won't even be a problem.  You should just have a cam, jacuzzi, big sign, topless jacuzzi.  Topless jacuzzi.  And then some hot babe is there with her nice little bikini top.  You're like, sorry. 
[00:08:00]  You see the sign.  It's topless jacuzzi cam.  Get the top off.  I mean, that's the kind of show I want.  You're developing a new show right in front of their eyes.  Right in front of their face.  Brilliant.  Well, management did this, though.  Look what they forced us to do.  What can I tell you?  All the nonsense you tell us day in and day out.  Yeah.  It gets to you after a while.  It started out really with an idea of just, you know, I want to do a podcast.  Something I can upload to maybe iTunes. 
[00:08:30]  People could download it.  And it would be just a quick little radio show talk thing.  Right.  And it ends up now being a TV camera in there, lights, green screens, all kinds of stuff going on.  Now phone lines are going in.  I'm getting a Fios fiber optic cable into the house now so I get a faster connection.  And this is all from the idea of just, maybe I'll just get a little podcast going. 
[00:09:00]  And now it's that.  And on the Mogulist site, whenever I go live, and usually even during the recorded things,  the number one show on the entire platform, even foreign language shows, it goes to number one.  I'll tell you what.  I'll have a whole problem with this.  When you have a better studio than what we have here.  And it's coming.  And you're just about there.  I'll tell you something.  The mics sound better.  I have great mics and a good compressor limiter in there that just really sounds good. 
[00:09:30]  No, we got it.  We got it.  We got it.  We got it.  We got it.  No, you're going to love the tiny little studio we give you.  You're going to love it.  You're going to love it.  You want a few stats from the Mogulist channel, Anthony Radio, live at the compound?  Oh, let's see some of the stats.  Last 24 hours, 404,272 hits.  Ah, that's nice.  This week, 1.8 million.  Wow.  For the month, which is all time, 2.1 mil.  And I'm in, what number? 
[00:10:00]  I haven't been on the air in a long time.  Where am I right now?  Well, right now, as far as English language goes, you're the fifth most popular channel.  And I'm not on the air.  You're not even there.  I mean, there's four channels that are live that are ahead of you.  You do have 71 people in the room watching nothing.  That's hysterical.  There you go.  It goes up to thousands, though.  There you go.  It's hysterical.  Warning to management, you have one more shot.  That's it.  One more shot. 
[00:10:30]  The internet is the future.  To do the right thing.  Do the right thing for once.  We're on to you.  We're so on to you.  Yes.  There was one point on Saturday, excuse me, yeah, Saturday morning, I suppose, where there  was 1,400 people.  I know.  Just hanging out.  Yeah.  It's like three in the morning.  Yeah, three in the morning.  You know what I like about Live from the Compound is I was supposed to stop by Anthony's.  Yes.  And I got a lot of shit from a lot of people.  But I had a wedding way out east. 
[00:11:00]  So I wanted to be there Saturday badly.  But I just couldn't make it from this wedding that went all night.  And then whatever, blah, blah, blah.  And then yesterday, I wasn't sure really what was going on because I was here and there.  But I felt like I was there anyway.  Because the next thing you know, I'm just watching Live from the Compound.  And I'm like, see, I'm at Anthony's birthday party.  You can pop it on virtual.  I popped up a picture.  I went, I'm spying on you, birthday boy.  Yeah, I saw that.  Spying on you.  I'm watching you.  Oh, I see you. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah.  And then we were talking about the Guinness keg.  Did you officially go through the first one?  Well, we're pretty much there.  Yeah.  Pretty much there.  There's not even a couple of pints left in the bottom of that keg.  And then Keith went through the order form and said, okay, we got this keg delivered on April 8th.  I go, okay, so what is it now?  He goes, the 26th.  And that keg is gone. 
[00:12:00]  Wow.  Now, for a bar, that would be nothing.  Well, how many?  For your house.  How many beers does a keg pour?  Do we know that stat yet?  I used to know, but Guinness kegs are actually a little, they're slightly smaller.  I got to do the math real quick.  No, I know that because we got Guinness at the joint.  But, yeah, someone give us that stat.  How many nice Guinnesses can you pour from one keg?  Give or take spillage, obviously.  More than should have been gone in less than a month. 
[00:12:30]  Are you through your Bud Light keg, too?  Yeah, that one, put a dent in it.  Put a dent in it.  We slowed down the Guinness consumption when the Bud Light keg went in.  But, oh, last night was just great.  Danny's behind the bar, mixing drinks.  I was getting tips.  Yes, getting tips.  Nice.  Mixing drinks and everything.  It was just a good time.  When are you going to have, like, a staff?  I'm waiting for that, yeah.  I need a bartender. 
[00:13:00]  Dude, I'm not even kidding.  Like, on a Friday or Saturday night, you should hire some really hot girl to, like, you know, to waitress.  Need a staff.  Or bartend.  Or do, like, a shot girl thing.  Or a combination of all of them.  Combination of everything.  That.  Produce the show.  Produce the show.  Press the buttons so I can friggin' talk without having to switch graphics and everything all by myself.  A Guinness keg is 106 and a half pints.  Ah.  Right.  106 and a half. 
[00:13:30]  That's not so bad.  I just hope management knows that we know that they're not taking care of us.  I'm telling you.  So we take care of ourselves.  Yeah, the theme today is you have one more shot.  We need respect, finally.  After how many years?  How many years?  We're heading toward 15 years doing this together.  Yeah.  And we want respect.  We're smart.  We're smart.  I want respect. 
[00:14:00]  I got an allergy voice today.  Anyone else's allergy is out of control?  Uh-oh.  Is it an allergy?  Or is it the swine flu?  Did it!  Wow.  Boy, that's the big friggin' scare tactic story, isn't it?  Well, let's keep it basic.  First of all, 103 dead in Mexico from the swine flu.  Mexico.  Thank you.  That's what I'm thinking.  I'm like, there are animals down there.  You can't even drink the water without having explosive diarrhea. 
[00:14:30]  They're trying to figure out, and I love that.  It's like, well, we have had cases here in the United States, but the cases in Mexico seem  a lot more serious because over 100 people died, and here people are recovering.  So they want to know if it's a different strain, and I'm listening and going, no, it's  Mexico.  And the people that got it here are people that got it in Mexico.  Right.  They went to Mexico on spring break, came back here, and have it. 
[00:15:00]  But the thing is, medical care is so much better here, and you're not, you know, living  in a hovel.  Well, you're absolutely right, but the dumb media, which, and people, I love that people  go, but aren't you part of the media?  You're part of the media, too!  Too!  No, we're not.  I understand.  You're part of the problem!  We're sort of, like, we, like, skew the media.  We kind of, like, we're here to kind of watch them closely. 
[00:15:30]  Technically, the tools we use are the same that the media uses.  Technically, we are.  I mean, we speak into a microphone, and it does go out to the people.  Right.  But that's where the similarity pretty much ends.  Well, I'll tell you.  If, if, uh, Diane Sawyer.  Give me some of those big media people.  What's some of them out of media people?  Uh, uh, the local, the local news people.  Uh.  Katie Curran.  Keith Olberman.  Sean Hannity.  Keep it fair, right?  And Larry King. 
[00:16:00]  Larry King.  If they start talking about their duties.  Yeah.  And the nice shit they take.  Then we're officially part of the media.  That's what separates us, my friends.  We talk about our duties.  That is quite a popular subject, too.  Right.  Uh, that will pop up, uh, out of nowhere.  Sure.  But the media, uh, this is perfect for them.  They're all over the swine flu.  Uh, it's something that we should watch very closely. 
[00:16:30]  Oh, jeez.  Yeah, we'll talk to them in a second.  Uh, we have to watch it very closely.  But 103 are dead in Mexico.  And the people that have it here in New York City, because they came back to New York after their lovely spring break, they're fine.  Mm-hmm.  But we gotta watch this damn thing.  Of course.  But the media's gonna make this sound like, you know, it's gonna be out of control any day now.  Pandemic.  They've been using the word pandemic.  Remember the bird flu?  Yeah.  What happened?  What?  No one's talking about the bird flu anymore.  What happened to the bird flu?  It's still out there, right?  It's like the birds are still getting the ha-choos. 
[00:17:00]  Yeah, ha-choos.  But it was supposed to be, like, the big thing that they were scared of, and now it's the swine flu.  You just do animal flu.  Yeah.  Blank animal here, flu.  Yeah.  And it scares the crap out of everybody.  The beaver flu.  The beaver flu coming soon.  Oh, that would be the runny beaver.  All right, Sal needs to talk, so let's get him right on the show.  There we go.  Sal!  Yeah, guys?  Hello.  What are you doing up so early?  We're ready to do the vaudeville act. 
[00:17:30]  Oh, you're taking it on the road?  Yes, we're going on the road.  We're playing Mohican Sun today.  The DeLeonardis?  I like that.  Your brother Joe just popped in.  Oh, he's going too.  And guess what?  Mama crash.  Is she not going?  No, she's in bed.  Where are they going?  Should have busy night.  Mohegan.  Oh, they're actually freaking doing vaudeville.  Yeah, they're actually going up and going to Mohegan Sun. 
[00:18:00]  For the day?  All of them.  Yeah.  What the?  That's not...  Is there a holiday today we don't know about?  Yeah, any holiday today?  Any...  Something's going on.  Okay, you guys can come up.  Just get the jet or something to bring you up there.  All right.  Yeah, we'll get the jet and...  Well, people got to...  You know, we got to work, unfortunately, Sal.  You know.  Oh, I forgot.  We got jobs.  All right.  I forgot.  I should have taken the day after my birthday off.  Damn. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah.  Probably could have gotten away with it.  Of course you would have.  Did everybody have a good time there yesterday, Sal?  It was perfect.  Yeah, the weather was great.  What was God doing for you?  He gave you the perfect weather.  Oh, of course.  It was God.  Hey, by the way, did your pool fill up?  No, my stupid dribbly hose is barely filling the goddamn pool up.  I'm supposed to have it uncovered today.  What's wrong with your hose?  Ah, dribbles.  I need more pressure.  I got to have the sprinkler guy come and turn the sprinklers on.  Your hose has the drip. 
[00:19:00]  The drip.  It's like the last squirt of a piss.  Hey, did Keith make my connection?  Oh, what?  The cocaine you're supposed to...  No, what connection?  For dinner up there.  Oh, I'm sure.  Yeah.  I won't worry about it.  You'll be all set.  You're all set.  All right.  There they go.  All right.  You kids have fun up there, all right?  Yeah, we're going to win a lot of money, and I'm moving in next door.  All right.  That sounds fun.  See you later, guys. 
[00:19:30]  All right, Sal.  Have fun.  Have a good time, man.  There they go.  Tony says hi.  We'll see you next trip.  All righty.  His brother, Tony.  Okay.  Tony.  Bye.  Bye, Sal.  Bye.  There you go, Sal.  Yeah, he really has the Baltimore accent.  Tony?  Yeah, Sal's brother, Tony.  I love the Baltimore accent.  Tony and Baltimore.  I live in Balmer.  Yeah.  That's what he says.  Yeah, my goddamn hose, man.  Ah.  The first thing, I hooked up to the spigot on the side of the house, and I put the hose  in the pool and turned it on, and then I was checking on it, so I pulled the hose 
[00:20:00]  out, and it's just going bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop.  I'm like, damn it.  I should have checked that.  Bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop.  So I checked the other side of the house, and I hook it up to that one, and it was working  better, but not as good as when the sprinkler guy turns the system on, because I have  some spigots hooked up to the sprinkler, which really pumps the goddamn water out, but these  bastards, they don't just put a valve in your frigging garage where you can just turn  the sprinkler on. 
[00:20:30]  There's a tool that's about three feet long that goes into a hole in your lawn with a  special key-like thing that they spin three or four times, and that turns the water on,  and it's just so you have to call them.  Of course.  So they can charge you for turning it on.  Put the valve where I can get to it, so I can turn the goddamn sprinkler on.  Dude, just snap your fingers, you'll have that tool by this afternoon.  Sons of bitches, I want that tool.  Someone get that tool and just throw it on Anthony's lawn so it's there when he's... 
[00:21:00]  That's it.  ...when he comes home today.  Get it down there.  I want to spin that frigging thing and start using the sprinkler spigots that really fill  the pool.  I can get three lines in that pool, it'll be filled up in a day and a half.  What's wrong with you?  It's going to be, what, 90 today or 90 tomorrow?  Dude, 90 tomorrow, and then...  You're going to blow it.  You're going to get the pool done just in time for April to hit us in the face with like  40-degree weather.  Well...  50-degree weather.  Dude, they're talking 48 degrees as a low. 
[00:21:30]  When?  Up to like in the 50s, right after it's 90.  Yeah, so...  So they'll come maybe open the pool up, and then the temperature's just going to plummet  again, just to stick me in the ass.  It never fails, man.  Let's go to Brian.  We got the...  Brian!  We got the Guinness keg math equation done, finally.  Brian in Detroit, what do you got?  It's 6.8 cases, which was about 160 beers. 
[00:22:00]  6.8 cases?  No, Danny's shaking his head no.  It's more than that?  Well, no, no, no.  He's...  How much did you say it was?  6.8 cases.  Yeah.  One of my best friends is a deliverer, a peer deliverer, and he delivers Guinness.  Yeah, but Guinness kegs are...  It's a Euro keg, and the European kegs are actually...  They're smaller than U.S. kegs.  Oh.  Yeah.  We got them.  It's 106...  Roughly 106 and a half pints.  Okay.  That's not...  That's not a lot.  There's Guinness 250. 
[00:22:30]  Well, it's a lot when you try to pick that keg up and realize how heavy it is when it's  full.  It's over...  It's 13 gallons of beer.  But I'm just saying...  But you guys had 106 beers in just under three weeks?  That's not a lot.  No.  It's not at my house.  Because you've had people over, right?  You've had a lot of people over the last three weeks.  Well, you know...  Yeah.  No one was really drinking the Guinness, though.  No.  I mean, the Bud Light tap was flowing pretty regularly.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, you got to throw in the fact that there's a Bud Light keg also.  Exactly, sir.  And hard liquor.  And, you know, and then some bottled beer, you know. 
[00:23:00]  And who knows what else, right, guys?  Yeah.  Frozen Jaeger machine, which needs an outlet.  You got a Frozen Jaeger machine?  Joe brought one over.  Not even one of the old ones.  A new one.  So he got the Frozen Jaeger.  And then the wine, too.  So the wine cellar, you know, might want a glass of wine.  Man, I might have to go old school and go over there for a weekend.  Oh, it's intense.  I thought I was crazy because I opened up a nice bottle of wine on Friday night.  No, it's these weekends last from the second we walk out of here on Friday until pretty much the second we walk in on Monday. 
[00:23:30]  Yeah.  Wonderful.  It is a lot of fun, though.  Well, this guy works for the water company.  Let's see.  Let's see what kind of advice he has.  Hi, Richie from Suffolk.  Anthony, what's up?  How you doing, man?  Listen, it's not low pressure, brother.  You got to have your wine blown out.  It's the amount of water going through your pipes.  Your pool will fill up in a heartbeat.  You got to call up your local water company, bro, and have them blow out that water service of yours. 
[00:24:00]  I don't know.  Everything else seems fine.  It's just my house spigots on the outside.  I work for Suffolk County Water, bro.  So call your local water company, and they'll come and blow your wine out, man.  Your pool will fill up in a minute.  Yeah, you blow my wine out.  And then you can go get your wine blown out, bro.  Yeah.  That's right.  Peace out.  Love you, boys.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  A little advice.  I know.  I've heard this one, too.  Hook your hose up to the... 
[00:24:30]  I want to hear if he said this or Travis just wrote it that way.  Hit Todd in Rockland.  All right.  Hello, Todd.  What's up, boys?  Hi, sir.  Yeah, man.  You got a fire hose in your house, man?  We'll hook a fucking two-inch hose up, man.  We'll have that fucking big field in no time.  There you go.  Okay, because here it says hook your hose up to your fire extinguisher, which would really suck  if you hooked your hose up to a fire extinguisher and jumped into maybe some foam or some of that powdery stuff. 
[00:25:00]  Yeah, I was thinking about that, too.  But a lot of people call shenanigans on that around your neighborhood.  I have a hydrant about three or four houses away.  And if we get a pumper up there and stuff or a truck with a hose, some neighbors might call some people.  Yeah, I'm sure they would be, man.  I'll just sit there.  You know, compare to your house and your broadcast center, this is starting to feel like college radio over here. 
[00:25:30]  Oh, it's insanity.  This is college radio.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then, you know, that, the theater is fine.  Management, you have one more shot at this.  One more shot.  We don't have a movie theater here.  We don't have a bar.  We don't have kegs flowing freely.  We don't have a pool.  We should.  Talk about anything.  Talk about anything.  Do puppetry of the penis in front of broads. 
[00:26:00]  Doesn't even matter.  We could do our hallway bowling as long as we want.  Yeah, we could shoot guns if we want.  Right, Ed?  If we want.  We get the swine flu.  Swine flu.  What's up, Steve?  Oh, my God.  All right.  Yeah, Bob Kelly's going to be in here in a few minutes for Jim Norton today.  Norton's taking a little personal day.  He rarely takes a personal day.  Bob Kelly, by the way, I'm going to have to talk to him about his Twittering. 
[00:26:30]  He's going to have to be spoken to about it.  Yeah, we'll talk to Bobby in a few minutes.  First, speaking of Twitter, we've got a couple of Twitter songs we want to kind of throw out there to the people that haven't heard him yet.  And one of them probably pertains to Bob Kelly, this one.  Uh-huh.  Okay, good.  That's part of it.  Part of it.  Yeah, we could do a whole little discussion on Twitter.  Yeah.  By the way, Twitter is a shooting star.  You think that's going to burn out?  This thing got popular way too quickly, and usually when that happens, it just explodes into nothingness. 
[00:27:00]  Oh, and here's a little tease for when we talk about Twitter.  Uh-huh.  I stopped following somebody.  Me?  No.  Oh, no, you never follow me.  I won't even say.  I stopped following somebody.  And at the same time, a few other people did, too.  Really?  At my house over the weekend, we were assessing some people and said, time to stop following this person. 
[00:27:30]  Yep.  Britney Spears?  Done.  Britney Spears?  Nope.  Did anyone see the video of Britney Spears and the tampon string?  Oh, yeah.  Okay, that I got to see.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Oh, yeah.  Must see.  I'm hoping he has it, Danny, but it might be the guy we hate that has it.  Oh, really?  And you know who the guy we hate?  Oh, wait.  Is it up?  Go up.  Is it?  No, no.  That's her hair extension falling out.  I know. 
[00:28:00]  Go to the website of the guy we hate that we have no desire to promote anymore because he's a douchebag.  I love the fact that she's just such a mess.  Oh, yeah.  She's dancing all sexy and keep...  I thought it was Norton for a second.  Go down another one.  It says this.  Oh, it is this.  Sorry.  Another visual bit for everybody.  Sorry.  Do a little search and you can see it for yourself.  Britney Spears has a little tampon string hanging out.  No fucking way. 
[00:28:30]  During one of her dance numbers.  Here it comes, Ant.  You'll know when Ant sees it because the...  Oh, wait.  Whoa!  Holy fan-fucking-tastic.  Does that take you immediately out of the game?  Does that take you immediately out of the game when you see that?  Oh, oh, damn, yo.  Come on.  Look at that string hanging out the side of her pants. 
[00:29:00]  The crabs are bungee cord jumping.  Oh, that is great.  Isn't that wonderful?  Just a big bloody cotton ball at the end of that fucker.  I like how you guys just laugh at women for things they can't control.  Ha-ha!  She's bleeding out of her vagina.  You know what?  And she has to do something so it doesn't drip all over the place.  But I don't give a shit.  I just don't want to see the string.  We understand that crap's going on. 
[00:29:30]  But we don't want to see the evidence of it.  No.  That string...  Tuck that up.  When you see that string hanging out, oh, is there anything worse?  Why wouldn't she, if she's wearing something so revealing, why wouldn't she keep that up there  and tape it to her pubis or something just to make sure it doesn't pop out?  Maybe she wanted it to.  Oh, my God.  Well, there you go.  Making a little news.  I wouldn't put it past her that she would pull that out and go, watch, I'm going to  I'm going to dance around with my tampon string hanging out. 
[00:30:00]  You're probably right.  I think that all this stuff is calculated.  Does she need 800 people on stage dancing with her because she's so fucking untalented?  Wow, that string is really...  Dude, it's like completely out.  Her tampon's ready to fall out.  It's jiggling and it's jingling and jangling.  You think you can keep your tampon string from jingling and jangling?  It's like pasty tassels.  Yeah, spinning around as she does a horrible dance with a bunch of gay men on stage with her. 
[00:30:30]  That's why no one noticed.  They weren't looking at her vag because they're looking at each other's penises.  Wow.  Now Kelly's trying to get our attention with the moon.  We'll get you in a few minutes.  Oh, wow, look at that.  I knew that wasn't Jimmy.  These comics are so effing needy.  We'll get to you in a minute.  Hang in there.  No, not your cock.  Keep that in there.  Keep that little fucking acorn inside.  No shaking hands now. 
[00:31:00]  Oh, he talked.  Look, he's got...  Josh in Philly.  What's up, Josh?  Hey, morning boys.  How you doing?  Pretty good, Josh.  And what you need to do for your pool, the easiest thing of all is I used to be a volunteer  firefighter.  You call your local firehouse, ask to bring the tanker truck over with a few loads of water.  You throw them a couple hundred bucks maybe and they'll fill your pool up for you within  two hours.  Yeah.  Is that real? 
[00:31:30]  Absolutely.  Dude, you got to get the fire department.  Put that on cam.  Do that in a second.  Who wouldn't want to see your pool filled up by a fire hose?  I've never seen that before.  A couple of seconds.  That's pretty cool.  I think it'll be done.  Nice.  All right, Josh.  I'll look into that.  Thanks.  Let's do the swine flu.  So the media, you know, they're jumping on this one.  I mean, like I said, we got to watch this, but they're already blowing it out of proportion,  just like they did the bird flu.  Yeah.  I think the bird flu was two years ago at this point.  Encephalitis.  That whole thing with the legionnaires is big. 
[00:32:00]  There's all kinds of stuff going on.  The World Health Organization has declared the swine flu outbreak in North America a public  health emergency of international concern.  Parts of Mexico City were shut down and schools were closed there to try to control the spread  of the disease.  Many are also wearing masks to avoid getting sick.  The flu has already killed more than 20 people.  The country's health secretary says that Canadian labs have helped to confirm the never-before-seen 
[00:32:30]  strain, a genetic mix that is part human, avian, and swine flu virus.  You know, everyone talks about dirty bombs and nuclear war and all that stuff.  What's going to take humans out is one of these new freaking strains of the flu or some  other disease we don't even know about yet.  And it's going to knock us out within a year.  You think?  Oh, that's how it's going to end.  Absolutely.  It's going to be just some crazy thing that they can't control.  Disease. 
[00:33:00]  Uh, more on this.  Eight confirmed cases of swine flu have been traced to St. Francis Preparatory School in  Fresh Meadows, Queens, where a number of students recently returned from a spring break trip  to Mexico, where a swine flu outbreak has been deadly.  Today, the school was thoroughly scrubbed and cleaned.  The private high school, with some 2,700 students, will be closed on Monday and Tuesday as health  officials continue to monitor the situation.  Mm-hmm. 
[00:33:30]  Mm-hmm.  And then finally...  The parents are concerned, rightfully so.  Announcing the state has activated its health emergency preparedness plan, state and city  officials tonight tried to reassure the public.  If you're sick, stay home.  Um, try to limit your contact with others.  If you cough, cover your mouth, cover your nose, um, so that you can prevent the spread,  wash your hands, and if you're not sick, go about your business.  Wow.  Thanks for the advice.  Go about your business.  Thanks.  Thanks for that wonderful advice on a strain of the flu that could take out humans. 
[00:34:00]  Cover your mouth.  That's the best you could say.  Mind your goddamn business.  Cover your mouth when you cough.  Wow.  Thanks for that.  That'll, uh, that'll make sure it's not spread to every single human being walking this earth.  And that ain't helping you cover your mouth.  That means you already got it, so screw everyone else.  Yeah, and if you have that, don't you want to take other people out with you?  Yeah.  Don't we all like that kind of?  Yeah, let's just, you know, let's do the whole village. 
[00:34:30]  Right.  All right, Bobby really wants in here.  Bobby.  Bobby.  We did show, uh, we did tell him to show up at 630, so it's only fair we get him in.  But why don't we take a break?  All right, we can do that.  We're going to break, uh, we're going to talk to Bob Kelly next.  Jim Norton's taking a personal day.  For a good reason.  Yeah.  For a good reason, I'm hearing.  Yeah?  Mm-hmm.  Uh, he'll tell you all about it tomorrow, I'm sure.  Go for him.  We go to break with, uh, I don't know, I like this song.  Uh-oh.  I was turned on to, uh, Twittered at by, uh, Annie Malinakis. 
[00:35:00]  Twittered at?  I think that's how you say his name.  A comedian that we've, uh, said no to many, many times, so I felt really weird when I  was communicating with him this weekend, because I'm like, oh my God, we've blown this  guy off a lot, and maybe we shouldn't have.  He's got a song that's kind of going viral on the internet.  It's called Twittered at.  He would appreciate it if you go to iTunes and maybe, you know, spend, uh, 99 cents on  his, uh.  And download it.  On his creativity.  So, I'm sure there's some of you out there that do the right thing, so, you can find 
[00:35:30]  this on iTunes.  It's called Twittered at as we go to break.  We'll be right back.

[00:48:30]  Wow  It just got mushed  My yeah  My left thumbnail  I have to grow a little longer  Than you would like to  Just to make it look like  It might be a normal thumb  I ought to make it look like  The thumbnail  Yep  There  That looks like a cock  It does look ridiculous  It looks like a  But the foot makes it  The knee  The knee and the foot make it  And then someone's like  Nice black socks  Faggot  Well that was part of my  Picture taking technique  I said well  If I have a black sock  In the picture  That's gonna look weird  You don't think I think  This shit out ahead of time 
[00:49:00]  Let me tell you something  Actually I was playing golf  And I was tired  And I didn't take my socks  That really looks disturbing  Thank you  That's why I took it  It looks like a cock  The fucking  The comments that they just get to leave on here  I  Oh it makes me fucking sick sometimes  Well  Yeah  Yeah  Just shut the fuck up  Shut the fuck up  Can you just shut the fuck up  We get it  Can we all  Yeah  Nice one liner  Can we all  Can we all be in agreement  That the people that  Twitter their food  You don't Twitter food right 
[00:49:30]  Actually I Twittered a sushi dish once  Unless it's funny  So I am a little guilty  Jimmy Twitters food  But it's like  But then he has a good comment  He says what it looks like  Like this looks like a miscarriage  I'm not sure  Miscarriage or  You know food  He actually you know  Has some funny lines  I forget when I forgot  Forget to turn the network  Setting off  Here in the building  Where there is no network  What's with that picture Bob  Please explain  Let me see  Oh that's  Sherrod  Sherrod Small 
[00:50:00]  Black guy  Yeah  Comic very funny  He had that stupid hat on  And he threw it on my head  Out front  And then  He threw it on your head  And Norton  Yeah Norton was there  And he  And took that picture  So I gave him a look  You really like that new black jacket  You're wearing  Because it's in every picture  I've seen this morning  Yeah  It's a nice jacket  It's a new jacket  It's G-Star  I'm not fucking around  You're rocking  Dude let me tell you something  As soon as I was told  I was on the tour  I went shopping  Like white trash  I'm such a fucking piece of white trash 
[00:50:30]  I don't even have the money yet  And I've already spent it  I did that in college too  I got  I found out  I got financial aid  Because of all that fucking juvie shit  I got all this  Like $1,500 a semester  Sure  For books  But I didn't have any books  I was taking art  So I had nothing  So I would get the $1,500  And just go spend it  And I'd come in the next day  With  Like I came in with a briefcase  And a trench coat  Brand  Like I just went to Marshalls  And bought all kinds of shit  Why?  Because I'm a fucking white trash  That rocks though 
[00:51:00]  Now I got  I got to get into  Who I  Who I stopped following  Okay  You stopped following me  First of all  No no  You're still on there  Absolutely  I got Bob Kelly right here  See  Fucking ridiculous show  10,000 motherfuckers  Tour is going to  Be insane  I never understood  Just to finish up  With the Bob Kelly  Dane Cook thing  I never understood  Why Dane didn't have you  Opening up  So I'm glad  It's finally happening  Because Dane Cook  Pulls it off by himself  Obviously 
[00:51:30]  I've seen him many times  In the round  At these massive arenas  Where it's 18,000 people  And it's just Dane in a stool  Yeah  But I'm like  You got Bob Kelly  He's a close friend of yours  And he's hilarious  In his own right  And your comedy  Is different than Dane Cook  It's like  Why not  Give the fans  A little more show  For their money  He actually put in  The guy Al  He got this guy  Al Dabeni  Who we came up with  Who's a funny guy  Who's coming up  We actually started together  Me, him, and Dane  Started in a comedy group together  He fucking bailed out  For a while 
[00:52:00]  He's actually  Having him open now  Instead of Jay Davis  And Al's a funny motherfucker  You know  He's really funny  So there's three of you?  There's three of us  Al goes up first  Opens the show  And then I go out  And do like 20  25  And then Dane goes out  And he's gonna have special  He's actually gonna have special guests  Come out too  I don't know who  But he's gonna have special guests  Pop in along the tour  See that's really smart  Like I said  He can pull it off himself  But why not  Give the fans  Even more of a show  Yeah  It's a great place to be 
[00:52:30]  Plus  Especially now  He has no fucking money  And he could actually  You know  Save a couple shekels  Having me on the fucking tour  So  He's actually paying me  Which is  Thank God  So Ed  Who don't you follow anymore?  I stopped following  Pat from Munaki  What?  Yep  That is a surprise  I thought you would go with Big A  No, no, no  I'm not following Big A  With his bridge pictures  And his food pictures  I don't even  I haven't  I didn't even  Follow Big A ever  Pat from Munaki 
[00:53:00]  Who I love Pat  But he is a Twitter addict  He is addicted to tweeting  It  And the clincher was the other day  When I click on  I go to check out any new tweets  Tweeters  Tweet whatever the hell you want to call them  And an entire iPhone scroll  Before I had to hit more  At the bottom  Was all Pat's head  Every 
[00:53:30]  Averaging a new tweet  Every minute and a half  To two minutes  There was a brand new one  Of  Nothing  Nothing  So I sat  And went  You know  I gotta make a decision  I love Pat  And everything  But  Boof  Stop following  I'm not ready yet  But when I'm done with Twitter  Which I think is gonna be sooner than later  Yeah  I'm gonna twit  Every 30 seconds  Until I watch my followers 
[00:54:00]  Go down to zero  Until everyone  I'm not even joking  I'm going to just twit every  As fast as I can type  And hit update  Is what I'm gonna do  For like  A couple days straight  Until I see the followers  Go to zero  We should all do that  The same day  Yeah  Everybody should just do that  When we officially blow up  Twitter and say  Alright look  It's yesterday's news  We're done  But I can't stop it  Not right now though  You're right  When you update  And you see just the same person's  Same head  Same head  Same head  Or whatever  Over and over again  Just the entire scroll 
[00:54:30]  Dude I mean  From top to bottom  Was nothing but Pat's head  On there  And then I hit more  And there were other people  But a lot of Pat  Still in that  And I was like  You know something  I love the guy  But I gotta stop following him  And then I got that up  But the stop follow button  Is there  And I just went  Well here it goes  So long  Boomf  It's hard though  Boomf  It's hard  Yeah I have to fight it  You told me that  By the beginning  Don't Twitter too much 
[00:55:00]  Well it's  It's hard  It's a weird thing  Because I over tweet at times  And then I under tweet  So if I over tweet  People are like  What the fuck dude  And then if I under tweet  What the fuck dude  You can't win  So you kind of like  Trying to balance it out  There's no winning  You think there's something great  That you're tweeting  Yeah  And you'll get like  And then someone's gonna go  Say something  Just you piece of shit  And you're like  Oh god  I wish there was a way  To filter out  Without deleting somebody  Yeah  Just  Like  I don't wanna block them  Cause you know  I know  You can't do anything

[00:56:00]  That are making their comments  Yes  And you know they're trying to have fun  Throw you under the bus  And there is a fine line  And then there's people  That are obviously assholes  And don't like you  No  So you get rid of those people  Listen to me  Okay  And let the people  Like understand how to keep it fun  Keep it fun  Okay  Back to you dummy  You don't  I guarantee you  You don't delete  I have  I have deleted people  Okay  I have  But I've also deleted people  By mistake  Because you gotta understand  They're not regular  Like O&A fans  I realized this this weekend

And Tri-Tri-Tri-Tri-Angelo.  Good.  I love the second grade.  Tri-Angelo.  Ah.  Hey, this is a...  I don't even know if this is good.  I gotta be honest with you.  We played Let's Twitter That, and then someone suggested...  Actually, Cromwell.  Cromwell.  I'll give Cromwell some credit. 
[01:12:30]  Off the Twitter, he suggested we play Twitter Whore by Lisa Nova.  I don't even know if this song's good.  I didn't feel like previewing it.  If it sucks, just raise your hand and we'll get it off the air, okay?  No, right?  I'm ready to raise my hand.  It's a viral sensation on YouTube.  A few million hits on this one.  Follow me.  It sucks.  Tweet.  Tweet.  Tweet.  Tweet.  Tweet.  Tweet.  Follow me.  Tweet. 
[01:13:00]  Oh, my God.  I like it, to be honest.  Do you?  Tweet.  Because it just, you know, conveys the Twitter whores out there.  Yeah, it really does.  Tweet.  Tweet.  Tweet.  I mean, Twitter's been around for quite a while now, but it's just really started to  kind of really get popular, popular to the point where it's gonna burn out.  I said that.  Yeah.  Shooting Star.  This thing is gonna be a quick one.  It happened way too fast.  Things happen too fast.  Something else will take its place.  I don't know, though, because it's so simple, and it's so simple, there's nothing to it. 
[01:13:30]  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  And when you go to it, it's not ads, it's not all this horse shit, it's right on your  cell phone.  It's kind of true, but you know, when you look at something like Facebook and MySpace,  which is ancient history, it was such a pain in the ass to just the upkeep on it.  They're so mad too.  I'm HTMLing, I'm fucking, you know, putting code in.  I have to put video clips on and slip the video clip into a line of code.  What is that about? 
[01:14:00]  Replace something.  A pain in the ass.  Well, the thing with MySpace too is that they went corporate now with, you know...  Man!  Yeah, man.  Yeah.  You can't, like before you could promote your stuff and it would get to the people.  You can't even send a direct email to anybody.  You can't send it because it was invented to spam people, but they won't let you spam.  That's why it was invented for bands to spam their fans to come out to my shows.  And now you can't even, you can't spam anybody. 
[01:14:30]  You have to send a bulletin, but you have to send it every eight seconds for 24 hours  because yours keeps getting pushed down, pushed down, pushed down.  By fuck, because Sarah's having a fucking birthday party and fucking Bob's dog died.  I can't get fucking anybody to fucking Richmond, Virginia improv.  I got fucking nine ONA fans and that's it.  Fucking Christ.  Tweet.  Tweety.  Follow me.  Tweet me.  Twitter me.  Tweet.  Follow me.  I'm awake now.  I'm brushing my teeth.  Tweet. 
[01:15:00]  I'm checking the mail now.  Now.  Tweet.  Ah, I can't figure out what to wear today.  Tweet.  Just got up.  Naked cereal.  What are you guys doing?  Tweet.  Right now, I'm eating cereal.  I love cereal.  What kind of cereal do you guys like?  Tweet.  Ow, ow, ow.  I stubbed my toe.  I always stubbed my toe.  Oh, I stubbed my freaking toe.  LOL.  Has anyone else stubbed their toe?  Tweet.  OMG.  Brett's 44 was completely brilliant here.  How can you top it with 45?  It's Costco's around today.  He's eating business cards with a cute and a club.  You're totally liking it, also.  You're trying to totally fill my scaping board.  LOL.  Rolfo.  Tweet. 
[01:15:30]  J plus K.  Right now, I'm doing yoga.  Can anyone else like your dog?  I might go live.  I'm thinking about going live.  Here's YouTube links.  Don't forget to subscribe.  Oh, jeez.  I think I might go live.  You want to see me go live?  Don't miss it.  Want to see me go live?  You want to see me go live?  Don't miss it.  You want to see me go live?  Follow me.  Ew.

[01:16:00]  Oh, my God.  OMG.  Maggie just took a shit.  Good girl.  I'm out walking my dog right now.  I'm thinking about going back home right now and stopping walking my dog right now.  That will be my next move.  Back at home now.  Trying to decide what to watch on TV tonight.  Does anybody have any suggestions?  OMG.  Scooby's eating a hot dog?  What did you put on your hot dog, Scooby Liza?  Tatcha?  Mustard?  Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.  WTF?  Oh, Jay.  Ah, Twitter's down, Twitter's down, Twitter's down, Twitter's down. 
[01:16:30]  Oh, I'm G.  Twitter's down.  What are we going to do?  You know what?  Tweet.  I think she blew it though.  The beginning of the song is kind of funny with the, you know, I'm doing this tweet,  I'm doing this tweet.  Tweet.  And then it just gets, it's hard to understand the second half of the song.  Yeah.  I'm putting tweet at the end of all my tweets from now on.  I'm writing tweet.  What is she?  She's kind of...  Did you really?  Yeah.  She's kind of a...  You can fucking own it. 
[01:17:00]  Is she hot?  You should be fucking confident in that.  Well, she did a part two.  You want to hear the part two?  Huh?  I am?  Yeah.  Wow.  I could give a shit, but let's...  We heard part one, we might as well go to part two.  You thought that, but you thought it was good in the beginning, right?  And then it kind of falls apart?  Yeah.  Let's see where she goes.  OMG!  Twitter is down!  What are we going to do?  OMG!  WTF!  OMG!  WTF!  WTF!  OMG!  OMG!  OMG!  Twitter is down!  Twitter is down! 
[01:17:30]  14 million and we still go down!  OMG!  OMG!  OMG!  We're still down!  Shit!  Did this happen on FriendFeed or what?  Maybe I should go to FriendFeed.  FriendFeed!  FriendFeed!  Maybe I should go there.  I don't know.  Damn, we're still down.  Tell me what to do.  FriendFeed?  Oh, shit!  We're back up!  We're live!  Won't you take me too?  Tweet!  Twitter tell!  Tweet!  Won't you take me too?  Tweet!  Twitter tell!  Tweet!  Twitter!  Is that her?  Yeah. 
[01:18:00]  Oh, she's hot.  Yeah.  There's something going on there.  She got amazing cans.  Jesus Christ.  She's got nice.  Titter.  She should be on Titter.  We should start Titter.  Titter.  All it is is tweets of girls' tits.  Tweets of girls' tits.  And you just talk about tits.  Yeah.  Titter.  Mmm.  Mmm.  Titter.  You can't really show nudity on Twitter, right?  Probably not.  I don't know what the protocol is there.  I don't know if you've got to be reported. 
[01:18:30]  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Titter is taken, of course.  Somebody already had the idea.  Any internet idea you could come up with, it's been taken.  It's been taken.  Damn.  Thank you.  Someone has Titter.com?  What the fuck?  And what's on there?  Anything good?  Did you blast fun, Bobby?  No.  No.  I like that the air conditioner vent blows this way and blows the air that way.  Away?  Which is good, yeah.  Hey, I guess we've got to acknowledge that good old B. Arthur. 
[01:19:00]  Not good enough, though.  Oh, shit.  You got it?  You got it?  Good old B. Arthur passed away.  Maud.  When?  Like Saturday night?  Yeah.  Eighty-six years young.  Yeah.  Is it worth playing the news story?  She's dead.  What'd she die of?  Poor poor girl, she was the victim of the Baldonade.  I think she had the big casino.  Look at the picture.  This show, I know, is very visual.  Oh, Jesus.  If we were allowed to do the radio show our way, then you would be able to see this as 
[01:19:30]  well.  Does that really hurt?  No.  I've seen Bea Arthur and her awful Bea Arthur hairdo, but she has amazing boobies.  Like big tits.  Big Helen Muir type boobs.  Those are my favorite type of tits right there.  Really?  No.  I like the nips up a little higher than that, my friend.  Yeah.  What are you talking about, Bob?  I like a little sag.  No, sag.  I used to have a joke.  I used to like, he goes, you have to be able to stick my hand underneath the titty.  My hand has to disappear underneath the titty. 
[01:20:00]  Oh, really?  What?  I like that.  We used to call those girls brick girls, because they could like brick shampoo.  They could hold the bottle under there.  Yeah, under there.  Fuck that.  Look at, this is the guy.  You need perky ones.  This is the sag at Richmond, Virginia.  Doesn't he look like Bea Arthur?  He doesn't.  Does he look exactly like Bea Arthur?  Bea Arthur with that cotton candy hair.  If you squint a little bit, maybe a little bit.  Award-winning actress Bea Arthur has died.  The tall, deep-throated actress starred in such shows as Maud and the Golden Girls 
[01:20:30]  and won Emmys for both.  Long a stage star, Arthur won a Tony in 1966 for her role in the production of Mame.  She first appeared on the small screen in the show All in the Family.  Her wit and razor-sharp comedic delivery soon landed her own show in Maud  that fueled this second half of her career.  She tended to play characters who fought to cast off the traditional restraints women faced,  and she became a standard-bearer for the feminist movement. 
[01:21:00]  Did she?  A family spokesman says Arthur had been suffering from cancer.  He says she died peacefully at her home with her family at her side.  Bea Arthur was 86 years old.  I was never a Bea Arthur fan.  No.  To be honest.  Maud was very good.  And then when she was on All in the Family before they even made a series for Maud,  that was very funny.  Yeah.  She used to really just rip Archie apart.  I hated that Golden Girls.  I hated it.  Golden Girls, I couldn't even fucking watch.  I hated it.  Why would I watch that? 
[01:21:30]  Oh.  Oh, here.  Thank you for being...  Click!  That's me.  Click!  Goodbye.  The second I heard the song start, why would I want to watch these doddering old fools  babbling?  For dusty lesbians?  Yeah.  And then the one talking about how, oh, her sex life.  It's like fucking sex in the city for geriatrics.  Yeah, the one with the fucking...  You know, the fucking Rue McClenahan playing the whore.  Right.  And she's talking about, like, how she got fucked the night before. 
[01:22:00]  And it's like, who's fucking this old bat?  She had the A-cup titties on a barrel chest.  Yeah.  And they had the...  Just the big fucking...  Fucking awful.  The horrible old bat body.  And then you had the mother, who was...  Had some kind of fucking Tourette's, where she just blurred out awful things.  Still getty.  Betty White was a retard.  Betty White's funny.  And, uh...  Betty White is hilarious.  Betty White is funny.  Yeah, but she played a retard on the show. 
[01:22:30]  But they all have hair like they pitched for the Yankees in 1978.  I love the Joe Pepitone.  Spray pink and white.  Yeah.  The gray version of the Joe Pepitone.  Oh, it's all...  Look at it.  It's all parted down the middle.  And apparently...  Showed the length.  Estelle Getty was younger than, um...  All of them.  Bea Arthur.  Yeah.  And they made her the mother.  Like the old broad.  The old broad.  What?  The oldest broad.  You don't think that, uh...  You don't think she was getting any box every night?  That Rue McClenahan talking about how hot it was.  And, oh, well, last night, boy, did I get fucked. 
[01:23:00]  And who's...  With who?  With how many fucking...  With a fire hose of KY jelly.  Yeah.  Shoved in there.  She's doing laundry the next day because his colostomy bag exploded.  Yeah.  Ooh.  They would, too.  It'd be like, you know, oh, I have a male, uh...  You know, a man, a guest is here.  And they'd open the door and some old fucking needin' Viagra motherfucker would come in.  Fucking liver spots all over his forearm.  Yeah.  Hello.  And they'd be like, ooh, well, he's very attractive. 
[01:23:30]  Where'd you find him?  For a show you hated, you saw a lot of the episodes.  I just know what it was about.  Let's go to Matt in Minnesota.  He disagrees.  Matt.  Hey, you guys have gone down this road before.  The Golden Girls is actually a really funny show.  Is it?  These women are...  They're brutal to each other.  They're awful.  Mmm.  Mmm.  Mmm.  You gotta give it a second chance.  It's on the Hallmark Channel, like, 24 hours.  The Hallmark Channel.  Hallmark.  You shouldn't know that.  Oh, God.  Is that a tattoo?  Yeah. 
[01:24:00]  That's an awful, horrible tattoo.  There's a tattoo of the four Golden Girls.  Probably worse than Dave's Sopranos tattoo.  Yeah.  Well, it's a takeoff on...  Thank you for being a friend.  But it's a takeoff on...  What you're missing is a takeoff on Mount Rushmore.  Mount Rushmore.  Oh.  Yeah.  But it's horrible.  Thank you for being a friend.  Ugh.  Who would do that?  So she's...  She's dead.  She's dead.  Well...  They should've done one episode where they just banged a college, a bunch of, like, four 
[01:24:30]  college guys came over and they all got drunk.  Aw.  Young kids were just coming out of the bedrooms.  And just couldn't take the fucking real slamming.  Yeah, but one looks like in Ghostbusters in the library.  The hotel just slimed.  His hair's all mushed down.  He was inside her pussy.  And I hated how Stelgetty would always look off to the side reading her cue cards.  Really?  Yeah.  You should see that?  I remember a line.  I did see the show a few times. 
[01:25:00]  I was not a fan.  I watched it, like, I don't know, to be annoyed.  The old mother, wasn't she like a grumpy...  She was actually funny.  No.  They weren't funny.  Betty White was so contrived.  Betty White's funny.  Betty White's funny, but I don't think she was funny on that show.  I'm sorry.  I don't find it funny.  I did not find that funny.  Let's TiVo a bunch of shows this weekend and do a big party.  A little review.  We're going to take a break, because you're eating breakfast.  Who?  I've got to eat, too.  Danny?  We're all going to eat. 
[01:25:30]  Just a tip, Bobby.  Why don't we play a little clip from your CD?  Give it a little promotion today.  Oh, perfect.  Amazon.com or iTunes.  And what clip are we about to listen to?  I feel like I'm doing panel on Letterman.  Why not?  Well, I don't know.  What did they give you?  Why don't you set this clip up for us?  I don't know.  Yeah, you've got to make believe it.  Oh, really?  I don't know.  It might be the one from the...  I think I'm doing jerking off into my own face.  Something like that.  I think so.  Something like that. 
[01:26:00]  Hot clip to boot.  Thanks.  To boot.  To Bob Kelly from Just The Tip.  I actually hurt my knee again.  I snapped my fucking ACL.  Not in a fucking athletic way at all.  Two inches off the ground.  And my knee went...  Hey, can I be an ankle?  Because he's fat as hell.  Because apparently the doctor I got the first time was fucked up.  He didn't even do the operation.  He did like a shoulder operation on my fucking knee.  Which is ridiculous. 
[01:26:30]  But I got them off the internet.  So it's my fault.  You're not supposed to fucking get a doctor off of Craigslist.  Especially when he had a photo of himself holding his junk.  Like, what's up?  I'll fix your knee and I give full body rubs.  It was so weird though.  Because I was...  This is my second operation.  I was laid up for like a week and a half.  I couldn't...  I was just lying in bed.  Stoned on Percocets.  I was out of my mind.  Fucking just drugged.  And I kept getting these like... 
[01:27:00]  Just random hard-ons.  My penis would just fill up and just...  Touch me.  But I was so stoned.  I couldn't even jerk off.  Because I was just stoned.  Because guys, when we masturbate, we're very visual.  We use...  We use...  You know, like...  We have like a Rolodex of women we've had sex with.  And we just go...  Kathy.  Fucking yes.  Kathy.  Oh, you.  I know you hate me.  But I'm still fucking you.  Aha.  Just fucking... 
[01:27:30]  But I was so stoned.  I really couldn't think of any chicks.  Like I'd get a chick and then I'd fucking think of cartoons right in the middle of it.  Like...  Oh, Kathy and Popeye.  Yeah.  I was lying there and I just kept getting these hard-ons.  And my girl was like, you know, I'll jerk her off if you want.  And I was like, alright, go ahead.  And it's a weird thing.  Because I'm 36.  I haven't been jerked off by a woman since I was like in high school. 
[01:28:00]  Because that we really...  You know, there's a point where you fuck and that's what you do.  You know, girls doing that.  It's like, get the fuck away from me.  Because they want to put cream and shit.  And it's like, I don't use cream.  I'm a professional.  I don't even use all five fingers.  I use these two and my thumb.  La, la, la, la, la.  La, la, la, la, la.  La, la, la, la, la.  La, la, la, la.  La, la, la.  Ooh.  Ooh.  And I shoot it to the left.  But I was so high and I was so horny.  I was like, fuck it.  Go ahead.  So I just lied back. 
[01:28:30]  And she was doing it.  And I was...  It felt awesome too.  I gotta admit.  But I forgot.  Like, I was about to orgasm.  I was about to come.  And you know, guys, when we're gonna orgasm, we just lock our legs.  I actually turned to wood.  I'm like...  You could dive a tank over my chest.  It'd be like a bridge in Iraq if it got blown out.  Go!  Go!  And I just locked up and I forgot she was doing it. 
[01:29:00]  So I looked down and she was just aiming my penis right at my face.  I was like, oh no.  It was too late.  My dick was looking at me like, I got you, motherfucker.  Ha ha.  I got you.  Once again.  And it just went...  It just skidded across my face.  I felt like I won a Nickelodeon award.  I was just like... 
[01:29:30]  And it was like on my lip.  Like it went across.  And I couldn't like...  I had to taste it because I...  Because when you open your mouth, it just goes...  And I was like, oh boy.  And it wasn't that bad.  That's all I have to say.  Apparently, whatever I was eating...  It's not...  Ladies, you're exaggerating is what I'm saying.  It's not that bad.  It's like swimming.  You have to go to the pool, Pete.  I... 
[01:30:00]  It was bad.  Already?  That was a short break.  What the fuck do you want from us?  O.B. and Anthony.  Robert Kelly in for Jim Norton.  Jimmy took a personal day.  He'll be back tomorrow.  Why did he take it so personal?  All's good in Norton's world, so no worries there.  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  We got Sam around.  Oh, actually, I want to go sports.  Any sports fans?  Sports.  Bobby, what do you know about sports?  Let's play a little game.  No, the Yankees sucked a big dick over Boston.  Oh, my God. 
[01:30:30]  Good, good.  Yankees sucked.  Uh...  Red Sox sweep the Yankees to win their 10th game in a row.  I was reading a little article about the new stadiums here in New York, and there's a  bunch of stadiums around the country, so you guys can relate to this, too.  What is the problem, Anthony?  Yes.  With the new Yankee Stadium and the new city field, the Mets Stats?  Yeah!  Yeah!  We got Sam around.  We got Sam around.  Oh, actually, I want to go sports.  Oh, actually, I want to go sports.  Any sports fans?  Sports.  Bobby, what do you know about sports?  Sports.  Bobby, what do you know about sports?  Let's play a little game.  No, the Yankees sucked a big dick over Boston.  Oh, my God.  Good, good.  Yankees sucked.  The problem, Anthony.  Yes.  With the new Yankee Stadium and the new city field, the Mets Stadium, the new Shea Stadium. 
[01:31:00]  What is the problem?  What is the problem?  There is one problem with these new stadiums.  That the teams cannot win in them.  That's sort of true, right?  That everybody has a mustache.  It's something they kind of blew it.  They forgot something?  It has something to do with the design of the stadiums.  These new stadiums.  There's no Uno pieces.  Think.  Think. 
[01:31:30]  They blew it.  Does it have something to do with the distance?  No.  There's no dome?  No.  Does it have something to do with the grass?  I know.  No.  There's no...  When someone hits a home run, a volcano doesn't shoot out lava?  No.  They built it upside down by accident.  That's a who cares story, so don't worry about it.  But I kind of know.  You need to know.  Now I need to know.  In both stadiums?  Yes.  And other stadiums.  They have the same problem in Philly because they have a newer stadium. 
[01:32:00]  All the new stadiums.  The wind.  No.  Anyone?  Anyone?  Anyone?  The seats don't have cushions.  Danny, you want to try?  Huh?  Seats don't have cushions.  No.  Nice seats.  Don't Google your answer.  I'm not.  No third base.  Third base.  That's what somebody said here.  I'm reading.  No third base.  That would be funny.  Great.  You get to second and go, now what?  Where do I go now?  Not enough bathrooms. 
[01:32:30]  Ooh.  No.  Wow.  Yeah.  It's one glaring problem.  Glaring?  Glaring.  The sun shines on the field.  No, no, no.  All right.  Think.  Think.  There's a little puzzle for everybody today.  These stadiums are beautiful.  What's the problem with these new stadiums?  I think I know.  What's Danny?  Is there no Wi-Fi?  No.  I know.  I know.  Yes, Bobby.  Back to you. 
[01:33:00]  You don't know.  I thought it was going to come to me.  Hey, you're a smart man.  What's up?  No lights.  They don't play at night?  Jesus.  No ivy in center field.  Yeah.  They don't have parking.  There's no parking.  I'm surprised Ant doesn't have it because he's a smart man.  I'm trying to figure this out.  Think what the new stadiums have that the old stadiums did not have.  Which would lead to this problem. 
[01:33:30]  Okay.  Concessions.  Something with the concessions.  Good.  Good.  Good.  Not enough waitresses.  Or...  There's no guys running around selling stuff?  No.  Shit.  It's on to it.  The guys can't get to certain places to sell shit.  No.  There's no more beer.  Cold.  Cold, cold, cold, cold.  It is the concessions though.  Warm.  Warmer.  Is it ordering the shit from your seat?  Cold, cold, cold. 
[01:34:00]  They don't have mustard.  Mustard.  Not an ounce of mustard in the whole place.  There's just ketchup.  No mustard.  Do we go to the phones with this one or do you want me to just tell the people?  No.  Concessions.  Good.  Good.  Good.  Good.  Warm.  They...  What?  You can't...  You can't...  You can't...  Concessions?  Pay for it.  You're just about there.  And...  You can't use a credit card.  Oh.  Cold.  Enough with the paying and ordering and all that. 
[01:34:30]  All right.  Something with the concessions.  Yes.  Everything's rotted.  No refrigerators.  No?  Damn it.  Uh...  Well, you want the answer?  No.  Uh...  I'll go with the wrong answer.  Chrissy in Iowa.  Chrissy.  Minorities!  Right, Eric!  No, you idiot.  I...  I have the answer and I have a vagina.  Oh.  Wow.  Did you get it out of the vagina?  You want to be part of my new website, twatter.com?  They usually don't have both. 
[01:35:00]  Yeah.  Twatter.  Twatter.  Is Twatter taking Danny?  Maybe we go with Twatter.  Opie.  Yes, Chrissy.  Okay.  Because of the walls, the outfilled walls are inconsistent.  They're too close.  Ow!  It's concessions!  Why did I take a phone call from abroad when it has something to do with sports?  I'm right!  You're the new stadium.  The walls are too close.  Not enough concessions.  Tell your boyfriend who told you the answer.  He's wrong. 
[01:35:30]  Right.  Thank you, Chrissy.  I'm sorry.  That's wrong.  Too many concessions.  Huh?  Too many concession stands.  No, I'm just fucking babbling.  Well, here's the deal.  You're sort of onto it.  Tom on Long Island.  Tom!  Hey, guys.  Yeah.  Of course you do.  The problem with the stadiums is they all have these beautiful restaurants and shops  where people can buy all kinds of paraphernalia and nobody's sitting in the seats and watching  the games.  And ring the bell.  And not because, you know, it's a racist comment, but because it's the right answer. 
[01:36:00]  Right.  There you go.  The stadiums are so nice and there's so much to do that people are actually not sitting  in the seats to watch the game.  Not watching the game.  They're roaming around the concourse, especially if the game is a who gives a shit game.  Yeah.  It's a place to be seen and you're people watching and you're walking and you're going  to like the bar area and you're hanging out at the bar and you're socializing.  There's a game going on right there.  Oh, okay.  People are not sitting in their seats, especially if you have a bad seat.  That's fucked up. 
[01:36:30]  Well, you know what it is?  The stadiums have all that new stuff.  A friend of mine works in Kansas City on video games for the stadium.  Very good, Tom.  Because nobody watches because this team stinks.  Right.  And they want to bring kids and the kids get bored because the team stinks and nobody shows.  Yeah.  So now you can go out and they can do pitch a fastball, run to third base, play video games  on a big screen, all this horse shit.  Yeah.  You know, like Fenway Park, there's nothing.  You go and you watch the fucking game and there's a pole in front of you.  You know what I mean?  That's the problem right there. 
[01:37:00]  They've made these places so nice.  We got Travis.  Yeah.  But people are not sitting.  I went to the first exhibition game at Yankee Stadium.  Whoop-a-dee-doo.  It was really cool.  But yeah, I spent maybe three innings in my seat and the rest of the time we spent walking  around.  In the bathroom sucking butt.  No, I don't do that anymore.  Oh, okay.  Because you want to check shit out.  Yeah.  They have these nice bars and like, you don't really like hockey, but the Prudential Center  where the Devils play?  That's a great place.  They got all these sick like bar areas and stuff. 
[01:37:30]  And the bar, this is what's ridiculous too.  The bar doesn't even face the ice.  Really?  You could see the ice if you turned around, but if you're hanging out at a bar waiting  to even try to get the attention of a bartender, you're not checking out the game.  Is the game on the TVs?  Yes.  Which makes it even easier.  So you could just sit at the game, but watching it on TV at a bar.  But then you go to your seat maybe for a period and then you're like, you know, let's go  to the bar, have a drink, socialize, you know, do a little people watching.  Let's walk around this beautiful concourse and buy shit. 
[01:38:00]  That is the problem that they didn't think about when building these new stadiums.  They made them too nice that people really want to walk.  And they make the walking very easy.  It's wide.  It walks around the entire stadium.  Is Citi Field like that?  Because I know Philly has that.  I haven't been to Citi Field yet.  Philly has a concourse that you pretty much can walk around the entire stadium.  So people just take loops.  Let's take a loop and see what's going on.  Yankee Stadium put a Yankees museum in their stadium.  Right.  And when are you supposed to check this out? 
[01:38:30]  Whenever you want.  You could build two hours there if you want.  Like, when are you supposed to check it out?  Before the game?  After the game?  It's like, you know what I would do?  No, you go there for the game and then you sit in traffic and leave.  You know what I would do?  If you buy a ticket for the game, you really can't go to the other stuff.  But then allow people that, you know, just want to check out the concourse to go in.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  That would be a little rough to...  I don't know.  But you know, they open that stuff up when the games aren't going on.  I used to go to the...  My uncle had season tickets to the Celtics, the old Boston Garden.  Oh yeah. 
[01:39:00]  You guys remember going there?  Just caverns.  Yeah.  Little round tunnels you had to walk through to get to your seats.  He would go to the bar across the street.  He would give me the tickets, send me up to the seat, and then he'd be like, I'll be  at the bar.  And he would just stay at the bar.  And some retard would come up and be like, these are my seats.  He'd just give his tickets away.  Justin in Tampa saying that's bullshit answer.  Yankees are making excuses.  No, I've watched the Yankees on TV.  Actually, yesterday when I was watching the Mets, they were showing in between innings  shots of hundreds and hundreds of people just walking around the concession area. 
[01:39:30]  That doesn't even look like the ballpark.  No.  What is that?  That's the Jackie Robinson rotunda.  See, they got so much stuff you could do that they didn't think this out.  So they're losing a big percentage of the people that would probably be sitting in their  seats watching the team.  Oh.  That they've made the experience much better.  Can you buy stuff?  You could buy it.  You could buy it.  At these little things you go to?  Whatever the fuck you want.  Yes.  Let's go to Rob in New Orleans. 
[01:40:00]  Rob.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  That's been going on at Saints games for years.  We got three different sections.  You got the low section, the middle section where all of the big expensive tickets are,  and the nosebleed section where the real fans got to sit.  Hell, it's been a social gathering in the middle section for years over there.  You go to everybody's dress to the nines.  Don't get me wrong.  They got some beautiful babes in there, but they couldn't care less about the game.  They take the whole quarter for them to get back from halftime.  I can't get enough of your accent. 
[01:40:30]  I know.  Yeah.  There are accents.  You know, the southern accent.  That New Orleans accent is just amazing.  Where the fuck does that come from?  Where the fuck does that come from?  We're all retarded down here.  Retarded?  It's sort of a French thing in the southern twang.  Right.  More people think I'm from New York than from New Orleans when they don't know,  you know, when they're not from around down here.  Yeah.  Well, yeah.  I got another thing for you guys.  Sure. 
[01:41:00]  Do you realize that on channel 200 that your satellite signal completely goes off between 8 and 10 o'clock and every other channel is fine?  What, our channel, 202?  When I'm listening in the office, between 8 o'clock and 10 o'clock, the signal starts fading.  But believe me, if I want to listen to salsa music from Tijuana loud and clear.  That's weird.  And you're talking about Sirius or XM?  I'm on XM.  I've been on XM from New Orleans.  I kind of heard this a few times.  Really? 
[01:41:30]  Something happens with our channel.  Yeah.  Look, it's a real deal, guys.  Your high channel on 200, it completely fades out.  But every other channel, I got to go to Deep Tracks every day for two, two and a half hours and miss whatever y'all do in the middle.  All right, let me tell you something about Deep Tracks.  You got me going now.  Two hours?  You go to Deep Tracks for a little taste.  No one listens to Deep Tracks for two hours.  Well, it's a departure from all of the debauchery and the dirt y'all are flinging around.  No, I understand that.  There are channels on satellite you go to for a taste, not for the whole meal. 
[01:42:00]  Deep Tracks for two hours?  That's insane.  I'm kind of an older fart.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  All right, guys.  Yeah.  So there's the answer, Ant.  People are not sitting in their seats, especially if the game isn't close.  You're like, ah, let's go explore.  How much are tickets for a Yankees stadium?  $8,000 a game.  Amazing.  $8,000.  That's amazing.  Almost.  They brought that stupid apple.  No, actually, that's a new apple. 
[01:42:30]  Oh, is it?  They brought the old apple over.  Talk about Shea Stadium.  And you can see the old apple, but the one that they put in the stadium is a brand new apple.  Does it look better?  Because the old one looked like paper mache.  Yeah.  But, you know, I don't like the Mets, but that apple was so shitty that it was almost, you  know, like just the coolest thing there.  I like the Mets and I agree with Travis.  The apple stinks.  It stinks, but if you're going to bring it over, you have to bring it.  It doesn't come out of a hat?  No, not anymore.  Not anymore. 
[01:43:00]  It just comes out of the ground.  Oh, that's stupid.  It's got to come out of the hat or you should just not have it.  It's lame.  It should be a big cock that comes out.  Who's with Anthony?  The baldest cock.  Me.  Teams are making money by people buying shit.  The stadiums want people to spend more money in restaurants and bars.  That's Brian in Miami.  Yeah.  Once they buy the ticket, they don't give a shit.  It doesn't matter if they're sitting in the seat or not.  Now they want them to spend more money in the joint.  So what else is going on in sports?  Bobby, what else do you know? 
[01:43:30]  You got the Red Sox winning 10 games in a row?  10 games in a row.  They're doing good.  The Celtics are in it.  And the Bruins are in it.  Whoa.  Celtics barely in it.  They blew that game yesterday.  They did, but this though.  They had a chance to win that fucking thing.  And Kevin Garnett out for the playoffs.  That's going to hurt you.  You're not winning the championship this year, Bobby.  It's either going to be LeBron or Kobe.  Too deep for people?  Probably.  I don't know the basketball.  I cut one and it just smells like...  Oh, I was talking about the Celtics and you made this face like,  yeah, you're right open. 
[01:44:00]  No, it's because you have a sour fart that you're dealing with.  Sour.  That's a good word.  It's sour.  Sour?  What is it with you comics?  They get scared.  It's amazing.  They get scared.  I think the Celtics are still in it.  They're not going to go all the way again.  Losing Kevin Garnett.  You're done.  Well, we'll see what happens.  No, you're done.  There's very strong teams this year.  There's no way you win without Kevin Garnett.  What about the Bruins?  I don't know much about the Bruins.  I'm not going to lie.  I can't sit here and make believe on the Bruins.  I don't know. 
[01:44:30]  I don't either.  Are they even in it?  I don't even know if the Bruins are in the...  I think they are, right?  I have no idea.  I know the Flyers were eliminated.  I know the Rangers are going seven games.  I know the Devils are going seven games.  Travis knows.  The Bruins knocked out the Habs in four games.  Oh, what am I saying?  Yes, we made fun of you.  The number one seed in the East.  You know, Travis, I apologize because we made fun of your stupid Canadians on Friday.  I did know that.  They swept the Canadians.  What am I thinking?  Travis, are you Canadian or are you just married to one?  By marriage, he is.  Yeah, by marriage, he's now Canadian.  He's pretty much given up his American citizenship. 
[01:45:00]  No, I wouldn't do that.  And the pride in this country.  I just like a hockey team.  And being an American.  Wait, wait, Travis.  No.  Travis, what team did you like before you married your wife?  We've been over this and I did not like hockey prior to...  So now you like hockey?  You like their shit sport?  Yeah.  She got me into it.  What am I supposed to do?  You should see him when curling comes on.  He gets a hard on.  Hey, we all like curling when the Olympics...  Yeah.  We all watch.  Fucking moose hunt now.  Oh, yeah.  It's great.  We did like the curling for a while, and he's right.  He's right.  We did...  Well, it was the Olympics. 
[01:45:30]  You know, you gotta get into something.  That stupid curling.  I was like...  The Winter Olympics.  I started watching it every day like, wow, that's kinda...  They have that on the Wii.  Do they really?  No, I'm joking.  They don't.  We know they will.  Curling...  That'd be great if they did.  Just doing that.  Sweeping an imaginary...  Your arm flies off.  You gotta sweep it with your Wiimote.  What else?  I played the Wii, and I actually pulled my shoulder doing that stupid bowling.  Did you?  You gotta really hum it down the...  You actually...  You gotta spin that wrist.  You have to spin the wrist, but it's... 
[01:46:00]  That could cause some problems.  I wish they would make a real bowling alley where you have to hit 99 pins.  Have you ever heard of a ball hitting 99 pins?  No.  It's a game where you go from 10 pins to 20...  Oh, wait.  I did see that one.  Yeah.  What was it?  99, right?  99 pins?  I think it goes up way further than that.  999 or something like that?  Nah, not that much, but it goes up to like in the hundreds of pins.  Something like that.  Dude, it's the best feeling in the world and the best sound.  Just...  You get a strike?  Yeah.  If you get it, you can knock them all down. 
[01:46:30]  That's crazy.  Too impossible.  Two more sports stories.  Jeb in Jersey, if Danny can help us out.  I know you guys don't care about NASCAR.  Oh, really?  It's frozen?  Goddamn.  I heard about this.  Big wreck.  Check out the wreck from the last lap of yesterday's Talladega.  Yeah.  A few people got hurt.  The last fucking lap and I think seven fans got hurt.  I didn't see the crash yet.  We did catch a large predator and a few bathers were injured. 
[01:47:00]  Yeah, some people got hurt.  We'll get that car flipped over and some debris went into the stands.  Well, let's have Stryker represent all NASCAR fans out there.  Stryker!  Hey, morning, boy.  Morning, Stryker.  Yeah, the wreck that you were just talking about in the last lap, like 100 yards from  the finish line, one of the cars went airborne and ended up in the fence that separates  the track from the fans.  The car was completely destroyed and several fans were injured from it.  And the guy walked away, right? 
[01:47:30]  Yeah, the guy walked away.  Who was it?  Afterwards, they interviewed him and he was like, cool about it.  Look, I know a few race car drivers.  Who was it?  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Carl Edwards.  I don't know him.  I don't know that guy.  Yeah, there was a rookie that spun him out, too.  Nice.  Thanks, Stryker.  And then finally, this is the big sports story as far as I'm concerned.  Go ahead, Matt.  Oh, true, yes.  Yes.  Yo.  Go ahead, Matt. 
[01:48:00]  You're on the air.  What do you think about the new Jets quarterback?  I love it, but the Jets gave up pretty much everybody, so this is what usually happens with  the Jets.  They put all their eggs in one basket, they get the big guy, and then the guy gets injured  and then we're fucked for five years.  Although I love it, I'm keeping my fingers crossed here.  Yeah, we got Mark Sanchez.  Did we lose Mangold?  Huh?  Did you lose Mangold?  I don't know.  I know we gave up draft picks and we traded what? 
[01:48:30]  Three guys, right?  Wow, that's a lot of stuff to give up.  We gave up a lot.  Fucking Mangini.  We gave up a lot.  We traded up the fifth overall pick.  No, we traded up to the fifth overall pick, right, and we got Mark Sanchez, the USC quarterback.  Who did the Patriots?  Who did the Patriots?  Nobody.  I didn't watch the draft.  The Jets were pretty much the highlight of the entire draft process.  They're the highlight of everything.  You know, when those NASCAR cars just become airborne, it really gets messy. 
[01:49:00]  Wow.  Did you see that?  That is some wreck.  It's worth checking out.  You guys will find it on your own out there.  Oh, pitted.  So pitted.  Pitted!  Wow.  The cars just took off flying.  He did pit the guy.  Oh, man.  And then look at the other guys going around him.  I love the guys that, like, swerved to the infield.  Oh, now it's on fire.  That shouldn't be too much of a problem.  Fire.  Fire.  Let's say hi to Corey in Michigan.  A little more news on the Wii. 
[01:49:30]  Uh, Corey?  How you doing, guys?  Hey.  Uh, actually I bought the fucking Wii for my kid and I was playing it.  I got, went on that curling.  I was trying to sweep the ice and blew my damn elbow out.  You're saying there is curling for the Wii?  Absolutely.  I think it's on Wii Play or Wii Sports, one or the other.  Wii Canadian.  It's curling hockey and smoking pot.  Blew my elbow out.  Blew my elbow out.  Blew my elbow out.  Out of work for six weeks.  Because of a Wii injury.  Because of a Wii injury. 
[01:50:00]  Alright.  Thank you, Corey.  Thanks, guys.  Alright.  Uh, but I can't figure out how to put that tape there.  What are you trying to say, Danny?  I was just like, I'm sitting watching YouTube videos where people, they can't figure out,  they manage to get their video camcorder somehow into their computer so that they can make a file and upload that file to YouTube.  But they can't figure out how to do that with their television, so they just camcorder their TV sets.  Yeah. 
[01:50:30]  Like, can't you just, like, if you're gonna take the plunge into YouTube, maybe you should take the time to just figure out how to actually capture your video.  Right.  And do it the right way.  I'm sick of watching people video, videotaping their stupid, shitty CRT televisions.  Their TVs.  Stop it.  And you're seeing the interlacing and everything.  Oh, yeah.  It just looks awful.  Oh, that interlacing thing is...  Bullshit.  It is bullshit.  You're progressive, Sam.  I know the players that the Jets gave up were pretty much scrubs.  They gave up three players and two draft picks for Sanchez. 
[01:51:00]  Yes.  We know.  Sanchez, that guy plays dirty, doesn't he?  What's his nickname?  You couldn't wait to get that one out.  Oh, no.  No.  And let's wrap up our sports break by talking about the Iron Sheik.  You're an Iron Sheik fan?  I love the Iron Sheik.  Well, Sam went through the Iron Sheik roast.  They roasted the Iron Sheik.  When?  It might be a little old, but we were just talking about the Iron Sheik and he's coming in Thursday, 
[01:51:30]  so we figured today would be a good day to go over some of the highlights of the Iron Sheik roast.  Right, Sam?  Is he out of his mind, this guy?  Or is it?  Oh, yeah.  He's completely crazy.  He's not right.  How's it going, everybody?  Hey.  Nice farmer's tan.  What's up, cutie?  Or farmer's sunburn.  And why are you only red on one side of your body?  I'm red on both sides.  Not really.  Yeah.  Not really.  What happened to you?  You got blotchy sunburn all over your body.  Yeah, I went to the beach yesterday. 
[01:52:00]  Half your forehead is red.  Why?  You have little nicks all over your arm.  Would you fuck in a rose bush?  I have a cat.  Is that what your cat does?  I have a cat.  I have a cat.  I have a cat.  Yeah, my cat.  My cat.  Scratches me.  It scratches everybody, though.  Why?  That sounds like something you want around the house.  What's a good cat?  Why do you want a pet like that?  His name's Bruiser Brody.  So, obviously, it fits.  Do you kick it?  No.  Sometimes he gets a shake, though. 
[01:52:30]  Give him a good shake.  Yeah.  And then there's a go.  Like the claws come out.  Yeah, no.  It's on that crazy cat face where they put their ears back and their eyes get real big  and they just swatted everything.  He's not like.  Pats are insane animals.  He's not like vicious.  He's just.  I think he's schizophrenic.  Like he's like nice and calm and you're petting him and he's purring.  And then when he gets tired of it, he just turns around, wraps his arms around you.  Oh, that move.  Yeah.  When they hold you with their front.  Look at that cat.  It's amazing. 
[01:53:00]  Dude, is there sound on that?  Dude.  I've seen this.  It's called Very Angry Cat.  It's one of those.  It's the best cat video on the internet.  Cats, I think, are most of us.  Why it only has four out of five stars?  That's people just being assholes.  Oh, stop. 
[01:53:30]  Cat's so pissed it's speaking English.  Oh, is that a pissed off cat?  Oh, my God.  Why does that only have four stars?  Oh, my God.  Stop being a YouTube asshole.  That actually scared me.  Wow.  I mean, it's funny, but it's not funny because that cat is actually just terrified.  It's realistically scared for its life.  It's in a cage at the shelter and it knows.  So those are the people.  It smells to death.  Animal activists get all mad. 
[01:54:00]  Yeah, those are the people giving it one star.  Yeah, it smells to death and knows, all right, I'm next.  Great.  Get out of this fucking cage.  Cat's got a couple of moves that are really amazing.  The one where they do use their front claws to hold your arm and then they do that bunny  hop thing on their back with their back claws and just shred you.  They shred you.  He never does that.  He does this move like we've got a chair with a cover over it.  And so it drapes.  So he likes to hide under the chair so you can't see him.  And then anytime anybody walks by, he just jumps out and swats and then runs back. 
[01:54:30]  He's an asshole.  See that?  Yeah, he's just a dickhead.  That sucks.  I had an asshole cat.  They suck.  You can either have a cool cat or an asshole cat.  She's a dickhead.  He's just pulling pranks.  Right.  Like I caught prankster.  Yeah.  My girlfriend was walking, you know, through the hall there.  And all of a sudden the cat just runs by her and jumps up in the air.  And he missed her, but he just tried to swat her with one paw.  Mm-hmm.  We're watching a montage of asshole cats, by the way. 
[01:55:00]  My cat's not that bad.  No, your cat's an asshole.  What I like about ants move with the hind legs, when the cat does that to you, you're  thinking, when the fuck is my cat working on its quads?  What the?  Yeah.  It's a cat, come on, scratch the baby.  No.  I got this, yeah, when the hell is a cat actually working out there?  What the?  It's a montage of cats there, Bobby.  There's also-  It's fun stuff.  What the? 
[01:55:30]  There's a cat hissing and attacking itself at a mirror.  Yeah.  Which is real stupid.  Cats is stupid.  You know what?  Most of these cats that we're seeing in this cat montage, it's all catnip.  You give them a little catnip and then hit record on your fucking camera.  The other move, the other great move a cat will do is if you're holding a cat, much like 
[01:56:00]  you would hold a baby, you're cradling the cat and then holding its back, and then it  decides it's going to crawl up your shoulder and down your back.  The worst thing you could do is try to hold it where it is, because it will dig its front  claws into your shoulder blade, trying to get away from you over your back.  And it's also like, since you're standing up straight, it decides to crawl down your  back, and instead of just jumping off at the shoulder, it has to crawl down by just 
[01:56:30]  digging claws in all the way down.  The cat on the fan.  The cat on the fan, it smashed into the wall.  Danny, what's the search on this?  Well, you're never going to believe this, guys, but you've got to go to YouTube and  type in funny cats.  Funny cats.  That's it.  Funny cats on YouTube.  Yeah, Travis is alerting me.  It's the video, if you can't find it.  It's the one with 21 million views.  Holy shit.  Is it really that high?  Wow.  People love their cats on the internet.  I want to thank Kevin from Connecticut.  He writes, what about that asshole guy who screamed at his cat, I will end you? 
[01:57:00]  Where is that audio?  Yeah, that guy's sweet.  We haven't played that in a while.  What is that?  You've never heard the-  Oh, I don't think so.  I think E-Rock's got it on disc.  I want the audio if we have it.  Guy's yelling at his cat like it's a battered wife.  Oh, listen to this, Bobby.  Cat's just sitting there, just-  Get the fuck down!  Fucking jump!  Jump!  Get the fuck down from there! 
[01:57:30]  Fucking jump!  Jump!  Do it, you bitch!  Do it!  Jump!  Do it, you bitch!  Do it!  Jump!  Do it!  Do it!  Do it!  Jump!  Do it!  You fucking bitch!  Jump!  DO IT! YOU FUCKING PUSSY!  JUMP!

I HEARD THAT  YA!  that well he i mean he was the one that was in the car crash and it was the last lap so he's like  this i'm gonna run to the finish line like they did in talladega nights why not just um do that  the whole race well then you don't have to worry about pit stops but then you'll be in last place 
[02:00:30]  higher changes guaranteed last but if every car crashes guaranteed last place every time  slow and steady wins the race they say the tortoise beat the hair  oh man that's screaming at the cat video i will rape you i will rape you what a creep it's only  half i mean you know playing it on the air is fun but i mean you really got to see these cats like  reactions and faces yeah cat yelling it's called um that's the type of video i enjoy way more than  the montage of the cats doing silly cute things yeah why doesn't that have like 21 million hits

[02:11:00]  later i want to say brian blair you're not mr bob bachler class you're not my class but still you  lucky lucky have such a jim duggan punch of michigan 93 000 people they saw it i had you in the camera  class i was ready to break his back make him humble but brian blair and still i respect you 
[02:11:30]  till you come my roast and but you know and a god though and all my recipes know you not my class  i can't hear how about a handshake i just came here to apologize and i just came here i just came  here i just came here she got a reset i just got a football thank you all right that's it wow that was 
[02:12:00]  real he told him fuck off the iron cheek decided to slap him in his head he just saying fuck off he  slapped him in the face and said fuck off but that's real that's not kidding around well i mean he really  slapped him like what kind of work could it be i mean really think about it the guy what is the guy  doing it's true he slapped him for real yeah is the the bonus features worth playing yeah because uh  you got bonus features in it she grossed yeah how long is the bathroom from this long hallway like 
[02:12:30]  we're gonna go in a couple minutes is there a bathroom close though no i'll show you where it is  you said not even not at all it's ridiculous all right i'll show you okay but no what yes they should  have more than one bathroom this place you should have your own bathroom right here we should have  our own uh bonus features go ahead sam well yeah scott hall uh razor ramon has had some uh very heavy  substance abuse problems uh-huh and he was there and he was heckling the comics the whole time and 
[02:13:00]  the wrestlers uh he was drunk and then uh he was drunk yeah comedian jimmy graham made an owen hart joke  uh-oh how are you making an owen hart joke wow yeah at a wrestling thing yeah i think he said  still a little a little touchy yeah to a lot of people he said uh bill after was there who was  an old wrestling magazine guy and he said bill after was as dead as owen hart oh at which point  scott hall decided to stumble up to the stage and start threatening jimmy graham  and grabbed the mic from him and had this to say 
[02:13:30]  that's what i'd like to say everybody bow their head right now and ask god to say hi to owen hart 
[02:14:00]  who's in heaven looking down on us and some jabroni gotta make jokes about owen hart you need some new  material you goof  you couldn't beat owen hart's on your owen hart's meat on your best day 
[02:14:30]  what what's that i don't know this is like listening to a caveman convention  this is like caveman well a caveman convention  scott hall says and then he he continued to like uh stay in the audience and they couldn't get him to  leave and they had to call police and it was this whole ordeal so then they had for real or for no  that one i don't i don't know what to believe anymore the scott hall thing i don't like about  wrestling i don't know where the fucking i would like them because we're sort of in on it now so it's 
[02:15:00]  like all right real not real just let me know just a quick real oh cool this is real in my work in my  expert opinion the brian blair thing not real this was real because scott hall is a legitimate  alcoholic and this added nothing to the program so that's how you figure it out i like that and uh  sam while while you're in here because you're the wrestling expert jabroni who started the whole  jabroni thing oh come on the rock no people were using it in the industry before the rock the rock 
[02:15:30]  was the first guy to use it on television so the rock popularized it but it used to be an  industry term really and what did it mean just like a jobber like uh the you know the preliminary  guys like the guys who didn't really they use their real names oh yeah squash guys they've come  out that was before it was all superstars right i used i used to hate the squash guys yeah they  would come out tights yeah the whole thing though like yeah with the straps like yeah yeah like he's a  real wrestler and sneakers because he couldn't afford the boots yeah and his name was just like 
[02:16:00]  steve thomas and you know the other guy was dressed up like some kind of animal like i guess i know  who's gonna win this match and then well at first the other guy would start winning right you know  he would start winning against the big superstar and he'd be like oh my god how is this and he was  always that happy to be there guy like hey yeah running around the ring all like yeah he'd be like  yeah here i am it's legit it's real to me god damn it when mick foley was young he was he did  a couple of those matches for dwf really he was cactus jack at the time and he came in they were 
[02:16:30]  like what's your name he was like i'm cactus jack and they were like no no no no you can't be cactus  jack what's your last name and he was like foley and he's like all right you're jack foley oh and  jack foley and he was a squasher they're called yeah you're just like a squash guy but yeah that's  a squash guy that's called a jobber hence jabroni jabroni very good so we got the iron chic responding  to uh what scott hall just did yeah this is a good clip caveman but i blew it by saying caveman caveman 
[02:17:00]  convention scott hall you tried to get a smart with me and you did a bad thing because all my wrestling  fans know and all the boys know you make a jack of yourself you are lowlife piece of garbage and you  try to steal the show next to the orange chic but i want to let you know scott hall you go ask your  partner kevin nash and my good friend says sebaceous they know in there in the georgia uh nwa 
[02:17:30]  and the turner station everybody know you are a fucking jabroni piece of garbage and i'm gonna make  you worse than bram blair i wish soon or late anywhere i saw you do you want to get a smart again with me  this time i suplex you i put you in the camel clutch i break your back and i'm gonna make you 
[02:18:00]  fucking suffer after that i'm gonna fuck your ass make you humble kevin nash fuck you you are  pieces of shit garbage soon or late scott hall scott hall not kevin nash scott hall scott hall i'm sorry  kevin nash is a good friend of mine jesus now he's calling out friends and he doesn't even realize he is a 
[02:18:30]  real problem huh yeah he doesn't know what's real and fake anymore barry horowitz uh who is this that  was one of the all-time best uh jobbers i remember he would every week this guy would come out in his  sequin robe and he had a hand it was like a sequin hand on the back of like this cape and he would come  out he waved the crowd and he'd give himself a pat on the back and that was just a gimmick yeah  oh what a stupid gimmick they tried to uh i don't like that gimmick though that's not bad  they tried to turn him into a good guy like they gave him the one victory because everybody knew 
[02:19:00]  barry horowitz the jobber and they gave him the one victory and everybody goes barry horowitz finally  won so they gave him music and everything but it was just havanagila he just came down to havanagila  okay you're jew and he had a star of david on his side and they're like here's your new gimmick  you're a jew you're a jew great all right thank you sam but yeah the uh the on the prep thing  because the iron cheek is coming in later this week and one of the bullet points his manager sent 
[02:19:30]  me was that the iron cheek has a problem with substances and he prefers to buy drugs overpaying  his bills oh so that might be one reason why he talks funny oh wow we're gonna have fun with him  what day is he in thursday thursday nice cool we got bob kelly filling in for uh jimmy bobby's on  tour with dane cook anything else we're promoting bobby no just that's great i want to get one of  those and every time i go on stage at the end i want to do that can you get me one of those ropes 
[02:20:00]  i have to get it for you i thought we're friends i can't buy that for myself also on the way at  taya parker who won uh rock of love bus our friend oh really she's done the show many times and  she kind of hinted last time she was on that she did very very well oh okay she won the whole thing  she's coming in to say hi today yeah she'll be here in i don't know she was on rock a love bus  she won it she won the whole thing yeah so i guess she's gonna marry brent michaels right  that's how it works out in the end that works that didn't happen the first season  goldberg jew against jews yeah but uh i just gotta tell you this there's 30 seconds left in this clip 
[02:20:30]  so yeah this match can't last very long this can't last very long he's he's patting himself on the  back goldberg is behind him and oh and just torpedoes him with his head what would you do if  goldberg was coming at you like that goldberg's big finishing move i guess which is the uh variation  of any kind of the jackhammer sort of yeah no he actually flips him last second which the wrestlers  are like please don't up i don't feel like being paralyzed what an animal he was he has to be 
[02:21:00]  the worst mma announcer on the planet he gets into the ring and stutters and stammers and  is trying to read he stinks he's the worst mma announcer on the planet earth i love that the  rock versus the brooklyn brawler like the brooklyn brawl brawler would win against the rock  or anybody the rock was the baddest motherfucker he was the best of all time but then that year  was brawler the year was great with uh you know stone cold and and the rock and why would the 
[02:21:30]  brooklyn brawler be so cocky walking out when he loses every single match do you remember when the  rock came back for a minute and he was he had the guitar and he was singing he was just trashing the  town he was in the cleveland one he just trashed shitty cleveland yes can we find that for after the  god that makes me laugh he was uh he just knew that he was gonna move on from wrestling he was just  too good god he was funny man uh we're gonna take a break we had gary coleman in on friday i heard i  heard it was fucking hilarious it was really good we got some highlights so it's a quick highlight 
[02:22:00]  reel here clip or what there's a bitter little motherfucker a bitter little yeah steven derek  did a little something with the audio and here it is opium anthony it's time for celebrity confessions  with gary coleman the used to be cute actor who portrayed arnold on the sitcom different strokes  hell i was tired of the show after the third season i was like you are this is boring  jesus really it's boring and it's you know it's just it's stale it's not funny anymore okay can i  do something else now we're just going to get scripts like those very special episodes where 
[02:22:30]  you're just like jesus christ yes comedy show and some celebrity comes in well the big one of course  was the first lady at the time uh nancy reagan you know what i was sick of that episode after the  third day that was the whole anti-drug message that was going on that just say no yeah like that  this 41 year old munchkin is now sustaining himself with a steady day job public appearances  and part-time acting gigs hey you uh i mean it's time of knowledge a lot a lot of the stuff that would  be private or whatever because you know it became very public suing your parents it's on dvd already 
[02:23:00]  this this yeah i guess this might be advanced copies dvd of what the latest project yeah yeah  i didn't i swear to god it's going to retire me really yeah it was done until we did it we did it  in texas and and and and i just don't have anything really good to say about it 
[02:23:30]  god bless you fortunately gary offsets his anger issues with an extensive collection of firearms things  like uh ak-47s and and brand guns and you feel like you could just kill everybody  you must be like oh the world man i'm going to town oh man 200 shots a second i'm just like oh just  please give me that but watch out hollywood decades of being put through the tabloid ringer has taken 
[02:24:00]  its toll on gary coleman a lot of questions i'm not such an honest celebrity other celebrities  bother me really i wish i could just grenade their ass every time they do something stupid don't let  that contempt fool you kids gary coleman is very approachable because he knows he owes his success  to his fans i saw a picture on the back of season two because i i i got of course i was going to ask you  to sign it i was very jealous there's a picture of you with all right yeah i'm going to break off 
[02:24:30]  parts of you if you make me sign a piece of shit i knew it i said the same you know what i i will  respect that this has been celebrity confessions with gary coleman well you know it i could get  god one of my problems with me is i am honest i am candid and i have a lot of candor and the only  reason i'm really here with you right now is because they have a check waiting for me  oh p and anthony robert kelly just want to remind uh the fine folks out there that right after the 
[02:25:00]  show i marched down that very long hallway and uh and push uh upload on the latest clip from our real  rock tv show that was done a mural i don't know about 11 years ago it's anthony practicing to be a mind  it will be up before 11 o'clock today great yes i cannot wait this one uh see that horror show  you might want to turn off all electronic devices because god how embarrassing the reaction on this 
[02:25:30]  one's gonna be pretty big how what are you guys doing uh doing a little app talk a little app trading  i've noticed this happens a lot now that there's more and more apps uh coming up um you you discuss  some more with your iphone uh compatriots there what was the apple you told me again um self  portrait which is it's that one's valuable that's that's yeah that one's a waste of time yeah that  was a good one if you ever try to take a picture of yourself with the iphone you have to line your 
[02:26:00]  finger up uh behind it because now the lens is on the opposite side of all the buttons which is still  the virtual buttons so when you're trying to hit the uh camera uh the shutter button the way you have  to hold the iphone is very precarious it shakes a lot uh with self-portrait you can go anywhere from  five i think to 20 seconds or something like that uh where you hit take photo and then you'll feel it 
[02:26:30]  vibrate and then on the fifth vibrate let's stay right after it it takes the picture so you can  hold the camera with your hand nice and steady out like that you don't have to click the button  yourself great app this is my app pick of the day as soon as you push the button it shakes the  fucking it shakes and the way you have to hold it to push the button you're only holding it between  your thumb and forefinger and your forefinger is the one that's uh the appointed finger is the one  that's got to like click the photo so it really sucks a dick this is what i do to get the new 
[02:27:00]  apps you know when they have the app commercial on yeah i pause it and if you look at the apps  around it get out of smart bob kelly you can see the really badass fucking apps that only the apple  fucking genius guys have they're the ones using it yeah pause the apple app commercials i'm gonna get  switchblade too have you got switchblade what's switchblade that's a free self-defense class  how does that work it teaches you moves on your phone yeah on your phone huh you shake it and it 
[02:27:30]  brings up different scenarios like getting mugged from behind i don't know oh let's see if this works  self-portrait that's a good one photo gene is a good one too for twitter because you can put  captions thought bubbles and cropped photos and then twitter how about how about this have you have you  seen this one yet what is that what is that bob kelly is a homo how did you get my dad app

[02:49:30]  on oh what for a handy i'm just talking about the dry hump oh the dry hump you guys are killing  me try to get it right in right in the vag canal this is so 10th grade right now i know it is really  like we're not in 10th grade anymore all right let's go down to fifth grade okay so i'm blowing my  friend frankie i'm sucking his cock because i don't know what a dick is and then cotton candy came out it  wasn't like cum but it was like like airy like it was almost like cotton candy no it tasted like uh 
[02:50:00]  actually fish eggs and puke if more stuff tasted like cotton candy i'd be all about that but  they're gonna change like what what the guy drinks or eats like if i had cranberry juice  wouldn't it taste fruity or if i guess i'm a cum tasting connoisseur right now yeah i don't know  well you brought it up i didn't bring it up actually yeah you said no you said it tasted like  cotton candy or it was like cotton candy so i was talking consistency oh i see what does cum taste 
[02:50:30]  like oh jesus does it taste like an apple that's been in a pool for two weeks  oh seriously what does it taste like or is it different it depends it depends all right well  give us a few things that can you guys seriously i'm trying to think of what you can describe  out there this is an interesting conversation describe the taste of that i don't know just how  does it taste how does it taste it just depends i don't like it does depend on what somebody eats i 
[02:51:00]  think you know i had like a really healthy health food like boyfriend once and it didn't taste like  anything does your it was like air it's like air i'm just saying it didn't have a flavor it was  it tastes like coffee like a starbucks we're not gonna we're not gonna move on unless you give us a  flavor now what does it taste like there's nothing to compare it to it tastes like cum cum has its own  flavor yeah but does it taste you know those harry potter jelly beans that like taste like  shit and grass and puke have you seen these yeah they should have one it's just cum flavored then you 
[02:51:30]  would know what it tasted like it's like the popcorn jelly belly it has its own flavor does the first  like is it like a like a a wine like the little pre-sem the clear stuff that comes that different  taste than the actual baby chunks at the end that's a good question you know what i mean no i really  don't like the first the pre-cum the the little spritzer that comes out first that's clear  you guys have so many porn stars in here that are probably better equipped to answer this 
[02:52:00]  question i'm sorry well the last time tay was in uh what's her name cry you were part of that  famous show she made somebody cry i didn't make anybody cry but we didn't know we were making  somebody cry right yes you did well you totally knew you're making somebody cry well maybe we pushed  it a little bit when we knew she was falling apart he did no we didn't no no no no no no where  there was like troughs of people looking through the windows we didn't know that she was so sensitive  to what we were talking about and then when we realized then we knew we had it was the point of 
[02:52:30]  no return you'd already like jumped in with both feet might as well go with this yes but we and i  loved how he tried to like i tried to totally make it things over it was so cute it wasn't our intentions  to have her cry and run out of here like she felt bad you know yeah but in hindsight are you happy  that it went down like that or do you wish it would have gone differently it made for great radio  that's all i care about in the end laney sent me my publicist sent me the uh the audio and i still  haven't like gotten effed up enough to listen to it she was in recently you have a publicist and she

[02:55:30]  taste like stop it i wouldn't know just yeah because the show's a sham no it's not that's  that's horrible i thought you guys liked him we we said the same stuff to him and he was nodding like  all right well what do you you know well he didn't get me a second or third career and he's doing very  well and it it did very well for you you got a lot of exposure i have a new boyfriend that's the only  reason i went on the show you really don't let's be honest are you still going out with the old  boyfriend where are we at what old boyfriend brett michaels you brought some old boyfriend on the 
[02:56:00]  show i never brought a boyfriend on the show they brought the old they brought the old  boyfriends i thought you meant on your show i'm like i've never had a boy on this show oh the exes  episode yeah i love that old boyfriend he's great you still go out with him no i don't who are you  going out with i'm going out with brett michaels you guys i am not dating anyone but brett it's not  exclusive like i'm sure that if he wanted to freak out when was the last time you saw the reunion 
[02:56:30]  show just aired last sunday and we've seen each other once since the reunion show because we  weren't allowed to see each other before how long so when was the last time you saw him when it was  when did you take the reunion show um i don't remember a couple months ago no it wasn't a couple  months ago how long no it was not it was no it wasn't they taped the reunion show and it aired the  next sunday they had one week to edit it all right so but you taped it a while ago and you've only seen  it once since no we didn't take it a while ago it was on the week last sunday and it taped the week 
[02:57:00]  before that so it's been two weeks since it since it taped and we've seen each other once oh she's  getting mad i like i am getting mad because you're telling me when it taped and it's no that's not true  like i'm not here to lie to you i'm telling you the truth yeah opie i've always been honest with you  i've been naked flavor flames hanging out with those broads after his thing it's good tv though  can i ask a question though because i was i watched season one okay let me ask you a question what 
[02:57:30]  makes me have to be a sham like why wouldn't brett michaels want to date me oh man can i say because  i watched season one of the show season two yeah and now there's a there's a bus i was a big fan of  the first i haven't seen why this one yet why do the relationships break up conveniently so they can  film another season it's silly i'm not saying maybe we love you you're initially planned you're  a friend of the show we're happy that you got exposure but the show is a sham it's but maybe  he found love in the sham you never know that's like what makes me not suited you know yeah no 
[02:58:00]  saying i think i'm a perfect girl he would be lucky honestly he would be a lie detector hold on he  would be lucky to go out with you for real but he's way better than last the the season uh the rock of  love she's way better when are you gonna see that last girl of all the seasons that he's had so far  i mean i'd like to think like i'm very well suited for him i mean i'm a center cold he's a rock star  i mean there's a great we have a great chemistry and lots of things in common you're absolutely  right and i was cheering for you the whole time like i hope tayya wins because she's been on our 
[02:58:30]  show we didn't know any of the other girls yeah you want now this will now this will lead to  something else for you and then maybe you'll admit that yeah it was good it wasn't a sham and  where could it lead me where could it lead me it led me to when are you gonna see him next um we  actually just talked and i think i'm gonna see him second week of may in la that's a wow no it's not  it's two weeks away it's like bobby looked right at his watch like have you seen the man's schedule 
[02:59:00]  it's crazy your schedule is crazy too though yeah you're promoting this and you're gonna promote  the show where you at where you at you think it could be girlfriend and girlfriend and barely  see each other that's how it works they're professional people you don't want to rock  the boat what i'm just saying bobby where are you at with this we're definitely trying to see each  other if he didn't want to see him in 18 days right if he was just like it's a sham he just wouldn't  call and get right on the phone steve get right on the phone steve uh well you have his number 
[02:59:30]  give me uh britt's number so we can call it yeah he would love if i gave out his like personal  number do you show me his number in your phone i don't have my phone on me but if laney wants  to bring in my purse i'd be more than happy to show you so um can i ask you a question but you  you guys you guys are in like you're not in love you're just in like you love it we're definitely  in serious like yes good cop all right you guys are so bad like if i would have known you guys were  gonna like completely make a sham out of my favorite relationship in the last six years really is it 
[03:00:00]  really is it really your favorite in the last six years yeah i have really been unlucky in love and  so i get offended at the notion that you guys think that this could not work out how are you  unlucky in love what happens yeah i just worked a lot i mean you know i've been i went on the show i  was finally at a point in my life where i felt like hey you know i'm gonna give it a shot i'd actually  had tried to meet brett like without going on the show really yeah seriously when like a lot  like like many times in like the last year like after season i think it was after season one when 
[03:00:30]  him and jess were like openly like it's no way and then he did season two obviously with amber and i  think i reached out one more time after that before they announced rock of love three and i mean  his camp like acknowledges that there were people from my camp that reached out to him so going on the  show is not like oh i want to be on a reality show like if they would have offered me like flavor of  love or one of the other shows i wouldn't have done it i mean i went on the show because i wanted  to meet him i understand that right the other girls hated you too huh that's okay why do you hate me 
[03:01:00]  because i won and they knew i was gonna well there was there was one the psycho girl on the one before  that right where's the redhead the redhead yeah there's a psycho on what was her name again she's  been on a bunch of reality what happened to the blonde lady the the from the original one the  blonde girl heather is her name the stripper from vegas she was on our episode she was doing the  interrogation of the exes so she was on our episode too did she fuck with you you know what 
[03:01:30]  she did and i was a little shocked because i expected it to be reversed i expected amber to  not like me and i expected heather to rally along with me because we are kind of from like the same  you know like she went through season one constantly being harassed for being a stripper and nobody would  let it go and i was kind of dealing with the same thing on my season with the penthouse thing  and people just would not let it go and so i kind of assumed that she would understand and she kind  of you know she kind of went after me which you know we've actually spoken since and you know we've 
[03:02:00]  we totally get along she's great like so i think that there is a lot of antagonizing for drama and  stuff so i definitely think that they wanted to kind of blindside me making me think that i that heather  would be you know an ally you know what i mean so you know i think they just did it to throw me  off because she's a really cool chick like i like heather she's crazy the redhead on the season one  i believe was season two the redhead crazy man lacy thank you yeah she was that she was 
[03:02:30]  fucking she rocked she was out of her mind yeah she was on this season two she did the hockey episode  are you doing did she mess with you she didn't she was actually very nice to me which was also kind  of scary because i didn't expect that so i don't are you doing rock of love four i'm not doing rock  of love four because there isn't a rock of love four i think they announced it right no they did i  swear to god no they didn't i swear to god oh so that's it your boyfriend and girlfriend there's  not going to be another i'm not saying there's not going to be another rock of love i'm not brett if 
[03:03:00]  he wants to do another rock of love four then we had to feel bad because he'd be you know with other  girls and everything did you sign the contract because we we we love you we know that this gave  you a lot of great exposure that's all and if we could get some nice info out of you today it'd be  beautiful i will give you all the info you want but i'm not going to say that my number  x relationship is a scam because i do care about his official would you feel bad though if he was like  going to other girls listen if there was a rock of love for i would be the first to know because

[03:12:30]  recognition must have went way up well yeah now it encompasses like 15 year old boys and 12 year  old girls so it didn't it didn't do that before you are yeah i would say my fan base dropped to  like the a more teenage realm now which is kind of a little bit weird for me because i've always  been very sheltering of myself from the younger generation just because of what i do so i'm a  little bit torn you know having a younger fan base because i don't you know i definitely don't 
[03:13:00]  want to like sway any young girls or lead them down the wrong path oh please do i don't need more  i don't want to do that we need more young girls that are willing to take the ones that are going  to do it are going to do it they don't need my help thing we need girls sexting more oh yeah  naked pictures of themselves and uh send it to their boyfriends of a week and then their boyfriend  of a week and a half breaks up with them and sends them to all his friends yeah and for some reason  they're all over the internet but i never get to see him isn't that horrible all right so we don't 
[03:13:30]  know where he has a Bentley that's okay well let's just slide i think he does have a Bentley but i  don't know that that was his Bentley or not like i don't think any girl i've known knows that i have  a shelby oh that's right i meant every girl i know knows i have a shelby  like i don't know if that's intriguing or creepy or what i love it i was bragging about my gps and 
[03:14:00]  my honda civic yeah it's a dps you hit the button it tells you where to go all right can we move on  to other things that people want to know about of course move on to whatever is it is it a wig or not  it's not a wig he does extensions he has said openly that he wears extensions he has admitted that on  his own he has hair in the front he is not bald i have seen him without the bandana he takes the  bandana off a lot on the show and it's like his image so they like get mad and make him put it back  bobby says that it looks kind of what did you say it looks like horse hair or something throw me out of

[03:15:30]  what this leads to for you what do you think it leads to to be honest i'm just i you know i'm under  contract with penthouse right now so you know i'm constant that's the thing is of all the girls  i went home and went back to my job like my life has not changed that much she's a model i mean i'm  contracted for pet of the year for the next you know for the next 10 months so i'm on a tour you  know visiting the penthouse clubs meeting my fans i mean i'm obligated to them for the next 10 months and

[03:17:30]  the joke and i would hate to see that happen you know well well then it's important that you guys  work out the uh the breakup storyline so it's it's good for everybody wow laney what do you think  happens in the end i don't know if it's possible for a guy like brett to settle down with anyone  at this point i fucking love laney i've told her that i've told her that i hope it works but i don't  think it's possible no laney tries to keep me you know she she she doesn't want my heart working  how's he gonna go from being on the road and all this stuff to like banging balls right now i mean 
[03:18:00]  the good part is that she's always on the road too even before she became a pet she travels just as  much as he does so i mean that's one thing they do share you're good you know you you know you you  guys are so wait why is intern david poking his head in did you have a little something with intern  david last time did i what i don't know we had you doing stuff what did i do i didn't do anything with  david he uh he uh i think he got a lap dance david that wasn't last time that was like a long time

Penthouse may issue.  You got pet of the year, Taya Parker, rocks the bus with Bret Michaels, right-hand man.  Whatever that means.  Oh, because John did the interview.  Yes.  Okay.  That is correct, sir.  Sweet dreams.  You want to know what?  Sweet dreams.  Doing shows like this is why nobody believes that I'm classy. 
[04:08:30]  You'll be back.  You'll be back.  I get a lot of mail from people that don't believe that I'm a classy girl, like I portrayed  on Rock of Love Bus, and this is why.  They don't believe me.  Oh, I'll be.  What?  I thought the show was over.  Oh.  It is.  I said I love you.  Okay.  I think you're just the sweetest little thing.  I want to put you in my pocket and take you with me so you're always close to me.  Sam, what do you say?  A little...  This is why we want Tay to leave the studio. 
[04:09:00]  I don't think I appreciate that David is not saying Tay.  Get up and leave.  There's a perfect down.  Okay, you guys are scaring me.  Stop.  Wow, that was probably one of the most despicable interviews I've ever been party to. 
[04:09:30]  You loved it, though.  It was hysterical.  Step out of your dumb character that you're doing today.  You loved it more than anything.  Oh, please.  All right.  Thank you.  I adored what was going on.  I have to play good cop sometimes.  Oh, Ant's on Red Eye tonight.  Red Eye this evening. 
[04:10:00]  Let me watch that tonight.  DVR it because it is at three in the morning, but I tape it at like eight or something.  All right, good.  Good, good.  But it's going to be a lot of fun.  All right, guys.  That was fun for...  No Tay at Radio Show today.  We're too late now.  Next time.  Now it's late.  All right.  All right.  All right.  That was fun.  Bunch of sick motherfuckers.  Fucking weird.  Oh, it's still on.  Is it still on, Luke?  Oh.  How come we did a Friday show on a Monday?

You're going to have to ride this show out for a day or two.  We'll be back to the good radio Wednesday.  Bill Burr tomorrow.  Oh, Bill Burr's in.  Nice.  Beely, beely.  And in a matter of minutes, you'll be able to find Anthony practicing to be a mime on YouTube.  Oh, wow.  I promise the people, Ant.  I'm walking down the hall to upload that video.  Yeah.  From the Real Rock TV days, 11 years ago, Anthony practicing to be a mime.
