<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show opened with a vulgar tirade against Osama Bin Laden, immediately followed by the announcement of "Whip-em-out Wednesday," a segment encouraging public nudity in exchange for a flash from women.  The hosts then launched into a furious discussion about the perceived slow governmental response to 9/11,  fueling the conversation with offensive language and numerous angry phone calls from listeners echoing their outrage. One caller, Peter, made a disturbingly insensitive comment about his presumed-dead father.  The debate extended to the new Manhattan driving restrictions, sparking further heated exchanges, notably with a caller named Paul.  Jim Norton was a guest in the studio during this portion.  The segment concluded with a listener-submitted O.J. Simpson prank call montage provided by Chris from KXOA, featuring Simpson making bizarre and threatening 911 calls requesting items like "Prince Albert in a can" and "10-pound balls."

The O.J. Simpson prank call tape dominated a significant portion of the following segment, repeatedly replayed and discussed by the hosts and callers.  A caller, "Tyrone" (later revealed to be a white man), initially defended O.J. before shockingly suggesting he should "cut some more white women's throats."  Opie recounted his tedious experience attending *Phantom of the Opera*, highlighting his boredom and inappropriate behavior, leading to self-deprecating humor and frank discussion about his relationship. The post-9/11 driving restrictions in Manhattan were revisited, with Opie showcasing his self-centered response.  A caller claimed his father died in the World Trade Center attacks and received an insurance payout, a detail the hosts questioned.  Guests included Lewis Black, who commented on the evolving public discourse surrounding 9/11, and the band Bad Ronald.  The website technicalvirgin.com was promoted, and further discussion and promotion of the O.J. Simpson prank call tape concluded this segment.

A lengthy in-studio visit from Bad Ronald followed. The band, described as being high on marijuana, engaged in banter with the hosts, performing songs like "Let's Begin," and engaging in crude, sexually suggestive freestyle rap. They discussed their album release coinciding with 9/11 and its negative impact.  The hosts also addressed listener mail, including bizarre items received.  John from technicalvirgin.com joined, explaining the website's satirical origins and its success in deceiving many participants.  Jim Norton remained in the studio throughout. The O.J. Simpson prank call montage was played again. A surprise involving the "Penis Puppeteers" and a bizarre puppet show left Bad Ronald visibly uncomfortable.  The segment included discussions of a damaged foosball table, the incompetent producer Al Dukes, and a listener in Boston distributing "Wow" stickers promoting the show.

The final segment centered on the broken foosball table, with Al Dukes receiving blame for its destruction.  Opie threatened to fire Dukes if the situation wasn't rectified within a week.  Numerous offensive jokes and comments, including racial slurs and vulgar sexual references, were made by the hosts and callers. Melissa reported positive fan reactions at a Weezer concert. A caller game showcased listeners sharing crude and humorous anecdotes. Further discussion covered Mayor Giuliani's traffic rules, Jim Norton's Penthouse appearance, and upcoming guests Mario Cantone and Jeffrey Ross.  The show concluded with a humorous Ted Knight impersonation skit.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  хорошо, у них есть эти большие тыцки  whether, whether, whether, whether, whether, whether, whether, whether, whether, whether, whether  Wednesday  hvad ye  here is Osama bin Laden  their towelheads gone  may the U.S. blast his ass  the chicken power  He's a bagless wonder that lives in a cave, making marines f***ing Budweiser on that 
[00:00:30]  f*** suckers drag.  Osama, being a chicken f***ing f***ing f***ing, lives off camel turds with a topping of maggots.  Osama thinks we don't have the guts to come and blow off his Islamic nuts, but now America  is done with his crap, so let's just move the f***ers off the map. 
[00:01:00]  So here's Osama, that son of a b***h, made his f***ing f***ing fall off with his seven-year  hips, and made a feet on his f***ing with a big brass hammer, till his a**hole whistles  the star spangled back. 
[00:01:30]  USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA,  Whip-em-out! Whip-em-out! Whip-em-out! Whip-em-out! Whip-em-out! Whip-em-out!  It's your problem! Let's take it off now!  Oh, ah! Oh, ah! Oh, ah! Oh, ah! 
[00:02:00]  Welcome to the OP and Anthony show. Yeah, Whip-em-out Wednesday is back, ladies and gentlemen.  We need some relief on the highways and the byways.  I can't even...  We haven't done it in about a month because we're on vacation and then disaster hit all of us. 
[00:02:30]  So we're going to bring it back today.  It's a very simple concept for the new cities.  We encourage you to put WOW somewhere on your ride.  And if the ladies feel like it, they will flash you on the way home from work today or wherever you're riding to or from.  Okay?  Right.  We do have WOW bumper stickers.  Some of the stations we broadcast on, they have their own personalized WOW bumper stickers.  Yeah.  If your city or station does not have that, well, you send us a self-addressed stamped envelope and we'll give you one of ours. 
[00:03:00]  Okay?  That address is 888 7th Avenue, New York, New York, 10106.  We'll have that address hopefully on opianthony.com as we get our websites back together.  Okay?  Yes.  All right.  So Whip Him Out Wednesday is back.  I've had it.  And Anthony is completely furious.  I'm done.  I'm done on so many levels.  He's going to waste my time about something that doesn't affect me directly. 
[00:03:30]  No, it's not that.  I'm not even going to talk about that yet.  Oh, what do you mean?  I'm just generally disgusted with everything.  That's just part of it.  The whole Manhattan driving situation.  Now, you might remember a couple of short weeks ago, we talked about the patience that everyone has gotten.  Remember that?  I remember you personally saying that to feel safer, you would understand waiting and you would understand that you would have to let your patience go. 
[00:04:00]  I wish I had said like the airport because that's something, you know, you expect the delays and you live with them and whatnot.  And I'm going insane.  I'm going insane.  First of all, waiting for Bush.  Waiting for Bush.  Waiting for Bush and the rest of our government to do anything, right?  To do anything. 
[00:04:30]  Who likes waiting for Bush?  I don't want to wait.  There's nothing being done every day.  I don't know if everyone else is noticing this, but I have every day.  I read the news.  I watch the news.  I go on all the news websites.  I am very up to date on what's going on.  Every day they dilute the American public's anger a little more.  You know what I mean? 
[00:05:00]  Day one, we were shocked and then we went into sad and pissed and everything else.  Remember how pissed off everyone was a couple of weeks ago?  Genuinely fuming.  We got to do something.  My God, this can't happen again.  We got to bomb something.  To help you out.  Completely livid and just assuming that we would strike back immediately.  Right.  Within, I thought if he waited three days, it was a long time.  It was a long time.  George Bush gets up there with everyone else and uses words like, war has been declared on us. 
[00:05:30]  We are in a state of war.  We will fight this war.  War, war, war being thrown around.  The man right now and the administration is not using the word properly.  Freezing assets is not war.  And now every day that goes by, every day that goes by, it's a little bit of more hope that we'll do something taken away. 
[00:06:00]  Now they're talking about a lot of this.  It's a new type of war.  Not the kind of war where you're going to see the type of invasion and stuff that we saw in World War II.  And the action was, oh, okay, so what does that mean?  A lot of covert stuff?  Well, we can't say, but it's a whole different type of war that doesn't involve bombing and killing people.  Anthony, the enemy hides in the shadows.  Right.  I've heard the speeches a thousand friggin' times.  And we have these cells all over the world.  They can hide. 
[00:06:30]  We will chase them down, flush them out, and again, using the term, bring them to justice.  Justice, no.  No.  Justice is their pieces all over the place.  Not bring them to, just the language.  I can't get an exact quote.  I can't put my finger on it exactly because they're doing a very good job at this.  But mark my words and you listen to me, please.  Every day they're taking a little bit of the anger away and putting stuff off and not, 
[00:07:00]  and the language in these speeches are being tweaked every day to make it seem like they're not really going to do anything that the American people want.  Maybe we are doing stuff.  No, we're not.  I've heard that, too.  Maybe there's a lot of covert stuff going on.  Maybe it's so covert we don't know about it.  Bull.  You know why?  Bull.  Bull.  There are friggin' reporters and everything.  And their side wants everyone to see what we're doing. 
[00:07:30]  If we were doing something secretive, you'd know about it.  Believe me, there's no such thing anymore.  I'm getting pissed.  Fred, what's up?  Yo, Anthony's got to calm down, man.  We all feel the same way.  We want instant retaliation.  Yeah.  But even when the Japs bombed Pearl Harbor, it took four months to set up a retaliation.  Stop it.  December 18th, we were bombing something, you idiot.  No.  December 7th was Pearl Harbor. 
[00:08:00]  The major retaliation.  Stop it.  Four months later.  What was four months later?  The major retaliation.  Oh, stop it.  We actually, like Opie, you used the term bouncing some rocks off of it.  You know, we were bouncing around some rocks.  I'm not allowed to use that term anymore.  People are saying I use it too much.  Oh, who cares?  You know what it is, though?  Hey, dude, we did something.  We did something on the 18th after December 7th.  And we would have got there sooner, but it took that long to get the planes over there.  Right.  It took a long time. 
[00:08:30]  And that was back then.  That's what I mean.  We're talking 60 years ago.  It took a lot longer to fly the planes over there.  Ronnie Reagan waited 15 days to bomb Libya, and that was a long time.  But you knew damn well he was doing it.  He wasn't using words in his speech to wind everyone down.  We're up to 15 days right now.  I think the press is taking a big part in winding us down, too.  They're just getting back to business as usual, and that sucks.  All right.  Thank you.  Let's go to John.  John, what's going on?  You don't agree with Anthony, huh? 
[00:09:00]  John!  Yeah.  Oh, I didn't know you were talking.  Yeah.  Tell them to relax a little bit.  They got every wing of the Navy sitting there waiting.  I know what's there.  Dude, if the case was everyone was quiet, George Bush wasn't running around shaking people's  hands all the time, and everyone was in meetings, I wouldn't care.  It's the language of these speeches I'm hearing after two weeks, they've calmed down.  I'm being patient. 
[00:09:30]  I would wait another week if I thought something was going to happen.  You know what?  They're just sitting there changing the language of the speeches to calm us down.  They are not.  Things are going.  Saudi Arabia right now went against the Taliban and voted against, and it's absolutely against  everything that they stand for, which is huge.  My father's a retired Marine and forced recon.  He was in Vietnam before anybody else.  They're doing things.  There are people.  There are Afghanistan and Taliban that are dead now. 
[00:10:00]  They're not holding back.  There's things going on.  They said that we're not going to know what's going on.  Thank God, thank God, we have Bush, Colin Powell, Nick Cheney, Rumsford, they're all  ex-military guys.  You couldn't ask for a more aggressive...  Start it rolling.  Yes, the waiting is the hardest part.  What?  What?  All right, John, thank you.  All right.  I understand what everyone's saying, but you've got to listen. 
[00:10:30]  You've got to listen to these speeches.  They're not as gung-ho.  Scott, what's going on?  I have two quick questions.  And if you've read all these websites and all the news reports, don't you think that  a direct military action would be unwise?  And my second question was, or question was, you yourself said not too long ago that the  longer we wait means, not if we wait forever, but the longer we take means that we're more  deliberate than our plan. 
[00:11:00]  Scott, hold on a second.  Hold on a second.  The waiting is the hardest part.  Very hard.  The waiting is the hardest part.  Uh-huh.  You take it on faith.  You take it to the heart.  The waiting is the hardest part.  All right, Scott.  What would be your second question?  Well, no reason.  What?  There's no reaction?  The waiting the hardest part.  The hardest for what?  Listen to me, Scott.  Your first question, what was that about bombing other countries?  If you've read all the websites, don't you realize that if we had to take direct military 
[00:11:30]  and immediate action, that would be unwise.  Why?  The grand scope of things.  Why?  The fact that, because, okay, as it has been just drilled into our heads, not drilled into  our heads, meaning we're mindless, but it has to be explained that we do have the support  of the European Union.  So what?  A lot of other nations in the Middle East for taking anti-terrorist action.  What's the downside?  If we are too direct militarily, we would lose that support. 
[00:12:00]  Screw the support.  I'm tired of dancing around all of these different groups.  We changed the God-effing name of this mission because we were offending someone.  Eat me!  Offensive is 7,000 dead people and buildings destroyed.  That's offensive.  They get offended by infinite justice?  No, because they say, because the Muslims say that only God can dole out infinite justice.  Only Muhammad.  Eat me!  Eat me!  You know, but as it has been explained that this will be a long, drawn-out operation, 
[00:12:30]  don't you think that, you know, support would be wise?  Scott, you've got to listen to me.  Okay.  Right after this happened, we should have bombed the mother F out of Afghanistan.  We should have also taken out Iraq because they're responsible too.  We've sat there and done nothing.  And you know what's going to happen?  God, mark my friggin' words, what's going to happen?  They will strike before we do. 
[00:13:00]  Another terrorist strike before we do crap because we're doing nothing and they're laughing at us.  I think we look like a bunch of pussies.  Absolutely, Opie.  Thank you.  We look like pussies.  We're doing nothing.  And the language in these speeches are doing nothing but trying to calm us down and set us up for the big disappointment that nothing is going to happen.  Look at what happened when we played defense for eight years.  We played, oh, we won't go after these groups.  We'll sit back because if we don't F with them, they won't F with us.  Look, we're 7,000 people and a few buildings in the hole now. 
[00:13:30]  And it's time to do something.  But it's not like you couldn't have expected that they would have retaliated against us in that way.  But I will say that you are entitled to your opinion and only time will tell.  Well, I guess we'll agree to disagree.  There you go.  Bye.  God, I can't handle this.  You know, I might not agree with what you say, but I'll defend with my life your right to say,  Shut up!  Shut up!  Although I would make a couple of quick points.  The only reason I think we need other countries is for certain intelligence aspects. 
[00:14:00]  Right, okay.  Things that they have.  But you know something?  Our allies will stick by us in that aspect.  We're not getting intelligence from the people that are on the fence,  for the people that we're running to, like the Saudis,  that won't let us use some of their friggin' air bases.  That's a fake ally right there.  That's a fake ally.  And one thing, I want to see military action, really,  or I want to see military action that actually embarrasses us in ten years,  that we look back and go, Oh, that was too rough.  That was a little rough.  Exactly! 
[00:14:30]  Maybe we went a little too far.  One thing I'll say, though, is sometimes when you're dealing with cockroaches,  I mean, they scurry into little holes, and hindsight will prove this.  If they're just cutting off some of the holes,  just to leave these little dirty roaches running in the middle of the kitchen  so you can step on them, then this makes sense.  But I don't know if they're going to do that.  But that could be what they're doing,  is closing off some of the little holes financially.  The countries that support them, we are not stupid.  We know what these countries are.  We know the countries and the governments of these countries that support these people. 
[00:15:00]  Why are we not screwing them up so badly  that any country would be insane to take these terrorists in?  You make them second-guess themselves.  Right.  But now are they second-guessing?  They're going, Oh, my God, look what we got away with.  It's like, Holy S.  But, ooh, they froze bank accounts.  Ooh!  They're laughing.  A lot of them are religious lunatics, though,  and martyrdom to them is like being a rock star to us.  Well, great.  You know something?  And we will sponsor their sending them to friggin' Allah. 
[00:15:30]  We'll help them.  We'll do them the favor.  They want to be martyrs?  Who are we to deny them?  Let's kill them and send them to a better place.  We'll be doing them a favor.  We only have five minutes before.  We need to be funny, right?  Five minutes left.  Peter, what's going on?  Yo, what's up?  Hey.  My father was in the World Trade Center,  and he was on the 103rd floor.  And this, and...  Sorry to hear that, man.  Yeah.  I just want to kill these bastards, I swear to you. 
[00:16:00]  I want to take AIDS and spray AIDS all over them.  Nice.  Do we have the AIDS bomb yet?  Have we built a great delivery system for the AIDS?  We should.  We really should.  I really want to kill these effing bastards.  Yeah.  They make me so pissed off.  Your dad died, or is he still listening to his message?  They say he's presumed dead.  Oh, okay.  Oh.  But the best thing is we're getting $100,000 out of this.  You are either goofing or the sickest little son of a bitch I've ever heard. 
[00:16:30]  You have to be goofing, Peter.  He's taking lemons and he's making lemons.  We are getting $100,000 out of this, though.  There's no joking about this.  Are you serious?  Now, don't be an idiot.  Did your father die?  They said he's presumed dead.  Panther Fitzgerald.  You heard of those people?  Peter.  Yes.  You need to be on the radio this bad that you had to come up with this today?  My father.  His name is Paul DeCola, okay?  Are all your friends sitting in another room laughing that you got through to the stadium? 
[00:17:00]  No, you effing tool.  No.  No.  It might be, and this is how he's dealing with it, which, you know, because I have no clue  how a kid would deal with something like this.  But now I know you're lying.  You're not 18.  I have a disability.  Peter.  All right.  I've had enough.  Wait, wait.  What is a disability besides sounding like Peter Lorre?  Ask you, Norton.  All right.  What is with...  God damn.  Everyone's lost their minds.  Everyone.  Don't... 
[00:17:30]  Everyone's lost their minds.  Hey, Ed, how was your drive-in today?  Oh, my God.  Another thing.  See?  See?  Well, I think the whole country could grasp on what I was just saying, whether you agree  or not.  But now for a little bit more of a local thing, the Manhattan traffic, we knew it was going  to be all screwed up.  You know, lower Manhattan is a mess. 
[00:18:00]  Can't get in.  I'm coming in from Brooklyn.  Traffic every day.  It's getting worse every day.  I understand that.  Fine.  I sit in the traffic.  I bitch about it.  There's nothing you can do about it.  Giuliani, I guess, Mayor Giuliani, praised...  We've praised him here, and he did a great job as mayor during this crisis.  I think he was feeling a little too well-liked.  Just when he got so many new friends.  I think his popularity was too high for even him to like.  He couldn't handle it, so he goes, well, this will get him. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah.  You know, every story's like that, too.  The Grinch, you know, the Grinch was a real prick.  And then at the end, he came to, you know.  And there's always those stories of the real son of a bitch that all of a sudden everyone  likes.  Well, he just couldn't do it for too long.  Well, he's deciding, starting tomorrow, that there are to be no cars. 
[00:19:00]  Cross-town traffic.  Very good.  Can we turn it down at hinge?  He's decided that there are no cars in Manhattan below 67th Street.  It pretty much cuts Manhattan in three quarters of Manhattan, the important part of Manhattan,  off-limits to cars with one person in them.  You need two people or more in every vehicle.  Which is more to get revenue for the city because you're forced to use mass transit. 
[00:19:30]  Right, which is just going to be a catastrophe.  It's bad enough as it is.  Now, I don't know how the hell I'm getting in tomorrow, to tell you the truth.  The subway from Brooklyn is a mess.  I believe it involves shuttle buses for me.  I believe I can not only just jump on a stop.  I believe I would need a shuttle bus.  A shuttle bus?  A shuttle bus.  To get you to your subway stop.  To get me to the subway, then to get me here, and then get...  Is that a short bus? 
[00:20:00]  Yeah, the shuttle bus.  I don't know what to do.  And can't even handle a minor delay.  I don't like...  You know something?  I understand the gravity of this situation.  We've seen it.  The destruction.  The death.  Now we are entering the phase of major inconvenience for the rest of the living.  You know that if we are to stay alive...  What is this, Rick?  Bang it. 
[00:20:30]  I'm just playing a song for you.  Relax.  Thank you.  Is this my relax song?  Yeah.  Mellowing you out.  And Giuliani...  I called one of our cop friends, and he doesn't even know how this is going to work.  Giuliani blurted this out, and it's taking effect tomorrow.  So, you're not going to be able to do this from 6 a.m. till midnight.  You cannot have a car in Manhattan with one person in it.  Now, a lot of people said, I'm going to beat the rush. 
[00:21:00]  I'm going to take my single occupancy vehicle in before 6 a.m.  Now, you get out at 5.  There you are, in Manhattan with one person in the car.  What are they going to do?  Shoot you?  Throw you out?  Push you into the river?  They didn't think this out.  But it's being enacted in a matter of hours.  I'm on the way for all our lives to be over.  Right.  Now, we're going to have to cue some of these songs up.  We're going way too long for the joke.  Rick gets these ideas, hands you the CD. 
[00:21:30]  It's a 20-minute intro.  What the hell did he do the other day?  What was that?  Jimi Hendrix, Star Spangled Banner.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And the intro to that before it is even recognizable as the Star Spangled Banner.  Well, it's four minutes long.  Four minutes.  Anyway.  Ben, why'd you pull a stupid Rick thing like that?  You want to blame Ben, Rick?  It's just a mess down here in New York. 
[00:22:00]  My patience is growing very, very thin.  I can't take this anymore.  Man, people hate you today.  Paul, what's going on?  Anthony, you're a girl.  Shut up.  Get on the subway like the rest of us.  I used to work in your building.  Hey, shuttle bus, ass.  Shuttle bus.  Listen to me.  I used to work in your building.  There's four subway lines within two blocks of your building.  Suck it up.  Read a magazine.  Yeah, where do they go?  Go to work.  Where do they go?  Okay, the end train's on your corner, douche.  No.  I know where it is.  It's on 7th Avenue. 
[00:22:30]  You've got the 8th Avenue trains and the 6th Avenue trains.  She's totally ridiculous.  Hey, schmuck douche.  Uh, uh, uh, uh, shuttle bus.  I'll have to take a shuttle bus.  You take the subway from Brooklyn.  The R-line from Brooklyn's dead, you stupid F.  If you need me to translate it for you, I will, dumbass.  And take a train into the city like the rest of us.  Paul, Paul, Ant doesn't like going underground.  Well, Ant needs to grow up a little bit.  That's where they're going to be spreading the anthrax in the subways.  Right.  You think I'm going to be stuck there with the likes of you? 
[00:23:00]  Breathing in disease?  Anthony, you know.  And let me tell you something.  After tomorrow, Paul, after tomorrow, you're going to be crying.  Sweaty armpit in your face.  That thing is going to be loaded like a sardine can after tomorrow.  You tell me how nice it is.  This is what's important to you.  With everything that's going on, last couple of weeks, because little girl Anthony can't get his car in the city.  Right.  Oh, I'm leaving the room.  That's what it is.  Little girl Anthony can't get his car in the city.  Suck it up.  Suck it up.  Be a man about it.  Just suck it up and take a train for an hour.  How about you suck it?  Yeah. 
[00:23:30]  How about you suck it, Paul?  Grow up, Anthony.  Yeah, grow up.  There we go.  Oh, I've been hung up on.  Eat my F, you S-headed mother F-tool.  Well, I hope you know that saying grow up and hang up on somebody should make you think.  You know, I'm even going to sit back and say he's got a point, because I'm very pissed,  and a lot of people aren't going to be able to appreciate the pissed-offedness that I have in me.  The guy was calling and saying, all right, I'm whining.  Fine.  I'm whining.  I could get on the subway.  I could do that.  What I'm saying is...  I think it's a bunch of things that are finally getting to you, and you've reached your limit. 
[00:24:00]  Right.  I think if you just had to deal with a crappy commute, you'd be kind of okay.  If we were bombing something.  Right, but it's all these things, you know, coming together, and you're losing your effing mind like everyone else.  Because now the devastation of this whole thing is spreading out.  The ripple effect, it's getting smaller, but it's spreading out a lot wider.  And it's affecting a lot of people in other ways.  Not just restaurants are closing down, Broadway shows.  And what are we doing about it? 
[00:24:30]  Nothing.  People getting fired left and right in New York City because, you know, let's just talk about the hotels.  The hotels don't need as many people working.  We can't live our lives like we did beforehand.  It's directly because of these scum terrorists.  And we're doing nothing.  That's what pisses me off.  If I knew I was being inconvenienced with the rest of this city, but we were doing something about it, it would be a lot easier to take.  There's no retaliation. 
[00:25:00]  No wonder people have beaten up the frigging Muslims.  They're taking it into their own hands.  Don't do that, people.  Yeah, no, that's not good.  Mike, what's up?  Hey, I got a suggestion for you.  Yeah.  Take that blow-up doll that you hopped at night and put it in your passenger seat.  You were saying take my blow-up doll, my blow-up sex toy doll, and put it in the passenger seat so I have three people?  Drop it in the passenger seat and drive.  They'll never know.  There you go.  Okay.  I'll try that.  The funny thing is this is all moot because Ant's just going to start driving his police cruiser to work again. 
[00:25:30]  Mike, I would take your mom with me, but I'd still get pulled over because with her head in my lap, the cops would still think there's only one person in there.  Dick, Dick.  Brother Joe wants in.  Brother Joe.  I am thoroughly pissed.  I'm as pissed as Anthony is.  They're doing nothing.  It's all the same old story.  And you know what?  Remember when you were in high school and there was that little scrappy kid that could beat up anybody?  Just a little scrappy kid.  He wasn't particularly big. 
[00:26:00]  He didn't have a lot of friends, but he was able to beat people up.  That was all he was good at.  He could beat people up.  Right.  When you got punched in the nose by that kid, did you worry about getting all your friends together to get this kid back?  No.  You picked up a baseball bat and you broke both his effing legs.  Right.  That's what you do.  And I'm as pissed as you are, man.  There's too much politics involved with our retaliation of this.  Way too much.  Yeah.  It's, you know, I mean, it's PC United States as usual.  If we got to sit back, if we got to sit back and look at these countries and go, oh, we can't, we got to worry because they'll get mad if we bomb them. 
[00:26:30]  Whoever gets pissed off at our actions, roll tape.  Roll the video of two weeks ago.  Oh, yeah.  And tell them, how are we not justified in doing exactly whatever we did right up to the A-bomb?  In doing absolutely anything.  How are we not justified?  And how could you as a country be pissed at us for retaliating when, look at this, see the person falling out the window?  Look at that.  See the people jumping out of the flaming friggin' window? 
[00:27:00]  There you go.  Now, how are we not justified?  The trade center being the biggest symbol of capitalism?  Yeah.  I say we should have taken out the biggest symbol of Islam.  We should have just bombed a couple, taken out a couple of mosques over in Afghanistan.  There you go, right over there.  They're most holy of mosques.  That's it.  And that, you know, and you know what?  It probably wouldn't have stopped them, but it would have made them think.  Yep.  You know?  And right now, it's not even making them think.  You're right.  I do believe, I honestly do believe. 
[00:27:30]  By the way, stay out of the subways, man.  Don't take the subway.  That's where the anthrax is going.  That's right.  But something, I'm telling you, man, it's not hard.  It's not hard to do.  Yeah.  All right, brother John.  It's not hard to do.  Anybody can do it.  Let's not get more paranoid than we are.  Thank you.  We're all paranoid.  I'm telling you, man, it's not even paranoid.  No, I'm just saying let's not get people more paranoid.  We all know what could happen.  I don't feel like talking about it.  You know what it is?  Let me tell you something, O. 
[00:28:00]  All the stuff you're hearing that comes off as paranoia, any time before September 11th,  if you would have said, how about a terrorist taking our own passenger planes and crashing  into huge buildings and all the fuel, wow, would that have been paranoia?  Sure, it would have been.  It ended up a reality, and I think we all have to be prepared for the worst here.  It's paranoia, and the reality is with it as well.  Right.  Every day I'm on the Long Island Railroad, and you have to go under the East River there,  and you're like, oh, my God, am I going to make it to the other side? 
[00:28:30]  Oh, boy.  I like my single-person vehicle with my gas mask right there next to me.  You really have it?  I could see you.  Who doesn't have a gas mask now?  I don't.  You've got to get a gas mask.  Do you have a gas mask, Opie?  Not yet.  Ben, I'm pricing them.  Gas mask?  I'm pricing them.  Gas mask?  No one has a gas mask?  I didn't like it.  I'm taking an impromptu survey.  Ben, how do you know they're sold out?  You try to get one.  I bought a metal detector today. 
[00:29:00]  Did you get a metal detector?  Yeah.  What the hell is that going to do?  I bought us a metal detector today.  You're going to look for a little change on the beach?  Oh, I got you.  Like one of the personal ones that they use at the airport.  Wee, wee.  You think I'm scared?  So we can scan people that come in.  If you run into a terrorist, you can hit them over the head with it.  There you go.  All right, brother Joe.  All right, guys.  Hey, man.  It's a nightmare down here.  I don't know if people fully understand in other cities.  Every day you're just freaking out.  Like last night, I had to go through the tunnels on the way home.  You're like, am I going to make it to the other side? 
[00:29:30]  Yeah.  Boy, when that water rushes in, woof.  You got the NYPD.  You got the FBI and all sorts of agencies on both sides of the tunnel, you know, checking  everything.  And I'm glad they're doing that.  And unfortunately, that means very long delays for people.  Yeah.  But that just makes you even more paranoid because you're like, wow, look how many cops are  checking vehicles now.  It really is like a police state.  It's like martial law.  We are just above martial law right now. 
[00:30:00]  You go around and all the military, the police with weapons that you never see cops toting  around.  It's just become something like that you never could have imagined seeing.  We have a cop on every corner.  You would think, oh, that's a good thing to have.  No, it's not.  Yeah.  And then the big sanitation trucks full of sand blocking the on-ramps to prohibited roadways.  So you're going down the FDR or you get off the Brooklyn Bridge and you can't go into downtown. 
[00:30:30]  There's the huge sanitation trucks that they use to sand the roads and plow them in the  winter loaded with sand, too.  So they have the weight with the plows down and they're across all these on-ramps.  So you can't go there.  And you look around going, well, we're in a military state.  You know, it's amazing.  Hey, Nicole.  Hey.  You fine African sister, you.  Thank you.  Oh, Nicole.  I just want to tell you.  Are you a cafe latte?  No, honey.  I'm a vanilla fantasy. 
[00:31:00]  Thank you.  What is a vanilla fantasy?  A little lighter?  Yes.  Yeah.  I just want to comment real quick.  I totally feel what both of you guys are saying.  But see, my vision of the bombing would have been when the fat lady was dancing in the street  that they kept repeating over and over again.  Right then, if we had a bomb, then that would have been the thing to replay.  See, wouldn't that have been nice to say she's celebrating, doing her thing with her rotting  teeth in her head, and all of a sudden you just see an explosion and see her head go flying. 
[00:31:30]  I need that.  Nicole.  I need that.  Nicole, you're in the hood, right?  No, honey.  I work in suburbia.  I thought all black people lived in the hood.  Hey, watch that.  Hey.  I'm just kidding.  Watch that.  Just trying to get the humor back in the show, Nicole.  No.  I'm sorry.  I'm going to tell you.  I'm down with the struggle.  We were going to, like, you know, refer to, like, gangs, you know?  No.  One gang gets hit.  What do they do?  The other gang doesn't just sit around and figure out what they're doing. 
[00:32:00]  They hit back immediately, right?  Okay.  Better yet.  Better yet.  So you're suggesting a big drive-by?  No.  Better yet.  That would be better than freezing assets, my friend.  Hey.  I'm sorry, Nicole.  All of the prisoners that are on death row doing one or two life sentences, I say we  send them all over there on a big boat, okay?  They're professional killers.  This is what they train to do.  And we let them.  We tell them you have eight days, okay?  And we have Mike Tyson lead the charge.  You go in there.  You kill everybody. 
[00:32:30]  And then what you do is, if you make it back to shore, we'll take you back to America,  okay?  We'll give you $500, and we'll let you go.  $500?  Hey, what better?  How about $5 million?  Look, $500 is a lot more than what they're getting right now.  I say we send Mike Tyson over there.  Not only will he find Bin Laden, he'll bite him in the testicles, take him off the Zoloft,  and send him over there.  You're nuts.  You guys are so nuts.  But I love you.  All right.  The office listens to you, man.  Thank you, Nicole.  Look at that. 
[00:33:00]  You know what?  Christy on line three has a great point.  This is some of the stuff I've been saying.  Christy.  How you doing, guys?  What's up?  Just bear with me.  I'm a little nervous.  That's okay.  I was working in the Trade Center in 1993, and every day I feel very lucky that I'm  actually here still.  Did you still work in the Trade Center two weeks ago?  No.  I wasn't there then.  Thank goodness.  Okay.  But I'm a little aggravated because when it happened in 1993, and they found all those 
[00:33:30]  guys, including the idiot that actually went back to get his deposit for his rent-a-van.  Yeah.  Remember that guy?  These guys are in prison now doing 256 years.  Yeah.  They're living better than the homeless people in this city.  They're in prison.  First of all, yeah.  And they're living much better than the scum, dirty-ass people in their countries that  they come from.  Including the pregnant woman that was in the building who, you know, obviously died and  sent her baby.  If you look at the way these people live in their filth-ridden countries, American prisons 
[00:34:00]  are like a hotel.  It's better.  Upgrade.  It's like going to the St. Regis Club Med.  It's like going to a luxury hotel for these mother effers.  So the reason why I call is because, you know, I'm flipping through the TV, you know, because  you, you know, they have, you know, everybody else's perspective on this.  And there was, I can't remember which channel I was watching, but they were saying that,  you know, if the possibility of bringing, you know, Bin Laden to justice and what kind  of justice are they talking about?  Are they going to do the same thing that they did with these other guys back in 93? 
[00:34:30]  They're going to put them in jail?  What does that mean?  Nothing.  Look how good, look how good that worked, bringing them to justice.  We ran the 93 people through the system.  They are now in prison.  With our tax dollars.  200 and some odd years.  Who gives a flying F that they're spending a couple of hundred years in prison?  Yeah, with our tax dollars.  With our tax dollars.  We're paying for their food right now.  And it didn't deter their brothers.  It didn't do anything.  These people understand blood and guts and death.  That's what they understand.  That's what they dole out.  That's what we have to dole out. 
[00:35:00]  Ten times worse to them.  But the other thing I don't understand is, if they're not from this country, then how  come they are able to have the same kind of, you know, privilege that we're all given  in a sense of being able to be brought to trial?  Because we're America.  That's it.  Because we believe in justice.  We're too nice.  We're too nice.  Thank you.  We've got to take a break, Christy.  But thank you.  Good point.  Oh, Chachi's calling from Boston.  WBCN.  Remember we had the problem with the bus signs yesterday?  Yes, we did.  We had, what, the WOW bus signs all over Boston. 
[00:35:30]  It said Opie and Anthony, WBCN.  Wow.  Two people complained and the MBTA up there got rid of all the bus signs.  All the bus signs.  Hey, boys.  Chachi.  Hey, Chachi.  What's going on with the bus signs?  Well, a couple of things.  We picked up a small supply of them this afternoon, about 170 of them.  We're going to give them away this afternoon.  During the 5 o'clock hour, we'll send Cali down Route 9 West, and we'll send another van  down Route 1, you know, towards Kowloon's. 
[00:36:00]  And we'll give them out to all your fans.  It's pretty cool.  I got a lot of email from people saying, hey, man, I want one of those things.  So here's your chance to get the bus signs that were banned from Boston.  It's unbelievable.  I've got to interrupt your subject matter, a life or death subject matter, to talk about  WOW signs coming off a bus.  That's important, too.  And, you know, did anyone notice that there's TNA and MBTA?  I think that's disgraceful.  That's offensive.  They should change their initials.  Exactly.  So we're going to give them away at 5 o'clock.  We'll have the boys call in. 
[00:36:30]  I spoke to Dean Johnson a little while ago, too.  Ah, the guy that made up his own story.  Oh, nice.  That's what reporters should be doing, making up their own stories.  He built a story.  He built his own story.  See, I spoke to him because no one else speaks to him here at BCA.  Yeah.  And what do you have to say?  He said that one guy called him and left a message, and based on that one call, he called  the MBTA, and the MBTA pulled the signs down.  He is such a sack.  Smells like Dave Dickless, our old boss. 
[00:37:00]  That's the games he used to play behind the scenes.  That's it.  It's amazing they're wasting their time with this.  Hey, we can't prove it, but I wouldn't be surprised.  Let's just put it that way.  But we have over 900 of these signs we're going to give out in the next few weeks.  We have the first shipment of them today, this afternoon.  Cool.  All right, Chachi.  Thank you.  Hey, guys.  They'll call in later when they're somewhere in Boston with those signs.  Okay.  Why doesn't Dean go out?  You know what Dean should do?  He should go out and mug people for money, and then the next day write, newspaper journalist  mugs people. 
[00:37:30]  Why not?  Just make up your own stories.  What the hell?  Anthony, really fast.  On the show today, of course, Jim Norton in the studio again.  He's in the latest Penthouse issue, a one-page Q&A that is hilarious.  Pick that up.  Yeah.  It's out today, I believe, on newsstands everywhere.  Louis Black coming in at four.  He was fired up yesterday, so we invited him back in today.  The band Bad Ronald.  They're going to rock.  You got it right?  Huh?  Of course I got it right.  Also, we got an OJ prank call tape that is unbelievable. 
[00:38:00]  We'll try to get to that next.  Also, we got John from technicalvirgins.com.  We were talking about that website yesterday.  And lots, lots, lots, lots more to do today.  Oh, and real fast, how's the new foosball table?  Okay.  Don't even.  I totally forgot about that.  What?  I thought you'd be happy.  That's stupid Al Dix.  What happened to the old one?  All right, we'll talk about the...  Oh, it's not out there.  We can't even have fun playing foosball today.  All right, we'll talk about that next as well. 
[00:38:30]  There's a car with a wow next to me.  Whip out your cans.  Pull out your fun bags.  What are you waiting for?  Do it.  Do it now.  I'm wowing.  You look fabulous.  O.B. and Anthony.  We love seeing boobs.  Well, duh.  Anthony, New York Islanders hockey is back.  Oh, yeah.  Are you newcomers, Alexi Yashin and Mike Pekka,  along with the rest of your Islanders,  are anxious to kick off the 30th anniversary season of New York Islanders hockey.  I couldn't be more psyched than I am right now, Ant. 
[00:39:00]  Season tickets for the New York Islanders 30th anniversary season are still available  and for the same affordable price as last season.  The New York Islanders have one of the lowest season ticket prices in the New York area  with seats starting as low as $14.  They also offer the best season ticket benefits in the NHL,  such as free parking for the entire season,  40% savings off the box office price,  an exclusive meet and greet with the team, which is very cool.  They were doing that last year.  And almost 20 games of promotional giveaways.  If you can't handle a full season of the fast-paced action, 
[00:39:30]  then check out the Islanders mini packs.  I bought one of these, Anthony.  Yeah.  Whether it's for 21, 14, or 7 games,  you'll get the same great seats to this season's best games,  all at an affordable price.  Give them a call right now for New York Islanders hockey.  1-800-882-ILES.  1-800-882-ILES.  O.P. and Anthony.  1027 WNEW.  And we're back with the O&A show. 
[00:40:00]  I have Kid Chris on the line, Anthony.  Oh, yeah?  He's from KXOA.  Right.  KXOA.  KXOA.  Yeah, they want you to emphasize the X.  One of the stations we're on in Sacramento, California,  and he emailed me this O.J. prank call tape.  It's hilarious.  Let's get him on the line.  Kid Chris.  Hey, Kid. 
[00:40:30]  What's up?  O to the is-a?  Do you like being called Kid or Kid Chris?  No, it doesn't matter.  You can just call me Chris, Kid, whatever.  He's also friends with our buddy Scorch, Anthony.  Daddy Scorch, King of the Negative.  Tony's Newt Radio.  Hey, dudes are dressing.  You know, I worked with Scorch for a long-ass time up in Syracuse.  Yeah?  Yeah, I got a funny story about Scorch.  Actually, he was like the PD for a while, you know?  Yeah.  And we were on, I was on in the morning at the time.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, slow down. 
[00:41:00]  He was the PD up there in Syracuse for a while?  For a little while, yeah.  BPD on a BD.  Imagine him, he used to, you know, he'd sit down at the jocks and tell them what to do and what not to do.  Oh, wow.  You're making Ben lose his mind.  Ben loves Scorch.  Ben loves Scorch stories.  Oh, no, here's a funny Scorch story.  I was working in the morning at the time, and we were on the radio talking about how he's the boss and all that stuff,  and how he's giving us a hard time.  And he had the windows on his Jeep slash because of that. 
[00:41:30]  Really?  Yeah, somebody whacked his Jeep.  Nice.  So, Kid, you're on after us in Sacramento?  Yeah, it's 7 o'clock.  Right on.  What's the buzz out there in Sacramento?  Ah, man, you know, I'll tell you, the station is huge, I mean, I think.  I mean, it's the hottest one in town because this is the way radio right now, you know?  Yeah.  You know, and when all this stuff's going down, like last week with the terrorist attacks and stuff,  you know, this station's the only one being real, you know?  Everybody else is playing their music and they're top eight at eight and all that crap, and nobody, you know. 
[00:42:00]  Getting the lead out.  Yeah.  Mandatory Metallica.  Yeah, just the, you know, the phoniness, pretending like nothing's happening, you know?  Yeah, we had a bunch of stations in New York do exactly that and worked not even two miles from the disaster area.  Yeah, it's sickening.  So, you emailed me about an O.J. prank call tape.  Yeah, I did this a while ago.  We got, you know, it pays when you're in radio.  It pays when you got people that have regular jobs, you know, the real jobs.  Yeah.  Listen, because, like, a guy that worked for one of the cell phone companies looked up O.J.'s cell phone number in his database or whatever and got me the number. 
[00:42:30]  Oh, dude.  Years ago, Matt.  You're bringing back a memory.  Aunt and I, the exact same thing happened to us when we were up in Boston.  We can't name who it was.  We had one of the Boston Celtics' cell phone numbers.  No, what was it?  Pager.  His messaging service.  His messaging service.  And we got the codes. 
[00:43:00]  We got to check out everyone calling this superstar.  You listened to his messages?  Dude, it was the only way, the only thing we did to prepare for our show in Boston.  We'll admit it now.  We would spend, what, Anthony, a half hour every day going through all the messages.  Real estate agents trying to find a house for this guy.  Hey, baby, I hear you going to be in.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  I'm heading to that.  So you had the real estate agencies trying to find a house.  You had the car dealers going. 
[00:43:30]  One car dealer was pissed off because the guy did not return the car.  It was like three months overdue.  Right.  Man.  Then you had a gaming company saying, hey, we're working on a blah, blah game with, you know.  His coach called him.  With PlayStation.  We got the, yeah, the coaches calling him.  Did girls leave their numbers on it?  That's, that's the.  90% of it was chicks.  Chicks from all over America.  All over the country.  Just booties in every city.  Yeah.  And they, and they all thought they were the one.  It was hilarious.  Did you call the girls? 
[00:44:00]  I hear you going to be in Los Angeles this week.  Why don't you give me a call?  Yeah, you had girls calling from every city.  Did you call the girls at all?  No.  We didn't make any calls.  No, no.  Because we didn't want to mess it up.  We had this number for months.  And we just figured if we.  Who was it?  If we, if we effed with it too much, we would, you know, we would screw ourselves.  Who was it?  We can't say.  Why not?  He's still up there, man.  So?  It's not like we did anything with it.  What's the matter of?  What was that? 
[00:44:30]  It was, it was Walker.  What?  I didn't say nothing.  Hey, Twan.  So drunk girls calling from all over America in the middle of like clubs and stuff.  And, and then you get the ones that are really pissed off because they thought they were the  only one.  Oh, man.  It was, it was some of the best stuff and we couldn't put any, any of it on the radio.  I know.  Doesn't that suck?  We would have got screwed.  I know.  But they, oh man, that sucks.  It's kind of like one of those things where you, you think it over. 
[00:45:00]  How can I get away with this?  How can I do this?  I thought you were special.  I thought you were special.  I thought you were a real man.  You're nothing but a little boy.  You're nothing but, you're telling a guy making millions upon millions of dollars that he's  a little boy.  Yeah.  Like he cares.  That's great.  Then he had his homies calling.  It was, oh.  Any dirt?  Did you get any dirt?  Well, just the, just the women that, you know.  Oh, we wanted to hear, you know, something big.  Was he married or anything? 
[00:45:30]  No, no, no.  Man, man, I got your stuff.  You know, something like that.  Right.  Never heard that.  No, we never heard any of that stuff.  But it was great to hear these women, man.  Anyway, so this guy gave you OJ's cell phone number?  Yeah, he came up to me at one of my bar remotes and gave me the number.  And he didn't tell me what it was at first.  So I went home and called it like on a Sunday morning.  And he kept answering the phone.  I'm sitting there.  I kept calling him.  I couldn't recognize the voice.  And he's all like, hello, who is this?  And I'm like, who are you? 
[00:46:00]  And then, like, the next day he called me and told me who it was.  And then we started this thing on the air.  We called every hour for like a week straight.  And we had people guess how long before he would disconnect the number.  Now, that's a good bit, my friend.  That's much better than douche or dressing.  You know what?  And Scorch comes up with some good stuff.  I wish, like, he wouldn't go on the radio.  I wish he'd just email me the ideas.  Douche or dressing.  Douche or dressing.  So you get called OJ.  I mean, just hysterical stuff. 
[00:46:30]  Yeah, the montage there is, like, my favorite.  I have other ones, too.  I'll send you guys, too.  Really?  We are huge OJ fans.  Oh, who isn't?  I mean, any time, Chris, that OJ's in the news, don't you just go, oh, God, I got to read  every word.  Exactly.  Of the article.  I love it.  Because he's so stupid.  And he's such a phony, too, because he tries, he phony laughs everything off.  And you'll hear that in the call.  Oh, yeah.  Phony laughs stuff off.  Yeah.  We love it, though.  We love reading in the paper.  My favorite post-murder article about OJ has to be when he was breaking into his girlfriend's 
[00:47:00]  house to steal the audio tapes on the answering machine.  He left threatening messages.  It's like, hi, you bitch.  I'm going to slit your throat if you...  Uh-oh.  Okay.  Hey, look, I'm going to break into your house, but please don't call the police.  Or the 911 tapes.  Oh, those are classic.  Yeah.  Where he's throwing that other dude under the bus.  He sold out Pedro Guerrero.  No, no.  She went, Pedro Guerrero.  He was caught with a kilo of cocaine. 
[00:47:30]  Do we have...  That's B-E-D.  Do we have a Pedro Guerrero one?  Sold him down the river, man.  He's the guy that killed two people, and he's worried about Pedro Guerrero.  Yeah.  Our OJ prank call tape thing is hilarious.  If we can find the short version, we'll play it today.  And then when OJ called up 911, he was telling her about how the girlfriend took off, and  911 goes, are there any weapons around there?  He goes, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Not this time.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  He is killer, man.  Literally and figuratively. 
[00:48:00]  So Kid Chris from KXOA out there in Sacramento, he gave us the montage.  Yeah.  It's about almost two minutes long, and it's really...  We were laughing so hard, we played it about ten times in the back office.  It's you calling OJ, and it's really funny, man.  All right, let's check this out.  Yeah.  Juice?  Yeah.  Yeah, what are you doing?  Who's this?  This is AC.  Let's go kill somebody tonight.  Hi. 
[00:48:30]  Juice?  Yeah, hello.  OJ.  Who's this?  It's Al Michaels.  My wife's been acting like a real bitch.  I was wondering if you could help me kill her.  What do you say, champ?  Do I know you?  Hey.  Juice, it's Chris Rock.  It's me, Chris Rock, Juice.  What do you say you and I go kill the Spice Girls?  Juice, every time I call you, I always be laughing. 
[00:49:00]  Hello?  Juice, you're late.  We're supposed to go out and kill people tonight.  What's going on?  I really can't talk.  I'm at dinner with a bunch of people, and I have no idea who you are.  I'm the real killer.  OJ.  Hello?  Yeah.  Yeah, Juice.  Yeah?  Juice, what's up?  Who is it?  It's Dan Dierdorf.  You want to go throw the ball around, you know, have some beers, maybe kill somebody? 
[00:49:30]  Yeah?  Hi, OJ.  It's Kato.  Well, I want to go pick up some young girls and kill them.  We can hold them underwater or something.  How'd I go?  Can I move in with you?  Hello?  Hi, OJ.  Hey.  Hey, it's Marcus Allen.  Want to go get some bitches and kill them? 
[00:50:00]  And there you have it.  Kid Chris, that's hilarious.  That is so funny.  Chris, you want to go get some girls and kill them?  Bravo, Chris.  Thanks, bro.  And I know exactly what you're talking about, about that fake OJ laugh.  Yeah.  You got me, guys.  He's laughing.  Oh, I killed two people, and I'm out. 
[00:50:30]  It's your next, cracker boy.  You better not have no caller ID, man.  OJ, come and get you.  Man, you made our day with that.  Yeah, Chris, thank you.  Good.  Thank you, bro.  We're getting requests to put that on our website.  Is that cool?  Yeah.  I mean, those are ancient.  I got those, too, if anybody.  I mean, I got others I'll send you, too.  I've got, like, we would bring girls in the studio, you know, because he loves the women.  Right.  Yeah.  And we would have girls call him and try to hook up with him and stuff.  And then, you know, at the end, he'd be all like, well, I can't right now.  I've got to go do it. 
[00:51:00]  Please, I don't want you to get mad and kill me.  Well, it's any OJ-related stuff.  Always welcome.  Yes.  All right.  We'll put that clip on our website, foundrymusic.com.  We'll give you the plug and stuff.  Cool, bro.  Do you have an email address or something we can put on there?  Yeah, well, kidchris at AOL.com.  Look at you.  You've got the kidchris at AOL.com.  Nice.  Two Ds, extra D for dollars.  Someone else out there has kidchris583 because you have the original one.  Yeah, well, good.  All right.

He's on after us in Sacramento.  That's funny stuff.  That is funny.  We'll put that on foundrymusic.com, F-O-U-N-D-R-Y, music.com.  Is it up there already?  Yo, yo, juice.  Yo, juice.  I love that.  Yeah, who is this?  Did I go kill some chicks?  I got to go.  I'm having dinner with people I plan on killing later.  Would you not call me? 
[00:52:00]  Steve already put it up there.  Oh, great.  So check it out on Foundry Music.  It gets funnier the more you hear it.  Yeah.  We heard it at least ten times.  Great stuff.  We had the OJ 911 crank call bit?  Yeah.  All right.  We'll play this as we go to break.  We'll be back.  Is OJ putting out a prank call tape?  Is that what's going on here?  The best of OJ.  Right.  I call 911 around the country.  Get my 911 comedy tape.  OJ calls 911. 
[00:52:30]  Hello, 911?  911 operator.  Is your refrigerator running there?  Yes, it is.  Well, you better take it.  911?  911, what's your emergency?  Hello, do you have Prince Albert in a can?  What do you mean?  Do you have Prince Albert in a can?  Yes, we do.  Well, you better let him out before he suffocates.  That's the OJ Simpson 911 comedy tape.  Order yours now. 
[00:53:00]  Hello, is this 911?  Yes.  Do you have 10-pound balls?  Yes, we do.  How do you walk?  You'll skip a bunch of OJ Simpson.  I got to go now.  I got to find her. 
[00:53:30]  He's all concerned.  Man, is he bored, huh?  Oh, man.  I was hoping he would do the famous butt plug.  I got to try to call it.  Hello, 911?  Yes.  I'm looking for Michael Hunt.  Is he there?  He goes by the name of Mike.  Laugh along with your favorite murderer, OJ. 
[00:54:00]  911?  Yes?  Uh, butt plug.  Bug box?  Butt plug.  What are you looking for?  Butt plug.  Butt plug.  Don't make me cut your throat, mother.  Does OJ do any, like, character voices on his prank call tape?  Kind of like the jerky voices? 
[00:54:30]  I'll come down there with my toolbox.  I'll bash your head in with a ratchet.  Or a knife.  I'm OJ.  Oops, I just cut myself on a piece of foam rubber.  I better fly to Chicago.  Chicago.  Oh, man.  That's the OJ Simpson 911 comedy tape.  Order yours now. 
[00:55:00]  Look at OJ.  Boom.  The Opie and Anthony show.  I find the most erratic part of a woman is the boobies.  Ah, we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Instant feedback coming in like crazy.  Mookie from Buffalo.  Please play the OJ tape again.  My girlfriend missed it.  It's going to be on foundrymusic.com. 
[00:55:30]  I'm hearing it is on foundrymusic.com.  F-O-U-N-D-R-Y music dot com.  Pretty much everything we talk about on the radio show, you can find later on that website.  It's our underground website, okay?  Uh, Tyrone, check it in.  Tyrone.  Yeah, I'm on the air?  Yeah, Tyrone.  All right, uh, I listen to you guys every day on the way home from work, you know, because  I do work.  I work.  And, uh, you know, I'll get a good laugh, but you're laying the smack down on OJ, and  I think it's a little, I'm a Buffalo boy, you know, West Seneca, New York, right near  Buffalo, and, you know, he was pitted by the government. 
[00:56:00]  You know, he's not guilty.  First of all, take off the fake, uh, dialect that you're putting on.  Yo, what's up with that?  And then tell us your real name.  It's not Tyrone.  Oh, it's Tyrone, eh?  Oh, is it?  Actually, it is Tyrone, but I'm white.  All right, so what's your problem, Tyrone?  Nothing, he was trying to do a bit.  No, actually, not trying to do a bit, I just think, uh, OJ should cut some more, uh, white  women's throats.  All right.  See?  Thank you, Tyrone. 
[00:56:30]  There he is.  Very funny stuff from, uh, Tyrone.  I didn't like him at the beginning of the call, I did at the end.  You did?  Yes.  The slit their throats thing?  That won me over.  Uh, Joey's calling me out of something.  OPU tool.  Every day you're on, you short the distance between 57th Street and Ground Zero.  I just heard you're two miles away now.  You are no less than seven to eight miles from the bomb site, you tool.  Ben will back me.  How far are we really?  Like three miles?  Tops?  I did say two today. 
[00:57:00]  Yes, two and a half from my house to here.  I'm going to drop it a tenth of a mile every day now.  It's about three miles.  That guy's a moron.  All right.  By next month, though, the towers would have been four miles north of us.  Hey, we got the gang from, uh, technicalvirgin.com coming in.  Ooh.  In just a minute here.  I just got to say, uh, really fast that I'm...  Oh, you didn't know they were coming in?  When did that happen?  The last minute stuff.  When I was trying to commute in while you were stuck in traffic. 
[00:57:30]  You know something?  Also, let me...  While you're stuck in traffic, we try to work on the show a little bit.  Try to work on the show?  Oh, good.  Thank God someone has...  I thought you were the champ, McMurphy.  See?  Yeah.  Let me, um...  Let me just say something quickly.  I'll bash the news organizations here in New York.  Okay.  I am trying to figure out what the driving restrictions are going to be here in Manhattan.  Giuliani has said that single passenger vehicles will not be allowed in Manhattan beneath 62nd Street.  Now, I'm reading half the sites I look at, it says 6 a.m. to noon. 
[00:58:00]  The other half, 6 a.m. to midnight.  There's a slight discrepancy there that might affect a couple of people.  12 hours to be exact.  Right.  People got to understand how...  Can I get a real answer to this goddamn question?  People have got to understand how insane this is for New York City.  Hey, you know something?  If it's 6 a.m. to noon, I fall into the Opie category of, do I care?  This doesn't affect me.  Right. 
[00:58:30]  All of a sudden, I fall into that because that's all he was saying.  When I assumed it was 6 a.m. to midnight, which I've read on a lot of this, I'm like,  Ann, stop your bitching.  I could care less.  It doesn't affect me personally.  It's all Opie's saying in the back office.  How does this affect me?  Do I care?  I don't care.  Like we don't think like that as a society?  Of course we don't.  So now I'm reading 6 a.m. to noon, I'm like, hey, it doesn't affect me.  It makes my commuting easier.  But I didn't like that.  You'll do a complete about-face if that's the case.  So jackass subway guy, screw off. 
[00:59:00]  You will leave all your brethren out there.  Defensing themselves.  Not my problem.  And an hour ago, you were the leader of the movement.  I backed Giuliani on this wholeheartedly.  If it's till noon.  If it's till noon?  If it's till midnight, I curse him.  If it's till noon, you have the easiest commute in the world.  Of course.  Of course.  If you go either way, either it's going to be a complete nightmare for you or it's going  to be great.  We'll see.  But you were talking and sharing something.  I hope you were being insensitive.  I do believe you're right, Norton.  You were being insensitive.  Well, let me tell you guys something. 
[00:59:30]  I am a complete loser and I openly admit it.  I think you're selfish.  I am the worst boyfriend in the world.  I went to Phantom of the Opera last night.  How was it?  It's-  Howdy, faggot.  And I couldn't fake it.  I'm the worst.  I should get my girlfriend a gigolo.  To treat her right.  Just to go out with her and go to these plays and treat her right.  To bang her right.  To do everything she needs.  Why would you go to see that?  Because I stink.  It's called breaking up. 
[01:00:00]  When you get another guy to do everything for your chick, it's called breaking up.  But it's not going to get better because then the next one will come along and I'll still  be the worst.  So now, how was it bad that you went with her?  A week ago or so, Sandy, my girlfriend, finds out that you can get Broadway tickets really  easily because of what happened.  Sure.  And she's wanted to see Phantom of the Opera, I guess, for many years.  So she comes to the station and goes, hey, I got Phantom of the Opera tickets. 
[01:00:30]  So I'm just assuming.  I'm like, great, who are you going to bring?  Thinking I am completely in the clear.  Right.  She gives me that look.  And you know Sandy.  She could get to you.  The look that means?  She goes, well, I thought we'd go together.  I have Phantom tickets.  And I'm like, but I'm thinking, I swear to God, it didn't even cross my mind that she  wanted to go with me.  I'm like, cool, you got Phantom tickets, you can bring your mom, your sis, somebody.  So I'm like, happy for her. 
[01:01:00]  And then she goes, well, I thought we would go.  I'm like, oh.  So then I openly go, oh, which just kills the moment.  So then last night was Broadway night.  And she shows up to the station early, all dressed up for Broadway.  So would you go to the room, get dressed?  No, no.  I didn't even want to.  No, I didn't want to stay in the crack hotel last night.  I just wanted to get the play over with and I wanted to get home.  So wait, she got all dressed to go to the play.  What were you wearing?  Did you see what I'm wearing today?  No joke.  The only difference, you see this shirt? 
[01:01:30]  Yeah.  Same style shirt, different color.  I'd rather have a girl walk in today.  Because I got three for one deal the other day.  No, just kidding.  They're nice.  So she shows up like you should dress for, I guess, Broadway.  And I'm a complete loser.  You're the messy guy that when you go to a show and, you know, you kind of get dressed nice.  You don't have to go in a tuxedo.  But you do kind of get dressed nice because it's a night out.  And you sit down and you watch the slobs come in.  That's amazing.  Dressed like slobs.  And you'll just look and go, you're ruining the Broadway experience here for the rest of 
[01:02:00]  the people.  Everyone dressed up, excited.  We grabbed pizza.  I got my backpack.  I got my sketchers on.  This ain't a I'm going to get you sucker.  In the movie theater.  Come on.  Jeans with holes in it and this shirt with no collar.  What do you I don't even know what you call it.  Just a piece of crap.  I know.  Long sleeve t-shirt.  When I go to shows, it's the people like you that we point out and go, oh, look, could  you friggin put on a shirt or something nice?  You it ruins the experience for everyone else going to the show. 
[01:02:30]  You like to think you're going to something a little nicer than just the movies.  You get a little culture.  What happened to you?  What?  Seven years ago, the best shirt you own was a Jack Daniels t-shirt.  What the hell are you saying?  Look, I'm wearing my Arapastel shirt.  Look at you upgrading with the new contract.  Yeah.  Wear the t-shirt.  So now I'm at the Phantom of the Opera with all these couples that are in love.  And I mean, I'm, you know.  The music of the night. 
[01:03:00]  In your mind.  Whatever.  And then it's like it's not even.  I was trying to explain to Anthony at lunch today.  It's not even like a regular musical where you're like, all right, I'm here.  But I can deal and I understand what they're singing so I can follow the story.  It's Phantom of the Opera.  So they kind of have that opera singing going on.  Oh, brother.  Double whammy.  You got to try to understand what the F they're saying.  And I'm sitting there and I'm hating it.  You were like you wanted to go see what?  Like Lion King.  So you could tap your foot to the numbers. 
[01:03:30]  I would have.  You know what?  Call me a fag.  I would have rather gone to Lion King.  There you go.  I would have rather gone to Stomp.  Stomp.  Rent.  Mm-hmm.  I don't know.  Annie gets your.  Your.  Your.  Danny gets your gun.  What about the penis puppet guys?  Why don't you go there?  So.  So then like halfway through it she's crying and she's like having a good time.  Wait.  Was she crying?  Yeah.  I guess it's an emotional story.  Oh.  I thought she was crying.  Maybe she was just embarrassed with how you were impressed.  I was thinking that. 
[01:04:00]  She's crying and stuff because I guess it's like a pretty emotional story.  I don't know.  I am.  What were you doing?  Were you watching it?  Well I got in trouble.  And you're watching it, Hooper.  I got in trouble because I was really bored and I was trying to like you know occupy myself  so now I'm taking the program and making it into a little spyglass.  A telescope with the program?  Yeah.  And I'm just kind of checking out the you know the stage with that.  That's great.  That didn't go over well.  That's great.  That's classy.  Yeah.  That's a classy move.  And then she goes are you having a good time?  And then this is where I stink as a boyfriend.  You would think you know well obviously she's having fun and this is a really big deal for her. 
[01:04:30]  You'd think I could fake it.  Yeah.  I go no and I hold my arms.  Oh boy.  He's a spoiled sport.  You know something?  You are a spoiled sport.  So then it's the big finale.  Shenanigans.  The big finale finale of Phantom of the Opera.  Of the opera.  Whatever.  Of the opera.  Phantom of the opera.  Whatever.  Well that would have been a better show Phantom of the Opera.  It's the cat on a hot tin opera.  Right.  We went to tavern on the roof before Phantom in the opera. 
[01:05:00]  So then the big final scene and now she's completely losing it and the standing ovations and stuff.  And I'm like well what just happened?  Oh boy.  I'm like isn't the Phantom a ghost?  She goes no he's not a ghost.  He's been.  He lives under the stage or something.  He's been alive the whole show.  You see he was born deformed and this is the only way he could live behind the scenes and in the shadows.  And I'm like oh I didn't know.  How long was the play honestly?  Two and a half hours.  So for two and a half hours you couldn't just hang out and fake that you were having a good time for your girlfriend's benefit. 
[01:05:30]  No.  I'm admitting it openly to 15 cities.  I stink as a boyfriend.  I'm the worst.  Yeah.  And then she goes did you like it?  I'm like well it was okay.  Wow that is sad.  Just ruined her night on Broadway.  So if anyone wants to bang my girlfriend let me know.  Oh Jesus man. 
[01:06:00]  You didn't see Legs Diamond?  Huh?  I mean someone else would treat her nice.  I'm the worst.  She's so nice too.  Comes in with some Phantom tickets.  I come in here and you're Jewish today.  I mean you.  I was a nice girlfriend.  I'm just telling everyone how pathetic I am.  I am Louis.  I'm awful.  That's it.  That's Jewish.  I'm just not a good boyfriend.  I know.  I couldn't guilt and suffering.  It's all about the Jewish religion.  I couldn't suck it up and just deal with the fact that I was going to Phantom of the Opera with the chick. 
[01:06:30]  Well you know it's wrong to be going to that.  Okay.  You give the money and that's it.  And you don't watch it because I think it takes years off your life.  Oh something like that?  The chandelier comes crashing down on the audience and almost hits everyone.  Oh that's also the ooh.  It was a big special effect thing I guess.  Great.  Did you jump and go oh now this is good.  Now it's getting good.  Great.  Just what an audience in New York needs.  Stuff falling on it.  Great.  Good move.  Good move. 
[01:07:00]  And then the Japanese guy to Sandy's right on the other side there.  Sleeping.  Sleeping.  Yeah.  She's getting pissed off at him even.  I'm like look man.  I don't know the guy.  Let me tell everybody around the country about the Japs that come to New York.  A lot of businessmen.  A lot of businessmen.  They're an ally now.  Japanese businessmen.  They're not an ally.  They're a conquered nation that'll do anything so we don't nuke them again.  What they do.  They get these tickets to the Broadway shows when they go on these business trips to New York.  They have nothing else to do. 
[01:07:30]  So they go to these shows.  They don't care about them and they fall asleep.  One of the hugest shows for that used to be Cats.  Remember that abortion before it closed?  Thank God that closed.  Thank God.  You know what they should have done?  You know what they should have done?  I escaped the Cats.  Crap.  You know what they should have done with Cats when they closed it?  Take the cast.  Put them in a big like box with holes in it and put it in the river and drown them.  Just like real cats.  Wouldn't that have been a great way to close the show?  A big box that looks like a small one but only big? 
[01:08:00]  It would have been nicer if they just called the show Nats.  And you actually went and there was nothing on the stage.  You had to imagine what was going on.  It would have been better off.  You would have been better off.  It would have been cool if it was Cats and it was all black guys.  Like 70s pimp type guys.  Yo, Cat.  Hey, Big Cat.  What's up?  I don't want to say anything about your experience on your big night out of Broadway or anything,  but are you kidding me?  You didn't know that the Phantom wasn't a ghost? 
[01:08:30]  No.  Where would I read this, Cat?  Now, it was a movie, it was a horror movie.  Let me tell you something.  It was a horror movie before they decided to make it into a goddamn musical.  It was three horror movies before.  Right, right.  Who was it?  Lon Chaney?  Yes.  That was one.  Played the Phantom of the Opera.  I thought he was in the holes.  Lon Chaney Jr.?  I thought he wasn't real.  Did he play another one?  What about Bela Lugosi?  Eddie.  Eddie, I can't play the Phantom. 
[01:09:00]  Pull this thing!  Before you twisted up the program, you should have read it.  I don't like reading.  I'm with all these.  Before you twisted up the program, really.  This is what I really thought.  I thought the Phantom was a ghost, she falls in love with a ghost.  Obviously, that can't happen, and there's the dilemma.  I love reading the program so I can find out who the understudy is and what they've been in.  That's what I like about the program.  You figure you're sitting in a room and a story is taking place, and you don't understand it because of the singing or whatever. 
[01:09:30]  You might want to check the program to see what's going on.  Got a little background.  You would think.  That's why I'm the worst.  I'm not trying to defend myself.  I stink, as Norton would say.  Abbott and Costello meet the Phantom of the Opera, right?  No, they never made that one.  Can I tell you guys the honest truth?  I swear, I was this close to doing it, and that's when my brain finally said, you know what?  You clicked in.  Cut it out.  In my book bag that I brought to the Phantom of the Opera.  Don't even.  Oh, you didn't go to the book bag.  Hold on. 
[01:10:00]  I'll say what it is.  I know exactly what he's going to say.  I'll finish what you're saying.  And wait, I got to tell, because I swear, I need to set this up.  This is not a bit for the radio.  It knows me.  This is something I really thought of doing, and I decided at the last minute that it might  not be a good thing to do.  All right.  I'll even say it, and I swear to God, he hasn't even said anything to me about this.  In his book bag, he has his portable DVD player, which he was going to pull out and either  watch, A, the rest of American Pie unedited, or B, the horror movie Boogeyman clips from, 
[01:10:30]  no, it was going to be American Pie, and it was going to be the scene we all saw in the  office before the show yesterday, the famous scene where the exchange student gets naked,  and everyone on the internet gets to check it out.  You know, very good.  I was this close.  Oh, my God.  Can you imagine the people behind Opie sitting there as he's watching a naked woman?  Because I didn't know what to do.  I didn't know what to do, because, Kev, I did look in the program for one thing to  see how many scenes they had.  Yeah, there's always a hundred. 
[01:11:00]  Well, no, then I could count down.  I'm like, okay, seven scenes to go, six scenes to go, five, and I even had it figured out,  because then you forget which scenes are coming up, so I'm like, okay, remember graveyard  scene, graveyard scene, that means only three scenes left in this.  What'd you do for intermission?  Drink.  Did you drink?  No, because you know.  Oh, you got to drink at intermission.  I just went to the bathroom.  I run like the kid runs to the ice cream truck.  When all of a sudden the lights start going on, I'm like, I can't wait online. 
[01:11:30]  So I start running up the aisle, Jack and Coke, Jack and Coke, Jack and Coke, get the  guy mixing it before I even get there.  Yeah, I don't even drink, and I had to drink at Phantom of the Opera.  That's good, huh?  Yeah.  All right, take care, guys.  Women should bring their female friends or their moms and stuff, because they know what  creeps we are, and we don't get into that stuff.  See, but I don't do enough stuff with my girl.  That's the problem.  So I got to suck it up every once in a while, and I don't even do that well.  Gary, what's up? 
[01:12:00]  Hope, you're being way too hard on yourself.  I was there last night as well, and I want to tell you something.  I was with a large group of people, and it was so painful to watch.  All I cared about was a special effect, and otherwise, I had the worst headache, and at  intermission, I sucked down about five beers, because I just couldn't take it.  When they do that flash?  Oh, it was brutal.  That flash was like the best thing in the whole play.  Dude, burn my retina.  Stop it.  Did it burn your retina, Gary?  What is it?  Can I ask you a question?  I was seeing spots for 20 minutes, because I don't know.  What did they do? 
[01:12:30]  It was like a nuclear flash.  Flash powder?  Why are all the women crying?  Because basically, the guy is just a serial killer who's a jealous guy who goes around  killing everybody.  Yeah, death and destruction everywhere, and the girls in the audience fall in love with  the guy, because it's not about his looks.  It's about his heart.  They're also crying because he's singing crap.  It's an Andrew Lloyd Webber cry.  I would rather watch him go to the bathroom on stage.  You know what's amazing?  I think that's the follow-up.  Women cry and stuff like that, and yet no woman will bang a deformed guy. 
[01:13:00]  Yeah.  Hallelujah.  God, Daniel.  Did you have to drive back to Lone Island with her, with your girlfriend?  How many?  Yeah.  That was the worst.  I'm in Jersey, and she kept asking me how come I didn't like it, and the best part,  and I was like you.  I just totally kind of clammed up and told her I hated it, and she was pissed off at  me the whole ride home.  Gary, what was your favorite part?  I liked when Hans Gruber went into the thing to smoke the cigarette, and he...  Oh, sorry.  That was something else I was dreaming I was watching.  Two and a half hours of opera singing. 
[01:13:30]  It's the worst.  They toned down the opera singing, but it's opera singing.  I was just trying to...  I thought it was cool when he was going over, like, the fog, and that was it.  Otherwise, I couldn't take any of it.  Inside your mind.  Well, you know what?  Try getting a chick to watch Full Metal Jacket without running up to the bathroom.  No, you don't have to pause it.  You're not going to get a girl to watch Full Metal Jacket, so why should we watch plays?  All right, Gary.  Thank you.  Hey, thanks, guys.  Take care.  Bye.  What a great point Norton brought up, though.  They won't bang the deformed guys.  You know, how many girls cry over the hunchback of Notre Dame? 
[01:14:00]  Yeah.  Poor guy.  But, you know, you don't see him riding that hump.  Exactly.  No way.  Shed a few tears, but don't drink out of his humped mule.  All right, we have to take a break.  Lewis Black is back to continue.  Lewis.  He started yesterday.  I'm even more pissed.  I didn't even start it.  I'll even say, I know I started it, and I'm even more pissed now that I thought about  it and heard more speeches and read more takes on things.  I'm very pissed.  Yeah, we'll get into it next, because when you get started, we go a half hour. 
[01:14:30]  Okay.  Also, we have, do we have Bad Ronald here?  They're here.  Half of Bad Ronald is here.  They're going to do some raps and stuff.  Oh, yeah, we've got to get the guy from Technical Virgin in here.  The guy from Technical Virgin?  Yeah.  Hey.  I thought there were going to be girls from Technical Virgin.  No.  You, no.  You can't just say that.  You're allowed to say that.  No, you're allowed.  Oh, come on.  This is not the Daily Show, my friend. 
[01:15:00]  Hold on, hold on.  Please.  In the name of heaven.  We're running out of delay.  Yeah.  You can't say the T-words.  For the love of Eve, you can't say that.  It's a medical word.  But it did not allow to be said.  You can't say it.  This isn't comedy central, my friend.  I know.  Where the S-word flies.  Lois, we are responsible broadcasters here.  Oh, man.  You should follow our lead.  You cannot say that.  Disrespectful of the women.  We say breasts.  Right.  Yes.  That's what we say.  Like, because you don't want to be disrespectful. 
[01:15:30]  You say, hey, look at that effing horse.  They won't even let you spell it, Lois.  Yeah.  Oh, come on.  That's not even the spelling.  You can't spell it.  But that's not even the spelling.  I can't even spell it.  You can't.  Come on.  You can't even spell it on the radio, Lois.  You know, hello, we're at the edge of tomorrow, and let's stop using all language.  I like it.  I spelt it wrong.  On purpose.  Don't spell.  Can't even spell.  All right.  We're on the top of the roller coaster of doom, and we're worried about how it's tomorrow. 
[01:16:00]  Is that a new soap opera?  Yeah, exactly.  Lois is with his new partner, and they don't know which one has HIV.  How old are you?  18.  All right.  Oh, you showed up.  Wow.  Fabulous.  Wow.  Opie and Anthony.  This is the Opie and Anthony show.  Oi.  Peter's pissed off at us. 
[01:16:30]  What now?  Peter, what's wrong?  Yo.  What's up?  Make it fast, Peter.  It's this kid again.  Yes, it's me again.  Oh, you.  Bye-bye.  I was not.  Bye-bye.  He said his dad died, but we don't believe it.  At the towers.  And then he goes, but at least we got $100,000.  So then we lost our minds and said you're an idiot for, like, getting on the radio this way, 
[01:17:00]  and now he's saying it's true, but we don't believe it.  If he's telling the truth, it's an awful, awful thing.  Yeah.  Of course.  But then you don't call up a radio station and then say, you know, we got $100,000.  Exactly.  Lewis Black in the studio from Comedy Central, The Daily Show.  Jim Norton in the studio.  Jim's in the latest issue of Penthouse.  Nice Q&A section with Jim Norton.  Really funny stuff.  And outside the studio, we got Bad Ronald, Anthony.  Yeah.  Stinky's new best friends.  Oh, yeah.  They love each other. 
[01:17:30]  They were just in the little vestibule out there, chit-chatting.  Chit-chatting.  Chit-chatting.  A little chit-chatting going on.  A little chit-chat.  A little chit-chat.  A little chit-chat.  Ben and Stinky went to see Bad Ronald a couple weeks ago, and they all hit it off.  So, I wonder what they have in common.  What's the common denominator there?  Hmm.  I wonder.  I would say liver failure.  They did a wow song for us.  They're going to do that live.  Because it is Whip-Em-Out Wednesday once again today, as we try to head back towards some  kind of normalcy. 
[01:18:00]  Ugh.  Whatever that is.  Stinky.  Hello, young man.  How you doing, Stinky?  Look at Stinky's eyes.  Stinky, man.  Oh, my God.  What?  You got a job to do, yo.  I'm answering phones.  Wow.  He looked over his shoulder when he said that.  You're very functional, though.  Pop must be really good if you still think you could answer phones from the vestibule.  Joe, was that that stuff that, like, was smelling in the bag really strong?  No, no.  It's actually their own homegrown stuff.  Really?  It was sweet.  Wow. 
[01:18:30]  Good stuff, huh?  Yeah, very good.  You look Asian right now.  Yeah.  I've never seen your eyes, like, really that glazed over and everything.  I don't know.  It's pretty good.  Dude, be cool, man.  Be cool.  My mom's listening.  She thinks I smoke a lot of pot.  My mom's coming to pick us up, man.  Where's the Visine and Tic Tacs?  Be cool.  I don't know what words they can't say.  Yeah.  Good deal.  Isn't that weird?  Stinky's personality, either pot or booze. 
[01:19:00]  Like, pot, it's the mellow Stinky.  It's just like, yeah, no, it's cool.  I'm out there talking.  And then booze, it's, woo!  You know, he's just an animal.  I like it.  Very good, Stink.  And you wore your...  Small weed every day.  You wore the big wazoo shirt.  Today is syndicated shirt day, and you're the only one that wore a shirt from one of  the markets.  Hey, I started, and I gave up, because no one would do it with me.  Stinky's still hanging in there. 
[01:19:30]  What a guy.  What a guy.  We'll do it next Wednesday, all right?  Next Wednesday, everyone does it.  I'm going for the KXOA shirt, though.  Where do I get the BUF shirt?  I'm going BCN.  No offense to our Buffalo station, but we don't like the t-shirts you sent us.  It's just plain.  Plain.  KXOA gave us the best shirt so far.  That's the problem.  Only two of them have really cool shirts.  We only wear the BCN and the KOXOA.  That's the only ones we wear.  Everyone else think you're wearing the big wazoo.  Everyone else has the white radio station t-shirt. 
[01:20:00]  Yeah, the one they throw out.  The big wazoo.  YSP has those.  JFK has those.  BUF and JFK, very similar t-shirts.  We will wear the shirts from the other cities, but, you know, you've got to step up a little.  These are like the old concert t-shirts where you put it in the wash, and all of a sudden  it's a midriff top.  All right.  So, Lewis, you doing better today?  I'm doing all right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know. 
[01:20:30]  I don't know.  I've got to do the show tonight.  I've got to do the show today.  Oh, you do?  This will be the first show I've done since this happened, so.  Oh, really?  So we get to see you cry.  Awesome.  Nice.  I won't be crying.  Are you going to get out there and, you know, it's been two weeks, and I think I'm the last  person to cry about this on television, but.  No, I won't cry.  No.  We were talking about this with Ron and Fez.  You don't want to be the last guy crying on TV.  No.  And so far, it's John Stewart, right?  It's all right for Letterman and Stewart and the rest of them, but somebody's going to be the last 
[01:21:00]  one.  Who's the last guy?  It was John Stewart so far, I think.  No, Jimmy Kimmel.  Jimmy Kimmel.  Jimmy Kimmel's the last guy.  Kimmel cried.  He cried big time in the NFL.  Nothing wrong with that, but we're just saying, you know, you don't want to be the last guy  crying on TV.  Well, he was giving his scores?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Something like that.  Right before he gave his scores.  He kind of gave a little thing and kind of lost his mind, and then he went to the scores.  Wow.  Yeah, no, I will not be.  All right.  But you're going to kind of, you know, lose your mind a little bit about this whole situation.  Well, yeah.  I'm going to probably be the first one of the, we'll be the, it'll be the, tonight may be 
[01:21:30]  the first show where we kind of break the ice about talking about it.  Touch on it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know.  Because I've been, I've been actually out there performing, so.  Yeah.  Last night I noticed, yeah, you guys aren't touching on it at all, really, which is cool.  No, but I've been around the country, so I had to do it.  You get on stage, you can't avoid it.  What are you going to say?  Well, you know, nothing happened.  One girl, the girl who opened for me was terrific.  She goes, you know, you know, it was terrible what happened.  I've got nothing else to say.  My stuff that I do as a comic is really stupid, so let's move on. 
[01:22:00]  There you go.  You've got to hand it to her.  It's one way to get past that.  Is that the redhead?  No, that was in Alex.  No, this was out in San Francisco.  Yeah, the redhead is really funny.  She's funny.  No, this was, she was funny.  But I started basically by saying it was really nice to be a topical comic until last Tuesday.  Yeah.  And I said, I'm on the plane, and we're flying out, and I'm going through my luggage looking  for a sock and a crayon so I can make a sock puppet.  Because I think it's time my act changed. 
[01:22:30]  And then I was thinking, it was maybe some props.  Does anybody have a feminine hygiene spray on board?  And then I asked the audience if anybody could teach me some magic tricks.  Maybe you could bring cute animals on stage with you.  Exactly.  And Louis Black with cute animals.  People love cute animals.  Yeah, but now, you know what I would do with a cute animal.  You know what I mean?  Give me a little bunny.  Give me a little bunny.  Snap it.  Snap it.  Same thing you do while babysitting.  A lot of shh.  The only good thing is that animals can keep a secret. 
[01:23:00]  Right?  Oh, man.  You know what, Norton?  Shh.  Never good.  Never good.  You're right.  Nothing good ever comes out of shh.  But someone's going shh.  Right.  Never good.  Never good.  Now, Louis, we kind of had a little discussion late in the show yesterday about the situation  and the military response that is yet to come.  But, you know, today, though, do you realize today, there is absolutely no one in the world  having any diplomatic relationships at all with Afghanistan? 
[01:23:30]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  They all pulled the play.  Except for Pakistan, right?  Well, no, Pakistan, everybody's got...  They're the last ones talking to me.  Yeah.  They're the ones who are kind of recognizing...  Yeah, but they're all...  Because their own people will go crazy.  But also, they pulled all their people out.  Yeah.  And also, Pakistan's the only one that we've got to go up there, you know, that has a Dixie  cup and a string and can talk to them still.  Right.  Yeah.  It's the line of communication there.  Yeah.  It's the last ones going, excuse me, maybe today, maybe today, you get him today. 
[01:24:00]  Yeah, yeah, today.  That's it.  You go home today.  Yeah.  They dress you up in the suit, bring you out, back in the cell.  Yeah.  Mind F you.  So it'll be...  So I think you're going to get...  Something's going to happen in the next two days.  Well, um...  That's my guess.  I don't know.  You know what I'm seeing now?  And I've gotten this information after yesterday's conversation, Louis.  From where?  From my own head.  It's the best.  From military command.  From military command.  From interviews.  From interviews I've seen. 
[01:24:30]  You're the best.  And websites.  I can't...  You know what it is?  Get this.  Get this now.  I'm with you.  The goddamn president and the secretary of state there, Colin Powell, secretary of defense,  they're all lulling us to sleep right now.  There's not going to be anything happening.  They're waiting.  So much time is going on.  And the tone of their speeches is turning from what it was a couple of weeks ago of, 
[01:25:00]  oh my God, we're going to find these people and it's not going to be this courtroom stuff.  We're going to go in.  We're going to kill, kill, kill.  You know, and everyone was like, we're ready to go.  Now, the language of the speeches have turned a little.  Now they're talking about the justice angle.  And we'll hunt them down and bring them to justice.  And it's not going to be the conventional war that we're used to seeing.  They keep telling us that.  There's not going to be this big invasion that everyone's waiting for.  So what they're doing, as time goes by, more of the language like this is going to come out in the speeches. 
[01:25:30]  Until, before you know it, six months goes by.  Everyone's like, you know, nothing in this country has blown up in the last, what, six months.  We're cool, I guess.  Everyone forgets about it.  Business as usual.  That's what I see happening.  And I'm pissed about it.  You know, that's why you're not on ABC tonight.  Why is that?  Because that's a psychotic analysis.  It's a good analysis of what's happening.  Oh, and when are you going to be on with Sam Donaldson, Mr. Comedy Central?  Did I say I would be?  Did I ever say I would be? 
[01:26:00]  But I want to be.  This is coming from the guy that had the bee angle.  Right.  Mr. B's nest analogy.  You've got the beekeeper in the studio, and you're telling him that he's insane.  All I said was, this woman won't get you on ABC.  You're not sensing a language in these speeches that have changed since the two weeks?  My bet is still, two to three days.  Two to three days.  Kaboom.  Something will go kaboom.  Kaboom.  Something will go kaboom.  You said two or three days yesterday, so now we're down to one or two days.  No, we're down to two days, then.  Aren't we, schmuck? 
[01:26:30]  Three minus one is two.  You know, it's unbelievable.  Will they have renamed it Operation Ooh, Stop That?  So as not to offend somebody?  Operation Slap on the Hand.  No, partly I think, partly it may be the lulling thing, and I'm hoping it is, has to do with  kind of going, you know, bam!  Bam!  Oh, you think so?  You know, I would love if that happened.  But I think it is.  But you know what it's doing?  People are saying, oh, if we bomb, we're going to upset the coalition that's been put together. 
[01:27:00]  Now, if we bombed right afterwards, the coalition wouldn't be upset.  But now, as time goes on, they're going to get that whole thing where they're going, eh,  we kind of forgot the horror and tragedy of this whole thing.  It goes away.  You know, right after it happened, we can turn around.  But in the midst of all this, too, you know, the other thing is, which is why I think something's  going to happen, is we're moving people around right and left.  There are people all over the place.  Oh, we're getting in place.  We are definitely in place.  We know that.  Well, we're definitely in place.  Yeah, but you know something?  You know what I hear from my military forces?  You know what a lot of these reservists... 
[01:27:30]  I love the concept of you sitting around in a T-shirt in a bar with six guys in uniform.  Military...  In general school.  I am an insider.  Now, you know what I heard?  All the people that are being called up from the reserves, everyone's thinking, oh, this  is going to be this big thing.  They're for national defense right here in the U.S. of A.  They're going to be guarding places.  They're putting them around the...  It's not so they could go and kick someone's ass overseas.  Well, it's Homeland Security. 
[01:28:00]  Homeland Security.  Which sounds a little weird to me, doesn't it?  That sounds a little, you know, goose-steppy.  Fatherland Security.  It doesn't sound right.  It sounds like that, or really a great name for somebody who locks doors.  You know?  Get your...  Yeah.  It's something like you guys would do an ad for.  Well, you know, with the things that have happened, time for Homeland Security.  I hear they're putting all the mall cops on alert, too.  All the mall rent-a-cops with the Smokey the Bear hats.  That they've got to wear in the mall.  Well, the mall cops just like park rangers.  What the hell is that all about? 
[01:28:30]  They teach you how to build a fire in the fountain.  And they'll be carrying bazookas.  Yeah.  That'll be what they're doing.  Because that's what they're doing, too.  I guess they're upping everyone's security there.  You know, they're upping the security everywhere.  So, what about the armed pilots now?  They want to arm the pilots.  Nice.  I don't like the...  I like the idea of someone with guns on the plane.  I hate it.  But the pilot, I like his job being a pilot.  Have you ever talked about...  Not pilot slash security guard.  They're all ex-military, those guys.  Most of them anyway, though.  Most of them are ex-military. 
[01:29:00]  Yeah, but you know something?  These guys are...  He's not flying a Huey.  These guys are...  You know?  He's not flying a Huey into a hot LZ.  He's flying my ass to L.A.  They all have guns.  All the pilots have guns.  No, these guys are insane.  They drink.  They don't sleep.  They can crash the plane if they want to.  You don't want to arm them.  A pilot could crash the plane.  Have you ever hung out with a pilot?  These guys are insane.  Yeah.  No, I want them to have guns.  How relevant is Archie Bunker's speech now?  Remember Archie Bunker's speech from All in the Family?  When he got on one of those news shows... 
[01:29:30]  Remember when they used to just put any Joe up there to give their opinion?  Yes.  It's not necessarily the opinion of this station.  And then some ordinary Joe would get on and give his opinion.  And then the station manager or someone would have a rebuttal.  Archie Bunker did one of these.  And he was talking about all the hijacking that was going on at the time.  And his solution.  He goes, what you got to do is pass out all guns to all the passengers.  And he goes, a hijacker would have to be a nut to pull out a rod when he knows everyone's packing heat. 
[01:30:00]  And then when they get off, they hand back in their guns and go along their business.  And everyone laughed at how ridiculous it sounded.  But now people are like, hey, you know the guy's got a bullet.  You know, the stewardesses give them guns?  No, just the pilots.  Stewardesses, yeah.  The pilots.  Just the pilots have the guns.  You don't get into the cockpit.  They don't open the door for anything.  And if you try to get in, you're shot.  That's what should happen.  You think so?  Yes, absolutely.  Because the only way to control the aircraft is to get into the cockpit.  Give them guns.  I trust them.  I trust them to fly me.  I trust them to have a pistol.  You know, it would have been interesting to have the concept of a lock on the door. 
[01:30:30]  Don't you think?  Of course.  Yeah, more than just the bathroom door.  I mean, in retrospect.  Or at least a sign that says keep out.  Yeah.  Of course.  They got one of those eye hook things.  Yeah.  A little eye hook lock.  And my other favorite was when I'm reading, when you're sitting there and you have to  the thing, you know, and they start going, well, today at the airports, we're going  to begin to do things.  We're going to set everything right here.  You know, and you can't sell knives at airports.  What airport was selling a knife?  Did you ever see a knife or something? 
[01:31:00]  If they were.  Duty-free shops.  You don't.  But, you know, what airport was selling a knife?  Duty-free shops were selling that stuff.  They weren't selling knives?  Yes, they were.  Yeah, they were.  They were.  They were airports selling knives.  That's wonderful.  But what should have been done is any airport that actually was selling knives, we should  have shut down and just blown up.  Because that's clinically insane.  But what terrorist buys a knife on the way into the plane?  I'm sure they show up with them.  That's true.  I was actually getting on the plane and the guy, this is what was occurring.  There's a young Jamaican girl and her father. 
[01:31:30]  She's got a Ginsu knife set that she's passing through.  The Ginsu knife.  Yeah, this is like before the thing occurred.  Oh, my God.  She's passing through and they go, wait, no, you can't take this on the plane.  And his father goes, you know, his father's saying, okay, I'll mail it to you.  You know, so they're having his, and the guy's behind the security going, well, you know,  it's just a gift.  Oh, it's a gift.  It's a gift of weapons.  It's a gift of Ginsu knives.  She's going to be carrying these on the, they're insane.  Do you know someone in Atlanta just the other day got through with a loaded .22 caliber pistol? 
[01:32:00]  Loaded pistol in his pocket.  He walks through security.  It doesn't go off.  He notices in the gate area.  It's like, oh, my God, I brought my gun with me.  He forgot about it.  He goes up to a Delta, somebody at the desk and says, look, I inadvertently brought my gun with me through security.  And they actually arrested him for having a firearm in a restricted area. 
[01:32:30]  But they said, we don't know what happened.  We don't know what happened with the security.  He walked in with a gun.  How about security stinks?  Right.  That's what happened.  Exactly.  Idiots.  All right.  Three days, Lewis?  We're three minus one now.  Two days.  Two more days.  Two days, something will happen.  Two.  Thursday, Friday.  But look who you're talking to.  You bring me on.  I'm sort of like, I know what I'm talking about.  Hey, Lewis, why don't you just stop turning your mic off?  I'm not turning it off.  No, that was Norton who hit the call button on his mic. 
[01:33:00]  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  Oh, God.  Wow.  You know, I remember when we were friends.  Norton just censored you.  He didn't feel right about what you were saying.  I thought this was mine.  I didn't mean to do it.  You don't get it, though.  We feel like we're friends.  We are friends.  We feel like we could completely humiliate you.  That's a sign of a really good friend.  I know it is.  I know.  Remember the days we used to be polite to you?  Oh, yeah.  That lasted an hour.  It lasted 15 minutes.  It lasted until you had three listeners.  Right. 
[01:33:30]  Once you came out, six people are listening.  Don't be an Anthony.  You started after me.  Luke had us two more.  Well, we realized they liked it.  They liked that stuff.  But I don't know crap about this.  I mean, that's where I'm...  You know, I'm lucky I can do my act at this point.  I don't know.  These people, I find...  Look, you're talking to me.  I'm the one who said that this leadership was psychotic all the way along.  That's true.  I'm the one who said, you know, until last...  It's like until last Tuesday, they'd thumb up their hunker. 
[01:34:00]  And then all of a sudden, it's like, after Tuesday, we're geniuses.  You know something?  Now we know what we're doing.  I don't even like that whole angle, too.  His approval rating, 90%.  Shot through the roof.  Yeah, yeah.  These are...  That's bull.  It's people saying, yeah, I approve because we have to stand behind...  Right.  No.  You could stand behind...  Check off the box that says, I will stand behind the president.  Check off the box that I still think he's a blithering idiot. 
[01:34:30]  You could do that.  Well, the whole thing is, the thing is, is that just because, you know, it's like, well,  he's the commander-in-chief.  It's not like we have a choice.  Right.  It's not like we're going to line up behind Yos...  Oh, it'll be the...  It's either him or Yosemite Sam.  We've got him.  See, but it doesn't mean you stop listening to him.  Yeah.  And then you're listening to him, and now you're going to sleep.  I don't like what he's saying.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They're changing directions.  You know, they had told us this was a war.  Every two seconds, Bush gets on TV. 
[01:35:00]  He's using the term war.  Yeah.  He uses the word.  We're at war.  This is a war against terrorism.  A war has been declared against the United States.  And you know what?  I'm not seeing war.  No.  Everything I owe it, but it's not a war that we're used to.  It's a war with no one on the opposing side getting killed.  You know, I don't like that war.  So what you're saying is our stuff gets blown up and our people die, but theirs doesn't.  Yeah, I like the old war better.  I like the old war where their people died more than our people died. 
[01:35:30]  We win.  Good war.  Right?  Great war.  Great war.  I like that war better.  More better war.  Could you wear the beekeeper outfit tonight on the show for us?  I will not wear the beekeeper outfit tonight.  Huge ratings.  I smell ratings.  Oh, yeah.  And have the smoke to lull the bees.  As you lose your effing mind.  Yeah.  The small beekeeper outfit.  You know what would be funny if somebody came out with a beekeeper outfit and squirted a  smoke on Lewis when he loses his mind to calm him down?  And then you could, you know what you could do?  You could suggest that we kill the terrorists by getting them in the Houston Astrodome and

[01:52:30]  WNW  WNW  WNW  And we're back with the OB and Anthony show  Bad Ronald hanging out with us  Yeah  They sounded real good  Jim Norton in the studio  He's in the latest issue of Penthouse Magazine  A quick one-page Q&A that is really, really funny 
[01:53:00]  Pick that up if you get a chance  Yeah  And yesterday we were talking about  Something that's going on in Boston, Anthony  We hear about this from time to time  Boston, of course, a huge college town  And a lot of girls, they want to keep their virginity until marriage  But what do you do?  You know, you want to stay a virgin until marriage  But you're getting those urges  Maybe the boyfriend's pressuring you a little  And you want to make sure you keep him  So what do you do?  So the trend up in Boston is to have 
[01:53:30]  The backdoor sex  Backdoor action  So officially you're still a virgin  And you can save that for marriage  Which, of course  The guy from Rolling Stone Magazine  Who interviewed us  Swore that it was true  Yeah  We've done some research  Girls give it up  The girls started calling us yesterday  And they told us  Yeah, it's kind of true  It's a trend up in Boston  Imagine that  So then we got turned on to a website called technicalvirgin.com  And it had us laughing pretty hard yesterday  And, John, I'm assuming you're the owner of technicalvirgin.com, right? 
[01:54:00]  Yep, my pal Dave Mack and I are the producers of that site  Are you still a virgin?  Well, you'll have to ask my wife  Just by the looks of you, I thought you might still be a virgin  No, just kidding  How the hell did you get started with this thing?  Well, as usually  Before this kind of thing  It got started  Well, we got pissed off  You got pissed off  We got pissed off at the whole  Not me, not now campaign 
[01:54:30]  Right, right  With the hot little Catholic school girl  Out in the outfit  Getting up there and saying  Well, I'm not going to do anything  Right, not me, not now  Not me, not now  And also it's like  That pissed me off, too  Yeah, we were looking at it  And we're going, you know  Mom and dad  Her mom and dad  Are like  You know, doing it like bunnies in their bedroom  Right?  They're getting off as much as they want  As often as they want  But they're telling her  She's not supposed to do anything  It's like  The person who's getting it  Is telling the person who's not getting it  That they shouldn't 
[01:55:00]  That didn't seem right to us  Right  So we got to jump in there  And do something  And it's frightening  Coming from a guy  Who looks like he was arrested  For decapitating a woman  And whacking his bag into their shoes  Oh my God  Norton  You know, oddly  You're not the first person  To describe me that way  Why'd you have to help me?  That's okay  We're having a little side competition here  Me and Norton  So you put this side together  We put this side together  And my pal had run into a girl  Just like you described in college  And she actually practiced  That is that exact approach 
[01:55:30]  Because in his words  Because she wanted to be pure  Pure  Pure was the term he used  Sure  Mr. Berkowitz  How long have you had the side?  Oh my God  I'm sorry I wasn't listening  How long have you had the side?  How long has it been?  Oh it's about a year  A year?  Through up last October  We love the testimonials  We love the commercials  From the little girls  Talking about backdoor sex  Who's the girl in the commercial? 
[01:56:00]  That's an actress named  Melanie Martinez  She's pretty cute  Yeah she's pretty cute  Yeah  She's very talented  How old is she?  Wait what do you mean by  Very talented and a lot of nice?  Well you'll have to ask her about that  But actually  Actually I shouldn't give it away  But actually she's 29  Wow  29  Does she do porno?  She hasn't told us  She could be a star  In Barely Legal  Yeah  Yeah  Exactly  Giving orders  So now  You know we were having  A lot of fun with the site  Yesterday but 
[01:56:30]  I assume you guys  Made up the testimonials  Oh yeah  The oaths  And  Yeah because some of the  Some of the creative ideas  They made up the pledge too?  Yeah  The pledge  I thought the virgin pledge  Was the real deal  Hey  It is now  It is now  It's not real  Have you gotten letters  From girls  That think this is a good idea  That think it's a real deal site  I'd say about two thirds of the letters  Think it's real  Think it's real  Think it's real  They come in 
[01:57:00]  They say how could you be doing this  Right  Are you really proposing this  Do you really think this is a good idea  And the other third are going  You know this is what I've been doing my whole life  It's nice to see it validated on the web  Oh man  Had you always done web  I'm sorry I have to go  That's okay  No  Had you always done web stuff  Before doing clown paintings in Chicago  Or  Oh my god  Clown paintings in Chicago  No  I can't compete  No we basically did this  I do  This off the top of our heads  To figure out how to use the digital camera  We're working on  Some straight science fiction shorts 
[01:57:30]  Maybe get on  Sci-fi.com  Or Sci-fi channel  Stuff like that  What's the best way to quarter a dead hooker  Use a saw  Or something sharp  Is a quarter the price for a dead hooker  No  Just quarter them  He looks like a sci-fi guy though  You know what I mean  You got the sci-fi look  Oh yeah  Any other websites  No  That's it  That's it  We threw it up  We threw it up  Hey it was great  We threw it up in October  Just practice  Just to see how it was fun  Threw it up over a weekend  And you've had  We ignored it for a year  And then we started getting 
[01:58:00]  A million hits a month  Wow  And you've had no  No problem  Getting the name  Technical Virgin  No  Nobody had picked it up  No one had picked it up  And what really  Set it off  Is when Maxim picked us  As like one of the top  Five sites of the year  Ah Maxim  Did you actually come up  With the manifesto  Or pledge  I mean  Did you come up  With the pledge  Yeah I wrote the pledge  Myself  You're dying to sign up  I love it  It's a great site actually  Bill what's going on

[02:19:30]  That's where the joke  Is my friends  And by the way  Do you know  What you have to be  Packing to pull off  The thong trick  The thong  Yeah yeah  That what goes  Without saying  I mean this  The guy  Pulled the junk  From the front  You know how you do it  You pull it through  To the back  You pretend you're a girl  It's called pretend you're a girl  Or the bowl of fruit  They call it from the back view  It's the bowl of fruit  You do that  But you continue  With the main part  Of your junk  And pull it up  Through the crack  Like a thong  All the way up too 
[02:20:00]  All the way up  All the way up  He was doing that  He could have  Moosed his back hair  You know what happened  I think after working  Manipulating their junk  Like that for so long  Doing this show  It ends up like  Stretch Armstrong's leg  Remember the Stretch Armstrong toy  Right  It just seems like  They could pull that thing  To an elephant trunk  It's ridiculous  Like a pair of shoes  Right  Ah there you go  Pair of shoes  Psycho Tim wants in 
[02:20:30]  Tim what's up  This is a ringback  What Cali was saying  He's handing out  The signs of the back  Of the buses  But he's also handing out  These bigger signs  That are stickers  Oh really  Oh nice  And they're probably  I'd say they're  Three or four times  Bigger than the bus stickers  Wow  Yeah you know  They started something  In Boston  We wanted to advertise  A little bit  And put the  Wow  Opie and Anthony  All over buses  And billboards  And they found it offensive  So they made  WBCN take it all down  You just pissed off

[02:21:30]  From that  Oh yeah  Because that's illegal  And people would see that  And go hey  And they'd think of  Opie and Anthony  Something is illegal  Especially don't do it  To you know  Our old radio station  I was ready to call  It competition  But that's kind of silly  To say  I mean Opie  I would never do  Anything like that  Yeah don't do it  To our old radio station  We want to play fair  Hey what's going on  Alright Tim  Thank you  Alright guys  Huge day in Boston  As they give out  Those bus signs  To our  Yeah  Insane listeners  There you go  Hey let's talk about  A foosball table 
[02:22:00]  Anthony  Son of a bitch  Yeah  We've had this problem here  Can we talk to Ron and Fez  Are they in the building yet  For a while  I don't know if they're in yet  I hope they are  That douchebag producer  They got  Whatever the hell he is  I don't even want to  Call him a producer  Yes  I don't even know  What that is  He's like a glorified  Intern  Yes  Al Dix  Al Dukes  Al Dix  We have our  Foosball table here 
[02:22:30]  You were nice enough  To bring it in  From home  Anthony  You know  I just wanted to  Bring in a foosball table  I know a lot of people  Around here like foosball  And it's great  During some of the  Commercials  Or what not  We go out  And we play some foosball  And it's great  Great way to wind down  Al Dukes  For some reason  Got all pissed off  On Ron and Fez's show  One night  And  Kicked the foosball table  Over  I think he got pissed  Because a guy kissed him  And he kind of liked it  And he kind of liked it  And he enjoyed it 
[02:23:00]  The big flaming fag  That he is  And  He kicked the table over  Breaking it  The whole thing's not level  It's cracked  The surface  Which is supposed to be  Completely level  Surface like a wok  Now  On that thing  But  Surface like Afghanistan  After we bomb him  Right  You can only dream  Without the scattered  Monkey parts  Right  Dare to dream  Right  Makes the game more  Challenging though  Norton 
[02:23:30]  So for some reason  Gotta shoot around him  For some reason  Al Dukes  Has had this problem now  To toil over  For  I don't even know  How long it's been now  It's been quite a while  A couple of weeks  Do I fix the foosball table  That they have already  Or do I get a new one  The guy  He's brain dead  So I guess he decided  To have someone fix it  I don't know what the person did  Nothing  Because I came in that night  He said someone  Come up to fix it  Nothing was done  It still was broken 
[02:24:00]  So then  For some reason  I come in today  The foosball table  On it's side  In the main entrance  To where we come into  This building  Well that's because  Anthony  There was a new  Foosball table  It's played  Yeah  The new foosball table  Also in the lobby area  On it's side  So I hear  Hey  Earl comes back  Into the office  He goes  Hey  Did you see the new  Foosball table  I'm like  Oh  New foosball table  Let's go check it out  Let me check this out  Anthony was so excited 
[02:24:30]  It was like Christmas morning  Right  He sprinted down the hallway  I look at the old  I see the old foosball table  Up on it's side  On this  Wheels  On wheels  Like they just  Rolled it out  Like an old  Vending machine  You did that  Like Fred Flintstone  Thing  You were running  But your feet  Were barely on the ground  And you heard  Like the  Right  The drums  Yeah I was running  And smoke  Smoke  Actually smoke  And uh  I see the foosball table  There  So I'm like  Alright  Let me see the new one  I walk up  I don't even have to  Get around to see the front 
[02:25:00]  I see these big  Box like legs  That have no leveling capability  That's the first impression  I get  Then  I go around to the top  Now get this everybody  If you know anything  About foosball  Here's how it works  Uh  For every side  There's one goalie  In front of the goal  Then in front of that  There's  Two guys  That's your back  Then uh  One of uh  The opponents  Three men front  Then there's the 
[02:25:30]  Five man  Five man  At the center  At the center  And then the same thing  On the other side  The three man front  The key  One goalie  One goalie  And if it goes to the corner  Of the table  What happens  It's tipped up  It's angled up a little  So the ball will roll back down  Easily gotten by the single goalie  The single goalie  I look at this table  There's a  The back rod  That has the goalie on it  Three goalies  Three goalies  It's retard foosball  It's retard foosball  It's  It's like a baseball team 
[02:26:00]  With two extra players  On one side  Because you're retarded  Like  Like Al Dix  You're a retard  So I look at this  I go  Unacceptable  And who  Wait three  Decided  Three goalies  No tilt up in the corner  No tilt up in the corner  And uh  And cheap  Unleveling legs  Thick legs  And no bearings  Oh here's another thing  Plastic bushings  That the rods slide in  If you could call it sliding  Uh  As opposed to  The table I brought in  Bearings  Ball bearings 
[02:26:30]  Hold those things  So nice slide  Nice action  And  And  And I'm  I'm thinking  Who the hell  Decided to drag  Our table out of there  Without even letting us  First see the replacement table  So  So I am  Livid pissed  And we are joined now  By Ron and Fez  Who have to actually  Pay money  To this  Useless  Uh  Gentleman Al Dukes  How'd you like the new table  Can I  Can I jump in  Before Ron and Fez start  I want to make it 
[02:27:00]  Perfectly clear  We have  Absolutely  No problems with  I love Ron and Fez  That's my entertainment  On the way home  Love the guy  It's my entertainment  On the way home  I love  The Ron and Fez show  Very funny  They're on after us  In New York  Absolutely  And we listen  Every single night  On the way home  And the only thing  I could say  That could make the show  Better  Is getting rid of  That useless  Piece of crap  Al Dukes  Alright  Put it this way  We never hired the guy  Everything that we've  Ever been given  Always comes from Jeremy  No one ever lets us 
[02:27:30]  Bring in our own people  Oh he's one of Jeremy's  Number two  I used to eat  Asset like Tic Tacs  And never thought  It was a good idea  To break somebody else's property  Right  The guy had a few beers  Especially fun property  Right  Like it's  It's your fun property  I don't care if he wants  To break a toaster oven  Or something  We were all enjoying  The foosball table  All enjoying  Enjoying the foosball table  What annoys me  Is someone thinks  That terrorist attacks  Excuse their  Previous responsibilities  Right  Like the slate 
[02:28:00]  Got wiped clean  You know what  If Al Dukes  Was down there  With a helmet on  Digging through rubble  And helping out  God bless him  I'd put aside  The foosball table thing  Believe me  I would  But he's  This happens in New York  Everyone's devastated  It doesn't affect his job  Right  And his responsibilities  So you don't like  The foos  T-ball table  That he brought in  That thing  Was the  Extra goalies  Extra goalie people  Are missing their  Foosball table  Ron let's just put it  This way  The game came with 
[02:28:30]  Hockey helmets  For all of us  Hockey helmets  For the bus ride  To play  That's right  The short little bus ride  When am I  Anybody hurt  It's like  You know something  How do you buy  A foosball table  That you can't even level  We can only dream  That he'll bring in  Tomorrow a Barbie  Pinball machine  From Toys R Us  Oh Anthony  With the little  Plastic legs  Someone is challenging  Mike says  Three man back  Is actually  Professional foosball  Alright Mike  Guys what's going on  Alright  I'm not defending  Al Dukes  In any way  Explain to me  The three man goalie  Three man back  It's a tornado table 
[02:29:00]  Which I don't know  If it is  But tornado makes  The professional table  Professional table  Yeah  The professional table  It's not the bar table  The bar table is  You know  We want bar table  Thank you  I didn't  I didn't start my career  In professional foosball  I started it in a bar  It's a professional foosball table  It's tornado  If it's tornado table  I don't care about tournament  I don't  No  No  Piece of crap  Unleveled legs  You can't level the legs  How do you tell me Mike  Is it a tornado  I don't know  It should be pulled away  In a tornado  And thrown in a cow field 
[02:29:30]  That's all I know  About that  In a tornado  I don't want to defend him  But it is the pro table  The legs can't be leveled  Piece of crap  We play bar table foos  Bar table  Alright I agree  So do I  But I'm just letting you know  Alright  So now here is my proposition  Or not even proposition  My  If I may call  Demands  Demands  Okay  That I am making  Sure  Now I am not making them on you guys  You are simply a liaison  Right okay  Between this program  Ask them to fire them  No no no  Because you fire  I lose  I lose  Here is what he has to do 
[02:30:00]  No we win  He must  And here is  I am not being like George Bush  Not telling anybody  Right  When and where  Or anything  What is this  It is  26th  Okay I will give him  Till next week  He has one week  Till next  You are a softie  No  Too much  Hey hey  No no  Because you know something  There is plenty of time  For him to work  Whatever resources  He needs to work  There is a weekend in there  To help out  Whatever he needs there  One week  To secure 
[02:30:30]  And have  Submitted for my approval  Not installed  Submitted for my approval  Submitted for my approval  A foosball table  Of equal or greater quality  Than the one we started with  That is it  I want good foosball  Now he said if you turn this one upside down  You can play skittle pool  Which  And air hockey  Is fun  That air hockey is not working  No air  No air comes up 
[02:31:00]  No air comes up  What about skittle bowl  Skittle bowl  Skittle bowl  With the bowl  With the little pin  And you would throw it through the pins  But you couldn't throw it too hard  Or you were just yanking the pins down anyway  Did you bother to turn it over  Right  Turn it over and try it  If you take all the rods out  It makes a perfect table  To put a rock'em sock'em robot set on too  Which is good  Right  I might go for that  That's my demands  One week  You know I would fire him tonight  Yeah 
[02:31:30]  But I don't know if I can get it past Jeremy  Jeremy brought the guy in  And it's like having a narc on our show  Yeah  And every time we ask for something  Can I get that?  No  We can't  Oh my God  I go get me  I can't make long distance calls  It's  Oh my God  I'm like what?  What?  The company really frowns upon me  Right  I was  I got such enjoyment  The other night  When a girl called up  Yeah  Wanted to be an intern  You said  Do you go to college?  She said yes  Go okay  You got the job  You're in  And then you turned around to Al Dukes 
[02:32:00]  And went  You have been trying to get an intern for this show  For months  Right  And you have failed  We also have  You show on the show every night  Right  His complete and utter incompetence  They gave us  How many guys we have working with us?  Not one can do production  Yeah  And I go  I don't understand this  This is New York  They're producers  You know  That can't  So what do they do?  They're telling us great show  You guys rock  There you go 
[02:32:30]  I don't want your opinion  They're there to kiss your ass  Right  One of them came to me last night  And said  Feds what is this?  I said that's a CD  That is a CD  Oh  We're going to have to start at the basics  Yeah  You've got to train them  Opie I consider this your responsibility  It's your station  You are the assistant program director  Hire people  You're the assistant program director  Hire good people  How hard would it be?  I saw it  Because I can't get your producer fired  I tried  I'll be  You know something?  I'll be honest  And I hope he hears this right now 
[02:33:00]  I can get him fired  I can  I absolutely can get him fired  Don't test me  Is that what happens in one week?  Because I'll go to Jeremy  And I will get him fired  One week  I would love to say it  I won't tell the consequences  I give him the timeline  I give him when there will be consequences  And I give what I want in that week  But let me tell you  I can get him fired  The guy wants to defend the situation  It's a three man back  They're defending the three man back 
[02:33:30]  Jay  My first time on the Afro show  I love his balls  But don't get me wrong  Dukes is a douche  Alright  But man  The three man back  That's the way the tournaments are run  Everywhere you go  We're talking bar tournaments too  Bar  Bars  No  I have worked with the three man back for years  But I never played football  And you went to jail for it too  Didn't you?  You went to jail for it  Yeah  A little different  In Bama  Yes  Have you given it a shot?  Is it a tornado?  It is indeed a tornado  Oh man  Tell him you can give it to me  No 
[02:34:00]  I don't care  Trade it in  I want a bar table  Ninth caller?  Ninth caller  But I win  I don't want the tournament table  I don't care if it's diamond studded  And gold plated  I don't care  What kind did you have before?  Like it was one guy back  That's it?  Yeah  One guy in the goal back  And then you have the two man in front of him  That's your defense  It's bar foosball  Was it the circuits?  And I don't care how good it is  You know something?  A foosball table to me isn't that good 
[02:34:30]  When there's plastic bushings  Holding the rods in without bearings in it  So don't even try  It sucks  Oh man I'll take it  No you won't  Because he will be using that to bargain to get a good table  I don't care what he needs  What are the consequences?  A lot of people want to know  You're giving him a week  I'm giving  I didn't give any consequences  All I said was  I said that I'm sure I could talk to Jeremy  And have him removed  I'm not saying that is the consequence  But I can do it  The night that he broke it  I guess he was kicking it 
[02:35:00]  And pushing it over  Someone told me he was yelling  Dago, Dago  Dago, guinea wops  Yeah I heard all that stuff  Nice  And I don't know where it came from  Nah it's bad  That anger came from  Yeah I don't know where it came from  You know what else is broken on that  That we never even griped about  But it's an important part of the table  The little flip down drink holders  Yeah I noticed that  There were four  When I brought that in  There were four operational flip down drink holders  You flip the bottom down 
[02:35:30]  And flip up a little thing that holds the top of the bottle  Holds the Sam Adams  Nice  So now the Sam Adams  You pop it in there  You play a little  You drink a little  Right now  One of them actually works  The rest all snapped off and broken  From his turning the table over  And you don't get those with the Tornado brand  No  No  Because it's tournament  It's tournament  There's no drinking at the tournament  Right  Ooh perish the thought  The tournament you're drinking  I played foosball  Grew up playing foosball in bars  Just like everyone else  Sure  No one  No one got on that table  And said 
[02:36:00]  Hey where are the other two goalies  Did one person say that  No  No  I remember what we said  We said this is great  We were all excited  Yeah  It was like the orphanage got a toy finally  Exactly  And some ass wrecked it  Al Dukes ruined it  Well he's got one week  I think he's going to call your bluff though  I think you better be ready  Because he's a cheap man  He's a cheap man  I will start the wheels turning  Yeah  As per the consequences that I have 
[02:36:30]  And I know he didn't go out and buy this thing  I know it's some kind of trade out  But he expects  Yeah  To be doing it on our show  And why not  You know  It's a replacement of property from our show  Wouldn't you have us approve it first  Sure  And say look  Is this like what you're looking for  I'm just imagining now  20 foosball tables in the lobby area  Anthony  Before  He gets one that we want  I was there when they dropped it off  It was three guys  They dropped it and ran  Right  Really  Look where it was 
[02:37:00]  Like thieves in a knife  I know  No joke  It was barely in the door  I know  Yeah it was  Everybody  Blocking people  Everybody's dropped off a high school girl like that  Just threw it in the front yard  Hit the gas as hard as they could  Hey she got home  Hey I don't know  I dropped the roll  That's how they dropped the foosball table off  It's embarrassing  It's embarrassing  It's horrible  And I know  Like Ronnie you said  He's got some sort of plug  That we'll have to be on the lookout for tonight  When he tries to slip that in  See right  For Fred's cheap arcade  Sure
