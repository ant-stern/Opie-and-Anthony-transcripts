[00:00:00]  The virus. Sirius XM.  Hey, hey, hey!  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues.  This is After ONA Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  It's After Opie and Anthony Live.  Opie and Anthony are very much gone, as was evident by that last live read.  Sometimes things still need to get done, and there's nobody left here to do them.  So, that's when we pick up the slack.  We're still here. Me and E-Rock, Danny and Travis are around. 
[00:00:30]  I know Opie shouldn't have left.  He should have stayed. He performed very well yesterday.  He was walking out with Roland.  I guess Roland figured that today's guest went so well, he was going to pitch more,  because he was following Opie down the hall, which sometimes works well for Roland,  and sometimes does not.  We'll ask him when he gets in.  Hello, you're on After Opie and Anthony Live.  Hey, yeah, this is Bobo.  Yeah, what's up, Bobo? You're on the air.  I'm on the air live. 
[00:01:00]  This is a surprise to get on the air this quickly.  Well, why did you come in this show literally?  You could get off the air this quickly, too.  Ouch.  The show just started, Bobo.  So, can I put you on hold, and we'll get back to you?  Yeah, you guys asked me to call in.  All right, well, who asked you to call in?  Nobody did. We've been in here the whole time.  No, yesterday you did. You guys never talked to me.  I don't know. Well, yesterday was a busy show.  I'm going to put you on hold, and we'll get back to you, okay? 
[00:01:30]  All right.  All right. Bobo's going to stay on hold.  Yesterday was a busy show, but it was no show in comparison to today's.  How about Jesse James?  The streak is alive with excellent guests.  Jesse James was in here for like an hour and a half,  and it seems like he would have stayed all day if we would have let him.  It seems Ant made a new gun friend.  When that happens, you know it's going well.  Who else did that happen with?  The interview was moving, and it was kind of headed towards the end, 
[00:02:00]  and then something about guns comes up,  and it brings everything to a whole new light.  Who else was that?  I'm trying to think.  I think at one point Stone Cold.  Yeah, it was somebody before that, though.  The camaraderie that exists between gun owners is an amazing thing to see,  and we definitely saw it today.  Jesse James was a phenomenal guest.  His book, American Outlaw, is in stores now.  He's doing signings and everything.  His Twitter is freejessejames, so you can get all his signings and all that there. 
[00:02:30]  But we are going.  We're looking around the hall.  I'm trying to see if Roland is coming back yet.  He's obviously just taking up Opie's time in the lobby.  Yeah, he followed him down to the elevators.  Well, you should tell him to bring Opie back here, and from now on.  I did.  I asked him to come back, and he said he felt he was being overexposed.  Who did?  Oh, and that this show is cheapening his product.  Really?  Yeah.  Well, I'm not going to comment on that.  But what I'm trying to say is Roland should, I mean,  this whole part of this show is kind of featuring everything that goes on behind the scenes, right? 
[00:03:00]  I mean, that's the whole thing of bringing people in randomly  and letting everybody know what's going on.  That's why Bobo's on the phone anyway.  So why wouldn't Roland pitch his guests live on this show to Opie?  Because Opie decides he's walking towards the elevator,  and if Roland wants to get anything done, that's where he has to go.  Opie should stay in here.  What's up, Troy Kwan?  Is Bobo still on the phone?  Yeah.  No, he's not, is he?  No, he's on hold, yeah. 
[00:03:30]  Oh, he kept calling all morning.  Okay, let's get Bobo on the phone.  He was calling the O&A show?  Yeah.  Because you screened the calls for O&A.  Yeah, he was calling in and he'd go, this is Bobo.  And I was like, what's up, Bobo?  And then he would just hang up.  And he kept doing it all morning.  And I just asked Travis because I thought it was a goof or something.  Bobo, were you pranking Troy?  No, Troy, I think it was a conspiracy.  Oh, shit.  Why did you keep calling?  Bobo? 
[00:04:00]  Yeah, that was part of the, I'm telling you, I think it is a conspiracy because I wasn't  calling.  Oh, he's fucking with you, dude.  Bobo, Troy.  I'm an asshole.  Bobo's fucking with you.  Yeah.  How does that make you feel?  Like a dick?  No, I just didn't know what the hell was going on.  He's just sitting there poking and prodding at you.  Yeah, yeah.  The goof's on me.  Yeah, exactly.  That phone, you get very angry in that phone screening room.  I've seen you yell at a lot of people.  It's just a bombardment of fucking assholes. 
[00:04:30]  Is that what it is?  Just this one included.  And then you got this guy calling, hey, it's me, Bobo, and then hang up.  And then hang up, not saying anything.  Did it get you frustrated?  Yeah, absolutely.  It did.  Every time he's up here, I have to hear his voice.  I get frustrated.  Eric, you were in there with Troy today.  Did you know this was going on?  No, Troy didn't hit that peak where he overpowers the headphones as I'm listening to the show  today.  Well, like, you got the headphones on.  Yeah.  And he's yelling so that you can't.  Some of my favorite parts of Troy answering the phone is when he just yells out of nowhere  and goes, what's your fucking name? 
[00:05:00]  What gets you so upset, Troy?  Well, because they call in and they're like, I'm like, Opie and Anthony, what's your name?  Where are you calling from?  Yeah, tell fucking Anthony.  And I'm like, what's your name?  Sir, what's your name?  What is your name?  It never gets past that point before Troy starts profanity spewing towards the listener.  And they're just like, fuck him.  I'm like, you're going to fucking be kidding me.  Why don't you just wait patiently? 
[00:05:30]  Because the phone banks are lit.  And you're trying to move this thing along.  Because they're looking to see what's going on for content for the show.  I'm trying to get it to them as fast as I can.  And last night was DJ night, wasn't it?  Yeah.  So you're not going on much sleep.  Two hours.  So you're irritable.  No, I feel great, actually.  I really do.  I feel fine.  But you don't think it'd be easier for some asshole like Bobo to get under your skin based  on the fact that you haven't slept that much?  Sam, he gets under my skin every time I hear his fucking voice.  Because he's just annoying.  He's just annoying.  He needs a hobby is what he needs. 
[00:06:00]  This is it.  He needs a job.  He needs a life.  He kept calling me over the weekend.  On your cell?  Yeah.  Oh, God.  Because thanks to whoever gave him that.  He kept calling me.  I don't know.  He kept calling me because I guess he went up to Foxwoods.  Oh, I heard about this.  But he was there like amazingly early.  Like this was early afternoon.  And he just kept texting and leaving voicemails that they don't know anything about my ticket.  What are you doing about this?  Listen, Bobo, are you still there?  Yeah.  Somebody Facebook messaged a bunch of us on staff. 
[00:06:30]  And they said they had spoken to you at Foxwoods.  And it really sounded like it was you.  Number one, you said that if you told this person, he's just some fan that Facebook messaged us.  One of our lovely fans, but just a fan.  I don't remember his name.  You said that if you saw Danny, you were going to slap him in his face.  No, I did not say that.  What did you say to him? 
[00:07:00]  I don't remember saying that at all.  Well, would you have wanted to slap Danny in his face?  No.  Why not?  I would not, all right.  I would have said hi.  Okay.  So that's a lie.  Yeah, that's a lie.  Well, then tell me this.  Why were you also telling this person that you were working on a super secret Bobo Worst of with E-Rock?  I did not say that either.  I don't think that he made that thing up.  Bobo, that sounds exactly like something you would say. 
[00:07:30]  E-Rock, tell us more about the super secret Worst of Bobo that you're working on with Bobo.  That's news to me.  So Bobo was lying.  This is the first I'm hearing of it.  Bobo.  Who was this, all right?  Why are you telling people this stuff?  No, it was a friend of mine that never said anything like that about me before.  What?  So he did say it.  Who is this that said this?  Well, who did you tell it to? 
[00:08:00]  I don't know.  I was just talking to my friend Matt.  He just said he didn't say it.  Okay, now we know that you said it, Bobo.  So you also said the thing about slapping Danny.  You just said it to your friend, but you said it.  I never said anything about Danny.  That I never said.  But you said the Worst of thing.  Yeah, but I never said anything about Danny.  Okay, E-Rock.  Remember in the early days when we started having Bobo on regularly?  Those were dark days.  Listeners would tell us they would see him at like FH Riley's or comedy clubs or whatever,  and he would sit there and just lean over, even if they weren't talking to him, 
[00:08:30]  and he'd just go, I'm the famous Bobo from Opie and Anthony.  This is the same Bobo who thought he was famous because his neighbors recognized him.  His neighbors recognized him.  Think about that.  Somebody also just texted me that Bobo was at a comedy club or something  and had printouts of his photo that he just started to hand out to the crowd  and they had no idea who he was.  That's probably a lie.  Bobo, is that true?  That's probably a lie, right?  It's not a lie, is it? 
[00:09:00]  I was signing some photos.  He wrote his own printouts.  Where did you get photos, Bobo?  No, they were just pretty much photos that I took myself that was taken on a camera.  Is Mr. Maloonigan's involved in the photo?  No.  Troy, would you be interested in a Bobo photo?  Fuck no.  No.  Fuck no.  So, Bobo, we'll deal with the Danny thing at some point.  I'll get you to admit it, but...  I never said anything about that. 
[00:09:30]  E-Rock is saying that this Worst of featuring Bobo, that was a total fabrication.  All right.  That I might have misheard something, all right?  Misheard.  Yeah, but the thing about Danny, I never said...  Dreamt.  Listen, Bobo, until you can not make things up about the show,  I just got a note from, actually from, wow, actually from way up top,  from one of the presidents of this company. 
[00:10:00]  Are you serious?  Okay.  Until you can not lie and make things up about the show,  it's now become a liability issue.  We're going to have to ban you from the show until, you know...  No, no, no, come on.  No, we're going to have to.  Sorry, buddy.  How long?  How long?  Look, six months.  But I'll see if I can shorten it.  What, they suspended me for six months?  Yeah.  Sorry, buddy.  No, no, come on, come on.  Look, we'll work it out, Bobo. 
[00:10:30]  Good riddance, asshole.  Don't say that, Troy.  Everything will be fine, all right, Bobo?  They didn't really do that, all right?  I want proof.  I want to see...  All right, we'll send you something, buddy.  Get a hobby.  Don't...  A ridded statement.  Okay, I'll send you a ridded statement.  A ridded statement, all right?  All right.  See you later, Bobo.  Okay.  Hang up on Bobo.  Fuck.  That was about all I could take of Bobo today.  I have two things for you, Sam.  That better not be about him.  Okay, one, yeah, I did talk to him because he was annoying me in the office about doing  a Bobo or something just so he would leave.  Oh, so I just hung up on him and lied to him because I... 
[00:11:00]  At least he got rid of him.  Yeah, and the other thing is, I guess...  You guys are mean.  We found some other production that Derek made and just threw into the system.  Tease it, because I want to play something first.  Okay.  So this is new Derek production?  It involves...  I'm guessing it involves Bobo.  I've never seen this before, and I don't think we ever played this.  By the way, I like that Derek's just doing production now for this show.  I think that's funny, because he played something the other day.  Yeah, because he does stuff.  Because what he does is sometimes when he really likes production pieces and they fit in with  the show, he gives Opie a disc. 
[00:11:30]  Opie plays it.  We put it in the system.  When he just does something that's weird or for his own amusement, he just puts it right  in the system without telling anybody.  And so we find this stuff now.  So we're going to play a new D-Boy production piece.  But first, we were talking about grown babies.  Now, Troy, you're an adult baby, correct?  No.  That's weird.  I don't know where I got that from then.  I don't wear diapers.  I don't know.  I guess I've got misinformation then.  But are you sure, like, weekends or whatever?  No.  Okay. 
[00:12:00]  All right.  Well, I got misinformation then.  We were doing the baby fetish video today.  That's not the first related conversation we've had.  In 2008, back in the K-Rock days, we had a similar conversation.  Not terribly similar, but it was along the same lines.  It was themed, so we can play it, about diaper fetishes.  I know that the baby guy said it wasn't sexual or whatever.  The diaper fetish, well, the diaper fetish is.  So we're going to play Opie, Anthony, Jim, the whole gang of us relating to diaper fetishes right here on After Opie and Anthony Live. 
[00:12:30]  After Opie and Anthony Live.  Well, authorities say that he's got a fetish with diapers.  He allegedly wears them.  All right.  I just don't get this one at all.  Diapers.  Did you go in your diety?  He's called infantilism.  Yeah, remember we had the guy that was in diapers and he came on with the dominatrix? 
[00:13:00]  I sure do.  And we were told not to laugh at him.  Yeah.  Then he comes in dressed as old school baby.  Well, like, how do we not laugh at him?  You can't come in like old school baby with the big bonnet on him.  The bonnet.  He looked like the baby from The Little Rascals.  That was like, ah, go chase yourself.  Yeah, sure.  He was a big, fat guy in a diaper and the little, like, baby dress outfit and the bonnet. 
[00:13:30]  And the bonnet.  He was well over 250 pounds in an oversized diaper.  And he got changed, didn't he?  Yeah, he sure did.  The dominatrix changed him, like, laid him down on a little mat on the floor and he was kicking his little legs, his big fat legs.  He's like, I don't mind talking about this.  He was trying to be all serious and we're just laughing.  This is what I do as a release for a thing.  You're in a diaper.  Shut up.  No one's taking you seriously.  Danny, could you go back to that picture you found?  Adult baby pictures could be the funniest thing you can find on the internet. 
[00:14:00]  Just put in adult baby on Google, I guess.  Is there anything funnier than that?  Right there.  Look at this tool.  Can we get that up on O&A Radio?  And he's trying to bend his legs in that friggin' bow-legged baby stance.  Well, the bending of the legs is so, you know, mama could, you know, clean you up.  Oh, clean you up with a little baby wipe?  He's getting into the cleanup position.  What much love do you need?  Huh?  How much love do you need?  What happened in your youth? 
[00:14:30]  What was missing that drove you to that?  Fetishes suck.  Fetish, you're right.  Fetishes are awful.  They're just embarrassing for everybody.  Sorry, Jimmy.  They really are.  Jimmy's like, well.  I can't even disagree.  They're horrid.  You know something?  Even the most subtle thing that you might do while you're taking care of business for  yourself goes right out the window the moment of completion.  You're just like, ugh.  What you got to do with fetishes? 
[00:15:00]  I got to clean this up.  It looks all silly.  Throw teenage boy's sweat socks off your face.  What you got to do with fetishes is just you got to turn off your brain.  Because if you really start thinking about the situation you're in, it's just ridiculous.  Yeah.  It just looks silly.  You have to somehow just shut the brain off and then maybe you can get into it.  It feels stupid.  Look at this guy.  Oh, stop.  I want a montage of baby adult diaper pictures on O&A Radio. 
[00:15:30]  Did his parents send him out to work at three or something?  Like, that's the only way.  I missed my childhood.  Oh, God.  Look at this fat retard.  He's got like a little pacifier around his neck.  I swear to God.  A giant safety pin in the front.  What company makes the adult diapers, not the ones for the old ones, but this, old school 
[00:16:00]  diapers that look really big.  He looks like me.  He does not look like you.  Yeah, he kind of looks like Jerry.  He's much fatter, Jimmy.  He's fatter, but he looks the face.  You're svelte, Jim, now.  It's the face.  Yeah?  Oh, it's terrible.  You think he looks like you?  It's terrible.  Let's get back to this guy.  Find more adult diaper pictures, please.  Well, authorities say that he's got a fetish with diapers.  He allegedly wears them, and it's accused of showing them to young children. 
[00:16:30]  I know these guys got to be professional, but how are you not laughing as you're doing  this story?  Show them to young children.  Get a load of this, clown.  What an ass.  Why the seriousness?  Like it's a space shuttle launch.  Oh, my God.  Nappy guy.  Nappy guy.  Oh, nappy guy because he's taking a nap.  Well, it's taking a little nappy.  Nappy is a British diaper, I think.  That's the term for British diaper.  Is it?  Yeah.  How did you know that?  Who doesn't?  Right?  Common knowledge, eh?  Yeah. 
[00:17:00]  I bet it is.  In some sectors.  Certain circles.  Certain circles of nappy guy.  Should we give out this website, or should we wait to get all the goodness for ourselves  first?  I was just talking about diapers in England.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's a pay side, so I can't really get to anything too delicious on you.  Oh, damn.  I have the password.  Why am I just bashing Steve today?  You're not.  You're just doing impressions.  Because you know he's going to come in and go, oh, yes, you do.  Yes.  The password is. 
[00:17:30]  Yes.  Showing them to young children.  A neighborhood in Holiday knows all about this man known as Boy Diaper.  31 years old.  Boy Diaper?  Wow.  Oh, he's really gone for it.  The best part of that sentence is, everybody knows.  I mean, it might be okay if one or two people know.  Yeah.  I know your name is Boy Diaper, but when it gets to the point, everybody knows.  Aren't you Boy Diaper?  Well, he's the guy that Robin actually aced out for the job. 
[00:18:00]  Holiday knows all about this man known as Boy Diaper.  31-year-old Martin Bagness was charged in February with wearing a diaper and showing it  to kids.  Police know all about him.  In 1999, he was convicted for a similar crime, and he's on Utah's sex offender registry, where  his alias is Boy Diaper.  The February case happened on this street in Holiday, and he was charged with 11 counts  of lewdness involving a child.  He always had a big bag on him. 
[00:18:30]  Oh, okay.  I was sure we were going to have to dump that until she continued.  Whoa.  I don't know what kind of diapers he's using.  Do they make transparent ones?  Yeah.  On him with diapers in it, and then he would always, he would ask the kids if they wanted  to see his diapers, and then he would pull his pants down and his shirt up and show them  that he was wearing diapers.  Aw.  It's cute.  Aw.  Is that pedophile, though, or is he just... 
[00:19:00]  Exhibition.  Or not even sexual, but really trying to be a kid.  That's weird.  Yeah.  That's bizarre.  Yeah.  I want to find out where he works, and then we can make some more decisions, you know.  I think he's a lawyer.  Preying on the most innocent of victims.  Yesterday, Bagness was arrested after authorities say he came to this recreation center and exposed  the diaper he was wearing to children.  We're frustrated because we've made numerous arrests, numerous contacts with this man, and 
[00:19:30]  it seems that he's back out in the street.  The 31-year-old lives with his parents in holiday.  Of course he does.  His mother claims Bagness suffers from dyslexia and was a victim of bullying during school.  Oh, God damn it.  Shut up, you stupid enabling mother.  Smack him in the face.  And say, take that diaper off.  Dyslexia, and he was bullied.  Shut up.  Well, he's dyslexia.  Everything's backwards.  He's big, but he wears small person clothes.  He's wearing his little person's clothes. 
[00:20:00]  He's going backwards.  Stop it.  Yeah, he should be shot.  In school, she says he never recovered.  Maybe his happiest time was when he was a little child, and maybe that's why he's so  got this fixation on children.  Kill yourself with diapers.  Well, that's another problem.  That's a physical problem.  Maybe mommy shouldn't have been taking tennis lessons.  A little attention might have helped.  She says that the diapers are a physical problem, so she's trying to blame it on the fact that  perhaps he's incontinent and has to wear diapers. 
[00:20:30]  Yeah.  Because he's showing children, and it doesn't seem like he's wearing adult dieties.  Oh, that's another problem.  That's a physical problem.  But those living on Kentucky Avenue have no sympathy with his past.  They're upset.  Bagman still gets to walk the streets despite his rights.  Concerned citizen?  It's frustrating to see that the system doesn't work, you know, because he, it's only a matter  of time, you know, before someone else, and I don't know. 
[00:21:00]  He just grosses me out.  Grosses me out.  How would you feel if you were a mother?  Let's play devil's advocate for a minute.  All righty.  You do the best you can.  Yeah.  And your best work is being arrested at age 31 for wearing diapers and showing children.  How does that make you feel?  That's where your best efforts got, everyone.  What a monumental failure this woman is.  Yes.  She has failed at the easiest job ever.  I do believe she wasn't a good mommy. 
[00:21:30]  Just giving birth and making sure the kid has what he needs.  Because you couldn't raise a bigger goose egg.  And he lives at home.  It's not like, look, my son, the physicist, wears diapers.  Yeah.  He lives at home.  He's been arrested for showing his diapers to children, and he continues to do so.  She has to make his mac and cheese every day.  Exactly.  What was that last picture you had there, Danny?  Don't even attempt to say it was hot.  It was a girl? 
[00:22:00]  Now, hold on.  Don't even attempt to say it was hot.  The girl in the diety, it's not hot because it looks like it's used.  And there's like a pad around back or something.  But there's something, no, rip the diety off.  I'm undressing her with my eyes is what I'm doing.  It's boy shorts made out of diaper material.  Yeah.  It's not hot.  I agree it's not.  It's not hot.  I thank God the diaper fetish never grabbed a hold of me.  Oh, my God. 
[00:22:30]  Imagine how embarrassing that would be.  Do you want to say a fetish just lined up at my door because they know eventually I'll invite them in?  You're going to latch on to one?  They really do.  They're like birds.  I'm like an old man in the park, and fetishes are like little pigeons.  They just know that I'm going to drop bread eventually.  Sometimes I feed the birds.  I hope Jake will be by.  Is that his name?  I never thought certain things would grab me.  But lo and behold, it's late at night.  You're online.  You're rifling through your Rolodex, and boy, don't you find a video that just tickles your fancy a certain way. 
[00:23:00]  Oh, really?  What is that video, Jim?  I'm speaking in general.  Just in general.  Whatever, yeah.  So, you know, you'll indulge as you watch the video?  Yeah, maybe I'll try that.  Yeah.  Hmm.  The Boris afterwards?  Oh, okay.  Oh, it involves liquid?  Sometimes, sometimes not.  All right.  Mm-hmm.  It can be anything.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Yes, sir.  Yes, sir.  Mm-hmm. 
[00:23:30]  Mm-hmm.  You're a weirdo.  That's what it is.  After Opie and Anthony live.  That was kind of what we were talking about today with the baby, adult baby things, but  a little more diaper and sexual-centric.  From back in 2008, speaking of what we were talking about today, the video of that, you  know, the lip-syncing kid, Keenan Cahill. 
[00:24:00]  You probably don't know him by name, but he's the weirdo with the big head, the thick  glasses, and he lip-syncs everything on YouTube.  He was in here yesterday.  We got him on the after show.  You probably already know that, but the video of that is right now on Opie's YouTube.  That's YouTube slash Opie Radio.  Or you go to EROC Radio.  But that won't give you the video.  Oh.  So, you have no reason to.  So, the thing about it is, I want everybody to read the comments on that YouTube site. 
[00:24:30]  Roland, did you get a chance to read those comments?  I'm reading it right now.  So, this is an awesome video.  Great job, EROC.  Okay, you're at the wrong video.  That's one of EROC's videos.  I apologize.  I apologize.  One of EROC's videos.  Oh, here it is.  Cool that you put Mario Brothers at the end of the video.  Okay, that again is one of EROC's dumb videos.  Oh.  Where he put, yeah, Super Mario.  Eric, you shouldn't have.  The intros and outros on those videos you put are insane.  I'm still learning.  We got a phone call. 
[00:25:00]  After O&A, who's this?  Club Soda, Kenny.  What's up, Club Soda?  Did you see the video from yesterday's after show on Opie's YouTube?  Sam, didn't I text you to compliment you?  How great a job you did yesterday with the after show.  Yes, yes.  But it's not about me, Kenny.  What are you up to?  Well, I figured I'd call in.  I got to plug my friend Coke Logic is doing a show this weekend.  What do you mean a show?  I don't know.  Isn't he doing like a game show? 
[00:25:30]  He's hosting a game show?  Isn't he?  I don't know.  Like what?  Family Feud?  I don't know.  It's on the radio.  What channel?  Sirius 206 and XM 105.  Coke Logic is doing a show.  E-Rock, what are you programming?  That's new to me.  I think Coke Logic may have a segment on Big Kev's geek stuff.  I want to know.  I never watched that show. 
[00:26:00]  It's a radio show.  You just listen to it.  So you're plugging something that you don't know what you're plugging and you don't know  when it's on.  No, I just love Coke Logic.  Well, I mean, he's a good guy.  I like him, too.  By the way, how's the weather?  It's raining out in New York City.  How about elsewhere?  I'm not there.  Oh.  Can we get a traffic report?  I'm at a red light.  Okay.  Traffic moving along besides that? 
[00:26:30]  No, like in the rain, everything slows down in the city.  How about outside the city?  Any knowledge on that?  No, I'm suffering from lack of knowledge.  Okay.  Well, thank you, Kenny.  I heard you were on Facebook, by the way.  Yes.  Yes, I am.  But please beware of the imposter pages.  Beware.  It's dangerous.  Yeah, there's a lot of stupid people. 
[00:27:00]  Like, there's like 500-something on the imposter pages.  And, like, people are, like, happy.  Like, they're, like, number 524 on the imposter page.  Okay.  But meanwhile, they're the 524th stupid person.  Nice.  Nailed him.  Well, Kenny, good luck with your Facebook and getting home today.  Wait, is Kid Kelly all right?  He's fine.  I filled in for him yesterday.  He was just a little busy with all the channel change stuff.  Kid Kelly will be back on Hits 1 today. 
[00:27:30]  Yeah, it's very admirable, all the work you do on Sirius Hits 2.  Well, it's still called Sirius XM Hits 1, even though it's on Channel 2.  Yeah, whatever.  And please, please don't upset Troy anymore.  Troy Kwan on Facebook.  That was just, I mean, I'm not upsetting him.  You just wanted to squeeze in a plug for him because you have a little crush on him for whatever reason.  No, no, no.  He gets mad pussy now that he's a DJ.  I've only heard. 
[00:28:00]  I've only heard.  Yeah.  And I got to thank Eric for putting the thing on the Opie and Anthony Facebook page.  What is it?  About that, like, hashtag anti-social comedy.  Yeah, I understand.  Like, so fucking Twitter.  Do you just call in to thank people and plug people?  Yeah, people get so annoyed at me on Facebook because all I do is plug.  They want me to tell jokes.  People get so annoyed at you when you're on the radio because all you do is plug.  I mean, this is even worse. 
[00:28:30]  Not as annoyed as they do at you.  That's fair.  That's a fair statement, Kenny.  Yeah, they either love you or hate you.  Most hate, I think.  But that, you know what?  I think the haters are just a more vocal group.  I'm beloved by all.  That's debatable, but I'll appreciate that.  Thank you for calling in, Kenny.  All right.  Have a nice day anyway.  You too.  Thank you for taking my phone call.  My pleasure.  How much more time you got to kill to the end of the show? 
[00:29:00]  Bye, Kenny.  All right, I'm going to Tulling and Tulling now.  Nobody believes me.  Okay.  I believe you, buddy.  Bye.  Bye.  Kenny's right, though.  I was plugging Opie's video on Opie Radio on YouTube of the YouTube lip-syncing kid that  was in here yesterday, and people, there were a lot of comments that were like, oh, that  was funny, oh, that was great, blah, blah, blah.  They trashed you.  But there were a ton of comments going, Sam, you ruined the video by talking.  As if people don't realize that what we, we don't broadcast a video shoot in here. 
[00:29:30]  We video a radio show, and if I'm not talking while the song is playing, it's just a Kesha  song playing for three and a half minutes on the virus.  It wouldn't make a whole lot of sense.  That's because people are dumb.  They're very rude.  They're dumb.  They're stupid people who say that.  I agree.  You do.  You enjoyed it, didn't you, Roland?  I loved the little fella.  Well, thank you for helping book him. 
[00:30:00]  And those same people would be the ones complaining if I didn't talk and just let the Kesha song  play.  The same people who complain about everything.  Why do you have this?  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Go outside with a...  Speaking of complainers, Roland, we banned Bobo from the show for six months because he  lied on the phone.  Sweet Jesus.  Devoid just came in here and told me that, Derek, you know, he came in here and told me  that while that bit was playing before about the adult diaper, Iraq, I don't know if you're  aware of this, that Bobo has been calling the office phone. 
[00:30:30]  Did he call him or he called?  He called them.  He's calling Travis and Danny and Derek on the office phone on their business line and  complaining.  He admitted to lying.  He admitted that he did say the thing about Danny, but he's calling up and crying and  complaining that he doesn't want to be banned.  Bobo, if you're listening, you have to understand this came from above.  We, as the ONA staff, can't do much if you've become a liability that we let you in our home 
[00:31:00]  and then you go out there and lie to people about it.  There's nothing that we can do to save you right now.  We're going to try, but as it stands, if you're listening, Bobo, and don't call in because  you're banned from this show for the next six months.  It's all...  I got a note.  What can I do but read it?  Six months now.  What did I say?  I thought you said four before.  The note, I'm looking at the note, it says...  Let's go with six.  Six is what it says.  Four is a very straight number.  This is a round number.  It's six.  Now, E-Rock, we were talking about Derek. 
[00:31:30]  You said, like we said before the bit play, Derek, he makes production for the show.  He makes all the long-form production pieces that we play that you hear all of our voices  in.  Danny does a bunch, blah, blah, blah.  Derek is the one who produces these things.  Now, Derek, when he just does something randomly for his own enjoyment, instead of giving it  to Opie so he plays it first, he just throws it in the system and sees if anybody notices.  And E-Rock, you were telling me that you found... 
[00:32:00]  We did...  That's the way it worked with...  What's it?  Paul Reiser Breaks.  Yeah.  Yeah, the bit was called Paul Reiser Breaks.  It's been played on ONA since we played it here.  Yeah.  But we like to find things and debut them on After ONA Live.  Yeah, this piece...  I mean, for playing this, by the way, I'm sure we'll get accused of hoarding content.  And if we didn't play it...  No, you'll get accused of hoarding content.  And if I hadn't played it, I would get accused of not playing anything.  So you know what we're going to do, Eric?  We're going to play something.  We're going to worry about entertaining the audience, and we're going to play this new 
[00:32:30]  mystery production piece that Derek decided to just kind of throw in the system.  What's it called?  Yeah, this piece is called Bobo's Dick Breaks.  And is it Breaks with a Z again?  Oh, yes it is.  Derek is going to make a mixtape with all these.  All right.  Bobo Dick Breaks on After ONA Live.  Listen in.  My dick, my dick, my tiny little dick.  I've never got a lead because of my tiny little dick.  It goes up with no problem. 
[00:33:00]  All you need to do is show your tits.  My dick, my dick, my dick, my tiny little dick.  I've never got a lead because of my tiny little dick.  It goes up with no problem.  All you need to do is show your tits.  My dick.  All right.  I'll just go for the part.  My dick, my dick, my tiny little dick.  I've never got a lead because of my tiny little dick. 
[00:33:30]  It goes up with no problem.  All you need to do is show your tits.  My dick.  All right.  That's the song.  That's really good, Bobo.  Yeah.  My dick.  I know.  That's the song.  I guess I'll just try to.  Yeah.  You know what?  While I was listening to it, I was like, this doesn't really work because it's not in time  with any of the music.  Nope.  But it completely won me over.  Those little breaks in between. 
[00:34:00]  All right.  I'm just going to sing the song.  What did you think, Roland?  You're not laughing like I'm laughing.  I'm not a big fan of Bobo's.  You are in the Troy bandwagon of Bobo Stinks.  Yeah.  It's like, okay.  I mean, his production is hilarious.  I mean, it's good.  The song itself you enjoy.  What he did was great.  I just don't like Bobo.  You don't like Bobo itself.  Well, I'm sure that something that we did today will bother someone and we'll hear about  it later.  But to all the rest of you, the vast majority who enjoyed it as much as I did, we'll see 
[00:34:30]  you tomorrow.  Oh, Thor.  Eric and I saw it.  It was awesome.  That would be a talking point that I would discuss if I wasn't closing the show.  Tomorrow.  Tomorrow we will discuss Thor because it still won't have been out yet.  That's awesome.  Right here on After Opie and Anthony Alive.  A hammer?  And then we'll keep.  Hit it, E-Roc.
