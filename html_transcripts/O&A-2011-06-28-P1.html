<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show opened with Larry King's introductory remarks, followed by a discussion amongst Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton about Opie's father's sleep apnea mouthpiece, leading to humorous banter about its discomfort and potential awkwardness.  A caller, TJ, shared his own experience with a similar device.  The hosts then expressed considerable frustration with their upcoming meeting with their boss, Scott ("Blatter"), detailing their plan to abruptly leave if he raised his voice, belittled them, or offered a handshake.  This stemmed from perceived unfair treatment, broken promises regarding staff issues (particularly interns and raises), and resentment over their situation compared to other radio personalities like Howard Stern.  Their dislike extended to Russell Brand, whom they felt betrayed them after his success.  Other celebrities like Blagojevich (Norton had a picture with him), Jamie Foxx, and Louis C.K. were also discussed.  The conversation then shifted to the Tracy Morgan controversy, with Norton recounting a discussion with a gay friend about the comedian's jokes and differing interpretations of their offensiveness.  This led to a broader discussion about offensive comedy and hecklers in comedy clubs.  The show concluded this segment by discussing Linda Hogan and previewing an upcoming interview with her, including a clip of her discussing her relationship with Hulk Hogan and the Ultimate Warrior.

The next segment focused on a Supreme Court decision regarding violent video games.  Opie and Anthony debated the ruling, touching upon freedom of speech, parental rights, and the potential impact of violent video games on children, comparing them to pornography and violent cartoons.  The discussion included tangents about Doc Gooden's physical appearance, the lack of children in their neighborhoods, CNN's outdated video game footage in news reports, Bristol Palin's alleged plastic surgery, Nancy Grace's commentary on the Casey Anthony case, a clip from a 1997 Bob Kelly movie, a "This Day in O&A History" segment about a bet involving Eric Nagel, their upcoming meeting, and Bert the Conqueror’s recent appearance on David Letterman. Bert the Conqueror was a guest in the studio during this portion of the show.

Bert Kreischer then joined the show, recounting numerous wild anecdotes, including being named Rolling Stone's number one party animal, accidentally attending a Russian class instead of Spanish, partying with the Russian mob and participating in a train robbery in Russia, being the first person to do the Vegas Sky Jump, a near-rape encounter with Will Smith, and taking acid at Disneyland.  He discussed his TV show, *Bert the Conqueror*, his career trajectory with Jay Mohr’s help, and his transition to stand-up comedy.  Henry Winkler ("The Fonz") then joined the show, discussing his career and new book, *I Never Met an Idiot on the River*, along with Kreischer's show and the *Happy Days* character Fonzie. The hosts briefly mentioned the upcoming Linda Hogan interview.

Henry Winkler remained in studio as the discussion shifted to a long-standing desire from Bert Kreischer to be on the show. The hosts discussed Kreischer’s past failed attempts and Opie’s perceived dislike for Kreischer, hinting at Howard Stern's possible influence.  They discussed their mutual friend, Justin, who facilitated Kreischer's appearance.  Linda Hogan then joined for an interview, discussing her book detailing her marriage to Hulk Hogan, including his alleged infidelities, physical abuse, and the emotional toll.  She described his multiple affairs, use of multiple cell phones, and instances of physical aggression. She discussed the high mortality rate among wrestlers, attributing it to their lifestyle and medication use. She also spoke about her subsequent relationship, her children's reactions, and Brooke Hogan's discovery of her father's affair with her friend.  Linda promoted her book, "Wrestling the Hulk," and discussed Hogan’s business acumen and wrestling attire design, which she claimed was her idea.  A caller, a self-described Hulkamaniac, briefly participated. The conversation included humorous moments, such as the anecdote about Linda and Hulk Hogan melting a sex tape on a barbecue.  The segment concluded with Linda Hogan promoting her book signing. The interview included several sexually explicit comments and discussions of sexual topics.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Hi, this is Larry King welcoming you to the Opie and Anthony show right here on Sirius XM Satellite Radio.  What the hell am I doing here?  Isn't it brilliant?  Forget it. The thing's out of control. Out of control.  Great guests, interesting interviews, and of course, your phone calls as well.  It gets my nipples hard, you know what I mean, son?  Are you out of your mind?  It's not the most talked about, not the most written about, and certainly not the most listened to show in the history of radio, but I'm still proud to answer it.  Oh, you're going to have a ball. 
[00:00:30]  Yeah, you're good.  America's most trusted name in news, the Opie and Anthony radio show.  Let's welcome our hosts, Opie and Anthony.  By the way, who's Jim Norton?  Ah, good morning.  Morning, everybody.  Opie and Anthony, Jim Norton, ready to broadcast.  How's everyone? 
[00:01:00]  Good.  Dandy.  I feel lovely.  I have a sleepy time in a hotel.  You feel lovely?  I do, yeah.  Why?  I have like four hours.  That's a long night for me.  When I have four hours of sleep, that is a long night of sleep.  That's a nap for me.  Yeah, I can't get any more than, my father has some thing that he left me a message about.  He puts in his mouth, pause, of course.  All right. 
[00:01:30]  We'll end it right there.  And he said that it's going to change my opinion of him.  No, it's supposed to be it helps you sleep with apnea.  Really?  Dentists make it.  So I don't know if, maybe somebody knows what it is.  But it's not, he wears a mask now for apnea.  Is that one of those mouthpiece things that kind of, like, offset your jaw?  I don't know.  Could they say, like, if you offset your jaw, you could breathe better?  Opening up the passages?  I would like to know.  He said, do you have a dentist make it for you?  You don't have to wear a mask.  Do you grind your teeth at night?  I don't know. 
[00:02:00]  I don't think so.  I should if I don't.  I used to know a girl in college, she would grind her teeth.  She had little nubs on a beautiful face, too.  I was like, what are you doing?  You're wearing your teeth away.  You're only 19, 20 years old.  Nighttime teeth grinding sounds like nothing that a human should make.  Yeah.  It's like, hurt, hurt, hurt.  Oh, I've never heard it.  Oh, it's crazy.  Oh, really?  Yeah, I've heard it.  Well, should I get the flow chart out so I can tell you why I think that is?  Oh, wait a minute.  Yeah, let's say what the nighttime teeth grinding is. 
[00:02:30]  Molestation.  Yes, it has to be.  What?  The sex man uses a mouthpiece?  I haven't heard about this.  You sure it's not called a bit?  What do you mean you use a mouthpiece to sleep at night?  Meh, a mouthpiece.  After doing the sleep study, I went to the dentist, and they do that mold inside your mouth  so that it custom fits both your upper and lower jaw.  And then when you sleep, it kind of puts your jaw like this so it's uneven and prevents you 
[00:03:00]  from choking and snoring while you sleep.  Does it?  Dying in your sleeve.  Sounds romantic.  How does it feel, though, in your mouth?  After the first couple of days, you don't even notice it anymore.  Well, the problem is getting past the first couple of days.  How big is the mold?  You barely feel it.  It's so airtight to your jaw that you don't even feel it.  Give it a try, Jimmy.  I don't know, man.  It seems like it would be too uncomfortable.  It's actually better to get that than have to wear the machine. 
[00:03:30]  Why?  Because the machine you've got to plug in.  It goes around in your mouth and over your face.  Because it makes noise.  All right.  Yeah, we all know why.  But, I mean, the real reason is you'll never have sex again if you have to sleep with a machine.  With a mask.  Oh, does it go in your mouth?  Night, honey!  Can you eat with the mouthpiece in?  No.  All right.  Just asking.  I'm sure if it's meant to make you sleep better, it's not going to be uncomfortable. 
[00:04:00]  I don't know.  Because that would kind of really ruin their business.  Right.  Yeah.  Thanks, doll.  I'm a very bad...  Any type of distraction, I can't sleep.  Any type of...  It's so odd.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to TJ and Ron Karkama.  He's got the mouthpiece.  Oh, okay.  Nah.  TJ.  Jimmy.  Hi, TJ.  This is...  This is...  Help Jim Norton.  Yesterday it was cars.  Today it's...  Let's get them to sleep better.  This is the way to me.  Sleepy.  By the way, can I...  Can I say how great the listeners are? 
[00:04:30]  It's like when you ask a question, a legitimate question, I probably got 70 emails.  I noticed your pleasant way to tell them to shut the fuck up.  Thank you.  I've got plenty of responses.  Well, yeah.  And I want to thank the listeners.  In other words, all right.  All right, already.  Enough of you.  Well, I don't think you're going to send your email in the first five minutes.  I already got the info.  Yeah.  Don't worry about it.  They hear us on replay, so they...  You know, 10 o'clock at night.  I'm sorry, TJ.  Go right ahead.  Help Jim Norton.  Those people don't matter.  The people that matter are the ones listening to us live.  Who knows?  Who knows? 
[00:05:00]  Fucking Stephen B...  Bumor.  What?  Stephen Bumor.  Who BMW is named after.  May have actually heard me late.  Why?  I don't want to say BMW.  So I said Bumor.  Bumor.  What do you got, TJ?  All right.  I have the oral piece.  It's two pieces that goes in your mouth, and it keeps your mouth opened while you're sleeping.  So it allows more airing, because they say I have apnea.  They were going to give me the mask.  I tried to sleep, but it's impossible.  TJ, did your... 
[00:05:30]  All right, all right, all right, all right.  TJ, did your breath get a lot worse?  No.  Sleeping with your mouth open all night?  No, you actually...  Your jaw bothers you for the first couple of times, they say, and then what happens is  you get dry mouth sometimes, but then your body starts to, you know, acclimate to it.  Is that the mouthpiece or a blowjob?  What are you talking about?  Both.  Both.  Your jaw hurts first.  Yeah, and all of a sudden, your glasses are in the toilet.  Oh, well, well. 
[00:06:00]  You're silly.  I've heard of that part.  Jimmy's going to get a mouthpiece.  Thank you.  I'm debating it.  But I have to go out and fit it.  I don't want to do that shit.  I just want to buy, like, a bunch of...  No, no, it's pretty easy.  It's pretty easy.  You go for a little sleep therapy.  They do you without it, and then they make the piece for you, and then you go back and...  I can't do sleep therapy, sir.  Can you pick up chicks at sleep therapy?  Oh, you don't even know, man.  I always wondered that.  It's a big no.  Everybody's fucking groggy and sunken-eyed.  And you're all wired up. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah, morning breath.  I wonder if you could pick up chicks.  Dude, did you have...  E-Rock can...  With all those wires on your head.  Yeah.  Oh, that's the problem, dude.  I would have to piss.  You have to get up with all those wires on you and piss.  Sleep therapy is bullshit, because you go there, they wire you up and stuff, and it's so uncomfortable  to sleep that you don't sleep, and then they go, yep, you have a sleep problem.  But you can do it at your house, too.  With all the wires?  Yeah.  I took my apnea test, and I wake up, and I go, dude, it's too hot in here.  He's like, oh, okay, I'll turn it on the air.  And they turn it on the air, and it was too cold. 
[00:07:00]  And then I wake up in the morning, and they take off my stuff.  I go the following week, and they said, oh, yeah, you have apnea.  I said, well, I couldn't sleep.  It was either hot or cold, you know.  And how do you know if I'm not breathing?  Oh, well, you stopped breathing 160 times a minute.  I'd be dead.  160 times a minute?  I would say not a minute, sir.  Probably an hour.  Yeah, that's...  I don't know why I said I think I'm Dr. Norton correcting TJ.  Oh, true.  No one stopped.  I don't breathe 160 times a minute.  Yeah.  Maybe when I'm looking at salty photos.  That wouldn't mean you stop breathing... 
[00:07:30]  Almost three times a second.  ...two and a half to 2.7 times every second.  All right.  Well, you know what?  We're just trying to stop your pattern of lies, sir.  Yes.  Because he's told a lot of people that he stopped breathing three times a minute, and they all  look at you uncomfortably.  All right.  They don't call you on it.  Just close your eyes and go to sleep.  Enough already with the sleep studies and all the crap.  Those things look like chattery teeth.  Like toy chattery teeth. 
[00:08:00]  That you pop in there to offset your jaw?  Yeah.  That's weird.  Yeah.  I saw it sticks out a little...  Yeah.  They're like waxing.  It should be in a monkey's mouth as he claps cymbals together.  Hey, E-Rock.  Oh, come on.  E-Rock, have you smelled yours in the morning?  No.  It does...  I have, but it doesn't smell.  But sometimes...  It does smell.  You just don't know your own smell.  No.  Whatever.  It doesn't smell, but it has a...  Oh.  I'll mark that down, tubby.  A little PA. 
[00:08:30]  Payback's going to be a motherfucker.  That was a little PA.  I'll mark that fucking down.  You're going to be in a world of hurt.  Go ahead, stupid.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  You're better.  Early bird gets the word.  It doesn't...  A mouthpiece that you have in your mouth night after night doesn't smell.  Yeah, okay.  You wash it every morning when you take it out, but sometimes...  When you take it off, sometimes it's covered in, like, in phlegm and white stuff from your  saliva.  God!  Yeah, that doesn't smell. 
[00:09:00]  You should bring it in...  Even after you scrub it in a sink.  Yeah.  You should bring it in and make people smell it.  Boil it in water and make chowder.  Egg drop soup.  Oh, my God.  Some bisque.  Yes.  Blago's facing 300 years?  Yeah, Jimmy comes in and goes, you think he's going to go to jail?  Yes, he's going to jail.  He'll see some time.  I just looked down as we were talking and realized he's facing 300 years.  Blago.  He should have kept his mouth shut.  Yeah, it comes off... 
[00:09:30]  He comes off a lot worse when he talks.  Jesus.  He's a strange bird.  Really strange bird.  Yeah.  He's a governor.  They're all weird.  He was...  Governor.  When I met him going into Fallon, I guess that's a couple summers ago now, he was just  hanging out on the sidewalk hoping to be recognized.  Waiting for people to talk to him.  I watched it go down.  There was no reason for him to be on the sidewalk.  And he's kind of moving his head around like, yeah, that's right, that's me.  So I took the bait and said, fuck it, I'll get a picture with you.  I'll get a picture with a criminal. 
[00:10:00]  With a future felon facing 300 years.  Yeah, but I was waiting for someone, so I'm sitting around.  Well, I was trying to be recognized, too.  Yeah, a bunch of people standing around.  Hey, who are you?  I was a kid star.  There it is.  Me.  Yeah, that's nice.  Me and Blagojevich.  Blago.  I should retweet that today.  I don't even know where that fucking picture is.  It's much easier to just call him Blago.  Blago.  It's on your Facebook.  Oh, it is on my Facebook.  That's right.  It's a little blurry.  Yeah, it's right outside of NBC.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, Jimmy.  Wow. 
[00:10:30]  Sorry, Jimmy.  That's how I get catty, huh?  Oh, sorry.  I really thought the white balance is a little off.  Jimmy's on Team E-Rock today, huh?  Wow.  Oh, boy.  I'll mark that shit down.  Oh, boy.  Look, let me just.  Who's that guy?  Hey, look, that's the Greek.  Huh?  You remember in the wire when they had the photo of the Greek,  but he was walking past in the picture,  and that's the guy walking past.  That's obscure.  I know.  I just thought it out.  I'll play my card.  I'm in a bad mood already because I know I got to meet with the boss today.  Oh, no. 
[00:11:00]  We avoided the meeting with the big boss for how long now?  Months.  That was today?  And today we got to meet.  We have to do this meeting today.  And it's going to be one of these, you know,  I just want to sit down and see where you're at.  But by the end of it, he'll be yelling at us.  See, I didn't know that was today.  He raises his voice once.  I have a haircut.  That's fine.  I got my haircut.  Look, see.  I'm kidding, of course.  This guy raises his voice once.  I'm walking.  I'm telling you right now, Ian.  I'm not putting up with any bullshit on this guy.  Please, I hope he raises his voice within the first minute of the meeting. 
[00:11:30]  So that's why I'm a little on edge, and I'm ready to attack today.  Oh, boy.  We have to do one of these fucking meetings today.  Stand down, Ian.  And what can I do for you guys?  Know what I'm going to say?  Nothing.  Just nothing.  That's going to be my new tact.  We're fine.  And he'll go, what?  Nothing bothering you?  He'll belittle me.  I'm like, no, nothing.  Everything's fine.  Everything's good.  You need anything?  No.  And if he belittles me, I leave, too.  What would be considered?  You said I'm Francis from Stripes. 
[00:12:00]  Any of you homos belittle me.  Right.  I'll kill you.  I'll kill you.  If he belittles, I leave.  He raises his voice, I leave.  You homos.  He brings up the wireless mics in Times Square.  I leave.  What would you consider a belittling?  Everything all right with you today?  Because, you know, I'm edgy, and I'm always uptight, and, like, you know, God forbid I fight  for the fucking show.  Hey, what's the matter?  Hey, hey, hey.  Like, he'll come up to shake your hand and be like, hey, what's up?  No handshakes.  What's the matter?  He tries to shake my hand.  I leave.  I kill you. 
[00:12:30]  And always shakes his hand.  I always turn my body, because I learned that in semantics when I was in college.  I just turn my body quickly, and then he can't shake my hand.  See, you know what I do, though?  Stink finger.  Good for you.  Yeah.  You've got to rub your crack and your bunghole, and then when you shake the hand, you rub the  finger on his palm.  Yeah.  And all day long.  He's like, what is this?  No reason to make believe we're pals.  There's no reason for that.  With a handshake?  None of that crap is going down.  And how long can we anticipate this bad mood for the meeting with the boss? 
[00:13:00]  Well, we didn't even have it, and I'll be in a bad mood until 10.  And then the meeting.  Even if it's a good meeting, I'll be fucking off the rails until at least one.  Yeah, this is the truth, by the way.  Wow.  This is no radio bed.  And if it's a bad meeting where I have to walk, then fuck, stay out of my way until Wednesday.  Like Wednesday.  Which is tomorrow, right?  All right, that's not too bad.  And that's my new tack.  No, everything's fine.  It's good. 
[00:13:30]  Everything's fine.  I'll give him the laundry list, and he'll look at Blatter and go, oh, let's get on that.  Let's get on that.  All the stuff we said last time that hasn't been done.  And all that really does is protract our meeting.  Right.  So we might as well just go, no, everything's cool.  I'm going to just say everything's cool.  This is my new strategy.  That's good.  I like that.  I like that.  I'm going to go along with that.  Because I said last time the staff needs raises, oh, and he went right to Blatter.  Get on that.  Well, that was months ago, and nothing happened there.  Tell him the staff needs raises.  He gave more stilts. 
[00:14:00]  Hey, Vinnie Boombaz.  I go, can we get our interns back?  And he looked over at Blatter.  What's going on with that Blatter?  Explained.  He goes, oh, my God.  Let's take care of that immediately.  That was months ago.  So guess what?  Today, everything's fine.  It is like Blatter's almost like the American embassy guy.  Yeah.  Scott's like the terrorist hostage taker.  We're the hostages.  So he's like, you know, what do they need?  What do they need?  And Scott's just, oh, yeah, well, anything they need. 
[00:14:30]  We got it.  And we're just sitting there going, don't talk, because he'll beat us after Blatter leaves.  He'll just beat the bottoms of our feet with bamboo.  No.  A raised voice.  You go home today.  You go home today.  Raised voice, any negativity, any belittlement, a handshake.  Those are all reasons I will walk today.  Out.  This guy doesn't even understand.  Most of this place doesn't like him.  Wow.  That's what I thought it was attacked on his part.  He's oblivious.  I don't think people like hearing that.  What?  I don't think people like hearing that they're not liked. 
[00:15:00]  Well, he doesn't listen to the channel.  He has no fucking idea what we do.  I mean, really.  We could take him as an example.  Oh, E-Rock.  Wow.  How many times have we pounded on you today?  I haven't pounded on young Eric at all.  In five minutes.  Oh, you're dead.  You made a horse remark.  Oh, I did.  Yeah, remember the bit?  And then I said his mouthpiece smelled.  Meaning that he's fat like a horse.  Yeah, and his mouthpiece smelled.  Yeah.  You can make bisque out of it.  And I'm looking at his hair, and I sense an attack coming. 
[00:15:30]  Oh, and if he says you got to stop bitching about the company, I leave.  Oh.  Because I gave solutions to the problems.  That's a leave, too?  Oh, absolutely.  Nice list.  Most likely, Ant, I will be leaving within two minutes of this meeting, which will cause  a world of hurt for everybody around us.  Thank God.  Because then Bob will have to get involved.  He'll probably have to take a flight from L.A. to calm everyone down.  Oh, guys, you know, the meeting with Scott, I said, you really can't die. 
[00:16:00]  You gotta, I have to, oh my God.  It's tough to meet with a guy when you know that the guy fucking ripped you off.  Simple as that.  And I've said that to him.  So it's really tough.  I mean, it's much better.  Let us do our, look, see, I'm out of my mind.  This is what happens.  He goes, no.  This is what happens.  If, look, I'm out of my mind.  I'm out of my fucking mind.  Yeah.  I gotta calm down.  This is what happens, Ant.  At least I'm admitting it after all these years.  I know.  A chemical was released in my body and I'm out of my fucking mind now.  See, we should just do our show and you do whatever you do. 
[00:16:30]  Leave them again.  And we don't need to meet each other.  There's no reason.  We've been here over two years.  You've done nothing for our show.  So stop making believe you're trying to work this show because you're not.  I think the cute guys.  We do a great job every day and you do whatever you do.  I don't know what you do.  You might be the greatest fucking programmer in the world.  I have no idea.  But we don't need to meet anymore.  It is what it is.  You ripped us off and we continued doing our radio show.  We have liaisons.  We have like intermediaries. 
[00:17:00]  I can't meet now.  Is that done?  You're done, right?  Yeah.  I can't.  I hear you.  What do I write?  Bob?  Bill Tetley.  Bill Tetley.  Why can't the cute guys meet and then give us the info?  That asshole.  You got me going.  One of the assholes.  Now they're assholes.  Oh, I thought they were cute guys.  He goes to me.  It's good for you to meet with him.  I'm like, no, it's not.  That's why I don't respect you either.  How is it good for me to meet with the guy that pisses me off the most in my entire life?  How is that good?  He goes, it's good to just sit down with him. 
[00:17:30]  How is it good?  He doesn't even listen to us.  Oh, God.  Can I go home now?  I don't think I can do the rest of the show.  No, because now the chemical really got released.  It just squirted like an atomizer.  All over your brain, like a perfume bottle.  Oh.  Sorry.  Any wab?  What?  Hey, man.  Good.  Hey, man.  They want real radio.  This is it.  This is, you know. 
[00:18:00]  And I bring it up because a lot of people are in our position, my position.  I'll speak for myself.  They have just horrible bosses.  That's why that movie is going to do great.  Even though I'm supposed to see a screening of it.  There's more screenings available.  I'm going to try to avoid mentioning that it's Throw Mama from the Train and a Hitchcock movie.  Is that what you think that is?  Conceptually, sure.  You kill my boss, I kill yours.  You kill my mother, I kill your whatever.  And Hitchcock.  I think they acknowledged it, though, in Throw Mama from the Train.  They did a Throw Mama from the Train.  Oh, they did? 
[00:18:30]  Okay.  Yeah, they talked about it a little bit with Fox there.  Oh, there you go.  Another guy that's overpaid, you know, and does no radio.  But we're here every fucking day.  My favorite part of Throw Mama from the Train is when Danny DeVito goes,  It'll get ruined.  It'll get ruined.  He can't say ruined.  He said it'll get ruined.  Ruined.  Which is based on a Hitchcock film.  That's how Norton said that, too, though.  Not you, you know.  No, I say ruined because I have wonderful enunciation.  Yeah, Jamie Foxx talks about the whole Throw Mama.  Well, when they're having a discussion about it in this bar. 
[00:19:00]  I forgot he was in it.  I like the movie, man.  I'll see it.  As far as the mainstream comedy goes, I think they did all right, man.  I think they did really, really well.  Holy shit, Anthony.  God damn it.  I'm hearing you.  Believe me, I am right with you on this one because I have no want or need to sit in that office.  No, he proved himself for the last two years.  He's done nothing for us.  So why do we have to continue doing this?  Why?  The meeting is the same meeting and the same result, which is no result. 
[00:19:30]  Right.  Ant sits there, calm as a cucumber, and I'm sitting there seething under my fucking breath,  and I'm just trying to hang on for dear life before I say something really stupid.  You make Casey Anthony faces when she's sitting in testimony.  It's just like, ah, ah, ah, ah, because I see right through him.  Yeah.  God!  How do we get out of this?  That's a good question. 
[00:20:00]  Young Samuel's typing.  When did the bad mood begin?  Was it this morning?  Or was it last night?  Or was it even yesterday knowing that today was the day?  You know when you're in school and you got an oral report?  Yeah.  Oral?  And you're scared to go first.  Yeah.  So you sit there, and now you're suffering as everyone else is going up there, and you're  like, why didn't I just go first and get this fucking out of the way?  Get it over with.  Yesterday, we should have met with them.  Because since yesterday, when they were hiding behind the door, these sick fucks, because 
[00:20:30]  now they know how we try to escape.  Did you see that?  No.  That means they crawled.  That means they crawled under the view of the window.  They did a military low crawl.  I'm not even joking.  I'm not kidding either.  Because I'm always looking around for bosses going, all right, who do we have to deal  with today?  And you left.  You're absolutely right.  I think the mics were still on.  You go, oh, they're right here.  I'm like, that's impossible.  I opened the door.  Now, I look out the glass.  I saw no one come up the hallway.  See, they can't come down this hall at all because we can see clear down the hallway. 
[00:21:00]  Over here, there's couches in the way of the lower part of the window.  Yeah.  So I'm thinking they came from over here.  Then they stand up behind the door because we can't see through the door.  There's no way they didn't crawl past their window.  I'm like, oh, cool.  I open the door and I'm staring at one of them right in the face.  Yes.  Or they might have a thing if the ceiling worked out because there are curtains that  they can hide behind if they repel from the ceiling.  If they come down from the ceiling like Mission Impossible or something.  They probably do.  There's a little area back there where they probably go up through the ceiling and they 
[00:21:30]  come and they fucking repel.  Repel down behind the door.  One of them hides in the phone screening room.  And then what?  Crawls down the hall?  Oh, man.  How did they get around?  I've seen Bladder poke his little head out.  It's kind of cute.  I'll look and I'll be like, wow, E-Rock suddenly got a lot better looking.  Oh, it's Bladder.  So as soon as we blew off the meeting yesterday, I went home and it just started eating away.  This is my thing, man.  We all have our thing.  Started eating away all day long.  Yeah.  I wasn't in a bad mood, but it was in the back of my head. 
[00:22:00]  And then I came in here today and it got a lot worse.  And then just bringing it up on the air just fucking set me off.  I got a great idea.  10 o'clock.  Right.  We make a phone call to his office.  Yeah.  I'm thinking about settling.  Come on down and see me.  And then we fucking run.  We run to the elevator.  Yeah.  Right.  Howard gets to sue the company and he's still the golden boy.  Yeah. 
[00:22:30]  Now we're talking.  Makes a bloody fortune, which, by the way, they gave him after they said they had no money  for us whatsoever.  Give him a bloody fortune.  Give him a part-time schedule.  He's working part-time now, but we're not really supposed to talk about it.  And he's suing the company on top of it.  And he's still the golden boy.  And later this morning, we'll get yelled at for something.  And we're paces of shit.  Right.  That's what we are.  Right.  That's why I can't do this.  Let us do our show, man.  I love doing the show with these guys.  I just don't like meetings.  I love walking from the elevator to here. 
[00:23:00]  And I love leaving from here to the elevator.  To the elevator.  And as soon as you start mixing me in with your bullshit, I'm out of my mind.  Once Yon City comes in, it's over, Johnny.  Because then there'll be more empty promises.  Oh, interns.  Oh, yeah.  Get on that.  And then three months from now, we'll have another meeting.  Why we don't have interns and all the rest of this shit.  I love the turnaround, though.  Like, why don't they have interns?  Come on.  Let's get on that.  And it's like, yeah, let's get on that.  Me and Anthony roll our eyes, by the way, Scott, when you do that.  Why don't you guys got any? 
[00:23:30]  We roll our eyes.  Yeah, yeah.  Because we've seen it for years.  Every issue we bring up, get on that.  And we just roll our eyes like, really?  I've seen it for years.  I've had it for years.  Oh, cancer of the neck.  Yes.  Cancer of the neck.  I'm a necker.  Cancer of the neck.  I've had it for years.  Bunch of mice running around.  He has dumb white mice trying to cure himself.  He's all dead with a great wig.  Dumb wig.  I love that movie.  Russell Brand looks like a tranny now. 
[00:24:00]  Does he?  Weird looking.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  What did he do?  Did he get fat?  No, I think he's getting face work for Hollywood.  Do you think he had a little work, man?  That's my guess.  For what, though?  How old the guy is he?  Older than he wanted to be?  I fucking hate that guy.  Fuck him.  Russell Brand?  Yeah.  Why?  Because he blew us off.  By the way.  Fuck him.  This is Opie on the equivalent of sodium pentothal.  Yeah.  So you can just ask him anything, and he'll give you the most honest response right now.  No problem.  What do you think of Russell Brando? 
[00:24:30]  I fucking hate him.  See?  It's great.  Do you like me?  And I love Jimmy.  Oh, thank you.  I love doing radio with you guys.  I love you, you little scallop.  So go on some dumb message board and start talking, because I do like doing radio with these  guys.  Absolutely.  I just don't like all the other bullshit.  It's the crap that goes around it.  And Russell Brand, that Arthur, was the biggest piece of shit.  The biggest piece of shit.  Yes.  Yes.  And he's not a stand-up guy.  He's a fucking asshole. 
[00:25:00]  Because when no one knew who he was, he did our show, we had a really good time.  A really fucking good time.  He did it twice.  He did it twice.  Yep.  As he was coming up.  And we even said, I said it to his face.  I'm like, you're obviously going to be a big star.  Because that Forgetting Marshall, I think, was the one that put him over.  And no one knew him.  And then he came in.  And I said, we'll never see you again.  He laughed.  Oh, no.  I think he said you're right.  Did he say that?  I think he said you're right or something like that.  Well, at least he's honest.  So fuck him. 
[00:25:30]  And he got influenced by Hollywood.  So, you know, he's a dope.  Because he was kind of rogue and edgy.  And then he fucking takes the Arthur movie.  What a dummy.  Scripts coming in.  He's probably like, oh, I'll take that one.  Right.  That's a good one.  I won't go on.  I'll be an Anthony.  Anthony.  Man.  Yeah, it kind of sucks.  Because now you look at the time.  And you go like, eh, it's cool.  You know, doing our show.  But then you know what's coming.  Enough about me.  I mean, what's your feelings about the whole thing? 
[00:26:00]  I can't stand sitting in those fucking meetings.  Do you know I literally.  But why?  I'm just about nodding off.  But why?  Because it is.  I don't mind.  It's the same meeting that we've had for years.  Nothing ever gets accomplished.  And I consider it, even though, believe me, I have nothing to do today.  But it's a complete waste of time that I'd rather be doing nothing.  Right.  Yeah.  We don't need to have a relationship.  You proved a long time ago that this isn't a relationship. 
[00:26:30]  It's nonsense.  You try to fuck us as hard as you can.  And we try to protect ourselves.  And we lost big time.  You know, congratulations.  You have disgruntled employees because you decided to beat the shit out of us during negotiations.  And we're not alone.  Believe me.  Not even a little raised to say, hey, man, you guys have really brought in a lot of subscribers.  Yeah.  No, we had to fight just to get back to where we were.  You know, when I was in construction, I never met with the boss.  I had a shop supervisor guy.  And he was the guy I dealt with.  And if there was a problem, the shop supervisor would go to a lower level boss who would then 
[00:27:00]  go to the boss.  Like the boss.  I never saw the boss.  The boss.  Buffers.  Yeah.  Plenty of buffers.  The boss never walked into the shop to see what was going on.  He didn't even know my name.  It wasn't like, hey, Anthony, how's the fucking bender working?  Right.  How's that going?  How's the fucking clinch collars coming?  Nothing.  And that's what it should be here.  Yeah, if I felt something was really getting accomplished, I would skip down the hall.  I really would. 
[00:27:30]  Skip like a fairy Mary right to the office.  I'd wear a goddamn tutu if I have to.  You know, but I know these are just nonsense bullshit.  Yep.  You know, kiss the ring.  Then I smooch it a little bit.  Wrap tightly around the testes, too.  We didn't need to specify.  All right, Jimmy, I'm sorry.  It's getting enough if he's holding it.  If a chick is holding it. 
[00:28:00]  Imagine if someone's like, kiss my cock ring and it's in the palm of their hand and you  see a hair.  Some gnarly hairs.  Maybe some dried white flecks.  Petite flecks.  You know, simple as this.  He's got to show something, finally.  Yeah.  Yeah, we do need to.  And if he gives us, write this down.  Oh, another one.  What are we up to so far, Sam?  Help me out.  Leave meeting F.  Let's say I so far recorded you saying you will leave the meeting if you were met with  a raised voice, met with belittling, offered a handshake. 
[00:28:30]  The mics in Times Square are brought up or any requests for you guys to stop complaining  are brought up.  Yeah, that's good.  That's a good start.  Nice.  Good start.  Hey, this one.  If he says, you guys are in a great position with this company right now, I leave.  Yeah.  Now that might confuse-  Bent over the couch.  That might confuse a lot of people.  He actually used that crap with us over a year ago and then negotiations came around.  Guess what?  We weren't in a good fucking place with the company. 
[00:29:00]  No.  Then it was like, you guys are in a bob.  You guys not in a good position.  Then he uses the excuse that they can't give us more money because I tweeted a picture  of a memo that said this place might have bedbugs.  Sorry, I didn't want to bring bedbugs home to my fucking family.  What do you want to do?  Little friends.  He says, that's bad for the company.  And then Howard goes on the air and really blasts them about it and is on TV about it.  Yup.  So I talked to my gay friend yesterday. 
[00:29:30]  Oh, how'd that go?  He's good.  I mean, he's a friend of mine and he's attached and shit.  And I asked him about two things.  I actually tried to educate myself yesterday.  I asked him about the gay marriage.  He goes, yeah, it's great.  He goes, I don't understand why people have a problem with this because it'll never affect them.  He goes, most people will never even know that, you know, gays are getting married around them.  And I go, well, are you going to get married? 
[00:30:00]  Because he's been with his partner.  Lover.  And it was hilarious.  It was a male response.  He goes, God, I might blow up someone's spot, but fuck it.  He goes, look, I make more money than my fucking partner.  I need to know what this is all about.  I'm not just going to sign away, you know, into this contract.  And if, God forbid, we split up, all of a sudden I lose my shit.  I'm like, you're actually a guy.  Yeah.  So he goes, I got to see what all that means.  And I go, well, doesn't that give you more rights and stuff? 
[00:30:30]  He goes, I went to a lawyer.  He said, we went to a lawyer, I guess, five years ago and got everything, you know, taken care of.  Hunky dory.  So if, you know, if his partner is sick, he could visit.  If, you know, God forbid, one of them dies, everything is worked out.  He goes, so technically I don't need anything else by being married.  He says it's great for the young gays.  The young gay?  The young gay that still have dreams.  He thinks it's great for the young gays.  Ideas that things are happening.  Because, you know, it could be more about stability and stuff like that. 
[00:31:00]  Yeah.  I think that's what they're looking for.  But I also think it's some kind of status thing.  Like, hey, look, we made it.  It's like, who gives a shit, really?  Symbolically, it's a commitment.  Like, I think it doesn't do anything for me.  But he's telling gay people you can't get married and all of a sudden they want to commit to each other.  How do they show the commitment ceremony like they're teenagers?  Right.  And I said yesterday, I said yesterday, the reason, don't think Cuomo is this great fucking human rights guy. 
[00:31:30]  He saw dollar signs, and I said it yesterday, and now it's one of the big headlines today, that this is going to be a windfall for New York State.  Big money for the state.  And that's what he started, I bet you, crunching numbers up there and all.  But he said, man, if we pass this through, we can make some money in this state.  And that's gay money.  Gay money is...  Gay money.  Crisp.  It's crisp.  And, yeah, a lot of it.  Stupid Chris Christie won't pass a big fat dope taking helicopters to his kids. 
[00:32:00]  He's just like, man, not Jersey.  He's a fat slob.  Yeah, what do you mean, not Jersey?  It's like, how about you fucking fix Camden and worry about that instead of worrying about who's sticking their dick in everybody's ass getting married?  Why don't you mind your business and fix Camden, shithead?  You have fucking the greatest slum on the planet in Jersey, and you're worried about gays fucking holding hands and going, you're my wife, husband, slash whatever?  Who gives a fuck?  People realize it is the worst city in the country. 
[00:32:30]  It's the greatest slum on the earth.  They had to fire half the...  Didn't they hire the cops back?  They had to hire them back.  They fired the cops for like a month, and then everyone went, ah!  And they had to hire all the cops back again.  And you're morally policing other people?  Yeah.  Who gives a fuck?  Yeah.  What a dope.  What a complete dope.  Did you see Louis C.K.'s statement on the gay marriage thing?  I finally read it yesterday.  I did not. 
[00:33:00]  I saw it on BuzzFeed.  It was a post on his Facebook.  It's kind of going viral.  Oh, there it is.  Who wants to read this?  Oh, boy.  Let me see.  It doesn't have any effect on your life.  That's what my friend yesterday said.  It has no effect on your life for the most part.  You won't even know this is going on around you.  All right.  Sorry.  No, no, no.  I just want to reiterate that.  It doesn't have any effect on your life.  What do you care?  People try to talk about it like it's a social issue.  Like when you see someone stand up on a talk show and say, how am I supposed to explain 
[00:33:30]  to my child that two men are getting married?  I don't know.  It's your shitty kid.  You fucking tell them.  Why is it anyone else's problem?  Two guys are in love, but they can't get married because you don't want to talk to your ugly  child for five fucking minutes?  Louis C.K.  Is that great?  Your ugly fucking...  And I could do without the salty language, Lou.  Yes, exactly.  A little blue.  I don't like when Louie works blue.  I don't like blue Lou, and we say U-E, not E-W for this, but he's right. 
[00:34:00]  I didn't know this coming in from Buffalo.  Gay money is almost as strong as the Euro.  Gay money.  Yeah.  What's the trade?  What's it trading for?  So the other thing I discussed with my gay friend, because I haven't seen in a while,  he cuts my hair, was the Tracy Morgan thing.  And he was offended by it.  And he loves comedy.  He was offended by the gay thing.  I think all gays were.  But I talked to him about it.  I talked to him about the Asian thing that happens to radio guys and all that.  And I go, really?  He goes, what bothered him about it was the fact that Tracy said he would shoot his son. 
[00:34:30]  I go, okay.  So I need a reference point.  I go, what comics do you like?  And he goes, you know who my favorite is?  And I forgot because I half listened.  Was it a gay comic?  No.  Oh.  No.  Lisa Lampanelli.  Oh, boy.  Wow.  I laughed at him.  I'm like, Lisa Lampanelli and you have a problem with what Tracy Morgan said?  Yeah, she's very offensive.  I go, you do realize what she...  And he said, yeah, but when she's doing it, it's fun and stuff. 
[00:35:00]  And she's not saying, you know, I would shoot my son.  That was the line for him, shooting someone over being gay.  Okay, so that's your interpretation of what she does?  Because other people would interpret it as being a hate speech.  I find Lisa offensive to look at.  She's a pig.  Oh, what am I, on a rose tongue?  She's funny.  Here's why I think Lisa...  She's a funny lady, but she's not a good-looking broad.  This is why I think Lisa gets away with it.  Because she embraces the people. 
[00:35:30]  Like, she talks, like she makes...  She sees nigger on stage.  I mean, she's brutal, but she...  Does it in bed, too?  She fucking does.  Right after, fuck me.  Lisa's boyfriend's a lot...  She's married now, but she had a black boyfriend.  And she really likes black people.  And she likes gay people.  And she makes that apparent.  So, she makes...  I think she sets it up where you know you're being attacked by someone who likes you.  Right.  And I think that's why people are more accepting of her doing it. 
[00:36:00]  Not because she's a woman, but because she'll like...  You know, I love the fags.  And she laughs.  And you know that she likes gay people.  Right.  She's not...  I think Tracy, to get away with that kind of material, probably should have let people  know, like, look, I really do like gay people.  I'm not...  This is not coming from a real place.  Yeah.  And then I...  And then he asked me, he goes, is Tracy Morgan funny?  I'm like, wow.  Yeah.  I go, he really is funny, man.  He's edgy and just, like, unpredictable.  And he's a funny...  I said, Tracy Morgan's really funny just doing off-the-cuff shit. 
[00:36:30]  You know?  And I think that's what gets him in trouble.  Yeah.  Because I really don't think he puts an act together for the most part on a stage.  No, I don't think he does either.  I think he has some thought stars, maybe a couple things, and then he just goes.  It's not a well-written act, I don't believe.  Yeah.  And I go, I swear to you...  I don't want to use the guy's name.  I go, I swear to you that he was trying to be funny.  But he didn't know this.  Yeah.  He goes...  Because he saw what the media, like, portrayed.  He goes...  Right.  He really thought that Tracy just went after gays.  I'm like, wow, that is the furthest from the truth, sir. 
[00:37:00]  The furthest from the truth.  I mean, you could be a fan and not like it, but I'm telling you...  I'm telling you, the guy was just doing his act that night, you know?  Yeah, I don't think he had any ill will toward anybody when he was saying it.  Right.  But his line is, look, I don't care, you know, if comics go after gays and any other group.  It was just a fact.  And I'm not saying I agree with him, but it made me think a little bit more about it.  He goes, my problem was that, you know, Tracy basically said he would shoot his son over it.  Yeah.  All right, I could see where that might be sensitive to you, you know? 
[00:37:30]  I don't think I agree.  I really want to be one that thinks that anything should be said on a comedy stage, as long as you're trying to be funny.  That's what I think.  And I think you guys police each other anyway.  If someone's being hacky and really has an agenda, you're going to beat them up.  And the club owners themselves will police it pretty well also.  Do you know what Jim David said?  And I'm not just whoring my show tomorrow, Wednesday at 5 on Raw Dog.  You should, because it's going to be a good one.  It's with Jim and Rick Crum, and we were talking about it, and he was acknowledging that you should say what you want to say on stage, because he's a comedian. 
[00:38:00]  But he was making the point that you just get sick of it after a while.  And he said something which I hadn't considered, and it was a good point.  He goes, it's not a level playing field, and that's why it's harder, because in life, it's not a level playing field.  So when you hit someone like that, it's almost like you're throwing a punch downward as opposed to even.  And I guess that kind of made me think, I still think you should say what you want, but I do.  Okay, that's why maybe you should probably make sure you're selling it right, because you are going after somebody who does not have the same rights you do. 
[00:38:30]  You should go after them and make fun of them, but kind of just make sure that they know where it's coming from.  You know what I love about comedy clubs? You know, we have to deal with so much bullshit, you know, day in and day out, and a lot of political correctness.  And you walk into that comedy club, and you know there's just complete freedom, man.  Yeah.  And you laugh over some outrageous shit, and then guess what? 
[00:39:00]  You leave the comedy club, and then you're back in this shitty world where everyone is so concerned about what is being said about them.  And you wish everybody felt that way walking in.  That's exactly what you want people feeling.  Why don't they?  There should be a huge sign at the door.  This is not real life.  I don't know, man.  They feel like they have to agree, or they have to challenge it by not laughing, or by letting you know they object.  It's really weird.  Right.  I would love to know what people truly go to a comedy club for, because it's like, you're going to have an emotion pulled out of you. 
[00:39:30]  Yeah, you know, why go?  Like, what is their intent to go if they're ever going to leave offended?  Then why the fuck did you go in the first place?  Yeah, you're right.  I remember when I started stand-up, me and my buddy Tyler would go walk.  We saw Florentine.  We saw Otto and George.  We saw all these guys.  We would sit up front, and I always knew enough not to heckle, because I respected it too much.  But it never occurred to me to be bothered by anything they were saying.  Like, I just knew I was watching this great thing, and it never occurred to me to go, oh, I don't agree. 
[00:40:00]  There was jokes I didn't laugh at or like, but it never occurred to me to make it about myself, and I wanted to do comedy.  It was weird.  I guess some people think that it has to be about them, even when they're in the audience.  If they don't agree, or if they don't like it, everybody has to know.  I think simpletons just make it about themselves, unfortunately.  They just can't think out of the box.  They're just extremely simple.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  Why can't you, like, figure out, oh, wow, that was pretty outrageous, but I'm in a comedy club. 
[00:40:30]  Everyone else around me is enjoying it.  You know what I mean?  That one person that has to pipe up, shut up.  Shut the fuck up.  It's not about you.  Look around the room.  Guess what?  Everyone else is enjoying it.  So you're in the minority, so shut the fuck up.  And sneak out if you have to.  I love when you guys fucking, you know, just slam a heckler.  Love it.  There's something.  I remember one time I was doing a pretty clean set.  It might have been for the Jay Leno show or the Tonight Show before that, but it was for a television set. 
[00:41:00]  It was a little bit of edgy content, but it wasn't dirty.  And some guy did some reference, and some guy at stage right goes, there's ladies present.  And I look over, and it's this douche.  And he's sitting with his, like, wife and daughters.  And I could see if I was up there doing, like, rape jokes.  All right, fine.  You weren't?  No.  Not for NBC.  Only CBS loves rape jokes.  NBC frowns on them. 
[00:41:30]  It's a whole network thing you gotta learn.  And oh, did I brutalize him.  Because I hadn't been cursing.  So I really fucking, really killed him for the fact that I had been doing TV clean material like this for a fucking TV set.  And I called him out for showboating to try to impress the people he was with.  Like, I'll stand up for you ladies.  And I don't remember what I said, but I know it got uncomfortable for the audience.  And he shut his fucking dopey, silver-haired mouth.  And then I tore the diapers off an old lady at TSA, and I kicked her chair over.  I said, what do you think of that, Ethel? 
[00:42:00]  There's a lump in your diaper.  I hope it's explosive.  I hope it's not a doody.  What is this, plastique?  That dumb TSA worker.  Anyone that has kids understands what could happen with these diapers.  Holy shit.  Of course there's a lot of urine in that damn diaper, you dope.  It's not plastic explosive.  She's the cast of Do the Right Thing, fucking looking through her fucking bag.  She's 95.  Of course she shits herself.  Poor old crow.  Poor old lady.  Just wants to take a flight to go home and die in peace. 
[00:42:30]  Not a bad old crow at that.  He's got jungle fever.  Pour her titers off.  Titers.  Poor old lady.  Oh, the final point that was made yesterday during the haircut.  I got to ask you about the gay pride parade with all that.  Ah, right.  The flamboyant gay people.  And he says, you know, I avoided all costs.  You know, I met friends in Manhattan yesterday, but we didn't go close to that because it's  an embarrassment.  He says it's embarrassing. 
[00:43:00]  So he finds it embarrassing.  Of course.  And he says most of their community does, you know, kind of find it embarrassing.  Is he more conservative, guy?  I would say not, man.  He's into hair bands.  Which is weird, right?  If you think about it.  Fiscally conservative, anally liberal.  But I think.  I don't think a lot of, I would imagine not a lot of gay guys are into hair bands.  No.  Maybe they're into the look of the whole thing.  Yeah, maybe. 
[00:43:30]  The actual music?  I don't know.  That always surprised me about this person.  Loves Bon Jovi.  I bet.  You're just cute.  I got a nice email yesterday from Pamela.  Anderson?  Adlon.  No, no, no.  She only just sends me clit photos and writes LOL.  And I'm like, Pam, please.  No, Pam Adlon, who had some very nice things to say about our show, how much she enjoyed  listening.  So thank you.  Who's she?  She was on Lucky Louie.  And she's also on the show.  Oh, Pam, Pam?  Pam, Pam, yeah.  Oh, right on. 
[00:44:00]  I know her.  She was saying how much she enjoyed the gay discussion yesterday.  Wow, nice.  Tell her to come in and say hi to us.  I think she's in L.A.  So?  She'll be in New York eventually, right?  Possibly.  I'm sure she will.  Yeah.  I think possibly.  I don't know if she'll ever be in the East Coast.  I've never seen her here.  Yeah.  Is Louie going to do our show?  I know we overslept.  Oh, did he oversleep the day he was supposed to be here?  Is that what his agent said?  I know.  Maybe we lost Louie, you think?  You think we lost Louie?  I sure hope not.  No, you didn't lose Louie.  I hope not either.  I overslept, but I mean, we could still promote Louie. 
[00:44:30]  Yeah, I don't think so.  The second episode is tonight, right?  Isn't that Wednesday or Tuesday?  I thought it was Tuesday.  I thought it was Thursday.  Thursday.  Oh, is it Thursday?  Yeah.  I'm all fucked up because I got the first four episodes, so I don't even know when it's  really on.  We didn't have Elijah Wood.  Thank you.  Oh, right, right, right.  A week ago.  That was less.  Right.  Thursday.  Right.  Right.  Right.  Right.  Right.  Right.  I forwarded you my Linda Hogan questions, please.  Print them out.  Linda Hogan.  Hogan.  I only got a few.  I wish we would have had this book.  There's some interesting stuff, though. 
[00:45:00]  Don't worry, I got this one.  Do you?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, boy.  Oh, yeah.  I have a couple of questions I want to ask her.  Well, get them in early.  So, are you a Hulkamaniac or something?  Oh, God.  She looks good for 50.  God damn.  Big juicy ass.  She's sexy, man.  Yeah, you like her?  Fuck yes.  She's all right.  Maybe if you were a wrestler.  She looks like a clown.  He would take her around to have sex with the others. 
[00:45:30]  I'm lost.  I cannot wait.  Oh, you want this clip?  To ask her about The Ultimate Warrior.  About The Ultimate Warrior.  Ask her about this clip?  Yeah, please.  Play the clip.  I got to hear it.  Dirty laundry.  Doesn't even sound like a warrior.  Like that you and Linda had an open marriage.  You were both whores that did slutty stuff on the side.  Neither one of you had a problem with the other one getting thrills on the side.  In fact, Terry, you tried to get me to sample those thrills. 
[00:46:00]  You know, being the only wrestler that said no to so many things in wrestling,  I bet I'm the only guy that ever said no to doing your wife.  And then the bong, the stinger, the music.  It's an action movie when he talks.  It really is.  When he talks, it's a movie trailer, yeah.  Do you think Hulk Hogan can beat up The Ultimate Warrior in real life?  I don't know.  Hulk Hogan has a lot of medical problems. 
[00:46:30]  A lot of arthritis.  He's got to kick him in the knee.  He's done.  Yeah, he's a very strong man, but he's got bad knees.  The warrior's a strong guy, you think?  Oh, yeah.  The warrior's also a very strong guy.  He seems like a psycho, like an angry dude.  He is a psychopath.  Yeah, he's got problems.  You think he's a problem in a bar?  He's a major problem, yeah.  He wouldn't shy away from a brawl.  You don't think so?  The warrior, no.  You think people would know who he is, though, in a bar?  I think not at first sight, but somebody would pick up on it, and then word would travel through.  And they wouldn't give him a problem? 
[00:47:00]  Nah, not if he's The Ultimate Warrior.  It's probably hard to hit him and knock him down.  He's used to taking bumps.  He's massive, too.  Is he?  Yeah.  Yeah, he's in good shape for an older guy.  Yeah.  He looks scarier to me now.  Oh, that's how he looks?  Oh, my God.  That was like a year or two ago.  I'm going to worry his hair.  That's the only thing he lost.  He's still got muscle tone.  Yeah.  Get the fuck out of here.  I didn't know he kept himself together.  Most of those older wrestlers just look like Doc Gooden.  God, poor Doc. 
[00:47:30]  Poor Doc.  Big, fat Doc Gooden.  I know.  It's so depressing, being a huge Mets fan from back in the day.  Thank you.  To see Doc Gooden like that.  Oh, my God.  Hey, we got a victory, finally.  Can't ban violent video sales to kids.  I like this.  Yeah, California.  I like this a lot.  And the reason is, you're like, really?  Yeah, because if they ban the fucking video games as far as kids go, we don't get to  play them.  Yeah.  Because then these, you know, Rockstar and all this, they're not going to make violent 
[00:48:00]  video games for just a small percentage of their consumer base.  Yeah.  I don't even like calling it violent video games.  There's violence in them.  Believe me.  I do know that.  But that just shows how out of touch these dopes that are making the laws are.  Yeah.  It's way more than violence in these games.  It's action games.  There's violence in them.  Plenty of it.  But there's a strategy.  There's a puzzle solving aspect to it.  There's a lot of shit going on.  It's like, just, what do you want to do?  Be a banker in the game?  Well, look at that.  I'm a teller. 
[00:48:30]  Let me make sure I counted up my drawer right.  Oh, I'm 20 bucks short.  Now I got to find it.  It's not fun.  Real life stinks.  Right.  The Supreme Court.  This was the U.S. Supreme Court.  I know it did.  And it was seven to two.  And the dissenting opinions, separately written, were Stephen Breyer, who said his point, which is, I think he's a liberal.  I could be wrong, but I think that the court was pretty mixed on this one.  And he said that what, like, you can't sell a kid pornography. 
[00:49:00]  So if you can't sell a kid pornography, he made, like, the violent sex.  He's like, why is it okay to sell a violent, which, okay, that was his point.  And then Clarence Thomas felt that freedom of speech didn't go to kids.  Or override the right of a parent to have their kids not sold something.  Like, you know what I mean?  Like, the kid doesn't get freedom of speech over the parents not wanting the kid to have it.  Yeah, that makes perfect sense.  So I think they both made pretty good points.  But I'm glad it lost.  And the FCC has something going to the Supreme Court, too. 
[00:49:30]  Right.  Can they label the games?  I'm a little confused.  Oh, yeah, I'm sure they can.  Yeah, they can still label.  Sure.  Yeah, they put the ratings on them.  I think it's better for games now.  Wait, so what's the difference?  Can't ban violent videos?  You can't find them for selling them to kids.  Oh, I got you.  Like, you can't find them a lot of money because it is a freedom.  So it's just a warning label.  Like, you could be a 15-year-old kid and go, look, I want Call of Duty or whatever.  And even though there's a warning label on it, you could still sell it to that kid.  Yeah, and I think you can't.  I believe so because they said that, I don't know who wrote it in the opinion, but they said that violent images have never been protected as far as. 
[00:50:00]  Right.  Like, we have never been, whatever.  They've always been allowable.  And I guess, like, they said Snow White has a violent, you know, part to it.  Or you can't get into that.  It's not a health issue either because it's never been proven that that has any detriment to kids or adults or anybody.  Well, every school shooter plays them.  Like cigarettes smoking.  Please, we all know. 
[00:50:30]  But it's just the price you pay for freedom of speech.  Once in a while, 20 kids are getting picked off in an elementary school.  What are you going to do?  I'm sure there's no study, but I bet you it's kept a lot of kids out of trouble in general.  Yeah, yeah.  I would love to see some kind of study.  Playing some dopey games.  Keep the kids in their shitty rooms.  Yeah.  I kind of like walking around and not seeing kids.  It is kind of cool.  When we were growing up, man, kids were on the street.  We've talked about this a million fucking times.  You don't see kids anymore.  I've said it a million times.  In my neighborhood, you see little fucking toddlers, and then you see, like, 18-year-olds. 
[00:51:00]  I don't know where the kids are between toddlers and 18.  They must be playing video games.  You know how nice it is not to almost run kids over on bikes?  I don't see kids on bikes.  I don't care.  It's weird.  Like, I agree with the free speech, obviously.  But I do think there's a connection.  Really?  Yes.  Because as a porn addict, as a guy who, like, has watched so much porn, and it's my responsibility.  It's no one's fault but mine.  But it desensitizes you. 
[00:51:30]  It really, like, you really see things differently once you've seen so many pornographic images.  My own fault.  But if you're 12 and 13, and you get desensitized to the image of aiming and shooting and blood splattering,  it does desensitize you.  I'm not saying freedom of speech should suffer, but I also won't not acknowledge the reality of it.  I would argue that point.  I don't think it's realistic enough.  Porno is realistic.  True.  It's a real dick going in a real vagina, and there's real cum. 
[00:52:00]  It's like it's real.  This is, you know it's not real.  Have you ever had sex like a porno?  Let's be honest.  Is that real?  Come on.  But you know it's not a real soldier.  You're not watching.  Now, I would say that if you took kids and let them watch actual war videos of people being shot and killed,  that would be shocking, and that might desensitize them to death and war and stuff like that. 
[00:52:30]  But a game itself, a kid knows it's not real.  So I don't think that desensitizes you.  Just like any other game did.  We used to play fucking Army when we were kids.  There was no fucking video game.  You'd grab your plastic gun from Toys R Us.  You'd run around the yard going, bop, bop, bop, bop.  You're dead.  You're dead.  And that was the same thing.  It didn't desensitize you, though.  You're right.  It is actually not real.  But don't forget, sex is something that you engage in, and you're sexual your whole life. 
[00:53:00]  You don't go on killing sprees your whole life.  When that finally happens, because look at how many there are now compared to 25, 30 years ago.  It just didn't happen 30 years ago.  I don't know.  I'm not sure about that.  I haven't done my research, but I don't know.  And I don't know if video games is the reason for it.  I think it's part of it.  Not all of it.  I think it's part of it.  But again, I'm not saying that they should.  I agree with the Supreme Court decision.  I know you agree with it, but I don't even think, I won't even go as far as to say I think it has anything to do with violence in schools and stuff like that. 
[00:53:30]  I really don't think it's just another form of entertainment.  We brought up cartoons earlier.  Did it hurt when you saw Yosemite Sam shoot Bugs Bunny or shit like that?  First-person shooter games are, again.  Allowable.  But I think that they feel different than watching Yosemite Sam.  I've only played a couple of them.  I think it's an incredibly small percentage. 
[00:54:00]  I find more pleasure, though, in the skill of a game.  Yeah.  And even like growing up, I don't know.  It was more pleasure in the skill of shooting it and hitting your target than it is going, yeah, I'm killing people.  You're 38, though.  I mean, you're not, wink, wink.  At the time.  But I'm saying, you're not, you guys aren't kids who are disgruntled and angry and being picked on.  But doesn't it blow off some stress, too, and some steam as well?  You could have that argument.  It does.  No, I mean, I'm not talking about school shootings. 
[00:54:30]  No, I know what you mean.  You've got a kid that's like out of his mind, fucking frustrated, stressed out.  He throws his favorite game in.  And don't you think maybe by the end of the session he's a calmer kid?  Yes.  But I think the method of making you calm is that you're pointing, shooting, and watching brains come out.  Yeah.  Well, that's cool.  I don't want anybody to fucking call up and go, you're being a hypocrite, Jimmy.  Because I'm not saying it's the old.  I just think it's one component in it.  But again, it shouldn't affect anybody.  I would say how could it not affect? 
[00:55:00]  But I think that number is so extremely low that it's not worth our time to worry about.  Yeah.  That's where I'm at with this.  Yeah, because anything can affect anybody negatively.  Sure.  And I think you're right.  I think it's such a small percentage, then it's inconsequential.  Why weren't there any, though?  And there's probably different reasons.  I think there were.  30 years ago, I didn't remember hearing about these.  School shootings?  Constant school.  There's a lot more of them now.  Oh.  Are there, though?  Yeah.  Oh, I heard.  Oh, I wonder if we could get a clip of this. 
[00:55:30]  Watch the Penn & Teller bullshit on video games.  I heard about this.  They had a kid.  I think we talked to Penn about this one.  They had a kid who played violent video games, shoot a real gun, and he cried after doing it.  He started crying.  I saw that one.  Because the kid's like, yeah, man.  They're like, yeah, he shot a real gun.  And he's like, he was crying.  He's crying.  I just think that all of the ones who shoot, most of them go on those, play those.  I just think it's one.  I think it just desensitizes you to pointing, aiming from that point of view, seeing a head, 
[00:56:00]  and seeing mist come out of it when you pull the trigger.  I just think it's almost like flight simulators.  When you get into a flight simulator, you know you're not really flying, but it does train you for real flying,  and it does make you feel like you're really flying, even though your knowledge is that you're not really flying.  So when you're in those situations, it's almost like if there was...  That must explain why so many kids just run into the cockpit and take a plane off and start flying it around.  Oh, that's right.  They're not. 
[00:56:30]  No, no, no.  I mean for adult pilots, like not kids.  Because kids are not allowed in because the door's locked.  But I mean, you know what I mean?  You know that you're not...  Like when a pilot goes into a flight simulator, he knows this is not real.  But it still feels real enough to train him for real life.  But then what makes you want to do real shit, though?  Where's the leap?  That's where we're going.  Where's the trigger that makes you go, this violent video game, this, you know, Call of Duty, let's say, is great, realistic looking. 
[00:57:00]  I can put the crosshairs on a head, watch it explode.  And that's entertaining.  What makes somebody go from that to, boy, I want to grab a real gun and do this?  I think your parents being shitty and disinterested is part of it.  You probably having some mental illness, fucking being picked on or just chemically unbalanced and hating yourself.  So have all that stuff.  I'm not blaming video games.  It's on TV right now.  So have all those other things, but no violent video games. 
[00:57:30]  And do you think it would still be...  I just noticed.  I know what you're going to say.  I just saw that and I know what you're going to say.  You're the stupid media and violent video games.  Sorry, I got to jump in.  Violent video games is a hot topic today, whatever.  And they have a B-roll of video games that are at least 10 years old.  These fucking dopes.  You're CNN.  It was horrible.  How lazy are you?  It was horrible.  They just showed a game from 1995.  You see the pixelation on the...  I think that was a woman.  Wouldn't somebody go like, what game should I get? 
[00:58:00]  They're so lazy.  What game should I get?  Oh, yeah.  Get some footage of Call of Duty.  You got some young people that work at CNN.  Figure it out.  Get some Call of Duty footage.  Yeah.  No, they grabbed some kind of thing where...  Do you even know what game that was?  Had no clue what game that was.  I would guess 10 years ago.  It was ancient.  Was it Duke Nukem?  Nah.  They always go to Duke Nukem.  I think it was even before that.  And I know Duke Nukem, you know, they got a new version out, but they always go with the old Duke Nukem.  Yeah.  Unfortunately, I think a lot of responsibility is on the parents, but there's a lot of shitty 
[00:58:30]  parents out there.  Sure.  Now that I'm a parent, I'm not changing my opinion on violent video games whatsoever.  No, I don't see it making that big a...  I mean, this parenting is a lot of work.  It's tough work, you know, and you got to put in the time and explain this shit to your  kid.  I don't want any of this adjusted.  I haven't changed my opinion on any of this crap.  But Ann asked a question about what if all those components or one is removed or whatever.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Without the video games, of course there would be school shootings. 
[00:59:00]  I'm not blaming.  I'm only saying that they're one piece of a puzzle.  I'm not making any judgment on it.  I just think realistically, it's like saying, I don't believe that porn causes rape, but  does it desensitize you to sex with real people?  Yes, I know that because I live it.  So I'm a fucking 42-year-old guy, and intellectually, I know a lot more than a 13-year-old or 12-year-old.  If I was playing those video games growing up, my views on violence or pulling the trigger  might be different.  Just like I was so sexually fucking addicted from that age growing up, and my views on sex 
[00:59:30]  are a lot different now than they probably should be.  I think you're an exception, though.  I think you're an exception, though, because I think you do have an addictive personality.  So I don't know.  Porn's a billion-dollar industry.  I think anyone not jerking off a lot is the exception.  We grew up with very violent cartoons.  Images, cartoons.  Very violent.  I mean, I thought nothing of it, but it's to the point where they have taken out most  of the violence in these cartoons. 
[01:00:00]  So what did that do to us, is the question.  Yeah, if school shootings are up, did that help the violent cartoons?  They were extremely violent.  Having a rating system where kids aren't allowed to see violent images in movies as much as  they used to.  Parents not being home now.  Also, in the last 25 years, both parents work a lot more, so there's less supervision.  There's a lot of stuff.  There wasn't a parent alive that didn't think twice about putting their kid in front of a  Bugs Bunny cartoon.  They didn't think that, oh my God, this is crazy, violent shit going on. 
[01:00:30]  They didn't think twice about it.  I think because it's so unrealistic that a rabbit would pull a shotgun into a duck's  face and his bill would flop over.  It just feels, I just think it felt different.  But the thought is there, you know, he's picking up a weapon and shooting somebody else.  Yeah.  Yeah, sure, it's in cartoons.  Bugs had a personality and you didn't think of him as a rabbit.  That's true.  He was just a smart-ass-y guy.  He had rabbit-ality.  Yeah.  Like when I was a kid and I said cat-nality.  I said my cat had cat-nality instead of personality. 
[01:01:00]  I was a boy.  So Chip came out very early in here.  He really did.  Yeah, I know.  I should say pussy-nality.  Let's see.  Pussy.  Damn it.  If people kill me on this to the feedback, they're probably disagreeing vehemently.  That's what they do.  If one person calls up and says, I'm not saying.  He wants to debate Jimmy on school shootings.  Can I hear his point?  One point of view.  Yeah, but let's see if he's got.  Because I'm not, there's nothing to debate.  I'm not saying that it's all video games at all. 
[01:01:30]  Jimmy James, less parenting.  I think that's more of a problem.  I agree.  Forcing both parents to have to work.  I mean, if both parents want to work, that's one thing.  But now both parents have to work just to make ends meet.  That's a much bigger fucking issue than violent video games.  I agree.  But why take that on, right?  Yes, sir.  That's very complicated.  I agree, dude.  Brad in Indiana.  Hey, guys.  Hey, Jimmy.  Hi, buddy.  You guys.  Love you guys a show, but.  Of course you do.  Part of the thing, too, about more school shootings, you've got to remember, too, 30 years ago, 
[01:02:00]  there was no internet.  There was no instant communication.  Right.  So you hear about this more and more.  I mean, it's instant gratification as far as news.  The other aspect about it is, too, you've got to remember, when we were growing up,  our parents knew exactly what was going on in that house.  Sure.  And if you were wrong, you got your ass stomped.  You know, you went to a school, and, you know, teachers could swat you.  I mean, you know, if you got in trouble and stuff like that.  Which, well, like when I was a kid, I got swats all the time. 
[01:02:30]  And I didn't care.  But please, God, don't call home.  Because if you call my house, you know, all hell's going to break loose.  Because, you know, in our day and age, your parents, I mean, you ate dinner together for the most part.  You know, you had a little bit of family functions.  But, you know, and just like Anthony was saying, we ran around all the time playing guns and stuff like that.  But the neighbors also knew whose kid you were, what was going on.  You know, kind of the old atmosphere of the neighborhood. 
[01:03:00]  It was more of a, kind of a, yeah, other people were looking out for other people's family and shit like that.  But you know how you said the internet is kind of a new thing?  Really, really believably graphic.  By graphics, I mean, not violent.  I mean, just the technology.  First person shooter games are very, very, they're new.  I mean, like really realistic ones are in the last 10 years, last 15 years.  So it's like, I just think it's a component. 
[01:03:30]  I just think it's one piece.  I don't think it's the whole problem.  But I understand what this guy's saying.  Like, years ago, before CNN, before the advent of the 24-hour national, international news,  I don't know if a school shooting would actually be more than a local or regional story.  To be honest with you, unless you're looking at Kent State or, you know, Texas University,  I don't, I think if a kid went into a school with a gun and shot some students, 
[01:04:00]  I don't think it would have been an international story.  Oh, I think that was always news.  At least being the printed news, if not.  Yeah, it probably would.  But who the fuck is, eh.  Now it's put up there, you've got 20 different channels covering it from 20 different angles.  And they want to, let me go with your point.  They want to go with violent video games causing school shootings, let's say, okay?  But I think what causes more school shootings is the fact that it's put on, it's, what's the word I'm looking for? 
[01:04:30]  Glorified.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  In the media.  Yeah.  And then you've got a kid that wants a little attention and wants to make a name for himself.  Like, fuck, all I have to do is walk into a school with a gun.  You know, you can write your manifesto and it's going to be smeared all over every channel.  Right.  You know, the media should not cover it as much as they do.  Now, Sam has a stat, which they always did exist.  I'm not saying school shootings. 
[01:05:00]  Does it get any worse or is that absolutely not true?  Because what happens is, go back to 1968, you can see that they existed.  And there was, um...  Oh, Jesus, 66.  Oh, that was Austin, Texas.  16 victims and one.  That's the University of Texas.  That wasn't a student, though.  That's...  That's...  Was that Charles Wittman?  And he was a Marine!  So go down a little bit.  Was that the clock tower guy?  Yes.  Yeah.  Walt Whitman.  All right.  Not Walt Whitman, sir.  Walt Whitman, yes.  He killed him with poetry.  You sure did, by the way.  All right. 
[01:05:30]  Hold on.  What a snooze fest.  I think we can put you on hold or maybe hang up on this gentleman.  Get out a little bit.  Keeps yapping.  We're trying to see if over the years it's gotten any worse.  Yeah.  And in the 90s, there was always like one a year.  Oh, no, there's a few a year.  93, 93, 93.  I wish we had them by year.  It would be a lot easier.  Cleveland schools, you know, that's 90 to 60.  See, I wish they were done by year because you'll have like 96, 96, 96, 96, 96 number of victims.  And you could see in the 90s, it's starting to get more.  All right.  Well, you got Columbine was a biggie.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's 13. 
[01:06:00]  But the number of different instances as opposed to victims.  Because if there's five different instances, one victim each, that to me is worse than one instance of 16 victims because that's just how many the one guy got.  Let me go back to my point.  When did it come about where both parents had to be out of the house working?  Probably around the same time.  It's probably a combination.  But see, that's what my other point was, too.  What?  We didn't even hear your first fucking point.  Sorry, Brad.  Go ahead.  Go ahead, Brad.  I'm thinking about the beating.  Sorry about that.  Go ahead, Brad. 
[01:06:30]  Go ahead, Brad.  Take them to school shootings.  Now we'll go into workplace shootings.  If you look at it from that aspect, we're all basically about the same age.  Okay.  If you look at it from the time that they took away the power, basically the parents, you can't discipline your kids.  I mean, you can't swat your parents.  And I'm not talking about kicking the shit out of your kid and throwing them through the wall.  And then it's also taking the power out of the schools because now the schools can't discipline the kids anymore or the parents are allowed to sue the schools and all this bullshit.  If you look at that generation, it's not our generation that's walking into these workplaces because you got fired because you're a shithead and you don't know how to shake fries. 
[01:07:00]  Or you get depressed because somebody's picking on you.  We all got picked on when we were kids.  You know, you went across the street, you beat each other up, and then basically you're kind of semi-friends.  But see, you were allowed to stand up for yourself as a child then.  Yeah, but don't forget, you were to a certain degree, but there's a lot of pieces of shit walking around in our age group that may not be school shooters. 
[01:07:30]  But let's not look back on it like, you know, when we were growing up, a little bullying was healthy.  We had people growing up who were tortured, bullied.  They just didn't have access to a weapon.  And maybe the two parents being home really does make a huge difference.  But let's not act like everybody in our age group.  There's a lot of fucking cocksuckers in our age group.  And look at the nerds in our age group have changed the world.  The no-pussy-get-nerds, the Bill Gateses, the Steve Jobs.  I mean, you know, they weren't, I'm not saying bullied, but they were probably kind of awkward and geeky and shitty growing up. 
[01:08:00]  Dorky, yeah.  So we have had our share of horrendous people.  Yep.  I don't mean to make them horrendous, but it does get more, right, as years go on.  All right, brother.  All right, man, love you guys.  Okay, brother.  All right, brother.  Apple charger, Mac, phone, iPhone.  Oh, boy.  I got some stuff.  I don't have one.  You don't have an iPhone charger.  Oh, how?  Does Danny have one?  Probably does, yeah.  iPad charger, same as the iPhone charger is. 
[01:08:30]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  All right, I can help you out a little bit.  Thank you.  Hey, why don't we take a break?  Oh, yeah.  We got shit to talk about before our first guest gets shied.  Bird's coming.  Bird's coming.  Bird's coming.  Bird's coming, man.  Yeah.  Yeah, guy I know for a long time.  Yeah, I'm looking forward to talking to him.  And then we got Linda Hogan later.  I don't know, yeah.  And then we got it.  Who's going to give her the question about the warrior?  Just bring up the meeting before she comes in, and I'll have no problem doing it.  Oh, that is good.  That's a good idea.  What? 
[01:09:00]  I have a couple good questions.  Oh, first?  No, good questions.  You want to ask him good boy question before the naughty boy question?  Yeah?  He have him good boy question and a naughty boy question.  Naughty boy question and a good boy question.  Jesus.  We're going to talk about Michelle Bachman when we get back.  Who is that bitch?  Some dope that thinks she could be president.  She's ahead in the polls. 
[01:09:30]  Good for her.  Like one, but...  She doesn't have a shot.  I think the media is just...  Well, I made the point on Hannity last night.  How was it?  The media is just giving her a lot more attention than the other candidates right now.  Yeah, that's all that is.  Yeah, it's a popularity contest.  Hannity was fun, yeah.  I had a great time, man.  That was a lot of fun.  Let's talk about it.  I saw Bristol Palin.  She was there.  Did you get to squeeze her boobies?  A little Bristol Palin.  She's got nice boobies, right?  She had a hair...  Her hair was weird.  It looked like Snooki.  Did you get a picture?  No.  Why? 
[01:10:00]  Did you meet her?  Because I actually had to go into makeup, and then I got a picture with that ghoul, Dr.  Bodden.  Oh, Bodden was on?  No, he was just walking the hallways of Fox like a ghoul.  What?  I guess because of the Casey Anthony thing.  Well...  He's, uh...  See, she looks good there.  She doesn't look like that anymore.  She fucked up her face.  I always thought she was, uh...  She looks cute like that.  Now she's got, like...  I don't know what's going on.  She fucked up her face, man.  What did she do?  She did this, like...  She was in makeup, and she was sitting in the chair, and she... 
[01:10:30]  She got, like, snooki hair.  Did she get a nose job?  She got a nose job, absolutely, and then she got all sorts of other shit done.  She's too young to start doing that crap.  She was a cute girl.  Now she's got that basic Hollywood face now.  Yeah, it looks a little weird.  That you've seen a million fucking times.  And she was just kind of like, yeah...  What a horrible fucking parent.  She looks like a young fucking Hillary.  She was leaving the chair that I was sitting in, so I went into the studio, and she's getting  out of the chair, and I went, oh...  Sniff the seat, please.  Yeah, yeah, I just went...  Nice.  Old school. 
[01:11:00]  And I was like, hi, good job, you know?  I was watching the interview inside, and she was just like, thanks.  And then she just slowly, like, turned and Stepford-wived her way out of the studio.  It was weird.  Maybe because she's been beaten up by the...  Maybe because...  Yeah, maybe.  I don't know.  There's no reason.  Or maybe she's rotten.  I don't know.  Maybe she's rotten.  There's no reason she should be doing any media.  What does she have to offer?  She's got a book.  She's got a book.  What's it called?  It's, you know...  How I fucked up my face.  It's about her little life and what she did. 
[01:11:30]  Yeah, the bottom is what she looks like now.  My opinion?  I think Sarah Palin's a shitty parent.  Really?  Yeah.  Why would you let your kid have major face work?  How old is she?  I don't know, but...  I know she's an adult, technically, but she's still kind of just a kid.  That isn't even the picture.  Go to the other picture.  Go back.  And the bottom one.  No.  No.  Over...  Yeah, that one.  That's not her.  What is that?  That's not the new her.  I'm telling you, that's not the new her.  She fucked up her face. 
[01:12:00]  That looks like the new her.  Tell you that much.  Yeah.  That's what she looked like.  And I think that's a publicity shot for the book.  No, you gotta get a before and after.  She looks a little heavier.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Definitely a little heavier.  She's one of those girls that looks better with a few pounds on her.  I don't know.  Just a few.  Dude, she was skinnier in the before pic.  Look at her face.  Give me a before and after.  I'm telling you, she fucked up her...  Look at that.  Yeah, see?  What the fuck?  Why would you do that to yourself?  Which one is the original her?  On the left.  She's just cute.  She's adorable.  On the right, she looks better. 
[01:12:30]  Well, she likes the makeup on.  Oh my God, she looks much better on the right.  Wow.  She looks very generic.  I'm fucking wrong.  You like her better on the left when you're with her little moping?  She's a natural girl on the left.  Mopey.  The right is like porn star slash I'm ready for Hollywood bullshit.  I'd love to date her.  Hey, BP, what you doing?  Get over here.  Come here.  She got a nose job.  Her chin's different.  Her cheeks are different.  She lost some of the baby fat.  I think she had lipo on her underside of her chin.  I should do that.  You want to do that?  I do. 
[01:13:00]  She had her chin chiseled.  Something.  Yeah, yeah.  It's very pointy.  Why would you do that?  That's dumb.  She had a nose job.  She was a good looking natural blood.  Maybe cheeks.  There's something with her cheeks.  I don't know.  That's weird.  No, they did the whole list of things she got done.  Oh, they did?  Really?  It was extensive.  Wow.  I think she looks cute now.  I like the way she looks.  Wow, really, man?  Yeah, I like it.  I would go for the girl on the left in a second before the one on the right.  Oh, God, no.  Every fucking time I would.  Absolutely.  Oh, no.  She looked like a mope.  She was in that makeup chair for a long fucking time. 
[01:13:30]  Exactly.  Holy shit.  Exactly.  So there's a lumpy McGillicuddy on the left.  On the right, it's Hollywood.  Lump McGillicuddy or Hollywood.  Why don't we do something here?  Day in O&A history.  Why not?  Oh.  Let's see what happened.  What happened?  On this day.  How long ago were we going to look at you, think?  I don't fucking know.  All right.  Lots to do when we get broke.  We haven't talked about this Go the Fuck to Sleep book yet.  This children's book. 
[01:14:00]  Oh, right.  Yeah.  We had some sound.  Of course, some dumb broad has a problem with it.  Oh, why wouldn't she?  And of course, CNN is all over it.  So.  Well, they're not covering Tot Mom.  That Nancy Grace on CNN is the worst thing I've ever seen.  She's fucking horrendous.  She is a terrible person.  I hate it.  And she's trying to get something going by calling Casey Anthony Tot Mom.  Every two seconds, she's like, and Tot Mom, the defense for Tot Mom. 
[01:14:30]  And she's trying to make this like her own saying.  Well, I kind of enjoy a catchphrase every once in a while.  Oh, I hate catchphrases.  You know, when she went to one of the lawyers and said, hey, brother man, brother man.  Brother man, brother man.  I didn't like that.  But she keeps calling her Tot Mom.  She's just a hater.  She's a hack.  Nancy Grace is a fucking.  She is a hack.  You know who she looks like?  She looks like the guy from Strikeforce with who beat Fedor with giant. 
[01:15:00]  The giant.  Who's the giant?  Oh, that big lunk.  Shit.  That big, ugly lunk.  Oh, she looks like him.  And she was, and this said yesterday, and Casey Anthony was playing that courtroom like  a fiddle.  Oh, did she say that?  She said that.  What a fucking hack she is.  And by the way, I made a mistake.  I said Casey Anthony.  She never says that.  She just calls her Tot Mom.  Tot Mom. 
[01:15:30]  Tot Mom.  Shut up with your trying to make a catchphrase.  Unless you are a fiddler.  Fiddler.  Fiddler.  Who plays things, then it, what am I talking about?  What am I saying?  She's played him like a fiddle.  I hate that.  Ah, doodly, doodly, doodly.  Yeah.  I'm a terrible fiddler.  If I played something like a fiddle, I'd ruin it.  Does she want to be hateable?  Because she's very hateable.  No, she thinks she's getting things done.  No, she's hateable.  She thinks she's as tough as nails and asks the tough questions.  Her dopey fucking hair.  Casey Anthony with her, I don't want to be a pirate shirt. 
[01:16:00]  Yesterday, she's wearing the puffy shirt from Seinfeld.  Because she's trying to show the world she's crazy now, I guess, right?  Yeah, and then she was making crazy-ass faces.  Her eyebrows are going up and down.  She's smiling.  Then she's pissed off.  She's hateable.  How hot was that for you?  It was great.  At one point, she yelled at somebody and then got real quiet and put her head down because  her lawyer was like, what the fuck are you doing?  I'll start yelling at people in the courtroom, you lunatic.  I'm like, she's batshit crazy.  I love her.  Love tot mom. 
[01:16:30]  Oh, my God.  What happened, Mom?  Fuck yeah, Dave.  God, you might get phone call of the day.  Get ready for this?  You better get ready.  Sounds like a pile of shit.  Well, that is true.  You better get ready, Sam, because I'm sitting here looking at Nancy Grace going, who the  fuck does she look like?  Yeah, I think you're right.  Dave in Cleveland, go ahead, sir.  It's Dan in Cleveland.  Whatever.  Dan, all right.  She looks like David Bowie in the movie Labyrinth.  Labyrinth.  David Bowie in Labyrinth.  Oh, my God.  Oh, they've done it already online. 
[01:17:00]  They did it already.  They did it.  There's a split screen, so you click on that.  That's funny.  Oh, and Dan's gone.  Perfect phone call of the day, Sam.  Perfect.  Announce that at 10 o'clock, please.  Wow, that is good.  No one's beating that shit.  That was good.  All right, why don't we see what happened in history on this day?  Oh, my God.  Space creatures.  Oh, it's Bernard McGurk.  He doesn't look like a gray.  He glasses.  Fucking Bernard did very well hosting his own little show when you did it. 
[01:17:30]  Yeah.  I heard your segment, and, man, Bernard knows what he's doing.  He's great.  Good for him.  We had a very nice time on the phone.  Yep.  I hope he – I didn't know McCord was – I talked to Tony Powell, who's a buddy of  mine from IMIS, and I didn't know that Charles McCord left.  I just – to people who don't know IMIS, you don't give a shit, but I grew up with  Charles McCord.  He was done.  I didn't know that, though.  He just said, fuck it.  Fuck it.  I want to retire.  He's, like, from a faraway land, and he just left. 
[01:18:00]  Is that IMIS's hair?  He's not a New York guy.  He just left.  Is that really his hair?  Yeah.  God.  Charles McCord has the best head of hair for a 102-year-old man.  He's got a shitty prostate, but his hair is –  Oh, yeah.  His hair is a home run.  Yeah.  Kind of love that, huh?  Look at him.  He's waving it around.  I know.  It's curly locks.  He really is.  Very Tanner Boyle-ish.  Bastard.  Fucker.  Yeah.  Who's he thinking?  He is King Arthur?  Nice fucking Knights of the Round Table hairdo.  He does have Knights of the Round Table hair. 
[01:18:30]  He should be putting on armor and smiting someone.  This is a morning program.  Swing some mace.  Yeah.  I'm guarding the cup Jesus drank out of.  Night.  Yeah.  Did you see what Bob Kelly tweeted yesterday speaking of hair?  No.  Oh, my God.  Blubby.  He was in a movie called Eddie's Place, I think.  Orca.  Oh.  A movie that didn't do well in 1997, I believe. 
[01:19:00]  Orca.  Is that it?  Yeah.  Last Night at Eddie's from 1997.  Have you seen this ever, Jimmy?  You've been friends with Bobby forever.  Wait till you see what Bob Kelly used to look like in 1997.  I know what he looks like.  I do him then.  Last Night at Eddie's.  That's him.  What?  It ain't just that it's cheap.  They'll show him a lot in about another 20 seconds.  That's Bob Kelly.  Holy shit.  Look at him.  That's Bob Kelly.  He's a young go-getter. 
[01:19:30]  Look, he's all, like, in shape.  With a full head of black curly hair.  What the fuck movie is this?  It looked like it was a movie that was supposed to almost do well.  Yeah.  Like, it looks like some indie kind of a...  Oh, tits.  Ass.  Oh, nice ass.  I bet you Bob fucked half these girls, too.  They're going to show Bobby for a good 20 seconds in a row here. 
[01:20:00]  It's coming up.  It looks like my breasts.  Somewhere around here.  Help you, sir.  Meat.  If it's your goal.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, he looks like a pharaoh.  He looks like a pharaoh.  He looks like pharaoh.  King dunce.  You can't make fun of him, though, man.  That guy got a lot of pussy.  Dude, I fucking lived with him watching him fuck every waitress that I liked.  I can't believe that's the same guy. 
[01:20:30]  Yeah.  He's wearing, like, a shirt where the neck is kind of cut out a little too big.  He's in good shape.  It's very 90s.  Yeah.  He can't weigh more than 170, I would say.  This is, like, the whole era of, like, Kevin Smith movies and Pulp Fiction, very 90s indie  look to the movie.  Yeah.  And young Bob Kelly with pharaoh hair.  Last night at Eddie's starring the Sphinx.  That idiot looks like the fucking Sphinx. 
[01:21:00]  Hold on.  Let me take a picture.  How about the stinks?  I think you get a little acting.  Oh, yeah.  Let's see.  Let's see.  Oh, yeah.  First, get a picture of that.  Wow.  This fucking, wow.  He is, uh, he's all tan.  Oh, God damn that's thought of me.  I guess we did this break.  Seth in Illinois.  I just listened to the 2008 episode where they played old Bob Kelly tapes, including scenes  from this movie.  Was that us?  I swear I would have remembered seeing the young Robert Kelly in this.  I remember Bobby from this time. 
[01:21:30]  If I don't get this iPhone.  We can only remember so much.  We've done a lot of shows.  Yeah.  Cut us some slack.  How many shows do you think we've done?  2,835,375.4, Gregory.  Oh, yes, because we're not quite done with this one yet.  Someone should figure it out.  We've been pretty much full-time for 17 years.  Yeah.  Well, you've got to take the two years, three months off if someone really wants to get  into that.  That's true.  That's true.  That knocks us down to about 14 years, nine months of full-time radio. 
[01:22:00]  And a basic vacation schedule, to be honest with you.  Take a full year off for vacations.  Oh, yeah.  Over the course.  Oh, yeah.  Really?  You think that's fair?  Hell, yeah.  Another whole year of just days off.  Most of our career, we did only about four weeks vacation a year.  Most of it.  And then some holidays.  Someone could figure it out.  Yeah.  Give me a number about.  How many fucking shows have we done?  Hit this.  I want to see if Bob Kelly's acting.  Yeah, let's see if Bob Kelly's acting here.  Get after it.  Otherwise, you are never going to find what it is you came for. 
[01:22:30]  You'll always leave, and you'll never say goodbye.  You have a fucking profile.  Because that's who you are.  I said, watch her.  He looks like a girl.  That's Bob?  Go back.  He did look like a chick.  That's the picture you need to tweet.  What the fuck was that?  Okay, hold on.  That's the picture you need to tweet.  Go back.  Holy shit.  No, not yet.  Not yet.  Never say goodbye.  Because that's who you are.  There.  He looks like an old housewife.  Holy fucking shit.  That hair from behind makes him look like a girl. 
[01:23:00]  It looks like Lady Di.  And then he's got one earring that's hanging down.  You can't see his face.  You would swear that's a woman.  And it looks like the guy's going to go up and kiss him.  Right.  Oh, my.  What a fucking lady.  Hey, Ethel.  Ethel Kelly.  He did have, like, really.  He had a lot of hair, but I bet he hated it.  Because it was too frizzy.  No, he probably thought it was really cool.  He had to go with the soul glow.  He keeps saying, I'm thinking about growing my hair back.  Trust me.  He wants his hair back.  You know what, Dad?  You grow your hair. 
[01:23:30]  Boom, you lose.  It was never yours to begin with.  You know what, Dad?  If it falls on the floor and it never comes back, Dad, you let it go.  So what?  Approximately 3,700 shows.  Is that the number that's coming in?  That's it?  How about that, huh?  3,700 shows.  That makes sense.  Yeah, we won't make it to 5,000, unfortunately.  Why?  What?  Gregorio.  That's a lot of shows.  Oh, my God.  1,300 shows. 
[01:24:00]  That's years.  That's years.  That is years, yeah.  That's like, you know, six years, probably.  Someone says, I think it was 3,699.  Well, your math is all.  One show.  Is that about right?  3,700?  Give or take 100 shows?  Yeah, if you do...  It's not bad.  52 times...  Yep.  Someone says 42,900 shows.  42,000?  Fucking assholes.  Who's that?  What is it, one show, four servings?  So you get it? 
[01:24:30]  No.  Oh, boy.  I sure did.  All right.  This Day in O&A History, because we've got to get ready for our first guest.  Yeah.  I hope we squeeze in a few things before we do that.  Yeah.  But first this.  The Opie and Anthony Show presents...  Presents...  This Day in O&A.  In O&A.  Our favorite moments from this very day in Opie and Anthony history.  It was This Day in O&A, four years ago, in 2007, the sex man, Eric Nagel, failed to win the infamous Dr. Ian Smith bet.  He was supposed to lose 20 pounds in six weeks. 
[01:25:00]  He did not.  If you're 194, you get to keep the $500 Dr. Ian Smith already gave you.  If not, you've got to give him back to 500 plus what?  200?  Plus 100.  Oh, 100.  Okay.  All right.  Let's get this over with.  I get on the scale.  Here he goes.  Oh, he's disrobing.  Wow.  Get down to your underwear, dumbbell.  You know what?  It's so obvious he did it.  Why?  He's cocky.  He's very cocky all morning long.  I hope you guys fix the scale.  And here he goes. 
[01:25:30]  Take your shirt off.  What's the matter with you?  So every pound, this is 600 bucks.  He's on the scale.  Steve pressed on his shoulders.  And then put his...  Wait a minute.  ...in his...  If he weighs 189, I owe him $200?  How'd that happen?  You have to write everything down, Travis?  People forgot.  I totally forgot.  He's a creep.  It's a personal check.  Did I take that off?  It doesn't come out of the community account.  All right.  All right.  I didn't bet this bozo.  You're onto that gag filing?  Yeah.  Finally onto it. 
[01:26:00]  I'm paying my best through the account that Aunt and I solved.  Yeah.  I agree.  That Aunt and I solved.  Jeez.  That Aunt and I share.  We share.  All right.  E-Rock.  So you have to weigh what?  194.  All right.  Get on the scale.  E-Rock's on the scale.  This is exciting.  What a way to end...  And...  He did.  He must have done it because they're all cheering.  They're all jumping around.  What?  196.  196.  Fats all losers. 
[01:26:30]  This has been This Day in O&A.  In O&A.  Our favorite moments from this very day in O.P. and Anthony history.  The O.P. and Anthony's show.  Sirius.  Sirius.  XM.  The virus.  The virus.  The O.P. and Anthony's show.  Back with the O&A show. 
[01:27:00]  Thanks for checking us out today.  Hi.  A little over two hours and then it's meeting time.  Oh, boy.  The Countdown.  Great.  Where's Jimmy?  Jimmy went to go get an autograph.  Oh.  Yep.  He's got a picture.  Did you get it?  I didn't see him.  No.  He's somewhere.  Wait.  He's in the building?  The Fonz is in the building?  Eee.  I have a good picture with him.  But I just want to get him to sign it.  Yeah.  But I missed because Spencer said he's coming up right now. 
[01:27:30]  But I had to come in and get the photo because I didn't know he was in the show.  So where'd he go?  I don't know.  I'm looking for Spencer all over.  He's here somewhere.  What show is he doing?  He's doing a bunch of them.  We tried to get him, but he won't do any.  They said he was very nice about it, but he's like, he's afraid of all the shots.  What if we promised that we won't do anything crazy with him?  And then he knew we had Brooke Shields.  I think he's just nervous about this kind of thing.  Is he doing BT in the morning?  BT.  What's that?  BT in the morning.  No.  No.  No.  He's actually a big fan, but he's doing. 
[01:28:00]  Oh, Jesus.  No.  BT in the morning.  No.  You asshole.  You're like, Bill Zedley.  Come on.  I just got to get him to sign it, but I don't want him to use cardboard, because it fucks  up when they sign on cardboard, because the...  Oh, you get the, yeah, the little corrugation.  So how's it going to be...  Where is he going to sign?  Where's Roland?  I don't know, Opie.  I got to find something.  You're panicking.  Where's Bert?  No one's helping me. 
[01:28:30]  Where's the Conqueror?  Where's Bert the Conqueror?  Is Bert here?  Yeah, he's right outside the door.  You should use...  Put a newspaper over the cardboard.  Nah, it'll still fuck up, but thank you.  What a dumb idea.  Hey, Bert.  What's up, brother?  How you guys doing?  There he is.  Hey, man.  What the fuck is this?  Take a seat there, Bert.  Oh, juice.  Thanks, Roland.  You know what I say?  Oh.  Obviously, you're...  Hey, Roland.  Why is your voice sound all gravelly?  I don't know.  I don't know!  Jets, Jets!  Jets, Jets, Jets.  You wore that shirt just the other day?  I did a Nagel. 
[01:29:00]  I woke up at seven.  Oh, shit.  Oh, there he is.  A Nagel.  Yeah.  Did your alarm screw up, or did you lose power, or both?  I did exercise for the first time in 20 years, and this fat ass passed out.  What'd you do?  Wow.  The bite.  You know people die from that, right?  No.  Yeah.  Like, not working it up 20 years.  And then you just start working out, and it's like, yeah.  Yeah, you gotta start slow.  That's the only sound of a heart attack happens at the gym.  I remember.  Because it knocks some of that plaque off your arteries, and then clogs some shit up. 
[01:29:30]  I went home, passed out, and then I woke up at 7, like, 7.10, 7.15.  Wow.  You beat the shit out of yourself.  You literally passed out and then woke back up?  Yeah.  Like, your body did a snooze alarm on you?  Yeah, and I just woke up, and then...  Which means you're not working out anytime soon, huh?  You're gonna have to take a couple days off now.  I don't feel sore.  I feel, like, more refreshed.  I slept in.  That's fantastic.  Oh, because of the sleep part, not the workout part.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's perfect.  That's perfect.  Roland tweeted me last night. 
[01:30:00]  I was with...  You guys know Cowhead, right?  Yes.  I was with Cowhead drinking, and...  Is he here in New York?  Yeah, he just left this morning.  How old is he doing up here?  He came up to see me do Letterman.  Oh, what, you guys are old friends?  Yeah, I've known Cow since...  He's a good guy, man.  For a really long time.  He should have came by and said hi then.  He was going to.  He was gonna change his flight, and then he was like,  ah, he's gotta go back and do radio this afternoon.  How was Letterman?  It was awesome, dude.  It was so surreal.  It's so bizarre when you get him to laugh and do a Dave-ism. 
[01:30:30]  Like, when he does that, like, smirk to camera, like...  Like, one of those.  And you're sitting there.  Like, when I sat...  I literally, when I sat down on the thing,  I started giggling, because I was like,  holy shit, this is really fucking happening.  Yeah.  Like, you just...  It's such a benchmark in your career.  The first time...  Yeah, that is a fucked up thing.  And he does one of his bits,  and you get him to do one of his bits.  Yeah.  He's like, ah, you're one of these guys, huh?  And you're like, fuck!  Holy shit!  Did he do that to me?  What the fuck is going on?  Yeah, it's like being...  It's like fucking a porn star,  and then being like, 
[01:31:00]  oh my god, I'm really gonna blow a loader in her chest.  That's probably a bad analogy  that Travel Channel would hate,  but that's exactly what it feels like.  I don't know what the hell.  When you stand in the back there,  and he's like,  ah, ladies and gentlemen,  our next guest,  and you're just...  And all the guys that you've seen  as characters on the show,  the black guy,  and the guy with the red hair,  and you're like,  holy shit, they're real!  They really have jobs!  I know, that's fucked up, man.  It's so bizarre!  And then you walk out,  and you think,  how am I gonna walk?  Should I look at the audience and wait?  Yeah, should I do it?  Oh, exactly!  Oh, fucking exactly!  It's like,  Jim is the perfect body of this moment, 
[01:31:30]  is that you're very real  in those, like,  those, like,  I'm not famous,  but I should wave to the people.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!  You embody that,  because you're very honest  about that moment,  but a lot of guys, like,  are, like, bullshit.  Like, a lot of guys would go out  and be like,  hey!  Like, paparazzi was waiting outside,  and I got out of my car  in a white t-shirt  that I was sweating in,  and jeans,  and they're like,  hey, turn here!  And I was like,  you don't want to fucking see me.  You're waiting for Shia LaBeouf.  So I walked out,  I just walked out  like a fucking serial killer  right to the chair  and sat down.  And then you sit down, 
[01:32:00]  and for some reason,  I was compelled  when I sat down  to just go,  hey, Dave!  Yeah!  Like, it's like,  hey, Dave!  Did you want to look at Paul?  And go, hey, Paul!  Like, I wanted to see that shit!  All you realize you're doing  is an imitation  of everyone you've seen!  Dude, it's hilarious!  You're just like  the A-listers  that do the show.  It's like, yeah,  I earned this, motherfucker!  I earned this!  When inside,  you're like,  you don't want me  to be on that couch.  And then it wraps,  and then it wraps,  and you're done, 
[01:32:30]  and you want to lean over  and have the moment  where it's like,  the music's playing,  they're going to commercial.  I think I did that  just to make it look like that.  Because the people at home,  they don't know.  So you lean over,  and you're like,  hey,  so you're going to commercial, huh?  Just to make it look that way.  And I did realize  all I was doing  was an imitation  of everyone I've seen  on Carson,  on Letterman,  on every other guy.  Mimicking from when I was a kid.  We had to walk out,  and there were tennis balls  all over the fucking stage.  I saw you got y'all's appearance.  You had a walk.  Oh, yeah.  And we dressed up in suits. 
[01:33:00]  That was the one thing  they were like,  what are you going to wear?  And Cal Head called me,  he's like,  do not wear a fucking suit.  Don't wear a fucking suit.  You've never worn a suit  in your life.  He's like,  go like you're on stage,  wear a t-shirt,  jeans, and your boots.  And I was like,  yeah.  So I packed it,  and my wife's like,  who the fuck do you think  you are,  Johnny Depp?  Get a collared fucking shirt  and pack a collared fucking shirt.  You slob.  What are you doing?  I showed up with four collared shirts  because I was like,  I don't know which one  will look good.  Yeah.  Oh, I was such an amateur.  No, who loves you over there  is Justin loves you. 
[01:33:30]  Oh, Justin's ass.  Justin's emailing me.  He's like,  you have to have Bert on the show.  I'm like,  we're going to have Bert  on the show.  Relax.  Justin was amazing.  Just a good fit for us,  Bert, the conqueror.  I met him through Cal.  Yeah, he's very cool.  Oh, one of the fucking greatest guys,  him and his brother.  Yeah.  Solid dudes.  They told me,  they're like,  so these are the talking points  that you're going to do.  Bizarre.  Like, Travel Channel's very,  I can think I can say  whatever I want on this show.  Yes, you can.  On this show, yeah.  They're very micromanaging me  because I'm a little bit  of a media nightmare. 
[01:34:00]  Like, I have a horrible  digital footprint.  Like, my first meeting  with the president,  she was like,  I typed in your name  and I saw you get  your asshole waxed.  And I was like,  yeah, yeah,  that's my funniest thing  I've ever done.  And she was like,  yeah, well, we're not,  that's not us.  We don't do that.  Wait, why did you get  your asshole waxed?  It was a long time ago.  I had a show called Hurt Bert  and I took,  I take Dangerous Man's Jobs  and that was like  what got the show.  I got a full Brazilian wax.  It's maybe the funniest thing  I've ever done  and it's before Jackass,  it's before all of that.  You did Ball Bag?  Yeah, I did the whole thing.  Wow.  I'm telling you when I say this, 
[01:34:30]  it's the funniest thing  I've ever done  but it's also when segments  were seven minutes on TV  so I get there  and the producer, Mike's like  doing a conference call  in the morning  and he's like,  so we want you to tell  about the time  you robbed a train in Russia.  We want you to tell you  about the time  that you fought a bear.  We want to tell you  about the time  that you went to Disneyland  and took acid  and then maybe we'll talk  about the show  and I can see the PR people  going, what the fuck?  Just talk about the show.  Yeah, yeah, just the show.  And so I get there  and I'm like, man,  there's a lot of material  and they're like,  it's going to be nine minutes  and I was like, holy shit. 
[01:35:00]  And then Shia LaBeouf goes long  and they're like,  well, it depends  it's however long Dave wants.  Oh, shit.  But I was so nervous  I had to tell all these stories  that I've never,  like, on national television  and then Dave just fucking  so comfortable.  He's like,  yeah, he must have been loving it.  Hey, can you tell us  one of those stories?  Because we didn't get  to watch Letterman last night.  I didn't tell any of them.  I just told.  Oh, you didn't?  No, I ended up not.  We just ended up  talking about the show.  Why did you jump,  I read that you jumped  like out of the,  my extra girlfriend did that  where you jump off  the thing in Vegas.  I was the first person 
[01:35:30]  to do it.  Yeah, I was the very first person  to do it.  Before we go there,  I want to hear.  I was a guinea pig.  Hold on, before we go there,  though, I want to hear  about you robbing a train  in Russia.  That's crazy.  Because then we'll get  into the show  and all this crazy shit  you've done  as Bert the Conqueror.  Like, I want to know  more about Bert.  I'll tell you,  it's so fucking bizarre  because I've heard this show  so many times  and you always think,  like, what will it be like  for the first time I'm there?  And then you're like,  oh, fuck, I guess I'm telling  this Russian mob story.  So I was in, 
[01:36:00]  I was, I studied Russian  in college  just on a fluke.  I thought it was  a Spanish class  and showed up at noon  and they were introduced  to a different alphabet  and I was like,  what the fuck?  You come across  as a party animal.  How the fuck  did you take a Russian?  I was the number one  party animal in the country.  Yeah.  I like, Rolling Stone magazine  wrote an article about me,  called me the number one  party animal in the country.  So yeah, I was,  I've not fucking,  by any stretch of the means,  wanted to learn the language.  I just wanted a C.  And the lady said,  I need 14 people  to take the class.  If you stick around  and just show up,  I'll let you fucking get a C. 
[01:36:30]  I was like, done.  That's C, fuck yeah, man.  It's Florida State.  Fucking phone that shit in.  So I ended up taking,  I had to take four seasons  of Russian  because all the kids  that took it with me  were with Russian one  then needed Russian two  and three and four  and then they go to Russia  and they're like, fuck.  So this is back  when the mob ran Russia, okay?  And so they told me  on the flight over there,  like, listen,  we had to pay off the mob  to chaperone us  so that we don't get  patted down everywhere we go.  So we got two young gangsters 
[01:37:00]  that we'll meet.  They're like,  don't make eye contact with them.  Don't engage them.  Don't fucking,  and nothing.  Leave them alone.  They're just to make sure  we don't get robbed  everywhere we go.  And all I'm hearing  is fucking,  let's get to know these guys.  These are the interesting guys.  These are the guys  who I want to party with.  So the very first night,  and I don't speak any Russian,  the very first night  I got a bottle of vodka,  a six pack of Baltica,  and I knock on their door  and this guy Igor  answers the door.  Igor, yeah.  With just a wife beater  and a cigarette  and fucking track pants.  Total gangster.  And he's like,  stuh.  And I'm like,  I'm like,  all the sentences 
[01:37:30]  I had practiced in my head  just disappeared  and all I said  with a bottle of vodka  and a six pack of Baltica  was,  I am the machine.  That's all that came  out of my mouth.  And he fucking starts laughing.  He's like,  what did you say?  And I was like,  I don't know,  I'm the machine.  And he's like,  he's the machine!  And then I ended up  partying with him  and all his friends  for like an entire,  like two months,  just,  and they called me  the machine.  And so,  I mean,  we partied like crazy.  These,  fuck,  we go to,  we went to a,  I really shouldn't  tell this part, 
[01:38:00]  but we went to  like a mob boss's party  and the mob boss  was like,  I mean,  I don't know  if he was a real boss,  but he was a big guy  on the thing  and he was like,  so this is the machine!  And Igor was like,  yeah,  this is the guy  I tell you about.  And I was with  one of my teachers  who was a girl  and he goes,  tonight I say  we exchange women.  And I was like,  women?  She's just my,  okay,  all right,  sure.  Yeah,  yeah,  whatever you mean.  And he totally  ended up fucking up.  Whatever you mean.  He totally ended up.  So then,  we have to go to Moscow.  Now a different mob  runs the trains  and a different mob  runs Moscow. 
[01:38:30]  And Igor said,  I can't go with you  to Moscow.  I can't even get  on the train with you.  But I've talked to the  people that are going  to be chaperoning you  and they're cool.  They're going to party  with you.  They'll take care of you.  And sure enough,  man,  we get to the train  and the two other gangsters,  Igor and Igor,  there are not a lot  of names there,  I guess,  if you give the machine  vodka,  you'll have a blast.  And they're like,  machine does not sit  and coach with his class.  The machine sits first class.  I'm like,  this is what I'm fucking  talking about.  And I mean,  literally before we took off,  the conductor of the train 
[01:39:00]  comes into our cabin,  rips off the lapel  to his shirt,  hands it to me  and goes,  this is a present  for the machine.  It would be an honor  to do a shot with you.  I was like,  these stories have  gotten out of control.  So within 20 minutes,  we've drank all the booze  and Igor and Igor are like,  let's go to the bar cart  and get more vodka.  I was like,  sure.  So we go into the bar cart  and Big Igor's like,  machine,  go behind the bar  and grab bread.  And I was at club  and I'm like,  oh shit,  I understood what he said.  He's like,  grab seer.  And I was like,  that's cheese.  He's like,  grab vodka.  I'm like,  I know that one. 
[01:39:30]  I'm learning.  And then he's like,  grab all the money.  And I'm like,  what?  Oh shit,  wait a minute.  He's like,  grab the money.  And I look  and no one's fucking moving  and it's just him  patting down people  and I'm behind the bar  with a fucking loaf of bread,  a bottle of vodka  and I just,  I'm like,  holy shit,  we're robbing the fucking train.  So we take the money  and we go back to first class  and it is,  the energy has changed  in these guys' eyes.  You can see it's like an,  they're real gangsters.  Now it's business.  Like Igor was a pity pat gangster.  These guys,  I mean,  our teacher came back  to yell at me,  this lady Val.  She came back  and she was like,  you sir,  have, 
[01:40:00]  this is,  this is exactly,  that was inappropriate.  Big Igor takes a sip of vodka,  spits it in her face  and goes,  no one talks to the machine  like that.  He's like,  I'm like,  she does,  it's okay if she does.  He shuts the door,  I swear to you,  he then lifts up  a thing of keys  and he goes,  tonight when it gets dark  we're gonna have some real fun.  I was like,  what?  And he's like,  we're robbing the whole fucking train.  I'm like,  motherfucker,  like this has gotten him  way out of control  and sure enough man,  it gets dark  and we start fucking  breaking into cabins.  It's like a Bond movie.  It's the most insane  fucking event in my life  where you're just sitting 
[01:40:30]  watching a crime happen  and you're like,  I'm trying,  I wish I could stop it  but you're just part of it now.  So we get done,  we drink the whole night  on the train,  we pull into Moscow  and that same teacher comes up  and she's like,  the police have been alerted,  we've told the authorities,  we told you not to hang out  with these people,  it was your choice.  I don't know what to tell you  and I was like,  motherfucker  and Igor and Igor are like,  fuck her,  this is Russia,  no one tells us in Russia,  mafia runs Russia  and I'm like,  fuck you,  I'm gonna go to the gulag,  I'm gonna be a punching bag  in the gulag  and we pull up  and sure enough man,  the cops are sitting  on the platform 
[01:41:00]  with my own class  who we robbed  is sitting in their pajamas  with their passengers  bags open,  crying,  because if anyone ever woke up,  like this one Hungarian girl  woke up  and Igor just spit vodka  in her face.  So the cops are out there  taking a thing  and Igor goes,  fuck this,  I take out of this  and I'm like,  oh man,  he goes out  and mind you,  half of this is in Russian,  he goes out  and starts talking to the cop  and yelling at the cop  like,  I don't know what he's saying  but he's not like,  they're not exchanging recipes.  It wasn't bread and cheese.  Yeah, exactly  and I'm sitting in the fucking train car  with little Igor  just thinking,  oh, I'm fucked, 
[01:41:30]  I'm fucked  and then the cop starts yelling back  and they start pointing at me  like,  and I'm like,  oh, motherfucker  and then the cop looks at me  and points at me  and says,  get over here now  and I'm like,  so I walk out of the train,  walk across the thing  and it's that moment,  that like,  midnight express moment  this is the end of freedom.  This is that cold  where they find the pound of hash  on your body  and I walk up to the cop  and he looks at me  and takes a beat  and he gets right in my face  and he's like,  so I understand you're the machine.  He's like,  tonight you party with us  and I was like, 
[01:42:00]  are you fucking kidding me?  And we went out  and partied with these fucking cops.  That was it.  Yeah, it was Russia.  It was the Wild West.  It was...  Oh, by the way,  machine,  we need for you  to kill someone tonight.  They were bizarre, man.  That's like,  wait a minute.  We went to a strip club  and he's like,  he goes,  you don't drive a cop car  and I'm like,  I'm not gonna fucking drive a cop car.  It was bizarre.  There was a magazine  out at the time,  like a periodical  that used to talk  about these two guys.  I remember reading it  when I got back.  They would,  I'm sure I'm gonna exaggerate 
[01:42:30]  the story  only because it's been  in my head for so long,  but they would get a head  from a cadaver  and see,  they'd write an article about it  and they'd put it  in the middle of the car  and see how much it would cost  to get out of having a head  in the middle of the car.  I swear to you,  I don't know what it's called.  I don't know what it's called,  but these guys would write  these articles.  It was fucking insane.  How much you'd have to pay  to be like,  okay.  It's a head.  We get rid of the head.  And it was,  Russia was insane back then.  Like, insane.  What year is this?  This is 90, 
[01:43:00]  I was 22,  so probably 95, 94.  Yeah, so that's okay.  Communism gone.  They're just trying  to figure shit out.  It was the Wild West, man.  Yeah, yeah.  Like, the most insane  life experiences  you could ever have.  Stealing boats.  Like, just.  And we went over there to study.  You're a weird fit  for the Travel Channel now  that I've talked to  for a few minutes.  We did a meet and greet  at the network,  like, right after  the new regime took over.  And they're like,  and I told that Russian mob story  when I was on the X show,  like, a long,  like, 10 years ago.  And we're doing, like, 
[01:43:30]  Fred Graver's the head  of the Travel Channel,  and they're doing, like,  so tell us,  how do you interview kids?  Like, you know.  Oh, shit.  Kids love my show.  Like, I don't know why  kids are obsessed  with Birth to Conquer.  Like, if you've got a child  that's, like, four,  show them Birth to Conquer,  and he's fucking glued.  Like, and so he's like,  how do you interview kids?  Like, what's your, you know.  And then one of the young kids  is like, can you tell about  the time you robbed  the train in Russia?  And I was like, yeah, sure.  And then someone's like,  tell about the time  you thought Will Smith  was going to rape you.  And I was like,  oh, all right, sure. 
[01:44:00]  So, yeah, I'm an odd fit.  I'm not like the other guys.  But I think all those guys  are like that kind  if you party with them.  Yeah.  You know, yeah,  Adam Richman's funny as shit.  He's, damn, man.  Yeah, the Travel Channel,  well, the Travel Channel's  changed a bit over the years.  Uh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, it used to.  I mean, Bourdain was  a heroin addict, so.  Who?  Oh, does, and is that not?  No, I don't know.  No, Anthony Bourdain.  Yeah, Anthony Bourdain.  I think, I think it's pretty  well documented.  Oh, was it?  Yeah, yeah, it was a heroin addict. 
[01:44:30]  I feel like I'm fucking  just saying, damn.  I didn't know who that was.  Yeah, I'm talking about  this gig.  Wait, I get them all confused,  though.  Bourdain did what show now?  He's the older.  Oh, no reservations.  Yeah, no reservations.  And then it's Zimmern, me,  and Adam Richman.  Right, okay.  Gotcha.  And then Zach and those guys  are ghost adventurers.  Man.  Wow.  Insanity, man.  Yeah, absolutely is. 
[01:45:00]  Yeah, and so they wanted me  to tell that story.  So you were voted the number  one partier at Florida State?  Yeah.  And Florida State was named  the top party school.  Wow.  So then if you're the number  one partier in the party school,  what makes you the number  one partier?  That's fucking crazy.  I don't know.  It was kind of like one of  those just, you know how media...  Is it just alcohol or is it  drugs, too, back then?  I mean, yeah, I was in college.  Yeah.  Not even an answer.  Just, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, like, I mean, yeah.  So I partied a lot.  But then I just had 
[01:45:30]  outrageous stories.  Like, I was kind of the...  I was the guy that, like,  when you...  When I got to New York,  everyone's like,  you'll never be a comic  because you're the party guy.  Like, that guy is never  funny on stage.  Like, it's just...  Everyone always says,  if you're funny in a room,  you're usually not funny on stage.  It's the quiet guy  who's in the side of the room  thinking who's funny on stage.  That's what alternative guys think.  Yeah.  They think that because a lot of them  are not funny in real life,  well, that's what makes me special.  Yeah.  Right.  Colin's funny in person.  Keith is funny in person.  Yeah.  Oh, that's what was so confusing.  Most good comedians are funny in person. 
[01:46:00]  All the guys I gravitated with  when I moved here was, like,  Jim, Bobby Kelly, Ben Bailey,  like, DC,  and then all the black comics,  like, Tony Woods, Donnell Rollins,  because I worked at the door  at the Boston Comedy Club,  and they were all funny to be around.  I was like, well, fuck that.  Like, I don't need to go  to the East Village.  I'll just do stand-up over here.  Be cool.  Yeah, but, like,  I took a shit on a pizza box  to win an election,  and that kind of got their attention.  And I just had, like, bizarre stories.  So then they were trying  to write an article  about Florida State originally,  and it was too broad a subject, 
[01:46:30]  so then they just narrowed it down  and just wrote an article about me.  Damn.  Rolling Stone, right?  Yeah, Rolling Stone,  and then Oliver Stone  optioned the rights to my life.  I got offered, like, a book deal,  and then I did stand-up  for the first time in Tallahassee,  and it went really well.  Like, I'd never do it now  because it was,  I followed four national,  like, touring comics from Florida  who each did 20 minutes.  What a bad fuck,  in a bar.  What a bad setup, right?  And they're like,  you just closed the show.  They wanted me to fail  because they were like,  fuck this guy.  Right.  And then I went up, 
[01:47:00]  and I just didn't have any material.  I never did stand-up,  and I just kind of talked  for 20 minutes  about whatever came to my mind,  and I did really well,  and they offered me  on my own morning show  in Tallahassee.  And I was like,  are you serious?  And the guy's like,  yeah.  He's like,  you come work with me  and be my sidekick,  and then in like two months  I'm leaving,  I'm going to New York.  I go,  why aren't you staying  in Tallahassee?  He's like,  fuck,  who wants to live in Tallahassee?  I was like,  way to sell it to me.  I was like,  I'm fucking moving  to New York too,  and then moved to New York  and started doing stand-up.  But yeah,  like,  I was,  I guess I was just always loud.  Like,  just one of those, 
[01:47:30]  yeah,  and I have a,  I end up getting  into weird fucking scenarios.  So,  How many years  since you've lived in New York?  It's got to be like,  10 now.  I remember Bert,  you know,  every night I would see him  three or four times a week.  I can't believe  it's been that many years  that I saw you every night.  Yeah,  I used to work the door,  Boston Comedy is dead now,  I guess.  It's not a club anymore,  it's a restaurant.  Yeah,  it's,  those are fucking,  that seems like a lifetime ago.  Yeah,  Red Johnny and the round guy  and Chappelle.  Oh,  I see him all the time.  You see Johnny, right? 
[01:48:00]  I see Johnny all the fucking time.  And Chappelle would come by,  I remember that was like,  when Chappelle was like,  was like getting fucked  by the industry,  but he hadn't lost his mind yet.  That's fucking what I was going to say.  But you know,  everyone knows him.  I'm sure he does too.  Yeah.  But I remember him telling me  like,  I had just gotten a development deal  with Will Smith  and I was like,  really excited.  I think I remember that.  Yeah.  I remember,  those are like,  the most defining moments.  So I remember Patrice O'Neill  said the most brilliant thing to me.  We were in Scotland together  and I had gotten this deal  and I had gotten a TV show.  It was me, 
[01:48:30]  Voss,  and Patrice  living in like,  a fucking flat.  and fucking Patrice  is just genius.  Yeah.  Sitting across from me  eating blood pudding  with five eggs  and just fucking sausage and meat  and just,  you know how-  What brilliant thing did he say?  Bert,  I'm going to die  before my time.  He was like,  he was like,  you know what,  you know why I feel bad for you,  Bert?  And I was like,  I don't know.  And he was like,  just slopping it into his mouth.  He's like,  you got no foundation.  I was like, 
[01:49:00]  what do you mean?  He goes,  when all this goes away,  you go back to zero.  But until you're a comic  and you can fall back  on a career of comedy,  you got nothing.  And I was like,  in my head,  I was like,  who gives a shit?  I'm getting on a TV show.  And then sure enough,  all those TV shows went away  and I was like,  I got fucking nothing.  No,  I got nothing.  And literally,  like Jay Moore  just fucking saved my life.  I opened for him one night.  I'd never met him.  I'd met him like a couple times,  but not like didn't know him.  Met him,  opened up for him in Ontario.  KP Anderson was featuring,  I was hosting.  And after the first show Thursday, 
[01:49:30]  we did two shows Thursday,  Jay said to me,  so do you want to be like a real comic?  And I was like,  fuck yes.  And he was like,  okay.  And he was like,  KP,  we're going to switch it up.  Bert's going to feature.  And then he's like,  if you can do this  and you'll be my guy forever.  And I was like,  fuck,  I went up,  featured,  killed it.  And Jay was like,  check my schedule.  You'll just tour with me  from now on.  I was like,  damn.  Like fucking.  That was easy.  Yeah,  that was great.  Great.  I'll take a movie.  That's great.  Yeah,  so it's bizarre  coming back to New York.  I don't like it. 
[01:50:00]  Yeah,  I don't like it  as much as I used to.  Where do you live?  I live in LA.  Okay,  LA guy.  Yeah,  two kids.  LA is great  when you're working though.  It's like,  it's like every New York comic  thinks you're supposed to hate LA,  but then you go out there  and you got a gig.  It's actually fucking nice  fucking great,  isn't it?  I love living in LA now.  I've had like a month off  because we wrapped  Birth Conquer  and this other show  and I'm not going  on the road again  until like the second week,  third week of July  and it's been fucking awesome.  Just kidding.  I got a man cave.  Do you guys know 
[01:50:30]  the show Man Caves on DIY?  Yeah,  we make fun of man caves  on this show.  I fucking got one  and they're the fucking  best thing ever.  It's like shaving your pubes  for the first time.  You're like,  oh,  it does look gay,  but it's fucking awesome.  And it's the best.  I just get weird  as fucking that thing.  Kegerator,  wine refrigerator,  are you shitting me?  I'm obsessed.  I'm obsessed.  I'm fucking,  all the gay shit  I made fun of  when I was younger,  I'm like,  fuck,  I'll take it.  I'm going to do it.  Yeah,  fuck it.  Fuck it.  So you're not working right now?  No,  I'm off.  See,  this is what we were  just talking about.  I know, 
[01:51:00]  right?  Why the fuck  are we working there?  Just taking time.  Anyway,  that's something else.  Not having to deal with it.  When was the last,  but you guys take vacations.  Yeah,  we got vacations.  Yes.  And you know  you have time off.  To know you're going back.  We're pretty much  slaves to this place  right now.  You know when  you're going back.  We got some shit  to figure out down the road.  Why did you jump?  I don't know  if it's for a show.  No,  no,  no,  no.  I just wanted to get  to know him a little bit  before we start talking  about the show.  I actually didn't know  that.  I didn't know  if it was for the show  or not.  Yeah,  it was for the show.  It was the,  it was,  they had just opened it 
[01:51:30]  and we had,  it was like the first season  and they called  and they were like,  they got this new ride  in Vegas called,  it's called the Sky Jump  where you jump off  the side of the stratosphere  and you land on the ground.  It's not bungee.  And I was like,  in my head I was like,  I can't be that bad.  But I had no frame  of reference  for how big  the stratosphere was.  I mean,  it's as tall  as the Sears Tower.  So I get there  and I see it  and I start fucking  flipping out.  And then I,  the night before  I had a full blown  anxiety attack  like throwing up  at a bathtub,  like soaking wet  with sweat,  called my wife  and I was like,  I'm fucking running away. 
[01:52:00]  I'm going to,  I'm going to drive  to the middle of the desert  and not show up.  And she was like,  she's like,  you can't do that  because you're going  to sue us  for the production cost.  And she was like,  call the producer  and tell him  you just can't do it.  So I called Dan Adler,  the head of our,  one of the heads  of our shows.  I was like,  I can't do it.  And he was like,  that's fine.  He's like,  I get it.  There's going to be  things you can't do,  but I need you  not to do it  at the top.  Like I need you  to be dressed  on the edge  and then not do it.  Like if you do that,  then I can make  a show out of that.  But if you just say  at the bottom,  oh,  I can't fucking do it.  He's like,  we don't have a show. 
[01:52:30]  So I was like,  okay.  And in my head,  I'm like,  oh,  fucking easy.  I can do that.  He worked you so bad.  Oh man.  Yeah.  I got it.  I have to say,  he got you.  Yeah.  I get dressed in a suit.  Just put the head in.  That's what that was.  Right.  Right.  He's singing.  He's singing with a moccasin.  One finger,  two finger cock.  That's a smart guy right there.  So I get dressed in the outfit  and I'm like doing interviews  and I'm like,  oh.  Knowing the whole time,  I'm not doing this.  I'm not fucking doing this.  And I was like, 
[01:53:00]  throw me from your building.  And everyone's like,  yeah.  And everyone's chanting,  Bert,  Bert,  Bert.  And I get on the edge  and my camera guy,  who's obsessed with your show,  by the way,  Scott Sands,  he's literally from day one.  He's like,  what are you doing O&A?  So he listens to every fucking episode.  So he's on the side of the building,  harnessed in.  This guy's fucking a gangster.  Not afraid of anything.  And harnessed into the side of the building,  leaning off of the camera,  like this fucking big 900 camera.  And I'm on the edge  and I'm doing my reads  and I'm like,  and on my head,  I'm just like,  I'm going to back out any second now. 
[01:53:30]  And he's like,  starts giggling.  I was like,  what?  And he lowers the camera  and he's like,  there's like fucking 400 people here.  And you know what?  He's like,  the mayor's down there  with a shot of tequila.  Like,  he goes,  it would be easier for you to jump  than spend the next hour and a half  explaining why you didn't jump.  And I looked around  and there's like little kids  around the glass enclosure  like,  Bert,  Bert,  Bert.  And I looked down,  there's fucking people waiting for me.  I'm like,  holy shit.  And he goes,  dude,  it's 16 seconds  and you'll never have to fucking explain  why you didn't jump.  And I was like,  and then I just started fucking losing it.  And I was like,  fuck it,  I'm jumping. 
[01:54:00]  I'm on the top fucking jumping.  And they're like,  and everyone's like,  no,  we're not ready.  We're not ready.  Hold on.  Don't jump.  And I was like,  fuck you.  I just jumped.  And I just jumped  and it was the best feeling in the world.  Like,  I've never,  that was,  I said it on the show,  but it's better than the birth of my second child.  Like,  the first one you really remember  and then your second one you're like,  oh,  I remember that kind of.  I think I did Xanax.  We watched Uncle Buck.  And then,  but I got on the ground  and I was like,  I was alive.  There's a moment when you do these crazy fucking events,  like where you do,  like bungee jumping in LA,  we're off a bridge.  And you, 
[01:54:30]  that moment where the ride works,  where the thing works  and you don't fucking die,  where you've never felt more alive in your life.  Like,  shovel racing in New Mexico,  you just sit on a shovel  and go down a mountain  at 70 miles an hour,  like in snow.  The first part of shovel racing,  you're like,  you're like scared  and you're like,  ah,  ah,  and then all of a sudden  you get to like 40 miles an hour  and you're going good  and you're going straight  and you're like,  oh,  I'm fucking halfway down.  And you're like,  fucking charge it.  You're like,  those moments,  like I get chills thinking about it, 
[01:55:00]  but that,  the sky jump was like that.  When did it happen for the sky jump?  The minute you left  or the minute,  because you don't slow down  until you hit the fucking bottom.  No,  the minute you feel  the pulley system  starting to work.  Like,  the second you leap,  you're like,  motherfucker,  and then all of a sudden  you feel your body go parallel  and you're like,  okay,  this is working.  Do you feel like  you're being lowered or falling?  I heard it's like  a controlled descent.  It's not as intense  as like,  say like,  I did an unattached free fall,  which they don't do any,  it's illegal now,  but they take you up 
[01:55:30]  in a,  in like a,  like a fucking tower,  like a 15 story tower.  And then take,  draw you up  and there's a net underneath  and then they lower you  below the cage  in this harness  and they just pull a pin  and you fall into a net  like 12 stories.  Wow.  That was,  there's no fucking feeling  like that.  I mean,  I've sky dove,  I went skydiving  with Rachel Ray  and that was like,  cool and crazy,  but it's like,  that feeling of free fall,  you don't get that  on sky jump.  You definitely,  it's beautiful, 
[01:56:00]  it's crazy,  it's insane  and you feel,  like you definitely feel  like you're free falling  for like probably 12 seconds,  15,  16 seconds,  but it's not as intense,  like bungee jumps  is more intense  in my opinion.  When you fall into a net,  they have to tell you  how to land  so you don't fucking  drive your chin  into your fucking knee?  They don't tell you  a fucking,  that's why it's illegal now.  They literally,  I mean,  they didn't check,  that thing was so,  let me tell you something,  this fucking ride,  it's called,  I forget what it's called,  they won't even show it 
[01:56:30]  on my show anymore,  like they don't show  that episode that I did it in.  Why?  You did it.  Because a girl got hurt  and so,  but so,  this ride,  when the guy made this ride,  he was like,  this is going to take over  fucking theme parks.  This is going to be  the biggest fucking ride ever,  right?  So he goes to Vegas  to the big coaster convention  and puts it in the parking lot  and he gets his time to speak  and he goes,  ladies and gentlemen,  I'm going to revolutionize  theme parks.  I'm going to,  bungee jumps will be obsolete  when you see what I have to offer  and if you'd like,  I have a demonstration  waiting for you outside.  The fucking whole place  stands up,  walks outside  and they see this 
[01:57:00]  15 story tower  and the guy goes,  all we do  is we put a guy in that  and they start doing it  and we draw him up  and we take him up there  and we drop him  and they drop him  and they forgot to raise the net  and they killed a guy.  No.  First fucking time  when they showed  the fucking ride.  First,  talk about  fucking like,  ah,  ah.  How do you forget  to raise the net?  How did he go,  there's no net,  that's fine.  It's happened a bunch of times  like it's happened  more times  than is legal  so that's why  they shut the ride down. 
[01:57:30]  But yeah,  it was,  that's insane.  It was one of the craziest moments.  Wow,  fuck.  Bungie jumping seems like  that's great.  I can only do it once.  That's unbelievable.  Yeah,  I'm not into heights,  I can't do,  how was skydiving?  Was that really horrifying?  Yeah,  because I'm a micromanager  and like anxiety  so like I,  so like I,  I can totally get myself  into a panic attack easy  and the night before  I'm sitting,  I'm in New York,  we did it in New York  and I'm sitting in my hotel room  and I start googling  deaths  skydiving. 
[01:58:00]  Oh no,  why?  That's not gonna help.  Why?  So uncomfortably high.  Like you'd think,  what would you think  the number would be like,  five a year?  I mean like you'd think  you'd hear about them.  For the whole country?  They're fucking 40.  Like they die all the time.  The mayor of Pennsylvania,  some town in Pennsylvania  died like the week after I went.  Like it happens constantly  and so it's,  I was,  my whole fear is like,  what if the chute doesn't open?  Yeah,  yeah,  that's the biggest.  That's your thing.  That's pretty much it.  That's it. 
[01:58:30]  That's the only thing  you give a shit about  and so we,  Rachel was sitting next to me,  I haven't flown sober  in 20 years  and I'm flying sober  backwards in some dude's lap  and I'm grabbing Rachel's leg  like fucking panicked.  And she's like,  she's freaking out  like,  calm down  and then she says,  whatever you do,  don't watch me go out of the plane.  I was like,  why?  She was like,  just don't  and of course I'm like,  I'm fucking watching.  Now you're gonna watch.  You get sucked out of the plane  just like,  like in a movie  and I see that  and I start losing it  and then the guy's like,  we're next  and I'm like,  ah,  and I'm doing all the nervous 
[01:59:00]  hand things to stop  and the first drop  you feel that  it's an awesome feeling  but then there is a moment  when you're screaming  at the earth  three miles above the earth  at 120 miles an hour  where your brain says,  what if the chute doesn't open?  And then the only rational thought is,  fuck it,  like there's nothing  I can do about this moment.  Yeah,  done.  When you're falling,  how do you not,  I'm sorry,  how do you not flail and kick?  Isn't that your instinct?  You hold on to,  they tell you just hold on  to your straps  and we'll do everything.  The guy said to me,  he's like,  you can't kill us. 
[01:59:30]  Like that's what he said.  He's like,  you can't,  in my head I'm like,  I could totally fucking kill us.  I bet I could kill us.  I guarantee you  I could fucking kill us.  Oh,  was you,  he was tandem jump?  Yeah,  it was tandem.  He was hold on.  What if you punched him  and knocked him out?  I was like,  in my head,  I was like,  I can think of ten ways.  I bet I could come up  with the most original way  to kill us  that you never fucking saw come.  You're not going to do it  on purpose,  but all of a sudden  you'll lose it  because you're freaked out  and you'll knock him out.  Well,  he said,  he's like,  at like 6,000 feet  or 3,000 feet,  an emergency chute  will open.  Yeah,  it's like set on an altimeter.  Oh, 
[02:00:00]  is that how they do that?  So you don't have to pull it?  It's an emergency thing.  You have to pull it,  but there are chutes  that will open  when you hit a certain altitude  if you get knocked out.  How do you know  what the fucking height is?  You have a watch  that has an altimeter.  What if it falls off?  It's not going to fall off,  Jimmy.  No,  but these are all the thoughts  I was having  in the bed the night before.  Jimmy's innocent questions  are adorable.  But it's true.  What if your watch  fucking breaks?  Yeah,  oh,  exactly.  What if you hit a fucking bird  and you,  like,  I always think of that shit. 
[02:00:30]  Oh,  wow,  yeah,  right.  You hit a bird  and you get knocked  at 120 miles an hour.  Knock the fuck out.  It would be like  catching a foot to the face  out of a car window.  Oh,  that would fucking,  I thought of all this.  Like Fabio on the roller coaster  when the bird  hit him in the face.  That was,  talking about luck.  I know.  Hey,  can we take a break?  Yeah,  we can do that.  Could you stay,  Bert?  Yeah,  of course.  We got Linda Hogan  at nine.  Shut up.  You want to stay for that?  You can.  We're going to ask her  about the Warrior. 
[02:01:00]  We're going to ask her  some shit.  The Ultimate Warrior  was saying some really  bad things about,  like Hulk and her.  Passed around  to all the wrestlers  and we have to ask her  about it.  And it's not a wrestling work.  It's like real.  Yeah.  This guy hates  I have some very good questions.  And Jimmy's got  some good questions.  Yes,  Jimmy prepares.  Yeah,  Jimmy prepares  for interviews.  We only got the book  yesterday,  so I didn't get a chance  to read it  so I just perused.  Just read the end.  I think it ends  with a divorce.  Yeah,  yeah,  you just read the end.  Yes.  I want to find out  if Hulk  fucked 
[02:01:30]  beautiful Elizabeth.  All right.  I don't know  if she knows that.  I bet you can ask her that.  You probably do.  Do you know that?  Yeah.  That's Randy Macho Man  Savage's beef  as he went down  and Elizabeth was there  and Hulk was like naked.  Then he was like,  oh,  Elizabeth's in the other room.  Brother.  Brother.  Yeah.  I was a big wrestling.  I grew up in Florida,  man.  Wrestling was like  Huge.  And they all lived there.  Like you'd go to the matches  and see.  He grew up in Florida  and he loves wrestling.  No,  he didn't.  He rocks from Florida. 
[02:02:00]  He rocks from Florida, dude.  He rocks a Florida guy.  What?  All right.  Listen,  Bert the Conqueror  Wednesdays 10 p.m.  on the Travel Channel.  We're going to take a quick break.  Continue with Bert  and then Linda Hogan at 9,  all right?  I'm going to go out  and meet Fonzie.  Oh,  Henry Winkler's here?  Yes.  I just met him last night.  Did he?  Yeah.  He's funny as shit.  Did he do Letterman?  Yeah,  he did Letterman.  He did like their  Is This Anything game.  I saw him on a  reverse mortgage commercial  though last night.  It was kind of freaky.  Like,  oh,  it's the Fonz. 
[02:02:30]  Fonzie's not going to have  a place to live with.  Of course he is.  Then I had a tweet.  I was like,  what's next Pinky Tuscadero  in one of those  Vaginal Prolapse commercials?  Jesus.  How's your vaginal mesh?  Do you like Pinky or Leather?  I like Leather.  I hated the way she did this  though,  the fucking...  How could you not?  And the point?  That's fucking awful.  That was her thing.  Yeah,  look at that.  Leather Tuscadero.  The fucking mullet.  It was really awful.  And what were the twins?  The Malachi Crunch. 
[02:03:00]  The Malachi Crunch.  Right.  The twins were the...  The twins of Fonzie  never fucked  but always made it seem  like he was going to...  Who were they?  Fonzie never had sex  with anybody,  never fought anybody.  He was just a fucking talker.  I wonder why  he didn't want to do the show.  Believe me,  we would have brought this  all up.  No,  but that's not Henry Winkler.  It's Fonzie.  Exactly.  Let's talk about  Pat Morita had the fucking  worst gig.  Guy could speak  perfect English  and they're like,  hey,  fucking,  can you...  Can you dumb it down?  Chink it up for us.  Chink it up.  I was watching 
[02:03:30]  The Grotty Kid  the other day  and I thought to myself,  do you think at any point  Daniel's mom was like,  I think this janitor  is trying to fuck my son.  They spend a lot  of time together.  We go to break  with that.  More with  Birth to Conqueror next.  Sirius XM.  The Virus.  You're listening  to O.B. Anthony.  All right,  what's going on?  We got Linda Hogan  coming in  in about 20 minutes.  Bert Kreischer.  Oh, she's going to be 
[02:04:00]  in the fucking room?  Yeah.  Oh, that makes it  so much more uncomfortable.  Oh, I know.  It's going to be bad.  How do you say  your last name?  Kreischer.  You said it right.  Yeah?  Kreischer.  And it's Bert Kreischer  on Twitter.  K-R-E-I-S-C-H-E-R.  He's a good one to follow.  Birth to Conqueror  Wednesdays,  10 p.m.  on the Travel Channel.  I do something on Twitter.  I haven't done it in a while,  but I do something  called What Will the Maid Think  where I take pictures  and go to  BertBertBert.com  and you'll see it. 
[02:04:30]  You got BertBert.com?  Fuck!  Bert, Bert, Bert, Bert, Bert.  Bert, Bert, Bert.  Go to  blog  and I leave  the room in a way  so the maid goes,  What the fuck  happened in this room?  Oh, no.  This is literally  Oh, what a great idea.  It's fucking  it's awesome.  What the fuck is that?  That's just some pillows and a robe.  Here, go back and see the...  Holy shit, it's pillows and a robe set up to look like someone puking in the toilet.  Yeah, and then I leave the room like that. 
[02:05:00]  This one's one of my favorite.  These were the shoes from my wardrobe that day and the jeans from my wardrobe.  And then that's a lamp.  Holy shit.  These are the fucking funniest things.  You make it look like there's a dead body under the bed.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Here, go to the toilet snakes, my favorite.  I did this one at the W here.  Too bad you can't get the reaction.  How fucking great is that?  You should get a camera set up.  I should, except it's, you know...  Illegal, aren't they?  I mean, that and I, like, God forbid.  I did it, it got really big, like, it got really big in, like, Sweden. 
[02:05:30]  Really?  For some reason, like, Scandinavia fucking loved this shit.  This one's really simple and just genius.  Holy fuck, the sheet out the window tied to a chair leg.  Oh, that's great.  I literally...  So, Scandinavia exploded about this.  They, like, crashed my site, crashed everything.  That's great.  And then the Today Show got a hold of it, like, and they were calling me the world's worst  traveler.  Wow.  Yeah.  Hey, look who it is.  Hey, Henry.  I saw you last night. 
[02:06:00]  There he is.  Yeah, how you doing?  How are you?  Hello.  Hi, Henry.  How are you?  Henry.  Pleasure to meet you.  How you doing?  Good.  Yeah, you guys are funny.  Oh, thanks, man.  Oh, thank you, sir.  Absolutely.  Do you want to say it?  I don't mind standing.  No, no, no.  I'm so good.  I'm standing.  I'm having a great time.  My wife was getting burgers at the Park Meridian, ran into you and said, man, that Henry Winkler  is the nicest guy ever.  But, okay.  Listen, the burger joint.  Now, to me, best burger may be in the United States.  It's crazy, right?  Yeah.  And no one knows about it.  It's hidden in a corner.  Everybody talks about the Shake Shack. 
[02:06:30]  Yep.  You know?  Yeah.  Okay, okay.  But the burger joint at the Park Meridian used to be P.J. Clark's on 53rd and 3rd.  Uh-huh.  We would stop there.  We would land in New York.  And before we went to the hotel, we would stop there for a burger.  Yeah.  But the burger joint is, like, out of control.  It really is great.  We ran into you.  Yeah.  And you could have been nicer.  You could have been nicer to everyone around you.  What are you promoting? 
[02:07:00]  You know, I've just written a book.  Well, tomorrow, one of my favorite television shows that I've ever been on, except for Happy  Days, is Royal Pains.  I don't know that show yet.  Don't worry, no one does.  No, no, no.  I'm watching that.  Oh, thanks.  Do you do that show?  Yeah, that's me.  That's me.  You can't talk about your book.  I'm sorry.  No, you look great, even in the studio.  Oh, thank you.  So I can imagine how adorable you are on TV. 
[02:07:30]  What is Bertha Parker?  I'm talking about your book.  Henry, you see, like I said, he's so nice.  What channel is it?  It's on the travel channel.  The travel channel.  What do you do?  Travel.  I can't wait.  I'm talking about this.  Okay.  I'm going to talk about this, too.  Okay, so the book is called...  I never met an idiot on the river.  Personal is mine.  Oh, my God.  I was on the late show talking to him last night, and he was talking about fly fishing  with Justin, and I just sat there, and I was like, I can't believe it's Henry Winkler. 
[02:08:00]  I went up, and they were all talking, and I went, and I go, my name's Bert.  It's a pleasure to meet you.  And he goes, hey, and I go, I just want to listen.  And I just stood around the corner listening to you talk.  Because that's not creepy at all.  That's perfect.  But I met those two guys.  The Stengels.  Who are the head writers.  They're friends of ours.  Oh, my God.  They're great guys.  I met them on Twitter, because I'm a Twittering fool now.  Yeah.  And I am 50 people away from 61,000 fellow Twitter people.  Boy, you'll get that pretty quick.  You want to see the power of the show? 
[02:08:30]  What's your Twitter?  Huh?  What's your Twitter?  H. Winkler for the number four reel.  Oh, okay.  H. Winkler for the number four reel.  For the number four reel.  Right.  But anyway, I met the Stengel brothers on Twitter.  And I met them first when they were Twittering live from Charlie Sheen's show.  And I swear to you, they were so great at it.  Funny.  It was like I was in the seat with them.  Yeah.  You know?  Yeah.  You got every emotion, every feeling about how horrible he was doing. 
[02:09:00]  And the next thing I did was I tweeted with them.  They were having a Seder.  At Passover.  Yeah.  You know, they're actually Jewish.  And I thought, oh my God, I'm no longer hungry.  The food was so delish.  And then I got to meet them and I did my second comedy bit last night on the David Letterman show.  You were great.  Oh, thanks.  You killed. 
[02:09:30]  Thanks.  I have a copy of your book.  They gave us...  I Never Met an Idiot on the River.  It's like you're holding a big fish.  It looks like when I tell a big fish story.  It's about fly fishing.  Oh, God.  Oh, wow.  You want to see?  This is...  Anyway, it's where they are.  It's about fly fishing, you said?  No.  It's called I Never Met an Idiot on the River.  Okay.  And it started as pictures that I took while fly fishing.  Oh, wow.  On the river.  And then they asked me to write, what did you learn on the river? 
[02:10:00]  I'm going to just...  Oh, here's one.  This is 8.30 at night.  Here.  Beautiful.  That's nice.  I love a good sunset.  A sunset, Ope, right?  I love the sunset.  You like a good sunset.  I sure do.  So that's what it's about.  I tried fly fishing, I guess it was almost two years ago.  I loved it.  I thought...  I went as a joke, because one of our friends likes doing that.  Right.  I'm like, all right.  I'll go for the joke.  Up Roscoe.  Uh-huh.  And I had a ball, man.  It was awesome.  I didn't catch anything, but...  Well, you know what?  It is not that difficult. 
[02:10:30]  You learn it in a half an hour.  Yeah.  You apply it to the rest of your life.  And the fact is that when you're...  What's wrong with you?  Sorry.  No, no, no.  I just thought of how many things in my life I learned in a half an hour that I still do.  I was like, wow, you could say that about a lot of things I do.  Let me ask you a question.  I really want to know now.  What is your show about?  I'm going to watch just for the laugh.  Oh, good.  That's all I do.  It's laugh.  He's beat red.  What's up with you, Bird?  I don't know.  It's just bizarre. 
[02:11:00]  I mean, like, I know that you guys do this every single day, but I don't just hang out  with Henry Winkler every single day.  But what is your show about?  He just wants to know.  I do.  I'm a tour guide for thrills.  If there's something crazy and wild in a city, I go out and do it.  Like, if it's a spongy jump off a bridge, if it's, you know, redneck water skiing.  So what was the most amazing thing you've ever done?  Probably jumping off the stratosphere.  I was just telling Jim.  It was like a life-defining moment.  Like, just overwhelming.  Right.  Getting over anxiety.  That first moment, is it so scary that you don't know what to do? 
[02:11:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Full-blown anxiety attack.  Not breathing.  Like, I went to the bathroom in my pants a little bit.  Sure.  I understand that.  Because I just did, and I have never done it.  Have you ever done it?  I went to the bathroom in my pants just listening.  Did they tell you?  I did tell you.  We're kind of starstruck today.  We talk to a lot of celebrities, but you're, yeah.  I'm starstruck today.  Who's the most famous person you've met?  The most famous?  Like, they kind of overwhelmed you, and you're like, God, I can't do the Fonzie thing at all. 
[02:12:00]  It had to be a U.S. president.  It had to, because Fonzie's one of the most famous characters ever.  I'd like to meet our president.  I would like to meet Barack Obama.  Is it weird to you that you know for a fact he knows who you are?  Like, the men like that know you.  Yeah.  I don't know that he knows.  He does.  Everyone knows.  You're an icon.  You're an iconic character.  Until I look him in the eye, you know?  Who did you meet that actually blew you away?  Oh, you know, I have the hardest time meeting rock stars.  I met Elton John, and I went, hey, John, I want to tell you. 
[02:12:30]  I met Mick Jagger on a plane, and I went, yeah, shut up.  Couldn't speak.  Did he know who you were?  Yes.  He had to.  He said, hi, Henry.  Popcorn.  I met Bruce Springsteen.  If I ever am reincarnated, I'm coming back as Bruce.  And I met him, and I met his wife.  I kissed her hand.  I shook Bruce's hand, and I kissed his hand.  And I thought to myself, what did you just do? 
[02:13:00]  Leave the room now.  No, that's so crazy that it almost sounds like it's an artistic thing to do.  That's so nuts.  I wasn't thinking artistic.  I was thinking embarrassing.  No, it works.  Henry, they're saying you have to go, but we have to ask you one thing.  Yeah.  Why didn't Fonzie ever beat anyone up?  We have talked about this on our show off and on for years.  Everyone was scared of Fonzie, but we're like, he never beat anyone up.  I'll tell you why.  Because power comes from inside. 
[02:13:30]  Cool is from inside.  You don't need to hit somebody.  You don't need to make fun of somebody.  You can just be, and with that, intimidate.  I just did a movie on cage fighting.  You sound like Joe Rogan when you said that.  Okay, he was in the movie.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Okay.  I saw a promo for it this morning.  I would hate to fight a cage.  I'd probably get beat up or something.  You know what?  You would.  Because these men are zen gentlemen, and in that ring, they will eat your heart out. 
[02:14:00]  That is true.  We've had a lot of them on the show, and they're the nicest guys.  Oh, my goodness.  But then you could just see them in the ring, and they flip a switch.  But Boz Routen was one of my actors in the movie.  He was my corner man.  And Boz, he said, I'll tell you something.  He's from Holland.  I'll tell you something.  You know, I'm sitting in a bar, and then five men, they come to me, and I go, okay, I guess so. 
[02:14:30]  And I stand up, and I start to walk at them.  And they go, no, no, no, we want your autograph.  Because he can kick you twice before you ever knew you were kicked once.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, my God.  I can shake your hand.  That's about it.  We've got to push the book, because we've got to get it.  It's called, I've Never Met an Idiot on the River, and a lot of photographs and things that Henry did.  They're really great, actually.  Thank you very much.  They are excellent.  I like good photography. 
[02:15:00]  And a true legend, Henry Winkler.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, well.  Hey, Jimmy, don't ruin my picture.  Oh, you guys bothering poor Henry for pictures.  Henry, thank you so much for stopping in.  Could you sign your book, Mr. Winkler, and then we'll leave you alone.  Thank you very much.  Then we'll leave you alone.  To Jim, on the cover, because I'm going to display it in my thing.  We're still on the air, but it's okay.  Yeah.  I think they know.  Yeah, it's Henry Winkler.  Yeah, come on, listeners.  Trump's everybody.  Hey, listeners.  Thank you very much.  I took a picture of you, and I tweeted it with Jim Norton.  Do you know what?  I was not supposed to be on this show. 
[02:15:30]  I know.  Yeah, this is great.  I listened to you guys.  I'm so happy I was here.  Thank you very much.  I wish I had something to do with the show.  We've come up on the show so many times.  It's a great time.  We get a bad reputation, but all right.  Thank you.  There goes Henry Winkler, everyone.  Take care.  Wow.  That was cool.  Thank you to Bert, because he saw Bert here, and he came in.  Fuck Bert.  Yeah.  That's right.  Bert turned beet red.  Do you think when...  Okay, here's my question.  Yeah.  Hold on.  What happened?  Kenny's got a news alert. 
[02:16:00]  We didn't...  It wasn't because of Bert.  Oh?  He saw the Opie and Anthony logo.  He says, these guys are very funny.  How does...  And Roland says, why don't you go in and say hello?  How does the Fonz know our show?  Oh, my...  See, that freaks me out a little bit.  Oh, my God, am I...  That's crazy.  Not that it's about me, but look at the picture of Henry, and oh, my God, it's fucking Darth  Vader without the helmet.  I should never...  Jimmy!  I'm just fucking ugly. 
[02:16:30]  This could be one of the worst pictures of you I've ever seen.  I swear.  I can't see it.  That's a...  That's a...  That's a make-a-wish picture.  You know what's the worst thing is there's a glare on your face.  No, the worst thing is my nine necks.  It looks like your chin has balls.  That is...  Because you always go, ugh, I took a horrible picture, and I look and usually go like, no,  that's not bad.  You look good.  That is one of the worst pictures I've ever seen of you. 
[02:17:00]  Because he was taking a photo with Chip.  I didn't know he was going to come in.  And Chip, oh, wow, I've been recording this whole thing on my phone.  I didn't mean to.  Oh, wait, look at that.  Oh, God, that is a horrid picture of you.  Let me just play the beginning for you.  I did not know that this was going to, uh, hold on, happen...  Oh, you have some audio.  From the, wait, very beginning.  Oh, okay.  What, of meeting him?  Oh, no.  Yeah, before.  Oh, my God.  Oh, no.  Hold on.  Let me see if I got it.  That's so cool.  He's like...  He just kind of came in.  That was great, right?  That was the show. 
[02:17:30]  Do you think, do you think, here's my question, right?  So when Fonz was the biggest thing in the world.  Yeah.  And he, but he still was Henry Winkler.  Yeah.  He is who he is.  It was always weird to see him as Henry Winkler, because you want to know him as Fonz, that  he walks through life as the Fonz.  Yeah.  Like, how weird do you think that was when people were like, oh, shit, it's the Fonz.  And he's like, hey, hey.  And he's like, hi, I'm Henry.  Yeah.  The actor.  I bet the studio was like, can you not go out much?  Yeah.  Or if you do, you wear the jacket, kind of go eh a lot, put your thumbs up, squee. 
[02:18:00]  Oh, this is, wait, this is the show.  Hold on.  Oh.  Jimmy's taping things for the show.  No, no, this is just my photo with him.  Hold on.  He's doing show prep.  Hold on.  There was a bit of a chip bomb.  Uh-oh.  Let me get another picture.  Okay.  Hi.  Can I ask you to sign a photo of us together?  That's meek, Jimmy.  Okay, this is outside the studio before you come on. 
[02:18:30]  It's the bottom.  Oh, don't humiliate me.  He said tie.  Okay.  Let me take the picture.  Oh, come on.  Can I take a regular photo of you?  All right.  I sound like I'm seducing.  I'm sensual.  It does sound like I'm listening to you guys fuck.  Oh, no.  Oh, no. 
[02:19:00]  You didn't.  What did you do?  You chipped him.  Because he mentioned his tie.  Yes.  You chipped Henry Winkler.  Wait.  Can I take a regular photo of you?  Yeah.  All right.  I don't wear ties.  I can never tie them like shoes or something.  Oh, no.  It's just silence.  How embarrassing.  Do you know how unfunny he must think I am? 
[02:19:30]  I could never fight a cage.  I could never fight a cage or something.  You turned beet red during the Henry Winkler's season.  Yeah.  It's so bizarre.  It is weird.  I'm a starstruck.  I mean, that's a biggie right there.  Oh, yeah.  I grew up with Happy Days.  What the fuck?  He is an American icon.  A world icon.  Sure.  He can't go anywhere without people knowing him.  It's so true.  I never understood it.  But when you said everyone knows who he is.  The president does know who he is.  I said that, too.  No, you didn't say anything.  Guy who wants credit. 
[02:20:00]  No, no.  I said that.  More importantly, we learned that Henry Winkler knows who we are today.  I'm amazed by that.  So let's take that home with us today.  I'm amazed by that.  And you know what?  The strength comes from the inside.  That's right.  I can't imagine.  You answered the question, though.  That was a great question.  Although, you know.  A great answer to it.  Fonzie should have punched somebody in the face.  Yeah, he should have.  Early on.  First season, when it was done on film.  Or stabbed somebody.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's like prison.  First day in.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You gotta just beat the crap out of it.  Like Ralph Mouth, he just bloodies his fucking face.  Bam, bam. 
[02:20:30]  Curbs him.  Pounded his face into the floor.  Fuck you, Mouth.  And then you realize why everyone's afraid of him for the next 10 years that the show's  on.  Yeah, nice man.  Just a nice man.  He is.  Funny, though, man.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Really, just a nice, quiet man.  We should take a break and get ready for Linda Hogan.  Yes.  She's gonna be here at any moment.  Another nice man.  And Bird, you can stick around.  Yeah, I'm not having a flight at 145.  Yeah, hang out, man.  Just move over to that mic over there.  Yeah, no, no, no.  Of course.  Linda's in the middle.  Birth to Conquer Wednesdays at 10 p.m. on the Travel Channel.  We'll talk about the show a little more after she leaves. 
[02:21:00]  We don't need to.  After she runs out of here.  After she flees this studio.  She's gonna ask hard questions.  She'll be nice.  She'll be awesome.  By the way, Opie.  Yes.  Meeting in an hour and ten minutes.  Yay!  I'm ready for Linda Hogan now.  Hey, this is John Belvey.  Hey, this is Larry the Cable Dad.  Hey, folks, this is Mark Maron.  Hey, this is comedian Nick DiPaoli.  What's up?  This is Joe Rogan.  You are listening to the Opie and Anthony Show, my favorite show in the history of the  fucking universe. 
[02:21:30]  All right, we got Bert Kreischer in studio from Bert the Conqueror.  He loved meeting the Fonz.  Henry Winkler was cool.  He was so cool.  He's gonna have to come back and do a longer segment with us.  He was worried about doing our show because we're shock jocks.  Well, I guess he knows.  We put on a different hat for Mr. Winkler.  Oh, I wrote a pilot.  I tried to sell it with me and Jay Moore for Comedy Central based off of you guys.  Really?  Oh, shit.  Yeah.  That was a long time ago.  It was called the shock jocks. 
[02:22:00]  It was about you guys, right?  In my head, I just hit you guys.  But you guys have been kicked off the air again.  And you're like, well, there's no redemption.  We're never going back.  So you guys started a radio station in Mexico, like right on the border of San Antonio.  So like your shit played into it.  It leaked into the state.  Played into it, right.  But you could do, and it was lawless fucking Mexico.  So you're like, all right, we got, we're going to kill puppies this morning.  Yeah.  And you're like, if you get a question wrong, we kill a puppy.  That's great.  You're like a fucking thing, a litter of like runaway dogs.  And you're like, first question, who's the secretary of state in 1812? 
[02:22:30]  And the girl's like, I have no idea.  That is great.  Yeah.  And I took it.  And then they were like, we like the pitch.  What would they look like?  And I was like, fuck.  And so I literally tried to draw.  I'm a worst artist.  But I drew a picture.  And Jay was like, I'll do it.  He was like, write a one page.  Let's sell it.  And I pitched it to Comedy Central.  And they're like, you've got to be like a real animation guy to do that.  Oh, it was going to be an animation?  Well, yeah.  Well, I was going to do it.  I could do it.  You can't really kill puppies live.  Yeah, that's kind of rough.  I mean, it would be hard.  But if you did an animation, you could totally kill puppies. 
[02:23:00]  You could do whatever the fuck you want.  Donkey show.  You name it.  South Park has proven that.  Donkey show.  Like, imagine the shit you guys could do if you had no laws.  Yeah.  How great would that be?  Like, yeah, just being, it would be like any W.  We had the wrong place.  Firing bottle rockets out of their pussies.  Language.  I just checked my Twitter.  And you were on Joe Rogan's podcast.  And there was something about a dream, an Opie and Anthony dream or something.  I told this.  And I did not hear this yet on the Rogan podcast.  He goes, so, okay, this is full disclosure. 
[02:23:30]  So, like, probably five years ago, like, I've been listening to shows since you guys got to XM.  And so five years ago, I had a show on Spike that was about video games.  And I was like, Anthony's a huge video game guy.  I love him, yeah.  And I was like, oh, I told the publicist, we did a tour.  And she goes, I go, get me on Opie and Anthony, because Anthony loves video games.  And I guarantee we could talk forever.  Oh, no, we said no.  And they're like, no.  Why?  And I said, no, no, no, no.  No, I know Jim.  And she goes, then call Jim.  I go, I'm not calling Jim.  You could have called me. 
[02:24:00]  I know, but that's not who I am.  I'm not that guy.  And so I go, I want it to really happen or not to happen.  I'm not going to force myself down someone's throat.  So she goes, they said no.  And I said, call back.  I forget who was working here.  I think it was Ben.  Wow, I told you.  And I go, tell Ben that I'm a listener.  I'm a fan of the show.  I'm friends with Jay Moore.  And that it's about video games.  It'll be right up Anthony's alley.  And they were like, Ben said fucking no.  Oh, man.  And I was like, all right.  So in my head, I'm like, not a big deal.  So then I get another TV show. 
[02:24:30]  Oh, no, I do my hour special.  And they do the whole fucking radio tour.  And I go, the only show I really want to do is Opie and Anthony.  And the lady does the thing.  And she goes, yeah, it's not going to happen.  Why the fuck?  Why?  So wait, hold on.  So it gets fucking, it gets really aggressive, right?  Oh, no.  So I'm like, I go, are you serious?  And she goes, yeah.  If you know someone, you can call in.  So I run into Voss at like the improv.  And he's like, how come I'm not doing Opie and Anthony?  And I was like, I tried.  And he goes, just fucking call him.  I talked to Bobby Kelly.  He goes, just fucking call him.  And I go, I'm not.  I want it to go through the right channel.  I don't want to just fucking.  And so then I get Bird the Conqueror, first season. 
[02:25:00]  I'm like, I go, hey, we'll do the tour.  All I want to do is Opie and Anthony.  I'm on fucking TV with Jill Nicolini.  And I'm not doing fucking Opie and Anthony, right?  And they said, no.  And I go, are you serious?  And they're like, yeah, I think it's Opie.  He doesn't like you.  Why is it always me?  In my head, I go, I fucking met Opie with Jay Moore.  And Opie said, you had been canceled then.  And you're like, yeah, you're really funny.  If we had a show, we'd totally put you on.  If we only had a show, yeah.  People love to put all that shit on me. 
[02:25:30]  I didn't even know you.  I know.  And that was the reason we said no, probably.  And so I go, fuck.  So the second season of Birth of Conqueror airs.  And I go, I know it's going to be a no, but I really want to do Opie and Anthony.  And they're like, and my publicist, Caitlin, goes, I've tried again.  It's not going to happen.  And so I started having dreams that I'd get in the studio and you would fucking make fun  of me because I was like, Opie hates me.  And so in my dreams, in my dreams, that's my flow.  You and management have the same dreams. 
[02:26:00]  Oh, I hate management.  Yeah.  So I'd have dreams.  And so Rogan, I was doing Rogan's podcast and he was like, he was like, I said something.  I had a fucked up dream last night.  Oh, I told my dad.  I was like, I called my dad and I was like, I had a fucked up dream.  My dad's like, you still dream?  I was like, what do you dream about ponies and shit?  And I was like, sometimes.  And so I told Rogan, I said, I had a fucking dream where I was doing radio with Norton,  with Opie and Anthony.  Norton wasn't in studio.  And I came in and Opie's, and you fucking annihilated me because it's my dream. 
[02:26:30]  So you are me and you're saying all this shit about me that I know is true that hurts.  And I'm fucking, and so I'm mounting a fight against myself, but it's you and we're fighting  And you're like, so this Rolling Stone thing, you're just still going to ride that?  Like, is that the only thing you've ever fucking done?  I'm like, oh, motherfucker.  And you're like, he knows me.  And so I told Rogan and Rogan thought it was fucking hilarious.  He was like, you've got fights that you have dreams that you fight with Opie.  I said, yeah, all the time.  He's like, you got to fucking tell him.  And then on this show, I go, I've never done Opie in anything.  I told Rogan that.  And he was like, oh, you could get on that show. 
[02:27:00]  Okay.  So three days ago, I get, you know, the offer to do Letterman and I'm sitting in my man cave and  then I get a text, do you want to do the after show with Sam and Roland?  The after show?  Who sent that shit up?  Yeah, who the fuck is booking people for the after show?  So I called Jay Moore and he goes, it's a fucking insult.  He goes, tell him you don't do fucking Opie and Anthony or you didn't do nothing.  And I was like, I'm not going to fucking say a word.  I'm not saying a thing.  I go, I can't do it because my flight's leaving at 110 or at one.  So I go, I can't do the late show.  I probably would have because I'm, I'm a fan of all parts of the show. 
[02:27:30]  So like even seeing Sam, I saw him in the, in the hallway and I was like,  I was like, primetime Sam Roberts.  But so, but.  Well, now it all makes sense because Justin writes me, I didn't know all this history  and he's like, you really need to have Bert on the show.  I'm like, yeah, we're going to have Bert on the show.  Yeah.  So obviously you discussed all this with him.  I told it to him.  Like how do I get on that fucking show?  No, no, I said, I called Cowhead and I called Jay and the only two people I spoke to about  it.  And I think Cal might've told Justin.  Dude, after all this, you should have walked in the door and just gone. 
[02:28:00]  Yeah, I'm on.  Fuck you.  I go, this is going to be my thing.  I've been a long time ago.  You guys go fuck yourself.  Yeah, go fuck yourselves.  Assholes and then leave.  Opie, I have the best advice on his show.  No, you didn't.  He has the best advice with me.  I could argue like, oh man, I've had so many fucking, where I wake up from a dream where  Opie like threw dominoes at me or something.  Oh, and in the dream, Jim wasn't there.  And I was like, in my head, I'm like, if Jim had just been there, he would be like, Bert's  a good guy.  I'll be lighting up. 
[02:28:30]  Be cool.  Be cool.  I like Bert for many years.  There's a guy I met a few months ago named Bert Kreischer.  He's the host of Bert the Conqueror.  Really funny guy.  I liked him so much.  I had him booked on our show on Monday.  I think you guys would really like him.  And he's a big O&A fan.  And I thought this was weird when he wrote me.  Yeah.  Justin's like a fucking saint.  And then he writes casually, just thought I'd mention him.  Like this was discussed at nausea.  I'm reading shit.  Thought Bert was cool until he started gushing over dumb Sam.  That will ruin it. 
[02:29:00]  You blew it.  Ah, Jesus.  I wonder what that was about.  That's you, Sam.  I think we just didn't know you, man.  No, no.  That is a weird thing.  I've seen it happen at radio stations.  And it just, it's like, you know, it goes to one guy and they're like, do you want to  have Bert Kreischer on?  Not a name you'd recognize.  And unless you're familiar with me or know that I started comedy in New York.  Like, I don't know how it would happen.  So I totally got it.  But we've had on Steve the Whistler.  You know?  Yeah, but sometimes people that make toothpick fucking art. 
[02:29:30]  Sometimes it's just that we're overbooked with other people.  So it's like, we can't have any more guests.  The last time you didn't have me in, you had literally a fucking gala of stars in here.  Like, it was, I was like, I can't get me pissed at that.  It was like, it was like a Friday.  And I think, I want to say Donald Trump or someone was in here.  Like, it was just fucking all celebrities.  Probably one of those.  Yeah, you know what?  It's our loss.  No, no, no.  I'm glad it's finally happened.  I mean, this would be the only time you're on.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Perfect time.  It was a great appearance. 
[02:30:00]  Perfect time.  You can take that with you.  They said to me at Letterman, they're like, he did really great.  You know, let us know when you're back in New York.  I'm like, next week, I'm here, I'm here.  Please, please.  Wow, they said that to us and we've never been back.  Really?  I swear to you, Bert.  Wait, did they tell you you killed it?  I think it's because of the Leno thing.  We might have fucked it up by going on Leno a little too soon.  No, you didn't.  Oh, boy.  No, you didn't.  Oh, wait.  Oh, I do know the real story.  What?  You didn't fuck it up by going on Leno.  Going on Leno was a great move.  Yeah.  Fuck it.  I do know the real story.  What's the real story?  Someone got mad.  Howard called Letterman's people, this is the God's honest truth, and it was finally 
[02:30:30]  told to me.  Yes, I do know.  And we're about talking honestly on the show.  And I forgot until Jimmy just said that.  That is the absolute truth.  Is it Howard put the kibosh on it?  Yes.  It's like, why do you have those guys on?  Yes.  Really?  He goes, everything I've done for you, you know, we've been pals for all these years,  blah, blah, blah.  And he called in a favor.  Now, that was a few years ago.  That's the absolute truth.  And I do know that, and Jimmy knows that, and I can't say who told us, and it's no one 
[02:31:00]  that we've discussed today, by the way.  That was actually...  I do know that.  When we were on camera.  Because we were like, what the fuck?  Yeah, that was when you guys did the switchover.  Which I'm so, by the way, I'm going to say this, I'm so glad you guys aren't doing  trust me.  You and me both.  I know.  I hated that fucking place.  I literally would just wait until you did the walkover.  Yeah.  Because there's something so real about this.  This is so special.  Like, when you're listening as a listener, because you can't do this on regular radio.  No.  First of all, you can't talk ad nauseum about nothing. 
[02:31:30]  Right.  Yeah, you need some kind of fucking structure.  You just want a little bigger audience, and then it would be perfect.  It still feels a little thin at times.  Because you know why?  Because you don't get around the country.  You see how many people listen.  Like, when you're in Austin, and I sold out a bunch of shows in Austin, and it's literally  all because of the show.  I had never been there.  Or when you go to fucking Seattle, and you start seeing, like, oh, wow, people really  do hear it in other places.  Yeah, but we killed Don Letterman.  Way to be dramatic and ruin the fun, Jim.  We killed Don Letterman, and one of the big, big producers came upstairs, immediately 
[02:32:00]  said, you guys killed, we want to get you back sooner than later.  And Justin actually turned to me and I remember, I remember, like, it was yesterday.  Yeah, yeah.  She never comes up here, holy shit.  And they're like, all right, man, we might have an in.  This is going to be cool.  Never happened again.  Oh, well.  And then years later, I do know the exact story.  So now, if you knew it was your only time on Letterman, would you have done things differently?  Like, pulled a Crispin Glover and tried to kick him?  Yeah, right.  No, he's never been back.  No.  Crispin Glover's fucking out of his mind.  He is fucking insane. 
[02:32:30]  But that's great, though, when you get a loose cannon like that.  But there was a phone call that was made, and that is the absolute truth, and I would  love to hear him deny that.  I don't think you will.  I don't think you'll hear that.  Nah.  You know what else is good about Soundlight Radio?  If I got to piss?  Go.  I can just get up and piss.  Go!  Because there's enough people.  Linda Hogan's late, by the way.  Linda Hogan ain't coming after what?  9.30?  That's fine.  I got a bunch of questions.  What happened?  Maybe she's with the fucking warrior?  How strong is Hulk?  Is she with the warrior?  No, the blue meanie. 
[02:33:00]  She's having sex with the wrestlers.  She's giving the blue meanie head right now.  That's right.  Having sex with wrestlers.  That's what she's doing.  I get obsessed with wrestling, and I'll go, like, I'll get, like, I'll, no, no, let's  not talk wrestling.  Okay.  Because Sam, Sam is just, loves it.  You could do that on the after show.  I won't say a thing.  You could do a whole wrestling show with Sam.  He wouldn't mind.  But I just get obsessed with dead wrestlers.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Like, I'll fucking research all this.  You know our bit, right?  No.  We're trying to go 100 days without a wrestler diet.  We've been doing this for years.  How many years have we been doing it, Sam? 
[02:33:30]  A couple years now?  Two years, yeah.  Maybe two and a half years.  And there's been a couple questionable that were low-rung guys, but in general, we haven't  gone 100 days in two years.  Yeah, definitely haven't.  Without one dead wrestler.  That's crazy.  Yeah.  You think it's the pills or the steroids?  It's the lifestyle, yeah.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  It's all that.  Pills will creep up on you.  It's pills.  It's being on the road.  You know, that schedule.  73 days was the most.  73 days we make.  See, he has a whole... 
[02:34:00]  Yeah.  He keeps track and everything.  Are you shitting me?  Yeah, no, man.  It's my job.  It's real.  Man, macho, man.  Holy shit.  That was a big one.  What?  Did he have a heart attack in a car?  While he was driving.  Oh, that sucks.  I had a teacher in college.  Awesome dude.  Like, showed up.  First, like, Monday is a writing class.  He showed up and he's like,  if you want to be a fucking writer,  you better not be available on Mondays.  Monday classes are canceled.  Friday classes are canceled.  All we have to do is just...  Everyone just write and we'll read them.  That was it.  That's awesome.  And then I was like, 
[02:34:30]  this fucking rocks.  And then halfway...  Yeah, why make it so hard?  And he was like,  it was awesome, man.  And he'd pick...  Like, there was this hot chick  who wrote a story  about getting fucked in a meat locker at work.  And he was like...  And he had read her...  And he was like,  read yours out loud.  And I remember just being like...  He had long hair,  looked like Jim Morrison.  And then halfway through the semester,  he was riding his motorcycle  fucking high on coke  and had a heart attack and died.  Jesus.  And then we had a new fucking teacher.  He was like,  classes on Mondays are back.  Of course.  Yeah, but...  Yeah, but fucking...  A lot of good that writing career did me. 
[02:35:00]  Hey, everybody wants me  to ask you about the animal.  What's that?  Fighting the bear?  I don't know.  What animal?  The animal story I heard  on Rogan's podcast.  Yes, he's amazing.  Animal story from Russia.  That's the one...  I told the machine story.  Yeah, the machine,  maybe they're getting a mix-up.  No, I fought a bear  for Hurt Burt.  And maybe that's what they're talking about.  Was it a trained bear?  Yeah, it was a stage bear.  It was like a movie bear.  But still, what the fuck, right?  Still a bear, right?  Yeah, still a fucking bear.  And I'm not certain about this,  but I'm almost certain. 
[02:35:30]  It's the bear that went on  to fight Will Ferrell  in Semi-Pro.  Okay.  And that bear  killed his fucking trainer.  Yes, it did.  So we went out there  and it was Hurt Burt,  so I'd take dangerous jobs for a day.  No one ever saw the show  because it got canceled.  Why wouldn't they see that show?  It sounds like a great concept.  Kevin Reilly bought it  and then left and went to NBC,  and so it just got...  What happened?  I'm sorry, I'm sorry.  No, it's fine.  No, you lifted your phone up.  I was just going to say,  oh, she's here,  but I was just going to bring her in.  Linda Hogan's here?  Yeah, bring her in.  Keep going.  No, no, no.  I'll fuck the story. 
[02:36:00]  Move over, Burt.  Oh, yeah.  You go there.  You move the fuck over.  You're sweaty, though.  God damn, is she hot.  Get the fuck out of here.  I'll just blow on him.  Oh, no.  Where's my book?  Can you get it out of the garbage?  Yeah, just wipe him.  That's where I have a reference.  Thanks.  Hi, Linda.  Hey, hi, guys.  How are you?  Here's your soda.  Wow.  Sorry.  You want to sit there?  Please.  Hi, how are you?  Jim, nice to meet you. 
[02:36:30]  Hi, I'm Burt.  Nice to meet you.  Hey, you too.  That's Opie,  and that's young Sam.  Damn, you're hot.  That's it.  Holy shit.  You look lovely.  And we didn't get your book enough.  We got it literally yesterday,  so we've only perused it.  We haven't had a chance to read the whole thing.  Yeah, they should have gave it to us a little earlier,  but that's okay.  How are you?  I'm good.  Thank you.  I grew up in Tampa.  Oh, you did?  So don't tell me you're a Hulk fan.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  No, no, no, no.  I know, but I obviously, like, you know, the whole area. 
[02:37:00]  We have a house in Clearwater right by that greenhouse you guys are still on.  Oh, yeah.  On El Dorado?  The beach house right there.  Oh, I shouldn't tell everyone.  I think Terry lives on that street.  Actually, he lives two or three houses down from our old house.  Oh, yeah?  In a much smaller house, right?  So now, how candid can I be?  Because I'm not a part of the show.  I'm just a stand-up comedian.  Yeah, that's Bert.  I have tons of questions.  Okay.  Is it cool? 
[02:37:30]  Yeah, she's writing a tell-all book.  Oh, really?  Okay.  Yes, Linda Hogan's telling everything.  Okay.  Wait, just so we...  We're not Team Hulk.  We're not Team Linda.  We're going to decide after today, though.  I'm Team Linda.  We're Team Linda for today.  She's very attractive, and she smells great.  I'll tell you who we are.  Brooke, though, we've had in a few times.  She's great.  Oh, yeah.  Brooke is amazing.  Yeah, I'm Team Brooke, too.  And I think she beat Bob Kelly in an arm wrestling contest.  She's strong.  Yeah, he's kind of one of our transgender friends.  He's sucked a few. 
[02:38:00]  But anyway.  You want to start, Bert?  Yes, I do.  Yes?  What?  Were you asking?  Oh, yes.  We're live.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh.  Yeah, we're going on over two countries.  Okay.  All U.S., all Canada.  Is that bad?  Yeah.  No, it's better live.  You can curse, too.  Oh, yeah.  No, I'm good.  Okay.  Oh.  We started the interview already.  Sure.  Yeah, you put them on if you want, sure.  But you don't have to.  You're going to mess up your hair, though.  Yeah, yeah.  And your hair looks good.  I'm all good.  All right, Bert, go ahead.  Okay, this is my first question.  I heard that Hulk cheated on you with Elizabeth. 
[02:38:30]  You know, I don't know that.  Randy Macho Man Savage swears by it.  Or not anymore.  No, he doesn't swear on anything anymore.  Very sad story.  No, you know, I don't know about that.  I really am not privy to that.  Well, you talk about infidelity in the book, right?  Like, you do talk about him.  When was the first time that you believe, at least, that he was unfaithful?  How long into your being together?  In my opinion?  Yeah.  Back when Nick was born.  I mean, back in 90, you know?  I mean, it was just my opinion. 
[02:39:00]  I had a very strong sense that he was banging one of the girls at the gym.  What made you think that?  Well, you know, we started out working at this one gym.  We worked out together.  I was trying to get my bod back in shape after Nick was born.  And then, you know, we met Corey at this gym.  And then pretty soon, they started training at another gym near her house.  And the workouts went from two hours to three hours to, like, four hours.  And I'm thinking, like, what's going on, you know?  And I ended up having to hire an investigator. 
[02:39:30]  I just had such strong suspicions.  And you hired the investigator.  Didn't you get – because there was one part of the book I read where you hire an investigator and there's photos or there's –  is she the one that came to you and said that she was – you might be knocked up and then all the tapes –  No, that was a different situation.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, no, the investigator followed him all around.  He posed as a workout guy in the gym, you know?  And it's just – you know, you can't – unless you can go in the house with him, you know, there's no proof.  So I guess it's, you know, like I say in the book, innocent until proven guilty. 
[02:40:00]  But there was one –  I knew in my heart of hearts.  But, yeah, you knew.  You could always tell.  Like, you could just smell it on somebody, you know what I mean?  They come home and they're just disheveled.  The hair is matted a little bit.  Right.  That was one of the problems that we started experiencing, you know?  I mean, when – you know, I wrote the book mainly, ultimately, to tell other women, you know, that these signs exist.  You know, you know when you know.  Your heart knows.  And instead of sitting there and taking it for so long or thinking that you have no options or there's no way out, you know, there really is. 
[02:40:30]  You don't have to sit there and put up with that kind of treatment.  You know, your life counts for something, too.  Move on.  Get happy.  Did you – what was the one – you said there was one woman who you thought was a little unbalanced who came to you and said that he had gotten her pregnant.  And then you hired an investigator and all of a sudden the investigator disappeared.  What happened?  Because I didn't –  Well, what happened with that was I was – I had a restaurant and these postcards started coming anonymously at first.  And then they – she started leaving her name and they were coming from Germany or Austria or somewhere. 
[02:41:00]  And she would write really graphic things on these postcards.  And everybody that, you know –  Like sexually graphic things?  Oh, yeah.  I mean, I don't want to say, you know, any foul words.  Please do.  You can say foul words.  Could you please say it and slowly?  You know, I love sucking his juicy blah, you know.  Oh, about him.  Yeah.  Okay.  Does he have a juicy – so you know who?  I don't like you.  I just don't want you in my way.  You're in my way of me and Hulk's relationship.  Okay, okay. 
[02:41:30]  I mean, it was just this horrible stuff.  Wow.  And they've gone for over a year.  And I confronted him about that.  And I said, you know, what's going on?  You know, what am I supposed to believe?  Because, you know, this is coming off the heels of the affair that I actually knew about.  Oh, this is after the gym thing?  Okay.  So I was just to the point where – it was after the Minnesota thing.  So, I mean, I just didn't know what to believe anymore, you know.  It's like I want to believe him.  I think everybody deserves a second chance.  But this was after his second chance, you know.  And I thought, well, he's like, oh, it's just a deranged fan.  It's, you know. 
[02:42:00]  Right.  You want to believe that.  But then again, everything that she was saying was kind of true.  Kind of true.  Yeah.  And she sent me an audio cassette and said that she wanted to cut my face and burn my house,  that she didn't like me, and that she was nine months pregnant with his child.  And, you know, that was pretty much the clincher.  I was like, all right.  And, you know, if you know about this and you agree that this is not cool and that you're innocent  and that this isn't happening, then you will come to the investigator with me,  and we are going to look into this and have this stopped.  You know, I want this put to a stop. 
[02:42:30]  And he wouldn't go to the investigator with me.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Hmm.  I'm not going to entertain that, brother.  All the postcards and all the tape, everything disappeared from the –  Oh, really?  You gave it to the investigator?  Yes, I did.  All the stuff.  And then you said you went to the investigator one time and it was just gone.  His office had moved?  He had moved, and then when I did try to call him, he said he gave me the new address.  But I said, well, I'm coming to pick up all my things.  He goes, well, that's going to be kind of hard to do because I don't have them.  They got lost and moving.  And I'm like, wait a minute.  Lost and moving. 
[02:43:00]  Investigators don't lose evidence.  So what do you think happened?  You know, I'm not going to say.  I don't know.  My opinion is –  Your opinion, of course.  He paid off the guy.  Is your opinion that –  He must have gotten paid off.  By somebody.  Yeah.  I'm not going to mention names, but I mean, yeah.  You think that he might have – okay.  Wow, that's pretty smart.  So this is – I had always been under the impression that the reality show broke you  guys up, that that's what happens on reality shows is it puts a spotlight on everyone.  Everyone goes kind of fucking – kind of implodes a little bit.  But the reality show just kind of gave you the courage to walk away. 
[02:43:30]  You know, the reality show wasn't the part that was the problem.  I mean, we had fun doing that show.  And in fact, you know, at the time that our marriage was just really on the rocks, you know,  we would get up in the morning and his sink was here.  My sink was here.  And we'd get ready.  And he wouldn't look at me.  He wouldn't talk to me.  He couldn't look me in the eye anymore, you know.  You had separate sinks?  Well, you know, in the same bathroom.  Couldn't sink up or something.  Yeah.  It was hard because I would wake up every day and just want to try to have a conversation  and whatever.  But I think he was just so overwhelmed with secrets and guilt and everything else that, 
[02:44:00]  you know, was going on behind the scenes.  Oh, that he couldn't even look at me.  Right, right, right.  He really couldn't look at me.  He didn't want to try to have a conversation.  You know, I might screw up your stories.  Yeah, yeah.  Right.  You never want to say something casually in conversation that wrecks a lie you've told  yesterday.  Yeah.  And so, you know, we really didn't have any kind of this communication or not much of  a relationship.  And so, but when we would go down and start shooting, you know, there would be a funny  scenario that would go on and we'd all start laughing and you'd sort of forget it.  You know, you'd be in the moment, living in the moment. 
[02:44:30]  So it actually kind of brought us together.  And I would think that, you know, maybe we could like overcome that.  And, you know, it was a good day.  How are you doing today?  And he'd go right back to his old mode.  There was a real emotional part in that show when Hulk was on the water.  On the boat.  And he drove by the old house.  Looking at his house.  Wow.  When he wasn't allowed to go in the house.  And the dogs are barking.  The dogs are barking.  I can't even go there, brother.  And he got all emotional.  Brooke's getting all emotional.  Like, what the fuck? 
[02:45:00]  Yeah, you know, that's a good sign of somebody that does a lot of lying, you know.  Oh, really?  So that's why I bring it up, because it was a big part of the show after you guys broke up.  Well, you know what?  He's got to live with the decisions that he made.  Those are the choices he made.  And this is the repercussions.  This is just one of them.  So he's a bullshitter, you think?  Yeah.  Wow.  By the way, just to plug this, too, as we're going along here, Linda will be signing tonight, Tuesday, 7 o'clock.  Bookends in New Jersey. 
[02:45:30]  A lot of you have seen me there.  It's a great place for signing, because there's a lot of room to wait, so you're not going to get wet if it rains.  It's on 211 East Ridgewood Avenue, so you can go there and get your book signed.  And I love the pictures in your book.  Yeah.  You seem like you picked a few that made Hulk kind of look like an ass.  Not that you did that on purpose.  With the big hats, like from Apocalypse Now.  Why does he always wear hats and headbands?  Because he's lost all of his hair.  Because he's got shitty hair.  It's just genetic, you know?  Some people think that steroids make your hair fall out.  I don't really know. 
[02:46:00]  I mean, but he's been, he lost his hair back when he was like 28.  It was thinning when he was really young.  Yeah, he was young.  You could definitely see.  So he does the bandana thing.  My dad actually showed him how to tie the bandana on, you know?  We were on a Harley, and he's like, here, man, put this on, you know?  So that's how that started.  Did you get sick of the bandana, or were you okay with it?  You know what?  Honestly, we're just us.  I mean, yeah.  You know, I mean, the bandana's cool.  But, you know, at the time, you know, I loved him for what he was.  I didn't care if he was bald or he had green hair or purple hair, you know?  But it was always, he was always kind of in character, you know?  Right.  And I got, I was like, can you ever just be you? 
[02:46:30]  Right.  You know, I just, like, does it always have to be the...  Over-the-top guy?  I call him for dinner.  I'm like, wait a minute, where are you?  You know, maybe I should play his music, and then he'll come down.  She'll play his music, and he'll come down.  Did you think that...  It's entrance music.  In all honesty, did you think that Hulkster in Heaven was a good song?  You know, that song was written for a...  Yes.  A sick kid.  Absolutely.  A sad situation.  And, you know...  But the song itself, let's, you know, just us. 
[02:47:00]  Well, he's not...  Was he hoping it was going to be a huge hit?  Look, he's a wrestler.  He's not a singer, okay?  Would you hear it, though?  Really?  Forget it.  The part that's nice is what it was meant to be symbolically and who it was for.  But would you kind of hear it and go like, eh, turn that off?  Yeah, it's sad, you know?  And I don't know.  Jimmy Hart did a lot of the writing on that album, and it was kind of a quick thing.  You know, back when Vince was trying to get all the wrestlers to be, you know, that crossover  into television and music and stuff like that.  So, you know, it was just an amateur album.  But, you know...  Will you listen to it when it's on or no?  Hey, I have a song on that album. 
[02:47:30]  What's the name of your song?  I never heard it.  He's the Man.  He's the Man?  Is it about Hulk?  Yeah.  That's nice.  Back in the day.  Oh, boy.  Do we have a copy of that?  Not that you'd want to hear it, but, I mean, if we did, we could play it as you, you know.  Yeah.  How big's his dick?  Wow.  Okay.  You don't ask like that.  We don't know, Bert.  You probably say on a scale from...  Let's just say this.  Does the steroids affect that area?  Let's just...  That's how you ask that, Bert.  No, you have to ask nicely.  You have to say, look.  It's about...  I'm just curious.  Bert just blasts that one out.  There's a way to ask that. 
[02:48:00]  You say, look, he's a big man.  You ask a lady nicely.  He's a very large man.  We all wanted to know, does he have a large penis?  It's not creepy if you ask quietly.  Okay.  Really?  That makes it so creepy.  I know.  I'm kidding.  He nicknamed it the peanut.  The peanut?  No.  Shut up.  No, he nicknamed it?  Oh, wow.  See, that or she was banging Jimmy Carter.  That's...  I don't want to go like...  Yeah.  I'm not being...  I'm not trying to be...  No, no, no, no.  You guys can make whatever you want to.  He nicknamed it the peanut? 
[02:48:30]  Yeah.  Did you feel that that was a...  Did you...  Is it...  Now, was it done ironically?  Like, when you see a six foot five guy,  hey, tiny!  Because he's obviously so big.  Is that why he did that or no?  Mm, could be.  Oh, I don't think so.  So you're saying the peanut might have been the right name for it?  It could have been.  Yeah.  You didn't...  Like when he said, hey, it's the peanut,  you didn't argue and go, no, it's not?  I never had an argument about that.  Is Charlie's bigger?  Oh, yeah.  Wow. 
[02:49:00]  Hey, I gotta ask you something.  Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Tell me if this is me or not.  Hold on, let that sit there for a second.  We're all uncomfortable.  I'm glad you were honest, but I think it hurts all of us on some...  But, I mean, Jimmy, you should tell her what, you know,  turns you on when you're your girl.  Honestly, when I'm having sex with a girl...  That's why I asked this.  I like when a woman tells me that she has slept with guys who have...  Like, I'm fine in that area, whatever.  But I like when she talks about guys who are bigger.  Like, there's a certain humiliation you get as a guy. 
[02:49:30]  Like, whatever you're...  I can imagine.  It's Jimmy's turn-on, though.  I like to be a little bit humiliated.  That's the oddest thing ever.  But it's weird because Jimmy has a big dick, so it's not...  No, it's fine.  It's not big.  It's fine.  I saw it when we did Last Comic Standing 2.  I remember taking a place next to you.  What are you doing looking at this?  I just took a look at it, and I sat...  We've all seen his dick.  Yeah.  We're not gay.  It's just what I do.  If you hang out with Jimmy, you see it.  Yeah, when you're friends, you just do it.  He's got a picture on it.  Why are you stopping now?  I'd be intimidated to show...  It's on your iPhone.  She did ask. 
[02:50:00]  No, I'm good.  I would never...  I could never show Linda Hogan.  By the way, this is what a phony I am to the people out there.  I said I never could, and I picked up the phone and hit the home button just in case.  Just don't put it on Twitter, okay?  No, I would love to Twitter.  I hug.  Now, there's obviously been weird...  You get weird allegations when you're a celebrity, and some of Hulk's old wrestling...  What is the thing with him and the Ultimate Warrior?  What is this dislike they have for each other?  You know, I don't know.  I think it's something stemming back from, you know, the ring, or I really don't know, 
[02:50:30]  you know, wrestling talk and stuff, what angles they had going.  But you know what?  I don't know him, and I've never met him.  He's never met my kids.  I'd see him from time to time at different, you know, wrestling matches where he'd be behind  the scenes with the war paint, but he seemed always very quiet and withdrawn.  He wasn't, like, one of the, you know, talkative, hey, guy, how's it going, you know?  So, you know, for him to come out and make all these kind of ridiculous allegations  is just a shock.  You've heard them, right?  Yeah. 
[02:51:00]  What he said?  Yeah.  And it's just, it's ridiculous.  I mean, it's a joke.  You know, I'm the only one that he hasn't slept with.  I'm like, well, I haven't slept with anybody but my husband for 24 years, so obviously...  So there was, I mean, threesomes are fine.  I've had a few.  They're terrific.  I mean, that wasn't part of it?  He's just making the whole thing up?  As far as I know, me and Terry were never into, I mean, I know I wasn't into threesomes  or foursomes or anything like that, you know?  Now, what he did on the side, because there was a lot of stuff that I didn't know,  I don't know that answer.  Yeah, because the warrior was making, the warrior, he was making allegations. 
[02:51:30]  I was monogamous, yeah.  That it was you.  But, you know, he had, if he wanted to get out there and let people know, you know, I'm  back, I mean, if he got out there and started picking on somebody like, you know, an undercard  guy that maybe was not such a big name, who would listen to him, first of all?  That's true, yeah.  He remembers who he is, so he has to pick on somebody, you know, to get the attention,  to grab the attention.  Yeah.  Do you feel like when you hear a guy, like, do you have any, I'm sure you do, but do you  have, like, a dislike or an allegiance to Hulk, or do you kind of get defensive of people  attacking him, or are you just so done at this point? 
[02:52:00]  You know what?  My kids, I've got two kids with him, you know, and we don't talk to each other.  He just, he would rather have it that way, so everything that we do has to go through  the lawyers.  But I'm sure the reason being is that he doesn't want to have to have any kind of a confrontation,  have to explain anything to him and account for any of the past actions, you know.  But I just try to keep things civil.  We've got two kids out there, but in my own heart, I've moved on.  That's what I talk about in my book. 
[02:52:30]  Wrestling the Hulk was my married life, and then now, I mean, I'm good.  I'm happy.  I've moved on.  I don't, yeah, I'm so done.  Are you jealous if he's with another woman?  I mean, do you still have that old?  No, he's remarried now, and I'm happy for him.  Good luck.  She looks kind of like you, right?  Well, I think she looks more like my daughter.  Oh, your daughter, your daughter, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, just like her daughter.  Is that creepy to you, like, when you see that?  Yeah, it's creepy to me.  I mean, she's not creepy.  I've never, I've only met her once. 
[02:53:00]  But, I mean, I'm just saying the fact that he would be with somebody that looks that much  like my daughter, yeah, it's very weird.  Now, because you don't think that that was any kind of an unconscious thing, or maybe,  right?  Well, I mean, you know, Holster has got a hankling for blondes, okay?  Everyone does.  I always thought blondes.  That's why it shocked me when I found out about him and Christiane, you know, because she was  definitely brunette and Brooke's friend.  Oh, was he hooking up with one? 
[02:53:30]  I don't know the story.  Yeah.  Yeah, he was.  She worked for the record label, and, you know, it was just convenient.  And I think that's the problem with these guys out there, these, you know, politicians  and athletes and, you know, even the royalty figures, you know, but they just, it's so easy  for them.  The girls throw themselves at them, and it's just there.  If you could have had sex with one pro wrestler other than Hulkster, who would it be?  Well, yes.  I mean, I always said it. 
[02:54:00]  I don't know if I could say it was a wrestler.  Chief J Strongbow?  Back in the day, it would have been David Lee Roth.  You could totally fuck him down.  You could fuck him down.  He's a mess.  He's available.  He's available.  We see him.  Ariel's across the stage.  I thought she was going to say George the Animal Steel.  Damn it.  Damn it.  I love him.  Watching him work that turnbuckle.  Do you like any blonde-haired guys with hair?  Yeah, Charlie.  You're still with Charlie?  Yeah, I'm still with Charlie.  You guys have been together a while now, right?  A couple years?  Yeah, three years.  Three years. 
[02:54:30]  Damn.  He's good.  I mean, he's fun.  I'm young.  I'm young at heart.  He's young.  And it's like, I keep up with that.  I just don't have anything in common with old guys.  I just, I'm over it.  I've been there, done that.  At the height of things, too, roughly, what was Hulk pulling in a year when things were  really good?  Great question, Jimmy.  Because we don't, we have no frame of reference for wrestlers, what they make or what they're,  I mean, we know what rock stars make, but what is a wrestler at the height of his game,  the number one guy pulling an estimate?  Well, you know, I mean, it was hard to tell because, I mean, it was just, there was income 
[02:55:00]  coming from a lot of different areas.  It wasn't, like, just all from a wrestling thing.  He had a lot of licensing out there and merchandising, and, you know, everybody had the  dolls, the sheets, the bed things.  Sure.  Just ask E-Rock how much money he spent.  Yeah.  If you had the ballpark.  Like, I did ballpark.  Because he bought a lot of Hulk stuff.  I would say probably between 15 and 20 million.  Wow.  A year?  A year.  God.  Yeah, Hulk was so marketed, though.  You're right, the dolls and all this stuff.  Oh, yeah.  And he was the only one, though.  I don't think that, you know, it was like there's a drop. 
[02:55:30]  Yeah, he was the big merchandise guy.  Right.  And Vince rolled with him, and they had a great thing.  You know, but that was the beginning of cable TV.  Yeah.  And they were able to bring wrestling into everybody's living room and, you know, make it  family entertainment, and it just went wild.  I mean, from the time I met him, you know, he was driving this 1979 Lincoln around.  It was all beat up and living in Minnesota.  And, you know, it wasn't like we had, you know, a lot of fancy stuff.  I mean, we were just starting out.  But, you know, a couple years into the marriage, it just went like wildfire. 
[02:56:00]  Did you get along with Vince?  Oh, I went to a lot of them, yeah.  Yeah?  No, you got along with Vince McMahon?  Did you get along with Vince McMahon?  Oh, did I?  Oh, yeah.  Vince and Linda are great people, you know.  They were always really nice to us.  In fact, you know, I always was a little bit different because Terry was always treated  so differently in the ring.  He was one of the stars.  He was the star.  Yeah.  And so they basically always included me in their little, you know, extra little box  seating and stuff like that.  So I had a little extra treatment.  But super nice lady.  She runs that whole company. 
[02:56:30]  Not like the Brooklyn Brawlers girlfriend.  What's that?  Not like the Brooklyn Brawlers girlfriend, you know.  Yeah, she sent them Brooklyn or something.  Oh, Chip.  I mean, yeah, there's been some times, you know.  I mean, usually while they were back there wrestling, I would sit on a forklift or something  in the back stages.  And I was just by myself, you know.  I went to all those wrestling matches.  We put miles, hundreds of miles in the car on the road.  Hmm.  Yeah, it was not.  But it was just kind of a, well, hang out until this is done.  Yeah.  Hey, I got to ask you about all the dead wrestlers. 
[02:57:00]  What's your thought on that?  I mean, you know most of these guys that have passed.  Seems like the number's way too high.  High mortality rate.  High mortality rate.  It is.  Is it the lifestyle?  Bert said pills.  What is going on?  It is the lifestyle, you know.  I mean, they're on the road.  It's a tough schedule.  They're on the road.  They're away from their families.  They're away from their wives.  You know, and you just start living in a hotel room.  And pretty soon you just kind of forget what you have at home. 
[02:57:30]  You've got to just kind of make do.  They're just together.  There's women at every port.  I don't know if that messes with their heads or they're just truly not happy.  But it's one of those things that you can't quit.  The money's so good.  You can't, you know.  Yeah, it's kind of hard to move on to something else.  And then that's what they do.  You know, so what are you going to do?  Go be a used car salesman or something?  Yeah, yeah.  It's just like they're a wrestler.  It's true.  We've had enough of the guys in and the schedule is brutal.  But I think because of their size and their weight, you know,  if a doctor gives you a prescription for a particular dose of medicine, 
[02:58:00]  it doesn't work on them.  I mean, they're so much heavier than most people.  It's like all horse.  Yeah, so they take a lot of it.  And I don't think a lot of them know their limitations.  And I think they just overdo it.  And they don't realize that that one time,  it's just going to be proved to be too, you know, to go work out.  And then they come home.  It makes them sweat.  It's just a...  Sweat on, like a nasty sweat?  Profusely.  Like, I mean, they're just always huffing and puffing and sweaty. 
[02:58:30]  And just, you know, it's an intensity, I guess,  that I can't really explain.  But it gives them that adrenaline and that rage.  And, you know, that's the thing in my book I want people to know about  is that I didn't want to be the recipient of a raging, you know, attitude.  If you had a fight that would escalate,  getting the last word in was not a smart thing to do.  You know, I mean, you just didn't want to perturb him.  Yeah, those big mitts would probably do some damage.  Oh, he's a very frightening dude. 
[02:59:00]  Was there ever any violence to ever get to that point?  Yeah.  Physical, yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, it wasn't like I was walking around with black guys like Mike Tyson,  but, you know, there were times that I just thought, you know,  okay, a squeeze on the arm really hard or a pushing with your finger  or a squeezing your face.  He squeezed your face?  Yeah, you know.  I was hoping you'd squeeze mine because she poked me,  and I liked Linda poking me.  It's like a bullying.  Yeah.  He'd goon arm you a little bit.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  And if you, you know, calling me dirty words and it's like names,  that's abuse. 
[02:59:30]  It is abuse at a certain level, and it can escalate.  And that's what women don't realize.  They just think that that's going to stay like that.  Well, you know, they get comfortable with that,  and then a little bit more, and then a little bit more,  and then what's next, you know?  Right.  If you see Sweaty Hulk come in, run.  Make sure dinner isn't late.  There were broken lamps and torn shirts and clumps of hair out of my head.  You know, that's not okay.  He pulled your hair?  Yeah.  When you were arguing to do what?  To stop you from leaving the room?  I don't think he meant it, but we were in a fight,  and it was pulling me around the room.  It was probably just Jules to the head of hair you got. 
[03:00:00]  Yeah.  I know, right?  Did he tape it on his own head?  Is he a smart guy?  He taped it on his own head.  That's funny.  Did you know he was done when he did the leg drop on you?  Was that like finally?  Well, that was his thing.  Fight's over.  Yeah.  It's like finally did the leg drop.  All right.  Allow me dinner.  I could finally take a shower.  Did you ever lift up his arm while he was sleeping  and see if he was like, oh!  One, two, one!  Is he a smart guy?  Yeah, he is. 
[03:00:30]  He's got to be.  Really?  No, he doesn't.  Why not?  No, he doesn't.  He doesn't need to be smart.  I mean, I think to last as long as he has,  I think you've got to be kind of smart.  Probably.  Well, he seems like he's smart in business.  I mean, let's put it this way.  I mean, he's not a meathead wrestler.  He's a wrestler, but he's also a businessman.  Yeah.  You should have had to sign a prenup,  but besides that, he seems smart.  Well, you never heard stories about how, you know,  he had a bunch of money and lost it,  aside from, you know, divorce.  Thanks, baby.  How much did you get?  How much did I get? 
[03:01:00]  Yeah.  Oh, in the divorce?  Yeah.  Oh, I can't say that stuff.  Wink it to me.  How about this?  Wink it to me.  Sign language?  Let me just ask you.  Can I say?  No, no, I'm not going to say anything.  I just wrote something down.  Can you just look at that and just tell me,  am I crazy?  I can't really say, you know, I mean, whatever we had, I got half.  I wrote down 20.  And why is he in the smaller house?  I think he just likes living small.  So it's a great house.  I like living large.  You know, I need a bigger house.  You've been in the Hulk house?  Oh, yeah.  Not in it.  Oh, you're Team Hulk. 
[03:01:30]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  No, I'm not Team Hulk.  I saw Hulk at, I think at, what's the, there's a restaurant in Clearwater one day?  And he's an impressive guy to see.  He really is.  I mean, he's in great shape.  His back is all fucked up.  You can tell because he's like limping.  Sorry.  But he's an impressive guy.  But I was neither a team at all.  You guys actually looked like, I flew on a song flight with you guys.  Oh, a song flight.  They used to rent out the entire, you guys would buy Rose. 
[03:02:00]  Yeah.  And so they, instead of flying first class, they end up first class.  So they buy Rose.  I was impressed, first of all, how you guys seem like a really tight family when I, when  I was, I was like sitting with you guys pretty much.  And I was really impressed at how pretty your daughter is.  Thank you.  She's overwhelming.  Like, she is what, she should be a movie star of like a fucking, like just gorgeous.  She just did a movie called Sand Sharks out in California.  It's for the Sci-Fi Channel.  It's a TV movie.  So she's doing a little acting.  I love, we love those.  Sand what?  Sand Sharks.  Sand Sharks. 
[03:02:30]  We love that.  It's cute.  It's a really cute film.  And Nick just got doing a part in another movie where he gets like, I guess, beat up by thugs  and taken away at gunpoint, you know, and he's, he's been down in a little bit of movies.  He's DJing right now.  He's had a rough few years, huh?  Yeah.  It's been tough.  You know, I mean, that's what happens.  You know, people don't realize that infidelity, you know, and then trying to live through that  and rebuild and then, you know, it just eventually, it just really doesn't work out. 
[03:03:00]  You try to pick up the pieces and start over again, but it's not, it's just something's  changed.  Could you have forgiven if it was only once or twice over the years?  Could you have forgiven it or was it always there?  Well, you know what the problem is, is that it's, it's not the act of the sex that they've  had.  It's not the actual act that's bugging you.  Okay.  I mean, he had sex with people before we got married.  It's not the fact that he had a sexual affair with somebody else.  It's, it's the lifestyle that it creates, the lies, the, you know, the, the mistruths  just, you know, you never know what to believe anymore. 
[03:03:30]  Is he really going to the store or is he, you know, what?  Right.  And then you're wondering if you're going to get a baseball bat to the back of your head.  From one of these gloves.  It's a secret life.  Right.  Yeah.  They lead a secret life away from you and it's just, you don't know what to believe anymore.  You just think like, okay.  So that's when I made my decision to say, you know what?  I, my life counts for something too.  I've stood by you.  So had I blown the whistle and, and made this a public whole thing back 10 years, you  know, at the 10 year mark, when I found out about his first affair, he had to admit to 
[03:04:00]  me, you know, I, he would not have had a career.  I mean, what happened that, that would have not have been okay for Hulk Hogan to be doing  that.  So, you know, I figured that, you know what, maybe it is the point where, you know, girls  throw themselves, maybe it wasn't all his fault.  I tried to do forgiveness and make things work, but got to a point where he's like, you  know, he's sitting there waiting for us.  He's like, I don't even care if you eat or not.  I'm like, you're mad.  But I tried to put the pieces back together.  And then, you know, you just sense it's happening again. 
[03:04:30]  You get those feelings.  And it's like, you can just pick it up, right?  It was happening.  I sensed it.  I asked Luke, I said, you don't think that him and Christiane or, oh, mom, no, no, she's  my friend.  How would you tell?  Would he drive her home and stuff like that?  Or was it like he'd pull in the driveway and sit there and talk on his cell phone for  like a half an hour.  And I would look out the window.  That's a dead giveaway right there.  Yeah.  Would you check the phone bill?  He had three cell phones.  Okay.  I opened the safe to go get my jewelry.  So wait.  It was full of cash. 
[03:05:00]  Like $50,000 of cash.  Wow.  Like, why do you need this much cash?  You know, well, if you're supporting a madame.  He had a couple of phones?  Three.  So he had like a good boy phone.  The one that I knew when the bill came home to me.  And another naughty boy phone.  And a naughtier boy phone.  He's definitely going to get brain cancer with that many phones.  Oh, you've got to watch out.  I mean, just, you know, too many, you know, and the signs were there, but, you know, I  put that in my book.  I do list the signs because a lot of women out there, you know, if you don't know what 
[03:05:30]  to look for, I list the signs and the emotions that I went through and I, you've  got to trust your heart of hearts, girls.  What do you say to all the Hulk fans?  All the Hulk fans?  They must hate you.  I do get a lot of people that are like, oh, I'm a gold digger and how can I do this  to Hulk, you know, and I'm not saying that I had a, you know, that I hate him or anything  else.  I mean, I had a wonderful marriage.  I married the guy.  I had kids with him, you know, but the one thing I want them to know is that there are  two sides to every story.  And I don't know what they would have done if they were in this situation, if their spouse 
[03:06:00]  or whatever is cheating on them and lying to you every day.  Do you guys ever videotape yourself having sex?  No.  Oh, really?  Jesus.  Well, when we first got married, we did.  And then it was on a beta.  Oh, God.  Shut up.  I would pay to see that.  I don't know.  You have to.  We thought, we can't leave this in the house.  What if we get on a plane?  Yeah.  All of a sudden, it's flying or something.  We put it on the barbecue and melted it.  Did you really?  Seriously.  Yeah, that was it.  Would it be nice, though, to see what you look like now? 
[03:06:30]  Like, look back at that and be like, oh.  We got a question from one of our audience members.  Yeah, this kid come in.  He's a Hulkamaniac.  He spent a lot of money on that merchandise.  He's from Florida.  Exactly.  You definitely contributed.  What kind of Hulk merchandise did you buy?  What's your name?  My name is Iraq.  Hi, Iraq.  Welcome to the show.  The Neck.  Born and raised in Florida?  No.  Long Island.  Oh, I thought they said you were from Florida.  They said you were from Florida.  Sam.  I'm from Long Island.  Okay.  No, I had the belt. 
[03:07:00]  I had the wrestling.  Look at Linda.  What's wrong?  Is she that pretty or something?  Look at Linda.  Look at her.  You don't have to look at me.  The big rubber figures from the 80s and things like that.  What about, like, sheets?  No, never had the sheets.  Oh.  Never had the sheets.  I never had, I wanted the pull-away shirt.  Oh.  Never got that.  Because every shirt you owned did that.  Did you know that was my idea?  Really?  That was your idea?  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  Was it really?  I was from California, and I had a beach cover-up, a t-shirt that was, I was cutting it with scissors, 
[03:07:30]  you know, and you stretch it and you pull it, and it was all shredded so that you could  see your bathing suit through it, but not really, you know, you weren't like a see-through  thing.  It just sexes everything out.  And we were in our kitchen in Minnesota, and, you know, I didn't know too much about  the wrestling, but Billy Graham's superstar back in the day was very flamboyant with  his boas and his bright pink color, so Terry said, you know, let me try that shirt  on.  And so I said, you want to try my shirt on?  And so it was a dress on me, but of course, when he put it on, his wide lats and stuff,  he just put it on, and the rips and stuff just shredded, and he dug the look. 
[03:08:00]  I was like, it does look pretty good.  So we started doing that to his wrestling shirts, where he would like the Hulk, you know,  the ripping out of the shirts and stuff, so that's how that whole thing started.  I was happy when they started mass producing them, because I was, like, every night cutting  up the T-shirts.  So you, you, and, you know, are you Team Hulk?  You're not mad that Linda's saying this stuff, but you're a hero.  No, I mean, she seems very nice.  Look her in the eye.  Look her in the eye.  Be a man.  Would you look?  She's a nice lady.  You seem very nice.  You've got a lot of Hulk stuff in your house.  I guess it's sad that the whole relationship fell apart. 
[03:08:30]  Stop sheepishly looking at the floor.  Shut up.  All right.  Look up.  Hey, hey, hey.  No, he's right.  I should.  What I want to know is, though, when you did split and you went, started going out with  Charlie, I'm sure you heard this a lot, but he looks just a younger version of your  husband.  So isn't that kind of weird to just go out with the same guy that you were already married  to?  What type of question is that?  Oh, come on.  No, no.  I've heard that before.  Ah, good.  You don't have to answer that.  Charlie has all his hair.  I mean, I don't see it.  I mean, I guess I do a little bit because, okay, they've both got blonde hair, you know, 
[03:09:00]  the blocked off short blonde hair.  But, you know, I was alone and lonely for nine months after I'd filed for divorce.  Terry was already living with Jennifer.  And, you know, I was like, what am I supposed to do?  You know, I wanted to.  But I just still felt bad being married, even though I wasn't living with him.  And we were going through the whole rigors of divorce.  I just felt like I shouldn't date until the divorce is final.  You know, I'm Catholic and the whole guilt trip.  And I'm like, but, you know, on the other hand, it's like everybody else does it. 
[03:09:30]  Yeah.  I need to say, you know, it was like, I need to meet somebody.  I need to go out.  Younger model.  My mother used to say if everybody jumped off a bridge, would you do it, Chip?  You know, I just was, I had been married to a famous person for a long time.  And there's, you know, they're gone.  They're busy.  They're doing their thing.  And I just really enjoy the fact that I, when I met Charlie, he was there for me.  He was just there to hang out.  And we, you know, did all the things that I wished I could have done with Terry.  Satisfy you.  Ride the bikes.  Eat A-Rock or Eric. 
[03:10:00]  You attacked Linda.  She's a nice woman.  You attacked her.  You attacked her.  I like that.  That was a very nice woman.  What's your favorite Hulk thing you got at your house?  Yeah.  Oh, I have.  It was a part two question, by the way.  It's the, I forgot the number, but the WrestleMania where he fought The Rock.  It's the jersey.  He signed that for me.  Oh, really?  He signed that for you, huh?  Yeah.  After all these years.  That's great.  That's wonderful.  I think I have a picture of him in my purse.  Yeah?  What kind of ring is that, by the way?  Just some decorative jewelry.  Oh, it's not a big fancy one? 
[03:10:30]  I couldn't tell if that was just a piece of costume.  What, are you going to rob her on the way out?  Maybe.  Ah.  Yeah.  Maybe I shake her hand and I take the ring.  That's what I do.  So, where are the kids at?  Nick is at home.  Huh?  No, I mean with this whole thing.  Oh, where are they at with this?  Do they take sides or are they cool now?  No.  I think they took sides for a while, right?  You know, in the very beginning when the divorce was going on, Terry and Brooke were doing  a TV show with VH1.  Brooke knows best down in Miami and, you know, Brooke had just found out about him sleeping 
[03:11:00]  with her girlfriend.  Jeez.  And she was really upset.  I mean, I basically, you know, I was not a stranger to that.  I had to kind of just take her and kind of make sure she was okay, you know, so.  How'd she find out?  How did they get confirmed?  You know, I went down to Miami to help her set decorate her little apartment for the show.  So, Christiane came over that night and, you know, we were just having some wine and some  drinks and it was Valentine's Day.  And then the next day I left, the cameras were going to come and I went home and she 
[03:11:30]  was filming that day with her dad.  That went good.  The second day, I guess one of her friends came up to her and said, you know, how's everything  going and stuff?  I mean, all that stuff with your dad and all.  She goes, what do you mean that stuff with my dad?  Oh, boy.  And he goes, well, I thought you knew.  And she goes, no, what?  He goes, you know, about him and Christiane.  She's like, what?  You know, and at that point then she found out and she thought back immediately what I  had sensed, you know, back at New Year's.  And I said, you know, I'm not surprised. 
[03:12:00]  I thought so.  But I really just needed to be there for her.  She was really crushed about that.  Yeah, that would probably do it.  And then I realized why my marriage sucked so bad that last year that I was like, all  the times that he said he was going to the recording studio, I'm like, was he really  there all night?  Right, right, right.  And he's a block away from solid gold, okay?  Yeah.  He's already running around like he's a jogger or something.  No.  We weren't focusing on the music.  Right.  Focusing on everything but.  Do you?  Oh, what?  No, no, no.  What?  Oh, shit.  Oh, no. 
[03:12:30]  Can I ask one final question?  Because Hulk's not here and we're getting one side of the story.  What would you say you could have done better in the whole marriage?  Ah.  Oh, good question.  Thank you, Bert.  Thank you.  Just, I mean, because it's hard because we don't get the other side of this.  And I don't think Hulk's going to be on our show anytime soon, so.  Well, no.  I mean, there are two sides, you know?  And, I mean, if you look back and you say, okay, could I have done something better?  I guess I could have probably addressed it in a civil way.  But, you know, I mean, at that point, you are just already so full of animosity and you 
[03:13:00]  know that you're getting duped.  You know, bringing anything up to him just caused a big fight, so I just couldn't bring  it up.  But, you know, I wish maybe I had talked about it earlier and maybe just addressed it with  him and said, are you having your own affair?  Right.  Instead of letting it build up.  Yeah.  For a long time.  Look, I got to say, I think this book's going to be really good.  What I've read of it is fucking great.  I mean, it's very honest.  You're being open and honest about things.  You don't get that a lot of times.  Yeah, you answered everything.  It's really great.  When people come in and they tell all books and they don't want to say anything. 
[03:13:30]  Well, I kept a diary, you know, for the kids all these years, but I had a lot of the  stuff written down.  It almost became my diary, you know?  Right.  So when I went to go write the book, it was easy to recount the situations and the feelings  and the emotions that I was going through at the time because I had my, you know, my journal.  But, yeah, I wrote it heartfelt.  I felt that's just my accounting, my, from my point of view, that's how I felt throughout  the marriage.  Well, tonight, the book is called Wrestling the Hulk and it's Linda Hogan's book.  It's very honest.  And you can get assigned 7 o'clock if you're in Jersey at Bookends, which is a great independent 
[03:14:00]  place.  It's in Ridgewood.  It's on 211 East Ridgewood Avenue.  A lot of you have already been there, so you know where it is.  It's a great place because there's a lot of room to stand indoors.  You're not going to get a great place.  Right.  You're selling the place.  I like to let people know because who hasn't gotten wet in the rain?  Put your hand up.  I rest my case.  My very first book signing.  Yay.  Everybody, buddy, found.  Yeah.  Good luck.  You're very nice.  Thank you.  Linda Hogan.  I wish you weren't taken.  You're very sexy.  Very good. 
[03:14:30]  She's sexy, right?  Linda, you're sexy.  But, like, she'd go for me.  Imagine if you went from Hulk Hogan to this.  What a great story that would be.  I used to the bald.  Oh, thank you.  She gave my head a rub, but not a sexy rub.  Like, I'll look at the little dog rub.  And you're right.  Take a look at the picture.  No peanut there.  You good?  No more questions?  No, it's a pleasure.  You're kind of a fixture of Tampa.  Your family was.  And it's a pleasure meeting you.  You're a fantastic lady.  Thank you, guys.  And your show's on tomorrow.  We're closing up.  Yeah, I think we're going to close up.  Wednesday nights at 10.  You should watch my show on Travel Channel.  I love to.  Henry Winkler's a big fan. 
[03:15:00]  Oh, Travel Channel.  Birth to Conquer.  Birth to Conquer at 10 o'clock on Travel Channel.  We'll do it.  We're good.  I think that's it.  Thank you.  Linda Hogan.  Thanks a lot.  Thank you.  Bye.  See you tomorrow.  This is the O'BnA Show.  O.B. and Anthony.  O.B. and Anthony.  All the violence.  Sirius XM. </pre>
