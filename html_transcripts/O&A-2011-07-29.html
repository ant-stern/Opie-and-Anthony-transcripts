<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with Larry King's intro, immediately transitioning into a post-mortem of their recent live show in front of a 450-person audience.  Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton dissected the performances of their staff, praising E-Rock's confident set, Sam and Travis' storytelling, while harshly criticizing Bobo's rambling, unfunny performance.  Troy Kwan's set received mixed commentary, with one joke specifically highlighted. The hosts noted the younger audience demographic, speculating on the reasons behind this shift given the show's longevity.  A significant portion of the discussion centered on Chip's nine-and-a-half-minute online video, considered a potential TV pilot.  The possibility of a staff and friends roast was also floated.  A letter from a listener hoping to secure a SiriusXM job for her daughter dominated a portion of the segment. The hosts played a guessing game to determine the letter's sender, ultimately revealed to be Bill Donahue, president of the Catholic League. They also discussed a suggestive "American Pickers" commercial and played a humorous outtake.

The conversation then shifted to Bill Donahue,  highlighting their complicated history stemming from the "Sex for Sam" incident.  The hosts joked about helping Donahue's daughter, Caitlin, get a job at Sirius as "ultimate vengeance." The discussion took a sexually explicit turn, featuring graphic descriptions of sexual positions and anecdotes about sneaking into R-rated movies and engaging in sexual activity in theaters. This transitioned into a somber discussion of recent suicides, including Olympic skier Jarrett Peterson.  A caller, Ursula, shared her heartbreaking story of her husband's suicide, prompting a conversation, punctuated by morbid jokes from the hosts, about grief and guilt.

The show continued with more discussions of suicides among the hosts' acquaintances, particularly comedians, followed by commentary on viral videos â€“ a woman driving with her hood up and a man pulling shopping carts with a lawnmower.  A planned staff lunch and Roland's difficult-to-understand stand-up set were briefly mentioned.

The next segment began with discussion of a Casey Anthony latex mask, followed by more viral video commentary.  Listeners' submissions, including "Jerry Mandarin's" police traffic stop videos, provided comedic relief. They also discussed a new "American Pickers" commercial parody.  Andrew Dice Clay's return to smoking was criticized, leading to a graphic discussion of toilet cam videos.  Anthony's Twitter feud with a Seahawks fan, "Jeff," sparked a debate on "true" vs. "fair-weather" fans, evolving into a lengthy rant about his negative experiences with the New York Islanders organization, culminating in a vow to oppose public funding for their new arena.  A caller, Brian, shared similar grievances.  The segment ended with discussions of a video comparing beer cup sizes and a story about hidden cameras in a Tampa apartment, before introducing UFC fighter Rashad Evans.

The interview with Rashad Evans covered various topics, from sleeplessness before fights and weight-cutting methods to anecdotes from past fights, including a humorous moment involving Forrest Griffin's hairy chest and a near-loss due to a lapse in concentration.  He described the physical and emotional tolls of fighting, his relationship with other fighters (including his dislike for Jon Jones), and the unpredictability of MMA. Rashad discussed his large family and his childhood experiences being beaten up by his older brothers, explaining how this shaped his fighting career.  He highlighted the UFC's encouragement of fan interaction and his willingness to take photos with fans.  The interview concluded with Rashad demonstrating an arm triangle choke on Opie.

A subsequent segment featured Rashad Evans demonstrating various wrestling holds, including an arm triangle and a triangle choke, on Sean, with graphic descriptions of the sensations involved.  They discussed the techniques, escape methods, Sean's upcoming fight, and speculated on future UFC matchups, promoting UFC 133.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Hi, this is Larry King welcoming you to the Opie and Anthony show right here on Sirius XM's Satellite Radio.  What the hell am I doing here?  Isn't it brilliant?  I should get it. The thing's out of control. Out of control.  Great guests, interesting interviews, and of course, your phone calls as well.  It gets my nipples hard. You know what I mean, son?  Are you out of your mind?  It's not the most talked about, not the most written about, certainly not the most listened to a show in the history of radio, but I'm still proud to enjoy it.  Oh, you're going to have a ball. 
[00:00:30]  Yeah, you're good.  America's most trusted name in news, the Opie and Anthony radio show.  Let's welcome our hosts, Opie and Anthony.  By the way, who's Jim Norton?  Oh, my God.  Why? Why are we even here today after the brilliance of yesterday's program?  My God, man.  What a good one.  We're just stupid.  What a bunch of kudos we got.  No one would have cared if we took today off. 
[00:01:00]  Nope, they'd have understood.  Said, wow, you know, they gave it to him.  Yep.  We knew how to, I think we brought it, as, you know, certain people say.  I think it was brung.  I think it was broughten?  It was broughten.  I think it was broughten.  Oh, it was broughten.  That's right.  Yeah, it was good.  Yeah, it was a lot of fun.  I want to say hi to everyone we met.  Holy shit.  We didn't get out of there until after 11.  That was nice.  I was like, yeah, we'll sign a few things, take a few pictures. 
[00:01:30]  Felt like the old days.  Over an hour later, it's like, when is this line ending?  My God, Matt.  Yeah.  Sorry you were being shuffled through quickly.  Kenny is a pro.  It was getting a little out of control.  Kenny's a pro at that.  Move along.  Stop the chit-chat.  Tell your story.  Walk in.  I love that one.  But Ross was actually way worse than Kenny yesterday.  He was.  He was literally shoving people.  Ross, what's his gig here? 
[00:02:00]  Just for the people that.  He's head of talent and head of sales promotions.  And Howard Stern's best friend.  Well, yes, he has friends at Howard Stern.  That's right.  Well, that's correct.  I didn't know he was head of sales until the day.  I think he wears a bunch of hats.  Yes, he's big jobs.  And he was beyond cool yesterday.  I'm not trashing anyone today.  Everyone was great yesterday.  And Ross leaned into me and Ant.  I think Jimmy was a little further away.  So I don't know if you heard this.  If you did, he leans into us like, you want me to move this along? 
[00:02:30]  I'm like, oh, yeah.  Move it along.  He fucking went and took.  Oh, yeah.  All right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right.  Pushing people.  Right.  At first, we were set up a little weird, too.  The pictures weren't on the right table.  They can't divvy up the pictures between you and me.  They just can't do that.  Because people come over to me.  Can I get a picture?  And then I sign it.  And then I got to hand it over to Opie, who's signing one that he's crossing it over to me. 
[00:03:00]  So they all got to, like, go on Opie's table first.  And some people didn't understand that.  And then we were just rapid fire signing him, piling him up.  And people still standing there with empty pictures going, could you sign it?  I was like, for some reason, because then Ross goes, you can either have a picture or a picture taken.  Wow.  And I go, no, Ross, in between, like, them getting in position for pictures, we could certainly sign these pictures that they already have made.  We finally got a system down. 
[00:03:30]  But the problem was then some of the listeners are looking at the pictures that are signed thinking that they're, I don't know, they were stamped or something.  There for someone.  And they needed it signed in front of them.  Yeah, they wanted to see it.  No, we signed this literally 10 seconds ago.  It's okay.  You can have that.  And then there's another traffic jam up because the people that were getting pictures taken were going in between me and Opie.  And then we couldn't cross the pictures over for me to sign.  And so it was a little logistically fucked up. 
[00:04:00]  Jimmy Norton was being oh so adorable with every picture that was taken.  He was leaning his head on my shoulder.  He was scratching the back of my neck.  I said, I want our ears to touch.  Yeah, he goes, I want our ears to touch.  So I felt this little ear on my ear with some pictures.  It was pretty homoerotic.  You feel me with my nose air on your neck?  Yes.  Then at one point, one guy's taking the picture, and he's going like, okay, one, two, three.  And Jimmy just goes, and breathes out of his nose right down my neck. 
[00:04:30]  That's great.  Very satisfying.  Very satisfying for you.  Yeah, so there are a lot of gay pictures out there.  But the broadcast itself was, wow.  I went great.  I listened to the replay.  I think we might start, I don't know, doing live broadcasts again.  You know what?  Chop them down at two hours like that.  Two, two and a half.  Maybe three.  Nothing planned.  I think that was the first live broadcast where we actually had a schedule of things  that we were planning to do. 
[00:05:00]  That we wanted to do.  It wasn't just like, oh, let's try to do a regular studio broadcast in front of an audience.  Nothing worse than making things up as we go.  Yeah.  I mean, we do that here.  We're doing it right now.  But we don't have a, you know, how many people were there?  450.  450 was the official count?  Yeah.  I thought they would allow in.  450 in and that was, that was actually a little over what their capacity was.  Nice.  You know, so, yeah, we, I don't know, it was slick too.  There was no technical problems. 
[00:05:30]  Everyone did their jobs.  It went really nicely.  Crowd was great too.  They were very, very, they had good energy and they were receptive.  They weren't animals at all.  And it wasn't, yeah, it wasn't just a complete bash fest when anybody got up on stage.  Well, are, are the listeners maturing a little bit?  No, because they're younger.  What's going on?  I don't know what happens with our show.  That used to just be like, that would have been, all right, here's like Stalker Patty.  Fuck that, God, you suck.  But it was like, wow, they actually allowed her to get on mic. 
[00:06:00]  No, why?  Because there was no booze.  You think the booze puts them all over the top?  We were all really mad.  Like, you got to let our listeners drink if they want to drink.  But I think in the end, maybe that was the smart thing for this broadcast.  That's like the Jekyll and Hyde formula for our listeners.  I noticed one thing.  We continue to broadcast the same demo.  Yeah.  But we're getting old, man.  Yeah, and they're just.  Like, they're all in their 20s.  I'm like, what the fuck?  That is odd. 
[00:06:30]  And we've been doing this for 17 years.  So 17 years ago, we were talking to people in their 20s.  Where are those people?  They're in their 40s now.  Where are they?  Did you think that neither of you has matured?  Maybe that's part of the issue.  Yeah, that's probably the problem.  Is that what happens, you think?  But a lot of other radio shows.  Thank you, Jimmy.  But a lot of radio shows, the audience grows with them, usually.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like, if you go to an Imus fucking live broadcast, what a fucking disaster that is.  They all look dead.  Because they're all now really old like Imus.  Should be at a home. 
[00:07:00]  But for some reason with us, it's the same age constantly.  Yeah.  Really strange.  Which is good, you know, for the girls and stuff.  Yeah.  Well, there were a few girls there, too.  Oh, yeah, you old bag.  A few girls.  Yeah.  A few girls.  Beautiful girls.  A few girls.  I wonder why that is, though.  I don't know.  It's a good question.  I don't know why.  It's very strange to me.  They are the same as they were 10 years ago since I've been here.  When you look at them, it looks the same as it would have 10 years.  They don't look older.  A lot of radio shows that have staying power, I'm telling you, the audience just grows with you. 
[00:07:30]  And for some reason, I think after a while, maybe our listeners have to grow up and they  go, all right.  It was fun, guys.  But this young 22-year-old kid will take my place now.  It is kind of a, you know, we're very familiar with satellite radio.  We've been in it and had it for years.  But I think it is still kind of a younger demo media.  It's not like some guy in his fucking 50s and 60s, for the most part, going out and buying  satellite radio. 
[00:08:00]  Oh, and this guy's saying, oh, the 35 to 40-year-old works.  That's a good point, too.  That's a really good point.  You couldn't get there as a kid.  Well, you know, you can't just take a day off.  I mean, some people, I'm sure, did.  But in general, you're not going to take a day off, right?  Whatever.  It was a great broadcast.  The staff, you know, because everyone was coming up to me saying, good job.  I'm like, I didn't do shit yesterday.  That was an easy one.  Just kind of sit back and let it all kind of happen in front of you.  We ramble on.  Yeah, we rambled a little bit. 
[00:08:30]  But the staff all did great with their stand-ups.  Oh, yeah.  Everyone came to the table.  I thought there would be at least one guy that said, fuck this.  I'm just going to make it up as I go along.  Riff.  But everyone was prepared.  Yeah, yeah.  Some more than others, I'll tell you that.  That fucking Roland.  Oh, my God.  I was listening to a little Roland on the way in.  Yeah.  That was playing when I was driving in.  It's just hysterical.  And the words that I just could not understand that he's saying, people are just laughing 
[00:09:00]  with and at him at the same time.  He pulled it off, though.  But I had to say the star of the night as far as stand-up goes had to be our own E of  the rock.  Yeah.  He had the moves.  He had the confidence.  And the material.  It was right there.  I think these guys saw as it went on that it wasn't...  Like, I didn't want to see anyone get...  Like, if someone had bombed, it was funny.  But I didn't want to see anybody get humiliated.  So it was kind of fun to jump in and talk a little bit. 
[00:09:30]  And, like, Sam and Travis went long form.  Like, they...  Boy, did they.  But it wasn't...  Oh, sorry, Sam.  You're right here.  Come on.  But it was like the way you would tell a story on the radio.  It's just a different medium.  Yeah, yeah.  And you get used to...  It's just one of those things where if you go on stage, say, five or ten times, you go,  oh, okay, I have to put the laugh here and not there because...  Whatever.  It's just, like, from doing it.  But I thought it was good.  And everybody did their own thing.  Oh, yeah.  They're all funny dudes.  It's like, you guys are not going to go up there and just fucking suck.  Yeah.  No, they all were great. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah, you all got something funny.  They all pulled it off big time.  I mean, E-Rock was walking around that stage like he was a comedian.  Oh.  The cock of the walk, I'll say.  He was the cock of the walk.  E-Rock had a victory, finally.  Jeez.  Finally, right?  That's all I've ever wanted from the fucking kid is to fight back and have a victory.  It was like watching Rudy.  Yes.  Right, except spelled with a D.  That's like a piece of shit.  And then listening to the replay of the entire event yesterday, because my girl couldn't stay 
[00:10:30]  for the whole thing, so she wanted to listen to the replay, got home, she had it on, and  Chip tagging everybody's funny line was hilarious.  Yeah, just a joke thief.  It didn't matter.  You know, June, whatever happens like that.  It was like everyone that was sitting there that had any line that came out, Chip had 
[00:11:00]  a tag.  My favorite Chip tag was when Kenny did the joke about the woman in the airplane wanting  to feel like a woman, so the man took his shirt off and said, all right, here, iron this.  And then Chip jumped in over the laugh and said, or you could have her throw it in a washing  machine or something.  Jesus.  This guy who doesn't get it.  Tagged everyone's jokes.  It was great. 
[00:11:30]  I'm hearing rumors there might be a Chip video.  I mean, I'm just saying this for the audience.  I actually, it's a nine and a half minute video on YouTube.  Wow.  That's completely insane.  You do know that.  It's an online TV show pilot that Chip is working on.  Oh, okay.  Chip TV show.  It's on YouTube.  A lot of people have seen it already.  It needs work, but I mean, there's parts two and three coming up and there will be more  of Chip TV show.  And they're all going to be nine and a half minutes?  Oh, yeah.  As long as we can.  I mean, the sitcom's 22 minutes and I figure this is just chock full of smart questions. 
[00:12:00]  You know, there's a lot of people out there.  If you make a video that's more than a minute, they won't even fucking push play.  We're going for 30.  30 minutes?  I would love to.  We're going to try.  We're going to probably end up with 25 once all three parts are together.  A solid 25.  But they're meant to be watched back to back.  Back to back to back?  Yes.  But you want to watch for the, I don't know, should we break it up into more video?  Maybe we should.  I don't know.  Let's do it well so far.  I mean, see what happens.  I figure we'll put on three long parts and then if we want to, if it's a real hit, here 
[00:12:30]  and there, we'll just throw in a little boom, boom, like 30 seconds of Chip.  I really wanted to go to Chicago tomorrow to watch Fedor fight.  I would love to have interviewed a few people there.  You know, just send Chip everywhere.  Make the whole thing a write-off.  I thought we were supposed to go.  Are we looking into this?  I haven't checked for flights.  Maybe we could try to do this.  I'll fly, would you?  I would love to fly tomorrow morning.  We could share a room and...  Yeah, why not?  A little massage room, we'll call it.  That's good.  A little work detention out room.  Fucking Jimmy, at one point I wrote, you want to kiss? 
[00:13:00]  Oh, yeah.  Because we didn't have much to do, so I was writing notes to Jimmy.  I go, you want to kiss?  And he goes, badly.  Badly.  And I got all creeped out.  My little fun little line just creeped me out.  Oh, Jimmy.  He just made it so real.  Yeah, he'll make a line like that backfire right in your face, along with a bunch of jizz.  I was having so much fun.  I'm like, I'll write this to Jimmy.  You want to kiss?  And he just leans over, badly.  Oh, he...  Danny did a callback yesterday. 
[00:13:30]  What was the callback?  Yes.  The jockey did...  Foot panties.  Foot panties.  He was like, yeah, I put them on my socks.  Well, foot panties, sorry.  Before we move on, the Chip TV link is on our Facebook page, which is Opie and Anthony.  Facebook slash Opie and Anthony.  And like we said, this is part one of probably three, so part two will be up maybe today or  sometime over the weekend.  Right on.  All right.  Ratspit from Vegas.  Opie, where did Troy Kwan get the mohawk wig? 
[00:14:00]  It's all his.  It's all his, people.  I was proud of Troy Kwan.  He was funny, yeah.  I thought he was going to try to beat up the audience.  He decided not to, which is nice on his part.  I'm curious to how the guys all felt about it.  How did you feel doing it?  Like, you know, Sam, you're right here.  So how was it?  I felt much more comfortable on stage than I thought I was because I was prepared for a  not as pleasant response from the crowd.  Yes, yes.  But, I mean, the crowd seemed into it, not into what I was doing, but like if I had done  good material, they would have been there with me. 
[00:14:30]  So I felt good talking to them.  I felt comfortable on stage.  That was good.  Yeah.  And I felt that my material got what it should have gotten.  Well, it wasn't that it was bad or uninteresting stuff.  It was, I think a lot of people, because they're radio fans, knew Travis's story about the kick,  and they knew your story about the circumstances because they're fans of the show, and you  told it in a way that you would just tell them on the radio show.  You're like a Bill Cosby.  That's how I see myself.  Sitting there going, look, it was 1965 when I met my wife, Camille, and we decided. 
[00:15:00]  And you're just sitting there going, all right, get to the point.  Bill Coxkin, actually, because he talked about circumcision.  He's a terrific storyteller, though, that Cosby.  Yes, he is.  He's terrific.  Oh, jeez.  Yeah, I thought it was great.  I thought it was great from everyone's standpoint.  Troy's joke was very funny about folding over the flap.  Yeah, fat.  That was very good.  It was despicable and true. 
[00:15:30]  Where did you get that line from?  That was too good.  I don't know, because.  Where's Troy?  I bet he wrote it, and it was good enough that he had a long setup that was kind of  verging on Sam and Travis territory.  Right.  But then that joke completely saved him.  Yeah, it did.  That might have been the joke of the night, or the day, whatever.  That was a good one.  Whenever we broadcast, I don't know anymore.  I don't know.  It feels like the middle of the night sometimes.  E-Rock's Opie joke, to be all fair.  Oh, yeah.  I think that one got the most attention.  Yeah, that killed, obviously.  That got the most attention.  Because it's so true. 
[00:16:00]  We should get Danny also in track.  I want to hear for everybody here, how everybody felt.  How did you feel?  It was fine.  I mean, I've been playing in bands since I was 13, so being on a stage was okay.  And I've been in bands that tries to get an uncomfortable reaction out of people.  So, I mean, that part was fine.  But I don't ever want to do that again.  Was that your joke?  What's that?  The folding over the fat?  I got a little help with my jokes.  Fair enough.  That was a great line.  Bunched up a little bit. 
[00:16:30]  Yeah.  There's big-time fucking comedians that get help with their jokes.  Yeah.  Of course.  When these guys host these award shows, that's not their material.  Yeah.  They get a whole bunch of writers.  Yes.  Nick Voss.  I never knew that, really, growing up.  I figured if you were a funny guy and they want you to host, that you could almost figure  it out on your own.  Maybe get a little help here and there.  But no, they get a whole staff of writers.  It is a scary thing, though, because when you're in a band, you have other musicians  on stage.  You have instruments.  You can sort of...  If they can pick up the slack a little bit. 
[00:17:00]  But to just stand out there with a microphone and just expose yourself like that, that's  a fucking scary thing.  And you realize how talented these guys are that are doing it.  But you guys all looked comfortable, though.  Fuck yeah.  All you guys...  Nobody up there looked terrible.  And it was like, you guys all carried yourselves really well.  You should feel good about it, because none of you panicked.  None of you fucking fell apart.  I mean, if you forgot a joke or whatever, but nobody fell apart and fucking... and fucked  up.  Danny.  And everybody knew how to take a bomb. 
[00:17:30]  Everybody did.  I think being like, you know, working for the show and just, you know, grabbing Mike  here and there, I think that kind of helps, too.  Yeah.  You get all that out of the way.  And we've all bombed horribly in front of all of you.  Yeah.  And bombing is something where, like, if this was one of those shows where everyone fake  laughed over everything anybody said, it would probably be horrific to go on stage and have  an audience just be like, find out you're not funny.  And you'd be like, now what do I do?  But because of this dumbass show, you look and you go, yeah, that one sucked. 
[00:18:00]  Yeah.  You're like, you embrace the bomb.  I felt far stupider on this show than I did at any point on stage yesterday.  Well, you should.  You were a little nervous to go up there, right, Travis?  Leading up to the event?  No.  You weren't happy that you had to do it.  It's just that, yeah, like, you have to do it.  And, you know, it's not something that you want to do, but you do it.  But the second you get up there, it's like, you don't even think about it anymore, which  I was really surprised about, just like Sam said.  You guys gave us a day off yesterday, thank you.  Yeah, it was fun to watch.  I really felt like we were just sitting back and watching something. 
[00:18:30]  That was great.  And your closing line, Danny, your closing line, you got, believe me, we've all done this,  where you got the big laugh, like two lines before the close.  And then, I always think of Florentine, because I do this a million times, where I go, Gary  Greedy, when I just, I do two more jokes all the time, you do that, and then you're like,  what did you say?  But you addressed it at the last line, you're like, that was, I was hoping for a big laugh.  Well, it sucks to bomb on your clothes, on your clothes, yeah.  And it was funny, because, like, Jim's like, oh, you know, he's like, you're over, and I  was like, well, and I knew I had, you know, just some more shit going on, so I was like, 
[00:19:00]  I might as well finish it, you know.  So I just should have, I should have just bailed while I was ahead.  No, but I like that you wanted to finish, I like that you weren't, I like that he wasn't  looking to get off immediately.  Fuck yeah.  I respected that, it was like, you really wanted to do your stuff.  Well, you know what, it's like, I had some jokes, I want to see what would happen.  Yeah.  Now I know, never do them again.  No, you can do it again, though.  You guys, I'm telling you, man, you guys were all funny guys, I was, you should feel good  about it, because that's a fucking rough thing, if you're not, especially with that potential  of that audience to be terrible.  It was really, for me, I can't speak for anyone else, but it was incredibly terrifying, 
[00:19:30]  and when I say that it's one of my biggest fears, like, that's no joke, it was definitely  one of my biggest fears, and not only that, but like, if I was up on stage at like some  open mic on a Wednesday night, like, it would have been just as much fear, so it was even  more so, you know, in front of fans, 450 people, you guys are there, it sucked, man.  Now let me ask you a question, any of you guys want to continue doing this, maybe do  it in open mic or something?  Fuck no?  Troy says fuck no.  Would you try it again? 
[00:20:00]  I would try it again.  I think Danny would.  Yeah, I think so, too.  I want to be able to do it without staring at paper and looking at people, that's all.  Yeah.  How about E-Rock, would you try it again?  I don't think so.  E-Rock, you...  Ah, E-Rock's retiring after one set.  The champion retires with the belts.  Where's Roland?  Oh yeah, Roland fucking around.  I haven't seen Roland yet.  Hold on.  Uh-oh.  Roland also, I'll say Roland's joke about Travis, no offense to Travis, was also one  of the big laughs.  That was a huge laugh.  When he said, Travis is the skinniest guy on staff, I could never keep up with his diet 
[00:20:30]  because I can't just sit drinking cum all day.  And the thing is, like, you know, everybody, I think, was trying to decide whether or not  to, like, work blue or, you know, try to...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So, you know, I had a whole bunch of blue stuff and I was like, no, I'm not going to do  that.  No, I'm going to keep it clean.  Sure enough, the cum eating joke gets a big pop.  But then Roland did another cum joke right after.  It was like, Roland, yeah, I forget what it was.  It was Danny.  That's New York.  That's New York.  That's New York.  Yeah. 
[00:21:00]  I thought Roland was going to be a complete disaster up there.  I really did.  I thought you were just going to fall apart.  Yeah, me both.  No, but you fucking pulled it off.  You enjoyed it?  You did good.  He handled it.  And you looked way more confident on stage than I thought you would.  He handled it.  Yeah, it's called alcohol.  Yeah, there was also a funny thing going on with a certain group of staff members trying  to get a hard rock Johnny like, look, I know you don't serve before noon, but you've got  to give me something.  From what I hear, and I'll use the rules that firing squads use, where they give one guy 
[00:21:30]  the empty magazine so as to never know if he might be the one or one of the other guys  that didn't shoot the round.  I'll say that one person didn't drink before they went out.  That's obvious.  Well, you don't know.  It's not obvious.  It's plausible deniability is what I'm going for you.  Fair enough.  But everyone else had to fucking blast one down before they went out there.  A little glass of courage.  All right, one.  Yeah, he doesn't care. 
[00:22:00]  Two doubles.  I thought.  Oh, yeah, they were drinking.  I would have guessed two on staff.  I had four or two shots.  Oh, wow.  I was ready to go.  Wait, even E-Rock?  I had two shots of Jack.  Oh, shit.  I had no idea.  It was possible deniability.  I was drinking bourbon with a straw.  Trying to get a head rush for the straw.  Troy, did you drink?  I would never do that.  Troy.  Wait, you didn't drink?  I'd never drink before I got on stage.  Never.  I didn't do anything. 
[00:22:30]  I know Sam didn't drink, so there were two on staff that didn't drink.  I don't think I ever got on stage without drinking.  So it's half the guys.  All right.  Well, Troy, being in the bands, you're probably used to going on sober.  And those fucking hardcore crowds are animals worse than our fans are.  Because I want to feel like I'm in control.  When I'm drunk, I get crazy.  Really?  Yeah, I get out of hand.  That works.  That whole thing works so well.  I think eventually we do it again.  But next time, I think these guys roast us in front of everybody.  That'd be great.  Because when E-Rock was kind of roasting me, I'm like, fuck yeah. 
[00:23:00]  Because everyone's like, oh, is Hope you're going to be mad at E-Rock?  Fuck no.  I want this kid to fight back.  That's all I ever wanted.  I'll say it again.  But if we get these guys all roasting us in front of a fucking live audience, that could  be a lot of fun.  That'd be huge.  Just staff, stand up staff, making love.  And then afterwards, we all jerk off together.  Do you imagine the disaster if that was our closer?  If everyone just started jerking off, like how awkward it would be for the crowd to leave  and how they'd try to close the curtain at the heart of a...  What are they doing? 
[00:23:30]  We'd just make a jizz fountain in front of everybody.  I love the idea of them fucking just shredding us.  Yeah, because we can't just redo what we just did, but that would be a nice take.  That's a good one.  Yeah, absolutely.  Didn't they talk about an Opie and Anthony roast or something at one point?  We had discussed that.  I think that'd be a fun fucking...  Get these guys and people that are close to the show.  We've been talking about that, honestly, for 10 years.  We should do that.  And I think it just scares us, so we've never pulled the trigger.  Okay, it's fun.  We start talking about that at any W, I know. 
[00:24:00]  Get guys like Bobby and Voss and Patrice and guys that are close.  Oh, that could completely rip us apart.  Yeah.  Yeah, that'd be good.  But that's who you want.  Kenny, all the guys that we're close to.  Kenny.  Believe me, Bobo and Patty would be great.  Just because it'd be so awful.  One of the funniest fucking things with Bobo yesterday was when Jimmy just goes,  You're panicking!  What was he doing?  I do feel like we're not crediting Bobo for his three minutes.  Wow, that was an amazing three minutes. 
[00:24:30]  You mean when Bobo came up at the Art of Art Cafe?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Welcome to Art of Art Cafe!  And he just doesn't connect with the audience.  No, no.  He doesn't connect with anybody.  We slowed him down.  We told him, he's soulless.  When Bobo did a seven-minute set at a comedy club, it was two and a half minutes.  When he came up to do a three-minute set, it was six and a half.  Yeah.  It was that long?  It was six and a half minutes yesterday.  Oh, God, he sucked yesterday.  He was so bad. 
[00:25:00]  And also, for one-man band, he whips out one frying pan and an empty plastic bottle.  Yeah, he finally has a chance to do this bit that, the one bit that has worked in the last six months with him.  And, yeah.  He shows up like that.  He's banging a balloon into a cotton ball.  Fucking idiot.  Not disturbing anyone.  And his stories were, oh, God, just horrid.  Then again, we're acting surprised that a potential autistic wasn't a good stand-up.  Well, he aspires to be. 
[00:25:30]  Yeah.  He better hope that's all it is.  Yeah.  That was just, it was just dreck.  Oh, it really was horrid.  Patty was pretty good, though, too, singing.  Like, she was, even though she's, what was the line she was?  Unfortunately, that was stuck in my head, Patty's version, all night.  I just kept going around going, no, no, no.  No, no, no, no.  How is she saying that in go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.  She always does something weird when she sings that just fucking repeats on you.  Oh, she does.  And she completely had no idea what the verses sounded like at all. 
[00:26:00]  No, no, she was winging it.  She only listened to it ten times, she said.  Halfway into the verse, she was ready to do the next hook.  Yeah, all she wanted to do was the hook.  No, no, no.  No, go, go, go, go.  They tried to make me go to rehab, but I said no, no, no.  No.  Yes, I've been back.  It's time that my daddy thinks I'm fine.  He's tried to make me go to rehab, but I won't go, go, go. 
[00:26:30]  Go, go, go.  I'd rather be at home with Ray.  I ain't got 70 days.  Because there's nothing, there's nothing you can teach me  that I can't learn from Mr. Hathaway.  I didn't get a lot in class, but I know it don't come in a shot glass.  They tried to make me go in a shot, in a shot glass. 
[00:27:00]  They tried to make me go to rehab.  She says enough.  That's the only one who's used to sing it, by the way.  In her career.  I said enough.  The words.  You tried to make me go to rehab, but I said no, no, no.  No.  Yes, I've been black, but when I come back, you'll know, no, no.  I ain't got the time. 
[00:27:30]  And if my daddy thinks I'm fine, you tried to make me go to rehab.  I won't go, go, go.  Go.  I want another version of that from Patty.  I don't know why I enjoy that.  There's something about her voice.  It's like I don't know whether to strangle her or tap my foot.  She's got a good voice.  Yeah, she's not being weird.  She loves holding notes.  Yeah.  Oh, she does.  She did the same thing in the Kesha song.  Those notes are not held in the songs, but she loves to hold on to those notes. 
[00:28:00]  She doesn't want to let those notes go.  But it's fun to listen to.  No, no, no.  No, no, no.  Try to make me go to rehab.  No, no, no.  She says British.  No, no, no.  You want a regular karaoke version of it from Patty?  From Patty.  Let her know the song a little bit.  Yeah, man.  That's hard.  You know, the tempo of the song.  Do it next week.  All right.  Yeah.  You want to go to a break with someone set?  I think so.  Yeah.  People are asking because they weren't able to listen yesterday if we're going to replay 
[00:28:30]  this thing.  We should have maybe replayed it over the weekend.  Yeah, we'll play it.  Is there a slot somewhere?  Yeah, we'll probably play.  It'll probably take up most of the worst of the week countdown.  Oh, that's fair enough.  Well, yeah.  Because I'm sure there were dead spots in there.  So if you clean it up and just give the highlights, that's good enough for the people.  We're just going to do like everybody's sets.  All right.  So.  That's the bombing, right?  No, no, no.  We're going to highlight.  We're going to replay the bombings.  Oh, man.  I kind of want to take the staff to lunch.  I've been saying, like, I want to take all the guys who went on to lunch. 
[00:29:00]  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Fair enough.  But it's raining.  But it's raining.  Leave two of them behind.  You don't let me finish.  But it's raining.  Everybody on the staff is just like, lunch?  I remember we went to lunch in like 2008.  All right.  We'll do the right thing.  Let's see.  Let's see.  One, two, three burgers and 80 tons of krill.  Oh, sorry.  It still works.  Who do we play to break? 
[00:29:30]  It still works.  Well, do you want to play one of the really good ones or one of the?  Don't suggest Bobo.  Bobo, I mean, Bobo was painful.  You think so?  Travis and I thought that the audience wasn't fair to Bobo.  Hey, we're making sounds like you.  What the fuck is he talking about?  Wait, who said what?  Travis and I thought the audience wasn't fair to Bobo.  Oh, God, don't do that.  We thought his material was stronger than the audience.  Ah, they went into it with a little bit of prejudice. 
[00:30:00]  Why are we doing this?  It's a small dick after all joke?  That's fucking Bobo.  I actually wrote Bobo's, it's a small dick after all joke months ago, and he gets it  wrong every time.  Oh, yeah.  Every time.  Every time he does it wrong.  He fucked it up so bad.  Did you know he'd get it wrong?  Of course.  It's our favorite thing to watch him go up and perform it incorrectly.  It's a small dick.  What was he saying?  It's a small...  It's a...  He sings it's a small dick after all, but he was supposed to say, you know, I went to 
[00:30:30]  Disneyland and I met the girl in the Minnie Mouse costume.  Right.  Yeah.  A little set up that makes sense to the song.  I was in a bar.  Anything you blow job, it's a small dick after it is.  It's a small dick.  I think it's a small dick.  Disaster.  He enrages me.  Oh, just annoying.  Just goes up and thank you.  It's fucking blathers.  It's just unconnected blathering.  There's no punchlines at all. 
[00:31:00]  There's no connection.  No.  Nothing.  It's like watching fucking radio waves fly over your head.  You know what it is?  That's what it's like when you watch him.  It's like...  Or smoke.  You look...  There's no interaction with it.  There's no connection to it.  I don't even understand why he's a fan of the show.  If you have no concept of what's going on, how do you become a fan of something?  Jimmy's reaction was great.  He's like, what are you doing?  You're just sitting there.  Words, words, words.  Words, words, words.  That was driving me nuts.  I think Ann had the best Bobo line ever.  Yesterday.  What did he say? 
[00:31:30]  I don't want to blow it.  Oh, is it on the thing?  Okay.  You should thank the flat tire on the way to the abortion.  Yeah.  That's one for the ages right there.  Ugh.  Bobo.  Yeah, or the flat tire on the way to the hospital.  So why don't we play the Bobo set?  Oh, boy.  And we'll talk more about the live broadcast.  We'll play highlights all morning, I guess?  Yeah.  All right.  We could do that.  And pick lunch for the guys.  Where should we have lunch with the guys?  Oh, wow.  Oh, we have a nice breakfast spot we like to go to. 
[00:32:00]  Do we?  Oh, yeah.  Wow.  It's a really nice place.  Is it the place we used to go to with Bob?  Oh, with the guy with the fucking potato salad hat?  Oh, not that place.  Oh, that guy with the fucking walk hairdo?  Sir, can I stir some vegetables in your hair?  What is that on your fucking head?  You're not fooling anybody.  Hi, how are you?  I don't know.  Fucking ghoul.  How are you?  Fucking riffraff in a Gene Simmons wig.  How are you?  I'm fine.  He's the worst with that wig.  He's a huge fan, too. 
[00:32:30]  Oh, well.  He's the best.  Nicest guy, but...  He just is hard to look at.  Yeah, I'd love to eat there with the guys.  I'm a little pricey, though.  Mm-hmm.  And it's raining.  And it's raining.  And it's Friday.  I'll take the guys there in the rain for Friday.  No, we'll figure it out.  All right, Bobo in the break?  Yeah.  From yesterday's broadcast.  I think Bobo wants to do three minutes.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, I forgot about Bobo.  Holy shit.  What a treat this is.  All right, cool.  I do not think you're top Iraqers now.  Damn.  Oh, he can. 
[00:33:00]  That's it.  Eager to get to the stage.  Bobo.  Hello, Daniel.  Hey, good evening, Orn Rock!  Good evening.  What the fuck is that?  Just say hi to Orn Rock.  We're here at the Orn Rock Cafe.  The Orn Rock Cafe.  Hi to Orn Rock.  Bobo, stop it.  Wait, wait, wait.  The intro, Bobo.  We need an intro.  Bobo, wait.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Jesus Christ.  You're panicking.  Look at him.  He's freaking out.  You're panicking.  He's pulling up his pants. 
[00:33:30]  Exactly.  Put some socks on.  I'm good with you.  Look at him freaking out like he's not going to fly Qantas.  Believe it or not, but believe it, we got an extra spot.  Bobo!  What happened?  We hear the mic.  Believe it or not, but believe it, we got an extra special guest.  Who is this mystery guest?  And what I mean by special, here's Bobo.  Bobo!  Bobo! 
[00:34:00]  Good day, Orn Rock!  Orn Rock.  I had this crazy encounter at the supermarket recently.  I don't know.  I saw these two people that were mentally impaired.  Mostly all they do is just pack the bags.  They just load the bags.  But these people were speaking in some, I don't know, some noise or something.  And I know these guys weren't deaf.  All right?  They can hear it perfectly because I freaking tell them to pack my bags.  And they do that. 
[00:34:30]  But I've always noticed these making some noise.  I don't know what they were doing.  But they clearly freaking understand what they were saying.  They were going...  And I said, what the fuck are you saying?  Any people freaking understand what they're saying?  Bobo, they're still your parents, dude.  Come on.  Put me some new language.  I should just start speaking.  Bobo!  I should just start speaking to everybody like that.  These guys at the supermarket are going... 
[00:35:00]  I want the fucking guys, all right?  I don't go to your job.  I don't go to every one of your jobs.  It heckles you.  Bobo, you're doing awesome, dude.  I need to heckle it, right?  Work through it.  Work through it, Bobo.  Bobo, you got to connect with the audience, Bobo.  Go ahead.  You talk while I talk.  And you freaking people from Philly.  Philly sucks.  You guys from Philly, you're going to collapse.  And we're going to make the playoffs. 
[00:35:30]  It's going to be a reverse of 07-08.  And you guys are freaking all your freaking teams in your city.  You're going to suck this year.  What happened?  Your Phillies suck.  Your Phillies suck.  Your Eagles suck.  Your Flyers suck.  And the 36ers suck.  He's doing great.  Yeah, he sure is.  Get back to your material, Bobo.  Let's go.  Come on, Bobo.  Get to the material.  Back to the material.  Do another bed.  Another joke. 
[00:36:00]  Not being professional.  Or do some crowd work.  Something.  Another joke.  I'll tell you a little bit about this time.  I almost got my dick sucked at a bar.  There you go.  There you go.  Now you're talking.  All right.  Yeah, and a bar.  The bar I go to, right.  Swimming off for a New Year's party.  All of a sudden, she freaking comes out of the bathroom, freaking laughing, saying,  It's a tiny dick at all.  It's a tiny dick, all right.  It's a tiny dick, all right. 
[00:36:30]  It's a small, small dick.  Oh, God.  People start laughing at all the whole bar.  The whole bar.  I get freaking people laughing.  And I all of a sudden see freaking people with the slide whistles all of a sudden doing what Ant does.  We're going to hold balls.  We're going to ruin New Year's.  What, preparing to shoot you in the back of the head?  You're not.  Bobo, you're not.  Bobo, Bobo, you're not connecting.  What you've got to do to connect with the audience is you're just coming out and you're yelling words eagerly. 
[00:37:00]  You have to connect a little bit.  You can't be so wrapped up in your head that you're just not interacting at all.  You slow down, relax, talk in a normal voice.  You just ran out.  Words, words, words, words, words, words, words, words.  You have to pause a little bit, brother.  Yeah, take your time.  You can say hello to the audience.  You know, you're walking in front of a room full of people.  Say hi.  How are you?  Awesome.  How are you guys?  We can make a long trip.  I saw the whole line. 
[00:37:30]  This is more people than there was a few years ago.  This place looked like it was so empty than a day when the Mets weren't winning.  That's what this place looked like in 08.  Halloween 08.  It was so empty.  I thought, was I here or was I at City Field in September?  Holy shit.  I said City Field in September.  This is brutal.  This is brutal.  Holy shit.  How the hell was the Mets game?  Oh, the hot chick wants to ask the question. 
[00:38:00]  What did she say?  No, I annoyed my whole sister the whole game.  I freaking called her Obie because Obie was supposed to be at that game.  Oh, that's right.  I was so bummed.  I was so bummed out about it.  I called Shannon Obie the whole game.  She freaking got annoyed the whole time when she arrived at the game.  I made her even say to me, how are you doing there, brother man, brother man?  What?  I ripped my ticket.  What?  Yeah, you ripped the ticket.  That's why I couldn't go.  You did.  Remember, you ripped the ticket. 
[00:38:30]  That ticket worked.  I gave my sister.  It's not a good delivery.  I invited you, Anthony.  Didn't you see me invite on Twitter?  Yeah, I was.  I invited you, Ant.  I'd have gone with your sister.  Yeah.  These stories are fascinating.  I invited you to the game.  Tards are easy to fuck.  Two more years, Ant.  Two more years.  And then she's too old for me.  What do you mean, and then she's been too old for you for eight years? 
[00:39:00]  Oh, Jimmy.  You didn't invite him.  Well, Jimmy was also invited.  Uh, Bobo, you're done.  Yeah, Bobo, thank you.  Nice hand from Bobo.  Bobo, you're done.  Bobo, you're done.  Bobo, oh my God.  What a great job.  Bobo, just noise.  Holy shit.  Fucking noise.  Wow.  This is the Virus Sirius XM.  And now, the Obi and Anthony show.  Hi, good morning. 
[00:39:30]  Hopi and Anthony, Jim Norton, everybody else.  Blah, blah, blah.  Hi.  During the break, we were talking about Utah.  And Obi goes, so you're going to be there the 19th and 20th of August?  I'm like, yes.  What?  Oh, no.  What happened?  Utah.  Remember you were asking about Utah?  Like, why am I doing wise guys?  Why do you say it that way?  What?  Say it again.  You said to me like you're doing Utah.  Oh, now you're saying it kind of wrong.  How am I supposed to?  Was I saying it wrong?  Utah?  Were you saying Utah?  Oh, Utah.  Maybe.  I don't know.  Utah.  Utah. 
[00:40:00]  Where all the Mormons are.  Because I'll be there the 19th, 20th of Wise Guys.  And it's actually selling well.  Turn it off.  Yeah, if you think you might want to be with a man, turn it off.  It's still my favorite.  We have some.  We have those guys next week.  I think we have four guys from the Book of Mormon, which.  Are they going to sing?  I don't know.  Maybe they can sing something else because they have good voices.  They're fucking.  They're trained.  What?  We're going to do Beatles songs.  Beatles songs.  Oh, that would be great.  Or that Andrew, whatever his name is, the lead, the guy who plays Price is coming. 
[00:40:30]  We have some fucking.  They're really good.  You got to see it.  I'm telling you.  I never recommend live shows like that.  You and your gals should go see it.  I'm waiting for my apartment to get all nice and done.  That's getting done today, by the way.  It's the best date fucking play, especially for your humor.  Yeah.  You'd love it.  It's real edgy, man.  Oh, it's fucking great.  Very good.  Lots going on.  Well, I got a letter that I want to read to you.  Me!  Don't look at this.  Sell the letter. 
[00:41:00]  All right.  This was a shock today.  A letter?  An actual paper letter?  And also, I want to thank someone who tweeted this to me yesterday, basically saying the  Pickers guys are absolutely gay, because their latest commercial.  Was it you?  No, no, no, no.  Oh, okay.  Their latest commercial for their new season?  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Really?  They're barely hiding it at this point.  You want to do that real fast?  They're barely hiding it.  It's on YouTube, I think.  Pickers commercial.  They're doing a little remake of a little Broadway number. 
[00:41:30]  Oh, wow.  To promote Pickers.  Wow.  Yeah.  We were very suspicious of these guys when they came in.  I mean, we don't give a fuck in the end, but very suspicious that they may be together  or something.  I'm a good picker, don't you see?  Because it's the perfect job for me.  Original fun, you know.  We're meeting Pickers everywhere we go. 
[00:42:00]  There's no Pickers, no Pickers.  It's like the old Dr. Pepper.  Would you like to be a Picker, too?  Us Pickers are an interesting breed.  We'll drive across the country on a lead.  Ask any Picker, and they'll say.  Yes, the both of us are gay.  Turn it off.  Pushy Pickers, Pushy Pickers.  Highway Pickers are selling Pickers.  Wouldn't you like to be a Picker, too?  Be a pusher.  Be a stool pusher. 
[00:42:30]  Wouldn't you like to be a Picker, too?  Be a Picker.  Watch American Pickers.  This is ripe for fucking bleeping.  It is.  That's ripe for a good bleep.  I don't know how to do that.  Freaky Jervais laugh at the end.  Oh, wow.  Was that...  They just don't want to tell the world they're gay, I guess?  Well, I think...  They're scared it would hurt their audience?  Has it been confirmed?  I mean, they struck me as gay.  Oh, boy, do they.  It's just...  Especially the one guy when he was talking about chicks.  Remember? 
[00:43:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Chicks.  Yeah.  It didn't really...  We like those guys.  What the fuck are we doing?  But I don't think that's insulting.  They struck me as gay.  I don't care.  I wouldn't dislike their show.  I'm sure they've heard it before.  Hey.  I'm sure they've heard it in much more brutal terms on Twitter and whatnot.  Did we ask them or no?  Hell no.  I think we implied something a couple of times.  I don't know if you're just allowed to...  Why not?  I mean, I guess you're allowed to, but it's just still a weird thing to just openly ask  someone, I guess.  Are you guys a couple? 
[00:43:30]  Like, as you said...  Yeah.  Especially when...  But look, if someone said to you guys, as an even seriously, hey, Opie and Anthony,  are you a couple?  It's like, honestly, no.  No, no.  No.  You don't come off like that?  You don't interact like that?  No, no.  You would say, none of your fucking business.  None of your business.  How'd they come up with the name Pickers?  Well, the string fell off the gerbil's tail.  See?  He had to get in there and pick.  Oh!  I wasn't sure.  See, you had to pick it out.  I didn't know.  I heard gerbil.  I just was taken back in time. 
[00:44:00]  Exactly.  Eric's got something.  What's up?  Last time they were here, they were recording a bunch of IDs, and they joked about liking  cock in one of the IDs, if you want to hear that.  Oh, really?  Yeah, let's hear that.  Of course we do.  Hey, this is Frank.  And Mike Wolfe.  And you're listening to the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  I love black cock.  Woo-hoo!  Is that something you just blurt out?  To be fair, there's a sign in Derek's studio that says, I heart black cock. 
[00:44:30]  Oh, that is true.  I do remember that, yes.  However, they're the only people that have decided to comment.  To acknowledge it.  They were the only ones that acknowledged it.  Okay.  Yeah, right.  Yeah, most people wouldn't even say anything.  No, or say that's a weird sign and not read it out loud.  All right, here's a letter that came into the show.  We rarely get letters.  It's official, too.  Hi, guys.  My daughter, Caitlin, I regret to say, gets a kick out of you guys. 
[00:45:00]  We're playing a little game, so focus.  Uh-huh.  This person regrets to say that his daughter, Caitlin, gets a kick out of us.  She's a Hofstra graduate who majored in music and business and has interned in a number of music companies.  In any event, I am sending her resume to you so that perhaps you might forward it to the right person at Sirius.  It's the least you can do after I, and I'll stop right there because it'll give it away for now. 
[00:45:30]  Who is this letter from?  There's some really good hints in here.  Okay, can you read it again?  My daughter, Caitlin, I regret to say, gets a kick out of you guys.  This guy is not happy that his daughter likes this fucking show.  Yeah.  And then, you know, trying to get her a job here.  Wants us to pass the resume along to somebody.  And it's the least you can do after I, and this person did something to us.  Howard Stern? 
[00:46:00]  After I, is this person...  Ken Stevens.  That was a bad guess, though.  That was good.  Is this...  Wait a minute.  The last line will give it away.  Gary Wall?  Wow.  No.  Good guess, though.  Oh, this is fun.  After I...  It's not going to be good, obviously.  After I, blank. 
[00:46:30]  Sued us?  No.  Got us fired?  Maybe.  After I went to jail, I got arrested for you?  No.  Um...  It's warmer.  Yeah?  It's warmer than Jimmy.  Got us in trouble in some way.  Dave Douglas' daughter.  You're right around it.  Put up with your shit? 
[00:47:00]  No.  No.  This person doesn't put up with our shit.  After I wore a wig and went to Thailand?  Uh...  Uh...  Uh...  It's really close.  Shit.  Really close.  Is it a writer?  No.  Is it on anyone of any public note?  Do you know him publicly?  Yeah, there's...  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  People know this...  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[00:47:30]  People know this person.  Yeah, there's the only reason we're doing it.  If it was inside, like, Ken Stevens or Gary Wall, I guess that would be interest to some people,  but not the masses, like this one would be.  After I...  Fuck you both in the butt?  Oh, shit!  God damn it, people got it on the phone lines.  I'm not looking.  They're just guessing.  You're really...  And they got it on feedback.  I'm really not looking.  Was this person ever on our show?  Oh, yeah.  Oh! 
[00:48:00]  You're really close.  Jim Cook.  That's a really good guess, but no.  Oh, no.  Um, Steve, St. Patrick's Cathedral.  Wow, am I bombing today?  I was actually, right before you said that, I was going to say Steve the Whistler.  Jimmy's close. 
[00:48:30]  That's the security guard.  No.  That what?  That was the security guard that ratted out at St. Pat's.  No.  It has something to do with St. Pat's.  Yes.  Oh, yes, it does.  Paul Mercurio.  Everyone's got it, Ant.  You're tired today.  You were right there.  Maybe I should answer one of your questions better, so I might have torn you off a little bit.  After I... 
[00:49:00]  Is it a news person?  No.  No.  I guess the woman who got arrested, but it's not her.  No, no, no.  Um, it's not her boyfriend, because he's dead.  He's dead.  It's not Mercurio.  Mm-mm.  Daughter is in college, so it's college-age daughter.  Right.  A graduate.  Graduate.  So she's 22, 23.  All right, so we've got to look back at how many years ago that was.  This kid at the time.  Oh, my God, you were right there, Ant. 
[00:49:30]  I know, but it's hard when you're...  Everyone has it.  When you're right there and don't know.  Everyone has it.  I'm not looking.  Yes, it has something to do with St. Pat's.  And it's somebody that was on our show.  Absolutely.  Has been on our show.  Numerous times?  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  A member of the show?  No.  A guest of the show.  Numerous times.  They all have it.  Doesn't like us?  They're frustrated now.  Doesn't like us?  Likes us. 
[00:50:00]  Likes us.  That might be confusing, though.  And now it's a list way down.  That is really confusing.  That might confuse the whole issue, though.  But yes, likes us.  Likes us.  On television?  Was he on television?  Yeah.  Yes.  Right?  Oh, you were ahead of time.  Damn it.  Bill Tetley?  You're just making a circle around the answer now.  I know, but that's just that.  I know, but that's just that.  It's very, it's very difficult.  You got all the parts. 
[00:50:30]  Just name it.  It's very difficult.  Name this person.  You don't understand.  You know, so you could look at this in hindsight.  But these guys didn't know going into it?  Ah, they probably fucking cheated.  How did they cheat?  Researched something.  Put the parts together.  Involved with St. Pat's in some way, shape, or form.  Yes.  Is it, uh, no, it wouldn't be.  Oh, my God.  In all fairness.  Bill Donahue? 
[00:51:00]  Oh, my God.  Give yourself a bell.  I wouldn't even, I wasn't even going to think that.  Give yourself a bell.  That's funny.  Wow.  We got a letter from Bill Donahue.  For the people, because we do have newer listeners,  he was instrumental in getting us fired for the Sex for Sam thing.  Yeah.  I mean, if he didn't grandstand and make every TV show on a slow news week,  maybe, I'm just saying maybe, we would have had a chance of skating.  Maybe.  But, man, he wasn't going to let this issue go anytime soon. 
[00:51:30]  Since then, we've had him on the show.  I have a love-hate for the guy myself.  But he's done a lot of radio with us in the last seven years.  And we got him, by the way, to some people know,  when we first came back on, he had done something public.  And we were like, fuck him, let's get him on.  Let's get him on and brutalize him.  And then he came on the show, and we found him to be likable.  And then I wound up really hating the attorneys and the company that fired us  as opposed to the guy who didn't get us fired. 
[00:52:00]  Donahue did the right thing in the end.  I'll say that much.  Because when we were coming back, he wished us nothing but the best.  And I know XM at the time was really scared if the Catholic was going to go after us again.  And Bill Donahue was like, no, man, that's done, and I wish him nothing but the best.  So it helped on K-Rock, too.  Yeah, absolutely.  So once again, he writes, hi, guys.  My daughter, Caitlin, I regret to say, gets a kick out of you guys.  She's a Hofstra graduate who has majored in music and business  and has interned in a number of music companies. 
[00:52:30]  In any event, I am sending her resume to you  so that perhaps you might forward it to the right person at Sirius.  And then this is the final line that I didn't really give you.  It's the least you could do after I sandbagged your job a few years ago.  Sincerely, William Donahue, president of the Catholic League.  Oh, there you go.  This fucking asshole wants us to get his daughter a job?  Go screw.  Well, you could pass along the information.  She's innocent in this whole thing.  Yeah, sure can. 
[00:53:00]  Oh.  She's doing a favor to her more than him.  Yeah.  She's just trying to make her way in life.  Did you enjoy your two years, three months off?  Paid?  Fuck yeah.  As long as looking at how it worked out,  how we were able to come back and get a job after that and everything.  Yeah, good point.  It kind of, you know, it all worked out in the end.  Sure.  I guess Jesus was looking after us.  Jesus.  And by the way, if the lawyers had not been such cowards,  we never would have been fired. 
[00:53:30]  The show never would have been fired  because Donahue was not on the board  and he's not an attorney.  Shouldn't have been.  Any more than Jack Hafferty,  when the CNN happened,  when he said something about the goons  and being all thugs in China,  the government,  and the Asians were protesting  and CNN didn't buckle like fucking pussies and fire them.  Didn't do anything.  Nothing happened.  Yeah.  Nothing happened.  It just goes away.  Who was one recently, too, that they didn't fire?  Somebody said something,  like Tracy had to apologize, he got in trouble.  Who got in trouble recently, but just nothing happened?  Oh, fuck. 
[00:54:00]  I don't know now.  What's Joe Coy, was it?  No, Joe Coy said he was...  Oh, someone bigger, right?  Someone that could be fired and it wasn't.  A news person.  It was a news person or somebody on TV that did something  and they didn't, nothing happened.  They just sort of wrote it out and he was fine in the end.  Of course.  I don't know who it was.  We should get his daughter a job here.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  We should.  Oh, don't say that.  Oh, boy.  What?  What happened?  The way you said it.  Oh, yeah, we should.  Is that the, what you call the ultimate vengeance? 
[00:54:30]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, come on.  Oh, yeah, it is.  She's probably listening right now.  Hi.  All right, listen.  Hi, Caitlin.  The real Jim Norton at gmail.com.  If you really want to get even with dad,  bring me home.  Oh, yeah.  Let's see your resume.  Your resume may be good.  It's like, you know, maybe we just pass it along.  And you know what?  Catholic girls?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Catholic girls.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah? 
[00:55:00]  Right there?  Oh, and the other.  There, too?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  And this.  And then that one?  Oh, my God.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, I must say.  One after the other?  Oh, well, usually you go.  There.  And then in there.  There's a whole family of very staunch Catholic girls that I knew growing up,  and they were the goers, every one of them.  Every single one of them.  A one was not a goer.  Wow.  And, boy, the parents were just strict Catholics. 
[00:55:30]  Used to look at the Catholic Digest for movies to see if the movie was rated by the Catholic Digest,  and if some of the movies were condemned.  Like I said, movie condemned.  Those were the ones you had to see.  Yeah.  Well, we would say we were going to one movie, and we'd go to the other.  Of course.  And things like that.  And then we wouldn't go to the movie at all.  We'd go to some park and have sexual intercourse.  Oh.  Which one?  Out of wedlock. 
[00:56:00]  This one or this one?  Actually, mostly that one.  This one?  That one.  Sometimes.  This one?  Wow.  Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Oh, you're talking.  No, no, okay.  That's what you see.  I thought you were going like full length person.  No.  And this is like that.  No.  Oh, if you want that, then I have to flip this over, and then.  Yeah.  No, I'm talking.  I'm talking basic.  Yeah.  This is.  We're talking.  In that one.  No, that's not basic.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  She's on her belly.  This. 
[00:56:30]  It's on her belly.  This is above that.  Yeah, but that's bigger than that.  Right.  Oh, that's gross.  See?  You're looking at a big ass.  Who are you hanging out with?  Is this an asshole right here?  No.  I sit on her.  That's up here.  We were being subtle before.  I sit on her belly.  Okay, then this mostly.  Yeah, okay.  I have the list of the condemned films.  A mere half hour ago, I was wondering why our audience hasn't grown with us.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I just answered my own question. 
[00:57:00]  The fact that you have your finger in the okay and you're putting the other finger into  it like I would do when I was eight.  Yes.  These are the films that were condemned by the Catholic organization.  Oh, and that is around the time frame where I would be going to the movies.  When did it end?  In 1980 is the last year.  Oh, wow.  I did want to see, I believe, Dawn of the Dead.  It's on there.  Back in 78.  But do you go to hell if you saw one of these movies?  Well, it's condemned.  Grease.  Grease.  Well, a lot of sex. 
[00:57:30]  Well, Grease 2 should have been condemned.  Used cars in 1980 was condemned, yes.  That's too fucking high.  Do you know how starstruck I was when I met the lead from used cars, that guy who played  Jeff?  Right.  Bro, this is a red fucking car, Rudy.  You know, he just said fuck.  That's an FCC violation.  Remember when the fucking hood shoots up and it catches the girl's dress and her fucking  dresses quite, and then Squiggy from Lenny and Squiggy is like, oh, Jesus, she's caught 
[00:58:00]  on the hood ornament.  Oh, don't you hate women?  That's my favorite line.  Oh, don't you hate women?  Nice.  It's such a threat.  Yeah, Lenny said that she's caught on the hood ornament.  Don't you hate women?  Fuck, I love that line.  Their big tits pop out.  Of course.  On TV.  That was the time.  Hey, look, a pair of tits.  I fucking love that.  That was the time.  And tits were always popping out in the movies.  What the fuck is it?  Outlaw Josie Wales?  Oh, yeah. 
[00:58:30]  She had the rape scene.  Oh, wow.  They raped and killed his wife.  That's true.  Original Friday the 13th, Condemned.  Condemned, yes.  Devil boy.  By the way, the original Friday the 13th, Condemned, I went with one of the girls from  that family and spent the whole time with our hands down each other's pants.  Well, there you go.  Watching Friday the 13th.  Really?  What the hell?  Yeah, watching a Condemned movie as we fucking mutually masturbated each other in the back  row of the theater.  How'd you keep a rod through that? 
[00:59:00]  Jesus, you're a better man than me.  You kept a rod through the fucking Mrs. Voorhees killing everybody with her fucking lesbian  haircut?  And that fucking bad sweater?  I love that fucking sweater she wore.  Kill them, honey.  Kill them.  Anthony's pumping a load over her knuckles.  Blurka, blurka, blurka, blurka.  As Jason's popping out of the water.  That's what your cock was doing.  You're a fucking slow lava cum.  Hot 13-year-old boy cum.  Back then, forget about it.  Fucking hitting the back of the people in the front row. 
[00:59:30]  What other movies were it condemned?  Carrie.  Carrie.  The Omen.  All That Jazz.  All That Jazz.  Why?  Is that because it's a gay flick?  Maybe it's about Bob Fosse, right?  Oh, was there some gay in that?  Rocky Horror Picture Show.  Oh, yeah, tranny.  High Plains Drifter.  They really did not like.  Of course, Clockwork.  Those Westerners.  Clockwork Orange.  Rape.  Well, yeah.  Sure. 
[01:00:00]  Rosemary's Baby.  The Good, The Bad, The Ugly.  The Odd Couple.  The Odd Couple.  Well, two men living together.  You know what that's about?  Yeah.  Turn it off.  Turn it off.  I'm curious.  Yellow.  A fistful of dollars.  Man.  What the fuck?  Didn't like the Westerns.  Or violence.  Maybe they just didn't like Sergio Leone and the Spaghetti Westerns.  Yeah.  The violence they probably felt was too much.  Psycho.  Spartacus.  All right.  Or they hated Clint Eastwood for some reason.  Yeah.  Some like it hot.  Spartacus was very homoerotic. 
[01:00:30]  Oh, Spartacus.  Yeah.  Well, we had to consult that before we went to the movies.  To see what you were going to see?  But every one of them was a goer.  All my friends would hook up with the other ones.  My older friends would hook up with the older daughters.  The younger daughters would hook up with me.  All in one house?  Sometimes, yeah.  Wow.  Sometimes we'd all go down into the basement to play ping pong. 
[01:01:00]  And everybody would just pick a corner and just start making out.  It's like a little making out.  A little orgy for teenagers.  Yeah.  Yeah, it was.  It was.  And then you'd hear the door open up upstairs and the father would yell down, what's going  on down there?  Because he wouldn't hear the ping pong ball going.  Yeah.  So he would yell, what's going on down there?  Oh, we're just, you know, we're talking.  All right.  Wow.  I want to know what's going on.  All right.  Why didn't you go downstairs?  They would never.  The lazy fuck? 
[01:01:30]  They would never just pop in and try to catch.  I think they were afraid of what they were going to see, to tell you the truth.  And you should have one guy playing ping pong.  You know how you can put one side of the ping pong table up?  You didn't want asshole fucking guy friend that wasn't getting any down there to fucking  cock block.  But at least he's got the ping pong fucking noise happening for the father upstairs.  They were going to sleep anyway.  They went to sleep pretty early.  They were going on right under their noses.  Yeah.  And then they had a fucking cabin upstate. 
[01:02:00]  And we used to all go up there, all paired off, guys and girls, and just debaucherous drinking  and sex was great back then.  Then we found the father's, the Achiever letters.  Oh boy, did that start a thing.  Did what?  Burnt the cabin down with the cigars.  Oh, really?  No, it's a Seinfeld episode.  Oh.  I got distracted by this whale of a tail.  They freed a humpback and the damn thing did a dance of joy. 
[01:02:30]  Is it doing a dance really or is it just flopping in the water?  Yeah, it's a dumb whale.  Look at it.  He's just very happy that he was freed and he's showing his appreciation for the humans.  He's breaching.  Sure.  It's called breaching.  Is that what a whale does when he's happy?  They all, they frolic?  I don't know.  They frolic.  I don't speak whale.  They did in the Star Trek.  I was waiting for it.  What they should have done, they should have fucking taken him out of the water and dropped  him off in a wheat field.  And they said, now who's a tough guy? 
[01:03:00]  Now who's Mr. Big Shot?  Wheat field.  Try jumping now, dummy.  Yeah, why don't you frolic in the sunflowers and the punks?  You're such a city guy, man.  Why don't you frolic around here with all the bumblebees stinging your fat blubber?  What do you think of that?  Your fucking delicious whale skin bakes.  Then I'll drink water right in front of them and go, I don't even want this.  I'll dump it out.  Give him a kick in his big dumb jaw. 
[01:03:30]  That's my goal, actually, is to fucking hook up my fucking truck and drag a whale out of  the water into a wheat field.  Just kick him around for a little while.  The oddest thing about whales and porpoise are their eyes, they're in the water, so you  assume fish instantly, even though you know it's a mammal.  But their eyes are very fucking mammal-like.  Like a dog.  You know how dogs are expressive and you know that they're pissed or they're sad or something 
[01:04:00]  like that?  You look at a dolphin's eyes or something like that?  It's so weird.  They're like, wow, there's something going on in there.  Very human-like.  There's something going on behind those fucking peepers.  Oh, Jesus.  Where's that, Japan?  Yeah, yeah.  Fucking shit country.  There's a giant whale on the back of a semi-flatbed being pulled through the streets with just  blood all over the fucking place.  That country makes me sick, the way they treat whales.  They're just terrible.  They can't even transport them properly after they fucking kill the thing? 
[01:04:30]  Awful.  Big tails just dragging on the ground.  And no one's even horrified.  They're just used to seeing that shit.  Now they walk by just thinking, eh, well.  We're fucking doomed.  The fuck are we killing everything?  I would just slap it.  I wouldn't kill it.  I'm not even an animal guy, but what the fuck?  How many whales do you need?  A lot of meat.  Yeah, it's true.  I wouldn't even make meat out of them, though.  I wouldn't even make...  No.  I would just make whale sandwiches and give them out.  If you didn't want it, throw it out.  Here's a whale sandwich on rye. 
[01:05:00]  I don't want that.  I'd throw it out.  That would suck, a whale sandwich.  Yeah.  Fatty.  Just a big...  Gristle.  It's a seven-inch thick piece of blubber between two pieces of wheat bread.  Oh, God.  Would that be horrible?  With low-fat mayo and a glass of milk.  Here's your whale sandwich, shit face.  Is he right?  His mouth's watering.  No, it's not.  His back is itching because he's afraid they're going to cut it.  Sorry.  See, you went the other way like he was the whale.  He had a good joke that he said in my ear.  What?  Oh, he said if he ate a whale sandwich, it would be cannibalism. 
[01:05:30]  Oh, see?  Yeah.  I love the self-deprecation.  Or could-a-bolism.  What?  Instead of cannibalism.  It's horrible.  Yes, because he's jealous.  They use a lot of the whale things in China and Japan, I mean, for these weird rituals  and these ancient fucking bullshit disproven things.  Oh, the fin.  They'd throw the whole whale away and keep like one square inch of one of his fins and sell 
[01:06:00]  it for a million dollars because it gives you boners.  I was going to say, yeah, it makes your penis as hard.  But, of course, yeah, well, listen, you heard about, what's his name there?  The Yankee guy, right?  Hideki Arabu?  Hideki Arabu.  Oh, boy.  He was the one that George Steinbrenner called, what, a big pussy toad or a big fat pussy toad  or something?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, that must have stuck with him.  For a long time.  Yeah.  He didn't do well.  He hung himself in L.A. 
[01:06:30]  Yeah.  He didn't do well at all.  He came in, and they would talk about him as the Japanese Nolan Ryan.  He went through, I think, the...  Nolan Ryan?  Yeah, yeah, Nolan Ryan.  No one knew who that was.  And he went through that.  I guess he pitched in a little bit of, like, double A or triple A ball just to warm up.  And then he came up against the...  I'm from memory.  I remember the Detroit Tigers.  I could be wrong.  It was his game.  And he struck out, I think, the first six, which I just read.  Oh.  And he won that game.  He was very good. 
[01:07:00]  And I think the next game he won, but he wasn't as good.  And he just never...  His...  They said his best moment was that fucking first Yankee game.  That was it.  Yeah, I think he went to the Dodgers after that.  He was all over the place.  How did I look this up instead of guessing?  No, I think he only won 29 games for the Yankees.  I think I read that today.  Padres?  Is that about right?  34 and 35, I think his record was.  With the Yankees?  Yes.  Okay.  I always thought it was more than that, but, yeah, he wasn't around that much.  No, he was there for three years.  I can't believe it's 97 they brought him out, dude. 
[01:07:30]  And he was done by 2000, at least.  Yankee signed him for a 12.8 million, four-year deal.  Hold on, I'll look for his record here.  But it really wasn't good.  It was a little below...  97 through 99.  That was it for him.  God.  Winning two World Series rings, of course, because it's the Yankees.  But he wasn't even a starter.  Despite only pitching in one post-season game and having no post-season decisions, oh, boy. 
[01:08:00]  He was a bust.  Oh, boy.  I feel bad for him.  I don't know why this story makes me a little sad.  He was only 42.  Yeah.  Hung himself in L.A. yesterday.  Who found him?  I don't know.  It's always the worst thing, I think, when someone hangs themselves.  It's like, who's got to walk in and look at that nightmarish, purple fucking bloated head.  And you're just fucking, the feet hanging.  There's something about somebody not being on the ground that is creepy.  Yeah.  Whether they're just hovering ghost-like in the air or hanging by the neck. 
[01:08:30]  If any of my family members are going to kill themselves, fucking just jump off a cliff,  please.  Yeah?  Into some water.  With a no.  Maybe a video proving that you jumped so we know you're really gone.  Pull out a floater out of the water.  Yeah, but I don't want to have to go in one of my siblings' apartments one day.  I have to find it.  Or houses and find you hanging.  Don't do that to us.  That's true.  If there's a floater, somebody reports it without really looking at it.  Right.  And then the pros got to come in.  Well, preferably.  The guys that signed up for that shit. 
[01:09:00]  Preferably in shark-infested waters would be nice.  Oh, totally eaten, totally gone.  Yes, yes.  Jump off a cliff into shark-infested waters.  Make it easy for the rest of the family that is left behind.  Speaking of which, we have an Olympic skier who also killed himself.  And this guy won a silver medal at the last Winter Olympics.  That's probably why he killed himself.  There's a gold in front of it.  He missed the gold.  And by how much?  Was it .00001 second?  Oh, oh, oh. 
[01:09:30]  Oh, oh, oh.  I don't know.  If anyone knows anything about skier Jarrett Peterson, please give the show a call.  Speedy Peterson, they'd call him.  Speedy Peterson.  And it wasn't for skiing.  Oh, maybe that was a problem.  That was why.  Really?  Oh, boy.  Yep.  Well, he called 911 before he offed himself.  911.  This guy wasn't playing.  He called 911 and said a few things, and that was it.  Yeah.  What did he say?  This is really creepy. 
[01:10:00]  You want to hear it?  Yeah.  Yeah.  This is really creepy.  How do you do it?  How did he off himself?  I don't know.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  That's the real deal.  Well, not like hanging, is it?  Which is worse, you think?  I think hanging would be worse.  Way worse.  No.  Gunshot's worse.  Because if you're hanging to me, I don't know if it's more painful, but I've seen guys do  it.  I've seen all those videos where the guys have done it just sitting down.  There's ways when you're hanging yourself where you're not just going to break your neck  where it's a slow go to sleep.  You choke out, you choke out, you choke out like you're getting the sleeper hold put on you. 
[01:10:30]  But a gunshot, if it goes wrong, I would always be afraid to shoot myself because it is survivable  and you never know.  Oh, then you wake up in the hospital, you don't have a face.  Fuck, your eye is gone.  Really fucked.  Like the guy who shot himself with a shotgun.  Yeah, I don't want to lose this call.  Ursula in Connecticut.  Kadecki.  Oh, sorry.  Ursula.  Hi, guys.  Hey.  That's Percy, Jimmy.  Hey. 
[01:11:00]  I can't believe I'm actually calling you guys to say this, but it kind of, I've been listening  to you guys for a really long time.  And you're welcome for all the laughs.  Oh, yes.  How about you start with a, yeah.  In 2005, my husband hung himself and. 
[01:11:30]  I had the exact same reaction.  Oh, wow.  Why did he do that?  I have no idea.  I don't know why.  He left me with two two-year-old boys.  And I'm a social worker.  And I mean, I can, I can say logically why he might have done it, but I also think it  was very selfish.  Who found him?  What happened?  My mom found him. 
[01:12:00]  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  So, um, that's why I can't believe I'm actually calling you guys to say this, but, uh.  Be more funny.  What?  Nothing.  Uh, continue your story.  What?  No, we didn't hear you.  Yeah, just continue the story, because, uh, uh, like, what, what did he, what was the problem?  Yeah, and when they found him, was it, was he, was he bloated, or how was he, I mean, I guess. 
[01:12:30]  I don't, I don't know how he was.  Oh, you didn't have, okay.  My mom found him, so, um, but, I don't know, he was, he was a good attorney, and I don't  know why.  Boring.  Oh, God.  So, anyhow, I just wanted to tell you guys, I listen to you all the time, but it, it kind  of struck a, a common thread with me, so I just wanted to call and say, um, that I,  you know, whatever, I don't know why I called.  Are you still, are you still sad about it, or did you not like him when it happened? 
[01:13:00]  Uh, was it, yeah, I'm not, I don't know, I guess I'm still sad about it.  How many years ago was it?  Uh, six years.  Six years ago, and were there any signs?  Um.  You know, before, obviously.  A noose?  It was, yeah.  He was practicing tying knots.  He was tying the noose, so I left for work, so I kind of figured something was going on.  Oh, you thought he had a big social function, and that was a tie?  Hey, wait a minute, you, you saw him actually making a noose, and you still went to work 
[01:13:30]  that day?  Oh, okay.  All right.  Oh, literal hope.  Yeah, but you know what, with our audience, you never know.  What did it, what did he hang himself from?  Uh, in my garage.  In your garage.  Uh, the ballast, the, whatever, the.  The joist above the fucking floor.  Uh, what, uh, and your mother found him?  Yeah.  What was she doing that she came into the garage?  Um, she was actually babysitting for my children, and he did it while they were home, um, while 
[01:14:00]  she was watching them.  And then what'd she hear, like, a call, or something, and, uh, going to the.  Um, I mean, she called me at work, and, you know, and then it just kind of went from there,  but.  Wait, hold on, did she, now, did she hear him do it, or was she, did she stumble into it  later?  She, no, she, she was looking for him in the house to tell him that he could go to work.  Um, she, you know, went into the house, uh, looked for him, said, you can go to work now, 
[01:14:30]  I'm here, and when she opened the garage door to see if he has left, he, um, he was in the  garage.  And there was no, like, depression, or note, or anything?  Yeah, well, no, I, I think that, I think there was some bipolar stuff going on, um, just  looking back now, I mean, hindsight's 20-20.  Right.  But, um.  Put that up.  You know, I'm a social worker, I'm a clinician, it's what I do for a living, and it was right  in front of my face.  Yeah, real perceptive.  Yeah, I'm really good at what I do. 
[01:15:00]  Um.  Might want to go back to school.  You didn't think he was odd when he was sad, he was crying and asking for a ladder for  Christmas?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's actually what I gave him.  Hey, did you, honestly, though, I mean, we're kidding, but did you feel guilty?  How does, how is that?  Because I, I have a lot of people I know have committed suicide, but never in a relationship.  I've never had a girlfriend do it or somebody.  I'm sure many have wanted to.  Wow.  You know a lot of people?  I probably, I probably know nine or ten people that have killed themselves.  Holy shit.  Jesus Christ, really?  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:15:30]  That sucks.  I know at least six comedians.  At least six.  What?  Yeah, it's really sad.  Um, I'm sorry, what was your question?  Did you feel, uh, guilty after it?  No, guilty.  I'm sorry?  Um, I felt, I, I obviously had to go through counseling.  Right.  Because it was, I mean, I was, I was, I went through, I was angry.  I'm still angry.  I mean, I have two boys who don't have a dad.  And so it's hard being both the mother and the father.  So I still, I still, I still deal with anger, but, um, guilty, he, he made his own choice. 
[01:16:00]  I, I probably, I felt guilty in that I, I didn't see the sign when looking back, the  signs were right in front of my face.  But, um, I mean, he, he made his choice and, uh, and so, no, I don't feel guilty.  I was pissed.  I was still pissed.  Sure.  Yeah.  That is very selfish.  More importantly, do you still use the garage?  Um, I'll tell you what, there are, I don't live in that house anymore. 
[01:16:30]  I left, I moved in with my parents and, um, you know, because again, my sons were both  a diaper, I mean, they were so little, so I needed, I needed help and I couldn't live  in my house.  Yeah, actually, you know what you should have done?  Just leave him hanging there.  And when his shoes hit the windshield, you know, you're in the garage.  Oh my God.  Oh, that's the line, you fuck.  Sorry.  She's laughing though.  Sorry, Ursula.  Jesus.  Actually, I never thought of it.  Sorry. 
[01:17:00]  You never know if that trunk is in there, you guys.  Yeah, yeah, that's true.  Yeah.  But I, uh, I was just when I opened the front door, I think, oh my God, oh my God.  So.  Oh wow.  Would you really think that way?  You would go in there after and you would, every time you opened it was a traumatic.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And, and for my mom too.  And I, I wish it was me that found it because she was already crazy.  So.  Oh.  Put her over the edge, huh?  Yeah, I just put her over the edge.  Maybe now she's just the same. 
[01:17:30]  So, um, but, but anyhow, I just wanted to tell you guys about it.  I know it's kind of a personal story, but I, I listen to you guys every day, all the time,  and I felt like I just wanted to share that with you.  Can I ask you guys, actually, it was, uh, it was funnier than Travis's fucking, uh, comedy  bits from yesterday.  Show yesterday.  It's too bad you weren't on that stage.  Poor Travis.  Ursula, can I ask you something?  Have you, have you, have you moved on?  Are you dating?  Are you remarried?  What's going on? 
[01:18:00]  No, I have a boyfriend.  I, um, I might, maybe I'll get married.  I, I don't know.  Life is so hard.  She goes to put on a tie and she goes, no!  Yeah, yeah.  Um, well, Leslie, my boyfriend is a construction worker, so there's no ties there.  Oh, good.  So you're not.  So you're not.  So you're not.  So you're not remarried, you're just hanging out with a new man?  Oh, I see where you went there.  We're gonna hang together.  Just hanging? 
[01:18:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, just hanging.  Keeping it casual?  Ugh.  I don't know, does humor, I, I gotta ask you, does humor help this shit or is this just  beyond morbid?  Absolutely.  No, I laugh about it.  People think I'm crazy.  Like, my, okay, my, at the wake, you know, he's in the casket and my father-in-law, who  had had an aneurysm, like, uh, nine months prior.  Oh, my God.  Well, listen, before you play the laugh track, it's really kind of funny. 
[01:19:00]  He kept saying, and the wake, he kept saying, where's David, where's David?  And I almost looked at him, like, it's the guy over there not getting up.  Oh.  It was, you know, I had to laugh because, I mean, well, I'm tired of crying, so.  Yeah.  You should have said, he's a little tired, he's, uh, laying down for a second, why don't  you go over and say hi?  Yeah, say hi.  God, that's fucked up, man.  So, but, yeah.  I had to leave him, he was a swinger.  Yeah, he was. 
[01:19:30]  Oh, my God.  I wasn't into that.  I'm kind of good not, I guess.  No.  But I'm on my way to work at the prison, so, uh, because my life is so funny.  Isn't that odd that everyone went to the funeral and got choked up?  And he was wearing Air Jordans.  I mean, this is just inappropriate.  It really is.  How many hanging jokes can we do?  Probably a lot.  Don't go anywhere.  Sit down, Ursula.  We have a lot more to do here.  This is going to take a while, right?  The eulogy, he was head and shoulders above the rest by about three feet. 
[01:20:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  All right.  She's tapping out.  All right.  Stay out of the garage.  Hey, I need a tackle box.  Where is it?  We'll go in the garage, uh, duck under the rotting, swinging feet.  I'm sorry.  Oh, God.  No.  Thank you, Ursula.  I'm glad you're laughing.  Oh.  That stinks, though.  Well, you know, the ironic part is I work in a prison and it's my job to make sure that 
[01:20:30]  people don't kill themselves.  Yeah.  So, you know, life is sort of funny that way.  I, so far, no one has died, so I guess I'm doing a good job at work, at least.  Did you think it was weird when you walked in the garage and saw Brooks was here?  Oh, my God.  I did.  Oh.  How are the kids doing there, Ursula?  Huh?  Um, great.  Uh, well, you know, they ask a lot of questions.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  The ultimate. 
[01:21:00]  Oh, no.  This could be one of those days I drive home like, ah, why don't I do that?  And it's raining.  But it probably won't be.  It's raining, though.  That makes it worse, too.  I don't feel good about that one.  I wish it was a bright, sunny day.  I hope that the kids are all right.  She was nice.  Of course we hope the kids are all right.  Ursula is very nice.  It's a great song.  Fuck.  Oh.  So we got a skier, Olympic skier, Jarrett Peterson, killed himself and called 9-1-1 before 
[01:21:30]  he did it.  This is brutal.  You want to hear this?  Yeah.  All right.  Here we go.  9-1-1, what's the other side of your emergency?  I'm at the parking lot.  If you saw the land.  Okay.  You're breaking up.  You're where?  I'm at the parking lot at the top of the land, Amy.  Okay.  What's going on there?  This is so much dirty.  I'm already so much over.  What a fucking idiot.  We all heard what he said, right?  Bug box. 
[01:22:00]  Someone stole your car.  No.  Someone stole your car.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That was it.  Oh, man.  By the way, how depressing his last phone call had to be made on a fucking iPhone.  Oh, geez.  Right?  Where it doesn't fucking go through.  Yeah, there you go.  What?  That did sound like he said something car.  Oh, I heard. 
[01:22:30]  Fucking I'm going to kill myself.  But if you imagine it as, because you know it, imagine it as like someone stole my car  and it does sound like that.  It does?  Play it again.  Play it again.  And imagine he's saying someone stole my car.  All right.  Hold on.  The last part was I want someone to come and get the body.  Oh, it was?  Oh, yeah.  At the top of the land, Amy.  Okay.  What's going on there?  This is so much dirty.  Somebody stole my car.  Somebody stole my car. 
[01:23:00]  I'm going to kill myself and I want somebody to come and get the body.  I want somebody to come and get the body.  There's no more to that, huh?  That was it.  That's all they released.  It said here he was still reeling from the suicide of a friend named Trevor Fernald.  Now, if he's a skier, are those guys typically straight?  I don't know.  Who committed suicide in front of Peterson in 2005.  Wow.  That to me, again, I can't picture two friends doing that.  That sounds like something you do when you're involved. 
[01:23:30]  Peterson had problems with booze and depression and he admitted that he had thought of suicide  and he said it stemmed from a childhood in which he was sexually abused and lost his  five-year-old sister to a drunk driver.  Jesus.  Oh, well, that's a life of misery right there.  Had a bit of a miserable little life.  Wonder himself.  Won the silver medal.  That should take care of all that.  No.  See, you look at it like he won the silver medal. 
[01:24:00]  The Olympics.  Yeah, he's looking at it like I missed winning the gold.  You think?  Yeah.  Every silver medalist wants the gold.  Yeah, they don't march around the country showing off the silver ever.  No.  You don't get that Wheaties box with a silver, do you?  I don't think so.  You just throw that in a drawer.  Yeah, you're like, yeah, second place.  I'll try for the gold in four years from now.  Wow.  That's a depressing call, man.  Yeah, that was pretty exciting. 
[01:24:30]  Just crying.  The last person you talk to is an operator.  She can't hear you.  The fucking Apple.  Call fail.  That's the last thing you see is your iPhone.  Call fail.  Fail.  Boop, boop, boop, boop.  You hear that?  Boop, boop, boop, boop.  Oh, God.  Wow.  Hey, did that guy the other day kill his wife or not?  We ever get an update on him?  I doubt it.  All right.  Who knows?  Who the fuck knows? 
[01:25:00]  Creepy.  Yeah, you know what, Seth?  You're right.  No, Opie.  I'm going to kill myself is just something you say when your car gets stolen.  Yeah, yeah.  That's true, though.  I stole my car.  What happened?  Fuck, you're going to kill myself.  Ah, fuck.  Life sucks.  Wow, that was a sad half hour, huh?  Yeah.  Ursula took it.  She was very nice.  I liked her.  I think there's tears behind that laughter, though. 
[01:25:30]  Yeah, but sometimes you just laugh at the morbid shit.  Yeah, I guess so.  Well, what are you supposed to do?  Jerk off to it.  I just fucking do it.  I learned something today.  I'm no longer friends with Jim Norton.  Everyone around him fucking hangs himself.  Not hangs.  I have...  Oh, just kills themselves in general.  I have one pills.  I thought of eight.  I know there's more, though.  One pill.  Wow.  One train.  One pill.  So that'd be two pills.  One hanging. 
[01:26:00]  One gunshot to the head.  One gassed himself in a car.  Another one who hung himself.  Another one who shot himself in the head.  Not all comedians.  I think of all of them, I think six of those eight are comedians.  Were they close to you?  No, not all.  A couple were.  I would say one, two...  I will guess the one that was closest to you.  Who?  The guy that did it with the train.  No.  Damn it.  He was a guy I knew... 
[01:26:30]  I wanted a belt today.  I knew him fairly well.  I was getting to know him better.  He was a guy I knew in a 12-step situation.  Should have went 11 steps.  Yeah.  We're 13 and get off the tracks.  A couple of them I didn't know as well.  I mean, it's sad, but it is what it is, you know.  Oddly enough, it was the all on the same night after Jimmy did his obese primate joke.  It was.  I said, no, no, but Chunky Monkey.  And I just heard, hang, suit, train, jump. 
[01:27:00]  Hang, suit, train, jump, pills, gurgle.  It was a really amazing, amazing montage of death in one evening.  And they all wrote the notes saying, thanks for nothing, Jim.  Fuck you, Jim.  Die, Jim.  You should be you and not me, Jim.  Holy shit.  I don't think I know anyone that killed themselves.  I know I'm forgetting someone, too.  I'm getting way back now.  I don't think so.  Yeah, I'm not sure. 
[01:27:30]  And I think all of them, to my, had some kind of problem.  One, I think, was just depressed.  But the other ones I know had something to do with drinking and drugs.  Really?  Yeah, this guy Dave.  Otto knew him well, too.  He was a comedian.  And he hung himself.  I think he was a really nice guy.  He wasn't a particularly great comic, but he was a nice dude from Delaware.  And his sister, I think, or his young cousin had overdosed, and he felt responsible.  Oh, boy. 
[01:28:00]  And he was never a fucking good comedian.  But a nice dude.  Fucking guilt shit.  He gave me a fucking foot rub.  My girlfriend was in the room.  He tried, he was like learning massage.  Foot rub?  He was a strong dude.  He was like one of those fucking white guys in Delaware that you'd have to hit with a fucking,  with a house to knock out.  Yeah.  But the nicest dude, and he was, I had foot pain.  And he was rubbing my foot with me and my girlfriend in Pennsylvania.  She's talking about fucking trigger point.  Was it Tony Rocky Hara? 
[01:28:30]  No.  And he wouldn't work his way up the leg despite my scooching down.  Yeah, that was a fucking box.  Yeah, he was a good dude, Dave.  And it sucks for Ursula, obviously.  Sure.  Made it a little fun, but that sucks.  Ursula, a bunch of people want your Twitter name.  I don't know if you're on Twitter, but they want to kind of talk to you.  Oh.  I don't think she wants to hear about her Twitter.  Huh?  Because she's single.  Do you think she has a Twitter?  Oh, you think?  Yeah.  They're thinking easy target?  Vultures.  Ah, good point.  Now they'll just do dumb hanging puns to the portal. 
[01:29:00]  Yeah, that too.  She'll tweet something nice, like, oh, the boys got bees on their reports today.  Here's hang.  No coos.  No joke.  No nothing.  Just being mean.  Mean spirited.  All right.  Let's go to break.  Way to cock block in.  I'm not cock blocking.  What do we got for break?  We're playing highlights from yesterday.  Oh, that's right.  Why don't we play Roland's set and then maybe E-Rock's set next break, since those were the 
[01:29:30]  two best ones.  Yeah, we'll do that.  Sure.  What about your set?  I mean, you can play it if you want.  I wouldn't consider it one of the...  I'd save that for the shit hour.  Oh, it's Anthony.  It's the after show.  Oh, sure.  Why don't I take the staff for lunch?  Confused.  Today?  Why not?  Can we do it next week?  I'm really tired, though.  Well, how about we do it...  You do it today.  I'll do it next week.  We'll get a couple out of it.  That sounds great.  What do you think, Sean?  Where should everyone go?  There's a couple places.  Everybody loves poultry.  I know that.  There's a nice place.  Chicken or their place?  There's a place in Times Square. 
[01:30:00]  I don't want to give it out, though.  Why?  I like carmines.  I don't know if it's too early for carmines.  Carmines?  Pasta?  Sure.  At nine in the morning.  Can we go after the after show?  Maybe next week.  Oh, man.  No, I'm actually thinking we should plan something.  We'll figure something out.  Yeah, we should.  I do want to take you guys to lunch.  Rolling in to break.  The last time we figured something out, it took two years.  I know, I know.  It'll be six months, but that's better than two years.  I guess.  During the... 
[01:30:30]  What do we do?  The best O&A over the weekend or something?  There's some kind of countdown out here?  Yeah, worst of the week countdown.  A lot of that will be stuff from yesterday's show.  All the sets from yesterday's show will be on it.  We're also replaying the Comic-Con special.  And some more stuff on us, right?  For the weekend, yes.  Good.  All right, good.  But into break, Roland from yesterday doing some stand-up.  You're really going to love our first act.  He's the lovable Roland.  Oh, yeah.  Roland.  Roland.  We should talk to Roland before he does his stand-up, don't you think? 
[01:31:00]  Roland is...  Now, Roland...  Hi, Roland.  They can take the mic out of the stand or no, if they want to.  Yeah.  Hello.  Hi, Roland.  Hello.  Are you all right?  No.  Are you a little nervous?  I'm scared.  Aw, Roland.  Aw.  All right, go ahead.  Have fun, Roland.  So, you guys are the ones that are fucked at $12.95 a month.  Welcome.  See, this is the problem we have.  I don't mean to interrupt your act, but this is the problem we have.  You might not be able to understand Roland, which I guess in comedy is probably a bad thing. 
[01:31:30]  Yeah, it's terrible.  All right.  Just, I want to go to a pro on that.  Go out to that.  Don't be afraid of these fuckers.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  There you go.  There you go.  Here's Roland.  All right, Roland.  All right.  Now, and then just slow down a little bit, because I have no idea what the hell you just  said.  You want to start over, Roland?  Yeah, start over.  Sure.  Okay.  It says, so you guys are the ones that get fucked over for $12.95 a month.  Welcome.  Oh.  Oh, I see.  Subscribers.  Yeah, $12.95 is $12.95. 
[01:32:00]  Wait, you were saying $12.95?  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, he said $12.95.  Yeah, we speak Roland.  We talk all the time, and you sound normal when I talk.  I know.  I'm scared.  Oh, wow.  I'm sorry, Roland.  Go ahead.  We should interrupt.  Yeah, sorry, Roland.  In a recent study by Harvard Medical, they said obesity is the number one killer.  As I look around, I say, bullshit.  I've been trying to lose weight recently.  I know.  I took big AIDS weight. 
[01:32:30]  But I just started dressing like a runner.  That's about it so far.  Well, Travis actually is the thinnest one of the whole staff, but I can't do this dye.  I've all come.  I tried that.  Wait, wait.  Wait, hold on.  Actually, Danny right now is passed out because he made Travis the protein shake of cum.  Oh.  Getting personal.  Too much with the tag.  Yeah, actually, Troy Kwan actually believes that the end of the world is next year. 
[01:33:00]  Troy believes the Mayans.  Well, he believes that more than he'll get raised this year.  Is this a company meeting or something?  When has Hooters restaurant become the white trash of American restaurants?  I guess to qualify to work there, you have to have a C-section.  I think that's fine.  Great.  That's all right.  I'm going to steal half of these. 
[01:33:30]  Yeah, recently took a date to McDonald's downtown.  They have a new fine dining restaurant where you actually have to get reservations, and then  they'll take your order and everything.  Does McDonald's now want us to get pussy anymore?  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  No, no, don't get mad at Roland.  I didn't understand that one either.  That implies that you would get pussy if you just took a chick to McDonald's and it was  quick.  Yeah, that was a dick in the ass.  That was a huge dick in the ass. 
[01:34:00]  I'm sharing a New York truck for you guys.  I love how people say they live on the Upper West Side when they actually live on 200th,  30th, and Lexington.  If you live around from the corner from the ghetto, you live in the ghetto.  That was a dick in my mouth.  Lucky boy.  They only give me a week to prepare. 
[01:34:30]  You know how management are.  I love you guys.  They're the best ever.  In the travel magazine, pick New York City.  Again, the number one city, the most visited in the world.  Number two is San Francisco.  Number three is Paris.  Hilton's vagina.  I think that's good, right?  I like this.  Thank you.  I like this little pause there.  The little beat there was good.  How old is that?  And I'm going to Erickson come out here and do some fat jokes, so just boo the fuck out 
[01:35:00]  of him.  Give a nice hand for Roland.  I think that was great.  Roland!  Way better than expected, Roland.  Yeah, good job.  Roland, obviously.  First time ever.  Nice job, Roland.  Obviously, going to his professional comedian friends helped.  Yeah.  That's what we're here.  That's what the rumor is, by the way, that he went to his professional comedian friends  and they wrote his jokes.  If nobody does as well, remember, he cheated.  Series XM.  Series XM.  The Opie Anthony Show.  All right, we're going to get out of here. 
[01:35:30]  No?  Not yet?  Oh.  We got Rashad Evans coming in in about an hour.  Yeah.  That's going to be cool.  He's fighting this Saturday.  Next Saturday.  Next Saturday in Philadelphia, he's fighting Tito Ortiz.  And I'm looking forward to that.  I definitely want to go to that fight. 
[01:36:00]  Because Rashad was...  I thought he was going to fight Jon Jones next for the championship.  Yeah.  And Jones is fighting Rampage.  And the winner of this fight will fight the winner of that fight.  Wait, Jon Jones is playing?  Oh, Jesus.  Fighting in Philly?  No.  No, no, no.  I'm not saying in general.  Oh, okay.  I've seen him fight once, but he was on an undercard.  I want to see Jon Jones fight.  He's fucking great.  Yeah, he is.  But Rashad used to train with him, so he may actually know how to beat Jon Jones.  That'd be a great fight.  All right.  Hey, quickly, for our Facebook page, Opie and Anthony, one of our fans tweeted a video 
[01:36:30]  yesterday.  I retweeted it.  I know Jimmy did.  I'm not sure if Ant did.  But this thing should fucking go viral.  This guy was driving on a highway in New Hampshire.  Can we add it to our site?  And all of a sudden, he sees a lady in a car driving with her hood completely up.  And I don't know how she was seeing the road.  Clit, you mean?  Her clit hood was up.  She was on a highway going at least 55, 60 miles an hour.  I don't know if there was some kind of hole in the hood.  I don't get this video. 
[01:37:00]  When a hood flips up, a lot of times, because of the shape of the, it's curved at the bottom,  so it leaves a little hole where you can kind of see through the bottom.  Did you see the video?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It can be flat against the windshield.  And if you duck down right above the dashboard, there's a little space where you can kind of  see.  Maybe an inch?  It could be.  It depends on how much of a curve is on the hood when you put it down, because it kind  of opens up and makes it like an archway to peek through.  Right.  That's what you're supposed to look through when your hood pops up. 
[01:37:30]  Okay.  And the cool part about this.  That looks like she's just sitting straight up.  It doesn't look like.  Done.  The best part about, here, start this over.  The best part is the guy's listening to our show.  That is funny.  So it makes it just strange.  Four lions.  Very well done.  And they went the distance.  Well acted?  Yeah.  Well acted, yeah.  All the guys were good, man.  Didn't you just keep, like, I mean, you kind of knew because we talked about this.  And now there's the lady.  She's not ducking down, is she?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And again, I'm not saying.  No, but I think there is a big. 
[01:38:00]  If you could pause that one shot where you could actually see the windshield and the car.  Go back a little more.  Just a little more.  He's a little more in front of her.  Right there.  Now, where's she, see?  Where, where's she looking?  It looks like the hood is really, there's a big curve in the bottom of it.  I don't see the curve here.  I understand what you're trying to say, but I don't really see how she's seeing.  I don't see where she's looking.  Is she just looking at the lines to her left and right and saying, fuck it, I'll just stay 
[01:38:30]  between the...  She's looking on the side?  I don't know.  That is weird.  Because she doesn't look like she's crouched down to, you know, look at the bottom of  the windshield.  I think she's drunk.  So, it's a great video.  We'll put it up on our Facebook page.  Oh, it's up there already?  All right.  Opie and Anthony on Facebook.  And, yeah, it's great.  And then the trooper pulls her over and he's using his PA basically.  Pull it over.  Pull it over.  No, I like to think, you know, that's nice that the guy's listening and stuff, but this 
[01:39:00]  isn't one of these scam things where they just kind of put the fucking sound over it.  I thought of that, too.  And kind of distorted it a little, make it sound like it's coming through there.  Yeah, but who cares?  The video's great either way.  Yeah, okay.  You know what I mean?  That's true.  I think the guy was listening.  Because people have been sending me that fucking shopping cart, guy pulling shopping carts  of bottles and cans.  Oh, the guy got a hold of me.  With that.  I know the guy's whole story.  Really?  Yeah, go ahead. 
[01:39:30]  Say what you were going to say.  It looks fake.  It looks set up.  It is fake.  Yeah.  And he admits it.  Yeah.  He does.  It's a character.  But people send that and it's like, oh, dude, check this fucking guy out.  The guy's actually really cool.  I mean, everything you see.  What is that video?  I don't know what you mean.  I've never watched videos.  I've been talking to him.  He developed his character.  I think at first he wanted people to buy into it.  And now it's just a character like you would see anywhere else.  And I think 60 Minutes or one of those news shows did a whole piece on him.  Really?  And we were part of the piece where they show the Opie and Anthony t-shirt and all. 
[01:40:00]  But yeah, enough.  We all saw that video.  I tweeted that thing a bunch of times over the last six months.  The idiot sending me the Casey Anthony mask picture.  Like, I have not seen that one yet.  What is that?  I haven't seen it.  Hey, check it out.  Someone made a latex mask of Casey Anthony.  Hey, you gonna fucking get this?  Hey.  Should I just wear it?  What do you do with it?  I don't know.  Do you fuck it?  I have no idea.  That is creepy, though. 
[01:40:30]  It looks like they tore her face off.  That is kind of creepy.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, and I saw it.  But what do you do with that?  I don't know.  It's a mask.  You want to get the...  Put it on for Halloween.  You fucking kill children.  You want to get the shopping cart guy on the show?  I think I got his info.  Oh, fuck him.  He seems pretty cool.  Can I see a video?  I don't know what it is.  You got that one?  Fuck.  Now we need someone to tweet it.  It's a guy with a whole bunch of shopping carts. 
[01:41:00]  Drunk.  Pulling it with a lawnmower or something?  Yeah, and then the trooper pulls a mower, but the trooper's his brother-in-law or something,  I think.  I don't remember correctly.  They're all in on it.  Why would they do a story on that one video or just do a bunch?  He's done a bunch.  On a lawnmower?  He's done some forklift videos.  This guy sounds like a real ass.  Oh, you're the worst.  It's on our Facebook page.  He found the wrong one, didn't he?  Oh, he's really bad at this.  Of course, the 150 viewers, I'm like, this is wrong.  You're really bad at this.  Get anybody who can Google better. 
[01:41:30]  Oh, Sam took that personally, by the way.  Sam knows he's a terrible guy.  He's not smiling.  He's just like, all right, look, motherfucker.  Sam is not a Googler.  Oh, it's a Halloween mask?  Yeah.  So a lot of people will be wearing that this Halloween?  Yeah.  They'll probably have baby bones.  Yeah, I came up with that.  Oh, you didn't.  Yes, he did.  10, it's north of what?  Half million views.  Lawn mower.  Camera from the trooper. 
[01:42:00]  Thank you.  Driving by on a lawnmower and a whole shitload of things.  It looks fake.  Shopping parts.  Pull over.  Okay.  There's 10-4-20, one of the GMC pickup truck.  He's there on the show where there's another vehicle that's in the low wind.  Pull over right now.  Now they're in some sound of a real speed chase.  Hey, pull that over.  Pull that off the road. 
[01:42:30]  Pull that thing off the road.  Pull that thing off the road.  How's the time they say something like that?  Yeah, now the time is racing backwards.  This is the big of the Crescent City Connection Police Department.  What are you doing?  I'm just going down to my...  I'm having a party.  My buddy Jimmy's out.  Just get off.  Get up here.  Spread your feet out, all right? 
[01:43:00]  I ain't got time for stuff like this.  He doesn't have time for stuff like this?  He's a cop.  It's his job.  What's wrong here?  Got a nice Opie and Anthony shirt on, huh?  I don't care.  That's where he paid this.  Oh, my God.  God dang it.  I know my ride.  I don't care.  I mean, just give me a fucking shit.  God dang it.  Stop resisting.  It's so bad, the dialogue.  You know what, though?  It looks real enough that people are definitely buying it.  Oh, dummies will buy anything on the internet.  They're buying it to the fact that it could be real. 
[01:43:30]  I know my ride.  God dang it.  There you go.  My friend Jerry sent me that.  I'm like, that's just weird.  He said he's a fan of the show.  Jerry who?  Mandarin.  His name.  His fucking name.  It's his name.  It sure does.  Yeah.  Mandarin.  So there you go.  That's been sent to us a lot.  You don't have to send that anymore. 
[01:44:00]  But maybe we'll get the guy in the air.  Thanks.  Remember when we did the American Pickers new commercial thing?  Mm-hmm.  They're doing a little spoof on the Dr. Pepper commercial?  I drink Dr. Pepper and I'm proud.  I'm part of an original crowd.  We decided to put some beeps in it.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  We'll drive across the country on a lead. 
[01:44:30]  Ask 80 and they'll say.  They're looking for the one big to pay.  There's bushy, bushy, bushy, 
[01:45:00]  Highly, bushy, selling,  Wouldn't you like to be a, too?  There's smarty, hearty,  Wouldn't you like to be a, too?  Be a, too.  Watch American Pickers.  Hey, that works, man.  I like that one.  All right.  Put that in the system.  Play that 100 times, please.  Didn't sound like Picker.  Nope.  That's for sure.  Nope.  Cool ad for Dyson, the Daily News today.  You saw that?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, it's a cool fucking ad, man. 
[01:45:30]  Oh, look at that.  He's playing Brooklyn October 1st?  Yeah, tickets go on sale on Monday.  Got a cigarette in his mouth.  DysonBrooklyn.com  That was annoying me  when he was fucking smoking in here.  I haven't been in,  I didn't mind it as much  because I haven't been around it  in so many years  in cigarette smoking doors.  I'm bummed he started smoking again, though.  It feels like aerosol in your throat now,  like to me.  Feels like fucking, like,  like it makes me cough instantly.  Hate it.  It was, yeah, really strange.  You forget.  Yep. 
[01:46:00]  You would go through life  just, you know,  breathing in everyone else's smoke.  Yeah.  You just forget.  It was such a weird thing  to go through the other day.  Yeah.  You're thinking of smoking again?  No, I'm surprised.  I'm bummed he is.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  But it was because he had,  Andrew for so many years  has held the cigarette  and he used it in his act  and he would just gesticulate  and gesture with it in his hand  and it was like,  you gotta get rid of it totally  because you're still allowing it  to be a part of you.  Yeah.  Because you're not diced with or without,  it's like you're diced without it, too. 
[01:46:30]  That's part of his thing  when he does the cigarette thing.  He didn't need that, though.  He goes,  I just don't like him anymore.  I like cigarettes.  I just don't like cancer.  I guess he likes cancer now.  Yeah.  He's gotta get off him.  It's like, come on, man.  You can't be 50 and start smoking again.  You gotta stop.  Cancer.  Wouldn't that be the perfect time  to start smoking?  No.  He got out.  He smoked for years,  then he quit.  Yeah, but how long is the cancer  gonna take if you start smoking at 50?  There's some cancers  that will start and finish  in eight hours.  We got a really hot story. 
[01:47:00]  We got a couple Bulgarian students  in Tampa Bay, Florida.  Dumb, dumb little fucking bitches,  first of all.  They fear hidden cameras planted in there,  and that's where the story ends.  In what, their apartment?  Where they're living?  Hopefully their toilets.  Are you a toilet cam guy?  Who isn't?  What's better than a toilet cam?  Just watch girls going...  Taking their leak.  Can I see a toilet cam video? 
[01:47:30]  I want to see if this is something  I would get into.  It's bad.  You can always tell when it's set up.  I don't think I've ever seen one.  Because they have the fucking cheeks  hanging halfway off the thing,  and you know,  they're doing that until the light gets in.  Because a real toilet cam,  it would just be like a fucking eclipse.  You know what I mean?  It would just be like  watching delicious treats.  Oh, God.  Oh, Sam.  Can you close the curtains,  somebody out there?  Oh, it's curtains for you.  Wait, how did Sam find  toilet cam videos so quickly?  That's quick, huh?  What's that about, Sam?  It's my thing.  You want to X that thing out, Sam?  You're going to fucking  block the duty. 
[01:48:00]  Bottom right.  Here?  Yes!  Sorry.  Oh, yeah.  What are you doing?  Block the asshole.  Forgive my French.  Obviously, these are all  set up toilet cam videos  because it's highly illegal.  Look at her.  There's a fucking guy  standing behind her, I'm sure.  She's a little flush.  She pulls up her dress.  Let me see if I'm into this.  She's pulling down her stockings  and her panties.  Let's keep an open mind on this.  Oh, God.  See, she's squatting.  Of course it's a fucking...  That's an awful European pussy here.  Look at all that piss  coming out of a...  That looks like orange juice.  Hairy vag.  That was terrible.  That's no different  than seeing a horse pee. 
[01:48:30]  Yeah.  Almost looked like a horse pee.  That's gross.  She's not well-kempt.  Get a good shit video  for Pete's sake.  Oh, come on.  Looks like Castro  throwing up after a night  of drinking too much beer.  No, it looked like  the fucking scene  in The Sopranos  when Adriana throws up  in the FBI office  on the table.  That's nice.  Look at that fat vagina.  All right, at least  this one's shaved.  Yeah, it's squatting.  Let's have an open mind now.  My mind's on an open mouth.  Come on, Sam.  What are you doing  not showing me tinkle?  You've seen this.  I want video.  I want video.  I don't want photos. 
[01:49:00]  Jimmy, how about you  write down  a few sites?  Help us out.  What year is this?  Photos.  I didn't put the website up.  I remember jerking off  the pictures  as they were coming in.  Oh, yeah.  You'd have to.  Yeah, I'm just getting  melloncally.  Oh.  Oh, look at that.  That's phenomenal.  She's squatting.  It's from the front  from across like a yard.  Look at that fat vag.  How do you not want  to be under there  being warm and loved?  Warm and loved.  No wiping for her.  No, of course not.  No, it's all wet pissy  fucking wet pissy drawers. 
[01:49:30]  Her pussy is great.  Go down a little bit.  No, no, go back.  She's a skinny girl.  I want to see the vagina.  Just pause it  when she stands up.  She's a slight girl.  Oh, it doesn't pause?  God, she is a fucking  nice one.  I haven't designed  the video either.  Let me see this again.  This is a good one.  She pulls her panties down.  God, look at her pussy.  She's big, man.  I could love her.  Yeah?  Yeah, I really could.  I could date her.  I don't know.  Be her special someone.  Does that turn on in?  There's something odd  about it. 
[01:50:00]  Look at that vagina.  Because it involves the vag,  there is something  kind of, you know.  I just didn't really  cool about it.  I didn't realize  they could release  so much water in my house.  Oh, fuck.  They got it knocked.  Oh, it's a big one.  How come they take longer  in the fucking bathroom  than guys do?  Look at that big pussy.  She's fucking great.  Jimmy loves this.  Yeah.  You found...  Dude, she's fucking smoking.  You found pay dirt.  She's skinny  and she's got a fucking  huge vat.  Watch when she stands up  and she pulls it.  Watch.  Watch when she stands up  and you watch.  Oh, yeah, yeah. 
[01:50:30]  Look at that fucking  giant meaty lips.  It must be nice  to get rid of all your  urine in five seconds.  Yeah.  Not even.  Three seconds.  Yeah.  It's like dumping a bucket.  They're like those helicopters  that put on fires.  Yeah.  Or in the fucking forest.  Fuck, that must be nice.  Instead of going through  a tiny little pee hole.  Just open up everything  and let it just drop out.  Did you fill up a little, Jimmy?  People are asking.  James?  No.  No?  You didn't fill up a little?  Yeah, I'm too busy  arguing with this  cocksucker on Twitter, 
[01:51:00]  Jeff, who's mad  about my fucking alcohol.  What a...  You know what?  You're an alcohol-wise.  This is why I just hate...  I made a joke about  Amy Winehouse's family  thinking that she died  of alcohol poisoning.  And he's just literal.  I hate this guy,  Jeff, in Seattle.  Stop.  Why?  Why would you argue  with those people?  I'm not.  They're never going to  see it your way.  No, they don't want  to ever see it your way.  They just want to...  Direct message blasting  and then blocked.  No, I'm not going to... 
[01:51:30]  I'll publicly smash them.  Last night,  somebody tweeted,  hey, Anthony,  what's with the tweet  every five minutes?  Give someone else a chance.  You know,  I'm tired of reading  your tweets  every five minutes.  I was like,  well, sir,  I could definitely  help you out  on that front  but you won't  have to read any.  And that was it.  Blocked.  But you don't tweet a lot.  You do tweet blasts,  basically.  All of a sudden,  you'll boom, boom, boom, boom.  I do that, too.  I like that. 
[01:52:00]  And then you're away from it.  Yesterday,  it was like a 20-hour  block of time  where I didn't tweet once  in like 20 hours.  I had nothing to tweet about.  Here's what this douchebag,  Jeff in Seattle,  says,  huge Seahawks fan.  True Hawk fans  are being revealed  as the team struggles  these last few years.  I'm a true fan.  You fucking rainy jerk-off.  Seahawks fan.  Well, I guess the pretenders 
[01:52:30]  aren't going to the games anymore,  but the true fans are.  You're a real  dyed-in-the-wool fan.  That is a good thing  that when somebody's  an asshole on Twitter,  you can go back  and read their tweets  and see what they're all about.  That's his profile.  That's his fucking...  And it's a...  He's up.  This is a public profile.  Huge Seahawks fan.  True Hawk fans  being revealed  as the team struggles 
[01:53:00]  these last few years.  What happened?  Are all the fair-weather fans  running away?  Very important to him, Jimmy.  The smart ones?  Very passionate about that.  While you sit there  in that shitty dome,  that's right!  That ticket price is going up,  team's still losing.  You asshole.  Bandwagon fans  are the smart ones.  They go in there winning,  and when the team is losing,  they fucking buzz off.  That's right.  But it doesn't even make sense  because if you're in Seattle, 
[01:53:30]  shouldn't you be  a shitty weather fan?  Yes, you're a shitty weather fan.  What do you mean?  He's outside of the boys.  I think that might have been a bomb.  It's okay.  It's all right.  Boo!  Be more funny!  That's what I'm saying.  Well, you know what it is.  Brother's never fair.  It's always shitty there.  Okay, why are you trying to say that?  Well, no, he's a true fan!  Can we poke your penis  to make sure those toilet cam videos  didn't fucking get you  a little juiced up?  Jimmy?  I'm going to poke his penis.  You can poke it, but Mars, 
[01:54:00]  as long as you use your nose.  You can use the Sharpie.  No, no, no, no.  You've got to use your nose.  Mars, can you poke his penis  with your nose?  No, no, I mean you.  For the show.  For the show.  No!  For the show.  Not Mars.  Mars, don't go that way.  I'm not doing that yet.  Why not?  It's clean.  Let's get to the Bulgarian studio.  Yeah, because otherwise,  you know, you've got to be  a true fan.  True Hawks fans.  You know how many times  this asshole has said that 
[01:54:30]  to people at parties?  Oh, yeah.  You know how many times  this fucking chick is like,  shut the fuck up?  Chick.  I'm sure, and he has a kid  in his Twitter picture,  so he's probably going to  get a wife or whatever.  I just blocked him,  just because he's annoying me.  He's not even that offensive.  He's just annoying.  Yeah.  Fuck him.  Oh, I hate him.  I don't believe in blocking.  I don't believe in blocking.  I rarely do, actually.  No, I don't believe in it.  You don't?  It's true.  Oh, I do it,  but I don't believe in it.  It's true.  It exists. 
[01:55:00]  I try not to,  but he's just annoyed me  because he's a baby.  Fucking baby.  Truth.  That's your badge of honor?  That you go to see the team  when they're shitty?  Yeah.  You fucking idiot.  He's a good guy.  He knows the team.  He's a fan.  Yeah.  Meanwhile, you're irrelevant to them.  You're one more dummy.  Meanwhile, the fucking owners,  the NFL owners  are the greediest cocksuckers alive.  The team loyalty.  I stay home and watch the games. 
[01:55:30]  And what do they do  for team loyalty?  Nothing.  If you have a shitty team  and you're one of those true fans,  right,  still paying full price  for everything,  you would think the owners  would go,  you know what,  obviously no one's going  to the games,  but the people  that are going to the games  are really helping us out here,  so we're going to give them  a little something.  Give them a free bowl  of chili or something.  Nothing, though, right?  They don't give a fuck  about the true fans.  So why should we?  They don't care.  No, you're right.  When the Islanders sucked last year,  I fucking,  I could have taken 
[01:56:00]  six to seven thousand dollars  and just burned it.  I ate so many tickets last year.  I am going to save you  so much money on Monday.  Can I tell you something?  I am saving you so much money.  I know what you're about to say,  and I got something to say about that,  because people have been asking me, too.  Go ahead.  I know where you're going.  I am voting,  fuck you,  on the taxpayers  paying for the Islanders  new fucking place.  If fucking Wang wants him to stay,  let him pay for the fucking team's  new digs.  And you would think  I'd be bummed out about that?  Yeah.  Nope, I'm not at all.  I mean, Nassau County 
[01:56:30]  already pays a shitload of taxes.  It's crazy taxes.  The fans should pay it.  We're the team.  Number one taxed county  in the United States of America.  Yep.  It's the highest taxes  in the country.  And not state.  I'm not talking state.  I'm talking counties.  There's a fuckload of counties  in this country.  And this is what I...  Highest taxed.  And this is what I say  to the Islanders.  Bigger than Beverly Hills.  Fuck you.  That's coming from me,  and I'll tell you why.  I used to be treated  really, really well  at Nassau Coliseum. 
[01:57:00]  Yeah.  Just the little things,  because they know  we have a big audience,  and they knew  I was going to talk  about the Islanders,  and I would give away tickets,  and we would push people  to the games.  They have treated me  like shit  the last four or five years.  And honestly,  I don't even ask for anything.  It's just the basic shit.  Like one year,  they just sold my seats,  because they decided,  I only do a half a season,  because I can't go  to 40-some-odd games.  Yeah.  So I get a half a season.  They decided my seats  should be for full-season  ticket holders now. 
[01:57:30]  Full-season, so fuck you.  So they sold my seats  without even giving me  a fucking chance  at doing the full-season package.  Okay?  A lot of people  have come to me,  and they want me  to go to the rallies  and talk about this  and get the word out  that you need to vote yes  on the stadium  or the new arena.  This is what I say.  Fuck you.  And this is why  you should take care of people,  because in the end,  you don't know  who you're fucking pissing off.  Yeah.  I would have went to the rallies.  I would have talked  positive about it on the show.  I would have had  some of these guys on,  some of the Islanders  and whatnot, 
[01:58:00]  to get the word out there.  We need to vote yes.  But you treated me like shit  for the last four or five years,  so guess what?  You're not getting my support  to help get this vote through.  Fuck you.  But why don't they pay  for their own stadium?  Pay for yourself.  I mean, not that you  as a fan want to pay for it,  but I don't care about  fucking hockey or basketball.  Why should I pay  for the stadium?  It's good for the economy.  I don't give a fuck.  Fuck that.  What, fucking 50 years  down the line?  It'll be good for the economy?  Yeah.  Stop.  How good is the economy  in Uniondale? 
[01:58:30]  Right.  You ever been there?  Go across the street  from fucking,  from the Coliseum.  Drive fucking south  of the Coliseum  for about 100 yards.  Right.  And see what it's doing  for the economy  if you make it back.  But that's what happens  when you don't treat  people properly.  It comes back to haunt you.  Yeah.  I could have helped  a little bit.  I know I could have.  We have a big fan base  and a lot of, you know,  hockey fans.  And if I wasn't sitting there  writing giant checks  for my taxes,  Right.  I might say, 
[01:59:00]  you know what?  Yeah, that's a good idea.  I'll fucking,  I'll vote yes.  Right.  But fuck that.  Why would I want  my taxes going up  now even more?  Blow me, Islanders.  Goodbye.  Goodbye.  And I pay for my season  tickets every year.  I don't ask for nothing.  But it was the little  dumb things they started  just fucking being dicks  about and taking away  from me and, you know.  I mean, they recognized  how much we talked  about the Islanders  and giving away tickets  and promoting them  and stuff that,  all of a sudden, 
[01:59:30]  out of nowhere,  they gave me, like,  VIP free parking,  which, when you go  into a sporting event,  is awesome.  Oh, that's great.  And then one year,  they're like,  oh, no, sorry.  Yeah, yeah, stop.  No, I'll take that back.  You drive through the potholes  in the fucking parking lot.  Which is fine,  to be honest with you.  You know, whatever.  They took it back?  Yeah, I never asked  for that to begin with,  so, you know.  What was their reason?  They're desperate.  What did you say to them?  They want everyone to pay.  So that's now,  it used to be  just a parking lot.  I'm trying to think if, 
[02:00:00]  no, you know what?  I did pay.  It was just a nice area to go.  Right.  You know, you get in easy,  you get out easy.  It was a nice luxury.  Yes, I'm talking about  a luxury.  That I finally got for myself.  Yes.  And then all of a sudden  they decided  they really want people  to pay pay.  Yeah.  Like, over the top pay.  And, you know,  it was just like,  enough already.  They're just sitting  in shitty seats over there  and you raise the ticket prices  every fucking year.  Do they ever lower them?  They raise the parking  without even giving it  a new coat of fucking tar. 
[02:00:30]  How dare they?  There's fucking shit  in the parking lot.  People are getting  flat tires all over the place.  They raised the parking last year  without even making it  look like they made  the parking lot  look a little nicer.  The only way to fix that  is for fans  to stop going.  Watch it on TV.  They'll stop going.  I stop.  I don't care what they,  like, literally if they said  every third person  entering the stadium  is beheaded,  it wouldn't affect me  because I just,  I'm so disgusted 
[02:01:00]  with all of them.  The owners are fucking twats.  Most of the players  are twats.  I have no desire  to support them.  Oh, I can enjoy them  on TV,  but I'm not going to go  and fucking buy  your concessions  and parking.  Fuck you.  And now that they  need everybody,  all of a sudden  I get a call  from the Islanders  recently.  Hey, we're doing a,  we're doing a special  golf tournament  where you get to,  you know,  play with some  of the old Islanders,  some of the current  Islanders,  some prospects  and we really want  you there.  And I'm like,  oh, now they're finally,  you know,  coming back to me  to butter me up 
[02:01:30]  because they know,  you know,  I got a voice  and can get the word  out to get people  to vote.  I say,  fuck you.  Too late.  Fuck you.  That's what I say.  And I'm a huge fan  and I will be at a,  at the shitty Coliseum  again this year.  Certainly.  But I'm not fucking  helping you assholes.  That nice shitty  Coliseum.  And I know it's a  sporting event,  it's a nice thing  to go to,  it's a day out  or a night out.  I understand that,  but the way they  treat fans is to me  is so awful. 
[02:02:00]  And the way they  just,  they fuck you  like that in the NFL,  any Giants or Jets  fan that pays  that fucking,  what's the,  the right to own  tickets?  Oh yeah,  there's a luxury.  You deserve what you get.  Florentine was telling  me that they had to go  through the Giants fans,  people who had tickets  for 30 years  lost their tickets.  Yeah.  Because they couldn't  afford those thousands  of dollars.  For the right to just  buy the tickets.  That their family  has had for 30 years.  Those teams have  showed you people  no loyalty.  It's sort of like  a timeshare. 
[02:02:30]  Yep.  You know what I mean?  It's, it's, it, it, it, it, it makes  no sense.  First of all, you're paying  for the fucking tickets.  Right.  Why do you have to then  pay for the right to buy  the ticket?  They're just fucking you.  What is it called?  The luxury something?  I forget what it's called.  But it gets back to what you  were saying to that Seattle  guy and being a Fairweather  fan.  I told a story, I, you  know, if I'm going to go  to a hockey game, I'm going  to splurge and get some  nice seats.  Seat licenses?  Seat licenses.  And I was, I'm like six or  seven rows up from the ice, 
[02:03:00]  which is just a, just a  perfect place to be.  I like it.  Yeah.  And then when the Islanders  started getting really shitty  last year, they didn't, they  started selling the seats  around me for, for pennies on,  on the dollar.  Right.  And then they don't go to,  you know, you know, people  like myself that.  Oh, and get it, give you a  discount.  Or at least go and say  something like, look, you're  loyal.  You bought, you know, a lot of  fucking games this year.  No, it's all about fucking  fucking everybody over. 
[02:03:30]  Yeah.  In the end, they don't give a  fuck.  That's it.  I get to fuck them over with  my vote.  Yes.  Are you really voting?  Oh, fuck yeah.  I'll tweet it.  I'll fucking be there pulling  that handle.  Saying no.  My cock.  Oh, I'll see.  Yes.  No.  I'm voting no.  Let me say hi to Brian.  Worth my fucking money.  Long Island.  Brian.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I agree totally, man.  I was living, I was sitting in  the same Island district since  I was eight years old.  I finally grew up, started  buying my own tickets and 
[02:04:00]  they were jacking the price  up.  I was like, I actually sat in  your old seats and I said,  forget it, man.  I can't keep paying this  money.  And every year it's more and  more money.  The parking thing is  ridiculous.  So fuck it.  Vote it down.  Let the Islanders go  somewhere else.  Fuck them.  Yeah.  You know, hopefully they'll stay  in the area or whatever, but  Yeah.  Just buy the package.  Watch them on TV.  Yeah.  I mean, sometimes I watch  them on TV, man.  Some of the shit that they  do with the team, but  but it's the loyalty was  what bothered me most.  I'm like talking to the guy.  I'm writing them letters.  I'm like, you've had fans  for forever, man.  Just put on a commercial,  but they, all they wanted  to do was move.  We just wanted to move 
[02:04:30]  our seats.  They wanted to let us  move.  Yeah.  It's ridiculous.  They wanted more and more  money.  They wanted to charge us like  we were just first signing up  for a few seats.  Unfortunately, there's a  desperation happening over  there.  I don't know.  They just maybe didn't run  the organization properly,  but I'm embarrassed when I  go to that place.  I go to all hockey games  elsewhere.  I check out the Rangers,  you know, at the Garden.  I go to, you know, New  Jersey, and I've been to  other places around the  country, and it's  embarrassing.  The presentation for the  game is embarrassing. 
[02:05:00]  Yeah.  It's me and my two older  brothers.  They set up little smoke  machines like you would  see in some horrible rock  club.  And then the Islanders  come out through the  little smoke that they  can muster up from these  hole in the 80s.  But that's all they got.  Yeah.  It feels like minor league  hockey, to be honest with  you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And because the stadium's  so disgusting, too, man.  It's really, really gross to  even walk into.  And then you imagine how  much of a pain to sit in  these crappy seats.  Right.  Horrible plastic seats that  are rotting, basically, at  this point.  The concourse.  You can't even get up to  get a soda or popcorn 
[02:05:30]  because it's so crowded out  there.  Yeah.  You can't move around at  all.  If nobody went, they  would fucking either fold  or do something different.  Anyone who pays those  fucking right to own a  license seats, you deserve  to be fucked.  You deserve what you get.  Literally, if you're willing  to pay, if you had a ticket  for 20 years, and then you're  willing to pay 20,000.  Yeah.  If you're rich enough to afford  it and it doesn't bother you,  that's cool.  But if you pay for...  What's that?  Oh, like corporations.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[02:06:00]  That's who they want.  That's who they want.  They don't give a fuck about  fans.  They want people who can just  afford it without that.  The little guy.  But you know what?  The little guys, they don't  care.  They just fuck you.  But the little things that  they just didn't do for me,  you know, this is how it  comes out.  You know, they wanted me to  kind of support and be one of  the voices that they're  looking for.  And I'm like, fuck you.  Good luck to you, though.  You bought more expensive  seats.  You went closer to the rink.  I mean, what more do they  want from people?  They want our money.  They can't entertain us that  great.  Right. 
[02:06:30]  Forget it.  Yeah.  I've been watching this  stuff forever.  I'm sick of it.  And then they were so  desperate to get people in  the arena.  They're selling tickets right  around where I sit for $10.  I don't even know.  It was like $20 or something.  I'm like, okay, that's all  well and good.  But are you going to do  something for us ticket  holders that have been  loyal forever?  Yeah.  Through a lot of bad  years?  Yeah.  And it's the little  things, by the way.  I don't need the money.  I just need the gesture.  Like, all of a sudden they  come by and go, you know  what? 
[02:07:00]  You guys have been loyal for  so many years.  Here's some shirts.  Right.  Here's maybe hot dogs for  everybody.  A Coke.  Anything.  I don't want the actual  money.  I don't need the money.  I just want the gesture that  someone's like acknowledging,  you know, what I have done  over the years.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We just wanted to move  closer to center ice.  And they were like, no, we  have to charge you full  prices if you're a new  ticket holder and a new  season ticket holder.  Like, get the hell out of  here.  Fuck you.  The fucking price goes up  for you anyway for these  crappy teams.  You can't be loyal to a team  in the end.  It's really tough.  Not anymore, no. 
[02:07:30]  Look at them.  What are they trying to do?  If you don't build a  college team, we're leaving.  Bye.  Yeah, so long.  I'll find something else to  do.  You know, I'll be a little  bummed out because I grew up  with the Islanders, but  enough is enough.  Montreal lost the Expos  because, I mean, that just  wasn't a city that supported  baseball, so it was better  that they left.  And I'm not saying that the  Islanders aren't supported  by their fans, but if they're  not going to build a stadium  and give people something good  that they want to come to,  then leave.  Go.  I mean, I don't care.  The fuck would I care?  I'm paying for that shit. 
[02:08:00]  Yeah, you shouldn't.  But, Gil.  All right, so.  Bye.  Thank you.  Bulgarian babes.  Yeah, you want to move on?  No problem.  Yeah.  Wow, everyone's commenting  about their stadiums and  teams in general.  Yeah.  You never hear a fan.  When Denver built their  new stadium, they said they  weren't going to raise ticket  prices.  That was the first thing  they did.  Of course.  Dude, you never hear anyone  call up and say, hey,  they lowered the prices.  I can't believe they did that.  I think I can't believe they  fucking lowered prices for  never. 
[02:08:30]  Yeah.  Please.  It's all bullshit.  I mean, that's fine.  It's a business, but just  don't act like you're anything  by the business.  Did you see the video?  I see the guy up here.  Matt can help me out.  There's a video where the guy  proved that you get the exact  same beer in a medium and large  cup.  Oh, really?  But they obviously charge  differently.  Yeah.  If you can find that.  Matt in Canada.  Hey, boys.  How you doing?  Yeah.  Help me out with this story. 
[02:09:00]  Paul Allen owns the Seahawks,  and his net worth in 2011  was $13 billion.  He's the Microsoft guy.  Yeah, exactly.  He was selling the small  and the large beer ended up  containing the exact same  amount of beer, and you're  being charged $1.25 more for  the large beer.  So that guy from Seattle can go  get his dickfingered.  The Seahawks are the most  boring, dreadful team to watch,  and he's getting fucked by a guy  worth $13 billion.  Do you know where we can find 
[02:09:30]  that video?  Because I did see this.  Yeah, if you just, uh,  Questfield Beers, Q-W-E-S-T.  And it's right there, and it's,  uh, the guy that's doing it  sounds like he's fucking  retarded, or he's  Yeah.  But it's a, it's a great video.  It's like, holy shit.  I know.  I can't believe that this guy  is talking about being a true  fan, but they, so what they  ended up doing for their  playoff game that they made  in despite being seven and  nine, they ended up charging  people the small beer price  for the large beer, but... 
[02:10:00]  All right, here we go.  All right, thank you.  Hold on a second.  On a large beer from a small  beer, it's $1.25 more  than the other beer.  Oh, then.  Let's go back to that.  It's like a magic trick.  A small beer that's now a large  beer that costs an extra  $1.25 more.  Is it thinner?  Call the cups! 
[02:10:30]  All right, so the cups are  different.  That's all.  The cups are thinner.  And probably thicker.  And, uh...  Basically, what you saw in  this video is he's got, you  know, a certain amount of  liquid, which would be your  beer.  Two full cups.  And it goes up to the tippy  top in both cups, the medium  cup and the large cup.  Small and a large, I think  that was, right?  Yeah.  Small and a large.  I don't think they have a  medium-sized cup.  It's small and large.  The medium wasn't even  talked about.  Yeah.  Shouldn't that be a lawsuit? 
[02:11:00]  Yeah.  Oh, you would think so,  yeah.  Class action.  Well, they're not listing  how many ounces of fluid  would be.  But a lot of times, a  thinner cup will...  So go ahead, you talk  right over the impression.  I was just going to do a  little Dr. Steve, but I  guess you're...  Go ahead, you go.  I apologize.  Sorry.  Sorry.  You didn't have to hang  up, sir.  I was just kidding.  I'm just fucking around.  Yeah.  All right.  Bulgarian students in  Tampa.  We'll go back to the sports 
[02:11:30]  thing another day because  this story is really hot.  A few hidden cameras  planted in their apartment.  Two Bulgarian babes  studying in Florida  made a sickening discovery  in their Tampa apartment.  The smoke detectors were  actually hidden cameras  following their every move.  And by the way, these  Bulgarian babes are  absolutely babes.  Yeah.  This is what I think  happened.  Yeah.  I think this guy saw  like he rents a  rents an apartment.  He sees these fucking  babes come in. 
[02:12:00]  He doesn't have time  for lipstick cameras  and fucking pinhole  cameras and hidden  wires and everything.  He lost his fucking  mind, ran to Radio  Shack and fucking  just threw cameras  and wires willy  nilly.  Just saying, I don't  care.  I need video of these  fucking chicks.  I don't care if I get  arrested.  Yeah, I don't care.  It'll be worth it.  His closet.  He had wires going to  a locked closet.  Wow.  With all the recording  equipment in it.  And then the wires 
[02:12:30]  weren't even hidden.  They were running up to  like smoke detectors  that weren't smoke  detectors.  And then some of them  just looked like a  motion detector, but  there were wires going  to it.  Oh, God.  The guy was so obvious.  Let me slow this down.  For three months, it's a  22-year-old, a 23-year-old,  and another 22-year-old.  All babes.  Yeah.  They were filmed or  recorded while they  slept and showered and  carried on their lives.  Ooh.  Made duty.  Yeah.  And rolled around 
[02:13:00]  naked.  Even when they were  making duty.  Making their muffins.  Making their morning  muffins.  They were making  ca-ca.  Would that be weird if  that was his fetish  you'd like to watch to  make their morning  English muffins?  I make a muffin.  Oh, yeah.  We got video of them  talking.  Oh, really?  It's fantastic.  Yeah.  Authors for his  company, Pizza Babe.  Relisa and Vanya  posed for these  He proposes to be 
[02:13:30]  models and promoters  for his company,  Pizza Babe.  Pizza Babe.  Relisa and Vanya  posed for these  web shots for the  yet-to-be-built  Pizza Babe.  Both say their  relationship with  Armani soured when  they weren't paid  what they were  promised and were  told they weren't  professional.  They say Armani  fired them.  Then this week,  a chef from the  Bollywood staying  at the apartment  found one camera.  They discovered  the rest.  You're not in the  porno industry or  something like this.  Both women wonder 
[02:14:00]  what kind of video  is out there for  anybody to see.  The bathroom and  your room is a  private space because  there is, you take  a shower there.  You make  everything there.  Like, you go to  the toilet there.  Yes, you do.  We only take a  shower in the  bathroom, but this  is enough because  I don't know  somebody to watch  me when I'm doing  this.  Hillsborough  investigators are  trying to sort out  who owns the  equipment and where  the camera signals  went.  Relisa worries her 
[02:14:30]  career goal to  become a journalist  could be in  jeopardy.  If somebody  wants to watch  this, he's not  normal.  He's crazy.  Both women will  return to Bulgaria  in September  and hope this  episode doesn't  haunt them.  Haunt them.  It's Bulgaria.  I love foreign  girls because they  just sound  retarded.  They sound  fucking dumb,  don't they?  Meanwhile, they  know two languages  and we don't.  I know.  They're way smarter  than us because  they know the two  languages, but I  like to think they're  just really stupid  and will do a lot  of things.  Do you think  when they're speaking  Bulgarian that 
[02:15:00]  they sound very  intelligent?  Of course.  Because when  they're talking  like that, we  take shower, very  good, go to  toilet, make  the camera, we  pizza babe.  Pizza babe.  No, I don't  think they sound  like particular  geniuses in  Bulgaria.  Even Bulgaria?  Yeah.  How many chicks  sound dumb in  English that are  American?  That's true.  Of course it  is.  Yeah.  Do you know  two languages?  Yes.  I do.  I know a couple.  I speak French 
[02:15:30]  and English.  Speak some  French.  Parlez-vous  Francais?  Jacques m'a  un sautÃ©.  Un de trois  can't sing.  Un de trois  can't sing.  Un de trois  can't sing.  Un de trois  can't sing.  Un de trois  can't sing.  Un de trois  can't sing.  Un de trois  can't sing.  I count it  for like 15  or something.  That's great.  Yeah, yeah.  Chip L.  Yes.  Chip L.  Chip L.  Chip L.  Chip D is  from when I  was in the  Jersey Shore.  Is that  what they  called you?  In Italy. 
[02:16:00]  You guys  are promoting  Chip TV?  Where can  they find  that?  YouTube  name is  Chip TV  Show.  Chip TV  Show.  If you  just search  Chip TV  you'll find  it.  It's  Chippa TV  is the  name of  the show.  C-H-I-P-P-A-H.  We should  maybe make  that Chipper.  We have  to fix  that little  thing that's  on there.  We're going  to do  some  production  value.  You think  so?  Yeah, yeah.  Chippa TV  is like it  says it  but it's  really  Chipper TV.  He says  Chippa.  Because he  was promoting  it that way.  I mean I  know Chippa 
[02:16:30]  isn't  the best  promoter.  Chippa.  Yeah, we should  fix the TV.  Chippa TV.  Ah.  Hey, you  think that  landlord will  do less  time because  they were  so hot?  Might do  more time  because they're  hot.  Yeah, but I  mean if they're  kind of piggy  and you're  doing that.  Naive.  Then the jury  and maybe  the judge  look at you  like, oh  God, you're  a creep.  It's almost  like, you  know what I  mean?  They're so  hot, like  how could  you not? 
[02:17:00]  See, here's  what I'm  thinking.  It's almost  like drug  sales.  Right.  The fat  chick is  like a  small amount  of drugs.  That's cool.  The fat  chick is  like a  small amount  of drugs  for your  self-use.  Okay.  Because, you  know, you'll  tape it and  just jack off  to it yourself  maybe if you're  into fatties.  It's like, I'm  just getting  high on this.  Hot chicks, you  want to  distribute.  That's like  having a kilo  or two and  you're going to  be fucking  distributing this  shit because  they're hot.  Goddamn, you  have an answer. 
[02:17:30]  I love it.  I was thinking  that might be  it.  So it might  be worse.  Yeah, yeah.  Because now  you are spreading  the goodness.  Yeah, the  goodness.  You're not  just some  dumb pervert  in your house  jacking it  to some fat  chick.  You don't  want people  to know that  you're jerking  to a fat  chick that  is your tenant  downstairs.  Punishment  enough.  Good point.  But these  hot chicks, you  could sell that  shit.  Oh, you can't  help yourself.  You're in  Starbucks.  Yeah.  Look what I'm  looking at  every night  illegally.  The camera  and they're  pointing at  a thing that  looks like a  camera coming  out of the 
[02:18:00]  wall with  wires going  to it.  The wire, they  trace it back  and they try to  open the closet.  It's locked.  They're hearing  their own audio  from inside the  closet.  Didn't they  kind of have  that in  Kentucky Fried  Movie?  It was supposed  to be hidden  cameras but they  were right out.  giant cameras  right out in  the open and  they were  oblivious to it  still because it  was hidden  cameras.  Well, if you  remember also  from Catholic  School Girls in  Trouble?  No, Revenge of  the Nerds when  they put the  hidden cameras  in the hair pie 
[02:18:30]  fucking sorority  house and they  had to cut these  giant holes in  the ceiling and  put these giant  cameras in the  attic.  That's ridiculous.  Oh, we've got  Bush.  That's the famous  line.  Can you go back?  I'll start  over.  Oh, Booger.  Yeah.  Booger.  My friend just  saw him in a  He got Bush.  Oh, hell  pie.  He was just  in a curb.  No, my friend  just saw him in  a restaurant.  Oh, really?  And she took a  picture with him  and she showed 
[02:19:00]  me the photo.  He actually  looks, he's a  little gray in  his beard but he  still looks fucking  great.  Well, that was  only, what, five  years ago or so.  Six, I think.  Six?  Yeah.  Oh, I thought  that was the  80s.  No.  No.  That's indignant.  Yeah, we've got  Bush.  He said, I got  it from a  Negro, right?  No.  That came from  Caddyshack.  That's Caddyshack,  yeah.  Oh, I said that  was Booger.  Oh.  On the dock.  Shake her  booties down  by the dock. 
[02:19:30]  Is it chilly  in here?  No, Spaulding  said I got it  from a Negro.  Oh, was it?  Yeah, that's  right.  Yeah, sorry.  Yeah, yeah,  it was in front  of the hippie  kid.  Right.  Yeah.  Why don't we  take a break?  Rashad Evans  should be here  very soon.  Ooh.  We're going to  talk to him  and then start  our fucking  weekends.  Oh, my God.  Look at it.  It's nine already.  I'm going to  tussle with him  a little bit.  What do we want  to play into break?  Another clip  from yesterday's  fine live broadcast?  I would.  I think the  E-Rock clip  is classic.  I would suggest  we do a live 
[02:20:00]  read and then  play E-Rock.  What?  That's right.  You mean like  right now?  You ain't no  motherfucking fun,  Sam.  I know.  You mean like  going and saying  something like  the second season  of HBO's  Eastbound and Down  comes out on DVD,  Blu-ray and  digital downloads,  August 2nd,  like that?  Exactly.  In season two,  Kenny Powers,  he heads south  of the border,  to lick his  wounds and  live like an  outlaw in  Mexico.  He's joined  by his  hambracito,  Stevie 
[02:20:30]  Jankowski,  his name is  actually,  or Janowski.  I have trouble  with those  Polish names.  And in the  pursuit of  becoming a  new man,  Kenny loses  his cock,  shoots his  friend,  insults the  locals,  finds a  hot senorita,  steals a car,  makes a big  league comeback  and gets  thrown in the  Mexican slammer.  Jesus Christ,  picture that  just popped up  there.  And that's  the PG version,  by the way.  So buy this  season two 
[02:21:00]  box set on  DVD,  Blu-ray or  digital download  and experience  Kenny Powers,  Mexico.  Then,  go take a  shower.  the star of  this show.  The man you've  all come to  see.  So put your  hands together  and give a  warm welcome  to Eric  Nagel,  the sex  bagel.  Ah,  shit. 
[02:21:30]  Ah,  coming out  to a little  collab duel.  There it is.  There it is.  He's hating this.  They're chanting  his name.  D-O-D-E-R-O-D-E-R-O-D-E-R-O-D-E-R-O-D-E-R-O-D-E-R-O-D-E-R-O-D-E.  Wow.  What's up,  Hardrock?  How are we doing today?  Before I start,  if you could  indulge me a little  bit here,  and you know I like  to indulge.  Can we just  give it up  for the troops I don't really care about the troops but I wanted to get applause at least 
[02:22:00]  once while I'm up here as I said my name's Eric you may know me as Iraq on the show  sex bagel 2 and I got the name Iraq not necessarily because I rock it's because it's the only thing I  don't eat well correction can't digest  Jesus look at this audience look at the size of this audience I feel like I'm back in the 
[02:22:30]  Weight Watchers meeting here never at one that's like saying I was back on Jupiter  well yeah I guess you're right I shouldn't be the one making fat jokes I mean look at me  a couple years on this show and I've gained a ton of weight  what are you Kathy  hack  hack my swimsuit but uh you know being fat it's it's taken its toll I mean if I stand next to 
[02:23:00]  Roland we look like the number 10 but he's the number one get it  you look like a couple of zeros  that joke was number two  well it's because I was the fat zero  I know  you're not a fat zero you're a good boy  I wouldn't  what are you his mother  yes you're not  all right you have four hours not to say anything let me just do this 
[02:23:30]  fuck us running as Anthony would say you're right we apologize  I wouldn't say like I would stand next to Roland I mean you can if you're a fan of  not having sound and light reach you  oh shit  sorry Roland  what about Sam's riveting vasectomy story earlier wasn't that fucking brilliant  let me ask you a question here 
[02:24:00]  Sam's a piece of shit right  I don't have a punchline I just wanted to see if we're all on the same page here  people on Broadway have no idea why they're going yeah  speaking of his haircut look at that fucking thing looks like a q-tip that was shoved up  Roland's ass 
[02:24:30]  this is going well  it is it is it is  ah staff stand up  you're probably wondering whose genius idea this was  well it came from our own poster boy for the make a wish foundation Jim Norton over there  oh that's nice  and Anthony Cumia you know the Nazi  and then Opie  well that's too easy  alright maybe the Nazi comment was a little harsh you know I'm not saying that's racist 
[02:25:00]  but Mel Gibson twittered him and said you might want to tone it down  hey when Gibson twitters you dude  well we could go back to Opie but uh  nah it's still  it's easy to do it  you're not taping this?  how are we going to go viral?  oh shit  oh shit  oh shit  oh shit  oh shit  I mean look at this this has legs 
[02:25:30]  oh oh oh  wow  oh oh E-Raw  here's E-Raw  How much time do I have left here?  Sam's still a piece of shit, right?  Sam's still a piece of shit?  Make sure we're all in agreement here.  You know, you learn a lot from doing a job like this,  working on the Opie and Anthony show.  This is the big leagues, top of the radio game,  Sirius XM, 20 million subscribers,  heard in two countries, online feed that doesn't work. 
[02:26:00]  If working here has taught me one thing,  it's that I could do better.  A lot better.  Coincidentally, same thing my wife said to me during our wedding vows.  Ah, the poor dear.  Stand-up's difficult, you know.  I thought, you know, being a kid at a Norwegian labor camp 
[02:26:30]  was more difficult than this.  What?  What?  What?  Topical and brutal.  Very good.  Too soon?  What am I, too late?  Did I miss the boat on Norwegian shooting jokes?  Fucking comedy's all about timing.  Well, I guess that about does it for me.  Look, I know a lot of you probably think I'm not funny.  A lot of you probably think I suck dicks. 
[02:27:00]  But last time I checked, my name isn't Whitney Cummings.  Thank you very much.  Oh, damn.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  Good job, E-Rock.  E-Rock.  Going for the throat, E-Rock.  Wow.  Good job, E-Rock.  Good job.  Good job.  Very good job.  That was really good.  That was the big surprise of the day for me.  I didn't think he would do that good.  He did very well.  It was all that bile.  If you've got nothing better to do right now, why don't you call the show? 
[02:27:30]  866-WOW-1-WOW.  That's 866-969-1969.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  Very cool.  We got Rashad Evans outside the studio.  Get him in here, man.  We got the UFC 133, Evans versus Ortiz.  Live from Philly.  I can't wait.  I'm going next week. 
[02:28:00]  On pay-per-view, of course, next Saturday night.  And it's SugarRashadEvans on Twitter.  Without the R.  S-U-G-A RashadEvans on Twitter.  So start following Rashad.  Welcome to the show, bro.  Oh, man.  Thanks for having me on.  How do you feel about morning press?  It's hard to get up for.  It's hard to get up for.  You know, last night I hung up, you know.  But it's hard to get up for.  Where were you hanging last night?  Getting up, thanks.  We went to Abram Arthur's and then hung out at SL a little bit.  Because I just flew in.  I couldn't get to sleep.  So I needed to hang out a little bit. 
[02:28:30]  See what's going on, the vibe of New York City.  How long before a fight do you stop, you know, partying or doing any late nights?  You know, for me, I stay up late anyways, you know.  But it's about just getting out and doing things like I normally do.  So I don't do it like a week before or nothing like that.  But when I go out and hang out, I just hang out and drink water and watch everybody else.  And maybe I'll dance a little bit.  But for the most part, it's just about just being relaxed.  Because what happens sometimes is you make the fight too much of a spectacle. 
[02:29:00]  And then when you get in there, you're like, oh, my God, this is it.  And you make it such a big deal.  But it's something you do every day.  Oh, so you try to keep your routine going as much as possible.  Yeah, try to keep my routine going.  And just make it, you know, so I'm not, you know, making such an event out of it.  And then when I get in there, I'm not going to be too nervous.  What do you do if you can't?  I can see that.  Like last night, I got like two hours of sleep.  And I just, I'm a bad sleeper, even though I'm used to it.  What do you do when you can't sleep before a fight?  Like the night before you're tossing and turning and you're sluggish.  You know, you feel sluggish all day.  And you're like, I know I don't have the energy. 
[02:29:30]  Yeah, that's what happens sometimes.  It used to happen to me early in my career.  Like I would get so nervous and thinking about the fight so much, I wouldn't get a lot of sleep.  And then when it comes to, you know, fight time, I got to drink some coffee to get myself up.  Because I stayed up half the night.  I think if you miss one night's sleep, it's okay, though, right?  Oh, totally, yeah.  Yeah, I mean, because you're resting up.  But for the most part, if your mind has been busy for just that one night, chances are it was probably busy many nights before.  And you really haven't been getting any restless sleep.  I can't answer Jimmy, though.  Every once in a while, I get the insomnia.  I get up and I have a nice glass of milk. 
[02:30:00]  No way.  No, yeah, dude.  That's a god of the movies.  What do you think about that?  I drink it right out of the carton.  Walk around my apartment for like two minutes.  Go back to sleep immediately.  Because they say you got to get out of the routine.  Because your mind's just like...  When you're laying there, you can't just keep laying there.  They say the best thing to do is get the fuck out of bed for a few minutes.  Check your email.  Do anything else.  It just resets your brain.  Yeah, but I'm a pervert.  So if I check my email and I see one escort has responded, it's the next four hours a shot.  So I'm not going to be able to pull myself off the computer. 
[02:30:30]  He's a big boy.  What is it with a glass of milk?  I've never seen just walking around with a glass of milk, just drinking milk, huh?  Right out of the carton.  Just a few sips.  I don't know.  Maybe it brings me back to breastfeeding or something.  No, my mom decided not to breastfeed me, which means I have lots of issues.  How awkward would it be if you came in and we all just started crying about our childhood?  I'm tired.  He wasn't breastfed.  I don't think I was breastfed.  Were you breastfed?  I don't think so.  Really?  Nah.  I mean, I had a lot of brothers and sisters, man. 
[02:31:00]  Could you imagine that?  One of eight, right?  There's like eight of us.  My mom's sister would be on the floor.  If we all breastfed, it'd be crazy.  I was breastfed.  I feel a bond with my mother.  Yeah, my mom had a lot of kids, and her uterus is now hanging out of her body, but that's  the price she pays for having so many kids.  Oh, my.  You were one of seven?  Yeah, one of seven, Rashad.  Oh, okay.  All fighters, too, just like yourself.  See, that's what's up, man.  Is that why you're a fighter?  What happened to you? 
[02:31:30]  That's a good question.  I'm still trying to figure that out.  Nah, we're good.  Do you start fighting because you had older brothers that would...  Because a lot of fighters have big families, it seems like you get, you know, because  you're older brothers.  Well, where do you fall?  Are you...  I'm the fifth one.  I'm the fifth one of...  Okay.  Of seven that grew up with my mom.  Oh, so you must have older brothers that are real tough.  You know what?  My oldest brother above me, two years older than me, my mother used to make me hang out  with him, and she would...  He would always beat me up every single time, like, we got away from out of her eyesight, 
[02:32:00]  so he would, like, do, like, some really mean stuff to me, like, make me walk, like,  ten steps behind him, and if I got too close, then he'd beat me up.  And if I said the craziest...  I mean, if I said anything, I was getting beat up.  So I got tougher because I had to, and I was hanging out with him and his friends, and  I was, like, the little dude, so I always had to fight and prove myself.  Is he a fighter or anything like that?  Yeah, he does.  He does fight a little bit.  But you kick his ass now, right?  I mean, you know. 
[02:32:30]  What's your relationship with him?  Is it a good...  Like, do you look back at those days and go, ah, that was just a brother being a brother,  or do you kind of resent him for it?  Nah, he's my best friend, though.  Oh, yes, okay.  He's my best friend.  You're close with everybody?  Yeah, pretty much.  Yeah, we have a big family.  We're really close.  Yeah, I mean, you know, when you have such a big family and, you know, single-parent household,  we really lean on each other for, you know, emotional support, because my mom was always  working and stuff, and she really couldn't do it, so we just leaned on each other a lot.  Too late again, my mom was always crazy, so we had to stay close to each other.  Single-parent household, basically. 
[02:33:00]  Yeah.  Because my mom was on her own fucking trip all the time, so it made us closer, though.  Yeah, it does, man.  I'm relating to this guy.  Yeah.  And you'll relate in many ways until it comes to fists, I know, and doing man things.  But, I mean, I relate.  I don't have a big family at all, but, I mean, I'm kind of, like, obviously, I'm, you know,  I've done a little MMA training.  How little?  Like, play the video game?  That's about it, yeah.  How little can you do that?  I was hoping he'd go, really?  Like, I might have the illusion that I've done something masculine.  I don't know.  You never know.  You can't judge a book by its cover. 
[02:33:30]  You know, I mean, you look at half the guys on the UFC roster, most of them look like  somebody you might pick on if you see them in the street, because they just don't look  that, you know, intimidating.  Right.  Uriah Faber.  Think about it.  Yeah.  I mean, now we know what he looks like and all, but when you see him walk through this  door, you would, you know, if you had a problem with whatever on the street, you might take  your shot.  You might.  That'd be the dumbest thing you ever do, obviously.  I mean, he looks like somebody you can push down.  Like, you can push him down, and he might stay down and be intimidating.  But in all fairness, he's the real deal.  He'll fuck you up.  Yeah.  He's a little monster. 
[02:34:00]  He's a beast.  Yeah.  How much do you weigh?  What are you, 210?  205?  I look that skinny.  Nah.  Oh, damn.  Nah, I'm at 220 right now.  Isn't that heavyweight?  Well, I dropped down at 206.  So what happens is I stay at like around like 215 until about a week before the fight, and  then I drop down to 206 and then go back up.  So you're at around 220 right now?  Yeah.  So you're going to have to lose 15 pounds in a week?  Yeah, but it's really nothing.  But how do you do that?  How do you do that?  Because I want to do that.  It's like, it's really nothing.  No, I think it's different than, you know, somebody that, you know, maybe doesn't work 
[02:34:30]  out as much.  I think we could be pen pals for a week, and I'll do whatever.  I'll do the exact same thing he does, and I'll drop 15, too.  Just do a lot less of it.  Like, if you run five miles, I'll run a block.  You know what I mean?  I might not lose as much weight.  I'd like to see that.  But how do you do it?  That's kind of fascinating.  It's mostly just water weight.  I can, like, if we went to the sauna, I bet you you could lose, like, probably about 10  pounds in a sauna.  And your dignity.  Yeah.  What, in one sitting?  No, not in one sitting.  You have to do a couple sessions because I don't know how good it is. 
[02:35:00]  He's looking at my gut.  No, I don't know how good it is.  I don't know how good it is.  You see how he's talking to me?  Yeah.  He saw my problem area.  Yeah.  My little paunch.  So what?  So you do a lot of sauna?  Do you start just eating almost nothing?  But you have to keep your strength up.  Like, the few days before, you cut your sodium down to, like, you drink, you know, eat nothing  with no sodium.  And then you start to just start flushing your body out and, you know, weigh-in day, you  just go to the sauna, sit there for about, I do about, I'm probably like a five-session 
[02:35:30]  guy myself.  How long is a session?  About 15 to 20 minutes.  Oh, that's okay.  And then you do them, what, do you take a little break in between?  You do them in a row?  Yeah, a little break, but not too long, because you don't want your body to stop sweating.  So just enough to kind of, like, so you don't go crazy in there.  There's guys in there, when they're cutting weight, they got the sauna suits on, and they  just start going, like, absolutely crazy.  Like, you see it, they look in their face.  And that's why, like, you get so surprised when you see guys, they're not going to make  weight, and they just don't care, because that's what the heat does, so you get crazy 
[02:36:00]  in the sauna.  Wow, really?  So, and then you have the official weigh-in, right?  Right.  And then, do you drink water immediately, because then it doesn't matter how much you  weigh?  Yeah, I drink a little bit of water.  Some people do IVs and stuff like that.  To get the water back in.  To get the water back in.  Because what happens if you, you know, the first thing you want once you start cutting  your weight is you want water.  So you can drink all your liquids back, but then after you drink your liquids, then you  can't eat.  Right.  Because you're so full from your liquids, so people do the IVs, and that way they can  leave some room for the body to eat some food.  Wow.  What's the most weight you can put back on? 
[02:36:30]  Because I know that they said that Brock will put a shitload of weight on after the weigh-in.  He can put on, what, 15 pounds or 20 pounds?  How much can you put on in a day, so you're heavier for the fight?  It all depends on your natural weight.  Like, myself, I stay around, like, 215, 217, so I'm not going to go much beyond that.  But some guys that are big, like, you know, like you said, Brock, they have to cut a lot  of weight, they can put the weight back on fast and rather quickly because their body  is naturally going to try to get back to that weight.  I think that would tire you out somehow.  Sounds exhausting. 
[02:37:00]  Yeah, that's why I like to fight light because I don't, I hate the feeling of feeling, like,  bloated.  I got to feel, like, hungry and light when I fight.  Yeah.  And 206, what is it up to, is up to 206 light heavyweight?  And then after, how does it break down?  It's 205, the weight class is 205, but for non-title fights, it's always 206, they always  give us a pound.  Okay.  So, but then after that, then it's a heavyweight, which is a 265 weight limit.  How are you feeling as far as Tito goes?  I'm feeling good.  I'm feeling confident.  I had a great training camp, you know, great training partners on Boca Raton, Florida, 
[02:37:30]  and I'm just ready to get in there and fight.  Right.  Do you know John Jones?  We were discussing that earlier.  Oh, yeah, you know.  No, what's the...  Oh, really?  I don't like John Jones.  Is it a real...  It's because you guys were close at one point, right?  You were training partners?  Yeah, we were training partners, and then, like, you know, some stuff happened, and the  next thing you know, we were supposed to fight each other, and after that, we just didn't  like each other.  Well, you were going to fight each other. 
[02:38:00]  What happened?  Did one of you switch the fight, or did he not want to fight you?  Well, what happened was we were supposed to fight each other, and then he supposedly had  to have thumb surgery, which he never ended up having, and then elected not to have it after  I was already booked to fight somebody else.  So, is this fight going to ever happen?  You know, it depends on how things run.  Yeah, I mean, I'm going to have to, you know, take care of next weekend.  Sure.  And then, after that, we'll see if he gets past Rampage, which I'm pretty sure he will,  and then after that, we'll see what happens. 
[02:38:30]  Oh, you got this Ortiz fight.  Yeah, I think I got it, too.  Yeah, yeah.  But, you know, it's MMA, you know, and the thing about MMA, crazy stuff happens all the  time.  So, when I go out there, I just got to be on my P's and Q's and just making sure, you  know, I don't have any lapse in concentration, because sometimes you'll be out there, and  like, the craziest things may pop into your mind, and you're like, okay, back to the fight.  Really?  Yeah, it's crazy.  Like what?  Yeah, really?  I was fighting Forrest Griffin, right?  And I'm taking, and I took him down, and, you know, I was hammer fisting him, and then  I'm inside of his guard, like I'm inside of his, you know, with his legs closed around 
[02:39:00]  me, and my head is on his chest, and I look up, and I'm like, man, Forrest's got a hairy  chest.  In the middle of a fight.  In the middle of a fight.  And then I was like, whoa, whoa, whoa, back to the fight.  I wouldn't think that shit would happen.  That's hilarious.  That's a good one.  I mean, it's a bunch of stuff, man.  Like, you know, you may be fighting, and you may move it out there, and then somebody  says something crazy, and you're just like, did he just say what I think he said?  He's like, back to the fight. 
[02:39:30]  That's funny, man.  That's really funny.  Because you wonder if somebody, because a lapse in concentration, it could cost you a  knockout.  Oh, yeah, it definitely could, man.  It definitely could.  Like, I remember I got caught in a fight because of it.  Like, I was fighting Tiago Silva, and I was winning for like three rounds, and it's third  round, third minute into the fight, and I'm pretty much having my way with him doing what  I want to do, and my coach is cornering and yelling at me, don't do this, don't do that,  and I guess I'm kind of like, when I'm taking a breath, I'm resting a little bit on my feet, 
[02:40:00]  and then as they're telling me to do this, I'm in my mind thinking, like, coach, listen,  I got this in a bag.  There's nothing going to happen.  I got him.  And then he throws a jab right across, and then I see the punch, and I'm like, okay,  I see the punch.  And then the cross slipped right through my fingers, and I got caught on the jaw with him.  Oh, shit.  And I was like, oh.  And I'm rocked, like dizzy.  Like, I'm drunk driving, can't stand up on my feet.  And I'm like, oh, man, hell no, not again.  When you get hit like that, because you see guys get hit like that, it's amazing to me  that people can recover and keep fighting when they get hit, like, with a point where 
[02:40:30]  you know they're ready to go down.  What is your instinct, just to hold the guy, or do you start looking at the clock?  Yeah, like, you know what?  For me, it's just to try to grab a hold of him and try to sort my brains out.  Because normally, it's not that I'm, like, I'm dizzy, but it's like my legs are not working.  Like, my legs feel funny, like I can't feel them.  And then I'm like, oh, man, I can't feel my legs.  And then your legs start coming to you.  They're like, okay, now I feel better.  Because when I got knocked out of the fight, I lost to Machida.  Like, I got caught with a punch. 
[02:41:00]  And then I was in denial that I wasn't even hurt, because I was in such good shape.  I was, like, in denial.  Like, I'm not hurt.  I'm not hurt.  I'm like, fuck that.  I'm not hurt.  And I kept, like, falling down.  And it didn't get any better.  Wait, did you go down and stay down, or did you get up and then fall back down?  I got up, fell down, like, three times, and I got knocked out.  Were you taunting him in that fight, too?  Yeah, yeah.  I was trying to, I guess, lose how I won.  Because I didn't think it didn't feel like when you're in there and you're getting hit,  it doesn't feel like anything.  It just feels like if, you know, you had a camera and you're watching TV and something 
[02:41:30]  just goes in front of it and it shakes the camera.  And that's what it was like.  I couldn't feel any of the punches.  And I was like, man, he doesn't really hit that hard.  I don't know what's wrong with my body.  And then next thing you know, I'm sleeping and I'm snoring.  And then I'm like, oh, man, I think I'm knocked out.  I think I'm knocked out.  Yeah, and I'm thinking this and I'm thinking it, like, as I'm coming to and I'm like,  I think I just got knocked out.  And I'm like, oh, I'm snoring, too.  And I was like, dang, this is embarrassing.  Wow.  So you think that as you're coming out of it?  Yeah, that's what I was thinking right when I started coming around.  Like, some people, like, wonder what happened.  And you really snore? 
[02:42:00]  Man, I was snoring.  The second you started coming to, did you know exactly where you were?  Or were you just like, oh, I'm tired, eh?  You know what?  I felt very rested, I'll tell you that.  I felt very rested when I got out.  Maybe that's what I need for my head.  Yeah, I need Machida to come over and punch me in the face before bedtime.  You need to get knocked out.  It's the best, like, so if you walk around the corner and somebody just, like, sucker punch  you and then you just go to sleep, you just miss a piece of the movie.  That's all.  Do you get nauseous when you get knocked out like that? 
[02:42:30]  Like, concussions that don't make you really queasy?  To me, that would be the worst part of it is the vomiting after.  Yeah, some people do get nauseous and get concussions, but I never had that.  You know, when I got knocked out, it was just a smooth knockout.  And I was like, man, you know, that was weird.  Damn, I got knocked out.  Yeah, trying to figure out what happened, like, trying to piece together the events  that caused the missing of time.  You take a punch like that to the jaw, right?  If we took that punch, our jaws would be shattered.  I don't understand why you guys don't have more broken jaws and stuff from these hits.  I don't know, man. 
[02:43:00]  You know, I think it's got a lot to do with the trainer.  We're just so used to it.  Our body gets used to it over a period of time to the point where we build up a bit of  resistance to it.  Because jabs don't even look like they hurt, but you know they do.  Like, can I just throw in jabs at you?  That's a real man punching you in the face.  And one of the, a jab from, like, Rashad would destroy our face.  Yeah.  It would break everything.  The worst part is, like, when you catch a jab and it's, like, you know, it's not really  at hard, but it catch you in a spot that makes you, like, have to react to it.  Because that's the point of a jab is to try to get you to react so they can set up something 
[02:43:30]  else.  So if you get hit, like, in the nose or if you get hit in the eye and your eye was open  or something like that and then you got to blink or got to try to move your nose or something  like that, then that's when you get to watch out for the other punches.  Yeah.  Hardest place to take a hit where you're like, oh, that just sucks.  The body shot, the body shot, because it's one of those things that, like, you get hit  and then you don't really know how bad it is until you start to, like, move a little bit  and then it's, like, taking a little bit of your air.  I remember I got punched in the body one time and I got punched in the chest by Shane 
[02:44:00]  Carlin.  Shane Carlin is our big heavyweight.  Yeah.  And we're just, like, sparring with the big gloves on, but he tried to hit me with an  uppercut and it went by me and I'm like, ha, ha, ha, too slow.  And then I moved and then I was like, something's wrong with my chest.  And I realized he just punched me in the chest and it felt like he separated my sternum, man.  I was like, this dude is too big for me to be sparring.  It's funny, too, because whenever you think someone's unbeatable, somebody beats them.  That's what UFC is, like, so different than boxing.  Shane looked unbeatable.  Like, there's nobody can beat this guy.  And then Brock beat him and then Dos Santos beat him. 
[02:44:30]  Dos Santos beat him, yeah.  It's like all these guys, there's, like, a weird parody in UFC that you don't see in other  physical sports.  And that's what makes it fun to watch because you never know, you know, whose day it's going  to be, you know.  You think somebody's your favorite fighter and they're going to beat everybody who you  think, you know, on paper, but then they go out there and it's just, it's just not,  it's not that day.  Tito Ortiz, I was amazed.  I was at the last fight where he fought, I think, Bader.  And it's like he came in so hopped up and so showboating, like, I'm ready to fight.  I'm like, he's going to get destroyed because he's acting like I would act if I was scared 
[02:45:00]  and trying to pretend I could fight.  And he beat the shit out of it.  I've never seen Tito fight like that.  And it was like, man, he really looks like, it's like he wasn't even supposed to be fighting  you and he didn't use a lot of energy in that fight.  It's like, you might have a very ready to fight Tito.  I think so.  I think so.  I hope so.  I hope so.  I like that ready to fight Tito rather than the one who makes excuses after he loses.  I mean, that's what I want.  That's what I've been training for.  I've been training for to have a good fight.  I've been out for 14 months and if I can have a fight, that's a good fight and a good 
[02:45:30]  challenging fight, then that helps me out for my next few fights.  I don't want to go in there and have a really quick fight.  So then it feels like I've been out for 14 months still the next time I got a fight.  Why were you out?  You know, it was kind of crazy.  I was waiting for Shogun to get better because he was a title holder.  And after I beat Rampage at UFC 114, I was the number one contender.  And I was waiting for Shogun to get better because he had a knee surgery.  And then he got better and we were supposed to fight in March. 
[02:46:00]  And then I ended up blowing out my knee.  So then I had to wait and Jon Jones won the belt.  And then I had to wait my turn to find somebody to fight me.  Wow.  And it was fair to ask you, but to the winner of your fight, fights the winner of Rampage Jones.  Yeah, pretty much.  Which, you know, let's predict it's going to be you against Jones.  I want Jones just because from a fan standpoint, oh my God.  I like Rampage though.  He's a funny guy.  He's like a hard guy not to like. 
[02:46:30]  Yeah, Rampage is pretty funny, but I don't like him either.  Oh, really?  We like Rampage too.  What am I saying?  Yeah, yeah.  As a dude, I like him.  But why don't you like him?  I mean, you know, we fought each other and we did the show.  But usually I probably don't like him just because, you know, he talked a lot.  Yeah.  He got a lot to say and whenever we get around each other, we argue.  Have you seen the Ultimate Fighter show when we did?  I did not know.  Oh, we argued on it a whole time.  It was just like, I mean, it was fun arguing, but there's a couple of serious moments. 
[02:47:00]  But it was like two brothers just going at it every single day.  Like if he's seen me, then he always have something to say.  But he had like his crew with him.  So everything he said, they just laugh and everything he said.  So it was like they gang up on him.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, so I was like, okay, okay.  I was going to say, so either way, you're in a good position.  Yeah, I mean, you're a guy.  Yeah, I'll, you know.  Oh, God, that's, all right, get past Ortiz.  Yeah, yeah.  Do that.  You know, because we don't hate each other most of the time when we got to fight somebody.  It's usually just a phone call away, the UFC calls you and say you got to fight such and such. 
[02:47:30]  So it's not like any hate, you know.  But then sometimes you get a chance and it's a treat when you really don't like somebody.  Because then it's like, yes, I really don't like this person.  Was it satisfying to be at Rampage then, even more so because you don't like him?  Yeah, it was satisfying, you know, because I couldn't imagine losing to him.  If I would have lost to him, man, I don't know what my life would have been like right then  because he's the kind of person that wouldn't let it go.  You know, he would just keep talking about it all the time and it just would have been horrible.  Did you want to slap him in a club?  Yeah, we both slapped each other.  Oh, this guy from Ireland knows his shit then. 
[02:48:00]  Yeah, yeah, we both slapped each other.  It was, I seen him at this Machida fight.  I seen him at this Machida fight.  We're talking and I'm giving him a hard time like I always do  and he's giving me the same hard time back.  And he's like, he drunk as a skunk.  I mean, just like about to fall over the table drunk.  And I said something to him and I looked away and then he was like,  man, Rashad, Rashad, stop talking with me.  Rashad, don't say nothing to me.  Rashad, stop talking with me.  Don't say nothing to me.  And I was like, yeah, whatever.  And then he just like, he gave me like one of a playful slap on the face. 
[02:48:30]  And I was like, did this dude just slap me on the face?  And then afterwards I slapped him and then everybody jumped in like,  guys, guys, no fighting, no fighting.  And we're not going to club in Vegas.  And they're kind of like, they're kind of like leery of letting us fight us in  anyways because they know if we get into a fight,  it's going to be a hard time breaking it up.  Yeah, the bouncers want nothing to do with it.  Oh, hell no.  Start placing bets.  Yeah.  I saw Liddell one time playfully.  Him and Dane, I was at the Improv in L.A. and they came.  And Liddell, I think, had tipped a few back  because he was heckling during the show, which is horrifying. 
[02:49:00]  And this is on video.  And they were playing outside and he slapped Dana.  Kidding.  But Dana didn't freak out.  He's just like, hey, come on, man.  He was like, that's the way they joke around.  Chuck has heavy hands, too.  Chuck got heavy hands.  So he probably hurt.  That had to sting a little bit.  Yeah, yeah.  Had to hurt.  We got Don in Buffalo has something here.  Don.  Talking to Rashad Evans.  Yes.  Oh, big fan, big fan.  Hey, I just had a question.  I had a friend who owned a taco restaurant 
[02:49:30]  that was opening up way late in the downtown area of Buffalo.  And he claims that you walked in  and there was like two guys that was insulting the woman  and you stepped in and then they started talking shit to you  and you just, from what he said,  you just knocked them both out one punch.  Yeah, yeah, that happened.  Unless you're one of those guys that's trying to sue me.  Yeah, that happened, man. 
[02:50:00]  I got in a lot of fights back in the day  and it's great that I ended up being a fighter  because that way, you know, I stay out of jail  because every time I got in a street fight,  my mom would find out about it somehow  and then she'd be like,  Rashad, your ass can end up in jail.  And that's what I hear from her all the time.  Rashad, you're going to be in jail  because you keep on fighting in the streets,  you will be locked up, Rashad.  So why did you hit these two guys?  They were just, they were bothering the lady  and they wouldn't stop?  Yeah, it was late night  and they were like harassing this lady  and then, you know, this girl  and they were just like talking like disrespectful 
[02:50:30]  and kind of crazy  and then I said something to them  and then they started to get like, you know,  like ramble on me and try to...  Oh, man.  So then we just...  Were they big guys?  Probably a little bit.  I don't know.  I really can't remember.  I'm going to tell you that they were like six foot three.  They were better for the story.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Two giant guys.  Meanwhile, there were two guys in wheelchairs  that were in their 70s.  But, dude, I want that story about myself just once.  Just one...  I'm 43 years old.  I mean, I look younger.  But, I mean, I just want one time 
[02:51:00]  would love to have an I-knocked-one-guy-out story.  And you got a bunch of them.  Like, you know...  But when justifiable...  Those guys would be an assholes...  But to him, it's no big deal.  I know.  It's like breathing.  I know.  You envy that, don't you?  The reason God didn't give me that gift...  Is because you would abuse it.  Oh, horribly.  Fuck.  Like, I'd be like Jake LaMotta.  I'd fight other men, my wife, anybody.  I would just hit anybody I could get away with it.  So, yeah.  I guess there's a reason that...  It seems like, too, that the UFC guys are the nicest guys  of all the athletes. 
[02:51:30]  A little closer.  Jesus.  I love E-Rock's pictures.  They're point-blank pictures.  Yeah, it really is.  It's like he's just waiting for the fucking money shot.  He's right on me.  But UFC guys, for some reason, I don't know why,  but they're so much nicer.  You guys are so much nicer than all the other athletes  we interview.  Yeah, I don't know what it is.  You know, that's the same thing I come across, too,  because I'm thinking, like, I see another professional athlete,  and then they're not as cool as, like, the UFC guys.  And I'm like, man, these dudes are, like, you know,  stuck off, you know, think they're bigger than what they are. 
[02:52:00]  But, you know, UFC athletes are cool.  We're very approachable.  Yes.  You know, we take pictures, and we don't get bothered by it.  Relative to other sports, it's a fairly new sport.  So hopefully in years to come, you guys will all be pricks.  Yeah, you'll have time.  I think, you know, what happens is probably they start getting paid  a whole bunch of money.  Yeah, yeah, that's when the attitude starts kicking in.  Yeah, that's when the attitude starts kicking in.  But it also rolls downhill, though, because Dane is very fan-friendly, 
[02:52:30]  and it seems like if the boss is fan, it's just the attitude.  I watched you last time I saw you.  I think you were in Vegas at this last fight.  Right.  And you just would not stop taking pictures with people.  Like, you were trying to go somewhere, and they just,  Rashad, Rashad.  And I would have been like that if I hadn't already had a picture of him.  Jimmy was just mocking somebody asking Rashad for a picture,  going, hey, Rashad, Rashad.  Meanwhile, that would have been Jimmy.  This is what a phony I am.  Not only do I have a picture with Rashad, but you've never,  could you hand me that photo?  It's embarrassing how close we are.  I don't know who, I think Reed Harris might have, no, it's under there, Sam. 
[02:53:00]  Yeah, there you go.  But you've never seen a photo of fucking, how close up is that picture?  Oh, my God, it's like, let me see.  It's like a family portrait style.  Is it a glamour shot?  Oh, my God.  Glamour shots.  Our fucking heads couldn't be closer together.  That's so uncomfortable.  That's a picture a couple takes on a cruise.  It looks like, yeah, we got this on the boardwalk.  We sat in one of those little booths and took it.  Man, that is a close picture.  In front of an anchor or something.  Yeah, I don't know why it's like that close, but it's funny.  I am shit-talking other people for wanting photos. 
[02:53:30]  But it never ceases to amaze me.  The UFC guys are never saying no to the fans.  They never ignore the fans.  I think a lot of it has to do also with the UFC, to their credit.  What they do is like when we first started fighting for the organization,  they make sure that we do those appearances,  and that way it kind of gets you out of that hole like,  I don't want to take picture mode because they sit you in these booths  and you're taking pictures for a long time,  but then after a while you get to understand that that's what it is to be at a UFC event.  I know if I go to a UFC event, I'm going to stand and wait for everybody to go through the line 
[02:54:00]  and take pictures with everybody because that's what it is to be part of the organization.  I think it's helped it grow, too.  I was talking to somebody, and Dana and one of the fighters were just taking pictures.  It was after the fight, and I'm like, but that's why this sport,  besides it's fun to watch, but people just connect to the fighters immediately  because everyone you meet, it's like if you shake a politician's hand,  you're going to probably vote for that guy forever.  You take a picture with an athlete, and you're always going to support him.  I don't ever want to see Rampage lose because he was nice to me. 
[02:54:30]  Somebody's nice to you once, and now you've been nice to me,  so if you fight Rampage, I'll like you more.  But you do, really, Mars, do you want to ask anything?  Because Mars, obviously, he wears the UFC shirt, and he's a bit of an MMA guy.  He's a little, he's got some bumps.  He's banged himself up a little bit.  He used to be in shape.  Oh, shit.  Before he started working for us.  Yeah.  He's like the UFC fighter that's on an injury right now.  Yeah, you know, he's nursing.  Ah, whatever.  What do you got, Mars? 
[02:55:00]  How you doing, Rashad?  With Tito, man, you're going to stand up with him more than you would grapple?  You know, each fight is different, and each opponent is different.  So I'm going to have to go in there and see where Tito's at  and where he's trying to take the fight.  And obviously, I want to take it to probably the opposite place  where he wants to take it to.  So, you know, I know I'm faster than Tito.  I know I'm faster than Tito and stuff like that,  and I think I can strike a little bit harder.  So I'm going to try to see where that takes me.  But I don't want to come in a game, a fight with too much of a game plan, 
[02:55:30]  too much of a mindset of what needs to happen.  I need to just react a little bit more.  Let me apologize for Mars' unprofessional question.  He can't give you his game plan, Mars.  Rashad, exactly what are you going to do, move by move?  I apologize.  We expected more out of Mars.  What's your opening?  Anything else you'd like to ask him?  What's your weakness in case Tito's listening?  Do you have any injuries that you haven't reported  just so Tito can exploit them?  Rashad, this is the way it is.  Whatever I ask you, man, it's going to be the wrong thing.  It's going to be the wrong thing.  Well, let's try.  Let's see. 
[02:56:00]  You know more about fighting than we do.  Well, he seems like he's building up more to submissions  as opposed to before he was only ground and pound.  Do you think that Tito's getting better with the submissions,  and do you have to look out for, are you worried about his submission?  I think Tito, he's always been pretty good at submissions,  but I think it's now to the point where he's starting to believe in him  a little bit more.  And I'm not really worried too much about his groundwork.  I go with some of the guys that are the best in the world,  and I never really get submitted. 
[02:56:30]  So I'm not worried about Tito's submissions.  So let's get past Tito.  John Jones.  All right.  All right.  Damn, it's Mars' show.  I know.  Anthony just insulted Rashad.  I apologize again.  What the hell?  I'm implying that he can't get away from Tito's submissions.  Right, right.  He's just attacking our guest, and I don't like it.  I was about that, man.  I was like, is he even trying to say Tito's going to submit me?  The worst submission was that question.  Yeah, exactly.  So Rashad, Tito's obviously going to submit you.  How do you feel about that? 
[02:57:00]  Better get Mars' picture in the lobby.  What the fuck?  He just morphed into his radio show.  I didn't even know.  But no, no.  John Jones.  John Jones.  Yeah, yeah.  Probably no more than way.  That's good.  Well, let's say we get past Tito, and John Jones gets past, and you guys meet.  This guy is a problem.  He's so lanky.  His wrestling is really good.  He's fast, and his strikes are amazing because they come from all different angles.  That guy there, would you find yourself more in a grappling match as opposed to keeping him at an arm's distance? 
[02:57:30]  You know, I used to train with John, so I know exactly how to stroke that cat.  But it's just, I know John is adding new tools to his arsenal, but for the most part, you can't really change up what I've seen, you know, and what I know about him and how to compete against him.  But, you know, so, I mean, it all depends.  Like, when you fight somebody like John, he's so confident in a stand-up, it might be the best error to take him on a stand-up just because you might catch him slipping because of his arrogance in a stand-up. 
[02:58:00]  Do you know what impressed me about Jones watching?  I was, I mean, very, very surprised he beat Shogun.  All right, enough about Jones.  No, I'm just kidding.  That would be funny if he took out all his frustration on Mars and just knocked my teeth out.  It really would be a great ending to the show, and I wouldn't even argue.  But I was surprised that he used his knees very well, like, because he's got that lanky thing.  Like, when he would, it seemed like when Shogun would try to get in, his knees were very dangerous up in close. 
[02:58:30]  I'll tell you what, man, as much as I like to hate on John Jones, because I like to hate on John Jones, but the kid is good, man.  You can't deny what he brings to the sport.  The kid is amazing.  He's creative in there, and he's just doing what he wants to do out there.  And that's the part about John, I'm like, you know, I like that and I respect that because of the fact when he goes out there, he's a gamer.  He's on point, and he's just doing whatever he wants to do.  He does exactly what he does in a fight that he doesn't practice, and that's pretty rare because a lot of guys usually clinch up when they get into practice. 
[02:59:00]  But, you know, that's one thing that makes John good is that he's not afraid to try anything.  You know, he has the utmost belief in anything he tries, and he never second-guess it, and he just goes for it.  That's why he catches people with it because people are like, I know damn well he ain't going to try to do this, and then he doesn't.  He's just like, what the hell, you know?  So that's what makes John a tough person to fight.  Well, you're 15-1.  I mean, you've got quite an impressive record yourself.  I mean, I do all right, man, you know, but this ain't about me.  Wait, it is. 
[02:59:30]  He answered the John Jones surgery question already.  Is there a caller?  Yeah.  Well, let's see if he's just tuning in.  Did Mars say it's okay to take that call?  Is this all right, Mars?  Well, actually, I've got an observation, if you guys notice.  Thank you.  Look how bad Rashad is.  He's walking around New York City in flip-flops.  You know?  I've been in South Florida for the last, you know, few months, so this is the proper tie.  This is not proper tie for New York.  No, I'm just saying, everybody.  You got a problem with his flip-flops?  Yeah, what's wrong with his flip-flops? 
[03:00:00]  What are you saying?  What I'm saying is that people that...  I hope he knocks your teeth out.  That would be great.  By the way, he doesn't sue people.  Yes.  He's never sued anyone.  People that, like, you know, thugs walking around here, they walk with Tims, and they,  you know, meanwhile, you're a man that obviously can kick a lot of ass, and you're walking  around with flip-flops.  I like this look because it's less intimidating.  See, if I walk around with some Tims in a hoodie, then that might be a problem.  Can you make a flip-flop print on his forehead right now?  How great would that be if Mars had a half a shoe print on the side of his face for the 
[03:00:30]  rest of the day?  And it bruises, so it's there for a while.  It's been a half hour since he's been asleep.  You might as well put him back.  Damn, man.  In person, man.  Yeah, Mars is one of our engineers who just does a horrible job.  So we do love him.  He's a very good guy.  Oh, man.  And let me give the big plug, too, because we're...  Are you doing your thing, Jimmy, or no?  Oh, yeah, I would love to, but I want to give the plug, too, is the fight, which I'm  going to and hope he's going to is...  Absolutely.  Next weekend.  Next weekend.  UFC 133.  It is Rashad versus Tito Ortiz, and it's going to be a great fight, because I really think Tito 
[03:01:00]  is more dangerous now than he would have been, because he just came off training in a tremendous  fight.  And it seems like...  Because I don't think anybody was taking him seriously for a little while, and now this  is his shot.  He sees you probably as the one thing in his way.  So I imagine this is going to be a good fight.  And it's funny.  I was sitting behind Chuck Liddell when Tito fought, and I was like, wow, could you believe  that?  And he's like, yeah, I never saw him hurt anybody before.  It's really fun to watch those guys fucking shit-talk each other the way we do, the radio 
[03:01:30]  guys.  Yeah, Chuck hates Tito, man.  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  He can't...  I mean, he loathes Tito.  Tito really bad, man.  He doesn't like him.  But you know what?  I don't think nobody was more surprised in that arena than Tito Ortiz.  When Tito won, he didn't even know how to react to it.  He, like, forgot even how to celebrate for a second.  He was just like, oh, oh, oh, oh, I got hurt.  I got hurt.  It was like almost a question.  Dude, he was meant to say, I got hurt, but he was like, I got hurt.  I got hurt.  What is it with him? 
[03:02:00]  A lot of guys don't like him.  A lot of guys don't like Tito.  What is it?  I don't know, man.  He comes off a little douchey.  Yeah.  I don't know, man.  There's a lot that can be said, but...  Do you just think he's arrogant?  Is he a little arrogant?  You know what?  Honestly, personally, I don't got a problem with Tito, to be honest.  But, you know, some people say that he's kind of, like, arrogant, and he kind of, you know,  he's kind of got a...  He kind of acts like he's Hollywood, you know?  And that's the worst thing for a fighter.  Like, a fighter never wants to be Hollywood.  That's like, if, like, I would talk to one of my fighter friends, I'd text him, and they 
[03:02:30]  don't hit me back right away, I'm like, you Hollywood-ass punk.  And that's like fighting words, you know?  So people don't like that when they see another fighter and they act all Hollywood.  It's like, dude, this dude thinks he's better than what he is.  What do you think, what I normally do when the fighters come in, and I've done it with  a lot of fighters where they've done it, is I, because I really am in awe of watching  UFC, is they'll put me in some kind of a move very quickly, and it's very, I tap immediately.  It's not a test of two men.  It's like, you know, one little fella seeing what, like, a real fighter does. 
[03:03:00]  Yes.  And we've had everyone, you know, Brock has done it, and Fedor put me in an arm lock, and,  you know, so if you would put me in one, but again, I will tap quickly, and something  that's easy.  But I've had a bunch done.  And I've had, Brock put me in a knee, I think what's it called, a knee bar?  A knee bar?  Yeah.  Okay.  Which is very unpleasant.  And they give, like, you know, a small percentage of power.  Wow.  And Jim's like, ah!  Can you talk of it?  Oh, yeah.  And McCain guillotine choked me, and KOTOR rear naked choked me.  I mean, I've had a few, really. 
[03:03:30]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  But just for that half a second, or that second to feel that, it's like, how does anybody  sign up for this?  It amazes me.  So, you know what?  That's one thing, right before I fight, that's what I think, not right before I fight, but  probably, like, the day before I fight, I'm thinking, like, so this is really about to  go down.  Like, I'm really about to get in a cage and fight somebody, and I'm like, what the fuck  am I doing with my life, man?  You have those moments, right?  Oh, that's hysterical, man.  It's like, what am I doing?  Like, am I really about to go in there and fight somebody, and this is about to be cool, 
[03:04:00]  huh?  I'm like, everybody's okay with this.  I'm like, wow.  15 and 1, though, bro.  But you know their goal has been to hurt you, too.  Like, that's their goal, is to knock you out.  Yeah, it is.  It is.  That's the crazy thing about it, because sometimes you go into the fight, you're thinking, like,  there's only a few ways I'm going to get out of this.  You start thinking, you know, your mind starts playing trick, and you're just like, man, you  know, I just hope it's a good way.  Hope it is a good way.  The thing that is the most brutal for me when I'm watching this is that hammer fist. 
[03:04:30]  Holy shit.  I love that punch.  That's my favorite one.  Holy shit.  It's so unassuming.  A lot of people still, even though everybody uses it, it's still, like, something that surprises  people.  Like, when you hit somebody with a hammer fist, you're like.  Holy crap.  They almost look at you for a second like it's an illegal move, like.  Hey, come on.  Because it looks almost like a schoolyard beating when you see somebody getting a hammer fist.  It's just like, it looks just like just one guy.  Like, it looks like something you see in a schoolyard.  It looks really brutal.  Can you take a hammer fist, Jimmy, today?  No.  You know what you probably couldn't take? 
[03:05:00]  You couldn't take a foot stump.  A foot stump is, like, one of the most painful things, and it's, like, a thing that the fighters  just, it's, like, one of those things they agree to without even agreeing to it.  Like, it's like, okay, you don't do it to me, and I won't do it to you.  Oh, really?  Yeah, yeah.  Those are just bad.  Nobody does a foot stomp.  You know, everybody.  Should he take a foot stomp?  No.  He'll break your foot.  Yeah, yeah.  I've seen those guys in the clinch, and I've seen a lot of guys do it, and you just see  just trying to step on the guy's foot, and it lands, and it doesn't look like it hurts, 
[03:05:30]  but you know that it hurts a lot.  Well, my point exactly was him wearing flip-flops.  He knows that.  He's still got flip-flops on.  I still, it's a badass move.  I was like, it's a dare.  Like, I dare somebody to foot stomp me.  Fuck.  I would, yeah.  I would just make you angry.  Yeah, I don't take...  Those arms could probably take care of some business there.  Fuck the flip-flops.  I don't take strikes, and we had Anderson Silva, and he gave me a, I wanted a light kick  from Anderson, because again, you can't take too much, and he's such a nice guy.  He didn't really want to hurt me. 
[03:06:00]  Oh, I don't want to do this, but...  Yeah, and he has sunglasses.  He's a very nice man, and he kicked me a couple, really light.  I'm like, you can go a little bit, and he probably put less than 10% into it, but the  one time he did actually, where I kind of just, I had never been jostled like that,  and I had a headache for two hours.  I'm like, that fucking, he hurt me just kicking my shoulder gently.  So the fact that there are people that take that...  It was a solid kick.  I think you're downplaying a little bit.  But I mean, for him...  I think it was over more than 10%.  For him, though, it was...  No, he could have done a lot harder.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But it was, it was, he took a pretty, pretty good kick. 
[03:06:30]  How about, one more question before I, before I really probably get myself injured.  Chael Sonnen, are you, like, he's to me, kind of a guy I like to watch, because  he just seems to be kind of motherfucking everybody, which I'm sure is annoying  a lot of fighters.  Yeah, yeah, he just, he says what he wants, man, Chael, Chael is Chael, man.  I don't even engage with Chael with those, because it's like, it's like, I get, because  I like to talk trash, but if I start talking trash with Chael, then it's like, where does  it lead to?  Like, we probably won't fight.  Right, what is he, 185? 
[03:07:00]  Yeah, he's 85, and he probably won't fight, so it's like, what's the point?  But, man, he pisses a lot of people off.  Every, the Brazilians, they, they, I mean, he's like, in Brazil, he's like, wanted, like,  they would destroy him.  Do you think he would go fight there, or it would not be a smart move?  Worse than that, I think he's going to go there for UFC Brazil in a couple weeks.  Wow.  Yeah, I know, that takes a lot of balls, because I, you know, he said a lot of bad things  about the whole, the, the, the country.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And that, and I, and they are a very proud, proud race of people, and it's like, when you 
[03:07:30]  start talking about, you know, the country like that, they get pissed off, and he, he  said some things that he, you know, he shouldn't have said it.  I mean, he was, it's one thing to gasp a fight, but then it's another thing to start talking  about a whole nation, and then you got to worry about everybody from that nation.  Yeah.  So, he, he's definitely picked a fight with the, the Brazilian community that, uh, I don't  really understand if he even knows how bad he did, you know?  That's crazy.  Yeah, he was attacking their jiu-jitsu, but when you're, you're right, when you're attacking  the country, it's not just the fighters. 
[03:08:00]  Yeah.  So, you got to watch yourself when you go into the arena, because, uh, they don't fuck  around down there.  Yeah, and if you've ever seen, well, if you've ever seen soccer games, they really do kind  of pull together.  I'm telling you, man.  Oh, man.  They're crazy.  Yeah, they're definitely a strong community to get behind each other, and I'm like, he  doesn't understand, like, uh, one of my training partners is like, hey, bro, you  know, uh, you know, you know chess on it?  I'm like, yeah.  I want to fight him, bro.  I don't care.  I want to fight him.  He's like a 145 pounder, I'm like, man, he lived too little to fight, Chell, but they  don't care.  Like, they, they're just not feeling everything he's saying about the country, and this dude 
[03:08:30]  is going to go there for UFC Brazil, man, he might be in trouble.  He beat up Anderson Silva like that.  I mean, he lost the fight on a submission, but he, I couldn't believe what he did.  Man, he went after him.  He went after him, but I couldn't believe it either.  Like, like, the way he lost at the end, I just, I just could not believe that that even  happened like that.  And Rogan kept calling.  How good is Rogan?  Like, he's, he kept saying, he better watch out.  He's leaving his arm out.  He better watch out.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Every time Joe starts, I wish the fighters could actually hear Joe so they would stop  doing shit. 
[03:09:00]  That's funny you say that because, like, my mom one time said, Rashad, why don't you  listen to Joe Rogan?  Like, well, I can't hear Joe Rogan.  Fucking Joe Rogan, I can't hear him.  He sees it all, though, man.  He sees it before he comes.  I like your mom, man.  She sounds like a character.  She's trying to critique me based on what Joe Rogan said.  See, Rashad, you need to work on your guard passing.  You need to work on how to pass your guard.  And I'm like, mom, how do you even know something like that? 
[03:09:30]  Joe Rogan.  I think Joe Rogan's seeing the whole fight in slow motion.  That's why he's shringing it like this.  Oh, yeah.  He's got a pot lollipop.  Yeah.  Good old Joe.  Oh, yeah.  Good old Joe.  That's like his weed.  Well, a lot of people are suggesting stuff, Jimmy.  What kind of moves are they suggesting?  Can I suggest one?  Oh, yeah, sure.  This one would be easy enough for both of you.  They're all going to be easy for him.  Well, this one would be easy for you.  Arm triangle.  I was just thinking the same thing. 
[03:10:00]  There you go.  Arm triangle.  It's a good one.  It's a good one.  It's a good one.  Arm triangle.  Now, make him hear the fluorescent lights buzz.  Which, uh...  I'll do it on the side right here.  Okay, you'll do it on my right side.  Just don't hurt the right arm.  Believe me, that's the critical one.  And, um...  So, okay, I'll have my left hand to tap.  You can bet I will.  It won't hurt too bad.  Okay.  All right.  Hold on.  Let me tell him what...  Now, what he's doing right now is he's got his arm around my neck.  And he's got his head outside of my arm.  So, it's like a triangle.  My right arm and neck are being held by his right arm. 
[03:10:30]  And he's not hurting me.  But he certainly could.  Okay, so now I'm in the arm triangle.  So, so...  The noises you make, dude.  We need a montage of those noises.  Oh, we're going to have one.  That...  It starts off...  Like, it doesn't...  It's like, oh, this isn't that bad. 
[03:11:00]  And then the pressure comes.  And I didn't know the other hand came around.  It kind of pushed your head sideways.  Dude, your fucking head is being mushed my head like a tomato.  Where does it hurt?  In the neck?  It's not even necessarily a hurt.  It's just everything you know in the world is going away immediately.  You heard the sound he made.  It feels like that sound.  That's what it's like when it's having a boa constrictor on you.  Like, that's...  It is tight.  That's a tight one.  You're being squeezed.  There's nothing you're going to do. 
[03:11:30]  Jimmy, you'll picture that?  Great picture.  Look at his face.  Oh, my God.  That face says it all, man.  But look, the beautiful thing is, you can see my face.  It's from the back angle.  You see Rashad's hand about to hit my head.  I'm not even getting the hand on the head.  Not the full effect.  Wow, that is fucking powerful.  You got the sound, Travis?  Let's hear that.  Okay, so now I'm in the arm triangle, so...  Jimmy, my camera wasn't on. 
[03:12:00]  Can you do that again?  Those are the sounds of victory.  Can you take one more?  My camera wasn't on.  I'll take another one.  Because it was...  Because the only one...  Like, everyone releases it very quickly, I think, because these guys know.  But Fedor, because he only had my arm held on a little bit longer.  Like, I didn't realize what a Russian sadist is.  Because he's so quiet.  He's so polite.  Like, he's a good opponent.  But boy, when he gets your fucking arm, he doesn't...  Well, he doesn't understand English.  That was the problem that day.  I actually said...  Tap, tap, tap, tap.  I said the words tap.  And tapped him. 
[03:12:30]  In Russian.  Yeah.  He was the one that kept it on the longest?  A little bit longer, but that was okay.  Rashad could keep it on a little longer.  No, I don't want him to.  That hurts.  Will you do another one?  That's a tough one.  Sure, but you realize how easily these guys...  It's like, anyone who doesn't like this sport, it's fucking so impressive to me that  knowing that can happen, that somebody shows up.  Like, immediately, if someone did that to me in training, I would find a way to get out of the fight.  I'd be like, look, I can't do it.  I can't do this.  Yeah, I gotta go somewhere.  I want to get a nice close-up, so one more time.  Or what's another one you want to do? 
[03:13:00]  Well, you already had everything else.  I mean, everything else we have to get on the ground and do, so...  I would try something on the ground.  I've never had...  Something that's...  Because I know you have the fight coming up, so I don't want you to exert anything, but...  Oh, yeah.  How phony am I?  Yeah, you're really gonna hurt.  How phony am I?  Like, you know, I know you have a fight coming up, so now you don't want to fucking take this snail  and twist it up.  With your fluff-a-nutter body.  I know, how easy was it just to sink...  Even my head is soft.  Yeah, fuck it all.  I have a baby skull.  So what is...  I've never done one on the...  Even when BJ Penn armbarred me in the seat, and when Brock did the knee bar, it was in 
[03:13:30]  the chair.  What is one on the ground that's not...  You ever have a triangle?  I have not, no.  Is that the one that Verdum beat Fedor with?  Yes.  That is it.  Okay.  Because Verdum was on the ground, and Fedor started punching, and he was set up.  Yeah.  He was set up.  Oh, man.  Wow.  And that's when your whole body is kind of locked up like that.  It's kind of the same position, but just with the legs.  I would like to try that, because it tapped.  I am.  Fedor tapped.  See that?  That tapped Fedor.  It's like we're at a restaurant, and he wants to try everything on a menu. 
[03:14:00]  I would like to try that.  Well, you know what?  Fans never get a chance to do this.  Fans watch this stuff, and they never get a chance to do this stuff.  That's true.  To see what it's like to have a fucking champion fighter put you in a hold like this and know  you...  I don't have to do it in a bar.  And with a regular guy.  A regular guy.  Right.  This isn't another fighter.  This is the fan experience.  Because you're not doing it in a way...  There's a couple of guys in a fucking restaurant somewhere that know what it's like to be knocked  out by him.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Sure do.  I don't have to deal with that. 
[03:14:30]  So that's why.  Is that okay?  I would like to try that.  Oh, I'd like to see that.  Yeah.  This would be great.  What's this now?  Now I have to get a mic down here.  It's a triangle.  Is that mic on?  I don't know if I got that one on the leg.  You got this one?  He's on seven.  Set.  Okay.  Now Sean is laying on his back.  Come inside of my guard.  I'm inside.  I have to look closer.  Going in.  Yeah.  On my knees?  Yes.  On your knees.  He's lying on his back.  Now.  All right.  Now he's got him in like scissors.  He's got his scissors.  What do you call it?  So this leg...  So the lock down the lock is coming around Jim's neck. 
[03:15:00]  Yeah.  He's got everything all tied up.  And now he's got him in a triangle around his neck.  And now he's going to apply some pressure.  Oh.  Oh.  Jimmy's face is completely red.  He applied pressure.  He pretty much had him in a...  How was that?  In a leg lock around your neck.  I didn't know.  See that...  But now I know how that works.  Like I didn't realize the hips got pushed forward and applied so much more pressure.  Yeah.  Because you think that's all the pressure you're going to get. 
[03:15:30]  And then he pushed his hips forward and it's lights out.  Literally...  You would have just been gone, right?  A couple of seconds more of that and I'm out.  If you didn't tap, you're just gone.  And that's obviously not nearly, nearly your strength.  If you were in a real fight, I mean, how much more would you have...  Like what percent of that is what you'd give a real fighter?  Until they go to sleep.  But you would squeeze harder than that for a real fighter.  Yeah, yeah.  For sure.  Because they're going to try to buck out of it.  And instantly as hard as you can, right?  Yeah.  And what I would have also did, I would have pulled down on your head too. 
[03:16:00]  Oh, damn.  So you push the hips forward and the head gets pulled down.  Oh, man.  That would just knock you out.  Fuck that.  Get out of here.  That's very fucking...  But it's like, it doesn't, it's painful, but it's more, it's just pressure.  The pressure, you feel it in your carotid artery, you kind of get a little...  And how do you get out of that?  Like if somebody, if the opiate put the videos up, how do you get out of being so completely  engulfed by another person?  Well, in that position, what you would have had to do, you know the arm I had to go across 
[03:16:30]  my waist?  Yes.  You would have had to put that on the other side of my body.  And that would have gave you a little bit of room so you can, so your carotid artery doesn't  get cut off.  Jesus.  He's got to go.  And it's the same thing with the arm triangle, too.  They say you have to answer the phone.  So if you answer the phone like this, it kind of stops taking the pressure.  Oh, put your arm up by your ear.  Behind your head?  Like answer the phone, like you talk on the phone.  Oh, answer the phone.  Put your arm up by your...  Put your arm up by your ear, yeah.  Okay.  Because what you want to do is you want to get the pressure off your neck.  Right, right. 
[03:17:00]  Because that's causing you to feel that pain.  So...  Well, I probably wouldn't answer the phone.  I'd probably just fall asleep, let it ring.  They're saying Rashad is of the press.  Yeah, Rashad, this was a pleasure, man.  It was a pleasure, man.  You're great, man.  We're Team Evans all the way now.  Fuck that.  That's cool.  This next Saturday, next Saturday, it's UFC 133.  Rashad Evans against Tito Ortiz.  It's on pay-per-view, obviously, at 9 o'clock here on the East Coast.  And it's going to be a great fight.  And then the winner of that fight fights the winner of Jones' Rampage.  So I have a feeling we're going to see a Rashad Jones championship fight, which I think everybody 
[03:17:30]  wants to see.  Whoever it is, they're going to get it.  Oh, God, no.  That's something you just don't ever want to see.  Never, ever, ever.  And he's friendly.  I know.  He's friendly doing that.  That's hilarious, man.  Fuck that.  Well, it's been a fun...  I guess our show is done, too.  Yeah, yeah.  So we'll see you guys Monday.  Thanks, Rashad.  Come back and see us again, all right?  Rashad Evans, everyone.  Thank you.
