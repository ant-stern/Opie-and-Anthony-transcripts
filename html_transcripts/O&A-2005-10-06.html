<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show opened with a furious rant about Ron and Fez’s staff invading their office, leaving behind detritus like used dental floss and a matchbook belonging to a staffer named Harry.  This was followed by complaints about Hawk’s “faggy” strawberry Frappuccino order.  The show then transitioned to a live musical performance by guitarist Gary Hoey, who remained in the studio for much of the broadcast, providing musical interludes throughout.  Other guests announced or appearing throughout the broadcast included Carlos Mencia (“The Punisher”), and Susie Essman.  The hosts also promoted their “O&A Party Rock” novelty item and discussed the website undergear.com, Kelly Monaco's Playboy past, and listener-submitted jokes about Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes’ pregnancy announcement.  This speculation, along with the callers' contributions,  involved numerous sexually explicit and offensive jokes about Holmes' appearance and Cruise's sexuality, referencing specific movie scenes and employing crude humor.  Pictures of Mimi Rogers were also shown and discussed in a similarly vulgar manner.  This segment also included a “You Write the Joke” section dedicated to jokes (many sexually explicit and offensive) about Cruise and Holmes’ pregnancy.

A call from Al Jorgensen, lead singer of Ministry, followed, detailing his story of accidentally blowing up his tour bus with fireworks using explicit language.  Susie Essman then joined the show in studio.  The conversation shifted to her experiences, including her exhaustion from the previous night's Yankees game, her perspective on the Donald Trump roast, and her work on *Curb Your Enthusiasm*, touching on an upcoming episode featuring breasts and Jesus.  The discussion, frequently incorporating vulgar language, covered her personal life, relationships, and candid opinions on sexuality and show business.  The hosts and Essman engaged in sexually suggestive and offensive comments.

The show then included personal anecdotes from the hosts about women encountered in cheap hotels and motels, followed by Gary Hoey's experiences with the anxieties of flying. Carlos Mencia then joined the show.  A heated discussion ensued regarding accusations of joke theft, primarily focusing on a dispute with Joe Rogan.  Audio clips of Rogan were played, alleging that Mencia steals jokes and uses a stage name.  Mencia defended himself, discussing his name change and the origins of his material, offering to provide proof. The discussion encompassed Mencia's citizenship application process and his experiences with other comedians, particularly George Lopez, highlighting perceived animosity within the comedy community.  The argument also delved into Mencia’s alleged appropriation of a Bob Ross painting joke, initially shared with Adam Ferrara, later performed by Joey Cola on *Saturday Night Live*. Mencia denied giving the joke to Cola, claiming it was only the premise that was shared.  This devolved into a highly offensive exchange of insults, with Mencia using slurs and engaging in personal attacks against Opie and Anthony.  Many callers weighed in, often using offensive language and ethnic slurs.  Several unrelated tangents, including discussions about Joe Rogan's belief in giant apes, were also included.

Finally, Mencia discussed censorship on Comedy Central, specifically regarding his Hurricane Katrina jokes, using highly offensive and racially charged language to describe the situation and the behavior of some residents in New Orleans, and comparing it to his perceived greater preparedness for natural disasters in Southern California.  He detailed Comedy Central's refusal to air certain jokes, even innocuous phrases like "Cinco de Mayo", while allowing far more offensive terms to remain. The discussion extended to the frustrations of navigating television censorship versus satellite radio freedom, and briefly touched upon upcoming shows for Mencia and Adam Ferrar.  The show concluded with a musical outro by Gary Hoey.

[00:05:30]  Thank you very much. 
[00:06:00]  Gary Hoey. 
[00:06:30]  He's in the studio.  He's going to be jamming for us in a little while.  Also...  In the O in, ins and outs, ins and outs.  Also, the Punisher will be here around 9, 915.  And now we got to call him.  And now we got to call him out on that.  We got to call him out.  We got to call him out on the show.  What's going on?  Why don't they just say, 
[00:07:00]  and Carlos says that he kicks ass wherever he goes, 
[00:07:30]  and Rogan's the hack,  and Carlos says that people call him the Punisher,  like all the other comics and stuff.  You know comics.  They don't make up nicknames for other comics,  especially, like, flattering ones.  Okay, it's the Punisher.  I don't even want to go on after him.  You know, this guy's so good,  I'm going to be embarrassed getting up on stage.  We're going to get to the Bible.  I can't follow the Silver Surfer.  I've heard the Douchebag.  I've heard the Prick. 
[00:08:00]  I've heard things like that with you comics  throwing names back and forth for each other.  Never the Punisher.  The Hack.  Yeah, the Hack is a good one.  That's a good instant feedback.  Holy shit, fuckers.  Make it stop.  Make it stop.  We're just trying to wake people up today.  Yeah, that's our new thing every morning.  And they also call us the virus, the ONA virus.  We haven't explained that in a while.  It just gets under your skin, this whole radio show.  Jen from Seattle is an asshole. 
[00:08:30]  Mike.  They have begun.  It's like giving a gun to a baby.  That's right.  I like that.  That has to start every morning now.  Gee.  All right, where do we begin?  Well, I guess we've got to begin with  faggy drinks from Starbucks and dental floss.  Office hijinks, I think.  We're going to call it office hijinks?  Office hijinks, things that happened in the office  before we go to air.  We need music for that.  And one thing, yeah, sure, office hijinks. 
[00:09:00]  One thing was Hawk.  He got a beverage from Starbucks.  Now, that normally sounds like nothing.  Happens every day, doesn't it?  I don't know what the hell's going on with Starbucks.  I remember the days when you could just get coffee.  No, it's not like that anymore.  And every once in a while, they would give you an iced coffee.  It was either hot coffee or iced coffee.  That was pretty much it.  And if you were getting iced coffee,  whew, you were a rebel.  You were crazy.  You were crazy,  because everyone just wants that cup of joe in the morning.  And what did you order there, Hawk? 
[00:09:30]  I got a strawberry frappuccino.  Is that what you asked for?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  So you asked for the faggiest drinks from Starbucks.  Oh, my God.  The color, everything.  All of a sudden, the order from Starbucks comes in,  and there's like four or five normal beverages,  just regular coffee and iced coffee.  Bill, the intern, brought it,  so it was here in like 3.6 seconds.  Right.  Bill is an amazing, amazing worker.  He's like Chinese takeout.  Yep.  Well, when you smoke crystal meth,  when you first get up in the morning,  you can get a lot done.  Do you smoke crystal meth?  I don't know.  You just snort it.  Sorry. 
[00:10:00]  I guess I've never had crystal meth.  Well.  Just show everyone that.  It's like snorting a pin cushion.  Really hurts.  If you didn't get that.  All right.  So the beverages arrived from Starbucks,  and Eric's had the Q-top,  because they had an oversized bubble planetarium gumball machine dome thing  that they put on.  Because it has to be filled with sperm. 
[00:10:30]  There's so much goodness, it doesn't even fit in a cup.  So, yeah, that's to, you know, that's to cover up the whipped cream that they have to add to the top of the drink.  And a little cherry sauce, or a little cherry, there's something on top of that thing.  Oh, it's strawberry, probably.  It was more strawberry goodness.  Yeah, that's the first time they've done that.  Usually it's just the whipped cream on top.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Well, there's all kinds of strawberry goop in there over it.  They usually serve that drink in a tube with a rodent in it. 
[00:11:00]  It was a little shocking to see.  Everybody's just got their basic cups of coffee,  but you were there with this special...  You were actually having dessert at 6.45 in the morning,  is pretty much what that is.  It's dessert.  It's like getting a sundae.  His diet is fucked up.  Between all the mayonnaise and the frappies.  I've been good with the mayonnaise.  No, you haven't.  Yes, I have.  Stop it.  Every day you eat some kind of sandwich and there's mayo on it.  Is this true?  Yes.  Chicken salad has mayonnaise in it.  Chicken salad is horrible. 
[00:11:30]  You think it's good because it's chicken,  but there's so much mayo on there.  It's too much mayo for you.  What was your cholesterol last time you had it checked?  It was in the high 200s.  High 2s?  Cell.  Cell.  And you're still in your 20s, right?  Wow.  Holy crap.  You've got to wash that shit, bro.  It's like 250-something.  It'll bite you in the ass.  Come back and bite you.  250?  Yeah.  Nah.  Not far.  250?  Holy crap.  What's it supposed to be? 
[00:12:00]  Jesus.  I don't know.  A buck something would be nice.  A buck and change for your cholesterol?  Yeah, a buck and change.  And your temperature's what?  98?  It's supposed to be...  Anything under 2 is all right, you know?  But you're supposed to be down into mid-1s, things like that.  I'm pretty good.  I'm way lower than 150.  Where are you?  Way low.  Really?  Like 130.  130?  Something around there.  That's a good one.  Anywhere, 150 is good.  140.  You're going to get...  What do they make at Starbucks?  Do they have the Lipitor Frappuccino for you? 
[00:12:30]  Perhaps?  I love the Frappuccino and Rib Spreader.  And it kind of sucks because his faggy Starbucks drink took the attention away from Anthony,  who was destroying his area this morning.  I, um...  Well, you all know me.  Don't you?  First of all, when are we getting rid of everybody else?  Didn't they promise that in July?  They promised that all the cubicles...  Then they promised August, end of summer.  Sorry, Anthony.  Yeah, all the cubicles would be gone, and we would start construction of our real cool 
[00:13:00]  hangout club atmosphere broadcast center.  Stripper pole.  It's a place for bands to set up so people like Gary Hoey don't have to, you know, plug  into the PlayStation through the television.  Mars comes in and he's like, if you want to go from Gary to the TV, let me know.  I got to flip this and switch and...  Everybody tinfoil?  Yeah.  Yeah, so, you know, at some point we want everything gone, and we're going to have a  nice, cool club atmosphere out there. 
[00:13:30]  Cool.  It'll be a lot of fun.  It was supposed to happen already.  It was supposed to happen already, but instead we're, you know, we're squashed into a glass  office.  We got the glass office, which on the door...  Anthony and I gave up our private offices for Ron and Fez.  Yeah, we...  Assuming that they were going to take care of this whole mess.  So now we're all squished into the glass office, and it's getting a little too close for comfort.  A little tight, let's say.  Now, Ron and Fez have their own office. 
[00:14:00]  By the way, Eric Logan now says it'll happen early next year.  Really?  Oh, now it's early next year.  Well, it's already the end, you know, we're in the last quarter.  Yeah, but when they say that, how about let's start it late this year?  How about we start now?  Right.  We've been around long enough.  Even better.  We've been here over a year officially.  We've been around here long enough to know that everyone else in this space, in these  cubicles, absolutely do nothing.  They don't need that space.  What do they do?  Can we have some comfort level when we look people in the eyes at this place? 
[00:14:30]  Can we have just a little bit of space to get back to the office?  What the fuck do they do, though?  I was just starting to hit it off with our pal.  Which, who?  Who?  I don't even know their names.  Who?  Why is Big Kev have to be called the Oompa Loompa?  Why does Big Kev have to whisper the name of Buddy?  Buddy?  Who's Buddy?  I'm just hitting it off with Buddy now.  He runs Frank's Place?  Frank's Place.  Frank's Place runs itself.  No, but Buddy's cool.  He's a fan of the show.  It's dead guy music.  We chit-chat. 
[00:15:00]  And now, you know, you're making things uncomfortable.  I'm not saying get out because I don't enjoy some of the people that come in here.  I'm saying get out because we need a stripper pole and a stage.  I'm not.  And there's a great Lincoln Center facility that these people will be going to.  I'm not questioning if they're nice people.  I just know they don't do anything.  There's a choice between clothes people and clothes people.  Oh, my God, Opie.  You're out of here right on my heels.  How do you know what people are doing?  I'm hung around long enough to know they don't do shit.  Buddy's at his desk every day doing something on that computer. 
[00:15:30]  All right.  You've been here a year.  What does Buddy do?  He runs Frank's Place.  And what does that mean?  You got to run it.  By doing what?  Doing the job that takes what Buddy does to get Frank's music on Frank's Place.  It's a master computer.  It's a computer filled with music from dead guys.  All right.  Look, I don't know what he does.  All right.  Thank you.  At least I'm being honest.  I don't know.  But he's a nice enough guy.  What does the guy do that is like two cubicles over over there? 
[00:16:00]  Two straight up?  Yeah.  What does he do?  Oh, that's the Broadway thing.  Don't get me started.  Who wants a frappuccino?  Anyway, the point we're trying to make now, Elo's saying that it's going to be early next  year, which is like, what?  This was supposed to happen already.  This was promised to us.  One of the many things promised to us.  And I have, let me make this straight.  I have no problem with Ron and Fez.  I love the guys.  I love their show. 
[00:16:30]  Their friends always will be.  Have been for years.  Their staff, on the other hand, are fuckwads that are liars and thieves.  They are liars and thieves.  And they come into our office, even though it says no one, I don't know what the sign  says.  What does the sign say?  It says, Opie and Anthony personnel only in here.  Allowed.  Why are they using our office?  We already gave up one of our offices. 
[00:17:00]  I don't know.  They have, Ron and Fez have an office.  They should be able to use that.  Whatever computers they need in there.  Everything.  There shouldn't be a reason they have to come into our office.  If, by chance, there is something in our office that they need, they should make a phone  call or ask or something.  But it is run in there, pillage, and run out.  It's like that video.  I'm playing Rome.  That game Rome.  Oh, it's just like that. 
[00:17:30]  They run in, pillage the village, take what they can, and leave.  And then lie about it.  You motherfuckers.  Their staff are liars and thieves.  And this hasn't stopped.  We got a picture of Paul, one of their interns, on my computer.  Which, you know, basically wouldn't be a big deal.  But that's just the start of it.  Because then shit gets fucked up all over my desk.  And that was proven today.  Today, I sit down.  I'm trying to get online.  Oh, here it is. 
[00:18:00]  If you are not a member of the O&A staff, you should not be in this office.  Thank you.  So, I'm at the desk.  And I'm trying to use the computer.  Ope's coming up with fun, fascinating, sexy websites to go to.  I was just fucking with you guys.  Did you know that?  That was really funny.  Actually, I started off good, though, right?  You started off very good.  What's that chick's name?  Kelly Monaco.  Kelly Monaco.  Holy shit.  He goes, and put Kelly Monaco in the Google images.  I go, immediately, put Kelly Monaco into your Google. 
[00:18:30]  Hit pictures.  And Kelly Monaco is trying to hide her Playboy past.  She was on the cover of FHM recently.  Yeah.  And, oh, my God.  Hotness.  Just hotness.  The hotness ensues.  Yeah.  Really good.  So, we were checking out some fine, fine pictures of Kelly Monaco.  And then, where was the other?  Don't give it away.  Yeah.  And then, here you do.  Then the other site.  Talk about your dumb desk for a minute.  Yeah.  So, I'm sitting at the desk, and I've had problems now with the desk because Paul's using my computer. 
[00:19:00]  I don't like people using my computer.  It's not, you know, your basic standard issue office computer.  It's an alienware gaming monster.  And I don't want viruses in there slowing shit down.  God knows where he's going online.  God knows what wasteland of pornography this guy is logging on to and downloading all kinds  of cookies.  So, I really don't like people using my computer.  There's other computers that can be used besides mine. 
[00:19:30]  But we were dealing with that the other day.  And then, Harry, their other guy, their other guy.  And Harry is the bigger motherfucker.  Paul's just a big dumb oaf.  Harry is a lion sack of cunt.  He is a fucking asshole.  I cannot stand Harry.  I find a matchbook on my desk.  And there is a name and number in it.  The name is Harry, and the number is Harry's phone number. 
[00:20:00]  It's Harry's phone number in a matchbook on my desk.  Now, this normally wouldn't bother me, but I can't stand Harry.  And I'm wondering, why is Harry's name and number on my desk?  Obviously, someone's in there.  He didn't stand by the door, not come in the office, and lob it onto my desk.  He's doing something on my desk, digging through his pockets, pulls that out.  And God knows what sick reason he had for having a matchbook with his name and phone number on it.  Like, he's going to be slipping it to chicks.  He's got a whole box of matches waiting that he pre-signs, just in case any chicks want to fucking his name and number. 
[00:20:30]  Hey, you want to take an art test?  Here you go.  Yeah.  So, there's something going on.  Something going on with our office and my desk.  Because my desk is right by the door, so I guess it's convenient to just come and sit down.  So then, today, I'm going through some websites.  I got the newspapers up there.  And every day is a little more shit happening on my desk.  I'm guilty of it.  But you know something?  It's my fucking desk. 
[00:21:00]  If I want to stack crap up on it, that's fine.  I don't want other people's crap on my desk.  So, I sit down.  And I'm going through the website.  And I look over.  And there's a Starbucks cup on my desk.  And I go to pick it up.  And it's ice cold.  So, it wasn't somebody from our staff.  And it's three quarters full.  It's got the brown gook around the mouth little porthole that you suck out of the bung.  The bung hole that you suck out of. 
[00:21:30]  It's all drippy.  And sitting on my desk.  Some asshole just put it down there.  Like that's just a fucking bar.  The bartender will come in in the morning and clean it up.  That's me.  I'll put my apron on and clean up for everybody.  So, you know me.  You've known me over the years.  I take it.  I take it.  I take it.  I take it.  I lose my fucking mind.  That's it.  I'm on off.  I'm not a dimmer switch.  I'm off.  I'm off.  Everything's fine and dandy. 
[00:22:00]  Motherfucker, I'm throwing shit.  Bam!  That's how it happens.  So, I just start going.  What is all this shit on my desk?  And now it gets all thrown away.  Everything on my desk.  Whoosh!  Into the garbage.  And I felt bad because I had some open water that spilled on the floor.  And Nathaniel was all nervous.  No, no, no.  It was like when mommy and daddy are yelling and something spills.  And the kids run to pick it up and look up at the kids.  No, I'm going to call you out on something.  What?  Because some lovely listener sent us yellow roses.  Yeah, thank you.  In honor of our first year on XM's satellite radio. 
[00:22:30]  Yeah.  And you said the flowers were lovely, but something like they have to go too.  Because you were so annoyed at all the clutter on your desk.  So, I thought they were from Johnny Fontaine for getting them that part in the picture.  And I just said, take them away.  No?  Very good.  So, some lovely lady out there.  It was a woman, right?  Sent the flowers in because of all the lofts and lofts we've given her in the past year.  They're really nice.  They arrived, I guess, after the show yesterday. 
[00:23:00]  They were beautiful.  They were displayed nicely on your desk because the card was made out to you and Jim.  Beautiful.  And, yeah, they were perfect yellow roses.  And you said, I like the roses, but they have to go too.  She spent her hard-earned money and you threw them in the garbage.  And the water from the vase went all over the rug.  And the interns had to scatter and clean up the water for you.  Opie, you know when we're bombing Al-Qaeda and sometimes a school gets hit?  Yeah.  It's called collateral damage.  That's what happened with the flowers.  I'd like to make a statement. 
[00:23:30]  I never intended any harm to those flowers.  But in this war against assholes that are putting shit on my desk, sometimes the innocent will suffer.  And my sympathies go out.  And, by the way, a lot of people checking in already on the phones and the instant feedback calling you a workspace diva.  I am not a workspace diva.  Or a workplace diva, I think, would sound a little better.  I am absolutely not.  You better explain the one item you did find on your desk, which I think will bring everyone onto your side. 
[00:24:00]  Now here's what made me lose my mind even more.  Now I'm losing my mind anyway.  I'm throwing away.  I was throwing away everything on my desk.  Didn't care what it was.  There was a pile of sweatshirts, a hat, T-shirts that someone had put on my desk.  I don't know why they were there, whose they were.  The Opie and Anthony marketing plan?  Yeah.  Those all went in the garbage.  Everything went in the garbage off of my desk. 
[00:24:30]  Yeah.  Because I knew nothing on that desk except the computer and keyboard and mouse and joystick were important to me.  Everything else was garbage and it went in the garbage.  So I pick up some of the garbage and throw it in the desk and I look and to my horror, to my horror, just to the left of my keyboard, is one of those flossing sticks.  You ever see these things?  They're plastic, single-use floss, dental floss stuff. 
[00:25:00]  It's strung like a one-stringed harp and you take it and you put it between your teeth and you floss.  That used sitting on my desk next to my keyboard.  Some motherfucking dental hygienically good guy.  Good guy?  Well, he was...  You should have used the word challenge.  No, he's actually pretty good then. 
[00:25:30]  Who's got good teeth around here?  He's the culprit.  Well, whoever it is.  And none of our staff...  Well, we know it's not Eric.  Oh, look at how nasty Eric answered you.  You know that old gag?  No, I asked our staff...  That'll just make us try harder.  You know that, Eric.  All right.  No one on our staff fessed up to it.  And since our staff are not full of thieves and liars, I believe them, since Ron and Fez's  staff has been proven to be thieves and liars, put that page down. 
[00:26:00]  We'll get to one of the websites you maybe go to.  All right, we'll get to that in a second.  After that sexy chick, you make me go there, ass.  And I am blaming it on one of their staff because they have been proven to be people that  come into our office and do things, use things, steal things, and use things they're not  supposed to use.  And this will not end right here with this show either.  The Wicklands coming in?  When? 
[00:26:30]  Yeah, we're going to get some guys fired.  Yep.  That's what's happening.  It's pretty obvious.  We need to fire some people and that will go down.  I know through Ron and Fez that Wicklands is supposed to come in Friday and there's some  shit going down there.  I am going over Wiki's head.  I'm saying it right now.  Elo, Eric Logan is getting a call from me and he never gets a call from me.  Getting a call.  I want this shit sorted out.  I want heads to roll.  Because I'm sick of this.  There was another thing that happened. 
[00:27:00]  Someone went through...  Yeah, and this is bigger than my personal diva-ness.  Someone went through Ben's Rolodex.  Someone.  Let's just say who the fuck it was.  Fuck dick asshole Harry.  Oh, I didn't know that.  That idiot.  Again, he comes in.  Now, apparently Danny was witness to this whole thing.  Danny.  Danny.  We deal with the facts on this program.  Right.  Facts.  What did Danny say?  Well, just that.  All right.  Thank you, Danny. 
[00:27:30]  Yes, Harry.  Harry walks into our office.  Er, just doesn't even like, you know, ask if this is cool.  Should I, hey, should I call this person and find out?  Just decides that, you know, it wouldn't be a problem at all to just start flipping through Ben's Rolodex.  Ben's personal show Rolodex.  Now, this is stuff that has numbers to our guests in it.  Guests of the radio show, which, by the way, are very coveted by radio shows.  Those are relationships that you've built up over the years that you want to keep, some of them exclusive. 
[00:28:00]  You don't want thieves from other programs pilfering not only your change from your desk and your computer time, but guests from your show.  And I don't know if he was going for that or what he was going for, what number it was.  But just the fact that you go into Ben's personal Rolodex, pulls out one of the cards, leaves the office, goes to the copy machine, comes back, and pops it back in the Rolodex.  Now, we have no clue what it is, but we will find out today and get to the bottom of whose name and number he's thieving without calling Ben and saying, 
[00:28:30]  I'm going through your personal phone book here, your Rolodex.  Well, let's call Harry right now and get to the bottom of it.  Oh, what's his number?  Oh.  Yeah, everyone's got it.  I know Ronnie gave it out over the air.  Harry's not qualified to do the job for Ron and Fez.  Nope, he's proven himself to be inept.  And I think he's in a major panic at this point, and now he's desperate, and he's going to go through our shit and our Rolodex and hang out in our office and find little nuggets and things he can bring to the Ron and Fez show. 
[00:29:00]  Yeah.  And that will be his demise now.  That will be his demise.  Again, I want to make clear, I have no problem with Ron and Fez.  Love those guys.  Oh, yeah, we're not.  We're not.  Love those guys.  We're not saying anything about Ron and Fez.  It's their shit staff that they have working with.  They deserve better.  They deserve a better behind-the-team staff.  And God bless, they do have one guy on there.  I don't know his name.  I don't know our own intern's name.  They do have one guy that does seem to be stepping up and doing a good job. 
[00:29:30]  And Earl is.  And they're happy with him.  And Earl has been unbelievable.  Earl's been the MVP, I'm hearing.  As the producer of the Ron and Fez show, he's good on Mike.  And they've been commenting on the fact of how good he is on Mike.  They ask him a question, he's not like, oh, I don't want to talk.  Just, fuck you.  He's very happy now.  Everyone comes here, and they get happy.  And I was all happy until their asshole staff came in.  Right, and there's the dental floss on your desk.  Oh, you put it up on Foundry?  Yeah, there it is.  You have no problems, usually. 
[00:30:00]  You know how sick I get with people's disgust?  There's somebody's dental floss on my desk where I eat, where me and my wife sleep,  where my children come to play with their toys.  That's right.  That's right, Anthony.  That's right.  All right, here's the deal.  Don't give away this website, because I want to...  Oh, I want it all kept for myself.  I want to give a little treat out to everybody out there.  So what I'm going to do is I'm going to give out a website for everybody to check out. 
[00:30:30]  Are they laughing at me?  No.  What are they laughing at?  I don't know.  There's fun and hijink.  The door open, and everyone's just laughing.  Eric, ask what they're laughing about, because I'm setting up something here.  And I don't want, you know.  They're just laughing at Poe, maybe?  Huh?  Oh, no.  What?  What was that?  One of the interns was singing Elvis, and Poe thought it was really funny. 
[00:31:00]  Holy shit.  Oh, my God.  Oh, is that great?  People are asking, why don't you lock the door to the office?  Why doesn't the office door get locked when we leave?  It is because our staff is working diligently for the next day's program.  They're here.  So they're in and out of the office.  Most of the day.  Most of the day.  And a lot of times they're not in the office, but they're here.  And it would be a pain in the ass to have to lock the door every time you leave the office  to go to the production studio or something, and then go back into the office and unlock it again. 
[00:31:30]  All right.  Here's the deal.  I'm going to give out a website.  I want the listeners to enjoy this website.  And then we'll go right to the phones after the break to see what they think of the website.  Okay?  I gave Anthony the Kelly Monaco thing.  Yeah, which is so hot.  Pop her name into Google Images.  And Adam goes, let's see picture number two.  And what did Anthony say?  We've already been there.  We've already been there.  We already saw that one. 
[00:32:00]  You never backtrack.  When you're on a limited time basis and you have a lot of naked pictures to look through,  you don't backtrack.  Okay, but I wasn't there for the first viewing.  Your problem.  No, I was sitting there getting ready for the show.  I was sitting.  I was flossing.  Adam, and way to make it sound sexy.  Go back to the one where it looks like she's taking a shit.  Yes.  Go back to that one.  Yeah, she's kind of squatting and pushing her tits together with her biceps.  And it was a hot shot, but we had moved on. 
[00:32:30]  It had been filed in my spank bubble.  I was still taking it in.  And then we moved on to another fine website called undergear.com.  Undergear.com.  Everybody go to undergear.com and check it out.  Check it out, boys.  And with that, we should get some music from Gary Hoey.  What's up, Gary?  Hey, buddy.  How you guys doing?  I don't know if you're plugged in.  I have no idea.  I know we haven't done a sound check, but, you know, let's see if we can get any guitar 
[00:33:00]  coming up here.  I don't know if there's anything going on.  Let me see.  I don't know if that sounds good.  Sounds good.  And one kind of headphone.  One headphone.  We got one headphone working.  Oh, boy.  That's not too bad since we never even did a sound check.  At least we got half of it.  We got half a Hoey.  All right.  We got half a Hoey.  He's got to screw with the PlayStation.  Oh.  Is that the other one?  Yep.  We got a nice squeal.  I got two now.  We got two?  You got two?  Yeah.  Yeah.  What is that nice squeal? 
[00:33:30]  What is that?  Uh-oh.  What is that squeal?  That's good.  I think it's like a Hendrix. 
[00:34:00]  That's good.  What is that?  ¶¶ 
[00:34:30]  Oh, my God. 
[00:35:00]  Oh, my God. 
[00:35:30]  Oh, my God. 
[00:36:00]  Oh, my God. 
[00:36:30]  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  All right, Gary.  We'll get to you in a second.  So, I guess a lot of the fine listeners are going to undergear.com.  Undergear.  That should have remained in the secret room.  Hey, you tools, why the fuck did you send me to a man's underwear site?  You suck.  What's up with all the banana hammocks?  You shit dicks. 
[00:37:00]  Curse you.  What the fuck are you doing, you assholes?  Oh, my God.  Oh, my fucking God, Opie.  Curse you.  Thanks a lot, Opie.  I feel gay for just having typed that website into my computer.  Opie, undergear.com is for faggots.  Gee.  Garbage dick from Wack Bag.  What's up with all the banana hammocks?  Yeah, that's a good one.  Hey, man.  It was in our paper today, and we figured we shouldn't be the only ones suffering.  Yeah, what was that in the post of the Daily News?  Yeah, Daily News. 
[00:37:30]  Daily News.  Where is that?  Where is the thing again?  It's like Big Boy Undies.  Oh, yeah.  That was the title.  Well, they do a section in the Daily News, I guess on Thursdays, called In the Know.  It's stuff that I guess we should know about, or maybe we didn't know about, but now we  know about.  I don't know.  I'm sure it's for that, and not just you look at it and go, no!  There's a guy in underpants that we all used to wear when we were maybe three, maybe two.  Never wore them.  You didn't have underwear like that when you were two? 
[00:38:00]  With flowers on it?  No.  This doesn't have flowers.  It has little pajama liner.  I had like Speed Racer.  I had Speed Racer.  It has little, it has a fire truck.  Oh, then it's fine.  And a fireman's helmet.  Oh, all right.  Well, that's much better.  That's not a fireman's helmet printed on it.  And a fire extinguisher.  There's only one.  That's not a hose.  So the guy's wearing the underpants that your two or three-year-old might be wearing right  now.  Yeah.  But he's like that.  He's the guy. 
[00:38:30]  If he was in the load company of Les Mis.  It says Big Boy Underpants.  Remember those adorable underoos your brother used to wear?  Somewhere along the line, guys stopped wearing their cartoons under their pants and gave  in to plaid.  Now they can revert back to childhood.  Yeah, that's what we want to do.  Undergear offers retro-inspired men's underwear that's cute but in a grown-up way.  What?  Which may inspire you to play grown-up games.  Dude, what chick is taking you seriously if all of a sudden they take your jeans off 
[00:39:00]  and that's what you're sporting?  You're wearing that.  Do you really think a chick is going to see that underwear?  Well, I guess.  That's for your Frappetrino drinkers right there.  Grant Wyman here from Dairy Mart saying, my computer needs a robe, is what he said after  popping up that wonderful site under gear.  But we were laughing pretty hard.  And Jimmy Norton checking in from Los Angeles. 
[00:39:30]  Hey, boys, love the site.  I don't think that's really Jimmy.  All right, well, there you have it.  Put in his real email address and everything.  Kelly Monaco.  Yeah, that'll wash it off.  That'll cleanse the palate.  That'll cleanse the gang.  Oh, my God.  Look at the picture.  There you go.  Popped up there.  There you go.  Kelly Monaco, M-O-N-A-C-O.  Hit images on the Google.  And you'll see some fine, fine pictures. 
[00:40:00]  She's on a beach wearing two strands of beads.  What show is she on?  Is she on that dance show or something?  She's on something.  And she's trying to, you know, avoid the fact that she was in Playboy and all that.  Oh, yeah.  That she's more mainstream.  But the pictures, thanks to the internet, are still all over the place.  General Hospital, 1963.  She must have played an infant.  No, that's just when the show started.  Oh, is that how they do that?  Yeah.  Oh, okay, okay.  All right, yeah.  Who did she play in General Hospital? 
[00:40:30]  Oh, she's a soap star.  Samantha McCall.  That was way after my time.  Why are you asking that?  With that show.  You watched General Hospital?  I used to watch it in about, eh, 83, 84, the whole, you know, during the Luke and Laura  phase, Opie.  That's when I was watching Jen Ho.  And you were under roots.  Oh, Dancing with the Stars.  Okay, she's on Dancing with the Stars.  Those were the dark years for me, Opie.  That was, um, I was getting older, but still wanted to lead the life of a child. 
[00:41:00]  So I didn't have a job, but I didn't have money, and I was living with various friends  in their houses and stuff.  And you guys all had your underoos on?  And, yeah, underoos, of course.  And sat around and watched General Hospital.  Of course you had to watch General Hospital.  My job, to actually earn my keep in one of my friend's houses, I had to clean up.  I had to, like, be the maid.  I was the maid of the house.  And I would stop and watch General Hospital in the afternoon.  It's the dark years.  I'll do the laundry after my storage. 
[00:41:30]  Yeah.  My programs are coming up.  Leave me alone.  The very dark years.  Yes.  All right.  Gary Hoey, what do you got going on, man?  Well, I just got a new CD out called Monster Surf.  We just put out over the summer.  We did a remake of a lot of old, just classic surf songs and good summertime stuff.  Yeah.  Went out touring like crazy all over the country and having some fun, man.  Heading to Asia on Tuesday.  Asia?  Yeah.  Heading to China and a few other places like Taiwan. 
[00:42:00]  And you're just going to play over there?  Yeah, man.  They're crazy over American rock and roll.  Really?  It's still going strong over there.  Man, we played in Indonesia.  We played, like, the World Trade Center.  It was sold out.  We've been just doing great over there.  I've been going for about three years now.  Is that where it is now?  Indonesia?  Yeah.  They have their own.  Yeah, it's crazy over there.  But, yeah, we're heading over there.  And then we're going to be back and doing the fall, you know, the Christmas tour coming  up.  The Ho Ho Hoey.  We'll be back for the Christmas thing.  Ho Ho Hoey, of course. 
[00:42:30]  Gary Hoey.  We remember, uh...  Gary Hoey's going to come in and do Ho Ho Hoey.  Our old promotions guy.  Where's Ben?  Ben loves the Roger stories.  Yeah.  Roger.  And we have Gary Hoey coming in.  Ho Ho Hoey.  Gary Hoey will be doing Ho Ho Hoey.  Yeah.  So, yeah.  Things are going good, man.  I left L.A. about a year ago.  Probably just about the time you guys went on the air, man.  I split from L.A. and came back to the East Coast.  Yeah.  Living in the country.  Loving it.  Up in New Hampshire. 
[00:43:00]  From L.A. to New Hampshire.  That's a big adjustment.  That's kind of a jump.  Well, I spent 17 years out there, so it was enough for me, man.  Did you have to leave?  Oh, I had to go.  Well, I have two kids, and it was just not a place to raise kids.  No, huh?  When I was single, it was a lot of fun.  Yeah, yeah.  You know?  So you're raising kids and, what, teaching them how to get syrup from a tree?  Yeah, pretty.  I don't know what else they do up there.  You know, you're just walking in the woods, man.  They go walking in the woods.  We play around. 
[00:43:30]  We live on a cul-de-sac.  There's only four houses.  We have two acres of land.  I mean, it's unbelievable.  Nice.  And then I go on the road, and I rock the world, and I come home and get sap out of trees.  It's a nice change, you know?  Do a little snowboarding and all that up there?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  We've been skiing, snowing, snowboarding.  Matter of fact, my son, he was born in California, so he asked me to make a halfpipe out of snow in the front yard.  So last Christmas, we did a halfpipe out of snow.  Now, did you ever do any surfing out in California?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Well, I scored...  Not much surfing in Vermont, though. 
[00:44:00]  There's not.  No.  I scored in the summer, too, a classic surf film, well, 10 years ago, and I got to hang  out with, like, Kelly Slater and all the pro surfers, so they taught me how to surf.  I taught them how to play guitar.  All right.  That's pretty cool.  I'm not a great surfer.  That's a nice trade-off.  But it's fun.  Yeah.  They're probably not great guitarists, either.  Yeah, exactly.  It was a trade-off.  Yeah.  There you go.  Well, very cool to have you here today, man.  It's good to be back.  You want to play us at the break or something?  Yeah.  I was thinking we're having...  This is off a new CD.  We're having so much fun.  I thought we'd do fun, fun, fun.  All right.  Fun, fun, fun. 
[00:44:30]  Here we go.  Like Gary Hoey.  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!

[00:46:30]  guitar solo 
[00:47:00]  Come on, Gary Hoey live in studio today. 
[00:47:30]  That is great.  Not too shabby.  Thank you, thank you.  More with Adam Farrar, Gary Hoey on the way.  We got Carlos Mencia coming in.  Hey, The Punisher.  The Punisher.  And, oh wow, Susie Essman's coming in too from Curb Your Enthusiasm.  We'll continue in just a bit.  Hey, what's that?  You've never seen it before?  Looks like a rock.  New from Sedentary Toys and The Opie and Anthony Show.  Oh, it's so shiny.  It's got corners.  It's the cool new toy that has everyone jumping for joy. 
[00:48:00]  O&A Party Rock!  It's not just any rock.  It's the O&A Party Rock!  The O&A Party Rock is incredibly versatile.  You can chuck it.  You can buck it.  You can drop it in a bucket.  You can race it.  You can chase it.  You can yell right in its face.  It's the bestest friend you'll ever have.  O&A Party Rock!  Why is it wearing a party hat?  Every Party Rock comes dressed in a colorful party hat and party blower,  making it the centerpiece of any party.  Now with shiny red dancing shoes.  Not only that, the O&A Party Rock is...  is... 
[00:48:30]  is...  is...  It's a fucking rock, you dildo.  a little bit on the 
[00:49:00]  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony program.  Rock.  Gary Hoey in studio today, taking us in and out of break. 
[00:49:30]  Go ahead and floss, Dano.  And we found out that Gary's going to Asia.  Gary Hoey's going to Asia.  Really?  I'm going to be at Montclair Rascals tonight.  Are you, Adam?  Oh, yes.  And there's a lot of Asians there, I heard.  Yes.  Well, someone on the instant feedback.  It looks like Kevin from Westfield, Mass.  He goes, hey, Gary, you might want to tone down the surf songs when you're playing Indonesia. 
[00:50:00]  That's funny.  Yeah, this song scares the shit out of him.  That's why we have the greatest listeners in the world, man.  A lot of comedy writers out there.  Let's say hi to Chainsaw, the trucker.  Chainsaw, what's up?  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey, Chainsaw.  Yeah, I just wanted to let you guys know, I have no fear,  Playboy will not allow Kelly Monaco's dark past to go unnoticed.  They're going to publish some unpublished photos from this April 1997 in this November's issue. 
[00:50:30]  Just to remind all the...  Oh, the pics that weren't good enough?  Yeah.  Well, she wants to ignore her past, but Playboy's like, no way, man.  No way.  You're a hot item right now.  We got pics.  So, all right.  Good.  The December issue of Playboy.  We'll have some Kelly Monaco.  No, no, no, no, no, man.  November's issue.  Oh, November.  That's got to be out.  That's got to be out, man.  Probably out last month. 
[00:51:00]  Yeah, that was out in March.  Some odd thing about those magazines, you know?  All right, now I'm all confused, because November is like two months ago in the Playboy world.  Right.  Well, yeah.  I mean, I just got mine shipped to me last week.  I just got November, so it'll go on.  Where the hell do you live?  Arkansas?  Yeah, come on.  No fucking El Paso, Texas.  All right.  Thank you, Chainsaw.  El Paso City.  All right, bye.  Well, we should get into some news, because there's a lot of big things happening.  Oh, there's the, she's taking a dump picture for you, Adam. 
[00:51:30]  There it is, Adam.  What you wanted to look at.  There you go.  The one you rudely interrupted me for.  How long was I?  There you go.  It all is glory.  How dare I want to look at that, and we can go to bigboyunderwear.com.  It wasn't big boy, whatever it is.  It was undergeared.  Underoos and cock.  And there's some emails coming in from a gay guy saying, he goes, we gay guys have known  about undergear for years.  Well, there you go.  Okay. 
[00:52:00]  Enjoy.  It made it to the breeders today.  Well, here's the top story.  The breeders.  The paper's great, too.  Mission Impossible.  Oh, yeah.  Ah.  What are they hinting at?  What are they hinting at?  I love the New York Post.  What are they hinting at?  They don't want to come out and say it, so they just hint.  Mission Impossible.  Tom and Katie's baby joy.  Yeah.  It seems Tom has impregnated her. 
[00:52:30]  Right through his underoos.  Did he?  You think?  Or is it artificial?  He's got two adopted kids, right?  Yes.  Yes.  Why did he adopt?  Who was barren?  He didn't want to lose his figure.  Big Kev knows a lot of the celebrity shit.  Because Nicole Kidman didn't want to ruin her body.  Didn't want to ruin her body is why.  Well, that's a good reason.  That's bullshit.  Really?  Because they could have at least taken her eggs.  I'm thinking if you're a woman, you don't want to ruin your body.  At least you want the kids to have... 
[00:53:00]  Your genes.  Your genes.  I think there's a lot more...  Technology is pretty cool out there these days.  You pop the eggs out and throw them in somewhere else and voila.  There's a lot more to getting those eggs than you've led to believe.  It ain't like a guy giving a sperm sample.  How hard can it be?  That's like surgery for a woman.  They advertise in movie theaters for women to donate their eggs.  Yeah, but it's not like an easy thing.  Yeah, it is.  You just get a strainer.  No.  It's not a strainer.  The egg is spent at that point. 
[00:53:30]  It's spent.  You can't just once a month put a spaghetti colander underneath her.  Oh, you've got to be like one of those grape pickers?  And go looking through it.  One of those grape pickers at the vineyard?  There you go, like a grape picker.  You have to pick it off the vine?  They've got to go deep.  They've got to do some cutting.  I thought you just needed a strainer.  No, I think once it comes out and starts fiddling around in the fallopian tube,  there could be a problem with just gathering it up. 
[00:54:00]  They've got to get it right off the vine.  Right off the vine, okay.  And, well, that's probably why she didn't want to do that either.  No offense to Big Kev's info, but I'm thinking, you know,  if you're producing the eggs, then you're going to make a kid somehow with your own shit.  She didn't want to ruin the body either by having a baby, I guess,  or by going to the hospital and having to pack an egg out.  Of course we won't.  That's one of the questions I'm going to ask God. 
[00:54:30]  Now, what about...  We all have those questions for God.  What about the other girls he's been with?  Mimi Rogers.  Mimi Rogers.  He was married to Mimi.  What about Mimi?  Nothing?  Kev, no?  Nope.  Mimi Rogers he didn't have a baby with?  Where's the problem there?  What about the other one?  Penelope Cruz.  Wasn't married to her, but he was with her for a while.  Were they using the condoms?  I don't know.  Or the absolutely no sex because he's gay.  We don't know what. 
[00:55:00]  I don't know.  I'm just saying that's an option.  We don't know what he is.  Yeah, all right.  That old gag.  And neither does the Post, because by putting Mission Impossible,  they're saying it's impossible that this guy impregnated this hot gag.  We all know that's what they mean.  That's basically what they're trying to say, right?  Mission Impossible.  How did his gay penis get into her and impregnate her?  Right.  No, apparently they're very in love.  Should we play Write the Joke today? 
[00:55:30]  Right.  Because we do have great listeners out there with comedic skills.  Mm-hmm.  You know, this is the big story.  Tom and Katie having a baby.  Write the joke.  What's the joke?  David Letterman and Jay Leno last night both had the exact same joke.  Did they?  Okay.  But I think we can do even better.  What was the joke?  They said, well, you know, I'm not a stand-up show, but basically,  hey, did you hear Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes are going to have a baby?  Ah, applause, applause, applause, applause. 
[00:56:00]  Yeah, I guess that the Oprah couch wasn't the only thing he was bouncing up and down on.  Ah, they were having sex.  And they both had the exact same joke last night, Leno and Letterman.  I think our listeners could come up with a better joke as far as this Tom and Katie thing goes.  The baby would be Holmes' first child, Cruise's first biological child.  He already has two kids.  Connor, little Connor, 10, and Isabella, 12, with his ex-wife, Nicole Kidman. 
[00:56:30]  Holmes' lawyer dad, Marty, and homemaker mom, Kathy, did not return calls for comment.  As they are sedated.  Oh, boy.  But earlier this year, her uncle, Fritz Holmes, admitted that the family wasn't happy about Katie's involvement,  with the Scientology following star reportedly telling a friend, quote,  I think Tom seems like a real jerk.  I give it 60 days. 
[00:57:00]  All right.  That's the over-under.  Let's go to Chicago.  Kevin?  Yeah.  Hey.  How you doing, guys?  What's up?  Very good.  How you doing, Anthony?  I just wanted to let you know that my daughter and some of her friends have actually had their eggs removed.  They've actually donated them.  How do they do that?  It's just a simple procedure.  It goes about six weeks.  You get some hormone injections.  They actually inject themselves with hormones.  They go into an office, and they just take a syringe type of device, go in right through the wall of the uterus, 
[00:57:30]  and extract the eggs, and they make about five grand.  Yikes.  Five large per egg?  No, just for the whole thing.  Oh, for the whole procedure?  Yeah, and they get several eggs out of it.  So it can be done.  It's not that big a deal.  No, dude, what you just said sounds like a big deal.  Hormone shots for six weeks, and then a syringe through your belly. 
[00:58:00]  How come that's not a big thing?  But the same thing used to be the rabies cure, remember that?  You've got to get needles in your stomach, and that was a nightmare.  But you, it's like, no, it's no big deal.  You know why?  Because you don't have ovaries, my friend.  How about you take some hormones, and then we'll stick a syringe into your testicles for a while,  and see how you come back and say how that was easy.  Yeah, I will.  I'll tell you this.  I had a vasectomy.  That was a lot of fun.  Vasectomy.  That was a good time.  All right.  Thank you, sir. 
[00:58:30]  We're going to try the write the joke.  It might be a brand new bit on the Opie and Anthony show, starting with this one.  Let's say hi to Mouse the Trucker.  Mouse?  Yes, sir.  Hey, man.  How you boys doing?  Good.  Are you going to try the joke?  Yeah.  He got her pregnant because she wore a Rob Thomas mask.  Ho, hey, ho!  That's very funny.  We need the...  I don't have a...  I don't think I have a rim shot.  Yeah, we need a rim shot.  Ho, you got a rim shot now?  How could we be a wacky radio show with no rim shot? 
[00:59:00]  Derek will find a rim shot for us, okay?  If we're going to play write the joke, we need a rim shot.  I bet Tom Cruise has a rim shot.  Hey!  How come I'm looking for a rim shot, and I found the timpani drum roll I was looking for the other day,  and I found it in two seconds looking for the rim shot?  All right, Mouse, thank you.  Bastards.  You, write the joke on the Opie and Anthony program.  Lori, Wisconsin, what's up?  Oh, well, I don't have a joke.  I just...  I know why he didn't get Mimi Rogers pregnant. 
[00:59:30]  Why?  Well, according to her, they quit having sex because he had to purify his cock.  What?  Say that again.  I think...  I know, that sounds really odd.  Amy came with the Wisconsin accent.  Yeah, please say that again, Lori.  According to Mimi, they quit having sex because Tom needed to purify his cock.  All right.  She's a lady.  That makes sense.  Whoa, whoa, whoa. 
[01:00:00]  All right, Rox.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Is that a Scientology thing, I guess?  You've got to go through a purification?  I guess.  Get a lot of some thetans in your penis?  Put a little captain's hat on the end of your dick.  You've got to get rid of them?  And, you know, when you're in Scientology, I guess you can't use, like, painkillers when  you're giving birth?  No.  No?  So, good luck to you.  Good luck, Katie.  Good luck.  I don't think she's as deep into this Scientology thing as Tom is.  No.  I think she's just trying to be a trooper about it, but I think she thinks it's a little  kooky.  All right, we've got some audio.  Katie and Tom having a baby. 
[01:00:30]  Back here in Times Square, the talk is about great expectations in Hollywood.  Tom Cruise and fiancé Katie Holmes expecting a baby.  It caps the whirlwind romance, making headlines from the start.  And ABC's Heather Nauert has the latest.  It's been only six months since Tom Cruise announced to the world that he'd met an incredible  woman.  The love match between Tom and Katie Holmes has been fast and furious.  And now the engaged couple has even more exciting news. 
[01:01:00]  Tom's sister, Leanne, told ABC News that the 26-year-old actress is pregnant.  Katie's feeling just fine, according to People magazine, which broke the story.  Katie has been feeling great and that she's actually been very active.  You know, on the weekends when Tom has off, they've been biking and they've been hiking  and really enjoying quality family time.  So right now, the pregnancy has not slowed her down thus far.  He's doing a lot of activities.  Biking, hiking, anything to get his mind off of what he had to do to get her pregnant.  Biking, hiking. 
[01:01:30]  Oh my God, let's not remember that.  It was horrible.  I don't hear any activities that involve the bedroom.  Rogers once split, once told Playboy, she split from Cruise in 1990 because she had stopped  having, he had stopped having sex with her.  Uh, because he thought of becoming a monk and needed to purify his instrument.  She later insisted she had been joking.  All right.  I'm sure after Cruise's lawyers pounded down her door.  Right. 
[01:02:00]  Let's say hi to Doug Out Doug.  You write the joke on the Opie and Anthony program.  Yes, Doug.  Hey, guys, this is something cheesy one of the late night guys would say.  Hey, hey, he's having a child with Katie so he could be the father and the grandfather  at the same time.  Hold on.  I'm trying to sort it out.  I like this delivery, though.  The delivery saved it.  Well, it's supposed to be a fucking Letterman joke.  All right.  The hacky late night delivery was good. 
[01:02:30]  I got it.  Where was it going?  The fact that she's so young?  Old and she's young.  Yeah.  Father and grandfather at the same time.  You know, when I suck, I suck on purpose.  Now I'm punching the fuck out.  All right.  Thank you, Doug Out Doug.  Let's go to Miami.  John?  Yeah.  Katie Holmes is the first woman ever to be impregnated through anal sex.  Bagot, motherfucker.  Well, all right.  We're playing you right here.  Oh, my God.  Some will be bombs.  Oof.  Holy crap. 
[01:03:00]  All right.  Here's some more audio.  She'll need her energy.  She still has a wedding to plan.  Cruz, an active Scientologist, reportedly wants to get married here at the Scientology Celebrity  Center in Hollywood, a mysterious and secretive place.  Meanwhile, Holmes, raised a Catholic and now a Scientologist, is rumored to want to get  married on a beach in Mexico.  To a guy.  From the beginning, there was speculation they would marry.  Marriage.  Yeah.  It's exciting.  It's exciting. 
[01:03:30]  It is.  It makes me smile.  He's the most amazing man in the whole world.  Katie, look up!  Since the beginning of this very public romance, questions have been raised about how real this  made-for-the-camera's relationship is.  A baby may finally put those questions to rest.  No.  In Hollywood, there's always going to be speculation.  There's always going to be conspiracy theorists.  But right now, these two are welcoming a child into the world, and everyone's pretty excited  for them.  For Good Morning America, Heather Nauerts, ABC News, Los Angeles. 
[01:04:00]  They seem very, very happy, and we wish them both all the best.  No.  No, we don't.  She, she, Katie Holmes has lost all her hotness.  All the hotness has been drained out of her by him.  And now, getting her pregnant was the last straw.  That's it.  What was that movie where she was leaning against the car, naked?  Oh, that was fantastic.  The Gift.  The Gift, of course.  Look at her in The Gift.  That was the pinnacle of her hotness. 
[01:04:30]  Oh, there's the picture.  I did call this.  Gary Hoey's got to take a look, right?  That's Katie Holmes.  That's the Katie Holmes.  That's Katie Holmes.  Not the smiling, dopey-looking Katie with a baby in her.  Confused scarecrow.  I did call this, yes.  Thank you, Andy, in Ohio.  What is that?  When Tom went on his rant on his new girl, you said once the Tom hype went away, he would  come out and say, we're going to have a baby.  I did say that at the time.  Yes, you did.  So does that hype die down? 
[01:05:00]  Let me see the Mimi picture again.  Go back to Mimi Rogers.  No, we've already looked at that.  Oh, boy.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  What happened?  What year is that?  2004.  Oh, boy.  Wow.  There's a...  She's got a silly putty body.  There really is.  Wow.  And there's a lot of girls out there that wish their boobs were bigger.  Really?  What's going on above her mound?  That's what they call a bunt, Anthony.  No, it looks darker. 
[01:05:30]  Yeah.  From here, it looks like a C-section.  Well, you know, if there's shade, the moss grows a little thicker.  Is that what you're saying?  Her bunt has shaded it so moss has grown?  Does she have a mold problem?  Those tits are so long.  She has a good 17 inches of cleavage.  Yeah.  Wow.  She can play hacky sack with those.  They're bungee jumping down her belly button.  Yeah, they're just moving. 
[01:06:00]  They are so much closer to her belly button than they are her armpits.  Oh, yeah.  Look.  Her nipples.  Even with her elbows.  Yeah, they're almost at her belly button.  Wow.  There you go.  All right.  Well, Tom Cruise, like Maverick, the pilot he played in Top Gun, knew when to punch out.  He saw that happening, saw the disaster, saw that body flaming out.  He was going into a flat spin, and he punched out. 
[01:06:30]  Sure, goose cracked his head on the canopy, but look who he's fucking now.  Do you guys want to play You Write the Joke or what?  Of course.  All right.  We need a cute little, you know, You Write the Joke.  Steve will work on some.  Let's say hi to Mike in Jersey.  Mike, what's up?  Hey, boys.  Hey.  Cruise is so far in the closet.  The baby's going to come out smelling like mothballs.  All right.  All right.  We didn't say You Write the Brilliant Joke.  Hey, well, you know, this is a joke of a joke.  All right.  I'll see you.  And you know we've got to play this now until we get a really good one. 
[01:07:00]  So, Chris, You Write the Joke.  Hey.  Hey, how are you?  Hey.  Hey, what did Tom's baby from?  What were his first words?  Uh, what?  Hey, big, big daddy.  Whoa!  Dave in Pennsylvania.  Yeah.  What's the home pregnancy and Thanksgiving have in common?  Uh.  A turkey baster was used in a production of both.  Ah, you think a turkey baster. 
[01:07:30]  Punching out.  All right.  Let's say hi to John in Jersey.  John?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  So, Tom comes home and Katie goes to him.  I have wonderful news for you.  You're going to have a baby.  You go, this is wonderful.  Like, I call up the head of Scientology.  I call up the head of Scientology and he says, I got a man pregnant.  Ouch.  Uh, a lot of variations on this one. 
[01:08:00]  But there's a movie coming out about him getting her pregnant.  It's called Eyes Tight Shut.  Hey.  Derek.  All right.  Tom Cruise trying to impregnate Katie Holmes was like War of the Womb. 
[01:08:30]  War of the Womb.  Jesus, henchmen.  Now, I'm going to have to go to Internet Movie Database.  After it has begun.  Let's see.  Thad from Cincinnati.  Tom Cruise joke.  Now with the movies, he can get two child discounts and a senior citizen discount.  Oh, that one's horrible. 
[01:09:00]  Kevin from Westfield.  The pregnancy was accidental.  Katie was just using Tom's mouthwash for a douche.  Oh, holy cow.  Who saw that coming?  Very nice.  He got Katie Holmes pregnant, but he's, in his heart, he's really just looking for the remake of A Few Good Men. 
[01:09:30]  I dare you to take every Tom Cruise movie.  Oh, God.  I'm looking.  All right, you're looking.  Yeah, exactly.  It's really hard to do one to, um...  There's a risky business joke in there somewhere.  And, of course, cocktail.  Cocktail.  Everyone is now going to IMDb.  Yeah. 
[01:10:00]  A lot of people are saying that Tom got sick right after he had sex with her.  Really?  It's kind of true, because he was the color of money.  These are the jokes you wish your late-night guy would tell.  Right after he had sex with her, where did he go?  I don't know where.  Far and away.  Far and away. 
[01:10:30]  He told Katie, okay, I'll have sex with you, but I have to call you Jerry Maguire.  All right, there I gave you one.  You write the joke, people.  You write the joke.  That's what we're working on here.  All right, Oscar from Post...  What's number 24?  Oscar from posthores.net.  Low on material again, boys?  No.  No, it's...  No, there's some funny... 
[01:11:00]  Jesus.  There's some funny jokes in here.  Stop.  This is something we wrote down, my friend.  We're doing this...  This is off the cuff.  We're doing this on the fly.  On the fly.  All right, we'll get more jokes in a minute or two here.  Steve put together something very nice for us.  You know Al Jorgensen, lead singer of ministry?  Of course.  We had him in as a guest.  He told us a fascinating tour bus story.  He lost a toe, almost lost an arm.  He was a madman.  Blew up a tour bus. 
[01:11:30]  Mm-hmm.  I think this is the tour bus story.  He's going to call us very soon to talk about what he did in Japan, I guess.  Uh-huh.  It's another new feature we're doing on the show, Stories with Al Jorgensen.  But Steve put together this.  Gather round the campfire, kids, and toast yourself a marshmallow.  Settle in for another telltale from your old Uncle Al, Al Jorgensen.  You blowed up your tour bus?  Well, yeah.  And now, what happened?  Okay.  So, first, I have to preface this by saying, when I was in Nashville, Tennessee on the Lollapalooza tour in 90... 
[01:12:00]  Oh, back in 93, kids!  Anyway, so, this toothless, like, old man at this, like, truck stop where we go in and shop with sunglasses, like me, he's like,  Hey, you guys want to buy some fireworks?  I'm like, yeah, yeah.  And I bought this, what looked like a bazooka.  I mean, it was like, it was like six feet long metal tube, all right? 
[01:12:30]  And I forgot about it.  I set it up on there.  And then, Gibby Haynes from the Butthole Surfers was traveling with us for a while, too.  So, Gibby got into our M-80 supply that we used to throw at each other.  So, Gibby's like, hey, man, let's let these out on the bus.  I'm like, oh, that is so lame, man.  We do that every day.  What's wrong with you?  Oh, I remember.  I got this six-foot pyro on here.  So, we're in the back of the bus.  We light the fangs.  And this thing, the guy told me, I remember the toothless guy told me, he's supposed to make, like, a pirate ship in the air or something. 
[01:13:00]  He's supposed to make this galley in with multi-colored sh**.  So, we light the thing in a bus while we're rolling down the highway between Houston and Dallas, right?  So, we light it.  And I'm laughing.  I'm laughing.  I'm thinking, all right, we're going to put it out, okay?  And I'll light it and just freak it around a little bit.  Greg, like, just gets down on one knee at the very back of the bus and aims it for the front of the bus. 
[01:13:30]  That's all you can do.  Booyah!  The thing goes off.  Pellets bounce up the door and catch every bunk on fire, all right?  And the great thing about this was, is every fire was a different color.  Because this thing, it was so psychedelic.  Well, we're done spinning yarns today, kids.  And it's a good thing, too, because I got to go dig a hole and poop in it.  Come back soon for another tall tale from your old Uncle Al, Al Jorgensen. 
[01:14:00]  Very good job, Al.  I like that.  And we're going to have new stories from Al Jorgensen in the very near future.  You write the joke.  Want to keep trying this, Anthony?  Yeah, give it a whirl.  All right, let's say hi to Randy in New Mexico.  Randy!  Yo!  What's up, Randy?  Not much.  All right.  Tom Cruise could not have possibly fathered this child.  Like everything else, he's done difficulties in movies he used to stand in.  Well, it's a joke.  All right, Brian in D.C. 
[01:14:30]  Hey, Brian?  Hey, guys.  My first time getting on the air, so I got to say, I'm Brian Hughes, and I'm on the radio.  Okay.  Katie Holmes goes to Tom Cruise and says, hey, great news.  We're going to have a baby.  Tom Cruise says, oh, that's fantastic.  And she goes, not you.  Nothing.  All right.  See you, guys.  All right.  It was your first time, though, so we'll give you a little slack there.  I like watching something run its course, don't you?  Yes, sure.  Mandy from Milwaukee writes, apparently Tom Cruise is one of those guys that don't mind  asking for directions. 
[01:15:00]  That wasn't the punchline.  That wasn't done yet.  That was the big setup.  Holy shit.  It was directions.  It wasn't like a...  All right.  Apparently Tom Cruise is...  I'll try it differently.  Apparently Tom Cruise is one of those guys that don't mind asking for directions because  Katie had to direct him to the right hole.  There it is.  George from Philly.  What did Tom say when Katie told him she was pregnant?  Who's the father? 
[01:15:30]  And...  Stank on Hang Down from Whackbag.com.  What does Tom Cruise's baby and Scientology have in common, Anthony?  Uh, what?  They are both bullshit reasons for a tax break.  All right.  That's not bad.  That's not bad.  All right.  All right.  We have Susie Essman.  She's outside, ready to come into the studio from Curb Your Enthusiasm.  We should take a quick break and get to her next.  All right.  How's that sound?  Good.  But now I've just been handing more jokes. 
[01:16:00]  Caulfield from Whackbag.  Tom got Katie pregnant because she didn't want to wait for her life to be over.  Ah, the Dawson's Creek song.  Okay.  Right.  I don't want to...  Case from Whackbag.  Horrible.  Katie is having a baby because Tom has had sex with his last samurai.  Oh, holy crap.  Awful.  That is horrendous.  Brian, posthorrs.net.  When they're at the delivery table, Tom will be yelling, show me the baby. 
[01:16:30]  And if Tom was in a porn, it would be gaze of thunder.  Gaze of thunder.  All right, that works.  All right, let's say hi to Seth in Boston.  Seth.  Hey.  Hey.  I don't know, man.  Adam's too quiet.  These jokes are so bad, I'm actually missing Bob Kelly.  Adam's a smart one.  He's not going to jump in on this one. 
[01:17:00]  Nah, man.  Adam Farrar playing Rascals.  Rascals.  Starting tonight.  Tonight, yeah.  Through Sunday.  Okay.  And Gary Ho, you want to play us out of here for a little bit?  Can I try a joke?  Sure.  Even though I'm on the show, it's probably going to stink.  But Tom and Katie are having a baby because eventually everybody has to cruise homes.  Cruise homes.  Cruise homes.  Cruise homes.  Not any worse than any of the others.  That was terrible.  I'll play guitar.  How's that?  Yeah.  How about that?  I'll keep my day job.  All right, here we go. 
[01:17:30]  Are we up and running?  We're up and running.  Okay.  All right.  Where are we?  Maybe not.  Did I do something wrong?  What happened?  We were just hearing him.  No guitar.  Oh, no.  We need guitar.  Turn that thing.  There it is.  Here we go, baby.  All right.  Here we go.  Gary Ho, he's playing for us live today.  Check this out for just a bit.  Let's go. 
[01:18:00]  We'll be right back. 
[01:18:30]  We'll be right back. 
[01:19:00]  We'll be right back. 
[01:19:30]  We'll be right back. 
[01:20:00]  The sportscasters now want to be the stars, you know?  Yes.  That's what it's all about.  We get it.  Hey, Cud, go all...  I understand the way, shithead.  Hey, Cud, go all...  Cuddy?  Cuddy?  He has a 20-yard lead on the guy chasing him.  Exactly.  I think he's going to make it.  He's got Christopher Ede blown into a drum behind him.  Right, trying to move his wheelchair to catch him.  I think he's going to score.  That's so good.  Hey, Cud, go all... 
[01:20:30]  He sort of takes away from those special moments.  And it's like, you know, I've just seen the tape.  He goes off the...  Fucko.  He made the fucko list of Chris Berman.  Men is hard!  Men is hard!  And when guys hit home runs...  Oh, this is the worst.  Like, if you guys were both up and you hit home runs...  Yeah.  ...which you do in my eyes every day.  Of course.  Thanks for having me.  He would say...  He would say... 
[01:21:00]  They hit home runs...  A back-to-back and a belly-to-belly.  Dude.  Dude.  Back-to-back and a belly-to-belly.  And he goes, and da...  And a belly-to-belly.  Back-to-back.  And Andy Hawkins has been knocked out of the game. 
[01:21:30]  Holy shit.  And a belly-to-belly.  Ugh.  Too bad Ben didn't hit a home run.  A scalp-to-scalp.  And a hog-to-hog.  Lou Gehrig hits one.  Oh, shaky running around the bases.  It is high.  It is far.  It is gone.  Ramon.  Ramon. 
[01:22:00]  Bring Bam Tino a home run.  And a hit.  It is high.  It is far.  It is gone.  Back-to-back and fixed belly-to-belly.  Oh, my God.  And stapled belly-to-belly.  Yes.  They call me the Bear Bino. 
[01:22:30]  And Carly, she hits another bare bones home run.  Opie and Anthony, the virus is spreading. 
[01:23:00]  Opie and Anthony, the virus is spreading. 
[01:23:30]  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony program on XM Satellite Radio.  We've got lots going on today.  Adam Farrar sitting in.  Also, Gary Hoey playing us in and out of breaks.  Very good, Gary.  Thank you, sir.  And now we've got to say hi to Suzy Eschman.  Hello, boys.  Hello, Suzy.  Welcome to Satellite Radio.  Why'd you have to book me on the morning after the Yankees played at 10 the night before? 
[01:24:00]  Isn't that awful?  Yes.  I'm so goddamn tired.  And I said I wasn't going to stay up for the game, which I didn't.  But I stayed up for the beginning of it.  And then I woke up out of nowhere, like right when the game ended.  That's what I did.  I fell asleep on the couch.  Yeah.  And then I had to get the score.  And I've woken up at like 1.30 in the morning before.  But you don't move.  You kind of go, don't blow this now.  Get right back to sleep, you idiot.  You've got to get up.  And you go to sleep.  But I wake up and go, and you kind of can look at the clock. 
[01:24:30]  All right.  It's either go right back to sleep or know if the Yankees won.  I've got to know if the Yankees won.  You've got to know.  So then the next thing I know, I know the score.  And I'm watching South Park.  So I'm like, motherfucker, I'm awake.  You are screwed.  I know.  So, again, exhausted this morning.  I'm disappointed.  Yeah, this morning thing is fucking up our sleep schedule.  You get cursed, by the way.  Because I know Susie likes to curse.  No, it's not something that I do.  You love cursing.  Go fuck yourself.  You're a cocky mouth. 
[01:25:00]  You're a cocky mouth.  We saw you at the Donald Trump roast.  Oh, really?  Oh, man.  You had a great set.  But those people in that audience, oh, crap.  Well, it's a horrible room.  It's the Hilton Grand Ballroom.  They always have it there.  It's this cavernous, horrible comedy room.  We wouldn't know.  I mean, we were in the ballroom, yes, officially.  But we were in the back row, way up on the balcony.  We were guests of Rich Voss.  Rich Voss.  You might know Rich Voss.  And we were guests of his. 
[01:25:30]  So, yeah, we were there.  It was at the Hilton.  And we watched it from room 205.  Like, stupid us, you think.  Not even allowed in the venue.  Right.  Stupid us, you would think at this point in our careers, we would finally get it.  But Rich invites us.  And we're like, finally being treated like we should be treated.  Well, next year, I will invite you.  Oh, that'd be nice.  Everyone's going into the main ballroom, right?  And we show our tickets.  And they're pointing to an elevator.  And there's like three people upstairs.  There's like three seats upstairs.  And not only upstairs, we have the worst seats of upstairs. 
[01:26:00]  We were behind one of those big TVs that they put up there.  So, you missed seeing Freddie Roman up close.  You see, that's what you missed.  See?  Now, that's what I really wanted to see.  Old Freddie Roman.  They're so hard.  Aren't those hard, those roasts, Adam?  Those are huge.  In that big room.  They're hard.  And then you've got to wait to see when you're on.  Yeah.  Well, I will only do it if I'm on in the top three.  Yeah?  Really?  That's the power I have now.  Look at that.  You got that pole?  Look at that.  I think you're second to last on the Reiner Road.  Yeah, no, it's rough.  The later you're on, then everybody does your material. 
[01:26:30]  All your materials.  Right.  Like somebody like Trump, how many hair jokes can you do?  Oh, I know.  We were sitting there going, all right, here's more hair jokes.  He was trying to do Tom Cruise jokes before you got here.  Yeah, exactly.  That's hard, because he's just a fucking psychopath at this point.  Yeah.  Yeah, we agree on that.  That's what happens when you're a closet case.  You know what I'm saying?  We absolutely...  The man wants to suck a cock, so instead he criticizes.  What happens?  Well, they're having a baby, though.  Did you read the papers yet today? 
[01:27:00]  They're like a real baby?  Yeah.  A real baby.  She's pregnant.  Mission Impossible.  Tom and Katie.  Mission Impossible.  What I want to know is, what was he fantasizing about when he was having sex with her?  Rob Thomas.  There you go.  Was one of them.  Sometimes you had to wear a Rob Thomas mask.  Rob Thomas mask.  But you know what's just kind of another thing where you're like, this guy has got to be gay,  is he's acting like he thinks a straight guy is supposed to act when he actually falls in love with...  Yeah, exactly. 
[01:27:30]  When you fall in love with a girl, you do.  You get your head over heels.  You want to tell your friends about it and everything.  You feel good.  But he's doing it so over the top.  The jumping on the couch.  Yeah.  If my boyfriend ever did that, I would break up with him.  It's an act of someone in love.  Get on the couch.  Get off.  Get your feet off the couch.  It is definitely an act.  It's someone acting like he thinks somebody should act.  But you know, don't you love how he has no credibility anymore whatsoever?  Oh, none.  I mean, who's going to hire him? 
[01:28:00]  Yeah, even Steven...  What was it?  Spielberg.  Spielberg told him, you know...  He doesn't even work with him anymore.  That's it.  The guy was supposed to be promoting my movie.  He's out there talking like a lunatic about psycho drugs.  It's unfortunate because he did...  Like, you know, if you think of like Born on the Fourth of July, and he did some good stuff.  Yeah.  But...  Risky business?  When Spielberg won't work with him anymore, though.  I like risky business.  That's like, in Hollywood, you better have some kind of career if Spielberg isn't talking  to you.  Yeah, he'll come back, though.  You think?  Yeah, they all come back. 
[01:28:30]  Look, Richard Nixon came back.  They all come back.  He's got the...  The thing is, he went completely nuts with the Scientology thing, to where people are like,  John Travolta's just as kooky as he is with Scientology.  But he keeps his mouth shut.  Yeah, he keeps his mouth shut.  He doesn't talk about it much.  And he flies jets.  You've got to respect that.  I fly jets, and I got Deetons out of my body.  But him, he's acting like he's straight.  And he's just screaming about...  And you can cure anything with exercise and vitamins. 
[01:29:00]  And so, all Jeffrey dominated was a multi.  But you know what?  I always think that...  I just lost my train of thought.  Oh, no.  Something about the gayness, the overcompensatory behavior.  I lost it.  Sorry.  Go ahead.  That's all right.  You're tired.  Early.  The Yankees.  The Yankee thing.  Yankees lost last night, right?  Yeah, we're at.  We're tired.  Didn't the game end?  Oh, I know what I was going to say.  These guys that go out with the 12-year-old girls, the reason they do that is because  these girls have no sexual experience, so they have no idea how bad these guys are 
[01:29:30]  in bed.  Is that what it is?  That's what it is.  So, like, a guy would be...  That's really not it.  A guy that is confident in his sexual prowess would then look for an older woman to say,  Look, you've been through a lot, but let me show you this.  It happens to be a fact that women in their 20s don't know anything sexually.  Women reach their sexual peak at 35.  So, you get a woman in her 40s, they're much better in bed than the woman in their 20s. 
[01:30:00]  They don't look as good, maybe, but they're much more proficient in bed.  Is that it?  Yeah.  I mean, Adam, back me up.  What?  No, I think we have a difference in the day.  I always think that when you see a guy that's going out with a really young girl...  You think, a lucky bastard.  No, you think that is an insecure...  When you see, like, Murray, you know, with a 12-year-old on his arm, not 12, but like  a 22-year-old on his arm, he thinks people are looking at him thinking, Look at how fabulous  Murray is, that he got, you know, this young hot babe on his arm. 
[01:30:30]  And I'm thinking, You must be so fucking bad in bed that she doesn't know the difference.  That's what it is.  Yes, stupid Murray.  I'm thinking Murray's rich.  Well, yeah, that too.  Yeah.  Women will go out with anything.  They will.  What does that mean?  But they're actually attracted.  I mean, women are actually attracted to money and power.  They're not attracted to looks so much.  Well, usually, you do see that when you see a beautiful woman with an old, like, horrific 
[01:31:00]  guy, and then...  Well, that's just a money thing.  Yeah, you would think she would absolutely not be with that guy if he was just the guy  that worked at the deli.  But she might actually be sexually turned on by the money and the power.  Whereas men...  Here's an example.  Men are turned on...  Like, a woman will marry a guy.  They'll say she's just marrying him for his money.  But nobody says about a guy he's just marrying her for her big tits when he is.  Right.  So, I mean, it's not really a fair thing.  You think it goes right into the bedroom? 
[01:31:30]  I'm in aberration because I'm attracted to poor men with big tits.  You think it funnels down into the bedroom, though?  Like, the money power thing?  Yes.  Women get turned on by that.  Yes.  Interesting.  They get turned on by that.  They're not as turned on, but men are more physically, visually oriented.  $100 bedsheets.  That's why women are not so turned on by pornography, whereas men are.  It's just...  It's in the DNA.  There's nothing we can do about that.  Rolling on condoms with your Amex number on it. 
[01:32:00]  Yeah, exactly.  Baby.  I don't like a rich guy.  They're too high maintenance, like a Donald Trump or, you know.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  They're way too high maintenance.  That guy's got it before he leaves the house.  You don't have to lose their ego.  That's all you have to do.  And you don't have to do that with poor guys?  No, it's different.  Not only you've got to soothe their ego, you've got to pay for dinner.  You've got to pay for everything, yes.  But it's different.  There's not the same ego thing going on.  You know, I don't want a guy who calls out his own name when he's coming.  You know what I mean?  That kind of...  Like, Trump looks like that kind of guy to me.  You wouldn't go out with Trump.  Oh, get the fuck out.  First of all, he's intensely... 
[01:32:30]  He's got a hot broad, though.  Gee, and I wonder why.  I think I had a line in the roast where I said, we know why he's attracted to Melania.  She's beautiful, she's sexy, and what she sees in him is, you know, a million dollars  in high cholesterol, basically.  See, he's cute.  Now, not her.  On the TV monitor, Matthew McConaughey.  He's cute.  Oh, he's doing the talk show circuit?  Yeah.  He's rich, too.  Now you attracted to him?  I'd fuck him.  He's insane, too.  Oh, is he?  I like that.  The cops found him naked, all stoned out of his gourd, playing bongos at some disturbance 
[01:33:00]  call that they had.  But with another guy.  Yeah, it was him and another guy.  So, what's wrong with naked bongo playing with another man?  Nothing.  I was bitching that the cops showed up.  I thought it was two guys having fun.  This guy is so cool, though, he was able to skate that and no one is questioning his gayness.  That's a little weird to be playing bongos with your friend naked.  Is it cool or no one really cares about Matthew McConaughey?  I don't know.  No, they care.  They care about those things. 
[01:33:30]  Scandal.  Yeah.  I think that guy is so cool, he was able to explain that away and everyone went, ah,  all right.  What time do you guys get up in the morning?  Too early.  Too early.  Why?  It's ridiculous.  I'm just curious.  Five?  Five?  You have to wake up at five?  Yeah.  What the fuck?  Wake up at five.  I live out on Long Island, so I got...  Well, that's your first mistake.  But I hate living in the city.  Why?  It's all night here.  Because I want to escape from this shithole every so often.  No.  No.  No kids.  So why would you live in a suburb if you don't have children?  Do you have a dog? 
[01:34:00]  No.  No pets.  I want...  Oh, you know what?  You serve no purpose in this life.  We've been saying that for months.  Here's why I live out on Long Island.  Let's go.  Do you know I can leave my house and get into here and never leave the heater or air conditioner  of some type of vehicle?  It doesn't like being outside.  I go to my heated garage, hop in my Escalade, leave, the door opens, the evil world doesn't  even touch me.  And I'm out, I leave, I pull up in front of this place, I'm in. 
[01:34:30]  Well, thank you, Howard Hughes.  I mean, why don't you just get a bunker underneath this building?  We've been calling him for a while.  Well, and I am the only Catholic guy living in an entirely Jewish neighborhood, which  is fantastic.  They all take care of their property wonderfully.  The landscapers come by, everything.  Where do you live?  I live in Great Neck.  Oh, so it's all the Syrian Jews.  Yes, yes.  Yeah.  So I was there, and the first thing I had to do was...  We don't consider them Jews, by the way.  There's mezuzahs on the door, they're Jews. 
[01:35:00]  That's all I knew.  I was taking a hammer and claw hammer, taking the mezuzahs off, because I didn't know what  kind of mystical Jewish spell would be.  Should I leave the mezuzah on?  Should I leave it on?  Yeah, because you never know.  I mean, I feel like...  You know, those are like fortune cookies.  There's a little note in there.  Yeah, but you might as well be covered.  Who knows who the real person is.  You're right.  You know something.  I'm not saying go out and buy a mezuzah and put it up, but if it's there, I would leave  it there.  If it's there, just leave it.  Yeah.  Yeah, cover all places.  Like if you moved in and there was a big crucifix over the...  As a matter of fact, in Sunday's episode, there's a whole thing about a mezuzah.  Really? 
[01:35:30]  In this coming episode, this Sunday.  Of course.  Which I might add is a classic Susie Green episode.  Of course, we're talking about Curb Your Enthusiast.  Yes.  Which is one of my favorite shows.  One of the best shows on television.  Absolutely funny and cutting edge.  Just stuff that...  I don't know why people sit and watch network television anymore when stuff like this is  available on cable.  I agree.  It's amazing.  I agree.  Love it.  It's a fun show to do, too.  Larry Davis is a blast.  But this Sunday is a whole religion episode. 
[01:36:00]  And it's all about you?  No, it's not all about me.  But you've got a big part this week?  People have been complaining that the first two episodes, I was too nice.  Yeah.  That there was no...  But this episode, there's a couple of classic...  We want to hear a...  Classic fuck you, Larry.  A six fuck moment.  There's a couple of...  Yeah.  I can't be angry screaming in every episode.  Right.  It doesn't, you know...  Right.  It has to be a dynamic fish.  But because of that role you play, we were a little intimidated as far as having you  in here today.  Now, ask Adam.  I'm not really like that.  You're a sweetheart. 
[01:36:30]  She's a sweetheart in real life.  Yes, she is.  I'm just waiting for...  Fuck you guys.  I'm out of here.  Don't push me.  I see that.  But...  I see that in your eyes.  Don't push me.  You know what?  I had, like, a fight with a delivery guy the other day.  That's where I find that it comes out.  With, like, you know, inept service people.  Yeah.  Where I just go Suzy Green on them.  You know?  It's become, like, you know, a part of...  Then I think it's okay because I'm actually getting a lot of accolades and making money  doing that behavior.  Yeah.  So I think it's okay in real life.  And it's not...  Yeah, in real life.  Now you can unleash it and it's just part of your character. 
[01:37:00]  I never do it on loved ones.  Only on, like, unsuspecting, you know, Chinese delivery men.  Are they screwing up that bad with you?  I can't...  You know, there's nothing more annoying when they fuck up your order.  Yeah.  You're hungry.  You're home.  You have an order and they totally fuck it up.  You're so disappointed.  You know?  And then it's just...  Then you just unleash.  Absolutely.  I order sushi all the time.  And it's the same place.  It's right down the road from my house.  And I would love to give out the name of the street I live on, but I'm not going to do that. 
[01:37:30]  But it's not that hard.  It's not that hard a street.  And it's the same person answering the phone every day.  And I'm talking a year I've been ordering.  And I tell them the name of my street.  They repeat it back like I threw Scrabble letters out and said, just read that.  They have no clue what I just said.  Well, Anthony, can I tell you something?  If you lived in Manhattan, it's computerized.  Yeah.  You call for delivery.  You give them your phone number.  It's all on the computer.  The address is right there.  You're just out in the suburbs of Great Neck with the fucking Syrians. 
[01:38:00]  Okay?  That's it.  In your bubble like John Travolta.  Exactly.  It's safe.  It's nice.  And I see grass every day.  Are you married?  No.  You have a girlfriend?  Yes.  Does she live with you?  Yes.  Yes.  What does she do?  Nothing.  Nothing.  She's going to the gym today.  And by the way, Anthony has a lot of confidence.  Now, Opie, where do you live?  Yeah, good.  Get on him.  Because I used to be the one that had a complete lack of confidence in my sexual prowess in the bedroom. 
[01:38:30]  But now you're the guy.  Susie, we just want to let you know that both of us have a lot of confidence.  Well, it's good to know.  Going back to what you were saying earlier.  Well, a few years back when I first hooked up with my girlfriend.  How old is she?  Well, put it this way.  For the first year of our relationship, she couldn't drink.  I know so much about you now.  Just to know that you're not married.  You don't have kids.  You live in the suburbs.  You're afraid of the city streets where there's real women. 
[01:39:00]  Yeah, with cocks sometimes.  But I'm Jimmy Norton.  What's wrong with a woman with a child?  Hi, big dick patty.  Best of both worlds.  Right.  I live in Manhattan, and I'm in a similar boat as Anthony.  Meaning what?  No, he's in a similar boat.  Meaning you're dating a 19-year-old?  No, not 19.  22.  Shut up.  I happen to know Adam's girlfriend.  You guys aren't married, are you?  No.  No.  She happens to be a real human being.  Right.  A wonderful woman.  Look how freaking happy I am.  That's right.  Look how miserable he looks. 
[01:39:30]  Look how happy Anthony and I are.  It is such a treat.  Look, if you guys go out to dinner and you've got to cut her meat, that's fine.  Whatever you guys got to do.  I am very happy in my relationship.  I love when the UPS guy comes to the door sometimes and says,  Is your daddy home?  And I have to come and sign for the package.  You know what?  At least we're getting this off our chest because Susie's like talking like she did a little while ago on it. 
[01:40:00]  I'm looking down and kind of kicking the floor.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I've got no confidence.  That's why the uncomfortableness is there for a while.  That's fine.  Listen, you know what?  Zeitgeist, if you're happy and healthy.  I've got to tell you, I've never been happier.  Good.  Never been happier.  Good, because she just idolizes you.  She has no idea how bad you are in bed.  She thinks they're all that size.  Exactly.  She has no one to compare you to. 
[01:40:30]  After you have sex, she wants to color.  It's fine.  See, I'm smart now.  I'm not even going to attempt to defend myself as far as my bedroom thing goes.  I was married to a woman my own age for a while.  He did 10 years.  I put in 10 years.  He did 10 years in country for 10 years.  I just bought her a house.  Oh, in a divorce amendment?  It's wonderful.  Yeah.  That's why I started trolling the high school.  You know what?  Honestly, if I may have a real moment, it's so hard to find the person that you're going to get along with. 
[01:41:00]  So, if that's what you've found and that makes you happy, I'm happy for you.  You know how nice it is when you were married and just the demands on your life and then you get a divorce and the whole thing with the house and cars and money and alimony.  And now you have an idiot who doesn't know the difference.  It's perfect for you.  You're just a friggin' Snickers bar and a carnival every so often.  Exactly.  She laughs at everything you say. 
[01:41:30]  Of course.  I play those carnival games.  I win or something.  I'm the best guy ever.  Thank you, Big Daddy.  You know what?  I'm not one to talk.  Before, my boyfriend now, he's around my age.  But for the years, I went out with the younger guy.  You're dead.  Always.  Yeah.  I'm just going to go out with some old fuck.  I want some old fucking guy.  Massaging his prostate is not my idea of foreplay.  You know what I mean?  I want that for.  I want some cute hot guy.  If he's just going to be a snack, if he's not going to be, you know.  But then the references get a little difficult. 
[01:42:00]  It's a little off.  It's just a little harder to relate.  Yeah.  Yeah.  On the younger.  Don't you find that?  Just maybe on the presets.  You know when they're like, who's Gilligan?  You know what I mean?  It's a little difficult.  On the presets on your radio.  You know, you get your XM.  You got all your presets.  And then you're hitting, you know, the classic rock.  The classic rock.  Yeah.  She's on XM Kids.  She's on Disney.  She's watching the Disney.  She's watching Nickelodeon. 
[01:42:30]  What are you doing?  You know what it is?  Can you TiVo that so raven?  It is kind of odd.  We got the DVDs case by the TV.  And I got my favorites.  Fast Times at Ridgemont High and Platoon and things like that.  And then at the bottom, there's like the Little Mermaid and Legend.  Little Mermaid?  Yeah, yeah.  Like Disney cartoon things.  No, wait.  Anthony, how old is she?  All right.  She's 14.  She's not 14.  But she's very smart.  The Little Mermaid, she loved the book a lot better than the film. 
[01:43:00]  And that's why Anthony can't really leave his house.  She's in her mid-20s now.  Oh, all right.  All right.  She's not a teenager.  No, we've been together five years.  Okay.  I'm doing the math.  It's not bad.  Whatever.  Whatever.  You could be this motherfucker over here.  Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes.  Tom and Katie Holmes, you know?  Well, curb your enthusiasm.  I mean, you guys are off to a great start this season.  I think so.  I'm serious.  This is going to be the funniest season yet.  The dog episode this past Sunday was funny. 
[01:43:30]  Wasn't that funny?  Oh, my God.  I didn't see that coming.  That's all I'll say.  Because a lot of people watch it on demand and stuff, so I don't want to give it away.  But I did not see that coming at the end.  Well, he just takes on every...  He takes on every...  You know, this season, he really is just...  I mean, some of the episodes, I read the outlines in the beginning of the year, and I'm just  like, I think he's going over the line.  I think he's going over the line.  Sometimes.  Sometimes, and then he pulls it, and then I see it, and it's fine.  You know, but even I think that at some point.  That was...  They got a lot of that during Seinfeld, too, that they were kind of skating some issues. 
[01:44:00]  Yeah.  I mean, this week, it was the lesbians, it was blacks, it was the handicapped, it was  everything.  But he goes even further down in a future episode.  Give us an example, maybe from a past show where you read the script, and you went, what?  We can't do this.  He's gone crazy.  There's only one time that I thought that, and that was the last, I think it was last  season, or no, season three, with the kid with the big penis. 
[01:44:30]  Yeah.  That was the only time where I was like, all right, I think he's really pushing it here,  talking about the two-year-old's big penis, you know?  But it worked.  It was so funny.  Yeah.  It was so funny, and I forgot, I think it was Richard Lewis who referred to the kid as  Uncle Miltie, which is hilarious, you know, because for those of you who don't know, Milton  Burrell had a huge cock.  Yeah, the other one that was legendary.  Legendary.  Him, and then Forrest Tucker.  Forrest Tucker.  Gary Cooper.  A big one.  Gary Cooper.  And supposedly Liam Neeson.  Really?  Yes, I've heard.  Liam Neeson. 
[01:45:00]  Yes.  He looks like he has a very large penis, doesn't he?  I don't know if guys can tell that by looking and saying.  He lives in my neighborhood, and he just looks angry all the time.  Yeah.  He looks like he's going to kill someone all the time.  I don't think he's so angry.  The type is depressed.  You think he's depressed?  Yeah, I think he's just one of these very dark, Irish, depressed kind of, you know.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Me and Ben, we were on Martha's Vineyard like two summers ago, and we saw Larry David.  Yeah, he lives there.  He has a house there.  Yeah.  Yeah, we, uh, it's a dumb story, but, uh, we're back. 
[01:45:30]  So why are you telling it?  Well, because we'll find some humor out of this somehow.  That's how I preface my dumb stories, by saying they're dumb.  Uh, the house that, like, Ben's father was staying at was close to John Belushi's grave.  So I'm like, I've never seen John Belushi's grave, so I went, and it was like, whatever.  You know, there were beer bottles and all that crap right there.  I respect the gravesite.  Yeah.  And then we're, uh, we're going back, and, uh, we see Larry David, I can only describe  it as him very, very high, walking in the middle of this town road that's very busy, staring 
[01:46:00]  up at the trees in the middle of the road, just walking.  That's just Larry.  Larry doesn't get high.  No?  No, Larry is not a drug.  He doesn't get high.  No, a drug or drinky person at all.  So we drive by, and I go, Ben, that was Larry David.  And we had to get a second look, because we're like, no way, was that Larry David?  Just walking in the middle of the road, staring at trees.  I'll tell you why he does that, so he doesn't have to talk to anybody.  Oh, really?  Anthony does that, but he moves to Long Island.  That's right.  And sure enough, it was Larry David just wandering around on this country road. 
[01:46:30]  I mean, he was probably just thinking.  He doesn't get high, Larry.  He doesn't need to get high, right?  No.  He's not.  He, I don't think he likes to have any kind of loss of control, I don't think.  And the Larry.  I mean, I don't know.  I don't know his, you know.  Is it true of the Larry David we see on HBO, that's pretty much him?  No, not at all.  Really?  Because if you think about it, how could that person, the character he portrays on the show  is such an asshole in so many ways.  How could he go through life like that?  And how could he have, like, run the most successful show in the history of television? 
[01:47:00]  Mm-hmm.  Right.  Or run the show.  I mean, he runs Curb.  I mean, he's the executive producer and the showrunner and all that.  How could he do that and have people, underlings, listen to him if he was that much of a jerk?  Sure.  Now, until Curb Your Enthusiasm, you really didn't realize how much of an influence he  had on the show Seinfeld.  Oh, yeah.  Like, everybody just thought it was, you know, Jerry and the made-up character George.  Gee, I wonder if that was a bone of contention with Larry.  I wonder.  Jeepers.  Because now you watch and you realize, oh, my God. 
[01:47:30]  It's all Larry brain.  It's his characters.  Did you know him from the clubs?  No.  Or that was before your time?  No, I didn't know Larry.  Yeah.  Because Larry, you know, I knew Larry from years ago doing stand-up.  We just kind of overlapped a little bit because he's older than me.  Yes.  Than most of us.  But Larry was always the comedian's comedian where he would get on stage and the audience  would stare at him like he was totally retarded.  But the comedians would be hysterical laughing because his material was so great.  You know, but he had no...  He didn't understand that as a comedian, you're supposed to connect to an audience. 
[01:48:00]  He just didn't get that.  He didn't get that you're supposed to connect.  You know, and I used to emcee all the time at Catch a Rising Star.  And there's always that moment when you're crossing the comedian when I say,  please welcome Larry David.  And I'm walking off and he's walking on.  And he would always say to me, stay close.  Because you had a time slot.  You had 15 minutes, 20 minutes.  And he would sometimes do like a minute.  Like he would look at the audience.  Oh, like stay close.  I could be leaving at any moment now.  As the emcee, usually you go out to the bar.  You go to the bathroom, whatever.  You come back and give the light. 
[01:48:30]  But, you know, it would be like, stay close.  And I remember times where he would just get up and he would look at them and say,  never mind.  And just walk off.  The whole audience would be laughing and one person would not be.  And then he would just look at them and be like,  I don't need this.  And just walk off.  You know, it was just.  Wow.  Yeah, he was wild.  But funny.  But he was funny.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I never saw his act.  I mean.  And you never will.  Yeah, and you never will, right?  Because I don't think he's going to reprise it.  No.  But it's great how somebody can get up on stage as a stand-up like that 
[01:49:00]  and not connect with the crowd.  And then be in charge of a show that just, like,  is one of the funniest shows on television.  Well, because he had the brain.  He had the comic brain.  But having, being funny and being a comic,  Adam Altestis, are two completely different skills.  Right.  You know, there's always these people that come up to you after a show.  Oh, I'm really funny.  I could do.  It's a completely different skill to be able to stand on stage  and control an audience.  The wacky Bob in the office can't do a half hour.  Exactly.  It's a completely different skill. 
[01:49:30]  So Larry didn't have that particular skill.  He was able to, like, put it through Jerry.  He's a great writer, yeah.  And, yeah, and he's a great writer.  And the subject matter he comes up with is ridiculous.  And how is the show put together?  Is it true that it's a lot of improv, like I've read?  It's a very detailed outline.  Because you could see, when you see the show, how tight the story is.  Right.  I always think Larry's genius.  Like, you know where you're going to go, but.  Yeah.  I always think Larry's genius is story.  That's his real genius, if you look at it.  You know, because everything has a payoff.  Everything has a callback.  Everything, you know, it's so tight. 
[01:50:00]  So there's a detailed outline, about seven, eight pages.  Each scene is laid out.  What information has to be gotten out in that scene?  But there's no dialogue written at all.  That is so cool.  All that filth that comes out of my mouth is just, it's just all mine.  Your filthy mouth.  It's all mine.  And what do you guys, try the scenes many different ways?  Yeah.  Well, we shoot.  There's always two cameras.  We have to shoot a lot of coverage, because so much is done in the editing, because there's  no script.  You don't, and usually it's a page a minute, but we don't have a script, so it's all improvised. 
[01:50:30]  So we shoot tons of coverage.  And sometimes we find a scene, first take.  Sometimes it takes us like 10, 15 takes to actually find the scene, and what it's about.  Wow.  But there's always information that has to be gotten out.  What a brave way to do a show.  To me, it's great.  I love it.  As a comic, it's like perfect for me.  There's no other show doing that, really.  Is there?  I don't think so.  You did a show that was improvised, didn't you?  Yeah.  On Comedy Central?  Lenny and Adam, we did.  Yeah.  Me and Lenny Clark and Leary.  Was it kind of the same way? 
[01:51:00]  Well, we don't know.  We only did the pilot and didn't get picked up.  That's nice.  Take your successful show and just pound him with that one.  Some people are going to try to imitate it, and what they don't have is Larry's story brain.  That's why it works.  Yeah, right.  Because the story, at this point, I mean, it's not, it's like writes itself.  When I see the outline, I know exactly what he wants.  Yeah.  It's like dialogue of the unconscious.  They're all based on, like, his psychosis and his paranoias and...  Well, one of the reasons why the improvising of it works is because nobody's saying cutesy, 
[01:51:30]  funny punchlines.  Yeah, here comes the set-up joke, set-up joke.  It's not that sitcom thing.  It comes out of character.  It comes out of character and situation.  It's a true situation comedy.  Those are awful.  What do you watch?  What are you entertained by on television?  I watch the Science Channel.  That's a great crowd.  That's what I...  Yeah.  I don't, I don't, on my faves, on my remote, I don't even have networks.  No.  No.  There's nothing worth watching on any of that.  No, I don't watch any of that.  I call the History Channel, though, the Hitler Channel. 
[01:52:00]  I watch a lot of, the Hitler, all Hitler, all the time.  I don't care what story they're working on.  I know.  It's like...  All Hitler, all the time.  Yeah, a biography of Alexander the Great, and there's Hitler.  And Hitler.  It's, again, they got to have footage, you know, of all the troops marching.  I know.  There's some Nazi running that channel.  They love him.  Or maybe it was Simon Wiesenthal, but he's dead.  Yeah, no.  Not speech, Simon.  Yeah.  All of us show them, as we say.  Oh, is that it?  Yes.  Is that what you say?  Yes, that's what we say.  We say...  Am I the only Jew in the room?  I think so. 
[01:52:30]  Look around.  You are definitely...  This one is so not a Jew.  No, I'm an Irish Catholic.  Because with all those tattoos...  Not the tattoos.  Well, Rich Voss is Jewish, and he's got a goddamn...  Star of David tattooed on him.  And you know that he could never be buried in the...  Buried in the...  Yeah, we learned all that because of him.  He can't be buried.  No, well, Larry did a whole episode about that.  I don't know if I saw that one.  It was called the special section where his mother died, and they couldn't bury her.  They buried her in a separate section because apparently she had a tattoo on her ass that  You never knew about that one.  Really? 
[01:53:00]  That was funny.  Very nice.  Well, we can't...  Me...  Because my girlfriend's Jewish, and we can't...  She said we can't be buried in the same family because I'm not Jewish.  Unless you convert, which would mean you'd have to get circumcised.  Guys do that all the time.  They convert.  So do women.  Now.  Which makes me kind of think, what is your belief system?  That just because you believe in Jesus Christ, let's say, then you find some rich fucking  Jewish guy to marry, and all of a sudden you don't believe in Jesus Christ.  Yeah.  It's such bullshit.  Just for the guy or the girl. 
[01:53:30]  Yeah, exactly.  It's for the money.  Of course.  Like, that's a test.  That could be a test that God is giving you, and you just fail it like that.  You just fail it.  Just for the pussy or the dick.  I know.  Just like that.  Or the cash, yeah.  There's no commercials on this station.  None.  Oh, what a delight.  We babble endlessly about crap.  And then we feel like not babbling anymore.  We wrap things up.  Gary Hoey takes us to break.  And our breaks consist of...  PSAs for, like...  PSAs, yeah.  Take care of your kids.  Don't do drugs. 
[01:54:00]  And then they talk about other channels on XM.  Listen to The Rock.  Listen to the classic.  Can I plug something?  Of course.  Go ahead.  Okay.  Caroline's.  Right here in New York City.  You can't come, Anthony.  November 4th and 5th.  And then the HBO Comedy Festival.  Are you doing that, Adam?  Which one?  The one in New York?  The one in Vegas.  No.  Vegas.  HBO Comedy Festival in Vegas on November...  I think it's the 17th to the 20th or something like that.  Very good.  Some such thing.  In the rare instances.  I've never been to Vegas.  Never? 
[01:54:30]  What?  I have never been to Vegas.  Get out of here.  I swear to you.  That is odd.  You've never played Vegas?  Never.  You know, I barely leave my house.  I'm agoraphobic.  Ah, see?  Yeah.  See?  I'm you.  You've got to move out to the country.  Only in Manhattan.  In Manhattan.  Well, for you it works because you've got to work, so you go out and...  Yeah.  I just kind of hide away.  But one of the few places I do go is Caroline's.  Well, come November 4th and 5th.  Not both.  No.  Because I don't have that much material.  That I'm going to be doing different acts.  I just saw this.  Curb Your Enthusiasm Sunday.  What's the episode about this coming week? 
[01:55:00]  You know, I don't want to tip it off, but I'll just say that breasts play a large part.  Breasts and Jesus Christ play a large part of the episode.  Something that I think a lot of people are involved with in their lives.  Breasts and Jesus Christ.  Yes.  We want to thank Susie Essmann for stopping by.  We greatly appreciate it.  Thanks for having me, guys.  This was definitely a lot of fun.  And as she leaves, we'll have Gary Hoey play us out for a little bit.  All right?  Here we go.  Gary Hoey, everyone. 
[01:55:30]  Gary Hoey.  Once again, Susie Essmann.  Thank you, Susie.  Play Hava Nagila.  We'll see you next day.  Bye bye.  Bye.  Bye bye.  Bye bye.  Bye bye.  Bye bye.  Bye bye. 
[01:56:00]  Bye bye.  guitar solo 
[01:56:30]  Like sands through the hourglass, so is the O&A virus.  I took this one girl to one of these really crappy hotels after the bar.  She was so hot, right?  Yeah.  I banged her sister years ago, but this one was the hot one.  So I take her to the hotel.  It's like, you know, 30 bucks or 40 bucks.  So we go within like two minutes in the room, three minutes.  I, you know, I finished.  I came.  It was just I couldn't hold back. 
[01:57:00]  So I called the front desk and I said, I saw a roach so I can get half my money back.  I don't want to spend a second.  I was going to get up again.  So I go, I just saw roaches.  So I got half the money back.  Can you tell?  I'll tell the one about the other one.  Can you tell my favorite hotel story or the motel story?  My favorite.  I don't even care if the faithful listeners have heard a million times.  It's great for the new ones.  Did you go to the front desk with a menorah and matzah in your hand just to really push 
[01:57:30]  across that Jew point to yours?  Well, it's not a Jew thing.  It's a Jew thing, you cheap fucker.  No, but I'll spend, I'll drop money all over the place, but there's certain, like, you  know, I'll spend $500 on dinner for friends, but pick up golf tees the next day.  It's weird stuff.  You know, if you shoot alone in three minutes, you want some money back.  You should win a prize, right?  It should be like, you know.  Tell the motel story where you picked up the girl.  I picked up this one girl after a show at Rascal South. 
[01:58:00]  So we go, I go, let's go to the diner.  You always take them to the diner.  That's to, you know, get them alone first and to the car or whatever.  So we're outside the diner parking lot.  We're making out in the car.  And she goes, I can't do this here.  It's a diner parking lot.  I go, okay.  So I pull next door into the car watch, right?  So she goes, I can't do it here.  And it's like, okay, well, I know a nice place.  Not a nice place.  It's just a little dumpy hotel.  And it's on the other side of the highway.  I drive there.  And it's like a crack hotel, right?  I mean, the place doesn't have a car in it. 
[01:58:30]  It's like a total.  Yeah, the parking lot is completely empty.  Completely empty.  So we're in the car fooling around before I go in.  And she, you know, gives me a handjob.  And I come, right?  I have an orgasm.  So I'm thinking, well, you know, I'm not going to get a hotel room now.  Now.  So I go, hold on.  So I go, well, let me go in and get a room.  So I walk in.  I come back out.  I look at it.  I go, they're all sold out.  And she said, there's no car.  I go, yeah, it's a crack hotel. 
[01:59:00]  They don't have cars.  They don't drive.  They don't drive.  It's all sold out.  They've all walked up.  You're such a creep.  But I gave her my CD as a parting gift.  I do that to a lot of girls.  She wins.  Here, take a little piece of me home with you.  When you hate your life, this can confirm it.  To be an athlete, the virus is spreading.  Here, take a little piece of me home with you.  Here, take a little piece of me home with you.  Here, take a little piece of me home with you.  Here, take a little piece of me home with you.  Here, take a little piece of me home with you.  Here, take a little piece of me home with you.  Here, take a little piece of me home with you.  Here, take a little piece of me home with you.  Here, take a little piece of me home with you.  Here, take a little piece of me home with you. 
[01:59:30]  Here, take a little piece of me home with you.  Here, take a little piece of me home with you.  Here, take a little piece of me home with you.  Here, take a little piece of me.  Here, take a little piece of me.  Here, take a little piece of me.  guitar solo 
[02:00:00]  And we're back with the O.B. and Anthony program.  We've got Gary Hoey live in studio today,  playing us in and out of breaks.  Check out Gary Hoey at  GaryHoey.com  H-O-E-Y  GaryHoey.com  He's heading off to Asia tomorrow.  He's got a new CD out.  It's called what, Gary? 
[02:00:30]  It's called Monster Surf.  Monster Surf.  I like you.  Susie rocks.  That's got to be a pain in the ass  flight over there, huh?  How long does that take?  14 hours.  Ah, that's a piece of cake.  14 hours.  Four hours in, you go,  well, 10 to go.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, you get about nine meals  by the time you get there.  Yeah.  Crazy.  They don't know what else to do. 
[02:01:00]  They just keep feeding you.  The mail starts coming to the plane.  Here's more shit, Dave.  We don't know what to do  to entertain you.  Are you a good flyer  or like after seven hours  you're looking at the engines going,  they've been going for seven hours  and they've got to go seven more.  I'm actually really good  with the flights now over there.  It doesn't even phase me anymore.  Really?  I've gone so many times.  I can do the 14 hours, no problem.  And I can sleep on planes now.  I couldn't when I first started touring,  but now I can sleep standing up.  Thank you, Klonopin, in the rain.  I flew over that ocean one time  and well in back, I guess. 
[02:01:30]  Not that ocean, right?  Thank God.  What?  Not that ocean, the other one.  The Atlantic Ocean?  You flew the Atlantic.  Oh, yeah, I know.  No, he's going the other way,  which is even worse, I understand.  But, yeah, in the middle of the whole thing,  you're in the middle of the ocean  looking down at the water going,  oh, my.  Ain't no runways down there.  That's the anxiety I felt.  I don't get anxiety attacks,  but I think I got one that day  because I was just like,  I just start thinking.  You start thinking about stuff,  going, well, you know,  if there's a mechanical, you know,  problem when you're over land, 
[02:02:00]  there's still options.  That's why there's things to do on a plane.  That's why they give you things  and you're supposed to bring things.  Everything in your carry-on  is to keep you from thinking.  Right.  Because you shouldn't be thinking.  The movie that they play?  Yeah.  That's to keep you from thinking.  Because if you all just sat there,  like on a bus,  where you just,  if you just sat there,  everyone would start going,  hey, we're really high up.  Right.  And then it starts getting to you  and you think,  well, we're in the middle of nowhere.  The ocean's down there. 
[02:02:30]  And if there's just an engine thing,  we can't just land at some silly airport  in the middle of the desert.  Right.  Or what have you.  But if you're watching,  all of a sudden you realize  you have no options.  Yeah.  No options whatsoever.  I like to know that there might be one option.  One option.  You're like having something  in your own control  where if something happens,  at least I could hightail it out.  I could try my best to escape.  That's just,  here's my life.  You take it for a few hours.  It's all yours.  Yeah.  I'll pick it up again in L.A. 
[02:03:00]  I'll pick it up when we get there.  That's such a great way to look at it.  But in the meantime,  I have no say over anything that happens to me.  I get,  you know what I always think about?  Remember the Bugs Bunny  where he's in the plane  and it's crashing  and he just steps off the plane  right before it hits.  At the last minute.  At the last second.  Are you actually looking at that  as a viable option?  I'm like,  maybe I can do that.  You need something.  Maybe that'll work.  You do need something.  And then I'm like,  well I hear when they do have problems  they go to,  where,  like New Finland or something?  Yeah,  they kind of veer off 
[02:03:30]  to the north there.  Maybe that's an option  I could take with me  for the next eight hours.  Yeah,  look out the window  to see the lights of New Finland.  I don't want to hear the word divert.  I don't mind flying  in commercial planes  but I don't like little helicopters  and little teeny Cessna's  like four-seaters.  No.  Those are the ones  that freak me out  more than the big planes.  Yeah.  I flew to Australia  with Lenny Clark.  Now that is a long flight.  That's just,  and with Lenny,  and you know,  it was like,  with Fat Lenny or Skinny Lenny? 
[02:04:00]  It was Big Lenny.  It was Big Lenny at the time?  Big Lenny at the time  and it was,  I had to keep drugging him  like a rhino.  You don't want him  waking up in the cage.  Take this.  What is that?  Shut up.  Take this.  How long does that one take?  16 hours.  16.  16.  Yeah.  Whoa.  I don't know.  Anything over three sucks  in my opinion.  I know.  When you're,  like flying to L.A.  it's just,  are we there yet?  Actually,  the JetBlue's not bad  because you get the TV.  Yeah,  we saw.  You get the direct TV.  Wow.  Then you can watch yourself.  Yeah, 
[02:04:30]  you can watch your crash landing.  We saw that.  That was great.  Hannah Farrar is going to be at Rascals.  Rascals in Montclair.  Montclair starts tomorrow night.  Very,  very funny guy.  Very funny guy.  You guys want to get  the Punisher in here?  Is he making them?  We're ready for the Punisher.  They're chit-chatting  the comics out there.  Susie Espin said,  Carl's been serious here.  You comics are all like,  you all know each other somehow. 
[02:05:00]  You work together somewhere.  There's never one comic  that meets another  that doesn't know him  or hasn't worked somewhere  with him back 20 years ago.  I never met her before.  I just knew her from Curb.  So I was like,  wow,  that's awesome.  It's called Comic Rottery.  Is that what it is?  That's Gary Hoey.  What's up, buddy?  Good morning.  How are you?  Pleasure to meet you, man.  We're going to do something  a little different today.  We're going to have  Carl's Mencia play the guitar  and Gary Hoey's going to tell jokes.  I'm going to do stand-up, man.  Can we do that?  No,  I think I'll stay sitting down. 
[02:05:30]  That could be a fun thing.  You can probably,  you can only play  those big,  fat guitars.  I'm the only beaner  that doesn't know  how to play a guitar, dude.  I'm the only one  in the history of me.  I don't know how to play a guitar.  I can play the accordion, though,  which is even gayer.  How do you pick up  the accordion  and why?  Well,  because like,  you know,  my mom growing up  used to listen  to that stupid-ass  wet-pack music  and my dad  got an accordion  so he got my sister  to actually  learn how to play it 
[02:06:00]  in the Spanish community.  Wait,  if we could find  an accordion right now,  you'd be able to play it?  No, dude.  I refuse to do that.  I'll tell you that I can,  but I ain't going to do it.  That's even gayer, dude.  Come on now.  I'm afraid about our show.  You would never find  an accordion.  Someone get us an accordion.  Pronto.  You want it?  I want to see.  Carlos, don't worry.  They can't get an accordion.  Jen from Seattle  had to send a new bullhorn,  so there's no way  they're going to get an accordion.  We're not going to get it.  an accordion.  And is it like...  You'd be surprised.  Because I'm thinking  polka music is all I know 
[02:06:30]  about accordion,  but I would think  that Spanish...  You'd never heard?  Go to like  authenticmexicanmusic.com.  Go there,  and I'm telling you,  they all have that  diddly-diddly-diddly-diddly-diddly.  I swear to God,  I don't know what it is.  The guy with that  big, wide guitar.  Mariachi band.  That's all I ever see.  Yeah, but that's  the mariachi guys.  Yeah.  The guys that  wear the pants  or tapered all the way  and they're really tight  from top to bottom.  Why does the guitar  have to be so thick?  Why do they have to be so fat? 
[02:07:00]  They interrupt you  while you're trying to eat?  Come up to your table  and stop playing?  It's like,  you were okay  like 20 feet away.  I liked you  when you were at that table  over there.  Right now,  it's annoying.  Stay still.  Stay away from the diners.  Then you gotta nod awkwardly  like,  good job.  Good job.  Thank you.  That's not the worst.  The worst is that  if you actually know the music,  it's annoying  because they try to play  the artistic,  their own version  of the song.  So just imagine,  you know what I mean,  a lounge singer  and you're like, 
[02:07:30]  oh man,  I want to hear  whatever song  and they play it  like with their version of it.  It is so fucking annoying  because you want to sing along.  You know what I'm saying?  So you go,  play more than a feeling.  Oh,  I know that song.  You know what I mean?  And they're like,  instead of more than a feeling,  they're like,  more than a feeling  and you're like,  dude,  that's not how the song goes.  You know?  It's unbelievable.  I would think  if I was requesting it  to a mariachi band  that he probably wouldn't know  how it goes.  No,  but I'm saying,  comparing,  comparing, 
[02:08:00]  like the Spanish version of,  sometimes they'll play  English songs too.  Yeah.  Like they're getting into that.  They're trying to cross over.  So when you go,  like I did this mariachi festival  and this one group of mariachis  was actually playing  like Led Zeppelin and Beatles songs.  Really?  Yes.  Well?  Were they doing it well or?  It was funny.  Yeah,  it was funny.  Entertaining.  It was very entertaining.  Well,  who didn't like  Jose Feliciano's version  of Light My Fire?  Ah,  of course.  He Spanished that one up a bit. 
[02:08:30]  Do we have that?  He actually got away with it.  Do we have a little taste of that?  Everyone liked it  right up until the  Light My Fire,  Light My Fire,  Light My Fire,  and I was like,  okay.  All right.  You were doing a good job.  I was getting into the whole groove of it.  Sounded cool.  Sergeant Alameda,  and it went off with the  Tourette's version.  All right.  Now we've got to find the damn thing.  Hold on.  Oh,  you're going to be able to find it,  Hawk?  Of course.  Hawk's at the helm.  There it is.  Right?  I don't hear Light My Fire yet.  I'll have the burrito and taco combo. 
[02:09:00]  This song was huge  back in like the 70s.  Is it because the song's good  or because he's blind?  I think it's blind,  Spanish.  You know what I'm saying?  It was a Doors song.  It was after Chico and the man  where he had some popularity.  You know that I would be a liar  You did do a good job of it.  It's pretty good, man.  I mean, it's...  There's no Gary Hoey. 
[02:09:30]  I saw him do it live on Flip Wilson,  I think.  Right after the Here Come to Judge skin.  But see what I mean?  He does what I told you.  Yeah.  He changed the song so much.  Yeah.  It's just a shadow of its former self.  Like, if you knew the actual song  and you wanted to sing along,  you'd be fucked.  Yeah.  Yeah, Clapton did that with Layla.  And that was his own song.  All right.  Very, very good.  There you go.  That's a guilty pleasure, though.  Sometimes you're punching around, 
[02:10:00]  you want to relax, drive,  and not have extreme road rage.  You just, you know,  someone cuts you off  and when he's like,  you know that it could be...  You're like,  that's okay.  Cut me off.  That's fine.  You go,  what hurry am I in?  You know what?  Let me pay that toll for you.  Just as long as they don't cut you off  during the,  let my fire,  let my fire,  let my fire,  that's when I got a punch out.  I'm out of the song.  Let my fire,  let my fire.  Jose,  you were doing so good.  Well,  we're in an uncomfortable position,  Carlos,  because we had a comedian  come on the air. 
[02:10:30]  Oh,  don't be uncomfortable.  That guy,  don't worry about it.  That guy's been talking smack  for years, dude.  For years.  That's why I like finally said something in Tucson,  because the guy had been talking so much smack.  It was like,  dude,  just stop talking about me.  So,  for all you like,  into this whole thing people,  you can call a morning show called  The Locker Room in Denver,  called KBPI,  and ask them if three years ago,  this guy was talking smack.  It's just like,  oh my God. 
[02:11:00]  I don't think anybody's actually denying the fact  that smack is being smuck.  But it's like,  No,  he is.  He came in here like,  oh,  it's on now.  It's like,  dude,  it's been on for you forever.  What are you talking about?  And I want to go on record and say that I like both of you guys,  so it's a weird thing.  A weird thing that's going on.  Don't be weird.  For me,  it's go to my website.  I was at,  read my bio page.  I've been to Carlos' house.  I've hung with Joe Rogan at the store.  Rogan says,  I know Carlos' lovely wife, 
[02:11:30]  Amy.  I was invited to,  what was I invited to when I was out there?  Oh,  I don't know.  Was that your engagement party back then?  But you don't have to,  dude.  That's my point.  I've never said anything bad about Joe Rogan's comedy.  Here.  You give me a credit card?  No,  check that out.  Because he said that I made up my name,  dude.  That's a green card.  What's my name on the green card?  Honduras.  My name,  actually.  Ned.  Ned what?  Mencia.  There you go.  Ned A.  Mencia.  There you go.  You got a green card?  Yes.  Wow,  this is cool.  I'm a beaner, 
[02:12:00]  dude.  When I say I'm a beaner,  I'm a beaner,  bro.  You were born in 1915?  No.  That's like high tech and shit.  What's on the back of that?  Dude,  ever since 9-11,  bro.  Yeah.  We all fuck around,  dude.  It's got a hologram  and all kinds of shit in the back,  dude.  There's holograms on this.  Yeah,  yeah,  exactly.  Permanent resident card?  Exactly,  dude.  How creepy is that?  Why do you need this?  Yeah,  I'm not an actual citizen yet. 
[02:12:30]  Why is that?  Because I like took the test  and then you got to get sworn in  and I had a gig.  Are you shitting me?  And like a true American,  I took the money.  You went for the money gig before?  So now I got to do it all over again?  What do you got to wait?  Oh,  now you got to take the test all over again?  Yeah,  I got to take the test all over again.  Is that a hard test?  Yeah,  what questions do I ask you?  God,  I should have brought it,  dude.  You should have.  Because I guarantee you,  I would get it on the internet.  Oh yeah,  you can get it on the internet.  It's like,  who was the first president?  What are the three branches of government? 
[02:13:00]  You know,  who's the president now?  You know,  that kind of stuff.  So far,  I'm all right.  So far,  I was thinking that in my head.  What are the first 15 amendments to the constitution called?  Bill of Rights.  Bill of Rights.  Yeah,  just stuff like that.  But then there's a couple of them that you're like,  what?  Oh,  fuck.  You know what I mean?  They ain't gonna let me in.  I guarantee we got a lady dying on the phone,  she will fail the test.  Can we throw her out of the country then?  Please.  Yeah,  I would love to.  But the other thing is,  is that if you've been here over 20 years,  you can take the test in whatever your native tongue is. 
[02:13:30]  All right,  here we go.  Get the fuck in.  So my dad took the test in Spanish.  That doesn't seem like you should be able to do that.  Did he pass?  Yeah,  but it was easy for him because I read it and I was like,  these are in Spanish,  dad.  Don't you think you need to know them in English?  And he was like,  no,  they're going to ask the questions in Spanish.  And I was like,  are you fucking kidding me?  You can become an American?  Oh,  we got the questions up?  Yeah.  What are the colors of our flag?  Was that one of the questions?  Right.  Red,  red,  red,  blue.  All right.  How many stars are there on the flag?  Yeah.  50.  50 or? 
[02:14:00]  48.  Are you about to say 48?  That one I know.  I'll tell you the ones I don't know.  What color are the stars on our flag?  Blue.  What do the stars on the flag mean?  Blue.  White.  They're white.  They're stars,  dude.  They're white.  Blue background.  Wow.  Opie,  are you a citizen?  Are you a citizen?  Oh,  you're going back to Europe,  bitch.  Send them back.  We don't need to know this shit. 
[02:14:30]  We're here.  I agree.  I was born here.  I don't need to know crap.  What else?  Let her rip.  How many stripes are there on the flag?  13.  What do the stars on the flag mean?  Yeah,  13.  That's one most people don't know.  And that represents the original colonies.  What color are the stripes?  Red and white.  Red and white.  What do the stripes on the flag mean?  Yeah.  Colonies.  Colonies.  Very good.  How many states are there in the Union?  The states in the Union,  50.  Puerto Rico would say 51,  but...  Well,  that's why I was ready to say more than 50. 
[02:15:00]  No,  it's 50.  They're not a state.  The Puerto Rico thing is getting a little squirrely.  They want to be a state.  Why do we celebrate the 4th of July?  What is the date of Independence Day?  Independence from whom?  What country did we fight during the Revolutionary War?  England.  England.  Who is the first president?  Washington.  Who is president today?  An idiot.  Dick Cheney.  Dick Cheney.  There you go.  Yeah,  we get it. 
[02:15:30]  Let's see.  It just goes on and on.  There's got to be some in there.  What are the duties of Congress?  Uh-oh.  That's a tough one.  I've got to pack my bags.  Drink.  Screw pages.  The duties of Congress.  Congress.  Yeah,  they make laws.  That's the legislature.  All right,  here's a tough one.  How many?  Legislation makes the laws.  Yeah.  Congress.  Congress makes the laws.  How many?  Executive interprets and judiciary enforcers. 
[02:16:00]  How many?  The opposite.  Where's my card?  Judiciary interprets.  Judiciary interprets and executive enforcers.  Executive enforcers.  Yeah,  exactly.  How many changes or amendments are there to the Constitution?  Wow,  how many amendments?  Ooh.  Total?  Oof.  Can I take out the ones I don't agree with?  Well,  the first 10 of the,  10 of 15 of the Bill of Rights.  15 of the Bill of Rights.  That's the first ones.  Look at this room of fucking retards.  For how long do we elect each senator?  Senator?  Senator.  Is that six?  Six years,  I think. 
[02:16:30]  Yes.  What are the duties of the Supreme Court?  Nobody knows.  Nah,  now it's getting...  That should be too interpretive at all.  Now I'm getting out of hand.  They're getting a little picky now.  Who was Martin Luther King Jr.?  Why is that on there?  Who said,  give me liberty or give me death?  Nathan Hall.  I thought it was Ethan Allen.  They called him,  they called him Than-Hale though,  which is weird.  A lot of people don't know that.  Than-Hale?  Than-Hale,  yeah.  That was the first guy that won a...  Our own,  right.  I keep going,  but this is on a really bad blue background, 
[02:17:00]  and now I can't see shit.  Are you going blind watching that?  I cannot see...  I cannot focus anymore.  Obi, is it as blue...  He's rubbing his eyes!  Is it as blue as the stars on the flag?  All right.  How many amendments were there?  Was it like 30?  I can't even...  Something?  Are there answers?  Holy crap.  Are the answers there?  No.  No, there's no answers.  Don't need no stinking answers.  They give you the answers.  Oh.  There you go.  Dick Cheney,  what is the president?  See, 
[02:17:30]  now you've got to match it up  with the question,  and now we don't have the question.  That's hard.  So I can just tell you,  answer 33 was 435.  That test is hard.  There you go.  It gets pretty hard, dude.  But then it's verbal.  They get to ask you  whatever they want.  So, you know.  Oh, you've got to know  all the capitals?  Oh, you're kidding.  Oh, boy.  That's rough.  All the capitals?  Yes.  I know Des Moines and Albany.  That is really hard.  What is the capital of Alabama?  Montgomery.  Very good.  Ooh.  Wow.  What about, 
[02:18:00]  let me try to get a,  how about Kansas?  Kansas?  Yeah.  Jesus Christ.  That would be,  Arkansas,  Kansas is,  Kansas is,  are you looking?  Topeka.  Is it Topeka?  Yes, very good.  It is.  Topeka.  Damn it.  How about Kentucky?  That was a,  that's a tough one.  Kentucky.  Louisville.  No, it's not Louisville.  That's a big,  that's the big city there. 
[02:18:30]  People are screaming  at their radios right now.  No one's,  no one's going to get it  in this room.  Kentucky.  Frankfurt.  Stop reading.  I didn't read.  Did you read?  How am I reading?  Where?  Right over here.  Oh, right.  I can see that.  Why not?  It's 20 miles away.  All right,  I'm going to,  all right,  hold on a minute.  Did you really not cheat?  He cheated.  Of course I cheated.  I have,  I'm like a honk.  I know what happened.  All right,  how about, 
[02:19:00]  he didn't even know  Frankfurt was in,  Germany.  One more and I'm  hiding the answer.  South Dakota.  South Dakota?  Who cares,  really?  Like,  that's what I like,  that's what I would answer  during the test.  Who cares?  It's South Dakota.  St. Paul.  Pierre.  That would be Minnesota.  Pierre.  Pierre.  Pierre,  South Dakota.  What?  Anyway.  Who cares,  but see what?  Who cares about the capitals?  Well,  you're going to care  because you got to do  the test again.  Yeah,  I got to do it like  in a couple of months,  actually.  How could you take a gig 
[02:19:30]  after you did all the prep work?  It was a lot of money,  dude.  It was a lot of money,  bro.  Especially at the time.  That just seems like  one of those things  on the priority list,  becoming American citizen.  Because I thought,  what could be,  what could be more American  than taking a job?  Getting the money.  Yeah,  okay.  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah.  John in Philly,  go ahead.  Yo,  Patrick Henry said,  give me liberty,  give me death.  Not Ethan Allen,  retards.  I was joking about 
[02:20:00]  the Ethan Allen  because that was the boat  that capsized.  Was it Nathan Hale?  I said Nathan Hale.  Yeah,  he said Nathan Hale.  The Sand Hale?  Right,  right,  but the Ethan Allen  was obviously a dumb joke.  Let's go to Robert in Dallas.  Robert?  Yeah,  the Bill of Rights  is the first 10,  not 15?  Yeah.  I'm Canadian,  and I,  I mean,  come on,  guys.  All right,  thank you.  Let's go to Eddie.  Eddie!  Yo,  dude!  What's up?  I'm a fan.  Listen, 
[02:20:30]  guys,  every motherfucker  that takes this test  and passes it  should get an automatic  into any fucking college  in this country they want.  I swear to God,  I got my answers  from Princeton,  and I don't know  half these fucking answers.  Yeah,  imagine if you had  to take the test  to stay.  This country  would be like  the Old West again.  They'd be giving out  land in the middle of it.  There'd be nobody here.  But you know  who would pass?  All the immigrants  would pass  because they'd study.  They study,  they have to,  like if you ask  my dad 
[02:21:00]  all these questions,  he'd come in here  all badass  answering them all.  You wouldn't understand  half his fucking answers.  Do you know  what I'm saying?  Yeah.  He'd be like,  you know,  he'd say Pierre,  but it would sound  like Paco.  You know what I'm saying?  Paco!  Did you say Paco?  It's Pierre.  That's what I said!  You know?  I panic when I come  back into America  and I'm convinced  they're going to ask me  something.  You're not going to  let you in?  And I'm not going to  know it.  Like do the Pledge of  Allegiance or something  like that and I'll be  like, ugh.  Alright, I'll try. 
[02:21:30]  I always get scared, dude.  Always get scared  when I'm coming back  into the country.  Oh, and you got the  green card.  You must be like,  it's like a spin the  wheel every time you  come back.  Dude, every time, bro.  And every time in the  past few years,  they've recognized me  so they give me a pass  every time so far.  Thank God.  Did you ever end up  in a little room?  No, they haven't done  that to me yet, man.  I ended up in a little,  you did the Montreal,  right, the festival?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I ended up in a little  room.  On the way back?  On the way in. 
[02:22:00]  On the way in?  On the way in.  What the hell did they  think they were doing?  I don't know.  There was something,  because what happens  when you do the  Montreal Comedy Festival,  they got a,  your name's supposed  to be on a list  for some bizarre reason.  My name's not on a list.  So I'm in a room,  my girlfriend's in  the other room,  my girlfriend's from  Montreal, and all I hear  is, I live here,  he's with me,  and I'm like,  just send me back  to the States.  I don't want to do  the friggin' festival,  just send me back.  Meanwhile,  Middle Easterners  are going in there  going, I'm going to  blow some shit  up in America.  Come on in.  Yeah, we don't want  to profile you. 
[02:22:30]  We don't want to  profile you.  That ticking is my wife.  Exactly.  They got a conga line  right next to it.  Meanwhile, Adam,  what are you here for  to tell jokes?  Bullshit!  Bullshit!  You and your  fucking jokes.  Bullshit!  We don't believe you.  We have to look in  your ass.  You're on the  comedy watch list.  No, my name is  just similar.  I hate having a  national talk show  because you get to  talk to people from  South Dakota.  Chuck, go ahead.  Yeah, you guys  pronounce that wrong.  It's Pierre, not  Pierre.  Pierre? 
[02:23:00]  Pierre.  Pierre, South Dakota.  You know, I drove  through South Dakota  once and I found it  a fascinating state.  The Badlands are there  and so is Mount  Rushmore.  I stopped and  looked and I enjoyed  your state, Chuck.  Don't forget  Crazy Horse.  Crazy Horse, right.  But Crazy Horse  and the No Helmet  Law.  Crazy Horse has not  been completed, right,  sir?  Nope, it has not  been completed.  That piece is done  but not the rest of it.  They've been working  on that damn thing  for well over 50 years,  I believe.  Yep.  And they ran out of 
[02:23:30]  money.  Did they?  No government funding.  Of course not.  It's for an Indian.  They refused government  funding.  That's right.  It started with one guy  passed it down to his  son after he died,  right, sir?  Yep.  And they're very good,  Opie.  And what are they  doing this for?  It's going to be a  big stone face?  Well, no.  They're going to build  an Indian hospital  and everything at the  base of it.  But what is it,  a statue?  A statue like Mount  Rushmore.  It's pretty much  Mount Rushmore. 
[02:24:00]  That's not done  but the casino next to  it is kicking ass.  The casino next to  it is rocking.  Yeah, fuck the  monuments to any of  these guys.  Get the card tables  out.  Oh, yeah, the  blackjack.  It's here, South  Dakota.  Thank you, Chuck.  Thank you, Chuck.  Say hi to the other  six people that live  there.  I'd rather pay  tribute to Chief  Running Aces.  Chief Double Down  says we must be  tax-raised money. 
[02:24:30]  I met an Indian  girl about six  months ago and her  name, I swear to God,  was actually Cha-Ching.  Cha-Ching?  Cha-Ching.  She said it was more  like Cha-Ching, but I  was like, that's Cha-Ching.  I was like, that's  Asian.  That's badass.  There are people in  this country now,  ethnic groups, that are  claiming like 0.1%  Indian just so they can  open up casinos and sell  tax-free cigarettes.  You want me to tell you  the sick part?  I do a lot of casinos  now, and especially  like anywhere in the  Southwest, after all the 
[02:25:00]  tribe want to meet you.  So they're always like,  the tribe would like to  meet you.  Sometimes it's in your  contract, you've got to  go hang out with the  tribe after.  So, you know, you're  excited, man.  I'm going to meet some  real Indians, and I  swear to God, every  single time I walk into  a room filled with the  tribe, here's what I get.  And then they all look  at me, and they go,  1.16, that's all you  have to be, is 1.16.  That's all you have to  be.  My grandmother fucked one  of them, poof, I got in.  I'm like, what?  They're all in. 
[02:25:30]  They're all beaters,  dude.  They're all Mexicans.  It's ridiculous.  Well, that's obviously  the Southwest.  Yeah.  Up in the Northeast here,  the Indians we have up  here, especially out on  Eastern Long Island,  black guys.  They're black.  And they're out there  as American Indians  getting this tax  exemption, trying to open  up casinos out there,  but they are black guys.  Are you serious?  How, motherfucker?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Are you Indian?  Don't give me no shit,  motherfucker. 
[02:26:00]  I'm an Indian.  Yeah.  And that's...  I'm a hof your ass.  You will not find one guy  that owns a casino or  is selling tax-exempt  cigarettes going,  hmm, what do you like  him?  You know, the guy that  looks like the Braves  with the Cowie truck.  The Cowie guy.  Nakahoma.  Chief Nakahoma.  I've only met a couple  that actually look like,  you know, like real Indians.  The rest of them,  they're just like,  dude, come on.  I've only seen real-looking 
[02:26:30]  Indians at those degrading  pow-wows they put on for  Whitey, where they go around  and they wear the feathers  and, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi,  and they just look like  they want to fucking kill  themselves.  Yeah, yeah.  You don't have to.  That would be the same thing  as a black guy getting up  and going, well, let me do  some soft shoes for you.  Right.  You know, and doing a tap  dance and opening his eyes  real wide.  The Indians don't have to do  that.  Stop it.  You've got the casinos.  Just rape us blind.  You got me real bad  at Mohegan.  They're finally getting even  because they gave white 
[02:27:00]  people tobacco.  Yeah.  So now the biggest killer  in America is, you know,  smoking-related illnesses  and they got casinos.  Yeah, that makes up  for the anthrax blankets.  Exactly.  That makes up for the  chicken pox and all the  other shit.  There you go, Injun.  You and your tribe  Cole take these blankets.  White men, nice.  Give me warm blankets.  Throat scratch them.  Runny nose.  Wow, we're being called  out like crazy stuff.  Pete in New York, get ahead. 
[02:27:30]  Hey, guys.  How you doing this morning?  All right, Pete.  I want to ask this  unfunny spick.  Why are you not talking  about what Roku said  about you, man?  Why are you not  defending yourself?  What do I need to defend?  Hey, Ned, this guy was  on the air talking about  you saying you steal  people's material.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Just so you know,  did he tell you  what joke I stole?  He was on the...  Yeah, he was on the...  Did he say what joke  I stole?  Look, I'm not him.  Well, then I'm telling...  Then I'll tell you this.  You're not defending yourself  against what this guy said.  Because you don't have to.  He didn't tell you  what joke I stole.  You're on the air  being unfunny. 
[02:28:00]  Nobody's laughing  at you, dumb shit.  Why don't you talk  about what happened  and defend yourself  instead of being  a stupid, dumb,  unfunny spick,  you fucking asshole.  Because...  Because he never said  what I stole.  Well, we got some quick clips  that we could go through it  real quick.  You don't have to.  See, the whole thing is,  had he come up here  and said,  hey, this is the joke  he stole,  I'd say,  listen,  I did that joke,  but for all the people  that have any interest  in this,  I record every single set  that I do.  So like this weekend 
[02:28:30]  when I'm at the club,  I'll actually record  every show.  So from 1996  up until now,  I've recorded pretty much  every single set.  So if anybody actually  wants to see my material  since then,  go to carlosmencia.com,  go to the page  where you can purchase  the albums,  type in a date  where I performed,  and you can actually  get an archived copy  of anything you want.  But until somebody says,  this is a joke he stole,  why the fuck would I,  why would I even  want to get into it?  Yeah, that was one of  Rogan's points of contention,  was the thievery. 
[02:29:00]  Well, he accused me  of stealing,  and he accused,  what's his name,  of stealing?  What's that other comic?  Dane Cook.  Oh, Dane, okay.  But with Dane,  he gave you an example.  He said he stole my joke  about animals fucking  and he turned it  into hippos.  That's exactly  what he did.  Now when somebody  steals your shit,  you go,  hey,  this is the fucking joke  he stole.  Yeah.  He said,  I claim I'm Mexican.  Read my bio.  I've never said I'm Mexican.  I said my mom's Mexican.  I grew up in East LA. 
[02:29:30]  Here's the joke,  so for everybody  that hasn't heard it  at some point in time,  here's how the joke goes.  I was born in Honduras.  My mom's Mexican.  My dad's from Central America.  I grew up in East LA  where no matter what I say,  no matter what I do,  I'm Mexican.  White people,  wherever you go in America,  you're still white.  When I go to Miami,  I'm Cuban.  When I go to New York,  what am I?  The audience goes Puerto Rican,  and I go,  fuck you motherfuckers.  That's the joke.  Right.  I've been doing it forever.  I've never lied.  People know my name's Ned.  I don't care.  That's like it's an attack.  Ooh, Ned. 
[02:30:00]  Ooh.  I want to hear the audio now.  Ooh, Ned.  I know, right?  It's just a quick clip.  He's claiming that you're  a fake Mexican.  It'll make for interesting radio.  That's what.  Play it right here.  This is Joe Rogan.  Mancia claims to be Mexican.  His name isn't even really  Carlos Mencia.  That's a fake name.  His real ethnicity  is he's half German  and half Honduran.  Look at my face.  Are you German?  Yeah, look at my face.  Doesn't it say Hofbrau?  This is real.  This is all real.  I invented the name  Carlos Mencia.  I'm going to a Nazi rally 
[02:30:30]  just so they can accept me  for the German that I have.  By the way,  stop that.  Stop that right there.  And see the guy.  See, that's my point.  This motherfucking guy  calls in saying  defend yourself,  calling me a fucking spick.  Defend me from what?  You just fucking defended me.  You called me a spick.  I can't be a fucking kraut  if I'm a spick.  What am I,  a bean or schnitzel?  Where did the German thing?  It was fucking retarded.  Where did the German thing come from?  Because you don't look German.  That's my point.  And that's what I usually do. 
[02:31:00]  You look this,  you look...  Right.  My great-grandfather  was born in the Cayman Islands  and I checked his last name  and it comes from Germany.  But I don't know anybody  that comes from Germany.  So that's where that comes from.  Great-grandfather, huh?  What did...  His name was...  Adolf Hitler.  Hitler, wasn't it?  Hitler.  I knew it.  It was actually Eichmann.  But...  Well, the one thing  I want to say, man,  is I'm in the entertainment business.  I mean, people change  their names all the time  for show business. 
[02:31:30]  It's like how many people  have grown up, you know,  and they've changed their name  when they became famous  or right before.  That's why it's not anything  I need to defend.  That's my point.  All right, Gerhard Hoey.  Something you're hiding  in your past?  Yeah.  You need to defend yourself.  My defense is my website.  Go read it.  It actually tells you  that my father's name  is Roberto Holness,  my mom's mugged the liniments.  Yeah, it tells you  everything you need to know.  Just go there.  This is too much fun.  Let's finish the clip.  His name is Ned Holness.  Ned.  This is real. 
[02:32:00]  This is all real.  I didn't know that.  Invented the name  Carlos Mencia  to ingratiate him  with the Latino community  of Los Angeles.  Mm-hmm.  So this fucking retard...  His name is Ned?  Yeah, his name is Ned.  Yeah.  He's got a fake name.  I mean, this guy's  so fucking stupid.  His whole reason...  His whole reasoning  for why people  call him a thief  is that they're jealous.  They're jealous of him.  This fake fucking Mexican  living this fake life  stealing people's material.  All right, that's the...  Wow. 
[02:32:30]  That's pretty much  the gist of the...  Oh, poor guy.  You're a fake Mexican.  Poor guy.  That was...  And you know what sucks?  We like being  in the middle of this.  I'm not going to lie to you.  He makes for great radio.  Yeah, I think he's funny.  That's what sucks.  I love Rogan.  He's very funny.  I've never said anything  bad about Hammer  or his comedy.  I have no idea  where all this shit comes from.  Where does it...  You don't know  where it comes from?  Honestly, dude, look.  Go to my webpage  and click on my bio  and the first thing  it tells you  is everything  that he laid out  about that shit. 
[02:33:00]  Now, why would somebody  attack somebody  on some shit  that's right there?  I cannot tell you.  The only thing  I've ever been able  to come up with  is jealousy.  No, you've got to put in  it's nedgerbals.com.  Nedgerber, sauerkraut, schnitzel.  I want to go to a Hofbrau now, though.  See if they'll accept me  for the German that I am.  I really do.  Hey, it's October, man.  Oktoberfest is coming  around the corner.  They picked up 
[02:33:30]  Mind of Vinci  for next year, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So you should do  a German thing, man.  That would be hilarious.  See, but it's only...  The whole thing  is like some people  think I'm German.  Well, let's see  what the German culture  is all about.  It's not out there enough.  You know what I mean?  Like, if this was like  a huge, huge thing...  As a matter of fact,  you know what would be great?  I changed my name.  Mitzi was the one  that said,  but if you ever want to hear...  You want to know  why I changed my name?  Actually get a copy  of my first HBO special. 
[02:34:00]  My accent from East LA  was unmistakable  at the time, dude.  I mean, it was so thick  that Ned just did not  apply to the fuck...  There's an actual joke  where I talk about  Jeffrey Dahmer  and I say they didn't  find any penises  in his house  and I said,  you don't eat the dick,  but I quote,  this is exactly  how I said it.  You don't eat the dick!  It's that bad, dude.  I swear to God.  So Mitzi was like,  Ned, what the fuck  kind of name is that? 
[02:34:30]  And I was like,  that's my name  and she's like,  you got to change it  to something more ethnic.  You're way too much  of a beaner.  And so I said,  you know,  my real last name  is Mencia  and I got an uncle  named Carlos.  And that's how it started.  But to be honest with you,  my dream would be  that this gets so huge  that I could actually  change my name  back to Ned  so people would know me  like for my real name.  That will never happen.  That's actually funny though  to be the way you are  and come out and say,  hi, I'm Ned.  I mean,  I think that's hysterical.  Well, now it is 
[02:35:00]  because I'm, you know.  How about Carlos  Mellencamp Mencia?  As, you know,  just to get people  used to it.  Can I get the cougar?  I want cougar first.  I want cougar  and then I'll get rid of,  it'll be Carlos  Ned Cougar Mencia.  Why can't it be cougar  because that's not  Mexican enough?  Chihuahua.  Like, you know,  get a beaner animal  in there.  Well, obviously  there's something going on  that we, like,  I don't know how it started.  You apparently  don't know how it started.  I used to be  really good friends with you. 
[02:35:30]  We used to go  work out together.  We used to hang out together.  And then he started  hanging out with,  at other comedy clubs.  And then,  George,  who fucking hates me.  You know what I mean?  But with George Lopez,  here's a guy  who last week  actually said,  I don't want to see  any Hispanic comedians  succeed except for me.  That's how sick  this fucking thing gets.  Like, he would say  some shit like that.  That made me cry, dude.  I mean,  not because of me personally, 
[02:36:00]  but dude,  when you're the only  fucking beaner  on network television  and there's,  you know,  fucking thousands  of young guys  trying to be you,  there's Pablo Francisco,  there's Gabriel Iglesias,  there's all these young kids  that, you know,  emulate you,  that want to be like you  and you fucking tell them  to their face,  I don't want you to succeed  because you're Hispanic.  That's,  that's fucked up.  It's like the  El Howard O'Sterno  of the Spanish community.  But you guys know  what that's like.  Who, who, who?  Who, who,  Rabino. 
[02:36:30]  They are ripping me off.  Tell them,  Frederico.  Tell them,  Frederico,  would you please  to tell them.  So I don't know  where it comes from.  And I've tried really hard  to be like really cool  and nonchalant about it.  Yeah.  I really have.  But last week  when this,  when we were just talking  about comics  and this guy goes,  oh yeah,  he was in here  a couple months ago  and he said something  bad about you  and I was like,  fuck man.  One other thing he said  was that you were  walking around  watching his act.  Of course, 
[02:37:00]  I watch comics  when I'm at the comedy store.  That's what I do.  But then you had turned it around  as if he was walking around  watching you.  Well, he has to watch my act.  He has to watch my act  or if he doesn't watch my act,  how does he know I steal?  I don't know.  I'm just throwing out  what was said.  That's my point.  He says he's got on video  when you were saying  that he was watching your act  that he actually had left  like really quickly.  He barely saw anything else.  I know he has me on videotape.  And he says,  the reason he says  that you're ripping off  people's acts  is because it's something 
[02:37:30]  that's known  all around the L.A. comedy community.  Whatever.  Quote the joke.  He didn't.  That's it.  He was pissed off in here.  Dude, he was mad.  He grabbed my track too.  He was actually pissed off  this motherfucker.  He actually called me  a fat fuck, I think.  You know what, though?  He's an animal.  Isn't he?  Oh, my God.  That's why I don't want to fuck you.  He's huge, dude.  He'll put you in a...  He'll fucking kick my ass.  You ever seen with that  like extreme fighting shit  and like...  Yeah.  That's why...  He is so scary.  That's why I'm going to take  Joe Rogan's side 
[02:38:00]  because...  You fucking fag.  You fucking fag.  Because I like my life.  No, it's...  It's all right.  But hey,  one full of...  Take Joe Rogan's side  because I like my life  and he might not  pass the test.  I don't know your...  I don't know your fighting resume.  I know his.  But I don't need a fighting resume.  I got...  I got Puerto Rican back up here.  All right, wait.  Well, let me think...  Let me think about this now.  See, right here,  I could say...  Mi gente latina.  Un huero me está jodiendo.  Vengan acá.  I'm telling you... 
[02:38:30]  You just called in an attack.  I'm just telling you right now, dude.  Here, come the low riders.  You guys are going to...  You guys are going to get phone calls.  He's got sleeper cells.  Right now they're going,  Wake up!  Wake up!  Right now,  if you listen closer,  you can hear the click  of a hundred switchblades.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  All right, let's...  Wake up!  We have heard,  finally,  the sound of action!  Here's another clip.  Here's another clip of Joe Rogan. 
[02:39:00]  And then my cameraman  happened to be there  the day Carlos claims  that I was watching him  from the stage.  And instead,  what we have is me on stage  and him watching me,  pacing around the room,  watching me from...  The guy imitates everyone,  including me,  all the time.  He steals from everyone,  whether it's George Lopez  or Paul Mooney  or old Richard Pryor albums.  The guy's a fucking idiot.  And all he does  is rehash other people's shit  or rewrite other people's shit.  You know,  you do a joke about 
[02:39:30]  going to the fucking zoo,  whatever it is.  And if it kills,  he'll do a joke about  going to the zoo  and just rewrite your shit.  He's a weak-minded  fucking simpleton.  And he doesn't know  that people know  he's a weak-minded simpleton.  Hey, it's getting uncomfortable  in the air.  Oh, my God.  That's, by the way,  one of my most  sought-after bits,  my going in the zoo bit.  It's famous  around the country.  No, it really is. 
[02:40:00]  Call people up  and ask them,  hey, what's Carlos'  number one bit?  It's not putting the stocking  over my head  and pulling it back.  It's not the Asian thing  or the whole...  It's when he went  to the zoo.  Holy shit.  That fucking bit  about going to the zoo  was hellacious.  Get the fuck out of here.  The thing that fascinates me  about this whole situation  is it's so personal  that I can't just see this. 
[02:40:30]  Let's get one thing.  I have not talked shit  about the guy.  I've never said anything  personal about him.  I never will.  I don't feel the need  to demean other guys  in our industry.  Fair enough.  I haven't heard you  ever attack the guy personally.  But there is such  this personal thing  that he has  that he's vocalized  toward you.  Right.  Like, wow.  That was very personal.  Yeah.  I don't know what...  Dude, I swear to God,  I don't know what it is. 
[02:41:00]  Yeah.  And by the way,  he'll tell you  that we were at the comedy store  at the same time.  Obviously,  the evidence is there.  He's never come up to me  and said,  Hey, man,  I've got a fucking problem  with you.  You do this.  You do that.  I would address it.  I don't think any comics  do that.  You're all a bunch  of motherfuckers.  No, no.  I actually got an email  from a guy in Boston  that said,  I'm doing this joke  and somebody says,  it's like a joke you did.  And I read the joke  and I said,  no, it's not.  Go ahead and do it.  But the guy sent me an email  because someone said  that's the Adam Ferrara joke.  It was my email.  It was you?  Yeah. 
[02:41:30]  It was my Bob Ross painting bit,  you son of a bitch.  You bastard.  1988.  1988.  1988.  You stole my Bob Ross paint a bit  and gave it to...  I'm sitting on the couch.  And gave it away.  This is a true story, actually.  Why?  There's a little something  going on between these two.  No, we were...  Listen to this.  Oh, really?  This is a great thing.  You're sitting around  one of those afternoons drinking.  Call him a fat fuck.  You fat fuck.  You are a simpleton motherfucker.  My real name is Ned,  you fake Italian.  You pasta-eaten motherfucker. 
[02:42:00]  You really don't like calzones.  Yeah, you're not Latino  and he's not Italian.  Hello.  Tell this story.  Adam Hindenburg, isn't it?  We're just hanging around  and Bob Ross,  we used to watch Bob Ross paint  and he was telling some story one day  and I found it fascinating  about how he paints  these nice happy trees  and scenes now  because he saw a lot of bad things  when he was in Vietnam.  Right.  So, I just got the idea 
[02:42:30]  that it was hysterical  that this guy was in Vietnam  and he's got this little afro  and he's painting happy scenes  and rabbits and stuff  when in the Nam,  he's probably in the shit,  you know,  Charlie in the bushes  and it would be funny  to see him have a Vietnam flashback  as he's painting these things  instead of a happy tree  and there,  we put a little Agent Orange  on the picture  and what's in the tree?  A happy rabbit?  No, that's Charlie.  Okay, now we got to set fire  to the hooch over here  in the corner  and it just kind of  was one of those things  and we were hanging out 
[02:43:00]  and Adam just started  getting rolling in comedy  Still doing open mic nights  and wanted to do the bit  and it was like,  fine, take it.  You know,  where's my outlet?  The Tin Knockers  on the job site  I was going to that day.  So, he takes it  and that was the end of it  until I turn on SNL one night  and who was on there?  What was his name?  No, it was Joey Cola.  Joey Cola.  Yeah.  Was on Saturday Night Live.  He was?  Yeah.  When did Joey do Saturday Night Live?  He was on SNL one night  because I was watching it  and he was one of the 
[02:43:30]  comedy guests that came out.  I think it might have been  one of those nights  they had to throw someone off  and he was like there  so they put him on.  Right.  And I'm watching  and I see Bobby start doing  my bit to a tee.  Not even one of those  it might be the zoo bit,  it might not be the zoo bit,  you know,  your famous zoo bit.  It's incredible.  You've heard it.  Right.  That's amazing.  It wasn't even that.  It was the same lines  and everything  and I'm like,  oh my dear sweet Christ,  he's doing my bit.  So I called up Adam  and I asked him 
[02:44:00]  and you're already laughing  saying,  oh I traded him  for some other bit.  You told me  that you talked to him  and traded him a bit.  No I didn't.  You told me.  What is it?  I'll give you a bit  for a scooter?  Got him, got him,  need him, got him,  need him, need him,  got him.  Sunday night  I should try out the bit.  Joey was up before me  doing a Bob Ross painter bit.  Joey was an established comic.  I was an open mic  and I'm like,  fuck,  I can't do the same premise.  No one's going to believe  that, you know,  no one knows Anthony Cumia  from the couch. 
[02:44:30]  That's right.  So I said,  look,  I got this other bit.  He goes,  do it.  He goes,  well I've been doing this  for a while.  I said,  alright,  because my bit was about  him being in Vietnam  and he goes,  see,  because no one knew  he was in Vietnam.  Well, yeah,  but he was doing  the painter bit  so that's how Joey did it  but I never gave him  the words.  Everyone did a Bob Ross  painter bit  but mine was the idea  of bringing him  to Vietnam.  That's what,  I said,  that's the best part.  You're watching  a 25 year relationship  break up in front of your eyes.  They've been friends 
[02:45:00]  for 25 years.  You fucking ignorant  motherfucker.  Ignorant motherfucker.  Fat fuck simpleton.  You German Nazi cocksucker.  You're not even  really Italian.  You anti-Semitic freak.  You did that  fucking Olive Garden commercial  and you're not  a real Italian.  Yeah.  Hospitaliano,  what does that  even fucking mean?  You were in a band  called As Is  that covered  a Cat Stevens song.  What?  Alright,  now you've gone too far.  Now this is personal.  Now you're gonna  throw down. 
[02:45:30]  What?  What's that  Steven song?  Which one did we cover?  What was that?  Wild World.  Oh god,  that's hilarious.  That was awful.  I wish I had an answer  for you guys.  I really do.  I really do wish  I had an answer  for you guys.  And his other big point,  and this is one  that now I gotta  come out and say  I agree.  I agree with Joe Rogan  on this one.  Yes.  The Punisher.  That wasn't me though.  You absolutely  gave yourself  the name  The Punisher.  No, I did not.  I did not.  Stop it.  Hold on,  let's play the clip. 
[02:46:00]  It's really short.  Okay.  You fucking asshole.  You asshole.  Wait, wait,  we'll get into it.  Here's Joe Rogan.  First of all,  nobody calls that guy  The Punisher.  They call him  The Phony Mexican  or they call him  Carlos Menstilio.  That's all anybody calls him.  If you go to the comedy store,  that's what you hear.  Oh, dude,  The Phony Mexicans here.  Or,  Carlos Menstilio is here.  And what happens?  Everybody gets nervous  because Carlos sits  in the back of the room  with a fucking tape recorder  and watches people's sets.  Wow,  with a tape recorder.  At least give me credit 
[02:46:30]  for learning your shit,  dude.  At least,  come on, guy.  I'm not going to go in there  with a tape recorder.  I'm better than that.  I mean,  I didn't cross the border  by telling them  I'm crossing on this day  at this time.  Wouldn't that be great  if you brought in  a court stenographer  to sit in front of the stage  and just take down  everybody's act?  That would be  fucking hilarious.  No, no, no.  Now,  The Punisher.  Who gave you  the name The Punisher?  It was The Comedians  and it's a fun name  to have  and put on T-shirts 
[02:47:00]  and stuff.  Now,  Joe is saying  that comics  are such self-centered  dickwads.  They don't want anyone  to sound cooler  than they are  or that they  portray them.  Except when you have  a TV show  and you can give them work.  Those are the people  that are calling you  The Punisher?  No, no, no.  I'm saying  once you have a TV show  young comics  don't talk shit  about you anymore.  Like,  I'll give you an example.  There were four comedians  that told me the story  about what happened.  Four comedians  and I called each of them up 
[02:47:30]  and they were like  please don't involve us  in this shit, dude.  Please don't get us  involved in this shit.  Do not mention  my fucking name.  Just fucking  please do not.  You know,  because they're scared  because somebody  can give them a job.  So,  you couldn't get  a young comic  that might think  any comic  could give them  a job to talk shit.  Yeah.  They're going to  you know,  they're going to  shit themselves  in the foot.  No,  I haven't heard  I haven't heard  Carlos Menstelia  and I haven't heard  That wasn't pretty funny  though.  The phony Mexican  is great.  Like,  you're sitting there 
[02:48:00]  with a drawn on  big mustache  and like  one of those  big sombreros  from Sears  like just  everything looks fake.  An inflatable donkey  and I walk on stage  going,  bring the women to me!  I will rip  and pillage  the village!  That's my favorite  is the phony Mexican  poncho on.  But the Punisher  is too cool  a name  for anyone  to have.  But that's why  I put it on  hats and stuff.  You motherfucker.  When they introduced me  the Punisher of comedy 
[02:48:30]  I swear to God  it's the funniest shit ever.  And the hats  the Punisher hats  big sellers  big big money makers  for me.  Do you understand  there was a movie out  and a comic book  named The Punisher?  No, no, no  but it's not The Punisher  it's Punisher  it's not actually protected.  Jesus Christ  are you kidding me?  I swear to God  The Punisher  isn't The Punisher  but Punisher  different.  Son of a bitch.  And I spell it  like a beaner  so there's a couple  of letters missing. 
[02:49:00]  I just cannot  get past the fact  that it's too cool  a nickname.  People give  other people nicknames  stinky  fatso  asshole  douchebag  but Punisher  is like  god damn.  I got hard on  when I heard it.  Yeah?  Yeah, a friend of mine  comes up and goes  dude all those comics  just said you're the Punisher  and I went  I'm stealing that one.  And I pulled out  my tape recorder  and went  Punisher  Oh, there it is  Note to self  refer to self 
[02:49:30]  as Punisher  That's exactly what I did.  Call Hat Company  start production  of merchandise  Find out  what is trademark  It was great, dude.  It was great.  God damn.  I don't know  I wish  I wish  you know what I'm saying  I wish I could  point it out  and I could address it  I wish there was  like a way to say  Hey, this is that  maybe it's the comedy star  You ever watch Fear Factor?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Sometimes  It's a fucked up show  But I hate  Here's what I hate  I hate the fact that 
[02:50:00]  you know  I can't really engage in this  you know what I'm saying  like to a certain point  because it's like  there's no reason for it  but part of me  you know what I mean  part of me does want to  part of me is like  Of course  part of me is like  and then the other part  is like  you know what  my mom always taught me  if you ever put somebody down  and make yourself better  it's because you're not as good  as you think you are  or you want to be  and I just kind of  go back to that  Raised in Switzerland  your mom probably had a lot  of wise saying  Actually  it wasn't Switzerland  it was France 
[02:50:30]  It wasn't France  We were on our way  out of Germany  at the time  Alright  And the boots  were marching behind us  and she said  you know  Carlos come on  we're going to France  they're going to surrender  we'll find a nice home  Exactly  Now the  We'll make some wine  Now the listeners are saying  you did say something bad  about Rogan  Who?  He bashed Rogan  on the Obscure Radio Show  You have the audio  He bashed Rogan  I didn't bash Rogan  I said  he says that I steal  he walks around saying 
[02:51:00]  I'm not Mexican  and then when they  the only thing  that could sound bad  is when they said  why do you think  these comedians do it  and I said  because they're jealous  because I'm funny  because they got nothing on me  that is the only thing  to be construed  but that's me  just hypothesizing upon  why this is going on  because I have no idea  but I never  find the audio  where I say  Joe Rogan sucks  or that Joe Rogan's not funny  or that Joe Rogan's  a piece of shit  find that  because I never said it  well we will cut up  what you just said  and make it sound  like you're saying that  and when Joe Rogan 
[02:51:30]  comes back to New York  you're in trouble  and I know you would  you fucker  and then you'll  mix it in with the painting  and then all of a sudden  I'll be at the zoo  painting little pictures  of Charlie  I was at the zoo  and that's Charlie  and my painting  we might have the audio  I don't know  let's listen to this  from the Frank show  in Arizona  it's true  you're right actually  Frank it was Joe Rogan  to Dennis Leary  and Dennis Leary 
[02:52:00]  actually came out  and called him out on it  and Joe just cowered  why is Joe  all of a sudden  determined that  he's the arbiter of comedy  and he's going to put  everybody in check  what's up with Joe  because he  I don't know man  it's insecurities  it's like look  when I go on stage  okay this weekend  for example  I'm going on stage  with 11 other comics  okay  we're doing 12,000 seats  in LA  20,000 seats  in San Jose, California  right  so we're doing  this huge venue  I'm telling you right now  that from a competitive 
[02:52:30]  standpoint  I want to be  the funniest guy  on that stage  I want to kick  everybody's ass  it's just like  everybody in radio  that does morning radio  they want to be  the funniest show  the most popular show  shut up  it's not about you  but at the end of the night  that doesn't matter  yeah you're right  because it's all about  putting the effort forth  I think the force is  with you Carlos  don't listen to that  Joe Rogan  I don't know  you see what I'm saying  I don't really see the  I never  I haven't heard any  I have not heard  any bad mouthing  no  but I don't  that's my point  and that's why  it's kind of laughable  like what's 
[02:53:00]  I don't know  John from Jersey  hey didn't Sam Kinison  do the Bob Ross  Vietnam bit on HBO  about 18 years ago  I don't know  did you steal it  from him  I came up with it  wait a minute  18 years ago  wait a minute  he stole it  and then accused you  of stealing  you stole it  let me tell you something  you douchebag  unless Sam was at  Bob Ross's taping  of that fucking show  because I was sitting there  when he was doing  the Vietnam episode  when he first brought up  that he was in Vietnam  that bit was fresh  off the griddle 
[02:53:30]  you flipped it over  and turned it  into a pancake  that's right  it was raw batter  it was raw batter  before you got it  let's say hi to Dave  in Philly  Dave what's up  hey guys what's up  we're talking to the punisher  no punisher  the punisher  I'm sorry  Punisher  Punisher in studio  yes go ahead Dave  hey  one of what's strange  about Joe Rogan  is the fact that  he says that 
[02:54:00]  these giant apes exist  and I went online  you know  and did a little  research on it  and he's the type of guy  that leaves everything  he reads online  the Bondo  the Bondo chimp  yeah  yeah the Bondo chimp  and do you want to  what  you know  I look at this incident  here  this Greenham  and I'm on  I really don't feel  that you know  he's doing this shit  and you know  in this Bondo chimp  issue I mean  god I mean who  I mean don't you think 
[02:54:30]  that there would have  been a discovery  you know  he's going off  on the Bondo chimp  thing  well Rogan was in here  and he was talking  about the Bondo chimp  some kind of giant  chimpanzee  yeah yeah yeah  the giant ape  that does body work  to Joe Rogan's defense  he had just finished  the pot lollipop  when he did it  so you know  it might have been  a little iffy  on the facts  they wanted to  defend you  and I don't know  but guys  you know what 
[02:55:00]  this is perfect  because Rogan  got his say  Carlos gets his say  and it's up to  you know whatever  but for all you guys  out there  seriously  that are taking  this shit seriously  you need to get  a fucking life  I'm being very serious  you need to understand  that Carlos Mencia  and Joe Rogan  are fucking  comedians  we tell  fucking jokes  we're not  curing cancer  we're not  uniting the world  we're not getting  Jews and Palestinians  to come together  we're not getting 
[02:55:30]  Puerto Ricans  to stop raping chicks  in Central Park  we're not doing  any of that stuff  we're just telling  fucking jokes  don't take any  of this shit  so seriously  none of it  I'm serious  well  Joe Rogan  he said that  there's a dying chimp  and that's bullshit  it's a fucking joke  it's a fucking joke  it's a fucking joke  the capital of South Dakota  is pure  I am very offended  that you're not playing  German shit  you better go in 
[02:56:00]  archives right now  and find some German shit  get a march  damn it  we'll find a march  see Kyle  I saw Carlos  Mancia  sitting in the back  of the comedy store  singing with his buddies  with big pewter beer signs  rocking them back  and forth in his hand  I saw it  let's go to Steve in Kentucky  the phones are just ridiculous  so we gotta  we just gotta go  that's fine  try to move on  to something else  go ahead Steve  it's all good  go ahead Steve  yeah  Ned 
[02:56:30]  yes  you said you and  this Joe Rogan  used to work out together  yeah a long long time ago  when he first came into town  like in the early 90's  when he did this TV show  called Hardball on Fox  that's like his first TV show  we were actually friends  we'd go work out  I'd hang out at his house  he's a really good pool player  I'm a shitty pool player  but I try  so we used to go hang out before  we were actually  you know  decent friends  yeah well  my question  you know  it sounds to me  like he's got some issues 
[02:57:00]  did you ever date his wife  or his sister  or others  no I never banged  any of his friends  well now that would give him  a viable issue  but if I had  that was  you know  it sounds to me  like he's got some problems  there or something  I mean  hell you comedians  you tell jokes  you know  I drive a truck  and  I hear a joke  that might apply  you know  say like  the  the bikers  or something  and you change it  to a fifth  truck driver 
[02:57:30]  you know  this truck driver  said this  or this  whatever  right  alright  yeah but sometimes  they don't work  you can't say  how do you babysit  a Polish person  you wet their lips  and stick them to the wall  that doesn't work  this is true  let's go to Texas  Mike  what's up  should have went with a Velcro  on the ceiling  and have him jump on the bed  just wanted to tell  El Presidente Mencia  that he misheard them  that he was saying  they were saying  the Pinocher 
[02:58:00]  not  the Punisher  oh that would be funny  see  that's a good  that's a good line  now what is that  here's what it is  Spanish for pussy  Pinocher  is pussy in Spanish  oh so they were  causing you a pussy  so  Pinocher  is a version  of Pinocher  alright  maybe you just  by the way  I don't steal  but you're not  remedian  so fuck you  I'm taking that  you know what  I'd buy a pussy hat  the funny thing is 
[02:58:30]  on the 5 freeway  in between  in between  that's what it says  Pinocher  in between LA  and San Jose  there's actually  a road called  Pinocher Road  and then  Little Pinocher Road  Little Pussy Road  and everybody  that speaks Spanish  just laughs  their fucking ass off  and white people  have no idea  cause it's like  pussy  and Little Pussy Road  it's the funniest  shit ever  I was wondering  if it was  a six lane highway  let's see 
[02:59:00]  a couple more here  Mike in Delaware  Mike  what's up  hey  I have a question  he was on  the other radio show  and talked  with an attitude  about Rogan  he said that  he didn't sit  in the back  of the room  he doesn't  listen to him  Rogan was coming  in and out  listening to his  bitch  I never said  I don't listen  to other comics  I never said that  when I go to the  comedy store  listen  when I go to the  comedy store  like every other comic  I don't know  if you know this  but a comedy store  is where like  comics hang out  and do 15 minutes each 
[02:59:30]  we all hang out  and watch  that's what we do  we're comedians  you know what I mean  so I never said  that I don't watch  I said I don't have  time when I'm doing  50 weeks a year  to go hang out  and try to steal  people's shit  if I wanted to  I've been to the  comedy store  dozens of times  and these guys  are all there  at the same time  waiting to go up  of course you're  sitting there watching  there's nothing else  to do with them  the room's dark  you can't even  play cards or anything  and you're sitting  there watching  and waiting for  the light to go on  so you can go on  next  because let's be honest  comics are pieces  of shit 
[03:00:00]  and we want to go on  and more than anything  you see comics back there  just waiting for that  light to go on  when that light goes on  that's it  that's it  every comics intro  should be  our next act  has a void in his life  he fills with the  adulation of strangers  please welcome  daddy never hugged me  searching for some type  of meaning  in his hard existence  please laugh  or he'll kill himself  he could be German  could be Mexican  we think he's Honduras  we know him is Ned 
[03:00:30]  but it's Carlos Mancia  I was at the zoo  the other day  Flea from Cringe Humor  go ahead Flea  hi Carlos  what's up  I want to preface this  by saying Flea  is on the line here  going put me on the air  with this guy  that's right  I did say that  Carlos  you are unfunny  you're a hack  nobody likes you  from any website  I'm from Cringe Humor  and that's not even the point  wow  nobody likes you 
[03:01:00]  you are unfunny  Flea  what  you can't deny  that the guy is funny  and he's successful  how can you say  no one likes him  no denying that he's successful  but a lot of people  who are unfunny  Comedy Central just picked up  his second season  of Mind of Mencia  he's going to sell out  Caroline's all this weekend  so where does this  no one likes him  no I'm not saying that  you could say  you don't like him  you could say  the gang at CringeHumor.net  doesn't like him  but to say 
[03:01:30]  no one likes him  that's kind of silly  I mean he doesn't even  have to defend that  it's a small niche  on the west coast  that likes him  it is  by the way  I just sold out  I'm selling out  in New York  and I just  I'm already sold out  next week  in Richmond, Virginia  and last week  I sold out  in Charlotte, North Carolina  that is a niche  of the southwest  right  in that area  but that's fine  I never said  you say you're a Spiener  also  you say you're a Spiener  every fucking five minutes 
[03:02:00]  and nobody cares  you say you're a Spiener  I'm trying to help you out  your argument is ridiculous  when you say  no one cares  that's not true  the guy's very successful  he's been for many years  and this Comedy Central show  is blowing up  you can't say  that no one likes him  that's stupid  no it's true  there are people  that like him  but it's that small niche  it is that group  you're going to call  Chris Rock next  and tell him  to stop saying nigga  listen  yeah but at least  when Chris Rock does it  it's funny 
[03:02:30]  but don't  don't listen to me  don't watch my show  I'm not forcing me  down anybody's throat  this is what you guys  don't fucking understand  is that the new  promo Comedy Central  is running from you  you know what  yeah  don't listen to me  the promos were  I think  we gave him a voice  we're getting lawyers  we know people are gonna  half my show  is reading hate mail  if you don't like my shit  don't  but here's the thing  here's the thing  don't fucking  call me a spick 
[03:03:00]  and then pretend  that race isn't an issue  don't fucking come in here  and go  it doesn't matter  fucking spick  obviously it fucking matters  you're racist  and I don't give a shit  that you are  go watch whoever  you want to watch  are you calling me racist  no  somebody earlier called  have you watched  Mind of Mencia  I've seen it once  and I didn't like it  so I don't watch it  that's awesome  that's what you should say  good for you  other people are  yeah but to me  it's just  it's tiresome material  it's back voices  it's not  be nice and just say  it's not your cup of tea 
[03:03:30]  it really isn't my cup of tea  but you know what  it's also not a lot  of other people's  and you know what  it's this  it's just  alright  what is your favorite  comedy show  oh that's a good question  what's my favorite  I actually don't watch TV  but he watched you  once  see this is the kind of shit  I'm talking about  that's why I don't like  responding to this stuff  because it's stupid  yes  go ahead Ryan  hey I had a question  you said that  you know Joe's just  starting shit with you  but when you 
[03:04:00]  went on that radio station  all the stuff you said  was fake  you made all that shit up  the only thing you could say  I made up is a story  that a couple of comics  told me about  you know making  telling him  that's the only thing  everything else  Joe never paced back and forth  in the back of the room  like you said  dude  if Joe never watched me perform  how could he know  that I steal shit  Joe  after that show that night  Joe went right outside  he went back in  for like one minute  you made it sound like  he was pacing back  back and forth  that's why Joe got 
[03:04:30]  probably so upset  that you're just making  up a bunch of shit  and I do know  he watches me  perform  that you stole from  okay  and I'm not going to tell you  who he is  alright  Ryan  you see what I'm fucking saying  and I'm not going to tell you  who it is  I'm surprised it didn't end  with a  this is too much fun 
[03:05:00]  it really is  it's just hilarious  it's hilarious  it's hilarious  and uh  listen  like I said  for all you guys  that want to check  call KBPI  it's a station  in Denver  it's called  the Locker Room Morning Show  and ask them  if Joe hasn't been  saying negative shit  about me stealing  for years  it's just  finally I got pissed off  I finally got pissed off  it was like  you know  I'm tired of this guy  fucking bad mouthing me  every time  somebody says 
[03:05:30]  hey  what do you think  of Carlos Mencia  oh he fucking steals  ask me what I think  of Joe Rogan  what do you think  of Joe Rogan  I think he's a funny guy  personally  he doesn't get along  with me  he's got a problem  with me  I got no problems  with him  but that's boring  that's it  we want to hear you  say something  he just doesn't want  to get in a grapple hole  yeah really  on the stage  of the comedy store  you know what  because if there was  if I really disliked  his comedy  or personal  or something  I would  I really would  yeah  but I don't  I don't hate 
[03:06:00]  on other comics  well obviously  you like his material  it's given you  a good living  for many years  I'm telling you dude  his material  listen  if you had the word  beaner  to his stuff  holy shit  Mexicans eat it up  I'm going to look  forward to the  Azubit  when I come down  to see you  I don't know  what the guy's  problem is  I really don't  look at the  difference in demeanor  I'm laughing  dude he was in here  pissed  and that was after  the pot lollipop  yeah there was a little  pot lollipop  someone is like 
[03:06:30]  yelling at me  on the answer  feedback  the Jew  from Wackback  hey Opie  isn't motherfucking  Howard Stern  popular  we never questioned  his popularity  you ass  we questioned  if he's actually  doing an entertaining  show anymore  see what I mean  we never questioned  Howard Stern's popularity  yeah but I think  that's what the guy's  getting at  is that you can be  popular  and not funny  like you were telling  that guy  look Carlos has a show  he got picked up  blah blah blah  but  you know  he could still 
[03:07:00]  be popular  and what you were  saying is  look he's done  that and that guy's  pointing out Howard  but no  it's different  because Flea's  like saying that  no one finds  Carlos  you know  funny  right that would  be like us  saying no one  finds Howard  entertained  and that would  sound completely  ridiculous  right  we question  how he treats  his own people  fellow employees  it's like saying  everyone thinks  there's a bondo monkey  and we've  we've  we've also  fucking bombing  with the bondo monkey  here  we've also stated 
[03:07:30]  we've also stated  that he's not  trying anymore  you know  he's still  you know  he's still  putting on an  entertaining show  because you know  the numbers show  but we don't think  he's trying anymore  he doesn't give a fuck  he doesn't give a shit  bondo monkey  hangs out with the  chupacabra  oh  and what about  this civilization  I think he's a  fake Jew  Howard  they call him  phony Jew  for Jew  for Jew  all right  we should take a break  yes  do you want to 
[03:08:00]  still hang Carla  yeah sure  and I  I love you guys  I've always loved you guys  I forgive you Adam  and  for trading my  they still have been  eyeing each other  since that  I got a  trading my  I got a blast  from the past  your  your  and a devil dog  producer  was actually in San Jose  at that big theater  thing that we did  yeah  so we were talking  about you the whole time  it was awesome  good old Rick  he's doing alright  I hear  yeah  oh yeah  after he got fired  from here  he's at that station  over  he's got fired  a couple times  he's gotta be a good boy  man  cause they sent him 
[03:08:30]  to the capital  of homosexuals  and Asians  two of his favorite  targets  yeah  I mean believe me  we have more songs  of him bragging  on gay people  and Asians  well he's already  he's already in trouble  with the Asian community  oh yeah  he didn't do anything  and he was in trouble  just for moving there  they just showed up  and they're on  like the websites  going Godzilla's coming  that's how they picture Rick  blowing fire out of his mouth  and stepping on their building  he come fast  he come from  he's coarse  alright Gary Hoey 
[03:09:00]  you should get us out of here  for a while  wait a minute  make sure  GaryHoe.com  before he starts playing  Carlos' tape recorder  is going to interfere  with his amp  so if you could turn off  your tape recorder  I apologize  let me get  stenographer  get out of the room  get out of the goddamn room  we actually had people  we actually had people  email us  saying that you stole  something from us  I'm going to start this  by saying  obviously  that did not happen  remember when you were  in here  yeah yeah  you guys turned me on  to the idea  of the guy that shit  in the uh  and what we did  was we gave him an award 
[03:09:30]  right that's all it was  we gave him a  T-T-T award  for uh  you know  the guy that they found  in the uh  in the port-a-potty  in the port-a-potty  looking at girls  as they were taking dumps  you were here  we had a lot of fun  with that  and then it ended up  on your show  but of course  something like that  should end up  on a comedy show  yeah but  and it was  completely different  we just gave him  an award  I understand  I'm not saying  you did it  it's just  this is how people  think  and they did the story  I think on  Weekend Update  on SNL  and The Daily Show  so it's  it was an AP story 
[03:10:00]  those motherfuckers  stole it from you  fucking stole it  sons of bitches  there are times  that there's just  obvious shit  like uh  Katie Holmes  and Tom Cruise  are having a baby  right  right  so I was watching  uh  Leno and Letterman  last night  they both had  the exact same joke  so who ripped off who  or was it  that the obvious thing  yeah but  Leno's not really Mexican  that's true  he's not  nope  he's a German  that was the only  timely joke  Letterman had  and then he's talking  about crime  in New York City  and rats  it's like  Jesus dude  wasn't Carson  doing those jokes 
[03:10:30]  before he went out  to LA  it's like  it's like  those are old  New York bits  get out of your compound  and walk around a while  and see what's going on  in New York  well you won't hear  the comics  you won't hear  either of these comics  Bash and Letterman  it's okay  I'm just  I'll  you know  whatever  Bash Letterman  what did I say  what did I say  what did I say earlier  you won't get  young guys  to talk shit  about me  you won't get me  to talk shit  about Letterman  he still refers  to hookers  hanging out  in Times Square  it's like  have you been  down there  in the last decade  yeah it's clean  there's not a hint 
[03:11:00]  of a hooker  down there anymore  it's a shame  I couldn't find one  last night  anywhere  it's crazy  where are they  where are the hookers at  it's surprising to me  that he obviously  has writers  he has writers  around him  you would think  they would  be brave enough  to go  Dave the hookers  they're not there anymore  he had a great  mayor  he should hire  my writers  dude  my writers  holy shit  when they write  something that's funny  they do not  fucking let it go  I mean  I had to say  a couple times 
[03:11:30]  like right before  we taped  guys  we need to  write a different  fucking joke  for that  but it's funny  well  when you have  the show  of Luckner  you know  the mind  of Luckner  you can put it  on your fucking show  but it's a  mind of Mencia  we need a different  joke  these guys  oh my god  they like  they cling to that shit  really funny guys  of pounding  something on the ground  it's this program  right here  speaking of which  Mike from California  go ahead Mike  hey you guys  are fucking great 
[03:12:00]  you are blown up  out here in California  I put XM  in all my work trucks  and I won't hire  a fucking guy  unless we listen  to your fucking show  thank you  you fucking fuck  isn't that comedy  you gotta say  the fucking F word  yeah that's right  yeah  you used to be  a fucking Stern fan  started listening  to you guys  the guy's just  not funny anymore  Mencia  I've never listened  to you man  I gotta be honest  but you haven't  been very funny  on the show today  and guys  I gotta call you out  you haven't played  all the radio clips  of him talking shit 
[03:12:30]  about Rogan  about how Rogan  was standing backstage  you know  he said that shit  you guys should play that  just to be fair  you know  I think Joe's a funny guy  and you know  if I had to go to war  obviously  who do you want  on your side  right  so oh yeah  real war  with fighting and violence  seriously  if there's a real war  you want me  cause I got much more  backup  much more backup  I think Joe  can take him  single handedly  Nazis or Spix man  huh?  Nazis or Spix  yeah the Beaners  I'm telling you 
[03:13:00]  Nazis and Spix  that's a good combination  yeah that's who you want  dude  that's who Carl's  is going to bring  to the fight  Mike here's the deal  that's right  Beanerschnitzels  Mike we could  we could go on  we could go on  for hours  what are we supposed  to do  replay Joe Rogan's  entire appearance  hold on  that's what  that's what I was  going to say  we did tell Joe  that Carl's  was coming in  because when that  was all going down  lucky us  we're like  whoa  Carl's is coming in  within a week  or ten days  of that appearance  I forget  probably a little  over a week  so I said 
[03:13:30]  Joe you got the  hotline  get a Berlin call  if you want  if it's a big deal  I think we did  a good enough job  like confronting  Ned  Punisher  and you know  we played  we played some  highlights  and we  we asked  you know  we asked  Anthony  asked some  tough questions  but every question  I wasn't going to ask  everything was answered  yeah  how far do you want  us to go with this  if Joe Rogan  cares that much  he'd call our show  and go at it  with them  I don't know  what to tell you  thank you sir  looking for you 
[03:14:00]  at the Yankee game  we got you  last night  out here in Cali  yeah well  it's all tied up  back to the stadium  we'll see how it goes  alright guys  I'll be listening  thanks a lot  alright Mike  bye  you had that little  friggin  Chinese guy  on the mound  last night  right  it's weird  because you know  now it looks like  we're picking sides  because now we got  Carlson here  we did the best we can  and then when Joe  shows up next time  we'll kiss his ass  and make you look stupid  so I am not gonna  I'm just fucking with you  you don't understand  this is radio

[03:15:00]  it's like  I haven't done any material  you know what I mean  we haven't done  like the normal type  of interview  where you guys  ask me some shit  and then I go off  on Hurricane Katrina  victims  and all that kind of stuff  you know  some hurricane material  please  please  but that's my point  so I haven't done  any of that  so people that have  never heard me  are like  fuck man  there's nothing funny  about what's going on  in there  so they're judging me  by that  but I don't give a shit  hold on  Gary Hoey  what's your latest album  the new album's called  Monster Surf

[03:19:00]  Sunday.  And Rick wants in.  Rick, go ahead.  Hey, Carlos.  You might look at his eyes a little closer.  He might be wearing a brown contact.  Are you wearing brown contact, sir?  You motherfucker.  You son of a bitch.  How did you find that out?  How did you find that out?  Hovering up that blonde hair with the hair dye, too.  God damn.  That would be great.  I love the show.  All right.  Thank you. 
[03:19:30]  Oh, man.  Let's say hi to Doug in Tennessee.  Doug, what's up?  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Hey, man.  Hey, I just want to say I've been listening to Opie and Anthony's show for a couple months  now, and I love it.  I quit listening to Man Cow.  But anyway, I just want to tell Carlos that I love your work, man, and your little thing  on Mind and Mencia about the Army.  I'm a white guy, and I was in the Airborne, dude.  Oh, that's right.  That was that bit?  I don't think I saw that one.  Well, it's this whole bit about how, like, it started, everything starts off with somebody 
[03:20:00]  telling me some shit.  So this guy came up to me once after a show, after I did some Middle Eastern stuff, and  he was like, you should be careful, be doing jokes about those people, you know, they're  crazy.  And I'm, like, trying to say, are you crazy?  Yeah.  Are you trying to tell me you're fucking crazy?  And he's like, I'm just saying, you know, we're crazy people.  And I was like, dude.  Obviously.  I go, I'm an American.  We're fucking crazy.  You guys aren't crazy.  Maybe other Americans are afraid of you.  I'm not a pussy American.  I ain't fucking afraid of you.  And he goes, well, you know, we fucked up two of your buildings. 
[03:20:30]  And I go, and we fucked up two of your countries.  You want to play this fucking game?  Let's keep going, bitch.  We're fucking crazy.  You know, we might get an atomic weapon.  We do have them.  And we have used it.  We're the only fucking country to drop nukes on another one.  You don't know shit.  I'm fucking crazy.  Plus, you don't want to mess with a country that has the mixed that we have.  You know, we have crazy white guys.  That's who jumps out of fucking planes.  Blacks and beaters, we will not jump out of a fucking plane.  But white dudes, X games, bitch.  You guys will fucking do it. 
[03:21:00]  Black guys drive our tanks.  I don't know if you know this.  Racially speaking, more black guys drive tanks than any other race.  And our hit-to-kill ratio is 75 to 1.  Yeah, but the tanks all have rims on them.  Exactly.  Spinners.  What is it?  It does drive bikes.  That's why we're so good at this shit.  You see what I'm saying?  Now, here's the interesting thing.  Hispanics get the shittiest grades in America.  The easiest branch of the military to get into is actually the army, which you would  think there are more people of Hispanic descent in the army, but there's not. 
[03:21:30]  There's more people of Hispanic descent in the Marine Corps, and that's because they're  the first to always fight.  So when we got to go kick...  Knife fighting, baby.  So when we have to go kick Iraq's ass, then we get a phone call from Iran and Pakistan,  right, who border the country on the east, west, and south, and they say, you can fly  over our airspace, but you cannot step on our ground to inject troops to kill our Muslim  brothers.  That's when the president can call the Bina Marines and say, can you guys cross the border  without being seen? 
[03:22:00]  And it's not that long a trip from Tijuana to Pendleton.  That's a pretty quick little job.  Pendleton is just like 30 miles away from the border.  It's a...  Man, people that haven't lived in California, in Southern California, because I used to  live...  I lived in San Juan Capistrano for...  Where the birds fly.  Yeah.  The swallows come back every year.  Blah, blah, blah.  And...  Swallows come back and Anthony shoots them.  Yeah.  Shoot them, bastards.  And people don't realize... 
[03:22:30]  I don't know if they still do it.  The artillery practice.  Yes.  Where at night, you'll just hear...  Yeah.  You'll hear bombs going off.  Yeah.  Over the hills.  It's badass, right?  You'd think it's thunder at first when I first moved out there and then...  I like when they do the amphibious training.  That's badass.  Yeah.  When they have the boats that turn into cars.  Yeah, yeah.  That's some shit right there, dude.  It's great stuff to watch.  And then you hear them just blowing shit up all the time.  That's badass.  Yeah.  All right.  Now we got to go back to the phones. 
[03:23:00]  The reaction we're getting today is unbelievable.  Unbelievable.  A lot of positive, negative as well.  Jose, go ahead.  Yeah, hello?  Yeah, go ahead.  Hey, man.  How the fuck does this motherfucker say he's an American and he didn't even pass a citizenship test?  Wait, wait, wait.  I did pass the test.  I just didn't go swear in.  Hey, come on, asshole.  You're not an American.  Shut the fuck up.  Bye, guys.  Wait a minute.  But because you didn't swear in, now you got to take the test again?  I have to do everything all over again.  I even have to take the picture again. 
[03:23:30]  And now the pictures are really weird because it's in September 11th.  So you actually have to, like, show both ears and certain angles of your face so that they can scan it and digitally...  Wow.  Oh, yeah, dude.  It's creepy.  Pretty strict.  Yeah, it's creepy.  Hey, you know something?  Good.  I don't have to do it.  So fuck them.  Good.  I want everything.  I want UPC codes tattooed on your foreheads so the cop can just pull you over and go, blip, scan you like a grocery item. 
[03:24:00]  No, but they should do that now.  And everything will pop up.  It should be...  I should have that now.  When you become an American citizen, they should drop that shit.  Yeah.  Like now, like if you want to become a resident, that's when they should put barcodes and all kinds of creepy shit.  I love the idea of a barcode being on people.  I like it on the hand so the cop could just be there and go, all right, put your hand out the window.  And from his car, he could just, blip, all right, you can go.  No danger again.  Shot, nothing.  But you know those scanners never work.  The cop's going to be in the back going, I need the key. 
[03:24:30]  I need the key.  Crime check on the Negro in the Chevy.  I need a crime check.  Let's say hi to a barcode.  That'd be funny.  You know that wetbacks wouldn't give a shit.  You know that, right?  You know that if you went anywhere south of the border and you said, hey, we'll let you in, but you've got to put a barcode on.  Yeah.  It's like barcodes.  Oh, they're barcoding their asses.  I said do it myself.  That's right.  I know.  Where do you want it?  All right.  Let's go to Albert in Texas.  Albert.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  How are you guys doing?  All right, Albert. 
[03:25:00]  I also want to say what's up to Adam.  I think he's a funny dude, too.  Thanks, brother.  As far as all these other guys dogging Carlos, man, you know what, Carlos?  I get that shit out here, too, man.  I mean, I own my own car.  He's got a big old black leader belt.  And there's some guys that just can't see another dude succeed.  Before I start listening to ONA, I used to listen to XM Comedy.  I've never heard Carlos say a joke that was repeated from, you know, from another comic book.  You know, I see you, Carlos, every time you come to El Paso, you hick-ass. 
[03:25:30]  They never miss the show.  That fake joke, America TV is the fucking best.  I've heard it in a long time.  I love that CD, without a doubt.  But, you know, I mean...  I think my favorite is America Rules, dude.  If you're a Carlos fan, you've got to get that album, America Rules.  Well, now I've got to see the covers of your albums, because there's one I really enjoyed a lot.  America Rules...  Maybe it was America Rules.  ...was recorded 11 days after September 11th.  And I wrote every single one of those jokes within three days, and then recorded that album. 
[03:26:00]  It is so fucking raw.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like, I listen to it now and go, oh...  Yeah, ooh.  Ooh, there's...  You know what I mean?  It was funny.  Yeah.  But because the audience was pissed...  Oh, I liked Take a Joke America.  I doubt it.  Yeah.  They let me get away with your shit.  Wow.  Yeah, it was crazy, dude.  I want to get into the battle one of these days between Adam and Brian Regan, because I  hear that's hot and heavy.  Both of you nasty potty now.  I heard about that one.  You know why?  He's a Cuban. 
[03:26:30]  Jack in Kansas.  Go ahead, Jack.  Hey, what's up?  Carlos, you're badass, man.  I'm a big fan.  I appreciate that, man.  I was just in Kansas.  Oh, yeah?  Cool.  Up in Lawrence at the University of Kansas.  All right.  I got to point out something there.  That's a niche in the Southwest.  Why is it that all the guys sticking up for you all have the same accent?  Beaners?  They all have the same accent on the phones.  Jack, what did I tell you earlier?  Jack, what's your nationality?  I got a backup, bitch.  It's fine, man.  Mexican.  I want one.  Mexican, huh?  I want one, just one white dude to stick up for Carlos. 
[03:27:00]  One white guy did from the South.  Isn't he a little far north for...  Yeah.  Kansas?  Kansas.  What the fuck is...  Dude, you were supposed to stop in, like, Oklahoma.  No, he was supposed to stop in Texas.  Texas?  He just went one state further and went, I'm sure immigration isn't coming this far.  If you hit Kansas, they let you go.  They let you go.  Kansas or bus.  Doug in Nebraska.  Hey, Carlos, I love your stuff, man.  Rogan sucks. 
[03:27:30]  Rogan is good for one thing.  He makes me turn the radio off whenever he comes on.  Maybe he's just pissed because you actually have a comedy show,  and he has to watch people eating fucking intestines.  And what's your nationality, Doug?  Uh, I'm a big, fat white guy.  Well, here's something...  I'm a big, fat white guy.  Here's something a little different. 
[03:28:00]  Wizard, he loves to beaner, but wants to give him shit, so he earns it.  So let's go to the wizard.  I'm a love?  Wizard.  Yo, man, what's up, beaner?  What's up, bro?  Hey, bro.  Wait, are you a cracker?  Fuck no, man.  I'm a truck driver, I say.  Is it Grand Wizard?  No, no, no.  I ain't that damn good.  They just call me Wizard.  One and the only.  Are you Rubber Ducky?  We got ourselves a con boy.  Get that girl up in front of me.  I guarantee that duck will squeal. 
[03:28:30]  Here's something, Wizard.  Is that your call name?  Hey, Wizard, is that your call name on the CB, seriously?  Yeah, man, Wizard 221, United States Nation on 18 wheels, brother.  Holy shit.  They get on the radio and go, hey, Wizard 221.  We got the wizard.  We're 10-10, 10-8 on the side.  Keep her between the ditches.  You shake the trees, I'll rake the leaves, good buddy.  We got some pretty seat covers out here. 
[03:29:00]  Just look out for the Kojak with the Kodak.  Say, yell into that and say, we got ourselves a con boy.  You got you a con boy there, Wizard?  Con boy.  You can't call it a con boy anymore, man.  They'll bust your ass.  It's against the law.  You know what we call it now?  Like now I'm in Illinois.  We call it the choo-choo train, motherfuckers.  Choo-choo train.  The choo-choo train.  Puerto Ricans call it that, too, but it's referring to something different.  We love you. 
[03:29:30]  We love you out here.  All right, Wizard, are you done?  I'm done, bro.  Let's be cool.  All right, man.  So what do you got on the Hurricane Katrina?  We can't call it a con boy no more.  It's against the law.  Against the law.  How is that the choo-choo?  How do you go from con boy to...  You're a fucking truck driver.  You can't say choo-choo, dude.  No.  You can't say choo-choo if you're a truck driver.  I can't see Chris Christopherson starring in choo-choo.  Doesn't really work. 
[03:30:00]  Mercy sakes and I have we got us a choo-choo.  A choo-choo.  Won't you join up on our choo-choo?  Yeah.  Won't you slide right in our choo-choo bandit?  We're gonna do what they say can't be done.  I'm running block for a choo-choo.  I love that this song says we're gonna do what they say can't be done.  Yeah.  A bunch of trucks can't get on the road and ride in the same direction.  Who fucking said that?  What was the prank?  You can't...  I bet you you can't get a bunch of trucks in a row going in the same direction. 
[03:30:30]  What the hell?  I bet you can't.  What is that?  Stonehenge?  What is that?  You can't cross the yellow lines.  A flying machine?  That's preposterous.  What the fuck?  We only birds have wings.  Only birds have wings.  God wanted us to fly.  He'd have given us wings.  They had a long way to go and a short time to get there.  That's the...  Hey, you can't drive fast and get there quicker. 
[03:31:00]  That's bullshit.  They had to work together.  Right.  Can't do it?  Not unless it's downhill.  That's what it was about.  Rubber ducky.  I noticed we had a phone call on the line.  I'm just worried for his safety.  Is he going to shoot himself?  Jim Norton?  I don't know.  I'm calling him after the show.  Jimmy called.  His name was on the phone thing.  And just to think, we don't have time for you, Jimmy. 
[03:31:30]  No, that's not it at all.  He's going to jump out a fucking building.  We're just in the middle of a whole bunch of stuff.  That's all.  Yeah, I know.  I miss...  By the way, I miss you, Jimmy.  I miss you.  Last time he was here.  We all miss our little Jimmy Norton.  Jimmy comes back Tuesday for a few days, and then he goes back out to Hollywood.  He's filming an HBO series.  Hollywood.  Oh, he's doing a half-hour special?  No, that airs October 21st.  Okay.  He's doing the Louis CK.  The Louis CK?  Is he like a regular cast member on the show?  Yeah, he is.  Fucking it.  Good for him, man.  Yeah.  I've heard nothing but great things about that show. 
[03:32:00]  So we lost Jimmy for like three or four months.  He's coming and going.  He comes back for a few days, and then he goes back out for a couple of weeks.  And we have people fill in.  Jimmy's fucking funny.  Adam Farr, who's playing Rascals in Montclair.  Montclair, starting tonight, right?  Tonight, Thursday through Sunday.  So the Hurricane Katrina thing, not to set you up, but some observations.  Well, they didn't let me say some shit on Comedy Central, which pissed me off.  I don't doubt it.  They didn't let me say, well, what I wanted to talk about, I want to talk about those stupid  fucking people that they actually sent buses to the ghetto to pick up, but they didn't 
[03:32:30]  get on the bus.  Yeah.  And of course, because they were black, people were like, well, you can't, you know, some  of those people died.  And I'm like, what the fuck?  They sent buses to pick them up.  And they asked these people, why didn't you get on?  And they were like, well, where were we going to go?  Motherfucker, away from the hurricane, bitch.  How about that shit?  Just leave the area.  Just get the fuck out.  Do you know that there's a huge Honduran and Mexican population in New Orleans?  They must have left.  Exactly.  Because I saw none of them.  None.  They sent one fucking bus and we all got on it. 
[03:33:00]  One goddamn bus.  And they said, we're taking you to Mexico.  And they said, we don't give a fuck.  Is Hurricane going to Mexico?  No?  Vámonos a Mexico!  Fucking idiots.  I didn't see one Honduran dangling from a helicopter in that whole, every bit of coverage  I watched.  This is fucking unbelievable, these people.  You gotta feel sorry for them.  Motherfucker.  And then they try to equate it.  Well, you live in Southern California where they have earthquakes.  Yeah, but we wake up one day and shit's shaking.  They don't tell us for a whole fucking week on the news. 
[03:33:30]  Hey, you see that giant fucking cloud down there?  The one so big it's got a fucking name?  By the way, you guys live below sea level, surrounded by water.  You're basically a bowl and guess what's coming?  Soup.  Get the fuck out!  No, we're just staying, hang out, see what happens.  I was blown away when I heard the hospitals are losing power.  Right?  Auxiliary power.  They actually don't have fucking codes there.  Like in California, we have codes, right? 
[03:34:00]  You gotta build structures big enough.  When they're big, you gotta put springs underneath.  Because there's fucking earthquakes.  These people live below sea level.  They're surrounded by fucking dikes.  And they put their fucking generators in the basement.  In the basement, right.  I have nothing.  I got nothing else.  The fucking basement.  I guess it should be on the roof.  Yeah.  Well, not one person said, hey, maybe we ought to put a code in there.  Nothing.  Fucking people.  I wasn't sure if you wanted me to jump in and say,  I guess it should be on the roof. 
[03:34:30]  You could.  No, that's it.  I mean, you could draw your own fucking conclusions.  It's un-fucking-believable.  And then they shoot at the fucking helicopters.  And then they go,  Why a motherfucker ain't picking a nigga up?  Don't shoot the fucking helicopters.  The fuck you guys doing?  Oh, is it because I'm black?  It's because you got a gun, motherfucker.  I don't care that you're black.  Holy shit.  Who cares?  Get the fuck out.  Oh, man.  And now all of a sudden, you know, that city needs to be rebuilt.  Who's going to rebuild it?  Black people ain't coming back.  That's your place that's going to turn into little fucking Mexico. 
[03:35:00]  You think?  Who's going to fucking build it?  I swear to God, this is a true story.  I know it sounds fucked up, but it's true.  So, my friend, he took pictures of this shit, and he actually took a video camera to the stadium in Houston.  All right?  Remember when that big deal was going down when they were giving out $2,500 gift cards?  Oh, yeah.  We know what you're going to say.  Go ahead.  They actually had contractors, big contracting companies that won bids to rebuild shit in New Orleans. 
[03:35:30]  He took a picture of both lines at the same time.  The fucking contractors line had two people in it.  Two fucking people.  And they were both beaners.  They weren't even the fucking black people in the other shit.  Two people just trying to get some work.  Two beaners just like, you know, you're going to rebuild?  Let's go.  And everybody else.  Two guys seeing an opportunity, and the rest getting their free credit card.  Where's my money?  Their free credit card.  Holy shit.  It's un-fucking-believable.  And Comedy Central was like, you can't say that stuff. 
[03:36:00]  Some of the people died.  I'm like, some people should fucking die.  They're retarded.  You know, because it's only because they, you know what I mean?  Because they tell them, hey, a hurricane's coming.  I bet you if they told them a big-ass black nigga with a 12-inch dick is going to come and fuck you and your family in the ass in three days.  I bet you they'd get the fuck out.  A hurricane's the only thing that you get advance notice for.  And they still die.  And you still, for anyone to die like that in a hurricane is completely ridiculous.  You have advance notice that it's coming. 
[03:36:30]  It's not like an earthquake.  Tornadoes just spring up out of nowhere.  And it's got a name.  You guys get hit by blizzards.  When's the last time you got hit by a blizzard called Alberto?  When's the last time that shit happened?  See, it's political correctness.  They should give these hurricanes fucked up names.  You know what I mean?  That scare people.  That make people go, holy shit.  Katrina didn't really.  Katrina, not fucking scary.  Didn't scare me.  Scary-ass Puerto Rican with a knife.  That might make a motherfucker get out.  You see what I'm saying?  Something scary. 
[03:37:00]  Something creepy.  Yeah.  Oh, you can't say that.  People died, Carlos.  People are fucking stupid.  There's a place called Tornado Alley and people live there.  Yeah.  There's not...  You don't even need a joke for that.  It's a fucking Tornado Alley.  And they're still surprised.  I can't believe I got hit by a term lighter.  And people will just...  They'll move right back into New Orleans.  They won't do anything to make it any safer.  They can't lift it above sea level.  And they'll rebuild.  And people will move in their businesses and houses again.  And over time...  It might take a hundred years. 
[03:37:30]  It's open now.  Yeah.  The French Quarter.  Yeah.  But I mean, they'll rebuild it all.  Well, they made a big deal about the first strip club reopening.  We need our tits.  Oh, yeah.  We need our tits.  Sure.  That's very important.  They're dancing back...  The titties are back.  Yeah, the titties are back.  Yes.  And they'll be a Mardi Gras.  Please welcome to the main stage, Katrina.  Yeah.  I mean, Katrina is going to be stripping there.  Carlos, that's going to be the new big name, Katrina.  Yeah.  I got a quick question for you.  So you're doing the show on Comedy Central.  Mind and Mencia, they picked up the second season.  Yeah.  Congratulations.  Thanks, man.  But you just brought up something that was very interesting. 
[03:38:00]  Doesn't it get frustrating when you know there's material that will kill on the TV show?  Like this Hurricane Katrina stuff.  Yeah.  And they're saying, dude, you just can't do that because people died.  Right.  Isn't that frustrating?  Yeah.  Because that's the shit we went through.  Fuck the FCC.  That's some of the shit we went through on commercial radio.  Right.  Right.  Now we're on satellite.  The freedom we have to just pretty much let it fly is unbelievable.  Beautiful, right?  Yeah.  How do you deal with that?  Well, we did see, like, we got around it by saying, I think I did some of the material,  but I said something like, I'm not talking about the people that died or the sick people. 
[03:38:30]  I'm talking about the people that could get out.  Right.  You got to, like, preface it by saying that.  Yeah.  I mean, it's still edgy for TV.  But there's probably also other stuff that you know would just kill.  Yeah.  You know, you're a creative guy, a funny guy, and they're saying, nah, because of some stupid  reason.  Most of the stuff that they've not let us get away with, believe it or not, is shit  that you'd be like, you got to be kidding me.  That's what they chose to fight about?  Let me think of one.  Oh, here's an example. 
[03:39:00]  You guys were talking earlier about the mariachis.  Yeah.  We did this piece where I was a mariachi guy, and I was singing really fucking obnoxious  songs to people.  You know, so there was a couple, and they were, we're just friends.  He wants to fuck you.  He wants to fuck you.  You know what I mean?  Shit like that.  And there was this Asian group, and they were celebrating Chinese New Year at a Mexican  restaurant.  Yeah.  So there was this stupid, there's this all stupid song about what are you doing celebrating  fucking Chinese New Year at a Mexican restaurant, blah, blah, blah.  And then there was the tag, and the tag was, come back when it's Cinco de Mayo. 
[03:39:30]  And they actually didn't let us say that.  You couldn't say Cinco de Mayo.  They bleeped Cinco de Mayo.  Meanwhile, I said Beaner and Wetback 32 times on that episode.  Well, because you're a Beaner.  Because you can say it.  An Asian guy would be able to get away with things.  That's the stupidest rule in comedy.  You're allowed to say it because you're one of them.  I hate that rule.  Yeah, but then we did a piece called...  That's why Whitey gets so gypped.  But we did a piece called Nigger, Nigga, and they didn't beat that. 
[03:40:00]  But Cinco de Mayo, that's where they drew the line.  All right.  With that, we've got to say goodbye to Carlos Macias.  He's playing Caroline's all this weekend.  Very funny guy.  I've seen many Carlos shows, and I enjoy it every time because you change up your material.  Caroline's, the number here in New York City, 212-757-4100.  Carlos, thank you so much.  Love you guys.  Love the show.  Thanks, man.  Gary Hoey, the name of the new CD?  Lots to surf in stores now.  Enjoy Asia, all right, my friend?  Thanks, bro.  Play us out of here.  All right. 
[03:40:30]  Adam?  Oh, I'm at Rascals in Montclair tonight through Sunday.  Sorry about that, Adam.  I know we're going to see you tomorrow.  That's the only reason.  I'm sorry.  All right.  Gary, playing live.  Hit us.  All right, man.  We'll be right back. 
[03:41:00]  We'll be right back. 
[03:41:30]  We'll be right back. </pre>
