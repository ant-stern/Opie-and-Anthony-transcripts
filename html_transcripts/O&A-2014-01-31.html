<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a discussion about the upcoming Super Bowl and the hosts' plans for the following Monday, focusing on Opie's potential for excessive alcohol consumption.  This segued into a bizarre story about a toenails bet and comedian Gino Biscotti, who famously travels with a monkey.  The hosts reminisced about past road trips, including a frantic search for Biscotti's missing monkey in Cleveland, and briefly debated San Francisco's reputation as a gay-friendly city.  Audio clips were then played from a field reporter, Sal, who conducted Super Bowl-themed interviews in Times Square with a diverse group of people – a biker, a leprechaun, and a very tall, intimidating man – featuring awkwardly phrased questions about the perceived "gayness" of football fans, eliciting uncomfortable and humorous responses.

Joe Rogan and Tom Segura joined the show in studio.  Their conversation initially revolved around their experiences with Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and his publicist, followed by Rogan's recounting of his fighter jet experience, including the intense G-force and near blackout.  Rogan then discussed his desensitization to violence from his UFC announcing work and shared a graphic story about excessive vomiting at a past show.  He and Opie compared the gruesome aspects of online videos to reality TV, noting the differences in media consumption across generations.  The discussion then turned to the shared experiences and traits of comedians, focusing on the challenges and adversities that shape their comedic styles.  Anecdotes about difficult childhoods, comedic camaraderie, and the differences between successful and unsuccessful comedians were shared.  The hosts and Rogan debated a UK article claiming many comedians are psychologically damaged, and contrasted the freedoms of podcasting with the limitations of traditional radio due to censorship. Rogan’s concise comedic style was highlighted, along with his observations about other comedians.

The conversation shifted to Deepak Chopra, his son, and their relationship, touching upon Chopra's self-proclaimed enlightenment and Cara Santa Maria’s critical perspective. The hosts shared personal experiences with religion, Catholic school, and the scandals surrounding the Catholic Church, specifically regarding child molestation, leading to a broader discussion about power, corruption, and the Church's history.  Bruce Buffer then joined the show, promoting his book and discussing his background in fighting and poker, including anecdotes about high-stakes games and a memorable hand involving quad eights.  The hosts discussed the book "Going Clear" about Scientology, sharing personal experiences and discussing rumors about Richard Gere.  The conversation returned to comedians and the differences between the New York and Boston comedy scenes, including a recollection of a particularly bad Pauly Shore performance.  The entire conversation was liberally peppered with vulgar and offensive language.

A large portion of the show focused on the impact of FCC regulations and the changing media landscape. The hosts discussed their experiences with swearing on air and the hefty fines they incurred, contrasting the massive viewership of shows like the Beatles on Ed Sullivan with current TV ratings.  Bruce Buffer further detailed his astonishing late discovery of his famous brother, Michael Buffer, and the lucrative business built around the "Let's Get Ready to Rumble" trademark, including legal battles with infringers like Don Imus. Ricky Gervais then joined, discussing his TV experiences, his views on the decline of late-night TV and the rise of online content, his dislike of Jay Leno, social media outrage, and the importance of context in comedy. He shared anecdotes about car accidents and animal activism.  The conversation again included frequent profanity and discussions of adult topics, including the use of derogatory terms. Joe Rogan remained present throughout this segment.

The final segment focused on human-animal relationships.  The conversation began with anecdotes about cats and a grandmother's pet monkey described with extremely offensive terms, which led to a discussion about dangerous animals, including a chimpanzee attack resulting in a face transplant and the ethics of euthanizing attacking animals.  The ethics of hunting, particularly trophy hunting (with the killing of a lion as an example), were discussed, contrasting it with hunting for sustenance.  The discussion also covered the cruelty of keeping orcas in captivity (referencing *Blackfish*), the ethics of zoos and breeding programs, and humorous scenarios involving absurd hunting attempts. Marlon Brando's eccentricities during filming were recounted, followed by a discussion about the hypocrisy of human treatment of animals, contrasting pet care with the treatment of animals raised for food.  The hosts shared personal experiences with animals, including a man's experiences with wolves and chickens, and the segment ended with a comparison of the bite force of a wolf, a pit bull, and a story of a pit bull killing nine attacking coyotes.

[00:15:30]  was not a midget and apparently he's one of those like cheerleaders not a cheerleader but like the  fireman or whatever right jets and so he's a denver bronco leprechaun but he also had like a what  appeared to be a fairly obvious cold sore honestly did you ask him about it no i know i should have but  but my favorite part is if you listen to this yeah sal he he is trying to get him out of character he 
[00:16:00]  won't drop the leprechaun character oh no until the the very end sal gets him out of leprechaun oh  okay let's listen to this all right i'm sal here with rocky the colorado leprechaun how you doing  today oh it's wonderful it's wonderful here in times square and i tell you what it's a beautiful  beautiful day lots of people out having fun now this might be a silly question but uh who do you  want to win the super bowl well you know silly is my business in a leprechaun that's what we do  for applause now they're wearing orange on the bottom that's correct no he i don't know the 
[00:16:30]  reason he's the pause there is because when he says that normally he has to duck a punch  silly is my business duck put hands up defensively silly is his business oh my god that would only be  fun if he worked as a mortician to cheer people up silly is my business toe tag right bottoms correct  and i don't know what they're wearing underneath those uh uniforms but uh if they're wearing 
[00:17:00]  orange bottoms it would be great with me now how delicious is uh painted man i've never nibbled on  him but he seems to be a sweet man a sweet man if you tasted him i don't know i'm not that kind of  fairy oh okay how gay do you have to be to watch the uh super bowl i don't know anything about that  i don't know anything about that scram fag they're just he was everyone's but he no longer was a 
[00:17:30]  leprechaun right there no i'm silly as me business fun fun fun gay go fuck yourself  man there's a photo of him on ona show on twitter right now oh that's that's how he dresses that's  it he's walking around silly is his business huh unless you're talking about gay stuff right i don't  know anything about that then he becomes deadly serious right one more sal talks to peter this peter 
[00:18:00]  peter was one of my favorites is that the euphemism that you're using now sal's talking to peter  very closely yeah a microphone peter was probably seven feet tall seven feet tall had a big giant  beard on him and didn't seem to have a sense of humor just like he wasn't smiling walking around  wow so we figure that's perfect for an interview with sure yeah all right we're here at super bowl 
[00:18:30]  boulevard i'm here with peter how you doing today peter i'm all right how are you good i'm doing  excellent uh so super bowl is this weekend on sunday of course who do you want to win i have really  no root and interest in the game but i think the broncos are going to win out of the two teams who  has a prettier jersey the broncos orange jerseys better why is that it just looks nicer to me  now if they started having to wear like uh tighter pants how'd you feel about that  uh i think it's one of those jokes no it's fine the tight pants are all right now who has the uh 
[00:19:00]  the prettiest hair in the nfl i'm not sure about that all right all right thank you  everyone gets so nervous with the gay that's great they get very nervous he's doing this interview is  just going to make me gay by association right that guy was terrifying he was really really tall and  like big fucking right yeah and he kept like we kept seeing him as we were walking around the  boulevard and kind of looking because we he was the one guy that we weren't sure he was going to 
[00:19:30]  find us and punch us all in the face right making him look like he'll leave think about it a little  and go i should have kicked someone's ass over that but to be fair for a straight guy he was wearing  pretty tight sweatpants was he we'll see well that's a very good job sal all right that's a good  one sal ballsy yeah balls out there huh yes it is absolutely it's not easy to do i've done a lot  of man street interviews man it's like you start to think like wow this is funny but i do have a  jaw to be broken yeah i thought i i thought for sure that the biker dude this guy was gonna hit him 
[00:20:00]  especially because if you listen to the tape that we just played sal kind of kept going with it  uh-huh and i was like holy shit sal i'm like jumping in with that guy like you're on your own  buddy you wouldn't jump in with anybody if fucking if dakota fanning hit him you'd sit there and watch  it that's true yeah that guy looks at the kind of guy that would fucking just belt you fast  he has a history too oh if you look at that guy he looks like he's got a history he's had some 
[00:20:30]  issues in the past yeah yeah he's spent some time in lockup he's fucking hurt some people very badly  yeah yeah he's probably like totally straight but he has a thick beer can dick that he has sunk into  other men only said a lesson and also only because he was doing four years or something  that guy is a fucking animal you can see the patches on his jacket right now you can't really  make it out but you can definitely see that that word says hate right of course and this says fuck you  on top of my god oh my god and he blew the pipe right in your face yeah i didn't like that blew the 
[00:21:00]  pipe did he do it on purpose of course sound reciprocated now if you had been asking you  normal questions do you think he would have done that or he would have been nicer to you no he'd  have been a lot nicer yeah yeah he people got that sense like immediately that i was trying to do  something i suppose and then this guy just was yeah not having it you know well you're trying to make  them look like fools yeah right right tighter pants and instead this guy just said yeah you look a 
[00:21:30]  little gay you look a little gay yeah it sounds like i've had that conversation in the mirror  i love how they all tapped out yeah oh they got nervous all right thank you yeah that's it then  yeah goodbye all right whatever we don't know i was informed this would be a football interview  goodbye the weather's finally changing just in time for the super bowl it's gonna be what 40 today  yeah nice bob kelly got me so good last night and i know bob you're fucking me a piece of  i'm walking out of the cellar and i see bobby and he goes we're talking about going to ufc he goes 
[00:22:00]  yeah dude there's supposed to be a big storm they're thinking of moving the super bowl to  saturday i'm like really i hadn't heard that he goes yeah dana already said if they do that  they're doing ufc on sunday i'm like oh i'll check the weather and then as i'm in my car i'm like  that lion cocksucker he got me for like 10 minutes as i'm driving home i'm like that's ludicrous  i checked my fucking weather app but he did get me but how would they be able to change everything  like great question they wouldn't be the answer impossible you're right that's logistically  impossible yeah a big storm coming fuck got me good well yeah it's supposed to be like i guess in the 
[00:22:30]  uh 90s 30s yeah 30s during game time yeah it's fine that's easy yeah no problem they do playoff  games in that weather like it's nothing yeah the end of the season actually a lot of games are played  in that so it'll be fine but did you see the the governor of georgia with the snow and ice down  there well they giving him shit well yeah fuck yeah yeah taking full responsibility i love that one 
[00:23:00]  nothing happens this will never happen again i take full responsibility but they're saying he  fucked up yeah yeah he just didn't understand you know the severity of what could possibly happen  down there indeed are people uh back home finally they they get their cars back that they're getting  their cars back uh the roads are back open and i guess their schools have to be closed another day  but why i guess they still gotta clear some shit off the roads jesus some of the cars and amazing 
[00:23:30]  yeah it really did shut the fuck down and the governor i mean you know he's not gonna do anything  differently no what are the odds you can't waste money every year for snow removal in a place that  doesn't really get storms like that now you roll them bones you roll the dice right roll the  fucking dice and hope it doesn't happen for another few years period yeah and uh i guess this clip is  it good here's the goal right here oh we got okay what were you gonna say no i was gonna talk about 
[00:24:00]  the blase of that oh sure of course we will it's wolf blitzer it's got to be good yes yeah it's true  guys today forthrightly at your news conference earlier today some people are criticizing you though  saying what took so long for the apology yes i actually apologized uh the the first day  waddle doodle um and you know apologies are something that don't change the circumstances  apologies are very good what we intend to do is to change the circumstances so in the event 
[00:24:30]  such a similar event occurs in the future that we will react earlier and that we will have the  resources to be able to make an effective dent in that problem are you going to fire anyone  what i think is way too early to be talking about firing anybody i don't look for scapegoats as i said  earlier today i think it's important that we identify what the problems are we've already had a meeting with  our major uh agency heads and we've asked the question of them what would you do differently 
[00:25:00]  what do we need to do better and how do we go about making sure that we fill all of the holes for future endeavors  but we need someone to be fired so he can report on it and go to his house right talk to his wife and  yeah yeah yeah what a baby of question that was baby why did the apology take so long right really  that's where you've come from standing on the fucking roof in baghdad as well right right right  why didn't you say you were sorry sister sooner you didn't say it sooner who the fuck needs an apology 
[00:25:30]  anyway yeah yeah maybe in your personal life someone that's really close to you but  will someone be fired i don't give a fuck if a governor apologizes to me no fuck yourself means  nothing there's another clip where the governor someone from cnn was trying to ask him a question  after a press conference and he started getting mad at the cnn guy and basically saying that  they fucked up the weather forecast and that's one of the reasons why all this shit went down  i don't know if you can find that clip but he refused to talk to cnn because he was very mad at 
[00:26:00]  their forecast he was trying to blame the weather people blame the weather guy hey your forecast  sucks yeah if you can find it great if not whatever so we probably should break joe rogan's going to  be here any minute we got food in front of us so perfect time to break joe rogan joining the show  uh in a few minutes here ricky gervais later bruce buffer a little later and uh studded yeah absolutely  and i'll be doing impressions oh my new impressions really it's everyone i do everyone and i've never 
[00:26:30]  done on the show because i'm embarrassed by how good i am and then all of a sudden that's all people  are going to want to hear well you can do one now who would you like marcel marceau  need proof how you doing joe rogan how you doing man yeah we just came back from uh of course the  mics you know i don't have the board in front of me there you go there we go joe's walking in

[00:27:30]  and we have we had kareem abdul jabbar in here i think twice now right or at least once once in  here and now once he was i just came to meet him when he was in the lobby and i could totally relate  to some of the stuff adam carolla was saying because he's a weird fucking dude man  i think you fuck more than 10 000 women yeah that was like it's a big story right  wait that was will chamberlain i thought was it will didn't kareem was probably more religious  i'm guessing yeah i got blown a few times but yeah it's will chamberlain but imagine kareem 
[00:28:00]  instead of airplane to me it's all those black dudes they all get into some older tall black  dude category just fucking everything that moves but our story with kareem abdul jabbar you're  talking about one of the the greatest athletes of our time whether you like basketball or not he's  right the fuck up there and we watched him get yelled at by his publicist because he wasn't  promoting his dumb children's book on our show yeah he was talking about basketball go figure we  have we were having and and the publicist got all fucking pissed off and he looked at us like 
[00:28:30]  can you believe what i have to deal with and she's a real she's a real cunt actually i think she's not  even allowed in the building anymore yeah but kareem yeah kareem abdul jabbar has her as the as his  publicist well she had a bad reputation the first time i was here i came in to meet him and she was  uh they said that oh she's really difficult to deal with and but and like you know you can't  ask her for anything and i happened to see kareem walk out and he recognized me for my one episode  of bored to death that was the only reason he took the picture with me and then they shamed him into 
[00:29:00]  signing a ball right i was like could you have like a fucking five-year-old handing a ball to the big  man it's like a mean joe green commercial but the big but we felt so bad for the guy we had a really  good interview with him and you i mean you're doing this now too obviously and you're gonna you're gonna  promote eventually whatever the fuck they need to promote which we did properly that's the way to  do it though right now you haven't stuff it down right no one cares at that point you get it in  eventually but then yeah right after the interview she's just yelling and screaming and pointing out  i'm like that's fucking cream abdul jabbar you can't do that to him i suspect that's why he likes her 
[00:29:30]  though that was my opinion there's something about you without a doubt there's something  you're taking maybe some subservient diaper yeah yeah there's something about that that it just  struck me as a very odd couple yeah yeah they flew together i flew in with cream too oh you did and i  felt bad for him because he was like three seats behind me and then when you look at him like trying  to sleep he has to sit straight up and he put a blanket like over his head like fucking et in the  basket because he can't get comfortable there's no way he can put his chair back and get comfortable 
[00:30:00]  when you're seven when they walk through this door it looks like the fucking thing from close  encounters amazing when it comes out of the ship they're just lanky tall arthritic knees we've had  some just we've had some tall fuckers in this room yeah remember the guy from the harlem globetrotters  yeah his head was basically touching the ceiling isn't it freaky seeing those dudes when they're older  too because they're all their bodies all fall apart yeah well that's what i was can't fucking  handle it but that's what i was getting at the clip that i saw with adam corolla he basically talked to 
[00:30:30]  kareem abdul jabbar asking him why there's no 70 year old uh tall guys walking around jeez they're all  dead they're all dead yeah but adam had an uncomfortable moment because he brought it up with kareem and  kareem's like jeez man i never thought of that before thanks basic fluid dynamics you know and yeah pumps  in altitude it's a shorter guy right yeah that's the pressure you don't see old yeah you don't see  old fat guys and you don't see old uh tall guys plus it's a fighter pilot who wants that fucking 
[00:31:00]  some fucking big lanky zilch with his face pushed up against the top of the window you don't want a  six foot nine guy in that little shitty space top of the window whatever the fuck it's called he hits  the automatic eject and his fucking dumb ostrich head gets stuck in the window and he's decapitated  weird posture yeah yeah yeah when you're uh when you're flying in those jets like i flew in an fa  18 once oh man angels those guys uh they're all like these shorter stockier guys like they have 
[00:31:30]  to be under six feet tall they're all like real bulked up because the part of the uh the flying  thing is the forcing the blood into your brain by hooking you know yeah yeah yeah you're you know you  don't have want to have a lot of space to do that if you have a lot of space to do that it just doesn't  the blood doesn't wait that's how you don't pass out yeah it's like so insane yeah keeping the blood  in the upper part of your body and in your head i would forget to do that oh so would i i did forget  i made it and then i forgot at the end at the end i forgot and i blacked out for a second yeah but 
[00:32:00]  the uh the g-force we went seven and a half g's was the hardest we we went but i blacked out like  at less than seven and a half g's i forgot to hook wow we went to like i've never forgotten that  it's pretty intense it's pretty it's pretty crazy do you have to do that the whole time  no no no only when you get into like really heavy g-force oh and they tell you banking when you're  making a hard turn it's madness when you you realize like the amount of pressure on your body 
[00:32:30]  does they usually have g-suits but these guys uh the blue angels don't wear them right they just go  well that's amazing man that's like that we don't need that that's crazy they're all animals  the shit out of this yeah right just lifting weights put the weight down getting a fight  fighter jet getting a machine that's yeah yeah we'll just go like you know twice the speed of sound  americans but do they have to do that the whole time too or do you eventually get to a point where  you don't have to no you always have you do it i heard the guy in front of me doing it was really 
[00:33:00]  scary because he was flying and we you know when we're hitting seven and a half g's it's like an elevator  door like you feel your conscious tunnel vision you literally see it close in because the pressure  is insane and i hear him go i'm going oh he's black and we're not that high off the ground  you know you know a thousand feet off the ground or something like that i mean how long does it take  to get down there with a plane no time if he loses control i mean we were flying fast and hard and we 
[00:33:30]  were going through a mountain range was going all the features of death yeah yeah yeah the dude uh  they show you a lot of things before you do it like they show you like how to eject how to fall  right if you if you're parachuting it's pretty intense but damn and they just assume that hooking  thing's gonna work it works it works it works and that guy's gotta just make sure he does it's the same  principle in like in a lot of ways that you would use in jiu-jitsu to keep from getting choked 
[00:34:00]  unconscious but it wouldn't work in jiu-jitsu because the guy could just close it off right  right pinch it like an elephant like a like a like a garden hose you're using your yeah you're using  your muscles to keep the blood up in your head yeah like you're giving yourself a head rush yeah  just straining like when you're straining taking a dump like that's the best way they figured out  they must have a lot of people must have blacked out before they figured that out oh my god the one  guy out of seven that came back what'd you do i don't know i just kept going that's the way we do  it joe were you scared oh yeah okay it's scary it's it's crazy the speed of those things it's just 
[00:34:30]  there's speed and then there's like fighter jet speed when you're uh you know a couple hundred  feet above this mountain range we were going sideways and back and forth and banking this mountain range  he took me on a wild ride did you get sick i did at the end too yeah i was fine to the end man a  fucking pussy i turned into a man i blacked out of the end for a second and i threw up  i would do that as i was getting into the plane i bet people have yeah yeah oh yeah it's scary 
[00:35:00]  because you you first of all you take off straight up in the air like you you launch straight up and  the just that alone you have to hook when you're doing that because that alone hits like three g's  or maybe a little bit more yeah that's pretty amazing and then you're instantly like in space  it seems like you're going so fast why do passenger planes take so long to get up here well the other  thing is they're up there in no time it's small it's this cockpit is like tiny little thing you know 
[00:35:30]  and like you you feel so you know you're so the ground's right there yeah it's like it's there's no  space like a big plane there's there's the middle row and then the you know the far left or there's  none of that no it's like everything's right here and the window's there you're just in a little  tube did you uh you get a little high before no way no i don't freak you out i want to be right  there with that one yeah i don't want to be up flying around thinking about how do i know the color blue  that's enough of a high holy that's you do that on a passenger plane uh the captain is put on the 
[00:36:00]  hook light and the whole place you have to grab your uh your uh your thing too like your stick  the stick in front of you you're not just hooking you're holding on to something or you can grab  like the the the seat belt that's holding you in place right you want it like yeah you want to force  the whole body i would just stop doing that i know i would well if you did you don't like the door 
[00:36:30]  closes and then you all of a sudden come back you're like where is oh that's right i'm in a fighter  plane oh i'm flying oh i'm flying how long did you black out for me from it was only a second i  had to realize that i because i i blacked out on a turn oh wow did you have a gopro on you or something  no it was a long time ago it was 99 because i love those you see the person they just go  oh my god it's got like bell's palsy and he's fucking drunk yeah i think they ended up tiger 
[00:37:00]  woods like falling asleep and puking really yeah really like he was like they're like posing with  them and then he gets in and he's hot and then he throws up yeah she had to find that video yes and  that was an escalade as he hit a fucking oak tree going five miles an hour across his face right did he uh  what god the target was did he just puke on himself or they give you something to vomit into  they give you a bag oh yeah you have a little vomit bag i'm sure they're so used to clean and puke out  of the back of those fucking planes probably hate it it was like a it wasn't like a like open the 
[00:37:30]  floodgates stand by me stephen king vomit it wasn't one of those baby bird baby bird that's the best  why did i say stand by me that was fake we were there for the greatest puking of all time there's no  better for folks who haven't seen that there's the greatest moment in the history of anything i've  ever been involved in it's fantastic we've never come close to that day well you can't now that's  the the grossest thing about corporatizing something like the opian anthony show is that you can never  get away with this no no what was it like 2002 or something like that when we first got back six 
[00:38:00]  four or five no no that was in krock which was in 2007 no i know it was last week oh you're right  it's tomorrow morning just keep going whatever it was krock which was oh seven there was garbage pails  or garbage buckets and plastic all over the ground and just launching puke into someone's mouth  while there was how many people in the room like 15 20 guys laughing their dicks off it was one of the  funnest one of the finest moments of my life you never see you never see things like that no you 
[00:38:30]  can never get away with it you can see a diabetic is drinking 75 shots of eggnog yeah so no liability  there collecting his fingers and toes like an escape from alcatraz what a crazy fuck he is is he still  around yeah pat from monarchy and pat duffy's a fucking animal yeah that kid we just saw him last  week for the first time in a while yeah that was an amazing day yeah pat duffy leaned his head off of the 
[00:39:00]  the end of this garbage bucket and pat from monarchy threw up in his mouth this cartoon blast of puke  that you couldn't imagine coming out of a person's body yeah what an end if you didn't see it if you  didn't see you couldn't imagine the amount of volume it was a fire hose of puke yeah it really was  over and over you think ilm did it it was like that fucking like cool looking yeah i gotta find a  better video of that there's a video online there's a few videos online that are amazing it exists  but we had a bob has it actually even well we had a really good copy of it and then youtube took it 
[00:39:30]  off but they they allow the other versions up there for some reason it's the greatest they're not in  hd who named it the baby bird too i thought you invited joe no no it was definitely wasn't me  naming the baby bird it was my idea to get him to lean his head over the bucket and then had pat  throw up in his mouth feed him like i just never thought anybody would say yes to that i was just  being an asshole i was just i was in fear factor mode yeah yeah but so i think was burr i think bill  burr was there yeah oh my god eric is saying bill burr always burr okay he was there too yeah it was 
[00:40:00]  one of those days man oh it was glorious it was glorious i've watched that so many times so many people  girls like i was trying to i'm like you got it it's the greatest i was i stood corrected it was  not the greatest thing i ever saw i saw a disgusting video yesterday that someone sent they always do  say check this out and uh it it i had to turn it off because i was starting to get feel faint it was 
[00:40:30]  some happy interracial couple yeah it was sick i think it was down in brazil some guy had uh  had robbed some pregnant girl at gunpoint and and he ended up getting shot so he's laying in the street  with like it looked like a bullet wound to the heart and one to the side and he's laying there  kind of writhing around i guess they got the cameras on right away blood all over the place 
[00:41:00]  and he's trying to get up and he's coughing up blood at one point he starts coughing up more and  more to when there's just black blood flying out of his mouth he's choking on his own blood  he winds up dying right there was he slipping in his own i almost think i saw that video if  he's like laying on in front of a store or a bodega or whatever yeah a bunch of people around him  just yeah taping and and they're going like every time he coughs up blood you hear the crowd go like  whoa and it's like this is the sickest thing i've ever seen and i started i'm watching i wasn't 
[00:41:30]  thinking about or anything and i'm like i could puke if i watched this any longer was he a criminal  is that disturbing yeah and that's how everybody rationalizes watching it it's like ah fuck him  good he deserved it it's like wow that's brutal he's and you could tell he knows what's going on  and he's trying to get up and giant amounts of blood are pumping out of his mouth no help from the  crowd those scary ones they just crowd it and they're they're cheering like whoa every time 
[00:42:00]  like fireworks are going off that it was bad i don't watch that live leak it was all i watch those  videos joke i don't anymore i've seen enough yeah yeah i don't i've seen enough yeah i've seen enough  i've seen enough i've seen enough decapitations and i can't watch those at all the last one i watched  was a guy doing it to uh supposedly it was his girlfriend who had done something there was a cartel  one and he did it with a small knife holy shit like oh god why am i watching why yeah you gotta  go like why am i why am i doing this to myself i guess you watch it because you want to know what 
[00:42:30]  people are capable of ah because most people like you run into would never consider doing that but  you need to know there's people out there they're not playing by the rules don't you know though that  it happens by the end result you don't have to see the whole yeah but formula there you know i didn't  necessarily know what i was watching yeah yeah you know it's just like this is up this guy does some  really fucked up shit to this woman okay click yeah sometimes you fall in like that one last  night i was watching because it sounded like and all the guy puts is check this out it's  fucked up it's like all right now i gotta kind of check it out you could check it out for a few 
[00:43:00]  seconds realize well that's what i did the second the amazing amounts of blood started coming out of  his mouth i'm like all right i gotta punch out of this i can't i'm a pussy i just don't go there it's  because you can't unwatch that shit yes like that is with you now forever and ever i got caught  watching a video where in the middle east they uh set a dog on fire like one of those the cutest  dog you could imagine and it was kids and they set the dog on fire and the things running around on  fire and they're just laughing they think it's the funniest thing ever it made me sick to my stomach 
[00:43:30]  and i decided that right there i ain't watching these type of videos anymore  that i found they made me more in really an odd way empathetic towards these things like you hear  about decapitations or beatings or deaths right and then when you see it happening you're like it's not  just these bunch of words put together like there's a real process to it and it's agonizing but when  you realize it's sickening it's sickening to realize when you realize what humans are capable yeah i don't  like to know that they could go that far but in the middle east they don't they don't respect dogs 
[00:44:00]  like we do so to them it's i don't know i guess it's like if we did it to a squirrel or something i don't  know yeah but you would feel gross we did that to any of course right yeah yeah yeah of course you  fucked yeah laughing torture that's up then you gotta like go to lol cats and go oh look it's  swatting something it's all cute it's uh i saw one in the middle east where there was like i guess  they were religious crimes there was three guys uh kneeling there and they just covered them with  like gas and they just kicked these three tied up guys into a hole that they dug and just threw a 
[00:44:30]  match in three guys piled on top imagine burning to death with two guys piled on you how unpleasant that  that would be unpleasant yes for a religious crime oh my goodness they just there are there  there's some going on that like what i don't think was supposed to get out of their little area  right and then with the internet and everything it's like now hey any there you go any 10 year old  can just watch this which i think is so much worse than porn and it's more like here's something 
[00:45:00]  i did seven years ago i could finally show the world yeah you know it might have been a tape in a  box somewhere and and years ago like like with with porn years ago it was just all right i got a  magazine i could spank one out or something like that there wasn't like oh can you get me a magazine  of people chopping people's heads off like that never existed this watching people get murdered just  didn't exist until the internet yeah that was so that was the first time so much of that no dr francis  be gross was a real doctor i was so heartbroken when i realized as an adult the camera angles were 
[00:45:30]  all wrong yeah oh yeah there's no way they'd be under the monkey with the camera that monkey brains  thing was the monkey brains thing fake well doesn't that drive you crazy about some reality shows  like you know what drives you i was watching moonshiners and they got a camera in  the car they get pulled over by the cop the cop is looking at the camera and doesn't want say hey  what's the camera hey what are you guys doing what was this a tv show hey do i have to sign a release  he's looking right out of the camera through the door yeah nothing not a word assisted reality 
[00:46:00]  yeah it's not in the reality shows anymore it's too bad and then you like the camera guy stays with  the cop right and then you see the car drive off from the cop's perspective right what am i watching  standing there with the cop yeah yeah it's it really is you guys have multiple cameras here  this cop's not even talking about it yeah well we're watching this one show that uh sam turned us on to  90 day fiancee is it called yeah 90 day fiancee it's pretty good the best show on tv it's like 
[00:46:30]  90 day fiancee it's these mail order prize these guys they're k1 visas so basically broad comes to  america and now she could stay for 90 days but if you marry her she stays for good so she just  you like a wild animal for 90 days oh you but you think that would be that would be good they got four  couples they're following that are on these 90 day visas these guys are all saps they're all  fucking like you know ah she's a great girl and i think and these girls are like well we need to get  married and you know she's gone the second the one sat from cleveland refinanced his whole house to 
[00:47:00]  bring her to america he's gonna lose everything it's so obvious they're all there's a there's an  obvious gay guy but i guess they're not going to say he's gay or maybe he's denying it or something  hottest girl hot she's like a sex doll oh she's a colombian sex doll basically all she wants to do  is have sex all the time and steal your kidneys yes yes leave you in the tub with a note go to the  hospital hey i knew someone that happened to of course everyone does and he's avoiding sex and 
[00:47:30]  and he's avoiding it because he wants to be pure and he's trying to save money he's got this amazing  girl from colombia that he moves into his uh parents house with him the show rules joe i think  it's pretty funny and then the the last one there's one couple they don't even like focus on because  it's relatively normal but then there's a brazilian broad that literally could be a supermodel she's  gorgeous and she doesn't know how gorgeous she's she is because she's from a small town wow and she's in 
[00:48:00]  la and they make that she went to this hair salon and the people there are just gushing over her and  like oh let's put some makeup on you you're beautiful she's like and they were telling me i was  beautiful and she didn't even know and this guy is like this dumpy guy with some male pattern  baldness and he's like uh don't talk to them he's so nervous he's trying to hold over he knows it's  a matter of time she could literally would be with any nfl superstar tomorrow and she's with this guy  who's just trying to shield her from everything and she will be with them she'll come home and be like 
[00:48:30]  like why does your pussy smell like cocoa butter that's a long story it's so bad because like  it's we were talking about that yesterday how we've all been in a situation where we've you know  gotten a girl that was out of our league and you just try to keep her away from it it just doesn't  work it just doesn't i think this show is gonna be terrific so far so good yeah that's pretty funny  man i want to ask joe about anderson silva we all saw the fucking leg break oh yeah how did you  keep your composure when you were still announcing that i've seen too much i've seen too many people 
[00:49:00]  get the beat out of them i was trying to think about this the other day because uh my wife cut  her head you know she had um you know that there's a hatchback to her car right and uh she picked up  something and didn't realize that the corner was like right there and bonked her head it wasn't it was  a tiny cut but it was trickling down her face it didn't bother me at all like seeing blood like running  down her face she's so used to blood walking off i was like yeah it was nothing it's a little  size like not even a half an inch or cut i was like explaining like you know it's like one stitch 
[00:49:30]  like to me it's like that's nothing right you've seen too much and i thought about it like how many  people have seen as many people get the beat out of them as me like i've seen at least a thousand  people get the beat out of them like feet from me several feet from me by the greatest martial  artists in the history of the world right i've seen them all like a few feet away i'm so used to  physical violence like one-on-one violence completely used to it i've seen fights break 
[00:50:00]  out in nightclubs where when i was younger i would kind of get freaked out a little bit but my heart  doesn't even skip a beat wow it's really weird yeah yeah you're like the guy uh but that lens in the  nom was saying too much didn't i understand that it was a girl who's had like a thousand cops  exactly you're not gonna impress her not at all but you should go down on her  it's like i knew that it was a bad injury and i knew his leg was broken but you know  there's a weird uh detachment to injury that you get when you've seen so many of them wow i've seen 
[00:50:30]  two of those where guys snap their legs from getting a kick checked both of them it's the same thing a  guy lifts his leg up you catch it right below the knee the shin is very hard like the the  the the the part of your bone right above the knee when it it comes in contact with the lower part of  the leg boy that there's a losing proposition lower part of the leg lower part of the leg just does not  hang in there just snaps off snaps that there's a lot of videos of that online so it's almost always 
[00:51:00]  the exact same break the lower mid part of the leg upper part of the shin they check the kick crack  it just wank and just rubbers just like a like a rubber foot what happens to the uh the other  bone behind the uh the tibia and the fibula both yeah yeah both of them both break yeah because it  gets all rubbery like that it's gone they're both gone they're both most likely with anderson um the  the thought is that he broke one of them either the tibia or the fibula cracked them with the first 
[00:51:30]  check kick because apparently it really hurt bad oh right they all hurt but you just walk it off you  pretend you don't think about it you just deal with the pain but when a guy checks a kick it's  really painful it's painful for both of you it's painful for the guy checking the kick and painful  for the guy who throws the kick so a lot of times you don't realize how much pain you're in you just  keep like a lot of times you break your hand you don't even know your hand's broken because it's  like it's in pain like i don't know what's going on there let's just keep moving right and see if  this feels better in a few minutes or you know and you sit back in your corner like look my hand's numb 
[00:52:00]  this thing's broken happens like all the time wow so you think he had a broken tibia at first  one of them and then and then he's he's just on it oh and then he threw it again same kick crack and  it just snapped like a twig yeah i was listening to you closely i'm like man joe's not even faced  it's weird you get so so used to it right you get so used to injuries and concussions and chaos and  cuts and blood so it's very strange it was odd though to see like because we were me and kenny were 
[00:52:30]  he was brought right by us and to see a guy who's that great of a fighter and that built for that life  yeah all of a sudden stripped of all of that like in it when you're that injured and you're just  yelling like you're just hurt and there was no amount of training that could make you not hurt  in that moment that was what was really upsetting to see was a guy reacting in that moment like i would  react just screaming because he was where is he at this point what uh well he's um he's not walking  around without crutches yet but it's probably pretty close i mean they can do amazing things with medicine 
[00:53:00]  right they have a titanium rod that's inside of his bone that's going to be there for life  it's there forever sometimes people have real like sometimes they put plates in their arms and things  you know in the outside and then people go in and they have another operation to get them removed  because the plate causes them pain especially in cold weather things along those lines because it's  not organic some thing yeah yeah it's cold in your body wolverine yeah it's very weird i think dana  said very recently that he's going to fight by the end of the year maybe you know dana's a promoter 
[00:53:30]  he wants him to fight by the end of the year and anderson wants to fight too but there's there's  a real there's a real danger of that thing breaking again you got to make sure that it's completely  healed up before you check it again you know someone throws it's someone they're going to do the  exact same thing if you anybody who fights anderson's going to practice checking kicks like a  motherfucker they're just going to be you know how frightening how does he how does he continue to  kick for the first time you got to be like oh yeah you got to try it out for the first time guys have 
[00:54:00]  come back in other sports but those other sports are very different right they're they don't involve  purposely trying to break your bones right it was kind of a fluke that it got hit in that place in the  first place but yeah with that you're yeah you're hitting it on the wound now weidman's purpose yeah  weidman's had two weird fights with silva yeah what do you think of weidman as a fighter he's a  fucking savage he is yeah he's a real savage i i i knew that guy was something special a long time  ago okay there's something about you you watch dudes that can do things to guys it doesn't make sense 
[00:54:30]  like there's people and i've met them and i've trained with guys where they look like everybody  else they look the same but when you roll with them you're like what the fuck is going on here they  have like this freak chimpanzee strength or or they're just they can they don't get tired this  weird guy like kane velasquez is famous for that fucking guy doesn't get tired really he's got this  weird natural cardio on top of this insane work ethic he's also a biological freak like his vo2 max is 
[00:55:00]  through the fucking roof what does that mean his vo2 max is his ability to process oxygen it's it's insane  it's like elite endurance athlete level and he's 240 pounds with a giant fire hydrant head you know  he's a terrifying guy in that fact that he's not going to get tired he's going to beat the  fucking piss out of you and he's going to put a pace on you that you're not going to be able to  keep up with did you mention also i came recently in a fight about gonzaga and you said that's what  differentiates this guy from championship level is the fact that a guy like uh king just does not get 
[00:55:30]  tired yeah gonzaga is an awesome fighter he's a big giant guy but he gets tired real quick and one of the  reasons being is gonzaga doesn't train with elite guys he trains in ludlow massachusetts with his team and  you know i'm sure he's got a very a great school he's a great jiu-jitsu teacher he's got a really  like tight-knit group of people that really love him and support him but you got to get the  pounded out of you on a daily basis in order to compete at the elite level and like kane velasquez  has daniel cormier and he has you know todd duffy was there for a while and there's a bunch 
[00:56:00]  of guys at aka that are like elite heavyweights so he's like getting like really like strenuous  hard high level sparring on a regular basis if you don't get that if you're always the  best guy in the room it's actually bad for you wow it's bad for your your fighting style  everybody wants to be the guy who kicks everybody's ass but in order to be the guy who kicks everybody's  ass you got to get your ass kicked it's it's a there's no shortcuts to fighting that's fucking  like because that's something you don't want to have happen yeah you don't want to get hit very hard 
[00:56:30]  about the face one of the drills they do is they take five guys five fresh guys and you go in there  and you'll spar five minutes with one guy and then you're exhausted that guy goes out boom new fresh  guy goes in while you're exhausted and they'll just keep rotating guys and it's to get you comfortable  with being exhausted because a lot of what being exhausted is about is is mental fatigue and panic  you know people panic because the guy's kicking your ass you got to get used to being in there relaxing  you know when you're exhausted so you don't hyperventilate you don't seize up that's just 
[00:57:00]  another that's a different brain set i can't imagine but like i was saying there's guys like weidman you  watch them throw guys around you watch them beat the shit out of you guys like that guy's different  there's a guy that's different there's there's one there's there's every now and then you see a freak  and you go okay there we go we got one right here you know whether it's a grappling freak or it's a  striking freak you know there's guys that are just different they're built different they move different  they're stronger in their mind and a lot of them it's interesting come from a background where they  were getting their ass kicked by their brother all the time oh really yeah a lot of them a lot of like 
[00:57:30]  weidman that's his story his brothers beat the fuck out of him growing up and dropped a fucking metal  plate on his head like a olympic weight on his head when he was a kid like a lot of that kind of  shit and you grow up just a different kind of tolerance to pain and a different like ability to absorb  bullshit wait does he have a relationship with his brother they're both the same age they're older i think  he has older brothers do they fight those guys no i don't think so no i don't think so i don't know  though i imagine the dynamics have changed over the years a little bit a little bit a little bit a 
[00:58:00]  lot of a lot of them uh grow up like uh matt hughes is uh famous for having a twin brother who's also  an mma fighter and you know throughout all high school they just beat the out of each other yeah  they're so used to like fighting another savage in the house on a regular basis that regular fights with  other people like no big deal like here we go you have to get you have to have that i guess  that that you you were kind of raised in that because it would be odd to just like all of a 
[00:58:30]  sudden yeah i want to be a fighter and and you're not used to getting hit yeah you know hitting you're  just not used to getting hit you're that would be a little much well sort of like what we're talking  about about like watching disgusting evil videos and like god what people are capable of people are  really flexible like in a lot of ways like they're flexible mentally they're flexible physically  there's a like a lot of there's a range of how people can develop and behave yeah you see that  with comedians you see that with musicians you see that with fighters you see that with almost 
[00:59:00]  everything like how did this happen how do you get a guy like that how do i get a tom segura  you gotta have a lot of shit goes wrong to get a guy like this  you're in l.a tom yeah oh cool yep what is tom's story it's hilarious he's awesome it's one of my  moves a lot that's my story yeah yeah that's my that's my equivalent of a lot of big brothers  beating the out of me moving along in schools every few years father in the military uh finance  why'd you wait he moved around a lot in finance no just like you know uh it was uh promotions within 
[00:59:30]  oh yeah oh yeah see mine was different it was like demotions that my father was getting fired  and having to move because you know he's got to bamboozle the next place that we're renting and  lead them to believe he's going to pay the rent do you remember the houses getting shittier and  shittier or uh no they were all pretty much the same type of deal but it was like every couple  sometimes it was like every year but every year year and a half two years pack it up 
[01:00:00]  isn't it interesting how that adversity makes a different type of person i mean it just makes  a type of person that grows up with like really loving supporting family with great neighborhoods  and really good friends like almost never is funny yeah i don't know why you never have to  fucking like camouflage yourself or yeah what was the article that came out about you comedians i didn't  read about being psychologically damaged but i mean i could i could have told you that was like  in 1990 after my first set yeah but they share traits yeah share like a lot of traits with uh 
[01:00:30]  psychotic yeah you know what the problem with that article is though it was in the uk and they said  they they they they picked 500 comedians you tell me there's 500 funny guys in the uk  i don't buy a lot of those uk stories i think those stats uh apply probably a lot to open micers  though oh yeah like open mic you're like you're insane yeah yeah i think they can do it but like  you know if you're around like headliners you're not like you would have to be as crazy you'd have to 
[01:01:00]  test all the comedians to get 500 right because like we were trying to figure out how many comics  there are like like i was talking about this uh like after uh we were in vegas the other day i was  like it's so fun to like meet up with uh friends and that are comics like in another place and get to  hang out together there's like this extra sense of giddiness like because you know we understand each  other in a weird way we have a weird camaraderie and i was explaining like there's not many of us there's 
[01:01:30]  like a thousand professional comedians if there's 300 million americans a thousand are professional  comedians out of that thousand 250 of them are funny maybe maybe maybe and that's one of them  you know and i'm like i ran into one of them okay we're in vegas and you speak your own you speak  your own language yeah the language of the first thing i said to joe and i saw him is where do you get  your ideas don't you don't want to come to my job because there's a lot watch out watch what you're 
[01:02:00]  telling them they'll put in his act run out of things to talk about yes how do you prepare i've  watched i i don't go to comedy shows and i hadn't seen joe on stage in a long time because we just  again we both are working our gigs and i went with uh with kenny and annie letterman and uh my buddy rob  column and damn joe is a really funny actor i mean i knew that but i just hadn't seen him in five  years i haven't seen you in a while i love rogan i have been thinking about there's a couple of jokes 
[01:02:30]  he did that i have obsessed over i'm not going to say what they are but one is about uh get  a woman who doesn't want to you and one's about a guy jerking off in your face  they were just like ah i wish i thought of that really funny man really funny me and kenny talked  about you the entire rest of the week you just blew up my spot because i was about to say how  smart joe is on the stage but it was smart those two jokes it's in context yeah yeah yeah context of  the material but it was honest it was dirty but it was smart and it was really it was honest stuff 
[01:03:00]  and it's like to be able to it was something that you say that like i hate to go like i thought of  that but i never said like but as a person that's what makes a comedian good absolutely they focus things  and say things that you kind of you want everybody to go oh why didn't i think of that right  fucking funny and it seems so obvious when he says it well i always attribute you to i shortened my  sets after i watched you because i used to do like an hour and a half and i would do a q a sometimes and  my sets would go like two and a half hours sometimes they're so long so stupid i went through a period 
[01:03:30]  where i was doing that for a long time and then i saw you in austin and you did like 50 minutes and  i laughed my fucking dick off for 50 minutes i remember two things one like i like that better like  a shorter more concise quick you know it's like it's the right amount of time like i was wearing  people out it's too and then the other thing was i used to think that i had too many dick jokes and i  i was like i think i have too many dick jokes and then i saw norton i'm dying laughing for an hour it's  all dick jokes and i was like ah it's gonna be okay i think we're all right yeah i never worry about that 
[01:04:00]  is it too dirty is it not you know what i mean as long as you come from an original place that's all that  matters well it was fun it was what it was it's it's sometimes you need to that perspective of  being outside being an audience member right and getting to see somebody else to like we all  influence each other in a way but that's one of the best ways we influence each other you're like  you go oh okay i can i see like how this is fun this is enjoyable as an audience member you know  because you can get caught up in just only being a comic and only looking at your own act and kind of 
[01:04:30]  forgetting what it's like to be an audience right yeah yeah i don't like being an audience member  i mean no no you don't uh you rarely see anybody else never i love comedy man i'd love that's why  i always bring guys like tom on the road with me i bring really funny guys with me always yeah i  enjoy comedy i would way rather have a guy going in front of me and crush than a guy going in front  of me and bomb really yeah like i was at i was at a club the other night and there was a bunch of  comedians on in front of me and they were so bad i had to listen to music i was watching the comedy 
[01:05:00]  and i was listening to gary clark jr in my headset uh just that i was doing yeah it was just like i  had to tune out the the comedy was so dumb and because when you when you're listening to a comic  you're listening to that guy's thoughts like you're allowing them to think for you you're like going on  a ride through their thoughts and the thinking was so terrible it's like why are you turning there  like what are you doing you're backing up oh you're a fucking idiot you left all this behind like  every premise was like this fucking stumbling stupid stub your toe bump your fucking head it 
[01:05:30]  was awful it was just impossible to watch man oh terrible yeah you're sitting there just like  uh i'm in for a night of this shit just awful i used to do that with radio i used to love listening  to other radio shows and then it just got bad all of a sudden because of the corporations i guess oh  yeah that's just watered out everything and i remember that i just stopped listening  it was my hobby i couldn't wait to listen to another radio show to see what was going on 
[01:06:00]  this industry i think has been crushed more by censorship than any other yeah but the podcast  is bringing it back yeah but the podcast is definitely bringing back long-form conversations  uncensored long-form conversations because you will not find any of this  shit on regular radio and there's some great podcasts out there yeah it's just because they didn't  fuck with it that's really so simple like the the ideas are always there and you know what i really  love about podcasts there's so many people i've never even heard of that have really good podcasts  like someone will tell me hey go check out these guys and you know i'll go and they never would  have gotten pretty goddamn good just a bunch of guys sitting around with a they're funny guys there's 
[01:06:30]  a microphone and a zoom recorder right and then they upload it to itunes boom that's it look how  look how popular podcasting is and these incredible dopey radio companies can't figure it out still  well they're trying to stay well they know they step on their own dicks all the time lawyers you know  the fucking lawyers and the conversations we've had with these guys over the years  mind-boggling everything's a liability you know yeah you see everything everything good yeah yeah  it's always everything good yeah like baby bird how you like in podcasting you're still loving it 
[01:07:00]  yeah it's awesome it's it's like this it's i mean i learned how to podcast from doing your show for  sure i attribute this show to the reason why i i enjoy podcasting because your shows is to hang right  every other show is so controlled and there's fucking music and like let's go to break and we have this gag  coming up and this and that five minutes to the hour and we always do that but you guys it's always  like you go into a bunch of funny guys hanging around hanging out yeah that's always that's the  secret but it's a scary place to be to turn on not anymore for us i guess but you have to step out 
[01:07:30]  there and go wow we're really not prepared to do anything but it doesn't matter you have pages of  shit that's going on in the news right there's always talk about something yeah we have three  people if like if two if we any one of any two of us uh set microphones down and start talking there's  so much going on in the world on a regular basis you're never going to run out as long as you're  paying attention you're never going to run out of things to talk about well i want to start a podcast  called just joshing where a bunch of guys just kind of with the a little apostrophe after the 
[01:08:00]  end where everybody just kind of riffs we pick a topic of the day out of a hat and you have to  riff for 45 minutes alone 45 minutes alone no profanity that seems to defeat the purpose of having  other people well you know i don't know everyone just kind of laughs and supports you oh okay yeah  just i like that have you ever talked to deepak chopra no only on twitter okay because i'm i'm listening  to the your latest podcast i'm only about 20 minutes in and uh with carisana maria wow she's  fucking brilliant yeah she's very smart she's very smart and pretty she's brutal this girl is 
[01:08:30]  smart what is she doing she's a scientist okay she uh she's a neuroscientist and she was the uh  science editor for the huffington post and now she's on a television show i forget the name of the show  but she's uh she's going to do a podcast soon um that's one of the things we were talking about  when she was on the show yeah we're talking about she can hold her own big time she can just go  forever she just you know some people just and again it's like there's so many things to talk about  this she has so many interests there's so many fascinating subjects and she's brilliant so she 
[01:09:00]  can just talk yeah oh she's uh not ditzy science she's like hell yeah she calls deepak chopra a woo  peddler yeah that's my favorite my favorite expression woo peddler is that great what does  you say he's peddling woo woo you know like woo bullshit he's peddling bullshit i think he knows he's  peddling bullshit at this point yeah we had fun with him on the show with his son i thought that  was fascinating i listened to that yeah see the marvid gay uh like relationship with the father 
[01:09:30]  there's definitely some brooding resentment yeah the son's not buying into the father's  bullshit well the son's right though i mean he has evidence he caught his father sleeping when  he said he was meditating i'm going to go to the temple and meditate  he's lying there with his gucci sunglasses on sleeping up the storm designer sunglasses  i would like to see him i would like to be a fly on the wall while he's trying to pull a  pussy i bet it's fascinating right yeah the consciousness that i invent up and develop there's 
[01:10:00]  a there's an um an application or something maybe it's a website that generates deep rock chopra quotes  based on words that he likes to use oh really just complete bullshit quotes that you would totally  see him saying like the elevation of the consciousness is a universal singularity you  know that's not saying anything saying nonsense yeah but you gotta give him credit for allowing that  documentary to be made where his son is basically calling him out the whole time yes yeah yeah yeah  definitely he's got a sense of humor by himself he does well he loves being you know famous yeah he loves 
[01:10:30]  well i don't think he's totally full of shit i think he's just i think that those type of thoughts  often lead to just full of shit statements and full of shit conversations i think he's probably you know  a guy who's genuinely seeking like enlightenment but it's it's unattainable for almost everyone  especially with no drugs and i think if you're not gonna you try to do it on the natch good luck if you  put out if you put out um your your opinions of things or your feelings and and they're based on 
[01:11:00]  your very deep thinking it doesn't mean it's true or right right or good or anything and i think  that's what he's doing it's like oh i've like why is he so enlightened yeah i think it's just him and  what he's thinking the subject matter is so slippery too yeah it's like this is such a gray area there  you can make anything out of it it makes people feel smart sometimes if you make other people feel  smart when they like you then they're like well i like this guy because agreeing with him makes me  feel like i'm a smart enlightened person he's a great salesman but i don't think he's totally 
[01:11:30]  full of shit either i just think he's a really no no i just have zero desire for what he is offering  i see more horse shit than uh yeah there's just too much horse  there's too much quantum too much quantum there's too much word salad like one of the most important  things to me about you relaying whether it's you relaying your childhood or you relaying anything  you're really i you need to be able to say it in terms that i can relate to and understand no matter  who i am or who you are and he doesn't do that no he's almost like he's purposely trying to confuse you 
[01:12:00]  with all these extra words right like weird words that are not necessary and did you guys go at it on  twitter no no no it's just a joke i just he said something like uh i think his quote was uh i used  to be an atheist hashtag atheist and before i realized i was god hashtag god and and i said son  don't make me smack you and then uh and then i wrote hashtag woo pedal much and then i and i tagged cara 
[01:12:30]  santa maria because that's her uh her thing i can't wait to listen to the rest of that thing i just  started at the gym yesterday she married no no no she's to date bill maher though really uh oh  i hear he has a big cock i bet it's huge i've heard that bill does  fucking rope really what cocky polish guy he has a giant dick good for bill  what i loved about her story so far she uh gave up on religion at 14. she was raised mormon  religious family and her father just prove that i listen to your podcast i guess but the father 
[01:13:00]  basically said but you know until you're 18 you know you got to do this if you want to live in my  house and she's like well i guess i'm not living here anymore yeah i couldn't imagine at 14 that's  crazy to just really know where you want to be yeah she's very brave that's uh that's hardcore  with your dad's that much of a dummy you're like all right i gotta figure this out because there that  could go either way well i remember being seven i was in first grade at uh um in this catholic school in  new jersey and uh this fucking nun i'll never forget this bitch sister mary josephine was such 
[01:13:30]  a hot name such an unbelievable if you saw her though she was built like a bag of jello i don't  doubt it was fucking pointy bones sticking out in various areas and she's just such an evil  cunt that i remember thinking okay well this is all bullshit i remember thinking this at seven  just because she was a fucking piece of shit well i was really religious for a while when i was a little  boy because my parents had split up and i was super scared and insecure and i was always talking 
[01:14:00]  about god and i was always talking about like religion and until i went to catholic school and  then one one year in catholic school fucking cured me wow right away i was like this is all  bullshit you would think it would be the other way around yeah like my mom got tired of me talking  about i remember them like getting upset at me talking about god like god doesn't want that god wants  us to do this like i was just an insecure little kid trying to figure out why my parents weren't together  anymore right and then all of a sudden i'm in catholic school and i was like oh well this is  bullshit this is these people are not connected to god like whatever god is it has nothing to do 
[01:14:30]  with these assholes it's just you realize you know like what you think god is going to be like god's  going to save me from all this you know evil human behavior and this he's bad thinking and bad you  know and then all of a sudden you're in front of this person who's supposed to be a representative of  god and you see nothing but just the worst aspects of humanity just bullying and nastiness and threats  and hitting kids and just like oh basically one shitty cashier ruined mcdonald's for you forever 
[01:15:00]  and don't forget about the priests you're just talking about the nuns yeah i didn't have any  bad situations with priests i don't have any molestations or anything like that but obviously  could have happened you know it happens to so many people it's it's it's insane my in-laws all the  priests they know are in the papers yeah it's incredible they know they know priests that  were touching kids down there it's a real sickening thing when you see a priest anymore you don't think  like wow this guy you like the association father how are you doing father no you just think oh he must 
[01:15:30]  have oh yeah what a creep every time you see an old collar every time you see an old priest especially  like oh he had to know something how many times has he been batted around to different parishes  or he just knew yeah yeah he just knew before this this new pope the the last pope the evil one  looked like he's from star wars yeah yeah emperor yeah whatever his name is oh benedict i didn't  want to say his name but red shoes that guy is like he's responsible for crimes against humanity 
[01:16:00]  i mean that guy like found people who were molesters shielded them and then moved them actively did  himself you know what was his position when he did that he was in charge right or some cardinal for  that but he was the one that would like take you like they would the complaints would come into his  office and he was the one that would like well we'll move you to des moines jeez yeah and then  you'd start other kids he was responsible for a guy was raping he i think he raped over a hundred  deaf children right and this guy he took him and moved him to a new place and he raped a bunch of other 
[01:16:30]  kids i think that's the pope that's the top guy i think that's why he stepped down oh for sure  well that there was a lot of scandals involved there was also the bathhouse the gay bathhouse  that was in the same place that the the vatican owned the building where the gay bathhouse was in  yeah within the like the real estate holdings of the vatican it's like this gay bathhouse no  shit they're a bunch of old homos and there's nothing wrong with that it's like what's what's wrong  is all all the protecting of child molesters and all the child molesting that go it's all from 
[01:17:00]  suppression it's all it's all from you know from that and you know just suppressing your sexuality  like that we're saying you can't have sex at all it just it's gonna it's your bottleneckling  this natural desire and yeah something perverted i think the people that would go into something where  you you're forbidden from having sex there's a problem right there yeah like what people is that  attracting well you know what's that interesting it didn't used to be that way it used to be 
[01:17:30]  that uh people that were in the priesthood were allowed to have families and children but these  guys were slinging dicks so hard because they were they were the rock stars i mean they were the guys  who had a direct relationship to god especially in the days before they translated the bible into a  phonetic language like when the bible was in latin like before martin luther nobody knew how to read the  fucking bible martin luther in the 1500s was the first guy to take it and and make it so that they're  the average person could understand and read the bible for themselves before that you had to listen to 
[01:18:00]  what the priest told you god said yeah so they were like uber rock stars and they were just they were  rich they had armies i mean the the fucking the vatican had an army back then yeah you know like  when the mongols were attacking china and they were dominating the world one of the the big issues was that  the the roman catholic church didn't want to get involved they didn't want to send their army yeah  go after the the mongol army wow they were rich they were slinging dick they had armies i mean it was  a very different world than what it is now with these people that have celibacy and they they shifted 
[01:18:30]  the rules because these guys slang too much dick what what change were they weren't allowed to have  families anymore i don't know i think it was just about a power issue i think these guys on our show once  i can't remember i think it was a financial i bet it was a bunch of the priests just going this  guys we got to stop this yeah they were just you can imagine the amount of power i mean in the the day  when you know people were being killed on a regular basis for not agreeing with religion i mean if you 
[01:19:00]  if you went against the church back then like one of the things about martin luther was that he was so  connected it was one of the things that kept him alive in his disputes with the church because he was  taking his grievances and posting them on church doors for all right yeah like these are the problems with  the church these are things we need to fix and before before that anybody else who did that was  killed like you you were dead they would burn you they would drown you like you were done wow and this  is like that was what was normal so yeah you think of the amount of power a priest had back then they 
[01:19:30]  were like they were not just religious leaders there were also these enforcers that enforced the word of  god with like death how many women probably fucked them to save their own husbands or their own  brothers of course of course well they also would give away they had this weird thing they would give  you like free passes out of purgatory if you donated money and all this weird who could guarantee that  right yeah there's so many different fucking weird fucking loopholes that they had engineered into the  system so they could sling loads and they're still you know they're still there as far as the the 
[01:20:00]  the money thing goes you know oh yeah you go to church you got to give money and then you know  you're you're a better person and people think you're gonna and where does them where does all  that money go really goes keep that bath house open there yeah what about the new pope a lot of  people love the new pope seems great he's on the cover of uh rolling stone magazine he seems ideal  but my question you think he he obviously knew all this was going on too well i don't think you could not 
[01:20:30]  know right you know it's like uh how do you not know i mean it's it's all like if i know about it  how does he not know right of course he knows yeah he probably i guess what i'm saying is i wonder how  close he actually was to all that yeah and i wonder if he'll ever say anything about it i mean it's you  got to think that there's politicians who come along who really aren't corrupt who really do want to fix  the system that's what their their life's goal is they really do want to help just like there's cops who  really want to do right they they're not corrupt they really do want to protect people and enforce 
[01:21:00]  the law and make the streets safer and make an impact and you it's when you find one of those you  go oh wow you're real you're a real good guy and it also happens to be a cop this is a real good guy  who also happens to be the pope you know it's like i think that's pretty rare it's like you know the  system's so convoluted and distorted yeah yeah by the time you get to any position like by the time you  get to be the president you're so compromised by special interest groups and corporations and  blah blah blah blah blah and you know whoever the is you know held held whatever the over your head 
[01:21:30]  to get you to agree to whatever the you're agreeing to that by the time you're a shell of what your  ideals really were when you first started as far as cops go i don't think i've ever known one that was  in it for like this noble reason it's always hey it's a good job a good living i get a pension  like it's never like i'm gonna make a difference i've never i've known a lot of cops never met one  that did it for the yeah goodness i knew i knew a captain who enjoyed veal uh who was who was in 
[01:22:00]  the italian food here go ahead stand them up but i told you guinea bastards yeah the fact that he just  he tucks his fucking napkin in yeah he's a real gentleman well that had to sop up his throat blood it  certainly did we should take a break uh joe rogan is here what are we promoting joe nothing i'm just  here just hanging right can we hang with you gotta have a gig where yeah um yeah it's at the manhattan

[01:23:00]  interesting story his book is very very good i haven't finished yet my reading habits are just  dog shit i'm really i'm ashamed of my reading oh you read a lot you read a lot more than anyone else  in the room but he lives in manhattan and you have to keep up appearances did you read the mike tyson book  no i haven't holy it's amazing it could be the best autobiography i've ever yeah i'm sure my life it's  six hundred and something pages and and it never gets dull i'm sure every page is like this guy did  more cocaine than almost anyone alive well you did coke and then fought right i can't imagine i just 
[01:23:30]  didn't know how how deep he was into the drug abuse no idea he he pretty much hid that for the public  yes in general we all knew he was nuts and stuff but we didn't realize that he was pretty much doing  cocaine every day of his life yeah he was a total drug addict i had no idea the brutal honesty of this  book makes it makes me first of all definitely believe he did not rape desirate washington like all  this stuff that just i really love this guy you know that woman was she falsely accused someone of  rape a year before that i heard that yeah i'd heard that not a good sign yeah i don't believe 
[01:24:00]  he did either he would walk around with bricks of cocaine man if he got caught with that not just  an eight ball he walked around with dealer amounts oh that's incredible shit that's crazy and the best  part of the book is you fast forward how many years ago was he down to absolutely no money six  years ago i think it was about seven years six seven years ago he's with this girl i don't think  it's the one he's now married to and they were in a supermarket this kiki i believe it was kiki 
[01:24:30]  i believe so he's still with who's i guess uh pretty much changed his life around but they  were in a supermarket and they were counting items because they didn't have enough money to pay for  it this is mike tyson wow who used to like i think there's a legendary story he walked into a  dealership and bought five or six rolls royce seven was it seven it was one for each day of the week  it was when he got out of uh i think it's when he got out was that the time but he used to buy  them for his friends too bottom for his friend but he said he wanted to have one for every day of  the week and then fast forward he's in a supermarket embarrassed because he doesn't know if they have 
[01:25:00]  enough money to pay for the groceries wow mike fucking tyson well that's what happens when you spend all  your money yeah he went through 300 million yeah three how do you go through 300 million you let don  king have power of attorney that's really not a bright move i don't think that guy's honest  what was he charging uh tyson for the towel four grand a week or something like that four grand a  week just for towels in his house and i mean i've gone through i've fucking jizzed on a few like i can  almost understand a thousand a week knowing my habits but uh four grand a week is just out of 
[01:25:30]  control especially in the 90s if there's a book that uh you should are you a reader yeah in that way or  yeah yeah i read books i brought my uh little nook no i know you read books but i mean like  autobiographies and i don't normally read autobiographies i'm reading going clear right  now the book on scientology oh wow lawrence wright fascinating it's it's fascinating just the history  of scientology how it got started and what's involved in the you know the process the auditing process and  all the different things i just started it but it's very interesting see i want to read that because we 
[01:26:00]  interviewed uh miscovich david miscovich's uh i think it's his name uh his uh niece or his daughter the  one she wrote a book about scientology she's out now but uh there was something about the book it  was good but and they got into detail but not enough detail like there was something about it  was almost like she doesn't seem like she's really she's still out she's still a little scared maybe  that's what it is but it was almost like when morton wrote the book about tom about uh scientology 
[01:26:30]  and uh tom cruise's unauthorized autobiography and we interviewed him and his conclusion was that  cruise is not gay and that may be true i look at the show i mean you know i've had my doubts but his  conclusion in this unauthorized biography it was that cruise was not gay and i'm thinking to myself  that's probably why they didn't sue him because even if it truly was an unauthorized biography the  fact that he came to that conclusion right is is a good thing um even if cruz isn't gay and he's just  sick of people asking him it makes that look you know yeah i don't know with a smoke it's usually a book of 
[01:27:00]  matches yeah you know a lot of times there is sure and the guy's stuck in cock by candlelight yeah  i look at my own smoldering campfire i mean  you know i certainly understand yeah i don't know did you ever get an approach to go into scientology  yeah i i bought a dianetics book one night from late night tv because uh you know i was a psych major 
[01:27:30]  in college and you know because of all my years in martial arts i realized that like a big part of  success is the way you think it was a big part of his managing your mind managing your emotions  so i read a lot of self-help books and one night i was uh alone in in my apartment in la right after  i moved just before the internet and there was a late night commercial for dianetics the lava the  explosion trying to that was exactly who they were gunning for too sure because i remember that same  thing and i'm like maybe i should get that yeah so i got it i never read it but i did get it because 
[01:28:00]  i would buy buy i would buy a lot of books and read half of them and they would just like sit my like  if you go to my office there's a lot of books but half of them have never been cracked i'm just a  child so uh i i you know i looked at it a little bit and i you know i was like hmm this seems like very  childish like there's something about the way they were described but these motherfuckers never  stopped sending me shit invite wow you like come to this thing come to that thing get a free this 
[01:28:30]  get a free that it was relentless for like a decade they continued to send me shit just one book that  i order i got on that mailing list these motherfuckers clamped on and never let me go yeah fascinating  fascinating shit they need new people that's what they've kind of fallen from grace uh the internet  of late the internet did that information's always the thing that kind of yeah they can't just  fuck with people anymore because now people have a voice on youtube yeah and all that where you can 
[01:29:00]  fight back and it's like it's a lot different than when they could target you in 1986 yeah you had no  voice and they had all the lawyers and everything and they'd shut everybody down well that's the rumor  for the rumor of the richard gear gerbil story the richard gerbil story he was trying to leave  scientology and they were like oh for real how about this pow that's the greatest fucking before  the internet i i grew up in boston my friend grew up in l.a we're the same age we both heard about  it how did that happen back then that's incredible amazing mikey the pop rocks kid is a scientologist 
[01:29:30]  and there was a rumor that he was talking about leaving and they pop rocks and pepsi that mikey would  die exploded like that shit it was pre-internet you gotta realize you know that richard gear one  is the greatest it's the greatest rumor it's not ever fucking it's the best one ever the  motherfucker of all rumors better than ass it's better than the rod stewart sperm being pumped from  his fucking yeah i didn't even believe that one when i was 12. yeah yeah something's like how much sperm 
[01:30:00]  i was thinking of how much i came and how many guys would have to come i think it was a gallon or  something suck it off his band now that we know we've seen pat from wunaki drink how many  fucking gallons of eggnog like you could drink a lot of jizz it'd be fine you wouldn't even your  stomach pumped but yeah the way that but that richard gear one like people believed it it stuck yeah  wouldn't you love to it allows the mike tyson of rumors yeah but wouldn't you love to talk to richard  gear about that he would probably hate it has he ever addressed it hell no i mean it's you'd think 
[01:30:30]  it'd be like hell no do you remember richard this is my defining moment of richard gear when richard  gear went on stage at some charity event after 9 11 was telling everyone to instead of be angry  to focus with love and all right oh and they're like you shut up you  goofy sheltered hippie we want to blow something up yeah that was the wrong thing to say in america 
[01:31:00]  after september 11th i'll tell you i remember richard gear is an american gigolo uh when he  was fucking banging that girl i saw that giant birthmark on his back and it's all i think of  it is that giant brown birthmark just stop with that get rid of it no you can get rid of that  shit now it annoys me he's pumped out some real shit rom-coms i think anyone has put a gerbil in  there in their ass fuck yeah i know they have definitely 100 my friend steve is a ophthalmologist and did his  residency in miami in the 80s and uh he saw everything he said he saw a guy with a light 
[01:31:30]  bulb up his ass he said they they've had like almost everything you can imagine people have  stuffed up their asses yeah why not a ferret 100 people have had gerbils  you're declawing i mean how does it fucking duct tape you're a rookie i mean you know if you're a  rookie you're a rookie if you have a tender inside if it's not calloused exactly if you want training  wheels a working man's anus yeah duct tape is the training wheels of the fucking gerbil in the 
[01:32:00]  asshole training wheels yeah people get all fucking coked up or whatever man and you want to feel  something in your ass i don't know it's never been my day but there's anything sexually  things laying around you could do before a fucking jerk if there's anything you could  think of sexually you go to the trip you just got to keep going what happens you're jerking off and  you have a carrot in your asshole and nothing's happening and then you hear that little fella  on the wheel and you're like someone's going on a trip oh that's uh that's how it happens 
[01:32:30]  that's how it should happen i mean they've there's so many internet photos of x-rays of things with  you know oh yeah scissors like you know handle first anything you can think of what was the one  we had you could think of sexually that someone hasn't tried at some point somewhere in the world  what was the one that was sent to us when we're doing radio in boston was it a trophy it was a  trophy right a basketball trophy was it a basketball that's right slam dunking the prostate right it was  and the x-ray was classic that's right it was a basketball trophy yeah he put it in absolutely

[01:38:30]  sick that is pretty bad that's disgusting not good bruce you wrote a book huh yeah did you actually  write it yeah but i had uh most of these people don't write their own books anymore well i mean  when i say i wrote it it's it's we're traveling all around the place i don't have the time to sit down  and put pen to paper like that but i had an amazing husband and wife team that have written bestsellers and  basically they called me up and i i wrote it over 40 hours on the phone with them with my words and then 
[01:39:00]  they took my words put it on the manuscript and i was i was amazed you know so it's great i haven't finished it  but what i've read is my reading habits are humiliatingly bad but it's unbelievably good  uh you talk about uh i first of all i didn't know you're a fighter as well i should have  known about a professional fighter that's i grew up in the world of fighting my grandfather as you  read was champion and my dad had me since i was five throwing punches but um i just always enjoyed it  you know i was always good always good for an enjoyable row as a kid and you know been in martial  arts and like all of us had our little fun here and there but never professional level 
[01:39:30]  had a dream of doing one pro fight but i never fulfilled it oh really wait was it set up or  no no no i really i really i was training so hard at one point that i just wanted to  have one i don't care if the guy was ranked 8007 you know just wanted to have to say that i had one  fight yeah yeah he was laughing at that you should just announce yourself that'd be so great  me if i could announce myself at the final table of the world series of poker that would be the place i  want to announce that would be pretty nice poker player huh yeah yeah have you ever played in the 
[01:40:00]  world series yeah yeah yeah you did yeah how'd you do very well you did yeah one time i was uh 2010 i  was in the main event it was like uh 8 000 entries uh-huh day five we were down to 478 people i worked  30 000 chips up to a half million 530 thousand wow last time before the first break i peeled back pocket aces  on the button oh if you play poker you'll get this so fifth uh was it eight 16 000 blinds the guy put  out 60 000 chips what's that i raised him up to 130 he went in the tank for like three minutes he 
[01:40:30]  called flop comes eight ten eight he snap checks oh no i put out 150 000 to see where he was at he  went in the tank for like literally like three four minutes you know i don't know what the  fuck you dude i'm listening like it's a foreign language he thought he sat there thinking about  his hand pocket he was going to do so you're sitting there wondering what's going on the physics  long story cut short king on the turn he didn't have kings he didn't have ace king he shoved me all  in there's a million chips in the pot i'm in the top ten percent of players i would be in the top ten 
[01:41:00]  you have a set of eights on my way to eight million dollars in winnings he flopped quad eights on me  quad eights oh fuck that son of a bitch you ever have all the all the blood semen  snot and everything come out of your body i thought you were going to say wind up in my  underpants yes my dad taught me win like you're used to it lose like it doesn't bother you i'm  sorry oh no that'll bother you holy oh man the pocket aces will fuck you so many times what are  pocket aces it's ace ace right off the bat they deal you feel it out you look you go oh try not to do 
[01:41:30]  that don't go oh and you look at your cards and then you know depending on what happens when the flop  comes out you'd be like yeah great what was cool about that was that i won money and then i two  weeks later i won the grand slam at hustler i got first out of 1500 won a good amount of money  but it wasn't the same as winning the world series no that is the uh the one you want our buddy does  that uh what's his name he's gonna kill us he listens every day we did his little documentary 
[01:42:00]  what oh kevin pollack he's the actor i play with kevin pollack he's played in my cash  case oh he's a huge he did very well also and uh uh two years ago yeah yeah i think it was last  year two years you ever have a full boat though and you flip the eight all of a sudden it's not  like a pocket seven you're like oh no here she comes rosie the fuck that's exactly what i just  heard i have no idea what i'm saying or what you're saying actually i thought you had to put poker 
[01:42:30]  there for a split second i don't gamble she comes rosie yeah that's a that's a language you couldn't  fake right you do not understand yeah but it's not that i followed a little bit there's a couple  of pocket aces i assumed were good but they weren't yeah yeah no well they're good they start out good  yeah you know if you flop another race you know the secret pocket aces push everybody out of the  hand on the flop or by the term which is the fourth card on the table because if you're against more  than one person you will lose with pocket aces 66 of the time you gotta have to get out the math 
[01:43:00]  down to play this game yeah it's it's all about the uh percentages and the numbers it's so  fucking annoying though you're like you do have to push and you're thinking i got aces i want people  in this hand i want them to pay you get greedy you don't slow play them get people to out  and uh be happy play your aces right right yeah oh man all right he's a poker player do you also when  you're not doing well let me just curiosity if this all gamblers did you ever uh scream into a pillow  that uh a police officer handed you because you were afraid of being taken out of the uh all right 
[01:43:30]  look it was a big hand he has a guy with a hand him a pillow he's a lunatic screams into this black  jack i was playing no i've never i've never been to jail i've never been to jail jim screaming in  the pillow that the officer gave you that's not a euphemism he really thought i had to go  i was had i you know when you split split split boom boom great hands but tell me how much money  on the line it was i think there was probably thirty thousand dollars on the table and of course you  know and the dealer i'm like this is great because the deal is showing a fucking five hey six oh there 
[01:44:00]  it is boom 21. all i can tell you is the best money in the world is money one oh yeah it's the  most fun most fun money to spend of any money you can possibly have i just can't handle the pressure of  i i i get too stressed out i can't i just can't do it i mean i'm too addictive and i would  fucking lose yeah we're gonna invite you to every game when you're in la i won't you know  there's all that money i'll just be thinking of what i could be doing on eros.com with all this 
[01:44:30]  fucking cash you know what i mean that's that's the way i gamble you know caution to the wind condom  i find it so fascinating that casinos are actually allowed to not let you play if you're good yeah  yeah they're allowed to do that they're allowed to like say we're we're losing money to you so you  can't play anymore that happened to me you did really it happened to me when i was 26 years old  the riviera hotel where they film casino used to be one of the the hotels in vegas my dad was a 
[01:45:00]  what they call a boss gambler whatever and i was playing blackjack since i was we saw dice there  yes we did see dice there um since i was 18 i've been playing and and then i had one weekend where  i had an amazing win i won like not a lot by any standards but a lot of money by any standards  is i won 36 000 yeah nice and on the last day it was sunday and as i got up to leave the pit boss  came up to me and he said congratulations on your win but we can never let you play blackjack at the  riviera hotel again i've been coming here for eight years what my dad was going there for 20 because 
[01:45:30]  you won yeah so lo and behold uh they let me play the shoe which is where they put six or eight decks  in and i did well on that but the poetic justice of the situation is the guy that did that to me they  they found him in a suite in the hotel with cocaine and hookers and he lost his job right  he wound up dealing blackjack at what they call the landmark back then which i think is a stratosphere  now so that was like to me the best poetic justice could have happened to the guy don't  ban me from the hotel you motherfucker yeah it's kind of shitty that they can do that yeah that is  it's ridiculous because it's you should be allowed to it's that you're supposed to win and they 
[01:46:00]  don't build those hotels on uh winners why don't we take those chips in the back we'll get some  champagne well it's also weird you're not allowed to count cards like how crazy is that like you  can't like use a strategy yeah well we talk that's what they actually want you to count cards because  they know everyone's going to do it badly we'd learn that from what's it though if you're a  math genius if you're good at it they tell you to leave but it's so incredible that they can actually  ask you to leave what they call the innkeeper's law rule or something like that where you guys think  you're allowed to uh ask people to leave your establishment i think that's what they go by or i 
[01:46:30]  not know what i'm talking about is there anyone that's so good to serve anybody you want is there  anyone that's so good that consistently win in vegas like they could if they didn't have any  restrictions they could just make a living off of vegas there is there are a few individuals and  usually in blackjack world it's mathematical brains one was actually a professional poker player who was on  that team they made the movie about bring it down the house spacey yeah you gotta be a mathematical  genius and it just kind of tilts your odds in your favor a little more puts you right over that 50 
[01:47:00]  mark so you're you're winning a little more than the house but it's not this thing where  all of a sudden you're you know 10 minutes later you got this huge stack in front it's work  i mean it's hard work i made my living for six kind of grinded out blackjack to pay my bills really  companies and it worked oh well for me it worked at that time i just needed like you know four or  five grand to pay my bills back then i would stop in and and and do it but quite frankly i wouldn't  tell anybody to live like that poker you can control the outcome in your money financial situation 
[01:47:30]  much easier oh yeah yeah poker's considered a game of skill that's why it's legal in the state  of california but they don't allow blackjack as you see in vegas and those unless you're on indian  chance yeah yeah game of chance i noticed with blackjack over the years though uh you you gotta  plant your ass there for a long fucking time to make money you can't just think you're gonna sit  there and dump out you know big bets and walk away but it takes a while yeah but if you want to win  you gotta get the velcro off your ass yes and you gotta know when to get up you gotta know when 
[01:48:00]  to leave yeah when things start turning you could feel a fucking bad shoe a couple of bad shoes a  dealer paul mccartney couldn't  but there is you know you kind of use the force and you're like yeah this is not  that it's time to pull to leave what would you bet in blackjack to get to four or five grand though  um what kind of i would always start off with two hands at uh 50 a hand 50 yeah and then build from 
[01:48:30]  there yeah you know and then you just gotta know when you make your mark i was there to i was there  to pay my bills so when i made my mark i didn't want to go up for the 20 000. but you can make more  why would you leave it was it was called earning a living right which in poker terms we call people like  that grinders and i don't like being a grinder it doesn't interest me i have no interest that's  why i want to play poker every day in my life i will lose my total want to even play yeah yeah  poker players are maniacs like the real professionals that will gamble on raindrops coming down a window 
[01:49:00]  yeah yeah they are uh they do those prop bets all day long yep all day like i remember daniel negrano  i remember hearing him betting some insane amount of money on a game of golf like there's golf wasn't he on  the show with you yes yeah yeah and that was the one who got a little bit of questioning well he  he just misinterpreted what i was saying right he thought i was talking about him he's got a very  large ego show oh that was just a great broadcast yeah i forgot joe uh and it went out a little bit  well it wasn't that he talked about me after the fact right and then i wrote a blog entry calling 
[01:49:30]  him a whiny and i posted up the actual the actual audio i was like this is what i said yeah and then  he actually apologized because he said he said he was emotionally invested in it and so he thought  what i was saying was something different than what i was saying he had like broken up or his  chick broke up with him at the time i was saying what i worry about right if i when when i break  up with the girl the first thing i think is her getting gorilla fucked by some savage that's what  she's gonna find some new dude he didn't like that at all yards of cock into her yeah he was listening to 
[01:50:00]  this he was he didn't want to hear it he was bothered he was saying that i was talking about  him like this is happening to your girlfriend i wasn't saying that at all every guy those things  that's what i'm i fear every time if i was in a relationship if the girl broke up i was like  oh she's getting fucked right now that's what i jerk off to that that's one way to get over the  relationship exactly oh she's catching something oh it's she's a bug catcher tell you one thing about 
[01:50:30]  that daniel agron you though for the last six years that guy's won probably an average of uh  two million or more just in tournament winnings he's with poker stars god knows what he gets he is  amazing as far as being able to call someone's hand he can read players he could read them yeah  what is that do you think that there's a psychic ability do you think it's just pattern recognition  is it intuition intuition intuition what is that it is it the pattern thing you said absolutely yeah  you gotta watch absolutely watch the pattern if you know if you see what what the person's betting 
[01:51:00]  if you see what's on the table um how many chips he has in the first place like all this comes into  play to try to figure out what he's got but also you got to watch the way they put out their chips  some guys they'll shove it out or and then all of a sudden you see them going like this so you got  to read these and watch and remember the hands and the pattern is foreign and that's when i can go after  somebody with the worst cards put them in for all their chips and they'll back off yeah there was a  a book written recently about pattern recognition and about when you you're involved in thousands and 
[01:51:30]  thousands of hours of things you start seeing things that other folks can't see which is one of the  reasons why some police interrogators are so good at spotting guilty people why you know like fighters  are so good at reading people's movements because you've seen so much over and over right such a wide  like a database of information that would make sense yeah well you know it's like you get to  they call they call them tells obviously in poker and i like i i was pretty eh at it and then someone 
[01:52:00]  said whenever i had a good hand they knew it because i would pop lock that's quite a tell you got there  you know that weird thing you know someone is about to do material on the radio you know that thing  like they're like a comic a shitty comic is about to do a joke yes and that's like a gross feeling  in your stomach the matter recognition the average person is not going to have any idea that's coming  right right absolutely if there's something about their eagerness or their you're right but you don't 
[01:52:30]  know what but you know it's a bit they're doing and not off the cuff and you want to just  throw boiling water on me what am i a college student driving to the gig i know what you're  doing oh it's so gross yeah have you had guys do that on the podcast yeah we used to hate having  comics on because that very thing well you're told to do that at some point like when i did the bob and  tom show the producer bob and tom didn't make me do this but the producer actually said what bits are  you going to talk about like what bits are you going to do what do you what do you want them to lead you 
[01:53:00]  into right and i was like what about a conversation yeah nothing how about none yeah when we were in  boston they would drag the comics in and the same they were just doing material and we're like let's  just talk that was the old school way of doing it it was right you had a limited amount of time to  be on the radio you knew you wanted people to come to your gig so you would just do a bunch of  that you knew for sure was funny and then we moved to new york and the comics were so different  down here and there were so many we were forced to take them again and it worked out thank god what 
[01:53:30]  was the difference between when the boston comics and new york comics i don't know i guess maybe we  got better maybe we were that couldn't have happened the way they parked the car but maybe maybe that  was it maybe we forced them out of their comfort zone i think like remember paulie shore one day  going was that the guy you were talking about the other day on the podcast i don't know maybe  i don't remember i forgot what i said i'll ask you off air but uh remember paulie shore was bombing so bad  and no way let's go back doesn't even make sense but this goes back to this this goes back to l.a when 
[01:54:00]  we first started doing radio together we didn't even know each other that well but we had some weird  chemistry we go out to l.a and paulie shore we were bombing we were we sucked and he he was just a  dick about it like a real cunt so i remember i put that in the back of my head and fast forward we're  now really doing well and he comes to any w and he's bombing horribly and he actually asked us to help him  out live on the air and we just i just folded my arms like continue buddy this is your time bombing 
[01:54:30]  go figure yeah it's just remember that though it must have been a rare occasion remember we got him  back though oh hell yeah we are back good i once said something like revenge is best served cold did  you say that i did say that and somebody took it and made a bumper sticker on and i saw that bumper  sticker he's right next to free tibet now yeah that's a really cool sentiment i'll say it i don't  fucking like that guy at all he's an acquired taste i've never liked paulie shore 
[01:55:00]  at the end of our run who gives a fuck paulie shore stop burning every bridge at the end of our run  are you guys at the end of your run i don't know what are you saying we're good we're good we're  gonna go who knows come on i want to go back to regular radio i hate all this freedom it's terrible  i like i like using euphemisms we'd have been fired oh of course you would have a million times  we were yeah exactly do you find if you do you guys do regular media sometimes and you forget that  you can't swear it's uh well you really got to be conscious of it like we will tie into brother 
[01:55:30]  weezer show and uh you're conscious of it you're constantly thinking don't don't say  fucker yeah i do kevin and bean in l.a sometimes and i every now and then a slip  will come out like it's just so natural yeah they have a delay though yeah luckily yeah that's  otherwise i think you get some massive fines which well it was it was what was it uh 30 000 to find  then that jizz bag michael cobs or michael powell put it up to 300 000 which made which 
[01:56:00]  made tenfold that's a struggle that strangled everybody strangled everybody now the law is like  fuck we can't literally we can't afford to pay that back in the old days they they kind of encouraged  the bad behavior because they knew it led to ratings and they would pay off the fcc once in a  while with a silly fucking number but it got to a point they couldn't because it was each instance  on every station remember they told us that so 300 if you say two dirty things on 10 stations  that's like 20 times 300 000 or whatever it was it was unreasonable completely strangled  the broadcaster by making that law it can break you and that's oh no yeah and now they don't allow 
[01:56:30]  anything and for what i mean what is the language the idea behind it is so ridiculous especially today  now that we've been exposed to so much freedom because of the internet and i mean how much has  society really changed well what's changed is we have more access to information we understand human  nature better we understand what people actually like and don't like 60 whatever percent of the world's  traffic is porn right i mean you find out what people are really into and yeah basically they're 
[01:57:00]  the same you interact with people the same way yeah and someone says fuck and it's the the top story  on these news stations they know how stupid it is but so stupid why don't they take that angle how  ridiculous this is that's why network tv is just going down the shitter and all these other stations and  other options that everybody has are doing so well yeah you know you get more options as well yeah and  even like young turks and things along those lines where people have like editorial capabilities right  and you can talk about stories like what the fuck is this guy saying right they can say things like 
[01:57:30]  that you're like yeah regular guys talking like a real human is speaking an opinion it's not some  corporate fucking sock puppet right amazing how all this uh media you know involvement or evolution of  media that has uh lowered the rates or change back when the beatles were on ed sullivan i think 73 million  people watched yeah yeah it's crazy yeah 73 million people to know your tv show today i'm happy to have  fucking i'm happy to have a tv show but yeah it's fucking 73 million that's the quote i saw i just saw 
[01:58:00]  yesterday was recorded on the on the tv and the number one show what does it do now not even 10 right  no i think no more than that yeah i think like big bang and those kind of shows they get like 18  and a good but they're horrendous yeah but i don't get it you know they're laughing all the way to the  thing typical jockeys that have been mellowed out by antidepressants and tuned right into that is that  it funny i think the best tv show on tv right now is true detective with matthew mcconaughey oh 
[01:58:30]  everybody's telling me to watch that yeah yeah i gotta blow you away i never saw that it's pretty good  you can't fuck with game of thrones game of thrones is yeah that's just great yeah you can't  fuck with game yeah that's one of those shows though that they'll pull off for  fucking two years and you got to sit there and wait yeah oh yeah they're making movies they're  making a movie every week oh are they i mean that's what it is yeah it's an hour movie every  week epic fucking movie every every week show it's the greatest show of all time is that king  fucking the king joffrey is the greatest most huggable tv character ever i fucking love that little 
[01:59:00]  that little who's the actor is brilliant yes yeah he's really good he's just such a good  cunt and an evil kind game hate him everyone's good on that show yeah there really is some amazing uh  amazing acting and the and the girl emily what's your name uh no no the one who plays the blonde  khaleesi oh man delightful girl everyone concurs yeah she is indeed hot oh yeah i really  fucking went on a limb there yeah a good game of thrones discussion and a fucking jersey idiot 
[01:59:30]  pipe saying with hey that girl's really pretty that's something that you say like the first  time you watch the show and it's season one but i'm acting like you know that's the big storyline  fucking putts absolute yes you are so what's what's in this book bruce buffer we want to sell you  we want to sell a few books for you today oh i appreciate that you know i was pretty honored with  brandon house came and uh you know brought me into their family with the book but it's basically 
[02:00:00]  a story of life love the pursuit of happiness the story is a mother son story a father son story and  it's a story of my life but i've owned my own companies and been an entrepreneur endeavor since  i was 19 and um it evolved into where my experience and and uh everything i've done with the ufc which is  going on 18 years now wow jesus and uh big part of the story too is we all know who my brother is the  legendary michael buffer let's get ready to rumble get out of here yeah get out of here come on what 
[02:00:30]  but what a lot of people don't know is that we did not grow up together um like i said earlier my  grandfather's named johnny buff he's in the history books he was the bantamweight flyweight champion of  the world in 1921 and bert sugar who passed away a couple years ago called him the greatest fighter in  1921 so do you have pictures of him like this yeah yeah oh he used to be he did very difficult  all right school put your dukes up yeah put up your dukes he did that kind of fighting with the  unlimited rounds you know when you were 20 30 rounds that kind of thing pummeling each other yeah  but um uh with that being said uh i was watching boxing out of the womb my dad had me just i mean 
[02:01:00]  here's here it is son you know i i got a baby bottle one hand of boxing on the tv and the other  so uh when the usc came on the scene i put michael in it but the thing is is that 25 years ago i was  watching boxing and out came this debonair pretty boy uh and looking with the james bond style saying  let's get ready to rumble and and they said buffer on the bottom of the screen and i own telemarketing  companies in my 20s and like a lot of us you look in the phone book to see your last name i never saw  my last name anywhere so i got this weird feeling in my stomach and long story cut short over a year 
[02:01:30]  and a half i finally got tired of people coming up to me and saying who is this guy is that your brother  wow and i'm like no my brother is brian the the man i grew up with so i'm driving up north with my  dad and i tell him what's going on and he's driving and i'm 29 years old and he turns around he's i think  that's your brother holy i go if i was driving the car i would have gone off the side of the road  that's fucking fascinating that you did not know who's your brother i had no until 29 yeah 29.  why is he saying i think that's your brother because they had not seen each other since he was two and a 
[02:02:00]  half my dad admitted to me my dad was married he passed away five years ago but he was married for 57 years to my  mom wow and i never knew he was married before and during world war ii when he was serving in the  pacific he married at the age of 20 went overseas when he came back nine months later his son was born  and then michael was raised by foster parents uh under a different name and he was never formally  adopted and when he went in the army they said you're not this you're buffer right so that not  happened i probably wouldn't be sitting here because finally when we met each other um i own two 
[02:02:30]  companies i was doing quite well but i had no passion for what i was doing and i'm a very passionate guy  and everything i do and i just had an epiphany i went to the riddick bow holyfield fight 19 19  november 13 1992 i'll never forget it thomas and max center i watched everybody from hulk hogan to  jack nicholson losing it when my brother would with his great voice and then go into the rumble and i  thought there's something here and he doesn't he doesn't quite get it yet right nobody had trademarked  the phrase um nobody made a hat or a t-shirt you know the usual stuff and at the time you remember when 
[02:03:00]  pat riley and the lakers won three three p yeah three p well the big deal was how he trademarked  three p and they quoted how he made like a million and a half dollars and so my brain starts thinking  okay well we need to trademark this and michael did get a trademark but not properly so i did all my  research everything i trademarked it and we went on to uh i said look i'm going to sell these two  companies i want to become your manager but i want to become your partner when i create things like 
[02:03:30]  video games or toys which i wrote three pages of notes that night of that fight i went back to my  hotel room and i just had the epiphany go off my head and i kept writing and writing i want to do  this do this put them on the football field the basketball court movies tv blah blah blah blah  and i said listen to make you richer more famous you ever dreamed hopefully myself in the process  and i would like to be an announcer um because i'd done motivational speaking i'm used to being on  stage and stuff like that and and he said well we agreed that boxing was not the place to announce  there's no money in it he's the only one making any money i said great something will come along  you gotta wait i just started working managing his career for 20 years now let me ask you if you 
[02:04:00]  had to guess at what that how much money that one phrase has made in in all markets come how much  would you think that phrase has made overall we have sold almost 425 million dollars in products  in retail sales with let's get ready to rumble on that holy that's not in my pocket that's not  that's not my pocket that's a fucking mind-boggling for one phrase basically yes that's the that's the the  pumped up number with the actual number of income that i don't discuss how do you throw out the 
[02:04:30]  giant number i'll tell you what joe tell me how much you made last year i'll tell you how much i  made well i bet it's not 400 million bucks no i said it's not it's not but i mean what i'm saying  i mean why would i you know right these are crazy numbers because that's that's it's a crazy number  that's this documented from the sales of the different thing we've got a video game that sold  quite well um we were part of the remember the dreamcast module that came out oh yeah console  we were one of 10 games i went to midway and created this game with them called ready to rumble 
[02:05:00]  boxing and my whole idea was arcade style characters and they would have a life of their own that came  out on the dreamcast and in 24 hours the dreamcast and the 10 games sold like 97 and a half million in  retail sales which is not part of that quote that i'm using um and hollywood reporter variety said that  has set the entertainment record for the most salesman entertainment product in 24 hours which  is honorable to say that we were part of that because we were one of the 10 games that came  out with the machine right i fucking i need a good phrase i've been trying let me tell you something 
[02:05:30]  about trademark phrases but here's the thing about trade people don't get this get ready to stumble  yes we are we are we've already used that we actually want to get somebody legal for let's  get ready to stumble and cease and desist them paraphrasing you gotta you can only do so much but the  thing is people think you could trademark anything you've got to show usage and michael had years of  usage right which allowed us to lock down i can't even think about how much money i've spent on  attorneys and trademarks over the years but you have to show usage you can't get it and then the 
[02:06:00]  other thing is is if somebody violates it and takes it from you have to protect it or the government  could take it back and say you know you're not using it properly there's a story in the book too about  how uh i miss who i you know we love but uh was using that phrase and uh there was a huge uh oh yeah he's  on tv now um why the on fox business i know but why i don't know oh see don imus yeah that's one of  the guys we had a big hassle with don imus actually that's what you're saying don imus at one point i 
[02:06:30]  write about it in the book yes and don imus uh would play his voice so i sent a letter to him you  know explaining we have his trademarked uh love your show congratulations but please don't use it call me  anytime be happy to license it to you so i go in the cleaners i come back from the ufc and i'm in  the cleaners and they said well you know you're on the radio you're mentioning on don imus's show what  are you talking about he read my letter on the air he didn't read the nice part he just read it because  i got i got a letter from some jerk named bruce buffett and then he does it and then he plays my 
[02:07:00]  brother's voice i guess i guess we're not supposed to but you know who cares and he played it right  so then i sent him a lawsuit you know i sent him a copy of the lawsuit to my attorney said look don  i'm going to file this if you do this again please don't what's that like that's an intent  when they write up a possible suit what's that called it's it's it's then you're not filing yet  but it's the no it's an intent it's okay you're sending him a draft of what it happened it's kind  of like the guy knocking on your door say don't pay the bills we're going to break your legs you know  we would have done the exact same thing by the way so what happened we would have read the letter 
[02:07:30]  and played it again how many times have we done that i can't go into detail about this but here's  one of the scariest parts is that michael called me from new york one about six in the morning  california time and he basically did you know we're being sued that's what he's talking about  he goes infinity broadcasting and don heinouser suing to free up the trademark for public domain  which would have killed our business if that happened to a certain extent i i don't have the  kind of money to to fight them but i sent my attorneys in a countersuit and we settled in our  favor within three days and you know it's you got to stand up for what's right is the uh david and 
[02:08:00]  goliath routine it's amazing that they backed off too which or i'm assuming they did but that's  that's really good because you can't it's hard to litigate with these big companies because they can  fucking they can litigate forever with emotions and all this shit yeah they can kill you because  they've got the money but the bottom line is if it's yours you have to fight for what's yours  i need a phrase uh i just got worried ricky's 10 minutes out so we should maybe take a break  so yeah all right um well bruce's book is and i'm not being polite it's really good uh it's a really  good book it's called it's time and uh bruce handed me a copy backstage last time at ufc and that was 
[02:08:30]  why i started uh reading i didn't know you had a book out what a crazy story man it's unbelievable  you always wonder if you have another sibling out there well i had was in oklahoma recently  and this guy came up to me that worked in the hotel and he had a name tag that said buffer he said oh i've  been waiting to meet you and i go whoa yeah not another one i don't really with all respect have a great  life i i hope you enjoy yourself but please no i could use i could use a few bucks yeah wow yeah 
[02:09:00]  i hope i have a brother out there somewhere and he's not some creep it's interesting bruce that  you're so much different than your brother too and your style your style is so perfect for the ufc oh yeah  yeah it's like such a different explosive energetic really aggressive style you know there's nobody like  you man that mood i've said it many times on the air but when you're like announcing like a big fight  like the i get goosebumps like when you know it's a anderson silver chris weidman or something like  that i get goosebumps yeah yeah you make you make the whole the the whole beginning of the fight so 
[02:09:30]  much more there's so much more drama you get everyone thank you joe you know that's coming  from a guy like joe who i respect tremendously and we've been we've done each other for years  that's a huge compliment i'm not all about the money yeah i'll be the first one to cash a paycheck at  the bank but just a pat on the back and hearing from joe who again i respect so tremendously that just  means the world to me now you talk about me and give me a check and i'm fine  well i guarantee you that comes saturday night um with henna burrell and uriah favor 
[02:10:00]  ovarim and frank mere uh and of course jose aldo who to me is like anderson silva you know at a  lower weight i mean and ricardo llamas and ricardo llamas there's so many good fights saturday night  these three i'm going to be going off i'm just i'm going to go train today i'm going to get a lot of  sleep and i just want to go off in the octagon and honor these great warriors it's an amazing  experience i i just can't tell you i kiss the ground every time i wake up every day that i have  this chance to walk in that octagon it really is the best i've said this about joe too it's 
[02:10:30]  you're the best announcer and joe is the best joe's the best uh you know uh well i don't say  play-by-play but whatever it is that you think i'm a color calling the five color guy and and bruce  is the best absolutely that's a huge part of what makes the usc successful i could not imagine the usc  without joe rogan i mean when you when you think about joe and joe's basically a mixed martial  artist himself the man has a tremendous background in fighting sports you know accomplished martial  artist there's not and i know stay joe i've watched all these other shows and i'll watch the  announcers something commentates like him he he sets everything up so much for the people that don't 
[02:11:00]  understand what's what's happening and for those that do yeah he's got a genuine understanding what's  going on in there i like no i mean i like i like also the fact that you will predict what the hell  is going to happen in the ring which is odd like all of a sudden it's like oh yeah he's he he does  this and that and then you'll see it so i think it has a pattern recognition thing that we're talking  about we were just talking about yeah you've seen so many fights and situations or uh-oh he doesn't seem 
[02:11:30]  to be watching his right side or something and boom it's like well see i told you yeah it's all so  bruce's booklet i want to plug it probably yeah it's time when you're in brazil by the way the entire  audience does that yeah when he does it when he does it's time like in america they haven't caught on  but brazilian fans there is no fans like brazilian fans there's no fans in the world that are more  aggressive more passionate more enthusiastic but when he does it like the whole crowd like 18 000 
[02:12:00]  people it's time they all join in and cheer and scream crazy i'll tell you something funny the  first time that happened when we first went to brazil under the zufa regime uh there was literally about  eighteen twenty thousand and i got out of the octagon because when i'm in the octagon my eyes are looking  into the eye of the tiger i block out the audience i'm only looking at the fighters i'm so in my moment  you know wanting to enhance them and hopefully perform and enhance the crowd and the fans because  the show's not about me i'm just there to do what i do and then stitch the famous cut man he goes did 
[02:12:30]  you hear that i go hear what he goes the whole audience said it with you i go no but i got home  and watched it on the video and oh my god i was going away that's pretty crazy every time now how  much money have you made off it's time don't say it don't tell him don't say it you're not going to sue us  are you no no i'm not going to see you but i've already got my taxes for last year i don't need  any more questions okay ricky's on his way up so thank you very much and i'll see you tomorrow  bruce buffer all right thank you gentlemen the best he's the best people ricky gervais joins the program

[02:14:30]  so 96 for him you know it's like uh the people in america might not yell along with it and stuff but  i've had the pay-per-views of my house a lot of times during parties and stuff and everyone in the  house just walks around going fighting yeah it's time you gotta do the impression have you ever seen  the buffer 360 yes yeah of course that's fucking genius so really fast before ricky how would you  think his brothers made a lot a lot i want to get him to say it but it's a lot of money it's millions 
[02:15:00]  and millions of dollars probably as ricky gervais how are you take a seat sir joe rogan nice to meet  brother yeah rogan yeah it's millions of millions of dollars for sure yeah absolutely what's up rick  we've decided we decided i made it you did when you're still on air and we're still here i can't  believe that's years that confusion i just thought i just just kept thinking they're rude whenever i  turn up they leave we would leave we we actually adjusted the time of our show i think so we could 
[02:15:30]  finally interview you proper just for ricky gervais we go to 10 30 now we go to 10 30 yeah exactly  because we've had problems with other guys that wanted to come here we're like man we like you and  anyone else you just want to go home after a while jimmy and sam would interview ricky because  ricky could only come in after 10 and then we'd leave and ricky's told by everybody else that he's  on the opie and anthony show and he'd come in and be like well where the are they you know and we were  long gone i'm listening to the show camper yeah i'm listening to the show on my drive home going like 
[02:16:00]  and then i had to call in one day and go look you're coming after the show i go jay leno doesn't  doesn't stay late for guests this is the time of the show now i understand now we're all square  now i'm even earlier than i need to i know you really are a little earlier than that's good we like  seeing you i i got i think i'm gonna i i gotta curse you out because i you're in a muppets movie  that means i'm gonna have to i'm gonna have to hear you for at least a hundred times i know i got 
[02:16:30]  two young kids these movies drive you insane after a while you gotta play over and over you  know play them over and over again over and over and i love the first movie i absolutely did  but i think eventually i think i'm gonna end up hating you oh this is this is good though  is it good i saw it um yeah uh a screen in sunday and i was blown away it's really really good  and also because i'm not usually an active harder i'd sort of do my own thing and so  uh when you've when you've done it but you you you're not in charge it's a whole different set 
[02:17:00]  of neuroses and fears yeah you're usually in charge of your own stuff yeah if you see ricky on tv  ricky produced the whole thing my first fear was that i wouldn't be in it oh yeah yeah you didn't  make it nothing nothing you did you know what though in the dvd extras you're gonna be a big hit in the  expert you're a tweet yeah all your best stuff is now a tweet no but it's great it's really funny  i'm gonna love it the first 10 times i see it after that because these kids they just 
[02:17:30]  have to see these movies over and over and over again i went uh uh with my ex-girlfriend years  ago out to colorado and hang out with her sister and brother-in-law and they had kids uh and they  would pop in uh monsters inc all the time and this is right when like the second gulf war was  really heating up and i was just i'm on cnn and fox news the whole time and i remember one  they were they were like a scud missile uh alert is being and and they just pop in a video of 
[02:18:00]  monsters inc again and i'm like there's a but there's a war do you understand there's a war i want to see  what's happening with the war yeah but then wars get pretty samey as well yes they do you make a  valid point there yeah the wars get a little samey and we got it late like just like we get everything  like because it because it was good for american time it was our good war it's 3 a.m we had to 
[02:18:30]  watch the gulf war like in the middle of the night so uh yeah yeah samey i was watching a clip uh  the other day uh you posted on twitter it's that clip where you're trying to be all smooth with the  the soda in the bottle yeah with the girl and extras and extras it was from extras god damn was  fucking fun thank you very much are we just ignoring the fact there's two people in here taking pictures  yeah yeah this is very odd we're we're we're at the level we're just kind of used to it at a level 
[02:19:00]  we don't even notice showed up with cameras i know everyone's saying hi to anybody i didn't see  everything's gotta be online you can't do anything now it's all gotta be online we're used to her i  don't who are you what yes why are you whispering what are you just saying leave him alone okay get  i assume it's something something official as opposed to he just wandered in  but no one's question that could happen too yeah it has happened before the bigger the camera the 
[02:19:30]  bigger the uh slr there the the more important the photographers the more you could sneak in  you're like oh this guy's got to be somebody that is true badge he asked me to sign catcher in the rye  outside so and it's the depressing part is he's snapping all these great getty photos and i know  that i'm being blocked by anthony so i'm not going to be in any of the great getty photos oh no we're  never in them back in my head i don't care and put it this way jimmy they don't they're not taking  your pictures taking photos of the burgada on february 15th i will be at the late show yeah yeah oh yeah 
[02:20:00]  but i know i i know i'm not going to take them with me but i'd like to be in one accidentally like  there's your face who's that with him oh this young up and comer i missed you on them the the  what you did um leno again didn't you how did that go it was good it was just a segment it was i say  just segment but it wasn't like my own segment it was like me and a couple of other guys it was  don't play it down jimmy no but i admit it wasn't like my own panel segment and that was my last one  with jay i think he's done now so what's going on jimmy fallon's taking over yeah yeah yeah yeah he'll 
[02:20:30]  do well jimmy's perfect for that you know and uh you know him and kim are not going to fight it out  he's good i like jimmy fallon he's good he's nice to do he's always up it's a nice atmosphere  and he hasn't hands in his sort of comedy card just because he's a you know he's  in those comedy bits yeah yeah i think he'll do great he will do great he's great with the  internet like i think so yeah i think he loves it i mean he's like a big kid you see it but i think  yeah he does seem sincere that he does like jaded oh he won't you won't be allowed to look him in the  eye you're gonna hear those stories yeah yeah he doesn't even talk to any of them i've done brick 
[02:21:00]  looking two thousand of these things i hate everyone yeah i want i want the audio that somebody got on  their phone of jimmy fallon and if that motherfucker comes over to me one more yeah losing it completely  blows his image he used to be such a nice guy now he walks by and he throws a cup of his own urine on  his writers drink it drink it drink some fallon love be like me yeah he is still enjoying it and 
[02:21:30]  he's got the right vibe for it so it's i find the fascinating thing that jay leno the forcing him  out thing it's happened so many times it really is like the second version what is it about him total  disrespect i don't know it just seems because he's not going away but doesn't he keep delivering the  the writings yeah that's what why it's strange that's why it's a great point demographic or  something they were no you've got all the wrong people watching there's just millions of them but 
[02:22:00]  none of them that we like well you laugh about that but that is a thing that some people do worry  about it because of their advertisers so some people say no they're we want people to buy cars  that watches these people are buying pizzas and right and being the largest amish audience would  be a problem right well i remember when the um they did the remake of um uh the the office as we  call it in england you call it the english office and um and it was it wasn't doing very well but then  they found out their demographic was great they found out that they had the highest something like 
[02:22:30]  people earning over a hundred thousand dollars a year so then they're like oh okay let's keep it  because even though it was small it was perfect right and then that that grew so they do care  they even care about who's watching it like oh we're getting 10 million yeah but they're the wrong  10 million it used to just be sheer numbers exactly yeah yeah now it's broken it down to do with  advertising yeah unless it's totally yeah and then they don't care but they just they've been  paid anyway yeah i think the audience they're seeking might not watch that format of tv anymore 
[02:23:00]  though because they were 18 to 35 or 18 to 40 is is the the i guess the ideal male whatever but i  think a lot of those guys are not because jay had even said he was winning in those demos with the  young he was winning the younger demos he was beating he was beating letterman in the younger demo so so i  think that this massive influx of young people that they expect it's hard to get because they're all  online and they're not they're not really watching late night tv yeah well that's it isn't it everything 
[02:23:30]  goes online now as well yeah everything you could see before you have to watch it on television at this  point well yeah exactly yeah yeah you can you can it can literally be on youtube before it went out  before it goes out on tv yeah because they want but then what i don't get that if it's out there  yeah and saying watch this look it's in now and that oh good i can watch it on telly tonight but  i've just watched it yeah why would i bother programs are on yeah true before yeah yeah before you know  yeah and a lot of people just going to the internet for their shows you were you were on seinfeld's show 
[02:24:00]  recently with the comedians and cars yeah which is doing really well that's not on regular tv yeah  but that i think he's had a cumulative like 25 million wow you know those 10 minutes things that  that's like a huge yeah yeah yeah and it's and it's global were you really that scared in the car  yeah i'm not i'm not a good traveler i'm not not good but i've got a listen right here's the thing okay  i can be in a modern car and it can be going 75 miles an hour and you think you're pooting along 
[02:24:30]  mm-hmm in a car like that from the 60s no suspension no airbags it's like being dragged  along in a tin bucket every little bump you feel like you're about an inch off the road it's  honestly and he's obviously found out that he's scaring someone so he's laughing like a maniac oh  he was having a great petrified i never expected that from seinfeld but he really enjoys  you know yeah i found this real oh wow he's he's evil that's the appeal of those old cars the the  tactile feeling yeah yeah yeah steering you literally feel the gears moving in the gear 
[02:25:00]  yeah you know even i i i'm i'm not big on cars but i see you know it's aesthetically beautiful  but to drive it it's not good no no it seems good on paper and then when you drive them you realize  you're like where's my escalate yeah i want to i need some fancy accoutrement exactly yeah modern  muscle cars it's one of the coolest things about like the modern mustangs and modern cars like that  you get a lot of what is fun about those old cars the low-end grunt and the loud noise and the 
[02:25:30]  ridiculous horsepower yeah but they actually have brakes and yeah they actually can turn they don't  fucking slide off the road like a rhino on roller skates yeah well i did put mine into a guardrail  did you recently yeah no this is a couple of years ago a muscle car combined with extreme  alcoholism you know winds up the same way every time you took a shelby gt 500 you jacked it up like  800 horsepower or something ridiculous i had a kenny belch kit put on it and i was it was called the road 
[02:26:00]  was a little sandy and it was a curve it was perfect and then i decided that was the time to maybe give  a little boost the thing just went spun and i'm like it's amazing how long you're in that spin until  you hit something because you you literally go through like i think i'm all right i could spin out  of this i could just be facing the other way i oh i'm going that way now oh shit there's the guardrail  oh i wonder what this is going to feel like yeah yeah what's this going to feel is it going to be 
[02:26:30]  little or is it going to like bam really be oh that was hard okay yeah yeah yeah yeah i want to be  dead immediately i don't want to wake up with like loads of tubes around that and they go i can't feel  my legs now you're just a head oh yeah yes i'm in a bucket i'm just i'm just a head in a bucket jesus  christ it's frightening you because you don't know what it's going to be and then yeah wham hit the 
[02:27:00]  side i was like the thought of pain is the scariest thing yeah i i just don't yeah i didn't want to like  oh this is bad total it no no i up the front end you did a pretty good job and and yeah the whole side  kind of it hit like this and then went down the guardrail ripped up the side no frame damage no  no frame damage it was the front end was fucked though and so immediately you went from food for  your life to oh yeah yeah but uh yeah i got that all taken care of so but it was it was definitely my 
[02:27:30]  fault those tires and the power isn't made for cold it was cold and sandy it's a silly car  it is a silly car on on a track or on a straight run it's fucking amazing it's amazing i took it to  pocono that time and took it around the track a couple of times poking a raceway fuck 
[02:28:00]  you just see the boost go up the turbo charge it sounds like a jet engine  and and then you're kind of like this is so cool oh my god i could die so easily right now i could die  it wouldn't take anything i hate when he tells stories like that because i just i see my mortgage going  down the toilet i'm like will you drive under 80 miles an hour every time he comes in like i had  up to 120 last night i just see the show going away tragedy and then they show my face moving out of  my apartment they go yeah how do you feel i'm devastated devastated devastated for reasons i 
[02:28:30]  don't want to go into but i am devastated just use the soundbite i'm absolutely devastated and that will  cover whatever you want me to say it'll cover all i have to find a new place what's his name uh oh my god  oh that's funny yeah uh and also your your tweets uh of course are fucking people love them you are  one of the most unapologetic people on uh twitter which is great i'm sorry on the inside you but it 
[02:29:00]  seems like at some points and this is what i love it when you read the first few lines it's like is  ricky apologizing for something or is ricky like like showing some sympathy for these holy rollers or  whoever it would be and then at the end you just fuck them in the ass with a little twist i think you  mean the one when i said um if anyone's ever been offended i'd like to say i'm so sorry for you  being a humorless cunt yeah it's like oh he's oh no see he's not yeah they look at it like it's a 
[02:29:30]  nice little journey and then there's cunt waiting at the end right i should just say as i'm in america  that there's no misogyny in that word for me no no no not at all it's very different for you it's not  at all in fact it's the opposite we very we very rarely use it to describe it because it's just too much  it's for guys yeah it's guys and it's often the term of endearment i'd right that's difficult to  explain um uh uh yeah on twitter to an american but it's honestly we we once i was in um i told  this i was in scotland and this scottish copper county says hey mr devise he said you're a funny 
[02:30:00]  cunt you're a funny cunt and you said thank you thank you very much exactly yeah how could a word have  two i think australians use it as a like meanies like that yeah yeah yeah that's the adam bomb in  america but yeah yeah but also if you're just guys hanging out the closer you are as friends  and the longer you know each other the worse you could talk about each other yeah it's always the  way if you just meet someone for the first time you're not going to go hey you're a  fucking asshole but your buddy how many times do you call your buddy an asshole you should ever you 
[02:30:30]  don't ever use that word if you really mean it or you don't really well you don't mean it right  yeah it depends on the relationship my friend joey diaz if he loves you he calls you a cocksucker  there you go come here cocksucker yeah and he loves you and in prison that they really do love  you when they love you they call you the same yes that was my nickname is i clean the cell and wash the  socks but that's the kind of stuff that's the intuition and weird things in language like we just 
[02:31:00]  understand there's no way to explain that on paper like no when you say to somebody hey cocksucker it  we just understand what it means by where it's coming from well that's why it's so gross when  people take yeah take things out of context and print them out as a written word and then it's  like of course that looks bad but it's all about intent it's intent yes otherwise they're squiggles  on paper they're lines but people have taken that away of course and and it's all context people get in  the way and they've got their own little worries and foibles and they can't see the wood for the trees 
[02:31:30]  they can't see yeah you're persecuted now target yeah something that they know that though they're  pretending they do they're pretending that there's no subtlety in language oh yeah yeah people want  a bit of controversy the fake outrage yeah ridiculous and twitter's like oh yeah even worse yeah i love  some good fake outrage it's great well at least msnbc stands tall jesus yeah they just apologize well they  just can't stop saying they're sorry what's the story for the people out there the bbc apologizing they've got 
[02:32:00]  shareholders in there and you know the papers are at them and you know they're they're accountable  what are they projects for everything oh everything you know i i've been told that i i i haven't put  stuff in they go we're worried about that and i go what are you worried about and they go it could  be taken the wrong way i said well there's i'll stand up and i i'll i'll write the letter for you  because sometimes they just don't want to have to write the letter oh right admin i was told once how  lazy that's unbelievable did this thing and it was um uh a thing about a guy who was pretending to be 
[02:32:30]  deaf okay and they set off a fire alarm and see if he'd you know run away right it was and they  and um uh totally justified i won't give it totally justified and they said to me oh he said the deaf  are very active can you have a go at the blind like it should purely because that give us some not not  whether the merit of the the joke is justified right we get letters we get more letters from  the deaf than they hate getting letters really that means you're doing well plus if the blind write 
[02:33:00]  a letter it's like half on the paper and it just goes off you can't really read it very well  but that that that is literally what will spark out the networks to react is it what they think the  blowback will be yeah like duck dynasty proved the fraudulence of it because they went out and they  said uh we're yanking phil robertson when the blowback came from people who supported phil  robertson it was stronger they put him back on there's not an ounce of sincerity no no no one's 
[02:33:30]  ever sorry they don't even wait to see what that's going to go no that's what's amazing to me well how  could that even be shocking the entire show is fake and scripted yeah you know why would it be shocking  that their response is fair like suburban fucking college and he's supposed to say stuff like that  obviously yeah that's right no that's his thing i mean he's he's done that long before the show  morning and christian and they're just guy right serious bible banger what's the msnbc thing for  the people jerry well this month they've apologized for everything the groveling on air apology that 
[02:34:00]  that woman gave uh with the woman with the lisp and then the uh what's this i don't know about this  melissa harris perry yeah there was a picture that was the uh mitt romney the mitt romney family  photo with the black kid yeah there's a black like adopted child in the mitt romney family photo and msnbc  they said something they made some jokes they were very light-hearted one of these things is not  like the other kind of joke um a panel that they had uh when they showed it was pretty harmless it  was harmless but uh she apologized she apologized and cried as she's apologizing yeah it was like 
[02:34:30]  that she should have known better yeah we don't think that biracial families are funny like it was  just so because she's from she's from a biracial uh that's what it is unnecessary as you watch these  apologies you're like this is nothing this is unnecessary completely insincere most apologies  are after someone's just trying to save their job or or what have you yeah well of course yeah yeah  yeah it's it's pressure isn't it and then the latest one was uh i guess somebody at msnbc had tweeted out  uh something that said well i guess the right uh the right is going to be angry at cheerios again because 
[02:35:00]  they got another mixed-race commercial uh that they're putting out and uh i guess the republican  the republicans are going to get mad about it while liberals are going to go like oh look at the cute  interracial family or something like or biracial family pretty much got it the intent wasn't to be  hateful they were just kind of shitting on the conservatives uh the republicans sent off a  letter that said we are not doing any interviews on msnbc you will not get one of our guys uh and they 
[02:35:30]  fired the person who did it and apologized they fired the person apology it was nothing really i  mean uh it's just meanwhile they hardly have conservatives on either the truth of the matter  is i don't think the the right does like that mixed race cheerio commercial i'll say it i don't think  they do like it i think it's that now everyone has a has a platform yes social media and and and  and now even real news reads tweets yeah and now people even report other people's reports so they 
[02:36:00]  say well so and so didn't like it which is the most irrelevant piece of information i've ever heard in  my life yes you know when it comes down to opinion i don't care what hearsay of someone's opinion is  i only care what yours is so we can discuss it all you know but now everyone's worried it's everything's  um uh not not just a a popularity contest but um it is it it's it's um i suppose buckling under  pressure it is whoever shouts the loudest will win because people want an easy life it's a way to get 
[02:36:30]  your message out there it's a way to show that you're a powerful uh unit if you have an organization  or something and you're outraged that something now you have a voice you used to have to go through  a lot of channels to to voice your uh right now you just now you just tweet it out where we are  outraged and then the news picks it up and look who's outraged exactly yeah and it becomes like  real news right reporting on what people think or reporting tweets they don't read tweets on cnn 
[02:37:00]  like rick what does anyone had a show and that he was there was like tweets pop they base news on  tweets and then they come back and go we received erroneous or some people are reporting erroneously it's  like no you did it's also this this this insatiable desire to hear about what the man in the street  has to say i don't want it no there's a reason he's in the street right no no no no but but even on  news they have a big story then they have like five vox pops people just going to work i saw one the 
[02:37:30]  other day right it was they were slowing trains down because they've been a crash okay and uh and they  said uh well let's hear what the uh opinion is on the man on the street and this uh one bloke said uh  well it's awful he said it already takes me an hour and a half to get to work so you know that's  going to be another two hours in a day so it's terrible they go what do you think they go well  it's a good thing because it you know you know it's it's it's safety and it's where it's just annoying  for the computers and then and it went this woman she went i'd rather arrive at work um late than 
[02:38:00]  dead she actually said that yeah yeah yeah well that'd be good wouldn't it like turning you're  early but you're dead what was i was hoping for some overtime no you can't give overtime i mean  well how is that useful and they let that in you know it's better to arrive late than dead yeah thanks  thanks they they're just out of news they've run out of the ability hours a long time broadcast 24  hours of news so they they just well without talking about things that they're not really 
[02:38:30]  supposed to be talking about yeah yeah well real stories yeah real real corruption involved in our  government man when you had a half hour or an hour newscast once a day at 6 p.m. or something  they were like peers let's go with the latest in the war it's monsters inc coupon  what's the same what happened watching the news there's a war wrong can you picture walter cronkite  a tweet sent by kanye west no exactly the news does say tweet us tweet us what you think they 
[02:39:00]  certainly will remember to find me on facebook yeah we're just follow us or tweet us what you think  the opinions of the audience should not be pertinent to the news at all it's irrelevant you should just be  reporting it uh in an unbiased fact by the way bloggers just got the same protection in a court  case that the media has and i'm really happy about that even though bloggers can be annoying it really  knocks down the media's uh ability to a little bit because they're not a blogger's not the same 
[02:39:30]  protection everyone's the media now yeah everyone yeah everyone really is we are the everyone's reporting  we don't know where it came from or where it started or who's in charge but everyone is the media  their own stuff everyone's the media and i said it before everyone is the nsa everyone's like  snapping pictures and posting them and ratting each other out and i i said it before we've turned  out to be our own big brother we thought there was going to be some government entity with cameras 
[02:40:00]  and and watching our every move and then it just turned out to be all of us ourselves the second  something happens oh and then it gets posted now you're like why did you do now i'm at my job because  i put on some inappropriate halloween costume or something it's like so who was the guy that  took the picture and put it online it wasn't some entity or agency it's just all of us  each other yeah twitter we're yeah we're two idiots outnumber a genius that's it we voted you're the  idiot really yeah that's it yeah we did this number that's it it's a number no e numbers squared not 
[02:40:30]  according to us too nope and uh we're the guys we deserve it i i literally when the nsa scandal broke  it didn't bother me because it's to me people are such nosy pigs it really when tiger woods's personal  stuff leaked not one person stood up and defended his privacy or gibson's phone call they love it so  when now it's happening to all and i get like the government's the guy they shouldn't do it but 
[02:41:00]  it made me very happy like good you're pigs they're listening to our calls they're reading  our emails you feel entitled to everyone else's information so now you see now i hope you're  fucking enjoying the scumbags you've got you've really got to get this sorted out before you become  really famous yeah because the that's waiting to come out of you is going to be devastating  honestly i've said the closet is so full of information so much has been falling out already  i know yeah i don't think there'll be a surprise yeah people things that skeletons buried in your 
[02:41:30]  literally please in your closet and stuff and uh when that comes out you've got to get these these  super injunctions being you know it won't hurt me because literally jimmy writes himself out yes  yeah they're going to do interview 400 trannies like how many times can you hear the same story  he pretended he didn't know but i know he did you know what i mean what are they going to get me 
[02:42:00]  you're not supposed to say tranny anymore oh i know that but you know i've been such a friend of  the community i'll withstand the criticism i don't know it's just another scandal i don't know about  i yeah you've offended you've offended transgender i don't know i've i know i put a lot of them  through college oh god i don't know what to believe anymore four hundred dollars at a times  don't believe it right being a comic is you're lucky you can say that you know yeah doesn't matter 
[02:42:30]  be tough action if you were a teacher what's that it'd be tough action if you were a teacher yeah and i  even said it to the audience like i know that the crowd doesn't have the same ability we do as  comedians like they can't just upload what they want because their jobs are different and the  penalties for them you know i know that they can't but i say just don't don't be a part of the pylon  like somehow you can you can still write a blog defending someone's right to be inappropriate  like you don't have to behave that way as an executive because you can't but just don't sit  there silently while they're you know what i mean there's a way to do that i'm just boring 
[02:43:00]  there are no they're allowed to stop the flow of the conversation i just really talk for a good  long and comfortable time he gets so uncomfortable i love it yeah i don't know how to have the floor  my shame just comes up and i can't possibly be interested in what i'm saying i clear my throat  two seconds into my aria all right go ahead you go i have to add the right to my opinions but i just don't  deserve now you're also on on uh i see on twitter uh such a great animal uh activist and lover well 
[02:43:30]  oh oh boy you'll love uh uh your little domestic uh pets which you you have pictures of they're  adorable yeah i like that i'm a bit of a strange old cat lady i've turned into but um that's that's  often something to tweet really yeah yeah but the the animal activism is somewhat different i mean  it's the only thing that sort of that and religious intolerance is the only thing that makes my blood  boil the uh yeah animal cruelty i've never understood yeah i've never understood it i've never understood 
[02:44:00]  the fun in watching an animal tortured like a bullfight or badger baiting or dog i've no i i don't  know what's going on in the yeah their minds of someone who who would enjoy that really tradition i  guess true the bullfight's a strange one it's very strange yeah because it's such a cruel tradition  it's yeah that thing about it's a tradition that doesn't hold any water with me it's no so with  slavery what what you're talking about no it's not exactly it doesn't hold water it's a strange  tradition yeah yeah it's a strange thing to do in it so ricky james is saying bring back slavery is that 
[02:44:30]  what i just tweeted i tweet it before you can recant  whether he recanted after he knows the horrendous i don't want to make it compulsory  it's an option exactly all right like like gay married it's not compulsory but it should be  allowed between two consulting he comes in from a very open-minded point of view yeah consenting adults  they're going to call them long-term interns jim is often a volunteer he said i want to be the slave 
[02:45:00]  absolutely yes that's true and miss you strap that right on and teach me a lesson yeah jesus  miss daisy miss daisy what a huge cock you've got yes and piggly wiggly is a euphemism for what  she's yeah you know i get a lot of shit these days for uh posting too many pictures of my cat  i've turned into a cool cat i love that cat he's a solid he's fucking crazy he's getting he's getting  bigger he's definitely he's only like seven months old too wow what is it it's a bangle it's a bangle 
[02:45:30]  they look like little leopards have you ever seen videos of people feeding them chicken bones and  seem really growling and crazy crazy oh no no like cars and and transsexuals to little kittens to cute  kids guys with huge muscles and taps going that is adorable it's the cutest little thing people  people just tuned in oh it's the opening show it's great it's great listen to this and he's got fluffy 
[02:46:00]  little if anyone saw me around the house they'd think i'm like crazy cat no i love i just you get  they're fun so much fun to like rough house play around with and stuff and then they're just like  cool to have around it is a lovely cat i've been over there and it really is a friendly you can't  not love this cat yeah not afraid of anything and and just like like i have parties over my house  and you're just walking around it's so cool he's just used to it he's seen it already looks at 
[02:46:30]  everything like he's gonna pounce on your face anthony's cat is like one of the kids and once were  warriors it's not a very well-behaved cat because i'm very bad at disciplining i'd like a feisty cat  i love yes to be they used to be lions let them be like i love that i love the fact that they're  you can't really just you know they might bite you that's the thing yeah i'll be walking into  the kitchen and out of nowhere this thing will come flying out does like this upside down flip 
[02:47:00]  grab on your ankle close your head towards the refrigerator again that's the that's the cat's  version of going daddy don't drink anymore yeah the cat just can't take having its head stroke too  hard fox news on you agreeing out loud the cat's like i just want to laugh again  have fun he's fixed right i love this just in his pants 
[02:47:30]  loads of beers uh shit is you can't fix he's fixed right yeah yeah yeah yeah males you have to fix  yeah especially like that the thing would be pissing all over yes yeah don't need that  thing then i don't know i do that i've i've tried a lot of things that i've urinated on  it's mine four corners of a garden that is land ownership in cat law yeah i've got thousands of 
[02:48:00]  acres that way you gotta let these cats know once they start doing that too it's very hard to shake  them off though yeah yeah he's great though he like went right for the boxes and stuff like  that don't have to worry about it's a big enough house where he can run around and do things because  you can't really with a cat like that you can't really have a small place because he'd be climbing  in the walls but uh it also if i can just jumped off the balcony once onto the tile floor i guess  it had to learn but it's the second floor balcony right like and and just fell right down 
[02:48:30]  they hit their chin yeah with a screwy they can like drop a hundred feet yeah and they land  and the only thing that often is their chin carries on and they they have a little chin and  it got all mad and hissed at me and i'm like i didn't yeah the weird thing was on top of the  balcony the cat started yelling i love you damien this is for you that's a design though isn't it  to get whacked in the chin by spy but what's that they usually work that out the chin can't they just  roll like yeah you would think a commando roll or something or something yeah when they get older 
[02:49:00]  yeah i think they do yeah they got that leg thing where they straighten out and you know they land on  all fours but there's only so much shock you could absorb there yeah i saw a cat fall out of a tree in  a video and a really high tree and the cat like fell like 30 or 40 feet hit the ground bounced and  just ran took off yeah and they're fine it was nothing yeah it was strange animals yeah their  ability to absorb impact yeah yeah yeah the flexibility animal to domesticate themselves 
[02:49:30]  they did oh did they yeah my choice yeah they started coming into yeah just because i thought this  is cool some of that high speed their meows their their meow is is for um human contact only they  don't do that naturally they've learned the fact that they can get food by the meow is is something  they they developed for humans really to talk to us i have a cat that just talks to me she's 17 years  old wow and when i see her she's meow meow meow why like everybody's like what the fuck's wrong with your 
[02:50:00]  cat i'm like that's what she does it means food yeah every word is food always means they're mocking us  they're so tired of our babbling they're just trying to show us how awful we sound  that's what i hear all day while you're on the phone this is you stupid exactly this is you stupid  fucking awful i didn't know that was a but what about when they're in heat though 
[02:50:30]  yeah well they're howling it's a different yeah that's not a meow yeah it's a particular type of  meow they've developed that that they they've uh they found that we um are you making this up no it's  true where did you read this it's true um he read it on twitter yes my cat is really old i have two  cats one of them is really old and she um she doesn't know what's going on at night sometimes  so she howls in the middle of the night she just starts like i'll go to bed and she's like 
[02:51:00]  it's really strange and they well they say it's like an i have a sound machine i turn on  they say it's like an alzheimer's thing wow they get old and they don't know what the  fuck they don't know what's going on anymore she's 17. that's an old old  fucking cat that's really old for talking to mice she killed years ago oh what are you doing here mouse  she's a real sweet like fluffy cat like it's like half persian she's some sort of a mutt but uh you 
[02:51:30]  know i always think of it as this really sweet gentle cat and then one day i let her loose in the  courtyard and a bird she caught a bird slipping oh yeah swatted out of the sky bit it's next shook  her little head and just just ran into the house with it i was like that was like total instinct  yeah she never killed anything she was like well cool to see those how good is that thing when they  they can see a pigeon at the window they can't get to it so they they act out they they salivate they 
[02:52:00]  act out the kill i love that i absolutely love that i can't get in a bit i go ollie look it's a  pigeon she goes it's like a person being in one of those 42nd street booths looking at the girl  cats don't share our love for animals no they don't share our love for their vicious murderers  i i've watched my cat look out the window too and and just fixate on something and i'm just like 
[02:52:30]  i don't see it i don't see anything and then there'll be this little little thing under a leaf  and you're like god damn that cat's got great eyes i'm not saying maybe you know maybe the  beers didn't help yeah exactly i'm maybe i'm seeing a little blurry yeah and the cat is just fixed on it  on the weird thing in the rearview mirror and it looks like flashing lights  yeah but it is an odd uh i i don't like people who hate cats like some people just don't dog people 
[02:53:00]  but i like i've had cats grow up i love it yeah i can't i can't think anyone who's got any strong  feelings about hating a pet i hate rabbits really yeah i hate them i don't want to go into it but  yeah i hate rabbits my grandmother had a monkey that was a cunt it was a crazy animal it was an  evil animal i don't even think that's legal that's a hell of a soundbite isn't it it sounds like some  sort of weird euphemism but i can't wow how does she have a monkey she had a monkey she lived in new 
[02:53:30]  jersey this is like uh that's where they're they have monkeys in the congo the wilds of new jersey wow  yeah grandma's monkey sounds like a euphemism don't don't touch grandma's monkey  he used to chew gum he used to give it gum it would unwrap the gum and chew it my grandmother was the  only one who could touch it it would bite everybody else no shit it would bite you they're mean little  things you'd reach over to touch it it would grab you hold on your hand and bite you but where did 
[02:54:00]  she get a monkey from yeah she bought it from somebody i guess i mean some black market or maybe the  regular the regulations were different the 70s yeah maybe she had a free loving monkeys sure  it's great yeah fucking creepy monkey peace loving monkeys only loved my grandmother didn't like  anybody else everybody else can go themselves damn how big did it get it's a little thing with a little  spider monkey looking thing or long tail i remember i don't it had a tail i was little i don't like  that outbreak monkey very similar outbreak monkeys i don't remember too much i just remember chi chi 
[02:54:30]  that was its name creepy fucking monkey named chi chi there are people that had those uh like chimpanzees  that are just fucking that's like having an insane fighter in your house way worse than that some of  the other people that can rip your face off and rip your arm off yeah yeah yeah it's chewbacca  there's no more yeah yeah well that lady in connecticut was just a few years ago what a great story  i had to alter the the laws she had to have a face transplant wild animals right when they someone 
[02:55:00]  someone climbs into a polar bear pit of the zoo and they get killed and they go it's terrible should  the bear be put down no it shouldn't be put down it shouldn't be in there and people shouldn't  climb in to see a polar bear it did absolutely what it was supposed to do exactly yeah that's  his job fucking eating things that's his job people to climb in with an alligator and lose  their leg yeah yeah that was supposed to happen yeah is there anything funny when you see footage  of someone by a lion cage in the zoo and they've turned around for a photo and the lion gets a hold  of that members only jacket and they're just pinned feeling like silly geese as everybody tries to pull 
[02:55:30]  them off the power behind those things yeah and it's so deceiving because they can look so graceful  when they're running and even walking you see a lion walk their their feet kind of slowly  power and speed they have when they want to rip your your throat out and and i'm all for it oh yeah if  you if you torture a wild animal and there's there's nothing greater than the justified violence of a  bull putting its horn through some fucking twat in a fucking tight trousers okay do you know what i mean 
[02:56:00]  well that one iconic image of the horn coming out of his mouth oh that one where it goes under his jaw  out of his mouth yeah oh it's one right up his ass yeah oh is that a good one yeah that's great  it's it's it's not great because the ball still dies and was tortured right you know what they even cut  the tendons and they're in their neck so it's in charge mode it doesn't have that yeah ability to 
[02:56:30]  flip them anymore they fucking wind it up they cut the tendons so it's always in charge it can't do  anything but put its head down it's but it's torture it is it's weird you're watching animal  torture yeah yeah it's not a piggish culture to do that yeah watch it on bourdain's show and it was  interesting like he was trying to like he was trying to be cool about it yeah i was trying to be cool  about it and they were trying to explain it that this is a part of their tradition this rich  culture i'm like yeah yeah yeah yeah i don't think so well it's not a fair fight either there's  a bunch of other dudes sticking spears in the thing yeah yeah go out there go out there yeah 
[02:57:00]  bare hands go ahead duke it out with them you didn't wear horns yeah i'll even let you wear horns  little viking helmet little viking helmet yeah yeah you think it wouldn't be much of a match  i'm opposed to zoos as well i mean i i i'm a hypocrite because i take my kids to the zoo because i  just want them to see these animals yeah i can't change the fact that it exists but the idea of  this animal prison is really kind of yeah it is it depends there's a lot a lot of them to do 
[02:57:30]  do do animal husbandry but when it when it gets to when it gets to a you know a tiger walking the  same 40 yards in his footprints and he's the and you know he's he's the experiment he's the one to keep  the species going i i i do feel for that guy i feel for that one guy who's who didn't choose to  be this guinea pig to keep this yeah you know the species i i do worry about that individual  animal because i i i do even more so of sea world sea world's oh that's disgusting find out 
[02:58:00]  that documentary was amazing yeah that was fantastic yeah it's it's it's literally the  deception that's going on it's like having an alien that you can't understand so you're like  i don't know what you're saying get in the get in the cage do you want to eat yeah well you know  how to flip so you got to do that you know what's so fascinating about that is they they show you they  tell you in the documentary in blackfish that that those orcas in captivity are the only ones who 
[02:58:30]  their their dorsal fin leans over yeah there's no such thing as that happening in the wild no no  so like it's it's basically giving you this signal that effect yeah you can actually see them whale  depression it's whale depression it's whale depression and they also tell you how you can  actually see so much cooler if you go on a instead of going to right when you want to just see them  in in their natural habitat and and realize that they're the ocean is their home there's no way you  can make a tank big enough that's going to accommodate what these animals are used to and 
[02:59:00]  what they need but i always think i always think whatever you're into there is an ethical alternative  and if there isn't it just don't do it i mean right right right no doubt you know you can you can go  clay pigeon shooting you can do you know you can do you know uh you don't need to see something die in  agony fun there's you know you can you can shoot targets you're not a fan of hunting man yeah well  no thing is it's a matter of degrees for me there's a difference between someone who goes out sport 
[02:59:30]  hunting of foods food for his family just like animals do and you know and let's face it so you  know an animal that's lived a great life and is a clean kill and you you you you eat every part of  it if you're a meat eater is better than some of the food industry whereas chicken's been literally  tortured all its life so you can buy a chicken for two dollars so you know it is a matter of degrees  but it's the trophy hunting i don't why killing a dangerous species why the can hunting is disgusting  they've just been bred and it's so easy it's not much not clever of course you're going to win you've 
[03:00:00]  got a fucking gun right there's no i know the result you win you've got a fucking gun right but it's  the macho what is the what turns you on about killing a thing for the sake of it you're not going to  eat that woman that shot that lion and she was there with the lion as the trophy it's like  nah that it's not just one of them i mean the the lion thing is fascinating because they're they're  they're all in these high fence operations as well and these people go over there and they pay money  and right what's weird is here's what gets really strange is like that's where a lot of the 
[03:00:30]  conservation conservation funding comes from from hunting shooting the animals so a rich twat can  but yeah like the rhino for 50 grand or a black rhino thing but the why can't you give the money  and not shoot it if you've got 50 grand to spend on a bullet going through and on his head yeah let's  give the money and not well the issue with that rhino a person yeah is that they needed to take out  that rhino was an aggressive male that was no longer breeding and was killing was in had the potential 
[03:01:00]  for killing younger rhinos we were talking about that it's like well so what that's what he does but the  other thing is if something needs to be done yeah why does it have to make it into a sport and fun  when i i have to get have my cat put down if the vet said do you mind if i masturbate i'd say yeah i do  why getting fun out of something that's necessary do you know what i mean  why do you have to get a fucking weird if it has to be done it has to be done but you don't have to 
[03:01:30]  go around bragging about it and make a game out of it you don't do that when you know they turn the  machine off you know what i mean she'll turn the machine off is it going to be on or off okay let's  bet now uh but why make a game out of it yeah yeah yeah yeah the idea is that this money that they  spent this 350 000 is going to go towards helping the ones that are going to stay alive preserving them  and allowing them to spend money and allow them to maintain their habitat but the real quandary is 
[03:02:00]  that their habitat is all fenced in it's a really weird thing because it's kind of like hunting in  a zoo right because you're pretending that they're wild animals but there's a fence around the whole  operation so it's it's very strange like they guarantee these animals are in there they're not  fucking going anywhere yeah right and they're saying well this is you know this this all this money goes  to the renewable resource the conservation of these animals and there's more animals today because of the  hunters efforts but man when you see the way they hunt these animals like these lions are just 
[03:02:30]  sitting there i watched this one show where these lions are sleeping and this guy sneaks up on them  and shoots them with a bow and arrow i mean while they're sleeping battering i don't know where the  the other thing about it is you don't even eat lions no no let's put this in context imagine someone saying  um there's a guy um he's gonna give a million dollars to cancer research all he wants is to shoot one  constipation just choose just choose one that's definitely one that's an asshole he just wants 
[03:03:00]  to shoot in the head we're ready to give a million and we'll probably cure right sir yeah what do you  think i'll i'll i'll i'll talk to mrs brown if he gives two million he can shoot a kid right yeah  exactly you know what i mean there you go just set them loose yeah i've seen i think the craziest thing with  the hunting people hunt um i i know a guy who showed me he hunts at a feed and i thought that  was the most bizarre thing wow that like he goes we have a tree stand so that's yeah yeah so and they 
[03:03:30]  know when the feed comes out and i'm like so what do you do like when you sit here and you just shoot  it when it's eating i'm like that's great well see like that's uh is that the cure for obesity you  know is it better than farming i mean the idea of farming is you have all these animals they're penned  and eventually you're going to kill them and eat them well if you do it ethically and humanely most  people aren't too opposed to right the idea is factory farm is what we have a real issue with  but if you were going to farm deer like that just have like a feeder and yeah every now and then just  snipe one from a distance again everything being equal where is the fun in these people that call 
[03:04:00]  it i don't think it's fun yeah that's not what it's it's not it it you know i don't know they're  they're they're their excitement must literally be that i put the bullet in its head that that must  be that's the only thing you can reduce yeah there's not even a hunt that's going on where  they're stalking or there's some strategy to it if they're laying down and the guy kills a lion that's  laying down sleeping there's no and you don't need to and right right here and you know you know it's 
[03:04:30]  it's it's yeah yeah it's reduced to purely for the fun of saying i'm killing something you know  what would be a great thing if a lion is sleeping if you walk up and you slap it on the balls and  then run away that's something you should feel really good about if you get away with that  now i'd allow that as a sport yeah of course because i know the lion would win nine times  the tenth time he'd be going did that cocksucker just slide yeah yeah or there'd be one there'd be 
[03:05:00]  one jim norton lion who'd go do it again yeah yeah you realize it was just a lioness with the balls  yes we get it yeah yeah yeah say the boys yeah there's a great video i saw the other day i guess  they were helping out this leopard who's causing some problems uh in some village and they decided  to relocate it so they put him in a cage they drive him out however many miles and um it's a couple of  african guys in in the cab of this truck this pickup truck with the cage in the back and the leopard 
[03:05:30]  they open the door it wouldn't get out of the cage so the guy opens the door of the cab of the  pickup by the steering wheel he's hanging onto the steering wheel and he's kind of poking the cage  to get the leopard out the leopard comes out turns right the around and charges at him he shuts the  door but he left the window open this fucking leopard jumps in the window and just starts clawing  at the sky it was like when newman got killed in jurassic park it looked like that the truck is 
[03:06:00]  shaking he's just screaming and it's all on video it's great and i'm just laughing like the leopard's  getting you didn't you hate that scene in jurassic park where he gets in the truck and the thing  was lurking in the back like a rapist it's like a prehistoric animal but it understands hanging out  in the back seat he does this before work i'll hide under the paper what happened a dinosaur  yeah our relationship to animals is a very strange one it's pretty shitty actually very strange 
[03:06:30]  yeah it's very well it's because it's because we we we like animals we love them as as pets certain  ones and stuff but we also have this thing where we need to eat them i think that we think we're not  animals i think that's right yes we're not animals and obviously we are um uh and we think that it's  all for us we were put here on this earth it's all for us right that's that's that's the common attitude  yeah well there you go isn't it i mean isn't the bible comes from it's all been put here for our 
[03:07:00]  take your car for our enjoyment do what we want all the game there's the big shark carl a moment in  in australia right they're starting to kill a bunch of sharks and they're saying you know the the  the people that are you know for it are saying but you know it's dangerous if you go into this  particular bit of sea don't go into that position problem solved yeah when the sharks are getting  out and getting you an internet cafe well what they need to do is make some sort of  fucking bulletproof surf suit there you go you know make some surf suit where you could get bit 
[03:07:30]  and it's just a freak out ah he fucking bit me and did you see that cool nothing yeah that'd be  pretty cool some really super light chain mail yeah every time i stick my dick in this meat mincer it  choose up don't don't don't don't do that yes meat mincer is not actually her name but  we really have not figured out that shark thing like there's really no good defense against a shark 
[03:08:00]  if you're in the water with them it they really win they just win you do and they break apart those  shark cages sometimes a big one a big one would get in there and start hammering it they're not  meant to withstand the impact they're amazing they're amazing animals yeah they're the cleanup crew  just like mountain lions are the cleanup crew just like lions are the cleanup crew they're i mean nature  has a full system they have a fire about of teeth it's just the new ones that they just keep coming 
[03:08:30]  yes that tells you right there all right you know what his job is if he has to replace his own  fucking team with a shark you can't get me footing either that's another thing that sucks you're  really no it's like you got no leverage to kind of work against the shark yeah all you can do is  swing your nose yeah hear that meanwhile every action equal and opposite reaction you go to hit  against the nose your body goes back so you really got nothing so you're getting half of a watery punch 
[03:09:00]  i don't think the shark gives a shit yeah no that people have survived they survived like in a foot of  water right dragged away without their feet yeah yeah out in open water it's very little you're just  nothing you can do the shark bites you and realizes you're not what you you basically have to rely on  the shark not enjoying your taste right if he bites you and says this is not what i want and and lets you  go that's the only at least it's fast and there's not a lot of terror and agony during the whole thing  i think you're sealed they always think you're seals don't they they don't yes oh do they love a 
[03:09:30]  seal say they don't apologize no i thought you're a seal i'm i'm in half it's pretty amazing yeah yeah  go in the water at all imagine going to a restaurant they serve you a nice filet mignon you go to cut it  into it and it goes hey i'm not a filet mignon exactly like oh yeah it's not my fault i bet you want  a shark to me a shark radio show right now they're talking about cruelty to people and you know sometimes  they just bite one and they don't need to bite them they know what he is i do eat all the human  if it's uh i don't do it for fun i sometimes do it for fun uh i do eat all the human yeah well look 
[03:10:00]  at harry he's got a he's got a surfboard collection it is fascinating our ethical relationship with  animals yes that we do decide like what's the good way to kill them right the least amount of cruelty and  which ones will leave factory farming and all these and when did that come about was it always like like  in our primitive stage did we care how we killed an animal i think we probably used i mean that was  the thing about the native americans they used all of the animal and then they showed respect to the 
[03:10:30]  animal because in that way this symbiotic relationship with these animals they need the animals to stay  alive and all they hunted them they still they had reverence and respect for them and then you know  do buffalo dances and you know do all these different things with that was a very spiritual thing  more than it was like um caring about the animals feelings well i think it made sense evolutionary  speaking because they knew that it was like um not over farming and over hunting right they knew what 
[03:11:00]  to do to have a crop next year whereas um then you guys came along and just killed every buffalo and  you couldn't even technically it was you guys yeah yeah yeah it is an evolutionary thing but then we get 
[03:11:30]  to the point where you you have so many people to feed you can't be coddling every chicken uh and making  sure he's got a lot of room it just it doesn't work out mathematically but we've always been the humans  have always been like locusts they they they just they ravaged they don't you know they don't worry about  it even even early um sort of uh uh what would be called cavemen um 10 15 000 years ago they discovered  they could run mammoths over the edge of a cliff oh god and they they they killed 25 but they 
[03:12:00]  couldn't eat it's hard to kill a mammoth yeah yeah yeah figure out what you're gonna do you don't have  a gun you don't have a car you don't even have heat what are you gonna do run these cunts right off a  fucking door when your kids are screaming your eyes are bigger than your belly you're not gonna eat all that  i have this big hairy elephant thing yeah yeah i don't even know what an elephant is yet 
[03:12:30]  it's gonna have a brazilian it's gonna be an elephant that had to be the first time anyone  ever went you know the other cave comes over and goes you're gonna eat that yeah yeah you're gonna  finish that well a mammoth deserves to be killed because it looks so pedable big long hair you're  like oh that's got to be a delight you walk over yeah yeah giant yeah fucking big thing with a wig  i love when a circus elephant tramples everybody that's the nothing makes me happier oh it's lovely  isn't it the circus elephant always has been caged and it's being whipped and it just suddenly turns 
[03:13:00]  around but it's not okay to come with this form of entertainment right the circus what a what a dark  ages fucking form of entertainment the circus is yeah let's let's let's let's make ethical snuff movies  where the person dies but deserved it because he was torturing an animal right there you go it's  great isn't it yeah when when those elephants lose their mind though and then you realize like wow that  has been a patient elephant because he could have done that any time and what the rage they can let  loose the elephant was waiting because just when you think it's okay it they you know yeah bartini 
[03:13:30]  gets killed carlo gets strangled i've watched it 50 times i know all of my heart and it's still a joy  to watch it's it's amazing the god it's incredible isn't it and brando was a cat lover in the beginning  how great was that yeah yeah flossing with the cat and meowing yeah do you ever see you ever see weird  justice you see footage of uh godfather outtakes where they'll show like uh all these like cue cards 
[03:14:00]  because brando was such a wacko like he didn't know his lines and like you realize this genius  performance when he was looking over james khan's head reading lines i've heard stories but i never you  know that they're true but i did hear one when he got a bit bigger that he'd do takes with his trousers  down so they couldn't they had to use the close-up yes in the uh in the de niro movie with ed in the  in the in the score oh is that what it was yes i heard that because he was so obese uh and james  khan was in here and he said that brando would actually have time to put his lines on people's 
[03:14:30]  heads yeah how demeaning how demeaning is that hey i've got a part with brando why he wants to write  on me yeah right on me yeah i wasn't even in it i was just a keyboard board yes the worst like the  worst hairline you had the more brando loves you 
[03:15:00]  james khan yeah he really did oh boy he threw him under the bus when he was in here that was  part of brando's genius james khan he said all that that he had all his lines written all over  the set he's dead though it's true though what's wrong with that yeah was it bad that he's still  brilliant performance still a great performance i couldn't tell bad that he read it it's even more  impressive that he did that to make that alive and still looking at it is more impressive than  anything well you know maybe he did actually know the lines but he wanted to be really clear 
[03:15:30]  and have no thinking whatsoever about what comes next so have it all spelled out  on the little kid's head though yeah how do you spell that yeah how do you spell that stand still you  little bastard he was a strange in his later days huh oh he was an odd guy crazy  asshole yeah remember when he had the native american go up to accept him yeah yeah she wasn't  even real she wasn't even a real native american girl yeah actress they fucking boot her that's great 
[03:16:00]  and then on larry king interviews were great he was just leaning over kissing larry king  and they would just talk about the oddest things but i think sometimes i have to see people like that  right and i think they must think oh i'm marlon brando i've had all this right everyone thinks i'm great  uh-huh i've surrounded by yes man i just want to fuck things up a little bit i want to see what  happened let me see what i could get away what can i get away with before people go no we're not  accepting exactly yeah yeah i don't care who you are you're being an asshole yeah exactly who's going to 
[03:16:30]  say it right right who's going to be the one go look at on the waterfront how beautiful he was  and then look what he ate himself into i mean he ate himself into ralphie may proportions yeah he's just  fucking enormous human being towards the end of his life yeah but when he was young it was this  this beautiful sculpted man right perfect features there are people that um died early that uh you  know could have reached that point that it's like all right good like i think i think um what's his name  of everyone jim morrison would have been a big bad guy now yeah everyone who died young and is revered 
[03:17:00]  would be hated now right through something they do they do loads of terrible things yeah exactly yeah  jim morrison would be tweeting about those negroes yeah jim morrison had a he had to apologize today for  yeah marty monroe i'd do the panda today just for fun yeah yeah fuck it fuck the little black and white  cunt i'm wearing panda skin panties exactly extra large yeah we revere them now but they would have 
[03:17:30]  just been assholes the other way around as well because they're on twitter that you would get geniuses  if isaac newton was around today and he was on twitter they'd be going they'd be saying things like  i'm glad the apple finally had your faggot why wouldn't you have worked you know there's no  respect either either way oh einstein having to print you haters yeah would just be 
[03:18:00]  so demeaning people off i had a great speech then someone sent me this tweet and it  me up i didn't know what to say well they would go after einstein for his love of too oh well  oh was he a hound yeah einstein was a weird character he he was eccentric in more ways than one so was  fine men sort of a lot of brilliant guys yeah the chasers that would know that that would be the  big deal kept that uh kept under wraps yeah big time you know how good you have to be getting a  his cousin or something like that huh didn't einstein marry his cousin first time hearing this i never  heard that yeah jerry louis it's not libelous jerry jerry lee einstein he's the one that married his cousin 
[03:18:30]  yeah i'm not i'm not sure about that that must have looked great when he was going down on a girl  though with that head of hair yeah einstein married his cousin take that picture wow he married his  second cousin elsa oh second 19 19. now now what second is that second cousin your cousin's offspring 
[03:19:00]  or is that your cousin's cousin i think it's your cousin's cousin i don't know i like the fact her  name was elsa i think we're all missing that how names have really evolved nicely elsa that's a  terrible name you don't like that no i couldn't come to it that's not a pretty name how would that get in  the way her shout in her own name how would that stop saying your name i would just i would just  look at her and know it would just just know whenever i have sex with a girl i have to fuck 
[03:19:30]  her with her own license on her forehead it's a weird fetish okay listen to this she was his  first cousin maternally and his second cousin paternal all right so there was shenanigans going  out beforehand i gotta work this out yeah yeah what the fuck does that hold on hold on does that  mean mother's sister's daughter his aunt so it's it's it's his aunt's daughter on the mother's side  it was his mother's sister's daughter mother's daughter gotcha that's your first and once removed 
[03:20:00]  paternally now the father had to have been his his this is like one of those conundrums isn't it it's  great okay yeah cousin's brother what welcome to who did einstein fuck so so the girl that he married  the girl that he married her parents were somehow related yeah the mother and father get your parents  were related well i mean besides just marriage i think they were like uh related oh i see what 
[03:20:30]  you mean they were cousins wow this is crazy yeah i please apply i safe to say not a soft dick in this  room right now wow that's uh yeah this is that's a trip back then i think it was more accepted they have  kids like charlie rose this show they have kids none of this came up with charlie rose there's not 
[03:21:00]  one bit of crossover on a venn diagram these circles are miles apart there's literally no crossover there's  no uh little area there's no uh i want to know they had kids yes they did do they have smart kids  that's a good question that's a good question yes they did they're confused they're not smart kids  we would have known they're all yeah they're not smart enough yeah they're not smart enough 
[03:21:30]  because it's a conjoined head giant brain with wild hair  that's the expectations of being einstein oh yeah that's got it what did you do yeah how'd you do i've  got an a yeah i plus uh 97 huh you suck jesus yeah and then that that's ironic the theory of  relativity and there's related to the people that it's a little irony it's almost cruel yeah you go we 
[03:22:00]  see what i've done on you go on you go really bad theory of relativity yeah einstein's theory of  relativity is fuck your cousin that's why i'm not kidding because they could never ever compete with  me oh i don't want to be yeah would you just be rubbing it in your children's faces look what i did  yeah they would they they wouldn't have to do doing much to beat me anything really a lot of people 
[03:22:30]  have kids and they want to spare their kids that they had to go through to get to achieve like they  want it to be softer like i just don't have them yeah that's done there you go believe me i've wasted  generations alone easy easy enough yeah there's a lineage in my sock hamper literally a planet full oh yeah  wow yeah a planet full of people there i think you don't have any sperm cells or any of these load  it's crazy i mean you can fertilize a continent with one shot one shot imagine loads of jim norton's if 
[03:23:00]  you just like yeah we would lose our i think this one one or two is okay but a whole bunch of them  we just kind of get this we gotta start cloning you jimmy we gotta just start cloning you yeah fix all  the flaws like give it a chin and no erection difficulties that's great make it sound like  some sort of one generation amphibian it's like it came into the gene pool for one generation it 
[03:23:30]  didn't work out it fell out of the gene pool what was that picture you tweeted of you when i said it  looks like the one from the science the lambs you dancing around with your shirt off with lipstick on  it was a lipstick picture of me that was my twitter photo that was from leno right i did leno and i 
[03:24:00]  took the wig off in the car oh it was so creepy oh maybe it was that i had a leopard dress i just  thought you were at home alone just taking pictures but i'll just tweet that oh yeah no no the way  would have still that on this photo is that a photo of you taking a picture with a fucking cheetah next  to you what is that no no i tweeted that oh yeah real man shoot animals what what is this guy doing 
[03:24:30]  he's got a is that a cheetah or a leopard right next to him i think it's a preservation because the  cheetah's got a little thing on so i think he's probably a not a tame domesticated somehow or another  it's probably about 10 000 acres and but he's a famous photographer so i think he probably gets  in with them and that's right it was that the other one was the the big thing was that melissa  was it mr barkman who yes yeah i think so oh the the chick who shoots the lions she shoots the lions  yeah and she tweeted what a hunt and i said spot the typo that's great that's so english 
[03:25:00]  that's such british humor yeah that's hilarious very well done bravo yeah that was very well handled  i i eat meat and i hunt i just started hunting recently because i don't want to be a part of  factory farming i don't i don't believe in it i think it's disgusting and i want to avoid it  as much as possible but the idea of shooting things just to shoot them and trophies that's  ridiculous it's this it's not it's disgusting it's disgusting it's weird there's no reason for 
[03:25:30]  it kills these for fun apart from the car they love it yeah look what there are there are certain  issues like wolves they're there they have to call the wolf population in north america because they  brought wolves in they brought wolves in from canada because wolves had declined radically because of  hunting now they've taken off and they've become a huge threat to livestock they've decimated the elk  and deer population and they're way above what they think is a healthy number of wolves and like idaho  and a lot of the western states so they started hunts on wolves and a lot of people are complaining 
[03:26:00]  like people that don't live in these areas but people don't remember that the big bad wolf and all that  shit that all came from wolves eating people in paris in 14 in the 1400s wolves killed 40 people in  paris wow in paris they came into paris and started killing people because they're smart  and they figured out how to gang up on people get a good group of them together and let's let's find  some of these the french are easy though they gave up very quickly against a few nazis they didn't want to 
[03:26:30]  drop their croissant first the wolves now the nazis picture of wolves walking down the street with a guy  crying yeah like i have a real issue with hunting for sport but the people that think that you're  not supposed to control populations of predators are crazy it's a marriage exactly yeah it is very  different and you're right you're right something that you could shoot a pheasant and eat every part  of it that feeds a family if if you eat meat then that is better as i said then have you seen the 
[03:27:00]  chickens they keep they yeah they pump them up so they they reach adult in a few days in complete  darkness they they they become cannibals it sends them crazy just so you can have a two pound chicken  so you can cut their beaks off to keep them from pecking each other it's the it's oh that's nice  jesus chickens cannibalize each other normally though i have chickens i have chickens i've  four 14 of them in my backyard i have a giant chicken coop and 14 chickens yeah we get eggs from 
[03:27:30]  them every day it's great they're you know but they're free range they're friendly very friendly  they're like pets you know my wife picks them you can't fuck them i would love to i'm trying to  learn german there's one there's one that you thought but uh they uh they they have issues they  they'll they'll attack each other they're they're pecking order that that phrase comes from right yeah  they're really mean to this well i have one chicken that's like a really tiny one and they  this chicken up man they're gang up on her chicken bullying yeah they're all girls so they all like 
[03:28:00]  you know they henpeck each other that's all the words but they will now they make sense they will  they will find a hole they'll they'll peck at each other and then create a hole and then once they  create a hole like you have to do something about it because otherwise they'll just keep going at it  yeah they'll kill it oh man they'll cannibalize it need it yeah they're ruthless as far as like eating  meat i'll give them like leftover scraps like chicken i won't give them chicken but i mean yeah that's a  little piece of food i'll give them uh beef you know whatever leftover beef or whatever and they'll 
[03:28:30]  they'll go crazy they'll eat that they eat venison they'll go bananas for it so now they've got a  taste for cow yeah so the farmer next door i caught him up a mouse really they  up a mouse the other day yeah they they cornered it and they have a this huge chicken coop it's like  like a house sized and they i'll open the door and i let them run around the yard it sounds like  shawshank it's amazing oh they found a mouse a mouse made its way into the coop but how did they 
[03:29:00]  catch it they just went after it they're fast they're really fast they can run well i trained  my boxing like that in philadelphia years ago my trainer told me if once i catch a chicken i can  catch grease lightning yeah yeah rocky too and that's from a broken down punk like me yeah  who knew i was jewish until they buried me in the third one  i would be scared if uh chicken ate the mouse there that they might pick up some kind of oh 
[03:29:30]  could be an issue bubonic plague or something it could be an issue yeah usually the eggs are pretty  protected dietarily from what they eat is not you know like protected for parasites and things like  that but yeah you have to be careful you have to be careful no yeah how many eggs a week you get  from that a lot i get about nine a day nine a day every day yeah one chicken's turned up  missing chicken um it's either a dog one of my dogs got it which i don't think happened because 
[03:30:00]  the dogs are pretty friendly and they don't exhibit that or a hawk much more more likely a hawk got it  i'm motivated because there's no feathers there's no nothing around so pretty sure i can took them  up into the sky well the area where they they free range is a lot of trees so it's difficult for  a hawk to get in there but sometimes they wander outside of that area and go out by the pool i think  that's what happened coyotes a lot of coyotes especially in uh where i live i live about 30 miles  north of la we have deer in my yard yeah i see deer in my yard every day wow yeah it's very very 
[03:30:30]  rural it's crazy wild a lot of acreage up there but there's a lot of hawks any mountain lions yes  two in my neighborhood i spotted yeah it's not cool jeez they love bicyclists well they love anything  that's running yeah they'll chase it down and just they can't help it it's a ball of yarn yeah they  love it ball of yarn well samuel jackson tweeted a picture uh recently of uh mulholland drive of a  mountain lion on sunday afternoon killing a deer on mulholland drive it looked huge that 
[03:31:00]  that's amazing bigger than it looked like a real lion it was huge big cats man they get to be a  buck 50. i've seen two of them i've seen uh one in colorado and one in santa barbara  they're smaller cats they're both about like 70 60 70 pounds that's what i thought they were i thought  they were like they're pumas aren't they they're basically yeah yeah the biggest ones get to be about  a buck 50. i mean they can get to 200 pounds yeah yeah yeah it had this deer it was mounting on  this deer and it's biting its neck so it's pretty fucked and right on mulholland that happens all 
[03:31:30]  the time powerful those you see the photos of the one that they found uh that lives in um uh that  park right above the hollywood sign like uh right above la big cat they got all these camera trap  photos of this giant cat that lives right up there right in this park where everybody jogs  it's a giant predator amazing yeah just hanging out waiting killing deers kind of like whatever  it gets a hold of i hate tourists they're so slow and stupid they always stop right there 
[03:32:00]  they look at this little thing in their hand and they ignore their surroundings  it's amazing it's so easy you see kiosk running down the street in l.a all the time with dogs in  their mouths just you've seen it on fountain in hollywood in the it like midnight just jogging  down the street with a dog in its mouth and i've seen i've had them uh like late at night heard this 
[03:32:30]  crazy like it sounds like a bark but it's so much higher pitched and i saw that a pack of them had  come out uh because they'll you know there's a little dogs away don't they they what they lure dogs  away they lure dogs away one blows away the dog goes to plays with it and then the pack yeah yeah  yeah it's crazy they cut out in packs and like you at first you're like what is that shrieking  high-pitched because it it doesn't sound like a like a familiar dog bark and stuff and i went out  and and they were they had gathered around uh there was a like a big dog that was through a screen gate 
[03:33:00]  and they had found this apartment and they were just like six of them yeah working like a team yeah the dog  would win against one but they they take it away yeah one lures it away and the rest yeah then they  get it yeah because if they get dogs that could kill them you know a big dog would kill it right  but not not six or seven exactly yeah it's like a young officer and a gentleman you remember when  he went over there and uh he was playing with the filipino kid and they took him outside almost said hey  big spender give us your money that's right it's exactly like that 
[03:33:30]  there's a guy who uh works at the pet store near me that also works for veterinarians office and they  brought in this big pit bull 120 pound pitfall had cuts all over its body the owner had no idea  what happened and somehow another got out of the yard and something attacked it they went back to the  yard they stitched this thing up a thousand stitches all over the dog's body go back to the yard follow  the trail of blood from the dog's house to up into the woods where they find nine dead coyotes wow 
[03:34:00]  this pit bull got lured into this trap and just fucked them all up he said it looked like saving  private ryan just guts and he was torn apart and you know pit bulls are very extraordinary dogs it's  very difficult yeah the biting power is ridiculous isn't it 120 pound pitbull is a fucking lion i mean that's  an enormous dog yeah it's just they up they lured the wrong one in man i went them all i went walking  with wolves um a while ago for my birthday um and uh and before we met them they were saying things don't 
[03:34:30]  don't have shoelaces undone don't um always have a fist right don't put your hand out don't have a fake  fern like that right uh don't eat just before don't eat anything real wolves or real wolves yeah  yeah yeah pets no ah wild wild okay they're keeping this big thing in in reading right they're socialized  so they have an owner all right but they're they they have their instincts they breed them they're  wolves in the wild but in an area okay uh but you can meet them okay and so i've heard all this 
[03:35:00]  they're fighting power is five times a pit bull they're buying powers telling me he said that he  had a the guy who fed them this this that doesn't seem right it's it's crazy and um we went out there  no they're big and so he comes out this big this the the alpha male it's called turak and i've heard  all this stuff and he came up to me and i was standing there he put his paws on my shoulder and  started licking my face and i was going oh god what'd i do and they're going he likes he likes he likes the 
[03:35:30]  beard he likes the beard i was going oh god oh god oh god and he just cut down right and then  we had to approach them and they they went in first right and uh they like having their uh  underbelly yeah don't he said don't touch their back don't said stretch their underbelly it's  because you're submissive then that means you're underneath them so many rules yeah see i would have  thought that made them submissive by showing you their belly no no if you because you're underneath  they're feeling on their belly so they've won okay so they're feeling about and then they 
[03:36:00]  then the two females came out there was an alpha female in in his tribe one and she just kept  fucking screwing up this other um uh female just i was like oh my god it's okay it's normal they bite  to their potential um which means that they'll bite just to win and they won't buy anymore they won't  draw blood it's just it's just a game and it's that when we when when they're puppies we let them bite us 
[03:36:30]  but we scream before it hurts so i think that's their thing so then when they bite us they think  they've won but it's not hurting you wow it's it's amazing he said we're going to go past a different  pack now don't stand between the two because they'll bite you it's called transferred aggression all right  so we have to stand there's like and they went at each other these were on chains and the other one  and they were i've never seen anything like it it was like something from a horror film  and these big chains but they're sort of like they're not tame but they're socialized they can 
[03:37:00]  control them see i would never want to go walking with any animal where they're like okay look make  sure you keep your fingers into a fist yeah yeah that is a scary proposition i was nervous all the  time because i think things can go wrong they could suddenly get the hell and then all of a sudden  you're just laying there going oh no but i'm ricky gervais don't let my throat out here's the bite  stats a wolf can uh bite at 1500 pounds of pressure per square inch which is strong enough to snap an  elk's leg in half a domestic dog or even an american pit bull uh gets to about 250 to 300 pounds of 
[03:37:30]  pressure per square inch wow not even five times wow isn't that amazing right five times that sounds  so crazy he told me he he was chopping up um uh a cow okay for to feed them and he couldn't he  couldn't get through the hip and he just threw it in he said and turak came along and bid it in oh  oh shit unbelievable that's some lesson it's like the jaws of life the fire department uses 
[03:38:00]  this bike through a fucking roof of a car but i never knew they were that big either i never knew  they are big yes they're huge he literally he's he was taller than me he was taller than me when he  stood on me and he was just licking </pre>
