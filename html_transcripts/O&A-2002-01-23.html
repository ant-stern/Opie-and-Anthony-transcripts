<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a raucous promotion for "Whip'em Out Wednesday," encouraging listeners to display "WOW" signs in their cars.  This transitioned into a discussion of Mike Tyson's erratic behavior, fueled by repeated playbacks of audio clips featuring Tyson's highly offensive and violent outbursts. Callers phoned in with exaggerated accounts of Tyson's supposed Manhattan rampage.  The hosts, interspersed with their own profane commentary and sexually explicit jokes, also discussed the "Naughty Nighty" contest, a listener-participation segment showcasing submitted photos of women.  Colin Quinn joined the show in studio, offering commentary on both Tyson's antics and the "Naughty Nighty" contest.

The show then delved into a farcical *Weekly World News* story claiming Abraham Lincoln was a woman, presenting supposed photographic and biographical "evidence."  This was followed by a segment featuring listener-submitted "F.U." messages.  The hosts, along with Quinn, mocked an upcoming 80s-themed TV show, which led to a nostalgic, often offensive, discussion about 1980s pop culture and significant events, including the assassination attempts on Reagan and Lennon, the Challenger disaster, and Rock Hudson's death.  A caller, Andy, complained about a negative interaction with Colin Quinn, sparking a heated exchange.

A significant portion focused on Opie and Anthony's visit to "Stalker Patty's" home, describing the unsettling environment and inhabitants in graphic and derogatory terms, including the mention of a Down syndrome child.  They discussed the potential dangers of the situation and revealed details about Stalker Patty's background and the possibly federally funded nature of her residence.  The show also included a graphic discussion about the content of Girls Gone Wild videos, with callers and hosts providing explicit descriptions.  Updates on the "Naughty Nighty" contest continued throughout this section.

The broadcast shifted to the "It's the Bitches That'll Get You" bit, focusing on the financial ramifications of divorce for men, using Neil Diamond's divorce as a prime example.  The hosts' discussion devolved into misogynistic jokes and comments about women's roles in marriage and divorce, touching upon other celebrity divorces such as Larry King's and O.J. Simpson's.  Davida, a "Naughty Nighty" contestant, appeared in studio, prompting further sexually suggestive comments.  Listeners called in with various jokes and comments, including a "six o'clock queef" audio contribution. A caller reported on Mike Tyson's apology, and the show mentioned a rejection hotline service.


The final segment was plagued by technical difficulties with the "B Metro" soundboard, causing frustration and confusion regarding sound effects and the malfunctioning "Rejection Line" bit.  The hosts speculated about the buttons' functions and engaged in a running gag about various decades-themed TV shows. They promoted their "WOW sticker" campaign and "Whip them out Wednesday," featuring a woman in a promotional shirt. Numerous listener calls contributed to a "What Did We Learn Today?" segment, often with crude and offensive humor.  Adam Ferrar's appearance on "The Job" was mentioned, along with references to Jane Fonda and other celebrities.  The broadcast concluded with more technical issues, frustrated hosts, and final off-color listener contributions.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Yeah, welcome to the O.B. and Anthony Show.  Hello!  It's Whip'em Out Wednesday!  Oh, it is. Look at that.  We get that extra day on that Monday when we had the day off.  I kind of thought it was Tuesday.  Well, for us it is Tuesday. For you it's Wednesday.  I like that.  Those four-day weeks rock.  They do rock.  Whip'em Out Wednesday for the new cities.  Very simple.  You want to see boobs on the way home?  Well, this is what you do.  You put wow in the back of your car.  Or anywhere on your car.  Whether it's a bumper sticker that's available by some of the stations that we broadcast on. 
[00:00:30]  Or if you make a homemade wow sign, it works just as well.  The ladies, if they feel like it, they will show you their boobs if they see the wow in your car.  Right.  Right?  Right.  Two simple rules.  Do not harass the ladies and do not follow the ladies.  Plenty of them will just do it on their own.  It's the easiest thing in the world.  You just put the wow on and drive.  That's it.  It's all you've got to do. 
[00:01:00]  That ends your obligation to do anything else.  And if you want a wow sticker, go to opandanthony.com for info on that.  Okay?  Right.  All right.  You know what we're going to do?  We're going to start the show off with our Tyson commentary from yesterday.  Because everybody is talking about Tyson.  It's on the front page of just about every newspaper in America right now.  Yeah, they've got pictures of him just looking vicious.  Vicious.  Mike Tyson.  And now there's rumors that he's going to be arrested on rape.  Again. 
[00:01:30]  Not rumors.  It's definitely going to happen?  I, uh, here's, here's the story.  Police say they'll seek to arrest Tyson.  Evidence supporting rape allegation handed to district attorney.  So, um, I don't know.  I don't know if this fight's going to go down.  Whether from that debacle yesterday or this rape thing.  Rape is such an old thing for me.  It's an old hat.  They should just be used to it.  Tyson rapes.  Let him fight. 
[00:02:00]  Rape.  R-A-P-E.  You're damn right I know how to spell that.  You know how to spell that one.  And I know how to do it.  So, um, so we want to replay the Tyson thing from yesterday.  Yeah, so popular.  Uh, boy, other shows decided to, uh, do the exact same concept.  Do the same concept there.  The exact same, uh, angle.  That's all right.  Quite flattering, don't you think?  Sure.  So this is how we reported, uh, the Tyson incident yesterday on our show. 
[00:02:30]  Yesterday.  On our show.  Yesterday, yeah.  Yesterday.  It says, as the story broke.  Yesterday.  Which is the time before this morning.  That's correct.  Before this morning.  Before this morning.  Before this morning.  So I don't want to see one instant feedback.  There are so many different angles you can take on a story like this.  Right.  Some people chose to do the exact same angle we did yesterday.  I just know if somebody did something on a show in the morning, let's say, and then, um, we did it that afternoon, and it was similar, we'd get crucified. 
[00:03:00]  Hell yeah.  I don't know why, but we did something yesterday.  Yesterday.  And, um, same concept.  Turns up, uh, this morning.  This morning.  But I guess that's okay.  Sure, why not?  Yeah, why not?  So we're going to start the show with this, uh, the real reason, because it's just really, really funny.  And it's, uh, it's, uh, you know, it's a story that everyone's talking about. 
[00:03:30]  All right?  And, uh, and then, uh, remind me, we've got to talk about the Naughty Nighty contest today.  We've got to talk about, uh, uh, Abraham Lincoln.  Yes.  Abraham Lincoln was a woman.  Was a woman.  We have details.  I'm completely convinced.  You are insane.  And, uh, ask me about the Islander Ranger game yesterday.  Have some fun there.  Details on the way.  But here's us, uh, discussing Tyson yesterday. 
[00:04:00]  Hey, did they find Tyson?  I don't know.  I honestly don't know if they found him.  We were supposed to talk about Tyson about two hours ago, but he was running, uh, running loose in Manhattan.  And, quite frankly, uh, we're not brave.  We're a bunch of pussies.  And, uh, we want to make sure that he's been captured before we discuss the Tyson incident that happened today.  Right?  Make sure he's captured.  Captured.  Hopefully they shot him with a dart gun.  And he's back in his cage. 
[00:04:30]  All right.  Look, man.  Let's, let's shut off the computer so we can talk about Tyson.  Well, I was going through the other, uh, contestants.  He's a perv.  He can't even...  Yeah.  You see a girl's elbow, you're, you're done for an hour.  You are perverted.  Refocus.  Refocus.  The old crook of the arm, you loop up.  You've done that?  Yeah, he's right there.  While they're making muscles.  The last we heard, Tyson was running, uh, rampant down 6th Avenue. 
[00:05:00]  After he punched, uh, Lennox Lewis, he stepped up to the podium.  I saw the videotape.  Yeah, they were doing one of those, uh, press conferences there.  Press conference to announce the fight.  Supposed to be in April, in Vegas.  And, uh, I saw them both.  Lewis was on one of the podiums.  It was, like, on a little platform.  And, uh, Tyson was stepping onto his.  He stepped on it and kept going.  Stepped right over it and walked up to Lewis and pulls his arm back to hit him. 
[00:05:30]  Uh, people all of a sudden jump in.  You see Mike Tyson kind of go down out of the picture a little.  Which is when he supposedly bit Lennox Lewis on the ankle.  And, which at that point ripped his shoe and sock off.  From what I hear.  Because Lewis said he didn't have a, a sock on after that.  I think it was Lennox Lewis where Tyson said, I'll eat you and your children.  He goes, I, I'm, I want your heart. 
[00:06:00]  I will eat your children.  Yeah.  So, he's, he's insane.  Well, the obvious, uh, thing.  First of all, a lot of people were thinking, well, is it just, uh, you know, uh, uh, pre-fight hype?  A little publicity stunt.  Was this kind of like a WWF thing?  Mm-hmm.  And so far, all the people that were, uh, close on the scene there said, no, this is legit.  He lost his effing mind.  Uh, yeah, it, it was apparent, um, because Lennox Lewis and his people are not actors. 
[00:06:30]  And they were completely shocked and stunned when this happened.  And then, the funniest part of the whole thing, after this incident, he left wherever they were having the press conference and started running.  He ran out and started running down 6th Avenue in Manhattan.  Just a wild man.  Toward the Empire State Building.  Please remain calm.  He is, he is running toward the Empire State Building.  He has a blonde, I believe that's teen Melanie, in his head. 
[00:07:00]  You'll be safe.  Just try to stay away from him.  We have police and fire trucks after him now.  Don't shoot at him, it just makes him angry.  He's, he's, he's, last I heard, running wild down the streets.  We have a tape of him?  Yeah, we got it.  Because I gotta hear some of these clips. 
[00:07:30]  He, uh, before he ran out, he started yelling at some of the people in the audience.  Imagine being this guy, because he pointed at one guy and he's just bitching at him.  The guy must have just left fluid in his chair.  Because you don't know, the guy just bit Lennox Lewis.  Threw punches at people.  You don't know if he's gonna jump down in the crowd and, and kill you.  By the way, before we continue with this little segment, I just want to announce to, uh, the 18 cities that listen to us.  Yeah.  That, uh, Anthony does an incredible, and I mean, dead on Mike Tyson impression. 
[00:08:00]  Yes, you are.  It's Opie doing it.  No, no, no, no, no.  Because Mike, Mike Tyson is in New York today.  A lot of people know I do a lot of good voices, but, uh, Mike Tyson's not one of them, my friend.  Mike Tyson.  All right, here's, uh, Mike Tyson going nuts, Ant.  All right, let's hear.  You can't touch me, you're not man enough.  I'll eat your ass on the line, you bitch.  Oh, anybody in here can't f*** with this. 
[00:08:30]  This is the ultimate, man.  F*** you, you hoe.  Come and say my face, I'm f***ing your ass for everybody, you bitch.  Come on, you bitch.  You're a scared coward.  You're not man enough for f*** with me.  You can't lack two minutes in my world, bitch.  Look at you, scared now, you hoe.  Scared like a little white f***.  Scared of the real man.  I'll f*** you till you love me, f***.  Oh, yes!  Dude, I would have crapped my pants.  I'll f*** you till you love me.  That's what he just said. 
[00:09:00]  I'll f*** you till you love me.  And before that, he said, I'll f*** you in front of everybody.  In front of everybody.  You little white bitch, did he say?  Yeah.  Yeah, well, you know.  I'm sure that won't even make the papers.  No, I'm sure it won't.  Wait, I gotta hear that close to death.  That is fantastic, Mike Tyson.  At the beginning, it's just pandemonium, but then they kind of get the mic near him.  Yeah.  Genius.  Let's hear it again.  Oh, my God!  You get me!  You get me!  You get me!  You get me!  You get me!  You get me!  You can't touch me. 
[00:09:30]  You're not man enough.  Eat your a** on the line, you b***h.  Oh, anybody in here can't f*** with you.  This is the ultimate, man.  F*** you, you hoe.  Come and say my face, I'm f*** you a** for everybody, you b***h.  Come on, you b***h.  You're a scared coward.  You've not man enough to f*** with me.  You can't lack two minutes in my world, b***h.  Look at you scared now, you hoe.  Scared like a little white b***h.  Scared of the real man.  I'll f*** you till you love me, s***.  That must have been exactly what the rapes sounded like. 
[00:10:00]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, Anthony?  I'll f*** you till you love me.  Anthony?  Yeah.  I'm sorry, I was playing the wrong clip.  That's actual audio from Oz last night.  Was that an episode of Oz for last night?  Yeah, I'm sorry.  Jesus.  We'll find the title.  It's part of the love story.  The love story.  I'll f*** you until you love me.  I'll f*** you until you love me.  Come on, who's the real man now, you b***h?  You white b***h? 
[00:10:30]  Come on, you can't last in my world.  My world entails a big black thing going right in there.  Wow.  Oof.  I'm nowhere near the scene and I'm freaking out.  Can you imagine Tyson saying that to you?  Oscar, what's up?  Yo, guys.  Hey.  Yeah, just heard it over the police scanner.  The army and the Navy are going to try to drive Godzilla and Mothra into Manhattan to deal with Tyson.  It's on his way.  The help is on the way, guys.  Hang in there.  Thank you, Oscar. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah, come over here, Godzilla.  I'm going to F you.  I'm going to F you.  Bring it on, you little green b***h.  I will F you up.  I wish the beep were on the same channel as all these sounds.  But then I could say the F words with a beep.  We'll have to work on that.  Yes, we will, you b***h.  Yeah.  I'll make me come over there.  Oh, that's okay.  Brian, what's up?  Hey, man.  It's frigging Tyson. 
[00:11:30]  The guy's like the Incredible Hulk.  I'll make me come over here.  I'll make me angry.  You won't like me when I'm angry.  Oh, wait a minute.  I'm already angry.  Let me bite you and punch you.  You know what it was?  I'm getting a bad rap on this one.  When we came out and the curtains opened, all of a sudden there was a lot of flash photography and it got me upset.  Like it was flashing.  And I believe I did hear somebody say, don't take pictures. 
[00:12:00]  You're getting them all nervous.  But I kept seeing it.  They kept flashing and flashing the pictures.  So I broke my chains and I went out and bit a subway car in half.  But you can't blame me towards beauty killed the beast.  We all remember this clip from Tyson.  I'm on the Zoloft thing, right?  But I'm on that to keep me from killing y'all.  Yeah, that makes perfect sense.  I'm on the Zoloft to keep from killing y'all. 
[00:12:30]  But when I get taken off it by my managers before fight time, look out.  I'll rampage.  I'm heading toward the Empire State Building.  That's a short little climb.  I'm going to find me a blonde and get up there until they send the biplanes after me to shoot at me.  But I swat them down like nothing.  Come on, biplanes.  Come on, you little bitches.  I will F you.  That is probably the best Tyson clip ever. 
[00:13:00]  You want to hear it again?  I have to hear it again.  All right.  Well, let's hear the other two clips.  They're real short, I guess.  Tyson pre-fight.  I don't even know what this is.  Why don't we hear it real fast?  Go ahead.  I'll kick Lennox Lewis' motherf***ing ass.  You want to hear that one again?  Yeah, yeah.  I'll kick Lennox Lewis' motherf***ing ass.  I don't even know what he's saying.  I'll kick Lennox Lewis' motherf***ing ass.  Oh, okay.  Lennox Lewis, come here.  I'm going to f*** you. 
[00:13:30]  I'm going to f*** you in the...  Come here, white boy.  I'll f*** you right here.  Who was the guy he was yelling at?  Oh, my God.  It was some, I guess, reporter.  Good.  Jesus.  Do you want to hear that first one?  Yeah, let's hear the first one again.  You can't touch me. 
[00:14:00]  You're not man enough.  I'll eat your a** on the line, you b***h.  Oh, anybody in here can f*** with this.  This is the ultimate, man.  F*** you, you ho.  Come and say my face, I'm f*** you a** for everybody.  You b***h.  Come on, you b***h.  You're a sad coward.  You've got man enough to f*** with me.  You can't lack two minutes in my world, b***h.  Look at you scared now, you ho.  Scared like a little white b***h.  Scared of the real man.  I'll f*** you till you love me, f***. 
[00:14:30]  That's...  I usually reserve that language for my first date.  I will f*** you till you love me, b***h.  You're going to love me.  I will punch you in the face, you f***ing whore.  Now you love me?  No?  All right.  I'm going to have to tear it till it bleeds.  I'll show you the real man.  I'll show you the real man.  Hello, this is Mike Tyson.  If you're constipated, I will come to your house and give that same speech. 
[00:15:00]  You will not be constipated no more.  That will come out instantaneously.  Instantaneously.  F-O-C-R-L-Y-T.  You're going to tell me that's not how to spell it?  That's how the real man spell it.  I will f*** you till you love me.  That is one of the best lines ever.  Ever.  I will f*** you till you love me. 
[00:15:30]  Oh, that is the best Tyson impression I've ever heard in my life.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Oh, yeah.  Stop, Jimmy.  ESPN website said that a reporter yelled, you should be, oh, you should be in a straitjacket.  That seems to be what said him.  The reporter should be in a straitjacket for saying that out loud.  You're going to say that to that guy?  I love Tyson.  This makes me love him more and want him to be champion again.  This is what I want a boxer to be like, a maniac.  Right.  Don't be mistaken here.  This is the Tyson we want to see. 
[00:16:00]  It's the Tyson we love.  Anytime this stuff happens, the reporters love it.  People love it.  That guy said he should be in a straitjacket.  Hey, he should be.  But you love watching it.  And we're getting more reports.  Of course, Tyson is supposedly still loose in the city somewhere.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Dave, what's going on?  Hey, how you doing, guys?  All right.  Hey, I just heard on CNN, apparently he's on a scaffolding outside of a building that's  under construction.  Yeah.  He's throwing barrels at some cops.  The cops are trying to climb up the ladders. 
[00:16:30]  We don't have a confirmation yet, I believe.  There's one guy, Mario.  Mario somebody.  We don't have confirmation on his last name yet.  Mario's a little bitch.  I see him tell you.  He's trying to come up.  I'm throwing barrels down on him.  That's right.  And it plays all 80s video game music as I do it.  But he's a bitch.  Little Mario.  Come here, Mario.  I'll show you the real man.  I'll throw barrels down on you.  He's jumping over the barrels, Mike.  All right.  Have a good one, guys.  All right, Dave.  He keeps jumping over, but I keep throwing him down. 
[00:17:00]  I'll get him.  He ain't going to get up here.  That bitch.  Ray's checking in.  Ray, you're next on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Hey, guys.  It's on the news.  The city is scheduling aerial spraying of Zoloft in the parks and sewers.  Hey, I'll tell you what.  When they catch him, though, they should fly him down to that prison in Cuba where they're  in open cages.  It'll scare the crap out of the prisoners.  Yeah, they don't think they're being treated right.  Send Tyson down there for a little pep talk. 
[00:17:30]  Hello, Taliban.  Now, the first lesson, I'm going to F you till you love me.  Now, bend over.  I'm going to do it right through the open chain link fence houses you're living in with  your sorry ass.  And then I got an invite to see that John Walker guy.  He got a cute mouth.  M-O-U-F.  Mouth.  I spelled that right.  Sure, that's how you spell it.  That's right, you b***h.  I know.  That's exactly how you spell it.  Yeah. 
[00:18:00]  Crocodile Hunter should be brought up.  He's a squirrely one.  Got me tranquilizer darts.  That just pissed me off there, Ozzy.  Now, I'm going to F you till you love me.  What would you do, seriously, if Tyson walked through that door right now?  Get a picture with him.  I cramp myself.  A picture with him?  Yeah.  I cramp myself.  I love Tyson.  I cramp myself.  I love him.  You would crap himself because you make fun of him.  I don't.  It's not making fun.  It's an homage. 
[00:18:30]  I would go through that studio window.  Yeah.  Pray for the best and hopefully make the corner before he does.  I would get you.  Yeah, you would.  If you think you're getting away from Mike Tyson, I'll find you.  Unless they take me back to Skull Island and lock me up behind a big wooden barricade.  I was happy there, fighting the dinosaurs, the jungle people leaving bitches for me, to F until they love me.  Then I would eat them.  Then they had to take me to New York and chain me up and take pictures of me and scare me. 
[00:19:00]  That's why I climbed the Empire State Building.  I'm so misunderstood.  Misunderstood.  L-T-5-H.  Well, sure, L-T-5-H.  Yeah, look, it says it right here in my thesaurus.  Very good.  Holy S.  Mike.  Hey, what's up?  How are you?  Hey, bud.  Yo, right in the beginning of that clip, he says, I will eat your a-hole.  No way. 
[00:19:30]  Does he?  I swear to God.  Why do you think?  I got to hear it.  All right, let's listen for that.  There's a little Easter egg in there.  A little Easter egg.  Let's listen for I will eat your a-hole.  Go ahead.  You can't touch me.  You're not mad enough.  I'll eat your a-hole on the line, you bitch.  Anybody in here can't f**k with this.  This is the ultimate, man.  You f**k you, you ho.  Come and say my face, I'm f**king your a-hole for everybody. 
[00:20:00]  You bitch.  Come on, you bitch.  You're scared, coward.  You've got mad enough for f**k with me.  You can't lack two minutes in my world, bitch.  Look at you scared now, you ho.  Scared like a little white f**k.  Scared of the real man.  I'll f**k you till you love me, f**k.  Is that supposed to be sexy?  I will eat your a-hole in front of everyone.  Oh, that's a man.  It's a delicacy in China. 
[00:20:30]  Yeah, I'm sure.  The a-hole is lightly marinated in teriyaki or soy sauce.  I get them confusing.  And then you must bread the a-hole and fry it.  And it's wonderful.  It's like calamari.  That is what we love.  We want to see Tyson out of his mind.  Now they're saying that the fight might not happen because of this. 
[00:21:00]  It's all about.  The fight is happening.  They're saying the boxing commission can just say, no, get out of here.  This is what boxing needs.  How great is this?  They'll take the money and run.  This is perfect.  They'll find a way to spin it.  This fight has to happen now.  Now they've got all the hype they ever could dream of.  Now I guess I'll have to spend my time hunting for Marky Mark.  In the spaceship.  On your knees. 
[00:21:30]  Charles, what's up?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Forget the Zorro.  The next press conference, they've got a real-ass guy on a head of a lecture and a straightjack and a muzzle.  He's always insane.  He is insane.  Thank you, guys.  All right.  Actually, this was a tape from my wedding night with Robin Givens.  It was my wedding tape.  First, we danced.  And then she danced with her father. 
[00:22:00]  And then that's when I said to her, I'll F you till you love me.  I'll eat your a-holes.  She kind of liked that part, though.  Wonderful.  Anthony, I love that Mike Tyson impression.  Seriously, it gets me every time.  I love it.  It's a character.  Especially when he tries to spell and stuff.  I just do a character.  Like Mr. Imus.  It's a character.  And there you have it.  There you go.  We want to replay that because that's like a huge story here. 
[00:22:30]  Well, everywhere.  Everywhere.  It's Tyson.  There you have it.  All right.  A couple phone numbers in the New York area.  877-692-1027.  Anywhere else.  866-2774.  Wow.  When we get back, we're going to have an update on the Naughty 90 contest, Anthony.  Right.  Got to talk about the Ranger-Iona game a little bit.  Neil Diamond in the news.  And I think he's in the Bitches That'll Get You segment.  Correct.  Yeah.  Colin Quinn stopping by to say hi today.  Our buddy, our pal.  He got a new show that's going to be starting up. 
[00:23:00]  I heard something about it in the post, but I don't know.  Well, ask him.  He'll be here in a few minutes.  Yeah.  And OJ's girlfriend has disappeared.  Uh-oh.  We didn't get to that yesterday, so we can discuss that a little bit as well, okay?  I know.  Is this a brand of humor you can appreciate?  All right.  Let me get a little saucy here.  For the love of Eve, you bet.  Life serves you up lemons.  You make lemonade.  We're a little out of control here.  Stop cracking wise.  Oh, my stars.  Don't f*** yourself.  Tasteless offensive. 
[00:23:30]  A lot of ass grabbing.  Horrific and tasteless.  People going deaf.  It just makes me want to stick a knife in someone.  Stuff you get here on this show.  Aren't we supposed to be trained to gain listeners, guys?  No!  The OPNW Show.  Is that a surprise to you?  Yeah.  M-E-W.  Cool!  The Tool CD definitely growing on me finally.  Took a little time, and I'm a huge Tool fan.  You like the Tool, Opie?  Loving the new Tool. 
[00:24:00]  Can't pronounce half the songs, but who cares?  Yeah.  They still rock.  What's wrong, Jim?  It's a portable phone.  Yeah, in New York, we just aired the commercial for that 80s show.  Oh, it's all over the place.  Oh, that aired everywhere?  Oh, you know that one's everywhere.  I thought that all in the family was well written.  No, I'm not on a paid phone.  I'm in a bar.  It's a portable phone!  A portable phone! 
[00:24:30]  And the show already, damn it.  Everyone's going to check it out.  A portable phone!  You guys thought Fred Sanford was funny.  Oh, man.  I don't know.  That could be one of the most annoying commercials.  No, the second most annoying, because in New York, we have the lotto commercial.  If I had a million dollars...  Shut up!  If I had a million dollars...  I'd buy you a...  There you go. 
[00:25:00]  That's better.  Naughty Nighty contest is on, Anthony.  I was just checking out the contestant from Cleveland.  Cleveland has entered the contest officially, Anthony.  And who's representing Cleveland so far?  The lovely Shannon.  Shannon, who's doing a naughty nurse type thing.  Naughty Nurses.  Wasn't that the video?  Yeah, this Naughty Nurses 1, 2, and 3, yeah. 
[00:25:30]  That Pee Wee spanked it, too?  That's a naughty nurse, wasn't it?  Naughty Nurses?  I don't know.  Yeah.  It was Naughty Nurses.  Spank my monkey!  Colin Quinn!  What's up, Colin?  And now, your host, Ken Olber!  We were just talking about that.  We spoke to Ken Olber yesterday.  You did?  Yeah.  How's he doing?  Oh, fantastic.  What the hell's he doing these days?  Oh, he's doing fantastic.  He's just fantastic.  Hey, Colin, the microphone is five feet to your left there. 
[00:26:00]  Is it hot?  It's hot.  It's hot.  We're on.  Anyway.  Hey, so the Naughty 90 contest is up and running.  We have only four contestants so far.  This is very pathetic.  Well, you know, quantity.  But if it's like any other Opie and Anthony contest, it will pick up.  But we're hoping it picks up soon, right?  I think quality outweighs quantity this time.  Look at the young teen Melanie from yesterday.  19 years old.  Show them the dumper.  Look at that. 
[00:26:30]  Like a snare drum.  That's like one of those rubber dodge balls.  Oh, we have five contestants.  Five.  Five.  Five?  Five contestants.  And then we have Candy.  I don't want to get dirty, but she had some shape, that gal.  Oh, hey, easy.  Easy there, Colin.  Some figure.  She had a cute figure.  You love when the old grandmas talk like that.  She had a cute figure. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah.  We call it nice crapper, grandma.  Nice it her.  So we have five contestants.  Yeah.  Candy.  If you like, your lady is a little darker, Colin.  Look at that.  That's a face full of booty right there.  Why don't you let De Niro vote in this?  He would love that.  Yeah, De Niro would like that.  I like the shadow in the crack area.  You like that?  It gets really, that's like the dark crevice. 
[00:27:30]  It gets nice and dark in there.  I like mine with syrup.  The sun's setting over a canyon.  A canyon.  Candy.  Yeah, but I think Teen Melanie is a fan favorite.  Amy, we got her in there.  She's a nice breasted gal.  Big breasted gal.  Let's see, Amy, that's still Melanie.  Unless they have the same outfit.  Amy's over there on that one.  Let me see Amy again.  I got a...  Let me go back to Amy. 
[00:28:00]  Oh, Amy.  She's the naughty housewife.  Look at that.  The real wife, yeah.  Yeah, she's pretty good.  She looks like a mail-order bride.  Dude, I spanked her website last night.  You did?  I'm not kidding.  I really got a good one off.  Yeah.  It was very sexy.  Well, but wait a minute.  That's a rousing endorsement for a website.  It's very true.  If she has her own website, how could she be in the contest?  I like that old amateur illusion that it's called.  Yeah.  Well, yeah.  It'll be up to the website.  You can't trick the listeners, though, Colin.  We've learned.  You're right.  She's real, though.  She's got real breasts.  She's very sexy.  So, should we explain the Naughty 90 contest again, Ant? 
[00:28:30]  Because Sacramento has joined the contest.  Uh-huh.  And they need an explanation of what a Naughty 90 contest is?  Well, this is what's going on, Colin.  We're syndicated to a lot of cities, as you know.  Right.  Yeah.  So, girls could show up at different radio stations all over America right now.  You're syndicated to a lot of cities and Sacramento.  And Sacramento.  No, and Portland.  Sacramento is one of the biggies.  So, basically, here in New York, ladies in the New York area, you stop by with your Naughty 90 between now and 7 today, 
[00:29:00]  and we'll take your pictures, put you up on the website.  Very easy for the New York audience today.  Right, Ant?  Right.  Now, if you're in, this is where it gets complicated, so listen up.  If you're in Boston, Philly, Buffalo, Washington, Cleveland, or Sacramento, and you hear our voices right now,  that means right now you can show up at the radio station with your Naughty 90 and get your pictures taken.  Just go down there.  Just go down there.  If you need the address to any of those stations, just go to opanthony.com to see the contestants we have thus far, 
[00:29:30]  to get the rules of the contest, and get the addresses of the radio stations we're on so you can show up with your Naughty 90, okay?  Uh-huh.  The girl from Cleveland did that yesterday while we were on the air.  And now she's in.  She is in.  More girls in the Cleveland area, you can stop by today.  We're hoping someone from Boston will represent soon.  Hoping someone from Philly and Washington and Buffalo, Cleveland, and Sacramento will represent soon, Ant.  Yes.  And the fine folks that help us run the show in those cities, call us when someone shows up at your station with their Naughty 90. 
[00:30:00]  Yeah.  All right.  I want to talk.  What happens when you win?  When a trip to hedonism.  Really?  Yeah.  Really?  How sick is that?  Yeah.  Well, Ms. McGillicuddy.  Yeah.  That guy.  A trip for two to hedonism, three.  He was a voice on the Flintstones.  He was a Flintstones voice all the time. 
[00:30:30]  Remember when Fred bought the bowling ball and he wanted to bring it back?  And he goes, my fingers don't fit in the holes.  He goes, well, perhaps if you'd watched them.  I love that guy.  That's a great line.  How do you remember that?  I love that.  I've watched that stuff for my whole life.  All right.  And also, second prize is 500 bucks.  Third prize.  500 bucks?  $250 for the Naughty 90 contest.  All right.  Let's go to Doug from Springfield.  Doug, what's going on today, man?  Rangers. 
[00:31:00]  How you doing?  Islanders.  A poosahs.  Doesn't know your team.  What happened?  Hey, Doug.  One friggin' win.  Way to keep a lead, geek.  One win in 2002.  And what does that mean?  Slow down.  First of all, I'll tell you what it means.  The Islanders are still ahead of the Rangers.  Oh, well.  Are they not?  And what does that mean?  And the Islanders have more wins than all of last year, right?  Oh, well, that's because the Rangers sell out more than the Islanders.  It's so stupid.  We're doing just fine, Doug.  We had a little meltdown yesterday at the Coliseum. 
[00:31:30]  Meltdown?  You had a volcano go out on an island.  Even worse.  Everyone knows I have some tickets to the Islander games, Anthony.  Uh-huh.  I get to go to about half the home games.  Yeah.  The problem is there.  There's a 7 o'clock start.  We're on the air until 7.  If we don't have a Jim Brewer bit laying around, you know, I've got to stick it out to 7.  So I missed the first period, all right?  Thank God not much excitement happens the first period of this Islander-Ranger game.  I missed one of the greatest periods in hockey history.  Last night.  I was listening to the game on the radio. 
[00:32:00]  Sorry, Deron Efes, but, you know, the Islanders are on.  I'm heading to the game.  I've got to listen, you know?  They're screaming and yelling, oh, my God, this has got to be the greatest period in hockey history.  They were just losing their effing minds, all right?  You're where?  I'm stuck in traffic.  I'm stuck in traffic.  I'm having with Flurry at the end of the game.  He gave the fans a salute, or what happened with that?  We were taunting him behind the goal all night long.  What were you guys saying?  That guy is insane.  He was thinking about how he could get over the boards behind the goal to get to the fans.  The guy is not right.  I mean, there's been a lot of stories written about this guy. 
[00:32:30]  Yeah.  It is all true, man.  He is just not stable, this guy.  He rocks.  I love him.  Oh, whatever, Rick.  Love him.  He shot Mike Peck a pussy, doing that knee shot on Lindros.  A bunch of pussies.  Cairns is the only tough guy.  You don't want to hear it, huh?  So, basically, I missed the whole first period, which I knew was going to happen.  I just hope all the action is going to be in the second and third period.  I missed seven goals, three fights, and plenty of penalties. 
[00:33:00]  I get there.  Second period, Rangers score, one goal.  Islanders score, none.  No fights, barely any penalties.  Third period, Rangers score, one goal.  No goals for the Islanders, no penalties, no fights.  It was so boring in the second and third period.  Islanders lose 5-4 after leading 4-1.  Did you almost lose your mind, though, when you thought they tied it?  With, like, ten minutes to go in the third, it was, like, right off the crossbar.  The place, I don't want to, it's just a hockey game, but the place went nuts. 
[00:33:30]  Because the guy behind, the goal judge, he's got, like, an itchy finger.  Yeah, hit the goal light.  Well, the red lights go flash, and the place goes absolutely insane.  They go upstairs with the call for about ten minutes.  They ruled it a forward pass, right?  They ruled no goal.  Took the energy out of the place.  Game over pretty much after that.  Ah, sorry to hear that.  Great game.  Well, thank God you aren't taking young Gary to that game.  No, I...  You'd have missed a lot of excitement.  Good thing you're waiting for a real good game when you could get there on time. 
[00:34:00]  Anthony, in hindsight, it turned out to be not the game I should have brought Gary to.  Young 12-year-old Gary.  Because he would have missed the first period with me, and then he would have had two very boring periods.  He's eagerly awaiting Opie taking him to a game.  You hear about this, Colin?  No.  Little 12-year-old kid.  I hope he's a relative, at least, is he?  No, actually, just a listener.  He, Opie promised to take the little lad to a hockey game.  And he's just been kind of pushing them to the side there. 
[00:34:30]  Wow.  He's going to grow up with the wrong message.  Anthony, a promise is a promise.  I just don't know what game to bring him to yet.  How about a hockey game?  You have the tickets.  One of the hundred you go to.  Yeah, exactly.  Well, all the games during the week don't make sense because I missed the first period.  Pivotal point.  I need a lad's life, and you are going to send him the wrong message.  You are creating this human being.  Anthony, I'm doing this.  Michael Jackson, Macaulay Culkin, all over again.  Exactly.  Little Webster.  You've got to sit him on your lap at the game. 
[00:35:00]  It's not about the game.  It's about spending time with you.  That's why.  Right.  It has nothing to do with the game.  He's going to spend time with me.  He'd rather spend three periods with me instead of two, right?  Or two periods and maybe a little ice cream sundae after.  There you go.  It doesn't have to just be about hockey.  One period in the Naughty Nighty contest.  I'm just looking for the right.  I was 12.  That's what I want to go.  It could be about, you know, maybe throwing a ball in the park or something.  I'm looking for the right situation, which is a weekend game with a sub-500 team. 
[00:35:30]  Is that it?  And not many of those are coming up in the near future.  So maybe you toss him a ball and, good eye, Gary, good eye.  Good eye.  Good eye.  Now get in the bag.  Keep your eye on it.  Don't be afraid of the ball.  Yeah, it's just a bag.  Crinkle, crinkle.  Oh, well.  Opie's like the great Santini.  Yeah.  I just want to throw the bass on the back of that kid's head.  Hit him on the back there.  One of the greatest scenes in movie history, by the way.  Yes, yes. 
[00:36:00]  Hey, sports fans.  You get a squirt?  You get a squirt?  You get a squirt?  No, he's like our other buddy from, you know, De Niro.  Shut your pie hole.  Shut your cake hole from, you know, your goddamn pie hole.  I want to see Opie in a Boy Scout uniform with a cake.  You shut your pie hole.  Is there mustard left in that jar, Gary?  You guys suck, man.  You've got to help the kid out.  I'm going to take care of Gary.  All right.  I'm on record.  Dwight and Anthony show. 
[00:36:30]  Dwight.  Yeah.  That was it.  That was it, Dwight.  Dwight.  All right.  Hey, Colin.  Yeah?  Abraham Lincoln was a woman.  What?  I'm buying it, man.  I'm going to show you the picture.  You want to see the picture?  I never knew Ansel Adams snapped this one.  He looked like a tranny, actually.  Look.  Yeah, well, that's what they're saying.  Oh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They could tell I'm looking at the cover of them.  They didn't have Photoshop in the 1800s.  That is not a doctored photo. 
[00:37:00]  No.  Look at the little, cute little fuzzy hat he's got on.  What about the beard that he always had?  I can explain that, my friend.  That actually, with a mold in.  Nicole Kidman.  Look, I'll show you a better one.  Isn't that just a black and white picture of Cindy Crawford now?  With the big mole?  The Lincoln mole?  There's Baberham.  Who looks HIV positive in that picture?  Baberham Lincoln.  Look, look, Colin.  Baberham Lincoln in a long-flowing dress.  Yeah, it couldn't possibly be doctored.  And it's in a newspaper.  It's got to be true.  No, no, no. 
[00:37:30]  It is not a newspaper.  That's the only historical figure anybody that reads that knows.  That's why they have to put it about him.  Where's President Batboy?  What are you talking about?  It says news right on the cover.  Yeah, right on the weekly world.  News!  Are they actually claiming now that Lincoln was a woman?  Yes, Anthony.  And what's the proof?  Abraham Lincoln was a woman, and the discovery of a secret cachet of 43 photographs shot by  a famed Lincoln photographer proves it.  Hence, the photographs.  Let me say, I see one of the photographs there.  Abe Lincoln with his beard looking very Lincoln-ish sitting there. 
[00:38:00]  And then, next to that is a picture of Lincoln wearing one of those big 1800s hats.  Chapeaus.  Yes.  Now, what is that proof?  Well, let me see.  Where he gets his goddamn news from.  Maybe they're thinking that only a dumb broad would have signed that emancipation nonsense.  Wow!  That could be one of the most racist things I've heard.  Wow! 
[00:38:30]  Unbelievable.  Look at him standing with the troops there.  He has kind of a girlish figure, doesn't he?  No!  He's wearing a stovepipe hat, and he's standing with the troops.  All right.  I see nothing womanly about that.  Can I read some facts, Anthony?  All right.  Yeah, that's what I want.  Facts, not fake pictures.  Although President Lincoln was known as honest Abe, it turns out she fibbed about one thing  to the American people, her gender.  Oh.  Ah.  Ah, let's see.  All right, here's some of the evidence.  The discovery of a birth certificate for a baby girl named Abigail Lincoln, born in Kentucky 
[00:39:00]  on February 12th, 1809.  The same place and date as President Lincoln.  Uh-huh.  Hold on.  Is this in the same paper that I'm reading in the front?  Astronaut held hostage by space alien?  Well, yeah.  All right.  Just like to know where I'm getting my news.  And 12-year-old boy shunned for a hockey game.  You don't, uh, there's aliens and stuff.  Of course.  You know that, right?  A proof.  Where's the proof?  Go ahead.  All right.  All right.  Birth certificate.  New medical evidence that Lincoln suffered from Marfin syndrome, a disorder that can make 
[00:39:30]  women unusually tall and gaunt.  With long, dangling limbs and big hands.  Really?  Okay.  Now, this is the big evidence right here.  A jar of glue used by actors to apply fake beards found among Lincoln's personal effects  at the Smithsonian Museum.  So, it was a fake beard.  Along with a dozen sanitary napkins, my friend.  Oh, Lincoln on the rags.  Maybe she was just walking on her hands all the time to look like a beard. 
[00:40:00]  Did they have sanitary napkins back then?  Or was it just claw?  Yeah, really.  Because they called it a rag.  Yeah.  It's in print right there.  A dozen sanitary napkins.  Lincoln flying on the wings of a maxi.  All right.  How about this for evidence?  Yeah.  A long-missing page from the diary of John Wilkes Booth in which the presidential assassin  rails against the White House lover who spurned me.  Is that why he shot Lincoln?  Oh.  Because Lincoln spurned his advances? 
[00:40:30]  Well, there's a sub-story here.  There was, was assassin John Wilkes Booth Abe's lover?  Oh.  Oh.  And finally, the fact that autopsy photos taken of Lincoln's nude body were suspiciously  burned.  Suspiciously burned.  Burned.  His nude body.  The picture.  Because he doesn't have a schlong.  Right.  Because they could prove it with the autopsy photos.  But we can't find them anymore.  Wasn't she having sex with her male secretary whose name was Kennedy? 
[00:41:00]  Kennedy.  Yes.  The Kennedy-Lincoln thing.  Right.  Lincoln was a female.  And then you got some Lexington historian saying, at first I thought it was just wartime  propaganda, but when I took a closer look at a photo of Lincoln, I realized the beard  does look bogus.  Oh.  Bogus beard.  Are you out of your mind?  What?  You do not actually believe this, do you?  Yeah.  There's an author quote here.  It says Lincoln was the mother, not the father of six children. 
[00:41:30]  All right.  So Lincoln was pregnant, too, at some point?  Yeah.  How did he hide that?  No.  She hid her pregnancy.  She.  Uh-huh.  With the long flowing dresses that I showed you.  Look.  Oh, that's pregnant Lincoln right there.  You can't really tell.  No.  Not at all.  Right?  Colin, you're with me, right?  Yeah.  Well, maybe that's because she was on a period.  She had to wear those flowing dresses.  Right.  Stop the flowing.  With the maxi pads.  Or whatever.  That's why she spurned John Wilkes Booth.  Yeah.  She was having a period. 
[00:42:00]  Passing herself off as a young man, she went on to work in macho jobs such as rail  splitter and surveyor.  Even enlisting as a volunteer in the Black Hawk Indian War, Anthony.  How about that?  I love history.  Isn't that good?  I love the idea of a rail splitter.  Sounds like a hell of a...  That's what they called old Abe Lincoln.  Yeah.  Rail splitter.  The old rail splitter.  What the hell?  Maybe it wasn't one.  I'm sold, Opie.  You sold me.  Look.  You sold me.  Could people please never bring this in for Opie again? 
[00:42:30]  He's very naive when it comes to these stories.  They didn't have Photoshop back then, Ian.  Look at the pictures.  Right?  I'm looking.  Finley, what's up?  Hey, there's like one way to really tell the truth.  Like, if this whole thing is true.  Yeah.  Does it say AP at the end of the article?  Ah.  Associated Press.  Oh, my God.  I didn't check for the AP.  No.  Is there an AP?  Let me see.  Oh, my God.  Check it.  I better say AP.  Because if it says AP...  Well, it says Weekly World News. 
[00:43:00]  No, no.  No.  Let me go to the end here.  Uh-uh.  No AP.  No, that's as bad as Bartlett.  It's that Weekly News.  All right.  Thank you.  And there is one fact that I heard, that in the theater, John Wilkes Booth was actually  rubbing her shoulders, saying, what a large back for a president.  Then went home to wash the man breath off his junk.  Yes.  Right, Norton?  Yeah, that's why he's not.  Sounds familiar.  It does.  Aaron, what's up?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  You know, it's funny.  I bought the same paper you did, and my friend was laughing at me when I bought it, and she 
[00:43:30]  was cracking up.  But, hey, I mean, it's hilarious.  But even more important...  What's so hilarious about it?  This is history, my friend.  Hope he believes it, sir.  We're rewriting it right now.  Right.  But even more important than that are, if you turn the page, the giant cockroaches that are invading  Cleveland.  Yeah, there are giant cockroaches invading Cleveland, Anthony.  Wow.  We have to go and save teen Melanie.  They're as big as cats, and they eat, what, a loaf of bread at a time?  Yeah, they can pick a dog clean in 15 minutes.  That's right.  Ah.  And look, they got pictures of the cockroaches. 
[00:44:00]  11 inches long.  They got the pictures of the cockroaches climbing the buildings, Anthony.  Yes, they do.  What?  Oof.  Mmm.  Thank you, Aaron.  All right, later, guys.  I suspect they've killed 168 dogs and cats in the past month.  Mostly strays, but also pets that were allowed outdoors unleashed.  Look out, Cleveland.  Roaches.  Giant roaches.  Can someone take this away?  John, what's going on?  Hey, guys. 
[00:44:30]  What's going on, man?  Hey.  Hey.  Listen, you guys are saying Lincoln had a girlish figure.  The man was 6'6".  He's got the Adam's apple the size of a grapefruit.  Yeah.  What are you guys looking at?  Well, it was that disease that was mentioned in the article.  That's what it is.  Oh, my God.  That almost tricked me, too, until they mentioned that disease that makes women kind of look more  like men with the big hands and stuff.  What, steroids and female bodybuilding?  Yeah, why not?  All right, John.  Thank you.  Not near a God. 
[00:45:00]  Thank you, mister.  David, you're next to the O.P. and Anthony Show.  What's up?  Yeah, I'm just wondering.  Are you going to start telling us Hillary Clinton's actually a woman?  There's actually a...  What was the one we picked up the other day?  What?  About Clinton's cheating.  Yeah, Clinton has four babes.  He's got four chicks that he's rotating around.  With Mike Tyson, one of them.  And Hillary just, well, is that true? 
[00:45:30]  That in Ford's theater, it wasn't the first time John Wilkes Booth gave a shot to the back  of Lincoln's head?  Hillary apparently had a private eye, hired a private eye to keep tabs on Bill.  They have an arrangement going.  I completely believe this.  Now, this is in the Enquirer, the National Enquirer.  You're going to believe stories in the Enquirer before you believe stories in the weekly world  news?  I will tell you a story about these publications. 
[00:46:00]  The Star and the Enquirer are true.  They do things on celebrities and whatnot, and they are true.  And Opie's naive.  They had a thing on...  What was that called?  They're not all true, because they had a thing on me once with this other comedian.  Yeah.  We went to this nightclub.  Yeah.  That was almost like his female little date while he pushed around.  His publicist sent it in.  Who was this?  This was Larry Miller years ago.  Really?  It was almost like, oh, the club owner wouldn't let them in.  And it's like...  And then Larry pushed him aside and said, we go anywhere we want. 
[00:46:30]  And meanwhile, like, I guess I was supposed to be on his arm with my purse.  Like, good deal.  Really?  You were Larry Miller's date?  Well, no.  See, this is how it gets into the weekly world news now.  Yeah.  From the Enquirer.  Yeah, it was Larry Miller's date, and...  Well, it's a long story.  I believe the Enquirer, though.  I really do.  Why do you believe the Enquirer before the weekly world news?  Well, because Lincoln is hard-pressed to sue the weekly world news.  These people could turn around and file suit against these. 
[00:47:00]  Sometimes they do.  Yeah.  When they do print something false.  But unless I see lawsuit, I take everything they say as gospel.  And this one has Clinton around with girls.  Hillary is getting really pissed off, because this isn't the arrangement they had when they left the White House.  It says, you promised never to do anything to embarrass me, she said.  You swore your philandering days were over.  You violated that agreement.  That's what Hillary said.  You know that's the agreement. 
[00:47:30]  And you know damn well a guy that was getting hummers in the Oval Office is not going to stop.  He's not stopping.  That's true.  Make you stop spanking it.  Norton, go ahead.  If somebody said stop whacking it, are you going to?  I can't even stop getting prostitutes.  Exactly.  If you have the balls to get oral in the White House, of course you're...  Clinton is a sex addict.  He's a sex addict.  He likes banging.  And he likes getting hummers.  That's what he does.  Just ask.  Sex addict?  That's a guy. 
[00:48:00]  I know.  And all guys are sex addicts.  The guy loves it.  He got the...  When he had the state troopers down there in Arkansas getting them all the babes and stuff.  Well, babes.  Getting them the girls.  They weren't quite babes.  But now they have this agreement.  Now Hillary is wearing the pants in the family.  She's out there.  Thank God she is.  Yes.  Yeah.  Wrap those things up.  But they had an arrangement.  Hillary said she'd busted him.  Bad.  One day she walked in to his office and he was on the phone. 
[00:48:30]  Bill began talking in a muffled voice.  Hi, yeah.  I'm going to take that and I'm going to shove it in there.  Hillary went ballistic.  I'm going to F you until you love me.  What was she doing up in the hall?  Until you love me.  I don't know.  She busted his office.  What was she up there for?  You like it like that, you bitch, don't you?  Let me tell you something.  I am going to F you until you love me.  I will eat your F hole. 
[00:49:00]  Don't F with me, faggot.  You can't live in my f***ing world.  So she walks in.  He starts talking in a muffled voice.  Hillary went ballistic telling him, I know there's a woman on the other end of that line.  Then she stormed out that night.  They were to have gone to the theater together.  But she snapped over her shoulder. 
[00:49:30]  Take one of your bimbos.  I'm disgusted.  You spoil everything for me.  Hillary's ambition is to be America's first woman president.  And it's hard for her to enhance her image when she had a disgraced president for her partner.  But he's out.  Who is he out with?  Julie Bowen?  Sale Johnson?  Saffron Burroughs?  And Ghislaine Maxwell?  Well, he's with that, like...  He is up in Harlem, isn't he? 
[00:50:00]  Ghislaine, Saffron?  They're all white chicks.  Oh.  Some of them on TV shows and whatnot.  The best part about that article is the faces they got.  Clinton making and Hillary making.  Yeah, Hillary's yelling at Bill, who's got his head in his hands.  But they're from two different pictures.  This isn't really about Bill and Hillary.  This is about all men and women.  How could she be shocked walking in and being outraged after all these times it's happened?  It's all about everybody.  If he's only on the phone, she should be happy.  Yes.  You know, there could have been times she walked in, hi, how you doing? 
[00:50:30]  She's almost done.  And she's supposed to be this strong woman.  Why doesn't she just dump him then?  She's not a strong woman.  She is not.  She's like every other smacked around woman.  Misses picture of strength.  Ew.  Just dump him.  She won't.  It's bad for the enemy.  Exactly.  And she wants to be present.  I hope he starts hitting her.  I'd love if he just starts smacking her.  Shut your mouth.  Watch her.  I should.  She's got a lot of makeup at her next conferences.  Hi.  Hi.  You got sunglasses.  I'm set at some committee.  Hi. 
[00:51:00]  Oh, hell.  Here they come.  Look, you hit your head on the counter.  You're telling that, bitch.  I swear, because when they leave, I'm going to F you up, bitch.  Hi.  Hi, officer.  Come on in.  But I'm a senator.  I didn't touch the fine senator from New York, did I?  Don't say it, bitch.  Hi.  Come on in.  Oh, damn the cops.  I'm going to go hide under the kiddie pool in the backyard. 
[00:51:30]  Maybe they won't find me.  Clinton's on the run.  He's running down the street.  I'm in pursuit.  All right, here's what happened.  All right.  All right.  Look, yeah, I've been drinking, OK?  I've been drinking, but God damn, it's my house.  It's my house, OK?  I can do what I want.  This bitch has been, you know, you don't know what it's like to live with her. 
[00:52:00]  Them fat legs.  And now she wants to be president, and I just get to sit around.  No, I'm going to F you up, whoever I want.  Let me go.  This is my house.  This is my house.  Haul him away.  Throw him in the back of the car.  Ah, Luke, what's going on, man?  Hey, I don't know if you're still talking about this, but it's true about Lincoln.  It is true, right?  It is totally true.  The play that they were going to see the night he was assassinated, La Caja Falls. 
[00:52:30]  Yeah, jackass.  There you go, Ant.  Yeah, they had dinner at Lucky Chang's, and went to see the country fall.  All right, thank you, Luke.  Yep.  Lucky Chang's a fine place to have dinner.  What?  Let's take a break.  Colin Quinn in the studio today.  Yes.  Colin, what is this?  I'm hearing about a show.  You're hearing all kinds of buzz.  I'm hearing, I am hearing a buzz.  I'm hot.  I've got a show. 
[00:53:00]  Well, we'll talk about it after the spots.  Well, I got this potted up so we can do the F.U. on it.  Oh.  And take a little break, and then we'll talk to Colin and stuff.  Yes.  And hopefully some ladies are on their way down the studios to join the Naughty Nighty contest, Ant.  Nice.  We haven't had a...  Nice.  We're an hour into the show, and now one lady has showed up today.  Come on, Goyles.  Help us out.  Come on, gals.  Come on, James.  What are you afraid of?  Let's go to the F.U. line.  Hey, thanks for calling, and here's the Opie and Anthony F.U. line.  I want to give a big, fat F.U. to all you stupid-ass Philly fans out there who's such 
[00:53:30]  wannabe New Yorkers, it's ridiculous.  You guys suck.  Your freaking team stepped in some F.U. and you got lucky and made it to the playoffs.  So what?  You got to get your asses kicked by St. Louis.  You guys suck.  Bye, Philly Beagles.  Next message.  I like to give a big F.U. to my ex-girlfriend who came back into my life after four years,  played with my emotions for the last two months, telling me that she loved me again,  and now just broke up with me for white trash, I-need-a-kidney boyfriend. 
[00:54:00]  Kelly, F.U. you, bitch.  Next message.  F.U. Mike, for saying tangs all the time.  I'm sick of the term tang.  Shut up, Mike.  Next message.  This is West Coast Dave, and I want to send a big F.U. out to the New York Islanders,  talking all that trash, and losing five to four.  F.U.  Ah.  End of message.  Whip them out Wednesday. 
[00:54:30]  Oh, man.  One bad score.  Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  I love that.  And he...  Yeah, you're checking out the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Colin Quinn in studio.  Playing Carolines here in New York City Thursday through Sunday.  Yeah.  Wow, look at you with all those dates there.  Oh, yeah.  I didn't know what to say. 
[00:55:00]  Me neither.  It's a portable phone.  It's not a big phone.  It's a portable phone.  And the promos on the TV, they show the little wacky dance they do.  Oh, stop with that.  It's never funny.  Every goddamn network does it.  Stop showing your cast doing a little wacky dance.  How about funny dialogue, you politically correct scumbags?  How about promos with funny dialogue?  You're fat.  I hope you get cancer.  Ah, that would make me laugh. 
[00:55:30]  That's what they do.  They replace good, ballsy dialogue with little wacky dances.  Wacky dances.  And they wonder why people are going to cable.  It sucks.  It's true.  Wow.  That's good dialogue with the portable phone thing.  Oh, that's funny.  I can't even hear it.  It's a portable phone.  Just like we were in the 80s.  Yeah, I know.  How about why is he losing weight?  What's that virus?  That's what happened in the 80s.  James Brady is paralyzed. 
[00:56:00]  Bernhardt gets shot a bunch of what?  Oh, my God.  Mr. Reagan.  Mr. Reagan.  Yo, man.  Give me five bucks.  You don't look so bad.  Let's go to Crown Heights.  Come on.  The fun of the 80s. 
[00:56:30]  I'm out of 80s stuff.  God, do I suck.  Well, I'm sure they'll cover all that during the 80s show.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  A little funny, you know.  Religious Relations.  El Salvador.  Ah, hey.  That's close.  Rock Hudson was a what?  Hey, wow.  The challenger.  Uh-oh. 
[00:57:00]  Don't have funny dialogue.  Just show a little wacky dance with your cast.  You know.  Let's tune into that, hon.  It stinks.  You ever notice that in the 80s, I don't think we commented as much on 80s stuff as they seem to in this?  It's like, hey, nice Pat Benatar headband.  Like, no, it was just accepted because that's what it was.  They're looking at it like you look now in hindsight.  It's a portable phone. 
[00:57:30]  No, you just kind of had it.  That was a nice spiky hairdo, punk girl.  All right.  There you go.  How about that Michael Jackson jacket?  Well, no one said that because back then it was just called a jacket.  Back then it was kind of accepted.  Members only jacket.  That was just a jacket.  Well, you'd just say, hey, how come you're dressed like that black fag?  That's what you would say. 
[00:58:00]  You know, you didn't necessarily have to explain it.  Right.  But again, retards write it and retards watch it, and that's why it has to be over-explained.  Garbage.  And I never saw that show, in all fairness.  There you go.  So I can't really comment.  It might be a funny show.  I'm just going with the promos and all of them.  I don't know.  Every sitcom.  Hey, Ralphie.  Yo, what's up?  What's going on?  Dude, I was just pulled into a parking lot of a diner on Glencoe Road.  Yeah.  And Robert Deo just walked inside the diner.  Him and two other guys.  Oh, yeah.  Want me to go screw around with him? 
[00:58:30]  Here goes.  Here's a wacky bit alert.  I swear.  I'm not even kidding, man.  He just walked inside of a diner.  All right.  Why don't you...  He lives around here.  All right.  Why don't you go into the diner and we'll talk to Robert De Niro?  He doesn't live...  No, dude.  I'm not even kidding.  He doesn't...  He's in Manhattan.  Wait.  Hold on.  What are you?  He's got a house upstate.  Where are you?  Yeah.  He lives by the Mineola train station, jackass.  Where are you?  Mineola train station.  You only thought you lived in Brookville.  I know where you live.  All right.  What are you going to do then?  All right.  All right.  What are you going to do then? 
[00:59:00]  All right.  All right.  All right.  It's Rupert Pumpkin.  You guys are nuts.  I wanted to hear the impression.  I knew it.  We knew it was like...  Of course.  We knew it was joshing.  And then you could see him on the phone all sweating.  All right.  Yeah.  De Niro's here.  Don't forget me.  I'll get my big thing.  I'll be able to bash him.  Yeah.  He's right here.  No, you jerk.  You suck.  And the sad thing is he really drove to Glencoe Road so it would be realistic to him.  So the background noise is the same.  We might be tipped off.  ONA.  Colin Quinn of Caroline's. 
[00:59:30]  Yes, Andy.  Got a big problem with the show.  All right.  It's going downhill.  Can I explain to you why?  Uh-huh.  All right.  I like the show.  It keeps me out of real rage.  A lot of guys are local 802.  We listen to you guys all the time.  Okay.  I got to hear Colin Quinn.  I met him one time.  Pop his ass, first of all.  I don't know what he's promoting.  Soap?  I mean, what's he doing on the show?  Jim Norton's a funny guy.  But if I got to hear a thousand times the same old freaking lines over, I'm going to kill somebody.  What's your problem with Colin Quinn? 
[01:00:00]  I don't know what he's famous for.  I met him one time.  And I asked him for an autograph and he gave me an attitude.  You're a lion.  I'm a moron.  Talk about your sister like that.  I got it right here.  Turn up your sister.  I'll punch you in the face, you queer.  Oh, my God.  Another lion.  I'll spit it right in your face, you stupid ass.  I never turned anyone down for an autograph, you moron.  I never turned anybody down for an autograph, you idiot.  No wonder why they kicked you out of Saturday Night Live.  Hey, what did you do before Saturday Night Live?  They should kick you out of Local 802, you quiff. 
[01:00:30]  What did you do before Saturday Night Live?  You quiff.  Stupid.  What did you do before Saturday Night Live?  All right, wait.  When did he turn anybody down for an autograph?  Yeah, when did you do before Saturday Night Live?  Hold on, Andy.  Andy, when did he turn you down?  Like two years ago, I got a chance to go to SNL.  Yeah.  I got in there.  Somebody I can't say got me in the back.  I asked him for an autograph.  He was with like two other people.  All he gave me was a dirty looking autograph.  You're lying.  I'm lying?  You're lying.  Let me ask a question.  I never turned anyone down for an autograph, stupid.  Let me tell you something about Colin Quinn.  In my whole life, you stupid guys off air that I've ever met. 
[01:01:00]  Off air?  What is he famous for on air?  Go to Caroline's and you tell me what he's famous for.  Caroline's?  Come on, the workers aren't even going to show up.  Get out of your mind.  The place will be packed.  I never turned anyone down for an autograph.  I'm hanging up on Andy.  Andy's a great judge.  He's lying.  That's good, bad.  But he's lying because I'm telling you I've never turned anyone down for an autograph in my whole life.  And to say that Colin's not funny, I'll agree that he's a pompous ass.  But to say that he's not funny is ridiculous.  I like how he had his little story, too. 
[01:01:30]  I was in SNL.  Not in the audience.  He's like, you know, I was back there.  Somebody I knew I can't mention.  And he's lying.  That's what's making me mad.  Two years ago.  I never turned anyone down for an autograph.  Two years ago, ten years ago.  Colin probably walked by and the guy probably went, could you?  And he didn't hear him and kept going.  No, he's a dumb guy.  He probably called me over like, hey, hey, hey.  Yeah, yeah.  Hey, hey.  I mean, he went over like his waiter, so now he decided.  You're quip.  You're quip.  That was good.  John, what's up?  Now you have to punch his sister in the face. 
[01:02:00]  Hey, John, what's up?  I want to see that.  You bitch.  Colin, stop it in his sister's face.  Hey, John, you're next.  What's up?  Listen, on that 80s show they're showing, if they're saying it's during the Reagan era,  the first portable phones that people had, don't you remember?  They were like little, like, in like small boxes.  There was like a...  It was like you're carrying around a colostomy bag with you, those old phones.  That's an inaccuracy on those people.  Wow.  Well, that's it.  I won't watch. 
[01:02:30]  They're not accurate with their cell phone technology.  But I would always tell.  They're going to make a movie.  It's a portable phone.  All right.  Take care, guys.  Norton rules.  Thank you, mister.  Boy, I thought Colin's tirade was a lot like Tyson's yesterday.  Yeah, faggot.  I'll F you until you love me.  Come on.  I'll eat your hole.  I can't help it.  He was lying.  You can't survive in my f***ing world. 
[01:03:00]  I'm going to call up the business agent from 802 and get him doors.  Do it all.  You don't know how to handle a real man.  Tyson growling.  You see that yesterday?  Yeah.  Tyson growled.  I'm a real man.  There at his teeth started pounding his chest with his fists.  Tyson needs like a beating from like a small white guy. 
[01:03:30]  You think so?  I don't know if I see that.  Yeah, where's that happening?  What bizarro planet is that going to happen on?  You never know.  I don't see that ever happening.  That guy is frightening.  And whoever, people saying it's Russ Salisbury that he was yelling at yesterday,  you can just check by yesterday's underwear.  That has to just look like a shoeshine rag.  After Tyson was feet away from him,  telling him he's going to F him until he loves him.  That's like dialogue from Oz. 
[01:04:00]  That's not what you could hear at a goddamn press conference.  But it was oddly sexy, though, because it's not gay if it's Tyson,  because he's holding you down.  You're like, get off.  No, I'm all right.  You would know it hit you.  You ever see that clip?  Not many people have seen it, but for the people that did,  it was a talk show, I believe, in England,  and they had some woman sitting in a chair,  and there was a trained bear sitting next to the woman.  The woman's smiling and talking.  The bear out of nowhere is sitting there like Yogi, 
[01:04:30]  all, hey, where are the picnic baskets?  Within a split second, it had the woman in its claws  and was beating her against the floor.  That is what Tyson reminds me of.  Like, it would be like that.  You would just go, oh, yeah, you've got a problem with...  There's a man in me.  That's it.  Time.  Like a rodeo.  Done.  You're over.  Caroline, what's up?  Brightening man.  Hey, I have a question for that guy, Andy. 
[01:05:00]  If he's still listening,  if he doesn't know what Colin's famous for,  why does he want his autograph?  Oh.  That's a good one.  The guy was saying, what have you done?  He's not good, but he wanted your autograph.  What did he do before SNL?  One of the best game shows ever.  Remote control.  Remote control.  Can over.  And do you win LA Gear Sneaking?  Wait, he's not going to go through the problem.  That was great.  No, the sad pose, I used to wear LA Gear Sneaking since it was free. 
[01:05:30]  It's going to be part of the 80s show.  Part of the 80s show.  I'm watching remote control.  You're right, it is.  Look, it's Colin Quinn.  There you go.  A very popular part of 80s pop culture.  The sad part is when I do like a guest spot on the show  as some cop who's in there,  and meanwhile they're watching remote control.  Oh, is that it?  It'll be like a wink to the audience.  Look, they're watching it. 
[01:06:00]  He's on TV, but there he is.  Hey, it's Howard Beast.  They have a flat.  Hey, look at him run.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  John, what's going on?  Johnny, what's up?  What's up, man?  Hello.  Hello, you're on the air.  John.  Yeah, how you doing?  I'm wondering if that 80s show is going to touch on that 
[01:06:30]  oh-so-funny topic of the Tawana Brawley incident.  Tawana Brawley was abducted,  put in a garbage bag with feces on her.  There's a log on my chest.  Why are you changing my bits?  Just leave it where it is.  I thought that Tom Brookhaugh would have to make an appearance.  NBC Nightly News.  Ben's freestyling.  He is.  He's trying to be Fatboy Slim over there.  I was very happy with what you had picked out for me.  Joe, what's going on? 
[01:07:00]  Hey, if they want real lines from the 80s that are funny,  how about, hey man, my family's from Chernobyl.  Ho, ho, ho!  Hey, who promoted the Tyson thing?  I don't know.  It's probably Kings involved, sure.  You know, if it was Miss McMahon,  you know what would have happened to him, don't you?  What?  You're fired!  Very good.  Gentlemen, have a good day.  It's almost like Rick calling it with that joke yesterday.  Shut up!  Do we have that isolated?  No, we need that joke. 
[01:07:30]  We will.  We need that joke.  We need that joke real bad.  Rick told one that just laid there yesterday.  If you had to put them together and said,  well, it's so cramped in here,  Steve and I are expecting a portable phone!  Ho, ho, ho!  Awful.  Awful joke.  Yeah, Rick went to Stalker Patty's crib yesterday, Colin.  Really?  Yeah, we did a segment yesterday called Cribs with Stalker Patty.  You know, I wasn't there.  She was still alive when you got there?  Unfortunately. 
[01:08:00]  She lives in...  They're saying, here's her room.  It's off the kitchen, and it's got that sliding accordion door.  It's like, she lives in a pantry.  If it's off the kitchen and has an accordion door, it's a pantry.  And they were saying it was six by ten.  Yeah.  Six feet across, ten feet long?  I picture her room looking like the Chelsea Hotel when they found Sid Vicious' body.  Awful.  And you guys, you know, I wasn't there. 
[01:08:30]  So, all I can say is, from the description you gave me when you came back,  you and Steve kind of pussied out a bit.  I'm sorry.  I gotta say.  Dude, I don't care.  Did you hear any of this, though?  Yeah, I mean, Rick usually does a good job, but you guys seemed a little...  They were intimidated by the family.  A little reserved, I think.  There was a lot to describe outside the little room that she kept.  What about the mongoloid banging on the window?  Yeah.  I wish we could have gone into that.  You guys didn't even discuss there was a Down Syndrome child banging on the window. 
[01:09:00]  Of Patty's crew?  Yes.  And they didn't tape it or nothing?  Kept in another room.  We didn't actually see it.  Hello?  Kept in another room?  Kept in another room.  There was another foundling?  Wow.  Could be.  I don't know.  Was it a Kennedy?  What the F?  We wasted 20 minutes with that bit yesterday, and you had a Down Syndrome kid banging on  a window, and we couldn't talk about it?  So, we were being watched by a group of day strippers, okay?  That's what they looked like.  No, they were foundlings.  We're calling them the foundlings. 
[01:09:30]  Whatever.  It was an uncomfortable...  Patty lives in this house with how many other women?  Six.  Six to ten.  Six to ten.  Six to ten.  Now, the only description we got yesterday, it was a mother and her daughters and Patty  that lived there.  Well...  Is it a boarding house?  It's a battered women's shelter.  That's what we think.  That's initially what we thought, but we got there, and we were introduced to the head  of the household as the mother, and then all of a sudden, they started referring to  each other as sisters.  Like a cult. 
[01:10:00]  Right.  It was very strange, and then one of them walks into the room...  Were they all wearing Nike sneakers?  Waiting for the spaceship behind the comics.  Is it a strange, dilapidated brothel where she just kind of sat at the head table and  just kind of watched everything?  Like a madam?  Is it a madam?  Yeah.  She could have been.  She was referred to as the mother of the house.  The mother.  Oh.  Something's going on there.  And Patty lives there, and there's ten other women that live there.  Yeah.  And what's up with the Down Syndrome kid?  We didn't see him.  I did.  That's the only way you saw him? 
[01:10:30]  Oh, you saw him?  They needed that one so that Lifetime would buy it as the movie of the week.  You got to add that in.  I don't know what the story is.  A Lifetime movie exclusive.  Ten women.  Starring Markie Post.  In a movie a man would never watch.  When we were walking up...  Unless he was gay.  When we were walking up to the house, Patty told us specifically not to mention or videotape  this Down Syndrome kid that was supposedly living there. 
[01:11:00]  The first thing we saw when we got to the house was this Down Syndrome kid banging on  the window, laughing at us.  How do you not tape that?  I did tape it.  Oh, give me the goddamn tape.  Do we have a...  We can see the tape right now of that?  I'll run into my studio and queue it up.  I absolutely got to see the Down Syndrome child banging on the window.  Yeah.  I don't know why.  I got to see that.  I was there, but when you walk into a place...  I mean, mind you, we were afraid of getting shot while we were standing outside.  I thought it was a really bad neighborhood.  It was a really bad neighborhood.  We had warnings coming in from our listeners going, dude, get those guys out of there. 
[01:11:30]  I know where she lives.  It's bad.  I heard the Down Syndrome kid was pissed because Colin wouldn't give him an autograph.  You had drive-bys, drive-bys?  Is that what happened?  I saw he was banging.  There was a...  Called him a pompous...  He tried to say pompous, but the big tongue got him away.  They had...  Pompous ass.  Pompous ass.  They had guys driving by the house.  Yeah.  And slowing down and stuff.  Yeah.  We were sitting out waiting for you guys to come out of spots, and there were guys driving  by the house, and like a white Thunderbird, just black guys eyeballing us.  Right.  And we didn't know...  Hello, my brother. 
[01:12:00]  How did you guys find your house?  Got in the house.  He's quickly sponsored.  Hello, my brother.  Hello, my brother.  Yo, man.  Hey, Love Productions.  That's another 80s reference.  Isn't that great?  For Jimmy's show.  I'm playing, Hey, Love Productions' album.  No, my brother.  You've got to buy your own portable phone.  Hey, guys.  It's cool, Herc.  But like the guy that drove by, which was kind of scary, the one that we saw up close,  he's driving, and he's like... 
[01:12:30]  It's almost like he's not even steering the car, because he's looking at us.  Well, that's...  Yeah.  It was just like, whoa.  That's when we went right into the house.  Because he got the videotape.  Might be getting some heavy dents.  Neat.  Yeah.  Turn that gun sideways and start buck, buck.  It's a gat.  There was the lunatic guy with the three plastic shop, the three hefty sacks filled with something  that he wanted to sell us.  I don't know what that was, but he was walking up and down the street with just... 
[01:13:00]  Creamy garbage bags.  You don't know what was in him?  We don't know.  Did you tape him?  Yeah.  Got him.  Yeah.  That video clip is up on the website right now, actually.  And it was just...  There was so much.  There was the busted basketball hoop in front that looked like something out of a Freddy  Krueger movie.  There was...  Nice.  Just...  It was a very ominous neighborhood, and it wasn't the kind of place where Rick and I  wanted to start pissing off the people in the house...  Right.  ...just in case they felt like shooting us or something.  Or kicking you out into the jungle.  Kicking us out into the place where we might get shot.  So...  Well, where's the genetic disaster banging on the window? 
[01:13:30]  Yeah.  We'll take a break.  You've got to cue that up so we can check it out.  Oh.  And we haven't even told Colin Quinn what we learned about Stalker Patty yesterday.  I guess we could do it real fast before...  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  It's great.  Turns out Stalker Patty's dad was a stockbroker that was married uptown with a family.  Uh-huh.  And he was banging this burlesque dancer.  Stripper.  She got pregnant.  Hence, Stalker Patty.  That's who Stalker Patty is.  The mom couldn't handle it.  And back then, abortion was a big-time no-no. 
[01:14:00]  After nine months, she goes to a restaurant.  Diner.  Has a little something to eat downtown.  Leaves Patty in a wicker basket...  On the counter.  ...on the counter and leaves.  Whoa.  Says, find her father.  Gives her number to the father.  They call up the police and take Patty away.  The father wants no part of her.  So, she's putting it...  Put in, as she said, a foundling house.  I'm like, what is this?  Little house on the prairie?  Oh.  It's in Mankato. 
[01:14:30]  We're taking Patty to Sleepy Eye to the foundling house.  Where's Pa?  Mary's at the blind school.  The father's like the big corporate guy.  Yeah, he wanted to know part of that.  The guy from, like, cut down on sugar.  I don't have time to cut down on sugar.  Way back in the 50s, you know?  You just picture the dad walking around Wall Street.  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  That Clark Kent hat on.  Yeah.  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  I ain't got time for that.  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  Oh, you're right.  Manhattan, big iron beams going on. 
[01:15:00]  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, building it up.  The 50s.  But his mother goes to church every year and just, like, says confession.  Right.  Those old scary 50s churches, all in black and white.  My son has a terrible secret.  Forgive my son.  I will light the candle.  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  Buy, sell, sell.  You know, Patty and Vaughn should have a sitcom called Justifiably Low Self-Esteem.  I know the struggle.  Peter has more info on the house that Patty lives in. 
[01:15:30]  Peter?  There is a house where the federal government or the state puts people in.  They put families in.  They have a husband and a wife.  And they take care of retarded, slightly retarded people.  And it's federally funded.  Oh, there you go.  They live there as the mom and dad.  They get free room and board because the federal government pays it.  They get all free groceries.  So it costs them nothing.  A lot of times there's a couple that works two different jobs.  They've got to be there for 16 hours a day. 
[01:16:00]  So the husband, what, 25 hours a day.  The husband works a 12-hour job.  He leaves as a custodian.  And the wife's there.  And then they vice versa.  There's always an adult.  So there's some money getting pulled in because they're packing their houses with tards.  Tards!  Well, no, no.  But the federal government sets this up so that they get paid.  And the tards live there.  And it's a setup.  I mean, that's what they would have pulled down to.  Oh, shit.  I know the guy who did it.  Because they're called functional.  Highly functional.  They can go out and work.  But maybe they can't keep houses like Patty.  She's always getting thrown out of her apartments. 
[01:16:30]  They have the meals made for them there by these people.  That's what it's there for.  But it's all funded.  So the people that live there live rent-free, board-free, everything free.  And they get money on top of that.  Rick, did the girls look a little off?  Like slightly off?  Oh, yeah.  Did they look slightly off?  Yeah.  Yeah?  I mean, Patty had the best teeth in the house.  Oh, wow.  To give you an idea.  Who cares about the teeth?  What about the eyes?  A little crazy?  A little cross-eyed?  Well, you always heard the one poking in like, oh, did you say this?  And then, like, she'd back off again a bit.  And we finally had to close the little sliding door. 
[01:17:00]  Anybody living under the stairs at that house?  We didn't want to look.  That's a great setup, though.  You get paid all the sex you could possibly want.  Just think about that.  Hey, you're a horny guy.  How hard could it be?  Yeah.  I got candy.  It's a crayon.  Oh, my God.  Norton, what are you filling out the application for this gig?  Oh, it's beautiful, man.  Snickers bar, you're diddling away.  That's all it takes.  Thank you, Peter.  I love the show.  And Norton, you are the best.  I'm what? 
[01:17:30]  The best.  Oh, thank you, buddy.  I think you called me a fat.  Hey, you know, the defense attorney will pull them apart in court if they try to testify  against you.  Yeah.  Do you know what two plus two is, sir?  Then how could you possibly know what this man did to you?  Look at that.  Just thinking about it.  Look at that.  Oh, God.  Norton.  Don't show me.  He's always pointing to his pants.  Like a ballpark frank in there.  All right.  It's the bitches that'll get you. 
[01:18:00]  The bitches that'll get you.  Neil Diamond, featured in the next segment.  Another poor son of a bitch.  Yeah.  And remind me about Girls Gone Wild.  Ah.  Wow, a naked girl is highly immoral.  Whip about Wednesday.  The greatest promotion in radio history.  Get a wow sticker and get in on it.  Go to opiananthony.com for details.  And E-W.  We're back with the O.P. and Anthony show. 
[01:18:30]  Thanks for checking us out today on this fine Whip-Em-Out Wednesday.  It doesn't matter what the weather is outside.  It's always a fine Whip-Em-Out Wednesday.  Right.  Ladies, if you see wow in the back of someone's car, that means they're hoping to see something  on the way home from work today.  So if you feel like it, show them your boobies there.  A couple phone numbers in the New York area.  877-692-1027.  Anywhere else.  866-2774.  Wow.  As we patiently wait for the first girl to show up for the Naughty Nighty contest today. 
[01:19:00]  Come on, ladies.  We're waiting.  And waiting.  And waiting.  And waiting.  The cities are just battling it out, Anthony.  Cleveland is like...  Cleveland's like, why is a crack whore representing Cleveland in the Naughty Nighty contest?  What?  That's one guy's opinion.  I think the representation from Cleveland, the first one we got so far, it's quite lovely. 
[01:19:30]  I like that.  He's got like the Naughty Nurse Nighty thing happening.  Yeah.  You look sick.  How about a little popcorn-y flavor tingle, young man?  But Cleveland getting pissed off.  They're like, this is all we got in Cleveland to represent the Opie and Anthony show?  And then this guy from Buffalo writes, you guys are in trouble if you're looking for a  hot chick from Buffalo to enter the Naughty Nighty contest.  We have the dirty sluts, but not the good-looking ones.  If you wanted fat, slutty, chain-smoking, dirty whores in the 90s, Buffalo would win that 
[01:20:00]  contest for sure.  You guys suck.  Love the show.  We'll have to wait and see what Buffalo gives us for this contest.  What?  What's that, Norton?  I had a call before on my cellular phone!  Huggler, huggler.  Those wacky 80s.  I'm sure all those references will be there.  Oh, my God.  John Lennon was shot! 
[01:20:30]  And Anthony over Lockerbie!  Oh, jeez.  It was the 80s.  You got to make all the 80s references.  Yeah.  That's a good song.  Randy Rhoads killed in a plane crash.  What a great show that'll be. 
[01:21:00]  Oh, hey, where's Ivan Boski?  He was convicted of insider trading!  Hey!  Start of the crack epidemic!  That'll do a wacky dance.  Yeah, you know, that little...  And it's funny, the dance they do looks like Walk Like an Egyptian! 
[01:21:30]  Oh!  From the 80s!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  I'm sure they'll talk about, uh...  You know, who...  I'm getting my friends over to talk about who shot J.R.  Yeah, that's...  We got to talk about that.  Ooh, who shot J.R.?  I'm calling for my portable phone!  Stinky! 
[01:22:00]  Yeah, dry stinky nuts today.  Just say that over and over again.  That every time...  Stinky, I'm calling for my portable phone!  I'm sure he's saying thank you right now.  Of course he is.  Ah, very good.  Well, I'm watching.  You're going to...  Stalker Patty wants to clear the air here.  Yay!  Yeah, I just have to just make it known that the New York Browns and Wayne Hospital is a place in Manhattan that has nothing to do with where I live now. 
[01:22:30]  You know that!  Okay, and then the family that lives there, well, the girl that was, you know, that you...  We two talked a lot, you know, while we were there.  She lives upstairs with her husband and four kids.  And then her sister and brother are in rooms above, on the third level of the house.  And then...  Patty?  Yeah?  Get a grip on yourself, you big-gummed idiot.  Oh, God!  Oh, stop!  No, I'm just trying to set it straight.  Okay?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah. 
[01:23:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, she lives there.  Yeah.  Hey, Anthony!  Jesus.  Whoa, what happened?  What's wrong, Jim?  Jim, I appreciate your brutality.  Aw, he's an awful man.  I used to hang up on people in the 80s.  It's no big deal.  Yeah, but it would just be a little...  A little button push.  That's funny on a radio where no one can see what my hands are doing.  God, do I sink, tank.  Start with Patty.  Hi.  Why'd you hang up on me? 
[01:23:30]  I was just trying to explain.  You know, but anyway, Karen from the Resisting Arrest show, that's our niece.  It's just...  There you go.  She sounded like Glenn Close there.  Because I don't know if you guys are knowing, but they're doing something new now called That 50th Show.  Oh, no, look, it's a baby in a diner!  Oh, no, silly alert. 
[01:24:00]  The show is heading towards silly, though.  Oh, no.  It's going to be the Carol Burnett show all over again.  We can't control ourselves.  Yeah, just making eye contact and laughing.  Oh, it's that 80s show, that 1280s show.  It's the plague!  The, the, the, the plague!  You sure it's not the 1880s? 
[01:24:30]  He freed the slaves and now we find out it's a bitch?  Nice callback.  Wow.  Yump and Yimini.  Brian, people want in on this now.  Brian.  No, I don't have the flu.  I've got a new disease called HIV. 
[01:25:00]  And it's a ground ball to Buckner.  Behind the back!  Slow roller, down the first baseline.  It's behind the back!  We're trying to play nice with Boston today.  Ah, you know, they've got to appreciate that 80s whole thing going on there.  Scott Pharrell ripped them a new one last night. 
[01:25:30]  Nostalgia coming back?  Mm-hmm.  Oh, God.  Doug from Springfield.  I just saw this new comic, Rich Frost's The 80s Show, and his stuff is all new and funny.  And the Alleners win the Stanley Cup!  The Alleners win the Stanley Cup!  Well, they did.  The drive for five!  They did.  The drive for five!  Into a ditch!  He's obsessed with that.  I own the range of you today.  I'm sure the cast of the 80s shows are going to sit around and watch Alf. 
[01:26:00]  Alf!  Oh, that Alf!  That Webster!  Oh, that Alf was really funny.  Oh, what a funny show.  Little hairy fella in a bag.  You think some of them will walk in wearing, like, a Crockett and Tubbs attire from Miami Vice?  Look, I'm not wearing socks with my shoes!  I'm wearing a neon blue T-shirt under my blazer! 
[01:26:30]  And you've got a five o'clock shadow!  And we're commenting on it!  And we're commenting on it!  Because it's the 80s!  That's what we did!  Why don't we put on Capizio's and dance on to the new Michael Jackson record?  Hey, did you hear the new Kaja Goo Goo?  Too Shy Shog. 
[01:27:00]  I get Dan from Hoboken, that 20s show.  No, I'm not in your kitchen, it's a phone.  Oh, damn, damn.  Hey, Dan, welcome back to the show.  Dan, welcome back.  Welcome back.  That's what he said. 
[01:27:30]  Watson, come quick, I need you.  Nice build acid on my hand.  I invented a phone.  No, I'm not looking at Jim Norton.  I'm at eatabullet.com.  Oh, God, he gets a plug in.  Ugh, awful.  Disgust me. 
[01:28:00]  Where'd you get those old pants?  No, these are stonewashed jeans.  Stonewashed jeans.  I just can't wait till that 90s show.  Hey, why are Eric and Dylan shooting everyone?  Oh, God.  Wow.  There you go. 
[01:28:30]  Patty gets done on that foundling show.  Hey, I'm wearing a Rick Springfield tie.  Mike, what's going on?  I just want to tell you, no, it's not a plane.  It's a space shuttle that just blew up.  1780 show. 
[01:29:00]  I'm not paying that much for no...  Holy ass.  I don't care how good a worker he is.  Thank you, Captain Obvious.  No.  One of them will pull up in a DeLorean.  It's stainless steel! 
[01:29:30]  Ernie from Jersey.  Hey, I'm calling for my portable phone while driving this bit into the ground!  You dick.  He's right.  That happened.  And then Jeff from Union.  Can we please put the portable phone guy in a washing machine with Magic Johnson and  a thousand razor blades?  Oh, nice.  All right.  There you go.  Well, we had a nice parachute pants joke coming, but all right, we'll move on.  Parachute pants.  I'd like to hear it. 
[01:30:00]  Remember that?  Okay, Anthony.  Girls Gone Wild.  This will be short and sweet, okay?  I'm going to do the company of Girls Gone Wild a huge favor today.  Yeah.  We've all seen the commercials, right?  Uh-huh.  Of girls going wild and showing their boobies and they kind of...  All right.  All right, Jesus.  From that zero show.  Yeah, I know.  I saw it.  Go ahead.  No, it's not a tree. 
[01:30:30]  It's Christ on a cross.  Officially went too far, right?  No.  They make fun like that.  Hey, man, now you're messing with my religion.  That wasn't fun.  I know.  See, now it hit home.  Yeah, but not five past five.  Whew.  Girls Gone Wild.  See RoboCop?  Yeah.  Girls showing their boobies.  We've all seen the commercial.  Okay.  They just...  Girls Gone Wild.  They sent us a copy of Girls Gone Wild on campus. 
[01:31:00]  On campus.  All real, uncensored, raw, real, uncut.  Where's Jeff Spicoli?  Is he still on campus?  Wild, hot, out of control, sexy co-eds.  Yeah.  Think you've seen it all before?  Think again, because now Girls Gone Wild takes you east coast, west coast, north and south  to the top party schools across the USA.  Say, this is something that the fine people at Girls Gone Wild don't tell you with their  TV spots late at night?  Yeah, because I was under the impression that it was a bunch of flashing, a bunch of girls 
[01:31:30]  flashing their boobs, which is cool.  You know?  The Girls Gone Wild on campus tape shows lots and lots of clam!  No, clam!  Clam!  Right.  They failed to mention that.  That should be the selling point of this.  Somehow, they should tell you that in their spot.  Somehow.  We were watching it in the back in the office.  And a cryptic message if they have to.  Have clams like snapping animated clams all over the screen during the commercial. 
[01:32:00]  I mean, I'm sure they sell a lot of tapes, but you want to sell an S-load of tape?  Make sure people know that they show clam.  Clam.  Thank you.  We were watching in the office, and there's girls.  It's at spring break, and Mardi Gras and one of them.  And with very short skirts, and the cameras get right under their skirts, and they're  not wearing panties, these girls.  Or they're pulling their skirts up, bending over, and you're just seeing the whole shot. 
[01:32:30]  A whole meaty mess.  They show the cheeks, too?  Everything.  Everything.  We were stunned.  Girls are sitting on a park bench with a skirt on.  Some girl's suing that company, by the way.  Suing.  I was naked, and you taped me.  Yeah, I was sucking it at Mardi Gras, but you taped me.  And now she's trying to sue, but their attorneys are like, good luck.  If you're showing stuff in public, especially in an event where there's a lot of cameras, 
[01:33:00]  like Mardi Gras and things like that, fair game.  You're S out of luck.  You want to show those greasy meat curtains?  Oh, did I really show meaty packages?  Meaty.  I'm talking sirloin.  Pack of franks?  Yeah.  Take two franks, right?  Put them together.  You know what that looks like?  Oh, yes.  Now, slightly bend them a little bit so they're just little convex.  And now shove some roast beef between the two. 
[01:33:30]  Okay?  Now drop it on a barbershop floor.  There you go.  Wow.  Nice, I know.  Yeah, well.  Hey, is this true?  Yeah.  What?  But, someone's got to confirm this.  Kevin from the Upper East Side.  Dad from ALF.  Gay crackhead story.  Holy F.  This is true?  That's true.  That's true.  The father from ALF was caught smoking crack pipes and sucking last year. 
[01:34:00]  It was a huge story.  Wow.  What was his name, the guy?  I don't know.  ALF star caught in crack house.  Yeah, it's videotaped, huh?  What?  They've got, like, little clips, still pictures.  Of him giving a Hummer?  Of him, like, burning up a crack pipe.  Mild-mannered, ALF star, Max, Max Wright.  Holy S.  Is that girl here for the Naughty Nighty contest? 
[01:34:30]  Yep.  Sorry.  Holy.  That's okay.  I think we have our first stripper, ladies and gentlemen.  Look at Norton just leaves gym.  Any good?  Yeah.  Good?  Yeah.  Good.  Oh, God, Norton.  You're tugging it.  Good?  He's tugging at it.  She was here the other day.  Solid.  Who's the other?  A pretty blonde girl who was half British.  Oh, she's back?  Uh-huh.  Cool.  All right.  What did I have on that one?  She's going to officially enter the Naughty Nighty contest in just a few minutes here. 
[01:35:00]  Anything else in that end?  I'm sorry.  No, just that he was.  Yeah, he was in a crack house.  They got pictures of him toking up on a crack pipe.  And he was sucking on mule for crack.  Yo, man, I will suck yo.  What movie was that?  It might have been Jungle Fever.  New Jack City.  Oh.  Not New Jack City.  Jungle Fever.  Oh, man.  All right.  Well, we'll talk to the fine lady that's going to join the Naughty Nighty contest.  Yes.  Also, we're going to take a break, and I'm sure there's going to be a commercial for that 80s show, 
[01:35:30]  and you're just going to be giggling.  Yeah, wait.  Let me put on my laughing hat.  Ha, ha, that's a funny hat.  Now when you hear the spot, you're going to be laughing because of all the fun humor we just gave you.  Right.  See how that works?  Awful.  Yeah, we can check out the F.U. line.  It seems pretty busy today.  Hey, thanks for calling, and here's the O.P. Anthony F.U. line.  This is for that bitch who thinks we're treating the Al-Qaeda members inhumanely.  You know what inhumane is, bitch? 
[01:36:00]  Dropping millions of pounds of concrete on my cousin's head.  That's f***ing inhumane.  Inhumane is doing what you did to us, you cowardly bastards.  Inhumane is how I would treat you if I got one of you face-to-face.  F*** you, you people, if you're sorry for them bastards.  Go F yourself.  Next message.  Yeah, this is Lenny from Marstown.  I want to give an Alpha Omega.  He can't take F.U. to my ex-girlfriend for F-ing me over and an F.U. to myself for putting up with it. 
[01:36:30]  Biot.  Next message.  Yeah, I want to send a big F.U. to Rangers General Manager, Glenn Sater.  I want to know why the hell Ron Lowe is still running the team.  F.U.  End of message.  You have 30 seconds to well leave.  Whip on mouth.  Whip on mouth.  Whip on mouth.  Check this out.  I got boobs to show you.  Wow.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:37:00]  And E.W.  A hot blonde just walked out of the bathroom in her naughty nighty Anthony.  Naughty nighty.  We're taking her pictures.  They'll be up on opieandanthony.com.  So far, only one girl showing up today.  Not good.  No, we need more girls.  We have a trip for two to Hedonism 3 for the eventual winner.  And cold, hard cash for second and third place.  A lot of the cities we broadcast to are in on the naughty nighty contest. 
[01:37:30]  Go to opieandanthony.com for all the details.  Billy, what's going on?  Hey, what's happening?  Hey, man.  How are you?  Good.  We're talking to you.  Yeah, well, I produced the show.  The 80s show.  You guys busted on it already? 
[01:38:00]  You're not the producer of the 80s show.  Oh, yeah, I am.  Yeah.  Where are you calling from?  Philly.  I'm actually out here right now.  Yeah.  Why were there all the hot shows or films?  No offense to Philly, but we don't think TV producers when we think Philly.  Right.  Well, I moved out to L.A., you know, but I'm back in Philly checking it out, and I heard  you guys talking about my show, and I just wanted to tell you it's going to be all that.  All that. 
[01:38:30]  All that.  And a bag of chips.  Hey, dude, what's the address of the Fox lot in Los Angeles?  Quickly.  Oh, um, East.  You're lying.  You guys got me.  And you know what's funny?  You're cool, baby.  I didn't know the address either.  I have no idea.  If you were quick, you would have gotten it.  I might have believed you.  Hey, Joe, what's going on?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, that Girls Gone Wild video, at the end of it, they have, like, a bunch of hardcore 
[01:39:00]  porn on there, too.  It's not like just showing some T&A, you know?  What do you mean?  They have, like, hardcore porn.  Like effing?  Like mad effing, like huge.  Yeah, a bunch of people are calling and saying that's what's happening at the end of these  days.  At the end of that, there's, like, effing and C-shots and...  We didn't get that far because we had to do a radio show.  Look.  Look how much tape is left on our Girls Gone Wild video.  Oh, my.  We barely put a dent in it.  No, that's not true, though.  Oh, that's the beginning?  Hold on.  That's where the... 
[01:39:30]  Oh, we just missed that.  We just missed.  We have, like...  Oh, Norton, stop it.  We have maybe a quarter inch of tape left, and that, I'm assuming, is where the, you  know, the hardcore.  The hardcore.  I'm not lying.  I swear to God.  No, I believe you, because a bunch of people have called and said that.  People could just buy porn, though, if you want hardcore, man.  Porn, you know, there's no mystery about it.  It's, you know, that's all it is.  Yeah, but these girls are, like, real.  They're not, like, fake screaming and stuff like that.  That's true.  You know what I'm saying?  All right, Joe.  Thank you.  Later.  Now, Wild Man has something else to say.  Wild Man.  Yeah, how are you guys doing? 
[01:40:00]  All right.  Yeah, I own the entire collection of girls, Dawn Wild.  The entire collection.  He's very proud of it, like he's collecting art.  Is this, like, an AA meeting?  Yeah.  It's, like, an AA meeting.  I own the entire collection.  Hi, my name's Jim, and I whack my bag.  Hi, Jim.  No, what I like to say is the tape they probably sent you, when you buy the first tape, it's  okay, and it shows the little TNA and that, and gets in it.  But then, as they say, well, do you want the additional four tapes with it? 
[01:40:30]  And I know it's where it really gets into the hardcore and the clam shots and that stuff.  So they probably sent you just the last one in the series, the best one, you know?  It's kind of like a drug dealer.  They give you just a little taste.  Yeah, something like that.  Here's a little taste.  You want some more?  Yeah, you know, okay.  But, you know, it's as good as that blonde was when you were down in Philly doing your  show live down here, you know, in the balcony there.  Oh, cool, man.  All right.  Well, thank you, wild man.  Hey, I'll call back. 
[01:41:00]  Thank you.  All right.  You know who I love in porn?  Do you guys know who Max Hardcore is?  Max Hardcore.  Heard of it.  He's a little odd guy with, like, blondish hair, and he always wears nothing but brown shoes.  And he's the angriest man.  He's like, yeah, he's a little whore.  Or, yeah.  You don't know anyone who knows who he is is going, yes, he's a classic.  Yeah.  Yeah, he was the one who did the slap happies, but he had a little...  Oh, slap happies.  No, no, no, no, no.  Let him know.  What?  He was the original guy.  He didn't do slap happy.  Another guy did with a much bigger mule, which is why slap happy is just so good.  Just, oh, you know, that's a real lesson teacher. 
[01:41:30]  Nothing better than grabbing the back of that head by the hair.  A little toilet seat over the head.  You've got to respect that.  The C word written across a forehead.  Which I didn't like.  No, that took out, believe it or not, that took out the reality for me.  I would never write that on a woman.  I would just whisper it to my friends.  That's what she left.  Kevin, what's up?  Hey, what's going on?  Kevin has a problem with the Girls Gone Wild tapes.  What's the matter, sweetie?  Are you there?  Yeah, go.  I got...  They said the thing comes on late at night, says you get two videos for $9.99 or whatever. 
[01:42:00]  I called in and did it.  You know, they said, they want to send you a whole bunch of them.  I said, nah, I just want the one.  Like an idiot, I put it on my credit card.  After the first one, they bill you like $30 for each film after.  They just keep sending them to you.  You call back, tell them you don't want them.  They keep mail them.  I got built for like about $90 out of it, but I got a few tapes out of the deal.  They just keep sending them.  They keep sending it.  There you go.  Well, I'm wondering, the second tape I got, there's a good one.  There's a girl on there.  There's like a big party somewhere. 
[01:42:30]  Nice.  See, I never liked that either.  The whole thing came right in there.  I never like things in...  It's weird.  Like, I'm not into like the...  Like, I'll hit whipped cream on him, lick it off.  No, you won't.  Yeah, it's kind of stupid.  I don't like any type of food or...  No, food stops.  Nah.  Or even dildos.  I never...  I just like...  I like just a girl, you know.  I don't know, I'm weird.  Silly.  I'm a purist.  You know, silly gal.  You're a purist.  You know, big pack of pranks down there.  If you're watching a movie, I think it's fine to have any toys in the movie or whatnot. 
[01:43:00]  Just a mule.  That's fine.  Nah.  Just the mule, right?  A mule.  All right.  I can't relate to a toy.  I put myself in the position when I'm watching a movie.  You're a classical type of guy.  Yeah.  Right back to the basics.  Keep it simple.  Ah, right.  That's great.  Anthony, more instant feedback coming in as far as this 80s show thing goes.  Oh, yeah.  It's a portable phone.  Potsy from Buffalo writes, I'm not having a seizure, I'm breakdancing. 
[01:43:30]  Or Steve has that 40s show.  No, it's not a bomb.  It's an atomic bomb.  My whole family has just disintegrated.  My skin is melting.  My family's shadows are burnt on the air.  And we all have cancer.  We can go back to the 80s.  Ah, hey, Mr. Holden, look out for that coffee table. 
[01:44:00]  Oh, he's a good network.  Just a nice parachute pants dick.  Yeah, they're coming in like crazy now.  All right.  The 80s were awful.  The only good thing about the 80s is that the American Psycho book was written about the 80s.  Ah, what a wonderful one.  Which the movie sucked.  Ah, the movie was kind of cool.  I loved the movie.  I liked it.  I read the book first.  It was true.  Well, you and your books.  Yeah, I know the book was more violent.  We got us a reader.  Yeah.  No, I was just perusing. 
[01:44:30]  Perusing.  You've got to love the dialogue in American Psycho.  Come on.  Dude, the book is so violent, you feel like you need a shower when you're done.  And when I read the book, the movie, they took out racist lines.  Like, it's okay to show a woman being killed, but don't say anything that's not really nice about other people's rights.  You know, it's just disgusting.  They took all the violence out trying to be brilliant.  Took all the violence out.  They compared to the book, believe me, it was a nursery story.  Don't just stare at it. 
[01:45:00]  Eat it.  I loved that line.  I didn't like him as Bateman either.  He's always a great actor.  Really?  Great actor.  But yeah, I just didn't.  Walked up behind the chick with the nail gun.  Yeah.  Probably shouldn't have read the book before.  In the book, not only does he have a nail gun, but he nails the girl to wood, like a crucifix.  Yeah.  And he takes brie cheese and rubs it on the sea and hooks up a habit trail and lets a rat go.  Holy cow.  Wow.  And because the habit trail is too big to fit in certain parts, you have to put some hydrochloric acid on the parts to melt them away. 
[01:45:30]  And then you jam the habit trail in.  I'm telling you, the book was sexy.  You and your books.  Dude, the violence in that was unprecedented.  Why wouldn't they put that in a movie?  That's fantastic.  The bum that he kills in the book, he slices his eye and it leaks out and it's great.  Why not?  Because they needed time for the Genesis rap.  That was good in the book too, actually.  Was it?  Yeah.  Yeah, but the violence, dude.  The violence.  Car battery hooked up to nips.  I mean.  Yeah.  Oh, the type of stuff you can whack your bag through for weeks. 
[01:46:00]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  It's a bitches that'll get you.  The bitches that what?  It's a bitches that'll get you.  It's a bitches that'll get you.  It's a bitches that'll get you.  Well, you know, celebrities always, always in the limelight when it comes to divorces, marriages, breakups, and the bitches that'll get you. 
[01:46:30]  It's a bitches that'll get you.  Neil Diamond's marriage mystery.  Superstar singer Neil Diamond.  It's a bitches that'll get you.  And his young lover, Rachel Farley, she's sporting a new diamond ring.  And inside is wondering if the pair had secretly tied the knot.  Neil Diamond is a friggin' jackass if he married this woman.  He's already a two-time loser, which is two times too many, but you always got to give the guys one shot. 
[01:47:00]  Right?  Please?  You F up once.  That's it.  Once the bitch gets you once, you don't let her do it again.  It's over?  Right.  Never get married again.  A lot of guys get remarried.  Ugh.  A lot of dopes make it work the second time around.  A lot of dolts make it work the second time around.  Please. 
[01:47:30]  What kind of jack-off would get married like eight times, Larry King?  I mean, how stupid do you have to be?  Larry King.  Well, there's a trade-off.  They might be F-ing him over, but for God's sake, they've got to screw Larry King.  Well, here it is.  Why is this a bitches that'll get you's story?  Well, it's not so much the one he's with now.  He's with a girl who's, what, 30 years old?  He's 61. 
[01:48:00]  Nice.  They started seeing each other in 96.  Well, that makes her, what?  24.  24.  24 while he was 57, so.  No, 55-ish.  Sure.  54.  I like them young.  Sweet Caroline.  It's more about his second wife, who he has kids with that are older than his present girlfriend. 
[01:48:30]  That's great.  He says, the woman he's with now, she's so beautiful and vibrant, she makes me feel 20 again.  Love on the rocks.  Ain't no surprise.  Pull me a drink and I'll give you half my f***.  You f***ing f***.  Get this.  Neil Diamond.  Singer, songwriter.  He writes the songs, he sings the songs. 
[01:49:00]  What do you think this wife, this second wife, had to do with his making it?  Um, she supported him and...  Oh, give me that crap!  She was there for him.  There for him.  No, the guy was...  She cooked meals for him.  The guy was established already as a goddamn singer-songwriter.  A singer-songwriter. 
[01:49:30]  He handed her over, get this, half of his $300 million fortune.  She got $150 million for having sex with Neil Diamond.  For opening her legs and doing her duty.  For spreading them.  And his homes in Aspen, Colorado and Beverly Hills.  The singer swore he'd never marry again.  Of course! 
[01:50:00]  Wait, I gotta play it right away.  It's the bitches that'll get you.  It's the bitches that'll get you.  It's in America.  They're coming to America to screw me.  It's the bitches that'll get you.  Man, how railed...  It's the bitches that'll get you.  ...do guys have to be before they realize...  It's the bitches that'll get you.  It's now all starting to make sense.  So he swore he would never get married again. 
[01:50:30]  And now they get a picture of his new girlfriend there.  Yeah.  With possibly an engagement ring.  My baby f*** me.  Yes, she does.  She got the way to f*** me, baby.  She got the way to f*** me.  Awful.  And if he hooks up with this broad...  He deserves it.  And he did marry her.  Yeah, then all bets are off.  Cracklin' Rosie took my cash. 
[01:51:00]  Never thought I'd pay so much for gash.  She took my cash.  Showed me her gash.  Poor son of a bitch.  That ain't right.  The guy...  She didn't contribute to what this guy did.  Who wrote the laws that allow these twats to come in, 
[01:51:30]  take half your money you earn by your own talents and merit,  while these whores who did nothing more than spread them,  accepting a load...  Yeah.  You're talking to a wall right now.  Why?  What?  What?  What?  You're talking to a wall.  I'm talking about Neil Diamond.  I know.  We all know it's not fair, but it happens every day.  Well...  And you know what? 
[01:52:00]  Gene Simmons got trashed so hard by people that day when he was in.  This will never happen to him.  I know.  You can trash him all you want, but he's like,  you get nothing, bitch.  Boop.  Out.  Well, he's also Gene Simmons.  Neil Diamond.  300 million.  I know.  300 million.  That's a lot of money, man.  She took everything, even the change in my blue jeans.  The change in my blue jeans.  September morning.  She took my cash and reamed out my a**hole. 
[01:52:30]  Girl.  Song sung blue.  This c**t took my houses.  Song sung blue.  This c**t took my houses.  Girl.  You'll be a c**t when you take my money.  I'll pay for your lawyer. 
[01:53:00]  And he c**t me right in the c**t.  Still talking about Neil Doe, right?  Of course.  Okay, I just got to make sure.  Don't want you getting in any trouble or anything.  I am getting c**t.  I am, said I.  I am.  I am.  I am.  I am.  I am.  I am.  I am.  I am.  I am.  I am.  I am.  I am.  I am.  I am.  I am.  I am.  I am.  I am.  I am.  I am.  I am.  I am.  I am.  I am.  I am.  I am.  I am.  I am. 
[01:53:30]  Yeah, well.  It's not fair.  It is not fair.  I write this song.  That's.  That's.  That's.  Barry Manilow.  Barry Manilow.  Whatever.  They're both.  Get your faggety fingers straight, sir.  Exactly.  Come on.  Neil Diamond rules.  Hey, women want equal rights.  You know, they deserve to get half the money for doing nothing.  Oh, it's ridiculous.  Come on.  I'd scrub this toilet for $150 million and give them a little. 
[01:54:00]  You would do it for $1.50.  It's nothing more than you could get from prostitutes and maids.  Yeah, and they leave when they're done.  And they leave, and they take a reasonable rate for their services rendered.  And they don't rag and nag you so that when it's over, they rape you for half your money.  Someone's on the phone lines.  Well, I'll let them say it.  Paul, what's up?  You.  What's up?  Go ahead, man.  If you got $300 million, why would you care about $150? 
[01:54:30]  You can't spend $300 million the rest of your life anyway.  You're a stupid, stupid man.  Now, believe me, first of all, it's what you earned.  Maybe he enjoyed those houses that he had to give over time.  Right.  Yeah.  Maybe there's not a monetary value you could put on those fine homes that he had to give up.  And secondly, when you're going through a divorce like poor Neil Diamond,  I'm sure he did not want to hand over $150 million to her.  Yep.  But why would he care?  Dude, you know something?  You would. 
[01:55:00]  You would care.  If you have $30,000, you'll care about $15,000.  If you have a million, you'll care about a half a million.  Believe me, you don't want somebody that you cannot stand anymore getting your hard-earned money.  You know when they should split the money?  I would have $40,000 in my background.  When you're a singing team, you should split it.  When you sing and she does nothing, she should get a little.  That's it.  All right. 
[01:55:30]  And that's today's...  It's the bitches that'll get you's.  It's the bitches that'll get you's.  The bitches that'll get you's.  And one more quick installment of It's the Bitches That'll Get You.  Last night on Dateline, get what this hose bag is up to.  Another woman marries this guy.  He's in his 70s.  She's in her 50s.  The guy makes her sign a prenup before they get married. 
[01:56:00]  For some reason, he writes in the contract, in the prenup, that all bets are off if he has some kind of adultery.  Some cheating goes on.  That's in the prenup.  Why else would he get divorced?  I know.  I don't understand it.  So, the woman goes to the summer home.  She goes to do something with the bed.  She pulls the spread back, sees stains on the sheets and hairs that aren't hers. 
[01:56:30]  She wraps the sheet up, puts it in a plastic bag, and takes it for DNA testing and whatnot.  They figure out that these are fluids, mixed fluids from him and some other person.  Can't say whether it's a woman or not.  And the hairs that aren't hers, his or hers.  Right.  Now, she's suing for $20,000 a month in alimony because the prenup now, she says, is no good. 
[01:57:00]  Meanwhile, all she could have done was yank some pubes out of a co-worker, put them in the sheet, because she doesn't want to be with the guy anymore, because she had total control of this sheet the whole time.  And put it in the bag.  What, Norton?  It may not go through.  There's no real proof there.  Again, what you're saying, any defense lawyer, any of his lawyers will certainly raise that.  You know what?  The bitches that'll get you.  These goddamn attorneys and judges, they side on the side of the goddamn bitches. 
[01:57:30]  It's a bitches that'll get you.  Time after time.  So this poor bastard's not going to get off scot-free.  If it's legal fees alone, he's getting effed.  It's the bitches that'll get you.  Tom, what's your problem?  Now, Anthony, you sound so bitter.  I'm not sounding half as bitter as I am, my friend.  Believe me.  You should take Neil Diamond's wife, let Norton have his way with her back on an alley, and fill her full of AIDS.  Thank you, sir. 
[01:58:00]  You're welcome.  Thank you, Tom.  Sherry wants to argue the other side of this, Anthony.  Good.  Go ahead.  Try it.  Sherry?  Hello.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  This is Sherry from Washington, D.C.  Hello.  Be nice.  How are you doing?  Hi.  Speak, please.  You're on the air.  Well, I was just listening to your conversation about Neil Diamond.  Yeah.  And if he was already an established star, why didn't he do a prenup when he got married? 
[01:58:30]  You know what?  I believe he got married.  No, I say started from scratch where, you know, they both worked together to build it.  Because a legal document is, first of all, I think it was in the early 70s or something, this marriage.  And I don't know how big prenups were at that time.  I don't know.  It was still his fault.  He probably should have gone to a lawyer.  He should have had something.  But, legal document or not, she is not entitled to half of what he earned on his talents and merits. 
[01:59:00]  Period.  How is that justified, Sherry?  Well, but she could have helped him behind the scenes.  Bullcrap.  You know what?  She could have.  Do we know that for sure?  All right.  Give me an example.  What would justify helping in the way of $150 million and two houses?  I'm not justifying that.  That's what I'm saying, though.  If she wanted...  She helped run the house.  Did she run kids?  Did she run their kids?  If she wanted an hourly wage that a housekeeper would make and a babysitter and a maid and a prostitute, that's fine. 
[01:59:30]  Add it up.  Paid in full.  It ain't going to come out to $150 million.  Didn't he write most of the songs before he married this lady?  Yeah, the guy wrote...  That's what I'm saying.  He should have had some, his lawyer.  Where was his lawyer?  Well, you know something?  When that evil, evil word, effing love, comes into it, you forget about things like your own safety when these things happen.  Well, but again, they both went into it probably ever thinking that it would come to them. 
[02:00:00]  You never know.  I mean, but you have to cover yourself.  But still, she probably took care of his home, their home.  All right, Sherry.  Did she have a job?  Sherry, do you think it's fair that she gets $150 million plus two houses?  No, I do not.  Thank you.  I don't.  Fair is fair.  But she should get something, because she was fair.  How many years were they married?  Wait, Anthony is not arguing at that point.  But $150 million?  That's a lot. 
[02:00:30]  What's wrong with $25 million?  I mean, look at Michael Jordan.  He's going to lose half.  How about a million?  No, you just don't want...  Can't live on a million?  If you're together that long, $25 million in a house, when he's got that much, when he keeps $275 million in a house, I've got no problem with that.  You know something?  Maybe even that.  But no, that's even too much, I believe.  It depends on, you know, it depends on the circumstances.  What the hell is she doing that merits that?  It depends on how long you're married.  That does depend on how long.  It doesn't.  Not in my mind.  If she married him before he had cash, sometimes...  If a girl marries you when you're nothing... 
[02:01:00]  But she didn't.  That's well established in the story.  I don't know.  Do they have kids?  Nope.  Doesn't make sense to me.  I don't care what the F the situation was.  It doesn't make sense.  It does not make sense.  If you and your missus open up a business together and make all kinds of money, split it down the goddamn middle.  Hallelujah.  God bless you both.  Right.  Have a great life.  And I think...  If the entire income is based on one person's talents...  And I think it would have been different if he had not already been established. 
[02:01:30]  If he was starting from nothing and they worked on it together.  No!  If he was already there...  Still no.  She is not doing the work that it took him.  He's the creative person writing the music.  He created an atmosphere for him to do his work.  Bull crap.  He could have done it in a shoebox.  She could have done it.  I could have done it.  He could have done it in a shoebox.  You guys are crazy.  I love listening to you guys.  You're wonderful.  Why don't you tell someone, Sherry?  That would help us. 
[02:02:00]  I do.  I tell everybody.  And Washington, D.C. is great.  But I love you.  Thank you.  Bye.  As we search out our audience in Washington, D.C.  It's getting bigger.  I'll be what I am.  A broke f***ing man.  Jim, I can see for myself.  You don't have to say that.  Naughty 90?  Yeah.  We're just waiting for another show.  Yeah.  She's sexy.  All right.  We'll talk to her next, then.  And we better have a 6 o'clock queef tonight.  It's the bitches that'll get you. 
[02:02:30]  What happened to the 6 o'clock queef yesterday?  I don't know.  She's probably going to a lawyer for our money.  Wow.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  What do you do here?  Look at breasts.  If I wasn't on this show, I'd be out there with a wow sticker just trolling for breasts.  Thank you.  Oh, yeah.  And we're back with the O.B. and Anthony Show. 
[02:03:00]  That blonde outside the studio is smoking.  Wait till you see her pictures.  And she joins the Naughty 90 contest.  Hey, man.  New York is representing just fine so far.  I don't know what's going on with the other cities.  I was trying to peek at her from the back.  And she's like, get her out of there.  Pictures will be up on O.B. and Anthony.com within the next half hour or so.  Yeah, she didn't like Norton peering.  She's looking, though.  I wasn't feeling good. 
[02:03:30]  Rick got her ass perched way up in the air.  It's like she's on the Ikea furniture.  She's on the couch, sort of on her elbows, with her head in her hands, on her knees, with her ass just sticking up in the air.  Just waiting to have a bicycle parked right there.  You know what I mean?  And Norton's sitting by the computer in the back.  So he's got a view right there.  And she goes, don't look.  Don't look.  Yeah, she's got that English accent.  You're looking.  You're really bugging me.  You're looking at my bum.  My bum. 
[02:04:00]  And then he ran over, like, in fast motion, like Benny Hill.  Tapped her on the head.  Dun, dun, dun, dun.  But I wasn't, I didn't have my face right.  I was just standing there looking, like, oh, how lovely.  Oh, nice.  Gal gone wild.  Nice.  You're bummed.  You're bummed.  You can't say that, Opie.  What?  I was just kind of imitating the bum song from Tom Green.  All right.  More 80s show references coming in. 
[02:04:30]  It's a portable phone.  Again.  Again, every single break they're playing that commercial, they are pushing the hell  out of it, aren't they?  They're pushing more than we're pushing this bit.  Yeah.  And that's hard to believe.  Right.  Eh.  You know, I don't even know if this one's going to get past the censors.  I'm just going to try it, because this guy nugget from Buffalo is hilarious.  Hey, it's that 20s show. 
[02:05:00]  That ain't going to make it.  That ain't going to make it.  That ain't going to make it.  That ain't going to make it.  What?  No.  Sorry, nugget.  I tried.  Eric from Jersey has that 40s show.  No, that baseball player isn't wearing face paint.  That's Jackie Robinson.  I like the 80s show, you know. 
[02:05:30]  Hey, it's Superman, and he's walking.  Hey!  Oh, you're awful.  Jesus.  Hey, Robert Chambers, choke that skinny bitch to death!  Did that guy get out?  He's out, right?  No.  Bobby Chambers still in jail.  No, he's in jail.  Chambers is still in jail? 
[02:06:00]  Bobby's, I like to call him.  He's got to get out soon, right?  He's never all went.  Hey, the phones have exploded here.  There's a bunch of little things going on.  Let's start with Vito.  Vito, what's up?  Make it fast.  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey, I think Neil Diamond should take some advice from Eddie Murphy.  What did Eddie Murphy...  ...buy, and you lose half on the trade-in.  Hey, you can't put it that way, my friend.  You can't put it...  You'll lose it.  Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.  Hey, you clean it up.  Yeah, after you clean it up.  You cannot do Eddie Murphy bits verbatim on the air. 
[02:06:30]  Jesus.  He said, you're leasing the, uh...  Ah, pooh-ha with the option to buy.  But, eh...  And then the trade-in, you lose it on the trade-in.  You sure do.  De-values.  Ah, Tim, what's up?  I just want to let Ann know that you can find some of Neil Diamond's clothes at the Beverly Hills Salvation Army.  Nice call back.  You dick. 
[02:07:00]  Your phone kind of...  Your portable phone crapped out, but...  Neil Diamond's clothes are at the Beverly Hills Salvation Army.  Very good.  All right, boys, see ya.  All right.  And breaking news.  Yeah?  I don't know why they hung up on all the breaking news.  Breaking news?  Yeah, I guess Tyson apologized or something?  I am.  I'm sorry.  And this is a...  There's two breaking news stories going on right now.  Evil Eric, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Hey, man.  Got some bad news.  What?  Just saw in the news, they found OJ's girlfriend.  And the real bad part is, she's alive. 
[02:07:30]  Ah, God damn it.  We were hoping this time.  OJ lost his balls.  Yeah.  Tell you guys my life to know.  You guys suck.  Take care.  I was getting so psyched, they found OJ's girlfriend alive.  Yeah, that was a good story, though, because people were freaking, like, she was missing  for a while, and there was a bad odor coming from the house.  The neighbor said, and it turns out to be her cat.  His girlfriend, Christy Proddy, her name is, her house was ransacked. 
[02:08:00]  And the neighbor said that there was a smell coming out of it, bad smell.  So, the cops go there.  Now, you know what they must be thinking.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  This is OJ's girlfriend's house.  What are we going to walk into?  And they opened the door and found a dead cat, her cat dead, in the doorway in the apartment  ransacked.  And we've all had that.  I mean, who hasn't had a pussy stink up the room?  Cat, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, of course.  You know, with their pet odors.  That ain't lying.  Those darned pet odors. 
[02:08:30]  That ain't lying.  Why?  Because it won't.  We can explain from now until seven.  That ain't lying.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  No, no.  That didn't get through.  Good try, though.  So, then she's been missing.  And go figure.  The cops figured, well, maybe we ought to talk with OJ.  But he said, no, no.  They asked her where she was.  And he goes, she's out and about.  I said, well, OJ, what does that even mean?  I don't know. 
[02:09:00]  She's out and about.  I learned one thing from the last time.  You can't just leave them around on the sidewalk.  You got to get rid of them.  I believe I saw her leave with Pedro Guerrero.  Yeah, like the last time that OJ, maybe Christy's still missing.  OJ just skinned her and put the mask on.  The Christy Pratty mask.  Hello?  No, I'm fine.  I'm here in my house with my dead cat.  Look, it's me, Christy. 
[02:09:30]  I keep the lights dim.  But look, see?  For two seconds.  Hey, hello.  Look.  Shut the door again.  No, it's me.  Look.  Look, see?  Hello.  There you go.  Enough of a look.  What, the blood dripping down my chest?  So they spoke with OJ.  He said she was out and about, but didn't know where she was.  OJ's lawyer, get this thing.  He goes, oh, I don't even know why they're talking to OJ.  They're not even going out anymore. 
[02:10:00]  If I recall, I don't believe he was going out with Nicole at the time either.  If you remember, she was getting the Hummers in the window of her house as OJ was peering in.  Yep.  Let me look in the window and see what my beloved's doing.  Ha-la-la-la-la.  Oh, no.  What?  Were you saying something for the lesson?  All right, let me look.  I'm sorry, but our latest contestants up on opandanthony.com.  It's the Naughty Nighty Contest. 
[02:10:30]  Ba-ba-ba-ba-stand down.  Look at that.  Which one?  All of them.  Look at the first picture.  Now we're going through, now we're going to the see-through phase of the contest.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, she's wearing like kind of a little see-through number.  Stavita has joined the contest.  I'm actually tweaking my nip.  All right.  Oh, would you stop it?  Her pictures are up on opandanthony.com, our latest contestant.  I believe I see.  I hope another contestant shows up before 7 today.  You see something through those pink panties in the last shot? 
[02:11:00]  Yeah.  Hey, turn around.  Here, come here a minute.  Go over there by Norton.  Stand by the light.  DeVita, why don't you stop right there.  Wait a minute.  Norton, roll out of the way a minute.  I'm sorry, Ant.  Turn around.  Can I see something?  No, no.  Face me forward.  I want to see if I'm seeing something in the picture.  Oh, yeah.  You're seeing that?  Yeah.  What?  That's very see-through.  Is that too see-through?  No.  No.  There is no such thing as too see-through.  No.  No such thing.  Cellophane isn't too see-through.  Hey, do we have pictures of her in this red outfit? 
[02:11:30]  Are they going up?  I just thought...  All right.  You've got to add more pictures to her profile.  Online.  No, I believe you.  I just saw the pictures with the other top on, and I'm thinking the red thing might put  her over the top.  Holy yes.  Is that picture going up?  Yeah.  I hope so.  Where'd you get the bruise on the leg?  What happened?  Someone beating you?  Which one?  I got a couple.  No, you know, I have a huge big 14-foot-long pet python at home named Pookie.  He's 120 pounds.  Go on the mic there.  There you go.  You got a pet python named Pookie.  Pookie at home, and two huge iguanas, and my python's 120 pounds, 14 feet long. 
[02:12:00]  Really?  And I had to bathe him today.  What are you doing with a python?  Oh, he's my pet.  He's your pet?  Yeah.  You should have brought him in to help out your pictures.  I know, I know.  I mean, your pictures look great, though.  I know.  And I got to say it.  Someone around here has to.  I believe we have a finalist.  Finalist.  Finalist.  I definitely see it.  Sounds very excited about being a finalist.  All right, let me tell you something.  If the pictures of her in this red outfit don't go up, we're insane. 
[02:12:30]  Well, we're insane anyway.  And Rick, I must say, good pictures you're taking.  Thank you, too.  I was lingerie shopping today.  Wow.  Dude, I blasted off like 40 shots.  Pink pussycat for like three hours.  I'm sorry.  I'm reading some part of these people.  I cannot read your That 30s Show reference, Mike, from Bayside.  You should imagine.  We had enough trouble with the Kogan's Heroes guy for me to read your 30s show.  Norton, just look at this.  Let me get Norton's reaction. 
[02:13:00]  Turn around.  Turn around.  That's probably the most heinous thing that's ever been written.  Oh, my God.  See, that's not a...  We're right.  No, see, we're responsible broadcasters, Anthony.  That's horrible.  Oh, we're still talking to the hot piece of egg.  And Warren from Connecticut, we can't read that one either.  Let me get a noise reaction to this. 
[02:13:30]  That's 1780s show.  That's not an employee.  Yeah.  Yeah, you guys are going a little over the top there.  A lot of people want to talk to DeVito about their pythons.  About their pythons?  Oh, no.  What?  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  You kind of got the look that O.J. would like to slit your throat.  You got that blonde thing going.  Yeah. 
[02:14:00]  It's not all about the big boobs.  I'm telling you right now.  Those are very, very nice.  They're perfect.  They're very nice.  My bum's not too small.  Me bum.  Me bum.  How come you chased me away?  I was just looking at my old hiney, having a laugh.  Having a laugh.  Yeah, he was looking at your hiney perched up like that.  I wasn't being mean or going, ugh.  She's keeping the British end up, you know.  I was just a jiggle.  I couldn't stop jiggling.  Dan from Home Broken, he writes,  Norton staring at her bum must be more scary than Paula Poundstone trying to be your foster parent. 
[02:14:30]  All right.  I'm such a perfect...  All right, so you have to come to the VIP.  Huh?  You have to come to the VIP.  Oh, VIP.  VIP.  I heard you have to...  Okay, yeah.  VIP, sure.  VIP, meh, meh, of course, meh.  Go to VIP in the city and check out Davida as she dances.  You do lap dances?  Yeah.  Okay.  Oh, Austin.  Oh.  Our pictures are up on opianthony.com.  We're going to add the ones in the red outfit in a few minutes here. 
[02:15:00]  I'm going to the stinky cam for a second.  Oh, yeah.  We've got to put something on the stinky cam.  I'll get a little...  For the fellas.  For the fellas.  For the guys.  You know, the pals that are playing along at home.  Bunch of chums.  Oh, buds.  All right, champ.  There you go.  God, am I homely?  There you go.  What?  What's the...  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  All right.  We can't use that P-U word. 
[02:15:30]  Looks like she had a tuna fish sandwich for lunch.  I had a tuna fish sandwich.  All right, we'll get you some gum.  Tuna fish.  We'll get you some gum.  I need some...  I love your tuna fish.  Comes in cans.  No bones.  I have gum in my pocket.  No gum.  No, I have gum.  Oh, you said gum.  Okay.  I thought you said something else in your pocket, which I wouldn't doubt either.  Oh, yeah.  Norton.  All right.  You just stay there.  Just stay there and let a few pictures snap away so our friends at home can... 
[02:16:00]  Hold on.  Hey, you just made our screensaver in the studio.  I did?  Yes.  How about that?  Ben's responsible for the screensaver and he just changed the picture to you, Davida.  Rick is fluffing her hair.  It looks better.  What are you doing there?  There you go.  Give me the hair a little tussle.  Someone let me know when the pictures of her in the red outfit are up.  That's good.  Leave it like a note.  It's Davida.  I can't handle this.  Sight's getting slammed, though.  All right.  That's fine. 
[02:16:30]  Wowee.  That'll work, yeah?  Jersey Gary, that teens show.  The Red Sox won the World Series.  Hey, come on.  You got to give him that one, Ben, right?  Come on.  All right.  Have some fun.  Christine, what's going on?  Christine?  Yes.  Hello.  Hi.  What's up?  I'm calling to do the six o'clock queef. 
[02:17:00]  Oh!  Where are you calling from?  Philadelphia.  Philadelphia representing.  We'll be there Friday broadcasting live.  You guys rock.  Hold on.  It's not a burp.  It's not a fart.  It's not too sweet.  It's not too tart.  It's six o'clock.  It's time for a queef.  Yes.  Blow out the candles.  Make a wish.  It's like a fart, but smells like fish.  It's six o'clock.  It's time for a queef.  Undo your pants.  Let them drop to the floor.  Dance up and let yourself roar.  Queef. 
[02:17:30]  All right, Christine.  Give me one second.  All right.  Let's all be quiet.  All right, here it is.  Ready?  Yes.  Here I go.  Okay.  All right.  It's not a burp.  It's not a fart.  It's not too sweet.  It's not too tart.  It's six o'clock.  It's time for a queef.  Thank you.  Blow out the candles.  Make a wish.  It's like a fart, but smells like fish.  It's six o'clock.  It's time for a queef.  Undo your pants.  Let them drop to the floor. 
[02:18:00]  Dance up and let yourself roar.  Queef.  She had that slow roller.  It sounded like an approaching crop duster.  That was nice.  It sounded like a bong hit.  Like an old Three Stooges snore, didn't it?  All right.  Back to the naked girl in the studio.  DeVita.  I'm so retarded.  I'm so queefing.  Hey, what's wrong with the queef?  The six o'clock queef?  Oh, no. 
[02:18:30]  Where are you going, British Ben?  What do you actually do for a living?  I'm a neurological brain surgeon during the day.  All righty.  Certainly.  So, like I said, what do you do during the day?  What's your normal occupation?  She plays with her python.  She's studying to be a veterinarian.  Are you really?  I'm not.  Well, what do you do?  Okay.  I really honestly.  Yeah.  Okay.  I wake up.  I clean my house.  I bathe my twig on it.  Yeah.  And then I drag my 120-foot-long, 120-pound, 14-foot-long pet python across the floor like this. 
[02:19:00]  Yeah.  Into the bathroom.  All right.  And wrestle with it like a scene out of Anaconda for like 20 minutes while he's like flapping and...  Are you a kept girl?  You're in a relationship that they're going...  My boyfriend's in the slammer right now.  Or something.  He's a bad boy.  What do you do?  Really?  No.  He's in Fort Dix, federal institutional.  Fort Dix, Fed.  Federal institutional.  What did he do? 
[02:19:30]  He was doing some bad stuff.  Selling dope?  Yeah, selling stuff.  Yeah, there you go.  How long was he there for?  Six months.  That's not bad.  Short little stint.  Do that on your...  Stand it on your head.  A little pause.  Is it like Oz?  I don't know.  Apparently, it's not so bad.  Is he thin and pale like yourself?  No, he's a big six-foot-five, 200-pound diesel juice head.  Oh, so he's the one that's doing the effing in prison. 
[02:20:00]  Oh, I guess so.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  He's a big bubble in prison, I guess.  Yeah.  And now, what do you do to make ends meet there?  I'm back to VIP.  All right.  I'm back to VIP.  Well, maybe she was...  Jesus.  I thought maybe I'd trust one now.  Oh, I thought maybe, you know.  Yeah.  There you go.  So, your boyfriend...  She's got the acquired brain cells.  Yeah.  What did he sell?  Crack, right?  No.  No.  Six months, man.  Juice.  Oh, steroids. 
[02:20:30]  Juice.  Steroids.  Oh.  God, that's nothing.  No.  What a victimless crime that is.  I know it's a victimless crime, but...  Oh, it's just people that want to do it.  ...the federal correctional institution thinks it's really bad.  You know.  Juice.  So, is he all, like, big, juiced up?  Big, pumped up.  Oh, my God.  I love this part of the show.  People are checking out the pictures, and they want to comment.  Joe, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  All right.  Divina, delicious.  Davida.  Davida.  Davida.  If you would go back to the photos, picture number two, it's the rear shot. 
[02:21:00]  Yeah.  Please take a look to the right side of the panties, and you'll notice that little cocktail  hole, Frank, popping out the side.  Oh, my Lord.  It's delicious.  Damn it.  Who?  Did someone get it?  I can't see it now, because the website's going to be pounded, and it's going to be even  worse now.  What he meant?  Hey, Rick, what's up?  Yeah, what's up, boys?  Hey.  Yeah, I just want to let you know I got a new show for you.  All right.  That 2000 show.  Yeah.  Davida gets her GED. 
[02:21:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Thank you, Rick.  I just want to say Norton's the man, and shout out Jersey.  All right.  Joe, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I think something's amiss when the theme song's longer than your segment for the six o'clock  week.  That's the whole day.  Don't you get it?  Oh, do we have to explain it all?  You don't get it.  Yes.  All right.  That's what's fun about it.  Right.  We don't even interview them or nothing.  How did you not get that?  Oh. 
[02:22:00]  Because the song is actually longer than the queef.  Longer than the queef.  Hey, look, guys.  Richard Pryor's running down the street on fire.  Michael Jackson's following them.  On fire.  Hey, look.  A radio host name is being shouted out on a television show.  That's it. 
[02:22:30]  Say, look.  Yeah.  Showing the ass.  Very good.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  That's lovely.  Brian.  Yes.  What's up?  Brian, what's up?  Who's this?  It's Opie Anthony.  Go ahead.  Oh, okay.  Don't sound the same way.  Hey, I think you're getting blinded by this girl's good looks.  She's really getting...  She's annoying.  Her accent's annoying.  Her story's about her python. 
[02:23:00]  She's growing old.  You need to get rid of it.  No, Drew.  You mean she's been talking?  I didn't.  Have you been talking?  No.  Oh, okay.  I didn't think so.  All right.  Thank you, Brian.  Hey, you guys are great.  Talk to you later.  Let me go to Anthony.  Anthony, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  I got a show.  Yeah, the Do It Rise, the payphone guy, or the, you know, the...  The commercial.  Yeah.  That 60s show.  Hey, you're not supposed to be drinking at that water fountain. 
[02:23:30]  All right, wait a minute, man.  Jesus, Anthony.  Sorry.  All right.  Chris from Westfield, that 80s show.  No, not a coat rack.  Tracy Gold.  Same thing fits in with that 70s show.  Just put in Karen Clopper.  Clopper, that way.  All right. 
[02:24:00]  Are the pictures of her in the red outfit up yet?  In the red?  Yeah, the red.  Scott's working on it.  Okay, he's working on it.  That's fine.  Oh, boy.  There you go.  Our latest contestant in the Naughty Nighty contest.  I hope more ladies show up tomorrow, Anthony.  Yeah.  We need more girls for this, man.  There's a trip to hedonism.  This is very pathetic.  And I don't even know if the girls are showing up at the other cities and stuff.  I hope so. 
[02:24:30]  We're not getting any word from the other cities, though.  No, that's a bad sign.  One girl from Cleveland is in on the contest.  That's it so far, besides the New York girls represented.  How much longer has the contest gone for?  Weeks.  Weeks?  Yeah, it goes on for a long time.  I have a whole bunch of girlfriends that would do this.  Well.  I just didn't want any of them to win the competition, so.  I didn't talk to anyone about it.  Help us out.  Well, bring the ugly ones in.  I mean, I can't.  Bring fat ones.  At least we could punch them in the back.  Good idea. 
[02:25:00]  All right.  You're going to punch a nice fat back.  Oh, that feels good.  Big meaty thud.  Ow.  They don't even bend when you hit them.  Oh.  Take that fat back.  Fat back.  All right.  All right.  Hey, the rejection hotline.  Yeah.  We'll talk about that next.  All right.  We'll talk about that next. 
[02:25:30]  It's off the hook, yo.  Opie and Anthony.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  Here's the breaking news, Anthony.  Finally.  Oh, by the way, the second set of pictures of Davida are up on opieandanthony.com.  Our latest contestant in the Naughty Nighty contest.  You ladies are letting us down, though.  We should have more women coming to the studio.  Right?  Come on. 
[02:26:00]  Come by tomorrow with your naughty nighties.  You're more than welcome.  While we broadcast from 3 to 7 here in New York.  Yes.  Other cities are participating.  Go to opianthony.com for the details.  Steve, what's going on?  Hello?  Steve?  How's up?  I got a Tyson article in front of me about the apology.  What do you mean?  Oh, well, you know, he apologized for what he did.  And I got some quotes here.  He also apologized to the reporter that he yelled at.  He's got, this is what he said about the reporter. 
[02:26:30]  He goes, after a skirmish, I was provoked by a member of the audience who was shouting obscenities at me.  And I defended myself as I saw fit.  In the process, things that I said may have offended members of the audience.  To these people, I offer my apologies.  So he's not even, like, really taking credit for it.  He's sort of kind of getting his way out of it, I guess.  He shouldn't apologize.  He yelled at some douchey, snotty sports reporter.  Good for Tyson.  He shouldn't apologize.  For what?  I'm shaking him up a bit.  I'm kind of bummed he's apologizing.  He shouldn't.  Well, they probably shot him for some drugs.  And someone wrote that statement for him. 
[02:27:00]  Saying, it's in your best interest to, you know, apologize.  We'll write a little something for you.  Not to be sorry for him, Michael.  He also said, I am not a role model or Mr. Politically Correct.  I think it's a little understatement there, but...  All right.  See you later.  All right.  So we apologize.  I want to hear the audio of him apologizing.  Oh, we have another 80s show thing coming in.  TJ.  Hey.  What's up?  What's up, guys?  Hey, just imagine this. 
[02:27:30]  Tonight, on That's 80s Show.  What's that, Johnny?  A condom?  Why do you use that thing?  Wow.  That was unsettling as it sat there.  It seems so much funnier when we're reading it on the screen there.  It's just hard because he lapsed into a character.  No, I know.  Yeah.  It was written perfectly.  What's that?  She was in the head, Johnny.  It's a condom. 
[02:28:00]  See?  Hey, Johnny.  What's that?  He used the name Johnny.  Yeah.  Hey, man, Dan.  That's not funny.  Dan from Hoboken.  Opie's on That 80s Show.  Hey, that's not Chewbacca.  It's my girlfriend.  How about, hey, it's That 80s Show with Opie.  Sponge Buckley calling in.  That was 1990, dude.  I suck.  Jim, what's going on?  Hey, Jim.  Is it me? 
[02:28:30]  Yeah, man.  Well, if your name's Jim, sure, and you're hearing my voice.  Yeah, why aren't you guys on in Seattle anymore?  What happened?  What?  We're not on in Seattle.  Well, that would make sense.  What happened?  With our zero, zero.  Yeah, we got the ratings for Seattle, and interesting things going on in Seattle.  We have a 0.00 rating.  0.00.  Mr. Blutowski.  0.00.  0.00.  0.00.  We have, you know how some people say we have no ratings in a certain city or whatever? 
[02:29:00]  Yeah.  We have no ratings in Seattle.  I mean, no ratings.  Daniel Simpson Day has no grade point average.  Right.  All courses incomplete.  Mr. Blutowski.  Mr. Blutowski.  No, he had the pencils in his notes.  Jim, we're not on in Seattle today?  Mr. Blutowski.  Nope.  We're not on, and no one's noticing except for Jim.  I know.  Jim, did you listen to this program in Seattle?  Every day.  Then the ratings are wrong.  0.00 means nobody. 
[02:29:30]  Nobody.  Not even you.  One person.  Now, if Jim's listening, that would be at least a 0.0001.  Yeah.  Well, we have three people listening on one radio.  Oh, come on now.  Up to 0.003.  Go to different radios.  Yeah.  Yeah, run around and listen to us on many radios.  What time are you guys running in Seattle?  You're on from like 12 to 4?  We're on now, and then they like rerun in ratings.  I don't know.  They run it like twice, and we can't get ratings. 
[02:30:00]  I looked at the numbers today.  I'm like, is this real, or did the machine malfunction?  It spit out a 0.00.  It's like, no, that's the rating.  That's the rating.  I'm like, what?  So we don't have a success story in Seattle.  Can't win them all.  This whole show, it's a mutual fun, Anthony.  We've got to do lumber jokes.  It's a mutual fun.  Right.  Some do good.  Hey, it's raining today.  Who cares about Seattle?  It sucks. 
[02:30:30]  Wow.  I thought we were feeling a buzz from Seattle.  You were.  It was like that deadline.  Keith, what's going on?  Hello.  Keith, you're on the radio.  What's up?  At that 70s show.  Hey, Dreamweaver.  I'm the Wrangler.  You did.  Now that's funny. 
[02:31:00]  Good job, Keith.  Steve, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey, Steve.  I got one for that 80s show.  Okay.  AIDS.  It's not just a dietary candy anymore.  That rules.  Here's one for New York.  Chris, go ahead.  Hey, guys.  On that 80s show this week.  Yeah.  Black Earl, he'll never last at this station.  Wow.  Hey, got one for New York. 
[02:31:30]  Give you that one.  Very good.  Oh, is that good?  Are we going to have a contestant visit us in Philly on Friday?  Lexus?  Lexus?  Lexus?  Hello.  Hello.  What's up, guys?  Hey, Lexus.  What's going on?  I'm going to come visit you guys on Friday for the Naughty Nighty contest.  Ah.  Yeah, we're hoping a lot of ladies in the Philly area show up at the station when we broadcast live on Friday. 
[02:32:00]  Hopefully, but I'll be there.  So I'll represent Philly even if nobody else shows up.  There you go.  We have a guarantee that someone will be representing for Philly.  Lexus.  Representing.  That's right.  Yeah, all ladies have an open invite to just go to the station with their Naughty Nineties on Friday to get their pictures taken.  Thank you, Lexus.  You're welcome, guys.  See you then.  Good.  There you go.  Something to look forward to.  Pretty gal.  Pretty gal.  Guy, what's going on? 
[02:32:30]  Hey, thanks for taking the call.  No problem.  You guys haven't talked at all about your San Francisco ratings.  I wonder what the numbers are out here and how much longer I'm going to be able to listen to you.  Well, they're a little better than 0.00.  Yes, we can say that.  So we got that going for us.  Which is nice.  Well, I'm glad to hear that.  I've been listening since September, since I started a job that has me driving around all day,  and I have nothing to do but listen to you guys.  So I'm happy to have found you.  Quite frankly, we're not expecting much from San Francisco. 
[02:33:00]  Well, nobody really does.  I hear we're on a little dinky AM out there.  Yes, yes, that's true.  A tiny little dinky AM thing.  Yeah.  But they love the show.  Well, I don't know anybody else who's ever heard of it, but I enjoy it.  Cool.  So I hope that gives you a warm feeling.  Great.  Thank you, guy.  You're so wackos.  All right.  Yeah, what's the rejection line about? 
[02:33:30]  Rickster?  Oh, God.  Hacker dude from Rockland.  Yeah.  80s show.  It's not Tylenol.  It's cyanide.  Yeah, that Tylenol guy was the anthrax guy of his day.  Remember, everyone was petrified.  You used to be able to get your stuff and, like, just stuff that would pop right off.  No childproof, no anti-tamper, stuff like that. 
[02:34:00]  Now everything's wrapped up.  It's in the pill form.  Remember the capsules of Tylenol?  You pull it apart.  Dude, snort it.  You can sell it as speed in your schools, kids.  Or that 70s show.  I love that man.  He's the nicest clown in Chicago.  Adam from D.C. 
[02:34:30]  A little D.C. humor for you.  That 60s show.  Hey, it's not a pay phone.  It's the president's brains and skull.  Thank you, Adam.  Thank you.  All right, Mike.  Mike from the Bronx.  The 90s show.  No, really.  The mayor of Boston is dead. 
[02:35:00]  All right.  Yeah.  Okay.  Very funny.  I'm not reading that one either.  I can't read any from the 30s.  We're leaving out.  You sick bastard.  We're leaving out a whole decade.  We're leaving out two decades.  Yeah.  The 30s.  The 40s.  That 20s.  That 2040 show from Naughty Joe.  Rich Voss is still an effing tool. 
[02:35:30]  Guy's not even here to defend himself.  All right.  I know.  Dreamweaver, Wrangler.  Let's meet up for the weekend.  Funny.  My life.  Oh, the rejection line.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, what is that?  It's actually a hotline.  You know, if you meet somebody, you're out or whatever, you're out in a bar and somebody  wants your phone number, you give them this phone number saying it's yours and they get 
[02:36:00]  rejected for you.  So you don't never have to deal with that person ever again.  Oof.  Why wouldn't you just give out like a fake number?  I guess then they might.  I guess this makes it a little more fun.  Or if they see you around again, they'll think maybe you just, oh, I get it.  He wrote down the wrong number or something.  Yeah, that's one of the excuses they give you.  Oh, really?  Yeah, they have the intro message that you get when you first call.  Then you've got three options.  You can go to the bad poem, the still holding out of hope, and just, you know, just you're 
[02:36:30]  a loser type.  So now some poor son of a bitch, he's out in a bar.  Yeah.  Some hot chick goes out.  Hey, can I have your number?  She gives him the number.  Now he's all hopped up.  All whipped up into a lather.  And he finally works up the balls, calls the number.  Calls the number.  All excited.  Here's that hot chick from the bar.  And this is what he gets.  Welcome to the New York City Rejection Line, brought to you by RejectionLine.com.  Oh.  Unfortunately, the person who gave you this number does not want to talk to you or speak to you 
[02:37:00]  again.  Oh, that's awful.  We would like to take this opportunity to officially reject you.  Our certified rejection specialists are waiting to serve you in your time of need.  Please listen carefully to the following options.  If you want to hear from our comfort specialist, press one.  If you want to hear a sad poem written by a kindred spirit, press two.  If you want to cling to the unrealistic hope that a relationship is still possible, press 
[02:37:30]  three.  Wow.  We've got to hear these now.  So now you've got to press one, and you'll get the comfort specialist.  All right.  Let's listen to that.  Comfort specialist.  Yeah.  All right.  Hey, pumpkin.  I know this hurts.  I know.  I know.  The mean-spirited individual who gave you this number does not know you, the real you,  the you behind the mask.  You do, don't you?  Now I want you to find that little sad child, pick it up by the bootstraps, and keep putting 
[02:38:00]  plug-in, camper.  Camper.  There are plenty of fish in the sea, and you're a fisher extraordinaire.  She sounds f***able.  Being alone is okay, too.  And if you start to feel real down in the dumps, there's always, always alcohol.  Sweet, comforting alcohol.  Or frozen Snickers bars.  Yeah.  You like those, don't you?  Yeah.  Happy fishing, camper.  Thank you. 
[02:38:30]  Camper.  You never wanted me called a camper.  Thank you, by chick.  I know.  It's never f*** me in the f*** camper.  That's funny.  What's the next option?  The next one is the bad poem.  All right.  Rejection hotline.  Bad poem.  Yeah.  I, White House, by Josh.  As city soundscapes echo, echo in my mind, thoughts turn to why, why so many have been 
[02:39:00]  so unkind.  My unopened eyes see the vibrating, vibrating faces of the cruel, and I wonder why.  Why no friends in high school?  No solace then, fatty, fatty, fatty.  And surely not now.  I pretend, pretend, perform, but take no bow.  You cannot see me crying. 
[02:39:30]  Crying.  No one stirs, but I am dying.  Dying.  From the inside, deep inside, inside out, no ear pricks.  The American cycle.  Up as I shout, you are all wet, wet blankets smothering my soul, which shivers now as your  hearts blacken like coal. 
[02:40:00]  Coal.  I am never broken, and I will prevail, prevail, for I know when the wind changes, I will fail.  Sail, if you thought of me at all, mayhap, you'd think me a mouse, a mouse, but sail I  shall, guided only by the beacon of I, Lighthouse.  I, Lighthouse.  Wow. 
[02:40:30]  The poem.  It's like Mike Myers' character, not, uh, so I married an axe murderer.  Yeah, one of the options, uh, if you call the rejection hotline.  All right, and the final one?  And, uh, press three is...  Unrealistical?  Yeah, unrealistical.  All right, so, uh, basically, you meet a girl in the bar, you think you got her number,  and the girl really doesn't want anything to do with you, so then she gives you this number,  and this is one of the options.  Okay.  The person who gave you this number was probably just joking around. 
[02:41:00]  Later, you'll laugh about this together.  Lying in bed as a couple, kissing, massaging, nuzzling, ever so gently.  Yes, person who gave you this number did it on accident?  Was it digits off?  Try other possible combinations.  Was the handwriting blurry?  Aha!  Hmm?  The person who gave you this number obviously liked you on some level,  or they never would have even bothered to take the time to talk to you. 
[02:41:30]  Maybe this is their way of saying,  Hey, you, I'm scared.  I'm scared of committing to or even casually dating you,  because you are that intimidating and impressive.  Wow.  Cupid strikes again.  Love is so crazy.  Good luck, hot stuff.  That's pretty good.  That's real good.  That's a good concept, right? 
[02:42:00]  God, that would suck, though.  Yeah, some fat guy gets up the courage to ask that pretty girl for the number.  That cowardly whore.  Can't just tell him no.  And then it's not an 800 number or anything.  No, it's a 2-1-2 number.  Yeah, see?  So you would think, oh, boy.  All right.  It's local.  This is it.  Oh.  Should I?  Okay, I won't call.  I won't call today.  I'll wait.  I'll wait a day so I don't seem too eager.  I'll wait.  And now I'm not going to call, like, first thing the next day. 
[02:42:30]  I'll just wait a little long.  All right, it's time to call.  Now it's time to call.  Oh, let me see.  Okay.  Look, I'm calling on a portable phone.  A portable phone.  All right, let me dial.  Okay.  Oh, it's ringing.  It's ringing.  Yeah.  Help.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Say.  Thank you.  Totally destroying the nice flow that was there.  Okay, that's cool.  That was great.  Good one. 
[02:43:00]  Good one.  Good one.  Good one.  Good one.  Good one.  Because the impact of the whole thing.  Oh, my God.  Then I would have done this whole disappointment thing.  Well, yeah.  Well, yeah.  At that point, they would have answered because you said there that it was ringing.  Yeah.  And then you were ready to say hello.  I was like, huh?  And then that would have come on.  But it's not.  Hit the damn button!  Welcome to the New York City Rejection Line.  Brought to you by RejectionLine.com.  Yeah, sorry.  The bit's over.  Unfortunately, the person who gave you this number does not want to talk to you or speak  to you again. 
[02:43:30]  Was John at all responsible for that?  Who would like to take this opportunity?  Thank you.  Great.  All right.  Well, RejectionLine.  There you go.  I'm just laughing at the fun that I could have had listening to you.  You know something?  I must say.  Whenever we use that machine, it never works.  Because it could be A.  It could be B.  It works.  It works.  I'll say three times out of ten without a hitch.  Sometimes we've got to pot it down because then we don't know what's going to pop up. 
[02:44:00]  You know, all sorts of things could happen.  I think we need a better system for that.  I think we need a better system so it goes off without a hitch.  Because who knows what...  Ever.  Who really knows what B Metro means?  B Metro?  No, I'd be Metro.  See, that's a shortcut machine and it's labeled B Metro.  But if you push B, you get like news reports.  But if you push A, the B Metro becomes the shortcut.  Does it ever have to be in B?  Yeah, for like...  For what?  Something happens when it's in B. 
[02:44:30]  What is it in B?  Music.  For what?  For bits.  On what?  Where does it go?  On the computer.  Oh, when it's...  It's the computer.  When it's B, we go to the computer.  When was the last time we went to the computer for sound?  Well, when Napster was still around, we went to B a lot.  Shouldn't it be in A all the time?  Usually it's in A.  Shouldn't a once in a blue moon when we go to the computer F up more so than that?  But shouldn't the F up fail like Ant?  What?  The problem is it's not labeled on the board. 
[02:45:00]  So you don't...  Every day you try to remember in your head what A is and what B is.  Where's Pete Johnson?  That's the problem.  Other shows switch it.  Oh.  That's...  Right.  So, but if it was labeled A is for shortcuts, not B Metro, and B is for computer, then it  would never be wrong, ever.  And then that bit would have killed my friend.  Oh, wow.  Don't take it so hard, camper.  There's always that 70s show.  I was making out with my girlfriend and some chubby Jewish guy shot her in the head. 
[02:45:30]  It's not Sam.  It's the son of Sam.  He's not doing it on his own.  It's a dog telling him.  A talking dog.  A dig and he goes with you when you explore.  Ed, what's going on?  I got that 70s or 80s show. 
[02:46:00]  Yeah.  Hey, that's not concrete in a bag.  It's my lunch.  Very personal and open.  That's hilarious.  Very good.  Let's take a break.  We'll come back.  We'll play a little What Do We Learn, I think.  All right.  Very educational.  And, oh, real fast.  The job's on tonight, 930 on ABC, Anthony.  Yes.  With Adam Farrar, our friend.  Look for the WOW sticker.  It's going to be in every freaking episode this year.  Yes, Sam?  It's that Today Show. 
[02:46:30]  It's not B.  It's A.  We need a hotline we can call when bits go bad.  So a hot, sexy girl can make us feel better.  I'm sorry.  Your bit went completely awry.  It was supposed to be A.  Alas, it was B.  Next time, I'm sure it'll just be comedic genius that comes out.  But you've got to suffer through these little setbacks.  So hang in there, camper. 
[02:47:00]  Hang in there, camper.  We're going to turn this thing around.  Keep your chin up.  I've got your tool bar up.  And we're going to turn this thing around.  You keep your chin up, camper.  I just can't wait to go home and watch that A.D. show.  Hey, it's Nancy Reagan and her two beautiful breasts.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Wow, a naked girl.  Hey.
