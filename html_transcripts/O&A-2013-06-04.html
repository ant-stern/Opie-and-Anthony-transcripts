<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts, Opie and Anthony, and Jimmy engaging in their usual vulgar banter.  Their planned guest, Doc Gooden, cancelled, prompting speculation and jokes about his reasons.  The death of Deacon Jones was briefly acknowledged.  Sports talk followed, covering the Indiana Pacers' loss and the Bruins' win. Opie then shared a story about returning a lost wallet to a seemingly ungrateful Columbia University student, sparking a discussion about good deeds and cynicism.  The conversation veered towards food, specifically Opie's dislike of soul food and a comparison of various ethnic cuisines.  Michael Douglas' denial that oral sex caused his cancer led to more crude jokes.  The hosts then launched into a furious, profanity-laced rant against the Cronut creator for their inability to obtain Cronuts despite promoting his business, comparing his actions to Apple’s artificial scarcity tactics.  They fantasized about violent retribution.

The show continued with a tirade against Mayor Bloomberg's anti-obesity campaign and bike-sharing program, focusing on the Brooklyn residents’ response of throwing trash on the bikes due to parking issues.  Various news items were briefly discussed: Kim Kardashian eating her placenta, rumors about Kanye West's sexuality, Justin Bieber's hat, a possibly hoaxed drone-plane near-miss, a viral child dance video, a parent letting their child beat up another, and an NBA player fined for saying "no homo."  Sam Roberts' first wedding anniversary at a wrestling event was also mentioned.  The overall tone remained highly informal, irreverent, and laced with profanity.

A significant portion of the show involved a discussion about social media (Vine and Instagram) and parenthood.  Jim Brewer, a guest, detailed his low-effort, yet surprisingly popular Instagram content featuring his "hand guy," while the hosts and Brewer shared anecdotes about raising children, dealing with their wives, and the challenges of parenting.  Jim Boone, another guest, revealed he was let go from SiriusXM, detailing the insulting low offer he received.  A heated discussion on gun control ensued, covering self-defense, gun laws, media coverage, and the Boston Marathon bombing.  Offensive language and hyperbolic statements were frequent.

Jim Brewer featured prominently in another segment, discussing gun control from his perspective, including his preference for semi-automatic weapons and frustration with restrictive gun laws.  He used the analogy of household rules and children's misbehavior to illustrate his point.  He also shared a frightening home incident where he felt the need to protect his family, and recounted his experiences at a shooting range and his disastrous honeymoon at the Rocking Horse Dude Ranch, including a bizarre massage experience at a bed and breakfast.  The segment briefly mentioned protests in Turkey and a police shooting, and included promotional announcements for Brewer's upcoming comedy special and tour dates.  Vulgar and offensive language and humor were prevalent.

The final segment revisited Jim Brewer's appearances, highlighting specific comedic bits from the day, including stories about raising children, an argument with Anthony, his honeymoon, and the bed and breakfast experience. The hosts discussed upcoming (and cancelled) guests like Dwight Gooden, contrasted with successful past interviews like Cal Ripken Jr.  The discussion focused heavily on the hosts' and guests' unhealthy eating habits and preferences, including a lengthy discussion of the Luther Burger and other fast food.  One host concluded with a self-deprecating discussion of his own unhealthy lifestyle and appearance.

[00:03:30]  This is the Opie and Anthony channel.  And now, a show the likes of which America's never seen.  So appalling, so offensive, yet so entertaining.  It's not your normal show.  Being from satellites in space down to you every single day.  What planet are we living on?  It's the Opie and Anthony show with Opie.  We're experts and we already know this is going to be great radio, so shut the fuck up.  And Anthony.  I live in a big house, I make a lot of money, and I fuck attractive girls. 
[00:04:00]  And little Jimmy.  I don't even like an hour opening.  I don't even like an hour opening.  It sounds like a little...  What?  Hey, dang over there.  Don't listen to dang over there.  Stop with that shit.  I know.  Here they are.  Why am I introducing these buffoons?  I'm William Shatner, goddammit.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Morning, everybody. 
[00:04:30]  Whoa, what was that?  Morning, everybody.  Is that better, Iraq?  All good.  All good in there.  Doc Gooden has canceled the Opie and Anthony show.  He's rescheduled. 
[00:05:00]  What's up?  What's up, Doc?  I was going to say that.  Fucking call me up.  I was going to go, hey, Doc, what do you got?  Your medical license or something?  Someone tweeted that they want to kill the person that showed Jimmy, Chip,  how to use the front-facing vine camera.  That's all you get now from Jimmy.  That's all you're going to get.  Yes.  Edgar.  So why did you cancel?  I reschedule.  So what?  We're in the rescheduled phase of the cancellation of the booking. 
[00:05:30]  Okay.  It's officially rescheduled.  Is he canceling everything on the platform?  But we don't have a date for the reschedule.  He's doing everything else.  Here?  Yeah.  In the afternoon?  So he's not going to come in the morning?  He's not coming.  Holy fuck.  He's not.  We're not going to talk to Doc Gooden.  No, no, no.  Let me go on the record.  Let's stop right now.  I'm going to go on the record right now.  We've been doing this a long time.  I've never seen Doc Gooden.  Let me say.  This book comes out today.  Yeah, come on.  I'm going to say we will get them because.  When? 
[00:06:00]  Oh, tomorrow?  It's a book.  It's a book.  They always come through with the books.  Yeah.  Even the publishers know radio is good for books.  Radio.  Then again, if he's doing radio.  Radio.  Radio.  Radio.  We'll see.  What time is he here tomorrow?  11?  We're still talking about it.  That's why he didn't come in earlier.  Oh, maybe he has blown us off.  That might be right.  Yeah, he's blown us off.  We've got other stuff tomorrow.  Oh, stop.  We're getting it.  Oh, stop already. 
[00:06:30]  Well, we found out Marino was his publicist.  Publicists don't usually throw themselves under the bus.  Did we find that out officially?  Yeah, I believe Roland on that one.  I don't believe anyone anymore.  No, that one I bought.  Oh, I believe what Roland is saying.  He believes to be true as well, but that was way too suspicious.  Whatever.  God damn it.  I only read like 30 pages, but I was enjoying his book very much.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Fuck. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah.  I'm glad I didn't read the whole thing.  I would have been so sore.  I think we'll get fucking Deacon Jones in here again before we get fucking.  We lost Deacon Jones overnight, huh?  Deacon Jones is dead.  Oh.  We talked to him in LA.  Yeah.  I use multi-blade.  Multi-blade.  That's from the odd couple.  He's doing a commercial with fucking Oscar.  It seems like he should have been older.  He was around a long fucking time.  74.  74.  That famous age I talk about.  A lot of guys died at 74. 
[00:07:30]  Jiminy Cricket.  I'm telling you right now.  Hey, the Pacers didn't come back and win that game last night, right?  All right.  All right.  All right.  What's that?  Uh, basketball.  Well, sometimes, I mean, uh, the Heat were just fucking dismantling them.  And I'm like, you know what?  I'm not staying up for this.  I'll get an extra hour of sleep.  But sometimes when I do that, I wake up with the big surprise.  Oh, my God.  Oh, the biggest comeback in NBA.  Right, right, right.  I'm like, fuck.  They lost by 23.  They did, right?  Yeah. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah, it looked shitty.  That's pretty fucking, that's a lot.  Yeah.  The Bruins killed the Penguins, too.  I know.  I saw that this morning.  I didn't watch that game.  I should have flipped over to that game.  So, uh, so what?  It's the Heat and the Spurs?  Yeah.  Oh, fuck.  The fucking Heat are going to win another championship?  Fuck.  Damn.  I read, uh, since the Pacers didn't win, now there have only been eight different teams  in the last 30 years to win a title.  Really?  Yeah, because the Heat and the Spurs have won in the last 30 years.  Spurs are an older team. 
[00:08:30]  Ray Mars.  I don't know.  They get any young guys since last year?  I don't know.  They got a couple.  Oh, fuck.  Is Tim Duncan still playing or is he done?  Tim Duncan?  He's playing.  Of course he is.  Oh, okay.  Um.  Fucking donut guy or something.  Oh, come on, Gomi.  You're killing me.  So, I told Anthony, but I'll tell the story to Jimmy so it's nice and fresh. 
[00:09:00]  I, uh, I got myself into a, uh, just a little situation yesterday.  A little situation.  I'm sitting around my house and my babysitter comes over to watch the kids for a little bit  So we can get the fuck out of the house and breathe.  I love being a father.  But I also love fucking getting away from it for a couple hours.  So you grab a babysitter just so you can fucking, like, leave the house for a little bit?  Do nothing.  Do nothing?  Maybe go to the gym, maybe jump on my bike, maybe just wander around.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Once or twice a week.  Just a couple hours. 
[00:09:30]  Just a few hours.  Get some fresh air.  My God.  Sure.  So if I watch another Max and Ruby, I'm going to fucking go insane.  Mars is laughing.  Max and Ruby.  Doesn't it panic?  I thought of you yesterday.  I held Bob Kelly's baby and it's this big.  Yeah.  And I'm like, it's fucking terrifying.  Like, you go home and, like, you got two of them.  I'm like, what would you, I would fucking just panic.  Just constant panic.  I gave it back after 30 seconds.  I was like, he's beautiful.  Something's going to happen.  What do you do if he coughs a fucking...  Oh, God, it's a nightmare. 
[00:10:00]  Holy shit.  I hate holding other people's babies, but, you know, when they're yours, I guess it's a  little different.  I don't know.  We had big babies, too.  It just seems terrifying.  We didn't feel like we were bringing home one of those tiny little nuggets.  No.  Sorry.  Nugget.  A little nugget.  Ours, I don't know, we're a little on the longer, bigger side.  Yeah.  Nine pounds.  That's a big baby.  A little over nine for both of them.  So, baby says, shows up, and I'm sitting there, and she goes, she's young, too. 
[00:10:30]  I think she's like 20.  I don't know.  She could be anywhere from 20 to 22.  And she goes, ah, this wallet was in the cab.  So, I'm like, well, let's go through the wallet.  Give me that fucking thing.  I have no problem going through someone's wallet.  It's kind of exciting.  You get to learn about a person really quickly.  Yeah.  I probably shouldn't give too much personal information, but he had a Starbucks card, like five credit cards.  He had phone numbers just written on business cards. 
[00:11:00]  And it looks like he's some kind of really old student at Columbia University and all this shit.  No money in it.  So, I'm wondering if she took the money, because most people take the money before they return the wallet, right?  Yeah.  I guess they do, right?  They do.  Oh, fuck yeah.  Because then you go, ah, I don't know.  I found it like this.  It was on the fucking curb.  So, I'm sitting there, and I'm like, well, let's call the building, because I know his address, because of his license.  And it so happens he's within a cab ride of me, and I can't find a phone number for the building. 
[00:11:30]  Like, your building has a phone number, right?  I'm guessing it does.  It has to.  I call down sometimes.  Yeah, yeah, we do.  And my building has a phone number.  So, I'm like, all right, I'll call the building.  I'll get somebody there, and then they could alert the guy that we got his wallet.  Right.  I can't find a number for the fucking building.  And then I look up his name, and he's unlisted.  So, I'm sitting there, and now I'm thinking, I think it's my responsibility to return the wallet. 
[00:12:00]  So, you're feeling like a good Samaritan.  And these Twitter assholes, and I mean that lovingly, I wish you would have told me ahead of time that I could have just dropped it in the mailbox, because I guess you could do that.  I didn't know that.  What?  You just put the wallet in the mailbox, and they figure it out.  Oh, really?  A lot of people told me that.  I didn't know.  I figured everything would just fall out in the mailbox.  Yeah.  But I guess you'd do the right thing, tape it up a little bit, and fucking throw it in the mailbox, and then they'll look up the license, and they'll mail it back to the asshole. 
[00:12:30]  They send it back.  Yeah.  The asshole.  Oh.  Postage two.  But I'm thinking, if I lost my wallet in a cab, I hope someone would return it immediately, just because of the hassle of calling all the credit card companies and all that shit.  Mm-hmm.  I wouldn't even care if the money was gone.  I just don't want to go through the hassle.  Exactly.  So I'm looking around my house.  I'm like, I think I've got to go and return this wallet and be a good Samaritan.  So I jump in a cab.  It was a $20 cab ride, by the way.  Holy shit.  Because it was rush hour, and I can't say where. 
[00:13:00]  What part of the city?  Upper West Side, but way up.  Way Upper West Side.  Yes.  Yes.  After 110?  Yes.  Right around that area.  Wow.  You're brave.  You went into Harlem.  Okay.  I don't know.  I laugh at Harlem.  I bike around Harlem.  I might laugh at it.  Well, as long as the sun's up.  I don't laugh too much if it's getting dark.  Not as cocky as you do.  Oh, fuck no.  I know.  Opie and I am legend.  Fuck no.  I don't laugh as much.  Maybe a little giggle as I'm fucking peddling as fast as I can. 
[00:13:30]  Although no one bothers you really in Harlem, especially during the day.  What are you doing?  It's actually great people watching up there, man.  Anyway, so I'm in the cab and I'm almost feeling good about myself.  Like, wow, look at you doing something nice for once.  Look at you.  You're a good Samaritan.  So I show up at the building.  It's all awkward.  And there's a big fat fuck sitting in the lobby.  I go, you work here? 
[00:14:00]  He goes, maybe.  I go, well, do you or do you not?  I got a question.  The doorman?  Yeah.  He was an asshole, too.  Yeah?  I gave away the punchline.  But anyway, I go, he goes, what do you want?  I'm like, I found blah, blah.  I gave the name's wallet.  And then he just picks up the phone and calls the guy.  Oh, you don't want to maybe just talk to the doorman, huh?  See that episode?  Seinfeld?  It's hilarious.  The doorman?  Right.  Great.  But why didn't I just give the fucking wallet to him? 
[00:14:30]  I didn't need to meet the guy.  You should do that.  I'll tell you why.  Because he didn't seem like he would do the right thing with it.  He was an asshole immediately.  Why would?  I would have been weird if I'd leave it with him anyway.  I think part of it was, yeah, what is he going to do?  Because then, you know, he could just fucking be a bad guy and say, oh, look what this guy  just handed me.  Yeah.  For some reason, I had to meet the guy.  I don't even know why.  Because I didn't need a thank you.  I didn't need cash.  But I felt like I had to put it in his hand.  So I hear the fucking.  I hear him coming down the stairs and he shows up with this look on his face, not happy, 
[00:15:00]  not smiling, not doesn't even address me.  So I go, oh, we found your wallet in the cab.  You know, here it is.  And he goes, really?  Well, I just used the credit cards at a supermarket right around the corner.  I don't know.  I don't know what to tell you.  We found it in a.  I say it again.  You know, my babysitter found it in a cab and I came up here to return it.  Well, I just used this. 
[00:15:30]  You know, I just had my wallet around the corner in a supermarket.  I go, I don't need your fucking money.  Like, all of a sudden, I lost it.  I go, I don't need your fucking money.  I'm just trying to give you your wallet back.  Oh, what an asshole.  So he just grabs it out of my hand and he starts turning to walk away and I just reach out my hand like this, forcing him to shake my hand.  He doesn't say thank you.  What a scumbag.  So then I leave his building like, this is why I don't do anything nice ever.  Yeah. 
[00:16:00]  I'm serious.  This is why when the old lady falls on the fucking sidewalk, I turn and make believe I didn't see it.  As soon as you get involved, there's always a problem.  No good deed goes unpunished.  What a scumbag.  Dude, not a thank you, not a smile, not nothing.  He's just being accusatory toward me.  Like I'm involved in some weird fucking scam.  Like, you know, I took it out of his pocket.  Then I return it, what, and make a quick hundred or something for returning his wallet? 
[00:16:30]  What do you think happened with that?  Say he just used it around the corner and then it was in a cab.  What do you think happened?  Did he get pickpocketed and someone jump in a cab or did he have it in a cab and just fucking...  Well, then I'm wondering what the fucking...  What happened to his wallet?  Then I'm wondering how the babysitter was involved.  But then why would she tell me?  Right, she wouldn't.  It's probably not her.  Yeah, of course not.  She found it in a cab.  I go, I don't know what to tell you.  What a dick.  My babysitter found it in a cab.  I came all the way up here.  Just give it back to you.  You know what?  You did the right thing because even though he's a douche, it really is a good... 
[00:17:00]  It's just the right thing to do.  And I've had my camera return once and I was very thankful.  Did you go, give me it?  I did, didn't I?  And I punched you a woman right in her bad legs.  But sometimes you're going to get a dick.  You do it for you, not for them.  My first thought as I was leaving this building, man, I was thinking to myself, man, I got to start dressing better.  Oh, yeah, if the guy thinks you're fucking running some wallet thievery scam.  I don't dress well as far as, you know, my status in society. 
[00:17:30]  Maybe I should start dressing better.  Start dressing up a little bit.  Because this idiot thinks I'm involved in some fucking weird scam or something.  But he didn't even say thank you.  Nothing.  I can't comprehend.  How old was he?  I forced him to shake my hand knowing that would bother him.  How old was he?  Um, if I had to guess, late 40s maybe.  Did gray hair-ish in shape. 
[00:18:00]  Yeah, probably late 40s.  Didn't you want to say to him, like, are you really not going to thank me from coming here from fucking, from midtown and giving you a fucking wallet at my own expense?  I didn't know what to say.  That's just kind of shocking.  I was just, at that point I just wanted out of there.  Because I'm like, you're not involved in my life.  Unfortunately, these circumstances brought us together for a quick second.  I just wanted out of there at that point.  Fuck him.  But you know what?  You were curious as to who he was and what he was like.  And you realize he's just a dud.  Fucking asshole.  He's just a fucking asshole.  But the whole time with a cat, like, I'm like, I'm looking at the wall like, look at you. 
[00:18:30]  Oh, you.  I am good.  I'm good.  Look, see.  I'm being good.  I know I'm good.  And then you fucking end up going like, I'm never fucking going to do that.  But it's like, I mean, I was in a cab for like 15, 20 minutes.  I was stopping at every light because I was stuck in this fucking traffic.  I'll never take back a wallet again.  No thank you card had been sent. 
[00:19:00]  I didn't want money.  No.  Yeah, I guess a thank you I did want.  Of course you did.  That's fair.  Yeah, sure.  I couldn't believe it.  I can't believe it.  This is why.  You know, if you get involved with complete strangers, I just don't, I don't, I don't see the upside to it.  I have my friends.  Everyone else is an asshole.  That's how I go through life.  Did he look in the wallet when you handed it back to him?  He turned away quickly.  I was able to make him shake my fucking hand. 
[00:19:30]  That was my way of like, fuck you.  And then I'm thinking, what, is he now going to call the cops because he's suspicious?  Now I'm going to have to deal with that?  About what, though?  Who the fuck knows?  Was money missing?  There was no money in it.  I joked on Twitter I was going to take a Starbucks card for my taste.  Should have.  You got to get your taste.  So I figured, you know, if you knew the guy was, if you knew the guy was going to be  that big an asshole, what would you have done different?  I would take you would not have brought it back at all.  Oh, fuck. 
[00:20:00]  I would have threw it in the fucking garbage.  Not even a question.  Not even in a mailbox.  If I know what I know now, fuck him.  You got Velcro.  That sound.  Even though you don't bring it back.  If you knew it was him, you don't take, if you knew he was a dick, you don't take the  trip, but you still get it back to him.  Because again, it's about you.  It's not him.  He's a cunt, but you did a good thing.  So fuck him.  I would have put it on a sidewalk or something.  Let someone else deal with it.  Demagnetize all his credit cards.  That's a good idea.  Do that.  Send it back.  And it'll be like, oh, what happened here?  Right.  Hit Metro cards and a Starbucks card. 
[00:20:30]  That would have been, that would have been a nice little taste.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, maybe he's losing his mind.  You know what?  Maybe he's fucking, maybe he's, he's kept memory loss and he can't believe this happened  again.  And instead of thanking you, he's like, what's happening to me?  Why?  I just used this and now it's gone.  What is wrong with me?  Maybe he's just mad that he lives up in Harlem.  Maybe he's got a lump on his brain and he's fucking, he realizes that he's losing his life  quickly.  Yeah.  Don't try to make him a nice guy.  He was just an asshole.  I know.  I'm just kind of put a, you spin on a lump on the brain.  A lump on the positive. 
[00:21:00]  He lived on, he lived in a nice area.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Then you go east of there.  That's where, you know, Harlem is.  Oh.  Or, you know.  So there's upper west.  More of the, more of the Harlem as we know it is.  I see you got a picture of, uh, of the Seinfeld diner.  Yeah.  And then I walk.  Monk's.  Tom's.  Then I walked toward, uh, Masterdam cause I knew that there'd be some action there  cause I love fucking wandering around and people watching.  And, uh, all of a sudden I run into Tom's diner, the diner from Seinfeld.  I didn't, I knew it was up there somewhere.  Where is it?  So I took a picture. 
[00:21:30]  It's on my Twitter.  112th Broadway.  112th and Broadway.  So now you know about where I was.  I was a little west of there.  It'd be hard to narrow down the actual guide.  You could probably say what the building is and they still wouldn't find the asshole  in the building.  They shot that in Harlem all those years?  Or the internals were in, in, in a studio.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Exterior shot.  Just the exterior shot of the restaurant.  They didn't even shoot inside, did they?  I don't think, no, of course not, right?  Just the outside.  Well, that's just like Cheers.  Yeah.  In Boston, you go inside like, what the fuck? 
[00:22:00]  This isn't.  This isn't Cheers.  It looks different.  This isn't where everybody knows my name.  Right.  Yeah.  That was a set.  It was, they just used the exterior shot.  So that was my little fucking afternoon.  Then I just walked home from there.  It was kind of nice.  All pissed.  Saw a fucking, saw a drug deal go down.  Oh yeah?  Yeah.  It was pretty cool.  Hope you stopped it.  Yeah.  Did good Opie just go around thwarting crime?  Making a Vine video.  Dude, up there, they're their own fucking people, man.  Oh yeah.  I didn't, I didn't officially see a drug deal go down.  I should adjust that. 
[00:22:30]  The guy.  Citizens arrest.  Citizens arrest.  This guy, I've never seen a hat like this in my life with so much shit on it.  Really?  It was amazing.  Sparkling and fucking.  Pimpat?  Like Pimpat?  It, it, I don't, it was a, I'm, I fucking make a lot of money up here type  of hat and he's on a, on a phone just openly fucking yelling at this guy.  Like, I got your, your, how did he say it?  I got your stuff.  I'm right here.  You know, where are you?  Just screaming.  I'm like, Jesus. 
[00:23:00]  I was on the phone going, fuck you.  I just got my wallet back.  Some guy broke.  But yelling at the guy, like, you know, cause, cause the guy's late for, for his pickup  or something.  Apparently so.  Shenanigans going on up there.  Then I, then some hoochie mamas were walking around with no bras.  Hoochie mama.  Yeah.  That was nice.  There's probably some really nice, juicy, like Dominican.  It was nice.  Asses up in Harlem.  I'm telling you, I like a fucking, Dominican girls are sexy, dude.  Yeah.  Fuck yeah.  Nice, juicy fucking wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, wiggle. 
[00:23:30]  Plump get firm, plump get firm, plump get firm, plump get firm.  They know how to dress for the weather up there, man.  And that means wearing just about nothing.  Yeah.  And then you start going, you know, closer and closer to where I live and they're all just  buttoned up and fucking tight up there, man.  There's so much loosey goosey shit.  Dude.  I was just swaying.  It's amazing.  I was in a writing, the other CVS before I saw Colin's show.  It was in the village.  It was like, she's a Dominican or Puerto Rican girl.  And her fucking shorts was so tight. 
[00:24:00]  Tight and short.  And short.  That's what I'm talking about.  It looked like she just painted something onto her ass.  And I sound like an old man, but I was so fucking turned on.  I just wanted to cup it.  Yeah.  Good girl.  Yeah.  You're a good girl.  Let's go uptown and walk around, man.  I'm telling you.  Yeah.  They know how to dress properly.  They really do.  They're the wrong color for you, but you get to see some stuff up there.  What are you going to do?  Do you ever eat soul food?  I would try it once. 
[00:24:30]  I've only ever had it.  Yeah.  I hated it.  I don't know.  It just seems like it's all.  It's based on shitty food.  Right.  Like it's based on the fact that they got the bottom of the barrel.  The fucking lower end of the pig.  The fucking, you know.  They got the leftovers.  The leftover shit and had to make something of it.  Right.  Collard greens.  Is it collard?  Collard greens.  Collard greens.  Collard greens.  Yeah, those are green.  Collard greens.  It's a dick.  Arrested collard. 
[00:25:00]  Collard.  Collard greens.  Arrested greens.  You don't like collard greens, do you?  No.  They're horrendous.  I don't like cooked vegetables.  Really?  Mm-mm.  Well, we lived.  When we.  Wow.  Well, I guess that's my multi.  My three versions of me.  When I lived in Buffalo, there was a radio guy that was from Atlanta.  And he said, hey, man, I want to, I want to cook you a southern, southern fried fucking country fucking meal.  So we all went over there.  It was horrendous. 
[00:25:30]  Yeah.  And he was so proud of it.  And it wasn't that he was a shitty cook.  You could tell how I was prepared and stuff that he knew what he was doing with southern food.  It's all prepared the same way.  It was horrible.  It wasn't bad.  Oh, I hated it.  I think we went out and got pizza afterwards.  Your pork necks.  All that shit.  Pork necks.  I don't remember all the dishes anymore.  But it was a traditional southern meal that he cooked for everybody.  Yeah.  I know.  I remember collard greens was there.  It was horrible.  Yeah.  And like pig's knuckles and fucking just that shit that you wouldn't want to eat. 
[00:26:00]  Right.  Chitlins.  Chitlins.  Yeah.  We had a little of that.  See, I don't like, like, like, even like, I ate, like, gefilte fish.  I think it's a Jewish food.  Jewish food's terrible, too.  It's fucking, any type of hardcore ethnic food, except for like Italian, I just don't like.  Mexican.  I like some good Mexican food.  Oh, Mexican's fucking amazing.  No, most ethnic food is great.  There's only a few, actually, you got to push it out to the horrible category.  What's bad?  Jewish food sucks.  Jewish food's terrible.  Irish food, not that great. 
[00:26:30]  Irish food, predominantly English, Ireland.  Not that great.  Very bland, right?  Isn't good.  I know people yelling at their radios right now, but in general, not that great.  And then you got the southern dishes are horrible.  Poor southern dishes, yeah.  And you know what?  I'm not that big of a fan of Indian food, but I've never really known what to fucking order.  I will fucking get me some Indian food.  I don't know what to order, though, I guess.  That stuff ain't too bad.  That shit ain't too shabby.  Yeah.  Ba-boo! 
[00:27:00]  I don't know.  It's all Seinfeld today.  I'm fucking mad at that guy.  I would be, too.  What a scumbag.  You fucking do the guy a favor, you throw him a bone.  You're not supposed to expect anything, though.  Yeah.  Like, I didn't jump in a cab like, oh, wow, I can't wait to get that really nice, heartfelt  thank you with a smile.  You probably were expecting something of a, oh, hey, thanks, man.  Wow.  A little human contact or a human emotion, whatever.  Yeah, that old story where, you know, the guy's very fucking thankful, you leave thinking, 
[00:27:30]  you know, if the world was more like this.  Right.  If that little microcosm of society that we just had, you know, me going a little out of  my way to help somebody out with no reward in it from, you know, if we could all just,  I was thinking, and the guy's an asshole, he blows the whole fucking thing apart.  Maybe he was hiding something.  You think?  Did you go through it really well? 
[00:28:00]  Oh, yeah.  Is there like a Nambla membership card in there or some shit?  Nah.  That's my wallet.  Nah.  Damn.  But you're right.  I was thinking Rocky, that famous speech he did to the Russians.  You and me lost our wallet, and we can bring back the wallet to each other.  Yeah, the whole world can bring the wallets back and not be an asshole.  Yeah.  CNN's doing a piece on employees behaving badly. 
[00:28:30]  Wow.  You're going to see this kid, he's licking all the taco shells at Taco Bell.  What a scumbag.  I would bet a lot of fucking money those are old taco shells.  That they had to throw out for whatever reason, and he decided to quickly do that for a video.  I don't think they use those shells.  Yeah.  They look delicious.  No fucking way.  Then they have another guy with his feet in the lettuce, the shredded lettuce.  You motherfuckers.  Just standing there in the lettuce.  At what place?  There. 
[00:29:00]  Quickly, look.  There it is.  They just showed it.  And he didn't even take his shoes off.  That's pretty funny.  I mean, they aren't assholes, but that's what I would do.  Taco Bell.  If you can find the story, I think it's Taco Bell.  Fucking Taco Bell.  Would you rather the guy stand in the lettuce, the shredded lettuce with his shoes on or in his bare feet?  That's a tough question if you think about it.  There's the psychological angle and then the technical scientific angle. 
[00:29:30]  The shoes themselves, oddly enough, are probably more filthy and disgusting to have that shit in there.  But psychologically, the barefoot thing brings this weird, disgusting, almost gay thing to it.  I would have to go with the shoes on.  Yeah.  Take my chances.  There's not dog duty.  Right.  On the bottom of the shoes.  Or he's fucking in the bathroom and under the urinal is all wet and his shoelaces are hanging in there. 
[00:30:00]  Right.  Oh, it's just disgusting.  This guy in Atlanta said, I've never heard soul food isn't good.  You're kidding, right?  Yes, you have.  Shut it.  Hold on.  I'm right away going to go.  That caller, before we have him on, that caller that said that it was, he's an asshole.  Hello?  Yo, neat.  Hello?  Hey, man.  Come on, man.  Oh.  You don't like fried chicken?  Who doesn't like fried chicken? 
[00:30:30]  I love fried chicken, but it's everything around it.  Fried chicken's a crossover.  You can stop with the fried chicken.  Okay.  Do you like barbecue ribs?  Not so much, believe it or not.  I like barbecue ribs.  I'm not a big rib guy.  I'll eat them, but it's not one of my tastes.  I like a good rib.  All right.  Potato salad?  Love potato salad.  Now you're just doing things that everybody does at a barbecue.  Macaroni and cheese?  Love it.  Yay.  Dude.  So why didn't this guy in Buffalo fucking serve this shit?  Collard greens, pig knuckles, fucking ham hocks. 
[00:31:00]  But that's what we're talking about.  You're just talking about any barbecue on a Sunday.  This guy just set us up.  Of course we like fried chicken, potato salad, and macaroni salad.  Of course we do.  Fry that chicken.  Fry that chicken.  I've got a pan.  Now, sir, are you...  I'm so full, man.  I would try...  The chilins, chilins, and all that, man.  Turkey necks.  That's what we're talking about.  That's special occasions? 
[00:31:30]  Yeah.  Like, my family is like chilins maybe on New Year's.  What's special occasion?  I'm having the shittiest day of my life.  Let's get some fucking chicken necks and boil them down.  Nobody eats that shit, man.  You're watching fucking Roots and all that shit, man.  I used to eat chicken ass growing up.  Ham?  You don't like ham?  Yeah.  No, no one likes ham.  Of course not.  What a ham.  Yuck.  Oh, that's so ethnic.  We are ham, sir.  It's such an ethnic food.  This is a one-sided argument. 
[00:32:00]  Totally.  You like ham?  No, of course not.  Ew.  Icky.  Ham and pussy.  Yuck.  Oh, ew.  Of course we like ham.  Okay.  Those are the basics of soul food, man.  I don't know, man.  I think you're misrepresenting it.  I think there's some...  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Name some shit that you know we're going to be like, eh.  You're naming all the good stuff.  Like you said, maybe like turkey neck.  You might not, you know.  No.  Yeah. 
[00:32:30]  Do you like turkey wings?  Did you say turkey wings or chicken wings?  Turkey wings.  No, I hate turkey wings.  And I don't like the turkey leg, by the way.  It's way overrated.  Yeah, I'm not too much of a turkey guy myself.  White fucking meat.  That's it.  Chicken white meat, turkey white meat.  Period.  I tell you, the food...  You like string beans?  No.  I hate string beans.  I like a good string bean.  I like a good string bean.  No, because...  A good string bean.  As you eat string beans, it turns out like you have floss in your mouth.  That stringy shit that you can't break down. 
[00:33:00]  Oh, you don't like that stuff?  No.  That fucking vein, whatever the fuck it is.  Stuff that can make fucking pulp it up and make paper out of it or some shit.  Yes.  Yes.  It's very fibrous.  Do you know what sounds like it would be very tasty right now?  I'm thinking of Boys in the Hood.  There's a scene where Larry Fishburne, when they go and it's fucking Compton or whatever,  and there's a barbecue.  And I would love to go to a black person's barbecue right now and just eat.  Yeah?  You did. 
[00:33:30]  Didn't you go to Patrice's every year?  Yeah, yeah.  I'm saying like right now, I'm thinking of this food right now, and that sounds fucking...  Because black people at a cookout really have good food.  Yeah?  Really have good food.  Yeah.  Like, I would love that.  I'm very hungry.  Cook out.  All right, hold on.  Usually ends in some form of gunfire.  Well, yeah.  I'm not saying I would enjoy that.  Yeah, leave before the gunfire.  We got a situation.  Jefferson is also from Atlanta, and he's on the phone with Neat.  Jefferson, what do you think of soul food?  Listen, people, if you're coming down to the South, you can eat fried chicken and all 
[00:34:00]  your normal stuff, but all that hog malt, pickled pig feed, that's just shit food.  Nobody down here eats that crap.  Exactly.  I agree with that.  All right.  But that's what we were talking about, sir.  We weren't talking about the fried chicken.  I was talking about traditional soul food.  Yeah, yeah.  Not all the stuff that people find good.  That's not traditional soul food.  Fucking hog knuckles.  Yeah, fuck that shit.  Hog knuckles.  I like this guy.  Fucking chicken feet.  Pickled chicken feet.  What the hell is that?  I don't know. 
[00:34:30]  Fucking sprinkled ground fucking turkey beaks all over your food.  Oh, that's one of them.  Oh, you ain't never had no ground turkey beaks?  What?  No, I haven't.  I haven't.  Here's a soul food.  Oh, possum assholes.  You got to get some possum assholes.  They look like that calamari.  You got to saute that.  Saute that around in a brown sauce.  Lots of butter and brown sugar.  Woo, possum assholes.  You put that in a brown sauce.  That's terrible.  I don't want possum assholes.  Woo, you ain't been living unless you taste possum assholes. 
[00:35:00]  Tastes like calamari.  Mmm.  I think a soul food dish that everybody might not agree with is probably like on fried okra.  Like I hate that.  Squirrel tail salad.  Squirrel tail salad.  You never had none of that?  Well, no.  He nailed it.  Okra.  Okra.  That's another one of those fucking things we ate in Buffalo that day as a traditional soul.  Okra?  What is that?  Okra is brutal.  She has a good show.  Brutal.  Okra sucks.  What is it?  Like fucking lettuce?  No.  I don't even know what it is. 
[00:35:30]  Is it like broccoli, Rob?  It's almost...  I like a good broccoli, Rob.  Ugh.  It's...  I don't do a shit job describing it, but...  It's bitter.  Yeah, it's terrible.  Like the guy you brought the wallet back to.  Yeah.  What'd you say it's like?  Neat.  It's like a fucking...  I don't even...  It's like a vegetable.  It looks like a pepper, but it's not a pepper.  And you cut it up, and then you like fry it up or stew it or whatever you're gonna do.  But I don't know the truth.  I hate this shit.  Yeah, it's horrible.  It's real slimy when you cook it. 
[00:36:00]  It's horrible.  Okra's horrible.  There's...  Almost like a...  It's almost similar somewhat to a squash, I would guess.  Maybe a smaller vegetable.  Yeah.  But besides that, man, everything else, fucking rice, comes from good vegetables.  Rice.  Rice, yeah.  Don't try to claim that all that that you mentioned is just soul food.  That's everybody's barbecue.  Yeah, you can't put rice and ham into the soul food category.  I thought they was having a barbecue.  I said, Lord, it's a fire. 
[00:36:30]  They're far.  It's a bomb.  All right, boys.  Let's check it out.  Thank you, buddy.  All right, man.  Thank you, buddy.  I got bronchitis.  So, Michael Douglas.  Oh, boy.  I guess his wife got to him, huh?  No shit.  That's what this is about, but most people aren't saying that.  But basically, now Michael Douglas is saying he's denying that oral sex gave him cancer.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:37:00]  And Andrea Pizer is really mad at him today.  What is Andrea Pizer mad at?  She wrote a whole article about it.  About?  That Catherine Zeta-Jones should fucking run from this guy.  Really?  Oh, really?  You know, she's nuts, right?  She's got what they call the bipolar, I guess.  Oh, exactly.  So, I guess Michael Douglas has to deal with that.  It's okay for him to deal with that, but it's not okay for her to deal with the fact  that he said that he might have got cancer from oral sex.  No, you said. 
[00:37:30]  Yeah.  But the thing is, you know, supposedly a sex addict, so it's not absolutely pinned  on her, but that's what everyone thought.  And that's what she said.  And that's what she said.  Behind closed doors, she said, are you fucking kidding me?  Now everyone thinks I have a diseased pussy.  Uh-huh.  Oh, that was dumb of him to say when you're married.  Like, what are you doing?  Oh, my God.  Who cares?  No one needs to know how you got it.  How'd you get it?  I don't know.  I smoked.  Yeah, yeah.  Why'd you get it?  I ate a lot of pussy. 
[00:38:00]  Yeah.  And one of them was diseased.  Oh, have you met my wife?  My lovely wife.  Fucking typhoid Mary twat.  Exactly.  Her pussy sneezes.  So he's in major damage.  Patient zero pussy.  He's in major damage control.  Ah, good for him.  His public relations team.  Man, it must be nice to have a public relations team.  Yeah.  Went into damage control mode Monday, insisting the actor never said he contacted throat  cancer from oral sex.  Pictures of him licking his wife's box in the paper. 
[00:38:30]  Hey, look, it's great stuff.  No, there's this circle of his tongue on a pussy with a line through it saying, like,  don't do this.  You have to talk about, do you eat pussy now or they won't insure you if you do?  I love this line.  He wants to make it very clear.  He never said that was the particular cause of his particular cancer.  Douglas, publicist Alan Burry, told the Daily News.  Yeah, well.  Alan Burry?  That's his wife going, you get out there and you make it very clear. 
[00:39:00]  People are like fucking walking on the other side of the street when Catherine Zeta-Jones  comes by, not wanting any of those fucking pussy spores on you.  Man, so.  That's cray cray.  So now he's denying it, which means just more bullshit.  Whatever.  The hard partying and smoking and drinking and whatever the fuck else he did.  Wouldn't you attribute it to that sooner than you would licking box? 
[00:39:30]  Probably.  Yeah.  I would.  Probably.  I do like licking a good box.  Like a good box?  Like a good string bean?  Some good broccoli rabe?  I love a good box.  Even a bad box I'll take.  No.  Bad.  No.  Bad box?  What do you mean bad box?  Yeah.  Just, I don't know what a bad box.  I just, I like a good box.  Let's just say that.  I like a good box.  Bad box is a little rough.  Man.  Yeah.  A little rough.  Everything in there.  Like working it.  Like a fucking, like the Wizard of Oz working that fucking machine. 
[00:40:00]  Hands, face.  Get everything in there.  Whoop, whoop.  I'm like a one man band.  Symbols are clapping.  Juggling.  Boy.  Do I like putting in the effort.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's fun.  It's like a fucking, it's like one of those shake hand games at the fucking fair.  You know?  See how high you can get the thing?  It's good.  It's like working.  Yeah.  Just gotta keep going.  She's almost there.  Almost there.  Stay on target.  Almost there. 
[00:40:30]  Stay on target.  You really do have to stay on target.  Gotta try to figure out the combination.  Yeah.  Sometimes.  I may need a hormone because my nipple play, Dr. Steve said.  I haven't talked to him, but I think like, because when you do that, it releases a hormone  in your body.  And, uh, cause I like my nips played with.  And I'm like, I wonder if I don't have enough of this one hormone.  Oh, no.  You think?  No, you just take it.  Like, it does something when I'm getting my fucking dick played with or whatever.  I play up my nipples.  It zones me out.  It makes me feel good.  Any type of, uh, I say hormone. 
[00:41:00]  Whore.  Or hormone.  I don't know.  Uh, but, but any type of that therapy, that type of therapy or something always fucks  you up, doesn't it?  Does it?  I don't know.  Doesn't it like psychologically do something and physically you get some kind of shit going  on?  Maybe you'll get like fucking develop teen acne or something or grow tits or something.  I don't know.  I'll find out, but I gotta talk to him about it.  Cause it's like supposed to be, uh, ah, yeah. 
[00:41:30]  You could take it like a nasal spray, but I'm wondering if it won't make me any of my nipples  played with anymore.  No, just, you just like your nipples being played with.  I think that's.  No, but it zones me out, dude.  It really does.  It's a weird thing.  Yeah?  Yeah.  You get like a little kitty.  You're on your back.  Yes!  Yes!  Like catnip?  It really is.  All right, so enjoy it.  It comforts me.  No, but it's distracting cause I can't use my hands.  Like, I'd rather be fucking, you know, get one on her shitter, one on her tits.  Oh, man.  You know, grab a tit, finger a shitter, call it a day. 
[00:42:00]  You gotta work that thing.  I need more arms.  I need to be like Dr. Octopus.  Yeah.  It's great.  Like you're working a backhoe.  Just fucking all kinds of levers and buttons and dials and switches.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Gotta get in there.  Nice.  I'm busy tweedling.  You're tweedly-deedling.  Tweedling.  And I have a deep asshole itch that has me concerned.  Still?  Yeah.  Do you think it's from the Neosporin running down the crack of your ass?  Might have been, but I didn't use it yesterday.  Now I'm like, oh my God, do I have fucking colon cancer?  Oh my God, you have an itchy ass, Jim. 
[00:42:30]  I know, but I'm clean.  I dug my finger in a good two feet today.  That's why.  It's immaculate.  That's why.  You stick your finger all the way into your asshole to clean it properly, and you probably  fucking sliced it with a nail or something.  Yeah, maybe it's a road.  Now it's infected.  Ow.  Oh, I wonder.  That area doesn't fucking heal quickly.  Now it doesn't itch.  There's so much dirt.  You can't have a cut near your asshole.  Fuck.  I would imagine that would take forever to heal.  An anal fissure.  Right.  I want to talk about being infected. 
[00:43:00]  You know how you've got to keep a wound clean?  It's like, let me just throw shit in this one.  That is a horrible place for a wound.  Imagine having a cut on your arm and then just wiping shit into it every day.  It would fucking get infected.  How does your asshole fight that whole thing?  That must be a hell of a battle going on back there.  Really?  That's like Braveheart going on in your ass with the fucking, your white corpuscles and  shit bacteria.  Of course.  It would take forever.  I literally am thinking that though.  I'm panicking. 
[00:43:30]  I'm like, I got cancer.  But I'm like, no, maybe it's just a roid.  Oh, man.  Maybe I just sat too long.  I take long shits.  Yeah.  Were you pushing too hard?  Sometimes, yeah.  Oh, shit.  Sometimes, yeah.  I'll really strain and struggle.  I hope it's just a roid.  Yeah, I'm sure.  Freaking me out.  Yeah, you're fine.  I hope.  Fuck it.  We're all going to die anyway.  I know, but you don't want your asshole taking out first.  That's true.  I want to die with my anus intact.  Fucking pop it out with a melon baller. 
[00:44:00]  Yeah.  God.  It's terrible.  You guys want to try the new Dunkin' Donuts sandwich?  What is it?  You want to try it?  I mean, no.  Is Roland into this?  I don't think so.  I think it's too white trashy for Roland.  Roland likes his cuisine.  Everyone's trying to get that fucking sandwich.  Get the big one that...  Well, basically, it's a glazed donut.  Like the cronut?  Glazed donut breakfast sandwich with fried eggs and bacon in the middle.  A glazed donut. 
[00:44:30]  Roland, what do you think of this thing?  This can't be you.  It probably tastes good, though.  This can't be you.  You think Dunkin' Donuts I don't like?  You don't like the donuts, though?  No, the donuts are great.  They're all right.  You know what?  I used to like a big cup of fucking Dunkin' Donuts coffee.  Very light and sweet.  I love their coffee, and the rest of their food can go to hell.  Yeah, I don't like their shit, either.  I don't like their donuts.  I haven't liked their donuts in years.  Oh, dude, I love Dunkin' Donuts.  That Krispy Kreme is some good shit.  I've never been to Krispy Kreme, though.  I've seen a good rack.  When they're fresh.  Oh, yeah, when the light's on, they have a light on, you know it's hot off the press. 
[00:45:00]  You can eat a whole dozen.  Oh, it's nice.  This is the new chicken sandwich.  Remember KFC got all the buzz last year because they made a sandwich, a bacon sandwich with  chicken instead of bread?  And the bread was the chicken.  Right, and it's horrible for you.  Yeah.  So this is Dunkin' Donuts being like, well, if we make a sandwich that will kill people.  Right, the things that are more dangerous to eat, that's the thing that catches on.  Yeah, these people, these companies are trying to make sandwiches that will kill you. 
[00:45:30]  This will kill you.  It's a glazed donut with bacon and eggs on it.  Can I Google the burger?  It's not many calories, by the way.  It's only 360.  I thought it'd be higher.  You're kidding, right?  No.  360, that's it?  Yeah, it should be way more, right?  Of course.  The donut's got to be more than 360.  That's what they're saying in the paper.  20 grams of fat, 360 calories.  They probably used eight whites.  Yeah, imagine that.  Make it healthy.  That's weird.  How is that only 360 calories?  Uh, yeah. 
[00:46:00]  I'm not sure.  Should I not know you, the one didn't fall off?  It's less than the 390 calories for the turkey sausage sandwich it recently introduced for  people looking to eat better.  It's probably just because it's eggs.  It's only got two strips of bacon on it.  And it's a glazed donut.  But, I mean, still, it's still...  I don't like the idea of having something that sweet.  Although you do eat French toast and stuff with them.  Oh, French toast is so much.  Why not make a French toast and then put the eggs in that and make that a sandwich?  That sounds good. 
[00:46:30]  Hey, why don't you open a place?  All right.  Or in between the cinnamon bun.  The cinnabons?  Cinnabons.  Cinnabons are such a great idea when you smell them.  And then after two bites, you want to just fucking start puking because it's so sweet.  It is delicious.  All 360 calories, though, are the worst possible kind of calories you can put inside of you.  Yeah, that's true.  Man.  Yes.  So, Cronut.  Where's our Cronuts?  I'm going to have to wait in line tomorrow.  Oh, boy.  They're just not coming.  No, he's not giving... 
[00:47:00]  Gooden and Cronuts are not going to be on the show.  No, but the Cronut guy stopped giving away free Cronuts.  That son of a bitch.  Fuck the Cronut guy.  I say fuck him.  Fuck the Cronut guy.  Yeah.  You fucking get back.  Get back.  He's making you wait on line, though?  Yeah.  We don't want Roland waiting on line so we can enjoy a Cronut.  Because he said...  Fuck him.  Fuck him.  If he does the list, which I saw the list, he'll be out of business just making free Cronuts.  Once the Cronut craze ends, he's going to be fucking begging.  That's right.  And we're going to tell him, fuck off.  That's right. 
[00:47:30]  Take your Cronut and blow.  Remember A.J. Clemente?  Right.  Exactly.  Put the Cronuts in the same fucking category.  The Cronut news broadcast.  That's what he was.  I'll be able to get the Cronuts this week, though.  I mean...  The fact that a national radio show has to wait a week to get these...  Fuck this guy.  Yeah, Cronut, you douche.  That really annoys me.  He should have had you come in the first day and go, yeah, I'll make you a couple.  I appreciate you guys talking about it on the air.  Right.  But I guess he's got enough coverage, so fuck this guy.  A jelly Cronut!  Yeah, we don't need these Cronuts. 
[00:48:00]  Roland has been talking about these for weeks.  Exactly.  The rest of the media, like, just got on it.  This guy's a twat.  Fuck him.  I don't care about his dumb fucking stroke-inducing food.  Fuck him.  Make a turkey sandwich, you cunt.  You're killing everyone.  His little things are delicious.  Good for him.  So is pussy.  Sell me one of those.  I'll wait online.  Sell me a fucking asshole with a nice tinkle smell in it.  That's what I like.  I hate this guy.  Yeah.  I hate him.  I don't even want a Cronut.  I can't even.  Yeah, I don't want it.  I refuse to eat one. 
[00:48:30]  Fuck him and his Cronut.  I'm annoyed for you.  You've been talking about this shit dick all this time.  You can't stand in line, Roland.  Oh, fucking drop.  I hope his place burns.  No, it's delicious.  It is good.  I know.  Why are you worried?  But fuck him.  Why are you worried?  Fuck him.  He's treating you bad.  He's a douche.  He's a foodie douche.  It's imparious.  Even if he charged for them.  Even if he said, look, I can only make X amount of these.  And you're right.  He can't go out of business because then every asshole in the media will be down there. 
[00:49:00]  Hey, I work for WPIX.  Can I get 80?  Fair enough.  Paying for him is okay.  It's not a money issue.  In fact, this guy couldn't sneak you in that first day.  I got a lot of cronut orders.  Really?  I hope you grab your chest and fall face first into your cronut maker.  Fucking asshole.  Fuck him and his new delicious hip treat.  I can't wait until somebody steals it and calls them cronets.  C-R-A-H-N-I-T-S.  And they're cheaper and better. 
[00:49:30]  And then this fucking cunt has to sue them.  Yeah.  Stop using the cronet moniker.  Oh, I hate them.  I hate this cuck sucker.  I forgot they existed.  Yeah.  The only reason I know they exist is because of Roland.  Yep.  And this guy won't let you sneak in the back and make you wait online?  Fuck him.  I had a cronut and a croissant on Sunday.  How long would you have to wait online tomorrow to get our cronuts?  Because I waited on three calories.  How long?  What?  How long would you have to wait online tomorrow? 
[00:50:00]  I waited like an hour and a half.  No.  What are you doing?  No.  I get the addiction because I'm an addict too.  But fucking, you gotta stop.  You're fucking, you know, you gotta, you gotta cut it out.  Cut it out.  You're hurting yourself.  It was a nice day.  I know.  I understand.  Taking the village.  You waited an hour and a half to eat a cronaut?  To get the fucking treat of some French jizz bucket.  Oh, look at my treats that I have made.  I have made the treats for everyone.  I have made the treats for two people. 
[00:50:30]  Two people can enjoy my treat.  Treat.  Oh, I hope there's a fucking power outage and then cronuts just explode when they're not sold.  You think he's feeling real good about himself?  Oh, you know what I'd love to do?  Because he's got the latest hip treat.  I'd love to trip him with a fucking, with a whole big schnook of cronuts.  Whatever that fucking douchey cook plate is called.  It's a schnook.  A schnook?  Yeah.  And he has a floor full of cronuts.  And then I could run in with my big heavy shoes.  You gotta let that out. 
[00:51:00]  You gotta let that out.  Step on him.  I hate this guy.  This dumb cart.  Should we get the cronaut guy on the phone?  No, he's too busy.  He's too busy making cronuts.  He can't talk.  Let's try to work this out.  Yeah, I could see if he's available.  Fuck him.  Fuck him is right.  Talk to him.  Yuck.  Dominique.  Of course.  Why wouldn't it be?  Is that really his name?  Of course.  Everybody, there are not many cronuts left.  Let me put a cone out on the sidewalk that will represent where the cronut line end. 
[00:51:30]  Thank you.  You are shit ass out of luck.  No cronut.  Only super customer.  None for the radio.  C'est la vie.  None for you.  Fuck him.  Fuck him.  Fuck him is right.  I want to tie him up and then fucking make him watch as I fuck the hole in every cronut 
[00:52:00]  he has on his truck.  Yeah.  There's an article.  Oh.  Why wouldn't there be?  I hope they found something bad in a cronut.  Even celebrities don't get special privileges.  CNN anchor Anderson Cooper tried to get an order for his birthday but was denied because  of high demand from the public.  Hugh Jackman, on the other hand, knew the protocol and reportedly waited in line for his cronuts.  They want ones with chocolate smeared in the hole.  But no, that's this guy being like, hey, these are so hard to get, no one gets them.  Even the mayor's office asked for like 60 and he said no. 
[00:52:30]  60?  Yeah.  This guy's an idiot.  But the mayor's office, they're supposed to eat well over there, aren't they?  Why isn't he churning out enough cronuts?  Yeah.  Because when you want to make a certain bash, though.  He's an idiot.  You can make more.  Get a bigger oven, you cock.  Right.  How about you get another whole cronut making set up?  Get bigger mixing bowls.  Right.  What are you doing?  The quality could go down, though.  Make two batches.  The quality going down.  Yeah.  Get there earlier.  Right.  Shut up.  And then you wouldn't be talking about it.  Yeah, you would. 
[00:53:00]  No, you wouldn't.  It's like the Apple thing with the iPhone.  Every year you talk about it.  She and a bad old cronut at that.  Wouldn't you just double the recipe?  Exactly.  Jesus.  How long is it as the cronut flies?  Limit supply and you create demand.  Cool.  Well, I forgot he existed until it came up again today.  I hope he drops dead.  So do you want a cronut?  They want chocolate smeared all over the phone.  Any promise?  Representing the shit, Jim.  No, no, I understood.  That was a good one. 
[00:53:30]  And today his new cronut flavor comes out.  What's a new flavor?  Yes.  What flavor?  I don't know.  That's how I'm excited to go down and see.  Oh, God, Roland.  This guy's making...  He's making a bitch, Eddie.  Let him go.  Let him go.  Let him go.  Fuck him.  Right.  He's annoying people by making this false fucking...  I'll be a bitch.  Yeah, you're being a cronut bitch.  Get something else.  There's got to be another thing that's...  How big are they?  They're like a little donut.  It's donut size?  Yeah, but so good.  What's the cream inside?  What does it taste like?  Heaven.  But what kind of cream is it?  It's like a vanilla type cream. 
[00:54:00]  It's so good, though.  Yeah.  When you bite into it, you're like...  Really?  I'm sure they're good.  Is that like an orgasm for you?  Yeah.  I'm sure they're good.  I'm so angry with this cronut guy.  Dude, I've never wanted anybody who I haven't met to die so badly.  Fuck him.  He makes 200 a day.  That's it?  That's it.  What an idiot.  He doesn't want to fucking...  What does he think?  Like, this whole thing's going to be hot three months from now?  Wouldn't you just be pumping out cronuts left and right?  I can't wait until fucking December comes. 
[00:54:30]  No one's going to give a fuck.  No one's going to give a fuck by September.  And this guy's riding around on a bike tossing cronuts or passersby.  Have a cronut for free.  We used your father's trucks to bring down the cronuts.  If there's a cronut on my table, I'll know we have a deal.  He doesn't understand how this world works.  Everything's about going viral.  He went viral with the treats.  So you've got to fucking make as many as possible for the next couple months.  Because it's going to go away.  The next thing's going to be right around the corner. 
[00:55:00]  And then he's going to have no line out there.  What a dummy.  He might not be able to make more.  Yes, he can.  You can figure it out.  You can make more of anything.  I don't know.  If it's a hot thing, you just...  Make a dumb cronut.  Yeah, you fucking double the fucking batter.  Oh, he trademarked the word cronut.  If history has taught us anything, it's that you can make as many cronuts as you need.  Words to live by.  Yes.  But he can only make 200 cronuts.  Now who's being naive? 
[00:55:30]  Michael, senators and mayors don't order large things of cronuts.  His name is Luca Brazzi, and he makes cronuts for my father.  Luca Brazzi held a gun to his head, and my father said that his brains or cronuts were  going to be all over the contract.  Ah, shit.  This fucking guy.  Before we move on from food.  Johnny Fontaine never gets that cronut. 
[00:56:00]  It's delicious.  It'll be perfect for him.  God, Father.  I need a cronut.  He only makes 200.  I can't get it cron.  Tom, you can act like a chef.  Not a joke.  Well, the stupid mayor is going after some more shit, and he's spending our fucking money.  That's what's pissing me off.  Now.  Bloomberg opened up a new front in his war on obesity, taking aim at sweetened teas, sports 
[00:56:30]  drinks, and fruity beverages.  There's a whole campaign out there.  What is this?  A whole $1.4 million ad campaign by the city health department will warn people to choose  healthy drinks, like water, seltzer, and fat-free milk to quench their thirst.  Quench your thirst with fat-free milk.  No.  You honestly think spending $1.4 million on an ad campaign is going to make people go,  you know what?  Instead of that fucking, I don't know, lemonade, I'm going to get a seltzer? 
[00:57:00]  Get the fuck out of here.  You know what's nice after you're in the hot sun, and you're tired, maybe you've been jogging  a little bit, a nice, tall glass of milk.  Fat-free.  What the fuck is that about?  Fat-free.  This guy's an idiot.  You can't even have the regular milk, which does taste good every once in a while if it's  ice cold.  But yeah, and it's got to be ice cold, and you can't be out in the heat.  It's just wasting more money.  No one's going to change the way they order their fucking drinks, because they see a dumb 
[00:57:30]  ad.  A 20-ounce lemonade delivers 67 grams of sugar.  Yeah, we all know that.  That's so good.  And it's 260 calories.  Yeah, we all know that.  Nice iced tea.  But on a hot summer day, you're going to go for the lemonade instead of what?  The fat-free milk or seltzer.  Hey, this is great iced tea.  Isn't that unbelievable?  It is.  That's a Bloomberg.  Wasting our money.  Yeah.  People aren't going to reach for fat-free milk, because you throw a commercial on TV. 
[00:58:00]  Oh, God.  People know that they're drinking shitty stuff.  Yeah.  It tastes good.  Especially on a hot day.  Have a nice tall glass of milk of magnesia.  It's a nice chalky fucking milk of magnesia.  You're going to try to convince people that seltzer is tasty?  Seltzer.  Yeah.  Seltzer.  Yeah.  I want seltzer.  I love the fact that Bloomberg's bikes now, people are throwing garbage on them in Brooklyn.  Why?  Because these fucking bike racks, they take up a half a block.  And this cunt just doesn't care that it takes up all these parking spaces. 
[00:58:30]  Yeah.  He doesn't give a fuck.  He's a spoiled rich kid.  He doesn't have to deal with traffic.  Every inconvenience.  Well, people are tired of this shit already in Brooklyn.  They're throwing garbage on the bikes.  Good.  Wow.  I love it.  Yeah.  Well, his whole goal is to take away as many parking spaces as possible so they can buy  more tickets.  And lanes and everything else.  But no one fucking takes them on.  We all just accept it.  I hate them.  Because those bike racks didn't have to take away fucking parking spaces. 
[00:59:00]  You could have put them on the sidewalk.  Of course.  Well, that's what they do around Central Park.  They're not taking up spaces over there.  They put a whole big rack in where I fucking come into work in the morning.  Really?  I drive up.  It's, I guess, 40.  Where do I come up?  47th.  Right before park.  There's apparently like.  And it's.  Now, a lane is gone.  Oh, really? 
[00:59:30]  A lane is fucking gone.  So that when you get behind a truck now, and it's going,  And then you're behind him doing three miles an hour as he launches through 50 gears.  And you see that little green light now turning red where I would have been able to go around  him.  Right.  Now it's a bunch of bicycles.  Cocksucker.  It's so, so irritating.  Hate it.  Fucking so irritating. 
[01:00:00]  Mmm.  Okay.  How much is a cronut?  Does a cronut go for these days?  What's the market price of a cronut?  How much?  Five bucks.  Five dollars per cronut?  So this dumb cunt only makes a bourbon in it?  He only makes a thousand dollars a day.  And he's not even making the thousand because he's got to spend money to make them, obviously.  He's only bringing in a thousand dollars a day on his cronuts?  What an idiot.  Five dollars for a cronut?  Ain't got no bourbon in it?  I know that's a lot of money for a lot of people, but that is stupid. 
[01:00:30]  If you got the hot fucking treat and you're only bringing in a thousand bucks a day.  God damn, that's a good cronut.  Huh?  His other treats are really good.  What other treats?  He has this caramel thingy that's delicious.  So do you have to stand in line just for cronuts?  You can get other things, right?  Yeah, yeah.  He has a whole kitchen.  Is there a separate line in case you just want something else?  Yeah.  What if you just want something else?  Just go in.  And then go in there and go, oh, I want a cronut.  You know what?  Why doesn't he take all the time and effort and resources that he takes to make all the 
[01:01:00]  other stuff and just make fucking more cronuts?  Right.  When you blow out everything else, fuck everything else.  I'll get back to that shit in a month or two.  I am so mad that I am in a situation now where I have to say the word cronut.  I hate it, too.  I hate even having to say the word.  Yeah, it's terrible.  Yeah.  Cronuts.  All right.  Why don't we break?  Yeah, I'm going to eat my cronut.  Two things when we get back.  I have a cronut.  I want to talk about Justin Bieber's hat.  You saw it, right?  Yeah.  Okay.  Oh, I haven't seen this.  No, don't even show the guys.  All right.  Okay.  Let's do this cold. 
[01:01:30]  I want to talk about Justin Bieber's hat and that two-year-old doing the Beatles song  with his pops there.  Oh, I didn't see that either.  It's aight.  Nice.  But then again, he's only two.  That's pretty much the viral video today, so we'll take a look at that.  The Opie and Anthony Show will return in a moment.  After all, millionaires have to piss, too.  Now, The Opie and Anthony Show continues. 
[01:02:00]  Metallica released their load 17 years ago.  Not that 17 years ago for load?  Jeez, dude.  Oh, fuck.  Remember when that came out?  Come on, man.  Really?  Damn.  In other music news, Scott Weiland countersuing STP, claiming they conspired against him. 
[01:02:30]  With STP.  Oh, nice.  Thank you, E-Rock.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  And Kim Kardashian wants to eat her own placenta to make her look younger.  That's terrific.  Enjoy that.  It's like she's been eating everything else.  She's going to have a gal.  A girl.  I guess that was big news yesterday.  Announcing the sex of the baby was huge news. 
[01:03:00]  Was it?  I guess.  Who cares?  Gives a fuck is right, man.  What happens now?  Bruce Jenner, is it, that's been saying Kanye hasn't been spending enough, any time with  her during the pregnancy?  Kanye is going to blow her off.  And then I'm walking through an airport and all the magazines are saying Kanye's gay.  How can they just write that?  And they're showing pictures of a guy he supposedly hangs out with in Paris or something?  A queeb.  Crazy. 
[01:03:30]  Yeah, there's been rumors about Kanye forever.  But it was on the, where was I flying to?  Oh, for that, uh, my pal's, uh, wakened funeral.  And I'm walking through the airport and all the magazines, there, he's gay.  How can they just write that?  I don't know.  What says, is this Kanye's alleged lover?  But how can they just write he's gay?  But what are the words before it?  Pregnant Kim's worst fear.  Oh, okay.  So it's not saying he's gay.  That's her worst fear.  Yeah, but you see the, see the tiny fond.  So all you see is. 
[01:04:00]  That's how they get away with it.  He's gay.  And that's all I saw because I don't fucking, I don't fucking read these magazines.  That's how they fucking.  That's how they, uh, can do it, right?  Yeah.  Cause all you see from a distance is he's gay.  You could put like before that, you could put, he absolutely is like, right.  It is not gay.  Right.  Right.  Right.  Right.  It doesn't matter.  Right.  Clever.  Yeah.  No, he's going to so blow her off.  Well, it's so obvious.  There is a problem in what they call the black community with, um, you know, dad's just cutting 
[01:04:30]  out like that.  Right.  75%.  75.  It's crazy.  75%.  75.  And then, uh, it brings us to Justin Bieber's hat.  Justin Bieber's hat.  What's going on with this hat?  Oh God.  What was the whole look?  It wasn't just the hat.  Are we just too old?  Yeah, that's stupid.  I, I, I question my, uh, my own age at times.  No, that looks retarded.  You sure?  Yes.  Cause it's easy to say that looks retarded, but is it because, you know? 
[01:05:00]  No.  Pop culture has passed us by.  Why is it way up on the top of his head?  It's, he was at the heat game last night.  It's fully like, like puffed up.  He's trying to look so fucking cool, but it's got his sunglasses on, a lot of gold chains and  a gold watch, black leather t-shirt.  It's actually a baseball jersey.  Is it?  Yeah, black leather baseball jersey.  Is that, uh, and then black leather pants and then.  Earrings.  And then his tattoos on his very, very thin arms. 
[01:05:30]  He might have thinner arms than you, Sam Roberts.  All right.  Very thin.  Very thin arms.  He's, he looks retarded there.  Thank you.  I think.  He just doesn't look like, uh, like, uh, he's trying to present himself.  You know, he looks cool?  No, he doesn't look cool.  Is that how you, they're wearing the hats these days?  Way up high.  Way up high, huh?  Looks like Jiffy Pop popcorn.  It does.  It's, the hat's up too high.  I know the flat brim is, is all in vogue and everything, but it's pretty much just black 
[01:06:00]  guys, white guys doing that.  White guys doing the fucking flat brim hat thing just looks silly.  Looks silly.  It's an identity crisis.  He's just a young guy.  That's all it is.  It's just embarrassing.  Yeah, he, he ought to fucking buck up at this point.  Just fucking stop it.  No one's going to accept you as, as that, because it just comes off too phony and forced.  Just be the team that we are.  Yeah. 
[01:06:30]  Just make your fucking cronuts.  Yeah.  I bet he could get a cronut.  Just make as many cronuts as possible and move on.  You think he'd have to stand in line for a cronut?  Hell no.  The Biebs could just walk right up.  He'd probably have somebody stand in line for him.  He would.  Kim Kardashian?  Probably not.  Probably somebody who's not famous.  AJ Clemente?  Maybe AJ Clemente.  Oh, man.  He would have to wait in line for a cronut?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  What about Amanda Bynes?  Oh, she's crazy. 
[01:07:00]  Does she have to wait in line for a cronut?  Yeah, she would be told she had to wait in line, but then she would flip out or something.  She'd move up quickly, though, because she'd be just blowing guys for their spot.  Does she come off as whore-ish?  I don't know.  She does come off as whore-ish.  She does.  I have no idea.  Yeah.  If I were to guess, though, based on past performance of other whore-ish girls, she fits the bill.  What was that near-miss video?  I haven't heard the audio yet, but someone's got video of a near-miss. 
[01:07:30]  It's in Germany, I guess, and it looks like some type of missile or drone or something.  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  And it just misses a fucking, looks like a passenger plane.  I think it's that one, Sam.  Yeah.  The near-miss between German drone and Afghan passenger jet.  Yeah.  Holy fuck.  It's really close.  Would the drone take the plane out, you think? 
[01:08:00]  It could fuck it up pretty bad.  Right.  Depends on where it would hit it.  How big are these drones?  I want to know what kind of drone this is.  How big is the average drone they're using over there?  For military drones?  Yeah.  They're so different.  They're all kinds of fucking.  This says mishap, hoax, or terrorism.  RPV versus airliner.  Oh, this might be a hoax?  It's probably a hoax.  I don't know.  Let's see.  We'll put it on our Facebook page, Opie and Anthony.  Right, E-Rock? 
[01:08:30]  Yes.  So, whoa.  That does look fucking crazy.  What kind of a drone?  Oh, so.  Oh, okay.  It's video from the drone?  Yeah.  And then you see the passenger plane just flying right by.  What do you think?  Mishap?  Hoax?  I don't know.  It could be.  What do you think that is in the end?  It's so easy to fake shit like that now.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[01:09:00]  Have you seen me flying in my airplane as it almost crashes?  Man, it looks so fucking real.  I mean, come on.  You're right.  Yeah, it looks amazing.  I green screened myself into a fucking cockpit, and then I have my coffee, and I spilled coffee  on and on the controls.  My plane starts to crash.  Yeah.  It's on YouTube, if you want to show Jimmy.  YouTube.  I thought it was a Vine video.  It was, but that Vine video is just a piece of it.  Ah.  I had to do the whole thing.  Oh, really?  Yeah, there it is.  Where's my, um...  There it is. 
[01:09:30]  Jesus.  I'm flying my airplane.  That looks very real.  I don't know why.  What do you do when you leave here?  And then I'm like, hey, how you doing?  I salute.  I have my coffee.  And then, whoops!  Oh, no.  I'm out of my mind.  I was just having fun.  It's fun.  I put things together.  I used to build, like, plastic models.  Now you do it electronically with fun things.  That's funny, man.  It's just, uh...  What's the YouTube channel for the people out there? 
[01:10:00]  And then the, uh, yeah.  Uh, YouTube is, um...  O-P-A-N-T-X-M.  Opant X-M on YouTube.  That's my little channel.  When are you going to get your drone back up in the air?  It's been so fucking windy.  I can't get a calm day to, uh...  The only time it's calm out is when it's raining or nighttime.  What about today?  It might be nice.  Today might be the day.  Okay.  But then, you know, I go outside.  And then I'm like, eh, you know what?  I'm going to go in the pool.  Oh, they fixed the pool? 
[01:10:30]  Uh, still working on it.  Two guys that look like, um...  Definite extras from Deliverance.  Really?  Suspenders.  Big, long beards.  They look like the Duck Dynasty guys.  Uh, they were there yesterday.  And, uh, you know, they're looking around.  They poke around with things.  They put marks on the pool.  And then they try to find leaks.  And they're coming back today.  So they don't know where the leak is still?  They don't know where the leak is still.  Get the fucking peanuts.  It's the packing peanuts. 
[01:11:00]  I am not pouring packing peanuts in my pool.  Why not?  You're at a point.  You got to try it, dude.  I know.  I...  Make a Vine video out of it or something.  I don't know.  They've tried everything.  I, uh...  I had people over Saturday and they come with all kinds of equipment over their shoulders  and everything in my yard Saturday.  I'm like, no.  They go, I'm using this pool.  How many weekends do you get per summer?  They go, I'm not...  I'm not gonna fucking...  18, I think.  It's like nothing.  I go, no.  You...  You gotta come back on the weekdays. 
[01:11:30]  Yeah.  You sent them away?  Yes.  I was like, fucking...  Fuck that.  Were they mad?  Yeah, they were a little miffed.  Of course they were.  Because they were told to come on Saturday.  Yeah.  And I'm like, well, who told you?  Well, this guy told me.  And I guess, you know, Keith's supposed to do the scheduling.  So I blame him.  Yeah.  All right.  But, uh, yeah.  So now they come back today, but I'm not gonna let it interfere with my day.  And you still don't know where the leak is?  Holy fuck.  He's like, we think we've located the leak in the jacuzzi. 
[01:12:00]  It could be in the jacuzzi instead of that.  How would it be in the jacuzzi?  The jacuzzi's higher.  Ah, I don't know.  I don't know.  Oh, my God.  So now I wait and wait, and I try to fucking, you know.  So I have a hose going in it, like I'm fucking in Harlem.  Right.  I have a hose going into my pool.  A little white trashy.  A little white trashy.  And I've worked it out where the hose puts water in just as quickly as the water's leaking out. 
[01:12:30]  Oh, my God, Jimmy.  But don't you get the cold?  That is so bad.  That really is bad.  It's over here.  I was trying not to let it get me, but it did.  Yay.  Yeah.  But doesn't that put really cold water in your pot?  Pool?  Well, let me tell you something.  When you're blasting two heaters.  Okay.  Oh, so you have to turn up the heaters now.  Oh, yeah.  See?  Oh, what a nice.  Oh, Jimmy.  Jesus.  That was from before.  I tried to fucking take the air filter off of my face, and I couldn't. 
[01:13:00]  Right.  Wow.  Thank you.  What did you eat?  What did you eat?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You got to have to.  What did you eat?  I'll tell you what.  I didn't eat a cronut.  I just had a little bit of eggs and.  Yeah.  It smells like rotten eggs.  Oh, God.  Holy fuck.  Some Catherine Zeta-Jones pussy.  Oh, my God.  Is that bad?  It won't go away.  Guys.  It won't diffuse.  Guys.  It rarely makes it over here.  This is a bad one.  Yeah.  This is crazy.  This is a fucking.  I would say this is.  Oh, God.  Lower your shirt for a second. 
[01:13:30]  Yeah.  Lower your shirt.  F5.  Lower your shirt for a second.  Asshole of God.  Lower for a second.  It's still there.  Yeah, I know.  It's still there.  Is it lingering?  It's horrendous.  Oh, good.  Oh.  There might be some more.  Yeah, it's still there, but magical.  It's still lingering.  Linger.  Now this.  Now, all of the fans, of course, loved watching Cliff Lee and Dominic Brown play today.  And how could they not?  Jillian and many other fans wanted to congratulate Cliff Lee for his 16th hundredth strikeout. 
[01:14:00]  A little bit of a tongue twat.  Tongue tie.  A little tongue twat.  A tongue twat.  That's the Gordney McLeaf from Philadelphia's PHL 17.  You think she'll be a guest bartending soon at some shithole down in the...  You know, when you make a mistake on the news.  Well, she didn't say gay fucking shit.  Stupid AJ Khomeini.  They're showing a German drone. 
[01:14:30]  Oh, here we go.  Or in Kabul and was just leaked onto the internet.  I took German in high school.  How come I didn't know they didn't have drones?  Did they have drones?  High school district going to extremes to stop bullying parents in Banana, Wisconsin.  I guess parents will face a fine if your kid bullies.  Oh, really?  But bullying now is...  It's...  There's so many things that are considered bullying now that it's ridiculous.  To me, here's bullying.  Some guy steps up, punches you in the stomach and goes, 
[01:15:00]  You know, bully.  Right.  Telling somebody that you don't like their shirt.  Right.  Is not bullying.  But it's considered bullying.  You sure?  Yes.  It's gotten that bad?  It's gotten so bad that the dumbest things are considered bullying now.  So if they're going to start holding the parents responsible,  they better make a pretty good definition of what bullying is.  Although I do like the shitty parents in a lot of these being held accountable.  Yeah.  Yeah, like all these parents are like,  It's like, you know what? 
[01:15:30]  Now you got to control your shit kid.  What do you think of that?  That fucking thing that fell out of your cunt and balls?  Your problem.  Your cunt and balls.  It is.  Yeah, it kind of is.  Jimmy's not wrong.  I know.  There's a story from my childhood.  We were getting picked up at Fleet's Cove, a local beach.  The gay beach.  I know.  That's...  Really?  I have no idea.  I was goofing on the phone.  You were at the gay beach, but it wasn't gay.  Fleet's Cove and where my mom picks us all up.  And in front of us is this shitty parent. 
[01:16:00]  I don't even want to say their name.  It scares me to even say their name.  Because in the Centerport area, people know this shitty parent.  And I was horrified to watch as they're in front of us.  The mom, the shitty parent stops the car.  So her kid, who's about the same age as me, which I would say about 12 tops, maybe 11 or 12,  stops the car in front of our car so her shitty kid could get out of the car and beat the shit out of another kid.  I forgot all about this until right now. 
[01:16:30]  I was horrified that this could happen.  That a shitty parent would be involved with a shitty kid beating up another kid.  That's bullying.  That is bullying.  And then I would agree where that shitty parent would get fined for something like that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Did your mom ever stop the car so you could go and beat the shit out of somebody?  No.  On the side of the road?  And then the kid is like on the ground crying his ass off.  And then the kid gets back in the car and the shitty parent drives away.  No, I was never the guy that was, you know, beating people up. 
[01:17:00]  No, I wasn't either.  Yeah.  Which I was that guy occasionally.  But that was just amazing to me that there were people like that.  Yeah.  Sometimes the parents are just like, they don't get it.  But bullying, you know, you got to be careful what you deem as bullying.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's like they'll take things like name calling and stuff.  I don't think that's bullying.  No.  You know, it's what kids do.  Right.  You're kind of taking a part away from what kids just do in school. 
[01:17:30]  It's part of that, you know, kind of having to learn to deal in a society.  But they don't, you know, they take all that away now.  No criticisms.  No having to having to work out a problem with somebody else.  Having to emotionally deal with the fact that people called you a name or something.  Like all that is adult training.  And they're taking that out of the fucking mix.  What happens when they finally are let go into this world, into the working world, the real world. 
[01:18:00]  And they don't know how to deal with anything.  Because there are all these rules and regulations in place to try to protect them.  But, you know, it's like keeping a kid in a sterile environment and then letting them out.  And he'll get every disease known to man because his body isn't able to build up immunities.  It's the same thing emotionally.  You got to build up emotional immunities to certain things.  If you shelter a kid too much, he's going to be fucked when you throw him out there.  We're building an extremely boring society. 
[01:18:30]  Boring and vulnerable to everything.  Right.  You bunch of crybabies.  I fucking hate it.  And that's coming from a former crybaby.  Fucking hate it.  He'll piss his eyes himself.  It's getting extremely boring out there.  Yeah.  I don't know.  They really got to define what bullying is.  If some kid is smashing other kids in the face.  Yeah.  Of course.  Get the parents involved.  Of course.  Involved.  If some kid is weeping because he, you know, made fun of his sneakers. 
[01:19:00]  Right.  Ah, I don't think that's bullying.  That Roy Hibbert thing from yesterday drove me nuts all day.  Roy.  That whole no homo being fined $75,000.  Oh, it's insane.  That just drove me nuts.  Yeah.  So, I mean, you're going to interview these athletes and they're going to give you nothing.  They're going to be scared shitless to even fucking speak their minds.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Why bother?  Like we said yesterday, why bother even speaking anymore to the press? 
[01:19:30]  And the press wants you to talk and they get mad when certain personalities won't give  them an interview.  Yeah.  They walk right past them or whatever.  Of course.  But then they just wait and wait for them to slip up so they could hang them out to dry.  And why the fuck would you talk to them?  And why is it not okay to hear public figures say shitty things?  Why isn't that okay?  Again, it all boils down to you're a role model and the children.  Ah, bullshit.  I don't know.  There are so many groups that-  I don't need anyone fucking helping me raise my fucking kid. 
[01:20:00]  Say whatever the fuck you want out there.  I'll fucking explain the shit to my own kid.  Yeah.  Well, that's what they want.  They want someone to do their work for them.  That's ridiculous.  But that story drove me insane.  Yeah.  The guy was having a little fun at his press conference and said, no homo.  No homo.  75,000.  And now he's looked at like he's an asshole.  Yeah.  Now he's got to tweet gay people on Twitter to try to get some cred.  Well, because he's panicking, you know?  So I'm sure the Indiana Pacers, their organization, came down hard on him. 
[01:20:30]  I love when they got to do it.  We don't-  Oh, we-  Oh, neither the organization nor do we take these statements as-  Oh, God.  It's unbelievable.  Yeah.  Wow.  What?  Thanks.  They're just throwing a boat in the water.  Really?  Oh, my God.  Wow.  That's cool as fuck.  What the fuck?  Waiter, where the boat leads, Jimmy?  What are you doing?  They're sliding and they're launching a boat sideways into the water. 
[01:21:00]  Right.  It goes sideways.  It hits and-  Oh, of course.  All right.  We've got to find it on the internet.  And then all this shit comes flying at the camera.  Yeah.  Wow.  Who's that dish?  Who is that?  Who's that dish on Fox and Friends?  Just some guy.  Is that right outside?  Jimmy.  A dish.  Doing a little exercise segment outside because it's a nice day.  Oh, no one made me laugh all weekend because I saw it while I was watching the news programs  on, you know, because I get up early. 
[01:21:30]  The anchors getting involved like you were.  Oh, were they?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Which you pushed forward last week.  Yeah, I love that.  There's some stupid fat fucking kid that's dancing and it's a viral video.  He's in front of, I don't know, some wrestling thing is on TV.  Does anyone know?  And it's all the rage and this kid did it and it's a viral video.  So now all the anchors had to try it.  Oh, why don't we-  I was just thinking of you.  Okay.  And they're all in their fucking news suits looking like idiots. 
[01:22:00]  Let me dance around.  You're doing it right.  You got it?  I don't know what the fucking name of the dance was.  It's some fat little kid that they all think is adorable because he's doing this dance and  it went viral and the TV had wrestling on.  I don't know if there's a connection there or not.  Do you know, Sam?  Are there any-  I think it started with an H, the name of the dance.  Are there any people that look more uncomfortable doing anything than news people?  Are there any more awkward people in this world with the suits and the hair and makeup 
[01:22:30]  when they're trying to do anything else but sit there and read the news?  And they're having lighthearted fun about it.  Yeah, yeah.  Yuck.  Come on.  Join us.  Come on up here.  All right.  How does it go?  And they're looking at the person for guidance.  All right.  So I put my right foot in, my right foot out.  All right.  I do the hokey pokey.  Then what am I turning all about?  What do I do here?  And it just-  And the other thing-  Brewer.  We'll get Brewer in-  Brewer.  In minutes.  And the other thing is when they fucking deal with animals. 
[01:23:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, God.  Because they all-  Johnny Carson fucking pulled that off.  They're all dealing for that Carson moment.  Right.  Of brilliance and-  Where the thing shits on their head or something.  And they just can't figure it out.  Ugh.  Oh, God.  Just can't figure it out.  I was laughing because the news shows, they all had one over the weekend.  You don't know the video of the kid?  He can't be more than like six or seven.  No, I mean, I don't think-  I know-  Fat kid dancing.  It was viral two days ago.  When are you getting a Star Wars kid?  Yeah. 
[01:23:30]  Still pops up after all these years?  Oh, he's pissed.  Star Wars kid?  He's very pissed.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  He was pretty much the first viral star, I think.  He's like, what is he, 53, 54 now?  Yeah, about that.  Oh, boy.  Oh, my God.  Mm-hmm.  No.  Oh.  No.  Kid looks like Chubsy-Ubsy.  Yeah, whatever.  He's got Chubsy-Ubsy disease.  Like, you see his face?  That's like something. 
[01:24:00]  It's like a gene or something.  Isn't it, right?  Look, look at that kid, three down.  That's Chubsy-Ubsy.  You're bullying.  I'm bullying.  Yes.  Oh, Miss Crabtree, I got something heavy on my heart.  You're going to have something heavy on your nose.  No one knows the video I'm talking about.  Mm-hmm.  Whatever.  No, that one doesn't ring a bell.  It was hot a couple days ago. 
[01:24:30]  Yeah.  Nothing.  It does not ring a ding.  This guy's saying, no shout-out from Opie Radio for the tongue twat video.  And what a twat.  Lonnie the Jew.  Go fuck yourself.  What, did he send it and things like?  I guess.  How does he know he didn't get it?  That thing's everywhere.  Yeah.  I've had that happen, too, and it's like, I've already gotten this 50 times.  That's one of those things I didn't even tell the guys to pull.  Travis grabbed it.  What a fucking asshole.  It's not about you, dick. 
[01:25:00]  I give credit all the time when I do get stuff off Twitter.  It's on Deadspin.  I pulled it from Deadspin.  Why would I shout somebody out?  Right.  I didn't tell you to pull that.  Whatever.  Did I tell you to pull that?  No.  There are days I tell you to pull shit.  No, I saw it on Deadspin, and I said, oh, look.  Pull the trigger.  Something we do all the time.  Right.  What a dick.  Unbelievable.  Yeah, this kid.  Thank you, Sam Roberts.  E-Rock gave me a tip.  That looks like him. 
[01:25:30]  Oh, no.  Oh, baby E-Rock.  I didn't know.  What's he doing?  What?  E-Rock sent me the video.  This went viral, and then the news anchors were all trying to dance over the weekend.  Can you start from the beginning?  Sure.  Why is this viral?  It's just some kid dancing around.  Thank you.  Oh!  Oh!  It's nice.  Oh!  All the shorties in the club.  Let me see your chest.  Back it up, drop it down.  Let me see your chest.  Oh, John.  Oh. 
[01:26:00]  How fat he is.  Push it up, push it up.  Turn your phone sideways when you film shit.  Of course.  Of course.  He keeps going out of frame because they have a portrait mode.  Fuck it.  You people are dumb.  He's not cute.  He's fat.  Look at this little fat fuck.  He's spanky.  Why is that viral?  He's not wearing any pants.  That's terrible.  Goddamn good video.  Oh.  Dance. 
[01:26:30]  It's called the wobble, I guess.  Dance.  That's the latest fucking sensation.  Sure.  Not really.  No.  Dance.  Before we go to break, can you play the kid doing Don't Bring Me Down with his dad?  That's another viral video today.  Is that the song?  Yeah.  Two-year-old.  It's our viral video segment.  Yeah, why not?  So we talk about the viral videos of the day.  Why not?  We should get it sponsored.  Ooh.  That went everything we came up with.  Yes.  Where was that?  Was it N.E.W. or K-Rock?  I don't know.  K-Rock.  It was like everything we came up with, they were like, well, they want to sponsor it. 
[01:27:00]  Well, that's why we went off on that goof tangent where we fucking had a theme every  day.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That was based on pissing off the fucking radio station.  Yeah, because they wanted everything sponsored.  Oh, Rock Scream Tuesday and oh.  Oh, that was all, in the end, that was all a goof.  Oh, it was fucking.  We were just being idiots.  Ear cancer.  Just being assholes.  What else did they do?  Far away phone call Thursday and oh.  Yeah, but then we got down a car just having people slam their car doors. 
[01:27:30]  Oh.  Slam your car.  No, no, car door ajar Wednesday or something.  Oh, I hated that.  You had to wake up your fucking spouse.  Yeah, with Tuesdays or whatever it was.  Yeah.  Those were all based on that they wanted everything sponsored.  Yeah, everything was going to get sponsored.  So, like, okay, now watch what we do.  If we did it once, they would be like, well, they want to sponsor it, so can you do it now  every Wednesday at nine o'clock?  Yeah.  No.  No, it was right.  What are you looking for over there? 
[01:28:00]  You got the father, you got the kid, don't bring me down by the Beatles, it's everywhere  today.  Apparently not everywhere.  It's not on the computer right in front of our own Sam Roberts.  Well, where'd you see it?  On MSNBC about a half hour ago.  Half hour ago.  I don't know what website it's on.  I heard yesterday on the after show that Sam Roberts had his first year anniversary,  wedding anniversary.  Congratulations.  Spends it.  Thank you.  Spends it at Caroline's with fucking mankind. 
[01:28:30]  Cactus Jack.  Cactus Jack.  Dude love.  And she had to make believe she enjoyed it, Sam?  She did enjoy it.  But would that be the first place she would have wanted to spend her first year of marriage?  You know how special that first anniversary is?  No.  Holy fuck.  Pretty special.  First place she wanted to spend it was where we had dinner reservations that became brunch  reservations.  Why?  You tried making brunch as important as dinner.  It was a lovely brunch.  Yeah, well, it ain't no dinner.  And you had to do brunch because you had to get to the gig, right? 
[01:29:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  The thing was at 730, so there's not going to be any dinner.  We had dinner at Caroline's.  Margarita pizzas.  Yeah, it was pretty good.  It's on me.  I do like that food down there.  But what happened to the romantic evening?  No, it's all about entertainment.  Oh, boy.  But how did you sell that?  Well, because I said make...  Most guys wouldn't be able to sell that.  He probably said...  We're going to celebrate our first anniversary of marriage at a wrestling party.  Yeah, yeah.  He said, look, you knew what I was when you married me. 
[01:29:30]  You knew what I was when you married me.  And she's like, I guess I did.  Mick wanted me...  I said, Mick asked me to go, and he asked me to do something on the stage with him.  Oh, what do you want you to do?  He just had like a little bit at the end.  What was the bit?  I don't know if...  Because I think he's doing it in his other show.  Oh, okay.  How was it?  It was fine.  I got a good laugh.  He did very well.  Plus, there's a picture of me and Mick Foley on WWE.com.  That's good.  How about your wedding picture?  Is that important to you?  Look.  And I edited... 
[01:30:00]  And Anne hates marriage.  Oh, man.  I just know what the fuck that is.  That first year anniversary?  Dude, it's the first year.  Thank you.  It's your first year you spent in wedded bliss.  A reminder of how awesome that day was.  Yeah.  Yeah?  Oh, yeah, right, right.  Is this about Mick Foley now, this song?  No, it's not about Mick Foley.  I dumped all the video footage into the computer and made a nice wedding video.  Oh.  We watched it for the first time on Saturday night. 
[01:30:30]  It was romantic.  I may not always love you.  This is you talking to Mick Foley now.  No, no.  This was...  I remember at the wedding, this was so sweet, Sam.  Yeah, it was nice.  You see, it was just what a moment.  Yeah, it was great.  But, you know, now Jess, old hat to Mick Foley.  Here's the new song that took the place of that nice song. 
[01:31:00]  Yeah.  Jess, she's a wonderful and supportive woman.  Trade in your wedding band for the hardcore belt.  She doesn't like wrestling, right?  No.  So, her idea of a great first anniversary is not watching Mick Foley.  And you play around on stage somewhere.  But she likes Mick.  And she's very supportive of me and the things I want to do.  Imagine the marriage just once.  Do you know the guy that she wants?  And she could have and could probably get a real man. 
[01:31:30]  And I said, WWE is going to film this thing.  I'd like to be a part of it.  Of course you would.  Because you never know.  She said, I get that.  Things that are on video are very important.  You know.  She's smart.  Like your wedding.  No, she understood that you don't.  And I mean, obviously, somebody at their web department knows who I am.  Because on the website with the picture of me and Mick, it says primetime Sam Roberts on it.  Whoa.  And I never said anything about primetime.  But all that's good as long as it wasn't on the.  Right.  The anniversary. 
[01:32:00]  The anniversary of your wedding.  I don't get married.  I don't book Caroline's.  But these opportunities come up.  And you cannot not take advantage of opportunities.  That.  And Jess knows.  On a scale of one to ten, how bummed was she that she had to do this?  She was.  Off the scale.  You can't give it a ten, though.  Off the scale.  She was not that bummed.  But she was bummed.  She would prefer to go to dinner, sure.  Of course.  But she was not bummed because she understands.  From the beginning, she knew that I do not not take advantage of opportunities.  No, no.  What did you do on Saturday night?  On Saturday night, we went out with her friend who was in town from Brazil. 
[01:32:30]  We had plans in advance from that.  Okay.  And then we came back.  It was like 1130, 12 o'clock at night.  And we watched our wedding video that was done.  So we watched that for the first time together as a couple.  You know.  You know what, though?  Here's the deal.  That's romantic.  It's called sacrifice for the sake of your love.  That's what Jess did.  It was very nice.  No, no.  You were supposed to say, you know how important this is to me?  Mick Foley fucking getting some heat, getting some vid, whatever. 
[01:33:00]  I am more than willing to sacrifice that, to forego that for us.  It shows her that you care.  She, right now, is feeling a little number two-ish.  And I mean that in both ways.  Yes.  You got to, you know.  I don't know there, Sammy.  Look at that.  Yeah.  On the anniversary.  There's Mick Foley holding up.  Who's the big winner of the day?  Oh, I'll tell you who isn't. 
[01:33:30]  That's right.  Jess.  Jess Roberts.  Or Jess.  And I sent Jess a text last night of the screen grab of the picture of me and Mick on WWE.com.  She responded, OMG, that's so great.  She's a very supportive woman and she understands what my aspirations are and how important it is to take advantage of every opportunity.  Jess is a good woman.  She's very supportive and she backs you.  Although you probably didn't read the sarcasm in that.  Oh my God, that's great.  Yeah.  That's great.  Good.  He's playing with his fucking wrestling friends again. 
[01:34:00]  Isn't that fucked?  He went from playing with action figures to playing with the real things.  Now he's got fucking the real guy.  And why is that?  Because they take advantage of every conceivable opportunity.  Well, that's going to get old real fucking quick.  Exactly.  To a wife.  Plus, she knows too.  You guys have pointed out on more than one occasion, I'm not exactly getting younger at this point, okay?  That's for sure.  So if I'm going to go forward in my career, I mean, I can't say no to anything at this point. 
[01:34:30]  That's true.  Jess is now realizing, oh no, I could have married into Flopsville.  Right.  Exactly.  So she's like, you know.  She should be with an investment banker or something.  Yeah.  No, she's not boring like that.  No, just a guy that can actually, you know, support her and will show her that she's the most important thing in his life, not Mr. fucking Mick Foley.  This is what you want to know about me.  I'm a wonderful man.  Oh. 
[01:35:00]  You're neither of those things.  What do you have at brunch?  I have a waffle.  Wonderful man.  Uncomfortable conversation.  A waffle?  Waffle.  And it wasn't uncomfortable at all.  You just had one waffle?  It was like a fancy brunch place.  They just give you a waffle and they put like fruit on it.  So what do you put on your waffle?  It's sugared.  What do you put on your waffle?  Fresh fruit.  Oh.  Fresh fruit.  Blueberries and raspberries and raspberries.  Raspberries?  You don't say it that way.  Raspberries.  Do you really say it that way? 
[01:35:30]  Oh.  And then she had a nice like French omelet and everything.  This was not like a diner brunch, okay?  This was like a $50, $60 brunch.  Oh, well, it better be after blowing off dinner for it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  And it was at the place we were supposed to have dinner.  So it's like we could still do brunch there.  I'm still waiting for that first bump in the road in the fucking Roberts marriage.  This just seems to be wedded bliss for the first year, which is nice.  Unlike, you know, down the hall.  Oh, man.  And Nicole.  That is a marriage debacle. 
[01:36:00]  Oh, yeah.  That is an abomination of marriage over there.  And then the tension in the Nagel household.  You sense it, don't you?  I say it's never.  It's always, again, because it's Iraq, it's always very vague.  Is there tension in the Nagel household, Iraq?  What's going on in the Nagel household?  Oh, everything's fine.  Oh.  All right.  It just always seems to be like nothing bad.  But Iraq will say things like, yeah, I had to be here.  I had to go.  Or, no, the football's on TV and I want to do this. 
[01:36:30]  It's always just this vague tension.  Is there some tension in the Nagel household?  No.  Everything's good.  Yeah.  It's like, ah, I don't know.  But the Roberts household, it's nothing but like bliss and happiness.  Happiness and fun.  We're very supportive of one another and we do fun things with each other.  Can't be supportive of Iraq unless you're a truss.  Oh, wow.  Because he's huge.  Well, I have been gone today, so.  Oh, that's true.  Oh, we had a few jokes yesterday. 
[01:37:00]  Boy, you missed a good one yesterday.  No, I did not.  Right off the beginning.  Oh, you.  Because apparently during both replays, my Twitter kept going off about how awful Sal was.  Sal fucked up right from the beginning.  He made you look like a superstar yesterday.  Yeah.  Good.  Would you have played the Friday intro at the beginning of the show?  Oh, you'd start screaming.  Right?  I did.  That was just dumb.  That was dumb.  It was Sal.  You don't even have to say dumb.  Just go, oh, that's so Sal.  Yeah, that's a very Sal movie.  Totally Sal.  We're babbling, and we got Jim Brewer down the hall, so we should take a break and get 
[01:37:30]  Mr. Brewer in here.  All right, let's do that.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  We'll return after these messages.  The O.P. and Anthony Show continues.  Tear me open, pour me out.  The things inside that scream and shout.  A little Metallica for Jim Brewer. 
[01:38:00]  You know that Lode was released 17 years ago today?  I was listening on the way in before I heard that you had, uh...  Now, you know when you book certain types of humans.  Especially ones you return wallets to that don't appreciate O.P.  Oh, fuck that guy.  Well, maybe you ruined his...  Maybe he just had a conversation about what the devil is, and then you ruined the whole 
[01:38:30]  devil persona.  Yeah.  It could have been so many things going on.  Are you a good Samaritan at times?  Yeah, I try to be.  I felt like I was in a situation where I had to return that guy's wallet, and then he's an  asshole, but then what, obviously...  The last two good Samaritans, one led to a knapsack getting ripped off my back, which  we've discussed many years ago.  A lot of people said, you know, you're lucky you weren't with Lars, you would have thrown  the wallet in the street. 
[01:39:00]  That's what I mean.  It's Lars is there.  That was brought up yesterday.  There's your wallet, huh?  The famous Brewer story.  Fucking wallet, Opie.  The fuck you bringing a fucking wallet back to fucking Harlem?  Jesus Christ, it probably wasn't his wallet.  It was a white dude.  Fuck that white goo.  Why is he in Harlem?  Fucking crack addict.  He's outskirts of Harlem where the hip white people live.  Yeah.  He goes to Columbia as an adult.  He's upper 40s going to Columbia. 
[01:39:30]  I don't know what that's about.  What the fuck is that about?  I don't know.  And then I'm mad because I don't get to thank you.  Ah, see?  All good deeds.  Go on something.  Go on and you went up there like, oh, yeah, I heard you.  I was feeling good about myself.  Well, yeah.  Well, you still should have felt good.  Let him be the...  Right.  He's the asshole.  He's the dick.  Yeah, but now I want the wallet back so I can throw it in a sewer.  Yeah, but see, you're karma.  Although that would have been funny. 
[01:40:00]  Oh, yeah.  Hold on.  You should have...  Excuse me one second.  Right.  I forgot to grab it and just fucking toss it across the street.  There's a time that I would have absolutely not handed him the wallet, walked out of his  building and threw it in the air.  Yeah.  Or threw it in a bush and walked away.  Oh, yeah.  What'd you want really?  If I felt his vibe, the old me would have absolutely done that.  Absolutely.  No problem.  Fucking...  You let him get...  See?  In great.  You let him infiltrate you. 
[01:40:30]  I love it.  In the end, I knew it would be a good radio story, an okay radio story.  It was a good radio story.  Whatever.  He's an in great fucking guy.  Everyone's right.  The guy's a cunt, but you did the right thing.  That's right.  You should have brought it back.  That's right.  You should have brought it back.  Did you know you could just throw it in the mailbox and the post office will deal with it?  I did do that, but that's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.  Who's going to trust that?  A postal worker.  Yeah.  Right.  Who's going to trust that?  Here's my wallet.  Here's my American Express card. 
[01:41:00]  Here's my bank statements.  Yeah.  And my social security.  Can you make sure this gets back to me in the mail?  All my passwords.  Here's my passport number.  Thank you so much, Mr. Mailman.  Oh, fuck.  I'm so glad I live in the U.S.  True.  Where they do these wonderful deeds.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's a fucking underpaid postal employee thinking he's going to...  But he's questioning me.  I'm like, here's your fucking wallet.  I don't need to be questioned. 
[01:41:30]  It's because how...  I know it's because I dress like shit, so he probably assumed the thing.  He probably thought you would maybe look for money.  No, I'm not looking for money.  Yeah, looking for a reward, right?  No.  What did you say to...  Did you say I'm not looking for money?  It's just yours.  I said, I don't need your fucking money.  It got a little heated because I was starting to get pissed.  When he said it, I think it was the third time that he kept saying, well, I just used  his wallet at a supermarket or a store right around the corner.  I'm like, I don't know what to tell you, but I don't need your fucking money.  I found your wallet in a fucking cab. 
[01:42:00]  Here.  He was accusing you of using it.  He was accusing me to be involved in a way that, I don't know, regardless of the scam  or something.  See, now that's when I would have dropped everything.  I'm like, tell you what.  Do me a favor.  Yeah.  Do you have satellite radio?  What?  No?  Okay.  I'm going to get a prescription for you, and I want you to turn on at eight in the morning,  at six in the morning, and you tell me if you think I need your fucking 38 cents and  your fucking wallet. 
[01:42:30]  Thank you.  That's when you start going, I pay more taxes than you make as a salary.  You think I need your stupid wallet?  The wallet's Donald Trump's.  Yes.  Doesn't quite work.  And I was reminded yesterday why I just-  I've got a nanny.  I was reminded why I don't get involved.  When I see some lady fall on the street, I'm not the person running up to make sure  she's okay.  I make believe I didn't-  You're probably the one who pushed her.  I make believe I didn't see it.  I'm going to put your balls on our fucking chin and snap away for Twitter. 
[01:43:00]  Squeeze her ass a little bit, make a Vine video of her legs kicking.  I officially have Vine.  Oh, good.  I got the app and everything on my fucking phone.  Have you made up for your first Vine yet?  I'm a little nervous.  It's got to be a good one out of the box.  Do you want a good one out of the box, or do you want-  I was thinking maybe going with a shitty one.  A lackluster one so that you could improve, exactly.  Now, Roland, that's a good account to look at as to if you really want to aim low.  Yesterday was hilarious.  It was labeled a yellow cab. 
[01:43:30]  Oh, really?  And he just went, six seconds, a yellow cab.  And he goes, wee!  And that's it.  And then a garbage truck.  There's a lot of pressure in them things.  And that, Instagram, I'm finding myself wanting to be artsy.  And at the end of the day, I'm like, does anyone really-  No one cares.  I mean, am I going to be the guy who's huge on Juicy Brewers' Instagram pictures?  With any luck.  Oh, my God.  You don't want to be big internet? 
[01:44:00]  Jim Norton's huge on Vine.  Those are the greatest six seconds I've ever seen, ever.  Is that what we're doing out there?  I mean-  No one becomes huge anymore.  We're all in the fucking creative pool.  It's all deleted.  Every single person is in there now.  And if you do get a little fame, it's short-lived.  It's only for a couple of days tops.  You could be the big guy on Instagram for two days because you came up with something that is unique and it goes viral.  So be it. 
[01:44:30]  I just do it for myself.  I just like snapping some pics.  I know.  You like that stuff.  I do like it.  I tried it for-  I do like it.  I tried it.  I've got six pictures and then I literally stopped a month ago and went, what the fuck am I doing, man?  What are your pictures?  What are your six pictures on Instagram?  I need to know.  Hold on a second.  Because I didn't even know you were on Instagram.  I'm going to follow you.  My daughter made me do this.  Okay.  All right?  Now, I don't even know how to get on here.  So hold on a second.  Hold on.  Jim.  All right.  Okay. 
[01:45:00]  Yeah.  I don't even know what they are.  I don't even know how to get on them.  Are you on Twitter?  Here we go.  Instagram.  I am, but it's not me.  All right.  It's like me and my wife.  All right.  It's a gay picture.  The Brewers.  The Cup.  All right.  Right?  Okay.  All right.  Let's see.  All right.  See, this is when I first started.  I went, okay, the hand guy is going to be huge.  And I started doing my hand guy in different scenarios. 
[01:45:30]  Oh, yeah.  And snapshots, though.  Yeah.  Well, yeah.  It's Instagram.  I know, but maybe you do that on Vine.  All right.  Maybe.  See, then I went, oh, look, here's the hand guy hanging out in Florida.  See, Jim, his wheels are turning.  Yeah.  Fuck yeah.  Chip is going to steal it.  Oh, here's a head and jaws.  Okay.  See, I'm getting eaten by jaws.  Uh-huh.  All right, Jim, you like that one.  That was good.  You know how many followers I got?  Eleven. 
[01:46:00]  Eleven.  So, I mean.  You got celebrity pictures up there.  I got to say, you know, it's huge.  Yeah.  When I go do a show and it's almost sold out and they go, we had no clue about you until  we saw your head in the jaws picture.  And that Instagram account is monstrous.  And I mean monstrous.  You want to get followers today?  Now, that's a fun picture.  I got to say, the one in jaws one is cute.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:46:30]  It's cute.  What's your Instagram so people can follow you?  I don't know.  I don't even know.  My daughter put this together.  It's a Jim Brewer underscore official.  Oh, God.  Who got Jim Brewer?  It's not a great name.  That's not a great Jim Brewer.  I didn't do this.  I didn't do this.  I did not.  Jim Brewer.  I did not do this.  Brewer underscore official to follow him on Instagram.  I did not do this.  So, I don't know what to.  My daughter did this.  She's like, Dad, you got to get on Instagram.  Why?  The kids know how to do this stuff. 
[01:47:00]  Oh, well, yeah.  The kids know how to do this stuff.  The kids.  See?  Yeah.  Now what, Brewer?  There you go.  Oh, look at that.  There you go.  Boom.  See?  Now you popped that out.  Now we're huge.  How old are your kids now?  14, 11.  Oh, my gosh.  Holy shit.  What happened?  What's up with the 14-year-old?  Guys come around?  That dating thing happening?  She wants to.  And you're, like, holding her back, right?  Holding her back.  I'm shutting the door hard.  Oh, man.  But you're in a weird catch-22 because they want to, and it's either sneaky. 
[01:47:30]  It's a cat meowing at the door.  Meow.  Oh, man.  And you either let the cat out and then gets gang-donged or you explain to the cat, listen,  there's foxes.  There's wolves.  There's wolves.  They're going to do this and they're going to do that.  And trust me when I tell you don't go out there and wait a while.  And then, you know, what are you going to do?  Dude, wait.  Wait till your kids get older. 
[01:48:00]  You don't think about it.  And then a friend's, you got to size friends up.  A friend comes in.  I can tell by their eyeliner.  Just by their eyeliner and what they're wearing.  I'm like, your parents are fucked up.  Yeah.  And you've been touched in naughty ways behind a dumpster.  You ain't hanging out with my kid.  You know, it's like slut wear.  You know right away.  Soon as the door opens, you go, nah, man.  I just kid.  Because years ago, that's what you looked for in a girl when you were on the prowl. 
[01:48:30]  Exactly.  Yeah.  Exactly.  So I still.  It's based on experience.  Right.  Right.  Do you have to hang out with shitty fucking people because your kids are friends?  I did that.  I've had just a slight taste so far.  I'm like, oh God, I got to hang out with this person because our kids are.  And you never would have.  No.  No.  It's horrible.  Like, I wouldn't pick you as a friend.  Never.  Oh boy.  Never.  That's the worst.  Never.  Oh, do you like going to the hat? 
[01:49:00]  No, I don't.  Oh my God.  If you have this just horrendous conversation, you would never have.  Dollsville.  But.  It's horrible.  When your kid gets older and your kids are playing with good kids, then you kind of.  You're like, all right.  It gets better.  Because my kids are at that age.  They don't even fucking know what they're.  No.  They don't know what they like.  No.  So it's just a kid to them.  Oh, yay.  Someone that looks like my age I can play with.  Or you'll be friends with people. 
[01:49:30]  Yeah.  And then their kids turn out to be little, you know, little shitheads.  And then you go, all right, I got to cut you off.  Oh, man.  Because you're obviously failing horrendously in that poison.  And that's poisoning my house.  So you're out.  Wow.  You got to think like that.  You're out.  Brewer's a good parent.  The well water is getting poisoned.  Yes.  The well water starts there.  It's poisoning there.  And that's coming into my drainage.  You work it hard.  You're out.  You get frustrated by the parents out there that just fucking don't even, you know, do 
[01:50:00]  the basics with their kids.  Because you're a real parent.  You work hard at it.  Yeah, I have no patience for like just fat, sloth, nowhere dads that are just beaten by  their wives.  Like, just step up.  Be a man, would you?  Like, just be a man.  Oh, my wife is...  What about you?  What about you?  What's it doing?  What's it doing?  What's it doing?  Snap up, fatso. 
[01:50:30]  Don't run and do something.  You would have said faggot there in the past.  Faggot?  You still say faggot, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  They're really trying to take that word away from all of us.  Oh, they're not taking it away from me.  That's, yeah, that's another, like, I'm slowly introduced, like, in the past, I'd talk very  carefully in front of my kids.  Yeah.  Now the cursing's coming out like crazy.  I drop F-bombs to them now.  If I'm really pissed, I'm like, how many times your mother got out of fucking tell you... 
[01:51:00]  Oh, shit.  ...to fucking do as you're told?  Because what...  Dude, you wait.  What you realize is...  Oh, God.  You don't get pissed at...  Here's my future.  You don't get pissed at your wife.  You get pissed at the kids for fucking up for diseasing your wife, because then that  business transition then goes on to you, and the whole business is fucked up, so you  got to go to the kids, like, listen, if she says get out of the fucking pool, it means 
[01:51:30]  get out of the fucking pool.  Oh, man.  Because then you don't listen, then I get it for not backing her up, for telling you  that I'm an asshole, because you're an asshole.  Oh, the politics coming to play.  Oh, the politics coming to play.  Is your wife ever cranky because the kids are doing something they shouldn't be doing?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, sorry, Jimmy.  Of course.  Jim.  Last...  Listen, we all get cranky.  She gets really cranky. 
[01:52:00]  Oh, boy.  However, there's also, there's no, I can hide, I can, in the past, I can smoke or have a  glass of wine.  She does nothing, so there's nothing but pure, I literally got to talk the plane down.  There is no, listen, let's have a glass of wine after, there's none of that.  People can, ah, glass of wine, I feel better.  There's none of that.  It's just going to be, listen, relax.  It takes 45 minutes to talk that train down. 
[01:52:30]  Talk it down.  Last night, I had a couple hours where I was babysitting.  My three-year-old takes a toy and just hits my seven-month-old across the side of the  head.  Yeah.  So then I'm like, I give him a timeout, which I think is ridiculous.  And then I go, and then I go, all right, let's talk about this.  I go, why did you do that?  And he goes, because I'm tired.  Wait a minute.  Because I'm tired.  How can you fucking, how can you even, like, reason with him at that point?  Let me, let me just.  He thinks it's acceptable to do that because he's tired. 
[01:53:00]  Let me tell you why timeouts are stupid.  I know they're stupid, but what are we supposed to do?  What you're, what you're creating is future, uh, um, they're getting used to what jail time  is.  They're, they're going, all right, if I commit this crime, I get timeout for how long?  Right.  All right, so if I smash my brother in the head with a truck, I get to stay in the corner  for 20 minutes and get yelled at?  Dude, that's staying in my head.  Dude, I'm, I'm smashing this kid in the truck. 
[01:53:30]  That's easy time.  Right.  I'm going to smash him in the truck, I'm going to take his pants off, drag him outside, I'm  going to Instagram pictures, I'm going to bully him.  I met him, I met him when I was doing a five minutes, I was doing a five minute bit in  the corner.  I give him.  The first tattoo came when I was six.  Let him know he's boss.  I lower my voice.  I lower my voice and I give him little threats.  I'm like, would you like me to do that to you?  Would you like that?  No.  Oh, that's a good one.  Just, just lower the voice a little bit. 
[01:54:00]  No, daddy.  Not scare the shit out of him, but like, would you want me to do that to you?  Yeah.  But you're going to.  To you?  Yes.  And then you see it in their eyes, like, oh yeah, maybe I don't want that happening to  me.  But then they forget.  You know, we fucked up with the time out.  They're inconsiderate.  We decided you put him in a chair and you face him away from everybody.  So he has to like stare at a wall or something.  But then we realized he was staring at Midtown Manhattan, like this sick fucking view.  I'm like, oh, this is, this is a major punishment.  It's fleet week.  A view I didn't get to see. 
[01:54:30]  He's seeing battleships and fucking cool shit for kids.  A view I didn't get to see until I turned 40.  He's seeing it fucking two years old.  Airplanes and dinosaurs are outside.  Right.  It's fucking just wonderful for a child.  It's like a, just an amazing view.  I'm like, oh yeah, maybe this isn't working.  It's cranes building new buildings.  Right.  It's great.  It's the greatest thing ever.  It's a sick view.  Most stimulating thing ever for a child.  Oh, you wait.  You wait.  You know what you're going to end up doing?  This is, this is my wife and I. 
[01:55:00]  We're good cop, bad cop.  Like, what was it, last night?  It was the last night or the night before.  I'm in the basement and I'm just, all I got is two rooms.  I got a basement.  You still have two rooms?  How's that?  Garage.  Oh, wow.  How does that feel?  I don't even have the toilet anymore.  I lost my rooms a long time ago.  Did you see, did you see?  A long time ago.  Did you see?  How does it feel to have a room?  Do you have a chair that is yours still? 
[01:55:30]  It's not really mine.  It drives him nuts.  This is crazy.  I used to have a room that just was all my accomplishments in radio.  Like, I saw Letterman and all this great shit.  And now it's like fucking.  It doesn't mean nothing.  It's a cartoon mural and a crib and a fucking changing station.  All my stuff is in boxes.  It's 1600s England.  It's over.  The kingdom's been trashed.  There's a new kingdom.  You still have a room.  Yeah.  What was that? 
[01:56:00]  I just saw the movie.  I didn't like the whole movie.  This is 40.  You see, this is 40.  It was way too long.  It needed a really good edit.  But there was one scene in there that literally made me belly laugh.  It was just one scene.  I kept waiting.  The movie's terrible.  But one scene, he's got the iPad and he's sitting down pretending he's shitting.  I do that every single day.  I go in the toilet, pretend I'm shitting. 
[01:56:30]  And I'm in there for 40 minutes checking emails.  Oh, man.  Pants off and everything in case they walk in.  But you can't do that anywhere else.  I do lock the door, but they're on to me.  They know.  We got one bathroom doesn't work.  And then one's a chick's bathroom.  What would happen in 40 minutes?  Hold on.  We have to shit.  We have to shit with the doors open still.  Because at any moment, the kid could fucking kill himself.  Oh, my God.  You know, your old bit.  All right.  We're still in that stage where they just don't understand, you know, that. 
[01:57:00]  And I can relate.  Like, your shit's become twice as long.  I want to know, though.  Because it's the only time you could actually breathe and go.  That's where I make my phone calls.  Right.  But what happens when you're not in the bathroom and you try to take 40 minutes to go on the iPad?  I go in the garage.  But what will happen?  Nothing will happen.  You're just being bothered the whole time.  Really?  You don't have time to yourself.  Yeah.  You don't have time to yourself because it only happens when you're alone. 
[01:57:30]  If I'm there in the room, in the presence of the lioness cubs, nothing.  The minute I disappear, one hunts bad.  It's bad.  What?  Can I?  Can I?  It takes you 20 minutes to ask the question.  Can I have a sleepover next week?  Go ask mom.  She said, ask you. 
[01:58:00]  Well, who's the sleepover?  I don't know.  I'm just asking if I can have one.  Why are you fucking bringing this to the table right now?  I'm in the garage.  Can't you figure this out by yourself?  Oh, my God.  This is a nightmare.  Can we watch a movie?  Why are you asking me?  Why are you asking me these questions?  It's just little stuff like that.  And you have two, Jim, or three? 
[01:58:30]  Three.  Three girls.  Wow.  So now it's good cop, bad cop.  I'm in the basement, and it comes down, and it's 10 at night.  It's 10 at night.  It should be over.  This is done.  Kids are sitting in the world.  Oh, we're done.  She comes down, and the question is, horns are flaring.  You've got to get up there and tell her to motivate herself to do something in life.  She don't do her fucking work. 
[01:59:00]  I told her to have something done by Monday.  Oh, my God.  It's Sunday night.  None of these kids respect me.  Now, I could go up there and punch her in her fucking teeth.  So you need to get up there, because I'm going to fucking punch her in the teeth, and I don't give a shit.  So then I got to keep them two apart.  I said, all right, I'll go up there.  And I start writing down, because I'm also dealing with a female. 
[01:59:30]  Female just goes, and you don't do this, and a thing, and a fucking thing, and you never did.  All right, what do you want exactly?  I want her to do, all right, you want her work done.  Why are you writing it down?  Because I need to know exactly.  You start jobbing this stuff down.  Yeah, my job is just, we need results.  So results is, you need her work done.  Just come upstairs with me.  Would it be bad for you to go upstairs?  Terrible.  Is this a nightmare to you, Andy?  I'm cringing.  Are you losing your mind? 
[02:00:00]  So now, I go upstairs.  Now, I got to play a cop, and a fucking referee, and a guidance counselor.  All in one shot.  Like, I was not ready for this.  I was on the internet.  I'm writing.  I'm going to write.  Jimmy told me to do one-man show.  That's good.  I'm going to start writing my one-man show.  Hmm, where do I start?  Yeah, I'll tell you a story of my life.  Yeah, I'll tell you the book.  Get up there!  Before I kill this human, because she don't do the work that I asked her.  She had a sleepover. 
[02:00:30]  She gets new shoes.  She, we fucking smiled her.  I'm going to punch her teeth.  I'm going to punch her fucking teeth.  Okay.  Now, I go in the bedroom, and now I got to keep her from losing her mind.  And now, I've got this one, who looks at the puppy eyes like, whose team are you on?  Are you on her team?  Or are you on my team?  Are you on my team?  Now, technically, I'm on both teams. 
[02:01:00]  I have to invest in my wife, because at the end of the night, that's the future.  But then there's some times where I'm like, you know, she definitely has a gray area where  she's, mothers fall into that zone where they don't talk to their kids.  It just becomes a, everyone's got the, they just talk at, instead of going, hey, listen,  can you get your work done?  It's like, you better get your work done!  I've asked you 400 times, and who's cleaning them? 
[02:01:30]  Why didn't you clean your turn?  I asked you to, why does anyone?  I'm like, no one's going to fucking listen to you.  That's what mothers turn into.  What the fuck is that?  I'm like, you don't, you gotta get, I said it, I'm going to listen!  Listen, you gotta program them, they gotta program them, it's a computer, it's a computer over  and over.  Yeah.  I like yellow.  I like yellow.  Would it be bad for you if your wife said, look, look, come upstairs at me right now if 
[02:02:00]  you said, hey, I'm fucking writing.  Well, yeah, yes, Jim, no, no, no, I can do that, but now I gotta sacrifice my daughter  from being damaged and potentially jumping out a window.  Right, you had to go up there for damage control.  It's all damage control, because her, she's clearly, it's like, alright, it's like seeing  OB, if we, when we saw him, let's say we were with him when he returned the wallet, and he's  now in the, he's now leaving going, you know what, you know, fuck that guy, I'm gonna fuck 
[02:02:30]  it, and he starts wanting to, and we're like, yeah, listen, listen, walk away, don't worry  about that guy, no, fuck it, and now you see he's potentially emotionally losing his  mind, and if we don't intervene, there's gonna be a problem that could have been prevented  right, that's the situation a father finds himself in, off day, wow, and the reason,  so, and the reason why I returned the wallet yesterday was just to fucking breathe, by the 
[02:03:00]  way, it wasn't about being a good Samaritan, it gave me an excuse to go, oh, I gotta return  this wallet, and then I was up at 112, it was 112th and Broadway-ish, okay, yeah, I walked  40 blocks home, just so I could fucking breathe, and my wife goes, what'd you do, and I go, you  know what, I did nothing, I just walked, and it was the greatest thing ever, walked, I  know, I know, you know what I did yesterday, I had no agenda, I'm like, I'm just walking  home, you know what I did yesterday, I rode a bike, not fag bike riding, I rode my, I didn't 
[02:03:30]  put on the skin tights and the helmet, just kind of on my bike, like a guy, just on the  bike, yeah, I was just doing little circles, and I'm like, this is the greatest thing in  the world, in the world, just breathing, man, yeah, it was really nice, so yeah, it's, it's  definitely, it's good, but it's a challenge, it's a challenge, yeah, constantly trying to 
[02:04:00]  say the other side of parenthood, how do I do love it, but it's, it's a lot of fucking  work, man, learn, my little one, who's eight, learns from the older one, who's 14, now the  14 has a little more muscle, not to talk back, but to just maybe deep sigh, like,  right, right, so now the little one will go, but she doesn't have the rank to do that, so  there's an instant flying off the handle if she does that, there's so many great tears 
[02:04:30]  of emotions, how does a woman who becomes a mother deal with the fact that she is just  turned into what amounts to a monster to these kids, like, it's, it's, it's a creature that's  going around the house, that's to be looked at with fear, and, and, and, and just snaps  at you, anything fun that you want to do, they are there to block it, like, how do you fucking  live, knowing that that's you, how the fuck, by the way, this is the speech Anthony gave 
[02:05:00]  his mother, you lose, you lose all consciousness just to be human and talk, because they do  break you down, they break you down, there's nothing you can, you just gotta, you lose how  to talk after a while, and that's another, you listen to them in the car, and you lose your fucking 
[02:05:30]  mind, that, that just seems to me like, like, do you, do you remember a time where it was  just like, hey, it's, go out and sneak a cigarette, or, like, she's listening to fucking rock music,  or just, just like, where did that person go, where is that person, you, as the husband,  also have to take charge and take them out, yeah, so they're away from that lunacy, oh,  a lot of guys don't, I take my wife out at least once, twice a week, okay, you gotta get 
[02:06:00]  her out of there, who's watching the kids, you gotta, that's, that's a little, almost  like a prison, you gotta take them out of prison, we're gonna go see in the field, we're gonna  go, we're gonna go look at Bert, so you have to keep her as a wife, yes, so somebody you  can live with, yes, or else she's just that screamy person, yeah, I wouldn't want to be  with them all the time, no, no way, she's stuck with him all the time, fuck, his wife 
[02:06:30]  stuck with him all the time, oh yeah, she's with the kids way more than me, I get to leave  every day for five hours, more, you walk an hour to get here, you take, you get something  oh yeah, you gotta meet up with a, I had to talk with, Robbie Kelly had a baby, we really  had to get into it, it's just so hard, we talked for nine hours, you know, it's on the  baby, you know, so, you know, he really needed my, he, you know, he needed my help, no he 
[02:07:00]  didn't, I got, sometimes, you avoided, sometimes I go to Kenny, I go, Kenny, I'm walking home  today, I'm just walking home, so that's another 20 minutes where you can breathe, yes, you  just need to breathe, by the way, Doc Gooden's on MSNBC, he blew us off today, I love going  home, who blew you off today?  Doc Gooden, Doc Gooden, he's right there on MSNBC, he's supposed to be on our show today,  I guess he thinks TV's way more important than this radio show?  More people hear this show than watch MSNBC, and that's not even, like, oh, I don't think 
[02:07:30]  so, no, it's like beyond, yeah.  What is he talking about?  Baseball.  Let's do a book.  Here, I'll wrap it up, I had a no-hitter and I snorted coke, and it was on blow, and it all  went down the shitter, and then it came back for an hour, and I bought crack and I smoked  crack.  Who didn't do coke back then?  And now everything's good.  And now I got a book.  Boom. 
[02:08:00]  Done.  Hi there.  Who's that?  Yeah, that's all you need.  Who's the picture chick?  Photographer.  Oh, your own photographer?  No, we don't have our own photographer.  Satellite photographer.  Yeah.  They only come in here for the important people.  For the business.  Wow.  So you're still on that level.  I should charge them my salary, they just dumped me here.  Oh, shit.  What happened with that?  How did they let you know?  They called you?  Here's what happened.  People are saying you got fired.  I don't believe that.  It's fired.  You got fired?  Yeah.  Jim Boone got fired from SiriusXM?  Yeah, technically, yeah.  I mean, the nice term is let go, but at the end of the day, it's fired. 
[02:08:30]  It's right.  How much time did you have left on your contract or were you done?  They've been renewing me the last three years, but we only do like three, six-month intervals.  Oh, okay.  And then mine was ending the end of March.  Okay.  I was away in March.  Now, usually John, we call him John McDermott.  Okay.  Yeah, yeah.  Comedy, sure.  Right.  You know, he'll sit there and he'll go, hey, you know, your thing is due here. 
[02:09:00]  And I'll go, oh, shoot.  Okay.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  I want to stay.  And then all of a sudden, I didn't hear from him.  Oh, boy.  And I'm like, John.  And my business manager went, hey, you know, you didn't renew the thing yet.  I went, oh.  So I called to renew and I didn't hear nothing.  And then Jeremy called.  Jeremy Coleman.  Yes.  Jeremy Coleman called.  He said, yes, about the renewal. 
[02:09:30]  That's a good Jeremy Coleman.  Well, you know, there's been changes here.  Did you immediately know, by the way, when he was saying that?  Oh, without a doubt.  Okay.  But it threw me.  It was such a curveball.  I mean, there's no warning.  Right.  No, nothing.  It was just no warning whatsoever.  Oh, wow.  It was just weird.  It's like, hey, do you want to interview Billy Crystal?  Sure.  Listen, the renewal.  Oh, yeah.  Didn't you do that?  Right?  Yeah, it was pretty cool. 
[02:10:00]  Yeah.  It was very cool.  And then?  And then, like, two weeks later.  Later.  The renewal.  Well, there's new people here.  And I'm like, I just got to the chase.  Oh, man.  It's like, and the budgets.  Well, I'm not going to insult you with the money.  They want to offer compared to what you've been making.  I'll be like, eh, give me a little insult.  I'd like to hear it.  Did they give you, what percentage of what you were making were they going to offer you?  I'd even want to hear it.  Yeah.  Because then there was a Boneyard thing, too. 
[02:10:30]  They wanted, like, a Boneyard.  It's real money.  I said, what do you want for Boneyard?  I said, we'll give you $100.  Oh, my God.  It's $100.  $100?  I'll just do it for free.  $100 a week, right?  Yeah.  I'll just podcast it.  Right.  What do I want to do that for?  They're starting to sign people where it's costing them money to do their radio shows around here.  Yeah, I'm like, why would I do that?  When you start adding in the commuting costs.  $100.  I know someone else that got that same deal recently.  Wow, that's insulting.  $100 for a show once a week. 
[02:11:00]  Yeah, I'm not doing that.  That's stupid.  That's stupid.  I don't even fucking get paid that for doing a 1992 comic strip set.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Why would I come here to go, ladies and gentlemen, please say, this is Judas Priest.  I'm like, get the fuck out of here.  $100.  I don't know what they're doing.  I'd rather do it for free.  Yes.  Yeah.  I'll do it as a guest spot.  Don't even pay me.  Insult me.  Fuck out of here.  So, anyway.  Then an Oprah comes in and they'll spend thousands and thousands of dollars on her visit. 
[02:11:30]  Listen, at the end of the day, if I had a bet, I'd say satellite radio, which I think you  guys, when I just heard your podcasting, which is really smart.  When I was in Australia and I was hearing bits called, all from here.  Oh, wow.  From our show?  Yes.  And I think it was in Amsterdam and there were bits from here.  That's all internet.  Yeah, definitely.  It's all internet. 
[02:12:00]  It's wherever they get it.  That is the, none, our age is the last generation that listens to broadcast.  It's over.  Yeah.  We're just old farts going, you don't get it.  Now, a couple of years ago with podcasting, we all still were in that boat where it went,  eh, you still, now it has proven it works.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You can make money.  And now, you know, this beast is a, it's over.  It's over.  It's over.  It's supposed to be a good market for comedians in the States. 
[02:12:30]  And this radio show.  Apparently a lot of the radio guys like us in Australia.  Keith Robinson went down there.  They love you.  And he said that they talk about the orange show thing.  Yes.  Yes, they do.  They do.  It makes me want to go there.  Well, hello, Dan and Dan.  I told you that.  When I came back here, I said, you should take a trip down there.  You, you, you might not ever come back.  I'm not even kidding you.  I hear it's great.  It's phenomenal.  It sounds great.  What makes it so cool?  It's just, there's, there's, let's just say you'll, it's very, very Upper West Side-ish. 
[02:13:00]  A lot of blonde-haired people, Jim.  A lot of blue eyes.  A lot of blue eyes down there.  No, listen.  There are a lot of jizz on the Upper West Side, though, sir.  The stuff that, I'll give you an example here.  Yeah.  When I was down there, there was a problem.  Some kids got, got shot. 
[02:13:30]  Oh, boy.  All right.  They, they, they carjacked somebody.  It was like one in the morning.  They were 15 years old, 16 years old.  They ran over, they, they carjacked people, gunpoint, got in the car, drove down a busy  street, ran over three people.  Wow.  And they wouldn't stop the cops.  So the cops shot up the car, killed the two.  So now they're starting a riot.  Uh-oh.  Because they were, they were, um, I think they were Aborigines, two Aborigines descent kids, 
[02:14:00]  right?  So I'm sitting there watching this go down and the head of police and like the, the highest  they're just like, well, I don't know what to tell you if I don't like it.  That's the way it is.  The kids were destructive and we shot them.  Quite frankly, don't look at me for, uh, answers.  Look at their parents.  Why's a 14 year old child out at 1 AM?  That's who you got to look at.  And I'm like, good for him. 
[02:14:30]  Wow.  I'm like, you know what?  You can't say that in the States.  You can't say that in the States.  What?  No.  Oh, fuck.  And everyone's like, why didn't you, why didn't you shoot at the tires?  And the cops and the guy said, he goes, listen, when we draw our guns, we're not shooting to  be nice and we're not shooting to stop you.  We're shooting to kill.  Case closed.  We take the gun out.  We shoot to kill.  And that, I just thought like, you know what?  There's something to say in, in that atmosphere. 
[02:15:00]  We're here.  We'd have riots and debates on CNN and Fox News and this.  Apologies.  Lots of apologizing.  Like, no, two knuckleheads stole a car.  They ran people over.  The cops are chasing them.  You see the lights pull over.  Oh, I love it.  You don't pull over.  Yes.  You're a threat to society.  Yeah.  You're getting shot.  Not my fault.  You were on something.  There's a kid here in New York City. 
[02:15:30]  Yeah.  Pulls a, run away from cops, pulls out a fucking 38, spins around, points it at the cops.  Shoot.  Cops light him up.  Oh, yeah.  And killed him.  Yeah.  There's still demonstrations and religious leaders that are getting behind the  family that's saying they want an investigation.  There are witnesses that said there wasn't a gun.  There was a gun.  It's right there on the street next to his dumb, dead body.  Right.  And it's not 1972 where one of them reached down to his ankle and threw a 38 at the fucking 
[02:16:00]  kid.  Right.  There's too many cameras now for the cops to get away with those shenanigans.  There's too much.  Everyone's got a video camera.  Yeah.  Everyone's got a video camera.  But, but that's the difference because they entertain these fucking parents and religious  leaders and community activists that just the sheer, the only reason that they're saying  anything is because it's a black kid and, and it's usually shot by, uh, even black cops  are considered, you know, fucking white cops. 
[02:16:30]  It's the cops against the black, but if the kid didn't spin around with a gun and pointed  at a cop, why should he get any special treatment because he's black?  Cause if anyone spun around and pointed the gun, they were going to fucking shoot him.  You're done.  But when it's a black kid, they freak the fuck out and there's all kinds of problems.  Unfortunately, what happens is yo-yos take advantage and they, I really think I go in  the deep conspiracy of, Oh, they do that just to keep everyone divided. 
[02:17:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, that is true.  It's just to keep everyone divided because white people sitting down going, look at these  black people.  And then they show the, the black people going, man, the white man's a devil.  Every time they start getting along, they're like, we need a black kid shot and riled it  up, put a fake gun or something.  I mean, it is much easier to, uh, to, to the end of the day, it is easier to have power 
[02:17:30]  over a very divided peoples than it is if they all get together and start thinking as  one, it's a little dangerous.  We should be united, not divided.  Not divided, not divided.  Martin Luther dope.  Wow.  But that, that's why I don't even watch.  I don't watch the news.  It's so, it's, it's like gun laws.  I would, if you, everyone should have a right to have a gun.  I think a gun, that's a gun. 
[02:18:00]  Yeah.  That's a suspect.  Exactly.  That's what I say.  That's a suspect.  Unless you're in the military or you're hunting.  There's no reason for that.  No one could have a machine gun.  You can't have a machine gun.  You really can't.  At the end of the day, this is, the news, they'll say, I, I would sit, some of my friends  are so Fox News oriented.  It drives me, oh, this is how the Nazis did. 
[02:18:30]  I go, what are you talking about?  This is how the Nazis.  I'm like, no.  The last I heard, the Nazis would knock on the door, I'm like, does your name end in  Stein?  They're not looking, like, what are you talking about?  Or, or they'll say, I get so, I, I, I feel bad for people when they go, well, it's the  Constitution.  All right.  Like, are you retarded?  Yep.  Are you, they wore fucking wigs and tights when they wrote up the Constitution. 
[02:19:00]  It took 40 minutes on a guy on a fucking horse to shoot somebody.  There were no cars.  You had to get on a horse.  You had to put fucking gunpowder and stick it in there, chase this fucker, fixing your  wig.  The bouncing of the horse is fucking your wig up.  Then you had to fix your tights and then the gun would go off by accident and it took  another 20 minutes to fucking get this guy to reload.  So that whole not, and, and then there's, and they go, well, what are the, you know, our 
[02:19:30]  government's taken over.  That, that argument makes me absolutely, it is an asshole argument.  It's beyond an asshole argument.  Like, did you watch Boston?  Did you see what happened when the so-called bomber, which is another fucking thing, the  bomber, dude, all right, I'm going to get started here. 
[02:20:00]  For 24 straight, 24 straight hours, they go, I hear me, here comes the SWAT truck and  there's 14 SWAT people.  And they show the same video of the fucking SWAT truck.  And here are the dogs, and then they, and then they would have the helicopters.  And I sat there watching going, oh man, they got those heat seeking helicopters.  It's over.  And then like, okay, we're running over here.  And then they, they're going, I don't know what's going on over there, but they're all 
[02:20:30]  going on over there.  That's how the news guys were.  There's the, there's the helicopter, it's circling up.  It's been 24 hours, he was shot in a juggler.  How do you get shot in a fucking neck?  The dogs can't sniff you out.  Nobody can find, but my kid comes out of the pool with a stubbed toe.  And I can see where this little fucking yo-yo went all the way into the bedroom, not cleaning  off their toe. 
[02:21:00]  Like I can see, you came out of the pool, you fucking stubbed your toe here, you walked  all the way in the new carpet, into your fucking bedroom, and in the bed, I can see your stupid  stubbed toe.  This guy's hitting a juggler.  And the dog, there comes more SWAT teams and more dogs.  And they're, and they're fucking, no one's allowed to have, she like old people coming out  of the house, and they're like, let's go!  My dog has to shoot!  Get down!  Get back in the house!  You're gonna be a suspect! 
[02:21:30]  My dog!  Get down!  Get down!  They got an old lady, and she's down on the floor, and they got the M16s to her face!  Yeah.  And then, okay, and then they show the same video.  Here's them walking around the corner again.  And obviously, the younger guy is following the older brother.  He's obviously the leader.  Let's look at that video one more time for the 1700,000th time. 
[02:22:00]  Here's the older brother, there's the younger brother.  Here's the older brother, here's the younger brother.  This is moments before the bomb.  No one has these fucking guys dropping the bomb, walking the bomb, walking away.  But they got 18 million videos of walking around a corner.  No other fucking video.  Then, they let it all go.  Okay, we're releasing it.  We can't find him.  He's in the boat in the backyard.  Does anyone watch fucking Cops?  Like, he wasn't even, it was straight as, right in the backyard. 
[02:22:30]  Every Cops video is like, ah, he's under the fucking pool.  The pool.  He's under the raft.  He's under a bush.  All right, I'm not going to get into it.  What I'm getting into is the whole, that's very suspect.  When people, when I watched that, that made me again look at yo-yos that are into like,  you can't take my guns away because the government takes over. 
[02:23:00]  So, the government's going to take over and you're going to hold them off?  Did you see what happened in Boston, you fucking retort?  Yeah.  Mr. Educated, watch Fox News 24-7 with your degree.  Oh, you don't know what's going on in this country.  Really?  Okay, your M-16 is going to hold off that fucking army.  Army.  And that was just one town.  And at the end of the day, if you're that packed, it's going to be some kid who's 18 going like this on a computer. 
[02:23:30]  Okay, mission accomplished, sir.  And you're going to be sitting there with your whole arsenal going,  Do you hear, bottle rocket?  What the hell sounds like a bottle?  Making accomplished.  And then the other stupid thing is, what were they, I was just listening to this three days ago at someone's house.  And I just, I'm silent because I just watch these idiots argue with each other. 
[02:24:00]  And they don't even, it's not even common sense.  It's just watching news.  If you watch Fox News, you see NBC, they teach you how to argue each other.  They teach you how to argue each other.  There's no common sense.  Well, let's go to ask me.  On the one hand, you got this opinion.  And on the other hand, you have this opinion.  And in this opinion, you're great.  So you're already going, yeah, I feel it.  Yeah, that's how I feel.  You fucking morons.  That's how I feel.  That's exactly, all right, answer that question, Mrs. Specialist. 
[02:24:30]  And so then, the other one gets me nuts.  Well, China is going to take over.  And this is, what if we're taking over?  If America's taking over, can you imagine, God forbid, we're taking over.  Taken over.  We're invaded.  Oh, wow, okay.  We're invaded.  They got past our amazing, intelligent military that found the fucking Boston bomber 24 hours 
[02:25:00]  by a neighbor.  Wasn't even the military to find him.  The fucking neighbor said, I think there's some blood gushing out the boat.  Or I should say, he wasn't even saying, there's some blood out in the back.  Out in the backyard.  Whatever the fucking Boston people talk.  I think you might want to look into that.  If, if, if.  Some red liquid's coming out of my Boston whaler.  My whaler. 
[02:25:30]  Someone's fucking with my whaler in the yard.  My dog's licking the outside of my whaler.  He's got blood all over it.  I ain't seen no dead rabbits.  And so, if you're sitting there, our intelligence, our amazing military that was all over that,  couldn't stop that, couldn't catch them.  Yeah.  They can't stop whoever's going to infiltrate us.  Then our local police force takes over.  They can't stop them. 
[02:26:00]  Do you think Jed in Tennessee and Bob in Jersey with your, thank God for the gun law.  I got my, Tony on Long Island.  Yeah.  Tony on Long Island.  They're going to stop me.  That's me.  That's me.  That's me.  And Vladimir and whoever, who has just already crushed everyone.  This ain't Red Dawn in the night.  This ain't.  Patrick Swayze ain't going to help you, you retards.  People are retarded when they watch the fucking news. 
[02:26:30]  So, anyway, I don't know how I got into that.  They're, uh.  Bravo.  Very funny, man.  Well, I do have a couple of responses.  Please.  Please.  I do have a couple of responses.  Please.  And, of course, I don't think there's anyone in their right mind that would assume that a  bunch of people with whatever weapons are legally available to the American public these  days can, can fend off the United States military. 
[02:27:00]  Correct.  I never thought that.  I don't think that's actually the point.  Correct.  What I think the point is, is that an armed public cannot be taken over with a swipe of  the pen, uh, in, in more of a figurative term.  But here it is.  You're not looking to defeat the United States Army with your, your guns at home.  Sure.  But.  Yes.  If the United States military and the government leading that military knows it has to fire 
[02:27:30]  upon its people because its people will shoot back at them, it, it, it negates the country.  The country's gone at that point.  So then what is the government actually holding onto at that point?  You know what I mean?  You can't open fire on a huge number of American people because they're shooting back at you.  Now, if the American people have no weapons, it's very easy to just legislate your, your,  uh, um, will upon them and, and, uh, uh, take away people's rights and whatnot. 
[02:28:00]  It's not winning.  The thing is, if you even get into a battle with the American people, you lose, you instantly  lose.  You, you lost the country.  You've lost everything.  The country is supposed to lead.  Supposedly stands for.  Uh-huh.  And, and, and there's no more free United States of America.  I don't know.  And there is one now?  I know.  You can, you can, you can talk about what it is now and everything.  I understand that.  I don't think it's free now either.  Waco?  And I think they can legislate against you. 
[02:28:30]  In small pockets of resistance like Waco and whatnot, you can, yes, you can smooth it over  and say, well, these are individual things on a large scale, on a large scale where, where,  where a tyrannical American government wants to completely take over, uh, in, in some way,  I don't know what it would be, but you cannot make that huge leap to, you know, mission accomplished.  So you can't do that and then, and then have people show up at Disney World the next day 
[02:29:00]  like nothing happened.  You know what I mean?  It, it takes, shut up, Jimmy.  That's a goofy argument.  It is not a goofy argument.  Oh, man.  It's a goofy argument.  It's a goofy argument.  It's a goofy argument.  It is not a goofy argument.  At the end of the day, what are you saying?  I still don't even understand what you're saying.  What I'm saying is an armed population.  Okay.  We all have guns.  Yeah.  This country.  Okay.  Everyone that's armed in this country is.  Yes.  Yes.  Legally.  Okay.  You got arms.  I got arms.  Okay.  I got that.  Now what? 
[02:29:30]  I believe it is a deterrent to the government just invoking its will on the people without.  No, no, no.  Antony, you really think.  Yeah.  Let's say, let's say you've got a tank.  Exactly.  Let's say you've got a.  Armored vehicle personnels or whatever.  Yes.  You have a nuclear warhead in your fucking garage.  Sure.  You really think at the end of the day, someone in Washington's going, listen, it's time for 
[02:30:00]  takeover, but keep away from that Antony from the O&A show because he's got too many weapons.  No, it never goes to the, gets to that point.  So what is it?  I don't understand what you just said.  It's a deterrent.  It's almost a, like someone's got a dog and I don't want to go in that house because they  got a dog.  It's an uneven detente where it's a balance of power based on the fact that if anything  happens, it, it negates what we are right now.  It, it, it eliminates this country of ours. 
[02:30:30]  If, if the United States military starts firing on American people who are firing back  at the military on a level much bigger than Waco, then, but that doesn't have to happen  because you don't understand what I'm saying.  I don't know.  It's a fucking.  It's really pretty far-fetched.  It is not far-fetched.  You're talking about fucking communism.  You're talking about like pure Russian military.  Oh my God.  What?  Hey, look, it's the 4th of July parade. 
[02:31:00]  No, it's not.  Welcome to America.  Help me.  Oh my God.  You're shooting on us.  I thought it was a, I thought it was a float.  What happened to America?  They took our, they took our guns away.  That's what happened.  It's goddamn Nazism all over.  Like you're, you're so far-fetched in what you're saying.  No, it's not far-fetched because.  Yes, it is.  It's crazy.  It's lunacy what you're saying.  I'm not even saying what's lunacy. 
[02:31:30]  It's lunacy.  You're saying more lunacy shit thinking the government is going to have some 18 year old in  a fucking shipping container launching drone attacks on, on cities that people have fucking,  that's lunacy.  That's more action movie shit than me saying that people, the knowledge that the American  people have over 300 million guns in their possession would stop.  You ever see the videos, you ever see the videos of like Iraq war when they're on the  ships?  Yes.  What do you think?  That's a guy packing a fucking missile and that's a guy in a computer going. 
[02:32:00]  Like, I know that.  I think you're missing my point.  I think a lot of people are.  No, I think a lot of people know exactly what I'm talking about.  There is a, there is, it's simple.  There is a deterrent alone in the knowledge that the American people are armed.  Regardless if they're armed with fucking muskets or blow guns or anything else, there's a deterrent  there to know.  But no one cares if you got a gun.  Like, I don't care if you got a gun.  We're talking about crazy semi-automatic, uh, what's the difference between semi-automatic 
[02:32:30]  assault rifles?  Assault rifles.  Shut up with assault rifles.  An assault rifle is a semi-automatic gun like a hunting rifle.  There's nothing different.  Right.  I'm talking like, you can't own one.  You can't own a machine gun in this country.  You shouldn't.  There's no reason to.  But there is already a law.  There's no reason to have.  I know, but again.  Why can't I have, why, why can't I go out right now in New York state and buy a semi-automatic  AR-15, uh, and, and, and take it to the range? 
[02:33:00]  Because if you get fucking wasted or, or you, or someone finds it, it's just, it's a deadly  fucking weapon.  Here's the other one.  Here's the other one.  Well, then you gotta stop cars and we should take cars away.  What a fucking retard argument.  It's all madness, dude.  It's, it's the, it's the thought process that you really think it's going to deter anything 
[02:33:30]  that, that I think starts insulting intelligence.  Well, then I think the bigger insult is the thought process thinking, taking guns away  from, uh, people.  Oh yeah?  Try to buy that.  Try to buy that.  Why would I want to?  Because it's cool.  No, it's not.  Yes, it is.  One of my kids find it and one of the retard kids across the street find it.  What are you, what are you, what are you, what are you leaving it laying around like a rake?  Yeah.  You fucking gotta, you gotta be what's called responsible when you own a gun.  Just like, just like you have to with a car, with a car, you gotta be responsible with a car. 
[02:34:00]  You do.  But people aren't.  That's the problem.  But you have to be with a car.  But you're not.  You're letting people drive.  You're letting irresponsible people get into cars to drive and kill many more people than guns.  Now, you laugh at that.  You laugh at it, but it's the same argument you're making.  Okay.  Oh, they leave their keys around for the 16-year-old to jump in and drive away.  Well, why do you leave your keys in your purse, dummy?  Because no one takes a car and purposely drives into a school and mows them the fuck down. 
[02:34:30]  And you know what?  On a statistical level, it's very rare.  Statistics.  All right.  So when your kid is killed, you let me know how that statistic works.  All right.  How about the fucking...  That's the dumbest thing ever.  How about the six kids in Chicago that were fucking shot over the weekend that no one even gave a shit about?  Because we're that used to it now.  Like, oh, more kids killed.  Oh, is that it?  Is that it?  What are you arguing for?  What are you...  What?  What are you, like, barking for?  What do you want?  You just want machine guns?  I want the ability...  Okay.  ...to live my fucking life the way I want it. 
[02:35:00]  You have it!  No, I don't.  You got 50...  You got a big fucking contract.  I want to buy another one of those.  You got a great...  I want to buy another one of those.  Then move to a country where you can get one.  I guess I can't.  Why not?  Because they figured out, the rest of the world figured out, that when the fucking people...  Oh, my God!  Stop it!  The rest of the world figured out what.  That when you have...  Savages are killing people all over the world with weapons a lot less fucking sophisticated  than that.  And you know what?  The people that kill us here are nice, young, educated people. 
[02:35:30]  They're not savages.  No, they're not.  They're wackos.  They're on drugs.  Most of it is...  Or they had problems.  Or they grew up in a bad home.  They're not savages.  No, most of them are gang savages.  And that's where all the homicides come from.  There's a small portion that are those crazy white kids that shoot up to schools.  And that's what the news picks up on.  But it's not romantic and fun enough when it's just gang bangers shooting grandma for  a piece of crack or shooting at his body from three feet away and hitting three 12-year-olds. 
[02:36:00]  What?  Yeah.  Take it away.  They shouldn't have it.  Fucking take it away.  They shouldn't have it.  Take it away.  They shouldn't have it.  Right.  Yeah.  So what's the problem?  The problem is they legislate...  Like fireworks.  I'm annoyed that I can't light off M-80s anymore.  That bothers me.  But because some retard blew his fucking hand off or let his kid get...  He got wasted and the kid blew it up.  That fucked up 4th of July.  I think we still enjoy 4th of July every year. 
[02:36:30]  Now I got to travel to a fucking river to watch it for 20 hours and then take me nine  hours to get home.  But we still have 4th of July.  It's no fucking difference.  No difference.  Too many retards fucked it up.  The guy across the...  A guy in my general neighborhood.  Yeah.  His kids came walking around the neighborhood with bullets strapped around.  And with one of his guns.  It's like...  He should have been arrested. 
[02:37:00]  Should have been.  But he wasn't.  He should have been fucking arrested.  He should have been.  Which proves to the point we just...  We can't take control of it.  So when we can't take control of it, you're not allowed to play for the choice.  You're fucked.  You think that everyone should be based on the lowest common denominator and what they  can or can't fucking handle?  And that's how we should take it away?  Well, you know what?  I'm talking machine guns.  Maybe sometimes you get up on stage.  Not a gun.  Maybe you'll say shit that offends people or makes people do things or influences people. 
[02:37:30]  So why don't we just take what you say and throw that out the fucking window too, bro?  That's true.  What's it got to do with taking a certain shit somewhere?  That makes no sense.  You're saying that because some people can't handle certain things, that everyone can't  have it.  Murder weapons.  I don't have a murder weapon.  I don't have a weapon I can destroy and kill somebody.  Oh, we could argue that you're fucking influence.  You're very influential.  Your speech is very influential.  Okay.  And look out.  You might influence people to hurt homosexuals or Negroes.  At the end of the day, are you upset just with guns in general or that you can't get 
[02:38:00]  a machine gun?  I like, no, no, I don't need a machine gun.  You want to what?  I like a good semi-automatic.  You know, when you pull the trigger, every one pull, one bullet flies out the other end.  And you use it for target and leisure.  I love going to the range and targeting.  And then I like having other weapons that I use for self-protection.  Yes.  Which is, I kind of like the idea that it puts you on equal footing with some thug that might  want to do you bodily harm. 
[02:38:30]  I'm with you there 100%.  Someone busts in your door.  I'm with you.  I'm sure if someone kicks in your door, the first thing you're going to think is, I wish  I had a gun.  Hey, I'm not going to lie to you.  Someone came over to my house.  He showed me his gun.  He's like, listen, I travel everywhere with a gun.  I need to let you know I have a gun in your house.  Oh, that's nice.  I said, okay, let me see.  He goes, listen, it's in a case, blah, blah, blah.  And he showed it to me.  And I'm not going to lie.  My wife, every night, gives me a fucking false alarm. 
[02:39:00]  Someone's breaking in.  And sometimes I get worried because I know the golf club or the bat just ain't going to  do it.  Yeah.  With a bullet facing my torso.  That's true.  Yeah.  So this one night while they were sleeping over, I swear to God.  Slept like a baby.  No, I got woken up in the middle of the night.  Someone's hustling the front door.  What? 
[02:39:30]  I know I hear someone trying to get in the front door.  This is every other month.  It was the first time in my life I just got up with no fear, walked to the front door and  even asked who it was.  I just opened the front door knowing they may get me, but my kids are safe because right  next to them is some weapons that are going to put major holes in these people or deter  them.  I don't have a problem with that. 
[02:40:00]  It's sort of like playing a game with rules.  We all have rules to this game.  However, as much as steroids, baseball, whatever, obviously whoever's making the rules up aren't  sticking to them.  And it's turning into bad shit here and there, even if this percentage is small, even if it's  blah, blah, blah.  And it's fucking things up for you who should have the right to go. 
[02:40:30]  It certainly is.  I go to a range.  It's like this guy.  He goes to a range.  When I went to the range, this guy had a, he had, it looked like a Smith & Wesson, but  it was, it sounded like a cannon.  And he warned us.  He went, hey, listen.  He was a huge guy who went, hey, listen, I'm shooting off a, I don't even, a salt rife.  He said it's a salt, but it was a pistol.  Wow.  And this thing, literally, it was so loud. 
[02:41:00]  Even with the, with the headphones on, it had a hole.  It was like, pow!  It was probably the .50 caliber, yeah.  Yeah, and it went, pow!  And flames came out the end, pow!  And the, what do you call it, the, the target would just explode.  Like feathers getting, a pigeon getting blown up.  And, and you can see his boner.  And I don't, I would have one too.  Just go, pow, pow!  And my daughter, I have to say, she was shooting and she was a beast.  And she turned to me and she went, I really like that feeling of power. 
[02:41:30]  It's just, uh, fun to shoot.  I get it.  But does the average citizen need that?  I mean, I don't know.  Oh, Jimmy.  I'm just, then, correct.  Jimmy's an asshole.  Right.  So, but who was at the front door?  Who's at the front door?  Who was at the front door?  Her imagination.  I figured as much, but I needed to know.  Her imagination.  Who was at the front door?  You left us with it and I opened the door. 
[02:42:00]  I liked your analogy, though, with the sports and there has to be rules and things like that.  I understand the rule factor.  But here's what happens.  Imagine playing a game where you're adhering to the rules, but there's people on the other team that aren't paying attention to any rules.  And there's, they're not penalizing those people.  Every time someone doesn't pay attention to the rules, they go to the people that are paying attention and give them more rules.  Like a household, if I'm in my house and my kids, I go, listen, no, no Fritos, no snacks after seven o'clock. 
[02:42:30]  Right.  Okay.  Seven o'clock.  Any snacks, you're going to get punished.  You're screwed.  Right.  No, no iPads, no Instagramming, no email, no nothing.  Okay.  Now, when I'm not around, I go upstairs and this little fucker's sneaking.  I said, where'd you get that?  Well, mom said, mom said, hey, did we not agree?  Well, she did do her homework and blah, blah, blah. 
[02:43:00]  And then two weeks later, there's ants infested in her bedroom and in mine.  And the cat has fleas because of the fucking bugs from the Fritos that she ate in a bed.  And I go, this is why I don't want Fritos in here.  And then it happened three times.  And then I go, you know what?  No more fucking Fritos, period.  Because I'm tired of people fucking with the rules.  Everyone's fucked.  So there, it's up to the people.  And I tell the sisters, I go, listen, I don't care which one of you fuckers do it. 
[02:43:30]  One of you fuck up, you're all screwed.  That gives an incentive for the other ones to go, uh, don't bring Fritos up there.  I'm going to tell dad.  That might work.  I'm going to tell dad.  In the brewer dictatorship that you live in.  Yes.  Well, Fritos.  Someone's eating the Fritos in bed.  And no one's.  But I have a right to bear Fritos. 
[02:44:00]  Yes, you do.  You cannot take that away from me.  Yes, you do.  And no one's going to come in and take them at the end.  If you got the Fritos in your house, they're in your house.  Tough shit.  They're in there already.  From here on now, it literally should be like, sit down.  What's your name?  Where are you from?  First of all, the way you look, you got to go home.  It's already out.  You're already out.  You're already out.  Do you know what I have to go?  You know what people have to go through to get a gun, especially in a place like New York.  It is nearly impossible to get a pistol, the ability to own a pistol in New York City. 
[02:44:30]  New York State, it's tough enough.  Rifles, shotguns in New York City, almost impossible.  You could do it in New York State.  But now they're legislating things like, all right, I have a pistol.  It holds nine rounds in the magazine.  Yeah.  Now there's a law that was just passed that said I can only put seven bullets in whatever magazine I have.  So if I have a 10-round magazine, I'm only allowed to put seven bullets in it.  Now, what will this do for crime at all? 
[02:45:00]  Because now what they're doing is, if you're caught that you don't even know the law, you pop nine in because it fills the mag up and you put it in and you're caught, you now are a criminal.  You've taken a guy that has legally paid attention to the laws.  He's kept his old nose clean.  He's gone through the hoops to get the gun.  And now, through this illusion that you're, there's Cuomo signing the big anti-gun violence bill. 
[02:45:30]  Sure.  And making this guy now go to jail or pay a fine or not be able to have a gun because he's violated a gun law where he's put two more bullets than we're supposed to be.  Do you think a guy that's going to commit a gun crime is going, well, at least I only put seven rounds in there.  I didn't fill the gun up.  I'm pointing it at someone and stealing his money or I'm shooting somebody.  So these laws that they put in place under this phony guise of public safety and anti-violence, and they always give it a good name, they are doing nothing to make people safe. 
[02:46:00]  What they are doing is taking people that have been adhering to the law and being good and safe and fucking them up.  I don't get that part of the whole thing.  It's politics.  Well, yeah.  It's just politics.  It's the politics of contraband itself.  The smuggler's blues.  I know.  And I really contemplated on getting a gun, especially after Hurricane Sandy because we had no electric. 
[02:46:30]  And that's the first time.  Man, you shoot the fucking lipo guys.  I know.  That's the first time where I realized how vulnerable everyone is.  Everyone's vulnerable.  Our neighborhood was fine, but it only took three to five more weeks before our neighborhood would be like, hey, you got any food in there?  It was getting crazy at the gas station.  Not only was three to five weeks, by the way.  You look at each other.  You do that mouth.  We're like, we're all here.  It's gas. 
[02:47:00]  And then by the next day and the day after that, you start to look like, yes, I don't think he was here online.  And you all get that Twilight Zone mob mentality?  There he is.  He's the one that started it.  He'd chase it down with pipes.  Two weeks tops.  Yes.  It would take two weeks.  Yeah, yeah.  Imagine if everybody had guns.  That's how fast things would get bad.  Right.  A couple people get popped here and now.  Let me tell you one thing.  I never worried about me getting gasoline.  That's for sure.  I'm putting it in the container. 
[02:47:30]  Back up.  Back up.  There's seven bullets in here.  I'm adhering to the rules.  I'm adhering to all the laws of the land.  How many bullets do you need, right?  But I'll take seven to get it.  I do say.  I was going to get.  I was thinking about getting a gun.  My wife was upset with me.  I went.  In Jersey, you got to go to the police station.  I don't know where it is.  Oh, it's crazy.  Police station, all that jazz.  And then I really, I know for myself, I'm not sure. 
[02:48:00]  Not that I would, not that I would use it, but I would flash it a lot.  Oh, shit.  A little brandishing.  I would be a flash.  That's illegal.  Me and Jimmy say that.  I'd be a flash.  Yeah, that's very illegal.  We're not responsible enough to have guns.  And that's what my, my friend is very responsible.  He's like, listen, you know, the rule is you never take a gun out unless you're using it.  Case closed.  He goes, the minute you take it out, you're, you're, you're screwed. 
[02:48:30]  You're opening yourself up to a lot of shit right there.  You better make sure that other person is popped, shot, done, no questions asked.  And I was like, yeah, I don't, I don't know if I'm capable of doing that.  I really don't.  If you just, if I don't know, I, I don't know.  But I know.  It's a great responsibility.  My point is like, I know, I don't have that responsibility yet.  I know if you come in my house by, he told me an instance where, I said, did you ever 
[02:49:00]  take it out?  And he said it one night, scared the living, the life out of me.  It was about three in the morning, someone's banging my front door trying to get in.  He goes, I took out, he has like a, I don't know, nine millimeter or whatever.  He takes out his gun.  He aims it at the door and announces, I have a gun.  It is loaded.  I will be shooting you. 
[02:49:30]  Please.  I'm calling the police.  So do we, motherfucker.  Oh shit, we.  Right.  He said, they then opened up the screen door and started banging the door as in trying to  get it shouldering their way in.  Come on.  He said again, I'm going to shoot.  The minute that door is open, I'm open.  He's got a little house.  It's not like a, it's a little place in Florida.  It's not like he's in a mansion and there's money to be taken here and then they went to 
[02:50:00]  the window where they started opening the window and then he heard giggling and he realized  it was his wife's, oh boy, wasted friend trying to be funny.  Oh, cute.  And he's like, I literally almost killed this jackass.  Did he yell at her or him?  I, I, I, you've got to assume.  I, I assume that. 
[02:50:30]  Why did I ask that question?  You have a great story and I throw a literal question.  So what was the temperature?  I would have stuck the gun up right down their esophagus.  Yeah.  And, and pulled the, not pulled the trigger, but I would, yeah.  Yeah.  For an hour straight, I would have stuck a liking, Karen, Karen, I'm sorry.  It would have been that scene.  Gun blowing in your face.  I just, obviously you've got to be pretty sure about what you're doing. 
[02:51:00]  I don't think I would have even let him get that far.  I would have started.  Oh my God.  It's a, no, never through the door.  Right through the door.  Oh, never through the door.  That's a movie thing.  I have three kids.  You're done.  You have five seconds, whether you're intoxicated or not.  We've got to piss.  Oh, okay.  I've got to piss too.  Yeah, all right.  Jimmy had to leave.  Yeah, I'll piss too.  Okay.  Yeah, Jimmy just left.  Wrong.  Hey, Brewer, what are you promoting, by the way?  What do you got here?  Let me see.  June, Friday night, Epix, new special.  Same thing where Jimmy is.  Jimmy's on Epix. 
[02:51:30]  Yeah, yeah.  That was great.  So what?  A bunch of us are on Epix.  Nice.  I think I kick it off June 7th.  Nice.  I think it's me, Norton, and a bunch of other comics all with new one-hour specials.  That's exciting.  And then what do you got?  Colonial Theater, Pittsfield, Massachusetts.  Oh, yeah.  That's all this week.  There's Pittsfield.  There's Connecticut.  That's June 6th.  Richfield, Connecticut, June 7th.  Bay Street Theater, Sag Harbor.  Yeah.  Almost got a summer house in Sag Harbor.  Did you?  Almost.  They wanted way too much money, but who gives a fuck?  Why may I even say?  June 10th, Bay Street Theater, Sag Harbor. 
[02:52:00]  Nice.  And then Governors, June 13th to the 16th.  Yeah, Thursday, Friday, Saturday.  Thank you.  Jimbrewer.com for your dates.  Yeah, Facebook, all that jazz.  All right.  The Opie and Anthony Show continues in moments.  And now these messages.  Sirius XM.  And now, The Opie and Anthony Show.  E-Rock decided it's Metallica, Metallica Day. 
[02:52:30]  Right, E-Rock?  See, there we are.  Yeah, for Lode.  Yeah, Lode was released 17 years ago to Brewer and Studio.  Turkey.  They're protesting in Turkey.  Oh, boy.  And they're not fucking around with the protesters down.  They're annoyed at the Greeks.  Down there in Turkey.  They're annoyed at the fucking Greeks.  And then this motherfucker, he wants to think who he is.  You see the video of the guy with the fucking fire hose that went viral? 
[02:53:00]  Oh, that was great.  Whoa, whoa.  Yeah.  Where was it?  Turkey?  The guy was basically telling the cops, I guess, you know, all right, fucking hit me  with your hose.  He was mouthing off.  Really?  Oh, they did.  Okay.  All right, if you want it.  Did they ever.  Wow, that hose can fucking push a human being.  What are you popped up about?  Turkey?  I think they want to make a mall or something.  I don't even know what the whole turkey situation is about.  I think the government decided they want to make a mall and it was like, I don't know,  it was like a fucking park or something. 
[02:53:30]  Yeah, I believe that's what that's about.  What would you protest about?  Oops.  Huh?  What would you protest?  Like, Americans don't protest about anything.  We protest about nothing.  What would we protest about?  Occupy Wall Street, man.  No, like, even that, like, what would we, what would make us violent?  Like, white people.  White people.  Nothing.  Nothing.  We are the worst.  As Americans, nothing.  What?  If they fucked with religion.  What do you mean?  If they made some, some sort of a religious activity illegal or wherever there's going 
[02:54:00]  to be a large gathering of people.  Something like that might cause a violent protest.  Violent, though?  Yeah.  I don't know.  People get crazy over religion, man.  Oh, they get crazy.  We've never seen any of that.  As a populist, though?  Yeah, Catholicism.  Like, let's just say they were limiting the amount of times you could go to church where  they were, eh, where they weren't allowing churches, whatever they were doing, that would 
[02:54:30]  cause, I think, a lot of people to show up.  To get a situation like Turkey?  Oh, I didn't know you were talking about Turkey.  I just came in.  I'm just, I'm curious, like, when's the last time we, was it Woodstock?  Like, when's the last time, even that was more peaceful.  Was it not the Vietnam War?  Yeah, the Vietnam War was pretty.  What was the last time where we got together and we're like, okay, we're going to start  breaking stuff.  Yeah, in the Iraq War, Afghanistan.  I mean, not breaking anything, but they were protesting Iraq and Afghanistan.  Was it big?  Oh, yeah. 
[02:55:00]  I can't think of something that we'd get behind like that.  Not as Vietnam-ish, but.  Huh.  I mean, even taxes are completely out of control and we don't even fucking.  We don't do nothing.  We don't do shit.  We don't do shit.  Well, the Tea Party tried, as much as people don't like the Tea Party for certain things,  they really were just protesting taxes.  Yeah, that was the big thing.  And the media mocked them.  Like, maybe they are all conservatives, but they really were just protesting taxes.  And the fucking media went after them terribly, whereas Code Pink, who, again, they serve  a purpose too, would never be mocked because the press kind of likes them.  It's really odd how they were just treated like dickheads. 
[02:55:30]  Yeah.  When they really were just fighting, giving up more of their money.  It's like, hey, dummies, none of us want to pay more taxes.  So that was the last of the Tea Party.  Kenny sent me a great video.  What was that?  Was that the, uh.  Some guy getting chased by the cops and then he gets out and starts shooting and the cops  shoot at him.  Boy, one to the fucking center of your head puts you out of commission immediately.  This guy dies so fast.  Right.  It's like, look at him.  Look at this guy.  He's like, pop, pop, pop, pop. 
[02:56:00]  And then he's just right on the fucking head.  He's gone in a second.  That really does stop you.  Pop, boom.  It's on LiveLeak?  Oh, is that it?  Go to the end.  Go to the very end because he just gives him some shit here and he takes off.  Where did this happen?  Go all the way to the fucking, like, where there's only, keep going.  Keep going.  Right there.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  That's it.  That was it.  Pop, boom.  Like, what was he, what was he thinking?  Your life is over that.  But I'm sure the cop's in trouble or did he do something wrong? 
[02:56:30]  Because he's supposed to just take the bullets?  Uh, yeah.  Man.  Wow.  He, uh, wow, that was right.  That's the compliment.  Okay.  Where did this happen?  Uh, where is that?  Uh, Salah.  What is it?  It looks like another.  What?  That's Ohio?  Yeah, Toledo.  Yeah, Toledo.  Toledo.  Holy Toledo.  Yeah.  You know what?  Uh, that guy, first of all, I think he fired off more than seven rounds.  He's very illegal.  He got a lot of shots out.  Hey.  Uh, you know what?  Here he comes.  He fucking. 
[02:57:00]  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.  Go to sleep.  Boom.  Gone.  Fucking gone.  God, I wish I could sleep that well.  It hit him right in the center of the forehead.  Dude, how fucking wonderful.  Oh, man.  That's how kids sleep.  I know.  Jimmy knows.  They'll go full speed and within a half a second they're out cold.  I was holding Bob Kelly's baby.  And, uh, it's so fucking cute.  I'm going to call this cock.  How old is he?  Like a day?  Like, is it just this week he had the video?  Yeah, yeah.  I held him yesterday.  And, uh.  The little baby Max.  I'm watching him sleep. 
[02:57:30]  Because, like, Bobby hands it.  I sat down.  I'm so paranoid about babies.  I sat down.  I kind of made sure I had the head cradled and shit.  But I'm like, the kid, nothing.  He just, he's all bundled up and sleeping.  Yeah.  I'm like, how fucking adorable is this thing?  Great.  I wanted to kiss it, but I'm like, I don't want to give germs.  He has no worries.  He has no worries yet.  None.  He's nothing.  Bob literally, I thought it was, you know, because Bob's such an ass, but I thought  it was funny.  He had, I was watching him.  He was showing me a picture.  He has 600 photos already.  Oh, my gosh.  Holy shit.  But when you have your first baby, it's almost impossible, just time-wise.  I know, but you just got to keep. 
[02:58:00]  I probably would have done that.  Yeah.  If I was capable of doing it.  I'm so, I think the baby's so cute.  I don't have any kids, but I'll show pictures of me with other people's kids.  Yay.  But here's a picture of me with other people's kids.  Brewer, how many pictures do you have of your third kid?  Brewer's just looking around kind of smiling like, yeah.  Listen, he doesn't know who's listening right now.  I could see when all my videos ended.  Yeah?  I had so much, I'm going to say, gosh, thousands of hours of video all the way up until like 
[02:58:30]  seven years ago, and I was like, all right, I'm done.  What am I doing?  Did you ever watch all those videos?  Yeah, I watch them all the time.  Oh, you have?  Okay.  Yeah, I watch them all the time.  Yeah.  Yeah, there's a drop off.  VHS?  I should have more and more kids.  Was it the old VHS on the shoulder?  I used to have that.  I got stolen.  I did, too.  Oh, did it?  Yeah.  My wedding day.  And who do you think stole that?  I know exactly who stole it. 
[02:59:00]  Matter of fact, I can make it a fact, Your Honor.  When they opened up the trunk of my car, the only thing left was tennis rackets.  Now, you and I both know who doesn't play tennis, unless they're twins or whatever they  are.  When people first got the camcorders and stuff, there's the giant VHS, and they would take  them on vacation. 
[02:59:30]  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I had it.  You're trying to fucking walk around.  You're sporting this heavy fucking shit.  Yeah.  Oh, VHS.  Fucking hatches opening up and shit.  Now you got to carry the tapes around with you.  That's right.  A little box of tapes.  And then it was all blurry and gooey looking.  Oh, terrible.  I loved it.  That ended in...  Just the tracking.  9192.  That's right.  About that, yeah.  I really...  It really...  I really did...  It got stolen out of my... 
[03:00:00]  It ended in 9192?  Somewhere around there.  Those...  They were done with those cameras.  And then they started going into the smaller digital tapes.  Yeah, yeah.  I know that for a fact because I had that camera, Ant, and then we were getting...  My car got stolen the night of our wedding.  What?  Yes.  I never told you guys this.  No, I don't think we've ever heard this one.  Let me tell you.  I swear to God.  Wow.  My kids' lives.  One last...  Yahoo.  We go out. 
[03:00:30]  We have some drinks.  I get banged up.  My best friend drives me back to the hotel.  All my stuff is in the car.  The tuxedos.  Oh, fuck.  And all the honeymoon stuff.  I had that camera.  Oh, man.  I had tennis rackets.  I had...  I don't know.  But, you know, we're packed to go on vacation, which we have no money, so we go nowhere.  Um, and the next morning, we woke up, and I'm like, the day of the wedding, like, where  is...  Didn't we park right here?  Oh, shit. 
[03:01:00]  And I really thought it rolled away.  Oh, maybe...  Because anything, but it's stolen, right?  Yeah.  Anything, but it's stolen.  I didn't get that it was...  There's no way it could have gotten stolen.  Yeah, yeah.  I walked around the whole...  Oh, fuck.  ...the whole hotel, and then I went to the front desk, and I went, I think my car got  stolen.  And the guy went, you too?  Oh, no.  He goes, that's the sixth one.  He goes, they've been coming here every weekend, and, uh...  How about you fucking...  How about you warn us?  Right.  Maybe a warning.  Maybe you would take your shit out of the car. 
[03:01:30]  We borrowed my mother-in-law...  Thank God.  My best man and best friend, all he took out was the tuxedos, because I said, just leave  everything in there.  He's like, no, no, no.  God forbid.  Take everything out of the car.  I went, no, come on, stupid, okay, and he's married tomorrow, and he took the tuxedos  out.  Thank God.  But when they found the car, it was in Newark.  Where was it stolen from? 
[03:02:00]  It was Union.  Okay.  Union, New Jersey, in a Holiday Inn parking lot off, like, Route 22 or whatever.  They stole the car.  The night of my wedding, they tried to take...  They tried to steal my best man's car, but we were all by the window, saw them, start  running down, and the alarm went off.  Yeah.  Union, New Jersey, Holiday Inn.  And so, they get the car.  There's White Castle boxes, the clubs they went to, and they took everything out of the  car, except for the tickets.  That's right. 
[03:02:30]  What the fuck are these things, motherfucker?  I don't know what the fuck this shit is.  They probably thought they were broken spoons.  These ladles are no good.  They got holes in the motherfucker.  Yeah.  Holy shit.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, I remember those cameras.  Damn.  That sucks.  Yeah, whatever.  You guys still went on your honeymoon, right?  Yeah.  It was pathetic, too.  Where'd you go?  Try to guess.  Now, first of all... 
[03:03:00]  Jersey Shore.  Now, we had $200 when we got married.  Ooh.  Wow.  You had $200.  Yes.  And so, on a friend's credit card, I booked a place.  And it's so pathetic and so funny.  Oh, no.  You didn't go to the Catskills, did you?  No.  Very long.  No, we didn't even go to a sexy place.  Oh, okay.  We went to the Rocking Horse Dude Ranch in Poughkeepsie, New York.  I went there when I was in fifth grade.  Oh, there you go.  On a fifth grade trip.  Why would you go there? 
[03:03:30]  I know you had no money, but okay.  She liked horses.  And I went, oh, dude, Ranch.  Oh, no.  Not knowing.  We were only two retards there.  I got on a honeymoon.  Everyone there had like four kids, five kids.  Oh, no.  It's a total family resort.  And I just started thinking about this, too, where we were in a cabin.  There's only one section with cabs.  Do you either stay in the hotel part or the cabin. 
[03:04:00]  We were in the cabin.  And I think I scored a duper.  And one of my friends gave me a duper.  And we went in the cabin at duper.  And all these kids are playing outside.  Now that I think about it, we thought we were so private in there.  We must have stunk the whole place up.  And people are like, oh, my God.  They're smoking marijuana.  Smoking marijuana.  They're smoking marijuana.  Children.  Fuck.  Yeah.  And then we snuck into the stables and just thought, you know.  So, yeah.  That was our honeymoon.  Wow.  The Poughkeepsie Rocking Horse Dude Ranch. 
[03:04:30]  Oh, wow.  It costs $800-something for the weekend.  Damn.  Yeah.  Back in?  Back in 93.  20 years this year.  You've been married 20 years.  Yeah.  Holy shit.  Stick that in your hiney.  Holy fuck.  20 years.  That's right.  20 years.  Think you're right in there.  Fuck, dude.  Rocking Horse Dude Ranch where kids stay free.  All right.  There you go.  There you go.  What are some of the activities, Sam? 
[03:05:00]  Chessing.  Oh, man.  Let's look at the activities.  What are the activities?  Horseback riding.  Nice.  Outdoor water sports.  Nice.  Outdoor activities.  Let's see what those are.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  Softball field.  There was a softball game.  We got trashed and I played softball.  And all these people playing with kids.  And I'm playing for a million dollars.  I want to sharpen one up.  I was so annoyed.  People were playing with their kids.  It was so angry. 
[03:05:30]  You, like, fucking just jumped on some team?  Yeah, they divided.  You showed up for the game and they divide you up.  But I played to win.  Yeah, you're serious.  It was really aggravating.  Like, oh, he's safe.  Fucking blocking the plate.  Some little kid's running.  You go, bam!  Fucking smash that kid down hard.  Fat 12-year-old punk.  Like, sliding with his spikes up.  Yeah, stupid dumb running mistake, retard.  Right.  I let him know in front of his family how dumb that was. 
[03:06:00]  I can't believe you went here for your fucking up.  Yeah, of course you can believe it.  How long were you there?  We've heard the stories over the years.  What?  How long were you there?  Three nights?  Wow.  That's all I could afford at the time.  Did you play on the Fort Tiny playground?  We did.  We hung out there.  We were all lit up.  Stoned would be, like, that makes it a little better because you're just like, dude, look,  we're in a playground.  I can't believe we were, it was nothing more embarrassing than us sitting down at the table. 
[03:06:30]  You don't get your own table.  You got to sit down with, like, eight to ten other families.  Yeah, yeah.  And they're like, so, who are you here with?  Like, we're here on a honeymoon.  And it would be complete silence.  You know what?  What made you come here?  I don't know.  She liked horses.  Look at the pictures.  I got a dangling cross-earing.  Right.  Show.  Show.  Jesus.  Did he do the hula band concert?  Oh, my God.  That looks awful.  Scavenger hunting. 
[03:07:00]  Scavenger hunting.  Is that a show?  We got to lift it up on our honeymoon.  Are we in a little shows?  A tug-of-war?  A tug-of-war.  You know I won that one.  With the pants.  No, it's not with the pants.  Jesus.  Oh, there's game show activities.  I guess this is a game show activity.  One of them, who wants to be a buccaneer?  Ooh.  And I remember there was a magician playing there that night.  Oh, God.  We watched a magician?  This sounds like the worst fucking place.  What a lousy honeymoon.  Wow. 
[03:07:30]  It's lousy, Jim.  But you know what?  20 years later, and they're still together.  They're probably people that spent fucking all kinds of money, went to Hawaii, and all  this shit, that are gone, long divorced.  Done.  You're still, you know, the important thing there.  Warrior.  You're still together.  Thank you, Anthony.  You kept it real.  Yeah.  Take your guns.  You're allowed to have them.  Thank you, Jim.  How about some of the entertainment?  At least it wasn't a bed and breakfast.  I don't want a bed and breakfast.  I love your bed and breakfast stories.  I don't like a bed and breakfast.  What was it in Denver?  Yeah, close. 
[03:08:00]  It was either Montana or Colorado.  The pseudo-gay guy?  Yes.  The massage.  What's his name?  It was Doug Henning.  Doug Henning.  It was a Doug Henning-looking guy.  And he said he was the drummer for Journey.  Wow, really?  That's what he said.  He goes, well, I played drums for Journey.  And I was giving you a massage at a bed and breakfast?  A naked one.  It was horrifying.  Remember this story?  Yes.  He was naked?  Bizarre.  I had, I never had a massage before, so he really was pushing the massage. 
[03:08:30]  And so.  At a bed and breakfast.  Dude, not only that, it was, it started off in a hot tub, and I just remember my, him  and his wife were supposed to meet us in the hot tub.  And just, he came out.  Oh, that's serious.  Doug Henning came out.  Doug Henning gets in with my wife and I, and I saw her look, she gave me that look like,  what's going on?  And she went, I'm very uncomfortable with you rubbing my leg.  Jim likes his legs rubbed.  I went, oh, you know what he's talking about? 
[03:09:00]  So he started massaging.  The guy was rubbing her legs?  Yeah, and then he started massaging my legs in the hot tub.  What the fuck?  He didn't take that as a hint to get the fuck out?  No, dude.  That's how stupid I am.  I can easily be raped one day.  I can, I know I can.  I almost was.  Without even knowing it's happening.  Just because you don't want to make a scene.  Yes.  Just because I don't want to.  That's so stupid.  So you're allowing Doug Henning to rub your leg out.  So Doug Henning brings me up to his bedroom.  I'd be like, what are you doing?  From the hot tub?  The next day, he talks me into this, and I go, all right, D, I'll go first. 
[03:09:30]  Did he hold your hand as you walked up to his bedroom?  I go in there, and it's next to his bed.  The massage table's next to his bed, and he goes, I had my underwear.  He goes, you know, normally people take their clothes off.  So I take the clothes off, and I'm just laying there.  There's no sheet over me.  Oh, my God.  I'm just naked, raw meat, and he starts getting a little, a little too, a little too much in 
[03:10:00]  between the legs.  Yeah, yeah, hitting the balls with the finger.  Yeah.  Holy fuck.  And then when I had to turn over.  Oh, no.  I was like, I called it quits.  Oh, now you drew the line.  Yeah, I'm like, eh, I'm not comfortable with this side.  And then I went downstairs, and I'm like, you're not going to like that.  And then we left, and we went, and we stayed in a park until nighttime.  We sat there.  We parked next to a creek until nighttime. 
[03:10:30]  We came back in the house, slept, and the next day, we checked out.  But I clearly could have been.  Why didn't you check out that day and just go to a hotel?  We were stuck.  I didn't know where we could.  We were in the middle of nowhere.  We were in, like, Montana, the Grand Tetons we were at.  We were in the middle of nowhere.  Wow.  Shit.  It was horrible.  That guy was fucking just.  He was so close to getting in my bone hole.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I thought he gets a lot of action.  What a trooper you are, though.  After all the asshole tickling, you still turned over for a minute.  Jim's a good egg. 
[03:11:00]  If you would have just, like, perched your ass up a little bit.  Seriously, we would have had a situation.  He'd have slid a digit in there.  Yeah.  He definitely was suspect.  I just remember.  Suspect?  You think?  Geez, wow.  Columbo.  What took you off, though?  You think?  Did he rub it your legs in a hot tub?  Naked.  Naked.  Everyone was naked in a hot tub?  My wife.  That was the weird part.  She called him out, though.  Good for her.  It's a great story.  Yes.  Good for her.  And I didn't, you're weird.  Like, do I punch him out? 
[03:11:30]  Is he really just trying to sell them massages?  Is he trying to get a menage a trois?  Like, what's going on?  Like, I would have thought you'd have said something like, too.  What are you doing, man?  I should have.  I should have.  Yeah, yeah.  Because that isn't even, like, that isn't combative.  It's kind of like, what are you doing?  I might, you know, and that's probably where marijuana can hurt you.  Everything's cool.  Right.  That's all cool.  And this guy's just doing his own thing.  Right.  Right.  Who am I to fucking judge? 
[03:12:00]  Fuck that.  That would make sense.  That would make sense.  Where Nat, if I had a drink or two, he would have been missing teeth.  He would have been missing teeth.  Hey, faggot.  Standing up with my wet nuts.  What's your problem, dog faggot headache?  Hey, you want to see a magic trick?  Hey, your teeth are about to disappear.  Bang!  Hey, here's my weenie. 
[03:12:30]  You want to play hide the baloney?  Huh?  You want a massage?  Guess what?  Let's watch your eyes pop open while I bung you from behold, Doug.  How's that?  How's that for a magic trick?  It's an illusion.  It's an illusion that I'm bunging you from behind, Doug.  We forgot from over there.  Brewer uses smoked pot.  It makes complete sense now.  Now it makes sense.  Yeah, where you're just like, hey. 
[03:13:00]  I was totally into the one hitter.  So, yeah.  I was like, yeah, he's cool, man.  He's just feeling my wife up.  You know, these are my hang-ups.  It's the two out here in Montana.  These are my hang-ups, man.  I don't need to put them on him.  He's the cool guy.  He's the guy that's got it together.  I'm fucked up here.  He obviously knows what's going on here.  There's no reason for rage against Doug.  Oh, fuck that.  Punch him in the face.  Right.  I should have.  You fucking got him.  When did you realize that you checked in?  When did you get the first creepy vibe from Doug? 
[03:13:30]  Right off the bat.  Right.  Right off the bat.  Wow, yeah, huh?  I didn't like him from the beginning.  What did you do that made you not like him?  Was his vibe?  You know what?  First of all, looking like Doug Henning is probably a little creepy.  Right off the bat, they're looking like Doug Henning.  And they were a little too hippie slash earthy for me.  Oh, he had a girl with him?  He did have a girl, but even she was a little suspect.  A lot of granola before granola was in.  Uh-huh.  And so it was like, um, you know, when people shake your hand, you do the limp thing, it 
[03:14:00]  really bothers me.  Yeah, yeah.  It really, like, dude, shake my hand.  Oh, that kind of, yeah.  You think he would have popped your cock in his mouth, though, if you would have let him  go?  I think I would have had a situation.  I think he would have let me dirty his hair.  He would have eaten your ass on that table.  Oh, God.  Jesus, dude.  Yeah.  Oh, that's...  Oh, man.  Oof.  God only knows what shenanigans happens in that house. 
[03:14:30]  Oh, yeah.  You said shenanigans this morning.  I almost pulled over.  I started laughing so hard.  Oh, and he got the right combination of people in there, dude?  You're the first one to say no.  He probably couldn't believe he was there.  You're right.  You're right.  You're the first one that actually went for the naked massage.  Yeah, yeah.  That didn't end up with a fucking cum in his mouth.  He let it go.  Oh, that guy was counting his fucking chickens that day.  Oh, God, yeah.  I got a naked massage.  I'm in.  I bet he was jerking off while he massaged you.  You'd probably feel like, if you look back, he was just rubbing you with one hand. 
[03:15:00]  He was probably plumping his dick up with the other.  Putting that chlorinated smelling lotion on your back.  Yeah.  Rub it in deep.  It's a deep tissue massage.  I bet he sticks close to the table to get his rod against your knuckles.  He cuts my hot stone.  First I dip it in the hot lava, and then I rub it on your back.  Yeah.  You like that massage?  He definitely has a history.  That's great. 
[03:15:30]  Yeah, you don't need any sheets.  Did you guys talk about it afterwards?  Oh, God, no.  No?  No, there was no more.  Oh, me and Dee?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, God, yeah.  She's like, keep down.  I'm like, Dee, you're not going to like that.  She says, she always questions me if something happened, because I never talked.  I just went down and she went out and I'm like, you're not doing it.  Holy fuck, that's great, man.  I'm telling you, we got in a car and we drove to a creek that was close by, and we just stayed 
[03:16:00]  in the car until it got dark.  Now, what was the conversation like there?  Were you just like...  There's a lot of silence.  There's a lot of silence.  There's a lot of silence.  What are we doing?  Yeah, let's look for bears and stuff.  Wow.  It was really weird and creepy.  No shit.  Then I was a little worried at nighttime.  We were the only ones staying at the bed and breakfast.  Was there a lock on your door?  There was, but still.  Yeah.  You could have the key.  Well, that's true.  It's his house.  Right.  We could get in. 
[03:16:30]  But I knew I could physically take him.  Yeah, but you never know if he has a weapon.  That's right.  He could have been an assault weapon.  That's all he did.  Good old laws going on here.  He could.  That's right.  Fuck, man.  Oh, hello there.  Hello, Nicole.  That's, yeah, Nicole.  Yeah, we messed up.  All right, well.  Her rack looks good.  I think we got to do intros for the podcast, all right?  Oh, yeah.  Fuck.  All right.  Let's get that done, then.  New podcast tomorrow morning.  Yes.  Fourth episode.  What do you take?  Best stuff? 
[03:17:00]  A little new stuff.  You hang out here after an hour?  Are you like, what are you doing?  Oh, we don't do that.  Right?  We just fucking.  We got a lot of shit that we just can't play anymore.  So, I mean, just because we don't have the time.  So, putting a couple old ones on the podcast.  Really smart.  I'm sure some of this shit will easily make next week's.  But really smart, the podcast.  Yeah, it's fucking.  It's time.  It's definitely time.  I don't trust these guys in my future.  Oh, this.  I wouldn't. 
[03:17:30]  They've proven time and time again that we can't trust them for our futures.  They don't promote.  At any moment, they'll just fucking pull the plug.  Some big boys playing with some crazy snot rocking money.  Seriously.  They're just like, why don't we just buy this?  See how much money we can make and we'll get rid of it.  Yep.  Where, to us, it's like going to buy a can of soda.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Scott Greenstein, and I was like, let's buy a company.  We'll make $50 million. 
[03:18:00]  Each.  Each.  Yeah, yeah.  And then we'll get rid of it.  Mm-hmm.  And then whatever happens, happens.  And then we'll buy something else.  Spin it off, as they say.  Yeah.  Spin it off.  That's what will happen.  Right toward the black hole.  Yeah, yeah.  And they're already setting that up.  Well, there's a new guy.  We haven't even met him.  I don't even know his name.  The new guy already got rid of me.  Who's this brewer guy?  What's that salary for?  I think Mel left like five, six months ago. 
[03:18:30]  We haven't met the new guy.  He did.  He took the money and ran.  He made a shit.  He's smart.  He made a shitload off this place.  Could you blame him?  No, that's what he does.  I would have done it.  Not me, Jim.  No, I know, Jim.  You wouldn't do that.  What are you doing to look so good?  You look so good.  Thank you.  Just going to the gym.  I got a trainer five days this week.  Oh, you got a trainer?  Two of them.  Two gals.  When I see one, I see the other day.  How do you do that without getting all hopped up?  I do get hopped up.  But it motivates me.  There's one.  I just stare at them while I'm doing my push-ups. 
[03:19:00]  One more.  And I look at the camel toe.  I'm like, okie doke.  One more.  You got it.  Whatever you say.  Whatever you say, madam.  Five days a week, though?  No, this week is five.  I forgot I had one.  I was trying to do four a week, but I forgot that I had one scheduled twice.  So I said, are you available Saturday?  She's like, yeah, so that's five.  That's a lot.  Yeah, it's not normal.  It's a little too much.  What about eating?  Are you eating really good?  Yeah, you could.  I eat grilled chicken and fucking.  You don't drink at all, right?  No, no.  No drinking or drugs.  Yeah, you don't drink or drugs.  Yeah, you're pretty good.  Did you used to drink?  Well, I was a boy. 
[03:19:30]  I have short drinking history when I was a teenager.  No drugs or nothing?  Oh, yeah, a little bit.  A little dabble.  Yeah, a little bit.  Wow.  But since 17, nothing.  18.  18.  18.  18 and a half.  He stopped at 18.  Wow.  He was young.  Wow.  I know.  But he says he just knew.  I've always brought up the subject that's like, how do you know at 18 that you've got  a problem with drinking and drugs?  When you see Doug Henning taking advantage with a water buffalo and whatever else happens.  I don't think there's any 18-year-old that isn't fucked up. 
[03:20:00]  That's true.  If they're doing drinking or doing drugs.  Do your parents drink?  They're both, my dad's sober and my mom never really did drink much.  Huh.  You know, like little indicators, like when the first time you get drunk, you pull a box  cutter on somebody in a supermarket.  You're like, that's not good.  Do they need help opening a box?  Were you being a helpful boy?  I was not being helpful.  Oh, because that would have been helpful.  Like, I'll help you.  I have this here. 
[03:20:30]  I just know.  Is that what you did?  Yeah.  I have zero doubt.  That was a problem.  Wow.  So you're a crazy, angry, mean?  Oh, Jim spilled something.  God, you weren't drinking.  Yeah.  I was a disaster.  I need to smack you.  Wow.  Wow.  But it's nice now that I've taken all of that sabotaging addictive behavior and segued  it into massages and prostitution.  You know, it's good to lead a spiritual life.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[03:21:00]  You know what I mean?  I'm healing people one fucking, one load over their knuckles at a time.  What are you looking at?  Oh, my God.  Dude, look at her, right?  Look at these girls.  That's fucking...  Oh, my God.  Look at this parade.  Of girls.  Girls.  I can see through her dress a little bit.  You guys are all in heat.  It just never ends.  It really doesn't.  All right.  Where's the plugs? 
[03:21:30]  Nordy.  I have one.  Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, July 20th.  Myself.  What's there?  Well, there's a casino there.  Yeah.  I'm with Amy Schumer, Artie Lang, and...  Is that anti-social?  Dave Attell, yeah.  We do them once in a while now, like the one-all, so we can, you know, for the summer, it's  just good to be a gig in.  So tickets are on sale now.  It's almost sold out.  Amy's on fire.  Thank God.  She's on fire.  Fucking on fire.  She's on fire.  And she already got picked up for season two, so...  That's good.  Yeah.  Good for her.  And that little finger thing you did was really cool. 
[03:22:00]  What?  So, the little hand thing with the fingers that you showed a picture of on Instagram.  Do you have a thing with your fingers?  Yeah.  Oh, because apparently somebody just did a Vine video with that.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  I mean, I wouldn't know who that was, but...  Oh, hi.  I'm a couple of fingers or something.  Nice to meet you.  And what's your name, little buddy?  Oh, hi.  I'm a couple of fingers or something.  Chip, you're stealing people's stuff.  And what's your name, little buddy? 
[03:22:30]  Oh, hi.  Oh, my God.  Jesus.  He steals everyone's shit.  I got to do something with lemons.  Yeah.  That's funny.  That's funny.  Brewer, where are you going to be again there, buddy?  It's the special.  Yeah, we're pushing the special.  When do you air?  Friday night.  On Epyx.  Yes.  And epixhd.com.  There you go.  Imagining.  Yeah.  All right.  So, that's where mine is airing in August, and Tom Papa. 
[03:23:00]  And they fucking treat comics good.  They treat comics really well.  It's a good place, man.  And they'll run the shit out of it.  And the fact that it's online, people are like, why don't you do what Louis did?  It's like, well, you don't have to do that.  You can just go to fucking epixhd and watch it.  I didn't even know you could do that.  Yeah.  So, you can do it online.  Wow.  I believe that you're, I'm guessing that's where yours is going to be.  I'm hoping, because I just said that.  I think you're right.  Okay.  Yeah.  And Louis is a different beast.  Yeah.  And he has a site.  Yeah.  I don't have a cult group that'll just like, hey, I'm going online. 
[03:23:30]  Please make me a million dollars.  Yeah.  Right.  You know, people act like everyone could do that.  Louis can do that for a reason.  Aziz, Gaffigan.  There's a few guys that have like an online thing like that.  Aziz didn't pull it off.  What?  I don't think Aziz pulled it off.  I don't know.  I didn't see his, I didn't see it.  Louis is the only one that pulled it off.  Oh, really?  I know Jim did it too, I think.  Yeah.  Maybe Louis might have been the biggest.  Louis was hands down. 
[03:24:00]  Oh, okay.  Louis didn't even have to worry.  I'm also wondering if it's because he was the first one to do it too.  You know what I mean?  I think it's, he's got, he's got a ridiculous following.  Yeah.  If Louis said, I'm going on tour tomorrow and let's his dates, they're going to sell out quick.  Yeah.  His website does a lot of traffic, man.  Yeah.  That's where he does everything.  His demo too, like the people that like him and everything are very computer savvy.  Yeah, they're all kind of miles.  They're right in that fucking, they're right in that fucking area, so.  All right.  Yes, yes.  Thanks for having me. 
[03:24:30]  Fuck, great time.  Jim, fucking always so much fun to have you in.  Come back sooner than later.  No, right?  Two hours.  It's been a while.  Two hours straight.  It's hot, yeah.  It's a busy guy.  It was so great when I used to live here.  Oh, man.  Now I'm like an hour, I'm an hour.  You're far.  I leave, I've been out.  I leave my house.  You're far.  You guys are up early, but like, yeah, I got to leave at 545 to judge the tunnel, to beat  the big traffics and I'm here like 715, 730. 
[03:25:00]  If I leave past a certain time, then I'm. . . .  Then you're fucked.  Then I just. . .  Then I'm. . .  It's so. . .  You know. . .  The traffic's amazing.  Five minutes later. . .  I hate promoting.  I want to be a star so bad.  Yeah.  Just so I don't have to promote anything ever.  Yeah.  I want to be Dwight Gooden.  I can't make it.  Yeah.  He don't give a fuck.  He don't care.  He doesn't.  The book will still sell great.  But I just love this though.  That was fun, dude.  Yeah.  You can't do this on like TV or nothing.  No.  Come back soon.  We're with Jim Brant. 
[03:25:30]  How is. . .  Now when you're in Santa's life. . .  Oh, God.  Really?  All right.  Let's go back 18 years.  18 years.  Wow.  18.  Right?  Something like that.  Dude, I remember going to see Metallica in 97.  I know it's 97 because I met all four of them.  Oh, yeah.  And they all signed my business card.  And they put a date.  So, you know, James, Lars, Kirk, and it was Jason at the time.  Yes.  And they put 97 on it.  Wow.  That's right.  That was where Jim took me.  Yep.  Marianne Faithful was there.  Yes.  Wow. 
[03:26:00]  Yes.  Damn.  Back in the day.  Yeah.  The day.  Did you see the coming tragedies for their film?  I did not, no.  I just saw it this morning.  It looks pretty sick.  I would love to.  Yeah.  It looks pretty sick.  It's not online.  Okay.  Let's see.  I'll check that shit out.  I wish I would have rubbed the brewer's calves while he was talking.  Like fucking Doug Henning.  Yeah.  Brewers got it.  Brewers got it.  Brewers got it.  Brewers got it.  Brewers got it.  I got a lot of calf.  I got a lot of calf.  Very calves.  Very calves.  I got good calves.  Very Hillary.  Did that kind of like concentrate on him?  He didn't make it to my calves. 
[03:26:30]  He didn't make it.  No.  He just concentrated on your ass.  He went straight to me.  It was an ass massage.  Holy shit.  I love it.  Did he do the upper inner thigh by the hamstring?  I don't remember, man.  I really don't.  Exactly.  He blocked it out.  That was so good.  Yeah.  You felt the little finger hit the balls?  Yeah.  I think he started with my back and I just felt the energy too close to my head.  Yeah.  He was hoping I'd lift my head up a little.  Oh, boy.  Put his cock in your mouth.  Oh, he was probably resting right there.  Probably had no underpants on.  He's Doug Henning. 
[03:27:00]  Cloth shorts.  So you can see the outline of the ridge.  He already had his wand.  Yeah.  I'm going to get out of here.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Thanks.  Bye-bye, guys.  Later.  The Opie and Anthony show is available later today with SiriusXM On Demand.  You've heard about it.  You've waited four long hours for it.  Finally, the moment is at hand.  After Opie and Anthony live is coming up next. 
[03:27:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  SiriusXM.  Hey, hey, hey.  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues.  This is After ONA Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  All right.  Here we go.  With After Opie and Anthony Live.  866-WOW1-WOW is the phone number. 
[03:28:00]  I do have an Opie Sudoku puzzle to give away today, so that's very exciting.  For all of you out there who are looking to have something nice to frame on the wall.  A cherished keepsake.  A completed Opie Sudoku.  I guess probably today would have been a little easier, I would think, for Opie to get the Sudoku done.  Because Jim Brewer, I mean, when he comes in, he's got to be among the top five best guests on the show.  I can't think of very many people that are better on this show than Jim Brewer and that are better every time they come in. 
[03:28:30]  And for extended amounts of time.  I mean, he came in on fire at 8 o'clock in the morning and didn't stop until they just got off the air.  There's very few people that they'll even stay late for.  Especially after already talking to him for two hours, but Brewer does it every time, man.  I mean, there were four, I can think of four bits there.  E-Rock, are you sitting there counting while the show's on, like, how many bits there are that you can kind of pull from this? 
[03:29:00]  Jim's one of the best guests because he knows how to segment his stories.  Is that right?  Yeah.  So I can go, okay, that's the story in Australia.  That story about having the guns in the house, someone at the front door.  I guess there is.  There's a beginning and an end.  Yeah.  And once a story begins, the last one is officially over.  So you just cut it.  It's just a clean edit, huh?  Yeah, except for him going back and forth, the gun rant with Anthony.  That's just going to be a whole thing.  Well, I counted four bits today. 
[03:29:30]  How many did you count for Brewer?  Can I see those logs again first?  Thank you.  Let's see.  I have his daughter dating, dealing with kids and punishments.  Okay.  You know what?  I have five bits then.  I didn't even think of his daughter dating.  Losing space in your house in Parenthood.  I thought that goes along with the raising kids.  I guess I was thinking more broad.  All right.  We can put there.  Let's see.  Him talking about getting fired from Sirius XM.  Australia, the shooting of the guns. 
[03:30:00]  Here's what I got.  Jim Brewer raising kids, one.  I'm thinking big, fun, good bits.  I mean, they could be 45 minutes long.  Jim Brewer raising kids.  Because the Ant versus Jim Brewer argument was one of the best things I've ever heard in my life.  Yep, I have that here.  I mean, just because of the – because you're looking at it from a few elements.  Number one, there aren't a lot of people that can come at Ant as strong as Ant comes at them.  You don't really – that's why those arguments with Ant don't happen very often.  Because Ant is very good at arguing his points. 
[03:30:30]  So it's a rare personality that can come in and kind of take over with their point of view without – and Brewer can do it.  So you had that going on.  Plus, you know, they're laughing at each other.  They're taking breaks to laugh at each other the whole time.  And Norton is over there in his element just going, ooh.  He hasn't done that a while.  But he loves doing that.  Whoa.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  The whole time just instigating it further.  So, yeah, I had Jim Brewer raising kids. 
[03:31:00]  Ant versus Jim Brewer.  Then Jim talking about his honeymoon at the Dude Ranch.  And that Dude Ranch is insane.  Like, when I was in – I went to public school.  So it's not like one of these hoity-toity private school trips.  Public school where, you know, at the end of fifth grade, you get to go on a day trip.  Like, that's the big fifth grade.  You're graduating from elementary school.  Your day trip is.  And we went to the Dude Ranch.  The Brewer thought it would be a good idea to go on for his honeymoon. 
[03:31:30]  So we were there.  So I had Brewer's honeymoon.  And then, of course, the retelling of the bed and breakfast story was killer.  Eddie the Trucker.  Hey, I could think of a way better appearance on the Opie and Anthony show.  And that's Sammy the Sweetheart Roberts, the professional broadcaster.  I forget sometimes, Eddie.  As humble as I am, sometimes I forget.  I'm glad that there are people like you to remind me of reality.  I've got to remind you of that. 
[03:32:00]  Hey, can I get a Sudoku puzzle, my friend, and a mixtape?  Eddie, after that phone call, you can get whatever you want.  Whatever you want.  Hold on, okay?  Thank you.  All right.  You get the Sudoku, and we'll send him a mixtape as well.  Roland, you know when you're booking Jim Brewer.  Oh, yeah.  Easy day.  Yeah, it's a great day.  Although, where are we at with Dwight Gooden?  I don't know.  I'm waiting to hear back from his rep.  Do you think, Roland? 
[03:32:30]  Yes.  You've been doing talent booking for a long time.  Now, we were supposed to have Dwight Gooden in studio today.  Yes.  Did not happen, did it?  I got a little bag.  A little bag?  Yeah, of dicks.  And where did they go?  Right in my ass.  Okay.  You got a little bag of dicks in the ass.  That's the way it went down.  I have to ask you.  Yeah.  Are we getting Marino'd again?  Is it a possibility?  It is, and the hard part is, if it does come through, we're getting tight with guests in the next three days. 
[03:33:00]  Yeah, what kind of guests do we have coming in the next three days?  Ethan Hawke, Daily Roth, Tomorrow.  Jesus Christ, that's a great show.  Yeah, and then we have, then Thursday's getting tight, and then Friday's Barbecue Day.  And you don't want to announce, we got other guests, but you don't want to announce them, I'm assuming.  The one I don't, well, Rob Delaney's coming in.  Oh, Mr. Twitter.  Mr. Twitter.  And then the other two I didn't want to announce just yet.  Right.  But it just.  Big guests?  Yeah.  Very exciting. 
[03:33:30]  It's just like fitting everything in and having, giving the guys enough breathing room to do their stuff too.  Do you think we're going to get blown off though?  Do you think this is a problem that you're going to have to deal with?  I think worst case scenario, you're going to interview Mr. Dr. Gooden right here on Thursday.  Jeez, I don't want to interview him.  What do I got to talk to him about?  Just tell him about my pain.  He's Dr. K.  Dr. K?  I don't even know, what's that for cocaine?  No, that was his nickname.  Drug reference?  He used to strike out a lot of people.  Oh, I thought he did Special K.  And on CBS this morning, they said he was so high on cocaine, he missed the World Series parade. 
[03:34:00]  Is that right?  That's alleged.  You don't know that.  All right, well let me ask him then, bring him in here.  It was on CBS this morning.  He said that.  They said that on the air?  Yeah, it's on his book.  Oh, okay.  It's probably in his book, not on his book.  On his book, yeah.  On his book.  He said it was his biggest regret because they won the World Series and he said he was high somewhere.  Getting high on coke.  Well, I mean, I think he'd be a great guest.  I just wonder because last week we were supposed to have Marino and he was booked solid. 
[03:34:30]  He was.  And then the same thing happened the night before.  Or we get an email from Roland that says, Dan Marino is going to have to postpone his performance.  He'll get back with you guys and we'll figure out a new date.  Yeah.  That new date did not happen.  No, but.  So that's what makes me think.  And he was coming in too serious outside of the O&A show for something else.  And he did that.  And Dwight Gooden is still doing that.  I was very sad because I, the dumb Marino, I get reminded.  Did you just call him dumb Marino?  Yeah. 
[03:35:00]  Because it reminds me every day when I go to your office, I see those helmets.  Yeah.  You know, there's helmets.  Obi's in-laws had helmets.  Jim had a helmet.  Everybody was very excited for it.  So this Dwight Gooden thing, I kind of, can I tell you what I see happening?  Marino too.  I think so.  You think so, don't you?  I think so.  You think so?  I'm glad you're being honest.  You think.  I am hungover and tired.  I think, yeah.  You think.  I could hear her going, oh my God, you won't believe what's going to happen. 
[03:35:30]  Right.  Blah, blah, blah in the morning.  I know we're going to be serious tomorrow at X time.  In the afternoon.  I wish we had time.  Let me go back and recheck his schedule for next week.  And next week, I know he's in LA, not in New York.  So that she's going to go, oh my God.  And that'll be the old, turn off the phone.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So that's what I was like.  Wow.  I'm on the pay no mind list right now.  You are?  Yeah, he's just like, ah.  You can't do athletes rolling.  It's not your specialty.  It's not.  It's just hard for public because they have nothing to gain. 
[03:36:00]  The athletes themselves?  Yeah.  Well, they could say they're selling books.  Yeah, I mean, books.  Yeah.  But some, the athletes are tough people though to get sometimes.  Plus, apparently, they have horrible publicists like this, what's his name?  No, I mean, it's just.  Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, remember?  Oh, yeah.  That was a rough one.  Larry in South Carolina.  Sam Roberts, professional broadcaster.  What's up, buddy?  Are intern screening calls, Eric?  No, they're all getting their building IDs right now.  Oh, okay.  I was about to say, what are they all doing? 
[03:36:30]  But it's again, building IDs.  What are we going to do, Larry?  What are we going to do?  Well, Sam, I'll tell you what you're going to do.  I don't know why you're sweating Dwight Gooden because you did a great job with Cal Ripken.  And this is for Eric Nagel.  There it is.  Perfect call.  Thank you, Larry.  You're right.  Well, here's the thing.  I did a great job with Cal Ripken, but then what's his name?  Kurt Schilling.  Kurt Schilling came to me saying, Sam, I have this great idea.  I'm going to sell video games.  I'm going to start a video game company. 
[03:37:00]  I'm going to invest all my money into it, and I'm going to sell video games.  I need to get an interview with you so that you can inform the people and you can get word out there that this is happening.  I need you to tell the people that I'm selling video games so I don't go broke.  And I said, Kurt Schilling, I'll do that for you.  You know what it did for him?  Nothing.  Yeah, it did.  Buck kissed.  Yeah, it bankrupted him.  And I don't want Doc Gooden to go bankrupt, Roland.  I think he's almost there.  How? 
[03:37:30]  Well, it's funny.  The woman at CBS, I go, you used to have an 11-room mansion.  He goes, yes, yes, but we're here in your two-bedroom apartment.  Ouch.  Ouch.  And then he's like, oh, yeah.  Well, the drugs were probably rough for him.  He's probably doing better now.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  He's sobered up and everything.  I do have to wonder.  One of my favorites.  I love that it's summer.  I love that in the summer, fast food companies start pushing out all their new products.  And they've gotten to this point. 
[03:38:00]  We were talking about it a little bit on the show today.  They've gotten to this point where they're just pushing things out that will kill people because they know news will cover that.  Like, this is crazy.  That's like when KFC came out with their, what was it, the Double Down, I think is what it was called?  The Chickenator?  Eric, did anybody call that sandwich the Chickenator?  Roland did.  Roland called it the Chickenator.  It was the sandwich where it was, instead of having bread, you had two breaded fried chicken patties with bacon and cheese. 
[03:38:30]  I thought it was called the KFC Double Down.  Apparently, it was called the Chickenator.  Yeah.  But, yeah, so that was last year's big thing.  And it got all kinds of press.  So now this year, first I thought the thing, it turned out to be a goof.  Yesterday, I don't know if you guys saw this, but yesterday, Burger King's viral thing was the hands-free Whopper container.  Yeah, I thought that was a goof.  Yeah, it turned out to be a goof.  But all the news were reporting it as that they had, like, done it as a promo thing in Puerto Rico and that they were bringing it to the States. 
[03:39:00]  Obviously, Burger King just put out a fake news story and everybody just glommed on to it.  The news was like, okay, yeah, we'll talk about food.  Like, anytime there's bad food, anytime there's something that's bad for you, the news would be like, look at this funny story.  It was on every channel yesterday and it was just a goof.  But I would probably get it because I think you could probably just have a chicken sandwich in there.  Or if you're doing the board, you just, like, start eating them.  Who does the board?  You. 
[03:39:30]  You weren't talking about me, Roland.  I would use it, too.  You don't know how to run the board.  Eric, you know he was talking about you just now.  Yep.  I don't like that.  Did you see the Whopper hands-free deal?  Yeah, it looks stupid.  You wouldn't get it if it actually existed?  No.  Imagine that, though.  You're sitting there playing Xbox.  Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.  There's a Whopper right there in front of you.  You just bend down and eat it.  That's just too lazy.  Or if you're taking a shit, you're like, I don't know.  What do you think of the, uh...  I don't know.  He's eating a Whopper while he's taking a shit.  Yeah, it's just like a full cycle thing. 
[03:40:00]  It's a very cyclical deal.  You're saving time.  That's right.  I mean, literally, if you eat the whole Whopper on the toilet, I'll bet the first bite's coming out before the last bite is finished.  I agree.  You think so, too, right?  Yeah.  Although you can use your hands when you're on the toilet.  So what are you doing?  You're sitting on the toilet, dropping a deuce, eating a Whopper, and reading a magazine.  Or your iPad.  Oh, right.  You can be candy crushing.  You're candy crushing, eating a Whopper, and shitting.  Yeah.  You get a lot done.  You're a very productive guy, Roland.  You eat lunch, shit, and do all your stuff, and then you leave. 
[03:40:30]  Right.  Now, Roland, you like the finer things in life.  Yeah.  Not me so much.  So I get very excited by this fast food stuff.  Eric, you go back and forth.  What do you, what's your, you're a food connoisseur.  What's your opinion on this Dunkin' Donuts sandwich?  Did you see it?  Yeah, it looks horrible.  It's a glazed donut.  It's like a bacon, egg, and cheese.  Except there's no cheese.  And instead of putting it on a roll or a bagel, it's on a glazed donut.  They cut a glazed donut in half, put one of those egg patties in it, and throw some bacon. 
[03:41:00]  The only way that could be good, the donut has to be warm.  Warm.  Yeah, because...  And they're never warm at Dunkin' Donuts, though.  No.  That's why you don't like it.  Yeah.  If it wasn't for the egg, I would probably try it.  I don't really eat egg.  There's places around the country that do it with hamburgers, just with the donuts.  A donut in a hamburger?  Have you tasted it?  No, but I've seen it on Food Network or something like that.  They show it to you where they have the glazed donuts, and they make the hamburger just that  it's on a donut.  What, did Guy Fieri taste it?  Probably.  That sounds like a very D, D, and D, and D, and D, and D, and D type thing. 
[03:41:30]  They had to, at first, at the Google cafeteria.  They had what at the Google cafeteria?  The Krispy Kreme burger donut.  That's horrible, to put in a company's cafeteria.  I would think that Google would be like, no, we are not going to have this product in our  company cafeteria.  It's obviously horrible for you.  No?  No.  You don't think so?  Probably good.  You tell me.  If Sirius XM, in their kitchen, if we had a bigger kitchen. 
[03:42:00]  You mean a normal kitchen with better selections?  I know that you're particular about your foods.  Without having, like, rods of pretzels with no...  They're not rods of pretzels.  They're pretzel rods.  They're not rods.  I'll have the rod at de pretzel.  But they're all, like, in a bunch.  Rod of pretzels?  They're a bunch where you just grab by your hand...  Yeah, but that's not a bunch of rods.  You wouldn't call it a rod.  Like, when you pick up a group of sticks, you don't say, look, I have a stick of sticks  here. 
[03:42:30]  It's a bundle.  Oh, whatever.  Tomato, tomato.  Yeah, look at this.  I have a rod of rods.  Well.  All right, what do you got?  Best lessons.  So, if we had a rod of pretzels.  What's he talking about?  I'm hungover.  If we had...  No, you're not hungover.  You just have a large block between...  There's a block between your brain and your mouth that exists somewhere.  I don't know.  Maybe it's because you eat such ridiculous foods.  Maybe it's full of cronut dough.  I don't know.  I hope so. 
[03:43:00]  I don't know.  But there's something.  There's a huge blockage that horribly affects your communication skills.  That said, if we had guest chefs here at SiriusXM and they said, yeah, we're making  Krispy Kreme burgers.  Would you have one?  I'd say medium well, please.  Would you try a Krispy Kreme burger?  No.  You wouldn't?  No.  Why?  I'm not a donut pastry fan.  A lot of that dessert stuff is not really...  You don't like the sweet stuff?  He doesn't eat them. 
[03:43:30]  It's not like I would never eat it, but I wouldn't go to it.  You might have a bite.  If they had them here.  If you got the cronuts in here, I would try a bite because it's something I've never  had, but I would never really eat that.  I got you.  You're not a dessert guy.  You like to heavy up on the meal, not so much the dessert.  Yeah.  You have a second and third helping for yourself because there's no saving room.  Steak on steak.  I double down.  I go for the dessert and the fucking meal.  Steak on steak on steak.  Yeah.  You're like, well, Iraq's having this big reserving.  I will too.  And then the dessert comes and you're like, well, yeah, I'm going to have dessert.  Dinner always turns into a competition with Roland. 
[03:44:00]  It does.  You had more than I did, so I got to order another entree.  Without realizing, yeah.  I'm having three entrees, but I'm also going to be getting two desserts.  Tom on Long Island.  Hey, what's going on?  What's up, buddy?  So over in Vegas, I believe it's called the Heart Attack Cafe.  It's a burger that's there.  It's like 10 inches.  And it's burger on top, burger, cheese, donuts.  It's seriously disgusting.  What's that?  Have you had it, Roland?  No, but I think that's the same place where you get chicken fried steak, gravy, biscuits 
[03:44:30]  and gravy, and another chicken fried steak, and then more gravy.  Have you eaten there?  Yeah.  It's called the Heart Attack Cafe, and you're an overweight man.  Why would you eat there?  I just went there.  That was years ago.  Oh, so you're skinny, probably in college, UNLV is where you went.  It was a cafe similar to that, but it wasn't called the Heart Attack Cafe, but it's the  same premise.  Same type of deal.  Yeah.  Richmond in Arizona, your name's Richmond?  No, no, no, man.  I think they got it messed up.  It's called Rich.  Oh, Rich in Arizona.  Richmond.  I don't want Richmond. 
[03:45:00]  Well, Rich must be short for Richmond.  Yeah, Spotted T.  Yeah.  Richmond, yeah.  Yeah, man, that sandwich with the glazed donut.  Yeah.  I think that's called the Luther, man.  The Luther?  Yeah, yeah.  I think Luther Vandross made that up.  Really?  Yeah, yeah, really.  Didn't work out well for Luther Vandross.  I think he made it up in his bigger days, man.  His fat Luther.  Yeah, I would imagine it wasn't while he was dieting. 
[03:45:30]  He did, the Luther Burger.  And what is the Luther Burger exactly?  It's, uh, yeah, there it is.  A homemade Luther Burger on a grilled Krispy Kreme donut.  And it's this huge wad of meat with cheese, bacon, and I think, I don't know if those are  sweet potato fries or not.  Wow.  With it and on it, but it's there.  I'm going to download a Luther song and need one.  And on it?  It might just be the way the picture is.  I don't think it might be on it.  It might just be a side dish.  Yeah.  My God, can you imagine being that famous that you're like, okay, well, I'm going to 
[03:46:00]  be fat, but I'm really going to embrace this.  I'm going to enjoy my meals.  He came up with the idea in 1979.  He's ahead of his time.  He's not ahead of his time.  He's a genius.  Well, backstage to perform a concert in Indianapolis, a hungry Luther Vandross ordered burgers for  himself and his crew, but there weren't enough buns supplied by the catering company.  Um, Luther's personnel didn't have time to order new buns.  So they improvised by cutting up donuts and putting the burgers on the donuts. 
[03:46:30]  And he says, I will call, he says, I call it the Luther burger.  Isn't it amazing?  It's amazing how much things have changed because now you look around and women and celebrities  will get a burger, but they'll eat it without the bun.  You've seen people do that, right?  It's in an album, the protein burger, they call it.  Right.  They don't want the carbs.  Right.  They don't want the carbs.  They're skipping carbs.  Atkins diet.  Luther.  Exactly.  Luther Vandross goes, well, we don't have buns.  Not only is that, that's so unacceptable that I will replace it with something that's even 
[03:47:00]  more bread than a bun and a glaze over it.  And then hold it up and announce to the crew that I call it, it's in quotes, I call it the  Luther burger.  He's a genius.  You think so?  Yes.  You would try a Luther burger.  I wish he was alive to give him a hug.  Well, you know why he's not alive?  Because he eats fucking hamburgers on donuts.  He shouldn't be alive.  Since the late 70s.  Yeah.  He's a good run.  The fact, you think if you get a run in, you do what it means? 
[03:47:30]  No, I mean, he has a long life.  The fact that he lived as long as he did means that God blessed him for some reason.  Yeah.  Because there's no, that's totally unacceptable.  He doesn't have to eat.  I like this guy.  He died in 2005 at the age of 54.  No, 54.  So he did not have a long life at all.  He shouldn't have made 50, quite frankly, if that's what he's eating all the time.  I got to tell you, I made the mistake of looking in the mirror yesterday after I got out of the  shower.  Horrible.  Just horrible. 
[03:48:00]  I'm a skinny guy, but I can't let go of these bad foods.  Like I can't, I can't stop eating them.  Like Jess is out of town on business.  And so I was having this conversation with Nicole.  Why don't you come over to my place?  She was like, no, I'm just kidding.  I was talking about dinner.  Like, what am I eat?  Because the last time Jess was out of town, I don't take care of myself.  I'm no good at it.  I don't know.  I still, the place already, she's been gone for 12 hours and it looks like a college dorm  room.  Nothing gets cleaned.  The cat's litter box is disgusting.  It's horrible. 
[03:48:30]  It's just, if anybody came over, they'd take the cat away and move me.  I'd be evicted.  But last time Jess was gone, I'm sitting there going, okay, it's probably like 830 at night.  I usually eat about seven and I'm very hungry and going, oh, that's right.  Dinner didn't happen.  So I'm looking around and I'm going, okay, I'll make some chicken.  Just throw some chicken on the foreman.  That's a nice healthy dinner, right?  So I put the chicken on the foreman and grill it up and everything.  Just plain.  And I go, okay, I'm going to eat healthy tonight.  Which the real reason I'm eating healthy is because I'm lazy. 
[03:49:00]  I don't know how to make anything else except to just take these chicken breasts that are  in the fridge and slap them on the foreman.  Which way is Sal's pizza?  That's all the way in Marinac.  That's like a half hour away.  I mean 20 minutes away.  So I'm sitting and I go, I get the chicken out.  I got the plate and I realize the only thing that's on my plate is two chicken breasts.  And I have to find a side, right?  You have to find a side dish or you're not.  One or two.  You're not eating a well-rounded meal.  Yeah.  I'm looking in the fridge.  I don't see anything.  I don't know how to make anything.  You just eat raw potatoes. 
[03:49:30]  We didn't have any potatoes.  Otherwise, I swear to God, if we had a sack of potatoes, that's all it would have taken.  Peel that shit, run it under cold water.  Eat raw.  Have you ever had a raw potato?  No.  You should try it.  You should try it.  They're crunchy.  They're delicious.  They're a little starchy.  Yeah.  But they're delicious.  Yeah, watch myself.  Just because you cook them doesn't mean there's less starch in them.  He'll have the Luther burger, but he won't eat a raw potato.  Yeah, exactly.  Raw potato?  Not unless you put it between two glazed donuts. 
[03:50:00]  So what did I do for my side dish?  Popcorn.  I decided that that was a suitable side at the time, put it in the microwave, because  I said, some people, they boil corn.  Some people cook corn.  Some people prefer their corn to be popped.  So I had popcorn and chicken that night.  And so from then on, it's been like, Jess has been like, I don't know what you do.  I worry about you.  So Nicole is telling me, go to Whole Foods.  That's what I was about to say.  What were you going to say?  Do you have a Whole Foods near you? 
[03:50:30]  It's somewhat near.  Yeah, because you just go and have a buffet.  It's like healthy food.  And it's good food, right?  Yeah, it's clean.  Do you like Captain Crunch?  Yeah, I like Captain Crunch.  You can get your chicken breast, dip it in the batter, and then roll it in Captain Crunch  and bake it.  Do you think I'm there?  Yeah, but do you think I'm there?  Like, I just told you that I put chicken on a form and ate it with microwave popcorn.  It may be steps.  You could do this.  But I had every intention of going like, okay, I'm going to eat it at Whole Foods.  And then I looked at my body in the mirror, you know? 
[03:51:00]  And even though I'm a skinny guy, I eat all this bad food.  And it's just like, it just collects in odd places.  It looks very Roswellian, like a Roswell alien body.  Because I'm still lanky and stuff.  And obviously you can see my arms are skinny.  But just like little paunches in the belly and in the tit area and right above the ass.  Like the ass is still completely flat.  But then like right above in the hip area, you can just see little pockets of fat building.  But that wasn't enough for me.  For some reason, I still was like, huh, got to have dinner. 
[03:51:30]  Maybe I'll go to Whole Foods.  Or we could get cheesy bread and pizza from Domino's.  And so that's what it was.  I can't stop doing it.  You're going to get fat.  I know.  I'm worried about it.  Because I can't.  I'm like, okay.  I'll walk you through this.  You will.  Yeah, it's cool.  We'll get there.  Because I can't stop eating bad foods.  And at first it was like, I'll do it like once a week or something.  And then it was like just the weekend.  Then it was like, well, once during the week.  And the weekends is fine.  And then it was just like it. 
[03:52:00]  And the older you get, it's harder to change your habits.  Right.  And it'll be like, oh, we're going to.  Jess will be late.  I told you yesterday, Jess was late coming home from work.  And I'm like, I'll call the diner and get us food.  What do you want?  She's like, oh, I have like a falafel salad thing that's good for you.  And I'm like, okay.  Now get my usual.  Chicken fingers and fries.  Because to me, that sounds nutritious.  It's not.  But you don't use a dip.  So you're kind of saving calories there.  You think?  Because I don't put honey mustard on it. 
[03:52:30]  It's good for me.  Do you use ketchup?  No.  See, that's high fructose.  So you're saving that too.  You're right, Roland.  I'm going to go to Roland for my nutrition.  No, don't listen to him.  Why?  He's giving me good advice.  Yeah.  Roland, believe me, I've gone out to eat with Roland.  Roland doesn't.  There's no holds barred with Roland.  Do you think he would go for the Luther Burger?  Yeah.  See, that's where I'm lucky.  Because we've gone over my weird food things before.  Like I don't eat red meat, so I don't eat burgers.  So I feel like I save a lot there.  And Roland would talk me in. 
[03:53:00]  Here's what Roland does to me.  We had our fat night that one night.  Oh, yeah.  Your fat night that one night.  Roland will go to me.  He'll go to me.  Hey, you want to go try this out?  And I'll be like, I don't know, man.  He'll be like, I got you.  Dinner's on me tonight.  And then I'm like, all right.  Why not?  You got to hang with Roland.  And then he'll get dinner.  And then he'll just order like fucking everything.  And then it's there.  And he's paying for it.  So it's like, well, I might as well eat with you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean.  That's how he gets to have an accomplice.  So you have to curb how often you go to dinner with Roland is what you're telling me. 
[03:53:30]  Yeah.  I mean, if it's dangerous and living here in the city, it's just it's it's bad.  Yeah.  And we found this barbecue place.  It's it's like my new shit right now.  That's what I'm saying.  You find these foods and they're so delicious.  And I was hanging out with Jess over the weekend and a friend of her mom's who's like super into nutrition.  Like he lives 70 70 miles away from Jess's parents.  And he bikes to them.  What?  Yeah.  He rides his bike and be like, hey, what's up?  He goes, can I take a quick shower before we eat? 
[03:54:00]  You know, because he just rides his bike 70 miles.  Good for him.  But he does it.  And he like.  Yeah.  Fuck.  And then he makes food like he makes all his own food and everything's organic.  And he was like, you know, I saw a T-shirt once and it says nothing tastes as good as skinny feels.  Yeah.  That's what's her name.  That's some model said that.  Yeah.  Well, guess what?  I disagree vehemently.  No, I mean, it feels good when you feel thin.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm putting you when you don't look in the mirror and go, oh, my God.  Like, oh, look at my fucking tits.  Right.  Right. 
[03:54:30]  So are you out of our barbecue outing that's coming up soon?  No, I'm in.  You got to be in.  But see, here's what happens that I have to fucking when I do this.  Like, I was just in Memphis and I was like, OK, when I'm down here, like, I need to eat  barbecue every single fucking meal and biscuits and everybody down south is fucking fat.  Right.  And I know why.  Yeah, of course, dude.  Everybody eats like it's a like it's a Cracker Barrel every day.  Yeah.  Did you have chicken fried steak?  No, but I had like brisket.  I had pulled pork barbecue dry, wet rub. 
[03:55:00]  I mean, you fucking name it.  I had it.  I don't know how it happened, but my parents are both like they're just naturally skinny  people like you, madam.  They're not fat people, but they're also not they don't exercise.  They're just not they're just naturally not fat.  But both their families are from Kentucky.  So that's the kind of cooking they raised with.  That's the kind of cooking my mom does.  Jess came over the first time and she's like and her parents are completely like East  Coast, you know, sort of, you know, new thinking, blah, blah, blah.  Let's do this. 
[03:55:30]  Let's do that.  Let's try this.  Let's try that.  My parents are very much like this is the way it is.  Right.  We have a better killer spread.  Right.  We cook with butter.  That's what we do.  Yeah, we've been doing it and we're going to keep doing it.  And the first time Jess ate at my parents house, what the fuck is going on here?  You can't eat like this.  I was like, I ate like this every single night.  Yeah.  You know?  Yeah.  You're not going to be able to turn back now.  Well, and I go through these kicks of like, you know, exercise, because if I can exercise,  first of all, if you exercise, you unconsciously, I think, will eat better. 
[03:56:00]  Yes.  Because you don't want to mess up your shit.  You'll still eat bad sometimes.  Yeah.  But not as often.  And you can justify it a little bit better.  And, you know, eating bad and not exercising versus eating bad and exercising is a huge difference.  You're saying Roland is more the first.  Well.  But, so I'll go through these, and Roland's not even arguing.  He's like, I don't do that.  I do walk by my gym and do a little chat out.  What about your bike, Roland?  Well, I have new restaurants.  Roland told me in February he's getting a bike.  He's not doing that. 
[03:56:30]  He's not going to do it.  But.  I rent those shitty city banks.  No, you're not.  I go through these spats of exercising and not exercising.  Like, I'll go and I'll be running like four times a week.  And there'd be a big difference.  But I'm now in the sort of frame of not exercising.  Come to me.  And eating worse.  But don't you feel better when you exercise?  Yeah.  But then you have to.  So why don't you just force yourself to do it?  You know what I did the other day?  I drive home.  I take the Bronx River Parkway, which is a highway here.  It was closed.  So you take a detour and take some side streets home. 
[03:57:00]  Well, I'm taking the side streets.  There's a Taco Bell on the way.  Yeah, I've already had lunch.  But if I just get a chicken quesadilla, that's fine.  Or a beef mexican.  They're a little small.  You're going to be a fatso.  You think so?  Oh, yeah.  You see it coming.  I see it coming.  Oh.  I don't know.  Corey.  Hey, in Canada, at Burger King, you're able to buy something called a poutine.  You can get it a meal.  Poutine?  Ooh.  Yeah.  That's cheese curds, fries, and gravy.  And you can also get a bacon poutine.  Wow.  I think the sodium level is, like, triple what – I think it's, like, triple the daily 
[03:57:30]  recommended ingredients.  But it's also – like, I'm okay because I don't eat gravy, but I will get the cheese  fries.  And I always get fucked because Jess goes, why don't we get cheese fries to split?  And I go, okay.  And Jess is a beautiful girl.  And she knows what she's doing.  So she'll have three cheese fries.  Three off the plate.  And I'm like, yeah, we're just sharing them.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  It's all catching up.  I'm 30 in June, July, like, three or four months.  Yeah.  Well, but this is worse than the cheese curds. 
[03:58:00]  I'm not doing the cheese curds.  I'm getting carried away.  You know what I need to do?  My parents are both fat.  So, like, I have the potential to be fat.  So I need to get that biped, that surgery that shrinks your stomach.  You want to get it done now.  I'm not kidding you.  You want to get it done in advance.  I would do it right now if I could.  I've honestly been thinking about looking into it.  Just that way I'm not even fucking hungry.  Do other fat people hate Troy?  Why?  Because you're doing it earlier, like, boo.  Well, I'm just, it's one of those steps to prevent it from being a fucking fatso. 
[03:58:30]  Yeah.  And get a goddamn bike, will you?  You think if I get a bike, it'll help?  Well, it helps.  You put on some good music.  What's better, biking or running?  Well, running's bad for your joints and your knees.  I enjoy doing it.  I like it, but I can't do it every day because I start, you know, I have pain.  But, like, with the bike, put on some good music, just go for a fucking haul.  Maybe I get a bicycle.  Eric, what do you do to stay in such good shape?  I end the show.  All right.  Goodbye, everybody. 
[03:59:00]  Rod and Fezzard next.  O.P. and Anthony's show is now over.  For real this time.  Check out the O&A show on Facebook and Facebook.com. </pre>
