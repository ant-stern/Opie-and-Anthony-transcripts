<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, jumping between movie reviews, personal anecdotes, current events, and celebrity gossip.  The show began with a discussion of movies, including critiques of *Jack Reacher*, *Bourne Legacy*, and a poorly-made *Star Wars* fan film, which prompted much mockery from Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton.  They also discussed Red Letter Media's movie reviews and copyright issues on YouTube, along with Jim Norton's recurring dreams and opinions on *Homeland* and Graham Norton's talk show.

The conversation then shifted to television, focusing on Andy Cohen's *Watch What Happens Live*, *Homeland*, and *The Walking Dead*.  A significant portion detailed Jim Norton's preparations for his new advice radio show, including the challenges of creating a tagline and the difficult, sometimes disturbing, listener questions he received, including those relating to suicide. This segued into a discussion of the 12-12-12 concert, featuring commentary on the performers, particularly Kanye West.  They then recounted their disastrous experience hosting "XFL Game Day," sharing anecdotes about Vince McMahon and criticizing the XFL's lack of planning.  The segment concluded with a discussion of the George Zimmerman-Trayvon Martin case and a separate elevator robbery, analyzing both through the lens of racial stereotypes and media bias, with frank and often offensive commentary about race relations.

The next segment delved into racial crime statistics and perceived media bias, further discussing the Trayvon Martin case and Zimmerman's 911 call.  One host recounted a frustrating experience calling 911 about a stolen bus. The Australian radio DJs' prank call and subsequent tragedy prompted a conversation about radio pranks, including the hosts' own past offensive and potentially illegal stunts.  This transitioned into personal anecdotes about masturbation, childhood experiences with pornography, and the evolution of pornography consumption from print magazines like *Cosmopolitan* and *Penthouse* to readily available online content.  The segment concluded with reminiscences about early AOL experiences, including chat rooms and online impersonations, and a suggestion for a new anti-accidental texting app.

The following segment began with a discussion of accidental text messages, including Jim Norton's embarrassing sexting mishap with Bob Saget.  This led to conversations about financial security and celebrity victims of theft, a lack of female presence in the studio, and recollections of past female guests (including a picture of Norton sniffing Gina Lynn's ass).  Norton's romantic woes were discussed at length in vulgar terms.  The conversation then shifted to music, focusing on the fleeting popularity of 90s and 2000s bands and a parody idea of Gangnam Style.  They discussed the "Modern Seinfeld" Twitter account and a bizarre, increasingly offensive anecdote about a forgotten cheesecake belonging to Norton’s black friend.  This was followed by more discussion on celebrities’ financial troubles, focusing on Lindsay Lohan and Stephen Baldwin, with vulgar commentary on Lohan's appearance and behavior, and a review of her performance in a movie portraying Elizabeth Taylor.  The segment concluded with a discussion about Psy's music video and Norton mentioning a need for “Jimmy’s plugs.”

The final segments covered various topics.  They discussed the evolution of email, the challenges of social media, and the unreliability of celebrity personas.  This was followed by a discussion about one host's upcoming stand-up shows, a "cheesecake exchange," and the hosts’ home entertainment setups.  A significant portion involved anecdotes about a night out with Roland, involving heavy alcohol consumption and Jesse May Peluso's antics, with explicit descriptions of her behavior.  Roland shared stories from his time working for Carson Daly, using explicit language to describe Daly's social life and relationships.  Roland recounted jumping into a Bellagio fountain in Las Vegas, being tackled by security and getting banned, mentioning JT as a witness. The show concluded with a discussion of future plans, specifically an upcoming trip to Las Vegas for heavy drinking and partying, emphasizing their excitement and plans "to tear shit up" before Christmas.  The final announcement stated that Ryan and Fez were next.  Throughout the entire broadcast, no guests appeared in the studio besides the regular hosts.

[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  And this is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Never before has one radio show been so extreme.  Thank you. 
[00:04:00]  Are we on the air?  No, we are.  Oh, okay.  Quite simply, the greatest show in the history of broadcasting.  O-N-A every day, that's what I say.  Are you guys having a good time or what?  Yeah, rules are destroyed, and conventions burn to the ground. 
[00:04:30]  Would you like to make a good time or what?  Would you like to make some fucking second?  With Opie, the destroyer.  I would eat Petty White's ass.  He's 90, right?  It doesn't smell too bad.  Anthony, the rage.  Holy fuck, how much more fair, how much more fair you want to cry to these people up my ass all the time trying to get me to hell.  Fuck you.  And Jim Norton, lover of the transgender.  Every time a transsexual walks in the room, party horn should go off.  Surprise!  It's the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:05:00]  Strap in, dicks.  This one's gonna hurt.  Double guns, bitch.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Hey.  Strap in, bitch.  Hi, everybody.  Welcome.  Welcome.  Opie and Anthony program.  Yes, it is. 
[00:05:30]  Hi, Jimmy.  Hi, buddy.  There it is.  Just kicked in.  I look like such an asshole when I sleep with my stupid chin strap.  Do you have your little chin strap on last night?  And a mouth guard.  How did it work last night?  Did you sleep?  It's weird.  I'm not getting good sleep, but I'm sleeping through the night.  Like, I might be up once during the night instead of four or five times.  I don't know what it's doing.  What's not good sleep?  Are your eyes flittering a lot?  Do you flitter?  No, but I look back and I remember being awake a lot.  Oh, really?  Like, one night I just kept dreaming of Jack Reacher. 
[00:06:00]  That stupid Tom Cruise movie, which I hate.  Jack Reacher.  I just kept thinking about Jack Reacher all night.  I kept waking up thinking about Jack Reacher.  What's Jack Reacher?  What the hell?  I don't know why.  That's the new one.  That's the new Tom Cruise movie.  It looks terrible.  And I just kept thinking about Jack Reacher.  And I don't know why.  It's weird.  Like, when you remember being awake and having thoughts.  That's kind of what I've been doing.  Was it thoughts or dreams?  More thoughts and dreams.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Like, I have the strap goes around my head, and I have to Velcro it to the very top, like 
[00:06:30]  a little bonnet.  And it keeps my mouth shut.  Oh, dude.  You should use it here.  You were actively thinking about Jack Reacher?  Or dream thinking.  I don't know exactly.  But I remember having a lot of thoughts about Jack Reacher.  Because I hate the name of that movie so much.  His name is Jack Reacher.  You don't like it?  No.  It's awful.  What's it about?  I don't know.  Just a guy who does guy things. 
[00:07:00]  Guy with a gun who does guy with a gun cool things.  He's Jack Reacher.  Is this the new one?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  It appears to be Mission Impossible without gadgets.  Right.  Yeah, or Cabretti.  Cabretti.  It really does seem to be like Tom Cruise made a throwaway movie.  Yeah.  You know, like he's got the, Tom Cruise usually has the big premieres, the giant, like blockbuster  movies.  And then occasionally just makes these, oh, yeah, that's a lot of money.  Like he did with, who's that girl? 
[00:07:30]  Katherine Heigl.  They're going to do a movie with her.  Where they were, uh, am I wrong, Kenny?  And there's really nothing.  Did you see the commercial where he's confronted by five people?  Yes, I saw that.  And he goes, I'm going to beat the shit out of three.  Isn't the last two always run away?  And then that's what happens in the commercial.  That's funny.  Jack Reacher.  Yeah.  That scares you.  Oh, it's terrible dialogue.  That scares you.  Yeah, he's not good for this role.  He's got like a Cabretti car. 
[00:08:00]  Nothing to lose.  Is he a cop?  I don't know.  I'm a cop, you idiot.  He's Jack Reacher.  What's Jack Reacher?  I don't know.  If he is, he's rogue.  That's the nickname of a guy with long arms.  Yes.  There's the fights.  You wanted this.  Oh, you wanted this.  Why don't they all attack him at once?  Really?  Oh, boy.  He didn't run away.  He's shorter than everybody.  Of course he is.  He's probably standing on little shoeboxes beating them up. 
[00:08:30]  He's jumping up and down.  He hangs out at the supermarket and helps old ladies get things on high shelves.  That's his goal in life.  He's a Jack Reacher.  No, he works in a garage.  Because he's a Jack Reacher.  Terrible.  It's one of those movies, you know.  A little throwaway action movie with a horrible dialogue.  Yeah, but that's not good.  Cruise is a great actor, I think.  But I don't like that kind of cool guy dialogue for him.  That's...  It's just not... 
[00:09:00]  It doesn't suit him, no.  It doesn't suit him.  He wants to be an action star, though.  Like, that's where he wants...  This part of his career now, he's just action star.  Like the Bruce Willis type.  Yes.  The fucking Arnold Schwarzenegger.  Why do you think so?  He did all of Mission Impossibles.  He knows there's money in it.  It's easy.  Probably overseas does very well.  Yeah.  Do you think they're easy compared to really in-depth, like, Born on the Fourth of July roles?  Oh, man.  Imagine what you gotta do to get ready for a Born on the Fourth of July type role, or something  like that.  And this one, you just gotta work out, I guess. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah.  Get all buff.  And throw out horrible lines that are easy to remember.  You think he's, like, going and meeting the real Jack Reacher and doing research on what  it's like to be Jack Reacher?  You think he tells everyone to call him Jack Reacher on set?  Mr. Reacher.  Yeah, when you come to my trailer to get me, uh, say, Mr. Reacher.  Everybody's gotta call him J.R.  Yeah.  And then he comes out and says a fun line.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Take me to the set, huh?  Yeah, if you're not scared, you should be. 
[00:10:00]  Do you think they had to find short guys for him to beat up, or they had to do...  I wonder if they ever have to shoot him in a different height than other women.  Oh, yeah.  I bet it's all angles.  I bet.  Come on, scumbag, I'll kick your ass.  That's, like, his villains are progeria kids.  They had to hire Al Pacino to be the big bad guy boss.  Yeah.  It looks like they're just in a giant city.  Like a big, giant car tire next to them.  They're fighting.  It's a dollhouse. 
[00:10:30]  It's like a...  It's a bug's life.  They're fighting, and there's giant blades of grass around them.  Yes.  Yes, they're using various small things for weapons.  A matchstick.  All right, we've made them really small.  We get it.  We get it.  We've shrunk them.  Lilliputians.  Oh, I was watching fucking that Bourne legacy last night.  I just figured, ah, it's on demand.  I kind of enjoy the Bourne movies.  I've never seen one.  Ah, they're mindless fun, you know?  But now that's that new one, and they don't even have, you know, Jason Bourne in it. 
[00:11:00]  No?  It's that other guy from Hurt Locker.  Although he's done more movies than from Hurt Locker, but I just go the guy from Hurt Locker.  Jeremy Renner.  Jeremy Renner is in that.  I always call him Jeffrey Dahmer, because he played Jeffrey Dahmer in the TV movie.  Jeffrey Dahmer.  I always call him Jeremy Renner.  You do.  Jeremy Renner.  Yeah.  He's the, you know, the latest fucking Bourne guy, but he's not Bourne guy.  I love that, like, they did that, like, they wanted, they obviously wanted to make another  movie, and Matt Damon didn't want to do it. 
[00:11:30]  Right.  So they just changed the story, and the big tagline is now, like, you didn't think there  was just one, did you?  Yeah, yeah.  I was like, of course we did, yes.  Yeah.  And, like, they're taking drugs and stuff to enhance their capabilities, and then they  gotta kill all those, like, agents that are enhanced, and he's like, I don't know.  But when you tune into one of these Bourne movies, right from the beginning, you feel  like you got in the middle of the movie.  It's one of those movies where you're like, oh, I hope they explain all this stuff. 
[00:12:00]  Because they just start talking about things without any explanation of what's going on.  Was it good?  It wasn't bad for, you know, for one of those kind of movies.  But, you know, there should have been a little more action, though.  Gotta be honest with you.  They tried for a little too much storyline, not enough action.  I want to see some fucking death and destruction.  Because they had to rewrite the story to include somebody who wasn't Matt Damon.  They had to act like this was part of the story the whole time.  Yeah, yeah.  But they just made it up.  Ah, they just make it up. 
[00:12:30]  And so now you have to rewrite the whole saga.  You don't think that they knew Matt Damon wasn't gonna do this one?  Maybe not.  Well, they knew when it was time to make this one that he wasn't gonna do it.  But when they were making the original trilogy or whatever...  They never got into that storyline.  Right.  So now they have to invent a storyline so they can keep making movies.  They have his picture, his photograph on screen for a couple of times in a little dossier  thing.  It's like, oh, that's him.  Yeah, there he is.  Matt Damon.  It's a franchise still.  It counts.  Who wrote those?  I don't know.  There's a huge author that wrote those. 
[00:13:00]  Yeah?  Yeah, I see.  Like, is it Ludlum or Robert Ludlum?  Like, you see James Patterson's a guy you see...  Like, you know when you see hardcover in the airport, you know they're a big author.  Like, when the hardcovers make it to the airport...  Yeah, yeah.  Because they only have softcover there, usually.  Ooh.  And those little Hudson News things.  And James Patterson's one of those guys.  Robert Ludlum.  Oh, it is Ludlum.  Okay.  Ah, and they use that...  Whoever the director is does shaky cam.  It's like when they're sitting at a conference table, the camera's shaking, and then it zooms  in and comes back out.  It's just like, ah! 
[00:13:30]  Like the office.  Yeah, it was.  And it's kind of like, you know, ah!  Ah, it's even when they're just hanging out at the table, it's action-packed.  Yeah.  The camera's moving.  Look out!  He doesn't even write these anymore.  Really?  Yeah, now it's Robert Ludlum's The Bourne Legacy.  Oh!  A new novel by Eric Van Lustbader.  So they just use his name!  It's the same thing they did to Matt Damon.  Right!  He's written, like, this Eric Van whatever has written six Bourne things.  They have nothing to do with Robert Ludlum. 
[00:14:00]  How many has Ludlum written?  Ludlum.  Oh, Jason Bourne is the guy's name?  Yes.  I hate the name Jason on an action guy.  You don't like Jason Bourne?  But is that really, uh, I guess they're good books.  He wrote The Bourne Identity, Supremacy, and Ultimatum.  He only wrote three?  He wrote the first three.  And they fucking, they just, I guess he franchised it out.  Yeah, why not?  He created the character.  He's got other stuff to do.  Yeah.  Like Star Wars.  Like, anyone can write a Star Wars novel as long as it's, you know, approved by George Lucas.  Like WWE fan fiction.  Yeah.  That E-Rock likes to jot down and write. 
[00:14:30]  He's already got the Royal Rumble winner picked out.  Wow.  That's right.  Wait, does George Lucas actually read them?  I wonder if he does because he's making money off of them.  I think there's some sort of approval process.  You can't just write like a Star Wars novel and-  I'm writing one.  Oh.  Interesting.  I'd love to read it.  Now you're going to have to go through Disney.  Yeah, because it's about Chewbacca.  Yes.  It's called Chewy Gets Shoes.  Because he needs shoes because he can't get into any stores or restaurants.  It's a whole novel?  Yes.  Wow.  Will there be a chapter about a hat at any point?  Yes.  Chewy's hat is chapter seven.  Yeah, I've seen some Star Wars fan films where they actually make like films and people 
[00:15:00]  dressed as like- some of them are very extravagant, others not so much.  Is there anywhere there's like a girl holding like a fucking- a taser between Darth Vader  and an ugly unfuckable mope?  Oh, a blaster, right, yes. 
[00:15:30]  A fat chubby little- I saw him this morning fucking down the hallways.  Which one is this?  This is some Star Wars-  The Secret in the Sand.  Oh.  They use the iMovie fake fox thing.  Yes, the fake fox thing.  A gaz car-  Yes, gaz car.  Very similar introduction.  I'm sure they'll have a scroll.  Scroll, scroll on the screen.  A long time ago in a galaxy far far away. 
[00:16:00]  These guys are creaming thinking of this shit.  And-  Do you want me to fast forward to the action?  Well, let's see.  This is-  They just bite the whole beginning.  Star Wars.  And now, uh, here comes the guy's story.  Episode one.  The Secret in the Sand.  Whoa.  Sounds terrible.  Martha lost her wedding ring at the beach.  It is a time of war.  A time of rebellion.  The time of the Empire. 
[00:16:30]  With each new star system captured under the-  Shut up!  Under surrender or purely by sheer force, the Empire is growing in strength.  Great mystery surrounds Darth Vader's latest plans.  The Empire has entrusted their best pilot with a mission so secret, only the highest ranking Imperial officers have been informed.  On a desolate planet, on the outer rim, the pilot has received a secret data plan that should- could change the outcome of the Empire and finally crushed-  Oh, yuck. 
[00:17:00]  It's- what a hokey little storyline, okay?  A secret data plan, which means he can call in Canada for the same price.  You think that's a good opening?  Oh, it's terrible.  I can see these guys just jacking off these nerds in their basement, just jacking it to the scroll.  All right, how far are you going to let it go?  It has to go the whole way.  Now, there's going to be the bottom-  Now, I haven't seen this.  Bottom of a ship.  Yeah.  Very close view.  Pan down to a planet.  Dude, the guys who made this, like they look at- 
[00:17:30]  They watch it after they've made it, and they're looking like we finally did it, guys.  It's us.  All right, here comes...  Oh, that's awful.  Oh, God.  These effects aren't very special.  Oh, it's this very two-dimensional planet.  Oh, is that horrible?  Oh, now the actors come in.  I wonder how much they ought to save up for TIE Fighter helmets. 
[00:18:00]  This looks like the graphics from the game missed.  What's he saying?  Yes, this is terrible.  You can't understand what he's saying, because they used too much effect on his voice.  And he's, um...  We got a green screen, guys.  Look what we can do.  This is terrible.  Could you go forward to where they're...  What's he saying?  ...talking to each other?  Who's chili?  Oh, no.  Oh, is this that fucking, uh...  Blazing sounds.  It's like that blazing sounds.  All right, let's move on. 
[00:18:30]  Double time.  Do you think they location scouted?  Oh, my God.  Yes, they did.  We need a puddle.  Oh, they're in a...  See, it just looks like a pond.  It doesn't look like Tatooine at all.  No.  This doesn't look...  This is the sand planet or something.  It's very mysterious.  There's four stormtroopers.  He got three other nerds to do this with him.  Yes.  In full regalia.  Full Star Wars stormtrooper regalia.  And they're trying too hard to look like they're pointing their guns.  There's a little kid off set just chucking rocks at them and calling them nerds. 
[00:19:00]  I would...  If I was George Lucas, I would personally deliver a cease and desist to these people.  Just...  Hello?  Yeah, saw your fan film?  Oh, nice cut.  All right.  It's all, like, effect-y.  There's no...  And it's obviously royalty-free music.  It's not Star Wars.  Yeah.  It's not John Williams music.  I'm ready to move out.  Double time.  He said double time before.  He said it before double time.  Oh, this is terrible. 
[00:19:30]  It's a forest right by my house.  We can fill it.  He's got the same guys playing both roles.  Dude.  You gotta...  Tell your mom you gotta hang out longer.  We need an extra stormtrooper.  You think somebody didn't want to do it because they were going to get their stormtrooper outfit dirty?  Yeah.  Guys, we got sick stormtrooper outfits.  We're going to have to get creative with shots.  Dude, I got the con this weekend.  I can't get my suit dirty.  What's that red thing on his shoulder?  I don't know.  Hopefully a fucking...  I couldn't think of anything good to say.  It's a tumor. 
[00:20:00]  Maybe he's the leader.  Thank you.  Hopefully a tumor.  Oh, is he team leader?  How about double time?  He's kneeling in the...  What's he feeling like grass for?  Oh, this is awful.  Look at how difficult it is for him to kneel.  Oh, his suit.  His stormtrooper suit is making it difficult for him to kneel down.  They're all just excited to wear the cod pieces.  But he touched the ground and did the thing that you do with blood.  Like you're sifting through it with your fingers.  Yeah, yeah.  You run it through your fingers.  Oh.  Oh, my God.  These blaster effects are terrible. 
[00:20:30]  Oh, no.  All right, guys.  It's the big battle scene.  And they're using the same five guys for both...  Look at the flames.  The flames are terrible.  Oh, boy.  Oh, my God.  This is awful.  How cheesy.  It's just...  The little fire.  I can't even...  They're shooting at...  The five guys they're shooting at are obviously the guys in the uniforms.  Yeah, they're never in the same scene at the same time.  So they had to shoot it all as the stormtroopers and then shoot it as the rebels. 
[00:21:00]  Why would you do this?  Why is he wearing a World War II helmet?  Oh, good death scene, dude.  Yeah.  You nailed it.  How much left is this?  Holy screen.  Double time.  12 minutes.  Oh, that stinks.  Where's the secret of the sand, though?  Yeah, the secret of the sand.  What happened?  They're on grass now.  They have some in their shoes and they track it in the house.  Mom yells at them.  Oh, man.  They should do the secret of girls.  And they all look at a vagina and try to identify it.  Figure out what it is. 
[00:21:30]  It's that fucking monster that swallowed Jabba the Hutt.  What?  This is so bad.  All right, enough of this.  I've had it.  I can't go out today.  I'm mastering the sound.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:22:00]  It's another battle scene.  This is terrible.  All right, enough of this.  It's an action film.  I don't know how we even got into talking about Star Wars fan films.  We were talking about franchising, and I didn't realize that nerds actually did this.  Yeah, yeah.  And this works?  That's really a typical one.  That's not very badly done.  It's actually their costumes are very good.  Are the ones with bad costumes?  Oh, my God.  Yeah, yeah.  The other ones have got some ones that they just made themselves with hats. 
[00:22:30]  Various hats around the house and galoshes.  I want to see that.  I want to see some of the regular...  Just a regular guy with a Star Wars hat.  With a Star Wars hat and galoshes.  That's awful.  Jedi uniforms out of sheets.  Yes.  Terrible.  I don't understand the attraction to any film like that or any franchise.  You don't like the Star Wars?  It's fine, but enough already.  I think Star Wars got way over-fucking-rated for some reason, because the first one was  so huge, and then Empire was kind of okay. 
[00:23:00]  It was good, I guess.  Yeah.  But then that's it.  That Ewok shit, over.  It was over.  Don't even try to preach a fucking Return of the Jedi to me.  That one part of the movie kills the whole thing.  It's terrible.  I mean, it's an obvious attempt at merchandising.  Yes!  Yes!  Which is a shame, but it's not like Star Wars was a franchise with a lot of integrity to 
[00:23:30]  begin with.  No, it's a lot of...  No, that's just it.  I don't know why people kind of have this impression that it's an amazing fucking trilogy,  and then another trilogy.  Yeah, the new ones they made, all of them stink.  Horrible.  I think they stink.  Did you go see them in theaters?  Yes, I did.  I remember, that was like one of the last times you actually had to wait in a line to  buy...  Because you couldn't buy tickets online yet.  No.  Yeah, I waited online to buy tickets.  Yeah, I waited online for a stupid midnight screening.  But it was fun when Star Wars comes on the screen. 
[00:24:00]  And everybody goes, yeah!  I saw the first three in theaters.  No desire to see these at all.  What about the next three?  Yes, I know.  Well, Lucas annoys me.  He just bugs me.  Well, I don't even think he's got anything to do with it at this point.  You know what?  They might be good then.  They might actually make him good.  I would love to see the ones that he has nothing to do with.  Because whoever cast the Darth Vader, that good-looking guy, Christian...  How do you hate...  Hayden...  Hayden...  Hayden...  Hayden...  Hayden...  Hayden...  Hayden Panetari... 
[00:24:30]  Hayden Panetari would have been more manly in that role.  Terrible.  A whiny little bitch.  Has to be a good-looking guy.  Instead of just a fucking...  Yeah, it's Darth Vader.  He doesn't have to be fucking good-looking.  And what a whiny Darth Vader.  Terrible.  Like, uh...  He did my mother!  So I killed him!  I killed him all!  I can't even watch it!  I was one of those that left episode one trying to make excuses for it.  Like, well, I mean, it wasn't bad.  You wanted it to be so good.  Yeah, it sets it up. 
[00:25:00]  It sets it up for the subsequent ones.  You know, Jar Jar was.  I mean, he had his funny moments, and he had...  Who's the guy that did the amazingly funny reviews?  He talks like this.  Oh, yes.  Yes.  Ah!  I asked, because I was watching him do Titanic recently, like, the other night.  He has a new...  It's a two-part Titanic one out.  Oh, I gotta see that one.  And, uh, just starts talking like that.  That's how he talks.  Why is he walking so far to go to the...  Like, he calls out every little aspect of the movie? 
[00:25:30]  Yeah, I didn't watch the Titanic.  I watched, like, 20 minutes of the new Titanic.  It's fucking hilarious.  Oh, I gotta see that one.  I fucking...  I've watched all of his reviews.  Yeah, it's something with red in it.  Mr.  What the fuck's his name?  It's Mr. Something.  Somebody sent it to me on Twitter.  He's very funny.  I don't know how he gets rights to the footage to show these clips.  How do you put these clips online and not get in trouble?  Yes.  I don't know.  I guess, uh...  It's very hard to get all those summonses and subpoenas out. 
[00:26:00]  To just make people cease and desist.  Are you allowed to do that, though?  Red Letter Media.  Red Letter Media.  Red Letter Media.  That's it.  The guy's hilarious.  Yeah, I don't know if you're allowed to do that.  Because, like, music and stuff, YouTube will just take it down.  Yeah.  This is his own site.  Oh, he doesn't do it on YouTube?  No, I don't think so.  Oh, well, then that's why.  But even a clip show like that, like, if you're just playing clips, YouTube will take it down?  It's kind of weird.  Probably.  I know if you put music on one of your videos, like, YouTube kind of knows. 
[00:26:30]  They just know.  Yeah.  Yeah, within five minutes.  My wife uploaded, like, my daughter's ballet recital video.  Yeah.  And it got taken down because the song that's played while she's dancing is copyrighted.  Well, it has to be some kind of a technology.  It's a program, yeah.  What's the technology like?  Like Shazam.  Shazam, right.  Yep.  Yeah, it's, uh, the actual YouTube itself knows the music's there. 
[00:27:00]  Right.  But, like, if you're just hosting it yourself, then you actually can wait until, like you  said, Ant, they're sending cease and desist and stuff like that so you can get away with  putting it up for a while.  And they actually know, uh, they can identify video, too.  So if you put up, like, Major League Baseball or something or a TV show, they know just from  the video.  So that's why a lot of times people reverse it.  Yeah.  So you'll see it in backwards because it doesn't pick it up, I guess.  They do that with wrestling. 
[00:27:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Why?  All the logos are backwards and everything.  They just reverse it.  They just reverse the video so the program can pick up that that's a copywritten program  because it knows what the video looks like.  Oh, they reverse it?  Yeah.  So they just reverse it.  Who thought to do that?  I don't know.  Hackers.  That's pretty smart.  First, they tried putting it upside down, but people were angry.  Yeah.  Like, this is really stupid.  Oh, so the programs on YouTube will recognize the logos?  Yeah.  Isn't that fucked up?  Wow, that's amazing technology.  Technology! 
[00:28:00]  Yeah, I dig it.  Yeah.  So I don't know how this guy gets away with doing these really funny reviews.  Yeah, they're hilarious, though.  I've seen that guy.  I got to see the Titanic one.  A lot of loose ends that he picks up on.  I didn't get that far into it.  Maybe I got 15 minutes into it.  I was just setting it up.  I could sit there and watch the whole goddamn thing.  It's a two-parter end.  It was late.  Oh!  I had to put on my chin strap and get some sleep.  Yes.  Get some snoozy time with your chin strap.  I had to put on my chin strap and wake up every fucking 35 seconds.  Fucking zilch. 
[00:28:30]  Fucking body's betraying me.  That's got to suck.  More than you can imagine.  Oh, my God.  I was having some dreamy dream that...  It's the oddest dream.  And I've had this recurring dream for a while, too.  Where I...  My old sheet metal worker boss...  My boss from Apollo air conditioning is firing me.  And, like, he's asking me to hand in my keys to the truck.  And, uh...  And I'm really, like, fucking freaking out about it. 
[00:29:00]  And then, even in the back of my head, I'm like, wait a minute.  I do radio.  Do you wake up in the morning trying to figure out whether or not you still work there?  Or do you know?  No, no.  I kind of know I don't work there.  Because, like, I have those dreams like that where I think, like, I...  My college...  I'm in college.  Yeah.  Like, papers aren't done or something and the semester's over.  And it takes me, like, three minutes when I wake up to figure out and assure myself...  That it's okay.  That I'm not there anymore.  Really?  Yeah. 
[00:29:30]  Yeah.  Like, I would think I was still working in air conditioning.  When I first woke up, like...  You should be.  Am I still working there, you know?  Yeah, those dreams are...  They're very strange.  And I still have dreams about school.  You do?  Yeah, they never go away.  You don't have the stressful radio dream, so...  No, I used to have those when we played music.  I would have that dream that, you know, the song's running out and you can't get to the CD in time. 
[00:30:00]  Very frightening.  But I've had those dreams where I'm back in school for some reason trying to get my diploma.  Are you you?  Yeah, I'm me at this age.  And I'm fucking it up.  I'm not going to class.  I'm not...  And then I just finally go...  I finally give up and go, why am I even doing this?  I have a job in radio.  Like, it comes to me like, why am I doing this? 
[00:30:30]  I got a radio gig.  Why am I at work at Apollo Air Conditioning and upset that I'm fucking not on the job site and I'm going to get fired?  What do you think that means, Jimmy?  You analyze my dreams a lot.  Either, um...  I'm trying to think.  Something to do with the fact that you're afraid of getting fired from here, even though you know it's...  Really?  Yeah, I would think so.  Sure.  Why am I doing this?  Or maybe the job, maybe the radio job in college relates to other things in your life.  It wasn't college.  It was high school.  Oh, high school.  I was actually trying to graduate from high school in my dreams. 
[00:31:00]  Just you cutting class at your age and smoking pot with a 16-year-old.  Calling the teacher teach.  Yes!  The teacher!  The teacher's calling you daddy-o?  Hey, teach!  Yeah.  Oh, I don't know.  Yeah, it was really...  It's really strange.  I heard you talking about dreams like that where you wake up and you still think you're supposed to be in school.  Always.  Every time.  It always happens on the weekends, too.  At another job.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know why. 
[00:31:30]  Like, stress seems to manifest itself, at least in my dreams, like, the thing you were stressed about before.  Yeah.  Like, not what you're actually stressed about today.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Like, it's never the job you have now.  It's what you used to be stressed about.  Ah, they don't make no sense, those dreams.  Mm-mm.  Craziness.  My catchphrase.  I know.  You never have a dream that you just run out of stuff to talk about?  No.  That you're just sitting here and you go, I got nothing.  Oh, imagine that.  I'd just be like, where?  Well, that would suck. 
[00:32:00]  Yeah, you just had nothing to say.  What's up?  But you can't have dead air, so you...  You try to get the callers to call in on the topic of what's up?  Um, yeah, we're having a discussion today.  What's up? 
[00:32:30]  What's the weather like where you are?  Oh, no.  They're not calling.  No one's calling.  Oh, God.  I was watching that fucking show.  What's that show that they put radio on TV?  Oh, Dish Nation.  Dish Nation.  Last night, I'm trolling through the channels and I see Dish Nation.  I'm like, I gotta.  So I put it on.  Scott and Todd are like their stars.  Yeah.  They go to a bunch of different radio shows, but Scott and Todd, they feature them pretty  prominently.  Well, it's because Todd has so many of those just snappy one-liners and voices. 
[00:33:00]  Does he do voices?  It's amazing.  It's always the same voice, though.  He always kind of rag, rag.  Like, he just does this weird, like, pseudo-New York, obviously put-on voice.  To see Scott Shannon, though, actually see him as he's saying those things.  He's another one that's talking over his dentures.  Yeah.  He's like, he does his voice like this, but he's also trying to talk over these big dentures. 
[00:33:30]  Oh, it's impossible to watch.  Do we have some?  Yeah.  It's hard to talk over dentures.  Why didn't they fucking fix that?  What the fuck is that about?  You ruined Star Trek for me.  Yeah.  I knew there was something wrong with the way Spock talked, but when you said he was talking  over his dentures, I'm like, there goes that movie.  I shall be, I have been, and shall always be your friend.  You are the captain of the Enterprise. 
[00:34:00]  How humiliating.  Live long in Prussia.  Oh, it's terrible.  He's worried they're going to fall out?  Yes.  Why would a Vulcan have false teeth?  And how come the Vulcans, who, like, if you watch Star Trek, you know the Vulcans live  a lot longer than humans?  Like, they don't age as quickly as humans?  But he looks older than all of them.  What the fuck?  Yeah, he really, well, how long was he supposed to be waiting?  Oh, 25 years?  Yeah, I guess so.  They went through what?  The fucking, the zip hole?  The zip hole.  Whatever it was called.  It's in the bathroom. 
[00:34:30]  The zip hole.  He dropped his fucking, what, he dropped his strudel and he went to pick it up and it  fell into the zip hole.  His dumb old man teeth.  Fucking nose.  Where's Scott Shannon?  Oh, Jesus.  Here it is.  Sure, sure, sure, sure.  I love this.  I am not our father.  Oh, wait a minute.  Oh, this is not logical.  Your dentures are not logical. 
[00:35:00]  There are so few Vulcans left, we cannot afford to ignore each other.  Then why did you send Kirk aboard when you alone could have explained the truth?  Because you needed each other.  Because you...  ...of all that you could accomplish together.  ...of a friendship that will define you both.  In ways you cannot yet realize.  How did you persuade him to keep your secret?  He inferred that universe-ending paradoxes would ensue should he break his promise. 
[00:35:30]  You lied.  Promise.  I...  I implied.  A gamble?  An act of faith.  One I hope that you will repeat in the future at Starfleet.  I'm going to go to a better fucking denture doctor.  I'm going to start to be commissioned and help rebuild our race.  And yet you can be in two places at once.  It's tough.  Could you tell me where you went for your dentures so I could go back in time and kill the guy?  Don't go see Dr. Zell for your fake teeth this time. 
[00:36:00]  That's terrible.  In this case, do yourself a favor.  Sure.  Brush after every meal.  And don't forget to floss.  Floss regularly.  There's so much lens flare in this scene.  It's in every scene.  Farewell would appear oddly self-serving.  I shall simply say...  Simply say...  Good luck.  She sells seashells by the sea shore.  I am Spock Rokal.  Why does he use lens flare?  He...  It's just his thing.  Looks action-packed. 
[00:36:30]  It does?  I guess.  Makes the room look alive?  Every fucking scene, that lens flare...  I guess they cut down in the new one.  I am psyched for the new one.  I'm a fucking Star Trek asshole with those fucking movies.  I'm looking forward to the new one, too.  I think the first one was great.  It was really good.  Action.  Although the version I saw was shot by some fucking guy in Chinatown, and we saw their fucking ankles and feet in Anthony's theater.  Did you realize how bad that copy was?  I'm like, what the fuck's happening?  Half the movie's gone.  I didn't realize how bad the copy was. 
[00:37:00]  I'm like, what are we doing?  The top and bottom of the movie were completely cut off.  So you're missing the top of people's heads, and not even just the top of their heads.  Like, up to their eyes.  It was enraging, and fucking ants like, oh, it's alright.  Yeah, a little bit chopped off.  And it was choppy.  Like, it was really choppy and digitized.  It was a really...  But you know what?  It was, I think, the day it came out.  Now, do you have it on Blu-ray yet?  No, I don't get anything anymore.  I don't get any Blu-ray anything. 
[00:37:30]  I just get shit on demand all the time.  Fuck it.  I'm not one of these people that are like, look how crisp and clear it is.  I mean, it's good enough when you're watching it on TV.  I don't care about Blu-ray.  I'm doing a little redesigning in my apartment.  Oh!  Yeah.  My TV is like, I have a really good...  It's a plasma, which I know that they don't do them anymore, really.  But it's a black outline.  It's Pioneer Elite.  It's the best fucking...  One of the best pieces of technology I ever own.  It's amazing, the picture.  What's that?  You should get a new TV.  But the picture still looks good.  But eventually, those things are going to burn. 
[00:38:00]  Are they?  Yeah.  That's why they don't make plasma TVs anymore.  Burn, baby.  They really don't make them anymore?  No.  I probably had that for...  It's either LED or LCD.  You should get an LED.  I've had that for...  You should get what Anthony has in his living room.  Over six years, I've had that for.  But eventually, those pixels are going to burn, and you're just going to need to go buy  a new TV anyway.  That's why they don't make plasmas anymore.  But I feel like if you throw out a TV that's still good...  So sell it.  I'm only asking this...  Or give it to someone.  Put it in your bedroom.  It's a good set, dude. 
[00:38:30]  Put it up on the wall.  I paid a lot for that when it came out.  Did you?  Yes!  Isn't that terrible?  It's sad to think about how much you paid for televisions.  I bought my LCD six years ago, probably for $1,600, and now you can get that TV for  like $900.  So the first few flat screens that were coming out, you were paying $10,000 for a $10,000.  Yeah, I can't relate to any of that.  Should I get another one?  Should I give it to somebody and get another one?  Maybe I should.  Because it's too big. 
[00:39:00]  I feel like it's wrecking my apartment.  You might as well now.  I mean, you're redesigning your apartment.  What better time to do it?  There's a new big, badass Sony out on the market.  How big?  Oh, it's like $80.  That's too big!  What?  I have a $50.  It's too big.  I want an $80.  I want $80.  Roland's got one of those 3D smart TVs.  Maybe I should get the 3D smart TV.  Is it good?  Those are really going places.  Is it good?  Yeah, you're hearing all about those 3D.  No, you're not.  Can you talk to it?  Yes.  Roland loves sitting in his living room and talking to his television.  Hello, TV.  Show me four commercials. 
[00:39:30]  TV's like, what?  What are you talking about?  Oh, my God.  How does a TV understand them?  Just gay porn on all the time.  But they might not have better pictures than I have.  Oh.  You think they have ones with better pictures now?  Than the one you bought six years ago?  But it's a good fucking plasma.  Oh, Jimmy, you're so behind the time.  No, I'm not, Anthony.  The LED TVs that are out now, you probably don't even know how much better they are.  Yes.  LED is ridiculous.  I still have the one from K-Rock, but it's in my bedroom. 
[00:40:00]  I don't want to get rid of it because it was a free set.  I feel like I'm throwing it.  I'm like salmon that way.  It was a gift.  It's in my bedroom.  That's one in my Manhattan apartment is the one from K-Rock.  Oh, you still use that, right?  K-Rock, yeah.  But it's not as good.  No, it's terrible.  Is it terrible?  Now it's completely terrible.  Do they have them thinner now?  Oh, yeah.  Oh.  That thing's heavy.  They're like a quarter inch thin now.  Now they're so fucking...  Yeah, it is.  They're like this.  They're like the back of the monitor here on my laptop.  They're so light. 
[00:40:30]  You can pick them up yourself and just hang them on the fucking wall.  Just like they said the future would be.  Remember when they said, someday you're going to be able to hang your TV on the wall like  a picture?  Mm-hmm.  And now you can do that.  It is weird.  I remember hearing that and you forget like every bar now has flat screens.  Remember the idea of flat screen was so foreign?  And then it just, all of a sudden, the old technology was gone.  It was impossible to think of because you just knew the technology of the cathode ray  tube thing that had to be fucking two feet long and inside your television, which made 
[00:41:00]  the big back on it.  It would, whenever you moved, you'd pull the TV away from the wall and there'd be that,  like someone was barbecuing behind your television.  The little fucking dust and heat thing on the wall it would leave.  And you never, you're like, oh, how are they going to hang a fucking TV on the wall with  all this shit behind it?  But then they figured out, uh, maybe I should give it away.  I wonder if I should put my fucking, the really good one in my room and then give away  the K-Rock one.  Yes.  Give it away?  Give it away.  Should I sell it?  I don't want to sell.  It's not worth selling. 
[00:41:30]  No, no one will buy it.  Then just put it in.  It's so cheap to buy a TV now.  I want to sell it though.  It's like, fuck it.  How long ago was that?  2008?  How much?  2,500.  I imagine doing that.  You wouldn't get a dime for it.  I don't know.  Nobody probably wants it.  It's probably too big and clunky.  In this day and age, you'd just buy a TV.  They're so inexpensive now.  It didn't even occur to me to do that.  Oh my God.  I'm looking because I have it.  When you walk into my apartment, in the corner, I have a TV, a big black screen on a big stand 
[00:42:00]  that you can turn into the other room.  It just is an ice.  It takes up too much room.  I need a little area or I need to mount it on the wall quietly with a little swivel.  My apartment's designed weird.  There's no place.  My living room and dining room area is very large, but there's nowhere convenient to  mount a TV because you have windows.  Really?  Yeah, man.  And if I mount it on the one wall, then I put the couch somewhere, then I'm too close  to the TV. 
[00:42:30]  Oh, that's bad for your feng shui.  No, but I don't want to be too close to the TV.  Yeah.  So I have to put it somewhere.  I don't know what a good size TV is.  I don't want an 80.  80!  That's too big for me.  Oh, 80.  Well, you think 50 is too big?  For my apartment, it seems like it because...  I just get 42.  Why don't you just fucking tack an iPhone up to your wall?  That's too small.  But I don't watch TV that much anymore.  I'm caught up on Homeland again.  Yeah, I'm caught up.  The last episode wasn't unrealistic enough, so I wanted to go further into the fucking  soap opera writing. 
[00:43:00]  Is it really bad?  The acting is good, although Claire Dane's eyes are starting to annoy me.  What's wrong with them?  They're just bugging...  Are they googly?  She's fucking googly-eyed.  Does she have googly eyes?  Total googly eyes.  The daughter on it, I fucking hate now.  Yeah.  I hate Damien Lewis's character.  I want him to get killed.  I hate him.  Is he evil?  Yeah, he's one of the stars.  Here's my theory.  I don't think I'm giving anything away, because you know Damien Lewis is in season two.  I think that they wanted to get rid of him early, and couldn't because he won the Emmy. 
[00:43:30]  That's my theory.  You think they would write off him?  He's like the big star, too.  I don't know what she is, though.  Is she?  Yeah.  And I don't really know what the premise of the show is beyond season one.  Like, you kind of wrapped up the whole...  You know what I mean?  Like, it's pretty obvious that in season two now, it's very much...  I still like the show a lot.  It's a stretch, though.  But it's in comic book mode now.  Like, it feels like a comic book movie.  Yeah.  That's showtime, right?  Well, yeah.  And they also...  But they're not...  They don't... 
[00:44:00]  They seem to take real issues and caricature them in a weird way.  Yeah.  But their argument would be...  Ripped from the headlines?  Are they ripped from the headlines, as they say?  Oh.  Subject matter torn from the headlines.  Like, in law and order.  I hate those.  When it's like, hey, wait, I've heard this story before.  Kind of.  Oh, right.  That was that news thing.  I think it's less to do with showtime and more to do with a really good idea for a one-season show.  Exactly.  And then it's really hard to keep that going and going and going.  Because after a while, it's like, okay, he has to be caught by now. 
[00:44:30]  You know?  Like, this story has to be over.  But since it's so successful, you can't just end it.  Have the Soprano...  I mean, maybe you need more...  There's enough good characters.  Sopranos killed...  If you haven't seen the Sopranos, and you're in season one, you have five seconds.  Four.  Three.  Two.  They killed Big Pussy.  See, I lied.  But, like, Sopranos wasn't so narrow.  Like, Homeland is a very narrow scope.  The show is about a guy... 
[00:45:00]  Guy who comes back.  Right, who comes back from war and is a terrorist.  And then once you find out, like, halfway through season one, so it's not a spoiler anymore.  Like, once he is found out, like, okay, you're kind of finished.  Yeah, the Sopranos, there's a bunch of different crime storylines, his personal life storyline.  You could kill off a main character, but there's so many other...  It's a real big ensemble cast.  The Sopranos is just Tony's, like, it's the mafia meets his family life, so it's his whole life. 
[00:45:30]  Right.  See, I love her in it.  I think...  Damien Lewis annoys me, even though I know he's a good actor, he annoys me.  I heard SNL parried him because of his tiny mouth.  Really?  Which is funny.  I think he's good, but I think the guy who plays...  You know, he's British.  Is he really?  That's amazing to me.  That shows you...  Very, very British accent.  It's not surprising.  It's so weird to see...  Like when Andrew Lincoln came in for Walking Dead.  Yeah, it's like, stop it.  What are you doing?  Wait a minute, you're not English.  What are you doing?  Stop with that accent. 
[00:46:00]  He's really good.  Who else is good?  The guy that plays...  Mandy Patinkin?  Saul.  Saul is great.  And who's the black guy that plays the head of the agency?  He's also excellent.  Oh, yeah, yeah, he's good.  Mandy Patinkin.  Is that the guy's name or a girl?  No, that's Saul's name, Mandy Patinkin.  Mandy Patinkin.  Oh, okay.  He was in Yentl.  Is he British, too?  He's in today.  He's in today?  He's where?  In the building.  Saul?  Yeah.  Dude!  This afternoon.  Oh, Jimmy.  Look at Jimmy.  Jimmy just like, wah!  I didn't know.  I like him. 
[00:46:30]  Yeah?  Gonna get a picture?  What time is he here?  I think one-ish.  No, before that.  Oh, man, I would love to meet him.  I think he's doing Ron and Fez.  Yeah, Ron and Fez are on a one.  He's great.  Oh!  Doing Ron and Fez.  Yeah, I mean, all the actors are good on that show.  It's a fun show to watch, but it's, like, it's not, like, a realistic show anymore.  No, but it stinks, and it really annoys me that they've cartooned it so much. 
[00:47:00]  Because, again, the acting is still good.  The guy he's talking about is great.  Saul's great.  Yeah.  And there's other storylines.  I would rather just see it be a good show about homeland terrorism pursuit.  Like, yeah, you'd have to, you'd have to start, like, you'd have to eliminate the Damien  Lewis character, and then season two.  Oh, they're going to kill him.  I fucking hate him.  Season two, it's a whole nother case.  I hate him.  Really?  Hate him.  I hate his fucking character.  I want him shot.  Yeah?  But there's also, like, there's no way Claire Danes would still be working for the CIA.  No, of course not.  But she could still be somehow. 
[00:47:30]  I can, like, you have to suspend disbelief for television.  I can understand when they put, I said suspend belief.  What, are we watching him talk?  Yeah, I'm just listening to him talk.  Here's Damien Lewis.  I've never heard him actually.  This is the Jonathan Ross show.  Your performance in it, which is central to the whole success, and quite a thing to carry,  I would have thought, that whole show.  But you've been praised and lauded for it quite rightly.  Just won the Emmy for it as well.  Yes, I did.  Very nice of you to bring that up.  So early, yeah.  What's happening?  Isn't that weird? 
[00:48:00]  Very nice.  My children actually thought I was nominated for an Emma.  So I, the Americans didn't like it.  It doesn't make any sense.  Why are you talking like that?  Stop faking.  He is so good at eliminating that English accent.  He was in, he was the lead in Band of Brothers, and just fantastic.  He was so good in that.  He's a great host.  He gets a lot of people.  Jonathan Ross and fucking Graham Norton, get everybody. 
[00:48:30]  Graham.  Graham.  What an English name that is.  Yeah, he's a little, I think a gay man.  Is he?  He appears to be.  Is he a slight gay man?  But they have the, those are great shows, man.  They do get every fucking Hollywood actor goes on those.  Yeah.  They pay to fly him over and pay for them to be on the show, too.  Oh, I didn't know that.  Yeah.  Really?  I didn't, they pay them to be on the show?  Yep.  You get booked like a job, and they cover all your expenses, your travel, and they pay  you to be on the show.  But wait a minute.  That doesn't make sense to me, because the movie studios would fucking easily pick up 
[00:49:00]  travel to have De Niro on a show.  Because a lot of, some of these movies, when they know that it's not going to be overly  huge internationally, they'll book through, like what Roland does, through talent booking  and stuff like that.  How does he know this?  And they'll book them to get over there to the BBC.  How does he know this?  I don't know.  And the answer he just gave didn't address Jim's question whatsoever.  My question is this.  Like, if you're going to have Dustin Hoffman on one of these shows.  Ooh, when?  The movie, well, that's a big secret.  Oh.  The movie studio would gladly pay that. 
[00:49:30]  Whatever Jonathan Ross' show is going to pay, the studio can afford.  So they would pay to do it.  Not according to Eric.  Uh-huh.  Talk to Roland when he comes in.  He can explain a little bit.  In private.  Roland can explain something better?  Yeah, what?  That doesn't make sense to me for that reason, because the level, like Will Smith.  He was paid to come on the show.  Maybe they paid, but how much could they pay Will Smith to make it work, and he makes  20 million a film?  Like, what are they going to pay him, 50,000?  Which I guess is nice.  That's a lot of fucking money, though, to be on a show. 
[00:50:00]  It is, but why wouldn't the studio pay that for you to promote?  That's in your contract.  Right.  And where does that money come from?  Geez, 50 large for one guest?  It's crazy.  Those shows aren't, well, like, Graham Norton goes in season, so he'll do maybe 12 to 20 episodes,  and then he's off for, like, four or five months and comes back.  Oh, I didn't know that.  He's not a nightly show?  He's a weekly show.  Graham Norton's a weekly show?  Yeah.  Oh.  Oh, I did not know that.  Okay.  How does C-Rex know all this?  Eric Nagel of the Hollywood Nagels.  What's that?  Eric loves British TV. 
[00:50:30]  Oh, that's right.  Okay, so Graham is a weekly show.  That's a different...  And he's seasonal, too, so he's not on for the entire year.  I had no idea.  How great of a host is he?  He's very good.  He's fucking...  I've talked about him before.  The set is very colorful.  Yeah.  And he has the guests on.  You know how we do in here, kind of?  He does the same thing, just with bigger guests and better.  But it's the one he'll have.  Like, I saw one with Ozzy and Sharon and Gervais.  Right, right.  And while Ozzy is talking or Sharon is talking, then Gervais is just sitting there through the interview. 
[00:51:00]  That's great.  Like, that's the old Johnny Carson way of doing things when, you know, they just move over on the couch  and still kind of have some interaction with the guest that's still in the chair.  Like, that was always a cool thing back in the day.  I thought that was a nightly show, though.  I didn't realize that.  Really?  Is he the...  Let me see.  That's Graham, yeah.  Homosexual?  Look how colorful his studio is, though.  It really is.  Those English, though, have been like that for years.  They love a lot of colors.  They love splashing color on things. 
[00:51:30]  But look at the beautiful purples.  It looks like a fun...  Like, Graham Norton, whoever does his...  The opening for his show, it just looks like a really fun place to hang out.  Ooh.  And the set is great.  Like, this is the type of show.  Look at that.  It's fucking amazing.  And all the guests are out at the same time.  Yes.  Yeah, that is pretty cool.  It's a huge fucking studio.  You can fast forward to when he has guests.  I want to see who he's got.  I don't care what's my one.  Oh, those English people.  Oh, that's the one with Gervais.  Yeah, I just want to see what it looks like when they're all sitting there together. 
[00:52:00]  Yeah.  Does he bring...  He brings them all out?  Is that...  Yeah.  It looks like someone's, like, bad living room furniture.  Yeah, it does.  But look at how much fun that looks like to be there.  Yes.  That's right.  Gervais is there.  Ozzy, Sharon.  It looks like it's pretty similar to the Bravo show.  Really?  What?  Watch What Happens Live.  Watch What Happens Live, yeah.  Really?  Did you watch that?  I have.  It's like that show on Logo.  Let's see.  That's the gay channel. 
[00:52:30]  You can turn it off.  I just wanted to see...  That is pretty cool, yeah.  Yeah, and they're all talking, and it's comfortable.  None of them feel left out, which makes him a really good host.  That's what Watch What Happens Live is like.  Is it?  Okay.  Who hosts that?  The guy who's in charge of Bravo.  That guy...  Andy Cohen.  Andy Cohen, yeah.  Is it good?  Andy Cohen?  Sam's watched it a lot.  He loves it.  Apparently has.  Oh, boy.  Jay Moore does it.  Fuck the Peter Pumple.  You shut the fuck up.  Sorry, Sammy.  It's cool.  But I want to do it.  What were we talking about to get on the British TV? 
[00:53:00]  Yeah, Homeland.  We started this...  Yeah, we started with Scott and Todd, and then...  It was Homeland, yeah.  And then the English accent.  That's kind of the way it should be, all over the place.  Yeah, the English accent that Damien Lewis is so good at.  Whereas Walking Dead...  Well, he's English.  Yes.  He's so good at doing that English accent.  What an asshole.  I think Walking Dead is getting...  Season 2 is good, but Season 3 is really good.  I like it a lot.  It's fantastic.  Because the zombies are interesting, but I like where the storyline is coming. 
[00:53:30]  Yeah, this whole...  You could only go so far in a show with zombies of killing zombies, you know?  Now you need that whole people against people thing.  People...  Yeah, you need...  Well, that's why the tagline was, fight the dead, fear the living.  Jesus.  I hate a tagline.  Me too.  You don't like a tagline?  I hate a tagline.  Yuck.  Yeah.  Just show this shit already.  For the Jim Norton show, which I'm writing, it's an action-adventure. 
[00:54:00]  Oh.  I have a tagline.  You got a tagline?  Yeah.  For the Jim Norton show, action-adventure.  Yeah.  What is it?  It's not all Melba.  Dot, dot, dot.  I don't know what it means.  That's terrible.  That's a bad one.  It's not all Melba.  That is an awful one.  Do you have a tagline for your advice show?  Oh, you should have a tagline for your advice show.  I need a tagline.  Um, take my advice.  Not. 
[00:54:30]  That's a good one.  It's better than the shit that would have been in this slot.  What's that one?  A direct shot at me.  Ah.  Ah.  Was it?  I didn't even notice.  I start tomorrow.  Are you nervous?  At 10 a.m.  No, I'm not.  First day on the top.  You probably shouldn't be.  You do radio a lot.  I know.  I'm just kind of sitting in the same chair.  Yeah.  Open it.  We'll leave, and you'll sit there.  I'll be listening on the way home.  Exactly.  It'll be fun.  Travis will pop in.  It'll be the same dummies I see fucking five hours a day anyway. 
[00:55:00]  My first day at school.  Where are you going?  Right here.  It's like going to school at home.  It's like all of a sudden, my first day of college.  Where are you?  My mom's teaching me.  My fucking dad's the assistant principal at the college.  What?  You're going to take calls and stuff?  Yeah, but I've actually been printing out emails, and I've actually been writing for this one.  I said actually twice.  Why would you prep more for your advice show than you do for this show?  A lot more.  Well, this show, the kind of, you know.  But look where this show goes.  How would you prep for this show?  That's why I don't do prep for this show, because I love the way this show goes. 
[00:55:30]  I like it, too.  Just, you know, whatever's in the news, whatever we're talking about, whatever happened the night  before, shit like that.  I prep for interviews.  Like, I'll write questions for interviews, or I'll watch a movie, or I'll read a book  for an interview.  Right.  To be respectful, if I can.  But I don't, what is it a prep to, like, you know, you just hang out and chat, and maybe  it'll be...  Yeah, what's going to pop in my head at 9.15 tomorrow?  Does that mean we can stop prepping, too?  No, no, no.  They should start, actually.  Yeah, I stopped years ago.  But I have a bunch of, I wrote just a bunch of thoughts to say to people, not like, I'm not 
[00:56:00]  going to read a script, but just like, you know, things I would answer their questions.  Are there suggestions?  Most of them have been actual real questions.  I'm surprised.  Like, 80% of them have actually been legit fucking...  You got a sample of a question, kind of something?  Jim!  Jim?  I'm not too sure what to do about work.  What do you think?  No, it's like, Jim, I'm not good at my job, but I stay here out of force of habit. 
[00:56:30]  What should I do?  Sam R.  It must be somebody with similar initials.  No, I got one guy who, I actually wrote a couple of them back.  Girls?  Yes.  Hi.  It's funny you should say that.  I think a private session is more in your future.  But one guy who's having a hard time, and, you know, like, real, like, legit fucking...  Wow, real problem.  Oh, man, you got to fucking worry about, like, what kind of advice you're giving. 
[00:57:00]  Yeah, but you got to know where you're coming for advice.  I'm not exactly Dr. fucking Phil.  That's true.  Just don't give any nurse receptionist advice.  That was the fucking...  That was the tagline.  I'm not exactly Dr. fucking Phil.  That should be my tagline.  That would be a good tagline, yeah.  Yeah, but I got to do it, so...  But it's, like, some harrowing questions.  People were really into some shit.  Yeah, like, fucking really...  Oh, that's fucked up.  Like, ugh.  Like, fucking, you know...  Thanks, Kenny.  Oh, God.  I know, I know.  People that want to maybe, you know, take the, what they call the coward's way out. 
[00:57:30]  Yeah, the fucking final play.  I love how they say that.  The coward's way out.  Yeah, you do it.  It's hard, man.  It's fucking crazy.  Killing yourself is not easy.  I mean, the guys that do it, it's...  But to actually go through it is fucking hard.  Yeah, that's gotta be fucking crazy.  I don't recommend it.  I wouldn't either.  Is that your first bit of advice?  Yes, I don't recommend it.  I don't recommend suicide.  But I don't know how the calls are gonna be, so I'm like, fuck it, have some questions.  No, the calls will be...  You'll have calls the whole time? 
[00:58:00]  I think so, too, but, like, I mean, I want, like, you know, I want...  It'll be silly and funny, but it's, like, I want to have some questions that make, you know...  Yes.  I don't want to just do the Opie and Anthony show again.  You're gonna see another side of Jim Norton.  No, you won't.  It's the exact same side you see all the time.  I'm a one-level fucking one-trick pony.  It's gonna be fucking fart references and dick jokes and fucking chips.  Please.  Tune in with no expectations.  Yeah, well, if they're used to this show.  Exactly.  And this shit show.  I'll have no problem tuning in with no expectations. 
[00:58:30]  I'm not exactly replacing fucking...  Yeah.  I couldn't think of a show.  Good.  I was bracing myself for impact.  I know, right?  You want to take a break?  Yes.  And then we'll come back.  And I definitely...  There are a couple of things I wanted to discuss.  One of which was the Zimmerman-Trayvon case.  It's a little news.  I guess Zimmerman's lawyer is going after a few people that have been unfair to him.  Good, good.  And there was something else. 
[00:59:00]  The fucking execution right outside our old building.  Yes.  That's huge.  Awesome.  And then more developments on that Australian fucking radio show thing.  You know, I always say this, and then they just disappoint me wholeheartedly.  But we might take some calls today.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I say we take some calls today.  We'll give it a try.  Let's be a part of instead of a part from. 
[00:59:30]  Right.  Oh, that's a great motto.  More advice.  Thanks for the advice.  Feelings are not facts.  Yeah.  No one wasn't as good.  That was very good.  That's very true, too.  Because you feel a certain way.  It doesn't make it a fact.  No.  I don't get it.  You're kidding me.  I'm dumb.  Yeah.  All right.  We're going to.  Let's all eat.  Let's all eat.  Yeah. 
[01:00:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This one, the peppers were good.  Peppers kind of fell off, didn't they?  I think it was the whole time and place thing, you know?  That funk thing.  And it just got silly.  I always liked the peppers, though.  Oh, yuck. 
[01:00:30]  Until they got stupid.  I hate this song.  Give it away, give it away, give it away.  You don't like it?  It's fucking terrible.  Give it away now.  Give it away now.  Give it away, give it away, give it away, give it away now.  Fuck you.  Terrible.  I think they're the most overrated band in history.  Really?  Can't stand them.  One great song.  The rest of it's fucking awful.  The early Chili Peppers is pretty goddamn good. 
[01:01:00]  Play me another.  California.  Nah, that's like later.  That's later.  Play me another good one.  What's one of their quirky album names?  Play like.  Beard, hair, and eyes.  You don't like blood sugar sex magic?  No, I don't.  It's stupid.  Play something off of.  Yeah.  Flea's a great bass player, though.  Yeah.  Okay, yeah.  I'm not saying they're not great musicians. 
[01:01:30]  But don't work with Flea.  He'll rat you out to your boss.  McFry!  I don't.  Wait.  It's a tripe beat.  He's not going to like when it kicks in.  Here it is.  Average.  Too much like a rap.  It's too much like a white rapper. 
[01:02:00]  Hey, motherfucker, don't give a damn.  It was kind of a funk-based rap thing.  All right, yeah.  Funk.  Funkadelic.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I hate them.  I kind of liked it.  I liked it.  Do the way, do the way, do the way.  Ho, ho.  Ho, ho.  Darn, darn.  Tomorrow is the big 12-12-12, right?  Is that tomorrow?  Yes.  Tomorrow's 12-12-12-12-12.  Is that televised, yeah? 
[01:02:30]  Yeah, it's on Epix.  It's on...  It is on Epix.  Is it?  Yeah, they're simulcasting.  Where else is it?  I think it's on a couple other channels, yeah.  They say bigger audience than Live Aid.  It's going to be bigger than Live Aid.  Yeah, they're broadcasting all around the world.  Bigger than AIDS.  Bigger than AIDS, huh?  Bigger than AIDS.  Who's going to be there?  Everyone.  Who's actually doing this?  Eddie Vedder is, I think, headlining the whole thing.  What?  Is he really?  Well, no, he's on there.  He's one of the people calling.  Are we going to get to hear him talk?  That'll be good. 
[01:03:00]  Let's see.  Eddie Vedder.  McCartney's headline.  McCartney, yeah.  Kanye.  He'll probably want to go out after McCartney.  That cocky douche.  That dummy.  He wanted to go out after Metallica at Lollapalooza.  Yeah.  To be on the main stage.  And ooh, did he bomb.  Really?  He did?  Oh my...  Not Lollapalooza.  What's the one in fucking the South that I performed at?  Bonnaroo?  Bonnaroo.  Bonnaroo.  That fucking asshole Kanye was on a smaller stage.  I want to say after Jack Johnson, or whatever the guy's name is, and Dummy has to, you know, 
[01:03:30]  Baby Boy has to be on the main stage with his full dog shit stage show.  Metallica headlined the main stage.  Yeah.  So a couple hours later, they fucking load Baby Boy's fucking thing on, and little wittle  Baby Boy goes on, and his son is coming out, and he has this whole fucking stupid space  theme show, and he fucking bombs.  Yeah?  Yeah, you remember that?  Like 2008.  Oh, I guess so.  Or maybe 2009.  Good.  Good for you.  Bon Jovi.  Eric Clapton. 
[01:04:00]  Dave Grohl.  Layla.  Fucking shut up.  I love how Jim hates one of the best guitarists ever.  He's a great guitarist, but I hate him.  I hate his music, and I fucking hate the fact that he was fucking George Harrison's wife  behind his back.  Even though Harrison was fine with it after a while, I still hate him.  He's a little fucking snake.  He's a jealous little snake.  Non-Beatle.  Fuck him.  Dave Grohl.  I love Dave Grohl.  Dave Grohl.  Licked my head.  He was here yesterday.  Was he?  Yeah. 
[01:04:30]  Really?  Mm-hmm.  I didn't know that.  He saw his photos.  Yeah.  I love Dave Grohl.  Billy Joel.  Yeah, I like Billy Joel.  Alicia Keys.  Okay.  I like her.  Chris Martin.  She's got a weird body, Alicia Keys.  She can sing, though, man.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  She's got, like, a pretty face, but her body is fucking wack, yo.  She does have a strange body.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Weird.  Big ass.  Yeah, but it's not like a, like, it's almost like big and kind of square-ish.  And flat and square, yeah, yeah, square-ass.  It's from where he's sitting on the fucking piano seat, that's why.  Whoa.  Starting to look like a piano fucking chair. 
[01:05:00]  Oh.  I never thought of that.  Yeah, she's always sitting.  Who else?  Who else is it going to be?  Bruce.  Bruce.  How much for Bruce?  I think they started at 150, but it's all for charity.  Yeah.  And then they went up to a couple thousand.  How much time is everybody doing?  I would assume they're all doing, like, one or two songs, because there's so many.  Imagine what backstage has got to be like in that fucking situation.  The pandemonium.  Yeah, but the access is probably so limited backstage. 
[01:05:30]  Oh, I know.  But just the, yeah, exactly.  But all their own security people, all there keeping, like.  Butting heads.  Oh, yeah.  And you know Kanye's going to walk in with 12 people.  Of course.  The entourage Kanye will have.  Yeah.  Fuck Kanye.  I can't see.  He's a very talented guy, but I can't stand him.  Is he?  He is.  He's awesome.  Is he?  Oh, okay.  I was just asking.  Is he?  Who else?  So, Bruce Springsteen, Eddie Vedder, Roger Waters, Kanye West, The Who, Paul McCartney. 
[01:06:00]  Who?  Who?  Rolling Stones were added.  The Stones are doing it?  Yes.  Oh, my God.  Huge.  I wonder why Jay-Z is not on the show.  Oh, my fucking God.  Is that a lineup?  Wow.  That's pretty huge, man.  What?  God damn.  You know, this is all for you.  I know.  That's why I didn't even want to buy a ticket for you.  It's just going to me.  It's going to you.  At the garden?  Or hurricane-ravaged fucking town.  Yeah.  Like, shouldn't we just get in for free?  You should.  Can you imagine the fucking backstage?  McCartney and the Stones in the same area? 
[01:06:30]  You think anybody's going to be able to sneak back?  Oh, lots of celebrities will be there, too.  Yeah.  Oh?  Steve Buscemi.  Jessica Chastain.  What?  What are they going to do?  Come out on stage?  Actress.  Ladies and gentlemen.  Donate now.  Blah, blah, blah.  Chelsea Clinton.  Sean Combs.  Billy Crystal.  Leonardo DiCaprio.  Jimmy Fallon.  Jake Gyllenhaal.  Seth Meyers.  Chris Rock.  I couldn't handle being there with my camera.  Adam Sandler.  Oh, my God.  Right?  You'd lose your fucking mind, Jimmy. 
[01:07:00]  Brian Tarantino.  Brian Williams.  That would have been a great thing to sell.  For a million dollars, you get a photo with every artist there.  That's a big one.  Who would pay a million dollars?  Not a million.  Not a million.  Or whatever.  Whatever it is.  Not a million dollars.  He would try to find a million.  If he only had a million dollars, he would give it all just to get in that situation.  Because you'd have McCartney.  You'd have the Stones as a band.  You'd have Billy Joel.  Yeah.  Maybe not as a million dollars.  You'd have a million dollars, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, you're right.  It's on, like, every channel.  Oh, it is. 
[01:07:30]  AMC, The Cooking Channel, Encore, FX.  The Cooking Channel.  FX, Fuse, G4, HBO.  Like, everybody's showing it.  HBO Latino.  Yeah, MSG, MSG+.  Who's the actual headline act?  The Stones or McCartney?  I'm assuming it's going to be, like, a big, you know.  Because the only guy that can go on after the Stones is McCartney.  Like, if McCartney goes out and plays Let It Be, he can follow this.  No one he can't go on after.  I'm going to guess it's going to be the Stones and McCartney.  No, but one will have to go out and one will join the other.  Yeah. 
[01:08:00]  You think Mick Jagger will join in?  Mother Mary comes to me.  Come to me.  Mother Mary, come to me.  I'm going to bet Paul McCartney.  Did you hear about the Rolling Stones concert this weekend, right?  Yes.  And they've added, they're putting who?  Lady Gaga and...  Lady Gaga, Bruce Springsteen.  And Bruce Springsteen.  And the Black Keys.  All on their show.  On the stage with them?  Yeah.  It's going to be a pay-per-view.  Yeah, it's a pay-per-view.  It's the last show of their 50th anniversary tour.  Whoa. 
[01:08:30]  And so they're adding Gaga, Bruce, and the Black Keys to their stage show.  I did hear that.  Black Keys are big, right?  Very big.  Yeah.  Black Keys?  Yeah.  Oh.  They're not Gaga or Bruce Big.  No.  No, but as far as rock and roll goes, they're probably top three.  There's only three bands in rock and roll.  That's true.  Why are they doing that, though?  They don't need to do that.  The Stones?  Yeah.  To sell pay-per-views.  Yeah.  To sell pay-per-views.  I'm more likely to buy a Rolling Stones.  What is she going to sing?  Is she going to sing a Stones song?  I would sing something that sounds like Madonna.  Oh, they're coming out with them?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's a Stones concert. 
[01:09:00]  And Gaga will join them on stage.  You are such a Gaga fanboy.  It's called Little Monster.  Oh, yeah.  I'm a Little Monster, too, Ant.  Oh, God.  Please.  I love Mother Monster.  Oh, God, no.  Mother Monster.  Mother Monster's good.  She understands me.  You know who's promoting the pay-per-view?  Who?  Vince McMahon.  Wow.  It's his pay-per-view.  Really?  Mm-hmm.  That's a big one.  Has he ever ventured out into a pay-per-view that weren't wrestling?  He's tried.  He's done a couple of boxing things that didn't work out. 
[01:09:30]  Oh, of course.  He did some football thing, too, that didn't work out.  Yeah, a lot of people credited that to the pre-show not being very good.  I don't know.  True, true, true.  The pre-show was a really needed work.  What a dud.  What a dud.  Yeah.  Well, they didn't find the effort to get hosts.  No.  Not at all.  Yeah.  That was called pay me, motherfucker.  Did you guys put a lot of effort into the pre-show?  No.  And we told him, too.  It wasn't going to be any effort.  No.  Yeah, we told him.  You don't want to want to?  I want to see a minute of it because I don't remember it.  There's some funny stuff here.  I try not to remember. 
[01:10:00]  Why is my body so low?  Oh, my God.  This looks just like a beer, huh, Anthony?  Yeah, just like one.  We're going to watch tonight's game right here in Los Angeles or Las Vegas.  We were at Giants Stadium for the game.  Oh, you had your jersey on.  What was your team in the XFL?  Who the fuck cares?  Hold on.  Do you still have your jersey?  You know, to be on the field.  These fucking.  We have a little friendly competition between you and I, Opie.  See that football out there at the 20?  Well, every game starts with this.  And, you know, I saw it on TV.  It seems, like, really easy, like anyone could do it. 
[01:10:30]  You didn't see the guy get his shoulders separated during it?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You want to bet something?  I'll bet whatever you want.  All I know is I was freezing.  All right.  Could you pause this, please?  I want to go back over that moment of magic dialogue.  I want to hear the chemistry.  You want to bet?  I want to bet something these two guys.  Magic dialogue.  Neither one of you knew what to bet.  It was obviously a crafted scene with.  It's not like it was just improv on the spot. 
[01:11:00]  Oh, no.  Very well crafted.  This betty.  It's riveting because it keeps you going, like the big bet.  Oh, boy.  You are fucking.  You know, to be on the field, I think we're going to have a little friendly competition  between you and I, Opie.  See that football out there at the 20?  Well, every game starts with this.  And, you know, I saw it on TV.  It seems, like, really easy, like anyone could do it.  You didn't see the guy get his shoulders separated during it?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You want to bet something?  I'll bet whatever you want.  All right.  First beer. 
[01:11:30]  Oh, first beer.  I didn't hear.  First beer?  Now, look at him go.  I didn't know I'd be running in my work boots.  They're both running for the football.  Opie trips and Anthony falls on it.  Oh, boy.  Is that really how the game started?  Yeah.  Opie's going to retrieve the team.  Opie's running out onto the team.  Careful.  It seems somebody already took it.  What happened out there, Opie? 
[01:12:00]  There's no team.  Somebody else seems to have taken it.  You look like an ass.  Are you Jesse the body, Ventura?  No, I'm the body, but I'm Bob the body.  Go look.  Oh, boy.  Was he on Save the Bell?  Yeah, he was.  The new class.  No, no, the college years.  Oh, the fan moments.  Oh.  Oh, right.  It's like an episode of Oz. 
[01:12:30]  We were on the field for a while with the big football players, and it was very dangerous.  Nothing compared to being here.  Oh, yeah.  What's going to happen, Anthony?  All we wanted was to come down, maybe get a beer.  And we can't even move.  All right, enough.  I can't take me anymore.  Why are you guys taking a move?  Thank you.  Yeah, right.  I was just speaking with one of the sideline reporters who asked a football player something.  Very excited.  Anthony.  Yes, Anthony.  We just interviewing the sideline reporter.  That was sarcasm, by the way.  He had just talked to one of the men from the Bolts that made a very key play, Opie. 
[01:13:00]  That's what he said.  Very exciting talking to him after he talked to someone.  One of the men from the Bolts.  Who made a very key play, Opie.  Vince McMahon.  Wow.  It's an honor now.  Now, in some way, shape, or form, I knew this would happen.  We would end up employed in some way, shape, or form with something.  Some way, shape, or form twice.  One day, and you maybe don't know this yet.  Yes.  One day, you're actually going to be in the ring with tights on, flying around, taking what we call bumps.  Taking what we call bumps. 
[01:13:30]  Like my bedroom.  Even the tights.  These are the fans of the XFL.  Oh, yeah?  How many?  Eight of them.  We also heard you handpicked us for the job to host XFL Game Day.  Without question, because if there are two individuals who are eminently qualified to host this show, it's Opie and Anthony.  Now, did you mean...  Jealous?  Yeah.  Jealous?  Yes.  Or is there some confusion?  There's no reason to ask exactly yes.  We can make fun of you all day.  I'm very jealous.  But look, I'm fucking rapping with Vince McMahon. 
[01:14:00]  Of course.  He just knows who you are.  How sick is that?  He's like, yes, I did pick you, Anthony.  Exactly.  So fucking...  Suck on that.  Obviously, you haven't seen the show.  It's that bad.  No, it's so good.  So good.  That I think it might even go over your head.  No, why would we do that?  Okay, just double checking.  You know what?  It's so good, I don't even think you need to watch it.  Yeah.  It's that good.  It runs itself.  It runs itself.  Just like the XFL. 
[01:14:30]  Right.  Thank you guys very much.  Thank you, Vince.  Thank you, Vince.  A little bit of fun we had.  Oh, God.  Oh, cool.  Right back to the bar.  Cool.  You guys can drink on the job?  It's crazy.  We really are nuts.  We're just lunatics.  It would be obvious that you cheated.  Look at the camera work.  It's always got to move.  Right here, you pushed me.  I go flying by the ball.  Yeah.  And you end up with the ball right there.  Who has it at the end?  Thank you, bud.  Thank you.  You cheated.  You cheated.  You got the first beer, boy.  I'm a man of my word.  Here's your beer.  Thank you, Opie.  It's a TV beer, and you're drinking it with a straw, but there you go. 
[01:15:00]  Anthony, tonight's game, it's the Los Angeles Extreme taking on Las Vegas.  The Outlaws in Las Vegas.  Let's check in with Bruce with a preview.  Great.  Poor Bruce.  Did Vince McMahon ever yell at you?  No.  That would make me really jealous.  If you and Opie got pulled into a meeting and Vince.  You stink.  I told you what dog shit you were.  What a terrible show.  You are awful.  You're fucking up my whole program. 
[01:15:30]  You're fucked.  Nothing better than stories of Vince McMahon yelling at you.  Would you like Vince to yell at you?  Oh, my God.  I'd be in paradise.  If he was critiquing my performance on something.  And it wasn't good.  And it wasn't good.  I'd be like, oh, my God.  I'm here.  I'm here.  I'm here.  I'm here.  All right, people.  Anthony, who won the game?  No one knows.  Oh, boy.  Now, you were a little bit like, wow, look at that.  They're talking to Vince McMahon.  Yeah.  And he said, Opie and Anthony, that he picked you guys. 
[01:16:00]  Now, you've spoken with a lot of wrestlers.  Yes.  Rasslers.  Sure.  And even a few that you know on a first-name basis.  Yeah, I know some of them.  Have you ever spoken to Vince?  Yeah, I've interviewed him twice briefly.  Like at press events, though.  Did he know you?  No, he doesn't know me.  All right.  Got that over on you.  He doesn't know me.  I got that over you.  It's not the same context.  No, it's not.  As you.  You made me very jealous.  That was cool. 
[01:16:30]  That was an awful fucking show.  There was no rhyme or reason to it.  Like, no one knew what the fuck was going on.  I performed for that audience, though.  I remember it was early in my days with Opie and Anthony.  And I performed at that.  When I see you guys with that awful background, with like a black background with a weird little stars in it.  It was a weird.  At the restaurant?  Yeah.  It was at the Hard Rock.  DWF New York.  It was called the WWF New York at the time.  Oh, that's what it was. 
[01:17:00]  I'm sorry.  Yeah.  Same thing, though.  It ended up being Hard Rock.  I remember doing stand-up.  Me, Voss.  I had been going in for a little while.  The crowd kind of knew who I was.  Yeah.  But that's got to be 2000.  Oh, God.  Or was it 2001?  I was sad when they shut it down.  I think it was pre-firing.  Oh, and I know it was.  So that's 2000, right?  2002 was firing.  Okay.  August 2002.  Well, thank God it didn't last long. 
[01:17:30]  It was just nothing.  They told us, you guys don't have to worry about a thing.  You just show up.  We'll take care of everything.  And then we showed up, and no one was taking care of anything.  And they're just like, what do you guys want to do here?  You're supposed to have it all scripted out and tell us where to be.  You guys just be you.  We hired you for you.  So just give us Opie and Anthony.  There was one episode that they taped, and then they came back to edit it.  And they realized that some guy up front was making jerk-off motions to us as we were on stage. 
[01:18:00]  And he was in the front row and doing that, you know, forced perspective thing of jerking us off.  And they couldn't use any of the long shots.  They had to use all tight shots that day.  The guy was so pissed.  He was so fucking pissed.  Yeah, it was quite awful.  Yeah, that's the one.  That right there.  Can you put that up?  What are they doing there?  Oh, no.  Game bait.  That was a good deal.  I'm telling everybody what a great show it's going to be. 
[01:18:30]  A little bit about this program, XFL Game Day.  This is a pregame show the way it's supposed to be.  It's a party.  Look at me.  It's a party.  This is not your father's pregame show.  This is XFL Game Day.  Oh.  All right.  All right.  I know.  Let's leave it.  Let's leave it.  Let's leave it.  Let's go ahead to the field for a few of the games.  I'm pumped.  Don't expect us to get too close to the players.  But we're going to take you in the locker rooms.  We're going to take you behind the scenes. 
[01:19:00]  We're going to take you into the stands to see the crowd and the beautiful cheerleaders  of the XFL.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Lady.  We're going to get up close and closer with the XFL cheerleaders.  I can't watch this.  We're going to do a little of that tonight.  Wait, rewind that.  I missed that line.  I can't watch this.  Why are you doing this tonight?  It's actually not that bad.  It's terrible.  We're going to take you behind the scenes.  We're going to take you into the stands to see the crowd and the beautiful cheerleaders  of the XFL. 
[01:19:30]  Oh, my God.  No.  That's right, Anthony.  We're going to get up close and personal with the XFL cheerleaders.  We're going to do a little of that tonight.  What a crowd, man.  What a crowd.  Yeah.  Great crowd.  Anthony, let's also tell everyone, join us for game day.  We got Bruce Beck and Rusty Tillman, the coach of the New York, New Jersey hitman. 
[01:20:00]  Rusty Tillman.  Anthony, great to be with you and a pleasure to be joined by Rusty Tillman.  I remember that day, too.  I mean, I remember fucking.  It was difficult.  That crowd was great, man.  I'm sure there's more.  Would you just fucking know?  Why?  You want to get close with the cheerleaders?  I can't.  I can't.  Did you think it was the next big thing in football?  Well, it was smash mouth football the way it's supposed to be played.  So I assumed Vince McMahon at the helm, it couldn't fail.  That's what I assumed. 
[01:20:30]  You and Opie were thinking, well, if we were at the NFL from the beginning, imagine how  well we'd be doing today.  Exactly.  Oh, my God.  Anthony, you sound cool.  Oh, you fucking assholes.  Oh, the hitman's bus.  Oh, it's the players.  Wait, no, no.  Oh, oh.  You thought it was the players, Ian.  That sounded very WWF right there.  Oh, no.  The players' buses are on.  Wait, no, no.  Beautiful.  Now, this is what football's all about.  Okay, I was being sarcastic.  Trust me. 
[01:21:00]  I was being sarcastic.  Obviously, the cheerleaders are here, and we're going to meet them next.  It's XFL game day.  Yeah, I look so comfortable on stage.  I'm trying to...  The cheerleaders, by the way, are just dressed like fucking a bunch of moms.  Yeah.  None of them have...  Yeah, what the fuck?  You're right.  They're walking from one end to the other.  None of them have sexy outfits on.  They're walking across the stage.  Those fucking whores.  They're not even stopping.  You're not meeting them.  Oh, God, stop. 
[01:21:30]  Please, please stop.  We're going to watch the cheerleaders walk by us in regular clothes and waves.  Chip, you like the guitar?  Fucking heavy.  I'd have fucked all those girls.  They needed...  Chip Chino hosted us.  What they needed was a fucking crowd.  You guys have been waiting for...  They wish they could get the crowd without us.  It's time to meet the New Jersey hitman cheerleaders.  Oh, you are meeting them.  Okay.  Yeah, they are.  Oh, they're going to dance.  Oh, my God.  This is so bad.  But I will tell you, with the crowd going crazy like that, it doesn't look nearly as awful 
[01:22:00]  as it could.  Like, you know...  Oh.  Especially since instead of XFL, they were chanting O and A.  I know, right?  They're just your radio fans.  But it was a statement of how big the show was.  I mean, you guys have a fucking massive audience there.  A bunch of dumb fucking...  Yeah, but look at that.  Mutants.  Look at that.  Oh, and I had a stronger audience than the XFL did.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, here's the...  Here you guys are.  Ladies, let's get to going one-on-one.  Ladies. 
[01:22:30]  She's getting the crowd hyped up by...  What's up, New York?  All right.  I am Envy.  I love you too, baby.  She's holding on to Anthony's arms.  Giant Stadium.  Yeah.  She's not quite my type.  I can't wait to be right up in the middle, whining you all the way up.  All right, sister.  Sit down, sister.  All right.  What's your name?  Hi, I'm Yoon, and I'm here to cheer for you, New York. 
[01:23:00]  You're not you.  You're me.  Hey, I'm Carla, and you know I came to New York City just to cheer for the hit men.  What's up?  Why didn't they bring a white woman over to me?  For God's sake.  What's your name?  Hi, my name's Jillian, and XFL runs, baby!  It's a lot like chick, these girls.  I'm from New York City, and...  Can I get a white chick?  Wait, pause this.  How about one of them just goes,  Hi, I'm Brenda.  I grew up in a small town, and I'm here today. 
[01:23:30]  They'll have to yell something rock and roll.  Yes.  Oh, no.  I'm Leslie Nicole, and I'm from Brooklyn, New York.  Oh, Brooklyn was in the hizzy.  Hey!  Oh, there we go.  I'm Caroline.  I'm from New York City, and we're here to show you some pizza!  But she says Boutte.  Boutte.  And what's your name?  Boutte.  Hi, I'm Ma'am, and we are going to rock your world!  Whoa!  Pause, by the way.  Who was it that said Twatte?  It was Brittany Andrews.  Was that who it was? 
[01:24:00]  Yeah.  Twatte.  Twatte.  She's really annoying.  Why are we watching the introduction of every cheerleader?  Come on, now.  Enough of this.  I like your haircut.  I've had it.  Oh, please.  I know.  This is fucking all right.  Opie looks 14.  He looks like he's fucking 14 years old.  I like that the cheerleaders are all like, XFL rules!  There hasn't been one game yet.  How do you know if the hitmen are good?  Like everybody's got a hitman loyalty already.  The New York, New Jersey hitmen.  Two states!  Fucking horrendous.  That's hilarious! 
[01:24:30]  Yeah, where's the team loyalty coming up?  How can it be?  There's no one that they haven't played yet.  Not only does the team not exist, the league doesn't exist yet.  There hasn't been a game.  All you've seen is footballs and logos.  And Bruce Beck and Rusty Tillman talking about how great the team is.  And Opie and Anthony.  They would do the technical aspect of the show.  Bruce Beck and Rusty Tillman would talk about the players and the plays and all that.  The color commentary.  Because they don't want to lose that audience of hardcore football fans. 
[01:25:00]  We were the rock and roll part of the XFL.  You know, because it was football with an attitude.  Fuck yeah!  They were the football part.  We were the attitude.  Fuck yeah!  You like the XFL, Chip?  Fuck yeah!  Oh, it was fucking hot.  I was a big hitman fan because I'm a hitman.  Yeah, did you like the hitmen?  Fuck yeah!  Smash mouth, cocksucker.  You fucking awful.  I was just an abomination.  The New York, New Jersey hitmen.  And the tri-state area birds. 
[01:25:30]  Oh, shut up.  I think I might have every XFL game on tape.  Yeah, why wouldn't you?  Because you can't get them anywhere on DVD or whatever.  Yeah, I think I have a box of all the XFL games.  Get rid of your dumb tapes.  Because it was related to Vince McMahon and wrestling.  I was the only one watching by the end.  Oh, yeah.  Of the Wikipedia founded 2000, ceased, 2001.  Wow, it only lasted a year, huh?  That was it.  It literally, it went from like, the first game had really good ratings, I remember. 
[01:26:00]  It was a Saturday night, and it had like amazing ratings.  We thought we were fucking riding it to the stars.  Within two weeks, the games had, I remember the articles.  At that time, it was the lowest ratings in television history.  Like, it was the lowest rated program in all of television history.  What was the problem with it?  Like, was it that no one could get new team loyalty, you think?  Like, it's just hard to create a sports league.  Yeah, because they were subpar players, because the good players were in the NFL. 
[01:26:30]  Very subpar.  The rules didn't make sense.  And no one wanted to watch that much football.  I mean, it was...  Yeah, he just finished.  The season was right after the NFL season.  And after the Super Bowl, you're like, oh, I'm going to watch some fucking not even college players.  Yeah.  Yeah, it was just horrible.  I'm trying to start a Jacks League or Tiddlywinks.  Although, He Hate Me went on to the NFL.  Did he?  He hate me.  Who's that?  He was the big star in XFL. 
[01:27:00]  They all got to have...  He was the man.  They got to wear weird things on the back of their jerseys.  They didn't necessarily have to put their name on the back of the jersey.  They could put, like, weird things.  So, He Hate Me was...  He hate me.  See, there's certain things when you do that.  You think you're being cool and crazy.  But you're compromising a weird, consistent integrity in the game.  Like, it just makes it clownish and people don't like it.  Right.  Right.  Well, they tried to bring some of the aspects of wrestling...  Yeah, it's silly.  ...to football.  Jesse Ventura was doing play-by-play for the football. 
[01:27:30]  Oh, man.  It was like...  They worked on Saturday night's main event.  He's not a football guy, though.  Yeah, here's the...  He's got to make a tackle here.  Well, obviously, someone stole the ball.  What?  It's a conspiracy.  Okay.  Jesse, why did this football...  Oh, it was...  But after that first game, with the huge ratings...  I mean, I was picturing, like...  I was picturing us, you know...  Well, it's been 20 years.  This is our 20th year here at XFL Game Day. 
[01:28:00]  Did you guys think that, you know...  If we do well with this XFL thing...  They may end up moving us over to Monday Night Raw...  And we may be...  We're going to be on TV regularly.  I...  Yeah.  Oh, I thought that was, you know...  The next big step.  Yeah.  Right there.  We were in the middle of it.  Really?  Were you fucking packing up and moving to Dorktown?  No, we were already there.  Believe me.  No, I...  Look, that could have been great.  I mean...  Oh, it is.  The crowds were very impressive that showed up.  Oh, yes. 
[01:28:30]  For you guys.  That's the only reason we were there.  Because they knew we could fill the fucking place up with people.  The only reason.  I remember after, like, the third episode or something like that was...  We got brought up to the office and was like, yeah, this...  Yeah, they're just scrapping the whole thing.  The whole pregame?  Yeah.  It's like, oh...  Did they replace you guys?  No, they just went with no pregame.  Yeah, they eliminated the pregame.  Was it doing well in the ratings?  Um, no.  It was actually the only thing doing worse than the XFL.  Yes, yes, yes. 
[01:29:00]  No one was tuning in for the pregame.  Before the game, no one tuned in for.  I wish Vince McMahon had given you that speech, though.  Yeah.  I just told you how shitty a job you guys have done.  It's ranked number two on ESPN's list of biggest flops in sports.  What?  What's number one?  The XFL.  Oh, yeah.  It's number one.  The pregame itself.  Open Anthony's pregame show.  The pregame show.  The USFL?  Ryan Leaf.  Wow.  Is he done?  Yeah.  What years did he supposedly play?  98, 2001.  And then wasn't he the big guy at one point? 
[01:29:30]  Well, yeah.  He was like.  The big draft?  Yeah.  And what happened?  It just didn't work out.  It happens all the time.  He was a bigger flop than the XFL, though?  That's what ESPN said.  Is he?  I don't buy that.  Did he get paid?  XFL was a giant fucker.  I'm sure he got paid.  Ryan Leaf.  What's he doing now?  Let's see.  Is he out of football for good, you think?  Yes.  I'm pretty sure.  His last comeback was in 2002 with the Cowboys, and they released him.  Wow.  He was supposed to be like a big thing?  Yeah.  I didn't know.  I remember the name. 
[01:30:00]  I don't remember who he was playing for.  In 2009, he was indicted on burglary and controlled substance charges.  Oh, boy.  In March, he was arrested on burglary, theft, and drug charges.  Four days later, he was arrested again on burglary, theft, and criminal possession of dangerous drugs.  So is he stealing to support a drug habit?  Probably, yeah.  Didn't he get a big contract or not?  In June, he was sentenced to seven years.  Oh, my God.  Holy shit.  But, wow, he's doing well, I guess. 
[01:30:30]  It's always sad to me when people have so much potential, or it looks like things are going to be so amazing,  and then they just...  Who was the big draft that year?  It was him.  Get off the dude.  And someone else.  I know the name Ryan Leaf, and I don't follow draft picks.  Peyton Manning.  Wow.  Who's he?  Didn't Ryan Leaf go first?  Yes.  Oh, man.  He's the number one pick?  No.  Oh.  Wow.  That's a...  Get your shit straight, Travis.  That's a fall from grace right there, huh?  Jeez. 
[01:31:00]  You got to watch them drugs, people.  You got to get off the drugs.  Three years in the NFL.  Maybe he didn't.  Maybe he didn't.  Yeah, Manning went first, and then Leaf went second to the judges.  What was his contract?  Can you say?  Yeah.  Four years, 31 million.  Wow.  Holy shit.  Guaranteed 11 million signing bonus.  So he blew that money?  Probably, yeah.  Oh, my God.  He blew the money and ended up in fucking prison.  Doing burglaries for drugs.  Like, you should be able to, like...  Wow, my NFL career didn't work out, but at least I got this 11 million.  Dude, I haven't burned through 11 million in my life. 
[01:31:30]  11 million?  No.  In 10 years?  I haven't burned through 11,000 in my life.  Oh, you.  I've never seen 11,000.  You got your whole life in front of yourself.  I did at one point.  Don't you?  I did.  You're saying you did?  You don't anymore?  No.  You don't consider yourself...  What are you, 40 now?  No.  No?  I'm approaching 30.  Oh, 30.  Rapidly, right?  Yeah.  You're barreling.  Barreling into 30.  Nine months.  So what do you want to talk about with Zimmerman?  I'm guessing it's the same thing that I thought was about the lawsuit.  Yes, the Zim.  The lawsuit?  Yes, the lawsuit against NBC. 
[01:32:00]  Good.  For making him look like fucking a racist and a criminal.  This guy's...  They keep saying justice for Trayvon, for the love of God.  How about justice for the case?  Like, you want to find out the truth and what happened here.  People who are...  It's hard to kind of, like...  By default, it feels like if you're supporting Zimmerman...  Not only you, I mean anybody.  It feels like you're against Trayvon, but it's not the case. 
[01:32:30]  Because he really didn't do anything wrong.  He was just an unarmed guy walking home who got...  Scroll down on that page.  No, down, I mean up.  And Zimmerman was one of these annoying wannabe cop guys.  Look at his nose.  Jesus, did he get fucking punched.  Yeah, he was one of these annoying wannabe cop guys.  Yeah, you think?  Yeah, but out of doubt.  Neighborhood watch.  Yeah, but you're supposed to just see something, you call the cops.  He did.  You don't get paid for that.  He did.  But he was walking around.  Like, I'm not saying he deserved to get beat up, but that's what one of those wannabe cop guys does. 
[01:33:00]  If you were in the situation where he was seeing somebody walking around that looked exactly like people that robbed the fucking neighborhood,  you're going to keep an eye on him.  Sure.  You're going to see what happens until the cops get there.  Just keeping an eye on him.  Not following him.  Not fucking, you know, harassing him.  Right.  And then Trayvon apparently starts punching him in the fucking face.  So, whatever.  Whatever. 
[01:33:30]  I don't know.  Who knows what happened with that confrontation?  Exactly.  You don't know.  It'll come out in the trial, I guess, as much as can come out through witnesses and stuff and fiscal evidence.  But NBC edited some audio.  Terribly.  To make it sound like he was a racist.  And they're suing.  Thank God.  Good.  And NBC is disputing the accusations.  How?  They fired the guy that did it.  They said there was no intent to portray Mr. Zimmerman unfairly. 
[01:34:00]  Well, let someone decide that when they hear the fucking recordings.  I don't know how they're going to win that.  They're not.  They're going to settle.  Because anyone that doubts the media bias as far as, like, I was talking to Keith and this comedian named Mike, a black comic from Brooklyn, about this Trayvon thing.  Yeah.  And about the editing of the fucking, it's like, it's not about black people who don't get punished.  They get punished.  They go to jail.  Of course.  But it's the way the fucking press portrays it.  Like, why would they do that?  What's their motivation behind doing that? 
[01:34:30]  Trying to make Zimmerman seem whiter than he is.  Trying to make it look like it was purely about he hated blacks.  Like, what the fuck was the advantage to that?  Viewers, they want people to watch to be, to make it compelling.  It's a lot more compelling a story if it's a white guy that killed an unarmed black child unjustly.  Yeah.  So they want to make it, and oh, if he's a racist, oh, if we got some evidence that he's a racist, that's exactly it. 
[01:35:00]  It's just to get people to watch.  So they really are.  It's just a self-serving thing by the press.  Absolutely.  The whole race thing is literally just to boost ratings.  Boost ratings because they know it's one of those issues that just fucking, oof, people will jump all over it.  They're creating the news because then blacks get upset and start to, because if they showed all race case and report, like, maybe this guy Zimmerman is racially biased.  Like, do I think that he would have followed me or Travis the same way?  No.  I do not think so. 
[01:35:30]  He made a judgment, a stereotype judgment, and he was wrong.  He made a wrong judgment, and things got out of hand.  So if you show it, like, every time something happens black on white and you talk about the race, and then you show white on black and talk about it, it loses its effect.  Yeah, yeah.  Because you're talking about it all the time.  If you only talk about the white on black, it's still – because if it's black on white, white people aren't going to sit outside and fucking protest.  That's not going to be – news is not going to cover that. 
[01:36:00]  I don't know why there isn't more of an outrage on black on white.  Why isn't there more of a fucking outrage?  One of the reasons is because the press doesn't report it that way.  Because it happens a fuck of a lot more.  Because the press doesn't report it that way.  They always report it like the robbery is the motive.  That it's just a crime.  Like, they're just animals who are grabbing for what's theirs.  Right.  Like, they can't seem to think that black people have the same angry or ugly thought process as white people.  It's a way of making them less intellectual.  Terrible.  I mean, we could go right into that other story of that woman on the elevator. 
[01:36:30]  She's a fucking 85-year-old woman.  She's white.  They have security footage of her going into her lobby.  There's a large black gentleman in the lobby.  Follows her in.  And you can tell she's kind of – he's trying to talk to her.  She's kind of very leery about the whole thing.  But she gets into the elevator.  Now, this is the part where I was like, what the fuck?  This is what political correctness has done.  And I think this ties in to the Zimmerman angle because when he saw Trayvon walking down the street, it's the same line as seeing this guy by the elevator. 
[01:37:00]  You look at it.  You identify a black guy in a hoodie walking around your neighborhood that has been robbed by black guys in hoodies.  You're going to be suspicious.  I understand that.  I understand that.  I stereotype, too.  So this woman absolutely should not have gotten in that elevator with that black guy standing there because she's racist? 
[01:37:30]  No, because you've got to play the odds.  It's not in her best interest to step into that fucking elevator with that guy right there.  Because let me see, Travis.  She should have stayed in the fucking lobby or walked out the front door and found somebody else to assist her.  But no, this guy has no business being there.  Because her instinct.  Oh, you know why?  Here's what happens.  The guy is sitting in the chair.  Right.  The woman gets onto the elevator. 
[01:38:00]  Right.  The guy sees her getting on the elevator.  He jumps up, walks towards the elevator and opens it and she tries to walk out.  Like, so she actually.  She did try to walk out.  She did try to walk out.  She didn't think he was going to get on with her.  I can see why she got on because.  Oh, man.  He sits down.  He sat down.  Oh, no, no, no.  Wait, wait, wait.  What the hell happened there?  No.  Maybe she didn't think he was going to follow her on. 
[01:38:30]  Right, right.  That must have been somebody else getting in the elevator when he was sitting.  Oh, okay.  And she sees this guy trying to get on.  She tries to get off.  Wow.  And this fucking animal just pushes her against the thing, leans over, takes her stuff.  Takes her shit.  Took her wedding ring, too.  Of course.  Which, uh.  Of course.  She was coming back from a nursing home where her dying husband was.  It's on life support.  Yeah, on life support.  And this savage takes her fucking wedding ring.  And she even asked him. 
[01:39:00]  I guess it's in the clip.  Yeah.  Yeah, let's listen to what she said.  She was interviewed.  Yvonne Sherwell-Democopoulos returned to the lobby of the West 13th Street apartment where she became the victim of the unthinkable.  It's been so fast that I, of course, you land there and you're terrified.  The absolutely sickening crime was caught on surveillance video.  Watch closely as this brute follows Yvonne inside the building late Saturday night.  The longtime tenant appears skeptical of the unknown man from the start.  And as they quarreled inside the elevator, he violently pushes her to the ground, 
[01:39:30]  her legs flailing in shock.  The suspect not only took cash and her purse, but one particular item, the unwedding victim,  whose husband is on life support, desperately begged to keep.  And, of course, here's my husband who is dying.  And he took my Greek wedding ring.  And I asked him.  I didn't think he was going to menace me.  So I asked him.  I said, please give me my wedding ring back.  But he didn't and took off.  Here's a closer shot of the guy police are looking for. 
[01:40:00]  A black male around 35 years old, between six feet and six foot three.  You can see he was seen wearing a sweatshirt and a brown winter hat.  He looked very, very at ease, very.  And he was just waiting for his prey.  His prey.  Yeah.  I mean, it's there's such a fucking problem there that no one wants to address.  And what she should have done.  Like, here's the thing, because you get these weird instincts about people and it's not always  right.  But a lot of times it is. 
[01:40:30]  Like, if there was a big black guy standing there in a suit or just, you know, a guy looked  like Ruben Stuttered.  You probably wouldn't get that fear if he was just this regular guy.  It's a weird thing.  That guy looked like a thug.  He looked like a fucking problem.  Thug.  Um, and her, his energy was probably thug energy.  Yes.  He probably didn't come off nice and her instinct probably picked it up immediately and she  didn't listen to herself.  People don't listen to their first instincts because they don't want to come off or even  think of themselves as having any kind of racial bias. 
[01:41:00]  Yep.  You gotta fucking think like that.  She should have said, I'm waiting for somebody here.  Oh, look, a hoodie.  Wow.  Is he, is he there in support of Trayvon wearing a hoodie?  It's the fucking uniform of the thug.  Yeah.  The fucking hoodie is a thug uniform.  Yes.  Not on you, Travis.  On Travis, no.  On Travis, you look like a fucking lesbian walking through an all-male bar.  If you're a black male and you want to walk around with a hoodie on, you're gonna be fucking 
[01:41:30]  profiled.  You're gonna be.  Sorry.  Take it up with all the fucking black males that, that are ravaging people, uh, uh,  that are wearing hoodies.  Take it up with your fucking community.  Don't blame white people that, that are following you around stores and fucking giving you shit  and profiling you at every turn because you know what?  It's, it's the, that's the profile.  You can't fucking get away from it.  How about a hoodie footie?  Now, if you have a hoodie footie pajamas, they'll profile you as a cutie, as a sweet boy. 
[01:42:00]  It's fucking disgusting.  The, the amount of black on white crime also is just, God, it's, it's astounding how much  it happens.  It happens a lot and it's not reported.  What bothers me is just that the bias is, the fact that it happens isn't reported as  such.  No.  Like, it's like, just report it.  You know what the motive is there.  Right.  He's a weak white target and they went after him for that. 
[01:42:30]  So just say that.  Don't, but they never will.  They just won't.  And we have to accept that they're never going to do it.  FBI hate crime stats came out, uh, yesterday for 2011 and it's predominantly black victims  and white perpetrators of, of hate crimes.  And you'd read it and think like, wow, that's, uh, that's terrible.  No.  Because they never do it the other way around.  No, they report it differently.  And the stupid, you know what?  Fuck the police departments for reporting it that way too.  Exactly.  That's coming from police department reports because they don't want their stats to be 
[01:43:00]  high or they're told to keep it down or whatever.  But that it's, they're, they're guilty of reporting it that way too.  It's not just the press.  It really is, uh, infuriating because every crime that's, uh, perpetrated against a black  person by a white person is instantly looked at as a hate crime.  Uh, but black against white, which far out.  Did you say black against white twice?  I said no.  White against black is always a hate crime, no matter what the circumstance is.  Black against white is rarely ever a hate crime. 
[01:43:30]  They just look at it like, no, this is just a robbery.  No, this is just an assault.  No matter what's said.  Or it's in a pepper.  Ah, that's a good one.  No, it's done.  Uh, and, and black on white crime far exceeds white on black crime.  So how much is, uh, is Zimmerman asking?  Black on black crime is fucking crazy.  Crazy high.  Outnumbers everything.  Yeah.  Why?  How much is Zimmerman asking for?  18 billion gazillion trillion dollars.  He has a legit lawsuit.  That was a terribly edited, who the fuck is the news to edit any 9-1-1 call? 
[01:44:00]  Right?  How dare they?  Yeah, it's completely inaccurate.  God, they're fucking pigs, man.  You can't trust any of them.  It twisted around the meaning of that whole 9-1-1 call.  Yeah, it wasn't like they cut out a couple of minutes of silence while somebody was running or just crazy screaming.  They, they did that with motive.  They changed the, the whole essence of the call.  And they're going to say they didn't.  But anybody, we have the common understanding of fucking English. 
[01:44:30]  Anyone listening to that knows that they changed that meaning.  Yes, absolutely.  I was very flattered last night on Twitter.  I noticed that Zimmerman's brother has a Twitter and he's always tweeting things in defense of his brother and taking on some of these black activists that are tweeting things about his brother.  And, um, I went to follow him and realized he was already following me.  Wow.  I know. 
[01:45:00]  You mean the brother of the fucking, of the wannabe cop who fucking couldn't keep his gun in his pocket?  There's a fan of, wow.  Doesn't get any better than that, does it?  I was flattered.  The brother of, he's a celebrity.  The brother of fucking Zimmerman.  Your brother shot a guy with Skittles.  Yes.  I was like, wow.  He's following me.  So I, uh.  Well, I guess that's what both of them do then.  They just follow people.  Yes.  Literally. 
[01:45:30]  Thanks.  There it is.  He's following me.  There he is.  What is it?  R. Zimmerman Jr.  Jr.  By the way, Andy Ray raises a great point about how full of shit I am.  Because I was saying you shouldn't follow and he goes, this from the guy following the New York bus for 20 minutes.  Oh, right.  Look at you.  So, yeah, you're right.  Oh, I wish the bus driver got out and punched you in the nose.  Yeah, because he thought I was trying to bother him.  No, I was just following the bus. 
[01:46:00]  It had its light on.  The light on.  I'm an idiot.  You thought I was stolen.  Oh, you're adorable.  Yes, I did.  It said stolen bus call, please.  You are adorable.  Boy, did you.  I did, but I couldn't believe they weren't sending anybody.  You're a fucking rat.  You were outraged.  You're a fucking rat.  Yes, I was trying to help everybody.  You were trying to do your civic duty.  Yes, I was putting myself at risk for all of you.  Was that what you were doing?  Mm-hmm.  That's ridiculous.  And there was a fucking shooting right in front of our old building.  Yes.  A block away.  It was like a fucking mob.  She was a black dude.  Black dude.  But it was like a mafia-style shooting.  Yeah, this guy was from L.A., the victim, apparently. 
[01:46:30]  He was in New York from L.A., which is weird, because that even makes it a little strange.  East coast, west coast.  Something going on.  He was walking down the street, and this black guy just comes kind of jogging up behind him,  pulls a gun out, instantly just shoots him right in the back of the head.  That guy drops dead, and then walks a few more steps, hops into a waiting car, and drives off.  That is definitely some type of business being tended to. 
[01:47:00]  I'm hearing drug-related.  Drug-related.  Well, you could assume that, looking at the principles involved, that there might be an  issue with drug-related violence.  That scene in American Gangster, when Denzel just shoots him in broad daylight.  Broad daylight, right there on the street.  That's what that shit was, yo.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He had a beef.  But he got into a car on 57th Street, and they drove down 7th.  Well, you better fucking do that at the right time of day.  Oh, man.  It's fucking 4.30, and the suspect leaped into a car. 
[01:47:30]  Police caught them an hour later when they had moved 20 feet.  Yeah, they're not even chasing.  They're three cars apart with the lights going,  Woo, woo, woo.  Wow, that's a lot of fucking...  Is that all blood?  Yes.  That guy bled out from the head pretty thoroughly.  Yeah, I think that's what happens when you get shot in the head.  And the head at point-blank with a big gun.  Imagine walking down the street and then being dead.  You didn't even realize that your life was that thing.  I wonder if he ever saw it coming, yeah. 
[01:48:00]  Probably not.  Hit him right in the back of the head.  You just are alive one minute, and then all of a sudden you're dead.  I imagine that's for you sometimes.  Why?  Why?  It's not funny.  That's something, too, that you just can't defend against.  No, I'm good.  Unless you're just looking around, constantly jumping around.  You can wear those mirrored sunglasses that they  put in spy kits with the mirrors on the back.  Oh, fucking nice.  Like you buy from, like, backs of comic books.  Right, and that way you could always watch your back.  Fuck that shit.  I'm going for some fucking True Lies cigarette pack glasses. 
[01:48:30]  Where you have the cigarette pack with the camera in it,  and you put the glasses on, and then you just hold the cigarette pack  at your side and look behind you.  Then you put it on the sink in the bathroom.  You take a piss, and when the guys pull the gun out, you go,  pew, pew, pew, pew.  Gotcha.  Gotcha.  Yeah.  Could do that, too.  That seems like a specific scenario, though.  Oh, hell yeah.  Want to take a little break?  Yeah, I want to go to the bathroom, and we have a good week.  We were supposed to have Snooker today, but I guess his wife's not feeling well, 
[01:49:00]  so he's going to be next week.  Yeah.  And we have Quentin Tarantino on Thursday.  Quentin Tarantino.  And my new CD comes out today.  It was taped in 2007 in Boston.  I taped two together.  It's No Baby for You.  I love this set.  I was going to release it two years ago, but I didn't.  Oh, silly you, Jimmy.  But it's good, and it holds up pretty well.  So if you like it, go on iTunes and get it.  I hope you do.  Quentin's promoting Django. 
[01:49:30]  Are you going to see that?  I'm seeing that tomorrow night.  Django.  Django.  I want to see that tomorrow.  Django.  Django.  The D's silent.  D's silent.  What?  Looks great.  Never heard of that.  I hear the word niggers used 300 times.  Literally 300 times.  Wow, it's like you driving home.  Oh, boy.  Any outrage about that?  Not yet.  Any outrage?  I mean, Roland said 300 times.  I mean, that literally means every 30 seconds the word has to be used. 
[01:50:00]  All right.  I don't know for sure.  And?  There won't be any, because Jamie Foxx is the star.  That's true.  If there's any outrage, he'll just...  If you remember, Spike Lee got pissed off at Tarantino for putting that word into Pulp Fiction too much.  And Reservoir Dogs.  Tarantino doesn't care.  No, he doesn't.  He was referring to a whole storage facility of them.  Well, true that.  But, uh...  That's some of the best dialogue. 
[01:50:30]  That's hilarious.  Gentlemen, let's not start sucking each other's dicks quite yet, gentlemen.  Like when they are done, and everything is cool.  We're all gonna suck some dicks.  Then some dicks are gonna get sucked.  As Jimmy makes the coffee.  That gourmet shit.  Yeah.  Uh...  Yeah, that fucking shit is great.  When Bonnie goes to the store, she buys shit.  She buys shit.  Jewels.  Okay, jewels.  When we come back, we talk about the, uh...  Radio people.  Oh, yes. 
[01:51:00]  The old Zs.  There's more radio people stuff.  The ad bag.  Get a blaming onion.  And stike.  That guy is the fucking worst.  It's so annoying.  The Outback commercial accent guy.  Yeah, we'll talk about, uh...  That after...  These words.  The O.P.  Anthony Channel.  Channel.  Channel.  Channel.  Channel.  On SiriusXM.  I was driving home, and I was behind a bus.  You know, like the bus has an automatic sign?  911, call police. 
[01:51:30]  I call 911.  911, what is the emergency?  I'm on, uh...  10th Avenue northbound, and I'm behind a bus.  And the sign says, call 911.  I thought it was a stolen bus.  I didn't know what was happening.  There could have been hostages.  I mean, we all saw that Keanu Reeves movie.  I'm on the phone with a 911, and this fucking dummy is, where are you now?  I said, I'm northbound on 47th Street on 10th Avenue.  Okay, you're on, now where are you now?  I said, 48th Street.  Where are you now?  49th Street.  And you said, it's heading which way, sir?  Northbound.  The only way you can go on 10th Avenue. 
[01:52:00]  We're so irritated with these dummies.  So we make the left on 57th Street.  We go down to 11th Avenue.  I go, look, he's making a left on 11th Avenue.  It's a yellow light, so the bus slows down and then shoots through the light and leaves  me at the red light.  I knew that the bus did that on purpose.  I'm like, this guy knows I'm behind him.  Now we're going southbound again.  So I call back.  No, I'm on the way.  It's an emergency.  So I just called, and no one is doing anything.  I'm following a stolen bus, I think.  No one is doing it.  How long does it take to get a squad car on fucking 11th Avenue?  So I pull up next to it, and it's really dark on the bus, and I just see some, there's  a black dude.  I'm on the phone. 
[01:52:30]  I'm like, I'm looking at the guy, and he's just a black dude, but he's not dressed like  a bus driver.  And I know that he's stealing this bus.  I'm northbound now, and he's behind me, and they're like, what street?  I'm like, now we're passing 40th Street.  The woman was like, where was he before?  10th and 11th, but then he came down 11th, and now we went up 10th.  He's probably going to turn it off because you're going to lose him.  Follow the fucking side.  So you keep saying 10th and 11th, but 10th and 11th are in parallel.  What street and 11th?  I know, he was on 10th, and then he went down 11th.  So then I was just like, fuck this shit, and I drive away, and he pulls away slowly and  starts to drive. 
[01:53:00]  And I'm like, you know what?  Forget it.  You know what?  Thank you.  He just turned it off.  He just turned it off.  Okay.  We lost him, and he probably turned into the bus depot.  What is this?  Oh, don't try to be our dream. 
[01:53:30]  Fucking Pepsi gave Beyonce a $50 million deal?  50 mil.  Jesus Christ.  Righteous bucks.  But is there any, like, is anyone going to drink fucking stupid Pepsi because of Beyonce?  Like, are people that dumb?  They care what celebrity soda is?  I guess they never look at it like that.  I think it's just, like, just shove Pepsi in people's faces.  Oh, imaging?  Yeah, it does strengthen the brand, probably, to have a giant celebrity.  Does it?  I mean, it helped Pepsi when Michael Jackson was their guy.  Yeah.  Britney Spears was the Pepsi girl.  Marty McFly. 
[01:54:00]  Marty McFly.  He liked Pepsi.  He always ordered it in the little diner, the malt shop.  And none of it makes Pepsi not suck.  Pepsi free.  Pepsi free.  Get a PayPal.  Well, that'll take a tab.  Can't have a tab.  No.  I like Pepsi.  Oh, Diet Pepsi is fucking horrendous.  Diet anything stinks.  Diet Coke is great soda.  No, it's not.  In a can?  You guys are fucking out of your minds.  It is Coke Zero.  I could drink Coke Zero.  I cannot drink Diet Coke Zilch. 
[01:54:30]  And Diet 7-Up might be passable.  There's something about a cola that's Diet that just doesn't fucking...  See, Diet Coke, I prefer to Coke.  Coke is too sugary and it makes my mouth dry.  Oh, I like my mouth dry.  But I can't drink regular Coke.  It fucking irritates me.  Yeah.  I'll have Diet Dr. Pepper if I'm at my aunt's house or something.  Will ya?  Why?  That bitch only have Diet Dr. Pepper?  That's right.  It tastes more like regular Dr. Pepper.  Yeah. 
[01:55:00]  I hate your aunt.  Are you a pepper?  I am a pepper.  Wouldn't you like to be a pepper too?  You don't remember that commercial because you're a little kid.  No, I know the ironic t-shirts that they sell now.  Yeah.  And I know what the reference is too.  But I certainly didn't see the commercial when it was on.  There's a guy from American Werewolf in London.  Right.  And he would dance around.  And he was also the drunk guy from the Seinfeld episode.  The alcoholic guy.  Oh.  That was him too.  And he'd dance around.  David Naughton.  And he'd go, drink Dr. Pepper.  And I'm proud. 
[01:55:30]  Oh, that's it.  Yeah.  I used to be alone in a crowd.  Ooh.  But now you look around these days.  Days.  There seems to be a Dr. Pepper craze.  Come on.  I'm a pepper.  He's a pepper.  She's a pepper.  We're a pepper.  Wouldn't you like to be a pepper too?  I need more.  I'm a pepper.  He's a pepper.  She's a pepper.  No.  If you drink Dr. Pepper, you're a pepper too.  Yeah.  I can't believe these were like real commercials at one point.  Dude.  It was insane.  This is how they advertise things.  The old commercials were like these song and dance numbers. 
[01:56:00]  There was a commercial for Coke.  That's one of the best commercials ever.  The Coke one?  One of the best commercials ever.  I mean, the song became a song that was on the fucking radio.  I'd like to give the world a Coke.  Yes.  The original version.  It was I'd like to teach the world to sing.  I'd like to teach the world to sing.  Why is this still playing?  I know.  Find the Coke song.  I want to just hear the Coke.  Oh.  I'd like to build the world a home and finish it with love and finish it with love. 
[01:56:30]  Oh, listen how groovy.  It is groovy.  There's a groove to it.  This is old school.  Very Christmassy.  Yeah?  Remind you of Christmas?  Is it the bells?  Yeah.  And it was a bunch of people in a field with like candlelight or some shit and they all  had little bottles of Coke.  What was this?  Like 71 or 71?  Is this the original, Eric?  Yeah.  I don't know.  Early 70s.  Like 70, 70.  Yeah.  This is like.  Coke is terrible for the world. 
[01:57:00]  It's just making people fat and diabetic.  They can't rhyme very easily to that.  So I guess they left that out of the song.  You'll have to call a medic.  You're fat and diabetic.  I'd like to chop off the world's left leg.  What is that?  Oh.  A news story?  Oh, okay.  Travis brought it in the seat of a news story.  Oh, I like a good news story to sink my teeth into. 
[01:57:30]  Good Morning America reports on prank phone calls in the radio business.  Oh, let's hear that.  Ah, yes.  Let's get into the whole debacle down in Ols' straw.  Seems the radio duo is off the air now.  Why wouldn't they be sure?  They did that little prank phone call.  They called the hospital that that bitch was in.  What the fuck's that name?  Yeah, exactly.  Kate Middleton.  Kate Middleton.  The duchess.  The duchess of what?  Cambridge. 
[01:58:00]  Cambridge.  Cambridge.  Uh, yeah.  And, uh, well, apparently the woman that put the call through to the nurse couldn't take  the pressure.  And offed herself.  And now, for some reason, that is the responsibility of the radio station and the radio personality.  Instead of concentrating on one of two things.  Either this woman's obvious depression, mental illness, and selfishness to leave her kids.  Or a culture that is so obsessed with not making mistakes that you commit suicide when you 
[01:58:30]  make an...  It was basically just an honest mistake.  Really dishonorable.  Well, it's English, but...  That's the problem.  It's the culture that doesn't allow a mistake without a...  You know...  And insulting the royal family.  In England, there are some people that just look at that royal family like fucking...  Royalty.  That is royalty, yes.  Like royalty.  Are you royalty?  Don't suck dicks.  Lawrence, that sounds like royalty.  I love the fact that he goes, are you royalty? 
[01:59:00]  Do you suck dicks?  Like, that's the next question.  Are you royalty?  Do you suck dicks?  You're either one or the other.  You're either a prince or a cocksucker.  Do you suck dicks?  Best question.  There's nobody I meet that I don't want to ask that to aggressively.  Oh, is that hilarious?  What a great interview question.  Yes.  So, you're on Homeland.  Yes, I am.  Ew, suck dicks!  What?  Yeah. 
[01:59:30]  Oh, shit.  Yeah, so, the woman killed herself, and they did an interview.  We heard it yesterday, an interview with the DJs, and boy were they busted up.  Yeah.  Boy, were they busted up.  A little fucking sad about the whole thing.  Then they pulled him off the air.  And now there's all kinds of news reports I'm hearing about what could possibly happen.  What are the repercussions?  Can they sue?  It's like, who's going to sue?  Do you think their intention, in any way, shape, or form, was to hurt anybody with a goofy call? 
[02:00:00]  They can sue.  You can always sue.  And I heard someone say something about wrongful death.  What?  I've heard, I've read that they didn't get the okay to air this.  Oh, wait a minute.  They said they got the okay.  Yeah.  They said it went through channels.  Maybe that's why they were saying that.  Oh, maybe.  Well, they're saying, you know, we tried to call the hospital five times to talk to somebody about airing this,  and then, for some reason, they just aired it anyway.  Oh, boy.  The hospital's saying nobody ever called us at all, or tried to. 
[02:00:30]  Oh, so maybe the station's doing damage control, and maybe these guys didn't really.  There's one point that was raised by the hospital, which, because I was like, what the fuck?  Why do they care?  But they raised, and I wish I could find it before we do this story,  because I thought it was a point that made me understand the hospital, at least their point of view.  Sorry, guys.  She's in hospital.  They don't say the hospital.  She's in hospital.  She's in hospital.  He's on holiday.  On holiday?  What does that even mean? 
[02:01:00]  Crazy English.  They're saying that.  I'm at university.  Yes, I'm on holiday.  And then you see, like, a woman singer laying there going, get off me.  She's just really holiday.  He.  They did not contact, the hospital said they did not contact senior management or its press office in advance, despite claims.  And they're saying they're extremely surprised by that statement.  And, you know, they said that, to be honest, no one here is really apportioning blame at the presenters.  They are clearly kids out of their depth.  But they're, and this is the hospital that made a good point here. 
[02:01:30]  They said, but there are serious questions to be asked of station management and about why they thought it appropriate to prank call a hospital where there are extremely sick people and to broadcast what were private medical details about one of its patients.  Oh, boy.  Like, when you look at it that way, it's like, all right, I understand why the hospital is pissed off.  Because that really, even though it's for us to fuck the royal family, it is private medical details about a patient.  Like, all right.  Yes.  That's actually a good point.  Well, the penis is going to be removed tomorrow. 
[02:02:00]  Imagine if the hospital is pranking him back.  Yes.  We're having a black cock tattoo taken off his buttocks.  So, what is the news doing?  Some kind of a radio pranks?  Some of the biggest prank calls.  Oh.  Well, back at 742, with more on the fallout from that royal hoax by Australian DJs, American shot jocks have been going over the line for years with outrageous stunts pulled live on the air. 
[02:02:30]  So, does this tragic episode mark the end of their funny biz?  ABC's Lizzie Davis has the story.  Oh, hello there.  Could I please speak to Kate, please, my granddaughter?  The Australian DJs who made this prank call have gone radio silent.  Their show now canceled, and the station announcing a company-wide suspension of prank calls after the nurse who initially answered their call later apparently committed suicide.  Right, it's B96.  Radio DJ Jay Nice on B96 in Chicago has a regular prank segment on his show. 
[02:03:00]  Oh, it doesn't.  Entertainers try to use real-life, everyday circumstances and try to find humor in it.  He says his station has no intentions of pulling the plug on prank calls, and they don't need to based on U.S. law.  Where such calls only become problematic, when it can be claimed it was foreseeable the act would cause damage or injury.  Hello, this is Sarah. How are you?  Sarah Palin was famously pranked while she was running for vice president by a notorious Montreal-based comedy duo pretending to be then-French president Nicolas Sarkozy. 
[02:03:30]  That's funny.  You know I see you as a president one day, you too.  Maybe in eight years.  A prank caller even managed to make his way through security to speak to Tony Blair while he was still prime minister.  Um, hello, Tony.  Yeah.  Hello, there, it's William Haig.  It's quite a good imitation.  But it was no laughing matter in 1998 when Opie and Anthony, DJs from a Boston radio station, were fired for telling listeners on April Fool's Day the mayor had died in a car accident. 
[02:04:00]  He was in a horrible car crash today.  While the Australian DJ's show has been terminated, it's not clear yet if they will be.  She's giving us real information.  The same joke they initially laughed at is now the reason for their tears.  Ah, they love it.  Oh, what a great piece.  Wow, that's a great piece you put together there. 
[02:04:30]  Oh, my God.  Boston radio duo.  Yes, Boston radio duo.  I was listening to that going, ooh, who are these guys?  Yeah, they sound fun.  They didn't mention it was no laughing matter, and after you got fired, you went on to the biggest success of your career.  Exactly.  And I got fired again.  Yes.  It was, but it was no laughing matter.  Why wasn't it?  Of course it was.  It was ridiculous.  It wasn't even an authentic, like, death.  I used to do mean prank calls.  Me and my buddy Tyler, I would just call Indian people out of the phone book. 
[02:05:00]  Oh, no.  But this is way before Star 69, and I would just go, like, the guy, I remember some guy's name was something Patel, and I'd be like, hey, is this Mr. Patel?  Yeah.  I'm going to get you, boy.  That was, I'm going to kill you.  Get out of town.  He would go, who is this?  Who's calling me?  And he would know I had his name from the phone book, so I'd say his name.  And I'm going, we don't need you around here, and we'll kill you.  It was like these things that could get you in so much trouble.  It's horrible.  Those are, like, threats based on, you know, race and things. 
[02:05:30]  I was really high and drunk one time, and I may have prank called my school and said there was a bomb somewhere.  Oh, my God.  Jimmy.  That's not a prank.  That's a bomb threat.  That's a bomb threat.  Yeah.  When does a prank become a bomb threat?  But I may have said something like, and if you think this is a joke, then start laughing.  And hung up.  While me and my stone friends were around giggling, and I heard they evacuated to school.  What's the statute of limitations on that?  That's, like, 1985.  Yeah, I think you're all right.  And, by the way, if you think this is a joke, then start laughing. 
[02:06:00]  Yeah, I think that was the line.  That's what a crazy person would say.  No, it doesn't mean anything.  No.  Like, instead of acting, laugh.  If you think that's a joke, start laughing.  I used to call all these fucking...  We would go to my buddy Scott's house, and I would get fucked up.  And I used to call, like, these, like, these, like, nuns that would help, like, wayward runaways.  And I would just always talk about being raped.  I was getting, like, raped and stuff, and I needed help.  But my prank calls weren't clever or funny.  They were just disgusting and mean.  Yeah. 
[02:06:30]  Aw.  Hi.  That's hilarious.  Hello?  I'm gonna kill you.  Click.  It was just threats.  Yeah, I was just a jerk.  You are a jerk.  By the time I called the bomb threat to the White House from the library.  What?  I was probably 12, 13 years old from the North Brunswick Public Library.  I might not have got through to the...  I think I just called the operator, and I told her to put me through to the White House.  Because I was gonna bomb us or something.  That's hilarious.  I was young. 
[02:07:00]  I didn't know it was bad.  I thought it would be a big laugh.  Oh, Jimmy.  What the hell was your thought process then?  I don't know.  Weren't even any jokes.  You were just calling up and threatening people.  Yeah.  Threatening their lives.  I wish I could remember all of them.  They were not clever.  Can you imagine what the operator thought when a 12-year-old kid was asking to be transferred  to the White House?  Give me the White House.  Come on.  Yeah, from the North Brunswick Public Library.  Fucking dork city.  I was simple with the prank calls. 
[02:07:30]  Like, just, you know, call up random numbers.  A lot of random...  When you didn't have to...  You know, there was a time...  Let me tell you a little more about history, young Sam.  There was a time where if you were calling a number in the same area code as yourself,  you did not have to dial the area code.  Really?  So if I'm calling a friend, I would just dial, you know, 261-5437, something like that,  instead of putting the area code in front. 
[02:08:00]  Well, I mean, now it's just, you just click the name.  Oh, right.  Or even it has phone numbers anymore.  This is true.  You just click the name in your phone book.  You just click the name in your phone.  Right.  But you used to have to, actually, yeah, you didn't have to dial in that.  So you could dial random calls very quickly for prank phone calls.  You could just dial seven numbers.  Right.  You'd use the first three from your neighborhood or some friend's neighborhood or something  like that, nearby, and then you'd just dial random four numbers.  And somebody would answer.  Yeah. 
[02:08:30]  But if you wanted to get creative, then you would look in the phone book, because then  you'd have the name and be able to, like you said, you know, you have his name.  Hello, Mrs. Johnson.  Why, yeah.  That's me.  Now you could get a little personal.  When I was a freshman in college, me and my buddy.  My buddy and I.  Oh, you're right.  Oh.  My buddy and I sat in my dorm room looking up people in the college directory with sitcom  last names.  Oh, shit.  And calling and asking for sitcom characters.  That's hilarious. 
[02:09:00]  And my phone ran out of battery, so he started using his phone, and then somebody filed a  harassment charge against him on his phone.  Because obviously, it's like 2002.  People have caller ID.  Oh.  He got in so much trouble.  I didn't take any blame.  Harassment charges?  Yeah, because you can't, you know, you can't look up, you can't look up the name Winslow,  and then call them up with a black woman's voice, and say, you're Harriet, where's Carl?  That's pretty good. 
[02:09:30]  You know?  That's a good one.  So.  Yeah, there was no Star 69.  People like back then would have to just hope that you stop calling.  Remember heavy breathing?  People would call and you just breathe.  Heavy breathing.  Oh, fuck you.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, fuck you.  That's so hopeless.  They would, the way you just said that, you just have to hope that they stopped calling.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I really hope this person stops pranking me.  Change your number?  I'll take, I'll take it off the hook for a while.  I'll take the phone off the hook, and then you'd do that, you'd have to get past the point 
[02:10:00]  where the dial tone, and then it would go, and then it would just go silent after a while.  But then you couldn't get phone calls from anyone else.  No, because there was no call waiting or anything.  No.  Nothing worse than, like, trying to call someone in the busy signal.  Remember the busy signal that would be, like, for an hour?  Yeah, yeah.  An hour and a half and you're like, oh, the guy's mom's on the phone.  An emergency breakthrough?  Do you remember emergency breakthroughs?  Yes.  High operator, could you get an emergency breakthrough?  You'd call for an emergency breakthrough. 
[02:10:30]  On the line.  The operator would say, so-and-so wants an emergency breakthrough.  Oh, wow.  It's like, who's on the fucking phone that long?  With the very beginning of, like, AOL, you used to call people's house and it'd be busy  for hours because they were on the internet.  Right.  Yeah.  14K.  I'm not talking about that.  No, this is way before, Sam.  I wasn't alive.  Moms used to spend so much time on the phone.  People's, like, my mom, I know my friend's moms, they were constantly on the phone for hours  on end.  Like, jabbering, like, broads.  Exactly.  Fucking jabbering broads.  Talking about nothing. 
[02:11:00]  I knew it was going to be, like, I wasn't going to be able to use, and you weren't able  to use the phone.  Like, if mom was on the phone, you had no contact with your friends.  You didn't know what was going on.  So it sucked when, you know, the phone would ring and my mom would pick it up and be like,  hello?  Hey!  How the hell are ya?  I'm like, oh, fuck.  This is going to be hours for a how the hell are ya.  And they didn't want anything.  It was just a long conversation.  They just would talk.  Now you only make a phone call if you have the specific purpose to, like, I need you 
[02:11:30]  to do something, or, you know, you needed me to do something.  Never just for conversation.  My friend Richie Jones used to call me every day in fourth grade.  Except he never wanted anything.  What a moe.  And I would always be like, okay, I gotta go.  And he'd be like, why do you have to go?  Yeah, well, he's fucking couple.  What a needy guy.  I just don't want to be on the phone anymore.  Oh, he's needy.  Yeah.  My mom didn't let me go to his house because he lived in a low-income, you know.  He was from Lower Stock.  Area, yeah.  Yeah.  Richie Jones.  I would talk to a couple of my buddies growing up, and you'd just spend hours on the phone. 
[02:12:00]  Like, it wasn't a girlfriend.  It was just you and your buddy yakking about nothing.  Just talk about nothing.  Falling asleep chatting.  You fell asleep chatting with your guy friends?  Just buddies, yeah.  He's talking to your friends.  Oh, my God.  Is it gay?  That's very gay.  That is kind of gay.  We're just talkative.  Falling asleep with your buddy.  But it wasn't a love thing.  Whispering sweet nothings in your ear.  No, no, no, no.  That's very, very gay.  So are you in bed now?  Yeah.  What are you doing?  What are you wearing?  Do you wear pajamas?  Touch yourself. 
[02:12:30]  It wasn't that type of talk.  Touch yourself.  Can I tell you something, Jim?  Yeah.  I don't wear anything when I sleep.  No, we never had that discussion right now, Jimmy.  I'm naked, Jimmy.  I'm going to fall asleep.  Yeah.  Although we're saying...  Are you asleep yet?  We're saying the guy, the gym is gay for talking to his friends and falling asleep.  This is the same guy who was blowing his friends when he was seven.  But I'm denying it.  No, it's not.  It's very manly.  I got in big trouble once with a girlfriend.  Oh.  Richard? 
[02:13:00]  Yes, Richard.  Richard Schepinski.  Yeah.  I was having a tiff with a girlfriend.  And back then, especially.  Boy, Anthony never got in tiffs with the girlfriends.  It was always girlfriend mad, Anthony crying, please stop, and apologizing to girls.  Really?  You were still in the crying phase.  Well, no, I wasn't really crying, but I was very sad.  Yeah.  I would never really get into it with a girlfriend, like yelling or even... 
[02:13:30]  Like, I would be like, yes, I'm wrong, please love me.  Because you wanted to be liked so bad, you were afraid if you fought back, she wouldn't like you anymore.  She was going to fucking ditch me and fuck my friends.  Oh, no.  That sounds terrible.  Which, to me, was like a fucking sentence worse than death.  The old girlfriend fucking your friends thing.  So, we were discussing this on the phone.  And I was laying down on the bed, talking on the phone.  And we were having a very in-depth discussion. 
[02:14:00]  And the next thing I remember, I woke up to a silent phone, like, hours later.  And I'm like, oh, no.  She's going to hate me.  And then I just, I didn't know.  I woke up at first, like, I didn't know what was going on.  I'm like, what?  Wait a minute.  I was...  Was I on the phone or something?  Oh, my God!  No!  He was talking!  Oh, shit!  I didn't finish the conversation!  She must have...  And I'm just picturing her going, hello!  Hello!  Like, I played the silent game with her. 
[02:14:30]  And back then, you can't...  You have to wait until the next day for closure.  It was pretty much...  Well, I had...  No, you can't just text her.  I had to call her back.  And...  Wasn't it late?  It wasn't that late.  Oh, okay.  But, yeah, it was like...  What happened?  It was like 8 o'clock.  She was so mad.  She was yelling at me that I...  How dare I fall asleep in the middle of such an important conversation?  Oh, was she pissed.  I'm sorry.  Oh, no, sweetie.  I'm sorry.  Were you always, like, groveling, apologizing? 
[02:15:00]  Yes!  Did it work out?  No!  She fucked my friend!  I swear!  Fucking cunt.  She fucking went off with Frank.  I'll never fall asleep on the phone with you.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, yeah, you fucker.  Justin Stengel just texted me and said when he was in high school, a heavy breather called  and his mom answered.  And his dad was traveling.  So his mom thought it was his dad just messing around. 
[02:15:30]  And she was talking to him for five minutes while he was jerking off.  And then she remembered his dad was on the plane, so she hung up immediately.  So she's just talking to him.  He's jerking off.  And she's like, oh, shit, his plane hasn't landed.  Let me break Justin's fucking bubble.  What happened was, his mother was having phone sex.  And when Justin walked in and said, mommy, who are you talking to?  She went, oh, it's your father.  She built that excuse.  Yes. 
[02:16:00]  What she was doing was, she probably was standing by the counter and she had a fucking roller.  And as she was talking, she was probably grinding her cunt into the roller.  Oh, my God.  No, I mean, with pants on.  Oh, no, I'll do respect you.  I love Justin.  But she was probably grinding her crotch, I should say, into the end of the fucking,  what do you call it?  Is that what he called the roller?  The rolling pin.  I bet you she was just grinding her fucking clit and groin, talking to this stranger.  Her favorite book was A Stranger Calls Me. 
[02:16:30]  She would read it and she had it dog-eared for all the sexy parts.  Oh, I'm reading A Stranger Calls Me.  And then she would rub kitchen utensils on herself?  On her vagina, yeah.  You think they use the rolling pin women?  Yeah, or the ice cream scooper.  Like, if she was at the table, she would probably use the bottom side of the ice cream scooper over her slacks.  While the stangles were eating soup.  I'm sorry, Justin.  The whole stangle family.  Yeah, they had no idea.  Like, where's the ice cream scooper?  And then mom would sheepishly pull it off from under the table. 
[02:17:00]  We want dessert.  Yeah.  I bet a woman wearing tight pants would like a nice whisk.  You take the whisk and just, in your lap.  Like you're whisking eggs to scramble them.  Whip it up some butter.  Yes.  And you hand it to your boy and he licks the beaters.  Licks the egg beaters.  There's a fucking hair on it.  And leg sweat.  Like a thick meringue.  Oh, that's wonderful. 
[02:17:30]  You never want to think about your mom talking a guy through a jerk.  No.  She was fucking talking a guy through a jerk.  He was jacking off.  Oh, no.  Yeah, anything.  It was very difficult to get a good jerk in when you lived at home like that.  Not just because it was hard to get time alone, but you never wanted to equate what you were  doing with the rest of your family, you know?  Like, it's always like, oh, mom's got to do my laundry.  So, you know, where's the jizz going? 
[02:18:00]  It's going in the sheet or somewhere.  I don't know.  Or you're jerking off in your room and like, she's got to go in there and clean.  It's just a weird situation with that.  And then I used to steal her Cosmo magazines.  I used to steal her Cosmo to jack off to it.  Cosmo tells all in the back.  And it was always a nude shot.  Really?  Yeah.  Some nude picture.  Some of them were kind of like blurry, but other ones were like, yeah, it's a nude shot.  Do you miss the days when you could just jerk off to a naked lady in Cosmo? 
[02:18:30]  Oh, my God.  How nice is that?  Yes.  We were so less desensitized back then.  Oh, you could just fucking, anything, anything would be fucking stiff as a board right there.  Any picture.  Even reading Penthouse Forum.  You're just reading Penthouse Forum.  Imagining it in your mind.  Now you need fucking three people, a donkey.  Yeah.  What kinds of shit going on?  It's terrible.  When I used to steal magazines, whether it was Wii or Penthouse, Playboy was always corny. 
[02:19:00]  You know, steal them out of the fucking machine, the vending machine.  Wii was good.  But a good ass shot would make me fucking crazy.  I could come to that in a second.  Yes.  And then now you just get older and you get jaded and it doesn't do it anymore.  You've just seen so much shit to jack off to something.  Boy, do you need a virtual three ring circus of porno.  Yeah.  It's not exactly a treat to find something now.  No.  Easy.  Easy.  You've got a fucking computer keyboard set up like Emerson Lake and Palmer all around you. 
[02:19:30]  You're fucking working the mouse, the fucking touchpad, you dick.  You're just trying to find something.  No, I'm going to come to that.  Wait, no, I'll get something better.  I know there's something better just around the corner.  Five hours later, you're still edging.  Penthouse Forum just looks like a blog now.  Like you can just read everything.  Oh, look at that.  It's hard to, you know, no one's going to go out and buy that when there's so much.  Penthouse Forum, George. 
[02:20:00]  You can go to like these big sites now that are these super sites of stories.  I'll take the sites.  Yeah.  Meanwhile, I'm trying to jerk off and I forgot I got the soup.  Yeah.  Yeah, being able to read something like that.  Like Penthouse Forum was fucking hot when I was younger and would read that.  Great.  Great shit.  I loved it.  They're all real.  Turn my pod to it.  No.  No, all these stories.  Oh, all right.  Yeah, I mean, nobody's going to write them in if they're not. 
[02:20:30]  Yeah, true.  But there was the worst when you get a magazine fiction.  An issue that had no good stuff in it.  But sometimes you would just get one and there was nothing good, like no good seduction stories.  Yeah.  I liked a good seduction story.  You'd need like, yeah, like some, oh, what is this?  Yeah.  Oh, what are you doing?  Yeah.  Oh, I never liked the bondage ones.  They stink.  Yeah.  She parted her legs and I could see her underpants. 
[02:21:00]  Not a fan of the bondage.  Even now?  No.  Oh, bondage stories do nothing for me.  I don't get it.  Nothing.  Unexpected encounters.  What?  I don't get it, the bondage.  Like, I, I, there's some people like the idea of the tying and tickling's a weird one that does nothing for me.  Tickling?  Oh, yeah.  Tickling's a big fetish.  It must be that.  It must be the helplessness.  Sounds stupid.  Can I ask if anybody out there would call in that has experienced a tickling fetish?  And don't just heavy breathe on the phone.  We want to talk.  Yeah.  Yeah, but I'm serious.  Tickling's funny. 
[02:21:30]  Some people like it.  I don't get it.  It's not sexy.  I've seen it in video a little bit.  I don't think I've ever known anybody who was into it, but I've just, it's just weird to me.  Dr. Steve checking in.  I, uh, I, uh, I used to beat off to Betty and Veronica in the Archie comics if nothing else was around.  Oh, yuck.  So much for the good old days.  Yeah, now he's, now it's fucking, he's lying.  It was probably, he wanted to be in a threesome with Jughead and Big Ethel.  Like he would dream that Jughead would make, would make him wear the crown while he sucked Jughead's cock and Big Ethel fucked him with a strap on. 
[02:22:00]  And then they could hear the Archie's band rehearsal through the wall.  Ah.  Yeah.  Ah-yah.  Ah-yah.  Yeah, it's good to be, where's Mr. Lodge?  I have a fetish for older gentlemen.  I want Mr. Lodge to come in my face.  He wanted Mr. Lodge.  He wanted Mr. Lodge to fuck his shitter.  He says, thank God for the internet.  Yes.  The internet changed everything.  When we used to watch those, you old enough, Sam, to remember the scrolling pictures? 
[02:22:30]  Yes.  Where you get AOL and, bing, you've got mail.  They're like, ooh, someone sent me one.  And you download it, it would take forever to download one picture.  I used to go into chat rooms and try to trade with people, but I wouldn't have anything, so I would just rip them off all the time.  I did that too.  You would too, right?  You sent first.  Okay, set at the same time.  Fuck an asshole.  Goodbye.  Do those chat rooms exist anymore in AOL or no? 
[02:23:00]  Not really.  Are there AOL chat rooms?  Who would fucking go there?  AOL was like internet training wheels.  That's what it was.  It was like, let's get everyone kind of into this to know what it's all about.  And then after a while you realize, wait a minute, if I'm hooked up to the internet, I can go and browse websites by myself?  Nobody knew what a browser was.  I don't need to stay in AOL.  I forget.  I was looking at something.  It might have been like a movie cover.  I don't remember what it was, but it had the old AOL keyword. 
[02:23:30]  Remember before anybody had a website?  Yes.  All the big companies had an AOL keyword.  AOL keyword.  Yeah.  AOL keyword.  Because they all had.  Sony.  They all had AOL pages.  Because you used to have to click through the AOL pages.  Yes.  And it was, I remember when I first started coming on the show, I would go to like AOL profiles and stuff.  Yeah.  And I would like search Opie and Anthony.  And whoever had like a girl that had Opie and Anthony in her profile, I would try to talk to.  Oh, man.  Hi, I'm Desperate Jim.  Oh, that's hilarious.  What a great way to get some chicks. 
[02:24:00]  I don't know if I ever.  Did you ever score?  No.  But look at how in that last 10 years, how fucking different it is, man.  It's amazing.  Totally.  I really don't watch my TV anymore.  I never thought that.  If the iPad didn't have such cocksucker, typical pussy Mac volume, I would watch the iPad.  I watch all, like the whole fucking Warwick Empire watch on the iPad.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You could absolutely do that.  Looks great.  You pop in your earphones, Jimmy.  It's not even loud.  Really?  On a plane, Mac volume is so shitty with the iPad. 
[02:24:30]  Even on a plane, when I have Bose earphones and I can't hear it because of the engine noise.  It can't compete with the jet engine.  Yeah.  It's annoying to me that they do that.  Yeah.  They want you to buy external speakers.  Yeah, absolutely.  I used to go to AOL, go in those rooms and trade shit on my brother's computer.  It's like, fuck him, let him get in trouble.  I was 12.  So I used to...  You could have taken pictures of yourself and just sent them.  Now I know I could have made money. 
[02:25:00]  But no, I used to get kicked off AOL all the time and they would call my dad because I  always got terms of service warnings for pretending to be wrestlers.  What a jerk.  Oh my God.  You have the worst rebel story.  I know.  That's terrible.  Who would you try to be?  Goldust.  Were you ever Bob Backlund?  No.  And you were doing the knee walk around the AOL chat room?  No, I'd pretend I was Goldust.  What would you do?  Because my screen name was GDust1.  And my profile, I filled out my profile and it said like name, Dustin. 
[02:25:30]  And I filled it out with like just things that alluding to me being Goldust.  Oh my God.  How did they find out?  Well, the minute that you say that you are him, somebody can just copy the conversation  and send it to terms of service.  Why would they do that though?  Who cares?  They always, I always got busted.  It's a bunch of rats running around there.  They would actually call, huh?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I got kicked off AOL twice.  I think I had two strikes.  Wow.  Because they're pretending to be Goldust.  Not for downloading porn. 
[02:26:00]  No, no.  What would you say is Goldust though?  I would just be, I would keep answering things like, they'd be like, are you really Goldust?  Maybe.  Why do you ask?  Oh God.  And then eventually I'd be like, yes, I am.  Yeah, I am.  Do you really hate Razor Ramon?  Yeah, I can't stay on the guy.  Yeah, blah, blah, blah.  You think Sam got off to us?  Yeah, I'm gay.  I'm the gayest.  Sam's an idiot.  Embarrassing.  So what, are you looking at chat rooms?  There were the rooms that used to just say like GIFs and you'd go in there.  Oh yeah.  You know, that's where you traded. 
[02:26:30]  Yeah, you can still do chat rooms.  You got to download AIM and I guess people are still on AIM.  I have AIM.  That's crazy.  I'm sure I have one too.  I mean, I would have to remember my.  I don't really use it, but I have it.  Do people still on AOL?  I'm going to, I have an AOL account.  I still have yellow treats, but I don't use it anymore.  Because I have some emails from years ago that I saved, but I got to go back through.  I'm going to dump my AOL, I think.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They're cocksuckers.  I got hacked and they wouldn't help me unhack until I paid for the service because it was  far as getting it for free.  Wow.  They're such scumbags. 
[02:27:00]  What?  AOL are scumbags.  I'm really glad they're taking a beating.  Isn't it free now?  I mean, obviously you don't pay for it.  It has to be.  They're not doing anything.  There's no reason to.  I remember people like, wait a minute, what do you, what, what do you want?  AOL?  I go, no, I just have a, I have Roadrunner service, you know, high speed internet.  It's, it's hooked up all the time.  You don't even have to dial up.  What?  What?  Because, but how do you like see stuff without AOL?  I go, no, you just got to pop open a browser.  You pop open Netscape.  A what?  Netscrape.  And it's great. 
[02:27:30]  What?  But then where does it go?  How do you get your mail?  What do you do?  It was weird when you left the fucking AOL compound.  But then you had to get like Hotmail or Yahoo mail.  Yes.  I had ExciteMail.  I got Yahoo.  Is Hotmail still used?  It is, right?  Yeah.  A lot of people still use Hotmail for some reason.  Yeah.  Gmail's big though.  Gmail's the best.  Gmail's, yeah.  Yeah.  It's the biggest.  Yeah, you're still.  I'm Yahoo and I'm also me.  Oh, yeah.  What's that mean?  From Mac?  I will never use iCloud. 
[02:28:00]  But now it's iCloud.  Now it's at iCloud.  They're fucking horrible.  What was the last one before this that they did that was automatic syncing?  It was like two or three years ago.  Yes.  What was it called?  I would lose phone numbers all the time.  It would wipe out like a month's worth of phone numbers.  I fucking hated it.  Yeah, it was the cloud.  It would sync three and four times the same numbers.  It was so enraging.  i-something.  iLife?  Was it iLife?  No.  iLife?  No, but I'll never use them again.  People can hack your text messages. 
[02:28:30]  If you program it for your text messages to be saved through iCloud, people can hack that.  So stupid.  I know with backing up shit, it's pretty fucking easy.  I back it up.  I know, because you got a new phone, and it just pulls the shit off of the cloud.  Yeah.  It comes from the clouds.  You don't need that.  It's backing up through iTunes.  You don't have to plug in anything.  You know what I don't like about that that I can never figure out?  You plug some shit in.  You want to sync something.  You want to back up your phone.  And then it's like, all this will be erased.  All this. 
[02:29:00]  If you continue with sync, this will be gone.  Like, I don't want anything to be gone.  I hate calendar conflicts.  Yes.  No, stop it.  Inadvertently.  I never know what fucking calendar conflicts are, which one I should side with.  Do you want to resolve this now?  No.  Some other day, I'll have a big calendar conflict party and have my friends over.  Certain contacts I have, it's listed four times.  My Jesus Christ.  You sync it up.  It's like, do you?  And it asks you if you want to, like, erase stuff. 
[02:29:30]  It's like, you know, it'll be eliminated from this computer.  Or if you sync with this, it's like, why can't I just fucking, don't give me any warnings  that I'm going to lose some shit.  You know?  Yeah.  Like, but that's the idea of sync is like, it replaces everything.  Yeah.  You can't just be like, I just want what's on there, on here.  Right.  And then with everything else.  Yeah.  You want everything.  Right.  No.  Exactly.  There's some, I don't know.  I got some ideas.  You do?  Yeah.  About what?  Some ideas.  J'ai une idée.  Like apps and stuff.  I remember that from French, when I took French fucking thing. 
[02:30:00]  J'ai une idée.  What's your idea?  Like, I have an idea or something.  Oh.  It was when I had summer school for French.  We had to do like a little play.  Yeah.  Ja.  Wait.  Mamon, Jacques me en saute.  Mom, Jacques insulted me.  Oh.  Mamon.  Sorry, guys.  Jacques insulte me?  I take the bus to summer school for France, for French.  You took summer school?  For high school French.  For high school French, you had to go to summer school?  So I could graduate or I could get, yeah, or so I could move on to the next grade.  I graduated in summer school. 
[02:30:30]  Oh.  No, no.  I didn't graduate.  Oh, I did.  It was just to get to senior year.  Oh, I did.  Mamon.  Jacques me en saute.  Wow.  Sorry.  You got a good inflection there, too.  Thank you.  That must sound horrific to a French person.  I'm sorry.  What were you saying?  Oh, no.  For like certain apps.  Uh, I was looking for one.  You ever, uh, you ever texting, uh, and sometimes you inadvertently text the wrong person? 
[02:31:00]  Something like that?  Yeah.  Isn't there a button that you could do, like, that will have, say, like, are you sure you  want to send this text?  And you could program it to various, um, like, contacts?  I'm sure there will be that.  It should be that.  Right?  So that way you type the text in, and then you hit the button, and then, you know, if  you're maybe your girlfriend or something, you don't want to fucking, you know, send  something inadvertently to her.  I went and sent a text that said, good morning, sweetie, to one of the publicists at WWE.  Uh-huh.  Who's meant for Jess.  But how did you do that?  I've done that a couple of times, but considering the odds of doing that are so astronomically low. 
[02:31:30]  I don't know.  I've sent, how are you doing, sweetie, to, um, Ange.  And Ange's like, uh, well, not too bad.  I'm here at your house.  Didn't you send, uh, didn't you send Than, uh, a text, like, years ago?  Yeah, yeah.  That was meant, that was meant for, uh.  I think I was sexting Than.  Oh, my God, I did do that.  Yeah?  To Bob Saget.  No way.  It's one of.  Did you misread faggot, and you were going to send it to him? 
[02:32:00]  Yeah.  I thought it was you.  No, I was.  Dude, I, and Saget told the story in Montreal this year when he brought me on.  I was sending it to a girl, and she would massage me, and she would go, I would go, like,  can I, I really could use a hand, which was meaning she was going to come over, and she  had a fat pussy, she was sexy, and she was going to jerk me off.  Oh, man.  But that was our weird little code word.  Saget would have done that, too, though.  But I, yeah, he probably would have.  But I sent it to Bob Saget, and I'm like, oh, God, I meant that for a girl.  Oh, man.  What did he say?  He laughed.  He must have thought it was hilarious.  Yeah, that's one of his favorite stories. 
[02:32:30]  Yeah, yeah.  It all depends on who gets it.  But let's say you got your girlfriend, or you got a multitude of, like, three chicks  or something in your phone.  You program the app, or whatever it is, to those three names.  So not everybody, you don't have to verify for everybody, but just those names.  Are you sure you want to send this to Sam 5087?  It's like, yeah, and it gives you a heads up, and then you can hit yes.  There is an app for that, actually.  I've never seen it.  I'm creating it.  Well, it would be a great one. 
[02:33:00]  No, I looked.  Believe me.  There's Ask to Send, but that's on jailbroken phones.  Yeah, yeah.  That's what I'm reading.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, why don't they have that?  Great idea.  Someone make it.  I mean, companies like PayPal have it.  Like, when I send money through the PayPal app, it'll say, like, are you sure you want  to send?  Yes.  And I will say, yes, I am.  Why would you ask me that?  I'm doing this.  What are you Paypalling?  That's crazy.  My wife.  Oh, sweet.  Why?  Because I would do it for free of you.  She's your wife, Travis. 
[02:33:30]  Do you know how much I'd love that marriage if she charged me every time?  Oh, that'd be great.  I would have so much respect for both of you.  That'd be great.  Charge them.  PayPal's great, though.  Yeah, it is.  You get a PayPal, like, debit card, and, you know.  It really has come a long way as far as paying for shit online.  I don't use it for my bank account, though.  Like, you have to set that up.  But the way I use it is through a credit card.  So I have a statement every month, and I know exactly what I send out.  I use it rarely, like online banking, but I hate America. 
[02:34:00]  I mean, Bank of America so much, like, I try to use other methods.  I just work bored myself.  Bank of America, let's, yes, I understand.  I don't like using my bank account for anything online.  I don't do that.  No?  Use credit card.  Yeah.  But I'm sure, I mean, what could they possibly do?  Well, banks are pretty good with, because everything is so easy to track now.  Yeah.  Banks, credit cards, they're all pretty good.  If you have a good history with them of giving your money back, like, I'm not worried about 
[02:34:30]  my bank account being raided and all of a sudden, they, I just, I know I didn't do  it.  I can defend that.  Yeah.  And there's not so much in it, either.  Aw.  Most of my money is tied up in investments.  Is it?  Look at you.  Tied up.  Tied up in investments.  I have a pittance here and a pittance there.  Braggard.  How's it doing this year?  Do you get your statements and look at them?  I look at them.  I look at my statements online.  Yes.  Fucking, every week I go online, I'm, my fucking accountant told me, he goes, uh, Jim, you'll,  uh, you'll watch your money better than anybody I work with. 
[02:35:00]  Oh, Irish gentleman.  Yes, he is.  He's Irish.  Hey, Jim, keep your eye out of your money, buddy.  Hey.  But I do, I fucking pay attention, man, because guys get ripped off by their accounts.  Oh, it's crazy.  Business managers, everything has to go through me.  I'm never, I'm not saying never, but I'm going to be very fucking hard to steal from.  Those are crazy stories.  Billy Joel got fucking railed for a shitload of money.  By his brother-in-law, right?  We know the Dane Cook story.  Yeah, but Dane, Dane's guy was stealing physically, I think. 
[02:35:30]  Was it?  Like cash?  Yeah.  Like fucking taking big stacks of money.  And forgeries, I think.  Like, that's stuff that's hard to avoid.  Wow.  Because if somebody's forging shit, but you never give anybody else access like that.  Yeah.  Never.  No.  Everything, and no one has any power of, they have power of attorney on one account,  but I have to sign up for it for them to pull taxes out, but I have to approve it every  time they do it.  And they'll say, is it okay to do it for this?  And it's just easier.  Yeah, I always get that thing.  You've got to sign this sheet so we can do this. 
[02:36:00]  I'm like, oh, okay, you know.  But it's like every few months I get one of those sheets.  But it's better than just giving them carte blanche to stamp your name on shit, you know?  No way.  You never want that.  But I think being a radio guy or being a comic, it's like you don't deal as much with residuals.  Like musicians get so ripped off because they make so much money and then they have foreign  distribution.  And hey, your thing was used in a commercial here and they sampled it here.  There's like so many, publishing rights.  There's so many ways to get ripped off for these guys. 
[02:36:30]  Yeah, so many ways to steal this.  Yeah, because it's hard to keep an eye on everything.  Yeah, you've got to have somebody who really...  Like I trust the guys.  Like, you know, Kenny I trust implicitly.  He doesn't do that stuff for me.  He's too stupid to steal.  No, boy, Kenny could be fucking everybody.  Watch somebody they arrest Kenny and he's got just a pile of gold from everybody.  But Kenny I trust with money.  I think Kenny is very honest because he worked with Dice and he handled a lot more cash than  I'll ever have.  And he's an honest guy.  Kenny's not a thief.  Yeah.  I trust Jonathan and Pete with my money. 
[02:37:00]  Bob Eatman I trust financially.  I don't think Bob's a thief.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Because he's dealing with Opie and Anthony money.  So he would probably steal from them first because they make so much more.  I've dealt with Bob for so many years.  It would be a great surprise, let's just say, if he was pulling any shenanigans.  And Barry, our accountant also.  Yeah, and I get the statements too.  Yeah, look at them.  Oh, look at that.  We're doing a financial break.  It's good.  This is our financial break.  What are the futures looking like this morning?  What are the Dow futures?  Well, I want to know what oranges are going to be like this year. 
[02:37:30]  Oh.  So I'm doing a secret deal in a garage.  Trading places.  The orange crop.  Yes.  How ridiculous is that storyline?  Mr. Beaks.  That's it.  Mr. Beaks.  Clarence Beaks.  Clarence Beaks.  I have to tinkle.  That would take a little break.  I like to call it break-a-rooney.  Oh, that's fucking cool.  It's hilarious, right?  Fuck, yeah.  Anything a-rooney is good.  I know.  And we'll be right back-a-rooney.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Coming up on an all-new O&A Behind the Laughter, comedian Jim Norton opens up about his pride 
[02:38:00]  life.  So I'm on my stomach, and I guess maybe a little goes in, and it's really hurting.  I'm like, yeah, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.  And the work that goes into creating a great joke.  And I just have to keep stopping.  Stop, stop, stop, stop.  And she's like, just relax.  You're tensing up.  I'm like, of course I am.  Trying to fuck me in the butt.  How does a famous comedian hone his craft?  She's getting annoyed at me.  She's like, just relax.  And I'm like, I'm trying to relax. 
[02:38:30]  And then a little bit of it going, stop, stop, stop, stop.  I have to shit, I have to shit, I have to shit, I have to shit.  Jim Norton opens his heart.  I'm going to shit, I'm going to shit, I'm going to shit.  And his sphincter.  And then she stopped, and I ran into the bathroom because I had farts.  And we all know farts equal funny.  And I fucking push out like.  Hysterical laughter and soiled bedsheets.  I kept saying, how much is in?  She's like, that much?  When we go behind the laughter with comedian Jim Norton.  Open Anthony's Phone Slam with Club Soda Getty. 
[02:39:00]  Hi, is this Ray?  Yeah.  Ray, your family's dead.  What?  Remember that faulty propane tank in your backyard?  No.  Well, it blew the house up.  What?  They're all dead.  Oh my God.  You've just been phone slammed.  Who is this?  Goodbye.  Sirius XM.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[02:39:30]  Right.  Right.  Green Day is so fucking cutting edge punk.  Great stuff.  I realize bands that were really big in the 90s, and even into the 2000s, kind of dropping 
[02:40:00]  off really quickly.  But not really, not too much longevity into that new part of the 1000s.  No.  Now it's all about all these bands.  I don't even know who they are.  I look at the MTV.  I'm like, who are these bands on the MTV?  There are no bands on the MTV.  Yes, there are.  They play them in fucking 20 second clips at the end of their programming.  In the credits?  In the credits. 
[02:40:30]  They play their bands.  It's always some dumb looking hipster chick and some guy with a big beard playing some  music I could give a shit about.  You don't like a lot of the new music?  I don't like the new music.  I like the Gangnam Style.  I like that too.  I like the Gangnam Style.  Gangnam Style.  Oh.  Is everyone officially totally fucking sick of this song?  Yes.  Fuck no.  What?  Oh my God.  I'm doing my own version of it.  What are you doing, Chip?  Chippy Style. 
[02:41:00]  Chippy Style?  What's the gimmick?  Do you dance around like the girls in this?  Just like that, yeah.  That didn't look like a...  Yeah.  I could be very sick.  Yeah, sexy Satan.  What?  What is it, like a metal version?  Fuck yeah.  Oh, wow.  Let's do it, Chippy Style.  That sounds great.  Oh, you know, you must be worried about offending people.  I don't give a fuck.  Wow.  No, he don't give a fuck.  Chip don't care.  Wow.  Chip don't give a shit.  Do you think that would be a hit?  No.  Of course not.  He don't give a shit. 
[02:41:30]  Not even as a parody.  We need a girl in here.  We have not had a fucking girl in this studio in how long?  No.  It's been a while.  When's the last time we had a fucking chicken here?  We need a chicken.  Sick of male energy.  Oh, a chick in here.  Oh, I thought it was a chicken.  Like a month or two ago?  Who?  A month or two.  We had those three playboy girls.  Yeah, but...  I think Roland's working on some girls for next week, actually.  Like right now.  Right now?  Yeah.  Grab some brought off the street.  No, but we just literally have no fucking sexy energy in here ever.  Oh, sexy.  And you want like a regular girl? 
[02:42:00]  But a kid...  Or a fucking...  Any chick.  How about anything with a vagina?  We never have that.  If you want to look back at the old days on OA Photos, there's a gallery with Jimmy and  Gina Lynn and a few other girls who wanted to be lesbians for the day.  I remember that.  That was...  I didn't know that was Gina Lynn where I'm sniffing her ass.  There's that great picture of me sniffing.  It's right in there.  I put the gallery right last night.  God, I remember that sniff.  Yeah.  You making that face?  Sniffy face. 
[02:42:30]  Sniffy face.  Yeah, I didn't realize that that was 2000, man.  Gina Lynn has been around for a while.  Man.  What the fuck?  I have a 12 years.  I've been striking out.  Oh, wow.  That was so long, though.  I wish I wasn't in a relationship at the...  Like, you don't want to interview porn stars all the time because it gets annoying and  it gets...  Well, yeah.  But once in a while, how about it?  I wouldn't even...  Oh, there go the curtains.  It's like, you're not even showing anything.  Oh, whatever.  Oh, God, Sal.  It's because Sal's offended.  Yeah, yucky. 
[02:43:00]  Yeah, Sal personally doesn't like looking at girls.  Whenever he sees a pussy, he just yells, where is it?  What's going on there?  Look at this.  Oh, my God.  Look at the pictures of just nude chicks.  So immature.  Look at that.  Wow, four asses lined up in thongs.  That's great.  We're just looking at old 2000 pictures from N.E.W.  Yeah.  Oh, look at that.  They're showing their pussies.  Who is this one?  I don't know.  God, I like vaginas.  That's amazing.  I don't see enough of them.  Do you know how long it's been since I've seen a vagina in person?  Really? 
[02:43:30]  Yes.  How long, Jimmy?  While.  Really?  Yes.  Oh, God.  Who's showing me?  Fucking nobody is showing me their vagina.  Don't you, like, go out on dates or something?  Do I?  No.  If I go out to eat, nothing happens.  Not even a kiss.  Really?  No.  You don't get them back to your pad?  Oh, God.  Just a string of fucking duds.  Really?  Oh, I should be the mayor of Dud City.  Of Strikeout City. 
[02:44:00]  Dud City?  What do you think you're doing wrong?  I cannot find anyone interested in me.  Literally.  It's been strikeout after strikeout after strikeout.  They're going out with you.  That's, like, at least means something.  Nah, but I mean, like, I meet people weird, man.  I can't find just a regular girl to go out who I kind of want to...  Everyone I meet has a boyfriend or a fucking cunty husband.  This is why you...  Oh, then you don't even fucking deal with them.  You dummies in your 30s.  That's why I don't like you, because you're all taken.  You throw them to the wayside. 
[02:44:30]  No.  And don't even return their fucking calls.  Or anything.  I don't know where to go to meet them.  Wow, she's pretty.  There's some pretty girls there.  I remember those.  Those four are hot.  Look at those asses lined up.  Yeah, I used to always be the one...  Because you and Opie were in relationships,  so I'd be the one that got the lap dances and stuff.  God, yes.  I loved it.  I loved that open-air was fucking couldn't do anything,  and I would just get my cock rubbed on.  I should have just been fucking everything.  Yeah, you kind of should have been.  Doing.  Look at that fucking nice big vag hanging down.  And so, yeah, we need some sexy energy in here.  Every time a chick comes in, 
[02:45:00]  we don't have to beat him up and challenge him.  Why don't we just talk to a fucking chick when she comes in?  I love just talking to pretty girls.  Yeah.  Next week, all right.  I get all smitten.  You did get to see Stalker Patty's vagina a couple weeks ago.  Oh, yeah.  That was two weeks ago.  What are you complaining about?  Look at the second one in from the left, dude,  with the dark hair.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  She probably doesn't look that good anymore, though.  Oh, you don't think so?  Twelve years later?  Those big tits hanging down?  Those look real.  And then who's that third one in?  Is that Gina Lind?  No. 
[02:45:30]  Oh, Gina's on the end.  Who is she?  She looks familiar.  Gina looks good, too.  Is it the blonde?  Yeah.  You called her Hot Wax Shannon?  Oh, I remember the name.  Oh, right.  What were their other names, Yrock?  What were their names?  There were no other names.  Becca Tetley.  Becca?  Yes.  Helen Myrtletrsk.  You love the name Helen.  Helen Myrtletrsk.  It's a terrible name.  How do you say that?  Imagine that.  It has a couple letters with the double ots over them.  What are the double dots called?  The umlauts.  The umlauts.  The umlauts. 
[02:46:00]  Helen Myrtletrsk is dancing tonight.  Myrtletrsk.  Yeah, but we need that.  Like, even if they're not eating each other's assholes, how about we get them in just to talk  to them and talk about their pussies?  Oh.  There is a fucking model for this bra that is on TV.  She's the hottest fucking thing in the world.  Is she in tomorrow?  Her name is Nina...  Let's see.  Pinta Santa Maria?  Oh.  Yes.  Nina Pinta Santa Maria. 
[02:46:30]  Um, just put Nina model, whatever.  It's a ship.  What's her name?  Blackwell?  Nina.  No.  Nina.  No.  No, not Nina Beardsley.  No.  Nina 99 Love Belongs.  No.  Nina Beardsley.  Nina Beardsley.  No.  Won't you have model my bra?  That could be her.  What's her name?  Yes, yes.  Put her name in fucking Google Images.  What am I, Sam? 
[02:47:00]  I know what you're saying.  Yes.  You don't know what you're saying.  You're Sam.  You're taking forever over there, apparently.  That's true.  Look at this fucking...  Now find...  Go down and...  I don't know.  Find some fucking picture of her.  Her full body.  Look at this chick.  Dude, look at her!  Yeah, she's fucking pretty, man.  Holy shit.  I wouldn't mind smooching with her.  Oh, my God.  I'd kiss her.  She doesn't...  Let me see the top left one.  The left one with her long neck.  She's a long...  Oh, my God.  She has a nice kissable neck.  Like, I would want to go out with Nina and go to dinner or something.  Yeah, right?  No, one below that.  What's her name?  Nina... 
[02:47:30]  She's a very pretty girl.  Nina Agdal?  Agdal.  A-G-D-A-L?  Agdal.  I wouldn't mind kissing her.  Holy shit.  Sit on my lap.  Check her out.  I want to be her guy friend.  Hey, if you ever need to talk...  Why don't you tweet her?  A real relationship.  Oh, she's got a tweeter.  How many people are following her?  301.  Oh, no.  I'm sorry.  16,000.  That's it?  She's following 301.  Oh, I'm going to follow her.  Where's she from?  She's from, like, Denmark or something.  Oh, what the fuck am I going to do?  Flyer here?  She's way over there.  Flyer here? 
[02:48:00]  She's open in now.  Gingerbread house?  Here.  Eat this while I fuck in the shitter.  Look at...  Oh, my.  24,000 likes on Facebook.  Oh, my God.  Has she got any photos on Facebook?  She was in Sports Illustrated.  Yes, she was.  She did quite a job.  Jim Norton quotes on Twitter.  This guy who has an awful apnea picture of me as the thing, and his name is Jim Norton.  The quotes make me laugh because they're so just terrible, and his hashtags are funny. 
[02:48:30]  He's good.  Oh, what?  Oh, just stupid.  Like, he quoted, and then the hashtags are French Jimmy, and Mom, Jack insulted me.  It's just terrible, funny hashtags.  She's Danish, by the way.  Is she really?  She's Danish?  Oh, I'm going to bring her home for Belle.  Oh, shit.  Oh, that bitch.  Yeah, you got the old ice pick in the head. 
[02:49:00]  Yeah.  What's the...  Oh, have you seen the Twitter account Modern Seinfeld?  Yeah.  Seinfeld Today or something?  Yeah.  I wanted it to be better than it was.  So did I.  But there's a couple...  There were a couple of funny things.  There are some good ones.  It's if the Seinfeld world there was still going on, what situations would they get in  using modern technology like cell phones and whatnot and stuff.  What years was Seinfeld on?  Like, 90 to 99 or 2001? 
[02:49:30]  It was pretty much 90 to...  2001.  2001.  Yeah, 90 to 98.  98?  That's it.  The last episode was 98.  Wow.  I thought it was on more than that.  And there was no fucking internet, like, in the beginning of that show.  No.  I was watching...  Oh, yeah.  I think I told you this story.  I was watching a comedian named John Mulaney, who's very funny.  Yeah.  And he does a really funny bit about getting spam email.  And I was watching his act, and I'm thinking...  As I'm just watching him, all the terms, like, spam, link, download, like, these things... 
[02:50:00]  Like, I said to him, like, just 10 years ago, nothing you just said would make sense.  Like, it was really amazing to me.  It would be alien language.  Yeah.  And a certain word, like, click and link existed as other things, but...  Yeah.  Like, fucking download or fucking email.  Like, all these weird words that you never...  Yeah, yeah.  I remember Florentine doing a joke when, like, you know, in the...  When email was in the late 90s.  No, I don't have email.  The girl goes, email me.  I go, how about I F-mail you? 
[02:50:30]  Fuck you.  But, like, he was, like, you know, kind of, like, fuck email.  Right, yeah.  And he's sick of hearing about it, but...  Oh, got like it was going to be a fad.  But you can't comprehend life without it now.  Some of these are really funny.  What?  There are a few funny ones.  Some of them, I don't know, Jim probably wouldn't appreciate them, because I can picture...  If you're a Seinfeld fan, yeah, then you can.  Modern Seinfeld.  Yeah.  What, uh, which one?  Elaine tries to learn the Gangnam Style dance.  George gets creative on his LinkedIn profile.  I see, come on.  They couldn't do that, because it wasn't out. 
[02:51:00]  It's crazy.  Would Elaine do that?  George's parents claim their house was destroyed by Sandy and move in with George.  He discovers their house is fine and Sandy is a loud neighbor.  Ah, see?  Look at that.  Jerry breaks up with his girlfriend because she Instagrams everything she eats.  That's funny.  I would watch that episode.  That's something Jerry would break up with a girl for.  And Jerry would break up with a girl for that.  I got one.  What do you got?  How about...  There, uh, fucking Kramer slides in, but he fucking... 
[02:51:30]  He slides into like a 2010 car or something.  I don't really get it.  Culturally, it doesn't...  Anything new in 2010 cars.  Banya steals jokes from Jerry's tweets.  George lies on Foursquare to avoid his parents.  Kramer leads the less popular Kony 2013 campaign.  That's perfect.  That's funny.  That's good.  Got them all doing something they would do.  Yeah.  With modern technology.  Fucking, how about one time Jerry's emailing somebody and he writes, 
[02:52:00]  Who are these people?  But he sends it to the people he's trying to talk about.  Oh, shit.  Jerry.  It's good.  It's crazy.  He would do that.  I'm huge.  Yeah.  I thought that was pretty funny.  Pretty funny goddamn Twitter site.  Yeah.  But then they're like, I think he's running out already, which is kind of what happens 
[02:52:30]  with these things.  That's why you don't even bother following him.  Do you still follow shit my dad says?  Oh, yeah.  Is that still a...  How long...  Is it?  Yeah.  How long was that show on that Shatner...  A season?  One season.  Oh, boy.  Are you sure it was a full season?  No, it wasn't even a full season.  Was it terrible?  3.1 million followers.  How many?  3.1 million.  Oh, the people still...  Is it still a funny...  There's literally a handful of episodes of the TV show.  I'm talking about the Twitter.  Yeah.  He tweets maybe once a month, maybe. 
[02:53:00]  Oh, is it down from what it used to?  Yeah.  What's the last one?  I like babies.  Just saying they live outside a host body and feed off it.  That's a parasite.  Yes, I could raise a tapeworm and love it.  Oof.  Boom.  TV show.  But that was one of the...  Boom.  TV show.  That was one of the first novelty Twitter accounts.  I want to start one.  Stuff My Dad Says.  Hey, get the salt.  Fucking...  And just really non-interesting things.  Head doors open. 
[02:53:30]  That's my new...  Stuff My Dad Says.  That'd work.  Yeah.  Hey, get the rolling pin.  What are you talking about?  Yeah.  Ah!  Hey, my hat's got rain on it.  Fucking just awful.  Ah!  Shit.  Shit.  Stuff My Dad Says.  I guess people are attempting to ask me if they could post pictures of me.  I...  Can I post pictures of you from Saturday night at FAH? 
[02:54:00]  Yeah.  Who cares?  What do you think?  Unless you took them in the fucking bathroom.  Especially if you took them there, you should post them.  What do I care?  Oh, no.  I don't care if you ask.  I can't carry on conversations with these people.  Are they dumb?  Do they know you're doing a radio show?  Sometimes, no.  No.  Sometimes they really think, like, I could just be...  You're just hanging?  Let me just hang out and talk.  I'm just going to have a little conversation.  There's another thing, too.  I get texts, and people are asking me stuff. 
[02:54:30]  Like, um...  Let's see.  Here's, um...  Cartland.  Tell me he's coming over to my house to pick up his cheesecake today.  I'll write about your goddamn cheesecake.  Wait, why does he leave his cheesecake?  I don't even know why he left his cheesecake today.  Who fucking carries a cheesecake with him?  I don't know.  I forgot my cheesecake.  Who stops off somewhere and bringing the cheesecake to a third destination?  I haven't even asked, by the way.  But there's a cheesecake in my refrigerator. 
[02:55:00]  It's been there since we left FH, went back to my house for a little get-together at my house.  Everybody hung out, drank a few beers, had some fun, ate.  And then I get a text the next day from Cartland saying,  Uh, my cheesecake's in your fridge.  Can you bring it to work tomorrow?  That's a Seinfeld today.  Right?  Would you say no?  I said, yeah, but then I forgot the cheesecake on Monday.  Why would you bring it?  And then why am I bringing it here? 
[02:55:30]  And then when is he coming to pick it up?  And then we gotta put his name in the security so he can pick up the cheesecake.  I'm here to pick up the cheesecake.  Cheesecake?  Cheesecake?  Can I tell you, if that was my house, when he got his cheesecake, he would go,  Why is there a helmet print in my cheesecake?  There would be a cock print in that idiot's cheesecake.  So then today, he's fucking texting me about this cheesecake.  What time?  I'll be over at 2.  Is 2 okay?  I'll be at 2 today to pick up the cheesecake.  How about you fucking leave it out in the rain and then he can write a song about it? 
[02:56:00]  I could go to MacArthur Park.  Yeah, someone left my cheesecake out in the rain next to a Nazi helmet.  But then I can't totally blow him off because he's the only black friend I have now.  He's like the...  He's a nice guy, but...  He's the only black guy I have.  Is it a piece of cheesecake or a whole cake?  It's an entire cheesecake.  Yeah, when he came over for his cheesecake, he would go, I'm picking up my cheesecake.  Oh, it'll be on the front lawn upside down with a shoe print in the underside of the box.  Here's your cheesecake, dummy. 
[02:56:30]  He must really want this cheesecake.  For some reason.  I don't even know why.  There's probably a file in it.  He's going to a jail.  Why would you bring the cheesecake to my house in the first place?  Did he buy it at F.H. Reilly's?  Maybe he owns a factory that makes them.  Maybe he did.  I should fucking put it on the table for him to get and just...  Cheesecake factory.  It's so bad.  I should put it on the table for him to get and just plop that little lawn jackie I have right in the middle of it.  Here you go.  Here's your goddamn cheesecake. 
[02:57:00]  Well, what I would do is I would put it in the driveway and when he came over, he would say,  Why is your truck parked on my cheesecake?  It would be bubbled out on both sides.  You'd have to fucking scrape the side of the tire and fucking just spoon it into his dumb mouth.  How great would it be if you took a shit on his cheesecake and closed the box and he got home and his cheesecake had shit on it?  Just cut out a circle in the middle. 
[02:57:30]  A big, long...  And just doody on his cheesecake.  Oh, he'd be so mad with a doody on his cheesecake.  He'd have to eat around it.  Oh my god, enough about his cheesecake already.  I've had to deal with his cheesecake all fucking weekend now and it's Tuesday and I'm still dealing with his cheesecake.  Oh, that's all you want to do is fucking, like, video yourself cutting hot gassers on it for like two days.  Like, every time you have to fart... 
[02:58:00]  It's melting.  No, you just gently put your ass cheeks right against the cake.  You just send him a tape called 40 gassers on a cheesecake.  Oh, and he realized he's eating the cheesecake and fucking farts all over it.  Little boogies wiped on the cheesecake.  Just cough on it.  Oh my god.  He sneezed on his cheesecake a few times.  40 gassers on a cheesecake.  Cough on it.  I love that one.  Oh, a bunch of coughs. 
[02:58:30]  What would be worse than eating a cheesecake that someone coughed on all weekend?  Oh my god.  He'd be so mad.  I wouldn't eat it.  That'd be, um...  That'd be disgusting.  No, you show him after.  After he's eaten.  A week later, you show him the tape.  Oh my god, yeah.  You send the video that night while he's probably having a piece.  Eating the cheesecake.  A little tinkle on the cheesecake.  Tinkle?  Yeah, just like a little sprinkle.  Like, you shake your cock on the cheesecake when...  I noticed the top of the cheesecake is splitting now.  Not too. 
[02:59:00]  So it must...  It's like now...  Because the cheesecake's been there since Saturday.  Saturday night, Sunday morning kind of...  Why is it splitting?  Is it like a stock?  It like...  It's just a word.  I'm fading fast.  It doesn't work.  No.  Are you overtired?  Oh, Jimmy.  Yes, I am.  I think it's like a...  Like it contracts or something.  Oh, it gets drier.  Well, it has to.  Otherwise, it won't get paid. 
[02:59:30]  I'm sorry.  Holy shit.  It's happy with cheesecake, baby.  Oh, sorry.  It must dry out, and then once the liquid goes away, it kind of pulls apart and cracks down  the middle.  Yeah.  Well, two o'clock, this whole big story finally comes to a conclusion.  This cheesecake storyline finally wraps up.  Or when he got his cheesecake from my house, he would say, why is there what appears to  be a big karate chop dent in my cheesecake? 
[03:00:00]  Would you karate chop it?  All I want to do is open the box and go, hi-yah, and just chop into it.  Oh, my God.  And then just close the box, lick the cheesecake off my hand, and close the box.  Good karate chop cheesecake.  What could you put on it that would ruin it?  All that stuff that you've covered it with, the duty and boogers. 
[03:00:30]  Duty and farts.  Forty gassers.  Or one of your old socks.  Like, you work out in a sock, and then when he opens his cheesecake body, it's just a sock  laid over it.  Athletic sock.  Or two of them in the shape of an X.  The X marks the sock.  Oh, that's terrible.  How about just use toilet paper?  Oh, my God.  Wipe your ass and put it on his cheesecake.  I could do that with, like, chocolate. 
[03:01:00]  And just leave the tissue paper with chocolate streaks on it.  On there and go, yeah, you figure out if it's real or not.  His fucking cheesecake.  I've had to stare at it every time I open that fridge.  It's in the kitchen?  Yeah, kitchen, fridge.  Oh, my God.  It's so stupid, huh?  Oh, cheesecake would be hurting by the time he got it from my house.  It's a dumb cheesecake.  Right, we get it.  He loves that cheesecake.  But he knows that you're working. 
[03:01:30]  Why would he text you now?  Oh, that's what we were talking about.  Yeah, I don't know.  People just feel compelled to do that.  Oh, there he is.  Hey, why do you have a cheesecake?  Cheesecake.  Why is there even a cheesecake that you brought over my house just to take home?  Cheesecake.  No?  Is he answering?  Am I getting an answer?  No.  Got it from Mary.  Sam?  That's not my name.  Oh, Mary's cheesecake. 
[03:02:00]  Mary gave it to him at F.H. Riley's.  Oh.  You should have taken that fucking cheesecake home, yo.  Because now there's farts and shit and jizz on it.  Now there's going to be 40 gassers on it.  Sounds like a fucking nice book.  Have Stephen Baldwin and Pam Anderson both been arrested for tax evasion?  Can you look that up?  Wow.  They had arrested?  Well, I don't think Pamela Anderson was arrested.  She just owes like $370,000.  Maybe Stephen Baldwin was arrested.  Maybe Charlie Sheen could foot the bill.  How much does he owe? 
[03:02:30]  I don't find that.  Well, you know that Charlie Sheen gave Lindsay Lohan $100,000 for that?  She apparently hasn't even texted him any kind of thank you or anything.  She's a fucking hateable cunt of a person.  Totally.  Why, he said that she hasn't?  Yeah, I heard on the news today.  She hasn't even acknowledged that he did it.  She's just a hateable fucking cunt.  Yes.  Wow.  Yeah.  It's rare that I really actively root against someone like that as hard. 
[03:03:00]  Uh-huh.  What a hateable bitch.  Lindsay Lohan hasn't thanked me for the $100,000.  Wow.  Well, Charlie was stupid to do that.  Totally.  It's like, I'm sure that you've given money to charity.  But how about you give that money to fucking Sandy victims?  Yeah.  Instead of some fucking spoiled brat.  I bet he just wants some of that fucking earth.  Yeah, that was stupid of him to do.  Yeah.  I saw her in that fucking movie.  What is that?  Bad Girls?  Mean Girls.  Mean Girls.  Bad Girls.  Mean Girls.  Nasty Girls.  Mean Girls.  She looks great.  She looked fucking amazing in that. 
[03:03:30]  That was her peak.  That was her peak.  That was 2004.  2004?  How old was she there?  It could be in trouble again.  Ooh, look out.  Don't fucking talk about fucking Michaela Moroni.  18.  Oh, she was 18.  All right.  That's good.  Is that good?  Crazy, religious, right fucking idiots that are giving me shit about a gymnast and a joke  I made about her hymen? 
[03:04:00]  Are they still giving you shit?  Dude, and they're all, like, you click on them, all their profiles.  I am a go with Jesus, conservative, Republican.  Oh, I love this.  I love this.  I'm like, somebody, like, said, dude, you read these profiles?  No wonder we lost.  We're like, yeah.  That's her from...  That was Mean Girls, Lindsay Lohan era.  Yeah.  She's so sexy, bro.  Look at those tits.  She's a rough 26 now.  She is so ridden hard and put up wet now.  It's insane.  She don't even look near good. 
[03:04:30]  No.  And she's just a brat.  Yeah.  She's just a cunt.  Yeah.  She gets away with it every fucking time.  How do you steal jewelry or lie to a cop about whether you were driving and not spend time  in jail?  How does that fucking happen?  Oh, look at her now.  You don't think that looks good?  She's just, what?  26.  She looks like shit.  Fat, dumb face.  Yeah.  She's all bloaty.  She got the big fake lips. 
[03:05:00]  Oh, man.  Are there any Liz clips?  I watched a couple.  Oh, she was so bad.  Oh, God.  She's terrible.  Yeah.  She was really bad in that movie.  I watched it.  It was just a terrible movie.  Right.  But she was specifically bad in it.  Horribly.  They actually made it so that I didn't care about either of those two people.  Oh, of course she was.  Was he bad, too, or no?  He wasn't great.  Who was he?  Richard Burton.  I don't know who played it.  Who played Richard Burton?  But, I mean, it was an interesting story that Richard Burton actor put a horrible accent  on. 
[03:05:30]  He had an accent, but I don't know if he naturally has one or not.  Oh.  But Lindsay Lohan could not keep an accent.  She kept, like, floating in and out of an Elizabeth Taylor voice.  Oh, no.  What is Elizabeth Taylor's accent?  You know, it's like pseudo-British.  That Hollywood snob Madonna thing.  Yeah, upsy-ritzy-titsy-bitch type shit.  Except it kept falling into a raspy Long Island.  Oh.  The whole time.  A raspy Long Island.  The whole time.  She plays that well.  All right, let's hear a little of this.  Elizabeth. 
[03:06:00]  Yeah.  Elizabeth.  We have to meet this man.  This is Ernest Lehman.  I'm going to write.  Sweet smell of success.  North by Northwest, we love your work.  Oh, thank you.  I wish you'd write something for me.  Actually, I have something.  Who's afraid of Virginia Woolf?  Oh, I love the play.  But we could do it together.  Well, do you start a new film?  The Spy Who Came In From the Cold.  Yes, but I could do this one after that.  I'm afraid you're a little too masculine for George, and I can't quite see it.  And I can't imagine the two of you fighting right there. 
[03:06:30]  Oh, well, do you hear that, my little sugar toss?  You can't imagine us fighting.  Well, it doesn't matter, because why would anyone hire a vomiting vat of vodka like this?  Well, at least when I vomit, I make mellifluous sounds, unlike your little mouse crap squeaks.  Oh, God.  Wow.  She was awful.  Horrible.  It was Lindsay Lohan.  I watched the whole movie.  It was at no point.  You never got the impression that you were watching Elizabeth Taylor?  Not for one second.  You didn't get lost in the character? 
[03:07:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's like, wow, I didn't even realize after a while.  It's just watching Liz.  I was like, oh, yeah, Lindsay Lohan is a mess.  They probably told her she was brilliant.  Oh, I'm sure.  You might be nominated for this.  I mean.  This was supposed to be her big comeback, like, oh, yeah, we forgot she's a great actress.  I'm glad it flopped, because she's such a fucking snot.  Well, she's not a great actress.  I don't know why anybody's ever said that.  Like, she was fine in Mean Girls, but she was just playing a kid.  She was a kid.  Yeah, she was just playing Lindsay Lohan, I think.  Right.  Yeah.  And she's not a good enough actress to distract from the fact that she's such a public twat and 
[03:07:30]  a disaster.  She can't transcend that.  And in Mean Girls, she was reading Tina Fey's lines.  Exactly.  There are a few actors that can transcend their personal problems.  Charlie Sheen did, but he was famous before, and he had been on Platoon and Wall Street.  He's a great actor.  I think Robert Downey is a great example.  Exactly.  Possibly the best.  Who transcended his personal problems.  Because he's so good.  Yes.  His acting is so good, you can't not want to watch him.  She's fantastic.  Not an actress, but Amy Winehouse was good enough singing that she could do whatever 
[03:08:00]  she wanted.  I mean, she killed herself.  Well, she killed herself, so that really isn't quite transcending.  Yeah, but you still listen to her.  Well, I still listen to her.  Well, you do, because you're gay.  I'm not the gayest.  You're a gee.  I'm not that gay.  I'm not the gayest.  No.  The gayest.  Yeah, I don't know anybody else that was really heavy into fucking drugs and actually came  out of it.  Mel Gibson is trying, boy.  Is he trying?  Mel Gibson, his drug is racism and anti-Semitism, but wasn't he able to kind of get through 
[03:08:30]  that and finance his own shit?  Yeah, he always financed his own shit.  Why can't he do that now, though?  Yeah.  Like, why doesn't he make another movie?  Can you open the fucking curtains, please?  I know.  It's curtains for you.  I'm claustrophobic.  Yeah.  It was, ugh.  Mickey Rourke did it and then slipped back out of it.  He didn't have enough on top time to be considered.  Mickey Rourke's a great actor.  There you go.  The Wrestler was awesome.  He was great in that.  Yeah, but that's fucking, how many years ago?  Four?  Right. 
[03:09:00]  Already?  Four years?  He hasn't done anything as good as The Wrestler since The Wrestler.  John Travolta in his straight-on hair.  These are just comebacks.  I'm just looking.  Well, yeah.  That Pulp Fiction comeback for him was huge.  Yeah.  Huge.  Yeah, not necessarily drug comebacks or anything like that.  Who else has transcended their personal...  Yeah.  Personal dilemmas.  Problems.  There are some other actors that have...  Yeah.  Sure.  A lot of musicians, but I mean actors, because actors, you have to...  You might be able to say Drew Barrymore.  She went through that wild stage. 
[03:09:30]  Yes, as a youngster.  Celebiotant stage.  Celebiotant.  Ooh.  She was the Lindsay Lohan of her day.  If we had TMZ when Drew Barrymore was around, you know how much Drew Barrymore shit would  be all over the place?  Crazy.  Right?  Yeah.  Yeah, she was.  Yeah, she was.  She was doing coke and drunk at like 12 years old.  Didn't you?  Wasn't she the one who went on Letterman's show and like flashed her tits?  Yeah.  Yeah.  She was already like...  She had already made her comeback then.  Yeah.  The fucking monkey with the coat on at Ikea. 
[03:10:00]  Pretty adorable.  Where?  Is there...  Yeah.  Look at that.  Oh, that's very cute.  What's it doing?  It's wearing a little coat.  Buying Ikea.  Yeah.  Dapper monkey charms.  Why is he wearing a coat?  It's cold out.  Aw.  Monkeys are from Africa and fucking tropical places.  They don't hang out in the freezing weather.  Look at those little diapers.  We're wearing a diaper.  He's got a little coat on.  In case he goes duty by mistake.  He might make some duties.  Like take monkey shit and put it on that cheesecake.  Oh, and I love a monkey.  That'd be great.  Where monkey paw prints in it because their fucking chimp hands are so dirty. 
[03:10:30]  Yes.  Do you know how a monkey would tear up a cheesecake?  If you sat a fucking monkey in front of a cheesecake and...  It would just rip it up with its hands and eat it.  It really would.  30 seconds with a cheesecake and then you re-box it.  Right.  There you go.  It would be destroyed.  I love monkeys, but they cannot handle fine cake.  No, and they're filthy.  You don't ever want to take something from a monkey's hand and eat it.  If a monkey offers you a snack, turn it down.  Do you know a monkey... 
[03:11:00]  I shared a bottle of water with a monkey.  When he was sitting on my lap, he drank some.  Oh, I remember that.  And then he put it in my mouth.  And they're usually very selfish.  They don't do that.  That was...  Mikey.  Mikey the chimp.  And he did that for me years before.  And they normally do not share.  So I felt it was a great honor.  That was very cute.  Wasn't that cute?  I liked it.  What did it taste like?  What did it taste like?  Just water.  It's all I care.  Monkey water?  Monkey breath water?  He was very cute.  And he did remember me.  That's so weird that he remembered you.  He had a primate.  It took a while.  He had a little monkey face. 
[03:11:30]  Goddamn fucking monkeys.  They're adorable.  I wanted a monkey so bad when I was a kid.  Like, every kid wants a monkey.  Doesn't every kid kind of want a monkey?  I guess.  Hypothetically.  But nobody...  Most kids, I don't think, think of it as a reality.  Like, oh, this is something I want to do.  Most kids.  Because when I watched The Little Rascals, Spanky always had a monkey.  Oh.  We didn't watch The Little Rascals because we're much younger than that.  Reruns.  Oh.  Like I was in the 30s watching them first run.  I don't know.  What's a rerun?  Oh, very good.  A fat guy who died eventually because he had diabetes and used to be a good dancer. 
[03:12:00]  We got it, Jim.  We got it.  I was watching Psy's Christmas performance that he filmed on Sunday.  From the White House?  Like the DC one?  He didn't...  They don't say Gangnam Style.  What?  Oh, no.  I knew this.  Do you want to watch the whole intro up until...  Did you say fuck America style?  Yeah.  That's what I thought.  Yes.  Either Obama or White House style.  America style.  You got any more volume over there? 
[03:12:30]  Come on.  Wait.  Jack froze nipping at your nose.  Jack froze nipping.  He stinks.  South Korea rappers can be very feminine.  American rappers could not do this like that.  He's terrible.  This is not the reason why I'm here.  Oh!  That's the reason!  Who gives a shit?  His song.  That's the big surprise?  He's doing the dance. 
[03:13:00]  He must hate this.  All right.  But he knows it's over afterwards.  Yes.  Yeah, yeah.  He does.  He's performing for the president.  Yeah, yeah.  Where's the president?  Yeah.  The boys dancing with him. 
[03:13:30]  Yeah.  The boys.  Very fruity.  Now he's a bit crazy.  He's in a Christmas red, too.  All right.  What happened?  What happened?  Oh.  Santa fa...  Oh!  Oh, no!  Oh, my God.  Christmas style? 
[03:14:00]  It's Christmas.  Oh, no.  My head itches.  Embarrassing.  They're dressed like reindeer.  Baby, baby, I'm the boy.  Jump out of your water.  From now on, everybody, make some noise.  All right with the dumb fucking dance.  Santa baby?  Whop on Christmas style.  Oh!  I just got a deuce chill.  Whop on Christmas style. 
[03:14:30]  Wow.  When they do a retrospective of from 2010 to 2020, everyone's going to go, oh, God, remember?  Yeah.  Remember that?  Remember Psy?  Oh, man.  Hello, Macarena.  I forgot that.  Why is it...  Hold on.  Why is my fucking iPhone light going low?  It doesn't sometimes.  Why?  I don't know.  Why don't you just click the button on top?  Yeah, just click the top button.  And, uh, yeah.  Cocksucker. 
[03:15:00]  What an awful piece of technology.  It's the ghost of Steve Jobs getting in the machine.  A ghost in the machine, man.  It's a conspiracy.  That was terrible.  Do you think he knows?  Do you like Christmas style?  No.  Do you think he knows he's...  Christmas style?  He is Macarena and who let the dogs out and...  I don't know, because he's bigger than them because of YouTube.  YouTube, when you have 600 million hits...  Craziness.  When almost a billion people have seen it, you've bought some longevity.  There's just too many people for you to go away immediately. 
[03:15:30]  Yeah.  Nobody's going to want to hear another song from him.  I would love to.  What were the follow-up to Gangnam Style?  It'll be something...  There's other Psy songs, right?  There are.  Yeah, he's tried it.  Yeah, they sound just like...  Since then?  Yeah, he's had songs come out since then.  Oh!  Pretty girl.  Yeah, sexy fellas for the guys.  Whoa.  He came out with Christmas style and mash-up style.  I just sometimes go around my house and say that.  I go around the house sometimes and go, morning mash-up style.  Just for no reason.  Well, it's catchy. 
[03:16:00]  Yeah.  It's in your head.  We have...  I talk to myself a lot at home.  The wrong number of syllables.  Yeah.  Yeah, that doesn't work.  Opinante style, no.  No.  Owen Day style doesn't work.  Mm-mm.  No.  Too bad, too.  Because we could have gotten on this trend just as it's getting hot.  Jimmy Norton style works.  Jimmy Norton style works.  Even Sam Roberts style.  That works.  No, it doesn't.  It works pretty well.  Eric Nagel style.  Yes.  Eric Nagel style.  Yeah, that works perfectly.  Tank.  Hankra style. 
[03:16:30]  Dog virus style.  No.  Oh, on Ellen.  How many times has he performed this?  I'm just curious to see if he does...  Oh, I see.  Like...  Ellen style?  Yeah.  What about Ellen?  Oh, no.  Ellen style.  I don't know if he does it.  I don't either.  I don't either.  Uh-oh.  Almost 6 million views.  It's got like 800 million on them.  Ellen's video.  No. 
[03:17:00]  Oh, they're all dancing.  Yeah, the fat yentus.  No.  Oh, no.  He just did it.  All right, good.  I think he's going to do it Ellen style.  I know.  And then they all put their hands up in front of their face like they're parting something  and they flick their tongue out.  They start scissoring on the floor.  Putting on fake penises. 
[03:17:30]  He doesn't want to sing half the song.  No, he doesn't.  Why would he?  That's the record play.  Do you think it's just played in clubs?  Yeah.  Still?  Yeah, Troy says it's still played.  There's nothing that sounds more dated than like a two or three year old club song.  Yeesh.  Like, I remember when I went to Brazil.  What was the big club songs in like 2003 and 2004?  Because they were playing them in the club we went into. 
[03:18:00]  Sam?  Comment?  In a club?  In a club?  It was, uh, this is for my people.  My people.  Oh, who the fuck is that?  It was a good club song.  I mean, uh, but it's so fucking...  Missy Elliott?  Yeah, play that a little bit.  But this was what was playing in Brazil.  Maybe in 2004.  My mother...  Club heads, you feel me?  Do you remember this?  Yeah. 
[03:18:30]  This was fucking cute.  Motherfucking Missy Elliott.  What happened to Missy Elliott?  Where'd she go?  But it sounds...  The club song sounds terribly dated.  Yeah.  You don't remember this or no?  Not really.  How about...  Find KY's Stomp.  Did we play that recently?  We talked about it.  What?  No?  Doesn't ring a bell.  I remember I went and saw this guy.  This was a huge song when I was just getting sober, I think. 
[03:19:00]  KY's.  And the song was called Stomp.  KY's.  But I remember I went and saw him live at a club.  Yeah.  I didn't think I was doing stand-up yet.  I might have been.  Sam, you want to pop that up?  KY's.  Yeah.  Stomp.  Oh, this sounds old.  Oh, God, yeah.  Oh, this is so old school.  Okay, uh, what?  Hammer pants.  Some girls were trying to jump in the limo with them.  I saw some hammer pants.  This is so... 
[03:19:30]  What year was this song?  I'm guessing.  Is it 91 or 92?  Damn.  Sorry, it's Stomp.  I can't even listen to it.  It's terrible.  It's crazy.  Stomp, whatever it was.  They look too goofy to even be threatening.  Like, they weren't gangster rappers or nothing.  No.  What?  He's here.  Oh.  Oh.  Come on, dude.  Well, I tell you about it.  No, I know, but I said now, and you said then the thing.  Yeah, yeah.  I said three minutes before he does the next video.  He's here now.  He's here.  You want to go now?  Yeah, yeah.  I want to go now.  That's what I was going to say.  Get a fucking picture.  Jimmy's going to get a picture. 
[03:20:00]  Get a picture, Jimmy.  Well, I've got to get Jimmy's plugs.  Let's see if he comes back.  Famous picture style.  Jimmy loves celebrity pictures.  Jimmy loves celebrity pictures.  That was so funny and childlike today when he said, imagine if for the 12-12-12 thing  they charged a million dollars to take a picture with everybody.  First of all, any fantasy scenario that includes a million dollars is a juvenile fantasy. 
[03:20:30]  They try to justify it a little bit.  Yeah, yeah.  Maybe not that much.  But it's like, yeah, what would you do with a million dollars?  Would you do that for a million dollars?  Like a million dollars is just kind of goofy.  Probably costs like a jillion dollars.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I wouldn't do that for a Googleplex.  Oh, there's no number higher than Googleplex. 
[03:21:00]  That's where Google came from.  Googleplex?  Yeah.  Or did you just say that?  No, I think it is.  I think that's where they got the name from.  That's like another one of those things that, who thought we'd be saying words like Google?  Google.  Google.  I held up so long trying to still use Yahoo search when everyone was using Google.  Yahoo.  I'm like, nah, Yahoo's better.  And then one day I had to admit.  I remember going on message boards and begging people for Gmail invites.  Gmail?  Yeah.  Danny gave me my Gmail invite. 
[03:21:30]  Yeah.  I was so appreciative.  When that shit was new, because you got like three gigs of storage or something.  Yeah.  And you needed to be invited.  Yeah.  It was a cool club.  It was tarted.  And then I just wanted to go and give people my email address.  Yeah, Gmail.  Yeah.  You know.  I don't know how I got it.  Yeah, well, don't worry about it.  It's an invite thing, but I only got a few, so.  Maybe when I get some more.  And then finally, like, you always had 99 invites and it didn't matter anymore.  And then eventually it was just open.  It was just open.  Does anyone even care about that anymore?  About Gmail?  About that.  No, the Gmail.  Google Plus?  Google Plus, yeah. 
[03:22:00]  Oh, Google Plus is over.  Totally done.  It's very hard to create a social network.  Yeah.  Like, it almost always fails.  Like, Facebook didn't set out to do, you know, to overtake my space.  You gotta have a slow build.  Yeah, exactly.  Like, Facebook was meant for college students.  Yeah.  And like, look, Apple failed so hard with Ping.  Apple 5?  Ping?  Yeah.  I use Ping on my Apple 5?  I don't really trust the other social networks, but Ping is always, you know, it's got a 
[03:22:30]  nice Apple on it, shiny, silver.  That chick rolls.  Still hasn't been flushed out, huh?  Can't figure out who she is, where she's from?  No.  Love to have her on the show.  Yeah.  She was great.  Oh, he was a nice guy?  Very nice guy.  And he's a great character on that show.  I love him.  He had a beard?  He looks exactly the way.  Yeah, good.  I hate it when people don't look like they look on TV.  Does it happen a lot?  All the time.  Do you have to meet with a boss today? 
[03:23:00]  Kenny just asked me.  No.  Okay, good.  No, Kenny.  We're going home.  I got shit to do.  All right, Jimmy, where...  You got a cheesecake to give away.  I know.  Yeah, yeah.  I got to get home for the great cheesecake exchange.  You got to fart 40 times before he gets there.  Big fucking cheesecake exchange.  All right, let me whore this nonsense.  No Baby For You is available on iTunes now, Amazon.com.  It comes out today.  On sale this Friday will be my February 17th date at the Borgata. 
[03:23:30]  Myself, Dave Attell, Artie Lang, and Amy Schumer has been added.  Amy is on fucking fire.  She's doing nothing but theaters now, so it's nice to watch another friend rocket past me.  Oh, boy.  Buffalo, Monday, December 28th through 31st to New Year's Eve.  Yes.  And April 11th through 14th here in New York at Caroline's.  January 10th through 12th in Nashville at Zany's.  And then my first time in San Diego doing stand-up, 25th and 26th of January in the American Comedy Company. 
[03:24:00]  So I hope people come out and watch that fucking concert.  Is that tomorrow?  Yeah.  Oh, it's 12 till 12.  Yeah, it's on Epix and it's on a bunch of other networks.  I think we're streaming it on a couple channels here, too.  I think I'll be live-tweeting that one.  It's going to be a good one.  Yeah, we should.  I can't watch it.  It'll be fun.  Why?  I'm fucking doing karate.  I don't know what I'm talking about.  All right, people. 
[03:24:30]  Same bad time.  Same bad channel.  See you tomorrow.  How long has it been since I've seen a vagina in person?  Really?  Yes.  Who's showing me?  Fucking nobody is showing me their vagina.  Sirius XM.  Hey, hey, hey.  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues.  This is After O&A Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  Yes, sir.  It's after Opie and Anthony Live.  It's what happens after Opie and Anthony are live. 
[03:25:00]  And it's also live.  I'm Sam Roberts.  Call me up.  866-WOW-1-WOW.  Did you learn anything today, Eric?  I'm sure I did.  I'm sure I did.  Sorry, I was loading something here.  I just need to go through my memory and figure out what I learned.  You're not...  The illusion is supposed to be that we're not reading things off paper here, Eric.  No, but I write stuff down.  Well, yeah, I know that.  But the illusion is supposed to be that it's coming from your memory. 
[03:25:30]  I understand that you write stuff down.  There was just a lot of random...  whatever.  Somebody's...  That's your review of today's show.  Yeah.  A lot of random whatever.  Oh, I do...  Yeah.  Thanks for trying, Ant and Jim.  No, no, no, not for them, but...  Just me.  Just my contributions.  One thing I wrote down, that Jim still has a six-year-old plasma TV that he thinks is  still, like, technologically relevant.  It's probably a shit ton better than my TV. 
[03:26:00]  I had the sense that the way you were talking about it, you were trying to ask Jim for his  old television.  Of course that's where I was angling.  Jim was talking about his old TV and what he's going to do with it, because he's got a  six-year-old plasma TV.  It's like 50 inches, though.  And Jim's like, what am I going to do, sell it?  And I'm just like, yeah, or you can give it away.  But nobody picked up on the fact that Jim could just give it to me.  Yeah.  I mean, I'm rocking 32 inches.  No, I did.  I knew what you were doing.  Well, hopefully it'll...  Hopefully that'll seep in sort of under the radar with Jim, and it'll just kind of sit  there in the back of his brain, and one day he'll come in with a 50-inch plasma for 
[03:26:30]  me.  Because six years old or not...  Still good.  It beats a 32-inch Sony, you know, $350 TV.  That's what I'm rocking right now.  How many TVs you got in that big mansion of yours, Eric?  Uh, five.  Five flat screens, huh?  Yeah.  And what's the smallest one?  How big is it?  The smallest one is a 21-inch in the kitchen.  Okay.  I got it in the kitchen. 
[03:27:00]  Yeah.  Well, it's an important place for him.  Have you spent a lot of time in there?  You might need to...  I'm surprised you don't have the biggest one in the kitchen.  No, the biggest one is in the living room.  Eric's got a very cool setup.  He's got, like, a living room.  Do you still have it where, like, the TV is around the corner from the fireplace there?  No.  It's now mounted above the fireplace.  That's what I did this weekend.  And then are you going to put another TV behind it?  I think so.  I think that's the case.  He's got this thing, like, when you walk into his house, the first room is a living room.  And that's where the fireplace is, and there's couches. 
[03:27:30]  It's like...  He lives...  He's got a great house.  And then there's a wall.  It's not like a full wall, because it's on either side.  It's just like a separator, almost.  And you go around it, and it's almost like a porch.  And he used to have the TV over on the other side.  So one side, you just sit and talk, and there's a fireplace.  And literally, you just walk around the other side of the wall.  You hang out on the porch, and there's a TV.  However, as we've learned from Eric, he's put the TV above the fireplace, and then you're 
[03:28:00]  going to walk around the wall, and we'll throw another TV there.  Wow.  Yeah, we felt that one was too big for where the couch was.  It was too big a TV, and too short a distance from the TV.  Won't the sound bleed into each other?  No, I don't think so.  You're not even worried about that?  No.  You're not thinking that far ahead?  No.  Worst case scenario, you throw some phones on, right?  I love it.  Right above the fireplace.  It's got the infrared on it.  Everything's tucked away in a closet.  Oh, my God.  To live like that, huh?  Are you going to put a projector outside?  Didn't you say you were going to do that? 
[03:28:30]  Yeah, but I didn't get the fence work done that I wanted to.  So when it gets done this spring, then I'll have the outdoor movie.  Are you putting a pool out there?  No, I don't have enough property for a pool.  What about a hot tub?  I tried, but it's fighting an uphill battle right now.  Why your wife doesn't want one?  Yeah, she doesn't want one.  Why?  Why don't you get rid of that feminine garden that she's put in and throw a hot tub in there and  get some chicks over it?  Well, minus that part, I was thinking, you know, the hot tub would be good, especially  in the winter when it's snowing.  You go right out there.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  But yeah, get some chicks over. 
[03:29:00]  You don't have to touch them.  Just a little eye candy, you know?  Be like, oh, Troy's coming over and he's bringing chicks.  And just pretend they're all there for Troy.  I bring some bitches.  You get some bitches, right?  Yeah.  Bikinis?  Naked.  Okay, good.  Then you'll be like, sorry, Mrs. Nagel.  And to you talking, Eric, you call your wife Mrs. Nagel.  You'd be like, sorry, Mrs. Nagel.  I didn't know.  It's not my fault.  Yeah.  Yeah, I invited Troy.  I didn't know this was going to happen, but they're here, so let's have a good time.  You know he's a wild man, after all.  Yes, but this was the same guy who said it was too much of a haul to leave Manhattan to  come out to my place.  I'll come out.  It's just hard to get out there. 
[03:29:30]  You know that, though.  Yeah.  I will.  It's not that hard to get out there.  If I get the invite out, I don't think I'm going to get an invite out, though.  I wouldn't invite you again.  I understand that if he didn't.  But I hope he has a change of heart.  How many times did you invite Troy to your house?  Twice.  Twice.  And how many times did he show up?  Zero.  Well, the one.  And actually, and if I remember correctly, we talked to you about it on the air, and you  said, my time is valuable.  It is.  All right.  So that kind of spells it out.  Let's understand, when you take a train out there, it's not just like a 30-minute car  ride out there.  It's probably like said and done, like over two hours to get out there.  I don't think it would take that long. 
[03:30:00]  I guarantee it would.  It takes from my apartment to get to...  It's 15 miles at most.  Yeah.  And you live in Manhattan now.  Your apartment takes how long to get to Grand Central?  It would probably take me about 45 minutes to an hour to get there from my place.  And that's like...  I'm thinking more like 45 minutes.  If you look at a train schedule before you go...  And then waiting for another train, it'll probably take another 45 minutes to an hour.  I think you'd take 45 minutes from your door to Eric's door.  No.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  No.  You're wrong.  I don't think so. 
[03:30:30]  I think, though, you think your time is very valuable.  And you don't want to waste time at the Nagle's house.  Anthony in New Orleans.  Good morning, Sam Roberts, the king of the after show.  Thank you, Anthony.  Sam, I am literally sitting in the bathroom covering my mouth during the cheesecake story  not to laugh so loud.  There's so many people walking in the bathroom.  I didn't want to embarrass myself.  It's very strange when a tangent gets brought up.  Because, you know, we've got all these topics flying around.  We were talking about, you know, technology, old phones, club songs.  And the thing that stuck was cheesecake. 
[03:31:00]  And not just cheesecake in general, but Carlton's specific cheesecake.  Yeah, well, that's it for Anthony then.  Apparently he doesn't have a lot to talk about as far as cheesecake goes.  All right, Anthony.  He should have just taken it to the range and made a video.  Do we have Carlton's phone number?  No.  All right, Carlton.  Why did you say it like that?  Why would I have Carlton's phone number?  I don't know.  If he's good enough to leave cheesecake at Ant's house, I thought he might be good enough  that we had his phone number.  No.  All right, well, Carlton, if you're listening, call in. 
[03:31:30]  I'd like to find out more about this cheesecake.  Roland?  What is it?  Superfly Snooka canceled today.  Yeah.  We can't do that.  If he doesn't feel well, he can't come in.  His wife isn't feeling well, unfortunately.  Yeah, Troy.  That's your rest.  You weren't here yesterday, but we were supposed to have Jimmy Superfly Snooka in here today.  I know.  You would have been excited about that.  Fuck yeah.  I mean, he's the Superfly.  He's the man.  But next week will be good, too.  Yeah, Superfly's supposed to be coming in next week.  So then we'll have Apatow, Attell, and Snooka.  Judd Apatow's coming in next week, too?  This is news, Roland. 
[03:32:00]  And then it was Apatow and Attell together.  Judd Apatow and David Attell will be in here together next week.  Next week.  That'll be good.  This week, we still got some shit going on.  Thursday's going to be great.  What's Thursday?  A full hour of Tarantino.  We have Quentin Tarantino for an hour on Thursday?  Yeah, for Jango.  I love the movie.  It's so good.  I want to see it badly.  Jango.  There's Tonight and Tomorrow.  The last two screenings.  We'll see if it works out time-wise.  Did you stay up for it?  I stayed up for that and Zero Dark Thirty.  I've heard Jango's a little long. 
[03:32:30]  It is, but it's really good, though.  I mean, Christoph Waltz is amazing in this one.  You think he's going to get nominated again?  He fucking deserves it.  Wow, really?  He's so good.  He won the Oscar for the World War II movie, didn't he?  Yeah, yeah.  Inglourious Basterds.  Inglourious Basterds.  But Jessica Chastain deserves the Oscar for her role in Zero Dark Thirty.  Jessica Chastain?  Yeah, she's so good.  Zero Dark Thirty is the movie about Bin Laden.  Yeah.  You saw it? 
[03:33:00]  Yeah.  You liked it?  It was really good.  Was it better than Hurt Locker?  Yes.  It was?  Yes.  It's like the true story of them hunting Bin Laden down.  Yeah, and that's why they say Catherine Bigelow got in trouble, because some of the information  she has is supposedly classified.  How did Catherine Bigelow get classified information?  Everybody wants to meet actors and celebrities.  Oh, so you're saying some military people.  Yeah, or somebody goes, hey, I know some info.  And they saw Hurt Locker.  Yeah.  So they like her already.  Yeah.  And they want it to, oh, wait till I tell you this story, that story. 
[03:33:30]  Everybody wants to be with celebrities.  And all of a sudden, she's feeding scriptwriters all the information.  Yeah.  But her scriptwriter is the same guy who wrote Hurt Locker.  Interesting.  They're both partners.  Interesting.  So that's what it is.  People just love.  They love it.  They love show business, huh?  They love it.  Because no matter how much money you have, you can't buy into it.  Right.  So they just want to know the stories.  You have to be in it.  Yeah.  Do you know, like, do you know the value of your stories?  Like, do you have stories that you know you could hang out with people who just want  to hear stories, like military people or whoever? 
[03:34:00]  Yeah.  Sometimes you get invited to some places.  You know, you have to deliver some stories.  Like, you go, okay, I'll just say the safe ones.  So you have tiers of stories?  Yeah.  Like, this story is good for this area.  This story is good for them.  And then if, like, an executive from some company, you know, like a high-powered person,  you're like, okay.  You're high-powered.  You're like, hey.  And then they go, ooh.  Like, what's the type of story that would be low enough that you would just talk to  us about it?  That's whatever I say on the air. 
[03:34:30]  Like what?  That's like, I can say, like, certain stories about the TRL days, like, they're safe.  Like what?  What's one?  Well, I got to go back and rethink some of them.  We'll go.  We'll go with a safe one.  I don't know.  The TRL days, you said.  Because for those that don't know, Roland was Carson Daly, I can say that, right?  Yeah.  His assistant.  Yeah.  And so you were with him 24-7.  Yeah.  And you were with him throughout all those crazy TRL days.  Yeah, through NBC and that.  And that's when he was breaking, when he was at his peak.  Yeah.  You were with him at MTV? 
[03:35:00]  Yeah.  Oh, cool.  That's crazy, right?  So basically.  Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera.  Oh, yeah.  And back then, he was the fucking man.  He was bigger than Seacrest for a moment.  Yeah.  Yeah, he had the opportunity to seize it.  And what happened?  You know, I mean, things happen.  I mean, it's a different era, though, because Seacrest was focused.  Carson liked to party a little bit.  Yeah, I mean, he loves to, I mean, get his friends, like, fly everybody out to the Kentucky  Derby, and we all dressed up like those fools.  Did you wear a hat?  You dressed up like that era. 
[03:35:30]  So you guys went to the Kentucky Derby dressed in, like, derby hats and stuff?  Oh, yeah, everything.  Like, decked out.  I think Roland's seen some shit.  And Seacrest is over here, like, working.  Like, Seacrest is building an empire, and Carson Daly doesn't even see him coming.  So Carson's like, yeah, let's go hang out.  Let's go to the Kentucky Derby and wear costumes.  And Seacrest is like, oh, I'm plotting, I'm plotting.  Yeah, it's like when we had, they were so obsessed at one point with fantasy football  and baseball.  Fantasy.  Fantasy.  It sounded like you said fantasy football.  Oh, no, fantasy. 
[03:36:00]  And there was, like, a lot.  It's like Emmett Smith in a tuxedo.  It won't work.  I basically was there to, if he needs extra players, I could, like, do, like, unfair  trades.  You would unfairly trade fantasy football?  Or baseball players.  Like, oh, man, you have Jeter?  He goes, I need Jeter.  So, like, I trained him Jeter for, like, two no names.  This doesn't count as one of the safe stories, does it?  It does count.  I mean, that's not a good story.  I know, but it's like, there's a lot of celebrities in his league.  Okay.  And at the, like, mid-season, we will, right now, a steakhouse, dress in tuxedos and eat 
[03:36:30]  steak and wine all night long.  And this whole time, Seacrest is writing up his little plans and he's doing his radio thing.  And, oh, this new show, American Idol, is looking for a host.  Carson Daly's like, fuck American Idol.  I'm Mr. MTV.  Let's go to the Kentucky Derby.  He's going for the NBC.  He wanted to go that route as a talk show host.  Like the late night thing.  Mm-hmm.  He's still doing it.  He's still doing his thing.  He's still doing the ratings well now because it's a different format.  And was he sitting there going, like, what the fuck are you guys doing hiring this Jimmy 
[03:37:00]  Fallon guy?  I've been late nighting forever.  Why wouldn't you bump me up?  They're both, I don't know, it's tough though because they're both buddies.  Him and Jimmy Fallon?  Yeah, yeah.  I wouldn't be buddies anymore if Jimmy Fallon took my gig.  I'd be like, let me tell you something, Jimmy Fallon.  There's one host to the after show.  It's not after Opie and Anthony Live with Jimmy Fallon.  No.  It's after Opie and Anthony Live with Sam Roberts.  The guy who runs that time slot was Lorne Michaels.  So it's like, that's his boy.  So Carson knew.  He was like, I don't have a shot here.  Yeah, like, who picks it?  Lorne Michaels?  All right.  So when did Carson Daly realize, oh, no, here comes Seacrest? 
[03:37:30]  I don't know.  I mean, you could see it though.  It's not like it was a surprise.  You could just see him.  Once he.  Was it American Idol?  Yeah, once he knocked off that guy.  Ryan Dunkelman, whoever the other guy was.  Once he Dunkelmaned him way out.  Like when Ryan took people out.  Hey, yeah, let's, let's, let me, I'm going to take everybody out for dinner.  We love Ryan.  And then he goes, I'm starting a production company.  We love Ryan.  At that point, Carson's got to be like, oh, no.  Well, he had, he started a music production company.  4, 5, 6.  Carson did? 
[03:38:00]  Yeah.  He founded like the streets.  The streets?  He founded the streets.  Carson Daly is the streets.  You know, the hip hop group, the streets?  Have you ever heard of them, Troy?  I have.  They're from London.  And then he did a couple other groups that.  Didn't work out, huh?  Overseas, it did well.  But here in the States where it counts.  Streets are just, they were weird.  You didn't get them.  It was kind of like, what's.  Hip hop talk with.  So Carson was trying to find the next thing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And it's definitely different.  But it's not the next thing.  Yeah.  It's not like he found Skrillex. 
[03:38:30]  No, no.  It's like the sounds that at one point they're about to peak, but they never did.  They never quite did.  Yeah.  The story of Carson's life.  But he'll break bands.  Like he broke the killers, break all these bands.  But he's got the voice.  Yeah.  The voice was a stroke of good faith for him because that brought it back.  100 million viewers.  The voice is probably the biggest of those shows.  Yeah.  I mean, over 100 million viewers, they said.  Oh, for the whole season.  I don't think there was ever a time where Carson Daly wasn't cool.  Like I never would see him and be like, oh, he's not cool anymore.  No.  He just kind of went and did his own thing. 
[03:39:00]  For a while.  It just, looking back on it now, it seems like Ryan Seacrest took his spot.  It did.  But I have so much love for, I guess because I was watching MTV so much at that time, that  I just have so much love for Carson Daly in that era.  You have man love for Carson Daly.  No, I just always thought he was cool.  Like he always seemed like you didn't want to like him, but he was cool.  He just knew how to like hang with people.  And you're like, okay.  Like he's hanging with Method Man now.  Yeah.  Like I thought he was kind of douchey when he was with Fred Durst or when he was with 
[03:39:30]  Christina Aguilera.  You're like, oh, fuck that guy.  But then Method Man shows up.  And he can hang.  And Carson's like, oh, what's up, dog?  Bah, bah, bah.  And you're like, oh, Method Man thinks he's cool?  Okay.  M-E-T-H-O-D?  Like him and Fred Durst were boys, too.  So he finds it harder to interview friends.  Like close friends.  Whereas Ryan Seacrest, he don't have any friends.  Well, Ryan's a machine.  I mean, you could throw him at any war show, drop him on the red carpet, and you know he'll  kill it safely for a full hour.  Carson probably has a little bit more personality than Ryan Seacrest, too. 
[03:40:00]  Like Carson Daly's like, you got the impression.  Like you were saying, Troy.  At the party, he'll talk to everybody.  He's a little more cool.  But you're watching him, and you're like, there's a human being.  Right.  Like there's a dude I can relate to.  I want to be like him.  Seacrest is a little more robotic.  Right.  Seacrest is like, oh, yeah, he can host.  Like he doesn't stumble his words.  Right.  Like that's what, when you watch Seacrest, what you get from that is, oh, he knows everybody's  names.  Right.  You know what I mean?  It's not like he's this guy who's like, I want to hear what he's going to say next.  But, I mean, in his defense, too, I mean, he is, he's responsible for the Kardashians 
[03:40:30]  and a bunch of other reality shows, isn't he?  Look, he's been very successful.  I mean, so you have to give the guy credit for that.  Yeah.  His production company has been ridiculously successful.  And now, and also he's got the Dick Clark stuff now, too.  Yeah.  Well, that one, he just.  He fell.  He stepped in.  Yeah.  He knew.  He knew what he was doing.  He's like, let me just sit this one.  And that's more of that robotic sort of space alien, non-human thing.  Because Carson Daly would probably be like, dude, I'm kind of trying to do my own thing.  I'm not really the type of guy who's just going to sit around and wait for this dude  to die so I can take his shit. 
[03:41:00]  But, like, I'm probably just going to try to do me.  And Seacrest is like, hey, Dick.  I'll sit in the cut.  I'm in the cut, dog.  Yeah.  You need a buddy?  I'm your guy.  I'm Ryan Seacrest.  I'm Mr. Safety.  Yeah, but if you want to see a football game, the funnest person is Carson.  Have beer.  Like, he'll pay for everything.  He seems like he'd be fun to hang out with.  Oh, dude.  I mean.  I've never gotten the impression that Seacrest would be fun to hang out with.  No, no.  We threw a big Christmas party, and it was, like, impromptu.  We all were hanging out, drinking, eating.  I think, how much?  Carson goes, fuck that.  Tossed the credit card.  He goes, stay. 
[03:41:30]  Just bring my credit card back at the end of the night.  Carson strikes me as the type of guy that, like, if you were drinking with him or watching  football or whatever, just hanging, after, like, an hour, if he got to like you, he would  tell you about the chicks that he banged.  Yeah.  You think so, right?  Yeah, of course.  And he probably banged tons of them.  Like, in my mind, and Roland, I'm not going to, well, if you want to agree with me, you  can, but in my mind, I'm saying this in my opinion, I think he banged out most of those  teeny bopper chicks.  I would probably think he did.  I mean, you heard the stories, the gossip magazines, they had Carson Daly with Jennifer 
[03:42:00]  Love Hewitt, they had him with Tara Reid, but I got to believe he banged out Britney,  he banged out Christina Aguilera.  Why wouldn't you?  I mean, I would.  He was the man.  I would.  Well, you would have gay sex with Carson Daly?  I'm saying I would have sex with the girls if I were him.  Oh, gotcha.  I mean, you know, in that era, would I smell Carson Daly's fingers?  Yeah.  Of course.  I did.  What's up?  You did.  After who?  What?  Okay.  I think Roland's seen some shit. 
[03:42:30]  Tell me this, Roland.  Yes.  Have you seen some shit?  Without follow-up questions, have you seen some shit?  I've seen enough shit that I see some guests, we still remember each other from that moment.  Really?  Yes.  There'll be an awkward moment where guests will come in.  We'll just smile, like, hey, what's up?  Like, hey.  You're like, eh.  Can you tell me a guest you've had on the show?  You don't have to tell me what the moment was.  Can you tell me a guest we've had on the show that there has been some, like, acknowledgement  of, oh, yeah, I was there for those days?  I wouldn't say the guest's name, though.  You won't? 
[03:43:00]  No.  Okay.  Because he's coming back next year.  He is?  Yes.  Who's coming back next year?  You know you some of it.  I tell you everything, yeah.  Well, I just don't know what's safe to say or not, and I don't want to put your job in  jeopardy.  I know, but...  I mean, part of Roland's job is harboring these relationships, so I've got to figure out here  as we talk which relationships Roland doesn't mind blowing up.  Yeah, because he knows too much, Sam.  Right, but I don't talk, do I?  No, no.  That's why I trust you.  I'm like you, Roland.  I'll ask questions.  Yeah.  A lot of questions. 
[03:43:30]  But you ask questions why I have the key to my vault in my hands.  You have the key?  Oh, meaning you'll unlock it at any moment?  No, with my booze.  Oh.  Speaking of boozing, did you hear about what happened over this past Friday?  No.  Did you talk about it?  You didn't talk about it?  Oh, no, I didn't.  What happened on Friday?  Well, Roland, the party animal, he was fucking out in full effect.  You know what?  I saw on Roland's Instagram, it's...  Well, I'm not Sam.  Troy is Troy Kwan, and Roland is Rolando's 99. 
[03:44:00]  All on Instagram.  I...  And my Instagram is fairly terrible.  I just post pictures like every few days.  Troy does all his...  Like, he's Mr. Lower East Side pictures of graffiti and, you know, guys on skateboards or whatever.  And Roland is...  He's either tourist dude or on the weekends he's party guy with his Instagram.  Yeah.  And I saw...  And I'm glad you brought that up, Troy.  Yes.  Because I saw somebody that looked familiar on Roland's Instagram.  Yes.  A certain blonde.  Yeah. 
[03:44:30]  Was that who it was?  Yeah.  Were you out...  Was he at your place?  I was DJing last Friday.  Uh-huh.  Where?  At Los Feliz.  Oh.  Lower East Side.  And when Roland comes in to Los Feliz, they roll out the red carpet for him.  And why is that?  Because they love him.  How do they know Roland?  Well, our friend Katie, Katie Storm...  Oh, that's the one we blew up her Twitter that time for no reason.  Yeah.  Katie Storm on Twitter.  She loves Roland, and she runs the place.  So she just rolls out the red carpet for him.  Oh.  So whatever Roland wants, he doesn't have to wait in lines. 
[03:45:00]  He just comes right in.  This is what's crazy to me.  Like, we do all these things that I think are just...  We're just fucking around for fun.  I don't get any of these perks.  Because you go home.  Yeah, you don't come out.  If you came out, you'd get the red carpet rolled out.  You think so?  Yeah, absolutely.  But Roland comes in like big motherfucking pimp.  Rolls in, no lines, just cuts right in.  It's like, what do you want?  Whatever he wants.  For free.  And let me ask you this.  When he went to Los Feliz, I saw a picture of him in a blonde. 
[03:45:30]  Did he roll in there with Jesse May Peluso, who's been on the after show before?  Yeah.  You did?  Yeah.  You dog.  No, she was in the area.  She was like, hey, what are you doing?  Los Feliz.  And they rolled in with some other chick that was really hot.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  You rolled in with two hot chicks.  Yeah.  You know how to make an entrance.  And Jesse May looked hot as fuck.  She was hilarious.  She fucked around with so many dudes, like messing with her minds.  Well, Roland knows.  That's hilarious.  Like, even if Roland isn't necessarily trying to bang Jesse May, I don't know if he is  or not.  She has a funny comedy guy. 
[03:46:00]  She does?  She has a boyfriend?  Giannis.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  So even though you're just bringing her as like your buddy, and bringing another  hot chick is your buddy, if you can roll into a bar with a couple hot chicks, right there  your credibility is raised.  Sure.  Because there are a lot of girls that will be like, well, I mean, he's very strange.  Like, he's exceptionally a strange man.  Yeah.  But, if you rolled in with those two girls, obviously girls like him, so I guess I'll  like him.  Yeah.  It's pretty simple.  And they were doing an excessive amount of tequila shots. 
[03:46:30]  Oh, yeah.  Who you were, Roland?  And Jesse May?  Well, Jesse May goes, tequila!  And then, like, I think I blacked, like, the lost count after the ninth, tenth one.  You had ten tequila shots?  More.  Oh, no.  Then we went to another place, yeah.  Where'd you go after that?  I don't remember that.  You don't have that memory.  No.  Well, I remember, like, she pulled her groin because she jumped.  Who did?  Jesse May.  Jesse May Peluso.  Yeah, because she was doing karate kicks everywhere.  And, like, she'll.  Because she was doing karate kicks everywhere. 
[03:47:00]  What was she doing?  Wasn't this, like, a crowded place?  She didn't care.  Like, she goes, watch.  Look at this guy.  I'm going to fake hit on him, and I'm just going to treat him like shit, and he'll still  give me a drink.  And she did it.  Wow.  Those are the girls affectionately known as bitches in the club.  It's hilarious, though.  She's hysterical.  Really?  Out there, she's just a fucking.  She was dancing.  The guy was dancing, and then she started, like, licking herself.  She was licking herself?  Like, licking her hands, and she went, ah, or, like, started growling.  Oh, so she was purposely acting like a crazy lunatic. 
[03:47:30]  Yeah, and the guy was still, like, hanging in there, and then she started sniffing the guy's  girlfriend's hair.  And then they left.  They left Los Feliz, and they went somewhere else.  Him and the two chicks?  Yeah, and then he's posting pictures of her on a stripper pole.  What would happen with that?  Oh, I saw those.  Yeah, you had Jessie May Palouse on a stripper pole.  It was at the next bar, wherever we went to, and she pushed whoever was on there, and  she started just twirling, and then she, that thing, that's when she pulled her groin, because  she jumped on it.  Maybe not the karate kicks?  Well, you had karate kicks, and then you, that, on top of that. 
[03:48:00]  Sure.  She went crazy.  Yeah.  Oh, my gosh.  But Rollin'  She's a party girl.  Yeah.  She seems like she's a lot of fun.  I was fortunate I was DJing, because I didn't get a chance to really hang with her too much.  You and Jess, you would howl with laughter.  She's fucking hilarious.  But I gotta, we gotta get her back in here.  We got some stuff to talk about.  Yeah.  To party with her, it's a lot of fun.  If you, from what you remember.  Yeah.  And then the next day, I couldn't move.  Did she drink like you drink?  She drinks more than I drink.  Really?  Yeah.  Did she handle it better? 
[03:48:30]  No, because I said, we gotta get pizza.  She goes, fuck the pizza.  I said, just get pizza.  And then she texted me later, thank God for the pizza.  I would've died.  How crowded was this place?  It's crowded.  Los Feliz was packed.  It was wall to wall when we were there.  And Jessie Mae's doing karate kicks?  Yeah.  Yeah, she was going nuts.  And she's like, yeah!  She's got some legs on her too.  Yeah, but they should run into a guy.  And then the guy will turn around.  She goes, hi!  Like, smiling.  And the guy turns around.  She goes, gives them the finger when they don't know looking.  So she just gets a kick out of guys having no clue, like, which direction she's coming from. 
[03:49:00]  Yeah, no clue.  Like, she goes, oh my God, those are hot clothes.  And then she goes, what happened?  The gap was open yesterday.  And the guy goes, no, they're from.  She goes, shut up!  And starts dancing.  See, people aren't used to girls like her out there.  No.  Like, girls who really don't give a fuck?  Right.  Because girls are always trying to, like, be, like, impress.  Right.  Like, they're always, they're, every girl tends to go out and tries to uphold an image.  They're too worried about what other people think about them.  Right.  Instead of just letting loose. 
[03:49:30]  She just doesn't give a fuck.  And the guys are used to being in that mode where they're trying to impress girls too.  So when a girl starts throwing shit at them that they don't understand.  When girls are wittier than guys, it just kind of throws them off, like, what the hell's going on?  There's like that, there's one guy, I call him the Brad Pitt guy, his ad ripped up.  And he goes, can I buy you a drink?  She goes, you will?  I don't want your fucking drink.  And the guy was so confused the whole night.  He kind of walked into her and goes, hey, what's up?  She goes, oh my god.  And she goes, why don't you call your boyfriend? 
[03:50:00]  He goes, no, no, I don't have one.  She goes, get out of my way, you asshole.  Start dancing around him.  Just confused him the whole night.  Is that what she does, though?  So she has a boyfriend.  Yeah.  So now she just gets off on going to clubs and just confusing guys.  It's the funniest thing I've ever seen.  It really is.  Just fucking with people.  I was howling with Laster.  It was like the best thing ever.  And you were watching her from the DJ booth?  Yeah.  Yeah, just like, what the fuck is going on?  Is she coming in like a tornado?  Like a tornado.  She's dancing.  Her and Roland are dancing with other people.  It was just like, what the hell is going on? 
[03:50:30]  We just confused everybody.  You guys are taking over that club.  Yeah.  Like, everybody who just comes to that club to go, they're like, what is this place?  She danced with a guy.  And then I was with my girlfriend and I started dancing with her girlfriend.  And then she was like, why are you dancing with me?  And I was like, what?  It's just confusing everybody.  I hope Jesse May's boyfriend is listening.  He's hilarious.  I like that guy.  Because it's gift-giving season.  Oh.  You know that?  And a girl like that, you got to make sure she stays with you.  You need a gift that's fast, affordable, and it has to be a gift that Jesse May is going to love forever.  Mrs. Filts?  Here's, no.

[03:53:00]  Single man.  Really?  Yep.  So what are you doing with Christmas?  I don't know.  You don't have a girl that you're going to see for the holidays?  No.  Buy my mom something nice.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I know what your mom wants.  Barry Manilow.  Some of that dick is what your mom wants.  That's what's up.  So you're not dating.  Are you gay?  No.  Okay.  I mean, that's a fair question to ask.  Fair enough.  But you're not dating?  No.  Why is that?  I don't know.  You're just a single guy living it up in the city?  Yeah.  Give the New York girls some dick. 
[03:53:30]  Huh?  Giving the New York girls the dick.  Are you giving...  That's a great question that Roland brought to the table.  Yeah.  Are you giving New York girls the dick?  Absolutely.  Yours?  Yeah.  I actually have to give props to Troy one time.  Troy actually hooked it up at the club.  He gave you some dick?  Well, you know, they made the certain arrangements.  Oh.  Oh.  Provided the musical entertainment.  Yeah.  It wasn't a prostitution thing.  No, no.  The way Sal just described it, it sounded very much...  Yeah.  No, I did not get him a hooker.  You didn't?  No.  You just invited him to the club you were with.  But Troy was killing it, though, that night.  Yeah.  I saw the music.  Everybody was doing it. 
[03:54:00]  I don't even like dancing, but Troy did a really good job.  Now...  Well, it's so crowded, though.  You could just move back and forth.  It looks like you're dancing.  Have you?  That's why you like it.  Oh, fuck yeah.  Plus, you get to watch Jesse May Peluso karate kick.  Yeah.  You get to pull her groin.  And pull her groin.  Has Sal been back to party with you?  No.  No, I mean, he's come out to the club and hung out out there.  No, that's what I mean.  Has he been back to the club?  He's been out two or three times, I think.  Yeah, something like that.  Yeah.  Just every now and then? 
[03:54:30]  Yeah, it's fun.  Special occasions?  Yeah, it's a lot of fun.  A lot of girls?  A lot of girls.  A lot of horny girls.  Do they come horny?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, my God.  They're fucking...  Tell me about it, Sal.  How horny are these girls?  Crazy.  Yeah?  Made it too easy.  Wow.  Rolling horny?  I don't...  I just don't see that side.  See, Roland has a problem because he just gets obliterated drunk.  Like, he...  I become the machine.  He passes the point of, like, this is acceptable for anyone.  Yeah.  And he's just there to act ridiculous.  Right.  But he's allowed to there because...  Well, that's his spot. 
[03:55:00]  It's his spot.  And everybody loves him.  Like, all the managers, all the girls that work there, they love him.  It's like, cheers.  He walks in.  Roland!  What do you need?  Yeah, what do you need, buddy?  And when I, like, sell scores, I'm, like, fucking with other people.  You don't drink that much.  You don't drink, like, Roland drinks.  Oh, yeah.  You do?  Oh, yeah.  You get that fucked up and still get girls?  Yeah.  Yeah, but he's quiet, though.  I'm loud.  Yeah, me and Roland, yeah.  We're the opposite.  Roland did a fucking cab screaming at anything and anyone. 
[03:55:30]  Right.  The cab driver.  The cab driver.  It's a guy driving him.  And then I...  Big, you know, you know, Brock-looking dudes, like...  In the next car, I screamed and challenged him to a fight.  Yeah.  You do?  Yeah, and then I told the cab driver, go, go, go!  And then next week, some shit may go down.  Why do you say that?  Because Roland and I will both be in Las Vegas at the exact same time.  No.  Yes.  Yeah.  That's a disaster.  That is a disaster.  I mean, you live in the city and you have Roland pissing in phone booths.  Did you hear that show?  Roland pissed in a phone booth one time. 
[03:56:00]  It's on my Instagram.  You can see the pictures.  The evidence.  Yeah.  You guys are going to Vegas together?  Yeah.  Well, he's going to be out there.  I'm going to be out there as well.  It's a coincidence.  You're not traveling together.  No.  No, I'm going out to Cali, but we're going to see...  I'm going to see Diplo, who's one of my favorite DJs.  He's out there at XS.  So, I'm going out and Roland's like, oh, I'm going out.  And so, it's like, we're going to hook up some VIP.  We're going to have some fun.  Oh, my God.  So...  Are you both ready for it?  I think that...  I mean...  Vegas.  Yeah, you guys both party hard.  Yeah.  Roland...  This is going to take shit to a whole new level. 
[03:56:30]  Yeah.  Are you going to film it?  Are you going to take photos?  I mean, if it's not incriminating in any way.  Yeah, I was thinking that.  I mean, it'd be fun in a way to, you know, get some video or something.  But a lot of that stuff you probably don't want to capture.  No, I mean, I'll capture some moments that will get posted that I'm sure will be good,  but...  I mean, Cleveland, you guys were out of control.  Cleveland was fun.  Like, Cleveland was stories that...  We came back and we told some stories, and we came back and there were some stories we  didn't tell.  Right.  You know what I mean?  So...  And that's Cleveland.  Yeah.  So, what is Vegas getting us? 
[03:57:00]  And Vegas is like, I got VIP hooked up for some spots, Roland's hooking up some shit.  Wasn't that your town, Roland?  Yeah.  Because you went to UNLV.  So, you know everyone there.  Yeah, I have to reconnect with some of the people, but yeah, they're still, they're spread  out at different casinos.  It's dangerous.  You have no idea what's about to go down.  You're bringing your chick, though.  Yeah, but she doesn't give a fuck.  She's down to party.  She's ready.  She's crazier than me.  And are you going to get a girl for Roland?  Well, I mean, I don't know.  We'll see what happens.  Bitch every night.  That's what I'm saying.  Mad bitches every night. 
[03:57:30]  Sal, when are you finally going to settle down?  When am I going to finally settle down?  Yeah.  I don't know.  I mean, Troy, you know, Troy was able to find a girl that, like, even though he lives  this partying lifestyle, he still has a chick.  She's crazier than me, though.  But she, because she matches, like, she compliments you.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  And that works.  And that's what I mean.  You know, Roland.  Roland's just a ladies' man.  Yeah, but he also tends to go overboard with the drinking, making himself impossible  to be around for a female. 
[03:58:00]  Yeah, I mean, but somehow, girls still love him.  Yeah, girls love him.  But once I hit a certain point, the taint takes over.  The taint?  The taint.  The taint.  Did you just say so, this taint?  He thinks with his taint.  What is the taint taking over?  I don't know.  Smell it.  What's that?  You don't have any girls on the horizon?  Nothing?  Nothing.  All right.  You know.  It's too bad.  Mark this, Eric.  Why?  I don't know.  I just said Mark.  You think it could be a moment in history for Sam? 
[03:58:30]  Moment of history.  Well.  But yeah, Vegas is going to get ugly.  Yeah.  You think so?  Yeah.  I might do the baptism.  What's the baptism?  When I used to get drunk in college, I go to the fountain, dip my head in the water  and pull it back and go, I've been baptized.  He jumped in the fountain at the Bellagio, didn't he?  Yeah.  That was a bet.  You jumped in the fountain at the Bellagio?  Yeah.  It was one of those.  We were there for some shoot.  And I got.  A shoot?  A shoot.  Oh.  A shoot.  A shoot.  A TV taping.  Ah. 
[03:59:00]  And Carson goes, everybody will go bring out the tank.  All his celebrity buddies were there.  And this is the tank.  Not Frank.  Because sometimes you're Frank the taint.  Sometimes you're Frank the tank.  This is the tank.  Okay.  And they go, bring him out.  Now, why do they call you Frank the tank if your name is Roland?  Because I plow through everything when I run drunk.  I just think Roland the tank would be better.  Yeah.  All they say is the tank.  Some old school, isn't it?  Yeah.  Yeah, because I always run through everything. 
[03:59:30]  So they go, look.  Carson goes, look.  There goes a tank just plowing through.  Breaking things.  Destroying property and laughing.  So that's why he nicknamed me the tank.  He goes, you just didn't give a shit.  You just keep on going.  Didn't or don't?  I don't give a shit.  Right, right, right.  So then we got wasted at this club.  And then we're walking out.  And I saw the Bellagio fountains going.  And I go, oh my god.  In my head, it'll be hilarious.  Put my foot there and shoot it the other way.  Okay.  So you're thinking you're wasted.  Beyond. 
[04:00:00]  And you see the Bellagio fountain.  And I guess that's the big fountain.  Is that in Casino?  Yeah.  That's the big fountain that shoots up.  Yeah.  And you're thinking jets that shoot up.  And in your head, you're thinking, if you put your foot down.  And I know it sounds like I'm being repetitive.  But nobody understood that.  So we have to make it clear for everybody.  In your head, you thought it would be a good idea to put your foot down on the jet.  And that way, it would spray everywhere.  Yes.  Like when you put your thumb over a hose.  Yes, exactly.  Precisely. 
[04:00:30]  And then what happened?  I'd say, hey, guys, hold up.  Watch.  And then they're just talking.  And before.  And who were you with?  Um, Carson and all his celebrity friends.  You were with Carson Daly.  Can you name me, like, a couple of the celebrity friends?  Without incriminating what they were doing.  Just there.  Just that they were there.  They were there.  Just that they saw you do it.  They saw me do it.  Like who?  Like, what's one of them?  The initials is JT.  Okay.  And this was what year?  Is it, like, I have to say they're... 
[04:01:00]  Like 99-ish?  It's like 2000, 2001-ish.  And, like, after you did this, did this JT person say bye-bye-bye?  Uh, I don't know.  Okay, go on.  So I go, hey, guys.  So he's bringing sexy back.  I said, hey, guys.  Well, look at me.  And they were still talking.  And all I heard was, what's he doing?  And they all turned around and went, no.  I was already knee-deep in the fountain.  Just shooting through.  I was on the mission.  And then, uh, right before I got near the jets, when it turned on, the security tackled me in the water. 
[04:01:30]  In the water?  Yeah.  Security had to jump in the water and tackle you?  There's, like, five of them, yeah.  That's how quick they come out.  Carson Daly and JT and some other celebrities, whoever that JT is, are all watching you.  Yeah, to me.  No!  Why?  Why were you not allowed to do that?  Um, apparently it's illegal in Vegas.  To jump in fountains?  Yeah.  And then I was, I was going to be arrested, but, uh, since, uh, they finagled my way out of it. 
[04:02:00]  They nagled your way out of it?  Yeah, finagled.  Oh, oh.  So I wasn't arrested.  I just told, um, I wasn't allowed on the property for the remainder of the year.  For the remainder of the year.  You got on the blacklist.  Yeah.  You got, like, in Casino.  Everything I know about Vegas is based on the movie Casino.  It's true, yeah.  So they said, we prefer if you don't come to property and make an ass of yourself.  Don Rickles came out, and he grabbed you.  No, I wish it was just him.  No, it was a big guy who dragged me through.  Why did security have to tackle you?  Like, why was it that serious?  Because they said if you put your foot in the fountain, it would cut her right off. 
[04:02:30]  The fountain would have cut your foot off?  Because of the pressure?  It could cut, slice it.  Oh, my God.  Because the jet streams are, because they shoot up all the way into the sky.  Yeah.  And that's why Carson and his friends were yelling, no!  And then that's when they get, the guy, the security guy goes, are you a fucking idiot?  I went, no, I'm just drunk.  Can I tell you something?  I knew that by the end of today's after show, we would get one safe story out of Rowan.  That's a safe story.  That's a super safe story, yeah.  And that's why I was, for some reason, when I get drunk, I run through fountains. 
[04:03:00]  I have a habit.  See, for me...  In Chicago, you saw it.  Yeah, and you weren't even that drunk.  No.  For me, actually, I don't think you were drunk at all.  You were sober, if I remember.  But you challenged me.  But, no, you said, should I run through the fountain?  And I said, yeah.  I know.  I'd just love to.  See, for me, if I was about to run through a fountain and then was tackled by a security  guard who informed me that had I done what I planned to do, my foot would have been cut  off, that wouldn't lead me to believe, so now I just always run through fountains. 
[04:03:30]  That would lead me to say, so now I don't run through fountains anymore.  I just don't run through fountains with jet streams.  Do you know if they have jet streams?  Yeah, if it goes...  How about if you're intoxicated?  I don't know.  Then you're not quite sure.  His judgment goes right out the window.  It does, right?  Yeah.  And my head's like, this is going to be the best time ever.  Whee!  And there's a good chance that in Vegas, Roland will be intoxicated?  I certainly hope so.  I know that I will be joining him.  Good for you.  Well, I can't wait to hear about it.  It's going to be good. 
[04:04:00]  And this is happening Christmas week?  Before.  Yeah, it's going to happen next weekend, I think.  Next?  Like this coming weekend?  No, the following.  Oh, so the weekend before Christmas.  Yeah, we're heading out there the 20th, 21st.  So if you're in Vegas and want to party, let us know.  You won't be able to miss them.  You don't even have to give a location.  No.  You'll hear me screamy.  You'll hear two guys yelling, bro, what's up, bro?  Look in Vegas for Troy and Roland, and you'll find them.  We're going to be on a warpath.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Tearing shit up.  2012 has been a crazy fucking year. 
[04:04:30]  I might shit my pants.  I don't know.  It's time to let loose.  Roland's making the announcement now.  I might shit my pants.  I don't know.  I hope he does.  I hope he, because he's saying you might rent a tux.  Yeah.  Why?  Because, well, pimp style.  He's going to shit in a tux.  And it's December 21st?  20th.  Yeah, 2021.  Diplo's the 21st.  That's the Mayan calendar.  Right?  Yeah.  12, 21, 12?  We're bringing out the fucking world with a bang.  And it's strong, fellas.  And it's strong.  All right.  I'm going to talk to you guys maybe more about this tomorrow. 
[04:05:00]  Ryan and Fez are coming up next, so stay tuned for that.  And we'll be back tomorrow.  Goodbye, everybody.  The Opie and Anthony show is now over.  For real this time. </pre>
