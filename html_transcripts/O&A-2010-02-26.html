<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a “Snow Day” theme, driven by a major blizzard hitting the tri-state area.  Opie and Anthony, along with staff members Sam, Travis, Danny, Butcha, and E-Rock, recounted their own struggles commuting to the studio.  Executive producer Steve Carlesi’s valiant (and ultimately unsuccessful) attempt to travel 100 feet from his home became a running joke, contrasting sharply with Chris (Kenny's replacement), who impressively plowed his driveway three times and braved the snow in a rear-wheel-drive vehicle. Numerous listener calls detailed their own harrowing snow-day experiences.  The hosts interspersed these stories with discussions of unrelated news:  New York Governor David Paterson’s impending removal from office, Charlie Rangel’s ethical scandals, and the death of actor Andrew Koenig, including a humorous anecdote about his parents abruptly leaving a scheduled Larry King interview.  They also previewed their upcoming “We Are the World” parody and discussed the Vancouver Olympics, specifically the controversies surrounding athlete celebrations. The entire segment was peppered with profanity and sexually explicit humor.


The show transitioned into a lengthy, rambling mock war between the US and Canada, filled with exaggerated and offensive banter about the respective military capabilities of both nations.  A caller, Eric from Jersey, initiated a discussion on the psychological significance of bronze medals.  This segued into the hosts' plans to attend an upcoming UFC fight and the possibility of having fighters like Frank Mir as guests.  Michelle, a female caller, defended her hockey knowledge and expressed frustration with game times, further fueling the absurd US military superiority discussions involving grenades and hockey slap shots. Anthony then described his viewing of figure skating, offering crude and sexually suggestive commentary on the skaters' appearances and the announcers' reactions.  The hosts continued to make comments about the bodies of figure and speed skaters.

A significant portion focused on the debut of the Opie and Anthony version of "We Are the World."  They hyped the production, emphasizing its length and the participation of numerous show regulars and characters, including Uncle Paul, Ted Sheckler, Lyle Lovett, and others, highlighting the use of auto-tune. The song was played, followed by listener feedback ranging from praise to disdain. The hosts discussed the creation process, technical challenges, and listener reactions, mentioning Ahmad Ali's remote participation from Vancouver.

The broadcast concluded with another segment heavily featuring the comedic song, focusing on the improvisational contributions of Chip and jokingly contrasting the hosts’ minimal effort with that of others involved. A caller recounted finding the song hilarious at work, risking job repercussions.   The segment then returned to the death of Andrew Koenig, son of Walter Koenig. The hosts discussed the unexpected absence of Walter and his wife from their scheduled Vancouver interview.  The remainder was a darkly comedic, irreverent riff on Koenig's death, using puns, Star Trek references, and obscene jokes related to "Boner."  The hosts repeatedly and sarcastically used the phrase "unbeknownst to anyone" regarding the missing guests.  Multiple mock Larry King interviews, incorporating Star Trek references and sexually explicit innuendo, were interspersed with the jokes.  A listener called in to express discomfort with the humor, eliciting a brief, unconcerned apology from the hosts.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Opie and Anthony are no strangers in a scandal.  Opie and Anthony on satellite radio shows host Anthony Kamiya and Greg Opie.  Universal team, Opie and Anthony apologizing for yet another approach.  Common profanity link left.  Is this the last straw for the watching radio duo?  I have a raging heart on it.  Let me tell you something about this radio show you listen to.  We are really good.  Yeah, man, we hang out, we gonna be all wet.  Yeah, man. 
[00:00:30]  We know when we suck, we know when we're great, but we do like when you say how great we are.  Holy shit!  Oh my good golly!  We're broadcasting again.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Ah, good morning.  Wow, good morning, everybody.  I'm calling it right now.  Yeah?  Snow Day!  Yeah!  Snow Day!  You haven't done a Snow Day show yet, Anthony.  No.  Snow Day shows are the funnest Opie and Anthony shows that we could do. 
[00:01:00]  The bestest ever.  The bestest ever, because guess what?  What?  It's a I don't give a fuck day on the Opie and Anthony show.  Exactly.  Snow Day!  Did we take roll call?  You want to take roll call?  Oh, and a roll call.  Sound off now.  Sam!  Here.  Travis!  Present.  Saget!  Oh, shit!  I mean, Johnny Weir.  Oh!  I mean...  What's your name again? 
[00:01:30]  Oh.  What?  Sean.  Sean the intern.  Sean the intern made it.  And he doesn't even get paid to be here.  No.  Keep the roll call going, Anthony.  You know what the good thing is, though?  He could walk right on top of the snow.  He's so light and dainty that his feet don't even slip through the snow.  It's like ice skating.  For him, yes, it is like ice skating.  Like Johnny Weir.  Like Johnny Weir.  Exactly.  How about Danny?  He's down the hall.  He just made it in, though.  But he made it.  Yay!  Butcha! 
[00:02:00]  Butcha made it.  Yay!  Um...  E-Rock.  E-Rock!  Made it.  Yay!  Uh...  Steve Carleesi!  Hold on.  Hold on.  Wait for it.  Wait for it.  Wait for it.  Wait for it.  We're tanks for nothing! 
[00:02:30]  Yeah, the executive producer of the Opie and Anthony show had a real tough time getting  in.  For the rest of America, it's a goddamn mess in the tri-state area.  Yeah.  It is awful out there.  Yes.  I mean, it really is.  It is probably one of the worst winter storms we've seen in quite some time.  And we just had a winter storm, like a blizzard-type winter storm. 
[00:03:00]  But it was, I don't know, it was kind of just like a lot of snow, and it was kind of  fun.  This is wind, like sleet, snow.  Death.  Death, destruction.  I almost fell twice just walking here.  But I said, that's because you're an old man.  So you can't really...  Old man.  And my intoxication.  Yeah.  No, I was walking, and it is so icy under the snow.  It's not like you're walking on crunchy, nice snow.  It's horrendous.  The roads are slippery and icy. 
[00:03:30]  Well, because it started as rain, then it went to heavy snow, which took down a lot of  trees so far.  A guy was killed in Central Park walking around yesterday.  You're kidding.  Afternoon.  How is it?  Then another tree fell on a city bus.  It is just a disaster out there.  We don't even have to be here.  That's why it's snow day.  I'm not even supposed to be here today.  But...  I'm not even supposed to be.  But Steve started emailing everybody at what?  4, 4.30?  Steve Carlesi's day off again. 
[00:04:00]  Didn't we do that then?  Yeah, we're going to have to redo it, I guess.  Yeah.  Stupid Steve didn't make it in.  No, he sent me an email.  And wait till you hear what Kenny's replacement did to get in here today.  Because that story is nothing less than fucking...  Like, he should get the Congressional Medal of Honor.  Here's Steve's subject line.  Who is going to have problems slash delays getting in? 
[00:04:30]  And he goes, and I'm stuck.  Made it about 100 feet down the road.  This sucks.  And then Steve Carlesi.  He wrote that from his bed.  Yeah, yeah.  100 feet down the road.  It wasn't snowing where I was.  But then 100 feet away.  My goodness.  A blizzard.  Yeah, no one goes 100 feet.  100 feet.  You either don't go at all.  Or you go all the way, right?  Yes. 
[00:05:00]  You don't just go 100 feet.  My Prius only went 100 feet.  And the battery died.  I swear to you.  I gave it my all.  I gave it to try.  Uh, yes, Sam.  Another roll call announcement?  Yes.  Love Buzz is here.  Love Buzz!  Interns that don't even get paid made it in.  Yes.  But Steve, the executive producer of the Open Anthony Show.  I made it to 100 feet.  Wait.  I'm checking in.  I've made it 110 feet. 
[00:05:30]  I'll be there in July.  Like, Steve should be the only one here today.  Only one here or only one not here.  Sam made it all the way from, I don't know where the fuck he lives.  Way out in the woods somewhere.  Well, uh, Sam and Travis made an interesting, um, they had an insightful little, uh, thing  on this whole snow transportation thing.  What was it?  Uh, choo-choo go in snow.  Choo-choo go in snow.  So as long as you can get to a choo-choo.  Yeah.  You can make it into work. 
[00:06:00]  And in the city, choo-choo's pretty available.  Well, I don't know about that.  In Jersey, choo-choo.  It's not like this is the greatest city in the whole damn world.  Oh, with one of the biggest subway systems?  Right.  Oh, fucking Steve.  Hey, Danny Ross!  Hey!  Yeah, Danny's in!  I'll tell you, I almost didn't make it in.  It is insane.  We're not saying it's not ugly out there.  Oh, yeah.  Dude, I thought about turning around about three or four times.  Insane, right?  And I hit that point of no return, and I was just like, you made it this far, dude.  You just gotta go.  But see, you have to come in on these days because it's a snow day show. 
[00:06:30]  Snow day.  Remember the last snow day show?  We had Jimmy and E-Rock running around the place.  And bunny outfit or whatever.  And pink bunny outfits.  Sam, it's the hoodie footie snuggle suit.  Yeah.  Hoodie footie snuggle suit.  So we gotta find more fun.  Sam, it's your job to make this snow day special.  Yes.  Well, we'll still be able to debut We Are The World today.  Yes, we will.  The snow isn't affecting the debut of the We Are The World song?  As long as Troy Kwan figures out the choo-choo.  Oh, shit.  What?  He did? 
[00:07:00]  Troy Kwan!  Troy Kwan!  So it's gonna end up the only one that didn't make it is the executive producer?  Oh, boy.  That's not good.  Oh, my God.  That's not good.  I mean, you know how I don't like to defend Steve ever?  But, I mean, he does drive the most faggotiest car on the face of the earth.  He certainly does.  With strange defense.  With that, Danny, I'm about to tell my story.  Well, first, let me just say...  Which isn't gonna help Steve at all.  Janine just wrote,  And that's how you executive excuse.  Very good. 
[00:07:30]  Also, E-Rock was already able to drive in from Jersey,  so I don't think in a snowstorm more than one person can drive in from Jersey.  Can drive in.  I think that's the problem.  Well, that's where the wall of snow must have fallen 100 feet from his house.  Right behind E-Rock.  Fuck all that.  Kenny and Jimmy did make it to Cleveland.  They were delayed like three or four hours.  They finally flew out yesterday,  so Jimmy will be at the House of Blues in Cleveland,  so let's get that out of the way.  Yes.  So, when Kenny's not here,  he has this guy, Chris, who replaces him.  Yep. 
[00:08:00]  And Chris is probably the nicest guy I've ever met in my life.  I mean, he is like...  That isn't even an exaggeration.  He is so nice, so mellow.  Nothing bothers this guy.  He's about to kill somebody.  Yeah.  That's how bad it is outside.  So, when Steve wrote that he made it 100 feet,  and then he said, screw this, and gave up.  Well, Chris's story is a little different.  Here he is coming down the hall.  Yeah.  Chris told...  I don't know if he's lying on the air.  Chris told me that to make sure that he was going to be able to come in today, 
[00:08:30]  he plowed his driveway three times.  Now, he lives in, I think...  He can't be on the air probably, right?  I don't know.  Where do you live?  Northern Jersey?  Yeah, he lives...  Yeah, yeah.  He lives north.  He lives in the place that just got pounded by this.  There's over two feet of snow where you live.  Yeah.  Two feet of snow.  Easily, right?  Yeah.  Okay, so he's coming from an area that's gotten two feet of snow.  In New York right now, we're up to about nine. 
[00:09:00]  Nine inches.  Yeah, and it's...  So west and north are where it's just completely a disaster.  No sign of stopping either, by the way.  No.  So he...  He...  Well, Steve's on the line.  Jesus Christ.  Oh, no.  Hold on a minute.  You're messing up my story.  I apologize.  I just wanted to call in and give the faggot incompetent executive producer reasoning for not being there.  Oh, I thought we were doing a good job of that. 
[00:09:30]  No, no.  You were doing a horrible misrepresentation.  Oh.  So, Steve, why can't you make it in even though everybody else on the Opie and Anthony staff made it in?  Dude, if I live...  I saw...  How did he not...  The audience saw it coming.  The audience saw that coming.  Dope and I!  Dope and I!  Yes.  Oh, shit.  I ain't listening to his horseshit today. 
[00:10:00]  Dude, I saw LOLs popping up on this screen when you started asking the question.  Fuck that.  Holy motherfuckers.  See, Pete, money.  Here's why.  See, if you...  He's so pissed off right now.  Oh, he's freaking out.  If you have a desire to be here, you make it in somehow, some way.  Yes.  Just like everybody on staff did.  Now, Chris, who's filling in for Kenny, he knew it was going to be a disaster.  So, he told me he plowed his driveway or shoveled his driveway three times before he went to bed. 
[00:10:30]  Just to make sure.  He woke up this morning, there was another foot of snow on his driveway.  So, I think he told me he got up around two in the morning.  So, basically, the guy pulled an all-nighter to make sure he made it in.  He shovels a foot, and he's getting paid shit.  I mean, shit.  So, he shovels the driveway again, a whole foot of snow. 
[00:11:00]  And then he gets in his non-four-wheel drive, piece-of-shit car.  It's like a regular type, you know.  It's horrendous.  Like a...  What is it?  Like a Crown Vic?  Or something?  One of those big, can't-handle-the-snow-in-any-way.  That's the sound it makes in the snow.  If you want to know the car he drove in this blizzard, I just happened to make a quick TwitVid.  So, if you go to my Twitter, OP Radio, it's my latest posting. 
[00:11:30]  You'll see when I said...  I said something like, well, I made it to work, whatever.  And I kind of pan, and you see a car kind of going down the road.  It's a white car.  You'll see it in the video.  That's Chris's car.  It has no business being on the road right now.  No business.  Back-wheel drive.  Huh?  Yeah, rear-wheel drive is just horrible.  So, he...  Yeah, so...  Was that the video?  Did you see it?  God damn, what a mess.  Right in the beginning. 
[00:12:00]  Yeah, is it that white car that kind of drove by?  Yeah, white car.  Yeah.  Yeah, that was just awful.  Trust me, it's not going to...  This fucking video ain't going to win any awards.  When it turns...  There's Chris's car right there.  That's what he drove in.  No four-wheel drive.  And he said, I left my house at 3.05.  3.05...  He left his house at 3.05 a.m.  And made it to my building around 5.15.  Yeah.  I think it's only a half-hour ride usually.  Yep.  It took him over two hours, and there's no one on the road. 
[00:12:30]  Yeah.  There's no one on the road.  He picked me up.  He was seething, dude.  Yeah.  And he's the nicest guy.  I know.  And then it didn't help when we're driving to work, and all of a sudden his phone goes  off.  I go, that's got to be Kenny, because Kenny's obsessive about everything.  Of course.  Kenny probably woke his ass up just so he could check on Chris to make sure Chris was driving  me in and taking care of Anthony and blah, blah, blah.  Chris saw freaking the text message from Kenny.  I thought he was going to throw his phone out into the snow. 
[00:13:00]  All Kenny wrote was, did you make it?  Oh, no.  After all that shit, he's got to look at Kenny's stupid text.  Right.  They're a joke.  And everyone has a story on how brutal it was to make it in here today.  I mean, Sam had to get a train in.  Danny had to drive in.  I had to walk a block.  And Anthony almost broke a hip walking a block.  I was staying at the hotel.  It's really bad, though.  By the way, which I'm not making any illusions here, which is the only reason I'm here today 
[00:13:30]  and not one of the people being goofed on.  There's a hundred feet of snow.  I stayed, yeah, because I stayed in the city last night and was able to just walk one block.  And I looked out the hotel window and was thinking about it.  I walked to the lobby, looked out the door.  It's just hell on earth.  Well, thank God you made it in, because we do have a boss that's kind of a douche when  it comes to snow days.  He does not like snow days.  He gets really mad if you don't make it in. 
[00:14:00]  Talk to Ron and Fez.  But I'll tell you this much, a little message for him, a little message for him, every other  radio station I worked for, when these crazy fucking over-the-top, unbelievable snows are  going to happen.  Everyone knows it.  The radio station has put a lot of people up in cheap hotels just to make sure they're  close to the radio station.  Yep.  So you can't not plan ahead as the boss and maybe get some hotel rooms together, and then 
[00:14:30]  the next day expect everybody to be here.  To be there, yeah.  Because it's a blizzard out there.  It's a snorricane.  It's worse than a blizzard.  It's a snorricane.  It's a snorricane.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  A snorricane we're going with?  Snorricane.  Snorricane.  Might be a snorricane.  Snorricane-o.  Too many N's.  I know.  That's what I say about this place.  Oh.  Oh, I thought you meant snorricane.  Oh, the word.  Snorricane.  I was just making a statement. 
[00:15:00]  Thanks for the softball.  What are they pitching a tent for on Channel 11?  It's Storm Team 11 in Newton, New Jersey.  Storm Team 11.  They pitched a tent.  It's just a little move out of here.  We'll see less snow as we go into Sunday and Monday, but still a little.  Less snow as we get into Sunday and Monday.  What day is it?  They're showing Monday with snow coming down.  Oh, no.  It's a continuous thing of snow.  Wow.  All right, Sam, you got a responsibility. 
[00:15:30]  This is our second official snow day on the Opie and Anthony show.  That means you have to come up with fun and hijinks.  I'll see.  Yeah, we'll have some hijinks for today.  Definitely make E-Rock do something completely ridiculous.  That was the first name that popped into my head.  Huh?  Yeah.  Well, yeah, but he does not eat.  That's crazy.  He's going on a hunger stretch.  E-Rock does very special things when it's a snow day.  Yeah.  All right, let's see what the listeners are up to, man.  Mark in Levittown.  Mark.  Hey, how you doing, boys?  Hey, man.  Hey, Anthony.  Smartest thing you ever did was saying in the city tonight. 
[00:16:00]  I don't know why the fuck National County can't figure out how to plow the road.  Yeah, the Expressway and Parkway is probably a wreck, right?  Dude, Wanto State Parkway has got about a foot and a half of snow on it.  I don't know where the hell it came from.  Really?  I'm not into it.  Yeah, they're taking the snow off of, like, people's lawns and putting them in the road.  Putting the snow on the road.  You know, with all the taxes we pay, let's go down this road for a minute or two.  You can't.  It's not plowed.  Ba-da-ba-ba-da-ba. 
[00:16:30]  Snow day.  With all the taxes we pay, the very least they could do is to make sure, you know,  the roads are properly maintained on days like this.  Yeah, plowed.  Salted.  You know what I mean?  Exactly.  You know what I mean?  You think Bobo will make it in?  Bobo already called out.  He had a doctor's appointment.  Oh, no.  He's sick?  Probably, I would assume.  He was supposed to come in yesterday, but he didn't because he was sick, I guess. 
[00:17:00]  And so Travis was on the phone with him after the show, and we were kind of letting him  know that he was, we felt like he was, him and Tracy Morgan were who we were talking  about yesterday.  Oh, no.  Maybe this is it for Bobo on the show.  Oh, no.  He was panicking, I bet.  He offered to bring in two pizzas and to eat out Butch's asshole.  Did he take the stuff?  They never take it.  They just, they just chat about it.  I like the two pizzas first, then eat out Butch's asshole.  That's, that's wonderful. 
[00:17:30]  Let's say hi to John in Jersey.  What's up, John?  What's up, boys?  Hey, John.  Fucking 36 hours of freaking plowing.  I've been waiting for you guys to come on the radio.  Ah, so you're one of the plow guys, eh?  Yeah, yeah.  You like, are you like private plow guy for parking lots?  Are you one of those big conga line highway guys?  Uh, China, I work for a town.  I work for a township, so, yeah, I'm kind of a Congolite.  Could you plow, uh, Steve out so he can make it in? 
[00:18:00]  Yeah, a hundred feet.  I will personally drive out there if I can get his fucking bare ass.  I think the thing that bothers me the most about the Steve email is, like, the blatant lie.  The it sucks.  The blatant lie that he writes, I went a hundred feet.  A hundred feet.  That is such a lie.  That's all I could go.  A hundred feet.  No one goes a hundred feet.  No, I used a tape measure.  I know it was one hundred feet.  Because if you commit to your car, and you're actually moving forward in your car, that's it. 
[00:18:30]  You've committed.  You're going.  Everyone knows that.  You're going.  What happened after a hundred feet that wasn't happening before a hundred feet?  He doesn't have a one hundred foot driveway, so it wasn't his driveway and then the road.  So he got on the road, he's driving, and then after a hundred feet, something happened.  That's where the Snurricane cuts off.  Yeah, yeah.  A hundred feet before Steve's house.  So did he drive the hundred feet back into his parking spot? 
[00:19:00]  Yeah.  Did he leave his car there and walk back trudging through the snow?  I don't know.  Boy, I mean, maybe he should call the show.  We need answers.  Maybe we do need some answers.  Let's go to Miles in Minnesota.  Miles.  Yeah.  I can see for miles.  What's up, Miles?  Anyway, I just, I don't understand, you know, Steve, everybody else made it except for Steve,  so instead of a snow day, wouldn't it just be your typical fucking Monday? 
[00:19:30]  It does.  Now it feels like, you know, it's Friday.  It feels like a Monday now.  Yeah, it does.  You know, it sucks.  I got to tell you, man, I need to figure out how to take days off.  It seems like the easiest thing to do if you work for the Opie and Anthony show.  Here's the problem.  You have a work ethic.  It's called just not showing up.  But people do it all the time.  I, like, I actually don't feel well at all.  I don't feel good.  Yeah.  I'm having my once a year winter sickness. 
[00:20:00]  I'm just hoping that by Monday I'll be fine.  You don't take enough days off.  No, I don't.  And I should have taken today.  Today would have been perfect.  But I didn't want to miss the snow.  Snow day.  I'll tell you the truth.  Snow days.  Snow day shows are my favorite shows.  You've got to love the snow day.  So, Sam, don't disappoint me.  You better come up with some good stuff.  I will.  Activities to keep the kids distracted.  And even if you need a little fucking, you know, pocket money to make it happen, let me know.  I want to be surprised with some fun snow day activities.  Normally I would just have Steve expensive, but, you know. 
[00:20:30]  I will give up money as long as you're getting some good activities together.  Steve Seed called back good.  Steve, what's up?  Hello, boy.  Two things.  First, I'll just let you know, I won't be here Monday.  I do.  I love cock.  All right.  So, we've learned he won't be here Monday either.  And he loves the cock.  This is starting to turn into Ian Halpern's Wikipedia.  Maybe that's what happened.  I went 100 feet and there was a nude man. 
[00:21:00]  So, I had to service.  I actually couldn't do it to myself.  On the replay yesterday, I was laughing so hard again when you were going through the Wikipedia page.  I actually had to turn off the radio.  I'm like, I can't do this to myself again.  One of the best laughs I've ever had in my life.  That was fucking funny.  That guy was just out of his mind.  Bravo to everyone with their fucking writing abilities on that Wikipedia page.  David, Kansas City.  Morning, boys.  Kansas City.  Happy snow day.  I figured out why your roads are not plowed because the governor can't fucking see anything. 
[00:21:30]  Yeah, it's fine for him.  He doesn't have a problem driving.  I bet he made it into work.  Well, I don't know.  I don't know, but we have a governor in New York that's basically going to be kicked out of office.  He's going to be the second one kicked out of office.  This Governor Patterson.  I don't know.  I don't know what they got on him, but the front page today is time to go, Dave.  And then this headline made me laugh all morning.  Pack your dirty tricks and get the hell out of here.  Now you get the hell out of here. 
[00:22:00]  That's an actual headline.  Pack your dirty tricks.  Say, get the hell out of here.  So I don't know.  What's he up to?  Shenanigans.  Lots of shenanigans, right?  There's all kinds of allegations just bubbling below the surface.  He's saying he's not going anywhere.  Go screw.  And everybody else is kind of going, look, there's shenanigans and they are coming out.  Do we know what the shenanigans are?  They're kind of like...  There's like... 
[00:22:30]  It could involve other women.  It could involve improprieties.  There's all kinds of shenanigans.  And his lieutenant governor is a bad boy?  Who is that now at this point?  It's Richard Ravitch.  It is clear that the governor tolerated domestic abuse accusations against his closest confidant.  And there is a suggestion that he joins state troopers in a campaign of witness tampering to shield the aid from prosecution. 
[00:23:00]  What's that about?  So he's got this close confidant who apparently was involved in some domestic abuse.  And he used state troopers and himself in witness tampering to shield that aid from being prosecuted from the domestic abuse allegations.  Uh-oh.  So witness tampering.  That isn't only get out of here.  You could very well go to jail. 
[00:23:30]  And that's just one of a few things going on with this guy?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So we don't need to bore the rest of the country with it.  But we've got a governor that looks like he's going to get...  Well, he's certainly not going to get elected.  We have a gubernatorial revolving door.  They just come flying in, flying out.  A new guy comes in.  He fucks up.  Flies out.  I don't even know who the lieutenant governor is now at this point that might have to take over.  Uh, but it's just been an embarrassment to New York State. 
[00:24:00]  And then this other Charlie Rangel.  Holy shit.  Charlie Rangel.  It's, it's, he's the, the Teflon...  Well, I won't say it.  Hold on.  He's the Teflon...  Oh, boy.  This guy has been in trouble for years.  There's been allegations of him just being a shyster.  And, um, no one's been able to touch him.  But this time, I mean, they have legitimate shit against him.  Just misappropriation of funds. 
[00:24:30]  Uh, money he was using that he was not supposed to use for what he was using it for.  Trips and things like that.  And he cannot, he can never take responsibility.  He's blaming his staffers.  He's throwing everyone under the bus except his lousy-ass self.  Who is constantly embroiled in, in, uh, these, again, shenanigans.  It's time for Charlie Rangel to get the fuck out of New York.  Leave. 
[00:25:00]  Leave.  Live.  Live.  Live.  Live.  Live.  Live.  Uh, Anthony, and more importantly, Steve C's finally calling back.  Oh, thank God.  Steve C.  Yes.  This is Steve Carleese.  Yes.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry I couldn't make it into work today.  I have a pair of big sweaty balls on my face and a big black cock in my ass.  Oh.  Oh, okay.  Oh.  Oh, wow. 
[00:25:30]  Let's say hi to Stryker.  Stryker.  Hey, Stryker.  Good morning, boys.  Hey, I have to defend Steve.  Now, you know, here in Colorado last night, where I live, we got a quarter of an inch  of snow, and, well, I had to call my boss and tell him I was going to be two hours late  this morning because my snow brush broke.  So I understand fully what Steve's going through.  Your snow brush broke.  Oh.  You know, Steve was looking good around 530 because no one was here.  Yeah.  All right, brother.  But by 610, it turned out he was the only one that made it. 
[00:26:00]  Yeah, the only one.  The only one.  You never want to be the only one.  But I made it 100 feet.  Let's say hi to Mikey in Babylon.  Mikey.  Mikey.  Guys, what's going on?  Hey, man.  I am so fucking pissed off right now.  They haven't even plowed the roads at all.  Guys are going around corners.  They look like Starsky and Hutch spinning around.  The back wheels are flying out. 
[00:26:30]  Nice.  I've got to drive from Babylon to Brooklyn to get to work.  And if I don't go, because I don't have sick days, I take a $200 hit.  This is fucking ridiculous.  How come they can't come out here and plow the roads one time?  Well, with all the taxes we pay, man, that's the least of the things they should be doing for us.  Long Island taxes are crazy.  I know it's a tough storm.  You know, let's put that on the table.  But still, we pay tough taxes.  So our tough taxes should go toward making sure the roads are taken care of from this tough storm. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah, you're talking about the taxes that Patterson's now saying he might not even be able to give us our refunds  because we don't have enough money in the fucking state?  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah, okay, that tax money.  That would explain why the roads look like this.  That's another one.  And then have you seen the commercials for this yet?  Because the misrepresentation of these commercials are astounding.  They want to tax beverages with soda, with sugar in them, sugary beverages. 
[00:27:30]  Right.  They want to throw another giant tax on top of that to raise a bunch of money for New York City or New York State because it's broke.  New York State's broke.  But they're not presenting it that way.  They're calling it a health, not even tax.  I don't know what they're calling it.  But they've figured out a way to word it where it sounds like you're paying for a healthy state.  Like, here, we don't want sugary drinks. 
[00:28:00]  This will prevent people.  They have nurses and doctors pitching this thing.  And then they say it's brought to you by, you know, New York State.  And then there are people against it are talking about how it's just a tax and this is crazy, shouldn't do this.  And it's brought to you by the sugary beverage companies.  Like, they all have their own interests, but they present it in a way that seems like, well, oh, it's a health thing.  They don't want to.  They're trying to help you. 
[00:28:30]  They don't want to help the individual.  They don't give a shit.  Our politicians suck.  They don't give a shit.  It's a tax.  Because you dug yourself into a fucking hole by spending the shit out of money you'd never had.  And now you're screwed.  And now you're going to take it out of our podcast.  And now everybody's getting hit.  Don't they have a poor tax on beer now, too?  Oh, yeah.  We haven't even talked about that yet.  Or they're going for that.  I'm about to get hit by an 18-wheeler.  I'm punching out.  All right, Mikey.  Hang in there, brother.  I'm going to have to feel now every time I pull that tap for Danny in the bar in my basement. 
[00:29:00]  That I am now going to have to collect tax from you?  Since when did you pull it from me?  Well, that's true.  Oh, shit.  Shit, I'm going to have to pay you?  Oh, shit.  You can't even pour him a beer.  He's always behind the bar.  He's very comfortable behind the bar.  I used to be a bartender.  In front of the bar, laying under the bar.  Whatever.  Comes naturally.  Very much so.  It really does.  Like, he takes over.  There was a party we had with Danny.  I missed being a bartender.  I was a bartender for a while.  Danny was in Texas.  Yeah.  And we had a party, and I had a bunch of people over my house, and we realized we couldn't 
[00:29:30]  figure out how to, like, really mix drinks.  Like, we could do it, but it was a hassle.  It was for the Super Bowl.  Yeah.  Super Bowl.  Danny's just back there behind the bar, so it's like, all right.  You know, you ask for a drink, you get one.  Now you've got to go and make your own.  And then the video game console, so, you know, somebody wants to play a game, and it wasn't  coming up.  It was like, who's the guy that usually does?  Oh, that's right.  Danny usually fixes this.  And then...  You've got to make yourself indispensable. 
[00:30:00]  Yeah, that's what it is.  And then it's like, all right, we're going to...  Sal wants to karaoke.  Let's turn on the karaoke machine, and with this, because this thing isn't...  Oh, boy.  You know, where's Danny?  He usually runs karaoke.  It just...  You can't go away anymore.  You ruined the party.  It's probably becoming my basement.  It's slowly.  Steve.  Steve C's on the line.  Steve.  Yay!  Hello, boys.  How are you?  Good, Steve.  Hi.  I may not give 100% to the radio station, but I will go 100 feet forward. 
[00:30:30]  Yes.  100 feet.  Let's say hi to John in Atlanta.  John.  Morning, boys.  I was wondering if they could hire the curling sweepers to sweep his Prius into work today.  You just push it, and as it's sliding, there's curling people sweeping in front of it.  You know why he could have made Steve drives one of those cars that you have to pull it back a whole lot first and then let it go? 
[00:31:00]  Yeah, let it go.  It's like a little spring toy car.  That's funny.  Yeah, I would put it back 100 feet.  It went 100 feet.  Joseph from New York.  I knew we were going to get one of the guys on the line.  I'm not blaming you, Joseph, personally.  I'm sorry for that.  It's a bigger issue with our stupid politicians.  Well, you know what it is?  A lot of guys retired from sanitation this year.  They don't want to hire anybody because of the money.  Now, we were out there like we are out there with every storm.  We're working. 
[00:31:30]  We're plowing.  But this shit just came down too fast today.  Too much.  We worked until 7 p.m. last night.  We're just going home now.  I'm getting stuck on my little fucking Civic right now on the way off.  It's all a Civic.  Yeah, see?  Unbelievable.  Pick it up and carry it.  What are you doing?  Jesus Christ.  It is true, though.  It's like any video game like The Sims or SimCity or any of those roller coaster games.  They cut the budget.  They pull some of these workers off.  And then next time it snows, the people are walking around. 
[00:32:00]  With a little red exclamation point over their head.  Absolutely.  What happens?  They're not letting anybody off.  They're just letting guys retire and not hiring anybody new.  Yeah.  And I want it to my house with my head down.  And I'm still in my uniform.  My neighbor's going to start fucking pelting me with soapbox now.  It's called trickle-down misery.  Yeah, absolutely.  All right, Joseph.  Have a good one, guys.  Thank you, brother.  See, he knows the deal.  John, Long Island.  What's up, guys?  Hey, man.  I'm having an Anthony moment right now.  I'm on the northern state.  I got a bunch of cunt mothers in four-wheel drives that don't know how to fucking drive. 
[00:32:30]  Yeah.  And all I want to do is go home.  I want to go home.  I want to go home.  And what's going on?  Are they driving?  Are they sliding?  Are they?  Oh, they're all in a line doing 20 miles an hour with their cautions on.  Oh, girls.  Get the fuck off the road.  I got to drive into snow.  Good thing I drive a four-wheel drive.  I got to drive in the unpaid lane so that I can get home because these motherfuckers don't want to get out of the way.  Yeah, you know, there's like one lane that's kind of got some blacktops showing, and everyone's in that one doing 10 miles an hour. 
[00:33:00]  Move a little faster.  You get into a slide, it's an adventure.  Absolutely.  When you get into a little skin, you recover, and you're like, fuck.  That was cool.  When I learned how to drive, my father took me out in a parking lot in the snow and said, here, spin this thing around to learn how to do it, because when it happens to real, you'll know.  Yeah.  All these people have no idea what they're doing out here.  Stay the fuck home.  So stop getting on the road with people who want to get home, who can drive in the snow.  I don't feel like getting hit from the side because some idiot has no idea what he's doing. 
[00:33:30]  Oh, I like the way this guy thinks.  There you go.  Exactly.  I'm having an Anthony moment.  I agree.  Oh, just wait until the drive.  I'm just going to record my entire drive home.  You really should.  Because it will be a catastrophe.  I got my flip.  I will record my drive home because I know I will be yelling the entire way home.  Oh, you definitely will, Anthony.  Because this ain't stopping.  This isn't going to be cleared up.  The roads aren't going to be clear.  This storm apparently has stalled.  Yeah, it's coming back at us now. 
[00:34:00]  And it just keeps whipping around in the same area.  We're going to...  They're saying it's supposed to snow until Monday or something.  They haven't plowed this road yet.  They're never going to get this shit done out here.  All right, man.  Hang in there.  Have a good one, guys.  Yeah, it's spinning right now.  It's going to spin in some dry air or whatever.  And then it comes back at us.  It's just spinning.  It's spinning.  It's taking the moisture off the ocean and pouring it onto our area.  Why don't we take our first break?  It's a snow day show.  Yes.  We called it.  This is our second snow day show of the year. 
[00:34:30]  Sam is responsible for making sure it's a fun snow day show.  I know at 7.30 we're premiering our version of the We Are the World show.  We Are the World.  Oh, we got a time we're premiering it?  7.30.  7.30.  Stay by your radios.  7.30.  And then we'll play it a couple more times today.  I want to see a satellite shot of Steve's house where a 100-foot radius perfectly around his house is clear.  Google Earth that shit.  Is clear.  And then at 100 feet, it's just a wall of snow that he ran into. 
[00:35:00]  And it stopped his car dead.  Oh, by the way, we really don't have time to talk about cop-out today because we're very, very busy.  Just want to say that today.  We're too busy to talk about cop-out today.  There's a lot going on.  Too much going on.  So if you want to talk about cop-out, I don't know what to tell you.  We just don't have time today.  Is he looking at us?  Oh, hi, Travis.  We're looking at Travis on cam and he can see us on cam.  Wait, I want to point to Travis at the break, see if this is going to work. 
[00:35:30]  See if it works.  Oh, look, he wrote a good segment.  Oh, thank you, Travis.  With that, we'll be back with our snow day show.  Stay there.  Opie and Anthony.  Yeah, that's a good point.  You were talking about during the break how it was snowing out the windows yesterday morning.  And then we got down to the street and it was raining.  Yeah, we're on the 36th floor.  So when we looked out the windows up here. 
[00:36:00]  You just gave away our location.  What's wrong with you?  Giant.  Oh, my God.  What's wrong with you?  Oh, my God.  With security downstairs.  I think we're safe.  Ah, see?  See?  Can I pass by?  See?  Stupid fake.  El go-o.  Stupid fake security.  Yeah, so the big, big giant snowflakes outside the window where it looked like a blizzard up here.  And then you take the elevator downstairs, walk out on the street, and it was raining.  So somewhere between 36th floor and ground level, the snow turned to rain. 
[00:36:30]  Really fucked up.  Yeah.  I don't think I've ever seen that before.  Nope.  Never noticed.  Fezzy pointed that out, though.  Yes!  Let's go to Greg in Maryland.  Greg?  Greg!  Good morning, boy.  Hi, Greg.  Hi.  I was calling to tell everybody in New York who's bitching about not having the plows out  and who's bitching about how it's hard for them to drive to work.  Yes!  Shut the fuck up!  Why?  I live in Maryland.  We got 36 inches of snow in one storm.  We got 18 inches three days later. 
[00:37:00]  Our governor's not blind.  He actually looked outside and said, don't go to fucking work.  Mm-hmm.  And people listen.  Well, this state is pretty desperate right now, so he needs everyone to go to work.  And as far as Maryland goes, if you're talking about Baltimore, did he tell the three people  that have jobs not to go to work?  No, I'm in between Baltimore and Washington.  Yes, yes.  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  The train goes through there.  We've seen what happens in that place. 
[00:37:30]  You don't want to get out of the train where the train stops.  No.  No.  That's where they've got the wire.  No.  Yeah, it's pretty scary.  It is frightening.  It's very interesting.  It really is.  To look out that train window and see the Baltimore project.  Beirut.  All right, sir.  Thank you.  Baltimore's the city that bleeds.  We love it.  Yep.  All right, man.  Let's go to Jeff in Cleveland.  Jeff.  God needed a boner.  Yeah, boner's dead.  So I guess God needed a boner. 
[00:38:00]  God.  Wait.  That doesn't sound as good as God needed a, you know.  It follows the formula, though.  Astronauter.  I guess God needed a boner.  A baseball player or something like that.  God needed a boner.  Well, we said this boner would be dead.  And what?  They found him in a park in Vancouver?  Yeah.  Strolling through the park one day.  Yeah.  It took his own life.  How did he take his life, Ant?  Do you know? 
[00:38:30]  You know something?  I was looking for info on that, and nothing.  They didn't say.  But they said, because of how he was found, there is no indication of any foul play.  So it's blatantly obvious that he killed himself.  So I'm going to go with, I want to say gunshot to the head.  But even that, they wouldn't immediately dismiss.  Maybe pills.  Maybe pills.  Go to the woods. 
[00:39:00]  You fucking down some pills and booze and just kind of.  I'm going to go with an old-fashioned hanging.  Hanging?  A lot of trees in the woods.  That's macabre.  That's macabre when you hang yourself.  The spokesperson said they are not releasing Andrew's cause of death yet due to the sensitivity of the situation.  He's dead, Chekhov.  But what's the sensitivity of situation?  Because his parents already know he's dead.  Yeah.  Well, I guess they don't want, you know, all the details out. 
[00:39:30]  But Boner's...  No longer with us.  Boner's dead.  Holy shit, Ahmad Ali's got info on Boner's death.  Ahmad Ali.  Our Olympic correspondent.  Ahmad.  How's it going, guys?  What's up, Ahmad?  Hello.  He died in Stanley Park, which is a downtown park.  It's the equivalent of, like, Central Park, right downtown.  And oddly enough, he was last seen at a bakery shop right in front of the park.  And that's how he had been right before, I guess, minutes before he took his last role and killed himself.  But the thing was...  Hold on. 
[00:40:00]  Slow down.  I want to go with that for a second.  If you're going to kill yourself, you don't have to worry about fucking fat content and calories.  So you go and get yourself a nice muffin.  Oh, load up.  You load up on a fine muffin or something.  Yes.  I think it was a cupcake shop that he went in.  Well, you could have as many cupcakes as you want without the guilt if you're going to kill yourself in an hour.  No, you can't blame him.  Yeah.  But did you see Larry King last night?  His parents actually walked off the show.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, really?  Do we have that audio?  What happened was Larry entirely forgot about them. 
[00:40:30]  Why would we?  He told them that you guys are going to be up.  And, you know, he was tweeting it on Larry King's Twitter.  Hold on.  How important is the boner?  All right.  Listen.  Listen.  Why don't you slow down again, Ahmad?  Don't fool yourself.  I do follow Larry King on Twitter.  He ain't writing that shit.  No.  He doesn't even know he has a Twitter.  What's a Twitter?  A lot of these people have, like, an assistant or something that's writing their tweets. 
[00:41:00]  Larry King is not writing his own tweets.  You can tell by when you read them.  Took a nice shit today.  Rarely happens in the morning.  But they were promoting it as if, you know.  Thought I got an erection, but it was just a sneeze.  Poor Larry.  He doesn't write his own tweets.  No.  Go ahead, Ahmad.  I'm sorry.  So the parents.  But they were promoting it as if this is the key story on the show. 
[00:41:30]  And because they were going to have an exclusive interview with the guy's parents.  And so they had his parents in there.  And they're waiting and waiting.  And Larry keeps delaying it and telling them, okay, next segment.  And this is what Andrew Koenig's sister actually came out and said.  And the parents eventually realized there's only four minutes left in the show.  And they basically just said, okay, screw this, and got up and left.  And then Larry, with four minutes in the show, goes, where did they go?  I was just about to have them on.  They just got up and left.  And that was the end of the show. 
[00:42:00]  Yeah, they didn't have enough time for the parents.  You can't squeeze in.  How do they bounce?  Yeah, you can't squeeze in the parents of a kid that is probably dead.  Because I don't know if they knew it at that time.  No, they knew he had killed himself.  And they discovered his body.  And that was what they were going to go talk about.  And Larry thought, okay, we'll throw that in there for the last one.  What the fuck is wrong with these people?  You just find out your son is dead in a park in Vancouver.  And you need to go on Larry King and talk about it?  What's that about?  The first thing he did, he had a press conference downtown at the police station. 
[00:42:30]  Wouldn't it be great if Larry King got them on and just asked his father,  So did you know that you were on SETI Alpha 6 and that Khan was going to put a creature in your body?  Comment, question, comment.  Did you know that you were on the Botany Bay and that Khan was coming back?  Even though you weren't in the original episode of Space Seed back in the 60s series. 
[00:43:00]  How did you know, Khan, if you weren't even on the ship yet?  Just ask all Star Trek questions.  Just start asking Star Trek questions.  That would be amazing.  That would be great.  That would be amazing.  So what else you got on that, Ahmad?  Yeah, that's about it on Andrew Koenig.  But next time you have Ian Alperin on, make sure you ask him about his time as a homeless man.  A homeless man? 
[00:43:30]  He was homeless.  He used to be a busker in Canada.  That's where his music talent came from.  He was a famous busker at the Montreal subway station.  I don't know what a busker is.  A guy who plays music at a subway.  No, I guess I figured that much out, but I never heard the word before.  I never either, yeah.  What's the word?  Busker.  Buster?  Busker with a K.  Busker.  Busker.  I've never heard of that before.  That's a Canadian term, I guess.  Sounds like a curling term.  You've got to make sure the stone gets into the busker. 
[00:44:00]  Because for the people out there that thought yesterday's show was the end of Ian Alperin,  oh man, were you mistaken.  Oh, no, no, no.  Now I'm more in than ever before.  There will be more fucking battles with that cunt.  I've got a couple pages of research on the guy I can send you.  Oh, really?  Or were you calling yourself?  Because you were great when you took him on yesterday.  Yeah, yeah, definitely.  Hey, Ma, what's going on in the Olympics?  I mean, you know, the Americans lost to the Canadians in women's hockey.  I mean, it was a great game, but we just couldn't fucking score last night. 
[00:44:30]  Who cares?  Who cares?  There was women's figure skating.  Well, we're going to get into women's figure skating in a second, Anthony.  But let's start with the hockey here.  Oh.  Oh, I guess this, do you know anything about, what?  The Canadian broads are in trouble.  I was going to ask you that.  Okay, yeah.  About a half an hour after the game, they went on the ice and they started drinking.  They brought out the beer and the champagne and they started drinking cigars.  And now the Olympic committee is all pissed off because they're like, well, we don't allow alcohol in our celebrations. 
[00:45:00]  And apparently, the drinking age here in BC is 19.  And some of the girls were 18.  Hot.  And they were drinking and that caused a little bit of problems.  Yeah, but you just won a gold medal.  What, they're going to take your gold medal away after the event because you were drinking?  I would say don't fork yourself.  The Olympic committee is completely European about stuff.  So, do you hear about this American snowboarder, Scotty Lego, what they're doing to him?  What are they doing to him?  Well, he was on TMZ.  I'm not sure if you guys saw the picture, but he basically went out to a club after he won the bronze here. 
[00:45:30]  Sean White won the gold.  And he's basically partying with some girls.  And these girls are coming by and biting his medal, you know, to see if it's real bronze.  And this Asian chick comes by and he lifts up his T-shirt and he puts the medal down where his cock is and she bites it.  And somebody snaps a photo.  Oh, yeah.  Well.  And so, the American Olympic committee now, the Snowboard Association of the U.S. and stuff, they all came out with a statement to the press saying, his involvement is unacceptable. 
[00:46:00]  And, you know, and basically he left Vancouver and had to go home to his hometown because they were like, we don't want this guy around the U.S. team.  He's brought us down.  Oh, please.  Stop taking yourself so seriously.  Especially with a bronze.  And the bronze medal, by the way, if I was lucky enough to be in the Olympics and I won bronze, I wouldn't wear that shit.  I'd wing it across a lake and skip it.  They put that around my neck and give me the flowers.  I would throw the flowers and the medal right back at them. 
[00:46:30]  Take it.  And then march off the ice.  You know what this means?  I lost.  That's right.  Silver.  Gold is what you want.  There was a whole thing.  Gold is what you want at this point.  Last night, we talked about that on Red Eye.  There's a whole thing where some shrink got into it saying that people would rather get the bronze than the silver.  Because the silver means you were so close to getting the gold.  And the bronze, you're like, well, I almost didn't medal at all.  So, you're almost happier to get that. 
[00:47:00]  But, you know, it's funny you should say that because I watched the medal ceremony after the women's hockey last night.  And who was it?  It was Finland, I guess, won the bronze.  Finland.  Yep.  And they were extremely happy, Anthony.  Yeah.  This proves your point.  Extremely happy.  Kissing each other.  Biting the medals.  They couldn't be happier that they won the bronze.  Then the Americans won the silver.  They're all just crying their eyes out.  I mean, they're just not happy that they did not win the gold, which the Canadians won.  Because you feel like you missed out.  You just missed getting the top honor. 
[00:47:30]  But then bronze, you're like, hey, I could have gotten nothing.  So, yeah.  And do you know anything on good old Mike Milbury?  I love this fucking guy.  Mike?  And now I guess he's in trouble.  Yeah.  I don't know.  He's always been in trouble.  But they have him and Roenick on there.  I mean, they're just asking for trouble.  But he was the guy who screwed up the Islanders, by the way.  I know.  I'm not stupid.  I'm an Islanders fan.  But I still like this.  I love any athlete with an attitude.  I don't care who they play for.  I don't care if they screwed up my team. 
[00:48:00]  I mean, Mike Milbury climbed into the stands and beat a fan with a shoe.  I mean, how could he not love this guy?  And he is on with Roenick.  And they hate each other, Anthony.  And it's getting to a point where you're convinced they're going to fucking, like, not just yell at each other.  They're going to fight.  Kill each other.  Yes.  Yes.  Which makes for great TV.  That is fantastic.  But I guess he called the Russians Eurotrash?  Yeah.  He called their hockey Eurotrash.  Yeah.  He called the Russian hockey team Eurotrash.  So now he's in a bit of a bind over that.  Are they Eurotrash?  Yes. 
[00:48:30]  Eurotrash is a very accepted word at this point.  Yeah, it is.  When you see the fucking Eurotrash waiting to get into clubs, you go, oh, wow, look.  Eurotrash.  Look at all the Eurotrash.  You can pick them out a mile away.  I understand.  So.  Mm.  And what else?  There was, uh, da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  Well, we got...  Closing ceremonies this Sunday?  Fuck the closing ceremonies.  We still got a couple hockey games to deal with.  Oh, yeah.  We do have some big hockey games.  We got the semifinals coming up.  We got U.S.-Finland today at three.  Yep.  And then Canada versus Slovakia at nine. 
[00:49:00]  I don't know if Finland's going to beat the United States.  They're just going to beat them.  Finland's tough.  Finland's tough.  You know what?  It's going to be a good game today.  Bring it factor.  The bring it factor.  That's what I am calling it.  USA knows how to bring it.  Well, we better hope Ryan Miller stands on his head.  He's got to stand on his head.  I can't tell you how many times I've read stand on his head on my Twitter last week.  Of course.  What's her name from the Canadian team was standing on her head yesterday?  Standing on her head.  She certainly was. 
[00:49:30]  She shut out the Americans.  Ryan Miller's just been lights out.  The thing is, all the goalies left in this tournament, they all either play in Canada or in Buffalo.  So they're not really big stars, but they're all great goalies.  Yeah, we'll see.  If they need to play in New York, they'd be huge.  And then I am rooting for Canada over Slovakia because I want to see U.S.-Canada again.  Because I think that'll be more exciting.  I'm going to say it.  This is going to be crazy.  I'm going to say it.  More exciting than the Super Bowl.  There you go.  U.S.-Canada for the gold is more exciting than the Super Bowl. 
[00:50:00]  I think I've got to agree with you on that one.  And you're not going to get the broads watching, unfortunately.  So you're not going to get Super Bowl numbers as far as ratings go.  But they're going to be ridiculous things.  And you won't get the bullshit of having to explain stuff to broads.  To broads.  And having broads ruin your time that you're spending with your men friends.  Would you watch U.S.-Canada?  Absolutely.  And I haven't watched one Olympic hockey game.  But U.S. versus Canada, I'm all in.  I'm fucking all in on that one. 
[00:50:30]  Let's set up a little party at your house.  Oh, nice.  A little view.  When's the game?  Sunday or Saturday?  It's on Sunday at about 12 o'clock Pacific.  So about 3.15 Eastern.  Dude, I'm coming out to the fucking compound.  We're putting it on the big screen if it's U.S.-Canada.  Big screen.  If it's U.S.-Slovakia or Canada-Finland or Finland-Slovakia, then fuck that.  Then I'm watching Forensic Files.  All the scalpers here are scared shitless that it's going to be Finland-Slovakia.  Really?  Oh, my God. 
[00:51:00]  Right?  Imagine that.  The scalpers are just waiting for their investment to come in.  Oh, yeah.  No, nobody's going to go to that game.  I mean, you know.  No one would care.  Small figures like that in Europe.  This one could actually start a Canadian-United States war.  I would like to see that.  Like, the hockey game gets so intense that we actually invade Canada with military might  and crush them in 10 minutes.  Oh, we would hold you guys off, man.  Oh, are you kidding? 
[00:51:30]  Look, now you're being stupid.  Come on, let's relax.  Have you seen the FAA teens that we have and the Abrams tanks?  What do you got?  We're in the Commonwealth.  What do you got?  What do you have?  What do you have?  What do you have?  We're in the Commonwealth of Nations.  We got Britain.  We got Northern Ireland.  You think they're going to fucking come to your aid?  We fucking help them out a lot more than you guys do.  We'd kick the shit out of you guys.  The one thing they got is those Mountie uniforms, though, man.  Yeah, pretty fucking impressive.  Well, that's true.  I don't know if they could do anything, but them, those uniforms are impressive. 
[00:52:00]  Yeah, but we've got Canadian wilderness that we know.  We've got insurgents up here.  You don't have a wilderness that anyone knows.  Everybody lives 10 miles from the American border.  We don't even have to leave.  We'll press a few buttons, send a few rockets over there.  You're all dead.  The end.  Dead!  The Canadian states of America.  Stop.  Ahmaud, we could use the room.  That wouldn't be that bad.  Most of us wouldn't resist.  We'd be like, all right, bring it on.  I hear you.  All right, hold on, Ahmaud.  We're keeping you on the line.  Eric in Jersey. 
[00:52:30]  He's a wrestler.  Let me tell you something.  Were you an Olympic wrestler, Eric?  No, no, no.  I never made it that far.  Okay.  But the idea of the bronze medal being a little bit more important is with any bracket system  and all of the games are our bracket systems.  If you win the silver, you've actually lost your last match.  And if you win the bronze, you've actually won your last match in a consolation round. 
[00:53:00]  So if you're going out on a high note and a silver medalist, you know, he's sitting behind the guy that just beat him.  You lost.  The bronze, you won.  Psychologically, that makes a lot of sense.  But if you're skiing or something and you're just going against the clock, you could accept the silver a little better than if you lost an actual game, I guess, right?  Yeah.  Oh, absolutely.  Now, Opie, on a different note, are you going to the UFC fight at the Prudential Center?  Hell fucking yeah.  We're going to have all those guys in, too.  I think we're all going.  We're going to have Frank Mirren. 
[00:53:30]  Who else did we say yes to?  Dick.  I know he is.  That's why we're going to get into it with him.  I hope Lesnar kills that top something.  I think he will.  Yeah, you heard what he said, right?  He wants Lesnar to be the first death in the ring or in the cage.  Jesus.  And that's the last thing you want to say to that shaved fucking gorilla.  He's going to kill somebody.  Yeah, no kidding.  He didn't learn his lesson the last time.  I mean, fucking Lesnar made sure it hurt the last time they fought.  I met you at the show in Philly. 
[00:54:00]  Stunker.  I'm the dude with the wow leg tattoo.  Oh, fuck yeah.  This guy's got a great wow tattoo on his shin.  Yeah, absolutely.  Yeah, we'll all be there.  All right, I'm bringing up some of the guys from Philly, and Jimmy's going.  I think Ann might even make it over there.  All right.  See you.  I hope I see you there, man.  All right, brother.  Thank you.  All right, there goes Eric.  Ahmad, hold on.  We've got a broad that watches hockey that's a little insulted by what Anthony said.  Michelle.  A broad?  Are you a broad?  Yes.  I am a broad.  A broad.  I grew up on hockey. 
[00:54:30]  I've been pissed that they've been showing the games at 3 o'clock in the afternoon.  I have to work.  Yeah?  So, yeah, some of us broads know hockey better than the Mets.  Big B's fan, are you?  As a matter of fact, at the moment, no.  Oh, wow.  Typically, yes.  The way they've been playing.  Oh, I understand that.  I haven't kept track of the B's.  Not doing that good this season.  Look, man, I'm an Islanders fan, and, you know, another rough year for us.  We were in a playoff spot.  Now we're, I think, six to eight points out of the last playoff. 
[00:55:00]  Oh, really?  Right now.  Kind of bad.  But we do have our goalie as a backup goalie for the U.S., so he's not.  Oh, backup goalie.  Oh, that's pretty impressive.  Buffalo.  How many minutes has he played so far?  He's doing one of those headstands where he's got to use his hands, and he puts his knees  on his elbows, and he goes upside down.  He's not quite standing on his head.  He's doing cartwheels on the bench.  He's standing on his head.  All right, Michelle.  You want U.S. Canada, right?  Yeah.  Oh, yes. 
[00:55:30]  And it'll be on Sundays, so I won't have to argue.  Dude, how good.  All right, Michelle.  Go to the lemon tree.  Get that mullet clipped.  Hey, leave Michelle alone.  It sounds like she has a mullet.  I bet you she's hot.  It sounds like a mullet.  Are you hot?  No mullet.  No?  Hot?  These, but no mullet.  Yeah?  Yeah.  She didn't answer hot.  Punch it out.  Ha ha.  Punch it out.  Oh, boy.  That's a hockey broad.  Oh, boy.  She didn't even acknowledge I said hot.  That's a hockey broad.  Well, now everyone's pissed at you, Ahmad, because everyone knows U.S. would kick Canada's 
[00:56:00]  ass in a war.  Of course.  Just stop already.  I don't know.  I don't even know what you guys have.  Well, they have hockey, but if they have hockey, and if the U.S. beats Canada in the  gold medal match, if we could get there, then you have nothing.  Imagine all they have, they're on the ice, one guy drops a grenade, and then a hockey  player slap shots it at our soldiers.  That they'd probably be really good at.  Mm-hmm.  Slap shoot grenades at our guys. 
[00:56:30]  But we'd fuck you up something terrible.  I don't know, man.  I mean...  Oh, stop.  You know, hockey, hockey, you have a chance there, my friend.  I'll admit that.  But, uh...  Wait.  Uh, killing, destruction, ruined, or cities in ruin, um, I think you'd have a problem  there, my friend.  And we'd just nuke you.  Even with your current commander-in-chief?  I don't think so, man.  Uh, yeah, I don't care.  I don't care.  Even he could beat you.  Wow.  We're talking...  Are you actually supporting Obama on something for once? 
[00:57:00]  No, I'm just saying, uh, you know, the military gets in there, it's all over,  Johnny.  We would send him help and undercover, and he would...  Uh, I'm undercover, uh, I've infiltrated, uh, all of the military headquarters.  Shut up.  All right, hold on a minute.  Yes.  Uh, Mark in New Orleans.  Yes, Mark.  All I got to say, come on, man.  Hockey over the Super Bowl?  Come on!  Great.  Come on, man!  All right, now I'm laughing at you. 
[00:57:30]  Yeah?  See, you're from New Orleans, so you're too close to the situation.  I'm just saying, a whole country is going to be rooting for the U.S. of America.  Right.  No, I don't know what you're saying.  Versus this dirty fucking, uh, Canada.  Uh, but look, I'm all for that, but still.  I'm not saying that...  Come on, man!  All right, but I'm not going to say they're going to beat the Super Bowl ratings.  Of course not.  But it's going to be a much better game to watch than the Super Bowl.  All right, I'm going to watch...  Well, I don't know about all that, but I'm going to be just as interested. 
[00:58:00]  I'm going to be watching Clones from the U.S.  And I'm all for blowing up Canada, but...  I'm all for blowing up Canada, right?  That's the point we've reached.  Fucking Mark.  Thanks, Mark.  I'm all for blowing up Canada.  Hey, and Anthony watched figure skating last night, didn't you?  Well, you know something?  And then, uh, I came back to the hotel room.  I had left, uh, channel, uh, you know, NBC on.  And I get in, and figure skating's on.  And I'm like, I'm grabbing the remote, and then I just start watching, because, uh, you 
[00:58:30]  know, the announcers, they're really into this shit.  Mm-hmm.  And they kind of make it sound, you know, exciting.  Mm-hmm.  And, and, and the girls, they're kind of cute.  You know?  And they do good whoosh-whooshing around.  They have no boobs.  Doing their thing.  No, but that's okay.  They're, like, real flat, though.  But I think they wrap them up pretty tight.  You think they're all wrapped up?  They look like that.  And the Canadian girl, the Canadian girl had, like, a woman's body more than, like, a little  skater's body.  Does that make you go, ew? 
[00:59:00]  Uh, yeah.  Yeah.  No, it was, wow, wow.  That's a hell of a shot.  Is that from this year's Olympics?  No.  That's the, the guy, girl.  Danny's showing us some fucking, too bad that guy doesn't even notice that pussy's three  inches from his nose.  He's holding her by the vagina.  He has no idea how hot that is.  He does.  Look at the face that he's making.  Yeah, he's like, ew.  Oh, yeah, his face is like, ew.  Now, this is just, now, no, no men involved in this one.  This is just the ladies' final figure skating.  And, uh, uh, apparently the Korean girl won the first, uh, gold medal that Korea ever won 
[00:59:30]  in that.  Yeah.  And, and she was, uh, you know, for a Korean chick, uh, cute.  Especially, they're so sassy.  They're so sassy.  Did you guys get the tweet picture that I sent you guys this morning?  Why would we?  I sent you guys a picture of a Japanese female figure skater, and she's in shorts, or, uh,  sorry, uh, uh, speed skater, and she's in shorts. 
[01:00:00]  Yeah.  And she's got a normal body everywhere, except her thigh is like, it's like shorts niggers  died in the 70s.  Like a bodybuilder.  Like a giant muscular thigh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, wow.  There's a nipple that's out.  Oops.  Danny's finding some nip slips out on the eyes.  And another guy that doesn't know how hot that is.  That doesn't even care.  Doesn't even care.  Jesus.  Just skate with a guy.  Get it over with.  No hair around that nipple.  He doesn't want to see it.  Jeez Louise.  So, uh, so the figure skater.  And then, yeah. 
[01:00:30]  So, so they had the Korean girl who went out there, and, uh, just a perfect, uh, long routine.  Yeah.  Uh, amazing.  Um, she was doing those triple fucking spinny things.  I don't know what they're called.  But every time she'd land one, the announcer's like, oh my goodness, it's the first time in  history that's been done.  Oh.  Oh, they get the, I, you know, and I guess it's just because it, it is very feminine.  It's something to watch. 
[01:01:00]  Like, if a man is, is, um, uh, gay, I would gather he's watching it for the beauty and majesty  and grace of the whole thing.  I'm just looking because it's like, wow, that's really like hot or cute or looks good or whatever.  Um, and you can definitely, you know, I'll throw it out there.  You can appreciate what some of these fucking, uh, skaters are doing.  I was, it, it's unbelievably amazing.  I was going to say I can appreciate it because it all, it, their routines look exactly the 
[01:01:30]  same.  I don't know what, what makes one skater better than the other.  I was noticing there is a difference between the music.  They play different type of music and they do like a, like the Russians will come out  and do that run, like Marchy kind of music and stuff.  And then the Japanese will do some graceful kind of fucking, you know, twang, twang.  Twang, twang, twang, twang, twang, twang, twang, twang, twang.  With a beat.  And the Americans come out to some kind of, you know, Americana kind of music and shit  like that. 
[01:02:00]  But, uh, so there was the Korean girl, right?  And then there's, uh, some, a little, little, uh, Japanese girl and she won the silver.  The Korean won the gold.  A little Japanese girl won the silver.  And the girl from Canada whose mother died like a couple of days ago.  What happened?  Her mother died.  What happened? 
[01:02:30]  Uh, I don't know.  What happened?  But she died a couple of days ago.  What happened?  Uh, I don't know, but the father was there.  What happened?  The mother died.  What happened?  Yeah, the mother, the mother died.  What do you do for a living, character?  She skates.  What happened?  I don't know.  It was, um, I'm going to make you stuck in a loop today.  But she, uh, she won the bronze.  She had a couple little mistakes, um, but very small. 
[01:03:00]  So she won the bronze and she looked up, uh, and like kind of was looking up at her, her  dead mom in heaven, uh, uh, up there.  And, um, and the announcer was just like, why do we always look up?  Because you assume they're in heaven.  Yeah, but wouldn't it be funny to look down and blow a kiss to the ground?  Like I know you were just a fucking cunt on wheels and, or a bastard or something.  And I know you're in hell.  But what if heaven is south of earth? 
[01:03:30]  It's up if you're in Japan or China.  Like that's, that's the direction.  But what?  You could still look down and technically you would be looking toward the heavens.  Yeah, because you know, it's all relative.  I guess.  Oh my God.  We are the world has entered the studio.  Oh my God.  It's dropped.  But Sam, at this point, I know we told everyone 730, but we're in the middle of our Olympic  break and we have to take a break.  So I think we're going to have to play the premiere of the O&A We Are The World song right  after the break today.  Got to tease it. 
[01:04:00]  Huh?  Yeah, stay tuned through the Olympic talk and then through the break for We Are The World.  Yeah, We Are The World right after the break.  Fantastic.  But we've got to continue with the Olympics for a little bit.  I agree.  Well, the announcer was broken up.  That's what I was, all I was really getting at.  Can we get that audio?  Is it worth playing?  I don't know.  Yeah, you could hear him because he, she's skating around to just massive applause because she's Canadian  and, and the crowd loves her and she's skating around after her routine and you could tell  she was getting choked up.  Her chin was doing that thing and her eyes are a little watery and she's looking up at 
[01:04:30]  her mom and they're showing the father in the stands crying and clapping and the announcer  who is, um, I guess his name was Gay Gayington says, says like, um, this is one of the most  courageous moments of the courage, the courage, the courage is huge.  Like he couldn't talk.  Scott Hamilton.  I was roaring.  Was it Scott?  Homilton?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow. 
[01:05:00]  Yeah, that was, uh, yeah, he was getting a little, he was getting a little, he was getting  a little choked up at, uh, at that.  Yeah, well, what are you going to do?  When I first came to Vancouver with one broken testicle, is that him?  I don't know.  I think he might've, I think he might've had a problem with a testicle.  I think there was something, I think it was twisted or something.  I don't know what the fuck.  I just wanted to be an ice skater.  And my dream came true. 
[01:05:30]  Ahmad, I think we got to let you go.  All right, man.  Okay.  Enjoy the closing ceremony on Sunday.  Why?  Good.  What?  The last we'll see of Vancouver.  Apparently Michael J. Foss is going to be part of it, so.  Oh, boy.  Batten down the hatches, people.  Oh, my God.  Might have another Haiti situation.  Don't give him a torch.  That place will go up in fire.  Don't put him, don't put him on the ice.  Yeah.  Let's fall right through.  If you go to YouTube, you type in Michael J. Foss Olympic commercial, it's very heroic. 
[01:06:00]  They have him skating and shooting a puck into the net and then being very stable.  It's amazing.  Really?  Yeah.  And, you know, it's funny because that's supposed to show, like, a Canadian backyard hockey rink.  I mean, it turns out they shot it in Long Island.  See?  They shot it in Pat LaFontaine's backyard.  Oh, that's great.  Yeah, Pat has a fucking ice rink in his backyard.  You got a Long Island for the ice day.  You got a Pat LaFontaine.  Your head muckety-muck premier, prime minister, president, whatever he is, goes to Miami to 
[01:06:30]  get his heart fucking fixed.  He's the premier of Newfoundland.  Oh, whatever it is.  A head muckety-muck up there, decided that social medicine sucked the fucking ass and came  down here to get his heart fixed because they were going to crack him open like a lobster  tail.  Stop it.  Well, NBC News, they did a feature at St. Paul's Hospital in Vancouver about an American  guy who came up here for treatment.  Oh, what did he have?  He had something.  Yeah, something.  Well, they figured this guy didn't want his chest cracked open, so they went in with, 
[01:07:00]  you know, microscopic little tubes and fixed his ass down in Florida.  Well, rich people go down there.  That's what we do.  Ahmaud, more importantly, everyone is very mad at your Canada could beat the U.S. in  a war.  In a war.  Kevin Atlanta really puts it, I don't know what I'm trying to say.  He just, he writes, who in the hell has Canada ever beat in a war?  That's true.  Ahmaud, comment?  The U.S.  War of 1812. 
[01:07:30]  War of 1812.  Stop it.  World War II, we were key players.  Oh, key players.  Get the fuck out of here.  You had sword.  That was nothing compared to Omaha.  Get out of here, you fucking revisionist history canuck.  We had the toughest beach.  You did not have the toughest beach.  Omaha was the toughest beach on D-Day.  You had sword and maybe gold.  There were pussy beaches.  There were people laying on blankets. 
[01:08:00]  We had a tougher time in Buffalo with the TNA for ONA.  The hitting those beaches were tough.  Oh, man, were they?  There were fucking vegetables being fired into vaginas.  All right, let's, let's, let's.  You didn't read it.  I hit those beaches.  It was a horror scene.  Shut up.  My God, like I've never seen before.  Shut up.  I think we could still get arrested.  It was like saving Private Ryan.  Shut up.  I got out of the vehicle, hit those beaches, and was horrified by what I saw.  I was still shell-shocked.  That girl took a zucchini and a fucking kumquat. 
[01:08:30]  I think, I think they could still arrest us.  It was amazing.  Yes, Ahmad?  Yeah, no, we liberated Holland as well.  Oh, good for you.  Oh, Holland, good, good.  Thank God.  If it wasn't for you, we wouldn't have wooden shoes.  Good for you.  Good for you.  All right, Ahmad, we'll, we'll talk to you Monday and maybe a little Olympic, uh, wrap-up  from you.  All right?  Ahmad Ali, he's been helping us out in Vancouver.  It's a love-hate relationship with Canada, by the way.  It's like a little brother.  You smack them around in the head, but if anyone fucks with them, you, you know, we'd 
[01:09:00]  come running.  Oh, we'll help Canada.  We'd come around.  But if no one's coming for you, you're just getting smacked in the head and called names.  There.  I worked in, uh, the U.S. Coalition in Tampa, and the Canadians are faggots.  That's Gennaro from Forum.  Faggots.  Dave from Canada.  U.S. got the military, but Canada can still kick your ass.  Oh, yeah?  Andy in Pittsburgh.  The longest sniper kill in Afghanistan was set by a Canadian.  Oh, okay, so line up a sniper shot to the fucking missile base that is fucking, to the 
[01:09:30]  fucking fire base that's targeting your major cities, and see what the bullet does.  Yeah.  Uh, Mac in Atlanta, I think Ant's gonna need some male hormone replacement if he's watching  Olympic skating.  Hey, I don't mind the chick skating thing.  It's not bad.  They, they look kind of, they're all cute and stuff.  What are you gonna do?  Our girl got robbed last night.  She was better than the Canadian girl.  I wouldn't know that.  What, the American little, uh, Jappy girl?  Yeah.  She's, she's an Asian girl.  She wasn't.  She was kind of stiff. 
[01:10:00]  Um, she's only 16, so she's kind of new at it.  She came in fourth.  Do you have a tough time like me, uh, rooting for, like, an American that looks like they  should be, um, on...  On the Japanese team?  Like, on an Asian team?  Or the other...  It's very confusing.  I thought she was the Japanese team.  It's the Olympics, and there's a, there's a Chinese team and a Japanese team, a Korean team,  but it says American.  Yeah.  That's, that's strange to me.  Yeah, like, the Korean team didn't have some girl that looked like she's from, you know,  Wisconsin. 
[01:10:30]  Yeah, they don't have a blonde hair, blue eye...  No.  Beauty?  No.  So all of a sudden they say, well, skating for America, Ching Chang Che.  Yeah.  And you're like, but there's a Chinese team.  Why isn't she skating for them?  She was very good, uh, and, and coming in fourth in her first Olympics at 16 years old.  Uh, this girl's got quite a future ahead of her, Opie.  Quite a, uh, quite a future ahead of her. 
[01:11:00]  What?  What?  Yeah, she did really well in her...  First Olympic appearance at 16.  Jimmy James writes, uh, well, these are all phone calls we just can't get to right now.  Canada sent a pilot to the first Gulf War, not a plane, just a pilot.  Is that true, Ann?  You know a little bit about that stuff.  I never heard that one, but that's hysterical.  I'm here.  You got something for me?  Uh, Kyle from Toronto wants to explain how horrible their army is.  Uh, Kyle, we'll take you. 
[01:11:30]  What's up?  Not much, everybody.  What's happening?  Uh, as far as our army, have you ever heard of pitchforks and hockey sticks?  Ah, is that it?  Like an angry mob chasing Frankenstein.  That's what the, uh, Canadian army looks like.  That's your army?  Basically, and that's about it.  And other than that, all I called to say was fucking help him because that guy makes me embarrassed to be fucking Canadian.  Yeah.  You're not done with that guy.  You think yesterday was his last appearance.  That's not true.  Yeah.  He'll be back next week, I do believe. 
[01:12:00]  Uh, let's take a, uh, let's do a twofer.  Another call from Toronto.  Jack?  Hey, how's it going, fellas?  What up, Jack?  Not much.  Hey, I used to be in the Marine Corps and, uh, went to Parris Island, served down in Beaufort.  But the only difference is that Americans, they're trained better.  Of course they're going to kick Canada's butt.  You know what it is?  Canada doesn't have to worry about, um, anything.  Because we're here. 
[01:12:30]  We're here.  Yeah, we are.  Don't worry about it.  Well, exactly.  And that, I think that's the way it's been forever.  But, you know what?  We have F-18s, we've got M-16s, we've got all that stuff.  But, you know what?  The reality is they're not trained as good.  All right.  You can send a whole, like, three companies from Parris Island over the border and we all,  you know, crap our pants.  Nah, nah, nah.  All right.  Very good.  Nah, nah, nah, nah.  We're going to take a break, Ant, because, uh, we have to debut our We Are the World.  Ah.  The Opie and Anthony, We Are the World, right after the break.  We're definitely going to do that, so please stay ready. 
[01:13:00]  Um, also, uh, let me, I'll do this correction.  It was Juneau Beach that the Canadians had in, um, uh, Normandy on D-Day.  Um, situated between sword and gold.  Okay, so it was in between.  Known as the Canadian Beach.  Assigned to the 3rd Canadian Infantry.  Um, da-da-da-da-da, the 3rd Canadian Division placed under the command of the British, uh,  Corps.  Yeah, they were under the British command, by the way.  Uh, da-da-da-da-da. 
[01:13:30]  I'd love, I'd love to know how that one went.  Uh, uh, uh, um, um, um, how many, how many casualties?  I don't know.  I'll look it up.  Yeah.  I'm going to do a little more research.  You're going to do all that research during the break.  Let's see.  Also, Boner's parents walking off Larry King.  We found the audio that someone turned us on to.  Good.  More info on, uh, the SeaWorld thing.  With, uh, what was his name again?  Uh, Tilla, Tilla Cum?  Tilla Cum.  Tilla Cum.  They call it Tilly. 
[01:14:00]  Will they be killing Tilla Cum?  Tilly.  We'll tell you after the break.  Oh, nice news tease.  Thank you.  But right after the break, our version of We Are the World.  Stay there.  Hi, Opie and Anthony show.  It's a snow day.  Yay!  We're all here.  Everybody but Steve C.  is still, I guess, is, uh... 
[01:14:30]  Do we have a distance report on Steve C. yet?  He was at 100 feet, uh, away from his house because of the snow here in New York.  Um, 100 and...  What do you think about?  10, 15 feet?  I'm still trying.  I would say 107.  107 feet.  Yes.  I don't think he's gonna make it in.  No?  I don't think he's gonna make it in today.  He's gonna try. 
[01:15:00]  Steve trying means he's not gonna make it in.  Have we heard from him?  No.  Hasn't called back.  No.  Oopsie.  I've gone back to bed.  I've left my Prius in the snow.  I had to make it back.  It was white-out conditions.  Well, we have a giant fucking debut today, by the way.  Yeah, it's time for the premiere.  Man.  It's the only reason we came to work today.  Yeah. 
[01:15:30]  Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.  So, Sam, what do we got going on?  We made our own version of We Are the World.  You and Troy and the guys behind the scenes have been working on this for the last two weeks, I think.  Yes.  Week and a half, whatever.  This is a giant undertaking.  The, the initial We Are the World, of course, you know, that was back in, what, 85, 25 years ago.  25 years ago, so for the 25th anniversary, they got together a whole new group of the stars du jour and some classic stars. 
[01:16:00]  Got them in the studio and did a new version.  And we listened and went, ha ha, are you kidding me?  We could do better than that.  Mm-hmm.  So we gathered up the various lunatics, psychopaths, losers, loners, homeless, and, of course, just some of the characters from the show.  And, uh, did, did our own version for the 25th anniversary. 
[01:16:30]  And this song is historic for two reasons.  Ooh.  Oh, okay.  Number one, it may, we still have to confirm this, it may be the longest produced bit in O&A history.  Ooh, which means we like it.  Yeah.  See, you can play it three or four times.  Nice.  How about, it's the first produced bit in over five, five, of seven years.  Yeah, that's another one.  That's another record.  We haven't produced a bit in over seven years.  Wow.  Number two, we believe it to be the first produced bit that all three members, Opie Anthony and Jim Norton of the show, are on. 
[01:17:00]  Actually on?  Wow.  Which means we were able to get all three members after the show to record something.  Holy shit.  So give yourselves a round of applause.  What a huge undertaking that is.  Did any of us have their coats off?  Okay.  No.  Yeah, that's true.  We all did our parts with our coats on.  I was actually holding my bag in my hand. 
[01:17:30]  Yeah.  Well, my scrotum, not my.  Of course.  Yeah, because I sing better that way.  There will be a video.  Really, all parts were filmed.  Fantastic.  This will be an official video?  An official video.  Ooh.  There will be a video.  Will it be edited nicely with some nice fade, trans, you know, because I want this thing to look really professional.  Yeah, I just have to get some, like, mountainous B-roll and some e-rolls and stuff.  Oh, that would be good.  And how about starving children?  And some starving children. 
[01:18:00]  Okay, Iraq.  And, well.  Wow.  That's what I mean, starving children.  Yeah.  I just get him in the office grabbing his belly.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Just get people with hunger pain.  Wow.  So, now this was weeks in the making.  Yeah.  I mean, we had the idea when, as soon as We Are the World 25 was announced, we started brainstorming.  Yeah.  We decided to wait until the release of the song so we could get a feel for it. 
[01:18:30]  Uh-huh.  Once we played it on the air here, we knew it was time to start working.  Do we have a list of the participants, or can you, off the top of your head, name some of the giant celebrities and stars from this very program that participated in this historic event, I would call it?  Well, I mean, you'll hear Anthony and Opie, of course.  Wow, yes.  Uncle Paul.  Ah.  Ted Sheckler.  Ted Sheckler.  Must have been hard getting him in.  Yeah.  Lyle Chip Chipperson is on it. 
[01:19:00]  Oh, Lyle Chip Chipperson.  Boo!  Homeless Mustard.  Stalker Patty.  Oh, well, time.  Yes, we heard that.  Yeah, great.  Big A.  Big A.  Robo.  Roland.  Roland!  The Virus.  Wait a minute.  The Virus.  The Virus is on it.  Tank Hankerous is on it.  Isn't that redundant?  Well, Tank Hankerous and the Virus appear back-to-back on the song. 
[01:19:30]  That's awesome.  All right, I'm going to really have to keep an ear open to see when the change happens, because  I've noticed, can you say one trick pony as far as voice impressions go?  It's just a different voice with the same material.  And if you keep your ears open, there's some voices from the past towards the end of the  song.  I think people are going to have to listen to this a couple of times to pick up on everybody  that's in this.  Oh, absolutely.  Wasn't that the fun of the original We Are the World?  I think that's Steve Perry. 
[01:20:00]  There was nothing fun about it.  I think, no, no, nothing at all.  What am I saying?  Hopefully ours brings a little fun.  And I've listened to it several times already, and what's fun is the way it's produced in  the chorus, everybody's separated, and some people pan to the left, some to the right,  so you can hear the separate voices.  So every time you listen, you can listen for someone else's voice.  Are you trying to tell me that this is a stereo?  Stereo?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, sorry.  Sorry, pal, dog people. 
[01:20:30]  You're only getting right.  So you're missing half the song.  You'll miss some voices.  Yes.  Well, let's do it, man.  Listen to it on satellite.  Go fuck yourselves.  Yeah, exactly.  Help us out.  Get a little satellite.  Are we ready for this?  I am.  Do we have the big production piece to tell everyone once again how great we are?  Oh, good.  Because we tell everyone how great we are every morning, right?  That's what we do.  Go listen to Obi and Anthony.  Hey, they say how great they are.  I like that. 
[01:21:00]  That ought to be a promo.  Yeah, I think it should be a promo.  Yeah.  We're not allowed to play other people's audio, unfortunately.  Well, we'll just make it a promo for ourselves.  Let's play the production piece and let's do this.  The premiere of the Obi and Anthony version of We Are the World.  And now, the Obi and Anthony show proudly presents We Are the World.  The world premiere of Obi and Anthony's We Are the World.  That's it? 
[01:21:30]  That's a bit.  And then you guys go, whoa.  A lot of explosions.  A lot of explosions.  But no lasers.  But no lasers.  There's explosions.  There's some explosions.  I like explosions, but no lasers.  There's some reverb on the voice.  It should have been a little more over the top, I'm thinking.  A little more lasers.  It sounds like someone threw that piece together last minute because they didn't really want  to do it for us.  Yes.  Somebody didn't want to do it.  Really?  Yes.  Really?  Just was annoyed that we were bothering them.  Yeah.  Here's the song.  Here's the song. 
[01:22:00]  There comes a time when we hear a sudden call, when the world must stand together as one. 
[01:22:30]  There are people dying.  It's time we lend a hand to life.  The greatest gift of all.  We can't go on pretending day by day that someone somehow will soon make a change. 
[01:23:00]  We are all a part of God's great big family.  And the truth, you know, love is all we need.  We are the world.  We are the children.  We are the ones who make a brighter day. 
[01:23:30]  So let's start giving.  There's a choice we're making.  We are the ones who make a brighter day.  Why?  Why?  Why?  You know, you think I know the lyrics to this already.  Accept your heart so they know that someone cares.  So they cries for help will not be in pain. 
[01:24:00]  We can't let them suffer.  No, we can't tell them the way to something.  Right now, they need a helping hand or foot or maybe shoulders.  Let's say, Melon.  We are the children.  We are the ones who make a brighter day.  So let's start giving.  There's a choice we're making. 
[01:24:30]  Yes, we're saving our own lives.  It's true.  We'll make a gayer day.  Just you and me.  See, I'm gay.  Well, you're down and down.  And there seems no hope at all.  But if you just believe, there's no way we could fall.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Let us realize that a change can only come. 
[01:25:00]  When we stand together as one.  Give yourself a feel.  We are the world.  We are the children.  We are the ones who make a brighter day.  So let's start giving.  Let's start giving.  There's a choice we're making.  We're saving our own lives.  It's true. 
[01:25:30]  We'll make a better day.  Just you and me.  We are the ones who make a brighter day.  So let's start giving.  There's a choice we're making.  We're saving our own lives.  It's true.  We'll make a better day.  Just you and me.  We are the ones who make a brighter day. 
[01:26:00]  We are the ones who make a brighter day.  We are the ones who make a brighter day.  So let's start giving.  We are the ones who make a brighter day.  There's a choice we're making.  We're trying to save our own lives.  It's true.  We'll make a better day.  Just you and me.  Come on now.  Let me hear you.  We are the world. 
[01:26:30]  We are the children.  We are the ones who make a brighter day.  So let's...  Let's start giving.  We are the ones who make a brighter day.  We are the ones who make a brighter day.  We are the ones who make a brighter day.  So let's start giving.  Let's start giving.  And a lot of older people who are doing it too.  You know folks, there's a lot of big dicks in the world. 
[01:27:00]  And I blew a lot of them.  And I'll tell you, big dicks leave a bad taste in my mouth.  We are the ones who make a brighter day. 
[01:27:30]  Wow.  I, um...  I'm stupefied.  What do you think?  What do you think?  I'm too tearing...  I'm tearing up here at the beauty.  Well, bravo to Sam and Troy and everyone else.  What a production piece that is.  And the funny thing is, Club Soda Kenny was really, really mad that you were auto-tuning  him.  Auto-tuning him.  But that could be the best part of the whole fucking song. 
[01:28:00]  I love the auto-tune part.  It's fantastic.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  Well, we're going to have to play that a few more times.  Epic.  We have to make it available for a download somewhere.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah?  Yeah, but only the difference is, we will pay you to download it instead of the way it  usually works.  Well, uh...  Fucking greatest fucking song fucking ever.  That's one awful me from Wackbag.  Of course.  Blue Healer.  It's not the clusterfuck I thought it would be. 
[01:28:30]  I don't know if that's good or bad.  I think that's a good review.  I want an iTunes link now.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We got to get that out.  That's Coco in the D.  Please don't play that again.  I'm ashamed for you.  It sounds like a zoo crew when you fabulous.  I don't know.  All right.  Punch it out.  Sounds like the Muppets show.  Kind of did.  A little bit.  A little Muppet-y.  What's wrong with that?  That's what they sound like.  Yeah.  It's just what they sound like.  They sound like Muppets.  Uh, let's see. 
[01:29:00]  Thank God you guys don't do bits anymore.  How many guest Muppets did you get from Sesame Street?  Wow.  I don't know Muppets.  Redding says that's a piece of shit and the funniest piece of shit ever.  Oh, good.  Kenny with the auto-tune was funny.  Mm-hmm.  So, you're going to have to hear it again.  There's a lot of people in there.  Yeah.  Like, I heard Tim at the end.  Yes.  That has to be a little bit of a surprise from our K-Rock days.  You know, the, oh, now, guy.  A simple two-word review coming in.  Shit sandwich. 
[01:29:30]  Shit sandwich.  Again, I don't know if that's good or bad.  Yes, K-Rock.  There's one point towards the end of the song where everybody's in the chorus.  If you listen real closely, right after they sing We Are the World, Uncle Paul goes,  let's take our clothes off.  See, it's those little moments.  I didn't hear it, so you're going to have to hear it again now.  There's also Uncle Paul.  He has another line.  It's hidden in there, but he says, there's a choice we're making.  We're ruining all their lives.  I didn't hear that either.  It's in there.  See, that's fantastic. 
[01:30:00]  We'll play it.  We'll definitely play it again in a little while.  We're going to play it two more times during the show just so people could listen to it.  Bill in Texas, what's up?  Whoa, Bill.  Hello, ONA Party Rock.  Awesome, guys.  Awesome.  I want to know, where do I send the check?  Yeah, I know.  People just hear that, and they just want to donate to something.  Yeah, that is the best piece of work I've ever heard, guys.  You know, as a goof, we wanted to put it online and make people download it for whatever. 
[01:30:30]  Yeah.  And really send the money to charity, but we found out we're not allowed to do that.  How come we're not allowed?  They don't want our money, I guess.  How come we're not allowed to do that, though?  Once again, a charity doesn't want our money.  I wonder why we're not allowed to do that.  Just as a goof.  We put it up on iTunes.  People would download it just to help the damn Haiti thing out, or maybe we do it, you  know, for help out America or something.  Or something.  Why not?  But they said no, because why?  We can never help.  We don't own the rights to the music.  Yeah, but we'll get fucking Quincy Jones on the phone.  It's charity. 
[01:31:00]  That's what I would think.  I mean, we're actually using the money.  And it's parody.  It's parody charity.  Yeah.  So parody, you can do it.  Parody charity.  Parody's like protected, right?  What?  Hello?  Yeah.  Hold on.  Steven asks from Bayshore, exactly how long is that song?  It seemed to last about 19 minutes.  Wayne and Boss and Bobo was just excellent.  Give him the nod.  Oh.  Sounds a lot like the retarded version of Hungry Eyes.  That's good.  Keith from Philly, I heard Uncle Paul scream children. 
[01:31:30]  Yes.  I love how brilliantly it was edited for the chorus.  It sounded like everyone stepped all over each other.  Fucking hilarious.  Yeah, it really was.  Just a clusterfuck.  When are you going to play the ONA version?  Where is the video?  This guy just writes, blink, blink, humpbacks.  Bravo, boys.  Those fuckers can produce.  Yeah.  So I don't know.  I don't know.  A lot more positive than negative coming in on this one.  If you ask me, I say it's a hit.  I think it's a hit.  And I think the people that are bitching about it are haters.  Well, yeah. 
[01:32:00]  They're just haters.  And Evan from Fort Drum.  The small change in E-Rogg's voice with Tank Hankles and the virus was fucking hysterical.  Yeah, that, my favorite part right there is the virus and Tank Hankers and the absolute impossibility of distinguishing the two.  But that's the beauty of a song like this is everybody's going to have a different favorite part and your favorite parts are going to change.  Yeah, yes.  And then you'll notice things that you missed the first 18 times.  People picking up on Poe got in there with us.  A little us was in there. 
[01:32:30]  I wanted to laugh, but I cried.  It was that touching.  What happened to super-affected mustard?  Mustard sounded fucking great.  Yeah.  I guess we got a nice version of mustard this time around.  He was our Bieber.  He didn't do that, though.  He went straight forward.  It's hidden in the chorus.  Yeah, it's hidden in the chorus.  Great job, Troy Kwan and Sam.  I love the...  Yeah, okay.  We did that one.  Tippi Tom made it.  What was it?  Tippi Tom was in the end.  I just pulled him.  I put him in singing If You Want My Body.  See, I didn't even notice that part. 
[01:33:00]  I really got to...  I'm going to have to listen.  And I didn't notice Tippi Tom in there.  A tribute.  He used the last voice.  Instead of an official video, Blue Heeler, I think everyone's thinking this.  Coke Logic's got to animate that.  That would be a motherfucker.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, that would be quite an undertaking.  We can put up a video of the recording to give Coke Logic some time to animate it.  Okay, we'll do that.  Oh, would that be amazing.  Listen to the words, man.  Why did Tank Hanker sound like the cookie monster?  Reverend Al wants to know. 
[01:33:30]  A little bit.  Yeah, yeah, a little bit.  That's, I guess, what the Muppet thing was.  Love Big A getting stuck in the word start.  Yeah, that was good.  He finally got it out as the other person was already singing.  The entire chorus had started.  Yeah, the chorus had started, and he finally got his line out.  Showing from Albany, Georgia.  Tim being back equals best part.  Finally, something that ranks lower on Rotten Tomatoes than Cop Out.  Oh, wow.  These are retard singing, and that's a motion picture.  What is Cop Out up to now?  We told you we don't have time to talk about Cop Out today. 
[01:34:00]  I hate when that happens.  I just want to see what it's up to on Rotten Tomatoes.  I really wanted to talk about Cop Out on our radio show, but we just don't have time.  It's snowed here.  We have so much going on.  Yeah.  All right.  It ticked up a notch.  All right.  It went from 13% to 14%.  It went from 13% to 14%.  Let's see.  I'm absolutely crying.  The review's just coming in.  You want some phone calls?  Oh, who doesn't?  After this, please.  Let's go to Keith the Trucker.  Keith.  Hey, Keith.  Yeah, guy.  I'm absolutely crying over here.  That was fucking hysterical, man.  They started off so serious and sweet with the homeless dude, and they all went to shit 
[01:34:30]  and they happened.  That was fucking great.  I love it.  Kenny coming in right after that is just...  That was perfect.  ...really set the mood.  That was perfect.  My favorite part might be Kenny Auto-Tune.  Yeah.  Fucking great job, Sam.  You need a pay raise, dude.  Yeah.  We got to get him saying so many.  The overuse of the Auto-Tune, too, was really good.  Of course.  It was not subtle.  Yeah, it was not a subtle use of...  Kenny was walking around here dead serious, shaking his head like, I don't want to be  Auto-Tuned.  You're ruining my magic. 
[01:35:00]  He doesn't understand how great it is to have him Auto-Tuned.  He made me sign a napkin that said he would receive $1,000 in cash if he were Auto-Tuned.  So I made him record it, and then I wiped my ass with a napkin.  Oh, good.  Let's say hi to Trucker Brendan.  Trucker Brendan.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I fucking love it.  Opie, I heard you.  Kenny Auto-Tuned is excellent, just like he did in Fireflies.  Anthony, did you have a solo?  I was doing the, if you notice, the pseudo-Bruce Springsteen yelling in the chorus. 
[01:35:30]  That was awesome.  The, we are the world!  He also did Steve C.  Yeah.  That was not the actual Steve C.  Yeah, I think he did Steve C.  Steve C, boys.  Yay.  I got you.  See, everyone's saying they would definitely pay, like, whatever, a dollar or two on iTunes.  And we wouldn't want the money.  We'd fucking make some money for some dumb charity.  Well, I'll see, I'll talk to the lawyers and see if there's any way to get it up.  Oh, the lawyers.  Well, that'll be great. 
[01:36:00]  They'll probably make it so we can't even play it on the air.  Yeah, matter of fact.  That's what they'll do.  As a matter of fact, don't play it on the air.  Destroy any copy of it and kill everyone involved with it.  Thank you.  They're still deciding if we could replay the Homeless Charlie bit, by the way.  That's what the lawyers have been up to for the last two weeks.  They're knocking that one around like it's a fucking trial of the century.  It's just a throwaway.  Like, you know what?  It's time to replay Homeless Charlie that got us almost fired and suspended for 30 days.  Yeah.  And they're still batting it around, deciding if we could replay something that already aired, by the way. 
[01:36:30]  You know, so many people are saying they would absolutely pay 99 cents for it if it goes to charity.  You know something?  We've got to figure out a way.  We should.  We could look like good guys for once.  There is no one ever wants our charity money.  I know.  There was one...  Get the black Homeless Minority fucking...  Yeah, Minority Vietnam Vets.  Yeah, get them.  They'll take our money.  There was one person who had a chance to be on this recording...  And said no?  ...that flaked out.  Who? 
[01:37:00]  Shitty Intern David.  What the fuck is with that guy?  He just no-showed and stopped responding to emails.  Wow.  And that was actually Club...  He was supposed to follow Muster, and Club Soda County got his lines.  Someone better go to Central Park.  He might be dead like Boners did.  Oh, maybe he's a Coen, or a Coan, or whatever it's called.  Coan, whatever Ian said yesterday.  We were also...  We tried to get a sax solo from Ian Halperin.  Oh, how great would that have been?  He said he was on location.  He's living out of his suitcase. 
[01:37:30]  We wanted one part of the song to go, ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Ian Halperin.  Oh, and a sax solo.  Oh, let's go to Reed in D.C.  Reed.  Maybe next 25 years anniversary, we'll do that.  Reed.  Gentlemen, that part of the song, Big A, getting hung up on...  Yeah.  We waited for him.  No, but he waited.  That really is funny, man.  I can't wait to hear it again, because I've got to pick up on some more shit.  Yeah.  Brian, Connecticut.  Guys, I loved it. 
[01:38:00]  Favorite part?  Give yourself a bill.  See, I missed that, too.  Really?  Wow.  Yeah, they didn't know what...  I'm listening to the call.  There's so much going on.  It was pretty sad when they realized they didn't know what I could do for the song.  I'm like, all right.  There were no characters.  Yeah, I do characters.  Mike in Buffalo.  Mike?  Mike?  Yes.  Uncle Paul can sing, and when did Ted Sheckler get out of the shower and start singing?  You guys should give Ted Sheckler a record deal. 
[01:38:30]  That's true.  Ted, really powerful voice on Ted, by the way.  Because he was actually...  He had to be brought down in the chorus, because he overpowered everybody.  Ted was overpowering everybody.  That Ted Sheckler does like to sing.  Well, I'll tell you this much.  A lot of people are commenting about the damn thing.  Yeah.  It's a newsmaker.  I love it.  I know.  When's the news going to pick this up?  I don't know.  Yeah.  Can we give it to another channel around here?  Any channels? 
[01:39:00]  This is...  Willing to play our version of We Are the World?  What about the morning mashup?  They should play it.  The morning mashup probably would play it, except for that Sandy Kane line in the end.  You know, folks, there's a lot of big dicks in the world.  We have to get a radio edit.  Yeah.  Where it's beeped.  Yeah.  And I've blown a lot of people.  And I've blown a lot of people.  Why does she have to tell that story?  Like, why did she just come out and tell that story?  I just went around the room, and I was like, all right, guys, just give me some ad-libs  and stuff.  I was like, Sandy, give me, like, a dick joke.  Give me something.  And she just starts going, you know, folks. 
[01:39:30]  Ah, I suck a lot of dicks.  But she sells it perfectly.  She's great.  She does.  She's great.  You know?  Of course she does.  Uh, oh, what the fuck?  We missed...  Oh, Ron in Toronto.  Ron.  Yeah, it's Ron from Toronto.  I was waiting for my toodley-doo, so...  Yeah, what happened to the toodley-doo?  I thought that was going to make it in there.  Yeah, we never got a toodley-doo.  I just thought it would be too much.  Yeah.  To tell you the truth.  It was a lot that we had to leave out, because there was so much to put in.  Just so much in there.  It would have been buried and just a mish-mash. 
[01:40:00]  It's just a perfect mix of the talent and the music.  Yeah.  I think you hit it right on the head.  And we can always remix it.  Yeah.  And you never were going to get me twice to go into that fucking studio.  I think that was the main problem.  When I was racing toward the elevator.  We almost got blown off the first time.  We were not going to get a second time.  That is true.  That is true.  Chicago, what do you got today, buddy?  Hey, that was brilliant, man.  I loved it.  See?  Cool.  I was wondering if maybe you guys could put a list out of, like, who's on there,  because there's, like, so much stuff going by. 
[01:40:30]  Sam, can you give me...  Yeah.  Give me a...  You know, I'll put it on my Twitter.  Well, we'll put it on all our Twitters, because I don't know who you guys are following.  Some are...  Whatever.  Give me a list in order of who appears, and I'll at least...  Tweet that before we play it again in the next...  We'll play it again, like, real soon.  Okay.  We'll play it again at 9 o'clock.  How's that?  That's huge.  I was not in the room with Sandy Cain and Mustard at the same time.  No.  No, we all kind of did it separately.  I did my parts alone.  There was only one recording where you had about six or eight guys in the fishbowl. 
[01:41:00]  And then after that, it was everyone just doing it individually, and then they kind of  did a little copy-paste action.  I didn't check my ego at the door.  You...  Opie, Anthony, Jim, and Kenny all required solo recording sessions.  Solo performances.  Sam, you tell them.  And that I don't...  I don't...  I'm not a fucking seal.  Right.  I'm not a Mr. fucking tap dance boy for you.  And Tim Reed was sent in because he's not a lot on premises.  Oh, is that what happened? 
[01:41:30]  Yeah, it wasn't.  Jesus.  A lot on premises.  Let's say hi to Q in New Orleans.  Q.  What up, boys?  Hey, buddy.  Q.  First of all, I got to say, Quincy Jones, that's how you can produce.  Yeah.  All right?  And this is you guys' Star Trek, all right?  The hardcore fans will love it.  They'll get all the little tidbits, but it's very accessible to the common person on the  street.  Yeah.  Yeah, right on.  You don't have to be a fan to appreciate the brilliance and beauty and majesty of that song. 
[01:42:00]  Safe to say, I think we have the second best version of the We Are the World song.  I think so.  And a lot of people out there are doing their own versions.  Yes.  I think this beats the right...  There's the first version, there's this version, and then there's the 25th anniversary.  Yeah, which is forgettable.  Yeah.  This one, though.  Wow.  People are asking, where was Larry King?  Like Sam said, and we can't fit it all in, unfortunately.  I mean, we could have done We Are the World with just Anthony doing voices.  Which we still could do.  Well, that's a very short walk from the studio to the elevator. 
[01:42:30]  It would take a while.  It's very difficult.  Yeah.  Well, Corinne has something on this.  Corinne in Jersey.  Corinne.  Guys, I laughed.  I cried.  I threw up in my mouth a little bit.  Yeah.  That's the feeling everybody's getting.  This is what we try to do, is get people to react.  I don't care which way you react.  Just react.  Emotions.  Tim, Toronto.  Enough of these Toronto calls today.  Jesus, do you have anything to do up there today?  Amazing.  Oh, well, we're stuck in a big pile of snow, so. 
[01:43:00]  All right.  In the club.  I'd call in.  But, you know, Chip Trepperson gets a lot of shit on the show for, like, lame-ass jokes  and whatnot.  Really?  You have the funniest line in the whole song with the whole lend a hand, lend a foot.  Shoulders.  Shoulders.  Something.  Stop me on my track.  Perhaps.  Perhaps.  Came out of nowhere.  It was hilarious.  Awesome.  All right.  That was ad-libbed, too, by Chip.  That was not written for him.  Wow.  Yep.  Chip ad-libbed.  I don't have much writing.  I think everything he says is ad-lib, so.  No, it was great.  The whole song, everything was fantastic. 
[01:43:30]  All right.  Good job, guys.  And you know what?  Let's not get crazy, though.  Let's not all of a sudden start producing bits for this show.  That's, you know.  Yeah, yeah.  We need to do that.  We were thinking that maybe we would start bringing you guys in a lot more.  Like, you and Ant could start being in a lot more.  See, we have a formula that's worked over the years.  I wouldn't want to fuck with it.  Where you guys just go home.  Exactly.  Okay.  We come in.  Yeah.  We do the minimal possible.  Then we leave.  See, that's a formula that's worked for years.  I mean, you're very successful.  It's hard to argue that.  Yes, why fuck the whole thing up by, you know, producing bits, calming it, stay late. 
[01:44:00]  I'm saying late.  Early, late.  Early, late.  And how funny is it to look at Sam and see that he has to really work hard?  Oh, I know.  I know.  Look at him.  You're in that stage.  It's fun.  He works hard.  Enjoy it.  Ew.  Ew.  Ew.  Troy and I were sending versions of this song back and forth until like 9 o'clock at night  last night.  Oh, Jesus.  Making sure it was just so.  I was so bored.  I thought I was trying to figure out what I could do last night. 
[01:44:30]  I was so.  Yeah.  I was just so bored.  I'm like, man, I have nothing to do.  Well, I mean, maybe I could have helped out.  Brian in Massachusetts.  Brian.  Yes.  I, uh, I'm sitting at my desk right now listening and I think I'm about to get fired.  I'm laughing so loud.  Yeah.  That was, uh, very funny.  I just, when Kenny kicked in.  Yeah.  That really brought it right, right into your face.  Cause the music starts. 
[01:45:00]  Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.  And then Mustard.  Here comes the time.  Heed a certain call.  Da, da.  And then Kenny.  It's fucking great.  Yeah.  Well, we're going to take a break.  We're going to replay the song at nine o'clock.  Why not?  Look at you.  Look at you.  Just so you are now like a jock.  I'm trying it.  I like it.  Just so, uh, you can pick up on some of the things you missed.  Give me a list of all the people and how they appear in the song.  So, uh, we can tweet that so they can follow along as we play the song again. 
[01:45:30]  After the break, Boner's parents walk off.  Larry King will do your SeaWorld update.  Uh, Steven Tyler news.  Stone Temple Pilots news.  Don't have time to talk about this cop-out movie, unfortunately.  Very, very busy today, Anthony.  Oh, damn.  Extremely busy.  We would love to, obviously.  I know.  We would love to do the right thing, but we just don't have time for that today.  Talk about Tracy.  Uh, and other things.  Stay there.  Opie and Anthony.  What do you got over there, Ed?  Some breaking news?  I was just looking at the, uh, uh, Idol news. 
[01:46:00]  You know, American Idol news.  And, uh, it says, you may be upset or relieved to hear the news that, uh, Howard Stern definitely  won't be joining American Idol, um, as, uh, judge replacing Simon Cowell.  According to sources close to the show, the new judge will be announced at the end of the  current run, and, um, whoever gets the gig will have a sweet deal.  Uh, but, uh, no.  That won't be happening. 
[01:46:30]  Well, you gotta give, uh, Howard a lot of credit.  He's the biggest bullshit artist in radio.  Well, it's...  And I give him credit for that, for real, because, uh, he's got people that know how to plant  fake stories that the mainstream media, because they know the mainstream media in general,  is a bunch of dummies.  Yeah, they pick up on it.  So, they come up with a bullshit fucking lie.  He's got the right people to feed it to the proper people.  And then it becomes this big, huge, over-the-top thing.  Yep.  And now, uh, I guess, uh, that can't be used as far as a tool, uh, here. 
[01:47:00]  Yeah.  As far as certain, um, yeah, things go.  Wow.  The ONA We Are The World song, which we're gonna play again in about 20 minutes, features  Mustard, then Club Soda Kenny, then Roland, then Uncle Paul, then Tank Hankerus, then The  Virus, Stalker Patty, Lyle Chip Chipperson, Bobo, Steve C, Big A, Pat from Winnocky, Ted  Sheckler, Opie, Sandy Kane, Auto-Tune Kenny, Master Poe, Annoying Guy from K-Rock, which 
[01:47:30]  was, uh, Tim, Bobo Springsteen, and then Tippy Tom.  Mm.  Wow.  And this list will be online in a few minutes.  And then you could listen and try to, you know, pick out who they are.  Yeah.  Oh, that was so much fun 25 years ago, doing that with the original.  Was it?  Not really.  So, Bobo, uh, not Bobo, wow.  I almost said Bobo was found dead.  But, wow, that would have got people talking. 
[01:48:00]  Uh, Boner.  God needed somebody with a broken wiener.  Uh, Boner's dead.  Yeah.  They found him in a park.  They're not, uh, saying how he killed himself, but there's no doubt that he took his own life,  right?  Yes.  And, oh, Captain, it was Khan.  I bet it was Khan.  You think it was Khan?  Khan killed, uh, actually, no, uh, it could have been a, um, a Klingon.  Uh, because a Klingon did kill Kirk's son, uh, which left Kirk very bitter against the 
[01:48:30]  Klingons, uh, which came out in a later, uh, episode, uh, movie, Undiscovered Country.  Um, or I believe that, yes, Undiscovered Country.  Uh, but, uh, Chekhov, who was Boner's father, um, he, uh, uh, was very upset about this whole  thing.  He was supposed to do Larry King, and, uh, walked off.  Yeah, here's some audio.  Um, actor Andrew Koenig, best known for his role in the series Growing Pains, has been 
[01:49:00]  missing since February 14th, Valentine's Day.  Vancouver police believe he may be in the area.  Kirk Cameron, who starred in Growing Pains, has publicly urged Andrew to call him.  Andrew's parents, Walter and Judy Koenig, are in Vancouver helping police search for their  son.  And, uh, Walter may be familiar to you, he played Chekhov in the original Star Trek series.  Now, I'm told that, uh, they left the studio, so we'll take a quick break and come back and  find out why. 
[01:49:30]  Don't go away.  What's happened?  Well, I don't know.  How important is a guest in the chair?  How important is the intro if the guest isn't in the seat?  Very important, I would say.  Then he came back from break and did this.  Well, uh, folks, for some reason, unbeknownst to anyone, uh, Walter Koenig, the father of  the missing Andrew Koenig, and Judy Levitt Koenig, the missing, uh, the mother of the missing  Andrew Koenig, left the studio in Vancouver.  Unbeknownst to anyone. 
[01:50:00]  Unbeknownst.  This is why Larry King and the rest of the dumb mainstream media sucks.  Unbeknownst to anyone, maybe they're a bit distraught.  Yeah.  About the fact that their son is missing.  Unbeknownst.  I'm hearing from my staffers that they were standing in one place, there were sparkly lights, and  then they just disappeared.  Apparently, they beamed out of my studio.  Poor, poor Chekhov.  Unbeknownst to anyone.  Unbeknownst.  Really?  To anyone. 
[01:50:30]  Uh, the mother of the missing Andrew Koenig left the studio in Vancouver.  We checked them out.  They were prepared to go on.  I said hello.  They both said hello.  We said we'd be on in two minutes.  They said fine.  And they got up and left.  For reasons unknown.  So let me give you in the next minute and a half a little preview of, we've got a lot  covered tomorrow night.  Well, you were only going to give him a minute and a half.  We're going to give him a minute and a half.  Chekhov, why couldn't you just use a tricorder to find his life form? 
[01:51:00]  Find a human, set it for human life form.  Chekhov, do you think he's still on a Class M planet?  Could he be on Rigel 7?  Where did he, where do you think he go?  He went.  Can we just put him in a giant sunglasses case, shoot him onto the Genesis planet, and  pick him up later, and he'll be fine.  And then maybe help get some whales.  Could you do that? 
[01:51:30]  And take Tilikum up in a Klingon vessel.  Why can't you do that at work for Spock?  What happened?  How did you sit next to that homo Asian guy for so many years and not know he was a  cock smoker?  You skipped it.  I skipped it.  I can almost do it.  I skipped it.  Did DeForest Kelly call and tell you he was dead? 
[01:52:00]  See, that's what he always did.  Said he's dead.  Couldn't you just take him to sick bay and hold that salt shaker that goes boo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo over him?  Here, wait.  Did it do this?  Then he would have been better. 
[01:52:30]  Couldn't you give him one of those shots that go pshht in his neck and he'd wake up?  Do you think Chekhov will ask Kirk to take the Enterprise around the sun, whip it around to go back in time and pick up his son before he offed himself?  Comment, Chekhov.  Let's say hi to Larry King, Anthony. 
[01:53:00]  Larry!  Well, we know that Boner is missing, but now we have an exclusive on the Larry King show.  His parents are missing, we assume, with him.  But we can't find the groceries.  What happened to the groceries?  Larry King, what do you got on this?  Chekhov, can you confirm or deny that your pathetic son died searching for trisithium crystals?  Rape. 
[01:53:30]  Larry.  Chekhov, how important is your boner?  Apparently very.  You know, Chekhov was almost dead when he went to get some radiation from the Enterprise, the aircraft carrier.  If you remember, he was chased by the ship's crew and fell down one of the giant elevators that lift the fighter planes up.  And he was taken to the hospital, but Bones was able to cure him of his subdural hematoma. 
[01:54:00]  Bones, do you think you could cure Chekhov's son?  Wait, Bones is dead.  I'm getting, how important is Bones being alive to saving Chekhov's son?  Boner.  Boner.  Bones and Boner.  Coincidence?  I don't know.  It's unbeknownst to me.  Unbeknownst.  Unbeknownst.  To everyone.  Do you think he offed himself with the same weapon Kirk killed the Gorn with?  Did he find bamboo and sulfur and charcoal and diamonds and blow his head off with that? 
[01:54:30]  Boy, would that make a mess.  Does this make sense?  Was Boner killed by an enemy, Wessel?  Yes.  He would say Wessel all the time.  Okay, I don't know.  Unbelievable.  I don't really know this stuff.  He was a victim of his own self.  Maybe he OD'd on Waikaten. 
[01:55:00]  I'm not sure.  Let's say hi to Larry.  Larry King, everyone.  Hello, this is Larry King.  How important is the body's location?  Ah, apparently very.  That's where they found him.  What the hell does that mean?  Ah.  Was he taking Viagra?  You know, there is a chance perhaps he was using Romulan technology and just cloaked his 
[01:55:30]  body and disappeared.  Was there a cloaking device found on Boner?  Comment.  Chekhov, please.  I think I watched quite a few episodes.  I think you know that fucking Star Trek.  Larry.  Yes, was Boner fired out in a sunglass case?  That's what I said earlier, sir. 
[01:56:00]  Where were you?  Oh, no.  Let's say hi to Larry King.  Larry, this is the real Larry.  This is unbeknownst to me, but a question.  Could Cialis or Levitra retrieve your Boner?  Fucking Boner jokes.  If your Boner's missing, I would try Viagra.  It seems to bring back the Boner.  Larry King would be the greatest broadcaster ever if he did that.  Oh, wouldn't he?  Oh, my God. 
[01:56:30]  Did you try opening his dead mouth and putting in some garlic?  Or Welch's grape juice by intravenous?  It might have worked.  You never know.  And we did the, I guess God needed a Boner joke earlier.  Yes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Did you have a conversation with your doctor about your erectile dysfunction?  Larry just gets it all wrong, doesn't even know. 
[01:57:00]  That's a kid.  Boner was limp until rigor set in.  Then he was a stiff Boner.  Till he got to Gypsy.  I wish Gypsy was here.  Was he found with Abigail?  And Codeine?  And maybe some Anacin?  Anacin?  Let's say hi to Larry King. 
[01:57:30]  Larry.  Oh.  Yeah.  Is it true that the ABC execs wouldn't go for the nickname Hard-On?  Will Boner be written on the tombstone?  It's kind of embarrassing.  Cody from Indiana is very upset with our Larry King Boner bit.  Oh.  Yes, Cody.  You know what, guys?  Sometimes I think that it's just a little bit insensitive.  I had a Boner once, and I don't think it's a good thing to do to make fun of something like this. 
[01:58:00]  Well, I guess this one hit a little too close to home for you, Cody.  Yeah, probably.  I don't know what to tell you.  Sorry.  We don't really have an agenda on this show.  We apologize, so.  Sometimes it's going to hit a little too close to home, and I guess it's hitting too close to home to you today.  Okay.  Well, thank you.  All right.  Larry King.  Larry.  Good morning, gentlemen.  Good morning, Larry.  It was true when they found a Boner.  Rigor Mortis was already set in.  I suck.  I thought I just said that.  I suck.  I know.  I think I just did.  It is because I suck. 
[01:58:30]  Larry.  Yeah.  I was wondering if you're playing Bury Your Boner.  Oh, God.  Bury Your Boner.  Oh, is that terrible?  Well, I was just wondering if you're playing with your wife, if you're playing hot.  Yeah, we get it.  Yeah, we get it.  I don't know how to explain your great lies.  Rumor has it.  Is this true?  Was he found wearing a red security man's outfit from the Enterprise? 
[01:59:00]  They never seem to make it.  Larry.  Yes, I'm wondering why E-Rock killed this man at a show on Tuesday.  And does Kirk Cameron think he's going to hell?  Ah.  Yes, he's very religious.  Was there mental issues?  I'm hearing Boner was nuts.  Let's say hi to Larry King on line nine. 
[01:59:30]  This is really Larry.  Oh, yeah.  This is.  Hey, is it true that Boner lasted more than four hours and then they called the doctor?  Yeah, that is.  Yeah, you think Boner lasted four hours in that park?  No, you're supposed to.  You're supposed to, right?  You're supposed to call the doctor.  Let's say hi to Larry.  Larry?  I don't know what the big deal is.  I used to lose a Boner every day. 
[02:00:00]  Yes.  Fucking.  Ah.  Yeah.  When you put the word out for him to get home, were you hoping Boner would come?  Jesus.  Ta-dum-dum.  Let's say hi to Larry King.  Larry.  Yes, hello.  Hey, Larry.  Will they be erecting a memorial for Boner?  Well, something has to be erected for Boner. 
[02:00:30]  I do believe.  Is it true Boner was found in Steve C.'s mouth?  They're not giving actual reports on the exact location.  You think they put Boner in a body bag?  This is terrible.  The poor lad is dead.  Yeah.  Lad, he was, what, 35?  I was trying for eight.  The guy was Boner for years.  I was trying for a condom joke.  I might have fell short on that one.  Yeah.  Uh, let's say hi to Larry King. 
[02:01:00]  Larry.  Oh, Larry.  Yeah.  This is Larry.  Have you and your wife been able to kiss your Boner goodbye?  That's awful.  Yeah, someone, uh, X-I-A-D-O-X on Twitter.  Poor Boner.  This is going to be hard on his family.  Let's go to Larry King on Line 9.  Larry.  Yes, I like that.  The question is, uh, Boner a cocky young boy.  Yeah.  He was always a little cocky. </pre>
