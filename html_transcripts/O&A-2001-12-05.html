<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opens with the hosts celebrating their "Best Afternoon Drive Show in America" award, despite admitting to years of essentially "winging it."  Much of the show is dedicated to a game where listeners guess which program directors (PDs) are complaining about the show.  Buffalo's PD receives praise for his support, while Boston's PD is heavily targeted for his perceived negativity, particularly concerning the cancellation of Adam Ferrara's show, "The Job."  Upcoming guests are announced: Jay Moore, Olympic hockey gold medalist Jim Craig, and Sandy Kane (for "What The Hell Is That?").  Adam Ferrara is in-studio, participating in discussions about video games, specifically "Castle Wolfenstein."  A significant portion focuses on the upcoming "Homeless Shopping Spree 2," scheduled for Tuesday, including a humorous and vulgar phone call with Tippi Tom, a homeless man participating in the event.  Clips from previous Shopping Sprees, notably featuring Ziggy's adventures (including a Versace suit fitting after a urine incident and subsequent mugging), are played.  A caller recounts a story about her father who sounds strikingly like Tippi Tom.

Jim Craig makes a surprise in-studio appearance, discussing his post-Olympic life, motivational speaking, and Allstate-sponsored hockey clinics.  The hosts engage in banter with Craig,  Anna Kournikova, Serena Williams, and callers including Pete Radovich (who interviewed Craig) and a youth hockey coach.  The "What The Hell Is That?" segment is previewed, focusing on listeners with unusual medical conditions (a third nipple, a "cauliflower balloon knot").  The conversation shifts to Geraldo Rivera's Afghanistan reporting, with callers expressing disapproval.  The show also covers a young American fighting for the Taliban, eliciting various reactions from the hosts and callers.

A lengthy and darkly humorous call with Earl, a listener hospitalized in the ICU due to internal bleeding, follows.  Earl describes his hospital room, including a flat-lining patient and an Asian medical staff providing a sponge bath.  His uncertain prognosis is discussed.  The conversation is marked by frequent vulgar language and sexually suggestive comments.  The recurring "Turn Down the Radio Guy" bit, created by Dan, is featured.  Further discussion on upcoming comedy shows from Adam Ferrara, Jay Moore, and Earl takes place. A clip from a previous segment showing Earl's inept office measuring task – an event purportedly leading to his ICU stay – is played.

The "What Did We Learn?" segment features numerous listener calls with crude and humorous anecdotes, often involving off-color jokes about race, homelessness, and sexuality.  The show concludes with Tippi Tom performing "Jingle Bells."


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Anthony, congratulations to you, my friend.  Why am I to be congratulated?  Well, you're one half of the best afternoon drive show in America.  Oh, well then, congratulations to you, too.  Voted by Friday morning quarterback.  Oh, one of the huge radio trade publications.  Probably the biggest trade publication.  So even though we just wing it and we don't show prep,  we won another award for being the best afternoon drive show in America. 
[00:00:30]  Thank you.  You effing tool.  No, it's not Ken Stevens.  That's a GM.  Get real here, people.  You're guessing socks.  Oh, please.  It's not a different station.  Oh, please.  Anyway.  No, it's not Tim Sabian.  No, we love the Tim Sabian.  He stands behind us.  He gets it.  He understands.  I do know that this certain PD called him up, though, 
[00:01:00]  and was bitching and complaining to him about us.  He's bitching and complaining to everybody.  God, stop your friggin' whining.  Ugh.  Unbelievable.  But even though we suck, don't show prep.  Just wing it.  Yeah.  We're the best afternoon drive show again.  How'd that happen?  I don't know.  Ass monkey.  Jay, what's going on today?  What's up, fellas?  Hey.  I just wanted to know what you guys thought of Raw, what they've been doing on Raw lately. 
[00:01:30]  With the what?  The Kiss My Ass Club?  With Ric Flair and his saggy tees and...  Uh, I'm thinking Raw lately.  Ever since they brought back Ric Flair and the whole Kiss My Ass Club and stuff.  And Jerry Lawler rules.  That guy, that guy rules.  And bringing back Jerry the King Lawler.  Yes.  Oh, we're a little distracted right now, Jay.  Thank you.  All right, bro.  Bye.  Look at Tim from the Bronx.  He says, the stock market and the record industry are bombing also because they don't show prep, I guess. 
[00:02:00]  Mike, what's going on?  Hey, boys.  Hey.  I think I guess who it is.  Oh.  He's a guy from Chicago.  The Chicago PD.  Oh, we forgot about Chicago.  Are we still on in Chicago?  I don't even know.  Last I remember, we were being preempted for minor league hockey, so...  That's the last...  Wrong!  Try again, dumbass!  No, it is not Chicago.  Well, Chicago does have another stupid program, director.  They think that minor league hockey is more important than the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:02:30]  A city that has NHL hockey.  So...  But no, no.  We have no problems with Chicago because we, quite frankly, we forgot about them.  Yeah.  Thank you, Mike.  Not a problem, boys.  All right.  Later.  No, it's not Bob Buckman.  That's funny.  Hey, Mark on Instant Feedback.  Hello?  Mark on Instant Feedback.  Mark on Instant Feedback, got it? 
[00:03:00]  Yeah.  Nice.  Kenny, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I want to say, if you guys are looking for recognition in your industry, you're not going  to get it.  It's just the genre of what you do.  You're not going to get it.  Recognition?  No, no.  Dude, you're getting it all wrong.  We're not looking for recognition.  If it comes to recognition, we just got it.  We just won Best Afternoon Drive show.  No, but...  And radio.  The public will never acknowledge it.  No, no, no, no.  Dude, the one won't acknowledge it?  The public, like the media.  No, we're not talking...  Dude, were you listening? 
[00:03:30]  We're talking about a program director that runs a station that we are on.  I mean, Jeremy?  That we are on, no.  No, that is an idiot, doesn't understand this program, and is now bitching to all the  other PDs about this show.  Well, you guys just do what you do, and you do a good job, so screw them.  That's exactly what we're doing.  Sure.  Thank you.  Thank you.  All right.  All right, Kenny.  I agree.  It makes a good point, though.  Yeah.  Why should we let this idiot bother us? 
[00:04:00]  Ha!  No, it isn't in New Orleans.  New Orleans?  No.  That's another mark on instant feedback.  No.  Kevin, what's going on?  Not much, guys.  Hey, I'm calling from Buffalo, and I just want to let you know, I started listening  right after about September 11th.  You guys are awesome.  Let me tell you something.  Well, Buffalo.  We love Buffalo.  We're doing very well in Buffalo.  Well, I'm glad somebody loves Buffalo.  We love Buffalo.  We love the program director there. 
[00:04:30]  He calls up on a regular basis.  We talk.  We discuss the show.  Very good.  On a very professional level.  He likes it, understands it, and takes an interest in it, unlike this person.  Don't let anybody give any crap.  It's a good show.  You're doing well.  When we have conference calls where all the program directors of the syndicated Opie and  Anthony show, they could call in and get together and exchange ideas and stuff, he's actually  involved in the call.  Buffalo calls up, unlike this other guy who was too busy walking around with his record  buddies. 
[00:05:00]  Hey, Cosmo from Jersey.  On instant feedback.  Thank you, Kevin.  All right.  You guys take care.  Bye-bye.  A lot of people getting it right.  Mm-hmm.  No problems with Buffalo.  They get it.  Very excited.  Alfred, what's up?  Hey, man.  Calling from New Orleans.  Hey, what's up?  New Orleans.  Well, giving you your day rating.  Show kicks, man.  Oh, you liked it?  Yeah.  You liked yesterday's show?  Yeah.  Well, this way, when we just bring it down to nothing, because we have nothing to talk  about.  Oh, geez. 
[00:05:30]  You're going to have to sit through those days.  No, to show kicks, it beats the jazz station that we did have in effect.  We're replacing a jazz station?  That's what you replaced.  A smooth jazz station.  Smooth?  A smooth jazz?  Yeah.  Yeah, whatever the hell that's supposed to be.  Yeah.  A kick.  Uh-huh.  You know, but it kicks.  It rocks.  It's going to be up there.  You're going to get a lot of good ratings from Dallas.  Let me tell you something.  And, Alfred, they're very motivated down there.  Yeah.  To have the opening up.  I like that.  Extremely.  Oh, yeah.  Well, we've been needing a good station for quite some time. 
[00:06:00]  I think somebody just had to pull it together and take the initial step.  All right.  And they're going in the right direction.  They're making good moves.  You know, I think that...  All right, Alfred.  Thank you.  Nice.  We get it.  Thank you.  Thanks, man.  Thanks for calling in, too.  All right?  There he is.  Well...  We've got to be nice to them.  Yeah, I know.  We can't just, like...  God forbid our ratings drop in the first month in New Orleans.  People are very curious.  Ernie from Jersey saying that...  Did we say Tim Sabian stands behind us? 
[00:06:30]  I don't know if I'd feel comfy having a guy in tight slacks standing behind us.  We mean it figuratively.  Because I would never want Tim Sabian standing too close behind me, actually.  You know what I mean?  I enjoy Tim Sabian and his slacks standing.  And his tight slacks.  A guy I talk to every day.  Every single day.  Tim Sabian.  And he screams and jumps up and down when I call him.  So excited.  He, a major cheerleader of the syndicated Opie and Anthony show.  Loves the show. 
[00:07:00]  Understands it.  Gets pissed off when Chicago doesn't show an interest.  You know what else with Tim?  He knew the second we were able to be on his station, we were on the station.  He wanted us.  He actually wanted us on the station.  We had to say...  He didn't have to bullcrap us after we were on and make believe he wanted us on the station.  It's not Kingston.  Kingston's a toll.  It's not even our...  Kingston's a program director in New York that has absolutely no ratings outside Morning Drive. 
[00:07:30]  He has nothing to do with our lives.  Don't worry about it.  Mike, what's going on?  Hey, what's happening, ONA?  Hey.  You guys rocked.  Call from Cleveland.  I want to know, how are the ratings?  Have you seen ratings from Cleveland?  Cleveland?  You guys have been on here, what, four or five months now?  The ratings in Cleveland are very strong, my friend.  Yes.  Very strong.  Tell me what.  And it's not Cleveland.  We love Cleveland.  It is not Cleveland.  Another city.  At first, Kim didn't really understand the show, in my opinion, and then she had to work 
[00:08:00]  out some kinks, but I do believe the show is running very smoothly in Cleveland now, and  we've got a huge ONA army out there.  A lot of buzz about the show, right, Anthony?  Yeah.  Jay Moore tells us every time he calls.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, absolutely.  He seems to play at a comedy club in Cleveland every other week.  Yeah.  We're loving Cleveland.  He likes it.  I can tell you're doing better, because when you first started, it was like they'd play  one commercial and, like, six songs, and then go rolling into your show.  And now, it's like they don't even time to squeeze in 15, 30 seconds of a song before 
[00:08:30]  you guys are back.  They're selling some commercials.  Oh, so they're selling the commercials.  Oh, absolutely.  Very good.  See?  You guys got to come out here, all right?  I bet you there's a lot of commercials to make your junk bigger, stronger, faster.  Faster.  Whatever you need.  Million dollar junk.  All right, man.  Thank you, Mike.  All right.  Take it easy, guys.  Bye.  It's so funny.  Everyone's calling in hoping it's not their city.  I know.  Julio.  Hey, what's up, O'Neill? 
[00:09:00]  You guys rock, man.  Hey.  I know what city it is.  Oh, oh.  You said they blow you off?  Yeah.  Is that San Francisco?  Oh, that's...  That would make sense, but no.  We love San Francisco.  Yep.  They're a little wacky, and they like their country music when we go to break, but so  far, so good.  They're motivated.  They did a wow parade, Anthony.  Yes.  They did a wow parade?  They did a wow parade.  They don't even have bumper stickers.  They had the gay signs up?  Well, they walked all over San Francisco with, like, wow banners and homemade wow bumper 
[00:09:30]  stickers, and they had camcorders, and...  Isn't that great?  And they got strippers.  Oh, strippers.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We love San Francisco.  Yes.  Nice.  Nicey-nice.  All right, Julio.  All right.  You guys rock.  Thank you.  People don't seem to be getting this.  Huh.  Well, they don't seem to be getting the right city.  Uncle John, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  I just want to congratulate the two Seinfelds of Radio, a number one show about nothing. 
[00:10:00]  Exactly.  Hey, let me take a guess.  Could it be Dallas?  Oh, Dallas.  Dallas.  You know, we've banged heads with Dallas, but let me see.  Oh, no.  It is not.  Let me tell you about Dallas.  Dallas.  They love the Opie and Anthony show in Dallas.  And there's some politics going on down there.  Ah.  A certain someone happened to get some good ratings just when they were thinking of moving  things around.  Oh.  Look at me throwing dirt today.  Well, I try.  It's not Dallas.  They're very motivated. 
[00:10:30]  They love having the show.  Unfortunately, it's on late at night, but if they could, they would switch that immediately.  Mm-hmm.  Or fix that immediately.  Good guess, though, Uncle John.  Yeah.  Thank you.  Good guess.  Let's go to Dave.  Dave, you're next on the Opie and Anthony show.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Is it that?  That's the only person I could think of, because that guy is the biggest slob.  No.  Sorry, guys.  No, and he's not our PD.  Oh, I thought he was the DC PD.  He could be whatever he wants, but he's not our PD. 
[00:11:00]  You're right.  You guys rule.  All right.  Thank you.  See ya.  No, it's not Washington.  No, it is not Washington.  Washington, very motivated to have the show, Anthony.  I think people are extremely motivated.  They got the WOW stickers.  They're doing all sorts of WOW sticker stops.  People don't understand this, because I believe it would shock them.  They probably can't imagine.  All right.  I'll tell you.  It's New York City.  It's New York City. 
[00:11:30]  Our own Jeremy Coleman?  No, it's not New York City.  Of course not.  Let's go to Keith the Cop.  Keith, what's going on?  Could it be the big wazoo?  The big wazoo?  The big wazoo?  No.  No.  I must say, we love being on in Columbus, Keith.  All right.  It's the wackiest station that the show is on, the big wazoo, but they seem motivated in Columbus to have us.  J-Bombs, Tom, Nicole, they're all coming in now. 
[00:12:00]  We love the big wazoo.  But it might lose the title of the wackiest station we're on.  Yeah.  Because we're now on a station called The Juice.  The Juice.  They're homeless, my friend.  I'll see what I can do.  Homeless Shopping Spree 2 happens Tuesday, less than a week away.  Peace.  The Juice.  O-J Radio.  The Juice.  I'm surprised we were able to, you know, organize Homeless Shopping Spree 2, Anthony, with all the lack of show prep that we do for our radio show. 
[00:12:30]  Isn't that amazing?  Look at us trying to do something.  Yeah.  We're actually going to try to do a bit for everybody.  Paul, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey, man.  We love it, Rochester.  Oh, oh, oh.  No, it is not.  We love Rochester.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  Started my little radio career at WCMF in Rochester.  Hey, Ernie. 
[00:13:00]  Ernie's got it.  Everyone is hoping it's not their city.  Scott, what's going on?  Hey, what's up?  Hey, yo.  Yeah, what's up?  Did I hear you correctly?  Tim Sabian is one of the show's biggest cheerleaders, and you talk to him every day.  Every day.  Do you enjoy his tight slacks?  I enjoy his, sure.  I enjoy him and his tight slacks.  What, do you want to make out with him or something?  No, I don't. 
[00:13:30]  Thank you.  Thank you, Scott.  Peace.  Noah.  Elkie.  Everyone's getting it on instant feedback.  Joe, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  It's the vengeful Gary Wall from the grave that is his career.  All right.  Joe rules.  Gary Wall, for everyone that is listening that doesn't get it, was the program director that  brought us to New York.  Yeah.  And he's now, I hear he's doing like a talk show in the middle of nowhere.  Yeah.  Great. 
[00:14:00]  All right.  Todd.  Thank you.  Brother Joe.  Yes.  What's up?  Without giving it away, because I have a funny feeling I know exactly who it is.  Is his first name Ed?  Let's start.  Oh, yeah.  Ed.  Ed.  Ed.  Ed I.  Let me think.  Eddie I.  Let me think.  Let me think.  See that?  I knew it. 
[00:14:30]  Why does it take Brother Joe to get the answer?  I don't know.  Yes, it is indeed.  The fact.  WBCN Boston.  The fact is WBCN in Boston, very, very panicked about the Opie and Anthony show.  Freaking out a little bit.  Relax.  And not everybody there.  I know it right away.  As soon as you said it was a musical tool.  A lot of the people that work at BCN love this show, work hard for it, very supportive.  But it seems the program director, he's having a little bit of a problem with the show. 
[00:15:00]  And he's whining to all the other PDs that carry this program.  I don't know that for sure.  That's what I'm hearing.  I know he's whining.  It's him Sabian.  He's talking to Jeremy.  I know he's whining to our bosses, wondering if you and I do show prep or if we just wing it.  Well, how about, uh, don't worry about it.  Thank you, Brother Joe.  No problem.  Yeah, they're all freaked out.  Ratings were fine the first two months that we were on in Boston. 
[00:15:30]  The third month was a disaster.  And now they think it's over.  Oh, already.  Even though the ratings for the entire station was a disaster.  But for some reason, that's our fault, right?  Yeah, okay.  Ah, Jesus Christ.  All right, Ant.  There it is.  There you go.  Jesus Christ.  Can we have a PD up in Massachusetts that we actually get along with?  Oh, that wouldn't be smart. 
[00:16:00]  Oh, we got along with Ron Valeri.  Yes, we did.  We like the Ron Valeri.  You're right there.  Another guy that was used by WAF.  Hmm.  All right, let's take a break, Anthony, okay?  All right.  It's the O&A show.  Even though we didn't really prepare today, I don't know, we're going to pull some things  out of our butt.  All right.  We're going to talk about what the hell is that.  It's coming up Friday.  Sandy Kane is confirmed.  So Friday on the O&A show, we finally find out what TWATO is.  And other people coming down to get diagnosed as well. 
[00:16:30]  Yeah.  Matter of fact, if you want to be part of what the hell is that, give us a call, okay?  Also, homeless shopping spree right around the corner.  We'll discuss that a little further today.  We're helping for the holidays.  And, yeah, that's pretty much all we really prepared today.  That's it?  No, of course not.  Jay Moore coming in today, Anthony.  Yeah.  U.S. Olympic hockey gold medalist Jim Craig stopping by at 430.  Remember the pride in this country when they beat those Rooshkies?  The goalie who wore the American flag at the end there?  You guys know.  That's great. 
[00:17:00]  Greatest game ever played.  Kick the commies' ass.  I like that.  You tell me a game that was greater than that one.  Hmm.  It's not going to happen.  Earl's still in the hospital.  We're going to check in with Earl today, right?  Yankees beating the Mets in the World Series.  That was good.  No.  That was a good game.  Good game.  Slow roller up the baseline.  Oh, my God.  Threw his legs.  No.  That was a good game.  For you, maybe.  Actually, it was a good game for me. 
[00:17:30]  All right.  Why don't we take a break?  All right.  In the New York.  Oh, we're not supposed to say, why don't we take a break?  Because then that means that, you know, and then we're playing commercials and that gives  people a chance to, like, go somewhere else.  Oh, is that it?  Is that what you've heard?  Yeah, that was told to me as well.  Oh.  So you should never say, you know, we're going to take a break now.  So how do you get into a commercial break?  You just kind of hit the commercials and then hope that people are stupid enough to think  it's part of the show and to think that we're still doing a show. 
[00:18:00]  Did the research show that?  These people are going to drive me effing nuts.  I swear to God.  People know when you hit commercials.  So if you say, we're going to take a break and we'll be back with this after that, they get  it.  Just hit it.  Now back to Opie and Anthony on 96.5 WCMF, Rochester, New York.  Guess what you did, sir?  Pile them for the one, sir. 
[00:18:30]  You're going to guess what you did, sir?  Pucker up and kiss my ass!  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah.  Boy, I sure hope they're listening in Boston this afternoon, Anthony.  On your knees.  Are you going to kiss my ass or not?  You think they're listening in Boston today?  Yeah.  Oh, I hope they are.  Golly gee. 
[00:19:00]  Adam Farrar in the studio.  Yeah, look who wheeled in.  Hiya, pal.  Hey, Dan.  We didn't even know that you were coming by today.  Sure?  Yeah.  Well, we don't show prep.  We're like, take care of our own show.  So, how would we know?  Oh, wait a minute.  I must have walked in on the middle of something.  How would we know, right, Anthony?  Yeah.  We wouldn't know.  Yeah, if people just pop on by.  We don't plan on it or anything.  A PD up there in Boston.  I know I'm a tool and I get cranky for stupid things, but when that man right there is cranky  with me, I'm like, okay, I know I'm in the right area. 
[00:19:30]  Okay.  It's that a PD up there in Boston.  He's being it.  Giving you crap?  No, not even giving us crap.  He's like, oh, yeah, always love to have you here.  It's great.  Thank God you're here.  This is going to be great.  O&A afternoons.  Right.  Gee, I only try to put it off for three effing years.  And then we're finally up there.  Right.  We did well the first two months in the ratings.  Really well.  Good.  And then, oh, I don't know.  Gee, I wonder what happened that last month.  Could it have been a national catastrophe?  Wait a minute.  He's giving you crap because? 
[00:20:00]  Yeah, yeah, because for some reason we didn't have as many listeners.  Well, ratings are down.  Ratings are down.  Because the people in Boston, they don't find us funny and they don't really remember us  from the old days, so we're just effed.  Okay.  We're just effed.  Sorry.  We're just biding our time.  I'm taking my plugs and I'm getting out of here.  I won't even do this.  Right.  We're just biding our time and then, you know.  It'll be back.  Eventually, they'll kick us off the air and they can go back to playing their cute little songs.  The best damn radio show.  You know, obviously, the Boston listeners were a little more concerned with seeing how 
[00:20:30]  their lax security resulted up there in Boston.  We should worry about radio.  I'm really going to play.  Okay.  Right in.  We have to tune this in.  Oh, you forgot your box cutter.  If they're going to take up four hours of time on my station, they better get ratings.  That's what he said.  Oh, I forgot that one.  Ruling with his iron fist.  They better get ratings.  Now, who is that?  I'm giving up four hours on my station.  He's giving up four hours.  Who's the Moolah program director?  We're going to give up, Anthony.  What?  Who's the Moolah program director?  Oedipus.  Oedipus? 
[00:21:00]  Yeah.  Anyway.  He's got his own issues.  And you know what?  This wouldn't bother us as much, but our own Ken Stevens decides to tell me at lunch  about ten minutes before we get on the radio.  That's never good.  Oh, that's horrible.  That's never good.  Doctor, before you go into surgery, there's something you should know.  Right.  Oh, what else did he say?  Yeah.  They better get ratings or they're going to be playing music.  Yeah.  He's going to, like, if we don't get ratings that are up to his snuff, there's going to 
[00:21:30]  be music on our show?  No.  Hello?  What?  What?  No.  Don't think so.  How long has he been the program director?  Forever.  Forever.  Forever and ever.  What happened, Ben?  What?  Psycho Marcus.  Nothing.  He would love to chime in.  No love lost there, that's for sure.  Big Chocolate, what's up?  Yeah, what's up, cousin?  How y'all doing?  Oh, Christ.  Cracking the town or what?  Unfunny piece of crap on the phone? 
[00:22:00]  That's right, man.  Hey, listen, I'll hook y'all up.  I'll go up to Boston and pee on this guy's car for you.  Oh.  Would that work?  Wow, that's great.  That's great stuff there, Big Chocolate.  Then I'll go pee on his front door.  Big Chocolate, shut up.  Hey, hey.  Why are you even calling?  Take it easy, you ravioli-eating bastard.  Awful.  Watch your mouth.  Oh, stop it.  Play one of my hit songs, dammit.  What are your...  You don't have any hit songs.  I'm going to turn into Vinny to get in here or what?  You have nothing.  You're awful.  I'm going to smack in your big forehead.  Relax. 
[00:22:30]  Is there a reason you're calling today, Big Chocolate?  Because I want...  What a...  What a...  Ah.  See, we've got to deal with some of that on a daily basis.  That's the program director in Boston calling me.  Yeah, that was him right there.  All right.  Finley, you're next on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  What's up?  I'm surprised you guys haven't gone to commercial yet.  What do you mean?  I haven't heard any commercials yet.  It's been like, you know, almost an hour.  We fooled him.  You guys haven't gone to commercial.  We fooled him, O.P.  Did we fool you?  So maybe that program director is correct.  Well, usually, like you guys say, well, all right, we're going to be right back, you 
[00:23:00]  know, with Adam Ferrara.  You know, but you didn't say that, so...  Okay.  Boston is dumping out of all the bad ass you're saying.  Oh, are they?  Are they now?  They're dumping out of your show like crazy.  Not sure if it's delay in New York or Boston.  What gives?  Ah, there we go.  Hey, we got him.  We got him.  He's wounded.  Let's get him.  They're dumping out in Boston.  All right.  Okay.  That's how it goes. 
[00:23:30]  Another station that can't handle the truth.  What, did we hurt your feelings?  Did we hurt your little feelings?  Just speaking the truth.  People just don't like hearing the truth.  No, no.  Gee, what are they going to do if they run out of delay?  How are they dumping out?  I didn't think we had delay over there.  Sometimes the truth just hurts, doesn't it?  We don't have much.  They're going to go to music?  How long is the delay?  I don't know.  I don't know over there.  We should say something about Boston every 11 seconds. 
[00:24:00]  So every time they come back, it's going to be a fact.  Dave, you're next on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  What's up?  Yeah, I just wanted to find out what you guys would do when you went to commercials, and  I switched over to Light FM.  Oh, you did?  And I just wanted to find out what was going on.  Did I miss anything?  But you weren't supposed to know that we were going to commercials.  We were supposed to, you know, trick you.  Oh, geez.  I feel bad now.  All right.  Thank you, Dave.  All right, man.  All right.  Yeah.  Are they really dumping out like crazy?  That's what I hear.  That's what I hear.  On instant feedback, that's what they're saying. 
[00:24:30]  Oh, well.  What can you do?  Well, we got to them.  There you go.  Whose decision is that?  Because the program director's not even there today?  No, he's not even there today.  I don't know.  We'll find out, I'm sure.  I'm sure we'll be dragged into some dull meeting about this.  No, I ain't going into a meeting for this one.  We'll let Super GM Ken Stevens take care of this one.  Send big chocolate in.  Huh?  Send big chocolate in.  That's not a bad idea.  I want to find out about... 
[00:25:00]  Screw that.  Let's find out about Adam now.  Adam.  What happened about Adam?  I want to find out why your program is not on.  We come back in January.  You come back with the job?  In January, yes.  Dennis Leary and the job, my pal Adam Ferrara, is on that show.  And we'll be back in January.  Now, why weren't you on before that?  Apparently, the ratings in Boston were a little soft.  So we wanted to firm up that market before we came back.  I heard they slipped another show in under your feet there. 
[00:25:30]  Yeah, they put in Bob Patterson.  They put in Bob Patterson?  Yeah, they put that in there to burn that off.  Oh, my God.  I thought our lives sucked.  Can you believe that?  There's a show like The Job.  Let me tell you something.  The Job is a great show.  You got bumped for Bob Patterson?  The ratings were different, so they burned it off, and they're going to bring us back in January.  How many episodes of The Job aired?  We aired six.  You aired six.  It had a huge buzz.  Yep. 
[00:26:00]  Very funny show.  Mm-hmm.  And, in my opinion, should have been put right on the air.  Cool.  And you had your episodes all in the can.  All done.  And who told you, look, it's not going to start now.  It's going to start in January.  We've got to put Bob Patterson on.  Well, no, they wanted to.  And, again, like, I run the network.  Right.  You're looking at me like I'm the program director.  I will not have this done.  If I'm going to give up my airtime, they better get ratings. 
[00:26:30]  We're going to sell some Nabisco crackers, damn it.  So, no, they pushed us back to January because of reasons.  I don't know.  They said you're on in January.  That's because you get a guy.  They want to.  You know, Bob Patterson has to.  And he's gone now.  Yeah.  Wow.  Look, Anthony, if we ran the world, everything would be different.  Absolutely.  It would be great.  Paintball guns for everyone.  Shooting each other.  Paintball guns.  And water filtration systems on everyone's faucet. 
[00:27:00]  You've got to go back for that one.  Now, Adam, you came walking in here, and you were talking about calling Anthony at home.  You don't do that.  You've had that experience when he's on the computer game.  Yeah.  It's all over.  It's like Captain Pike.  He just communicates with those little lights.  I give a grunt.  Oh, wait a minute.  Sorry.  Never put the name on the S.  Never put the name on the S?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  All right.  All right.  The significant other.  Can I say that?  Right.  All right.  So, the program director in Boston answers the phone because they're living together now. 
[00:27:30]  Very...  Oh, my God.  Very...  But, you know, when he's playing that computer game, it's all over.  I can't be distracted.  No, it's just grunting and shooting and cursing.  It's my primary goal.  Ant, your head's on fire.  Eh?  Eh?  What game were you playing in there?  Okay.  Because I think at one point you thought I called you an effing Nazi.  Yeah.  What the hell was that? 
[00:28:00]  I was playing Castle Wolfenstein.  And this game kicks ass.  I mean, swastikas in a video game.  Right.  I mean, SS officers.  Go stepping their way across your monitor.  And you get to kill them.  Right.  It's great.  And then you check behind pictures of Hitler for hitting booty.  Really?  Hitting loot.  Oh, it's a great game.  Who are you in the game?  I'm like an agent guy.  Right.  I got to go in to various Nazi locations, kill as many of the Nazis as I can, and screw up their plans for world domination, Adam. 
[00:28:30]  And you called?  How dare.  In the middle of that?  How dare me call it?  It is a cool game.  You got to check this out.  The graphics, fantastic.  I can't play.  Great storyline.  And the weapons, they give you three.  So far, I got three different kinds of sniper rifles that I'm just...  He loves the sniper rifles.  You hit them in the head, their little Nazi helmets go flying off their head.  It's fantastic.  I'm going to leave them.  I highly recommend that.  A little spray of blood goes...  Yeah.  Get the blood. 
[00:29:00]  The artificial intelligence on the Nazis.  Very good.  You can't just run away from them.  They'll chase you.  You got to shoot them.  And sometimes you got to creep around and stab them.  No, but I was in a segment of the game last night, and I'm playing.  I thought I was cool.  I thought I cleared out a whole area.  I hear a plane flying above.  I go outside.  I look up.  There's parachutes coming down.  German paratroopers just all over the place.  Great game if you're looking for another first-person shooter.  Right.  Yeah, and people are probably wondering why I got off of EverQuest to do that, because 
[00:29:30]  they released a new version of EverQuest that is really, really buggy, and I haven't  been able to play for two days.  So you had to move on to another game.  I had to move on to another game.  Adam, do you play the video games?  The computer games?  I'm spending my time reading, so I'm an idiot.  Reading?  Reading is so overrated.  That's what those, what do they call them?  Books.  Those book things.  I bought that one game you told me about, Hitman.  Yeah, I kind of liked it.  It was third-person, but not bad.  I only got a laptop. 
[00:30:00]  I don't have a desktop computer.  Adam is hysterical with this.  The first laptop ever bought was bought by Adam, and I think it had a steam engine in  it and a little pressure relief thing, and he comes over to my house with this laptop.  How big was the laptop?  It was huge.  It was huge.  Like a desktop Samsonite thing.  It was huge.  So he comes over with that, and this game, this fighter, some kind of fighter game, F-18 
[00:30:30]  or something.  This is going back.  1990?  I don't know.  Something like that.  And he comes over, he hands me the laptop and the game, and he goes, here, make it work.  Yeah, I couldn't figure it out.  I loaded up, he had a monochrome monitor on it.  So it wasn't even color.  We couldn't get this game to work.  It sucked.  And he's been inept with computers ever since.  Yeah, I can't figure it out.  He doesn't play games.  He doesn't know about video cards to get better graphics.  He's a sad sort when it comes to the games. 
[00:31:00]  You'd enjoy him.  It's a great way to spend the part of your life that you should be doing other things in.  Yeah, you're actually busy in your life?  Nah, not me.  Are you crazy?  Yeah.  I wanted to get one for Christmas, but what can I get that I can play on the laptop?  Because I don't have enough.  Laptop?  Laptop, you just need a lot of memories.  Is it a newer laptop?  Yeah, it's that new compact.  You look like an Xbox type of guy.  Really?  You look like an Xbox.  You look like a console guy because he doesn't have a desktop.  You know you could play on a laptop that isn't that bad?  Age of Empires.  Get that one. 
[00:31:30]  What's that?  You'll like that.  It's a little game where you build stuff and you kill people.  I think you're more of a SimCity type guy.  The Sims?  Yeah, the Sims.  You're not going to get the good graphic killing on a laptop, though.  Right.  You know?  I like...  I need...  First of all, I get a monitor that is, like, bigger than my TV.  Yeah.  I need huge...  I need enough of a machine where I can push all the options for graphics up to full  and not have any slowdown in the graphics, and then I'll sit there. 
[00:32:00]  I don't care what you're talking about.  Just nod.  Don't excite me.  He's like...  You saw it in his face.  Yeah.  Just nod when he talks.  You're like...  Get him on to the Sims, Anthony.  You eat, you sleep, you go to work.  It's something simple.  I mean, you're changing stuff.  The Sims, you eat, you sleep, you go to work.  Hopefully, you bang the neighbor.  He'd pull up to my house with his car and be like, it's broke.  He's like, what's the matter with it, Adam?  I don't know.  It's broke.  Broke.  You've got to fix it.  It's broke.  I go, well, pop the hood.  Don't know how.  It's like, well... 
[00:32:30]  Probably a lever over there by the...  You know, he's letting go of the emergency brake thing.  The trunk goes up.  We finally open it up, and after, like, probing the engine and whatnot, it turns out Adam's  out of gas.  Nah.  The guy doesn't...  Moron.  All right.  Dan wants in.  Dan, what's up?  How you doing, guys?  Hey.  All right.  What's up, man?  I just wanted to find out about that return to Castle Wolfenstein game.  It is great.  Yeah.  It's the first first-person shooter I've played in a while that I think is great. 
[00:33:00]  Cool.  A lot of fun.  It looks good.  It plays really good.  Hey, you over here at SWAT?  SWAT 3?  Yeah.  I don't like having other people on the screen that I'm responsible for.  Oh, Christ.  All right.  That's why I don't like those other things where you're a member of a squad.  Yeah, yeah.  That's what I'm playing now.  It just wind up getting me in trouble.  I play first-person shooters, and sometimes they add in, like, all right, your mission  in this segment is to take this stupid scientist and make sure he doesn't get shot as you go  through this level. 
[00:33:30]  And I'm fine.  I can take care of business.  But I've got to protect this guy.  He's always running behind me, and some guy comes out and blows his head off.  And you've got to start at the beginning again.  See?  I can't be bothered.  I just like me going through these levels, shooting, killing things.  A lot of blood.  I don't like when they turn the gore off.  I need body parts and organs on the floor when I'm done.  You playing that game online, then?  Wolfenstein?  Not yet.  Still getting through the one person.  All right, Dan.  He gives it a great review.  Two thumbs up. 
[00:34:00]  Maybe I'll see you down the line playing Wolfenstein.  All right.  Hey, while we're talking about games, we've got to thank Rockstar Games for Grand Theft Auto  3.  Grand Theft Auto 3.  We are so happy that came in today.  This is great.  And I cannot wait to go home and play that.  Yeah, because I'm playing Silent Hill 2.  I'm just about done.  Yeah.  The game blew.  Yeah.  I heard that was a bad game.  Grand Theft Auto 3.  Adam?  Okay, go ahead.  You're driving around.  You've got to steal cars.  You've got various mayhem around the city.  You did that.  I know.  And then...  What you did... 
[00:34:30]  Get this.  If your health is going down, you pick up a hooker.  And you pay the hooker.  Corrupt cops.  You bang her in the car.  Right.  Your car starts rocking and your health goes up.  I knew they had the power to heal.  Right.  And then when you're done, you pay their money, right?  Right.  You want their money back, don't you?  Right.  You club her with a baseball bat and take the money back.  It's a great game.  Ideal Christmas present for the children.  She's just a hooker.  The game's getting rave reviews.  Wow.  Can't wait to check it out.  Yeah.  That's Auto Theft? 
[00:35:00]  What's that called?  Grand Theft Auto.  Look at this guy, Ryan.  Adam still has Commodore 64.  No, I haven't.  It came out with a 64?  Yeah.  I have Atari.  Atari.  Eddie, what's up?  Hey, guys.  What's up?  What's going on, man?  Hey.  From New Orleans.  It's been a while since I heard y'all.  Last time I heard y'all live was like y'all were doing mornings in a Boston station.  Mornings?  We've never done mornings.  No, it was...  I think...  Well, I'm not going to even say it, but y'all were calling up Tina Marie?  It must have been afternoons, wasn't it?  Oh, wait, wait.  Tina... 
[00:35:30]  Yeah, you remember when you called up Tina.  Tina Louise.  Yeah, Tina Louise.  Oh, God.  Oh, yeah.  Ginger.  Yeah, Ginger.  We only had one question after, right?  Yeah, we used to have her home number, and we used to mess with her bad.  Oh, let me tell you.  These guys, I actually taped it and played it for some friends around the country.  And I'm like, who's these guys?  Whoopi and Anthony, come on.  Yeah, we're a couple guys that don't really show prep.  We're just kind of wing it.  It seems to work for us, yeah.  Go figure.  It seems to work.  New Orleans loves y'all, man.  All right.  Thank you, Eddie. 
[00:36:00]  Thanks, man.  We just started down there, so give us a little time.  No, I'm telling you, they'll love you.  There's nothing on right now.  Come on.  Cool.  Thank you.  Bye, guys.  Bye.  I don't know.  What?  I was just looking at what Keith has.  Keith the cop.  Tippi Tom.  Who's Tippi Tom?  Because we're doing a homeless shopping spree.  Oh, Keith the cop.  Hi, my name's Tommy.  Tommy.  Tippi Tom, yeah.  What's up, Tippi Tom?  My name's Tommy.  Somebody invited me to go up. 
[00:36:30]  Oh, yeah.  This is going to be the greatest homeless shopping spree ever.  Hey, Tippi Tom.  Tippi Tom.  Yeah, Tippi Tom's going to show up.  Tippi Tom, you...  Between one and two, the rest I just...  This is great.  Tippi Tom, you're going on our homeless shopping spree.  We're going to give you some money, and you're going to go shopping.  Yeah.  What are you going to buy?  I don't know.  What do you need there, Tippi Tom? 
[00:37:00]  Oh, I don't know.  Maybe a pair of shoes, a pair of pants, something.  How long have you been on the street, Tom?  Huh?  How long have you been on the street?  Since 16.  Since 16.  And how old a man are you now?  Well, I look like I'm 20, but I'm 49.  Something tells me.  Yeah, that's probably reversed.  He tried to mess here, but I missed out.  But I'm going to try to give it a go, because I've got a few guys getting together.  They're guys, you know. 
[00:37:30]  And because I hang out here all the time.  Yeah.  They take over the night.  And so what I'm going to do is, he said to meet him on the 11th, on the corner of the year.  Ah, this is great.  Meet him on the 11th, on the corner, right?  What's your name, sweetheart?  What are you calling, sweetheart?  What are you calling, sweetheart?  I've got to have your name, so I know who I'm talking to when I get there.  Oh, my God.  You're not a gay homeless guy, are you there, tippy-ton?  My name is Rick.  Huh?  My name's Rick.  Yep. 
[00:38:00]  They call me Mad Max.  Right.  It's the Rick and Mad Max show.  Mad Max.  I got muscles.  I worked out every day.  Yeah, me too.  I used to be, well, I'm in good shape.  Yeah.  I'm not 49.  I'm 45 years old.  Ah, well, that's, all right.  See, I thought so.  But my birthday's coming up on the 8th.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, I'll be 46.  Well, happy birthday to you.  Yeah, 45 plus one would be 46.  Happy birthday to you.  So, tippy-ton, you're going to need new shoes? 
[00:38:30]  I'll be 46.  Is that what you said?  You're going to need new shoes?  No, no.  In December.  This is going to be fantastic.  This is the fastest shopping spree ever.  It's going to be fantastic.  See, when we don't listen to people, we do good radio.  The first almost shopping spree was good, but we had to get some of the guys from shelters.  Guys that really wanted to get back on their feet.  No, we want guys like tippy-ton. 
[00:39:00]  I don't believe you.  I don't have any of my own business.  I have business.  We're free of them.  Oh, yeah?  Oh, yeah?  I'm doing everything up.  Dealing drugs.  I know I'm kind of like down and down.  Are you a dot-commer?  Huh?  Hey, tippy-ton.  I'm a dot-commer.  Tip, tippy-ton, tippy-ton.  If you were on the street since you were 16, how did you have three businesses?  Well, I like, well, you want the truth?  Yes.  Well, I came to New York when I was 16 because my parents kicked me out of the house because 
[00:39:30]  I quit school.  Uh-huh.  Right.  And I got kicked out.  So I was in hell with it.  I hitchhiked up to New York City.  Right.  That's the best thing to do when you're a teen in a way.  And I used to hustle.  Oh, you used to hustle?  Were you, uh...  Did you get men that would use you or your body?  Hmm?  Oh, no, no, no. 
[00:40:00]  Hustling is male prostitution, Opie.  But, you know, I, you know...  Hey, tippy, you swallowed some ropes there or what?  I had a girlfriend, yeah.  I had one.  Okay.  What was his name?  I had more boyfriend than both of you.  Oh, there you go.  Tippy Tom, we got...  He's a gay homeless guy.  Tippy Tom.  God, is this going to rock Tuesday?  Tippy Tom.  Wow.  God bless you, Tippy Tom.  Hey, by the way, I love you in Scarface. 
[00:40:30]  Huh?  I love you in Scarface.  Sounds like...  He does sound like...  We're looking forward to this.  Oh, tippy Tom, we're looking forward to it more than you.  Tippy Tom, repeat it after us, okay?  See?  He said December 11th.  No.  He said December 10th.  I was trying to show up on a radio show.  But he also said December 11th is coming to meet you at.  The three of the things more disgusting, his toenails are stalker paddies.  He's been around here by five years. 
[00:41:00]  Well, we sure can compare the two.  Wow.  Tippy Tom.  Hi.  My name is Rick.  Hey.  My name is Mad Max.  What?  And I'm Rick.  Rick?  We're muscular.  Are you still hustling?  Well, I'm trying to get back on the horse trail, but I don't look as good as I used to.  Tippy Tom, how much for you to suck it?  I got trying to.  I'm not a man.  How much to suck it, Tippy Tom?  Yeah, what does a hummer from a homeless guy go for these days? 
[00:41:30]  This was years ago, you got to remember.  How much?  How much to suck it?  What?  How much would it cost for you to suck it?  How much would it cost what?  For you to suck it.  I was having a hard time hearing.  Well, maybe we'll get this answer when he comes in live.  How much would it cost for what?  You know, for some oral treats.  For you to suck on it.  Huh? 
[00:42:00]  This is going to be such a great holiday moment.  Tippy Tom.  All right, Tippy.  I can't wait to meet you.  I promise I'll be sober at Iowa.  No, no.  No, no.  No, no.  Tippy Tom, it's over for us.  It's the Christmas.  I'm going to have a couple of beers.  All right, very good.  Just a couple.  Just a couple.  It's the Christmas spirit.  Just to get you loose.  All right.  All right, Tippy Tom.  I'm going to show up.  I promise.  I really want to do this.

Yeah, he's back in his car.  He's too far away right now.

[00:48:00]  One more thing  Gay homeless guy, always fun  Always funny  Yes  All right, thank you, Dave  Tippy Tom  Gay homeless guy  Gay homeless guy singing  Always fun  You want to hear Jingle Bell?  Rudolph  Rudolph  It's not going to get funnier than that  Jingle Bell?  Look, man  It ain't getting funnier than that  That's  Why don't you go and tune in to another station  Yeah  You don't get that kind of humor if you prepare  That's right  All right  Uh, Anthony 
[00:48:30]  Yeah  We're going to go to a clip from the last time we did a homeless shopping spree  Two years ago now  Two years ago  My God  I believe this is the bus on the way to the mall  With all the homeless guys singing some Christmas carols  This is great  Somebody's actually suggesting that we should get all the homeless guys  To sing individual Christmas songs  And then get them all together to sing one Christmas carol  And put that out on a CD  Homeless Christmas  Oh my God  Give some proceeds to the homeless  I mean, it would be great 
[00:49:00]  That's a great idea  Yeah  That is a great idea  Thank you, Jason  But we won't do anything with that idea  Because we don't really  Right  We're going to work too hard on our radio show  Back to the video game  That's right  Anthony, here they are  The homeless guys on the bus singing Jingle Bells  One, two, three, go  Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells  Jingle Bells  Hey, hey 
[00:49:30]  Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells  You hear Craval  I hear Craval's flute  Alright, good job guys  The only thing that would make that better  Is the sound of that bus crashing into an abutment  Did you hear that?  Hey, be the night  Be the night  Oh, okay  You're right  It is the holiday season  Yes  That was fantastic, wasn't it? 
[00:50:00]  And we will outdo ourselves this year  Yeah, yeah, man  They're all intoxicated  By the way  You should dress them up  By the way  Why don't we tell the people this much  If you're within 40 minutes of Manhattan  That's all we're going to say  Right  Just draw a circle  If you could get  40 minute drive  From midtown Manhattan  To anywhere  We could be going east  We could be going west  Right  We could be going north or south  Plenty of malls  You've got to take the day off  Because what makes the homeless shopping spree so special  Yeah  Is all our listeners following them around as they spend their money 
[00:50:30]  Yeah  Taking pictures  Also, a lot of our listeners get involved with the show  They call up  Give us their holiday observations  Of the homeless shopping spree  It's such a touching  They also tell us  Who's not into the holiday spirit  Yeah, which stores aren't  Some of our ballsy listeners  Go up to the store owners  With the cell phone  It's your chance to get involved with the show  And ask them  Hey, why didn't you let them in?  Why are you closing your store in the middle of the day?  Yeah, so  Like I said  They pull down the metal grates  Oh, they pull down the riot grates 
[00:51:00]  It's amazing  It's so nice that  You know, it makes me feel better that we're doing something  Do you have this in a large?  We had a homeless guy  We had Ziggy trying on really nice suits  At Versace  $2,000 suits  Smelling like urine  And he's in there  And the guy is like  Measuring his crusty inseam  It's wonderful  It's a great, great time  Hey, we need to keep the cop to call us  Because we need to know more about Tippi Tom  Tippi Tom  Sounds like that guy's got a story 
[00:51:30]  He hustled up  He has three businesses  Yeah  Anthony, we're going to be back  Mouth, back door  And what was the other one?  Follow the queen  Find the queen  We're going to be back after this  All right  You're not supposed to see it  Oh, yeah  We don't need Ben or Stinky 
[00:52:00]  We're the interns  Or Rick  Because Dan and I just winging it  We come flying in here about 3 o'clock on the nose  Fly into the seats  Throw the headphones on  And hey, we're doing a radio show  Doing a radio show 
[00:52:30]  Yeah  For 17 cities  And no one is on to us yet  We just wing it  Well, no  One genius in the broadcasting industry  Is finally on to us, Opie  And I don't know what to do about it  He's going to blow our gig  Yeah  We had been doing this for  Eight years almost  Almost eight years now  Winging it  No one the wiser  None of these other dopey PDs knew it  Couldn't pick up on it  Throw them all  Yeah, but Oedipus  My God 
[00:53:00]  He figured it out  He figured it out, Opie  And now what are we going to have to do?  I do believe this will be the last time  We win any sort of a war  Because they're now on to us  Or get ratings  Or anything  Because now he's going to spread the word  We were just named  Best afternoon drive show in America yesterday  But that's not going to happen anymore  Because everyone's going to be on to us  Then I can ask for the award back  Are they, Anthony?  I hope not  Then I can ask for the plot back  You know what he's like?  They're lip syncing the whole thing 
[00:53:30]  You guys are like the Milli Vanilli  Milli and Vanilli  Shut up  They don't even know that part of it  You idiot  When you see us out and about  That's just two guys we make believe are  Opie and Anthony  Pay no attention to the radio show  Behind the curtain  We're the voices behind the faces  Oedipus is like  We're actually two huge fat guys  Did you watch that episode of Star Trek?  Yeah  Where Kirk was Kirok  The god  They thought he was a god  And he had amnesia 
[00:54:00]  And then the one guy  They were all praising Kirok  And then one guy  Figured it out  That he was no god  And then he did something to him  Threw some rocks at him  And he started bleeding  He goes  Behold the god who bleeds  The jig was up  That guy is just like Oedipus  And he was beamed to Boston  To run radio  Exactly  He's on to us  And now what do we do, Opie?  I don't know  My god, the emperor has no clothes  Mike, what's going on?  Yeah, I'm calling to ask Opie 
[00:54:30]  What happened to his arms last night  Were they just winging it?  Hey, what happened, Opie?  I ran out of here  I had nothing to do with the loss  It took me an hour and a half  To get to the Coliseum  I missed basically half the game  Yeah  And by the time I was done  Being pissed off at myself  For being stuck in traffic  The game was over  You wound up getting box seats  Yes, the Flyers  You know what?  I gotta tell you  The Flyers played a great game yesterday  And the Islanders looked a little sluggish  We'll get you next time  Yeah, I could  The only thing that kept you 
[00:55:00]  You got box seats  You got pretty good seats  You got like packaged  Yeah  I sit next to Joey  You got 21 home games  Yeah  I know, it's not worth it  No, no  You get about half of each game  Out of the 21 games  I'll probably make it to  If I'm lucky  10  Yeah  I've already given away  Three, four games  And you'll only see  Not by choice  Because we're busy  Doing other things  Give me that crap  You don't prep for this  You'll see 15 periods of play 
[00:55:30]  That's about it, right?  Well  I definitely miss the first period always  Yeah  There's no way I could get to the Coliseum  Before the end of the season  Well, you know what?  You know what I wish would happen?  I wish the Jets would suck in the first quarter  So I can turn it off  And get stuff done  Yeah  They just go right to the end  And then blow up  Big Jets fan  Oh, God  It's December  What's that ticking?  It's Vinny Testaverde  It's killing you, right?  Yeah  I'm dying over here  All right, Pats  I'll give it to you  We're on in Boston  You guys got us 
[00:56:00]  See, the Pats prepare for a game  Yeah  They go to practice  Yeah  Like you're supposed to  Pats have a coach that understands  Yeah  They look  The Jets look good for three quarters  And then  All right  Now we're going to play backwards  They had nothing  They had nothing on that last drive  Come on, Vinny  All right, Anthony  Where are we going next?  Oh, Chris has a problem  With our homeless shopping spree  Let's look at this  What seems to be the problem?  Krista, what's going on?  Hi, I'd just like to know  Do you have any homeless women  That are going to be on the shopping spree? 
[00:56:30]  We would love to invite some homeless women  Along on this homeless shopping spree  We brought back a homeless woman  From New Jersey last time we did this  Didn't she hook up with Sitting Bull  Or whatever his name is?  Gray Wolf  Gray Wolf  Yeah, one of the homeless guys hooked up  And we gained a homeless guy  A girl  A homeless person, girl, right?  Came back with the homeless bus  Oh, I didn't know that  We would love  There's a crackhead that wears black  Oh, by the way, people  Don't forget my Tell Me extension 46743  Your what? 
[00:57:00]  Remember I called a few weeks ago  About the Tell Me phone site?  No  I created a Tell Me phone site  With your bit of the week on it  Thank you, Krista  Oh, my God  Wow, that rapid deceleration in the show  Thank God I was strapped in  Or I would have fallen right into the wall over there  Oh, my God  It's too bad we weren't prepared for that  We would have been able to go to something  In case this happens, punch out 
[00:57:30]  Yeah, in case this happens  Play old bit here  Or something, you know  We would, answering a question  Any homeless women, we would love  There's one in the corner  That has the little cardboard box  It's like the little short ones  That the cases of soda come in  She's fake homeless  Is she fake homeless?  Fake homeless  How do you know?  You can just tell  She looks a little too clean to be homeless  Well, maybe she's new  Like she showers and stuff  Yeah?  Or she sleeps next to a hydrant  She's a lovely lady, though 
[00:58:00]  I throw my change down  She's got a spot  She's always there  57th and Broadway there  Yeah, right by Dwayne Reed  Yeah, sure  I used to throw her cigarettes when I was smoking  I would come out of Dwayne Reed  And I'd throw her some butts  I'd call her the bird lady  Because she has kind of one of those weird bird hats  She does?  Yeah  You know what it is, though?  You give her something  And then she expects it every day  You walk by her  And she gives you the eye  Like, you gave me something yesterday  Come on, fess up again  Jesus Christ  You're not going to be a tax deduction  When I was living in L.A. 
[00:58:30]  I bought a homeless guy a piece of pizza  Yeah, oh, wow  That's like giving someone a call  I walk out  I say, hey, here you go, man  He goes, pepperoni  Ah, I can't eat it  I go, I'm picky  It's bad for you?  You've been living on boogers and screw-top wine  And my pizza's not good for you?  He's watching his weight, Adam  Can you blame him?  Anthony, but what you were saying about her expecting something  And you gave her something yesterday?  Yeah  That's the listeners of the Open Anthony Show  All right  Hey, you gave me something yesterday  We had something today  Hey, sorry 
[00:59:00]  You got nothing  We're trying  You'll get nothing and like it  Right  But maybe we'll give you something tomorrow  We might have to move to another corner  We feel generous  We did it every day  It wouldn't be special  All right  Rick actually has a clip from Homeless Shopping Spree  Where we met Ziggy for the first time  Yeah  Ziggy will be on the Homeless Shopping Spree this year  Coming up Tuesday with  Tippy Tom  Who would have thought that Ziggy would still be alive two years later  When we saw him, I was sure he'd have been beaten and killed or died of some disease 
[00:59:30]  But no, he lives on  Think of other people Ziggy's outlived  Now what sucks about the Homeless Shopping Spree  Ziggy went back to his corner with some great stuff  Seriously, really nice jacket  Yeah  Keep him warm in the winter  New shoes  I think it was Nikes or something he got  Yeah, yeah  And nice gloves and stuff  And we checked in with him, what, a week later?  He got his ass kicked  He got his ass kicked  He got mugged  And they took his stuff  They took his new stuff  Swear you  I got beat up for his entire time 
[01:00:00]  Ziggy, who beat you up?  I don't know, but he was singing  We were after it  No  Tippy Tom probably beat him up  He outlived George Harrison  Who saw that coming?  Oh, man  Yeah, but Ziggy will be part of the Homeless Shopping Spree  And here's a little clip where we met him for the first time as he walked into the studio  Yeah  Hey, what's your name, bro?  Ziggy, Ziggy  Hey, Ziggy, what's happening?  I love your comic strip  It's funny  Hey, Ziggy, you've ever been to Paisano's? 
[01:00:30]  That's what I was a kid, I had to read comics books  Oh, yeah  That's when I got caught in the hallway  What does he do with?  I got caught in the hallway carrying a bottle of Deval up the steps  What?  It broke on the steps and I got two cuts on there  Right  And all the blood came out and my mother put my hands underneath the faucet  Yeah  And you could still see them  Really?  Sure, then after that I went to a glass window 
[01:01:00]  Yeah  And got two glasses of things stuck in my hand  It's impossible how it didn't go through the rest of the body  Huh  Ziggy, watch out  Ziggy, step aside  Ziggy, watch out  Ziggy, Ziggy  Oh, that kind of hurts 
[01:01:30]  Ow  Oh, that must have hurt  Oh, watch this upgrade  A couple months  Wow  To take a train  He just kept going even after the train hit him  You know, listening to Ziggy talk is like Anthony trying to explain a computer game to me  Well, there was some stuff in there  Are you sure?  Ziggy Tom's going to give him a run for his money this year, though  You watch 
[01:02:00]  I believe he was talking about something going into his hand  I don't know what's in the room  I've heard that three times  I have no idea what's in the room  It went through a glass window or something  James, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, O'Neill?  Hey  Hey, I just wanted you to look for guys to, you know, kind of sponsor your homeless guys on the shopping spree  Or donate some cash to the fund  No, here's the deal  When you guys find out what mall we're going to this coming Tuesday  You show up and you can do whatever you want  These guys  We only gave them $100 each  Yep  These guys went home with a ton of stuff from our listeners 
[01:02:30]  Yeah, like they were buying them stuff  They were picking their favorite homeless person and buying them stuff  And that's fine, too  We give them $100  But most of them spent that on boost  On the return trip  We're the only guys that, like, take homeless people that might have alcoholism problems  And load them up on a bus full of beers and booze  And get them all down  We're enablers  Of course  Complete enablers  So, James, Tuesday we'll announce them all 
[01:03:00]  And if you want to go there and help them out, that would be great  Right on, man  All right  All right, thanks a lot, guys  All right, bye  Adam, if I could use one of your lines  Please do  This is hospitaliano for the homeless  Olive Garden call back in  I thought we weren't going to hear that today  I still love the fact that my pal was in an Olive Garden commercial  Oh, God  Hospitaliano  He was the first hospitaliano  No, he was the second hospitaliano guy  I was the second guy  You were second  I was the second guy  The second guy  What was your line?

[01:04:30]  And the actresses or actors  Sit there and go  You know, I never thought I had that in me  But Tommy brought it out  And, you know, Tommy is more the person I want to be  This is the role that you've been wanting to play your entire life  And, you know, my family has to deal with  It's so hard for me to come out of the character  When I get done with the shoot for the day  Because I go around like Tommy  For days on end  But thank you

Well, I don't know  He divorced my mom  He would always say to my brother and I  I grew up in the Great Depression  And we would say, you're lying  He did not  He said, yeah, I did  Your mother's  And then he'd start fighting  That's pretty good  That's funny  That's why  You've a Great Depression  Your mother's  And then he sold my brother a stolen car

No, but like it was summer break from school  Yeah  And like, you know, he was like semi-normal for a while there 
[01:07:30]  You know, he would be like in and out of rehab  And so I was 12 and school was out  So she said I could go visit him  And that was the last time I ever saw him  And did you have to sit there and watch him in these drug binges?  Well, no, because I, like, that was like the first time I'd seen him in like years, so  Did he ever, did he ever hit you?  No, never, never  But you were 12, so you had to live with him  Yeah, when I was young  By that time, you couldn't just leave  No, but I called my mom and she like immediately made me go back

Would it be, well, this would be within the radius, the 40-mile radius  Are we going to trick everyone and go right back to the Short Hills Mall?  Oh, possibly  Are we going to stay right here in Manhattan?  Come on  Where could it be?  All right, thanks, guys  You'll find out Tuesday  All right, here's the clip of Ziggy farting on the bus as they head to the mall two years ago

I do do Medford once in a while, but no  Area 51  Well, you've got to explain to everyone else around the country  Governor's is a fine comedy club 
[01:12:30]  Levittown has been there for a really long time  Long Island, New York  And they decided to branch out  They have their sister club  Yeah, they decided that Medford needed a comedy club  Medford, for those of you who don't know  Medford's not even on the map  No  The saucers land there  Right  It's like if you were in Los Angeles  And they had a comedy club there  It's like putting another one on the tip of Baja, California  Mexico  Somewhere around there  Come on down, it's scorpion sting night  If you've been stung by a bug, you get in free 
[01:13:00]  They don't know what's funny  Out in Medford  Right  But they got one out there  And it does pretty well  Their sister club  But the comedians ain't going out there  They're going out there from New York  It's like a two-hour ride  Oh, it's crazy  You keep going out, you start hearing banjo music  And there's nothing  Yeah, when it gets to the point where there's no more street lights  Yeah  And you know, it's pitch black except for your headlights  It's kind of scary  You want to go down to the crop circles and make a laugh?

[01:14:00]  So grab it now because they are putting out a crap version where you can't do as much  Now we just got a copy today and I hope it's not the crap version  No  No, we got the full version  Greg, it's not the crap version, right?  Better not be a crap version  No, we got it right from the people who make the game  Yeah  Why can't we have the freedom to buy anything we like no matter how violent and vile it is?  Vince, there are people out there that make these decisions for you  To protect us, Opie?  Just relax  Let them make the decisions for you  Maybe I'm not understanding that 
[01:14:30]  Okay  You don't have time to make these decisions  You have to  You're too busy preparing for a radio show  Ah  Let them do that  That's it  Okay  They're looking out for you  As long as somebody's protecting me, then I guess it's okay  Are you trying  Alright, I'll give up my right to entertain myself  You're trying to say we have free will or something like that?  I would like to think we do  Silly boy  Silly boy  The naivety just makes me giggle  They will decide what's too violent for us, Anthony 
[01:15:00]  The best part of games is the violence in it  Unless there is some form of killing in a game  It's not entertaining to me  I'm not going to sit there and play the games that come with your computer  Don't play computer games  Play Dungeons and Dragons and cut your sister's throat  That's much better  I like games that are violent  But are they rated the games?  Yeah, they are rated  That rating system is silly, though 
[01:15:30]  We all know it  If you're a parent  And you're going into a video store  A video game store  And you're buying a game for your kids for Christmas  Look at the rating  Make sure it's a nice cuddly game  That they're going to throw at your head when you're sleeping, I hope  And get them that  But just because there's another one next to it that has so high violence and gore and everything like that  Don't then take up a cause to have that removed  People enjoy that  Last night, I'm playing Castle Wolfenstein, right?  I go into a room  This Nazi goes, please don't shoot me 
[01:16:00]  And he's on his knees and he's shaking  And the graphics are great  And his arms are waving  That always bothers me in the game, though  I love it  It makes me feel like I have a heart  I kind of felt bad for him  But he's like  Please, the lever on the left is broken  You will have to go upstairs and turn the crank by hand to launch the rocket  Please don't  At least he's giving me all this info and stuff  And I'm like, sorry there, Fritz  Pow!  And just blew his head off right there  And then I've got to stand and look at him for a while 
[01:16:30]  Look at my handiwork  I like that  You couldn't let him go?  No!  You know why?  Saving Private Ryan  Yes, absolutely  I let him go  Kill him  Guaranteed, I go upstairs, I'm cranking the handle  And that kraut bastard's going to shift me  Yep  No  Dead  Dead  I kill people that I don't even have to kill  There was one guy, I burst into a room  He's supposed to be working a crane  And I'm not sure if I was supposed to let him complete what he was doing or not  I come running in, I see people, I spray them  This guy just fell on the floor, he has his little construction hat on 
[01:17:00]  He wasn't even on  I didn't care, it's a game  Why you do that?  Ah, please  Another instant feedback about Grand Theft Auto 3  Anthony from PA  Make sure you get the ultimate violence code when you play GTA 3  Or you won't be able to have the people's body parts blow off when you shoot them  Without the code, there is still blood, but the body parts stay attached  What, you've got to get the code?  A crack code or something?  That's it  The ultimate violence code?  The UBC  Good  Ultimate violence code  Someone better email me that code, I need that if we're going to play this game 
[01:17:30]  Stuff rocks!  You know what they should do? Put the violent games behind the beads, like porno  Oh, so you go into the store and it's behind the beads  You go behind, like the porno beads  How dirty do you feel going through those beads?  And I always buy, like, a cover movie when I come out  Right  You know, your Disney flick or something  Yeah, Dishonorable Discharge and Dumbo  All in the days?  Yeah  You walk through those beads  And a little worm behind the counter looks at you  You buy the forearm and fist-sized dildo  What? 
[01:18:00]  Oh, did I go a little too far?  Hey, is that him off?  Is this the thing that you've got?  Oh, my ears are burning  Jay, you just wake up?  Yeah, this is a comic  Of course you just woke up  I drove in from the University of Rhode Island last night  I was up all night with Lamar's bong  Wow, look at your eyes, you've got that tippy-tom look  I'm fighting a cold  I just heard you guys talking about porno  My ears are ringing in the air  Yeah  How about those Wild West doors  You've got to walk through to get into the porno  Oh, yeah, yeah  The Wild West doors  So you can only see my feet and my face  I'm here to buy some porno, partner 
[01:18:30]  And they never oil them  You walk in  I like your slipping down an alley, too  You kind of stand by the door, look around  And then slowly turn and go through the door  You've got to look and see if somebody's watching you go through the door  I really have only one rule, Anthony  And that is don't make a wrong turn  Yeah  Yeah  You don't want to be at the wall of, you know, the wall of the seas  That's when you find out  Just stare at it  I know  Because I've done that by accident  Yeah  Because you've got to get your bearings first 
[01:19:00]  Sometimes you just go, I'm going in, I'm going left  I'm going in  I'm going left  You go left, what is that?  A wall of man's sea  And you know, you don't have the reaction you think you're going to have  Which is, ew  You go, wow  You've got so many penises on the wall  Why am I still standing here?  Sometimes you look and you're looking for the girl  Because it's like some kind of weird position  So you're looking and going, all right 
[01:19:30]  Where's, this is a porno movie  Where's the girl  Oh my god, I've been staring now at a game  Of too long I've been staring at this  Sorry to bust in on you guys  Jerry Moore  Jerry  Watch out now  I've never seen you look like this on Fox  I feel privileged that you come in like this  On Fox?  Yeah, you're a mess  You're a tad misheveled  I just came out of the shower  I see no golden hanger or one from this appearance  You've got like  An NFL fleece on  That's nice  You've got a goatee half 
[01:20:00]  Yeah, I look like a Westie  I look like the Westie that didn't get in any fights  Hey, Anthony, look at this  We're going to wing it with Jay Moore  Winging it with Jay Moore  We don't want people to think that we planned a Jay Moore visit today  No, no, no  That would mean we're working too hard on our show  We just wing the show, Jerry  Jay, one of our program directors is accusing us of just winging our show  She's a hero  She's a hero  Okay  Can I hear that?  I just went out of town too long 
[01:20:30]  Can I hear all the treats?  Oh, you've got to hear that  That is one of my favorite sound clips  You know, he was in Goonies  Yeah  How could you guys be accused of being too pre-programmed?  It's a free-for-all  She was a hoo-er  That's why  You want to hear our new favorite?  Pucker up and kiss my ass!  That's a good one  Big Vince, baby  Vince McMahon  But even better, Stone Cold  You've got to hear the Stone Cold one  Hold on  Did I do that? 
[01:21:00]  Good morning, everybody.  I think I have Stone Cold.  What happened to my Ramones record?  You have Stone Cold.  Is that supposed to be sexy?  Isn't that great?  Is that supposed to be sexy?  That sounds like Mr. Belvedere.  You're the ugliest stripper I've ever seen in my life.  And you know he's seen some ugly hobs.  Ah, you know, Stone Cold.  Before he was Stone Cold, when he was like, Mike.  Rolling from, like, Raleigh-Durham Strip Club to Raleigh-Durham Strip Club. 
[01:21:30]  I already gave you a dollar, honey.  Show it to me.  They're already out.  And I'm covering up my beer because I know it's falling out of that thing.  Stop asking me if I want to buy the lady a drink.  Are you going to kiss my ass or not?  On your knees.  Goddamn.  Wow.  Now, are they both WWF?  Oh, yeah.  So you could just play that and make your own tape of Vince and Stone Cold having gay sex in the porno room. 
[01:22:00]  Right.  Tie it all together for you.  Did it already?  Did it.  I've been away too long.  That's a ass.  Hey, Gary.  Eleven-year-old Gary wants to say hi to Jay Moore.  Eleven-year-old Gary.  Gary.  Hey, Jay Moore.  What's up?  I love the show Behind the Glory.  Oh, you're watching Gary, Beyond the Glory.  He's only eleven years old, but he has a six-inch you-know-what.  Oh, God.  You're the best, man.  You've got stones, I can tell.  You must be like the coolest guy in your school.  Hell, yeah.  Yeah. 
[01:22:30]  Hope you're supposed to take him to an Islander game.  You know, I've got the Mots.  I'll take him to an Islander game.  I've got the Mots.  You're only going to see half the game, kid.  You know that.  Yeah, we've got to pick a weekend game, Gary.  Okay.  And I just wanted to say about, you know, Anthony, talking about the Army games.  Yeah.  Uh, two words for me.  No survivors.  I kill everybody.  No survivors.  Even if it's a child.  I'll say hi, little kid.  Boom.  Sorry, I blew off your head, but, you know, I had to do it. 
[01:23:00]  That's supposed to be sexy.  Hey, let me hear you do a dice impression.  For me?  Yeah.  No.  No.  I don't know any jokes that he does.  He sucks anyway.  Take it easy.  Hey, hey, kid.  I'll call the cops.  Boom.  Boom.  He's doing bop.  Boom.  Boom.  Boom.  Boom.  Boom.  Where do you live, Gary?  No, I just wanted to say, too, um, you know, Alan Ferrara said he got the first computer? 
[01:23:30]  Yeah.  Alan Ferrara bought his computer when, uh, Voss started making his jokes.  Taring on Rich Voss.  Very funny.  It's just so even an 11-year-old can do it.  Thank you, buddy.  You're the best.  I know.  Hey, you guys suck, kid.  I guess.  No, you suck.  I know the struggle, kid.  That kid's cool.  Rich Voss playing a country club in Switzerland.  Look at the black chick checking me out.  Playing a Klan rally.  Look at the black guy checking me out. 
[01:24:00]  You know what they say, once you go black, you go right back to white.  You'd think I'd fix my teeth.  Melt down somebody's Jewish charms around my neck and get a goddamn killing.  Guy wears 11 charms.  His tattoos are 1,500 right there.  But he's got Star of David tattoos, which is a complete contradiction.  You're not supposed to tattoo yourself.  You can't have tattoos if you're Jewish.  In the Jewish religion.  Yeah, I can't be buried in a Jewish cemetery myself.  Well, good thing.  Yeah, I'm not Jewish.  I don't care.  But I'm saying, I'm agreeing. 
[01:24:30]  Tattoos have nothing to do with it.  Right.  I'm essentially saying word, to your point, about Voss and his list.  All right, we've got to take a break.  Adam Farrar, he's in the studio.  He's playing Governor's Thursday, Friday and Saturday in Levittown.  Jay's playing Hofstra tonight, I believe.  Yeah.  And then tomorrow night, we're going to stick to it, Rascals, real quick.  Rock and roll, hit it and quit.  Tomorrow or Friday?  Friday.  Friday.  What's tomorrow?  It's Friday.  No, it's Thursday.  Tomorrow's Thursday, Todd.  You don't like Jay.  There's nothing but love in the light.  Dude, man, I've been flying.  Oh, come on.  I've lost time under hypnotism.  Wow. 
[01:25:00]  I've been sleeping gate to gate.  He looks like a prisoner from Castle Wolfenstein.  I'll tell you one thing.  Looks like he's joined the Taliban.  I can still wax some ass, I'll tell you that much, buddy.  That's right.  Jay Moore!  That 11-year-old knows.  Yeah.  He's got a hot mom.  Watch out.  I will catch up.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, bang!  We'll catch up with Jay Moore next.  Yeah.  As we continue to wing it on the L.P. and Anthony Show.  How old are you?  All right.  Four years.  I'll show you to them.  Wow.  Fabulous!  Wow.  Holy ravioli! 
[01:25:30]  Opie and Anthony.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hey!  You two playing the Super Bowl this year, Ant.  Yeah, I heard that.  Jay Moore in the studio.  Adam Farrar in the studio.  Govinders!  Oh!  Island!  What?  Govinders in Long Island.  Long Island.  That's for Adam Farrar.  Is that Levitown?  Levitown.  It's a nice show, man.  It's nice.  Better than this. 
[01:26:00]  They get into it.  It's like a U2 show when you see Adam Farrar.  Yeah.  You're just happy.  You feel elevated.  That's it.  There's a rope patrol with a big thing in the background.  It's a big lemon.  Can I have a big lemon behind you?  Lou, what's up?  What's up, ONA?  How you doing?  Pretty good.  I just want to say, Jay Moore, you've got to do your impersonation of Christopher Walken.  It's killing.  I can't believe it.  People love that.  Dude, it's awesome.  Well, thank you, Lou, if that's your real name.  But I assume you're Italian. 
[01:26:30]  You walk around with your olive oil voice and your guinea charm.  It's crazy.  You'll never be in my movie.  Let me know if I can't refuse.  I want to do...  Walken and Larry Merchant are kind of...  Larry Merchant's as retarded as Walken, I found out.  Like, after a fight, I'll be interviewing Roy Jones.  I'll go, now, James...  Here, I watched on the docks today a man bring in a 2,000-pound tuna. 
[01:27:00]  Roy certainly...  Goddamn.  I just crapped my pants.  I'm a midget.  No one knows I'm a midget, Roy.  Sheer will.  Sheer will.  Once...  You're the best.  No, you are, Lou.  Once, Roberto Duran said, no moss today or tonight.  Roy Jones Jr., plenty of moss. 
[01:27:30]  That guy's a jackass.  Jim Lampley hates him.  You know what's funny about Jim Lampley?  When he calls you at home, he sounds like that all the time.  Jay Moore, Jim Lampley calling.  Wanted to know if you could give me a call back.  Ow!  Oh, hey!  Now it's mine.  Jim Lampley, Jay Moore, what do you say we get the gals together and go out for a bite to eat?  Jim, here's a...  How about Howard Letterman?  You ever hear that guy?  No.  The guy when they go, let's see what Howard Letterman's scorecard is. 
[01:28:00]  The guy's always like in the, you know, the pet offensive they report live.  I got him five rounds of four-fourths.  And that's all I got him so far.  Literally.  Look at Jim, he's winging it, Anthony.  I don't know what fight Mr. Letterman is watching.  I have it eight rounds for Nipsey Russell.  Two rounds for Frank Stallone.  None of this is written down.  All up the top.  A man in a suit said the show was too scripted. 
[01:28:30]  Well, Jim, I can tell you, I don't know where this impression's going because I smoke hippie lettuce.  I got nothing.  All right, let's go to Christina.  I got nothing.  Please go to someone.  I got nothing.  It's a new impression.  Leave me alone.  Christina, you're next on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  What's up, fellas?  Hey.  I have a question.  So I go to Hofstra.  I'm a graduate student, and I saw this sign up yesterday for Jay Moore.  I went to go against the tickets, and the chick wasn't there that was selling them. 
[01:29:00]  So I go to the information center.  They tell me to come back between 9 and 5 tomorrow.  So I get off work.  I come jetting over.  The flute left early.  I got there 4.30.  She wasn't there.  So they sent me all around campus trying to find these damn tickets.  And no one can tell me if it's sold out or if I can get them at the door.  Just hold on, and we'll put you on hold.  We'll get your name.  We'll get you in for free, and everything's fine.  Oh.  Oh, you're off the catwalk.  Whoa.  I got to go right.  You're a filthy little animal. 
[01:29:30]  Right to the source.  You know, maybe, as Keitel would say in bed, Lieutenant, can't you do something for me?  Maybe you do something for me.  A couple beautiful girls can't get tickets to the Jay Moore show.  Remember, you're smoking grass?  You have a sucker C?  Do it, you couple bad girls.  I'll take you in.  Don't talk back to me.  I'll take you right in.  Sounds like snagglepuss.  Danny, Danny.  I just want a fan.  That's on.  Christina, hold on, okay?  Thanks.  You guys are out. 
[01:30:00]  All right.  You're Walter for this girl.  Thanks, Rick.  Hey, we should get them right in, man.  Yeah.  Do you know who's outside?  Who's outside?  Am I going to get hit?  No.  I'm not going to get hit.  Just give me a heads up so I can get the Adam's apple shot in.  It has happened before.  No, you will not get hit.  What a handshake this guy has.  Really?  I'm going to crush my hand.  Is it like Creskin's?  Hold on.  Creskin as a good handshake?  Creskin shakes your arm and he's squeezing.  He's all crazy.  That's why he guesses everything, because he shakes the crap out of you.  He shakes it out of your pocket.  You tell him your life story. 
[01:30:30]  Just bring him in and listen.  Oh, I have a sister in class.  Let's see how long it takes Jay Moore to figure out who it is.  All right.  It's been a few years, though.  I don't know hockey.  Huh?  Hey!  Right on, baby.  Watch out.  Look at this guy.  What an animal.  This is back, man.  What's up, Jimmy?  How you doing?  Real pleasure, man.  It's Jim Craig, man.  Of course it's Jim Craig.  Yes.  Can you believe in miracles?  Hell yeah. 
[01:31:00]  Wow.  Then you went to the Flames in Atlanta, right?  That's right.  I thought you said you didn't know hockey.  I know an Olympian.  No, I know that.  I know a guy.  That's not hockey.  That's America, right?  Where's my father?  Where's my father?  That's him.  Do you believe in miracles?  Yes!  He's just sitting like, oh, Jesus Christ.  Craig, what was it like when the Russians are bearing down on you and you're just like,  what do they look like up close?  Were they scary?  I mean, because there was such a myth about, like, the Russians.  Like Dolph Lundgren coming at you.  Yeah, like, when you're in the goal, were they just like these cyberbots that knew how 
[01:31:30]  to play hockey?  Did they talk trash to you?  No, it sounded like that Rocky movie where they had the big Russian fighter.  Yes.  I must break you.  I must break you.  They weren't like, oh, you suck.  Like, just saying stupid stuff to you?  No.  Did they speak any English at all?  No.  I bet they do now because everyone wants to live here in $7 million a year.  They're cabbies.  It's not like back in the Craig days.  We had to earn your keep.  Back then.  Andy Malhotra, for crying out loud, makes a couple mil.  You know what it was?  Every little victory against the evil Soviet Union back then was just a boost for American 
[01:32:00]  morale, and you threw it right at them.  They were supposed to be the big shots, and you guys kicked their ass.  What a moment for America.  Yeah, it sure was a great time.  Yeah.  Speak up, man.  Come on.  Break it down.  What, did you write a book or something?  No.  You're just there hanging out?  You working for Allstate?  Yeah.  Allstate's bringing our team back for a 20-year reunion.  Really?  You've got to spit that out on the radio.  How the hell did that time go by that fest?  Jesus. 
[01:32:30]  We've never been together.  Our team has never been together in 22 years.  Really?  Why?  What happened?  They all got busy after that game.  Really?  Yeah.  Ken Morrow went to win a Stanley Cup.  Ken Morrow, no doubt about it, went to win a Stanley Cup.  We'll be back on Mike and the Meds.  Hey, Jim.  Only guy to win a gold medal and a Stanley Cup in the same year, right, Jim?  Yep.  Don't rub it in.  Four of them.  Are you sick of talking about the big game or what?  No, because it was a great event for everybody. 
[01:33:00]  And I think, you know, the tragedy of September 11th kind of reminds everybody of terrible things that happened.  And I think our team and the event reminds people of some great things that happened.  And the climate right now has been kind of similar.  So it's great to be remembered in a way that people are happy because there's too many tragedies.  Jim Craig, U.S. Olympic hockey goalie.  That's it.  Olympian gold medalist, 1980 Lake Placid.  Where were you?  We want to know.  Cole Opie and Anthony and Anna Farrar and Jay Moore and Ben and Jim Craig. 
[01:33:30]  Now take my sister to the airport.  You still have the flag?  I do.  Oh, yeah?  Where's that hanging?  Actually, now it's up in the third floor office.  Nice.  Right next to your Frank Stallone poster.  There you go.  The legendary flag.  What guy parlayed the gold medal?  Right next to the gold medal.  Nice.  There you go.  I was with Julie Fowdy one night and she said...  Man, drop.  You know what?  That's what I'll drop.  That's how cool she is.  And I said, you also want a silver. 
[01:34:00]  She goes, Jay, we like to refer to it as white gold.  Oh, there you go.  She's hilarious and hot.  And man, can she have...  Hey, what guy on the U.S. Olympic team parlayed that medal into the most amount of chicks?  What guy was just hitting the bars night after night?  You know who I am?  You know what this is?  Get on it, honey.  It was Micah Ruzzioni in a big silk...  Dad Kenny.  Come here.  Come here.  Not only want to sleep with you, I can get you a deal on some tires.  Come here.  What do you need?  A bit of Ruzzioni. 
[01:34:30]  I'm sure it was.  Craig's playing it close to the vest today.  He's not sure what he's in for.  We're in awe of you, man.  You were a surprise guest.  They wouldn't let us know who it was.  He was sticking it to the Soviets.  Wow.  Now, you know something?  If that damn Taliban had a hockey team, I bet we'd beat them, too.  Beat them.  Beat them back.  You can't skate on sand, right?  No.  Absolutely not.  They drowned in spring training.  What?  You know what's great is that...  That's the Polish team.  Right.  Oh, yeah.  What?  You are.  Excuse me.  You have a harsh chocolate shell.  Think of how we feel about the Taliban. 
[01:35:00]  That's how we felt about the Russians.  Oh, you don't got to tell me.  Ronnie Reagan came in and cleaned up that problem.  What was the energy like before the gold medal game?  A lot of people think maybe you guys beat the Russians for the gold medal, but you didn't.  That was just to get to the gold medal.  Yeah, that was to get you to the gold medal.  And who did you play?  The Czechs or the U...  Who did you play for the gold medal?  Finland.  Finland.  Finland, I'm sorry.  Oh, Finland.  I just woke up, Jim.  With their cheese.  So, were you guys...  Was there more pressure on?  Because now that you put away the Soviets, was it like, well, now we better win because,  you know...  Yeah.  It was a cakewalk.  Or was it laid back?  Like, who cares what happens? 
[01:35:30]  It was a cakewalk from there.  No, we were underdogs until we played the Finns.  And then we were favorites.  So, as a favorite, to win a gold medal, that has the most pressure.  Plus, if we didn't win that game, we had a chance to win...  We had a chance not to medal at all.  And not many people...  Oh, that's right.  Yeah.  You wouldn't have got anything.  Right.  Because it was done...  Take it easy.  No, I'm very excited.  Yeah, it was done on total points and goals for, goals against.  And, you know, unfortunately, you had a guy, a teammate, a great guy, Janisak, who never  got a chance to play because the way they were going for most goals for, at least goals 
[01:36:00]  against.  It was right up until the last game.  So, we had really won nothing except had a great victory against a big rival.  Man, this is the best ever.  Jim Craig, man, in studio.  I need to come to my show.  Someone jump in.  Don't worry about it, man.  Let's go to Carl.  Carl, what's up?  What's up, buddy?  Hey, what's up, guys?  It is cool.  Usually, there's, like, big, fat lesbians and stuff.  It's Jim Craig.  He's an American hero.  Did you bring big, fat lesbians, Craig?  Craig, her?  No.  Come on, Craig.  Help us out, man. 
[01:36:30]  The Craigster.  Carl's on the line.  Yeah, Carl, what's up?  Carl.  What's up, guys?  Yeah, I just wanted to tell Jim Craig that I'm a 25-year-old guy.  I played hockey.  And I saw that special on HBO after the September 11th following.  And I got to tell him, I cried, man.  It made me feel so proud to be an American.  Yeah, and I think that's a great thing about it.  It was awesome.  Cool, Carl.  Our team is that we didn't try to capitalize on any commercialism.  It wasn't a big deal.  And, you know, for so many Olympics, we were so tired of somebody or somebody's agent grabbing a flag 
[01:37:00]  and telling them how to wave it and do everything else.  You know, after that tragedy, you saw flags come out like you did in Lake Placid.  And you know it's not commercialized.  It's very special.  And, you know, when you lose somebody, like a lot of New Yorkers did, not only a building but, you know, family and friends,  it's nice to know that everybody can rally around and this can be a special spot.  And, you know, not to be sentimental on a show like yours, but I think it's...  That's all right.  We do it sometimes.  He pointed to me when he said that.  It's important.  And, you know, not to plug Allstate, but Allstate's bringing our team together. 
[01:37:30]  And we're going to have a clinic here in New York City.  Wow.  And we're going to help the kids and be part of a big deal.  And I know I'm going to be coming back in March to be part of that firefighter and the police game that they're going to have.  They're going to have to raise money.  And when you think of the firefighters here jumping into that building, just giving up your life because that's what they're trained to do.  And, you know, it's just incredible.  And, you know, to do something positive means a lot to me. 
[01:38:00]  And our team is a good symbol to do that.  And a lot of athletes don't want to take that responsibility of being a role model.  But our team is very comfortable with that.  It's just a historic American team, American story.  Do you ever kick yourself for not ripping your shirt off after you won, like Brandi Chastain, for the commercial endorsements after your career was over?  Like, were there nights when you were just sitting on the couch eating ramen noodles going, I could have whipped down my, you know, I could have taken my crank out on TV for everybody?  You're a crank.  That's great, Jay Moore.  That's great.  An American hero.  American hero legend.  It started getting a little melancholia. 
[01:38:30]  Just steer it back.  Look at the guy with the tie writing down your name.  Jay Moore.  Jay Moore.  That's all right.  I pay a lot of taxes.  Believe me, you want me alive.  You're embarrassing our guest there, Jay.  No, no, he's my man.  But Allstate, we're all in good hands, baby.  Allstate, that's my insurance company.  If you don't have Allstate, I don't know what the hell you're doing with yourself.  I've got to get with the Allstate.  I must say, it's not often that we're in awe, but we're in awe today.  Yeah.  I feel like we're all just like Chris Barley on SNL.  I'm trying to pick up the slack.  Went on the barometer of... 
[01:39:00]  You played in the greatest game ever.  I didn't see it.  You didn't see it.  What game was that?  That's when Dukes of Hazzard was on then, man.  Hey, John, what's going on?  Hey, I just want to thank Jim Craig.  I've got a picture in my office of him.  I've had it for years.  It's Jim Holden, the American flag and a goalie stick, and it has an inspirational message.  And since he just said something, I just checked the bottom of it, and it said that they've  reprinted it with his courtesy, which I doubt they ever did.  That's probably true, but if it did what you said it did for you, then it's worth it. 
[01:39:30]  All right.  But, Jim, thanks a lot.  That was a great, great moment.  All right.  Thank you, John.  All right.  Have a good day, guys.  Let's go to John in D.C.  Hey, John, you're on with Jim Craig.  Hey, Jim, how you doing?  I want to know you guys rule.  I'm one of your five listeners in D.C.  Thank you.  We're up to about 42 in D.C.  Oh, wow.  I'm one of the original five.  You guys are great.  Hey, listen, Jim, I'm a big hockey fan.  I remember watching that game.  I'm 35, and I'd watch that game, and we went nuts.  We weren't crying or nothing.  We were going nuts.  You guys played great that game. 
[01:40:00]  Kill those commies.  I would watch that with you.  Get out of here.  We were at the apartment.  Are you high?  What do you know?  I don't remember that.  I can act in front of Northern Ireland.  Jim Craig, did you know Boomer Esiason?  Yes, I do.  Did you know that Anthony Elementary School broke his arm punching Boomer Esiason in the face?  Yeah.  Didn't know that.  Yeah, Boomer, we went to the same elementary school.  You can have fun here also.  We went to the same elementary school together, and I called them Normans.  This doesn't look like work for you guys.  Nah.  You know what I mean?  You want a beer?  We've got plenty of them around here. 
[01:40:30]  Hey, John, did you have a play?  No and not yes.  You know, we can do it.  Yeah, I want to know if Jim Craig comes down to D.C. if he wants to go to a Caps game with me.  Ugh.  Well, I'm going to be at the Caps game.  We're actually going to have a clinic in Washington, so maybe you can swing by when we do that autograph  session and help out with the kids.  When's the clinic in D.C.?  It's next Thursday.  In the 23rd here in New York, right?  Washington.  Tonight.  Who's your favorite team?  I'm going to put you on the spot.  I don't have a favorite team.  I have no favorite players.  Islanders? 
[01:41:00]  Come on, Islanders.  Who's your favorite players?  Ty Domi, Ulf Samuelsson?  Osgood.  No, no.  Ozzy.  I hate those guys.  You know, I'm really glad to see Osgood go to the Islanders and do so well, but I like  Pavel Belray.  You know, he's a really exciting type player.  Did he have sex with Anna Kornikova, or is that the other Russian guy?  I guess.  The other Russian guy.  I think they both did.  I think there was like a turnstile.  Oh.  Stop it.  No, when you go to a game, that's how they count how many people go to the hockey rink,  is they've got to count how many people go to the hockey rink.  It's Anna Kornikova.  Oz.  Don't ruin our fantasy.  I'd rather have, would you rather have Serena Williams, or, I know you're a happily married 
[01:41:30]  man, and you know, you're a viable-fearing, good, kind soul, but, you know, just off the  record, who knows?  No one listens to the show, right?  Put the book down when you come in this studio.  Anna Kornikova or Serena Williams, just for a weekend.  You're out Sunday night.  Early flight Sunday night, you're out.  Like, no, no.  This guy from Hills and Knowlton, guys, is freaking out.  Don't answer me, man.  He's freaking out.  The guy with the tie going in.  That's twice, Jay Moore.  That's twice.  Ask him why he's freaking.  Why are you freaking?  Because he's from the firm.  Hills and Knowlton, they did the Ford Focus Tour. 
[01:42:00]  Yeah, everything's got to be.  He was on my back at Queens College, this guy.  Oh, really?  But I cursed Anna.  You're like a Boston program director.  I like the underdog.  Everything's like to be on the upper.  Well, that would be Anna.  That's a big underdog.  Man, look at it.  Are you going to...  Do you have any plans of going into politics, Jim?  No.  None whatsoever?  None.  You're just going to put on clinics and ride off into the sunset helping kids?  That's a good way.  You know, I'm really excited that we're, you know, Herbie's going to be the coach of this  team again.  The love bug? 
[01:42:30]  Yeah.  Our coach, Herb Brooks.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Herbie.  You know him.  Carl Mulden played him in the movie.  Oh, Carl Mulden's going to coach?  Under his zoom nose.  We get to go back and watch these NHL All-Stars play the fantasy game and then see Herbie have  to take these guys who are pretty spoiled and try to make them really focus on a mission.  And I think he can because he doesn't care.  He's not trying to advance his career.  And I think it would be good.  I think we need a win here. 
[01:43:00]  We haven't won in a long time.  When was the last time you actually suited up and played?  Yeah.  He's wearing skates right now.  I'm next to him.  No, I don't play goal.  But I am going for this game because it's the right thing to do.  That'd be boring to watch you play goal.  I want to see you hit some people.  Yeah.  Goon it up.  Mustah Muhammad.  Oh, no!  And grubbing Mullah Omar right in the left corner.  Donald Prashear is dead. 
[01:43:30]  He's not going to come back.  Oh, my God.  He's not going to come back.  It's all about the All-State.  He'll come back.  The guy with the tie won't let him back.  It's not every day.  We've got an Olympic hero in the studio and he's not going to come back.  Look, the bottom line is Jim Craig is putting on clinics for children, getting the team back together, sponsored by All-State.  It's going to be in every damn city in this phenomenal country we live in.  Jim, I'll do all the plugs for you.  And you'll just videotape this for him.  He is the plug king.  He's the best at you.  You can then use it on a...  Jim, I'll tell you what. 
[01:44:00]  If you're around, I'm at Governor's Thursday, Friday, Saturday.  Yeah, you like comedy?  I'm at Rascals Friday night.  Two shows.  Rascals.  Unbelievable.  I'll let you in half price.  My daughter's birthday is coming up the 18th.  I'm going to be in town.  Nice.  How old is your daughter?  She's only nine.  What have you been up to since the game?  No one has ever asked you.  Dude, that's a 30-year question.  Get off the guy's bed.  It's easy.  In a nutshell.  It's been 20.  In a nutshell.  It's 22 years.  Still breathing.  I work for Valassas in the Valassas retail sales as a market service consultant. 
[01:44:30]  And then I do motivational speaking.  Oh.  You know, whatever Michael doesn't want to do, I call America's guest.  He's going to pass around and pick up whatever he doesn't want, you know?  And had it motivational speaking.  And had a kid or two.  Yeah.  I've got a great family.  Nice wife.  How many kids have you got?  A son and daughter.  James and our daughter's Taylor, so it's really easy to remember James Taylor.  We stayed with the man-to-man defense.  Didn't go to the zone.  You should have named them Jethro and Tull.  Yeah, that was very good. 
[01:45:00]  You remember it.  I remember those songs.  All right.  Let me talk to Pete Radovich.  Pete!  Guys, he's not telling you everything.  He's married to a former model.  Oh.  Hi, Pete.  Oh, Pete Radovich.  Yeah.  Wow, look at this.  Which model?  Small world, but I just interviewed Jim at his home a couple weeks ago for a piece.  He did?  So he's been a Saturday with his family.  Ah.  Any model we would know?  No.  I don't think so, but Jim can tell you more.  Yeah, you can see his face.  He really wants to tell us now.  No, you know what the good thing about Jim Craig is? 
[01:45:30]  You can tell, no matter how hot his wife is, that she's got a good heart.  She can talk and everything, like my wife.  Like, this isn't some guy that would just marry, like, a model.  He could have.  Yeah, he could have, but he's, you know, look at him.  At the pick of the litter back then.  Wearing an All-State shirt.  The guy obviously knows what the hell he's doing in life.  It's all about the All-State.  Yes, Pete.  Yeah.  Just so you know, this guy makes some coin, too.  He lives in a beautiful home and a beautiful neighbor, and he's a very successful businessman.  Gee, glad you can rat him out here, Pete. 
[01:46:00]  You know, I saw him prancing in women's underwear one night.  All right, Pete.  Thank you.  I heard he won a gold medal.  Dave, what's up?  Hey, Jim.  How you doing?  Glad to talk to you.  I coach youth hockey in New Jersey, and every time we go up to Lake Placid for a tournament,  they always have those K&M tournaments.  I walk into that AD rink, man, and I just get chills down my spine.  So there's gold in there.  I'm sorry?  Nothing.  Continue.  Good one, Ant.  But you're trying to explain to these kids, and they just don't understand because they're 
[01:46:30]  only 11 and 12.  You've got to make them understand!  That's your job as a coach!  What kind of coach are you?  Say, come on!  It's Jim Crank for crying out loud!  It was a special comment.  I just wanted to thank you and everybody.  Jim, good career move, getting on radio and not talking.  I can't get any word.  I'm going to go take a leak in the J. Morshweat.  Hold on.  Peter, what's up?  What's going on, boys?  How you doing, Jim?  Good. 
[01:47:00]  Question.  Is it true of that story about, I guess, the Russians, like, in between periods, all  Harbrook said to you guys, like, if you lose this game, you're going to take it to  your effing grave.  Your effing grave.  Is that true?  Wow.  Did he really say that?  Yeah.  I want to thank Allstate for having the team reunion back before the NHL All-Star Game,  the Legends.  But more than that, coming back to New York City, do a clinic, going to Washington, going  to Chicago, and Philadelphia, and all those places, we're going to help the charities  of the local sports teams.  So in Philadelphia, we're going to help the Flyers charity, and New York City, we're going 
[01:47:30]  to help that, and we're going to try to help out the firefighters and things.  So it's a really good cause, but more than anything, we'd like to thank the fans for  supporting us and New York City for the great things they've done after this strategy.  And thanks a lot for having me on.  You guys had a lot of fun.  No problem, man.  Thank you.  Hey, could you give me a quote for a Pathfinder?  How much money would that cost to insure?  Allstate.  Really?  All I know is you have really good hands.  It's the great Jim Craig, everybody.  Oh, yes, Jim Craig, thank you. 
[01:48:00]  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  What do you do here?  Look, look, look at breasts.  If I wasn't on this show, I'd be out there with a wow sticker just crawling for breasts.  I see you, Carver!  Oh, yeah.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  I want to thank Jim Craig for stopping by today.  That was a nice surprise.  Oh, yeah.  A couple phone numbers in the New York area.  877-692-1027. 
[01:48:30]  Anywhere else, 866-277-4WOW.  That's 866-277-4WOW if you're outside the New York area.  Danielle, what's going on?  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  I was just calling about the contest you guys were having on Friday.  Friday we're doing, what the hell is that?  Yeah, we're looking for more people to come down here.  We've got a group of doctors that will diagnose you.  More helping, Opie.  We're doing more helping.  God, we will.  Yeah.  And Friday we finally find out what Twato is. 
[01:49:00]  Yep.  Twato?  Yeah, the growth on Sandy King.  Ah.  Yeah.  That is near her.  You know what?  That's why we call it Twato.  I see.  So what's wrong with you, Danielle?  Well, under my left breast I have what I guess, well, I've named it a third nipple.  I've never actually had it checked out.  Where exactly is it on your body?  Right underneath.  If you were to lift up my left breast, it's like right underneath it.  It's like basically on my chest and on my boob.  Oh, right where it connects.  Yeah. 
[01:49:30]  And does it look like a nip?  Kind of.  It looks like a male's one or a little kid's one.  Does it have an areoli around it?  Yeah, it would look like one.  It's not a pimple that went awry.  Well, if it went awry, it's been there for quite a few years.  She's got a third nip.  You're like a little doggy woman.  Yeah.  Wine of nip down you.  Would you like to come down and show us and have the doctors take a look?  Yeah, that would be great.  All right.  Hold on the line, okay?  Okay, thanks.  Danielle will be joining us for What the Hell is That?  Yes.  Give her directions because this is a great thing. 
[01:50:00]  We've got some fine people lined up.  Oh, just some, just a little curiosities like that there, the third nipple.  Other ones, sheer disgust.  Cauliflower balloon knot.  Cauliflower balloon knot.  We have a girl showing up who has cauliflower balloon knot.  You know what cauliflower ear looks like?  She has cauliflower rear.  It's just right there.  It's like cauliflower surrounding her balloon knot.  And the doctor's going to tell her, maybe give her a little diagnoses.  And then we've got the guy that sweats on only half his face. 
[01:50:30]  Half his face.  This is odd.  He sweats on one side of his face when he exercises.  And then he sweats on the other side of his face when he eats things like hot wings.  And the other side's completely dry.  It's a freak show of medical anomalies on Friday.  Jay, I must say.  Jay Moore back in the studio.  A lot of people saying that you sound out of your effing mind today on our show.  Well, that's what it's all about, man.  You're just excited to see us, right?  I've seen you guys in so long. 
[01:51:00]  It's been a while, yeah.  It's been a long time.  Last time I was in here, I was, you know, ready to put a shiv in someone.  And all of a sudden, now it's like happy times again.  Hey, you're threatening me.  Now, everything's fine.  Oh, I forgot about that.  That's the last time I was here.  You guys thought it was all again.  Don't threaten me.  Everything's fine.  Me and the Dice Man, he's the king of comedy.  Everything's great.  All right, Bill, what's going on?  How you doing?  Good.  Now you're making fun to me.  You want some information about Ziggy?  Info about Ziggy, sure.  I moved into my block in the village in 79. 
[01:51:30]  Yeah.  And he was there, already homeless.  In 79?  This guy's a career homeless guy.  Yep.  He's been in the army.  Yeah.  And you guys know that he was a folky from the 60s, right?  A what?  A folky.  A folk singer.  I don't know the kind of playing.  He was a folk singer?  Ah, hence the Silent Night rendition where he actually goes, oh.  Did he pen Puff the Magic Dragon?  I've heard that.  I do know that he...  The only folk song I know, isn't it? 
[01:52:00]  I know.  It was actually Herman's Hermits and Ziggy.  He is, but he does receive royalty checks from songs that he wrote.  Stop it.  Seriously.  Stop it.  To what?  To the mail of a garbage pan?  Anthony, I'm telling you.  Name one song.  I don't know the names of the songs, but his brother used to collect the checks.  His brother used to come and clean them up.  Well, you tell us what song that Ziggy wrote.  His real name's Bobby.  I hear it's from that financial firm.  Maryland, Pierce, veteran, Ziggy. 
[01:52:30]  They're Ralph.  All right, Bill.  Thanks for the impact.  You're welcome.  Homeless shopping spree, too, Jay.  Tuesday.  Yeah.  I am pumped up for homeless shopping.  You know what?  I might go homeless just to be a part of the...  Just to be part of it.  We just met a new homeless guy today.  Shut up.  Adam at Governors in Levittown Thursday through Sunday.  All right.  Jay Moore at Rascal's this weekend with the earphones on his eyes.  Mutual admiration plugging.  You do have the earphones on your eyes.  I'm a pilot.  You look like you're ready to box or something.  I'm LeVar Burton.  You look like Buddy Hackett in a mad, mad, mad world. 
[01:53:00]  Oh, there'll be a Nagasaki where the women chew the backy and the men say woo.  Wacky woo.  Jim, Buddy Hackett's a man.  I'm not...  I have no ending for Larry Merchant, so cut me off.  Are you having a deja vu back to, like, Stephen Baldwin, Anthony?  No, no, not that wacky.  It's not that bad yet in here?  You ever hang out with Stephen Baldwin?  Yeah, it's a party.  He's out of his mind.  Yeah.  He's, like, insane.  He's, like, really crazy.  People ask me, what are the Baldwins like?  Look, whenever you see the Baldwins out, it's just a party.  Just get in that circle somehow. 
[01:53:30]  You will have a good time.  Lots of chicks.  Yeah?  Yeah.  They're the Baldwins.  They're the Baldwins.  I wanted to tell Jay about Tippy Tom.  Ah, Tippy Tom.  Oh, the new homeless guy?  Yeah.  He's a gay guy.  Of course.  He used to hustle.  He goes, you don't like...  You guys don't like queers, huh?  Ah, he goes, I'm a queer.  I'm a faggot.  That's cool.  We don't care.  No, he actually said, I hope that doesn't impede our relationship.  No, come on in.  He used to hustle on the streets.  He used that word, hustle.  Hustle. 
[01:54:00]  That's like the...  He's a hustler.  Huh?  The 70s days.  The old chicken hawks.  Yeah, they would call him hustling.  I'm Mike DiNicola at Rascals on Friday.  Oh, wow.  Am I?  Look at that.  Easy.  Yeah.  How many spots do you have to cancel?  There were, like, TV movies made about that back then, where the guy would run away from  home and...  I'm a chicken hawk.  I'm a chicken.  You'd go to New York City, blonde hair, and end up sucking on it to get by.  So you'd have a bus station.  Yeah.  You know, that's got to be the worst you feel about yourself. 
[01:54:30]  It's bad enough you're homeless, but the fact that you sold your ass to make a living,  you know, it just got cheese on a little bit.  Ah.  Well, you sleep in the street, Anthony.  Sell that ass.  But you can't really sell a homeless ass.  No.  Maybe to armor all tires.  What's to buy the ass?  Well, if you want to armor all tires or something, it doesn't matter what the ass is like.  It was pre-AIDS then, you know.  It was different.  Yeah, it was a different time.  It was no AIDS no more.  That's over.  Come on.  It's that with NyQuil.  Big media thing.  She's from Minnesota.  What could she have?  Your father's a dentist for crying out loud.  Hey, let's go to Bob. 
[01:55:00]  Bob, what's up?  Bob.  Hey, now you've got Jay Moore in the studio.  Remember all the rumors about Regis not coming back next year on Millionaire?  Yeah.  Maybe Jay Moore's going to be the new host of Young Comedian.  Oh, Regis did say they're looking for a comedian.  They don't think I'm funny.  He did say that.  Really?  Yeah, because Millionaire's ratings are kind of tanking.  I think it's because he doesn't plan for his show.  He doesn't prep every day.  So he wings it?  And that seems to be the problem.  Is Regis winging it in?  I wing it on a daily basis. 
[01:55:30]  Screw Oedipus.  Three little pigs.  I'm doing what I want.  Three little pigs, you're sure?  Okay.  Kelly Ripper and me, we wing it on a daily basis.  God, how hot is Kelly Ripper?  I mean, let's start pulling.  And now that she dropped that kid, oh, my gosh.  Did you see her in that soap opera, man?  She's beautiful.  It is so awfully bad.  It's great.  I like the old 80s pictures of her in the soap opera, too, when she was, like, in her early teens.  The leg warmers.  Oh, she was cute.  She had leg warmers on?  Oh, yeah.  She shot her with leg warmers on.  With the spiky, big 80s hand.  I downloaded it.  She pulled up in a Buick Regal. 
[01:56:00]  Leave me alone.  Get away.  She looked like she was in one of the dance scenes in a Pat Benatar video.  The spiky.  Hell is for children.  Leave me alone.  Get away.  I look so good in safety pins and rubber.  I have not heard anything about Millionaire, to answer your question, but the only ABC  thing that's coming down the pipe for me would probably be hosting some type of an award  show.  Oh, really?  Oh, oh, oh.  What award shows run on ABC?  I don't even know if they have any, but when I did my overall deal, I had to pre-negotiate 
[01:56:30]  what I would get paid.  Oh.  The Obies?  I hope it's the Black Image Awards.  Just like wearing a purple suit.  Look at me with an Obie joke.  The Source Awards.  Bring your own gun.  Oh, yes.  Thanks a lot.  Yeah, good.  Buck, buck, buck into the crowd.  Hold on.  Bob had something about, you're pissed off about Geraldo, too, Bob?  Me?  That's why I said that you called.  No, Mike.  That's not.  Mike above him.  You got double vision there, Rob? 
[01:57:00]  What are you, Billy Ball?  Oh, wait.  Mike's above you, Bob.  Sorry.  Okay.  Hey, you guys rock.  Thanks.  All right.  You're right, Anthony.  I went to the wrong call there.  It worked out, though.  Mike, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How's it going?  Hey.  Hey, I was watching Fox News a couple of minutes ago, and that skank bag Geraldo Rivera  is on there trying to act like a real journalist, and I freaking hate him.  You know that he's not even close to the action?  He's sitting with tanks, okay?  He wakes these poor Afghani guys up in the middle of the night.  He's like, we're here with these fighters.  They're valiant warriors. 
[01:57:30]  Here, shine the light on them over, guys.  The camera pans over.  The guy wakes up.  He looks like he's going to grab his gun and shoot them.  He should.  Oh, God.  I'm only hoping.  He's packing heat, you know.  Oh, Jesus.  We saw Geraldo, and he's wearing, I swear to God, it's like he's wearing a cowboy hat.  There's no other way to put it.  He is in Afghanistan with a cowboy hat on, and I do believe I saw a sidearm on Geraldo.  Was he wearing the sidearm this time?  Like, I'm Geraldo, and I'm armed. 
[01:58:00]  Look out, Taliban.  I'm coming for you, Osama, with my cowboy hat.  But they won't let him close to the action.  He is so far away.  I hear that the military...  Hold on, hold on.  The military has pretty much put him off limits because of his left-leaning politics.  Where's Dan Rather?  Is Dan Rather down in it?  No, Dan ain't going anywhere.  They can't get a respirator that works in that heat.  Dan, what the hell is he going to do?  But he is in Afghanistan, Dan.  No, where is he?  Anthony's winter.  He is, I'm telling you.  What, it's winter over there? 
[01:58:30]  It's snowing there.  He did an exclusive interview with Larry King last night.  Anthony.  From Afghanistan.  Oh, yeah, he's in Afghanistan.  What part of Afghanistan?  He's barely in the action, too.  He's barely over the border.  This guy's funny.  He's in an Afghani restaurant in Midtown.  He is.  Hey, you know what?  Dan Rather was a Marine, and you know what?  Say what you want about Geraldo and Dan Rather.  They're there.  You know something?  I would go in a second, Jaymore.  I would, too.  I'd go there with a cue ball and a sweat sock and knock people out.  They don't pay us to go over there.  They won't foot the bill. 
[01:59:00]  You want to broadcast from Afghanistan?  Oh, I'd go.  With that rock.  And you know what?  The wacky over in heaven.  Hey, we're here.  I'd buy from the caves.  Guess what's in my camel.  All right.  Come on.  All right.  That was good, though.  I tried.  No, you were good, man.  What about the American that's fighting for the Taliban?  Yeah, that guy.  His father wants to what?  Yeah, this guy.  He goes, he needs a swift kick in the behind.  Yeah, with an axe.  Right.  Exactly.  It's like he played hooky from school. 
[01:59:30]  He needs a swift kick in the behind for what he has done.  That'll get him.  You know, he was always a little bit troublesome, that child.  No, he picked up arms against the United States government for a foreign power.  I think it's more than a kick in the pants.  You know what's going to happen?  He will get a kick in the pants after he's shot by a firing squad.  Thank you.  The guy should be tied to a pole and shot for treason.  High treason.  The question.  He prefaces with, I'd like to give him a big hug. 
[02:00:00]  Yeah, he said a hug.  And then a big kick in the hand.  You know how to hug that smelly camel after the kid?  You see him, and he's playing the part.  He's got the big beard.  He looks like John Krakauer's Into the Wild, that kid in that book, Into the Wild.  Right.  That is a good reference.  Yeah, I'm smart.  I'm not dumb.  He does, but new Charlie Manson.  That was a good book, too.  It was a great book.  Into the Wild.  Better than Into Thin Air, I thought.  Actually, doesn't he resemble that kid that, what was he?  He was on Friends.  He played, I think, Chandler's roommate for a while.  And he was in that other movie, Saving Private Ryan. 
[02:00:30]  He got stabbed by the big Nazi upstairs.  Doesn't he look like him?  No, that's Davy Jones and the drug years.  Davy Jones and other things.  It's like Captain Caveman.  Help us, Cavey.  Captain.  I like it, though.  They were leading him around with his arms tied behind his back.  You know, they beat the crap out of him.  And then he said he was being questioned by some American CIA agents.  Meanwhile, the CIA agent that died in that prison uprising was probably a friend of these guys. 
[02:01:00]  And now they've got to talk to this snot-nosed 20-year-old that decided it was a good idea to start shooting at Americans.  You know what his father's going to say to him?  You couldn't pierce your lip, could you?  Right, exactly.  Boy, that's true, man.  You had to join the Taliban.  Why can't you get a tattoo?  No tattoos, no piercings.  You couldn't even be gay.  You're grounded, mister.  Just don't tell me he's gay.  I don't mind if he's fighting for the Taliban.  Make sure he's not gay, nor...  If you're going home and getting crap from your parents for a piercing or a tattoo or anything, 
[02:01:30]  you're 20, 21 years old, just buy today's issue of the New York Post.  And it's right on the front page.  Just slap this in front of your pants and go, huh?  At least I'm not smoky.  Am I bad?  At least I'm not smoky.  Is this bad?  Look at Smokey.  He looks like Ziggy.  He looks like Ziggy when he wrote the music.  Now you let the cat out of the bag.  This guy is going to be on a homeless shopping spree.  Can we all kick the crap out of him?  They're not washing him at all.  Adam, what's going on?  Hi, how are you guys doing?  Hey.  I have a friend from college who can squeeze the top of his eye by his eyebrow, 
[02:02:00]  and the toothpaste-type-looking paste comes out.  It smells like cheese.  What is he, Rich Wallace?  Are you bringing him down Friday?  Yeah, I want to, but he lives in Blasso.  I hope he's listening now.  His name's Jay.  Wait, wait.  Where does it come out of?  Right above his eyebrow.  Above his eyebrow?  Up here?  Yeah, and it's real thin.  It doesn't look like toothpaste.  It looks like about minuscule toothpaste.  You were high and he had a zit. 
[02:02:30]  Oh, well, that's true, but I'm telling you, it's unbelievable.  Wow.  How much of it comes out?  If Rich Wallace comes out of his nose.  Like on his finger tip, you can get like a good amount.  Well, if you can get him down here for Friday's show, we'd love to have him.  Can it be used for anything?  Spackling, Garden State, Frickface, and Stucco?  What?  What?  It looks like cock.  Oh, cock.  Cock.  Right.  Right, right.  It looks like cock.  No, he's from Michigan.  Cock.  Well, up in Boston, they say cock.  Excuse me, where's your cock? 
[02:03:00]  Yeah, I need to cock my bath tub.  That's what I like about Home Depot.  You get a cock, a hoe, and some grass.  Right.  What time should I bring him down?  After lunch.  Anytime Friday.  During the show.  Right.  After lunch.  Adam Ferrara, Governor's in Levittown.  Can I give the ending to Ocean's Eleven?  Oh, no.  Who cares?  Are you in or out?  Right now.  Right now.  He's out.  I like George Clooney.  I think, what's that face?  He's going to wreck that. 
[02:03:30]  Julia Roberts?  Yeah.  Why do they got to put, from the producer or the creator, whatever, Aaron Brockovich.  Have they got to throw her in there?  You know, it seems to me like it's going to be.  I never even read for that part.  It might be some kind of a cool kind of guy, I don't know, crime movie.  Is that what I'm getting at?  Right.  I know.  It's a remake.  But I never saw the original.  I don't know what to talk about.  It's awful.  It's just they're all drunk and hungover posing.  Norman Fell has, like, close-ups.  Come on.  In the original.  Mr. Roper's in it.  Well, you don't need Julia Roberts. 
[02:04:00]  Who would you like instead?  Whoring it up.  I just don't like her.  I don't like her at all.  Really?  I don't like her in any movies.  Oh, my God.  I'd like the venue.  I love her.  I love her.  Love her.  I love her, too.  Now, Jay Moore, you're a movie star.  Really?  What do you think?  I think that might have gone away a while ago.  Yeah, you are.  You're a weirdo.  I got an effing talk show on cable.  Wow.  Jay Moore's a movie star and an Allstate representative.  You listened to the last segment.  No doubt.  Jim Craig.  www.jimcraigusa.com. 
[02:04:30]  That is his website.  That's right.  Well done.  Hey, man, thank you.  You're finally down here in New Orleans.  Yeah.  Are you calling from there?  Yeah, I just moved out about six months ago.  You have no idea how desolate radio is down here.  In Ireland.  We just started yesterday.  Fantastic.  I just stumbled across it.  I'm so happy.  We're coming down for Mardi Gras and the Super Bowl.  Oh, hook you up.  Give me a call when you guys are coming down.  Oh, of course.  Sure thing.  I think everyone knows when those two events happen, right? 
[02:05:00]  Mardi Gras and the Super Bowl?  Yeah.  Yeah, we're all digging trenches out here.  Why is that?  Who wants to have Mardi Gras and the Super Bowl down here?  It's going to be insane.  Yeah.  I think it's a great place for the Super Bowl.  It's a good party town, but security is horrible down here.  Well, they're putting the Secret Service in charge of security for the Super Bowl.  Right on.  The Secret Service, man.  Did I hear Jay Moore say he wants to go to Afghanistan?  We all do.  We're trying to do our show from there.  Actually, I hooked up with the gumbo crew.  They're down at Ground Zero serving the rescue workers.  We're taking the gumbo crew over to Afghanistan to field see the soldiers. 
[02:05:30]  I don't want to get there by gunboat.  Gumbo.  That might take a couple weeks.  Gumbo.  Gumbo.  Gumbo.  Gumbo.  Gumbo.  Gumbo.  Gumbo.  Gumbo.  Gumbo.  Gumbo.  Like soup.  What's a gumbo crew?  The gumbo crew is down at Ground Zero.  Yeah, they make gumbo crew down there in Nolens.  Oh, that's awesome.  And then they take it down and feed the people.  When you guys are going, how are you getting to Afghanistan?  Flying?  We're going to try to fly over.  No, Joe, we're going to swim.  I'm saying.  How are we getting it? 
[02:06:00]  We use enough frequent fly-a-mile.  No, I'm saying, like, is it, like, sponsored by the government?  Are you guys going to find your way?  Because I don't think you can go to the counter and go, yeah, Afghanistan, around 50s.  A couple of old, please?  A couple of old, please.  We've been hooking up a lot of corporations and getting funding for it.  Wow.  Take a little private plane over there.  I'd like to take me a B-52 or something.  Yeah, I'm not taking it.  If I'm going, I'm going in the B-52 with a stallion helicopter off the deck of a ship  because I'm not getting shot down in a Leah's plane.  Oh, God.  Imagine if you're taking some private plane, man.  And they're like, what is that? 
[02:06:30]  Death from above!  You're sitting there getting a Hummer and you're like, nice seat, up 20,000 feet, and a missile hit you.  You're getting a Hummer on a plane.  What airline do you fly?  I'm saying if it was a private jet.  I can't even get a second bag of nuts.  Just the private plane.  All right, well, thanks.  If you get corporate funding for a private plane, I don't want to take a private plane.  You need guns on it.  I don't want some, you know, just a pilot, like, yeah, this is our numbers and we're coming in.  Yeah.  I'd rather have a couple missiles attached, like, hey, we're coming in. 
[02:07:00]  Exactly.  Aye, aye, good!  Chris, what's going on?  Here we come!  Hey, you guys are making plans to go to Afghanistan?  Yeah, why?  I thought you guys were going to plan the show.  Jason, I'm going to make a call.  We don't plan anything.  Oh, didn't we?  That's what's going to be good.  Where's Lynch today?  Is that going to be a show tonight?  Wow, everyone's talking at the same time.  You know what?  It's my fault.  I got a migraine.  It's my fault.  Who wants to say something?  Chris?  I just wanted to know, isn't Lynch supposed to be coming in?  Isn't he doing a show in New York tonight?  I don't know.  Lynch is at Gotham.  You're not sure.  All right, I just wanted to know.  I think he's at Gotham. 
[02:07:30]  I think it is.  All right.  Pointing comments that aren't even here.  That's great.  Hobi, I'm a little pumped up, and I'm sorry for...  Don't worry about it.  I like your Hot Wheels shirt.  You're all right.  I went from looking like a bum, now you like my shirt and my corduroy pants.  Where'd you get the Hot Wheels Racing t-shirt?  I'd wear that.  I'm a player, man.  I got it like that.  You see the Atari shirts yet?  No.  People walking out of the Atari shirts.  Yeah, but that's like what every skateboarder is going to do.  That's my computer.  Yeah.  2,600?  2,600 apples?  Yeah.  Hey, Gene.  Gene, what's up?  Yo.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:08:00]  It says I'm just mad for no reason.  I just want to vent.  What's the problem?  Yeah, listen to this.  You guys there?  Yeah.  All right, I can't hear you.  Okay.  Look, I'm just furious, man.  I live in Jersey, right?  Yeah.  And I just...  Basically, I told Stinky, man.  I said, look, I don't have much to say.  I'm just mad.  I'm mad.  I have my girlfriend.  I just left.  I'm on my way to school.  I go to school at night.  I work all day.  I'm mad.  I get no appreciation from nobody.  I'm mad.  Are you mad?  I actually live in New York with the attitude I have.  I'm so pissed.  You're pissed off at nothing? 
[02:08:30]  Yeah, what's...  There's got to be a reason you're this mad.  Oh, no.  Well, there is.  There's plenty of reasons.  Is it the road rage?  Is it the girlfriend?  No, the chick not giving you the sex?  What's up?  Oh, no.  I get plenty of that, man.  That's taken care of.  You should be mad, then.  You know what, sir?  If you're angry, just get someone to insult you and then punch him in the face.  That's what I want.  I need that right now.  You should suck.  Just bump into him a couple times.  You know what makes me happy, though?  When I hear Norton on the show.  Well, Norton's not here today.  Well, you're going to be really pissed today.  Yeah, I am.  I'm going to punch right through this windshield.  Wow, dude.  I'm so mad. 
[02:09:00]  I'll throw a bucket of AIDS on you, blech.  Huh?  I'll throw a bucket of AIDS on you, blech.  Gene, is this going to be your bit?  You're going to be like the mad guy and just call up and say you're mad?  Is that how you're trying to get on the show?  Yeah, every time.  Look, I'll call you guys every day.  I'm severely pissed off.  I will tell you everything.  I will make you guys...  When you're telling these little stories,  here's a good idea.  Have a point.  It makes it so much more interesting for the listener.  Yeah, I know.  Do you hate black people?  Do you hate the blacks?  Do you hate the blacks?  No. 
[02:09:30]  No, I got plenty of black friends.  So you're not even angry at it, like...  You're just mad?  Direct your rage, jackass.  Come on, now.  I'm going to direct it to you in a minute.  Good.  That was Mike DiNicola.  That's fine.  You've got crazy eyes.  Help yourself.  He's just mad.  All right, Gene.  You're the mad guy.  I understand.  Call him back.  Call back at the mad guy.  I don't think you're mad enough.  I don't really believe you're that mad.  Listen, you can't even talk, you stuttering prick.  Yeah, I did.  Yeah, I said you prick.  Yeah, okay.  The show needed a new character.  A new character. 
[02:10:00]  So it's mad guy.  It's Gene the mad guy.  Gene the mad guy's on the phone.  Gene the mad guy.  You want to sound funny?  This guy asked me to christen this kid.  Yeah, seven grand I charge you, prick.  Let me ask you something.  Who is Jay Moore?  I don't even know him.  I'm right here.  What do you want to know?  Look at Gene the mad guy.  You sound lousy.  Where are you from?  I sound what?  He's a Jersey kid.  He's a Jersey like you.  Oh, jeez.  That's an insult.  Hey, I grew up in Verona, by the way.  State football champions, Monty.  So count that on your way to work and your Chevy celebrity. 
[02:10:30]  Oh, yeah.  No, I'm actually in a Chevy van.  I have a real job.  You got a date-rate mobile with your little van?  All right.  Gene the mad guy.  Comedy's not easy, is it, Gene?  No.  What?  It's Gene the mad guy.  Gene the mad guy.  By our brand-new character.  I promise you that...  There.  See, now he needs to prepare.  Yeah.  He's the mad guy.  How could you be accused of preparing when you go to the wrong damn phone call?  I mean, did you plan that?  Are you that diabolical?  You plan when you make a mistake? 
[02:11:00]  The problem is we don't plan, is what they're saying.  Oh.  Well, that's why it's so spontaneous in the context.  That's why I went to the wrong call, because I was winging it.  Because the comedy gods smile on the show.  There you go.  The oldie and Anthony Show.  Hey, I'm playing the most erratic part of a woman.  It's the boobies.  Hey, we're back with the O&A Show.  Hey.  A lot of the faithful listeners, they want to be characters on the show now, Anthony. 
[02:11:30]  You're all jealous of...  Angry.  ...med...  ...med...  I forgot how.  Huh?  Bed cow.  Bed cow?  Yeah, well, it was angry, angry Gene.  Angry Gene?  He's just angry.  He's actually recessive Gene.  That was Gene Okerlund.  And now I'm getting word from somebody on Instant Feedback.  He says he wants to be slightly pissed off Instant Feedback guy.  I don't think that's a character that could translate well. 
[02:12:00]  How about this one?  How about this one?  I want to be...  Everything's pretty good.  Everything's pretty good, guys.  Everything's pretty good, guys.  I heard you had cancer.  Yeah, but we're calling it Ireland.  Everything's pretty good.  It's not funny at all.  Never mind.  It is funny.  Larry Merchant, even less funny.  It's funny to someone.  Hey, hey, is that Earl?  Yeah, we got to get an Earl.  Oh, thank God.  Have you heard about Earl?  Jay, we got to give you all the updates.  You told me on the phone yesterday.  Oh, okay.  Earl almost...  Did anybody get a photo of his black ass in the gown? 
[02:12:30]  No.  Not yet.  Earl almost bled to death on us.  Earl's a kind of a...  Earl.  Earl, bleeding ulcer.  Wonder why.  Jeez.  Who knew?  Yikes.  Earl.  Yo.  Still in ICU.  What's going on, bro?  Um, laughing my ass off.  Are you on opiates?  Why?  What show are you listening to?  Methane?  I'm listening to you guys.  Oh.  Earl, are you on morphine?  I'm on nothing.  What?  They don't have you on drugs?  No bed? 
[02:13:00]  Earl, you're in ICU still, right?  Yes.  Now, when the nurse comes around with the medicine and gives it to everybody else, she just skips  you.  Yes.  Can't you just do Regan's bit and start moaning louder?  Oh!  Oh!  So the idea is to get out of this unit.  You want your medicine?  You too!  Earl.  When you take your medicine.  Did you have an operation?  No, they...  Basically, what they're doing now is they started feeding me liquid to make sure that I'm still 
[02:13:30]  not bleeding.  Ah, okay.  And they're pumping you full of new blood.  By liquid, you mean IV?  I'm about to get some of them in an hour.  I figured it out.  Almost bled to death, so they went in with a camera, decided they didn't have to operate,  and now they're just waiting to make sure he's not bleeding anymore.  Does Earl think ICU is a college?  I know.  Yeah, I went to ICU.  Earl, why are you still...  Have you asked your doctor...  Did you judge your doctor?  About why you're still in the intensive care unit? 
[02:14:00]  So, what's wrong are you, Anthony?  Because they're still not sure if I'm bleeding internally.  Oh, okay.  So, they want everything ready just in case you go into some kind of a shock or something.  Yes.  Are you in any pain?  Not at all.  I'm just...  Around 1 o'clock, I got a Walkman finally, and started listening to the radio.  I was just bored out of my mind.  What?  They don't have TVs in there?  Nothing.  ICU?  Because of all the monitor hookups in here, you can't have nothing.  You got the heart thing going? 
[02:14:30]  Beep, beep, beep, beep next to you?  Yep.  Can we hear it?  Put the phone by it.  Well, not really.  I mean, if I was close to the guy next to me, you might even be able to hear that.  Yeah, what's wrong with the guy next to you?  Yeah.  That's always fun.  Oh, God.  What does he have?  He has...  He's...  The person across from me, flat-lined.  Oh, no.  That's always fun.  Get his medicine.  And I couldn't help but watch.  Yeah, you watched.  What did he have or do or...  Did you talk to yourself?  I don't know, but he's...  There are just people in here that... 
[02:15:00]  Earl, Earl, you want to laugh?  Switch the charts.  Is he dead?  Barely.  Barely a laugh.  What?  Are you flat-lined?  They came in and shocked him?  Yeah.  You got to see on them...  Bring him back to life?  Yep.  Nice.  Wow.  Homers don't die.  That rocks.  You know, even flat-lined, he had more energy than Earl does at a sticker stop.  Oh, go screw.  He's bleeding again.  Right.  Earl, yesterday you said that you were on the road to recovery.  And one of the listeners said, is Earl going to get lost on the road to recovery? 
[02:15:30]  And I told him to go.  Right.  Oh, you did hear that one yesterday.  Go F.  What about the guy next to you now?  What does he have?  Oh, he looks pretty bad.  What does he got?  Earl, do you talk to anybody in the room?  No.  I mean, everyone here is...  Do they know you're a patient or just some guy?  Is he ready that everyone else is just, like, ready to die?  Yes.  So you can't even make conversation? 
[02:16:00]  No.  That's how they put you there.  They thought you were dead.  Hi.  It's like, holy ass, this one's going to survive.  What do we do?  Oh, my God.  Earl, you sure you're not in the morgue downstairs and they just...  No, that was the emergency room Monday night.  Is it true the guy that flatlined right before he flatlined said, geez, there goes the ICU?  Ah, cloud session.  I was wondering. 
[02:16:30]  Earl, are you with us?  Earl.  Earl.  Earl.  Earl.  Jesus Christ.  Don't do that, Earl.  Oh, please.  That was scary.  That was scary.  Earl, he's back.  I'm fine.  There he is.  You poor bastard, man.  I've seen a white light.  Hey, Earl, has anyone come to visit you?  My parents came last night.  Your parents?  Yeah.  Hey, we had Vernon Reed on the show yesterday.  He was all concerned.  He called me and I'll wait.  Did you guys bust his trap?  No, he said that his sister told him that you were in the hospital and I asked him, is 
[02:17:00]  it his sister or just his sister?  Oh, because his sister loves the show.  Yeah, I know.  We were singing the one, uh, couple, uh, black, living color song we knew.  Yeah, a couple of personalities.  Come on, open letter to a landlord?  That's great.  Those guys disappeared faster than a Tom Arnold show.  What the hell happened in living color?  Vernon Reed's always in the mix, don't get me wrong.  Yeah.  The Glover kid was in Platoon.  Right.  Someone took the H1 gig.  Yeah, someone took the, no, that was the kid from Platoon, took the VH1 gig, and then 
[02:17:30]  the rest of them, uh, Earl.  Well, they're actually back together.  Hey, Earl, it doesn't sound like, it doesn't sound like you have much for us today.  Are they going to move you to a regular room soon?  Yeah, when are you at ICU?  Um, I should know within the hour because I just had a blood test.  Do they want to know?  What's my blood count?  Did you have any?  It's a blood test.  Once the blood count is up, I'm mad at you.  All right, Earl.  Listen, Shrek, do you, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't,  what I want to know is what you're doing in an intensive care unit to see if you're still  bleeding internally, and yet you still don't have any painkillers, or just vague. 
[02:18:00]  He's not any pain.  He always has to.  Always vague, Earl.  Earl's the kind of guy who would turn it down.  He's that jackass.  You want extra, the guy who wants you to turn it down.  What am I going to say?  They haven't given me anything.  Say, where's my morphine?  I'm bleeding to death, you, what?  Say, ow, I hurt.  I, I, you know, the, the, the, the, the, the idea is to get out of this unit.  Ask for a sponge bath from a nurse.  Yeah, get out of it.  Well, actually, I got that this morning.  You got the sponge bath?  From, um, it was a, uh, an Asian man and woman, and I was, 
[02:18:30]  how the woman did the best.  A husband and wife team.  I see.  Happy ending.  This is what happens when, this is how, this is what happens when you wing a radio show.  Right.  You got, you got to work around, and you finally hit.  We got it.  Wait a minute, bro.  We got it.  We got a sponge bath by an Asian man.  Asian man and woman.  No, the woman was inside, and the guy stood at the front.  Inside?  Wow.  What?  Frosty?  What was the guy?  Hold on.  Did they turn on your fire hose at the end?  Yankee cranky.  Let her, let her, let her, let her explain. 
[02:19:00]  The woman gave you the bath, and a guy held the video camera?  What happened, Earl?  Well, they had one guy, like, watching, because it's a curtain.  It's not a door, per se.  Right.  And the woman gave me, you know, the bath, and I was, and I was thinking of you guys.  I was thinking about asking for the happy ending, but I went, it's six o'clock in the morning.  Grab the cookie roll.  The cookie roll.  Earl, did she wash everywhere?  Did she wash your yam bag?  No, just my back.  Why is that?  I don't know.  Because bags get so smelly, right?  So they turned you over, and they sponged your back, and they went, you're on their way. 
[02:19:30]  Yeah, and then they let me finish, because I'm so alive compared to everyone else.  They say, you can finish it yourself.  You're so alive compared to, Earl, is it true?  I'm just getting this in, that the guy across from you, the flatline, is indeed Scott Muni from Q104 here in New York.  No?  Folks.  All right.  Earl, just wondering.  Did you say the woman started to wash you, and you thought of Opie and Anthony?  He did say that.  A little disconcerting.  I wasn't sure.  And what was the guy doing?  What was the Asian guy? 
[02:20:00]  Giggling.  How jealous was he?  Not in the mic.  Oh, God.  You doing okay?  The Asian curse.  Earl, who are you talking to?  Hold on, Earl, who is that?  Jay, I only have one a day, and there it was.  I just got a exam.  Who is that?  The doctor.  Put him on the phone.  Put him on the phone.  I want to talk to your doctor.  We need pot.  He's a little busy right now.  No, he isn't.  They're all dead.  They're all gomers.  Gomers don't die.  They're all machines.  Get out of my emergency room.  Gomer.  It's like cruise control. 
[02:20:30]  Yeah.  All right, so Asian guy just watched as Asian girl.  He didn't even watch?  He didn't even watch.  He just put his back there.  And just saw the little beating behind the curtain.  Oh, wash the black pack.  Yes, you wash the black pack.  Yanky cranky.  Oh, no more cow gun.  Let's go quick.  People die in here.  Use of both hands.  Use of both hands.  He jokes are really racist.  Come on, get away from me.  That's it.  Guys?  Crime to general. 
[02:21:00]  Yes, Earl.  But you guys, you've got to see it for yourself.  No.  No, I'm not in Afghanistan.  And you are on drugs.  Intensive.  Earl is the perfect example of what could happen if your kid never does drugs.  Earl, I've got to ask you.  I've got to ask you something, Earl.  You're known for your shaved head.  Is it growing into an afro now?  Yeah, do you look like Billy?  No, not really.  I mean, I'm growing a nice beard.  Oh, are you?  Yeah, that's what you need.  A black guy with a beard in this climate.  The thing is I shave every other day. 
[02:21:30]  Tomorrow's my shave day.  Uh-huh.  It's like you're in lockdown.  But you're not going to go from intensive care to being discharged.  Yeah, I'm going to a room and then probably a day after that I'm out.  That's it?  Yeah.  What was the cause of all this?  Just Opie and Anthony drive you crazy?  Yeah.  It was funny.  I was talking with my parents.  They had asked me, the docs asked me about family history.  And I said, and I didn't think I had anything.  And then my father and my father had, like, these big crossfoot eyes a little bit. 
[02:22:00]  Uh-huh.  Family history.  Did you say, well, we came over on these big boats that were crowded?  No, stop it.  No?  I didn't know how far back they wanted you to go.  Apparently on my father's side, there's been this problem.  Oh, really?  I've got to tell Jay, we feel a little guilty because Earl had an episode on our show live.  And next thing you know, he was doubled over in pain in the back.  Do we have a tape of the last time Earl was on this show where he yelled like that?  Where he was yelling and screaming?  I think you can find that because I would love to. 
[02:22:30]  He freaked out.  And Earl, I've got to apologize.  I put the final nail in his stomach coffin there.  Whatever I want to call it.  That's the name of my new band.  I'm going to destroy the Brewer.  Me and Brewer are going to go out with stomach coffin.  And then he was at his desk puking, and we thought it was because of Stalker Patty's feed.  It turned out it wasn't.  It was because of the episode in the studio.  It took Earl an hour to measure our office.  No, it did not.  Oh, Earl.  Stop it.  It did too.  Don't even start lying.  Stop lying.  Oh!  It's perforated. 
[02:23:00]  All right.  Now we got back again.  Wow.  Don't scare us like that, Earl.  It's bad if you're black.  Clear.  All right.  Earl, any other African-American gentleman in that room with you?  None at all.  Hey, Earl, ask the guy to flatline if he ever saw any of my movies.  Oh, God.  I love mafia.  Pay it forward.  Pay it forward.  Pay it forward. 
[02:23:30]  Earl's on the board with an assist.  All right, Earl.  Earl, well, take care of yourself.  Thanks for adding nothing today.  Check in with us again tomorrow.  For a guy in his deathbed, you're really dull.  He's the only guy in ICU that's like up and around.  He could get...  Earl, do you go up and go to the bathroom yourself?  Well, they give me a...  A pan?  A nice little jar.  You can't get up?  Why can't you get up and go yourself?  I'm lazy.  I'm lazy.  Earl, do you have a... 
[02:24:00]  You're shifty and lazy.  That's why.  Earl, do you have a catheter in?  No.  What do you want in this jar?  One for New York.  Did Black Earl from the future come and visit you?  Who else visit?  Earl.  Earl?  I pulled...  Earl, Earl.  Hello?  Earl.  Earl.  Earl, wake up.  God damn it, Earl.  Hang in there.  We got him.  We got him.  Earl.  Yes.  Oh, man.  Stop doing that.  Did anyone visit you besides your parents?  What about friends from the neighborhood or... 
[02:24:30]  No, not really.  I mean, because...  Not really or no?  Scott so?  I heard he called.  I heard he called.  Come by and stand over your bed and go...  I'm sure Scott doesn't want to be near an ICU.  I mean, this is the first...  They'll try to put him in a room.  I can't get the phone all day.  Yeah.  Well, Earl, thank you.  Earl, we'll check in tomorrow.  I need a nap.  Hang in there.  Oh, yes.  Earl?  Earl?  Earl?  What?  Oh, God, that's so scary.  It just shows you it can happen at any time. 
[02:25:00]  It can.  See?  All right, Earl.  Earl, just hypothetically, if you die, will you stay in the air or something you can give  to me?  Yeah.  So, legally, we don't have to go through the whole household.  The public file.  You can have the public file.  Do you have any money or assets, Earl?  Hell no.  Well, so you could just die and nothing would even...  The earth would just keep going.  The Earl fortune.  Earl, has this taught you that when you get back on your feet, you've got to get back to  society, stop being, you know, so crazy with the strippers and everything, like not giving 
[02:25:30]  up, not having a good time, go out and live life, give back to the community?  Yeah.  Black Earl, ladies and gentlemen.  There you go.  Rascals Friday.  Fill it.  Earl, Godspeed.  Hang in there.  And we'll talk to you tomorrow.  All right.  All right.  There you go, Earl.  Wow.  Dan, what's going on?  Hey, I had an idea for a new show character.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm going to be...  Hey, turn down the radio guy. 
[02:26:00]  There you go.  All right.  Turn down...  Who wants to talk to?  You or the radio?  Turn down that radio, Dan.  I can't hear you.  Ho, ho.  See, it's turn down the radio guy.  What?  Okay, wait.  I'll turn it down.  Hold on.  Hey, everyone.  It's turn down the radio guy.  Turn down the radio guy.  What's up?  Turn down the radio guy.  All right.  What a great new character we have.  Thank you.  Hey, turn that down.  Turn down the radio.  What?  Turn down your radio.  I'm talking to you.  Oh, my God. 
[02:26:30]  Ladies and gentlemen, turn down the radio guy.  Okay.  All right.  Bye, turn down the radio guy.  Okay.  Don't forget, that's a delay.  Hey, I have an idea for a new show character.  What?  Hey, turn down the radio guy.  Turn that down.  You're already on the radio.  Stop.  No, I'm not on the radio yet.  I just talked to you.  No.  I want to talk to the opening entity.  Turn down the radio guy.  I can't hear you.  Very good.  All right.  There he is.  Bye-bye.  There he is. 
[02:27:00]  What a great new character we have.  Turn down the radio guy.  Dan, the turn down the radio guy.  Wow.  Who saw that coming, Anthony?  Huh?  What an ass.  Very funny, though.  Let's play, what are we learning next?  Angry guy.  Probably even more angry.  That guy is funnier.  Yes.  You have 30 seconds to go.  You have 30 seconds to go.  Whip ball mouth.  Whip ball mouth.  Whip ball mouth.  Check this out.  I got birds to show you. 
[02:27:30]  Wow.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  I want to thank Adam Farrar for stopping by today.  He's playing Governors Thursday through Sunday.  Saturday.  Thursday, Friday, and Saturday.  Governors in Levittown.  Jay Moore playing Hofstra in like an hour or two.  Jay Moore playing Hofstra.  And then Rascals, two shows Friday.  We'll be at the Rascals show. 
[02:28:00]  Nice.  Less orange.  That means we've got to blow off Lewis Black because he's at Caroline's,  and we might have to blow off Adam Farrar who's at Governors in Levittown.  You can see this is the beautiful thing.  You're making us choose.  You're making and I choose which comedian to be on Friday.  That's the beautiful thing.  You can see an Adam Farrar on Thursday.  See me on Friday.  And then you can either see Adam again on Saturday.  Or you can go see Lewis Black on Saturday.  Or you can go see Earl.  No one's coming.  You can get tickets.  I hear the invisible man visited Earl in the hospital,  but he just couldn't see him.  But he was there.  All right. 
[02:28:30]  Anthony, some great what-do-we-learns.  And we're going to play the clip of Earl Freakin that put him over the top  and we believe got him in ICU.  Great.  Do you want to do that first?  Yeah.  Let's hear Earl right before his stomach started bleeding and he had to go to ICU.  All right.  Here we go.  The camera's all pissed at us.  Earl, yes?  Did you measure the office, Earl?  Yes.  And?  21 by 15.  Oh, it is bigger than 18.  Wow.  Okay. 
[02:29:00]  It's a nice-sized office.  Thank you, Earl.  Quick break.  It took how long?  An hour.  An hour to get two measurements.  I didn't know about that until like 20 minutes ago.  We asked to have the office measured an hour ago.  Right at the top of the show.  We got into this discussion.  I was upstairs.  It took an hour for you to measure the goddamn office, Earl.  It did not take me an hour to measure.  I didn't even know about it until 20 minutes ago.  Earl? 
[02:29:30]  I didn't know in 20 minutes ago.  Oh, my God.  He's throwing it.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  I didn't know.  I swear to God.  Wow.  Yeah, that was a...  And then soon after that, he's doubled over in pain.  And next thing you know, he's in ICU.  So...  You know, like stomach acid was just pouring into those open wounds in his stomach.  There you go.  Do the math.  All right.  It's time to play What Did We Learn on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Yeah.  Lots of good ones coming in.  Vito from Whitestone.  Today, I learned that to a homeless person, Christmas and Twister sound the same. 
[02:30:00]  It's funny.  It was there right from the beginning.  Very good.  Nice.  Mike from Jersey.  Today, I learned that even while bleeding to death, Earl is still dull.  Mike from the Bronx.  I learned the Olive Garden bumped Adam for Bob Patterson.  Uh, Danielle from Alabama.  I learned today that the juice is wackier than the big wazoo.  Yeah.  K. Wood from Yonkers.  I learned Jim Craig and Rich Voss are still making a living with material from over 20 years ago. 
[02:30:30]  Ah!  Voss wears a medal.  Him and Al Sharpton have the same medal around the necks.  That dingles a sprinkle.  I wear a medal around my neck from the Special Olympics.  I took third.  Want to buy a triad, Thor?  Anthony from West Orange.  I learned Verona won the state championship.  Brian from Philly.  I learned that black girl thinks of O&A when receiving a sponge bath from an Asian couple.  Oh!  Watch your back.  I get front.  You know, that Asian couple didn't even work for the hospital. 
[02:31:00]  Just went around with a bucket and a sponge.  Wonderful.  Sandwiches, coffee.  Do you know who got the mugugai pan?  They just wanted to see a black one.  Honey, go, I tell you, experiment.  Stories are true.  Watch the dark snake.  A duck from...  Rows like tarpaple.  Looked like the neck of a duck hanging in a window at the restaurant.  Big, wrong, and brown.  Mighty oak grown from acorn.  Sean, what's going on?  Hey, guys, I learned two things. 
[02:31:30]  I learned, first, the angry guy wasn't prepared.  Yep.  And second, queer homeless men, always funny.  Always.  Always funny.  Poo-ta-ah!  Poo-ta-ah!  That guy's my new favorite caller.  Doug from Boston.  I learned that Jingle Bell sounds a lot like Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.  Correct.  Jerry from Edison.  Today I learned that a guy with fingers like bananas promotes a company whose slogan is,  You're in good hands.  Poo-ta-ah!  And Jerry wants to be, can I be effing disgusting with pissed off jean guy? 
[02:32:00]  Poo-ta-ah!  No!  Anthony from West Orange.  Again, I learned Adam Ferrara has to go to the hospital to break up the Yankee Cranky shop.  Hey, you know what's in West Orange, New Jersey, O.P.?  Rascals.  Comedy Club called Rascals.  Right.  Yes.  They got some big doings this weekend.  There's a Jay Moore appearance.  Friday.  Rascals.  West Orange.  One-Eyed Jack, I'm Oz.  Sorry.  I learned Jay Moore likes staring at walls of naked men.  Ziggy outlived George Harrison.  Who would have guessed? 
[02:32:30]  Sometimes the truth just hurts.  He also learned O.P. likes standing in front of guys wearing tight slacks.  He learned to get involved with any Baldwin family party.  Ziggy's real name is Bob, and he's collecting residual checks.  The Comedy God Smile on O&A.  And hookers have the power to heal.  Yes.  Oh, don't they, though?  Can we just meditate on that note?  Rob from Philly.  Oh, we got that one.  Okay.  How about the Alabama?  What station are you on?  Are you on after NASCAR today, or what? 
[02:33:00]  Syndication Underground.  NASCAR.  Syndication Underground.  Nice.  Underground.  Hey, Underground's happening, baby.  What's up, Cleveland?  Right, Jay?  Cleveland loves you guys.  You got it.  Hey, Cleveland.  Cleveland's cool.  Turn it up, baby.  Cleveland.  You got the Browns, and now you got Romy, and now you got Opie and Anthony.  Your afternoons and mornings, everything's taken care of in Cleveland, entertainment-wise.  Except your weather.  Yeah, the weather you got to work on, but you know what?  I'm still down with the C-Town.  They got the flats, though.  They got the flats, Monty. 
[02:33:30]  They got the Jake.  Local reference there.  Flats.  Oh, yes.  Okay.  They got the Jake.  What's up?  No?  Good evening, gentlemen.  I have two things.  Yeah.  I learned Herbie the Love Bug is coaching the Olympic hockey team.  There you go.  You never know.  And games are better with body parts and organs on the floor.  Very good.  Yes.  I do agree with that.  Let's go to Bobby.  Bobby.  Yo, what's going on, guys?  I learned two quick things.  Yeah.  I learned don't say we'll be right back before commercials.  Yep.  And Opie and Anthony would like to wing it.  Yes, we do. 
[02:34:00]  Wing it.  Stinky rules and dice sucks.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Who rules?  Oh, oh, Stinky.  Uncle John.  What did I do to you?  Uncle John.  Hey, guys.  I learned two things tonight, too.  I learned that Jim Craig is about as exciting as Black Girl on the radio.  Oh, no.  And I learned that our homeless friend was part of Peter, Paul, and Ziggy.  Peter, Paul, and Ziggy.  Peter, Paul, and Ziggy.  Phenomenal.  Hey, well, what about the new guy?  I forgot his name already.  Tippi Tom.  Tippi Tom.  Tippi Tom?  The homeless gay guy?  Tippi Tom.  The homeless right. 
[02:34:30]  John, you like Tippi Tom?  Did you hear him earlier?  Oh, all right.  Hey, that's you.  F you.  Your mother's an animal, you son of a bitch.  Moe man.  He's going to call me an animal.  Yeah, today I learned two things also.  I learned Jay Moore smokes hippie lettuce, and I learned that he fights with a cue ball  and a sweat sock.  Hey, whatever's near you, man.  I'm my own federal marshal, baby.  There you go.  Norm, what's up?  Hey, guys.  I learned that Opie doesn't really do his pre-show work because why else would he have 
[02:35:00]  asked Jim Craig, a guy who has alcohol problems, if he wanted a beer?  Yeah, good move, Opie.  Whoops.  Hey, Jim, I noticed you're holding a big blue book.  Want a cocktail?  Very good, Norm.  Perhaps we can get one for your friend Bill.  Oh, was it?  All right, we've got to go right now.  We're ending with Tippy Tom singing Jingle Bells, our latest homeless friend out of here,  helping us with the homeless shopping spree.  Thanks to Jay Moore, Mike Dina-Cola, and of course, Adam Roth.  See you soon, Cleveland.  You want to hear Jingle Bells?  Yeah! 
[02:35:30]  Jingle Bells.  Oh, Brian, this guy rolled.  All right.  Sally Kramer?  You shall let them call me names.  Then they let poor Tippy Tom, playing all the reindeer games. 
[02:36:00]  Then one foggy Christmas Eve, Santa came to say.  They'll be with your nose so bright, that you got my sleigh tonight.  And then all the other reindeer, now you shall never call me names.  Now they're the poor Ticky, playing all the reindeer games. 
[02:36:30]  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah! </pre>
