<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts jokingly acknowledging their "shock jock" reputation before transitioning to Opie's improved sleep situation, contrasting his new apartment with previous experiences involving noisy neighbors, pests, and a homeless man urinating near his air conditioner.  He then recounted a terrifying incident in Buffalo where a man, potentially a serial rapist, entered his unlocked apartment while he was asleep, getting extremely close to his face before fleeing upon realizing Opie was male.  This led to a discussion with guest Patrice O'Neal about the likelihood of this being the same rapist and differing interpretations of the event.

The show then moved to "Whip Him Out Wednesday," a segment involving women flashing for listeners with specific stickers, with an emphasis on not harassing the women.  This segued into a discussion about CNN sports anchor Larry Smith seemingly equating dog abuse with crimes against women, sparking debate and referencing a similar situation Patrice had with John Gibson. The hosts discussed media overuse of the word "outraged," contrasting genuine outrage with minor inconveniences, and further debated the power dynamic between men and women and its impact on male spaces and freedoms.  They analyzed unusual Yahoo top searches, speculating on the reasons behind trending queries, and promoted upcoming events like a *Superbad* screening and the "What the Hell is That?" segment. Patrice O'Neal remained a guest throughout this section.

The broadcast then shifted to a debate about Michael Vick's dogfighting charges, comparing the public outrage to that surrounding the Kobe Bryant and Duke lacrosse cases.  The hosts and Patrice O'Neal debated whether animal cruelty was worse than rape, with varying opinions on the intensity of public reaction and the influence of race on media responses.  A frank discussion followed about racial dynamics in society and the media, highlighting perceived differences in how white and black communities respond to accusations against their own, referencing the Don Imus controversy.

A significant portion focused on an O.J. Simpson interview on MN1.com, with the hosts playing audio clips of prank calls made during the interview, highlighting O.J.'s apparent obliviousness to public perception.  They analyzed his continued public presence and the lack of accountability for past actions.  Chris Hansen from "To Catch a Predator" then joined the show.  A humorous segment followed, involving the hosts playing clips of allegedly sexually suggestive comments made by Hansen himself.  The conversation touched upon the show's methods, the age of decoys, and the ongoing lawsuit against the network; Hansen also promoted an upcoming Dateline episode about iPod theft.

Following Hansen's appearance, a phone call with Rich Voss ensued.  The conversation involved humorous and crude discussions about Voss's recording of his wife's C-section, including graphic descriptions of the procedure and jokes about the timing of the birth relative to his comedy career.  A subsequent conversation with Patrice O'Neal delved into their opinions on the ideal length of songs, leading to a humorous, increasingly absurd list of musical elements they disliked, focusing on excessively long songs and various rock concert clichés.

A later segment involved a long bit where the hosts and Patrice O'Neal created an extensive list of things they hated about rock concerts and live music performances, covering a wide range of annoyances from ironic covers to male pattern baldness hidden by hats.  Led Zeppelin was given an exception.  The discussion then shifted to *America's Top Inventor*, focusing on the crying contestants and the judges' reactions to various inventions.  A raunchy *Bronx Bunny* puppet show segment featuring George Takei was mentioned, followed by a musical performance by Steve Carlisi (formerly Steven Carr) and further critique of his music. The broadcast ended with the hosts acknowledging the previous day's show was "the gayest show ever," and referencing a segment involving a guest's genitals.

The final segment began with a discussion about preventing Christmas tree fires, transitioning to mocking Matt Roloff from "Little People, Big World" and his DUI arrest.  The conversation then moved to the reality show "Kid Nation," speculating about the potential for violence and sexual assault among unsupervised children.  The hosts recounted a graphic live television suicide they had witnessed, leading to speculation about the future of reality television and increasingly extreme content.  Finally, a prolonged, humorous search for a YouTube video showing the aftermath of a failed rocket launch by Middle Eastern militants concluded the show, with the video eventually found on vidmax.com. The "line of the day" was announced, and concluding remarks touched upon the show's uncertain future due to an impending XM merger. Patrice O’Neal was mentioned as a guest during this segment.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio shock jocks.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their audience.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why?  Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screw! 
[00:00:30]  Radio bad boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony.  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Radio shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Oh, it's brown.  Oh, it's brown.  Smell, smell.  Oh, yeah.  This is where entertainment is going.  So you've been stabbed once and shot twice. 
[00:01:00]  No, I've been stabbed twice.  Shot twice.  Who's the common denominator in all these problems?  Mickey and Anthony.  You have to lick a swath of the icing off so that bag shows through where icing was.  It's time for people to understand these are words.  If you don't like them, turn the dial.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Didn't we just do this? 
[00:01:30]  Of course.  We do it every ding-dong day.  I got it.  What's my Wednesday?  You know, now that I'm sleeping like a human being for the first time in, I don't know, a decade.  Are you?  When that alarm goes off at 4.30 in the morning, it's brutal.  And you might be saying to yourself, well, yeah, you guys have been doing mornings for almost three years now. 
[00:02:00]  Has it been that long?  Almost.  Jesus.  Almost three years.  Jesus H.  Christ.  But I was living like a college kid and just rat hole after rat hole after rat hole where there was always some kind of problem that made it hard to get a really good night's sleep.  Whether it was the homeless guy taking a leak right outside the window, the obnoxious people upstairs that decide they don't need a rug and just march around all night long because their hours are different than mine. 
[00:02:30]  Rolling bowling balls across the floor or whatever that sound is.  They actually did that with their cats.  Some kind of bowling ball apparatus.  Yeah, I had one of those neighbors above an apartment I lived in.  And then you got to fight the battle with the mice and the cockroaches.  You know, most of the listeners have heard all the stories.  Finally living like a human being with nice AC.  Never had AC in my room.  No?  Well, I had AC.  How the hell did you get through summer?  In the city. 
[00:03:00]  I would just...  Hot down.  Hot down.  Summer in the city.  Summer in the city.  The girls are pretty.  Girls are pretty?  I don't know.  I would just keep the window open and stuff.  Oh, that's safe.  A fan...  A little fan here or there.  Oh, that's good.  How did you not get murdered?  How did you not get murdered leaving your first floor window open?  Oh, you're silly.  Stop it.  You don't know what it's like living in New York.  Everyone has bars on their windows.  We're all in our own little prisons.  Oh, you have bars on your windows?  If you don't...  If you have an apartment in New York City and you don't have bars on your window, 
[00:03:30]  and you're less than five to six floors from the street, you're insane.  That's what I like about city life.  You have to actually lock yourself in with bars on your windows.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Holy Jesus.  And I'm in a nice neighborhood.  Oh, is that just despicable?  So, and then I'm fighting the battle with the mice and the cockroach.  So now, and when I did have AC, because you mentioned the AC, you know, we turned it on 
[00:04:00]  and then that's when we realized that the homeless guy was relieving himself in the AC unit outside  the window, so we couldn't use that anymore.  So you get nice, cool air that kind of smelt a little bad.  Yeah, so then you have to battle that.  It's like, well, the air is really cool, but it smells like, ugh, in here.  But now, living like a human being, got the nice AC, really quiet apartment, blah, blah, blah.  So when that alarm goes off at 4.30, it's just, it's just hell on earth.  It's brutal.  I curse, I curse every day.  That's hard to get out of a nice bed. 
[00:04:30]  What do you got, one of those king-sized beds that are about six feet off the floor?  Yeah, and it's just like, I just sink into this damn thing.  You were, you were happy to be fleeing your apartment.  Right, right.  A few months ago.  Right.  Hey, those stupid bars on the windows, can you open those from the inside?  No.  What if there's a fire, you're stuck in the bedroom, and you've got to get out that window?  Are you just going to be going, help, help through the bars, and people are like, oh, sorry. 
[00:05:00]  I've thought about that, and I'm not that paranoid of a guy.  For the most part, my last place, I'm like, wow, if there's a fire in here, there's only one way out.  You know, a front door.  Front door, and if that's...  And my last apartment, I had a little basement action, and the basement window had bars on it.  So, you know, if you're downstairs, and you know, I mean, you can get out of most fires,  I'm thinking, at least the, where, at least where I was living.  At least where I was living.  Really?  I know the situation here.  You're in a fire.  Let's say the fire is completely engulfing the area where you have to leave through that 
[00:05:30]  front door.  I wrap, I already figured it out.  You wrap yourself around your comforter, and you run.  You run through it.  You know how many people have tried that, and they just, they find the body wrapped in  a melted blanket with just melted person under it?  I worked out my fire scenarios a long time ago.  Like, take a, just wet my whole body, grab the comforter, and run.  That'll work.  Yeah.  As the water boils on you.  Instruments to break through the wall if I have to, and go through the next apartment. 
[00:06:00]  You know, stuff like that.  Yeah.  Yeah, I got it all figured out.  Everyone has a contingency plan, and they never work.  No, because then when you're in a real fire, just panic sets in.  You're like, ah!  You forget everything.  Oh, my God!  I'm burning alive!  Right.  But now, like, sleeping through the night, it's bizarre to me that I'm sleeping six or  seven hours without waking up now, because that just didn't happen for years.  I would just keep an eye open all night long, like, just a very light sleep, and now 
[00:06:30]  it's really, really deep sleep.  The alarm goes off, and it's just like, I just start cursing and yelling and screaming  every morning.  I got to start taping it.  It's hilarious.  Yeah, it's a rough one.  It's hilarious, the stuff I'll just start saying, and I'm like, what are you saying?  But you're not awake yet officially, so your mouth is just, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.  Sit on the edge of the bed.  Yes.  Oh, God.  Oh, I wish it was like that.  Jeez, I can't even tell you.  Dude, I wish it was like that.  I'm throwing fists in the air.  I'm throwing stuff.  I'm a maniac.  I'm a maniac, and I know I'm doing it, but I can't stop myself, because I'm not fully 
[00:07:00]  awake yet.  And then by five o'clock, 5.10, I'm fine.  And I'm happy to be alive.  I'm happy to be doing radio with you.  I'm happy to see Patrice's face.  Everything's good.  But when that alarm hits at 4.30, oh.  You should just be happy that you opened your eyes that morning.  Absolutely.  And took a breath.  And people are reminding me that I almost got murdered in Buffalo, so yeah, I don't 
[00:07:30]  have to worry about that anymore.  A rapist was checking me out once in Buffalo.  Those long, blonde locks.  I swear to God.  It's a classic story, but really fast.  Living in Buffalo, another crap hole.  It was a brownstone, and I never locked my door on the third floor, because the double  doors downstairs were always locked.  Even though it was a bad neighborhood, I figured that was good enough.  I was, I'm just a dummy.  Never enough locked doors.  And I saw some stories on the local news in Buffalo that there was some kind of rapist 
[00:08:00]  in the area.  You know, the rapist hit over here, over there, and the streets were-  Some kind of rapist?  Raping men?  No.  Well, that's the beauty of this.  The streets where the rapist was doing his work were within range of where I was living,  but nothing to, like, be too concerned, plus the fact, yes, Patrice, I'm a guy, and this  particular rapist was going after women.  Chicks.  And one day, I was doing overnights.  I walked back to the brownstone, and I see both doors wide open, propped open, and some 
[00:08:30]  dude is moving out of the brownstone.  And I walked past him, not thinking anything about it, and went up to my third-story apartment  and decided I needed to crash in the middle of the day.  I was really, really tired.  Next thing I know, I wake up because there's a guy, a black guy, in a hoodie, pulled tight  around his face, inches from my face, leaning down, looking at me.  And back then, I had long hair.  He thought you were beautiful. 
[00:09:00]  Wow.  So he walked into the apartment.  He saw me sleeping, saw the long hair.  It was kind of down to my shoulders.  And now he was checking to see if I was a girl or not.  And he got this close to my face.  I wake up, and I'm just staring at another human being's eyes literally an inch from my  face.  And I didn't move, and I go, what are you doing in here?  And at that point, he jumped up and realized, what are you doing in here?  Oh, yeah.  No, I try to stay as calm as possible.  I didn't go into panic mode because I just opened my eyes, and I was screwed. 
[00:09:30]  I was in a position where there was nothing I could do.  And what did he say?  Where's your vagina?  What's wrong with him?  What's wrong with him?  He looks at me.  He goes out in the blanket.  Why is your vagina so difficult?  Realizes I'm not a woman, jumps up and runs out of the apartment.  And my heart went immediately up to 150, 160 beats a minute.  Easy.  Did he say oops or anything to make you feel better? 
[00:10:00]  Yeah, oopsie.  Didn't say a word.  My bad.  I'm going to go look around for a chick, but if I don't find one, I'll be back.  Right.  And then he ran out of my apartment, and then at this point, I was convinced he'd stole  my keys and my wallet because I always left it right near the door.  To come back and do what?  My wallet?  There might have been a few bucks in there.  I wasn't making much money back then, but there might have been something in there or  something in the apartment.  Actually, now that I think about it, I had nothing that this guy would have wanted.  How'd you correlate this to that this guy was definitely the rapist? 
[00:10:30]  What if this was the black guy making a mistake, dude?  Like, where was the rape?  You know what?  I just let this story go by.  Dude, I've told the story four or five times, and now you're calling me out on it.  I've never heard this story, but how do you completely refer this guy to the rapist of  Buffalo?  I have to just assume it was him.  What else was he doing looking at me an inch away from my face?  Was that the description of the Buffalo rapist hoodie and this and that?  Honestly, it was a black guy. 
[00:11:00]  They finally caught him.  So, I mean, that much is true.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know if it was the same guy.  Bad black guys.  Why would he be pretty much on his knees an inch away from my face?  That's true.  Why?  I mean, he could have peeked in my room.  He saw someone sleeping there.  He could have still tried to, like, steal something from my apartment and start running, right?  Well, you know, we have to immediately defend black people just in case.  I'm sure he was going to rape him.  Hey, this is an old story for the faithful listeners.  If you got another angle on it, I would love to hear it. 
[00:11:30]  I'm just saying that I actually, you know, it is strange for him to be kneeling down looking  you dead in the face.  It was the scariest moment of my life.  And you had the long rock hair.  Long rock hair, kind of like, sort of like a Kurt Cobain blonde.  And you were covered up.  And you had the blanket over you and you were just...  I guess, yeah.  Yeah, he was going to probably rape you.  Yeah.  I never doubted it.  What are you going to do?  I'm sure...  I never doubted the story.  You know, you want to just go with the thing, you know what I'm saying?  Yeah.  Just rape it.  You know. 
[00:12:00]  Or maybe...  A white guy's not going to agree just 110%.  You're like, oh, that dirty rapist.  Maybe he was just going to rob me.  He was so pissed that he opens up this apartment and there's really nothing in there.  And now he's waking me up like, what the F, dude?  Excuse me.  What's wrong with you?  Valuables.  Why don't you have anything?  Yeah, he's going to lecture you on life.  How dare you be a poor white man?  Yeah.  What are you doing?  He was probably pissed when he opened up the door and he saw the big spool in the middle  of the living room as my entertainment center.  That was your table.  The big electrical spool and milk crates. 
[00:12:30]  And milk crates.  And went, ah, man.  A glass table made out of cinder blocks and some glass that found up the street.  White trash.  What the hell am I going to use?  What am I going to do with a stop sign?  I picked the wrong apartment.  He had the prototype George Foreman grill.  The one before Foreman.  Prototype grill.  You know, I want to look at this differently.  I bet you that he was just pissed off that there was nothing to do. 
[00:13:00]  Nah, he was going to rape you.  He'd file you.  I want to.  Because the kneeling down was the.  Yeah, that's a little odd.  Because I had, I mean, I had no money that to the point I had the mattress just laying on  the floor.  No box spring or nothing.  So he had to get way down low to see what I was all about.  Why would he do that?  Yeah.  He was going to rape a poor white woman.  That's even more.  Yeah.  Might as well go to jail.  Right?  Rape a wealthy white woman.  What's wrong with this guy?  Rape some rich buffalo white woman. 
[00:13:30]  What's he doing?  He's in the poor part of town.  A dirty white woman that looks like a poor male DJ.  Yeah.  That's what he was gunning for.  What the hell is wrong with him?  Jeez, man.  So finally.  Step your game up, brother.  So finally living like a human being.  That's what I'm getting at today.  I've lived in attics and basements and among rats and black mold and homeless guys doing  what they do outside the apartment.  You sound like you have first class syndrome.  You know, when you first start flying first class, you feel a little.  I feel guilty.  You feel a little guilty for living how you live. 
[00:14:00]  I used to feel like that in first class.  Like, I just, we all should be like this.  It's like, ah.  Why isn't the whole plane like this, man?  Man, this is bad.  Why can't people have room?  We had the curtain, man, separating societies, even on the plane.  And then it's like, shut that thing.  I don't want to hear that baby screaming.  Yeah, yeah.  Where's my drink?  It's been a minute.  And then you, as I feel so good when they say, first class customers, please.  I feel so good standing up.  Yeah.  Please board.  We are boarding first class customers only. 
[00:14:30]  That's me.  I just stand there and look behind me left and right at all the white people going, why  is he getting up?  The restrooms to the front are for our first class guests only.  Please do not use them if you're in the back.  Patrice brings up a good point, though.  There is a guilt associated with that.  Like, I feel guilty that I'm living like a human being now.  That's because your market is, they're working class dudes and ladies, man.  It's hard for you to go, ah, I live in a smushy bed. 
[00:15:00]  I bought one of those Tempur-Pedic mattresses.  Well, we had a designer come over because I need serious help trying to make the place  look like something.  Oh.  And he asked the question.  He goes, so what do you like?  And I realized last night, ah, I don't know what I like.  And it was kind of depressing.  I'm like, I don't know.  See, that's what happens.  Crown molding is what you like.  Crown molding is king.  I don't know what that is.  Well, you'll learn.  I don't know what that is.  Be better. 
[00:15:30]  I went, when he said, what do you like, just to get an idea, I just started picturing  radio stations, and I'm like, oh, I like industrial.  That's what, I like industrial.  You won't like industrial.  And I want you to only shop Fresh Direct from now on.  Right.  And I go, I like industrial, and I like comfy, comfy, comfy industrial.  Exactly.  What colors do you like?  I went, blue.  I'm a fan of blue.  I like blue. 
[00:16:00]  He's just rolling his eyes, because he does this for a living.  I'm like, all right, black, black and white.  I like black and white.  And I like brown clothes.  I look good in brown, so brown.  Brown, blue, black, and white.  You've got a long way to go.  You have to paint your house like a brick, Georgian brick.  Yes.  Yes.  See, I don't know any of that.  Minnesota ocean.  I'm looking for a burnt almond color for the...  You don't say yellow.  You say sunshine-ish. 
[00:16:30]  Yes.  I just want a few nice things around my apartment.  But I realized last night, I'm like, I don't know.  I don't know what I like.  It was kind of depressing.  I've been going through this for about a year, and you are in just so much trouble.  You don't know what you want.  Dude, it's hours and days and weeks and years of tedium and boredom.  I have to go to these places and look through these giant books.  They're like huge loose-leaf binders with fabric in them. 
[00:17:00]  And you look at the fabric and go, this...  And then the woman will take out like three fabrics and lay them on top of each other and go,  see how this one brings out the blue in this one?  And I'll go, yeah.  And meanwhile, I'm thinking, no.  I don't see any...  This didn't bring out this.  It's nothing.  Can I say something?  Yes.  Here's what you do.  Decide that you guys embrace like hot rod, the hot rod thing.  That side, embrace fabrics. 
[00:17:30]  Like take that side.  I'm not embracing fabrics ever.  Embrace the fabrics.  I did.  It's wonderful thinking like a sissy when it comes to being domestic.  I did.  Thousand thread count sheet.  I am...  Oh, yeah.  I know what a wonderful thing it is to sleep on thousand thread counts.  What does that mean?  Is it soft?  Don't know.  Oh, it just...  I have no clue.  Is it soft?  It's just better than...  It's better than 300.  They're tight, smooth sheets.  I want to feel like it's soft.  That's all.  Thousand thread count.  All right.  Then that's what I want. 
[00:18:00]  That's what I need.  Soft.  I got chairs delivered that I picked out the...  Well, me and my girl picked out the chair and the fabric and everything.  And they deliver them.  And it just...  I'm like, I could have just gone to, like, Ikea.  No, you couldn't have.  And just gotten...  Well, then you realize I couldn't have.  And how great is it to tell somebody to watch the walls?  Just put it right there.  Don't scratch anything.  Really?  You'll watch it again.  Dude, you are in just a hell for a while. 
[00:18:30]  What's your girl doing?  Is she into it?  Yeah, of course she's into it.  That means I'm going to be living in a place that she likes.  That's where you messed up.  I'm serious.  I wouldn't let my girl pick a color.  I think this should be earthy.  Nope.  This is going to be plaid.  Plaid?  Nah, I'm just saying.  I know plaid socks.  My mouth is reddish.  Reddish.  I live in hell.  Really, is it like a decadent red kind of...  I've got a lot of reddish.  Kevin from Connecticut, I have seven count sheets.  Seven count sheets.  That's how I grew up, bro. 
[00:19:00]  I was embarrassed.  My first thousand...  It was from Marshalls.  They just had an extra thousand thread count.  I'm like, what's the difference?  So I go home in my little potato chip sheets.  If you've got to drink milk to land.  If you've got to sleep in these sheets, you've got to drink water.  And I've got these thousand thread counts.  I pull them out, slide them, get in.  It's almost like you immediately start dreaming about a better place.  Really?  Putting yourself in some thousand thread counts.  I'm sorry. 
[00:19:30]  It's just you get introduced to something nice, a standard of living.  It's like cable.  It's like, oh, people are proud.  I don't like talking to people who are proud to not have something.  And it's like, oh, cable.  It's wonderful to have 4,000 channels.  Of course it is.  Imagine whether you watch it or not.  Just three.  I remember the old days.  Just three.  Click, click, click, click.  Click.  That was it.  Click, click, click, click.  Two, four, seven.  And then you have five and 11 here in New York.  Oh, you got five.  Central AC.  Everybody should live nice. 
[00:20:00]  All right.  Listen, we've got to take a break.  We're getting a little late here.  But Patrice O'Neill in studio today.  Yes.  At the ONA Trial and Virus Comedy Show in Mansfield, Patrice was like educating me on  this whole pit bull fighting thing.  Oh, it's a big.  So we should get into that next.  I hear it's big.  Well, we'll get into it.  I don't know how big it is.  Widespread.  We'll get into it next.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And we had Reverend Al Sharpton on O'Reilly last night talking about Michael Vick.  Yeah.  You know, talking about how he's innocent until he's proven guilty and all that. 
[00:20:30]  That's convenient.  All that fun stuff.  That's convenient when it's a black guy.  I would like to think that Imus was a bit innocent.  It just stands with Reverend Al.  This is just.  All right.  We'll get into it next.  We'll get into it next.  Reverend Al.  It's Opie and Anthony.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  It's Whip Him Out Wednesday.  Let's not forget about that.  Of course not.  We get Pet Shop Boys playing.  It's the bravery, actually. 
[00:21:00]  An honest mistake.  It's an honest.  Oh, I know.  I know that song from baseball.  A baseball game.  Baseball game.  One of the video games.  Oh, really?  It's one of those songs in the game.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's Whip Him Out Wednesday.  Of course.  Let's give the big plug for Whip Him Out Wednesday because, you know, the show's got  a bit gay.  We'll be discussing that a little later this morning, but the show's getting a little  gay.  For this side of the show, yesterday we were promoting Hot Rod. 
[00:21:30]  We had Andy Sandberg come in, and Steve and everyone thought it would be a great idea  to have guys come in and rub Icy Hot and Ben Gay all over there.  You know what?  All over a very sensitive area.  Hence, Hot Rod.  And in the middle of this thing, I'm thinking to myself, where did we go wrong?  Something is very, very wrong with this radio show.  Yeah.  It just took a turn for the worse.  But you know what?  I've got to defend the show. 
[00:22:00]  We want to have hot chicks in here.  We've got a stripper pole.  We want to do all sorts of things with hot chicks.  For some reason, the lawyers don't want girls topless.  I don't even think they want them in here with panties and pasties at this point.  Yeah, I don't know what the ruling is now.  So then we're like, well, we've still got to do good radio, so we start doing stuff with  guys.  She's gay.  And doing gay stuff with guys is okay with the lawyers, but seeing hot chicks in panties 
[00:22:30]  Emasculating men is the movement that we're standing for.  But then we got caught up in the whole thing, because we still got to do good radio, and  we went down this really creepy path.  And I have to acknowledge today that it's just wrong.  So let's not forget, we have Whip Em Out Wednesday.  Pal Talk is happening today.  I've already seen a bunch of girls flashing in honor of Whip Em Out Wednesday.  I know here in New York, K-Rock is getting brand new WOW stickers together.  We're going to start handing them out again.  And basically, you throw the sticker on your car or make a homemade WOW sign, and there 
[00:23:00]  are girls all over America listening to us right now that are willing to flash you if  they see a WOW sticker or a WOW sign on your car.  They will.  They're destroying the fabric of the movement, the now movement.  If you're going to a sporting event or a concert or you're going to the beach and you're  stuck in traffic, it's a perfect place to have the WOW sticker.  Perfect place, because everyone is just driving and they're bored, and the girls are more  than willing to do this. 
[00:23:30]  All we ask is you don't harass the ladies.  Let them do their thing.  They don't want to have sex with you.  They don't want you following them.  They don't give a crap about you.  They just want to flash real fast and move on.  Why are you saying that?  So we can keep doing it, Patrice.  The flories are trying to shut us down as far as this goes, too.  Really?  Yes.  Follow girls home.  You have to say, hey, don't harass?  Yes.  Yes.  Because some dopey guys will follow them home.  Hey, you showed me something.  What do you know about you?  You obviously want me.  You're a slut. 
[00:24:00]  Right.  Dummies.  But you know what?  This WOW thing, we've been doing it for well over 10 years now.  About 10 years, I guess.  I think about 10 years.  And we have had no problems.  So the guys know what's up.  Keep it that way.  We like to just remind them.  I know it's kind of pathetic.  But this is where we're at in radio, Patrice.  Yes.  Very understandable.  All right.  Patrice in for Jim Norton.  Let's not forget Jim Norton out there in L.A.  He's doing Jimmy Kimmel tonight.  That's really, really cool.  Our phone number, 877-212-ON-A. 
[00:24:30]  We want to get into the Michael Vick thing.  You want to play this clip again for Patrice?  Oh, yeah.  And then we can get into it.  And Patrice, you have a great angle on this.  We sort of touched on it yesterday.  But Patrice will hammer this home.  CNN sports anchor Larry Smith suggests crimes on a dog are worse than crimes on a woman.  That's how this clip is labeled.  Stupid Nancy Grace, who's just a troublemaker.  She stinks.  She dissected every word this guy said.  Right.  And kind of took it for what she meant it as. 
[00:25:00]  The guy kind of wasn't able to really...  I don't think he was able to articulate his point of view on this thing, his thoughts very well.  Well, but she jumped on him.  Yeah.  And I don't think what he said was what she was implying he said.  She made a huge leap.  Yeah.  Well, let's listen to the clip again, and then we'll get into this Michael Vick thing.  And he loses it.  I have to Larry Smith, CNN sports correspondent and CNN anchor.  Yeah, it should be noted, if you didn't hear this yesterday, our favorite part of this whole clip, we don't even care that she's, like, being a troublemaker. 
[00:25:30]  What's funny is Larry Smith went...  Right after she calls him out, he just goes...  And then changes the subject completely and doesn't answer the question.  Yeah.  I have to Larry Smith, CNN sports correspondent and CNN anchor.  What's Vick afraid of?  Come on, he's been in front of the camera a million times.  What's so hard about declaring your innocence?  Yeah, well, he's been in a lot of trouble lately when you think about all the other incidents, and this is just the worst one of all. 
[00:26:00]  And keep in mind, too, that while Colby Bryan is a situation, we can sort of compare this to...  This really is much worse.  Not only can you argue that the crimes are much worse in terms of, you know, killing dogs and that kind of thing, but as an NFL starting quarterback, you are the most visible face in that city.  I mean, I've said it all along, is that, you know, if you try to go through and, you know, very quickly name ten mayors of major cities in the country...  Larry Smith, did I just hear you say...  You could have a harder time doing that than naming ten NFL starting quarterbacks. 
[00:26:30]  Did I just hear Larry Smith, CNN sports correspondent and anchor, state that crimes on a dog are much worse than crimes on a woman?  Did I hear that?  Uh, I'm sorry, you, I'm saying they could be...  I'm sorry, you, I say they could be...  I'm sorry, you, I'm sorry, you, I said...  I'm sorry, you, I...  Because everyone in the media, all of us, we're all panicky peeps because all the crap that has happened recently... 
[00:27:00]  In that delay, in that gap where he's not talking, his mind was like, oh my god, I'm fired!  Right!  Holy Jesus, front page!  Holy baloney!  He's thinking Imus, obviously, maybe thinking Opie and Anthony with the crap we just went through.  Oh my god, you!  Bye!  Instead of calling out on her dismissive...  Well, well, what's this...  Hold on, hold on, hold on, because you're revving up.  Let me get to the end of the clip, because Patrice's got a great take on this. 
[00:27:30]  I hear that.  I'm sorry, you, I'm saying they could be, I'm not arguing which is worse, which one is worse.  I'm just saying that in terms of his visibility is much worse.  His visibility is much worse than what Kobe Bryant's is.  Kobe Bryant is a superstar in the NBA, but at the same time, he plays in Los Angeles, which is a city full of stars.  Michael Vick is the most visible person in the city of Atlanta, maybe ever in the history of Atlanta sports.  You ever see a backpedal like that?  He tried to get back on track, but he was still off-roading, man. 
[00:28:00]  Is that what I'm hearing?  Is that what I'm hearing?  Yeah.  Excuse me, did I just hear...  And she's got to say his name, where he works, his address.  Larry Smith.  Larry Smith, who resides at 263.  But this is the whole, that whole little montage.  Yeah.  It was, everything was so calculated.  Even her, like, late response as if she was collecting her pain.  She was thinking to herself, like, she was so shocked that he would say that. 
[00:28:30]  It's like, get out of here.  This is what his phony is.  First of all, why did he bring up Kobe?  This is what he got into.  Trying to be a little smarmy idiot.  He brings up a comparison to Kobe the Rapist and Michael Vick the Dog Killer.  He got what he deserved on his little uncomfortable thing.  Right.  The second thing he deserved is because he's a phony.  He's a phony.  And when he goes, when she goes, are you saying that?  Like, and he let herself get painted into this little punk corner. 
[00:29:00]  It's like, look, first of all, lady, I'm trying to say this in about five seconds.  Because I know you're going to another commercial.  Right.  Secondly, I'm comparing the, not that, the fact that rape is lesser, like dog killing and rape should be compared.  Yeah.  In any way, shape, or form.  That the Kobe case ended up being a nothing.  It's a nothing case compared to this Michael Vick case.  Yeah.  Because it ended up being the girl completely dismissing it. 
[00:29:30]  Right.  She lied.  Yeah.  That's what this guy was saying, but he didn't have his hour and a half to put it all in context.  Right.  So now that we can't allow ourselves to put what we say in context, and he's trying to steal with his phony baloney self, go, he should have just said, look, Nancy, why did you try to put me in this spot?  You know I'm not saying that you.  Yeah.  Are you crazy to even try to paint me in that corner?  That's what's going on in the media, too.  Everyone's looking for the next I'm his situation. 
[00:30:00]  They get excited.  Oh, they want to trip someone up.  Because if Nancy Grace has that on her show, it's going to be big for her.  That was the time it took for her to go, am I going to do this or am I not going to do this to you guys?  Let me pull the trigger.  Hmm.  Yeah.  Here I go.  I'm going to do it.  Here I go.  Oh, she's phony.  I hate her.  Did I hear you just say that dog killing is worse than rape?  Shut up.  That's pretty much it.  That's why he was like, he should have said, yeah.  You know, I'm changing my tune, and that's why he went into hum and a hum and a mode, because he's like, did I say that? 
[00:30:30]  What?  I did.  Did I say that?  I wasn't really saying that.  But I'm not sure.  Opie, he's so phony that if she said, if it was a reverse case, and she goes, are you saying that raping women is a worse crime than killing a dog?  He would have went, I'm not saying.  He would have questioned his own self and go, wait, is dog killing? 
[00:31:00]  Is it?  I don't know.  And by the way, this is coming from an expert, because when we went through our whole thing that happened a couple months ago, Patrice was on Sean Hannity, and he got into this type of situation with the lady from now.  Oh, that was on another show, too.  Huh?  That was on.  Oh, it wasn't that, Sean.  It was John Gibson.  John Gibson, who you almost got fired.  Yeah, you almost got him fired.  Did you think about that?  Did you think about that?  Were you thinking like, hmm, should I say this? 
[00:31:30]  Absolutely not.  You know I don't think more than seven seconds before my mind.  But basically, the same type of situation was going to happen to Patrice.  This lady was trying to push him into a corner for now, and Patrice was like, look, I know what you're doing.  You're not doing this to me.  Don't even just stop.  Don't even try.  Yeah, Patrice doesn't make it.  And that's what Larry Smith from CNN should have done.  Do yourself a favor.  Go to YouTube and check it out.  I think if you put Opie and Anthony into the search, and Patrice O'Neal, obviously, it'll pop up.  It's him on John Gibson. 
[00:32:00]  It's some of the funniest stuff I've seen on TV in a long time.  Because then he's all of a sudden doing these just crazy, crazy sex jokes that you can't do on radio anymore.  And now a woman's losing her mind.  She was laughing at some point.  She was laughing.  But that's the thing.  You know what incident happened?  It happened a while ago that media men almost had a manly comeback.  The fact is when that Danica Patrick pushed that dude, pushed the guy, the other one of the racers. 
[00:32:30]  She pushed him or poked him or something.  And all the dudes were like, if a guy had to did that to her, he'd be an all type of...  And they had this debate on whether that guy should have been able to knock her in her face.  And then they just stopped it because you could feel the quest for fire coming out of you.  Keep on, ladies, with your nonsense.  Hey, if you put in on YouTube, Patrice O'Neal's school's broad on funny, you'll find it. 
[00:33:00]  School's broad on funny?  She's just up there with her...  Just her false outrage because they got nothing else to do.  Everybody's fake mad.  We need to move on.  Everybody fake mad.  You're right.  Fake mad.  Everyone's outraged.  I was watching the news in the office.  And they must have used the word outraged five times.  The survivors of the World Trade Center victims are outraged that they cannot hold a vigil this year at the World Trade Center site. 
[00:33:30]  They've got to go to a park across a...  People are outraged that a building is going up in their neighborhood that will be producing bread, a bread factory in their neighborhood.  And the outraged community came to the...  Everyone's outraged.  Is there that much outrage going on?  Outrage is like...  That's a word that should be reserved for people that really are outraged.  No, no, no.  Car bombers. 
[00:34:00]  Outrage.  Outrage.  Someone bitching because a bread place opened up next to your house.  Outrage.  It's not outrage.  Outrage.  More pigeons.  Outrage.  You're smelling rolls every morning.  Outrage.  Beautiful.  Outrage should include pitchforks and torches.  Torches.  That's outrage.  That's outrage.  Dr. Frankenstein made a monster.  He killed a girl, threw it down the wall.  That's outrage.  We are outraged.  Not one dumb person in your neighborhood that has nothing else to do, so they're trying to get something going.  It's not outrage.  Somebody's poking you, and you have to go, ah. 
[00:34:30]  Ah.  That's it.  That's outrage.  Ah.  They're outraged.  Ah.  They're outraged.  Not four people in your community with homemade signs.  Let's get them.  Yeah.  Outrage.  Right.  I still don't understand.  Somebody please explain to me the economics of why a bunch of mad old ladies can stop Pepsi from doing what they...  Like, if Pepsi supports a show that they don't like, Pepsi goes, I'm going to pull out.  Yeah.  But why... 
[00:35:00]  How much more money does Pepsi need?  Well, they can just go, you know what?  Shut up.  Just shut up.  Shut up.  How are you going to boycott me?  You're not.  You're going to drink Pepsi at your meeting to boycott me.  Yeah.  Shut up.  You know what?  The shut up is coming.  I truly believe.  You smell it.  I truly believe the shut up.  Women don't know.  This is what...  I hope for the shut up.  The shut up is coming.  This is what I'm saying about black folks.  This is what I've been saying about us.  The same thing is going to happen to women. 
[00:35:30]  The people that you keep messing with...  One of the biggest allies for black people is white guilt.  The fact that white people are going, yeah, you know, we did do some bad stuff to them.  And if we keep every second of the day, we never give white people a pass, ever.  They're going to go, this is...  You know what?  I'm done.  I'm done with the guilt.  I'm done with the guilt over the history.  And the same thing with women.  It's like women don't need to take their bras off to make statements. 
[00:36:00]  And women run the country right now because of the restraint of men.  Yeah.  And you're not giving us any credit for the fact that we're not slapping it upside the head.  We get no credit.  Like, you think that's not a given thing?  It used to be Quest for Fire.  Just grabbed by the hair and that's it.  It's weird.  We have social...  We social contract keeps us from doing certain things.  And women just continue to put us in this little... 
[00:36:30]  This pokey spot to where you go, look, you better get out of my face.  Those pictures in your cubicle are offending me.  So all of a sudden, in every office now, there's no more putting up little sexy pictures in the garages.  Remember when you'd walk into a mechanic and he'd open up the top of his toolbox and it was nothing but nude pictures from Penthouse and Playboy?  That, not allowed now.  That's sexual harassment for customers to see it. 
[00:37:00]  That's what's truly sad.  I mean, we gave up on the offices years ago.  Gave away our manhood.  And the cubicles, you know.  Gave it away.  But then it hit the firehouses and the shops.  People that were...  Places that were exclusively, you know, male.  Places where guys could just be guys, have some fun, look at some nudie pictures on the wall.  Some risque jokes can be told.  And then it was like, oh, I want to join your club.  There's no rule that says I can't join. 
[00:37:30]  And then it was like, you go to court and then she joins.  And then all of a sudden, no more fun.  You can't have things on the wall.  You can't tell off-color jokes.  You can't do this, that.  And then guys just go, oh.  I had a nasty argument with a woman officer, off-duty officer.  And I said, look, miss, you know.  She said, I'm a cop.  And we start talking.  I said, let me say something to you.  I don't think anybody should be a cop that can't arrest me if they wasn't a...  Like, if you weren't a cop, you couldn't arrest me.  The only reason you didn't arrest me is because I'm letting you.  So I think this should only be big, giant cops who can arrest me if I don't want to 
[00:38:00]  be arrested.  God, I've thought that many times.  Because you could just, you know.  A small Mexican lady telling me what to do.  I've thought about that so many times.  With a can of mace.  Right.  It's like, you know what?  I'm going to get ready to chew you like bubble gum.  Right.  I'll give you five seconds to call two bigger Kenny cops to really arrest me.  God, I've thought this exact thing.  Yeah, it's humiliating.  You're only a cop because I am allowing you to be one right now. 
[00:38:30]  Somewhere in your brain, you have to go, all right, I'll let you arrest me.  You have to comply with social contract.  Right.  If men just decided to go, look, I ain't letting women do nothing.  Shit, you now have to say, ladies, we can't have you alone anymore because your authority  is based on the fact that men are allowing you to put handcuffs on them.  You know, can I jump in here?  I learned the hard way.  When I was in college, I went down to spring break in Fort Lauderdale and they had like 
[00:39:00]  barriers set up on the sidewalk and it was just way crowded and I had to get somewhere  fast.  So I decided to get out, get in the street and start kind of running toward this bar  or wherever I was going.  I forget now.  And there was a lady cop, short, and she's trying to tell me what to do.  And I was like, you're not big enough for me to listen to you.  I'm thinking exactly what you're saying, right?  I'm like, she took out her baton and gave me a beating to the ribs that I've never forgotten.  Wow.  Did you fight back?  Oh, no. 
[00:39:30]  Of course not.  The story is over.  Of course not.  Because she took a baton out and you just bowled over because you said, I can't fight  a cop.  I sort of learned a lesson that day because up to that point, I was just like Patrice.  I'm like, unless you're bigger than me, I'm not listening to you.  Don't say that I don't comply to women.  I do comply.  No, I understand.  But you have to like, subconsciously in your mind, you have to go, all right, I will allow  you to arrest me now.  Yes!  Or I will allow you to give me a talking to her.  Why is that sexist?  Why is that foul to say if some small woman, even this, even, not even women, small white 
[00:40:00]  cops, little baby cops, put in my face, it's like you're a cop because I'm letting you be  one.  That's so true, man.  All cops would be Kenny who can stop me if I'm on a rampage.  There should be like, yeah.  It should be just Club Soda Kenny clones all over the, all over the place.  Monsters.  Monsters.  That could just take you down.  Dreads.  Just take you down. 
[00:40:30]  Right.  I am the law.  A bunch of you, those dudes, street judges.  It's like, but I'm not saying, but I'm just saying that's the thing a lot.  We get, we get this, this weird, like comfortable thing where, where you get a little power, you  start losing your mind and forget that that can go to other directions.  But it's also, you're afraid of consequence.  You're afraid of the consequence of, of assaulting an officer.  Absolutely.  That's it. 
[00:41:00]  Social contract.  So that's what it is.  But it's not even assaulting.  Like I, I want to just turn and walk away and run away.  Like, stop.  You can't catch me.  I'm fastening you.  Right.  If you're a girl.  Right.  You have all these things around your belt.  Right.  That's going to slow you up.  Yeah.  I don't want a confrontation because they're not, because they're not bigger than me.  I just want to not acknowledge that they're even in front of me trying to cause, you  know, write me a ticket or something.  And when they make their call, is this going to be a bunch of big cops that can arrest you?  Right.  10-4.  There's a big dude that's having a marriage. 
[00:41:30]  Five cars will pull up.  10-4.  There's a guy treating me like a girl.  Come on out.  Giant cops will get out?  Yeah.  And bust your ass.  Giant cops?  I'm not saying a word.  You ever see a state trooper?  You ever get pulled by a state trooper?  Oh, yeah.  You go, you know what?  Yes, sir.  No, sir.  If this dude was in jeans.  Right away, sir.  And a sweatshirt.  You go, you know, I'm just going to listen to him.  Yeah.  Without a siren.  Oh, yeah.  If he was on a BMX and said pull over, you go, wow, I'm not going to show you.  This dude looks like he's disgusting.  The glasses.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That frigging cowboy hat almost. 
[00:42:00]  The strap going around the back.  Crew cut.  Oh, yeah.  You're done.  You're done.  Those guys.  Not even a question.  If they're not on the street in their car, they are working out at a gym.  Yeah.  Because they are giant human beings.  Yep.  You just don't screw with them.  I love it, Patrice.  All right.  Listen, we were going to talk about Michael Vick and Sharpton talking about it on a while.  Oh, River Nell.  Also, hey, here in New York, we got amazing ratings recently.  Thank you, New York.  And we threw a little celebration together. 
[00:42:30]  Today, we're going to watch Superbad together at 5 p.m. at 68th and Broadway.  There's a fine movie theater there.  If you want to join us, you can call 212-833-5493 or email superbadmovie at yahoo.com.  It's for the first 300 that show up.  You get to see Superbad before it hits theaters everywhere.  5 o'clock today, 68th and Broadway with a bunch of us from the Opie and Anthony Show.  All right.  We'll continue in just a bit.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:43:00]  Patrice O'Neill in for Jim Norton today.  Jimmy's out in L.A.  He's doing Jimmy Kimmel tonight.  Make sure you take a peek at that.  Our phone number, 877-212-O-N-A.  So easy.  Hey, don't forget, tomorrow on the show, we're doing What the Hell is That?  Oh, that's tomorrow.  And it's not too late to get involved with this.  You can give us a call right now.  Using the number, 877-212-O-N-A.  Tell us what you got going on.  We got a bunch of doctors coming in tomorrow, and they're going to kind of diagnose you.  We're looking for that weird crap. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah, we have some guy coming in.  Is the guy with the big bump on his head coming in?  Yeah, we got bump guy.  And then a guy that's got a problem with his nostril.  It looks like someone took a finger, put in this guy's nostril, and just stretched it out.  And pulled it.  Across his face.  Like, wah.  Yeah.  We're just looking, and then doctors are going to take a look and inform them and us what the affliction is.  Yeah, so what the hell is that?  What the hell is that?  Tomorrow on the Opie and Anthony Show, give us a call if you want in. 
[00:44:00]  We're looking for a few more people, I think.  You got anything maybe you wanted him to take a look at?  Nah, I'm good.  I'm good these days.  I'm neither.  I'm good these days.  I'm happy.  I'm happy that I have nothing going on with my body.  Yeah, that was good.  Hey, every morning I look at the top Yahoo searches for the hell of it.  Yeah.  And, you know, it's just a bunch of random things.  And then I think to myself, why are these the top Yahoo searches for the day?  You try to break it down and think, hmm, what would make people search this out? 
[00:44:30]  And some of them are obvious.  Like, Bill Walsh is one of the top searches today because he died.  He's dead.  The famous NFL coach died.  Good evening.  So, obviously, people, you know, it's on the top of their brains.  All right, I want to, like, Google him or Yahoo search him and see what he was all about.  A lot of people do that, though.  Just out of nowhere, like, they want to know about Bill Walsh because he died.  He made the headline.  Like, the day before he died, nowhere to be found in the search engine.  Nowhere's near.  And once they die, it's like, I got to, what do I got to, why do you got to learn something about the guy? 
[00:45:00]  I don't know.  And then the second one, leukemia symptoms, and then you think, why that?  Well, because Bill Walsh had leukemia.  So, now people are in a panic, like, oh, do I have leukemia, too?  Nah.  Well, the symptoms of this.  So, that one is obvious, too.  But then you move down, Boston Celtics all of a sudden is a huge Yahoo search because they made a massive trade overnight.  Kevin Garnett is now a Celtic.  And I thought, wow, what a great trade for the Celtics.  Then you read a little further and you realize the Celtics pretty much gave up their whole team to get Kevin Garnett. 
[00:45:30]  Worth it.  Yeah, in the end, I'm sure.  Absolutely worth it, yes, sir.  But I think they gave up seven players for a whole team.  That's what they should have did.  God bless them for that, Danny A.  Thank you for that one.  Wow.  Yeah, the Boston Celtics next year is going to have Kevin Garnett and a bunch of scrubs.  A whole team and substitutes.  Right.  And five reserves, one trade for trade, like, potential superstar, and then four bench guys, and then two potential stars because they got two first-round draft picks. 
[00:46:00]  Wow.  So if the Celtics stink, then Minnesota gets two very, very high draft picks.  Right.  But the Celtics, which they're not going to stink.  But it's hilarious because this isn't football or baseball where you could do seven for one easy and kind of survive.  I mean, you're starting with 11, 12 players to begin with, and you just gave up seven of them. 
[00:46:30]  Gave up their team.  The Celtics, they're going to have six players in 2008, which is – who cares?  But that made the Yahoo search because that's a huge story in sports, Boston Celtics, all right?  Then you got Jenna Elfman.  Why is she one of the top searches today?  This is – the first three, obvious, but now I'm clueless.  Jenna Elfman from Dharma and Greg.  Danny Elfman's wife.  She's Danny Elfman's wife, and Danny Elfman wrote the Simpsons song, and they made – the fact that she's married to him made people go, oh, whatever happened to his wife, Jenna? 
[00:47:00]  Are you – is that what you –  Jenna Elfman is Danny Elfman's wife, the guy who –  Is it?  He's like writer extraordinaire, everything.  Yeah.  He writes the theme and everything.  She's married to him.  And that's why?  Because the Simpsons movie?  Because the Simpsons movie is very popular.  Is Travis saying no?  Travis is – just jump on my –  Are you – Travis –  Are you concurring?  I was just giving a – that might have been.  Well, I like the might have been, but now I want to know what it is.  But I don't like the fact that you're getting ready to just say Travis is right. 
[00:47:30]  Go ahead.  She just had a baby.  And why is that a big deal?  Who knows?  Because she's Danny Elfman's wife.  But this is how weird we are as a society.  She has a baby, and all of a sudden everyone runs to Yahoo and has to search out her name.  I don't get it.  Someone's saying it's a cousin.  She's married to him.  How come England underwater is not in the top search?  Right.  Exactly.  Thank you.  England is drowning.  England completely underwater. 
[00:48:00]  Completely underwater, but –  No one cares.  Jenna Elfman had a baby.  I got to put her name in a search engine.  We are disgusting.  It's ridiculous.  And then it gets – then, all right, here's another top search today.  Washington, D.C. hotels.  Why?  I know why.  You know that one?  Yeah, because I'm going to be at the D.C. Improv.  August 10th, 11th, and 12th.  August 10th, 11th, and 12th, D.C. Improv.  Yeah, people are preparing.  I had a time.  Patrice O'Neal.  But why is Washington, D.C. hotels on the top search? 
[00:48:30]  Let me think.  Because –  And if someone has an answer to some of these, I appreciate a call.  I'm sure it's going to be – there's something got to do with politics.  There's probably some thing going on.  All right, what is the thing?  Watergate.  No, too late?  All right, so that one we've got to figure out why.  Then Indiana Jones 4 is in –  Southest plan, pal.  That's easy.  That's in the top Yahoo searches for today.  And then this one, steak salad.  I'm sure it was some report on beef and salad.  Steak salad? 
[00:49:00]  Would Oprah bring it up?  I'm sure –  Probably Oprah brought it up, right?  Oprah brings it up.  It's going to be top search.  It doesn't matter.  Oprah decided to tell everyone what she had for dinner last night,  so now all the soccer moms need to eat some more steak salad.  I don't know.  Jill Nicolini's got a C-3PO dress on today.  Yeah, you saw that?  What the hell is that?  Jill T-3PO.  I'm not digging it.  How about this one?  Shaba Ranks.  Why is that a top Yahoo search today?  I'm impressed that that's a top Yahoo search today.  All right, but why?  Because Shaba Ranks is very specific.  He's probably going to come back.  Because that means Whitey and White America jumped on this Shaba Ranks today. 
[00:49:30]  He might be making a – maybe – oh, he – I don't know.  Yeah, because a lot of reggae stars say a lot of things about gay people sometimes.  Maybe he said a crazy remark for white people to care.  It has to be negative.  All right, and rounding out the –  It has to be negative.  It's got to be.  It's got to be.  Well, we need the answer to some of these.  And then rounding up the top searches today, you've got Meals on Wheels.  I don't know where people need to know about Meals on Wheels.  And birthday e-cards. 
[00:50:00]  These are the top searches today.  The e-cards.  And most of these we can – not most of these.  We can figure out half of these.  The other half, I want to know why all of a sudden America decided they needed to search  out these things.  There's nothing about presidential candidates or –  Right.  Iraq war or –  England drowning.  England drowning or –  Right.  Talks with Iran or –  No, this is it.  This is what we need to know today.  This is what we're searching out today.  All right.  All right.  Sharpton on O'Reilly.  Michael Vick.  So, by the way, we never asked you, is this worse than rape, what Michael Vick did? 
[00:50:30]  You know what?  The drowning of dogs.  The hanging of dogs.  I'm going to be personally responsible for what I'm getting ready to say.  Uh-huh.  So, it bothers me more, the abuse of animals, than if I hear two stories, a rape story and  someone hanging a dog story.  Yeah.  And I feel worse for the dog. 
[00:51:00]  Well, you're not alone.  I'm going to say that.  You're not alone.  We brought this up yesterday.  As far as the Kobe story goes and the Michael Vick story, this is more disturbing to people.  This story is more talked about, like people are really passionate about.  Maybe not as talked about, but they're more passionate about, did you hear what he did?  Like everyone's chitter-chattering about, they hung the dog, they slit its throat, they 
[00:51:30]  did this.  People are more like passionate about their anger than they were with Kobe.  My thing is that people don't take into account, I know there's like a society pressure or  whatever, what's the word, when the most people agree with something or whatever, the right  thing to say, I don't know.  But, people don't take into account how you feel.  Now, I'm not saying it is better or it ain't, I'm not saying.  I'm saying that when I hear two stories, the Central Park jogger rate case doesn't hit 
[00:52:00]  me as much as if somebody kicked a puppy across the street.  No, that got me pretty mad.  But it's saying, it's just what it does to you.  Yeah.  You know, that's what it did to you.  I mean, animal cruelty things hit me in a funny nerve.  Yeah.  It just hit me.  I don't like the animal cruelty.  Well, the outrage is unbelievable on this case, the people just hanging out outside  the court.  They are pissed. 
[00:52:30]  I was thinking about the animals versus human thing.  And we do it here on this show, especially Anthony.  Local news, they show little kittens.  Anthony can't get enough of the little kittens.  I fall apart.  He falls apart.  With that big forehead.  They got giant heads and little faces.  They're adorable.  Now, watch this.  Cute little kid on the same channel.  Snot nose, little booger wipers.  And I think a lot of people are the same way.  You see a cute pet, it's all, ah!  But a cute baby, you don't get the same reaction from the most part. 
[00:53:00]  If I'm out and a kid is ruining my night at dinner because his parents are stupid and  let him run around, I would have no problem if I wouldn't be arrested reaching over and  slapping him in his little face.  But if, like, there's a little kitten going, meow, meow, meow, I would give him a little bowl of milk.  I felt more for the little kittens that were stuck in the drainpipe.  Right.  Worse than I felt for little baby Jessica. 
[00:53:30]  Stuck in a drainpipe.  It was sad.  Of course.  But I'm like, oh, kittens.  The kittens.  I think people care more about their animals than other human beings.  Yeah, they do.  I do, I really, yeah, I'm sorry, but I just feel how I feel.  It's not, like, you can't judge that.  No.  It's just how you feel.  How's somebody going to judge that on you?  It's just how you feel.  Are you saying?  Yeah, yeah, I just, you know.  Don't judge me on that.  Me and Bobby and me was arguing about that all night, like, well, all animals, what about  deer hunting and that? 
[00:54:00]  I said, yeah, all of it is kind of messed up to me, but, you know, I know China, they  eat dogs, but I don't like them for doing that.  Like, I don't like that they eat dogs.  How can you eat our pets?  It's a bit creepy.  Dogs just, they love you.  A lot of people to feed over there, my friend.  Hey, let's see.  A lot of people.  Let's see what Reverend Al has to say about this, Michael.  Nonsense.  By the way, one of the searches, the Washington, D.C. hotels, the answer is simple.  They're having a marathon.  The Marine Corps marathon is this weekend or coming up soon, so people are getting their 
[00:54:30]  hotels together.  Look at the baby zebra.  Look.  Going for a walk at the beach.  Yeah, that's what a zebra wants to be doing.  Isn't it cute?  And you know what I'm mad at?  That this woman is pulling it.  Yeah.  And the zebra kind of doesn't want to go.  He's making that, I don't want to go.  Pull him back.  I'm like, trample that lady that's pulling you.  Yeah.  That's how I feel about it.  Yeah.  That's how I feel about it.  I laugh when a bear attacks a kid or a homeowner because I love those stories because the bear 
[00:55:00]  is just doing what it's supposed to be doing and we're building into their environment,  so I laugh.  I laugh.  That's how I feel wonderful.  Shark attacks.  An elephant tramples a family at the zoo for poking it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  When an elephant just kind of instinctively realizes, I'm better than all of you.  What do you-  I'm going to stomp and kill you.  I've been listening to this idiot and then he just takes a tusk and wings him 25 feet  in the air.  No one pisses me off about that, though.  Like, yeah, a stupid family from Arkansas is poking at the bear. 
[00:55:30]  Bear gets a hold of the kid or-  They shoot it.  And then they have to shoot the bear because they think the bear's crazy now or the animal's  crazy in this situation.  I hate that.  He's tasted blood.  All he was doing was doing what it's supposed to do if you poke at it.  I didn't know you had such great feelings towards animals there, my friend.  For the most part, yeah.  I don't think humans are much more important than animals in general.  I just don't.  I don't think under the eyes of whatever you believe in, God or science.  I really think it's not that much different.  We're the same bug that we really are. 
[00:56:00]  Crawling around on this rock.  We just think.  Yeah.  We just think we're better.  We think different.  We're just not that important.  I was thinking about it the other day.  Wow, we get to play video games and go to some mundane job.  We're supposed to be more important than a bear.  We got good minds for figuring stuff, and we got thumbs.  That's pretty much what gives us carte blanche here on this planet.  But I wonder what that means in God's eyes.  He's probably looking like, fuck, dude, stop.  That's nothing.  You got lucky with thumbs? 
[00:56:30]  Yeah, we got real lucky with thumbs.  Right.  Got lucky to have thumbs.  Thumbs.  All right, here's, uh, here's, uh, is this worth even?  I haven't thought about that thumbs.  Thumbs.  That's what makes us special.  That makes us special.  We got quick clips.  I don't know if it's worth it.  We'll try it.  Reverend Al, we definitely want to play.  Reverend Al on Bill O'Reilly.  Here we go.  Do you think the NAACP was wise to stick up for Michael Dick?  I think that I said originally I'm absolutely against dogfighting, but this man is innocent  until proven guilty, Bill. 
[00:57:00]  And I think that the NAACP was right to say that, wait a minute, let's have the same balance  here that we have when anybody else is accused.  This man has not been convicted.  He's already lost his job.  He's lost a lot of people.  Oh, he's lost his job?  Oh, like Don Imus?  Why does that make white people so mad?  I'll tell you why.  Because innocent until proven guilty, Imus did not get that.  He did not get that.  Okay.  And it was words. 
[00:57:30]  It was words.  He lost his job doing exactly what he was paid to do.  He was indicted in the public opinion, and he was indicted.  This is Imus.  He was indicted.  He didn't go on court.  He lost his job from public opinion.  And so, and to be fair, so has it Michael Vick just now.  Yeah.  He's lost his job from public opinion.  So why doesn't Reverend Al understand that and just say, hey, that's the way it works?  That's why I don't understand why we never can admit that.  And we can't, black people, we can't give y'all anything because we have to be, have allegiance 
[00:58:00]  all the time.  See, that's what's killing the black-white relationship.  You know, why don't you try to relate to the fact that white people don't have to give  a damn about nothing, not even other white people.  You're right.  That's not how black people-  Jeffrey Dahmer kills people.  We don't go, oh my God, you know, why are people crucifying this white guy?  We don't care.  We're like, hey, he's guilty.  Right.  Kill him.  You throw away everything. 
[00:58:30]  Yeah.  Black people are not allowed socially to toss anybody for white people.  But yeah, I have to.  Why can't black people just assimilate and say, you know something, I'm not going to  stick up for black people just because they're black.  You know why?  You get called a sellout.  If you say it, but all the problems would like end.  If you took responsibility, look it, if Michael Vick is doing what he's doing, personally,  I think it doesn't look good.  Right.  Because first of all, the government, not that this makes you guilty or innocent, the government 
[00:59:00]  really never brings too many frivolous indictments.  Right.  Right.  You get nine out of ten.  This is-  Two is one of his boys said, forget about it.  I'm snitching.  I'm not going to go through this.  And he funded me.  It's just, if you read the indictment, it goes from 2001 to now.  And it's just so specific.  I think he probably did it.  But you got to, in certain worlds, like if you, the guy, Clinton Portis, he goes, man, 
[00:59:30]  it was a dog.  I got friends that don't give a damn about dogs.  And the thing is, pit bulls, and I love animals.  I've never petted a pit bull.  No.  Pit bulls is just one of those things you have.  You don't see an old white woman walking down the street with a pit bull as her loving animal.  No.  They're dangerous.  They're made to intimidate.  Let's add to the list, though.  I don't pet pit bulls or greyhounds.  Why? 
[01:00:00]  Do you see a greyhound?  When you see a greyhound walking around.  They are strange.  You cut yourself on his nose.  They were bred to run.  I mean, they weren't bred to walk around the streets in New York.  When you see a greyhound, it's creepy.  It's creepy to see.  It's creepy.  With the little up back.  There's actually one in my building, and I actually say that under my breath.  Yuck.  I rescued him.  I rescued him.  But they have a lovableness, though.  No.  Pit bulls, and I don't want anything to ever happen to them.  But it's almost like I don't want anything to happen to Tasmanian devils, either. 
[01:00:30]  I wouldn't pet one.  You know what I mean?  Right.  And we want to get through this.  So, John in New Hampshire, he writes, innocent until proven guilty unless you're a police  officer or athlete at Duke.  See?  No, the white thing.  That's what I'm saying.  But see, white people didn't defend the Duke lacrosse dudes.  White people didn't go, I don't think.  What it was is, black people were like, good.  The Scottsboro boys, the Central Park kids who were let out of jail for not doing it. 
[01:01:00]  All of that stuff.  But the thing is, the war of words on these news things, which is always like, well, what  about when white people, and it's like, it's a rhythm that we got to figure out how to say  something else, because the news is so versed in hypocrisy.  It's like, what's the, not Hannity, but the other one.  O'Reilly?  No.  Combs? 
[01:01:30]  Combs, Alan, Combs.  I like Alan Cohn.  Yeah.  But he goes, he goes, he kept asking, is, is dog, to the NAACP, NAACP guys, is dogfighting  heinous?  And the guy goes, is what you do heinous?  And he started naming all these things, and he goes, that's off the subject.  It's like, it's just, it's a merry-go-round.  Why can't they just go, yeah, dogfighting is heinous.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's foul.  Well, the NAACP comes out and says, why can't he be treated like he should be? 
[01:02:00]  Not convicted until he's found guilty.  And then they say, you know, the Duke lacrosse players went through this.  Because they're white.  But the thing is, the NAACP are the ones that were saying, this poor woman was raped by  And if the white guy, if a white guy, if white people say that to them, they would  do the same.  That's not the point.  Why can't we just be people?  Why do you black guys gotta, like, stick up for every other black guy that's doing something? 
[01:02:30]  It's just the way it is.  But if you stop, it's causing too many problems.  Let me let you in on a whitey secret.  Here's a whitey secret that we have at the meetings sometimes.  We don't care.  If you guys stopped doing that so much, it would solve so many problems.  We wouldn't be like, oh, there they go again.  Oh, there they go, defending the guy that we all know is guilty.  But then, with that reason, there wouldn't be a use for certain people that get that 
[01:03:00]  going.  But you're judging people.  Yeah, like Reverend Al and the NAACP.  They're judging people by the color of their skin and not the contents of their character.  Exactly the opposite of the great Dr. Martin Luther King.  My point is, we would be allowed to continue to do that if we would just stop, like, always  having to defend.  Just like most people think Michael Jackson is guilty, in the public opinion.  Most people believe him to have did some stuff. 
[01:03:30]  Sure.  But we don't believe it in front of you.  We're not allowed to say it in front of white people.  Why is it so separatist?  You did it!  No!  You didn't do it!  You're never going to get the answer.  It's so separatist.  It would be a crime if we didn't get a few more of these clips on.  But you've got to admit to it, too.  That's your separatist.  No.  That white people are separatists.  No!  That's what the problem is.  You never admit that you're foul.  I'll admit that we're separatists. 
[01:04:00]  I am not taking any crap for stuff that happened hundreds of years ago.  I don't care.  Why do I have to take crap?  And I don't have any guilt for it.  Why do I have to?  Exactly!  But that's the thing.  Black people have got to take crap for Michael Vick.  Why do they call me on Fox News when somebody black does something?  Because the news loves pitting whites and blacks against each other.  Exactly.  I know that.  And you can say no to going on those programs.  But I'm not because...  Here's why.  It's self-serving. 
[01:04:30]  Oh, I know.  I know why you go on this, Dan.  It's like Patrice O'Neal.  Exactly!  Here I am.  Patrice O'Neal dot com!  Exactly!  Let's get another clip on the air here.  I can respect that more than anything.  Self-serving.  If you were the NFL commissioner, would you have suspended him?  If I was the NFL commissioner, I would not have suspended him.  18-page federal indictment and his friend turning straight evidence against him?  If there was 40 pages, you cannot presume his guilt.  And I'm one against dogfighting.  But I'm also unilaterally opposed to second-guessing what a jury may or may not do. 
[01:05:00]  Why wouldn't he have suspended him or fired him from his job right now?  Here's the point.  Why?  Here's the why he's saying that.  Well, he's going to explain it right here.  Okay.  And then we'll go.  You would have allowed him to play, even though the indictment is so damning, and there is  now, we know, public evidence by this Taylor guy.  But suppose if this Taylor guy blows up in our face?  Suppose if the indictment is wrong?  Listen, absolutely.  I don't want to convict him.  But the league has an obligation, and any company does, to run the thing efficiently. 
[01:05:30]  I think the league has an obligation to run it efficiently.  I think the league could have said we've got to alter some things because he may be on  trial.  But to act as though he's already guilty, even if he did this, I would absolutely denounce  him.  God, I just think Imus, Imus, Imus, Imus, Imus through this whole thing, man.  On a certain level, and I'll tell you why.  Why couldn't Imus continue doing his thing, and then there were...  He's not being kicked off because he did it. 
[01:06:00]  No.  He's being kicked off for the court of public opinion, and you're allowed to have that.  The NFL is kicking him out on their opinion.  Yeah.  He should be gone.  And I'm not the...  It's not...  They're not...  He's not in jail.  No, no, that's just it.  But Pac-Man Jones is gone.  But the guy Tank Johnson's gone, but he got convicted.  Pac-Man Jones is only indicted.  He punched a stripper, but he's allegedly punched a stripper.  They let him go for the whole season.  Reverend Al is arguing as if he's in jail. 
[01:06:30]  He's not in jail.  They haven't convicted him.  They fired him from his job because it's a company.  I think you should be able to play, by the way.  Oh, but here's the Al Sharpton argument.  I'll tell you what the argument is, is that Imus said what he said.  Michael Vick, there absolutely isn't any tangible evidence that says he did it.  He's being accused of it.  Someone said he did it. 
[01:07:00]  It's almost like if Imus said the nappy-headed hoe thing, and no one else was around except  for a girl who heard him and goes, he called me a nappy-headed hoe.  And Imus goes, sue me.  And then they fire him due to the time it's taken to prove that he said that.  That is the argument, is that Michael Vick is absolutely right now innocent.  He's absolutely innocent until he's proven guilty, which is a fair argument.  And that's why he should definitely be able to play in the NFL this season. 
[01:07:30]  So is the lacrosse team.  I'm looking at both sides.  I like looking at both sides.  You know, people got points.  Speaking of Duke lacrosse, here we go.  When you have a situation where the NAACP speaks out in defense of Michael Vick, but  didn't say a word in the rape case.  No, they said a word.  Even after it came out that there wasn't any evidence.  Is that smart for the NAACP?  NAACP, shouldn't they be a social justice organization for all Americans?  Yes, they should. 
[01:08:00]  I think they are.  Reverend William Barber, who has the NAACP in North Carolina, said a lot afterward.  And I think that maybe he didn't get the coverage.  No, I didn't see it.  But I think he's been consistent before and after Duke.  But they should have done a press conference like this.  Well, maybe they had a big platform in the press.  You guys are selective.  I'll agree with that.  You know what I like?  I do like the respect that Bill O'Reilly has given Al.  Al has proven that he's not lame on these shows.  I don't understand how Reverend Al is getting any respect on any of these shows. 
[01:08:30]  No, O'Reilly, put it this way.  I'm not saying he respects him as a person, but he's not giving him that O'Reilly tone  of like, he's like, all right, well, how about this now, Al?  He's doing a little soft shoe.  Al has proven his point that he can hang, dude.  I think O'Reilly's got a lot of white guilt.  I don't think he has a drop.  That dude got ludicrous fired from Pepsi just because he felt like it.  All right, listen, we got to take a break. 
[01:09:00]  Don't forget, we got Chris Hansen coming in at 8 o'clock.  Yes.  That's going to be pretty interesting considering...  Did you hear the clip from Dateline to catch a predator?  Your boy?  Yeah.  It's not...  Our boy.  It's not one of our boys.  He just happened...  Oh, you've announced him now.  He's still going to court.  See how white people do?  White people will just go.  I don't know that nigga.  Never heard of him.  Never heard of that.  Even though he's a MySpace page, we're all on his friends list. 
[01:09:30]  I love him.  Y'all just threw him right in the garbage.  Never heard of that rapist.  Just because he said that he heard Chris Hansen on the O'Brien Anthony show doesn't mean  he's an actual fan of the O'Brien Anthony show.  Black people would defend this man.  Oh, yeah.  If he was a black guy, we would go, you can't just do that.  Can't do that.  Well, we got to learn from the black man because...  Throw you in the garbage.  I'm not...  I don't think he's a faithful listener.  I would like to talk to this guy and see how many hours a week he listens.  White loyalty does not exist. 
[01:10:00]  We're talking about this clip right here.  I want you to just keep your hands right where I can see them, okay?  And I want you to sit right down there.  No, keep your hands right where I can see them.  Is that a wild sticker?  What is this right here?  Some pot.  Some pot.  And what was your plan tonight?  I want him to come down, you know?  Come down.  Talk to her?  Talk to her.  You're Chris Hansen?  I am.  Have you seen this show?  You have, too.  I thought you were real funny on O'Brien Anthony. 
[01:10:30]  Oh, you listened to me on O'Brien Anthony?  Can I honestly tell you something?  I almost think in the back of my mind that I almost wanted this to happen.  I almost think in the back of my mind that I almost wanted this to happen.  Maybe, you know, Scott and Todd were in commercial and he was just flipping around the dial.  Yeah, he flipped around the dial.  And he heard Chris Hansen and decided, I like Chris Hansen.  I'm going to listen to this segment.  I'm sorry.  Hey, listen, man.  I just...  We'll ask Chris...  Frunkus!  No, no, no.  Frunkus.  What are you going to do to her?  Frunkus!  We'll ask Chris Hansen about that clip when it comes in at 8 o'clock, all right? 
[01:11:00]  Can you sign my happy ending book?  Oh, man.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Help us out, Patrice, will you?  You suck.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony, Opie and Anthony, Opie and Anthony, Opie and Anthony, Opie and Anthony.  Hi.  Welcome back to the Opie and Anthony show.  I heard that song before. 
[01:11:30]  What is your song?  This is Rob Zombie.  New Halloween.  Cannot wait.  This is...  Rob Zombie's Halloween?  Nobody's interested?  It'll probably be disappointing.  Oh, I hope not.  I hope not, either.  Looks great.  The anticipation for some of these movies, and then they come out, and you're like...  Transformers lived up to everything, though.  Didn't see it yet.  Transformers.  There was times in that movie where I started to tear up.  Really?  Absolutely.  The nostalgia of that movie. 
[01:12:00]  When Optimus Prime came rolling down the street, I said, boy, a better life.  That was a better time.  A better time.  At school, watching Optimus Prime save the world.  When that part in that movie happened, boy, that movie got me going.  Yeah.  Got me.  That was a great, great movie.  I love that movie.  I just don't go to the movies as much anymore.  Nothing interests me out there.  No, go see the Transformers, man.  I'll watch everything at home.  I'll go see that.  What about I now pronounce you Chuck and Larry? 
[01:12:30]  I'm not going to see that.  Oh, God.  Who would see that?  I'm not going to see that.  Slapsticky.  What about the Black Caddyshack?  Who's your caddy?  I'm not going to see that nonsense, either.  All right.  Very good.  But you know who's silly white boys that make me laugh?  Broken Lizard.  Oh, yeah.  Beerfest.  Yeah, that was funny.  Had me in tears.  I liked Beerfest.  Oh, God.  Broken Lizard makes me laugh.  And Super Troopers was very, very funny.  They're funny dudes, man.  I like that.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Hey, OJ.  We got some good OJ. 
[01:13:00]  OJ.  We were listening to this in the office before the show.  It made us laugh.  It's on, what?  MN1.com?  It's an interview with OJ Simpson, and then we get some prank calls coming in.  Oh, they were taking callers?  What, are they stupid?  What, are they stupid?  They have OJ there for an interview, and they take callers?  First of all, there wouldn't be time for callers.  There'd be, if I was interviewing OJ, it would be the entire time.  If I had an hour to interview OJ, it would be one hour of me asking him everything about 
[01:13:30]  that night.  That's it.  I wouldn't have time to plunk one button down and listen to some dope ask him a question.  OJ, so did you do it?  Click.  That's one of those things you don't need callers.  You just go with it.  Just go.  Now, about the limousine.  The delay between the time that you actually answered the limo after he was beeping.  What were you doing during that period of time?  Right.  And then you just, I want to know everything from his mouth.  Isn't this a man that has been, his life has been destroyed from the court of public opinion? 
[01:14:00]  He's still having a good time.  He's having a great time.  But I'm saying he's done, the court of public opinion has officially made him.  Court of white public opinion?  He's guilty.  Black guys still think he's innocent.  Nah, we never thought he was innocent.  Earl Douglas thinks he's innocent.  Earl's an idiot, but.  I don't think Earl thinks he's innocent.  I think Earl is like, he didn't, he, you know what it is?  Another thing, another secret?  Is that, we just need, we just need white people to do two things. 
[01:14:30]  Admit one, that you're white and you do white things and you've done bad white things and  we just want a little, we just want some kind of apology.  No, there's no apology.  It's over.  But you take all the, but you, if you're not specific, this is the problem.  You're not specific.  I like these little black, white summits we have.  No kidding.  It's like, Patrice is so Patrice and I'm so white.  I'm so me.  You're, you take, you're a white guy.  Yeah.  And you're a white guy.  Yeah.  You don't take your specific whatever you are in the past. 
[01:15:00]  Right.  I'm a black guy.  Yeah.  I take black.  We take a color.  Yeah.  And we verse each other.  We versus each other, whatever, on the fact that we have, we are a color.  So if you're going to take the color that I hate, you have to take the hatred that  I have for the color because it's a vagueness.  So the vague meaning, the vagueness is this.  Like I said, Jews had Hitler.  They had to have somebody.  Black people don't.  We have a color. 
[01:15:30]  And it's not, wasn't even a crime.  Like slavery wasn't even a crime.  We just live with the people that did bad things to us.  And it's a color.  And you love to be in the color.  So just as your color, say, dude, we sorry for that, what we did.  Because we want to be friends.  We want to stop living like this.  As the color, why do I have to be responsible for the color?  Then you should be responsible for every time I turn on the news and see a robbery or  a shooting in Flatbush.  If white people could admit to their wrongness, I think black people will admit to all the 
[01:16:00]  crime and everything.  We had nothing to do with that.  I have no memory of that.  I'm not going to feel guilty for something.  I had nothing to do with it.  But you enjoyed being a white guy.  I love being a white guy.  There is a benefit to the skin color.  You're right.  I'll absolutely say that.  That comes from slavery.  slavery, you are benefiting from the Constitution.  No, I think.  And you're some immigrant.  Where are you from? 
[01:16:30]  Your family's like.  Italian.  Yeah.  A bunch of criminals came in.  Oh, I know.  Believe me.  No way.  And you're German or something.  I'm a mutt.  I'm the American dream.  But you take regular white guys.  I'm a little of everything.  Just apologize.  Just the average white guy.  All right, listen.  Just admit it and we'll stop.  We'll let you have a couple of black people.  OJ, here we go.  MN1.com.  Danny, what do we know about this?  Well, some of our summits got the exclusive with OJ. 
[01:17:00]  Why does this guy get the exclusive with OJ?  It's a woman, isn't it?  Yeah, it is.  It's a woman.  Because no self-respecting journalist would interview OJ.  MN1.com.  What is MN1.com?  It's just like an exclusive, quote unquote, news website.  Why doesn't he go on Hannity?  They won't have him because the host would be crucified for giving him the time of day.  Really?  Yeah.  Is that where we're at?  That's absolutely.  They would love to have OJ.  Are you kidding me?  Any news organization, any reporter would love to sit down and interview OJ. 
[01:17:30]  I think they look past that and they have OJ on their show.  Nope.  The public outrage.  Get Hannity on the phone.  Get Hannity on the phone.  Hannity would take OJ tomorrow if he could.  No, he wouldn't.  No.  You don't think so?  No.  Nope.  Why not?  I think Hannity knows how to spark.  Because Fox would get crazy letters and people protesting saying, why are you giving this  guy the time of day?  Most people don't know that OJ was interviewed.  Why not give him the time of day?  And why, another thing about being accused, I feel bad for the victim, the family, the 
[01:18:00]  family, the victim, is because they always, they don't do their own investigation.  It's just like, you did it, and the cops go, he did it, and the family goes, okay, now  I'm going to put my energy towards the guy who the cops say did it.  But the fact is, like Ron Goldman's dad and all, he thinks OJ did it.  Oh, yeah, but oh, he knows.  He knows.  He knows.  Do you know what the worst day will be in OJ's life? 
[01:18:30]  When Ron Goldman gets cancer.  Finds out he's got a terminal disease.  That's when OJ's got to start hiding.  Because he is going to kill OJ.  Yeah, this is going to end with Fred Goldman killing.  Fred Goldman.  He is upset about, they've stopped his book.  He's not playing around, dude.  No, he's watching everything OJ does his entire life to make sure that if he makes  one dime, that it goes to him.  Yeah, 13 years of that.  And Fred Goldman is going to reach a point, I've lived my life, and then he's going to 
[01:19:00]  go nuts.  Here's this, too.  Let me say this.  If OJ would have fessed up to it back then and said he was enraged at this guy doing this  and I just went crazy, I went over the house to do this and killed them, he'd probably  be out of prison right now.  He would probably be out.  And still hated.  Are you out your mind?  No.  Would you ever...  Did you just hear what you just said?  Yes. 
[01:19:30]  But he wouldn't be...  I don't think he would be...  He should be hated.  He murdered two people.  What's wrong with...  So wait, he gets out.  What's wrong with hating the guy?  I'm not saying...  But I'm saying, why would he go, you know what, why would he appease...  Because now people know...  You can't even apologize to black people.  He got to appease Fred Goldman?  People know he did it, but he got away with murder.  That's what's pissing everyone off.  Not that he killed people.  This is why the country...  This is why we have summits.  I love our summits. 
[01:20:00]  Black people didn't care about OJ either way.  He was loved by you.  I saw the celebrations.  Time out!  The celebrations that you guys didn't care?  We cared because a black dude got away the way white people get away with it.  When white people...  For years, white guys, white juries have been let in white...  And this is what you won't acknowledge!  White people have been getting away with murder?  Yes! 
[01:20:30]  Nigga!  Look.  Oh, damn.  No, you didn't.  Oh, he's standing up.  He's standing up.  No!  No!  Oh!  Oh, boy.  Now he's cursing.  He's standing up.  Who are you going to take out first?  Who are you going to take out first?  This is why...  Who are you going to take out first?  This is Kenny, because I feel comfortable fighting Kenny right now.  That's how mad I am.  How dare you say that?  Name one.  Dude!  Name one.  Spike Lee did a whole film.  Listen, let me tell you something. 
[01:21:00]  This is how wonderful white people are.  Okay.  85-year-old white men are going to jail now for blowing up buildings when they went to court.  The church girls.  Spike Lee did his movie.  Right, right, right.  The Mississippi Burning Dudes.  Oh, we're talking about...  Wait a minute.  They go to jail after...  80 years later because the white jury in Sugar Panties, Mississippi, goes...  Sugar Panties.  They go...  They go...  Not guilty.  With a wink.  Black people are upset about that. 
[01:21:30]  OJ represented a guy who beat the system.  We didn't care about OJ.  Yeah, but friggin' 50 years after the game was over.  Are you...  Oh, you chalk up a victory.  This is why we don't like you.  Do you understand me?  There's OJ running past the end zone 50 years after the game is over.  That stuff went down.  You're absolutely right.  And it was wrong and it was horrid that they got away with the murder.  Don't you understand why our reaction would be that?  But that happened.  It's awful stuff that happened. 
[01:22:00]  And I'm saying this.  Here's why I'm saying this.  I want you to listen to this closely.  Oh, boy.  There was no meeting.  Black people did not call each other and go, ready?  Black folks, here's how you're going to react.  We...  It was a natural reaction and I reacted that way not because, yeah, OJ.  I reacted that way because, oh, he beat the lynching.  He beat...  He beat that.  The juice got him.  And it wasn't about him. 
[01:22:30]  It was about his money.  It was about he got away with murder.  Yeah, but that was...  Because white people do it all the time.  But that wasn't a black-white thing.  That was a money thing.  How come they don't bring to justice...  Okay.  I see lynching pictures with people in it like...  Why don't they bring...  Where they're posing in front of the lynching.  Where they're going like, here's a nigga.  And why don't they find out all the people who was in the lynching picture taking photos  of the hanging black man. 
[01:23:00]  Do you understand why we're mad at you?  You're right.  All right, listen.  I understand that.  Don't do the change-the-subject list in O.P.  You know something?  I'm getting the tranquilizer.  Patrice, I understand that.  That's why we were...  We can't care less about O.J.  You made me understand.  Wow.  That's it.  All right.  You made me understand that.  All right, let's now just have fun.  Can we agree to have a little fun with O.J.?  Yes!  They're interviewing O.J.  I don't give a damn about O.J. 
[01:23:30]  That big-headed...  He got a waterhead.  Go back to that website, by the way.  I don't care about waterhead O.J.  So, this Kate Delaney from MN1.com...  We don't even know where this freaking thing is.  ...gets the exclusive interview with O.J., and a bunch of prank callers got through.  Just messing with her interview with O.J.  Right?  Is that a good enough setup there, Danny?  That's perfect.  All right.  We were laughing pretty good at this.  Listen in.  Guys, let's go to Kevin, I believe, in New Jersey. 
[01:24:00]  Kevin, what's your question for O.J.?  Kevin, what's your question for O.J.?  Hi.  Good show, dude.  My kid Chris was wondering, do you think it was a bigger fee to break?  Slice 2,000 yards in one season, or slice two necks in one night?  I'm having a little trouble, Kevin, hearing you.  Yeah.  I'm freaking O.J.  By the way, we got to...  I didn't hear that last part about the throats.  Yeah, let's start by acknowledging Kid Chris, obviously, on WYSP in Philly. 
[01:24:30]  My kid Chris.  Who did some brilliant O.J. prank calls.  O.J. can get out of anything.  I didn't hear that.  What?  There's something wrong with my headphones.  He heard that.  And Juice is white trained.  Oh, yeah.  Juice is a white guy.  Yep.  He's trained.  He has a black belt in that.  He has a black belt in white.  Excuse me?  What happened?  What?  My headphones.  My headphones.  I can't hear you, man. 
[01:25:00]  He is brilliant.  I'll give him that one.  And has a beautiful white girlfriend.  Of course.  Another blonde.  This guy walks around just oblivious to everything.  He's still living his life like nothing changed.  Yeah.  And his white parents are like, he's going to kill you.  No, he ain't.  The only difference is that the golf course has got a few more bumps on him.  That's about it.  He's still playing golf.  Maybe the balls bounce a little differently because they don't take care of the golf course  as well as he used to play. 
[01:25:30]  Dude, he goes to restaurants and people will yell out, murderer, you're a murderer.  And he stops, smiles.  Hey, how you doing?  He waves.  Hey, hey.  He waves like they're going, O.J., I love you in the Hertz commercials.  O.J. thinks it's 1978.  It's just amazing.  Yeah, I know.  Hey.  That's the best.  He doesn't hear it.  He doesn't hear nothing.  It's the best part of this whole thing.  O.J., you're a killer.  You're a murderer.  You should burn in hell.  How you doing?  You want my autograph?  I said, O.J., just go and eat.  Just go and eat. 
[01:26:00]  You murderer.  I don't use salt.  That gives you a high blood pressure.  No, no, no.  What?  No.  Just having dinner with my girlfriend.  Looks just like the one I killed.  You never saw acting like this when he was doing the Hertz commercials or the police.  There he is running through the airport.  The police academy movies or whatever.  What was it called?  The police squad.  The police squad movies.  No, no.  He fooled you.  Naked gun.  Naked gun.  Naked gun from the files of police squad.  You didn't see acting like that when he was doing naked guns.  He fooled everybody. 
[01:26:30]  Here's more prank callers getting into the O.J.  There's O.J. running through the airport.  I got to get to Chicago to cut my finger on an ashtray.  We got to move through this because we got Chris Hansen, big star, waiting in the green  room to catch a predator.  All right.  Alex is listening to us in Ohio.  Hey, Alex.  Yes.  Hey, Alex.  Hey, how you doing?  Not bad.  Can you hear me, Juice?  Yes, I can hear you, buddy.  Yeah.  Remember when you played for the 49ers?  Yeah. 
[01:27:00]  Yeah.  Did you kill Bill Walsh?  Uh, this is Steve from, uh, How you doing?  Not too bad, Steve.  Uh, it was reported back during the famous, uh, chase, you know, that went on in 94.  Yes.  It was reported on CBS 3 here in, uh, near in Philadelphia that, uh, by Larry Mentee that  you were squeezing your helmet.  That I was what?  I was what?  Hey, for everyone in Philly, you better listen to Kid Chris today on, uh, WISP. 
[01:27:30]  I have a feeling that this is all.  Oh, yeah.  I was what?  I can't hear you again.  Let's continue at the interview.  Ask me about my Heisman trophy.  Right.  He's just hoping a Heisman question comes up.  Did you kill Bill Walsh?  That was genius.  Remember when you played for the 49ers?  Did you kill Bill Walsh?  That was genius.  For a second, he might have been thinking, oh, good, a football question.  Right.  No.  Oh, no.  And he is the greatest runner of all time, by the way. 
[01:28:00]  Oh, of course he is.  Oh, he was beautiful to watch.  What about James?  James, huh?  Brown.  Hmm?  James Brown?  Jim Brown?  I mean, Jim Brown.  Oh, Jim Brown?  Jim Brown was fantastic.  Best football player ever lived.  But, uh, Juice is just beautiful.  Watch one.  All right, here we go.  One more.  Hey, how are you doing?  Not good, Brett.  Hey, OJ.  You know, I had a question for you.  You know, with everything that Michael Vick has been going through and being indicted,  I was just wondering if you wanted to meet me on the Jersey Shore to do live.  There we go.  You know, you're going to get jokers, but that's the great thing. 
[01:28:30]  It's just why do.  No, I don't mind.  I mean, you know, people can say what, if it's negative or what, as long as they're serious  about the question they're asking, it's easier to tell a joke, but it don't bother me.  It don't bother me.  I don't mind the joking about me killing people.  I want to know what Bill Walsh is just one of the greatest things I've ever heard.  What was cut off, though, about the Jersey Shore?  I don't know.  What was the lie?  I should have let him go.  I should have let him go.  Freaking OJ.  I could listen to OJ every single day.  Who couldn't? 
[01:29:00]  That's what I'm saying.  If he would have fessed up.  Now, I think you got my point wrong about that.  If he would have fessed up to the murders and actually served some time and then gotten  out, I think he would have been more accepted in society as somebody who killed people  in a rage, depending on how the trial went and what his money, he could have been made  to look like the victim.  Crime of passion?  Yeah, crime of passion.  He gets out and he builds from there.  People wouldn't look at him like, this guy got away with murder. 
[01:29:30]  No, not the brutality of it, the whole thing.  He might as well have gotten away with it like he got.  And it just doesn't make any sense to admit that you did that by mistake.  And this is one of the things for years.  I just accepted like, ah, Juice did it because I'm tired of the whole thing.  Crimes of passion, you just don't do what he did in a passion rage.  You just don't do that. 
[01:30:00]  You know what I'm saying?  But that kind of is like a crime of passion thing.  You go ballistic.  Oh, wait, I'm sorry.  Let me back up.  I'm sorry about that.  You don't, you don't, like the whole thing was he planned to do that.  I don't think you plan to just go chop people up.  Like when you go, okay, here it is.  I'm going to kill some people.  And here's my plan.  To just go, ah, and cut them both up and then hide.  So if he did do it, oh, Jesus, that's my blackness. 
[01:30:30]  If he did do it.  I'm tired of defending him.  That's great.  It's possible.  I don't know.  Oh, come on.  That is so great.  It is.  It is.  All right.  At least you made it.  Even that's from Bayshore.  Sorry, I couldn't hear that.  This is OJ.  Sorry, I couldn't hear that.  The sound of Nicole's screams are still ringing in my ears.  Oh, God.  Yeah, could you repeat that question?  I have a horrible screaming that never goes away in my head.  And he's outliving everybody.  Oh, I know. 
[01:31:00]  They're dropping like flies.  And then Kardashian's daughter's a whore.  OJ's daughter's losing her mind.  Yeah.  Cochran died.  Cochran died.  Yep.  I think Charles Darden is selling crack in Washington Square Park.  And he is living a better life than everybody.  Proving there's no God.  Hey, TMZ is saying that OJ will guest on that same show the rest of the week.  All right.  MN1.com is the website. 
[01:31:30]  Calls to OJ, I'm sure.  Hey, may we jump on board with this one as well.  Have a little fun with this.  You think that white woman has a taxi petition between them while she's interviewing them?  All right, listen.  Chris Hansen's next.  We've got to take a break here.  Patrice O'Neill in for Jimmy Norton.  Jimmy's going to be on Jimmy Kimmel tonight.  Let's remember that, okay?  It's Opie and Anthony.  Swallow, swallow. 
[01:32:00]  All right.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Very excited today.  We've got Chris Hansen.  Yes.  From To Catch a Predator.  Mm-hmm.  That show is beyond huge.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, obviously.  He's been on our show a couple times, on the phone, in studio.  Yep.  Let's get him in here.  Sure.  Chris Hansen, everybody.  Oh, Steve's going to get him.  Oh, okay.  They're doing marathons now on MSNBC. 
[01:32:30]  Nine to four in the morning.  Yeah, love it.  Got a little surprise for him.  Hey, how are you?  Good.  Why don't you take a seat over there, Chris?  I know that was coming.  Enjoying the cookies and lemonade?  Well, you know we had brownies at the last...  Take a seat.  Brownies, did you?  Brownies.  Exactly.  So, uh, what are you doing here?  I just came to be on the Opie and Anthony show.  On the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:33:00]  Well, yeah.  I've been here before.  You've been here before.  So you've done this before.  No, you're supposed to say, it's not your first time.  So it's not your first time.  Um, I have a few, uh...  You have transcripts.  Transcripts.  Of things that, um, well, let's listen to them together and see if you recognize any of  these.  Is this you, Chris?  I'm not going to avoid the subject. 
[01:33:30]  I would like to make love to you after we are done boot shopping.  I have a serious fetish for boots.  Do you have a fetish for boots?  Is that what you were, uh, saying in this, uh...  This is like the, uh, you know, being put on the spot here.  It's the, the...  I, uh, well, you did say that, didn't you?  I believe that's your voice.  Do we have another, uh, clip for Chris?  I can't control my horny level.  I want to blank your brains out.  I can't help it.  You know, when I read that back, that particular potential predator, there was something in  the back of my mind that said, you know, that could come back to haunt me. 
[01:34:00]  Well, so you're saying you've read this bet?  Before.  This was in reference to a 15-year-old girl.  Well, it was.  I think we have one more clip.  Uh, Chris, is this you?  Remember, sex is a little nasty.  I don't want your dad to find stuff in his bed.  Chris, you're, you're a responsible journalist.  And now you understand your life is ruined.  I'd like to, uh, bring our camera crew out here. 
[01:34:30]  You do realize this is on video.  You're supposed to say, there's something I've got to tell you.  We're Opie and Anthony.  We're on 92.3 KROG.  He invented this game.  Yeah, but he's so damn good at it.  Yeah, but he's sweating a little bit.  Just a little bit.  You can hear it.  You know, we usually shoot these investigations at night.  You know, I have a whole day to prepare.  I'm sorry.  Our camera crew's not as, uh, you know, big as yours.  No, exactly.  I love when they come out with the boons, too.  That's fantastic.  Oh, you gotta hear everything.  Well, uh, Chris Hanson.  Wait, can we play the last one? 
[01:35:00]  Oh, what?  Is there more?  Well, we had a whole bunch, but this one, we just gotta play.  All right, let's hear this one.  We'd be hearing, uh, Chris Hanson say this.  You are ready to have my thang in your...  Oh, Jesus.  Was that a black dude?  Uh, well, it was typed off as a thang.  But I'm saying the way he had to add thang.  Thang.  Well, he's just reading the transcripts as they come out.  Exactly.  Yeah.  It is what it is.  But he, his monotone, um, non-attached reading style left at the thang. 
[01:35:30]  You don't want to sound like it's titillating.  Dick, baby.  But here, here's the thing, you know, a lot of times, you know, I'm talking to these guys  and they, they're not very, uh, vocal and sometimes the best way to get them to talk  is to go back and read the transcripts.  Right, right.  And so, and I read them, you know, verbatim.  Right.  And we try to balance, you know, showing people what these guys are capable of doing and not  trying...  Yeah, we get one of the black dudes, the soul shake, like the, the extra black, like he 
[01:36:00]  was like, what's up, man?  And gave you the thing.  You just follow along with the...  No, but I did, in the last investigation, I did get a...  And then you gave him a round.  The fifth time.  This was the guy who was the fan of yours.  Yeah, yeah.  Hey, hey, hey.  We've been playing...  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  I can turn this around.  He invented it.  I'm telling you.  Dirty new way.  I'll let this go so long.  I'll flip this around.  Yeah.  Wait a minute.  We're still arguing the fact that this guy was an actual fan of our show. 
[01:36:30]  Oh, God.  It's so true.  We have a lot at stake here.  Wow.  We think he might have been a casual listener.  Casual?  Oh, no, no.  Oh, no.  This guy came in, and he had the conversation with the on-site decoy in this most recent investigation,  and she was brilliant because she could really engage these guys.  So not only did we see this online grooming and this contact, we saw this play out in real  time, and these guys were saying, I'm going to do this, I'm going to do that.  And so this happens, and it comes time for me to walk out, and he says, you're Chris Hansen. 
[01:37:00]  And I said, how did you know that?  He goes, I'm a religious viewer.  I never miss an episode.  I pull them off the internet.  And before I can formulate the next question, he says, oh, and I heard you on Opie and Anthony.  You're pretty good.  And I'm like, do you get the trouble?  Yeah.  Don't you understand this isn't a meet and greet?  Yeah.  You're pretty much screwed here?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Can I ask you a question, Chris?  Absolutely.  Why don't you, I watch the show.  Matter of fact, they do marathons now. 
[01:37:30]  Like, they used to do lock-up, they changed it to, it's predator tonight.  Yeah.  And I used to love lock-up.  Lock-up's gone.  Yeah.  Let's do this.  Let's figure this out.  The age 13, 14, all right?  There's so many guys that get caught that there has to be something about that age that  has to be a teetering age.  Can you lower the age to nine so that it is exactly...  Wait a minute.  Are you insane?  So that you know...  He's wearing a tie.  Because there's so many dudes that come in to this 13 is not stopping people. 
[01:38:00]  Patrice, that's supposed to show that there's a problem here.  Yes.  Not the fact that you lower the age to get these guys off the hook.  No, no, no.  Not to get them off the hook.  See, I was with you if you said 15.  Wait a minute.  No.  Jesus.  Lower the age to nine.  Let me make sure you understand this.  He's in shock over there.  Listen to this.  Listen.  I don't care if Chris is in shock.  Listen to this.  Stop being a journalist for a second.  Clearly. 
[01:38:30]  Meaning that the perverted justice people lower the decoy age to something fouler than 13.  You know, I understand what I'm saying.  13 is foul.  Don't try to back me into a corner.  I'm not backing you into a corner.  13 is an arguable age.  I'm going to tell you why.  I talked to my girlfriend the other day.  I said, when did you have sex?  She said 13 is when I first had sex with a 17-year-old guy.  I said, did you feel like you were raped?  Did you feel like you was taking advantage of it? 
[01:39:00]  She said, no.  I just wanted to have sex.  So I'm saying there's a few 13-year-olds that are having sex, I think, not under the coercion.  Yeah, but they don't want with 30-year-old guys.  I know, but make the age 9 so you go, ah, because people are going 14.  But people are saying, ah, to 13.  Let Chris answer.  The law is the law.  And the reality is this, and I understand your point, but I think from the decoy's point of view, 
[01:39:30]  when perverted justice does this, they try to set up the most realistic scenario.  And you would see, most often, I think, a scenario where a 13 or 14-year-old could conceivably be home alone,  where perhaps a 9-year-old may not be.  And they're also trying to keep it sexy and hot.  To keep it, this is what I'm saying here, to keep it coming.  So that if you lower it to 9, dudes that do that, you go, let's work our way from the bottom bottom. 
[01:40:00]  Because 13 and 14, basically what he's saying, it's an appealing age to come for dudes to be like, ugh, 14.  Well, it seems to be the age that a lot of these girls and guys, these predators,  are using the computer and communicating with each other, are mostly in that age bracket.  Well, I think that's the age bracket that these potential predators target.  Because those are kids who are online, and they're curious.  Right.  And, you know, they're out there in the social networking sites and in the chat rooms. 
[01:40:30]  So, you know, naturally they become the targets.  Yeah.  Yeah, they're going for where the targets are.  That's all.  Why aren't you drinking our lemonade?  I wouldn't drink that either.  The cookies are good.  God knows where the interns got it.  Exactly.  We didn't poison the cookies.  He's smart.  He's a smart man.  I haven't survived this long.  Yeah.  By being on the show.  I saw, I've been watching MSNBC, and on the weekends, it is just, I was talking about  this the other day, I don't know how it's affecting people, but it is murder weekend. 
[01:41:00]  It is just murder weekend.  Every weekend you can see murders and then how they catch the people.  And I'm fascinated by this.  And I saw one that you actually did a story on.  And it was a while ago.  You were adorable.  You must have been very young in your younger days.  It was that double jeopardy case.  Oh, it was the Mel Ignato.  Oh, my God.  Down in, uh...  Was that the...  That one is unbelievable.  That was the twins you were telling me about? 
[01:41:30]  No, this was the one where a man...  Down in Louisville, Kentucky?  Yeah, in Kentucky.  He murdered his wife.  Correct.  And he had some girlfriend accomplice help him out.  They photographed this murder and took some of her jewelry, did horrible things to her  before they murdered her.  Wait, so they murdered her and they took all sorts of pictures.  Yeah.  As he was having sex with her and murdering her. 
[01:42:00]  And they could never find these pictures or the missing jewelry.  And that's what the case really hinged on with the jury.  But how do they know there's pictures?  Well, somebody else...  The woman rolled.  What happened was they tried this guy and basically he got off.  And some years later, as I recall, he sold the house and the people came in to re-carpet.  Yeah, pulled up the carpet.  They pulled up the carpet.  Right, and in one of the areas where there was a ventilation, they found some canisters 
[01:42:30]  of undeveloped film.  And they developed this film and it is photographic evidence of the actual murder.  Wow.  And they couldn't...  It's double jeopardy.  So they got him on a perjury charge.  Right, they did.  50-year perjury charge.  He's out.  I think they tried.  They got him like eight years.  But he's out now.  And whenever a camera approaches him, he just starts quoting gospel and he's born again.  So he doesn't address it. 
[01:43:00]  He just goes, you know, the Lord will be my judge.  Do you ever get scared of Max Katie stuff, Chris?  Like, first, do you have police in there?  That's what we were discussing before.  Do you have people in there in case a dude goes, you mother...  I'm going to knock you out right now.  We have a very detailed security protocol that we have.  And so it's tailored to each individual location.  And whether we're doing a predator thing or whether we're doing iPod theft or ID theft  and we're in West Africa, I mean, we have a team in place.  So I feel pretty comfortable.  Oh, I saw that. 
[01:43:30]  You know, you can fight, can't you?  Well, you know, I grew up in Detroit.  You can fight.  All right.  He can take care of himself.  That's all he needs to say.  And here's another thing I like to ask.  And sometimes I get a little bored watching you just catch it.  Could you do something just like have a...  When the guys come up, have a 50-year-old woman answer the door and just have the guys  just go, wait a minute.  Yeah, we want bloopers.  You ain't 13?  We want some bloopers.  It's not really a show conducive to comedy.  We want bloopers.  We want Benny Hill music.  I don't think you can really turn it to spin it funny. 
[01:44:00]  You old.  Hey, I saw the scam show also.  That was great from the Nigerian scammers.  And when you get the guy running down the street, you must have known that was going to  be funny.  He was moving fast.  Can you explain?  I didn't see this.  These are the guys, investigators call it the Nigerian scams.  Sure.  And they get you online.  Hi, I'm so-and-so and so-and-so.  And I need your help.  I've got $38 million, but I need you to put up $10,000 and give me a bank account. 
[01:44:30]  And people fall for this stuff all the time.  It's amazing.  There was a treasurer in Michigan who invested not only his own money, but some county funds  in this thing, thinking that he was alluring.  It's just like these people get drawn in and these sweetheart swindles online.  People are lonely.  They spend time in these chat rooms.  And they develop these relationships.  And these other kind of predators prey on their emotions.  And that wins over the intellect.  And suddenly, they're carving checks.  But we had this guy who we had been in contact with, and I was posing as Rich Greenback. 
[01:45:00]  Yes, Rich Greenback.  He had money that were all money names.  It was really funny.  Jimmy Da Money.  Jimmy Da Money was one of my favorites.  My producer, in this case, Tim Muellinger, who's a great, great guy.  He found this pub in London.  And the ruse was that I was part owner of it, and that's where we had to have the meeting.  Well, they always want to get you into their territory, but we wanted to get them into ours.  So the guy comes in, and he's looking around, and we sit down, and we have the meeting. 
[01:45:30]  I said, look, we have a little problem with the funds transfer, but here's $500, and we'll get back later in the day.  And so we're back and forth, and we meet him in different locations in London.  And we look at Rolls Royces that I'm going to buy.  Once this money comes in, we're sitting in it, and we're all comfy.  So the final guy comes back, and I confront him.  I mean, I lower the boom.  I said, look, I know that you're trying to rip me off.  And this guy is sweating profusely.  And we're in this pub.  And he looks up, and he says, can I get a beer?  I need a little bracer to take the edge off.  He starts drinking. 
[01:46:00]  He confronted one guy on the street and pretty much told him, you know, I know you're trying to scam people.  And the guy just turned and started running away.  And you're just standing in the street going, excuse me, do you want to talk?  But you feel like running can make anything go away if you run fast enough.  And the best part is how you ask him, could I have my $500 back?  And the guy goes, yeah.  Actually gives him the $500 back.  Yeah, the finance people were so happy because I got this money back each time.  Yeah, it was great.  Are you at the top of your, like what you do in the news world? 
[01:46:30]  Is that, like, is it more prestigious to be Bill O'Reilly, be you, be, you know, Oberman or something?  It's just different.  You know, I've always enjoyed investigative reporting.  You know, when I was 14 years old, I lived a mile away from the restaurant where Jimmy Hoffa was kidnapped.  And I became enthralled with this whole story.  And I saw the network show up and the FBI was there.  And it just, you know, I got bit by the bug then.  So I've always enjoyed this sort of reporting.  If they offered you Stone Phillips job, would that be something you'd go, ooh, I would love to do that? 
[01:47:00]  Or you'd be like, I'd rather stay doing what I'm going to say.  It's not going to say no.  I've got, you know, I've got a great gig, to be honest with you.  And they let me do the kinds of stories I like to do.  And one of the things that has come out of the Predator investigations is it has been a reminder that this kind of enterprise reporting,  this kind of impact journalism is not only something that people are interested in, that people watch, but it makes a difference.  It creates a dialogue.  It raises awareness.  And it's, quite frankly, engaging for me.  You know, it's interesting. 
[01:47:30]  You know, I love going to work.  I love, you know, who gets to go on a plane and go to West Africa and track down some ID thieves?  Who gets to do that?  Right.  It's got to be like, even though, you know, you're doing something for the greater good, let's say, you know, getting these people off the streets.  It's got to feel good personally at a personal, just a basic human level where you go, I'd love to get my hands on this guy that's doing this.  Like when I read those scam emails, I want to write back and just go, who do you think you're kidding? 
[01:48:00]  Do you?  I'm insulted that you sent me this, that you think I'm so stupid.  And you get to confront these guys.  And above and beyond that, you know, I work with some really smart, talented people.  I mean, the producers with whom I work get it on every level.  And they're not only bright journalists, you know, they're good pals.  And so, you know, I have it pretty good.  Why is the show so popular, do you think?  The To Catch a Predator?  Yeah.  You know, it's a combination of things.  It's this knowledge that these guys are out there. 
[01:48:30]  And most people only see it on this anonymous, nameless, faceless genre, you know, where it's just text.  And we bring this to life.  And so you see the face of this guy walk in, and he's not a guy that has the word predator tattooed on his forehead.  He looks like the guy standing next to you at the dry cleaners on Saturday morning.  And I think it's surprising to people that Joe Average, you know, would not only engage in this explicit discussion, which is in most states illegal in itself,  but to walk into a stranger's home, in a suburb, into a $3 million house, on the Jersey Shore, on the beach. 
[01:49:00]  The beach ones are hilarious.  No big deal.  The beach ones are hilarious, but the girl just sitting there just happens to have two beach chairs set up.  I was watching that over the weekend.  I think another compelling thing about the show is the fact that you're not seeing the people in cuffs, in a mug shot.  Right.  You're seeing it taking place as it's happening.  And that was what was so compelling about the last investigation was this, you know, Casey, our decoy, who, you know, 18-year-old college student, theater, dance, who looks... 
[01:49:30]  She really looks the part.  She looked 13.  It was amazing.  Come on in here!  But she was really smart, and she had the ability to engage these guys in a way that we had not seen before, and I think it was startling to people to see this real-time, live grooming process take place.  After the first time, did you go, this will, okay, after you did it the first time, did you go, this will, man, we might as well make the best of this, because this will never be able to be done again. 
[01:50:00]  And you're like, wait a minute, every week we're getting 15 dudes to come see?  I figured we'd do it, you know, two, maybe three times.  When we went to Riverside County, California, which is the first time we did our investigation and law enforcement did a parallel investigation, I really sort of thought, wow, you know, what are the odds that we're going to have anybody walk into this house?  You know, we may come back with nothing but video of me pacing in a kitchen like the Maytag repairman, and this is the one where we had 51 guys show up. 
[01:50:30]  51?  Why?  Guys are running into each other.  We had a guy, a Homeland Security agent, we had a teacher, we had, I mean, guys from all walks of life.  Can I ask you a statistical question?  Sure.  Okay, we see the guys on your show.  Right.  How many dudes and how many teenage girls, how many times is this scenario that you're playing out with perverted justice happening?  In real life?  Yeah.  That's not getting caught.  It's impossible to tell because of the nature of the internet. 
[01:51:00]  You know, the Justice Department really doesn't have good figures on this.  I mean, they can tell you how many murders take place in any given city.  They can tell you the recidivism rate for any given crime.  But you can't track this stuff.  You know, we know anecdotally that we can go into any city in America and have this happen.  But in terms of how often it really happens, nobody really knows.  I mean, that's the nature of the internet.  And you keep it at the letter of the law, like earlier you go, hey, it's the law. 
[01:51:30]  Now, is there something where you ever discuss in your own mind or to people like where you go, okay, here's the age.  Because there's a lot of Indian dudes on your show.  And they're shocked.  And, you know, I do stand-up and I talk to Indian dudes.  And the age is something ridiculous over there, where they're from.  And they go, what, 14?  That's old.  I think that the people who come into the house reflect the population of the city we're in and the professions.  If we're near a military base, we'll see more military guys. 
[01:52:00]  If we're, you know, near Silicon Valley, we'll see guys in there.  No, I know what you're doing now.  I'm not making it a racial question.  No, but there's no...  I'm making it a law question, like a moral, like say there's no law.  Right.  There's no standard of law in an age that you just make up and decide.  But in this country, the law is the law.  The law is the law.  But I'm saying, is there like a thing where you guys go, where you go, it's like say if it was 16, the law was 17 in the state you're in.  And then you send out a 16-year-old thing and guys are coming out to see a 16-year-old. 
[01:52:30]  But the law is 17 where you are.  So are you going to have the same outrage or the same disgust that the dude that's doing the 16-year-old thing?  I think that the protocol for perverted justice decoys is that, you know, they wouldn't even set up that scenario because it would be, you know, it wouldn't be illegal.  It wouldn't be, you know...  No, I mean, like if 16 was...  A little marginal call right there.  Like I was reading this thing, I think California is like 16.  Let's go to Mike in Jersey.  This comes up a lot.  Mike, go ahead. 
[01:53:00]  We got Chris Hansen on our show.  How you doing, guys?  Notice how he said shut up.  Yeah.  Did you notice that?  All right, what's your question?  Well, I think it's entrapment.  I think it's wrong.  I mean, say...  I don't think he means...  Dude, dude, calm down for a second.  I don't...  Wait a minute.  I don't think he meant set up as in setting them up.  I think he meant the scenario and because cameras, police, things have to be set up, houses...  Yeah.  But, you know, so he's not saying he's trying to entrap the people. 
[01:53:30]  He's saying the scenario, he's not going to set up a 16-year-old scenario.  I know the guys are scumbags, but it's still entrapment.  You must get that a lot.  Yeah.  Here's the entrapment...  Here's why it's not.  And it's because when the perverted justice decoys go into the chat rooms, they simply  have a profile, which includes a picture that's unmistakably underage, and they sit  and wait.  They never make the first move.  It's always the potential predator who makes the first move.  And isn't it the intent that is the crime?  That's why a lot of people say, well, I was role-playing. 
[01:54:00]  Right.  It varies from state to state, the laws do, but in a lot of states, the online solicitation  in and of itself could constitute a felony.  Regardless of who's on the other end.  Well, if it's somebody who they believe is underage.  I mean, you know, the police do sting operations all the time, and the decoy is not always, you  know, a 12 or 13-year-old kid. 
[01:54:30]  But that's how these people are calling them.  So, hey, we're running out of time here.  We want to promote the, you're doing something on Dateline there, Chris?  Tonight at 10 Eastern, we are doing an investigation into iPod theft.  And we didn't realize what a problem this was until one of our senior producer's sons had  his iPod stolen.  So we decided to go out and see if we could track these things and who was taking them.  So we bought about 20 iPods, and we inserted it into the package software. 
[01:55:00]  So whoever ended up with this thing would register with Apple and register with us.  So then we had this 32-foot RV, right?  And it's outfitted like a predator house, hidden cameras and everything.  And it's got a banner on the side saying, music giveaway.  And so when we'd identify where one of these things was, we'd pull up, and the producer  would get out with balloons and a camera crew, a la Prize Patrol, knock on the door and  say, you know, you're eligible for this free music giveaway, this music download card.  And they'd come into the RV, and I'm sitting there, and I'd sit down and I'd ask them, 
[01:55:30]  where'd you get it?  Best Buy, Circuit City, you know, cash or credit card, right?  What kind of music do you have on it?  And for 20 minutes, go on and say, there's a video I want you to see.  And of course, there's a monitor up there.  And then the video is, in some cases, of them stealing the actual iPod.  And it goes back around to the question, should Apple do more?  Could it do more?  You know, what's the responsibility to track these things, given the fact that, you know,  this eye-jacking, as it's called, is epidemic?  You know what I'm thinking?  So the guy goes into the RV, he sees you, like, oh, no!  Oh, no, I didn't talk to him! 
[01:56:00]  And then I was like, oh, he got me because I stole an iPod?  He's like, oh!  They see you, like, no!  I'm not trying to say that iPod theft is the same as...  Yeah, but as soon as they see you, though, they're like, they're in a panic, like, oh, no!  And people would come in and say, hey, you look like that, Chris.  I said, you know, I get that all the time.  I get that all the time.  They're pretty much relieved that you got them for an iPod and freaking theft instead of the other one.  But it's really a fun...  Yeah, it sounds like a lot of...  And also, you've got a book out there, right? 
[01:56:30]  Absolutely.  It's on the whole predator issue, the enemy already in your home.  And, you know, I took all these experiences that I've had and, you know, looking in the eyes of some 300 of these guys  and talked to some of the experts in this field and distilled this information for parents.  They'll help keep their kids safe online.  It's called To Catch a Predator, Protecting Your Kids from Online Enemies Already in Your Home.  Before we go, though, I've got to ask you if you're allowed to talk about the lawsuit at all that's against the network.  Look, I can tell you this.  You know, I'm a little limited because the lawsuit's actually been filed. 
[01:57:00]  But, you know, the lawyers have gone through the claims.  They're without merit, and NBC's going to defend itself vigorously.  You know, I mean, anybody can file a lawsuit, and they don't have to verify the things that are in it.  It's a guy that apparently took his life because he was caught in one of the—  Oh, the DA.  Yeah.  I was actually—I ain't going to lie to you.  You know, the DA.  I was like, good.  Good for you.  Because he was one of the dudes that helped set up the whole thing, supposedly. 
[01:57:30]  Well, it is kind of ironic, isn't it?  The family, right?  Yeah.  All right, listen, we've got to break.  We're running out of show here.  Chris Hanson, it's always a pleasure.  Guys, thanks for having me.  I appreciate it.  Always a pleasure, man.  I'm really mad you didn't drink any of our lemonade or even try the cookies.  I need some coffee.  You got some coffee, though.  Tonight, it's on Dateline.  Chris tracks down stolen iPods and confronts the thieves in a hidden camera investigation.  10 o'clock tonight on NBC.  Well, Chris, you know now you're free to go.  I think you know it's waiting for you outside.  Thanks so much, man.  Always a pleasure having you on, man. 
[01:58:00]  Thanks for having me.  I appreciate it.  All right, we'll wrap up the show next.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hey, this is Jim Norton.  I'll be doing a book signing for Happy Endings this Friday, August 3rd at the Borders Books  and Music 34300 Woodward.  It's in Birmingham, Michigan, and it's 730.  I'll be signing Happy Endings this Friday, August 3rd, 730 at Borders 34300 Woodward in Birmingham,  Michigan.  So come, and I'll take pictures if you want. 
[01:58:30]  The Opie and Anthony Show will be broadcasting live from the XM compound in Washington, D.C.,  Thursday, August 16th, and Friday, August 17th, just before the traveling virus, Saturday,  August 18th at the Nissan Pavilion.  God help us all.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Today, it's Opie and Anthony, Patrice O'Neill.  Chris Hansen was great, wasn't he?  That was fun.  We're going to make a video of that. 
[01:59:00]  I mean, Anthony doing Chris Hansen to Chris Hansen with the lemonade and the cookies,  playing his transcripts.  I'm telling you, we got a great video.  I think he was a little shook up at the beginning.  I heard in his voice, like, oh my, oh, this is how it is to be on the other side.  So this is how it feels.  We have the lemonade and cookies out for him.  Sam's going to work on the video.  We should have it in a couple hours.  I think break.com will throw it on their front page.  And I'm glad he didn't drink the lemonade or eat the cookies, because I wouldn't even do that. 
[01:59:30]  The podium yesterday had pubes on it.  All right.  You're right.  I don't think we need food to be given to our guests when that's the pubic podium.  You're right.  I'm just excited we might have a viral video.  Maybe.  Everyone's about making that viral video.  Let's be honest with each other.  Exactly.  And we think we got one that might get a few hits now, if Sam cuts it up nice.  Maybe.  We're running out of show.  We went pretty late with Chris Hansen. 
[02:00:00]  Oh, we got Rich Voss on the phone?  Oh.  Rich Voss?  Rich Voss?  Rich?  At 50 years old, became a daddy for the third time yesterday.  Hey, Rich.  Hey, what's going on?  Congratulations, buddy.  Thank you.  Another baby girl.  Oh, jeez.  Raina Lynn Voss?  Yes.  Why Raina?  Raina.  Because it's a biblical name and there's no type of religion flowing anywhere through this 
[02:00:30]  house.  So we figured if we give her a biblical name, God might be.  First of all, just say godly.  Yeah.  Biblical.  You're having a tough time.  It's very political.  Jesus-y.  But what does Raina mean in the biblical sense?  I forget.  I think it means queen.  It means Bonnie's career is over.  Thank God.  I think it means never go near someone like Patrice.  Congratulations, Rich.  Where were you during the delivery? 
[02:01:00]  Playing golf.  No.  I was in there.  It was kind of weird because they did a C-section, which I recorded a lot of it.  No.  You did?  Wait.  You were able to get some recording device in there?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  I think I'm looking for a pilot.  See, I've been hearing for years that they don't allow that anymore because Ann and I have  been trying to do this bit.  We'll say it again.  Maybe you can find some old tapes.  We want you to send in video and audio of your wife giving birth and all the hell that goes  on in those delivery rooms. 
[02:01:30]  The screaming, the yelling, the cursing.  Yeah, but not with the C-section.  They cut her up.  They cut Bonnie up, boss.  Oh, thank you, Dr. Patrice.  You know everything, don't you?  I'm saying they sliced her up.  They gave her a slice, but they're good with the slice now, not like the old days.  Well, here's the thing.  You can't bring a video camera in unless it's some Bravo TV show or something.  Right.  And I asked the doctor, can we bring a camera in?  And he said, no, because they're scared of getting sued or whatever.  Who knows?  It's a lawsuit thing.  Absolutely.  And then, a matter of fact, when they gave her an epidural, I had to leave the room. 
[02:02:00]  Because one time, a lady was getting an epidural, and her husband was watching, and he fainted  and hit his head and died.  So, I wasn't even allowed to do that.  Well, so, I go in there, but they didn't say I couldn't bring an audio recorder in.  I brought a stereo recorder.  It was in my pocket the whole time.  Yeah.  And, you know, I listen to some of it. 
[02:02:30]  But, you know, I'll give it to you guys, and we'll edit it and stuff.  But, even when they're giving you a C-section, it's very painful.  Oh, shit.  It's creepy.  What, Ed?  What's that?  We're still on the other side.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I thought we were on the S-caller satellite.  No, Ed said no S.  I said no, and then I used the S-word.  Yeah.  What am I, crazy?  Of course it hurts.  Yeah.  Did you watch her get cut open? 
[02:03:00]  If Voss is on, we're on XM.  Huh?  Like, they have her blocked up with, like, a, you know, a sheet or whatever.  I don't know what they call it.  So, she can't see it.  And I sat behind there.  But, when the baby came out, they said, you know, as they're pulling the baby out, you  know, and even when they cut her stomach open, she was tight.  You know, it was hard to get the baby out.  So, they go, take a look, and I stood up, and it was, it looked like a scene from the  movie Hostel.  Oh.  They cut blood everywhere. 
[02:03:30]  It was.  How big of a cut did they make?  Well, I didn't, I didn't really stare, and I didn't have a tape measure with it.  It's finished.  Six inches.  It was big enough, you know.  To bring a baby out.  And it just looked all cut.  You know, you know, it's like one of those alien movies.  Ew.  Oh, man, that's not right at all.  That's 20 extra minutes for Bonnie.  And then, man.  That's 20 extra minutes for Bonnie.  Yeah.  And you.  Y'all gonna argue over what we just talked about.  So, I had to have a C-section.  Right, girls?  You know how that is.  I just had a baby, ladies and gentlemen. 
[02:04:00]  I gave you a second.  A, B, E, and F section.  Thank you.  That was an old joke of mine.  I didn't hear it, so.  So, and then I didn't, you know, the baby came out.  And it was all gray and blue and ugly.  So, you know.  Boss has 20-year-old daughters and a baby.  And a baby.  This is my 40-year-old big sister.  He's my 80-year-old dad who can't do anything with me.  Play nothing.  He called me yesterday. 
[02:04:30]  I just started laughing.  I'm like, way to go.  You started all over.  He was done.  His daughters are just about out of the house.  And he decided to start all over again.  Daughter's 15.  He's 87.  Please tell him some of your kids.  Open up your suitcase.  Okay?  What?  Oh, God.  I can't be funny.  And he tried to blame it on the fact that he's going through something with his child.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, I am a little old to be having a baby.  And, you know, I was really nervous and I had a lot of anxiety.  You're not a little old. 
[02:05:00]  You make babies.  You're the gun.  Bonnie's too old to be the target.  Well, here's the thing, man.  You know.  You can shoot him off until you're 8,000.  It don't matter for you.  It had to come out of her.  I know.  So don't worry about it.  I know.  Just call me Tony Randall.  No more auditions for her, though, Voss.  Just admit it.  No, man.  Voss told me the whole thing.  The reason they took the baby instead of doing it naturally is because they got, like,  Comedy Central specials they got to film.  Tell them, Voss. 
[02:05:30]  Tell them.  Tell them the real reason why she went in and got cut.  Who's the babysitter?  Lou Wallach?  Tell them.  They got some Comedy Central stuff that they got to be filming.  And then Bonnie can't be all pregnant.  So they took the baby early.  Go ahead, Voss.  Voss is going to plant his daughter and his newborn baby in it and say these lines.  It's so funny how you guys always tell half the truth.  The thing is.  Oh, did you hang up on me? 
[02:06:00]  No.  No, go ahead.  Jesus.  I don't know.  He's freaking out.  A little silence.  And he automatically thinks that we hung up on him.  For once, we're listening to you.  You got a good story to tell.  Let's go.  Well, here's the thing.  Her due date wasn't around now.  Yeah.  So if she, it wasn't around now.  So she went in and tried to be induced.  They tried to be induced.  And I got that on tape with her.  That was a week ago, though.  Yeah.  And the reason you went in a week ago, because you want to give her time to get her body in shape for her taping of her Comedy Central special. 
[02:06:30]  You know it's true.  Right now, she looks like Kathleen Madigan.  Oh, God.  Her and Corey are going to hang out now.  Here's the thing.  Because...  Yeah, that was a good one, Rich.  I know.  I got that one.  The thing is, because if she went in and had to have a C-section, it takes a couple weeks to heal for her to be able to work again.  Okay?  And at the end of the month, we're both doing specials for Comedy Central. 
[02:07:00]  See?  So if she wasn't healed, okay?  So her delivery...  That's great.  You're the worst.  You know, Tiger Woods had a baby recently.  And he basically said, I forgot what tournament it was, that he was going to blow off one of the big ones, you know?  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Voss has been there and done that.  Voss already has adult children.  Tiger Woods was asked, if my wife's going to have the kid, I'm going to blow off a major. 
[02:07:30]  I forgot if it was the U.S. Open or the British Open, but right around that, he said, yeah,  I will blow off this major tournament so I could watch the birth of my child.  He's his first baby.  And Rich is like finagling the birth of his child.  He's like working at Comedy Central.  If you gave him 15 minutes, right, to answer this question, what's more important?  Your 50-year-old man with a career that's...  You need a career or the new baby. 
[02:08:00]  Voss has to think about that for a second.  Right.  First of all, don't compare me to Tiger Woods.  Compare me to like Norton.  If you were going to have a kid, Norton would do a spot at Dangerfields before he had his kid.  Can I plug something?  Yeah, yeah.  Of course.  I'm going to be at DC Improv, August 10th, 11th, and 12th, the District of Columbia.  DC Improv, August 10th, 11th, and 12th.  You got a website where the fans can go now and get these dates?  PatriceOneal.com.  Finally, right?  For a little while.  There was a time where we were like, website, like, I got a guy, but... 
[02:08:30]  He's getting himself into a shape.  Yeah, I'm like Voss.  My career is like Voss having babies at 50.  I'm just trying to get a career at 49.  It's just a little white guilt, because I know you come in here, you kick ass when Jimmy's  away.  We don't pay, yes?  So the least we can do is make sure you get a few extra bodies in the seats, and then  we would ask you, and you're like, I don't have a website.  I know.  What are you going to do?  They'll find me.  See, they don't like people.  You used to say they'll find me.  You see, I still want them to.  See?  All right.  How come...  You got the website, though? 
[02:09:00]  That's good.  All the dates are right there nice, right?  And my podcast is on there.  All right.  And make sure you check out the YouTube video we were talking about earlier.  I mean, it's classic, Patrice O'Neal.  Hey, Rich, congratulations.  Hey, thanks.  Yeah.  Are you going to Detroit?  Yeah, yeah, of course.  Are you kidding me?  I'm doing...  Are you kidding me?  Three days after the birth of his child, he'll be in Detroit with us for the ONA Childly  Virus Conference, you know, this Saturday.  He could have a daughter, and then his kid could have a kid, and he could have a granddaughter  the same age.  Yeah.  Like, just barely months apart. 
[02:09:30]  Oh, yeah.  So, you know, I'm so glad that I woke up with a little self-esteem.  You guys just knocked on that.  Yeah, let's get that.  Get rid of that.  Hey, Rich, was I very nice to you on the phone yesterday?  Yes, and you guys were actually very nice.  Was I a human being on the phone yesterday saying nothing but congrats and give Bonnie our  best and all that?  Hey, let me tell you.  That was, you know...  You were my first non-relative call.  Oh, very nice.  See, you got to hear the real Greg Hughes, the actor that plays Opie on the Opie & Anthony show. 
[02:10:00]  Sounds very political of him to say that to me.  Yeah, really.  First non-relative.  Hey, Rich.  Non-relative.  Rich, all kidding aside, congrats, and we'll see you Saturday in Detroit, all right?  It might be.  All right, I'll talk to you later.  We got to get off this side of the show.  Patrice, always a pleasure, but you're not going anywhere.  Now we go...  Hang out.  Now we go over to XM and curse a little bit.  It's Opie & Anthony.  I will do you whip them out Wednesday.  Wednesday.  Opie & Anthony.  It's the Opie & Anthony Show.  Opie & Anthony.  Opie & Anthony. 
[02:10:30]  I, uh, I'm going to agree with a hater.  You are. 
[02:11:00]  Ecstasy of gold between shows sucks a dirty cock.  I have to agree with a hater today.  In those exact terms.  It doesn't really work.  No.  You're kind of right.  How about the live version of In Memory of Elizabeth Reed?  Yeah, kid, now you're talking!  Can we play that?  How about Trump's in space, Grateful Dead?  Yeah.  Where's my deadhead's at, yo!  Yo, green grass and high tides.  Yo-ho in the same state. 
[02:11:30]  Green grass and high tides.  Forever?  Yes.  Green grass and high tides.  That's how long it'll last.  High tides forever.  I'm talking live version with the long extended guitar solo.  I understand.  There you go.  Freebird live version.  Freebird live, too.  That guitar solo goes on forever.  Wow.  Would that take a while?  What we should attempt to do right now, find three songs, three lousy songs that could get  this to 11 o'clock.  Wow.  Oh, you got one?  Danny's got one?  What?  It's by Yes. 
[02:12:00]  It's the entire first side.  Oh, shit.  It was the whole first side.  Close to the edge.  That's right.  Yeah, you looked at that album, and there were no grooves.  It was just like his black album.  I had a friend, good old Paul.  Tate was his nickname.  He still is his nickname.  He's teaching English in some foreign country.  He tried to get me into Yes, past the beginner Yes, all the hits that most of us know and love.  He would drop acid and do all sorts of shit, and he would try to turn me on to that fucking 
[02:12:30]  first side of that album.  We'd all get-  Yours is no disgrace.  Yours is no disgrace.  Yours is no disgrace.  Dun, dun, dun.  Who the fuck could get their voice that high?  Yours is no disgrace.  Try.  Go ahead.  What?  Try getting your voice that high.  I got to sing along with the music.  Where is it?  Long distance, run around.  Long time, waiting to feel the sound. 
[02:13:00]  Very good.  Do you remember the dream there?  Do you remember the time you said goodbye?  Bye.  This is called the Fuck Patrice Hour.  Yeah, we figured you talked enough.  You don't know Yes?  Go continue your nap.  The white boys are talking.  Thank you, Grandma.  This is Patrice Ume go time. 
[02:13:30]  Rapper's Delight is pretty long.  Ah, yeah.  We can play that.  I want to try this Yes thing a little more.  Anyone else out there-  Stairway to Heaven?  How about we-  It's Sing High Wednesday.  Yeah, how about we involve the listeners?  Can you sing as high as John Anderson?  Ita Gata Davida?  Ita Gata Davida.  See, that one's easy.  I could even do that one.  That's long, isn't it?  Yeah.  Greengrass and High Tides.  Uh, that's the live version, right?  Alright, that's 20 minutes and 58 seconds.  That's 21 minutes.  Alright.  And yes, Close to the Edge is 23 minutes-  17 seconds. 
[02:14:00]  17 seconds.  Alright.  Three songs to 11?  I know, that's gonna be tough.  That's impossible.  Hey, for the hell of it, give us the live version of Freebird.  Let's see what that is.  What kind of pompous asshole puts out a 20 fucking minute song?  Bye-bye, Miss American Pie?  Isn't that like an hour and a half?  That's a fucking nothing compared to this.  Bye-bye.  I thought that was like-  Eight minutes tops, bro.  How about the Edmund Fitzgerald?  There you go.  I got one.  That's seven minutes.  Give me Alice's Restaurant.  Oh, shit.  Give me Alice's Restaurant. 
[02:14:30]  Oh, no, you didn't.  Oh, yeah, I did.  How long is that?  I'm home.  So we went to Alice's Restaurant.  Did you?  I used to be old school Genesis, too, John, in Montreal.  Supper's ready.  And we took brooms and rakes and shovels and other implements of destruction.  Did you?  Shut the fuck up.  Thanks for coming.  Enough already.  Wow, that's 22 minutes?  That's it?  Fuck.  We can only come up with like an hour.  A little over an hour. 
[02:15:00]  Three songs an hour.  All right.  A three-fer.  Let's play a three-fer.  Dude, we used to fuck up everybody just today.  Oh, that would kill the audience.  Hey, Lee Abrams always tells me to think out of the box.  This is thinking out of the box, everybody.  Three Birds, a mere 13 minutes, 39 seconds.  What the fuck is that about?  Are you sure that's the live version?  It's live, yeah.  Yeah.  Pink Floyd Echoes, 20 plus minutes, yes.  Yes.  Adam Heart Mother by Pink Floyd.  There's got to be a ridiculous Emerson, Lake, and Palmer song, isn't there? 
[02:15:30]  Maybe.  Can you Google Longest Songs?  Oh.  Very good.  Fans on the motherfucker.  Look at him.  Typing away.  Echoes, 23 minutes.  Fuck.  23.  Wow.  Come on.  23, 22.  So far, that's the record right now.  Yeah.  Pink Floyd.  Wow.  That's a long one.  What is this?  Jethro Tull, Thick as a Brick, live? 
[02:16:00]  I don't know.  It's got to be, Thick as a Brick, 2237.  Thick as a Brick, the song we've heard a million times on the radio, is not the way it was supposed  to be heard.  Are you shitting me?  They threw that into a three minute edit.  What's the original version of Thick as a Brick?  Find it on an album.  I'm not even talking to live.  2237.  Is that live though?  I don't know.  It says Thick as a Brick, 2237.  I'm telling you, I read this somewhere.  Fucking Tull was pissed off because this was his masterpiece, and then Rock Radio.  Fuck these idiots and their masterpieces. 
[02:16:30]  It's self-serving, pompous douchebag.  But Rock Radio took it and just made it into a four minute song to fit nicely into their  thing.  Good for them.  But the original, I guess, is...  Didn't the Beatles do something ridiculously long?  No.  Off the White Album.  Fuck this 22 minute shit.  Number nine.  Let's get a song over 22 minutes.  Thick as a Brick is 22 minutes long, the original version.  Isn't that amazing?  Well, I can't find one over Pink Floyd.  23-22 seems to be the record for a long song right now. 
[02:17:00]  How about some concerto?  I bet you a doggy-o for the strings is 10 hours.  Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence by Dream Theater, 43 minutes.  Yeah, but Dream Theater you can't even acknowledge as a band.  I'm sorry.  When is the longest song?  Fuck Dream Theater.  They must have a list of the longest songs.  Fuck Dream Theater.  Dazed and Confused off Song Remains the Same, 26-53.  Yeah, but that's when he starts using the bow and stuff.  And getting all fucked up.  Yeah, well, that's live version. 
[02:17:30]  Come on.  True.  I would say Dazed and Confused.  Rush 21-12 doesn't come close.  I don't think.  No.  I don't think either.  Wow, that's fucking long, though.  That's ridiculous.  What band puts that on an album?  You don't see that these days, though.  Like, look at these bands.  Look at what we're looking at there.  We're looking at fucking 30-year-old bands. 
[02:18:00]  You put out a song like that now, the record company punch you in the face and laugh at you.  Mm-hmm.  What are you, kidding?  The long version of...  Two minutes and 40 seconds.  The long version of Smells Like Teen Spirit is 47 minutes.  No, it isn't.  Just shut up.  We'll get into some black stuff in a minute.  You just hang out for a minute.  21-12 is totaled 34.9.  Those white boys have a moment.  I'm just sitting there because I'm on the cusp of actually being into this. 
[02:18:30]  It's kind of interesting.  But that song you sang, I'm like, ah, he out-whit me.  Like, he just...  You're just no disgrace.  You took it out to another level of whiteness.  Give us some yes.  Come on, E.  It is such white boy music.  Give me some yes.  That's master degree white.  Which one is that?  Is that long?  No, which one is that, Ant?  With the...  The bass line. 
[02:19:00]  Yours is no disgrace, I believe, yeah.  How thick does it break off?  Try yours is no disgrace.  No disgrace.  I'm trying to run through it in my head.  Yours is no disgrace.  Yeah, I think it is.  You get all crazy in the middle of the song, right?  Let's go.  Yeah.  There it is.  Oh, yeah, Patrice.  I heard that.  You're rocking now.  Of course.  You are.  Didn't a lot of soft rock guys do long songs? 
[02:19:30]  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  Like, ceiling, take me away.  I've done songs like eight hours.  No.  They only seem like it when you're listening to them.  Hey, listen to John Anderson.  Get that voice way up there.  Come on.  Oh, she's still another five minutes before he even starts singing.  Now, what group is this?  Yes.  With the great John Anderson.  Close to the edge, right?  You'd, uh...  Yes, of course.  You'd, uh, listen to this.  Uh, and look at the album covers, man.  It's a lot of artwork.  Take on me? 
[02:20:00]  No, that was, uh-huh.  Piddly, piddly, piddly, piddly, piddly, piddly, piddly.  So these guys are respected.  Oh, my God, yeah.  So in, in white world, what is, are these guys, uh, Jay-Z-ish?  Well, they were huge, but no, they'd have to be, like, old school.  Like, fucking, uh...  Run DMC?  Yeah, yeah.  But they're at that level of...  They were fucking huge back in the 70s.  High level respect or mid-level?  Oh, high level respect as musicians. 
[02:20:30]  This is like art rock.  If Yes was coming to town, you fucking got a ticket.  They took pride in the fact that they could play their instruments, unlike today.  Look at this.  Listen to this.  Here he goes.  Oh, no.  It's still gonna take a while.  This song intro is really...  Hold on.  Here it is.  Here it is.  Oh, is it?  Yesterday, a morning came, a smile upon your face.  Caesar's hottest morning glory, silly human race. 
[02:21:00]  On a sailing ship to nowhere, leaving in your face.  Yeah, that's a bit silly.  Give the sun a change to winter.  He's gonna get his voice even higher.  Listen to this.  Listen to this.  Yeah.  And then back to some playing of the instruments.  Now, does that count?  As what?  As what?  As the time.  Do you understand what I'm saying? 
[02:21:30]  Like, that shouldn't even be added to the...  Like, bye-bye, Miss American Pie.  Hold on, hold on.  There you go. 
[02:22:00]  Any psychedelic groups that ever earned a level of respect?  Yeah, yes was pretty much psychedelic.  Pink Floyd was psychedelic back in the day, right?  Genesis was really whacked out before they decided to start making pop songs.  So that wasn't novelty?  There's some respected...  Yeah.  These guys are...  Oh, yeah.  These guys were the shit.  This is their biggest song?  Get Lee Abrams on the phone from XM.  He'll talk about yes until you fucking want to shoot him. 
[02:22:30]  Is this the...  That'll take three minutes.  Is this their most popular song?  No.  What song might I have heard that broke through to my ears?  Maybe a song.  Fan?  Yeah.  I just saw it in Dillette.  I'm not sure if it's an actual song or not, but it's by Jethro Tull, and it's called The  Story of the Hare Who Lost His Spectacles.  Fuck, come on.  How long is it? 
[02:23:00]  45 minutes.  Holy shit!  Get out of here!  Jethro Tull's a douchebag!  He really is.  Give me a piece of that shit.  Unless it's like an interview or something, and it's just, you know...  Wow.  All right, let's give it a shot.  Wait, what's the title again?  The Story of the Hare Who Lost His Spectacles.  Is it music?  All right, let's...  I don't know.  Let's go.  Huh?  Holy shit.  Oh, come on.  Already.  What's Danny got?  Just get to, like, over a minute, and then that's when it kicks in. 
[02:23:30]  Oh, I kind of want to hear it at the beginning.  It sounds like music that a hare would lose his spectacles by.  Holy shit.  The story of the hare that put an ice pick in his big fucking hare ear.  Oh, I bet this just goes on and on.  He thought he was making some kind of big statement.  I want to thank Ray in Toronto before the lyrics kick in here. 
[02:24:00]  On Wikipedia, look at longest song recorded.  It's Chew and Hiccup.  It's 240 minutes long.  Ha, ha, ha.  That's the name of the song by some shit band.  Yeah, see, that's not cool, because now there's a band out there that's going to record something  that's 241 minutes long just for the fucking it.  Oh, is that what I'm saying?  Jethro Tull's a douchebag.  Who's saying that?  Like, it's...  I was just reminded Jethro Tull's not a person. 
[02:24:30]  It's the band.  I know, I know.  I was just...  I called Jethro Tull a douchebag.  It's Ian Anderson?  I don't care.  Jethro Tull is an asshole.  That guy should be shot.  Wait, what was his name?  Ian Anderson, yeah.  Related to John Anderson?  Ian Anderson.  Probably not.  I know.  Him with his stupid flute.  Oh, here we are.  Finally.  Vocals?  Vocals?  Vocals?  Imagine having to sit through this shit at a concert or something.  You think they did this live? 
[02:25:00]  Thank you.  Ah, he's going to play his flute.  I'm at the fucking Renaissance Festival.  This is great.  When's the joust?  Let me look at my program.  Okay.  First, get me a yard of mead.  Then I'm going to go see the joust.  And then we got to go see the blacksmith make some armor.  Uh-oh.  Now what's happening?  Then I want a big turkey leg.  Yeah.  No, don't skid through it.  By the way, someone took the bait.  I love when people take my bait. 
[02:25:30]  Where is it?  I don't even know where it is now.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Oh, here it is.  Kevin from Buffalo.  How can you not acknowledge Dream Theater as a band?  Explain.  They're one of the most talented bands to ever exist, and I'm not the only one to believe  this, a lot of the listeners will agree.  Frunkus!  Oh.  Oh, here it is.  What's that? 
[02:26:00]  Pardon me, where's the privy?  M'lady?  Mystical rocks stinks.  I feel like putting my wizard robe on.  I don't listen to any song where they sing about gnomes.  If Jimmy was here, he'd be talking about wizardry.  Wizardry.  Wizardry.  Wizardry and songs suck.  This music makes me want to practice my wizardry.  If you've got a gnome in your song, you should kill yourself. 
[02:26:30]  A gnome.  Some flying mystical creature in the middle of your song.  Who gives a shit?  And my Dream Theater rant was interrupted.  I know the Dream Theater people take their band seriously.  Oh, they do.  Hence, I will not acknowledge Dream Theater.  Ever.  Ever make me!  All right.  Enough.  What else don't you want in your music?  Yeah, let's do that bit.  Yeah.  We're freestyling, right?  I don't want a flute.  You don't want a flute in your... 
[02:27:00]  And I don't want a lute.  No lute, no flute, and no lyrics about gnomes.  Gnomes.  Stop with the gnomes.  And dragons.  And unicorns that fly.  And don't sing about trees, because they just stink.  Trees.  Rush.  Yeah, rush.  I know.  That was good.  I don't want the bass player playing foot pedals. 
[02:27:30]  Getty Lee playing his foot pedals, keyboard, and bass at the same time.  Wow, we're fucking amazed at you.  No gongs.  He would do...  Yeah.  Drummers, throw away your gongs.  That is why I try to learn about white music.  Yeah.  I learned all the love I have for white music from wrestling intros.  Oh, is that it?  Because they used to be able to play all these songs.  So that song, Rush, when they played Tom Sawyer. 
[02:28:00]  Yeah.  That was what Kerry Von Erick's intro music used to be.  And that's how you learned about white music, not Tom Sawyer.  But I didn't know that Rush was a bum band.  Yeah.  Rush was pretty big.  How about Queen?  Queen was fucking huge.  Now, how long has my cameo rap scene?  I just don't like this.  Oh, that's the song's long off.  Is this the carb thing, you guys?  If it's not...  I think it should be a rule that if you're playing the fucking song with just some dude's  riffing on his guitar for an hour, it doesn't count. 
[02:28:30]  Only verses should count.  Every Grateful Dead song then stinks.  Hey!  Yeah.  You got dream theater problems.  Don't make me stand up like Patrice did an hour and a half ago.  Grateful Dead sucks.  Hey!  And the only things I could even listen to are the songs that Grateful Dead fans hate.  They're fucking sellout hits.  Give me Touch of Grey any day of the week.  And someone's got fighting words and some feedback.  Someone from Boston's gonna get a bop on the nose today. 
[02:29:00]  I'm gonna listen to someone tuning for fucking 45 minutes.  That's the Grateful Dead.  That don't count.  Nope.  You're right.  Fucking this guy's saying, I don't even know where his feedback is anymore,  but he's saying dream theater's better than Snow Patrol.  Now we got a problem.  No woodwinds.  No woodwinds.  I don't want woodwinds.  No instrument with reeds.  A reed should not be, a roadie should not have to go, quick, get a reed.  It should only be from-  Get a reed.  This one is soggy.  Come on.  Get him a reed.  Replace the soggy reed before the next song. 
[02:29:30]  If I wanted to make a song long, I could just go, I love something, and then go,  and keep going.  Like, for as long as I need to.  Right.  Just because they're playing for this long, it shouldn't count.  Yep.  Only words should count at the time.  I got another one.  Such a great.  There it is.  A big hit.  I got another one.  And I respect Jimmy Page.  Uh-huh.  But I don't want a guitar with more than one neck. 
[02:30:00]  Ever.  Yeah, stop that.  Ever.  It's not necessary.  And especially the cheap trick, five neck, six neck guitar.  And no wearing of spandex in my music, ever.  How about organs?  Organs?  Synthesize.  A Moog?  A Moog is cool.  One of the synthesizers?  Old school Moogs?  Oh, that is old.  Old school Moogs?  No druids.  Don't sing songs about druids. 
[02:30:30]  Steven Oakdale, he gets it.  Dream theater equals musical masturbation.  If your band has a keytar.  What's a keytar?  That's the keyboard that you wear with a strap.  And play.  Stick it up his asshole.  If your band's trying to be cool by not having a guitar player, I don't want to hear it.  Don't even want to hear it.  Right.  How about any of those rock bands that have a classical instrument somewhere in it? 
[02:31:00]  Stop it.  There's a cello player.  No cello.  No bowed instruments.  We shouldn't have a roadie yelling, he needs rosin.  Quick, more rosin.  Where are we at with wind chimes?  No.  No wind chimes.  Drummer with wind chimes.  Or bongos.  I don't want a rock band with bongos.  And no whistling.  And no harps. 
[02:31:30]  Peter from Massachusetts.  No pyro unless you want to kill your fans.  Great white.  Well, if your intention is to kill your fans, then you could use pyro.  Pyro.  Pyro is big.  Even local little shit bands would sit off an M80 in a club.  Where are we with fog machines?  Fog machines are done.  Fog machines stink, especially if there's a draft in the arena. 
[02:32:00]  It's supposed to make this awesome scene of fog that goes up to the ceiling, and instead,  what do you get?  What do you get?  You get like a little fog sweeping across the stage into your face because you got the  awful side seats.  No drum solos.  Oh, boy.  Stop it.  Oh, no.  Now we got a problem.  Look.  Now we got a problem.  Who's sitting there during the drum solo?  Now we got a problem.  Drummers.  Everyone else gets up and gets a beer.  Sorry, bud. 
[02:32:30]  Sorry.  I'm going to say the same thing, Dan.  Shut up.  I used to be in your camp, and we used to talk about this on the air all the time.  I know the bit you're doing at.  I know what you're doing.  But Godsmack brought the drum solo back.  All right.  Different version of a drum solo.  I need the Godsmack drum solo.  Different drum solo.  It's not just some one tool up there. 
[02:33:00]  That was a drum duel.  You want to hear the most amazing fucking drum solo thing?  Because it's not a solo.  Find it.  It's two fucking people.  It doesn't matter.  No, it does.  It's drumming.  It's a drum duel.  Fucking Phil Collins did a drum duel with one of his guys.  I wasn't bitching about Phil Collins.  I wasn't bitching about Phil Collins.  I was going to have to submit the live version of YYZ.  That drums.  Oh, fucking Neil Peart gets going.  How about a nice fucking Van Halen drum solo? 
[02:33:30]  Ugh.  Speaking of Rush.  Worst though, the bass solo by Michael Anthony.  No bass solos ever, unless you're Spinal Tap.  Speaking of Rush.  Big bottom.  No triangles in my music.  Take your triangles and throw them away if you want to have a rock band.  I want to hear plank, plank, plank as it's rolling down.  Well, a triangle can't roll now, can't it?  I like during the drum solo when the drummer's got to hit the hi-hat right in the middle and  give the little ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, 
[02:34:00]  and everyone goes, whoa, ding, ding, ding.  And then it goes, boo-doo, boo-doo, boo-doo, boo-doo, boo-doo, boo-doo, boo-doo, boo-doo,  boo-doo, boo-doo, boo-doo, boo-doo, boo-doo.  Shut up!  When did all this become hack?  When it was like, oh God.  After Nirvana made it a hack?  Today.  It's hack right now.  Right now.  No maracas!  Or tambourines!  Oh, God.  You wrote down the tambourines.  I'm sorry. 
[02:34:30]  That's like died with the Partridge family.  All right, right.  Somebody had a really good one.  I can't remember now because we're all over.  Oh, Scott Bryan from Indy.  No ironic covers by rock bands of pop songs.  Yeah, ironic covers.  That's different than just a cover.  Right.  It's an ironic cover.  I get the ironic cover thing.  No jugs and washboards.  All right, I may be going back.  I like the jugs.  No spoons and paper and a comb. 
[02:35:00]  What about Spoon Man?  Spoon Man.  No Jews harps.  I like that sound.  Is it juice or Jews?  Juice.  Juice like what you drink or Jews like you know?  How about xylophones?  Let me think.  Xylophones, xylophones.  No!  A xylophone. 
[02:35:30]  Electric xylophone.  I got never a didgeridoo.  A diggeridoo.  Australians.  And none of these.  Wah wah.  And I...  No auto harp.  And no calliopes.  Calliopes!  Okay, we may have gone a little too far. 
[02:36:00]  A didgeridoo.  Australian for bear.  Come to Australia.  Oh, listen, though.  It gets going.  It's a didgeridoo.  Aye.  Aye.  I got one.  Aye.  Last of the V8 Interceptors.  How about giant feet pianos?  You can't have that in a rock song. 
[02:36:30]  I don't want the mic stand decorated with anything.  Bandanas, man.  No!  Aerosmith.  No scarves.  No hippie crap.  Nothing.  That is stupid.  How about giant vintage microphones?  No, those are asinine.  The ones they hold.  Yeah.  Complete time.  So you can be a crooner.  And crooner song.  With a big microphone.  I don't want a guitarist to have 80 picks taped up his mic stand either. 
[02:37:00]  So he could throw them out like it's...  Like you're getting something special.  The guy tapes.  He puts double-sided tape on his mic stand.  And tapes picks there.  So he could throw out 100 of them.  It's not special.  All right.  Hold on.  No timpanis.  Can I do one?  Sure.  No oversized fruit.  What?  Where did that happen?  I gotta be a U2 fan.  What can I tell you?  Oh. 
[02:37:30]  You know, the big lemon.  No pan flutes.  Yeah, no pan flutes.  Let's say hi to Baton Rouge.  Eric in Baton Rouge.  Zamfair.  I'm playing the...  What was that, Charities of Fire?  No bottles of...  I rule on the pan flute. 
[02:38:00]  No bottles of water on the stage.  They gotta drink.  Jack.  Jack only.  Like the old one.  Model of Jack.  Here it is.  No Yanni.  Yeah, thanks.  Whatever he plays.  Whatever he plays.  Plays the air.  No more upright basses, Eric?  No stand-up basses.  All right.  No stand-up basses.  What about...  No backup singers.  Where you at with giant flying animals? 
[02:38:30]  Nick!  If the band can't do it themselves, I don't want no backup singers.  What about...  What about the building of a brick wall?  No, unless you're gonna crash something into it and break it down, man.  That represents breaking down the barriers, man.  How about no lighters?  All right, what?  No lighters.  Sorry. 
[02:39:00]  It's getting carried away.  What's wrong with lighters?  I don't know.  No old sci-fi movie clips.  Playing in the background.  So basically...  We don't need it.  I'm there for the band.  Basically what we're trying to tell everyone, we just want one lousy guitar.  Sergeant Magoo has one.  What about 40 fake Marshall amps?  No!  No!  We know they're fake.  No wall of sound!  Wall of sound, my ass. 
[02:39:30]  Wipe yourself off.  I'm spitting on myself.  I'm so excited.  No elevators coming out the floor.  Yes.  You can't be popping through the floor in a bunch of smoke.  And with that said, keep the drum set on the ground!  Right.  No flying drum set.  I don't want any flying drummers.  Oh boy.  Now we pissed off some Zeppelin fans.  Keep your bagpipes off the stage too.  I think...  No bagpipes in a rock band? 
[02:40:00]  Get away.  No?  No.  And the drums should not spin 360 degrees.  Get rid of In the Round!  Stop the spinning drum set.  How about In the Round in general?  The whole stage?  Oh.  Hey, let's say hi to Eric in Baton Rouge.  No flying Bon Jovi over the audience.  How stupid flying Bon Jovi.  How about stop breaking your instruments?  Yeah.  That's so passe.  That was like the who. 
[02:40:30]  Don't break your guitar.  It's just stupid.  I got one.  I got one.  Yeah.  No giving the mic to a fan because you're too lazy to sing the goddamn song.  Not just a fan.  Turning the mic to the crowd.  That's what I mean.  To have them do the whole chorus part that you went to hear.  You go to hear the hook of the song.  Right.  And they turn it around and the audience sings it.  Yeah.  What's a good example of that?  There's a...  Metallica has a live album, Binge and Purge.  And during one of their Mexico City concerts during Seek and Destroy, 
[02:41:00]  they give the mic to some of the Mexican fans.  And it's really the funniest thing because they know the words,  but they can't speak English.  So they're all saying it in Spanish accent.  That sucks.  Metallica comes around what?  Every five years.  That could be your favorite song.  And some fucking Mexicans are fucking it up for you.  How about no doing your new songs out of integrity for your art?  Right.  Keep your new shit away from the stage until we hear it on an album.  Until we want to hear it. 
[02:41:30]  Until it's old.  If you're Styx, Journey, REO, Speedwagon, yeah, don't fucking give us your new shit.  We want the hits.  We're there to hear the classic hits that we've heard 25 fucking years on radio.  Or if you're Neil Young, don't go out there with your self-serving new songs.  You're self-serving.  It is self-serving.  Self-serving artwork.  No one wants to hear it.  I got one.  And it's going to hurt me personally, but I have to say it.  If you're missing a body part, I don't want to see your band. 
[02:42:00]  We don't want to see it.  Stop it.  With that said, Jerry Garcia was missing, you know, a finger.  If you're blind, stop with the guitar on your lap.  It's getting morbid and shit.  How about no more dying in plane crashes?  Oh, Def Leppard.  Jesus.  One-armed drummer.  Good gracious.  No more toes.  Enough with the lasers.  Hey, Fear from New York City.  Bravo.  No stopping the music to do a clap-along.  No more clap-alongs. 
[02:42:30]  They just ruin it.  Joe from Detroit.  We said that one.  No having the fans do your job for you.  Fucking bands love that one.  How about no more old white bitches sitting on shoulders?  Where are you at with glockenspiels?  I hate the glockenspiel.  Spiel.  The glockenspiel.  All right.  We got to get into this Zeppelin's.  This guy's mad at us.  Eric in Baton Rouge.  Go ahead. 
[02:43:00]  What happened?  Hey, fellas.  Love you.  Love the show.  But what about Led Zeppelin?  Aren't they the exception to your rule?  I mean, they sing about hobbits.  They got the drum solo with Moby Dick.  I mean, where does that fall into it?  You know what, Eric?  I agree with you.  So it's a new rule.  Okay.  Zeppelin can do whatever they want.  Wow.  That's it.  Well, Zeppelin isn't around anymore.  I know, but Zeppelin is the only band we're not talking to.  The only band we're not talking to. 
[02:43:30]  I don't know about that.  They get a pass on all this shit.  I don't think they do.  Fucking Jimmy Page can play a fucking guitar with eight necks if he wants to.  I, jeez.  What is this one?  I don't even know this one.  No more, how's everyone doing?  I can't hear you.  I said, how's everyone doing?  You heard us the first time, douchebag.  That's pretty funny.  I hate that.  How we doing tonight?  Speaking of that one.  I said, how we doing.  I answered you.  Speaking of that one.  No second, how we doing.  No second, how we doings. 
[02:44:00]  I got something to add to that.  Yes.  No yelling out of our city.  We know you don't give a shit and you don't even know what city you're in.  And we know where we are.  Right.  Most of the time.  Don't make believe you're into Cleveland because you happened to be in Cleveland that night.  Same thing.  The bands.  Huh?  Same thing.  It was just in my head, Cleveland.  Cleveland.  Hey, Cleveland.  How you doing, Cleveland?  What?  And in the middle of a song.  I talked to David Crosby back in the day.  Did you?  When I was just a little thing doing this job. 
[02:44:30]  And he told me he doesn't even know what city he was in.  It was Rochester.  He goes, I really don't know what city I'm in.  Where are we?  Because they just play, get on a bus, and then they go somewhere.  And then they're at the next venue.  You don't know where they are.  After a while, they don't give a shit what city they're in.  If I see a curtain open halfway through the song and a gospel choir starts singing from  behind the curtain, I'm fucking out.  I'm out!  Are you ready for a miracle?  Yeah! 
[02:45:00]  Woo!  All right, if we're going to go that way.  Miracle!  No gospel.  Are you ready?  Ready?  Ready?  Ready?  Are you ready?  Are you ready?  Ready?  Ready?  Ready?  Ready?  Ready?  Ready?  Ready?  Ready?  Yeah.  Am I ready?  No.  Stop it.  All right.  I don't want to.  I don't.  Like, I don't mind this because this is gospel.  I mind, like, if a rock band's playing and then the curtain opens up and Harlem's up  there on some risers and all of a sudden they're singing gospel.  I don't want to hear it. 
[02:45:30]  I don't want to hear it, Henry.  I got one.  One encore.  It's all you get.  I got one.  What?  No video montage is to make us feel sad.  I fucked it up.  You don't like the video montage?  No, they're there to make you feel sad.  I get it.  There's problems in the world.  We just play the fucking music.  That is a choral.  Oh, the montages.  Oh, I get it.  Yeah, we're all one in this world. 
[02:46:00]  And I want to get what I want.  Sometimes you can't, but I want to get what I want.  And I don't want to have to try sometime.  Did you do the encore one?  I got one with you.  Yes.  Encores stink.  One encore.  And do it immediately.  Don't make us wait.  Come on out, lighters.  No fake goodnights.  We know you're coming back.  Thank you.  That's how you put that one. 
[02:46:30]  No fake goodnights.  It's like, goodnight.  Hey, hey.  Hey, gentlemen, it's been great.  What I said?  Thank you.  You've been a fantastic audience.  We're going to be good.  And you're watching Zeppelin.  Hello, you still haven't played Stairway to Heaven.  We're not stupid.  Oh, so they'll leave without playing Stairway.  Oh, yeah.  Okay, that's going to happen.  No fake goodnights.  How about no evil cartoon mascot characters on the album?  This is going to be a little obscure, but something I learned back in the day.  Back in the day.  No fake encore so you can get the fuck out of the venue so you're not stuck in traffic 
[02:47:00]  with the rest of us schmucks.  Where they don't flip the lights on.  I learned that.  Until you think someone's coming out again.  I finally asked somebody about that.  Why did they keep the lights down and let everyone clap forever and then the band never  comes back?  The reason, they're running to their limos because they don't want to be stuck in the  fucking traffic that you're going to be stuck in on the way home.  Oh, how about this?  Once the lights go out before the concert even starts, no fucking roadies to the microphone.  Because then everyone goes, yeah! 
[02:47:30]  Because they think the band's starting.  No guitar techs!  When they have to run out another guitar like it's the most important thing in the world.  How about no opening acts?  No opening acts.  The band right away.  Right.  Is the crowd ready for the band right away?  The second I get there, start.  That's what I want.  Have you ever seen a band open up for a big band and go, wow, these guys were enjoyable.  I enjoyed them really good. 
[02:48:00]  Yeah, they were really, that's why I could leave now.  I don't even want to see the band I came to see.  I came to see this fucking opening band.  Can I go for local bands that are listening, for small timers?  Oh, boy.  We don't want to hear your own shit.  If you're a cover band, don't say, oh, we want to do one of our own now.  Right.  Because you know what?  We don't want to hear it.  Right.  Play some fucking cover music.  Hey, John in Utah has got a great one.  John, go ahead.  John. 
[02:48:30]  Hey, boys.  Yeah, no more political beliefs, man.  Just fucking do your job and rock me.  Yeah, we don't want to know who you're voting for.  Right.  We just want to hear the hits.  Yeah, fuck Bush.  Right.  You know, I got to tell you, the president's done a pretty lousy job, man.  Play your fucking song, douchebag.  No political.  Oh, man.  Am I with Steve from Wack Pack?  Steve G.  No fucking zebra ever. 
[02:49:00]  No guitarist and singer sharing a microphone.  Stop it.  Back to back.  That's gay.  It's so gay.  Might as well share a cock.  How about no, when the lead singer's gone in the band.  No new lead singer.  No new lead singer.  Fuck, you're kind of nailing what Scott's going to say.  Scott in Arkansas, go ahead.  Hey, if you lose all the members of the band, you got to change the fucking name of the band. 
[02:49:30]  There you go.  And I hate to say it.  I think if the lead singer changes, the name of the band has to change.  Yes.  And I know people will argue ACDC and some other things, but in general, you have to change the name of your band.  Oh, I'm losing my mind.  My hands on the floor are forevermore.  Zebra.  Who's behind the door?  Live zebra. 
[02:50:00]  Yeah.  This is zebra.  I saw live zebra with Randy.  Here he goes.  Is he another Randy Jackson?  Yep.  Here he goes.  Oh, I missed that one.  Yeah. 
[02:50:30]  No goofy choreography.  I agree with you there.  Broke Town Bobby from Massachusetts.  This is Dan Goodabat.  Zebra?  Zebra was our big hope.  Zebra was the big hope for Long Island.  That was Long Island's big fucking hope.  That was going to put Long Island on the map.  It had a final pout-down feel to it.  Wow.  Wow, wow, wow.  And then he goes, I did it so bad.  You got to tell me.  Tell me what you want.  Tell me what you want.  We had to share Zebra with New Orleans.  New Orleans, yeah. 
[02:51:00]  That was such crock as shit.  That was the closest we came to having a real fucking band come from Long Island.  And then we find out, well, they spent part of their time on Long Island.  They're also from New Orleans.  You know who else was one of Long Island's great hopes was the Good Rats.  That was one of their songs.  No, their song was Tasty.  Dennis D. from Jersey.  Zebra sucks cock.  I just don't get it, dude. 
[02:51:30]  And now the big hope for Long Island, Future 86.  That's right.  The Cablevision chick singer song.  Don't mess with them.  It's sad that I don't get, like, it's embarrassing.  I don't even say what I like because you're like, I enjoyed that Zebra song just now.  You like Zebra, right?  It's all right.  I enjoyed that song.  It hit me like I enjoyed it.  I like that little thing they were doing.  That was live, too.  Like Final Countdown.  I just love that song.  Final Countdown.  All right.  We were going to end the bit, but the phones have exploded.  Yes, I say that from time to time. 
[02:52:00]  Serge from Canada, what's up?  Hey, how's it going?  Hey.  No more drummers doing stick twirls or tricks.  Yes, stop it.  Hold your sticks.  Play your drums.  Stick twirls.  Stick twirls.  Well, let's throw it up in the air like so it's up in the lights.  You're not fooling anyone.  You're not as important as the singer or the guitarist.  So stop trying to bring attention to yourself.  This is actually coming from a drummer, too. 
[02:52:30]  Oh, drummer.  Play the fucking drums.  Drummer's the guy that hangs out with musicians.  How about the lead singer and whoever else singing to each other?  Ugh.  Yeah, creepy gay.  You know what I'm saying?  Like, you know, blah, blah, blah, and the other one, blah, and they rock back and forth.  Yeah.  In each other's face.  And no guitarist singer note-offs.  Oh, very good.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. 
[02:53:00]  No.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Shut up.  None of that gay interaction between bandmates where, like, the guitarist is playing and the lead singer  has to kind of move his hips like he's getting into it.  He's dancing with them.  He'll put his arm around him and look at his guitar and go, yeah.  And then feel his ball bag.  How about the lead singer pretending to really be into the guitar solo?  Yeah.  And he's playing air guitar, and he's making the faces and throwing his head back? 
[02:53:30]  Yeah.  Don't ever do that.  Oh.  I don't know what this one is.  I got to go to Joe in Vegas.  Joe, what's up?  Morning.  I love you guys.  Hey.  Oh, God.  We missed one.  No more scatting.  Yeah.  Well, that was kind of scatting with the guitar, but I understand.  All right.  Where are you at with those voice box things? 
[02:54:00]  Oh, the talk box?  The talk box.  That was kind of cool with, you know.  Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.  What did he say there?  Oh. 
[02:54:30]  No, now, no talk box.  Stop it.  How about no more lead singers who have male pattern baldness?  And they're hiding it with hats and scarves.  My favorite was the guy from Scorpions.  Scorpions.  He was good.  He tried on the sides, but that top wasn't working for him.  No more.  And then the other guy from, oh, come on, feel the noise. 
[02:55:00]  Quiet Riot.  Quiet Riot.  Yeah, here's another one.  And then, like, a few years later, you saw him, and he had this big poodle head of hair.  I guess they stitched some on.  This is a good one.  Is this from E-Rock?  No more singing drummers.  Oh.  I used to hate that, man.  Well, absolutely.  They're drumming and singing at the same time.  If you're going to sing a song, give the drumsticks to somebody else for a song.  I got to go with one guy, though.  Don Henley.  Hotel California. 
[02:55:30]  That guy was fucking playing and singing that song to a T.  But you don't remember the drumming part.  Yeah.  I think it took away from his vocals.  Oh, my God.  What about my Sharona?  Right?  Going from Hotel California to my Sharona might have been a bit of a leap.  Off a cliff.  Oh, help me.  Klaus Mein was the lead singer of the Scorpions.  Klaus.  Klaus.  Kyle from Virginia. 
[02:56:00]  Thank you.  No more bands wearing Lane Bryant.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Oh, it's Steven Carr.  Of Foundry.  Of Foundry.  When I play, the song Pendulum comes on.  When we play Pendulum.  All right.  It's Pendulum.  Here's Steve, our own Steve.  Yeah, baby.  Steve Carlisi.  He was known as Steven Carr back in his band Foundry.  And this is his song Pendulum. 
[02:56:30]  What's he play?  He sings, my friend.  Oh, wow.  Okay.  And did he play guitar also?  Or was he just the singer?  And he weighed 8,000 pounds at the time.  Yeah.  Swear to God.  Big fat guy.  And he got his clothes at Lane Bryant.  See, I would love to make fun of this.  He wore women's clothing.  I like this song.  I like to wear women's clothing.  I actually like this song.  Here comes Steven Carr now.  This is Steve?  Oh, yeah.  Fucking A.  It's Steve. 
[02:57:00]  Oh, this rocks.  Wait for the chorus.  You're going to shit your pants. 
[02:57:30]  Yeah.  Fucking Pendulum.  My heart is here.  Here it comes.  I'm a little cold.  The shame for him is something that I just can't throw away.  This is a great girl and let's get out of my way.  That's the love is playing back the other way.  Caught me.  Nothing but caught me.  All right.  Very good.  I'll go home and get your fucking shine box.  Kerry T from Jersey. 
[02:58:00]  No socks on cocks.  That's Red Hot Chili Peppers.  Yeah.  Goes back a ways.  Oh, wow.  Critique's coming.  It sounds like typical 80s industrial pop.  Oh, little echo.  Oh, I think you lost your chances because when they interview you, your interviews were probably  not what the fans wanted to see.  His band has as much focus as his website.  He was a little too well-spoken for like a rock lead guy, you know? 
[02:58:30]  Hey, where are we at with cowbells?  Did we do cowbells?  No.  Keep them out of fucking anything.  But more cowbell.  Industrial pop, old school ministry.  Yeah.  What happened to Foundry?  They're just getting panned here on Pal Talk.  Oh, boy.  I like Pendulum.  I really do.  What happened to Foundry?  Everyone had day jobs.  Everyone had day jobs in the band, so it was sort of...  You didn't commit?  Well, I think I was subsidizing pretty much the whole thing, and I decided the band had  to move to either New York, Nashville, or L.A., and everybody had day jobs and girlfriends, 
[02:59:00]  so I just said, eh, I'm leaving.  Really?  Yeah.  No talking through your songs like David Lee Roth.  Yeah.  No talking.  Sing.  How about this one?  No making your hit song unrecognizable.  Oh, loud.  That's why the fuck we go to see it.  Bravo.  We had no change in the...  Dude, that happened with...  I saw Dylan back in the day, and I saw Neil Young back in the day, both of them.  Like, the song is almost over, and I'm like... 
[02:59:30]  Is that it?  That was blowing in the wind?  That might have been the best one out of all of them just now, is that, yeah, you go  and you want to hear...  You just want to hear the song, and you want to sing with it.  You just want to hear...  Yeah.  Don't stop...  Don't change it.  Don't rephrase things.  That should have been way up there.  That's way up there on the list of things.  Yeah.  If you did a countdown, that might be number one.  No millionaire band members making the devil horns.  We know you live in a mansion. 
[03:00:00]  How about no new tattoos?  You can have the ones you had when you were crazy, but no new ones.  Fucking dog shit sniffer.  We really want to have this bit get on to other things, but we can't help ourselves.  He writes, no more dressing up like it's fucking Halloween.  That's a good one, too, from Richmond Boogie.  No singing the same song three times in one night, because you don't have much of a catalog. 
[03:00:30]  Well, that was aha.  How about no...  Oh, it was also modern English back in the day.  How about no modern haircuts, but you keep the old mustache?  You keep the old 70s.  You get rid of the mullet, but you keep some other old shit, just to remind you.  All right.  Hey, did we find that Godsmack drum solo?  I would love to play that.  Maybe we play that instead of making the people listen to... 
[03:01:00]  Tell them about the discount, Harry!  How about we do that instead of breaking?  Can we play the Godsmack fucking drum solo?  Can we find that anywhere?  It has to be out there.  Huh?  No.  I don't know what song is.  No change in a song.  It was not a song, really.  It was just some fucking thing they did.  It was just amazing.  No fucking intermission.  Very good.  Ow.  See?  We're done with the bit.  Yeah.  And that's how a bit dies.  It's like a sun. 
[03:01:30]  You know?  It goes into the last, and then it's supernovas,  and then black hole where all humor is sucked in.  No more can get out.  I got one where I could bring Patrice into the discussion,  if you don't mind.  Don't start rapping because rap is cool now.  Hey, now you're talking about Rush again.  That's right.  Really?  It comes back to Rush.  They don't...  Oh, Rush tried it.  Don't go with the trend.  Roll the bones.  Roll the bones.  Have you ever heard the rap in Roll the Bones?  It's so bad. 
[03:02:00]  Get me the rap in Roll the Bones.  Oh, it's so bad.  I'm not a Rush fan.  It's just like the wrestling intro.  I enjoy that song.  You ever hear Queens, I'm in love with my car?  You got it?  Yeah, yeah.  You like that song?  I hate it.  All right, listen.  Here's Rush rapping.  This is as bad as Blondie's first rap song. 
[03:02:30]  Yeah.  That's awesome.  That's fucking hideous.  But you know something, though?  Ah, fuck.  Never mind.  No, this is just...  Any black respected rockers?  Fish?  Isn't Fish...  Like, where white people go, fuck, these motherfuckers.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Living Color was huge.  Hey, hey, uh...  Fishbone?  Hey, uh...  Fishbone.  They're taking a shot at Anthony.  Hey, they're taking a shot at Anthony.  It's very rare, so I'm going to enjoy this. 
[03:03:00]  What did I do?  Duncan Booth Douche...  None?  I don't know.  What is your name?  Duncan...  Duncan Booth Douche None?  I think he put none for his last name.  Oh, okay.  So it's Duncan Booth Douche, right?  It's no more Neil Diamond impressions at every live event.  Exactly.  What do you think?  What do you think?  I go up there and want to do that?  I'm forced to.  I must say, at the last karaoke event we went to...  Yeah.  We all had a great time.  It was my sister's birthday. 
[03:03:30]  Yep.  And we went to a karaoke club.  I did not sing one Neil Diamond song.  I know.  And you sang some great songs?  Me and Opie got up there and actually sang a Hall & Oates song.  Oh, no shit.  Hey, it was one of those rare...  And who was Hall and who was Oates?  As a matter of fact, y'all should play them in the movie.  Hall & Oates, the movie you should fucking play, though, guys.  All right.  Holy shit.  Stop stating the obvious.  Holy shit.  We try to avoid that shit.  We get that up.  But we want to be in the new Starsky & Hutch movie.  Right, right.  Wow.  All right. 
[03:04:00]  Hall & Oates.  And it was Man Eater.  Yeah, it was Man Eater.  That's never even hit my head once in my...  Oh, please.  Oh, shut up.  It shit has.  We've known that one for years.  Two Hall & Oates looking motherfuckers.  Shut up.  God damn.  All right.  I think we kind of did the thing.  Because your kiss, your kiss is on my lips.  Because your kiss...  Hey, the Godsmack drum solo is on YouTube.  So let's try to find a good copy of it, all right?  It's amazing. 
[03:04:30]  It really is.  All right, we should take a break.  By the way, see, we could do radio.  If we feel like it.  Nah.  Sometimes.  See, we felt like doing a little radio today.  Go fuck yourself.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Wine.  Ah. 
[03:05:00]  Yeah, just give Patrice a mic.  Just do it from the couch there, Patrice.  You're that damn good.  Let me tell you something.  You're that damn good.  You just lay there, and then we'll put a mic right in front of your face.  I couldn't do it.  You couldn't do it that way?  Oh, shit.  All right.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Patrice O'Neal helping us out today.  Let's not forget, Jimmy Norton's going to be on Jimmy Kimmel tonight.  I said Jimmy because Jimmy Kimmel.  What an idiot.  Jim Norton on Jimmy Kimmel tonight.  Make sure you take a peek, okay?  Yes.  People want us to do the top country songs in America.  Um, I gotta, I gotta, I gotta start this break by saying I, I acknowledge that we had the 
[03:05:30]  gayest show ever yesterday.  Yesterday.  Uh, yeah.  Awful.  I acknowledge it.  I agree with everything I read about it.  It was the gayest show ever.  And, uh, we just have to stop.  Yeah.  We might, we might all need gay rehab.  I don't think we'll do that again.  We have to get the gay out of this fucking show.  Dude, we took it to a level yesterday.  I, I, I was looking at the pictures.  I was like, what was, what was wrong with us yesterday? 
[03:06:00]  Horrid.  What was wrong with us?  I don't know.  I think we were so desperate to get that contest to work and get it done.  Uh, you know, did it end with slipped into the gay zone?  Did it end with Jared having ball bags on his face?  Did it really end with that?  That's pretty much how, yeah, that was the, the payoff.  Balls on his nose.  I am sorry to everybody listening.  That was just wrong. 
[03:06:30]  So wrong.  I'm looking at the pictures.  I, I don't even think we should post the pictures.  I, I, I think we should make believe this never happened.  Really bad.  Faggots.  Yep.  I'm not even going to argue the point.  Show fucking Patrice.  That's what happened yesterday.  Spinning, spinning around for the guy.  That's what happened yesterday.  That guy's balls are out.  And he's plunking them down.  On Jared's face.  On Jared's nose. 
[03:07:00]  Something went wrong.  Something went wrong.  We got a bit off track.  A bit?  Just a tad.  No, it wasn't T-Bag Tuesday.  Well, do we have time to do some of the country songs?  Uh, we could, we could do some other things.  Some things.  Um, Danny's got some audio from the Toby Randloff show from Public Access. 
[03:07:30]  The hell's that?  Or is it the Eddie Marshall show, I guess?  The Eddie Marshall show, Toby?  What does he do?  Toby apparently was also the star of some early MTV segments.  Uh, by me.  Are you guys going to be watching America's Top Inventor tonight?  You're a big fan of that show, huh?  The finale?  Really?  Oh, it's tonight, man.  I missed it.  I, I don't watch that.  You don't even, I don't, I thought I was anti-shows forever, but this show is, I tried getting  into it the first season and I was just like, eh, this guy's just a kook and. 
[03:08:00]  It's fantastic, man.  Yeah?  It absolutely is one of the best shows I've seen.  What's going to win?  Some toilet device?  Well, the, the, the finals is a guy and everyone cried.  The, in the finals, everyone was a crier.  Um, this is my dream.  A black girl who invented, um, a, a backless bra for big titty women, but then she backed  off and made it for all women.  And, and the idea that shows you go to every city, like whatever they, like five, six cities 
[03:08:30]  and every inventor comes to that, comes to the, you know, and you get to choose, right?  But they have to have a patent so it can't be stolen.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  So it's George Foreman, um, your boy from, used to run the Philadelphia 76ers.  Oh yeah, yeah.  Pat Croce.  Pat Croce.  I didn't, I, I, yeah.  Okay.  He's one of the judges, a girl that invented stockings.  And then this, again, I don't know what happened, but now English people are America's judges.  Yeah. 
[03:09:00]  And it's the same, what's this nonsense?  This is awful.  Fucking cocksucker.  And he hates anything that has to do with making the toilet better.  Oh really?  If you come up with a better toilet thing, he'll tell you your mother sucks.  You know what I mean?  He's like, what's the, toilets are great and leave them alone.  But people come with like smell goods or automatic cleaners.  And he's like, oh fuck yourself.  The Lou is perfect.  So the finalist is one guy who cried cause he loved, uh, drag racing. 
[03:09:30]  And he just had invented something that I almost wanted to take a shit on is he invented a thing  that he just, he drag races cars.  He took two matchbox cars, matchbox cars and let them go.  And one beats the other.  And it, it stinks, but it went through.  Okay.  And by the way, George Foreman says yes to everything.  But he's my favorite judge.  He's the happy.  He's great though.  Cause he will say no if it sucks, but he goes, you know, I would, I would buy that. 
[03:10:00]  But everybody's rich.  So they would buy anything.  Why would I need something that way?  I got someone to wipe my ass for me.  I have a Mexican woman to do that.  Right?  So, so they don't even relate, but this, the three finalists were matter of fact, the six  finalists, but they canceled three for this.  Tonight is the end.  It was, uh, two white brothers, two old brothers who invented, um, like a shelf that held every 
[03:10:30]  wrap in your house, saran, aluminum, blah, blah, blah.  And it went under the counter.  It, I, it was awful, but it made it to the finals.  And by the way, if you win the preliminary, you get 50 G's nice to not for your pocket  to develop your idea.  Okay.  Now tonight it's a fireman who cried.  Everybody's a crier.  The black girl invented the bra. 
[03:11:00]  I was raped.  Um, my, my daddy, uh, poked both my eyes out and I had to go, I got fish eyes in my, you  know, my daughter's underarm stink, you know, it's like Lord of Jesus.  I need to, I need to win.  So she got a great idea.  Backless big titty bra.  Big titty.  And the idea is if you take a backpack and kind of, her idea is like you take a backpack,  turn it forwards.  Gotcha.  So it's on, it's on the shoulder and then it holds the titty in. 
[03:11:30]  You know, back.  Yeah.  So for big titty women, she grew there with a backless, backless big titty bra.  Exactly.  Big fat back titty bra, which can't win.  It would have won if it wasn't for this motherfucker.  Oh, and the car guy, he changed his shit right up with the 50,000.  He had another idea to make paper, paper, uh, automatic paper model cars.  So you would make a plane out of paper, but you would have a remote control that you put 
[03:12:00]  it in a paper and fly a paper remote control plane or drive a paper remote control car.  Horrendous.  But he's in the fucking finals and he's a crier.  I always loved paper planes.  Now you gotta watch this dumb show.  Thanks.  And the winner is because I watch it, me and Bobby watch it on the phone, like two faggots.  Oh, Bobby must cry too.  And, and, and, and like we go, I go, what the fuck? 
[03:12:30]  Because one day I cursed the English guy out because this Spanish woman created, um, gloves,  washing gloves with the actual, with the scouring pad on the glove shaped like the hand.  So she just could get in there and no one pisses me off about that really fast.  Why wasn't that invented before?  That seems so fucking obvious.  Fucking sucked.  And you gotta have a patent.  You gotta have a patent.  And the thing that's all right about the show, kids come in, I invent it. 
[03:13:00]  And the English guy goes, it stinks, you young piece of garbage.  Beat it.  American kids are dumb.  So anyway, the fucking fireman.  And I have to be honest with you.  And in the beginning, I, I hated this guy because he, of course he cried.  I just want to save children and Christmas trees burn up.  6.8 people get burned by a Christmas tree.  And you're like, shut the fuck up.  You're crying fireman.  That's why you're here, nigga. 
[03:13:30]  So he had a drawing.  This is, this is, see, that's the thing.  If you, if you make something up that people touch your heart, they had a deaf woman.  That had a speaker jacket and they put her through, you know, to, to the semi.  She goes, I'm in the mean name of the people missing to music the way I do.  And she just had a speaker jacket that just, speaker jacket that vibrated a little.  Yeah, it just vibrated.  Like, you know, like, oh, now I can feel.  But her whole thing was like, she wanted people who can hear to, so everybody had a tear. 
[03:14:00]  Of course.  Fuck that.  But anyway, the Christmas tree guy, the fireman, who's going to, who can't lose.  But I hated him in the beginning because it was just a drawing.  It was an idea.  He fucking, oh, and one of the other finalists, I forgot about it.  One of the finalists was a couple who, who created, um, an adapter for coffee machines to make, um, an adapter for coffee machines to make tea. 
[03:14:30]  Because some tea.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Some tea has to be made in different temperatures.  Like, if you boil green tea water, it sucks.  You're not going to get the right taste or something.  This is for tea drinkers.  Holy niche.  And, and, and you.  Yeah, no kidding.  And so if you press, I'm making orange blossom on your thing, it'll, you know, it'll temperature the right amount of temperature to make orange blossom tea and blah, blah, blah. 
[03:15:00]  That made it through to the fucking, they got 50,000 out of that.  Can I jump in here again?  And the bite claw.  Don't forget the bite claw, guys.  Wait, wait, before you get to the bite, we're complicating things way too much if, if, if, if now you need to make tea at different temperatures.  Yeah.  We have too much fucking time on our hands.  But here.  Who the fuck came up with that one?  Do you know something?  Back in the day, you threw a few twigs and dirt in a fucking.  That's the mother of invention is laziness.  Yeah, of course. 
[03:15:30]  Think of any invention that means anything.  It's fucking lazy.  Why would we invent the escalator?  Because we're lazy.  It's lazy.  Don't want to walk up those stairs.  They only discovered recently that you need to like, you know, make tea at different temperatures.  It used to be tea, just fucking boil some water.  Boil tea.  And throw your bag in.  But they made a niche.  And don't forget the bite claw guys.  All right, bite claw.  Bite claw guys.  So no, it's like bite claw guys.  Okay, instead of you go in there and you ride a bike and you got to hang it on it. 
[03:16:00]  They just said, fuck hanging.  Which I never thought, you know, some things you go, I never thought to even go, man, I  don't need to be hanging this bike.  You never thought that?  I never thought that, like, bike hanging, right?  Yeah.  Fucking, that was good on you piece of shit.  But I don't, I rode a bike.  Hanging's not in your vocabulary.  No hanging and no bikes.  Oh, no bikes.  Matter of fact, I fucked this fucker.  He was making a fat joke.  He was making a racial joke.  That's right.  That ended up being a double fat racial joke.  Double fat.  I don't ride bikes and I don't like the word hanging. 
[03:16:30]  All right.  Fucking fucking.  How's it going, you motherfucker?  Thank you.  All right.  Thank you.  So they made a device that instead of having to lift off the thing, the hook, it's a claw  that had a button in the middle and you just lift your bike and it hits the button and  the claw just closes on it and hangs it.  Uh-huh.  And then you push it up, the claw opens, you pull it down.  It's supposed to be an easier way to just put your bike up.  And they got cursed out because they took the $50,000 and they said so, because they 
[03:17:00]  had a rough like little thing of it.  So the English guy really taught him a new asshole because he goes, so basically you took  that $50,000 and you, and you gave it a color, they made it orange and you made it smaller.  That's what you did with our $50,000, motherfucker.  And it was like, man, but they're like the guy from the fucking news.  Porky pig did.  And he's like, fuck you.  You ain't shit.  So here we go.  The fire guy.  When he first came out with his idea called Guardian Angel. 
[03:17:30]  Guardian Angel.  Guardian Angel.  Let me tell you what this is.  Go ahead.  I'm not even going to just from hearing that.  Just from hearing it.  I bet I know what it is.  Of course you do.  It's the fucking ornament on top of the tree that's hooked up to a water supply and it  sprinkles the fucking tree if it catches on fire.  Absolute.  You saw the show.  I believe he didn't.  I never, I swear to you, I've never seen it.  But it's a pipe that runs through, this is his drawing in the beginning. 
[03:18:00]  And man, remember, this is with tears.  Right.  It's the angel at the top.  Yep.  The pipe goes through the tree, comes out, and the water supply is a present.  Okay.  All right.  So it looks like a present.  It's a come through the thing, boom, present.  Okay.  Yeah.  So his drawing was, I'm going to, here's my theory.  My theory is, when a tree sets on fire, an alarm goes off, and the angel sprinkles water 
[03:18:30]  down the tree, it will save lives.  And remember, this is with crying.  Now, Pat Croce was like, he went through the tears, and he goes, this is some horse shit.  Like, everybody else is like, Lord Jesus, you're going to save lives.  And I'm sitting there going, this stinks.  Because this is just a theory.  I believe everyone should be able to travel like he tried to do from the movie The Fly.  Here's my drawing.  I want to go to New Mexico right now in a transport. 
[03:19:00]  I want the Star Trek shit to be real.  Hell yeah.  That's what his drawing was.  Oh, that's awesome, man.  We're like, shut the fuck up, fire, man.  But this motherfucker took that $50,000, and you get a development team, you get a marketing  team, you get a whatever, whatever.  He showed a video of this thing working.  Like, they showed the thing.  Now, Pat Croce goes, how many times did it take for that shit to work and all that?  He tried to, he said, eight trees, but we couldn't get this video like that because 
[03:19:30]  he had one thing was the Guardian Angel.  Tree set on fire.  Guardian Angel was spraying, alarm went off.  You just see a living family.  Other picture, in this one, Christmas tree, somebody, you know, the fire fairy comes in,  takes a shit, and they showed that tree killing everyone.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  You know, just everyone's dead in the house.  And they, his prototype with 50 G's work. 
[03:20:00]  He can't lose.  Wow, yeah.  Because it fucking worked.  And they were, they were like, holy, it's so good that they have to fuck with him some  kind of way.  The only thing they can possibly do is question the reliability of this thing saving your life.  That if it's going to work every time and, yeah, yeah.  But it can't lose, dude.  It went from, I was like a gal, like, this is bullshit.  I watched it work, and you go, you can't vote against it. 
[03:20:30]  Because last year's winner was, Bobby told me, it was a kid's seat.  Anything with safety can't lose.  It was a kid's seat that it was, it's in a round gyroscope ball, and the seat, instead  of being strapped in the car, the seat twirls around in the ball.  So if you have a car accident, instead of the fucking kid's neck snapping, blah, blah,  it just gyros, he just gyroscopes.  Oh, shit.  While the fucking family's dying, the kid is just like, yay, this is a fucking gyroscope 
[03:21:00]  spinning thing, and I'm feeling good about myself.  He won last year.  This year, the angel can't lose.  It can't lose.  Guardian angel.  It's amazing, dude.  Wow.  And you sit there, and the investment that you have in the show is the fucking, you go,  how can you say no to that, you motherfuckers?  And then you get mad because you go, George Foreman, you piece of garbage, you don't have 
[03:21:30]  nothing to do with the Foreman grill.  Yeah.  This English cop sucker who's rich from, you know, one of these guys who, he owns a yacht.  He owns 27 houses, and you go, what's he do?  I don't even fucking know.  Just a rich white boy.  Daddy's great, great grandpappy's money.  And the girl got it from stocking.  She invented something with stockings.  I don't know exactly what it is, but she ain't shit either.  And Pat Croce's a fire GM, motivational speaker.  So I'm like, fuck you guys. 
[03:22:00]  That's the investment.  Like, that's a great invention idea.  And they're like, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  It's not cheesy because it's so...  I gotta watch this show now.  It's so fucking...  It's dude.  It's some...  It's...  You're invested.  If you're into, like, the guy that sells orange glow, and if you're into late night bullshit...  Infomercials.  Dude, this show is a fucking great show.  I'll watch those stupid infomercials for hours on end.  They got that dumb one that's on now where it's some guy showing how fast you could chop 
[03:22:30]  shit up.  Just one, two, three.  And in three seconds, you have salsa.  And it's like, no.  You gotta take the shit out of the fridge.  You gotta put it in there.  You gotta chop it up.  Maybe it takes three seconds to chop it up.  Then you gotta put it in something.  You gotta get the chips.  You gotta get...  Three seconds, you have guacamole.  Guacamole.  Guacamole.  You fucking idiot.  And he's sitting in front of a bunch of people.  One old bag is smoking.  They're all obviously actors that can't do it right. 
[03:23:00]  But what if I'm having a lot of people over?  Well, then we have the expansion unit.  You can make all the guacamole you want.  Dude, we've been sitting on this for a long time.  Home Shopping Network, moments gone wrong.  Look at how we do things.  We seg right into shit.  Seg right into the dudes getting chopped up with knives.  Fucking Patrice, I'm gonna watch that show now.  I need a show to watch.  Well, obviously this is the season finale, but I need to watch a show. 
[03:23:30]  The only one I look forward to now is Rescue Me.  That's it right now.  I heard that was great.  I just never...  Rescue Me rocks.  I heard it was a great show.  Absolutely.  Home Shopping Network, moments gone wrong.  It's all about Lost.  You got Stars Network?  I got everyone, yeah.  Every single channel possible.  Watch Bronx Bunny.  Bronx Bunny?  On Stars.  What is that?  Just watch Bronx Bunny.  Hookers?  It's a fucking dirty, R-rated, puppet interview show.  And I know that sounds horrendous. 
[03:24:00]  Certainly does.  But the puppet, Bronx Bunny, and Teddy T, which is an endangered panda.  Those are the two dudes.  A dirty bunny and his endangered panda friend, Teddy T, who smokes weed and just is fucked up.  They're interviewing Chris Jericho.  Oh, shit.  They go, Chris Jericho, and Sulu, right?  You know?  Sulu.  And so the bear after Sulu says, hey, you came out the closet.  And fucking the bear goes, oh my God.  They kept you in the closet, those dirty Cleons, right? 
[03:24:30]  And he goes, no, I'm gay.  I'm a homosexual.  Oh, I think we got it.  And he goes, I'm not fucking, I'm not fucking going to say Captain's Log anymore to you,  you fucking.  He didn't call him a cocksmoker.  He goes, what do people think now that you're a cocksmoker?  So Chris Jericho, you know, Chris Jericho's got a funny, and the bunny goes, hey, so Chris,  what's it like, you know, doing what you're doing?  He goes, well, you know, the, and he started getting to this little diatribe, and the bunny 
[03:25:00]  goes, just answer the fucking question.  It's, it's the, it makes me laugh.  I think we got the clip you're talking about with George Takei.  George Takei.  Let's hear this.  How did fans take it when they heard you were a smoke out?  Holy shit.  Can we get more volume on this?  Here's the bunny, obviously.  And he says cock, there's no bleeps in it.  Yeah, no bleeps.  I don't know why they bleeped it for YouTube.  They bleeped it for YouTube, not for us, so don't give us shit, you motherfuckers.  How did fans take it when they heard you were a smoke out? 
[03:25:30]  Oh, Jesus.  And the bunny goes, oh, Jesus.  Oh, Jesus.  It's the funniest show, man.  Wow.  I'm amazed he agreed to that.  Dude, it's amazing.  I know he's got a sense of humor, but go back.  I want to hear the whole clip.  Go ahead, start right there.  How did fans take it when they heard you were a smoke out?  Oh, Jesus.  You know what?  What?  I got great support from the fans.  I got a tidal wave of e-mails. 
[03:26:00]  Great.  The jism.  The men are the ones that you should get to redecorate your apartment here in East L.A.  You know, you got a point there.  Yeah.  How can you find things in here?  I mean, you know.  Oh, we know where everything is.  No, you don't.  Yes, I do.  I can tell you there's a pile of shit over there.  Yeah.  Another pile of shit over there.  I like to be able to go to a drawer, pull it open, and get my underwear out.  I like to go to the closet and open the closet door and get...  How jumps a guy? 
[03:26:30]  Wait, go back, because then they fucking beat him up some more.  And the bunny goes...  Yeah, wait.  Take it back slightly.  I want to hear what he said after that.  All right, go.  I like to be able to go to a drawer, pull it open, and get my underwear out.  I like to go to the closet and open the closet door and get...  How jumps a guy?  You got the idea. 
[03:27:00]  You got the idea.  You got the idea.  He sounds a lot more effeminate now, doesn't he?  He was on the show with...  Remember the little girl that was in Waterworld?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Napoleon Dynamite.  And he just trashed Kevin Costner.  Really?  Because that fucking movie stunk.  Kevin Costner's a piece of shit.  He's like, no.  He's like...  All right, listen.  It's a beautiful show, man.  I'm telling you.  Ron Spunny's now on our radar.  Thank you, Patrice.  Oh, God.  Ron Spunny, dude.  We'll definitely check that one out as well.  Gotta watch it.  Gotta watch it.  We got audio of the fireman.  Is it worth playing after that big setup? 
[03:27:30]  Yeah, play the dude.  He's crying, and he's just...  Yeah, fuck the home shopping fucking network.  The fireman guy, man.  You got to understand this guy is just...  I'm saving...  And you don't want it to work because of what it...  It's too much emotions.  You go, fuck you and your saving lives.  Saving lives.  I just want to save lives.  But he just...  It's gotta win.  Has no choice to win, but to win.  All right, here it is.  Oh, by the way, thanks to Randy Barnes from New Orleans. 
[03:28:00]  Oh.  Thank you.  The setup with heart-wrenching story.  Here's the American inventor with the fireman.  My name's Greg Chavez, and my invention is the guardian angel.  It's a fire protection system for your Christmas tree.  I want to show you something that is pretty amazing.  It is footage of a Christmas tree fire consuming a living room.  Every year, children die in this country at the holiday season. 
[03:28:30]  Take a note of the time.  That's what's happening in someone's living room.  This is how I dress to come to a situation.  About 15 years ago, I was a construction worker.  It was Christmas time.  I was home and I saw a news broadcast.  And what it was, was a father running from a burning structure,  carrying his lifeless child.  He was followed closely behind by the mother. 
[03:29:00]  And looked on her face.  Take a note of the time.  Oh, that was good.  Oh, that really worked well.  That fucking laugh. 
[03:29:30]  I can't get enough of it.  Guy has to smoke 80 packs of cigarettes to laugh like that.  The big pitch.  Do we need the big pitch?  No.  All right.  Just that part.  Yeah.  It's just that.  That's the whole thing.  And you got to understand, it was a drawing that he had.  It was just an idea.  Yeah.  And like Pat Koji was just like, dude, this is.  How do you not see that, though, as being something that has some potential? 
[03:30:00]  It's kind of easy.  It's not like.  It doesn't seem like.  No, it's fucking.  It's.  Really?  It has to censor.  It's a.  It's a major piece of equipment.  There's shit out there that censors fire.  Smoke.  It's called a.  It's called a.  It's kind of wired.  It's called a smoke detector and a sprinkler.  There you go.  Yeah.  How about you just have a sprinkler system in your fucking house up right up on top of your  Christmas tree?  I.  You.  There's the.  There's the cheap version of that.  No, no, no.  No, this is the better.  This is the.  It catches it.  I guess by the time the detector might get it, it's out of control. 
[03:30:30]  Like it can't like the way those those they show those Christmas trees flaming up.  It's like it's dead very fast.  I would think you could have a sprinkler, a single sprinkler head that you get anywhere  and like you see in, you know, any building.  Put it where you keep your Christmas tree every year.  Put it right there.  And then pipe it into your plumbing.  That's what you do.  Now you hook a valve up.  How about put it in the bathtub? 
[03:31:00]  You hook a valve up to a smoke detector.  How about buy a fake one that's fucking not flammable?  How about you just put your Christmas tree in the shower and just keep the water off?  Why do you have to buy a real one?  Buy the fake one that we used to buy.  Real ones smell good.  And put it together.  They smell good.  Buy a fake one and some pine salt.  Smoke detector to a valve right over it.  And then you put your Christmas tree there.  Now you can put any type of top decoration you want.  Your Christmas tree could be any height you want it to be.  It's underneath the fucking sprinkler.  You should be on the show.  There you go. 
[03:31:30]  I think his idea does suck ass.  As a judge.  It would be fantastic.  Jesus.  For what I could get down at Granger for about 50 bucks.  I could pipe a fucking house for that.  And see what you said?  Like, just the sense of that?  No one said, why have sprinklers then?  Yeah.  I don't get it.  All right.  Hey, people are bringing it up on his feedback.  We don't really have much on it.  Do you watch Little People, Big World?  Oh, that fucker got arrested.  That fucker. 
[03:32:00]  Matt Rollo.  That little fucker.  That little fella.  For drunk driving, right?  Yeah, DUI.  But we read the story, and you think, you know, this guy's an alky.  It's said in the story that it only takes two beers.  Who the fuck could drink only two beers?  He gets a Dewey from two beers?  Two beers.  Because when you see these DUI stories, you're like, wow.  His body is no bigger than a pint.  He has a pint of body.  Driving while insignificant.  I think they should let him go. 
[03:32:30]  Two beers?  Fuck that.  Two fucking beers.  Give the guy a break.  Arrest that.  No one could drink two beers.  Arrest that little person.  Yeah.  Put him in the clink.  Yeah.  The little guy.  Put him in a special.  A doggy kennel.  A doggy kennel.  Put him in a little doggy kennel box.  Next to the real jail, so the fucking people can make fun of him.  Arrest that motherfucker.  Make him wheel around the fucking prison.  He made bail.  And his eye.  And you squeeze your thumbs together to open up the front.  And a little baby Segway. 
[03:33:00]  He's rolling around the prison yard.  With a little baby Segway and a sharpened toothbrush in.  What was he driving?  A Barbie dream car?  One of those fucking.  He was probably driving his mule.  A battery operated Hummer.  Yeah.  One of those battery powered Hummers.  You get the kids.  He hit a tree.  Nothing happened.  He's just sending that little fucker right to prison.  I have no remorse for him.  Why?  Because he's little and there's two fucking beers.  If it takes two beers for you to get drunk, then you should be free to go. 
[03:33:30]  That poor bastard.  Yeah, but tell on earth.  How do you wrap those little sausage fingers around the bottle?  Did he have to hold the beer with two hands?  Looks like he's drinking a 40.  It's a pony.  It's a Bud Pony.  With those little Simpson hands?  Yeah.  Little Simpson hands.  Little three finger hands.  Screw him.  He should go right to jail.  Put him in.  No remorse to the low fella.  Put him in the jail.  Fuck him.  Hey, what about the TV show about the kids?  Is that happening like today? 
[03:34:00]  Which one?  The concept is they have a bunch of kids like in the desert or something or an old ghost.  Oh yeah, this is some kind of fucking like Lord of the Flies shit they're pulling.  They're doing Lord of the Flies without the crazy shit.  It's like a, it's called Kid Nation.  Thank you, Jason.  Yeah, Kid Nation.  Oh, so it's like survival with children?  Yeah, yeah.  They take a bunch of kids.  They put them in this like old, it looks like an old western set, but it's apparently  an old ghost town called Bonanza.  Can I interrupt real fast because we might be able to get the clip on before we leave 
[03:34:30]  here today?  Someone, Dan, help me out.  Jason writes, hey, here's a show that's going to take off, Kid Nation, okay?  Go to this website.  The audio rules.  There's kids crying about missing their wheelchair-bound brothers.  Good.  Can you maybe find that clip real fast, see if there's anything to it?  Sorry, Ed.  They say the whole thing, the whole slug line with them is that there's no adults.  It's just kids.  But that's impossible. 
[03:35:00]  Because they show these kids, and they show some kids that are really young, and they show  like girls and boys, some cute, some ugly.  And then they show this one kid that looked a little too old to be there.  You know, he's got like braces on, and he looked like the guy that's going to be the  troublemaker.  And I could just see, like, there's got to be parental supervision or some kind of like  supervision there.  Or this kid's just going to go fucking sexually assaulting all the girls in the place.  They just looked like trouble.  They had like long hair and like a wool cap. 
[03:35:30]  How old are the kids?  Like 10?  It looked like they were anywhere from 7 to maybe 13.  And there's no outcry or outrage about this show?  I don't know.  I don't know what their whole thing is.  That's all I kind of caught of it.  But I did see some kids crying, and I saw like an argument between some, and one kid  like trying to take the lead.  And, you know, I don't know how it's going to work out, or if there's adults there to  keep things from getting out of control. 
[03:36:00]  I would think that'd have to be.  Kids would kill them.  It would be great to just dump kids there with a camera and watch them just literally  kill each other.  Because kids are stupid.  They don't understand.  You think we'll ever get to that point?  We're going to hang you because you stole the candy.  What do you say, guys?  Okay.  You think they'd do that and then not realize what they did?  Do you think we'll ever get to that point?  They tease that like with movies and stuff, with reality shows, where you just let a bunch  of prisoners.  What was the movie where you let a bunch of prisoners on an island?  Yeah, like Escape from New York or something. 
[03:36:30]  And they just, but for real, like a reality show where for real, they're like.  Yeah, that'd be great.  No rules whatsoever.  Do you think we'll ever get to that point in this society?  Yeah, probably.  Yeah.  When, like regular TV loses so much revenue to all the really outrageous shit, then they'll  realize, okay, we got to do something.  All right, now we got to kill people.  Yeah.  For real.  Got to start maybe killing people.  They'll probably start with like just broadcasting executions.  Yeah, it's always been a hot button.  They won't do that.  They'll find out a way to make that make sense. 
[03:37:00]  You know, because I was actually watching live the last killing of someone on live TV.  It was weird.  It changed my life kind of.  Really?  Yeah.  Where the fuck did you say that?  It, I was in LA and it was that fucking, the gay guy that was against HMOs.  He had AIDS and he tried to burn his dog up.  Oh yeah.  Remember that?  No.  You don't remember? 
[03:37:30]  He, he was against the HMOs.  He was on the highway.  How was he against HMOs?  Wait a minute.  No, no.  He was gay.  Oh, oh.  HMOs.  Not homos.  H-O-M-O.  He was a homo who was against HMOs.  So he, here's the, it was something funny happening, but he, he tried to burn himself  up like the monk in, uh.  Oh shit.  Oh, that video.  In, in Vietnam.  That takes a lot of guts.  He didn't realize how hot fire was.  That fucking shit hurts, right?  So this fucker had him and his dog in the car and burn, he tried to burn the dog up 
[03:38:00]  in him in the protest.  He lit the thing and you saw the fire?  Good idea.  This motherfucker was, he said, oh shit, I didn't realize fire was this hot.  Fire hurts.  So he jumped out of the car.  And it'll hurt before you die.  He comes, he jumps out the car butt naked on fire because he rips his clothes off.  So he's running around in this weird circle on the bridge.  He jumps on the top of the bridge and goes, shit, if I jump, I might not die.  It'll be just like this fire shit I just pulled.  Now his dog is burned up in the fucking truck, by the way. 
[03:38:30]  He goes to the back of the, they're just filming this disaster.  He goes to the bed, it's live.  Goes to the back of his pickup truck.  I am remembering this now.  Gets the fucking shot.  Oh yeah, now I remember.  And just blows his brains out right live.  It was like, did I just watch a guy die right now?  Did you have it on DVR?  Were you able to rewind, watch it a few times?  No, this was like five years.  Oh.  Why the fuck would that affect you?  Because it was like, it was, he was living, it happened exactly when I was alive. 
[03:39:00]  Like, just watching someone's life expire right then was, it fucked me up a little bit.  Like, you know, it was just.  They'll do shit like that though.  And I think reality programming with dead people, the first thing they'll do is some  kind of a story where they have somebody maybe terminally ill, only has a little time left.  You get to know the family.  They do it like that.  And then they'll have like them in the hospital when the person dies.  And that will be your first thing where you're there and the person's dead. 
[03:39:30]  Did you see that Stone Cold Steve Austin movie?  I didn't see it, but the idea of that is 10 people on death row fight to the end.  That's what I was referring to.  Well, that'd be great.  Very vaguely, obviously.  That'd be cool.  That's what I was referring to.  As far as reality shows go.  Are we ready for the line of the day?  What?  What happened?  What, E-Rock?  E-Rock, what happened?  E-Rock.  E-Rock, what happened?  Don't forget, Jim Norton on Jimmy Kimmel tonight.  Yes.  Patrice O'Neill playing DC Improv August 10th, 11th, and 12th. 
[03:40:00]  There you go.  August 10th, 11th, and 12th.  You see the clip on, it was on break, but it's one of my favorite now.  I can't get enough of it.  It's two of these animals in the Middle East, and they're setting up some kind of bazooka rig or something.  It's two guys, and they put the barrel on, and they're both holding it down, and they're going,  Oh, Laakbar, Oh, Laakbar, Oh, Laakbar, and they hit this thing to make it fire, and it explodes right there under them, and they go into pieces. 
[03:40:30]  Just pieces of them go flying.  This is on YouTube?  Oh, it's on break.  Break.  It is fantastic.  What's the search?  Allah Akbar, Allah Akbar, boom!  Just pieces of them fly all over the place.  What's the search on that one?  I don't know.  Two savages explode.  Exploding savages. 
[03:41:00]  Exploding savages.  And then you'll see Apocalypto.  Exploding, um...  Don't give me that exploding whale shitting.  No, no.  Did you see Apocalypto?  Uh, no, I haven't seen that one yet.  Have you seen Apocalypto?  I got...  It's on my on-demand.  I've watched way more movies than I did.  Did you find it, Iraq?  Failed missile launch?  This might be it.  Not Javelin?  No, that's Javelin.  That ain't it.  That's boring.  Get the goddamn, uh, like, uh, I think it was Al-Qaeda, or Taliban.  Taliban, maybe. 
[03:41:30]  How about bazooka explodes in faith?  I know.  Taliban, uh, missile.  They're really simple on YouTube.  Two...  It might be on the two savages, fuck-up bazookas firing.  Trying to launch a rocket.  How does this not get five stars, by the way?  Of course it should.  It gets three out of five stars?  What problem could that...  Not that ain't it either.  Oh, that's why.  Jesus Christ.  All right.  The fuck?  Me over there.  Jesus.  Let me take a look.  Steve gave, uh...  Oh, he did?  All right.  Here we go.  Let me see.  Let's swing this fucking mic around. 
[03:42:00]  All right.  Let me tell...  No, that's the same one.  Oh, Steve.  Stupid Steve.  Scroll down.  God damn it.  No.  Missile.  Two savages, fuck-up.  I know.  I wish I knew what the friggin' name was.  Dirty Aras, fuck-up.  And it's like 10 million videos.  Al-Qaeda.  Dude.  You don't know how to spell Al-Qaeda.  When all else fails, go to PalTalk.  Someone must have it by now.  Come on, you fuckers.  What's the...  Where is it?  Exploding savages.  What's the, uh... 
[03:42:30]  What's the search on this one?  These guys are so into it.  And you know how they chant?  Oh, Lord, boy!  Like, they're so into it.  And then they're just gone.  They just were...  They were standing there, and then they're vaporized completely.  And then the 78 versions of whatever.  Yeah.  And they're like, yo, look.  And the guy doesn't even like...  You know when shit happens here, and someone's videotaping it, and something horrible happens,  they move the camera?  Like, you never see the result.  This guy just kept filming the pieces of them.  Because he's probably saying, hey, that's what we do.  Yeah, that's our gig. 
[03:43:00]  That's how we do it, baby.  You don't know how to spell Al-Qaeda?  Oh, boy.  We'll die for practice.  Yeah.  No, that ain't it.  Oh, boy.  Jesus H. Christ.  Taliban fails to launch rocket.  We got that one?  All right.  That's the one that people keep showing.  Yeah.  That's the stupid one.  Oh, okay.  I get the one where they explode.  I'm sorry.  Put ex...  You know...  We're not going anywhere until we find this.  Taliban explodes.  Just put explode. 
[03:43:30]  How about put their words, two squiggly lines, a dot.  How about...  Goes boom.  A fucking...  Looks like a W.  No, boom ain't gonna work.  Taliban.  Fuck Taliban.  Put Al-Qaeda.  Figure it out.  Q.  A moon with a star in it.  There's no U after Al-Qaeda.  Oh, Q.  Nothing there.  Savage language.  Put...  Put in Rich Voss.  Put...  Put first you're here and now you're not. 
[03:44:00]  That's a bomb.  That was a good bombing joke.  Come on.  Rich Voss.  Actually, something comes up.  They haven't given you the link yet?  No.  Oh, boy.  Anthony, you made that shit up.  I swear I didn't.  That was in your dream.  Launch...  Put launch...  Missile launch.  No.  Thanks for...  Put missile launch.  That's that one. 
[03:44:30]  Keep going.  Keep going.  That's it.  That's it?  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  This is annoying me.  He didn't see nothing.  Anthony has dementia.  No.  No.  I saw it.  Rocket.  Rocket.  No.  Put rocket explode.  Put rocket.  Neil Armstrong comes up.  Mentos rocket to the face?  Of course not.  Enough of the Mentos videos.  Which is...  Come on.  Let's go.  Failed missile launch? 
[03:45:00]  No, right?  Toilet exploding?  Al-Qaeda.  They just spelt it on PalTalk.  All right.  How do you spell Al-Qaeda?  Go back.  Go back.  Oh, okay.  All right.  Let's go.  A-L-Q-U-A.  Come on.  Yay.  All right.  Let's try that.  Oh, Q-U-A.  Sorry.  Al-Qaeda.  How about boomy pow pow?  Try that.  I think that comes up.  I am so fucking pissed you can't find this fucking thing. 
[03:45:30]  You were lying in the first place.  Why did you even lie?  No, it's great.  Put in Acme Explosives.  No, it won't work.  Put in Stewie from the Family Guy.  No, don't put in Acme Explosives.  It ain't gonna work.  Put in the Roadrunner.  Acme Explosives.  Anthony, what is this fiasco?  It's a total fiasco.  Oh, terrorist.  Oh, that might work.  Damn it.  Put in Yosemite sand. 
[03:46:00]  No.  Ooh, you varmint.  Right.  Come on.  Now I gotta go back to the ship and get another match.  Son of a bitch.  Yeah.  All right, go fuck yourself.  Put in a picture of Batman with the words Kaboom over the punch.  He just...  I bet...  I bet I find it in a second.  Then you'll be sorry.  Then you'll all be sorry.  Just look for your lies.  Yeah, we need to see it now.  All right, let's do a runner-up line of the day. 
[03:46:30]  You think you could do that, E-Rock?  Yeah.  All right.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Here's your runner-up line of the day.  Go.  Oh, great.  It's not playing.  Yeah.  Nah.  What happened?  Mm-hmm.  It's not playing, or are you not playing?  Mm-hmm.  Oh.  La-da-da-da-dum.  And it's trying to find that.  No.  Is it playing or what?  That ain't it.  Who sent that link?  What?  You know, people that start sending links of the fake fucking sniper thing. 
[03:47:00]  That ain't really a sniper.  No.  I'll keep trying other people's links, but...  Well, they might have removed it.  No.  That ain't it either, dumbass.  You're taking a gamble, sending me links.  With everyone that's wrong, I'm gonna ban you.  Well, the stupid sniper footage that ain't really a sniper.  It's some guy hunting fucking groundhogs.  What's not playing? 
[03:47:30]  Runner-up line of the day is not playing?  Damn it.  Who had runner-up line of the day?  Oh, it doesn't matter.  Damn.  Hey.  Try, um...  Meatspin.com.  Fuck, I wanna see it now.  I know.  Who doesn't?  Someone's saying training videos.  That...  It can't be that easy.  Failed missile launch.  That ain't it either.  You know, augrish.com.  Remember augrish?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  They changed it to something called LiveLeak. 
[03:48:00]  If you go to augrish, it'll come up LiveLeak and it'll have the same kind of videos.  It might be on there.  Yeah.  That same type of shit.  You can give it a shot.  That's a dumb...  I am really mad.  I'll find this in a second.  Uh, put in Lemon Party.  Yeah.  Lemon Party.  No?  Yeah.  Put in Lemon Party.  I'll put in Lemon Party.  All right.  Put in Lemon Party.  Ah, there it is.  There's a lot of blowing going on in that video. 
[03:48:30]  Chechen.  Chechen terrorist.  Dude, what about Lemon Party?  C-H-E...  There it is.  There's a lot of blowing going on.  All right.  You ready?  C-H-E-C-H-E-N.  Chechen terrorist.  See, you blamed it on fucking Arabs and it was just...  They're still animals.  They're still Muslim, crazy animal, uh, ready to kill, uh, people.  Thanks.  All right.  You see it?  Uh, no.  No.  Are you kidding me?  I searched.  Yeah.  Out of...  All right.  Go to vidmax.com. 
[03:49:00]  Yeah, vidmax is a good one.  That'll have it.  Yep.  Okay.  Here it is.  And...  All right.  And then put that in the search.  Oh!  Oh, that had a hurt.  Wait, I haven't seen it.  Oh, they just come apart.  They just...  They just vaporized.  Oh, I want to see it.  You put Chechen in the...  Really?  Go to vidmax.com?  That's where it is?  Yeah.  All right.  And type Chechen in the search.  And then Chechen...  Chechen terrorists prepare to blow themselves, blah, blah, blah. 
[03:49:30]  All right.  All right.  There it is.  Hit that one.  All right.  Uh-huh.  Now get the sound up.  Jesus, they're gone.  Yeah, they just disappear.  Here we go.  Great music.  Damn, Russians.  This is some Russian-type motherfuckers.  What the fuck?  How cool is that?  Holy shit.  Is that real? 
[03:50:00]  Yep.  Wow.  Steve, is it real?  Yes, it is.  Oh, okay.  Steve dubbed it real, so it has to be real.  Go to vidmax.com and throw in Chechen.  But they were gone.  You didn't even know if they were gone.  Just vaporized.  You saw a piece of meat, like, kind of fall down, which was, like, probably the guy's  spine.  All right.  Let's go.  We got to go.  With something attached to the ribs.  I don't want to go home.  I don't want to go home.  Runner-up line of the day.  Go.  No bowed instruments.  We shouldn't have a roadie yelling, he needs rosin. 
[03:50:30]  Quick, more rosin.  Rosin.  Very good.  And finally, Patrice, thank you so much.  Patriceoneal.com.  When are you doing Black Phillip again?  We're working that out.  Uh-oh.  You're on to us, finally.  You need money.  Oh, fuck. 
[03:51:00]  Oh, shit.  I knew this day would come.  Hey, dude, don't blame me.  There's no one working at XM anymore.  We don't hear from nobody.  Until this merger goes through, no one even knows if they have jobs down there.  And that's the truth.  We don't hear from anybody.  So you guys are doing, like, almost like a pirate radio show right now?  Yeah, no one pays attention.  I swear to you.  I swear to you.  At this point, we could come on, you know, the exclusive XM part.  Do 15 minutes, go home.  No one is going to question it. 
[03:51:30]  No one.  It is bad right now.  Are you sure it's on?  That's a good question.  Are we even on the air?  Did somebody call just to make sure it's on?  I mean, we joke about it, but it's a weird time right now.  Until this merger either goes through or doesn't go through.  It's just everyone's kind of just in a...  Is it just been us three?  I don't know.  Is it just a room full of people?  Talking ourselves.  It's just kind of a standstill right now.  That's the feeling I get.  I'm sure there's people working hard down there, but I don't really...  It's weird.  It's a weird time right now. 
[03:52:00]  Yeah.  Oof.  All right, here's your line of the day.  Here comes the line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  No more bands wearing Lane Bryant.  Oh, it's Steven Carr.  Of Foundry. 
[03:52:30]  Of Foundry.  When I play...  The song Pendulum comes on.  When we play Pendulum.  Too busy being queer.  Line of the day goes to a instant feedbacker.  I don't know who sent that in anymore, but that was your line of the day.  Very good.  Good job at the instant feedback today.  All right.  Guys, thank you so much.  Yes.  Hey, we found the Godsmack drum solo.  I don't know if it's worth it.  Subject people to a drum solo.  Jesus Christ. 
[03:53:00]  Yeah, we'll leave it with this.  An awesome drum solo from Godsmack.  Yeah.  Give it a chance.  It's Opie and Anthony.  We'll see you guys tomorrow.  Ron and Fez up at noon.  We'll see you next time.  We'll see you next time.  We'll see you next time.  We'll see you next time.  We'll see you next time.  We'll see you next time.  We'll see you next time.  We'll see you next time.  We'll see you next time.  We'll see you next time.  We'll see you next time.  We'll see you next time.  We'll see you next time.  We'll see you next time.  We'll see you next time.  We'll see you next time.  We'll see you next time.  We'll see you next time.  We'll see you next time.  We'll see you next time.  We'll see you next time.
