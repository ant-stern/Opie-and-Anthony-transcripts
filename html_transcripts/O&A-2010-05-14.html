<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show opened with Anthony recounting his bizarre and offensive watermelon-eating habits, employing numerous racial slurs and stereotypes in the process. This sparked a discussion about the racist history and imagery associated with watermelons.  The conversation then pivoted to a review of a previous show featuring Penthouse pet Jade Vixen.  The hosts dissected their failure to adequately research Vixen's background, which included the murder of her boyfriend by a stalker.  Significant blame was placed on the show's research team, with Anthony ultimately shouldering responsibility and Jimmy Norton, absent from the studio, receiving considerable criticism for the oversight.  

Next, the show delved into a graphic discussion of female hygiene, specifically vaginal odor. This segment included several listener calls contributing to the explicit and offensive conversation, comparing and contrasting male and female hygiene practices with crude humor.

The show then transitioned to promoting the upcoming "Cherry Darts" segment.  The hosts announced Jim Florentine, Colin Quinn, and Penthouse's Ryan Keeley as guests.  Details of preparations, including purchasing cherries and plastic, were shared. The broadcast concluded with Anthony relating a humorous, albeit crude, anecdote about a Fleshlight and his ex-wife. Throughout the entire show, the hosts engaged in continuous banter, exchanging jokes and insults.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  The Opie and Anthony show on the virus.  Sirius XM.  I ate a half a watermelon the other day.  Just a half.  And I'm very meticulous how I eat my watermelon.  I eat it, I half it up, eat it, right?  And I scrape it, and then I keep the juices at the bottom.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You make a little bowl out of it.  A big cup of giant watermelon juice.  I embarrass black people.  Have you seen me eat watermelon while I'm alone?  Like, here, if I order something, it's all chopped up. 
[00:00:30]  If you see me eating watermelon, it should come with big eyes.  It should come with D.W. Griffin should be in there just going, mm, mm, mm.  And they mad at me for what?  It looks like a fucking 1920s poster for watermelons.  I'm telling you, I'm a complete pic-a-nitty when I'm eating.  I am a fucking dirty slave when I'm eating watermelon.  I'm just, it's that watermelon sound.  It's just, that sound, and it's all on my shirt. 
[00:01:00]  I'm telling you, it's horrid if you see me eating watermelon by myself.  That video would do real well if you want to shoot it.  Fuck you.  Al Sharpton would fucking remove me from the annals.  Obama would call me.  Nigga, what you doing?  What's up?  I'm like, man, it's just delicious.  Yeah, what are you doing?  You brought us back.  I'm not president.  What the fuck are you doing?  I've been thinking about, sometimes I was sitting there and it'll be resting on my stomach,  the watermelon. 
[00:01:30]  And I've been thinking about, how bad is the rind?  Like, can you, is it really poison?  Can you eat it?  That's what I heard about.  I just want to take a bite out of that fucking green rind.  You get too close, it tastes like cucumber.  What?  It's not even that good.  It's not filling.  What is it?  Watermelon's not even that good.  I never liked watermelon.  It's the greatest fruit ever.  I love it.  It's average.  It's fucking, it's the only fruit.  Not even in my top ten.  You rub your hands like this, like, ah, I rub them together and go, I'm going to, this  is a good looking watermelon.  How about we don't look up watermelon pictures on the internet while I'm going to show you 
[00:02:00]  this year.  But this Sambo thing, right?  This whole Sambo thing and shit.  It's Sambo brand watermelon.  I don't like how a delicious fruit has become the moniker of racism against, I don't give  a fuck.  Because the best way to eat it is just like a slave.  I don't give a fuck.  Or not like a slave, because I bet you fucking slaves, because we don't know, I guarantee  slaves ate watermelon with some class.  Like dainty, a little dainty.  I bet you, you know, the slave master just came and, put that fork and knife down, nigga. 
[00:02:30]  And they take pieces and they go, shove it in your face, quick, nigga.  It probably, every bad eating habit we have is from slavery, because you get a 15 second  break and they give you watermelon.  Ready, nigga?  Eat those, eat those, eat those pigs, the pig's feet.  Here's what we going to do.  You've seen the Petey Green video by now.  Petey Green.  Hold on, let me pop this up.  God bless him.  God bless Petey Green.  This is the greatest video ever. 
[00:03:00]  Petey Green's great.  Think twice before you answer.  Think twice before you say yes.  He shows you how to eat it.  I know y'all saying yes and that.  Look at this fool.  Got this watermelon here.  The reason why I say think twice is because...  Give me a little air.  Give me a little air, y'all.  He's got newspapers.  The reason why I say think twice is because I just can't understand how we as black people  start eating watermelon in the closet. 
[00:03:30]  In the closet.  In the closet, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Lord have mercy.  Lord have mercy.  The O.B.  Anthony Show starts now.  Previously on O&A.  What did you think of the episode of Lost, Jim?  I liked what they did with it.  The acting of the...  You know, it was about Jacob and it turns out the guy was his brother.  What?  The one who played the mother throughout the episode, like the one who smashed the real 
[00:04:00]  mother with a rock.  Yeah.  Stunk!  Yeah.  They are pulling these women out of their asses that have no acting skills whatsoever.  I mean fucking horrendous.  Like her, Zoe, they have some terrible actors on this show.  Jacob Beans!  Last October, in the Queen's office, a TLC judge accused Chicho of grabbing her thigh  and buttocks while they were in the office alone. 
[00:04:30]  His aide had gone to file papers.  His arm moved and he hit her.  His arm moved and he hit her.  Yeah.  Did you intend to hit her?  Hell, die!  Holy shit.  Don't talk to this guy when there's a full moon.  I've told you.  I like to make a werewolf attorneys.  Do you know how bad I would be with Twitter and texting if I was still drinking? 
[00:05:00]  You know what?  Fuck it, man.  It's just a cock.  I'll send out a picture for fucking everybody.  Steve Blatter's getting pictures of him.  You're fucking metal.  Oh, it's my work email.  Do you want to smell not half a penis?  No, what?  One of the best things about smoking was if there was a situation, a stressful situation,  you got a bad phone call or something, and you light a cigarette up and take the biggest 
[00:05:30]  drag, you just, just a giant drag into your lungs.  We're all going to smoke after the show.  I know, we're all just going to go out and buy cigarettes.  Yeah, I can't smoke until we're all quitting again sometimes.  Opie and Anthony, live next.  Opie and Anthony, live next. 
[00:06:00]  Thank you. 
[00:06:30]  Thank you. 
[00:07:00]  Thank you. 
[00:07:30]  Thank you. 
[00:08:00]  Thank you. 
[00:08:30]  Thank you. 
[00:09:00]  Thank you. 
[00:09:30]  Freedom of fucking speech, like we've said many times, the freedom to say some awful  things.  You might not like it, but we have the right to say them.  Oh, my.  We have low self-esteem as a show.  They are not doing anything.  They're not highly skilled.  They have no talent.  We are just exploiting people.  See, kids?  Smoke your pot.  Play your video games and watch TV.  You'll be better off when you get our age.  There's no ratings here.  There's no ratings here.  There's no ratings here.  There's no ratings here.  There's no ratings here.  No one cares.  Enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:10:00]  It's the show on the road.  Show's on the road.  Hi, everybody.  Good morning.  Opie, Anthony, and Jimmy show.  Less Opie and Jimmy.  Oops.  Yeah, Jimmy's out.  He went to Los Angeles.  Los Angeles. 
[00:10:30]  To do the Jay Leno show.  The Tonight Show, it's called now, I think.  Right?  That's something new.  I know.  But he had to go through that little thing where it was just kind of the Jay Leno show.  We all want to forget that, I guess.  Yeah, he's doing the Tonight Show.  It did it or something.  I guess he flew out yesterday.  Yeah.  And I guess he's on.  I don't even know.  Is he on tonight?  Or was he on tonight?  He's on tonight. 
[00:11:00]  He's on tonight?  I don't even know.  Catch Jimmy tonight on The Tonight Show.  Yes.  So, yeah, we got a big day, though.  So don't fret.  I believe at, like, 7 o'clock, we got Florentine coming in.  Jim Florentine.  Colin Quinn's in at 7.30.  And we have Bob Kelly coming in at 7 also.  But the big news today, the big news, regardless of who isn't here, the important thing is who will be here. 
[00:11:30]  And that is...  Girls' buttholes.  Girls' asses.  Yes.  They're bung holes.  Girls' bungy holes.  Cherry darts today.  Cherry darts.  I see people already saying, is this a compound show?  Yes, it is.  I was just telling Danny that.  We pretty much got an hour of a compound show.  Yeah, luckily I don't have to stare lazily into a camera. 
[00:12:00]  Yeah, no camera, though.  That's good.  And unfortunately, no beer.  That is unfortunate.  But, yeah, we got cherry darts today, which is kind of odd when you think about it.  We had planned this.  We had to cancel it once because of lack of interest, I think.  It was actually lack of a working email address, which was, wow.  That was a drop the ball.  But we got through it.  We got through it.  It's okay. 
[00:12:30]  I got a new date for it, which is today.  And I find myself alone.  Alone on cherry dart day.  When it's such a huge event for the program.  Opie, of course, out with child.  With the young Hudson Hughes.  Hudson Hughes.  Any middle name on that one?  I don't know.  I don't know if there was a middle name.  But Opie and his lovely wife out. 
[00:13:00]  Opie's taking a week sabbatical.  I always like that word.  And he'll be back Monday.  So no fears there.  James Norton will be back Monday also.  So it's cherry darts today with Jim Florentine and Colin Quinn.  And Ryan Keeley.  Yeah, she'll be coming in and playing cherry darts as well.  Playing cherry darts as well.  Yes, she's from Penthouse.  And apparently, wow, what a tragic past she had. 
[00:13:30]  I think something happened.  She had a stalker that wound up killing her boyfriend.  No.  Oh, you're getting mixed up.  Oh, wait, that's right.  That was the Penthouse guest we had yesterday that we didn't ask anything about that.  Holy mother of Christ.  What a full paw that was.  I know a certain Mr. Jimmy Norton was none too happy about the research that went on yesterday on our guest. 
[00:14:00]  What was her name?  Jade Vixen from Penthouse.  Jade Vixen.  Yes.  The lovely Jade Vixen.  And we were sitting here asking her questions about her tits and her shaved pussy and all that stuff, which is fine.  So you like to wear rubber?  Yeah.  So the rubber suit, does it come up to the neck?  You like to pee on people? 
[00:14:30]  Yeah.  So what's the technique?  Explain it to Jimmy, the technique of pissing in a man's mouth.  And then Jimmy was like, the name sounded familiar.  So I Googled it.  And one of the first things that came up was the fact that she had a boyfriend who was a bodybuilder.  And she also had a stalker, which is never good.  And the stalker killed the bodybuilder boyfriend, kidnapped Jade Vixen. 
[00:15:00]  And then shot himself in the head.  Maybe something you'd want to touch on with the guest.  Even though she's into rubber and pissing and took all her clothes off and showed her shaved vagina.  Kind of an important thing, I think.  Would have been fun to maybe ask her about that. 
[00:15:30]  But who wound up taking the big hit on that?  Because I got the call from Jimmy.  Jimmy was very angry.  I'm more of a, I'm more from the school of thought of, all right, there was a fuck up.  It's in the past.  What are you going to do about it?  And then I was trying to tell Jimmy, she probably wouldn't have talked about it anyway.  Like it was probably, although the publicist usually comes up to you and says, hey, don't mention this, that, or the other thing when there's some sensitive issue.  But no one said don't mention it to us, but we just didn't mention it out of, we didn't know it. 
[00:16:00]  Which Jimmy said was probably one of the most embarrassing moments he had been partied to in radio.  So, I know he made, he dropped some emails, made some phone calls.  Who, in the end, took the big hit for not putting that on a prep sheet?  I did.  Steve Carlisi. 
[00:16:30]  I got the phone call before the email went out.  Now, is that because, like, in the army, you know, if the fucking Louie is there, the lieutenant's there, and they're in combat, and something goes awry because some PFC fucks things up.  Yes.  You know, the lieutenant's going to take the shit.  It doesn't matter who fucked up.  It's my responsibility.  All right.  I know one thing about responsibility, but who's the one that fucked up?  Who's the one that usually. 
[00:17:00]  I can't, I don't even, I can't even place blame on one person.  Nobody caught it.  All right.  I can't place blame.  The, he's, what I got yesterday was such an earful that was so scattergunned at everyone.  But, well, obviously, I think also.  Isn't there somebody that is in charge of backgrounds and, and that's it.  Yeah.  Who does it every time we have a guest and we get a little one sheet on the guest?  It's usually, it's usually Sam that does it.  All right.  I'm not, but you know what?  I didn't ask Sam to do a prep sheet on her. 
[00:17:30]  I did a quick plug sheet on her.  Oh, shit.  So.  Oh, he dodged the bullet.  He's like the guy that didn't get on the plane in the crash.  Yeah, he dodged the bullet.  And I'm not throwing him under the bus.  I'm not.  I said, I said, look, you want to yell, and this is what I told Jimmy yesterday, you want  to yell, yell at me.  My prime, like, I was so distracted by all the stuff that was going on today and prepping  for all this stuff and getting people.  Cherry tars.  Buying cherries and plastic.  No, not necessarily, there's a lot of, there's a lot of stuff that just had to get done.  And I didn't even realize that that was the same girl. 
[00:18:00]  When I saw the article, I saw it.  I was like, oh my God, that was the same chick.  That's an oopsie.  It was a, holy shit, I feel like shit for missing that.  Yeah, here was the phone call I got.  Anthony.  How the fuck did they miss the fact that her boyfriend was fucking murdered?  You know, these guys, they got, they got, they got to, Anthony, they got to look at some 
[00:18:30]  shit.  They got to look at more shit.  I don't, I'm, I'm, I'm, I was fucking embarrassed.  Jimmy was very angry.  That was nicer than the one I got.  Oh, really?  That was nicer than the one I got.  It was very embarrassed.  No, he was, he was mad at everybody.  He said, I'm not even, and, and, and don't, don't get me wrong.  Reasonably so.  Yeah, I'm not saying, I'm not saying.  And I will, let me, let me also say this.  I will sit here as one of the hosts of the program and not think it shouldn't have been 
[00:19:00]  one of our responsibility also to perhaps look at who the guests are that coming in.  Not, not take just all the responsibility and place it on the staff.  If we have someone coming in, perhaps I have a computer right in front of me.  I think I should pop up Google, put the name in and see if anything pertinent is in recent  news or, you know, something that happened that might be interesting to bring up.  So I too will accept some of the blame. 
[00:19:30]  Nobody caught it.  I had to give him a focal point.  So I let it be me.  And I said, look, get mad at me.  I said, I'm the one who has to be the executive producer.  I'm the one you want to yell.  That's how you executive produce.  No, it's not.  It's not.  No, it's not.  And I felt like shit about it.  I'll be completely honest.  I felt like shit.  I got the call.  He was fucking livid.  He was livid at everybody.  And I was like, I know I said, look, yell at me, yell at me. 
[00:20:00]  You want to get mad?  Yell at me.  And I said, I'm a personal apology.  And well, it's in the past.  Thank you, Steve.  You're welcome.  And so but you'll hear, I'm sure, from Jimmy about that on Monday.  I don't think Jimmy's not a cool down over just a couple of days kind of guy.  Once he sits down in here, he'll be.  But if you'll notice this and vinegar, the two page prep sheet.  Yes.  On Ryan.  On Ryan.  Anything we should know about any murders?  No, nothing that tragic. 
[00:20:30]  Nothing that tragic.  Only that she's doing a sex opinion or an expert opinion on sex advice in the latest issue of Penthouse magazine.  Oh, boy.  One of these.  I'm from the school of thought where it's take your fucking clothes off if you're in Penthouse and keep your fucking mouth shut.  Usually.  Sometimes that could be interesting if perhaps their boyfriend was murdered. 
[00:21:00]  But otherwise, I don't find them very, you know, just because they take their clothes off in magazines that they're sex experts.  Something on an orgasm there.  Coming first and thinking you're done.  That's always good.  As a guy.  And don't ask for a sandwich.  Don't ask for a sandwich.  As a guy, when you come, when you orgasm me, you're pretty much done. 
[00:21:30]  You lose interest really quickly in the whole situation.  That's why.  I mean, I don't know what other people's techniques are out there.  But, like, something that I like to do is spend a lot of time making sure that it happens for her first.  Yes.  Or at least get halfway there so that you know that she'll be finished when you're finished.  Because if you could time it where you're both finishing at the same time, it really is a pretty cool thing.  But a guy will spend the majority of his time trying to get the girl off. 
[00:22:00]  Not to his detriment, because the whole process feels pretty goddamn good.  But you are working toward a goal.  You are working towards a little goal there.  And you really got to work at it to get her to get off while you just sit there and kind of go,  Oh, Jesus.  Would you do this already?  There was one time I was in high school, and I was fooling around with some chick. 
[00:22:30]  And, boy, did she smell.  She was really bad.  Yeah.  And she wanted me to go.  That's a lot of work.  Dude, she wanted me to, like, you know, go down on her.  And I didn't want to because it was just terrible.  So we ended up, you know, I just wanted to kind of speed through the process.  So I finish.  She's not done.  And she's asking me to go and finish her down.  And I was just like, I was like, no.  And then what I ended up doing was just fingering her as I watched television for about 20 minutes.  I wasn't even paying attention. 
[00:23:00]  I was just like, she was on, like, a 90-degree angle.  I was just, like, poking her, just watching.  Did it work?  I guess.  Did she actually get off with you with your complete lack of interest?  Dude, what do you want me to do?  It was so bad.  It was, like, to the point, it's like, how do you not?  Realize that that's going on.  Like, how do you not realize that?  Was it on your finger for, like, days?  Oh, my God, dude.  Where you'd scratch.  You're going to scratch your nose and you're, oh, shit.  It was bad.  It was really bad.  It just lasts a while.  It lingers longer. 
[00:23:30]  You know, this comes up a lot on the show, like, you know, what it should be like, I guess, down there.  And it's just like, I just don't understand how some girls don't know that that's happening.  There are many different flavors and fragrances.  Yeah, but, I mean, when it's, you know, like a whitefish salad, you know what I'm saying?  Like, it really shouldn't be like that.  It's so hard to say that that's what, you know, it's like.  But, dude, that's what it's like.  Yeah.  And there's no reason for it.  And I know there are lots of girls that do not at all like going down on guys because guys give other guys a bad name by not washing, not washing appropriately the undercarriage. 
[00:24:00]  You know, they think a quick jack on the dick with a little soap in your hand is washing.  You've got to get the undercarriage.  You've got to go taint.  And it's not only that.  It's the hairs and stuff, too.  Yeah, yeah.  You've got to just get rid of it all.  You've got to be groomed.  Well-groomed.  I mean, that's what the hairs there, that's what it's for in Caveman Day is it would, like, retain, you know.  Pheromones?  Yeah, the smells and the pheromones.  So, you know, they knew where to go for things. 
[00:24:30]  I think it was protection, too, so you don't, like, you don't get stuff in there.  You know, so stuff didn't crawl in there.  It was almost like a Venus flytrap when it's closed, you know.  Well, in the oldie days, I heard a best of on the way home one day, or driving around wherever the fuck I was, and we were talking about that very thing, like, cave women sitting on rocks and things, because they didn't have clothes, perhaps.  Oh, right, yeah.  And, like, they would just sit down on things with their bare vag just on a dirty rock. 
[00:25:00]  How, like, pleasurable could that be, feeling little granules of sand and dirt?  And maybe mites?  Well, they had little loincloths, right?  I don't know.  In the movies, they did.  I don't know.  I don't think we know as much about those things as we think we'd like to know.  Didn't they make little bare skin underpants?  Yeah, and the girls would cover their boobs with, like, one that went over the shoulder like a toga.  Yeah, like a tiger. 
[00:25:30]  Because they were modest about their tits back fucking, you know, almost a million years ago.  Like a tiger-skinned singlet.  Yeah, a singlet.  You know, Fred Flintstone or something.  And the guy would have a little loincloth on and run around.  You'd never see his schween.  Dude, you know, if you're a lady out there, you've got to know what's happening.  You've got to know what's happening.  You think they do?  Do you think they know, but there's nothing they could do about it?  Because I've heard of some medical conditions where, wow, girls just, they go to doctors and have no clue that there's a pungent fragrance. 
[00:26:00]  I just don't see how, I mean, as a guy, like, I know when my balls are stinking.  So as a girl, how do you not know when things aren't exactly as fresh as it can be?  And it's on the outside, like, you know, you're nuts and everything.  You would know.  But a girl, sometimes you don't know until that seal gets cracked.  And then, wow.  All that really takes is, like, sitting down in the bowl for four seconds.  And it would be pretty close to the proximity of your nostrils when you're sitting there. 
[00:26:30]  So, yeah, I think they probably know why they would then get, go out and engage in sex without really doing stuff.  I know there's a lot of stuff on the market.  I see some embarrassing commercials for ladies out there with feminine itch.  They never get right to the point and go, does your pussy stink, obviously.  But it's feminine itching, not feeling fresh.  A feminine, do they call it feminine odor? 
[00:27:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Feminine odor and moisture problems.  There's all kinds of shit going on down there.  And they got the Vagisil snatch rot.  Thank you, Kevin.  I haven't heard them call it snatch rot on television.  My ex in the shower, she kept some, like, feminine hygiene cream.  And I was just like, can we just put this?  There was nothing bad down there, trust me.  But it was just something I didn't feel like looking at while I was taking a shower. 
[00:27:30]  Like, you know, you'd sit there in the shower, or stand there in the shower, rather, and you're just looking at all your shitty shampoo and conditioner bullshit bottles.  And I'm staring, and I'm like, that's disgusting.  Like, just put it away.  Does it need to be out every single time in the bath?  Like, what if company comes over?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's something I don't like keeping anything embarrassing laying around, or even in the medicine cabinet.  You've got to have a secondary cabinet where you stash things that you don't want other people to see.  Because they're going to rifle through your shit. 
[00:28:00]  And I have, you know, I've been known to have guests over my house.  I've been known to have guests over my house.  And I don't know.  I don't know if they're rifling through my stuff.  Because sometimes I'm not even there.  I'll leave for work.  And I'm not there.  I'll come home at whatever, 11.15, 11.30, depending on when we leave.  And be like, hey, how are you doing? 
[00:28:30]  You know, I assume they were sleeping.  But they could rifle through everything in my house.  So I've got to make sure there's nothing really embarrassing laying around.  A vibrating butt plug.  Things like that.  Well, that goes in the gun closet.  Yeah, you've got to put all the embarrassing sexual stuff in the magnetically sealed gun closet.  Imagine you break into Ant's gun closet and it's handguns and male real dolls.  Like those tranny real dolls. 
[00:29:00]  Gimp suits.  No, I did get jammed up once years ago with the ex-wife.  Because I took home one of those pocket pussies.  You know, those things that just, they look like a big fucking worm.  And the front just has a pussy.  It's so minimalist.  It does not resemble a woman in any way, shape, or form.  But they try to put like a little pussy on the front of it.  No, I got, actually, I have a, I think I know where you go with this.  Go finish up.  Yeah.  Because I think I know where you go.  I left it on the living room coffee table. 
[00:29:30]  Why was it in the living room?  On the coffee table?  Because I didn't use it.  But then she, she called up and ratted me out to Opie that I had used it and left it lying on the table.  And I hadn't used it.  But it's embarrassing.  You know, because we get access to a lot of that stuff.  Sure.  We got some stuff where, I swear, if I was the younger Anthony, I would be taking that shit home and fucking it every night. 
[00:30:00]  Dude, I've, I've.  The rubber ass that was in here.  Sure.  I looked at it thinking like, years ago, that would have been, like when you're just jerking off to fucking Sears catalog, that would have been the best thing ever.  Why not?  It's a new toy to play with.  Yes.  Well, because I, I went to, uh, I went to Austin a few months back.  And, uh, in Austin, there's a little company called Fleshlight.  Oh, the Fleshlight.  Yeah.  And, uh, we had a little tour of the factory where they make the Fleshlights.  How'd you get a tour? 
[00:30:30]  Uh, it was a whole long story.  But, uh, so as, you know, things are wrapping up, you know, the guys who had been showing us around said, well, all right, you guys want your own Fleshlights.  And so we're just like, you know, okay, sure.  What am I going to say?  Oh, no, that's okay.  Okay, so they give us these Fleshlights, and if you haven't seen them out there, it's basically just, it looks like a gigantic flashlight, hence Fleshlight, and the top screws off, and it's a pussy inside.  Oh, look at that.  Yeah, Mars just pulled it up.  Wow, that is, uh, yeah, it's a pussy in the top of a flashlight. 
[00:31:00]  Yeah, it's pretty cool.  How do you clean it?  Uh, that, that pussy mechanism comes out.  Oh, it does, for easy cleaning in any dishwasher.  Well, that's cool, because there's different, there's different Pussies.  Wow.  Yeah, you can get, like, extra tight, there's ones with, like, little nubs inside, it's pretty cool.  Oh, big ugly lips.  Actually, I think they do have different vagina styles.  Anyway.  Well, I give a pocket pussy a clitoris.  It just seems silly to me.  But, uh, I was just moving recently, and, uh, I was having some help, and, uh, and so the person that was helping me goes, uh, what's this? 
[00:31:30]  And I was just like, there was no way to, to get around it, and I was just like, oh, that's my flashlight.  And I just unscrewed the top, and I was like, see, it's a pussy.  Look, a pussy.  You just fessed right up with it.  Yeah, and then, like, the top was kind of sticky, because it was just kind of sitting around for a while.  Yeah.  So I was like, yeah, I should probably clean this.  And now, I'm standing there in my bathroom, and it's like my check, and I'm just, like, cleaning the top of my, my, my flashlight, which I probably haven't, I obviously used and didn't clean. 
[00:32:00]  Oh, because you did use it.  Probably.  Oh, I thought, probably.  How do you forget you used a flashlight?  I don't know.  Well, I know I used it.  I just don't remember if I cleaned it from the last time.  But the grossest thing about it, I thought you meant it was just sticky, like, from fucking around with it.  No, the top was.  From fingering it while you were watching television.  Because it's weird.  It's like this weird latex-y material.  It is very comfy.  But it's not latex.  It's strange.  Yeah.  Fleshlight, actually, it's pretty cool.  The most disgusting thing about it, though, is, uh, you know, there's got to be a collection area.  Oh, oh. 
[00:32:30]  A fucking reservoir.  Yeah, so, so that's on the opposite end.  And so, you know, uh, it's, it's, it screws off.  And, like, you always really felt like a real big jizz bucket, uh, after you had finished masturbating with your fake vagina fleshlight to unscrew the little cum cap and then clean it up.  You're just like, what am I doing?  You always just feel like a dirt bag.  You have to do anything after coming.  Even tissuing off, you just feel like a fucking dirt bag.  You're sitting there over the kitchen sink like you're nude, cleaning your, this fake vagina, just going, what happened to me? 
[00:33:00]  There's drippings going on your foot.  Yeah.  What happened to my life?  So much, you squeeze and tug, you can't get it all out.  Like, why did I think, because at some point in time, probably about seven minutes ago, this was a great idea.  It's the best thing you could do.  Wait, I'm going to stick my dick in a fucking, in a fleshlight and then fast forward 10 minutes and you're just like, oh my God, what happened to me?  Yeah.  Uh, earlier we were talking about women and their, um, their aromas, their fragrances, their, their smells down there. 
[00:33:30]  Uh, and I have been criticized by some listeners for not taking enough phone calls.  So, why don't we go to the phones?  My God.  I hate having to go to Lady Trucker, but she says women definitely know when they're dirty.  Uh, hi, Lady Trucker.  Good morning, fellas.  Yes, we, uh, usually know if there's something going on because our panties will stay wet.  Will stay wet?  Yeah, for no, you know, no apparent reason. 
[00:34:00]  And then, you get a yeast infection when you wipe, you'll get the, uh, white stuff.  You do?  Yeah, you, well, you're, you're big and fat and you drive a truck, so you're sitting on your pussy all day, rocking back and forth in those big track, the trail of seats.  Bongo!  Tell them large birds sit here.  Bongo!  Bongo!  Double clutching.  Her pussy's just like scraping together from double clutching.  How many gears you got in that thing? 
[00:34:30]  Bongo!  Ugh!  That must just really waft up into your face, huh?  Uh, yeah, I can sometimes.  Yeah.  How often do you shower?  I, usually I get a chance to do it every other day.  Every other day?  What, do you go to those truck stops with the shower and fucking stink that up?  Yes, I do.  We, uh, when we buy 50 gallons of fuel, we get a free shower.  Oh, that's good.  What, do you use a little fuel?  A little diesel?  Wash off a little diesel? 
[00:35:00]  Gets rid of the yeast?  No.  That might help.  That's industrial strength.  All right, so women know they're dirty.  Well, great.  Thank you, uh, thank you, Lady Trucker, for, uh, uh, filling us in on that one.  For having a stinky, disgusting pussy.  Yeah, a stinky pussy to tell us about.  Let's go to, uh, Steve.  Steve, hello.  Steve from Long Island.  My vagina smells very bad.  Yes.  What is this smell you're talking about?  I've never seen or smelled one.  Hi, Steve. 
[00:35:30]  Hello, how are you?  Um, basically, yeah, some women may know that their vagina smells, but they decide to do  nothing about it.  For example, they piss.  They don't wipe properly.  Number two, they have sex.  They don't wipe properly.  And then you get fucking rotting pussy flakes everywhere.  Pussy flakes?  Rotting pussy flakes.  Pussy flakes.  I think Kellogg's puts those out.  Is it Kellogg's or Post cereal?  It's very high sodium.  Yeah, yeah, I don't eat that anymore.  That's me.  I'm disgusting.  I'm Steve.  I don't like pussy. 
[00:36:00]  Yeah.  All right.  Thanks, thanks, Steve.  Goodbye.  All right.  He's bringing up the point that maybe girls, uh, not all girls are very hygienic when it  comes to, uh, taking a leak.  Again, we got shit hanging on the outside, so clean up is a breeze with us.  Clean up's a breeze.  You could go in after the fact.  All you need is a little warm water on a washcloth.  You give it the old up and down, round and round.  Just a baby wipe.  And you're back in bed.  Yeah.  You're all good.  And you're all, you're all, uh, you're all good.  Um, I, of course, have been known to partake in sexual intercourse during a woman's time, 
[00:36:30]  uh, which disgusts James Norton, uh, more so than missing a murderer on somebody's, uh,  uh, bio.  But, uh, uh, I've been known to do that.  And clean up after that is really fun because you take the washcloth and it, it just looks  like you were, you were putting, you were putting a compress on a sucking chest wound  when I pull it away.  It, uh, it takes a few.  Hey, look at that. 
[00:37:00]  It's Colin Quinn and Jim Florentine.  What's happening, guys?  Hi, gentlemen.  Sit down.  We were just talking about women and their hygiene.  Why can't we sit in Obie's chair?  Uh, because Daniel is sitting there.  Why can't we sit in Obie's chair?  You want to touch the buttons?  You want to sit there?  Like, I want to play with the buttons.  Going into the Oval Office and sitting in the president's seat.  Is that what you want to do?  It is weird, but yeah, I'll be not sitting in that chair.  Young Daniel is there to, uh, to win the boys.  It's weird not having a guy, it's weird not having a guy sniveling next to me and picking 
[00:37:30]  his nose with his napkin, like Jim Norton.  Jim Norton twitching.  Yeah.  Maybe, maybe Colin can help.  And going, and going, and then suddenly sucking up some kind of.  Oh, poor Jimmy.  We love the little guy.  I don't like the fact that he's in LA actually thinking in some little secret part of his  head that, hey, you know what?  I'm making it. </pre>
