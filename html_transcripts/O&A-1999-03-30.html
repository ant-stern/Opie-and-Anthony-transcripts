<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a listener congratulating her husband on their 14th anniversary and inducting him into the “Tuesday Hummer Club,” prompting a recurring Hummer-themed jingle.  This was immediately followed by a commercial for the Vermont Teddy Bear Company, highlighting their varied bears and "bear counselor" service.  Significant technical difficulties, particularly with the hosts' malfunctioning headphones, plagued the entire broadcast, causing frequent interruptions and exasperated reactions from Opie and Anthony.

Following the Vermont Teddy Bear ad, the hosts discussed Men's Hair Now, a hair replacement company, sharing an enthusiastic anecdote about a client with impressive results.  Then, in-studio guests Ed and Ross from Collective Soul arrived, although their appearance was delayed due to a scheduling misunderstanding.  The hosts praised the band's down-to-earth nature.

A substantial portion of the show was dedicated to phone calls, initially from someone claiming to be New York Jets player Wayne Chrebet.  The hosts were surprised, given perceived past tension, referencing a previous broadcast where Opie commented on Chrebet falling during a game.  Their conversation covered the Jets' season, the Denver Broncos, and – using offensive language – Denver fans.  The caller expressed displeasure about the fall comment.  Later, it was revealed the caller was an imposter, and the real Wayne Chrebet called in to clarify the situation, leading to a discussion about the imposter's motives.

Other segments included listener feedback, such as a caller who made a sign for a wrestling event; a discussion about the conclusion of March Madness (with Opie claiming a successful prediction); the hosts' declared support for the New York Islanders; complaints about tax season; and a discussion of *The Sopranos*, sparking an anecdote from Opie about his mother's involvement in numbers running in 1940s Harlem and a subsequent discussion about the portrayal of Italian-Americans in media and political correctness.  A caller also pitched a politically correct World War II movie idea.  A short-lived Godfather trivia segment was also included.

The broadcast further featured a listener-submitted song about the “Tuesday Night Hummer Club” with sexually suggestive lyrics; discussion regarding rumors of a potential move to K-Rock radio station and legal concerns about their website content, specifically differentiating indecency from obscenity; promotion of a contest featuring a naked model and a Priceline.com sponsored prize; a call from a Star Trek fan club member discussing club activities and a William Shatner cover of “Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds” (which was played on air); and continued promotion of the Vermont Teddy Bear Company for Easter.  The show’s overall tone was significantly impacted by the persistent technical issues.  A brief mention was made of a past April Fool's Day prank that resulted in their firing from a previous job in Boston.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  1027 WNEW, The Rock of New York, Two for Tuesday, Nirvana, about a girl from the Unplugged CD, and all apologies too.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hello.  Wow, what a day for a Hummer.  My God, huh?  Ah, my headphones are crapping out.  So did mine.  Really?  Yeah, what's up with that?  Hello.  Well, they're setting up for Collective Soul.  They're stopping by for a little visit today.  Can't wait to see those guys.  We've been following those guys for three radio stations now. 
[00:00:30]  It's pretty weird.  Yeah, looking forward to hearing them.  All right.  Well, you want to start with some instant feedback?  What do we got?  Gene from College Point, very excited that today is Hummer Tuesday.  My husband Charlie and I are married 14 years today, and we are both longtime fans of WNEW and new fans of Opie and Anthony.  I was wondering if you could let him know that my anniversary present to him is to induct him into the Tuesday Hummer Club.  Oh, my headphones crapped out again. 
[00:01:00]  You too?  Now they're back.  Do they crap out there, though?  Yeah, they are.  Something's weird.  They're plugging in stuff outside the studio, and I think that's screwing us up a little bit.  Oh, I hate that.  Where was I?  Present, present.  Oh, yeah.  Let him know that my anniversary present to him is to induct him into the Tuesday Hummer Club tonight.  Nobody deserves it more than he does.  Thanks, and keep up the good work.  Charlie, you got a present tonight, brother.  Rush home.  Man, that's something.  Well, we've got to get this out of the way right away. 
[00:01:30]  We haven't played this one in a couple weeks.  What do you got?  Well, just to get everyone in the mood for today.  It's Hummer time, Hummer time, Hummer time, Hummer time, Hummer time, Hummer time, Hummer time, Hummer time, Hummer time, Hummer time, Hummer time, Hummer time, Hummer time.  Hummer time, Hummer time. 
[00:02:00]  Fair to swallow.  It's okay.  Watch those deep bits cause the pain.  Hey, don't worry.  Now to taste it, Hummer time.  There you go.  Oh, man, it crept out again.  Yeah, mine are doing the same thing. 
[00:02:30]  Really?  Yeah.  We can't do a radio show this way.  I hear it going in and out.  To you at home, it doesn't make sense because you're hearing our voices, but...  Is it back now?  Oh, no, it's out again.  No, it's out.  Hello?  Ah!  That's...  I don't know if...  This is going to be very annoying.  If it has anything to do with your connection.  You think?  I don't know.  All right, let me talk.  No, see, I didn't do anything there.  Yeah, there's something else happening.  All right, here we go, engineer.  Here's Pete.  He's got to do a job here.  What seems to be the problem? 
[00:03:00]  Ah!  Yeah.  It's crapping out on us, Pete.  Will that work?  What do you hear?  I hear our voices better in our headphones.  But we also heard it good before, and then it would crap out.  Well, let's see if this works.  Okay.  Now I'm so distracted.  What were we going to talk about?  Yeah, I know.  All right.  Well, we've got to congratulate the University of Connecticut.  Wow!  March Madness is finally over.  So they won.  They won, yes.  It was a great game last night. 
[00:03:30]  I was really paying attention, close attention to it, and I seem to have missed that.  Well, I was hoping you were going to give me some credit today, Anthony.  I gave you some credit.  Go ahead, LB.  Well, when the tournament started, what did I tell you?  You said...  That Connecticut would play Duke in the finals.  Yes, you did.  But I did say that Duke would win.  That you did.  But that's pretty damn close.  Well, I don't know.  Is it close?  How many teams are in?  64.  64? 
[00:04:00]  To pick the final game, that's not too shabby.  I was a little tired of March Madness, to be quite honest with you.  Really?  Yeah.  Well, every commercial's got to, you know, McDonald's March Madness.  You know, everyone hops on the bandwagon.  I don't think...  I mean, obviously, it's very popular.  But I think there's a lot of people that don't know or care what it is.  I don't know.  I think more people were following March Madness than the stupid NBA, obviously, you know?  You think so?  Really?  All right. 
[00:04:30]  Yeah, March Madness is huge, eh?  That's just not a Hoops fan.  That's okay.  I am not.  I'm sorry.  And we're hearing from all the Ranger fans today.  Shut up.  Everyone knows we're Islander fans.  You're an Islander fan, too, right?  It's very hard to say yes, but yes.  Yeah.  Just remember, in 1999, Opie and Anthony admitted they were Islander fans on the radio.  Yeah.  So in ten years, when the Islanders are good again, we could say that we didn't jump on  the bandwagon.  Right.  Ten years.  It could take a while.  I know.  But the Rangers swept the season series, so... 
[00:05:00]  Yeah.  All right.  Woo!  Now, yeah, we got to regroup from our headphone debacle.  The headphones are driving us nuts.  It doesn't sound the same in the phones.  I think your volume, maybe.  I had to turn mine down a little.  I don't know.  All right.  Sorry, guys.  We'll try to figure this out next.  Honestly, I think there's a problem with this microphone.  With the mic?  Yeah, it's not picking up.  I don't know. 
[00:05:30]  We'll have Pete take a look when we take a break here, okay?  All right.  Two for Tuesday continues.  Judas Priest on the way.  If you want to hear something, 212-757-1027.  You can send the faxes in, 212-957-WNEW.  And we have the instant feedback for you as well.  Just go to the WNEW website, click on our pictures, and this is the button that has to  be down.  Let me see.  This button right here.  What?  No, no.  Now it's cutting out.  Damn it. 
[00:06:00]  All right.  Oh, it's crapping out again.  All right.  Let's...  Hold on.  Every time I talk, my headphones crap out.  That's what is going on here.  1027-WNEW, the rock of New York.  It's Opie and Anthony.  We're blowing out some of the Tuesday Hummer songs because we've got some technical problems  in the studio here.  Your headphones working out?  Is this working?  No.  No.  It's not, right?  Not working.  Oh, this is so annoying.  It cuts out.  It gates out, it sounds like. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah, when we start talking, it flips out and then comes back on.  See, to the listener, they're just hearing our voices and they think there's no problem  here, but I don't even think we could get phone calls on the air.  Let's see.  We won't hear them.  Hi.  Ah.  Hi, NAW.  Hi.  No, we can't do phones yet.  Sorry.  Really can't do a radio show yet.  What happened between yesterday and today?  I don't know.  That did this?  I got to take my headphones off.  Yeah, we can't do headphones.  I'm going to throw them through a window. 
[00:07:00]  Why don't you press the button with the processing?  What do you mean?  This?  Yeah.  That work?  Like that?  That other one?  Yeah.  Yeah, see?  At least there you can, you know, hear stuff.  All right, let's see if we can take the phone calls now.  Hi, NAW.  Hello?  Yeah, what's up?  Hey, I was just calling to see if you saw my Tory sign yesterday at Ross.  Uh, where were you seated?  I was about 15 rows up from the folding chairs.  Oh, no, we didn't see it.  Ah.  What did it say?  Tory, show us your balloon nut. 
[00:07:30]  That's pretty good.  I sent you a feedback yesterday.  You didn't get it?  No, we read it on the air.  Uh-huh.  So you definitely went through with it and did it, huh?  Yeah, I have the sign here.  Very cool.  We're talking about wrestling last night.  Yeah.  At the Continental Arena.  Raw is war.  Hmm.  And there you have it.  No, we didn't see that one.  There's a lot of other funny signs, but not that one.  The best sign on TV last night was, uh, is my sign on TV.  That's what the guy's sign said. 
[00:08:00]  So, all right, man.  All right, thanks a lot.  Yeah, we got some technical problems in the studio, so we're a little distracted.  Yeah, all right.  All right, brother.  Thanks.  Bye.  Damn.  All right, well, they're trying to figure it out.  These phones like this.  Ugh.  All right.  Are we ever going to get through the show?  I don't know.  This is odd.  It's very distracting.  Like, I definitely need this button now, but then the headphones cut out.  Ugh.  I just heard delay coming through.  It's a mess.  It's a mess in here. 
[00:08:30]  What happened?  Did somebody do something from yesterday till today?  What was done?  Every other word is cutting out.  I know.  What was done in here?  No big deal.  It's not a big deal to have the equipment working when we're on the air.  But something changed from yesterday, right?  Yeah.  Till today.  Right.  I don't know what it was.  See, we sound like a-holes because to the listener, it sounds fine. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah.  They don't get what the problem is.  It doesn't sound fine because we're talking kind of weird.  Yeah.  And we stop talking when it clips out in our ears.  Mm-hmm.  All right, it's not clipping now.  No, this may be it.  We may be back in business here, Anthony.  All right.  Okay.  I hope so.  Jesus.  The Rock of New York, 1027 WNAW, two for Tuesday with Ozzy Osbourne, shot in the dark and crazy train.  You're hanging with Opie and Anthony. 
[00:09:30]  Hey.  If we sound annoyed, we are.  All right.  I just got to remember to keep our mic volume down, Anthony.  You never had to do that before.  No.  See, if it's up here, it's going to crap out on us.  Yes.  But if it's down here, we'll be okay.  Well, now I've got to turn my headphones off.  Yeah.  All right.  Ah.  Okay, we're good.  Yes.  Let's roll.  Okay.  All right.  Alan from Long Island on the instant feedback.  Well, guys, I know it's Tuesday, but can I give a big F you to the IRS? 
[00:10:00]  And by the way, any day is a good day to say F you to the IRS.  Did my taxes last night, and boy, is Uncle Sam bending me over, and without a Hummer.  I hope they have payment plans.  Otherwise, you can send me a greeting card and address it to Sing Sing Prison.  Oh.  Take care, guys.  Oh.  Don't get fired.  New York needs you guys.  Alan.  Yeah.  Tax time.  Well, good luck to you, people.  Good luck to you.  I was dealing with that a little bit today. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah?  Benny taking care of me.  We love Benny.  Yeah.  Good guy.  I hope he can, you know, save me some of my hard-earned money.  Well, they do take a lot of tax out throughout the year, and then you find at the end of the  year you have to pay above and beyond that.  And no one questions this?  No.  No one questions it, Opie.  I mean, you look at your paycheck every two weeks, and you go, wow, they are taking a lot  of money out.  And then you're like, all right, at least I'll get some money back at the end of the year.  Wrong.  And you do your taxes and go, wow, I still owe a couple thousand? 
[00:11:00]  You owe.  How does that work?  Isn't that great?  Then the money you get to keep, whatever you buy, gets taxed.  It's like, wait a minute.  Wasn't I taxed on that already?  Yeah.  Like, I paid my tax.  You were kind enough, out of the kindness of your heart, to let me keep some of this money.  Thank you.  So now when I go to spend it, I have to pay a sales tax.  Yes.  Well, that doesn't seem very fair, does it?  No, not at all.  What's the story with that? 
[00:11:30]  Okay, well, I'll put it in maybe some stocks or the bank account, whatever, and try to  make some interest on it.  Sure.  That way, maybe I could gain back some of the money they took in taxes.  Right.  Okay, look, I made some money with my money.  Oh, they tax it.  And they tax it a lot because that's special money.  Yeah.  I don't understand it.  You can't win.  You are penalized for achieving or trying to achieve the American dream.  Yeah.  Supposedly, we're making okay money now. 
[00:12:00]  Nothing great.  But I don't know where the money is that I'm supposedly making.  I still don't have a bank account, and I owe money this year again.  The bank is, the dollar bill's rolled up in my pocket.  Far cabbage.  But they just keep taxing you.  Yeah.  Oh.  And no one questions it.  We just go along, and we'll pay it.  A few people question it in Montana with guns holed up in a house somewhere, you know? 
[00:12:30]  Yeah.  They usually...  It's extortion.  Yeah.  You're paying protection money to the government.  Where's the Soprano dude?  We could use his help.  Tony Soprano.  God, I love that show.  Oh.  I'm really ticked off that I didn't jump on board the Soprano show.  They're going to rerun all the episodes on HBO?  Starting when?  Because I've got to see it from the beginning now.  Yeah.  We have it written down somewhere.  All right.  But yeah, yeah.  You've got to see the whole thing.  The season finale's coming up.  And boy, it's a great show.  And some of these Italian-American groups are all pissed off that it's portraying Italians 
[00:13:00]  as gangsters in a bad light.  How come you can't portray a certain group as having an element in it that is bad?  You're not saying everyone is.  Like when I watch The Sopranos, I'm not like, oh boy, every Italian is in the mob.  But there were some Italians in the mob.  Yeah.  Just the way it happened.  They pretty much started it.  Yeah, you know?  Coming up, what are you going to do?  That's just the way it was.  So if you want to portray one of them on TV, on HBO, and The Sopranos, well, who's to get pissed off? 
[00:13:30]  Who cares?  It's part of history.  It's all part about getting politically correct in this country.  People don't like things, even if they're true.  Just cover them up.  Make like they never happened or don't happen.  And the world will be a wonderful place.  Let's not acknowledge our history.  Yeah.  Let's just start like history today.  That's what a lot of groups want.  They want that.  Right.  Don't acknowledge what happened years ago. 
[00:14:00]  My God.  No.  It's ridiculous, man.  Gets me.  Even my mom was in the mob.  Your mom?  My mom was in the mob.  Wait, hold on.  Dude, hold on.  I got to get to this story.  You're still there?  Yeah.  All right, hold on.  Your mom was in the mob?  Yeah.  Back in the 40s.  She was in the mob.  Explain.  She told me when we got together this weekend and told me how my grandfather was running numbers in Harlem back in the 40s. 
[00:14:30]  And she was a little kid.  And he used to go, Baba, Baba, come walk with Daddy.  Come walk with Daddy.  And as they were walking, he would put a big little roll of paper down her sock.  And then, you know, walk her somewhere.  I was laughing.  She's like a little girl, you know.  But I'm laughing.  Oh, you were in the mob?  She's like, don't scratch your ass.  I wasn't in the mob. 
[00:15:00]  She was a runner.  Yeah.  She was like running numbers with my grandfather.  Wow.  Was he heavy duty into it or was he just kind of a fringe player?  No, I think he was just a fringe player.  Yeah.  I think the bottom line is back in the 40s in Harlem, in a lot of parts of New York, if you were Italian, a good way to make money was to hook up.  You're not whacking people or anything.  But a good way to make a little money was to run some numbers or work for some of the boys. 
[00:15:30]  What are you going to do, go and work at a trade or something and make half the money?  Well, at least this makes sense now.  Because I was at your brother's wedding a year and a half ago about now, when Joe got married.  Yeah.  I swear to God, I thought I was going to get whacked in there.  Oh, stop it.  What do you mean stop it?  There's no one in the mob in my family.  It's like the scene from The First Godfather.  Who are you kidding?  There's no one in the mob in my family now.  We're talking back in the 40s.  Well, it sure felt like it. 
[00:16:00]  How did Joe afford that wedding?  I don't know.  He does things.  He does things.  You know, he works.  That was probably the best wedding I've ever been at.  Wasn't that a good wedding?  It was great.  Yeah.  No, none of my family.  I stood out like a sore thumb at that wedding, too.  My mother's telling me about my Uncle Jakey, who was a second story man.  I mean, she got a few in her.  She was spilling the beans.  I think I have to whack my mom. 
[00:16:30]  It was pretty interesting.  And what is a second story man, for the people that don't know him?  You know, you kind of, it's like a burglary guy.  And he would make the things fall off the trucks.  Yeah.  Yeah, he was into, like, hijacking and stuff.  Because then my mother's like, oh, yeah, we remember being kids, and the truck would pull up in front of the house, and we'd get TVs and clothes and dresses and all kinds of stuff off the truck. 
[00:17:00]  And she was very popular in the neighborhood because her father, my grandfather, would buy all the kids ice cream on the street.  The ice cream man would come, and he would set up all the kids.  It was only five cents back then.  Well, that's big money back then.  All right.  For all the kids.  I mean, forget about it.  Yeah.  Back in the old days.  Harlem of the 40s.  The more and more I hang out with you, the more and more I learn.  It's amazing.  That's right.  Keep learning.  Maybe someday I'll do you a favor.  All right. 
[00:17:30]  All right.  Hello.  Hey, how you doing?  What's up, buddy?  You guys are up and running again.  Yeah.  Sort of.  The mic is, the headphones are still crapping out, but no one wants to hear us complain, so we're going to try to move on here.  All right.  Well, I'm just sitting here sick.  I'm trying not to laugh too hard or else I'll start coughing, but I just want to say hey.  So, see you later.  This is your audience today.  Great.  Thanks.  All right.  Sick people complaining.  All right, buddy.  All right, man.  Bye.  I know what happened there.  The actual guy hung up, and right when you hit the button, that guy got through on the line. 
[00:18:00]  That's why we try to screen him a little bit.  Hi, N.E.W.  Hey, guys.  I got a great idea to deal with all your money.  What?  Let's make a World War II movie with no Germans and no Japanese.  Yeah.  That'll be the politically correct one.  We won't offend anybody.  We can make them like Martians or Planet of the Apes.  And then we talk it over.  We don't drop any big bombs or anything.  No, of course not.  We just hash it out by talking.  And then we save a whale and roll the credits.  I like it. 
[00:18:30]  I like it.  I like the way you think.  Yeah.  That's pretty much what is going on in this world these days.  You can't acknowledge things that actually happened in this world as being accurate.  The facts now are getting to it.  We're getting what they call revisionist history, Opie.  People like remembering things different from the way they actually were.  It's a sad thing.  I don't care.  I'm Italian.  And I know that back in especially the 40s and the 50s, Italians ran organized crime. 
[00:19:00]  In the big cities, they did.  That's just the way it was.  And if you make a movie about it, why not give the guy Italian names?  Because that's the way it was.  You're not going to give him an Irish name.  Well, there were some Irish mobs, too.  Not like the Italian mobs.  Not as fun.  Well, Opie, they were always drunk.  See, I'm being extreme here, folks.  Don't you get it?  Well, we'll get a letter for that.  Yeah, I'm sure.  Hi, N.E.W.  Yeah, hello.  I heard you guys talking about Italians, right? 
[00:19:30]  Yeah, Dan.  What's up?  Yeah, hi.  A while ago, when immigrants first came to America, if some guy was brought to jail,  four out of five chance it was an Italian.  Really?  Four out of five, man.  Where are you getting your facts from?  CrimeLibrary.com.  I love the Internet now.  You can just punch everything up.  I find stuff on Charles Manson, the Purple Gang, Jeffrey Dahmer, and the guy that they modeled  Dr. Hannibal from in The Sounds of the Lambs.  Yeah, Hannibal Lecter. 
[00:20:00]  Well, at least you're using the Internet for something useful.  I love the Internet.  You got sick of the porno, huh?  No, I still do that.  Of course you do.  W, W, W, dot.  No, I'm not going to reveal it.  All right, man.  We got to go.  Bye-bye.  Isn't that amazing, though?  A lot of people are learning a lot more things these days because it's right at your fingertips.  Yeah.  Hi, N.E.W.  Yeah.  Hi.  What's up?  Hey.  You guys want to do the Godfather trivia?  Why?  What do you got?  I got a lot of questions.  I'm sure I'm going to stump them.  Yeah.  All right.  How about one question? 
[00:20:30]  All right.  One question.  I'll make it an easy one.  All right.  When, you know, in the first, what do you want from part one, part two?  One.  One, yeah.  All right.  When Paulie gets killed, you remember the driver?  Paulie?  Yeah.  All right.  When he gets killed, when Clemence is out taking a leak?  Yeah.  What monument's in the background?  What monument is in the background?  Oh, is it the Robert Moses?  No, it's Statue of Liberty. 
[00:21:00]  I don't know.  What was the sound of it?  Like, I got a lot of detail-oriented questions.  Yeah, I don't like those.  All right.  Well, why?  Yeah, you got to be paying attention.  Yeah, that's right.  Even, I got older ones, too.  But, you know, I even wrote them down.  All right.  One more.  All right.  All right.  Yeah.  You want another background question?  No, we don't.  Background?  Who cares?  This is a good one, though.  All right.  Go ahead.  A background.  Dude, you can't curse.  Oh, sorry.  I didn't realize I was on the air.  What is it? 
[00:21:30]  Everything's on the air.  Oh, my God.  I called one other time and you screamed it.  You played it, like, 20 minutes before.  All right.  Listen.  Oh, sorry.  All right.  Give us your other godfather question without cursing.  All right.  Are we doing it for prizes, though?  Oh.  Goodbye.  There's your trivia.  Goodbye.  And the answer is hang up on you.  What took us so long?  We should hang up on you.  I know.  30 seconds ago.  Background questions.  All right.  We have Collective Soul coming in the studio.  When?  Like 5 o'clock or so?  They're playing the Bowery Ballroom. 
[00:22:00]  We'll get you warmed up.  The Rock of New York, 1027 WNEW, two for Tuesday.  Collective Soul Heavy off their Dosage CD and Where the River Flows.  Those guys playing the Bowery Ballroom tonight for a little visit.  Should be here by 5 o'clock.  I think we're going to try to talk them into playing.  Yeah.  They better play.  Well, they've been here three or four times now.  Now I think it's time for them to play a few songs for us.  Pick up your instruments.  I think we can play.  Hopefully make that happen.  Why is the boss guarding the door?  Yeah, look at that. 
[00:22:30]  He's leaning against it.  I think he wants to be on the radio today.  You want to come on?  I just feel it.  You don't need any more vagary on this show.  Oh, he was upset with us yesterday talking about how vague he is.  Like when we ask him about things, rumors in the paper you might have read,  and we ask for him to clear things up.  And he's a little upset.  I said he's very green-span-y.  Yeah.  Well, I always say no.  No, you don't.  Are we going to K-Rock?  No.  Okay.  We're being evasive. 
[00:23:00]  Well, that was in the paper.  You're being evasive.  That's what Opie said.  You're being evasive.  Why don't you tell me the truth?  I said no.  Well, it was reported in the paper yesterday.  We're going to K-Rock to do mornings.  I think that slot's taken.  Yeah, I think so.  And he's doing it.  There's somebody pulling in a lot of cake for the station.  I believe he does a good job at it, too.  Yeah.  Yeah, I think he's got a few listeners.  Man.  Jesus.  What is wrong with the radio reporters in this town?  That was Peter Goodman.  They're on dope or something.  Peter Goodman.  I think maybe years of Toupet glue. 
[00:23:30]  Well, you know what?  Peter Goodman started the whole rumor about a month ago.  Yeah, he starts it.  And now he's writing on it.  It's a comeback.  And then he reports about the rumor.  That's brilliant.  So when all these rumors don't come true, or most of them, I hope...  No, no, you can't say that because sometimes a rumor gets out there and it gets around enough  that the people who make the decisions actually go, man, that's a pretty good idea.  We should do that.  Oh, look at that.  Sometimes that happens.  But we're going to call Pete out on this one.  Yeah. 
[00:24:00]  When we finally settle the dust around here.  Yeah.  And then we're going to read all his columns on the air to show people how wrong he was.  He thought we were going homo-urban.  Well, then there's a rumor that we're going country.  That's making the internet these days.  Ouch.  I'll tell you true, true...  This is true, though.  Garth Brooks' manager called, Scott Herman, and said if we went country, that Garth would  come for a month for free and do a show.  Oh, who cares?  Garth.  Garth.  Is he still hitting baseballs? 
[00:24:30]  Apparently that's not working out.  Well, I know.  Obviously.  Ugh.  Why does he...  I got friends and...  Get out of here.  Yeah.  Why does he get a chance to make a baseball team and you and I, we don't?  Well, this is...  Is it because he's famous?  Justin, we're going country Spanish talk.  That's what we're doing.  It's talk about Spanish country music.  Yeah, we'll cover all our bases.  I think they do that in Los Angeles now.  So you can confirm we're not going to K-Rock to do mornings. 
[00:25:00]  We're staying right here.  Right.  We're not getting fired.  Correct.  Well, I don't know.  That's up to us.  It's a separate issue.  But everything we've done thus far will not get us fired, right?  Yeah.  Okay.  What about the all talk?  What are you doing now?  See?  That's what we mean by vague.  See?  He's very vague.  Right there.  Right there.  That's a little thing.  All right.  Yeah.  I don't mind if you go all talk.  So he's very vague about the talk issue.  We go all talk.  Okay.  Well, what else matters outside of you? 
[00:25:30]  See?  This is what we mean.  Remember the episodes of Kung Fu?  Remember Kung Fu?  Like all of a sudden when he was in the monastery thing, he would walk up to the head guy there  and ask him a question.  And the guy would go, no, grasshopper.  You will know when the time is right.  You will.  And I would turn around and go, look, just tell me.  Yeah.  You know, I need to go to this place and save somebody.  Sure.  So when do I make my move?  You will know when it is right. 
[00:26:00]  Tell me.  Take the mystery out of it.  Well, Gary did shave his head, so.  Yes.  No, it fell out.  That'll happen around here.  All right.  All right.  Okay.  Well, thanks for just clearing up so many things.  He also was talking to us about our website.  Yeah.  He was meeting with the lawyers today.  That's interesting.  Yeah.  And apparently there's a real difference between indecency and obscenity.  Indecency and obscenity. 
[00:26:30]  Now, what's bad?  Well, the difference basically is I understood it because it was a lot of lingo.  A little vague.  But basically it becomes obscene when it produces kind of a purine response.  When it stimulates.  Right.  It stimulates the.  Right.  Right.  But some people are stimulated by girls in bikinis.  And that can be in an ad in a JCP.  Some people are stimulated by bird watching.  Yeah.  Right.  Some people are getting stimulated just looking at the pictures of the jocks on the NAW website. 
[00:27:00]  Oh, so who's going to define that?  We can't find that person at this point.  And does the web fall under that jurisdiction?  Well, not yet.  Yeah.  But the courts are now beginning to look into that.  Oh, it's going to be a long, arduous battle.  Well, I think we will emerge victorious as perverts.  Yeah.  That seems to be.  You know what it is?  The web.  You can't control where everything's coming from.  I love these lawmakers. 
[00:27:30]  We're saying, no gambling.  No internet gambling.  How are you going to plug up the phone lines from an island off of Greece or something, you know?  It can't be done.  This is finally a medium that really they have a hard time controlling.  Well, the government will figure out something, though.  They always do.  They always do.  All right.  We'll see.  I don't know.  The biggest issue is taxes.  Yeah.  There's going to be commerce.  How are they going to get revenue?  Cash.  Right.  That's what they want. 
[00:28:00]  Governments want revenue.  Their money.  Right.  Because people are making money hand over fist on the net.  And they're not getting their piece.  So the higher ups, they have a problem with the website.  Or they're a little scared.  No.  Everybody's into it.  Yeah.  We have lots of people that volunteer to research this.  You know, we're getting about 50,000 hits a day right now from those pictures from Friday?  Wow.  They're just preemptive.  You know, they want to look at it and make sure, you know.  You waterproof your basement hoping it never floods.  But, you know, you want it there just in case.  Now, was that green spanny or what? 
[00:28:30]  What was that?  No, you did pretty well there.  I know the lawyers around here.  We don't want to get there.  They're taking care of us.  We don't want to get kicked off an eighth server.  No, I don't think that'll happen.  No.  Hopefully.  So if it's stimulating.  Well, there's some stimulating pictures on there.  What if it's repulsive?  Yeah, there's some repulsive stuff on there.  Yeah.  Well, that's the other thing.  I mean, some people find all sorts of things repulsive. 
[00:29:00]  And other people find them stimulating.  Right.  See, they're trying to fit everything into categories when people, in general, have different views on everything.  Right.  You can't have one guy saying this is acceptable and this isn't because the next guy thinks it's the other way around.  I don't know.  I'm for opening everything up.  Yeah.  I like everything.  Hey, did you talk to Priceline today?  Can we bust that out in the air?  I haven't heard from them, but as soon as we do, yeah, that'll be good.  All right.  It's not confirmed, but you know, we talked to Tara yesterday, hottest girl to ever pose naked on the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:29:30]  And she wanted a little class brought into this contest that we've started three months ago.  She was a little upset.  It was getting a little sleazy for her.  A little sleazy on Friday.  We understand that.  We told her that the four girls that came in, one of which will challenge her, that was a preliminary bout.  You know, that's in the back room at the stinky gym.  Yeah.  They have to work their way up to the big time.  Well, we're cleaning it up.  And the person that takes on Tara from those four girls that everyone's voting on, go to the semi-live studio cam in the Opie and Anthony section of the NEW website if you haven't cast your vote yet. 
[00:30:00]  The winner of that competition, when we pick the girl to take on Tara, will win a trip from Priceline.com.  How about that?  Not confirmed yet, but pretty close.  Yeah, we were talking to them.  So we're cleaning up this contest and making it worthwhile.  Isn't that fantastic?  Priceline, I told you, they're great.  I love them.  So that'll bring some more women out of the woodworks.  Yeah.  All right?  All right.  Well, thank you for clearing all that up, boss. 
[00:30:30]  Anytime.  What did he clear up?  I don't know.  I guess we're not going to KROQ and we're going to be dumped from an eighth server.  Well, great.  I'm going to get some jello for you now.  Okay.  I could use it for that.  You're getting a little slow there.  Oh, look at that.  He's taking a jab at you.  Ouch.  That hurts.  Go do some work.  The Rock of New York, 1027 WNAW, two for Tuesday.  Kiss calling Dr. Love in Detroit, Rock City.  Music sounds good today, man.  We're rocking.  Yeah. 
[00:31:00]  Sophie and Anthony, don't forget, coming up around 5 o'clock, we've got Collective Soul  for a little visit tonight.  They're playing the Bowery Ballroom.  And lots of instant feedback coming in.  We were talking about how politically correct the world's getting.  I think it's obvious to everyone by now.  Mm-hmm.  And how we want to pretty much forget about history and make believe it never happened.  Well, anytime you portray it on television or whatever medium you choose, people will  come out of the woodworks and yell and bitch that a certain ethnic group or nationality 
[00:31:30]  is being portrayed in a bad light.  Correct.  When in the meantime, that's the way history was.  So when an Italian is portrayed as a gangster on television.  Sopranos.  Sopranos, yeah.  It was getting all kinds of flack from Italian groups.  I love the show.  And you know something?  There were a few Italian people in the mob.  Oh, oh.  Did I say that?  Oh, I'll be woo.  Can you imagine if they made The Godfather in this day and age? 
[00:32:00]  Yeah.  It wouldn't be the same movie.  I know.  It would probably blow.  People get very upset.  But I think we touched a nerve because Larry from the island writes, watching a John Wayne  movie the other day on A&E and they censored the word Jap.  Huh.  Are you kidding?  They didn't bleep it.  Just deleted it.  You saw John Wayne's lips move and you could tell what he said, but no sound.  You censored the Duke?  They censored the Duke?  You can't censor the Duke.  Especially when he's saying Jap. 
[00:32:30]  My God.  Did he say Jerry?  Talking about the Germans?  Maybe Nip?  That's what they were called when we were fighting them.  That's what it was.  We weren't very friendly with each other.  No, they were the enemy.  No.  We weren't going over there and trading recipes.  No.  I think we were bombing each other.  Oh, people.  So, there's plenty of those type of examples, I'm sure.  If you got one, you could definitely get a hold of us.  Get a grip.  Well, we found the William Shatner song, Anthony. 
[00:33:00]  Really?  Yeah.  Good.  I like this.  Which one do you want to hear?  We got a couple of them.  We got Mr. Tambourine Man.  That's a favorite.  We have Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds.  I love Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds.  He is so dramatic in this.  He is such a...  He is hamming it up.  This was done when?  In the 70s?  Like very early 70s or maybe late 60s?  Yes.  Somewhere in the 70s.  Now, did he do this as a goof or were they serious when they were putting these songs out? 
[00:33:30]  From everything I've read and I've heard him talk about this, he was doing his interpretation of the music.  So, he was serious doing this.  He's not a singer.  He is an actor.  Right.  A thespian.  Yeah.  So, he was acting...  The song.  The song in lieu of singing it.  Okay.  So, it's Bill Shatner.  What an actor anyway.  And then when he acts a song, it...  Oh.  You bring tears to your eyes. 
[00:34:00]  This is top shelf stuff, Anthony.  Oh, my God.  Would you like to hear Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds by William Shatner?  I love this.  This is not Anthony.  This is an actual...  No, this is really William Shatner.  He did this.  Yeah, great music.  See him in the studio, you know?  Sounds like a Christmas song.  Yeah.  The intro?  Captain's Log.  Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds. 
[00:34:30]  Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds.  These studio musician chicks.  Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds.  He was probably at the mixing board making sure everything's okay.  Turn it down a bit.  Just turn it down a bit.  Here he comes.  Picture yourself in a boat on a river with tangerine trees and marmalade skies.  Somebody calls you.  You answer quite slowly. 
[00:35:00]  A girl with kaleidoscope eyes.  Oh, my God.  A cellophane flower.  See you.  Yellow and green.  Towering over your head.  For the girl with a sun in her eyes.  And she's gone.  Nice effect.  Wow. 
[00:35:30]  How did I do?  Did I hit that last note properly?  Yes, you did, Mr. Shatner.  I like the echo effect.  Instead of going off into space.  The final frontier.  All right, here he comes.  Follow her down.  To a bridge by a fountain.  Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies.  Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers that grow so incredibly high.  Newspaper taxis appear on the shore waiting to take you away. 
[00:36:00]  Climb in the back with your head in the clouds.  And you're gone.  Yeah.  Bill.  Oh, wow.  Does he kick ass or what?  Yeah.  And you're gone.  Gone.  All right, here he comes again.  Picture yourself.  Yes.  On a train station.  With plasticine porter. 
[00:36:30]  With looking glass ties.  Suddenly, someone is there at the turnstile.  You're a girl with kaleidoscope eyes.  Oh, is he great?  Lucy in the sky.  Lucy in the sky.  Lucy in the sky.  Oh, the big fade out here. 
[00:37:00]  Wow.  There he is.  Is that brilliant?  See, the last verse, he's not as, you know, just up on the whole thing, you know?  Incredibly high.  He's like, picture yourself.  Train.  Station.  Something happened in between.  I think the pot wore off.  They got him.  Maybe that was, you know.  Also, Spock singing, I have a hammer, or if I had a hammer. 
[00:37:30]  That's a good one.  I believe we got that.  Do we?  Yeah.  We could screw around with these songs today.  William Shatner.  God, that is just a brilliant interpretation, Bill.  You can't even come up with a better bit than that.  No.  And it's real.  God.  William Shatner should do another album, Metallica songs.  Ooh.  And maybe we could do that.  That could be cool.  The Rock of New York, 1027 WNW, two for Tuesday with Pink Floyd.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Got a guy on the line that, what is his name, Mike? 
[00:38:00]  He runs a Star Trek club, and he never heard that William Shatner song we just played in  a little while.  Really?  Mike.  Hey, Mike.  What's up?  You like that William Shatner song?  Guy, that was, I've been trying to find it just so I can, you know, play it over and  over and annoy everybody else that I know.  Is that the funniest thing?  That thing is hysterical.  Yeah, pretty funny.  Yeah, but you own, you run a William Shatner club?  No, no, no, no, no.  A Star Trek fan club. 
[00:38:30]  All right, Star Trek fan club, and you don't have a copy of that?  Well, I, you know how much these dealers are asking for something like that?  That's a, dealers.  But you can find that pretty much anywhere on the internet.  It's a, what was it, part of Golden Throats or something like that?  Yeah.  It's an album that's available.  They just had a convention in the city this past week, and it wasn't there.  Oh, you went?  Oh, yeah.  I do security at the conventions.  Do you get all dressed up?  Sometimes.  As a security officer?  Hold on a second, guys.  I don't know if he does security, but he dresses up like a...  Sorry about that. 
[00:39:00]  Do you dress up like the Enterprise security?  Oh, hell no.  We got our own uniforms.  Oh, Klingon.  No, not exactly.  We got our friends dressing up as Klingons.  We do our own uniforms.  I'm sure you guys are familiar with the Imperial Universe.  The ones where they play bad guys.  Oh, yes, of course.  Yeah, that's the way we dress up.  Ah.  We got our own uniforms.  Uniforms aren't standard.  We got leather uniforms.  Hey, can you pick up chicks at these conventions?  Oh, please.  Why would you want to do that? 
[00:39:30]  I don't know.  Well, can you pick up guys?  I mean, what do you mean?  Why would I want to do that?  Man, these are a bunch of biggest weirdos around.  I mean, hey, I may like the stuff, but some of these people are more far out than I am.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  What's the strangest thing you've seen at a Star Trek convention?  I'm sorry?  What is the strangest thing you've seen at a Star Trek convention?  Oh, man.  I don't know.  I've just seen so many different things.  Yeah.  People in costumes.  Let's put it this way.  Sometimes that much flesh should not be allowed to fit in so much leather. 
[00:40:00]  Really?  Yeah.  I've seen some of the fat girls that try to dress up like some of the chicks that Kirk has scored with.  Hold on, guys.  That guy, I'm at work.  I've got to answer a call.  All right.  We've got to let you fly then, man.  Okay.  We can't wait for your little call there.  Okay.  Bye.  That's all right.  W-N-E-W, New York, Infinity Broadcasting.  All right, Anthony, MapQuest.com.  No need to get lost ever again.  Ever again.  You're going to be going out somewhere? 
[00:40:30]  You have a destination you don't know how to get to?  Put it in MapQuest.com.  This really is a great idea.  I wish I came up with it.  I'd be a billionaire.  Well, you were too busy with pornography on the computer to think of something as useful as this.  You know, I've been doing the Internet thing for almost 10 years.  And if I would have spent more time trying to figure out a way to make money with the Internet instead of checking out all the porn sites, you're right.  Let's look back in time.  Here's the people at MapQuest at a little get-together in front of their computer. 
[00:41:00]  Guys, we can do something where people put the destination of the place they want to go in the computer and put in where they're leaving from.  And we will print out detailed directions to the destination with mileage and where you make your turns and a color map of the entire area so people will not get lost.  This is what the Internet is about.  And it's free, totally free.  Correct.  This will help people so they don't get lost. 
[00:41:30]  Now, that's what they were doing.  What were you doing?  And they made it work.  Yeah, what were you doing while they were coming up with that idea?  Well, both of us.  I know.  In front of the computer.  So pathetic.  Okay, download that JPEG.  Oh, look at the cans on her.  Is that beautiful?  Okay, MapQuest, helping people not get lost.  Just free service, directions, maps.  It's brilliant.  A brilliant idea.  I just want to know how they figure this out.  Well, it's called work. 
[00:42:00]  Yeah, but it's called being clever.  Like, do you think, like, one guy just went to every location and then they just pop it in there?  I mean, how do you figure it out?  All right, put this in.  I made a right, a left.  Right.  I don't think so.  Obviously.  But how do they figure that out?  Oh, Opie, it's done with satellites and mirrors.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Because if you haven't done this yet, just put the address of where you work and your home address.  Yeah.  And you'll be amazed.  It's your way home.  It's like, how do they know that's the way I go home? 
[00:42:30]  You might even find a quicker way home.  True.  TryMapQuest.com.  All right, I believe we'll be talking to Collective Soul next time we take a little break here, all right?  All right.  Stick around.  Those guys play in the Valerie Ballroom tonight.  Just give me a hard time.  You know it's your past life, man.  You know, I've got to give you a hard time now.  1027 WNAW, the rock of New York.  Two for Tuesday with Van Halen, Top Jimmy, and Jamie's crying.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hey.  And we've got a couple of the guys from Collective Soul in the studio.  I see.  We've got Ed and Ross. 
[00:43:00]  What's up, guys?  Hello, hello.  They've been hanging out in the lobby for the last 20 minutes because I thought the whole band was coming in.  And we realized we've got two out of the four.  That's not bad.  Well, we don't like each other.  So, you know, it's...  That's the way rumors get started.  What are the other two guys doing?  I hope beating each other up.  That's what they do.  Oh, man.  I don't know.  Probably sleeping.  We were just going over that.  We get shifts.  We get to sleep in shifts when you come to New York.  You know.  Why is that?  The record company works you hard.  True, huh? 
[00:43:30]  Still?  Yeah, there's all the kind of...  There's all kind of press you have to do and foreign press.  Really?  It's a good thing.  I was going to say that there's a lot of bands that would kill to be in your room.  Oh, no.  I'm over here whining.  Hey, if the headphones clip out on you, don't mind.  We have some equipment problems today.  Oh, I'm fine.  I just noticed they clipped out again on me.  Yeah.  Isn't this great?  You're still on the air.  You just won't hear it in the headphones.  Well, it's a professional radio station here.  At its best.  Exactly.  But you guys are from Stockbridge, Georgia. 
[00:44:00]  I remember that because I had an intro to you guys like, let me think, five years ago now, I think.  Yeah, right at the very end.  When you guys were first starting out, they played a restaurant on Long Island.  A restaurant.  The Jukebox Cafe.  It was like a restaurant.  And then we cleared the tables away.  In a corner.  And we played.  And then Collective Soul played.  And they were moshing and stuff.  And the owner of the club was just freaking out.  Because Bucky.  Yeah, because people were breaking stuff, man.  They didn't realize how cool Collective Soul was.  And nobody could see anybody because there was no stage. 
[00:44:30]  So we're like the same level as everybody else.  Yeah.  It's just like a crowd with music coming out of the middle.  We were actually looking up at the audience because I'm kind of short myself.  You guys have come a long way from then.  Oh, man.  We still do it in a heartbeat.  That's cool.  That's great.  And you had dinner with us and our listeners.  It was pretty wild back then.  But I remember your people.  They were yelling at me.  Don't forget to tell everyone they're from Stockbridge, Georgia.  Really?  Not Georgia.  Stockbridge, Georgia.  Who yelled at you from our side?  I don't know.  It was either like a record geek or one of the guys. 
[00:45:00]  It was one of your people.  Where the hell is Stockbridge, Georgia?  Because from that day.  It's south of Atlanta.  Right.  And I think.  I don't know why we kept saying Stockbridge.  I just.  I have no idea.  Well, actually, that's where we're from.  But it's just like.  That's where we're from.  It's just a suburb of Atlanta.  It's easy to say Atlanta.  Yeah.  You know, 15 minutes you're in Atlanta from where we live.  Is that anywhere near Buckhead?  Yes, it is.  Is it? 
[00:45:30]  Yes, it is.  We spent some time in Atlanta.  Really?  In Buckhead?  Well, we got.  Just to quickly explain.  We got fired from our last radio job.  And it was between Atlanta and New York.  Yeah.  And we chose New York over here.  We were going to go to Atlanta, so they flew us down there and showed us a good time and  stuff.  We had fun.  I know where they took you.  Where?  I know where they took you.  Uh-oh.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  We went there.  Oh, this is some of the Jita.  I know where you went.  We hit every strip club in Atlanta. 
[00:46:00]  Yeah.  That's a lot of them.  How long were you there?  A couple of weeks?  Yeah, really.  Seriously.  We were doing about four or five at night.  I mean, we just took the tour.  You know, the high-class ones, the cheesy ones, and everything.  Yeah, we noticed the different tastes in the bars down there.  Yeah.  You know, there's the real classy one where the girls look nice.  They're like, don't touch now.  Don't touch.  You know, they have an agent you have to hand the money to, you know.  He takes his percentage, gives it to the girl.  And then there's the ones that are just like, she just picked up my beer bottle with no 
[00:46:30]  hands.  You know?  I like those places.  I like those places best.  Strip clubs and waffle houses in Atlanta.  That's it.  On every corner.  Now, do you guys ever run into Elton John when you're in Atlanta?  Yeah, actually.  We, he did a, it's like an acoustic performance at the Fox Theater there and invited us, and  we went there and saw that, which was great.  You know, just him and the piano.  And he keeps in touch with us, and we keep in touch with him.  He's very, very, he's very good to this band. 
[00:47:00]  Keep in touch?  Yeah.  I mean, we'll call.  Oh, I get it, Opie.  He's, he's making a joke.  I'm sorry.  Like he touches you.  I'm sorry.  Oh, I just had to, oh, come on.  Oh, let's all be shocked.  Oh, my God.  We know he's a good guy.  Where's the cough button?  Yeah.  Ed wants out already.  I get it.  Ross doesn't say much over there.  He's been very, very supportive of our band, and we really appreciate everything he's done  for us.  Pretty good music scene in Atlanta these days.  It's great.  Great, great urban scene.  I mean, it's a, it's, the cool thing about Atlanta, it's very diverse. 
[00:47:30]  And that's, you know, it really had no history.  It's making its own history right now, which is kind of cool.  So, um, so it's, it's, it's, like I said, very diverse, great urban scene, great hip  hop, you know, and then you guys are doing Freak Nick.  Yeah.  You know, people got to release energies, you know, I do the same thing, just somewhere  else.  Um, um, but, um, you know, you got the Black Crows, you got R.E.M., then the Go Girls. 
[00:48:00]  It's, it's just a really cool, I think it's a great scene.  Now, what do you think of the music scene in general, as far as, as far as, uh, rock goes?  I think it's great.  I think it's, um, you know, people always talk about that it's, it's dead or whatever.  I, I don't think it is.  I think things go in cycle.  I think, you know, to some people, to the mass majority, it may not be the most exciting  form of music right now, but it's not going anywhere.  It's going to be here.  And, you know, it's, I remember people talking about it in the eighties and all, all of a  sudden here comes Guns N' Roses, you know, and they talked about it in the nineties and 
[00:48:30]  all of a sudden here comes Nirvana.  So, you know, it's, it's, it just goes in cycles and it's, it will always be the  cornerstone of pop music to me.  So, and, and, and, you know, just make branch out and be a little, get a little bit more  different in different areas, but it's, it's not going anywhere.  I hope anyway, our, our livelihood depends on you.  You guys are doing just fine.  Just fine.  You want to play a couple of songs for us?  Rumor has it you may, uh, oh my goodness.  That's what we're waiting on is my acoustic.  I don't, are you? 
[00:49:00]  I'm hoping to.  You can just use mine and I'll sing.  No.  No.  No.  You go ahead.  I'll watch.  I'll listen.  We could just have Ed play by himself.  Oh, no boy.  With him.  Well, what do you want to do?  Where is that call button?  What is going on?  We could take a break and see what happens.  How's that?  Mm-hmm.  All right.  It's your call.  All right, Anthony, the Vermont Teddy Bear Company.  Easter is this Sunday.  Do something different this year and send your loved ones an Easter bunny or a bear gram from the  Vermont Teddy Bear Company.  It's a great way to send a surprise that's truly personal and fun, Ant. 
[00:49:30]  What are you going to do?  Send the same little chocolate Easter bunny for the sweetie to bite the head off of?  You could send a Vermont Teddy Bear.  Or those peeps.  Beeps.  Peeps.  I like the peeps, but.  I do like peeps, man.  But you got to do something different than the peeps.  Maybe you get a Vermont Teddy Bear and a peep.  Yeah.  You know?  I hooked up with some peeps this weekend.  My sister had them over the house.  First peeps of the year.  Mm-hmm.  God, they're great.  What color?  Pink?  No, no.  The yellow one. 
[00:50:00]  Oh, the basic yellow?  Yeah.  I go with the pink.  Bite the heads off of those.  Yeah.  All right.  So if you're thinking of doing something different for Easter, this Easter bunny and bear gram  thing for the Vermont Teddy Bear Company sounds like a great idea.  You'll get the bear counselor on the line.  Sorry.  I'm still thinking about peeps.  1-800-829-BEAR.  And you can either order the Easter bunny bear gram or maybe something else.  So they got the chocolate lover bear, the spring fling bunny, or the Easter bear wearing bunny 
[00:50:30]  ears, Anthony.  How cute.  That would be cool.  Of course.  I think my girlfriend would like that.  Girls love this.  You think Jen would enjoy something like that?  Of course she would.  Oh, how cute.  Yeah.  You know.  We gave our chicks bears and they just freaked out.  Oh, yeah.  It really is a great gift.  It's different.  And the Vermont Teddy Bear Company has hundreds of bears to choose from.  So if none of these bears excite you or float your boat, well, you get on the phone with  the bear counselor.  You tell them a little bit about your lady and they'll suggest some bears for you. 
[00:51:00]  Yes.  A Passover bear?  Am I looking at that?  Get well.  New baby.  And Passover.  Wow.  That's different, too.  Look at that.  Every time these guys advertise on our show, they add more and more bears.  More bears.  A very aggressive company.  The Vermont Teddy Bear Company.  Give them a call.  Anthony, men's hair now.  Men's hair now.  Let me tell you.  Seeing is believing.  Yes.  That's the saying.  Yes.  We finally saw one of the clients from Men's Hair Now today.  Well, let's be honest.  Yesterday we did a live read for Men's Hair Now.  Mm-hmm. 
[00:51:30]  And they sounded great.  You know, what they told us.  They showed us some pictures and stuff.  We're like, okay, you guys seem pretty cool.  Um, but we didn't see any of the people live.  Mm-hmm.  So we had to see for ourselves.  Yes.  Listen how much more excited we are today.  Because they brought in this guy today.  And they showed us pictures of him and showed what he, you know, and we saw what he looks  like today because he was with us hanging.  We couldn't tell the difference.  Because I'll tell you something.  He came in with one of the people in sales down at the bottom of the stairs. 
[00:52:00]  We walked past him.  I didn't know why he was here.  Yeah.  I thought he was just maybe another one of our clients.  Right.  I had no idea this was the guy that had the procedure done.  And then they told us and we're like, yeah, right.  And then they showed us the proof.  I'm like, wow.  This is amazing.  Yeah.  I thought when they brought somebody in that I would be able to tell that he was wearing  something.  Mm-hmm.  Because most of the things that are available to bald guys look like hair hats.  Yeah.  They look awful. 
[00:52:30]  Looks like you got a Barbie doll head.  Right.  So I'm saying, all right, I got to see this.  They brought in a guy today.  Unbelievable.  Mm-hmm.  You cannot tell.  He was sitting how far away from us.  Two feet.  Yeah, two feet.  Not even.  I stood up to look at his hairline.  He had a natural hairline.  Was he wearing bangs, Opie?  Was he wearing hair that was in front of his face?  No.  He had his hair pulled back and he had a hairline, a natural hairline.  And we asked him a million questions.  He said he could swim, he could sweat, he could work out, anything. 
[00:53:00]  He doesn't care if it's raining outside.  He doesn't need an umbrella or a hat if he wants to get his hair wet.  He can.  I still want proof that he is a men's hair now client.  It looked that good.  Yeah.  And we did see the picture, so we know the guy's for real.  But honestly, you could hear the excitement in our voice.  We were amazed.  So you could call Men's Hair Now at 1-800-HAIR-202.  That's 1-800-HAIR-202 for Men's Hair Now.  Try on Men's Hair Now's Hair System 2000.  And if you like the way you look, sign up on the spot.

[00:54:00]  Or go to menshair.com.  All right, it's Opie and Anthony.  We've got to thank Ed and Ross from Collective Soul for stopping on by.  Very cool and down-to-earth guys.  That's what we like to see in our rock stars today.  Yeah.  You know, it's always hit or miss when a band comes in here.  You know, a lot of them are full of you-know-what.  They've got the tood.  You know, the rock tood coming on in.  Yeah, man.  No, these guys are cool, man.  But I met them in the beginning when they were just starting out.  And you know what?  Five years later, they're exactly the same.  That's cool.  They're humble. 
[00:54:30]  They're nice.  They'll do anything for the radio station that supports them.  Very good.  Unfortunately, their show is sold out tonight at the Bowery Ballroom.  But if you've got tickets, enjoy.  Have fun.  Now, I know we've got to play music here, but another one of our buddies is checking in.  We've got to say hi to them real fast.  Who's this?  Wayne Kribet.  Hello.  Wayne.  From the Jets.  How are you?  You blew us off.  What?  We had this lovely relationship going.  You guys were heading toward the Super Bowl.  And then all of a sudden, what happened to Wayne?  Are we live? 
[00:55:00]  Yeah.  Oh, you guys dished me, man.  What do you mean we dissed you?  How did we diss you?  We love you.  You would never diss you.  Falling down.  Huh?  Falling down?  Falling down in Denver.  Wait a minute.  Who said that?  What did we say?  I forget which one you said.  It was a while ago.  But ragging on me was one of the worst games of my life.  Wait a minute.  I defy anybody.  I could almost...  So that's what...  Almost word for word. 
[00:55:30]  Wait, so that's what...  And Wayne Kribet falls down.  Opie, why did you say that about Wayne?  On that one play you fell down and I said it wasn't your fault.  Well, it kind of was my fault, but...  Oh, well, see?  I was defending you, though.  Come on.  Wayne, remember, it was Opie.  If you want to kick his ass, feel free.  I'll watch.  I don't know.  One day, best friends.  Next day, you're in the...  Wait a minute.  Yeah, so that's why you haven't talked to us in three months?  No, no.  I've been away.  We had a...  We had a Bronco bashing party for you guys and everything. 
[00:56:00]  That scared the hell out of me when you guys did that.  Did you hear that on the radio?  That was sick.  No, someone told me about it, though.  It was crazy.  It was nuts.  They were flipping the Bronco and pulling pieces off it.  It was a great promotion.  We got, like, a front-page picture on the Jersey paper.  No kidding.  Which one?  Which one was it?  I forget now.  The Ledger.  What's the other one?  It was the other one.  I forgot.  No matter.  Whatever.  So what are you doing?  You guys are doing pretty well, huh?  Yeah, we're working on it.  Yeah, the boys still listening to the show a little bit? 
[00:56:30]  Or what?  Well, mostly, they pipe in WFAN, but...  Well, they got a...  Oh, yeah.  You got to listen to Mac and the Mad Dog.  Oh, jeez.  Well, Wayne, clip it on the phone.  No, no.  How are things going, Wayne?  Don't even go there.  I don't walk, man.  It gets a little annoying.  Right now, we've just been lifting weights and strength and conditioning and whatnot.  Yeah, getting ready.  I mean, come on.  You guys had a great year.  Oh, you know, no regrets there.  I mean, I think we still could beat Denver if everyone was on the game. 
[00:57:00]  Well, yeah, that was a frustrating game, to be honest with you.  Yeah, and it was...  For a lot of us, it was the first time.  I mean, we've got a lot of publicity and a lot of hype and a lot of things were expected,  but we're going to come back stronger next year.  Right.  Hey, those Denver fans, what a bunch of assholes.  Yeah, what did they do to your sister?  Well, there was a big story.  I forgot now, because it's been three months.  Yeah.  Didn't someone, like, spit on her, or what did they do?  No, they said some really unkind things in the paper out there, and someone did spit 
[00:57:30]  at her, but...  Oh, but didn't you get in a fight with a fan or something?  No.  What was the story, then?  I forgot.  It was something about...  I read something that his sister got pushed or something.  The media out there is...  It's pretty rough out there.  Yeah.  I don't know what they said or what have you, but...  Colorado.  What do you expect?  A bunch of mutants.  A bunch of rednecks out there.  They get there with their stupid buck-toothed Elway jerk-off.  God, did you hate just looking at that guy? 
[00:58:00]  With those teeth?  I don't know.  Since I was a kid, I've been watching him, so I really can't stand him, but...  Oh, and they're all just kissing his ass.  Could be the last appearance of Elway here.  Mile high.  Shut up!  Who cares about that guy?  I'm just going to hope he retires next year, though.  That's all right.  Oh, really?  Get him out of there.  I mean, uh...  So you guys are making some good deals on the side here during the off-season, huh?  Yeah, we're too okay.  My job security increased a little bit with the dismissal of Alex Van Dyke, and I'll tell 
[00:58:30]  you one thing, though.  After I slipped in the field there, I wasn't too short for a while.  Wait, I've got to ask you, because it happens to a lot of athletes.  How many times have you run that play in your head at night?  Uh, well, listening to WFAN and you guys...  Come on!  The first couple of days is kind of rough.  Oh, come on.  But, uh...  God, that's terrible, man. 
[00:59:00]  I keep thinking, there are a lot of times, there are a lot of what-ifs.  Right, yeah.  But I had a good season, I mean...  You did, man.  Yeah, and me and a few of the guys, we went down to watch the Super Bowl and watch the  Pro Bowl and, um, get the feeling as if, what if we were there and what could we have  done?  Uh-huh.  And, um, yeah, we had a good time, but it was, uh...  It was...  We were getting pumped up for this year.  Yeah.  Oh, that sucks, though.  It's kind of like watching some guy doing your girlfriend, you know?  You're watching the Super Bowl, you're like, that should be me!  Come on! 
[00:59:30]  And, um, damn, if only I got her flowers more often.  Yeah, there's a lot of what-ifs.  But, uh...  Yeah, I think overall, I mean, except for a few plays that could have gone either way,  you know, we could have pulled it out.  Had the, uh, the toonie treat you after the game.  I'm sorry?  Had the tuna treat you after the game.  Oh, he went, no problems at all.  Yeah?  I mean, uh, I think the only thing that he had made strong recommendations to me personally,  uh, was he wants to see me wearing gloves and, uh...  Uh, especially in the cold weather, the long-sleeved shirts. 
[01:00:00]  He made it very clear to me.  Yeah, your arms get slippery, don't they?  I don't know.  I've never had a problem in the past, but he seems to think that, um, you know, it's his team.  I mean, you turn to him and say, I'd like to see you, uh, eating celery.  No, I mean, I've never had a problem in the past, but, uh...  Yeah.  Uh, it's just, uh, just, uh, some strong encouragement to...  Oh, man, don't be hard on yourself.  You had a great year.  The team had a great year.  No, it felt good, except, you know, I was under the weather just before the Denver game. 
[01:00:30]  Yeah, I remember, because we had you on the air.  Yeah.  But, uh, God, I'm kind of bummed that you heard us say that you fell down.  No.  I couldn't believe I got slammed.  It was just, uh, it was in the car.  Yeah.  And...  Oh, was that awful?  I...  My people are just letting me down.  Oh, wait a minute.  Can we make it up to you?  We'd throw these, like, naked, uh, chick parties now.  We'll invite you down for one.  There is no way I'm going to that place to be spanked or, uh... 
[01:01:00]  Just be trouble.  No.  No way in the world.  Obviously, he's got a girlfriend.  No comment.  I don't know.  Maybe, maybe you were listening to, uh, Mike, though.  Mike and the Mad Dog.  Yeah.  Maybe that was it.  I can't stand, uh, Mike and the Mad Dog.  I'll listen to the fellas in the morning, but, uh, they make me too nervous to just, uh...  They're always, like, critiquing everything.  I think if, uh, Wayne would, uh, tie his shoelaces a little different, uh, that might, uh, help his game.  Right, Mikey?  The dog makes me nuts.  And you guys do a great imitation of that. 
[01:01:30]  Who does the imitation of that?  Well, I started out with the Mad Dog impersonation, and everyone thought I did a pretty good job.  It's the only impression I could do, and then Anthony takes it and makes it even better.  I hate him.  I had a wasted youth of much too much television, so, uh, I just started imitating everything.  You guys used to do TV?  I'm like a retarded minor bird.  No, I watched too much television.  I did TV for many years.  Hey, how's Yoshi been?  Hey, Paul!  Hi, yo, you are, you are, you ask about me. 
[01:02:00]  I love the game of football.  Very good.  Football looks like big pork roast.  That was great.  We were out on the call, and I listened to that.  We just had a ball.  Yeah.  So what are you doing in the off-season?  Anything fun?  Doing a lot of working out.  Yeah.  Like I said, in the off-season, I went to Hawaii and, um...  Nice.  Checked out the, uh, the Pro Bowl.  And, um, you know, uh, that was, uh, Vintessa Verde Street.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  And, um, I just enjoyed myself.  It was, uh, to get some sunshine and fresh air and clear my head. 
[01:02:30]  Right.  And, um, and, uh, I spent some time down in Florida.  Mm-hmm.  Spent time with my folks, and, uh, now I'm back home and, um, just, you know, just stay  in shape.  Yeah.  Give our condolences to Vinny's, uh, family, man.  Yeah.  That blew.  It was, uh, I don't know.  It was kind of upsetting, but, uh, I don't know.  I think everyone handled it really well.  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And, uh, Vinny's got a strong family.  And, you know, at least the family is finally back at home, uh, again with Vinny back in 
[01:03:00]  town.  Right.  Cool.  So, he's got his head.  You know, he's, everything's in perspective.  Right.  Well, when are you coming down to visit with us?  Well, as long as you guys behave yourself.  All right.  If I guarantee there'll be no naked women around, can you come down?  No spankings.  No, uh, no spanking.  Well, are you allowed to come down and watch someone else get spanked?  I don't want to get...  You know you want to check this out.  Who are you kidding?  I could go to your website if I want to check it out.  You guys are too dangerous there, and I might get locked in there with, uh... 
[01:03:30]  Well, how about if we lock you in another studio that's adjacent, and you won't be able  to touch the girls?  How about if I, like, cross the street in the next building?  Binoculars.  Come on.  We want you down here for one of these parties.  Well, we'll talk about it at a time.  The girl in the black there.  It looks kind of rough.  Oh, yeah.  Uh, Spike.  Spike.  Spike is a tough broad.  Yeah, she's our hardcore champion, we call her.  But that blood looks pretty hot, though.  Which one?  Tara?  Uh, yeah. 
[01:04:00]  The first one, yeah.  Yeah, Tara's pretty hot.  We like her.  Yeah.  I told a friend of mine out in California to check into your website there, and he really  got a kick out of that.  Oh, cool.  Yeah.  Well, we're finding someone to take on Tara as the hottest girl to ever appear naked on  the show.  Well, how's the search going?  Well, we've got four contestants on the website right now.  Make sure you vote.  Uh, all right.  Sure.  It's tough to get on because the site's getting pounded.  We're getting like 50,000 hits a day right now.  Hey, I'll bone speak with you guys. 
[01:04:30]  Uh-oh.  I wrote you a note email, and you never sent back.  Well, we're getting a lot...  I couldn't get through on the, uh, on that line that, uh, the ad until Rick paged me with  this, this new one.  Well, we'll give you the, the, the, the private line.  I think I have it now, I guess.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  None of that email.  It's tough to get to all the email, to be honest with you.  We're still reading email that came in three months ago.  You know, but we're trying to read all of it.  Yeah.  Well, I guess popularity goes to some people's heads.  Well, it's...  There you go. 
[01:05:00]  Look at you, man.  Where you guys should be broadcasting next year from?  Shut up.  We're going to try to keep this job.  What was that meant about the mayor of Boston dying?  Yeah.  You too, you know too much about us.  No, I was looking through it on the way home last night.  Oh, last night?  Yeah, it's a year ago that we got, uh, fired.  April Fool's gag.  Oh, man.  Kind of went awry.  That must have gone to a real big.  Well...  Oof.  Man.  Talk about falling on the field.  We fell flat on our faces. 
[01:05:30]  We fell flat on our faces.  No patting, huh?  We were not picked up.  No.  For the next season.  They really threw you out of Boston for that?  Oh, they wanted our heads.  Literally.  They tried to sue us.  They tried everything.  We were being, uh, followed by, uh, camera crews for two weeks straight.  Are you kidding me?  We couldn't go into a restaurant, a mall, nothing.  We were hoping something happened that week in the news.  That would have bumped it out.  But it was the most boring news week ever.  So for the whole week, they just, two DJs say the mayor's dead. 
[01:06:00]  And it just didn't stop.  Wayne, they set up a live shot on my front lawn.  Get out.  So I'm watching the news and I'm like, wait a minute, that's a shot from my freaking house.  And I look outside, there's the reporter.  It was ridiculous.  I don't know.  We've got new security at the complex.  Yeah.  Last, as of last year.  And they're pretty good.  And, uh, old Harry was getting on in years.  And, uh, I mean, he's been there since, since I was like in grammar school.  Really?  Before I was born.  I don't know.  Yeah. 
[01:06:30]  But, um, you know, things are a little, things are a little better there.  And if you don't want to talk to someone, you don't have to.  Oh, yeah.  But, um.  No, when we got fired, like the company that we were with, they didn't even want to know  us anymore.  So now we had no one to protect us.  It was scary.  Whew.  It was scary.  Well, where are you going next year?  Well, we're going to shut up this, uh, this April 1st.  Believe me.  Supposedly they're going to.  I don't buy that.  What are you guys planning?  No, supposedly they're going to, like, they're thinking of giving us the day off.  They don't trust us.  I don't trust you either. 
[01:07:00]  So we'll just come back, uh, we'll come back on April 2nd and say that, uh, Giuliani's  a transvestite.  No, we want to keep this job now that we're building an audience.  For a while there, we thought we didn't want to keep this job.  Oof.  Giuliani doesn't have enough hair to be a transvestite.  Beluga whale head.  Oh, man.  Did you hear our show when we came up with 500 nicknames for Giuliani's head?  No.  Oh, that was a great show.  Yeah, pretty fun.  That was great.  500 nicknames?  Yeah, Simon Barsinister was my fave. 
[01:07:30]  He looks like he's wearing a football helmet without the face guard.  Doesn't he?  And a little tough to hair.  He's rough, man.  I've seen this kid on TV.  Really?  Yeah.  So what else do you guys?  All right.  Well, we'll let you go.  Okay.  Was this the whole thing on the air?  Oh, yeah.  This is what we do.  We're on the air.  Okay.  We used to be a lot more careful.  Our whole life is on the air.  These days, we really don't care.  No.  Let me say a little about family.  And I doubt they're listening, but...  Go ahead, man.  Yeah, Mom, Dad, wish you the best, and I'll see you real soon. 
[01:08:00]  Okay.  And you fellas, take care and stay in touch, okay?  Well, Wayne, man, you know, don't be down on us.  No, not down at all.  Because we thought we made a connection with you, and we were kind of bummed when you didn't  check in for like three months.  No, I was out of ten hours.  And we apologize that you heard that, that you heard that.  He's not apologizing about saying it.  I just had to reset the dials, you know, the radio thing for the car.  Oh, look at you.  Come on.  That's all I had to do.  And you will be coming down here the next wild party we throw. 
[01:08:30]  We'll make sure you're in no pictures, and you won't touch the ladies.  You know, any handcuffs come on me, someone's going down.  All right.  Hey, fellas, stay cool.  Good luck to you, all right?  Take it easy, Wayne.  Say hello to the guys.  Bye-bye.  Hold on for a sec.  Okay.  Wayne Corbett from the Jets check-in.  Very cool.  Good guy, man.  Oh, I can't believe you heard that show.  What are you, crazy?  Yeah, I guess.  I don't remember exactly what you said.  If you just reported accurately what happened on the field, that's one thing.  But if you started giving him some crap. 
[01:09:00]  I don't think we did, though.  We're going to have to pull the tape.  I think being a huge Jet fan, I was just, you know, I was frustrated like everyone else.  But that wasn't a play that made or broke the game.  You know?  All right.  All right, Wayne Corbett, everyone.  We'll get him in here.  Yeah.  The Rock of New York, 1027 WNEW, Stone Temple Pilots, sex-type thing, and plush.  You're hanging with Opie and Anthony.  Oi.  Got to hand it to the faithful listeners for just pounding the website with the four girls on it. 
[01:09:30]  Yeah, yeah.  We have 22,000 votes in thus far for the next challenger for Tara.  We're going to announce the winner Friday because the problem is a lot of people still haven't seen the photos, believe it or not, from Friday's party.  I am hearing it from the people, Opie.  They're saying that the web server is very slow, having a hard time getting connected to it.  Mm-hmm.  It's just getting pounded. 
[01:10:00]  Yeah.  I noticed it's a lot easier to get on after we leave.  Exactly.  So at night.  That's what I was going to suggest.  Yeah.  I mean, right now, it's almost impossible.  But after we get off the air or late tonight.  You know, when we're done with our show and the emphasis is on music, maybe you could hit the website and then you could get something, you know.  You could get through, I'm sure.  So wait for the wife to go to bed and then punch up the pictures tonight.  Right.  Late night when you're supposedly doing online banking.  Yeah. 
[01:10:30]  Honey, I'm banking.  Right.  Doing that banking.  Three in the morning.  But we need all the faithful listeners to get their vote in for the four girls that are on the website right now to see who's going to take on Tara.  Mm-hmm.  And we just upped the ante.  It looks like Priceline.com is coming through for us.  They're going to give away a trip to the winner of this contest.  That's good.  All right.  That's real good.  It's very good.  Because we'll get some class acts in here.  Well, Taryn, a bunch of other people kind of expressed to us they want this contest to stay a little classier than it has been lately, Anthony. 
[01:11:00]  I don't understand.  What's the problem?  I don't know.  We kind of had a party atmosphere in here Friday.  Yeah.  Maybe things got a little crazy, but I don't know if the class factor dipped any lower than it.  Okay, it did.  But I think people are appreciating it.  Of course.  For sure.  Most people enjoyed it.  Yes.  And that'll be cool.  So one of the ladies will be winning a trip from Priceline.com.  Great. 
[01:11:30]  Yeah.  And then we're just going to keep upping the ante until who knows.  Until we get a supermodel walking through the door.  That'll be cool.  All right.  I've got to say hi to John the Elevator Man from Jersey.  You guys are the best.  Listen every day.  Keep up the good work.  Just inducted into the Hummer Club ten minutes ago.  Thanks.  Later, guys.  We're not hearing from a lot of people getting inducted today.  Well, we haven't talked about it that much.  It doesn't mean it's not happening.  I think a lot of people are doing it. 
[01:12:00]  Privacy, they're on home.  You think everyone's been inducted at this point?  Is our job done, Anthony?  Did we get every guy in the New York area a Hummer at this point?  I don't think so.  That would be nice.  Our job here is done.  We can move on.  I can dream, can I?  Yes.  All right.  I think tomorrow we start our new little thing.  Yeah, we might have to fade out the Tuesday Night Hummer Club if this Wednesday thing takes off.  And then we'll bring back the Tuesday Night Hummer Club in the fall or something.  It may be time to rest the Tuesday Night Hummer Club.  I don't know. 
[01:12:30]  I don't know either.  We'll see.  I know the guys are like, what are you nuts?  Hey, Mike.  Hello.  Hey, what do you got?  Hey, I just wrote a song about the Hummer Club.  I thought you guys might like to hear it.  Ooh.  It's sung to the tune of Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.  Come on.  How are you going to pull this off?  Oh, well, you'll hear it.  From Mary Poppins.  I got to do it without music, though.  And it's called the Super Tuesday Hummer Club, and that's one word.  Okay.  Okay?  And here goes.  Don't mind.  It's with no music, so here we go. 
[01:13:00]  Uh-oh.  Oh, my name's Michael, by the way.  I'm from Havistar up in Rockland County.  Rockland County.  All right, Mikey.  These two guys on the radio, they made up a game.  I guess we should be more precise.  The club's a better name.  And for all to join this club, you have to take a chance.  Super Tuesday Hummer Club.  It's time to drop your pants.  Oh, Super Tuesday Hummer Club.  Oh, it feels delicious.  And they say the juice that comes might really be nutritious.  If you practice hard enough, he'll really know what bliss is. 
[01:13:30]  Super Tuesday Hummer Club.  Oh, it feels delicious.  Humbed it a little bit.  Humbed it a lot.  Humbed it a little bit.  Humbed it a lot.  Second verse.  Oh, man.  I got my girl to join, and every Tuesday is just fine.  We're very loyal members, and she likes to take her time.  But now I'm getting greedy, and I have to let her know that it feels good just like it should.  But two for Tuesday is how to go.  Oh, Super Tuesday Hummer Club.  Oh, it feels delicious.  And they say the juice that comes might really be nutritious. 
[01:14:00]  If you practice hard enough, he'll really know what bliss is.  Super Tuesday Hummer Club.  Oh, it feels delicious.  Humbed it a little bit.  Humbed it a lot.  Third verse.  No, no, no, no.  Oh, that's the best one.  This guy's got your name in it.  You got to leave on and up.  These guys, Opie and Anthony, they really are a dream.  I'm glad that they made up this club.  Just go, guys can cream.  But now they have to come up with a club just for the girls.  The Monday Munch, a bunch of bush.  Hey, let's give that a whirl.  Okay, that's it. 
[01:14:30]  I think you should have stopped after the first verse.  Oh, okay.  Great job.  Bravo.  That was pretty good, man.  Yeah, we'll give you a hand there.  All right.  Very good, though.  I like your show.  You guys are great.  Hey, thanks.  We appreciate that.  Thank you very much.  All right, buddy.  Bye.  The vocal stylings.  Of Mike.  Of Mike.  All right.  All right, it's Opie and Anthony.  And this is kind of interesting.  On the phone is Wayne Krabat.  Wayne.  Yeah.  The real Wayne Krabat.  Now, you don't sound like the Wayne Krabat that was on our show about a half hour ago. 
[01:15:00]  No, no, no.  That was a forgery.  That was a fake.  So it's exactly...  This is like What's My Line or something.  It's like a retarded game show or something.  Wait a minute.  Now, you are Wayne Krabat.  I am Wayne Krabat.  Go to New Jersey.  You play with the New York Jets.  I'm going to play by the United Stadium.  Well, how can we prove that you're the Wayne Krabat and the other guy is an imposter?  Well, the next time the imposter calls, ask him some kind of football question or something 
[01:15:30]  he might not know that maybe...  Well, he knew...  No, no, off the air, I'll give you a tidbit about myself.  Maybe he's definitely not going to know.  Well, he knew that there was a security guard at the stadium named, what, Hank?  Harry.  Harry, whatever.  I mean, but that was common knowledge in the paper.  That, you know, that guy wouldn't let me in when I was a rookie because he thought I was a student.  So...  I don't know.  What's this guy's motivation, I wonder, then, if he wants to... 
[01:16:00]  I don't know, man.  He faxed us with some Jets letterhead.  Right.  Also.  Well, my father has Jets letterhead, and he's pretty crazy, too, but he's not faxing yet.  I mean, I get, like, a lot, a lot of fan mail, and, I mean, you know, you get all different  types.  You know, I get asked...  You know, I get pictures from, you know, lonely housewives to, you know, any kind of  person you want.  All right.  You're sending this, sending that.  So, you know, there's all different kind of people out there.  So, Wayne, what are you doing on the offseason? 
[01:16:30]  Let's just run through this again.  What's that?  I actually just got back from Jamaica.  I did, uh...  You know, you remember when you said the Jeep Eagle Superstars?  Yeah.  Well, I did that this weekend.  They're actually airing it next Saturday and Sunday coming up.  If you might remember, the other Wayne Corbett was in Hawaii.  No, I was in Hawaii for the Pro Bowl.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Hey, what do you say about that?  Did he say why he went down?  Well, yeah, he said that he was getting laid a lot. 
[01:17:00]  No, he didn't.  No, no, no.  He said he was there for the Pro Bowl, you know, watching.  All right.  Because, no, no.  Vinny, actually, Vinny Testaverde took me down.  Yeah.  So, he didn't get that right.  Ah.  He should have got that right, though, because it was in the paper.  Yeah, he did.  Well, if the other Wayne Corbett's listening, you've got to call in now and confess.  What, dueling Corbett's?  Great.  Well, no, but if the guy scammed us, we love when people scam us.  We'll admit it.  If you put this on the air, just say, that ain't cool.  Well, no, you're on the air live, dude. 
[01:17:30]  All right.  Don't do something like that.  I don't know what your angle is, but that's not cool.  Don't do that, man.  And I work hard to keep a clean-cut image and, you know, do the right thing, so I don't need  someone trying to ruin it for me.  Well, that's why, if indeed he is not the Wayne Corbett and you are, he didn't say anything  that would trigger us to think that it wasn't you or him because he wasn't bashing you or  anything.  It seemed like your persona, you know? 
[01:18:00]  Nice guy.  I don't know, man.  Maybe he likes me.  Well, maybe he likes you.  That's scary.  And that makes it even scarier than I really want him to stop.  I know there's only one Wayne Corbett in the world.  Well, do you like our radio show?  Yeah, man.  You've got good stuff.  I think you guys are very funny.  Come on.  At least there's a common thread here.  You sure he's not your twin brother or something?  Nine out of ten Wayne Corbett surveyed like the Opie and Anthony show.  I have no brothers.  There's another Wayne Corbett in the world. 
[01:18:30]  That's my father, but that certainly wasn't him on the phone.  Yeah.  Even though he wants to be me sometimes, that wasn't him.  He wouldn't go that far.  Man, this is bizarre.  This is strange.  Because you guys kind of have the same persona like Anthony was saying.  Yeah.  And he knows a lot about you.  Opie, Joe Willie Namitz on line two, four, and seven.  That's the thing.  I don't know, man.  That's scary.  Yeah, it is.  I said that's real scary.  Well, Wayne, can we make it up to you and have you come in for our next naked girl party? 
[01:19:00]  Wait.  Hey.  You got some naked girl party going on?  Hey, here's the real Wayne Corbett.  It is the real Wayne.  If anybody knows me, they know I'll be there.  I'll be the first on line.  I'll hand out tickets, man.  I'm serious.  If you want to get down here, we're going to be doing something soon.  Where are you guys located?  We're in 57th, 7th, Manhattan.  Because, yeah, I'm calling.  I'm like, I'm listening to the radio station.  I'm like, say the damn number so I can call in.  And I'm trying to call in for your phone number for information. 
[01:19:30]  Yeah.  But you know what?  I'm in the city a lot.  I'm going to drop down one of these days, and face-to-face, I'll match the face with the voice.  Definitely.  All right.  Please stop by soon.  Because we've got to put an end to this.  Yeah, definitely.  If Num Nuts calls back, tell him to go to his other split personality, because this one ain't working.  You think he's using your name to get laid and stuff?  Hey, man.  If it's working for him, I don't want to get down.  Let's just don't go on the radio.  He's going to call next time as Keyshawn. 
[01:20:00]  Hey, I might call as him and give him some bad rap.  Yeah, he might be using your name to go in the gay clubs and stuff.  Oh, come on.  That's awful.  Can you imagine?  That just has to suck.  I don't even want to think about that, man.  All the ladies out there, I'm straight as can be.  There you go.  Any news I know, you know that's a fact.  Wayne, we've got to make this up to you, and we're going to bring you down for our next Naked Girl party.  All right, man.  I'm serious.  And if you're the real Wayne Corbett, we apologize. 
[01:20:30]  Yeah, we apologize.  We have been scared.  Confusion.  I got the number that I called again, touching you guys.  Yeah.  What time are you guys on the air from?  Three to seven.  Next time I'm in the city, man, I'm calling that number, and I'm telling them to buzz me in because I'm coming up.  No, just come in.  You're an open invite, all right?  I appreciate it, man.  This is unbelievable.  Hey, screen your calls, man.  You're right.  Hold on.  You sound a lot like the other guy, though, I must say, you know.  Oh, man.  How's your offseason going?  It's fine. 
[01:21:00]  Fine.  Well, we got all those answers from the other Wayne Corbett, so we don't need to go through it again.  No, I'm going to say, how am I doing?  Oh, Jesus.  You're doing pretty well.  Yeah.  I mean, it sounds like this guy's got me down pat.  And he's not even brave enough to call back in to confront you.  He hasn't called back.  So I must say, you have to be the real thing.  He'll probably wait until you hang up and then call up and go, who was that in five?  Who was that?  All right.  We'll get to the bottom of this before seven. 
[01:21:30]  Hey, Wayne, hold on the line for a minute, right?  I sure will, man.  All right.  Line two is a little controversy here on the Opie and Anthony show.  Line two is another Wayne Corbett.  Line three, Wayne Corbett.  Wait, line three, Wayne Corbett?  Where's Kitty Carlisle?  Hi, N.E.W.  Hi, this is Wayne Corbett.  I couldn't resist, guys.  Okay, listen.  So which one do you think was the real Wayne Corbett, the first guy or the second guy? 
[01:22:00]  Number two, man.  Number two.  Yeah.  Number two is obvious, huh?  Yeah.  Now we've got to make it up to him and throw him a naked girl party.  Absolutely, guys.  You guys are great, man.  Hey, thanks.  Thanks, Wayne.  All right.  Hi, N.E.W.  Yeah, hi.  Hi.  How are you doing?  All right.  I just want to tell you guys, I think you guys are great.  I've been listening to your show for since you guys have been on.  Hey, thanks, man.  And I just got my girlfriend into listening to you guys the last couple of months. 
[01:22:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  And she loves you guys, too.  She loves the Yoshi skit.  And I've been telling her about the thing you do with Donald Duck and all in the family, Archie and Edith.  Right.  If you can play those two skits so she can hear them, that would be great.  I'd really appreciate it.  I listen to you guys all day.  I drive for a living, so I'm on the road all day, and I just look forward to 3 o'clock every day to listen to you guys.  That makes our day.  Thanks.  Yeah.  It's really...  You guys are great, and she loves you, too. 
[01:23:00]  She loves Yoshi, too.  All right on.  But she never heard the Edith thing and the Donald Duck thing.  You know what I'm talking about.  All right, listen.  You're live on the air.  I'm going to hang up with you, and we're going to play a twofer of, you know, Hummer, whatever you just asked for.  Yeah, the Donald Duck thing.  You know what I'm talking about.  All right, we'll start...  With a towel, and...  Yeah, yeah.  Can I get you a towel?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We'll start with the Donald Duck, and we'll do the Edith as soon as I hang up with you.  All right, great.  Thank you very much.  You guys are great.  Hey, thanks, man.  All right.  Bye-bye.  All right, for that guy, we'll...  Can you believe this, dude? 
[01:23:30]  I totally had me, man.  Yeah, we like when, you know, we get scammed without a towel.  That's a good job, because he didn't do anything where, at the end, you know, there was a Baba Booey or F. Jackie or anything, yeah?  Right, right, right.  So, I figured it was totally legit.  Hey, man, we love a good prank like anyone else.  Sure, that's funny, man.  We pulled our pranks, though.  I'm going to hear from that guy.  Yeah, call back, the fake Wayne for Betty. </pre>
