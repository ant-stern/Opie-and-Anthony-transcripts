<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with an analysis of a news blooper by Ernie Anastas, who accidentally said "fucking" on air.  This led to a broader discussion of on-air cursing by news personalities, featuring clips of Shepard Smith, Kyra Phillips, and others, alongside clips showcasing various other on-air gaffes.  The hosts contrasted the treatment of Anastas with how radio personalities would be handled for similar offenses.  This discussion was interspersed with commentary on *Sex and the City*'s Samantha Jones and her explicit dialogue, further discussions about obtaining fishing licenses for a trip with Bob Kelly, and complaints about taxes and government regulations.  No guests were present in studio during this portion, only Opie and Anthony.

The show then shifted to a proposed Google bomb targeting Cindy Crawford's mole, along with brief mentions of Olivia Wilde and Sue Simmons' on-air outburst.  A significant portion was dedicated to a promotional bit for a fictional SiriusXM channel, "The Manhole," featuring a mock promo with suggestive language and a studio appearance by Cherry and Melissa, who brought a vibrator.  The hosts also critiqued a Trojan vibrating finger massager commercial.

A substantial segment was devoted to criticizing Mancow Muller, featuring clips of his past stunts (a staged car crash and self-performed waterboarding).  The hosts mocked Muller's style and dishonesty, discussed his failed attempts at conservative political commentary, and played a phone call demonstrating a screener instructing a caller to excessively praise Muller before asking a question.  Opie and Anthony expressed outrage at Muller's 9/11 response, focusing on the Merchandise Mart, and further criticized his self-aggrandizement and dishonesty, including a discussion of a prank call Anthony made to Muller's show.

The next segment started with a discussion of a news story potentially involving a UK-US international incident. This was followed by a profanity-laced discussion about a caller, "ManCal," whose show they had interrupted earlier.  This transitioned into playing and reacting to more clips of newscasters making on-air mistakes, including a weatherman saying "keep fucking that chicken" and a newsreader yelling "fuck you, mother whore."  Jimmy then recounted his interactions with Sharon Osbourne, describing his close relationship with the Osbourne family, culminating in Sharon sending him a thank-you email and flowers.  The hosts jokingly accused Jimmy of ingratiating himself.  This was followed by audio of Jimmy introducing Ozzy Osbourne on stage. The segment concluded with a discussion of a fight between news anchors and a critique of a KISS interview on WGN, where the band primarily promoted their tour and merchandise, with Gene Simmons receiving particular criticism.  A brief discussion about the world's tallest man and his everyday struggles also took place.

The world's tallest man then appeared in studio, prompting jokes about his height and appearance from the hosts.  A caller recounted a negative experience related to a previous on-air comment. This was followed by interactions with fake "Larry King" callers, and a discussion of a Jeffrey Epstein deposition transcript, involving highly graphic and sexually suggestive questions about Epstein's penis.  The hosts made numerous jokes and vulgar descriptions of Epstein's genitalia.  The segment also included discussions of movie previews (*Love Happens* and *Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs*), the upcoming football season, the Yankees' winning streak, and Michael Jackson's mother's payments for caring for his children. The segment ended with an expletive-laden elevator repair service prank call and further banter.  Cherry and Melissa briefly reappeared, showcasing a sex toy.

The show’s penultimate segment involved the hosts reading listener-submitted "lines of the day," which were sexually explicit and graphically violent. Jimmy discussed his upcoming appearance on Jay Leno and rescheduling Long Island shows. He also promoted shows in Kansas City and Buffalo.  A comedic bit focused on Jimmy's flustered reaction to the hosts' attempts to build anticipation for a show intro, involving a combination of Jimmy’s Ozzy Osbourne-style entrance and Opie's STP intro. Concerns were raised about the self-harm potential of the STP segment. The segment ended abruptly with expletive-laden exchanges and the hosts expressing their desire to leave early.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Oh, we got your live programming right here on 202, the Opie and Anthony Show.  Ready for broadcast.  I like the fact when we start the show, you put the boss's voice right at the end there.  Yes.  Good old Jay Leno.  We had to bury the Jay Leno thing for a little while because, you know, he was gone.  It was sounding a little dated, and now he's back with his new show.  And we get to bring that right back for everybody.  That's right, Opie.  You keep fucking that chicken. 
[00:00:30]  I just love saying it for no apparent reason.  Ernie Anastas.  I was trying to explain.  How do I explain it to the listeners?  I explained Ernie Anastas perfectly to you this morning, and I don't even want to mention the guy's name that I used as an example.  But there are people, you probably know them.  Yeah, sure.  That they are completely clueless.  They're, like, in space all the time.  Yep.  But they're able to pull off that they're not in space. 
[00:01:00]  Yeah, they kind of, they can do their job.  And people that see them doing their job think, wow, that guy's on the ball.  He knows what he's doing.  But if you just look at him for maybe five seconds, you realize, oh, my God, this guy's in space and faking everything.  He has no clue.  He barely has a clue where he is right now.  Yeah.  They're called Club Soda Kennys.  And Ernie Anastas is one of those guys.  One of those guys.  He knows how to read.  He's a good news reader. 
[00:01:30]  They're all just news readers.  He reads the news.  But if you asked him, like, a follow-up question, kind of like the Bob Kelly thing that Jimmy does, you ask him one question, that Ernie Anastas is going to completely fall apart.  Yep.  Completely.  He has no idea he said fucking on his newscast.  He has no idea.  They had to tell him.  Ernie, when will the person actually be arrested for the crime?  I think...  He's one of those guys. 
[00:02:00]  There's no fucking clue.  I don't know if I explained it well, but he doesn't have a clue.  No.  He made a little faux pas on the air.  Yeah, let's go back to the faux pas.  A little faux pas.  I think this is what happened.  And this has happened to me before, where you say something, and you know what you meant to say, but in between your brain and mouth,  because you were thinking something else, the actual word that you were thinking comes out.  Right.  So if he says, he says, initially he said he meant to say plucking, but if he's thinking real quick, like this happens in a second in your head, 
[00:02:30]  but you have this conversation in a split second.  Yeah.  So he's going, all right, we're talking about chicken thing.  I said this line.  Let me say, you know, keep plucking that chicken.  It sounds like fucking, so it'll be funny and a little shocking and something like that.  So I'll say that.  Hey, you keep fucking that chicken.  Holy shit.  I just said fucking instead of plucking. 
[00:03:00]  I think that's exactly what happened.  That makes sense.  I think you meant to say fucking, but it happens all the time.  You mean to say one thing, and the other thing you were thinking about in that weird split second conversation comes out of your mouth.  I know we talk about radio a lot and the inner workings, but I got to tell you this.  If someone did what Ernie Anastas did on regular radio, nine out of ten times they would be fired immediately.  Well, no, right now there would be an internal investigation where really all they're doing is seeing who else knew about it and just get them all out of the fucking studio. 
[00:03:30]  Right.  They would be fired, though.  Yeah, there would be a suspension and then a firing.  And I'm sick of radio.  Actually, I'm sick of us.  I'm sure the listeners are, too.  Being the scourge of the media.  I'm just so sick of it.  I don't know what happened, but in the last couple of years, I'm just so sick of the fact that there is completely different roles for radio guys and TV guys. 
[00:04:00]  It just drives me nuts.  We have way more intelligence than Ernie Anastas.  Way more.  Who is he?  He's just a stupid newsreader, and he said, fuck.  You know, I don't think anyone should be fired for making a mistake, but if you're going to fire radio guys, then Ernie Anastas should beat it.  And here's the big thing also is when you tune into this program, you pretty much know what you're getting.  And on terrestrial radio, it was the same thing.  You tune into the Opie and Anthony show, you knew what you were getting. 
[00:04:30]  If you heard the word fuck inadvertently slip out, you probably first wouldn't be offended because you're listening to the show.  Sure.  We'll play some of the old bits.  You tell me the word fuck would offend you.  Sure.  You watch the news.  There's an instance where you might be offended because you don't expect that at all out of the news.  Right.  So we probably should get away with saying fuck on terrestrial radio sooner than Ernie Anastas should get away with saying fuck on the news.  Abso-fucking-lutely, Anthony. 
[00:05:00]  I think we really need TV cameras in here so we get a little more respect.  You keep blowing that horse, Opie.  Oh, Jiminy Cricket.  Oh, did I say that?  The best part of the video, I tweeted the video for everybody yesterday.  But the best part of the video is not Ernie Anastas saying fuck.  No.  It's the, I don't know her name.  Her peepers.  She was filling in for Rosanna Scotto or whatever and her eyes got big like the dude in the rowboat fishing in Caddyshack. 
[00:05:30]  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Her eyes literally bugged out like, what?  They bugged out of her head and then she kind of squinted a little, looked over like, oh, my God.  Did he just fucking say that?  And those eyes were all about this.  I hope they don't fire me too.  Oh, my God.  I had nothing to do with this.  Ernie should say he wasn't saying anything.  She's a really good ventriloquist.  And it was her.  Look at her face.  Yeah, they froze her face.  Like, that is utter horror.  Look, Ernie's laughing and she is horrified that he just said fuck on the air. 
[00:06:00]  What a great shot that is.  Look at Ernie.  Ernie's like, oh, did I say fuck?  No.  That's right before.  He has no idea.  That's the whole point.  He just doesn't know.  With big teeth, like, look, everyone's reacting to me.  She looks like she just sat on the fucking, a big fist that you buy at an adult store.  Wouldn't it be great if you could ask them exactly what's going on right now?  If she could say, well, it's common knowledge around here that Ernie fucks turkeys. 
[00:06:30]  And when he said chicken, we immediately knew there was going to be some type of a problem.  Because the turkey had to have hurt it.  Oh, shit.  That is a great shot.  Well, just in case you missed it.  I mean, it is a, this is a massive video on YouTube.  Oh, yeah.  You want to talk about going viral, this fucking thing.  A lot of people.  Nothing is stopping this one anytime soon.  No.  Even though he apologized last night and, you know, he's just going to move on.  But this is the audio of the incident.  Fox 5 Sky Guardian and then check that Saturday to make your weekend plans. 
[00:07:00]  Takes a tough man to make a tender forecast, Nick.  I guess that's me.  Keep fucking that chicken.  Okay, I'll do that.  All right.  When we continue.  Okay, I'll do that.  Also, the weatherman's response of, okay, I'll do that, is like, they're just oblivious.  Because they're just dumb newsreaders.  Those people don't listen to each other.  They don't listen to themselves.  They just look at the words and read the words.  Like, he should have just turned around and went, Ernie, did you just suggest I have sex with a chicken? 
[00:07:30]  Right.  And Ernie would be like, what?  I don't do that.  I'll keep fucking that chicken, Ernie.  Thank you.  And Ernie's just like, ha, ha, ha, look at me being funny.  Ha, ha, ha, fucking chicken.  How did Ernie respond?  Did he apologize for it?  Yeah, last night.  Last night's news, he apologized.  I haven't heard the apology.  I heard it's really lame.  Yeah, I heard it on the way in.  Where the fuck are you?  Can I say the greatest thing ever would be is if after tonight's broadcast, they ended and he said something.  He goes, all right, you keep licking that cow pussy.  And then I certainly will. 
[00:08:00]  I said the same thing in the office.  Oh, did you?  When I was coming in today, we were talking about it in the office.  I didn't hear you.  I know.  I was like, it would be great if he was just like,  ha, ha, ha, you keep blowing that horse.  And just like, Ernie, what are you doing?  I apologize for the horse blowing.  Again.  And he just does it every night.  That's his, like, sign off.  All right.  Sex with animal statements.  You keep fingering that cat angrily.  All right, I'll do that, Ernie.  Fucking Ernie.  You can not love Ernie. 
[00:08:30]  Hey, Ernie, you want to fuck a chicken?  You've got a job, man.  Well, here's the apology.  Here it is.  Unbelievable.  Nice little stretch there.  Enjoy it while it's here.  Thank you, Nick.  Just want to say I misspoke during last night's newscast.  I apologize for my remarks to anyone who may have been offended.  All right.  And as we continue.  That sounded like a teaser for a news thing.  Yeah.  It didn't even sound like an apology.  Like, sometimes they almost sound sincere.  Again, he was handed that statement by management, 
[00:09:00]  management, and read it like it was on the teleprompter.  I'm certain that that scrolled down on the teleprompter.  He read it like he would any news story that pops out of that thing.  And away they went.  Why isn't this a big deal?  Well, it kind of got picked up in the papers, but not as a outrage.  Let's fire him.  FCC.  I think the change in administration helps. 
[00:09:30]  I think the bigger problems, things like the economy and everything.  When the FCC.  But I'm just talking about local, like, outrage and stuff.  Yeah.  But that all ties into, like, interest groups wanting to get their name mentioned,  their organization mentioned.  I think just too much shit is going on with the economy and this health care thing.  I think there's too much news that people are aware of that keeps this from being big.  Like, people are at the point now where it's like, that ain't a big deal. 
[00:10:00]  Who cares?  Who cares?  But during the height of the FCC fucking witch hunts?  Woo.  Gone.  That, uh, fucking.  Yeah.  That word fucking would cost a DJ, what, 300, what is it up to?  350,000?  Yeah, it's like $350,000.  Per station.  Yeah, per station.  So if we did that and we were on, what, about 10 or 12 stations the last time we were syndicated, I guess?  Yeah, you're talking millions.  Three million dollars.  Yeah.  Three million dollars.  The difference is it would have been said on purpose by the show and meant.  Of course.  And meant and repeated and then replayed. 
[00:10:30]  Anybody would look at Artie and ask this and just go, the guy didn't mean anything.  Because he really, my favorite part is his laugh at the after it.  Yeah.  It's just, ha, ha, ha, ha.  It just said, fuck, I don't care.  But most times the jock doesn't mean it.  You know what I mean?  I mean, like, ah, whatever.  He probably made a bet with someone.  Huh?  He probably made a drunk bet with somebody and was like, oh my god, this is a lot of money  I'm at risk.  I gotta say fuck now.  I bet, Ernie, Ernie, I bet you can't even say fuck on the air.  I bet you fucking, 10 grand you can't say fuck on the air. 
[00:11:00]  I, it's my fucking newscast.  I can say fuck, you watch me.  You watch me.  Yeah.  He's like, oh, fuck that chicken.  Shit.  Oh, fuck.  Gotta throw.  One more time.  Fox 5 Sky Guardian and then check that 7-8 to make your weekend plans.  Takes a tough man to make a tender forecast, Nick.  I guess that's me.  Keep fucking that chicken.  Okay, I'll do that.  All right, when we continue.  The best part is all right.  All right.  As we continue, we'll talk more about animal fucking. 
[00:11:30]  He has no clue.  He has the demeanor of a guy who has just backed over a person in the driveway and doesn't know  it.  Right.  Like, everyone's watching and they see little legs under the car tire and he's still smiling  and waving.  They're horrified.  He's like, take it easy.  I'll drop by again soon.  He's just a bloodied child under the rear wheel.  Just oblivious to everything around him.  Yes.  Yes.  That's exactly where I'm at with this.  Oh, Ernie. 
[00:12:00]  I love him.  Keep up the bad work, Ernie.  Kevin from Connecticut.  Keep up the bad work.  Kevin from Connecticut.  You keep fingering that infant.  Oh, shit.  Why, Kevin?  Just clueless.  Instead of chicken.  Exactly.  Keep it to animals.  He just fell apart after the first, you know what, just keep being small.  You're doing the right thing, dude.  Somebody was.  Apparently, people forgot that they got to ask me a follow-up question.  Yeah, but we don't even know what you were doing. 
[00:12:30]  Neither did I.  I needed a subject.  Yeah, we were.  I was trying to figure out what the subject was.  I'm so tired.  Like, fly fishing, dude.  Yeah, we needed some kind of subject.  And then it would have been like, well, do you tie your own flies?  Dad, dad, finger a chicken.  You got your cup of coffee, you fucking chicken.  Oh, dude.  You're standing there in nature.  The water's going dribble, dribble.  You got your cup of coffee.  You got your cigarette.  You know what, dude?  How long do you usually have to leave the line in before you catch something? 
[00:13:00]  Yeah, put your dick in a bird, dude.  Yeah, have fun fucking talking about fly fishing while I do it next.  I think it's next weekend or the week after that.  I was stunned when Kenny came in yesterday.  All right, yeah, I'll give everyone an update.  Bob Kelly, first of all, is calling me every day.  Of course, he's so excited.  And I'm not answering my phone.  And then he goes, dude, did you get your fishing license yet?  I'm like, what?  What?  I have to get a fucking fishing license to go fly fishing with Bob Kelly. 
[00:13:30]  In some fucking river in upstate New York.  Instead of this thing, instead of this just being a quick little thing where I jump in my car,  maybe Sunday morning, get up there, fucking fly fish for a few hours and come home.  It's a whole weekend.  The girls are involved.  Dogs are involved.  And now I have to get a fishing license.  How?  And I had to apply online.  I'm like, what are you doing?  This is too much work.  You just thought you're going to go up there, throw a line in the water a few times.  And that was, yeah.  Untangle my shit because I know I don't know what I'm doing. 
[00:14:00]  There better be uber amounts of video of this.  I want a documentary of this whole thing.  I'm bringing both flip cameras.  Yeah, yeah.  It's going to be a two-camera shoot in the woods.  Two-camera shoot, have a tripod set up.  I mean, really.  I'm going all out.  You need fucking assistant directors, cameramen.  I might have to bring someone to just film on the HD flip.  But it's like, now I've got to get a license?  Yeah.  It's not even a lot of money. 
[00:14:30]  It's just more of the hassles.  Well, that just goes to prove you're really not free to do anything.  I need your driver's license.  Why?  You've got to get your fishing license.  So what, if I couldn't drive, I couldn't fish?  Yeah.  Is that it?  Yeah, really.  What happens if I don't have one?  But you're right.  It just proves that you can't just do whatever you want.  You can't just drive and see a river and have a fishing pole and go, you know, I want to do some fishing.  It's America.  I'm free.  No, you know something?  You can fish when they tell you you can fish and where they tell you and with a license. 
[00:15:00]  Right.  So it's just, it's such an infringement.  Shouldn't you have like a...  Government's up your ass all the time.  But, you know, they're protecting the wildlife and the fish and stuff.  I'm for that to a certain extent, right?  Look, if some Japanese are coming over here and dredging our rivers with nets, there'd be a problem.  Maybe we can take care of that.  Oh, fuck are you making a great point.  But if one guy...  But Joe fucking Fisherman on Long Island on a Sunday wants to cast a few. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah, let's not fucking infringe on his freedoms.  Holy shit, I'm with you.  You know, there's not a trawler going up the river in fucking ass-cunt Louisiana.  Yeah, and you have to measure your fish?  Yeah, yeah.  No, I don't feel like measuring my fish.  This looks like a good size and I want to eat this fucking thing.  It's a little small, but maybe I'll catch another one and it'll be the size of a big fish and then I can eat.  You make a great point.  It's ridiculous.  They're hassling, you know, Joe Fishman and these fucking Japanese...  Trawlers are just raping the ocean of everything living in swaths of miles. 
[00:16:00]  Right.  They're just killing a million fucking porpoises and dolphins to get one tuna.  They don't get what they see in their way.  It doesn't matter.  A fucking mermaid would take a spear in the head from one of those guys.  They don't give a shit.  Yeah.  God, are you right?  You are so fucking right.  But the average little guy just wants to get out there, cast his line, have a little fun. 
[00:16:30]  License.  You can fish during this month and this.  You need this.  You're not alone.  And you know what?  In the end, it's not about protecting the fish.  It's a moneymaker.  It's a moneymaker.  The government sits around, whether it's, you know, the big guys down in Washington or locally.  Or local guys.  And they just figure out more ways to make money.  To make a little bit more cash off of your fucking back.  Right.  Like we were talking earlier, it came on the news, Suffolk County on Long Island, out here 
[00:17:00]  on Long Island, wants to quadruple, quadruple the hotel tax on Long Island, which is already  ridiculous.  When you get a hotel bill and you see all the taxes that you're paying, it's like your phone  bill.  We had talked about that in the past.  All the taxes.  Because it's so crazy to quadruple the tax.  For what?  For what?  Because you fucked up.  We have to pay.  Yeah.  And the county gets that money.  Yeah.  Maybe the hotel itself gets a tiny, tiny little taste.  Not at the tax. 
[00:17:30]  They don't, right?  No.  Okay.  I wasn't sure how that really works.  No.  So, it has nothing to do with the hotel.  The county is making money because you're staying in a hotel in that county.  It's a way to fuck.  How do they figure that fucking thing out and get it past us?  I'll tell you how.  Because they're not fucking residents.  It's a way to get money of people who aren't voting for them.  That's true.  So, people, no one will object to it because they're not taking it from me and you.  It's very good.  It's people.  It's such bullshit.  You're right.  It's disgusting.  But then when you go away somewhere.  It's bullshit.  You don't live there, so what are you going to do?  Complain about policy?  Are you there for a few days?  Are your company's paying? 
[00:18:00]  Yeah, I got you a cup of coffee.  That is what it is.  No, you're absolutely right.  They're not taxing their constituency.  But it's also fucked up because you look to get a hotel wherever you go.  Let's say it's, I don't know, $200 a night, $220 a night, whatever.  You're like, oh, wow, you know, we can afford this.  Yeah.  I'm talking as Joe fucking citizen.  Oh, $220, nice.  We're going to be there three days.  In New York.  Huh?  In New York.  Yeah.  And all of a sudden, you know, you get your bill and that $220 is now.  You know, you got the hotel tax. 
[00:18:30]  You got this tax.  You got the room, blah, blah, tax.  Room tax.  The next thing you're $220 a night is easily close to $300.  So why doesn't the hotel just tell you it's going to be eh?  Because they don't want you walking away going, I'm going to find a cheaper fucking hotel.  Well, you know, but they're misrepresenting how much that room actually is.  This is something that has always drove me nuts.  And the same thing with renting cars.  Oh, it's $100 a day.  Nice.  Yeah.  I want to be able to go after one day with a rental car with a crispy $100 bill and go, 
[00:19:00]  here you go, sir.  Right.  I've rented your car.  Oh, wait a minute.  Come back here.  See, there's this, this, this.  Right.  But it said $100 a day.  Right.  Well, that's for this.  Well, it's not $100 a day.  Then it's not $100.  You're a liar.  They're all liars.  I'm not lying.  I rented for $100 a day.  I'm not lying.  You are lying.  I'm not lying.  I know you're lying.  You lie.  Anyway, getting back to Ernie Anastas.  Maybe the people forgot about the clip, so we should play it again. 
[00:19:30]  Oh, please.  I love that.  Like Jimmy said, the best part really is the laughing.  It's the post-fuck shenanigans that goes on.  My favorite part about this whole thing, it just proves my point that they're just news readers  and they don't pay attention to each other.  Nope.  They barely know what they're doing.  Yeah, they just read what's strolling past them.  So this guy's saying fucking and the weather guy is just laughing along like, well, I'll  do that because he really didn't even really hear it.  Yeah, he's just like, oh, that's a joke, I guess. 
[00:20:00]  And he listens back later going, did I say I'll do that to fucking a chicken?  And the woman newsreader, she's the only one aware of her surroundings.  She's kind of shocked.  He's saying fucking.  He's reacting and laughing.  He's laughing.  What are they laughing about?  We're on the air, dummy.  Fox 5 Sky Guardian and then check that Saturday to make your weekend plans.  Takes a tough man to make a tender forecast, Nick.  I guess that's me.  Keep fucking that chicken.  Okay, I'll do that.  All right, when we continue.  All right, I'll do that.  You sure will. 
[00:20:30]  All right.  All right, you cunt.  Good gravy.  Imagine he just goes off.  Completely go off.  Anyway, there's articles in all the papers and we've been dragged into the Ernie Anastas controversy.  Of course.  Any media controversy, they'll figure out a way to weave us into the hijinks.  Well, we're one of the examples of people cursing on the air live as far as news readers go. 
[00:21:00]  Absolutely.  It's the famous Arthur Cheyenne one.  Of course.  Who's back working, by the way.  Is that 05 that happened in 2005?  I think it's when we first came back.  Nathaniel was...  Maybe 05, early 05, I'm thinking.  Nathaniel.  So what?  We were doing our little assault on the media thing and Arthur Cheyenne was doing a story  from the top of a subway platform or whatever.  The top of the subway stairs, whatever.  And good old Than and actually one of Howard's guys just happened to be walking by. 
[00:21:30]  Yeah, crazy cabbie.  And it just had a dumb sign that's...  I forgot what the sign said.  The sign just said something like O&A and XM Satellite Radio, shit like that.  And he held it behind Arthur Cheyenne, which, you know, it was pretty innocent at that point.  But then I guess crazy cabbie was walking up, saw it, realized we were doing that kind of thing at the time,  and started saying, mouthing off and being loud behind Arthur Cheyenne. 
[00:22:00]  And then Arthur Cheyenne was going to some taped piece that had to do with his story.  But he went like, all right, let's go to the tape.  And he was like, let's go to the tape.  What the fuck are you doing?  Like, he didn't leave any time where sometimes the reporter's looking at the camera all awkwardly  because they don't have the tape ready immediately.  They're not sure if they're still on.  Yeah.  He didn't take that breath.  Well, they set up those live shots all the time with a little monitor.  Yeah.  So if he says, let's go to this tape piece, whatever, he would see that the tape piece is starting, realizing he's not on anymore. 
[00:22:30]  Now he's clear.  I think his opportunity would be to turn around and curse out Than and Crazy Cabby.  But he jumped the gun on that one, didn't he?  Good morning, Sean.  This is apparently a very simple crime to commit.  All one has to do is buy multiple MetroCard, stand at the turnstile, and just continuously swipe people in all day.  Police sources say these guys net a couple hundred dollars a day, and that's pure profit.  But it's costing the TA a great deal, about $16 million a year, and they're trying to put a stop to it. 
[00:23:00]  What the fuck is your problem, man?  Trying to put a stop to it.  What the fuck is your problem, man?  Yeah, that was Dan going, Opie and Anthony, XM Silent Radio, and then Crazy Cabby yelled, suck!  Yeah.  Yeah, because we suck, right?  Yeah.  We suck.  And then Arthur had to turn immediately around and drop the F-bomb.  Idiot.  And, yeah, he got the boot for that.  And if you ask me, that's a little more innocent than what Ernie did. 
[00:23:30]  Hell, yeah.  Yeah.  We're getting more info.  Keep up the bout work.  We're getting more info.  I can't get that out of my head every time I hear Ernie now.  What, Scarface's joke?  Yeah.  Fucking Tony Montana's idea of a fun joke.  Tony Montana's fun joke.  Either killing a fucking communist, or making fun of Ernie.  Yeah.  Keep up the bout work.  He's either cutting Rebenga's stomach out, or just instead of saying good, he said bad.  He thinks he's a fucking cut-up.  He's hysterical.  I like Omar five minutes later. 
[00:24:00]  I never trust him.  I never trust him.  He's pointing up where Omar used to be, hanging.  The helicopter left like a half hour ago.  He still goes, I didn't like him.  It's a different day.  It's raining.  He has a beard.  Oh, God.  What are you pointing at?  You're mad at that cumulus cloud, Tony.  Let's say hi to Scott, because Ernie has done some other things on live TV.  Has he?  Ernie Nastus info from Scott.  Yes, Scott.  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Hey, squad.  Just checking in. 
[00:24:30]  If you YouTube Ernie Nastus also, there's another instance where he gets all fumbled up in his words,  and it's .fox.cock.  Oh, really?  Oh, really?  He says cock, which, oddly enough, is another word for a rooster, I believe.  Yeah, sure.  He loves the fowl.  He's obsessed with fowl, because he is fowl.  He loves poultry.  He's fowl.  He's fowl.  He's fowl mouth.  They're spelled differently.  I said the same thing.  Oh, literal spelling, Jimmy. 
[00:25:00]  Well, very good.  Oh, is that it?  We need a little volume on that?  Let's get this one.  All right.  The Shea Stadium auction is up and running right now, and here's the story.  The Mets fans are bidding up a storm.  Everything from turnstiles to menu.  Tell me to get it down the hall.  It's a really long clip.  Yeah.  Because in the meantime, we got a whole bunch of TV newsreaders cursing.  Ah.  I mean, a whole bunch.  Christ on a pony, do I love these. 
[00:25:30]  Look at us right out of the box giving these fuckers material.  Come on.  We start with CNN.  Kyra Phillips.  Kyra Phillips.  You've seen her.  Uh-huh.  Roland Martin.  Well, I don't know.  I'm going to go favorite there.  CNN political analyst.  You know you love me, Kyra.  At least Leslie Sanchez, Republican strategist and CNN political cunt contributor, is always  on time.  Sorry, Leslie.  I ran here.  I ran here.  A good man is worth the wait. 
[00:26:00]  Oh, Lord.  See?  See?  Okay, Leslie.  Okay, I'm not taking sides here.  Holy shit.  Holy shit.  Cunt.  Cunt.  Cunt.  Cunt.  Cunt.  A double.  Double.  She hit her with.  A double C.  Mm-hmm.  And then Shepard Smith.  Oh, my God.  Shep is a filthy mouth.  He's got a bunch of them.  Shep is just a dirty mouth.  We got two of my favorites from Shepard Smith from Fox News.  J-Lo's new song, Jenny from the Block, all about Lopez Roots, about how she's still  a neighborhood gal at heart. 
[00:26:30]  But folks from that street in New York, the Bronx section, sound more likely to give her  a curb job than a blowjob or block party.  The New York Post.  We're sorry about that slip up there.  I have no idea how that happened.  But it won't happen again.  And that's your news.  Than a blowjob.  Holy shit.  Did I say blowjob?  I kind of like Shepard Smith.  I don't know why.  He's goofy.  Didn't he run over people, too?  He's just a mess.  Yeah, apparently he was arguing with a female reporter over a parking space. 
[00:27:00]  And she was holding a parking space for, I guess, one of the news fans.  It was one of those stories.  So a bunch of news people were converging on one spot.  And it was a good parking space.  So she's standing there.  And Shep wanted to pull in.  And she wouldn't move.  So we kept edging the car forward until he, like, hit her knee or something.  And he wound up getting arrested for assault.  Yeah.  Bless you, Danny.  Are you still sick?  What are you doing back at work if you're still sick? 
[00:27:30]  Aw, shit.  I can't.  Every day I have one really intense sneezing fit.  Yeah.  And I think that was just it for today.  Sounds to me like it's a real case of a kid who's allergic to work.  I mean, if you're suggesting I should take the rest of the day off, then I mean, maybe.  Well.  I think you should.  I think, man.  You know what?  I don't want to complain.  It's not a bad idea.  I like when you guys get to take a day off.  If you're a little drowsy and you need somebody to drive you home, I'm willing to take on that duty.  All right, guys.  Keep fucking that chicken, Danny. 
[00:28:00]  That's right.  Well, actually, more worm at the bottle of the tequila bottle.  Oh, Dan, don't be fresh.  Don't be fresh.  You know what, dude?  You hold the chicken, the feathers are flopping.  You know what, dude?  You fuck it, it chirps.  He probably has that fucking course.  He has a son of a bitch.  Shepard Smith with another one here.  They genuinely believe is going to uncover tens of millions of dollars in health care fraud. 
[00:28:30]  Wow.  Jonathan Cunt live in our Southern California newsroom.  He was once right.  Of this Thursday, August the 7th, 2008.  Did you see Jonathan Hunt's report earlier in this newscast?  The producer in the booth behind me is Jonathan Glenn.  So I was talking to Jonathan Glenn, and then I was about to thank Jonathan Hunt, and I said, Jonathan...  You get it.  At least he addressed it.  I like how he addressed it.  He goes through the thought process, at least, and tells you, like, how that happened.  Sure.  So it was Jonathan Gunt with a G. 
[00:29:00]  I don't know how you get a hard G.  It's like...  A hard C, though.  Yeah.  You think you could do that?  I don't know.  That is a rough one, but, eh, you know.  I think he was just thinking of Mike Hunt.  Yes, yes.  Oh, yeah.  This is a fave of a lot of people from MSNBC.  Continuing to follow the latest developments in the crash of Delta Flight 5191.  49 people killed.  Here's a Blackhawk helicopter surveying the scene. 
[00:29:30]  We know the NTSB...  Oh, what's on her mind?  No kidding.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Speaking of Blackhawk...  A Blackhawk helicopter.  Wow.  That's a good one.  You hear about that story at Hofstra?  Oh.  That's just a Tuesday night for me.  Oh, Samantha.  You are fucking wild.  Oh, she just loves getting fucked. 
[00:30:00]  Come on, Samantha.  Shut up.  There it is.  A Blackhawk.  Oh, ho, ho, ho.  There's a gangbang at Hofstra University.  I wish they'd helicopter in some Blackhawk for me.  Some Blackhawk for me.  Oh, oh, oh.  That's just an average launch for me.  Get it?  Oh, Samantha.  And the girls are all like, oh, gosh, is she the loose cannon?  Speaking of cannon, this Blackhawk was about the size of one. 
[00:30:30]  But I took it all right down to the balls.  Oh, Samantha.  Oh, Samantha, you.  You're crazy.  Keep fucking that chicken, Samantha.  Ah, okay.  I left the oven mitts duct taped to my dog's paws.  How embarrassing.  Hey, we need our music, man.  Thank you.  Yes.  I duct taped the oven mitts to my dog's paws so as not to scratch my tender elderly skin. 
[00:31:00]  Oh, Samantha.  But what a fucking my Labrador gave me.  Oh, Samantha, you're insanely crazy.  You mean to tell me you let your dog fuck you?  Why, who doesn't, honey?  Don't knock it till you've tried it.  Oh, Samantha.  Give us all another Cosmo.  Are you trying to tell us that you like cog?  I love the cog.  Oh, Samantha. 
[00:31:30]  She's crazy.  Can't wait for the next movie.  Can't wait.  Nothing but Samantha sitting on a huge cock.  Who's fucking that?  Stop it.  All right, here's another newsreader fucking up.  Oh, we all know this newsreader.  One of the greatest newsreaders of all time.  He still was just a newsreader, though.  Who is he?  The key component, and what the president insists, is a job stimulus program.  Ohio, a strong Republican state, is hurting economically. 
[00:32:00]  And as NBC David Gregory reports tonight, the president took his message right to a powerful  Ohio Republican who is not convinced the tax cunts are the answer.  No, tax cunts are never the answer.  You really took it to a very hot little Ohio.  Boy, I sure hope they don't tax my cunts.  Oh, Samantha.  Wow, what a tax that would be.  Imagine that.  That's a lot of real estate, you know, because you're huge. 
[00:32:30]  With all the cock my cunt has had, the taxes would be outrageous.  They better not tax.  Although it would get rid of the deficit.  Speaking of a stimulus package.  Oh, Samantha, you're talking about your pussy being a stimulus package that should be taxed?  Oh, you're crazy.  Tax cunts.  Oh, Samantha.  She's wild.  She's wild. 
[00:33:00]  Do you think she's crazy?  Crazy.  That girl is crazy.  Tax cunts.  Not sure that the president has those tax cunts.  Rem running out of air.  Took it to a powerful Ohio politician.  The president to find out his tax cunts.  I'm Brokaw, NBC Nightly News.  Top story tonight.  Will the president start taxing cunts?  We're going to be walking into this to see if the president indeed will be taxing cunts. 
[00:33:30]  By the way, keep fucking that chicken.  Ernie, back to you.  The next one.  Boy, do they fuck up a lot.  We got 16 of these.  We're going to have to break it in half.  Yeah.  We're going to play a couple more, then we're going to break, and then we're going to do more of the newsreaders fucking up. 
[00:34:00]  See, this is why you get your live programming.  Look at us.  Look at us.  Big story.  We're right on top of it.  But, you know, do we want to be home?  Sure.  Of course we do.  But we're here.  What's the other guy doing?  Rerunning a Jessica Hahn interview from fucking 1990?  Not a clue.  We are your workhorses.  Don't you forget it.  Speaking of whores.  Oh, Samantha.  What are you saying now?  The guy I was with last night put a horse to shame with the size of his cock. 
[00:34:30]  My favorite part is another round of Cosmos for the girl.  Yeah.  Another round of Cosmos.  And one for my pussy, too.  It's going to drink a Cosmo.  God, you could summarize those movies very simply.  Samantha taking a lot of cock, and the girls go and buy shoes.  Yeah.  They buy shoes and go like, oh, Samantha.  Right.  And they, you know, their relationships are very complicated.  So that's their storyline. 
[00:35:00]  It's like, oh, my God.  Carrie is going out with this guy, but is she in love?  And does he love her?  And is he the perfect man?  And Samantha's just like, stick it right in my ass.  She keeps it simple.  She just rotates holes.  That's all.  Let me see.  What day is it?  It's an ass day.  I still can't sit down, so just mouth fuck me.  Yes.  Fuck my mouth.  It's a Tuesday.  And then, of course, tomorrow I'll use my pussy again.  And then Friday's all about my bunghole. 
[00:35:30]  Oh, Samantha, you don't have days for your fucking holes, do you?  I certainly do.  And the hands are always available for a double jack-off.  Oh, Samantha.  Boy, she's just crazy.  Helps work out my hands to hold on to those Cosmos.  Oh, God.  Big bukkake session.  What a slob.  Fuck.  All right, back to the newsreaders screwing up. 
[00:36:00]  We got WPIX here in New York.  That's Channel 11, right?  Picks.  This one is great.  This could be the best one right here.  Really?  Yeah.  Which one is the best so far?  The Black Cox helicopter or the Tax Cunts?  I like any time a woman is saying Cox.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  That's a good one.  Listen to this one.  We're live along Route 23 here in Pompton Plains, where the snow has been coming down at a fairly  steady clip for about an hour and a half now. 
[00:36:30]  I'd say there's about an inch, an inch and a half on the ground you can see right here.  Maybe even a little more than two inches.  But take a look over here on the roadway.  Just in the last half hour or so, the flakes have begun to stick a little bit on the asshole.  Ass-fault.  Now, if you...  That potato flake sticking to your asshole.  But what?  He wasn't even...  He wasn't even close there.  Flakes sticking to the asshole.  Oh, asphalt.  All right.  That is great. 
[00:37:00]  Fuck.  All right.  Ass-fault.  I never heard that one.  Yeah, that's...  That's just...  That has to be played again.  Just the end.  Oh, yeah.  We're live along Route 20.  Play the end for everybody.  That is fantastic.  If I can figure this out.  He just described weather for Fez.  Two inches.  But take a look over here on the roadway.  Just in the last half hour or so, the flakes have begun to stick a little bit on the asshole.  Ass-fault.  Now, if you...  Ass-fault.  Ass-fault.  Yeah, it has a fault. 
[00:37:30]  All right.  Hey, Samantha, have you ever had a snowflake stick to your asshole?  I've had a lot.  I remember in college, I had a lot of flakes in my asshole.  You know, geeks.  Do you get it?  Flakes.  Yeah, we do.  A lot of weird guys.  Flakes in my asshole.  Oh, oh, oh.  All right, Samantha.  We get it.  What about potato flakes?  Potato flakes.  Potato flakes.  A lot of flakes on the asphalt.  I'm a asphalt.  I was fucked on the asphalt in the asshole.  Coincidentally enough. 
[00:38:00]  Oh, Samantha.  Oh, gosh.  You gonna buy some shoes?  You can fill...  Yes, the last ones I had are full of cum.  It dripped right down out of my pussy into my shoes.  You could fill my pothole anytime.  Oh, that's Samantha.  With black asphalt.  With black guy cum.  Just shovel it in.  There's enough room.  Enough room for everyone.  Oh, oh.  Oh, Samantha.  Are we the only two enjoying this? 
[00:38:30]  I don't know.  I have no fucking idea.  I'm just so sick of her and her love of cock.  We get it.  Right to the grave.  There might be a twist in this movie where maybe she really falls in love and tries to  give up cock for a week.  How about she gets fucking chlamydia?  At the very least.  Chlamydia.  I have chlamydia, girls.  But it hasn't stopped me.  It hasn't stopped me.  I'm still fucking like a mad woman. 
[00:39:00]  Spread the chlamydia, I say.  They now call me the queen of the jerk.  Doesn't a Cosmo fix that?  I'm gonna do a handstand.  Just pour it right down the old fucking fuck flu.  What?  Jesus.  What is Sarah Jessica Parker doing this whole time?  Just going, oh, Samantha.  And then she's contemplating and thinking aloud about if the guy she's with really loves 
[00:39:30]  her.  While Samantha fucking does a headstand and her friend checks her.  She's got a dipstick in her pussy.  She's down a little on jizz.  She's down a quart.  Dipstick.  How degraded.  Fucking jizz and dipstick.  Yeah, but for the friend to go along with it is the best part.  That's of course.  And she's got to wipe the first thing off and then stick it back in and get an accurate  reading. 
[00:40:00]  Dave is a gay guy.  Is he?  The only reason, we don't like pointing that shit out unless it's important to what we're  talking about.  It's okay.  It's not my real name.  Dave, what do you got, buddy?  I'm just listening, man.  Dave.  I think it's one of these dirty cunts on Sex and the City, right?  I swear to fuck, I ain't never ever seen the episode and never watched the movie.  Yeah, but you got to know a little bit about Sex and the City.  No, I don't.  I swear to fuck, I don't. 
[00:40:30]  All right.  Well, Samantha is like one of the girls.  There's four of them.  Yeah.  And she just has sex all the time.  And then they sit around during lunch and she just talks about the guy she fucked the  night before.  And poor Carrie just sits around trying to find the perfect man and looking in the mirror  as fucking...  Okay, now...  She looks like a picture of Dorian Gray.  Yeah, Carrie wants to fall in love so badly, but she can't get over the fact that her uncle  touched her when she was eight. 
[00:41:00]  There's something going on there that's preventing her from falling in love.  Then you got the stupid prude, the only one you do want to see naked, not taking her clothes  off.  Yeah, yeah.  And then you got the angry redhead.  Boy, there's a big stretch.  A redhead that's angry.  Wow.  That's crazy.  See, that's basic knowledge, though.  I don't think you have to watch the show to know that.  I'll be honest.  I watched it.  I've never watched one episode.  I'll tell you why I watched it.  Because that stupid PD of ours...  Actually, he's all right.  Boy, you sure... 
[00:41:30]  I have no idea which one you're talking about.  That's how many we've had.  Gary Wall walked in when we starred at WNEW.  Hey, guys.  And I never heard of this show whatsoever.  And he goes, you got to watch this Sex and the City.  It's just an amazing show.  What?  And I didn't know it was a chick show or nothing.  I mean, the name itself is like Sex and the City.  That sounds like it could be...  It has potential.  Sounds like one of those HBO behind-the-scenes things.  Right.  But, you know, like a Californication or something.  Yeah.  But it's called Sex and the City. 
[00:42:00]  He goes, it would be really good for you guys if you watched that show.  Because it's the whole landscape of Manhattan.  You would really get a...  Oh, is it?  You'd get a real good feel.  Nice realistic depiction.  Yeah, for Manhattan.  Yeah.  And, of course, you know, our radio show is being heard all over Manhattan.  Mm-hmm.  So I watched it a few times.  I was like, fuck.  This sucks.  This guy likes chick shows.  Think he's a fruit.  And then I got obsessed with the fact that Samantha likes Cox so much that I had to see the next scenario of... 
[00:42:30]  Can we get some of those lines from Samantha talking about all the fucking guys she banged?  Yeah, grab some Samantha fuck-me lines.  For Sam and E-Rock down the hall, a montage of Samantha talking about cock.  Just one after another.  Boom, boom, boom, boom.  Her little innuendos and fucking...  Double entendres.  ...how she fucked the night before.  And the girls just, oh, that's Samantha.  Right.  All right.  Here we go.  All right.  More newsreaders cursing.  Rosanna Scotto. 
[00:43:00]  Wow, really?  She dropped one?  A partner on the news.  This is what she said.  A little slip up here.  A mother in Texas is apologizing for lying that her husband died in Iraq to get tickets to a Hannah Montana concert.  Grand prize was a makeover, tickets, and airfare to go to a sold-out concert in New York.  The girls' essay was the winner until contest organizers found out...  You know, you interrupted that clip, but it made it sound like you fucked her up. 
[00:43:30]  Did you notice how well that worked?  I tripped her up.  New York.  The girls' essay was the winner until contest organizers found out it was all a lie.  Contest.  Mm-hmm.  One more before the break?  Please.  I would gladly hear another.  Oh, well, Anthony, we got Samantha from Sex and the City checking in.  Really?  Yes, we do.  Samantha, welcome to the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:44:00]  I hope we weren't too harsh.  Yeah.  Yeah, this is Samantha.  Two in the pink, one in the stink.  That's all I got to say about it.  Jesus.  Samantha feeds herself peanuts with her prolapsed asshole.  I just love the thought of that.  She's sitting there holding a Cosmo with her prolapsed asshole at the table.  Just kind of using her hands as she talks.  And then this big, nasty, fucking snuffleupagus, pink, wet asshole that's been turned inside 
[00:44:30]  out from a night of fucking just tips the glass up to her mouth.  And they're just like, Samantha, are you drinking with your asshole again?  Like a Star Wars cantina monster.  Danny found a YouTube clip.  It says, funny Samantha quotes.  Let's at least give it a try.  The guys down the hall are working, you know, to really make it smoke on the air.  But let's see what this, see if this works.  It is so refreshing to be with someone who likes to fuck outside the box. 
[00:45:00]  And this is my friend, Samantha.  Samantha Jones, 3M.  I'm for it.  You're right under me.  Well, that sounds promising.  Oh.  Oh.  Ma'am, can you undo your cuff so we can use ours?  Surely.  All the good ones are getting arrested.  Fuck me badly once, shame on you. 
[00:45:30]  Fuck me badly twice, shame on me.  I'm serious.  It's all gotten so sanitary.  I mean, no smoking in bars.  What's next?  No fucking in bars?  For that hot wait or something wrong.  I'm sleeping with him tonight.  But he doesn't know it yet.  So he's doing a fuck you to the ex.  As long as he keeps fucking you, what's the problem?  I'm sorry I can't.  Don't hate me.  The motherfucker's concise.  Hi, I need something that will make a guy come in his pants as soon as he seeks me.  Ugh.  Oh, another girl? 
[00:46:00]  How about a facelift?  Oh, God.  There goes my heart on.  I'm so sick of these people with their children.  I'm telling you, they're everywhere.  Well, I've made my point, and he's made this.  I believe we don't get to spend the last night together.  Are you dying?  Men are crazy.  I fucked that waiter at the party, and he got fired for it.  So I gave him $300 the next time we fucked, and now I think he's upset.  Get down. 
[00:46:30]  Get down.  This is exactly what we're talking about.  Yeah, yes.  We got this perfect.  I haven't watched enough of this to know this.  No.  Hey, Smith.  Want to come over and do me?  That motherfucker fuck shit.  There's a shit motherfucker fuck shit situation?  I have to go to the theater.  They finally made that mandatory.  I'll have the fruit plate, and I'm back with Richard.  Oh, I think that's sweet.  It's not sweet.  It's pathetic how far a gal will go for a good fuck. 
[00:47:00]  Oh, God.  It's exactly...  Very few women can pull off anger in a tube stock.  My God.  I've been thinking.  Our pathetic relationship is as close to marriage as either one of us ever hopes to get.  So I feel I deserve some sort of settlement.  Like, say, a weekend at your house in the Hamptons?  You're not invited.  I'll be having a party.  You're not invited to that either.  Oh, it's Samantha.  Call me.  I'm jealous.  I'm just dying to look like this.  I guess I went a little crazy being at Richard's house around this party-crashing pussy-pussy. 
[00:47:30]  Every time I get high, you say you don't want to come down.  You say it's enough.  In fact, I'm still too much.  Every time I want to get down.  Get down.  Get down.  Make a load.  That is...  That's exactly what we do.  She just sits there.  A lot of that dialogue was done in front of the girls.  Right.  And, of course, it's just Samantha quotes, so you don't get to hear the repartee from the other girls. 
[00:48:00]  But I'm sure it was like, oh, that's Samantha.  Oh, boy.  She loves dick.  She's just getting...  She has to have AIDS.  Samantha, where are you?  I'm calling from inside of my own pussy.  It's amazing.  Right.  I was able to actually get in here.  That was awful, those clips.  I know.  I know it's hard out of context, but I didn't like her fucking stagey acting.  Yeah.  No, it's...  Wow.  They're going to make another blockbuster movie.  They're in the middle of it. 
[00:48:30]  Yeah.  They're shutting down Manhattan.  We got caught in the Sex and the City movie making traffic yesterday.  The old hag.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  We saw.  I mean...  You lying old hag.  You lying old hag.  I give it to squealers right in the belly.  Well, how about the asshole, too?  That just made me mad.  We were having fun with it, but to actually hear it for real?  Yeah.  One more.  I have a question.  Either one of you guys after the show want to go see Love Happens?  Oh, God.  That looks so funny. 
[00:49:00]  Right?  That's the movie I got in.  Oh, oh, oh.  Jennifer Aniston.  Speaking of...  You know, she...  What is the catchphrase of the movie there?  Above the...  Sometimes when you least expect it, dot, dot, dot.  Love Happens.  Aw.  That's so sweet.  Yeah, it looks good.  He's a self-help guy who's got so many problems himself.  You know, it's ironic because he's, like, writes self-help books and he has problems.  And then she has problems finding men because they are all just bastards.  She's looking for love and these guys are just idiots. 
[00:49:30]  And finally, love happens between these two people that you normally wouldn't think would  get together.  And I'm sure at the beginning they don't.  They probably have a problem with each other.  Yeah, yeah.  And there's, like, snarky little remarks to each other.  And then slowly they realize, wow, we really have a lot in common.  And they're forced maybe to go out and be with each other or one of them finally says,  okay.  Maybe this one won't be predictable.  Maybe there'll be, like, a little twist ending. 
[00:50:00]  Really?  Yeah.  Like, he chops her up and puts her in a 55-gallon drub on the side of the Taconic.  Or the twist will be that they actually meet when she's at the doctor because her clit  ring got infected.  And so she has to have an alcohol swab.  And he's in the waiting room with gout.  With gout.  I'm just hoping that she has smelly pussy disease.  And he's really in love, but he's like, oh, fuck, I gotta deal with this smelly pussy disease.  Finally, yeah, the romantic music plays.  And it's like, doo-doo-doo. 
[00:50:30]  And they're, like, in bed rolling around.  And he starts going down.  And they do that PG thing where he kind of goes down.  And then you hear, like, bang, bang, bang.  Like the piano gets all fucked up.  And he just stands up like, oof.  And then another scene, she rides his bike and comes back.  And then they pan to outside the building.  And you hear a crash as he throws his own bike through the window because the seat is ruined.  Is that the TMZ kid?  Look at that.  Hey.  Wow.  TMZ Mike making his first appearance. 
[00:51:00]  Mike.  At the new joint.  Nice seeing Mike, as always.  Here's one more newsreader fucking up.  Sue Simmons.  This was a biggie.  Sue Simmons, yes.  I remember that.  There was rumors that she might have been a little tipsy.  Yes.  There's rumors that she likes to throw back a few in between newscasts.  Yeah, because these newscasters, they got to do a lot of times the morning.  And then they do the evening news.  And then they come on for the 11 o'clock news.  So there's a lot of downtime.  Right.  And unfortunately, I think what happens is a lot of these newscasters spend this off time in the bars. 
[00:51:30]  At 11, pay more at the grocer, but getting less.  We'll tell you how to get the most.  The fuck are you doing?  Oh, God damn.  Was that good?  Oh, man.  That was.  Did she say pluck?  I don't know if that was actually fucked.  Why aren't some of these people getting fired?  Like I said, we can't be hypocrites and call for their firings. 
[00:52:00]  But if radio guys are getting fired for things that are nowhere near this.  Imagine being on the air.  Some of these people should be fired.  On terrestrial radio and yelling, what the fuck are you doing?  Right.  You'd be off.  We hear that one again.  That was a fucking gem.  Yeah, Sue Simmons.  She's a legend.  She's been doing her news reading in New York for a very long time.  Megan Fox?  Digging her.  Yeah.  Now, going back to your point you made yesterday. 
[00:52:30]  Yes, sir.  Sex and the City with Megan Fox and some of these other real hot broads.  Hot girls.  Now I think you bring in the male audience just a little bit.  Dude.  A little bit.  I think a little bit.  If Megan Fox was doing all those Samantha lines we just heard.  Megan Fox.  We would be making commsies in our pants.  That would be so hot.  Some of those scenes where like she's laying in bed.  And handcuffs and whipped cream.  Now that's hot.  Right.  Not some fucking lion old hag. 
[00:53:00]  With a mole that's getting a little too out of control.  Oh, stop.  The mole thing is sexy until that 30, I think.  Yeah.  I think 30, you have to go to the dermatologist and whatever they need to do to fucking take that off.  Get rid of it.  It's actually a very easy procedure.  Yes?  Is it?  Mm-hmm.  Tell that to the girls with the fucking moles.  What's her name?  Fucking Crawford.  Well, she's known for the moles.  So she's stuck with it.  Cindy Crawford. 
[00:53:30]  She's not stuck with it.  I think she'd get more publicity by saying she finally had it removed.  You know what?  Like hairs coming out of it.  That would be headline news.  Yeah.  She could sell it on eBay.  Imagine having her mole just in a little jewelry box.  In a little like contact case.  Yeah.  Contact case.  You put it on display.  Yeah.  Cindy Crawford's mole.  Fuck.  Let's start a rumor that that's what's going on.  Could we Google bomb?  Google bomb.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:54:00]  What is it?  The media is so stupid they would actually pick this one up.  Yeah.  It was a good one.  Cindy Crawford.  Cindy Crawford to sell mole.  What, Danny?  Whoa, no, whoa.  I like that.  I like that one.  Yeah.  What do you got, Danny?  What about just Cindy Crawford mole sale?  No, I like to sell mole.  Okay.  Cindy Crawford to sell mole.  Google that.  Yes. 
[00:54:30]  Google bomb that.  Google bomb Cindy Crawford to sell mole.  Oh, yeah.  That's a good one.  What the hell is that?  Oh, fuck.  Let's do it.  You know what?  Let's Twitter that, too.  OP Radio on Twitter.  Baby in there.  Let's retweet the fuck out of this.  Who's that?  Olivia Wilde.  Olivia Wilde?  Wow.  Holy mother of Jesus.  Oh, my God.  If she was in Sex and the City?  Yeah, I would go to see Sex and the City.  See another picture of her. 
[00:55:00]  Holy fuck.  Breaking news.  Look at me tweeting live in the air.  Breaking news.  These girls.  Dash.  Dash.  After breaking news.  Oh.  What is it in?  Cindy Crawford.  Cindy Crawford.  To sell mole.  To sell mole.  I should add more, or no, or keep it like that.  I kind of like that one.  And that's it?  Yeah.  Cindy Crawford to sell mole.  Okay.  If you're following me, retweet the shit out of this today, please. 
[00:55:30]  I don't ask much from you followers.  Oh, I thought you were going to call them fuckers.  I overuse that.  Yeah.  I know what my crutches are.  You don't have to tell me.  I work on them all the time.  Crutch.  Here's Sue Simmons one more time.  At 11, pay more at the grocer, but getting less.  We'll tell you how to get the most.  The fuck are you doing?  Guy was probably taking her drink away.  Who the fuck are you doing?  She was able to save her job because that's supposed to be recorded, I think. 
[00:56:00]  Or she thought it was being recorded.  Yeah, she thought it was a recorded piece.  So she was done, and somebody obviously was annoying her.  So she turned and going, what the fuck are you doing?  So that was her defense anyway.  All right, listen, that was eight.  We got another eight of these that we're going to do after the break.  And then someone wrote...  Eight down, eight to go is how we should say it.  That's right.  Am I listening to the manhole station?  Well, funny you should say that.  We have a brand new manhole promo.  That's a boy's...  Can we hear the first one, Travis, just to bring it all together? 
[00:56:30]  Do you have it, or do I have it?  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  You got it, Travis?  Eh.  Eh.  You know, Travis, just go to break with it when you have it.  That's what we'll do.  Go to break.  This is the original manhole promo.  This is a channel we would love to see on SiriusXM.  And sometime after the break, we'll play the second installment of the manhole channel.  Yes.  We'll find out what is being played on the manhole channel today.  Okay?  Opie and Anthony, Jim Norton. 
[00:57:00]  Jimmy Hartford again?  Oh, yes.  Tonight, the Funny Bone in Hartford.  Let me just give the number.  Thanks, man.  860-432-8600.  Tonight, tomorrow.  The new extreme guy talk channel for guys by women.  It's the manhole.  All whole.  All the time.  Forget what you've heard.  All girl is funny.  Like the morning crew.  Debbie and Susan with Twat Talk.  Did you see Lesnar's tibia tear through his leg last night on the UFC fight?  Yeah, that was cool. 
[00:57:30]  But wouldn't it have been better to just talk out their problems?  Yeah, you're right.  They probably have a lot in common.  Stay tuned for middays.  Alice and Betsy give their take on what guys are talking about on Chatter Cunts.  Do you think Mitch Hedberg could have been the next Bill Hicks?  Who's Bill Hicks?  A comedian.  You know, like Margaret Cho.  Oh, that sounds funny.  Then, listen to Rita and Lawanda in the Labial Lounge as they get down with today's hottest porn stars.  Hey, guys.  So, we have Taya Parker in today. 
[00:58:00]  Ooh.  What do you want to do with her?  We should find out what kind of clothes porn stars wear.  Oh.  I hope she's wearing underwear today.  Then, end your days right with the night crew.  Beatrice and Wanda on Clit Commandos.  And watch out.  You never know when Roy might stop by the studio for wacky shenanigans.  Have you ever parked in a handicapped spot without a sticker?  Yeah.  I did once.  I felt like such an outlaw.  Will you two whores shut the fuck up and suck my dick? 
[00:58:30]  Oh, Roy.  Oh, I know why you're playing this today, Travis.  You're not going to get one by me, my friend.  Anyone else want to know why he's playing Jimi Hendrix?  Why?  Jimi Hendrix is going to be doing a performance here. 
[00:59:00]  Is that it?  You're right, Jimi.  They dug him up.  Did I tell you that when I was a teenager?  I thought it would be cool if I changed my spelling of my name to J-I-M-I.  No, you didn't.  I did.  All right.  No.  I did.  I didn't do it, of course.  But I thought that would be cool.  You shouldn't have a last name, though.  I love how Jimi can do it.  You should just be Jimi J-I-M-I.  Jimi can just pull a douche chill out of his pocket like so many nickels and dimes.  I really did. 
[00:59:30]  I thought I would change to J-I-M-I.  Why?  Gotta be my name.  D-I-C-K.  Anthony, it was 39 years ago today that we lost the great Jimi Hendrix.  39?  At the age of 27.  Everyone knows that magic age of 27.  Is that it?  With the rock stars.  Yeah.  He would have been, what, 66 years old if he was still alive.  Wow.  That's still not old.  No, but he would have been different.  He's been dead pretty much our whole lives, and if he was still alive, he would only be 66. 
[01:00:00]  I think he might have OD'd the next day.  Oh, good point.  If he was still alive, he would have OD'd, like, within a week.  And for you Boston fans, Boston, more than a feeling, released 33 years ago.  Oh, wow.  That's a third of a century.  33 years ago. 
[01:00:30]  Give me a little more than a feeling.  There you go.  That's fucking...  That's enough.  This is off the first album, right?  The big one.  Fuck yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Not a bad song on this record.  This was giant.  This album and Frampton Comes Alive, like, were huge at the same time.  Yeah.  As much.  Were they really?  Yeah.  I was just saying yeah for the hell of it.  I didn't know that.  I didn't much remember that.  But it's within a year or so, but they were both so big for so long that there was definitely  an overlap in popularity. 
[01:01:00]  God damn it.  I love this album.  Double E's, man.  Jimmy just spelt Jimmy Norton like Jimi Hendrix.  He had to see it in writing.  Looks good, doesn't it?  No.  More than a hibachi.  When you barbecue in your bedroom.  Oh, boy.  Stare at the ceiling. 
[01:01:30]  Fucking dry eyeballs.  Fucking met the guy.  He seemed like he had it together.  He did at that point.  Anthony sung with him.  Oh, it was fantastic.  He was a great guy.  Actually got to sing a Beatles song with him.  Which Beatles song you sang with him?  I forgot which one that was.  With Brad Delp.  I forgot.  Who died in his bedroom with a barbecue.  Jesus.  What a way to go.  Yeah.  Because everyone enjoys the smell of a barbecue.  I didn't realize it could kill you.  It's like, hmm.  That's good.  Was it suicide? 
[01:02:00]  Kingsford charcoal.  Oh, boy, was it.  He actually kept, he had signs all over his house because he didn't want to kill his  dogs or anyone else.  He's like, look, what's happening behind this door is not pretty.  You might want to call the cops.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  He did the right thing.  Made sure he didn't take anyone else out with him.  Did he put some of those nice wood chips on there?  What are those?  A little mesquite.  A little mesquite.  How did he die?  I want to kill myself with mesquite.  Do you think that's a painful death or do you just kind of fall asleep?  No.  Because that gas smell is awful.  Apparently, it's.  I think it just makes you a little woozy. 
[01:02:30]  It's carbon monoxide.  So you just kind of.  I think you breathe it in.  I think you breathe it in before it really starts falling in.  Yeah, yeah.  Do you?  I don't know.  Like, if you sat in a room and just breathed it in, would you all of a sudden feel light  headed and get out of there or would you just fall asleep?  No, I think you wouldn't even know.  You'd just be out and then dead.  And then whatever happens after that, you know, just eternity with a fucking barbecue  next to you.  Some burgers.  You should have at least put some food on there for the people that found them.  Yeah.  All right.  Hey, this guy was nice. 
[01:03:00]  Look at that.  He's even got some mustard next to his pills and a suicide note.  That's how he kept the suicide note from blowing off.  It was a little tin of Gouldens.  Cops are all doing Grey Poupon jokes.  Do you have any Grey Poupon?  I can't hear you.  Get it?  He's dead.  Keep up the bad work, Brad.  The other member of Boston used to hang out at all the AF parties.  What the fuck was his name?  The drummer, right?  Sid?  Sib.  Sib or something like that. 
[01:03:30]  Yeah.  He was a fan of our old show there.  Didn't he kill himself with a waffle iron?  The George Foreman grill.  Just kept pressing his face over and over again.  Fucking draining all the fluid out.  It was just bubbling.  You know what?  The smoke of two charcoal grills he lit inside his sealed bathroom.  He was found by his fiancee, Pamela Sullivan, lying on a pillow on the bathroom floor with  a suicide note, pinned to his shirt, stating that he was a lonely soul.  That's nice for your fiancee to find. 
[01:04:00]  Yeah.  Thanks.  Lonely?  Well, that could have been a hit record.  Called Lonely Soul.  Right.  He looked at him in the bathroom.  Lonely Soul.  Lonely Soul.  Soul, soul, soul, soul, soul, soul, soul, soul, soul, barbecue, barbecue.  No?  Yes.  The rest of the band gets together and just comes up with a song, Lonely Soul, but that's  the only words they have because they want to keep it pure because that's all he wrote.  But they spell it S-O-L-E to symbolize the fish that he could have been cooking on the  barbecue. 
[01:04:30]  See, this is off-the-cuff stuff, people.  That's why we're great.  We're called Winging It Here.  We are the best at winging it.  Oh.  Other radio shows don't understand.  Oh, we're just winging it.  You've got to be brave and just wing it every once in a while.  And if we're not the best, we're in the top 50 or 60.  No, we're the best.  We're the best.  Top 50 or 60.  This is how far back the first Boston album goes.  34 years ago.  So Boston's first album, 33 years ago.  What year is that?  I don't want to do math.  76.  All righty. 
[01:05:00]  So in 75, Patty Hearst.  Patty Hearst?  The FBI captured Patty.  The Symbianese Liberation Army, was it?  SLA?  Yeah, the FBI captured her 34 years ago.  Today.  Oh, today?  Oh, okay.  Called herself Tanya.  Where is she now?  Is she alive or dead?  She's fine.  She's fucking on some reality shows sometimes.  She pops on.  She did a little prison stint.  And that was that.  And her daughter, I think, is in entertainment now or something.  Yeah.  Like a singer or, I don't know, something.  Yeah, she took right to that. 
[01:05:30]  Holding a machine gun in the bank.  That did her in.  That fucking picture of them when they were robbing the bank.  And she's just standing there with a machine gun.  All right.  I think she's really into it.  One of these rich little girls that wanted a little excitement in her life back then  and decided she was going to, you know, leave the Hearst fortune and become a bank robber.  She did go to jail, though, for how long?  Oh, yeah.  I'm not sure.  It wasn't...  Two months.  No, it was a couple of years.  A few years.  I'm not sure.  You got that info there, Daniel?  How come she didn't do 25 when you were a bank robber?  I know.  I'm kind of curious. 
[01:06:00]  Well, when your family is the Hearst family.  Do you think they were embarrassed by her shenanigans?  Could have been.  And at first, it was like, oh, my God, she was kidnapped.  This is horrible.  And then it was like, wait a minute.  She's digging these guys.  She wasn't really kidnapped, was she?  They think it was a bunch of fudge?  Pardon my French?  Yeah, they think it was.  Or she insists she was kidnapped, but they brainwashed her.  Yeah.  But apparently the court didn't decide it.  There's that picture of her with the fucking machine gun. 
[01:06:30]  What a clear bank picture that is.  Wow.  That's good there, too.  Nice long neck.  Jesus.  Yeah, yeah, long neck.  She was sexy.  Yeah, she was all right.  Yeah, I wouldn't mind taking that hat off.  Guys who want to say sex but don't know how to be dirty, I wouldn't mind taking her hat  off and giving her an old bank robbery.  Oh!  What's that mean?  Well, we have a brand new manhole promo.  Yeah.  This is our dream that SiriusXM has a channel called The Manhole.  And it's basically women doing edgy, locker room-type guy talk. 
[01:07:00]  35 years she got the letter out after seven.  35 years?  That means she would still be in jail.  It said seven, right?  Seven years?  Yeah.  35 years in prison.  Her sentence was later commuted to seven years.  Her prison term was also eventually commuted by President Jimmy Carter, released from prison  on February having served 22 months.  You get a 35-year sentence and you serve 22 months?  And she was granted a full pardon by Bill Clinton in 2001. 
[01:07:30]  Did you friend with the Hearst?  How does that?  The Hearst?  Man, that is fucking ridiculous.  That's like the tax thing we were talking about.  What is it going to be?  For real?  If it's 35 years, it should be 35 years.  No.  35 fucking years.  Wow.  And then completely like, hey, it never happened.  Nah.  Whatever.  All right.  Now she's on red carpets and stuff.  God bless.  Anyway, Manhole.  So it's a channel we think would be very good here at SiriusXM.  Pitching it.  A bunch of women just getting edgy.  Mm-hmm.  And, well, the Manhole channel, which doesn't exist, is paying attention to us very closely. 
[01:08:00]  Yes.  And they kind of did a Sex and the City type of riff here.  Really?  Take a listen.  Today on the Manhole, extreme guy talk done by women.  Catch Rita and Janice in the Labia Lounge.  All right.  Look who's coming into the studio.  It's Cherry and Melissa, the lesbian exhibitionist.  Hi, girls. 
[01:08:30]  Ooh, Cherry, what is that you brought with you?  This is my favorite vibrator, the rabbit.  Oh, my God.  Is that the one Samantha has in Sex and the City?  It so is.  I heard they're making another movie.  I can't wait.  I can't wait to see Carrie's shoes.  I know.  I can't wait to see what Samantha says next.  I wonder what's going to happen to Miranda's boyfriend so cute in the last movie.  Oh, my God.  I can't wait to see Miranda's movie.  Oh, my God.  Those bitches sure can't babble.  Catch Rita and Janice today in the Labia Lounge, 3 p.m. Eastern, on the Manhole. 
[01:09:00]  All hole, all the time.  All hole, all the time.  They kind of slipped out of what they were supposed to be talking about.  Yeah, it's all right.  I like that one.  That was good.  Speaking of, there was something in there that reminded me of a commercial that's on that is so disturbing.  Trojan has put out this little thing that you slip over your finger, if you're a woman, and it's got like little bristles on it, little rubbery bristles on it. 
[01:09:30]  So you scrub out your hole?  But it vibrates.  Okay.  So they, it's called the, yeah, oh, you got the commercial?  Okay, here it is.  This is so bad.  Uh, and, and they, they, you fucking diddle yourself with it.  With the little brushy thing?  You put it on your finger, there's a, but it's battery power.  It's like tiny battery, so it vibrates.  And you, you diddle your clit with it, and it's, it's right on the tip of your finger. 
[01:10:00]  And there's these two women at, I guess they're waiting to have their hair done.  And they're sitting in the, um, reception area.  And, uh, they start chatting about it.  This old fucking Lucy ready to die, Lucille Ball ready to die bag is sitting behind them  and kind of listens to the conversation.  And then one of the girls goes, oh, uh, uh, you know, where can I get one?  Or, or says something.  And the old woman implies that she has one. 
[01:10:30]  Ugh.  This is, you play the commercial.  It's, um, you got the volume up on that?  Oh, yeah, I got it.  All right, here we go.  Is that what I think it is?  Yeah, it's new from Trojan.  It's that vibrating touch that everyone's talking about?  Yeah, the little personal massager that goes right on the tip of your finger, huh?  Wow, it's so cute.  My girlfriend has one, and she's been raving about it for weeks.  In fact, she told me that you could actually, um... 
[01:11:00]  Uh-oh, they're whispering.  Okay, I have definitely got to get one of these.  Yeah, you and me both.  Does it say where you can get one?  Uh, let's see.  Relax, girls.  You can get them right online.  Well, that's where I got mine.  Ugh.  Finally, a personal massager that women aren't afraid to talk about from Trojan, a brand you know and trust.  To learn more or to purchase, go to vibratingtouch.com and hear what real women are saying.  It's so small and discreet, and it comes in this awesome little bag. 
[01:11:30]  It's good for a relationship, let's put it that way.  For complete details, or to order one for yourself or as a gift, go to vibratingtouch.com today.  It's good for a relationship?  Yeah.  Implying, you know...  That's where I got mine!  She is a decrepit old bag.  This isn't even, like, trying...  They weren't even trying to make it seem like she was an old cougar or anything.  Yeah.  She's like a grandmother multiple times over, and she's, like, looking at these girls, rolling 
[01:12:00]  her eyes around, like, uh-huh, they don't even know about this yet?  I've been fucking diddling my dried-up piece of Indian corn for a while.  I was like, ugh.  Horrible.  God, that is, like...  It was in an office setting, and there's two girls, they're talking.  Yeah.  And it's the worst acting ever.  They're pretending to whisper, but they're not leaning in.  Oh, when, you know, I heard what you can do with it is...  She's like, you just...  All I'm thinking is horrific things.  Shove it up your asshole. 
[01:12:30]  Yeah.  Pull shit out and then brush your teeth with it.  Exactly.  Pick your nose with it and get a little vibrate-y feeling in your brain.  It's just some stupid things.  Horrible.  But, yeah, that's...  It really is interesting when I saw that also, besides just being horrified by the entire  thing, how it was growing up, how they were like, you want to put a bra commercial on  television where they actually show a woman in a bra?  Remember they just used to show suspended brassieres that, like, looked like it had an invisible 
[01:13:00]  woman in it?  Right.  And they'd spin it around and go, the cross-year-hack bra.  Yeah, they didn't even have it on a mannequin.  No.  Because that would have been too crazy.  That was crazy.  And then it was like, oh my God, they're actually putting a woman in a bra on an ad.  And then condoms.  That was another huge thing.  Condom ads on television.  Wah.  Wah.  Wah.  And now it's just, you know...  Now it's...  I'm going...  They're like women talking about diddling their pussy with a vibrator on, you know, regular 
[01:13:30]  TV.  And it's just...  We have come leaps and bounds as far as that goes.  And we can't have a naked girl on the radio.  No.  Diddling herself.  No.  We're not pornographers.  Yeah.  Huh.  Huh.  I wish we were.  All right, Ian.  This is interesting.  I don't know why we get under everyone's skin, but we do.  And...  What the hell could we have possibly fucking done today?  Sue Simmons is on the phone.  And we...  Oh, okay.  And we do enjoy it.  But for some reason, people just get so mad when it comes to us. 
[01:14:00]  People that we haven't even thought of or talked about in a really long time.  Kyle, what do you got?  Hey, boys.  Hey, Kyle.  Unfortunately, I don't get sound at radio.  I just get it in my car, but my alarm is up in the morning.  Anyway, I turn it on, and Mancow's on the radio this morning.  And he goes into this diatribe of how you, you guys, Uppy and Anthony, are the most vile radio guys. 
[01:14:30]  You make Stern look subtle.  Compliment.  Thank you.  Good.  You fucking ass.  Good will conquer evil.  You are horrible.  He will be around.  That's why you're getting thrown off.  Stay true to yourselves.  How are we getting thrown off?  Another guy that knows something that we don't know.  Like when Bobo said we were getting thrown off radio, he goes, trust me, I know for a fact.  He said that probably a year and a half ago.  The Uppy and Anthony show has been around for over a decade. 
[01:15:00]  We've been around for how long has the Uppy and Anthony show?  15 years.  About 15 fucking years.  And every time we get a gig, someone says, oh, they're so gone, like, next month or this.  Contract's up.  You won't be seeing them again.  And we continue.  Eventually, one of these dopes will be right.  Yeah, because.  Because all radio careers do eventually end.  Yeah, yeah.  And then some media will be going, see, I told you.  Told you.  This show is like AIDS, but with worse results.  Damaging. 
[01:15:30]  If we left tomorrow, if we left tomorrow, we still put in 15 amazing years.  This fucking asshole.  And the good conquering evil, he likes to forget all the crap he did on the radio.  Hey, ah, ah, turd.  Ah, turd.  What, ah, ah, you're driving the car toward the wall, turd.  Shut up.  That's the interesting thing about this.  We're in, you know, Alabama, which is, you know, god awful anyway.  But the thing is, is that it's on, what he's on, it's a syndicated news channel that has no reach. 
[01:16:00]  And they cut his show, he comes on at five, and they cut it off at like eight.  And his show really goes to 10 for like one or something like that.  He is.  You're right.  It's a completely different format.  It's, he's more, it's all politics now.  That's why I didn't even recognize it when I heard him talk.  I mean, we delve into politics, believe me, but for the most part, it's just whatever,  yeah, whatever we feel like talking about.  If it's Samantha's pussy, we'll talk about that. 
[01:16:30]  But, uh, Mankow has, uh, thinks he can just change, uh, like Rush Limbaugh apparently was  a music jock years ago.  Was he?  And then, yeah.  And then he decided, uh, during the, especially during the Clinton administration, uh, that  he had a great thing to do.  He could go on, become a conservative talk show host, and he's making millions of fucking  dollars and has a huge syndication.  And, and Mankow thinks he could do that, but the difference is he doesn't have any credibility 
[01:17:00]  with the, um, with the right, with the conservatives, with, uh, the Republicans.  See, that's the thing.  If he says he's good friends, listen, now, I'll be talking to you on the table.  Right.  He says he, he says he's good friends with Rush Limbaugh, great friends with Hannity, Levine,  all of his guys.  All right, let me stop you right there.  He's great friends with Hannity.  Um, I think he's been on Hannity maybe a couple times.  Has he?  Not recently.  Mm-hmm.  Ant's doing, um, Hannity on a semi-regular basis at this point.  Yeah.  Jimmy's been on Hannity. 
[01:17:30]  I've been on Hannity, even.  Even though I hate fucking politics.  He's a guy that, uh, he couldn't continue doing what, what made him famous and rich, by  the way.  Yeah, yeah.  In the last.  He did a lot of edgy, shock.  Let me finish, all right?  No, I don't want to finish that.  What?  No, no, I don't want to finish.  What else did this idiot say?  No, what I want to say is, though, he did edgy, shock, shock shit that made him very famous  and very rich.  Yeah.  And he wants to now, like, forget about that. 
[01:18:00]  That's why he's living in, I would assume, a really nice house.  Yeah.  And he couldn't continue it because he couldn't figure out a way around the rules and stuff.  So he goes, oh, I got to do something different.  And, uh, he just found politics?  Yeah.  One day?  That's what happened.  He saw people making money.  Well, he said, he said what y'all do is entirely too easy.  And what he does, it's entertaining.  Different ways to say different things.  And he really has to apply himself.  It's a great audience.  Another jealous guy.  I would love to hear y'all comment over what he was saying. 
[01:18:30]  Yeah, if the guys can find it.  I don't know where you find a podcast these days.  I don't know where you find fucking Man Cow.  I really don't know.  I wouldn't know where to find Man Cow Audio.  I know.  Hey, Jimmy.  He talks over everybody.  You can say whatever you need to say.  I'm right here, buddy.  Hey, man.  Are you ever going to come down to the South anytime?  I know we're scary and everything.  I have two Virginia gigs booked on the next couple of months.  That's barely the South, Jimmy.  What are you talking about?  They're talking deep South.  Well, where are you, sir?  Alabama. 
[01:19:00]  I'm in Alabama.  I know nobody's coming to the Star Dome, Jimmy.  But, I mean, we can come to, like, Atlanta or something.  I was just in Atlanta, sir.  Oh, well, Christ.  I need to update your webpage tonight.  You can't just get satellite in the car, would you?  What's that?  You just get satellite in the car.  I do have satellite in the car.  Oh, okay.  All right.  Then you'll hear what I'm calling back.  Oh, someone's bringing back an old bit.  Thank you, Kyle, for the info.  We'll try to search out that audio.  I appreciate it.  By the way, Danny, that omelet smells like feet.  Well, and your breakfasts always smell delicious. 
[01:19:30]  No, but they're just plain egg whites.  No, plain egg whites smell horrible.  They smell horrendous every day.  It smells like vomit.  All our food smells horrendous.  It smells like, it's like, I couldn't see what Danny's eating.  I just smell feet.  It's egg whites, Jim.  But what's on it?  Feet.  Mushroom and onions.  Onions, what do you smell?  Onion feet?  Onion feet.  It smells like bag?  It smells like somebody had been walking and then decided to be served as breakfast.  Two severed footsies.  That's how they scrambled his eggs with their savage feet. 
[01:20:00]  You guys eat like the worst shit every day.  Language.  I have some onions.  Language.  It's a problem.  This is my home.  Eric in Virginia.  Eric.  If half your town doesn't have indoor plumbing, get on Man Cow Country.  Libby, Libby.  You want to bring back the Man Cow Country?  Man Cow Country.  I love Man.  Remember Man Cow Country?  If you guys want to work the Man Cow Country bit today, I'd appreciate it.  Because all of his cities.  Last time he was trashing us, we were like, all right, where's this guy broadcasting to?  It used to be like the big thing in Chicago. 
[01:20:30]  And we looked up his stations, and they're all tiny little markets in the middle of nowhere.  So now there's a bit that, yeah, people do.  If this is happening, then you're in Man Cow Country.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like if a big problem is your cattle getting anthrax.  You're in Man Cow Country!  I guess he broadcasts out of Chicago, but he's not even heard in Chicago.  It's just that you might be a redneck thing, but it's Man Cow Country.  Man Cow Country. 
[01:21:00]  It's that easy, people.  It's that easy, kids.  Let's say hi to Mike in Jersey.  Mike?  Hey.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Hello?  Hi, Mike.  Hi, Mike.  How you guys doing?  Better now that you called, Mike.  Have you guys heard about when Man Cow had himself waterboarded on his show to prove that it wasn't torture?  But he lasted about a second and immediately said it was?  What an asshole.  Oh, he's such a fucking asshole. 
[01:21:30]  And by the way, he did that for publicity.  Yeah, yeah.  The big thing was waterboarding.  I'm going to be waterboarded.  That's what I'm going to do.  I'm going to waterboard myself.  Turd!  Turd!  Turd!  Turd!  Turd!  Turd!  Put the wet rag over my mouth and nose and then pour water on me.  I'm going to be waterboarded.  Okay, stop!  Turd!  Turd!  Turd!  Turd!  Turd!  Turd!  Turd!  Turd!  Turd!  What's your show, Man Cow?  Turd!  Turd!  Turd!  It's turd!  Ah! 
[01:22:00]  All right, let's move on.  That's a video.  Of what?  Oh, the waterboard?  I'm holding his nose as he speaks, okay?  Move down a little.  You're squeezing the top of my nose.  There you go.  Shut up.  You're being tortured.  I'll have to get over here that way.  I can get a good grip.  All right, here's the bucket of water in his head.  The sergeant is over, Man Cow's head.  We're going to do it on five, okay?  One, two.  I lied.  Ooh, water going...  All right, that's it.  That's it.  All right.  He lasted... 
[01:22:30]  Oh, God.  Man Cow is soaked.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, he's soaked.  Watch out.  I've got a little water on him.  There could be a problem.  He needs a towel.  How do you feel?  You want the EMT?  No, no, no.  EMT's here.  No, no, it's okay.  What a favorite drama queen.  It is way worse than I thought it would be.  Shut the fuck up.  It is way worse than I thought it would be.  And that's no joke.  Would you consider that torture?  Look, all that's been done to this country, and I heard about water being dropped on someone's face, 
[01:23:00]  and I never considered torture.  Even when I was laying there, I thought, this is going to be no big deal.  I go swimming.  It's going to be like being in the tub.  It is such an odd feeling to have water poured down your nose and your mouth with your head back.  It was instantaneous.  I thought I could hold out 30 seconds, 60 seconds.  It was instantaneous, and I don't want to say this.  I do not want to say this.  Absolutely torture.  Absolutely.  I mean, that's drowning.  So you felt like you were going to drown?  When I was a kid, when I was a kid, I drowned.  Shut up. 
[01:23:30]  I drowned.  Yes, my brother pulled me out of this.  This pool that I fell in, and I had to be revived.  And I remember the feeling, and it is the feeling of drowning.  Oh, unfortunately, your brother was around.  Holy shit.  Could have ended the whole thing right there, right at the beginning.  What a dramatic ass.  Figured we'd just give him right back to the Lord.  Fucking dramatic.  Oh, God. 
[01:24:00]  Let me tell you.  This is absolutely torture.  Absolutely torture.  No, my show.  Listening to my show.  Oh.  You had a man cow bored, people.  And bored spelt like I'm bored.  I like the fact that Ant wasn't sure how to spell bored.  So instead of going B-O-R-E-D, he just spelt like I'm bored.  Oh, I have no idea.  Sense gets me, too.  Like, this doesn't make sense.  Or a sixth sense.  S-E-N-S-E both times. 
[01:24:30]  Is it?  Yes.  Sense, like as in common sense.  S-E-N-S-E.  It's all that.  C-E-N-T-S is smell.  And smell is different.  S-C-E-N-T-S.  Smell is different.  And then what about pennies?  Pennies are spelt with a C-E-N-T-S.  I won best speller in town two years in a row.  What was the word you had to spell to win the competition?  Formaldehyde. 
[01:25:00]  God, is he a fucking drama douche.  He can't even be sincere.  Look, when he was doing this shock jock show.  I started out doing my shock jock show and made a lot of money doing that.  But he would do these bullshit bits like turd driving in the wall.  And you could hear the engine fucking right.  Can we play the turd bit again?  I have to hear the turd bit.  I hope this doesn't bore people.  But we have to.  It exposes this guy for the douche he is.  Well, the biggest problem with man cow is you don't know who the real man cow is. 
[01:25:30]  Are you the shock jock?  Are you the one that cares about the country?  Who is man cow?  That's why he can't pull this political talk thing off because he's a phony.  And when he was doing this, he can't even be honest doing this.  He's got to be overdramatic.  He can't just sincerely talk like a person and say, wow, you know something?  I'm laying there.  And I really thought I wouldn't get that feeling of drowning.  But it really gets.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Let me over dramatize this whole thing. 
[01:26:00]  And the guy comes up.  You need the EMTs?  Shut the fuck up.  What an asshole.  It's funny you say that.  And Iraq walked in.  He didn't mean you, Eric.  No.  Hello.  Here's the fake car stunt.  This is one of my favorites.  It is so bad.  Basically, get the premise.  And he was selling this as completely honest he was doing this.  Get the premise.  Live on the air.  He's going to test out an airbag.  So Turd is going to ram his car into a brick wall. 
[01:26:30]  A brick wall.  Turd is going to drive his car into a brick wall to test the airbag to see if the airbag works.  Yeah.  And it's all going out live on Man Cow's show.  Listen to.  First of all, take note that you would not be able to get this audio.  You could tell it was put together in a studio because the engine sound is different.  It's a sound effects library.  The screeching wheels.  The impact. 
[01:27:00]  You wouldn't hear the impact because the microphone would be fucked up.  It's done in the studio.  It's atrocious.  Horrid.  So what?  Atrocious.  Um, A-T-R-O-C-I-O-U-S.  Give yourself a bell.  What is it?  I don't know.  I have no idea either.  Turd?  Yes, sir.  Are you ready, bud?  15.  15 miles an hour.  He's going to give us the countdown.  20.  Racing into the side of a factory. 
[01:27:30]  25.  30.  30 miles an hour.  Anything happens to him, pal?  35.  35 miles an hour right now.  Oh, my.  Maximum speed of 60.  30.  A long course has been set up.  Oh, my God.  Come on, Turd.  35.  35.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah! 
[01:28:00]  That sound familiar?  No, I mean, he used one of these.  We have a longer skid, but it's the same crash.  It's weird because the glass breaking sounds like, doesn't sound like auto glass.  Auto glass doesn't break like that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Auto glass kind of chinks out in little squares.  Yeah.  Hey, watch your language.  Yes.  Oh, don't be fresh.  And, of course, Danny noticed what I noticed also.  From 15 miles an hour to 45 miles an hour and beyond, the engine never went up or down 
[01:28:30]  or anything.  He held his foot on that gas pedal perfectly.  You could actually make the bit sound like it might be real if you actually had Turd in  a car in a parking lot.  Yeah.  Actually speeding.  Speeding.  And then at the last minute.  Segging to the fake crash.  Segging to the fake crash if you want to be a big phony piece of cunt like him.  But to have that fake, and then why did he step on the brake? 
[01:29:00]  He's supposed to be hitting the wall.  Well, because he chickened out at the end.  And he screams, ah, and then there's dramatic music.  What an asshole.  I actually think that was real.  Can we hear that again?  Shut up, Jimmy.  The whole thing?  Yeah.  Fuck.  Come on, please.  Turd?  Turd?  Are you ready, bud?  15.  15 miles an hour.  He's going to give us the countdown.  20.  Racing into the side of a factory.  25.  30.  30 miles an hour. 
[01:29:30]  Anything happens to him, pal?  35.  35 miles an hour right now.  Oh, my God.  Maximum speed of 65.  A long course has been set up.  Oh, my God.  Come on, Turd.  We got a turn.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  The douche chill inducing that that does to me.  I can't handle that. 
[01:30:00]  I'm only curious, though, because I never heard a dial tone on a cell phone before.  Yeah, yeah, that dial tone.  Boo!  Oh, please.  Just please.  I got a whole disc of his horse shit.  His horse shit.  And this is why, by the way, he tries and tries to be accepted as a conservative talk  show host, and they will not accept him.  He's not good enough at it, first of all.  Secondly, he comes from that?  Well, stop it.  Well, you're a big fan and a caller. 
[01:30:30]  Yeah.  Remember that?  Yes.  I was a really good caller once.  Anthony just called to make a salient point.  I set it up really nicely, and he hung up on me before the big fucking payoff, so all  I did was give him a good phone call and a good topic.  He had a good idea.  That was a very good comment.  Thanks.  We could replay that.  I would love to hear that.  All right.  But first, we'll end with that.  Remember a little event called 9-11?  I think I do.  Sure.  It was happening in New York, but he's broadcasting from Chicago. 
[01:31:00]  Yeah, yeah.  He's another one of these guys that has to always turn around and make it about himself.  Make it about him.  So this was his big concern on 9-11 as buildings were falling down all over the fucking place.  Guys, we are the same.  I mean, L.A. has no tall buildings because it's an earthquake zone.  Wait a minute.  What is the biggest building?  Hold on a second.  We have our own zip code here.  I broadcast from a building with very political ties, a Kennedy family.  Sure.  Started this.  It's called the Merchandise Mart, and it is second only in some. 
[01:31:30]  Hold on.  Hold on.  Look.  You don't go the Twin Towers, the Pentagon, potentially the White House, and then the Merchandise Mart.  They really, you know, Al-Qaeda, the Taliban, whatever, Al-Qaeda, they weren't gunning for the Merchandise Mart.  Holy shit.  But I think, given the choice, if the fucking pilot, that savage pilot was aiming his plane 
[01:32:00]  down and saw the Merchandise Mart or a Petco, he'd probably hit the Petco.  Oh, my gosh.  Listen, though.  He's got to make it about himself.  Yeah.  One of the biggest events ever.  He's got to somehow figure out how it's going to affect him at that moment.  A building with very political ties.  The Kennedy family started this.  It's called the Merchandise Mart, and it is second only in size to the Pentagon.  You want to go home?  It's a target.  Maybe we should. 
[01:32:30]  No, I don't want to go home.  I'm going to push it out.  And now, as you can see, the entire floor is burning.  Holy shit.  No, I don't want to go home.  I'm going to be brave here at the Merchandise Mart, which is target number 6,842.  There's not enough planes.  You just got the manifesto?  Yeah.  Yeah.  The manifesto.  You had to go to page 250 to realize it might be a threat.  There's not enough planes. 
[01:33:00]  They would actually be out of every type of aircraft where maybe a hang glider with a  fucking, a hang glider with a guy with an M-80.  Or paper planes.  Paper planes.  Just tipping firecrackers to paper planes.  We're under attack here, turd, turd.  We're at the Merchandise Mart, turd.  Ugh.  And then this.  Is that the Merchandise Mart?  Yeah.  And then this.  It's not big at all.  And then this on 9-11.  All right. 
[01:33:30]  I have got to, I want to go look at.  Oh, wait.  Wait a minute.  So that building isn't the big one in Chicago?  No.  It's not tall.  The Merchandise Mart is not that tall.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  That's the building?  It's the Sears Tower and the Hancock building.  Are we looking at a six-story building?  Yes, but it's a block long.  One, two, three, four, five, seven-story building.  Seven-story tall building.  In the middle of Chicago.  Yeah.  He's worried that a plane's going to hit that back in 2001.  Wouldn't you go for the fucking Sears Tower? 
[01:34:00]  I thought that was just another name for the Sears Tower.  For real.  I'm like, you know, that's.  No.  They would go for the Sears Tower way before this dumb little seven-story building.  It has its own zip code because it's just a massive width.  It's a long building.  Yeah.  It's a big building, but it's not high.  No, it's not high.  That's stupid.  Just stop this hole.  Just stop, you fucking fraud.  Then he continues with this.  All right.  I have got to.  I want to go.  Look, guys, I'm in a building that could possibly be targeted. 
[01:34:30]  I am angry now.  He's making it about him with his phony fucking voice.  Can you believe this guy?  He got real.  Yeah.  Eight years later and listening to this is making me angry because I remember what that was like.  Like, like to be in New York and even us, we knew we were fine.  We knew we were fine out on Long Island.  You just knew.  But then we had to come back to this.  We came back to the city on September 12th.  That's right. 
[01:35:00]  The next day.  Yeah, the 12th.  And we were in a big building.  But even then, it would be so easy to go, yeah, we weren't really sure.  No, we knew we were safe.  All the planes were grounded over the United States and everything.  We were fine.  Right.  And to tell you the truth, we would have broadcasted from our own building.  We couldn't get into Manhattan.  Yeah, they pretty much shut down Manhattan.  But we were going to broadcast from the building that we were in.  But this guy is like, look, I'm in a building that could potentially be targeted.  Importantness for that is man cow and turd. 
[01:35:30]  My God, what if they get turd?  Shut up.  Look up the building for yourself on Google.  It's I think it was seven stories.  That was it.  With tall buildings around it, by the way.  So it would be hard to even, you know, have a plane run.  You'll never be accepted as a conservative talk show host, you fucking lame dummy.  So because a shit like this, you're an embarrassment.  9-11 and you try to make it about you being in danger when firemen are running up fucking  the Twin Towers and they're collapsing. 
[01:36:00]  But you had to make it about you potentially being in danger.  As people are jumping to their deaths.  Drama fucking queen.  Because what a cunt.  I hate this motherfucker.  I hate man cow.  Yeah, people jump into their deaths because they don't want to burn alive.  They'd rather die that way.  And you're worried you're in a seven story building.  Really?  Yeah, just stop it.  Here's the rest of the clip.  All right.  I have got to.  I want to go.  Look, guys, I'm in a building that could possibly be targeted second in size only in America 
[01:36:30]  to the White House or excuse me, to the Pentagon called the Merchandise Mart.  And I'm going to.  Pentagon has already been hit.  Guys, I hope you'll forgive me.  I want to go call my family and I will continue to broadcast.  We'll be right back.  That was fake.  That was fake drama.  You fake.  That was so fake.  And he's still a phony.  That's the same kind of with the waterboarding just before that we listened to.  That was more recent. 
[01:37:00]  Let me tell you something.  That absolutely is torture.  And by the way, who cares if it's torture?  They're using it on fucking criminals.  Good.  And I explain myself, Aaron.  The fucking Merchandise Mart.  Oh, Sears Tower is the Merchandise Mart.  I didn't know if that was another name.  I've never been to Chicago.  Hey, lighten up, Chicago.  Right.  I didn't know.  I assume maybe.  I don't know.  Yeah.  It's a different name.  Because what?  No, I assume that.  I'll be honest with you.  Because he's selling it so much. 
[01:37:30]  I'm like, oh, wow.  He's got to be in the Sears Tower.  And even if he was, he would be safe.  You fucking come here and do a little talk about the Flatiron Building and Times Square  and the Chrysler Building.  Go ahead.  Do a little riff on it.  You dolt.  What else do you want to play from here?  There's just so much.  You know what happens when you assume.  That's right.  You're making a sue out of mmm and e.  You stink. 
[01:38:00]  Here's a piece of his demo.  I love it.  Here's a piece of his demo.  His dummo?  He's trying to get all the stations to hire him.  Because it feels so empty without me.  Shut me down because I say it the way it is.  This looks like a job for me.  So we're here.  Just follow me.  We are here.  Because we need a little controversy.  Welcome to Free Speech.  Taking more calls than any of the radio shows in America. 
[01:38:30]  We want to give you a voice.  1-888-2-MAN-COW.  I guess because, you know, the first day back in San Francisco here on a major powerhouse station.  Man, this is exciting.  100,000 watts.  You ought to see the footprint on this thing.  What?  We basically cover.  This is basically everyone in California is hearing us right now.  So this is cool.  Awesome.  Shut up.  Everyone in California, really?  You're on a dumb AM station in San Francisco?  Isn't there a 50,000-watt limit?  That's a few years ago now. 
[01:39:00]  God.  Every word out of his mouth is a lie.  It's just utter bullshit.  When Howard left CBS, he went on Hannity, this man-cow, and claimed this.  Ah, this is awesome.  And I said, wait till number one fails.  Wait till the second Stern replacement fails.  And then the third Stern replacement's going to be you.  That's great.  I get to be the third Stern replacement.  You can tell this guy thinks the world of me. 
[01:39:30]  Right.  I replaced a legend in New York by the name of Bob Grant.  Right.  And I was the third.  Never heard of him.  Yeah, well, you're not in New York.  But listen, Sean.  Sean, here's the thing.  You never want to come on after a show that was popular.  And I understand that.  And I never wanted to do it.  I never, ever.  And it was offered to me at one point.  And I don't want to do it.  I didn't want to do it.  And the thing is, why?  So let me get this straight, Anthony.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Man-cow was offered Howard's gig.  Yep.  Which was worth, by the way, millions and millions of dollars. 
[01:40:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And he chose not to do it, right?  Yep.  He said no to millions and millions of dollars, right?  No, I don't want to be in the number one radio market.  Right, broadcasting.  And have a lot of money.  And yeah.  Yeah.  Fucking liar.  And it was offered to me at one point.  And I don't want to do it.  I didn't want to do it.  And the thing is, why would I want that?  The audiences have left.  I've got to go build an audience for a company that I don't like.  I'm fine here where I'm working for people I like.  Ha ha.  Sometimes.  By the way, we spoke with a lot of management about that, and they confirmed that, no, he 
[01:40:30]  was never even considered for the job.  They can't stand man-cow.  He was actually calling them trying to get the gig.  Yeah, he was calling them and sending demo tapes and begging to get the gig.  It was never offered to him.  He is full of shit.  Business is just filled with liars.  Oh.  One honest moment out of that motherfucker would be fantastic. 
[01:41:00]  And I bet it would be sucking on a big cock.  I'm being honest right now.  So a couple years ago, man-cow went after us, so we beat him up because it's easy to beat  him up.  Yeah.  It's kind of boring at this point.  Phony.  But we decided Anthony needs to confront the guy.  So Anthony, we talked to the phone screener, and the phone screener didn't know it was Anthony. 
[01:41:30]  No, no.  I'm hoping Anthony just thought it was—  I was going to make a prank call.  Right.  I was making a prank phone call.  I just thought it was going to be a good call.  So Anthony's on hold, and we're like, holy shit, you're going to finally get to rip into  man-cow.  I thought up a topic that was relevant to what they were talking about with enough information  to the screener that he would go, okay, they put me on for this.  And they indeed put me on hold.  He said, all right, wait for the cow.  And then they gave me all the preliminary what I have to do and what I have to say. 
[01:42:00]  Do you want to hear that part?  Oh, please.  Because it exposes him again for being such a phony.  They instruct you to say things to make man-cow seem bigger and more important and more loved  than he is.  Yeah.  By the way, if you're keeping track at home, they're bouncing today.  Holy shit, I missed them.  They're bouncing.  Damn it.  Not that long bounce either.  The little—  Yeah.  Bubble.  A slow, heavy, full bounce.  Oh, but—  She does have nice full ones.  But pops right back.  You know the ones that pop right back? 
[01:42:30]  Yeah.  Bounce, pop back.  Yeah.  Yeah, so Anthony talking to the phone screener so he could get on live,  and then he's going to set up a nice phone call with man-cow and then rip into him.  Man-cow, what's your topic?  Hi, how are you doing?  I'm great.  What do you want to say to man-cow?  Want to talk to the cow today?  A little bit about this situation with Britain and the sailors.  Okay, what do you want to say about that?  I want to say I believe that the United States is being kept out of this by Britain  because we have such a bad worldview that people look at the United States as troublemakers. 
[01:43:00]  And I think Britain is kind of snubbing us on this one.  Okay, so they're keeping the USA out of it?  Yeah, it's a statement that has been released from Britain that wants the United States to lay back on this  and not get involved.  We should be all over this subject.  All over it.  And the president's not even commenting, and that is because Britain has told us not to  because the worldview of the United States is very poor, and this wouldn't help. 
[01:43:30]  They said it wouldn't help for the United States to become involved.  Huh.  What's your first name?  Tony.  Tony.  Where are you calling from?  Calling from New York.  Oops.  Listening online.  Very good.  A couple of things for the show, man.  Got to keep your radio or your audio down.  Got it.  Keep your comments clean, short and sweet, to the point, and start off by saying, 
[01:44:00]  ManCal, love you, love your show, okay?  You got it.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you.  That's great.  You had to say, love you, love the show.  Who the fuck instructs their screener to tell the listeners to say, ManCal, love you,  love the show?  It's self-adulation.  If we go to the forums and someone goes, hey, love you guys, whatever, that's cool.  Yeah.  They weren't instructed.  Right.  No, we don't instruct.  Oh, my God.  That's embarrassing.  Hey, ManCal, love you, love the show.  So here's how it went down. 
[01:44:30]  So here's the call.  Now, by the way.  Stage one worked out perfect.  Now, hold on, because, by the way, I was going to fucking unload on ManCal.  Obviously, this is a great setup for my prank that I was going to do and unload on him about  how phony he is and everything.  But this was my way of getting in, loosening him up, getting their guard down so I could  attack.  Sure it was, fanboy.  Tony in New York, hello.  ManCal, love you, love the show, man.  Thank you, buddy.  Hey, I want to talk a little bit about this Britain situation with the sailors that were 
[01:45:00]  taken hostage, as I see it.  There's a problem.  I don't see the president speaking out on this.  And now I'm hearing that the United States has been told not to comment by Britain because  of the worldview of our country.  The British are telling us to please stay out of this so as not to make trouble.  I see this as maybe Britain turning on us a little bit as an ally in this situation. 
[01:45:30]  What do you think about this?  Well, I think that's a brilliant thing.  I think that's a brilliant question.  Thank you.  Thank you, ManCal.  I think we need to keep our nose out of it right now.  I think we got all over like that, well, Sam Childers knew this pygmy woman in Uganda.  She's a nice girl.  She's always sticking her nose in people's business.  And I think we need to keep our nose out of everybody's business right now.  And I think England is saying, let us handle it.  And I'm okay with that for now.  But you better believe if it starts to hit the fan, once again, we'll be there to save 
[01:46:00]  them.  It's the ManCal Show.  ManCal Show.  See, I got a little too engrossed in my setup.  I think it was probably two seconds from unloading.  I was so close to like, I just wanted my spot.  I was hoping for a little follow-up maybe.  I didn't know he was one of those shows that takes the question and then hangs up on the  guy that gives you the question so he can finish without being interrupted. 
[01:46:30]  So that was very disheartening because all I did was give him what he dubbed a brilliant  question.  Well, and we beat you up.  ManCal.  He cut me off.  I knew that was going to happen too.  Yeah, you should have done him in the middle.  It was tough though.  It was actually a valid question.  I was waiting to come back.  That's why I said, do you?  Like, **** like that.  Wouldn't it be funny if Anthony just became a caller to the ManCal Show and never confronted 
[01:47:00]  him?  That's pretty much what just happened, Jimmy.  I just gave him a good **** call.  That's a big ****.  Way to go.  How funny would it be if someone overheard that and thought he handled such a, like, this  is what we're looking for and all of a sudden we were fired and he was put on in every  market.  Thanks a lot for nothing.  There you go.  I guess that was the one we replayed on Terrestrial, huh?  Who knows?  Well, I missed Terrestrial.  That was the days of fun, huh?  I love beeps.  Tee hee.  Commercial break.  Cars for care.  Right. 
[01:47:30]  Wow.  1-800.  Holy shit.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  Fucking radio stinks.  Yeah.  Thanks.  We got, uh, we're trying to see what ManCal said about us today, so that's what got that  going.  We also have eight more newsreaders cursing it on the air.  The first half we did went very well earlier this morning.  We'll continue that.  Also, uh, uh, KISS interviewed on WGN.  I gotta hear this, man.  Offer no information other than plugging during every answer. 
[01:48:00]  And this is something we noticed a long time ago, but it's getting really bad with Gene  Simmons.  So we'll have that audio as well after the break.  Kenny, bring me some bits.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.  Texas performs its 17th execution of the year.  It's weird that this came out today because we were just wondering if they were still doing  executions yesterday.  Yeah.  17 and they got two more scheduled for next week.  Nice.  Hope they could fit him in. 
[01:48:30]  They pencil him in?  Pencil that in.  That guy's sitting there right now.  Just think of that.  Right in Texas.  One of those two that they got penciled in is sitting there right now.  Just going like, oh, shit.  God damn.  Ah, shit.  This is it.  Big story today.  Ernie and Nasta said, uh, keep fucking that chicken on, um, local news here.  No, you didn't hear wrong.  That was the quote.  Yep.  And he apologized.  So we got the original clip and then the apology. 
[01:49:00]  Yeah.  In case you weren't listening earlier, trying to help you guys out a little bit.  Big story.  I know you can listen to the whole show every day.  And then we move into some.  The whole show.  And then we move into some classic, uh, newsreaders, uh, cursing on the air.  Love it.  We did the first half to start the show.  We got the second half ready to go here.  But first, uh, Ernie and Nasta, once again.  On Fox 5 Sky Guardian.  And then check that Saturday to make your weekend plans.  Takes a tough man to make a tender forecast, Nick.  I guess that's me.  Keep fucking that chicken.  Okay, I'll do that.  All right. 
[01:49:30]  Before we continue.  It's one of those things that gets funnier the more you hear it.  Yeah, it's the reaction.  Because they're all just having a good laugh.  It's the reaction is better than the curse itself.  I'll keep doing that.  Oh, and there's a Purdue commercial on, uh.  Fucking dang, man.  All right.  So that's what Ernie did.  Most of you know that by now.  The video is doing quite well.  Watch the lady's eyes get all bugged out.  They're like, oh, fuck.  Oh, shit.  And the weather guy just goes, I will.  I will.  I'll agree with anything you say. 
[01:50:00]  Oh, you're crazy, Ernie.  I sure will do that.  Fucking a chicken.  Whatever you say.  How do you know I was into bestiality?  That is the dumbest.  That proves that just they don't know what to do or don't listen or anything.  That wasn't a don't know what to do.  That's a great example of they don't listen to each other.  I will.  Because what could you possibly say that's worse than keep fucking that chicken?  Here's what happened.  The guy couldn't believe, like, the guy didn't trust that he had heard that.  Okay.  The guy heard it, but he was like, it'd be like if you were talking to somebody like 
[01:50:30]  your boss and your boss just went, listen, the job you've been doing is good.  You can take a shit in my mouth, but I'd like you to be here a little earlier.  You'd be like, okay.  He didn't just say that.  Yeah, you'd go, okay.  Yeah.  That's exactly what happened.  The guy heard it, but he was like, there's no way I just heard that.  Okay, I will.  Is that how you got your job at Caldor, by the way?  I keep, oh, Mr. Reimer was my, I have a picture of me.  Mr. Reimer?  Yeah, he's handing me a $25 check, and I have like, I'm kind of slumped in my fucking Jeffrey 
[01:51:00]  Dahmer glasses, accepting my $25 Caldor check.  Ugh.  I should show you guys the picture on Monday.  Yeah, I want to see it.  It's not good.  I want to see it.  If you bring that in, I'll bring in the video of me as the talking car.  Yeah, I want to see that one.  I'm going to spend the weekend trying to find that.  Holy shit, do I want to see that?  It might be on a format that no longer exists, though.  You know, those giant videotapes?  Oh, you'll find it somewhere.  What the fuck was it called?  Not the VHS.  Oh, that was interesting.  Not the VHS.  It was, what was that? 
[01:51:30]  The lights just flickered.  You didn't notice that?  And it got a little brighter.  A lot brighter.  Yeah, we kicked in a different power source.  It was originally the fucking thing, the generator goes bing.  I fucking know what I'm talking about.  Sorry, Jim, we can't help you, but keep showing up every day.  All right.  God damn it, now I'm mad.  Let's play some audio.  Fuck, I'm mad now, and I wasn't even mad.  Ah.  Fuck, I'm pissed off now.  What happened?  I don't know. 
[01:52:00]  I'm a cuckold.  Fuck.  What?  You weren't listening.  What happened?  I'm not mad because you weren't listening.  But what happened?  We all take our turns not listening.  Exactly, chicken fucker.  Just what Jimmy said, now I'm mad.  Oh.  I was trying to forget about what this company's doing to us.  And just come in here and have fun.  Yeah.  And then Jimmy just reminded me, and now I'm mad again.  That's Friday.  Yeah.  There you go.  Like I say, TGIF, my shirt says that.  Ah.  It says Ozzy Osbourne.  No, not the one I'm wearing right now. 
[01:52:30]  Ah, okay.  What was I going to do?  I had to read Sharon's email last night, so of course I put the Ozzy shirt on today.  Oh, Sharon sent you an email?  Why wouldn't she?  What'd she say?  Why wouldn't she?  What'd she say?  What'd she say?  Well, I had sent-  I got an email from Robert Kelly.  It's pretty much the same thing.  Same gender.  Can you get your fishing license yet?  Ugh.  What'd she say, for real?  Well, I had sent flowers because she-  Brown nose.  No, it was after the fact.  Brown nose.  It was after the fact because she had put me on the Ozzy tribute and then asked me-  You know, she just gave me a great weekend, so I sent her flowers. 
[01:53:00]  Uh-huh.  Jesus.  And she wrote, dear Jim, thank you so much for my beautiful flowers.  You didn't have to, but I'm glad you did.  Also, thank you for the picture of all of us with Subo, which is Susan Boyle, that goof  picture I had made.  Right.  Finally, I wanted to thank you again for taking part in Ozzy's tribute and introducing him  at the show on Saturday.  Please stay in touch, and Ozzy and I wish you the best of luck on the Jay Leno show from  your best friend, Sharon.  Jesus, Jimmy.  You have weaseled your way into the Osborne family. 
[01:53:30]  You have weaseled your way in.  Not really.  It was more like we're just- we just got along really well, Sharon.  I didn't talk- because Ozzy was doing warm-ups and stuff before the show.  He's, you know, before a show, you're fucking out of your mind.  You're not chit-chatting, and she was just in the hallway.  Me and her were just- people kept- everyone wanted to talk to her, and me and her were  just shooting the fucking breeze, and then everybody introduced themselves to you.  I don't care what the circumstances were, whether it's this nice situation you have  with Sharon and talking, whatever it is, you weaseled your way into the Osborne family. 
[01:54:00]  But how did you do that?  It was an invite.  I'm like a vampire.  You're a giant fan.  I was invited.  No, this is something-  You started as a stalker.  No, no, you're right.  This is something that happened very slowly over years.  You started as a giant Ozzy fan as a kid.  As a blinky mess.  As a little kid, you started as a huge Ozzy fan.  Yes, and remained so.  And as time went on, through your show biz connections, through this program, you got to 
[01:54:30]  actually meet Ozzy, get close to him a little bit, talk this little thing.  You were very nervous the first time Ozzy.  Remember the first Ozzy interview when Ozzy came in?  You were a wreck.  Well, the first time on the phone at NEW, I just sat there while you- I loved you that  day, Ed.  You were so good.  Because I couldn't talk.  I was sitting next to him.  You were a mess.  And then, over more years go by, and just these little bits and pieces of opportunity come 
[01:55:00]  through to actually meet him again, have a little chat with him, and then Sharon, and  then- and now, you're sending flowers to Sharon.  She's emailing, phone calls, messages, bringing up Ozzy.  You weaseled your way in.  But it wasn't a weaseling.  And believe me, I'm capable of a weaseling.  It's Jimmy's way of weaseling.  But a weaseling is a conscious thing.  This was one, like, we needed to get permission to use a national acrobat for the HBO special.  And the publishers and the artists get the same amount of money. 
[01:55:30]  But the publisher wanted- we had to get the artists to knock theirs down so the publishers  would come down, and Sabbath agreed we needed every band member's okay.  To sign off on it.  And Sharon signed off on it, and Ozzy signed off on it, and they gave it to me very, very  cheap.  Wow.  And then all of a sudden, a couple years later, she asked me to be on the tribute.  And plus the phone interviews we've done.  It was nothing- there was no weird letters sent, or- it was just bizarre.  Weasel!  Maybe she just knows that I'm a very public Ozzy fan.  Wow, no! 
[01:56:00]  Now she knows that by now.  A couple of people just talking.  A couple of people.  A couple of friends give Oz my best, hope he's well.  How's his back?  Good, all right.  I just find it amazing.  I think it's a childhood dream of yours finally coming true now.  I brought him on stage.  I was so happy.  It's on YouTube.  You never thought that as a kid.  Does he recognize you?  Awkward kid.  Well, when I was talking to Sharon in the hall, and he was walking by, he does like vocal  training stuff before the show, and he walked by and he just saw me, and he kind of grabbed  me, and he slapped my face, and then he just kept walking.  I was very happy.  That's what everyone should do when they see you slap your face. 
[01:56:30]  It was a nice slap.  I thought it was a big backhand.  Get the fuck out of here!  Just slap you.  Sean in North Carolina writes, how great would it be if Sharon worked Jimmy into a threesome?  I wouldn't be able to perform.  I'd be too nervous.  I'd just be praising his songs.  Jimmy's like an FBI agent that infiltrates a crime family.  That's silly vagans.  It takes years to get in there.  Jimmy Brasco.  Yes.  But I don't want information.  All I want is one of his hats. 
[01:57:00]  I just make off with his cowboy hat.  Well, I am amazed because it's just one of those things that, you know, as a kid with your  stupid boom box, walking around trying to pick girls up as you're playing Ozzy out of  your boom box.  That's humiliating.  And then there you are, bringing him up.  Oh, this is the end of this tribute.  I don't even know if he could see us walk out or not.  Yeah.  It's on YouTube.  All right.  And here's the Ernie Anastas apology for the little faux pas he had.  Yes.  Unbelievable.  Nice little stretch there. 
[01:57:30]  Enjoy it while it's here.  Thank you, Nick.  Just want to say I misspoke during last night's newscast.  I apologize for my remarks to anyone who may have been offended.  All right.  And as we continue.  The worst thing is, if you didn't see it or, you know, you're in that demo where you  don't have YouTube and shit like that and have no idea what he said, you'd be sitting  there going, what the fuck did he say?  Right.  Exactly.  Actually, oh, what the heck did he say?  And you wouldn't know.  And then you might even search it out.  So the apology, I think, even makes more people go and see what the hell he said. 
[01:58:00]  They should have replayed it.  They should have.  I said this, and I apologize for that.  When I brought up that the weatherman should fuck a chicken, people would just be looking  like, what context was that?  I apologize.  He's a vegan.  How great.  He's still clueless.  And that's what he did.  Yeah.  They didn't tell him.  They didn't tell him how.  Oh, you want me to apologize?  Okay.  Well, last night I told Dick Gregory or Nick Gregory, whatever the fuck his name is.  Nick Gregory.  I said he should continue fucking a chicken.  I want to apologize to everybody that might have been offended with my chicken fucking 
[01:58:30]  remark.  No one should fuck chickens.  It just keeps going.  It just keeps going.  It's like a network moment.  All right.  Well, that leads us to the second part of newsreaders fucking up over the years.  Yep.  We go to a weatherman out of Utica, New York.  Utica.  Yeah.  Good old Utica, New York.  The armpit of New York State.  It looks like our weather will get warmer over the next couple of days, but we have to  go through a few snow showers first. 
[01:59:00]  Your complete forecast.  All today's news.  Straight ahead on the Fox Live News.  Fuck you, mother whore.  Shit.  Oh, shit.  That's a tough one.  He's just getting a slip on that one.  He thought he was being taped.  I guess.  I guess.  Oh, no.  Do you know the panic when someone said, that went out live?  That was live.  Because you probably initially go, no, shut up.  Stop your kidding.  And then it's like, everybody's looking at you like, what did you do? 
[01:59:30]  That whoosh.  You start sweating, getting a little dizzy.  Hoping that no one caught it.  Yeah, maybe no one heard.  Maybe no one caught that.  They were all changing channels.  It was kind of ambiguous.  Possibly nobody heard that.  Wow.  We move on to the next one here.  Another weatherman.  It's just going to be kind of a mostly cloudy and cooler day before system number two takes  aim at us, and we'll see scattered showers and thunderstorms from that system unfolding  first thing on Thursday. 
[02:00:00]  That actually sounds like something you'd say, though.  Yeah, we're going to see shit scattered all over the place.  Don't worry about it.  Wow.  Is that Jimmy?  Intro on Ozzy?  Oh, my God.  Look at Jimmy.  It's a little embarrassing.  You know, I don't want to hear it.  Just watch it.  Oh, no.  I want to hear it.  Come on.  Let's hear it.  Come on.  Let's hear it.  Please?  Are you ready?  They were great, though.  Come on, you motherfuckers.  It's going to Barry Manilow concert.  Are you ready?  It isn't. 
[02:00:30]  Let me hear you make some noise.  I'm Ozzy Osbourne.  Yay.  You're going to go that fucking extra crazy from it today, okay?  Are you ready?  Are you fucking ready?  But Jimmy said that.  Let the madness begin. 
[02:01:00]  You know what is amazing about this video?  Look at all the camera phones.  I know.  Yeah.  It's all about fucking taking video, actually.  Taking video.  It's just, it's, how many are in that shot alone?  Like, 20?  Oh, wow.  More just live to their cameras.  You know, another thing.  I always think of the future, or the past, is taking this video clip back and showing people  and not telling them what's going on.  They'd be like, what is that?  What are they holding up?  They're holding up these lit little things.  Someone told me they have footage of me.  Because if you look back, it's the first time I ever got to watch them from behind the 
[02:01:30]  stage that you could see the footage of me, like, kind of dancing.  Oh, really?  I wasn't thinking of that.  Yeah.  I was very embarrassed.  Were you doing the huckabuck?  Yeah, I was.  I was doing the huckabuck.  Carl was teaching me to mambo behind the guitarist.  Mambo.  I just have to comment, Jimmy.  That was quite the energetic Jimmy.  Well, you got, what do you do?  It's like the crowd was cheering, and they really were fucking loud.  Like, they really, there was nothing else to say.  Did people think it was a Barry Manilow concert, though?  Like, I wasn't sure when you said that, if they actually thought, maybe. 
[02:02:00]  And then they went, oh, did anyone leave after you said that?  Like, fuck.  Like, I thought it was Barry.  Thank God he reminded us.  I didn't know what to say.  I just, thank you, Jim.  Some things you say in the moment, you probably look back and go, well, there might have been  a better choice of words I could have used.  And were they ready?  Yeah.  That's why I left.  They were ready.  I love you, Jimmy.  They were ready with a, ready like Helen.  Get us?  Helen ready?  I think the only one that was ready was the guy with the hook. 
[02:02:30]  He used to get him ready kid, though.  I know.  He used to get him, he was voted.  He used to get him, yeah.  Get him ready kid.  You voted that one time?  Sweetest, get him ready kid.  I was, I was voted boy most likely to get, and then in quotes, groups ready.  Oh, good.  Yeah.  Well then, you fit in perfectly.  No, that, that's a very endearing moment there.  All right.  You're very cute.  You're just like, so thrilled to be there to bring up Ozzy.  I'm very happy.  Let's get back to the newsreaders fucking up.  We're at that bridge with Barry Manilow, though. 
[02:03:00]  I know, they wanted me to bring Barry on the next night.  And I ruined it.  They were all loud.  I was like, hush now, this isn't an Ozzy Osbourne concert.  Here is a weather woman right here in New York City.  Channel 2 in New York, if you're local.  Easterly winds will be very strong, too, and that will cause coastal flooding, very dangerous  rip currents, as well as very high surf.  How many words are there that that word just comes out with?  Well, that's some dangerous shit.  It's going to rip your cuts. 
[02:03:30]  It's like rip currents.  Wow.  I bet you newsreaders hate to have people like Rich Conzini next to them because you know  they're going to slip.  Goddamn rip cunts.  I hate rip cunts.  Yes, that's Rip Taylor's wife.  You get it, rip cunts?  Of course.  Talk about rip cunts.  Right.  You know, last night I was with three African-American gentlemen, and boy was my cunt ripped.  Oh, Samantha.  Just dump a Cosmo on it. 
[02:04:00]  It'll heal again.  Just another man-made episiotomy for that fucking hole of yours.  Yeah, Cosmo cures everything.  Every disease that she's getting.  Uh, we go to, uh, Kansas City.  Mmm.  Tansas?  Wichita is in Kansas, right?  Wichita.  Yes.  Tomorrow will be their first game of the new year, and Casey Walkup tells us their resolution  is to toughen up.  Cobra, the Thunder enters 2007 with an 11-14-2 record. 
[02:04:30]  That's 20 games out of first place.  Fuck off, Buzz.  So their new year's resolution is to simply win more games.  Do you hear me going, oh, oh.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He realized, I gotta hear that again, because he yells, fuck off, Buzz, of course.  Yeah.  And then you hear, like, he realized he was still on.  He's watching Home Alone.  He got really angry at Buzz.  2007 with an 11-14-2 record. 
[02:05:00]  That's 20 games out of first place.  Hey, fuck off, Buzz.  So their new year's resolution is to simply win more games.  Oh.  Oh.  How am I going to explain?  Oh, fuck.  That's actually audio from the first moon landing.  Because Buzz dropped a gasser, Buzz Aldrin, and Neil had to get off the rocket ship.  The rocket ship.  Yeah, he got a rocket ship.  The rocket ship.  Nine-year-old way to say it.  What are you, living cartoons?  A rocket ship.  Now, that could have also been that Buzz was trying to sneak out the door and be the first 
[02:05:30]  man on the moon.  And Neil pulls him back.  Hey, fuck off, Buzz.  Yeah, he was just about to get off, and Buzz went, you dropped something, and when Neil turned  around, Buzz cut a hole in his fucking suit.  He did the old step-a-rooning out in front of him.  One small step or fuck off, Buzz.  Yeah.  How funny would it have been, how great would it have been if Neil Armstrong, like, stepped  on the moon and stepped right in dog shit?  How confusing would that have been to the scientific community? 
[02:06:00]  Using some fucking multi-million dollar piece of equipment to pry the dog shit out of  the waffles in his shoes.  Yes, the waffles.  Because he doesn't want to smell up the capsule.  Well, Michael Collins won't let him get back on.  Get that off your feet.  Leave your moon boots on the fucking thing, and you're not getting back in the fucking  capsule, bucko.  You may be Mr. Fancy Moon Man to everybody else, but your shit feet kneel to me.  Take your shitty shoes and leave him there. 
[02:06:30]  What, is someone going to steal them?  They don't even realize when they first got back in the lunar module, him and Buzz are  just like, someone's stepping in dog shit?  And they don't look at Neil because there was no dog on the lunar module.  Of course not.  Or module.  Or module.  Module.  This is going great.  You're channeling Voss.  I love it.  Oh, that's fucking funny, man.  Oh, shit.  All right.  Why don't we move on to the next newsreader, Buzz?  Why don't we go to play again now? 
[02:07:00]  Oh, you're fucking funny.  Dude, something was happening.  I was in seven with an 11-14-2 record.  That's 20 games out of first place.  Hey, fuck off, Buzz.  So their New Year's resolution is to simply win more games.  Oh, fuck.  Oh, shit.  All right.  Yes.  That's fantastic.  You know what we got to end this with?  Oh, we got it.  Okay, good.  The anchor fight.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That's one of my favorites.  I love that one.  But first, this one out of Little Rock, Arkansas. 
[02:07:30]  What really happened on that Thursday here at Augusta High School  that led to Chris Wood's death?  The fuck is that?  Shit!  I'm dying in this fucking country-ass, fucked-up town.  Shit flying in my mouth.  The fuck?  I can't see pilot.  Let's get the fuck out of this country, motherfucker.  I can't see me.  So he sounds really, uh, quotations, white. 
[02:08:00]  Yes.  Something goes wrong and he goes all ghetto and starts sounding like Richard Pryor.  He did sound like Pryor, right?  That was, uh...  Or Richard Pryor.  Listen, listen...  Yeah, at the beginning, it's the same reporter.  So he's like, hello, yes.  I would almost think the guy's white.  What really happened on that Thursday here at Augusta High School that led to Chris Wood's death?  What the fuck is that?  What the fuck is that?  What the fuck is that?  Motherfucker.  All of a sudden it just turns into a motherfucker.  White people be crazy. 
[02:08:30]  Well, can't he just lunking in?  Is that it?  Yeah.  Holding two yogurts and his big dopey paws.  Big fucking paws.  Snowshoe feet.  You disheveled him last night.  Oh.  How?  He showed up, uh, at my building this morning all disheveled.  Well, we drove...  Are you okay?  I drove home so I wouldn't miss today. 
[02:09:00]  He was all happy.  No, I actually got three hours sleep.  I told him, look, why don't you just go to Opie's?  He's fucking right there, dude.  He's got eight bedrooms.  Yeah.  He is the weirdest dude ever.  He doesn't want to be a bother.  So what he did was, last night he went up to Hartford with Jimmy.  They did a show.  The second show went into what?  11?  No, I only did one show on Thursday.  Okay.  But they got home around 1 a.m., right?  Yeah.  And, uh, you know, he gets to my building around 5.  So there's four hours.  I told him, just fucking...  I mean, he's in the system. 
[02:09:30]  He has his own key, basically.  Just get the key and crash on my fucking couch.  Instead, he now drives another half hour home.  And then he has to drive the half hour back, obviously.  That would have been another hour of sleep he would have got.  So instead of getting four, four and a half hours of sleep, he gets three, barely.  Who, Mr. Fucking Do 80 until he's eight inches off the bumper and then jam on the brakes?  Oh, is that how he drives?  It's like fucking driving with a teacup ride at the carnival.  I'm like, would you fucking...  You have no...  He has the perspective of fucking...  Of something that doesn't have perspective. 
[02:10:00]  Whatever that creature may be.  Me and...  I missed an opportunity yesterday because Kenny drove Jimmy and I home.  And both of us got really carsick.  Like, I was this close to puking.  And I didn't have my experience, Anthony.  I gotta see that one day.  I wanna see how you go...  He's fucking...  The only person worse is my manager, Jonathan, who apparently has one, like, little fucking  papier-mâché foot and old Dudley Moore on the other side.  Kenny does the same thing.  Stop! 
[02:10:30]  Stop!  Every time we stop, I do this.  I do the job.  Back and forth, yeah.  Yeah, the bounce back and then forward real fast.  That's what makes you sick.  He's the worst.  We were so sick yesterday on the way home.  I felt terrific.  Yeah, drive.  I never feel sick.  Did he at least stay awake this time?  Yeah, he did.  That's nice.  We both took naps when we got there.  That's always a pleasure when he actually decides...  Starts dozing?  Dude, it is the most horrifying thing ever.  And then he still doesn't want to be a bother.  There was one time driving home from Boston.  I'm like, fucking get yourself to the side of the road. 
[02:11:00]  I'm driving.  Yeah, you're gonna kill us.  You think so?  Will that be?  Yes, Kenny.  I saw you sleeping.  Oh, I wasn't.  You were this close to snoring.  Resting my eyes.  Now, G.H., you're very gracious to invite me to your palatial...  What are you scared of?  ...apartment.  I told you.  You must have some weird sleeping habit or something.  Oh, there's gotta be something he does when he's sleeping.  I walk in my sleep and I talk in my sleep so I can't be responsible for what happens.  Maybe he has to have a nightcap on or something. 
[02:11:30]  Or he wakes up screaming, I want the black one on my ass.  Oh, shit.  The big black one.  Goes without saying.  How fat is Reverend Run going to get?  Jesus Christ.  I just saw on the news.  Oh, boy.  What happened?  He's not on TV, but he's...  The Reverend Run's a big man.  Oh, yeah.  He's got that reality show.  He's got the black Darth Vader.  Yeah.  Without the helmet.  Hey, Donald Pleasance.  Oh, it's Reverend Run.  And Jimmy did insist that I go to your apartment, too. 
[02:12:00]  I insisted.  Yeah.  Yeah, you did, too.  It's a fucking giant...  I'm like, dude, you can shower there.  There's extra bathrooms.  Yeah, I'm like, I got extra bathrooms.  I'm like, you're not even going to wake me up.  I won't even know you're there.  I was there.  Okay, Kenny.  Maybe he was.  I'll check the couch when I get home.  Here's another newsreader fucking up.  We got three to go here.  Another weather guy.  Right now, let's go outside and take a look.  Live look.  Sun is starting to set across the area in fucking beautiful condition. 
[02:12:30]  Although, you might...  Fucking beautiful conditions.  What are they thinking?  I don't know.  And then you might remember this one.  It's a quickie.  The season opens for Chicago.  White Sox has been put on ice.  Snow and high winds postpones.  So it has white cocks on the brain.  White cocks.  Yep.  And then we end with the ABC out of L.A. fight.  The anchor fight.  Oh, these two hate each other.  This is legendary. 
[02:13:00]  Oh, the guy and the girl?  Yeah.  This is 15 years old, but it's just worth playing again.  First segment.  It's done that way all the time.  Okay, yeah.  Just a little setup.  So obviously, they're getting ready to go live to do the news.  So, you know, all the mics and cameras and everything are rolling.  Yep.  And here's their little chit-chat just before the show.  First segment.  It's done that way all the time.  That's what I was told.  It frequently is.  It frequently is.  Well, then we better talk about it.  Do you hear me complaining about it?  Then we better talk about it.  Tonight I'm complaining because tonight I said hey.  Then we better talk about it because I think you've got a problem.  I agree.  I think we've got a problem. 
[02:13:30]  All right?  If that's what you think, then we'll talk about it after the show and we'll talk about  it with Roger Bell.  Because I'm not going to sit here night after night and put up with this shit.  Okay?  Night after night?  Night after night?  Well, it looks to me like that's the way it's going to go, Ann.  I'll take the ante up a little higher than that, even.  You're not only wrong, you're way out of line.  Let me tell you something.  You started it, pal.  You want Harold Green, you might get him.  That's fine with me.  Fine with me.  Oh, is it really?  Good old Harold Green. 
[02:14:00]  Okay.  Okay.  You want to start dealing with shit?  Go ahead.  That's what you want.  You just might get it.  You know, you go home and have a couple of shooters, and I don't know what the fuck happens,  but when you come back, you're not the same lady.  That's not true.  Some nights it is, Ann.  When news happens, you see it happen on Channel 7.  The number one station for news and information in Southern California. 
[02:14:30]  Now, Paul Moyer, Ann Martin, Johnny Mountainweather, and Todd Donahoe Sports.  This is Eyewitness News Tonight.  Three men dead tonight in an execution-style murder in Los Angeles.  Good evening, all.  Professionals right to the end.  He just goes right into it after calling her a drunk, which is great.  My favorite part of that now is the slamming of the papers.  He's stacking his papers like, look, you're a drunk fucking bitch. 
[02:15:00]  He's just piling them up.  Is there a video of that?  I wish.  I don't know.  The thing that's great, she's getting her ass kicked in this argument so bad.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Because he goes, night after night, and all she goes is, night after night, huh?  Huh?  She has no defense.  She knows he's right.  She's like, oh, fuck, they're on to me.  I do some fucking drinking.  And when she goes, yeah, you have the shooters, and you come back, and I don't know what the  fuck happens to you.  She's like, that's not true.  That's all she had. 
[02:15:30]  It wasn't like, you motherfucker, you're accusing me of drinking before I come on the job, you son of a bitch.  She's just like, that's not true.  What's a shooter?  Oh, my God, that's so true.  What's a shooter?  A few shots.  It's shots?  Yeah, a few shots.  Nice.  It's an old school expression for shots.  Yeah.  Shots of shooters, yeah.  Wow, that's like some hardcore shit, instead of maybe sipping on something.  Yeah.  A couple shooters.  He'd do a few shooters.  But he was about to get her in some shit.  Oh, yeah.  He's like, look, you want to take this upstairs?  You want to deal with that motherfucker? 
[02:16:00]  Harold Green.  Don't deal with Harold Green.  Jordan from Scranton writes, you want Harold Green, you might get him, and he's going to  rip your cunt.  Jesus.  When he said, you want Harold Green, you might get him.  She probably wanted to go, I really don't.  No, no.  I prefer not to.  Let's keep Harold out of this.  But she had to, in the argument, go, good, get him.  Good.  Get him.  Please don't get him.  That's like us hearing, well.  Please don't get him.  She wanted no part of Harold Green.  Harold's a prick. 
[02:16:30]  He's an insufferable prick.  Harold would have fucked the alcoholism right at him with a good firing.  Beat it, drunkard.  That's like when they come to us and go, well, if you want Mel Kormonson, you're going  to get him.  Yeah.  Oh, please no.  Bring it on.  No, no.  Anything but Mel.  Please don't.  No, no, no.  Please don't.  We'll talk to Mel.  We don't want to.  No, no.  We better not.  Please don't ask us to.  I don't think we've seen him in.  Yeah.  Maybe we should kick that upstairs and see what they think up there.  No, no, no.  You know something?  Do it.  Please don't do it.  I'm sorry. 
[02:17:00]  You're right.  I'm drunk.  Do it.  Unless you don't want to.  That's fine with me, too.  And I'd rather be that way, quite honestly.  All right.  We're going to break again.  The phone's lit.  Break, break, break, break, break.  God damn lit.  Break, break, break.  She's going loose.  Ah, whatever.  All right.  We'll figure out what the phones are doing after the break.  That smells delicious.  What type of yogurt is that?  Is that vanilla?  It's fucking, it's cool.  It's called, it's Dan and Light and Fit.  Mind your business flavor.  I'm an asshole.  I'm an asshole. 
[02:17:30]  Ah!  Yeah, so we got the KISS interview from WGAN.  I want to hear this because it just backs up everything everybody knows already, but that  I've been saying, and the reason I can't stand when, especially Gene Simmons comes in.  I know, Jimmy, now I know you're friends with Gene, and I wouldn't want to drag you into 
[02:18:00]  this, but I'm just saying, me personally, I am not a fan of Gene Simmons.  I'm not a fan of Gene Simmons either, Jimmy.  I'm Team Ace.  He just comes in.  I do love Ace.  Ace is the shit.  Ace is the place.  Oh!  Ace is coming back in.  The 25th, I believe we have him coming.  That was a little wordplay on my part.  It was very good.  Thank you.  Thank you.  No, even Ace doesn't like Gene.  He pretty much said it during the last...  Oh, Ace was on stage at the Viper Room, and he was talking to Tommy Thayer now, who's  doing Ace's job, has fucking some lightning bolts on his new costume, and Ace is on stage, 
[02:18:30]  and he goes, yeah, I saw the new Kiss costumes.  Tommy Thayer's got lightning bolts going down his leg.  Where the fuck did he get that idea from?  With that New York accent?  Yeah, why don't they do something original?  Ace is just the shit.  He doesn't care.  It's great.  He's coming back in.  Yeah, he's coming back in, though.  He's fucking...  And the way he plays...  He has a weird way of playing...  I can't...  Anthony could probably describe it, but usually you think of holding the guitar, the pick between 
[02:19:00]  your thumb and pointer finger, and playing it, but Ace has this really weird long...  His whole wrist bends into the guitar.  Oh, really?  He's bent, so it's almost like...  Yeah, I've seen that.  He's such a weird style, because he probably has really big fingers and a huge penis, which  might as well, I guess.  And he never looks like he's going to make it to the mic in time.  Dude, you've got to watch him.  I love that part.  It's like...  Back!  We're back!  He always...  Ace just kind of falls into it and lucks up.  It's the fucking... 
[02:19:30]  There's the mic there in front of me again.  I want to just run up and go, Ace, where are you going?  You have a lyric coming up in three seconds.  How about when he's walking away from the mic when the lyric is coming up?  That, that, that, that, that!  He's walking away and then kind of comes back.  Here it is.  In the back!  It's like, whoa, shit.  What's he doing?  What is...  Why are we getting emails from HR?  What?  Puffin' stuff.  What the...  I hate that guy.  He's your friend when things get rough.  No?  Yes.  Yes!  I am really going back on that one. 
[02:20:00]  So Kiss was on WGN.  And we noticed this a while ago.  Like, something happened with Gene where Gene would be a cool interview.  When we interviewed him at WNEW, it was a cool interview.  But then he would kind of promote all the Kiss stuff.  Ah, essentially.  Now it's an all-out.  But now it's a lot worse.  It's all out.  It's just about promoting.  And, you know, the interviewer is sitting there like, well, you're not giving us anything.  That's what these people are supposed to do.  They come in here.  You interview them.  They give you something that's worth it for the radio show. 
[02:20:30]  Give us a laugh.  A fun story.  Right.  And then we go, all right, what are you working on?  And then you get the word out that way.  Something from the past.  Right.  Anything.  But not with Gene Simmons.  No, no, no.  This is how it went down on WGN.  Joining us now from Los Angeles, Gene Simmons, Paul Stanley, Tommy Thayer, and Eric Singer.  Guys, good morning.  Good morning.  It's good to see you.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Hey, guys, am I wrong?  Are there a couple of names that are different from the Kiss I remember?  Well, you know, it depends on how far back you go.  But Eric's been playing with us off and on for 14 years. 
[02:21:00]  And Tommy's been with us about seven years.  So it's about as classic as I want to get.  And we finished the international part of the Kiss Alive 35 World Tour.  And we played to the biggest crowds, most successful tour we've ever done of stadiums.  And now we're back on home turf.  So here we are doing Kiss Alive 35.  And we'll be hitting United Center on November 6.  And the tickets go on sale September 26.  So we wouldn't miss it for the world. 
[02:21:30]  And you shouldn't either.  That's the warm-up club.  There's the plug.  But you notice that there was a legitimate question that turned into a plug.  Did Paul say we're doing this September 6 and the tickets go on sale September 26?  Did Paul give the worst plug in history?  Did he say that?  Yeah.  Is there a possibility we want you to have rid of that clip?  I could be wrong.  Joining us now.  A little forward through there.  Oh, that's good.  Come on.  I hope so.  I don't know.  Kiss has become a rock and roll infomercial. 
[02:22:00]  Very good.  We are doing Kiss Alive 35.  And we'll be hitting United Center on November 6.  And the tickets go on sale September 26.  November 6.  We wouldn't miss it for the world.  And you shouldn't either.  Yeah.  My fault.  I was hoping he fucked that.  Paul organically brings up some of the band's new projects.  Gene and Paul, you guys take time out for the Rosh Hashanah in the holidays?  You know, every day to us is a day to be thankful for what you have.  And, you know, Sonic Boom is coming out on October 6.  It is the first album we've done in 11 years. 
[02:22:30]  And it's a classic Kiss album with all the elements that people love.  Plus, it's packaged with 15 re-records of Kiss classics and a DVD from Buenos Aires, the stadium show we did there.  Oh, my God.  So, it's a Walmart exclusive.  And they made it possible for us to give this to our fans at a price which is less than you would pay for a single CD.  And they're also giving us these amazing Kiss Corners where you can get incredible exclusive Kiss merchandise in each city. 
[02:23:00]  It's a pretty special time for us.  This is like...  That was a Rosh Hashanah question.  First of all, they hit him with the Jew question, which is kind of funny.  It's like, you know, I don't think they like reminding people that they are of Hebrew descent.  It doesn't fit their rock and roll image, to tell you the truth.  This is an infomercial.  Yeah.  So, they're sitting there.  This is late night TV.  Ugh.  You want more?  Please!  Yeah, okay.  Sorry.  We're yelling. 
[02:23:30]  Gene Simmons finally pipes in.  Gene, we met Paul the other day when he came into our studios and we asked him,  did you think all these years later you'd still be wearing the makeup?  I mean, what do you think is the secret to the longevity of this band?  The secret is if you're going to dream, dream big.  It's as simple as that.  Reach for the sky.  Go for it.  And that's what Kiss is about.  A long time ago, we dreamt about putting together the band we never saw on stage.  Guess what?  We are going to be on stage.  Chicago. 
[02:24:00]  November 6th.  You want to see the best?  The greatest?  You're looking at them.  Wow.  You know something?  It all leads to a plug.  It's fucking disgraceful.  It's brilliant on his part.  He knows what he's doing.  It's disgraceful.  Have a little bit of fucking restraint.  Answer one question without tagging it with a fucking plug.  Tommy ends the interview with a quick and natural mention of their show in Chicago, which Paul helps with. 
[02:24:30]  Is there ever a point, though, where you go, I'm tired of putting this damn makeup on.  I look like a buffoon.  It's 8 o'clock in the morning, for crying out loud.  That ever come?  We always wear makeup.  It's just a regular thing.  All right.  Never mind then.  I'll solve that one.  But I wanted to add that at the United Center on November 6th, we're bringing in the biggest and the baddest KISS show there has ever been.  It's the biggest stage we've ever taken out.  We have a video screen and pyro and everything that's way beyond anything we've done before.  You know, in a time where money is hard to come by, you know, you can buy a high-priced ticket and see some guy sitting on a stool on a rug, you know, and they call it an intimate show. 
[02:25:00]  Well, when you come see us, you know where your money is because it's blinding you and deafening you.  No stools and no rugs, Larry.  You heard it here first.  Thanks, guys.  Thanks.  What was the date of that again?  November 6th?  November 6th.  Oh, see.  See, they're even like enough about November 6th.  Gosh.  Enough about November 6th.  Shut the fuck up. 
[02:25:30]  That's what I have to say to KISS.  Shut the fuck up.  I do not echo those sentiments at all.  Well, I know.  Jimmy Norton.  My favorite Gene Simmons moment ever.  My mat.  The banana moment was way up there.  Yeah.  But I have to go to Danny.  When Danny was pretty much.  Oh.  Yeah.  Pretty much stopped in his tracks.  Didn't he touch your arm to make you stop typing?  Didn't even look at him.  Didn't stop talking.  See, Gene is talking about something very important.  Absolutely. 
[02:26:00]  I don't know what it was.  Kiss fucking dildos.  Coffee or something.  Kiss coffee.  Yeah.  Kiss fucking false eyelashes.  Kiss shampoo.  I love those things.  And he's going off.  And now Danny, of course, the entire time is, Danny does research and pulls shit up during  the entire show.  So you'll hear like on the keyboard slightly.  Slightly.  And like, especially at the old studio, the mics picked up a lot.  Yeah.  And he was sitting like right next to me.  So I was even, you know, I'm conscious to that. 
[02:26:30]  So I was kind of trying to type, you know, lightly because I knew it was going to bleed  over a little bit.  And I guess that was even too much for Gene as he reached his hand kind of under my computer  monitor, like a flat monitor on a stand and just kind of touched my hand just as if to  say just, just, just for a few minutes.  And picture the way, the way he did it also was he was looking at me and Opie like back  and forth as he's talking about his products and all of his Kiss products.  And, and he did not stop doing that.  He didn't stop talking. 
[02:27:00]  He didn't stop looking directly at us.  Didn't acknowledge Danny.  Just moved his hand over and put his hand down on Danny's hand.  Like I'm, I'm talking.  Don't type.  Very softly.  Very softly.  Yeah.  Yes.  His hands are soft from counting money all his life.  Here's a problem.  Tie me a sheep shank.  You like to spit fire, don't you, Mr. Hooper?  Can we play the banana incident?  The banana incident?  Yeah.  I don't know about that one.  You do, Jimmy.  I don't.  That's a good one.  I'm just a generous guy.  This is, that is a good one. 
[02:27:30]  This is Jimmy, J-I-M-I, Gene Simmons and a banana.  I, how was it?  I gotta be, cause you know, roasting Gene was, was, you know, you think.  Can I take a bite?  Sure.  You can have the whole thing.  Um, I'll actually share it with you if you want.  You want it?  You just wanted to have a moment.  You'll share it with you if you want.  You stick it up your ass.  I'll eat it afterwards.  It reminds me of when I was in, uh, I think fourth or fifth grade, or no, seventh grade.  Billy, this kid, Billy Archer was, um, he was a, he was one of the tough guys around the neighborhood. 
[02:28:00]  Yeah.  He never bothered me, but we were all kind of scared of him, you know, he's like a burnout.  And, um, I remember one time, I might've even been in sixth grade, where he asked for a, like, he's like, you got a nickel?  And I just, I gave him a dime, and I'm like, um, I waited a few seconds, and I'm like, you don't have to pay me back.  Oh!  So I was hoping we'd bond over that.  Yeah, yeah, but you didn't.  I have to say not.  He, you don't bond with somebody who's shaking you down, is pretty much. 
[02:28:30]  Well, no, he actually was just asking me, like, you got a nickel?  Oh, he was?  Yeah.  And I was like, but then I told me you didn't have to pay me back.  You don't have to pay me back.  Easy come, easy go.  Yes.  I had it, and I went with it.  I had a dime.  Billy had a dime.  I had it, and you needed it?  I gave it to you.  We got Dave calling for the first time.  Dave, what's up?  Hey, how you doing?  Hey, Dave.  Hey, what's up, Jimmy the Weasel?  Hi, Dave. 
[02:29:00]  Anyway, I'm a first-time caller.  I'm a brother, and you can't tell already, and I really love the show.  I've been listening for a couple of weeks now.  Oh, wait, wait, wait.  Dave, you really love the show?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, wow, thank you.  What do you like about the Opie and Anthony show after, what, two weeks, I guess you're  saying?  A couple of weeks.  A couple of weeks.  What do you like about the Opie and Anthony show?  I love the honesty.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  The poor fucking guy.  But he's new, Opie. 
[02:29:30]  I know.  He's one of four black listeners.  I know.  We've alienated a quarter of our black listeners.  He's a new listener.  He doesn't understand the-  A little slow today, though.  He got the honesty part.  He wasn't even supposed to get that part out.  He doesn't understand the, you know, hey, what do you like about the show question?  Yeah.  I want to personally apologize to our newest and bestest half.  Newest and bestest half only. 
[02:30:00]  Young captain.  Young captain.  Breaking news.  Yes.  We got a new Guinness World Record, everybody.  Yes, we do.  Do we have our Guinness World Record breaking news?  Do we have a-  Of course you don't.  That was just-  Why would we?  Making everyone panic.  A towering Turk, Anthony, was officially crowned the world's tallest man Thursday after his Ukrainian  rival dropped out of the running by refusing to be measured. 
[02:30:30]  Why would you refuse to be measured?  Well, he tells you.  Oh, does he?  Yes, he does.  Really?  Where?  The tallest guy, this towering Turk, Ope, was 8'1".  Wow.  8'1"?  The tallest guy, though, his name is Leonard Stadnik, I believe.  He's from the Ukraine.  He's actually 8'5.5".  But Guinness said he was stripped because he declined to let anyone confirm his height.  He refused to be independently measured because he was tired of being in the public eye. 
[02:31:00]  Oh.  Well, Jesus.  He's like, he just wants to be away.  Yeah, he's sick and tired.  I just want to be a normal guy, just like I've always been when I was growing up.  Just a normal kid, never measuring except at the doctor's office, but I did everything  normal kids did.  How tall were you when you were in 6th grade?  6th grade?  How old is that?  About 12.  About 12?  Yeah.  I was actually 7 1⁄2 feet tall. 
[02:31:30]  I went through a growth spurt.  How do you lead a normal life if you're 7'5"?  What did you say?  7'5"?  Well, I was a normal kid.  Normal kid anyway?  I kicked around the soccer ball.  Yeah.  I would play with the other kids.  Yeah.  I would just have to duck when we were inside houses having parties.  Did you skateboard?  Things like that.  Yeah, I had a skateboard.  Yeah.  It was wonderful.  I had to take a surfboard and put wheels on it, but just like a normal kid, just an ordinary  kid.  I took Volkswagen axles and put them on surfboards, and I would skateboard with the normal kids. 
[02:32:00]  No one ever said anything.  No one looked at me for me.  Nothing.  It was wonderful.  Did you have a normal size bed?  No, actually, I had to put 16 beds side by side and end to end just to even be comfortable  because I had another growth spurt in my 16th year.  What happened then?  I reached the 8-foot mark.  8 foot?  Wow.  Yeah, I was 8 feet tall.  Wow.  Of that mark, yeah.  What stopped you from growing? 
[02:32:30]  Actually, I went to kill myself and accidentally shot my pituitary gland out of my head finally,  and my growth stopped.  Thank God, right?  I went to the prom, just like a normal kid, took a date with me.  How was that?  It was wonderful.  When we were nose-to-nose, her toes was in it, and when we were toes-to-toes, her nose  was in it, if you know what I mean.  See, I'm tall.  Is that his brother in the picture? 
[02:33:00]  I think so.  I love that Guinness World Record shit.  The end of the article is great because they talk about what his life is like, and he's  like, I can't fit into a normal car.  I can't go shopping like normal people, I have to have things made, and they're not  always fashionable.  Ceilings are low, and I have to bend through doorways.  But I love this.  He noted some advantages, too, including the ability to see people coming from far away.  The other thing is, at home, they use my height to change the light bulbs and hang 
[02:33:30]  the curtains.  Things like that.  Great.  What a plus.  How about looking over the top of bathroom stalls?  That's a good one.  Exactly.  There's not one advantage to being that tall.  None advantage.  I can see my friends coming 2.1 seconds faster than people with normal lives can.  Meanwhile, he can't drive in a car.  Yes.  But that's a plus, you know.  And he can't hide if he sees people coming who he doesn't want to see.  No.  What, do you put a leaf on your head and just pretend you're an oak tree, you fucking 
[02:34:00]  monolith?  Are you trying to say he would be bad at hide-and-seek, Jimmy?  Terrible.  Why?  Unless he was in the fucking redwood forest, then he'd be fine.  Hope they don't find me.  Yeah.  Hiding here behind a bush.  He'd be bad at everything, except fucking banging his head on the ceiling.  He's bad at everything, except going, ow.  That he's great at.  He's the fucking master of...  Excuse me.  Putting dents in door jams.  Oh, he's awful.  You know how many things he's kicked over with those fucking giant 14-inch feet? 
[02:34:30]  Lumbering feet and big fucking tall head.  I love how the big guys like this, how their fucking feet just buckle because the weight  is too much.  Yeah, yeah.  The weight's too much.  His ankles are a wreck.  They're crushing.  His ankles are crushed under the weight.  Eric's got the answer from Virginia Tech.  What stopped him from growing?  The ceiling.  Ba-da-ba-ba-da-ba.  Yeah.  I can only grow as big as my tank that I'm in.  Yeah.  And janitor pants trying to make up for yesterday.  Opie's sex advice from Fox News for World's Tallest Man. 
[02:35:00]  Danny, there's a link if you want to at least check it out and see if there's anything  to that.  Oh, let's go to Robert in North Carolina.  Robert?  Hey, gentlemen.  Hey, Robert.  I've been listening since I had to pay for it on XM, and Jimmy's banana comment gave me  the biggest douche chill I've ever had my entire fucking life.  I actually, in my car, just went out loud. 
[02:35:30]  Oh, no.  Sir.  I'm not lying.  Sir, why can't a sweet boy share a delicious fruit with one of his heroes?  Rude, all right.  Is the Tallest Man still in studio?  Share it with you.  Tallest Man still in studio?  Oh, what?  Because I think Larry King, a few Larry Kings are checking in.  Yeah.  Tallest Man in studio?  Uh-huh.  Let's say hi to Larry King.  He has a question for you. 
[02:36:00]  Larry!  Yes, um, Tallest Man, are you there?  Yeah, yes, Larry.  Do you play basketball?  Do you enjoy the basketball?  Well, I started playing basketball in the second grade with the high school students, and I  was slam dunking by the third grade.  And then by the fourth grade, all I had to do was stand there and drop it down into the  basket.  Over and over again.  Yes.  Would that be legal?  I was hitting my knees on the rim.  See, I'm tall. 
[02:36:30]  Sure is.  Get it?  Get it?  Get it, love happens.  Oh, the love happens commercial.  Look, look.  See, he's so confused.  Look at the love in their eyes, though.  She popped his gum.  He was blowing a bubble, and she popped his gum.  Oh, love happens.  She popped his bubble gum.  Oh, they're just walking through Seattle laughing.  Didn't they make a movie like that in Seattle already?  Of course they did.  He was blowing a bubble, and she took her finger and blew the bubble out with her finger. 
[02:37:00]  She popped his bubble.  That's love starting, folks.  How great would it be if she popped his bubble with her finger and he unloaded with a right  hook and fucking broke her eye socket?  Abuse happens.  Yeah, exactly.  Or no, she's just standing there with fucking like a mumps wrap on her head and two missing  teeth.  Mumps wrap.  Shit happens.  She went old school.  The big bow on top of her head. 
[02:37:30]  A mumps wrap.  Exactly, but it's got ice in it because he sucked the upper left-hand side of her dome.  He fucking back-knuckled her from popping his bubble.  We got advice for the tallest guy.  He should start a gutter cleaning company.  Ah, see, you could do that.  Oh, there's an old school picture.  Let's play mumps.  What was the mumps?  Why would they tie that around the kid's head?  Boy, how fucking old is that?  Mumps.  He's got the mumps.  So old, that.  Uh, why would they tie the thing around your head? 
[02:38:00]  Like, I know your mumps would, like, make you get jowls.  Like, you'd be like, it was all the glands in your jaw and cheeks all blowing up in your  neck.  It was probably to put ice there and hold the ice.  How else do you hold ice?  It didn't look like ice.  It looked like they just had, like, a diaper tied around their head.  I don't even know.  Fucking mumps.  It's an old wives' tale.  Maybe it hurt because it was hanged down.  So that kind of holds it up.  Yeah.  Yeah, it works like jockey shorts. 
[02:38:30]  Maybe it just looks nice.  For the balls that are growing off your fucking jowls.  Let's say hi to Larry King.  Larry!  Larry!  Good morning.  Good morning, Larry.  The question for the world's tallest man.  Is he still here?  Yeah, he's still here.  Yes, Larry.  Do you keep kickables in your pocket?  Can't even see him.  Squish him like ants, Larry.  Larry.  Nothing funny for that.  That was good.  No, it wasn't.  Larry King checking in.  Larry.  Larry King.  I don't like doing skits with the listeners. 
[02:39:00]  Of course.  This is when you say, yes, Larry.  Yeah.  Like you guys are in on the same fucking improv troupe.  Here we go.  All right.  Now I'll tag you and you freeze.  Shut up.  Yes.  Is it because you're so tall?  Because you're Negroes.  That old gag.  Because you're Negroes?  Because you're Negroes.  Fucking Larry.  He's just crazy.  Maury's hair is a very comfortable color for a man of his age.  Oh, yeah.  We called him out on that.  Holy shit.  And then he toned it down for a while.  Yeah, but now I'm back.  It's like gentle suede walnut. 
[02:39:30]  Is that what it says on the box?  Yeah.  It really is more appropriate on a wood surface.  Yeah.  Like a nice shiny cabinet.  He should be washing his hair with fucking something that cleans wood.  Cocksucker.  I can't think of a wood cleaner.  Murphy's wood soap.  Murphy's Earl.  It's Lemon Pledge.  Yeah, it's Lemon Pledge.  Exactly.  What's some of that other wood stuff we got?  As I started, I realized I have no wood products.  Minwax.  Yeah, really.  Minwax.  Didn't give a lot to work with there. 
[02:40:00]  All right.  Let's go to Larry King, Anthony.  Larry.  Hello, Larry.  Mr. King.  Larry.  Yeah, whatever Larry King is there, just say something.  Yeah, Larry.  Larry's hard of hearing.  Well, Larry wanted to ask you, Tallest Man, does the Tallest Man wear hefty bags as condoms?  If he didn't leave, I'm sure he would have said yes.  Hefty bags as condoms.  Yeah.  Skits with the listeners.  It's fun.  It's fun. 
[02:40:30]  Come on.  We're improv-ing.  Get into it a little bit.  No.  Please.  I hate it.  Get into it a little bit.  I hate it.  What's the Turk's name?  Hold on.  The Turk's name?  Yeah, you have to have a name in everything.  The Turk.  What is his name?  Sultan Kassin.  Yeah, that's your new name, Ant.  But if he's a Turk, he would sound different.  Satan Kassin.  I'm the Turk.  Anthony, Larry King's checking in.  He wants to talk to the world.  You make that deal.  Tallest Man.  Yeah.  If the old man dies, you make the deal. 
[02:41:00]  Is he the Turk?  No.  I didn't even care.  You think too much of me, kid.  That would have been it.  Larry.  Mind if me and Michael speak Italian?  Hello.  Hey.  Hi, Larry King.  Could you explain why you're the biggest man in that village and there's always both-legged  women walking around?  Okay.  High five.  That was Larry King?  Yes, it was.  You're going to...  Hey, just think of it this way. 
[02:41:30]  Think of the upside.  You'll definitely hear yourself saying that again at some point once Travis gets done with  volume two.  Congratulations, sir.  Congratulations.  You made it.  That joke should have been dropped out of the Enola Gay.  All 300, infantry.  You made it.  Well, we're going to switch gears, Danny.  What's this deposition thing about?  Depositions are supposed to be very private.  They are.  And this gentleman was being videotaped and they had some odd questions for him. 
[02:42:00]  And this was found on, I believe it was the Huffington Post this morning.  I'll get more backstory as we listen to the clip so I can properly explain this.  Okay.  Do you solemnly swear the testimony you're about to give away the truth, the whole truth,  and nothing but the truth to help you guys?  Yes, I do.  Could you please give us your name?  Jeffrey Epstein.  Is it true, sir, that you have what's been described as an egg-shaped penis? 
[02:42:30]  What the fuck?  What is that?  An egg-shaped penis.  How the fuck?  Keep fucking those chickens.  He's a disgraced money manager and former Clinton associate.  This is a deposition earlier this month.  He was there because he's facing a claim from a 15-year-old girl who says, among other things,  that he promised to pay her $200 for a massage.  Oh, no.  Oh, his nickname was Old Omelette Shorts. 
[02:43:00]  That's right.  With him, when he fucks, it's not rape, it's a poaching.  I hope you like yours runny.  That's right.  That's what he says when he's about to cum.  I'm going to scramble your pussy.  Fucking awful.  The girl was too young to realize that it was cum and not egg whites.  Oh, oh, boy.  Yeah, she's just an egg white omelette.  Here you go.  He pulls his dick out.  He's got little bits of ham and fucking onion on it.  Easter's fun. 
[02:43:30]  Hey, fucking vinegar smelling balls.  How do you have an egg-shaped dick?  He puts it in a slipper and a kid grabs it.  He hides it.  I get it.  Yes, we get it.  Let's continue.  Make like your dick and beat it.  Is it true, sir, that you have what's been described as an egg-shaped dick?  But it don't fall down?  Yes.  Sorry.  Is it true that your dick once sat on a wall and had a great fall? 
[02:44:00]  Is it true that your dick stands up straight on the summer solstice?  Is it true, sir, that you have what's been described as an egg-shaped penis?  Form, vague, indefinite.  And I'm going to give you the first warning, Mr. Koobin, that these types of questions are not only argumentative,  but directed in a manner to embarrass Mr. Epstein. 
[02:44:30]  If you continue with this type of question, I'll adjourn the deposition immediately.  All right.  Sir, according to the police department's probable cause affidavit,  one witness described your penis as oval-shaped and claimed when erect,  it was thick towards the bottom but was thin and small towards the head portion.  Oh, that's fucking great.  Oh, what a fuck. 
[02:45:00]  He's got a rocket penis.  Did the Egyptians build your penis and leave it in the desert?  He's got a rocket ship for a penis.  He does.  Jesus.  Oh, how embarrassing.  A big, fat base and a little teensky head.  Is your penis shaped like Kenneth Fetter?  It's a soft, egg-shaped penis, and then it gets hard, and it's a fucking drill.  Why don't we go to Tim in Georgia?  Tim, you got something on this?  Yeah, I was just going to say that massage didn't go over easy. 
[02:45:30]  Oh!  What came first, the chicken or your penis?  That was actually one of the comments in the FARC thread.  Was it?  Yeah.  That's right.  I would not eat your penis and ham.  I would not eat it, Sam-I-Am.  When women suck your penis and they always rub toast over it first,  we'd like an answer, sir.  These questions are guaranteed to embarrass my client, Chicken Little.  There's no reason to ask this.  Would your penis look natural on a plate at Denny's? 
[02:46:00]  Did you give her the old grand slam?  Here's a great line.  No credit, because I don't have a name with this one.  He wanted to bang her ass, so he turned her over easy.  You want to hear that description again?  Oh, God.  More than I want anything.  Described your penis as oval-shaped and claimed when erect,  it was thick towards the bottom but was thin and small towards the head portion  and called it egg-shaped.  Those are not my words.  I apologize.  But as Mr. Critton has stated, that this is a... 
[02:46:30]  Court is now adjourned.  I'm willing to continue.  I'm willing to continue.  Wow.  That judge, uh...  What the fuck?  I guess the judge was just like, Court adjourned.  Judge is getting a rod.  He didn't want to...  He wants to get down there and eat some eggs.  He wants to see what that looks like.  Who is old egg dick?  I have to see him.  They're calling him old traffic cone cock.  That's hilarious.  That's the guy?  Does your penis look like a candy corn? 
[02:47:00]  Holy shit.  Fuck it, his little teeny head.  He's an egg-shaped penis.  Egg-shaped.  Of all the things, did Mark from Ork live in your penis?  Bruce.  Yeah, is it true that your head is shaped like Club Soda Kenny's head?  Your head.  No, it's your penis.  It's shaped like Club Soda Kenny's head.  I already said that.  Another one for the bombs.  Save that one, Travis.  And he's repeated by joke that fuck.  Yeah.  You dig that Club Soda Kenny's head? 
[02:47:30]  Yes.  I said Kenny.  Yeah.  You said Kenny.  Yeah, okay.  I'm sorry.  Ooh, that bastard.  Wow, that's fucking funny, man.  You can't do anything sexually illegal if you have an odd penis.  No.  You really can't.  Because you don't want to be identified by your weird penis.  Your weirdo penis.  Like fucking Michael Jackson had a goddamn leopard penis.  Spots on it, right.  This guy's got fucking Vostok rocket. 
[02:48:00]  What did he say?  It's thick at the bottom and gets smaller.  Smaller.  Thin and small.  Toward the head area region.  He's a big fat dick at the base.  Let's go to Mike.  Attaboy.  What a great find by Danny.  Mike, what do you got, buddy?  Yeah, I heard this guy would pre-ejaculate when he got very egg-cited.  All right.  At least he laughed funny.  Funny Lee.  Yeah, he went for the very good fuck. 
[02:48:30]  Damn, that's funny, man.  Egg penis.  And then pointy penis when it got hard.  I must have freaked the girl out.  She wasn't very experienced.  Oh, here's...  This guy wants to know.  Sean in North Carolina.  Sean.  Yes, sir.  Is it true that your penis wobbles, but it won't fall down?  That's what I said.  Do you have a penis shaped like a punching bag?  I never hear these things.  No one hears nobody.  Did Rocky drink your penis for protein? 
[02:49:00]  All right.  That's good.  Yes.  That is a good one.  Did we do enough time so we go to break?  We did.  We did?  Yeah.  All right.  I would say so.  You want to hear the manhole thing one more time?  Dynamite show.  I want to hear the manhole thing one more time.  Yeah, that was a good one.  Kind of a little concept.  Yeah, that's a good one.  Channel for SiriusXM.  The channel would be called Manhole, and it'd be a lot of broads talking very edgy. 
[02:49:30]  What's with these lights?  Do they have a brain tumor?  I felt it, too.  Do they just blink?  Yeah, it does.  What?  Are they getting dim and red?  Do you smell burning hair?  Is that what happens sometimes when a stroke?  I think so.  That's what you always hear on.  You smell burning hair?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Imagine if the lights go out in your house and you burn your hair and just think you're having a stroke.  Go to the hospital.  That would be weird.  Sure would be.  Especially if they were all having it at the same time.  Yeah.  You were too busy rubbing lotion on your egg dick. 
[02:50:00]  Trying to make it pointy.  Eggie wax.  Yeah.  All right.  We'll do the manhole promo.  This is what the channel would sound like if they took our idea.  Today on The Manhole, extreme guy talk done by women.  Catch Rita and Janice in the labia lounge.  All right.  Look who's coming into the studio.  It's Cherry and Melissa, the lesbian exhibitionist.  Hi, girls.  Ooh, Cherry, what is that you brought with you?  This is my favorite vibrator, the rabbit. 
[02:50:30]  Oh, my God.  Is that the one Samantha has in Sex in the City?  It so is.  I heard they're making another movie.  I can't wait.  I can't wait to see Carrie's shoes.  I know.  I can't wait to see what this Samantha says next.  I wonder what's going to happen to Miranda's boyfriend so cute in the last movie.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Those bitches sure can't babble.  Catch Rita and Janice today in the labia lounge, 3 p.m. Eastern on The Manhole. 
[02:51:00]  All hole, all the time.  We're going to be checking out the football games this weekend, Ant.  Football season started.  How about you take a little break from the Yankees?  There's some good games on this weekend.  Why would I take a break from the Yankees?  We got the Pats and the Jets going at it.  Come on.  I might peek in on the Pats and Jets. 
[02:51:30]  That's got to be a good look, no?  But, no, I'm pretty much sticking to just watching the Yankees.  Ten games, magic number, ten.  And Boston lost last night, which was good.  Yankees had the night off.  They're playing tonight, though.  And the magic number's ten.  Ten.  Well, that's dumb.  Why?  Because obviously they're going to do it at this point.  Well, no, I've seen teams fuck up, believe me.  And we've seen the Yankees fuck up.  Well, they're comparing them to the 1998 Yankees now. 
[02:52:00]  They certainly are.  I don't know this, and hopefully you do.  Yes.  Do the Yankees have a chance of having the best record ever for the organization?  For the Yankee organization?  Yes.  I believe they might.  How many wins they got?  Like 92?  I'm not sure.  No, they got more than that.  Really?  Yeah.  They're going to have 100 wins this year?  What are the stats?  I think the 98 Yankees.  I think you've got to go to stats on the Yankees.  98 Yankees.  Didn't they do about 100?  They had 114.  What?  It says nowhere near 98 Yankees. 
[02:52:30]  See, the thing is, this season the Yankees had a shaky start, which is the problem.  Remember the beginning of the season?  Ugh.  Yeah, it was pretty bad.  It was pretty bad.  Weren't they right around 500 or something?  But then they stepped it up, and now...  Wait, the Yankees won 114 games?  Yeah, they're really, really...  And the Yankees got, what, 94 wins now?  52 losses, did I see?  53.  52-53.  So if they did six and another nine, 15, they could do, right? 
[02:53:00]  They lost 48 in 98.  Yeah.  Wow.  All right.  But, you know, like I said, they had a bad beginning of the season, so that fucked them  for a record.  But, I mean, shit.  They have been really amazing.  Margaret Cho just walked by the studio.  Is that her?  Really?  Really?  Wow.  BFD.  Big fucking dyke?  Was it her?  Of course not. 
[02:53:30]  Oh, I thought it was really.  Just someone that might have looked like her.  Just such a dick.  And Jimmy's Cowboys playing the Giants this weekend.  Did the Cowboys win their first game?  I don't even know.  They did, yes.  Did they look good?  They got a shot this year, Jimmy?  In the replay.  I didn't want to.  I have not paid attention.  No?  Nah.  I mean, I'm not paying attention to sports.  At all.  Even football now?  What happened with football?  Jimmy's a busy man now.  I just got bored with sports because every athlete we've interviewed has been a fucking 
[02:54:00]  douchebag.  Yeah?  None of them are funny.  They all sit there with an attitude.  I'm just fucking sick of all of them.  Or almost all of them.  Almost.  UFC guys I love.  That'll change if they get popular.  Well, Liddell's already popular, man.  Rampage is just a different vibe.  Aren't they doing UFC 103 this weekend?  Yeah, they're different in Dallas.  Just they're not like...  In Dallas?  Because Dana's Dana.  It's who it rolls downhill.  They're animals.  They're not fucking like that jock mentality.  They have a killer mentality.  Absolutely right.  Yeah, it's different. 
[02:54:30]  As far as movies go this weekend?  Oh, don't have to tell me.  Love Happens.  20% on RottenTomatoes.com.  20%?  I'm outraged.  That is a bust.  I'm so outraged.  Why don't we get anybody from that movie on our show?  We haven't had a guest on the show in like three weeks, I think.  Good.  I like Steve Leeds and I like Liam.  Okay.  Very much.  That's good.  All right.  Warren, what's happening with our guests?  I don't know.  Maybe the other two people that work in the department have something to do. 
[02:55:00]  I don't know.  Honestly, not sure.  Oh, well, the gossip is just boiling over here on the Open Energy Show.  Speaking of gossip.  Oh, well, I wonder what that means, Jim.  I know what it means for me.  A big dick in my ass tonight.  And that will be gossip.  That'll be the truth.  Yeah.  Cloudy with a chance of meatballs.  What the fuck is this movie about? 
[02:55:30]  A 3D cartoon.  Is it really?  Yeah.  About, I think it starts raining like food.  There's some kind of thing where it rains food.  91% on RottenTomatoes.com.  91?  Who are the voices in this one?  I don't know.  Usual Suspects?  Yeah.  Is it?  Who knows?  All right.  And then The Informant.  That's the Joel McHale movie.  He's in that?  He's in that one.  66% positive reviews.  And what do you know on The Informant? 
[02:56:00]  Well, I know it's, uh, uh, who the fuck's in there?  Who's the star of that one?  That would be, uh, Matt Damon.  Who?  Matt Damon.  Matt Damon.  Matt Damon's in that one.  Matt Damon, Joel McHale, and the dude from Hangover with the tiny penis that me and Jimmy  met in the hallways here at SiriusXM.  Ken Young?  Very cool guy.  And it turns out he's a fan of the show.  Wait.  Why isn't he on our show?  Yeah, why isn't he on, man?  He's got to be doing press in New York.  Coming out?  Apparently, uh, the trailer looks kind of funny.  I don't know.  Matt Damon's an informant, and he's really kind of bad at it, but it looks funny. 
[02:56:30]  I really made it sound good.  Look.  We kind of need some help around here.  We can't do everything.  Could the company help us out just a little bit?  You gotta help me!  Could you help me?  Did you ever hear the elevator prank call?  Hmm.  No.  Colin Cain, a young comedian, tweeted it last night, and I don't remember hearing it.  What is it?  The fucking guy's pissed off. 
[02:57:00]  His elevator is fucked up.  And he's calling the company and just goes off.  It sounds so much like it's a Jerky Boys call, but it's not.  Like old school good Jerky Boys?  I think it was on E-BOM.  E-BOM.  Well, E-BOM.  E-BOM.  And Jennifer's body, Anthony.  Do you know anything on this one?  37% positive reviews?  No.  Okay, that's good.  That means Megan Fox.  She's like some evil vampire.  Oh, right.  Okay.  I did see the trailer for that.  Does she show her snitch? 
[02:57:30]  I just lost it.  A lot of skin now.  I had no idea what it was about.  What kind of skin?  What kind of skin?  Rawr.  Rawr.  And Michael Jackson's mom is getting $86,000 a month to care for the kids.  Holy shit.  What could...  Does that bother you?  No.  You know something?  Whatever.  Someone has to watch the kids.  Watch the kids.  86 G's a month.  That's some nice cage.  You know what, though?  I'll watch him for 10.  That guy was worth so much money dead to that family. 
[02:58:00]  Yep.  Yeah.  They are kind of despicable.  And then you got Curb Your Enthusiasm with the whole Seinfeld thing starting up Sunday.  Let's not forget.  DVR that.  I'm DVRing the shit out of that.  Yeah.  Can you actually DVR the shit out of something?  Yeah.  You can, right?  Done it.  And finally, Jimmy brought it to our attention.  Music industry...  This drove Jimmy nuts during the break.  Music industry wants royalty fees for the 30-second previews of songs that we all get on iTunes. 
[02:58:30]  Why?  That's what makes you buy the songs sometimes.  That's very out of touch to do that.  That's crazy.  Because that's how you get turned on to stuff, and then you buy the music.  What, are you just going to use that?  Are they afraid you're just going to, like, somehow have those on your iPod?  And have a real quick dance party?  Yeah.  Club opens at 8, closes at 8, 8 in 30 seconds.  Bow, bow, ticka, bow. 
[02:59:00]  Get home safe.  Can anyone explain why they need that money?  Why that's important?  It doesn't make sense.  I don't know.  There's, like, supposedly some big hat shortage in the music industry, and they figure that  they need extra royalties.  You know, Ellen DeGeneres is getting sued for all the music she's used on her show.  Well, yeah, her show.  She was using it a lot.  I heard that they wanted money, and they said, we don't roll like that, like, to get them  set.  That was, I honestly...  Someone actually said, we don't roll like that.  That was the response from Ellen's show about getting, like, permission or some shit. 
[02:59:30]  But can we just break it down?  Break it down.  If Ellen DeGeneres is playing some song that's new, or maybe a song you haven't heard in a  while, that audience that watches her show is being turned on to that music and now going  and buying those tunes, right?  It's like a commercial.  It's great exposure for the artists and the record companies.  I don't get that.  I don't understand that.  Well, they're executive guy types.  They don't really look at the big picture. 
[03:00:00]  What's going to end up happening is she's going to use music that no one knows or something,  you know, and that's going to be the trend.  And so then the music industry fucks themselves over.  Garage band loops.  Just do that.  She could just dance to those.  Some indie rockers.  Well, that's just crazy, but this world is absolutely nuts at this point.  Oh, it's money hungry.  By the way, I'm just, as we're talking, Maury has his collar up and he's talking to the  ugliest couple in America with walnut colored hair.  Can we have, I want to hear the trailer for fucking Love Happens because they were showing 
[03:00:30]  a promo, a fucking trailer for it.  A pro, a pro, a pro, a trailer for it.  Oh boy.  And it just looked abysmal.  Yeah, find the trailer because it is a typical chick flick, one of these horrid, lovey movies  that are all the same.  They're all the same.  Wait, are we getting the elevator prank call too?  Love.  And the guy, love happens. 
[03:01:00]  Love.  Sometimes when you're least expecting it.  Yep.  That's it.  Love happens.  Love happens.  What happened to the elevator thing?  He's a, she's a, in the end, love that.  What's about your computer, Dan?  All right.  What the, Dan from Ohio, leave Ellen alone.  Best comedian ever.  Why can't you guys get her on your show?  We haven't trashed Ellen. 
[03:01:30]  No, I actually think Ellen's very funny.  Take it easy, Dan.  Leave Ellen alone.  Silly goose.  She is funny.  Best comedian ever?  No.  No, no, no.  Richard Pryor, George Carlin.  Yakov Shmiernoff.  Oh, Sinbad.  Wow, we were in the same place at the same time.  Yakov.  Right there, my friend.  Yep.  Billy Bats.  Billy Bats.  Can't find it?  He's funny with the Billy Bats with the book.  Paul Bond.  Paul Bond.  The men book.  Oh, yeah.  Talking to myself.  We were bringing up Billy Bats in his book. 
[03:02:00]  I saw Paul Bond in fucking Wildwood.  It's just fucking rock, dude.  It's all fucking good.  Excuse me.  You saw Paul Bond?  Oh, okay.  Getting back to the music thing.  Ope, you're right on.  The Final Sopranos.  Well, he wrote it this weird, so let me figure this out.  The Final Sopranos.  Okay, yeah.  Sent Journey sales through the roof with Don't Stop Believin' in the final scene.  Remember that?  No one was fucking buying that song for years.  Sales went crazy.  Except maybe really, really hardcore Journey fans, whatever.  And the sales went nuts because of the exposure on a hit show. 
[03:02:30]  Exactly.  So how dare fucking these record companies sue the Ellen DeGeneres show and whatnot?  It's bullshit.  How dare they?  How dare you, sir?  Oh, Harrison Ford yelling at the president.  Of course, yelling at the president.  How dare you, sir?  That reminds me of the movie I'm writing.  Oh, what is that?  It's this thing where it's about a bowling alley where all the bowling balls got bombs in them.  Wow.  Yeah. 
[03:03:00]  That's crazy.  It's called Bombs Alley.  Yeah, I bet it is.  And they got it.  Dan from Ohio wrote back, while you enjoy that bomb.  Dan writes sarcasm.  Sorry, I think she sucks.  So Dan was never a fan.  Dan fooled us.  You know we do winky eye when someone's being a real fucking asshole, but then the winky 
[03:03:30]  guy's like, look, I'm on your side.  I'm just fucking around.  Yeah.  We need a new one for sarcasm on instant feedback and what you're looking at in front of you.  It's like an S followed by an A-R-C and then a dashasm.  Yeah, that might work.  That's subtle.  Oh, Dan's computer is just being the bitch, isn't it?  How come you love this computer so much when it's always crashing?  Love happens.  Bomp, bump, bump.  We got it?  Is this the elevator prank? 
[03:04:00]  I want to hear it buffer.  No, this is...  Is it buffering?  This is the trailer for Love Happens.  It's out for a little review.  Burke Ryan.  I'm feeling okay.  How are you?  Motivational speaker.  This is your moment.  TV, radio, publishing.  Like Leargetts?  You know that's not why I wrote it.  You do know that you're helping people.  What's wrong?  So tell me, what motivated the book?  My wife died three years ago.  Never intended for her to actually read it. 
[03:04:30]  The only thing separating you and me is your head.  The great line would have been, what did she die of?  She was fucked to death by a bull master.  It's a freak accident.  She was in a rush and she got her vag lips caught in the elevator door.  How did your wife die?  Linger longer.  Well, my wife, what a buzzkill.  She's just trying to take his picture.  Jennifer Aniston is the photographer and she's taking pictures.  She's a very successful motivational speaker. 
[03:05:00]  She's writing books to self-help things and she's now doing a photo shoot with him.  And they start talking to each other.  And, you know, I wonder what's going to happen.  I think love.  But then she goes, what happened to your wife?  Well, she died mysteriously right after I took out that big policy on her.  I was out with no alibi and some men broke in and shot her and stole nothing.  It's amazing.  I had defensive wounds on my face and hands.  It was from a squirrel in the park who attacked me. 
[03:05:30]  Coincidentally, that day, yes.  Yes, love happens.  Let's see what happens when love happens.  When two people with engorged genitals meet on a roof, love happens.  One with a tranny neck, love happens.  One with a cleft chin and one with a tranny neck.  The blood is a-flowing.  Let's hit this.  Shumped into each other.  Would you like to have a cup of coffee? 
[03:06:00]  Wow.  I have never been on a date with someone who has a cardboard cutout of themselves.  It's really good for the carpool lane.  Pause that, please.  Get it?  I like that one.

[03:19:00]  Let's at least think about it  That is every  Bad fucking  Love movie  Terrible  It's every single one of them  There's no original thinking  When it comes to these  Stupid chick flicks  And these broads  Go see these things  In droves  You watch this movie  You'll do great  Because all the  Fucking bitches  Will drag their  Castrated  Fucking husbands  And boyfriends to it  20%  On Rotten Tomatoes  Doesn't matter  Yeah well  They know  It's rotten  But the  Bitches don't know  I'd rather see the  Fucking  Story with the
