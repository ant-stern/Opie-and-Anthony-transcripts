<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show begins with Opie recounting a violent underwater altercation with a French couple in Turks and Caicos, escalating to a punch after repeated accidental collisions.  A caller then shares a similar underwater conflict.  Comedian Lenny Clarke calls in, discussing his new TV show, health struggles, humorous anecdotes involving Elizabeth Hurley, and a memorable massage therapist.  Former Universal Studios tour guide Rick follows, relating amusing and often inaccurate behind-the-scenes stories about the Jaws, King Kong, and other exhibits, also touching on the growing problem of illegal DVD piracy.

The show continues with a discussion of a seemingly unremarkable Universal Studios tour, focusing on underwhelming movie props.  This transitions to a phone interview with Ted Demme, director of *Blow*. Demme discusses the film's production, casting (Johnny Depp, Paul Reubens, Bobcat Goldthwait), his perspective on George Jung, drug sentencing, and Hollywood's formulaic filmmaking. He also shares anecdotes about his Long Island upbringing. The segment includes tangents on excessive home videotaping and features topless Bacardi bartenders serving drinks in the studio.  The conversation then shifts to Mike Tyson, playing audio clips of his rambling speech, speculating about his mental state and Zoloft's role.  Tyson's unpredictable behavior is jokingly compared to various movie monsters. A caller identifying as "Mike" offers a possibly facetious interpretation of Tyson's comments.  A song parody about Reverend Al Sharpton, referencing his Sudan trip, is played, followed by more Tyson audio and commentary. Black Earl briefly calls in, sounding ill.

The show delves further into Mike Tyson and his Zoloft use, accompanied by sexually explicit and offensive jokes.  The hosts speculate on Tyson's potential for violence if he stopped taking the medication, comparing him to Gorgo. A fictional, comedic portrayal of a Mike Tyson call-in features absurd and offensive statements.  Andrew Dice Clay, Jim Norton, and Kimmy from *Survivor* are in studio.  The conversation is dominated by crude sexual banter between the hosts and guests, including discussions of sexual acts and body parts. Dice Clay contributes his vulgar humor and storytelling, while Kimmy's presence leads to discussions about her personality and *Survivor* experiences, often intertwined with sexually charged remarks. Allison, the "best ass contest" winner, and Stalker Patty are also mentioned; Patty eventually calls in, resulting in more sexually charged commentary.  The segment concludes with news about Ronald Reagan's declining health and Alzheimer's.

The show features a prank call to a Ronald Reagan impersonator, who engages in highly vulgar and sexually explicit conversation, making crude remarks about himself, Nancy Reagan, and other political figures.  The conversation includes ageist, sexist, and ableist jokes. The segment then shifts to a pre-arranged meeting between a female caller, Anna (later revealed to be a transsexual woman), and a duct-taped and blindfolded staff member nicknamed "Psycho Mark."  Anna performs a lap dance and other intimate acts while Mark is restrained; the hosts narrate with explicit language and sexual jokes.  Anna's male and female voices, her plans for gender confirmation surgery, and her work in the adult entertainment industry are discussed. The segment concludes with more sexually explicit commentary and jokes.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Today, you're stuck with the worst of O.B. and Anthony.  1027 WNEW  Take your ball, but take it out now!  Look what I did to you, again!  The traffic message.  I got sort of a kind of warning. 
[00:00:30]  It's time to be sad.  I see your legs coming.  Shut up, bitch! That's funny!  All right!  Wow!  That's a winner! 
[00:01:00]  That's a winner!  Oh, lookie, lookie here!  Oh, lookie, lookie here!  That's a winner. 
[00:01:30]  Looky, looky here.  Good morning.  Good morning, Arnold.  Good afternoon.  I'm doing good, Arnold.  Now we're having fun.  Yes, we are.  212-757-1027 is our phone number.  It's the O&A Show.  We are live back from vacation on this first day of winter.  I'm teasing.  Kidding, of course.  Just getting back from our Christmas break.  Had a little problem.  Should have been back three or four days.  Anyone else getting deja vu?  Yeah. 
[00:02:00]  Because people don't know when we're live or on tape anymore.  Yeah.  So we put together such a great desktop show.  We should do a vacation break.  Tell everyone what we did.  Went on separate vacations.  Yes.  Yes.  And did the cruise thing.  I went on the cruise.  And I did the Club Med thing.  Mm-hmm.  Down in Turks and Caicos.  A great spot.  I just hope he's into scuba diving.  Oh, you want me to tell that story right off the bat?  You're a big scuba diver now.  All right.  I'll tell the scuba diving one. 
[00:02:30]  Turks and Caicos.  This is going to help the psycho factor in my head bit.  I can't believe you.  Yeah, I went to Turks and Caicos because I wanted to do some diving.  I dove all week.  I'm a beginner diver.  I only have about ten dives under my belt.  So I'm not going to act like I'm Jacques Cousteau or anything.  I had to go diving with...  What, dead?  Yeah.  I'm no Jacques Cousteau.  I agree.  So one day, I just want to start this little story by saying French people suck. 
[00:03:00]  Ah.  Hate them.  It's very international when you go away like that.  A lot of people from a lot of countries.  And they should talk their girlfriends into shaving their armpits.  That's acceptable in here.  That's what you want to see on a Club Med vacation.  French girls with big, gnarly, sweaty, black underarm hair.  Man, that's attractive.  And you can only imagine if that looks like that.  But what is...  Whoa.  Yeah.  Anyway, I had a problem with this couple pretty much the whole time. 
[00:03:30]  French couple.  French couple, and they didn't speak English.  Yeah, we...  So I go diving.  This was like midweek.  And, uh...  This is kind of...  This isn't a good story.  All right.  So I start my descent to the bottom of the ocean.  To the bottom of the ocean, Opie.  Well, they only take you 60 feet, but that is the bottom where we're going.  The bottom of that part of the ocean, sure.  And then you get to go over some ridges and stuff where it's a little deeper, but whatever.  So you're with the guy.  Now, I've done about nine or ten dives, like I said. 
[00:04:00]  So it was quicker for me to get to the bottom than, like, the guys that are doing their first or second dive.  But they're feeling more comfortable.  Feeling a little comfortable.  So I'm at the bottom of the ocean waiting for my fellow divers, because you've got to dive in a group.  Bottom of the ocean.  Because I'm not really certified.  Yeah.  Got your tanks on.  You're looking good.  Yeah.  All right.  And I'm just looking around.  I'd like to fish and stuff.  Go, all right, cool.  I can't wait to start the dive.  Here comes the French guy.  What is this, a group-up point or something?  You all descend to the bottom of the ocean. 
[00:04:30]  Well, I mean, if you want to get technical, you've got to descend to the 15-foot bar for a while, hang out there, and then you drop from there.  But eventually you're on the bottom of the ocean.  Yeah.  So as I said, drop from the bar, it took me whatever, ten seconds to get to the bottom of my left.  Okay.  Do a little equalizing, and you're down there ready to go.  So I'm at the bottom, 60 feet under, and here comes the French guy.  That doesn't speak English.  That has the girlfriend with the hairy armpits that I just hated from the first day I saw him at the club.  And now he's new, because you've got to go through the whole orientation. 
[00:05:00]  Without a doubt, this guy was probably making his first dive, maybe second tops.  So he starts coming down, and I look above, and I'm like, hello, I'm right here.  Where was he looking?  He wasn't looking.  That's the problem.  Okay.  So I look up, and I'm like, the son of a bitch is heading right for me.  Come right for us!  That's right.  Do I have the clip of Opie somewhere?  I think I do.  Here's Opie on the bottom of the ocean.  It's coming right for us! 
[00:05:30]  Oh, wow.  But this is how twisted my head is.  Yeah, thanks, Dick.  Yeah, exactly.  So I obviously could have probably moved and let him just land softly.  On the bottom of the ocean, yeah.  That's the way I was.  But I wanted to see where this was going to go.  So I look up, and I'm like, he's getting closer, he's getting closer.  Is he going to move?  Is he going to move?  He doesn't move.  His fin pretty much takes out the left side of my face.  Hard.  Boom!  So his fin kicks you in the side of the head. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah.  Now, does your regulator move or something?  No, no, no.  You're under there.  No, because that would have been a whole different problem.  Then we would have taken it on land.  That's what I'm going to say.  We would have.  Okay?  Usually, you'd take it down to seat level.  Okay.  We would have taken it on land.  On land.  You'll understand in a minute.  So he kicks you in the face.  Yeah, pretty much the left side of my forehead here.  Did the mask come loose?  Did anything like that?  Or right on the side of the head?  Right on the side of the head, mostly.  He came down like this, okay?  All right.  So I'm like, look at that. 
[00:06:30]  And I'm a little pissed.  Let me get this straight.  A French guy went down on Opie.  No, no.  House from Flanders, New Jersey.  Listen to the rest of the story.  Yeah.  So he hits me.  But, see, his legs were flailing as he's going down to the bottom.  So that, to me, was like, okay, he's a beginner.  I'll give him a little slack.  Right.  He's freaking a little bit.  But, boom, Finn hits me on the left side of the head.  He continues his descent.  Now he's basically, here comes the jokes, but he's basically on top of me. 
[00:07:00]  All right.  His tank now nails my hip.  Now he's coming down.  He's still coming down.  He's still coming down.  Now the heavy tank nails me in the side.  And if you don't believe me, I mean, I could show you a bruise, but everyone's going to call me a fag for pulling my pants down.  But trust me, it's there.  All right.  But if you need to see it, I'll, you know, I'll carefully show you the bruise.  Really bad.  So, hold on to your seats, kids.  You're Palo.  So, at this point, I give him the, I don't give him the benefit of the doubt, but I'm just waiting for, like, a look of, wow, you know, I'm sorry. 
[00:07:30]  I'm out of my mind.  I don't know what I'm doing.  But he's friends.  Except my apology.  Yeah, but it doesn't matter what language you speak.  You can look at a guy and you can give him something with your facial reaction.  So, you're still willing to play this off as he's a beginner.  But I'm heated.  Now you're pissed.  I'm heated.  On the bottom of the ocean.  He looks at me.  We're 60 feet under, okay?  Right.  He looks at me and he doesn't give me anything.  Nothing.  You know when someone cuts you off and does a stupid move on the road, but you can almost see through it if they kind of give it up. 
[00:08:00]  They look and go, ah, okay.  Kind of give it that look like, I know I screwed up.  I'm really sorry.  Please forgive me.  You're still a little pissed, but at least they acknowledged it.  Yes.  The guy didn't acknowledge it, and that really pissed me off.  Yeah.  So, I punched him in the head.  You punch the French guy in the head.  Now, you're on the bottom of the ocean, 60 feet under.  I start a fight with a French guy.  What is wrong with you?  What is wrong with you? 
[00:08:30]  Every year I have to punch someone in the head, because I was just thinking.  It's been a year since I popped Paul in the head in the studio.  Paul Bond.  Wouldn't that have been funny if it was actually Paul Bond diving down and Opie punched him in the head?  Now, where did you hit him?  He's right on the side of the head.  All right.  In the side of the head, you made sure you didn't hit his regulator or his mat.  I was just going for the head shot.  Well, you didn't even care.  You just happened to land on the side.  No, I didn't care.  No, because the rest of the body is pretty much protected with the vest and the tank.  And you got a wetsuit on, you know. 
[00:09:00]  So I popped him on the side of the head.  Now, you're sitting there like, oh, my God.  You know, wow, you're so brave and stuff.  Yeah.  Obviously, it was a slow motion fight because we're 60 feet under the water.  I couldn't really get a good punch flying underwater.  Even James Bond had difficulty in the movie.  I couldn't get my weight behind the punch.  Right.  It was just kind of, but it made me feel good.  And were you standing up at this point?  Sort of, yeah.  Your feet are kind of touching the sand at the bottom of the ocean. 
[00:09:30]  I was probably just above the sand.  Oh, right.  They wanted to stay off the bottom there.  Right.  And away from the coral and stuff.  Right.  Yeah, it was like a $6 million man fight in slow motion.  I punched him in the side of the head, the French guy.  He proceeds to push me.  Now you're getting into it.  You're into it.  You're throwing down.  Yeah.  You're throwing down.  I'm not 60 feet under water.  You mean underwater with a Frenchie.  Which, quite frankly, is kind of scary. 
[00:10:00]  Like I said, I'm only 10 dives into my little diving chair.  And he's fighting.  I'm fighting.  You can't fight underwater like that.  So he pushes me, but obviously the effort just isn't really there because you're not on  solid ground and you're 60 feet under the water.  Right.  So that's when I attempted to tackle him because your instincts take over.  Now, if you're on land.  Aquaman.  If you're on land, if you're on land, every fight starts with a couple of punches, maybe  a couple of pushes, and then you get down into hopefully wrestling and throwing someone 
[00:10:30]  down to the ground, right?  So, how will Aquaman handle this?  So my instincts take over.  I'm like, all right, well, I got to fight now.  No matter where you are.  I attempt to tackle on 60 feet under the water.  So now what?  Bring me through it.  How did you go to tackle?  I just kind of went forward.  You went forward, of course.  And, you know, I tried to grab him and knock him down and realizing it just wasn't going to  work.  At this point, the guide had a break. 
[00:11:00]  He's breaking up a fight 60 feet under water.  Yes.  Aquaman then whistled for a seahorse and rode off.  Now, I don't think the guide saw everything that was going on.  Oh, the rest of the people in our group, definitely were watching.  Oh, yeah.  Placing some bags.  Oh, yeah.  I'd have been like, this is the coolest thing I'll ever see under water.  I don't care if a goddamn mermaid swims by right now.  This is a brawl.  Wait, this guy's got a similar story.  A fight. 
[00:11:30]  I thought this was quite unique.  Oh, Jesus.  Uh, Tony, what's going on?  What's up, boys?  Hey.  Oh, kicking ass under water.  Had something similarly happened to me in Cancun.  Yeah.  The guy, instead of, like, hitting me with the flapper, pulled me like an elbow shiv right  to the head.  Yeah.  So, instead of, like, retaliating that way with fists, I just ripped the dude's oxygen  right off the dude almost drowned.  Now, that, I think, could be attempted murder.  I can't do it.  I ain't taking a shot to the nose.  I know I'm bleeding under water. 
[00:12:00]  I'm, like, foggy.  For two days, I was like, duh.  You know, and I think this type of thing happens more often than you think because the dive  guy, the guy that goes with you, he wants his group close together because he's got  to, you know, watch you.  Got to watch everybody.  And, you know, some of these guys, when they're doing their first or second, I'm going to  say it again.  I'm only 10 dives in, but I feel a little more comfortable under the water.  I mean, their arms and stuff are flailing.  They're freaking out because it's the first time they're underwater.  Will from Staten Island checking in.  You're breaking the rules. 
[00:12:30]  He said, the first rule of underwater fight club is you don't talk about underwater fight  club.  Underwater fight club.  Silent dirt.  It was great, though.  Underwater fight club.  So then, yeah, then the guy, you know, he broke us up and we went on our dive. 
[00:13:00]  I'm convinced he didn't see the whole thing because I think he would have brought us all  back to the top.  And then the rest of the dive, any time he got close to me, I just kind of pushed him  off.  Well, I would stay away from you at that point, thinking you were a complete lunatic.  All right.  Who fights underwater?  Now, every contact the guy made with you, Opie, was accidental.  Careless, stupid, but it wasn't intentional.  Every contact you made with him was intentionally to hurt this gentleman.  Hey, I snapped. 
[00:13:30]  No, no, no, no.  No water.  No, because there was a bunch of other things I could have done.  Turn off his air hose.  That would have freaked him out a little bit.  Did you take into consideration where you are when you decided then you were going to  tackle this guy?  And I can't believe he is tackling me.  Let me make it perfectly clear.  It looked completely ridiculous.  You're right.  Yeah.  Nothing got done.  There was no, there was no, you know, no one really getting hurt.  It's just a fact that I snapped 60 feet under the water and punched a guy. 
[00:14:00]  It's probably like hitting him with, like, marshmallows or something.  But, yeah, yeah, you can't really get a punch going.  So then the rest of the time, I would just give this guy the dirtiest looks around the  resort.  And he just acted like, you know, his ass didn't stink.  Well, he's probably right now on some French radio show going, you know, he kicked his ass.  I punched him so hard he got the bleeds.  Jay Moore, buddy, on the instant feedback, also wondering if you pulled any of the underwater 
[00:14:30]  matrix moves because you're kind of suspended there.  You could have done the cool matrix moves underwater and scared the pee out of him.  My God.  Oh, no.  It's this matrix.  No damage was done.  It was just the fact that I snapped underwater.  Neo.  It frightened me.  Neo, right.  You know, you could get up, put your arms up, and then spin her out.  In place.  Looking bad.  Hey, Dave, what's going on?  Yo, I have to ask you, because, you know, I've been on dives before.  What did you do when you got back up to the surface?  Yeah, I wish I had a good end to the story. 
[00:15:00]  Nothing, really.  It was a big boat with a lot of other divers, and we just kind of avoided each other.  Oh, you're kidding me.  No.  I mean, I got enough pleasure just trying to punch some guy in the face underwater, man.  Congratulations.  All right, Dave.  Bye-bye.  Bye.  Good job.  And you couldn't talk to the guy, because, like, I saw the story off.  The guy was French.  He didn't speak a word of English.  No.  Scuba fight.  Great.  Scuba steel.  All right. 
[00:15:30]  How to fight scuba style from Rich and Farisels.  Flood his mask.  While he's blind, release his weight belt.  Swim away and enjoy your dive.  Right.  Because the guy will go right to the surface.  Nice.  That's a really good idea.  You actually started it.  The guy accidentally hits you.  I understand he hurt your hip and stuff.  Why?  But it was his own inexperience and, you know, inconsideration to not say anything.  You threw the first punch in anger.  He never punched me.  He never punched me.  Like, yeah, he's underwater. 
[00:16:00]  His first dive, he's probably petrified.  Like a wussy push.  Like a girl.  All of a sudden, I saw this brown substance oozing from his suit.  So I hit him, because he was close to me.  He picked up some fire coral and cut him.  Yeah, there you go.  Like sea hunt.  Right.  Like an old episode of Sea Hunt.  Get the knife out of your leg and cut his hair off.  I mean, he always did.  Hope he had lifeless eyes like a doll's eyes.  Are you hearing the music, L.P.? 
[00:16:30]  Shut up!  Wow, I am getting pounded. 
[00:17:00]  And he ain't taking an at-ski.  Oh!  Oh, French-ki. 
[00:17:30]  Here comes French-ki.  And your girl is hairy.  I'll give it a left and a right.  I'll kick Bruce's ass.  Popeye used to do some of that underwater fighting.  Underwater, but he ate the spinach, and his arms would go really fast.  And he can make his feet go and his pipe like a propeller, and go like a torpedo into the guy. 
[00:18:00]  So why don't you do that?  I forgot about that.  Oh, need me spinach.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  Listen to me.  The human world is amazing.  Yeah.  Under the sea is there anything you've got to bear.  The dark way greener is somebody else's baby.  Oh.  The big big baby.  At the world of the ocean.  Ha!  The ocean floor.  The wonderful things are not. 
[00:18:30]  What more is you looking for?  Under the sea.  Under the sea.  Get on your hands and knees like a dog.  That's it.  Call her out.  I'm going to show you what's going to do.  I'm going to show you what's going to do.  While you've been voting for time, you're flooding under the sea.  Under the sea.  Opie and Anthony.  I can't tell someone.  We can't let these people in the tradition.  I'll let you know why. 
[00:19:00]  We're in the toilet.  I'll never work in this town again.  How do they let this on the air?  We talk.  Everyone hates us.  Child.  1027-WNEW.  We have that effect on people.  212-757-1027 is our phone number.  All the big stars on the show today, Anthony.  I know.  Christopher Titus.  We had the Russian mobster from The Sopranos that beat up Tony's sister with the fake leg. 
[00:19:30]  Uh-huh.  We had Big Pussy's wife's dog on the show today.  The poodle.  Yes, we did.  The poodle.  And now to follow all that, the great Lenny Clark.  Hey.  Lenny.  Hey, Opie, Anthony.  How are you?  How you been?  What's up, Lenny?  Not much, man.  I heard every commercial in America on your show.  I think it's true.  What happened to the phones?  Tell me about it.  They're whoring out this program, Lenny.  Well, I tell you, don't pay any attention to these phones. 
[00:20:00]  I'm hanging up on everybody calling here.  Yeah.  I've been waiting to talk to you guys.  I haven't talked to you since you left Boston.  We haven't talked to you in a while.  No, we saw you at Comics Come Home.  No, yeah, we chatted, but I mean, I really wanted to talk.  I miss you guys.  You were fantastic here.  You killed the mayor, and then they made you leave.  Yeah.  Have you killed anyone down there?  Have we actually killed anyone?  No.  Not killed anyone, but we've pissed this mayor off really bad.  Yeah, we got some people arrested, and we need to have some beer soon, Lenny. 
[00:20:30]  It's gotten really good.  I tell you, I'm dying to come down and see you guys.  You know, Adam does the show with you guys.  Yes.  He's my partner.  I love him.  And I can't tell you, you know, man, that New York, that place is great.  I used to go there to perform, but we'd be blacked out of our suck, and, you know,  we'd never see the place.  You just, we were like night people.  One big party for you guys.  It was, but now that we're working, that's a whole different thing.  I love it, Adam.  I hear it different, though.  I hear you're down here, even though you're working, you still like to have some fun. 
[00:21:00]  Nah, nah, nah.  I'm totally focused now, you know?  You know what Dennis said?  What?  He said, you know, you quit all the booze and stuff, and now you're falling apart.  I am falling apart.  Well, I had to go in and get my heart tapped up, you know, when I started fishing for the show.  Oh, Lenny?  Hello?  What's a hot?  A hot?  Yeah.  It's the thing that keeps the blood pumping.  Oh, a hot.  Okay.  A hot is hot.  As opposed to a hot on.  Right.  You know what that is, right?  What's the opposite of...  That's Nick Carter.  That's what he is.  Oh, no.  No, it's all right. 
[00:21:30]  I'll say whatever I feel like.  I don't care.  I like you guys.  What's the opposite of cold?  Hot.  Yeah, okay.  And then what pumps in your chest?  Blood.  You bastard.  Ah, that accent's amazing.  He doesn't want to play.  No, no.  But you know what?  Well, you know what happened?  They said, can you lose the accent for the show in New York?  And I said, well, let me see the script.  And I said, well, there won't be any car.  There won't be any apartment.  There's not going to be no party.  It's not going to be bizarre.  It certainly won't be retarded.  I think we covered it all. 
[00:22:00]  And you don't say wicked.  I don't say wicked.  I don't say pisser.  Wicked pisser.  But I say hand release.  Yeah, yeah.  That was a funny episode.  I'm telling you, man.  We're digging the job.  We really are.  Thank you, guys.  Thank you.  That's a really, really good show.  Well written.  And you guys are hilarious.  Well, I tell you, you know what?  I was glad to do your show because you guys are the most  listening to people down here in New York, aside from the fact I like it.  But tell everyone that West Wing is a repeat.  I mean, why are these people watching stuff?  The show's not going to change. 
[00:22:30]  It's the same show you saw two months ago.  Give us a break.  Why would you watch that show first run?  You know, I don't understand.  Oh, look.  My team thinks he's the president.  Oh, Rob Lowe is a good looking guy.  And they surround him with ugly people to make him look even more attractive.  I don't understand that.  And then the chicks in there, I wouldn't bang for practice.  You got that tall, geeky guy who's bigger than me.  Or that chick who thinks, oh, I think she's a man.  And then you got the two bits of blood so I can't tell apart. 
[00:23:00]  And they foam in the basement.  And, you know, between that and Survivor, I can't.  I got TV rage.  I want to kill everybody on TV.  Well, you don't have to compete with the Survivor.  Well, you had to one week, right?  One week.  Yeah.  You know, but that show, I didn't get sucked into this show.  No?  No, no.  I'm not watching.  I don't care.  To me, I'll only watch if they let loose wild animals in the island and kill everybody there.  That would be a good Survivor show to me.  Why watch anything else when you can watch Lenny Clark's ass stuck in one of those police 
[00:23:30]  school things with cops trying to pull him out?  That was classic.  Yeah, geez, you know, that's something.  I don't want to have kids to see that.  Hey, Lenny, Lenny, you know what show I'm digging these days?  Which one?  Watch this, then.  A boot camp.  Really?  Really?  Really?  Have you flipped together?  Have you flipped all together?  You've got a fetish now?  You need some people spanking you and screaming and yelling at you?  That's what it is, huh?  Get married. 
[00:24:00]  Yeah, get married.  Get married.  You're going to have a boot camp 24 hours a day.  So, what happened to the hot?  Oh, well, let me tell you.  Can we discuss that or we stop?  Yeah, no, that's fine.  I'm on.  It's their fault.  It happened.  Yeah.  First of all, you know, Dennis tells everyone, oh, you know, I wrote this show with Lenny  and mine.  He's a liar.  He wrote the show with me and lied, but then I auditioned, and then they said, well, we  got a few other people who did a good job.  I said, well, bring him down.  I'll slap him around.  And I said, well, why do I have to audition?  You're a big star.  Can't you just give me?  He said, well, Lenny, you want me to give you the show just because you're my friend? 
[00:24:30]  I said, duh.  Yeah.  I said, well, I can't do that.  I said, well, maybe not what I'm not good at friends.  So we go down, and I whack these guys out.  I mean, I really kick some ass, and I get the job.  And he said, does it make you feel better to know you've won the pot on your own?  I go, not one bit.  I said, what if I had a bad day?  You know what I mean?  There's a lot of people who are auditioning machines.  I wanted that job.  Oh, anyway, so they check my heart, the blood bumper thing there, and they say, are you all  right?  And I go, yeah, why?  And they go, your heart's all screwed up. 
[00:25:00]  I said, what do you mean?  So they did all these tests.  They said, you should be dead.  And I said, really?  They said, your heart is beating 192 beats per minute.  I go, isn't that like an athlete?  And they went, no.  Because I thought more would be better.  You know, athletes beat like 70, 60, 70.  I'm doing like a buck 90.  And they go, you could drop it any minute.  So then I had to take all these pills, and I had to go to all this medication and stuff.  Maybe you should say no to the running scenes in the job.  Well, you know what I did?  I did that one running scene, and I pulled up lame. 
[00:25:30]  What do you call it?  A hamstring?  I haven't done this in 20 years.  You know what I mean?  I haven't always been a big, fat, loaded guy.  I used to be in great shape.  But anyway, I pull up lame, and they said, well, do you want to go to the hospital?  And I go, no, I'm not no pussy.  You're going to be in a hospital.  Just let me go for the rest of the day.  I'll go home and put some heat on it or something.  They said, well, we're going to send a massage therapist over to you, my wife.  Hey, good.  So I go home, and I tell the wife.  I says, hey, I've got a massage therapist coming up here in a little while.  You may want to go shopping or something. 
[00:26:00]  So the doorbell rings, and they let the guy up, and it's that big, fat, sweaty guy, bigger  than me.  And I go, hey, how you doing?  He goes, I'm Lenny.  I go, I'm Lenny.  He goes, I'm Lenny.  I go, oh, this is not mine.  I said, I come in.  I told the wife, keep an eye on this guy, you know, because he was big, you know, and  they could have knocked me out with that secret, you know, that whole thing and done things  to me, had their way with me, you know, and then I have more problems than a bad heart.  Well, you didn't even send me a girl?  No, they thought it was a big joke, and then I had to pay the guy.  I go, what kind of company is this?  I mean, they reimbursed me, but what if I didn't have the cash? 
[00:26:30]  What if I didn't have the debts that week?  I would have been out of luck.  He'd have taken it out in trade.  Oh, jeez, that's all I need.  So, Lenny, what's happening on the job tonight?  There may be an ass shot of me tonight.  I don't know.  Oh, no.  Oh, yeah, I don't want to scare the kids either, but, you know, you never know what's going  to happen in this show.  A little plumber crack.  The language is one thing, you know, some of the content.  The drive, the booze, the smoke, but not my ass.  Your ass, Lenny.  They got to throw up a line somewhere.  I wanted to get a stunt ass, but, you know, they wouldn't listen to me.  That would be funny. 
[00:27:00]  That would be funny.  It won't be that guy who gave me the massage.  I'll tell you that right now.  Hey, Lenny.  Yeah.  Elizabeth Hurley.  Oh, man.  It was amazing.  She was on, what, the second episode?  Yes.  Yes.  It was one of the dream come true of my life, and I was fearless, because I knew she wasn't  going to have sex with me, so I could do whatever I wanted with her.  Everyone else is trying to win a deal.  Oh, God, they're all dressing up.  They're all looking good.  I come in there sweaty, stains all over me. 
[00:27:30]  Hey, how you doing?  You know, you hang around with Pavarotti?  You know, who's Pavarotti?  The fat guy sings.  He's a middle of, you know, maybe, you know, in one of your crazy fashion shows you may  come across.  You know, because I think that guy.  You're funny.  You're the only fat guy I know.  So I had a blast with her, and I think she's a chubby chick.  I think if my wife wasn't around, I could have done it.  Oh, yeah.  I really figured.  You know, I got the feeling.  You know how you get the feeling, fellas.  Hey, hey, who got a piece of that?  You know, I'm not sure.  I don't think anybody did, but I think I was the closest. 
[00:28:00]  You were the closest.  In my mind, I had it twice.  I gave her the best 35 seconds of my life.  Where are you living, down here?  Right now, I'm in Martha's Vineyard, where I live.  Oh, you live in Martha's Vineyard?  I live in Martha's Vineyard.  I got a beautiful six-and-a-half-acre spread.  I'm a mile and a mile off a dirt road, off a dirt road.  I could kill you with a high-powered rifle before you ever heard it coming.  It's unbelievable, fellas.  I really made it.  Yeah, that's if you were allowed to have a gun in that commonwealth.  Well, yeah, the People's Republic at Chilmark. 
[00:28:30]  I can't get down any trees, you know.  But unfortunately for me, there was a big tornado came through.  It sounded just like a chainsaw.  A tornado.  Well, maybe it was a typhoon because I'm close to the water.  Oh, one of those things, a spigot.  I don't know.  It was bad.  It was bad because now all you can see is water.  Wasn't that just you heading for the buffet table?  I'll tell you what, man.  I'm planning on getting real sick this summer, losing a lot of weight.  Yeah?  Well, that's one way to do it.  Oh, yeah.  Because, you know, you can work a cold into an ammonia, into a flu, and, you know, you'll 
[00:29:00]  nearly die.  And people say, you look great.  What happened?  I get sick.  Hey, Lenny.  Yep.  When you get sick of the wife, come on down and hang with us.  We're doing some sick stuff on the show these days.  You guys, I'm telling you, man, I'm so happy.  Not only are you kicking ass down there, but you're syndicated on weekends, right?  Yeah, a little bit here.  Yeah, a little bit here.  You're syndicated.  I want to tell your listeners, these guys are so whacked out.  The company that got them fired, that was behind it, hired them back for the weekend syndication.  You guys rock. 
[00:29:30]  I love it.  And I want to say, once again, that's Nick Carter.  I hope they get this on the internet there.  You are the man, man.  All right, guys.  All right, Lenny.  Listen, thanks for plugging the show.  Tell all your listeners, let me tell you this, I really appreciate it.  And you're listening to Two Wackiest Sons of Bitches in New York City, Opie and Anthony,  on whatever channel you're on.  Hey, Lenny, you've got to come by and see us next time you're in New York.  You've got it. 
[00:30:00]  I'll drag that little bastard Adam over there.  We'll have a ball.  And remember, the Sox suck.  Hey, listen.  You know what can I say?  You know, it doesn't faze me.  After 67, I gave up on them.  67?  67?  Yeah, I stuck into 43 games that year.  Yeah?  You know, you're a kid from the projects.  You don't get any money.  You're going to make your own fun.  All right.  Go Boston, man.  I love it.  Yeah.  All right, Lenny.  Thanks, fellas.  I really appreciate it.  Thank you, Lenny.  Good talking to you guys.  Later.  All right.  Good job.  There he goes.  Right after Drew Carey on ABC.  You know, I'm down over New York. 
[00:30:30]  I thought I was with the mother-in-law again.  Where's my box of wine?  I want to go home.  I want to go home.  I want to go home.  I want to go home.  All right.  We've got to take a quick break.  We'll be back.  212-757-1027.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  They sound like clones.  Opie.  I am stupefied.  Answer me.  I am stupefied, man.  They sound like clones.  Opie.  Shut up, you ass wife.  Answer me.  Shut up, you ass wife. 
[00:31:00]  They sound like clones.  Opie.  Answer me.  Opie and Anthony.  Y'all going to make me lose my mind.  Opie.  Opie.  Wait a minute.  They are clones.  Jackass.  Jackass.  W-N-E-W. 
[00:31:30]  There's an article in the paper today.  Hollywood just freaking out.  They see what's going on with Napster and, you know, everyone burning their own CDs and stuff.  They don't want the same thing to happen with DVDs.  Oh, it'll happen once the...  I guess there's, what, there's code on the DVDs or something?  Mm-hmm.  And there's supposedly programs out there or websites that you can go to and figure out  how to get rid of the coding.  Yeah, and you can download full movies off the internet.  It's kind of, it sucks now because the bandwidth problems is that it's hard to transfer that 
[00:32:00]  much information.  It's just not as easy as, you know, doing the music thing, right?  But music was almost impossible just a year ago.  The music was, yeah, maybe six months ago.  They're coming up with a new way to compress this stuff and get it across.  And before you know it, sure, real-time movies will just, you know, you'll do what you do  on that.  You hop on a site.  You pop in an actor or a movie title or a director or something.  And all these choices of movies will come up.  You punch down on it.  And there it is.  Yeah. 
[00:32:30]  You burn it to a disc.  You pop it in your DVD player.  And there you are watching a movie at home.  Who does that screw?  You, everyone, Blockbuster, Hollywood, F them all.  F them all.  I love this.  Speaking of movies, you got a nice little present today from Steve C.  Yes.  Got to thank Steve C. from foundrymusic.com.  The Jaws DVD.  I heard you guys talking about that the other day.  So I figured I'd do it.  I watched it last night.  It's rolled back.  Life is a, like a dog's eye.  I was laughing because they were doing the whole autopsy on the doc scene. 
[00:33:00]  Oh, yeah.  This is amazing because I got the speech.  Pretty close.  But Ann's got it word for damn word.  Oh, the mayor.  Yeah.  Do the mayor.  That was the mayor.  Look, fellas.  Let's be reasonable.  This is not the kind or place to perform some kind of a half-assed autopsy on a fish.  And I will not stand by while you cut that thing open and watch that little Kittner boy spill out all over the doc.  Little Kittner boy.  That's good, Anthony.  I want them strung up by their Buster Browns. 
[00:33:30]  He's the best.  The mayor's the best.  Yeah, really.  And the greatest part.  We might have to get some mayor clips from George.  Yeah, we should.  I love when the mayor finally realizes that there is a shark problem.  And Brody gets him to sign the paper.  And he's just in the hospital.  I thought it was.  I thought it was.  I thought it was.  The piece of that.  Brody.  He's all screwed up and everything.  He's just wandering around.  I can't wait to see it.  I'm going to definitely watch this tonight.  It was cool. 
[00:34:00]  It was definitely cool.  And what do they got on here besides making of?  There's like an hour long.  The making of was a lot of fun.  It was.  They show you how antiquated that old shark was.  Yeah.  Botanical.  No digital enhancement there.  It just shows you because we, all of the movies that are being released now have these elaborate digital effects.  And this thing was this huge rubber shark.  Yeah, it was a huge machine on this huge metal pulley contraption.  And it would sink every time. 
[00:34:30]  They put it in the water.  It didn't work for like the first three months of production.  You know, and I was watching Jaws last night and I was looking really close to the shark.  God, when did that come out?  75, right?  You did a damn good job.  It still holds up to the test of time, that damn shark.  Huh.  The little video game doesn't, though.  No, no.  Remember that?  The little kid playing the video game?  Yeah, no.  Shark attack or something?  A little cartoon shark?  The making of it is really interesting. 
[00:35:00]  You know the shark cage?  Yeah.  You know that was a midget in there?  Yeah, they put a midget in the shark cage.  Did you know that?  I had no idea.  Took them down to Australia.  Yeah.  And, uh, yeah, so that way the sharks that were swimming by would look bigger.  Just what they would look just absolutely new.  He was playing Hooper.  So.  Hooper!  Ain't you watching it?  Now, I want those little paint-happy bastards caught and hung up by their Buster Brown.  I love that guy.  We gotta get the mayor drops for our radio show. 
[00:35:30]  That's our latest project.  It's just swimming with bow-legged women.  Don't drink that.  All right.  Yeah, city hands.  I'm counting money all your life.  So, and you'll enjoy that Jaws DVD.  It's right up here, Alex.  Yes.  You want to talk about the Jaws exhibit at Universal Inn?  How lame is the Universal Studios tour Jaws thing?  The whole tour is pretty lame.  No, the whole tour blows.  You get on these trams if you've never done this. 
[00:36:00]  I think everyone's done it at some point in their life.  If you've ever been to California or what's even worse than the California one, at least  the California one, I think they actually used some of the sets.  I don't even believe that.  Like the car from Back to the Future?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  No, that obviously isn't the one that was used.  Oh, yeah, that's the Blues Brothers car.  Yeah, yeah, I believe that.  No, no, on the Universal lot, they did have Leave It to Beaver's house.  Right.  In California.  Now, I think, Steve, do you know anything about that? 
[00:36:30]  What?  The Universal?  I took that tour actually last October.  In California or Florida?  In California, yeah.  Okay, and I think a lot of those sets were used.  Sure.  They got like the facade from, you know, Psycho.  Yeah, yeah, they got the little motels down below and stuff.  It's not like these full-blown houses.  No, we know that.  That's the front.  Oh, and boy, the tram driver doesn't let you forget that.  These, of course, are called facades.  As we drive around the back of the house, you'll notice that, oh, look, no walls. 
[00:37:00]  I guess June Cleaver couldn't get dressed in here.  Which means false front facade.  And now the Jaws exhibit.  Look, here we are in the lovely town of Amity.  There it is.  And look, there's the fisherman out there.  You catch anything?  Oh, my God.  What's happened to him?  His boat turned over.  He didn't even move. 
[00:37:30]  His legs didn't flare or nothing.  He just turned right over and still holding his fishing pole.  And he got sucked into the water.  And he got sucked into the water.  Oh, my God.  Oh, and we're heading right for him in our tram.  Gee.  We're really scared.  Because you can see Jaws' head.  You can see the Jaws' head right under the surface of the water, not moving until that big machine behind him pushes him right towards our tram.  Those of you that are left might want to get your cameras ready for this very spontaneous opportunity. 
[00:38:00]  It wasn't even working the day we went.  No.  The tram just kind of drove by.  Drove by.  He's out of hand.  The limp Jaws just sitting there out of the water.  It's like, oh, great.  Now we're turning down New York Street, which is an exact replica of New York City.  Yeah, bull.  Not even close.  Exact replica.  We're the Nigerians.  Yeah.  Yeah, the funny thing is Rick was one of the tour guides at Universal Studios.  He used to do that. 
[00:38:30]  Do you remember any fun lines?  Yeah.  Okay, here.  I got to hear some of the real lines.  How many times a day did you have to do this?  Five times a day.  Five times a day.  Basically once an hour.  Twenty-five times a week.  All the rooms loaded on the tram.  Let's hear.  Okay, let me get in the mood.  Yeah.  All right, I'm sitting in the tram.  I'm sitting in the tram.  Universal Studios.  I've been in a hot line for like two hours waiting with screaming kids. 
[00:39:00]  And I'm finally on the tram.  And here's Rick to entertain us.  And what kind of fun?  Cast your mind.  We're in California.  Okay, we're in California.  Oh, my God.  Come on.  Come on, Rick.  You remember.  You remember.  Yeah, take that off so it's more like it was.  All right.  Welcome aboard to Universal Studios.  Hollywood Super Tramp is in invite Texaco.  No, I wasn't a tour guide. 
[00:39:30]  It was a studio guide.  Ah, okay.  I'm going to be your studio guide.  And Bob, here's your driver.  Here, let's use the horn, Bob.  I'm so excited to be here.  This is great.  I got my camera ready. 
[00:40:00]  I want to hear everything our studio guide, Rick, has to say.  So don't be talking.  I got my disposable camera ready.  And I'm on my...  I want to see the psycho house.  I'm on my honeymoon.  Five Points, Texas.  What?  What do we make?  When we come up through Five Points, Texas, you'll notice that the doors on one side of the  street appear to be larger than the doors on the other side of the street.  Why is that fine?  Oh, that's because back in the 20s and 30s when they were making a lot of Westerns,  some of the actors weren't as tall as they should have been.  I'm like, maybe that's... 
[00:40:30]  This is the...  This is the...  This is the...  This is the...  And you sit there like, oh, this is ponderous.  That'd be ponderous.  And, of course, if you ever see one fly through one of those windows, don't worry, because  they can pick it up and eat it, because those windows are made with sugar.  Do we have the bus sound over there somewhere?  Where's the bus sound, Rick?  I got to get the whole thing.  I'm almost feeling it.  Like I was there.  This is great.  That's amazing that he remembers that.  I'm starting to have flashbacks. 
[00:41:00]  I remember the whole thing.  Okay, Pookie.  Horrible.  Horrible.  All right, let's pull away now from the Western Street.  Here we go.  Ah.  In our little tram.  And as we pull away from 5.6...  Don't laugh.  We'll be coming up on a small town.  You might know it.  Amity. 
[00:41:30]  Now the music would start, right?  Yeah, then we would have a little thing with a soundtrack, so you could play different  music for different sections.  Right, right.  So you go through Amity.  And we see Bob.  Hey, Bob, how's the fishing today?  Uh-oh, there goes Bob.  That's it.  Oh, the chinks would eat this up.  They'll snap and think, oh, it's gone.  Well, as we make our way around, we'll let somebody know that Bob's having a problem. 
[00:42:00]  Oh, what was that?  I bet the shark comes up.  And starts, like, chomping at the side of the fucking water stew.  Yeah, I remember that.  But then it's real believable when Jaws backs up.  Yeah, yeah.  If you look behind you, you see Jaws backing up into his original position.  Now, what about maybe the Battlestar Galactica portion?  Did they have that?  The little tunnel?  Yeah, what else do you remember?  Oh, the tunnel.  Oh, the tunnel, yeah.  Actually, we more or less talked about it as it was the, uh... 
[00:42:30]  You might remember this tunnel from the $6 million man when he ran after Bigfoot.  And you know that wasn't the tunnel they used.  It's been on that damn tram ride.  And then the, um...  King Kong.  The King Kong ride.  King Kong part, right?  They had the earthquake, too, with the, uh...  Wasn't that with King Kong?  The whole...  King Kong was on there, too.  You come into the studio, they open up the doors, and then, uh, it closes behind you.  Now we're in New York. 
[00:43:00]  Tell us about the flood that comes down the, uh, uh, the hillside.  And then the water opens up from, uh, the Ten Commandments.  All right, that...  That...  Well, the flood is earthquake.  Right, right.  All right.  So we pull into, uh, stage 54, I think.  Yes.  Which was a, uh, two-story stage.  One of the only...  One of its kind.  There we go.  Are you stoned, Mr., uh, guide man? 
[00:43:30]  You're laughing an awful lot.  My, my young, uh, son here is saying you're stoned.  Well, don't worry, Hiroki.  This thing gets very, very interesting in a minute.  Okay.  As you see, they've been doing some filming here.  That's why you see some of the sets that have been set up.  And...  That was always a line of crap, too.  Yeah.  They want...  They would never film on the tram line, would they?  Um...  That's retarded.  Actually, no.  They did do, uh, filming for, like, the...  What was the...  Beverly Hills Count 3?  Yeah.  The real bad one?  Yeah.  When you see, like, the Battlestar Galactica... 
[00:44:00]  Yeah, because it was supposed to be on the tour.  So, of course, it was going to be filmed up.  But none of the...  None of them, actually...  I remember the first time I was on it, they go,  And look, running in the background, that's Rock Hudson.  For his show, McMillan and Wife.  Like, what?  That's not Rock Hudson.  There's Peter Falk.  Yeah.  Filming Columbo here at Universal.  So now we're in the, uh, when the earthquake stage.  Yes.  And that's when, uh, the doors close.  You think, you know, this is where we're doing some filming today. 
[00:44:30]  Uh-oh.  What was that?  Oh.  That was just a little rumble.  Those are...  Those are tremors.  We get those all the time in Jalil Borgia.  A clever ruse.  Yeah.  Yeah, because then all of a sudden it becomes, like, this big shaking thing.  A truck from the top comes down.  Yes, and bursts in a flame.  Right.  And then the water comes and it floods it all out.  And it's like, driver, get us the heck out of here.  Get us the heck, because you can't curse.  Wouldn't you just be like, oh my God!  Oh my God!  Holy hell!  No, they were telling you you can't do that, because some of the people will actually freak 
[00:45:00]  out.  Oh, you should have done that.  Ladies and gentlemen, this isn't fake!  Please get out of the tram and run towards the flaming truck that just fell, and all the  working machinery!  Run for your life!  Hiroshi!  Let's go to Jimmy.  Jimmy, what's going on?  How you doing, guys?  We're doing well.  Now, I've actually done that tram ride myself, and it was pretty damn lame, I have to say,  but there was one piece of that whole thing that made me turn white as a ghost. 
[00:45:30]  What?  Do you guys remember the bridge?  The collapsing bridge!  Let our tour guide run us through the collapsing bridge, if you would, please.  Now, as we come around to this bridge, you'll notice it's one of the oldest bridges here  on the Universal Studios back lot, built in the 1920s, and it looks a little creaky,  but we're going to try and speak across the ground now.  I remember that.  Oh, okay.  Wow!  Jesus!  As we come across, and then the trick is to keep talking like nothing's going on,  and all of a sudden, the bridge drops. 
[00:46:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah, because a couple of pieces of lumber kind of fall as you're rolling up  to it, and then you get right on it, and the bridge kind of drops a couple of feet,  it feels like.  It's probably like six inches.  And then as you come off and go, that's just part of our falling bridge.  You may have seen this on the $6 million man, or the bionic woman.  Remember when she jumped backwards, but her hair was going up while she was going down?  How did they train you for this, man?  That's what I want to know.  Dude, it was an intense four-week course. 
[00:46:30]  Really?  Four weeks?  With a book about six inches thick that you had to memorize verbatim, all for $5.50 an hour.  Well, it's all struggling actors anyway.  Right, right.  They're going to make their mark.  So they couldn't care less who they got, because everybody's just like, oh, my God,  I'm going to be working in a Hollywood studio.  Oh, a Hollywood studio.  You're on the tram, boy.  I'm getting churros for $1.50 less than the other guy.  Churros.  We pass our bungalows.  How about the bungalows?  That's bungalow 54. 
[00:47:00]  He knows it all.  This is where Lucille Ball would say.  Well, she was getting banged by Frank Carter.  You should have just lost your mind and just read the whole story.  That would be great.  That would be hilarious.  Run for your lives, people.  Let's see.  What else was there?  Oh, this was a favorite.  The pinks love this one, too.  Oh, my God.  If they could understand you.  As we come up, this is what is known as, what was it called?  It was where they did all the horror movies.  But I forget the exact name of it. 
[00:47:30]  Yes.  And it'd be like, right through those walls, that's where, you know, the hunchback of Notre Dame  came walking through.  And that's where we first saw Dracula.  And if you look up there right now, there's one right now.  Wave to him, everybody.  It's the Invisible Van.  Oh, that old guy.  Wave, wave.  And then everyone would be waving.  Yeah.  All the rooms.  That's the Invisible Van.  Oh, she got everybody with a camera going, where is he?  Where is he?  Click, click, click, click.  Did you just want to shoot someone?  Did you want to shoot yourself? 
[00:48:00]  I just want to shoot myself.  I just want to shoot myself.  And then, of course, we get to Anthony's favorite part of the Universal.  That's where Moses parted the Red Sea.  Yes.  Oh, it looked just like it did in the movie.  It's like a fountain you drive through.  It's a friggin' fountain.  It's pretty pathetic.  Many gallons of water had to be used and pumped out of this.  Did you have to do the tour during Gay Day, Rick?  I don't think they had a Gay Day when I was there.  A Universal, no?  Gay Day.  That's Disney.  Look, Rick feels at home talking into his little microphone. 
[00:48:30]  Yeah.  But the funniest part is, can you totally picture Rick doing this?  Oh, without a doubt.  Yeah.  With a big smile on his face, wearing a Universal Studios uniform.  With a name tag.  It's the only time in my life I read I would wear a name tag.  And wasn't there a break that you took, like where you got out of the tram and went into  the props, little soundstage, and walked through it and then got back on the tram?  No, no, no, they stopped that, like, two years before I got there.  By people pilfering the props?  I remember, they would just parade a bunch of people through these things and like, and 
[00:49:00]  this, you might recognize, this lion or this jaguar figure was used in Back to the Future  next to the big clock.  I'm not going to watch.  They actually charge extra for that now.  When I was there, they have, like, for $150 a person, they take you to the individual  sets where they're filming.  The personal tour.  Ah, great, great.  Anthony.  Yeah.  Yo.  Hey.  What's going on, guys?  Hey, man.  Hey, man, I thought those rides were pretty damn good, except for King Kong.  You thought the Jaws ride was good?  Yeah, with the gasoline exploding and all that. 
[00:49:30]  Are you insane?  It doesn't take a lot to entertain you, huh, Anthony?  No.  All right, man.  Thank you.  Hey, syndication when it starts, gets its own radio show.  That might happen.  He's good.  Yeah?  All right, thank you, buddy.  Later.  Bye.  Jim, uh, emailing in.  Hey, Rick.  Hey!  Hey, Rick!  You're lame!  Yeah, where's my lame clip today?  Ah, forget it.  All right.  Oh, this guy, Dave, knows the revolving tunnel Lee Majors fell into? 
[00:50:00]  Where?  On line eight.  Line eight.  Let's get eight.  Dave, you have information on the rotating tunnel?  You remember the tunnel that spun around with the license side?  Yeah.  The lady told me the girl was giving the tour, said the Lee Majors got so disoriented that  he couldn't shoot the whole scene.  He kept falling down.  And that's a true story!  That is hysterical when you drive in that thing.  It's pretty confusing.  It totally flips you over and makes you feel like you're rolling.  That was the only part of the whole tour that was actually exciting. 
[00:50:30]  Yeah, because it did kind of do something to your senses.  It kind of effed you up.  Oh, you're flipping upside down.  But the rest of it, I love when they just drive you past their junk.  And it's like, and this, you know, some of these props, you see a plane here that was  used in an episode of the Six Million Dollar Man.  Or the giant shoe.  Everything is the Six Million Dollar Man.  The giant shoe, you might recognize from the incredible shrinking woman that was filmed  here on Universal Studios. 
[00:51:00]  And right here, there's the red Ferrari's Magnus to drive.  And it's just like this piece of crap laying on the side of the road.  It looks like cardboard.  It is not.  Bunch of dust all over it.  They don't even take care of the prop.  It is not.  Yeah.  I think you're lying.  Did anyone call you a liar?  Um, no.  Did you ever get anybody rambunctious?  No?  Pretty boring.  Pretty boring, yeah.  Most of them couldn't speak their language.  That's right.  Because most of the people that couldn't speak the language were the ones who decided  to sit right in the first car with you. 
[00:51:30]  So you're trying to throw out your best stuff.  Your best stuff.  I'm riffing.  I'm riffing on the Cleaver House.  I'm doing the top shelf stuff here.  Right.  I didn't get anything from, you know, the little Asian family or the Spanish people because  they don't understand English.  You might recognize this as Delta House from the movie Animal House.  And right there is 1313 Mockingbird Lane.  Oh, I've got to get a picture.  And can you imagine, like, going home and pulling these pictures out in front of people?  And this is the house that was used. 
[00:52:00]  Meanwhile, it just looks like you're taking pictures of people's houses.  It doesn't look like anything.  See this house?  Yeah, please.  Could you put the goddamn pictures away?  It's another thing.  The advent of the video camera is just...  Do you ever see people in wherever?  Museum?  Wherever.  Right here.  Right here.  Outside videotaping and going...  They videotaped the Hard Rock Cafe.  We're right across from the Hard Rock.  People will sit on the sidewalk and they'll get footage of the Hard Rock Cafe.  And you're saying to yourself, does he go home, pop this in, and go, gather around, people, 
[00:52:30]  gather around.  Check this out.  It's the door of the Hard Rock Cafe in New York.  Okay.  It's on a little longer.  Just hold it.  See, I pan to the car trunk sticking out from above the door.  You see that?  You see?  It's a little longer, a little longer now.  Just be.  There you go.  There.  Now, here is...  A shot of my wife in the subway waiting for the train to come.  Here it is. 
[00:53:00]  Oh, my God.  You go to these places like Universal Studios and stuff, and people are, like, videotaping  them buying a hamburger at the place.  Who's going to sit and watch this crap?  Or the pile of lumber that is going to be the set for the Grinch that stole Christmas.  Okay, but it isn't yet.  It's just wood.  Is he explaining to someone what that is?  Do you know how many years' worth of wasted videotape there is that no one will ever watch  that's just sitting in people's houses? 
[00:53:30]  Crap.  Crap.  All right, man.  We've got to take a break.  I need the video camera for, like, ten minutes when I first got it.  And then, you know, like, videotape everything.  And then, you know, whatever.  It's in the closet.  Throw it.  Well, that's the end of our studio tour.  We thank you for visiting Universal Studios Hollywood.  And remember, next time you're in Hollywood, have your people call my people.  We'll do lunch.  You did not say that.  Hold on.  I've got to ask Rick something.  Yeah, go ahead.  Did they have you come up with your own little closing line, or did they give you a closing 
[00:54:00]  line?  No, we just kind of stole it from everybody else.  Because we kind of had a bunch of people we were using, so they would just, like, pick  whichever one you want to use.  So you're like a wannabe.  So you used that one.  You didn't make that up yourself?  No.  You ripped some poor guy off.  Some poor Universal Studios tour guy got ripped off.  Yeah.  That was my line.  He got bumped up the back draft, so I took his, uh, kick.  Great. 
[00:54:30]  Rick.  The Universal Studios tour guide.  All right, eh.  Keep the 14-year-old away from us.  Have a drink.  I want to bang you.  Now you're going to hear this on Z100.  Have a drink.  I want to bang you.  This is normal radio, right?  Okay.  227.  W.  102.  Topless bartenders in the studio.  Oh, yeah.  Topless Bacardi bartenders in the studio.  Yeah.  Serving the drinks today. 
[00:55:00]  Looking very, very hot.  How do you guys like the drinks?  Huh?  The drinks.  Very good.  Very good.  Very good.  Nice.  They always taste better when made by a new girl.  Yeah.  Yes.  Yes.  Well, we'll get back to you ladies in a minute, but there's a big-time director on the phone  line here.  Did you guys see the movie Blow?  I heard about it.  You heard about Blow?  Yeah.  You do the Blow?  I love Blow.  I love Blow.  I love Blow.  I love Blow.  I love Blow.  I love Blow.  I love Blow.  I love Blow.  I love Blow.  You like the Blow?  That's why he's on the phone. 
[00:55:30]  Maybe he'll put me in his next movie.  Ah, well, the casting count is right here.  You never know.  At any W.  You never know.  Mr. Demme.  Oh, sorry, guys.  Are we on?  Are we on right now?  Yeah, we've got to say hi to Ted Demme, the director of Blow.  I'm going to apologize right off the bat.  We're staring at beautiful girls, and they're serving us drinks today, Ted.  That's what I'm doing.  Oh, really?  Perfect.  Not bad.  Oh, they're topless over here. 
[00:56:00]  I'm going to bottomless.  Ladies, come on.  Help us out.  Can't let Ted.  Yeah.  All right.  What's going on, Ted?  Everything's good.  How are you guys doing today?  Great.  I finally saw Blow last night.  Oh, what did you think?  I liked it.  I really did.  It's a very good movie.  And, man, Johnny Depp.  Wow.  Yeah, he's something, isn't he?  I'm trying to think what we want to talk to you about with this movie, but these girls are  really distracting.  Exactly.  I don't blame you.  Yeah, the movie.  I mean, it's been an amazing ride for me. 
[00:56:30]  I've had the project for about six years, and I've gotten to know the real George really  well, as you might imagine.  He's in prison right now.  The last picture, I think it was after the credits, was that the real George Young?  Yep.  Oh, man.  And he's in prison.  Yeah, he's there for quite a bit.  Until the year 2014.  Yeah, 2014.  He'll get out when he's 71.  And who was saying, I think you or Johnny Depp said that he has done his time and he should  be released, right? 
[00:57:00]  Well, here's the thing.  The guy, you know, there's no doubting that he is a criminal, and there's no doubting that,  you know, he's been responsible for some pretty heavy-duty transportation of cocaine to our  country.  You know, 85% of...  Yeah, you're downplaying it, aren't you?  He was basically the...  Yeah, he was the guy.  He was the American connection.  Yeah, he was.  If it wasn't for him, no one would have done coke in the 80s, basically.  Oh, yeah, sure.  That's right.  You can tell yourself that.  But, you know, it's just like, on a broader scale, it's like, you know, I've talked a lot 
[00:57:30]  about, and I've gotten to know a lot about, you know, kind of drug penalties in our country.  And, you know, from Robert Downey Jr. to, you know, to George, to kids that are on  a corner in, you know, wherever, in any ghetto selling, you know, 12, you know, rocks  of a crack in their hand, they get 20 years automatic.  Like, it's just a jail sentencing, you know, thing in our country, just all cockeyed.  And I just think it's got to be, there's no rhyme or reason to it, you know.  And, like, these 20-year-old kids getting put away for 20 years is just a joke, you  know, it's like...  Yeah, I think if you're smoking pot or something like that and you get busted... 
[00:58:00]  Yeah, I know.  I don't see the reason to have to go to jail.  I mean, these guys shouldn't be in jail with murderers.  My point was that these guys should be in rehab, you know what I mean?  And the reason I thought that George, I kind of made the same, I thought George should  be out, because I really do think he could do better on the outside.  I mean, he's got a great story.  He really wants to do somewhat of, like, a scared, straight thing for kids.  And he's paid his price, man.  He's a pretty lonely guy.  And he's done a lot of time.  So, you know, I think he could do better on the outside than he can on the inside.  Hey, let's back up just a second.  And do you want to explain really, really quickly what the movie Blow is about so everyone 
[00:58:30]  can be involved in this?  Yeah, sure, absolutely.  It's based on a true story.  And, you know, kind of on paper, the book that I read that attracted me to the project  called Blow was about a small-town kid back in the 50s, high school American, missed the  popularity, football player, moved out to Manhattan Beach in 1968 to kind of be free of his parents,  to try to figure out life, you know, as a 21-year-old would, starts selling dope and gets involved 
[00:59:00]  in it, is good in it, gets swept up in the culture, gets busted, gets put in jail next  to a Colombian guy who's best friends with Escobar.  And when he gets out of prison, he goes and meets Pablo and becomes Pablo's right-hand  man.  And he basically becomes responsible for, like we talked about before, trafficking in  about 85% of the cocaine to our country in the late 70s.  The real story for me is this man's journey, because he's not Tony Montana.  He was a regular kid who got caught up in power and greed in a warped version of the American 
[00:59:30]  dream, particularly in the 70s, in a time of great revolution in our country, and about  the price that he's paid.  He's lost a lot, and his family's estranged.  And the real, as you guys know if you saw last night, the real story for me is this love  story between he and his daughter, who is a real tough one to digest right now.  And he's been in jail for how many years now?  He's been in there, well, he's been in there on his last run for 9 or 10 years.  Yeah, and the daughter hasn't seen him yet, right?  Yeah, she's 21 years old herself right now, and, you know, trying to just, you know, move 
[01:00:00]  on with life as a normal 21-year-old.  And she helped me, she was involved in the movie, she was a consultant on the movie,  but...  And wait, wait, because I was going to ask you this, her name's Christina Young.  Yeah.  Was she the clerk in the bank?  No, no, she was a...  That was just a coincidence?  No, no, no, what happened was, there was a scene in the film that I actually cut out,  the trial scene, but I just kept the name in the credits, so I thought she wanted to see  her name in the credits.  So she helped you with the movie, and even acted in the movie, and she still hasn't seen  her father?  She hasn't seen her dad yet. 
[01:00:30]  That's a little weird, huh?  Yeah, well, you know what, man, the last 20 minutes of the film is pretty accurate  about what she went through as a kid, and she's talked to him since I've made the movie.  I've really encouraged them to at least get on the phone.  I just don't think she's ready to sit in front of her dad and go, okay, we need to talk about  this.  Do you know what I mean?  Yeah, okay.  So she's just going through, you know, think about it, you're 21 years old, and your dad  was like a huge, you know, drug runner, and like you said before, his historical, you know,  presence on our country is really, you know, heavy, and the things that she went through 
[01:01:00]  personally, that's a lot of stuff to put on anyone, particularly a 21-year-old.  Right.  The last 20 minutes of the movie were just intense.  Yeah, I mean...  Great job at that.  Oh, thanks.  I mean, I really thought I had a great opportunity.  I mean, the movie's called Blow.  It's sexy, it's fun, there's great music in it, and I thought that because I knew at the end  of the film was, this man in prison, estranged from his daughter and his wife, but I thought  it would give me a license to really have fun with the first hour, you know what I mean?  So I just wanted to show the 70s as what it was.  It was a time in our country that was great.  I'm jealous that I wasn't around, you know, rocking that time. 
[01:01:30]  It was like, there was a revolution going on sexually and musically and drug-wise, and  it was just fun, and no one knew what was going on, because they didn't have the warning  yet, but they all found out when the 80s came around.  And Ray Liotta as the father?  Yeah, Ray Liotta, I mean...  Just kind of looking the other way, kind of knowing what his son was about the whole time,  and just, he didn't know what to really tell.  Well, you know what happened?  Like, it was based, obviously, you know, based on stories that George told me, I mean, this  is a guy who, he loved his dad so much, and he didn't, he had a tough time with his mom,  as you know, since you saw the movie, but his dad, like, never ever judged him, didn't 
[01:02:00]  give him a thumbs up for what he was doing, but was just always a real dad, really good  dad to him.  And I thought of Ray Liotta for the part, because it wasn't kind of Ray's stereotypical tough  guy role.  Right.  And I thought that he'd really rise to the occasion.  I'm just so proud of his performance.  I think Ray is just phenomenal in the film.  Yeah, because we thought Ray Liotta in that Silence of the Last Sequel with the top of  his head off at the end of a blow.  That was so, that was so silly.  That was brutal, man.  That was brutal.  It's like, yeah, that book was a lot scarier than I thought the film was. 
[01:02:30]  Yeah, well, I think we could all agree with that.  So whose idea was it to put Paul Rubens in?  It's funny.  It was me.  It just, it happened, you know, once I got Johnny Depp in the film, you know, New Line  kind of gave me the okay to cast whoever I wanted, which is great.  And I usually like, you know, working on big ensemble films and putting fun people in  fun roles.  And I was actually showing Peeley's Playhouse to my daughter, and that was four years old,  and kind of, you know, seeing if she would dig it.  And we just started laughing.  I started watching, like, man, I wonder where that guy is. 
[01:03:00]  I haven't seen him forever.  And I just tracked him down and said, hey, I got this part that I love to talk to you  about.  And we met, and we just fully connected.  And Paul's just such an amazing guy and really, really talented, obviously.  And I was just, I've lucked out having him in the movie.  You know, he was great in the movie.  I mean, great.  You just revitalized him.  I know, man.  He's so good.  He's going to be in a million movies now as a character actor.  I know.  He's got, you know, he's just got such, you know, it's, what happened to him was just  a joke.  You know, when you look at, like, what our president did over the last year, you know, how he 
[01:03:30]  got crucified.  Yeah.  So you cranked him out in a movie theater, and his career fell apart.  It's because he was doing a kid's show.  Yeah.  Oh, totally.  It was a bunch of circumstances that didn't equal to a good equation.  Yeah.  Hey, another cameo.  Was that Bobcat?  It certainly was.  I can't feel my face.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Near the end of the movie?  That line was totally improv.  It's funny.  My casting director, Amy Kaufman, who's cast a lot of my films, she, you know, I said, look,  I got this one great scene, let's put so much fun in it, and Bobcat walked in the door 
[01:04:00]  one day, and I just started laughing, hadn't seen him in a while, and he sat down, and he's,  yeah, you know, I'm good, you know, started talking, and I just said, look, man, you didn't  even have to read, you got it if you wanted, I love it.  Yeah.  And we did that scene, and he comes up with that great line, because it's the biggest  laugh in the movie, and he's, you know, he's really cool, because he, I saw him afterwards,  and he's like, I really don't know why, I don't know why he put me in this movie.  Don't talk your way out of it, pal, you got the job.  You know, I have to ask you, though, is he sick? 
[01:04:30]  Bobcat?  Yeah.  No, he's actually in great shape.  I mean, I know he went on that, the weight loss thing, but now it looks like he took it  a little too far.  No, he actually looks great, believe it or not.  He's got, we put that wig on him, and we pasted him up, but wanted him to look a little  kind of, you know, white, if you will, for that scene, like a guy who spends a little  too much time inside.  So, no, he looks great, actually.  And Penelope Cruz.  Yeah, she's pretty good, isn't she?  Please tell me you got naked pictures of her that you're going to send us.  Well, she's naked here with me right now.  You want to follow her?  Nice.  Man.  She's, you know, it's funny, because I got her about, you know, I cast about, probably about 
[01:05:00]  a year and a half ago.  It was kind of before, you know, Penelope Mania hit, if you will.  And, you know, I just kind of watched her as we were shooting, you know, get the Ralph  Lauren ads, and get this, and get that, and she just held herself together so well, and  she's just a, she's just one of those, like, she's just a cool chick, you know what I mean?  She's like, and the fact that she's got an accent just takes her right over the fence.  Okay.  There's a couple people a little past, uh, Kevin's saying Ted is downplaying the problems  drugs have caused in America.  Who's saying this? 
[01:05:30]  A guy named Kevin.  Okay.  And Andy's saying Demi should see how bad Coke really is.  I think you showed that in the movie.  Okay.  But maybe they should see the film and, yeah, just for themselves.  I mean, there's a lot of people who knocked the film haven't seen it, and they think we're  glorifying, you know, drug use, whose name of the movie is below, but, you know, if you  watch the last 20 minutes, I think it's the biggest anti-drug, you know, commercial there  is.  Yeah.  I'm going to turn off the last 20 minutes and just go out and have a fun time with  Coke.  Exactly.  Just watch the first half, get an eight ball, and you'll be fine.  You watch the movie backwards, and drugs seem cool. 
[01:06:00]  Exactly.  That's right.  Just like that movie, Memento.  I read kind of like that film, Memento.  I'll start with DM and go back for a while.  Yeah.  It makes you lose a lot of weight, and it makes you young, and you get out of prison.  And you wear a really bad mullet.  It'll be great.  Yeah.  Was that Johnny Depp's real hair?  You make him grow it out like that?  A little bit of both.  We mixed some of the scenes.  Obviously, where he has short hair, it's a wig, and sometimes when it gets longer, we 
[01:06:30]  mixed his real hair with a wig, and of course, the mullet's not his real hair.  That would be courtesy of a wig factory.  Right.  And Joey on line 7, Ted has inspired my friend to be a drug dealer.  Nice.  I'm just here to help, guys.  Ted, you started with MTV, right?  Yeah, I worked as AFPA back in 1986, if you can believe it or not, MTV.  And in 88, I created Yo! MTV Raps, and met Dennis Leary, did some commercials with Dennis  on MTV.  So yeah, it was a great training ground for me. 
[01:07:00]  You were responsible for Yo! MTV Raps?  If you can believe that or not, yeah.  Oh, God damn.  I know.  I used to hate it, because it was on all the time.  I know.  And I was at the point where I wanted to just see rock on MTV like it was.  And then all of a sudden, I turn it on, and there's what?  Fab Five Freddy or something, or whatever that happened.  Come on, you wanted to be Fab Five Freddy.  Come on.  Who didn't?  Who didn't?  Turn on MTV now, and you could be like the Backstreet Boys.  Yeah, yeah.  Hey, what do you think of the music scene and MTV and all that?  I mean, you were there from the beginning.  Well, not the beginning. 
[01:07:30]  Yeah, almost.  I mean, I was there like right after the first five years when it kind of kicked in.  I mean, it's funny, because I have this conversation with friends a lot.  It's like kind of what came first, the conversation, which I'm sure you guys have all the time.  It's like, was bad music happening first, and everyone started buying it?  Or, like, if they took their bad music away, would people start buying good music?  Like, there's a lot of great music that is out there right now, but no one buys it because  there's not five little faggy boys doing a line dance, you know?  Oh, God.  And it's like, you know, enough of these, you know, it's just the same crap recycled over 
[01:08:00]  and over again.  It's frustrating, but it's a lot of good music out there, but it's just not breaking through  because, again, it's not what people want.  People want to buy.  So it's really, you know, I think the music scene, there's some really good music going  on, but it's just not being marketed.  Well, you've got to blame MTV and VH1 and radio in general for not taking the chances anymore,  either.  It's all marketed and packaged, you know?  It's all prefab.  You're right.  I mean, it's... 
[01:08:30]  I mean, music used to mean something.  Now it's just big business.  I know.  It's, you know, it's just like movies.  You can make the same argument for movies.  I mean, there's a lot of really, really great movies coming out, but there's a lot of really,  really bad movies that are out.  And, unfortunately, a lot of these bad movies make a lot of the money because they go for  the lowest common denominator.  And, like, there's great movies, like, I was just joking, like that movie Memento is just  like a masterpiece, and, like, no one's going to see it because, you know, it doesn't have  12 fart jokes per second in it.  Hey, for every bad movie out there, at least we've got one Joe Dirt. 
[01:09:00]  Yeah, I have a feeling you're making fun of Joe Dirt there, Ted.  Yeah, Joe Dirt's going to win a lot of awards, I think.  David Spade used to be a friend of mine until this week.  He went on a TV show and said, yeah, I saw Blow.  It should be called Slow.  Uh-oh.  I was like, thanks, Dave.  And he's in Joe Dirt.  Yeah, exactly.  I'll go see Joe Dirt, and I'll come back on your guy's show, and we'll talk about it.  Hey, Ted, okay, I have a question for you.  Sure.  A movie like Joe Dirt, and a lot of these movies come out, especially comedies, and it's  so obvious to everyone that the movie just sucks. 
[01:09:30]  Right.  The movie blows, no pun intended.  Right.  But the bigwigs in Hollywood, they have to see the film before they throw it at us, the  consumers or whatever, the movie viewers.  Right.  And what do they do at that point?  Just go, what the hell, they'll go see it anyway?  Or do they try to clean it up, make it funny?  I mean, what goes on?  No, I think they know going into it.  I mean, you know, unfortunately with Hollywood, and, you know, probably on the same extent  where you guys are talking about with music, I mean, there's a certain formula that works.  You know what I mean?  You make a certain film like a Joe Dirt, they make it for a certain price. 
[01:10:00]  They put a certain type of star in it, like David, that has a certain type of audience  that goes to these type of movies, which is mostly, you know, teenage boys that are  probably smoking two bongs in their car, and they're going to go in, they don't care  what they're going to see.  But these kids go and watch these movies over and over again, and it doesn't make it,  you know, it's just a formula.  So a lot of these movies that you're talking about are just caught in this formula of,  you put a guy like this in it, you make it for this type of money, it'll open for this  weekend, we'll put it on DVD, and we'll make a fortune. 
[01:10:30]  I know, it's a drag, and it's like, it's what we're talking about with music, too.  It's like, get these guys, put them in these tights, have them sing these songs, do these  little, you know, have a chorus like this, and it'll sell this amount of money.  So it used to be that if it didn't do anything at the box office, that was it.  You were effed.  Now, like Deuce Bigelow, bombing at the box office, but for some reason, then people rented  that thing like crazy.  I know, and you know what, man, you'd be surprised, because I thought it bombed the box office,  too.  It didn't.  It did money, man.  Those movies make money.  People go and see those flicks.  That's a new thing that people say with movies, too. 
[01:11:00]  You know, did you see such and such movie, and they'll go, oh, it's a good rental.  Yeah, exactly.  It sucks in the theater, but when you rent it, it's a good rental.  That's because you can watch it at home, and you can pause it, and go through what you  got to do, and come back to it, I guess.  So basically, you're saying the creative process is taking, like, a back seat.  Totally.  I mean, it's like, there's, again, there's so many great, you know, and we're jokingly  kidding about Joe Dirks, David, as a friend, but it's like, there is, it's frustrating for  me, even, because...  We should say, the movie's not good.  I'm sorry.  Well, I haven't seen it, so I can't comment, but, you know, the point is, like, for me, 
[01:11:30]  for example, like, to make a movie called Blow, where, first of all, just with that  title, just about what the content is, and then just to present a guy who is the character,  who George Young is, as a real person, not as a Tony Montana guy.  Well, people, like, are flipping out of that, like, the reactions that, you know, even just  what we're getting just today, it's like, people aren't ready for that stuff.  Why?  Because it's different, you know what I mean?  And it's like, it's a drag, like, we'll go back to Memento again, the film where, you 
[01:12:00]  know, it's so original, like, they tell the whole movie, I don't know if you guys have  seen it.  Can you explain that real fast?  Yeah, they start at the end of the movie, and they rewind to the beginning, and it's  unbelievably cool, and so well-acted, and so original, but, you know, people hear, oh,  I'm not going to see that.  I can't see it.  How's that going to happen?  You know, and, you know, so it's frustrating, but there's a lot of people that, fortunately,  a lot of people that are going to start greenlining films are guys that have been working through,  like, guys my age, 37, 38, that are hopefully going to try to get some new movies out there, 
[01:12:30]  and there's a lot of fantastic filmmakers working right now, so.  Right on.  Well, this has been a lot of fun.  Ted, one other thing about Blow?  Sure.  Bravo on the movie soundtrack.  Oh, great.  Did you guys, I'm hoping you guys dig that, yeah.  It's, you know, I wanted to make, I've always wanted to put Marshall Tucker band,  Leonard Skinner, because I'm from Long Island.  Yeah, there you go.  I'm from Long Island, and my very first concert, you know, I got on the LIRR,  went to Madison Square Garden, saw, you know, Charlie Daniels band, Marshall Tucker, 
[01:13:00]  and the Outlaws.  Oh, yeah, I was there.  And then I saw Skinner, and those guys just changed my life, and I always wanted to put them,  you know, in a film, and so we had a lot of fun with the soundtrack, Man for Man,  Earth Band, you know, Blinded by the Light, something like that.  Black Betty, Black Betty, Black Betty.  That's right, and starting off with the Stones, I mean, you know, we had to beg, borrow,  and, you know, plead to get that song from Mr. Jagger and Company, but he graciously gave  it to us, so.  Hey, Ted, you ever go to any of the shows at the old Long Island Arena in Comac?  Oh, my God, they used to roller skate there. 
[01:13:30]  Isn't that funny?  Dude, they used to have disco roller skates in the 70s there, man.  That was the bomb.  The roller rink.  Peter Frampton.  Frampton played there.  Oh, 10 years after 5-hat James game.  And it always looked like the roof was going to fall in on you.  I know, and it had that really bad lighting that I remember really vividly, and, like,  yeah, that was great.  You were skating on the general admission floor because it was covered in vomit.  Yeah.  It was great.  Exactly, because inevitably someone would puke going around on the roller skates, and no 
[01:14:00]  one would clean it up.  That was me.  Oh, very good.  Thank you.  Hey, what part of Long Island are you from?  I grew up in Rockville Center.  Rockville Center.  There you go.  Yeah, I'm a South Shore boy.  I still got my four best friends still live there, and my mom still lives there, so.  It's the law if you're from Long Island.  You need your four best friends.  Yeah, don't you?  Exactly.  You have to be on Long Island.  Your four best friends that you went to school with, that you've known since you were 12, that,  you know, da-da-da-da-da.  I got two of them here right now.  There you go.  You know what I'm talking about.  That's what I mean.  I made a film a few years ago called Beautiful Girls, and that's basically where that came 
[01:14:30]  from.  You know, it's a bunch of guys who have been lifelong friends, so.  Yeah.  Cool.  All right, Ted.  Guys, thanks a lot, man.  You guys are great.  It was really great talking.  And girls, put your time on, for God's sake.  Hey, shut up.  Hey.  It's going to ruin it.  Put your time on and come see me.  Yeah.  We're going to do blow off their cans in a minute.  Yeah.  In honor of the movie Blow.  All right, guys.  Thanks, Ted.  Thank you.  Have a great day, everybody.  Thanks.  Ted Demme.  Hey, that's a cool guy.  That was really good.  I see Long Island people, they kind of do keep very well-rooted. 
[01:15:00]  You know what I mean?  You get those Hollywood-type directors.  That's just another schmo from Long Island.  That made good.  Roller skating in the 70s.  How about that?  Huh?  Yeah, we're from Long Island.  Huntington.  Huntington area.  Representing.  Babylon.  Huntington area.  Babylon.  Nice.  Trey.  South Shore chick.  Nice.  Yeah.  Right now, $2.31.  Yeah, the only $2.31. 
[01:15:30]  Gotta go down to Bayshore.  All right.  We'll get back to the naked bartender.  Bacardi bartender's next, right?  Yeah.  All right.  212-757-1027.  Opie and Anthony.  What other radio show's going to give you, like, intelligent talk about stocks and girls  playing what's in my pants?  Yeah.  The Opie and Anthony show.  1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W.  212-757-1027, isn't it? 
[01:16:00]  In the meantime, we also got to check in with Black Earl.  Earl.  Earl, what's up?  What's happening, guys?  We're in the WOW van and then at WOW Stickers.  All right.  So, you giving out the WOW Stickers?  Getting ready for WOW tomorrow?  Yes, sir.  Earl, you all right?  Earl, liven it up, man.  Stop the weed smoking.  You all right, Earl?  Yeah, you have a cold, guys.  Sorry.  You got the cold?  I have a cold.  I have a cold?  Guys, I'm here watching this.  I'm running.  Okay?  I'm having a lot of stickers.  We got the WOW van here. 
[01:16:30]  It's going to be fantastic.  I think it's a stand-up fan because of something's been going down.  Earl.  Yes?  You sound like you're a beaten man.  I'm not a beaten man.  It's cold.  It's me picking my butt for a week.  Are you insulted because we're starting to call you Coco Earl?  No, not at all.  I want Earl to change his name to Coco Beware.  Walk around with a little parrot on his shoulder.  We're having big fun down here today. 
[01:17:00]  You're going to wear this.  Earl.  And coughing.  I'll cough on your sticker and give you my virus.  You all right, Earl?  I'm fine.  I just have a slight cold.  That's all.  Slight cold.  Hey, Earl, I'm glad you called.  What do you think of Reverend Earl going to Africa?  I think it's a cold day.  Yeah?  Have you heard this story?  No.  Jim, did you hear about Reverend Earl?  No.  He's very big here in New York, of course.  And Reverend Earl Sharpton is going to Africa, to the Sudan, on a mission of mercy. 
[01:17:30]  There's a slave trade going on over there.  People are actually enslaved.  They are bought and sold.  It's black-on-black slavery.  And Reverend Earl, very upset about this, is doing something about it.  He's going there.  He is buying slaves.  And then setting them free.  Where's he setting them free, though?  In my house.  Yeah.  You're free to clean my windows, wax my drawers in a vacuum, and cook me dinner. 
[01:18:00]  And don't make me any of that zebra burger.  You've got nice beef that I can make for you.  Earl, is that true?  Yes.  It's very true.  Yes.  Where's he going to set them free, though?  I'm not really sure, but I do know that the State Department told him not to go.  Yeah.  A lot of people against this.  And, you know, the thing is, you set something free, it's just going to get roped in again.  He could buy these slaves, but if they don't take them out of the area, they're just going to get taken up into slavery again. 
[01:18:30]  Let's be realistic here.  When you watch something like Roots and watch a slavery movie, it ain't like that.  The people that are enslaved are not sitting there in the little house with, you know, Kunta Kinte and stuff and dreaming of freedom or whatever.  Maybe they're dreaming of freedom, but they are like frigging morons.  What are you going to do?  You're going to free the slaves?  Now start your job at IBM. 
[01:19:00]  These people have only known slavery.  And get the prices, Opie.  They're pretty reasonable.  The rate for a healthy woman or child is about 50 bucks.  50 bucks.  I could swing it, give me a dozen.  River and a half.  And how is he buying slaves with Stephen Bagonis' money?  The guy has not paid Stephen Bagonis for that whole Tawana Brawley incident.  He's using the money to get some slaves.  I'm buying me some slaves. 
[01:19:30]  And you can order your own slave from rivernow.com, my website.  You get a free hubcap medallion to put around his neck like the Thrall episode of Star Trek.  So they know not to get away.  And it has a shocker thing.  But you press the button, it shocks your slaves.  Much like the Thrall episode of Star Trek.  I want to be called River Nasa.  Now, that's my name, River Nasa. 
[01:20:00]  River Nasa is going into the Sudanese desert.  He's going to be accompanied by some international and Swiss-based organizations that have done this in the past.  And they buy the slaves and free them.  And he's going to buy up a bunch of slaves.  And a lot of people are saying this is very, very dangerous.  Because the area, there's some kind of Muslim war going on there, Christian-Muslim war.  And the Muslims enslave the Christians. 
[01:20:30]  And Reverend Al, 50 bucks.  Wouldn't you buy a child for 50 bucks as opposed to a woman?  Get a few more years.  Yeah, you get some more years.  Out of your investment.  All right, one woman.  And then you buy two children.  And then you rotate.  Once the woman gets a little older.  Come here, let me check your teeth.  Oh, God.  You...  Let me check your teeth.  Let me check them foul muscles.  You look like a big old buck.  Yo, where's the 50 bucks?  And with every slave, the Reverend Al also includes Slave Jack. 
[01:21:00]  So your Negroes can't run away.  Because you can track them down with Slave Jack.  Reverend Al.  You know what?  I have a dream.  I have a dream today.  I hope this happens to Reverend Al.  He goes over there.  He's got his 50, 100 bucks in his hands.  He's going to buy a woman and a kid.  Whatever.  The people that are bringing him there, the envoy, start going... 
[01:21:30]  Oh, the other people go...  They put a rope around Reverend Al and make him a slave.  Would that be the irony of all time?  Like the guys he's going with, sell him out.  They sell him into slavery.  Because you know something?  He's not in New York.  He's in a country that is really ripped apart. 
[01:22:00]  And there's no ethics or nowhere he can go if that happens.  No protection.  They just take him.  Yeah.  And, you know, he turns around and looks at the people that brought him.  They just go...  And he's gone.  Fast forward two years and he looks like Starving Marvin.  Hey, it's Starving Marvin.  Hey, you look like Reverend Al Sharpton.  Well, you're a little skinnier, but you've got the big hub cap.  Let me tell you, Reverend Al Sharpton, now here's a bargain. 
[01:22:30]  Here's a bargain.  And we throw in a McGuire rookie card.  Look at the size of this bastard.  I know he doesn't look very physically fit to do the work around the house, but for God's sake, you ain't got to feed him for a year.  He'll be in shape to do the lawn, the windows, whatever you want him to do.  He's a big black butt. 
[01:23:00]  Have him chop wood for a week.  I don't care.  Worth the price.  And only 25 bucks.  25 bucks you pay twice as much for a little kid or a woman.  Reverend Al Sharpton sold into slavery.  My God.  And let me tell you, Don, he's got to be a...  Shut the hell up.  I know what he is.  He's huge.  Oh, boy. 
[01:23:30]  Very good.  Well, maybe Reverend Al will be okay.  I'm bringing my slaves back on the Almastad.  My ship, the Almastad.  It's a pleasure craft.  Now I'll set you free, but you've got to roll.  Why is Jim Cook all of a sudden silent over there?  But it's Reverend Al.  It's all done intact.  Right.  Like Mr. Almastad.  I feel like we've got Darva back.  Keep rowing.  Keep rowing. 
[01:24:00]  I'm the king of the world.  Yeah, I know it's hard with me on the front of this thing, but I'm the king of the world.  I'm a survivor.  Jack, hold on, Jack.  I love you forever.  I'm floating here on my big Volkswagen hubcap medallion, and there ain't no room for nobody.  Not even me.  Believe me, I'm sorry. 
[01:24:30]  You're going to freeze your ass off.  River Nile and my slaves I just purchased, we have hit an iceberg in the icy North Atlantic  on the Almastad, and the boat is going down.  I got to save my fat ass.  Why the hell you row into an iceberg?  We're doing two miles an hour.  I said, stop, God damn it.  So now I cast myself off in my big Volkswagen hubcap medallion, and believe me, there ain't 
[01:25:00]  barely room for my pinky.  Whoa, I got a fat pinky.  Sorry, Jack, but I must go on.  You slithered below the ocean, but not too far.  I might have to eat you.  Just stay there like some kind of frozen popsicle for a while.  I'm hungry.  I'm sorry, I really had good intentions here. 
[01:25:30]  I did not think we'd hit an iceberg, especially right off the coast of Africa.  I have burnt your slave sickle, which I will be selling on my website, revenue.com.  Hey, I got to make a buck.  I don't care how this ended.  Jim Cook is horrified.  Hey, can I have another beer?  I am, I am a survivor. 
[01:26:00]  Look at this skinny bitch singing this song.  He ain't like a cracker to me.  A camel's doing look like my ass.  Damn, that big.  Very nice.  Oh, yeah, break.  Yeah, we're so late.  The Reverend Alson as we go to break.  And more with Jim Cook from Sam Adams next, okay?  Who comes running when the cops get out of hand? 
[01:26:30]  Who sits the mayor's in the Ku Klux Klan?  Yelling and screaming as he's speaking to a mob.  He wears expensive suits, but he doesn't have a job.  Reverend Al, Reverend Al.  He's your pal.  Reverend Al.  Well, he's staffing all the people in his own community.  Why is the white man always picking on me?  He's got a fat belly and his head full of grief. 
[01:27:00]  He'll hear his battle cry.  No justice, no peace.  The man with a plan who you know you can trust.  The party's in a reverend with an aftershock of bug.  Reverend Al, Reverend Al, he's your pal.  Reverend Al, he looks like James Brown with too many calories.  Now why is the white man always picking on me?  Whenever Bernie gets in the brawly case, 
[01:27:30]  turn on the TV, you would always see his face.  He's feeding in his limo to another homicide.  To make the network news with the family by his side.  Reverend Al, Reverend Al, he's your pal.  Reverend Al, on a never-ending search of some publicity.  Why is the white man always picking on me?  Reverend Al, I'm Reverend Al. 
[01:28:00]  He's Reverend Al, I'm Reverend Al.  He's coming dry, I'm hungry.  He's Reverend Al, Reverend Al.  He will represent your family and he does it on the street.  Now as long as the footage makes it on the TV.  Reverend Al, I'm Reverend Al.  He's Reverend Al, I'm your pal.  He's your pal.  That's right, Reverend Al.  He's Reverend Al, Reverend Al.  He's the raised-faced white, made the bag of baloney.  Now why is the white man always picking on me? 
[01:28:30]  Reverend Al, I'm Reverend Al.  He's Reverend Al, Reverend Al.  He's your pal.  I'm your pal.  Wrapping Al.  Wrapping Al.  O.B. and Anthony.  I'm your pal.  This is debauchery mania.  I'm your pal.  Prostate exams for everyone.  I'm your pal.  1-1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W. 
[01:29:00]  It's the O&A Show.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7 is our phone number.  Well, Anthony, we've got to get into Mike Tyson.  Well, you could get into Mike Tyson.  I'll get into you without any lube.  This guy is downright scary.  He's a madman.  He is an insane madman.  And they know it.  Like, they keep him all doped up until he's got a fight. 
[01:29:30]  Well, what is he taking?  He's taking, like, Zoloft or something.  That melds you out pretty good.  And, you know, a couple weeks leading up to the fight or a week leading up to the fight,  they take him off this stuff.  So he's a lunatic in the ring.  Yeah.  So he'll kill you.  So he's fighting Andrew Gulotta, who's just a big scumbag.  And deserves whatever tights he can throw at him.  Gulotta?  One of the dirtiest fighters in the history of boxing, Rick.  Oh, yeah, up against such an upstanding guy as Tyson.  No, I understand that.  That's why this is going to be a pretty good fight. 
[01:30:00]  Yeah.  Gulotta likes to hit guys in the ballies.  That's his whole move.  He's wrecked his whole career by hitting guys in the ballies when he's winning fights.  So he's just as psychotic as Tyson.  Yeah, he's kind of insane.  He's like a blockhead.  But no one beats the Tyson.  Anyway, we got some Tyson audio.  Yeah.  And I don't know what he's trying to say.  Maybe someone could figure it out.  He doesn't have his mental faculties anymore. 
[01:30:30]  I don't know if he ever did.  Like, he's just, he's crazy.  Listen to some of this stuff.  How is this going to end, you think, with Tyson?  I don't know.  I feel he'll have to be destroyed.  That's what I'm thinking.  Maybe he'll break a leg.  Yeah.  Destroyed?  They break a leg and put him out to stud or something.  I don't know.  But I'm thinking he'll have to be destroyed.  Do you think we could revert back to a movie to explain your point a little better?  When you talk about being destroyed?  Let me think. 
[01:31:00]  I could revert to King Kong, where he was on the, he was on the, well, I just saw it the other day, the original.  All right.  You're referring to him.  When he got to New York, there was unfamiliar surroundings for Kong, you know?  And it kind of freaked him out.  And, you know, women freak Kong out.  And he wound up climbing up the Empire State Building.  And they had to send the planes in and destroy him. 
[01:31:30]  And that's what I'm saying is going to have to happen to Mike Tyson.  So if I follow you here, you think eventually that Tyson's going to climb the Empire State Building, there's going to be helicopters around in planes, and that's going to be his demise.  No, it's more figuratively, I'm saying it, not literally.  It could be the World Trade Center.  There could be a white woman involved?  There could be.  Yes, yes.  Go into such a great bit.  What I'm saying is, you know, somebody as angry as Mike Tyson, I could equate his situation to any movie. 
[01:32:00]  I could revert to a lot of movies.  Yes.  One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, but King Kong just popped in my head.  What I'm saying is just an angry guy like that.  And, sorry, a lot of guys reverting to other movies.  You might not have hit the movie on the head with that.  All right.  Let's try to see what people are reverting to.  Rich is reverting to a movie.  Rich?  Hey, guys, I have the perfect movie.  Old Yeller.  Old Yeller.  At the end, he gets rabies, he goes nuts, and they've got to shoot him.  There you go. 
[01:32:30]  Mike Tyson is like Old Yeller with rabies.  Because he started kind of, like, normal in a way.  Yeah, everybody liked him in the beginning.  As far as fighters go.  Oh, Mike Tyson.  Yeah.  Because he's yelling.  And then at the end, they've just got to shoot him because he's nuts.  And thanks, Rich, you bastard.  I never saw that movie.  I was going to rent it tomorrow.  You just ruined the ending of Old Yeller for me, you son of a bitch.  Thank you, Rich.  All right.  See you later.  That's pretty funny, though.  I heard Bruce Willis was dead during the entire movie Old Yeller.  Ah, Chris, what's up?  Yeah, George.  Why is this?  He's going around biting people, and you just shoot them at the end. 
[01:33:00]  Oh, okay.  He's biting people.  Oh, okay.  I can't.  You didn't pick our Anthony.  You didn't pick up on that one right away?  I didn't know which part of Jaws you were referring to, but that makes perfect sense.  He bites people, so he ought to stick some compressed air in his mouth and shoot it  with a rifle.  That would be it.  Yeah, it would be compressed air.  That's all.  All right, Chris, you're next on N.E.W.  I think Star Wars.  Star Wars.  You're saying you'll pile down on time and watch his head explode?  The man's in a giant death star.  Remember the last audio they talked about?  You said, eat a Vander Holyfield's children? 
[01:33:30]  Yeah.  Eat a Vander Holyfield's children.  He goes, I'm going to eat your children.  The man's crazy.  I don't know.  I'm thinking more things like Old Yeller, King Kong, Mighty Joe Young, like that, in that  vein.  Look at me.  I've been embarrassed.  Humiliation, degradation, and any other T.I.O.N. you can name that's negative, right?  But listen, and you're going to ask me why I'm like this, and all of a sudden I look  back and retrospective and say, oh, man, I've been devastated. 
[01:34:00]  And the only thing you can say that I'm paid, I'm rich, and my life and soul's been tore  apart, I love you too.  What the hell did he just say?  I think Muhammad Ali makes more sense.  Holy boy.  He can't fall gone. 
[01:34:30]  He can't fall gone.  Someone reverting to the movie The Fly with the Brundle Fly ripping the guy's arm off when  I'm wrestling.  Yeah.  See, that's a perfect example.  Let's go back to the audio, all right, Anthony?  Well, it's pervasive that I'm typically an animal, so I really think, you know, it's been  so pervasive they really believe that.  So I guess they only enjoy me being an animal in the ring, because I'm sure there are nine  million people that watch me probably hate my guts.  And most of them are probably white.  But listen, right?  But it's cool, though, right?  Because I don't know.  I probably hate them too. 
[01:35:00]  Okay, terrific.  Here's one where Tyson loses his train of thought.  I feel uncomfortable with the fact that he's not here.  I can't say it in his face.  But yeah, he's going to feel some pain.  I know probably he's mad.  I ain't going to wait.  I mean, I wouldn't have waited again.  But oh, God.  It's beautiful.  It's a good day today.  You know?  But listen, right?  Go ahead, man.  Go ahead.  What?  Wow.  What was that?  All right.  Okay.  Terrific.  What else is there to say on that one? 
[01:35:30]  He's just a nut.  That is another, like, life form that is just able to speak English.  Like, that's another type of mammal on this planet that just happens to speak some, what?  A little bit of English.  Just a piece of English.  Like, if you walked up to a dog and said hello and it went hello, it's like the same thing.  The guy is crazy. 
[01:36:00]  Tyson talking about Zoloft, the drug that he's on until he has to fight.  They take him off it so he can be a lunatic in the ring.  I'm on the Zoloft thing, right?  But I'm on that to keep me from killing y'all.  Oh, my God.  Zoloft is the cage.  Is the virtual cage that this guy is in.  He takes it to keep from killing y'all.  Y'all.  He just threatened the world. 
[01:36:30]  Right.  Like, he's taking that and pretty much threatened the world by killing y'all.  He just challenged the world.  He's like Godzilla.  He could just come out of Tokyo Bay and just destroy cities off of this Zoloft.  Thank God for Zoloft.  Who invented that?  Give him a medal.  He saved the world.  He saved humanity.  Imagine that.  A true American hero. 
[01:37:00]  Absolutely.  I don't think enough credit has been given to the Zoloft creator.  He saved humanity from the likes of Mike Tyson trying to kill y'all.  I cannot classify him as a human being.  He's going to kill somebody.  He is.  It's just a matter of time.  I've got him taking off the Zoloft.  Yeah, I got to hear that one again.  Yeah.  To keep from killing y'all.  I'm on the Zoloft thing, right?  But I'm on that to keep me from killing y'all. 
[01:37:30]  Here's Mike off the Zoloft.  There he is, turning over Jeeps.  Biting through the floor of Jeeps to try to get small children.  Come on out of there.  I'm off the Zoloft.  Come here.  Look at the kids in the Jeep, aren't they?  Cute little white children.  I'm going to bite this tire.  Don't shine that light in my pupils. 
[01:38:00]  And I think we have audio of Mike Tyson singing.  Tyson singing.  Yeah, Mike.  Woo!  I'm on the Zoloft thing, right? 
[01:38:30]  But I'm on that to keep me from killing y'all.  Come on, what's the bummer?  I said, who did you?  Not one, one.  What?  All of us is the roof.  Ain't that someone?  I'm on the Zoloft thing.  When you tell me, come back to me.  I got to get what I'm done.  And I know who the bitch you think you're going to do.  But I'm not him.  I ain't saying no box.  What you do?  But you will find yourself.  Very next to someone else. 
[01:39:00]  So we all thought you were going to sell.  But that's what they've been an issue.  And they ain't just saying that you sound.  They miss you.  And they miss you.  That's why you're laying on your back.  Looking at the roof of the church.  We should tell them the truth of the hate.  Y'all gonna make me lose my mind.  Up in here.  Up in here.  Y'all gonna make me go all out.  Up in here.  Up in here.  Y'all gonna make me act so cool.  Up in here.  Up in here.  Y'all gonna make me lose my goals.  Up in here. 
[01:39:30]  Up in here.  Off the train.  I need to step in.  That's the sickest sound ever.  I eat kids, people, dogs.  I don't care.  Mothers and their babies.  I will eat everybody.  Y'all gonna make me lose my mind.  Mike has a translation on line 11.  Mike, what's up?  Yeah, I think he was trying to talk about how much he loved his family. 
[01:40:00]  And he hates the white people.  I mean, I gotta revert back to Jurassic Park 2 Lost World.  We should crank his ass up and send him back out to the island.  The only way we're gonna be safe.  All right.  We're gonna make the island and crank his ass up.  I gotta get back to Skull Island.  Thank you, Mike.  Somebody was mad at me for giving the ending to King Kong.  DC from Staten Island writes,  ONA, does Tyson take pills of Zoloft or is he giving it with a tranquilizer gun? 
[01:40:30]  Look at that bugger.  Because someone has to tell him that he's got to go back on the Zoloft after the fight.  I don't think he's doing it on his own.  Yeah, really.  Imagine that.  Here, take this.  Mike, what you trying to give me, poison?  Because he says, like, his trainers and stuff take him off the Zoloft,  so they're taking the pills away.  Who's the brave soul that has to tell him,  well, all right, Mike, fight's over.  Probably just inject it in the big piece of raw meat they throw into his cage after the fight.  Oh, I feel better. 
[01:41:00]  Okay, let me out.  Hey, Rob, what's up?  Hey, what's happening?  You guys can't possibly think that's a good drug.  Anthony, you're saying it's the greatest drug.  Someone goes off it, they kill people.  Really?  Free Hartman killed Bill Hartman when she went off the Zoloft.  Man, and she was like a quiet little girl.  Imagine what Tyson could do off the drugs.  That's what I'm saying.  He's really cool.  He will kill us all.  I think he's a military experiment.  They're giving him the Zoloft,  and then if we ever get into war with someone,  they take him off and parachute him in behind enemy lines,  and he just tears up the cities. 
[01:41:30]  It would work well.  He's like Gorgo.  Gorgo.  Remember Gorgo?  Oh, my God.  The Godzilla ripoff.  Remember that?  Gorgo with the little fin ears and everything.  I forgot all about Gorgo.  He's Gorgo.  When you're in the Zoloft, you're the mellowest creature in the world.  You're like a tame rabbit.  And they take Tyson off of it to fight.  That's what I'm saying.  It should be illegal.  I thought I could bring a gun into the ring.  There should be a huge fence around the ring 
[01:42:00]  so he doesn't hurt the spectators.  A cage back.  Only the audience is in the cage.  Reject him.  Come on out, you pussies.  I'll chew right through that chain rink.  Hey, Mr. Tyson.  Yeah?  While we have you in the studio,  how do you spell Zoloft?  Zoloft.  R-O-L-A-I-D-S.  I don't know.  How do you spell it?  I don't know, but you better give me some quick.  And why do I have this tag in my ear?  I woke up with a tag in my ear with a number  and a radio transmitter on my back. 
[01:42:30]  I think that is to track my migration habits.  They want to know where Mike goes in between fights.  I like in the warm weather, I go north.  And in the cold weather, I go south.  And they track me with my little antenna on my back.  But sometimes I rub against a tree and dislodge it  and they have to tranquilize me 
[01:43:00]  and put a new transmitter on my back.  That's when I need more Zoloft.  You ever see him do that on the Wild Kingdom show  with the bear?  They give him the tranquilizer  and all of a sudden his lip gets all loopy  and his tongue sticks out of his mouth?  You ought to see when the Mike Tyson looks like that.  They had to pull me out of a cave once  with a come-along  and they measured me  and pulled one of my twofers out 
[01:43:30]  to see how old I was.  And they woke me up  and you should have saw them bastards run  when I started coming too.  They ran for the hills.  They were petrified.  I'm on the Zoloft thing, right?  But I'm on that to keep me from killing y'all.  Yeah.  You better give me more.  I remember once  I was looking for food at the local dump 
[01:44:00]  and it was dangerous for the children  so they put me in a cage  on the back of a pickup truck  and relocated me.  But I kept coming back  because that was some tasty-ass garbage.  You can't keep me away  from a good  old Swanson TV dinner  half-eating thing at the dump.  I love that S. 
[01:44:30]  I got one for you.  Yeah.  You think that crocodile hunter has balls?  Give him some Zoloft  and have him  wrestle with Tyson  and give him the Zoloft  to calm him down.  Then I would be impressed.  Screw those goddamn alligators  he's wrestling with.  Crocodiles are pussies.  Right.  They can't even punch.  Damn crocodile hunter.  Let's see you take care of Tyson.  Get some Zoloft in him.  See, the funny thing  about the Tyson jaw  is its power isn't in opening. 
[01:45:00]  It's in closing.  So you can actually hold it shut  with your bare hands  but don't let it open  because I'll take your fingers off.  Fingers off, Zoloft, whatever.  It's on the floor.  I know.  Come here, you little  was-y-dance-y.  He's ready to go  and do a death fight.  He's going into a death row.  All right. 
[01:45:30]  Yes.  I'm reverting myself  to Hannibal Lecter.  I need like a muzzle or something.  Some Zoloft.  Let's take a break.  All right.  And we'll be back.  Nice, baby.  Nice second in  from over here.  Nice, nice, baby.  Oh, it's so nice.  Nice, nice, baby.  Oh.  Come here, come here.  Come here, come here.  Come here, come here.  Nice, nice, baby. 
[01:46:00]  Oh.  Nice, nice, nice.  Oh.  Nice, nice, nice.  I'll make a hit  of my height.  Nice, nice, nice.  Gotta love this night.  Oh.  That's not not.  That's not not.  That's not not.  Look at it, look at it.  Look at it, look at it.  Look at it, look at it.  Look at it, look at it.  I'm over here now.  Hey, I'm over here now. 
[01:46:30]  I gotta have that.  Hey, I'm over here now.  I got your legs.  Okay, terrific.  Don't just stare at it here.  Just look at me like a tit with bull.  He's a jekyll, six points, is this?  He's a dumbass.  I'm good like that, my friend. 
[01:47:00]  Look what we did to you again.  You know, I can go on to that.  You've got to give me a cup.  Isn't that nice?  You want that, right?  Yeah, it's nice.  It's beautiful.  I need it on CG form.  Let me introduce everyone else, even though no one else is going to be able to talk.  I need one for performance and one for pleasure.  We have Jim Norton, who's becoming a star.  Nice.  You better watch.  He's becoming a star over there. 
[01:47:30]  That's the whole point.  The headline material.  Becoming a star on our show, thanks to you.  You introduced us to Norton.  That's the whole idea from opening for me.  And we've got Kimmy from Survivor to your left.  Uh-huh.  Nice, huh?  Nice.  Yeah, she's very nice.  You're not feeling it with her, though.  No, I didn't even get starved.  What am I supposed to be all over this board?  You like the lip?  She's got a nice lip.  She's got a light...  The bottom lip, when she closes it, looks like you've got a nice drag on it.  You know, for the underside.  Nice drag. 
[01:48:00]  You know what I'm talking about.  I know.  I know.  When they pull up slow, like...  We understand the drag.  You know what I mean?  Put a pop at the top.  You know what I mean?  That's how you do.  I wonder if CBS could use that.  Oh, yeah.  I'm a doing crew in here, too.  Yeah, you are.  You don't like the CBS?  Yes.  I don't have a problem with them, but, you know, I didn't bring them in here.  I don't even know this guy.  They're not even...  That could be anybody.  They're not even focused on you.  I don't even know them.  What if they don't focus on them?  What are we talking about them for?  They're here for Kimmy.  All right.  We'll let them talk to Kimmy. 
[01:48:30]  Good.  This is our chance at national exposure.  We're going to be part of this.  You seem to get ice for this, Kimmy.  You keep looking over here.  Kimmy's hot.  I'm not saying she's not hot.  She must be half a fag or something.  Look at her.  I see stuff like this all the time.  All right, all right, all right.  I'm not you.  This is what I do.  Like that, yeah?  Like this.  They're all over the joint.  I mean, she's hot.  You know, but...  Guys, your pants are really...  I've been with her before.  Maybe a different hairstyle, different height. 
[01:49:00]  Guys, genitals.  What's up with your pants?  Millennium.  What's up with your pants?  Millennium.  They're big.  32-inch.  They're huge.  Look at those bells.  Look, you've got these big...  The pants, but they're not bell bottoms.  They're that size the whole way up.  Well, let's figure it out.  They're like tree trees.  Let's figure what out.  Let's figure what out.  What grade are you in?  What do you mean?  Figure what out?  The back of them have big pockets.  What are you talking about?  The whole leg is a pocket.  Wait, you've got pockets on them, too?  Oh, yeah.  Which way?  Bosco or you bet? 
[01:49:30]  I'd say you bet.  You bet?  Yeah.  You see what I mean?  Yeah.  I guess.  Yeah.  Now, why, though?  Bosco or you bet?  Which way?  You bet.  You bet.  What about the Bosco?  That's all I say.  That's it?  I'm not.  Nah, nah.  That's all I say.  Oh.  I don't understand.  Maybe I'll dress like you.  No.  In crap brown.  That's green.  This is green.  I've got to take my glasses off. 
[01:50:00]  Pine tree green he's wearing.  All right.  Go for him.  We had a photo shoot.  She's at three.  You're looking good today.  I'm not saying it's normal.  But you've got cartoon figures on your pants.  Yeah, exactly.  It's millennium.  What's cool about that?  It's got a vibe.  Yeah.  Juvenile.  See, you were upset.  What?  She's calling you juvenile.  You bet you were back in school, right?  Yeah, yeah.  You know, you're not supposed to grow up and be like this.  Oh, yeah.  We're so grown up.  Look it up.  He's like in a normal shirt. 
[01:50:30]  What's wrong with that?  You could be an accountant.  I don't have to impress anyone.  He's got the chest hair hanging out.  Guys, it's not like you've got to go around dressed like a superhero all the time.  No, I wear what I wear.  And you've got some bling bling on it.  What's the bling bling all about?  Yeah, you've got a little, you've got some bling bling around your neck.  Some ice bling bling thing.  What do you got on there?  The lion.  The lion?  The big old Leo.  Get your hands off me.  That's harassment.  That's harassment.  It only works when I touch them, right? 
[01:51:00]  Did you catch that CBS?  She was looking at your lion, Madeline.  That's male harassment.  Yes, it is.  She grabbed your lion.  Yeah, well, then what?  She want to pet it.  You know what I mean?  The next thing it's in the Enquirer and there's a whole thing and she's making money.  Things could be worse.  That's how they earned today.  Things could be worse.  You know what I mean?  She brings her lips with her.  You know what I mean?  She survived.  Hey, ask her a survivor question so they can get it on CBS.  Oh, we're going to trust him.  Sure. 
[01:51:30]  Why?  Okay.  Go ahead.  You've got some kind of reputation, Dice, or something.  About what?  I don't know.  She seems to think you're not capable of asking a legit question that CBS would air on their  TV show.  Yeah, they're filming right now, Dice.  You're under pressure.  Mm-hmm.  Don't worry.  You look good.  You're handsome.  All right, now ask her a question.  We all know that.  Of course.  Like about the show.  But aren't you off the show?  They threw you off the show?  Yeah, I got thrown off.  So I can come over here and play with you guys.  Yeah, so?  Why'd they throw you off?  Because I didn't play well with others. 
[01:52:00]  Why not?  What's your problem with people?  She doesn't like me.  What's your problem with people?  What's my problem with people?  I'm not a doormat.  No, no, no.  You know what I think it is?  Why?  That your whole life, you're walking around, everybody's like looking at you going, oh, I've got to get in there.  And you know that.  Oh, no.  So the minute you're on the island all, you know, rolling around in mud and you got a little dirty, nobody's paying any attention.  So you had an attitude, so they got rid of you.  No, I'm just familiar with you.  That's what happens.  That's not what happens.  No.  That's not what happens. 
[01:52:30]  I like it.  I'm wrong.  You don't like that.  I kind of like that.  That's what's wrong.  You know how pretty girls are.  Like, God forbid you don't do what they tell you to do because, you know, because they got back.  That's the most sense you've ever made in your life.  That's the way it goes.  But she didn't look pretty on the island.  Exactly.  So everybody was treating her, as you said, like a doormat.  She got an attitude about it, like, God forbid, you know, where's my mascara?  You know what I mean?  And the minute she didn't look all hotsy-totsy, good to go, horny like Harriet, you know what I mean? 
[01:53:00]  She threw an attitude and they said, get rid of her.  Now, she tends bar out on Long Island, so obviously behind the bar the guys are looking at her all the time.  They're throwing the tits, she's got the cleavage going here, you know what I mean?  And then she goes to the island, wearing the main pants.  She might have a point here.  No, you know what?  I hate to say it because it's coming out of Dice, but I think she's got a point.  Nobody was looking that good.  She's wearing the pink lettuce specials, you know what I mean? 
[01:53:30]  Hey, she smelled on the island, too.  You're not high maintenance?  I wasn't smelling high maintenance.  You're not high maintenance.  You've got a boyfriend.  I'll do it myself.  No, I'm dating.  What do you mean you're doing?  Is that a nice thing your parents could be listening?  You'll do it yourself.  No, no, my parents are way upstate.  What kind of filthy, dirty thing is that to say?  That's millions of people.  Hey, what's the matter if a girl wants to take care of us?  No, no, there's nothing wrong with it, but why is she talking about it?  See what I mean?  Now, any guy that might be interested in you is going, I don't want to go with this, slob.  She's talking about taking off on the air.  Isn't that good?  You know what I mean? 
[01:54:00]  Or masturbation.  Can I say, J.O. is good.  J.O. is good.  J.O. is good.  She's talking about releasing Volvomania.  You know what it was, Dave?  You know I know what I'm talking about.  The night of the conversation, I was the only one that said something that was actually  permitted on family television.  There's a lot of other stuff that was said that night about girls doing their thing  to their boys with implements, okay?  What? 
[01:54:30]  Wait a minute, what?  All right, we can get into this.  Like back or the front?  Well, if the girl was using it, well, I don't know.  Another thing for your parents to hear.  That's nice.  Obviously, she wasn't going in the front.  So she had some kind of a device.  Yeah.  And she was doing the boyfriend.  This was on the show.  And this was disgusting.  They edited it out.  Too messy for family care.  That's what they always say.  If a girl wants to lay there.  I just can't believe that people even believe that.  And pet the poodle.  What's wrong with that?  Guys, have you had a girl do that to you?  What?  You know, the apparatus? 
[01:55:00]  No, no, no.  You don't like that?  No.  I like straight vicious banging.  A little tickle with the pinky?  It starts off with an argument mid-afternoon and ends with a vicious banging.  That's how it should be.  That's any good relation.  You're a hopeless romantic.  Yeah, exactly.  I got the high school sweetheart syndrome.  You know what I mean?  You throw the flowers at them.  Now look what I gave you.  Now open up.  You know?  Show me the paper.  I told you when I called them that you've got to keep constant testicles coming at them. 
[01:55:30]  That's the only way to keep a relationship going.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, that's it.  It's got to always...  You can't let them breathe.  Fire, fire, fire the whole time, right?  Yeah, constantly.  Wherever they go.  They go to the broom closet.  There you are.  Oh, look what I got.  My testicles are out of my pants.  Come in here a minute.  Come on.  Your family awaits you to cob the turkey.  You know what I mean?  You've got to always be there.  You've got to sneak up.  Well, let's ask Kimmy.  You're in there for a while. 
[01:56:00]  You know, sleep with your head at their feet.  So when they go to hug you in the middle of the night, hey, kid, it's right in the upper.  Into what?  Are you into what Dice is saying?  Is this the way to romance a fine woman like yourself?  Well, you talk in between.  You know, hey, I'm the one that's in the closet also saying, hey, you, get on your knees.  Oh, really?  You know where your mind really is, sweetheart.  I know where mine is.  Absolutely.  Don't give me this Ivory Snow girl next to her bull crap.  She hasn't given that.  I have not given that.  If it feels good, it's good. 
[01:56:30]  Absolutely.  And you know what?  The woman could be the arrestor and the initiator as well.  Thank God.  There's nothing wrong with that.  She's going to flash us a little while.  So move over.  That's fine by me because at this age, when I'm on top, if I get tired, I just hop off.  You know what I mean?  What am I trying to prove already?  Do we have to get him the horny goat weed?  Right.  You don't care about making the girl feel good?  Well, they're always fair.  You know, I'm going to have my tent orgasm.  No, you're not.  You know what I mean?  We're tent. 
[01:57:00]  Where's the first?  You want to see orgasm?  Look around the room.  Look at the carpet.  Look at your hair, your face, your sister's head.  You know what I mean?  That's an orgasm.  There's the proof, you filthy slob.  You know what I mean?  What can I do with you?  Wear a stamp?  But you're going to do it for the 10th time.  Quite the 10th time, we need a snorkel in this room.  Dirty animals try to come off like nuns. 
[01:57:30]  But you've got to do, you know, one good turn deserves another.  You've got to finish the job.  You've got to return the favor.  You never finish with them.  You never finish?  There's no real proof.  They could say whatever they want.  That's why I don't understand, guys.  That's why I don't understand.  When a guy is in bed with a girl afterwards, he's going, uh, did you?  Yeah, don't question it.  She gave you a couple squeals and a moaner?  Good.  She had a good time. 
[01:58:00]  Go to sleep.  I want to call my friends now and tell them what I did to you again.  Hey, why is Norton so quiet over there?  Oh, my God.  No, because he's a little, he's a little wild today.  Oh, yeah.  What's wrong with Norton?  There's a lot of leakage.  Yeah, I'm in a really foul, vicious, perverted mood today.  That's why he's enjoying what I'm saying.  Yeah.  You want to share with the, what they call the filthy animals?  I'm just cranky and I'm really horny.  Wow.  So are the rest of us.  Come on, share.  Whoa. 
[01:58:30]  You don't know what he could do to you.  He even said that like a goody two-shoes.  Come on.  I can't see it.  Come on.  What is that?  You got to talk sexy, baby.  You got to put a certain tone in your voice.  You know that.  What, like that?  No, not like me.  I'm a guy.  You're sexy.  Come on.  Hi, guys.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I thought you were talking to me for a second.  I got confused.  I was.  You know what?  What happened to the CBS film crew?  They ran and fled.  They fled the studio.  They gave up on their idea, I guess. 
[01:59:00]  Yeah, we're going to use this.  Another network will never be on again.  So, you know what I mean?  You got to hang.  You got to be loose about it.  You know what I mean?  The looks are okay.  You're okay.  Geez, you're looking at her like, you know, like.  I'm just saying.  Look at everybody else in the room and look at me.  I'm a lot better than.  No, no, you're a very pretty girl.  There's nothing wrong with you statistically.  We'll show you.  It's not a girl's in here.  It's not a girl's in here.  And on the calculator, you're gorgeous. 
[01:59:30]  Statistically?  No, you know what I mean.  Like on the monitor, whatever it would be.  What is it?  You don't.  What are you going to make me start thinking?  By me.  All right.  We understand.  Do you know what I'm talking about?  I'm not a girl.  Like regimentally, she would be that good looking.  Like in today's standards.  He equals MC hot?  Yeah.  Where?  Exactly.  I mean, my hair's washed.  I smelt it when I came in.  You saw that.  You know what I mean?  She's got good cheekbones. 
[02:00:00]  Sure.  You know, she's got the dragging lips.  Nice.  She's got pretty eyes that you would go, you know, this is a girl that maybe some serious  could go on.  Like a nice girl.  You know, and then you date at three weeks and you walk in and she's with three Mexicans  in the room.  You got me mad last week.  You know, that's what happens.  Don't tick me off.  All right.  Would you tempt us?  You have a bad temper.  I could see.  You're hiding it.  No.  Yeah, there were things going on. 
[02:00:30]  You got issues, sweetheart.  Are you a hidden bitch?  No, but you...  It's not even that.  I'll play dirty pool.  If somebody, you know...  Oh, boy.  What do you mean dirty pool?  Like, if you got mad at dice...  I like poor punches.  Like what?  If you got mad at dice, would you bang the opener to get him back?  You know what?  I just might do it and videotape it and everything.  You know what?  She's got good gums, too.  You like that?  Yeah, she's got good teeth.  That's the first thing you look at.  Teeth and gums.  That's a good thing in a girl. 
[02:01:00]  No pyorrhea.  You don't need anything, right?  Pyorrhea.  You don't need that.  Yeah, like her gums aren't degrading.  You know what I mean.  Oh, it's some form of degrading, not the gums.  It's degrading, sure.  Instead of her gums.  You know what I mean?  You know what I mean?  No, she's hot looking.  Thank you.  You know, for you.  For him.  But not for that.  No, I don't see her with Anthony.  I see her more with Opie.  They're like...  They could be like the all-American couple.  That's a compliment.  Oh, you get that kind of...  This could be like the new Lee Majors in Farrah Fort.  You know what I mean?  Remember, they were like clean cut. 
[02:01:30]  Like, wow, look at them.  You look more like Lee Majors than I.  No, no.  But you got that, like, all-American...  Like, you could have been a ball player.  You know what I mean?  That kind of thing.  All right.  So, Kimmy, if there was a guy...  You're going out with a guy.  Yeah.  And he doesn't have sex with another girl.  But he's maybe in a bar, making out or something.  Do you then instantly go bang the first guy you see to get back at him?  Oh, no.  No?  Oh, no.  What do you do?  She bangs the first 15.  Like, I want to know what level you would take your vengeance to. 
[02:02:00]  Would it be equal or greater than what he did?  It would be when he's not suspecting it.  That's for sure.  She would go for his best friend.  No, I wouldn't go for the friend because then that just gets way too dirty at end.  What's the body language?  You see how both the hands went between the legs like this now?  Yeah, what does that mean?  No, I would go and look for bigger and better.  Bigger and better?  Mm-hmm.  You're talking downstairs?  Oh, yeah.  Let me tell you.  What do you mean?  Black.  Oh, God.  It was just one 14-inch worm, and it was in the Outback. 
[02:02:30]  That was the only job.  Yeah, but think of what you've got to be built like for that to fit in all that crap.  Oh, man.  Look at Norton just like, oh, you filthy poor.  Look, yeah.  But think of that.  Norton, speak up, because you've got some thoughts in that head.  Norton, you're looking at that mouth.  I saw you.  Yeah, it's nice.  It makes me very happy.  I don't know how nice a gun would look at that type of thing.  Norton would do whatever with that mouth and then punch every tooth out of it.  No, I wouldn't.  She's very nice.  She's very, very wonderful.  Oh, yeah?  Thank you.  She's a pleasant girl, but listen to what she's saying. 
[02:03:00]  Don't go by the cover.  No.  Right.  See, you know what?  There's nothing wrong with somebody that enjoys sex.  There's nothing wrong with somebody that enjoys sex.  I'm not saying you're talking about stuffing 14 inches.  Kids don't come out 14 inches long.  Do you understand?  And you want to stuff 14 inches in there, plus two big bulldog balls?  Come on.  No, it wouldn't fit.  It would not fit.  You're absolutely right.  And the balls are just juggling anyway.  You know, you get some slap action with them. 
[02:03:30]  We're going to have to be careful with the way we're describing it.  She doesn't know radio technology like me.  Yeah, you've laid out three things that probably got dumped, Dice.  All right, listen.  Why would you say that?  And two big yams.  She's got a mouth like a snake, Dice.  Speaking about all that, I've got to wish my parents a happy anniversary.  Today's their anniversary.  Like the way you're talking.  No, I don't mean what I'm saying.  You know, it's their anniversary, and I want to wish them a nice happy anniversary. 
[02:04:00]  Shut up when I'm talking to them.  Chris, what's up?  This is the best radio ever.  Wow, look at that.  This is the best I've heard since day one.  Wow, look at that.  You rock, Kim.  You rock.  All right, Chris.  Thank you.  CCO from Brooklyn.  You know?  Big up.  CCO representing.  We've got to take a quick break, okay?  All right, man.  Whatever you've got to do.  I'll still be on.  We have Stalker Patty.  Hey, your girlfriend's here, Norton. 
[02:04:30]  Oh, Stalker Patty.  Patty, remember you felt her up?  Yeah.  Oh, that's right.  Dice is here for that day.  She's got a new attitude, this chick.  Yeah, I know.  I've noticed.  She got her ass taken, a photograph taken for the contest.  Yeah, and now she's like, she's bad-mouthing Opie now and stuff.  It's been nice.  It's kind of cool.  Speaking of asses, the best ass winner is here.  You showed us.  You want to see a good ass, Dice?  Mm-hmm.  All right.  What's his name?  What does that mean now?  I don't know.  It's kind of a joke.  That would be, wouldn't it?  That would be. 
[02:05:00]  It would be.  See, that's the humor in it.  Oh, here we go.  Yeah, we'll talk to her next.  We've got a break, though.  Stay there.  I feel stupid.  Oh, so stupid.  I feel stupid and dumb and dumb.  Opie and Ashley.  We've got a smile on our face and a head up our ass.  102.7 WNEW.  Yeah, yeah.  Jimmy from Survivor. 
[02:05:30]  Andrew Dice Clay.  Jim Norton.  So I've got to watch my language a little, huh?  Yeah, they dumped out of a lot of that last segment.  Some of the best stuff.  This is what I mean.  And Anthony laughs at me when I use radio technology.  You don't use the technology.  No, I do.  And, you know, I went off a little.  He was talking about, like, big bullies and stuff.  And the thing with, when you're talking about positioning, like we were saying, like, the horse and stuff.  This is medical terms that one of them doctors came up with. 
[02:06:00]  Ah, nah, nah.  Listen.  When you're talking about technology.  Ah, nah, nah.  I'm only here to everybody saying, I don't know.  I can sound like my ex-wife's lawyer, please.  I can sound like my ex-wife's lawyer, but I can sound like my ex-wife's lawyer, but I can't talk about things in certain contexts when you say going in.  Now, I'm just saying it like going in the front door of a house.  But in certain places when you say, no, no, they're not that stupid. 
[02:06:30]  No, but it could be like them cowboy doors.  You know where they had the two doors?  Yeah, you go in.  I love those doors.  You know what I mean?  Aren't those great doors?  Don't you watch bars still handle?  Those are the best.  Thanks.  And that's how I see every time, you know, I'm with a woman.  It's like cowboy doors.  Cowboy doors.  It just doesn't have the shutters.  It's the HIV corral.  Cowboy doors.  Cowboy doors.  I love it. 
[02:07:00]  You know, and then I'm not going to say nothing because I don't want to get beeped on it.  Fuzzy cowboy.  Fuzzy.  Yeah, where do you stand on that?  The fuzz?  Oh, we actually played that.  We played that.  Oh, really?  The choices were a regular triangle, a mohawk, a Hitler mustache, or the JonBenet.  No, it was like the boomerang.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, but we like keeping it easy now.  Yeah.  The strong girl I went with, it was ridiculous. 
[02:07:30]  She used to lay there and just twirl it with her fingers.  She actually was with the rollers in it before we'd leave.  We said that looks like a Final Force in the 70s look.  We said that looks like a pool rack flat.  And when I would see it, I'd go like this.  Hey, where's the ass girl?  I don't know.  You played that game already?  Yes, we played that last week.  It looks like Fidel Castro eating a London broil.  You know what I mean?  No.  Right?  I had a girl like that one time. 
[02:08:00]  The last time I saw her c*** was selling pot in Jamaica.  Oh, no, man.  Wait, that's not radio stuff.  I don't know what he even said.  Wait a minute.  Wait, let them get it down.  You better get that.  Wait, what did you say?  Don't say it.  Wait, wait.  Did you use the C word?  Yeah.  You can't say that?  No, you can't say the C word.  John Linton's comb.  Oh, I'm sorry.  What the hell is he doing?  I thought you, I couldn't possibly imagine you used that word.  So I'm like, what?  I'm trying to figure out what he said. 
[02:08:30]  We all looked at each other like, what the?  What did he say?  All right, start over, Jim.  Clean it up.  Yeah, clean it up.  Be a comedian.  The last time I saw her...  No, the last time she combed...  No.  Wait, wait, wait.  You said if you say comb...  No, no, wait, wait, wait, wait.  You whisper the word.  No, but if you say comb in the sentence, you could use the other word.  No.  No.  You can't say that.  You can't.  It's tricky.  It's tricky.  I didn't know either.  I'm sorry. 
[02:09:00]  Oh, my God.  I'm sorry.  Yes.  All right.  Now, what were you trying to say, Jim?  You don't need dices out.  No, no, but just talking about a girl, very hairy, and the last time I saw her baby maker,  it was selling pot in Jamaica.  It was a Rastafarian's record.  I like it the other way better.  Yeah, me too.  Well, of course.  Well, he'll do it the other way at Westbury Music Fair this weekend when he warms up.  See, I didn't even do a plug yet.  I helped you out there.  Of course.  That's right, Westbury. 
[02:09:30]  I forgot why he even came to New York.  That was a freebie for you.  I was on the plane.  I'm going, why am I going there?  Are you doing it in the round?  That's the only way they do it there.  It spins.  So it spins?  Aren't you going to get dizzy and fall down?  Yeah, but I'm already dizzy, so, you know.  So it'll equal everything else.  I'm going to spin around the other way real fast.  How many shows did I do at Westbury Reading?  Happy Life?  50?  At least 50.  I've done a lot of...  I did a...  Might I add that the legend always sells out because he is a star?  Ah, there you go.  Thank you. 
[02:10:00]  Happy face.  It's happy face.  Yes, we all know.  He's stunned.  Madison Square Garden, the Beacon Theater, Rose Bowl with Guns N' Roses.  Shall I continue?  No, no.  You know, people are starting to say, funniest radio ever, so don't wreck it.  Exactly.  How about that?  They're wearing matching shoes.  Excuse me, Mr. Opie.  I can't help it that he's a legend and that he goes up in front of thousands of people and  entertains them.  That's not my fault.  I'm just saying what the truth is.  I just lay the facts out. 
[02:10:30]  Do you understand me?  Happy.  Get away from that.  What do you get called?  Well, respect.  Well, respect.  Where do you get the name Happy?  He's never happy.  He's very happy.  When was Dice disrespected?  Dice wasn't disrespected.  Yeah, there was no disrespected.  Yeah, now he's yelling.  Happy face.  Come on.  The simple fact that you can't see how he was disrespected is disrespectful.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  No, come on.  What if he ever happened?  What if there was a problem?  It's not a problem.  Happy.  The guy gave us a beautiful plug.  There'll be a Westbury Friday and Saturday.  Right.  We are having a fun time with Dice. 
[02:11:00]  We're having a good time.  We got this island chick with us.  It's Kimmy Dice.  You know, the island girl.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  She could come.  You want to come to the show?  I want to come to the show.  Sit in the front row.  I'll tell you what I really think.  Okay.  What do you think?  I'll really get in there nice for you.  All right.  You'll be slipping off that chair.  So check out our best ass winner.  Let's see.  All right.  This is the lovely Allison.  She won the best ass contest.  We put photos of her ass on the website. 
[02:11:30]  Nice, right?  Show it to Norton now.  Nicely nice.  Oh, that makes me very happy.  Bite it like a Macintosh apple.  I just want to put saran wrap over my face and take it like a man.  Oh, that's right.  That's where it's like a patty.  He wants to touch it.  No, I wouldn't touch it.  What do you do?  What about a poke?  Besides what?  Wait a minute.  Let me answer.  Besides your ass work, whatever you do with that.  What do you do?  What do you do?  Hey, she just got divorced today. 
[02:12:00]  So let's give her a round of applause for that.  There's something new.  Oh, so you're not divorced yet?  No.  The minute you stop bouncing on a stranger's bag, consider it over.  You know what I mean?  And then everybody dents.  You know what I mean?  That's what happened.  Yeah.  You know how people are always looking for problems.  Right.  Yeah, no, I was in the, with the, with the, what do they call them? 
[02:12:30]  Where you get gas, the gas station.  But the gas station, are you brain damaged?  Yeah, the gas station.  How do you forget these things?  What is that thing?  No, well, you know, they put different things.  So I'm with my lady, right?  And the guy looks in the window.  He's like, fill her up.  I got out.  I wrapped the nozzle around this guy's neck.  Oh, you don't open your mouth.  You don't know her.  You know, and then everybody dents.  You know what I mean? 
[02:13:00]  This is why there's so many problems in the world.  Yeah, okay.  Nobody knows when to keep that mouth shut.  Right.  You're just asking if you want to guess.  You know what I mean?  It's like I was with, I'm at one of these outdoor cafes.  Yeah.  I'm with my lady.  You cafe?  Right.  You know what I'm talking about.  Like an outdoor luncheonette.  Right.  And, you know, my wife goes, what time is it?  So before I even answer, the guy sitting at the next table goes, 3.30. 
[02:13:30]  I'm looking, when you're getting involved, I start smacking him in the face with the table.  You know, like he's trying to make me look bad.  Like, I don't know the time.  And everybody dents.  I just took her out to, you know, give her some wine, have a couple laps.  You know, you're going to have a couple laps, right?  Even if you're manicuring someone, right?  Probably take your foot, do something down there.  Yeah.  You know, get the tip.  Allison, what was the problem with your marriage? 
[02:14:00]  What was the problem that you had to get a divorce?  I can't go there, right?  Oh, yeah.  Give us a call.  Pending litigation, right?  Pending litigation.  We're good.  Everybody gets nervous, you know, when they're being sued.  Yeah, they call pending litigation.  We're trying to get everything from them.  We're good like that.  What happened?  He got everything.  Yeah, but you got that.  Got you married the first time.  It'll get you to Westbury.  Brian, what's going on?  Brian.  Guys, I call him once in a while, but this is the funniest radio I've ever heard in my entire life. 
[02:14:30]  Dude, you can see the ass we're looking at.  It's just really lovely.  And his name is Andrew Dice Clay, and we'll be it.  Andrew Dice Clay is a staple of comedy.  Right.  He's funny.  He's a funny guy, but he's so bald, but he can't accept it.  Take it easy, Diamond Duck.  Good for you.  At least he's got a job.  What do you want to do?  It's a happy face.  It's okay.  He's got in that head for $5 an hour, you punch, you bum. 
[02:15:00]  Shut your mouth.  By the way, sir, he's not going bald.  He had hair, but your mother pulled it out while he was f***ing her.  You can't say that word.  Wait a minute.  You can't say that.  You can't say that.  Can they beep that?  I think they got it.  They can beep it for the replay.  Hey?  Sugar.  Dice was doing who went to what, and then what happened?  Yeah.  My friend, I get very defensive. 
[02:15:30]  No, it's okay.  It's all right.  It's all right.  Look at your head.  It's okay.  What's wrong with his head?  It's awful.  My head really looks like a turtle's erection.  My head stinks.  No, you've got a great head.  I don't.  It's all head-like.  I know.  It's like a head-like.  Do you know what I mean?  Kimmy, do you like his head?  It's like you look at his head, and you're going, ha, ha, ha.  I don't know structure.  No, you're just saying, I love the shaved head because then you can rip your hands over  the stubble.  It's the chemo count.  Love that.  You know what it is?  There's no real fit.  My head looks like a cancerous donkey testicle. 
[02:16:00]  There's no real structure to it.  You know what?  That's the only thing missing.  Structure.  Yeah.  It goes any which way.  Yeah.  Fat pill.  We just need some mold and stuff.  What's wrong, Norton?  Nothing.  I just had a...  I thought we were all having fun.  I'm having a very good time.  Her ass is really nice, though, man.  You want us to break soccer, Patty, until you calm back down?  That was definitely...  That's definitely the king and the yang, yeah.  Let's see what Patty looks like.  Of course, we all remember Patty was spelt up for the first time by a man, by anybody. 
[02:16:30]  How old is she?  It was Jim Norton.  She's in her 40.  45.  She is a virgin.  And the first hands that were ever laid on her bare chest was Norton.  Look at this, Dice.  What a man.  I met her.  I met her.  Yeah?  You like, huh?  Nice.  Nice.  Patty, show Dice your ass.  She's not too tough, heavy, but baby got some back.  You like that, huh?  Patty, show Dice.  Every day you get to show her to her stuff.  You wearing a thong today, Patty?  No.  No?  All right, just show her, man. 
[02:17:00]  Show her.  Come on, man.  Come on.  Let's be nice.  She's got the sex appeal of stomach cancer.  See, they should get married.  They get along.  Right.  Right.  Look out.  She gives them, like, a little whack.  Patty's got a little barrette in her hair today.  Pulling it back.  Patty's okay.  She's cute.  Thank you.  I like it.  Now, show that ass.  Patty, come on.  Show the Dice, man.  Come on.  Do it.  There's no cameras in here.  Who's looking?  Don't be shy.  There you go.  No one's looking.  There we go.  There's got a log sticking out, is there? 
[02:17:30]  Come on.  You're Norton's girl.  Go ahead.  There you go.  Look at this, Dice.  Nice.  Nice.  Nice.  Nice.  It's like a whole thing.  It's a virgin bottom.  No, but you've got a whole thing going on down there.  Not bad, Patty.  Patty, no one's ever touched that.  You know, that could do as a good chill acting, I'll tell you.  Yeah.  Imagine that.  Imagine how she'd scream the first time.  45-year-old virgin right there.  That's the only ass that would be safe in a prison shower. 
[02:18:00]  That's his way of complimenting.  Patty, can I ask you something?  Are you wearing a little makeup today?  Yes, I am.  You are wearing a little, I see a little rouge on your cheeks.  Yes.  You've got some lipstick on.  It's my Avon.  And you've got a little eye shadow on, don't you?  Yes, it's my new Avon.  Patty, very nice.  Very nice.  Thank you.  Mm-hmm.  Stomach cancer still?  Mm-hmm.  With the makeup?  No, bowel.  Okay, he's moving out. 
[02:18:30]  Stop making fun of her.  I like her.  She's very nice.  That's my girl.  Thank you.  Patty's nice.  That's my girl.  All right.  Shoot an oyster right on that ass, everybody.  Don't call my winner.  Have a couple laughs with her.  You know what I mean?  That's my girl.  You wouldn't tie her down.  Is that what you're saying, Norton?  No, I wouldn't.  Patty's very nice.  Yeah.  Say something nice to her now.  I would definitely be willing to have sex with you if we both already had AIDS. 
[02:19:00]  You see what I mean?  That's sort of like a compliment.  There you go.  I like the compliment.  That's endearing.  That's sweet.  Norton, compliment her on one of her features.  Take a good look.  Compliment her on one of her...  Like, Kimmy has the beautiful eyes, the nice mouth, the nice rack, the nice butt, nice belly with the belly ring, nice hair.  I don't know what's going on between them.  There's a lot going on there.  What about Pat?  I like you because you have the posture of a Down syndrome vagina. 
[02:19:30]  What does that mean now?  She's a little round-shouldered, that's all.  A round-shouldered, you call her?  No one got that, though.  Of course, there's a weak bust line.  That's a weird...  Down syndrome.  See, you're right.  Right?  You're slouching, Patty.  Don't slouch.  See, now you're popping. 
[02:20:00]  Yeah, look at that, Patty.  Patty, you've got to start wearing bras, Patty.  No, you don't.  Yes, you do.  No, you don't.  No, you don't.  You want them to stand on their own.  No, I like it when breasts look like love handles.  I've never worn a bra.  They're so uncomfortable.  And who's looking?  You've never worn a bra in all your years?  Patty, will you talk into a microphone?  Find a microphone.  Find a microphone.  I'm sorry.  No, they're just uncomfortable. 
[02:20:30]  They never fit.  They never fit.  Too small.  You have to go to a bra place, a nice lingerie, so they'll measure you up and...  Oh, there's Miss Perfect down patty what to do now.  See what's going on, see?  What's that?  I'm trying to hang out.  She's like, you're stepping on her, like...  I do not.  Oh, like you're going to make her look like you.  I can...  Oh.  Come on, you see what I mean?  Kimmy, where do I get you in that audience?  She's got a lot of potential.  When I don't have to use technicology.  That's all. 
[02:21:00]  You're saying that Patty has potential.  Yes, I do.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  What would you do to her?  Adrienne, uh...  Potential?  First?  We will take her out and buy some clothes and get her to lift and put some bras.  Well, what's wrong with the clothes?  And when black jeans separates the meat pellets.  Is that good?  That's good.  That works.  She's got a nice casual gray shirt on.  Her hair's like beretted out.  You know what I mean?  And they're popping.  She's got sexy glasses. 
[02:21:30]  You know what I mean?  I just got you glasses.  Oh, man.  Glasses, too.  All right.  Let me tell you that right now.  Thank you.  I go right to your neck like an animal.  They should get a makeover to get her into...  Like a pit bull destroyer.  Yes, absolutely.  That's right.  A makeover.  I really believe that.  You get a guillotine and a house painter.  Let me go to jail.  The men and the girls are not a perfect 10.  I like Patty.  She knows I like her.  Tim, go ahead. 
[02:22:00]  Listen, Patty, you want to make the bra fit better?  Yeah.  Put it on backwards.  You know, in a way, he's got a point.  Yeah, there you go.  You know what I mean?  I always felt that was the one mistake.  Like that breast wearing on the back.  You know what I mean?  Because normally, you've got that face buried in the pillow, right?  So now you've got to start reaching around to play with these unessential things.  Normally, if they were right on the back, you could be squeezing them, get in there.  You know what I mean?  You know what?  They should be on the air, if you think about it. 
[02:22:30]  You know, so there's no stretching involved.  Boob boobs are one on each cheek.  You know what?  I'll tell you this.  Maybe they throw a pair on the front just to be ambidextrous.  Grab one in the front.  You grab one boob on her ass.  And everybody's dancing.  You know what I mean?  You know when you try to get a good grip and you start slamming them back?  If they were boobs on their butt, you'd just grab onto them like stick shifts. 
[02:23:00]  They'd say, get over here now.  And then you'd say like this.  You know what I mean?  That works for everybody.  This way, the girl's not going on.  You're pulling on me too hard.  Why, they say that to you?  Yeah.  And why is the face normally buried in the pillow for you?  Because you know what most of them look like without makeup.  Like you.  You don't like the face-to-face type?  No. 
[02:23:30]  What's wrong with the face-to-face?  I mean, now and then you get a good face.  But that's how dog invention was invented.  You know, dog style.  Oh, okay.  They confuse me sometimes.  Yeah, because you know, you see, like you can see a girl like Kim, like from behind.  So the hair looks great.  You know, everything looks perfect.  And then you run to meet her.  And only she's got a face, like by Joe's towing service.  So now you're stuck with her.  Now you've got to take her out.  So now you've got her home.  What am I going to do?  You know, that's what, you know, you stuff the face in the pillow. 
[02:24:00]  Sometimes that's good to do during missionary sex as well.  At the end of sex, it's really hot if she looks like Nicholson at the end of Cuckoo's Nest.  We have to take a break.  Dice playing with for a music pair.  I just think that works.  How do they get tickets, Dice?  Are tickets going to be almost sort of what?  Meet the meet.  How do you get tickets?  Let Pete talk.  Oh, okay.  You get tickets through Ticketmaster or at the box office.  Pete just got married.  Yeah?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, he just went on a honeymoon with her. 
[02:24:30]  Happy?  She's nice as wife.  Yeah, she's happy.  All right.  That's good.  All right, we've got to take a break.  What do you mean?  I have to take a break.  It went Italy.  Commercials.  All right, we'll talk about Italy next.  No, but he's got to go.  Where are you going?  I've got to go back to work.  Where do you work?  What do you do?  You want me to tell me what I really do?  I don't know what you do.  I don't do much.  What do you do, then?  I'm unemployed.  How would you like a punch in the face?  I'll open your mouth like that.  This guy followed me up, Dice.  I'm your biggest fan.  I put you on the radio.  Now he's going to want me to tell you what I really do. 
[02:25:00]  Now he's got a problem.  Stuff a potato in his mouth and throw him out of here.  I serve french fries at McDonald's.  Oh, do you really?  Yeah.  That's what Patty does.  Oh, I didn't mean nothing, then.  Hey, you're making fun of Patty's job.  Patty, you work at McDonald's?  Yeah.  Oh, look.  Now he's making a connection.  Patty, how long have you been at McDonald's?  Can I get a discount?  Talk into a microphone, Patty.  Patty, you're talking to this one.  Nice.  Talk together.  Who?  I'm up two years.  Two years.  And I'm looking to leave for another.  There's a lull now. 
[02:25:30]  I don't like when there's a lull.  All right.  That's why I want to take a break.  Take a break.  I'm doing over here.  That guy with the french fries.  Pizza meat.  Yes.  Dopey and Anthony show.  I think that might be part of the problem with society today.  Oh, I believe we're the problem.  I'm guilty, you stupid bitch.  Yeah, darn it.  1027.  WNEW.  Anthony?  Yeah.  Reagan's in the paper again today?  Yeah, I see.  It's reported in the Post and the Daily News. 
[02:26:00]  The Reagans, Nancy and Ron, marching 48 years of marriage together this coming weekend.  How about that?  And there's a picture of the lovely couple in the paper today.  And it looks like he's not doing too bad.  Ex-President Ronald Reagan is hit by wife Nancy on his 89th birthday, February 6th.  Look at his hands.  They are just leaning on the table.  She's got her hand behind his neck, turning his head towards her head.  And he's barely puckering his lips.  I don't think he even knows what he's doing in this picture, where he's kissing Nancy. 
[02:26:30]  And, oh my God, what happened to her?  What?  I mean, obviously, never a looker or anything, but, oh, looks like she's melting.  And what's going on there?  She looks like a chimpanzee.  Damn.  All right.  But there was some problems, I guess.  Yeah.  Let me read a little bit of this for you.  Just a little bit.  Because then we've got to get to Reagan.  He's on line 6th there.  Los Angeles, Ronald Reagan and wife Nancy celebrate their 48th wedding anniversary this weekend 
[02:27:00]  as the shadow of Alzheimer's disease dims the former president's golden years.  Oh, damn.  His motor skills have so deteriorated that he reportedly no longer exercises  and cannot recognize videotaped highlights of his political life, Anthony.  Ah, that's awful.  Former President Ford said in a TV interview that Reagan, 89, did not recognize him when the two met several months ago.  People Magazine today reports that Reagan appears to be entering the final phase of Alzheimer's disease. 
[02:27:30]  Ah.  We are afraid he might fall.  He walks around the garden.  And here's the kicker.  And occasionally, Mr. Reagan may try to stand in the pool.  What?  The former leader of the free world is attempting to walk on water.  He had his finger on the button at one point.  Yeah.  Fought the commies.  Right.  And now he's wandering the garden and standing in the pool.  Trying to stand in the pool, basically trying to walk on water, Anthony. 
[02:28:00]  That's great.  The focus of the day is Nancy.  And I don't think it will go beyond the year 2000 is what a few of the Reagan's friends are saying, Anthony.  Like that's the, they think two grand will be the year he checks out.  Yes.  Oh, that's a shame.  And he didn't even recognize Ford when Ford visited him recently.  President Ford?  Yeah.  Gerald.  Oh, wait a minute.  It was sad.  Ford said, I was there about 30 minutes.  Tried repeatedly to bring up incidents of our friendship that might stimulate some recognition by him. 
[02:28:30]  But tragically, it didn't help a bit.  The guy doesn't remember Ford.  No.  Well, I don't think much of America does either.  That's not saying much about Reagan's Alzheimer's.  I don't think much of us remember.  All right.  Well, let's go.  Ford is 86.  Yeah.  Reagan's 89.  And Ford.  Correct.  Yeah.  Oh, life.  And Ford was the guy, you know, falling down all the time.  Yeah.  And he thought he had Alzheimer's when he was in office. 
[02:29:00]  And he's doing better than Mr. Reagan.  So let's go to the live six, Anthony, and talk to the former president of the United States.  Anthony.  Why?  What are you doing?  I don't know.  I've got to go out here.  And it's not every day that the president calls a radio show.  I drank a lot of coffee.  I've got to take a leak.  See, hold him on the line.  I'll be right back.  All right.  Well, I hear someone on the line.  President Reagan.  President Reagan. 
[02:29:30]  Hello.  I'm Julie, your time-life operator.  Hey, Mr. Reagan.  What's going on today?  Hello.  How are you, sir?  I love anal sex.  No.  Yes.  What are you talking about?  Me and Nancy.  Yeah.  We just use Sam Donaldson's wig glue as lubricant.  Hello.  Yeah.  That's a visual we don't need today, sir.  Yes.  Oh, my God.  You twisted.  Fuck.  Oh, my God. 
[02:30:00]  Sorry.  I had to say that.  You had to dump out of your own show.  Yes, I did, because you're a twisted F talking about having anal sex with Nancy.  Yes, well, we have to keep it fresh after, well, how long has it been?  You're celebrating your 48th wedding anniversary this weekend.  Jesus Christ.  Yes.  48 years with that big, huge head.  My God.  48 years of, well, looking into the eyes of a bug-eyed alien. 
[02:30:30]  Did I ever tell you how we met?  No, you didn't.  Well, there was a big flash around Area 51.  I was driving, and her big-headed alien head stopped my dick up dead.  Well, I thought she was kind of cute and picked her up.  You ever screw an alien?  I can't say I have.  Wonderful.  Yeah.  Hello?  Alien abduction, huh, Mr. Reagan?  That's how we met. 
[02:31:00]  And I want to say something about Gerald Ford and what he said about me in the paper.  Okay.  That's not accurate.  No?  No.  He says you don't even recognize him when he comes around to visit.  I remember, Ford.  That was a transvestite bitch from Bangkok I nailed in 48.  I never forget a tight ass.  So he can lick me.  He can, huh?  Yes.  So are you guys doing anything special for your 48th wedding anniversary this weekend? 
[02:31:30]  Well, we're probably just going to sit around the house and play What's in Ron's Pants.  These days, it looks more like a turtle head caught in Christmas tinsel.  Oh, my God.  Goddamn this.  Nancy's no prize down there either.  My God, I saw her naked the other day.  Yeah?  What a horror.  It looked like President Taft eating a ribeye steak. 
[02:32:00]  Well, thank God.  Remember that big mustache?  Please know the reference.  We figured it out.  I was going to say Grant, but that was too obvious.  Very good.  Well, I guess.  Do you see the picture in the paper?  Yeah.  Nancy is kissing you on your 89th birthday this past February.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Look at the shape of her.  It was like kissing a piece of liver on a stick.  Jesus.  She's feeding you the birthday cake, too, there, I see.  Yeah, she is.  Yeah.  Very nice. 
[02:32:30]  When I hug her, it's more like hugging some of those Chili's baby back ribs.  My God.  What a mess.  All right.  Listen.  And I'm glad I have Alzheimer's.  Why?  Well, if I didn't, I might remember that at one time in my life,  my sack didn't look like two bocce balls in a sweat sock.  I can walk on water, and I'm an airplane. 
[02:33:00]  All right.  Wait.  Yeah, let's bring that up.  It says, and I quote,  We are afraid that Mr. Reagan might fall.  He walks around the garden and occasionally may try to stand in the pool.  Yes.  You're trying to walk on water, sir?  I'm Moses.  Let my people go.  I'll park the Red Sea.  Lead my people to Trenton.  Hello?  Yeah, we're here.  Where were they going?  I don't remember. 
[02:33:30]  To Bangkok.  Bangkok.  With that whore, Gerald Ford.  He tossed my salad, and I gave him a rusty trombone.  Well, oh, look.  Here comes the mothership for Mommy.  Finally taking her back to that home planet of bag of bones with big eyes.  You're sick, man.  Goddamn tip her head back, and a pez comes out.  Yes.  Well, Mr. Reagan, there's someone on line, too, that is very pissed off at us for talking to you, I guess. 
[02:34:00]  Yes.  Would you like to talk to her?  Of course.  It's not that Leonid Brezhnev, is it?  No, it's not.  I hated her, too.  Patricia.  Yeah.  Hello.  You're on with the former president of the United States of America.  Is this Patricia Nixon?  No, my name is not Patricia Nixon.  Okay.  I just wanted to say that I really feel bad for you, and I'm sorry that you have to put  up with such horrific, you know. 
[02:34:30]  Yes, Nancy, you're talking about.  I know.  And her big, bloated, Mardi Gras float head.  Have you seen my pain?  My mother has Alzheimer's.  Yes.  And I know the pain that you're suffering.  You do?  Yes.  I forget about it every day.  I'm sorry.  Oh, wait a minute.  That last liver spot just popped on my face.  I'm officially black.  Oh, my God.  You guys are really horrible. 
[02:35:00]  What are you talking about?  Who?  You're horrible.  Yes, you're talking about that Sam Donaldson.  President Reagan.  We're talking to him.  We are Alzheimer's, right?  I better be on my best behavior.  Hello, President Reagan.  Where is he?  Why isn't he answering?  I heard Trish Nixon say he's on the phone.  You guys.  What?  That's so mean.  Hey, do you have a nice ass?  Because Nancy looks like a big head of cauliflower. 
[02:35:30]  Only paler.  Hello?  Do you have a question for Mr. Reagan, Patricia?  Yes, I do.  No.  Mr. Reagan, tear down that wall.  I'm confused.  No, I don't have a question.  Okay.  Thank you, Patricia.  You are.  Goddamn f*** her.  Oh, my God.  Wait a minute.  Wait.  Wait.  Mr. Reagan, you can't curse.  Well, everything.  Oh, okay.  Wow.  What a twat. 
[02:36:00]  I learned some new words.  I'm listening to this show, the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah, you like it?  What a couple of ass wipes.  But, well, they're funny.  All right.  Yes.  Well, I guess we're going to let you go, Mr. Reagan, okay?  Okay.  Well, have fun, you know, on your wedding anniversary, 48 years this weekend.  Are you guys going to have an intimate night there?  Anal sex.  Anal sex.  That's what me and Nancy are doing.  Anal for Ronald.  Anal sex in the pool. 
[02:36:30]  Okay.  Call me again soon before, well, the year 2000 is over.  Okay.  Because I'll probably be dead.  All right.  There you go.  Thank you.  The former president of the United States.  Where?  Where?  You, Mr. Reagan.  Oh.  Yeah.  Oh, that's right.  I forget.  I'm surprised that Nancy hasn't discovered that you're talking on the phone today.  Well, I believe she's on Venus today.  Yeah, okay.  Yes.  All right, man.  Goodbye.  Bye.  There you go.  Mr. Reagan.  Where the hell did Anthony go? 
[02:37:00]  All right.  Anyway, we got to take a break.  Oh, God damn.  Ann.  Woo, almost missed him again.  Ann.  President Reagan, when you were commenting on the fall of communism, I want to know what  you were...  Yeah.  What?  What?  Hello?  He's not on the line anymore.  God damn.  You can't hold him until I'm in the...  You said you were going to take a leak.  That was 15 minutes ago.  You missed it again.  Well, maybe next time. 
[02:37:30]  That's all I can say.  Look, you have your little piece of paper with all the questions written down for him and  stuff.  I remember Ford, that transvestite from Bangkok, mailed in 1948.  What's he doing with Sam Donaldson's wig loop?  No, no.  Like it or not, this will be the most popular radio show in New York City.  The only show beats the hell out of my dad's old pornos. 
[02:38:00]  Why don't you set up?  I didn't mean that was here.  Well, we had this lady call up about 20 minutes ago, Anthony.  She said she wants to meet Psycho Mark, which is a laugh riot because this is the first time  that has ever happened on this radio show.  Because of Psycho Mark's behavior with the interns, dancers of privilege, and whatnot,  we've had to tape him to a chair, duct tape to a chair, so he doesn't get his...  Easy, don't say that.  They're going to dump out, I think.  So he doesn't get his hands all over these poor girls that come in here. 
[02:38:30]  She's what, 5'11", 140 pounds, blonde hair, and said...  Small breast, nice body, she was telling us.  She's in town for a photo shoot, and I asked if she was a model.  She said yes.  Rick says that she's got gorgeous long legs.  Model type, young?  Only 20.  All right, so the only way we would agree that one of our listeners, one of our listeners  would meet Psycho Mark as if he was tied to a chair, and you guys did a great job. 
[02:39:00]  He's duct taped to the chair at this moment.  He's duct taped.  Great job.  What?  Yeah, let's blindfold him, and then we'll bring the girl in.  Dick.  We just had her on the phone about 15, 20 minutes ago.  All right, then bring the blindfold on, Anthony.  Psycho Mark.  Psycho Mark.  Oh, my God, it looks like an execution.  It looks like you're going to execute him.  Yeah, get a picture of that.  Boss, I would like some of them taters and some calm breath.  We're taking pictures for the unofficial O&O website. 
[02:39:30]  Down to you.  You can hit his face on the mic.  You all right?  Shut up.  You idiot.  Make sure you put the sponge and wet it and put it on top of his head.  And don't put a dry sponge there.  Okay.  All right, don't go too close.  All right, the mic is right in front of you.  Psycho Mark.  Psycho comes out.  Be careful, boss.  No, they said they've seen the girl.  All right, let's bring the girl in.  Let's see.  We will speak with her name. 
[02:40:00]  What's her name?  Anna.  Anna.  Anna.  Anna, hello.  How are you?  Anna.  How you doing?  Wow, you're tall.  Very nice.  And you want to meet that clown who's like duct tape to the chair to your right, huh?  I look great, don't I?  Hi, how are you?  That's the sexiest laugh I've ever heard.  Really?  Really?  Did I lift up the microphone a little bit?  It's a psychopathic laugh is what it is.  Really psycho.  Let me see the ass.  I have a crush on him.  Go ahead.  All right.  Well, wait, wait, wait a minute. 
[02:40:30]  Wow.  Wow.  All right.  You wanted to see the ass.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Yeah.  All right.  We can say that for psycho Mark, right?  Yeah.  Look at psycho Mark.  This isn't right.  Why?  Look at you.  You look better than you molesting these girls.  I would never do that.  Well, why don't you go over to psycho Mark there.  Flirt with him a little bit.  Go over there.  Yeah.  There she is.  I hate him. 
[02:41:00]  Look at him.  He's like, he's all blindfolded.  Oh, great.  Let some junk land on my shoulder.  Why don't you take the blindfold off, Mark, and meet one of your fans.  She's taking the blindfold off.  Hi.  How are you?  How are you?  What's wrong?  I'm going to be telling you.  There's a big fan of yours right there.  Hi.  How are you?  Nice to meet you.  I've got the hearts for you.  Can I have my hat back, please?  I've been listening for years, and I do have a crush on you. 
[02:41:30]  Really?  Yes.  I think I have a really sexy ass.  Ah, oh, uh-huh.  Psycho Mark, what do you think of Anna?  Very, very nice.  Very nice.  Very, very nice.  Show me that.  You want to see my butt?  Yeah, I'll see some butt.  Oh, my God.  Showing Psycho Mark the ass.  All right.  How are you going?  You like that?  Yeah, yeah.  Sit down, Danny.  Sit down, Danny.  Yeah, I've been doing shoots all this week.  Shoots?  I did a shoot for trying to get a nugget magazine. 
[02:42:00]  Oh, really?  Yeah, trying to get the front cover of Nugget.  Nugget.  Nugget.  Yeah.  All right.  What is Nugget magazine?  It's one of those books that you find in the naughty store.  Oh.  Wow.  What do you think, Mark?  How about a little forcible lap dance there?  So you've been naked before.  I hustle, not drink.  Okay.  You've been naked before, right?  Yes, sir.  I want you to show Psycho Mark some stuff here.  You want to see some stuff, Psycho Mark? 
[02:42:30]  Some stuff?  Sure.  Show me the stuff.  A little dance.  Sure.  Well?  Let her rip.  Yeah, let her rip.  I'm the submissive type, so you tell me what to do and I'll do it.  Oh, my God.  Bark like a dog.  You're a rip.  This is great.  This is great.  Just tell her to do something, man.  All right.  We'll remove that jacket.  All right.  There you go.  I'm still in here.  I think I'm getting young. 
[02:43:00]  What do you think so far, Psycho Mark?  She's got a tattoo on her shoulder.  Hot bod.  On my back?  Very nice.  Do you think she has a hot bod?  Yeah.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  What else?  Let's see.  I want to see Psycho Mark work his pimp hand.  Yeah, right.  Pimp hand.  Even though he can't move.  If you're just tuning in Psycho Mark, duct taped,  to a chair to meet one of his admirers.  And so far, he thinks she's very hot.  Like the butt, like the rest of the body.  Mm-hmm.  Go ahead, Psycho Mark. 
[02:43:30]  All right.  Jump up on my chair and grind on my face.  Wow.  That's a little blunt.  Let's get going.  That's a little blunt.  Okay.  But one more thing.  What would you like me to grind on your face?  Uh-oh.  Let's start with the chest.  With the chest.  All right.  Okay.  My chest is all sweaty because it was really hot out in the car.  So that's just your little warning.  Since you're tied up there,  you can't get away.  Wow.  Wow.  She is mounted in Psycho Mark.  She does like Mark.  She is like rubbing her boobies in Psycho Mark's face.  She's grinding the boobs. 
[02:44:00]  Give him a little more of that.  He kind of enjoyed that one.  All right.  And thank God he's duct taped because he can't grab the ass.  She just stuck her naked boobs in Mark's face and now he's losing it.  Very nice.  Very nice.  Try the other cheek.  The other cheek.  Yeah.  I mean, that's just...  Oh.  I can't describe what's going on.  Well, she is pulling her shirt down and rubbing bare boob on Psycho Mark's cheek. 
[02:44:30]  She has taken her gum out, Psycho Mark, and...  One of his admirers, he's duct taped to a chair.  What else?  Okay.  What's next?  Oh, yes.  Let's work that nice vine.  Oh.  Oh.  Work the vine piece of vine.  Don't rub it on my face.  Oh, there you go.  Very, very good.  Yeah.  She is now sitting on Psycho Mark's package. 
[02:45:00]  There's no other way to say it.  I guess.  Jumping up and down.  Psycho Mark can't use the hands because they're duct taped to a chair.  Psycho Mark is getting, like, ass grinded on his junk.  I just got to be blunt about it.  Oh, my God.  Thank God he's taped down.  Thank God because his hands are all over.  It looks like another night of privilege.  Your hands are really purple.  This is like privilege.  I swear to God.  He's groping.  He's like, his arms are turning blue because he's trying to grab.  Look at him.  He's pushing himself in the chair.  He's torture. 
[02:45:30]  He's torture.  He's torture.  He's torture.  He's torture.  He's torture.  It's torture because he can't use his hands.  Are you pitching a tent?  No.  No.  No.  Maybe he needs, uh...  I am not pitching a tent in front of all you.  I'm not looking...  We can't.  Well, why don't you feel to see if he is.  She wants to...  No, I'm not pitching anything.  Feel to see if he is.  It's at least a tough time.  Oh, my God.  She was just checking in for us. 
[02:46:00]  Don't.  Don't take a picture of my junk.  Just grab this back in.  Anna, is there anything going on down there?  Can we play what's in your pants?  Anna.  Oh.  Anna, is there anything going on down there?  I'll tell you right now.  There's nothing going on there.  You must be a fag, then.  I'm a fag, then.  She's rubbing her body all over you.  What about...  Hmm.  Play what's in, uh...  What's in her pants?  I think that would be great.  You want to play? 
[02:46:30]  Yeah.  You want to play, right?  Um...  Well, just, uh...  Give me my personal rules here.  All right.  Okay.  See my hands?  I'm going to stick it up.  She's going to walk into it.  All right.  Wait, how about...  All right.  Wait, wait, wait.  All right.  What are you doing?  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  She looks like she's willing to do your rules.  Are you kidding?  Put the blindfold back on.  How did he look good?  Oh, my God.  Come on.  We'll play a new version of what's in my pants.  Damn it. 
[02:47:00]  She will put the blindfold on.  You reach your hand out.  You reach under.  Oh, my God.  And then what?  But he's got to be able to...  Oh, it's just going to be Psycho Mark playing?  Yeah, with his hand.  And then he has to tell us what it is.  You know, guess what it is.  Are you cool for that?  I'm fine with that.  I'm totally fine with that.  All right.  You ready?  All right.  Psycho Mark is blindfolded.  We're playing a live version of what's in my pants.  Psycho Mark's going to put his hand out.  And Anna's going to put her patch, I guess.  I guess we could say that. 
[02:47:30]  All right.  Put your fingers out or something.  Put your hand out, Psycho Mark.  There's junk there.  I don't know.  I've been changed.  All right.  All right.  You ready?  Put your hand.  Put your hand.  Wait a minute.  Wait.  I've got to see this.  Come on.  All right.  All right.  His hand is out, Anthony.  Yeah.  Anna has...  Casually walked out.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  She's giving Psycho Mark's fingers a little, uh, more attention. 
[02:48:00]  Let's just put it that way.  What do you think that was, Psycho Mark?  Sure.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Yeah.  She's, uh, she's working Psycho, uh, Psycho Mark's, uh, fingers.  Oh.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Why don't we play what's in my...  Yeah.  Play what's in, uh, what's in my pants.  Yeah.  My fingers are all lubed up.  All right.  Lipstick all over his hand.  All right.  All right.  She has just, uh, stepped over Psycho Mark's hand.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh. 
[02:48:30]  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Wearing a little body suit.  Hmm.  Oh.  What?  What?  What?  What?  What's wrong, baby?  What?  What is it?  What is it?  What is it?  Psycho Mark?  Triangle?  Wood floor?  Mohawk?  What?  What?  What? 
[02:49:00]  What's wrong?  What's wrong?  What's wrong?  Don't you want to play now, Mark?  What's the matter, Mark?  Mark?  Mark, what's up?  What is it?  I'm not going to play anymore.  What is it, Mark?  What for?  I'm not sure.  What do you guess?  No, I'm not going to guess.  Why don't you guess?  You mean you're done playing?  No!  Take a mark of the strap back, John!

That's cool.  I can't tell myself now.  Wow.  Damn, is that funny.  God, was that funny.  Did I not take the joke good?  I didn't look any bathroom doors off.  It was so funny.  We had him blindfolded, and his hand was reaching around, trying to find Anna's whatever name. 
[02:51:30]  What's your real name?  My name is Anna.  Anna.  Anna.  My name is trying to find my Kiki.  He didn't play no Kiki.  So now, are you going to get an operation?  Yeah, you are?  You're all gearing up for the operation?  Well, first I'm getting my boobs.  You're getting boobs first?  I have big jugs.  Right.  And then I'm going to go and get the rest of it done.  Wow.  You're taking hormones or anything?  Yes, I have been for like a year and a half.  A year and a half?  Yeah, because I can't really see any stubble or anything.

Oh, yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah, wow.  Well, you can plug your bondage videos.  Why don't you plug your little bondage videos? 
[02:52:30]  Let me go over to my face one more time.  Mark totally dug it, man.  The best part was when he was reaching around and all of a sudden found John and he was like...  What did you feel, Mark?  Nothing.  Did you feel a gambag or a sausage?  You felt it, you idiot.  We have proof.  We have proof.  What do you got, it tucked back there?  You got it all tucked under or something?  Perfectly.  Perfectly tucked under?  Ben's the expert in this department.  So you were feeling sausage?

[02:55:30]  We have a present for him.  Oh, I'll be a birthday present.  That's okay.  You can give it to Mark.  Huh?  It's a lady.  Is it from Shannon, the hot piece of ass, or the training?  You know when that's for, Opie?  Oh, paddling.  You know when that's for?  That's for your girlfriend.  Do you know a lesson in that?  Oh, monkey.  What did you say?  They don't get busted anymore.  I heard that when you were downstairs watching the races.  Whacking it?  Yeah.  Oh, I don't know.  A little picture for our office, too.  And last but not least, for those long nights in the bathroom, we have this tape you can put in to give you a little inspiration. 
[02:56:00]  Oh, yeah?  What's the tape of?  It's really good.  What is the tape of?  You must play it.  It is wonderful.  All right, we'll get some tape of that and put it on the air.  Well, Psycho Mark, we got you.  I think we have a love connection.  Oh, jeez.  Oh, that voice is great.  Where's the picture of Anna?  Someone...  I put a Mark's office for him.  Where is that?  Everyone's checking out Anna's junk, because it's on our website. 
[02:56:30]  What's the website again, Anna?  www.hotshannon.com, and then you link on the Opie and Anthony banner.  And you get to see what Psycho Mark had in his hand.  They're texting me and my email address.  All right.  Can we hear your real voice one more time before we go to break?  Well, what would you like me to say?  Say Psycho Mark, I love you.  Psycho Mark, I love you.  Whoa.  Oh, my God.  Where's the warning? 
[02:57:00]  He looks like a Gimp.  He looks like the Gimp trying to get out of the studio Psycho Mark.  Look at him.  So those are your pictures right there?  Yes.  They're the ones that we're trying to get on Nuggets.  Actually, the ones that we have for...  that we're sending in are better.  They're just webcam shots.  Yeah?  We have the crumbs.  I see you're covering up your junk over there.  Yeah.  Cleverly have your hand there, poised, during that shot.  Yeah, that's it.  Covering the junk.  And, uh...  Yeah.  And there's your email. 
[02:57:30]  Sure.  Anna the Transsexual.  Rob from JFK.  Make sure Ball Boy...  Sorry, Psycho Mark washes off the man-meat junk from his hands before touching anything in the studio.  You don't even need to take me to the prom.  I'm a cheap date.  Butt sex.  Penises.  Oh, great. 
[02:58:00]  Puss-a!  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  No, no.  So when are you having your operation?  Anna, when are you having your operation?  Um, well, uh, depends on how many sugar daddies I find before then.  Wait, you need someone to sponsor it?  No, I'm just kidding.  No, uh, I'm saving my money now.  I mean, I'm not as pressed about it because...  How much does that run?  Well, if you go to Thailand, I bet it'll be about, like, $7,000.  Thailand?  If I do it in the U.S., it'll be $14,000.  Well, you get what you pay for.  What do you want to go with?  They do it with chopsticks over there, don't they? 
[02:58:30]  You kind of pull it away like a piece of rice.  You know what?  Slice and dice?  I don't know.  I'd be a little leery.  Well, I'd be a little leery about having it, uh, even thinking about it, having that done.  My God.  Hey, Matt, what's going on?  You must hate your penis, don't you?  Yeah, guys.  What's up?  Wow.  Hey, Matt.  Hates your penis.  What's up?  No, what's up?  Hey, guys.  All I got to say is, man, I haven't been listening to you that long.  A couple of my friends turned me on to you guys.  I'll tell you right now.  That was the best joke I have heard you guys pull the entire time I have been listening 
[02:59:00]  to you.  And Psycho Mark, a very good sport about it.  Almost too good a sport.  Almost too good.  I'll tell you what.  I'll tell you what.  I'll tell you what.  It's an indication when Psycho Mark gets the taste out of his mouth.  I should have heard me whispered in my ear.  In your ear?  Yeah.  What did he say?  I'm not telling.  I'm not telling you what I'm saying.  Oh.  Are you whispering in her ear?  He did.  He did.  That's another show.  Psycho Mark has this habit of dry-humping girls. 
[02:59:30]  Yeah.  That walk around.  Could you just dry-hump them one last time before we take a break?  No!  Yeah.  You look like the gimp.  Hold them in play.  Go ahead.  Hold them in play.  Hold them in play.  You look like the gimp.  This is how the poor ladies feel around the office when you're dry-humping them.  Oh.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  Georgia!  This is Georgia! 
[03:00:00]  I'm jealous.  You could give me some competition on those nipples there.  Fuck!  What?  Yeah, it sucked them!  Yeah!  I didn't suck my nipples!  No!  Get them!  Get them!  Get them!  Get them!  Gotham!  That's where?  That's gorgeous! 
[03:00:30]  Come here, man.  Look out.  You're lost.  Come here.  Come here.  Oh, my God.  Well, that's pretty funny.  You ever seen a grown man naked?  I think he has a case of cabin fever.  You think? 
[03:01:00]  It drops the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again.  God, that was him.  It drops the lotion on its skin.  It does this whenever it's told.  Can you see every painful detail of my muscular physique?  Butt dick.  Butt dick. 
[03:01:30]  You use your tongue prettier than a $20 horse.  Ouch.  All right.  Excuse me while I whip this out.  Okay, brother.  Woo!  Very good.  I'm thinking of my mouth.  Yeah, that's what I think. 
[03:02:00]  All right.  Very good, Mark.  Good job.  Get him out, Mark.  Psycho, Mark.  What a sport.  Yippee.  You'll never forget me for that one.  It was good fun.  You know, I can actually take a joke unlike other people on the show.  That's right, Chuck Boy.  At least I didn't rip the bathroom door up the wall and smash things.  You didn't recognize, Anna, without the makeup and the nice hair and everything.  It's our own Mark Parenteau. 
[03:02:30]  The old jock from 2104, remember?  It's the rare admiral.  All right.  We got to take a break.  Hey, hey.  Hey, hey.  Put your hand up, my scared Mark.  Hey.  You're a junkie.  You're just happy to see me.  All right.  Oh, boy.  Well, we got to thank Anna for coming in.  Anna, thank you very much.  A lot of people checking in on the website saying they went and saw your picture on the  website and said they wouldn't have been able to figure it out either.  Right on.  Well, wait.  We need her to tape a couple things. 
[03:03:00]  If we hit record, will it work?  All right.  Just hit record.  Or just get on that.  All right.  Anna, repeat after me.  In both voices.  All right.  Look what I did to you again.  Look what I did to you again.  And now as a guy, look what I did to you again.  Yeah. 
[03:03:30]  All right.  We'll be back.  Hey, let me do that one again.  All right.  Go ahead.  Look what I did to you again.  Oh, my God.  Just a deeper voice than me.  I can sing like a girl and a guy, actually.  Type on negative.  Yeah, I can do it.  Type on negative, really?  I can do a Peter Steele impression.  Really?  Let's do that.  Can you do that?  I've been looking for trouble.  And boy, I found her.  Wow.  Hey, that junk is just in your face, Michael Mark.  Wow.  All right. 
[03:04:00]  All right.  Listen, we've got to take a break.  212-757-1027.  We'll be back in just a bit.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, God.  You bastard.  1027-WNEW.  1027-WNEW. </pre>
