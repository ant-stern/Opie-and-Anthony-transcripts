<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide array of topics, beginning with a discussion of the hosts' sleeping habits and preferences,  leading to humorous anecdotes about home invasions and the absurdity of encountering a naked intruder.  This segued into a conversation about their relationships, morning sex, and the challenges of morning breath and body odor. One host recounted a bizarre dream featuring the other two, which they jokingly analyzed.

A major segment focused on the cancellation of Sir Ben Kingsley's scheduled appearance, with the hosts expressing anger and frustration at Kingsley's publicist, Roland, for the last-minute cancellation and the unsatisfactory explanation given.  They announced a listener boycott of Kingsley's new film and emphasized their growing influence and power over their audience.  This cancellation was revisited later in the show.

Comedian Jimmy "the Greek" joined the show, recounting a fancy dinner with Chris Rock, Louis C.K., and Matthew Broderick, and a surprising encounter with Alan Alda, who revealed he'd Googled the show and was impressed.  The segment also included discussion of videos from Break.com, ranging from humorous to graphic content, including a British news reporter's terrified reaction to a roller coaster. Patrice O’Neal’s upcoming radio show was promoted.

A substantial portion of the show was dedicated to analyzing New York local news traffic reporter Jill Nicolini's attire and perceived attractiveness. The hosts also commented on the body language of another news anchor, Linda Church, and compared Nicolini to other female news personalities, including Sonny Abada and a French reporter whose topless photos were discussed.  Their commentary included frequent and explicit opinions on the attractiveness and "attainability" of various news personalities.  The discussion expanded to include CNN's Jack Cafferty, specifically an incident where he berated his teleprompter operator, and a broader discussion about the overwhelming amount of news and the difficulties faced by news anchors.  The hosts also shared a humorous anecdote about Jerry Seinfeld and Colin Quinn's tipping habits and discussed Jack Cafferty's insensitive comment on Anna Nicole Smith's death.  Bill Burr joined the show in studio during this segment.  A significant portion focused on Burr's experience shooting a failed sitcom pilot, "Playing Chicken," including a disastrous table read.  They also discussed Tiger Woods' new baby, news anchors, and the "fakeness" of professional wrestling, including a fabricated story about Vince McMahon's death.  Listener calls were interspersed throughout.

Another substantial segment focused heavily on WWE's staged limousine explosion storyline involving Vince McMahon on *Monday Night Raw*. The hosts played audio of Stephanie McMahon's on-air emotional tribute, analyzing her performance and speculating on the storyline's implications, including the WWE's stock price and the possibility of a later reveal that McMahon was still alive.  They discussed the reactions of various celebrities and speculated on the ensuing investigation.  A call with Sam's girlfriend, Jess, provided humorous details about Sam's incredibly limited and childish diet. This segment also included Bill Burr in studio and further discussion of the Ben Kingsley cancellation, including a profane rant about the situation.  The hosts also briefly discussed a female news anchor's perceived promiscuity based on her attire and mentioned other online content.

The show included a segment centered on childhood experiences with parents and discipline, transitioning to anecdotes about drug use and family relationships. Anthony shared details about his childhood physical punishments, contrasting them with modern parenting methods.  He recounted stories of stealing his father's quarters and receiving a slap, and detailed physical punishments he received, including spankings and a figure four leg lock. He discussed his relationship with his father, describing it as distant but functional, marked by both physical discipline and shared activities. He also shared his first experience with marijuana and discussed his uncle's marijuana cultivation. Listener calls added further anecdotes about parenting styles and personal experiences, including a humorous incident with a father and a story about an older woman using her breasts as a disciplinary tool. Technical difficulties during the broadcast were also mentioned.

A final segment heavily featured vulgar terms for the vagina, with contributions from the hosts and callers. The conversation shifted to listeners' anecdotes about unusual sexual preferences and practices, including a woman who enjoyed being punched in the breasts and another who liked being choked.  Jimmy Norton recounted personal experiences involving slapping and choking during sex, leading to a brief, implied demonstration with a co-host.  The discussion included listener calls, with one suggesting a new term for the vagina and another sharing a story about oral sex resulting in ejaculate exiting the partner's sinuses.  The hosts promoted upcoming shows and discussed a Break.com video showing a groin kick prank. The "line of the day" was announced, and further promotions, including Bill Burr's comedy show appearance, were made.

Did we all have Jamie's on?  I don't remember, but it wasn't.  Oh, no, I was shirtless.  Great.  We each take a turn with a snore.  We go,  Moo!  Cheep, cheep, cheep, cheep, cheep, cheep, cheep.  Moo! 
[00:09:00]  Cheep, cheep, cheep, cheep, cheep.  Yeah.  But those stocking caps again.  But it wasn't like a homoerotic thing.  There's something about us all being in a situation together.  Well, that's probably what it is.  We're all, you know, we're all in this thing.  And if you feel like you're in some kind of trouble or danger, we're probably involved in that some way.  Yeah.  Probably causing it.  No, I don't remember what it was.  I just wish I could.  Because I dream of my girlfriend, I thought that I dreamt that she was coming to hurt me with other people.  I kept waking up and, like, I dreamt that she was there hurting me for real time.  Did you wake up and just punch her in the head? 
[00:09:30]  No, she was gone.  We'd been fighting.  And I just kept dreaming that she was hurting me.  Oh, no.  Oh, boy, Jamie.  You were teasing something in the office, by the way.  Are you ready for that or you want to do it a little later?  You do duke it out a lot.  We haven't much lately, though.  And all I see when you're together is nothing but happiness, smiles, and love.  Like, at the virus show.  It's a facade.  Whenever they're around, it's like, it's fun and everything.  And then...  You might want to walk.  Just hear what goes on in this apartment of Jimmy's.  You might want to walk around back. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah.  It's just a facade.  Oh, yeah.  As we roll around back, you'll notice the front is a facade.  This means false front.  That's right.  In the back, you'll just see two-by-fours holding it up, barely.  It was...  No, we haven't fought much lately.  That one, we fought like, you know, once or twice in the last three weeks.  I mean, not even less months.  I mean, it's not much at all lately.  Yeah.  But, yeah, that was a bad one.  I just remember she was coming to hurt me.  All right.  Well, the thing you were teasing, whatever it is, we'll do next break.  Oh, yeah.  It's a...  It's a doozy.  I always say it's a doozy, but it was just my... 
[00:10:30]  A lulu.  A lulu.  Hey, what evening?  Not typical.  Your evening.  Not typical.  I like that.  What website do you guys use to, like, diagnose yourself?  I'm a big fan of...  I use a real doctor.  Yeah, but...  Who needs doctors if you got the internet, though?  What's the good one?  Oh, my God.  People with this self-diagnosis crap are going to be killing themselves.  All right.  WebMD.com.  WebMD is the big one, I guess, that a lot of people use.  You might hear that my voice is shot.  This started on Friday.  Yesterday, I thought my voice was shot from the ONA trial and virus comedy show. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah, I had some grapple going.  But then I'm sitting there going, well, and I did kind of the light lifting.  We didn't really talk that much on stage, so I'm like, why is my, you know, throat kind  of sore?  Laughing Friday, probably.  Right.  And then, um, all night long, uh, uh, put in gulpy throat.  Gulpy throat?  Hard to swallow without, uh, severe pain in my throat.  Uh, yes.  Dr. Nagel?  Yeah.  This is what you do.  Ooh, gulp throat.  Wow. 
[00:11:30]  All right.  Gulp throat.  Dr. Nagel.  Dr. Nagel.  Paging Dr. Nagel.  All right.  And, um, and it feels like my throat is actually closing in on itself.  Like, there's not as much room in there, room in there for my tongue and stuff.  Because it's swollen?  It's a, it's a bad sore throat.  Is it swelling shut?  Right.  Bad sore throat.  Severe.  I would say severe.  Severe?  Yeah, I would say severe sore throat.  You might start getting diagnoses, though, for like, uh, bad things, like meningitis and  stuff.  I understand that.  That's the beauty of it.  I was going to say ass. 
[00:12:00]  I was going to say, I got, I am like really potty mouth.  Yeah, that's what I think I got right there.  Yeah, I think.  What?  I got, I think I got.  Half head?  I was looking at the picture.  They're only showing half my head.  You have half head.  I got half head?  No, I got.  What the hell is that?  Yeah, I would bet money I got the strep throat.  Yeah.  Strep.  You're always getting strep throat?  No, the last few times were just sore throats, but this one is definitely different.  You know, it helps.  Huh?  It's, you know, it's not pleasant.  What?  But, uh, there is something that people produce that would help your throat. 
[00:12:30]  I mean, you're not going to want to hear it.  Jimmy.  Dr. Jimmy.  Yeah, great.  Mix up a prescription for you.  My girlfriend never has a sore throat and her face never hurts.  Got it?  Yeah.  ¶¶ 
[00:13:00]  It's Rock Scream Tuesday.  Rock Scream!  Wow, you remember.  Rock Scream Tuesday.  You got to remember it's Rock Scream Tuesday.  Cody in Indiana, what's up? 
[00:13:30]  Hey, morning, fellas.  Good morning, Cody.  All right, I'm going to get this morning started.  If it's a little distorted, I'm a loud gentleman.  I'm sorry.  All right, let's go.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Wow.  Your phone couldn't keep up with that volume of yours.  I could do higher, I think. 
[00:14:00]  That was good.  That'll do.  Thank you, Cody.  Thank you.  Have a good day.  All right.  See you soon, Mike.  Bye, bye, bye, bye.  By the way, I think we might start our first boycott.  It's a new era for the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Error?  Era.  Oh, okay.  We just had an error.  I couldn't make the proper E.  Yeah.  I'm telling you, my throat's closing in on itself.  It's a new era for the O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[00:14:30]  We have started pretty much our own special interest group.  Yeah.  Because that's what happens out there to radio shows.  You get special interest groups, they get you thrown off the air.  So us being pretty smart, broadcasters thought, hmm, why don't we fight fire with fire and  start our own special interest group so we can show the power of a radio show.  Yep.  The power of a radio show and make sure we stay on the air.  Where the listeners are empowered, they don't have to become these people without a voice 
[00:15:00]  that when something happens to their radio show, they don't have a say in the matter  anymore.  Now, we've built up a huge interest group for the show and we can use it for other things  now.  Yeah.  I'm having a tough time talking right now.  My voice really hurts.  Basically, when a radio show gets in trouble, you get the special interest groups that get  them kicked off the air.  And most of the people from these special interest groups don't even know the show.  That's true.  So we have decided, well, there are people that actually enjoy these shows and they have 
[00:15:30]  to make sure their voice is heard.  Because they're never organized into a group that will be vocal or something.  Right.  Right, right.  They're in numbers.  They will never be vocal.  I'm sure a radio show that's been booted or something has gotten like one or two or  five emails, things like that.  They need that massive organization like the Opie and Anthony show is built.  But I also want to use this power for other things.  Opie, with power comes great responsibility.  Yeah, I understand that.  Now, we have to consult. 
[00:16:00]  I want the troops to be standing by.  But I think we might want to boycott Ben Kingsley's latest movie.  Oh!  Absolutely.  Do you think any of our listeners were going to see it anyway?  It looks like a movie that our listeners would probably be interested in.  Yeah?  Yeah, absolutely.  A guy that, what, stopped drinking, he's in rehab, and he kills people.  I actually want...  Oh, yeah, the Hitman.  That kind of sounds cool, yeah.  I actually wanted to see that. 
[00:16:30]  Yeah.  All right, well, I guess there goes that.  Well, we've been very excited to have Ben Kingsley on today's show.  Is that the one based on the video game?  Well, I don't know.  What video game?  Hitman.  No?  No.  I know Ben Kingsley's bald, and so is Hitman.  Okay.  Well, we've been looking forward to Ben Kingsley on our radio show for, what, a week or two  now?  More than two weeks.  And Ant and I went into the production room after the show yesterday, and we were doing  our promo that basically said, on the next Opie and Anthony show, Rock Scream Tuesday, 
[00:17:00]  we'll see if Steve's eyebrows grew in, and we also will talk to Sir Ben Kingsley.  Sir Ben Kingsley.  And as we were saying, Sir Ben Kingsley, Steve comes barging in, or he was scribbling  a note.  Actually, he was in studio already, and he scribbles a note.  He goes, change of plans, Ben Kingsley just canceled.  I'm like, what do you mean just canceled?  We're a mere hours away from talking to him on the show.  No, here's what they said, too.  Here's what was scribbled on the pad.  Ben Kingsley has rescheduled. 
[00:17:30]  So then I read Steve's email.  There's nothing about rescheduling.  It's a complete cancellation.  Yeah, and I guess he's scared to come on our show.  We can't believe, you can't put on him yet, though, because publicist...  Well, that's why I want the truth standing by.  I want an explanation why Ben Kingsley, Sir Ben Kingsley, is not going to be on our show  today.  We do a great job with big movie stars on this show.  I mean, we could list a ton of people that came in, and by the time they left the show,  they're like, wow, that was so much fun.  That was the best interview we did, blah, blah, blah. 
[00:18:00]  They know a lot of people they want to reach, listen to our show.  So what was the problem?  What was the real problem?  Did he Google our names, and he didn't like what he saw?  That's what I do.  Google our names and hate what I see.  Like, what happened?  One of a couple of things.  Either that, either what you just said, he goes, well, I can't.  I'm a sir.  Right.  A publicist is overprotecting him, or what they're saying, and this is the outside chance,  is legitimate, and he really does have a scheduling thing, which occasionally will happen. 
[00:18:30]  I don't necessarily buy that.  I don't need that.  I would like to find out what it is.  With such short notice like that.  Yeah, here's the deal, though.  We're sick of being pushed around, because these publicists F me all the time.  They're like, you know, we'll give you this A-lister if you take our C, D, and E-listers,  and you have to take the C, D, and E-listers for months on end for projects no one gives  a crap about, and then finally it's time for them to pay off with the A-lister, and  oh, he's sick, he's stuck in Europe, he's this, he's that.  Yep. 
[00:19:00]  We're sick of it.  You're right.  It's happened many times.  Did Danny DeVito come in like he was supposed to?  No.  Danny DeVito was supposed to come in.  We have a whole list of people that we were promised, and with Sir Ben Kingsley, if  he didn't want to do our show, then, you know, they should have figured that out  a while ago, not just mere hours before we're actually going to, you know, talk to the guy.  So we just want our troops massing on the border.  Yes.  That's it.  Having some exercises on the border as a show of force.  Absolutely.  Well, this is the promo we did yesterday.  We're trying to get the outtakes, because they were hilarious.  Oh.  92.3. 
[00:19:30]  K-Rock.  On the next Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah.  Sir Ben Kingsley, who just rescheduled.  What?  That's what I just got to note.  Ben Kingsley found out who Opie and Anthony are.  Yeah.  So here's the updated promo.  On the next Opie and Anthony show, we discuss why Sir Ben Kingsley is an at-  Rockies right here on 92.3 K-Rock.  That's for a New York station. 
[00:20:00]  Yeah.  I was about to say that, but yeah.  I mean, we found out as we were cutting the promo.  Are you kidding me?  We're trying to get to the bottom of that today.  We got lots to do, so.  Yep.  But we're sick of it.  I completely agree.  And we do have power with this radio show, and we're going to start using the power.  The power.  You know, we can't be pushed around anymore.  We should find out exactly what happened.  And we'll find out.  Hey, we'll give him the benefit of the doubt.  No problem.  But it was supposed to be rescheduling and this and that.  And like Ann said, if you read the email, it's just a complete cancellation. 
[00:20:30]  It's not a reschedule.  So then we, you know what?  If that's the case, if he doesn't like what we do and he can't be part of this radio show,  then guess what?  We're going to ask our listeners not to see his little movie.  Yeah.  That'll show him.  Probably will.  Yeah.  That's why they come on shows is to promote.  So if you promote against something, that, right, that does a job as well.  So we've got to get to the bottom of this immediately. 
[00:21:00]  Immediately.  All right.  We're just getting started.  Jimmy, what was it?  A fantasy?  You were teasing something.  Something about his evening.  This is time for the tease.  Oh, just, it was just, you didn't even tell us yet, but you said it's a good one.  Just a little something about my evening list.  I'm just a fancy gentleman.  All right.  We'll talk to Jimmy next.  I'm going to love this.  Fancy Jimmy.  Fancy Jimmy.  By the way, you know, it's getting great reviews, this movie.  Is it?  So what?  He doesn't need us, and he's decided he doesn't need us, and that's why.  Just bootleg it.  Yeah. 
[00:21:30]  Yeah, we'll be selling copies on the sidewalk today.  No, we'll just hand them out.  We don't need the money.  That's all.  We need a better tease.  Man, no one's going to stick around.  They'll all stick around to hear the tales of a fancy man.  Fancy Jim.  Oh, my God.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hear what everyone else is talking about.

[00:23:00]  Ah, good morning.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  It certainly is.  So what's the latest on Sir Ben Kingsley?  Apparently he was...  What were we told yesterday?  Here's the excuse we were told.  He had to film something in Canada, and he couldn't make our show.  So he would try to see if he can call from the set. 
[00:23:30]  This is all from the publicist.  And that's BS.  And first of all, we don't want a phoner.  And this is what publicists do all the time.  They come up with the lamest excuses.  We don't want a phoner.  We wanted Sir Ben Kingsley in studio with us.  Are we going to get photos with the phone?  Yeah.  Are we going to get our pictures?  Yeah, the reality is...  And that's the most important part of an interview.  Yeah, we talked to some of these people just so Jimmy could get a photo.  Of course.  Let's be honest with each other here.  And Kingsley?  That's a good one, though.  I enjoy a good photo, an Oscar winner.  Of course, it's been 25, 30 years since, but he was an Oscar winner. 
[00:24:00]  Whatever.  So, all right, that's what they told us.  But now we're hearing that he was on Conan last night.  He was on Conan last night.  Now, Jimmy did bring up Conan does tape at 5, so it is possible to do that and then fly out  and get to Canada and do his stuff there.  Yeah.  It's a possibility.  He may be shooting in Montreal or Toronto or something like that.  We don't know.  Well, we'll have to wait and see.  I say he pops on TV. 
[00:24:30]  Now, that's the ticket here.  If he pops up on one of these New York morning shows, if he pops up on Regis, something like  that, then we know he's still in New York, could have done this program, chose not to,  and then release the hands.  Oh, yeah.  We basically want you to boycott his new movie.  Open the cage!  Because we've been lied to.  Oh, and then the publicist would call up and go, you know who I represent, blah, blah, 
[00:25:00]  blah, blah, blah, blah, and if you do this, don't expect any of my people on your show.  Clam up!  That's what I'll say.  Yeah.  Through somebody.  Exactly.  Mm-hmm.  That would be translated into some diplomatic speech.  Yes.  From Roland.  I think it's okay.  I just think.  I think.  Think.  Serpent Kingsley.  Slithered away.  Serpent.  Kingsley.  All right, Jimmy, why are you a fancy man?  We'll keep on that, Sir Ben Kingsley. 
[00:25:30]  I want to hear about Jim's fanciness last night.  I forgot.  It's funny.  You know how Louis C.K.  our pal, I found out, and I was disgusted, by the way, that he had done a film with Alan  Alda.  Alan Alda.  Yes.  Of MASH fame, amongst many other post-MASH things.  I'm a huge fan of.  Wait, can you get Alan Alda's IMDb up?  I'm sick of people that always state the obvious.  Alan Alda.  He was on West Wing.  I mean, he was on Seems Like Old Times. 
[00:26:00]  Yes.  You know, The Four Seasons.  The guy did many movies right after MASH, too.  Yeah.  He was in a lot of films, man.  Don't forget, he also did Everyone Says I Love You.  I am.  That's going to be my new bit.  Go with the obscure ones.  That's obscure.  I don't think he's in a movie.  Ooh.  And don't forget Whispers in the Dark from 1992.  I want a TV movie.  Oh, yeah.  He was in The Aviator. 
[00:26:30]  Yeah, he was in The Aviator.  With DiCaprio.  He's brilliant.  All right.  So you got to meet him last night, Jimmy?  Well, I had met him once before.  I got a picture with him.  I stalked him in his book signing.  But I've been dying to get the picture signed, but Alan is notoriously difficult to get a  picture with.  So Louie invites me to the cast party, and I'm in the cab, and I have my picture and  my little pens, and Louie calls.  He goes, don't come.  And I'm like, why, Lou?  Oh.  And he goes, Alan is not going to show up.  It's in a hip-hop club.  They're having the cast party in the back room of a hip-hop club where you have to be 
[00:27:00]  wanded to walk through.  So I'm so pissed off.  Oh, no.  I'm standing there with this stupid Alan Alda photo.  He and I smiling.  You know, just a fat boy and an icon.  And I have my little pens, two different colors, Sharpies.  Oh.  In case Alan has a preference.  Oh, this is so typical.  I cancel my spot, and I'm like, ah.  And he goes, but instead, he goes, you want to go to Noble and have dinner with me and  Chris Rock?  What?  Wow.  And I'm like, you know what?  I think I would like that.  Wow.  So I head to Noble, which I've never been to, and I have a fancy dinner. 
[00:27:30]  The close one or the far one from here?  The downtown one.  Okay.  The Ridge.  All right.  And I walk in.  It was funny.  It was Chris Rock, and then it was Louie and then me.  You've never seen Order of Importance so perfectly displayed.  And so we're sitting there eating, and I was actually going to leave my picture.  I was like, I'll leave it in the cab, because I was embarrassed, because I had it in an envelope  with my markers and a piece of cardboard, and I had it in a shopping baggie just to carry 
[00:28:00]  it properly.  Well, Chris Rock might have thought you had a script with you, so that could have been  kind of...  I wouldn't have.  If he saw one episode of Lucky Louie, he'd know I didn't have a script unless I wrote  it.  You know, nobody sent me one.  So I had a fancy fine dinner at Noble.  And then Matt came, and we sat down, and it was cool to have like four of us there.  Who paid?  Chris did.  What a guy.  Yeah.  Did you see how much he tipped?  I didn't notice.  Did he break the myth?  No.  I'm sure he did.  It was a very expensive dinner.  But we had to stay along, because Matt, it was late, and he just ate a little bit later, 
[00:28:30]  and no one knew he was coming.  He just kind of showed up.  So what did you guys talk about?  Well, when Chris, me, and Louie talked about the business, and then Matthew, we talked about  like...  Matthew.  Roderick, yeah.  Oh, okay.  That's what I was waiting for.  Yeah, you know, he came and sat down.  Matthew Broderick.  Yeah, yeah.  Then came and sat down with you.  Yeah, we discussed tough crowd.  He was a fan, and we all just chit-chatted a little bit.  Were you brave enough to talk about the Opie and Anthony show?  Were you brave enough to talk about how he...  You sell out.  How we railed his wife?  Well, I'll tell you one thing.  You sell out. 
[00:29:00]  She gave us a knockout punch.  Jimmy has enough credits now where he doesn't have to use the Opie and Anthony.  You know?  So it's like, yeah, I was on Lucky Louie.  HBO specials that I do.  And I just filmed my HBO special.  Well, me, Louie, and Chris did talk about the show, because we talked about the Jones  Beach thing, because he's like, aren't Opie and Anthony doing something like big?  Did he hurt?  Oh, yes, yes.  So we talked about the...  He knows about the stand-up stuff.  That's pretty cool.  And then I'm sure Matthew...  Broderick.  He had a... 
[00:29:30]  Broderick.  Matthew Broderick.  He had a very twisted sense of humor.  Did he?  Yeah.  So I don't think it would have freaked him out at all, especially because you guys...  It was funny the way she called up, and you guys did what I would have done, which is  like...  You know?  I mean, who wouldn't appreciate that?  Of course.  So it was good.  So we all had a nice, fancy dinner, like gentlemen, and then we all left, and Matthew  and I took a picture.  And I went to the cast party anyway, because I felt like being part of it.  You did?  At the hip-hop club?  Yes.  And Alan Alda was there.  No.  And so Alan and I chit-chatted for a little bit.  No, now you're lying.  Oh, no, I'm not.  He was there, and I walk over, and Louie is the... 
[00:30:00]  There's no one I love more than Louie C.K.  He introduces me to Alan, and I have my little shopping...  I'm thankful.  If I would have left it in the cab, I would have slipped my throat in front of Alan and  yelled, Hawkeye quote.  But we're sitting there talking for a little bit, and it turns out, I think Louie told  you this, but Alda had Googled Louie and listened to some of this program.  Yeah, we were kind of saying that yesterday.  Wow.  And he had listened to some of this show, and he's like, yeah, Alan, this is a  Jim, who's a comedian.  He's on that Opie and Anthony show.  He's like, oh, those guys.  He's like, those guys, they were much more insightful and thoughtful than I would have 
[00:30:30]  thought.  Well, book Alan Alda.  Well, I wouldn't go nuts.  Slow down.  We were talking, and I said, I'm sure there's certain bits that would sway your opinion.  You know, in case he Googled more.  Yeah, thanks for calling us under the bus.  Oh, no, I had to.  Stay away from that Google.  Jimmy was separating as much as possible.  No, I had to prepare him in case he Googled again.  I'm right.  That clever stuff must have been when I was on the show, you know.  Someone tell Alan Alda, Google causes cancer.  Don't go there. 
[00:31:00]  We had a lovely chat about MASH, and he was so happy that I knew this moment.  We were talking about language.  And he knows that we've caught flack, and he's like, you know.  And I'm like, well, even you guys.  I mean, you said son of a bitch on the air before anyone else had said that.  That was a big issue back then.  And he goes, I wrote that.  He was so psyched.  Oh, did he do it in that way, that Alan Alda?  I wrote that.  Yes, he could have just seen it.  Wow, and his hand went in a minute.  Oh.  Wait a minute.  You can't write son of a bitch.  Well, no, he wrote the scene, though, with Mako.  Yeah, I understand, but that's what he said. 
[00:31:30]  You can't really get credit for writing son of a bitch into a sitcom.  But I wrote that.  Son of a bitch is just one of those things we all have written.  Did you feel like Trapper John when he did that?  I did, but not in 1982, because that was never done.  Right.  And I'm like, that was an amazing moment.  And he goes, we had so much problems.  They tried to, like, the network tried to censor us.  We had this talk about censorship.  And then I think I got, like, a little too intense.  And I was like, how about that episode where, you know.  Oh, you went too far.  Enough about MASH.  Yeah.  Jimmy was the went too far guy.  Oh, talk about MASH.  Like, one instance like that is great. 
[00:32:00]  But then if you keep talking about MASH, because it's all anyone probably talks to him about  when they first meet him.  So we had, like, a good five-minute chat about stuff.  And then it was great.  And someone started talking to him.  And I'm like, all right, man.  I put my hand out.  And it just said that.  No!  No!  Oh, you had to walk away with your hand?  Dude, the director saw it.  He's the guy that played, like, McManus on Oz.  He saw it.  Like, people around saw it.  And then Alan saw my hand.  And he goes, oh.  And he shook my hand.  Oh.  Nicely.  But I hadn't gotten my picture signed. 
[00:32:30]  I was too embarrassed to ask.  We were chatting.  And then Louie's the greatest.  He's like, do you want me to ask?  I'm like, no, I'll do it.  And then we were discussing this.  And then Matthew Broderick is like, well, do you want me to ask for you?  I have Matthew Broderick involved.  Matthew Broderick is going to whore out for your picture.  He's getting my stupid photo signed.  Because Alan hates signing crap because of all these idiots that wanted MASH stuff signed.  They sell it.  Yeah.  And Louie was very gracious and asked him.  And Alan said, well, I always make exceptions for cops and firemen.  And comedians.  So he signed a very nice photo for me. 
[00:33:00]  And that was my evening.  He signed it.  Dear Jim, I'm your biggest fan.  Alan Alda.  Wow.  Yeah, it was just to be sweet.  He was very sweet.  He was really nice.  What a fancy evening you had.  I had the hobnobbing with stars.  I had the evening of a gentleman.  Wow.  You were doing that.  I was kidding.  Okay.  Okay.  So then I went home and grabbed what could be mistaken as a twisted turnip root and just  couldn't let the party go.  So I was online watching pornography.  Not even horny.  Just one more thing to help me escape from who I really am. 
[00:33:30]  Picture or not.  Do you think Alan did the same thing?  Went home and just put pornography up on his computer?  No, he probably went home and just looked at his 11 seasons of DVDs.  I invited Broderick on the show, by the way.  I told him he'd be treated well.  He seemed amenable to the idea.  Yeah?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm a huge fan of his work.  How can you not be?  The guy was in Glory.  Well, I was thinking Ferris Bueller's Day Off.  Ferris Bueller, a little bit of Biloxi Blues.  No, no.  Ferris Bueller.  Yeah, that's good, too.  Sure.  I told him about Ferris Bueller.  Very good, Jimmy.  War Games. 
[00:34:00]  I liked War Games.  I forgot about that.  Sure.  He was a little kid in that one.  Joshua?  Do you want to play a...  Joshua?  That was a fine evening, but everyone has heard of the show.  Everyone's aware of the show and what's going on.  Well, yeah.  Well...  I'm not going to get us guests, though.  They're aware of it.  People are also aware of Adolf Hitler.  Yeah, when they show you just walking on TV every day.  And they don't talk about his paintings when they bring him up.  That's true.  John Gacy's stuff is not hanging in the Guggenheim.  It should be. 
[00:34:30]  Hey, really fast, we want to thank Break.com.  We have partnered with Break.com this morning.  So we want the faithful listeners, the hardcore...  Whatever.  Or you, if you're just getting hooked on the Opie and Anthony show  and you're on a computer right now,  we kind of helped pick the videos today  that are on the front page of Break.com.  And they're going to feature a few of ours during the day as well, I believe.  I was on Break.com and show some support.  I was on Break yesterday going through some videos  and laughing my ass off.  The audio we played yesterday of the woman on the roller coaster 
[00:35:00]  is hysterical to watch her.  And it's on Break?  She looks like she's ready to vomit or die.  Yeah, she's on Break.com.  Break.com.  Right.  And then you could go right from that  and then I'm just scrolling  and I put in Apache helicopter  and you could just see some insurgents  just being torn to shreds by Apache helicopters.  It is so amazing to watch our tax dollars at work. 
[00:35:30]  That's what I want to see.  Ah, screw the schools.  Screw the social programs.  I want to see depleted uranium shells tearing through things.  It's amazing.  Yeah.  There's a couple of guys that get out of a truck  and it's all that night vision camera.  And you see their images in white against a very dark background.  But you see their truck.  You see a field.  And one guy runs out and puts down something  that they believe to be some type of RPG in a bag in the field 
[00:36:00]  and then runs back to the truck and they're talking.  And meanwhile, all this chatter, chatter is going on  between the Apache and Command.  And then they tell him,  all right, you know, open up on these guys.  Tear them up.  And you just see,  bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap.  And the images of the people just come apart.  Pieces of them all over this field.  And then another guy kind of took cover under a truck.  And you would assume like a picture of this. 
[00:36:30]  It's pitch black.  You can't see anything.  And you just hear like,  dot, dot, dot, dot, dot.  And you see a flash.  And you know, like that was your guy,  one of your insurgent buddies.  And you take cover underneath something.  It's pitch black.  You got to figure,  I'm so safe, you know.  I'm safe here.  It's dark.  They can't see me.  Og.  They lit up the truck.  And then you see the guy kind of crawling out from the truck.  He's all injured.  He goes, he's injured.  Hit him.  Hit him again.  Bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap. 
[00:37:00]  And he just comes apart.  Wow.  And then they scan the area.  And you see the warm pieces of the people.  Kind of a chunk here,  a chunk there in the farm field.  Chunks.  Warm videos.  Yeah.  And the guys in the cop are just like,  all right, yeah, that looks clear.  All right, done.  Job done.  Let's move on to the next one.  Move on.  So you run the gamut from laughing your ass off to completely horrific on Break.com.  Well, yeah.  So we're helping pick the videos today.  So go there. 
[00:37:30]  Show some support.  Break.com.  Show the power of the show today, will you please?  Speaking of the roller coaster, we played this yesterday.  Now I got to see the video.  It's a British TV reporter who is terrified of roller coasters is forced to ride one.  So the clip starts with her just giving some fun facts and just talking about roller coasters.  Because they're going up the lift.  Right.  They're going up the lift, which is the non-scary part of the roller coaster.  But the second it goes over the top.  Well, going up, you get the nice scenic view.  Yeah, the view.  You start trying to figure out, hey, I think I live right over there. 
[00:38:00]  I love how she's rationalizing, too, the fear.  She's trying to say, you know, they told me, just have fun.  Go with it.  And then the second that thing comes over the top, she's gone.  She loses her mind.  See, I don't think roller coasters are as scary because, you know, you're harnessed in now.  And, like, she's on the one that has the feet dangling.  Yeah, that's where you're kind of hanging there.  The roller coasters that scare the crap out of me are the old school where it's just one bar comes down.  And you're like, how do they know I'm not going to just slide through in the middle of this? 
[00:38:30]  I've been on a few of those where you feel like if I wasn't holding on, I would have flown out on one of those turns.  Were our ancestors drunk or something when it came to safety?  Why did it take, like, only a mere ten years ago we really figured out the safety issues and cars and roller coasters and everything else?  Took a while.  If you really think about when we were growing up and the roller coasters, they would just put a bar down.  Yeah.  That was the same bar they used for fat people, skinny people, little kids.  Fat computers.  And you just held on for dear life.  Remember, sometimes you felt like you were sliding right out of the seat? 
[00:39:00]  Yeah, and you felt like you were going to fly out of the ride.  Yeah.  So I don't think they're as scary when they get those big padded harnesses that come down on you.  You could kind of hug the thing and your feet are dangling.  For some reason, with your feet dangling, I'm not as scared.  You see some of those old rides from Coney Island back in, like, the 20s or something?  Yeah.  With absolutely no safety.  It's just ride the saw.  Right.  You know, they strap you to a saw blade and let you spin around a few times. 
[00:39:30]  And the guy operating it is some drunk.  Oh, they don't know.  Yeah.  They're married three or four times.  He's got a crystal meth habit.  That's fine.  We need somebody.  Get on there.  That's why I'll never go on those stupid, like, carnival rides that come around to town.  And when I was a kid, I always wanted to feel safe.  So, like, when you went up, like, let's say a water flume or something.  Yeah.  And you get to the top and they got that person up there.  And some freaking college kid home for the summer reading a book and getting a suntan. 
[00:40:00]  Yeah.  What's he going to do?  I want some authority figure up there.  He's going to save your life if there's a mishap.  But anyway, here she is.  She's terrified of roller coasters, so, of course, she has to do one for her morning TV show in Britain.  So, it starts off all nice as it's going up the hill.  So, if I can get it underway now as soon as I can, and I'll give you a few facts while I'm going up.  Oh, 110 feet, sorry.  It loops over five times. 
[00:40:30]  It falls at 4.5 G.  And there are eight tons of nuts that are keeping this all together.  I've been reliably informed.  It's suspended over water, and I've been told that it's one of the prettiest roller coasters.  If only I could keep my eyes open long enough to look at the view, apparently it's great.  Now, the tips I've been told are to keep your eyes open and just go with the flow.  Feel it.  Enjoy it.  Look at the sunny day.  Look at the beach.  And as you can say, I'm giving some positive thinking here because I'm...  Oh, I really don't like this.  And look at the 50 yards beneath you.  Yeah, anyway, I'm not... 
[00:41:00]  Yeah, thank you very much, Matt.  And, yeah, that was not very nice of you, by the way.  Oh, I can't actually still hear you, which is all good, but this sun is not very good.  Oh, I don't like it.  Oh, I'm so glad I didn't have Brexit. 
[00:41:30]  It's fun.  Oh, I didn't see the other guy.  Oh, yes.  Do something.  Do something.  Definitely, definitely a horse carousel girl.  I'm really sorry.  I'm an absolute wuss.  Oh, my God.  She was close to crying.  She had those...  Yeah.  She started crying because she knew it was over. 
[00:42:00]  She's like, oh, yes, yes.  And then when it pulls into the little station there, she's like, oh, yes, get me off.  Get me off of here.  Yeah.  There you go.  All right.  In honor of Rock Scream Tuesday, here's a roller coaster girl just isolated, just to scream  part as we go to break.  It's Opie and Anthony.  It's over my eyes.  I don't like it.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:42:30]  Shock, shocks.  Opie and Anthony.  Shock, shocks.  Opie and Anthony.  Shock, shocks.  Opie and Anthony.  Shock, shocks.  Opie and Anthony.  Go.  You're checking out Opie and Anthony  If you have something for the show  877-212-5762  It's not the easiest number to remember  But that's the one we got right now  It's impossible to remember  You just said it, I don't remember 
[00:43:00]  I don't remember it, right  877-212-5762  5762 is what?  I know they don't want us to say it  It says K-Rock  But the problem is we're on 20 some odd stations across America  You know, we're on the edge in Buffalo  They don't want us to say in K-Rock  It's going to confuse everybody  So as far as we're concerned  We have to give out the actual number  Which is 877-212-5762  You think the people listening on The Wolf  Want to hear K-Rock? 
[00:43:30]  It confuses everybody  So we have to just use the regular number  877-212-5762  We should come up with a number  That is universal for all the stations  We're broadcasting on  Didn't we try to figure out  Didn't we try to figure out  If the numbers made another word  Aside from K-Rock  And it made nothing?  Yeah, it was the worst combination  Of numbers ever  We can't spell anything else  With 5762  It's like  Al-1-slob  Or something  Was the 212 included or no? 
[00:44:00]  That's with the 212, yeah  Well, how about just  What is 5762?  There's got to be a four-letter word  We could use there, no?  No, because it's two consonants  In a row to get technical  Oh, my God  Yeah, oh, my God  They gave us the worst number ever  Again, right now  I couldn't tell you what the number is  5762-877-212-5762  And what I learned  Back in the day  You've got to make it very easy  For the listeners  Yeah  You've got to spoon feed them  Everything has to be very easy 
[00:44:30]  They don't want to do  The heavy lifting  They don't have to  They don't want to use  Their memory skills  No  So they can call in  Their favorite radio show  If they have to  Concentrate so much  On the phone number  They're going to forget  What the hell  They wanted to call about  Someone get me  Can you get me  I'm good at this stuff  I'll have a word  But in a little while  Someone get me the letters  That are on the phone  I'll have a good word  Alrighty, Jim  Alright, we'll figure something out  So it's 877-212-5762  A newsreader clip  Jack Cafferty  Oh, that was Jack Cafferty, too? 
[00:45:00]  Yeah, he comes across  Speaking of news people, by the way  Our favorite traffic reporter  Jill Nicolini  Jill Nicolini  Long Island girl  That we're trying to put over  Although I think Channel 11  Already knows they have a star  In the making  It's the longest traffic report  You'll ever see on a TV news show  To summarize, she's a hot piece of ass  She's been in Playboy  She used to do the in-stadium  Or in-arena announcements  For the New York Islanders 
[00:45:30]  Google her if you're listening, Mr. Alda  Oh, yeah, you better Google her  Google Jill Nicolini  And Jill does the traffic  Like she's doing weather  Because they're basically  Getting her ready to take over  For the old bra that does the weather  She's built better than  Hot Lips Houlihan  Wow  And then she's gonna be  Hot Lips was never sexy  She was  No, she wasn't  Matronly  She was matronly  Motherly  No, Jim  No  I was never into the hot lips 
[00:46:00]  Never into hot lips  I liked her backside  Occasionally Hawkeye would pull out  With these nurses  That were really hot  For the old school one  Yeah, yeah  One of them was  Cotter's wife  Was it?  Yeah, Cotter's wife  Oh, I remember that one  Did you talk to him  About that episode?  No, but I would've  Because I was like  You said the blood of Jill  I just deduced Jill  Thinking about myself  Oh, no  Did you bring up an episode  And say  I should be sure  What did you say?  Because I heard that line  And I know that line  What did you bring up?  I don't remember  What did you bring up? 
[00:46:30]  Come on, let's go, Jimmy  Say it  I'm like you said  Because there's this thing  He says to Radar  Because he was happy  I said something about  You talk about  How your job is  To pull bodies  Out of a sausage grinder  Which it is  And that was a great line  He goes, yeah  I wrote that thing  He was really proud  That I remember that  And I'm like  You actually said  To stand in the blood  Of children in a sitcom  And I was like  As I said  I'm like  You melodramatic nothing  Oh, my God  Jimmy, I won't be looking at you  For the rest of the program  I can't  I can't  Were you using your hands  As you were saying it? 
[00:47:00]  Yes, man  He was hunched in  Listening to me  Sitting on a bar stool  You said  Like he was excited  Because you started off  Well with him  And he's thinking  Wow, I think I might have  A new person  I can hang out with  That's not going to spend  His whole time  In front of me  Talking about MASH  Or at least talking about  I don't know  No, you said  I felt it slip away  Oh, you did  I felt it slip away  It's like  Damn, I'm losing him  I almost said that  And it went  Bye, Alan  Bye  I'm sorry  I'm a nobody  You thought he had  A cool friend  He could chat with  Jimmy introduced me to 
[00:47:30]  Did you say  I'm losing him  Come on  Don't let the bastard win  Someone else  I watch people annoy him  And I'll say this for myself  I knew when to punch out  You did  I did not annoy him  I didn't walk over  And say goodbye  At the end  We had a nice handshake  And that when he finally  Saw my hands  Standing like a wooden soldier  I had a conversation  With Corbin Bernson  That's what I picture  Just a regular conversation  Two guys  Me, Corbin Bernson  That was from Seinfeld  Speaking of Seinfeld 
[00:48:00]  Jimmy introduced me  To Jerry Seinfeld  At Colin Quinn's  Kind of bachelor party  Slash roast  And after the whole thing  Was over  Like Seinfeld's on stage  Because he's good friends  With Colin Quinn  And he came  And he roasted him  A little bit  And so I'm on stage  And I get introduced  To Jerry Seinfeld  I'm like don't even  Mention Seinfeld  Don't even mention Seinfeld  Don't even bring it up  Don't even say  You're a big fan  Good boy  Good boy  So Comedian was out  And I'm like man  I saw Comedian  I thought it was great 
[00:48:30]  I really liked the  Behind the scenes look  Of you you know  Trying out new material  And getting it to a place  Where you can bring it  To you know  To a mass audience  And he was really happy  That I brought that up  In that Seinfeld  He's like oh thank you  You know whatever  Thank you  And then  Nothing  Hey that episode  Of Seinfeld  And I realized  Without mentioning Seinfeld  I had nothing else  To say to him  I'm like  So uh  Yeah I really liked it 
[00:49:00]  And we're purposely  Giving you silence here  Because it was just  Awkward silence  Oh that hurts  Looking at each other  And I'm like  Alright take care  And jumped off the stage  And my whole body  Was heating up  He's an intimidating guy  Man Seinfeld  He really is  Because he's  This is what I love  About him  He's brutally honest  Like yeah  He won't do anything  He doesn't want to do  Yeah  There was a picture  People want  I saw him do it  It was at the comedy  Cellar  These Israeli guys  Want to take a photo  With him 
[00:49:30]  And he's okay with that  He's like okay  And the guy went  To put his arm around Jerry  And Jerry goes  We don't know each other  We don't need to touch  And he wasn't being awful  But I was like  Wow he means it  Just brutal  Did you see that  HBO thing  I think it was  Maybe Showtime  I'm not sure which one  They did the  They had Robert Klein  And Chris Rock  And Jerry was up there  And they were kind of  Honoring his work  It was HBO  As a matter of fact  Because they had  The head of HBO  Come out  And Jerry was just 
[00:50:00]  The whole time  Looking so awkward  Being there  And like  What's this pomp  And circumstance  Over you know  My career  And he got up  To give a speech  At the end  And it was just  Hysterically brutal  He brutalized  The president of HBO  He brutalized  The whole event  Of him just sitting there  On a stage  On a chair  While an audience  Just gawked at him  He abused the audience  For being there  For something like this  He is just brutal  He's not that  He's not Jerry Seinfeld 
[00:50:30]  From Seinfeld  Right right  He's got like  Parts of that  But it's not like  A fun guy  Kind of a thing  He doesn't seem like  He's a fun guy  Quite frankly  The beauty of him  Is he like  He like knows  How much money he has  And he'll like  Joke with the audience  About it  About like  Yeah it's great being me  And he's like  He doesn't pull that  Shy crap  And I was trying to  Because like  I was talking to him  One time about  The Mets Yankees  World Series  This guy back a few years  And we were talking  About the Subway Series  We had something to bond over  Because I'm a Yankee fan  And then Colin came over 
[00:51:00]  And just blocked the whole thing  Shut up  Then he just ruined it for me  And I had nothing else  To say to Jerry  He'll tell Jerry to shut up  He never calls Jerry back  Colin's not impressed  That's why Colin  That's why Colin sucks  Because you find  The one thing  You can talk to someone about  And he blows up your spot  He'll just ruin it for you  But we went off  We went off road here  Jill Nicolini  Oh right  So Jill Nicolini  How did we get to Seinfeld  From Jill Nicolini  People we like to have sex with  That's how I got there 
[00:51:30]  Jerry's very funny  And very rich  So Long Island girl  Doing well  She's the traffic girl  And she does the longest  Traffic report  For local TV  Here in New York  With graphics  And green screens  And all sorts of stuff  Amazing what they've given her  They give her animated cars  And like a five camera shoot  Showing every bridge and tunnel  In New York City  And her whole deal  Is to just wear  Really hot outfits  Every morning  She does the traffic  Yeah  She pretty much wears  The clothes she goes out in  And there  You can picture her 
[00:52:00]  Out at some Long Island club  There she is  She is  And the point I'm making  We gotta get a screen cap  Of her every day  Today she's wearing  Pink frosting  It looks like  Pink cake frosting  Is spread all over her body  But it's some kind of like  Little pink fond number  It looks like pink frosting  It's barely covering anything  Yeah  And there she is  Just doing the traffic  No one cares  And they're not listening to me  They're showing  Too much of the cartoon cars  Show her the whole time  No one gives a crap  You know 
[00:52:30]  Showing live shots  Of actual traffic  Moving through highway  No  Just show her  And have her tell people  Where the problem spots are  And then they go to  The weather broad  Who's a little older  And as she's trying  To do the weather  She's looking to her left  Because she's like  She gets pissed  Because she sees  She sees her replacement  Getting closer and closer  And then she's gonna  Replace her  And then she's gonna go  Into the entertainment  Reporter's seat  And then  A mere two years from now  Anchor  She'll be the anchor 
[00:53:00]  They know what they're  Doing over there  Network anchor  Look pink frosting today  See  Did you see how  She just looked to the left  Yeah Linda Church  Looks over at her  Like I remember  When I was that age  Yeah Jill will finish  Up her traffic  They go to Linda Church  For the weather  And the first shot  Of Linda is  She's looking off  To the left  At Jill obviously  On set  Yeah  Going oh my god  Yeah get a screen cap  Of what she's wearing  Every day we should do that  For the rest of the country  And then we challenge  Everyone else 
[00:53:30]  We're like hey  Find a hot abroad  On TV  Doing like you know  Local news  And we haven't seen anything  No  We haven't seen anything  That comes close to her  Except for  You can't count  The Spanish news stations  No  That is almost pornography  It really is  Very close to porno  Alright  Can I point out  The worst part of Colin  Which I just thought of  Oh yeah  This is why I hate him  Because he points out  Exactly what you're doing  And humiliates you  Like  He'll say something like  What are you trying to do  Bond with Seinfeld  Over sports  Shut your mouth 
[00:54:00]  And like Seinfeld knows  That's what you were  Trying to do  And you know  What were you going to say  No  And what does Jerry  Give that little smirk  Like yeah  That's what he was doing  Colin  The best part is when  Oh god  Seinfeld and the stupid  Colin walked out of  The cellar one time  And Manny was still alive  And they both  Seinfeld's a freak  For those wings  And so is Colin  And there was a 20  And a 5  And Manny goes  I guess we know  Who ate at what plate  And Colin left a 5  And Seinfeld left a 20  It was so satisfying  Fat shizler  To slap Colin 
[00:54:30]  Right in his mouth  Gotta get him back  On the show  I miss him  He's a Caroline  Jackass  We'll get him on  Jackass  Oh newsreader  So Jack Cafferty  Who's like a legend  Here in New York  He's a grouchy  He seems like a grouchy bastard  He's a douche  Is he?  I think so yeah  I just  He looks grouchy  But he has been in  The news for forever  And I guess  He got a little upset  Yeah  Well he's also the one  Who's 
[00:55:00]  When Anna Cole's death broke  Yeah that's right  He's the one who said  Oh she's still dead  Yeah she's still dead  No one cared  Yeah he doesn't sugarcoat it  There wasn't any outrage  When he said that  Because no one cared  About the dead stripper  Yeah he doesn't sugarcoat it  But yesterday  It's a quick clip  He scolds  The guy operating  His teleprompter  On CNN  Uh huh  It was going a little too slow  For Jack Cafferty  Worse than Watergate  That is how  Democratic Congressman 
[00:55:30]  Jerry Nadler  Describes the actions  Of the Bush administration  When it comes  You want to scroll  The prompter up  So I can continue here  No that's backwards  Turn it the other way  No that's  How condescending  That is  No that's backwards  Turn it the other way  Idiot  I don't understand  Why they don't  Memorize this stuff  Or at least part of it  They don't have to  They don't even know  What they're reading  I bet you have to  You know what it is  There's too much news 
[00:56:00]  There's too many stories now  Yeah  When you had your  Uh uh  You know  Old time reporters  That would get out there  And actually get the story  And then get behind  The anchor desk  And give the news  Sure  Took them way back  They had a couple of stories  What was happening  In the  The NOM  What was happening  On the home front  Couple of uh  Local stories  And boom  They're done  Until the next day  Now there's  80,000 stories  Pouring in  That teleprompter  Is just flying 
[00:56:30]  With words  Flying in front of them  To read anything  There's no way  To memorize stuff anymore  There's no way  To remember  What the hell  What was  What were the big stories  Yesterday  Yesterday  On CNN  Or Fox  News  Yesterday  Yesterday  Uh  I'm sure that  You know  Palestinian  Hamas  Situation  Was big  But  I just know that  Because it's still  Kind of in the news  Wait

[01:13:30]  Because it craps out like that  Why would you need a satellite if it's cable  That was really dumb  Exactly  How many guys in vans right now  Are saying I'm an idiot  I think they do bounce some stuff off of satellites though  Do they  It's an HBO satellite  It's got to get from point A to point B  And then it's distributed through the cable  How does it get into the cable then  If it's under the ground  In a big building  With a big dish on the roof  And then it goes into the ground  And then oh it's all over the cables  They use funnel technology  Funnel technology  Yeah they get it into the ground  Yep  Funnel it in 
[01:14:00]  Yeah they funnel it in  There's a guy in there  Pouring some kind of shows  Into a funnel  This thing goes into the cables  It's got a liquid show  That's great  When did you do it?  Friday  Oh cool  Congratulations  I saw a something  I don't know whether you can talk about it or not  But I'm not going to bring up anything like that  But I saw perhaps there's a pilot  That's all I'm going to say  There was  There was  Bring it up Andy  There wasn't 
[01:14:30]  It didn't get picked up?  No it did not  Bastards  What are you going to do?  All I saw of it was on a message board  It said Bill Burr in pilot?  Question mark  Pilot?  Oh yeah  So I was like  I was hoping it was some kind of a sexual thing that happened  Bill Burr in pilot  Punch us  Something that happened on some US air flight  Nah I shot a pilot and it didn't get picked up  I knew it wasn't going to get picked up  Because everyone was just like  I think this thing's going to go 
[01:15:00]  Really?  It's definitely going to go  And once people start saying that  You know it's going down the drain  What was it?  Do you want to say it?  It was called Playing Chicken  Right  Playing Chicken  That was the name  Yeah  It was about two brothers  One was left wing  One was right wing  And together  You know  You know  You always have to have complete opposites  But it was actually  It was actually  It was a good time  Two brothers  One black  One white  And together  Therein lies the conflict  Right  Now one of them was injured in a car wreck 
[01:15:30]  He was playing chicken on a jet ski  Oh on a jet ski  Yeah neither one turned away  And then he got paralyzed  There's the comedy  Yeah  Yeah so that was the thing  They were kind of going for more of like an edgier thing  And well it was a good time  And we did  I've never bombed  With a group of people before  Like we did  After the first run  The first run through we did  Like we went really  We went for big air on the edginess 
[01:16:00]  Right  Like the opening scene was  We were getting ice cream  And some homeless guy came up  Asking for change  And the guy in the wheelchair  Turned around and flicked his ice cream at him  Which we all thought was hilarious  Of course it is  Yeah and I think it was right after the Imus thing  So they were already extra sensitive  So the whole network people were standing there  I heard a gasp  And then afterwards  Come on  And then zero laughs in the scene  But it's not a real homeless person  And it's an actor right  Yeah  Babies  Oh it was great 
[01:16:30]  So then like by the third scene of no laughter  I was just looking into the eyes  Of the other actors  And the look of panic on a couple of them  Was just hilarious  And I was already in my head  You never get to hear this behind the scenes stuff  Oh this is great  We were bombing so bad  I was already in my head going  Well I still you know  I still got stand up gigs  I got stand up gigs  Hoping Anthony  Did me great  As you're filming it  Yeah as the lines are just pouring out of my mouth  But then  It was like a feel good movie though  So then we were up against the wall  We literally went home after that run through 
[01:17:00]  Me and this dude Norbert  And he's like  I'm getting fired  I'm like nah I'm getting fired  Dude I got zero laughs  I got minus ten laughs  Wait  Who was supposed to laugh  The studio audience  No no no  You do like the run through  Like in front of the network  Yeah but who were you hoping was going to laugh  Because those  The writers  The execs  Those people never laugh right  That's what I've heard over the years  They wrote it  Some of the writers will because they wrote it  They wanted to work  Oh really  So it was like an awkward laugh  Because you know that guy wrote that line  Sometimes yeah  Yeah I don't know what they were expecting  But evidently we did like the exact opposite 
[01:17:30]  So then  Everything I've heard about that stuff  The people  The cameraman  The floor director  All these people  Never give you a laugh  On set  I haven't done enough of them  To know that  But I mean  I just know like  As a comedian  When you go up in front of  Like an industry crowd  It's brutal  Yeah that's what I'm getting at  Because I think they're more  Sitting there looking at you  Like where's the show  Where's the show  Rather than just  Sitting there enjoying it  So anyway  So we bombed horrifically  On a Friday  And like we didn't know  What was going to happen  And then  It was like a feel good movie  Like someone should have like  Filmed it 
[01:18:00]  Because then we kind of  Changed the tone a little bit  Yeah  And we did the next run through  Then it killed  And then it just  The crescendo  As we did it  In front of the live audience  And it destroyed  And we were all  Hi fast  Wow  Everybody's going  You're going to get picked up  And blah blah blah  And then it all came  Crashing down again  Because it didn't get picked up  With one phone call  Of  How were you told  Where were you  I don't even remember  What happened  I know  I was at  I was at  Giggles in Seattle  In their beautiful  Their beautiful dressing room  Oh my god 
[01:18:30]  Oh you were  That print  Wait what  These guys can't comprehend  And picture you find out  The worst news of your life  Picking up your chewing gum  In a buddy booth  It's one of the things  Where like they have  All the extra beer  Is stocked there  Like that's the room  Yeah  And for some reason  There was this cardboard cut out  Of Princess Lair  When she was in that  Whore outfit  When she was with  Jabba the Hutt  That was behind me  And my manager called up  Yeah listen buddy  Didn't get picked up 
[01:19:00]  But listen man  It's still a good thing  You booked a pilot  And you know  On to bigger and better things  For 07  Yeah  Alright  Alright  Cool  Cool  Yeah  That was a good experience  And then you hang up  Oh dude  You sitting in that green room  You want to  Is your feet sticky from beer  You want to kill yourself  You're looking around like  Ah  Just a few days ago  We thought that  The ticket out was there  Yeah  I had the comedians  For the rest  The guy hosting  For the rest of the weekend  Part of the intro  Was he just found out 
[01:19:30]  His pilot didn't get picked up  Oh really  Yeah  Half the crowd  Kind of got it  And the other half  Thought like  You know  Who's this  You know  Wise ass  Yeah  Right  Did you think  Some of the lines were funny  Yeah  It was actually  I mean for a sitcom  For a pilot episode  Yeah  I thought  I thought it was  It had a shot  Dude it was both  It was like  Whenever you go to do a sitcom  There's like  Half of you going like  Hey this is funny  And then you're also thinking like  God am I going to be  The next Urkel  Like  Is this  Yeah  Because you have no idea 
[01:20:00]  How it's going to play out  How they're going to edit it  Which way they're going to go with it  It's just getting harder and harder  To be funny  Like on the radio  TV  And movies  Because all the PC crap  And all the worries  That you know  The big boys have  It's becoming a nightmare  Well that Imus thing happened  Like right before  We did the run through  So they were even saying  That that  I don't know  I think we were grasping for straws  Rather than just saying  We kind of bummed  Oh boy  That's funny though  Flicking ice cream  I think the flicking ice cream  At the bum  Is better than that  Like if that got picked up  People would like that more 
[01:20:30]  Than you know  Feel good  Kind of  Dude it was  It was like  That was one of those things  That they had just done  In front of a studio audience  That was just you know  Through doing  Like you know  Years of doing stand up  You know what's going to  Because there was other stuff  Where I'm like  Dude this isn't going to be funny  This is just going to be gross  Yeah  And you know  No it's good  It's good  Not to make myself  Out to be this all knowing thing  But you definitely know  How to gross out a crowd  After doing like stand up 
[01:21:00]  For a minute  But there were some things  That I thought was funny  Like yeah let me throw  This line in  You know  I'm the comedian  I know it's funny  And then it would totally bomb  And then I'd have to walk back  Behind that fake wall  With my head down  Like  Maybe what you wrote  Was better  Hey let's go to Scott  In Cleveland  Scott what's up  Morning Owen hey  How you guys doing  Here we got Bill Burr in studio  Little Jimmy  Hi  Hi  Hey  Sorry Bill  Billy when are you coming back  Oh there you go  Cleveland  Uh  December  December  Yeah

[01:22:00]  Yeah  Yes  What if I do a rock scream  And everyone laughs at me  What sir  What Scott  What if I do a rock scream  And everyone can laugh at me  Alright do a rock scream  Alright rock scream Tuesday  It is rock scream Tuesday  Alright  Phil is so confused  No that's not a good rock scream dude  That sucked  It's alright  Alright Scott  Thank you

[01:23:00]  68 to 64 games  That's what I hate  About sports though  You're like  You follow  You know  The sport all season  And then it's time  For the finals  Like in this case  The NBA finals  And it's over  In like two and a half days  And it's a  You know  A sweep  Nothing exciting about it  The sweep  Is the funniest thing ever  For the town that loses  Because  Right as you're excited  You get like mid-sentence  Hey I think we can really  They just smack you across  It's over  And you're making plans  For like game three 
[01:23:30]  And it's like  They're already down to nothing  And you know  It's not going to get any better  Which just sucks  Because they're fighting it out  All year  For like nine straight months  And then the finals  Is a 4-0 sweep  That no one cared about really  The ratings were  Yeah  San Antonio  They're just like  They're just technicians  Yeah  They're going to turn around  They use the glass  Everybody's going to use  They like beat you  In like this YMCA  What do you mean  They use the glass  I'm just saying  Like Tim Duncan  He's got that  That jump shot

[01:36:30]  That there has been  A tragedy  In the WWE  That the chairman  Mr. McMahon  Is indeed  Dead  A horrible  Fiery  Limousine explosion  Claimed his life  Last week  Supposedly  They haven't found the body  But I've seen the charred limo  I saw the explosion  I saw him get into the limo  You saw that big sport coat  Laying in the road  No they have not  They have not found anything 
[01:37:00]  Size 63  Size 63  It's that giant jacket  I liked him in the 70's  When he was all roided up  He had that big neck  Size 63  Shoulder  Giant  Yeah  And a 27 inch waist  Yeah  Yeah  Daniel Lyle Elzato  The video clip  They blew up his limo  After he got in it  But all of a sudden  Like his foot was in the limo  And then it came back out  And it was dangling  Like a fake foot  And then went back in  And then the limo exploded  So he's with the fake foot theory 
[01:37:30]  The super Dave Osborne  Yeah yeah  Fake foot super Dave  And then we've been doing  Our own investigation  We found out there was a  Pyrotechnics crew from LA  That was flown into Wilkes-Burre  To pull up the limo  A day before he got in it  You know we're way on top of this  And Sam over here  Just wants to believe  Sam  Now Sam would like to believe  That Vince is alive  Because he's taking this very hard  I wish I could  He wishes he could  Well I guess  Do you want the  Stephanie McMahon audio first  Yeah we start out 
[01:38:00]  Now this is from last night  Yeah last night's Raw  Was another  Everybody's still getting over  The tragedy  So you still watch wrestling  Oh yeah  Let me ask you this  Are you aware of the UFC  Which is basically  The real deal  Guys talk smack  And then they actually  Beat the crap out of each other  For real  Yeah but it doesn't have  The pizzazz  Oh that was  Are you a fan of musicals  No pizzazz  Pizzazz is the new tag team  They're all the pizzazz  Is uh 
[01:38:30]  You obviously are a big WWE fan  The biggest  Yeah  And uh  Vince McMahon  The tragic loss  Is really uh  Shaking him up  What's happening with  Chief J Strongbow's storyline  He hasn't been around  For a little while  I heard he got beat  By Larry Zabisco  Wow  Larry Zabisco  That's great  A couple other things  For Bill  They also uh  Flew the flag  At half mass  Up there in Stanford  Well  Well  Not the American flag  No no  The WWE flag  Right  Was being flown  At half mass  Because they knew  What kind of crap 
[01:39:00]  They'd catch  That they  Oh yeah  Flew the American flag  At half mass  Sam still wants to believe  When they still  Don't have a body  Is what I mean  Presumed dead  Presumed dead  And instead of having  The FBI investigate  This uh  Limo explosion  In Wilkes-Barre  Pennsylvania  They got the what  Well they had  Federal investigators  From the  Federal investigation  Uh council  Or center  Federal investigation  Center  Now now  Right when this  Happened  Rec room  Right  Federal agencies  No they're apparently  A lot higher than the FBI  But when this first started 
[01:39:30]  I guess uh  WWE was putting out  Statements that the FBI  Was looking into this  And then all of a sudden  It turned into the FIC  Yeah  Which is the Federal  Investigation  Center  Center  Everyone is pretty much  Pissed off about this  Storyline  Because the FBI  Put out a statement  Saying look  We don't know anything  About a car bomb  Yeah we would have  Been involved in this  Right  We're worried about  Tourists entering America  Yeah yeah  Leave us out of  Your stupid storyline  The ATF would have  Been involved  Uh uh  Like a lot  A bunch of people  The Wilkes-Barre  Pennsylvania 
[01:40:00]  Police Department  Which was uh  Where the venue was  When this happened  Has uh  In a statement  Said the explosion  Um  At the Wachovia Arena  Was a staged event  Overseen by firefighters  And that Mr. McMahon  Was not injured  Well that's  Silly  Because obviously  He was injured  Well he's  Presumed dead  Presumed dead  Now Sam has brought up  A good point  That the  Wilkes-Barre  Township Police Department  Is so botched 
[01:40:30]  This case  Yeah  That they are now  Just denying  It ever happened  Yeah  Because they've botched  The investigation  Uh  They left evidence  In the sun  Yeah yeah  They've just ruined  The investigation  Now the FIC  Has to step in  And that is why  They're now  Saying that  That this happened  Another day  And was supervised  But that's all crap  Right  That's ridiculous  I mean they got  The case taken away  From them  Almost immediately  By the FIC  Yeah  Not the FBI  No no not the FBI  FBI is busy with smaller things 
[01:41:00]  This is the FIC  Now um  Stephanie McMahon  Yeah  Last night  Uh what show was it last night  It was on Raw  And uh  She had an emotional  Emotional statement  Finally though  To hear from the McMahon family  I think that was very  Very good  And we have to keep in mind  That last Sunday  Was the first Father's Day  That Shane and Stephanie  Did not have their father  Did not have their father  In the ring with them  At the same time  Uh  No  No  I mean  I'm sure they had a fine meal  Behind the scenes 
[01:41:30]  You idiot  Behind the scenes  He's presumed dead  OB  And the guy  Just think of the McMahon  Mansion  I'm sure  That huge  Palatial mansion  Uh  No matter how big  And how richly  Uh  Uh  Decorated the place is  How alone  Those kids must have been  That probably was the loneliest place in America  Exactly  And with the  Uh  But thank God  I want to right now  Say  Thank you  To CNN  Fox News  All the big news agencies 
[01:42:00]  For letting  The family grieve  And not even reporting on it  At all  The fact that  A chairman  Of a company  Was blown up  In a limousine  Right  And it  They haven't even touched  The story  By one of his employees  That is still on the loose  And they've given  This family  The privacy  That they never give  People  Well they asked for the privacy  Now  And the media said  I will give you  Your privacy  For the first time  Ever  In the media's history  They decided to 
[01:42:30]  To give the privacy  Sam  Do you have  Do you have an explanation  As to maybe  Why these news agencies  Would give the family  This privacy  Well they saw the way  The Wilkes-Barre  Police department  Flubbed to the point  That they're denying  It ever happened  Yeah  So they're saying  You know  We're not going to  Mess this up more  We want to see  Somebody come to justice  It's an open investigation  Alright  And obviously  We saw on television  Last night  That the investigators  Are questioning people  Alright let's go  Now that got me too  Before we get right 
[01:43:00]  To the tape here  The investigator  From the FIC  Yes  Was at Smackdown  No at Raw  At Raw  I'm sorry  He was at Raw  Yeah  Conducting the investigation  Yeah  Now why wasn't he  At FIC headquarters  Like in an interrogation room  Maybe questioning suspects  Like Mick Foley  Yeah with some foam books  And some rough lighting  Instead of having  Ringside seats  Yeah  I see Bobby Lashley  As a big suspect  I'm putting my money  That crime time  Had something to do  About this  Crime time by the way 
[01:43:30]  My newest favorite  Is the tag team ever  These two  They're two black guys  Who apparently  Own items  That were stolen  From Mr. McMahon  And apparently  What do they do sometimes  Well they tried to sell  The McMahon items  As a memorial  On television  Last night  They're selling  Vince's stuff  On TV  But what have they  Done in the past  Well in the past  One of them  Will distract  Jerry the King Lawler  While he's doing  Color commentary  While the other  Takes his laptop  Off the table 
[01:44:00]  And writes to the banks  It's hysterical  They say what  The UFC does  His laptop  His computer  I love wrestling  I'm just trying to  Trash it  It's so funny  Of course  Paul London's a suspect  And John Sennett  Is a suspect  It's pronounced  Cena  Excuse me  I don't know  I don't know  We've had him on the show  And he's a great guy  He wasn't a wrestler  When he was on the show  He was in a movie  Alright  You want the Stephanie  McMahon audio  From last night  Please  Alright here

[01:47:30]  Yeah  And you have a bunch of people  With bad acting around it  Yeah  They'll never believe it  Tell all the people  That it's a work  All that like  Wrestlers and everything  But only  Stephanie and Shane O'Mac  Know that they actually  Murdered their father  How about he's still alive now  And he's like  We got him fooled  And he's out back  Having breakfast  Or that  Yeah  And he comes by  And just blows his head off  And her and Shane  Like bury him  At the compound  Right  And then  They just are like  Where's Vince  Yeah you know 
[01:48:00]  He blew up in that car  We told you  He blew up in the car  And for years  They just keep telling  The FIC  Or whatever  The FIC  We're still going  With that storyline  Investigators  Ratings are off the hook  We gotta stay with this  We gotta stay with the storyline  Alright  Oh Vince is really dead  Or if he chokes  Or if he chokes  On an eggshell  And died in some  Accidental death  And died in some awful way  Yeah  If he slips on a mop and glow  And no one believes it  Or yeah  It's an accidental death  At this point  And then they really  Arrest those kids  And throw them in jail  Over a dumb storyline 
[01:48:30]  Now some of you  Might feel that  Mr. McMahon  Doesn't deserve  A celebration  Mr. McMahon  Was not loved  He was not sympathetic  And he was not kind  What?  Do you know  That Mr. McMahon  Is the only man  I have ever known  As my dad  Aww  And my dad  Is the most important  Person in this world  Was  Was 
[01:49:00]  I meant was  I mean was  Past tense  Because  He's dead  That crowd was lame  Where's one  One drunk dude  Standing up  And going  Show your  Show your  Nothing man  No  No creativity  In that audience  Last night  It's a time of grieving  Right now  Yeah  I understand  Time of grieving  One more quick clip  And then we'll give you  The update  That's just  I'm sorry Sam  It's over for you 
[01:49:30]  Well  And this Sunday's  Pay-per-view  Pay-per-view  Plugin  Might be named  Vengeance  But Vengeance  Will  Be true  What?  What?  What?  How about she  Writes it down  I mean I know  These wrestlers  Like to kind of  Go  You know  One row  One row beneath  Her link  On WWE.com  Yeah  The link  To watch  This speech  Yeah  That Stephanie  Has given  Her emotional speech  About her dead dad 
[01:50:00]  Yeah  Is the diva hot box  Where it shows  All the sexy divas  Of the WWE  Yes  They haven't like  Wiped the site off  And just put a picture  Of Vince up there  Why not an R.I.P.  With just Vince's picture  A couple of weeks  Of just the memorial  Yeah it would be all black  With whatever year  Whatever year  Whatever  Exactly  Why not that for a week or two  I see it down there  It says in memory  Of Mr. McMahon  1945 to 2007  Where is that bird  It's well below  The diva hot box  If you look at what that actually is 
[01:50:30]  And Rise of the Hardys  It's actually  Cell phone wallpaper  And WWE shop  The official website  Store  The memorial picture  Is cell phone wallpaper  That you can purchase  For yourself  Exactly  And 24-7  Online summer skin  You can download  Some of your favorite  Girls from the  Daily diva  They buried the  Vince's dead lake  How do you think  He's coming back  Do you think  They're going to do  The hacky  Tattered clothes  With fake dirt  On his face  Like a cartoon  Or are they going to go  With the full body cast 
[01:51:00]  You know with the leg up  And the arm  Eye triangle above you  I foresee a masked  Somehow masked wrestler  Who will be Vince  What?  He'll come back  For vengeance  You're going to see  The baloney boots  Whoa  No no no  It doesn't necessarily  Have to be him  That 62 year old man  It doesn't necessarily  Have to be him  At one point  Like a glove will come off  And you'll see a burnt hand  And the guy will scramble  To put the glove back on  And run off  And they'll be like  Oh my god  That might be Vince 
[01:51:30]  That'll be the first clue  But it won't be him  It won't be him  It'll be a real wrestler guy  And then at the end  It'll be Vince maybe  With some makeup on  Or something  No Vince will come  From somewhere else  Yeah  Everyone thinks  Mask guy is Vince  That'll be somebody else  Vince will come  From somewhere else  I would actually  From the back of the arena  With his eyes  As wide as possible  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  You thought I was dead  Well I'm not  How funny would it be  If there was no reaction 
[01:52:00]  To the crowd  If you said that  And then two people  Are like yeah  Wow  Sam I hate  That we actually  Brought up the fact  That he might be alive  Kind of a thing  I know how that upset me  We got the last bit  Of the Stephanie clip here  Alright  The moment  That my family  Finds out  Who did this  To my dad  Dad  I love you  Aw  She dropped the mic  And walked out  Wow yeah 
[01:52:30]  She just was overcome  With grief  Right  Just in case  One of the wrestlers  Die  She doesn't want  To be accused  Of murdering them  Thinking that  That wrestler  And these wrestlers  Drop off  You know  I mean  And her motivation  To get the real tears  Going was how bad  She sucks at acting  I just look so bad  Acting  Alright  This  I can't get out of this  This just came in now  This is a news flash  I imagine that  Vince is going to be  On TV by the end  Of the week  Because now he's  Messing with the stock  And that's not good  In staged limo explosion 
[01:53:00]  Publicly traded  WWE gets away  With murder  And it says  That most companies  The execution style  Murder of the chairman  Would be a cause for alarm  As it is  At World Wrestling Entertainment  It's just another day  In the ring  In a news release  Put out on Business Wire  And fed into the company  Research pages on websites  Including Yahoo  TheStreet.com  And WallStreetJournal.com  Wrestling promoter  WWE reported that  At the end of Monday Night Raw  On USA Network  Chairman Vince McMahon's 
[01:53:30]  Limousine suddenly exploded  After Vince McMahon  Got into the vehicle  The release adds  Quote  Although full details  Have not been disclosed  Initial reports  Indicate that Mr. McMahon  Is presumed dead  An official investigation  Into Monday Night's event  Is currently underway  Throughout the night  People from Mr. McMahon's past  From Donald Trump  To Snoop Dogg  To Bob Costas  Stone Cold Steve Austin  Had less than flattering  Things to say  About the WWE chairman  But would go only  As far as  But would any  Go so far  As to actually  Blow him up 
[01:54:00]  Would they?  That's the question  I'm asking  Exactly  Police in Wilkes-Barre  Township, Pennsylvania  In a statement  Said the explosion  At the Wachovia Arena  Was staged  Overseen by firefighters  And that Mr. McMahon  Wasn't injured  Quote  Contrary to what is being  Reported on internet websites  And other media sources  Unquote  Is what they're saying  That this is a  Staged event  The WWE  Had no public comment  Beyond what was in  The release  So what they're saying  Is  And they have a picture  Of Vince  With his eyes open  Real wide 
[01:54:30]  His mouth open  And it says  Vince McMahon  If it were any other firm  The SEC  Would howl  The Security and Exchange Commission  If you said like  Out of nowhere  That the chairman  Of a big company  Was blown up  And murdered  In a limo  It would affect  The stock price  And the SEC  Would get involved  And they would  Absolutely get involved  If you were staging this  And saying he's dead  And that's the thing  They're not  I bet you they're doing  A rewrite in Stanford  Behind closed doors  Like  Oh wait a minute 
[01:55:00]  We're in trouble  With Wall Street  This could affect  My money  I'm alive  There'll be a videotape  Or something  He's kidnapped  Or something  They'll be  So they can keep  The storyline going  He'll be in like  A dungeon somewhere  You gotta help me  Ransom  Buy  I mean sell  Buy  Buy  Sell  Or they'll email his finger  Like that awful bad guy  From Escape from New York  He was trying to be creepy 
[01:55:30]  But he was dressed like  He was in a Pat Benatar video  Or the guy that bought  The president's brain  He was supposed to be  Like really frightening  Just a douche  With frosted hair  Brain  What an ass  Hey let's go to Long Island  Rob  Real fast  Hey what's up  Yeah how strange and funny  Do you think it would be  If like Vince McMahon  Right now is in Aruba  And he dies in a parasailing accident  I don't think they would explain that  I think it's eaten by sharks  Well he just goes missing  Yeah  That's correct  Just goes missing 
[01:56:00]  Sam  Finally  Any explanation on this  This article here  Well all their news  Is coming from that same  Goofy police department  Oh the goofy police department  That is the Wilkes-Barre  The Keystone Cops  Exactly  They're not that far away  Why don't we have them  The goofy police department  Come in here  And you can tell them to their face  Yeah  Well I mean I have a lot of things  To get done on a daily basis  Ah you're a busy man  I don't have  And you have  Complete faith  In the  Daniel Beck  Oh yeah  Who is the lead investigator  With the FIC 
[01:56:30]  Who has been questioning people  At the event  Oh yeah  Instead of  And did the cameras  Kind of show him  Questioning people  Yes  So we all knew  He's questioning people  You don't think it's weird  That Bob Costas  Would actually trash  Vince McMahon  After he got blown up  No  A guy as middle of the road  Is Bob Costas  It was right before  That's why it's suspicious  So it's suspicious  All these people  Were saying these  Mean nasty things  Everyone's a suspect  Yeah  You know  You  The way you're kind of 
[01:57:00]  Selling this story  Like this  I'm almost thinking  You're a little too  Suspicious  In the way you're  Going about this  He's a little too  Broken up about it  Yeah yeah  He's too broken up  He's too willing to  Go along with the  Investigator and stuff  You're like the guy  That was with Columbo  All the time  No  He's like  Lieutenant it's an easy solution  Yeah  I can't understand  How he got into the limousine  Scott  And it blew up  What  Mr. Columbo  It's easy  Lieutenant  There was obviously 
[01:57:30]  A leak in the gas line  Why didn't I see that  Of course  It's like  They always kind of  You seem like that guy  No it's just  Vince McMahon  Meant a lot to me  You know  I'll get him a tissue  God damn  He's tearing up  And I just want  There to be somebody  Because other media outlets  Are completely disrespecting  The whole event  Just because of  Other things that maybe  The D.A.W.E.  Has done in the past  Okay  That maybe haven't been  Real  Quote unquote  Quote unquote 
[01:58:00]  It's either real or not  Right  Quote unquote  And there should be  A voice  If we're going to talk about it  You know what I mean  Somebody there to say  You know  I'm mourning with you  I think Sam  He's just being  A genuine guy  Sam what was your  Brain food last night  Oh right  It's the diet of an  Eight year old  He eats like an  Eight year old boy  What did you eat last night  Well I had a  A little combo platter  Some mini fish sticks  With pizza rolls  Last night  What a  He eats like he's  Eight  We learned that his  Diet is of an  Eight year old  And a big glass of

[02:02:00]  Jess  She's a very very lovely girl  Yes  We all went out to dinner  About a month ago  And this is where  I discovered Sam's  Eight year old diet  Because Jess kind of  Blew up his spot  In front of everybody  And started telling everyone  What Sam eats  What can I say  It's entirely limited  Yeah now  Do you have to  Kind of eat like this  Or  Say one more time  Do you have to eat  Like he eats  With this  Eight year old's food  Oh I know  It's totally impossible  You can see what 
[02:02:30]  It's basically  Unfreezing stuff  Every day  He likes  He likes  You know  Like lots of  May foods  Like mini fish sticks  Mini pizza rolls  Mini bagel bites  He likes those  Like Elio's pizza  But only the square kind  Is that  Ew  Is that what you envisioned  In your dream guy  When you were younger  Some guy who eats  Cheez-Its  I have a cook  Who could cook me  Lovely things  And instead  I just end up  Unfreezing stuff  Every night  Wait wait wait  Unfreezing and throwing  In a microwave right  Why only the 
[02:03:00]  Square kind of Elio's  I haven't a clue  But he really doesn't  Like the round ones  No  We have an entire  Freezer full of them  See because he has  The diet of an  Eight year old  It doesn't make sense  Anyone that has  An eight year old  Out there  This is the crap  They have to deal with  The square ones  Are the ones  They gave you in school  Right  But if you give an eight year old  Like the round ones  Even though it tastes  Like the square ones  They can go no  And throw a tantrum  Like I'm sure Sam does  I know  I made him corn last night  And he wouldn't eat it  Of course  He doesn't eat vegetables  He doesn't eat vegetables  Because it was too much

[02:05:00]  It's totally disgusting  And then a hostess cupcake  A hostess cupcake  That is the sweetest thing  I know whether to hug Sam  Or just stab him  Jess  Jess tell the guys  About his desserts  Oh look  They're also  Entirely limited  He likes Twinkies  He likes  Post-its cupcakes  He likes ice pops  But he only likes  The Flintstones push-up pops  Or if I have an ice pop  He'll have half of it  He never wants a whole one  How about Suzy Q's  Does he still eat those?  Yeah 
[02:05:30]  Are you kidding?  He likes the Flintstones push-up pops  But only half of one?  Oh well  He'll eat the whole one of those  But like if I get like a fruit bar  He'll only have a bite of mine  He won't eat his own  The same thing with fruit  He doesn't like his own fruit  He only has mine  Sam why?  Why is that?  I don't like a whole  Some foods I don't eat the whole thing  I only want some  I don't want to start a new thing  I don't want to start an apple  Start an apple?  I don't want to start 
[02:06:00]  It's not like I'll roast turkey  An apple costs 15 cents  It's not a theory in physics  That you're going to be married to  For the next five years  It's just an apple  He's scared to add other foods  To his diet I think  I'm not scared  You want just the limited things  That you want to eat  But don't you understand  Maybe she wants a whole apple  She can have a whole apple  If she wants  She could say  No you can't have any of my apple  And then I won't have any apple  So Jess you don't go out to dinner  With Sam really  There's no point  That's got to be embarrassing  We can go to family restaurants 
[02:06:30]  That's really good  Yeah you can't go to  Like a nice fancy restaurant right?  You can go to Pizzeria Uno's  All the time  Yeah yeah yeah  It's like a standing date  A standing date  At what Pizzeria Uno?  It's just  What is  You know he has his own booth there  Yeah  That's true  We would like to seat you Mr. Sam  I care  What's Sam's favorite meal?  His favorite food you said?  Yeah well his favorite meal  Let's say it's Sam's birthday 
[02:07:00]  Yeah  Oh well for Sam's birthday  His mom will make him fried chicken  And corn on the cob  And cornbread  She's a really awesome cook  But she makes everything that he likes  So it's like impossible  Like if I was to make him something for his birthday  We would probably have like Elio's  Or something like that  Elio's pizza  That would be what he would want  If you were cooking for him  Oh absolutely  I also don't do all that much cooking  So I'd be  Oh you know what he  You know his delicacy?  Ah  Chicken tacos  He'll make them 
[02:07:30]  Oh  You'll make chicken tacos?  Oh yeah  Now how  Where do you get the chicken?  From the store  It's just a regular  From the store  Just chicken  He made it for me for Valentine's Day  Just a regular chicken  Wait a minute  Chicken breast  Chicken breast  And then you cut it up and everything?  Yeah  So you're actually cooking something?  Yeah  I will cook that  I learned that in college  Cook that  You learned that in college  In college  Yeah  I bought chicken breast  And then cut them up  For Valentine's Day  Did she just say  That you made her chicken tacos?  That's what she said  Yeah  That's really romantic  Hey Jess  Tell everybody about Sam's old girlfriend 
[02:08:00]  He's depressing  His old girlfriend?  Well Sam likes a particular type of girl  Oh well I'm his first white girlfriend  Are you really?  Are they all Spanish girls or Asian?  All of the above  Black and Asian  Oh you mixed it up  Well I dated one Chinese girl  Other than that  It was black girls  You only dated black girls  Yeah  Did they break up with you  Because of your diet?  They did  Let me tell you something about Sam  Sam is all cock 
[02:08:30]  I have  This is how I know this  Yeah  Go ahead Jimmy  I know Sam  Is packing a lot  Because his girlfriend's really hot  And I saw them together  I'm like  She is a really pretty girl  Yeah you're beautiful Jess  Sam is not a bad looking guy  But he is a lanky disaster  I mean when all is said and done  I'm like he has got to have something  And that's what it is  You know what kind of confidence you need to have to date black girls?  True  As a white guy  That's what I'm thinking  You really have to be confident 
[02:09:00]  And you  Wow  Is this something like  How old were you when you dated your first black girl?  High school  17  About 17?  Yeah  Don't be surprised  And what was it?  Was it something like  You've walked up  Did you  How did you initiate it?  Did you all of a sudden go  Hey I kind of want to go out with a black girl?  No  He's never asked a girl out  No?  He's never asked a girl out  They approached him  Yeah  Yeah?  Come on man 
[02:09:30]  Are you a friend  Are you a friendly with the black community in your school?  Sure  All communities  But wait like  He's great  How do they approach you?  What do you just stand there  In something that shows off your hog  Like a pair of white spandex bike shorts  With an I'm single shirt  With some ho-hos under your arm  How did you meet Sam and like ask him out?  How did you do it?  Me?  Yeah  Oh I didn't ask Sam out 
[02:10:00]  Jess was the one girl who I went after  Oh  You guys got a future then  But the black chicks came after you?  Yeah  I was completely  Wow that is something  I'm trying to think  Al Dukes is bored  Alright it's over Johnny  Mother  It's over Johnny  I am watching Fox 5  Which is New York  And who did I just see sit down waiting to be interviewed?  Sir  Ben  Kingsley  Ben Kingsley  Release the hounds 
[02:10:30]  Pests  Release the hounds  He could have come in earlier by the way  We are boycotting his movie  He could have come in  What is he scared of?  We're talking about a guy's 8 year old freaking diet over here  He might just be his publicist  42 West  No  I'm blaming it on him  Here he is when asked if he wants to do our show  And this is really Ben Kingsley's voice  No  No no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no  You're that or it's Sam turning down food 
[02:11:00]  Wait a minute  It's either him or his  Because it's 9 o'clock  They knew he was going on at 5 to 9  And he could have easily come in here at 7 a.m. or 7.15 and made it over there.  Don't make excuses for Ben Kingsley.  It's either him or his publicist.  I'm not going to say – he may not even know he was booked on this show.  He knew he was booked.  They give him his schedule a day in advance.  I know Ben Kingsley's –  You don't have time to have a schedule.  Sir Ben Kingsley – he was putting his armor on or taking it off, I'm sure. 
[02:11:30]  When I'm on the road doing press, when I'm doing local stuff for cars,  they don't tell me where I'm going until we're in the car.  Really?  Yeah, man.  A lot of times you don't know unless you ask in advance.  Did you actually try to compare your scheduling to Oscar winner Ben Kingsley for a second?  Let me get my head on straight for a second.  You compared your scheduling and your people with Ben Kingsley.  Jim, what was the media like when you did the boxcar? 
[02:12:00]  Well, that's the point.  Here's what I don't like.  Burr felt so happy to say that.  He eased up and rested his elbow before he fired it up at me.  He knew he had a doozy.  He got comfy.  No, no, no.  What I'm saying is –  It's the interrogation.  That's kind of the point that I'm making.  He was Barry Barnes and he saw that Tim Wakefield pitch coming in.  Oh, this thing.  Knuckleball.  This stupid knuckleball.  The point I'm making is even as zero as myself, if I am not checking schedule or finding out,  a guy on that level probably does not know his day-to-day unless he inquires. 
[02:12:30]  I think he's backing out of it.  I think he was comparing himself.  Backing out of it.  Well, here's the lie.  Let me tell you the lie.  Ben Kingsley – here's what we heard yesterday.  We were in the middle of doing a promo saying Ben Kingsley is going to be on this show tomorrow,  which we did yesterday.  That's your girlfriend, by the way.  And who?  Right there.  Is it really?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, it is.  Oh, my God.  I remember her.  What's she doing on CW11?  All right, let's go.  Yeah.  And –  Look at you.  Jim, let's go.  She models.  Is that what she – I thought she was –  Well, they said what she's doing, so it's – 
[02:13:00]  We heard Ben Kingsley was – couldn't make it to our show because he was filming in Canada.  Well, let's look at Canada here, which happens to also have Fox 5,  because that's the Channel 5 – that's the Fox affiliate, local affiliate here in New York City, is Channel 5.  I just want to see, before we go to Roland, they're running through clips of his movie,  which you shan't go out and see, and I want to see them come back to the studio  and see that he is in New York. 
[02:13:30]  Of course he is.  We got Roland sitting on the couch.  We're running out of show here, Roland.  Damn it.  42 West is his publisher.  Nobody knows who they are.  Roland, what happened?  Do us a favor.  Do not see the new Ben Kingsley movie.  It works both ways.  Publicist, not publisher.  Yeah, I was just told that his schedule changed, and I told her –  Do you openly tell these people you're lying to me, and I'm in the business with you?  Why are you lying to me?  Why don't you give me the real reason why he's not on O.P. and Anthony?  I asked.  I go – his schedule changed, his ties.  So I said, okay, from 6 to 11 a.m., there's your new window. 
[02:14:00]  Whatever time, come on in.  And then I got an email or a call last night saying it's too hard.  It's too packed, his schedule.  But it's not.  He did nothing.  No.  We did a press junket.  Hey, Roland.  We could have stopped in here for 10 minutes.  At that point, you go, you're still lying to me.  What about the filming in Canada?  Well, his schedule changed again, and he's filming tomorrow.  This is such crap.  And you said, you're still lying to me. 
[02:14:30]  Yeah, I said, okay.  I said, since his schedule changed, and he's here, 6 to 11, 15 a.m. is your new window.  I just said, liar, liar, pants on fire.  Why can't he come right here from there?  How good is Danny?  Ready for this?  Yeah.  Hello?  Also, Sir Ben Kingsley transforming himself yet again for his latest film role, why he  was drawn to the quirky project and the new job he had on set.  He'll join us here live as well.  There it is.  Live as well.  Live.  Right there.  There he is.  Um, yeah. 
[02:15:00]  Oh, you son of a bitch.  He didn't have to choose between one or the other.  He could have come in and given us a quick 12, 15 minute thing if he had to do Fox.  Well, that's what I said.  I said, if worse comes to worse, I go, from 6 a.m., 6.30, 7, whatever time.  So let me know what time, and I'll make it happen.  And they said, uh, his schedule's due.  I'm so sick of that crap.  Schedule.  And you have to say, Roland, you're lying to me.  The guys would rather hear the real reason instead of this crap.  They've been doing this way too long to listen to these fake excuses.  Ben Kingsley want to go to war? 
[02:15:30]  We go to war.  We're going to war with Ben Kingsley.  Everybody.  It's either him or his publicist.  Ah, both of them.  All of them.  They're all in cahoots.  Why are you getting scared, Roland?  They've got to tell us the truth.  I don't give a crap who they represent.  We're not mad at you.  We're not mad at you.  We don't give a crap who they represent.  We don't want to be lied to ever.  Liars.  And they're screwed up the schedule.  You're a liar.  I would respect them if they said, look, it's not his cup of tea.  It's not his type of show.  Whatever. 
[02:16:00]  I'd rather hear that than this, oh, he's filming in Canada.  He flew in for an hour and he's going back to Canada.  Be honest.  Promoting this dope for two weeks and they screw us up by the day before.  Exactly.  We promoted that for two weeks and then they pull out at the last minute like that.  Yes.  Stop it.  No Elio's pizza.  Right.  And please don't help the box office for his movie this weekend.  Please, please, please don't.  If you know someone that has it, get it from them.  If you really need to see it, wait for the second or third week because, you know, the 
[02:16:30]  first week is what matters for all these jerks.  Go online.  Download it.  All right.  We got to go.  Sam's girlfriend.  Thank you.  Sorry we interrupted your fine phone call here.  Yeah, sorry.  It's my pleasure.  My pleasure, guys.  Have a good one.  Nice talking to you.  All right.  We'll have you back to talk about Sam's ex-girlfriends because I'm sure there's some stories there.  Yeah, baby.  It's just everyone, Sam.  Good job today.  Bill Burr, Comedy Connection.  Boston.  Yep.  At the end of the month, billburr.com for that info.  Go to break.com today.  We are helping them pick the videos today for the front page.  That's pretty cool.  We have teamed up with break.com, so do that as well. 
[02:17:00]  Okay.  Life benefits is lotioning.  Yeah.  More Ben Kingsley talk coming up on the other side.  Yes.  More sanity.  Yes, profanity-laced tirades next.  Go.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The virus is spreading. 
[02:17:30]  More problems.  I was ready to go.  Ooh, what'd you say?  More problems.  It's a motherfucker.  This radio thing just sucks.  We solved the problems with this company, and now we got new problems with the other company.  It just never ends.  Break.com has been a great friend of the show, and we partnered with Break.com today.  They allowed us to pick the videos to be on the front page. 
[02:18:00]  It's pretty cool.  The front page of Break.com gets at least a million hits a day, and it has our logo, which  is great for branding.  And we picked the videos that we thought would be cool to check out today, right on the front  page.  All show-related.  Most people don't go past the front page on a video site.  And then they also allowed us to have a couple of our videos featured on the front page.  That is a huge promotion for the Opie and Anthony Show.  And Tom Chiasano at the other joint started dumping out of the plugs at the end of the 
[02:18:30]  show.  They weren't getting paid on them.  Yeah.  Like, he doesn't understand the overall picture with this whole thing.  See, the big picture is we give them a little publicity.  They give us a lot of publicity because it's our show being plugged.  And then people tune in.  They go, hey, who is this?  Wow, that's kind of cool.  Opie and Anthony did this.  They watch the video and find out where we're available.  And the station does better.  When the station does better, it makes more money because the ratings are up. 
[02:19:00]  Like, they never look beyond the dollar that's dangling in front of their face.  There's so many people out there still don't understand the Internet.  They really don't.  They don't get it.  They don't get how it works.  They look at it like it's like another TV station.  The Internet.  The Internet.  Well, how many people view Break.com on a daily basis?  Can you find out?  They would know that answer in a second.  There's got to be one, two hundred people a day.  I would guess.  They don't get the effect of it. 
[02:19:30]  They don't understand the value of it where they look at like they're giving because they're  so fucking pompous.  We're giving away a plug.  You're also getting one on a fucking major website that a lot more people go to than  hear the radio show.  They don't even think that.  Of course they don't.  They're thinking like they did ten years ago.  And yet the rules you have to play by on terrestrial radio are not the same.  Right.  All right.  What Howard was able to do is have girls doing things for plugs.  Meanwhile, we can't plug opanthony.com because there might be fucking tits on it. 
[02:20:00]  Right.  Meanwhile, hardcore porno sluts are showing fucking clam.  Holy shit.  And you're able to plug those sites.  You can't anymore.  I mean, you can't anymore.  No, no.  Terrestrial radio has no idea.  I know where this comes from, by the way.  I think.  I've heard commercials for another video site on that side of the show.  I don't even remember the actual website.  Yeah. 
[02:20:30]  So I think that's where the problem is.  Oh, this video site.  Is it a competitor or something?  This video site paid for actual commercials that I've heard during our show, and we just  gave a free plug to break.com.  Well, tough shit.  We've had a relationship with these guys for a long time.  And this is where Tom is now hurting us personally.  You know, when we're not even talking about break.com, but there's a cool video that happened  on our show, they have no problem putting it on the front page to help us out a little  bit.  Yeah.  That is going to go away if we don't, you know, help each other out. 
[02:21:00]  How many people view break.com a day?  Hundreds of thousands, if not over a million people.  If not over a million people.  Are there more people who do hear the radio show?  I would think it's more like a million people.  I'd have to check their rankings.  I can get an answer for you in a couple minutes.  Do you know how many?  What they don't get is when you've got a fucking TV show, people can watch the TV show  and come to the radio show.  We don't have a fucking television show.  Maybe we don't deserve one.  Okay.  But when you have the internet now and you can use that to get people to the radio show, 
[02:21:30]  what don't people in radio understand about that?  Yeah.  I don't understand how they don't fuck.  Meanwhile, if some shit goes up on the Drudge Report, they all understand it.  Oh, that they understand.  I mean anything.  It could be anything on Drudge.  They understand immediately the power of how fucking many people go see that.  But yet when it's something like this, they just don't get it because they're all thinking  like it's fucking 1985 and they wonder why people are running away from terrestrial radio.  So I wonder why. 
[02:22:00]  What bothers me the most is that he doesn't even come in here and tell us that it's a problem.  That was a big, huge deal that was going on today with us on Break.com.  Well, I think he won't come in during the show to throw something like that at us.  And we've been promoting Break.com since we started back on regular radio.  He knows not to come in during the show.  So this wasn't a curveball.  It wasn't one of Tim Wakefield's awful knuckleballs that went into the stands and hit a kid in the head.  This was like, you know, this is pretty much business as usual as far as our show goes. 
[02:22:30]  Tens of hundreds, if not a thousand.  It could be in the ones or the five billions.  I'll check in the teens.  He said then, then he goes, I'll check, which means what he said, he had no clue.  He just threw that out without even a clue.  Just admit it.  He goes, hundreds of thousands.  Hundreds of thousands.  Maybe that's too low.  If not millions.  One million.  It's 1.3 million. 
[02:23:00]  How much is that house that you're selling?  Hundreds of thousands, if not millions.  If not millions.  Do we have a deal?  I love Steve.  Is it really 1.3 million a day?  Yeah.  How many eyebrows did you cut off?  Hundreds of thousands, if not millions.  1.3 million a day.  Could go see any video we put up, which gets people to the radio show.  Why would you want someone to do that?  Yeah, I don't get it.  Why would you want them to go, oh, 1.3 million people to go on the homepage when you... 
[02:23:30]  Yeah, because then more people would listen and you'd make more money.  Yeah, why would you want that?  Yeah, that's stupid.  Get the extra fucking X amount of dollars for a plug.  Yeah.  Ugh.  Well, I guess we're going to have to have a chat about that.  But it's almost like, it's not like you're giving away something for free.  No.  It's self-defeating.  It's like, do you not...  I don't care.  Quid pro quo, Mr. Chiasano.  Exactly.  You will let me know when those braces stop tightening.  Oh, God damn. 
[02:24:00]  Oh, Ope's making a call.  Look out.  Who are you calling?  He's got his game face on, too.  Calling for pizza.  Helios, the square ones.  By the way, clam is what I think is the most repulsive word.  For vagina.  Yeah.  Oh, absolutely.  I just think low tide, you're smelling fish.  Clam.  That has to be the worst.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Gash.  You know what's...  I'll tell you one.  Degrading...  What?  Smelly Mr. Red Lips. 
[02:24:30]  You know what?  I heard somebody actually call a girl once.  It's like, so this fucking slit is going to tell me.  It's like, that goes hand in hand with just punching somebody in the face.  That is really bad.  But I laughed when I heard it.  I'm like, God, that is nasty.  That makes you, yeah, yeah, abs tighten.  Yeah.  Slit.  You think this fucking slit is going to tell me what the fuck to do?  Fuck her.  In Q&A, there's a thing where he goes, you want something for you and your quiff. 
[02:25:00]  Your quiff.  Slit, man.  That's a good one.  Gash.  That's another one.  Slit.  Any of those.  Gash.  I've heard so much, it kind of wore itself out.  Gash.  Clam.  Clam.  It's just...  Because it smells bad.  Oh, it just sounds whiny and...  It sounds useless.  It really does.  Well, kind of plump.  A little plump and sticky, gooey.  That awful paper, that see-through paper that they have around a clam roll. 
[02:25:30]  Yeah.  It's somehow beholding that.  You even say that when your hands, oh, they're a little clammy today.  It just doesn't conjure up something nice.  Yeah.  Yeah, then there are the goofy ones like fur burger or hair pie.  That's like trying to be silly.  Yeah.  I don't like those.  I always find that those are people who weren't getting any.  Yeah, that's always people that aren't.  Did you see a fur burger?  And then they'd high five afterwards.  You're not getting anything.  The exclamation point that you're still just rubbing your dick raw. 
[02:26:00]  Cunny.  Yeah, people.  Oh, cunny is what fucking pedophiles say in England or whatever.  Really?  That's a creepy little cunny.  Yeah.  I didn't know that.  I just thought it was a different word for cunt.  Speaking of cunny, that fucking Ben Kingsley is really annoying me.  Serpent Kingsley?  Serpent Kingsley?  Yeah, he's showing his mug on local TV here in New York City where we're broadcasting from. 
[02:26:30]  And yet said he couldn't make it on our program.  And meanwhile, that dummy, this show replays all day here on XM.  That would have been heard in two countries.  Yeah.  Four other times.  What a dumb mother for his stupid movie.  Well, he's been knighted, so.  Yeah, once you become a sir.  When are they going to stop playing Make-Believe over there in England?  It's fucking ridiculous.  Make-Believe.  Yeah.  Oh, how true.  I was talking about who is, like I said, I wanted a list of everyone who's been knighted  and just see how stupid it is. 
[02:27:00]  Because, like, isn't Elton John a knight?  Yeah.  He is.  Sir Elton John?  Let's look at that army of actors.  Yeah.  That they're going to give swords to.  That they're going to give swords and put armor on to protect the Queen's realm.  McCartney is going to swing his wife's prosthetic.  It's just playing Make-Believe.  What year is it?  Stop.  It's not 1500.  Alec Baldwin I would follow into battle.  Would you?  Yeah.  Sir Alec Baldwin.  Yeah, he doesn't have actor energy. 
[02:27:30]  That guy has, like, older brother.  Yeah.  My shoulder gets sore every time I see him.  I just picture walking past him in a hallway and he just punches you for no reason.  Probably hard to be his younger brother, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  He's a bastard.  I used to do a bit about that guy going, he was so talented, all his brothers made it  too.  Yeah, he dragged them all along with him.  He went through that phase, though, where he was kind of like an actor that was trying  to be the good-looking actor guy.  I think that that's what they were offering.  Like a George Clooney kind of guy. 
[02:28:00]  And it worked for a while.  And then he fell off the face of the earth, got kind of fat, and came back.  And everyone was fine with him being a little fat and gruff now.  He wasn't like the nice guy.  Because I think he was always a character actor, but he looked like a movie star.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  The rare combination, Anthony.  He plays a great prick now.  Matinee, idol, good looks, whatever the other hacky things that people say.  He plays probably the best prick I've ever heard.  As a matter of fact, we got a clip from one of his movies here. 
[02:28:30]  Oh, that guy's hilarious.  That I just love.  Oh, God.  I sure hope I could find it.  He's hilarious, and I think he's a good father.  We're excited about that.  Yes, exactly.  My dad would have dropped the F-bomb at least 58 times if I ever did that.  If I ever insulted him with the phone.  Is that on the clean box or the dirty box?  It should be on both boxes.  It should be.  Dirty box, another one women hate.  Dirty box.  Especially when you refer to her as that in front of her.  Like, yeah, well, the dirty box was putting her makeup on. 
[02:29:00]  Oh, here he is.  Everything was great until the dirty box over here.  It's just a catastrophe.  It's not even on.  Look at the fan running back and forth.  I don't know.  That better be the president of the fucking United States on the phone.  I've made an ass of myself.  Talk to your daughter.  I've made an ass of myself.  He didn't drop the F-bomb.  Not at all.  He didn't curse.  Not at all.  My dad would have just...  Listen, you...  Yeah.  How kids get away with anything.  Kids don't seem to be afraid of their parents anymore. 
[02:29:30]  Like, I was fucking petrified of my father.  Oh, yeah.  They just had this...  And now you see kids, like, they're like, go fuck yourself to, like, their father.  I would have...  I said, damn once and just got a smack across the face.  You grew up in the era where, like, the neighbor's parents could slap you around, right?  You had that full power of attorney to just smack you in the face if you mouthed off. 
[02:30:00]  And no matter what they did, your parents always believed them.  Back to them.  Because they were fellow adults.  When did that switch?  Yeah, that...  All of a sudden...  Well, when they started fucking the kids, maybe that was a problem because...  Yeah, but were they doing that back then?  Nah, I don't think so.  I don't think...  I was a cute...  I was an adorable child.  And I walked the streets alone.  Dude, I used to get up...  No one touched me.  Someone did.  Do you think?  Yeah, somebody...  I blocked it out.  Somebody snuck in there.  I had tussleable hair.  Wonderful.  I used to get up six in the morning and do a paper route. 
[02:30:30]  I'm dressed as a paper boy.  Then that has to be a fetish of some sort for a pedophile.  Riding up hills.  Little Billy Burr.  Yeah.  Standing up.  Ass in the air.  Nothing ever happened.  No.  It wasn't...  It was like you heard about these creeps, but it was never big on the news or anything.  It wasn't in your neighborhood.  I actually have a theory on this.  I think that with all the porn and how far you actually can go on the internet is actually... 
[02:31:00]  It's sort of like drawing...  Are you saying stepping stone?  It's like an easier...  It's enabling...  It gets you closer to that final thing.  I sound like a conservative here, huh?  You really do.  You sound like people that want to do away with the internet.  I see what you're saying, though.  It's very hard to go from A to Z.  Z being, you know, molestation.  And A being perusing some Playboy magazine, let's say.  Neither one of us has any sort of psychology degree.  No, no.  But I have a microphone.  Exactly.  So I know everything. 
[02:31:30]  Let's go with this.  Yeah.  So now the internet brings you further down the line where you're able to see a lot more.  And to make that final jump off to where you actually are doing a criminal activity, sexual crime, it's easier?  Is that what you're saying?  Well, I don't understand how that show, To Catch a Predator, I don't understand how that's not entrapment.  Because I know you can't be like, hey, you want some drugs?  You can't do that.  But you can be like, oh my God, I'm a 12-year-old.  I'm a second cat.  A tee-hee-hee.  How do you type like a 12-year-old? 
[02:32:00]  I'm Chris Hansen with Dateline NBC.  Take a seat.  Have some lemonade.  Oh, I didn't.  Because they always say, yeah, she said she was 20 and then they pull out the transcripts.  Even intent, right?  Even like intent.  Yeah.  If you intend on meeting up with an underage person for sexual activity, it doesn't matter if they were or weren't.  You're guilty.  All I know is that because of the access to the internet, I ended up seeing stuff that I would never go rent. 
[02:32:30]  I would never go look at.  You're just there.  You're just clicking.  And then the stuff that just sort of starts popping up like that whole, well, if you clicked on this, you must be into this.  And you start trying to get all the X's to shut it off.  Well, that's it.  I think the internet itself draws you in further than you want to go into a certain subject.  Because you'll click on something very innocent.  Like one of the video sites, you'll be up there popping away, break.com, whatever it is.  And then you'll hit another link and another link.  And before you know it, you're just into this wretched, hardcore, disgusting. 
[02:33:00]  Like I was sitting there at the computer the other day and my girlfriend goes, you got to look at this.  And I go, all right.  I come over.  There's a guy fucking himself in the ass with his own dick.  What was that?  Lucky devil.  He was able to take a semi-hard one and push it down into his ass and push with his hand to where he actually penetrated himself.  Can we see that?  Until he came. 
[02:33:30]  Now can we not?  And I was watching it fascinated.  And then it's a freak show.  Then I had to ask, how the fuck did you even get here?  Like how did you arrive on that site?  I bet she was probably looking at good genes.  Stuff about sea turtles.  It could have been right.  If you arrive on that and all of a sudden see a turtle get fucked by a guy, all of a sudden that like pops up.  You know, or seahorses.  You know, seahorses, the male actually carries the eggs after a while. 
[02:34:00]  And then it goes into something of a guy fucking himself.  Yeah, see a horse get fucked.  Somehow it goes from some learning something about biology.  Seahorse-cocked man fuck himself.  And Bill, I don't believe that you were molested.  I think what happened was the pedophiles saw you and you were so beautiful with that red hair and so sult, they thought you were a setup.  So there's no way.  This is just roaming around.  This is a work of art.  My Norman Rockwell fantasy.  This fucking appley-cheeked boy. 
[02:34:30]  What did I miss?  I had everything but the baseball mitt.  A little bit of everything.  Yeah.  You should be on a policeman's desk eating ice cream with the cop hat on sideways.  That's where little Billy belonged.  The painting Rockwell never did, which is just you fucking crying and repressing things.  Like, they show like a man behind you and fucking blood trickling down your calf.  Oh, Christ.  But in your head, it's cotton candy at a circus.  Young Bill Burr. 
[02:35:00]  Baseball.  Norman loved baseball.  Yeah.  Baseball game.  What did I miss?  What did I miss?  The show.  I'm in the back of the studio fighting for the show.  I've missed a lot of things.  We ran through about eight to nine subjects.  All right.  We were talking about the internet.  I try to stay away from porn.  I don't think it's good for you.  Porn?  Yeah.  Just fuck with me.  Are you being truthful?  You really don't.  Why does it fuck with you?  I just don't think it's like, it just keeps desensitizing you.  I just don't dig on porn.  Yeah. 
[02:35:30]  I'm just not into this shit.  I'd rather, I don't know, use your brain.  Learn stuff?  No, you'd rather use your brain and then try to fucking make it happen in real life.  Ah, okay.  Rather than being just sitting there hunched over in that awful, like, osteoporosis.  I don't look at as much porn as I did when the internet first really took off.  Because it was nothing but porn.  That I would, I would just peruse pornography constantly.  Now I find myself reading, like, news sites and blogs and things. 
[02:36:00]  And then, you know, of course, I'll fall into it after a while.  Yeah, but you got to do that just in case the FBI comes in and takes your hard drive.  So you can be like, oh, it was a phase.  Yeah, yeah.  Look at all this other stuff.  Could you imagine, like, getting in trouble for something you downloaded eight years ago or something?  They just busted a whole fucking, 700 people worldwide they just arrested.  Yeah.  And some giant, I'm sure there are guys that are posting, but they just busted a whole bunch of guys in the past thing.  For what?  Kiddie porn.  For what?  For what? 
[02:36:30]  For what?  Yeah, but it's, oof.  Why is, why are we having a lot of dad calls, by the way?  Really?  Yeah.  You're not already a dad?  Oh, you know, I was saying, I was petrified of my father growing up.  And kids today kind of, like, just, they'll curse their fathers out.  They'll fuck yourself.  They won't listen to him.  Like, my father was the law.  That what he said, and it didn't matter what the fuck it was, you know, go outside and rake the leaves.  Mow the fucking lawn.  Wash the car.  It was always like he would just, he'd fuck my mother and make little workers. 
[02:37:00]  That's like what parents did back then.  It was like, I don't want to fucking wash my car.  Come here.  I'm going to get you pregnant and make a car wash and a fucking rake guy and a fucking lawnmower.  Blame the do-gooders.  They took the spanking away from the parents.  Well, that's what we were talking about.  That was the ultimate threat.  How parents used to, other parents, they would back, they delegate responsibility to their  neighbors to fucking hit you if you mowed off also.  I see my brothers and sisters, they have kids, and they give the timeouts. 
[02:37:30]  I'm like, what?  Timeout?  I would have laughed at a timeout.  I'm not making fun of my brothers and sisters.  This is how parents raise kids now.  That's the norm.  It's like, what does a timeout really do?  I would have laughed at a timeout.  Remember the crap that we used to get?  Nothing beat that spontaneous smack across the face.  An open hand smack.  Pop knew when to close his hand or to open it.  Right.  And, you know, if it was just a wise-ass remark or something, that would come out of nowhere  where you would be like, boo, your ears would ring.  You'd go, what the fuck? 
[02:38:00]  Where did that come?  And then you'd just, you'd like, it was like, you ever see Saving Private Ryan when the shell  went off and the lieutenant, like, went deaf for a little while?  Yeah, yeah.  And they're yelling at him, but he's just seeing them yelling and he's, meow, meow, meow.  So you'd get a smack and then look, and your father's just yelling at you, but you're  hearing, boo, and then we'd come in slow, boo, I gotta hear that fucking language again  out of you.  Do what I say. 
[02:38:30]  Yeah, do as I say, not as I do.  You make a really good point.  He knew when to have an open hand.  Oh, yeah.  Very rare with the closed fist.  Very rare.  I got the closed fist once, light.  He knew to pull the punch, too.  Right, right.  Oh, dad loved me.  He knew when to pull the punch.  We got hit with wooden spoons, hot wheel track.  My mom was a prop hack when it came to a hack prop hack.  My mom was the carrot top of beatings, but she would always pull out props.  But they just knew how hard to go.  Dad had one prop, no belt. 
[02:39:00]  Now it's a timeout in a corner.  Doesn't work.  My father would put me in a figure four leg like Greg Valentine, the leg locks.  Greg Valentine.  Greg the hammer, and then we'd just laugh at how homoerotic it looked.  My dad never hit me.  Never hit you?  My mother was brutal, though.  Really?  Yeah.  Four brothers.  So my dad was in a fraternity, and he saved the paddle.  So she used to use that on us.  We used to hide that thing.  But the thing was, she used to line us up, and you'd be standing there waiting like, 
[02:39:30]  oh, God.  Maybe she'll be tired by the time she gets down to me.  In California, my father was so irresponsible with feeding children, things like that.  I was in my early teens, but I wasn't supposed to be going out and fending for myself at that  point in life.  And there were certain days I was starving.  I was a kid starving, you know?  So I went in to look for change that was laying around.  And I opened up his wife's jewelry box, and I found these quarters in there. 
[02:40:00]  They were these silver quarters that were, like, real old.  What did you get for a quarter in 1927?  Way back, I would go to the pop stand.  I would go to the drugstore, and the soda jerk would...  Catch a double feature and get a shake.  I would actually go to Thrifty Drug and Discount Store out in California, right next to the  Vons, and I would get some ice cream sandwiches.  I would get a box of ice cream sandwiches and sit behind the store and eat an entire box  of ice cream sandwiches because I was fucking starving. 
[02:40:30]  So I get in the truck one night, and my father goes, uh, did you take anything from our bedroom?  And I'm like, um, of course I lie.  No.  Uh, you didn't go into the jewelry box and take any quarters?  Uh, yeah.  I took them.  Look, I went, bam, bam, bam, right in the side of the head.  I'm like, oh, fuck.  I didn't even get an excuse out.  How many quarters were in there that they noticed?  Wasn't it $10,000 worth in quarters? 
[02:41:00]  How much did a box of ice cream sandwiches cost back then?  It had to be like the exact amount that you needed for ice cream sandwiches.  It was probably $1.50 I took in quarters, but they was like silver quarters, so they were  probably worth more.  Like they were old quarters, collector's quarters.  Oh, the upside down.  It was just stamp.  Yeah, yeah.  The upside down plane flying, you know, one of those quarters.  Double stamp.  I never understood that collecting of money.  It's like the second you take it out of your book, it's worth a quarter.  It's worth whatever it is. 
[02:41:30]  Yeah.  Face value.  Oh, the Franklin Mint horse shit that my father falls for.  Look, they're in the plastic.  I know, stupid.  They say 2006 on them.  Yeah.  Take five of those and get some ice cream sandwiches.  I knew this was coming in.  My brother's got on timeouts.  Timeouts do nothing but give the parents a bit of peace and quiet.  Yeah, that's what a timeout's for.  They even know.  They even know.  They're like, well, at the very least, we can get a little silence in the house.  I told, to finish up that story, after the ringing went out of my ears, I had explained  to him why I took the quarters, and he, I know he believed it in his head, but he didn't 
[02:42:00]  want to, like, fess up to it.  I said, I was starving.  I bought ice cream sandwiches.  And he goes, no, you didn't.  You bought more of those goddamn model rockets.  Because I was into model rocketry.  I was a kid.  I was, like, always trying to, like, learn.  Yeah, and I bought one for $1.25.  And I bought one for $1.25, Pop.  Is that what they're going for?  I could have been, yeah, you were into model rockets.  It could have led to NASA.  You could have been one of these space shows.  I could have been an astronaut.  But, Dad, you're served by that.  But I got a slug in the face for a fucking ice cream sandwich. 
[02:42:30]  And, you know something, though?  Like I said, I know he knew I fucking bought food with that because I was starving.  And he knows I didn't eat.  Why were you starving all the time?  Because the fucking horses had to eat.  And he needed 40 of Budweiser to hang out at the stable with the Chato Reyes  and get hammered.  I'm just picturing bare feet, overalls, dirt roads.  Anthony's really opened up about his relationship with his father in the last year.  It's been very interesting.  It was just a mess out there. 
[02:43:00]  Oh.  Have you ever gone to therapy?  No.  No.  Every time I go to therapy and I try to tell the childhood stories,  I just start laughing.  As I tell them, they're just funny at this point.  And then the therapist is always just saying, they're like,  I don't think that's funny.  Why are you laughing?  I think the laughing is masking pain, which makes me laugh even more.  And I'm just like, I can't do this.  And then I leave.  I can't.  I couldn't do it.  I couldn't do it seriously.  Look, I think I know what my father's deal was. 
[02:43:30]  He didn't want to be a father.  He liked, you know, he liked the kids.  I know, like, he liked having me around.  I was fun.  You know, shit like that.  He was able to have a son.  Probably gave him a joker, too.  Yeah.  He was able to have a son who, like, would ride horses and rope and do things like that.  You know, fatherly thing.  He could, like, smack me for crying like a girl when I got a cramp in my leg.  If you ever fucking scream like that again, I want to see an arrow coming out of your chest.  He told me that once when I got a cramp in my leg and went,  I screamed and everybody looked.  What the fuck are you doing screaming like that? 
[02:44:00]  He couldn't understand.  I was like a kid in pain.  I want to go back to the Model Rockets.  Oh, yeah.  What's wrong with the Model Rockets?  Well, if I was stealing the quarters.  But he was bothered that you had this hobby to begin with.  Probably was a little too geeky for a cowboy.  Whether it was your mom buying you the Model Rockets for your birthday or whatever.  I'll tell you when the turning point was.  When my brother Joe got sent out to California because he was being a bad boy here in New York  and my mother couldn't put up with his shit anymore. 
[02:44:30]  Joe came out.  Within, I'd say, a month of my brother being out there,  he then started hiding his pot in the payload sections of my rockets.  So I found a joint once.  And I said, you know something, let me try this.  I went into a watershed.  It's this thing in the riverbed.  It's like a pump house with the big old rusty handles in there and stuff.  And it was made of tin and it was pitch black.  What is a watershed?  It's like a pump house.  It was in the riverbed.  And it was like a flood control station. 
[02:45:00]  It was like a little tin shack with a big handle on there that you turn to turn the water on somewhere.  But it was locked.  It was pitch black in there.  So I went in, smoked an entire joint.  And I heard you didn't get high the first time you smoked pot.  So I smoked the whole thing.  Oh, bad mistake.  And when I opened up the door, it was like when Dorothy opened the door on the second half of The Wizard of Oz  and it was in color.  Oh, God.  I walked out of there and looked around and saw everything in a whole new light.  I didn't give a shit about school anymore, about Model Rockets, about making anyone happy. 
[02:45:30]  I could give a flying fuck about everything except I needed more pot.  That continued through high school and everything.  Just more pot.  It continues to this day.  Are you kidding?  I don't smoke.  You just don't smoke the pot anymore.  I haven't smoked pot in fucking probably 20 years.  Dude, you know what's funny?  That's why I never – I finally tried it a couple years ago.  Really?  36, 37 years old.  I finally tried it and it was the exact reason why I never tried it because I loved it. 
[02:46:00]  I loved it.  It was the greatest feeling and I was just like, this is why I didn't do it.  But I'm old enough now to be like, okay, I know what it does.  When I jump on the couch, I'm not going to be motivated.  You're not going to do anything.  Well, that's who it was.  I'll tell you this.  If I did it at 14, 15, that would have been a 15-year habit.  I got a goal.  I'm going to start heroin at 70.  That's probably the best time to do it.  I'm serious.  Dude, you get a 70-year-old heroin addict.  You'll be shredded.  I know, man.  Shredded.  That's going to be cool. 
[02:46:30]  Nice.  My brother got caught with weed on him, though, in California.  He had the, he had, and he was being sent out there for disciplinary reasons because  he was fucking up here in New York with, living with my mom.  So my father immediately went like, all right, Joe's fucking up.  I got to be the disciplinarian.  So I'm not even going to try to fake it and be nice.  So he caught him, though.  He saw a little lump in Joe's sock when he got in the truck and says, what's that?  And Joe's like, nothing.  Let me see what that is.  Oh, look, I'm holding it for a wham! 
[02:47:00]  Pot.  He had pot on him.  And my father didn't even know.  You're carrying around like it was a little, it was probably a nickel.  Probably enough to roll maybe three joints with.  Probably why he hit him.  You're going around with an ounce of pot on you?  And you couldn't sit there and explain, no, Pop, an ounce of pot is like a lot of pot.  Then you would show your education.  But this is like a little, like an ounce you see as being, bam! 
[02:47:30]  Yeah.  I know you've told the story many times, but you're down this road.  You got to tell Bill about the, I don't want, hold on.  Yes.  Because I don't know if it's going to blow the punchline.  Oh.  Is that Urkel on TV?  Sorry.  It's all right.  Let me see.  Oh, yeah.  That was the one with my Uncle Joe.  Yeah, yeah.  Tell me about that.  My Uncle Joe.  When he was living, well, it was my mom and me, my sister and my brother living in East Islip,  wonderful suburb of Long Island, East Islip, New York. 
[02:48:00]  And I had a nice little house, lived next door to two police officers, one on either  side of us, one retired, one active.  So it was a nice neighborhood.  Boomer Esiason lived right down the road.  A bunch of kids.  We used to play on our bikes.  And my uncle was living with us for a while.  My Uncle Joe.  He was a hippie at the time and very into his pot, the connoisseur of marijuana.  He got some seeds and planted pot plants in the backyard in these huge garbage pails on 
[02:48:30]  our back patio.  And he also had a big garden with cucumbers and tomatoes and everything else in there.  Pot seeds.  Yeah, pot seeds.  He planted these plants.  They got to be about eight to 12 feet tall, varying sizes, in these huge planters where  they were towering over our hedges and everything.  So now the police.  So now we got cops living on either side of us. 
[02:49:00]  And they're just poking over the hedges, huge buds growing off the tops of these things.  They were giant.  And my uncle had told my mother it was a basil oregano hybrid that he was working on.  He had like grafted it together and he was making like 80,000 pounds of basil oregano hybrid  to sell to fucking Italians somewhere.  I don't know what his plan was, but my mother bought the whole thing.  My father comes over one weekend to pick us up. 
[02:49:30]  The divorced father pickup thing.  Wouldn't you need a lab to come up with something amazing like that?  Yeah, exactly.  He's grafting basil and oregano in his lab downstairs that constantly smelled of weed.  And so my father comes over and he goes out back and he sees these huge pot plants growing  out back.  And my mother just hated my father at that point and would not listen to a word he said,  just condescending everything.  It was like she hated just to see him to even pick us up. 
[02:50:00]  Uh, he comes to pick us up and goes, Ro, there's fucking pot plants growing out in your backyard.  And she goes, Joey, don't be an asshole.  It's basil oregano hybrid.  Oh, yeah.  And my father's just looking at her like, you ass, you dumb ass.  Do you realize they could take the kids away and everything?  You would be arrested.  This whole house would fucking go to jail.  Tell your brother to get rid of the fucking pot plants.  And all I remember after that was in his apartment, pot plants hanging everywhere, drying as quickly 
[02:50:30]  as possible.  Can you just have like one weed plant and they just go, hey, dig it up?  No, it's got to be a whole farm, a forest of pot.  I don't know.  Now, if you had one weed plant?  Yeah, if you just took one seed.  You'd get in trouble.  You're not allowed to grow it.  I'm just trying to grow a nickel bag.  You'd have a better argument.  I'm trying to just grow a nickel bag.  You'd have a better argument.  See, I didn't know somebody, I didn't put it there with only one plant.  But if you have, they're in planters and they have a sprinkler system on them. 
[02:51:00]  Oh, yeah.  He would cultivate this thing.  He was amazing.  Grew huge pot plants, basil and oregano.  Lots of instant feedback coming in.  Sam from FBA, the moment you spank a kid, they think that they can get you arrested.  I used to catch hangers, shoes, and even a water hose before.  And that leads to the next instant feedback.  Hot wheels track.  We got Brian from Buffalo.  Can you guys play the audio of the angry Boston dad driving his kid home?  Remember this?  Oh, yeah.  We haven't played this in a really long time.  That is vicious. 
[02:51:30]  What's the story?  I can't even remember.  Like, the father was supposed to pick his kid up from a dance or something.  Do you know the back story you rocked?  Yeah, you don't know.  I can tell.  Don't even try.  The kid taped it, right?  All right.  The kid taped it?  There's another part of that.  My brother used to do that.  He had a boombox with dual cassette.  And he used to tape my parents' arguments and then put music underneath it.  Are you brilliant?  Dude, it was hilarious.  The best one he ever had because the argument fit the way the music was going.  You know that Led Zeppelin song, No Quarter?  Yeah.  It starts really slowly with that haunting keyboard. 
[02:52:00]  And you just hear my dad going, oh, what the fuck?  This is some bullshit.  As he's getting madder and madder, the music is like, right as he flipped out, like, Bonham  came in with the crash cymbals.  It was great.  I actually asked him yesterday if he still had that.  He said, it's somewhere in my parents' house.  Oh, you got to find that.  That's hilarious.  I remember the last thing with my uncle over here.  He kind of lived.  It wasn't really the basement.  It was kind of like one of those split level things.  So off the kitchen, it was a few steps down, like half a floor down. 
[02:52:30]  And that was where he lived.  And we put a door up, or he put a door up, and put this, like, barely you could see through  this frosted glass by this little window that went from the kitchen into his apartment.  But there was a gap there that I could peer through and look into his apartment.  And he used to have these pot parties, you know, like a bunch of hippies.  He'd be down there, big beards, just smoking weed, topless broads and everything like that.  But I didn't know if I left the light on in the kitchen and peered through, that through  the frosted glass, he'd see my silhouette clear as day, peering in. 
[02:53:00]  So I left the light on, and I'm looking and watching, and watching this party going on.  And then out of nowhere, this lump of clay just went right in the hole I was looking at.  Just took some clay and, like, scram, kid.  But who has clay laying around for that stuff?  They were sculpting, man.  It's the 70s.  It was just so grieving, man.  Good point.  Danny, what's the back story?  It was probably hash, knowing him.  Yeah, right.  Big lump of hash.  This is the father that's yelling at the kid in the car? 
[02:53:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, he apparently had a reputation of being late.  And obviously the kid knows that the father is going to freak out, so he kind of pre-plans  this.  And I think he was purposefully late and then taped his father freaking out for a solid  three minutes, I think, at least.  Yeah, so his father came by to pick up his son.  And his son wasn't there for a while.  Yeah, he was about 15 minutes late.  So when the kid finally gets into the car, his father just unloads on him.  This is great.  As well he should have. 
[02:54:00]  The beauty of this is that you hear the snotty kid knowing, you know, he's taping the whole  thing.  I don't think his father knew he was taping.  And the kid's laughing along because he knows the father's never going to hit him.  So it's a new day and age as far as raising the kids.  I'm not getting in the car.  I'm not getting in the car.  Get the fuck in the car.  Dad.  Dad.  I'm going to look at time.  Get your ass in here.  Calm down.  It's 11.10.  It's 11.10.  What time did I fucking tell you?  11.  Get the fuck here.  Dude.  What the fuck time does it say? 
[02:54:30]  Dude.  What the fuck time is there?  It says 11 fucking 10 in there.  It's 11.21.  It says 11 fucking 10 in the car.  You think I'm fucking sitting out here for 20 minutes for your fucking ass?  Why don't you come in?  Fuck you.  You tell me 11 o'clock, you fucking cunt.  Don't waste my fucking time again.  You don't even give a shit.  It's a fucking joke to you, right?  I didn't think you were here yet.  It's a fucking big joke to you.  I'm...  I'll fucking show you a joke. 
[02:55:00]  You fucking asshole.  Oh, shit.  What a fucking...  You are so fucking unappreciative.  You are like a fucking cunt.  You're so fucking unappreciative.  You don't give one shit.  You're in there fucking laughing your ass off.  Where?  Where would I let my ass off?  Can you please talk to me, Dad?  I don't want to fucking even see your fucking face.  Why? 
[02:55:30]  Dad, please talk to me.  Because you were cunt.  You were fucking cunt.  What time is it?  It said like 11 fucking...  The next five minutes fast.  All right.  15 fucking minutes.  I'm there five minutes early.  I'm there for 20 fucking minutes.  People kept coming to the window.  You knew I was out there.  No, I didn't.  The greatest part is a baseball game obviously going on.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I was just hoping that some great thing would happen in the game where you would have to  stop to listen to see what's going on.  Of course, he's listening to the songs. 
[02:56:00]  America's pastime in the back.  Right.  Yeah, there's...  People kept coming to the window.  You knew I was out there.  No, I didn't.  You can't tell me what I know and not know.  Why didn't you come in and be like a normal...  Why didn't you go outside at 11 o'clock?  I thought you were not...  Like you told me.  You told me 11 o'clock.  You told me 11 o'clock.  And then you could have had a...  You told me 11 o'clock, fuckhead.  You could have had some needs to come in for your parents.  No.  You...  I did that last time.  Fuckhead.  You don't just do it once. 
[02:56:30]  You could have done it again.  I'm not saying it's your fault.  I'm just saying...  I'm telling you, you're a fucking cunt.  You're a fucking unappreciative fuckhead.  I've placed my income in a billion-dollar business with no employees.  One of the best parts is that my income is not tied to...  You don't give a flying fuck.  And I get to do all that wrong.  Calm down.  Who else loves the flying fuck, Chris?  Flying fuck.  I use that one a lot.  You don't give a flying...  See, this is the way...  I love the flying fuck.  This is the way Alec Baldwin could have come at his daughter. 
[02:57:00]  Right.  You know what I'm saying?  This is why, like, I thought he showed unbelievable resentment.  That's why the Alec Baldwin thing is no big deal.  Because the parents do that all the time.  We all heard...  We pretty much all heard what we're listening to.  Oh, my cunt.  Oh, yeah.  If you're a little older, you've...  We've all heard this.  And worse.  I'm a flying fuck.  Could you calm down?  Like, really?  Fifteen minutes?  That's pretty insignificant.  Why are you so mad with...  It's not insignificant. 
[02:57:30]  Yes, it is.  Fifteen minutes.  What the fuck?  Is it significant to you?  Sure, to you.  Yeah, it is.  You can't.  I'm sitting out there for 15 minutes.  For 15 minutes.  15 minutes?  Yeah.  Fuckin' 15 minutes?  Then I shouldn't be fuckin' waitin'.  You fuck?  Stop grabbing me?  You stupid fuck.  Yeah, that was 15 minutes.  Eleven o'clock.  You don't give a shit.  You know I'm always up at eleven o'clock.  No problem calling me.  Wake me up.  I'll go get ya.  Well, I don't fuckin' mind. 
[02:58:00]  But I do fuckin' mind  when I get away 15 or 20 minutes.  You fuckin' cunt licker.  35.  Cunt licker?  Cunt licker.  Hey, didn't we keep track of all the curses?  That's a compliment.  The last time he played this,  how many fuck shits?  Flying fucks.  You cunt licker?  You dick licker.  Then he corrected himself.  He didn't realize he fucked up cunt licker.  No, dick licker.  That's a compliment to him.  Yeah.  Hold on to the mark. 
[02:58:30]  You dick licker.  Excuse me.  Excuse me.  Excuse me.  Sorry I gave you the wrong...  Excuse me.  The wrong saying.  You mean cut licker.  All right.  I was trying to say that you're gay.  Love this guy.  Excuse me.  Excuse me.  You fuckin' asshole. 
[02:59:00]  You don't even give a shit about my fuckin' time?  Who gives a fuck?  What took you so fuckin' long?  Why did...  You're telling me?  Okay.  You're telling me?  Because what?  You're telling me?  Whoa.  Okay.  You're telling me it was a ten past eleven when you left that house, right?  I thought it was.  I wasn't paying attention at the time.  You don't even pay attention.  I made a shit.  Okay.  You don't even pay attention.  So the world revolves around you.  You don't even pay attention. 
[02:59:30]  You told me eleven o'clock.  You told me eleven o'clock.  So okay, I'll come pick you up eleven.  I'll say okay.  So you told me.  No, I didn't.  You asked Foddy what time you fuckin'...  I asked Laura.  She told me.  I would be bouncing this kid's head off the side of the window.  Oh, okay.  I'd be dead.  I'd be dead if I talked like that.  Oh!  Jesus.  You keep waiting for the sound and it never happens.  Yeah.  Just that kid's head going through a window.  That's the point I made.  Like, the kid knows.  He can get his father to lose it and nothing's gonna happen to him. 
[03:00:00]  And he's like taunting him?  I hate this kid.  Yeah.  Yeah, so do I, man.  Can I tell you the greatest thing I almost saw ever?  I was in a diner one time in Wildwood and there was a father and this retarded kid.  The kid was probably seventeen or eighteen.  And I'm eating and the kid was like, ah, blah, just being a real goose.  And it was just annoying everybody.  And he's like, ah, and I'm looking down eating and I heard, ah.  Oh my God, no.  Silence. 
[03:00:30]  I've never...  He cracked him one?  It was wonderful.  Oh my God.  And that's like...  Not a lot.  To that kid, it was like, ah, Bill Bird, ah, talking to his father about the Letterman  appearance.  I mean, that was everything to that kid.  I know it was a lot of blah-blahs, but...  And that kid's head of his, it was the most important thing ever.  But he forgot right after it happened.  They're like goldfish.  Right.  Eight seconds later, he was fucking happy again, eating fries on the floor. 
[03:01:00]  Oh my God.  Back to the father-son team here.  Yeah.  You just said I told you.  I was kidding.  I'm taking a left here, Mike.  Yeah, I guess so.  Tell me which way to go.  Well, I wait.  No, never mind.  Go straight.  Go straight?  Yeah.  You thought you were somewhere else.  He has a friend in the car?  Yeah.  I think you left off a cunt licker.  Shut the fuck up.  Left off a cunt licker, he said?  You're a fucking asshole.  You are a fucking asshole.  Dad, you need to calm down, buddy.  Oh, you need to fucking say, oh, Dad, I'm fucking sorry. 
[03:01:30]  Oh, Dad, I'm fucking sorry.  Not like that.  You said it just like that.  Not like that.  What do you want from me, cocksucker fuck luck?  Shut the fuck up.  Don't give me shit.  Okay.  You're not in any position.  I had to take all your shit.  You better fucking believe it.  I'm not a believer.  I'm not a strong believer.  You're fucking whining and crying, little fucking bastard.  I'm whining and crying.  See, like, right there, I have to take all your shit.  Right.  Right there would be like, well, you know what? 
[03:02:00]  Get your stuff and move out.  Yeah.  Now you don't have to take my shit.  Get the fuck out of here.  Let me tell you something, though.  They don't have an awful relationship, these two.  They actually seem like they have a pretty cool relationship.  Like, I know it sounds crazy, but it's like my friend Dean had a relationship with  his dad.  Like, I couldn't believe Dean would curse in front of his dad.  He'd go, get the fuck up.  It's like, this guy knows his father isn't going to belt him, and he's yelling at him.  He's furious, but he's yelling at him the way I would yell at one of my dumb friends.  I'm not saying it's the healthiest, but this does not seem like an abusive relationship. 
[03:02:30]  Oh, my God.  I couldn't imagine.  I couldn't imagine.  They do have a sense of humor.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  He'd take a left off cunt licker.  The one kid said it.  That sounded like it.  Was that his friend that said take a left off cunt licker?  Because Jeff, you're smarter.  I think it was his son.  It was his son?  That's pretty funny.  It is funny.  If you thought you were going to get hit, you'd never say that.  No, you wouldn't got past the first sentence in that whole tape.  You would have been there at 11.  Forget about it.  Yeah, you would have been there at 11.  That's hilarious. 
[03:03:00]  He's driving somebody home.  I'm going to fucking...  So, you're sitting in there.  The movie didn't get all the way.  I'm sorry.  I made a mistake.  You don't go looking for me.  I made a mistake.  Fuck you.  I made a mistake.  I don't believe it.  Good.  Then don't bitch about it.  She's not going to make shit better.  I don't fucking believe it.  You knew I was out there. 
[03:03:30]  No, I didn't!  Shit, they go looking.  The girl fucking left.  Her parent come.  She comes running right the fuck out as soon as they come.  What?  They're looking.  She's looking for the birds.  She's looking for her fucking ride.  Take a left ear.  Yeah.  Thank God, my God.  She's looking for her fucking ride.  I'm there before her fucking ride.  The movie came in and said, hey.  Did she have...  Did her fucking parent have to come in and get her?  I'm not her.  I'm sorry.  I made a mistake.  Fucking asshole.  I made a mistake, Dad.  Fucking dickhead.  I...  Normal fucking thing. 
[03:04:00]  Drive up.  Get out.  Go in.  I made a mistake.  Not with you.  Not with our kid.  No, I can't have that with my kid.  I'm sorry, Dad.  I made a mistake.  What do you want?  I fucking apologize.  If I thought that...  If I really thought that it wouldn't happen again, if you said, like you're saying, you're  sorry, I made a mistake, but I know it ain't going to make a fucking difference.  Right.  That's how I am.  Why don't you fucking accept me?  Oh, shit.  Who fucked up with your butt?  Should I fucking kill him now?  I hate how these things end. 
[03:04:30]  That's it.  Should I fucking kill him now?  This obviously continued.  Where's part two?  Yeah.  I hate that.  It leaves you hanging.  I want to know how the story ends.  You accept me the way I am.  Yeah.  A fucking asshole.  How great is that?  That's some relationship there.  Yeah.  It's another kind of father-son relationship.  What are you going to do?  They seem to like each other.  They seem to like each other.  Have fun in their language.  A weird, silly moment.  Like, I dropped you off, Mike.  It was such a normal thing for these two jackasses just to be yelling at each other, and the kid 
[03:05:00]  would never mouth off, like, fucking accept me if he thought he was going to get  his teeth knocked out.  Like, a really abusive father you would never say.  Oh, yeah.  You think the father, uh, how do you think he treats the wife?  Hopefully the same.  Probably.  Hopefully.  Probably good.  There are people actually saying that, uh, audio's fake.  You can tell it's not fake.  No, the acting is too good in that.  It would be too good.  You can tell that, uh, you know.  That guy was genuinely pissed when he first started.  And the son knows how to get under his skin.  Yeah, he lightened up a little and, and wasn't as pissed. 
[03:05:30]  Son knows the father wasn't taken any further than that.  Yeah.  So.  They're just bitching at each other.  My father got mad once, uh, when he heard, uh, Simon and Garfunkel, uh, Kodachrome, I  think it was.  Was that the one when I looked back at all the crap I learned in high school?  The first line?  He, he went like, he goes, ah, what?  You know, that kind of language.  That kind of language coming over the radio.  Kind of ironic now.  I really turned the screws on him.  Hey, pop.  Fuck.  How about that coming over the radio? 
[03:06:00]  He can't.  I know he's dead.  Yeah, he can't do it.  He's dead.  His ears aren't around anymore.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I probably would have bought him a truck or something.  Bill's, Bill's cringing.  Just like, Jesus.  Ah, what are you going to do?  And I are in the same boat.  Yeah.  So we kind of acknowledge, uh.  We're supposed to do.  What are you going to do?  Sit there and weep for, what, 12, 12 years?  It's been 12 years, 94.  It's been 13 years.  Enough.  Yeah, about 13. 
[03:06:30]  Yeah.  All right, we'll take a break.  Bill Burr at Comedy Connection at the end of the month.  I think this, now that we're on Terrestri, I'm doing, uh, hyping Zanies.  Zanies in Nashville.  Zanies.  This weekend.  Yeah, that's my weekend, baby.  All right.  Going old Tennessee.  I want to see how that works out for you.  What's wrong in Nashville?  I hear it's a cool town.  I hear it's actually, has kind of a rock, uh, uh, scene down there as well.  Does it?  Everyone says it's all about country, but supposedly it has a rock scene.  Yeah, Steve Seat used to go down there a lot.  Guys, wonderful.  That's a great transgender scene down there. 
[03:07:00]  How many bands are down there?  I stepped all over you.  How many bands are down there?  Uh, could be, uh, uh, uh, 10, could be, uh, a hundred million.  How about name, uh.  Let me go check.  Let me check the stats.  How about we name one band, rock band that came out of Nashville?  We all know about the country acts.  Uh, a rock band that came out of Nashville.  One lousy.  Elvis ain't rock.  Elvis was Memphis. 
[03:07:30]  He ripped off the black man.  That's right.  That was no rock.  One lousy rock band that came out of Nashville.  Rock band from Nashville.  Um, Nashville pussy.  Good one.  But I think.  Why did someone just write that?  Is that really a band?  Yeah, that is.  Who wrote it?  But they're like.  The second you said it, it popped up on Paltog, and I'm like, that's odd.  But that, I think they're alternative, uh.  I thought you were joking.  I thought you were joking.  No.  They're alternative country, aren't they?  Oh, are they?  Hawk, do we have a Nashville, uh, pussy song?  Kings of Leon are from Nashville? 
[03:08:00]  Yes, they are fabulous.  Just amazing.  They have so many fans.  Either 10 or 6,200,000.  Hang on, let me check.  Let me check.  Is it Leon or Leon?  Is it called Kings of Leon?  I've never heard of that.  I always said, uh, Leon.  What is it?  If it's Leon.  I love it.  I'm a little guessing.  Let's all just talk at the same time, because this is good.  What?  Two cheeseburgers or 500.  Or 500 cheeseburgers.  I'm not sure.  Let me check.  That dummy had no idea how to estimate with numbers. 
[03:08:30]  You say it's either 10 or 15.  Not either.  Well, I either have three or 409,575.  Minus the root.  But it is divisible by three.  Let me check.  Let me check.  I'd like four apples or the square root of 100,000.  You fucking.  Or the entire tree.  You blithering nothing.  Hey, uh, before the break.  God, he's great.  Wait, we got to move.  Um.  Oh, he's as dumb as they come. 
[03:09:00]  Um.  He's not listening.  All right.  Uh, Eric V. from Buffalo.  What's up?  Eric V. from Buffalo.  What's up?  You're on the air.  They killed my radio.  What's going on?  Yeah, how about you kill it?  I'm pretty good today, guys.  Well, we were until we took a phone call from Eric V. from Buffalo.  Yeah, yeah.  Put the brakes on.  Hey, give Trent Reagan a shout-out when you mentioned where I'm calling from.  We just did.  We like those guys.  So you give Trent Reagan and Buffalo a shout-out, yes?  And what else? 
[03:09:30]  Eric V.  Yeah, we got it.  Oh, he's listening to his radio.  My phone radio.  Why?  Because you're listening to the fucking radio.  That's why.  Do you understand?  You're listening to the radio.  Why the hell you got it on delay if you're on no swearing for satellite?  Because it has to bounce off the satellite, you dumb cunt.  Do you know?  Even sound waves that are put in electronically has to travel.  It takes a while to get through all the shit.  Good.  I hope his radio turned off. 
[03:10:00]  I'm still on the air.  Oh, okay.  If you go to YouTube, you click on the link for the McMahon limo blowing up.  If you wait, there's actually a link for a thing where he survives, and it's a spoiler  if you want to have your fans check it out.  Let's see what it is because...  It's probably his website he wants to plug.  We'll do it because you don't want to...  Yeah, I've heard this before.  We really...  I've heard this gag.  We try to hang in there as long as we can.  Yeah.  You're a lying queer and a dullard. 
[03:10:30]  Let's go to Joe in Massachusetts.  We should check to see if that is true.  Hello.  Hey, Joe.  I'm losing you guys.  What?  Oh, there you are.  Oh, my God.  Maybe the phones are fucked up because we are in another studio.  Good.  Joe.  I hope they are.  Joe.  He hears us.  Hello.  Is this thing on?  He's fucking with us.  Goodbye, Joe.  Joe.  Bye-bye.  I can't hear you.  Bye.  That's the word.  Is this thing...  Is this thing on?  It's called a phone.  Let's try Tim in Washington. 
[03:11:00]  Tim?  Hey, Tim.  Good evening.  Tim?  Yes.  33 years old.  Still scared shitless of my father.  Can barely hear you guys.  Yeah, see, there is something going on with the phone.  We knew how our listener beat the shit out of you.  Language.  All right, call back when we get the phones figured out.  Tim V from Buffalo.  We still hate you, even though you were right.  Yeah, you were a douchebag, even though you couldn't hear us.  Even though you were right.  All right.  Now turn up your radio and listen.  Even though you were right. 
[03:11:30]  Nashville.  Zanies.  This weekend with Bill Burr.  Seven shows are pun...  Hold on.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Hold on.  What?  Hold on.  Whose fault was that delay?  No.  Oh, is it?  I mean...  I didn't see you say go to break.  You didn't say go to break.  Did you?  Right there in front of you.  What?  Oh, shit.  Correct, open, humiliate.  What do you mean right in front of me?  I'm not talking to them live.  You're not on. 
[03:12:00]  I'm on Instant Messenger.  What?  When you just end like that, I had to type go.  Dude, I went with the dramatic, like, go to break.  I actually went like this.  I looked at you and went, boom, like, go.  Dude, did you have to type go?  Yeah.  Why didn't you just have go typed and sit there with enter waiting because you know  we're going to break, like, any second?  Why?  It wouldn't have made that...  One second wasn't...  That was sloppy.  E-Rock, you took the coolness away from me.  I was like, Bill Byrne, Nashville.  One second does make a difference.  You've got to type G-O, and it's 66.6% longer to do that with G-O and then enter. 
[03:12:30]  And then he has to spell check it.  I was going with the dramatic out.  Wow.  One second, if not...  Spell check, okay.  I don't mind swinging and missing.  No.  Jesus, the pitcher was still, like, holding it in his glove and I swung.  It was funny.  He had to spell check it.  It was a Tim Wakefield knuckleball.  That's very funny.  That's all.  It did.  Come on.  It turned.  You're allowed to type in the code before you hit enter. 
[03:13:00]  You don't have to wait until the alarm goes off.  And the phones don't work.  I don't want to ruin it for Jimmy.  The phones don't work.  If they're not working by the time we get back, then we go home early.  That's what we do.  Simple as that.  Why don't they just type the code in and then hit enter when the clock ticks down?  Ready?  Wow.  Look at this eye contact.  There's an evilness in your eye.  I want to see it work.  I want to see this work.  I want to see this work.  I like it.  This better be smooth. 
[03:13:30]  Say something right before you go to break so we know there's no delay.  You want to recreate that moment?  I was trying.  Honey.  Bill Burr in Nashville.

[03:22:30]  Are we or are we not?  Oh, there you go.  Unfortunately, whatever.  We got some nudity.  Why did XM take us off the air?  We were in the middle of a bit, and they don't get we're in the middle of a bit.  Now I have no problem with E-Rock.  We were doing that E-Rock bit before the break, right?  Yeah.  Where he missed my cue, so we reloaded and did it again, and I purposely fucked him up.  Yeah.  And they went to break. 
[03:23:00]  So who went to break if you didn't tell them to go to break?  E-Rock?  Anyone?  Derek is saying the whole time you were yelling at Eric, you were on the air.  What?  Yes, Steve.  Derek is saying the whole time you were yelling at Eric, you were on the air.  Right.  Well, Travis is now going to have a problem with that.  His hands are up in the air like, what the fuck?  But the second time we...  Travis, what happened?  Yes.  I have the online feed potted up in there, and we definitely went out on the air.  Derek, you hear that?  So someone fucked up somewhere. 
[03:23:30]  How about now?  Now we're on the air, right?  That's a good thing to check.  We were all at 6.50.  All right.  Here we go.  If the phones don't work, we go home early.  Nice pussy.  Whoa.  Steve says thank you.  Let's go to Chad in New Hampshire.  Chad.  Hey, how's it going, guys?  I heard you talking earlier about things you call a woman's pussy.  I got two of them for you.  We'll bring absolute horror to their faces.  First one's beef drapes. 
[03:24:00]  Second one is a visual and a burble.  You have to call it a hatchet wound and make the Atlanta Brave tomahawk chop sign.  Hatchet wound.  Heard that.  Yeah.  Beef curtains.  I've heard that.  Beef curtains.  Not drapes.  Beef drapes.  Meat drapes, he says.  Drapes.  He was trying to be original.  I respect the effort.  I like calling it meaty window treatments.  Yes.  I like to call them this.  I can't think of another thing.  Thank God.  That Steve would say. 
[03:24:30]  Yes, I like to call them.  Let me check.  Fleshy blinds.  Excellent.  Let's go to Sean in Pennsylvania.  Sean.  Sean.  Hey there, Sean.  You're on the air.  Hey.  You love the show.  Oh, someone loves the show.  Okay.  What do you got for...  I got a rock scream for you.  You ready?  Rock scream. 
[03:25:00]  It's rock.  Ready?  Yeah.  Hey, all right.  That was good.  I couldn't hear that.  Could you do that again?  What is it?  What?  I don't know.  That's something about Jimmy.  Let's go to Chuck in Pennsylvania.  Chuck.  Hey there, Chuck. 
[03:25:30]  Hi.  How you doing, boys?  All right.  Good.  I got a question for Jimmy from the box car.  Okay.  Does he remember the older woman that worked there that would beat the crap out of you  with her tits?  With her tits?  Yes, I do.  With her tits?  Like, Jimmy finishes freaking question.  Yeah.  Me and this guy have always been like that.  Wait.  Why wouldn't you tell that part of the story?  I forgot about it until my other half just said it.  Me and this guy, while I'll say something, he'll finish my sentence.  Yeah, sure.  Right, sir? 
[03:26:00]  See?  He knows.  Yeah, she was an old lady.  She'd smash it with her tits.  Yeah.  Were they big ones?  Were they like...  Big, heavy, awful ones?  Yeah.  I didn't go for...  I don't go over tit play.  No?  Why not?  No, although this one Indian girl came over.  Too girly?  And she had suckable nipples and I paid to suck them and she let me jack off.  Yeah.  Ooh.  And you couldn't do anything else.  I touched her back.  She put my hand away from her.  But she had big nipples.  Yeah?  Yeah, that was her specialty.  She took your hand away from her back because you didn't pay for that?  No, because she would only suck her tits. 
[03:26:30]  That's all you could do.  It was nipple play.  Where did you find her?  Craigslist, you goose.  Where else does a boy find Indian nipples to suckle?  Craigslist.  I've never heard of a...  You could get furniture from Craigslist and Indian nipples.  Yeah, exactly.  I can see, like, I don't have intercourse, blah, blah, blah.  I've just never heard just the sucking of the nipples and that's it.  It's the truth.  Yeah, except all she offered was nipple play.  I still look for her.  And escorts with big clits. 
[03:27:00]  Let's go to Flint in Canada, actually.  Flint in Canada.  Flint in Canada.  Flint in Canada.  Yes.  Hey, man.  Yes.  Flint.  Flint.  In Canada.  Yeah, how's it going, eh?  I got another name.  Moose Knuckle.  Well...  That's more for, um...  Oh!  These aren't anything new.  I don't think we're going to hear any new...  We're not going to get any new words for the vagina, whether they're through the pants 
[03:27:30]  or not through the pants.  Maybe that's the way to go.  Somebody come up with a new one.  Yeah, come up with a new one.  We know about Moose Knuckle, Camel Toe, Hatchet Wound, Clam, Beaver, Bush, Snatch, Snapper,  You know who comes up with new ones is little Jimmy Norton.  It's part of the HBO special he filmed down there in Washington.  Redding from Whackbag.  Opie, remember the guy who was fucking some girl that liked to be punched in the tits?  Yes.  One of the greatest stories of all time from our pal Chuck Barnum.  She used to...  To make her get the big O, he would punch her really hard in the boobs. 
[03:28:00]  And she would like to see him get bruised so she could look at the bruises the next day.  And that would be an extra turn-on for her when she was alone.  That would be a multiple.  Yeah, yeah, right.  Belayed multiple.  Multiple orgasm a couple days apart, yes.  But it's a true story.  And he would just pop her a little bit and she would go, no, harder, harder, harder.  And she would like to see him bruised up.  Yeah, she wanted like big black and blues on her breast to seize.  I'll slap you. 
[03:28:30]  Like I'll slap a girl.  I'll hold your hair and just crack your face.  Man, I actually like that.  Really?  Yeah.  Can you show me the expression on your face when you do that, Jim?  That would just really...  That can't be it.  That's very happy.  You got to put on like an attitude, right?  You put on an attitude.  Ta-da!  He looks like Bob's big boy.  No, it's...  Obviously the girl enjoys this.  Oh, without a doubt.  And you hold her hair and then we'll smack her in the face? 
[03:29:00]  Yeah, well, I would never do that.  How do you do that?  I would never do that because it's abusive.  Only if a girl likes it.  No, even if she likes it, how do you bring yourself to actually do that?  My question is, how do you not?  I can't...  Only when it's for real, sexy, and she's into it.  It's never to be abusive.  It's always because some girls are perverts and like that.  And it's just to me, it's so taboo.  And it's so dominating.  I like a good submission.  I'm incapable of doing that.  I can't smack a girl on the face.  I had one girl ask me to do it and it came up by accident, right?  We were laying there in bed and I was like joking around like, you know, I go, yeah, 
[03:29:30]  shut up, bitch.  Like, and jokingly went like that.  And then she goes, oh, I like that.  I'm like, what?  Did you care?  No.  I'm not.  I don't even know why I answered that.  Yeah.  So she was doing the whole, yeah, slap me in the face, but don't leave a mark.  And it was like, I'm just like, I can't do this because I'm going to fucking knock  you unconscious inadvertently.  And then the cops are going to show up.  You're going to be half naked in my bed and I'm going to be sitting there going, oh, she  wanted me to do it.  And then I get dragged out. 
[03:30:00]  There's some things that just don't work, right?  There was me and the rest of my band, Rotcut.  We were up in Kingston, I think it was, somewhere around there.  And we picked up on these girls that were at the club we were playing at and brought  them back to the band house because we were playing there a whole weekend.  So the place had this condo with bedroom, bunk beds, all kinds of things going on.  And we just partied there all night.  So we dragged a couple of girls back there, me and my brother, me and my brother. 
[03:30:30]  Now, the whole band is there, the road crew, everyone.  There's two girls, me and my brother.  And we had done all the legwork and stuff.  So my brother does whatever the hell he does with his girl.  And I'm kind of fooling around a little bit, getting things going.  And we're laying on the bed.  And I'm trying to be like this whole attitude, like I don't give a shit, kind of, you know,  whatever.  You know, fuck this guy. 
[03:31:00]  Because I didn't want this girl to think I liked her or anything.  And you were the lead singer, so.  Well, no, not at that time.  I wasn't even the lead singer.  I was on the fucking road crew.  It was, it was, no, it wasn't even a rock cut.  You're right.  It was a different band.  It was the one with Hugo.  Quebec or something.  Grave.  Ew, you were in a band called Quebec?  I didn't name it.  It was spelled with a K.  I have no idea.  Oh, that makes it cool.  No fucking idea why.  No, that makes it cool.  A C for cunt.  You're right.  I have no idea why.  But this girl rolls over in the bed and hits me like with her elbow. 
[03:31:30]  And I just went, I went, ah, you hit my fucking head.  And she goes, well, fuck you.  And gets up and fuck the drummer.  I was like, wow, she's sensitive.  Was it Def Leppard?  And she figured that he wouldn't be able to fight back as hard as you?  I was just like, you know, ah, you hit my fucking head.  Or you fucking hit my head or something like that.  And she just was like, well, fuck you.  She got all pissed, all pissy.  I was trying to just be like a tough guy.  I should have went like, oh, I'm sorry. 
[03:32:00]  Oh, rather than being the sensitive guy that you were?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Because I was, you know, I'm a pretty sensitive guy.  Pretty nice.  You know, and I figured I'd just be like, ah.  What was Quebec?  Was it like a hair metal?  What was like?  It was, yeah, kind of.  A lot of Journey covers because the guy looked like Steve Perry.  And Zeppelin because he sang, you know, he had a good high voice.  Stuff like that.  But then there was other stuff that was thrown in there, like, you know, a Joe Jackson song  or something. 
[03:32:30]  It was just this mishmash of whatever was going on in the 80s.  It was really bad.  How did you do that transition from like whole lot of love to love and touch and squeezing?  I don't know.  It worked, though.  My job was just to run the light show and blow things up.  That's all I did.  You were looking for a Joe Jackson song, right?  Yes, I was.  Stepping out.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Thank you, Opie.  Or, uh.  Mm-mm. 
[03:33:00]  Let's go to Jay in Tennessee.  Jay.  Hey, I was going to say, bacon strips for the pussy.  And I saw Jimmy in Nashville two times ago, and I thought he did a great job.  And during y'all's 30 days off, I bought my tickets for Bristow, Virginia.  I'm going to see y'all there.  All right.  Ticket sales for the D.C. show or D.C. area shows.  Wow.  Doing very well.  Yeah, it really is.  And, uh, we got, uh, Mohegan Sun coming up.  I don't know how to tell the hero on the phone.  Oh, well.  We got Mohegan Sun coming up, uh, the 30th, uh. 
[03:33:30]  Fuck now.  All right.  Jesus Christ.  Did they just get nervous on the phone?  I don't know.  What happened?  Maybe he couldn't hear.  I don't know.  It's an aneurysm.  What were you saying?  It doesn't matter.  30th, we have Mohegan Sun.  You had a ticket master.  And we're going to go up the day before and broadcast from the, uh, station up there in, in,  in the Mohegan Sun Casino.  The Wolf.  Yes.  We'll be there Friday morning.  So maybe we should do some kind of fun thing.  We all run around and play cards and play like.  Oh, yeah.  There's going to be cards being played. 
[03:34:00]  Old maid.  Old maid.  Is there an old maid table over there?  Yes.  Want to play that game?  High stakes old maid.  High stakes old maid.  You could bet either $10 or $650,000.  I'll check.  Let me check.  Let me check.  You're going to make you laugh all day.  Love the new Steve bit.  Eric and Indy.  The Steve, I have no fucking clue what number it is.  I can pinpoint the last day my father loved me.  Huh?  Yes? 
[03:34:30]  Yes.  It was similar to that story.  I get dropped off with my buddy at the movies.  We see a couple girls walking into Titanic.  We decide Titanic, that's fine.  We'll follow the girls in there.  30 minutes after the other movie was supposed to end,  I have the balls to walk out to find my dad  and ask if we can stay to finish the other movie.  He tells me, if you hurry,  I won't embarrass you in front of your friend.  Get him the fuck out here.  Wow.  What an asshole.  Well-deserved. 
[03:35:00]  I thought it was pretty fucking ballsy to ask that.  Hell yeah, dude.  I'm trying to think of how you can get a movie out of it.  Ah, yeah.  Well, now these stories come in.  Which ones?  Jeff in Chicago.  What's up, Jeff?  Hi, guys.  I used to fuck this crazy bitch, man.  She brought me to wrap her hands around her neck  and just choked the living shit out of her,  and then she choked me, too, at the same time.  And I tell you what,  sometimes I didn't think I was going to survive it. 
[03:35:30]  So then what, you throw an uppercut  just to get out of the clinch of the smasher?  Yeah.  That's some crazy stuff, man.  Choking I'm always careful with  because I'm always scared of hurting somebody's neck.  But that means you've done it, Jimmy.  Oh, yeah.  You've done the...  Choking? Yes.  Erotic asphyxiation?  Never, never.  Auto-erotic asphyxia  where you sit there and choke yourself as you jack off?  No, no.  Now choke yourself.  Did you do that, Jim?  I've choked, no.  Did you hang yourself from the chin-up bar 
[03:36:00]  that you don't use?  Oh, shit.  That was completely uncalled for.  I'm sorry, man.  I take my nipples gently while I take them off.  No problem for me.  Just gently?  Yeah.  So what's up with the choking?  If the girl wants it, I'll choke.  You've done that?  No.  To the point where she's going...  No, no, no.  Like gasping for air?  No.  Then what's the fucking...  What point do you choke her at?  There's either...  Choking doesn't really have a fucking volume knob on it.  They don't want to feel the... 
[03:36:30]  You're like...  You're either having your blood supply to your brain  or your air cut off  or you're not.  But then I stop it.  Like I don't go too long  because I'm not comfortable doing it.  So at one point did they go like...  Yeah, what is this safety word?  Yeah.  It's no safe word.  I squeeze.  I squeeze kind of hard.  When they go...  That means stop.  I just like Jim how he has this creepy calm tone to his voice  when he discusses anything sexual.  Oh, I know.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, I do that.  Because he's a professional. 
[03:37:00]  He's going to explain it to people.  If you would listen,  you would get to learn something about this.  Well, there's not much you can say about that  other than I never...  I have a few girls want it.  I don't do it too long  because it does frighten me  that you can really hurt.  Slapping somebody is one thing.  Choking somebody is a different fucking ball of wax.  You can get really hurt doing that.  So it's like, eh, a little bit.  A little bit of choking.  Yeah, like where...  It's like squeeze your own neck.  Could you demonstrate on like E-Rock?  Come here, Eric.  I couldn't get my hand around that...  E-Rock.  Call it.  I'm afraid if I squeeze it a fucking... 
[03:37:30]  A fish is going to fly out.  Why did E-Rock get up so eagerly?  E-Rock.  I don't want to grab that fucking awful neck.  Just choke him a little bit.  I want to see how...  It doesn't have to be sexy.  I want to hurt you.  It's just got to be like the volume of choke that you give.  It doesn't have to be, but it will be.  And I want to see like what...  No, I can't do it.  I can't choke your ears too,  because I'm going to get a rod.  He's all razor stubbly and stuff.  It's almost like...  Tell me if it...  I'll squeeze like that or a little bit harder,  but you see, it's a little bit, right?  Eric, what does that feel like?  Was your blood getting cut off a little?  Yeah, a little bit. 
[03:38:00]  Yeah.  Fuck that.  It's not too hard, right?  I'm not going to hurt you.  Fuck that.  But I don't like it done.  All right, kick him in the ball.  Come here, I'll show you how he gets done.  Did you see the video?  It's up on...  I saw it on break.  See, I was like...  I was scanning break.  Oh, you're smelling what?  You're smelling your hand after you choked him?  It's good cologne.  What are you wearing?  Ooh.  Ooh.  Sexy.  It's called ice sport.  You fucking...  Ice sport would when I see a man. 
[03:38:30]  That's what he's wearing.  Ice sport.  Ice sport?  What fucking...  What CVS did you pick this up out of?  Slap it on in the morning.  Dog shit.  What's the matter with that?  A fucking brute?  This is like six after brute.  When they're out of Old Spice, and you can't get a fucking dachshund to piss on your neck.  You're like, they got the ice sport.  And they're like, yes, we always have it. 
[03:39:00]  We've never...  No one's ever asked for it before.  But it smells...  This is the cheapest shit.  Wow.  Is it really cheap?  It's not.  Yes.  It's by Aqua Velva.  Aqua Velva.  He's an Aqua Velva man.  From the makers of Icy Hot.  Why didn't you get high karate?  This is something you dump on the floor to cover up a fucking murder.  Like, if you're afraid of the body, the fluids you're going to smell on the rug.  Ew, it's on my hand.  Why couldn't you wear something else for my choking, like some polo or something that would  be pleasurable? 
[03:39:30]  You got a drink.  All right.  Breaker, one, two.  Yeah, good, buddy.  Breaker.  Alan, what's up?  Yeah, Alan.  Yeah, your phone's really stuck.  But back when I was a teenager, I had this girl that started off saying, hey, just give  me a slap.  Give me a slap.  You slap her a little bit.  And next thing you know, I ended up full force punching her in the face.  And she wanted it all the way through.  Broken nose in one night.  And just bloody every time.  See, that's not sexy or anything. 
[03:40:00]  That is, like, that's a girl that's got major mental problems that likes, that needs abuse,  might not even like it, needs to be abused for some reason.  That has nothing to do with sexy.  I like how he was going, like, no, no, that isn't healthy.  But no, no.  But I, like, wailed her.  Yeah.  And I was like, this is so fucked up.  As I was breaking her jaw.  This is just breaking her bones in her face and her eye socket.  How could you?  I could never do that.  No.  No.  I don't know how you do that. 
[03:40:30]  That's fucking, dude, that's violent, man.  I can't even do the slight choke or the slap thing.  I'm sorry.  I could spit in a girl's mouth.  I'm sorry.  I used to, one girl used to, like, she'd lick, this is true, she would lick my ass.  I would choke her while she'd lick my ass.  This is true.  Not hard.  She, like, I would hold her neck while she'd lick.  It was just a dominance thing.  It wasn't to her.  It was just hold her neck.  It wasn't even really a lot of pressure.  I'd straddle her.  This is the way he explains.  That's creepy, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  He gets the whole look and explains it like a serial killer confesses to all that.  And then, no, I chopped her head off. 
[03:41:00]  It's that Hannibal Lecter where your blood pressure doesn't go up.  Right, right.  His pulse doesn't go up at all.  He could just.  All right.  I'll do it.  I would straddle her face.  And I'd plop my asshole out of her mouth.  Now, I'd be facing down by her pussy and so.  All right.  You make a good point.  And I'd reach down and grab a little gal's neck and I'd rub my asshole on her mouth and  I'd say, lick.  Lick.  And then I'd lean back and I'd say, open. 
[03:41:30]  And my mouth would open.  And I would spit into her mouth.  Wow.  Or just on her face.  She liked that, too.  It was fucking hot.  Seriously.  That's some fucked up shit right there.  I would never want to do it to a girl who didn't like it.  If a girl doesn't like it, that wouldn't turn me on.  No.  You know.  I like high energy, Jimmy.  I got to admit.  Yeah.  It was fun.  It was kind of fun.  And then, pal.  I'd put it right in her shitter.  Thank you.  Yeah.  I saw this video on Break.  It's this kid. 
[03:42:00]  Don't say it.  Oh, right, right, right.  Break.  Break.com.  I saw this video.  It was this kid and he had a friend or I guess he was a friend.  He probably, I think he hated this kid.  And they were doing this thing with the binoculars and looking at the sun, saying, if you turn  the binocular backwards and look at the sun through one eye, you'll sneeze.  So this kid, he gets him to do it.  I thought it was going to burn out his eyeball.  He didn't do that.  He goes, no, it's not.  He goes, you don't feel anything?  And he goes, no.  And he goes, well, shut one eye. 
[03:42:30]  So he shuts one eye.  He's looking.  He's looking up.  And then the kid kicks him square in the ball as hard as he can because the kid can't  see.  He's looking through the binoculars.  He kicks him in the balls.  The kid goes down and then he punches him in the side of the face and then takes the binoculars  out of the kid's hand and throws it at his head.  And the kid's down there going, oh, fuck, fuck.  I don't know why he did this.  It seems like they were friends.  But when the kid kicked him in the nuts, it did not seem like they were friendly. 
[03:43:00]  Wow.  Like he set him up for something really bad and nailed him.  Friends, you sort of.  Oh, here it is.  Punch him in.  I got to see this.  Damn.  All right.  You're going to have to fast forward a little until he gets to the kick in the nuts portion.  But it's it's he fucking wails him.  Right in the balls.  He's looking up at the sun.  And so he can't he can't see what the kid's doing with what the other kid's doing.  Go forward more.  Yeah.  Oh, it's it's loading.  Is it?  How did you stumble onto this? 
[03:43:30]  Yeah.  What did you search under to get that?  So people at home could participate.  Best binoculars prank yet.  Oh, OK.  Best binoculars prank yet.  Is that one kid older than this kid or no?  He looks like he's a little older because the kid that kicks him in the nuts looks like  a real young kid.  He looks like about 14, maybe.  And the other kid looks about, I don't know, 15, 16.  I don't know.  But he fucking just nails him right in the balls and then punches him in the face.  He doesn't look like a tough kid.  He looks like he's wearing pajamas, too. 
[03:44:00]  He's totally in the field.  He was winding up to kick him right there.  And then the kid put the binoculars down for a second.  And he's totally taunting him.  He's going, no, no, really.  Just look at it.  Do you feel it?  Do you feel it yet?  Right in the balls.  And then, bam, punches him in the face, picks up the binoculars and throws him out.  Oh, he's a real little prick.  That's pretty funny.  That's great.  Yeah, that's on break.  It's a doozy. 
[03:44:30]  All right.  I don't like bullies.  I like watching videos of kids beating the shit out of each other.  There's a lot of it on there.  I saw a girl one yesterday.  It seemed like one girl was mad at another girl for some guy problem at a beach parking lot.  And they went at each other.  And then it was just a riot of girls just beating up on each other.  But they never ripped off their bathing suits.  It's like one girl was in this really like a one-string-around-her-back kind of bikini-top thing. 
[03:45:00]  Never ripped it off.  If I was one of those chicks, boom, that would have come right off.  Smack her tits around a little bit.  But that's when guys fight.  You want the guy to, like, rip the guy's clothes off?  Yes.  No.  If it's girls fighting, then that's the last thing on your mind.  Yeah, but it would have been a great thing to rip her top off.  And then she would have tried to cover up her bosoms.  And then the other girl could have punched her in the face a little more.  All right.  Mike in Detroit, what's up?  Hey, Hope, how's it going?  I'm sick today.  Hey, I got a name for the cooch. 
[03:45:30]  It's a vent.  And once in the Army, I was skull-fucking this broad.  And I shot it down her throat, and it came out her sinuses.  I don't know if anyone else has ever witnessed that.  How does it come out her sinuses?  You mean it came out her nose?  Yeah, it came right out her nose.  She's got a swallow, and she got scared.  All right.  He's laughing at himself.  He said, skull-fucked her.  He said, the vent.  Is that it? 
[03:46:00]  He never explained it.  I've heard the flu.  You know, like a chimney flu?  Yeah.  Like, yay, jam it up our fucking flu.  I've heard that one.  Women hate any time you just refer to their cunt as something separate from them.  All right, we're doing line of the day.  Bill Burr is going to be at Zaney's in Nashville this weekend.  For seven shows.  Seven, wow.  If not one.  I'll have to go check. 
[03:46:30]  End of the month.  There's Comedy Connection up there in New England.  Yes.  Runner-up line of the day.  Is the board on?  Is the board on?  Uh-oh.  Oh.  He's taking a wrecking ball to our body is what he did.  Oh, guys.  He's going to have to find a grounds crew to get that course back in his head.  Woo.  Hey, I got a runner-up. 
[03:47:00]  Got a runner-up.  I like that one.  Sick boy, dude.  I'm watching the OK Cable Girl.  Yeah.  Doing her stupid song.  All right.  And finally, here is your line of the day.  Here comes.  Here comes.  Line.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  That dummy had no idea how to estimate with numbers.  You say it's either 10 or 15. 
[03:47:30]  Not either.  Well, I either have three or four hundred and nine thousand five hundred and seventy-five.  Minus the root.  I'd like four apples or the square root of a hundred thousand.  Shit.  Blithering nothing.  Darn.  Fuckers.  I'll check.  Let me go check.  I wouldn't say that was line of the day, but I thank the nod.  But the darn makes me very happy.  Darn is very funny.  Darn.  Sorry, Steve.  All right.  We'll be back tomorrow. 
[03:48:00]  Bill Burr.  Thank you.  Thank you for having me.  Anything else you want to promote?  You're good?  Nope.  That's it.  All right.  Is this a real show or a fake show right now?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Did someone jump the gun?  I don't know.  Why are they not?  I don't know.  I gave the cue and everything that time.  You did give the cue.  I couldn't possibly.  I cued them and stuff. 
[03:48:30]  Make sure you go to break.com sometime today.  We're featured on the front page.  Doing a little thing with them today.  Yes.  If not the second page, I'll have to check.  Yes.  We have a few videos up.  The exact number is, I think, five or six million.  I'll have to check.  You can either go to break.com or thecatholicleague.org or Google.  I don't know exactly what the site is.  It's either www or there's an X with two Ys and a pound sign. 
[03:49:00]  I'll check.  Just languishing in vagaries.  I can bite your fucking face.  Ah, shit.  Wonderful.  Somewhere else point, maybe it'll work better.  Point.  And, uh, Roger.  End of the show, uh, five, four, three, two, ignition sequence, one, and go for end of show. 
[03:49:30]  Still the anatomy show.  The virus is spreading.  END  THISTICAL
