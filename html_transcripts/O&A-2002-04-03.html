<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion of "Whip Them Out Wednesday," a listener-driven segment encouraging women to flash drivers displaying "WOW" stickers.  The hosts also addressed the impending loss of their show in two unnamed cities (listeners speculated San Francisco and Columbus) and the addition of a new city, attributing the cancellations to a lack of local station promotion and vowing a "Bash Fest" in retaliation.  This was interspersed with listener calls offering cryptic clues about the cities losing the show, including one using the phrase "F*** [city names]" as a clue.  Jim Norton was a guest in the studio throughout much of this segment.  The hosts also bragged about their unauthorized playing of four unreleased Korn songs, resulting in a cease-and-desist letter from Sony Music, and their plan to continue their "Leak and Release" segment.  They further discussed a million-dollar radio contest scam involving a single winner fraudulently presented as winning from multiple stations.

A significant portion of the show was dedicated to sexually explicit content.  This included detailed discussions of the pornographic film *Playmate of the Apes*, featuring audio clips and descriptions of the plot, actors (including Darian and Terry West), and poor production quality, with a production assistant providing insider information.  The hosts engaged in extensive, highly inappropriate ad-libbing during a commercial read for "Sweet Release," a sexual enhancement product.  A phone call with Jay Moore discussed his humorous, overtly gay-themed opening for a new sports show, using homophobic slurs in the process.  Dr. Allison from *Temptation Island* shared her opinions on the taste of semen and common male sexual mistakes in a similarly crude and sexually explicit conversation.  A conversation with Playboy model and former Flex Appeal host Kiana Tom involved sexually suggestive comments and jokes about her Playboy spread and physique.  Kiana also promoted her website featuring workout videos and recipes.  This led to a lengthy discussion referencing *Stripes*, with Bill Murray and Harold Ramis impressions.

Further segments involved a caller, Marcus, pitching a song idea for a Jim Norton bit, which spiraled into discussions about his parking lot job and interactions with Kiana. The hosts previewed upcoming show content, including segments on a Mount Everest climber with asthma, the Osbournes' MTV show, and a quiz on common male sexual mistakes. Multiple callers phoned in, including a program director confirming their show's continuation in Las Vegas, a Las Vegas listener, and a listener who claimed to have had sex with an animal.  The cancellation and addition of cities was heavily debated, along with a call from Le’Jean, lead singer of Seven Dust, discussing their tour and a biker fight.  A listener shared a link to a website detailing sex with dolphins, leading to graphic discussion of dolphin anatomy and sexual practices. The show continued with discussions of Ozzy Osbourne's exhaustion from his wife's demands on the Osbournes' MTV show, and included audio clips from that show.

The broadcast culminated in a phone call with Ozzy Osbourne himself.  He recounted an incident involving inadvertently exposing himself to his neighbors while mowing the lawn, shared a self-composed jingle about Jim Norton, expressed his dislike for bubble machines, and detailed an extravagant family shopping spree that depleted his credit card, jokingly threatening to call Protective Services.  He ended the call by stating he was calling from his helicopter.  The show concluded with a "What Did We Learn" segment featuring callers sharing crude and sexually suggestive anecdotes, with many references to dolphins, various sexual acts, and jokes about Jim Norton.  The broadcast also included playing a humorous commercial for “Playmate of the Apes.”

[00:00:00]  It's Whipple Mal Wednesday, it's Whipple Mal Wednesday, it's Whipple Mal Wednesday, it's Whipple Mal Wednesday, it's Whipple Mal Wednesday, it's Whipple Mal Wednesday, it's Whipple Mal Wednesday, it's Whipple Mal Wednesday, it's Whipple Mal Wednesday, yep. 
[00:00:30]  Yep.  Yep.  Yep.  That's right!  That's right!  That's right!  Stay out the bushes!  It's Wimple Mountain Wednesday!  Yeah!  It's Wimple Mountain Wednesday!  It's Wimple Mountain Wednesday!  Look what he's doing now! 
[00:01:00]  All right!  1027 WNEW  Whip them out Wednesday!  Woo-hoo!  Yes.  Yes, yes, yes.  Whip them out Wednesday.  On the Opie and Anthony Show.  Let's get the phone numbers out of the way in the New York area.  877-692-1027.  Anywhere else, including...  New Orleans!  Nah! 
[00:01:30]  I hear we did a little better in New Orleans.  Uh, boys, you did a little more good-er.  I checked some of the numbers, and they looked a little more good-er.  Did we do good enough to continue broadcasting in that fine city?  Now that's the question, ain't it, over here.  Two cities dropping the O&A show in the very near future.  Uh-huh.  We're still trying to work something out behind the scenes, but it's not looking good, Anthony.  It's not looking good. 
[00:02:00]  No.  So, if you're outside of New York, including New Orleans.  New Orleans.  Wow.  866-2774.  Wow.  866-2774.  Wow.  866-2774.  Wow.  Well, dude, wow is just about ready to explode.  Well, you know, on a day like this, I hope your city was as beautiful as New York City was  this morning.  Although it's turning real bad real fast.  It's getting all cloudy and cold.  But, uh...  Yeah, they're gonna rain on our wow today here in New York. 
[00:02:30]  It was mid to upper 70s.  It was like 70 at 8 in the morning.  Which is great.  I walked out of the apartment, I'm like, oh, here we go.  Now you're talking.  And then I thought, and it's Wednesday.  I didn't see any on the way in though.  I might wow on.  I didn't see any boobins though.  Yeah, it's like fishing.  Yeah, I think we gotta get the call out there.  It is time to get wow on your cars, ladies and gentlemen.  Yeah.  This is the greatest radio promotion ever, I'm telling you right now. 
[00:03:00]  Anyone can be involved.  We have thousands upon thousands of winners a week.  There's no qualifying.  A week.  Right.  You see lovely, luscious, luscious breasts, as Opie said when he was quoting some of his artistic works.  On the Bill O'Reilly thing.  Right.  Once you see those, you're a winner.  You're a winner.  The girl's a winner.  Everyone wins with wow.  Yeah, so guys and ladies.  There's a lot of ladies that want to see boobies on the way home from work. 
[00:03:30]  Yep.  It's time to get the wow in the car.  We don't care if it's one of the bumper stickers or a homemade wow sign.  In fact, we love the homemade wow signs.  Oh, yeah.  But let's get them up and going now, guys, all right?  As a matter of fact, we're sending the wow van out today to hand out wow stickers here in Manhattan.  And I strongly suggest the other cities get on the ball and start handing those things out like crazy if they have them.  Right.  Because it's just a matter of time.  When daylight savings time hits...  Oh, forget it.  Yeah, it's all over.  It's all over. 
[00:04:00]  Then everyone's driving home from work.  It's nice and light out still.  Nice weather.  Got the windows down.  Wow on your car.  And then before you know it, you're looking over going, why the hell is this girl showing  me her book?  Maybe she likes me.  Maybe...  Oh, that's right.  I got a wow on the car.  You'll be like, son of a...  Son of a gun.  Those guys were right.  It works.  This is kind of...  What is this?  Like opening day for us in wow?  It's...  It's still pre-season.  Still in pre-season.  Still in pre-season, but really gearing up for opening day.  We're still working out the rotation.  Oh, okay. 
[00:04:30]  We're still working out the rotation and giving everyone a chance to bat.  But we're taking a...  But we're getting close to opening day.  We're taking the...  Today could have been opening day if it was still nice out there.  I know.  It got crappy.  But the rain is moving in fast here in New York, so...  But we're sending the van out.  But let's be real.  Wow happens all the time.  Yeah.  But now we're going to start focusing on it like crazy now that spring is right around the  corner, okay?  And that's when the big wows show up on the sides of bridges.  There's a job site.  There's a lot of people building around the buildings.  They got the big wood out the side, nailed to the side of their job site. 
[00:05:00]  Big wows on there.  We encourage wow on live TV in your city.  Oh, oh, oh.  We give out great prizes to the people that get wow on live TV, including all the WWF events.  Yeah.  But at this point, that's a no-brainer.  That's easy.  We're looking for some creative people out there to take it to the next level, Anthony, right?  Absolutely.  But basically, if you don't know the deal, you put wow in your car, and if the ladies  feel like it, they will flash you on the way home from work. 
[00:05:30]  Mm-hmm.  We ask two things.  Don't harass the ladies and don't follow the ladies.  Right.  A lot of ladies will do this on their own.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, I'm sure we'll have a bunch of ladies calling today telling us they're somewhere  wowing.  All right.  All right.  You know, it's very interesting about the markets that are dropping the program, Opie.  Yes.  I'm speculating.  I don't think I've seen one person from one market, from one of the markets that are  going to drop us, actually call and say, is it our market? 
[00:06:00]  Oh, you just gave away a great hint.  A little clue there.  I know.  I thought about that beforehand.  But I don't know if everyone's keeping track of who's called up asking.  But it just seems no one really cares.  I think you're right.  Yeah.  I haven't seen one call from a person in one of those markets that is saying, hey, is  it us?  Well, one of the cities, they never really got the concept.  No.  They never.  It's starting to look like they never really wanted us.  They didn't push it.  They didn't do anything to try to make the show successful. 
[00:06:30]  I'm waiting for your cue on the Bash Fest.  I haven't really.  Oh, it's going to get ugly.  Yeah.  I've heard it back in the office.  Yeah.  It's going to get really ugly.  Yeah.  They don't even know what they're in for.  So I'm eagerly waiting.  Oh, yeah.  I'll give them a couple phone numbers to call so they can find out what they're in for.  Yeah.  Go call Steve Kingston here in New York.  Go call Dave Dickless.  Yeah.  In Boston.  Ask them.  Ask them a couple of questions about what it's like when this show, the Opie and Anthony 
[00:07:00]  show, are up against you.  Right.  You know, you're either with us or against us.  Yes.  And if you decide to turn against us, we do indeed always win in the end.  Oh, I got a great story to tell.  So we'll turn up and we'll kick ass.  I got a great story to tell when it's all said and done.  Let's just put it that way, okay?  Mm-hmm.  Something else to add to the mix, Anthony?  Yeah.  We're going to be gaining a city as well?  Yes, we are.  See? 
[00:07:30]  We lose two.  We're going to gain one, though.  The opening door.  So you do the math, that means we're only going to lose one city overall.  Uh-huh.  One city coming aboard very soon.  Very excited.  Oh, yeah.  To have the Opie and Anthony show in their city.  Yep.  We'll be announcing that in the very near future.  Very excited.  All right.  Is it a station that actually wants us?  Oh, yeah.  And actually hiring us to be on their station with the intention of keeping us there?  Oh, yeah.  Not hiring us to keep us off of other stations? 
[00:08:00]  Oh, yeah.  See, that's a great strategy.  You hire Opie and Anthony to come to your station in your city and you never really wanted  us.  You don't believe in the show.  You don't believe the show fits on the station.  But you believe in the show enough to know that it might be a little detrimental having  it in your city somewhere else.  So you lie and say things and get the show.  And then after a while, what happens? 
[00:08:30]  All of a sudden, don't want it anymore.  The funny part is, there's going to be two guys that aren't going to really be fitting  in with the company.  Yeah.  As well as they thought.  Yeah.  As well as they thought.  Mm-hmm.  So.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  Speaking of wow really fast too, because we have thousands of winners every week.  Yeah.  There's a radio station in New York that wink, wink, nudge, nudge gave away a million dollars.  Oh!  There is a scam going on in the radio business. 
[00:09:00]  And we like giving you guys the inside scoop.  They, you know that corporate America is pretty much taking over radio, unfortunately.  Yeah.  The big corporations, CBS.  And they're, you know, hey.  As we are.  Yeah.  We're part of it.  Let's, you know, let's face facts here.  But, uh, one of the, one of the, uh, radio groups owns, uh, over a thousand stations.  A thousand stations.  And they're, uh, and they got one winner for a million dollars. 
[00:09:30]  Oh, is that the gag?  Yeah.  I've heard of this one.  Well, what they're doing on all thousand stations is making it sound like the million  dollar winner came from their cité.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They don't mention where they're from.  It's really sad.  The odds of winning this thing are so ridiculous.  Mm-hmm.  It's not even funny.  But how they promote it and market it on all these stations, it sounds like anyone in your  city could win a million dollars.  Yeah.  What do they do?  All the stations that are running it say call now and it goes to some central switchboard 
[00:10:00]  somewhere.  Yeah.  So, wow, the odds are even getting through.  Yeah.  But they're kind of deceiving all their listeners.  It's kind of sad.  It's really sad.  Hey, you're the winner.  Yeah.  And then they had the person do IDs for all thousand stations.  So, it sounds like they won on that station.  Oh, boy.  And I heard a couple of these and it's so chopped up.  I hear they also, they interview the winner.  Someone interviews him and then all the rest of the stations get his answers and the questions 
[00:10:30]  that were asked by whoever asked them the questions.  And then they get their popular DJ from that station to cut in his voice asking those  questions.  Just like if you remember on this very station a couple of years back, our own Psycho Mark  doing the Stacker 2 commercial.  Remember the woman answering his questions?  Oh, yeah.  She never answered that.  Did you talk to your doctor about Stacker 2?  I did.  And, you know, it just cuts in.  Different sound quality.  Different room. 
[00:11:00]  Different country.  You will.  You want to give the plug?  Stacker 2 works great.  Thank you.  It's just Mark.  And, you know, I heard the same commercial on another station with some other jock asking  and it's the same girl with the same answers.  It's such big.  It's kind of a little sham that the people that do commercials use.  Another little radio trick.  Brian from San Francisco.  What's going on, Brian?  Hey, guys.  I just wanted to say goodbye before you guys got cut off from San Francisco because I know 
[00:11:30]  it has to be us.  Well, it's not looking good for you guys.  Yeah, you know, I think there's probably 10 listeners.  I hear when we go to commercial in San Francisco, they play maybe one commercial.  Yeah.  That's never a good sign.  Maybe two.  And then, what, really bad music until we get back on the air, right?  That's absolutely right.  They're all pretty much PSA, you know?  Ooh, that's never good.  Yeah, and we're like way the hell up at the top of the dial, you know, on AM, so it 
[00:12:00]  doesn't look good for San Francisco.  Yeah, if I was a betting man, I would definitely put money towards San Francisco.  San Francisco being one of those cities.  I'm not trying to clue anyone in, Anthony.  I'm just stating some facts here.  It would be odds.  They'd be an odds-on favorite.  They would be an easy three to one.  Yeah.  I've been listening to you guys for a while.  Not too long, but, you know, I've been listening pretty much every day.  Yeah.  There is one question, something I didn't quite understand from listening to the show.  Yeah, go ahead.  Ah! 
[00:12:30]  Hey, well, I think that qualifies as...  Yeah, because you did answer.  Yeah.  Craig, what's going on?  Please, God, don't leave Washington, D.C.  Hey, you guys are kind of getting friendly to us.  I know.  I'm feeling kind of good.  Hey, that's nice.  That's nice to hear.  What can I do?  I didn't say we were going off the air in D.C.  What can I do?  I'll tell you this.  I'll tell you this much.  Your chances of keeping the program in D.C. is much greater than San Francisco. 
[00:13:00]  Yeah.  We did more good in D.C.  You guys are like a 20 to 1 odd of losing the show.  All right, good.  And then we've got to get more people on down here, man.  I don't think they understand, but...  Yeah, we're coming down to D.C. for a Norton show in the very near future.  I want to get a little feel from somebody in one of these cities that are going to be taken off as to how they feel about us being taken off.  All right.  So, Joe from Instant Feedback. 
[00:13:30]  Joe.  All right.  Now, please, Joe, answer back on Instant Feedback and let me know how you feel knowing that, yes, indeed, Joe.  Oh, wow.  I just kind of want to get a feel now.  You want to get a feel if there's going to be some outrage?  A little backlash.  I want to see how Joe feels about this happening in his city. 
[00:14:00]  All right.  So, is he going to Instant Feedback back, I guess?  I'm eagerly awaiting once the delay kicks in.  All right.  Let me go to Fabio real fast.  Fabio, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I know exactly what you're talking about with the contest, because I know the contest you're talking about.  I've heard it.  And when I heard the promo that the winner was from New York, I was like, oh, cool.  At least, you know, for change, this national contest has a New York winner.  Let me tell you something, Fabio.  She could have very well been from New York.  I really don't know. 
[00:14:30]  But what I'm trying to tell you is that all the other cities that have stations by this company are making it look like, you know, she's from that city.  Yeah, no, and it's impossible to get through.  By the way, being a longtime Rush fan, I'm happy to hear there's new music coming out.  Any chances of hearing some deep cuts before their release?  Are we playing some deep cuts, Opie, today?  Well, maybe we'll debut the Rush stuff.  Are you saying we'll get that right on for you?  We're pretty much taking on the whole music business, Ant and I. 
[00:15:00]  Cool.  Garrett's awesome.  We have decided to take on the whole music business.  They're a little angry, though.  Because we have nothing to lose at this point.  Yeah, yeah.  And I know there's always leaks out there.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  They're very angry.  When our faithful listeners get a leak of something that is going to be released, you send it to your pals, Opie and Anthony.  Yeah.  We'll be the first always to play it because we have nothing to lose.  We don't have to kiss these record companies' asses. 
[00:15:30]  And why, Opie?  Why don't we have to sit back and think, hmm, if we leak this record that isn't supposed to be on the air, the record company's going to be pissed at us.  We better not do it because we get this from the record company.  Yeah.  And the answer's nothing.  The reason we could do what we did yesterday is because they can't do anything to us.  See, they threaten the rock stations by saying, hey.  All right.  You leak this.  You're not getting any artists.  When you pull your yearly big concerts, we're not going to supply any artists for that. 
[00:16:00]  They're not coming by for interviews.  You're not getting the next one before the other station does.  A term they use in the business.  We're going across the street.  Across the street.  Well, us, they've done nothing but listen to the person across the street and not giving us the artists and taking the threats.  So now it's like, screw them.  We'll play.  And I'm saying it right now to any record company exec that's listening.  We're going to play everything when it comes out.  Send your little notes. 
[00:16:30]  Send your letters.  Don't matter.  We're playing everything.  Everything.  Because our listeners will find this stuff for us.  Just like they found the corn thing.  We played five songs yesterday.  You know?  Because we've been shut out of the whole music business for too long now because of Steve Kingston across the street,  the douchebag.  Who likes to say that it isn't that way when we see him in person.  Yeah, because we work for the same company.  Oh, no.  I don't do that, guys.  I don't do that.  Yeah, okay.  All right.  I wouldn't do that.  The fact is, we love Rock. 
[00:17:00]  Yeah.  We did some of the first interviews with a lot of the people you know and love today.  Rock.  Rock Corey.  Including Fred Durst.  Yes.  Godsmack used to hang on our show before there was a Godsmack.  Watching the German S-videos with us live in the studio.  Lee loves that crap.  Sully gave us one of the best crap videos ever.  We invited a bunch of people up into the studio, played the videotape, and they all had to eat Snickers and bars while we were watching it. 
[00:17:30]  That was a hilarious day.  Yeah.  We had one of the first interviews with Creed.  Kid Rock.  Mm-hmm.  Korn.  Seven does.  And now we all get...  Never talked to Tool.  I would love to talk to Tool.  Now we get shut out.  So we get shut out.  So this is what we do now.  Oh, well.  It's called...  It's a new segment on the ONA show called Leak and Release.  When you guys leave D.C., do I get my old slot back?  Thank you, gentlemen. 
[00:18:00]  And please buy my stupid-ass calendar, G. Gordon Liddy.  Liddy wants his slot back.  Dino, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  What's happening?  Hey.  Listen, I was watching VH1 this morning.  Yeah.  And they have this thing on.  It's called The Ticker.  And it tells you, like, Tommy Lee beat up Pamela this week.  You know what?  It's Jumpstart on VH1.  And I love that.  I watch that every morning.  Right.  You've seen your name this morning.  They said that Korn's people were upset with you for playing it. 
[00:18:30]  How could they be upset?  They got a half-hour commercial yesterday.  Yeah, Korn's people ain't upset.  Korn's not upset.  MTV's not upset.  Sony Music's not upset.  They got to make believe they are.  Yeah.  They loved that yesterday.  No doubt.  We did.  And you notice no other radio station had the balls to play any tracks from the CD,  especially after we did it.  They got something to lose.  And you know what's worse?  Oh.  Oh, come on, dude.  You're killing me.  That's true. 
[00:19:00]  I guess we made...  Wow.  I guess we made MTV.com, Anthony.  Yeah.  It says, shock jocks give new Korn LP, premature, premiere, perturbing label.  More than two months before the album is officially released, listeners got a feel for the new Korn album, Untouchables, on Tuesday,  thanks to syndicated radio personalities, Opie and Anthony.  The shock jocks, whose four-hour afternoon radio show is syndicated in 18 cities, soon to be 16, and then 17 again,  nationwide from New York station, WNEW, played four songs from Korn's fifth album, due June 11th. 
[00:19:30]  After premiering the third, Tear Me Down, the show received a cease and desist letter from Sony Music Entertainment  for the band's label, Epic, threatening legal action if they continue to play the unauthorized songs.  They got some of our quotes in here, Anthony.  If we stop playing tracks from Untouchables, the new Korn CD, right now because we read that letter,  wouldn't we be considered pussies, Opie asked over the air.  Anthony replied,  Yup. 
[00:20:00]  Yup.  Here's my reply on tape.  Yup.  Yup.  Yup.  Opie says,  Okay, this is Korn from the CD Untouchables.  Yup.  This is falling through time.  Yup.  As the track queued up, the sound of tearing paper could be heard.  Off the air, Anthony swore it was the legal notice being torn.  Yup.  It's laying here in pieces, he said.  Yup.  13 Untouchable tracks, including its single here-to-stay, had been online via various peer-to-peer file-sharing applications,  such as Morphous and, uh, I don't know, KAZA. 
[00:20:30]  K-A-Z-A-A.  That's right!  That's right!  For weeks, which is where the station obtained the songs for the broadcast.  Here-to-stay has been made available for download on MTV.com, blah, blah, blah.  Uh, then they kind of critique, uh, the songs.  Oh, yeah.  Giving it kind of, uh, a thumbs up.  The reason for the premature premiere, Anthony said, was to infuriate a rival New York station,  which disallows their in-studio guests to appear on the Opie and Anthony show.  No matter what you say.  That is the truth. 
[00:21:00]  When they heard the same station had an agreement to premiere here-to-stay, the DJs pulled the sort of early broadcast.  The jocks believe more stations will be playing the Korn album as a result of their stunt.  Not yet.  Oh, yeah.  That's true, by the way.  And if you don't think, uh, Steve Kingston does that, we were, we were supposed to have Fred Durst on our show,  and we announced-  Uh-huh.  We were stupid enough to announce it ahead of time.  All of a sudden, he just doesn't show.  Oh, what happened?  Oh, I don't know.  I don't know.  Something came up.  Yeah, that's what happens.  That's why we can't announce anybody that's gonna come on.  That's why we didn't announce Seven Dust coming on. 
[00:21:30]  You know?  We, we can't.  We can't, uh, days in advance say, hey, be listening on this day because this guy or this band is coming in.  Because as soon as we announce something, the phones, uh, go crazy, and there's a lot of threatening going on.  Yeah.  He pulls out his phone book, not to look up numbers, but to pop on his seat so he could reach his phone.  And then he calls these people up, and, uh, before you know it, why are there so many midgets in our lives?  There are so many midgets in our lives. 
[00:22:00]  Boy.  This isn't the first time Opie and Anthony have jumped the gun with a new album.  He pulled a similar stunt with Stone Temple Pilots' latest Shangri-La-Di-Da.  And blah, blah, blah.  So, uh, you can read it for yourself on MTV.com.  Yeah.  That's pretty damn cool.  Yes.  We will continue doing this because our listeners are faithful and they will send us stuff.  It's called Leak and Release on the Opie and Anthony show.  Leak and release on us?  I said on the Opie and Anthony show.  All.  All right. 
[00:22:30]  Well, that's a little different.  If the the wasn't in there, that would have been a little rough, Anthony.  You can't, um, you can't stop it.  That's what it is.  There's no stopping it.  It's, uh, all over the internet.  What are you gonna do?  You're powerless.  Unless you want to be like Celine.  You know what she did?  Not harsh.  She don't do nothing.  She don't know crap.  Her people, the record company, Sony, by the way, made her new CD, her latest CD.  You cannot play it on a computer.  You know how you pop CD in your, uh, CD player on your computer and you could copy it that 
[00:23:00]  way and you can't play it.  It will make your computer crash.  Isn't that something?  That's, that's the latest rage though, Anthony.  Yeah.  But you know, there's ways around that too.  There's ways around that.  And once it gets downloaded, it's not like you need the CD and you're running copies  off of the CD.  You download it.  Then you make your own CD.  Celine.  Who cares?  Is anyone even buying that?  Do you know anyone that bought Celine? 
[00:23:30]  Well, your girlfriend probably bought Celine Dion.  What?  Celine Dion.  Do you know anyone that buys Celine Dion?  Celine, Sandy has every album.  I can play it in my camel toe.  They put these CD in their sideways and the delicate equipment in each bulbous bulb of  my camel toe.  Picks up the sound.  Sony does not like when people can play CDs with their franchisors. 
[00:24:00]  Wow.  This guy from New Orleans is really pissed off.  Tommy, what's up?  Why?  Tommy.  Hey, it's Bobby.  What's up?  Man.  Well, first I've got to tell you, Tom did beat you to the punch last week down here  in New Orleans.  Get out.  They played the entire Korn album last Wednesday, I believe it was.  Anyway, the album's awesome, but this sounds like New Orleans politics.  Be straight with me.  Are y'all leaving New Orleans or what? 
[00:24:30]  It is New Orleans.  One of the two stations dropping the show in the near future.  You'll have to wait and find out.  Oh.  All right.  Hey, Norton.  No, it ain't gonna work, bro.  Oh, you suck.  All right.  Uh, Drew, what's going on?  Hey, Opium.  How you doing, man?  Opium.  Opium.  Opium.  And Andone and Opium.  Opium and Andone.  Pleasure, pleasure for me.  Pleasure to be on your greatest station in the world.  It is pleasure for me to broadcast to the great city, Fag City, San Francisco. 
[00:25:00]  Pleasure for me.  Yeah, they've got a Fag Station out here, man.  I know they're gonna dump you.  Yeah.  I didn't know it.  Why?  Are there any signs on the station?  I don't see any signs anywhere.  I've had a while in my car since I started listening to you, like, a while back.  No, I mean, when I say, is there any signs?  Like, you're listening to the station and something just doesn't feel right with the  show.  Like, ooh, they're not playing enough commercials, you know, they're playing country music, which 
[00:25:30]  would give you a sign they don't care to fill up the space instead of playing commercial.  When you guys go to commercial, we have everything from, like, you know, The Supremes  to Celine Dion that plays.  Well, that would be a bad sign.  Wow.  Yeah, it's not a good thing.  Ugh.  All right.  All right, you guys stop, man.  Thank you, Drew.  Hey, did that guy ever write your back?  Oh, you got it?  Oh, he did?  Hold on.  What did he write?  I didn't say...  You should give this to Anthony.  I've been looking for it.  All right, hold on, hold on, hold on, because we've got to take a break here. 
[00:26:00]  What was his name again?  Joe.  Joe.  All right, hold on.  Oh, my God.  You guys don't think we read your instant feedbacks anymore?  I got hundreds to get through here.  All right, it's Joe from that city.  He is the only one that knows.  Yeah, Joe is the only one that knows, because I can see where he's from.  And he said, ring the bell if it's me.  And I rang the bell and asked him to write back, and now he wrote back.  He has the F word in capital letters with about five exclamation points. 
[00:26:30]  F.  I effing love you guys.  God damn it.  The F you line is going to be getting hit up real soon.  God damn, and then see the city.  He put the city there in capital letters.  God damn the city.  I'm moving too.  And then he puts another city that will continue broadcasting our show.  Ah?  Ah?  Oh?  Like that's a clue? 
[00:27:00]  I think it is.  It could be.  It could be a Cleveland Columbus thing.  I think you thinking it's a clue was more of a clue than the clue.  No, because our listeners aren't stupid.  You think they're stupid.  They're not stupid.  That was a clue, my friend.  He says he's going to move.  I'm thinking, what I'm thinking right off the bat, it's like Columbus is dropping the  show.  Look, I could play this game real well.  It could really be Columbus, but I'm not going to tell you.  Uh huh.  What you basically said in that email, it's something like it could be a Columbus.  Right.  And he's just going to move down the road to Cleveland to pick up the show. 
[00:27:30]  Or a Philly, New York thing.  Because they're close enough.  Mm-hmm.  Or a Philly to Washington.  Or a New York to Boston.  Mm-hmm.  Well, New York's not dropping the show.  I don't, uh, I don't know though, because you can move anywhere.  And he's saying, God damn, and then the name of the city, I'm moving to, and then another  city, could be anywhere.  But it makes it sound like he could just pick up and move no problem.  Oh!  Oh, really?  Like he doesn't have to get a moving company and a U-Haul and, you know what I mean?  He's got to walk there.  I'm thinking the guy could still keep his job. 
[00:28:00]  He's just got to kind of relocate around.  Oh, geez.  Two cities.  Uh-huh.  That's what I'm thinking.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's put it this way.  Let's say he works an hour outside of Philly.  Yeah.  South of Philly.  Mm-hmm.  Philly drops the show.  Yeah.  Which, by the way, ain't happening either.  Uh-huh.  So he moves an hour north of Philly.  Mm-hmm.  Maybe gets the O.P. and Anthony show through New York.  Right.  Still could go to work in Philly.  Same commute. 
[00:28:30]  Interesting.  I'm smart.  I'm smart.  I'm smart.  I was passed over.  All right.  We're just getting started.  It is Whipping Mount Wednesday.  We're getting closer and closer to having this thing explode.  Matt and Mary.  Opera Girl?  Yeah.  Opera Girl will be at Washington Square Park today heading out WOW stickers.  Opera Girl.  Mary's Opera Girl. 
[00:29:00]  What are you calling her now?  Dude, she was, what did she say?  Classically trained.  Classically trained for like eight years.  Why don't we have her come in and sing opera?  To sing some opera.  She does all the things.  Yeah, but that's on, you know.  This is her.  Get the Garrett one.  This is opera girl in the background.  Our Garrett is an awesome Garrett.  We should have her come in and just sing acapella.  Like that, what's her name? 
[00:29:30]  That fat little church kid.  What's her name?  Oh, Charlotte Church.  Charlotte Church.  She could be our little Charlotte Church.  Bring her in to sing.  Who's developing quite nicely.  She's not fat anymore, man.  No?  No.  Max?  Well, her boobs were developing real nice.  How old is she?  Fourteen?  No.  Stop.  I don't know.  Whatever.  Like we don't notice this stuff.  Sorry.  But now her butt is getting a little big too.  Is it?  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:30:00]  It's a shame.  Yeah.  Baby fat.  Well, she's going to have that perfect opera body.  Oh, the big fat bodies.  Okay.  Jim Norton is here.  Yes.  Thank you, Jim, for helping us out today.  Why don't we take a break and we'll go to the phones.  The phones have exploded.  I think we talked about ten different things here.  Yeah, I know.  What's going on today in just a bit.  Whip them out Wednesday.  Oh, man.  Funny bands go.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow. 
[00:30:30]  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  I love that.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  God smack.  I stand alone.  Anthony and I had to run into Steve's studio to record a commercial.  Oh, my God.  Tim Sabian, if you're listening to us right now, you better call this radio show.  Because I guess it's a friend of yours, Tim.  It certainly is.  Someone in Philly called up Tim because Tim, I think, is in Chicago today. 
[00:31:00]  Oh, is he in Chicago, the other city he handles now?  Well, he's helping our cause in Chicago.  He got the show pushed down.  Except for tonight because they had a stupid minor league hockey game.  Yeah.  So I guess they're hearing this in Chicago really late at night.  But we need Tim on the phone.  Anthony and I just did a commercial for SweetRelease.com.  Sweet Release.  You know what this is?  And Steve will be walking in with the raw audio. 
[00:31:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  I want to know who wrote this copy.  It could be the gayest copy ever.  Ever.  To have to be read by Opie and I.  It was so bad.  I think at one point they did imply that you know the taste of man juice.  It's commercial as it was supposed to be read.  And then they scratched out a couple of words to make it better. 
[00:32:00]  Yeah, they scratched it out going, oh, maybe this isn't a good idea.  Yeah, even they were like, wow, wait a minute.  Well, boy, thanks for looking after me.  Oh.  Lou, what's going on?  Lou?  Yeah.  Hey, what's up, Lou?  Hey, how you doing?  I just wanted to say, you guys, your show is so obviously gay at times, I can't imagine San Francisco not wanting to keep you around.  I want to say regularly it's chock full of man junk, helmet pinching action, free for all in San Francisco to enjoy it at least two to three times a week. 
[00:32:30]  Opie and Anthony, they're there for you.  Very good.  Thank you, Lou.  You're right, sir.  A lot of people guessing what stations are dropping the show in the air.  Yeah.  Michael is wondering something.  Michael?  Yeah.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I just heard your Hotwire commercial played on the air here.  Okay.  And you guys mentioned in there when you give an example of one of the fairs you mentioned from San Francisco to New Orleans.  And I'm thinking, is this like a Beatles hidden message or something?  Oh, thinking it's San Francisco and New Orleans? 
[00:33:00]  Yeah.  Hoping it's not Buffalo.  There you go.  Well, is Buffalo one of the cities there?  Is it?  I don't know.  We'll soon find out.  Thanks, Michael.  Thanks, guys.  Jeff from Philly.  Jeff, props to you.  Very funny.  Guy seems to be perceptive, Opie.  Yeah.  We have very funny listeners that help us out with this show on a daily basis.  Jeff writes, odds are being taken off the air.  He wrote a whole scenario here, Anthony.  There's the no chance category, according to Jeff from Philly.  The no chance category has New York, Philly, Chicago, Boston, and Washington. 
[00:33:30]  He has determined these to be the no chance they're the ones being dropped in the show.  They're all odds.  Yeah.  Basically saying, you know, no chance.  Not a chance.  Not a chance.  Okay.  Chance only because city is famous for losing category.  Cleveland, Buffalo, and Sacramento.  Oh.  What has Sacramento lost?  Hmm.  Some chance but will survive category. 
[00:34:00]  Austin, Texas, New Orleans, Las Vegas, Columbus, and Rochester.  The final four he's got it down to.  Portland, Seattle, San Francisco, and what he calls the Fredo of syndication, Dallas.  I'm smart.  How funny is that?  That's good, right?  Hey, Mike, he's banging cheerleaders two at a time. 
[00:34:30]  You goddamn guineas really make me laugh.  We have a great bit we want to do with mob movies.  We're just waiting for Lady Di and Mary to take a day off from work to help us out with something.  It's going to be hilarious.  We can't even get them to take the day off?  Isn't that odd?  Oh, they just put me off there.  Oh.  What, Opera Lady?  What?  Oh, hello.  What's up, Mary?  Hey, we're here with the Wow Men in Washington Square Park, right by the arch.  And the second we parked here, it started to torrentially downpour. 
[00:35:00]  Yeah, a little bit of rain happening.  Yeah, but if people want to get their Wow stickers today, that's where you guys are hanging, right?  Yep.  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you.  We should have Opera Lady do a little duet with Opera Man.  With Opera Man downstairs.  You know the guy that hands out the flyers and he's got a little tin cup?  That's a great idea.  That you're changing?  A little duet.  Wow.  Do you hear him screaming?  I like Opera.  Yeah, this guy nailed both cities. 
[00:35:30]  Let me see.  This guy nailed both cities.  Wow.  Look at that.  Very good.  All right.  Why don't we move on to other things here, finally.  Tony, you're next on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  What's up?  What do you say, Deke?  What's up?  Hey, nice head, Deke.  Nice show, Deke.  First of all, I want to say I'm psyched that I'm in No Chance, New York.  No chance.  No chance, New York.  That's what you got, like Vinnie Mack. 
[00:36:00]  Actually, I'm psyched because last night Jay Moore killed on ESPN.  Yeah, you know something?  Jay Moore's Moore Sports was on last night.  10 o'clock, was it?  Yeah, 10 o'clock.  Wait, no, because I did that and then Ozzy.  Yeah, 10 o'clock.  And what a good job.  Really funny.  He started the whole show with, okay, terrific.  Yeah, that was his first line there.  Okay, terrific.  He said off you guys a little bit too, man.  Like, when he was doing the Rulon Gardner eBay thing, I just kept thinking about, okay. 
[00:36:30]  Yeah, yeah.  We got a foot up.  We got a foot for sale.  Yeah, that's what I was thinking.  But the beginning, the opening scene, now Jay wanted us to do this.  He wanted us to fly out.  He was going to fly to LA and be the two guys that are massaging him.  As they pull the camera back, you see Jay's getting his massage and who is it?  His manager?  Barry. 
[00:37:00]  Barry.  Says, what are you doing?  He goes, I'm just getting a little massage before the show to relax by the ESPN masseuse.  And then Barry goes, there is no ESPN masseuse.  And Jay looks around like, what?  And the guy that's massaging him looks into the camera kind of and runs away.  Runs away.  Runs away.  They're massaging him.  He had those bony shoulders, man.  I mean, when you were talking about midgets before, when he was standing next to the jockeys,  he was about two inches taller than him.  I noticed that myself.  And Jay's not short.  No, I don't know what that was all about. 
[00:37:30]  I think the jockeys are getting a little bigger and taller these days.  A little taller.  But what was disturbing about the opening of More Sports, he went ahead and did the massage bit.  And a bunch of people have been calling and going, because they don't know what we look like.  They're like, for the love of God, please tell me that wasn't Opie or Anthony.  Because now the listeners are convinced one of us has decided last minute, like, alright, I'll do it.  No, no, that was just some guy there.  Opie's not going to do it, but I'll do it.  Or, you know, Ant's not going to do it, but I'll do it.  I know what it was with the jockeys.  They were like that deke across the street.  They had them on phone books. 
[00:38:00]  There you go.  Later, guys.  Thanks, Tony.  What was most disturbing, though, and I said he was going to do this.  I said it, and I'm so glad we weren't pressured into doing that bit.  I said he was going to moan, and what did he do?  He moaned right when the goddamn thing starts.  Hey, Rick, do you have the Jay Moore moan?  Yep.  He's doing the massage, and he goes, oh, and I said, I go, so, Jay, wait, what's going  to happen?  We're going to be massaging you, and you're going to go, oh, oh.  He goes, no, I'm not going to moan. 
[00:38:30]  And I'm tuning in.  The first thing I see is Jay moaning.  Right.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  But he did a great job last night.  Yeah, the show's funny.  It was nice.  When they went to the track, that was some funny stuff, man.  Yeah.  All right, here we go.  Rick's got it all set up now.  Want to start with the Jay Moan?  Yeah, let's listen to the Jay Moan.  All right.  From more sports last night on ESPN.  Oh, that is good stuff. 
[00:39:00]  You like that?  I love that.  Will you do my thighs?  Jay, what are you doing?  You have to get ready for the show.  Well, I'm a little nervous and tense, you know, so I thought I'd get a massage from  the ESPN studio masseuse.  Jay, we don't have a studio masseuse.  And that's where, you know, and that's where the guy ran out and Jay made a funny face  because this is Radio Inn. 
[00:39:30]  Dude.  Dude, that sounded like gay porno.  Stop it.  That sounded like gay porno.  Yeah.  Listen to the beginning.  Oh, that is good stuff.  You like that?  I love that.  Will you do my thighs?  Jay, what are you doing?  You have to get ready for the show.  Well, I'm a little nervous and tense, you know, so I thought I'd get a massage from the  ESPN studio masseuse.  Jay, we don't have a studio masseuse.  This never happened. 
[00:40:00]  And then he goes, this never happened.  Oh, that's good stuff.  Yeah, you like that?  Yeah.  Just the beginning part.  Oh, that is good stuff.  You like that?  I love that.  Will you do my thighs?  Jay, what are you doing?  You have to get ready for the show.  Right when he says that, that's enough.  I'm nervous and tense, you know, so I thought I'd get a massage from the ESPN studio masseuse.  Okay, I know.  How gay is that?  Oh, yeah, that's good.  Oh, that's good stuff.  I love that.  Will you do my thighs?  Jay, what are you doing?  You have to get ready for the show.  Right when he says that, that's enough.  I'm nervous and tense, you know, so I thought I'd get a massage from the ESPN studio masseuse. 
[00:40:30]  Okay.  We don't have a studio masseuse.  Hello?  Hi.  Yeah, I'm swinging the shoes.  How you guys doing?  How gay is that?  How gay is that?  Oh, yeah, that's good stuff.  Oh.  You like that?  Another man.  You like that?  Yeah, just do my thighs more.  Hello?  Hi.  You like that? 
[00:41:00]  Oh.  Hi.  You like that?  That's good stuff, huh?  Who else is it?  Hello?  Hello?  Hi.  Hi.  Welcome to the gay chat line.  A bell, you'll hear a bell ringing sound when someone new enters the chat.  Hi.  Hi.  What's your name?  Hello, who's that?  Hi.  My name's Jay.  I'm here with my masseuse.  Oh.  Oh, that's good.  You like that?  Yeah.  Hello?  How you guys doing?  Hi.  Who's this?  Tom?  I recognize your voice, Tom. 
[00:41:30]  Mmm.  How about Fresca?  Yeah.  You sound hot.  Hi.  Hi.  Hello?  Hi.  Who's this?  Suck it!  Oh, you're a French man.  I like it.  French.  So that's good.  Hello?  You dumb, Rube.  Yeah.  Yep.  Call me things.  I like that.  Hello?  Who are you?  I ain't calling you, lady.  No, I know.  You called the gay chat line.  Hello?  Who are you?  Who are you?  I ain't calling you, lady. 
[00:42:00]  No, I know.  You called the gay chat line.  Hello?  Who's this?  You know what I'm talking about when I said that, right?  Yeah.  Hi, Dice.  You want to suck it?  Tease my hair, fat boy.  Yeah, okay.  Talk dirty to me, French man.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You can act like a man.  Oh.  Yeah, hit me.  Virgin.  What's this?  The Iron Sheet?  Ah!  It's tough. 
[00:42:30]  Yeah, spit on me.  Degrade me.  Is that supposed to be sexy?  Yeah.  Who's this?  Anthony from the Opie and Anthony show?  Two girls for every boy.  Wow.  Hello?  Hey, everybody.  We're all gonna get laid!  Yeah.  I gotta leave. 
[00:43:00]  The gay chat line.  Wait, wait, wait, wait...  Ha-ha!  Do we have any more audio from Jay Shouts last night?  Yeah, we got a couple more.  First of all here is open.  Yeah, he had some really funny jokes on his monologue.  joke's on his monologue. Go ahead.  Okay, terrific!  Thank you very much,  everybody. Thanks a lot.  Welcome to my party.  Well, as we all know, fans in Maryland 
[00:43:30]  rioted last night to celebrate  the Terrapins' victory over the Hoosiers  while, see, that guy's  happy, while in  Bloomington, Indiana fans rioted  in anger over their team's loss.  I have never seen this many angry  white people in my life.  You'd think Dave Matthews  just announced his retirement.  Well, he's out there lighting  stuff on fire.  On fire!  Keep it sports-related. 
[00:44:00]  Magic Johnson, as we all know,  is thinking of running for mayor of  Los Angeles in the year 2005.  And...  They're clapping for that.  Yeah, go Magic.  In a related story, the city  of Los Angeles was just canceled.  Magic made the announcement  at the opening of one of his  Starbucks, America.  Huh?  Where else can a poor black man  become a multi-millionaire  and open a Starbucks in  South Central and charge other 
[00:44:30]  poor black men $4.50  cents for fucking coffee?  How about a nice bucket of eggs?  MROC wants credit.  There you go.  There's your credit, MROC.  You were right.  And just one more clip from  Jay's...  More sports on ESPN last night.  The Ladies Professional Golf  Association held a seminar to  teach the ladies how to make  women's golf more appealing.  And it looks like the seminar  worked this Sunday at a tournament.  Annika Sorensen was seen  working a ball washer 
[00:45:00]  with her mouth.  Iris, you're going to moan  and you can take that  to the parking lot.  How many jokes  did you write today?  He's such a smart ass.  He's such a smart ass  to the freaking audience.  Our buddy did very well last night.  He did.  Chris, what's going on?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, I just wanted to say  the joke's on the masseuse.  Jay's not gay.  Yeah, there you go.  There you have it.  Awesome, Garrett rules.  All right, we could have done  that a little bit. 
[00:45:30]  How about my thigh?  Hey, um, get my thigh.  Oh, oh, that's good stuff.  How about a nice bucket of AIDS?  Oh, that's good stuff, yeah.  Pleasure for me.  Pleasure for me to be  massaging it, uh, Jack.  Jim Moore.  Pleasure for me  to touch a naked man.  Uh, Tommy, what's up?  Yo, you know how  ESPN.com has the  10 burning questions?  ESPN.com has an interview 
[00:46:00]  with Jay Moore, yes.  Right, I'm going to read  you Jay's question.  They asked him,  if you could invite  any three people to dinner,  living or dead,  who would it be and why?  I'll get to the third guy  he would invite, Bono.  Bono was so cool,  you could have sex with him  and your friends  wouldn't even call you gay.  They'd be like,  so what's he like?  Uh, no, we'd call you gay.  Thank you.  Yeah, yeah.  Listen to you two,  I think you're gay.  We would definitely call him gay  and then ask him  how he was gay.  After the sex,  I mean, did you talk  about anything else?  As long as he's using  Sweet Release,  that product that makes 
[00:46:30]  his, uh,  his man batter  taste better.  I have the raw audio  in front of us.  Do you?  We will play the, uh,  the raw audio  of the Sweet Release  commercial.  Yeah.  We might have to get  Ken Stevens down here  for this.  I don't know.  He's got to be insane  to allow this  on the radio station.  Who wrote the copy?  I don't care if this company  wants to advertise  with our show.  Did he write it?  But, but who,  Jeff wrote this copy.  But who wrote off  on this and said,  yeah, this is fine. 
[00:47:00]  The guys would have  no problem reading this.  It really doesn't  suit our show.  The product, yeah.  But I mean,  this copy is,  how about a different angle  for the Sweet Release product?  Yeah, yeah,  a different angle.  One that doesn't, uh,  have me and Opie  talking at length  about man batter  and its flavor.  Right.  Perhaps that doesn't  really fit our personalities.  I think it fits a lot more  than you'd like to admit.  Not on the air.  And why don't they have  Jim, uh, read this?  Yeah. 
[00:47:30]  What makes you think  I don't want to read this?  It's just sexy  to hear you two do it.  All right, we'll play.  We'll play it next,  then, okay?  Yeah.  How old are you?  18.  All right,  what are you showed up?  Wow.  Fabulous!  Wow.  Holy ravioli!  Opie and Anthony.  This is the Opie and Anthony show.  It's Whip Them Out Wednesday.  Yes, it is.  Really fast.  We won't spend too much time  on this today.  Rich, what's up?  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Rich from Boston.  I put my sticker on yesterday  and it was comical 
[00:48:00]  because as you guys  were talking about,  I had two blondes  come up beside me  and they're whipping them out.  Oh.  And as you guys  were saying it,  I was looking,  I was like,  what are they doing?  And then I realized  I put the sticker on yesterday.  See, you forgot about it.  I can't,  I can't beat it.  See, man.  It's a great way  to start the season off.  You're a whimmer.  If you're skeptical,  you know,  what the hell,  just put a wow in your car  and see what happens.  You know what I'm saying?  Ain't gonna hurt.  Hey, uh.  I'm gonna keep the camera with me.  Hey, Rich,  are you going to BCN on Friday? 
[00:48:30]  We're broadcasting live,  three to seven.  I'm up in that area.  I will be.  It's always a party  outside the studio.  Oh, yeah.  We'll see you there in Boston.  Thanks, Rich.  You guys suck, Norm.  All right.  And you getting some weird  instant feedback there?  Yeah, just a little bit.  I gotta tell people,  I'll preface this.  Especially in New York,  especially in New York,  you're crazy to turn off  the show during commercials.  This is true.  There's so much going on.  Inside stuff.  Commercials for products  you don't even know  if to,  you think they're fake products. 
[00:49:00]  Because they're so stupid  you're thinking to yourself  they gotta be fake.  Well, we ran a spot for,  I'll just read some of these emails.  Todd from Jersey saying,  holy S,  was that real?  I thought the Playmate  of the Apes spot  was one of those  Grand Theft Auto 3 ads  that you hear  when you're playing the game.  Playmate of the Apes?  What the F is that?  I can't believe you guys  don't have a clip of it already.  Did I just hear a spot  for Playmate of the Apes? 
[00:49:30]  Damn you.  That was the funniest spot yet.  Who sells this crap?  Frank.  And Dale from Jersey saying,  Playmate of the Apes,  has Earl been cast yet?  Oh.  Now that's...  Hey.  He's back at his desk.  Oh, Earl, Earl.  Our Earl is a lazy Earl.  Oh, God.  He is so pissed.  He's disassociated himself  with this very program.  You will not hear him  on this show anymore.  He doesn't want to be involved  with the Opie and Anthony show.  He's the only one 
[00:50:00]  that hangs out with us  that can't take a joke.  Yeah, that seems to be  what it is.  And I talked to him  over the weekend.  I was explaining,  you know, I go,  do you realize Ant  for like two or three  straight days  was just getting killed  by myself and Jim  and the rest of the gang here  and the listeners  and then some feedback  and the papers  and he took it like a man.  I understand you've got to  get in the barrel  every so often.  I'm like,  what is your problem, Earl?  You're the only one  that can't take a joke.  You want to hear the spot  for Playmates of, 
[00:50:30]  what is it called?  Playmate of the Apes,  like Planet of the Apes,  only with chicks.  And I guess they have  all kinds of sexual hijinks  going on, Opie.  I haven't screened it yet.  All right,  and then we'll play  the sweet release  of raw audio.  A visionary achievement  that will change  the face of erotic cinema.  How did this monkey  get like this?  Who's out of it?  Oh, actually,  that feels pretty good.  Seduction Cinema  is proud to announce  the home video  and DVD release 
[00:51:00]  of Playmate of the Apes,  an ultra-erotic  sci-fi adventure  that takes you  deep into  the forbidden zone.  Oh, my God.  Deep into  the forbidden zone.  I get it.  Damn you,  I'm going  into the forbidden zone.  Hmm,  smells like trout.  No wonder  Dr. Zayas  told us  to stay away.  Ew,  look at the swords  on it.  Damn you  all to hell.  I'm, 
[00:51:30]  I'm suddenly drawn  to the forbidden zone.  And it's giving me  a boner.  Damn you  all to hell.  Dr. Zayas,  I'm going to tie you up  and go to the forbidden zone.  I taught your  veg to smile.  Nova.  Nova.  That is the  helliest forbidden zone  I've ever seen.  Jesus.  They like,  they don't shave  because they're like  the apes on our planet. 
[00:52:00]  Damn you  all to hell.  Playmate of the apes.  Suck it.  You filthy whore.  This thunderclap  doesn't work anymore.  Ah.  Bye-bye.  Let me hear more  of Playmate of the Apes.  They took it out.  They did.  We were only  halfway done with it,  weren't we?  Yeah.  Did you fast forward it?  Damn you, Ben. 
[00:52:30]  They were just  getting the forbidden zone part.  Now we're in the  forbidden zone.  Let's continue.  It's not blowing  like a baboon's,  is it?  A well-endowed  landscape of luxurious  lesbian pleasures  from which there is  no return.  From those same  primates who brought  you the erotic  witch project  and gladiator eroticus,  Playmate of the Apes  features the beautiful  Misty Munday  doing her best  Charlton Heston impression  as fearless  United States  astronaut Gaylor,  a sultry  lesbian space explorer.  I want to get out of  this madhouse. 
[00:53:00]  This is a madhouse!  Playmate of the Apes  and other  Seduction Cinema titles  are available  at fine retailers  near you  or visit them  on the world  wide web  at  seductioncinema.com.  You're right.  At the end,  it seems like it should be  Play Grand Theft  Dodo 3  from Rockstar Games.  Oh my God,  I want to see that now.  This is a madhouse!  A madhouse!  A madhouse!  And you know she's just  jumping around with her cans  flapping in her bush. 
[00:53:30]  Rick,  can you get us some audio  from Playmates of the Night?  Oh, yeah.  God,  do we need that.  Sooner than later,  I think we need to hear more.  Rick,  I think if  if I thought  it was going to take  any longer than  the first five minutes  to hear hysterical dialogue,  I'd say wait.  But I know you could  probably just pop that in  and get some clips.  John,  what's going on?  Hey,  how are you doing,  guys?  All right,  what's up?  Yeah,  I was a production  assistant on that.  You were?  Yeah.  And?  Just interesting watching.  It was the first time  I worked on something like that. 
[00:54:00]  Yeah,  what did you have to do?  I was the guy  who went to get lunch.  Any,  you know,  the crap work.  I was in it,  too,  briefly.  You were?  Yeah.  What was your part  in Playmates of the Apes?  I played two different  apes.  The guy that gets  the coffee and stuff  is in it.  One,  I was chasing girls  with a net  and had to capture  them in the ape suit.  More movie work  than Voss ever got.  Voss got cut  from the Colin Quinn show 
[00:54:30]  and this guy's  fetching coffee  and getting porno jobs.  The second one,  I was like a guard  and then I was  a scarecrow  at the end.  A scarecrow  at the end.  How funny  is this movie  and is it supposed  to be funny?  It's totally  a comedy.  Is it hardcore  sex dude?  No,  it's all softcore.  I think we had  one of the actresses  on it.  You had Darian.  Darian.  Darian's in it,  yeah.  Because she did  the Blair Witch  project thing.  Yeah,  right,  erotic witch.  And Terry West  is in it,  too.  Terry West, 
[00:55:00]  who called you  about the  I See Dead  strippers,  he's in it.  Yeah,  okay.  Well,  thank you,  bro.  We're going to  get more audio  on the show  later.  Sure,  I'll bring it  in for you  sometime if you'd  like.  Oh,  we have a copy.  John,  we got about  20 copies.  Oh,  you did?  Okay.  And,  well,  we're very honest  on the show.  We threw them  all in the garbage.  Oh,  so now we've got  to find one  so we can get  the audio  on the radio.  If you want me  to bring it in,  I can bring it  in next week.  All right.  I can swear  I saw a few  still back there.  All right,  thank you,  John.  Sure.  Ixnay on the  Uthray M. 
[00:55:30]  They O.J.  A-way.  Matt,  that was just a bit.  Don't worry.  Oh,  that looks hot.  What?  Look at that.  Yeah.  Hey,  there's something  you see every day.  A little dumper  sniffing.  Very nice.  Yeah.  All right,  well,  yeah,  that's a real  commercial for  the O.P.  and Anthony  show here in  New York.  And,  yeah,  we just did  the audio  for another  commercial  that'll be  airing soon.  Isn't work  Earl's  Forbidden Zone?  That's from  Seed Sprinkler  in Buffalo. 
[00:56:00]  Our Earl  is a lazy Earl.  All right.  Well,  here's the  sweet release  raw audio.  I think this  is the only  time you will  hear this  commercial  in this form.  Uh-huh.  It's the long  form before  Steve gets  to cut it  apart.  Can we get  Ken Stevens  on the phone?  Super GM  Ken Stevens?  Super GM.  You want him 
[00:56:30]  on the phone  or in the  studio,  Anthony?  In the studio  it would be  better to look  at him  as this is  a...  Because he  had to  give the  okay on  this spot.  Oh,  yeah,  he had to  write a  sign off  on it  and just  looking at  the first  line,  I would  say,  do you  really think  the guys  would talk  to each  other like  this?  Well,  why don't we  play it?  You know,  they want to  get...  the thing  is,  everybody  that  advertises  on the  Opie and  Anthony  show,  their dream  is to  have their  product  presented  on this 
[00:57:00]  program  like we  present  Sam Adams,  stacker two,  things like that.  A product that we  could really get  be right.  That we  just...  When we  talk about  it,  it's very  conversational.  Yeah.  But believe  me,  the people at  Sam Adams  don't write  a conversation  between me  and Opie  or anyone  else to  talk about  the product.  This one,  they have a  script.  O,  A,  O,  and all the  lines where  Opie's supposed  to say. 
[00:57:30]  We don't work  like that.  We don't read  scripts for  commercials.  What's wrong,  Ben?  He's not around?  No,  he's not here.  His office is  shut.  Oh,  really?  Get Jeremy  to get him  on his cell  phone.  This is  very important.  I did see  Melissa last  night.  So she's  probably in  town.  She's probably  in town and  Ken's gone.  Okay,  enough said.  All right,  here we go.  Here's the raw  idea,  Anthony.  This is the  live read for  SweetRelease.com.  Opie says,  Hey,  Ant,  let's talk  S-E-X. 
[00:58:00]  Nice.  That's my line.  I'm reading  along as it's  playing.  I say,  Hey,  Ant,  let's talk  S-E-X.  And then I say,  nice,  with six  exclamation points  behind it.  Like,  I'm so excited.  That means they  really want you to  emphasize that nice.  Just boys being  boys talking sex.  So they're sitting  writing this going,  okay,  Opie says to  Anthony,  let's talk about  sex.  And Anthony's so  thrilled at the  thought of speaking  about sex with  Opie that he says, 
[00:58:30]  so excited that I  had to type five  exclamation points  behind it.  He says,  nice.  Not nice.  Nice.  At this point,  Anthony unzips his  fly and starts  cranking his meat  to the point of  bleeding.  The only thing  that could make  this worse is if  after he said,  let's talk S-E-X,  you said,  and it's a  portable phone.  Stop trying to  capture the show  in your writing,  you dumb faggot  businessmen.  Here's some more  of the raw audio 
[00:59:00]  for our new  sponsor.  I've just said  nice.  You've just said  nice.  My line's coming  up now.  Fag!  See,  that was me  reacting to  it's nice.  I don't think  that was  in the copy.  Well,  no,  and it was  very faggy,  so I figured  that was  appropriate there.  All right,  here comes my  next line,  I think.  Opie says,  for years we've  been telling you  about a product  that makes  sex safer  and products  that help  you perform  better.  Well,  and how... 
[00:59:30]  What?  Oh,  Ant.  Now gets that.  Oh.  Well,  Ant,  now get set.  Here comes the  ultimate,  a product that  makes S-E-X  more incredible.  Wow!  It's called  Sweet Release.  Imagine enjoying  the most intimate  acts knowing a  sweet,  delicious taste  and scent  is coming  from you!  Coming from  within!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  I gotta be  honest here.  Yeah. 
[01:00:00]  They give us  these scripts  during commercials  and we don't  pre-read them.  No,  I was...  So I'm just  going along  like,  okay,  well,  this was approved  by someone,  I'll just read it  and then as I'm  reading I'm  realizing it's  getting faggier  and faggier.  The scent  is coming from  you,  coming from  within you.  Within me.  Ah!  What they don't  realize is that  these scents  and these little  flavors,  part of the beauty  in receiving treats  is knowing  that it's an  awful bleachy  mess they're  going to wind  up with.  Ah!  That's part  of the joy 
[01:00:30]  of it.  I don't know.  Some people  are upset  by that  and want a  product that  can make it  a little more  attractive.  You know  who this is  for?  This is for  guys who  are married  to wives  with fat  backs  who won't  suck anymore  because they're  tucking their  stretchy pants  into their  white socks.  That's what  this is for.  Hey,  look,  it tastes  like lemonade  fat.  So good.  It tastes  like a pork  chop.  You know what  works just as well  as this picking  up a hammer  and threatening  her.  Well,  let's continue.  All right.  Back to the 
[01:01:00]  script here.  Ant says,  Hey,  the female  formula is a  delicious,  soft,  citrus flavor.  Nice save.  Opie says,  I'm told.  Holy  I ain't reading  this.  No way  is this line  going to be  on the radio  for me.  It says,  Opie says,  I'm told  the men's  formula is  the taste  and scent  of a wonderful  crisp hard 
[01:01:30]  apple.  Look at what  it was supposed  to,  you were supposed  to read  that scratched  out.  It says,  I'm told,  but it says,  and,  and,  the men's  formula is  that tastes  like you  knew.  It's called  sweet release  and quite  simply,  Opie,  it adds  the scent  of succulent  fruit to  pleasure.  Yeah,  somebody  actually read  through this  and then got  to your  line that  said, 
[01:02:00]  an ant,  the men's  formula is  the taste  and scent  of a  wonderful  crisp hard  apple and  said,  hmm,  I think I  better scratch  out the  end ant  part and put,  I'm told.  I'm told.  Which just  makes me  sound like  I'm covering  up my  gayness.  Now,  instead of  knowing,  my friend  says,  my good  friend says,  let's say  you had a  friend that  tasted this.  I have a  friend that  told me,  yeah,  whispered it  behind my  ear as my  face was in  the pillow. 
[01:02:30]  Rewrite,  rewrite,  Opie says,  Sweet Release  is available  for ordering  right now,  $29.95 plus  shipping and  handling for  a 30-day supply  of the life  changing supplement.

[01:03:00]  there you go.  It just  doesn't,  it doesn't  fit.  Yeah,  yeah.  Try,  try again.  That's another  way you check  if your girl  is cheating  on you  if she has  apple breath.  Not just  any apple,  what is it,  a hard  apple,  crisp,  hard apple,  crisp,  hard apple,  crisp,  hard apple,  hard red  delicious apple.  Your girl  gets home  late,  you kiss  her.  Your breath  tastes like  a crisp  hard apple, 
[01:03:30]  hon.  Drinking schnapps?  Well,  not really.  Could say  that,  he was  German.  Gay Marco.  I think  Sweet Ridley's  would make  an excellent  sponsor for  the Gay Marco  Alternative  Lifestyle  Radio Show.  Part 2.  Oh,  jeez,  I don't want  to get the AIDS,  fellas.  Are we doing  Part 2 with you?  I'd love to.  You stupid  faggot.  So,  you like the  Sweet Release  thing?  I want to  sample it for you.  How about  a nice bucket  of AIDS? 
[01:04:00]  Oh,  come on.  You've got  some funky  tasting spunk.  So,  have you gotten  any ideas  together for  your radio  show?  I have  lots of  ideas.  Yep.  I have  lots of  ideas.  Like?  Like,  like,  um,  I have  lots of  ideas.  Yeah,  like none.  I have  tons of  ideas.  Howdy,  faggot.  Give us  one idea  you're going  to do  on your  radio  show.  Give  you one  idea.  Um,  we're going  to do  Gay Marco 
[01:04:30]  Match  Game.  Friggin'  fag,  you want  to make  out or  something?  It's  been done  already.  What?  Yeah,  it was  put in  some  science  fiction  movie.  Yeah.  All right,  Marco,  keep working  on it.  Oh,  come on.  Yes,  keep  in  voice.  Hey,  I'll be  in with  my stuff.  What are  you,  gay?  Next  week,  I'll be  in with  my stuff.  Maybe  Gay Marco  should do  the mobster 
[01:05:00]  bit.  Okay,  here's another  idea I have.  Gay Marco  Marion doing  it.  That could  be funny.  That could  be good.  It would  not be  funny.  Hold on,  there's some  hotness on  the line  here.  Oh,  we haven't  talked to  hotness in  a while.  Turn the  radio down,  please.  Dr.  Allison.  Yes,  hi.  From  Temptation  Island.  How are  you?  The hot  doctor,  the brunette,  gorgeous.  You helped  us out with  what the hell  is that?  Yeah,  that was  fun. 
[01:05:30]  And you're  listening to  our show  today?  Yeah,  I didn't get  to see that  twatto though.  No,  you didn't.  I missed twatto,  yeah,  maybe another  time.  I had to  leave,  I had to  go to  work.  That's  right,  you left  early.  Yeah.  So why  are you  calling us  today?  Oh,  because I  heard it all  the time,  and like,  in my  medical opinion,  it's just  absolutely  horrible.  You don't  like the way  it tastes?  No,  but I think  if it was  great,  men would  just like  eat it  themselves and  they wouldn't  share it,  you know?  Oh yeah, 
[01:06:00]  that's  happening.  Yeah,  well,  I mean,  if it was,  because all,  you know,  like the poor  people.  At home,  watching the  Osbournes,  and just like  we're scraping  pudding out of a  bowl.  Well,  I could get up,  go to the  fridge and get  some pudding,  but why bother?  I got it right  here.  I could just  arch my back.  Yeah,  why not?  So,  you don't  enjoy that?  Well,  the poor,  you know,  the poor people  always act like  they like to  eat it or  something,  and there's  no way. 
[01:06:30]  No?  No.  You're a  doctor.  That's the  difference.  You make a  really good  living.  That's why  we don't  date doctors.  We look  for runaways.  Wow,  you're not  a good girl  then.  Yeah,  but no,  I mean,  you know,  you probably  pretend like  you like it.  Oh,  you do it,  but you fake it.  It's really  just bad,  though.  I mean,  you know,  otherwise you  just ask for  like a bowl  full of it  or something,  but you know.  Well,  in small doses,  you've got to  take it there.  I mean,  it has some  protein in it,  but you know, 
[01:07:00]  I mean,  you can get that  from tofu,  I guess.  Well,  maybe this product  is going to  help some ladies  out there.  Maybe.  And you know  what?  You're actually  making a good  point for me  because a lot  of women don't  like the taste.  That's the beauty  of having your  hair grabbed  and taking it  all over the face.  Yeah,  I mean,  you want it  anywhere but  in your mouth.  You don't want  them to like it.  You don't have  to taste it.  You don't have  to taste it.  That's good.  That's a good  point.  Yeah.  All right.  So you're not  into that?  No,  no,  no,  not exactly. 
[01:07:30]  But I think  all guys think  that it must  taste good.  Now,  you know it  doesn't.  We don't care.  All right,  here's my theory.  We don't care.  You don't want it  on their hands.  No,  I'm sick.  My friends rarely  will admit it,  but you have to  have accidentally  taste the girl  at one point.  I've actually  dolloped it out  of my belly  and sniffed it.  I've got chili  on my hand.  It's had to have  happened.  I'm sure every guy  knows how bad  it tastes.  They all know.  They're just lying  if they don't. 
[01:08:00]  I've tasted it.  You get on your  hands.  You accidentally  lick your finger.  Hold on,  hold on.  Hold on now.  Hold on.  Jim,  you've what?  Tasted it.  Not like out of  a spoon,  but like if I'm  with a young lady,  I'll tell you what,  will you get a hold  of yourself over there,  Sam Screamish?  I'm telling you.  How are we going to get a hold  of ourselves?  Let's say a girl  takes care of things  and, you know,  I'll kiss her after.  I don't care.  For a second.  Big deal.  You're a trooper.  I'll be a trooper.  Now get in there 
[01:08:30]  and freshen up sleeves.  How long after?  I don't care.  As soon as I'm like,  ugh.  Yeah, how?  Give me a kiss.  Boom.  Go brush your teeth.  I don't care.  It's mine.  It's mine.  Not enough time has elapsed.  It doesn't bother me.  You'll need a whole weekend  to elapse.  Dude, it's mine.  I don't care.  It's mine.  It's fine.  Look, I don't mind her  giving me yellow  popcorn-y loveliness.  I'm not going to mind  tasting that.  Bobby from Queens,  isn't this Rick's  area of expertise?  I think we did have  a discussion with Rick 
[01:09:00]  about this.  It is odd.  After I kissed a girl,  I just hopped into a Miata.  Oh.  Hey, Dr. Allison.  Yeah.  You hot piece of ass.  We're going to talk about  the five biggest sex mistakes.  The five biggest sex mistakes?  Yeah, and this is  a bunch of women.  Through all things  that men do wrong, right?  Yeah, what do you think  is obvious?  Women don't ever do  anything wrong.  Well, no, this is just  from the female point of view.  What do men do wrong?  Yeah, in your opinion. 
[01:09:30]  Yeah, they don't do  foreplay enough.  They don't do the  foreplay enough?  Yeah, foreplay,  that's a big thing.  Here's a bad one.  It's just like  watching porn  and not looking at  your girlfriend  while you're having sex.  Like, that would be  a bad thing.  Well, I would think so.  Yeah, I mean,  at least pretend  like she's there.  Hey, Dr. Allison.  Dr. Allison.  Have you been drinking?  Another one would be  when they pretend...  Dr. Allison.  Dr. Allison,  listen to me.  Have you been drinking today?  I have not been drinking today. 
[01:10:00]  I'm driving in a car  with three men  and one of them  is from the Bloodhound Gang.  He's a bit of a naughty,  dirty boy here,  a pig.  I hear Evil Jared  is in the car with you.  Yeah, Evil Jared  is in the car with me.  They're going out to LA.  Cool.  So, we're getting rid of him  for a little bit here.  All right.  You know what I mean?  Go ahead.  One more thing  that guys do wrong.  What's another bad thing?  One men pretend  that they just don't know  the female anatomy  and they're like,  you know,  poking around  and they pretend  like they've got 
[01:10:30]  the right...  Oh, I didn't know  that was your butt.  Oh, I thought  that was something  that was your butt.  Oh, I got it.  Yeah, I got it.  Wait, wait.  They all know  but that's just like  some...  That's just some...  Every guy...  Hold on, hold on  because they probably  dumped out  because you used  a little too much  of the word  but you're saying  that guys will pretend  they don't know  that it's the balloon nut  when they're slamming it home.  Right, right.  Now that I can't...  So they're trying  to get away with something  and they go,  oh, I'm sorry.  I did not...  Yeah, now that's just a dumb... 
[01:11:00]  I mean, just ask for it.  You know, like don't just  like pretend like...  Just ask for it.  Oh, you don't know  the female anatomy.  Right.  It is a difference there.  You know?  When you're doing it  you're actually thinking  look, if neither one of us  mentions this...  Right, right.  Just don't talk about it.  Yeah.  So, you know,  those are three things there.  Three no-nos.  What else?  It's like sneaking past  Checkpoint Charlie, you know?  You just go in  and what do you do?  You're going to stop  and ask the guard?  Can I go through?  You keep walking  and hope they don't 
[01:11:30]  ask you questions.  You don't ask them nothing  and you hope to make it through.  I find the biggest mistake  that most men make after sex  is digging a grave  that's too shallow.  Not weighing down enough  so it stays under the water.  Those pesky raccoons.  Yeah.  So, you know,  men are...  I know you know anatomy  better than that.  All right, Dr. Allison.  Yeah.  We'll get into  the five mistakes  that a lot of men make.  Yeah, why not?  Because Dr. Allison,  she doesn't shut up, Opie.  I like Dr. Allison. 
[01:12:00]  Dr. Allison,  you know,  if you weren't so hot,  we would have hung up  on you five minutes ago, right?  Yeah.  Oh, really?  Oh, that's horrible.  Dr. Allison,  what does evil Jared taste like?  What does evil Jared taste like?  Not unlike other men.  Oh, my gosh.  I hope my parents aren't listening.  Oh, my gosh.  It all pretty much is.  No more evil.  His seed is not really  any more evil  than anybody else  I would say.  No, it's not.  All right.  Now, I did...  I have heard some guys 
[01:12:30]  that have this theory  that if they eat more fruit,  it would taste better.  Yeah?  But, you know,  because of the fruit...  But I've never heard...  The fruits they're eating  are homosexuals  down in the village.  I don't know.  It doesn't make it taste...  It doesn't make it taste any better.  ...in the journals about that.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't know  if that's really true.  All right, Dr. Allison.  All right.  Thank you.  So, that's my...  That's my advice  out there to men.  Give us a call soon, all right?  All right.  I will.  All right.  Bye.  Oh, wait a minute.  What? 
[01:13:00]  You got it.  Beautiful.  A lot of people saying...  Well, Ernie,  I was saying Dr. Allison  sounds like...  You got it, Mule?  Sounds like...  Steve-O's girlfriend?  Steve-O's girlfriend.  Dr. Allison is...  Beautiful.  Way hotter than Steve-O's girlfriend.  She was on that goddamn...  Steve-O's girlfriend was pretty hot.  ...Temptation Island.  She was on the first Temptation Island.  Remember that show, Temptation Island?  She was the one that went on the little getaway at the end of the show in that cave with Kaya.  The water cave with Kaya.  They had the best shot of her getting out of the water in slow motion as she was flipping 
[01:13:30]  her long brown hair.  Yeah.  In a tiny little bikini.  It was almost a Phoebe Cates moment.  It kind of was.  Get out of the pool.  Very similar.  You see something like that and you just want to...  Oh, look at Jim's pinching his fat, feeling all bad about himself.  You know what I'm saying, though.  Those...  When you see girls on TV, sometimes they're not even...  It's sexy, but they're depressing.  It really is.  You see a hot girl once in a while on TV and you're like, you know what, man?  I'm just...  It's awful.  Everything is awful.  You really do think...  Not feeling good.  No.  Do you ever get that way when you see a bikini-clad chick? 
[01:14:00]  Like, I could never be on the beach and talk to her.  Eh.  You don't think about it.  All right.  You've got to move on with your life.  Love yourself, Jim.  No, no, no.  I don't mean just me.  I'm saying guys and...  Taste yourself.  Hey, um...  I could go for an apple.  Should we have the ladies try to guess the five biggest sex mistakes that men are doing?  That's a good idea.  To them?  Yeah.  Very good idea.  You know, I had an instant feedback here, but I lost it.  Somebody saying that you were complaining about that spot where you're saying, I'm not going  to say that line. 
[01:14:30]  I'm not going to say that.  You sounded like, I'm not saying that.  Crisp crumb coating.  Crisp crumb coating.  It doesn't roll off the tongue.  Why?  I did it right the first time.  Crisp crumb coating.  Crisp apple.  Crisp hard apple.  Crisp hard apple.  I won't say that.  Crisp crumb coating.  Crisp crumb coating.  All right.  We'll get some ladies on the line next, okay?  You're right.  And we also have to talk about the Osbournes.  Yes.  Ozzy calling in once again today, hopefully in a little while.  The Osbournes last night, just off the hook funny. 
[01:15:00]  Great show.  And they interviewed us, the Daily News, about the show.  Yeah, for some reason.  I don't know.  Maybe it'll appear in the paper tomorrow.  We'll see.  Who knows?  Look at us getting press.  Hey, how about that?  Thanks for calling, and here's the Opie and Anthony F.U. line.  Hey, this is Eric from Massachusetts.  This big, sloppy, nasty F.U.  goes out to all those bandwagoning Patriot fans.  F.U.  You and your little frickin' Patriot hats fresh out of the store with the tags still on it. 
[01:15:30]  We're all real P.A.D. fans in Massachusetts, you stupid pricks.  Go f*** yourself.  Next message.  Yeah, I just leave a big f*** you to my ex-wife for the day I moved out and somebody else move in and put all my clothes in the backyard and everything got soaking wet.  F.U., you cheap-ass bitch.  F.U.  Next message.  Hi, I'd like to send a f*** you out to my parents for playing f***ing favorites between me and my brother.  They're so enough that they don't notice my brother smoking weed and fencing stolen property, but they give me crap for going online and looking at porn. 
[01:16:00]  Whatever.  F.U.  Next message.  I want to give a gigantic, all-encompassing F.U. to last night for living with a f***ing hangover and a gigantic wealth in the middle of my forehead.  But at least I'm not from Boston with your dumb accents and your mullets.  Where to blow and lead, you stupid twat.  Don't talk.  End of message.  The Opie and Anthony F.U. line is there for you when life sucks.  Sucks to be me.  Call anytime.  212-830-3785. 
[01:16:30]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  1027 WNEW.  Yo.  Yo.  Anthony, lots going on in the show today.  Yes.  We do have audio from Playmate.  Playmate of the Apes.  Playmate of the Apes.  Rick's been getting some audio from Playmate of the Apes, and it's funnier than you could have imagined. 
[01:17:00]  I can't wait.  That's coming up in a little bit.  Top five mistakes guys make in bed.  The lady's going to call up and help us with that.  Going to give you nasty guys an education.  Got to satisfy your women.  And this is right from the chick's mouth, right?  That's right.  We still got to talk about the Osbournes last night.  Yeah.  Tiana Tom calling in at five.  She's in the latest issue of Playboy.  From that Flex Appeal show.  Right.  The chinky one. 
[01:17:30]  Hey, hey, he's in there.  I think she's Hawaiian or something.  She's of some Asian descent, though.  She's beautiful.  But right now, let's go to the phone and talk to Jay Moore.  Ladies and gentlemen, how are you?  Jay Moore.  Before we start making fun of you, let me just start by saying, what a great show last  night, my friend.  Abso-effing-lutely.  It was funny.  You did a great job.  Jay Moore, more sports.  The pacing was nice. 
[01:18:00]  You got a little music.  You got a little monologue.  I think most importantly, it was the first thing I ever said on the show.  I know.  I was thinking that.  Okay.  Terrific.  First words ever spoken on my show.  Hey, Jay, is it a daily show or a weekly?  I don't even know.  It's a weekly show.  Cool.  Cool.  He can't do that every night.  If it was a daily show, it certainly wouldn't be funny.  Very, very funny, man.  When you went to the track, that whole thing was fantastic.  What do I do?  Rip up the ticket?  No, no, you don't rip up. 
[01:18:30]  What are you doing?  When we left, there was like a 95-year-old black guy that we passed.  We didn't get him on camera, but the guy just looks up and he just looked brokenhearted  and he goes, the black guy in the piece, his name is Little Red.  Yeah.  And he just goes, Little Red, always get the luck.  I was like, where were you when the cameras were rolling, buddy?  The guy choked.  Why are you going to make fun of me, Opie?  Well, Jay, Ant and I are very glad that we're getting into the open with you. 
[01:19:00]  The opening sequence.  Hi, you, Ryan.  I swear to you.  This is how gay it looked to all of us and our listeners.  Of course it looked gay.  It's gay.  Wait, wait, wait.  We're going to look gay.  It's gay, he says.  We get on the air at three.  The phones explode and everyone is going, please, for the love of God, tell me you didn't  decide last minute to fly out to Hollywood and film the open for more sports because they  don't, a lot of people obviously don't know what we look like.  So they're thinking like that could be me or Anthony. 
[01:19:30]  And last minute we said, ah, what the hell, let's do it.  It's our pal, Jay.  I'll give Jay a little rub.  This was Anthony.  Yeah, we'll give Jay a little rub.  And you moaned, man.  You lying sack.  You moaned.  You told us you wouldn't moan, Jay.  You said, I'm not going to moan.  But the first thing you do is, oh, that's good stuff.  I will say it was gay from its inception, the idea.  When we played the clip, because we have the clip of that, we played it.  And the first two or three lines with the music and you talking to the masseuse and him 
[01:20:00]  answering you could be gay porno.  There is no distinguishing it.  Oh, that's good stuff.  You're like, oh, and he's like, oh, you like that?  If I'm going to do something that is gay overtones, I like it a bit.  I didn't see it, dude.  Can't use the M word.  They don't like that word.  Oh, really?  I didn't see it, but the audio is very good.  Yeah, very, very gay, Jay. 
[01:20:30]  I thought if I was going to do something gay, the bar I set for myself is I would like Jim  Norton to be able to punch his clown to it.  There you go.  Very good.  There you go.  Hey, let's go to the audio.  I didn't open with that.  That's funnier than the other word anyway.  Hey, kids, let's go to the audio.  And then see our pal Jay on more sports.  This is how it all began last night.  Oh, that is good stuff.  You like that?  I love that.  Will you do my fives?  Jay, what are you doing?  You have to get ready for the show.  Well, I'm a little nervous and tense, you know, so I thought I'd get a massage from the ESPN 
[01:21:00]  studio masseuse.  Jay, we don't have a studio masseuse.  I love the music, man.  It's gay porno.  Oh, I like it.  I'm telling you, it sounds gay because it's really gay.  What are you, gay?  When you say that, oh, that's good stuff.  Oh, you like that?  Yeah.  Get my thigh.  Get my nut sack.  You know, I would kill to be on ESPN, my friend, but we made the correct decision on this 
[01:21:30]  one.  I think we did.  When I asked you guys to do it, it made me laugh so hard, the idea.  I mean, it was funny.  I mean, we know it's funny.  But I think I was laughing the same reason you were laughing, Opie, in retrospect, is  that I was actually asking good friends of mine to be that gay on television.  But it was a little guilty pleasure.  And if I ask, hey, the worst that happens is you say no. 
[01:22:00]  No, actually, the worst that happens is you say yes and you play a gay masseuse.  Yeah, that's the worst.  You know, we're making fun of you, but I got to say, the bit worked.  The bit absolutely worked.  It worked, you know.  I knew it.  Hey, here's more audio from the masseuse from last night.  Oh, it's all gooey.  Wait, wait.  More audio from the masseuse last night.  Oh, jeez.  I don't want to get the H, fellas.  Again. 
[01:22:30]  You don't want to get it again.  At one time, I think at some point, Barry turned around to the masseuse and smacked him.  Oh, really?  Yeah, you see, I think we have audio from that.  Oh, yeah, play that.  You can act like a man.  What's the matter with you?  When you asked me who was going to play the masseuse, I just said the gayest looking writer we have.  Here's audio of the masseuse when Jay Moore rolled over onto his back.  Red rocket, red rocket.  Oh, I never heard that.  You made my day just with that. 
[01:23:00]  What was Dice doing there?  Look what he's doing now.  It's what I do.  It's all I do.  You know what I'm talking about when I said that, right?  What do you think, are you stupid?  It's what you're...  What did I do?  It's what you're...  Oh, wait, wait.  Jay can't hear that.  Oh, I'm sorry.  You couldn't hear that.  You couldn't hear Dice?  No.  It's what I do.  It's all I do.  You know what I'm talking about when I do.  Look what he's doing now.  Look what he's doing. 
[01:23:30]  What do you think, are you stupid?  But the beginning of that sounds like walking.  Yeah?  Yeah, a little bit.  It really does.  Maybe he's trying to do some walking.  Let me play the first line.  It's what I do.  It's all I do.  It's what I do.  It's all I do.  Crazy.  A little walking, going to make an appearance there on More Sports at some point?  I was driving home in traffic the other day, and my cell phone rang, and it was walking.  It was the weirdest thing.  Get out of here.  I swear to God.  And what did he say to you?  That he couldn't do the show. 
[01:24:00]  Oh, wow.  No, but he said, you know, down the line, let's talk, you know.  And he brought up a movie that we were going to do together that I couldn't do.  And he's like, but it was just so weird to be in traffic.  The cell phone rings.  I pick it up, and he goes, Jay, it's Christopher Walken.  Like, that's what he said.  And for a split second, I thought, nah, this is somebody playing.  And then all of a sudden, I was awash with the fact that there's no faking royalty.  So he didn't think the masseuse idea was a good idea.  No, I didn't have him as the masseuse.  He was the manicurist. 
[01:24:30]  How would that sound again, Jay?  I'm not going to massage you.  Does that feel good when I massage you deep into your thighs like a man?  Red rocket.  Like a man.  Oh, look at you.  And what?  Now, a lot of people are asking, Jay, what's the open going to be on the next show?  What are some of the ideas in that creative head of yours? 
[01:25:00]  Nicole wrote one that we like, Guys My Wife Thinks Are Hot.  Guys Your Wife Thinks Are Hot.  And she actually would, like, point out why each guy in sports is hot in her opinion, and I would have to read it.  And you'd have to sit there being all emasculated.  Hey, that's not a bad idea.  But, like, Kyle Farnsworth, but it's photo-driven, like the baseball prediction.  So you'd see a picture of Kyle Farnsworth, and, like, literally his thighs are busting out of his pants.  And it's like, Look at the thighs, ladies.  Ooh, Kyle.  So, but it's a small thought now, but you know what? 
[01:25:30]  You poo-pooed the massage idea, and we hit a hole with that one.  We poo-pooed us being in the massage idea.  I always thought it was funny.  But now the good news is the whole world is open for what we can do together.  Yeah.  Hey, Jay, did you get wood during that opening?  No, we just went Barry.  Liar!  Oh, I miss you guys.  I've been on the West Coast way too long, baby.  Yeah, you've got to get back here, man.  Jay, so you didn't get a chubby? 
[01:26:00]  Come on, it's just us.  No.  Confess!  Liar!  Confess!  You stupid faggot!  Hey, hey, hey.  Yes, you wouldn't have as many audio things to play.  Hold on, let's try it again.  Let's see how good your fingers are.  Ready?  No.  Ask me again.  No, because you're going to say yes.  All right, hold on.  Right, and I want to see what you got for that one.  All right, hold on.  Because I love it.  Mule.  All right.  You've got to ask me first.  Hold on, I can go either way, but you've got to go yes or no, right? 
[01:26:30]  I'm going to say yes, so get all your yeses ready.  Jay?  Yes, sir.  When you were filming that massage opening last night, did you get, you know, a little pop tent?  Sadly, yes.  Hey, everybody!  We're all going to get laid!  Hey!  Oh, you had to bring gay Marco back.  Oh!  Hey!  Oh, God, you guys are the funniest.  I've got to get to the East Coast just so I can sit in my house and listen to you and then go over there. 
[01:27:00]  You've got to hang out, yeah.  We've got to get you guys out on the West Coast and burn it up.  Yeah, one of these days we'll actually broadcast from out there.  Oh.  I don't know what the hell the holdup is there.  Well, hey, you know what, then I can send it to everybody's schedule.  That's when we do the Opie and Anthony sketch.  All right, Jay, I'm going to try it one more time.  Yes, sir.  During that opening last night, when that guy was rubbing your tongue, did you get a chubby?  No!  What's the matter, Opie?  You couldn't find a sound? 
[01:27:30]  You were supposed to say yes there.  I did already!  I know, but I wanted...  I thought we were taking turns.  No, I wanted another...  I thought we were taking turns!  Hello, Cleese!  It's my turn now!  Opie, I've got to tell you something.  Uh-oh.  Last night when I was getting a massage in that sketch...  Yeah.  I...  I got wood.  Walk it off, dick.  Was that Brewer?  Yeah, it was Brewer.  You never hear enough Jim Brewer, America.  Brewer. 
[01:28:00]  Whoever's listening, buy that ticket.  And, Norton, you're going on tour, right?  Yes, sir.  I go to Boston tomorrow.  Thank you.  Fast thing.  Where are you going first?  Oh, I already did Philly, and I'm doing Boston tomorrow.  Yeah, we're all broadcasting live from BCN on Friday for Jim Norton's show.  I'm doing Boston Friday, yeah.  Yeah.  Well, Jim Norton makes me laugh, for what it's worth.  All right, Jay, we've got to let you go, because we've got to get to this Playmate of the Apes audio.  So...  You're being bumped for audio.  No, that's fine.  Audio of a porno movie.  Yeah.  Put me on with Stink, because I want to figure out on the internet how to listen to the show. 
[01:28:30]  Jay, he's Awesome Garrett now.  Yes.  See, you haven't been around in a while.  It's not Stinky anymore.  He's Awesome Garrett.  Is this, like, his rollerball name, or...?  Rollerball.  He's got a sweeper and everything.  He's got a song.  Listen.  Our Garrett is an awesome Garrett.  That's unbelievable.  What a jackass.  What a corncob.  Wait, you know all the players on our show. 
[01:29:00]  We've got one for everybody.  You know us?  Just about.  You know Steve from foundrymusic.com?  Steve, of course.  He plays a mean guitar.  Steve lost about 85 pounds.  He had his stomach stapled.  So this is what we have for Steve.  There you go.  I like the diversity of the musical approach.  You know Earl?  Black Earl, right?  Black Earl.  Does he still work there now?  I don't know.  I thought he was hiding in a broom closet.  We really don't know, which makes this perfect. 
[01:29:30]  Listen to this one.  Our Earl is a lazy Earl.  And when you say still work here, wouldn't you have to have worked at all until you can  still do something?  Yeah, I never really don't do anything, except walk around wearing black.  Right.  That's his job.  Jay?  Yes, sir.  We've got three new ones.  This one I think you were the inspiration for.  Oh.  Uh-oh.  Our producer, Rick.  Remember what you said?  Oh, no!  If it says, period, I'm going to dive out the window. 
[01:30:00]  You were the one who noticed something about Rick when you were both in the men's room  one day.  Don't remind me.  I buried that so deep.  But why don't we use peeler?  Peeler is even better.  Yeah.  We might have to redo this, but it's along the same lines.  It's a rough cut.  I understand.  Here we go.  Our Rick is an uncut Rick.  Fantastic.  Poor Rick.  And then, well, then there's Aunt and I. 
[01:30:30]  Ah.  Mine's very obvious.  Hold on.  Our O is a psycho O.  Never underestimate the psycho factor in my head.  Oh, thank you, Jim.  And finally, Anthony.  Ah, yes.  Our N is a horny N.  Really?  You're kidding.  You don't say.  I don't know how that went.  Guys, I cannot thank you enough for the support, man.  It was so much fun yesterday. 
[01:31:00]  And just being able to say, okay, terrific.  The first words out of my mouth.  Well, Jay, if the show sucked, it would be a lot harder to fake it and get on the air.  Well, you would fake it.  We'd be like this.  Oh, Christ.  Jay's calling, man.  All right.  Put him off.  Put him off.  Put him off.  Yeah.  Jay was good.  The lighting on the show was great.  Right.  You know, who does that lighting?  But, no, it's a funny show.  It's different than anything else, I think, that's on, especially on ESPN.  And best of luck, man. 
[01:31:30]  I love that Rock Kim was saying my name.  I looked at Walter, the guy that wrote the show with me, and I said, you realize guys are watching this in prison?  And Rock Kim is saying my name.  Wait a minute.  Who's that?  Yeah, right.  He must be on the Aftermath album with Dr. Dre.  All right, Jay.  We're going to let you go.  Gentlemen, I thank you.  And more gags to come.  But think about it.  Think about what you want to do, because whatever you want to do, we just get you out here and we do it.  I've got to tell you something, then, because it's now a running bit.  You've got to call us when you have the open for show number two. 
[01:32:00]  Okay.  Should I make it gayer?  I don't think you can.  Oh.  Do you underestimate me, Anthony?  Yeah, I know.  God bless you guys.  You suck.  Make it gayer than the answer to question number 10 on ESPN.com.  Oh, well, then?  Oh, gee.  You pretty much admitted you'd have sex with Bono.  No, I said if you had sex with Bono, your friends wouldn't call you gay.  They would just say, was he cool?  Yeah, that's kind of gay, too. 
[01:32:30]  We've got to be open-minded here on this show.  How many good answers can you have?  A nine out of ten ain't bad.  Hey, you know what?  Because this could be a fast one.  Why don't we...  Hey, Jay, why don't you help us out with this?  Did you get the May issue of Playboy?  Playboy?  No.  You know Kiana from...  Kiana's Sex Flex Appeal?  Remember that?  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Well, say hi to her.  Hi, baby.  Hey, uh...  Kiana.  Hi.  Kiana Tom.  There she is.  How are you guys? 
[01:33:00]  Very good.  We saw your spread there in Playboy.  Yes.  Very good.  Thank you.  Very nice.  Thank you very much.  How much did you get paid?  Kiana, you're on with Jay Moore.  Hi, Jay.  His new show is Moore Sports on ESPN.  Oh, cool.  Kiana, we all know how beautiful you are, but I have a funny feeling that your looks are probably  the least of your qualities.  Oh.  Oh.  Yeah, I'm going to leave it out on that note.  Peace. 
[01:33:30]  Jay's hanging up.  Jay's hanging up.  Yeah.  Well, Kiana, yeah, we used to watch you all the time doing the Flex Appeal.  And we don't work out.  Yeah.  You'd be surprised how many times I hear that.  There was no working out.  This was when we were up in Massachusetts, and I would call Opie, or Opie would call me,  and we'd sit on the phone in front of our respective televisions just commenting on how  hot you are and what you were doing.  Like, we'd be on the phone, and, you know, maybe there was a little silence going on. 
[01:34:00]  We'd just be watching.  And then you'd do something where you arch your back to lay down and do some lifting on  your back.  And we'd both just go, oh, look at what she's doing now.  Oh, my God.  Check this out.  Yeah.  Yeah, very, very nice.  As we worked on our muscles.  I don't know if I should say thank you or, you know, be kind of scared of you guys.  My uncle and I used to watch you together and, you know, just kind of get to know each  other.  What?  Really?  Two men just watching a little workout tape, helping each other out. 
[01:34:30]  Oh, why not?  Whatever turns you on, you know?  It's not gay if you don't make eye contact.  Oh, God.  Don't mind him.  That's Jim Norton.  Oh, that's funny.  He's very pretty.  He's on a new show on CBS called Touched by an Uncle.  Now, what made you do the Playboy thing?  Oh, it's something I've been thinking about for a long time, and I've always thought that  their photographs were just beautiful.  And the Playboy, you know, presented me with a terrific business opportunity, and I got 
[01:35:00]  to work closely with them and select the photographers and help select the final photos and the location  and everything.  And plus, I wanted to make sure my body was in the best shape possible before I did it.  Really?  Funny.  Yeah.  And in another way, the ratings started dropping.  Yeah, it must have been the money, right?  That's what Jim Norton is saying, but he's just whispering in the background because he's  a pussy.  I didn't want to interrupt.  She was talking, and I was just saying...  You think she did it for the money, Jim? 
[01:35:30]  Of course.  Well, I'm not knocking that.  It's fine.  Believe me.  There's nothing wrong with that.  Kiana, now, Ann and I are very picky when we look at naked women.  She's gorgeous.  I got it.  Norton took the money in gonorrhea magazine, and he had no qualms about it.  He tells everybody how much he made.  Yeah, but they didn't show my face.  It was just a back shot.  Were you arching your back?  I let them put lemon juice on them.  We all laughed.  TMI.  Too much information.  Yeah, exactly.  Oh, sorry.  That's Norton. 
[01:36:00]  Yay.  So we saw your spread there.  At first, Ann and I got a little scared because a little too muscular.  Rick likes the muscle girls.  But then, as we moved on through your pictorial, then we came back around, and then we think  you're just absolutely a knockout, man.  When did you have those lovely breasts put in?  Many moons ago.  It was?  A long time ago?  Many moons ago.  Like even when you were doing the workout thing years ago on ESPN or wherever it was?  Oh, before I started in television. 
[01:36:30]  Really?  Yeah.  What were you doing before?  Were you always an instructor, a fitness instructor?  In college, you know, I went to UCLA.  I taught aerobics and lifted weights, and actually I competed in a couple bodybuilding contests.  And I love the look of muscular women, but I don't think women should be too muscular.  I think it looks sexier to be fit and hard and feminine.  So I decided to go more the fitness route instead of the professional bodybuilding direction. 
[01:37:00]  Oh, Dice wants to say something?  I like the fat slobs.  You do?  I don't like the, uh, I don't like what you call the, uh, the hard bodies.  Well, then you shouldn't buy a Playboy.  You should probably buy, um, a different magazine.  What the hell?  Fat slob magazine.  Yeah, exactly.  Glenn is on line nine.  He says, uh, Flex Appeal is my favorite porno.  Oh, geez, man.  You must get some, uh, crazy letters, huh?  Very crazy letters, yeah.  Well, I don't work out much, but I feel like I'm unhealthy because my doctor says I swallow 
[01:37:30]  a lot of aggression.  Swallows a lot of pizzas.  Pizzas.  I didn't know John Candy was in the studio today.  Jesus.  Great.  Great.  You never danced or anything like that with that body?  You're talking to me?  Yeah.  Oh, no, I'm talking to Jim Norton.  Lighten up, Francis.  Do I, have I ever danced?  Yeah, you ever dance or anything like that?  Get yourself through college?  Oh, you mean like strip?  Yeah.  No.  No?  Why?  You got the body for it. 
[01:38:00]  That's why I was asking.  You ever Jell-O wrestle with ox?  No, no Jell-O wrestling.  With ox?  Let the MPs come and take everyone away.  We're on a way to Bingo Parlor, directions, get all...  Yes, that's the one.  Oh, that's funny.  All right, Kiana.  Well, we love, uh, we love the spread, definitely.  Did you, did you, did you check out the rest of the magazine?  I did, yeah.  Actually, we have a, um...  What do you think of the blonde?  Um, she's very pretty.  I don't know her.  It's funny how much, so many people think I know all the girls in there. 
[01:38:30]  You know, I, I, I don't know any of them.  She's really hot, though.  Guys in her car club used to call her the cruiser.  Okay.  Yeah, yeah.  All right, she's uncomfortably laughing now, Jim.  Don't worry about Jim Norton.  It's a little odd.  We don't know how to get that.  I'm just ignoring him.  Why am I being, I, why?  Any other, uh, magazines in your, uh, future?  Uh, anything where we might see a little more?  I just got back in from...  New curtains or something?  No? 
[01:39:00]  Um, just got back in from an interview with Extra.  It'll be on Friday.  Extra, yeah.  Cool.  That's good.  Yeah, and, uh...  But anything like Penthouse or Swank?  Anything like that?  No, I'm leaving that for you guys.  Yeah?  You ever see, uh, you ever see Hustler?  No, I haven't.  That's a good magazine.  Yeah, you like that one?  Yeah, they got what's called the Beaver Hunt.  You ever see that?  It's, uh, they get the regular girls from around the country.  And, uh, they put them in the magazine.  They submit their own photos.  And they, it's usually pretty graphic, you know? 
[01:39:30]  They're all Polaroids.  It looks like they were playing in Ted Bundy's glove compartment.  I miss that.  Oh, really?  It's something that sounds like I really love, though.  I think you're being a little sarcastic now, aren't you?  Me?  Sarcastic?  You like the classy aspect of Playboy.  I do, I do.  Because they don't show anything like, uh, what, Opie?  Uh, Kiana.  Yeah.  You're an Asian lady, right?  I'm Hawaiian, Chinese, and Irish.  Wow.  A little Irish in you, too, huh?  Ah, that's where the butt came from.  Yeah, exactly. 
[01:40:00]  She's hot from her head to her big toe.  Oh, she's gorgeous, but...  Her big toe...  And I have an observation about Asian ladies in general.  They got the short legs and the flat ass, but Kiana has a beautiful ass, so it had to  be the Irish.  Well, thank you.  That and the five sets of squats every day.  Yeah.  That's a fact, Jack.  That's it.  And who doesn't like squatting?  All right.  Well, Kiana, it's been wonderful chatting with you, and we're looking forward to maybe another  magazine appearance.  Who knows?  Yeah, you never know. 
[01:40:30]  And check out Extra on Friday.  All right.  And if anyone wants some autographed Playboy, just check out my website, Kiana.com.  Great.  What can we find on Kiana.com?  Anything fun?  Full army training!  Workout videos, exercise equipment, recipes.  I don't think you guys would like any of it.  No?  Recipes?  All right.  Listen, thanks a lot, you guys.  All right.  Thank you, Kiana.  Hey, is there a movie on this flight?  What's that?  A movie on this flight. 
[01:41:00]  Jim is a little schizo today.  I'm sorry, Kiana.  You guys are having way too much fun.  All right, Kiana.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  Oh, one more thing.  Oh.  What?  I love that.  Goddamn.  That's a record for Stripes references.  That was very good.  I couldn't think of any PJ Souls ones.  Ah, yeah.  Bill Murray was doing the ice cream scooper.  Spatula.  I kept trying to get Harold Ramis' awful voice out of my other spatula. 
[01:41:30]  Oh, all right.  Hey, look.  We're walking.  What was the special again?  I forget.  Remember, it was...  She's on the stove.  Yeah, no, I know, I know, I know.  What was the line, though?  No, I don't know.  I don't know.  It was awful.  We're going to have to watch that movie.  It was a part of the movie I didn't like, because John Candy was so great, and so was  the guy that played Francis in Warren Oates.  They told me the cruiser.  Guys in McCartney called me the cruiser.  I should have called him a dork.  It's the greatest when Larry Kedges tells him to shut up.  Shut up? 
[01:42:00]  Okay, sir.  Ah, Marcus.  Yeah.  Hey, what's up?  What's up, Marcus?  What's going on, man?  Yo.  I got a song for the Norton thing.  Okay.  For the Our Guys and Awesome Guys.  Yes.  How about Our Norton is a Norton?  Hmm.  They'll probably go with Jim, because it should be Our Jim, and then something.  I don't know what to use yet.  Well, anyway, can I get a real early, uh, what I learned? 
[01:42:30]  Dude, are you calling from, like, the 1950s?  Yeah.  I don't know about that.  Is that a Pink Floyd song in the background?  Stop the presses.  What the hell is it going on?  Extra, extra Jim Norton song.  Great Caesar's ghost, Kent.  I'm at work.  What was that?  Uh, cash register.  A what?  Cash register.  What place are you robbing?  What kind of cash register is that, though?  It's the worst.  You said the Olsen's mercantile. 
[01:43:00]  Look, he's running with the damn thing now.  You hear the wind.  Yeah, I just stepped out of a booth.  I worked in a little booth.  A booth?  Yeah, you know, a parking lot.  All right.  Oh, okay.  He works in a parking lot.  Oh, I think he meant a booth, like, into the mop job, believe me.  Thank you, Marcus.  All right.  All right.  Hey, Rick, why don't you call Playboy and see how that went?  Um, no.  Why?  We all had fun.  Nobody was mean to her.  We were just being silly beasts.  We were just being silly.  A little wacky.  Nobody was rotten or said she was a very pretty girl. 
[01:43:30]  A little zany.  All right.  Still to come on the show.  Thank God you didn't hear me saying meat curtains.  Yeah.  I know.  Look at that dumper, though.  I mean, come on.  I'd take a mouthful of solid expulsion.  Nice and clean.  All that goes through there is chopped vegetables and soy sauce.  Oh, so healthy.  Perfectly tapered, like a little forearm.  John, what's going on?  Guys, that was some of the best radio I've ever heard in my life. 
[01:44:00]  That was fun.  It was a nice little interview.  That dick is, oh, you guys tore it apart?  No.  You will never call back again.  Oh, we had a great little conversation with her.  It was all Stripes references.  There was nothing mean about it.  It wasn't like, you know, she's hot.  What are you going to say to her that's mean?  My favorite part of the call is right at the end.  Oh, wait, one more.  And then there was a delay.  And then she goes, yes, what?  You guys are the best.  Norton, you...  Oh, he was going to tell me I suck.  Okay.  Thank you, sir.  Lots to do, Ant. 
[01:44:30]  Yeah.  When we come back.  Audio from Playmate of the Apes.  Yeah.  Also, some girl wanted to do the 5 o'clock...  Oh, she hung up.  She might call back.  We're going to get an update from a Mount Everest guy.  Mount Everest guy.  This is a guy that's getting a huge wow sign made up that can take the brutal weather at  the summit of Mount Everest.  And he's climbing.  He's going to be...  Everest.  He's going to be the first one with asthma?  Asthma, I believe, is his claim to fame with this climb.  He'll be the first one.  And I guess he's getting a lot of publicity, and his main goal is to get a wow on top of 
[01:45:00]  Mount Everest.  On top of Mount Everest and get a picture of him on top of Mount Everest with a huge wow  flag waving proudly.  And we're going to be talking to him, you know, right until he dies.  Halfway up the mountain, we'll probably be talking to him off and on, because this is  something that takes months to do, Ant.  What's wrong with this guy?  The first guy to do jumping jacks with a cigarette in his mouth at 28,000 feet, you psycho.  Just stay home and be lucky you're alive. 
[01:45:30]  Old parrot lungs?  That's Chris Reeves.  Little intake, little outtake.  Little intake, little outtake.  Ah, look, he's doing it himself.  Parrot lungs.  That's a normal line.  I am sorry.  That's all right.  I stole yours in Philly and killed with it, so...  Yeah, you did.  You did owe me.  That was the line I was going to use.  I was going to go up on stage and do one lousy line, and I knew it would kill.  And you didn't go on those lines.  So I didn't go on stage, right?  Yeah.  Thanks for reminding me.  Yeah.  We're at the TLA, and Norton goes, hey, you know, Ope came down to check out the show, 
[01:46:00]  blah, blah, blah.  There he is.  You know, whatever.  Everybody cheers.  And then Norton proceeds to go, Ant isn't here because he's doing a threesome in Cleveland.  Yeah.  That was going to be my line.  He uses it.  Dude, kills.  Destroys.  Destroys.  Oh, God.  So now I'm standing up trying to out-scream.  How many people were there?  300, maybe?  I don't know.  No, about 500.  Oh, wow.  About 500.  I'm trying to out-scream 500 people going, wait, that's my line. 
[01:46:30]  And I see him in the corner, and I'm just taking credit like, yeah, folks, I've been writing.  That's what happens when you work hard, guys.  He refused to look my way because he knew that it was killing me.  I took a little glance and saw your blonde locks.  Did you give him a tussle when he got off stage?  I did.  I gave him a little tussle.  How about a fresca?  You know, I only got one line a day.  That was my line.  Yeah.  All right.  By the way, Bill Murray, stripes, spatula is called the Aunt Jemima treatment.  Yes. 
[01:47:00]  Yes.  That's what it was.  Okay.  Sam McPherson from BC.  Mount Everest guy, 5 o'clock, audio from Playmate of the Apes.  I've got to talk about the Osbournes, Ozzy calling in.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, and the black man game?  Jeez.  Yeah.  I just heard very little about this.  Rick told me, and I don't know what it is.  Oh, and the top five mistakes guys do in bed, and women are going to guess that.  Uh-huh.  And right around 2.30, you and I were looking at each other in the office going, holy ass, 
[01:47:30]  we have nothing for today's show.  And we want to talk about the Titanic ride.  And the Titanic ride.  I don't know what happened.  All of a sudden, there's a whole plethora of material.  I come in, and I don't say anything, and the magic just happens.  The magic just happens, indeed.  And you didn't want to come in today.  I didn't want to come in all day.  No, but it's just because you were...  Dude, the Keanu thing with the stripes, that's going to be classic stuff.  No, but it's just funny, though.  I was just kidding.  All right.  You both just look at me and go, if we don't do something quick, he'll start talking.  We should...  Jesus. 
[01:48:00]  We should bump something.  You want to bump something?  Yeah.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Brian from Philly.  Five things men do wrong during sex.  One, turning on the lights.  Two.  Use your real name.  Three.  Not leaving before she wakes up in the morning.  And four.  Caring if they get off.  And then five.  Helping clean their blank off.  I don't think those are the real ones.  You know, if we got to bump something, you know what we should bump?  The discussion about what we're going to bump.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:48:30]  Okay.  So if we take a break...  Exactly.  Because I know that's what everyone's saying.  Okay.  You're right.  You're right.  You're right.  You're right.  You're right.  So if we go real long, we got to make up for lost time. 
[01:49:00]  That's what that's about.  We're back with the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Yeah.  Wow.  Wow.  A lot of speculating going on.  Two cities will be dropping the O.N.A. show in the very near future.  And also in the very near future, a brand new city. 
[01:49:30]  We'll be welcoming the O.N.A. show.  Ah, welcome aboard.  To their sit-tay.  Lose two, gain one.  Yeah.  That's the break.  I guess something's going on in Vegas as far as this whole thing goes.  Bill, what's up?  Hey, our program director got on and he left a little message asking no one to call the F'n Station anymore because you guys are there to stay.  So I wanted to send a big-ass you to all the other 17 cities that might be losing you guys because we're not. 
[01:50:00]  He actually came on and said, don't call anymore.  O.N.A. aren't being canceled.  That's correct.  Maybe he's just throwing you off.  No, I don't think he wants the station burned down.  All right, cool.  Thanks, Bill.  Thanks, guys.  Getting a lot of calls from Vegas.  He must have just did this.  Can we get some audio of this?  Mark, what's going on? 
[01:50:30]  Hey, what's going on, everybody?  Hey.  Yeah, I'm from Vegas, too.  Yeah, that's what he said.  He was crying because everybody's calling him too much.  He's a whiner.  Whiner.  How far do you live from the Strip, Hotsie?  How far do I live from the Strip?  Yeah, a couple miles.  Yeah, no, no, no, no.  Yeah, are you near the things or the casinos?  Oh, right now I'm not near them.  I'm doing my deliveries.  I deliver out here.  How big are you down there?  You sick bastard.  Yeah, I'm going to deliver you, too, Gordon. 
[01:51:00]  No, do you live near the casinos, I'm saying?  Yeah, I do.  I live near the casino.  Cool.  All right.  All right.  Thank you, Mark.  All right.  You have a great one, guys.  You guys will rock.  Hey, Gordon.  Not going to work, sweetie.  Not going to work.  Doesn't everybody?  I'm too good.  Doesn't everybody in Vegas live near the action?  You know what?  There are places in Vegas where you can go and see the casinos.  You're still in Vegas, though.  You're minutes away from the casinos.  Not in Vegas, traffic.  Don't you hate people that have their little local things with their own towns? 
[01:51:30]  Like every bag of jizz thinks that Welcome to the Jungle was written about their city.  You bunch of creeps we all think alike.  All right.  And finally.  No means yes.  Finally carried for Vegas.  We now know that Vegas isn't dumping the show.  The local station is running a promo.  We've got to get this, Ben.  Featuring the PD, stating that O&A is the greatest thing ever and that they aren't dumping the show,  so stop effing calling me.  Wow.  They're getting pissed.  Isn't that something?  Oh, dude. 
[01:52:00]  Ben, what's up?  Hey, I know where you're joining next week.  Where?  Wichita, Kansas.  Wichita.  Wichita, Kansas.  F.  Wichita.  Oh, I think so.  No, we aim a little higher than that, my friend.  Wichita, Kansas.  We will not be on in Wichita.  I wouldn't even want to be on there.  Why the hell would you even come up with that city?  Being number one in Wichita is the same as being 35th in Yemen.  Who cares?  Exactly.  No Wichita for the O&A show. 
[01:52:30]  No.  No Wichita.  Go for what they call major markets.  Great city if you like corn or incest.  Or incest with corn, which is great.  Yeah, well, listen.  The cob, the sisters there.  Butter butters itself.  You pull it out.  Whoa.  A little toothy down there, are you?  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Hey, what are you, hey, you two quit shucking in there.  Hey, sweater vest, I said shucking.  We're heading into the silly zone again. 
[01:53:00]  I'm in a silly mood.  Okay, let's, uh, Goofy.  Let's play the audio from, uh, Silly Geese.  Playmate of the Apes.  Do you want to set this up, man?  Because I think we might have a new audience.  Ah, could be.  I think people got out of work at five and they're just tuning in the show right now.  Well, we got, uh, commercials running.  Ooh.  Uh, I, I believe they're locally.  I think that one is locally.  Yeah.  Oh, we played it for everybody.  We did play it for everybody.  For, uh, Playmate of the Apes.  And people weren't sure it was a real commercial.  They were saying it was the funniest damn thing they ever heard.  Hold on it.  Yeah. 
[01:53:30]  Got to backtrack.  Jim from Vegas.  Jim?  Yeah.  You got the audio?  Yeah.  It's on my cell phone, so I don't know how good quality it is.  Hold on a second.  Okay, baby.  Uh-oh.  They make a lot of program directors all the time.  And most of the time, they're right.  Even I know that the Opie and Anthony show is one of the best shows on radio.  Opie and Anthony are here to stay.  I can certainly assure you that they do not want to call it.  Great morning show, Johnson and Tommy.  It's hard to hear, Jim.  I'll play it one more time a little louder.  No, no.  I heard it.  Yeah, I got it.  Yeah, we kind of got it. 
[01:54:00]  All right.  Thank you.  You bet.  Bye, baby.  Later.  All right.  Now, audio of Playmate of the Apes.  Yeah.  And it's a video, a softcore porno.  That's about...  How's the sex, though?  It's...  The girls look hot.  I went to the website.  They look really hot.  The girls look hot.  The sex, the girl on girl is very good.  There you go.  Can you see...  Do they show...  Rick, because you saw this...  Do they show it graphically, or is it like they show certain body parts the way Playboy would show them? 
[01:54:30]  They go more...  Soft porn?  More penthouse type.  Soft porn.  And then...  But the dialogue in the commercial was so funny.  The acting, the stupid costumes are terrible.  There's one guy...  There's an ape with an English accent.  Ah, well, there you go.  So we figured from the commercial, from the humor in the dialogue of the commercial,  that the whole video had to just be packed with funny lines.  And we were right.  So Rick pulled a bunch of lines off of it. 
[01:55:00]  Yeah, let's play the first one here, Ant.  Audio from...  What the hell is going on?  John.  John.  John, John.  I'm going to turn around.  I think I'm going to turn around and see John, right?  Yeah.  It's John running the...  Running the sound.  Take it away.  John, I didn't do this.  Until we say, you know...  I didn't do this.  ...ready to go.  Look at him.  He's all happy from his being.  Audio.  Softcore porno movie.  Playmate of the apes.  They're all...  The premise is Planet of the Apes, but instead of Charlton Heston landing on the planet and 
[01:55:30]  a bunch of apes, it's some chick and a bunch of lesbians.  That's right.  In Apes costumes.  John, let's go to the tape.  What the hell is going on?  What happened?  The capsule opened early.  Oh, sure, Lieutenant Fornication.  That's why you guys were ass naked and kissing.  It just appeared that way.  Oh, right.  A likely story.  I wanted to make sure no one on the ship was contaminated.  That's why we were nude.  I was checking Lieutenant Pushkin to Cushkin's mouth for any germs.  Uh-huh.  And where the hell were you? 
[01:56:00]  What were you doing, Pushkin to Cushkin?  I don't know.  I don't even know what I'm doing here.  Wow.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't even know what I'm doing here.  What is she, Down Syndrome?  That'd make the movie even better.  Retards.  I don't know.  Oh, my God.  How great is that?  This should come in a box set with Voss doing Shakespeare. 
[01:56:30]  Why wasn't this up for an Academy Award?  And a guy with Down Syndrome to play one of the orangutans.  Very similar features.  And a low budget.  Yeah, you wouldn't have to spend much on the makeup.  Except the monkeys are a little smarter in real life.  Oh, God.  All right, let's go to more audio, Anthony, of Playmate of the Apes.  All right.  John, if you will.  Oh, stop me hurting me.  Where is this place? 
[01:57:00]  How did these monkeys get like this?  Stop it.  Stop it.  Stop it.  Stop it.  Actually, that feels pretty good.  Rick, now, was the monkey banging her? 
[01:57:30]  No.  Actually, no.  This was a capture scene when they caught them after the spaceship exploded and crashed.  I thought we were playing the Oz game again.  How are the special effects?  I was going to guess Becker.  Cartoon-like.  These special effects aren't so special.  Dude, it was like a really bad, like, TV.  It was like Plan 9 of Out of Space.  Oh, really?  Kind of?  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Stupid mind.  Do we have more audio?  Oh, yeah.  We got a bunch of clips. 
[01:58:00]  All right.  Let's do some more audio from Playmates.  All right.  Of the Apes.  Apes.  Excuse me.  Go ahead, John.  Dr. Cuira, how can you read this stuff when I'm trying to tell you something?  Dr. Conholius, don't get your panties in a bun.  Oh, dear.  So, Martinda, perhaps I could have a steaming bowl of feces to go with my human brain, please.  Ah!  What?  Ah!  Can I say... 
[01:58:30]  Cornholius.  Can I please say for the record, a bit of advice to anybody that's trying to make anything  sexy, humor and sex never cross over well.  No guy, you have no understanding, no guy waxes his bag and goes, ha, ha, ha, ha, we don't  want to laugh.  Like, you want to see great porn, get the old Curdy Stevens classics, taboo, taboo, too.  There was no jokes.  Some people enjoy this.  No, they don't.  Yes, they do.  They absolutely do when they're a sponsor on this program. 
[01:59:00]  Dude, don't worry, we don't care.  They enjoy the hell out of this type of...  Dude, I'm not saying that the sex isn't good.  Just stop with the bad dialogue and the little funny names.  Cornholio.  I'm sorry.  And Queera.  Instead of Zera, it was Queera and Cornelius was Cornholio.  All right, let's listen to more of the audio.  All right, playmate of the apes.  So, hearing off again about the daggo humans again, are we? 
[01:59:30]  The only good effing human is a dead human.  Spreading AIDS virus around our city, eating our food.  The only thing they're good for, scientific experimentation.  Brasting them off into space.  Yes, I say, give them all the Spanish archer.  But, General, I was just discussing with my colleague here...  The fofter?  Yes.  The whole Coco Darwin theory of evolution.  How we have all come and actually evolved from humans. 
[02:00:00]  Do you notice that they said effing?  Did they?  Yeah, he said effing.  Which is nice.  A minute before you show two people squat thrusting over each other's faces.  Take out that dirty talk.  Oh, schmucks.  I didn't enjoy that audio as much as the others.  I like the others where they're all very worked up or sex or sounding like morons.  It was really funny with that clip is that you hear the guy talking, but his voice is all muffled from the stupid costume. 
[02:00:30]  Well, yeah, it's kind of a visual though, Rick.  That would have been a good visual.  A little visual, Rick.  It doesn't work as well in radio.  You know, like a facade.  Yeah.  It's a visual thing.  False front.  How many more we got?  Three more.  Three more.  Hopefully this one's a little better.  All right.  Audio from Playmate of the Apes.  You can burn snow.  Oh, s**t.  And you can talk, too. 
[02:01:00]  You must be one of those humans from the tropics.  Polly, want a cracker?  No, I don't want a cracker.  I want to get out of this madhouse.  This is a madhouse.  Whorehouse.  Whorehouse.  Wow.  Horrible dialogue.  What is the direct correlation between a grandfather burying two fingers and never learning how to act? 
[02:01:30]  Why does Total say, why does one of the apes sound like Mr. Deltoid from A Clockwork Conference?  Wow.  Hi, yes.  She gave me the key.  A bit of nastiness.  Who wants to save you from yourself?  Very good.  I think we got two more to go.  Yeah.  Audio from Playmate of the Apes.  Like the madhouse.  Are there more of you? 
[02:02:00]  No, no, no.  You listen to me, all right?  I'm from planet Earth, right?  I'm with the United States Air Force.  Sure you are.  Okay?  You got my crew, two other astronauts, locked up in your clink.  So, if you don't mind, stay right where you are.  Stay right here.  Don't move.  I have to make a phone call.  Dr. Cuira, Dr. Cuira, get General Aiden, Sergeant Jericho on the phone right away and 
[02:02:30]  tell them and the whole gang to meet me down at Andrews.  Oh, Dr. Cuira, bring your tap shoes.  We're going dancing.  Oh, my God.  Astronaut was a big word for her.  Me, my crew.  She couldn't fly a kite, and they're trying to make it sound like she can fly a spaceship.  I'm supposed to buy that?  The premise that she is an astronaut? 
[02:03:00]  An astronaut.  Yes.  They say that like that every time, I bet.  I bet you they even wrote in parentheses, A-S-S, parentheses, wink, astronaut.  I'm an astronaut.  Yes, you are, aren't you?  Is this the best clip of all?  Yep.  You always finish on an up note.  Here we go.  Oh, that is good stuff.  You like that?  I love that.  Will you do my thighs?  Jay, what are you doing?  I have to get ready for the show.  Well, I'm a little nervous and tense, you know, so I thought I'd get a massage from the ESPN 
[02:03:30]  studio masseuse.  Jay, we don't have a studio masseuse.  Wow.  There you go.  That's the gay scene, right?  Yeah.  And one more, or no?  Ah.  One more clip from Playmate of the Apes.  Yes.  Fornication, come on.  Tell him.  Tell him.  You pushers. 
[02:04:00]  You bastard.  You've got her brain out.  I'll kill you.  I'll kill every one of you.  Get your filthy paws on me.  I'm with a bag of stunners, and I hope I never see them dangle faces again.  Get your filthy paws on me.  I'll kill you.  But she didn't have a brain to begin with.  Maybe they were giving her one. 
[02:04:30]  You're a gun at me.  Oh, my God.  Was that music from The Shining, or was that wrong?  That little music in the background right there.  Oh, maybe.  Didn't it sound like The Shining?  It did.  It did.  When Danny's riding his little thing around.  And then he bumps into two girls or something.  Hey, Grady.  Cook.  All right.  We've got to take a break.  You married man, are you, Mr. Grady? 
[02:05:00]  Where's that Jim Norton thing?  I want to play that.  Your son is in contact.  The one where he makes fun of himself.  I'm attempting to bring an outside party into this situation.  A nigger.  A nigger.  A nigger.  Cook.  He's so concerned.  He's so concerned.  What a great goddamn movie that was.  It was a ghost who murdered his family.  Really?  All right. 
[02:05:30]  Well, that's fantastic.  I'm sure everyone's just going to run out and get plenty of audio.  Do you want to hear more audio?  We got more?  We can find more.  I think we need to find the audio of the, you know,  at the grand finale.  Or the, well.  Statue of Liberty scene, maybe.  I'm sure they have a similar scene.  Yeah, we need audio of, like, the scenes that parody the.  Right.  Like, that was great with the, you cut out her brain  and take your stinking paws off me, 
[02:06:00]  but she didn't say you're damn dirty apes.  Ah, Anthony.  Yo, what's up, guys?  How you doing?  All right.  Do you have the clip where she says,  you have a mule?  Yeah, doesn't that sound like her?  Sounds just like her.  It did.  It did sound a lot like Steve-O's girlfriend.  Yeah.  I got one more for her piece.  No, that's not going to work.  Hang on.  Ah, later.  All right.  Silly goose.  Someone got me.  I got one more.  He's all nervous.  I got one more.  Oh, please don't.  Hey, mule.  You're not on to me. 
[02:06:30]  It's not on to me.  I'm going to hang up.  Oh, he got me.  Oh, Jesus, damn.  Wow, this is right on.  Oh, wow.  Holy cow.  Eric, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  She's an astronaut like Denise Richards in 007 was a professor.  You remember that scene?  Yeah, yeah.  Some of those people they cast like a professor.  Or Denise Williams in that movie where they were killing the bugs there.  Denise Richards, Starship Trooper.  She had some dialogue in that 007.  I piloted a big battle cruiser thingy. 
[02:07:00]  Norton, you're here.  And I'm the best.  You're here, Norton.  Thanks, fella.  You got it.  God bless.  All right.  Let's take a break.  All right.  Top five mistakes guys make in bed, I guess.  We'll have the ladies try to guess that next.  Guy in the monkey suit sounds like Ted Kennedy.  Oh, you got to listen to this before we take an actual break.  All right.  Feeling low?  The best way to not feel like a worthless douchebag is to listen to an even bigger piece of crap.  I am awful. 
[02:07:30]  With the Jim Norton motivational tapes, you'll feel better about yourself instantly.  I stink.  Paint your body?  Take it from Jim.  I'm a meaty-breasted little nothing.  It could be a lot worse.  This sucks.  Problems at work?  I epped up an ABC audition today.  Hey, at least you have a job.  Everything I do, I look like the Manchurian can today.  You'll be amazed at how much confidence you have after you listen to a mushy little nothing tool on himself for hours on end.  Shut up, kidless.  I'm a nut.  Almost 13 years I'm doing comedy.  God, there is no justice in this world.  It sucks.  You have the warmth of a trout. 
[02:08:00]  What a retard I am.  Does anybody not see the disgrace in this?  Everyone loves Jim's inspirational live appearances.  It's a night of pale, meaty-breasted dullness.  Coming to a town near you.  I'm Margaritaville.  I don't sing ever, you idiots.  Stay tuned for details.  Just f***ing listen to the station and get tickets, you douchebags.  Love yourself.  Hate him.  I suck.  With the Jim Norton motivational tapes.  That's me, Jim Norton, folks.  Ugh.  All the news you need to know and moves. 
[02:08:30]  This is W.O.W., the WOW radio station.  And we're back with the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Seven Dust Praise.  Speaking of which, Anthony.  Yeah.  Our buddy, our pal on the hotline here.  I can get him on here.  Le'jean.  What's up?  Please figure up Seven Dust, baby.  How are you doing?  I am actually fantastic, man.  Very good.  Yeah, we just finished with Soundtech the first night of this, I guess, is going to be an incredible tour, man. 
[02:09:00]  We have taken out the guys in Reveille, Soil, and Breaking Point.  And Cuddy Whiskey is sponsoring it.  And it's great, man.  Hey, thanks for the Cuddy Whiskey, by the way.  Oh, my God, man.  You know what?  Actually, to be honest with you, don't say anything.  It's just live on air.  Well, yeah.  I'm on the radio right now.  Listen, I think everybody's coming to see the damn Cuddy girls.  Let me check this out.  I saw, like, four of them walk in. 
[02:09:30]  And four of them look so hard to go up there, I believe.  What?  Security!  What's going on around here?  Dude, you sent us so much Cuddy.  We don't know what to do with it.  You rock for that, man.  I'm sorry, man.  So what's going on?  Well, we had a great time with you and the band, what, that was a week ago already?  Yeah.  Yeah, we already miss you guys.  Cool.  No one does it like you boys, man.  We try, man.  You got to check in during the tour and let us in on some of the stories and stuff so we 
[02:10:00]  can live through you, LeJean.  Well, you know, I live vicariously through others, so I'll just let you know what I see.  Yeah, we have to, because, you know, a touring rock band like that, there's going to be stories.  We want to hear them.  Yeah.  You're the trip.  I know who it is.  You guys are starting the tour tonight on Long Island, right?  Yeah.  We're at the Vanderbilt, and the club is actually really nice.  Oh, yeah.  We've been down there a lot.  We've done a couple road shows there, Vanderbilt and Plainview.  Yeah, we've never been here, and it's a nice club.  I might have to dress up and look nice tonight, damn it. 
[02:10:30]  You should go for biker fight night.  That's a big crowd, turns out.  That's how I do it.  Yeah, have you seen any bloodstains?  What's that?  Have you seen any bloodstains?  No, you know, I heard about that stuff, man.  We're keeping that on the down low.  We're trying to come out here and have some fun.  You know, we got the cutty girls.  Well, that's the way the bikers have their fun.  LeJean, it was one of the sickest scenes in Long Island history.  Only about, what, like two or three weeks ago, right in that club.  Were you here for this, for that thing?  Hell no.  What, are you crazy?  I wouldn't be there. 
[02:11:00]  We want to survive 30 seconds in that atmosphere.  I heard that.  I like to ride bikes and stuff, but, you know, I just like to ride bikes.  Yeah, you don't want to get involved in the lifestyle.  I mean, no disrespect.  I love everything, you know, but I just want to ride my bike.  Yeah, just to let everyone else in, it was two biker gangs just going, I mean, hardcore.  Yeah.  At the Vanderbilt in Plainview a few weeks back.  Gunfire, knives.  They collected all the weapons, and they had two or three boxes filled.  Filled with weapons.  With guns and knives and brass knuckles. 
[02:11:30]  But that won't be happening during the 7-Dust show.  No, of course not.  No.  Just smoke a joint and have a beer.  Chill out.  Right.  Relax.  Have a good time.  Yeah.  That's what I say.  Yeah, these biker gangs, they got to put down, you know, the meth and then pick up the weed.  Ah, yeah.  No one would fight if they were on the weed.  But down the crystal meth.  Are you guys smoking weed on the radio?  Yeah.  Oh, what?  What happened?  I was just smoking one anyway.  I just thought I would talk to y'all about it.  You know, I'd be a silly. 
[02:12:00]  You know, I saw you guys perform in L.A. in the Viper Room.  I was with my buddy.  Oh, my goodness.  You walked off stage, and I was like, you guys are good, and you're like, thanks.  That was it, huh?  It's true.  They were unheard of at the time.  Unheard of, man.  Or they were just starting to become heard of.  If they played in the Viper Room, they were heard of.  You know why?  We probably just rode there all the way from Atlanta in the back of a van like we were doing  back in that day.  No, no, John, I'll tell you what happened.  You saw Jim Norton, and quite frankly, you were scared for your life and decided, I'd better  just say hi and keep walking. 
[02:12:30]  Norton, was your conversation cut short by a convulsing River Phoenix out in front of  the place?  I don't know, but you know what, man?  That's funny you said, the Viper Room.  I remember that date like it was yesterday, because it meant so much to us to be a beginning  band and to be at a place like that, you know?  Yeah, that's legendary, man.  Sure, exactly.  All right.  Hey, we're still here.  Hey, Lashon, we've got to let you go.  We've got so much going on.  We're going to dig into the cutty, and you've got to give us a call from time to time when  you're on the road. 
[02:13:00]  I would love to, man, and thank you guys very much, and we will talk to y'all soon.  And rave reviews on the two songs you did for us, by the way.  Oh, cool.  Why don't we love working with you guys, and please have us back again, and I'll let the  curls and Cuddy and all the guys in the band know that you guys are behind the tour, my  friends.  All right.  Cool, man.  And thanks for the case of Cuddy.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  Yeah, they already hooked y'all up.  Oh, my God, they hooked us up.  All right, bro.  Maybe they'll hook us up with some drinks.  Cool.  All right.  Lashon, thank you so much.  We'll talk to you soon, all right?  Later, bro. 
[02:13:30]  Goodbye, sir.  Thanks, man.  All right.  There he goes, Lashon, lead singer of Seven Dust, playing tonight at the Vanderbilt in  Plainview, Long Island.  And we got a few prize packages from Cuddy's, Sark, to give away.  And the tickets?  Ah, Cuddy.  A couple of our listeners will get some cool stuff.  Ah, Cuddy.  And tickets for tonight's show with Seven Dust.  How about the 102.7th caller?  Ho, ho.  Can I ask you a question?  This is true. 
[02:14:00]  Because I'm not in-depth in radio.  I just hang here.  When they say, oh, the 94th caller, is it really always the 94th caller or is it garbage?  No.  No, you go to, like, the lie.  It's a lie.  Just to imply that that many people called in.  And, yeah, it's got to kind of tie into the station's frequency number.  Awful.  Yeah.  No, DJs are lazy.  They just, you know, hit the third and say, okay, you're the 94th caller.  Opie.  Yeah, Opie.  M from Philly sent me a great site.  It's a complete guide to having sex with a dolphin. 
[02:14:30]  He's got it all spelt out.  This doesn't look like some wacky site.  This looks like someone.  Is this the official website to go to if you're thinking about having sex with a dolphin?  It's got to be the official site.  All the info you need to have sex with a dolphin.  Turn that around.  And this guy sounds like he has done it before.  Look.  Let me just see the front page.  Picture of a cute dolphin on the front.  It's danmarino.com.  Pew.  Pew. 
[02:15:00]  He says he's got introductions.  He removed his name because, you know, it says to protect dolphin lovers.  This is really legit.  He said to themselves dolphin lovers.  Yeah.  I hear the dolphins are pretty horny.  He says dolphins are very intelligent, highly emotional, and expressive creatures.  I have a friend.  Shut up, Dick.  They enjoy the company of humans.  And if a relationship develops between a human and a dolphin, it has happened to me, he says, 
[02:15:30]  they will on occasion wish to express their trust and affection for you in the most direct way through mating or sex play.  Dolphins do not use sex purely for procreation reasons, just like humans.  There is a certain bond.  And he says, people continue to ask, how do you mate with a dolphin?  Easy.  Let the dolphin tell you.  And he's got ways to have sex with a dolphin. 
[02:16:00]  All right.  Well, first he goes through identifying the difference between male and female dolphins.  He goes, that seems important.  Are you a...  Well, of course you are.  Why am I just asking?  Because that would be silly.  Are you a homo if you have sex with a male dolphin?  I don't know.  I would assume.  But he goes, tells the male dolphin has two separate slits underneath for their unit.  And then he describes where the balloon knot of the dolphin is, separated by a bridge of skin. 
[02:16:30]  I guess dolphins have chains, too.  The male opening further up toward the navy explains.  And the female describes where the fins are and where the various openings of a female dolphin are.  And how do you know if a dolphin wants to have sex?  He tells you.  Males are the easiest to detect.  They'll swim around sporting wood.  No way.  Anywhere between their pack and anywhere between 10 and 14. 
[02:17:00]  Oh, my God.  Black dolphins.  They...  And it says they have no problem swimming up to you and placing their junk within reach of your hand.  And they say the best thing you could do with a male dolphin, to have sex with it, if you're a man or a woman,  or if you're just a man and you want to have sex with a male dolphin,  the best thing they say to do, Opie, is to just use your hands. 
[02:17:30]  Help the dolphin out.  Right.  Help them out.  And that's fine.  They do say that women can actually have sex with a dolphin.  Wait, women?  Yes.  If they think they can accept something of that size.  But if you get caught, you're supposed to go, hey, I wasn't doing it on purpose.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha. 
[02:18:00]  So, um...  They say some women can accept that, but there is a warning here.  In the considerations of safety, you should never allow a male dolphin to attempt balloon knot action.  And they, of course, have the technical term, which we can't use here.  It's coming right for us! 
[02:18:30]  A bottlenose dolphin, their junk is around averaging 12.  They're packing 12.  Very muscular.  That's all?  And the thrusting and the force of when they finish can cause serious internal injuries resulting in peritonitis and possible death.  So they don't recommend that.  You get F to death.  Yeah, by a dolphin.  Well, just tell the dolphin.  You never want to get F to death, right?  You have to communicate it first. 
[02:19:00]  They say...  Hey, Jim, you idiot.  It doesn't take long for a male to finish, around 40 seconds to a minute.  It's usually accompanied by either a shuddering, just prior, and a thrusting and tail arching during finishing.  The force can be powerful, so it's best to keep your face out of the line of fire.  Or keep the junk, as they would say, underwater. 
[02:19:30]  Is that supposed to be sexy?  It says you can attempt to use your mouth.  Get the F out!  I was buying it up until then.  It's describing every single means to have this type of relationship with a dolphin.  It says, but be warned, do not try to accept a lot and make sure you don't have it in that position when he finishes.  Anthony, don't explain this to selfish. 
[02:20:00]  How about those of us that are team players?  Let's see the rest of this.  All right, now for the female.  Female dolphins, once they show interest in you, can be supported in much the same way as the male.  One hand under the fin, supporting her.  The other doing the stimulation.  The dolphin reach around.  Who knew that was possible?  The man in the boat of the female is located at the top of the point where their business is done. 
[02:20:30]  Huh?  I'm just trying to say that.  It's the prominent lump.  You can feel it.  Rub this with your finger, tips, or lick and suck.  But with the mouth, you might end up with a bruised nose as they thrust up toward you.  Yes.  Wait, what?  Yes.  Is it in bad taste to go, hey, it smells fishy?  You can actually slide your hand. 
[02:21:00]  Ovi, they say you can slide your hand.  Let's just say till it disappears.  Feel around, it says.  Hand?  Rubbing gently.  Like a fat chick.  They feel warm and muscular inside.  They're all pink on the inside.  They say certain parts that names are similar to female anatomy of a human.  Certain of those parts, which we call curtains or what have you, are tough, squishy sponge. 
[02:21:30]  When they are excited, don't be surprised if they start to play with your hand.  They have very manipulative muscles and can use them to carry and manipulate objects, including your hand.  They can do things that would make a regular woman turn green with envy.  When they finish, it's coupled with a stiffening, shuddering, sometimes a lot of thrusting, clenching, and muscular contractions, and sometimes vocalization.  Mating. 
[02:22:00]  Mating.  This is harder.  Obviously, being human, it's awkward, but not impossible to mate in open water.  It is easier to have the dolphin in a shallow area, like shallows off a beach, one and a half to two feet of water.  Imagine the beachgoers looking on as you're just raping a dolphin in one and a half feet of water.  Then I'll point at you, who is that bad mother effer? 
[02:22:30]  This is usually comfortable enough for both the dolphin and you.  Gently, you should roll the dolphin on her side so she's laying belly toward you.  You can prop yourself up on an elbow, lie belly to belly.  You may want to use the other arm to gently hold her close.  Hey!  Like you got your arm around her.  Now, take the junk and kind of put it near that promised land of the dolphin. 
[02:23:00]  Red rocket, red rocket.  And she will, if interested, arch her body in a way.  Get the F out.  Where you're all of a sudden doing it.  That's A. Seems legit.  Is there AP next to any of this stuff?  No.  So it can't be true?  There's usually a fair bit of wriggling and shifting, usually to get comfortable, both outside and whatever.  Once comfortable, though, females initiate a series of muscular contractions that rub the entire length of said junk. 
[02:23:30]  They may also thrust rhythmically against you.  So enjoy the experience while you can, since you will rarely last longer than a minute or two.  Just prior to her finishing, she will speed up the contractions and thrusts.  It's interesting to note that the times I have mated with female dolphins, they have timed their finishing with mine.  Whether it's consciously or not, I don't know. 
[02:24:00]  But the feeling to have both of your bodies shuddering against each other at one time is fantastic.  When did you do this?  Just the last time I was on vacation down in the Bahamas.  I'm reading verbatim, Opie.  And you're missing the one big thing, the giant advantage to all this, is you don't have to boot the dolphin out of your hotel room.  No, it says one thing to note.  Let me finish.  Whether you use your hands or an actual bringing together of you and dolphin happen, whether it's male or female, the guy says always spend time with them afterwards. 
[02:24:30]  Cuddle, rub, talk to them.  Most importantly, show them you love them.  This is essential, and it helps strengthen the bond between you, like a way of saying that this just wasn't some one-night fling.  The dolphin appreciates it, and they will want your company more the next time you visit.  And then they go into things like, what diseases can you get?  And he says he's never heard of any diseases that you can get from a dolphin.  And then there's more about the hand, and where can I find dolphins to have sex with? 
[02:25:00]  Aquariums are a bad choice, he says, for many reasons.  Too public.  He says, yeah, you pretty much got to go down to a place like the Caribbean, Turks and Caicos, places like that, and find a friendly dolphin.  He says, this is very special.  Well, don't abuse this privilege between a human and dolphin.  There it is. 
[02:25:30]  They call him Flipper, Flipper, faster than lightning.  I suck it!  The one you see is smarter than he.  A virgin.  Can I touch it? 
[02:26:00]  Everyone loves the king of the sea.  I'm sticking in my mouth.  Oh, jeez, I don't want to get the eggs, fellas.  Those men wanted to have sex with me.  Hey, everybody, we're all going to get laid.  Puss-a, puss-a, puss-a!  Are you calling Flipper?  Excuse me while I whip this out.  No one you see is out. 
[02:26:30]  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  And we know Flipper lives in all around the world.  Your paws are chilly.  Flying there under, under the sea.  Yeah, thank you, Dick.  Sweet, merciful crab!  How about a nice bucket of eggs?  I would say any kind of relations like that with an animal, bad idea.  Personally, I would say bad idea. 
[02:27:00]  Never good.  Sex with the dolphin.  Let's go to...  They are cute, aren't they, though?  Yeah.  Let's go to Rod.  Give the nose a tussle.  Grab that bottle nose.  Rod.  Rod.  Hello?  Hello?  Go ahead, Rod.  Yeah, I was just curious.  Does dolphin veg smell like cumin?  I think we just found a new bit for the show, though, though. 
[02:27:30]  Pistols blazing.  I'll blow the smoke off.  Back in the holster.  Howie from Buffalo says, gives a whole new meaning to getting the fish eye.  That's funny.  They're not fish, they're mammals.  Right. 
[02:28:00]  How long should you wait before you call the dolphin after banging it?  Interesting question.  Hey, Chris is on line 11.  He said he banged an animal once.  Hey, what's up, guys?  I had kind of sex relations with an animal, too.  Yeah.  Contestant number 15, DeVita, from the Naughty Nighty contest.  Yeah.  Let's forget about that.  It's not very nice at all.  Yeah.  All right. 
[02:28:30]  I believe it.  Ozzy.  Ozzy's been waiting this whole time.  We'll talk to him next.  Obi and Anthony.  And on the eighth day, God said, let there be breasts.  Boobs.  Wow.  The Anthony Show.  102.7.  WNEW.  They're checking out the O&A Show.  Two cities will not be checking out the O&A Show.  Yes.  In the very near future.  So Ozzy Osbourne. 
[02:29:00]  The Osbourne's last night on MTV.  Hilarious.  Yes.  Effing hilarious.  Let me say something quick.  I'm just like, I could give a flying crap if Don and Mike talked about the dolphin thing six months ago.  I don't listen to Don and Mike.  And based on New York ratings, no one else does.  So that was the first time they heard it, too.  Okay?  Enough.  Dude, get out of this.  They talked about it already six months ago. 
[02:29:30]  Who cares?  Why would I care?  So what?  I can't bring something up that someone else talked about months ago?  What is it?  Is that like something you're not supposed to do?  I found it interesting.  So I talk about it.  I don't listen.  I don't know anyone that's talking about it.  So what the hell?  Who cares?  God, relax.  There's like five people emailing me.  Dude.  Dude.  Oh.  Dude. 
[02:30:00]  What are you doing?  I'm talking about a website I found interesting.  First, I'm hearing about it.  Look, I'm sure Don...  What a bunch of jackasses.  I'm sure Don and Mike have talked about threesomes.  What is Anthony supposed to do?  Not live his life?  Right.  All right.  The Osboards last night.  Oh, my.  Oh, Audie Murphy used to do that in the old cowboy movies. 
[02:30:30]  What are you doing?  So, all right.  There you go.  We talked about the Osboards.  Let's move on to something else.  Sharon!  Sharon, I'm not going to do it.  I'm not going to do it.  Opie brought up a great point in the office.  We have to, as responsible citizens...  Yeah, we want to call Child Services.  Yeah, call Child Protective Services to take Ozzy out of that house. 
[02:31:00]  Because there's an abused child.  Ozzy is being abused by Sharon.  That's all I can see from watching the Osboards.  Right.  This poor son of a bitch just wants to sit and draw his little pictures.  I'm drawing you, Sharon.  He wants to draw.  And he wants to rock.  He wants to rock and roll.  That's all.  He doesn't want the rocket sled.  That rocket sled rock.  He doesn't want the cannon to shoot at the audience.  How cool would it have been if you went to an Ozzy show and he comes in on a rocket sled. 
[02:31:30]  The rocket sled.  Looking like the Grinch.  And he certainly didn't want the bubbles.  No.  He's the Prince of Darkness, man.  Right.  He did not want bubbles.  And I felt bad for him.  But the biggest thing, they had his tour.  His tour was starting up.  They had his itinerary for all the various cities that he's going to be playing in.  And he's, as he puts it, you know, he's not a kid anymore.  He's an older gentleman.  He's in his 50s.  He's 53.  He can't do back-to-back nights. 
[02:32:00]  He was saying he wants one day on, one day off.  He can't do back-to-back nights because it blows his throat out.  But Sharon had booked a few nights that were back-to-back.  And Ozzy's just pleading.  He's like, I'm not going to do it.  I'm not going to do it.  This very next scene is Ozzy at all these various dates saying, hello, Albuquerque.  Yeah, hello, Albuquerque.  I'm not doing the Albuquerque date.  I won't do it, Sharon.  Sharon.  And then the preview for next week's great because he looks like he broke his foot or something. 
[02:32:30]  And now he's hobbling with a cane just yelling, Sharon.  You feel so bad for the guy.  TJ.  Yo, what's up, guys?  What's up?  Yo, how great was Ozzy's face when he lit that rocket launcher on the sled?  Classic.  Oh, yeah.  I was laughing my ass off.  Can I blow something for people?  Yeah.  I didn't even see the Osboys last night.  It wasn't Ozzy and the sled coming out.  No?  No, it was not him. 
[02:33:00]  Maybe he won a battle.  No, no, it wasn't Ozzy because I know that because when I saw them in Jersey,  I actually got backstage.  You mean they got a guy that dresses up like Ozzy?  Just like Ozzy because they played a joke on the guy.  And they told us.  This guy told us before it was going to happen.  But what they did was instead of landing and then the guy getting out like in the darkness  and the real Ozzy coming out, they left the guy hanging and people just threw water balloons  at him.  And Ozzy was throwing water balloons at Ozzy.  At the fake Ozzy.  I saw him doing it.  That's funny.  That's very funny.  So it's not Ozzy. 
[02:33:30]  The best part of last night.  They can't risk that greatest rocker in history falling.  Right.  The best part of last night was him lip syncing Moulin Rouge.  Yeah.  He couldn't say it.  He was dressed up like Christina Aguilera.  He had the same get up on and the hair and makeup and everything.  And he's dancing around in front of a green screen, which I guess things were put in later.  And they have to have him lip sync some of these words.  And he couldn't do it. 
[02:34:00]  One of the women gave a line.  He was to repeat it.  And he just couldn't do it because he's Ozzy.  I think we have that audio.  Let's go to it.  We're going to lip sync some of the words.  C'est ce soir.  C'est ce soir.  Okay.  Mocha chocolata ya ya.  Mocha chocolata ya ya.  Mocha chocolata ya ya.  What the f***?  It's like Tony.  Oh, I didn't have a drink.  Drink at the f***ing Starbucks.  It's the best.  We got to hear the bubbles line real fast, too. 
[02:34:30]  Ozzy from last night.  No, I don't care.  I have to be on the f***ing stage two nights from now.  I don't want to use them f***ing bubbles, them f***ing stupid cannons.  I don't have this f***ing stupid f***ing Santa Claus machine laying on the f***ing stage.  I just want to play rock and roll, man.  Well, what are you going to do about it?  I'm going to get up for it.  I was just certainly saying, I can't have all this f***ing.  What is it out, man?  When has it not been?  When has it not been?  Oh, God, he was pissed. 
[02:35:00]  He's the greatest.  He was pissed.  And, of course, the highlight of last night on the Osborne that Mark has.  And, Mark.  Hey, guys.  Hey, man.  At the very end, I just thought it was too funny when he walked away.  Whoa, whoa, hey, hey.  Whoa, whoa.  Hey, Mark.  Mark.  We have a shuttle launch.  What the hell is that?  Right here.  Go ahead, Mark.  No, at the very end, when he walked away all P.O.'d and sat in that chair and just fell right on his back.  Yeah.  And his feet went in the air.  He sits on one of those little director's chairs, and he's in the background of the shot. 
[02:35:30]  They're still talking to people in the living room, and he's kind of in a side room down the hall, but you can still see him.  And he sits in the chair and just falls over backwards, his feet sticking up.  I lost it, man.  I was dying when that happened.  Ozzy's falling and he can't get up.  I'm falling and I can't get up, Sharon.  Thank God he wasn't hurt.  That's when I hit my live call that my son Jack bought me.  Well, let's talk to the man. 
[02:36:00]  Where is Ozzy?  Ozzy!  Hello, it's Ozzy Osbourne.  I've had fun and I can't get up, but I did get up, you know.  And, you know, something happened last night that they obviously couldn't put in the show, you know.  If I can, I'll tell you about it.  I got tired of having people cut my lawn, so I decided to cut my lawn, you know.  So I threw on a nice wife's beard and, you know, a pair of boxer shorts. 
[02:36:30]  So, you know how the boxer shorts have the slit in the front?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, so I guess my neighbors, not the ones with the loud music, or the other neighbors,  they saw I was cutting my lawn and I come out, you know, they're talking to me as I'm cutting my lawn.  And I guess the slit lined up perfectly, you know.  And out comes all my junk, you know, right in front of the neighbors.  And, you know, they got a little upset, you know, but they couldn't put it on the show, man. 
[02:37:00]  Little Ozzy came out.  Little Ozzy.  Little Ozzy, come on, man.  You know, I'm a rock star, you know.  Oh, you looked like one last night with all the ladies' clothes on there, Oz.  Yeah, you know, unfortunately I asked for itineraries and I got one and, you know, it involved cross-dressing, you know.  That was all for Jimmy Norton, though.  You know, because I love him.  I actually wrote a little two-line jingle for Jimmy if you'd like to hear it. 
[02:37:30]  Oh, let's hear it, Ozzy.  Oh, sure.  When I look into the sky, I see the color yellow.  Now, this whitening color that I see is Jimmy Norton dripping with yellow glee.  I mean, no, before Chris Pringle goes nuts with the dumb button, I just wanted to tell you, I said glee, not the letter C. 
[02:38:00]  Right, right, it was glee.  It was glee.  I got you, Ozzy.  Hey, Ozzy, you're with it today.  Thank you.  I don't know, no problem, you know, I'd do it all for you, you know.  Ah, man.  Very good.  So, what's up with the bubble machine?  You don't like the bubbles, Oz?  I hate the goddamn bubbles, you know.  It's like the good witch in The Wizard of Oz is coming, you know.  I don't want to have anything to do with the bubbles, you know. 
[02:38:30]  I want fire and brimstone and things like that.  Right, right.  Of course.  More like Ozzy, not like Lawrence Welk.  Sure, you understand.  Absolutely.  And Oz, the wife and daughter shopping like crazy last night on the episode.  Yeah, I got to tell you, I tried to use that same credit card.  And, you know, I brought it up to a line, you know, and there's a lot of people.  I bought a bunch of stuff, but it said it was declining, you know. 
[02:39:00]  There's $100,000 in that goddamn card.  They used it all, you know.  Oh, you know, never again, man.  They're getting their own cards, you know.  You're in hell, Ozzy.  It's not that bad, you know.  Hey, Oz, do you want us to call Protective Services?  You seem like an abused child in that house.  I actually called them once myself, and they thought I was joking, so I don't think it'll work, guys. 
[02:39:30]  Tell us where they touched you.  They touched me.  Well, they touched me in places I wouldn't talk about at parties, you know.  Right, right.  I was very interested to find out that my wife, Sharon, you know, she has a scrotum, apparently, you know.  Yeah, she's got some set.  Yeah.  But, you know, it's all fun, you know.  I'm not really, you know, being abused, you know. 
[02:40:00]  I'm okay.  Thanks for the concern.  Good to hear, yeah.  Hey, we liked that rocket sled last night, too, Oz.  Oh, you like the rockets.  You know, it was fun, you know, shooting it off himself in the second world.  He was laughing a lot, you know, watching me floating around, shooting, you know, play rockets, you know.  It was fun, you know.  Hey, Oz, are you calling us from your helicopter?  Oh, exactly.  Because we're losing your phone call here, Oz.  Right.  I'm actually touching down in St. James, I'm brought to you live from my helicopter. 
[02:40:30]  And, you know, I thought I'd drop you guys a line, you know, because I love you guys.  All right, Oz.  Thank you, Ozzy.  Thank you so much.  Sure, guys.  Bye, Ozzy.  All right, I'll see you later.  All right, there he goes, Ozzy Osbourne.  Cut off Ozzy, you ass.  Wow.  All right, Ant.  That was pretty funny.  I like the song.

It's time to play What Did We Learned on The Opie and Anthony Show today. 
[02:42:30]  Get right to it.  Steve, what's going on today?  Hey!  Hoy!  Hello.  Hey.  What's up, guys?  What's up, Steve?  The thing I learned today, the thing that guys do wrong the most when having sex with women is not bury the body deep enough.  That's what they're doing.  Yep.  Very good, bro.  All right.  Let's go to Martin.  Martin!  Martin.  Yes.  God. 
[02:43:00]  Dude, you guys are killing us, man.  You are slow motion today.  We come out of the commercials with this.  We're rocking.  You've got to be with us.  Let's go.  All right.  I learned two things today, gentlemen.  First of all, I learned that no dolphins were wrong during sex.  Yep.  Number two, women dolphins give the best hummers.  Women dolphins give the best hummers.  Ah, give the best hummers.  Ah, ah, ah.  Very good.  I don't think that was recommended.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Let's go to Awesome Andy.  Hey, what's up, guys?  What's up, Awesome Andy? 
[02:43:30]  Hey, I learned that there's no studio masseuse at the ESPN.  Hey, Norton.  He's not.  I'll see you at Avalon in Boston on Friday, a meaty breast and nothing.  Don't forget, we're broadcasting live.  I'll be up front.  Oh, cool, man.  Later, guys.  You guys rule.  At BCN in Boston.  Come on.  And there's always a party going on outside the studios.  Yes.  There's been guys hanging out there every Wednesday.  I know.  Through the whole winter, doing the whole wow thing.  Yeah, station got some, like, pizza and stuff, and they hang out there trying to get girls 
[02:44:00]  to wow them.  Oogie Pringles Ghost, what's going on?  Yeah, what's going on?  Hey.  Yeah, well, I guess what I learned.  What?  Oh, I learned how to flog a dolphin.  Yeah.  I learned a lot about dolphins today.  Yeah.  Very good.  They're friendly, playful creatures.  Let's go to Rob.  Rob, what did you learn on the show today?  I learned two things today, you guys.  I learned one that I need to get a summer job at SeaWorld, and two that Jay Moore is a  homo.  Oh, that's it.  Yeah.  Oh.  Oh.  Feels good. 
[02:44:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Get my thigh.  He's insane, man.  Tom from Philly.  I learned today Norton has a new CBS show called Touched by an Uncle.  Sheep lover, I learned today Wichita, Kansas is a good city for corn and incest.  Jerry from Edison, I learned leak and release is not about one of Norton's dates.  Being number one in Wichita is the same as being 35th in Yemen.  He also learned my wife won't let me swim in the ocean alone anymore.  And finally, if you're going to have sex with a dolphin, avoid Das Duke Pierre. 
[02:45:00]  Don't let Das Dolphin get into Das Dompuyari.  It could kill you.  Not in Das Dompuyari.  Not in the Sydney Poitier.  Let's think of the same thing, the Das Potty.  Sydney Potter Potty.  Potter Potty.  All right.  I'm hanging up on people.  Don't get insulted.  Dennis, what's going on?  What's going on, guys?  Hey.  I learned dolphins can be considered black.  Uh, yeah. 
[02:45:30]  He did the...  I love when we discover something new on the show and you just know it's going to work.  Holster that weapon.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That might have been a bang, bang.  Quick release there.  Bang, bang.  Chuck, what's up?  Hey.  I learned Ozzy is an abused child.  Yes.  And Norton rules always.  Thanks, mister.  You guys kick A.  All right.  Thank you. 
[02:46:00]  Thanks, man.  Oh, sugar.  Didn't get him.  It's like my grandma would say, oh, sugar.  And then she'd say, why are you putting your fist into my cheekbone?  In that order.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Uh, I learned today if you have, uh, manual leaves with a male, uh, dolphin, it's not on  porpoise.  Uh, Jim Norton likes to hear that he stinks.  And, uh, bing, bing, bing.  But, yeah, it's like a huge.  Stink, Norton. 
[02:46:30]  All right.  All right.  Oof.  Oof.  Yeah, just...  Don't eat, uh, tuna.  Oh, oh, don't buy dolphin-safe tuna, especially if the dolphin already has mayo in it.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Joe from WBCN, who runs the board, uh, for us up there in Boston.  What's up, bro?  What's going on, guys?  Hey.  Can't wait for Friday.  Yeah.  I learned a few things today.  Looking forward to it.  You kind of, Joe.  I learned Welcome to the Jungle is not about Boston.  Yeah.  Playmates can't fly kites.  And I learned way too much about dolphins today. 
[02:47:00]  Yeah, I think we all did.  Very good, man.  All right.  Bye.  See you Friday.  Bye.  Bye.  Uh, Scott, what did you learn today?  I learned that everybody in Vegas lives in a casino.  You know?  And Norton likes to plant his fist in his grandma's cheeks.  Thanks, Juicy C.  Thank you.  What's wrong with you?  Oh, my God.  You whippers are hilarious. 
[02:47:30]  Brandon, go ahead.  Hey, what's going on, fellas?  Hey.  Hey, I learned that Gabe Markman made it through another cold season.  See you later, Spaniac.  Bang, bang.  That was a good one.  Steve, what's up?  Hey, what's up, boys?  Great show.  Thanks.  I learned you know if your girl's cheating on you if she comes home with crisp hard apple breath. 
[02:48:00]  I also learned it's not gay if you don't make eye contact.  And dolphins have taints, too.  Yes, they do.  Later, boys.  Good job, bro.  The most tender part of the dolphin.  Yeah.  The taint area.  Smells like fish and mushroom.  Get that elbow out of my rib.  Tony.  Good elbow in me.  Tony, what's up?  Hey.  Hey.  I learned that Kiana has never seen the movie Stripes. 
[02:48:30]  Without a doubt.  Yeah.  She was clueless.  Very good, bro.  All right.  See you later.  All right, man.  That's funny.  Let's go to Rich.  Oh, Rich had a great one.  He hung up.  He learned that he needs a bigger aquarium.  Yeah, if you're in your home aquarium trying to bag your garami, it's going to be a problem.  Colin, what's up?  Hey, what's up?  I didn't catch the ESPN show last night, but you guys recapped me on it all.  Yeah.  Jay Moore did get a chubby? 
[02:49:00]  No, he did not.  Yes, he did pitch his tent?  No, he did not.  He doesn't know.  He's confused.  Yes, that is true.  Thank you.  Sheep lover.  I learned today you can give the pinch pot mud works to a dolphin, but she might break  your nose with her finger.  The pinch pot mud works.  That shows its ugly head again.  That was the rusty trombone for the woman.  You know the rusty trombone?  Of course.  It's where the girl is licking the balloon knot, but with the reach around, she works 
[02:49:30]  your junk like a little slide trombone.  And then the pinch pot mud works is the same thing, only you reach around and you pinch  the honey pot.  Oh, the pinch pot mud works.  The greatest one I heard, I think it was the chili dog.  Oh, yeah.  It's where you have a diarrhea.  Can you say that?  No, now that probably affects what you can now say. 
[02:50:00]  How about, can you say?  How about you clean up and try tomorrow, because we're running out of time.  All right, you know what?  You're right.  I apologize.  That will just get one.  I cocked, but I couldn't fire.  Go home and reload.  Get home safe, everyone.  Godspeed.  That's probably from Columbus, right?  Dolphins are an average of 12 inches, and as Opie would say, it's a stereotype they don't  mind.  All right.  Right.  I use that one a lot.  I'm sure.  Bro.  All right.  Ron and Fez up next here in New York.  Yes.  Thank you.  We'll see you guys tomorrow. 
[02:50:30]  And don't forget, Friday, broadcasting live from WBCN in Boston.  There should be a party going on on the sidewalk once again.  Look at Ben freaking out.  You all right?  Yes, you are.  You're making a button-pushing, like, thing.  Like, when you push the other.  Get that.  Oh, look.  Look, you just.  Oh.  All right.  We'll end with Steve, though, because it relates back to yesterday.  We like wrapping things up.  Steve, go ahead.  Oh, wait.  Hold on.  Go ahead, Steve.  What's up, guys? 
[02:51:00]  Hey.  I learned that you're out of brewing a bit, so you can cut out of there early.  All right, man.  We got it.  Thanks, bud.  I'm sure we fooled someone. </pre>
