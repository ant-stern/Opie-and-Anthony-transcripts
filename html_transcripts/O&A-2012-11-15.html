<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opens with an announcement of an upcoming E-Rock audio/jingle contest, the results of which would be revealed later.  Opie then launches into a lengthy, vulgar rant about a negative experience with a female echocardiogram technician who he describes using highly offensive terms ("cunt," "bitch") while detailing her unprofessional demeanor and dismissive attitude towards him and his distressed infant daughter. He graphically describes her appearance, including inappropriate comments about her body.  This leads to a discussion about listener experiences with medical professionals, both positive and negative.

The conversation abruptly shifts to the unfolding David Petraeus scandal, with the hosts employing crude humor to dissect the affair involving Petraeus, Paula Broadwell, and Jill Kelley. They reference a flow chart summarizing the complex relationships and the involvement of General John Allen, focusing on the threatening emails, sexually explicit correspondence, and the discovery of classified information.  They connect this to their own past run-in with the FBI following a prank, describing the ransacking of their office.  A caller, Charlotte, a medical professional, advises Opie to formally complain about the technician.

The show continues with discussion of a suicide note in Key West, Florida, reading "do not revive, fuck Obama," prompting speculation on the deceased's motivations, particularly the potential conflict between his political views and his same-sex relationship.  A former producer, "Stunt Brain," calls in to provide detailed insider information on the Petraeus scandal, covering Broadwell's security clearance issues and Jill Kelley's alleged attempt to claim diplomatic immunity. The hosts then discuss their poorly selling Dallas stand-up shows before returning to the Petraeus scandal with more speculation and jokes.  Comedian Colin Quinn unexpectedly calls in, jokingly complaining about a work offer from Anthony, leading to a brief comedic exchange about the offer and Quinn’s comedic style.  Dice Clay's involvement in a Woody Allen movie is briefly mentioned.

The show moves on to the results of the E-Rock jingle contest.  Several entries are played and critiqued, with a focus on E-Rock's own entries and the voting process, revealing E-Rock cast two votes.  The hosts re-tally the votes excluding E-Rock's, ultimately declaring a different entry as the "moral victor," awarding a $500 gift card. A smaller wrestling-themed contest featuring Don Morocco is briefly mentioned.  The hosts recall Pendulet as a well-received previous guest and remember Patrice O'Neal and a newly released posthumous stand-up album.

A significant portion of the broadcast focuses on a heated debate about the ethics of using a XIM Edge (mistakenly referred to as "Zim" multiple times) device with an Xbox 360 in Call of Duty.  The discussion features listener-submitted audio entries for a contest, many mocking E-Rock's weight and appearance with offensive language. Anthony’s use of the XIM Edge to improve his gameplay sparks a debate with Opie and callers about whether it constitutes cheating.  Arguments revolve around fairness and the difference between console and PC gaming.  Anthony defends his use, while Opie and callers argue it creates an unfair advantage.  The debate concludes without resolution.  Tangential discussions include a Thanksgiving-themed song and other unrelated topics.

The XIM Edge debate continues in the next segment, with Eric the intern joining the conversation. Anthony continues to defend his use of the device, emphasizing enhanced enjoyment.  The conversation tangents into various aspects of Call of Duty, including play styles and controller difficulties.  Anthony’s gamer tag, "Noodles 61," is mentioned, and listeners are encouraged to actively challenge him in-game. Comedian Jimmy Norris calls to promote his Dallas shows.  The discussion then shifts to Jon Bon Jovi's daughter's suspected heroin overdose, followed by calls from individuals sharing their experiences with addiction and their upbringings, including Anthony’s own anecdote regarding his Vicodin prescription.  The conversation circles back to Call of Duty with a humorous anecdote about a child's tantrum. The show concludes with discussions about time travel, the Kennedy assassination, a bizarre story about a caller's experience during the Hudson River plane landing, interspersed with a recurring nonsensical phrase ("I can't believe I never knew how pretty you are, standing there looking all pretty and shit"). The show closes with discussions about the purchase price of Manhattan and a promotion for Steven Singer Jewelers.

The final segment features Jesse May Peluso and Sal as in-studio guests.  Peluso discusses her comedy tours in the Dominican Republic and Norway, highlighting cultural differences in audience reactions.  Sal's nickname, "Sex Bagel," is briefly discussed.  A caller shares a sexually explicit anecdote, leading to further banter involving vacuum cleaners and chickens.  Listeners attempt to win a video game, sparking more off-color jokes and discussions about its Chinese origins.  A substantial portion is devoted to Eric's upcoming debut show, "Bageling with the Sex," with Sal as executive producer.  Their strained relationship and Eric's secretive planning are discussed, including speculation about a mysterious guest (potentially Joel McHale or Jimmy Kimmel).  There is also discussion of Eric's perceived lack of collaboration with Sal, and accusations of poor work ethic directed at Sal.  The conversation touches upon a negative New York Times review of Guy Fieri’s restaurant, Peluso's past rivalry with Fieri, and her experiences on reality TV, exposing the staged nature of these shows.  The segment concludes with a promotion for Steven Singer Jewelers, using the website IHateStevenSinger.com.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  but enough of this palaver let's get the show on the road good morning hi good morning  look at everybody piggy piggy piggy piggy piggy look at everyone out there driving to work  piggy piggy piggy piggy piggy piggy how does that one go i like that one we got a crown of winner  today piggy piggy piggy piggy oh travis has the winners in his hand you're not gonna let us know  who won the E-Rock Audio  slash Jingle Contest. 
[00:00:30]  When are we doing it?  Soon?  Everyone.  I'm not sure if I'm happy  with my vote.  I don't know what  anybody else voted.  Oh, well, Jimmy.  You could not be happy  with your vote.  I just thought about it  a lot yesterday.  I'm not happy  with the nation's vote.  You could revote.  You can always change your vote.  You know what's tough  is that they were all winners.  They really were good.  We'll do it a little later.  All right.  God damn.  Do I tell part of that story? 
[00:01:00]  It's 615.  Do I tell part of that story?  Is it too boring?  What?  The kid thing.  No, it's like you...  I'll make it quick.  You go through.  It's life experience.  I had to take my six-week-old  to a cardiologist yesterday.  Oh, man.  Downright horrified.  Going into it, to be fair,  I'm not like...  I don't want to oversell this.  My pediatrician said...  This is something  a lot of parents  have to deal with.  They're like,  we think it's this,  which would be no big deal, 
[00:01:30]  but just to be safe,  let's get our heart checked.  But I like spreading  that insurance money around  to all the rest  of my doctor colleagues,  so let's send out  for a few tests.  I like your translation,  because you know what?  I guarantee part of that  plays into it.  So you're right.  But also,  but what do you do?  Like, well,  if you think it's no big deal,  let's go with the no big deal.  Right.  So we don't have to deal  with going to a cardiologist  with a six-week-old.  That's craziness.  But of course,  you got to do that  just to be on the safe side. 
[00:02:00]  So I was at the cardiologist  for about three hours yesterday.  And the story  is not really about my kid  and the cardiologist,  because in the end,  everything's fine.  In the end,  everything checked out fine.  I just had to go through  this fucking bullshit, right?  Yeah.  Which a lot of parents go through.  Yeah.  But it's about  the fucking technician  at this fucking place.  And I'm going to say  fuck a lot.  Like, I don't expect people  to, like,  handle my kid with,  you know,  kid gloves.  I get it.  But we got an EKG, 
[00:02:30]  and one of the ladies  that did the EKG,  because that's a basic test,  she was cool.  She saw the worry  on our faces,  and she goes,  and she lets us off the hook.  She goes,  I'm not supposed to say,  but the EKG looks really good.  Oh, there you go.  And the EKG is really important,  as we all know.  Sure.  You could do other testing,  but the EKG does say a lot.  So we're like,  all right,  we're a little relieved here,  you know?  And then we deal  with a pediatrician  and the cardiologist himself,  and then he's like,  well, let's do an echocardiogram 
[00:03:00]  just to be safe.  You're here.  Like, all right.  So we go into the area  where that is being done  and this lady right off the bat,  this cunt,  and the story is about her,  was beyond annoyed  that she had to do the test  at that moment in time.  I don't know if she had  a lunch break going on,  or she was filling in  for someone quickly,  and they were supposed  to be back,  but she basically  kind of grabbed the equipment  in an aggressive way, 
[00:03:30]  not around my kid,  but just to get ready  for the test,  and she was huffing and puffing.  Was she a nurse?  They're like techs.  Tech, yeah.  Yeah, they're techs.  They do these tests.  That's what they do.  They go to work  and they do these tests  a million times.  They do the tests  and then the doctor  translates the info.  And they see a lot of kids.  To them, of course,  it's a nameless, faceless person.  Of course.  I get all that.  I really do.  So then we lay down  our daughter, six weeks old,  just in a diaper.  She doesn't even warm up 
[00:04:00]  the freaking thing they use.  Really?  The little sensory thing?  Just puts it on her chest.  Puts it on her chest  in a way where  if it was just this much  fucking harder,  I would have strangled her.  I would have strangled her.  And she's doing the test  and she's looking at her watch  and she's looking out  of the fucking room.  And we're sitting there like,  you're looking at my kid's  heart chamber right now.  Could you have  just a little respect, please?  Part of their job  is to put the people  a little bit at ease. 
[00:04:30]  Not even put them at ease,  but don't make it  any more stressful  than it has to be.  It's an incredibly stressful thing.  Because you don't know  what the fuck.  You don't have the clear  from the doctor yet.  And she's just  going through.  And then  we mentioned,  we reference our daughter  and she goes,  oh, it's a girl?  And my,  I mean,  you can make all the jokes  you want,  but my baby looks like a girl.  But she's not really  paying attention.  She goes, 
[00:05:00]  oh, I thought it was a boy.  And then gets really mad  because I guess she has  to start the test  over again.  Even though she was  halfway through it  because I guess,  I don't know,  I guess the heart's different  in men and women.  I don't even know.  Do you know?  I wouldn't know  why that would make  a difference.  Oh, but it made a difference.  I guess they must key it in  or something.  Right.  So she's like annoyed  because now she obviously  doesn't want to be doing  this particular test  because whoever the fuck  was supposed to do it  wasn't there.  So she has to start over.  So of course,  almost aggressively,  she's starting the test over.  She has to punch in 
[00:05:30]  all the fucking buttons again.  So then,  we do what every single person  that is hearing my voice does.  You're going through  one of these tests,  whether it's you  or whether it's for your kid,  you go,  how does it look?  Because you're out of your mind.  Right.  Because you don't want  to go in the waiting room,  wait for the doctor  to get the test  and then go into his office  and have that dramatic moment.  It's happening right there.  And these techs,  even though they're not doctors,  oh, they know exactly  what's going on.  Yeah.  They're not stupid.  She turns to us 
[00:06:00]  and she couldn't wait  to say this,  almost with a smile on her face.  Oh, I can't tell you.  The doctor will be with you  after the test is done.  Then kind of gave one of these  like smiles  and went back to the test.  She could have just said like,  it doesn't look like  there's anything to worry about.  Right.  Something.  But I can't say for sure.  These techs,  most of them are cool.  We've all been through it.  I would say eight out of 10  will go.  Yeah.  You know what?  I'm not a doctor,  but it's looking pretty good.  You know, 
[00:06:30]  but I'm not the doctor.  You know,  they protect themselves.  Yeah.  But she couldn't wait  to say that.  Couldn't wait.  And then, you know,  my kid, six weeks old,  is crying a little bit.  She's like,  do you have a pacifier or something?  She's just so annoyed.  Jesus Christ.  It's their job.  What a cunt.  And I got my son  who's about two and a half now.  Your son.  And he's exhausted  because we've been there  at this point  about two,  two and a half hours.  So he's kind of starting  his acting up,  you know,  normal shit.  So I just,  I just take him  out of the fucking room, 
[00:07:00]  A,  to calm him down,  and B,  because I was ready  to lose my shit  in a way I,  in a way that wouldn't  have been good.  Just unload on her.  Yeah.  And she had  fuck me heels on  and the tightest pants ever,  which I would have enjoyed  if she wasn't such a cunt.  Was she pretty?  No,  she was a butter face.  Nice body though.  Yeah,  I told my wife,  I go,  you know,  those pants were so tight  when she bent over  for something,  I actually did see  her pussy lips. 
[00:07:30]  Oh,  you've turned me around.  And I told my wife that.  I'm like,  you know,  and then of course  I have to throw in  who goes to work like that  for a cardiologist.  Were they big lips?  I mean,  I don't know  the point of the story,  but I'm sure.  Digress for a moment.  The whole plot  of the story  has now changed  to her plump pussy lips.  They're kind of like  corduroy,  like kind of like  fucking pants  and just enough,  just a little whoop.  All right, 
[00:08:00]  so if you're tuning in late,  there was just this,  this really,  this nice lady  was bothered  by this awful couple.  I don't know,  you know,  just,  I don't,  I don't even know  why I'm telling the story.  I guess because maybe  people can relate.  You go through a situation,  they know you're in a situation  because they do this  for a living  and they have complete control  of your emotions  and your fears.  Yeah,  they got to realize  that the parents  got to be freaking out in there  and they got to  keep conscious of that.  When she looked at her watch 
[00:08:30]  a couple times,  you know,  she wasn't officially sighing,  but it was like  just short of sighing.  She had a better place to be  and,  you know,  whether it's true or not,  the parent doesn't want to think  that,  you know,  they have anything more important  to do than that moment right there.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Thank you.  A monster like you  even knows that.  I'm kidding.  I'm kidding.  But when it's something  that sensitive,  for them it's daily routine,  but for regular,  for people it's not.  Look,  most people don't go in there  and have their own heart  or a baby's heart checked.  They do 10 of those tests a day, 
[00:09:00]  but it's not like  you bring in 10 kids a day  to have their fucking hearts checked.  Right,  right.  Yeah,  yeah,  it's,  it's,  it's,  I think it's a delicate balance  because,  yeah,  to them,  they don't give a fuck  if there's anything wrong  with your kid.  I get that.  I see a million people  walking on the streets every day.  I don't give a fuck  what's going on in their lives,  but you're in a position  where you got to kind of  balance that out  and figure it out a little bit,  I think,  right?  It,  it matters a lot.  I had,  I had to talk to a doctor yesterday,  you know,  more apnea nonsense.  And this guy has talked to me  a few times  and I spent 10 minutes 
[00:09:30]  on the phone with him.  And as we're hanging up,  I said,  you know,  thanks man.  I said,  you're a good doctor.  Thanks for talking to me.  It's all it took was the idea  that he gave a little bit of time  and,  and talked to you  and didn't blow you off  like you're a number in the system.  And that's all you ask for.  And I say that every fucking time  when I have a good experience.  The cardiologist himself  was amazing.  And I told him that.  I told him how great he was.  And I didn't,  I didn't rat her out.  I don't even know why.  Yeah.  I still might call today  to be honest with you.  Yeah.  I was so fucking annoyed.  I'm not,  I'm not one of those guys 
[00:10:00]  that,  you know,  calls and fucking tries  to get people in trouble.  But this was over the top,  man.  Always tell them  if they're a good doctor.  Like,  I always do.  And I go,  you don't,  I hope you understand.  This means a lot to people  when you give them that moment.  Yeah.  You know,  the doctor that we shared  for a while,  I stopped going to her  because she,  she gave,  she,  she gave me an EKG once,  right?  And I go,  so what is it saying?  She goes,  oh,  it's saying heart attack  and then leaves the room.  And leaves the room. 
[00:10:30]  I think I had stopped breathing.  And then she came back in  because I,  I forgot what she had to do,  but she had to leave it that moment.  She goes,  oh,  it's saying heart attack.  And then she goes back in  and goes,  but,  but the machine is usually  95% wrong  as far as that part  of the test goes.  You fucking.  But she says that  after the fact  and long story short,  I didn't have a heart attack.  I have an acid reflux issue.  What a bitch.  She's the worst.  Thank you.  Jimmy knows.  She's a beautiful  Russian.  I don't know  if she's beautiful anymore.  It's been a couple years now.  I go elsewhere. 
[00:11:00]  But she's the one  I used to talk about.  She would walk in  really sexy  with the white blouse  that's down.  The buttons are down  a little too far.  You can see the bra  and she has the skirts  and she kind of,  when she's talking,  she almost is like  twirling her hair  as she gets  the basic information.  Not far fetched  from that.  Not far fetched  from the nurse fantasy shit  that you see.  Yeah,  she was kind of sexy  but her bedside matters.  It's like Club Soda Kenny  if he were a blonde  Russian woman.  I don't think she was even a,  oh, we know her. 
[00:11:30]  That's her.  Is that, let me see.  That's a,  what's her name?  Is that Victoria?  Yeah, we know her.  She's been in.  Dr. Z.  Dr. Z.  That's Dr. Z.  I think so.  No way.  That's her old.  She looks a lot better  right there.  Well, look at her face closely.  I'm going to bet money  that's her.  That looks like her to me.  She's not a bitch though,  Jimmy.  Some,  all I'm going to say  and we've said it on the show  that some of these Russians  that are now living  in our country  have a very,  very,  I'll use the word  stoic personality. 
[00:12:00]  Yeah,  they're different.  They're not aware  they're not being  bitchy.  That's just how they are.  That's how they are.  That's how they give information.  Right.  It is what it is.  You know,  and you know,  whatever.  Like I said,  it's a fine balance.  So unfortunately,  I fucking missed Oliver Stone  yesterday.  I fucking pissed off.  Yeah,  that was cool.  He's a boy,  he's a little out there.  He's nutty,  but I think he smokes  a lot of pot,  but he had fun.  Really?  I wish we had more time  with him.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That went very quickly.  But Roland said 
[00:12:30]  when he was leaving  that he was saying  like how much he liked it  and he wanted to come back.  He's like,  those guys are great.  They read the book  or they knew  the documentary.  Like he was happy  that we talked about  the actual movies.  We didn't talk about  his movies at all,  which was like fun.  I know,  right?  Yeah.  There's so many  to talk about.  I know.  The time just went  so fast,  yeah.  Of course,  someone has to ask  was the lady black?  No.  No.  Matter of fact,  guess what?  Guess what?  The black lady,  if you need to know,  you racist dicks,  was the nice one  in this office.  Oh.  She was the one  that said, 
[00:13:00]  look,  you know,  I'm not supposed to say  but the EKG  looks really good.  So where is Bizarro  a cardiology company?  Exactly.  Where is this friendly  nurse allegedly?  It was the white broad.  If she could chew gum  there,  she would have.  She would have been  snapping gum  as she did her testing.  Great.  One of those.  One of those, man.  I was out of my,  I haven't run across  someone like that  in a while, man.  Yeah.  And when they're  dealing with your kid,  they got your kid  in their hands,  oh my God.  A brewer told me this  before I had kids. 
[00:13:30]  I was hanging out  with him at his house  once and I was,  I think my wife  was pregnant at the time  and he goes,  the one thing  about being a parent  that you learn is  you officially know  you could murder somebody  and I didn't really  understand that at the time.  I thought that was,  wow, that was pretty dramatic  and it was Brewer  but it kind of sunk in  a little bit  but I'm like,  really?  You could actually  murder somebody?  As soon as that kid  pops out  and starts developing  and growing up  a little bit,  yeah,  you know you could  fucking kill somebody.  I have no doubt  it could kill someone now.  You understand  the karate instructor 
[00:14:00]  who shot that,  or the guy  who shot the karate instructor  in between the two,  all that shit.  But not even for that,  you know you could  probably kill someone  over something  that's a lot less than  a lot less than that.  You know,  God forbid,  happens to your kid.  A lot less.  You gotta really  control your shit.  So,  I'm a supervisor  for Echo  and Sonogram Department.  I would fire  that bitch immediately.  They're supposed  to be compassionate.  Yeah.  So,  do I turn into 
[00:14:30]  a dick today?  Because I really,  I'm not much of a dick  in my regular life.  She was the dick.  Do I call him?  Why not?  Just say,  look,  she really bugged me.  Why not?  Yeah.  She was awful.  It wasn't like  she didn't move  fast enough for my taste.  If she was being shitty,  then she would be  A lot of people are relating.  I had a daughter  open heart surgery  twice in five months.  I know you feel me.  As you go through  tech school,  you spend just as much time  with Bedside Manor.  You do.  I always wondered that  as you do learning  the actual technical stuff too. 
[00:15:00]  I've been told  the doctor will go over  stuff with you,  but I remember  a woman telling me  that nicely.  And I understand  why they can't  give you anything  because again,  they could read it wrong  or it could be  a whole fucking mess  or they could give you  positive news  when it shouldn't be.  Yeah.  But she was like,  oh no,  the doctor will go over.  It was a friendlier thing  as opposed to  a self-satisfied.  Yeah,  I know a lot of people  that do these  medical tech jobs  down in Philly. 
[00:15:30]  Not a lot,  but a handful.  And they know everything  because they see it  every day.  They see baby hearts  all day long.  They know exactly  where the defects are  and what they're looking for.  They know,  I'm telling you.  And a lot of them,  you've got to be careful.  There's a way to do it.  Sometimes,  sometimes they'll kind of  wink at you like,  well,  I'm not allowed to really,  you know,  I'm not allowed to say  and they almost give you  like a wink like,  but.  Yeah,  don't worry.  Yeah,  right.  Or they'll give you  the,  you know,  yeah,  yeah,  yeah,  yeah.  I don't want to.  Just in case,  like,  God forbid, 
[00:16:00]  she was completely wrong.  You can't like,  call her out on it  because she'll go,  no,  I'm just kind of smiling  at you.  Yeah.  I just want to talk  to one doctor  and then we can move on.  It's Charlotte.  What's an EKG?  I've heard of it,  but I've never given one.  You know,  that's why I love Dr. Steve  because,  you know,  we all,  we all have just dumb things  we want to ask doctors  and you can't get your  regular doctor on the phone  because they don't have time.  And Dr. Steve is one of these,  you know,  we beat the shit out of him.  I'll give him a huge compliment today.  He,  he has that bedside manner 
[00:16:30]  and we'll,  we'll talk to you  like a human fucking being,  you know?  Yeah,  he's knowledgeable too.  Right.  Considering his history  sexually of arrest,  he's a nice man.  Charlotte,  Dr. Baltimore,  what's going on?  Ooh,  Charlotte,  what's going on?  Hey,  Doc.  Hello.  I just wanted to say,  I work with a lot of techs  in my profession  in radiology  and you absolutely  should call  and tell the doctor  about her behavior.  It's not good  for patient care. 
[00:17:00]  It's not good  for the parent,  especially.  She shouldn't be  working with kids.  I work with adults.  I mean.  Well,  she,  she has an out  because like I said  during the story,  I hope you picked up on it.  There was nothing,  nothing I could,  I can't completely go,  she did this.  Yeah,  yeah.  You know what I mean?  It was just a vibe.  It was very obvious though.  What the looking at the watch,  the almost sighing,  the looking at the doorway  constantly,  like when is this?  Basically,  which we've all gone through  if you have a job,  you're like,  when is this fucking bitch 
[00:17:30]  coming back?  Because I don't want  to do your fucking job.  I get it.  Yeah,  but in medical care,  there's no room for that.  You're a parent,  you're worried.  It's the intangible stuff  that you can't put your finger on  that's the most important part of it.  Right.  In her job.  So,  completely unacceptable.  Call her out on it.  Call the doctor  because the other thing is,  you know,  the doctor probably doesn't even know  that she's acting like that  and any behavior she has,  results,  you know,  reflects on him.  Right. 
[00:18:00]  So,  you know,  you've got to do it.  Right.  She's probably got a power trip issue.  She's not a doctor,  but she's got a lot of control over you  and your situation.  She wanted to be,  you know,  somewhere else partying  or fucking blowing somebody,  I think.  But when the doctor got,  walked up to her,  like,  can you do this test?  She kind of gave him a quick attitude  but saw that we're in the room.  Yeah, yeah.  Like,  well,  Joan,  I forgot the name.  Joan,  but Joan,  where,  where's she,  she's supposed to be. 
[00:18:30]  And then the doctor's like,  well,  can you,  you know,  start the test?  They're waiting.  You know,  he,  he sees that,  holy fuck,  you know,  this family needs a little relief  as soon as I could give it to them,  but I can't give it to them  until I,  you know,  get all the test results back.  What a bitch.  All right,  Charlotte.  Sounds like you guys tell them.  And also,  You're driving chitty,  chitty,  bang,  bang?  What the hell is that?  Imagine she really is.  Yeah.  Fucking,  fucking over Baltimore.  That's terrible.  Avoiding all the fucking traffic. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah.  What,  Charlotte?  The doctors don't send you  to other doctors  to spread the insurance money.  It's more like  he's probably afraid  if,  God forbid,  there was something wrong,  he would get sued by you.  Yes,  litigation.  Well,  it works out,  it works out conveniently  for everybody.  Yeah.  Well,  good.  I'm so glad.  No,  I mean,  I mean,  you got,  I think it works out conveniently.  Like for the insurance.  You're always being sarcastic.  Everyone gets their,  for the doctors.  Oh,  great.  Got it.  Right.  Everyone gets their money, 
[00:19:30]  even the insurance companies.  No,  I believe my pediatrician,  when she said,  let's just make sure.  Yeah.  And then you're in the back of your head  like,  oh fuck,  that's going to be like,  you know,  more time,  money,  stress,  all that shit.  But it works out in your favor.  Yeah,  I mean,  I suppose so,  but really,  like that is not at all  what it goes on in real life  for 99% of people that I know.  Okay.  No,  I know a lot.  I know most of you guys  are on the up and up.  I understand.  Absolutely.  All right,  guys, 
[00:20:00]  I got to run into work,  so I just want to say,  listen,  every morning.  We got doctors listening.  That's nice.  Thank you.  How about the sales fucking department  wakes up?  Yeah,  please.  Enough of the dick pills.  We got doctors listening.  Dick pills would be a fucking relief  at this point.  Right.  All right,  Charlotte,  thank you.  Have a good day.  Yeah.  Because everyone assumes,  like,  the type of show we do,  which I laugh at,  because people have no idea  the type of show we do anymore.  Oh,  it's gutta humor.  They just think we're dumb shock jocks,  but we're talking to a whole bunch  of different fucking people these days. 
[00:20:30]  Of course we are.  Doctors,  lawyers,  and fucking assholes.  Indian shit.  That's pretty much it.  Just fucking assholes.  Yeah.  And a lot of blue collar guys.  Blue.  What else is going on?  You know what?  I didn't even really fucking turn on the TV  or anything yesterday,  so I'm way behind.  What's the big story on the TV?  I have no idea.  I have no idea either.  Still Petraeus,  I think is the big one.  No new info,  right?  It's getting greater and greater.  Now,  all of a sudden,  it says,  this Jill Kelly, 
[00:21:00]  the married mother of,  Dude,  you know what,  dude?  You boom,  you bang Petraeus.  You let this other guy eat your asshole,  dude.  Boom,  what do I know?  I'm in Afghanistan.  But then,  Petraeus,  who was the allied commander of all allied forces,  and Paula Broadwell had an affair.  Right.  His biographer.  I guess he was too flirty with this Jill Kelly,  or she was too flirty.  She's an unpaid liaison in Tampa.  And this,  Paula Broadwell,  who's also married,  by the way, 
[00:21:30]  who is fucking Petraeus,  gets jealous,  and starts firing off anonymous,  angry,  but by the way,  the beauty of this  is the anonymous asshole  was uncovered.  It was uncovered.  Right.  Like,  this dummy sent all these scary emails,  or these emails,  to this Jill,  and she was a little freaked out by it,  so I guess she contacted the FBI,  saying,  I'm getting these threatening emails.  The FBI liaison,  who she contacted,  was told to stay away from the case,  because I think he and her knew each other.  Oh, boy.  And it turns out, 
[00:22:00]  oh, wow,  we have a little thing here.  Oh, my God,  we got a chart.  Where does it go to Molo Station?  Yeah,  this isn't Jim Norton's flowchart.  That's for sure.  But she,  maybe she,  I don't know if this chick was banging Petraeus as well,  but it turns out that the guy,  the FBI guy she turned to,  who said,  I'll put the FBI in the case,  apparently had a relationship,  a friendship relationship with her,  but maybe he had other motives or whatever.  Right.  And now there's emails of her and the general, 
[00:22:30]  who was supposed to take over in Afghanistan,  for all troops,  General Allen,  like these sexually explicit emails.  There's 20,000 pages of communications between her  and this other general.  20,000.  I think I'm summing it up.  It's a lot.  See there.  John,  is his name John Kelly?  John Allen.  I'm sorry,  John Allen,  I apologize.  General John Allen,  right.  Top U.S. commander in Afghanistan.  Paul Allen.  But they were sending dirty emails,  so I guess she's a dirty girl.  Yeah,  dirty girl. 
[00:23:00]  But this fucking cunt.  A general groupie.  Paul Broadwell,  fucking the anonymous,  jealous idiot,  the one who you hate,  who hides behind the keyboard,  brought down two generals.  Wow.  Yeah,  if you're going to do the anonymous emails  to the broad that's fucking Petraeus,  of course,  like,  Petraeus could get things done.  No,  she don't,  no,  no,  she is the broad,  the broad who was fucking Petraeus  was the one sending them.  Right.  That's what I'm saying.  Oh yeah,  she was sending it to someone  who she thought was.  But if it's anonymous,  then of course,  Petraeus is going to like,  he's got connections to go,  all right,  what the fuck is this about? 
[00:23:30]  Well,  he didn't,  this was the FBI.  He was head of the CIA.  The FBI did it.  See,  I'm very confused here.  That's what they're hoping for,  by the way.  Petraeus,  head of the CIA.  Right.  They found out about the affair  of Petraeus by mistake.  So how did she get to the FBI?  Like,  when we get harassing emails,  which we do,  we can't go to the FBI.  Paula was,  how was she able to go to the FBI?  Well,  Jill,  the one who was getting them,  had a lot of connections  because she knew people  in the military.  And she knew this guy  who I think his name  was Fred Humphries  in the FBI. 
[00:24:00]  He was the liaison.  And I think he turned it over  to the FBI.  I believe the FBI said to him,  because you're close to this,  don't go near it.  Okay.  And I think that this guy  actually ratted to somebody  about it because he wasn't  allowed near it.  It's a whole bunch of,  uh,  uh,  fucking,  uh,  sneakiness.  Hold on,  Dan,  leave that up for a second  because,  uh,  there's one more point.  Well,  then you got the twin sister.  How is she involved?  I think she has nothing to do with it.  She's just the twin sister  who has a cooking show  with Jill Kelly.  And what about Chuck? 
[00:24:30]  Where's Chuck?  Chuck Glosterman.  I used to read his books  every once in a while.  Oh,  I don't know.  This flowchart is a day old,  so we might need some updates.  Yeah, yeah, true.  But I heard they mention his name  and I recognize him as an author.  I read a couple of his books  over the years,  a long time ago.  So why is he involved?  I don't know.  I,  I am not sure.  Oh.  The,  uh.  Because he's on the flowchart  we're looking at,  but he's not connected  to anything on the flowchart.  They just have his face  in a little square.  While they were looking  at Jill Kelly's emails,  that's how they uncovered  the affair,  because they traced it back 
[00:25:00]  to Paula Broadwell  and they go,  this is the woman  who's sending it.  She portrays the biographer  and then they went  into her account  and they found an account  that her and Petraeus had.  They were doing the shit  that Al-Qaeda does.  They had an email account,  which is a genius move,  by the way.  Uh,  like say they start  their own email account,  uh,  whatever.  They both have a password to it.  They never send emails.  If I want to communicate with you,  I go in and write an email  and I save it as a draft.  Was it like a Dropbox situation?  In a way, yes.  You go into the same email account later, 
[00:25:30]  read the draft I wrote,  delete it,  and write another draft.  There's never anything sent.  It all looks like Dropbox shit.  It all stays in the draft form.  No emails had been sent.  But I guess they got to her  through that  and then probably figured out  where her computer,  I mean,  however they do it,  for them it's pretty easy.  But it looks like  they got all those communiques,  even though they deleted them,  right?  I don't know.  I'm guessing they do.  They must.  They,  yeah,  they probably have a,  unless there was another way  they got them.  Which just scares the hell out of,  which should scare the hell out  of everybody,  really.  I know,  right?  All of your emails,  no matter what you do,  they're not private. 
[00:26:00]  They're not private.  They're not private.  You send anything,  any kind of communication  over the web?  I've known that for years.  Yeah.  You got to think that  that shit is so traceable.  You really try to believe that.  There is this illusion  of privacy  because it's password-protected.  You don't have privacy?  Yeah.  Of course not.  It's an illusion.  You delete an email  and you assume like,  oh,  well,  that's gone.  I just assume,  but I also know  that no one gives a fuck.  Right.  But every once in a while,  guess what?  People are going to give a fuck.  When the NSA or FBI wants it.  Oh,  boy. 
[00:26:30]  Right.  I mean,  I'm sure there were some ways  that they can't find it,  but they probably had such a lock  on this computer.  And then they started  intercepting them.  I don't know how much  of the old stuff they had  or if they just began intercepting.  Right.  Like,  I don't even know  if they got the old emails.  Wow,  you really know a lot about this.  Yeah,  we were talking about it last night.  The General Kelly  and this General John Allen  and this Jill Kelly,  I guess they had  some really sexy ones  and apparently Jill Kelly  was writing sexy shit too. 
[00:27:00]  Like,  I thought she was just a victim  in this,  but she was a fucking  little dirty one.  Yeah,  dirty girl.  Or she turns me on.  Married mother of three.  All these fucking,  Paula Broadwell hasn't been  heard from.  She's at her brother's house.  Fucking,  this one.  I can't wait  until these marriages  fall apart.  Oh,  yeah,  yeah.  And John Allen,  I'm sorry to interrupt you,  John Allen's NATO appointment  is probably not going to happen.  There's no way  in the middle of this.  No way.  Well,  the other thing,  it says FBI found  classified information  on a personal computer  of Petraeus' mistress.  Oh,  you know what,  dude,  that's maybe where  they got this stuff from. 
[00:27:30]  Maybe they got a lot  of this info  from their personal computers.  Why would there be  classified shit on there?  Oh,  I don't know.  Don't know.  That's all I know.  Classified documents.  Maybe she was using  her relationship with him.  And people who were going,  we were,  of course,  Keith was,  we were arguing.  Paula had top secrets.  It's an article  you got in front of him.  We were arguing last night.  Keith's like,  ah,  who cares?  But I'm like,  that's why these guys  get compromised  because I understand  men cheat,  but it's because  when you're the head  of the CIA,  you have access  to information  that almost nobody 
[00:28:00]  in the country does.  You can't put yourself  in that kind of  compromising position  where it can be used  against you.  Yeah,  and they could actually  get into your shit.  Right.  But how stupid is he  that he didn't realize  they could get into his shit?  Or what a nut  that he had with it.  He didn't know,  that was his judgment.  Yeah.  He didn't know this chick  who he's fucking banging  is so psychotically jealous  she's firing off  angry emails.  Yeah,  not good judgment.  Maybe that's how  they got it though.  Maybe it was from her computer.  I don't know why  I have to say that again.  We heard it the first time.  You got the article?  Oh,  no.  Let me see.  This is, 
[00:28:30]  let me see.  I got this one.  It's Petraeus agrees  to testify on Libya  before a congressional committee,  which of course  you knew he would.  Paula had top secrets.  Yeah.  I have not seen this.  It says the FBI  found a substantial amount  of classified information.  But again,  because things are classified,  you don't know  how top secret they were.  Improperly secured  on the personal computer  of disgraced CIA director  General Petraeus' mistress.  The files were discovered  on a machine  removed from  Paula Broadwell's 
[00:29:00]  Charlotte, North Carolina home.  That's a little brag  like,  hey,  check this out.  Osama bin Laden  is still alive.  Let me check this.  Yeah,  let me send this  to you here.  Or he might have  checked his email  from her computer.  And maybe by that,  that's how it got there.  We got him in the jail.  Don't worry about it.  Don't worry about it.  It says,  investigators also found  documents Broadwell  admitted taking  from secure  government buildings  source.  The network said,  FBI,  this is from ABC, 
[00:29:30]  FBI and military  were going through  the materials this morning  and the prosecutors  were deciding  whether or not  she had to be  charged criminally.  That's why they're  pulling so much stuff  out of her place  because they wanted  to know if they  should charge her.  And the discoveries  prompted the FBI  to step up its probe  of Paula Broadwell  who again anonymously  sent those harassing  emails to Florida  mom,  Jill Kelly.  Now,  Broadwell's top secret  stash was revealed  shortly after  President Obama  told a press conference, 
[00:30:00]  I've seen no evidence  at this point,  from what I've seen  that classified information  was disclosed  in any way that would  have a negative impact  on our national security.  That hadn't been  uncovered.  Our president  doesn't lie.  Obama apparently  doesn't know anything  about anything.  Anytime there's  any type of  dirt,  scandal,  anything,  this motherfucker  just doesn't know.  I don't know,  I was told,  I wasn't told,  I don't know,  this happened,  it didn't happen,  I don't know,  we're still investigating,  I don't know.  I know,  it's almost like, 
[00:30:30]  I can't recall.  Yes.  Reagan and all  the fucking Iran-Contra.  They all do that.  Yeah.  They might not know  on a certain level  the details of the lies.  It's so much easier  to say I don't know.  Of course he's going to  say I don't know.  I believe he did know.  But of course he's going  to say I don't know  because,  you know,  it's way too much  fucking of a hassle  if you do come forward  and say,  this nightmare was going on  as I was trying  to be re-elected.  This web of deceit  is going a little further  than a lot of people 
[00:31:00]  thought when they  scratched the surface.  And,  you know,  we'll see how high  up the ladder is.  Oh,  it's going to stop  with Petraeus  and John Allen.  I guarantee you.  And they'll get certain,  what they'll get out of it  is maybe they'll be  allowed to like keep  whatever,  I don't know what  pensions work  or what would you retire,  but they'll be allowed  to keep certain perks  or,  eh.  You think it's like  a radio bit gone bad  where they sit everyone down?  Oh, yeah.  Let's see.  We've gone through  this so many times.  And then we'll get you 
[00:31:30]  back into the,  yeah,  Who else knew?  Who else knew about this?  Oh, they wanted us  to ride out everyone.  Yeah.  I remember running  out of the fucking  building with my  desktop computer.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  And they were like,  you got to bring that back.  Like, yeah, right.  Sorry, I sold it.  Right.  Remember that?  They told me.  That was NW, right?  Yeah.  What the hell did you have  on there that you needed  to get that out of there?  I didn't want them  just going through my,  yeah, I know.  It was my gaming computer  from the office. 
[00:32:00]  And they're like,  you got to bring that back  because we got to go  through the computer  to check emails  and see who knew  about this.  And I'm like,  yeah, now it's gone.  I sold it.  Like it was this thing  going down.  Yeah.  It was a dumb fucking  bit that went bad.  Dummies.  They went through  our office  with a fine  tooth comb.  Everything.  Remember they completely  destroyed the office?  Yeah.  It's like, hey,  you know,  we did have like  real shit in there  that we kind of wanted.  Yeah.  They pretty much 
[00:32:30]  like when they  search a home,  they searched our office  and they didn't give a fuck  what they left behind.  Ransacked.  There was shit  all over the floor.  They were pretty much  going like this,  pulling things off shelves  and going through.  What the fuck  were they looking for?  I don't know.  Anything for litigation.  Anything to protect them  in a litigation  if they make a decision  to prove that they  were on the right side  or any of that stuff.  This was the NEW prank  Sex with Sand  that went bad  because we've gone  through this,  I don't know,  three or four times now.  Yeah.  And I remember 
[00:33:00]  people that were  still working there  told us that they  locked that office  and no one was allowed  in it or was allowed  to touch it  and it remained like that.  Yeah.  We haven't talked about  this in a while  so I don't remember.  A long time.  A long time  is a very good answer.  A really long time  and then they finally  just took all our shit  and threw it away.  We were never able  to really go back  and get any of our stuff.  Maybe they were  looking for something  which would have  maybe,  because they had to  pay you guys,  maybe they were  looking for something  that would have  enabled them  not to pay you.  Some kind of a  contractual breach 
[00:33:30]  on the computer  like,  you know,  I got to be a kiddie porn  or anything  that they could use  to not,  whatever they were  looking for  to not pay you  and they didn't  find it.  And by the way,  one more thing is  if you think politics  don't play any part  in decision making,  which no one said  that I just had  to segue into this,  the House Intelligence  Committee held  hearings Wednesday  regarding the handling  of the probe  and the timing  of its release.  Senate Intelligence  Committee chairwoman  Diane Feinstein,  Democrat,  California,  echoed the president's  belief that there  were no security  breaches linked 
[00:34:00]  to the liaisons.  She's so far up  his ass.  But there may not  have been.  Is she the one,  the Jewy Jewy?  Yeah.  The Jewy Jew.  And she's really  pounding the gun  control issue right here.  With the curly  blonde hair?  Yeah.  Can you imagine  if that was Bush  or anybody?  Would she have  come to his aid  this quickly  and said,  oh, no security  breach,  that I want  an investigation?  They'd be screaming.  And if it was,  if that was,  if that was Newt Gingrich,  he would not be  backing up Obama  either.  He'd be going,  well,  we want a full,  yeah.  Fucking amazing.  How about we just 
[00:34:30]  figure out what  the fuck happened?  Yeah.  And then the  Benghazi thing  is attached to this  because,  you know,  Petraeus was the  fucking guy in charge  during that whole thing.  Well,  he was too busy  trying to take care  of possibly two  mistresses.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Maybe a little  distracted.  Because even  in this article  they say a friend,  the other woman  that they're not  positive that he  had sex with,  they put friend  in quotations.  Because they don't  know Jill Kelly.  A married friend  they write.  Friend.  They want to say,  you know,  another mistress,  but they can't  officially say that.  She was sending  dirty ones  that apparently 
[00:35:00]  that John Allen  though,  who I like,  I like these  dirty girls.  Love to know  what that says.  Naughty married  Paula,  naughty married  Jill,  firing off  dirty thoughts.  Naughty married  girls just  firing off  LOLs,  hopefully a  vag picture.  He's not  here.  Tee hee hee  hee hee  hee hee  return.  Tee hee hee  giggle.  Yeah.  It's dirty. 
[00:35:30]  It's kind of  hot in a way,  right?  Kind of hot.  I'm fucking  my dick doesn't  butt pump  plump up.  The fuck,  man?  The fuck  was Betraya  doing?  Just shows you  he had an easy  gig.  You think?  Yeah,  that's all  this time.  Man,  I think he  was delegating  responsibility.  That's what  I'm saying.  Yeah.  He had  everything under  control.  He had his  people in  place and  it gave him  a little  time.  It really  is amazing.  Wow.  Just everyone  winds up tripping 
[00:36:00]  over their own  dick.  Everyone.  Everyone.  Well,  if we're doing  politics,  we certainly  can do the  John McCain  story.  John McCain.  I don't know  that one.  John McCain.  John McCain.  A reporter  asked John  McCain if  the Petraeus  leaks are a  bigger threat  to national  security than  Benghazi.  I think it  all fits in  together.  You don't  know what he  did?  No.  All right,  I won't  read the  other part.  It's classic  actually.  I hope he  cupped a fart 
[00:36:30]  and threw it  at the guy.  It was totally  unexpected.  He farted  into a paper  cup and held  it under the  reporter's nose.  We're not  big fans of  the reporter,  are we?  I don't  think so.  But do you  have a problem  with what this  reporter asked?  I think it's a  stupid question.  Reporter asked  John McCain if  the Petraeus leaks  are a bigger  threat to national  security than  Benghazi.  Okay.  Not a bad  question.  Reporters have  certainly asked  worse. 
[00:37:00]  All right.  I think there's a  motive there.  Senator, do  you think  there was  potentially a  greater national  security threat  in apparently  thousands of  pages of  classified documents  ending up on  the personal  computer of  Tampa's social  life and the  head of the  CIA, of a  secret covert  email accounts  involving the  head of the  CIA and the  top general in  Afghanistan, and 
[00:37:30]  the fact that the  FBI agent was  complaining to  step out of the  chain of command  apparently and  went to a  Republican leader  rather than  anybody else?  Do you think  there's a potential  you put all that  together, do you  think that's a  potential greater  national security  president that  you're talking  about?  Well, I say  with great  respect.  That's one of the  dumbest questions  I've ever heard.  Okay?  That's four dead  Americans.  That's four dead  Americans.  Not a socialite.  Not a socialite.  I'm answering your  question.  Okay?  Do you want me to  answer your question? 
[00:38:00]  You want me to  which do you  want?  Okay.  There's four dead  Americans.  The lives of other  Americans were put  in jeopardy.  This is a matter  of four dead  Americans.  I think that the  other issue raised  is very serious,  and I think it  deserves a thorough  and complete  investigation.  But it does not  rise to the level  of an attack on  American consulate  that took four  American lives.  And I'm sorry if I  was...  I think it's  certainly a national 
[00:38:30]  security issue,  but it doesn't  rise to the level  of four dead  Americans.  Pardon me?  Could threaten  more than four  lives?  I think any  security brief  could threaten  more, but the  fact is there  are four dead.  Yeah, go ahead.  Good for him.  And you could tell  that guy kind of  knew his question  was bullshit  because he was  setting it up in a  way by saying,  and when you take  all those things  and put them  together, he didn't  just ask it like  you say, what's  worse, A or B?  He knew he had 
[00:39:00]  to pile it on to  even make the  question sound  right.  Yeah, yes.  Good for McCain.  It's not good she's  got classified shit  on a computer,  obviously.  No, but that's  not the same as  an attack on a  fucking embassy.  Of course.  In Libya.  It's two different  issues going on.  Top secret.  I wonder what it  is, though.  The power of the  pussy.  Things are considered  secret, top secret,  even when they're  kind of just, you  know, silly stuff.  But I think he  couldn't help  himself.  The power of the 
[00:39:30]  pussy is like, he  probably got giddy.  Like, he probably  knew what he could  probably show her  that wouldn't be  much of a big deal.  It could be stuff  because she's the  biographer, right?  Yes.  So he probably gave  her some information  about him that might  be pertinent to the  book and it's  considered classified,  but maybe, you  know, if the normal  Joe read it, he'd be  like, oh, why is this  considered classified?  And then they give  you some weird  reason, you know?  There's an address in  there that we don't  want out. 
[00:40:00]  I don't know.  I'm just speculating  out my ass.  By the way, Jimmy did  a great job of this  whole thing because I'm  very confused, but now  I know a lot more.  Notice how on top of  this I am, the fucking  dirty emails back and  forth and forth.  That one I pour over  every article.  You explain that weird  flow chart that's been  going around.  The one thing that you  might have got wrong.  But it's possible.  According to Matt  Bishop, he says that  they never deleted  the drafts.  Oh, I didn't know.  Okay, you know what?  That was actually told  to me.  I didn't realize that.  Okay, so all the  drafts were still there?  Dummies. 
[00:40:30]  Matt, I trust Matt,  but he might be right.  I would say he's  probably right.  Is he on the phone?  No, he's on the  instant feedback.  You might be right,  Matt.  That was told to me  last night in  conversation, so maybe  that was maybe someone  describing the method  did it wrong.  Wow, that's sloppy to  save the emails.  But then again, you  want to go back and  jerk off to them.  Well, it's not emails  officially, like you're  saying.  Well, the drafts, yeah,  but why not delete them?  It's kind of like the  only way I could  describe it is like a  Dropbox.  When someone sends you  something, you go in  and you sign in.  Oh, all right, that  sounds cool, and then  you could add to it or 
[00:41:00]  whatever.  Maybe it was Dropbox.  Maybe you could do  that with emails.  No, this was a Gmail  account.  This was definitely a  Gmail account, yeah.  Just leave it in drafts,  yeah, without sending  them.  Yeah.  Oh, I see what you're  saying.  Yeah, yeah.  So if you both have the  password to the Gmail  account.  Right, you're just  reading each other's  drafts, and I'm like,  why wouldn't they  delete those drafts?  Oh, okay.  I thought it was  another special service.  Yeah, there's no  trail.  Gotcha.  But they could track  you going and coming  from that email account,  but there's nothing  going and zipping back  and forth.  Yeah.  Thousands of emails. 
[00:41:30]  Oh, I want to know  what...  Paul Abralo, we already  know, is dirty.  The dirty biographer.  But I want to know  what that Jill Kelly  was sending the general.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, my husband's away,  and so are the three  kids.  Here's my cunt, LOL.  I sure could use a  five-star fucking  right about now.  Yeah, he fucks me  like a corporal.  I'd like you to eat  my ass like at least  a colonel.  Yeah, I'd like you  to plow me like I'm  a Taliban mistress.  You got to think  some of those emails  will come out.  Oh, dude, I think  they will. 
[00:42:00]  They have to.  They're on the record.  And Keith Michael,  I guess he tried  to call into the show,  but he's saying  Sal panicked.  Oh, yeah.  He called in,  and he says,  now you got Sal nervous,  but this guy wanted  to say,  but Sal didn't  put him on hold.  For whatever reason,  I'm not saying Sal  was wrong,  because I have no idea.  I could assume it,  though.  Yes.  He retired to save  his pension  and an honorable  discharge.  Yeah.  Okay, yeah,  that's probably  the smart move.  Yeah.  But this other guy's  waiting for his  NATO appointment.  Oh, I don't see  that coming anytime soon. 
[00:42:30]  No.  No.  And she's not  allowed on the base  anymore.  This Chick Jill Kelly  has not been allowed  back on that base.  Oh, no shit.  So by starting,  by complaining,  she brought down  this fucking,  but then again,  by sending the emails.  And there's another part.  It's always something  like that.  Fucking small thing.  I was just about  to go with you.  She contacts  the FBI guy,  I think you said this.  Humphreys,  I believe his name was.  And then the FBI guy  decides to send  the fucking,  um,  topless photo of himself.  Yeah.  But I think that he's 
[00:43:00]  saying that that was  an old photo as a goof  and they might have  known each other prior.  Ah, it's a goof.  I'm assuming they knew  each other and that's  why she contacted him.  But what he said?  It's a goof.  What are you gonna do?  Send a shirtless  picture to a chick?  Like that isn't fucking  putting your toe in the water.  Oh, brother.  Unbelievable.  Yes.  Oh, I love these.  I love these dirty  Tampa girls.  Yeah.  What are you doing?  Oh, I'm just here in Florida 
[00:43:30]  pulling my thong  between my ass cheeks.  What are you doing?  Hubbies away.  Fucking dirty  Tampa girl.  I'll bet you that  fucking Paula Broadwell  would make him fuck her  with the uniform on.  Oh, yeah.  She'd probably leave  the uniform on, Jen.  She'd call him Jen.  She'd hold her head.  Is Florida officially  like the craziest  girl state?  Yes.  Degenerate,  crazy, lunatic,  fucking.  Wasn't that, uh,  remember that astronaut  who?  That crazy astronaut 
[00:44:00]  with the diapers.  That was in Florida.  Yeah, she drove  to Dallas.  She drove two dollars  and be from Florida.  Yeah, she drove  to Dallas in a fucking,  with a hammer  and diapers.  Yeah, to make a doo-doo  in her pants  and then build a house.  Remember that, winner?  Oh, yeah.  I mean, how fast  do you gotta get somewhere  where you can't pull over  and quickly take a doo-doo?  Very, very, um, focused  on her plan  to cave the chick's head  in with a hammer.  Florida is weird.  Yeah, Florida  is just a weird-ass state.  Oh, I love that. 
[00:44:30]  Weird-ass state.  Yeah.  Holy shit.  That was lovely.  Well, we gotta get  to the EROC contest.  Yes, we do.  And I'm so sad  that, uh,  the great story  about Anthony  in the paper, too.  Oh?  Yeah, there's,  I was surprised.  It's a man distraught  over presidential election results  kills himself.  Some guy just killed himself.  There you go.  At least that guy  had some, uh,  some gumption.  He's a mover and a shaker.  What happened there?  Uh, he said, 
[00:45:00]  at least he's not  one of these fake guys.  You hear people go,  you know,  if he's reelect,  I'm leaving the country.  Or, or you do hear  sometimes,  I'll kill myself.  Well, this guy wasn't lying.  Well, of course,  he was in Key West, Florida.  Oh, boy.  Psychotic fucking state.  He said he was distraught  over the presidential election results  and he worried about his business.  Killed himself.  And they said that they found  Henry Hamilton's body.  He was in his bedroom  on November 8th.  Oh, right, Hamilton.  And, uh,  he had a living will  and the hand,  with the handwritten words,  do not revive,  fuck Obama. 
[00:45:30]  Two empty prescription bottles  were found in the dining room.  His partner,  Michael Cossie,  told Key West police  he saw Hamilton  when they watched  the election results together.  According to the police report,  Hamilton was upset  and said,  if Barack is reelected,  I'm not going to be around.  That's probably,  because here's what would probably happen,  and obviously a gay couple,  the one guy was probably saying,  I want to get married.  I hope he wins.  And then he's like,  well, if he wins,  I'm going to kill myself  because I'm not marrying you.  Sure, I like when you put it in my ass  and I like your beard on my back,  but I'm not going to marry you. 
[00:46:00]  We can't, remember?  And then he got elected  and he's like,  oh, fuck,  I'm going to have to marry this guy  and give him half my shit.  Fuck it.  Have some pills.  That's my take.  It's a good take.  Man.  Yeah.  This whole fucking thing  isn't going to get figured out.  The weird thing was,  Broadwell,  they did the biography  and they began fucking  in Addison, Texas,  which is such a weird place  considering I'll be there tonight,  tomorrow,  and Saturday  at the improv.  Tickets available.  When are you going to come to Dallas? 
[00:46:30]  I'm coming,  assholes.  Where are you?  I'm coming,  assholes.  Where are you?  I don't know, Jimmy.  You got the Dallas plans?  Yeah, tonight.  It's not the worst.  Holy shit.  How many fucking times  am I going to get emails  and go somewhere  and the fucking room's half sold?  Fucking, Jimmy,  you got to fucking come down here, man.  You got to come down  and do some shows  and pictures on my way.  You got a lot of,  how many times are you here?  You got a lot of fans  in this blank. 
[00:47:00]  Exactly.  In this blank.  Yeah, it should say  in this room,  meaning his house.  Just because you and your pal  stumbled upon the show  doesn't mean the rest  of the fucking town knows us.  Right.  Can't just go to your town.  We're realistic  where we are in our careers.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  We got the stunt brain calling in.  He knows this shit.  Oh, yeah, he definitely knows.  Oh, he's, uh...  He's with the blaze.  Stunt brain, our ex-producer.  He makes believe he's a moderate,  but he's a right-winger like Anthony. 
[00:47:30]  What's up, stump brain?  Yes, I am a conservative  in most of my beliefs,  but I've got a few sneaky ones  in the social category.  All right, fair enough.  Theblaze.com,  and we all love the stump brain.  I'm just fucking with you.  What's going on, Mikey?  I've been following this Petraeus thing  all over,  and you guys have a lot of it  right dead on.  There's some weird stuff  with Broadwell and Kelly.  As you've talked about Broadwell,  she had security clearance  that just got shut off. 
[00:48:00]  Ah, yeah.  Because she was traveling  with Petraeus,  and she had access to stuff  for his biography,  but they just slammed her  and closed the door  on all her clearances,  so she can't get at  classified stuff anymore.  But she did make a comment  in Denver  at a speech this summer  saying that she knew  we had detainees  that we were questioning.  And so she kind of leaked stuff  that was really confidential.  And the video's on the blaze.  Obviously, you can see that.  And the weird thing  about this Jill Kelly 
[00:48:30]  and her evil twin sister.  Why is her twin sister evil?  Is she nutty or something?  Yeah, she has a twin sister  who's apparently  a little unstable.  And the sister was going  through an acrimonious divorce  and custody battle  for the kids.  and both generals  wrote letters to the judge  trying to say she was...  Oh, man.  Yeah, Petraeus and John Allen  both did, right?  Yeah, so you've got two generals  who allegedly have no relationship 
[00:49:00]  to the sister  stepping in and writing letters  to the judge saying,  oh, no, she's good.  She should get these kids.  Your Honor,  please give the kid  to this nut job  so I can fuck her sister.  Yeah, that's pretty much it.  Wow.  Jill Kelly was an honorary  consulate member  and there's a 911 call  where she claims  or kind of raises  the specter  of diplomatic immunity  should be given to her.  What?  And, yeah,  we've got the 911 call as well. 
[00:49:30]  She had license plates  that say honorary consulate member  and she's kind of like  pretending to be a member  of the diplomatic corps.  Oh, yuck.  So when the press  was tromping around  her house in Tampa  and she lives on Socialite Row,  it's all mansions,  it's gigantic homes,  she called 911  and said,  I think I need  diplomatic immunity here.  So she's a ritzy,  titsy bitch.  Now, what about this?  I've never heard that before.  Yeah, I got that 
[00:50:00]  from a fucking Richard Pryor  in fucking Jojo Dancing  Your Life is Calling.  You're a ritzy,  titsy bitch.  So this,  now this Frederick Humphreys,  was he friends with Jill Kelly  and then she turned to him  before this?  Yeah, that's the story  that the FBI agent  that everybody was  heretofore calling shirtless  was pals with her  and then she wrote to him  saying,  look, I'm getting  these threatening emails  and Broadwell was sending them  from a couple of different locations,  a couple of different email addresses 
[00:50:30]  and the FBI, of course,  can just track them  from the IP address  and they led them all back  to Broadwell  and that's how  the whole thing unfolded  and then the agency  took shirtless off the case  when they discovered  he'd been sending her  pictures of himself  and the Times apparently  exposed the guy's identity.  But it just keeps getting  weirder and weirder.  Guys are horny.  Distracting folks away  from the Benghazi.  Yes.  And now it's all  behind closed doors.  We're going to, 
[00:51:00]  Petraeus is going to testify  tomorrow behind closed doors  in D.C.  and I don't know  how much we'll get out of it.  We have a reporter  inside the hearing,  the pre-hearing meetings  today in D.C.  but it's going to be  kind of hush-hush.  Why behind closed doors  this transparent administration?  Yeah, the most transparent  administration in history.  Oh, sure.  It's going to still take,  I think,  a little more squeezing.  There's some thought  that the old Chicago politics 
[00:51:30]  were used to tell Petraeus,  you're going to hold  the company line  or we're going to uncover this  because when the agency  was vetting Petraeus  for the CIA post,  it's expected  they would have known  if he had an overdue  library book.  Sure.  Unless a mistress or two.  Yeah, but maybe,  when did they vet him  for the CIA thing?  2011,  because he was sworn  in last September.  So was he fucking her  back then?  Yeah, he apparently  broke it off  right after he was sworn in.  So maybe there really 
[00:52:00]  was no connection,  like maybe they just  didn't know,  like maybe he was just  banging her overseas  and there was no way  for them to know.  They should know.  They know everything.  Yeah, you got to think  they know.  When they do backgrounds  on these people,  oh my God.  I think I agree with you on that.  Well, I had one more  question too about this,  this Humphreys, right?  This guy was not allowed  in the briefings or anything,  right?  He was kind of taken off  the case in the very beginning?  Yeah, pulled off once  they realized that he had  that little connection  with Kelly.  Aren't these great girls?  I love girls like this.  Just these rich,  fucking dirty ones  who want to be  with the military guys. 
[00:52:30]  Well, the weird thing is  I was trying to explain it  to my wife who's a soap writer  and she goes,  we never would have gotten  this past the network.  It's too implausible.  Right, it does sound  ridiculous, right?  So the whole thing  is just crazy  and it just keeps  getting crazier.  And by the way,  the little email trick  they were using  with the putting the things  in the draft  on the Gmail account,  they learn that  from Al-Qaeda.  That's what the terrorists  use to transmit their  messages to each other.  So nice to know  we're learning  from the terrorists.  Well, it is a smart move.  I actually heard about it  first in a Don Cheadle movie  where he played 
[00:53:00]  the guy who was  well, he was the star  of the movie.  He was either the  lead FBI guy  or wherever he was  but that's how I heard  about that first  was it a Cheadle movie.  Wow.  Yeah, it was an Al-Qaeda trick.  It's only going to get better  and part of me wishes  we had Harvey Levin  in the Senate hearings  asking all the questions  because I think  he'd ask the questions  we all want.  Ah!  Yes, yes.  Yeah, hang with his cup of coffee  that dumb smile  plastered to his face.  In between sips  from his straw?  Yeah.  His sugary coffee drink? 
[00:53:30]  He doesn't want to get  his white teeth stained.  Right.  That's the model trick.  You're a fan of Harvey Levin?  I'm so disappointed in you.  No, I'm mocking him.  All right, good, good, good.  Thank you.  I got scared for a second there.  No, no, no.  But anyway, we're on it.  We're following it  and it just keeps getting stranger.  It is odd.  I don't know what to expect next.  It is odd.  It's juicy.  Yes, it is juicy.  It is juicy  and I'm enjoying  the accuracy of Jimmy's coverage.  Yes.  I'm fascinated.  But, you know,  the sex is the bait, Jimmy, 
[00:54:00]  to get you in and follow him.  It very much is.  Ben Ghazi, look,  I don't know who this guy is.  I mean, you know,  I've never met Ben  so I can't comment on him.  What is this?  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, boy.  Ew.  When it bombed the first time,  I had to really clarify it  with the name Ben.  Thank you, Mr. Stunty.  Thanks, Mike.  Thanks, boys.  All right, Mikey.  Blaze.com.  Yes, the Blaze.com.  Stunt brain, everyone.  We like to stunt brain.  He knows that political shirt. 
[00:54:30]  Let's eat our food  before it gets cold.  Yeah, then make out.  You want to crown the winner  of the E-Rock Audio  slash Jingle Contest next, finally?  Sure, yeah.  We wanted to do it yesterday.  Then we got so busy  with all those guests.  And they were all  terrific yesterday.  Indeed.  Pendulet was a fucking hoot.  He's terrific, man.  He can't talk about anything.  He's just a great talker.  He's a good guest, yes.  He's really...  You know, he likes to talk,  but it's not, like, too wordy.  He's interesting. 
[00:55:00]  He always knows  exactly where he's going.  You don't have to direct him.  I asked him one question,  and it took 20 minutes to answer.  Probably, like,  seven minutes to answer,  but it was fascinating  all the way to the answer.  Yeah, he's good.  He tells a good story.  He knows how to break shit down.  Spins a good yarn.  I started reading his book, too.  It's really good.  Yeah.  He breaks down  the shaft theme.  Yeah.  Like, who would do that?  That's great.  That's how he opens the book.  He's been bothered  by the shaft theme  and why, like,  they start singing  two minutes into the song, 
[00:55:30]  and then, like,  it's not written properly.  But it held my attention.  Yeah, yeah.  Like, who thinks this shit up?  He's good.  Book's good, man.  It really is.  It tells a good story.  All right.  We'll do the E-Rock thing next  and some other shit.  Sure.  Let's do that.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  We're such faggots. 
[00:56:00]  Not in the way  where we take dicks,  by the way.  Relax, people.  We're talking about  how we like our tea.  That's right.  Lots of cream,  lots of sugar, gentlemen.  Me and Danny  are in agreement  that you don't put 
[00:56:30]  fucking milk in your tea  and Hank goes,  oh, no,  I enjoy milk in my tea.  My mother used to have that.  You always have  half-drunk tea cups  all over the house.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Have some tea with lemon.  A little honey.  I like that  if I have a sore throat.  Oh, I hope you're okay.  But if I'm just  enjoying a cup of tea,  I like it very sweet  and some milky in there.  Buzz off.  We're going to...  More importantly,  we've got a mystery caller.  Okay.  Surprise caller. 
[00:57:00]  I have my theory  as to who it is  and what they want.  I've already told  the boys off air  so they'll confirm  if I'm correct.  You don't know, right?  I honestly do not know,  but I'm guessing.  No, but I have an idea.  I don't know.  It's not going to be pleasant.  I don't know,  but I think I completely know.  All right.  Does that make sense?  Sure.  All right.  Mystery caller.  I'd like to register  a complaint with Opie and Anthony.  Bingo.  I was right.  So was I.  I wish we wrote it down. 
[00:57:30]  I was right.  How do we all know  that you were the mystery caller?  I'd like to register  a complaint with Opie and Anthony.  Yes.  About their third wheel.  Yes, mystery caller.  Here's the problem.  The problem is,  people,  I get a text from this ass  last night about 730.  Then literally,  I'm in the middle of doing something.  45 minutes later,  I get a phone call.  I don't know if you got my text. 
[00:58:00]  If you don't jump right away  and answer this little worm.  And in the middle of it,  he's making some piddly offer  and he's going,  there's not a lot of money,  by the way.  Like every horrible producer  that we hate,  but when it's him,  it's like,  hey, you know,  there's not going to be  a lot of money.  So I'm just going to  just let that slide.  Listen,  you cheap idiot,  there's not a lot of money.  Don't call me.  Now here's why. 
[00:58:30]  By the way,  when they said  there was a mystery caller,  I said it's probably  Colin ridiculing my text.  Your text.  Yes.  That doesn't stop the fact  that you did it.  I'll tell you why I did it.  Your psychic ability  doesn't change the fact  you're an ass.  Now what were you doing at 7?  Here's why I texted you  and here's why.  I was at Creak.  It doesn't matter  what I was doing,  but I was at Creak  and Cheap  before my constitution show.  Now here's why  I called you after a text,  which I never do.  I never give follow-up calls. 
[00:59:00]  Shut up.  Yes, you do.  No, I don't.  I was voted least likely  to give a follow-up call.  I didn't realize that.  And then he  tries to throw Kenny  into the book.  You never got back to Kenny,  but I got back to Kenny  the same day.  Oh, you see?  You idiot.  He hasn't gotten that.  Well, you see that we have,  what we have here  is a failure to communicate.  Oh.  I thought  that for some reason  I knew that your power  was back on.  For some reason,  I'm like,  I wonder if he's having  phone trouble 
[00:59:30]  because I hadn't talked  to you in a few days  and I hadn't seen you.  So I don't know  why I thought that,  but I sent Colin a text,  a very,  a small offer,  but it is literally  all I have to offer.  And I cleared it up  and then I didn't hear  back from him.  So I'm like,  I wanted Kyle  to be the first.  45 minutes.  Oh, that's what he also said.  He goes,  yes.  He goes,  you're the first person  I'm putting this up.  Whoa.  The reason I'm the first person  you're putting it out to  is you don't have the balls  to offer any of your 
[01:00:00]  bigger friends  that piddly offer.  No, no, no.  I have four different  things to offer,  but you were the first one  I wanted to ask.  And I was letting you know  you're the first one  I'm asking,  but I wanted to put out  a couple of other texts,  but I wanted Kyle  to be the first one.  That means Jimmy's got something.  What do you got, man?  He does it like  it's Scott Rudin.  Who's Scott Rudin?  Some big producer.  Oh, we're really out of it.  I don't want to say that  because I've had a thing  that Scott Rudin was there.  I wouldn't have  even known that great reference  myself probably.  I don't know who he is.  We're out of the loop, guys. 
[01:00:30]  Let's face it.  I should have hit Scott Rudin  if we were all in showbiz.  We'd be like,  ha, ha, ha.  I don't want to listen  to Norton's rationalizations.  What I want to say is  the fact is  Dice Clay's in a new  Woody Allen movie.  Anthony doesn't have  20 minutes of Dice  for Woody Allen movie.  We actually did do  a little of that  when we first heard about it.  I can't wait  until it comes out.  Absolutely.  I want to see Dice  and Woody Allen.  He'll be the greatest.  Oh, hell yeah. 
[01:01:00]  I love Dice.  I also would like  to see Dice.  I put it on Twitter,  but I never heard  back from anybody.  Like Norton,  I expect an immediate response.  Put out some thoughts.  Norton are very similar  these ways.  That's why I know  what he's up to  when he's up to something.  He can't fool me.  I have the same mentality  as him.  I'll take that as a yes,  by the way,  in accepting my offer.  Bacon, is it no?  No, I want you to accept it.  What's the offer?  Anything good? 
[01:01:30]  I'll say off air.  No, it's nothing major.  It's something that has it.  You're going to be off air  and you're going to be deflated  by the lack of, yeah.  I would like you  to accept the offer.  But also,  I want you to just laugh  and blow him off.  But all I want  is for it.  I want Anthony  to do Petraeus.  Dice talking about  the Petraeus case.  Andrew, Dice, Petraeus.  Well, maybe there's  a little deal  that can be cut here.  Talking about Petraeus.  What's that?  You want to hear  Anthony do Dice 
[01:02:00]  and Petraeus?  I want a yes  from Colin Quinn.  How about we all  talk this out?  Oh.  No, I don't need  to hear it.  I was just throwing  out my suggestions  on Twitter.  I was hoping  Colin, great idea  to retweet me  and Anthony.  That would be good  because there are  just a couple  of hoes.  A couple  of hoes.  I thought  I'd start  a mild brush fire  and it would have  just ignored me.  What are you doing  today, Carl? 
[01:02:30]  But honestly,  I'm meeting  Jer for breakfast  in a few minutes.  Why don't you bring  him by?  We'll all have a hang.  Yeah, bring him by.  It's about time.  Well, Jer.  Can I tell everyone  where you go  for breakfast  so maybe...  No, it was going  to bug me.  They won't bug you.  No, they won't bug you.  Bug you.  They'll ask you  to hold the camera.  They'll bug me.  Yeah, because you're  going to have to  take a lot of pictures.  There's something  I got to answer 
[01:03:00]  to that time.  He goes,  I mean, I like Colin,  but what's he doing?  Sorry, Colin.  You're one of my faves.  Hey, hey, it's  the mystery caller.  Why are we pulling  back the fourth?  Yeah, that's true.  Yeah, don't treat  the mystery caller  like this.  That's right.  You still...  Go ahead, I'm sorry.  I was going to say,  you still working  shit out at that place  in Long Island City?  By the way,  did anyone ever  in the history of ONA  just stop in the middle  and go,  go ahead, I'm sorry. 
[01:03:30]  No, no.  But Colin did say...  You are the first.  Colin did say that  at the beginning  of his call  that he was a creaking cave.  Oh, is that what he said?  Oh, okay.  I didn't hear that.  I would like to go  down there again  and see Colin.  It was very...  I would love you to.  It's really fun.  It was very fun.  But here's all I have to say.  All jokes aside  about the Jim thing,  you know,  because I'm obviously  and I'm like,  I don't want to do it.  Jim, call my manager.  Bye, guys.  We'll call the manager,  but I just wanted  to put the offer out 
[01:04:00]  to call first.  Of course.  Yeah.  All right, Mr. Colin.  I had a lovely conversation  with Kenny weeks ago  about this project.  No, that's a totally  different thing.  I know.  Okay.  I know.  I threw him under the bus  as if I wasn't calling  anyone back.  No, but that's why  I thought you might not  be getting text messages  because if Kenny contacted you  and for whatever reason  your response got lost,  I know you'd call him  back about that,  so I'm like,  maybe Colin's not...  What the fuck did you get lost?  I spoke to Kenny  on the phone.  Oh, I didn't know that.  Kenny didn't relay that to me.  Angry Colin. 
[01:04:30]  Why are you so angry?  Kenny didn't tell me that.  I'm angry because  look, you're like this.  That's why I figured  it was literally  45 minutes later  he calls and  excuse me,  Jim Norton gets returned  in 45 minutes.  Something must have  ruined your text.  Well, I was just leaving  you a follow-up message.  That's all.  I was anxious.  Follow-up?  Because if we had gone  right to Colin's manager first,  he'd be calling and going,  you know,  will you fucking see me?  You can't fucking talk  to me, you know,  Kenny?  I'm right here.  I'm right here. 
[01:05:00]  You got my fucking number.  So I figured...  That's exactly what  he would have done.  So I figured  I would text you  and let you know  that I was asking you  to do this  and then...  Did you take a course  where you're like,  try the personal touch  with people,  you know?  Yes!  I've been told  that I'm too business-oriented.  They said,  Jim, you know,  sometimes a smile  goes a long way.  Yuckaroo.  Bye, mystery caller.  Enjoy your breakfast  with Mr. Seinfeld.  Yeah, have fun. 
[01:05:30]  I'm going to give a prize  to anybody  that gets this  who the mystery caller was.  Bring Jeremiah.  We'll have a hang.  We'll all have a chew.  All right, guys.  All right.  That's stupid.  All right, stupid.  Notice he doesn't even,  like, answer that, really.  No way.  You think Jerry Seinfeld  hates us  or this type of radio?  He would not want  to be part of these shenanigans.  We'd be cool.  We have Chris Rock  in from time to time.  Doesn't matter. 
[01:06:00]  No?  Jerry is a whole  another breed of animal.  What is he about,  you think?  Porsches  and millions of dollars.  Yeah.  So he doesn't need  this shit?  He's not exactly  the guy from the show,  but he's got enough  of the guy from the show  in him.  I'm sure.  I don't think  he'd like sitting  in this atmosphere.  Speaking of the greats,  Patrice O'Neill.  Yeah.  It's almost been a year.  My God. 
[01:06:30]  Jeepers.  I'm surprised that myself,  I still have not  listened to his voice  in a year.  Really?  Yeah, I kind of want to.  A couple of things.  A couple of things  out there I want  to check out.  That CD that came out  after he passed,  I want to listen to that.  Yeah.  I hear it's great.  And we got more  new material  from Patrice O'Neill.  New 20-minute stand-up  consists of never-before-released  all-new material  recorded on April 17,  2011 at the DC Improv. 
[01:07:00]  Better Than You  was originally considered  for a bonus track  on O'Neill's  Mr. P album,  but was too long  to fit on the same album  that O'Neill had approved  before his death.  He's like Biggie and Tupac  coming out with shit afterwards.  It's crazy.  Yeah.  So it's a CD, basically.  A 20-minute CD  called Better Than You.  And people are saying  it's great.  Very cool.  Release date.  So it was released already?  Yeah.  So how did they get it?  I'm going to guess iTunes.  You can definitely get it  on iTunes. 
[01:07:30]  Yeah, I think it's iTunes.  iTunes and Amazon, I believe.  Well, it says,  reminder that Mr. P is available  on iTunes and Amazon.  So this material,  all right, just search  Patrice O'Neill  and look for Better Than You.  5.99.  And I believe the money  going to a good place, right?  Yes, as far as I know.  Yes, I think his mother  and Vaughn.  And Vaughn.  I believe so.  Who's doing all right.  I hope so.  She wants to come in.  Good.  I said, yeah, hell yeah.  Maybe we'll get her in next week. 
[01:08:00]  Yeah, before the holiday.  Before the holiday.  So there you go.  Patrice O'Neill.  We fucking missed this guy.  Big fucking time, man.  Oh, yeah.  It's been almost a year.  That's unbelievable.  That's a quick year.  I didn't realize  it was that late in the month,  the 29th.  It was the 29th?  Because I was trying  to figure that out.  I didn't realize  it was after Thanksgiving.  Walked around like zombies  for a while there, huh?  Yeah.  All right.  Better Than You,  Patrice O'Neill  on iTunes and Amazon.  There you go.  And we'll put this  on the Facebook page there, E-Rock.  Yes.  That'd be good. 
[01:08:30]  You want to go to E-Rock now?  Oh, boy.  E-Rock.  So we had good intentions yesterday.  We went through  all the finalists  of the side contest  that's going on now.  You had good intentions.  Yes.  We had good intentions.  We had the O&A jingle contest  that is still happening.  And one of these tracks  that we play today  could win both contests.  But we discovered  that so many people  were focusing on E-Rock  with the O&A audio contest  that we made a side prize  of $500  courtesy of  IHateStevenSinger.com?  $500 gift card. 
[01:09:00]  Gift card to  IHateStevenSinger.com?  Yes.  Okay.  Very good.  So we're going to do  the side winner now  for the E-Rock jingle contest.  Votes have been tallied.  Yes.  Mystery ballots.  Yes.  And we got the top five.  These are all the ones  that received votes.  Which is good news for us  because that means we get to hear  Oh, hear these one more time.  And then how do we figure out  how to put them into our show?  Well, anytime E-Rock  does something stupid.  I mean, we can throw 
[01:09:30]  some of the more popular ones  in your replays.  Yeah, because these things  should not go away  anytime soon.  Yeah, and you know,  like you guys mentioned yesterday,  it is the holiday season approaching  and we do have  one of the songs  is a take on  Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.  Very holiday oriented.  Yeah.  So we can make sure  that our lovely board op  Eric Nagel  inserts that  quite frequently.  Well, that's not happening.  Well, he has a little control  in there.  He'll be reprimanded.  So in fifth place 
[01:10:00]  in the E-Rock  jingle slash audio contest,  I thought this should have been  a lot higher.  I'll be honest with you.  Look, they're all winners.  I thought this had  a real good chance of winning.  This is number three?  This is number five.  No, you're going five.  Okay, they are.  It was a very hard choice, man.  Very hard choice.  Right.  Zeps, I'm sorry.  Fifth place for you, pal.  Cake and pie  and chocolate and sweets.  That is what  E-Rock likes to eat.  All for himself.  He ain't sharing a bit. 
[01:10:30]  That's why he has tits.  He's a fat piece of shit.  That only came in fifth, huh?  I'm amazed by that.  That's how good  this contest became.  But there were so few votes  cast, though.  Votes had been sent.  That, you know,  one vote could make  a big difference.  Well, E-Rock got two votes,  and we might discuss that  at the end of this.  That's fair.  One for every 200 pounds.  I didn't mean that at all.  Because there's some logic there  that people hit me up with.  That, of course,  E-Rock's going to vote for  one that makes him 
[01:11:00]  maybe look better than others.  I'll tell you what.  You take out Eric's two votes,  it was a three-way tie.  Really?  Are there any other  money laying around?  Just thinking.  We might.  All right.  Fourth place in the  E-Rock Jingle Slash Audio Contest,  Sean F. with this beauty.  Please allow me  to introduce myself.  I'm a man of size and weight.  Worked in radio 
[01:11:30]  for a long, long time,  but my skills are far from great.  Write fan fiction  and I hate my job  because they make fun of my shape.  Had to stay home after Sandy left  because a branch blocked my escape.  I'm an asshole.  Won't you guess my name? 
[01:12:00]  Oh, yeah.  I've been known as X-Fago.  And I don't watch sports at all.  I bring nothing to the table.  I love garlic, butter, salt.  So if you see me,  show some sympathy  because I don't count calories.  I shouted out  who broke the toilet seat  when all the while 
[01:12:30]  I knew it was me.  I'm an asshole.  Won't you guess my name?  That's a good one.  Very good, Sean F.  Fun little ditty.  We're going to put a lot of these  on the Facebook page?  Maybe the top five?  Yeah, we'll throw them up on SoundCloud.  And then we'll link it  to our Facebook page?  Okay.  And to the guys  that we're talking about now,  if you have a Twitter account,  fucking give us your Twitter  so you get a little, you know...  Yeah, we can do that.  A little promotion for your Twitter. 
[01:13:00]  We could give you tweets and whatnot.  Because these names mean nothing.  They mean something to you  and maybe your family,  but, you know,  maybe you get something out of it  by getting some Twitter followers.  Who's next?  I don't know.  Edgar.  Tied for second is what we're up to.  Tied for second  in the E-Rock Jingle slash Audio Contest.  Here's one that tied for second.  Josh Howell.  Yes.  Tied for second.  I'm bummed.  I like this one.  Oh, this is a good one. 
[01:13:30]  I vote for this one.  You know OPN.  Anthony and little Jimmy Norton.  Travis, Sal and Danny.  Roland, Troy and Sammy.  But do you recall  the most morbidly obvious one of all?  E-Rock the shit, dick, fat fuck.  He's a lazy piece of shit.  And if you ever saw him, 
[01:14:00]  you'd know him by his huge bitch tits.  All of the other assholes  laugh and call him piggy boy.  They never let poor E-Rock  have his hoagies and his shitty toys.  It's a great one.  Yeah. 
[01:14:30]  I quickly checked my Twitter.  A lot of people are fucking pissed.  They're saying the fifth and the fourth place were the best ones.  Wow.  Which leads us to something we might discuss in a minute here.  Tied for second with the one you just heard  was Ron Roof with this.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Jam.  Jam.  Big jam tits. 
[01:15:00]  Jelly.  Big jelly tits.  Tits.  Tits.  Big jam tits.  Big jam tits.  Big jelly tits.  Tits, tits, tits, tits, tits.  Big jam tits.  Big jelly tits.  Tits, tits, tits, tits.  What now?  What now? 
[01:15:30]  Tied for second.  Wow.  I wouldn't put that tied for second,  to tell you the truth.  No.  No.  I like the Christmassy one,  but that one I don't think  comes up to the standard of the Christmassy one.  Well, we got the winner.  No, I didn't realize.  Oh, I didn't realize.  Boo.  Spoo.  Boo.  I'm very spooky.  Yes. 
[01:16:00]  Going to haunt you.  You're going to wake up  in the middle of the night  with your penis being tickled.  Boo.  Oh, Steve.  Yes, you're going to find  thick Lebanese fingers  in your bottom.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  I saw someone  on the street last night  with the worst.  So what?  So did I.  With the worst flame jacket.  Oh, really?  And I just thought of Steve.  Thought of Steve, yes.  He would have loved that jacket. 
[01:16:30]  Yes, I would have.  He probably owned it.  Just a jacket suspended  walking down a hallway.  Boo.  Yes.  Flame jacket.  Fire shoes.  Yes.  There's been a haunting.  There's fire in my hallway  and then it disappears.  And two dangling earrings.  Looks like Guy Fieri,  but gayer.  Yes.  Boo.  I get it.  I'm gay. 
[01:17:00]  So we're up to the winner  of the E-Rock  jingle slash audio contest.  I can't believe  none of those won.  Huh?  I can't believe  none of the other ones  that we just played won.  Well, there's a theory  going around.  Yeah.  There's a theory  going around with the staff.  Now, should we...  Well, here's the theory.  E-Rock got two votes.  We didn't really calculate  what that could mean.  Right.  Well, what it meant was  E-Rock was going to pick one  that made him look good.  Yeah, we didn't... 
[01:17:30]  Or look better  than some of the ones  that are really harsh.  There was one specific one  that made E-Rock look cooler  and I don't think  any of us remembered  that if he had two votes,  he could just vote  for the one that makes  him look cooler.  Well, in the end,  his two votes  put him over the top.  Put the contest over the top.  Put this guy over the top.  So the winner  of the E-Rock jingle  slash audio contest  is George Huckus  with this.  Feet up on the floor  like I run the show.  Hokey in my mouth.  Hokey in my mouth.  E-Rock on me, nigga. 
[01:18:00]  E-Rock.  E-Rock on me, nigga.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  Pour in the sea  bikini girls  on the screen.  Coke floats in my cup.  Coke floats in my cup.  So there you go.  George Huckus  wins the $500 gift card  courtesy of  IHateStevenSinger.com.  Wonderful.  I voted for that one.  You did, Jimmy.  And I'll tell you why.  I didn't know 100%  because I love the reindeer one.  The reason I voted  for that one,  and it was hard.  I think everybody,  by the time we had 
[01:18:30]  gotten to the contest,  we've heard it so many times.  But there was just  something about  the Coke floats in my cup.  It was just such a funny  thing to say.  Hoagies in my mouth.  Like, what a weird,  original thing to write.  And even though  he was calling him  a fatso,  E-Rock army nigga,  like, what a,  just a very original.  It was too good  too fast,  and the guy should have  waited to hear  some real duds.  Right, right.  That's what I said.  That's how a lot of  this shit works out.  You need that wiggle room.  Coke floats in my cup.  I like the second time 
[01:19:00]  he repeats that,  because he goes,  E-Rock army nigga.  Yeah, he just  squeezes it out.  Yeah.  That's a fucking  funny one, man.  This is a funny one.  But they were all funny,  but that's why  I like that one the most.  That is a good one.  It didn't go after  E-Rock's obvious  piggishness as much,  like his fat tits  or his side fat,  no disrespect.  Well, and that's why  we feel there's a theory  going around that  that's why he voted  for that guy.  He voted for it twice,  yeah.  His two votes  put George over the top,  to be honest with you.  Yeah, I'm not sure  if it was a fair 
[01:19:30]  competition when it gets,  I don't think E-Rock  voted for that  because it was the best one.  He's not going to vote  for the really harsh one.  No.  Exactly.  He voted for one  that's kind of cool.  E-Rock, comment?  No comment.  I got the vote  for what I wanted  and that's what I did.  Ooh.  Well.  Whoa.  Well, we decided  that maybe,  do we have more money  laying around?  I think if you want  to give away another 500.  Another 500?  I think we can do that.  Because we wanted  to see what the contest  would look like  if we took E-Rock's votes  out of it.  Yeah, because  and it's different.  George Huckus 
[01:20:00]  would not have won  if E-Rock wasn't allowed  to vote.  George Huckus  was really good.  Don't get me wrong,  George Huckus,  that was amazing.  It was really good.  Right.  But I also think  that even though  that was early,  taking that aside,  there were ones  that at least  were funnier than his.  Mm-hmm.  Like there were ones  that I laughed harder at  the first time  I heard theirs  than I did the first time  I heard his.  Yeah, probably.  Like I laughed harder  I think at the reindeer one  or another one  but I just like this one  the best as far as  being original  and I enjoyed it.  I loved Zepp's. 
[01:20:30]  I did too.  But then I let him down  in the end  and the reindeer one  influenced me  at the last minute.  I voted for reindeer.  What did you vote for?  I voted for reindeer, yeah.  And Jimmy voted for  army nigga.  I'm making a movie  called Reindeer Games.  Reindeer Games.  What?  Just already.  I'm spelling it  with a Z at the end.  That's totally different.  And spelling rain,  R-A-I-N.  That's fine.  And deer, D-E-A-R.  Right.  So do you guys want to do  a side-side contest quickly?  Yes, throw them  on the table, boys. 
[01:21:00]  If we have another $500  or a $500 gift card  from IHateStevenSinger.com  why don't we take  E-Rock's vote out  just to see how  it would have been.  It's a good idea.  All right.  And you do have  that tallied?  Yeah.  Sure.  Can we do the runner-up  to the side-side contest?  That's just an excuse  to play...  The runner-up  to the side-side contest?  Well, this is good  because now we're  weeding out the one  that was kind of cool  and we can just get back  to replaying  the horribly insulting ones.  The really horrible ones.  You like this one better? 
[01:21:30]  That E-Rock  didn't even acknowledge.  Yeah.  E-Rock didn't even hear those.  Did you have the track list?  Which one did you vote for, Sam?  I voted for Sympathy.  Oh, okay.  I loved Sympathy.  I do love Sympathy.  You know why?  Yeah, because I thought  it was just  when he said  I'm an asshole...  I'm an asshole.  He just fucking sells it.  I'm an asshole!  And it's not even like  you're making fun  of the easy stuff.  Like, you're not doing  the fat thing  or the lazy thing  or whatever.  He's just an asshole.  You're calling him  an asshole.  Plain, simple, easy.  Did you like that one,  E-Rock?  Sure. 
[01:22:00]  Well, how about this?  Answer this question.  Which was your second...  your runner-up?  You won't like my runner-up,  the second one, anyway.  It was the In Bloom one.  Wow!  Didn't even make  the top five.  No.  That was by Sean F2.  And my third  was Dinosaur.  And that didn't make it.  I like Dinosaur.  I don't know why  that fucking fell  through the cracks.  Yeah, it was good.  And it was accurate  because dinosaurs  were so big.  You know,  that's the one thing  to keep in mind  historically,  how giant dinosaurs were.  Oh, giant. 
[01:22:30]  The one that was  in my head  all day yesterday  was...  it didn't even place.  It was the guy  who goes,  who is the...  Oh, yeah.  He's just singing  without any music.  Fuck it.  Let's play it.  Which one was it?  No music.  That Dinosaur song  was in my head  all night,  but the original.  Well, you know what?  E-Rock's runner...  No, no, no, no.  Not that one.  I'm playing...  I'm playing Matt Lewis.  Fuck it.  What do you think of that?  This was E-Rock's  runner-up.  And it didn't...  It didn't make  the top five. 
[01:23:00]  Coach Roads in my cup.  E-Rock's the size  of a dinosaur,  dinosaur.  He eats everything.  Why do you think  he's fat?  E-Rock's the size  of a dinosaur,  dinosaur.  He eats everything.  His belly's not flat.  His belly's not flat.  He stops and eats some food. 
[01:23:30]  He's always in the mood.  He stops and stuffs some food  while he's found.  He stops and eats some food  and then he takes a snooze.  He stops and eats some food.  Then he sleeps at the board.  E-Rock's the size  of a dinosaur,  dinosaur.  He eats everything. 
[01:24:00]  Why do you think  he's fat?  E-Rock's the size  of a dinosaur,  dinosaur.  He eats everything.  His belly's not flat.  His belly's not flat.  That one should have got more respect.  You're right.  That should have.  That was hilarious.  That's a good one.  That was your second place, Eric?  No, that was his third place.  Oh.  What was your favorite lyric in it?  Go to hell, Sam.  Well, I just want to know. 
[01:24:30]  That doesn't line with anything.  I don't know why.  That's a fucking play along with this shit.  Why is he so mad?  Go to hell, Sam was not in that song.  No.  I didn't hear it once.  I don't know what the one word is.  What does he say after he goes,  then he eats some food,  because there's one...  He's always in the mood?  No, no.  Not snooze.  There's another line.  And he falls asleep at the board?  Before that.  He always eats some food,  and then...  He stops to eat some food.  He's always in the mood.  He stops to eat some food.  He says it again.  When he's in the mood, 
[01:25:00]  he stops to eat some food all the time.  I think I know what Jimmy's talking about.  Yeah, I know the line tickets.  I don't know what it is.  Are we going to have to listen to it?  There's one line I can't get.  It's the one word at the end of a line, right?  Yes.  Is it early in the song?  No.  It's about halfway through.  Halfway through.  Oh, E-Roc, sorry.  It's the first one that goes,  he stops to eat some food.  Because he's in the mood.  It's for science. 
[01:25:30]  E-Roc, do you like this?  Yeah, we're here.  E-Roc's the size of a dinosaur.  Dinosaur.  He eats everything.  Why do you think he's fat?  Not this one.  E-Roc's the size of a dinosaur.  Dinosaur.  He eats everything.  His belly's not flat.  His belly's not flat.  He stops and eats some food.  He's always in the mood.  He stops and stuffs some food. 
[01:26:00]  All he's found.  He stops and eats some food.  What is that?  What?  Oh, he's foul?  He stops and stuffs some food.  Blah, blah, blah.  It sounds like, oh, he's foul.  What do you think he's saying, E-Roc?  Oh, he's foul.  I don't know.  Weird.  Well, this episode of Misheard Lyrics.  All he's found.  Maybe all.  He stops and eats some food.  All he's found.  He eats some food.  He's always in the mood.  He stops and stuffs some food. 
[01:26:30]  All he's found.  He stops and eats some food.  And then he...  Although he's full?  No, all he's...  All he's...  Maybe all he's found.  It might be all he's found.  The consensus is all he's found.  He stops and eats some food.  All he's found.  He eats all the food.  Oh, gotcha, gotcha.  And then he goes and sleeps next to the board?  Right.  Yeah, you see, the problem is the lyric happens behind the Stemmons freeway sign,  and you can't see exactly what it is.  Oh, man, yes. 
[01:27:00]  And by the time it comes out, you know, Kennedy's on the other side holding a hoagie to his head.  Jesus.  Travis's bum, that one wasn't...  That's a great...  We played yesterday.  It was just in my head all day.  Which one was it?  I think it's track 28.  It's the last one.  Thomas Hamilton.  I think so, yeah.  Track 28, just to bring everybody on board.  Yeah.  Is this a disc of all the entries or...  Only the E-Rock entries.  On track 28.  There's 33 of them.  Okay.  I think we played all 33 the other day, too.  It's like a triple album. 
[01:27:30]  Yeah.  There's 33 E-Rock entries.  It's supposed to be the O&A audio contest.  He's famous.  But Travis is saying this should have got a little more respect.  It was in my head all day.  No.  Oh, that's not it.  That's not it.  But that's a great one, too.  That's not it.  Well, as you try to find it, I'll just play this out.  Fuck it.  E-Rock's a fat pig.  Isn't that amazing?  Because E-Rock's just kind of chubby. 
[01:28:00]  I know.  E-Rock's a fat pig.  E-Rock's a fat pig.  The opening Anthony show.  With Jim Norton.  And a fat farm animal.  You'd think E-Rock was, like, fucking really fat with the songs that came out.  That's why this is a great bit.  Because they finally see him, and they go, what the fuck?  It's going to make him look, like, way skinny, though.  Yeah.  Because people are going to be expecting.  Yeah, look at it that way.  E-Rock. 
[01:28:30]  E-Rock.  E-Rock from Lost.  When they see him live, they think he's going to be just some really fat, fat pig.  Are they still adding pictures to FatERock.com?  I haven't visited in so long.  This is all new to me.  Oh, my God.  Do you got it?  No, I mean, it's probably between three that are on there, and I don't know if I listen  to all three.  You know, it's tough.  I don't know all the titles.  It might be an untitled one.  It might be number 15.  I don't know.  Number 15.  Well, let's see.  I mean, these all go away after today, for the most part. 
[01:29:00]  No.  No?  Nope.  There's no music to it.  31.  But you know it if you heard it?  Oh, yeah.  I'll know it the second I hear it.  Oh, and it's I know the one.  All right.  I'm sorry, E-Rock.  Growing up in Florida.  No.  He rode a boat to school.  Oh.  33.  That one was terrible.  33.  This is the last one.  33.  He rode a boat to school.  He rode a boat to school.  Kind of funny.  They're all good.  The dinosaur one, I kind of wish I had voted for.  That's a good one. 
[01:29:30]  No.  I would have to go in the back.  Poor E-Rock.  Some of these are really insulting.  Yeah.  They really are.  Wait, how about we try this one?  I want to eat.  No.  No.  That's not it.  How about this one?  I like just hearing the clips.  It's actually funny.  No.  No.  It's music.  Well, how does it go?  You know, Anthony knows exactly the one.  I know exactly the one.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, is there a word in there?  Nope.  Probably fashion.  He rode a dinosaur.  No. 
[01:30:00]  What did that guy say?  We all did enjoy that.  Oh, no.  We got to replay this one.  That's how he says.  Dinosaur.  E-Rock is a dinosaur.  E-Rock is a dinosaur.  Marching.  Marching.  E-Rock is a dinosaur.  What?  Dinosaur.  How do you get so fat?  What?  E-Rock is a dinosaur.  Ha ha.  Dinosaur.  Marching.  Wake up, little piggy boy.  And fucking take us out. 
[01:30:30]  You know what just made me laugh while I was listening to that?  Yeah.  All these songs are about a human being, and he's literally sitting in the next room listening  to everything.  And this is the third day of this.  Are you saying it's overkill?  How dare you?  How dare you?  He's a person, and he's in there.  E-Rock is a dinosaur.  Marching.  Marching.  Hey.  E-Rock is a dinosaur.  Is it the bull police? 
[01:31:00]  That's fucking my favorite word in the contest is dinosaur.  Dinosaur.  Marching.  Is it this one?  Nope.  No.  Is it this one?  E-Rock.  No.  I want that dinosaur.  It's not a song.  It's not this one.  Dinosaur.  Before we move on, we were talking about.  No.  Nope.  Come on, man.  Now we need to know.  No.  I'm sorry.  I should have found it.  Nope.  E-Rock is a dinosaur.  I love the bad audio quality, Joe. 
[01:31:30]  Oh, it's terrible.  You fucking recorded it next to a fan.  Dinosaur with a Z.  He's the best, that guy.  Dinosaur.  Marching.  Marching.  E-Rock is a dino.  Oh, yeah.  What do you think is fun?  Nope.  God, come on.  Thank you.  We've pretty much done all of them.  You want to take it from the top?  Nope.  I'm going to find this fucker. 
[01:32:00]  Nope.  All right, come on.  Is this it?  He's the boy that loves you.  Oh, this is the one?  Okay.  That's the one.  Travis wishes this got a little more attention.  What track number is this?  We didn't even make the finals when we went through the finals.  I got to point him out every day.  Sorry.  Sorry, audience.  He can't be nicer, too.  I know.  He's a great guy.  Until he's fucking a two. 
[01:32:30]  I know who we're talking about.  Yeah, exactly.  That guy fucked the dinosaur.  She got him fired.  Fired.  I figured it out.  Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.  He's going by the fucking radios.  Oh, shit.  Oh, that's right.  Oh, no.  He went right by the radios.  Are they?  Oh.  No, we got a guy that likes listening to our show right down the hall. 
[01:33:00]  He can't possibly think we're talking to him.  He puts it on really loud.  He can't possibly think we're talking to him.  That would just be a paranoid thing to be.  Yeah.  Oh, they're talking about me.  Especially since he just walked by the radio.  We're saying he just walked by the radio.  That was very covert.  Is he still there?  Is he still standing by the radio?  No, he didn't know before.  He knows now.  Oh, man.  What are you going to fucking talk about?  He's in the coffee room. 
[01:33:30]  Oh, the dinosaurs.  A lot of these should have got more attention.  That's the best one.  We might have to go through all of them again.  Make sure these guys get their proper attention.  That's why we came to contests.  Make sure we didn't leave a good one out.  No, I think you've got to put top five on our Facebook page and maybe a couple honorable mentions.  That dinosaur has to go.  I love that one.  And now this one that I really do like Travis's head.  I don't know this one.  Yeah, this one got kind of thrown away early on in the contest.  But Travis is like, no, man. 
[01:34:00]  You've got to bring this one back for a little attention.  He doesn't get anything.  What's his name, by the way?  I don't know.  Use your Twitter names, man.  At least you get some promotion out of it.  Alan Casper.  Who is the boy that loves hoagies and bacon?  Who never has it?  Every scale he owns is breakin'.  It must be the one and only Iraq.  Pretends to work while looking at bikinis. 
[01:34:30]  Masturbates with bacon's real smart teeth.  Cold old seed wrecked him by his weenies.  It must be the one and only Iraq.  I think I understand the appeal.  It reminds me very much now of your puts the lotion in the eye.  I don't know if it's word it's told.  That silence the musical thing.  I just love how it all starts out as a mystery. 
[01:35:00]  Who is the boy who loves hoagies and bacon?  It must be the one and only Iraq.  Wait, what part?  Right in the beginning?  Who is the boy that loves hoagies and bacon?  It's still a mystery.  It's still a mystery at that point.  Hoagies, bacon.  Whoever has it.  Every scale he owns is breakin'.  Every scale he owns is breakin'.  It must be the one and only Iraq.  Oh, where'd you get the answer? 
[01:35:30]  Which Iraq does he mean?  Does he mean the Iraq who's a dinosaur?  Dinosaur, march you.  Can we one more on that one, please?  One more time.  It's all I want.  A dinosaur.  When do you think he's fine?  Why do you think he's fine?  I like the way this guy talks.  All I want to do is listen to this man sing.  I like the way you talk.  I like the way I talk.  I don't even know where that one is anymore.  Why is that even a picture?  I want to eat.  Nope.  Now I'm going to do this again.  A dinosaur.  I don't know where it is.  Oh, come on. 
[01:36:00]  You've got to find it.  It's in there.  Iraq is a dinosaur.  It might be this one.  Oh.  Come on.  There you go.  Iraq is a dinosaur.  Marching, marching.  Iraq is a dinosaur.  How did he get so fat?  So fat.  Iraq is a dinosaur.  Marching, marching.  Wake up little piggy boy and fucking take us out. 
[01:36:30]  I love that he goes fat.  I like how he lands on his T.  What do you think he's fat?  It actually came to us on a wax cylinder.  We had a...  Yeah, that's what it sounds like.  Mary had a little lamb and fleets was white as snow.  I noticed that we never replayed these in the contest.  Which ones?  The top nine on the list.  Oh, yeah.  We only grabbed a couple for the finals.  Well, those had already...  But that was yesterday, and there's new people.  No, no.  We didn't play those.  At all?  Well, they got one airing. 
[01:37:00]  That's it?  I mean, if you want to replay them.  I just want to make sure there's no nuggets in there.  I want to make sure everyone gets their proper attention.  Look, they're all good.  The show's got to be fair, if nothing else.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  We know he rocks fat.  He has more chins than Chinatown.  He likes to look at bikini pics while he's at work.  He should die in a hole.  But he would not fit because he's so fat. 
[01:37:30]  We all know.  You rock on me, nigga.  I know.  Is that the same guy?  No.  You couldn't even use a synonym for fat.  What happened was, I don't even think these ever aired.  I think what you did was you gave me some of the better ones and said, look, they're  really awful.  I don't think we ever played that one.  That was not awful.  It can't fit in the hole.  These are the awful ones.  I got a couple awful ones. 
[01:38:00]  And then we're going to give another side prize out.  And then we're going to finally be done with this.  I don't like the look of it.  I don't like the look of it.  You heard this one.  You rock is a fat soul.  You rock is a fat soul.  You rock is a fat soul.  That's so.  You rock is a fat soul.  All right.  Boopa, loopa, doompadyo.  XM Sirius Radio.  Boopa, loopa, doompadyo.  This one had a great line.  Mornings with Opie and Anthony.  You rock is a fat soul. 
[01:38:30]  You rock is a fat soul.  You rock is a fat soul.  What do you get between six and ten?  Something before Sam's shit show begins.  But it's repulsed and revolting and wrong.  Jamie has different voices all day long.  Yeah.  You rock is a fat soul.  You rock is a fat soul.  Hang on.  That's great.  You rock is a fat soul.  Boopa, loopa, doompadyo.  You rock looks like honey boo boo. 
[01:39:00]  Have a nice day.  Opie and Anthony are here to stay.  It's the only redeeming part of that song.  I liked it a lot, actually.  I can't look at it.  Is he laughing?  Let me check.  Are you laughing?  Are you laughing?  No.  No, he's not.  That stinks.  Did you get the honey boo?  I thought the group was one today.  Yeah.  I know we all have our issues.  But I thought we all were coming together today.  You rock doesn't look like honey boo boo in the face.  No, not at all.  Boo in the face.  Just in the tits you're talking. 
[01:39:30]  Oh, Danny.  He's had so many years.  He could have fucked everybody over by just cut down on the eating, work out.  He gets all fucking ripped.  Ripped.  And he's just like, fuck you guys.  Well, that's the beauty of it.  Fuck you guys.  We don't give a fuck in the end.  He doesn't give a fuck, you don't think?  No, we don't give a fuck.  I couldn't buy a gym membership or some Legos.  Oh, right, right.  Here's another one that was deemed a bad one that we didn't really play.  Maybe played once.  Some of these I don't think we ever played.  E-Rock is fat. 
[01:40:00]  E-Rock is fat.  So fucking fat.  So fucking fat.  I like this.  Hey, E-Rock, if you're awake, take us to break.  Take us to break. 
[01:40:30]  Now he's just on his phone.  A little barbershop.  That's pretty good.  Now E-Rock's just on his phone.  Fucking Raghav.  Fucking barbershop Raghav.  Who's he talking to?  I don't know.  Do you want to ask him?  E-Rock.  Price Human Resources.  Why is he qualified to call them?  Who should he be calling?  Bovine Resources.  Oh, poor Eric.  Oh, wow.  Jurassic Resources.  Oh, my God.  What are you doing? 
[01:41:00]  Yeah.  That ship couldn't figure it out.  E-Rock's fat.  He weighs a million pounds.  And he keeps pocket money so he can buy more treats.  Opie and Anthony, motherfucker.  A million pounds.  Do you really weigh a million pounds?  E-Rock comment.  Million pounds.  I'll take that as a no.  I was howling, and everyone was howling. 
[01:41:30]  E-Rock, were you howling?  E-Rock, were you howling?  E-Rock, were you howling?  Fucking howling.  E-Rock, were you howling?  E-Rock, were you howling?  I was howling, and everyone was howling.  E-Rock, were you howling?  E-Rock, were you howling?  E-Rock, were you howling?  Fucking howling.  E-Rock, were you howling?  E-Rock, were you howling?  I was howling.  I was howling, fucking howling. 
[01:42:00]  What the fuck? That makes fun of me.  What the fuck?  I got a tree on my house.  It's not very funny these days, is it?  I think we know where E-Rock's two votes would have gone if you had played that one.  Oh, yeah.  That's a good one.  So I checked my Twitter, and people are very pissed off.  Everyone's going to have their own winner.  They really believed that either Zepp's or the Reindeer Song should have won.  Interesting you say that. 
[01:42:30]  I'm just saying, maybe next time we'll have the listeners vote.  Sometimes things are put to a vote, sometimes somebody wins, and sometimes people aren't happy with the results.  But the theory is E-Rock voted for the one that made him look all right, instead of the really, really bad one.  That definitely happened.  Steven Singer said, fuck it, I'll give away another $500 gift card.  So what we're going to do, just to finally wrap this entire thing up, we're taking E-Rock's votes away.  E-Rock Army nigga won.  He won his $500 gift certificate.  Right, he's getting his money. 
[01:43:00]  But now we're just taking E-Rock's votes away to see how it would have been.  And this will be the moral victor.  This will be the moral victor.  So this is the side-side contest now.  So who's the runner-up in the side-side contest?  Do you want me to tell you?  It's the continental belt.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  The intercontinental belt.  Just give me a number.  It's not really as big.  Oh, that CD?  Do you need an extender?  Who's the intercontinental belt?  Oh, no, I can go to the back.  Yeah, I can go to the back.  Don Morocco.  That's right, Don Morocco.  Yeah, he had that a lot.  For a long time.  Bob Backlund would always go.  Yeah, the... 
[01:43:30]  Don Morocco.  The useless title.  That title's useless.  Don't say the number, either.  Travis.  Okay.  The runner-up in the side-side contest.  Who also wins.  He will?  No, not the runner-up.  Oh, the runner-up.  Travis, stay focused.  Oh, boy, Travis.  Edgar will not leave.  Oh, really?  Edgar's been clawing at your arm.  So, just to...  You don't even have to follow along out there.  Just listen to these stupid songs again.  Basically, this guy, if we took E-Rock's vote out of it, he would have came in second 
[01:44:00]  place.  No, wait.  Yeah, the runner-up to...  The runner-up in the side contest is this.  This guy doesn't win money.  Okay, okay.  Is that right?  Not a penny.  This guy does not win anything.  Nothing.  Except applause.  Yes.  And then the next one that you play...  But this guy would have moved way up if E-Rock didn't have a vote.  But you're playing another track after this, right?  Yes.  Okay.  For the $500 gift certificate.  Yes.  Okay.  Don't follow along out there at this point.  I get it.  You don't listen that closely to this shit.  Don the Magnificent Morocco is horrible. 
[01:44:30]  It's the original rock.  Look at those big shorts.  Don Morocco.  The original one.  The Magnificent one.  Don Morocco was the intercontinent.  He would fight Tony Atlas.  Would he?  Yes!  He would fight the shit out of him, too.  Jeez, he looks mean.  Oh, he would fuck you up.  For newspaper use only.  He's a big dude.  Newspaper use.  This is illegal, what we're doing.  Oh, man.  That's when guys used to grow, like, body hair.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Something happened.  You don't see body hair on these lunatics anymore. 
[01:45:00]  You know they used to actually put wrestling results in the newspaper?  In the sports section.  Nice.  It's like wrestling results.  Worked everywhere.  Is that Don Morocco now?  I thought it was.  Oh, man.  It could have been.  It kind of looked like him in the face a little bit.  It did look like him.  Let me see him.  You sure?  Go back to that.  Put Donnie M back.  No, that's not him.  No?  No.  He's got a name tag that says Bert something.  I bet Don Morocco's dead.  No, he's not dead.  No?  We've seen Don Morocco.  He's the Magnificent one.  Oh.  I've seen him at conventions.  I've never gotten a picture of him.  How does he look? 
[01:45:30]  Does he get a line of people?  He does all right.  How's his muscles?  Better than Virgil?  He does a lot better than Virgil.  Yeah.  Right there.  He's thick.  He doesn't have the definition he used to, but he's still thick.  He's still fucking punching me in the mouth.  Oh, God.  He would knock your teeth out still.  No problem.  All right.  So this guy would have moved way the fuck up the list if V-Rock didn't have a vote.  Right.  So one more time, and probably the last time, unfortunately, you get to hear this.  Please allow me to introduce myself.  I'm a man of size and weight. 
[01:46:00]  Size and weight.  Worked in radio for a long, long time, but my skills are far from great.  Woo-hoo!  Write fan fiction and I hate my job, cause they make fun of my shape.  Had to stay home after Sandy left, cause a branch blocked my escape.  What are you?  Oh, man. 
[01:46:30]  I'm an asshole.  Yeah!  Don't you guess my name?  E-Rock.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  I'm an S-X-Vago.  Food, food.  And I don't watch sports at all.  Food, food.  You hear food, food, right?  I bring that into the table.  Food, food.  I love garlic.  Butter, salt.  So if you see me, show some sympathy.  Cause I don't count calories. 
[01:47:00]  I shouted out, who broke the toilet seat?  Who did it?  When all the while, I knew it was me.  Well, who are you?  It's me.  What are you?  I'm an asshole.  Oh, yeah.  Don't you guess my name?  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  Sex bagel.  Sex bagel.  We got some creative, talented people out there.  Talented people.  They should send in some shit just out of nowhere, man.  We'll play more of your stuff, Sean.  That was really good.  By the way, this is all leading towards Bageling with the Sex, which premieres Saturday night. 
[01:47:30]  Premieres?  Two days away.  6 p.m.  Eastern.  Meaning it's not a one and done.  Right now it's only scheduled at once, but that's not to say.  All right.  Finally.  So if we took E-Rock's votes away from the contest.  Bageling with the Sex.  This guy.  I don't know.  It's the worst.  I don't know who came up with that title.  Bageling.  I think it was E-Rock.  So if we take E-Rock's votes away, we have another $500 gift card for the moral victor here.  Yes.  Right?  If you use the noun and the verb. 
[01:48:00]  That's right.  It works.  You could have sexing with the bagel.  A lot of people suggested that.  It was turned down.  But bageling with the sex is so stupid.  It works.  I love it.  But it's really stupid.  E-Rock is a dinosaur marching, marching.  E-Rock is a dinosaur.  Why do you think he's fat?  It's Edgar.  Yeah.  That guy rules.  So obviously E-Rock army nigga who won the entire E-Rock contest. 
[01:48:30]  If we take E-Rock's votes away, he would not have won.  But George Huck is, don't worry.  You got the $500 gift card from IHStevenSinger.com.  It's in the bag.  So for the moral victor here.  And another $500.  And another $500.  This is what would have won if E-Rock didn't have a vote.  Which one is it?  I don't even know.  Oh, I think I know.  Playing track three, right?  Trey.  Oh, yeah.  Trey.  So this guy wins $500 thanks to IHateStevenSinger.com.  Josh Howe, congratulations. 
[01:49:00]  Yes.  E-Rock is a dinosaur.  You know Opie and Anthony and little Jimmy Morden, Travis, Al, and Danny, Roland, Troy, and Sammy.  But do you recall the most morbidly obese one of all?  Who is it?  E-Rock, shit, dick, fat fuck.  Oh. 
[01:49:30]  He's a lazy piece of shit.  Piece of shit.  And if you ever saw him, you'd know him by his huge bitch tits.  Bitch tits.  All of the other assholes.  Assholes.  Lassen called him Piggy Boy.  Piggy Boy.  They never let poor E-Rock.  E-Rock.  Have his hoagies and his shitty toys.  Ooh.  I like it. 
[01:50:00]  And there you have it.  That's a good one right there.  How dated is that song going to sound when Sal gets fired?  Because it's like his name.  His name's at the beginning.  It's going to be like, oh, remember Sal?  We're not going to be able to play it anymore.  Yeah.  It's going to be like, oh.  No one's going to understand.  We'll just bleep it out.  Yeah.  Put in somebody else.  Someone else.  John.  Easily replaced.  Just like a lyric.  You put in another name.  That's it.  Totally different voice.  Put in another name.  You know what Sal was doing yesterday?  Nothing.  Well.  I figured I'd play the odds. 
[01:50:30]  He kept playing E-Rock jingles every time E-Rock walked into the office.  Oh.  A little something.  A little something.  What is that?  I know.  I saw him earlier.  What is that gnome-lummox?  That idiot.  Gnome-lummox.  A giant gnome-lummox.  That hat has nothing to do with the weather outside either.  No.  Of course not.  It's like all about his gut, man.  It's a lot of the wool pointy hats with the long wool fucking pegs that come down from 
[01:51:00]  a ski hat with one of those little pom-poms on the top.  The hipster fucking-  He's going for the look, you think?  It used to be the grunge hat.  Yeah.  It's the worst.  I see that in L.A. a lot.  I like to wear a hat that just says team on it.  Nice.  Really?  Nice.  All right.  So that's it for the E-Rock side contest.  Yep.  That was great.  But here's the beauty of it.  We still have the O&A audio contest we're going to get back into-  Of course.  Probably tomorrow or next week.  I don't know.  We'll give it away by Thanksgiving, right?  After Thanksgiving. 
[01:51:30]  We can.  Yes.  Do we have new entries to play that we haven't heard yet?  I can get you some.  Yeah, we should.  Maybe tomorrow.  Now we're back on the O&A audio contest.  But here, I know what you're going to say.  I was going to say the ones that we played weeks ago are even going to sound new to a  lot of people.  Plus the fact that some of these E-Rock ones do have a chance of winning the entire fucking  contest.  Absolutely.  And here's what's even tougher, is that so many of these E-Rock ones we all love now.  Yeah.  How do I put- 
[01:52:00]  I'll tell you what the winner should be.  E-Rock is a dinosaur marching, marching.  E-Rock is a dinosaur.  Why do you think he's fine?  There you go, the T.  You got his voice already.  But I'm happy we got-  Who is it?  Thanksgiving.  Thanksgiving.  Right around the corner.  Giving.  Turkey.  The turkey.  Yes.  Mashed potatoes. 
[01:52:30]  Ha ha ha.  We, we, we are gonna have a good time.  The turkey.  Mashed potatoes.  It's Thanksgiving.  Giving.  Giving.  Giving.  Giving.  That, that, that is better than the Hanukkah song.  It's a huge hit as far as holiday songs go.  That's the number one.  That's moving up the charts.  Seven and a half million fucking views already.  Look how-  It's better than iPhone 5.  Hell yeah.  What's the likes, uh, dislikes ratio?  I've never seen a video like that that has millions of views. 
[01:53:00]  Yeah, but look at-  Give a little volume.  Oh, we got it.  15,000 people like it.  Okay.  How many don't like it?  Uh-oh.  111,000.  Wow.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  We full screen this bitch.  It's Thanksgiving coming up.  I wanna see me some little girl feet.  Come on.  Danny, I can't see it.  What are you, at home, hanging out?  Two.  Stink.  Thank you, thank you.  She's barefoot.  Yeah.  You could do a turkey foot on her.  Yeah, nice tootsies. 
[01:53:30]  Was it?  Yeah, what is that?  Oh.  How cheesy.  That's my new favorite part.  All right, everybody.  Oh, oh, oh.  It's Thanksgiving.  Giving.  Oh, oh, oh.  She's pouring stuffing.  What are you gonna have on Thanksgiving? 
[01:54:00]  This is lame.  Oh.  Yeah, look at her tootsies.  She's a foot goddess.  Worship those tootsies.  Oh, mac and cheese.  Yay.  Oh, wow.  I don't know what happened to the fucking video.  Danny.  Danny's jealous.  Because I used to like his bottom.  Thank you, thank you.  Thank you.  How does a 12-year-old get away with dancing until dawn, by the way? 
[01:54:30]  Especially with a black man over at their house.  She's got a shirt on the whole video, dancing until dawn.  Oh, look at this guy.  Is that the Elmo guy?  I know.  Yeah.  It was Easter.  His big dummy earrings.  And the 4th of July.  Uh-oh.  Why does he make, like, that whack-a-mole entrance?  It's ridiculous.  He does.  He kind of pops up out of nowhere.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  We are gonna have a good time.  Fucking Chris Hansen sitting at the table.  Eating turkey legs.  Why don't you have some turkey and mashed potatoes? 
[01:55:00]  Why don't you have some turkey?  Mashed potatoes.  Oh, I see you brought the turkey, mashed potatoes, and condoms.  Oh, great.  And Zima.  Oh, God.  Black guy runs in just like a turkey.  Why does he have to be in the video?  The rap.  Forgiven?  It's good.  It's all wiggerish.  Is this, uh...  It was written for her.  She was just reading it.  Yeah, of course. 
[01:55:30]  Is this Bon Jovi's daughter?  Ribs.  He's eating ribs in a chicken suit.  Why wouldn't they be?  Of course.  Get a chicken in a rib suit.  Thanksgiving!  Come on!  Come on what?  Oh, now she takes the turkey leg.  I love what she sings into the turkey leg.  It's like a microphone with hair on it.  Sing it to the hairy mic. 
[01:56:00]  Salt and pepper hairs on it.  With dandruff on my thighs.  You know what?  I give this two thumbs up.  Yeah.  Show those tootsies again.  Thanksgiving!  And there's a criminal in the video.  Oh, brother.  Where are we at with Jimmy's party video?  Are we doing it?  I would love to.  I can't wait for a big follow-up song, Christmas. 
[01:56:30]  Yes.  We need...  And New Year's.  And the presents.  The presents.  We need someone that's going to do us a favor for the radio show and produce the Jimmy party video.  Yeah.  Because we need real shit.  We need a nice set.  We need real cameras.  Not our shitty ones that we walk around with.  What do you think?  Can someone help us out?  Yeah, we got to do that.  Maybe we can promote your company or something.  We can't really pay you.  Yeah, is Noah's dad listening?  Please get in touch.  Oh, yeah.  We do want to make a Jimmy parody song video. 
[01:57:00]  Like these videos that are popping up left and right now.  All right.  It's Christmas.  Can we take a break?  Thanksgiving.  Thanksgiving.  Time to get my pictures.  Thank you, thank you.  She's going to be eating turkey and stuffing.  Having fun.  Yeah.  At Thanksgiving.  Two thumbs up.  Two thumbs up.  She should write a song about what really happens at Thanksgiving.  Where your grandfather gets too drunk on bourbon and just passes out on the couch.  Yeah.  Thanksgiving.  Have to sit next to the uncle who molested you and you never told. 
[01:57:30]  Now pass him the corn.  Yeah.  The fat ant puts raisins in the stuffing.  Someone mumbles, cunt, and she hears him.  And the black man shows up.  And two drinks later, the ant bombs are flying.  Thanksgiving.  Thanksgiving.  I like how she's Spanish.  Yes, she is. 
[01:58:00]  Right after the turkey man leaves, the jewelry is missing.  Thanksgiving.  A bunch of white girls and this man.  My daddy's a cuckold.  Thanksgiving.  Daddy is prepping the bull for Thanksgiving.  Yes.  He's breeding my mother.  Oh, the black cock.  The cream pie. 
[01:58:30]  The white one.  Oh, my God.  You really have a dark meat, white meat thing on.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Two thumbs up.  Jimmy Norton.  Very good.  All right.  We'll break again.  Big hit.  Big hit.  It has potential.  I don't know what the fuck.  We're getting new decks, but we're professionals.  Whatever.  We'll certainly figure it out.  It's going to be great.  It certainly will be, Sam.  Coke floats in my cup. 
[01:59:00]  E-Rock Army, nigga.  E-Rock Army, nigga.  E-Rock Army, nigga.  Serious XM.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Hey!  Hey!  I'm a child.  Here we are.  Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.  My eyes are burning. 
[01:59:30]  Burning today from playing Call of Duty.  Really?  Black Ops 2.  Getting better online.  Well, let me tell you something.  I got my, what is called a Zim Edge.  That's X-I-M.  Not a commercial.  Just something I use.  It's the Zim Edge.  And what you do, you plug that bad boy into your Xbox, right?  Then you plug a mouse and keyboard into the Zim.  And that fucker rocks just like a PC. 
[02:00:00]  No lag.  No bullshit like the old adapters you used to try to hook up and you'd move the mouse and it would take a while or it would clip or it wasn't fast enough.  This fucking thing brings the whole PC gaming experience, which I like playing, to the platform games where everyone's playing.  See, I can play on PC, but no one I know plays on PC.  So you play with a bunch of computer nerds.  So I can play on Xbox now with all my pals out there. 
[02:00:30]  And I'm not handicapped with that stupid fucking controller that I never grew up using for video gaming.  I grew up using mouse and keyboard and I know how to fucking, you know, maneuver and shoot using a mouse and keyboard.  So you got a lot better because you're using this way.  In seconds, I am fucking owning.  Do you watch over-the-air broadcast television or have you learned to use cable? 
[02:01:00]  All right, Danny Ross purist motherfucker.  It's a fair question.  I watch the technology that is available to me and everybody else.  Well, availability does not mean that it is a prerequisite to play the game.  Look, and I feel that a console game is a console game because everybody is playing it in the same way.  So a race game, you shouldn't have a steering wheel?  Well, I don't know the detail.  I can't argue the steering wheel aspect of this. 
[02:01:30]  No, because I'm not prepared to argue it, honestly.  Like, I don't know.  In a racing game, there's never a need to turn around instantly.  Yeah.  Okay?  There is a need for that in Call of Duty.  Yeah.  So when you could turn around instantly in Call of Duty, that gives you an advantage.  There's not a turn around button.  I have to move the mouse.  Sure, but there's also auto-aims in Call of Duty.  So not only are you being pinpoint accurate, but you're being pinpoint accurate with help.  No, no, not with help.  It's no auto-aim.  I've got to fucking put that reticle right on the bad boy. 
[02:02:00]  But I can fucking shoot a square on the face right across the map.  Because there's sensitivity issues that you can get around with something like this.  So I'm more accurate with a mouse than I am with that stupid joystick-y thing.  No, because the device allows you to move your axes quicker than you would be on a joystick.  Perhaps not, because I've seen people fucking own with a controller, and I don't win every match.  No, no, no.  I'm down in the middle of the pack.  I'm sorry, what's the name of this device?  I can't remember.  The XIM, the Zim Edge.  Oh, oh, the Edge.  That's right. 
[02:02:30]  Oops.  It's not called the Zim Leveler.  It gives an edge to the people that are used to playing with a mouse and keyboard.  It gives an edge to the people who have never picked up an Xbox controller and figured out how to use it the right way.  It's affirmative action for the people.  It's called, I suck at this game.  What can I buy to make me better?  No.  Am I the judge here?  Danny's kicking your ass.  But, I'm closer in age to Anthony, so I kind of get his point. 
[02:03:00]  We didn't grow up with the controllers.  We stink.  When you're in your 40s, you stink at it.  Do you just mouse over to the guy's head and just right-click for headshot?  At what point do you start doing that?  No, you can't do that.  Where does it start and where does it stop?  Well, I'm still only using what's available on the controller, but I'm using it on my mouse and keyboard.  So, I can move it just like you can with the joysticks on the controller. 
[02:03:30]  And I don't have extra buttons that do special things like spin around 180 degrees.  I don't have that button.  Because you haven't figured out how to program it that way.  No, it can't be programmed like that.  I've got to use the mouse.  It's available to everybody.  It's technology that's available to anyone that wants to get it.  When I buy my Xbox 360, does it come with this?  No.  Well, then you shouldn't use it in a game.  I'm not saying that you shouldn't use it, but saying that just because it's available to everybody doesn't mean that just because you have it, everybody else should go have it.  And then fuck you because you don't have it. 
[02:04:00]  No, because there are people that hate mouse and keyboard that use controllers and do very well with a controller.  I don't, so I got this.  What about ergonomic controllers then that are actual controllers, but they're laid out different?  You're trying to argue a third-party controller system.  You're saying, hey, I don't like my controller.  I want to use a different controller.  And you're saying, well, I'm using a different controller.  My controller happens to be a mouse and keyboard.  What I'm saying is that platform gaming as a whole is because we're all using the same hardware.  Everybody has the same graphics card, the same processor, the same output for the most part. 
[02:04:30]  It's an all-in-one system so that it cannot be fucked with, so that everybody is on a level playing field.  And that boils down to the control system as well.  So when a system is packaged with a controller, that's the controller that's meant to be used.  That's when these games are being designed.  They're being designed for use with these control systems.  So when you then put a mouse and a keyboard in, you're taking that and turning it upside down.  So you're being selfish because you want to play with your friends when you should just buy the goddamn game for your PC.  No, I need to play with my friends. 
[02:05:00]  And fuck it, I'm owning.  But why can't you just admit that, yeah, this controller gives me an edge over the average Xbox 360 Call of Duty player.  No, I'm not saying that.  It gives me an edge over myself playing with a controller.  Now, but I don't...  It's very rare that I'm at the top of the pack at the end of a fucking round.  I see what you're saying.  I think what you're saying is like maybe a kid, like a 12-year-old kid who's like, I just kicked your ass.  It's like if you put him behind a mouse keyboard situation, he would suck a dick. 
[02:05:30]  He's going to suck like I would with a controller.  I agree.  But the game was designed to be played with the Xbox 360 controller.  If you want to play Counter-Strike, be my guest.  Where are the Danny Ross rules of fucking...  I haven't seen this written out that you have to have the controller.  And no one's saying it.  But when it comes down to it, if I'm playing a Call of Duty game and 9 out of 10 people are playing with the controller  and there's this one guy who's tearing shit to pieces and he's using one of these Zim controllers,  well then fuck you and I don't want to play with you.  Oh man, well I won't tell anybody on there that I'm using it. 
[02:06:00]  Tell everyone here though.  We got a guy from California.  He plays in tournaments.  Oh yeah, tournaments.  It's a different story.  Well, let's see what he says.  Greg in California.  Greg.  Good morning.  How are you?  Hey Greg.  Alright, Greg.  I do play in tournaments.  So you know I'm not full of shit.  The next one I'll be playing in is on Saturday this week, the 17th, right outside of LA.  This guy is definitely legit.  You know what?  You're not full of shit.  What's your point?  Very good. 
[02:06:30]  You're specifically told to bring your own controller, but any third party controller is not allowed.  It's exclusively the edge because it does give certain people an advantage to the game.  Alright.  Well, you know what?  That's a tournament.  Not fucking gameplay on the computer.  I take mulligans when I golf, too.  I don't see fucking Tiger Woods doing that.  I take gimmies on the green.  And Anthony seems to think that just because Microsoft won't ban you from Xbox Live for using it, that it's morally okay to use it during a multiplayer session. 
[02:07:00]  It's allowed.  It's allowed because it's just simply a third-player device.  Yeah, third-player device.  Yeah, but there's no official...  You're not hacking anything.  You're not altering any code maliciously in any way.  No.  So that's Microsoft's stance.  But I think morally, I think your fellow gamer is like, fuck you.  Well, you know what?  When I have two kills and 51 deaths with the controller, I've had it.  Well, hey, I wasn't a happy boy, you know, switching over from PC gaming. 
[02:07:30]  Can you shut the fuck up over there?  Yeah, yeah.  I got rid of him.  I wasn't happy going from PC gaming to the controller with everything because it was difficult.  But, you know, you just gotta...  That's where it's going.  I will be honest with you.  Before I got the Zim and I got the game and I was playing it yesterday, I was getting better with the controller.  But...  Just keep going.  No.  This is fucking great.  Because you know other people are out there using this.  Well...  So you might as well use whatever's available to you. 
[02:08:00]  Great point is coming in on my Twitter.  Somebody says...  You might as well.  Steroids are available to everyone.  And that's cheating.  It's...  If you get caught.  If you get caught.  This isn't illegal.  If you get caught.  Wonderful.  But it's an edge-giving thing and it's available to everybody.  It makes up for my fucking upbringing and my lack of...  It's affirmative action for gaming.  Exactly.  I am a poor black boy as far as gaming goes.  And I need a boost.  Yeah, but you know what it is?  It's the game that everyone...  It's the big game that everyone's...  It's playing and how embarrassing is it if you suck? 
[02:08:30]  And that's where it comes in.  It's where it's like, I can't suck.  I have to be better than suck.  And I'll spend money on third-party peripherals to do whatever it takes to make sure that I  don't...  I'm not eating my ass in public every day of the week.  You know what?  I'd rather be able to run toward an open doorway, right?  Spin around backwards and run through the door backwards while I'm covering myself than  forward in slow motion.  Not even be able to get through the door because I'm bouncing off the door jam.  You don't have...  Because I can't even figure out how to go through an open door.  You can't buy your way to the best of everything. 
[02:09:00]  Yes, I can!  Maybe this could just be something that you're not good at.  No, I rule now.  You're not good at the game.  I rule now.  You're just not good at it.  My aunt is sticking up for the middle-aged man.  I love it!  We want a game, too!  I thought you were trying to the 80s.  Oops.  Oops.  I love the Zim and fucking...  Stick up for us, brother.  Stick up for us.  Black Ops 2.  That's right.  Go use your fucking mouse and keyboard for Donkey Kong, which...  Oh, man!  Is it left shift or right control that jumps over the barrel? 
[02:09:30]  I'm all for the Zim.  You know, the Zim rules.  No, Zim.  The Zim rules and fucking Black Ops 2 is the shit.  It's a pisser.  I've been fucking...  I was playing last night for hours on end.  I fell asleep.  Literally fell asleep playing the game.  Oh, we got...  Hold on, hold on.  We got someone that has been listening.  And he's got a very good observation.  Jeremy in Dallas.  Jeremy?  Hey, Danny is a communist and is using his means to get a leg up on capitalism and work. 
[02:10:00]  Good work.  Good work, Anthony.  I don't think that was really a compliment here.  I don't think he was really on my side, that guy.  By the way, Jeremy, you're going to the Addison Improv to see little Jimmy Norton.  I certainly am.  I can't wait to see little Jimmy.  Oh, the laughs are going to be abundant.  Starting tonight.  So get your friends to gold.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We don't have radio down there that we could depend on anymore.  So you use the Konami code in Contra, but you beat the game, but you just tell everybody 
[02:10:30]  that you beat Contra?  No.  I don't use cheat codes when I play single-player games, either.  I made it through the original, like, Half-Life years ago without any cheat codes.  Wow!  Yeah.  Really?  Very difficult.  Yeah, but you had to use a mouse and keyboard, you big faggot.  Well, it was a PC.  Hold on, man.  Let's go to Mike in Delaware.  The observations are coming in.  Go ahead, Mikey.  Yeah.  And Danny has to realize it would be no different than somebody wearing a pair of glasses.  Nice.  Oh.  It's the handicap that Anthony has.  It's cheating.  And we all know...  Another middle-aged... 
[02:11:00]  Yeah, but I'm not trying to see better than other people in some kind of public forum.  Hi, Danny.  What about a big-screen TV, Turtle Beach headphones, so you get the ambient sound behind you, and  shit like that?  What about all that stuff that makes the experience easier?  That's all stuff that's coming out of the game, like 5.1 sound is provided to you, and  if you're not taking advantage of the 5.1 sound, then it's who on you.  And this hooks right up to it.  Yeah, but you can't just...  But hang on.  You can't just plug...  Okay, so can you plug a keyboard and a mouse directly into your Xbox and play the game? 
[02:11:30]  No, I need that.  Then go fuck yourself.  Gizmo.  Sorry.  You need something to interfere with it.  I don't know.  You need something to interface with it.  It's just a game.  Yes, that's what we're doing.  You're manipulating code.  And when the game spits out a big-screen 10, 1080 lines of resolution and 5.1 different  audio channels, you're not manipulating anything.  You know what?  We've got another observation coming in.  You know, it's still out for debate here.  Greg in DC, go ahead.  No, it's not.  I won this a million years ago. 
[02:12:00]  Nope, nope, nope.  Go ahead, Greg.  Yeah, gentlemen, I'm a middle-aged man who has sex with women, so I don't have time to sit  in front of a computer all day, every day.  Oh, do you?  Do you?  You know what?  This argument was coming.  Somebody said something the other day.  They were like, oh, I don't have time for video.  I'm out banging chicks.  I don't like...  I bang chicks.  But how do you not find the humor?  It is funny.  But he's an asshole.  You know, it was comic books.  I love how he's...  Hey, gentlemen.  Somebody said, oh, I don't have time to read The Walking Dead.  I'm out banging...  I'm just like, if you read The Walking Dead comic books, you can bang girls who have read 
[02:12:30]  it.  Right.  It's a good way in.  But hold on.  Greg in DC, I think, is siding with you, Anthony.  Basically saying, because he bangs chicks, he doesn't have time to figure out the  controller for Call of Duty.  Oh, is that what we're saying?  So he's going to go with what he...  Even that's stupid.  Why?  I'm banging chicks.  That's right.  Are you banging chicks?  Greg, you tell him.  You are, right, sir?  Oh, God.  Yes, I'm banging chicks.  Yes. 
[02:13:00]  All right.  Well, then why would you do the Steve voice?  I know.  Let's go to Canada.  Canada.  Kelly.  Hey, how's it going?  Hi, girl name.  Oh, thanks.  Good evening.  No, I was just going to side with Anthony on this one.  No, there is no edge, because those guys are wired in with that joystick sensitivity  set so high.  That's true.  It isn't going to matter what he does.  What?  Yeah, you could set the joystick sensitivity on the controller so you can spin around in  a snap. 
[02:13:30]  That's what the guys really...  Oh, is that what you're trying to say?  The people that are playing are really good at it.  No, no, I still think there's definitely an advantage.  You're holding the...  It could be a different way.  It's a completely different avenue of playing the game.  There's no more of an advantage.  So why can't he play on a PC?  Because my friends are on the Xbox.  So they're playing with the Xbox controller.  There's not as many people are playing on the PC.  How am I supposed to play with drunk golf pro?  You learn on a controller.  How am I going to play with drunk golf pro and fucking...  You got to learn.  And big duties. 
[02:14:00]  We're done learning at our age.  Yeah, exactly.  If Anthony can't learn that 1963 in the South is over, how do you expect him to get in a  fucking joystick?  Jesus Christ.  Uh, yeah.  Nice.  Hey, if people think I get an advantage doing this, then let them fucking pick it up and  they can have an advantage.  Yeah, but no one wants to spend another hundred dollars to play a fucking video game.  Ah, we live in America.  Sorry.  Sorry.  Maybe in Russia they could play that game. 
[02:14:30]  That's right.  Putin would do it.  Answer this question.  So you could readily admit that without this, you're decidedly worse.  I suck.  So then it gives you an advantage.  It gives me an advantage over myself playing with a shitty controller.  But there's a lot of people who suck just as bad as you, and then you have an advantage  over them.  So now you're leaping over people who are your equals from simply buying a peripheral.  You've made your point, and now we've got the observations continuing to come.  Steve and PA.  Steve.  Yes.  All right, little Jimmy, you're cheating. 
[02:15:00]  Give up your sleep after you, man.  There you go.  That's true.  There you go.  I'm buying you.  What is it, a periphery?  That's right.  He should be dead.  Yes.  Yeah, my fucking, my soft palate and tongue have been complaining.  We're trying to murder this fat-titted zilch.  Stop cheating.  And you're keeping him alive.  It's cheating, though, Jimmy.  Stop buying third-party peripherals.  Keep your lungs open.  So an optic on a rifle is cheating.  We're not, we're talking about competing, a friendly competition with friends here.  Yeah.  And when everybody is competing in the same way, when it's to be assumed that everybody 
[02:15:30]  is playing in the same way with the same device.  That's the purpose of console gaming versus PC gaming.  PC gaming, people don't like PC.  You know why no one plays PC games?  Because everybody's computer is completely different.  And whoever, let the best PC win.  Console gaming evens the playing field.  So everybody is on the same shit.  Now you're taking that equation away, and you want to throw away the controller, and  you want to put your mouse and keyboard on, and that defeats the purpose of multiplayer  console gaming.  It's just the interface between me and the machine.  Fine, go and do it on a computer. 
[02:16:00]  It's not changing the machine, though.  We're not saying, I'm not saying that you're, that no one should, you could do whatever you  want, but it's shitty, and you shouldn't do it.  Let's go to George.  No, I love it.  George has a very good observation coming in.  George.  George.  He has, my brother and me play a game all the time.  My brother and I.  Oh, is it UndiFlip?  Yeah.  Anthony is right.  There's no level of playing field on that game.  They have controllers that's got buttons on the back of them, faster triggers, all sorts  of things.  Not only the speed of the cable, it's got a lot to do with it. 
[02:16:30]  I mean, there's no level of playing field.  The problem is everyone's doing it, so you can't control it at this point.  So you might as well get the best fucking controller you can get.  There are third-party controllers that are fucking tricked out.  What about the tricked-out controllers?  But you know what?  Here's the thing about the controllers.  When you hit that little Xbox button, it turns your Xbox on because it was made, it was designed  for the Xbox.  This is not designed to be made officially with the Xbox.  The third-party controllers that you're talking about are all officially licensed products.  This is not an officially licensed product. 
[02:17:00]  Oh, well.  And you're still interfering with the mechanics of the game.  A controller plugs into it.  Are we ready for the...  Are you going to have to agree to disagree?  Portion of the agreement yet?  I don't even play Call of Duty anymore, so I don't even give a fuck.  I'm just saying that if you need a controller and a mouse to play an Xbox game, then you're  a fag.  You should get better at it.  I'm a fag.  I fucking hate our listeners.  You should get better at it.  We've been talking about some great shit today, and the phone's just like crickets, but this,  they're all about it.  It's a giant game. 
[02:17:30]  It's a microchasm opium to society.  There you go.  Some of the calls coming in, we can take whatever you want.  I'm a PC gamer.  There are games that you can do so much more with the keyboard mouse.  That came in a couple times, as a matter of fact.  Then you got, what does Danny think about...  Modded controllers.  Modded controllers.  You just sort of talked about that, right?  Is Danny bitter because Anthony has been kicking his ass in the game?  No, he's not playing.  No, I don't fucking play.  I don't have the game, and I don't call it.  I agree with Danny.  You have an advantage.  But the problem is, you're playing with idiots that aren't going to keep it fair. 
[02:18:00]  Keep it fair, huh?  How do you keep it fair if no one else is going to keep it fair?  Golfers use different putters on the green.  Oh.  They don't use the same putter on the green.  There's another call coming in.  It's Jim from New York.  Yeah.  And he says, it's a fucking video game.  I love it.  It certainly is an argument that gamers have had for many years.  The people who are going to call in and defend Anthony are going to be the people who suck  at Call of Duty. 
[02:18:30]  And the people who are going to call in and say, and they're going to be in defense of  me, are going to be the people who know how to use an Xbox controller functionally enough  to not suck at a video game.  I'd probably say, come bring it.  I don't care about your mouse and keyboard.  I'll kick your ass anyway.  You know what?  Probably.  Yeah.  Hopefully.  I used to love gaming, but the console, I just couldn't fucking figure it out.  I wanted to play the hockey games and all that shit.  You have it in your hand, you're holding it, you're trying to work your fucking...  I hate it.  It's our middle-aged stupid brains.  It's like trying to learn a language at this age.  It's impossible.  I am not going to fess up to that. 
[02:19:00]  Have you tried Rosetta Stone?  I'm just going to say, it doesn't work.  Oh, you're not going to confess that you're as stupid as I am?  No, it has nothing to do with age.  It's the interface.  I think it is an age thing, though.  It's not as comfortable in my hands.  But I don't like holding the controller.  I like the controller flat on the fucking table.  So sit at your desk and play it on your PC.  No, because my friends are on there.  We get new friends.  Now I got an issue with you.  I think it is age.  Why do the kids figure it out like it's nothing and we can't?  Because they want to sit on your lap. 
[02:19:30]  You've played enough video games that you should have been able to figure out that console by now.  Well, because I don't like the console.  He likes to drink.  He wants his fans free to go over and grab a beer.  And that's how Anthony plays by it.  I can do that.  It's great.  With a console, it's harder.  I say we just stink at this age at learning new shit.  No, it's the...  And one of them is figuring out that controller for the complicated games.  First of all, I'm now in a position where I have to hold the controller.  What is Jimmy doing?  Work my pointer finger to fire and work my thumb to move the fucking guy. 
[02:20:00]  It's too much shit to be accurate.  But a 12-year-old picks it up like it's nothing.  Well, yeah, but it's too much shit to be accurate.  It's too much shit to be accurate, yet it's the best-selling game franchise ever, ever, ever.  Well, you know what?  But it sucks so much that it needs other things to help it.  I didn't say it sucks so much.  I love playing it even with the controller.  It's so inaccurate that you need third-party peripherals to enjoy the game the way it's meant to be enjoyed.  I love playing it even with the controller, because it's a fun game.  I really do like it. 
[02:20:30]  But when you watch, especially the last shot, and you see slow motion, they show the last shot of the round and who killed the last person.  A lot of the shots are like way to the left, and then they walk it in, that, that, that, right, that, that, that.  Like, even people that are...  The controller itself is inherently inaccurate.  So, Xbox made a faulty controller system.  No, it's their controller.  But I think a keyboard and mouse is a lot more accurate...  Well, then you're a PC gamer. 
[02:21:00]  Period.  That's the argument here, is that you want to play PC games, but since no one plays PC games and you're the last person,  you have to bring your keyboard and mouse over to the Xbox.  But that's where CokeLogic is.  Is he good?  And something tells me he probably just plays with a controller.  Probably does.  And kicks the shit out of you.  And drunk golf pro.  I have something that can bring us all together.  Titties?  What do you got, buddy?  We have uploaded eight of our E-Rock jingles.  We're back to that.  So, yeah, so technically, Titties. 
[02:21:30]  So, if you go to SoundCloud.com slash Opie Anthony.  Opie Anthony.  Opie Anthony.  No and.  Oh.  There's eight of our E-Rock jingles.  And do we have a link on the Facebook page?  The link is on the Facebook page.  And how do I link that shit?  I'll link that shit on my Twitter.  Fuck that.  People need to hear these things.  And what am I doing?  I'm on a tennis ball.  I worked out a lot.  I said my fucking back is killing me.  So, while you guys are talking, I'm just on the tennis ball on my back.  It's brilliant.  For the most hardcore gamers, Zim offers additional advanced options for further intricate refinement. 
[02:22:00]  That's what you're doing.  You're just refining your game plan.  That sounds good.  You're a reformed, you're a, well, what's the word?  Refined gamer.  I can program the keyboard for whatever buttons that are on the controller.  Through smart translators, Zim is able to provide unparalleled mouse precision, unachievable, by any other gaming adapter available.  Nice.  Adapter.  That's good.  It's fucking killer.  It's great.  Using the tools available to you.  You're not going to stop using those.  Fuck no.  I've taken heads off across maps. 
[02:22:30]  It's great.  Yeah, I don't have a problem with cheating.  And meanwhile, if you didn't have it, you'd be spinning in circles, throwing a fucking flashbang in yourself.  Right.  Falling off the fucking ladder halfway up.  I don't want to play with you anymore.  Knifing the air.  Oh, yeah.  Terrible.  Oh, that's another thing with the fucking controller.  That's what I've been doing.  The knife is the same fucking joystick as you move with, but you push it for the knife stab.  How many times I try to fucking move and shoot and my knife is out at 50 yards.  I'm stabbing the air and I get shot.  You know what I always see on YouTube?  People missing with their knives on YouTube. 
[02:23:00]  I miss on it with the knife.  I pull the fucking knife out.  In real life, just some retarded army guy just running around.  I have my gun, I lift it up to fire, and then instead of shooting, I pull my knife out and start stabbing at somebody that's 20 feet away from me.  Would you buy a controller for a baseball game that had a home run button?  It doesn't have a home run button.  It doesn't have a button that says, instantly kill guy in front of you.  I have to point, aim, shoot, move.  Hit right trigger for triple play.  Okay. 
[02:23:30]  No.  It's wonderful and I'm going to continue using it because it's marvelous.  I haven't played yet.  It's marvelous.  Are you going to play with a keyboard and mouse or with a big boy controller?  I'll play with a big boy controller.  But are you going to play multiplayer with all these cheats out there?  Yeah.  Cheats.  That's the only reason I like playing that game.  I like to play with all of our internet friends.  Don't click the L move button then, Ant?  I'm trying to move and shoot at the same fucking time.  How do you not hit that goddamn thing and pull that stupid knife out? 
[02:24:00]  How many times I try to shoot someone and the knife comes out?  It's fucking...  Didn't you say 10 minutes ago that you could change all the buttons around in game to wherever you want them?  Just change stab.  Yeah, but where are you going to put it?  I mean, really.  Oh, but caps lock.  Well, I have that somewhere.  I have left control as used for something.  What is print screen?  What do you have at?  Is that the heartbeat monitor that pops up?  No.  The print screen?  Actually, I'm not using print screen.  Reload's nice.  A quick button right off of the moving buttons. 
[02:24:30]  All right.  Agree to disagree.  After you shoot somebody, you should tell them that you used that.  Oh, yeah?  Just to ignore them.  Just to fucking annoy them?  Just to rub it in.  That's how I did it.  What's it called?  A Zim?  Right.  So you've been Zimmed, bitch.  Just Zimmed you.  I'm the Zim kid.  That should just be a name.  It's a recreational activity.  I love it.  Why not?  Who cares?  Oh, it's wonderful.  Your entire Call of Duty record.  Your entire Xbox Live account should just have an asterisk on it.  Really?  Yes.  Oh, you're the Barry Bonds.  I'm part of the steroid era.  I'm like the Lance Armstrong of the game. 
[02:25:00]  They'll figure it out eventually, but right now...  Yeah, but you have to be good to be the Lance Armstrong of the game.  Oh, shit.  You have a Zim and you're still mediocre.  I'm kicking ass now.  I'm kicking ass now.  You must have not had the Zim for that last call.  Are you going to play today?  Well, I didn't.  Are you playing today?  I'm playing today.  But your eyes are fucked up.  You get on there.  I don't care.  I'll fucking visine the shit out of them and keep playing.  Do you have gaming glasses yet?  No.  I don't need them because the TV's far enough away.  That's not the problem.  No, no.  Close.  No, it's just keeping your eyes open for so long. 
[02:25:30]  It's just, yeah, they're open and constantly moving around.  Is there a way to figure that shit out so you don't get that weird eye headache?  No.  Can I ask a question?  The human part of it.  Not do it.  The game.  Yeah.  The game.  Look at Tranny Port.  Is cheaper than the Zim.  Okay.  Yeah.  So why did you beg for the free game and then pay for the Zim?  Because they wouldn't give me the free Zim.  You should get in touch with Zim.  Yeah, definitely.  And it doesn't matter how much money you make.  It's great getting free shit.  Any other radio show. 
[02:26:00]  That is true.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, we should get a lot more games.  Yeah, have these assholes out there.  I had no idea.  Now they're ordering.  I could kick ass in Call of Duty.  Let me get this.  I'm going to kick ass.  I've been sucking dicks for five years.  Now I'm going to be good.  Exactly.  All right.  We're going to agree to disagree so we can go back to break, do some other shit.  I'm not agreeing.  Agreeing to disagree.  Agree to disagree.  I'm agreeing that I'm going to continue using this and fucking taking headshots from clean  across the map.  I saw on Twitter, Eric purchased Call of Duty yesterday, so maybe you can play with him 
[02:26:30]  today.  E-Rock, what's your gamer tag?  E-Rock Radio.  All right.  I had to stop myself.  You're not going to play.  It doesn't matter.  What?  You're not playing with me.  Why not?  We all play together.  Look at him.  He's like the kid in the schoolyard.  You don't want to play with me.  No.  Let's all get together.  He's like, I like me.  Let's all have a game.  My friends like me.  My wife like me.  Yeah, but they're all chewing the same piece of gum, though.  Oh, shit.  It's not like one person had fucking had chooly's gum and everybody's having tried it. 
[02:27:00]  Why don't you just have a stick of chooly's?  Oh, man.  You're not going to like my fighting style.  What's your fighting style?  You're a knife guy?  No.  I just crouch down somewhere and I shoot at objects.  And shit on the side of the expressway.  I don't have any.  Eric Hides.  You're a hider, aren't you?  Oh, you're a camp?  Yeah, you're a camper.  No, no, no.  I just crouch down on a spot and I shoot at things that have nothing to do with the game going on.  He even doesn't move in games.  He doesn't move in games.  Oh, look who's talking. 
[02:27:30]  Oh.  Whoa.  I don't even understand that.  What does that mean?  I don't know.  I just figured I'd go, whoa.  Yeah, what does that even mean?  What does that mean?  You were participating in the game discussion and now you're chiming in.  Oh, shit.  I participated.  Oh, you're chiming in.  I participated.  But I don't play Call of Duty.  I gave my little dumb two cents.  I openly admit it.  I can't fucking play these complicated games because I couldn't figure out the controller.  I'm just chiming in now.  I'm not good at the multiplayer sections when you're on aircraft carriers or the yachts.  You're constantly falling off into the water. 
[02:28:00]  That should have been a period, but all right.  There's a comma in there.  Oh, man.  Yeah, it sounds to me like you're trying to control everything from that thing.  All right.  Log on tonight there.  I'm looking at the instruction manual for this thing.  Let it load up for a second.  Yeah, hang on.  Yeah?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  What's the matter?  Hold on.  Page two.  The advantage of Zim Edge.  You keep telling me how there's no advantage. 
[02:28:30]  It's an advantage over using the controller when you can't use the controller.  I just like that that was the first thing I saw there.  What's the advantage?  What's it say?  Well, it generates bullet points, actually.  Yeah.  Great.  I think it should say fucking rules.  Yeah.  Fucking amazing.  You're not going to stop using it?  No!  I love that.  Oh, man.  It's so nice.  Now listeners will get an even bigger kick out of killing Anthony because they know what  an advantage is.  He's the Zim Kid.  Zim Kid.  Anybody who's playing later today with, what is it, Noodles? 
[02:29:00]  Noodles 61.  61.  Please, please kick the fucking piss out of him.  Oh, man.  With your Xbox controller.  You know what, Danny?  With your Xbox controller.  Even without saying that, that's what they do.  I get shot a lot.  It's still fun.  But, um...  Oh.  As long as you have fun.  It's online now.  It's nice.  I'll tweet it.  Hope you're ready on Twitter.  I'll give you the fucking E-Rock jingles.  Are you having more fun with the Zim than you did before? 
[02:29:30]  Oh, fuck yeah.  Then that's all there.  That's all that matters to me.  Isn't that all there?  It's entertaining.  Okay, so if the game is more enjoyable, play the single-player campaign.  And then play multiplayer with the controller.  That way you could have your Zim-ness that makes you get through the game the way you'd like.  And then you could get on an even playing field with the rest of the gaming community.  Danny, in the world that is the game and my gaming friends, I don't want to be the kid from Saturday Night Fever with the platform shoes. 
[02:30:00]  But there's a kid with those shoes in every game.  It ain't going to be me.  I don't want to be that guy.  I was that guy too long with the fucking thumb controller.  Exactly, but just admit.  Just admit.  He's not going to admit.  Just admit that whole thing and that this gives you the opportunity to not be that guy.  And that's the only reason why you're using it.  It's because it obviously makes you better than Controller Boy.  Yes, because I suck with the controller.  Because you can't hang. 
[02:30:30]  No.  Just admit that you can't hang.  I've tried.  You can't hang.  The controller is cumbersome to me.  You cannot hang with COD.  Cumbersome.  You can't hang.  I could hang with my mouse and keyboard.  I'll fucking hang a gun out a window and blow someone's head off clean across the map.  That's how I hang.  You should spin as fast as you want.  All of Eric's jingles already have hundreds of listens.  Wow.  We're all going to tweet them.  Listen, as we go to break here, we've got two people on the line.  One coming from Atlanta and one coming from Texas just to see little Jimmy Norris. 
[02:31:00]  Oh, good.  They're driving five hours to see you at the Addison Improv, Jimmy.  Oh, good.  Starting tonight in the Dallas area.  So very, very cool.  Jimmy, don't even do it live.  Just tape it.  It's the same.  It's no different.  The shows start tonight, right?  No, but I would, if there's something, yes, if something makes my job easier, I would be happy to take it.  Well, no, that's cheating.  Just show them an old set that you've recorded and just be like, here's my show, guys.  Speaking of old sets I've recorded, good segue.  He did that.  He did exactly that.  He took an old set and put it on CD. 
[02:31:30]  You idiot.  People aren't going to a comedy club to listen to it.  No Baby for You comes out December 11th.  It's a set I taped a few years ago.  It's a wonderful set, too.  Yeah, I love the set.  I'm happy with it.  I've heard it.  I'm not letting people know because I don't want anybody to think that I'm, you know.  Yeah, of course.  You're being fair about it.  Yeah, if you don't like that material.  Anthony just hides behind, uh.  This is my fucking Zim CD.  My Zim.  I got my fucking Zim CD.  I don't want to make lots of money with it.  We're going to go to break with an old clip of a kid playing Call of Duty.  Uh, Dudyo.  Call of Duty. 
[02:32:00]  And he's cursing his shit and his mom gets it.  That's the one where his mom gets it.  Is this the kid that wants the chocolate milk?  Yeah.  Yeah, we haven't played this in a while, but it's perfect for today, so check it out.  I don't want to play in that.  Why?  I need it up here.  I need it up there.  I need it up there.  No, I have to.  It's a clean mat.  I don't need anything.  I have to.  Stop.  No, I have to. 
[02:32:30]  Mom, I have to play in that.  You're messing me up.  You're messing me up.  You're messing me up.  You're fucking ready to play in that.  You're messing me up.  Mom, it's a clean mat.  You're messing me up.  Stop.  You're messing me up.  You're messing me up.  I'm going to really stop you.  Do it down low. 
[02:33:00]  No, don't put it on.  Mom, why do you not have enough glass?  I'm carrying my band.  You're not in band yet.  Why do you play in that?  Well, I need it up glass.  Mom, I need it up.  Mom, I'm messing me up.  Whatever.  I need it up.  I need it up.  I'm messing me up.  Don't be playing me.  Don't get off.  Why do I have to get off?  Mom.  Why?  That's stupid.  You always do that all the time.  You never want me to play it.  You always have to get off.  Get off.  Get off.  Get off.  It's time to get off.  I'm in the bed.  Time to get off.  Turn it down.  You never want me to have it up loud. 
[02:33:30]  This weekend, you're like,  you know, it's not,  during the weekend,  you're up as loud as you want.  So we can't right now.  So I'm getting it up.  Why?  Why?  Why?  Why?  Okay.  Why?  Why?  Why?  Why do I have to...  I want to play.  But that...  That doesn't mean that I should have to get off.  No.  That's bull.  I want chocolate milk, not fish.  He said that he is bringing me a drink.  I don't want to not do it. 
[02:34:00]  I want chocolate milk now.  I want chocolate milk now.  I want chocolate milk now.  Why?  That's what I want.  Why can't you get it?  Yes.  Mom.  Get it.  Get it.  Get it.  Mom, please get it.  Why?  That's bullshit.  You said you didn't get me a drink to do.  Why?  No.  You said you didn't get me whatever I wanted to do.  I said I'm out and do it.  Now I want chocolate milk. 
[02:34:30]  You're mean.  You bit it.  What?  I want some fucking chocolate milk.  Why would I get in trouble?  You said you'd bring me whatever I wanted to drink, and now you won't.  That means you're lying.  No.  Bring me chocolate milk.  Why?  I want some motherfucking chocolate milk.  I don't know how I can get up.  You said you'd get it for me.  Why?  That's bullshit. 
[02:35:00]  That's bullshit.  That's fucked up.  I don't have to do shit.  That's bullshit.  Take it.  Two, six, six, seven.  The OPD3 Show.  We'll be right back. 
[02:35:30]  We'll be right back. 
[02:36:00]  Hey, Jon Bon Jovi's daughter, this was very disturbing, huh?  Arrested after a suspected heroin overdose.  She's only 19 years old.  She's non-responsive in the paramedics.  Non-responsive.  That's scary, man.  So she's extremely lucky.  That's fucking scary.  You rock when we need something from the...  Hey, yeah, exactly.  Why don't you stop ODing on horse? 
[02:36:30]  I only use cool street terms.  Yes.  That's horrible, man.  Yeah.  She goes to college upstate.  Was it Hamilton?  Did they say that?  All right, Hamilton.  Oh.  Jesus.  Or is that from the other story?  Oh, let me do that.  Manny.  Sal.  Manny.  What do we know about her?  She's a cute girl.  Well, I mean, apparently there's heroin.  I mean, that's fucking scary for Ron Jovi.  19, doing heroin, ODing, apparently.  Hamilton College, yes.  Where's that?  Upstate New York.  Oh, it is. 
[02:37:00]  You should probably say that.  Apparently not getting, you know, maybe some of the family life she should be getting.  Maybe John's out on the road a little too much.  Wow.  Maybe that happened.  Maybe, but also, you know, you just openly blamed him.  Yeah.  Yes.  Yes, I did.  I don't know, man.  It could go either way with that shit.  I know.  It could be very nurturing and your kids turn into fucking assholes anyway.  Yeah.  I had an extremely strict mom, as most of you know by now, so when I went to college, fuck, 
[02:37:30]  I let, I was just ridiculous.  Yeah.  Yeah, because I wasn't really allowed to drink or anything around my house.  You know, there would be hell to pay.  Hell to pay.  So then I went to college, she probably assumed, oh, I raised a good boy.  He's not, he understands what alcohol is.  So I was a lunatic in college.  You know what it is?  I figured out years after college, but you don't want to do H.  You don't want to do the H.  He'll be hell to pay.  Yes.  Yes.  Yeah.  So I don't know.  It's easy to say, you know, maybe she wasn't getting the attention of, uh, the attention of 
[02:38:00]  Jon Bon Jovi, but I don't know.  Maybe, maybe it was the other thing.  They were too strict.  Yeah.  And then she let loose when she had her chance.  Because I know when I had my chance, I let loose.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's what people will do.  What do you think, Jimmy?  You know a thing or two about some of this shit.  I don't, I mean, again, I don't know, uh, the dynamics of them at all.  But there really is only so much you can do.  Somebody goes to college and gets wild.  I mean, you know, dad being away is probably a, uh, a stretch for heroin use. 
[02:38:30]  You think?  Yeah.  Like if she, that's a big one.  And even if he was there all the time, it's one of those things where you're with the boyfriend  probably has more influence in any, like, you know, when you're 19, then you're, you're  fucking rock and roll dad.  You probably ignore half the time.  I bet you we could go to the phones right now.  There's a ton of fucking parents right now that can relate to this shit.  On both sides.  Where they go, I, we know we raised her in a, in a very, you know, good way and a good  environment.  And then blank happened, you know, happened. 
[02:39:00]  That's, I think it's unpredictable, unfortunately.  Yeah.  Being unresponsive is scary.  Cause that means that she was fucking just about dead or close to death.  Yeah.  They're like, Hey, get up.  And she's like, I mean, she's just passed out.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Passed out.  He's gotta be fucking panicking.  Do I have to overdose on heroin?  At 19.  Oh boy.  It's horrible.  She's going right to rehab, I bet.  You think?  Yeah.  Yeah.  She got it talking to?  Yeah.  On horse, I ride.  Is that a steel horse? 
[02:39:30]  Oh.  I call her a horse.  So hopefully she'll be okay.  Cause I like Bon Jovi.  I feel, you know, it would feel bad when it's a guy you like and it's his family.  There certainly is a living on a prayer joke in there somewhere.  Oh, well, we can only hope.  Kind of just look at the songs.  Yikes.  Kind of twisted into some kind of comedy.  We like, uh.  Yeah.  We like Bon Jovi.  We like the guys.  We like them all.  Sure.  That one song he's got.  Fucking, that's amazing.  I'm a cowboy?  No. 
[02:40:00]  We're back.  I can't believe I never knew how pretty you are, standing there looking all pretty and  shit.  Pretty and shit.  I can.  Why?  I can't believe I never knew how pretty you are, standing there looking all pretty and  shit.  Pretty and shit.  But you're not doing your trademark.  If I had a million dollars, I'd give you half of it.  Half of it.  Your fucking songs suck.  You know what? 
[02:40:30]  I want to take just one of these because I know they're out there.  Here's one right now.  It's cock.  Jason, North Carolina.  Morning, boys.  Morning.  Hi, Jason.  I was just going to say, I'm 30 now and I have an identical twin brother who's also 30.  And we both became...  Did you start Facebook?  At a young age.  No, I hate Facebook.  I'm always on Facebook.  I'm not.  I don't like people knowing what I'm doing.  I'm too ashamed.  Nothing about Facebook.  Wait, wait, wait.  So you're both 30.  Twin brothers.  And you started doing heroin at a very young age. 
[02:41:00]  Yeah, we were both completely hooked by 18.  He stopped at 24, joined the Navy, and the rest of his life has been great.  I didn't stop.  I've been off and on.  And I'm finally turning it around, I guess, in the last year or so.  But we had a perfect upbringing.  I mean, my parents were still together.  I guess you could say upper middle class.  We never went for anything.  I mean, we weren't spoiled as having courses as kids and stuff.  But we didn't need for anything.  And my parents always blamed themselves.  But I think that if I would have been a race poor, rich, or mediocre, that no matter what, 
[02:41:30]  I would have ended up doing heroin.  It just seems like I had that personality and so did he.  That nothing could have stopped us, you know?  Where were you when you started doing horse?  I was in Florida.  I started on OxyContin in Florida.  And then, like everybody else that starts Oxy, you slowly start, you can't afford it anymore  and you move on to heroin.  Yeah, from Oxy, you go to smack.  Stop.  What's your fucking problem that you felt the need to do heroin?  I didn't have it.  That's the thing.  I didn't have any problems. 
[02:42:00]  He's trying to say he didn't.  Because, I mean, he's old enough to now kind of hopefully be a bit honest with yourself.  Yeah.  Did your parents give you everything you needed when you were growing up?  Did you ever have to work for anything?  No, I had to work.  I mean, I started working at 16 and never stopped.  But even when I had a heroin habit, I was still going to work.  Yeah, the only...  I mean, they did help with, say, like, I got a flat tire.  I didn't have any cash.  They'd say, all right, I will send you $200 to get your tires fixed.  Shit like that.  I mean, they didn't provide everything, but they helped.  The only experience I have is, like, you know, the rich kids that grew up around me. 
[02:42:30]  We certainly weren't.  They were the ones that were really fucked up.  And they were the ones that always had everything they ever wanted or needed.  And I wonder if that plays a part in this.  I never have any sympathy for fucking heroin, especially white heroin.  Yeah, what are you doing junk for?  What do you mean, especially white heroin?  What's the deal?  Yeah, it's just fucking...  It's more a chic thing to do.  Like, oh, look at me.  I do heroin.  I'm cool.  Oh, yeah.  Enough of your fucking stupid heroin.  So you know people like that?  No.  Oh.  Just imagine it. 
[02:43:00]  I was too scared to even just get drunk.  How do you start doing heroin when you're still under your parents' roof, more or less?  Yeah, you're 19 years old, you start chasing the dragon?  What are you doing?  Well, Anthony, I mean, he's talked about taking Percocet and how he loves to feel like Percocet.  No, he's talking about the type of breasts he likes.  By a hundred.  Percocet.  Will you let us laugh?  That's fucking funny. 
[02:43:30]  A Percocet.  That's so dumb.  In a good way, though.  No, sir.  I've never take Percocets.  You said that you've taken it and liked the feeling.  Maybe it was Vicodin.  It was Vicodin.  And I wasn't...  It was for a tooth pulled.  I had a tooth pulled, so I got...  A hundred pills.  I got a hundred pills.  A nine-year prescription for Vincor.  The pain's almost gone.  Exactly.  I still feel a tinge. 
[02:44:00]  Yeah.  Anthony and Wilson did it together on an island.  A hundred pills for a tooth.  Yeah.  That would be a sick doctor.  Eighteen prescriptions until 2020.  Anthony called Dr. Conrad Murray.  And he hooked him up with me.  It seems to me when white teens take heroin, that it is such a, not even a cry for help.  It's a fucking self-centered look at me. 
[02:44:30]  They love telling their friends they do it.  They do it, horse.  It's just such fucking bullshit.  You think?  Yes.  Stop doing junk.  You think it's that easy?  Yeah.  You really do, huh?  Yeah.  Because I'm a parent now.  I was ashamed.  I didn't fall into the Amazon, and I think you're wrong.  You thought it was cool, don't you?  Yeah.  I bet you were on Benny's, too.  Benny's and Dexy's.  Yeah.  Uppers, downers.  Yeah.  Goofballs.  Well, when I was doing it, I knew I was destroying myself.  I knew I was ruining my life, but I just love the feeling too much.  I mean, it's like taking a bike, you can only multiply that feeling by a thousand, and 
[02:45:00]  that's how it would be.  Oh, please.  All right.  That's what happens when a mongoloid gets a teabag somebody.  They get goofballs.  Smell like onions and fucking dirt in the yard.  Just from sitting there all the time in short skin, fucking pinworm.  Onions and frustration at math.  You know what makes us really happy and makes us feel good, Jason?  Warm Pop-Tarts, and they are arriving.  Ah, yeah.  Here it is.  Jason. 
[02:45:30]  The white man's burden, Lloyd.  The white man's burden.  I only have one toaster.  I gotta go, boys.  I'm at the methadone clinic.  What's the matter?  Gotta do some heroin?  At the clinic.  He's nice.  I'm worried about him.  He's a twin.  He was with a girl named Abigail.  They were doing junk.  What kind of junk, Quince?  They were doing heroin.  Raising a good upper middle class home.  Never wanted for anything.  I worry they're with the wrong girl. 
[02:46:00]  I love it.  They cut it up on my girlfriend's ass.  It was flatter than an album.  They cut up the junk.  Quincy's girl's got a really flat ass.  It's terrible.  You see it at the beginning of the show.  Detective Monaghan.  He's always ragging you, Quince.  If this guy voted for Rami, you should have had a little more sympathy for him.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, he's one of your guys, man.  My guy.  Yeah.  Because he's white like your heroin.  All right, man.  I prefer brown heroin like Sam. 
[02:46:30]  Sam's dark hair.  One time, my girlfriend found a bunch of dark Asian hairs in my underpants.  Uh-oh.  I had no explanation.  You don't even know where that came from, Quincy?  I said it was an autopsy.  Autopsy pubes in your underwear?  Yeah.  I said he was so dead, I jumped for joy and scraped the table.  You want another story?  About the H?  All right.  Another story. 
[02:47:00]  We got Nick.  Nick, what do you got, buddy?  Oh, just glad you got here in time.  So, my father's a judge and my mother's a high school guidance counselor.  I was raised perfectly, and I wound up becoming a really bad addict.  Started out with psychedelics, led to Oxycontins, and then when I got into the heroin is when  I decided it was time for rehab.  Oh, boy.  How old are you, sir?  Ray, 33.  Don't forget you were raised by law and order people, though.  Guidance counselor is like a school person and a judge is a judge. 
[02:47:30]  Maybe you always had to be on the straight and narrow or arrow.  Straight and narrow, I would say.  Sure.  Something like that.  And maybe that influenced you in a way.  You knew you couldn't ever get away with any shit, having a father that was a judge  and a mom as a guidance counselor.  I don't know.  My father actually arraigned my doctor when she got arrested for prescribing pills to people.  Kind of weird.  Whoa.  Are you clean now?  Yeah, five years.  Got my own business.  Now I'm voting for Republicans because I'm worried about my taxes. 
[02:48:00]  It's possible.  It's possible.  Well, good for you, man.  Yeah.  So I've been listening to you guys a long time, man, before Jimmy was part of the show permanently.  Whoa.  You insulting me, sir?  And he's not permanent yet.  We're still deciding on that.  Yeah, he's still on the bubble.  All right, Nick.  All right, boys.  Thank you.  Punch it out.  Yep.  By the way, I have to say to King Clark on Twitter, and I very rarely will bring out  Twitter people's names in public, you're just a fucking blocked cunt. 
[02:48:30]  God, fuck you and your obsession with politics.  Uh-oh.  I got mentioned on Imus.  And he's not even being that insulting, but this is why I despise people.  If, LOL, you were mentioned on Imus, no surprise.  I'll bet, I'll bet, uh, they, uh, as I, your name on Fox and Friends as well, you're a conservative  BS. 
[02:49:00]  It's coming to an end.  Feel free to invest in a time machine which can transport you and your fellow neocons back  from 1952.  First of all, you blocked fucking cunt.  First of all, gay marriage and all that shit that I'm for.  Yeah, real neocon views.  Second of all, Imus probably mentions me because I fucking stuck up for him in my HBO special,  and this show has a relationship with him.  Third of all, it just feels good to block you.  You fucking fruity, boring, fucking politically obsessed liberal. 
[02:49:30]  Yeah.  Fuck you and your fake Twitter name, cunt.  I'd hop in a time machine if I thought for a second in this, uh, environment that we  could actually build one, get the technology, it would be built in China.  If you could have a time machine, and you could go back somewhere in the last 70 years, where  would you go?  No.  I'd go way back.  I'd go way back.  I'd go back to 1937.  You gotta live in the 70s.  Yeah, the old days, high school.  Early 70s. 
[02:50:00]  High school.  Oh, man.  I'll go 50s.  I want to, I want to, I want to, I want to, I want to live in that, in that, uh, there  could be a nuclear war at any time mentality, like that whole vibe that was going on.  Like, I just got my new bomb shelter, Joe.  Right.  Come check it out.  Sure.  Yeah, tell them about it.  You come home and belt the wife in the face.  Yes, Danny, there were wonderful times.  Hey, see, I hate this music. 
[02:50:30]  That's why I'd have to kill myself.  This is bad music.  I'd have to bring some metal or something.  I can't do this.  You'd freak people out.  They'd be like, oh, Marty.  That was very interesting music, Marty.  I was doing the remix.  Now I got my warm Pop-Tarts.  Nice.  If you went to the 50s and auto-tuned something, would they think you were a wizard?  Oh, imagine that.  Wow, really? 
[02:51:00]  Imagine that.  What is that?  That would be scary.  Elvis fucking auto-tuned Elvis.  Yeah, or just like bring some Skrillex to the 40s.  Grab another dime.  You make nothing but a hand, dog.  I'd be great back in the 50s.  You'd be great knowing what you know.  Parents tell me to turn this devil music off.  There was no one like him, though.  There were all the guys around at that time.  This fucking guy stood out, man.  And you know there were all the guys trying to do the Elvis thing. 
[02:51:30]  You don't know their names, though.  But like doing it half wrong, like half-assed Fabian.  It's like a pelvis thrust, but it just came off all creepy.  It looks like he's air-humping.  Fabian.  Wasn't Fabian somebody that was supposed to be like Elvis?  Probably.  Yeah.  Fabian.  Fabian.  Shut up with his stupid mongologe voice.  That's a big bop of Fabian.  Oh, no.  Not today.  Not today.  No.  Our go-to material.  We ran out of material, obviously.  Fuck. 
[02:52:00]  What?  Will I plummet?  The engine's about to blow, baby.  Chantilly lace.  My body all over the place.  Pillow with some lace.  Chantilly lace.  And my fucking face is on the wing.  Chantilly lace.  Propeller in my face.  These are all repeats.  They have to be.  They have to be.  Iraq would know.  How many times have we done this, baby, Iraq?  Would you guess? 
[02:52:30]  Once a year since 2006.  You know what?  This is the second time this year.  I know that much.  Yes.  What?  What?  What?  Exactly.  What?  What?  What?  Oh, honey.  I didn't know you were asleep.  I told you I was coming.  Oh, what do you like?  Chantilly lace.  Had a pretty face.  Had a ponytail.  Yeah.  And the airplane's tail falling down. 
[02:53:00]  Make the work around, around, around.  Oh, God.  The oxygen mask's falling down.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Oof.  The video.  You like the video, Jim?  Terrible.  He's got the phones, the different phones on the pedestals.  Stinks.  Can you turn this off, Iraq, please, for the love of God?  I think you're onto something.  Going back in time, right?  Mm-hmm.  What would be the best thing to do?  The best thing to do?  Someone, I think, already has it. 
[02:53:30]  If you could go back in time, and maybe you could change history, all that shit, what  would be, like, the number one thing you would do?  You would change consoles so they don't have controllers anymore, and they would all come  pre-packaged with keyboards and mics.  Nice.  This guy on line one has a really good one.  What would you do if you could go back in time?  Think history.  Any time.  And now you already know what's going to happen.  Obviously, this is back to the future shit.  But what would you do?  Well, obviously, what?  Be the good guy and fucking choke Hitler in his crib? 
[02:54:00]  No.  Why would you do that?  Not the crib, man.  Yeah.  Oh, sorry.  But we are talking on that level.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Which one thing would you do, for real?  But you can't, because that would change history so drastically that it would fuck shit  up.  All of them would, though.  So you can't do it.  We learned from the back.  Maybe little things.  Mm-hmm.  You know what?  But I think if you had a time machine, let's see.  I don't know.  Go on the Titanic for a little while.  And then get yourself off of it before it sinks. 
[02:54:30]  How?  Let me go with the first one.  Let me go with the first one, and then maybe you got one.  Okay.  Jim in Maryland.  Jim, good morning.  Good morning, buddy.  It's weird.  I was watching this movie last night, and I thought about it.  Go back to the assassination of Kennedy.  Film it so that you can actually film the knoll, the winda, and everything.  You're not changing it.  The winda?  That's good.  As opposed to stopping the assassination. 
[02:55:00]  That's good.  Go back with your iPhone 5.  Just film it.  Put World Star Hip Hop across it and put it online.  Yo, that nigga's hat flew off.  Why didn't Zapruder do that?  Yo, we're so on.  Oh, that's all that shit.  Your brains got blown the fuck out.  Hit brain come out.  Hit brain come out.  Hit brain come out.  Hit brain come out.  Hit brain come out.  Hit brain come out.  Y'all think that bitch should be trying to grab me and shit right now?  Oh, yes.  Yeah, this ain't no cowboys in this Dallas. 
[02:55:30]  He just made some questions that no one else had.  Yeah.  I like that you wouldn't stop the assassination.  Yeah, exactly.  In a weird way, I like that.  But you would profit off it, making sure you got the perfect fucking video.  And dude, why would you film that instead of putting a little fucking GoPro camera in  Lincoln's booth at the fucking, at that assassination?  Something that's never been filmed in any way.  Because I don't think you can take back technology that wasn't made yet.  Oh, okay.  Who the fuck are you?  Yeah, we make our own rules.  Yeah, you got a time machine. 
[02:56:00]  How the fuck are you going to travel back in time, you asshole?  Right, if you go back in time, you can take whatever you want from the current time and  bring it with you.  That's a time machine made out of a wooden cask.  The second you go back before the time machine was invented, there's no more time machine.  So what are you going to do?  Are you going to travel back six months ago?  Your time travel rules suck.  That don't make no sense.  None, Chip.  You're fucking zooted.  Well, fuck you.  See you later.  All right, man.  Where would you put the camera, though?  Across the road, right?  No, I would just stand.  Yeah, I would just stand facing that way from where the Moore one was. 
[02:56:30]  Oh, that's great.  The what?  Where the Moore photo, where the Nick's picture was standing.  Yeah, but there weren't a lot of people on that side.  Yeah, I would photograph the knoll.  You got to be...  Or just go toward the grassy knoll.  You get down by the fucking...  In front of the limo and you film the whole thing back up with the window.  Do you have a lens cap on your camera the whole time?  Something would happen.  Or you would just film it and then you would come back in time and go,  I got the Kennedy film.  And they'd be like, what do you mean?  And then you'd realize that that film was taken already and nobody cared. 
[02:57:00]  Yeah, because it would have been taken already.  Yeah.  And you'd go back with the news and people are like,  we've seen this for 50 years.  Buzz off.  You think someone had a better video that day?  No.  There was a couple of videos.  There was Zapruder.  There was the...  I think her name is Mary...  Something more?  I don't remember.  Mary Tyler Moore.  No, no, no.  Yes, she was filming her hat up in the air.  She missed the assassination.  But what if someone had a video and they were too scared to ever, you know,  come out in public and say it was taken away?  Maybe, but there was... 
[02:57:30]  Maybe they were scared shitless that day.  There was one video a woman took from the book depository.  Book depository building!  But this dummy didn't know how to use the camera.  So through the whole assassination, she's filming the trees.  Oh, right.  Yep, yep.  I saw that.  Dumb broad.  Dumb broad.  What about people that might have done it and then sent it to get developed and it got  destroyed at developing?  Look, man.  I'm in that category.  I don't appreciate what you just said.  Oh.  What?  Because when Sully was landing his plane in the Hudson River, literally right outside  my fucking window, I, at the time, was not home. 
[02:58:00]  But there were a lot of people in my house with lots of video cameras laying around and  no one could figure out how to fucking get the camera working in time.  I'll give you the difference.  Dude, you know how much that video would be worth?  Make them do it again.  We, they saw it go pretty much right, well, it was below my window.  That's how low the plane was.  Here's the difference.  And then it crashed in the Hudson River a mere three blocks from my house.  That's something so sudden that you'd have to get the camera, turn it on, and you'd  miss the event.  They were all over the place.  That's true.  Very hard to do.  When the Kennedy was coming down, people were already filming him, and an event happened. 
[02:58:30]  Like, it isn't like...  You think it's a panic situation when that shit's going on?  Oh, yeah, dude.  You forget how to turn the camera on and all that crap?  I would agree with you if they were already filming the Hudson River, and then Sully landed  and they pointed the camera down.  Oh, so you weren't talking about me.  All right.  I want to make sure.  No, because you don't think to grab a camera at that moment.  You're watching a plane land on the Hudson River.  You don't think about capturing it.  You're thinking about what the fuck is happening.  What happens to your brain?  I mean, things you do, like, you don't even think twice about, but then you know it's 
[02:59:00]  so important, and all of a sudden, these basic functions you can't do properly.  Yeah, I can't do fast enough.  What is that about?  That's pretty good.  Yeah, there's a few, like, security cameras.  That's about it.  I'm telling you.  Yeah, a few security cameras.  Yeah, that was it.  This thing flew right below our window.  I was fucking my ex-girlfriend on the ass when that happened.  Why are you offering that up?  Because I remember it was weird.  Because he was on the flight.  Yes, I mean, metaphorically.  It is the famous, you know exactly where you were. 
[02:59:30]  Yep.  And, you know, Jimmy makes a good point there, too.  A lot of people were in horrific situations when these big world events happened.  Yeah, we were both, me and Sully, we were both dealing with some shit.  But I was fucking her in the ass.  I remember because I talked about it on stage that night.  Like, I could have been killed if that plane came.  But I was fucking balls deep and asshole.  Wow.  And she was going, uh-huh.  Really?  Uh-huh.  Taking some dick.  That's pretty cold, Jim.  That's a cute story. 
[03:00:00]  But he tells it like he just got a new kitten.  Oh, I know.  That's the beauty of it.  Yeah, I was fucking her in the ass.  It was adorable.  Oh, I like the animations that they made.  Yeah, they show the...  But no one got this.  What it did.  There's a rumor that someone in our building has a video.  And they will not give it up.  Why?  The doormen have told me a bunch of times.  I don't know.  Why won't they give it up?  Because they probably don't want, you know, to be in the public eye, having the video and  all that. 
[03:00:30]  Supposedly, it was filmed from our building.  Wow.  Yeah.  Pete and Edna Goose.  But that's why I wonder about other world events, if there's better angles and stuff.  But that shit never came forward for whatever reason.  Let me see that footage.  Boy, are they...  Wow, that's a wacky turn.  That's a wacky little...  They're tracing the trail he made.  You see the turn there?  I know this is fucking radio, and I wish we had a visual.  You see where he's like, I...  He's like, I'm coming back.  No, that move...  No, the move was, I'm going to head toward Newark Airport. 
[03:01:00]  Right.  And they went, fuck that.  I'm not going to make it.  And then that's the sharp left turn, and then he tries to straighten it out for the Hudson  River.  He goes...  Holy fuck.  It looks like he's trying to get over to Jersey.  Right.  Or maybe not, because he didn't turn from the initial takeoff.  It looks like he went to turn to come back to LaGuardia.  Right.  And said, no, fuck that, and then went to turn to go to Jersey, and then said, fuck that,  I'm going to the river.  Do you know how scary people used to be when they had to go in?  They saw the Jersey and New York on each side of them. 
[03:01:30]  Dude, that's a sharp left.  What does that feel like in a plane?  Oh, man.  We've all been in those banking turns, but that's way worse than a banking turn.  And under no power, so you're falling.  Oh, he lost both engines.  Yeah.  Wasn't there a third engine, though?  No, just two little old engines.  Oh, the bird flew into the engines.  I never realized how pretty you are, standing there looking all pretty and shit.  All pretty and shit.  You didn't do the...  I can't believe I never knew how pretty you are, just standing there looking all pretty 
[03:02:00]  and shit.  It doesn't...  It stinks.  It's like...  It's not...  It's not good?  It's...  It's terrible.  It's pretty...  It's used twice and it's...  And shit.  What is that?  Oh, Jim.  Oh, my God.  You think that one's good?  No.  It's awful.  It's not awful. 
[03:02:30]  Oh, it's terrible.  It's just...  It's just Chip realizing something about someone.  He can't believe how pretty she is.  I can't believe I never...  I can't believe I never knew how pretty you are, standing there looking all pretty and  shit.  Pretty and shit.  Like, why would he not know how pretty she is?  He just didn't realize it.  And if he had a million dollars, he'd give her half of it.  Yeah, it's part of the lyrics.  And then she's standing there looking...  Oh, let me think.  Oh, all pretty and shit.  Yeah.  It's just so lame. 
[03:03:00]  Why?  I hate it.  Do you like that or Uncle Grody more?  Oh, Uncle Grody.  It's not even just Valley Jim anymore.  He's talking about Uncle Grody.  Yeah.  By the way...  By the way.  Stephen King's last novel is about this going back and kind of changing history a little  bit, right?  With Kennedy, yeah.  I have the book and I still haven't...  I've not read that either.  I hear it's good.  Let me ask Bonnie if it's good.  Maybe he'll come on the fucking show and...  Oh, that's right.  That's right. 
[03:03:30]  He fucking hates us.  Bonnie, what's that for?  Married to a retarded guy.  Hi.  Oh.  Hi.  Oh, different Bonnie.  Do you guys want me to tell you about 1967, what happened?  It's not called 1967.  1963.  All right, I'm sorry.  No, I don't want to...  I want to read the book.  Yeah, don't fucking spurl it.  Don't give the spurl alert.  Good day, ma'am.  What are you doing?  I want to read the book.  Bonnie.  Go back and buy New York, that guy would do.  How would you buy New York, though?  For fucking...  Back then, the Indians? 
[03:04:00]  Here's a fucking...  Here's a rock with a letter on it.  I don't know.  You think they blew it?  Ah, they're the worst business people.  Yeah, here's two fucking...  Here's two squirrel pelts.  Can I have the most valuable piece of property on earth?  Fucking dopes.  Jesus Christ.  What shitty business, man.  Oh, they really were.  What was the official deal for Manhattan?  I did the official deal.  Yeah.  Was that we'll give you two eggs and a fife.  They're mesmerized by the fife.  Yeah, here, look.  You blow into it.  It makes magic noises. 
[03:04:30]  Now, beat it, stupid.  Yeah, beat it.  This is ours now.  Beat it, dummy.  Head a little further west.  We'll chase you to the ocean.  Yeah, beat it, dope.  I have to put on $30 billion worth of buildings in real estate.  You can go over there and live in that fucking upside-down triangle fucking sheepskin house.  What was the deal?  I gotta know now.  I've heard $25.  I don't know if that's true.  $25?  Yeah.  I bet $25.  Maybe I'm just thinking of Mr. Harding and Cuckoo's Nest. 
[03:05:00]  Maybe.  How much was Manhattan?  I want to think like $40-something.  It's probably worth more now.  Can we find that guy's ancestors so we can just point and laugh at him?  Oh, man.  Yeah.  Listen, my buddy, you know my buddy Joe Curry, right?  Sure.  Yeah.  His father, no, no, it was his uncle or something.  Yeah, yeah, his uncle.  One of his relatives.  Had the patent for the refrigerated boxcar.  Like the train refrigerated boxcar.  It was an old relative, obviously, like way back generations ago. 
[03:05:30]  Right.  And he traded it for like booze at a bar.  Oh, my God.  Just so he could drink.  Wow.  And poor Joe Curry is slaving away.  Exactly.  Because I'm one of his ancestors.  Yeah.  Meanwhile, thanks to that guy, we have cold beer.  Yes, exactly.  Wow.  What a dumb drunk.  I hope he killed himself.  I know, right?  It's just terrible.  My friends had a bunch of patents, too.  My mother had some, my father.  Oh, yeah?  What did they patent?  Oswald. 
[03:06:00]  Patent Oswald.  Okay.  We got the answer?  All right.  What do we got?  Jimmy, read that.  I can't read.  Paul Minute.  Well, I can read, but I can't read that.  Paul Minute is not mentioned explicitly here.  Paulie's quick.  It's not mentioned explicitly here.  Acquired Manhattan in 1626 from Native American Lenape?  Lenape? 
[03:06:30]  No, no, no.  It's Chief Dumbella.  Whatever those people are called.  In exchange for trade goods worth 60 guilders.  Nice.  Often said to be worth 24 U.S. dollars.  Though by comparing the price of bread and other goods, it actually amounts to around $1,000 in modern currency.  Do you think you need to make themselves feel better in that tribe?  Well, you know, it's actually a thousand.  It's a grand.  You know, people say 25 bucks, but it was a thousand.  Yeah. 
[03:07:00]  Yeah.  Imagine if we had Manhattan, how much that would suck owning this.  Worst deal in history.  Terrible.  Some Indians got pissed off or something, I guess.  Victoria's Secret was doing one of their fashion shows.  Oh, yeah.  And a hot fucking model is wearing an Indian headdress thing.  A big, like, ceremonial colorful feathers.  It was real long and everything.  It looked cool.  It looked great.  And then, we don't like that.  And they discontinued using it. 
[03:07:30]  That's a load of shit.  Why is that a big problem?  Only they can wear it?  Well, they kind of feel, I mean, just their answer would be that they feel they're being, like, that you wouldn't wear a Muslim headdress.  They feel that that's their religion.  Like, it's become kind of cartoon, but that's their religion.  You think?  I mean, I know I've heard them say it.  That's why I...  Oh, they've said that.  Yeah, that's why...  The only reason I agree with them is because they made a reasonable explanation when I heard them talk about it.  Indians are very fucking sensitive.  Holy shit. 
[03:08:00]  Yeah, what the fuck?  I know.  Jesus, can't you just take a good raping and pillaging and having smallpox hats given to you?  Jesus Christ, there's a Yankees hat with smallpox on it.  Took Manhattan for 25 bucks.  All they said is, hey, could you not wear our religious garb and strip shows?  And we're like, oh, fuck yourselves.  And then we get mad at them for lending us payday loans at astronomical interest rates.  Right, at crazy interest rates.  How come they get the casinos?  I don't know, because they had everything at one point.  Oh, when there was nothing here.  Yes.  Boy, did we show them how it's done. 
[03:08:30]  Exactly.  I don't mind.  They're getting us back.  Yeah.  See them fucking make a skyscraper stacking up those stupid teepees.  They'd get fucking two floors and it would tip over.  Yeah.  They can't even put the second floor on a teepee.  No, you have to turn them upside down.  Yeah.  And so I'm still upside down.  That's stupid.  I told you, when I went to Camp Mason, and it was over the summer, but we'd had a Halloween  party and I didn't have an outfit, so I went as Backwards Man and I put my clothes on backwards.  Oh, the Backwards Man.  Backwards Man.  Did you do that for us?  No, it was too good in the costume. 
[03:09:00]  You were Backwards Man?  No, do it for us, though.  I'll do it when I come back.  What about the hair?  I just put a hat on.  Oh.  I was back.  Yeah, but you could draw a face on the back of your head.  You're ripping off Tom Green.  No, this was before Tom Green did it.  Oh, you ripped off Tom Green.  No, sir.  He ripped you off.  He ripped me off.  I was 13.  He's the Backwards Man.  I like Tom Green.  I love Tom Green.  He's so fucking weird.  He's the Backwards Man.  He's so fucking weird, man.  This movie takes so much heat.  It's so silly, stupid.  You can't not laugh at it.  It's fucking stupid. 
[03:09:30]  All right, Jimmy.  Addison Improv, right?  Yeah.  Tonight?  Tonight, tomorrow, Saturday.  Good.  Fuck.  I wish I could go.  Yeah, we went to Dallas.  What was that, 2003?  I went a couple times.  Dallas was a cool little city.  I'm going to see Tyson when I'm down there.  He's inviting me to the Cowboys game Sunday.  Tyson doesn't live down there.  I guess he's going to be there for something.  Oh, nice.  But I can't go to the Cowboy game because I have to fly home.  I would love to go to Texas Stadium.  Why don't you stay for a little while? 
[03:10:00]  Have you ever been to Texas Stadium?  No.  That's your opportunity.  I can't miss it.  When does Jim Norton enjoy himself?  Jim Norton doesn't enjoy himself.  Jim Norton enjoys himself.  I'll tell you the moment Jim Norton enjoys himself.  Yeah, go ahead.  When those fingers go from behind, past the thighs, into the asshole.  You really like that?  Here's how it looks like a massage.  Picture two fingers circling the event horizon of a black hole.  How fast they get sucked in when they pass it.  Does your ass actually suck things into it like that?  Nothing escapes my asshole, including Lee press on nails and lights. 
[03:10:30]  And that's better than seeing Texas Stadium?  It's better than fucking owning Texas Stadium.  Feeling those fingers plummet.  Fair enough.  Addison Improv for Jim Norton.  Go see him, motherfuckers.  Yeah, man.  There's a few tickets available, right?  Yeah.  So you still have a chance to see Jimmy?  Yeah.  Tonight, Friday, and Saturday.  Fucking Jets.  Ah, Christ, why are they on the TV?  Tell her getting there. 
[03:11:00]  Rex Ryan standing by Sanchez.  Jets players coming out saying that Tebow stinks.  Tebow.  The whole team is in a bad spot.  Then why would you put him on the team?  Oh, that's because the owner wanted him.  Woody wanted him.  Woody Johnson.  Rex Ryan never wanted Tim Tebow.  It's pretty obvious now.  All right, we'll take you out with this.  Fuck it.  Thanksgiving.  Thanksgiving.  Have a good time.  Oh, oh, oh.  It's Thanksgiving.  We, we, we. 
[03:11:30]  Oh.  We'll be eating.  We, we, we.  She's going to make we, we.  The turkey.  Potatoes.  All right.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony.  On Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  Hey, hey, hey.  And now, the Opie and Anthony Show continues. 
[03:12:00]  This is After ONA Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  Yeah, it is.  And I got to tell you this.  First things first.  You should know this by now.  But if you don't.  If you ask any woman what gift was the best gift she ever got, without hesitation.  She never even has to think about it.  It's always her engagement ring.  Even if she's never been proposed to.  It's the theory that one day she will get an engagement ring.  That's the one thing I did right.  I gave Jess a very nice engagement ring before we were married. 
[03:12:30]  That's why she said yes.  It's important.  It's not just a ring.  It's not just a sign of affection.  It's everything.  Every time this chick washes her hands.  Every time someone at the store hands her chains.  You're going to get credit for it.  Every time she shows her friends.  You're going to get credit for it.  You get credit for that ring every day.  So it's got to be perfect.  And Steven Singer understands that.  And Steven Singer, they, jewelers.  They have the perfect system to make sure you get the perfect ring.  Steven knows how important it is.  It's painless.

Go to Steven Singer at the other corner of 8th and Walnut, on the phone at 1-888-I-Hate-Steven-Singer, 
[03:13:30]  or online at IHateStevenSinger.com.  Just one of those organic ways we start after Opie and Anthony Live sometimes, Jesse May Peluso.  Was that Walnut?  Did you just say?  On the other corner of 8th and Walnut.  The other corner.  You know, you go to Philly, and there's one corner of 8th and Walnut.  He's on the other corner.  Okay, so you shouldn't be able to miss it.  No, that's exactly right.  It should be pretty apparent where he is.  Jesse May Peluso is here.  We also, you know what we're doing today?  I don't.  I have this copy of Call, you know Call of Duty. 
[03:14:00]  Of course.  It's the biggest game ever.  It changes many lonely men's lives.  Yeah.  Some men go to women.  Some men go to Call of Duty Black Ops.  But I have a copy of Call of Duty Black Ops 2.  And this is the hardened edition.  I don't know what that, that sounds like a medical condition.  I have no idea what that means.  Yeah.  It's hardened?  It's hardened.  It's like, if you go and just buy the regular edition, it's a little frilly, a little like,  oh, look at my Call of Duty.  This is like, yeah, I'm a man. 
[03:14:30]  Because it comes with all kinds of like, nuke, nuke, yeah, it comes with a cape.  Yeah, it does.  It comes with a pair of boots that are red.  And a whole bunch of other extras that are mainly for the game.  I may keep the cape, so I don't know if you'll get that.  But there's bonus content on it for the gameplay.  There is.  Where you can play the game, but you're shooting at zombies.  What?  Because everyone likes zombies.  Look at him nerding out in the corner.  I know.  E-Rock, you better be saving this for your show.  Yeah, I guess there, yeah.  That, uh, bonus in-game content, Nuketown Zombies and Nuketown 2025. 
[03:15:00]  So you get to be the army, and you get to go and start shooting zombies.  Is that right, Eric?  Yeah.  I think we got a couple of these, uh, hardened editions to give away.  So...  Which platform?  No, PlayStation 3.  The platform is, thank you, it's not Xbox, it's PlayStation.  Atari.  Yeah, it's Nintendo, not, it's the original.  It's a flip book.  We had one for N64, but I'm keeping it.  Um, so call in, but, you know,  have something real good, because I'm gonna go through some, I'm not just, if you're 
[03:15:30]  just like, oh, I want the game, I'm gonna go, go to GameStop then.  Like, I'm not, you know, have something good for me.  Like a what did you learn, or something.  At least you can impress my guest, Jessie Mae Peluso.  How have you been doing?  I've been good.  Yeah?  Yeah.  You just got back, you look all tan.  I know, I have a, skin cancer is really what it is.  I'm sorry I brought it up then, I didn't realize.  It's like fermented patches of melanoma, that's all it is.  Well, it looks great.  Thanks.  I mean, you wear it well.  Is the takeaway.  Yeah, it was in the, uh, DR. 
[03:16:00]  Dominican Republic?  For all those white people, it's the Dominican Republic, not the doctor's office.  Yeah, I was at the doctor, well, that's where he diagnosed me.  My mom's like, what happened?  Did you hurt yourself, hon?  We were there for a week.  Your mom's from Syracuse.  Yeah.  She doesn't understand that people's skin color changes sometimes, because the sun doesn't  come out there.  Yeah, on purpose.  Uh, what were you doing in Dominican Republic, vacationing?  I was doing a little vacation, doing a little joke telling.  Love it.  Yeah.  Do they get, where, at the resort?  Yeah.  Oh, okay, because I was going to say, I wouldn't think that, like, the locals would have any 
[03:16:30]  idea what you were talking about.  I wouldn't, I wouldn't be back here.  I would, I would still be there, probably shucking coconuts.  Yeah, they would kidnap you.  Have you gone overseas for comedy before?  I've gone to Norway.  Norway?  Oslo.  Well, you probably, you could fit in in Norway.  I'd fit right in there, yeah.  Is there, so, does Norway understand, like, because there'd be cultural differences.  Yeah, there's a lot of cultural difference, but they're so much smarter than Americans,  so they just almost understand your jokes before you're done telling them.  Right, like, they know exactly where you're going. 
[03:17:00]  So they're laughing at your setup, like, I know where she's going to go, it's going  to be great.  Yeah.  It's going to be hilarious.  Sam, we had, uh, I'm sorry, we had Bill Burr on a while ago.  He was talking exactly what you were saying about going over there.  They love American comedians.  They love it.  And it's weird because, um, like, here people laugh after jokes, there they clap.  Really?  It's a weird adjustment.  Yeah, they clap after.  They don't laugh.  They, it's more of a clapping than laughter thing.  So it's a weird adjustment as far as your timing goes.  I applaud your attempted humor.  Yeah.  Very good, American. 
[03:17:30]  Very good.  It sounds so condescending.  Keep dancing.  Why are you applauding?  Yeah.  I'm so confused.  I haven't had this many applause breaks before.  And then at the end, they give you, like, pats on the head and everything.  Well done.  Da, da, da.  Um, we're very excited here.  I don't know if you know this because, you know, you rock?  Yeah.  He's the big guy in the other room.  Yeah, the big guy, the Oz over here.  What?  That's not necessary.  We've talked about this.  I just think descriptives are so important.  Um, he's got a big, he's doing a show on the channel. 
[03:18:00]  Okay.  It's his debut show.  Oh, no.  It's called Bageling with the Sex.  Because his nickname is Sex Bagel.  Why is it Sex Bagel?  What happened?  Good question.  You're wrong.  Do you, like, eat carbs while it's going down?  No.  It was a name from long, long ago.  That's not.  That's all we're getting?  That's not an explanation.  I'm not retelling that story.  That's so elusive.  What's the story?  Jesse May Peluso and a lot of listeners don't know what the story is.  It was the name I used in college radio and kept it going into regular radio. 
[03:18:30]  Why'd you use it in college radio?  I'm not going into the whole thing.  Come on.  Now everybody wants to know.  The story sucks.  It has nothing to do with actually.  No, it doesn't.  Actually, the story's pretty good.  It's not.  It's pretty good.  I'm not doing it.  If you know it so well, you tell it then.  Sam, you're a good storyteller.  Well, I.  Be the voice.  I think, what, did you give sex advice on your show?  I was filling in on somebody else's show.  To do what?  Because the main host wasn't there.  So I was running the board while the other host was talking and they were doing some dumb 
[03:19:00]  sex advice shit.  And they asked me a question and I gave my answer.  And the guy thought he was going to be funny because my last name rhymes with bagel.  So he was going to go like he was going to be taking a shot at me.  He wanted to go sex advice from the bagel real sarcastically, but he said advice from  the sex bagel and it just sounded so stupid.  It's a terrible story.  The sex bagel.  You've got to come up with a good graphic for that.  You know what the problem with the story is?  It's like the name is so ridiculous that you're like, that couldn't possibly be the story  that matches that name. 
[03:19:30]  Yeah, you're like, okay, that is a story.  I do like, though, that within one question I was able to get him to tell the story.  What was it?  Refresh my memory.  Then he just tells the story.  You didn't have to pull his bagel too hard.  No.  Oh.  See, that's good.  Casey in Los Angeles.  Hey, what's going on, ladies and gentlemen?  How are you?  There's one lady.  Thank you for considering me.  Jesse May Peluso and Sal are both here.  So two ladies.  Oh, that was rude.  Actually, he answered the phone for me.  He was super nice.  I felt like he did a great job.  And look at my phone call. 
[03:20:00]  I made it all the way to the air.  No, that would be intern Anthony.  No, I screened that one, Eric.  He's taking credit.  Good, good.  Good, Sal.  Stick up for yourself.  Yeah, fuck you.  Sex.  So what's up, Casey?  Yeah, I just wanted to.  There was this girl that I dated in high school.  Anyway, she called me kind of out of the blue.  It was ten years later.  And she got fucking fat, right?  Or she got very heavy.  But she still has huge breasts.  She came over last night.  That tends to happen with a lot of fat people.  Eric, you know what I mean?  Yeah, it does.  I'm just asking, Eric. 
[03:20:30]  I'm asking if you know what I mean.  I'm not saying that it's you.  He's not listening.  I don't care.  He's talking to somebody else.  Go on, Casey.  I'm honestly sorry for the content here at Iraq.  I didn't mean to do that to you this morning.  He's not listening to you.  He's terrible at producing this show.  He's really bad at it.  Go on.  So she came over last night, and I don't know what it was, but she literally, she sucked  my dick like a fucking, like a hoover.  Like, she couldn't get enough sperm out of her.  You went from A to Z very quickly, Casey. 
[03:21:00]  Well, yeah, no, but I'm just trying to get to the point.  I mean, I know you have a show to do and everything, so I want to, you know, right?  Yeah.  And then, and then, and then she, when she left, when she left, she said thank you to  me.  It was like, it was as though, it was as though.  She just blew you and then said thank you?  I feel like you made this whole story up.  Do you think it's a lie, Jessie Mae?  No, I swear to fucking God.  You're very intense.  Did you say like a hoover?  That's like such a 1980s reference.  Who has a hoover vacuum anymore?  Nobody has a hoover.  It's a Dyson now. 
[03:21:30]  That's right.  My Dyson doesn't even, well, actually, yeah.  Doesn't Dyson make chicken?  Delicious chicken out of a hoover.  She blew me like a Dyson.  You mean like a chicken?  Yes.  Have you ever gotten blown by a chicken?  No, no, I haven't.  Was that question directed towards me?  I'm gonna, it didn't work.  It didn't work, did it?  Christ.  It didn't work.  He wanted to do like a fun story.  Maybe I would give him the video game.  And look, you gotta get through.  Jessie Mae Peluso.  I'm so sorry.  I didn't mean to shoot you down.  Look, somebody's gotta do it. 
[03:22:00]  He said Hoover.  Let's see.  That was my nickname when I was seven.  It was, what?  Yeah, because it was so awesome at softball.  The ball's gonna get by me.  He called me the Hoover.  Oh, I thought you just had a lot of adult friends at seven.  Justin.  Hey, what's going on, Sam?  What's up?  First of all, I'd just like to say,  I appreciate the after show.  The quality of guests that you guys get on this show,  it's way better than anything Opie and Anthony has ever gotten.  You know, sitting right next to you is one of the most beautiful women I've ever seen, personally. 
[03:22:30]  Okay, Roland is making motions like you're jerking everybody off in the room to try to get a video game.  Well, that's part of it.  That's part of it.  But you don't mind, Jessie Mae.  No, but he hasn't seen me this early in the morning, so he might retract that comment.  With skin cancer.  I don't even get to listen to ONA.  I get in my car just in time to listen to Sam.  Okay, all right, all right.  Is that it?  What else do you want?  All right, I'm hanging out by you.  That's bullshit.  He's an asshole.  It must be a story. 
[03:23:00]  This is a big prize, so this better be a good call.  I mean, it's sold out.  Children spent hours and days in blood, sweat, and tears to make this video game.  That's right.  So somebody better have a damn good story.  They had to shoot children to get the accuracy, the bullet time and all that stuff.  Where was it made?  Does it say where it was made?  Let me find out.  That wasn't made in America.  China.  The actual fabrication of that box.  The box itself, I would say Taiwan.  Yeah, definitely like Taiwan.  It looks like a Taiwanese box.  So how much do you love a Taiwanese child?  Your story better reflect that.  That's exactly right. 
[03:23:30]  Sal?  Yeah?  You're going to be the executive producer on Bageling with the Sex.  Jesse May, you're going to be tuning into that, right?  Hell yeah.  I mean, it sounds too good.  I'm going to be tuning in and cream cheesing in at the same time.  Nice.  That's something you could do while you're bageling with the sex.  Bageling.  Bageling.  Yeah.  It's an action word.  An action word.  I like that.  Mm-hmm.  Sal, how is everything going along?  Are you guys going to be ready?  Because Eric's not going to be here tomorrow.  Yeah.  So that means that the last big brainstorm sesh before Eric's big show with his executive 
[03:24:00]  producer, Sal, has to go down today.  But didn't he just say, fuck you, sex, like a few minutes ago?  He did.  He did say, fuck you, sex.  And you're the second producer of the show.  Yeah.  It's very tension.  Yes, yes.  That could make for a good show.  As Roland did just say, it's very tension.  Very good.  It's very tension.  It's very tension in here.  You could cut the tents with a knife.  I've been asking Eric almost on a daily basis, do you want to have a meeting?  Just like, you know, between the two of us. 
[03:24:30]  Sure.  And talk things over.  And Eric just does not give a shit at all.  He won't talk to you about it?  Well, it's not that he won't talk to me, but he's just being very, very indirect.  Like, he has a special guest.  And Roland's dying to find out who the fuck this guest is.  But Eric will not tell anybody.  He's not telling you?  No.  He won't.  You think it's somebody, like, really good, or, like...  Probably not.  I think he's just trying to build it up a little bit.  I mean, you heard the build-up to the sex bagel story.  Yeah, so...  A bit of a letdown at the end, wasn't it?  Yeah, it's like an M. Night Shyamalan movie. 
[03:25:00]  That's right.  Except for that one with the dead kid.  Or dead Bruce Willis.  Yeah, that was a good one.  Whichever one of them was dead.  That one was good.  That was good.  Rest of them, though.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Very Nagel-ish ending.  How come you're not talking to your executive producer, E-Rock?  I talk to him, but I just tell him what he needs to know.  You won't tell him who the secret guest is?  No.  I kind of like that.  You're just...  I didn't even bring it up on the air.  Right.  I never mentioned the secret guest on the air.  You did.  You brought up there was a guest that might come in.  You said it the other day.  But I never said a secret guest or anything.  Do you have a secret guest? 
[03:25:30]  I have somebody coming in.  Is it a good guest?  Is it a secret guest worth people wondering, saying,  Oh, I wonder who the secret guest is?  I would think so, yes.  It is!  They're coming in.  Yes.  Am I going to be excited?  Um, you might.  I don't know, actually.  Is Jessie Mae Peluso going to be excited?  Only if it's John Stamos or the other dude from True Blood.  Then, no, she will not be excited.  Then I'm out.  At least she did narrow it down for you, though.  You didn't have to guess.  And we're working on a phone or two, so.  You only got one hour.  Yeah.  Good for you. 
[03:26:00]  I love it.  Is this a TV star who's coming in?  Um, what's your name?  I guess, yeah, I guess in some...  So it's a porn star.  In some small degree, yeah.  Is it a pornography star?  No, no, no, no.  Gay pornography?  No.  Um, so it's a movie star, then?  No.  Musician?  No.  What?  I guessed someone yesterday, and I thought I was right.  Who'd you guess?  Laszlo.  You guessed Laszlo?  No.  If it's Laszlo, look.  Look, I told him I would love to have Laszlo on, but I did not ask Laszlo. 
[03:26:30]  It's not Laszlo.  Laszlo, also, he's a good guest.  He's not a great secret surprise guest.  Well, I was talking about the whole gaming element of the show, as well.  So I thought Laszlo would be coming in.  And that wasn't the secret, either.  That, I said, I have a guy coming in who does video game reviews, and we have stuff to give  away.  Can I tell you, can I give you advice?  Mm-hmm.  You don't want to talk about Call of Duty on your show.  Anthony just spent an hour talking about Call of Duty today and yesterday.  Different audience.  No, it's not.  It's the exact same audience.  Nope.  It is 100% the same audience. 
[03:27:00]  Nope.  But Eric and I will have one copy each giveaway.  That's exciting.  So if you don't win today's Call of Duty, there'll be one given away on...  Roland's doing a show, too.  Oh, nice!  It's called Roland's Food Court.  He said he's forced to.  He was forced to.  He just looked at me with sad eyes.  He's like, I'm forced to.  Roland's Food Court is leading into bailing with the sex.  There's a lot of food innuendos going on.  Food Court?  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah.  He's going to judge food.  Okay.  From where?  And he has got guests coming in, too.  Yeah.  Yeah, but I want to...  Because I'll be able to talk to Roland about it tomorrow. 
[03:27:30]  You won't be in tomorrow.  Mm-hmm.  So you're really going to talk about Call of Duty?  For a little bit.  I don't think it's a great idea.  And some other stuff that's come out.  I'm not going to tell you what to do.  But I would say, if you want to talk about people who like you that don't get...  You know what I mean?  If you want to talk to people who like you and you want to talk about something that's  not talked about on the main show, you should talk about the wrestling game.  It's on the list, too.  Good.  Keep that list growing.  Now it's new to you, Sal. 
[03:28:00]  Sorry, he doesn't want to fucking tell me anything.  So you're not using Sal.  You're really...  You can't say I haven't come to you and asked you multiple times to go over stuff.  I'm being very proactive.  You need to calm down because no one here...  Well, maybe Sam has, but I have not attacked you once on all this.  So relax.  No, I'm just saying I'm being very proactive and trying to do a good job.  You're very tense in here.  You are.  Yeah, you're making...  There's very tension in here.  Have a cupcake.  Joel McHale's going to call in to see what his favorite restaurant is while he's treating  the community on my show.  Joel McHale is going to call into your show?  Yeah, I got some of the listeners calling in. 
[03:28:30]  No, no, no.  Joel McHale is calling into the food court with Roland on Saturday?  Yeah, it's confirmed.  Yeah, I'm Burk Reicher, and then a couple other A-listers may be peppered throughout.  Wait, you can't...  You know what?  He's got credibility.  There'll be food samples, right?  Wait, there'll be food samples.  Does Joel McHale beat your guest, Eric?  Oh, yeah.  And then there's another late-night talk show host, one or two in May.  Well, there's not that many of them.  Is it Craig Ferguson?  No.  Is it Jimmy Kimmel?  Yeah, what are you going to do?  Oh, Jesus Christ. 
[03:29:00]  Have you got Jimmy Kimmel to call in your show?  O&A can't get Jimmy Kimmel.  No.  You tweeted Fallon yesterday.  Well, I know, but I said there's a couple.  Oh.  Oh, my God.  I can't wait to hear what you do.  I can't wait to hear what you do.  I just heard his surprise guest, and I got a little too excited.  You're like you got a one-up.  I would love nothing more if Roland's show just blows mine away, where he's just constantly  guest, guest, guest, guest, guest.  Are you feeling?  It's going to be.  Because Roland's not going to get a chance to talk.  I know.  And that's how you're booking it, right, Roland?  Without you talking?  And the good part is, Burt Kreischer, in honor of the show, is they call in drunk. 
[03:29:30]  Are you going to be drunk?  Oh, yeah.  Perfect.  What time is the show going to be on?  Five.  Oh, that's fine.  Five Eastern.  Even if it were now, I wouldn't judge at all.  What's great about five is a.m. or p.m.  You're fine.  I mean, you can be drunk at either of those two times.  It's a tail end of something.  So, Eric, are you confident about your show?  Yeah, I'm confident.  You are?  Yeah.  You're feeling good?  Mm-hmm.  And you're EP-ing this thing by yourself.  You're not giving Sal anything.  No, Sal's going to run the board. 
[03:30:00]  But that's not an EP job.  That would be board operator.  I'm finding things for him to do.  Really?  Because whenever you feel like letting me know, that'd be great, Eric.  Sal, you're not.  I haven't done any shit.  And by the way, Eric.  Hey, can I ask Eric a question?  During my show, can Sal give me drinks?  The what?  During my show, can Sal give me drinks?  Of course.  Oh, thank you, though.  But you're taking executive responsibilities away from Sal and taking them on yourself.  No, I'm not taking any executive responsibilities away from him since I haven't given him any yet.  No, but I mean, okay, you're not giving him any.  You're keeping them. 
[03:30:30]  Not all of them.  He'll have some stuff to do.  He'll talk today.  But most of them.  Yeah, I had to wait.  Like two days before the show, you want to talk.  I had to wait on a couple of things.  I told you that.  All creative decisions are yours, not Sal's.  Yes.  It's probably smart.  All eyes on me.  It's probably smart.  Some of this thing fucking tanks, I could be like, okay, Eric.  Yep.  All on me, too.  I love it.  E-Rock's going sink or swim on this one.  And then Julia from All Nations can come and make drinks throughout the whole show.  Oh, yeah.  That'll make it much.  He's got a bartender.  Yeah.  He's got food coming.  Well, I was just thinking, Joel McHale, what could be next? 
[03:31:00]  Julia from SiriusXMU, of course.  Make drinks.  The A-listers keep coming.  I know.  You may have.  That's not nice.  Well, I'm just saying, you may want to introduce Julia before you introduce Jimmy Kimmel.  Well, there's one big A-lister.  Yeah, exactly.  If he get away from doing his press from his movie in New York, he'll come by.  Who?  He can't say.  He can't give it away.  I'm not.  It's a secret surprise guest.  Oh, I didn't know that.  Because it's probably not going to happen.  Well, no.  He's going to try to do it.  Stop by, though, during his press tour.  Who's shooting a movie in New York? 
[03:31:30]  No, no.  He's not shooting a movie.  He's doing press in New York.  Oh.  He's a major A-lister, though.  Wow.  Is it John Stamos or that guy from True Blood?  Bigger than those two.  Yeah, he said major A-lister.  Listen, in my mind, those are A-listers.  A-listers.  Russell Crowe?  It's been quite some time since John Stamos fit that mold.  He's placed drums for the fake Beach Boys now, for God's sake.  He's not exactly setting the world on fire.  Listen, you know what?  Are you playing drums for anybody, Sam?  Primetime Roberts?  Not at the moment.  Not as we speak, no. 
[03:32:00]  I'm very excited about this weekend.  Anything else?  Because I need Sal to come in here.  Sal?  You good?  Yeah, my...  Your assistant?  He got that backwards.  Yeah, I need to get to my assistant.  He can go assist you, Eric.  Okay.  I don't need Sal in here.  Nobody does.  Sal's cute, though.  You think so?  Yeah, he's adorable.  You hear that?  He's got terrible work ethic.  I don't know if that bothers you or not.  That's fine.  Terrible.  I mean, he might be the worst employee we've ever had here.  And that's been documented.  Every task that he's attempted here on the show... 
[03:32:30]  Documented.  ...failed.  And it's been brought up on the air every time.  Mike in Staten Island.  Yo.  What up?  What up?  What up?  Yo, I heard Jimmy's got man rapping skills.  Pretty and shit.  Yo, pretty and shit.  Pretty and shit?  I don't think those are the right words.  That's the right word.  I can't give you the game.  You didn't even give him a second to tell the story.  No, no, I can't give you the game.  It's like you have two seconds to make this shit work. 
[03:33:00]  Exactly.  It's like that show.  Make me laugh.  Ivan.  Hey there, I learned today that Opie needs to train his family how to operate a camera  a little faster.  I mean, he gets all his good images on New York City and he can't train his family?  He needs to start training his little kid, too.  Okay.  Roland says no.  He's an asshole.  Does he know he's on the phone?  Or did we just catch him mid-sentence?  He's just talking to somebody.  You know, the phone picks up.  You're like, you know what? 
[03:33:30]  Anyways, Sally said.  Can I say this?  After that phone call, maybe we'll call you, Ivan the Terrible.  Oh, no, you didn't.  Hey, E-Rock.  A little historical humor.  He was trying to sneak in an E-Rock joke because that's the cheap way to get over.  What's it going to happen?  What's it going to happen?  He caught him off.  How about this one?  Brian.  Hey, what's up?  Not too much, Brian.  Why don't you tell me?  Well, absolutely nothing, but I have a double, what did you learn today?  That's pretty good. 
[03:34:00]  I learned that Jimmy was balls deep in his ex-girlfriend's asshole while Sully was trying to land the airplane.  Did you know that about Jim Norton?  What?  He's trying to land an airplane?  No, no, Sully, the guy who landed the plane in the Hudson, Jim was balls deep in his girlfriend's asshole.  Is that right you said, Brian?  Yes, sir.  Right.  It's so early for that image right now.  And what's the second thing that you learned?  That Anthony actually went to high school in 1937. 
[03:34:30]  Roland?  No.  No?  Sorry, buddy.  It didn't go over.  It didn't go over.  It bored me when you said hello.  Anthony in California.  I learned that E-Rox is bad as a dinosaur, dinosaur.  I learned you're not going to get the game.  Who's going to get the game then?  What do they have to do?  What are these people saying?  I feel like I'm tripped out right now.  What are they saying?  I don't have the disc with me right now.  There's a jingle.  We had a jingle contest. 
[03:35:00]  Oh, that's right, from before.  Right, but we did a special all E-Rox jingles today because we ended up with literally 35 different E-Rox jingles.  Oh, my God.  They were all very mean, but we gave two different people $500 for the best E-Rox jingles.  So he was singing one of them.  Okay.  One of them, you know.  Because he's doing it for the cheap laugh, though.  Okay.  Well, I can't, you know.  We can't have that.  I want to talk to Jesse May Peluso.  I can't go to calls all day.  Take another one.  All right, Mike.  Hey, what's up, Sam?  Um, I think that, um, E-Rox has been working on a Lego version of John Samos as his special guest for the last few months. 
[03:35:30]  Maybe.  I will still dry hump that.  A Lego John Samos?  E-Rox, make sure you put whatever glue you put on Legos to keep them together because Jesse May will start just chipping bricks off.  Chipping away like I've got teeth in my veg.  I want to loop up those Legos, too.  They can be pointy with those edges.  She's experienced.  I know.  I know all about Legos. 
[03:36:00]  Don't you worry.  I also have a lifted jawline, Sam.  Yeah, what's that?  Wow, what's that?  Yeah.  Yeah?  I learned that Jimmy's asshole is like a black hole, and it's similar to a vortex that just sucks everything into it.  That's true.  Jim did mention that today.  He said when there's a masseuse over, once you get above the thigh, his asshole is like a black hole just sucking fingers into it.  Roland, I think, I think.  That's a good one.  Mike, where are you from, Mike?  That one made me gut laugh.  I'm representing Queens, baby.  Queens! 
[03:36:30]  Well, guess what?  That's where we're sending this hardened edition copy of Call of Duty Black Ops 2 for PlayStation 3.  Congratulations, Mike.  Yeah.  Oh, hell yeah.  Oh, hell yeah.  Thanks a lot.  I really appreciate it.  You got it.  I'm looking for Anthony on there.  Good for, well, you won't be, he's on Xbox, so you won't be able to play with him.  But, maybe you'll see, maybe you'll see me on there, not Sam.  All right, not Sam.  I'm looking out for you.  And I'd greatly appreciate it.  All right, buddy.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Don't hang up.  All right.  If you hang up that phone, we won't know where to send it. 
[03:37:00]  We'll just be like, Mike Queens.  Put it on an envelope.  Send it.  Yeah.  So, hang on.  I am on hold.  All right.  He's holding on the line.  I'm glad you're here today, Jesse May Peluso.  Are you?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Very glad.  Because, this is what I've been meaning to talk to you about.  We had, Guy, Guy Fieri was in here.  Oh, yeah.  He was in here on Monday or Tuesday?  He was?  Yeah, he actually came in on my show.  I'm surprised.  He was only in here for like 10 minutes.  I let him, I did him a favor.  He was promoting some charity.  He's apologized to me so many times because I have such a rivalry with him. 
[03:37:30]  Because he poured alcohol into my mouth without my knowledge.  And I think that's very disrespectful.  What are you laughing at?  That's disrespectful.  That is so disrespectful.  That happened to me a lot in the DR this past week.  Yeah, but that wasn't without your permission.  Okay, it's true.  It's true, but just in general.  When you're laying down on a bar with your mouth open, stuff's going to get poured into it.  A lot of different things.  Who knows what it is?  You just, you try to judge from the aftertaste and then go forward.  But, yeah, he was in here.  And, uh, the next day, the big New York Times review came out on his restaurant. 
[03:38:00]  Have you seen it?  No.  It's gone viral.  Like, this is the only restaurant review to have ever gone viral.  Like, the internet loves it.  It's all, it's like Gawker and every website posted this review.  I think he did a sedation today.  Because they killed him.  Oh.  Like, just obliterated him.  It's the worst, it is the worst restaurant review you've ever read.  Are you serious?  The worst.  I was getting, like, I guess people, we talked about it on O&A yesterday. 
[03:38:30]  And I guess people didn't hear that part of the show.  Because, like, my Twitter was blowing up with people who know of my previous rivalry with Guy Fieri.  Yeah.  And it was just going crazy.  Everybody was sending me links to this review.  Like, you gotta be happy today.  Link to the review.  I mean.  Why do you have such a rivalry with him?  Because he poured alcohol into my mouth without my knowledge.  I mean, he said you want some water.  And I said yes.  Are you serious?  And it was vodka.  Wait, shut up.  Where was this?  In his studio. 
[03:39:00]  Here.  Where did he get the vodka?  It was cooking vodka.  But it was vodka.  Cooking vodka?  There's a different kind of vodka?  I don't know.  That's what a drunk says.  That's a cooking vodka.  This is just cooking vodka.  That's cooking vodka.  It's nothing.  No.  He was using it to, I guess, cook whatever he was cooking.  His hair.  Yeah.  To stay straight.  Exactly.  Horrible hair.  It's terrible, isn't it?  Yeah.  Well, he's gotta have his hair like that.  He's gonna wear his sunglasses on the back of his head.  I can't deal.  But yeah.  Like, they said, like, his chicken tenders tasted like badly battered air. 
[03:39:30]  Oh, jeez.  Like, they said it was...  You've eaten at the restaurant before, Roland.  You have?  I liked it.  Stop it, Roland.  You lied.  It's a themed restaurant.  That's what...  Like, what themed?  American food.  Yeah.  Horrible food.  American food.  Well, then, you know what?  American food.  If it's real American food, then maybe he got it right.  Yeah.  I mean, it's Applebee's, is it not?  It's a step up from Applebee's.  Is it?  So, like, Ruby Tuesdays.  Ruby Tuesdays are little bitches.  Why do you say that? 
[03:40:00]  What's your rivalry with Ruby Tuesdays?  I love Ruby Tuesdays.  I do, too.  Salabar gets me every time.  But, like, the Ruby Tuesdays is not big here.  Right.  Like, when I lived in Syracuse when I was going to school, I was always in Ruby Tuesdays.  It's where celebrities go.  I used to go to Ruby Tuesdays with Scorch.  We used to just kill it on Rock 105, the dog.  Everybody knows Scorch.  Oh, what was it?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  This was Scorch's favorite line.  And he used it on every Ruby Tuesdays waitress that would ask him.  Because he has this distinct voice.  Hey, Scorch.  Naked militia.  Sir, you do your boo-boo-boo. 
[03:40:30]  That's what he sounded like.  And he always sounded like that.  Either that was his voice or he just kept the voice going off the air.  Because, like, he'd sit down at Ruby Tuesdays and he'd be like,  Hey, I think we'd have a Caesar salad.  Bring me a beer.  And then bring me a burger with fries.  And the waitress would be like, Oh, okay.  And I guess she would recognize his voice because then she would come back.  And she'd be like, Hey, I was just curious.  Are you on the radio?  I've heard so many people say, Are you on the radio?  And he loves it.  Because without fail, anytime that question is asked of him, he responds, No, I'm sitting right in front of you. 
[03:41:00]  Oh, God.  Every time.  Every time.  And me and the other guy who worked with, Pauly, would just look at each other.  Like, I'd be cracking up because of how horrible it was.  Oh, God, so bad.  And he would be so embarrassed.  Like, You did it again?  And the waitress would be like, Huh?  No, I meant like.  Just like, yeah.  Like, do you do a radio show then, I guess?  Like, nobody ever was like, Ha ha, you got me.  No, I'm sitting right in front of you.  It's like something somebody's drunk uncle says at Christmas every year.  And they're laughing and they're slapping you on the leg. 
[03:41:30]  You're like, Don't touch me there.  It's uncomfortable.  But yeah, yeah, that's where Ruby Tuesdays is popular.  It's not around New York.  But Guy Fieri is a step above Applebee's, you think?  Yeah, 100%.  Maybe like a baby step.  I don't know if it's a full, like.  Like, it's a full leap.  Is it?  Yeah.  I've never eaten there.  Yeah.  Where is it?  It's in Times Square.  I mean.  It's between 7th and 8th.  Yeah.  If you could go to Red Lobster or his place, would you go to his place over at Red Lobster? 
[03:42:00]  Anthony Bourdain, who's another chef, described it as Guy Fieri's terror dome of food.  I love Anthony Bourdain.  He's the man.  He is the greatest.  He is the best.  But yeah, so the New York Times put out just a horrible review.  Maybe the worst review they've ever written.  Don't you think a review like that, because it's so bad, people are going to be like,  let's just see how bad it is.  Yeah.  It could almost be reverse of the effect that it would have.  I think so.  And the reviewer was like super douchey.  Like, he was like.  Pompous.  He was making fun of the menu and all this stuff. 
[03:42:30]  And like, he wasn't giving credence to the fact that it is what it is.  Like, he wasn't just being like, well, it's one of these restaurants.  So, like, he wasn't rating it.  He was like, he was like, this is not a five-star restaurant.  And you're like, no, the guy wears, the guy still bleaches his hair.  I mean, he has tips.  Yeah, he's got tips.  He wears like LA gel.  Yeah, nobody, like, generally, at a five-star restaurant, they do wear button-up shirts,  but they don't have flames running off them.  You know what I mean?  That doesn't normally happen at most five-star. 
[03:43:00]  There aren't studs running up and down their sleeves.  It's not per se.  Per se.  It's not La Bernadette.  It's.  By the way, that's called La Bernadette.  What is it called?  La Bernadette.  La Bernadette Peters.  You know, that restaurant.  It's right on Broadway.  Go give me a water.  It's called, what's it called?  Guy Fieri's Terror Dome?  It's a, to that fair, he's American restaurant.  American Grill.  Grill and restaurant.  Something, I don't know.  And he's got like, his whole thing, he's got like infinity beers, and like, he's got five  bars within the restaurant. 
[03:43:30]  So that's what he's trying.  And I think they described one of his mixed drinks as being like a combination of radiator  fluid and something else.  I don't know, but it wasn't something you should consume as a human.  Yeah, yeah.  Maybe that's what it was.  He just mixes the drinks and all the products he uses on his face and hair.  Yeah, he did.  He takes, he takes his drinks.  He'll have a drink and then he'll pour it over his head.  He looks like if Miss Piggy's boyfriend were, were to become human.  That's what he looks like.  The pig, not Kermit.  Not Kermit.  Like if Miss Piggy had like a pig boyfriend. 
[03:44:00]  Right.  It would be him.  But into human form.  But into human form.  You were on, the reason I'm bringing this up is because you were on Minute to Win It.  I was.  The Guy Fieri game show.  I was.  Because I went to your website after the last time you were here.  And I was looking through, which is what?  Jessimaypeluso.com?  Just Jessimay.com.  Good.  Yeah.  Keep it simple like Cher.  Yeah.  Jessimay.  Except Cher is one syllable.  That's right.  I was like four and I'm not really that successful in my.  No, but you can auto, you can auto tune the shit out of yourself. 
[03:44:30]  And you wear that outfit just like she did with a thong in the leather jacket.  I do that in the mornings.  Well, you got to work out in something.  But Jessimay has this whole section of the TV she's done.  And it's every, first of all, it's every terrible reality show.  Like most people, I was expecting to be like, oh, I've popped up on like, I love the 90s.  Or like, I was on a scene in this sitcom or whatever.  And it's every, you know, all those true TV reality shows that we talk about how fake they are?  They're so bad. 
[03:45:00]  They're so bad.  Jessimay's been on all of them.  And if you watch the clips, it's not the girl who's on the show.  It's not you.  It's your acting.  Yeah.  You're performing.  Yeah.  I mean, they, you know, it's cheaper for them to hire comedians to do the stupid shit  and safer than for them to have to actually go out to these people and do what they're doing.  It's not a reality show.  No, it's not.  It's performed.  It's acting.  It's, yeah.  It's a scripted show.  It's so, it's like the next step of reality.  It's like produced reality. 
[03:45:30]  So do you get a script or do they just count on you to improv?  They just kind of improv.  See, this is the bullshit.  Yeah, you improv.  They don't want to hire writers.  Nope.  But they're not creative enough to think of a good reality show.  Nope.  So they just.  And they pay you shit.  They don't pay well.  I mean, they pay, but it's like, you know, for what you're doing, you're writing, you're  acting, you're doing all this other shit.  You're creating their show.  Technically, you're creating their show.  And you don't even get to put it as a credit because you're like, I've been on whatever,  like, what shows were you on?  It was all worked up. 
[03:46:00]  What shows, what's all worked up?  It's on True TV.  What's the premise?  It's like, you know, this reaper, this, uh, bailsman's going out.  People owe money and they're, you know.  But none of the people actually owe money.  No, it's it.  None of them.  I threw a tire at the guy.  Did you see?  I threw a tire at him.  I didn't even know my strength, but I threw a tire and a cone at him.  But you weren't really mad at him.  You were faking it.  No, I just needed the money.  So.  Starving artist.  So all these shows are faked. 
[03:46:30]  Yes.  And then.  Game shows are too.  I keep clicking clips and you're on Minute to Win it.  And I go, oh, Jessie Mae was on Minute to Win it.  I would think that, like, a comedian would kind of be above, like, just showing up at  a game show taping and being in the audience and being like, I'll be on the show.  Yeah.  And then she comes out on stage and Guy Fieri's like, we got Jessica here.  And you're like, Jessica?  I go, that person's name isn't Jessica.  I've met her.  That's Jessie Mae Peluso.  That was all fake. 
[03:47:00]  All fake.  And they wouldn't let me say that I was a stand-up comedian.  I had to say I was a horse wrangler.  A horse.  Now, given, they were just trying, they basically were like, what else do you like in life besides  making people laugh?  And I'm like, I don't know, horses.  I was joking, they're like, perfect, horse wrangler.  You're going to have a, you're going to open a dude ranch for children with disabilities.  I'm like, what?  What?  That's a lot of backstory for me to think about.  I don't like kids.  What are you talking about?  So much backstory.  But you were on the show, it was the Minute to Win it couples. 
[03:47:30]  And you were on the show with your best friend.  Who I didn't know.  One?  Yeah.  It wasn't your best friend at all.  I met her two weeks prior.  Where?  At the, at training.  For, for Minute to Win it, Sam.  They train you to learn the damn games.  On Guy Fieri, on the show, Guy Fieri was always like, you know, we tell them what games,  so they do get to practice.  I thought that meant like you practice at home.  No, they drill you.  I mean, it's like we're in a camp with no light and water for two weeks.  Oh my God.  We have to learn the games.  That's terrible. 
[03:48:00]  It's horrible.  We're like an MC, NBC studios for two weeks learning these stupid, how to throw ping pongs  into cups of water from 45 feet away from a blowing fan while midgets are running underneath.  Do you get paid for the whole two weeks?  I mean, they give you a stipend, but.  Why?  That's, it just seems so complicated.  It's so complicated.  Like, why would you be like, I have a game show idea, but I have no faith in humanity.  So we're going to pay people for weeks at a time.  We're going to put money and effort into training people for weeks just to put on this game 
[03:48:30]  show that's completely fake.  Of drinking games.  Of drinking games.  Essentially, they're drinking games.  Like, why not make the game slightly simpler?  Right.  And just actually get people out of the crowd.  Just get people out of the crowd.  How much more fun would that be?  Of course.  Well, for you, much more fun.  Much more fun.  Because you wouldn't have to lie about your existence.  I wouldn't have to study myself.  But don't they think like, oh, well, if this comedian actually like becomes famous, it  will be clear that our show is fake.  Right.  They don't think that.  Right. 
[03:49:00]  They don't think that.  Like, okay, well, they obviously had no faith in me.  Yeah.  Like, you know what?  No, no, no.  Stand up comedy.  Horse wrangler.  She's not exactly Louis CK.  Okay.  We're talking about Jesse May Peluso.  Here's some horses.  Here's some deaf kids.  So, now, did you know, was this news to you that the reality shows were all faked?  Well, once after I did like the All Worked Up, I started, and you know, just all my friends  were doing like all the other shows too.  So, we just started to figure it all out.  But the Minute to Win It thing, they didn't preface it that way. 
[03:49:30]  So, you thought like, they're like, okay, yeah, we're going to use you and, you know,  we're going to use your story, blah, blah, blah, blah.  So, you just thought, oh, they must want me because I'm a comedian and I can be funny on  stage.  Yeah.  It's while I'm doing the games.  Exactly.  Because that's the way the audition was.  You're auditioning like it's going to be, you know, they have you play a couple games  and they ask you questions about yourself and they're like, oh, okay, great.  You'd be great.  It's not exactly 21 questions anymore, is it?  No, it's not.  It's so funny too because 21 questions like was a scandal.  It was, the answers were faked and it was a scandal that was so huge they dramatized 
[03:50:00]  it and made it into a film.  Now, Guy Fieri is just getting on TV and being like, I don't know.  I don't know.  Jesse May doesn't work.  And he kept like staring down, you know, had my, they of course make us wear these like stupid  tight shirts.  You worry.  They wanted me in booty shorts.  And I was like, listen, I drew the line of the deaf kids.  I'm not putting on, putting booty shorts on while I'm flipping keys out of my mouth  onto this two inch table.  Plus, let's think realistically about the character, Jessica, that you're playing.  Where's my inspiration?  Exactly. 
[03:50:30]  Who wrangles horses and has a farm and invites deaf kids and then wears booty shorts to TV?  I mean, come on.  It doesn't work.  It doesn't work.  You'd be too awesome for booty shorts.  It doesn't work.  And in off air, in between takes, I told you this.  I was just like, you know, being myself, cracking jokes.  And I said two things, a couple of things to, to Guy.  And he used two of my lines on air.  The jokes that you told him before.  I basically wrote for him.  So I had to change my whole persona. 
[03:51:00]  I'm writing for Guy Fieri.  Fuck Ferreri.  Whatever his stupid name is.  I call him Fieri.  I refuse.  Stupid name is.  I refuse.  And I, you know, I'm not even getting like.  And so you're sitting there like, you're writing the, that show you're writing to.  I wrote Minute to Win It.  I wrote the whole show.  Roland, is Guy Fieri's imaging collapsing around you?  Yeah.  He's all right.  Roland doesn't care.  He doesn't give a shit about much.  No.  As long as it doesn't affect me, I'm like, oh, whatever.  So you're jaded then.  I mean, I'm just, you know.  I wish they would have given me a real shot. 
[03:51:30]  So how did you, how did you, yeah.  How did you react when Guy was like, started just spouting out your lines?  What were, do you remember the jokes?  Oh, God, I don't.  Because it was just, it wasn't even anything that I pre-wrote.  It was just something I said that was funny that he liked.  And the moment the camera was on, he said it.  And I just was like, I was off to the side.  I was like, what the fuck?  I'm looking at the producers and I'm like this.  Yeah.  Fuck this shit.  Let me flip these stupid, whatever next, blow the balloons away.  And let me go home with some decency and dignity. 
[03:52:00]  I'm assuming they don't fix the games because that's why they train you.  No, they do.  They fix the games too?  They have like the games.  And then the last game we never, I mean, some of them you can get through, but some of them  are so hard you'd have to know how to play.  They have a couple of those like that.  Because while you're in camp, they're learning which ones you're good at and which ones you  suck at.  So they make a plan of where you're going to stop.  Oh, my God.  So when the sweeps come, will somebody win the million dollars?  Right.  Yeah.  Oh, that's dirty. 
[03:52:30]  You know, they kind of like fix it all.  But you don't know.  Like they're not fixing it with you.  No.  And so you're sitting there being like, I think I'm going to win this thing.  I think they're going to let me win.  Yeah.  And then they're like, they throw this game at you like, now you have to throw tissues  into a basketball hoop.  And you're like, they know I can't do that.  Why would they do this?  Nobody can do this.  Yeah.  The wind, it's a tissue.  It just gets swept away by the wind.  It's an impossible game.  Exactly.  That's the way it is.  Oh, my God.  And they're all like in the.  So are the people on the reality shows like the Bales Bondsman? 
[03:53:00]  Is he completely fake too?  They're all fake.  The guys who star on the shows?  Yep.  They're not real?  None of them are real.  What are they?  I mean, he was like, I think he had like a used car shop that, I mean, he just was like  a black guy with a deep voice that just worked for their.  And what?  Somebody like found him in his used car shop?  Yeah.  And they were like, you could be a Bale Bondsman.  He does like voiceover work.  He does voiceover work.  Oh, my God.  And they just have to count on you to be like, yeah, you could be a Bale Bondsman. 
[03:53:30]  Yeah, sure.  Go ahead.  How disillusioning.  Isn't it so hard?  And I had to go out to the middle of like somewhere in the hope, like outside of Hoboken.  It's like a really scary part of Jersey to shoot this shit.  I want to be on one of these shows.  How do you get on a show?  Let's make one.  Just fake it?  Yeah.  What would you be?  A horse wrangler.  Okay.  Obviously.  And I'm going to start bleaching my hair and just steal your jokes.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But can you like, how do you get cast on these shows?  I want to be like, because it'd be so funny if I could get on and then all the radio fans 
[03:54:00]  would be like, it's fucking Sam pretending he's not Sam.  That's hilarious.  That would be awesome.  Can you get me on a show, Roland?  Roland, you should do that.  Yeah.  Do you know, were you aware of all this?  Yeah.  Why wouldn't you say it?  Because.  The code.  The code.  The code.  You're not down with the code anymore.  I broke the code.  Sorry, everybody.  Sorry.  Have you given up on...  There's other shows that do it.  Like what?  Like...  I don't know what I'm saying.  Okay, so it's not just true TV though?  No.  I mean, like, you know, dog.  That shit's all set up. 
[03:54:30]  You know, I was on Figured Out on Nickelodeon when I was like 13.  Do you think that the judges set that up?  Absolutely.  Fuck.  That's horrible.  Yeah.  I thought I won the game show.  No, you didn't.  Absolutely not.  You weren't even on it.  That was actually a hologram and...  No, I could have sworn I was there.  No, no, you weren't there.  I flew to Orlando.  You weren't there.  That actually was not you.  Danny Tamburelli?  No, never happened.  Well, Jessie Mae, let me tell you about the greatest gift a woman could ever get.  Do you know what it is?  Not, I mean, not for me.  It's not cupcakes like she promised to bring us. 
[03:55:00]  I know, I was going to bring them.  Why didn't you bring cupcakes this time?  See, Tex, I'm going to bring cupcakes.  I was going to bring cupcakes.  And then when I was walking into the building, I just had a total brain fart.  That's terrible.  And I walked right through the doors.  And I went up and down the elevator three or four different times because I didn't know  where the hell I was going.  Just riding the elevator.  Just riding the elevator.  Up and down.  Yeah.  Miss, where are you going?  I don't know.  Have a fucking cupcake.  Have a cupcake.  All right.  There's an insane woman in the building.  No, if you ask women, like the best gift they ever got. 
[03:55:30]  But every time they'll tell you what, you know by now, engagement rings.  Women are crazy.  Well, they love their engagement rings.  They sure do.  And they go crazy for them.  I mean, you know, have you had friends that were engaged?  Yeah.  I mean, I tried to stop it, but it still happened.  You don't believe in marriage?  I think it's, I don't know.  That's because you've never had an engagement ring.  Yeah.  If I had an engagement ring, maybe I would change my mind.  You would be staring at that shit all the time.  I just would want to get engaged over and over, not married.  Well, that's, that's, I mean, that's where Steven Singer comes in.  Because everybody knows that that's the best part, giving the girl the ring. 
[03:56:00]  And then the girl goes nuts for her all the time.  So you have to make sure as a guy, not you, Jessie Mae, but like me or Roland, we have to  make sure we're getting a good ring.  Because otherwise the girl would be like, who you think I am?  You can't propose to me with this.  I ain't marrying your broke ass.  And you're like.  Who are you marrying?  That sounds like, like one of the basketball wives.  No, one of the chicks from True TV.  Okay, okay.  Yeah.  That's good.  Who escaped the bail bondsman.  Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Um, they'll tell you that, you know, they don't, they don't want any part of it. 
[03:56:30]  So, you go to Steven Singer.  You make sure that he's getting you a great ring.  Because he does it all day long.  That's all he does.  Who's Steven Singer?  He owns the store.
