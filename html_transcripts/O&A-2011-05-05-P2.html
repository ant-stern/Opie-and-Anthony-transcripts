<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony "After 0 and 8 Live" broadcast, hosted by Sam Roberts, opened with a discussion featuring Rich Voss, who was distraught over the poor performance of his YouTube video with Kenan Cahill.  Despite Cahill's immense popularity, the video only received around 10,000 views. Voss blamed his lack of promotion and Sam's commentary during filming.  The conversation expanded into a debate on the relative merits of radio versus YouTube and effective online promotion strategies. Brad, a fellow online content creator, and CokeLogic, who collaborated with Voss on a documentary animation, called in to offer promotional advice.  The discussion veered off into tangents about the show's lack of phone calls, the upcoming Covino and Rich Guac-Off, a listener's call about the Washington Capitals, and Voss's parking garage woes due to a presidential visit.  The contrast between Voss's YouTube failure and the success of an unrelated baby video was briefly highlighted.  The segment also touched upon perceptions of the show, the hosts' appearances, and a disagreement with Bobo, a previously banned caller.  Covino and Rich, also present in the studio, briefly discussed their guacamole contest and their position within SiriusXM.  Voss eventually left, still lamenting his YouTube flop.

The show then shifted to focus on Bobo, whose six-month suspension had ended.  The segment detailed Bobo's aggressive attempts at reinstatement, including numerous calls to the show's office, talent bookers (including Liam), and even the morning show’s office.  The unexpected highlight was Bobo's unscheduled call-in, performing his "one-man band" act live from a public bus, employing an air horn and a kazoo, and teasing his "dick song."  Initially amused, the hosts became increasingly exasperated by Bobo's disruptive behavior.  Bobo’s performance was implied to be poorly received by fellow bus passengers.  Despite this, Sam Roberts reinstated Bobo on probation, contingent on him contacting everyone he’d previously harassed to inform them of his return. The show concluded with announcements of upcoming events, including a Doug Stanhope performance at Caroline's.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  The virus, Sirius XM, and now, the Opie and Anthony Show continues, and this is After 0 and 8 Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  Wrong!  What do you mean?  Well, look who's here.  Really?  I got one over here too.  Really?  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  Really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really.  Something. 
[00:00:30]  I'm still here because I have to bitch about something.  Rich Foss is still in the studio.  Why couldn't you do that on your show?  Because we ran out of time.  Oh.  So I figured, what the fuck?  We'll continue a little bit.  You have an hour show now?  That's right.  No, he doesn't.  Come on sometime.  He hosts the shitty bits we played a million times.  Yeah, really?  Just to make it sound like it's, you know...  How many bits do I play?  Ten.  Ten an hour or about?  Incorrect.  You should come on sometime.  On your show?  Well, why would I leave their show, which is the major show in the country, to come on 
[00:01:00]  to do your fucking ham radio show?  It'll sleep in a little bit.  I'll do it.  So that's what's happening.  Yeah, yeah.  You do it?  I gotta go.  I do gotta go because Kenny is completely panicking because I guess they're gonna shut  down the street.  They're shutting down the city.  In 15 minutes.  So Kenny has a very small window to get the fuck out of Manhattan before Obama shows up.  I'm going to get my car then.  What?  I thought you were gonna do the show.  I'm walking out with you.  I just had...  Kenny's already pulled your car out.  Mine... 
[00:01:30]  Mine...  All right, I'll wait.  Let's go.  My car isn't pulled out of the garage.  Give me a couple minutes.  I just want to acknowledge that...  That...  How bad we are.  Who?  Me.  Okay.  And you.  Me?  And you're part of this, sir.  Why am I...  I'm not bad.  I want to show you how little pull I got out there in the world of social networking.  You know that video we did with Kenan Cahill?  Yeah.  Kenan Cahill, I don't know if you know.  He's a YouTube sensation.  Phenomenon.  He has 250 million views for his videos. 
[00:02:00]  He lip syncs.  And that's not even counting the ones that he's done for other people, by the way.  His channel has 250 million views.  But then he's done videos for other people that have done millions and millions of views.  He's a kid with the big head and the thick glasses and lip syncs everything.  Unbelievable.  He's three and a half feet tall, probably.  Yeah.  No joke.  And he has big glasses and he looks just kind of funny.  He looks funny.  And he lip syncs.  And for some reason, the YouTube world has just fucking gobbled this shit up, okay? 
[00:02:30]  He's done videos with 50 Cent.  Jennifer Aniston.  He's done some for Chelsea Handler.  What else?  Katy Perry.  Katy Perry.  He had...  Lil Jon.  Lil Jon.  It's unbelievable how many people have done videos with this guy.  So he's walking around Sirius XM and I'm thinking, holy shit, fuck the radio show.  If I can get him on video lip syncing, my YouTube channel is going to go through the fucking roof.  That's my actual thought on the whole thing, okay?  But isn't the radio show more valuable? 
[00:03:00]  I guess.  If you still care about radio, yeah, I guess.  I do.  But I'm thinking, you know, a year or so in advance here.  And I'm setting up for other things, Sam.  So he comes in and does exactly what he's done for everybody else.  He lip syncs a song by Kesha Blow.  Yes.  Blow is huge.  So Blow is a huge song right now.  So it's perfect.  You got the little fucker that's a YouTube sensation.  He's on our show.  I got my video camera.  And we got the hottest song in America that he can lip sync to.  No brainer as far as a video going viral, right? 
[00:03:30]  Viral.  I don't think he's done a video that has done less than a million or so views, okay?  So we do this little thing with Kenan Cahill.  Sam is commenting on most of the video.  And I put it up on my YouTube channel, right?  Now, after everything I just said, how many views do you think this fucking video got?  You would think millions, right?  I know one you didn't get, but yeah, you would think.  You would think millions.  You would think, all right, maybe if it's not as good as the others.  There's a couple hundred thousand views.  How long has it been up? 
[00:04:00]  Long enough, I think.  It's been up since three days?  Monday?  Three days?  Tuesday.  So three days, I would say 70,000.  All right.  It's a conservative estimate.  I checked it this morning.  It's done 6,000 views.  What?  I'm a fucking loser.  Well, you're not promoting it.  And you are, too, because you were associated with this video.  But it's not on Not Sam YouTube.  You don't need to promote it.  If Kenan Cahill is lip syncing, that tiny little fucker with big glasses,  all you have to do is put it up, and the people find it, and it becomes a viral sensation. 
[00:04:30]  So I'm going to be the guy that has the shitty fucking video.  Well, you've got to get Perez Hilton to put it up.  And then people will see it.  Perez Hilton loves that.  All the other people, they didn't have to do anything extra.  I have a question, though.  They were celebrities.  Fucking 6,000 views.  He did 38 million with Teenage Dream, right?  Yeah.  Katy Perry's Teenage Dream.  He did 38 million on one video alone.  Was Katy Perry in it?  I don't know.  Was she?  I think so.  All right.  That might have helped.  Yeah, but the other videos he's done where it's just pure lip syncing. 
[00:05:00]  You can get your own YouTube channel, your own channel?  Yes.  What?  How did he do it?  What did he just ask?  How did he do it?  What did he just ask?  I thought you just put up YouTube videos.  Yeah, but when you put up the YouTube videos, it's like Rich Voss.  Yeah.  Then if you go to YouTube slash Rich Voss, all your videos are there.  Yeah.  That's your channel.  Oh, well, I thought you had to start your own channel.  I thought there was some...  Well, I could broadcast live.  I didn't fucking know.  How do I know everything?  It's bring a kid to work day.  Oh.  Again.  Yeah, but this kid...  Again, by the way. 
[00:05:30]  Okay.  But the video you took with me and the baby got more than 6,000 views.  Oh, yeah, it did.  Yeah, that one did very well.  Let me look right now.  Well, give it time.  It's got to have time.  Nah, man.  It's got to build.  It's got to have a nice build.  Oh, wait.  Oh, I was wrong.  It's done.  I was wrong, Sam.  It's up to 10,000 views.  Boom.  There you go.  It's still going.  We're at five figures now.  10,000.  The national debt didn't start at 40 billion.  It had to start somewhere.  Exactly.  So do I blame you doing the commentary of the lip syncing?  No, and here's why.  And I'm really...  And this is a controversy thing because you shouldn't have said anything. 
[00:06:00]  Here's why you can't blame...  I should have said something because we were having a guy lip sync on the radio.  A 10 o'clock hour is a throwaway hour, so it doesn't matter.  We don't have to work hard on this hour.  You guys...  This is just a let's fool around a little bit, keep the channel alive until we're on a fez.  There's no pressure here.  So we should have had Keenan Cahill sit there, lip sync.  Obviously, the radio audience would just think they're hearing Kesha's blow.  That's fine.  And then they turn it.  Then I got a crystal clear video of this guy lip syncing, and then I would have got my millions of views. 
[00:06:30]  Instead, I got 10,000 lousy views on a fucking video that should have went viral.  Why didn't you take the video, strip the sound out, like you did anyway...  Oh, here's Brad.  And instead of replacing it with our show audio, just put the song on.  It's on iTunes.  It costs $1.29.  I think it's too late.  Why don't you redo it and act like it's happening?  Brad.  Hey, guys.  You try, Rich.  When you upload a video, you've got to put in description words.  So when people search this little kid out, your video will be one of the videos that come up. 
[00:07:00]  Is this Brad, the other YouTube sensation guy?  I wish I was a YouTube sensation, but no.  You're not?  Brad's no YouTube sensation.  You're not a YouTube sensation guy?  But look at the way people are calling in and stuff.  This is not a throwaway hour.  You guys threw it away.  Dude, we have two phone calls.  It's a throwaway hour.  Because I don't go to phones.  If me and or Jim fart, guess what?  Every phone is ringing because they want to discuss the fart.  But I don't go to phones.  People know.  I've set a precedent.  There's two lousy fucking phone calls right now.  What fucking words did I miss out on? 
[00:07:30]  You're going to make these phones light up.  Put the kid in.  Put K-Show the name of the song.  I did all that.  I did everything.  Take your name off.  Yeah.  Look, this is going to make a lot of the haters very happy today.  I'm admitting I'm a fucking loser.  I don't think you're a loser.  Because I couldn't get a Kenan Cahill video to go viral like everyone else did without trying.  I don't think you're a loser, but I don't think you should be blaming me for your shortcomings.  You're a loser, social networking failure today. 
[00:08:00]  Thank you.  I don't think that's true.  I absolutely am.  But I don't think I should get blamed for your shortcomings.  I don't think that's fair.  Are you on Wi-Fi?  Look at the phones light up, Opie.  Because I told them to call.  Whose show are they listening to?  They're still listening to Opie, and you're here.  Listen, I don't take phone calls on this show.  That's why people don't call it.  You guys threw this show out.  I picked up your trash, and I'm turning it into something glorious.  I put all the main keywords in my video, and it just fucking failed miserably. 
[00:08:30]  Hey, Sam.  I stayed late to tell everyone I'm a failure, and I failed miserably on this fucking Kenan Cahill.  Don't be so hard on yourself.  Failed miserably.  Someone should do the research.  The second worst Kenan Cahill video.  And I guarantee it would be...  It would still dwarf yours.  It would be hundreds of thousands of views.  I'm not even close.  What about the fact that we got him on the radio?  Huh?  No one gives a fuck that we had that little fucker on the radio.  I was doing it for the YouTube world.  Well, I was doing it for the radio audience. 
[00:09:00]  And my little dumb world.  My world is still on the radio.  CokeLogic will help me.  CokeLogic?  Oh.  Hey, what's going on?  Hey, buddy.  CokeLogic did an animation for Rich Ross's documentary.  He's done three of them.  Yeah, CokeLogic is a very talented guy.  He's done three of them.  I still owe him a check for the last one.  It'll be there.  What did I do?  Go ahead, CokeLogic.  No, what was Rich going to say about money?  No, I said...  Don't worry about it.  I said...  Hey, Kenny, call the show really fast.  Go ahead, CokeLogic.  My show, not Sam's show.  No, it's my show right now.  No, this is called... 
[00:09:30]  It's opening up with Sam Roberts.  You know what?  You know what I just came up with?  What?  Opie Break-In.  I just broke in to your motherfucking show.  And it's your channel, so you could probably...  Shit!  And I'm going to start doing this more and more.  Why?  It's my show.  I did it.  You didn't want to do it.  No, it was the Opie and Anthony show.  And you guys stopped doing the 10 o'clock hour.  Then it was the Sam's sort of show, and now it's the opening.  It was never the Sam's sort of show.  Can you guys give me the show?  I was going to fucking call in.  Are you getting paid for this?  I'm not getting paid for almost anything I do in this company.  Did you like our first 15 minutes of our movie?  It was great. 
[00:10:00]  CokeLogic, go ahead.  For real.  Yeah, it was.  You saw me laughing.  Oh, okay.  CokeLogic.  Yeah.  Let's keep the quality up before people say that I suck without Jimmy and Ant.  Go ahead.  Continue.  No, you're doing great.  You're doing great.  I got your back.  Thank you, Sam.  CokeLogic, go ahead.  What you got to do is tweet just more than once and expect to, you know.  But then the people bitch that I tweet too much for my own fucking benefit.  You know what I do?  I'll tell you.  When I make a video, three tweets about it.  Yeah, but you got to tweet different videos differently.  I figured it out.  Three tweets. 
[00:10:30]  You got to feed videos to certain areas.  Like, the Kenan video should have gotten fed to pop culture areas.  Like, send it to different people.  They should have.  Did you send it to what would Tyler Durden do?  They should just find it on their own, man.  See, this is not what you're not.  They're fucking putting Kenan Cahill in the search engine every day.  They saw this video and chose not to do anything with it.  Nobody knows his name.  How do you send videos on Twitter?  You just put a link.  How do you do it?  No, but, oh, here's the thing.  No, I want to hear some real, getting real help from CokeLogic.  Go ahead, Coke.  I'm giving you the help. 
[00:11:00]  When you're tweeting, it's like, yeah, that's fine, and you have your little rule of three  times, because you don't want to overplug it and stuff, but are you spreading that out  where it's like you're not bothering people, but still, you know.  Listen, you know what?  I start over-tweeting starting today because of CokeLogic, and people are going to not be  happy with that.  Did you send it to what would Tyler Durden do?  Oh, my God.  Well, you've got friends who run big websites.  Oh, my God.  You're not even listening.  I'm giving you the answers. 
[00:11:30]  No, because I got a text message from Kenny.  Sorry, this is more important.  I can't stop on Blank Street.  There are cops everywhere.  I got to go.  Cops won't let me wait.  Sorry.  You just lost your ride.  I just got abandoned.  I got a car.  I got a car.  You're fucked, too.  Why?  Because Kenny can't stop.  That was the only reason.  I'm in a parking garage.  See, you're not even smart enough to understand what I just did.  I made you wait, not because I care about doing radio with you, because I knew if  you hung up on Facebook.  If you hung around long enough, now you can't leave.  That was my whole goal. 
[00:12:00]  Oh, really?  Is that a nice thing?  Don't try to get your car.  No, it's not nice, but it was fun.  Oh, no?  It's not as fun as hearing about your 10,000 tweets on fucking under 2,000 hits.  No, it was 10,000 views on a video that should have got a million minimum.  That was more fun.  Oh, minimum.  A minimum of a million views.  You've got to send this video out.  You can't wait for the world to come to you.  You have to grab it by the balls if you want to be a viral star.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Is this a motivational hour?  Yes, it's a motivational hour.  So Charlie bit my finger.  They promoted that video, and they pushed it out to all the fucking media outlets. 
[00:12:30]  Listen, they didn't want it, though.  Or did people just find it because it was that damn good?  I wanted to have some shows on Sirius.  I didn't wait for people to come and offer them.  I took them.  I wanted the 10 o'clock hour.  Nobody offered it to me.  I snatched it.  You've got to grab life by the balls.  Oh, shit, Tony Robbins.  Yeah.  CokeLogic, I'm going to start tweeting more and promoting my videos more.  And sending it to other people.  Awesome.  And I'm going to take a course on how to work Twitter.  Yeah.  Because I'm going to start sending a video. 
[00:13:00]  You don't even know how to send a video through Twitter yet?  I've never tried yet.  So how do I know?  Have you made a video?  What do you mean?  I've got a million videos, but what do you mean?  James, go ahead.  Hey, buddy.  Did you see anything about the Capitals losing again?  We're not talking about hockey on this show.  Capitals got their ass kicked.  This is not the hockey show.  By a 43-year-old goalie, by the way.  That the Islanders used to have.  Roll us it.  Well, you have four hours to talk about hockey.  We're not talking about hockey here.  You're trying to take control of this hour.  Are you serious? 
[00:13:30]  It's mine.  You hear his voice get high?  It's mine.  That's my cadence.  That's the cadence of this show.  You think the Lightning could win this whole thing there, James, or what?  Do people care about this?  I don't think so.  Huh?  I think they have a good shot.  Are we in Canada?  I don't know.  I don't know.  And the Bruins dismantling the Flyers.  I really didn't see that coming.  Neither did I.  I didn't see it at all.  You guys don't like hockey?  Hockey?  I don't know.  Sports.  What are you going to do for the rest of the day now that you can't get your car for  three hours?  That's a question I would bring up on this show.  First of all, I'll be able to get my car. 
[00:14:00]  Oh, really?  What do you think they're locking down?  If he's going down to ground zero...  Kenny, who has a lot of credentials, just abandoned me.  Yeah.  He panicked and said, look, there's nothing I can do.  And so did your viewers on Twitter.  Oh.  No, it's YouTube.  YouTube.  Whatever.  I do all right.  You got to play it, Ross.  I do all right.  I should have more followers.  I don't.  But I do okay.  You know, it's funny because I'm in studio now with you and Sam, but I look at you and  then I just look at Sam's hair and I still think I'm here with you and Anthony. 
[00:14:30]  It's almost like you've got to have fucked up hair to be in that section of the studio.  It's not fucked up.  No, it doesn't look bad.  Why are you using an advanced mic?  Because you won't give me my mic.  This is my mic.  No, no, no, no, no.  Look at the clock.  That's not your mic anymore.  Why the fuck am I here?  I could be sleeping.  I'm getting...  No, because you'd be stuck in...  You can't sleep in that parking lot.  You'd be stuck in.  Rich, I'm serious.  You're not going to be able to get your car in.  I'm going to get my car.  It's a small car.  Well, we'll videotape that.  That's today's video.  You'll be laughing as they say you can't get your car until five tonight.  Get the fuck out of here. 
[00:15:00]  I'm not joking.  Until five tonight.  They don't lock the whole city down.  Everybody's not locked in here.  Did you see the barricades up?  Yeah, I thought there was a parade.  That's where Obama is coming.  Yeah, and he's leaving.  So they lock down the area.  Until he's gone.  And then they unlock it.  But he's seen the firehouse at around noon.  So it's going to be at least until noon.  I'm not kidding.  No fucking way.  I'm not kidding.  You know what?  Fuck.  No way.  I swear to you.  You can't leave now.  It won't make a difference.  I will leave because I'm in a parking garage. 
[00:15:30]  And that was my whole motive to keep you late.  Oh.  Did he get you?  Whoa.  I'm a motive man.  Oh, fuck.  I'm getting...  I hope he got spoiled with the homeless mustard video.  Yeah, but I had nothing to do with that.  That's not my creation.  The guy with talent, we put a camera on him.  But neither is the...  I don't take any credit for that.  What happened?  That's one from Norton.  That's Norton's dick?  Probably not.  It's probably the one that's in his room with him. 
[00:16:00]  Norton just texted a boner picture to Rich Voss.  Norton's already got an erection?  He must be listening to this show.  Sam, Big Dick Dudley says Kenan Cahill is played out.  So once again, we get the guy past his...  If Kenan Cahill...  First of all, Big Dick Dudley is dead.  So you talk about played out.  And second of all, if Kenan Cahill is played out, how come he's still getting millions of views?  This guy was trying to make me feel good, Sam.  You're saying that Kenan Cahill still has a little juice left?  Kenan Cahill still has juice left.  And the way to make you feel better is not for you to accept that you don't have a lot of views. 
[00:16:30]  It's for us to overcome this and figure out how do we bring this video to the top like we're going to do.  It's too late.  We don't accept defeat here on the after show, on After Opie and Anthony Live with Sam Roberts.  There is no defeat.  I'm extremely sad.  This thing should have done really well just by having it up there.  Just by having my name on it.  So, there you go.  I'm admitting it.  I'm a fucking failure.  I don't think you are.  Four and five?  Who's on four?  Oh, really?  Let me say hi to Andrew in Jersey.  Andrew?  Hey, Opa. 
[00:17:00]  How come Sam didn't have any audio from the Chiller Convention last weekend?  Is he saving that for one of his six shows?  I would have done it already if I was saving it.  Where's Rich going?  He's trying to get his car.  What?  You're...  You're...  All right.  What?  Nothing.  The reason I didn't have any audio from the Chiller Convention...  That's fine.  I was talking to Opie.  I wasn't talking to you.  It doesn't matter who you were talking to.  You caught my show.  Yeah, what show are you going to put that audio on?  There is no audio.  They didn't let me do any audio.  Oh.  Chiller Theater doesn't let us do audio because we ruined it with the Linda Blair interview years ago.  I've got to sit here for audio anyhow. 
[00:17:30]  For audio?  I've got to get audio from one of the shows.  The show from the movie.  Our movie.  I didn't get the audio from that day.  So it doesn't matter.  I had to be here anyhow until Bonnie texts me the day.  I don't know the day.  E-Rock just screamed at me.  Tell him to shut up.  E-Rock.  I'm not telling E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  Turn on your mic.  E-Rock.  Why are you saying shut up?  Remember last time he was in and you told him to shut up about things he was talking about?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  He was trying to protect you.  I'm already protected.  Are you sure? 
[00:18:00]  Yeah.  All right, just let it go.  No, no.  Covino and Rich, why are you in here?  Have you heard?  Because I invited them in.  I booked them.  What are you talking about?  I invited them in.  Who just waved you in?  Who are they?  Sam Roberts.  He's the big dog.  Yeah.  Sam Roberts.  Who am I?  Hold on.  I've got to say.  I met you.  Covino and Rich, everybody.  I've been promoting Rich Voss' appearance tonight at my old high school.  No, you're fucking, uh...  I'm Covino from Union High, class of 94.  He was the guy that booked you tonight.  Oh, boy.  And you're saying, who are you?  I haven't met him. 
[00:18:30]  Have I met you?  No, no, no.  I never met him.  But there's a local PBA charity event tonight that Rich Voss is performing at, and they  asked me to help donate.  So I donated a bunch of SiriusXM stuff that you're probably going to get the credit for  tonight.  Well, I played a hell of them, too.  Thank you for everything.  Oh, no, no, no.  Hey, man.  Thanks for having us, guys.  Of course.  I didn't book this.  I did.  It's my show.  You forget these things.  Thank you, Opie.  Thank you, sir.  I mean, I would book you guys, but I didn't.  You don't have the power.  It's my show.  You can't book people for this hour.  And who's the guy walking around the halls with the flyers? 
[00:19:00]  I got one of them.  Well, this is what I'm trying to tell you.  Was that an intern?  Yeah.  First of all, Club Soda Kenny almost ripped your intern's head off.  Yeah.  Because while Voss and Norton were talking to the Wayans brothers, your interns went up  to the Wayans and to Voss and Norton trying to give them flyers.  Dude, we train them hard, man.  And they stopped me as I was trying to go to the bathroom.  We only get a couple of minutes to try to eat or go to the bathroom, and they're stopping  me because you're doing something around here today.  We're doing something.  And you're handing out flyers.  You know how you're always trying, Opie, to figure out how to make it easy radio where 
[00:19:30]  you can just sit there and just let it happen?  Did you say trying?  You perfected the art.  Well, we realize the strategy around here is that people don't notice good radio.  They notice nonsense.  It's nonsense.  Just do it.  So, we figure do something.  We figure you're doing something.  We could do brilliant radio.  We could do good bits.  We could do great parodies.  We could do whatever.  No one's going to notice.  The greatest interview.  We just fucking nailed the definition of this place. 
[00:20:00]  But if we do a guacamole contest in the Fishbowl Studio.  On Cinco de Mayo of all days.  We're a fucking genius.  We're the heroes.  That's literally it.  Opie, it's kind of brilliant.  They've done a guacamole contest on the radio for the last, what, five years?  It's an hour of mediocre radio at best, but everyone around here, it's like a big circle  jerk.  Like, Camino and Rich, brilliant.  We bring in, like, a person from the Food Network.  We let other people submit their guacamole.  It's a no-brainer, but it's dumb.  Did they sell that horse shit?  Did they sell it?  Oh, no. 
[00:20:30]  Well, this year we got Tostitos and Haas Avocados involved.  It's for all the Tostitos this year.  It's that same.  Yeah.  And Bud Light Lime.  I mean, everyone's involved.  But everyone gets excited about it.  Yeah.  And you know what's really funny is we usually invite, like, Martha Stewart, people who,  like, think they're going to win.  Yeah.  And then guys like Jose Mangan from Liquid Metal.  Win.  He win.  Whoa, don't downplay his guac.  He came in here, and what did he make for us?  Tacos and all sorts of shit.  Yeah.  That fucker knows how to make that Mexican food.  But what makes it funny is that we take it really, really serious, and we really, you  know, there's a lot of bragging rights on the line, and it's for the golden mocajete. 
[00:21:00]  And Rich plays on behalf of all the white gringos out there.  So he believes in his guacamole.  Yeah.  I just figured, we'll let you get back to it.  I just figured you'd appreciate the strategy.  Oh, you're going to let me get back to my thing.  I figured you'd enjoy this.  I'm sorry.  Oh, Sam, your thing, right?  Thank you.  Because his thing's done.  It ended at 10.  I'm going to punch you in the face.  Well, he shows over.  That's all I'm saying.  I just figured Opie would appreciate the strategy behind what gets noticed.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We have to do a guacamole contest four years in a row or whatever it is for anybody to 
[00:21:30]  figure out who Covino and Rich are around here.  And you guys are younger and probably more into pop culture than me.  Is this Keenan Cahill done?  Or does he still have a buzz?  We had it on the show right after you guys did it.  I think he sucks.  Rich didn't want to air it.  I fucking, we pre-taped it.  I want to air this.  Because I watch your Opie's Eye videos.  Right.  And they're all hilarious.  And so I clicked on the Keenan Cahill one.  I'm like, this kid doesn't have the internet beef anymore because you would think it would  have more hits by now.  Fuck, we might have ruined it for him.  You think that our video was the overexposure moment?  Dude, I'm so fucking frustrated because finally I'm thinking, and people call me out on this 
[00:22:00]  and they're absolutely right.  You're thinking millions of views?  I'm looking for a viral video, yeah.  So when you write me and say, yes, that's what I'm doing, asshole.  I was watching you.  And I finally thought I had it with this Keenan Cahill.  And my fucking video just upgraded to 10,000.  Yeah.  I saw you harassing Barbra Streisand in the street.  I was watching a bunch of them and I'm like, oh, the Keenan Cahill must have like a fucking  million hits by now.  And I had like 6,000 at the time.  I'm like, he's done.  This kid's done. 
[00:22:30]  It updated.  It's up to 10,000.  I'm embarrassed.  Voss.  Every other video the kid's done has done millions.  Voss thinks too.  Or hundreds of thousands anyway.  The reason it didn't get a lot of hits was because Opie and Anthony's name was attached  to it.  What I was getting at, Sam, I think you talking over his lip syncing might have fucked it up.  Well, I didn't do that for the video.  It's a radio audience.  Unnecessary hyping.  Like Hype Man?  Yes.  It's a radio audience for a lip syncing kid.  We weren't concerned about the radio audience.  Some of us were.  All they would have heard was a Kesha song.  They couldn't handle that.  They would have changed the channel.  And then we would have the lip syncing thing. 
[00:23:00]  It would have been a perfect video and I think it might have worked.  You can get the Kesha song elsewhere.  Do you know what happened on our show?  It was really embarrassing.  Our producer got really mad at Rich.  Rich big time to Keenan Cahill.  This little internet phenom.  16 years old.  He's got some sort of problem.  I think he's 30 by the way.  Some health problem.  He's like 50 really.  No, I really think he's 30 years old.  They just don't want to say it.  Rich, get this.  We're interviewing, talking to this kid and he has nothing to say, right?  He's like, eh, I'm 16.  And Rich started texting somebody in the middle of the interview.  Oh.  I was fucking bored. 
[00:23:30]  Rich was doing Sudoku at one point.  As well as you should have.  He's got to bring it, dude.  If this little kid has a publicist and people, fucking entertain.  You know what?  I could only drink so much out of someone before I'm like, all right, I'm tapped out.  Let me start texting someone.  I know Kavino wanted me on his side there, but I'm on Rich's side.  They have it.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I think our four-minute interview with him was about what he had.  Oh, by the way, by the way, no one has ever uploaded an interview with this kid.  We did.  That video is up to 6,500 views.  6,500?  That's not bad.  That's horrible. 
[00:24:00]  Well, I'm sorry we're not OP radio material.  Listen, he was, I remember the best, what I tapped out was when Kavino said, dude, you're  16, you got, you know, 50 million hits.  Are you getting, like, a lot of side pussy in school and stuff?  And he's like, no.  And, like, elaborating, he's like, eh, no, not really.  And I'm like, all right, this is fucking over.  This is over.  Yeah.  Is he making money at 16?  Does he make any?  He's got to make some money.  I'm sure the artists pay him to get any videos.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  He's 16, making money, and you're doing this for free. 
[00:24:30]  I know.  How do you feel?  And OP's still trying to hijack my show.  You notice OP wouldn't stay late for his own show, but the minute I started doing the  10 o'clock hour, OP's staying late again.  I have nothing bad to say about evil OP, who kept me here.  I'm not evil anymore.  You kept me here.  You just made him miss his car.  I'm trapped in the city.  I'm chill now.  People should know that.  You're not chill.  I'm not evil.  You just have a lot more relaxed and everything.  Because I got things.  You convinced Voss to stay here just because you wanted him to get free.  I was staying waiting for a text from Bonnie.  Is that what you were waiting for?  No.  Did you talk to Liam? 
[00:25:00]  You talked to Liam?  No.  I got to see him.  I'm just looking for him.  Everything's cool here.  Service is fucking cool, man.  Service is fucking cool.  I've always been behind service.  Somebody isolate that.  Now we know you're losing your mind.  All right.  Well, good luck with the guac day, guys.  Thank you, man.  Sorry to barge in here, but it is Sam invited us.  Sam, Opie, Rich.  You guys are invited to the Covino and Rich Annual Guac-Off today.  Around 1 o'clock.  I know you're gone by then, but you're here.  Can I co-host it?  No, you can come in.  It's on Channel 104 now.  Channel 104.  What is your guac-off? 
[00:25:30]  We already explained this, Rich.  This is why you can't leave the show.  It's a guacamole contest.  Are you on Mark the Short Radio?  No, there's no redeeming quality on the air.  You already admitted how horrible the bit is.  It's a horrible bit.  You can't beat him up for it.  The bit's horrible.  It's just what gets attention around this place is when you do some nonsense in that glass studio on the front.  So we have a mariachi band coming, and we're tasting guacamole, and everyone's going to be jerking us off.  Were you guys yesterday that did the Mitch Hedberg thing when Bonnie was here yesterday? 
[00:26:00]  No, that was a comedy channel.  And you know what?  When you guys use the fishbowl, I'm sure they don't block the glass, right?  Every time we do, guess what?  You don't even know we're in there.  That's how proud they are.  To be fair, they can't exactly trust us that we're doing stuff that a lobby of business people wouldn't be offended by.  I remember loving when you guys did, what was it, the dart ass darts or something?  Cherry darts.  That was a great thing because you actually left the morning mashup and went out and watched cherry darts. 
[00:26:30]  Someday there's going to be some young lad in the studio with you guys and go, I loved when you guys did the guacamole challenge.  Yeah, that's how you won me over.  It's my show.  It's the guac-off.  I'm hosting.  Hey, happy Cinco de Mayo, guys.  Sam, thank you for having us.  Thanks, of course.  Hope you later.  That's the big boss.  Just talking to the guy out the window.  Yeah, you know why?  The guac-off.  That's what he's here for.  The big boss is walking around because of the guac-off?  That's right.  It's got a buzz.  I'm a motherfucker.  The interns gave him a flyer.  Yeah.  All right.  Can I go home now?  No.  So I just wanted to admit that I'm a fucking failure. 
[00:27:00]  I don't think you are.  This video was a complete horrible, it was a horrible idea now that we're looking back  on it.  Well, listen.  I mean, it's not my fault for talking over the song on the radio.  And now I've got a bad scene video on my fucking channel, so.  The problem would be that you didn't just get the song and put it on if that's what you  wanted.  I wasn't doing a video.  I was doing a radio show.  That's what I do.  I've done videos before, but in that instance, I wasn't doing a video.  My WrestleMania video is doing pretty well, but I wasn't doing a video with Kenan. 
[00:27:30]  I was doing a radio show.  You, on the other hand, are eye-padding right now.  You're Kenan Cahilling me like you're Rich Davis.  You're big-timing me.  What you don't understand is you can't big-time the host.  It's my show.  I can big-time you.  And that's what I'm doing.  I'm not looking at you right now.  What bit are we playing today, Iraq?  Um, we've got me eating mayonnaise to celebrate Cinco de Mayo.  That's not how you start this.  That's not...  You gotta sell this thing.  No. 
[00:28:00]  Those two guys are like the best-looking guys on the planet.  Why are they on radio?  They can't get a TV gig.  Holy fuck.  I'm not even gay, but you could tell...  They're very handsome.  They're fucking like two-hands...  I'm sitting here, I go, what are they?  Like fucking bathing suit models or something?  I used to look like that.  Huh?  I used to look like that.  I'll come back ten years from now to see them all tired and worn out like me.  You're not worn out.  It happens to all of us.  They're still doing the Glock off.  You don't look bad from the forehead up.  I mean, if you...  This fucking business will wear you out.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:28:30]  Yeah, we all used to look like that.  Go to fucking airports every fucking week.  What?  Comedy.  Comedy's the fucking worst.  Yeah.  At least you gotta stay...  At least you know...  That you can come someplace every morning.  Yeah, for two years.  Yeah, you gotta...  There's no contract for stand-up comedy?  Not when you're...  Not when you're me.  Not when the show you're going on to promote to club is smashing the club you're at.  Yeah.  Yeah, was that uncomfortable for you?  What happened?  When...  What happened?  When...  What happened?  When the stress factory...  Are you trying to interview me again? 
[00:29:00]  You showed up.  She showed up here.  You had just shat on...  All over the club.  And she not only showed up here, but she walked in the studio when the Wayans Brothers were  here.  That was horrible timing.  Why didn't you address it?  She was on the phone all morning.  No, then she wanted to talk to me and she's like...  Blah, blah.  Next time, do this and that.  I'm like, I gotta do a radio show.  I said what I had to say.  She was in all morning in the hallway next to Club Soda Kenny with her boss trying to  figure out exactly what went wrong with the Opie has to pay situation.  Yeah, but...  She felt very badly about it.  That's fine. 
[00:29:30]  I'll pay.  Whatever.  It's fine.  You don't have to.  You don't have to pay.  You've paid enough in your life.  Huh?  You know why he's asking you questions?  Because somewhere he's going to say, listen to me interview Opie.  That's what I'm doing.  That's going to be his fucking, his YouTube fucking clip.  Well, I would videotape this, but Opie's a proven failure on YouTube, so I'm not going  to put this up.  I mean, I'm not going to put up this video.  Oh, shit.  You're right, you're right.  Yeah.  Well, it is...  I'll let you go.  We blew it with Keenan Cahill. 
[00:30:00]  Oh, you're going to let me go, Sam?  That's nice.  It is Cinco de Mayo.  Are they telling you I have to go?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Some...  Line one's gone, Iraq.  Somebody in my ear is actually telling me you've got to go.  I don't know if you have other press or something going on.  Yeah, I get it.  I get it.  You got TV you're doing?  I get it.  You're using my line against me.  GMA or something?  I get it.  I get it.  Maybe Today Show?  I get it.  Kathy Lee and Hoda?  Do you have a problem with my coat, Rich?  No.  What do you think of it now?  What's the problem?  It looks good.  I've taken enough shots of you.  I like it.  That's good.  What do you think?  Huh? 
[00:30:30]  Go ahead.  Say what you have to say.  I have to come in a tent.  There's nothing wrong with it.  Go ahead.  I like it.  It's kind of cool.  It's like you feel like, hey, is this guy in a sleeping bag or is that a style?  When I woke up, it was 45 degrees out, so I decided to go with the winter coat.  Yeah, why not?  What is it, like 80 now?  If you got to get sick, if his wife breathes on him.  You're not going to get sick.  I haven't been sick in a while because I now do flu shots, Rich.  Congratulations.  I heard they're not good.  The flu shot got me really sick when I first got it, which is true, but I haven't been 
[00:31:00]  sick since, which now means I'll be sick next week.  You know who doesn't believe in flu shots?  Who?  Troy Kwan.  He thinks that you don't know what's in them.  Well, that's fair enough.  I mean, you know.  I like that coat, man.  What?  I like my coat.  I thought you were making fun of it.  I still am.  Oh, you don't like the coat?  No, there's nothing wrong with it.  What's wrong with it?  I take enough shots.  No, there's nothing wrong with it.  Go ahead, beat me up if you have it to make yourself feel better.  Go ahead.  How come?  Because that's what I do on a regular basis.  No. 
[00:31:30]  Let's go skin.  Skin?  Skin?  This is not a ski coat.  No, it's not.  What is it?  It is a little bit, because it's kind of waterproof-y.  Yeah.  It's not like a North Face jacket.  No.  It is a little warm.  I mean, it's spring.  It's May.  It's May.  What's wrong?  The color's wrong?  No, no.  I think it's a cool, cool coat.  I like the inside.  I like the inside.  What's wrong with the inside?  The other side.  It's really a fucking...  Look at that.  It's got a picture of a sneaker.  What?  If you buy...  Does that sneaker come with a coat? 
[00:32:00]  Why is there a picture of a sneaker on the inside of your coat?  It's the mansion.  Does that remind you to put your sneakers on before you leave the house?  Rich, this is a converse.  The coat?  It's a very expensive coat, Rich.  That means nothing.  I just bought a new car.  You did?  Yeah, BMW.  328i.  What year?  2008.  You're getting there.  At least you got it closer to the year.  It's not a new car.  They said never buy a brand new car.  Everybody said...  So I went in 2008.  Why didn't you buy a brand new car?  There's a reason. 
[00:32:30]  What is it?  I don't know.  They said nothing.  I don't delve into all the technical...  I didn't even test drive.  I went to the lot.  I go, that one.  How many miles are they saying?  No.  Well, you can't fuck with miles nowadays.  How many miles are they saying?  There's 40,000 on it.  From 2008?  Yeah.  That's about right.  And I got up to 100,000 in my warranty, so it's fucking nice.  I'm glad I'm not getting credit for this hour.  I like Rich because he takes people at their word.  They say, yeah, it's never good to buy a brand new car.  You go, all right.  I didn't even test drive.  I look at it.  I'll take that one. 
[00:33:00]  That's a good one.  I do.  I like the color.  I like it.  It looks good.  It's a BMW.  I know it drives a lot.  It's a used car.  You didn't even test drive it.  Why should I?  I know it drives a lot.  It's a BMW.  It's got to.  It's got to be.  What's the big deal?  Sam, we've been on 40 minutes, two phone calls.  The phone banks were full.  And by the way, you already know one.  We're keeping the ratings up after we leave.  I know the ratings are up.  How do you know?  Ask if they're listening.  Everybody's listening.  Everybody?  Everybody's listening.  What do you think?  Are they going to tune in for random O&A wear stuff that we fill in to fit time?  No.  I think this is a good idea. 
[00:33:30]  Thank you.  I love how I came over this.  I love how E-Rock puts his feet up because it is like the useless hour.  No, E-Rock puts his feet up because he knows.  He doesn't put his feet up between 6 and 10, Sam.  I don't.  Look at him.  He's just chill now.  He looks like a chill E-Rock.  He looks like the drunken guy that got fired on Mad Men, but they came back.  Listen, the reason E-Rock puts his feet up is because you're giving him a stroke, and  so he can't put his feet up.  He can't relax when you're on the air.  He knows he can relax when I'm on the air.  Does he let his guard down as soon as 10 o'clock hits? 
[00:34:00]  Me and him can shoot the breeze a little bit.  I'm not going to trample on him no matter what he does.  He knows the chance of getting beat up is over.  Well, it's not over, over, but I'm not going to just shit on him no matter what.  I'm not going to relax during the 10 o'clock hour because me, Ant, and Jim are gone.  He will once you leave.  Yeah, there's not much going on during this time, so it's easy to unwind.  Plus, he knows that he used to have to play a lot of bits in this time, but now that I've  been hosting for several months, a couple months at this point, he's not going to have  to play bits.  At least you admitted you're hosting. 
[00:34:30]  I don't do personal appearances.  Why not?  You should be at places, at book signings.  I don't have a book to sign.  Well, other people's book signings.  Sam will be here.  Or you should be at openings, at like, you know, like Fast Eddie's or Circuit City openings.  You know what I'm saying.  Well, then, find me on Twitter, not Sam, and book me.  Do you got a sound effect because the OP break-in is over?  I like that coat.  I like the zippers in the front.  I know you do.  Look at these phones lighting up, man.  Do you know why?  We don't even have a phone screener in there still ringing. 
[00:35:00]  I'm going to tell you why I like it.  Holy shit.  Why do you like it?  Because it's not heavy, but it keeps you warm.  You could still do shit in that coat.  Whoa.  You know what I'm saying?  That's the whole fucking marketing thing.  For an active winter.  Sam, like if you're an active winter guy.  And if you lose a sneaker, you can cut out the one in there.  Sam, the OP break-in is over.  So is there a sound effect for my out?  No, this is not scheduled.  And don't use the Ronnie B one because that does sound like break glassing.  Break glass.  Stone Cold.  It's glass breaking.  Wow.  I just did a Rich Foss.  Yeah, really?  I didn't see any spit coming out of your mouth. 
[00:35:30]  Look at these phones lighting up.  Oh shit, look at that lady.  She looks like fucking from Saturday Night Live, Garth or whatever.  From where?  Saturday Night Live.  Oh yeah, Dana Carvey and his Garth wig.  Your thing should be visuals on the radio because you're really good at it.  You just told me that we should have let Keenan Cahill lip sync on the radio.  Because that was for my YouTube channel, not for the show.  That's for the show.  I didn't care about the show.  I just wanted the video.  That's why you weren't talking in that way.  They would have heard Kesha Blow.  They would have been fine with that.  No, they wouldn't have. 
[00:36:00]  They would have changed the channel.  And you got all nervous like, oh boy, we got to fill up the space.  I wasn't nervous at all.  Because this kid is just lip syncing and then you, I think you talk too much to the video.  No, because until the video came out, everybody was like, yeah, holy shit, that was funny.  And then everybody watches the video like, hey, shut up.  How am I going to get this fucking hour back?  What would you want the hour back for?  Where are you going to be this weekend, Rich?  No, no, no, no, no.  No, no, no, Sam.  E-Rock, you got my sound effect?  That can't be my out every time. 
[00:36:30]  Sad Hulk music.  Why don't you hit the brakes, Opie?  Why don't you take off?  You know you're going to pay for that, right, E-Rock?  E-Rock's got my back now.  E-Rock knows, though.  You do know it's going to get ugly now, right?  Yeah, and if I didn't do anything, I wouldn't be treated any better.  Exactly.  You've gotten E-Rock to the point that he doesn't care.  If I'm going to start this Opie break-in bit, I need like a, like a, oh, wow, the channel's  live, Opie's there, and then a boom when I'm done.  All right, let me see what I can find.  Hang on one second.  That was, uh, E-Rock. 
[00:37:00]  Hey, can a bird from a cartoon be up for Best Supporting Actor?  Why?  Did you like, uh...  In Rio.  I've heard Rio was excellent.  The fucking mean bird.  I'm telling you.  Yeah, the guy from, uh, Flight of the...  Opie, don't leave.  Is that who it is?  The guy from Flight of the Conchords.  I got a song if he wants.  Opie, E-Rock's got a song.  I'm a nice man.  Yeah!  Yeah, I'm a nice man. 
[00:37:30]  Yeah!  I didn't like that one either, huh?  Yeah, he's out of here.  But I got to take my mic back.  Sam Roberts on After Opie and Anthony Live.  Oh, he's gone.  He doesn't understand at this point that, like, him threatening you by saying tomorrow's  going to be a tough day for you, he's made it so that it has no effect on you anymore.  Every day's a tough day.  Yeah, what's it going to be that's any different?  Hey, guess what?  You're getting the same shit tomorrow.  Okay. 
[00:38:00]  Yeah.  That's not a surprise.  Uh, have...  Where's Bobo?  Uh, he was there for, like, 40 minutes.  What, did he give up?  He's not good enough?  Maybe he had to change buses.  Although I did, uh, get a Facebook message that he called this show The Shit Hour.  He said that, uh, for some reason, ONA would only let him back on The Shit Hour, which  is one of the reasons why.  He texted me, too, and he says, you told me to call, and I couldn't, uh, nobody was picking  up, and then I'm on hold.  I never, I don't talk to him.  Oh, here's what he said. 
[00:38:30]  The guy who Facebook messaged me, his name is Mike, uh, he said, uh, he is not Bobo's  friend, like Bobo said he was yesterday on the after show, and, uh, that he was absolutely  talking shit about Danny, and that he also said he can only get on The Shit Hour now,  which is not the name of this show.  However, I will say that, uh, he kind of redeemed himself today on ONA.  Um, let's play the clip, E-Rock, of us banning Bobo yesterday on the after show. 
[00:39:00]  This is what started this whole thing.  Bobo called in, and we talked to him, because he was talking shit about Danny at Foxwoods,  and he was saying that he was working on something that he wasn't, with E-Rock, and so, I mean,  he was lying, and he paid the cost.  This is Bobo on the after show yesterday.  We'll deal with the Danny thing at some point, I'll get you to admit it, but...  I never said anything about that.  E-Rock is saying that this worst of featuring Bobo, that he's, that that was a total fabrication. 
[00:39:30]  All right, I may, that I might have misheard something, all right?  Mishheard.  Yeah, but the thing about Danny, I never said...  Dreamt.  Listen, Bobo, until, until you can not make things up about the show, uh, I just got a note from, actually, from,  um, wow, actually, from way up top, from one of the presidents of this company.  Are you serious?  Okay.  Until you cannot lie and make things up about the show, it's now become a liability issue. 
[00:40:00]  We're gonna have to ban you from the show until, you know.  No, no, no, come on.  No, we're gonna have to.  Sorry, buddy.  How long?  How long?  Look, uh, six months, but I'll see if I can shorten it.  What, they suspended me for six months?  Yeah.  Sorry, buddy.  No, no, come on, come on.  Look, we'll work it out, Bobo.  Good riddance, asshole.  Don't say that, Troy.  Everything will be fine, all right, Bobo? 
[00:40:30]  They didn't really do that, all right?  I want proof.  I want to see.  All right, we'll send you something, buddy.  Get a hobby.  Don't.  A riddance statement.  Okay, I'll send you a riddance statement.  I'll send you a riddance statement, right?  All right.  See you later, Bobo.  After ONA, it's live.  I had to hang up on him because he just...  That drives me nuts.  What does?  No, no, no, no.  It's like, I'll do this, I'll do that.  It's like, what did we do...  I don't know.  When we first...  Since we first met him...  Yeah.  What did we do that made him feel entitled to everything that the staff has, that the 
[00:41:00]  show hosts have, like, that he's a part of this?  Yeah.  Somewhere along the way, Bobo decided that he is not a guest on the show, but a member  of the show.  Yeah.  He's to be allowed on the show at least once a week, and there's some crime against nature  when we say, Bobo, we're taking a rest from Bobo right now.  And none of the other, and I don't want to compare all these people to Bobo, but none  of the other, I'll say, extras from the show, like Pat and Big A and Patty, none of them 
[00:41:30]  feel that they're entitled to be here.  When they want to come up, they ask.  They have fun up here.  And, you know, of course, we do stuff with them, but Bobo is the only one that when he's  like, I'm coming up Friday...  He doesn't even ask.  I'm coming up Friday.  We see the others, like, every few months.  Yeah.  We just kind of splash them in, and, you know, just to get a taste of it, and everybody enjoys  it, and that way the next time, everybody still enjoys it, but Bobo insists...  But I'll bring donuts.  And he also thinks that he's such a multifaceted performer that he needs to come in with something 
[00:42:00]  new every time.  However, he did.  He said he took this into his own hands.  He took destiny into his own hands.  He didn't accept that I had gotten a message from above, obviously, that he was suspended  from the show.  He was...  Actually, I said banned.  He said he was suspended as if he was an employee.  Did you see the Twitter yesterday?  I don't look at his Twitter.  It was nonstop demanding that Opie actually respond to one of his Twitters.  He was calling this building.  Sorry. 
[00:42:30]  And he was calling...  He talked to the morning mashup office phone.  He was calling our office phone until at least 4.30 in the afternoon.  He called the talent department.  He was calling Liam the talent booker on his office phone and cell phone number.  It was insane the way he was fighting to get back on the show, and he decided to call  in anyway.  And he randomly did this.  It was hilarious, but this was all concocted in his imagination.  He decided to get on the bus, the public bus, with people on their way to work, and do Bobo, 
[00:43:00]  the one-man band.  He did it on today's show.  You'll be able to hear the whole thing when we replay at 3 p.m. Eastern time today, right  here on XM 105, Sirius 206.  That sounds weird.  What's that?  That's the channels we're on now.  Oh.  But this is it.  A little taste of Bobo from earlier this morning, playing Bobo, the one-man band.  Something that he thought up of.  He didn't think of the bit itself, but he decided to call in from the bus, and this is it. 
[00:43:30]  The insane Bobo on the bus.  After ONA Live.  You want to sing your dick song?  I love your dick song.  Yeah, yes.  Did he just call from the bus randomly?  Yeah.  Yes.  Yeah.  Dude, you just called from the bus and decided to do this?  Yep.  Jesus Christ.  I just thought, where's a good place to do this, and this is where I decided to do it.  All right.  That's insane.  You want to wrap up with your dick song?  I think they need to hear the big hit. 
[00:44:00]  All right.  You didn't sing the song, though. 
[00:44:30]  You're scared to sing the dick song?  Well, on this bus, I might get it thrown out, but I played, that's the instrumental version.  Yeah, we know that.  Yeah, we know the instrumental.  I'm very familiar with it.  All right, then maybe God bless America, and then we can move on.  Yeah, because this can only, the longer we do this, it's going to go wrong.  Of course.  This is going to be the one we look back on and go, why didn't we cut it after nine songs?  That horn is so bad. 
[00:45:00]  We're just trying to get to work at a quarter to eight in the morning, and this... 
[00:45:30]  You knew he was going with that, right?  Oh, yeah.  It's America!  I guess that's it.  That was it.  He's gone.  Yeah.  They probably threw the phone out the window.  With him holding it, I hope.  After ONA, it's live.  So that was Bobo redeeming himself. 
[00:46:00]  Picture yourself on a bus on the way to work, and that's what you hear.  Bobo marching up and down the seats with an air horn and a kazoo.  Bobo, you're back on the show.  Yeah, I know.  I just did that with the one-man bail.  I had to be on that bus anyway, but I feel like...  Bobo, I got to tell you, you did a good job for once of taking destiny into your own hands  and coming up with something, but why do you insist? 
[00:46:30]  On calling my show, The Shit Hour.  I did not do that, all right?  Now, see, you're lying.  I don't even have the rights to that nickname, all right?  Who does?  Who does?  I think Jim Norton, you give credit to that one.  What?  He has a good show on The Boneyard.  Yeah, but he's the one...  No, I mean, you're a show, right?  He's the one who called it that.  Listen, Bobo, I want you to know that because of what you did today, calling in and doing 
[00:47:00]  that bit.  Yeah.  This is strictly probationary.  All right.  But as of right now...  Yeah.  You're back on the show, Bobo.  Thank you guys.  Is it just me?  I'm not applauding that.  Nobody else is either, huh?  Well, Bobo, I mean, it is a probationary basis.  This could be stripped at any time. 
[00:47:30]  He didn't listen to you yesterday when you banned him.  He did a great job, though.  He did a great job today.  But he blatantly disrespected...  Yeah, but he provided good on-air content.  The rules you laid down.  Bobo, I didn't lay them down.  They came from above.  But Bobo, congratulations.  Thank you, Sam.  Thank you.  Now, what I want you to do is spend the rest of the day calling everybody that you called  yesterday who works here and letting them know that Sam Roberts has let you back on 
[00:48:00]  the show.  All right.  No problem.  All right, buddy.  I'll talk to you soon.  All right.  I've got to go see the optometrist.  I'm getting new glasses.  Transition lenses.  Transition lenses?  You dog.  Yeah, exactly.  They're going to be the glasses that we see in the...  All right, Bobo.  That's enough from Bobo.  But that kid stays on top of fashion.  Transition lenses.  Stay tuned.  The best of Ron and Fez is coming up next.  And it will be the very best of Ron and Fez. 
[00:48:30]  But after Opie and Anthony live and ONA, we'll be back live tomorrow.  Is Roland wanting to add something real quick?  Real quick, buddy.  You got something?
