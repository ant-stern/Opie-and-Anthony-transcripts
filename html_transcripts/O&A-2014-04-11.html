<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a pre-show hosted by Sam Roberts.  Key discussion points included Stephen Colbert's appointment to *Late Night*, sparking debate on the lack of diversity in the selection process; Anthony’s bizarre and humorous review of the *Roots* miniseries;  backlash against Nancy Grace’s commentary on wrestler deaths; and Opie's anger at Sean Hannity's labeling of him as a liberal.  A caller, Todd, criticized Opie's sensitivity to online criticism, leading to a discussion of Opie’s inflated Twitter following. Cousin Brucie made a surprise appearance, mentioning an upcoming guest, Dave Clark of The Dave Clark Five.  Dave Attell was in studio, contributing to conversations about aging and comedy.  Bobo's antics, including sending a picture of himself in his underwear for event tickets, were also discussed.  Opie surprisingly revealed a positive experience with Obamacare, contrasting with his previous criticisms.  The pre-show concluded with the announcement that Dan Soder would be a guest on the main show.

The main show began with discussions about one host's leashed cat, Beavis, transitioning into anecdotes about past pets, including a cat named Velcro who brought them dead chipmunks. This led to a discussion about the dangers of letting pets roam free, prompting reminiscences about a dangerous childhood home on 25A, including near-fatal car accidents and their father's involvement in rescuing people from accidents on the same road, ultimately resulting in his own death there.  The conversation then shifted to the upcoming guest, Dan Soder, and the show's lack of pre-show planning, compared to other, more structured radio shows.  Recent interviews with Danny Trejo, Iron Sheik, and Bob Saget were mentioned.  They briefly discussed a book about "discovering whiteness" and news clips involving violence.  Further discussion about Nancy Grace's commentary on Ultimate Warrior's death ensued, along with promotion for sponsors, and extensive coverage of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony, focusing on Nirvana, Kiss, Hall & Oates' performances, lengthy acceptance speeches, Linda Ronstadt's absence, and a humorous comparison of a photo of a chubby Linda Ronstadt to Bob Kelly.  A clip of Debbie Irving discussing her book, "Waking Up White," on MSNBC was played.

A substantial portion of the show focused on race and white privilege, sparked by a book by "Debbie Broad" discussing racial identity. The hosts and callers expressed skepticism and disagreement with the book's premise.  A white male caller from Indiana recounted his experiences working hard without perceived white privilege. A police officer caller described his experience with racial sensitivity training. The conversation also touched upon media portrayals of crime based on race and overcompensation for past injustices.  Comedian Colin Quinn called in, contributing to the discussion about the limits of humor regarding race. A clip of "Debbie Broad" discussing the "right context" for racial humor was played, sparking further debate.  A humorous segment about the cinnamon challenge featuring E-Rock was included.  The discussion concluded with further commentary on freedom of speech and political correctness. Dan Soder joined the show in studio.  Nancy Grace and the Ultimate Warrior's death were briefly discussed again.

A significant segment heavily featured a discussion about a Nancy Grace segment on wrestlers who died young, with Diamond Dallas Page (DDP) as a studio guest. They dissected Grace’s claims, mocking her lack of knowledge and using offensive language to describe her.  Crude humor, discussions of steroid use, and graphic descriptions of wrestler deaths were prominent.  A tangent about bringing baby bears onto the show occurred, interspersed with commercials. Dan Soder's upcoming appearances on Conan and Guy Code were mentioned.  The segment ended mid-discussion of Nancy Grace.

The show included numerous advertisements (Verimax Prostate Formula, SurePayroll, AdamandEve.com, Smoke Remedy, CreditRepair.com). A segment with Dr. Steve from "Weird Medicine" discussed zombies. A "Porn Chat" call connected the hosts to Jenna Jameson, who discussed personal issues.  A lengthy discussion about Nancy Grace, steroid use in wrestling, and bodybuilders' appearances followed.  A critical analysis of a poorly-made YouTube music video, "Summer is Great," dominated a significant portion, focusing on the family's appearance and production quality;  a caller suggested it was a Jimmy Kimmel prank.  Music from Anal Cunt's "Picnic of Love" album was played, compared to the "Summer is Great" video.  Listener calls were taken, and Dan Soder remained a studio guest.

A comedically disastrous read of a Sherry's Berries commercial, with Opie's improvisational, inappropriate commentary, was followed by a discussion of Bill Burr's ad reads and the nature of comedic honesty amongst certain comedians, using Burr and Bobby Kelly as examples.  The show concluded with a post-show segment featuring Sam Roberts and Dan Soder, discussing professional wrestling, Wrestlemania, and their experiences within the wrestling culture, including listener calls and commercials.

With Sam Roberts.  Oh, yeah.  Welcome, welcome.  Welcome to the O.P. & Anthony pre-show.  866-WOW-1-WOW.  If you call now, 866-969-1969. 
[00:01:30]  You, too, can be a part of the O.N.A. pre-show.  We do this every morning for just about 30 minutes.  Counting down until O.P. & Anthony hit the airwaves.  Talk about everything that's going to go down on today's show.  Recap everything that went down on yesterday's show.  And let's be honest.  When it comes to most things, the pre is sometimes the best part.  So, a lot of people enjoy the pre-show. 
[00:02:00]  Be a part of it.  866-WOW-1-WOW.  866-969-1969.  Of course, the big news in entertainment right now is that Stephen Colbert is going to be the host of Late Night.  This is news that just broke after we got off the air yesterday.  And I'm anxious to see what O.N.A. think of it.  Of course, the question that's on a lot of people's minds is how is it going to be with Stephen Colbert not being in character? 
[00:02:30]  Because it's not a mock political show anymore.  It's an actual show show.  It's the Late Night show.  The other thing that I want Opie and Anthony to get into, because I'd really like to hear their take on this,  is the fact that so many people are upset about the Stephen Colbert decision.  And I was talking, Pete Dominick does a show here on SiriusXM.  And he used to be the warm-up comedian for Colbert.  And so he was doing the rounds, you know, the talking head news shows yesterday. 
[00:03:00]  And he was telling me before, earlier this morning, that everybody's asking him about why wasn't a female asked to host the show?  Why wasn't a minority asked to be the host of the show?  And it's like we're forgetting that Stephen Colbert has proven himself as a TV show host.  I don't understand it.  I don't understand why it has to go there.  But I am anxious to hear what O.N.A.'s take is on that specific element of this whole process. 
[00:03:30]  Let's start this morning's pre-show, the big Friday pre-show before the bigger Friday show with Chris in Tennessee.  Oh, good morning, Sam.  What's up, buddy?  I just wanted to call and say hello.  That's about it.  And hopefully the Ron and Sam show will start next week.  Oh, my management team has not been given any formal offers yet. 
[00:04:00]  Oh, please, give you a shitload of money and just kick you into that next seat.  Please, come on now.  We all want it.  Thank you very much, Chris.  Always a pleasure.  Always a pleasure.  Have a good day, sir.  And I'm quite sure that's the first time I've spoken to him.  So, I will say, always a pleasure.  Now, yesterday's show was a very fun show.  You know, we're talking about what O.N.A.'s take is going to be on the most topical news story there is right now, the Stephen Colbert deal.  But the thing about O.N.A. is they have this knack for taking something that nobody's thought about in years 
[00:04:30]  and putting it into a whole new context so that it's entertaining again.  Anthony spent his Wednesday night watching Roots, which, if you know Anthony, I guess is not that huge of a surprise.  There wasn't enough racial coverage going on in the news, I guess, on Wednesday.  So, he had to put Roots on.  But what I thought, I mean, it was just so amusing was Ant's take on Roots in 2014. 
[00:05:00]  He came in yesterday and gave his full review on the complete miniseries.  This is Ant's opinion of Roots.  The original Roots.  I was watching that, and it's like six parts.  Right.  And it was a miniseries on television back in 1977, and so it goes a little fast because you don't have all those commercials.  But holy fuckaroni, what they got away with back in 1977 as far as language went, wow. 
[00:05:30]  Really?  And all your favorites.  I mean, I'm sitting there watching.  First, you got the father, the father from the Waltons.  He goes with Lou Grant on a ship to Africa.  And they pick up LaForge, who's also the Reading Rainbow guy.  Right.  But then O.J. is trying to get Reading Rainbow guy to hook up with his daughter.  O.J. was in that?  O.J.  I don't remember that.  I don't remember O.J. in that. 
[00:06:00]  They come back, and they sell, the guy that's selling LaForge from Star Trek The Next Generation is Sosa from fucking Scarface.  Ah.  It's Sosa.  Sosa.  So he sells him, he sells LaForge to Ben Cartwright from Bonanza.  Really?  Whose brother is fucking his wife, and his brother is Mr. Brady from the Brady Bunch. 
[00:06:30]  Irony of them all.  And then the guy from Rat Patrol, Vic Morrow, is a real prick.  He starts whipping him, but then the sergeant from Officer and a Gentleman befriends him.  Wait, Lou Gossett, right?  It was fantastic.  And they're all dropping in bombs.  It's fantastic.  Do you remember when they're on their way over, and the guy says to Ed Astor, do you want a belly warmer?  Do you want a belly warmer?  He sends in a black chick as a belly warmer.  That's the best description of Roots ever.  It was fantastic.  That could go viral, sir.  That one could go viral. 
[00:07:00]  Oh, you forgot when the girl with the glass eye got her beverage spat in.  Whoopsie.  Whoopsie.  I think Obie's right in terms of going viral.  I think that I would watch, if Anthony put out like a YouTube series or something, where  he just reviews movies that are 25 to 35 years old, I think I would watch that, because I  found myself very entertained by that.  Honest to God.  It made me want to go home and watch Roots. 
[00:07:30]  Now, once I got home, I remembered that it's Roots, and it's 2014.  I'm not actually going to go home and watch Roots.  But in that moment, when Ant was breaking it down, I wanted to go home and watch the  entire miniseries again.  I didn't, but it made me want to do it.  He went on to talk about Vic Morrow and Robert Reed, and since Robert Reed was involved, he  did get some help from Jim Norton.  And Vic Morrow is, boy, can he play a great prick. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah.  Your name's Toby.  Now tell me your name.  Quinta Quinte.  And then he just, he tips his head to another black guy, like, okay, give him a few more.  He's whipping him.  What's your name?  And then he finally goes, Toby.  And broke him.  I think the black guys on set looked at Vic Morrow like, you mother effer.  It's like, you're not acting.  It's like, you're either the greatest actor in the world.  Or you're the biggest racist ever.  The most unbelievable part of the whole thing, though, was watching Mr. Brady seduce a woman 
[00:08:30]  in an open field as he's taking her top off and making that yuck face.  Exactly.  He didn't know what to do.  He's just putting things over her breasts.  You know what he did?  He curled his hand up by her groin and tried to put his mouth over something.  And he put it on her hands and knees and said, I need a bucket of lawn.  And he tried to green it.  It's just disgusting.  And it's quite frankly disrespectful.  That's not like the O.B. and Anthony show. 
[00:09:00]  Let's see what's going on with you guys.  Lou in Jersey.  What's up, Lou?  Hey, good morning, Sammy.  Good morning.  I was wondering if you guys were going to get into what Nancy Grace had to say  about the Ultimate Warrior and all the wrestlers' deaths.  I think it's disgusting.  And I love how Cancel Nancy Grace was hashtagging.  It was trending last night on Twitter.  Yeah, I really hope so.  Because Nancy Grace talked to Diamond Dallas Page, of all people,  about the death of the Ultimate Warrior. 
[00:09:30]  And then she ran through.  She kind of bombarded him about steroids, even though we don't know.  I mean, look, there's no doubt that at some point the Ultimate Warrior used steroids.  But, as of today, I don't know what killed this dude.  It was very strange and sudden.  So she bombards Diamond Dallas Page with questions about wrestlers using steroids.  And then she puts up a scroll on the TV screen of all these wrestlers that died young,  implying that they died because of steroids. 
[00:10:00]  One of the names was Owen Hart.  And I don't care.  You could be drug-free.  When you get dropped from the ceiling of an arena, that's going to do it to you.  It doesn't matter whether he was on steroids or not.  I don't think that's what did him in.  Sensationalizing death.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But so all the wrestling fans then turned around and started this Cancel Nancy Grace hashtag  that's actually picking up some buzz.  It's on a whole bunch of news sites and everything this morning.  Hopefully, ONA will get into it.  Because even though, you know, we talked about the Cancel Colbert campaign, which just makes 
[00:10:30]  this whole thing of Colbert moving to late night even better.  All those Cancel Colbert people.  Can you imagine watching somebody who you were campaigning to get thrown off TV being raised  up?  I mean, there couldn't be a better promotion for this guy.  But I think if there's one person that Opie and Anthony would support the cancellation  of on television, it would have to be Nancy Grace.  Hopefully, they'll get into that.  They got into another newsmaker yesterday. 
[00:11:00]  Sean Hannity.  Sean Hannity had some comments about Opie and Anthony, but Opie specifically.  And we got to see some of the anger that Opie has left behind recently when he talked about  Sean Hannity.  This is, let's start with track six and Opie reading his tweet that he tweeted out about  Sean Hannity two days ago.  I handled it just as well as you on Twitter yesterday. 
[00:11:30]  Oh.  Hey, Sean Hannity, stop the bullshit.  I'm not even close to a liberal.  Never voted in my life, which includes Obama.  I hate liars.  Wow.  That's probably unnecessarily harsh.  That comes across, though, like, especially Obama, I hate liars, it comes across like  you're calling Obama a liar.  I understood that.  That's not the only thing you wrote.  Ah, good one.  I was calling them both liars.  Ah.  That's not the only thing you wrote.  Well, then I wrote, dickheads with no brains think if you're not a right-wing nut, you're  automatically a liberal.  They're unfamiliar with the middle or independent.  Right-wing nut, though. 
[00:12:00]  You use that, it makes you come off like a lip.  I understand.  So, dickheads with no brains, that's probably not a good way to start a conversation.  And I brought up that tweet again later in the show.  Just because the phrase dickheads with no brains is, to me, hilarious.  It's one of the greatest insults you can give somebody.  Not only are you brainless, but you're also a dickhead.  You just don't hear people being called dickheads enough.  Let's go straight to what the clip was that got Opie so ticked off yesterday. 
[00:12:30]  Let's go to track eight and Sean Hannity describing Opie as a liberal.  Opie and Anthony, they're on Sirius Satellite Radio.  Yeah, we got along.  Thank you, Sean.  We got along.  A little plug-a-rooney.  Yes, a very nice plug.  He couldn't get in the city after 9-11 or on 9-11.  We broadcasted that day, right?  And he couldn't either, so we found studios in Garden City, the old, I don't know if they're still around, L-I-R or D-R-E, whatever the hell they're called.  I have no idea if they're still in business, but we found their studios, and they were nice enough to let us broadcast that day, and Sean was there as well. 
[00:13:00]  Yeah.  I don't know why we hit it off.  I mean, for all intents and purposes, I mean, they do a wild, wacky morning show, afternoon show.  And that bothers me.  I'm going to stop this a lot.  That bothers me, too.  We are more than just wacky.  We always were more than just wacky.  But that's his descriptor.  That's Sean's.  That's like him saying, ah, they're a little nutty. 
[00:13:30]  Right, right, right.  That's just the way Sean talks.  That is the way he talks.  I think some of the things he does is wacky.  And as a casual observer back in the day, I don't think people were really on to the fact that we were talking about a lot of different things.  But between all the, I mean.  With the publicity we got, we did come off as wacky.  Yeah, but in between all those crazy stunts and the nudity, we certainly were doing other things.  But, you know, when you look back, those are the, what are you going to do?  I know.  Maybe the 9-11 show, maybe.  But all the other serious conversations we had over the years, eh. 
[00:14:00]  Overshadowed by.  Overshadowed by teen girls eating each other.  Right.  Okay.  And to him, by the way, calling somebody wacky is not akin with calling somebody a bag of shit.  Like, to us, it is.  To this show, being called wacky, it's like, oh, fuck it.  Of course.  But to him, he's saying that.  That just means kind of out there.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  The intent of the user is not to be a dick.  And, you know, I do a more news-oriented program.  Anyway, on 9-11, neither one of us could get into our studios in New York City.  I already said this. 
[00:14:30]  So, we met in the hall.  Can I just say this?  Yeah, he did.  I was expecting a wipe there, but that's okay.  Let's go straight to Todd in Burlington.  What's up, Todd?  Big Sammy, this is Todd.  Best friends with Superfan Eric.  How you doing?  Oh, good.  How are you, Todd?  I'm good.  Listen, it's obvious, though.  Opie is always trying to make his persona out there in the world, you know, himself look great. 
[00:15:00]  And the minute somebody takes a jab at him, he just turns into a baby and starts whining about it.  Why can't he take a good ribbing just like he can dish out?  Well, I will say, in Opie's defense, he has taken some shots in that studio.  When he brings in, like, old radio tapes or when he uploads Real Rock TV or something like that,  he will take some shots.  I think there are just certain triggers, and everybody has little things that just irritate them. 
[00:15:30]  And I think Sean Hannity just hit Opie in a spot that really irritated him.  I can feel it.  But what about his Twitter followers?  Have you noticed he has, like, 300,000 and 200,000 of those are little eggs?  Well, you know what happened?  I think, thank you, Todd.  I think that the same person who probably got, you know, Bobo and Lady Di a bunch of followers  got Opie a bunch of followers because he told me, he was like, he texted me around the same time 
[00:16:00]  it was happening to Bobo and Lady Di.  Like, dude, I just got 100,000 followers out of nowhere.  There's some mystery man who's buying followers for the people associated with this show.  It's a very, very strange thing.  We were talking about Twitter yesterday, actually.  Let's move to track seven.  And the conversation about why one would argue on Twitter came up.  Just looking at Twitter.  Oh.  Why?  No reason.  Why would you do that?  Why would you do that? 
[00:16:30]  I barely look.  I look every fucking day.  Here's a video.  I'm selling a shirt.  And here's us with a celebrity.  Bye.  That's what it's become now.  I had jumped back into the racial discussion fray of late.  And then it just always turns into a rehashing of the Trayvon and Zimmerman thing.  And it's like, that's done.  Enough already.  Then I get roped in.  You do get roped in, huh?  I get roped in and start going off on it.  Because people just, they're deniers of fact. 
[00:17:00]  And you just want to set them straight.  And a lot of times I do use some people as a means to an end.  You know, it's easier for me to answer something to discuss it than it would be to just throw it out there as a here.  It's better to just answer somebody else's statement with something.  But why would you argue with people that, you know, obviously don't like you or your stance and you know you'll never turn them?  I can't be bothered with that anymore.  I know there's people out there that simply don't like me. 
[00:17:30]  And I'm like, why am I arguing with these people?  They're never going to like me.  I could cure cancer and they would find a problem with that.  I think it's because I can get my word out there.  I can get my opinion out there.  I can get another discussion started maybe with people that, you know, are a little more adept to debating.  But in order to get it started, I need that jumping off point.  And sometimes it's some asshole with two followers that, you know.  That makes sense.  It's giving shit. 
[00:18:00]  That certainly makes sense.  It's addicting though.  The problem is Twitter's addicting because they're right.  There's no reason that a lot of the people that are on Twitter should have the kind of access that they do to people like Opie and Anthony.  But there is this thing that you just want, especially Opie and Anthony are combative people.  Okay.  They like to argue.  So there's this thing that when they see something on Twitter that they don't think is right, the natural inclination is to attack, attack. 
[00:18:30]  And then you just get stuck, sucked into this vortex where you're arguing with people on the Internet for absolutely no reason.  Later on, on today's Opie and Anthony show, Dan Soder will be in studio.  Jim is in Tampa, I believe, doing a little stand-up comedy.  So Dan Soder will be in a little later.  He's always good on the O&A show.  Yesterday, we had a big guest.  And I don't mean Dave Attell.  Dave Attell was in studio and he was a big guest.  But I'm referring to our surprise guest. 
[00:19:00]  When the cousin stopped by, yes, ladies and gentlemen, Cousin Brucie, as a nice surprise, poked his head into the Opie and Anthony studio yesterday.  It's so weird that Cousin Brucie is just walking around this place at all odd hours of the day.  He's here at Saturday night.  He's here Thursday morning.  And this is what happened when he was here yesterday morning.  Cousin Bruce Mara.  There he is.  Cousin Brucie.  Cousin Brucie.  Wow.  We got a real interesting thing. 
[00:19:30]  What do you got?  What do you got?  Get on mic.  Dave Clark is coming on.  Dave Clark of the Dave Clark Five.  Dave Clark Five.  It's not a Dave Clark Three.  It might not be on my PBS special.  Yeah.  By the way, you guys look ugly.  Isn't that why we all got into radio, Cousin?  That's it.  You're right.  Really nice to see you.  I'm so happy to share this floor with you guys.  Always good to see Cousin Brucie.  I've got to get to Cousin Dive.  Oh, is that what you get?  Dive.  Dive.  Hi, Lauren.  How are you doing?  Maybe sometime we come in and let's do a little.  Yeah, let's do something.  It's been a while. 
[00:20:00]  Yes, indeed, Brucie.  Brucie doesn't age.  You look great.  You sound good.  Thank you.  I want to come in one night and sit in on the show with you.  Let me know what it happens so I can get the door locked.  Are you kidding me?  I can't afford to do what you guys do.  Are you kidding me?  No.  What do I do?  I better buy insurance.  When do you come in?  I'll have insurance.  Okay.  You know, Dirty Dancing was on the other day and I heard you at the beginning of that  and in the middle doing some stuff there.  And I play the magician.  Yes, the magician.  That is residuals for my grandkids.  Nice.  Nice.  Anyway, I'll see you guys.  All right.  Cousin Brucie, have a great day, man. 
[00:20:30]  I'm really proud to share this floor with you.  Absolutely.  Cousin Brucie, we're honored.  A legend in the business right there.  A tip of the hat.  There he goes.  Thank you, Cousin Brucie.  Here it is.  Take it easy.  That's amazing.  I think he was at JFK when the Beatles landed.  Right there.  He's one of those guys.  Right there at Idlewild.  How old is he?  He looks fucking great.  He must have that stuff just in his closet that's worth millions of dollars.  A million.  Oh, Bobby Darin's inhaler?  Sure.  He left it at the funny story.  He left it at the studio.  Inhaler.  Sammy Davis' real eye? 
[00:21:00]  Yeah, here it is.  He gave it to me as a gift.  And formaldehyde.  So great.  I'm also glad that Cousin Brucie, his hearing isn't what it used to be.  Because I'll be saying that the five has been moved down to three.  Not exactly kind.  Let's go to Andrew in Jersey.  What's up, Andrew?  Hey, Cousin Sam.  How you doing?  Good, Cousin Andrew.  Hey, can we get the Marion call out of the way early in the show?  It's too late now, but...  Yeah, no, I'm glad you called.  Because so far, we have not heard from Marion. 
[00:21:30]  Which I guess is a blessing for all of us.  But Marion, who's been calling into the pre-show pretty much every day this week,  has not yet called in to explain why Lady Di should get a ticket to Unmasked.  Of course, Marion, Lady Di and Bobo all placed on the Bobo list.  Which means they're not welcome at next Thursday's Unmasked with Ron Bennington.  And the unmasking of Opie and Anthony.  Snowy in Michigan, you're on the pre-show. 
[00:22:00]  Thanks, sweet baby Jesus.  We haven't heard from her today.  That's right.  Speaking of which, don't those dingbats realize the more they complain about not getting tickets,  the less likely they're going to get a ticket?  No, they are.  They're dingbats, Snowy, in every sense of the word.  They don't realize that whatsoever.  You could hear that yesterday Bobo called up because I was sent some screen grabs of some  texts that some listener sent him pretending to be a woman and saying that if Bobo had sex 
[00:22:30]  with this woman and her husband, he could have tickets to Unmasked, Bobo agreed to be penetrated  anally while receiving a blowjob and then took a photo of his crotch with panties on and  sent them to this person who in turn sent them to me.  Now Bobo has a deep history of doing this with people pretending to be women. 
[00:23:00]  He's given out his Twitter password countless times to people who pretend to be women.  He's a bumbling fool and there is no way that he's sitting there thinking to himself,  well, if I just leave it alone, maybe I have a better shot at getting tickets.  You could hear it in his voice yesterday when he called up the show literally begging for  these Unmasked tickets.  Let's go to track 14, Sal.  Yes.  They sent us a picture of you wearing panties.  Bobo, you're wearing pink Let's Go Mets panties. 
[00:23:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  You didn't sound too happy about that.  So explain yourself.  Yeah, I was too thrilled about that.  I only did that for her, but I trusted her.  She wasn't going to make these pictures public.  Bobo, it's not a her.  It's a guy.  Right.  This is a guy.  And stop trusting these people.  Stop fucking around on the internet.  How many times are you going to get tricked?  I'm not going to get tricked again.  We won't get fooled again.  Fool me once, shame on you.  Fool me twice. 
[00:24:00]  You won't get fooled again.  What if you fool him several dozen times?  Right.  Yeah, well, I won't get fooled again.  He doesn't even care.  No.  All right.  Obviously, you don't want to go down mass, so we've got to move on.  Thank you.  I do want to go down mass.  I do want to go.  I do want to go, guys.  We're losing here.  We can't hear you, Bobo.  Yeah, well, I do want to go.  We can't hear you.  Hello?  I guess he doesn't want to go.  If he wanted to go, we'd hear him.  Yeah, we felt bad about the panties, and we were just going to give him tickets. 
[00:24:30]  But if we can't hear the guy, what are we going to do?  Obviously, if he wanted to go, he would have stayed on the phone.  He hung up on us.  Bobo!  Bobo!  He hung up.  He hung up.  We have one extra ticket, but we also have a pair of O&A panties.  Should I just send the panties to Bobo?  Yeah, I feel bad that he had to wear the panties, so I was going to turn around and just give  him the tickets and be done with this, but he's not even on the phone.  Why would he hang up?  I'm on the phone.  Right before we give him tickets, he hangs up like that?  That's fucked up.  I'm on the phone, guys. 
[00:25:00]  Very funny.  You guys are going to mess with me, buddy.  All right, I just...  You're going to mess with me, right?  Very funny.  You guys are going to mess with me, right?  Bobo came off of that phone call texting Sal.  I still don't know how he got Sal's phone number, but he...  Did you give it to him?  I think I did.  Oh, why would you do that?  Sal thinks he gave his phone number to Bobo.  You never do that.  He was texting Sal and saying that his mother wanted to call the show because Bobo wanted 
[00:25:30]  tickets.  Bobo is, I believe, 33 years old.  Something like that.  He's in his early 30s.  He thinks that his mother calling will help to get him shows.  He wrote, my mom wants to call because she feels sad that O&A act like I do not want  the tickets.  She wants them to stop pretending I hung up on them.  Well, if it's Bobo's mom, I guess we can make an exception.  Good Lord.  A lot to get into on today's Opie and Anthony show.  As I said, Dan Soder will be in studio with us. 
[00:26:00]  There was an author on MSNBC who wrote a book about discovering her whiteness.  And it's all about figuring out white privilege.  I think it's going to drive the guys crazy.  So I'm sure they'll get into that audio.  The Nancy Grace thing, of course, we talked about and Hillary Clinton getting a shoe thrown  at her.  We have the video.  We will watch it together as a family.  Now, you heard in that Cousin Brucie clip, Dave Attell in studio.  He was hilarious once again. 
[00:26:30]  We got into a whole bunch of stuff with him, including the problems with different ages.  Let's go to track 15.  I realize that I've hit that point now where it's like, you know, I'm so old now.  Like I watch the younger comics and their talk, their rants and all that stuff.  What bothers them?  Like something like an email will bother them, you know, and like I find that like really  hilarious.  You know, for me, it's like a smell I can't I can't describe, you know, something like 
[00:27:00]  that.  Like, what is that?  Is that like peanut butter or or is that like the first stage of diabetes?  What is that?  My urine shouldn't smell like that.  It's funny how they, you know, they teched it up, these kids, and they all have their,  you know, whatever their podcasts and whatnot.  Oh, yeah.  The kids have their podcasts.  I'm worried about what my piss smells like.  It's just a different generation.  It's different.  I don't know.  Andrew in Michigan. 
[00:27:30]  Welcome to the pre-show.  Welcome to the pre-show.  Turn down your radio.  You there?  No.  You lost your opportunity.  Mike in Columbus.  Yeah.  Hi, Sam.  Love you.  Love the show.  Thanks, Mike.  I was wondering if anybody has an update for E-Rock and this movie script.  We haven't heard about a year ago, a year or more ago, we found out that E-Rock is working  on a film script.  I do not know that we have an update, but hopefully, you know, if things slow down a little bit, 
[00:28:00]  it's a big news day, but if things slow down on the show a little bit today, we can figure  out whether or not there's an update on the big E-Rock movie script.  I would assume that it's just about done, and I'm really looking forward to that.  But we have the bit ready to go and everything.  Now, we were talking about Dave Attell.  One of my favorite things that Dave Attell did yesterday was bringing up growing up on  Long Island.  I thought that was great when Opie, Anthony, and Dave Attell were all just talking about 
[00:28:30]  growing up.  We got this caller on the phone.  His name was Richie.  He was talking about robbing ice cream trucks.  Richie was one of my favorite parts of yesterday.  Let's hear how that went down.  We used to make it into the ice cream truck at night, and we don't talk about, forget  about it.  There's no limitation.  Yeah.  The one thing I was happy about was I didn't have diabetes.  That's all that.  Hey.  So let me ask you this. 
[00:29:00]  Would you, was that for just the fun of it, for the ice cream, or to resell the ice  cream on the street?  Yeah, yeah.  To, you know, down the road, like, you know.  The street value of a case of...  Out of the trunk ice cream.  I don't know if I would do that.  The street value of these ice cream sandwiches.  You want a frozen clock board?  What do you need?  You know, I didn't have much of an entrepreneurial spirit back then.  But I was kind of just in it for a while.  I'm not supposed to be doing this shit.  Yeah.  Hey, Jimmy, what kind of ice cream you got? 
[00:29:30]  How you doing?  You'd complain, but who'd listen?  This guy's always good for something.  A sandwich, an ice cream sandwich.  But what Jimmy really loved were ice cream trucks.  That's great, because any guy who drove an ice cream truck in the 70s and 80s, you knew  had pot, but would never give it to you because you weren't a chick.  Like, it was all like, that was like his thing.  Like, you know, hey, oh, your cousin's in the neighborhood.  You know, like, she got all the cool stuff.  Hey, you want to talk about forget about it? 
[00:30:00]  Like, what does that even mean?  Who would say that?  Richie is the man.  Yeah, Sal might say that, but only when he's around his mafia family, his connected family.  And I don't mean that to no disrespect, Sal.  I don't mean no disrespect by that.  Ah, big Opie and Anthony show to get to today.  Of course, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction went down yesterday.  There's a whole bunch of bootleg YouTube clips that are online, all the performances and the  kiss speech and everything. 
[00:30:30]  We'll probably get into some of that.  Hillary Clinton getting a shoe thrown at her.  The Nancy Grace wrestling fans wanting to get her canceled, which is so great.  And a whole bunch more.  Stephen Colbert taking over late night.  Dan Soder, hilarious comedian, always does well on ONA, stopping by the show later on  this morning.  Prepare for entertainment.  Prepare for greatness.  Because the Opie and Anthony show starts right now. 
[00:31:00]  On Opie and puedełam to the store.  The otherience�ん's expand by the world. նero  Japanese  We'll be more forcasting a lot. 
[00:31:30]  We'll play with you in your home.  It's so beautiful.  It's so great.  It's so great.  We'll see you in your actions.  We'll see you inสตans.  In all of the past, press the Wednesday night outside and exit.  We'll see you in the morning.  By the way, we'll watch most of you byấp 곳.  We'll see you in the morning and con‐dro brightness.  Thank you. 
[00:32:00]  Thank you. 
[00:32:30]  Thank you. 
[00:33:00]  Thank you. 
[00:33:30]  Thank you. 
[00:34:00]  Thank you. 
[00:34:30]  Thank you. 
[00:35:00]  Thank you. 
[00:35:30]  Thank you.  Friday.  I like to say TGIF.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know what it means, but people say it on Friday a lot.  Good morning.  Hi, everybody.  Good morning.  I'm working on my Arnold Schwarzenegger for everybody.  Good morning.  Is that good?  Not really. 
[00:36:00]  No.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Like that?  Yeah.  All right.  Morning.  Morning.  I figured now that I'm at the end of my radio career, I should start doing voices.  There you go.  Good morning.  Is that good?  Good morning.  Good morning.  Good morning.  That's a good one right there now.  Oh, Sam.  Young Sam.  Samwise Gamshi.  I already...  Hillary got a shoe thrown at her.  I know that already.  Yeah.  I know you do know that.  Why are you giving me a list of things I know already? 
[00:36:30]  Hillary Clinton has a shoe thrown at her.  Okay.  Well, no, Colbert had a show thrown at him.  She has a shoe thrown at him.  That's a good point.  Very different.  This Colbert thing.  God, we were all trying to figure out who's going to replace Letterman,  and no one in this room came up with Colbert.  No, I heard his name being vallied about early on,  right when David Letterman retires, announced his retirement.  Of course, all the names come out, and his wasn't one of them.  His was one.  But I don't know. 
[00:37:00]  I wouldn't have thought they would have gone with him.  But we obviously had a full discussion about this.  Now we've got to redo it for everybody.  Oh, here we go.  I'm trying to figure out how the Colbert thing is going to work.  Obviously, he has a huge fan base, and he does great for Comedy Central.  He's even better than Jon Stewart, and that was not supposed to happen.  Colbert was supposed to be kind of the throwaway after Jon Stewart.  Maybe keep some of his numbers, you know what I mean?  And he just blew the fuck up.  Jon Stewart's got to be pissed,  because I think Jon Stewart is associated with Letterman. 
[00:37:30]  He probably should have been given the Letterman's file.  I think back in the day, Jon Stewart had development deals for Worldwide Pants, right?  So I think they were sort of grooming him to be maybe the guy.  Back in the day, but then he cut out his own thing.  And then Colbert just explodes past Jon Stewart.  But here's my thought.  His show is heavy on politics. 
[00:38:00]  Now he moves that over to late night.  Obviously, he's not going to do the exact same show he did for Comedy Central.  So does he drop the schtick?  His pseudo-conservative talk show guy schtick?  Because all that is schtick.  It's all just a character.  But if he changes too much, then does he lose his base?  Right, because people don't really know him as him on his show.  So is he going to have the schtick with less politics?  I guess that's the angle he's got to take, right? 
[00:38:30]  Schtick with less politics.  Yeah, it's got to be entertainment.  It's got to be a typical late night talk show.  I guess because he does interviews on that show.  Right.  They assume he can do some interviews.  And then he's a funny guy.  Right.  He's a funny writer.  Right.  So they assume he can do bits, so there's your talk show.  Sure.  That's all it takes.  All that makes sense.  Yeah.  But, again, yeah, that's a character that he does.  A character like Mr. Amos.  So is he going to do the character, or does he kind of give a little more of his real self, 
[00:39:00]  which you see every once in a while in some of these interviews?  Yeah.  He said yesterday that he will not be doing it in character.  Right.  And that he'll be doing it as himself.  Wow.  I would assume that.  Really?  I would assume that.  You can't be a character on a real talk show.  Are people going to like that version of him as much as the character he did?  No, they're going to hate him.  I have no idea.  That's, you know, something to think about.  He could always dip into that character again.  And I'm sure he will. 
[00:39:30]  Yeah.  Huh.  Yeah, Sam and I were discussing it yesterday.  Right.  And we were both saying, we'll miss Stephen Colbert, the character.  Yeah.  Right.  Because there's no other character like that on television.  Right.  Well.  Huh.  I mean, he'll still be able to do, like, skits and things like that.  Where he could jump into that, and he will.  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah, maybe.  Characters like Mr. Imus.  What does this mean for the Stengel brothers?  That's all I care about.  Oh, shit.  Our pals.  They're so gone. 
[00:40:00]  Justin and Eric, are they all right?  Walking papers.  They got their shit worked out.  They got the next project already working.  Oh, yeah?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah?  Yeah, they're kind of developing some stuff for worldwide pants.  Some of that back burner shit?  Huh?  Oh, yeah.  They've been out.  They're bringing it on the front burner?  Yeah.  They've been out in Los Angeles.  Oh, shit.  Working on shit.  I did see them.  Yeah.  Wait, they're out there for good?  No.  But they're bi-coastal now.  Whoa.  That's right.  Bi-coastal.  Have you heard?  So they suck dick?  No. 
[00:40:30]  That's not bisexual.  Is that what that means?  No, that's different.  Oh, I thought that was code.  I thought that was the code.  Uh-huh.  No, that would be a terrible code.  Wow, that's the angle, bro.  That's so dick.  All right.  You know, that's good in 2014.  People don't have as much of a problem with that, so good for them for announcing their bi-coastalness.  Yeah.  Have you heard the Colbert criticism?  Mm-mm.  What is the big criticism?  That he doesn't like Asian people, or as he calls them, Orientals or whatever? 
[00:41:00]  No.  What?  Pete Dominic used to be Colbert's warm-up act.  Right.  And so he was doing the news shows, and this isn't the clip I'm looking for, but he told  me that a lot of them are complaining that CBS did not go for a woman or a minority.  Oh, that crap.  Yeah.  Enough with a woman or a minority.  First of all, you want a minority talk show?  Tune in in the afternoon.  They're all fucking minorities and women in afternoon fucking television.  Yeah, you don't see it.  So relax. 
[00:41:30]  Because that's when the broads are home watching.  That's when you bitches get a minute to sit on your ass and watch TV.  When the man's out working.  You get to sit there and watch Wendy Williams.  Right.  Ellen DeGeneres.  Ellen fucking...  Bethany for just a little longer because she sucks.  Bethany.  All your view shows and your fucking chew shows.  Exactly.  All that bitch shit that you love so much.  Late night is meant for men.  Late night's for men. 
[00:42:00]  Men, men, men, men, men, men, men, men, men.  People smart enough and knowledgeable enough to understand a monologue.  Preferably a white man.  Right.  But if you've got to throw a black in there once in a while, it's okay.  Like Arsenio doing so well that the New York market pushed him a half hour forward for  Seinfeld reruns.  And that's the show Leno decides to do a cameo on?  Yeah.  What the hell is that about?  I think Leno's... 
[00:42:30]  And didn't one of those George Lopez type guys do a late night show?  Yeah, he did.  How about that?  It didn't do well.  You have to step aside for the whole Conan thing.  Yeah, Conan gave him the kibosh.  Right.  Ah, shit.  I think if Conan got rid of the ginger look, he would do much better.  You think?  Oh, absolutely.  What should he do?  It's kind of hard for him to get rid of.  America's not ready for that yet.  I would think that's kind of hard for him to get rid of.  Why?  Just dye it out.  He doesn't just...  It's not just his hair.  He has like that whole look.  You're like, he can't dye his hair black. 
[00:43:00]  No.  And be like a black hair guy.  Well, he's got to just...  He's got to start losing hair.  And I'll tell you why.  Oh.  Because like Conan, I used to have a horrendous...  Cowlick.  Oh, boy.  And then you get a little older and your hair moves a little further back.  And it got rid of the cowlick.  It just got...  The cowlick fell out?  Yes.  I didn't know that happened.  I was pretty happy about that.  I bet.  So Colbert for Letterman. 
[00:43:30]  All right.  That's right.  We'll see what happens with that.  That's good.  Hmm.  I was thinking about my meeting with Barry yesterday.  Oh, you had a accountant meeting.  Yes.  Yeah, those are great.  Going after...  Doing financial stuff.  I love those financial meetings.  And talks about wills and all that creepy shit.  Well, you with a wife and two kids, you definitely are in that fucking boat where you have to... 
[00:44:00]  Yeah, but I'm from the school of, ah, let them figure it out if I'm gone.  I'm gone.  Who the fuck?  Ha, ha, ha, yeah.  Let's see who is the strong ones.  Right.  That could fight it out and figure it out.  Survival of the fittest.  I would love to do it that way.  Yeah.  And then Barry just loves talking about ghoulish things.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Anyway. 
[00:44:30]  He is just ghoulish with that stuff.  And then the health insurance thing came up.  Oh, it did, huh?  We kind of made headlines lately with the health...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  ...the Obamacare.  We're a little mad.  On a side note, I got a few texts from my brother Joe last night about his health care,  which got canceled and he had to get new ones, and now it's costing him a lot more for prescriptions and whatnot.  Yeah, and people don't think that's happening, but it is happening.  No, it's all lies.  And the website is a complete mess. 
[00:45:00]  Barry was saying the website is a complete...  He had to go on the website for Obamacare for his own daughter.  Yeah.  And he said his head exploded.  And he knows that world.  He knows that world.  He goes, it is a disaster.  I went through it.  If you have to go through the website to try to get your new health insurance.  I went through it just to check it out.  Right.  I went up to a certain point, you know?  Yeah.  And it was ridiculous what you have to do before you even get started.  Right.  With picking anything out.  Right.  The information that you've got to put in.  And didn't they fire the broad? 
[00:45:30]  Oh, no, she retired.  No.  She resigned.  She resigned.  That's it.  She's out sick is the headline.  What's her name?  Kathleen something?  I forgot her last name.  Sibelius or something?  Washington has quit her post having never recovered from the bungled rollout of Obamacare.  Yeah.  The department confirmed Thursday.  And Obama has already picked her successor.  Well, hopefully now the IRS woman goes and then Attorney General Holder goes. 
[00:46:00]  Hopefully we get all that.  Right.  So Barry's, you know, he's talking.  He's like, oh, I see you guys made, you know, headlines.  And you're calling for a revolution.  I'm like, a little bit.  A little bit.  It's a little revolution.  Sounds good on paper.  But if you hear the actual clip, it's kind of goofy.  Yeah.  And we're bitching and complaining that, you know, my health insurance got canceled and  I have to deal with this Obamacare.  And he goes, yep, you do.  And I figured out the numbers.  And yes, you have to slide into one of these Obamacare packages. 
[00:46:30]  I think I'm gold, by the way.  Nice.  I think gold is good, right?  Is there platinum?  Gold, platinum.  Wait, where am I platinum?  I don't know.  I don't even know if there's.  So after it was all said and done and he crunched the numbers and showed me what I'm now dealing with.  I'm saving money.  So.  What?  I didn't.  I'm saving money.  Anyway, so.  I heard money. 
[00:47:00]  What?  What was that?  I saved money.  Come on.  So.  All right.  Look.  Yes.  After all that and calling for a revolution, I'm actually going to save money.  I swear to God.  See, this show that you listen to is very different than most radio shows.  So you're saving money.  After all that crap. 
[00:47:30]  Uh-huh.  And listening to you.  Uh-huh.  And getting influenced by you and calling for a revolution.  Now.  Barry told me I am actually saving money because of Obamacare.  I want to know, though.  Not a lot.  I'm saving a little over 1%.  1%.  That's kind of a lot.  And some of the numbers, you know, are dropped.  Like.  But.  Premiums and such.  What about.  What about deductibles? 
[00:48:00]  See, the premiums go down.  Oh, the deductibles went down, too.  The deductibles went down.  What about your co-pays?  I thought you had lost your plan.  I did.  Oh, no.  But then it got replaced with a better one.  It's what's called a blessing in disguise.  Oh.  A blessing in disguise.  See.  Oh, my God.  And this is why this show is different.  I could have kept that info to myself.  Sure.  And kept the whole revolution thing going.  But. 
[00:48:30]  I guess I got to throw myself under the bus.  I'm actually saving just a tad bit.  But.  Yeah.  You know, obviously, Barry is both our guys.  Yeah.  And, you know, he doesn't discuss your finances.  I'm sure he doesn't discuss my finances with you.  But he did say this.  He said, I can't discuss Anthony's finances, but I will tell you this.  He's getting fucked.  Yes. 
[00:49:00]  You're getting fucked because I guess you don't have a wife and a few kids.  Yeah.  When you have a wife and kids, obviously, they give you a little more of a break.  He's actually saying you're getting fucked a lot.  Oh, I'm getting fucked.  Tool.  And I begged him for the numbers.  But, you know.  Yeah, I'm getting tool.  Safe to say that he's not going to, like, break down numbers.  Yeah, yeah.  Even with me begging.  Yeah, yeah.  No, I know I'm getting tool.  Because I kind of wanted to have a good laugh at your expense.  But he did go as far as to say you're getting fucked a lot.  Yep. 
[00:49:30]  But me, I'm actually saving some money.  Wow.  Damn.  Not a lot.  I mean, I can barely buy a nice dinner from it.  But technically, it's like a lateral move.  A little over 1% I'm saving.  Yeah.  You think Drudge will pick this up?  Oh, God.  I don't think so.  Oh, some of those bloggers will, though.  After all that.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  That misinformed shock shock.  Because I'm the one that they determine has more money, you know, than I know what to do with. 
[00:50:00]  So I can pay for the poor people that need their insurance.  Opie has a wife and a couple of kids.  So they're like, well, he's got his own family to deal with.  So you're penalized for deciding you don't want to, you know, have a wife and kids in this country, I guess.  Can I be honest now that the jokes are out of the way, though?  Oh.  We're lucky enough to have a guy.  We're lucky enough to have a guy.  Right.  And most of my life and your life, we didn't have guys. 
[00:50:30]  No.  So we had to do our own taxes.  When you do your own taxes, let's start there, you get fucked.  Of course.  Because no one understands the tax codes and everything that goes into it.  All those little loopholes.  All those little tiny things that you could, you know, deduct and all that.  And in the end, you could actually make some money.  I highly recommend everyone goes to a tax guy.  Even if it's that local, whatever the hell.  What are some of those?  Yeah.  Because they will find stuff that you're not going to find.  And, you know, it'll pay. 
[00:51:00]  You will pay this guy's fee in the end.  Yeah.  Yeah.  With the money you're saving.  You're not going to lose money by doing that.  So in the days when we used to have to do our own taxes, we got fucked.  Totally.  So we finally got a guy, and it's all on the up and up and legal.  And, wow.  Wow.  When you have a guy that's knowledgeable with taxes, you actually do save a bunch of money.  The government doesn't want you to be educated on how to pay your taxes.  Hell no.  Because they want people to overpay.  Yeah.  And then, and the second part of this, we have Barry. 
[00:51:30]  If I had to get my own health insurance because of Obamacare, I guarantee you that I would have been paying more.  Yeah.  But because he's knowledgeable in that world, I'm saving money.  He knows where to look.  He knows where to look around.  Right.  Which one to get.  Exactly.  What do you need.  Like, all right, I'm going to do this, but I'm going to add this and this.  I wouldn't know how to do all that.  No.  And I got pretty much the same coverage, and I'm saving a little over 1%.  Damn. 
[00:52:00]  So, yeah.  Look at that.  So we're lucky in that way.  Yeah.  You know?  No Obamacare horror story from Opie.  No.  Well, this guy's got, no, I don't like Obama.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  I do like all the photoshops of, there's a picture of me and Sean Hannity out there.  Uh-huh.  I will encourage people because it has already started.  Yeah.  But they're turning me into a hippie.  I saw that.  Did you see the hippie one?  Yeah, they photoshopped like a hippie, and then they photoshopped you with an Obama shirt  on and buttons. 
[00:52:30]  So I encourage you to continue with that.  It's fine.  It's pretty funny.  Actually, if you send me that picture, Iraq, I'll put it on my Instagram.  That was a good one.  I think it's on the O and A show Instagram right now.  But anyway, I encourage you to photoshop that.  It's fine.  I mean, I think we're even, by the way.  Yeah.  Sean Hannity called me a crybaby liberal, and I called him a dickhead.  I think that's pretty good.  I think that's pretty good.  Sounds like a clean slate to me.  I think so.  Snowy!  Hey, guys.  How you doing? 
[00:53:00]  It's been a couple weeks, Snowy.  You all right?  Yeah, I'm good.  How about you guys?  What are you hauling today?  You're doing pretty good.  What are you hauling today?  Huh?  Aren't you a...  You're hauling?  Yeah.  Hauling ass.  Hauling ass.  All right, whatever.  Got it.  What do you got?  It's obvious why Anthony's getting jobs.  He doesn't like Obama.  You're getting better because you like Obama.  Remember?  You're a big liberal.  Ah, see?  That could be it.  I like this.  So...  I like this a lot.  Obama's trying to divide and conquer thing right here. 
[00:53:30]  That's what it is.  Hey, we'll save Opie some money.  We'll fuck Anthony over and...  Oh, boy.  This is an embarrassing morning.  Oh, man.  It really is embarrassing.  I should have kept this one to myself, but...  I think that's the beauty of our show, though.  We have no problem going on our fucking...  Whoopsie.  I've got to kind of tell everyone what happened.  Now you've got to go on Hannity's show and say,  Actually, Sean, I'm saving some money with Obamacare.  It's working out nicely.  I'm saving money.  Yeah.  Jeez.  He had a whole list of things, and then it got to that. 
[00:54:00]  And I'm biting my lips.  I'm like, Here it comes.  Here it comes.  You know?  Big dick.  And then he crunched the numbers, and I just started laughing.  And I'm like, Oh, wait.  Wait until Anthony hears this one.  I know.  Wait until he hears this one.  That's it.  I said, I'll pay.  For all the poor people.  I'm in.  I got it.  Don't worry.  But he did say, you know, he's got daughters in their 20s-ish.  Probably just out of college.  I'm trying to think.  We've been with Barry for so long.  And he said he had to go on the Obama site. 
[00:54:30]  And like I said, he is extremely knowledgeable with this stuff.  Yeah.  And he said his brain blew up.  He said it's completely ridiculous that this was rolled out as early as it was.  Yeah.  And he actually agrees that, you know, we should have some kind of health insurance for everybody.  He is one of those guys.  Well, he is a liberal.  You think he is?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I've talked to him for a long time.  He's not an Obama guy.  No, he's not an Obama guy, but he's a liberal.  Even liberals that have any knowledge of economics and money don't like Obama. 
[00:55:00]  But Bush was good for us, and he used to talk about that.  He didn't like Bush, though, as a president.  No, but he liked it as far as, you know, the stocks went.  Of course.  He liked it as far as our plans.  Yes.  He's moving our stuff around.  Did you hear that one?  Yeah, yeah.  Yesterday the market took a pretty big hit.  Did it?  Yeah, yeah.  How many points?  It was 265, I think, something like that, on the Dow.  The Nasdaq lost 3%.  Yeah, some tech fucking shit happened. 
[00:55:30]  But, yeah, it's a good market.  What are you going to do?  I got a ticklish fucking nostril today.  Ooh.  Whoa.  Good thing you got Obamacare.  You'll be fine.  Yeah, just fucking go to the doctor.  What is it, a buck?  On the Obamacare?  What is that?  I just threw out the first sneeze for allergy season.  Oh.  There it is.  The first one, every year I get this.  Is it the first, like, nice day?  Yeah.  It hits you?  You get that ticklish nostril.  It's ridiculous. 
[00:56:00]  And boy, was that nice yesterday.  It was beautiful, huh?  Oh, finally.  It felt weird to be out.  It was.  It was because it was nice and fucking...  It's, you could smell things.  Right.  You could smell nature outside.  You could smell that dirt.  The dirt.  And that dirt is about to do some things.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  It doesn't just smell like dirt.  You know, like, it's going to do things.  It's going to crack open and start growing shit.  Grow some green and colorful shit out of it.  I'm going to need tissues all day. 
[00:56:30]  Can you hand me that?  Ah, yes.  That literally was the first sneeze of the algae season.  God.  It was such a nice day yesterday, as a matter of fact.  I decided to put the little harness and leash on little Beavis and take him for a walk out back.  You're not one of those guys.  You don't have a leash for your cat, do you?  I had phone this on my Instagram.  I was off Twitter yesterday.  I was taking a little break.  It was so nice out.  I've got to see this picture.  That I decided to take a little Beavis out for a walk. 
[00:57:00]  Cats should never be on a leash.  He loves it.  You're scared he's going to run away and jump over the fences?  Yeah, that's why.  You know, if I could just let him out back and knew he was going to stay in the yard, I would do that.  But I have to put a little harness and leash on him.  Oh, man.  And then I just let him walk around wherever he wants to go.  But how are you going to handle this?  Because now you're going to move the whole party outdoors.  How are you going to handle this?  You're going to want him outside with you. 
[00:57:30]  Toward the end of last year, last season, I had him.  Right.  And, you know, he just has to stay inside.  Or, you know.  Can't you, like, introduce him to the outside?  Man, you should have put him outside right from the beginning here and there.  You know what?  That always happens.  They wind up jumping over the fucking fence, getting out somehow.  And then they wander around.  They come back with fleas cut up or smushed like Smokey back in Central Iceland.  Half of them was flat and full of maggots.  Or chipmunks.  Or chipmunks.  They love bringing chipmunks to your front stoop. 
[00:58:00]  Yeah, yeah.  I don't need a fucking trained killer coming back to the house every night.  I walk him around a little bit.  He loves it.  Yeah.  And then back in the house, motherfucker.  My cat Velcro.  Velcro.  Because he used to climb the walls in Buffalo.  Oh.  And they were all carpeted.  Yeah.  They had, we were so poor up there in Buffalo doing radio.  Instead of soundproofing, they had actual carpet on the walls.  Carpet on the walls.  And this cat that was a stray cat that we just decided to adopt. 
[00:58:30]  Straw hat?  Straw hat.  Very good.  That's what Danny says.  And, you know, everyone handled the cat very nicely.  And we all, it was our responsibility just to feed him.  But he was a radio station cat.  The morning guy wasn't a cat guy, to be honest with you.  I'll just say that much.  So I decided to maybe, I don't know, save the cat's life.  Oh.  So I took him in.  And his name was Velcro.  So when I moved back to Long Island to do BAB, my shift ended around 2 in the morning. 
[00:59:00]  And I would come home.  And he'd run from the top of the woods at my parents' house.  Because I was with them at first.  Oh.  And he would drop off a chipmunk at the front door.  Oh, bring you a little present, huh?  But you're coming home.  And like, by the time I got home, it was like 2.30, 3 in the morning.  And there, he would see the car.  This cat was smart like Beavis.  Because I know you've talked about how smart Beavis is.  And he would hear the car knowing I'm home.  And he would come running from way out in the woods and drop a chipmunk every night. 
[00:59:30]  And it was horrific.  Bring it to the pack leader.  It was horrific.  Yeah, yeah.  He would drop it and then run inside.  That's fucked up.  Do they eat those things?  I think they just like killing them.  Really?  Yeah, and then presenting it to whoever they see as like the fucking supreme being.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But anyway, sorry.  So Beavis was outside and you took him for a walk.  So little Beavis was outside.  I took him for a little walk outside.  And, you know, I gotta say, the listeners are really very cool about it. 
[01:00:00]  Because no one made fun of me for it.  Hey, faggot.  Does the harness match your purse?  Crazy cat lady.  Oh, no way.  Yeah.  You know, all the girls love it.  Of course.  The girls are all like, aw, how cute.  That's adorable.  What a great cat.  And that's all that matters.  Exactly.  Because that's who you want to fuck.  Right.  I'm not looking to fuck no guys. 
[01:00:30]  As long as the girls have nice things to say about it.  I'm not trying to impress you, sir.  Beavis is a chick magnet.  That's right.  Why don't you shoot video?  I don't know.  I just took a few pictures.  It looks like Beavis hates the leash.  I'll take him out.  No, if he hated the leash, he'd do that cat thing where he gets down and tries to squeeze  out of it.  Right.  But he liked it.  He just was walking around.  He walked around all around the yard and on the pool cover.  That's cool.  And then he was rolling around on the hot slate because the sun was hitting the slate 
[01:01:00]  and it was nice and warm.  So he was rolling around on that shit.  Yeah, he's great.  So I just don't see it working out where he's inside that whole summer out there.  Well, I'll take him out.  Is there anything you could do with the fences?  I don't know.  Nah, cats will always find a fucking way out.  They're like mice.  They'll find some fucking way to jump the fence, get out.  And he's just one of those, you know, I could see him just tearing off after some fucking  thing.  That's it.  He'd be gone.  Right.  First of all, someone might steal him.  They'll just look at him and go, oh, that's a leopard. 
[01:01:30]  Let me take him home.  Or, you know, they get squished by cars all the time.  True.  Dead cats, side of the road, happens all the time.  Poor Smokey.  Oh, you want to know what happened to Velcro?  What happened to Velcro?  Well, my parents used to live on 25A.  Oh, boy.  And I came home one day after, I forgot what I was doing, but just having a wonderful Saturday  somewhere, maybe at the beach or a park or something.  I don't know.  And I come home to my dad being extremely sad. 
[01:02:00]  Oh, hey, what's up, everyone?  Oh, hey, what's going on?  And he told me that he buried Velcro onto the apple tree.  He got smushed on the...  Like Jenny.  He got smushed on 25A.  On 25A.  And then he had to tell me the details that he let Velcro die in his arms.  You don't want to hear that.  Like, what the fuck?  My dad.  Oh, man.  When you listen to this radio show and you hear just an inkling of niceness in my voice 
[01:02:30]  at times, just imagine that at times a thousand.  Yeah.  My dad was the nicest, coolest guy.  Never yelled.  Never had a problem with anyone.  Just pure love in his heart.  Yeah.  So he held Velcro.  He actually told me he held Velcro until he turned cold.  Whoa.  And then buried him.  Poor little feller.  And then I jumped in my car like a little faggot and had to get out of there.  Oh, you did? 
[01:03:00]  To just be sad.  Oh.  Because he was my little pal.  Oh, man.  He was my little pal for a while.  That happens with every fucking animal that's allowed to just run wild outside.  It will always come in contact with a tire.  Dude, my house.  So we lost Velcro and we lost three other dogs.  Jesus.  25A is not the place to live if you want animals.  Like that house from fucking Pet Sematary.  Well, the famous story where my brother's Rottweiler got hit. 
[01:03:30]  Yeah.  But we think, you know, he was getting a little older and decided, oh, I see what I could do.  I could just cash it in here.  And that day was one of the roughest days of my life.  I have no problem telling the story quickly again.  My dad just buried his own brother who died way too early.  Yeah.  And we were all extremely sad, obviously.  We went our own ways after the wake and the funeral. 
[01:04:00]  And all of a sudden I get a call from my dad.  He goes, you've got to get over here immediately.  I'm like, oh, God, he's still really upset about his brother.  He's having a moment.  It turns out my brother's there, the owner of FH Riley's, just, you can't console him.  Oh, no.  His dog got hit.  And that was his pal because they lived in Florida together.  He had his Rottweiler since it was just a little, as big as your fist, basically.  Oh, boy.  That's not good.  And the story goes, my dad was at the end of his life, more or less. 
[01:04:30]  He had, like, only one artery really working.  And this dog got hit on 25A.  My dad lifted this thing up.  It had to be at least 80 pounds to get it out of the road, risking his own life.  Something like that would have dropped my dad easily.  And he put him in a wheelbarrow with a blanket.  And I went over there.  And my brother, like, he couldn't even stand up.  He was so, I've never seen anyone this upset in my life.  Yee.  And all of a sudden, he dramatic, not, I shouldn't say dramatically. 
[01:05:00]  All of a sudden, he looks at me after he kind of gets it together.  And he goes, I've got to bury him now.  And it was winter.  And we'd go in the backyard.  I had to wheel the dog into the backyard in the wheelbarrow.  Oh, no.  And he couldn't even look at the dog.  But he goes, I have to bury him now.  And it was that middle of the winter frozen ground.  What a morbid scene this is.  And it was, I swear to you, it was maybe 12 degrees out. 
[01:05:30]  And it was a full moon.  I remember this like it was yesterday.  I'm thinking, this is the opening scene of a horror flick.  Yeah.  And there he is, just digging through this frozen ground.  And I'm just sitting there with him.  And then all of a sudden, we had to lower his dog into the hole.  And then, like, and I made the mistake.  I had the flashlight the whole time.  And the flashlight hit his dog.  And then he broke down again.  And fell to his knees.  Holy jeez.  And the short version of the story, we buried his dog that night. 
[01:06:00]  But we lived on this really busy road that was taking out our pets over and over again.  And then, the irony, it takes out my dad.  That's where he died.  Yeah.  That road was fucking terrible.  After all those years where he was running out, getting all the pets and stuff that were getting smushed.  And other car accidents, by the way, because we used to live around a curve.  I think I told the story where there was a guardrail.  And one night when I was about 13 or 14, a car, a drunk driver, hit the guardrail. 
[01:06:30]  Because they put a guardrail up because these cars used to go flying off the road in the woods.  And that was it.  And so they said, oh, we've got to put a guardrail.  So the guardrail made these people bounce off that right toward our house.  Oh, great.  And one hit our house going about 70 miles an hour to the point we couldn't open our front door.  Destroyed the whole side of the house as we're all sleeping.  And my dad ran out for that.  My dad also ran out one time when, in the middle of the night, all we heard was, help me, help me, help me. 
[01:07:00]  And it turns out a car flipped over outside our house again because of this guardrail.  This fucking road is the worst.  Dude, it was brutal.  And what turned out, he hit a pole, but it didn't wake anyone up for whatever reason.  And all he heard in the middle of the night was, help me, help me.  So he goes outside, and there's a live wire across this guy's car.  He dragged that guy out, kind of helped him, or maybe saved his life.  I don't know.  And then you fast forward, and he's going to lunch with a couple friends. 
[01:07:30]  He's not driving.  And they take the left out of my driveway, which no one did.  That's how bad this road was.  That's a tough turn.  And that's when he got T-boned, and the rest is history.  So in the end, he lost his life in front of the house as well.  That's like fucking Vietnam.  Almost a house of horrors, I've got to say.  House of horrors.  You know what?  That's your house of horrors.  House of horrors.  Yeah.  But what does this have to do with Beavis outside?  I don't know.  Oh, because you don't want your dog out there. 
[01:08:00]  Oh, because you don't want your cat outside.  Right.  I don't want him getting flattened, so I keep tabs on him.  Yeah.  Put the little harness on.  He was very cool about it.  Is anything growing in the backyard yet?  A few little things.  He was sniffing around everything.  Do you see the hint of green in the trees?  A little bit.  A little bit.  If you squint your eyes, you're like, okay, you can see it.  It's about to happen.  I'm just waiting for the two jizz trees in my front yard to bloom, as Bobby Kelly calls  them, the jizz trees. 
[01:08:30]  Those are those white, pom-pom-y flowers on these trees.  They're very round, like soft balls of flowers that grow.  And Bob Kelly is adamant about the fact that they smell like jizz.  Right.  Yeah.  The jizz trees.  We might have to bring some of the jizz trees in here.  And he talks about it and goes, bleh!  Right.  Yeah, we set him up bad that one year.  Yeah.  We hit some of the jizz trees in his microphone.  Yeah, yeah.  And they start puking.  What's on the mic, dude? 
[01:09:00]  It's a bleh!  Bleh!  Bleh!  Maybe I'll repost that.  I think I got it on my channel somewhere.  Yeah.  But anyway.  There you have it.  Yeah.  We got food.  We should eat.  Yeah, let's chow down, as they say.  Ha-ha, right?  Uh-oh.  Here's...  Look what I do.  Uh-oh.  This next page shows us what guests are on.  Uh-oh.  Peel it off slow.  Who is it?  Ah, all right.  Cool.  Dan Soder is in today.  Oh, that's good.  Yep. 
[01:09:30]  I like doing radio with Dan.  Dan is a really funny comic, and he did radio.  Yes.  It's perfect.  I love the guy.  Anyone else today?  Or...  Check it out.  Down.  Shouldn't we know who's in yet?  We should.  I was going to say, there's a lot of radio shows who find out this information before.  Before the show even begins.  Sam, being a... used to be a young guy in the business...  Are you amazed how we do this show?  It's perplexing. 
[01:10:00]  It is, right?  It doesn't make sense.  It doesn't.  And by the way, nobody else could pull it off.  I don't know how that works, right?  But we didn't get lazier.  We've always done it this way.  This has been since day one.  Day one.  This is how we do the show.  The fact that you've been as successful as anybody has in this medium...  It's vexing.  It's very vexed.  It's perplexing and frustrating.  Ah.  Why is it frustrating?  Because, I mean, there's so many people...  It's the story of...  There's so many people who try everything, right? 
[01:10:30]  Oh, yeah.  And they're just going...  Yeah, I'm going to meet this person.  I'm going to try this.  I'm going to prep for that.  I'm going to do...  Hours of preparation.  And it's like, you guys just rolled into a studio and just did a good show.  Right.  And then became the biggest thing in radio.  It really fucked up.  The biggest?  Oh.  For a period of time, I would say so.  What?  Now it's Sam Roberts' time.  Well...  You think?  It's time to shine.  Well...  Yeah.  Oh, shit. 
[01:11:00]  Sam does a very good job.  He's the king of the interview.  Oh, yeah.  God.  Do you say no to anyone?  No.  He loves a good interview.  No, I don't.  I kind of told you that years ago.  I said, take everyone.  I take everyone.  He does.  And you do.  Sometimes I see, oh, the Sam Roberts show.  Here's who's on.  And I look at the pictures and go, I don't even know who that is.  Last night was Christopher Maloney and Tony Danza.  Tony Danza?  Yeah.  And Christopher Maloney from Oz and SVU.  Right.  I remember him.  I wouldn't interview most of those people. 
[01:11:30]  No.  You do a good job with it.  I just...  Thank you.  That's your world.  I just...  I just...  I don't care enough.  But we had good interviews this week.  Yeah.  We certainly did.  Trejo was amazing.  We've got to put that on the podcast.  Trejo was great.  Fucking...  Iron Sheik was good because it was a different version of him this week.  Iron Sheik.  And, yeah, Saget was great, too.  Oh, Bob was good, too, because he was...  Bob was good.  He was very reflective because he just lost his mom.  So we got a different Bob Saget this week. 
[01:12:00]  Yes, a different Bob Saget.  But as much as you complain about them before you do them, most of your interviews are good.  Yes.  Yes.  I know, but...  But we do complain because it is a chore.  But you've got to work too hard to make it happen.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We just fucked around, and look how easy this first 45 minutes was.  Right, right.  If we had a guest in here, we'd have to fucking talk to them.  Cater to their needs.  That's what an interview is, I guess.  I don't like catering to their needs.  I hate that part. 
[01:12:30]  I don't know why.  Oh, cater to their needs.  The needy guests.  I far prefer interview people than watch you interview people.  Wow, look at that.  Yeah.  What's this whiteness thing?  Well, that's the greatest thing on the face of the earth.  This woman on MSNBC, she wrote a book about discovering her whiteness, not in terms of  white supremacy, but in terms of verging on white privilege, like discovering what it 
[01:13:00]  means to be white.  She's so guilt-ridden.  Yeah.  So guilt-ridden about being a white person.  I get embarrassed by these people.  So we've got some clips.  It's embarrassing.  We've got Hillary Clinton getting a shoe thrown at her, and a man in Rio de Janeiro tries  to steal a woman's necklace while she gives a TV interview.  Oh, okay.  I want to see that clip.  About violence and stuff.  Oh, really?  And stuff, yeah.  I haven't seen that clip yet.  A story about that.  And did we pull the Nancy Grace?  Yeah, I have it. 
[01:13:30]  The video.  I know people get sick of us talking about wrestling.  We only bring it up, the big stories.  Sam, we're not recapping what happens in the matches.  Sam goes deep with that shit.  I can't be bothered.  But, like, big, huge headlines, like a WrestleMania thing, or Hulk coming in, or Iron Sheik.  We do the stories that cross over into mainstream media, not just wrestling.  But she went after the wrestling world because of the Ultimate Warrior's death. 
[01:14:00]  Yep.  And she's thinking drugs with him, huh?  Yeah, she made the immediate jump to steroids, which was the cause of death.  What was her hashtag?  I don't know what her hashtag was, but all the wrestling fans turned around and created  their own hashtag.  Oh, I bet they did.  Cancel Nancy Grace.  Oh.  See, but we don't want her to cancel.  Cobert.  I hate her, too.  Right.  But we have to stand strong here.  Yeah.  I don't want anyone fired for their shit.  No, no one fired.  Their shit.  But I don't like her. 
[01:14:30]  I hear he's not going to be on the Daily Show anymore.  Yeah.  Cobert reporting.  It's gone.  Yeah, that really worked out.  That worked out.  Right.  Congratulations to the Asians.  He just gets the biggest gig that's offered.  Asians.  Boy, not much pull.  Oops.  So we got lots to do, but we're going to eat first.  So stay there.

Honestly, we canceled an appointment to have Jake euthanized to give Dynavite a chance  to save this dog's life.  Jake is an 8-year-old male Akita.  His entire stomach and groin area, his face, his elbows, his ears, every orifice was just  riddled with yeast and sores.  We had a vet treat him and Jake didn't respond at all. 
[01:21:30]  My son heard a commercial for Dynavite, D-I-N-O-V-I-T-E-O.com.  859-428-1000.  The omega-3 fatty acids.  Flaxseed, zinc, alfalfa.  The digestive enzymes that are cooked out of regular dog food.  Within four days, Jake started to heal.  It was the most amazing thing I have ever seen.  The yeast is receding and now his belly is completely cleared up.  It chokes me up.  It brings tears to my eyes.  Everything we tried failed except the Dynavite.

This weekend?  Is it SideSplitters?  Yeah  Is that the name?  Hmm  I believe so, yes  Rings a bell 
[01:24:30]  I heard the, uh  Some people were sending me links to the  Story about the dollar store  Right  Being, uh  Laying off a bunch of employees  And cutting their already low prices  On the garbage they sell  Yeah  Because they're, uh  Just bleeding money  And that's like the only place  Lady Di applied for a job  But  I don't think they'll be calling  No  What we learned when she was here for a week  She gave us great radio and all  And a lot of people felt sorry for her 
[01:25:00]  Including us  To a certain extent  To a point  I just find it so annoying now  Yeah, then you get really frustrated by her  But we, we finally realized  She's in no shape to ever have a job  No, she couldn't work  She couldn't hold a job  No way  Could you imagine  Oh, there's the family dollar  Oh, there it is  Family dollar closing stores  370 of them  370 stores closing  And all the people getting thrown out  Wow  You think they're gonna be like  Yeah, but  This woman  She might be able to help us  Yeah  You gotta hire her  But when you call  Your, your store 
[01:25:30]  The dollar store  Yeah  You can't raise your prices  Right  That's what businesses do  To try to kind of make it up a little bit  Right  Well, they could just change the  They're stuck  They could  The two dollar store  I bet you there's a few things  Over a dollar in there  I bet  But they probably justify it by saying  Yeah, but most of our stuff  Is a dollar  Or less  When I was a kid  You'd go into the old  Five and ten store  Oh my God  How old are you?  The five and ten  And then  I know you're older than me  But not by much  But some of these references  I know  But you know 
[01:26:00]  It was the tail end of  Of those things  When I was a kid  It was like  That was a whole era  That was being  Eliminated from the face of the earth  What did you used to get  In the five and ten store?  I really don't know  Knock off matchbox cars  Things like that  Oh, okay  Little fucking  Doodads  Yeah  But uh  I always used to think like  Hey, this is a quarter  Why is this in a five and ten?  Really?  Technical Anthony  Yeah  I know  What a little dick bag  Did you 
[01:26:30]  Did you go tattle?  No, I didn't tattle  I probably cried  That I couldn't afford it  Nice  So the rock and roll  Rock and roll  Hall of fame thing  Happened last night  Over there  I heard a little bit of that  Driving in  Kiss  I heard  Yeah, Kiss  Here are the details  Kiss obviously didn't perform  No  Because they're at war  And then Gene Simmons  New book  I guess he's calling  Anti-Semitic  What?  Was it Paul Stanley's book? 
[01:27:00]  Yeah, it's Paul's book  Paul's book  Why did I just read  Like it was Gene Simmons  Saying that then?  Who said  Who is Paul's  Calling anti-Semitic?  Ace and Peter  Oh yeah?  Mm-hmm  Well maybe when you have  Um  When you have a guy  That leads the band  And he is Jewish  And he completely  Fucks you over  Maybe that  Leads you to  Be anti-Semitic  It leads to maybe  Some stereotypes  Maybe  Maybe  Maybe Gene Simmons  Was not treating these guys 
[01:27:30]  Like they felt  They should have been  Treated financially  And they probably  Blurted out some things  That are usually  Very stereotypical  Politically incorrect  Stanley even accused  The latter two  Of anti-Semitism  Okay, yeah  In his book  Sorry  I read that wrong  Um  Hmm  So they didn't perform  And then you had  Nirvana  Yeah  You don't got the Kurt  And then Travis  Gave me the  The rundown  On that whole thing  It sounded like 
[01:28:00]  It was great  Yeah  Where is Travis?  Travis  Right here  So basically  The band performed  With a bunch of  Female singers  Yes  Did Pat Smear  Play with them?  Yes he did  Oh he did  Yes  Okay  And then he played  At their secret  Brooklyn show  Right after  They had a secret  Brooklyn show  Wow  At two in the morning  But it wasn't a secret  Because the word  Got out  Because if no word  Ever got out  There'd be  No I understand  The staff would be  Standing there  With fucking Nirvana  Playing  I remember  I think it was  The Black Crow show  That I talk about  Every once in a while 
[01:28:30]  Where I was about  20 feet from the stage  And peeing in beer bottles  Because I didn't want  To lose my spot  But everyone else  Was doing it  Where'd you get  The empties man?  Oh by the way  I didn't expect  The demand  Just give me a little time  We're printing out  We're printing up  The shirts now  People are mad  They haven't gotten  Their shirts out  And we might have  More on sale  I don't know  We'll figure it out  I thought it was a goof  Apparently not  I would sell maybe  A hundred  Oh boy  Sold well over 
[01:29:00]  Ten times that  Jesus  Pretty amazing  But anyway  I remember  The Black Crow show  Was one of these  Secret shows  And I'm like  Ooh I'm in on  The secret  Yeah  And I show up  There's a line  A mile long  The word always gets out  It's never a secret  It's some weird ploy  I guess  Blue Ways to Cult  Would show up  At fucking  Cheers  Or Hammerhead  At Father's Place  My Father's Place  As a soft white  Underbelly  And you'd be like  Oh  It's Blue Ways to Cult 
[01:29:30]  No one else knows  Let's go  And then you'd go  And it's like  You realize  When you're eight blocks away  And you can't find parking  But you always thought  You were in on  Some little thing  Did you hear?  Or maybe a few  Yeah  Everyone knew  Everyone knew  That soft white  Underbelly  Was their  Yeah  Their other name  When they wanted  To do smaller gigs  Yeah  Now they just go out  As Blue Oyster  Because they're just  Hoping to get anybody  Come on  They had to drop  That soft white 
[01:30:00]  Underbelly shit  Fuck that  So who performed  With Dave Grohl  And Nova Selleck  And Smears  Joan Jett  Came out first  And she did  Smells Like Teen Spirit  That's a little weird  Which I hear was very good  Was it?  Yes  I heard all the performances  That Nirvana did  Were really good  Joan Jett, huh?  Yeah  She's friends with Dave Grohl  Oh, that's it  Okay  Does she still  Does she still love rock and roll?  I don't know  Hmm  And it's gonna cost  A little more than a dime  In that jukebox  I'll tell you that  Oh boy 
[01:30:30]  Talk about me  Talking about five and dime  Put another dime  In the jukebox, baby  Are you kidding me?  What?  Inflation  First of all  Who uses a jukebox anymore?  I used to  I used to kind of like  Doing that  Stand by the jukebox  No, at a diner  Oh, at the diner  Remember those diners  With those tiny ones?  Jukeboxes by the table  Yeah  I used to like to see  What songs they had in there  There was always some journey  In there  It was separate ways  Dennis Falcone  Just got hard down the hall  Oh, yeah  Oh, they're talking about  Jukeboxes  Hey  And B-sides 
[01:31:00]  I used to hate  Leaving a bar  Before my songs  That I paid for  Come on  Sucked  Yeah  And then you always  Got mad at people  That would pick  The stupid songs  It's like, who played  This shitty song?  Remember  Look around the bar  And go  I bet it was her  Well, you would see  The one person  Getting all excited  Woo, my song  And it always just  Killed the vibe  In the bar  Like, what are you doing?  Everyone else is on  The same page  Picking the songs  With, you know  A nice up-tempo  Or whatever  A classic country 
[01:31:30]  A party feel  Or whatever  They find the classic  Country song  At the fucking  Back of the jukebox  Yeah  Joe on Long Island  Was at the show  I was at  Wow, a lot of people  Were at the show  Where was it?  Barclays  At the Barclays  In Brooklyn  Dan, Floral Park  The man?  Dan, the man  Hey, guys  Hey, buddy  I was told  We've got to turn up  The phones  Hold on  How's that?  Sounds better?  Go ahead, Dan  Hey, how are you?  Hey  Oh, that's it 
[01:32:00]  Yes, I was there  Last night  It was a great time  It ended at like  1 o'clock or 12.30  Or something  So I've got maybe  4 or 5 hours of sleep  And I'm going to work  Like a complete zombie  Good for you  So did you like  I'm a teacher  So the kids today  Will not know anything  Oh  Thank you  Joe on Long Island  I'll try Joe  Joe  I was at the show  Last night too  There was a rumor  All night  That kids were going to play  The grand finale  But Bruce Springfield 
[01:32:30]  And his band  Wasted about an hour  And a half a time  So at 12.30 or so  They abruptly  Just kind of  Ended the show  Take a night  And turned the lights on  Yeah, Bruce Springsteen  Was there because  They inducted  The E Street band  Which is strange  Ridiculous  When you just induct  Bruce Springsteen  Bruce Springsteen  He was inducted  A long time ago  Every E Street band  Talked him like he was God  Yeah, but I understand that  But maybe they should have  Inducted the band  On the same day  But maybe separated  To give Bruce his time  Yeah  It's really strange  Years later  They inducted  The E Street band  They were good 
[01:33:00]  But they wasted  An hour and a half  Of time  Which I'm sure  Other people  Could have played  What, just playing  Long fucking songs  No, they were  They were all told  To spend 30 seconds  On their acceptance speech  Yeah  Because there's 11 members  That were inducted  Oh my God  And they all spent  Like at least  Five to six minutes  Oh my God  Really?  So people had to  Listen to these  Fucking people  Just droning on  These nobodies  Behind Bruce Springsteen  Oh  Oh, Roland's gonna get mad  So it was about  An hour 
[01:33:30]  It was just babble  Wait, so you  Had to listen to  These guys talk  For the total time  Was an hour?  Yeah  They were just babble  It was the most  Boring, you know  Time  That had to be  So boring  Wow  So boring  And everybody  Saw the KISS members  Leave their table  A good, you know  Half an hour  Before the show ended  Because the rumor was  They were gonna play  The finale  Right  For sure they were  Who started that rumor  Yeah  Well, that sucks  Wow, man  That is so boring  Was Lil' Steven there? 
[01:34:00]  Lil' Steven was there  He played  Did he give a speech?  He gave a speech  As Syl?  They all think  I hear it as Syl  Thank you  I like Lil' Steven  He's always been  Very nice to us  But, man  Eleven fucking  E Street band members  That's crazy  Getting up there  And droning  On and on  And on  And did they play then?  They played  With Bruce?  They played  With Bruce  It was Bruce's show  Wow, okay  How was Nirvana's performance? 
[01:34:30]  Nirvana was great  Joan Jett was great  Lord played  Forgot the name of the girls  But two girls  From rock  Punk bands  They were all good  St. Vincent and Kim Gordon  How shitty did Lord look?  She's a little interesting looking  Poor Lord  She's got a seizure on stage  But she sings good  Yeah, she does a little seizure  Moves and she puts her hair  In front of her face  But she looks so beautiful  In her hit song  I don't know how they did that  They gussied her up  Because she doesn't look like that  In real life 
[01:35:00]  She looks like she crawled out  Of the ring well  Right  Photoshop works wonders  I said she looks like the ugly  Kardashian sister  They have a very similar look  Oh yeah?  Yeah, the one that's not modeling  She tweeted something  That there was a picture of her  And I guess they had  Photoshopped her skin  All the blemishes out  And everything like that  And she reposted the actual photo  And said, hey  You know, this is how I look  And people shouldn't  You know  Right  She explained so much  About how they look  And did that  So I guess she's trying 
[01:35:30]  To own it  Yeah  She has the weirdest  Fucking body too  It's strange  She  Her  She got like a belly on her  Right  And then it goes up  To like nothingness  Right  She's shaped kind of like a pear  But it's a small pear  She's shaped like a pepper  But the one picture looks like  Her ass was twisted  Into the front of her body  Yes, yes  The one Sal showed us  The other day  Yeah, like the top of her thighs  Like where her lap would be  Right  Were puffing out 
[01:36:00]  Like butt cheeks  She's too young to have  That many problems  With her body  I know  I don't know what's going on  With this girl  Man  Because it's not like  She's fat or anything  It's just  No  It's just put together weird  Really strangely  Yeah  All right  There, Joe  Thank you  Thank you  All right  Just keep criticizing  A 17 or 18 year old girl's  Fucking body  So many other girls  Can just start cutting  And  Dating me  People 
[01:36:30]  You think  Young girls have body issues  Oh, price almighty  Do they ever  And do we contribute to that  Yes, we do  You think  We're so critical  Why can't we just look at Lorde  And think like  Oh, look at her  She fucking has a great voice  I love that song  She's just an awkward girl  Yeah  Does she have another hit  Off that album  Or is it going to be kind of  That's the only one  I mean, she released another single  But it's not as 
[01:37:00]  It didn't do well, huh?  Not like  That Royals  Is just an amazing song  I would love to hear her  Doing Nirvana  What do we got, Travis?  Do we have it?  I know  I know there are YouTube clips  And the quality is in that  Great, but  There's actually  A pretty good clip  I can send it to Sam  Okay  She did a good job  It's just tough to watch her  She did all apologies?  Yes  Nice  She did all apologies  Joan Jett did  Smells Like Teen Spirit  Of course she did  Kim Gordon from Sonic Youth  Did Aneurysm  Wow  Nice  And 
[01:37:30]  Annie Clark  Her stage name is St. Vincent  She did Lithium  Wow  And what about the  Courtney Love angle?  What happened there?  She came up to speak  And everybody thought  That it was going to be  One of her  Rambling speeches  And apparently  She just  She spoke for a couple minutes  And hugged Dave Grohl  Which was apparently  Like a huge deal  Because they've hated  Each other for 20 years  Right  Did Dave Grohl  Flip his hair around  When he played drums?  Probably  I would assume so  Okay, good 
[01:38:00]  He's the king of that  Yeah  If that's  Front Row Dave  Or whatever his name is  On YouTube  That's the clip  That I was watching earlier  It's not Front Row Dave  But it sounds alright  Okay  Yeah  Where are we starting this?  From the beginning?  Yeah, right there  Alright, let me hear  All this  Oh my god  She's in a pink pantsuit  Pulled up to her fucking chest  That's right  See if Grohl's like 
[01:38:30]  Fuck this  I got my own shit  That's so weird 
[01:39:00]  What else should I say?  What else should I say?  Every word is me  What else should I write?  I don't have a drive  What else should I be?  Oh, I'm part of the peace 
[01:39:30]  In the sun  In the sun  I feel the score  In the sun  In the sun  Mary  Mary  She replaces her R's with B's  She does  She got a speech impediment  Left the brother with a speech impediment 
[01:40:00]  Look at Joan Jett  Still looking like Joan Jett 
[01:40:30]  Yeah  She hasn't changed the look at all, huh?  She was never really attractive  Not really  She's always a little too butchy and shit  Yeah  You know  In the day when you had cute little Pat Benatar  And then you look at Joan Jett and go  She's a little harsh for me  She was the dirty version  She was the filthy version  Of Pat Benatar  That was pretty good  I can't wait to hear a really good copy of that  Yeah  Do we have the Joan Jett doing 
[01:41:00]  Smells Like?  Did we find a good copy of that one, Travis?  Yeah, I just sent Sam  Oh, good  A pretty decent copy  But if he's got one  Sam will just find something on his own  Yeah  Yeah, I mean, whatever he wants to do  He doesn't want to, you know, use yours  Right  Ugh  What happened?  His is all, like, gay  Is it?  I hear you  I found a better one  I hear you  Let's hear a little of this  Very good question coming in from Carrie  In Old Bridge, New York  And Travis is going to answer this question 
[01:41:30]  Yes, he is  Because we were discussing this this morning  Carrie, go ahead  I'm just wondering what the significance  Of all the female singers is  For Nirvana there  I personally think it's because  One, if you were to get male singers  To try and do Kurt  It would be criticized  And it would probably do a disservice  To his, you know, quote, memory  Maybe  Because all the guys would be trying to do  Kurt impressions  And two, he was always very feminine  He would wear dresses 
[01:42:00]  He had no problem admitting  Calling him Dr. Gay  Yeah, I mean, we were kind of, you know  We were very similar  He liked the Stangl brothers  Was bi-coastal, so  Yeah  So I think it was appropriate  What they did  Yeah  He had dual residencies, you're saying?  Ah, mysterious  I don't think he was too mysterious about it  Anyway, let's hear Joan Jett  Doing a little Nirvana  And then we'll move on to other things  I love you!  There you go, Joan baby 
[01:42:30]  Cool  I feel like God jokes  Damn!  Me too  Sorry  This is what we do  There were so many great performances tonight  Yeah, it was such an honor to be on stage  Is that Chris Novoselic?  Shut up  He finally gets to do something  Throw the bass up in the air  So it could hit you in the head again 
[01:43:00]  He doesn't get to do as much as Dave Roll does  No  Oh my God  I wonder if Chris Novoselic looks back and goes  Holy shit, that's the guy from the Foo Fighters  I can't believe I'm playing with him  Why didn't Dave Roll take him when he was starting the Foo Fighters?  What's that about?  Hey, fuck him  Whoa, it's crazy  Look at Dave 
[01:43:30]  Just fucking  He's killing it  Damn  Up 
[01:44:00]  Up  Up  Up  We all know the part we want to hear.  Take a deep breath, Joan. 
[01:44:30]  Yeah, she fell into it.  Not a shaky start, but...  I love watching Dave Grohl on drums.  Yeah, he fucking plays the shit out of it.  The powerhouse, look at him.  The drum kit.  They haven't played those songs in 20 years.  Really? 
[01:45:00]  Yeah, they've never played together since Kurt died.  Like Nirvana songs.  And they probably never will.  She sounded a bit like Courtney Love there, I thought.  Oh, yeah?  That would have been interesting if they had Courtney Love singing.  Oh, I know, I know.  To get that fucking bitch off the fucking stage.  Get that Yoko Ono.  Oh, great.  She kills him and then she's able to sing his songs.  I wish she would do our show today. 
[01:45:30]  Hashtag murderer.  Hashtag bitch.  Hashtag cunt.  Yeah.  That tends to happen on Twitter.  It certainly does.  That tends to happen.  All right.  Oh, and other Rock and Roll Hall of Fame news.  Linda Ronstadt could not be there if she's that sick.  What has she got?  What, she's got the Parkinson's?  Or is it the Parkinson's?  She's got Parkinson's to the point she can't travel anymore.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  Hall and Oates played.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, they were inducted. 
[01:46:00]  Why?  What did they play?  What do you mean, why?  You're a rich girl.  What did they do?  Oh, nice.  I'm not like that.  Sam should know.  I bet you they did man-eater.  My friends wonder why I call you all the time.  What can I say?  Did they do that?  I'm sure not.  Ding, ding, ding, ding.  Ding, ding.  How are you going from awesome Nirvana songs to Hall and Oates?  What?  Come on.  Hey, man.  There wouldn't be a Nirvana without Hall and Oates.  What?  Let's get the word out today, guys.  You make my dream come true. 
[01:46:30]  Woo-hoo.  Woo-hoo.  What's the clapping song?  Private eyes.  Oh, yeah.  They're watching you.  Oh.  Fucked up the clap.  Oh, shit.  I got an observation about Linda Ronstadt.  Uh-oh.  And I kind of wanted to do it while the guy was here, but I think I chickened out at the  time.  Yeah.  There's a picture online of Linda Ronstadt, if you go to Google Images.  Uh-huh.  Go to Google Images with Linda Ronstadt first. 
[01:47:00]  I got a little something on this.  All right.  But I got to show you the exact picture, so you might be in on this.  Linda Ronstadt.  All right.  Go to, uh, let's see.  Linda Ronstadt has intimates.  Go to the, uh, oh, man.  I saw better.  All right.  Keep going.  Keep going.  I got to pick one first before I give you my observation.  Uh, all right.  Now, what era are you going for?  No, you got to go with the fat one.  I'm going to go for a good fat one.  Well, there's plenty of those.  I got an observation. 
[01:47:30]  Um.  Shubsy, ubsy.  Keep going.  She sure was hot.  Go with, uh, hmm.  She was always a little threat of fat.  Even when she was hot and skinny, she had, like, under her teeth.  Go all the way up.  Very cushy.  I've been studying the pictures.  I'm going to go with that one.  All the way over to the left.  No, no.  Go back up.  Back up.  Back up.  Back.  Right there.  Right there.  Okay.  Whoa.  I feel like chubby Linda Ronstadt. 
[01:48:00]  Yeah.  Looks like, uh, Bob Kelly.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Oh, my God.  Do you kind of see it?  Well, yeah.  But I think it might just be the chubby features.  I got to find a better.  There was one picture I saw, and it was a dead ringer.  But I don't see that particular picture yet.  Dude, I've been cheated, been mistreated.  When will I be left, dude? 
[01:48:30]  Maybe if someone could find a better chubby Linda Ronstadt and put it next to Bob Kelly,  you tweet it.  You become a big star today, because we'll all retweet it.  I didn't find the perfect picture for this observation, I must say.  There you go.  All right.  Anyway.  Wow.  Hollow Notes played She's Gone.  She's gone.  Oh, oh, oh.  I've never learned how to fail.  She's gone.  They apparently had to stop halfway through, because there was just terrible feedback.  Oh, good.  Oh, boy. 
[01:49:00]  Oh, that's embarrassing.  That was the only song they did?  I believe so.  She's gone.  It's a great song, Sam.  I don't think so.  You'll love it when Jay-Z starts with, she's gone.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, she's gone.  She's gone.  Yeah, yeah.  She's gone.  To learn how to face it.  Right.  Yeah.  That doesn't sound too bad.  There you go.  That's Bob Kelly.  I'm telling you.  I'll get people on board. 
[01:49:30]  I'm not worried.  I'll work this one out.  I'm not worried.  I'm not worried.  Ah, shit.  Oh, they also did I Can't Go For That.  No can do?  I can't go for that.  No can do.  No can do.  No can do.  No can do.  No can do.  Oh, they also did You Make My Dreams Come True.  Ugh.  What?  They suck.  They don't suck.  They have way more hits than Jay-Z ever had.  I don't know.  Mm-hmm.  That's the horrible feedback. 
[01:50:00]  She's gone.  Oh, what?  Oh, what?  I've never learned to be a sheet.  She's gone.  Oh, what?  Oh, what?  I've been to death and to the bridge.  She's gone.  Oh, what?  I've never learned to be a sheet.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  This is a terribly slow version.  Yeah.  Where's the horrible feedback? 
[01:50:30]  Yeah.  Oh, what?  We got to sit through a fucking sax solo?  It's a 19-minute video.  Oh, my God.  You're kidding.  I'm not kidding.  Oh, screw that.  Leave it to the Hall & Oates fan to pull up a 19-minute video.  Ah.  Way to go, Sam.  Way to go.  You just wanted to hear 19 minutes of Hall & Oates.  Way to go.  Yeah, we know.  Why was Opie and Anthony at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame?  Anyone else see him there?  I didn't know you were in.  Insert ridiculous. 
[01:51:00]  Doesn't even apply.  Holy fuck.  I don't even know why we post pictures anymore.  I didn't know you.  Here it is.  Yeah, it's great.  Funny joke.  Fantastic.  AIDS.  But we love you.  Yeah.  We love all of you.  You're all wonderful.  You're just wonderful.  You're a joy.  You're holding us hostage.  You let us go.  You treat every day as a treat with you people.  Just let us go already. 
[01:51:30]  I've held us hostage for over 10 years.  Holy shit.  Oh, whew.  Anyway.  So, all right.  That sounds like a successful Rock and Roll Hall of Fame evening.  The whole thing will be on HBO soon.  That'll be great to watch.  Yeah, like end of May, I think.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm going to DVR just the part with all of the East Street Band members giving their speeches.  Maybe HBO will keep that in.  Wow.  You think that'll hit the editing room floor?  Oh, boy, will it. 
[01:52:00]  Will it ever.  Oh, boy, will it.  So, we got this Debbie Irving, author of The Cycle of White, talks about her whiteness.  Her whiteness.  She was on MSNBC with Torre and the gang.  Well, any racial discussion on MSNBC is going to be black people saying that white people and slavery are the reason why there's any ills in the black community.  And white people saying that white people are the reason there are any ills in the black community.  Right.  It's just this white guilt thing. 
[01:52:30]  And that's almost like black people saying racist at this point.  It's calling people, saying people have white guilt.  It sounds like, you know, just a catchphrase-y kind of a thing.  But it does exist.  And it's despicable to watch when you see somebody groveling.  Welcome, Debbie Irving, the author of Waking Up White.  Debbie, now that you are aware of your whiteness, what does it mean?  See, it's funny you laugh.  It feels hard to say, right?  It feels hard to say, right? 
[01:53:00]  It's funny you laugh.  Because if I ask the black guests, what does it mean to be black, that would be normal.  But to ask you, what does it mean to be white?  That sounds funny, but real question.  Well, you know, what it means is that I, my entire childhood I see in a different light.  So the town I grew up in was a very white town, and I see that that town couldn't have been white unless black people were intentionally obstructed.  So being white means being able to think through my entire life before, now, and in the future in a much broader context 
[01:53:30]  and be able to make decisions and engage in a much more racially, culturally competent way.  I can't do this today.  I can't do this today.  Shut up.  Shut up.  I grew up in an incredibly white town.  Yes.  I had absolutely no fucking privileges.  Right.  We were dirt poor, and no one gave a fuck about our poorness.  Your plight.  No one cared.  No one cared.  We had to fucking, you know, dig ourselves out of us.  Yes. 
[01:54:00]  Are you kidding me?  White privilege.  I had all sorts of grunt jobs and whatnot.  It had nothing to do with your skin color.  You were, you know, your family was squeaking by and, you know, you're cutting corners.  You're making things work.  That was it.  This woman.  I think what I meant when we said that aha moment on the back of the book was I ended up at the age of 48 taking a course at Wheelock College called Racial and Cultural Identity.  And it was, I was going, because I was an elementary school teacher, I was going to learn about other people. 
[01:54:30]  48 was when she got her first dose of black cock, I think, is exactly what happened there.  She fucking decided that she was going to, you know, she was going to venture out, take some African studies or something.  Well, have fun.  Races in their culture so I could help teach them better.  And in the first class, the teacher, the professor said, you know, what's going to be really hard is you're going to be doing a deep dive into your own racial identity. 
[01:55:00]  Because I did not know.  I really didn't think white was a race.  I thought it was just normal.  And six months later, what I had learned about the racialized experiences I had had from the day I was probably before I was born, actually, and the way it had disabled me as a teacher and a member of society.  I was so thunderstruck by the information I'd gotten that that's why I decided to write the book.  She was disabled as a teacher because of her whiteness. 
[01:55:30]  I don't even really know what the fuck she's babbling about here.  I think I got it.  I think the fact that she was white made it so she couldn't even fucking understand anyone else until, you know, she goes to this class when she's 48 and gets indoctrinated with revisionist history and propaganda.  And this is one of those women that would fall into a cult very easily, just brainwashed. 
[01:56:00]  And then she gets out there and now she's got this self-hatred of this mythical white privilege.  People should just be proud.  Whatever, right?  If you're white, be proud.  If you're black, be proud.  Why can't white people be proud of all the Europeans have brought to the world?  All that the white race has brought to the world as far as innovation, art, technology, all that fun stuff. 
[01:56:30]  But you can't because then you're a white supremacist or a racist.  Tom, if you're black, you could wear a medallion around your neck that says that you're, you know, one of the 5% and white people are the devil.  Who does that?  Jay-Z.  Yeah, I heard about that.  Of course, of course.  It would be like wearing a Klan medal.  What he wore, would it be exactly like wearing a Ku Klux Klan medal around your neck at a baseball game or something if you're a celebrity and people are going, what the fuck is he wearing? 
[01:57:00]  Black people are, and then just list all the things you hate about them because that's exactly what Jay-Z is doing.  A giant gold medallion with this, all this listing of how white people are the devil, black people are the 5%, they're brilliant, they're artists, they're astronauts, they're the greatest thing ever.  Right.  Could you imagine?  Are you trying to say there's a bit of a double standard?  Once again, yes. 
[01:57:30]  Oh, my God.  The celebrity, the white celebrity would be crucified.  Who are you?  What's that old guy?  I don't know.  He doesn't hear me.  A scientist or a cook?  All right.  I don't know.  That's funny.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Tom, what do you got on this in Indiana?  Hey, how you guys doing?  Yeah, I just wanted to talk about that a little bit.  It's just disgusting how they're handed everything, and, you know, guys like me, I got to get up. 
[01:58:00]  I'm a white guy, four years old, got to get up at 5 o'clock in the morning, drive an hour and a half to Chicago to work.  Wow.  And you just watch them all wander around at 9 o'clock in the morning outside the liquor store, not doing anything.  It just irritates the hell out of me, and I see this stuff, and I see, like, Anthony says, you know, these guys have to apologize for things they say, but you're just speaking the truth.  I see it every day.  Yeah, you're not allowed to, though. 
[01:58:30]  You can't point things out.  I'm trying to think throughout my whole life if I ever got anything because I was white, and I swear to you, I can't think of anything.  No, no.  I really can't.  I know I never did.  No, nothing gets handed to you.  You don't get this white fucking little package, you know, the white fucking introduction to white life package that sets you up for life.  That doesn't happen.  I got to work my ass off, man, like everyone else out there.  In the end, you just got to work your ass off. 
[01:59:00]  What is that thing, Sam?  No, it's the 5%er.  5%er.  What is a 5%er?  I don't even know that much.  What's their, like, philosophy?  Yeah.  What is the 5%er?  What's their philosophy, Sam?  I believe it's that we all came from black people and they're the kings.  Uh-huh.  What happened to that whole, we're kings and princes and queens?  How did we get so white if we came from black people, though?  No, we kept going north.  The 5% nation...  What, did they start having sex with albinos or something?  I guess so. 
[01:59:30]  Something like that.  How did we get this white if we all came from black people?  The 5% nation is an offshoot of the nation of Islam that preaches that black people are  the fathers and mothers of civilization.  Mm-hmm.  The Christian God...  Then what happened?  Then what happened to civilization?  The Christian God is nothing more than a ghost.  And more shockingly, that white men are the devil.  Yeah, of course we are.  When a reporter asked if the 5% medallion held any meaning for him, Jay shrugged and said,  a little bit, say, fuck him, boycott, don't buy his albums, wake up white people. 
[02:00:00]  They're so fucking good, though, that's a part of them.  Yeah.  Well, whatever.  She continues as Debbie Broad.  Now, this is the other thing, is that cross-racial friendships can be very hard because people  of color are taught not to talk about race to white people.  White people are not even, we're just taught not to talk about race.  Right.  And if a person of color did talk to me, I would often just say, oh, boy, I'm  must be making that up or imagining things.  That stuff can't happen in America. 
[02:00:30]  I have friends today who still clench up when they see a police car or a policeman.  Whereas for me, it's like, oh, friendly person.  I don't think that.  I don't think that.  I don't think that either.  I clench up because I know I was just doing 90s.  Right.  I know tickets coming my way.  I don't think that.  I drive around the city a lot lately, and when I see a cop, 10 and 2, I'm all about it.  That's it.  I don't think, oh, you know, a good person.  And we're friends with a lot of the NYPD.  Of course.  Just because of the type of job we have. 
[02:01:00]  But I'm fully aware when a cop is around.  Fully aware.  If I'm on a highway and that cop is pulling up on me, I'm like, oh, shit.  Get over immediately and let him do whatever he wants to do.  If a cop is a little more suspicious of a black guy in a car and treats him a little differently, whose fault is that, really?  If a cop's driving around Newark and he pulls a black guy over in a car, why do you think he's a little more cautious and a little more aggressive with that driver than he might be with a white driver? 
[02:01:30]  Could it be that he's a racist and sees all black people as criminals?  Or could it be that in his work environment, 90% of the people that he's dealing with that are fuckheads are of the same ethnic background of the driver he just pulled over?  Could that possibly be it?  And the other side of that, to add just something slightly newer to that discussion, it makes it sound like us white people, when we're out there driving, it's all willy-nilly.  We just wink to the cops. 
[02:02:00]  Oh, God.  A cop, he's never going to pull me over.  And we're just swerving.  And we're on our cell phones and no seatbelt and speeding.  Yeah, let me tell you a little story.  Are you kidding me?  I got pulled over the other day.  I was doing 110 down the expressway.  And the cop came up to the window and he goes, license, register.  I'm just kidding.  Get out of here.  And then he kind of put his arm next to mine and went, yeah.  Right.  Compared to skin color.  And then I just went.  It was great.  Yeah.  There is such just excuse making. 
[02:02:30]  And it's white women and men like this fucking bitch that just perpetuates it.  This maternalistic bullshit that she's preaching.  This we must understand.  And there's an understanding in this culture.  You act like a human being.  You get treated like a human being.  You contribute.  And you join in with society.  You contribute.  You become part of society. 
[02:03:00]  A constructive member.  And you respect people and things.  That's it.  And life.  We got a guy that says, I'd like to talk to these characters.  Ah.  Hello, sir.  Hi, guys.  Colin Quinn.  What's up?  Colin.  How are you, buddy?  Well, I'm good.  Yeah.  And, as I said, the world's longest unaccepted apology continues.  Exactly.  In the racial recession. 
[02:03:30]  Yes.  It's just the longest unaccepted apology.  I like that.  The thing that infuriates me the most is the amount of white people jumping ship on being white.  Yes.  And going, yes, these white people.  Ha, ha, ha.  Please love me.  Right.  I'm one of the good ones.  Ha, ha, ha.  Yes.  Look at me.  I understand.  My innate racism, I accept, I do a...  I know.  Yes.  It's just this ingrained...  For some reason, white people can have an inherent racism. 
[02:04:00]  It's like in our DNA when you talk to these people and when these people go on these shows  and just apologize for their own whiteness.  That is acceptable to say that.  But if you then in turn said that there's an innate disposition for violence in the black community,  now you're a racist who's generalizing everything.  But these are the same people that say that 100% of white people have some form of racism embedded in them. 
[02:04:30]  Yeah.  50% of white people say it.  That's the other thing.  Yes, and that's it.  50% of white people will say that, too.  I think you need a whiteness studies class.  Yes.  A white study class.  I like it.  Well, one of the more important things, guys, I hate to ask favors.  Can I get four tickets to the unmanned?  Now, we need to know who you're taking.  One for me and then three for some friends of mine.  I got to know who the friends are you're taking, though.  Are they, Colin?  Let's say it's as many people.  Are they bothering you? 
[02:05:00]  I would love to know that Lady Diablo are bothering the shit out of you for taking it.  Harassing Colin.  I hope they're doing that.  I love it.  Oh, shit.  Colin, Colin, I need tickets to the U.K. Bears.  Oh, that poor bastard.  Oh, Colin.  Hey, there's another clip from this Debbie broad, and I want Colin to stay on the line, 
[02:05:30]  because she says she talks about the right context for racial humor.  Oh, okay.  Let's look at that context there.  And being a fine, you're one of those funny men.  Maybe you could learn something, Paul.  I want somebody to tell me my parameters, please.  Listen to this clip, please.  Do you think laughter is a tool that could be hurtful, or can it bring people together?  Well, I think it's all about the context.  I mean, you have to laugh. 
[02:06:00]  But laughing at, like a joke, at the expense of another person, to me, there's nothing funny about that,  because what that does...  Oh, jokes at the expense of...  Oh, thank you!  Thank you!  You beat me by a half a second.  I stopped the audio.  Colin's biting his hand at that one.  That's what comedy is.  Yes.  Every time you laugh, it's at someone's expense.  Somebody gets it.  That's it.  But you're not supposed to punch down.  That's the other new expression.  Oh, really?  Is that it?  Name one? 
[02:06:30]  Fucking joke where someone...  It's not at someone's expense.  Exactly.  Okay, let her continue here.  The chicken crossing the road?  Is it the chicken's expense?  To get to the other side.  That joke is at no one's expense.  Well, then you ruined my point.  You just completely ruined my point.  It's not funny, but...  I think it commodifies the chicken.  It does.  Okay, you're right.  You're right.  Right.  It's like, the chicken's so stupid and so useless, 
[02:07:00]  he doesn't even have any reason for going to the other side of the street.  So why would he take that chance?  Why would he go just to get to the other side?  Because he's stupid.  Because he's a dumbbell.  To get his fucking welfare check.  Right.  Easy.  Easy.  All right, here's the rest of her clip on that.  God, just an uninformed white broad on TV.  Yay.  Because what that does is it perpetuates stereotypes, and it makes it, and again, this goes back to who's been, we've been taught to stay in our social roles.  So if a person, and whether we're talking about race or class or religion or whoever's the butt of that joke, if they're in the room and they hear it, if they speak up and say something, they're marked as overly sensitive. 
[02:07:30]  And so it's not a fair exchange.  And so I would say, you know, it's about the context.  It's a great point.  Absolutely.  It's not a great point.  Did you hear them in the background?  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Oh, my God.  Uh-huh.  Stay out of the comedy clubs, Debbie.  What a fucking... 
[02:08:00]  You don't know what funny is.  She's sitting there in front of two black people, apologizing for her whiteness.  Right.  What's it on?  Huh?  Oh, MSNBC, of course.  Oh, yeah.  I believe, yeah.  Of course.  Oh, my God.  Too bad if that person's in the room.  Too bad.  Then that person should go around and slam the other guy.  He should have the fucking ability or get the fuck out of the room.  Right.  Well, the point is, they act like, yeah, if you make that enough times, it leads towards what? 
[02:08:30]  Genocide of somebody?  Yes.  In person.  Depersonalize them.  You know, at some point, humanity has to be trusted.  But these...  And the description she gave leaves no room at all for context.  Like she said, well, in the right context.  But then she describes a situation where that's everything about comedy.  So there's nothing left for a context where you can use race or religion or what have you in a joke or humor. 
[02:09:00]  Well, unless, of course, you know, obviously there'll be a standard, you know, some kind of a board of context which are like-minded people can be in charge and decide what's funny.  In other words, black people making fun of white people.  Well, that...  There you go.  It wouldn't even enter the kind of...  Nah, that's completely acceptable.  It's almost like the cultural revolution, you know?  Yeah, yeah.  We'll have a committee that will decide what's appropriate, you know?  Oh, God.  I've had it.  It's unbelievable.  I've had it.  It really is unbelievable.  They say so many things, you know, right out of, like, Orwell. 
[02:09:30]  Yes!  They notice, and they never notice.  I mean, it's constant.  It is constant.  Yes.  Non-stop.  It is so Orwellian.  Boy, Colin brings up great points.  God damn it.  Thanks, guys.  It pains me to say this, but the guy is brilliant.  He is.  He knows when you say this.  It's painful, but I have to say it.  Carl, where are you going to be?  I'm going to...  Well, I want tickets to the name Orbani. 
[02:10:00]  Carlson.  And I don't know Mary in flesh.  We're all on our...  We're all on the edge of our seats waiting for the next Colin Quinn idea for the Opinant  Anthony show, because Lady Di as an Intern was a big hit, to be honest with you.  I'll be...  You know, it was loved and hated.  Actually, a lot of people were very vicious about how much they hated it.  Well, they got him listening, though.  Yep.  So, sure.  And she looked...  You know, I just had this whole vision of her in a cute little skirt, like, you know,  she just...  The best was after day one, she wasn't allowed to use the bathrooms anymore. 
[02:10:30]  That's the ugly, ugly Betty.  Ugly Betty was in there.  Ugly Betty was in there.  Very upset.  But she doesn't believe in puking in toilets, only in sinks.  Yeah, yeah.  In a public space where people are coming...  What the fuck?  Toilets are very...  With her.  Number one and two, and puking is for...  I mean, it's set up physically for puking.  Right.  It's more than toilets.  And then she shit her pants, and instead of changing in the stall, she decided she had  to do it near the sinks. 
[02:11:00]  Yeah.  Oh, God.  Well, even that makes it kind of, you know, kind of a sense in a way.  Of course.  Right.  Right.  Of course it does.  Well, we look forward to the next Colin Quinn idea.  Thanks, guys.  Yes, Carl.  Thank you.  Thanks for the call, Carl.  Yes.  See you later.  All right.  Colin Quinn.  And I am Colin Quinn on Twitter.  One of the best out there.  He's such a fun guy to fucking just hang out with.  Yeah.  He's just funny.  God.  Let's go to Dave in North Carolina.  Dave.  Dave.  Hey, how you doing?  Hi.  Hey, I'm a cop down here, and I'm sure Anthony's heard of the Fur 3 Seconds class, the Identify 
[02:11:30]  Armed Subjects.  Uh-huh.  Well, during our training, they actually saw fit to cancel the Fur 3 Seconds class based  off of yoga study to give us two days of racial sensitivity training.  There you go.  It was two days of trying to instill white guilt, where I thought it was hilarious, because  I actually learned from you guys, they were quoting Al Sharpton about how the Africans built 
[02:12:00]  America, and they built the pyramids, and how they're all kings and queens.  Yeah, that's the Al Sharpton thing that he used to do years ago.  He'd talk about that.  That's when he said when those Greek homos were still living in caves, Africans were, you  know, building a society and whatnot.  I don't know what happened to that society.  I guess it turned into, you know, shit, but whatever.  Well, it did.  Yeah, but our king of command thought it was fit to remove something that could possibly 
[02:12:30]  save our lives, to teach us racial sensitivity.  There you go.  And recently, our training for minoritual sensitivity for juveniles was mandatory as  well online, and all the pictures in the PowerPoint were of all white kids.  So in their own training, they were so racial sensitive to minorities that in the photos  they had to be all white people.  Well, you'll see that in the news a lot, too, and in commercials. 
[02:13:00]  Like, we talk about the alarm commercials.  You'll see the burglar in the house breaking the window, and it's always a white guy.  And you'll see it on the news, the graphic that goes up in the corner before they actually  go to maybe the video clip of the story, and they talk about a murder or a knifing, a stabbing,  a shooting.  It'll always be an animation of a white hand holding the gun.  The graphic is always white people.  It's dishonest.  It's overly compensating for what the truth of the matter is. 
[02:13:30]  Yeah, I mean...  You see it all the time.  At the very least, mix it up.  Mix it up, right.  Mix it up a little bit.  At the very least, mix it up.  Because...  Yeah.  Just do something like that.  By the way, Obama is in New York City today.  Oh, shit.  He is speaking...  Where?  ...at Reverend Al's National Action Network group.  He's going to have...  He actually gives the time of day to this phony, lying, rat, race-baiting fuckstick. 
[02:14:00]  The president, the president of the United States gives the time to fucking Al Sharpton.  You would think with all the headlines about Reverend Al Sharpton that he would back off  at least.  Nope.  That's amazing.  Wouldn't you think?  You would think at the very least you would back off and go, look, I'll...  Let this calm down a little bit and then I'll come to New York.  Oh, there'll be hands shaking.  Amazing.  Back patting.  I didn't know that was going on.  Smiles.  And all with this fucking rat. 
[02:14:30]  This fink.  Being a...  Phony.  Being a crybaby liberal, it pains me to say this.  I bet.  That, you know, my boy Obama shouldn't be doing that.  That's true.  But I will tell you this.  I'm buying this white book from this Debbie.  Yeah.  This Debbie lady.  Yeah, that sounds great.  That's a good book, right?  Oh, God.  The white book.  Sounds horrendous.  She talks about how awful it is to have to be white and how insensitive it is to just  come out of the womb as a white person. 
[02:15:00]  You're insulting so many people.  She's got to shut up at least about humor.  She has no fucking clue.  These people can't.  They can't shut up about humor.  They feel that they should dictate what is said.  And it works, I was going to say, both ways.  It works always.  Yeah.  You go see a black comic, he's going after Whitey.  Yeah.  And I sit there and laugh just as hard.  If it's funny, it's funny.  I'm a fan of humor.  Right.  If it's a Hispanic comic, the same shit goes down. 
[02:15:30]  Asian, all across the board.  It's funny.  Funny is funny.  Doesn't matter.  Funny is funny.  What the subject is, as long as it's funny.  And we've said it over the years.  There are things that we joke about on this very show.  Daily basis.  That affects us personally.  Yes.  There are things that cut deep.  Right.  But you can't be like that.  But you've got to know that if something is funny, it's just going to transcend all that  shit.  Right.  And make people laugh and that's it.  Right.  Oh, God.  That's a period. 
[02:16:00]  Oversensitivity of this fucking woman who's going through a midlife crisis and overthinking  her whiteness and life and shut up.  Right.  Is Dan Soder here?  Yes.  All right.  Dan's going to join the show next.  I do have a little plug.  Hey.  Anthony, yesterday on the show, described Roots in 90 seconds.  Oh.  And it came out of nowhere.  I've got to be honest with you.  Like all of a sudden we're going to break and you're like, oh, I saw Roots.  Yeah, I was watching Roots.  And then you came up with, you basically described the whole miniseries in 90 seconds. 
[02:16:30]  Yeah.  And one of my pals put together an amazing video of it.  He did.  An amazing video.  I did not edit this one.  I like it.  I wish I did, to be honest with you.  It's great.  But it's on my YouTube channel.  I think it's on our Facebook page by now, hopefully.  Yeah.  Or it will be.  I'm going to retweet it.  It's called Roots in 90 Seconds, the Opie and Anthony show.  It's on my YouTube channel, Opie Radio.  Did you tweet it?  I think I, did I tweet it this morning?  I hope so, because I'll retweet your tweet tweet. 
[02:17:00]  Yeah, I did retweet it this morning during break.  Duh.  Okay.  So it's on my Twitter, Opie Radio.  And Ant's Twitter is Anthony Cumia.  But it's great.  It really is a very, very.  You did a good job.  Well, well done.  Popping all the stuff.  Oh, there it is.  Here we go.  Retweet.  So check it out and retweet it if you like it.  But it's Roots in 90 Seconds.  And there you go.  That's my little plug for tonight.  Nice.  And T-shirts.  You'll get your shirts soon.  I didn't expect the demand.  Such demand.  I'm flattered by the demand as far as a dumb old saying goes on a T-shirt. 
[02:17:30]  I thought it was going to be a goof, but we're starting to make the shirts now.  So give me another week, please, before you completely fucking lose your shit.  Dan Soder next.  Stay there.  We'll be back with more Opie and Anthony.  Thank you.  Thank you.  To let, to let, to let, to let, to let me.  Your ears.  On Sirius XM.

[02:27:30]  With Doug from the O&A Vaults, this is a 20th anniversary O&A Radio Gem.  What's the cinnamon challenge?  You've got to give it to him if he really needs it.  We can't have any of the show.  It's supposed to be a tablespoon.  Just give him a teaspoon.  Let's see what this does.  We're not going to use the little sprinkle.  That will take nine days to get it on the front.  Nine days.  Ready?  One, two, three.  Go.  Okay.  E-Rock is attempting. 
[02:28:00]  You're right, E-Rock.  Smoke is coming out of him.  He's smoking.  What is he doing?  You're right, E-Rock.  He's like that old wrestler.  Water, you asshole.  Holy shit.  A whole cloud came out.  Drink a little water.  Inhale.  Breathe slow.  Water, water, water, water.  Breathe slow.  Through your nose, fuckface.  You're right.  It's too.  Breathe water. 
[02:28:30]  Drink water.  This is the most horrible thing I've ever seen.  He's going to drink water.  Drink water.  Drink water.  Drink a little water.  Something just came out of his forehead.  You okay?  Water just came out of his forehead.  E-Rock.  Water.  It smells so nice in here, though.  It does.  It smells like cinnamon toast.  It smells like Christmas.  It was a cloud of cinnamon that went across the room.  E-Rock.  Give us a thumbs up if you're all right. 
[02:29:00]  Shut up.  Holy shit.  E-Rock, we just want to make sure you're okay.  You can't breathe.  He's breathing all right.  Just slowly.  Very slowly.  You gotta do it.  Slowly.  It's like mustard gas.  Take a little bit of water.  Just a little in your mouth.  A little in your mouth.  A little sip.  A little sip.  Yeah, someone get him a napkin.  Are you puking?  We'll just gargle and spit the water out.  Yeah, gargle and spit the water out.  Very slow breaths. 
[02:29:30]  You have to breathe like you're giving birth.  Like that.  Holy shit.  Dude, that was fucking bad.  All right.  Just breathe.  Wow, man.  Just breathe.  What the fuck is that stuff?  I never heard of that.  What does that do?  I can't.  Do you want to do it again?  What's the matter?  Let him.  Let him. 
[02:30:00]  Wow.  Shut up.  Nasty, man.  That is bad.  You all right, E-Rock?  What a weird reaction that is.  I would never have fucked up.  See, even the water.  He can't drink water because the cinnamon keeps going down.  But you know what?  This is the weird thing is that this cures cancer.  Well, if you do this once, you'll always, no, seriously.  You'll be immune to cancer.  Shut up.  Well, once again, it doesn't work. 
[02:30:30]  You can't, you can't do that.  You can't eat cinnamon.  Wait, you know what?  Before we decided, did he really try now?  Shut the fuck up.  Yes, he did.  The Opie and Anthony Show is back on Sirius XM.  It's Friday.  Dan Soder in studio.  Hey, guys.  We like Dan a lot. 
[02:31:00]  Thank you.  He's blowing up, too, man.  So, we're going to use him for, you know, off and off for the next few months, and then  we'll never see him again.  He'll be gone.  Disguard me like a used condom.  I'm fine with it.  He'll be gone, though.  You got Conan Tuesday, huh?  Conan on Tuesday.  Nice.  Guy code on Wednesday.  Oh.  Teaching the dudes about being the dudes.  About chicks.  About chicks.  About muffins.  How to handle it.  And how to get into their panties.  It's a fun show. 
[02:31:30]  I'm sure he'd bring the humor.  In the right context, I hope.  Yeah.  Because humor in the wrong context is just hurtful.  It is.  We learned that today.  I mean, I've been reading about it.  I just read a tragic article about a young lady who was cursed out by Jon Stewart on Salon.com.  Wow.  I stopped everything I was doing.  I'm good.  I immediately went to my DVR.  Stopped recording The Daily Show.  Because this young lady pointed out that the warm-up comic used ethnic humor. 
[02:32:00]  Wow.  She asked Jon Stewart about it, and he cursed her out by saying, it's fucking funny.  Oh.  Did he really do that?  Yeah.  So that's cursing her out.  Yeah.  That's stupid.  That's fucking funny.  I was so fired up yesterday reading this article.  Wow.  Wow.  Yeah.  You know what, though?  That's his dumb fuck liberal audience that goes to that show and applauds all the lib shit.  You know what I love about it, though?  Wow.  The most proud I've ever been in my life, I went to the comment section, and someone, 
[02:32:30]  I've never been more proud of a friend, someone quoted Kurt Metzger in the comment section  by saying, sensitivity is the enemy of comedy.  Yes.  And if you don't understand that, you're probably not funny.  Quote marks Kurt Metzger.  I was like, yeah!  Yeah, just stay out of the comedy clubs, then.  Yeah.  It's not for you.  Oh, God.  It gets a little ugly in the comedy clubs.  A little ugly.  Yeah.  Anyway.  Anyway.  Oh, God.  PC humor is about to meet the most nutless, grossest thing.  I worry about you guys, because it happened to radio many years ago. 
[02:33:00]  Thank God we have satellite radio.  As much as we bitch about this place, they really do let us just fucking say whatever we  want.  I remember the idea of satellite radio came out, and I was like, what?  What is that?  But they do it in space?  I don't even know what it is.  But they don't really let us have naked girls anymore, and things like that.  All the cool stuff that made us famous, whatever.  It's not on soundstage.  But what I see happening slowly is they're starting to enter the comedy clubs the last 
[02:33:30]  couple of years, and man, I hope you guys are strong enough to fight them off, because  radio just folded.  They just all folded to these fucking assholes.  All the management people and the owners of these radio stations, they all folded, and  everything that was being done on radio was...  Well, you're a radio guy by nature, too.  You did a lot of radio.  The lawyer talks at radio stations were some of the funnest moments, where they bring in  some old guys, like, I've been working in radio for 70 years.  Remember the K-Rock one? 
[02:34:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Either one of you guys had the K-Rock one?  Oh, we pleased...  With the Steves?  Well, you guys probably had...  Steve, we just did not see eye to eye.  You guys probably had a different meeting.  They took the rest of the air staff, and they had this old-timey lawyer in who was telling  us, like, you know, we used to do radio bits where the man would guess what kind of  perfume the girl was wearing.  And we're like, shut up and die!  Hey, no one likes your old fucking Werther's original games.  Garbage, trout, bones.  Is that what she's wearing? 
[02:34:30]  Yeah, she was wearing fucking painful childbirth.  Is that what she was wearing?  It's...  Come...  Bring it to the stand-up world.  That's all I'm saying, because I think the difference is, with radio, you rely on people  to broadcast you.  Yep.  It's not stand-up.  It's just maniacs on stage by themselves.  They have no one to answer to.  But they're slowly getting in there.  And I worry about some of these comedy club owners and stuff folding.  With the radio thing, everything that was being said on the radio was legal.  It followed FCC regulations for the most part. 
[02:35:00]  And that's the only thing that should have mattered.  But these managers and everything just fucking folded and really destroyed regular radio.  And I just hope you guys can stay strong, because they're now slowly going after you guys.  Well, I think they leaned on you guys with advertisers.  They're like, we're going to take away the advertisers.  Then everyone in radio is like, well, we're fucked, because that's how we get our money.  I think stand-up, you're like, what are you going to lean on us?  You're going to bring my dad back from the dead and have a good relationship with me  so I'm not funny on stage?  You fucking asshole. 
[02:35:30]  What a dishonest headline on that Salon article that you just were talking about.  It says,  John Stewart cursed me out.  I dared question a Daily Show warm-up comic's racist joke.  And who was the warm-up comic?  Do we know him?  I don't know.  It might be.  She said this from 2008.  It's David Duke.  This is from 2008?  And it's a story today?  Well, maybe she didn't have a blog back then.  She was scarred that it took her years of regression therapy. 
[02:36:00]  Unbelievable.  I need to know, yeah, who the comic was and what the joke was.  Yeah, what was the joke?  Here's the funny part.  In the article, she said he made fun of a lesbian in a wheelchair.  And I'm like, yeah, because you have to.  What?  Because if you don't.  You're obligated to, yes.  It's like an order of business.  You're like, you have to make fun of that.  A lesbian in a wheelchair?  Oh, my God.  That's made for comedy.  A comic would lose his license like a pilot falling asleep in the comic.  You can't not get on that. 
[02:36:30]  You can't go anywhere with that.  You can't land a book.  A standard operating procedure.  Was the lesbian in the audience?  Yes!  Yeah, you gotta do that.  I mean, Jesus.  Come on.  The numb pussy eating jokes alone.  Oh, yes.  It makes it better if the person's in the room.  You know what it is?  This is what it is.  It's becoming this sackless.  Everyone attacks people online because no one sees their face.  Yeah.  And it's disgusting.  And if the lesbian in the wheelchair was at another function that had nothing to do with comedy, 
[02:37:00]  and then someone just went after her, then maybe.  I'm just saying maybe.  But if you're going to see comedy, all bets are off.  Even if it's a fundraiser for a dead police officer and she's his only living sibling.  Right, right.  Even then, you're like, yeah, I'd still go there.  Yeah, you gotta.  I'd still lean into that one.  You gotta.  Yeah, but this is what it's becoming.  It's becoming people.  Look at how long this article is, too.  She's got so much to say about it.  It's, Anthony, it's her feelings.  She felt like she couldn't.  Everyone laughed when Jon Stewart said that sentence. 
[02:37:30]  How much more liberal does she need Jon Stewart?  She's at the Daily Show with Jon Stewart and it's not quite liberal enough for her.  Holy fuck.  She needs to watch Pandas fucking in order to get there.  What does she need?  How far left does she need to go?  Guys, everyone's the same.  Oh, God.  Pandas fucking with the spotted owl in the tree.  Checking it out.  And even then, I feel like the spotted owl was, that's rape culture because they had to watch it. 
[02:38:00]  It's not seeing something.  It's forcing.  Just push back.  Everybody, just push back.  Especially if you're a fan of comedy.  Go on these sites where these articles are being written and fucking leave your comment.  Please.  See, here's the problem.  This is where we start to lose it because the fans of comedy immediately just go, like,  shut your fucking dumb mouth.  Shut up, dyke.  I'll kill you.  Can you be witty and use ration?  You gotta do a little of that.  Although those comments are fun, too. 
[02:38:30]  But you need someone to get a little intelligence in there as well.  I've laughed my ass off reading the worst, most inappropriate, horrid comments.  And I've just been like, that's hilarious because it's so fucking violent.  My question is always, when someone types something that pure evil into a computer,  like, do they have to get up from the computer and walk around the house?  Because they're like, walk it off a little bit.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  God, I just let all that racism and misogyny boil out of my fingers. 
[02:39:00]  Well, what I do is get a beer.  You have a lovely pool that you float in.  I float around in the pool.  I imagine after one of these haters gives you a good dose on Twitter, they get a nice shot of adrenaline.  I think they are just fucking stoked.  I don't even think it's that.  Or do they look in the mirror and feel a little dirty?  I think it's a smirk.  I think they have like a little corner of their mouth raises up.  Like, I got him.  I was telling...  Because I took a psych class in college. 
[02:39:30]  I know exactly what to write to get to this one.  I showed a little bit of apathy.  And I knew that he's from a broken home.  Right.  And you know what?  God damn it works.  If it wasn't so fucking effective, it would be like, ah, all right.  You can't turn away from it, though.  Let's move on to other things.  Nancy Grace.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Very hateable.  She is hateable.  Extremely hateable.  Well, she said some shitty things on her show yesterday, I guess, or the day before. 
[02:40:00]  And, you know, they want her off.  They started the hashtag, cancel Nancy Grace.  Good.  I'm behind it.  Are you really?  I just can't.  I just can't.  Well, I can't.  Even though I hate her, I don't want people canceled for, you know, saying some shit.  Yeah.  I mean, I think if we...  God damn it.  That's where we are.  The freedom of speech battle right now.  Yeah, we got a lot.  We got to take Nancy Grace on our team.  Well, you got to kind of...  You kind of got to. 
[02:40:30]  Okay.  I mean, it's painful to say, but...  Yeah.  It's like a shot.  You're just like, just put it in my arm.  I don't...  Well, I said it about the Imus thing.  Like, all the black shows, especially.  And honestly, in a lot of the white shows, too, fucking were pussies about the whole nappy-headed hoe thing.  And me and Ant, I will continue down this road, because it was a very important day in broadcasting.  We started yelling, we're like, you guys have to support Imus, because they're going to come after you next, you dopes.  You're going to say something, dummy. 
[02:41:00]  But especially the black shows, we're so excited that it was looking like he was going to be canceled and fired.  And I'm like, and they're suffering now, too, you know, because that changed a lot of the rules.  So you think, give an inch, we're fucked.  Yeah, at this point.  Yeah.  I agree.  And they're like, damn it, Nancy Grace.  Oh, I'll make fun of her and say how much...  And she's so angry.  She's horrible.  She's the worst.  She just takes these people's tragic, these tragic things that happen to people, and then she's like, 
[02:41:30]  It's about me.  I'm going to talk about it.  A little baby was raped, but it reminds me of me.  Hashtag raped, baby.  She loves a good sensational hashtag.  Yeah, white ladies killing their kids.  She flicks her bean, too.  Oh, she loves it.  And her hair, is it gossamer?  Uh, who was the one from Bugs Bunny?  Actually, uh...  I always get that name wrong.  I just saw it the other day.  Was that that big red monster?  And the monster was called something else. 
[02:42:00]  It wasn't God...  What was the name?  I think we did this bit already.  My monster.  And we'd never know the name of that.  She does look like she forces her daughter to participate in child pageants.  Yes.  That's what she looks like.  She's like, you can see a little girl like, I'm a little cowgirl!  And it looks off, and Nancy Grace is doing her guns with her, where she's like, big smile, baby.  Big smile.  Gossamer.  Come on.  No, but it's not gossamer.  It's not gossamer.  It may be in the later episodes, but that first one, where at the end, it's like the ether  breaks, and it's like, nighty-night rabbit peak. 
[02:42:30]  I just Google-imaged gossamer.  There was a name on the door when he opens up the door, and it's a different name.  So why does everyone say gossamer?  And look, in Google Images, it comes up as the character, and that's what her hair looks  like.  But it's not.  It's not?  Come on.  I know.  I just saw it like the other day.  So why does everyone get it wrong?  I think on later episodes, they called him that.  Oh.  But in the beginning, I wish I could remember what the name was.  I don't even know what she said.  Someone will come up with it. 
[02:43:00]  What did she say?  All right.  Well, the ultimate warrior.  Warrior.  Yeah, I can't do a warrior.  I thought you could.  I can do Macho Man.  I can't do a warrior.  Warrior is fucking crazy.  Like, he just snarred.  It was like.  You gotta shout a lot.  Yeah.  Hold it!  Hulk!  Hold it!  It was just like this weird cocaine and steroids.  I hear Andre in there.  Sorry.  I know.  I'll go there.  I'll go there.  By the way, for anybody wanting to know, it was Rudolph.  That was his name.  Really?  Rudolph. 
[02:43:30]  Rudolph.  Yeah.  The monster's name was Rudolph.  When he first made his scene and came out of the closet thing that he kept him in.  He kept him in a fucking cage.  And then he came out.  Rudolph.  And that's when Bugs was like, monsters are such interesting people.  And he put the dynamite in his hair.  All reindeers.  When you go there.  That's why.  All reindeers.  I wonder if they had to change it.  If someone had like a trademark on Rudolph.  Yeah, right?  Oh, brother.  Anyway.  The ultimate warrior died.  It sounded like his heart blew up. 
[02:44:00]  I mean, yeah, man.  You can't.  It might lead towards some drugs, possibly.  You're saying there's no connection to drugs at the moment, but they're awaiting a toxicology report.  But everyone was saying when they saw him at WrestleMania, they all were like, oh, my God.  This guy's on his last leg.  Supposedly when he did his rope thing, he was out of breath.  It was a very, very weak rope shake on Raw.  And you were down at WrestleMania.  You saw him out and about a little bit.  Did he look a little sickly?  I mean, kind of in hindsight.  I don't think anybody was actually saying that when he was not dead. 
[02:44:30]  But in hindsight, you know, yeah, he was blown up and he was beet red.  So you guys were doing like sassy girl shit talking.  We were like, look at the warrior.  He doesn't look that good.  Did you see what warrior's wearing?  I guess it's not designer.  And he's like, I was on cocaine and steroids for over 12.  We were talking about this off air, but I think it's true.  He started doing the voice again. 
[02:45:00]  And I think that's what blew up his fucking heart.  You can't throw yourself into that voice.  Getting that energy going.  You can't do that as a 54-year-old former cocaine.  Right.  And his heart was like, oh, yeah, I'm done.  He's shaking the plaque loose from his arteries.  It was all nice and stuck to the side.  It's like turning the hose on too much after it's just been trickling for a while.  His rust comes out.  His plaque was falling off like when you go see ACDC at NASA Coliseum and all that shit. 
[02:45:30]  Shaking from the ceiling.  All that stuff comes falling from the rafters.  It's been there for 20, 25 years.  And he does his own eulogy in the end.  That's creepy.  Yeah, that's fucked up.  That's the stuff he said.  It's always fucked up.  But here's the thing about Ultimate Warrior.  He always said his own eulogy.  Yeah, I mean, technically every promo could be eulogy.  Every promo, though.  So there was nothing special there.  The only reason this one was creepier was because he died the next day.  And because Ultimate Warrior was talking about Warrior.  Warrior.  And the person. 
[02:46:00]  That was weird on Raw where he goes, I got this, Warrior.  And you're like, what?  No, because people don't understand it to that point.  You should have used your real name for that bit.  But that is his real name.  I understand.  We went over this.  But it would have worked better if he said, John, I got this.  John, was it?  Brian.  Well, it was at one point Jim.  But when he died, he was Warrior.  All right.  But he legally died as Warrior.  Warrior.  But he should have said, Jim, I got this.  Then everyone would have understood.  No, Jim went away a long time ago.  But you can't say, Warrior, I got this, because I'm Ultimate Warrior. 
[02:46:30]  Where's Warrior from?  Parts Unknown.  I don't know.  Maybe a little place called Parts Unknown.  I don't know.  You ever visited him?  That's great.  Just wanted to.  Parts Unknown.  Public schools, they're terrible.  Yeah, not good.  Parts Unknown.  I went to PS...  I went to Parts Unknown.  Yeah, no, I was right over in North Parts Unknown.  You were going down there?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We used to come down to Parts Unknown on the weekends.  P-U-U.  It's a state university.  I went to...  I actually went to East Parts Unknown for high school.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  They had a good football team. 
[02:47:00]  Yeah.  It was from the prominent side of Parts Unknown.  Parts Unknown.  How are you from there?  How did you not know that?  That's a silly question.  Summer brought up a good point, though, that Warrior dying and Undertaker losing the streak  really ended the era of, like, monster wrestlers.  Maybe that's what Vince was gunning for.  And the champion's 5'10 now, so...  Everything's fucked, man.  Oh, man.  Did you see the Photoshop picture going around of how they're burying the Ultimate Warrior?  I don't know, but...  And how they do it, the WWE way. 
[02:47:30]  I should have retweeted that.  Oh, my God, that was bad with the Undertaker.  They have the Undertaker getting ready to...  That wasn't photoshopped.  Uh-huh?  That really happened on the show, but in 91.  It was in 91.  Okay, where he's, you know, slamming them into a coffin.  Into a coffin.  Oh, yeah, it's a coffin match.  Right, right.  It's hilarious, though, because, like, in hindsight, you're like, ah, well...  They probably did do that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, all right.  I felt like they photoshopped the coffin in that picture, okay, but they actually did  it.  I mean, look at...  That was crazy.  Watch any promo that the Warrior did, and you're like, oh, he died of a heart attack? 
[02:48:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, okay.  I could see that.  I'm surprised it didn't happen 10 years ago.  He was one of my favorites when I was watching back in the day.  Oh, yeah.  He was great in the ring.  He was so weird, yeah.  But anyway, Nancy Grace.  Yeah, you're just shoving him in the castle.  Oh, my God.  That picture went around yesterday.  That is so bad.  Yeah.  Oh, fuck.  The one where he's up in the air getting ready to slam him into the coffin.  Yeah, that's the one that was over. 
[02:48:30]  Oh, my God, that's so wrong.  See, I really thought the coffin was photoshopped in that picture.  No, that's...  Right.  That was when he got...  You could see the Warrior logos on the coffin when he got locked in the airtight casket.  You know, I think they keep all that stuff, so they probably have that coffin.  They definitely have it.  They have to use it.  How do you not donate that to his family?  Just put him in this.  We have this coffin from the funeral parlor segment.  You can spend $200,000 on a kiss coffin, or we can just give you the one we had made in 91. 
[02:49:00]  Paul Bearer is there, too, and he's gone.  Paul Bearer is dead, too.  Two out of three are not alive in that picture.  Why don't we play the Nancy Grace...  Oh, yeah, see what she said.  That's right.  So Nancy Grace had a lot to say, because she really knows about the wrestling world.  I mean, she doesn't break kayfabe, ever.  Ever.  I know.  She lives her life as this character, Nancy Grace.  Here we go.  She had Diamond Dallas Page on the show.  What's his issue?  DDP Yoga.  No, DDP Yoga.  He's the fucking man.  Oh, he's the yoga guy now, right.  DDP Yoga.  That's good for him. 
[02:49:30]  I tried the fat burner.  It was a killer.  Here on the set, former pro wrestler, Diamond Dallas Page.  Thank you for being with us.  Thanks for having me on, Nancy.  Now, I don't quite recognize you with all your clothes on, but I'm trying to get past that.  I said you either.  You know, so many wrestlers dead.  Now, accusations of steroids and illegal drugs swirling. 
[02:50:00]  Take a look at wrestlers who died young.  To Dr. John Hong, internal medicine physician.  Owen Hart fell from the roof, you dummy.  Owen Hart 33.  Wait a minute.  Is it true that Owen Hart was on cocaine when he was being slammed into the ground because of a faulty?  You fucking asshole.  You put Owen Hart on that list?  Yeah, but he might have been on drugs when he fell from the ceiling of an arena.  That might have been.  You never know.  But she's got to update her knowledge. 
[02:50:30]  I mean, the wrestling world has really tried to take care of this whole issue that certainly was happening.  Yeah.  By not acknowledging it.  Well, for a long time.  But now, a lot of these older guys have come in and said, they admitted to some crazy shit that was happening in the day.  But now they've got a whole system set up with WWE where these guys can get the help they need.  And they also do drug tests.  They don't want the steroids in there anymore.  I mean, you can see it.  Although it does look like some of the guys still cycle a little bit.  Let's be honest.  A little bit.  But, like, most of the roster doesn't really look like that anymore. 
[02:51:00]  No, they all don't look like monsters anymore.  You're right.  Yeah, you look at, like, the Wyatts.  You look at, like, all these new guys that are coming up.  And they've got, like, a...  A chubby guy.  They've got, like, my torso.  Like, I'm way into wrestling again.  It was...  There's no way to get that body where it's just giant, defined muscles with not a piece of fat between the skin and the muscle tissue.  And they're just glistening...  Are you talking about 24-inch pythons?  Yeah, I think so.  I don't know.  Maybe if you took your prayer...  If you said your prayers and took your vitamins.  And took your vitamins.  And by vitamins, I mean D-balls. 
[02:51:30]  If you hit hard steroids.  I take my vitamins and needle in my ass cheek.  They're called horse...  Yeah, they're called horse hormones, brother.  I'm going to run in a race.  These guys were so jacked up in the 80s.  Oh, God.  In the 80s.  And so...  Just wet.  It was all about it.  Even the jobbers were all, like, roided out.  It was all about it.  But Nancy Grace, I mean, this isn't happening to that extent anymore.  Maybe one or two slipped through. 
[02:52:00]  Maybe.  But you're right.  I like Nancy Grace brings up old issues.  She's like...  She's just, like, 20 years late on this.  She's like...  Steroids!  Wrestling is not real!  I'm finding out right now that these men are not fighting.  Well, these guys...  Who is Buzz Sawyer?  Well, that's the thing.  Like, that's...  And DJ Peterson.  This is what Carter...  This sounds like kids I went to high school with that died in car accidents.  Yeah.  I remember DJ Peterson.  I'm like, DJ's...  Oh, my God.  I got a handjob from DJ's sister.  Not Buzz.  Buzz Sawyer.  I played Lily.  Buzz Sawyer. 
[02:52:30]  Fucking Oyster Bay right by the expressway.  Nah, I still left the gauntlet when I passed it.  Who's Gary Albright?  Who are these people?  She used a bunch...  Secretary of State.  She used a bunch of names that either people weren't really familiar with...  Yeah.  ...or couldn't have died less from steroids.  Right, man.  Just anyone who ever wrestled a match who died in their 30s.  Yeah.  Well, I just gotta make a point, though.  20 years later.  Right, exactly.  If you showed up to the party late, you better have a big list.  Exactly.  And Owen Hart on the list. 
[02:53:00]  That's fucking...  I don't know.  We know this, but yeah, we went over it when Benoit died.  Yeah, we know.  We all know what's happening.  We got it.  Right.  We're still supporting it.  Yeah.  That kind of woke people up in Stanford.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, they said, oh boy, I think we gotta start changing things up a little bit.  He choked out his own kids with his weight.  His weight room.  First things first, let's get to editing some videos.  So he never existed.  And then we'll work on our health problems.  Exactly.  Yeah, that was a page right out of Stalin's book, man. 
[02:53:30]  Like, what?  Nothing happened.  Never existed.  I don't know what you're talking about.  And Owen Hart didn't really have a hint of a muscle in his body.  No.  No.  No.  He was one of the guys that did not look steroids out.  If he was taking steroids, he was being ripped off.  He was getting some fucking powdered sugar.  He was getting a placebo.  He was getting the oregano pot, injecting water into his veins.  They stepped on his shit a little too much.  No, I think it looks bigger.  Oh, this cocaine's really good.  I'm telling you, it's really good.  Whenever they put Owen Hart in baby oil, I was like, don't do that. 
[02:54:00]  It's just fucking mean.  It looks like a baby.  Do you have to get him through a tight space?  I don't know why he's all lathered up.  It's just fucking mean.  What do you want him to do?  Slip out of the harness?  Oh, God.  Oh, he did.  Oh, God.  Oh, no.  I thought it was steroids.  Oh, no.  Wrestlers who died young.  Okay.  A lot of names I really don't know.  Go ahead.  And Kate Riesel Medical Center.  The effect of drugs and steroids after using them from years and years. 
[02:54:30]  Pitbull's dead?  Pitbull number one is fine.  These look like closing credits of an action movie.  Wait, who's Pitbull number?  Pitbull 2, the heretic.  I wish it was the guy you were thinking of.  Pitbull 2, electric boogaloo.  Was that him?  Who's Pitbull number one in wrestling?  I don't know.  Who's Big Dick Dugly?  These are all like...  Big Dick Dugly.  And those are the most famous guys because they wrestled for ECW.  Mark Curtis, Brady Boone?  First off, you're not a Brady Boone guy?  Do you even know who he is?  Sort of? 
[02:55:00]  Barely.  And if I barely know...  Then that's barely on the radar for most wrestling fans.  Hardcore wrestling fans.  Oh my God.  Massive mammal.  Brown bears can weigh up to 1,000 pounds.  Baby bears on Fox News.  They're adorable.  Tell Roland we want the baby bears in here.  Why can't we do this?  We need animal acts here on the show.  Roland, if you're listening, go run over to Fox.  When you see them walking out with the baby bears, say,  Hey, Opie and Anthony want to check them out.  There's got to be a weird security check-in when they're coming for the show. 
[02:55:30]  This is the cage of two bears.  That would make our day if we could hold a baby bear.  Look how cute those fucking things are.  Remember when the guy had the falcon on Fox News and that other guy came in with a squirrel?  Yeah.  And he's like, No!  Falcons eat squirrels!  Oh, that was fucking hilarious.  He chewed the guy's face up.  Is that an otter?  There's an otter.  I'm an otter?  He's adorable, too.  Look, he's wearing a little leash like Beavis.  Oh, I know.  It looks like an alligator, though.  Look how cute an otter is.  When it goes down on the ground, it's like, Dude, I don't trust those fucking things. 
[02:56:00]  Hell no.  He's adorable!  Yeah, but...  That looks like a big rat, though.  Yeah.  Look, this thing getting loose.  He really is kind of rat-like.  Oh, man, he's opening his mouth and going toward the camera.  Those motherfuckers are...  Otter is comical.  What do you mean?  Do they have a sense of humor?  Oh, they're just...  Oh, in context.  Do you think you look less funny right now?  Do you think your humor's racist?  I hope not.  I was offended by an otter, and Jon Stewart cursed me out.  Leave it to the otter to leave.  The blonde guy is just a dope. 
[02:56:30]  And Fox and Friends.  The other guy we had on, he was cool.  Nice beaver.  It's a beaver, and he likes grapes.  Get these animals up here.  I'm sure they want to promote something.  I love animals.  I like that's where Anthony Softspot is.  I hate people, but I do love animals.  You've got a compound with guns out the ass.  You show them a beaver, and you're like, yay!  Look at him.  He's eating grapes with his hands.  We're going to try to get him up here. 
[02:57:00]  I'm telling you right now.  By the way, DJ Peterson died in a motorcycle accident.  Now we're getting the news on a lot of these guys.  But did he hit a steroid factory?  That might have been the tie-in.  Good point.  What happened was the front tire was pierced with a syringe.  Ah, and then he flipped over and had drugs.  And Jose, a guy that really knows these names, he says, most of the people on this list died  from car-slash-motorcycle accidents and cancer.  Wow.  Wow.  That got real.  And so you should only get cancer.  This was not... 
[02:57:30]  And that's the problem, that this was not a list of guys who died from steroids whatsoever.  He just found, find me anyone under 40, who died, who died, put him on a list.  She realized John Stossel got a lot of heat with this in 1988.  So she was like, let me jump on that.  Yeah, but he got slapped in the mouth.  Slapped in his ears.  Row, row!  Rolando!  Bear day!  What's that?  We need animals.  We want animals.  I asked, and they said, you have to have the building's permission first. 
[02:58:00]  Then you can bring the animals up.  It's bears.  They can beat up anybody.  Right.  Come on, let's get this done today.  Two baby bears.  Did you see the otter?  They're right across the street.  It's a fucking otter.  They're gorgeous.  If you don't let them up, I'll release the bears on you.  Yeah.  Just threaten them with the actual animals you want to take up.  Right.  That'd be cool.  With their parents.  Right.  With their parents.  Well, the parents are out in the truck.  If you want to talk to them about their kids.  You ever had your head put inside a bear's mouth?  Because you're about to.  You're discriminating against the bear, not letting him in the building. 
[02:58:30]  You're perpetuating bear culture.  Yes.  You're stereotyping the bear as a killer.  Oh, so you're saying a bear can only live in the woods.  Uh-huh.  That's what you're trying to say.  Oh, sure.  Can you try, though, maybe?  I asked.  You think bears have a penchant for violence?  Maybe hide them in a gym bag or something.  Is this becoming an I Love Lucy thing?  Where you bring them up?  Two bears in a coat.  And like, oh, this is my friend, Dr. Bearstein.  And it's just like.  Roland, what did you do? 
[02:59:00]  That Lucy was always trying to figure some shit out.  Oh, she was so sad.  I can see he bring up for a minute.  Well, Roland.  I think her.  Well, sure, Fred.  We'll get the bears into the club.  Another bear that died from steroids.  Bears are dying from steroids.  She gets her little stories confused.  Has she been misleading or what? 
[02:59:30]  I can't wait for her to go senile.  Why don't we.  I got to make wee.  Make some wee wee and we'll come back.  And we'll do the rest of the Nancy Grace clip.  That has a lot of people very outraged today.  Dan Soder is going to be on Conan on Tuesday.  I highly recommend everyone check out Conan.  Indeed he do.  It pains me to say that.  Because, you know, we don't really have a relationship with Conan like you do.  I don't really.  We never did, actually, which is really strange.  That is weird.  And a lot of our guys don't do Conan for whatever reason.  Really?  Yeah, I don't know what that's about. 
[03:00:00]  Do they have one of those.  I guess he has.  Conan, you don't do this show deal or.  I get a call right after this.  Like, listen.  No, no, no.  You're doing Ferguson.  We switched it.  I'm like, all right.  Whatever.  Just put me on.  But that's cool.  Dan's going to be on Conan on Tuesday.  That's awesome.  And Guy Coates season four premiere April 16th on MTV2 with Dan Soder.  All right.  We'll continue with Nancy Grace in just a bit.  And if, and if.  The Opie and Anthony show will be right back.

[03:09:30]  We've got Dan Soder in studio.  Yeah, hi.  Where's Sam?  We've got to get right back into this Nancy Grace clip.  I don't know.  I just imagine Sam's crying about the warrior in the bathroom.  Yeah.  But he needs those moments where he's like, no, it's not affecting me.  I'm okay.  It's still real to me, David.  It's still real to me.  Sam's got the warrior's logo painted on his chest.  Oh, that would be sad.  I'm surprised Roland doesn't have that shirt. 
[03:10:00]  Roland's slacking.  I've got to tell Dan, this is one of my favorite things that Roland does.  Let's say, oh, Jeremy Lin.  Yeah.  Was a sensation for what?  Two weeks or something?  Linsanity here in New York.  And everyone was talking about him.  Yeah.  Roland comes in with the Linsanity t-shirt.  So he's up to, yeah.  He's one of those guys.  If a team wins the Super Bowl, he's got that jersey the next day.  Oh, man.  And he only wears it for two or three days.  When the Nets announced they were going to Brooklyn, he had the Brooklyn Nets brand new shirt.  Before it even, like, anybody had them. 
[03:10:30]  And we asked him why.  And he goes, because he likes getting high fives on the subway.  He likes the attention.  At least he's honest.  He goes, I like to get high fives.  I get high fives.  So I'm surprised he doesn't have an Ultimate Warrior t-shirt, because that would be a lot  of high fives on the subway.  And it's a special thing that it's kind of, when you admit to liking, people are like,  I like it too.  And you're like, thank God.  Yeah, yeah.  But I've noticed Roland dresses, he dresses in my favorite way, where it's like that  dad that has to pick up his kid that just got suspended. 
[03:11:00]  Like he shows up in sweatpants and a t-shirt, like, it's my day off, Kevin, and you got suspended.  He don't give a shit.  No, I love it.  Little son of a bitch.  Yeah, he really is modern day Mafia, Don.  He's so connected, and we don't understand why, because it's really hard to understand  him at times.  But there's eight listers coming in here that give him a bear hug, like, Roland, what's  up?  I think Roland's like the warden on Midnight Express.  Took his little kids to beat the feet of the fucking...  All right, let's do some Nancy Grace. 
[03:11:30]  So, where were we?  She just started, really, her rant.  She was going over the list of people that she was implying died of steroids, but obviously  did not.  Yeah, back up slightly, just a little bit.  Pitbull the Rapper, number two, apparently.  Ah, Pitbull number two.  Where does the list start, actually?  Because I want to read some of these names.  Mike Von Erich.  23?  23, what the fuck?  Well, the Von Erichs died because everyone knows they're cursed. 
[03:12:00]  There's a lot of Von Erichs, I know that much.  And you're not dying of steroids at 23.  23 is when you think that you're invincible and can handle it.  Yeah, you don't get hangovers at 23.  Right.  Who's Art Barr?  Art Barr.  That's a guy that my mom dated.  Art Barr.  This is mom's friend, Art.  Fucking, you don't remember Artie Barr.  We fucking...  It's the drink with the guy.  Rick McGraw.  Do you know any of these names, Sam?  I don't know Rick McGraw.  I know Mad Dog Buzz Sawyer.  All right, let's go with the list.  All right, let's go.  Here we go. 
[03:12:30]  Take a look at wrestlers who died young.  To Dr. John Hong, internal medicine physician, Cape Regional Medical Center, the effect of  drugs and steroids after using them from years and years sticks with you.  Years and years.  Years and years.  Some of these...  They're 20s.  Right.  You're just talking about how they're dying early.  The steroid deaths come in like the late 40s, early 50s for these guys.  Right.  Years and years.  What did they start when they were 12?  Yeah.  I would like if Nancy broke and actually went with wrestling and she's like, cocaine and 
[03:13:00]  steroids leads into a bunch of great wrestling promos.  Yes.  That's why The Undertaker got off.  It was actually entertaining.  Yeah.  By the way.  Yeah.  This referee here.  Boy, the way.  Boy, the way.  This is...  He's on the list.  Under his wrestling name, Mark Curtis.  Uh-huh.  He's a referee whose arms look like strands of spaghetti.  Yeah.  What happened to him?  How did he die?  He had cancer.  Oh.  See, this is...  Oh, my God. 
[03:13:30]  There's nothing about him.  He's despicable.  He's got my frame.  Yeah.  Where she just doesn't do any research.  She had his disease.  She's a bit misleading.  Yeah.  Maybe.  A little bit.  You're finding another one?  Well, Brady Boone might have...  Might have...  I'll look at him.  Oh, my God.  Okay.  He might have been on a cycle or two.  Bulked up a little bit.  Brady Boone, bad example.  I mean, that dude is...  Oh, shit.  Look at his fucking...  Look at one of those deltoids.  She might have a point on Brady Boone. 
[03:14:00]  Brady Boone's neither here nor there.  Let's go back to Mark Curtis.  Yeah, let's...  Wow.  Okay.  Continue.  We're Brady Boone.  Right, Doctor?  Absolutely.  Oh, yeah.  And then she brings...  Absolutely.  Look at this dude.  Absolutely.  You bring a greater dishonor to wrestling.  This is another guy.  That's not...  He didn't die a royce.  Does this guy look like he's on steroids?  No.  He looks like Guy Fieri's brother.  It's Johnny Grunge from The Public Enemy. 
[03:14:30]  Johnny Grunge.  Johnny Grunge.  What happened to Johnny Grunge?  I don't know, but he wasn't steroid.  Of course not.  He's definitely fat.  I would say some kind of cardiopulmonary disease.  That's in his prime.  He had to wrestle in a hockey jersey.  He didn't have the physique.  A hockey jersey will cover up some shit.  He's got a fucking fat guy in a beach body.  And he's like, can I swim in my t-shirt?  And they're like, he died of steroids.  This is his WCW promo shot.  Johnny, I remember Public Enemy.  You know who else dresses in a hockey jersey? 
[03:15:00]  Our buddy Kevin.  I wasn't going to bring that up.  But Kevin knows he's a little overweight.  I thought I made my point without having to...  You know, point out individuals.  But Kevin wears a hockey jersey, too.  Right.  Because, you know, he knows he's overweight.  I don't think it's any surprise.  I would love to see Kevin lose some weight.  But, you know, in the meantime, the hockey jersey.  Johnny Grunge looks like 90% of our listeners.  Wow.  He looks like women.  If you had to build the ultimate Opie Anthony listener, it would be Johnny Grunge.  So you start with that body?  Yeah, start with that body. 
[03:15:30]  If we wanted to make an ONA listener action figure, that's a lack of action figure.  And you build your character for a video game.  That's the number one body you start with.  Yes.  You've got to go with that body.  And then you can add a Paramus accent.  You've got to start building up.  You've got to add some type of goatee.  Let me picture it.  I've got the goatee, the chin strap, the pork chop sideburn.  I'm going to go with the mustache that goes into the sideburn. 
[03:16:00]  Johnny Grunge looks like insane clown posse without makeup on.  Yes, yes.  He really does.  He didn't die of steroid abuse.  No way.  Let me say hi to Jose in New York.  Jose, go ahead.  Hey, Jose.  All right, guys.  Here we go.  Let's go through this list.  First of all, Mike Von Erich died because he shot himself in the pot because he didn't  shoot himself.  He's the other one.  He died from overdosing on fucking sleeping pills and alcohol in a fucking...  But were there steroids in his body? 
[03:16:30]  If you look up Mike Von Erich, he was a skinny little fucking twig.  Right.  No 23-year-old has ever died from steroids.  No.  It can't happen.  I think half my football team in high school was doing steroids.  Yeah, what the fuck?  Look at this, dude.  Right.  Then you go to Chris Candido.  Chris Candido died from complications from surgery on his fucking leg when he broke his  leg in the ring, and then they put him on an airplane with a blood clot.  Ah, steroids.  Yeah, exactly.  Steroids.  They gave him steroids in the plane. 
[03:17:00]  DJ Peterson, you know that one already.  He fucking shot a bunch of steroids and rode on a motorcycle, I guess.  So he went out the most badass way possible.  Yeah, then Owen Hart, he fell from the fucking room.  Yeah, of course.  Apparently he was injecting himself.  So these fucking people, it's just like we were saying, she puts him on a list, and then  has a doctor come on to talk about steroid use and how it kills wrestlers, but none of  them that she was showing.  Most of the names on that list didn't die of steroids.  Steroids, no.  Well, maybe Brady Boone, maybe, maybe Brady Boone. 
[03:17:30]  But it is weird that a lot of wrestlers die young, Sam Roberts.  Wrestling, the industry attracts damaged people.  And the lifestyle they lead is a little, yeah.  Yeah, you're touring like a fucking rock band and you're getting slammed with a chair  every night.  So you might drive a motorcycle a little recklessly.  Like, are comedy clubs encouraging comics to be alcoholics, or is it a bunch of alcoholics  that are like, yeah?  Yeah, exactly.  I mean, I don't know, but it was pretty fun when it was last. 
[03:18:00]  I was saying, oh, hi, Dan.  There's another one on the list.  Gary Albright?  Yeah.  He was fucking fat as fuck.  He was 375 pounds.  Wow.  That guy who died of a heart attack in the ring.  He died of being fat.  Wait, how?  Oh, my gosh, dude.  Oh, yeah, he's a big guy.  Wait, was that Typhoon?  No.  Oh.  He's got a nice mullet he's sporting there.  He looks like Rocco.  I was just about to say that.  Dude!  Hit me with that chair, dude!  Yeah, get some chicks with some T-backs showing up. 
[03:18:30]  Here we go, Brad.  But Bert and Ernie's hanging out.  Cody Rhodes, Dusty Rhodes' son made a good point.  About Nancy Grace, apparently back in the 80s, he put a tweet out about this.  She dated a pro wrestler in the 80s.  Really?  A tweet out in the 80s?  Oh.  Yeah, well, she lived in Georgia in the 80s during, you know, the big N.W.A. boom.  She probably fucking fucked around with, like, Dusty Rhodes or someone like that.  Oh, no, we don't know for sure.  Dusty Rhodes!  They got rid of her.  Dusty Rhodes.  She got a heart on for wrestling because they hate her because she looks like a fucking clown. 
[03:19:00]  She does.  She looks like a jobber.  Yeah, there you go.  Picking up the lingo, homie.  Thank you.  Jobber.  All right, Jose.  Thank you, buddy.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  Let's get back to that Nancy Grace thing.  It's taking us forever to get through this, but there's some comedy in here.  Cody Rhodes called Nancy Grace an ignorant sweat hog.  Sweat hog.  All right, go ahead.  Anabolic steroids are probably used by 1% of Americans, and it's really bad on the cardiovascular 
[03:19:30]  system, meaning your heart, your arteries.  It ruins your cholesterol, raises your blood pressure.  It can cause a lot of heart enlargement that can lead, actually, to an arrhythmia causing sudden death.  Oh, man.  Can you imagine if the ultimate warrior got taken out by cholesterol?  That would be crazy.  Yeah.  I don't like this guy's doctor energy.  Let me tell you something, cholesterol.  After all the years of just eating whatever I wanted, cholesterol, you're here.  This guy's doctor energy is upsetting me, too. 
[03:20:00]  If he was my doctor, I wouldn't go back to him.  No, I don't like it.  Because he's like that fun, like, science is fun energy.  Yeah.  You can learn about science.  Science is everywhere.  Shut up, doctor.  Don't you have fun?  Put a little dye in the water.  See how it changes?  Science.  Shut up.  Science is in a flower.  Science is in the trees.  All around you.  Science.  I love it.  I could picture that show. 
[03:20:30]  And it stinks.  And then they're like, can you talk about steroids?  He's like, steroids make people die.  Only one percent.  Oh, fuck this guy.  That's what makes wrestling amazing.  Is a bunch of jacked up dudes all rotted out on coke.  That's what you wanted to see.  I don't want to see rational dudes in decent bodies just fake fighting.  What are they doing?  Continue.  Alexis Rezchuk, senior reporter, RadarOnline.com. 
[03:21:00]  What happened?  His wife and his wife were in Phoenix.  They were actually just walking to the car in front of their hotel, and he collapsed on the ground.  What the authorities are saying is this was a catastrophic medical event that happened to him.  He was rushed to the hospital, and he was pronounced dead when he was there.  When you say a catastrophic, catastrophic.  Easy for you to say.  I don't know what that word means.  It ain't a sorcerer word.  Are you conjuring the devil? 
[03:21:30]  I'll use it in a sentence.  Your ratings are catastrophic.  Now you understand.  That shit makes it does sound like when his heart blew up, like blood came out, like when Papa Shango did that to him.  Oh, man.  Just so cute.  He's like, oh, something catastrophic's happening in this parking lot.  We do need to look into voodoo curses.  Voodoo curses.  It could be.  The thing is, wife is like, well, you cut it out.  You're not in the ring right now.  She's like, there's no fans around.  I let you change your name. 
[03:22:00]  I told you not to do the gimmick.  Oh, warrior.  Horrible, though.  Horrible.  I don't know what you mean by that.  What do you mean, Alexis?  Those are the exact words the authorities use.  His heart blew out.  That's what I believe.  That's what people are saying.  It sounds like a heart attack.  What the causes of the heart attack have not been determined yet.  There are going to be toxicology reports.  There's going to be an autopsy done.  Look at his red face.  He is only 54.  He was only 54. 
[03:22:30]  Very young.  But he even admitted in the past he had done steroids.  Relax, it is.  And he just signed up to be an ambassador for WWE to come back again.  It was a huge comeback for him.  An ambassador to the WWE.  It was a horrible tragedy.  That video of Ultimate Warrior from WWE here on the set with me.  Diamond Dallas Page.  He's horrible.  Diamond Dallas Page.  Did anybody question, number one, who's that man in face paint?  And number two, where could that footage have come from? 
[03:23:00]  He's shaking a blue cage.  These two men seem to be fighting.  I want to know, who is that guy?  They don't appear to actually be hitting each other.  Holy shit.  Her delivery is horrible.  Horrible.  And then the person she brings on has nothing to add.  She's the worst.  What do you mean by catastrophic?  That she doesn't have anything.  Say he died.  That's the whole reason we're talking about this.  So you're saying he's dead.  And this isn't a wrestling death.  This is a real life death. 
[03:23:30]  What does catastrophic mean?  Oh, God.  You have to ask that question?  I think we know what that means.  Fucking zoo animal.  She is stupid.  She's an ignorant sweat hog.  She really is the worst.  This is so much fun to make fun of.  I just like the way that Anthony said that matter-of-factly, because you're fucking right.  She's stupid.  She's just stupid.  Just stupid.  Continue.  Pro-wrestler question.  When you first heard that he was dead, what did you think? 
[03:24:00]  Hooray.  What do you think?  Wow.  Yeah.  Socks.  That's what happened.  That's socks.  I thought, holy shit.  I thought, prove it.  He's going to go steroids.  Yeah.  Well, that's what she wants him to say.  That's what he's on.  He'll say, somebody didn't do their DDP yoga available now.  You're going plugged.  I see where you're going.  No, he'll be good, because Ultimate Warrior went out of the Hall of Fame and out of nowhere 
[03:24:30]  plugged DDP yoga.  Good man.  During his speech.  I remember that.  He said something about saving the men from their sins or something.  Right.  So DDP, he's on Warrior's cycle.  He was talking about his mama's bladder at the time.  Pity the fool.  You know, I just saw him.  I just saw him at the Hall of Fame, and he looked great, but you don't always know what's  going on inside.  You look great.  Inside, you know, his energy was as high as I've ever. 
[03:25:00]  He was a very intense cat.  You know, he lived life.  I mean, if you're going online, look at his workouts.  He'd still work out like he was 20 years old.  I mean, he would hit really, really hard.  That was the whole Ultimate Warrior spot.  Well, that would make you think that he was in great shape, so why would he be found there?  Yeah, but, you know, sometimes, you know, I don't know.  The last thing I am is a doctor, Nancy.  But I am a doctor.  Come back to me.  Oh!  Do you want to learn about science?  Oh, welcome back! 
[03:25:30]  I like that Diamond Dallas Page sounds like an old black musician.  Where he's like, I haven't been on the road for about 40 years.  I thought school you were.  Wow.  Where does she get these people from?  Yeah.  Nothingtoadd.com.  She likes, you know what it is?  She's like one of those people that pays for friends to be dumb so she can be the smartest person in the room.  But you got the science doctor.  You got that bra that doesn't know what catastrophic means. 
[03:26:00]  And then you got the wrestler that has nothing else to add.  Well, she's trying to get Diamond Dallas Page to say that it's steroids.  Right.  And he's not going to say that.  Can you back up just slightly?  Because we were laughing hard out there.  Well, Nancy, piece of vinegar and baking soda volcano.  It simulates how a real volcano explodes.  But now, how does this, what does this have to do with the wrestler?  It's like his heart was a volcano.  It blew up catastrophically. 
[03:26:30]  Oh, shit.  The last thing I am is a doctor.  Now, I know nobody's ever accused you of being a medical doctor.  But what I'm saying is, tonight, claims of drug use and steroids swirling.  He's admitted that he used steroids.  Yeah, back in the day, a lot of people, we all used them back in the day.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  I fucking want to punch her in the goddamn head.  No kidding.  He said we.  He didn't mean you in there.  Yeah, like not the entire human race.  I might have sucked off a tag team in my day. 
[03:27:00]  I might have been putting the devil's gruesome.  But I didn't do drugs.  Dumped to you by the road warriors.  I might have been DP'd by the Rockers in 87 when they were working Vern Gagne's AWA.  But I certainly didn't do drugs.  Fuck Nancy Grace.  Oh, she's an asshole.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Dredge.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Oh, she was just like rubbing her pussy on the outside of her pants.  Please don't ever say that again. 
[03:27:30]  Sorry.  Thank you.  And I demonstrated.  You did.  Usually that's hot.  Ew.  Ew.  But she didn't even let DDP get out the point.  He's like, who's saying it's drug related?  Yeah.  Well, just you just said that.  What are you talking about?  Well, that's what they love doing that.  People are saying.  Yeah.  Speculating.  What people?  Well, people are saying that Nancy Grace sucks.  People are saying the word is.  Why don't you be brave enough to go, I think it was steroids.  I need writings.  Right.  Right.  Steroids.  That's pretty much what it is. 
[03:28:00]  All right.  Let's hear it.  All right.  Come back in the day, baby.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Well, I know we didn't.  Oh, I've never used steroids.  I always know a steroid if it bit me in the neck.  You know what, though?  He's talking about the wrestlers.  Time out real quick, though.  That was kind of.  If she meant to do that, that was fucking hilarious.  That was a good joke.  If she goes, I didn't use steroids.  If she said that, like, in a Carson way, like Johnny Carson, I would have been like,  oh, that was a good joke.  Yeah.  Good for Nancy.  But no, she was just being an asshole.  Yeah.  Because she's out of touch.  We all use steroids.  He wasn't talking about everybody in that form. 
[03:28:30]  He means we all in wrestling.  In wrestling.  She thinks that her audience is going to sit at home going, she's right.  I didn't use steroids either.  Nancy, I don't remember her having a Linda Hamilton body from Terminator 2.  I never used a steroid name.  She's absolutely right.  It's an old man with dead cats.  Watch it with a fucking aerial with tinfoil on it.  It's all staticky.  What on earth is this Rassler talking about?  I don't fucking goddamn shit.  You're Southern Neuter? 
[03:29:00]  Yeah.  It sounds a bit like the other N-word.  Goddamn.  I didn't do that Neuter.  I mean, you've got to watch it come out of the mouth to know it ain't.  That's right.  It's a little close, is all I'm saying.  Your Neuter is a little close.  That Southern Neuter.  It's all steroid if it's bit me in the neck.  Well, I mean, we did it all.  I mean, certain guys wanted a certain edge.  And I tell you, I tried it back when I was a kid, too.  And it's something that once that's in your body, I guess, you know, you're going to have some, you're going to have some, you know, what's it called? 
[03:29:30]  Residual.  Residual.  Residual.  Residual.  Without question.  But, you know, he was, and he actually changed his name to Warrior.  Nice.  He was a passionate individual towards working out big time.  You know, and that's, you know.  Yeah, look at his fucking ass.  That's a 12-pack.  Maybe he was like 230 or something.  That's it.  That kind of ended, yeah.  She's a dope.  She's an idiot.  Really is just a dope.  You're trying to tell me Arnold Schwarzenegger could get that big, and he didn't cheat? 
[03:30:00]  You're like, it's documented he was on steroids.  And he's fine.  Yeah, you know.  But if he died, God knows where Nancy Grace would take him.  Isn't the machines coming from the future?  I've never seen a machine from the future.  Arnold is a Terminator.  Machines, very important part of science.  Science, Zipri.  Fucking Asian science doctor. 
[03:30:30]  I would watch that show.  It sounds pathetic, but I'd have to watch.  A lot of experiments.  A lot of the cheesy elementary school ones.  Yeah, it'd be one setting in like a faux kitchen.  Can we make a battery out of a lime, copper, and zinc?  Oh, you're learning science.  We exhumed this dead man to learn the science.  But it's a kid show about dead people?  It's a fucking...  Fuck.  I can't believe just how mad it makes me that she's like... 
[03:31:00]  She should be thrown off the air, but not because of protests.  Because of content.  Nobody should be watching her.  Right.  Right.  She's not a very good journalist.  Terrible.  And her experts are horrible.  They don't have anything in their name.  Hashtag steroid warrior.  She was an attorney.  She got jammed up with something.  Something happened like when she was an attorney.  Some kind of misappropriation.  And then she had that fiance that got shot, I guess? 
[03:31:30]  Jesus.  Yeah.  During a robbery, wasn't it?  Yeah, she's got some kind of tragic story.  And what'd she do?  Run away?  I don't know.  How'd she get away?  What happened?  Steroids.  I was there.  Steroids.  She wouldn't know if one bit her in the neck.  She would never bite.  She doesn't know.  She's not familiar.  I know the story.  What is the story?  She was too ugly for the bullet.  Did the bullet actually do that thing where it goes?  It was a cartoon bullet.  Made 90 turns around her head.  Where it hit the brakes and did a skin stop. 
[03:32:00]  And then there was also something she did a few months back when weed was being legalized  in Colorado.  She was talking about pot and how horrible this law is that people are going to be smoking  pot and get all fucked up and screw up at work.  And it affects...  She's talking about how it affects everything.  Every bit of your senses and physical strength and what you do and what you think.  And then, during the Trayvon Martin thing, when weed came up and the fact that he smoked  weed and it might have done something to alter his demeanor when he was out there, it's 
[03:32:30]  like, everyone knows one marijuana cigarette's not going to do anything to...  So, she was saying the completely opposite thing, depending on what her agenda is.  Yes.  You're trying to tell me she's not legitimate?  I am saying to you...  Let me put to you...  She's my moral compass.  Wow.  It's spinning around like the Bermuda Triangle.  Like I'm lost in the triangle.  You're lost.  You know, the numbers are down in Colorado. 
[03:33:00]  They were expecting more people to be smoking the dope.  The weed?  Down like 13%.  From where they were expecting the tax dollars to be.  Uh-oh.  Well, they're still going to make a shit ton of money.  Sure.  I bet people are still getting it from their dealers.  Like, who cares?  It's like, I don't care.  What?  My buddy actually comes to my house and delivers it.  I can't wait to see...  I don't have to go out.  I can't wait to see that angle taken where they're like, it's putting people out of jobs.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They're drug dealers. 
[03:33:30]  It's costing Americans jobs.  We need to re-employ these drug dealers.  Oh, okay.  All right.  I got you.  Let's say hi to Rodney in El Paso.  We rarely take a phone call from El Paso, so...  Let's go, Rodney.  Down in the west Texas town of El Paso, I fell in love with a Mexican girl.  You know that song?  That's all there is.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Morning, gentlemen.  Morning.  Yeah, a while ago, when you said, you're a southern nigger, I was like, who are we doing a nigger accent?  It was more... 
[03:34:00]  I caught it when nobody was doing it.  I said nether.  And Anthony was doing it.  Yeah, I was saying neither.  Yeah.  And southern neither.  And southern neither.  Wow.  It's very close to the word.  Dropping the bombs.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Maybe we should have taken that call.  You guys are like, I got all excited.  You never know.  I finally was like, you guys are using it.  You're like me, man.  We're the same, me and you. 
[03:34:30]  That guy was great.  We're going to take a break.  We got to talk about Hillary Clinton.  The little shoe was thrown at her.  Good for stomping queens.  Fucking guy.  And the Rio de Janeiro clip I hear is good.  I did not see that one.  And we got Dan Soder just killing it for us today, man.  Holy fuck.  It's going to be on Conan Tuesday?  Yeah.  In the guy code thing, season four premieres April 16th.  So that's next Wednesday, I guess, right?  Yeah.  And I'm going to be, I'm actually, I think the sketch I'm on on Schumer's show is on Tuesday.  Oh. 
[03:35:00]  Inside Amy.  Wow.  Amy's great.  Yeah.  She's the fucking best.  Yeah.  Very cool.  She sure is.  She sends me the meanest text messages sometimes, and I love them.  They really make my fucking day sometimes.  Yeah.  She puts everyone to work.  I'll tell you that much.  She really does.  She puts everyone to task.  Yes.  And we got a former gym teacher claiming she was fired for refusing to have a...  Sex change!  Um, heterosexual thought?  See, because they usually...  You'll find out next!

Hey, this is Dr. Steve from Weird Medicine with another Dr. Steve Medical Minute.  Hey, Dr. Steve.  I was watching that show, The Walking Dead, and I was wondering if you thought that could really happen.  Keeps me up at night. 
[03:40:30]  Thank you.  Well, there are very few icons of modern fiction that are creepier than zombies.  Mindless, shuffling former humans that have a hunger for flesh,  and on top of that are unrelenting.  Some movies have slow zombies, some have fast zombies,  and others, like AMC's Walking Dead, kind of have a mixture.  The good news is, most zombie movies are horse shit in the practical sense.  Any virus or toxin that caused the dead to reanimate would have to get energy from somewhere to keep the body moving. 
[03:41:00]  Muscles use chemical energy, and this requires a pretty constant input.  Viruses are net consumers of energy.  A virus by itself cannot generate energy.  So, if you wake up tomorrow in the middle of a zombie apocalypse,  hold yourself up for a while until they all run out of brains to eat,  and they'll just fall down eventually.  This is why I think 28 Days Later series was the most realistic of all the recent zombie movies, 
[03:41:30]  and why the book World War Z wins the unrealistic award for its horde of immortal undersea undead walkers.  Barring a virus or a toxin, the only other explanation that bears scrutiny is something supernatural.  And you don't believe in magic anymore, do you?

Hey, Jenna, you there?  Hi, how are you?  I'm doing fine, and Bobo Man's getting hard hearing the sound of your voice, Jenna.  Sexy.  I'm just thinking about you, just thinking about pounding you right... 
[03:42:30]  It's pounding you, pounding you in the ass.  Yeah, it's very tell-hitting.  Hey, what are you looking for, Jenna, huh?  Nowadays, I'm so single and so in need of a man.  Hey, well, if you're looking for a man, then you're talking to the right person.  I just like to have sex.  Oh, well, you want sex?  Him, you'll get it, baby.  I got my hand on the boat boner. 
[03:43:00]  It's there just waiting for you.  It should be huge.  Oh, it is.  Three and a half inches there just waiting for you.  Oh, yummy.  You want me to make you happy, Jenna?  You happy?  I'm bummed.  I'm super bummed.  Ooh, I like that.  What has you down?  Um, I have, uh...  Uh...  Bad acts.  Tell me more. 
[03:43:30]  Oh, yeah.  I have a lot of things going on, but, you know, my main priority are my kids.  What else is wrong?  I just want to, um, make sure that I am with my kids.  Oh, God, I want to be inside you, Jenna.  That's the thing, is I feel like, um, I know I'll get on Twitter, because I'll get mad, and  I'll be like, rah, and go crazy on Twitter, and people will think I'm nuts. 
[03:44:00]  But, in reality, it's really just me trying to tell people what is really happening.  Oh, man, here comes the pre.  And I haven't seen my kids for a very, very long time.  I'm able to see them only two days a week, and, um, they charge me $400 an hour. 
[03:44:30]  Oh, my God.  That was good.  Thanks, Jenna.  No doubt.  Come here, Mr. Maloon again.  Daddy has something that needs cleaning.  Say what?  The Opie and Anthony Show is back.  On Sirius XM.  The Nancy Grace bashing didn't stop our mics.  When the mics went off, we just kept going.  Because it's so fucking easy. 
[03:45:00]  It really is.  She's a despicable person.  Oh, my God.  I don't want facts.  Right.  I want sensationalized things.  Suck my pussy.  I'm Nancy Grace.  We think she missed at least ten guys that actually died, possibly, of steroid abuse.  Sam and I just named fucking seven without even blinking.  Chris Benoit should have been on that list, right?  Yes.  British Bulldog.  British Bulldog, possibly.  No, he was definitely steroids. 
[03:45:30]  If you saw that dude.  She blew off all those guys because they were too old.  But a lot of those guys were only in their 40s, early 50s.  Uh-huh.  That's when a warrior was 54.  Or, but that's, if you wanted a legitimate steroid argument, you'd bring up wrestlers who were in their 40s.  40s and 50s, right.  Steroids don't kill young people.  No, that's when you're the big guy with the, that's when you look up like an amazing, healthy workout guy.  That's when your body can handle it.  That's when you're getting all the puss.  It filters that shit through a little bit.  You've got everything pumping nice and nice and hard still. 
[03:46:00]  Yeah, you can't be dying.  You've got too much trim to wade through.  Yeah.  Way too much bush coming in to die.  That's right.  Nice.  Nice, right?  There's too much slit in front of you.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I would be, but I'm shoulder pressing my way out of all this trim.  Yeah.  Too busy lifting all the plates at the gym.  Yeah.  Oh, I'm sorry.  You don't have time to die yet.  That was just the sound of 400 pounds clacking on the rack. 
[03:46:30]  How about that?  I'll do a few more of those and then, you know.  You've got a tank top with a skinnier nothing?  Does it dip lower?  Can my tank top dip to my balls?  Gives a fuck, my balls are tiny.  I want to look like a shirt is mounting on me.  I want to look like I have a hard time getting in and out of cars.  Yeah, look at this.  It does look very inconvenient to be that big, like the bodybuilder big. 
[03:47:00]  Well, I love that this is like an old 80s one where it shows him as an awesome football player.  Yeah.  Well, that's not going to necessarily mean.  That wouldn't happen.  Yeah.  That's not going to happen.  You're white.  Yeah, first of all, you're white.  You're not going to be a good football player.  Your body is freakish for any sport.  Whoa, whoa, with that stereotype, okay?  Because white guys have done okay in the NFL.  You're right.  Blocking and kicking.  That's true.  And throwing the ball. 
[03:47:30]  Look at all.  I love the pants that people on steroids wear.  It's like fanny pack.  They always have fanny packs and it's something loose fitting.  Why do you want to look like that?  Roland dresses like he's on steroids.  I never had the desire to be that big when I was a gym rat.  Were you a gym rat?  Well, I worked out a lot, but I never wanted to be like that.  You've got to wear the fanny pack because you can't fit the shit in your pockets, right?  Because you're all bulging.  Well, you need all your supplements.  Right.  Oh, you've got to keep your supplements in there, too. 
[03:48:00]  Look at Rick Martell.  This is before and after 1991 is Rick Martell.  92 is when the steroid trial started.  Oh, look.  What happened?  Yeah, look at Hogan.  Hogan, it's crazy.  You look at Hogan in like 89, 90.  Right.  You look at Hogan 92, 93.  It's like, it really, I'm not joking when I say this.  It reminds me of when my dad got cirrhosis and he dropped to like an unhealthy weight  where you're like, you're dying.  Wow, yeah.  So you look at Hogan then, but like that, that one where he's flexing his arms. 
[03:48:30]  Yeah, that's tiny.  See how skinny he is?  Yeah, that's tiny for Hogan.  Yeah.  That looks weird.  Oh, yeah, look at his arms.  He's still in really good shape, but that's tiny for him.  But then you look at him from like 88 and he's just this fucking massive.  There you go.  Look at that.  Yeah, look at his arms.  The difference in arm size is crazy.  Fuck, we should all be on steroids, man.  What do we do?  Should we do a cycle together?  Let's do it.  Let's cycle in.  Science?  Yes, it's just science.  Anyway. 
[03:49:00]  It's amazing.  I want to see this man in Rio de Janeiro there, Sam Roberts.  Rio de Janeiro.  Wasn't that another Desi Arnaz's Ricky Ricardo song?  A man tries to steal a woman's necklace while she gives a TV interview about what?  About safety or something?  That's what it says it is.  Yeah.  You can't understand it because it's a...  Oh, it's a Portuguese?  Oh, it's Espana or Portuguese.  What do they speak?  Portuguese.  Portuguese. 
[03:49:30]  Also known as the language of kidnapping.  I bet if I said Portuguese in Southern, it would sound bad, too.  Wow.  Wow.  That's enough said about that subject.  So, Brazilian woman mugged during live TV interview.  Right.  What's that they're talking about? 
[03:50:00]  Does she have to stay right next to buses?  Give me that shit.  Give me that shit.  Somebody went for a chain?  How do you even see that chain?  I didn't see it.  That was a tiny chain, but the kid got it and ran away on live TV.  Oh, no.  He dropped it.  I dropped it?  That chain is tiny.  Oh, the police.  I bet they're not corrupt.  The police.  They arrested her.  Why are they doing this interview right next to fucking buses? 
[03:50:30]  I don't know.  That's like a half a foot away.  It's like...  Yeah.  I'm like, yeah, you should have got your necklace stolen.  You're standing next to a fucking moving bus.  But you can't even see the necklace.  It's that tiny.  How much could the guy get for that?  It's over there.  It's probably a house.  You could get a house for it.  Good point.  I always love that white people thinking, like, third world money.  You're like, I don't know.  What could that buy him there?  I don't know.  There, I'm sure.  Probably a compound.  Oh, he fucking lives like a king.  You give him a quarter, they live like a king. 
[03:51:00]  He'll be eating papaya for weeks.  Yeah, don't worry about him.  All right.  Well, that happened.  That's good.  Have you seen that Summer is Here video with that family?  I've been avoiding that one.  I know a lot of people are tweeting it.  I was avoiding it.  And you finally hit it?  It is so bad.  I thought it was a goof at first.  Right.  But no, it's serious.  You know how that black guy put out those videos?  Chocolate room?  Friday.  No, chocolate room.  Friday.  Yeah, he put out, like, it's Friday. 
[03:51:30]  Friday.  Friday.  And then he put out the other one with the other chick.  Thanksgiving.  Thanksgiving.  Right.  And a few other ones with these kids.  I think they were kind of going for something like that.  But nobody has any talent.  The song they wrote is so bad.  I don't even know.  And the video is so poorly done.  Which one is it?  And the kids are so ugly.  That's what I like in my videos.  Yes.  Hot kids.  Which one is it?  Summer is Great. 
[03:52:00]  I think it's Summer is Great or something.  Summer is Great.  Summer is Great.  Let's see.  There they are.  All right.  Official music video.  Oh, it's magnificent.  Summertime is Great on YouTube.  Let's go full screen with this.  You got it.  So you can get the entire gist.  This song is...  It's an immersive experience.  I imagine you watching it in your home theater.  Yeah, I should have.  Oh, man.  Summer is Great.  Hey, everybody.  It's summertime.  Oh, this isn't a ghost.  Science is fine. 
[03:52:30]  Summer vacation is here.  Oh, no.  Gonna ride my bike.  Gonna go somewhere.  It's my favorite time of year.  I thought it was at first, but it's not.  Oh, pause.  Talk about poor body image.  She looks like the son of a professional...  She looks like the daughter of a wrestler.  Oh, man.  Why would she...  Slaughter's kid.  Why would she do this? 
[03:53:00]  All these kids...  You know how much evil is out there?  Why are you doing this?  You know what?  So far, both kids look like children that got abducted and murdered.  First of all, the boy riding the bike at the beginning comes off a little effeminate.  A bit fruity.  And with the internet...  You're saying top button on a golf shirt?  A little bit.  He reminded me of, like, a young version of the killer from True Detective. 
[03:53:30]  I guess.  He could use a cycle.  Yeah.  Blast those delts.  Now, the girl has so much wrong with her.  She's like a chubbier version of the girl from Shameless.  Yes!  Right?  Yes, yes.  Much chubbier.  But...  Even chubbier.  She's a chubby girl.  Who was the fat guy in Pee-wee's Big Adventure?  Oh, my God!  Francis!  She looks like Francis.  Hi, Pee-wee.  Pee-wee.  Nice bike Pee-wee. 
[03:54:00]  That's what she looks like.  She looks like fucking Francis.  You deal with Katy Perry, man.  She's going to be pissed.  Wow.  She wrote a whole song about this shit.  Bullying.  Francis?  Firecracker, right?  About Francis?  You're right.  Firecracker had the chubby girl jumping in the pool because it's cool.  It doesn't matter what you look like.  Well, let me tell you something.  Yeah, but if you want to make good radio, you make fun of that fat ass.  But the thing is, it's not...  Look, I'm not taking blame on this.  They know that YouTube has a fucking comments section.  She's going to get slaughtered. 
[03:54:30]  Yeah, you put your daughter out to die.  It's crazy.  Put her in a video like that, and Katy Perry is one of the hottest chicks ever, so yeah,  if she writes a feel-good fucking song...  Yeah, she probably shouldn't be singing those songs.  Yeah, you let an ugly person...  Yeah, Lord.  Yeah!  Lord should be singing Firecracker, Lord.  Exactly.  You're right, Katy Perry.  Not a hint of fat on her.  With a wonderful tits.  Except in the titty.  But she's going to tell fatties it's okay.  Be beautiful.  Oh, okay, chick who everyone wants to see, topless.  I don't want to see Francis from Pee-wee circling a pool like some sort of land shark. 
[03:55:00]  You'll get yours, Pee-wee.  She looks like him.  My dad said, I can have anything I want.  Spearmint or fruit?  Boy, that movie's still fucking funny, by the way.  Oh, absolutely.  Holds up.  Let's see what else is going on in this movie.  All right.  Look into the camera. 
[03:55:30]  She looks like a wire.  See all the birds in the sky.  Time to hit the...  Oh!  The hotel pool, by the way.  All the water almost splashed out of it.  Oh, if that isn't a fucking motel off a highway.  Yeah, that looks like a housing development pool.  Yeah, it's a community pool.  It's like the community pool.  They're like, could we use the community pool this weekend?  That's a place that sells pool.  Come on down to Jim Spawn Pool.  It's stuck in the place.  In the winter, they sell pool tables. 
[03:56:00]  And then in the summer, they sell pools.  They're showing you an installation that they can do.  Right now, a single mom's furious that she's got to take her kid back to her apartment.  All right, you can use the pool from 6 to 6.05, but no later.  How many takes do you need?  We got an all-swim at 6.15.  We got an all-swim.  Old people aerobics is happening.  Tell Chubby not to knock too much water out of the pool.  She jumps in the pool to crawl up.  I like the building managers.  Like, wait, you're putting your daughter in the video?  Yeah.  As soon as you're going to put that on YouTube, are you? 
[03:56:30]  No, no, no.  As soon as you hit the water, God damn it, go get the hose.  I've got to fill this thing up again.  I saw the shot of your girl jumping in the pool.  You're going to disable comments, right?  Hey, man, listen.  As a man who watches a lot of YouTube, let me lead this conversation by saying disable the comments.  You're going to set this for friends?  Private.  Private?  Set it for private.  This is a Christmas card you're sending out.  This is a video Christmas card. 
[03:57:00]  Even her own family would beat the shit out of her.  I know.  All right, let's go.  She's in the pool now, frolicking.  Nice.  And it's my favorite time of year.  It's summertime.  It isn't it good.  It's summertime.  Who's the old dude?  That's, I think, the dad.  It's the dad that's being forced in to do this by his wife.  Oh, that might be his two kids.  They all look similar.  It is.  That's the father and the two kids are making their video.  What a very ugly family. 
[03:57:30]  That's what I said.  Yeah.  It's a real fucking who cares family face.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's summertime and everything's great.  It's summertime and it's great.  Like, the words are so poorly written.  But the video's blown up.  It is blown up.  Not for the reasons he was told.  Humans are innately evil.  Yeah.  Horrible.  You want to see the disaster.  Yeah.  Nothing's great, by the way.  No.  Cause I'm free.  Oh, man.  What the hell is this?  Who is this? 
[03:58:00]  He looks like one of the creators of IBM.  Like he had a startup in his garage.  Here's this guy with a horrid comb over.  Oh, my God.  Sitting on a cheesy motorbike.  With obvious bad breath.  Yes, it does look like he has a bad breath.  We're not there.  Playing an acoustic guitar on the side of a road by, like, a field.  On a shitty, almost motorcycle.  It's a little motorbike.  If I had a child playing sports and this guy was anywhere near him, I'd be like, I'm 
[03:58:30]  pulling him from the game.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm not letting this son play.  Yeah.  This guy has the hassle of having to tell all of his neighbors when he moves into town.  Yeah.  Fucking old clammy hands that's moving in next door.  He's not allowed to celebrate Halloween.  Is this the father?  I think it's the father.  You know, if I shave my mustache, people won't be able to tell.  Yeah.  You can tell he has really bad dandruff.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Just smell that comb over and everything.  Just unhealthy scalp.  The beatings that you would take in school, based on that being your father, is so much 
[03:59:00]  worse than anything else you're actually doing in the video.  Right.  Let's go, though.  Come on, guys.  Here we go.  Well, if they didn't stop throwing so much ugly at us.  Yeah, I know.  They really are.  We could mow through this thing.  It's funny you ask.  I played in a band in college.  Yeah.  You know, we should make a video, kids.  Oh, my God.  That'd be fun.  Yeah.  His kids have no concept what cool is. 
[03:59:30]  No, I'll bring the motorcycle out.  What do we write a song about?  Well, just write a song about something you enjoy.  What's something you like?  Summertime, Dad.  We'll write a song about summertime.  Okay.  Now put your clothes back on.  We're going to show Alicia swimming.  Oh, yeah.  Get her in that swimsuit.  We need to sexy up this video.  His wife is yelling at him.  I thought they took the video camera away from you.  We have to move again.  Hit it. 
[04:00:00]  Oh.  The kids by the fake lake on the housing development.  Now she's running in circles with her brother holding some red rag.  A cymbal splash.  Now they're on the beach in white sneakers.  Looks like Bobo.  The sun.  They should have Bobo do a summertime video.  He's got long sleeves.  Whoa.  I'm not grilling on that.  Oh, his pants are too high.  Oh.  Wow.  Wow.  Oh, God. 
[04:00:30]  It looks like he's cooking up people he abducted.  He's wearing Dockers or slacks.  What has he got on?  A little bit too high.  But they're a little too big, too.  Yeah, they're too big.  That's so that extra room, so no one sees that he's got a boner at the school.  Or he goes, I had the stomach surgery two years ago.  And we haven't been able to afford to get my extra skin taken off.  So I have to wear bigger pants.  If you want to joke about that.  I have to wear flowing shirts.  Because my squirrel skin. 
[04:01:00]  He, in 2014, is blousing his shirt.  Yeah, oh.  All right with the blousing.  The ulcer was way ahead of his time.  He bought that shirt because it was on sale at TJ Maxx, even though it wasn't his size.  Check out the ugly kids, man.  You know who dresses like that outside of work?  Yeah.  Dennis Falcone.  Oh, Dennis Falcone.  This is like something Denny would do.  Yeah.  Hey, just having fun?  Yeah.  Making a little video with his kids?  I think it's healthy.  I've been a songwriter myself for quite some time. 
[04:01:30]  I fancy myself.  Now, are these children missing?  And do I have a case here?  It should be.  Why is he panning up into the tree?  It's an artistic shot.  Oh, all right.  He's doing a little artistic.  He's going to bring it home with something.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Well, here we go.  I wish the tree would fall down.  It's my favorite time of year.  Barbecuing.  It's time of year.  Oh, boy.  Can she even fit on that slide?  Her shirt says swag. 
[04:02:00]  Swag.  She has a swag shirt on.  Is that a pig?  Yeah.  I think it is.  I think it is.  It's a hippo.  Even worse.  I bet the back of the shirt says YOLO.  You know what?  This really...  I'm starting to notice this.  We've seen the kids.  We've seen the husband.  Yeah.  This really does have dead mom written all over it.  Oh, wow.  Where the daughter...  Guys, it's been a year since mom passed.  Yeah.  Let's make a video that's fun to take our time.  About summertime. 
[04:02:30]  Remember how much mom...  You know her favorite time of year?  Remember when she got sick?  And it was...  All right.  That's all right.  I'm sorry.  She's on the top of a slide.  You reminded me so much of your mom when I met her.  Get on the slide.  Just creepy mother-father-dead...  Daughter-father-dead-mother scenario.  She's wearing mommy's bathing suit.  Oh, the one-piece.  We've got to use it.  Mom is still very much alive.  She hightailed it out of there a long time ago.  I bet she ditched. 
[04:03:00]  With no explanation.  She pulled a Travis Tefft mother out there.  Oh, she's getting black dicks somewhere.  Oh!  Shit.  Well, she should have done it to have kids, so their kids had some muscle toes.  She's laughing at her family's video now.  Look at these idiots.  That's why I left.  Let's see if she can squeeze down the slide or not.  You think she's going to attempt it?  No.  She's going to do that thing where she jumps up and lands on her butt on the slide.  Oh, yeah.  And the top of the slide is just going to snap and collapse. 
[04:03:30]  Let's go.  I'd love to see that.  Yeah.  And isn't it great?  Dang.  Oh, God.  The guy thinks his bike is cool.  Isn't this abandoned parking lot?  Yeah.  He lost hair between scenes.  He really did.  Go back.  I think he went more bald.  It must have been a gust of wind.  You know how people would come over and they hate gusts of wind.  What the fuck happened?  Dad, if we want to do the pan shot with you on your Kawasaki, we got it.  The wind's messing up my hair. 
[04:04:00]  He's bald.  He's picking his hair up off the ground and putting it back on his head for the shot.  It's Rogaine time and everything's great.  What is great?  What's great?  These people have nothing great going on in their lives.  It's summertime and everything's great.  It's summertime.  Isn't it great?  Right.  What the fuck?  I got to tell you, though, this is not that bad at all.  It's nowhere near Valkyrie, but it's a good video.  You enjoyed the video.  Valkyrie by Asia. 
[04:04:30]  Supergroup Asia.  Thank you.  Not quite as good as...  You can't just say Asia.  I know.  You know that right now.  First supergroup.  First supergroup.  The world's first.  Right.  All right.  Let's get back.  I hate love.  Going to the beach.  Oh, yeah.  That doesn't match up.  No, you don't.  No, you don't have your swimsuit on.  It's my favorite time of year.  When?  When is your favorite?  It's on.  The mysterious sun is now on some playground equipment.  Holy fucking school shooter. 
[04:05:00]  Yes.  They're dancing on the bridge of a...  As you should call it dancing.  They said he got the AR-15 at a gun show.  After reading the YouTube comments on his summertime video.  He moved down his middle school.  The bridge is going to collapse.  He went through his growth spurt and they wouldn't buy him a new shirt.  No.  Look at his shirt.  Look how small it is.  Look at his wrists. 
[04:05:30]  His whole forearms are exposed.  And the daughter's dressed like a girl that's at a drug rehab.  She's like, the beach reminds me of getting high.  After shooting his sister and father in the face, he made his way to his school where he killed 38 people.  Who they're now calling the summertime gunmen.  He was going through the hall saying, summertime, isn't it great?  Summertime, it's so great. 
[04:06:00]  Summertime.  In between clips.  You're all dead motherfuckers.  I'll teach you about summertime.  His father, apparently a large weapons collector.  It looks like little Eastside Dave.  It's what?  Bring your kid to work day.  Is it?  Is it?  I don't know.  There's a kid.  That's great.  There's a kid, I'm assuming.  I should have brought a bag of negative EPT tests.  Good for me. 
[04:06:30]  Where are we?  We're at the miniature golf course.  Last we left, it was summertime and it was great.  It was great.  And they're on the bridge, a little stone bridge at a miniature golf course.  Him and his sister, his fat sister, and they're clapping, they're clapping and then turning  toward the camera, clapping again, and then they turn away from each other, clap again  with zero rhythm.  And he's wearing a shirt that was purchased for him before puberty.  Yes.  Very small.  However, puberty has taken place.  Okay. 
[04:07:00]  Yeah.  Okay.  Oh, she clapped at the rug.  What the hell is that?  What is that?  A little special effect.  It's all right.  Back.  Now they're on the dock.  Oh, he just spun.  He's spinning.  She's spinning.  He was going to spin there, but he didn't.  Oh, it's a fake alligator.  See the duck swim on the lake.  Who wrote this?  Todd?  Now they're looking through some type of carnival game. 
[04:07:30]  Oh, now they're on the motorcycle game at, like, Game & Buster's.  All right.  Oh, of course.  Of course she's eating ice cream.  Maybe not two scoops, honey.  Yeah.  Oh, now they're on a swing set.  All right.  The seesaw is out of the question.  I've never seen a less accurate use of the term swag.  Yes.  Oh!  A little choreography there, huh?  Sitcom intro. 
[04:08:00]  Now, they actually found...  Hold on.  They actually found another two-wheeled vehicle that was even more uncool than the father's  motorcycle for the son to ride.  This is such...  He's on a piss yellow Vespa.  He's on a piss yellow Vespa.  This is such a commercial for low-income housing.  You could live here, too.  For $32,000.  If your income is lower than $32,000 a year, we've got a lovely apartment complex for you. 
[04:08:30]  Only 40 minutes from Manhattan if you take a plane.  This is...  I just keep hearing the dad directing as they're doing it.  He goes, spin!  Spin on the bridge!  Go ahead, Juan.  They're shitty editors as well.  Because every scene starts with them not moving, and then they move.  And then they move.  They're never in mid-move.  They should be already moving.  It's bothering me.  Ethan, look at your sister.  High-fiver.  Good.  Now go into summertime is great. 
[04:09:00]  Spin, spin, spin!  Spin!  Spinning!  Annabelle, you're not spinning!  God damn it, Annabelle!  How are we going to get your mom back if you can't get this choreography?  She'll find it on YouTube.  Yeah, aww.  And the father now has his hat on, because he's going for a little ride on his almost motorcycle.  Right.  You know, that could cause major problems.  You don't want that wind blowing through your fucking skull-mating hair you got.  He loves the wind blowing over his scalp.  He doesn't want to look like Earn McCracken at the end with it just leaking over it. 
[04:09:30]  It all came down!  I didn't want to lose to a guy with a hook!  You're saying the dad's in a position where he would have to worry about getting a sunburn on the top of his head?  Yes, yes, yes.  So he put the hat on for the big motorcycle ride segment.  This song is making me love winter.  Yes.  Yes.  We're almost done.  It's wintertime and these fat slobs are inside.  I'm hoping this takes off.  Then they've got three more songs in them.  So...  Three more songs.  Three more songs.  What a swag. 
[04:10:00]  She's sitting on a big rock.  She's like a human, a hilo monster.  She really is just an ugly, chubby kid.  In a golf cart.  Oh, there's mom!  Ah, she just drove away.  Is that the community vehicle?  It says three best slot.  Three beat slide.  That's the name of their little group.  Oh.  Terrible.  I bet that's the community car that they take the old people down to the pool in.  Now we know where they filmed it. 
[04:10:30]  One of those older community places.  But this is why Joe Jackson was so great.  Because he beat his kids until they were awesome.  This guy needs to...  That guy's not beating the kids very well.  He needs to kick the shit out of his kids.  How many beers was that, Sam?  658,000.  That's it?  I thought I would have put over the million mark already.  Thank you.  Very...  All right.  You know what, Brian?  And comment number one.  Yeah.  This is so white.  Hold on a minute, though.  Brian?  Hey, Obi.  How are you guys doing?  Hey, buddy. 
[04:11:00]  From Chicago.  What do you got?  I've got to say, this is the kill bit or something.  Because I found out their name of the band is three beats wide.  Right.  Can't find a goddamn thing to identify any members of the band.  Oh.  Even the Independent in the United Kingdom, the newspaper, had an article about it.  It never identifies the name of the family.  So it is...  Yeah.  This...  You know what?  Wow.  Right when you say that, you're like, fuck, man.  This dude's smart.  This is a total Kimmel bit. 
[04:11:30]  You think?  Yeah.  It'll wait a month, and then it'll be like, have you...  Kimmel just...  That's what he's genius about.  He'll have him on the show.  Come on the show.  And then he'll be like, yeah, we just put these together.  But I don't know, man.  Their faces are fucking...  That's a real family.  This is my cousin's fucking...  Right.  ...niece and...  Well, whoever it is, that's an ugly-ass family.  Where's...  Where's...  Where will the big reveal be?  He's in the pool with the Chubb...  It's him filming it, or...  Yeah.  It's...  He's also...  I mean...  They're selling this song on iTunes and on Amazon.  Oh, they are? 
[04:12:00]  It's someone big.  I do...  That's fucking...  I didn't even think of that.  That guy nailed it.  This might be...  There's gonna be a little reveal.  Whoever...  Whoever put them up to this is a heartless person.  Because even after this comes out to be a bit, they're gonna be like, yeah, but those  people are still fucking ugly.  Yeah, that girl is still gonna have body image problems.  Yeah, at least Lou Pearlman put out attractive people.  Right.  Yeah.  But she might be an actress, and she knows she has to go out for the ugly role.  I don't know, man.  That family...  That's like family ugly.  That is.  You can't fake that.  You can't cast that ugly. 
[04:12:30]  Yeah, you know they're all...  Every time you see that ugly fat broad on a TV show, you know she had a...  Summer top!  You know she goes out for the ugly roles.  Yeah.  That's a good point.  It's uncomfortable.  You got a good fucking role.  Someone said she was the B-girl from the online melon video.  R.I.P.  Thank you, Brian.  Good one.  She's still there kicking.  It seems like they're...  Maybe it's another band, and they're just like using...  Dave Grohl's board.  That's right.  Yeah, fuck it.  I'll put it on a suit.  It's a new Foo Fighters song.  It's gonna be great when he does it. 
[04:13:00]  We'll have to wait and see.  Yeah, I don't know.  I just think it's a dumb family that...  Has no clue how to really do things.  Let's...  I...  You know what?  I choose to believe that, too.  I just want to believe their dumb family.  I thought they were gonna have a little fun.  And I...  Just the excited...  When they were talking about this around their fucking lackluster kitchen in their townhome.  Oh, the kitchen with the fucking bad colors, and they're all happy because they got one  of the units that were right near the lake that has the fountain in it.  Yeah, the golf course lake. 
[04:13:30]  That every housing community has.  Oh, boy.  Summertime, and everything's great.  Oh, that's a good...  It's summertime.  We should turn that into a video.  Isn't it great?  Did you write that song, Rebecca?  You know, we could write the rest of a song around that chorus, and then we'll do a video.  Isn't this great?  Oh, man.  Maybe Dad'll help.  Dad's the coolest.  Oh, man.  We'll put him on a motorcycle for some...  What is that?  That's their Twitter page. 
[04:14:00]  And this, the dude, the guy, the son, he does not look like an actor.  No way.  I mean, maybe...  That's fucking real.  Like, the daughter looks like fucking Julia Roberts.  I mean...  I'll be saying going out for the ugly roles.  Yeah.  Shifting me out.  Maybe Kimmel knows this family.  I don't know, man.  Maybe they're in the audience.  I don't know.  How the fuck...  That daughter's face, though...  The daughter's face is Francis.  The son needs hormone therapy immediately if they want to keep him from being something 
[04:14:30]  trapped in something else's body.  But, yeah.  He does look like he's a transgender mid...  Yes.  He needs a strong shot of steroids immediately.  He can go either way.  I want no steroid if you bit me in the neck.  But this boy needs some.  A rabid bat would bite her in the fucking neck.  He really does look like a guy that's either going to be a billionaire.  Yeah.  Or end up...  Or a school serializer.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And the father just... 
[04:15:00]  He's at the crossroads right now.  He's convicted.  He's going to be like Steve Buscemi and Billy Madison just putting lipstick on and taking  phone calls.  And humming.  It's time.  It's time.  And the father will be completely bald by Sunday.  I think he's bald by now.  The father's got that look of somebody in a prison interview that's going, I've made peace  with myself and what I've done.  With the Lord.  Yes, with the Lord.  And Jesus forgives me for just making all those people disappear.  I realize I've hurt a lot of people. 
[04:15:30]  We'd love to meet the kids.  Oh, they're not here right now.  No, no.  Their mother has them.  Yeah, where's the mother?  Yeah, I'd like to find out what this family story is.  I'm telling you, who was driving the golf cart at the end of the video?  His lady friend.  That also lives in the complex.  I thought it was a woman, though.  It was.  Maybe it was the mom's cameo.  Oh, she's just my friend.  You think the mom filmed it?  You know we can never replace mom.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  This reeks of Jimmy Kimmel or dead mom. 
[04:16:00]  Dead mom.  No, I think the mom is alive and they're putting it out because they want the mom to see it.  To see it.  And come back.  And be like, oh my God, my super talented family is putting music out.  You should probably use that strategy.  Maybe your mom will see the video.  She'll come back.  Do you remember when?  She'll know we're living in that apartment near that rest area off the highway.  When we see Travis and his dog come out with the music.  It's wintertime. 
[04:16:30]  The rest of my family's gone.  It's fucking cold.  It's wintertime.  Mommy left us for a Jew.  And everyone's dead.  It's wintertime.  Dude, that daughter.  Poor girl.  Yeah.  Look at the sun.  I mean, he's fucked.  I need more life for the basement.  You think he's cool?  Yeah, he's cool.  He'll be in a band in like 20 years.  Sounds cool.  How many times do you think that kid's gotten his glasses broken?  Oh, a lot.  So many times.  I bet he's watched.  He looks like a young Billy Corrigan. 
[04:17:00]  Yeah.  He's probably watched several It Gets Better videos on YouTube.  Yeah.  It does.  And they put him in a good mood and then he goes back to school and somebody slaps him  in the back of the head and stomps on his glasses again.  Hey, where's your pig sister?  Yeah, definitely.  He's got to deal with the sister who just cries every night.  She has to write shit in her diary, what happened every day at school.  The son's coming home with broken glasses and the dad's saying,  Now, son, you know, if they didn't like you, they wouldn't pay any attention to you at all. 
[04:17:30]  Now, look at your sister.  She calms herself by combing her fake horse's hair in her loom.  She's got a bunch of plastic horses on her.  Dear diary, well, they did it to me again.  She's got a hairband.  She's got a hairband around her wrist that she just keeps snapping.  I just, I thought the video would change things.  Snap, snap, snap.  Bullied family right there.  The father brings them in front of a lot of motivational speakers.  Yeah. 
[04:18:00]  They come through town.  And the dad goes, Oh, don't worry.  I was bullied, too.  And look at me.  I learned the guitar.  I learned the guitar.  I have a motorbike now.  I ride a motorbike.  I'm a pretty hip dad.  I'm a filmmaker.  Look at my cap.  I learned all this editing software in less than a week.  Check out this diamond wipe.  iMovie's my best friend.  God, everyone knows all the idiosyncrasies of iMovie's. 
[04:18:30]  Joe in Boston.  Joe.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, man.  I assume you guys have heard a Picnic of Love album by Anal Cunt.  This guy sounds exactly like that.  Come on.  I really don't know much of AC's work.  We were at the Worcester Centrum when AC was just horrifying everyone upstairs as we were  doing interviews with, do you remember which one?  No, it wasn't Bush.  That don't matter. 
[04:19:00]  I don't remember.  That was my first experience with AC.  Yes.  They did one album where it was nothing but love songs.  And there's the guy singing, just like, I brought you flowers.  All right.  We're going to check it out.  I got one thing to say about Anal Cunt.  Like, there's a lot of people that get really mad when their band gets popular.  Like, oh, man, you sold out.  Every band wants to sell out except for Anal Cunt.  Anal Cunt.  Anal Cunt is all by themselves as far as, nope, we never want to sell out. 
[04:19:30]  I think you picked that name and you know that.  You just know.  You drew a line in the sand when you were like, let's call ourselves Anal Cunt.  It's always those bands you feel like you discovered first and then the mainstream picks  up on and then you get mad that they sold out.  Every band wants that.  Queens of the Stone Age was on like a T-Mobile commercial and I was like mad that everyone  I was like, that's our band.  Right.  But good for them.  They got fucking a ton of money.  We listened to a Queens of...  Oh, my...  Yeah, don't matter. 
[04:20:00]  I was in Philly.  My brother had Queens of the Stone Age cracking.  That's fucking great.  Oh, my God.  A lot of songs I don't even know and they just...  I love their sound.  Very underrated band, man.  Yeah.  I'm their A&R guy now.  Yeah, right?  Put that...  Add that to the post.  Well, that guy thinks the Summertime song sounds like Anal Cunt's Picnic of Love.  By the way, I bet it won't sound anything like it.  Let's see.  Anything.  I never get anything right, these listeners.  Here's Anal Cunt, a picnic of love on your home of rock and roll. 
[04:20:30]  You're listening to 99.1.  Pew, pew, pew, pew.  It's the Wolf.  30 minutes of nonstop music with Anal Cunt.  A little Anal Cunt for you, people.  My high school sweetheart and my girl next door.  You've been my lifelong best friend.  And so much more.  It doesn't.  We matured into each other's arms.  Coats to guitar and band vocals. 
[04:21:00]  You blossomed into the woman who owned my heart.  You're my woman.  My lover.  My friend.  That's good stuff.  I pushed you by the swings we played in the sand.  Structurally, it's blowing summertime out of the water.  Yeah, that's true.  Does he sing about fucking her in the ass or anything like that at some point?  When does the joke kick in? 
[04:21:30]  I know these motherfuckers.  I think this is the joke.  Uh-huh.  I gotcha.  That there's no joke.  You're my lover.  You're my lover.  My friend.  My woman.  My friend.  You're my woman.  My lover.  You're my best friend.  Transiteered woman.  It sounds more like Dirk Diggler. 
[04:22:00]  Yeah.  His little song.  You got the touch.  Feel, feel, feel, feel my heat.  You can just imagine John C. Reilly in the sound booth.  Feel, feel, feel.  Yeah.  Feel my heat.  And John C. Reilly goes, feel my heat.  Yeah.  Those are.  Yeah.  The tapes are yours.  But the magic on those tapes?  Magic on those tapes.  It's pretty accurate.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I mean.  It's, you know.  It's off key.  At least Anal Cunt was trying to be funny.  I appreciate Anal Cunt slowing it down a little bit.  Yeah.  You know. 
[04:22:30]  Taking it down.  More of the ballad.  Showing the sensitive side.  Yeah.  Their love song.  It's not like.  It's not like.  I intentionally ran over your dog.  Or.  You know.  I fucked your wife.  Let me hear this.  Are those other hits?  Yeah.  Those are some of the other AC hits.  I got an office job for the sole purpose of sexually harassing.  Yeah.  That's the name of the song.  Yeah.  The only reason men want to talk to you is because they want to get laid.  You stupid fuck.  Oh.  So why don't we play one of these?  It's just to show the people.  I want to hear Feel My Heat first though.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'd love Feel My Heat.  You want to take it from the top?  From the top?  Yeah.  Let's try it.  Let's try it. 
[04:23:00]  I will rock you.  He will rock you.  He will roll you.  Baby, don't you know.  My heat will move your soul.  Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.  Love me today. 
[04:23:30]  This is so good.  Love me tomorrow.  All day, all night.  You feel my heat.  Feel, feel, feel, feel my heat.  I think we should repeat that again.  Feel, feel, feel, feel, feel.  Feel my heat.  Feel my heat. 
[04:24:00]  John C. Reilly is great.  Fucking best, man.  I love John C. Reilly so much.  That whole movie is so fucking good.  It's amazing.  It was my top three.  It is so fucking good.  Did anyone ever record that song?  Legit?  Feel my heat.  I don't know.  I don't know.  It's magic.  You got to think some band really just went all in and recorded this legit song.  I'm always so disappointed on planes, I tell people my name's Eddie from Torrance.  Oh, yeah.  No one.  Eddie Adams from Torrance.  No one.  Todd Parker?  He's the cool guy. 
[04:24:30]  I didn't think you danced.  I don't dance on Sundays.  Let's do the AC now.  Which one do you want to play, Chops?  Which one?  Guys, it's your show.  I mean, do you want Hitler was a sensitive man?  Do you want dictators are cool?  Hitler is a sensitive man.  I think that's going to be another slow one, to be honest with you.  That does sound like a love ballad.  Yeah.  We got to go with one of the fuck songs.  I want to go.  We should look up the only reason you got hired.  Oh, right.  The sexual harassment.  Sexual harassment or only reason men are talking to you so they can fuck you. 
[04:25:00]  All right.  Well, you know what?  Very wordy titles.  I don't have time for both because, you know, I got an office job for the sole purpose of  sexually harassing.  It's only 55 seconds.  All right.  Let's do this.  They're all very, very, very fast.  It's a great place to work here without being harassed.  Yes!  Yes!  Yes!  Yes!  Yes!  Yes!  Yes!  Yes!  Yes!

[04:43:00]  and play  wwe 2k14  totally  on the reg  on the reg  on the reg  how did eroc blow  your mind  he was like  you should have  the red rooster  win the heavyweight  championship  and i was like  you know what  considering i'm  the vince mcmahon  of my own  wrestling league  yeah  i think i might  put him over  why not  i think i might  fantasy booking  to the next level  yeah  it's the best  well we were  asking you  about wrestlemania  oh it was so  much fun  like my wife  didn't even go  this time  well i mean 
[04:43:30]  your wife knows you  right  so she shouldn't go  no  and it's  i was like  well i'm going  to new orleans  if you want  to go  but we're  really not  going to see  a lot of  new orleans  we're mainly  going to see  the inside  of arenas  and hotels  we could be  in any city  fan access  yeah we could  be in whatever  it's going to be  wrestling events  we might as well  be in new york  see my girlfriend's  learning that  because sometimes  she goes on the  road with me  like to a city  for a couple days  and i'm like  we're not going  to see the city  we'll see it  a little bit  during the day  but then you're  going to see  the comedy club  that's it  and the inside 
[04:44:00]  of cars and hotel  and so now  she's like  all right  i'm like  i'm going  to fucking  austin  she's like  yeah i know  you're doing  moon tower  yeah  have fun  at the festival  that's it  and people  were coming  back like  when i came  back people  were like  oh did you  enjoy your  trip i was  like it was  maybe the  greatest trip  i've ever  been on  yeah  and they  were like  oh was  that your  first time  in new  orleans  i was like  i guess  did you try  any food  you could  i mean  yeah i had  room service  a couple nights  but it's  chicken tenders  what difference  does it make  where i'm at  the honey  mustard sauce  was pretty  decent  yeah it was  fine  it was  kunk 
[04:44:30]  like it's  the same  shit  yeah but  who blew  your mind  like who  running into  because you've  met a lot  of wrestlers  yeah  was there  anyone that  you saw  there that  you're like  i mean  there are  little things  that like  put everything  into perspective  for me  because when  everything  first of all  i've been doing  this for so  long and then  everything going  on around me  and the people  in my life  for instance  opie anthony  and jim  don't give a  shit about  wrestling so  nothing's  impressive to  them  yeah  but i'm in  the hotel  lobby  and uh 
[04:45:00]  i'm hanging  out with uh  kevin who  is maria  menuno's  boyfriend  because she  was there  for the hall  of fame  and he  sees this  happen and  that's when  i knew  okay some  people care  about this  scott hall  razor ramon  was walking  around of  course and  he goes oh  what's up man  and i go hey  how's it going  and he goes yo  you seen  pac anywhere  referring to  x-pac  and i go oh  i just saw him  over there but  he's around  he's like oh  okay cool  and that's when  kevin goes  dude you're  like almost  in the nwo 
[04:45:30]  i mean this  is a man that  regularly sleeps  with maria  menuno on the  daily and that  doesn't impress him  yeah and he was  like dude you're  almost i mean  that's i know for  a fact has had  physical relations  with maria  menuno yeah and  he's sitting there  going dude you're  like almost in the  nwo did you just  nwo  you said hello  to the bad guy  yeah yeah  i was like i was  like okay  all right well  then i won't  believe anybody  else i am cool  yeah every  i just imagine 
[04:46:00]  every room you  walked into for  the rest of the  weekend  one thing i was  actually hoping to  see on sam's  instagram and i  guess it didn't  happen but after  the hall of fame i  saw carlito was  there oh yeah  because of sam's  hair i was hoping  the two got a  photo together  but i guess  what happened to  carlito cool he  quit yeah he  quit he didn't  like it he didn't  think he was  getting pushed  hard enough oh  really because i  thought he got  pushed too hard  you're enough with  this dude and  now his brothers  are paying the 
[04:46:30]  price for it  is he they're  almatadors oh  that's his brothers  that's uh  let's go and  primo i hate to  tell you guys this  we're going deep  right now we're  going a little  deep and the  problem with eric  the problem with  eric is he's like  a little kid with  this like me i'm  like a little kid  with it too so i'm  not insulting eric  because i'm right  there with him  but he doesn't  but he doesn't  have he doesn't  put his broadcaster's  hat on okay when  you start talking  about wrestling yeah  and as deep as i'll  go he'll dive in  like he won't even  he won't dip his  feet in i'm talking 
[04:47:00]  12 foot olympic  pool he's like the  soldier bottom  he's like the  cannonball right  yeah you're like  the soldier that  likes war and you  forget that we're  there for diplomatic  reasons right and  you're like i'm gonna  make a new year  necklace like no  no you can't do  that eric hangs out  with the malaysian  airplane that's how  deep eric goes he's  just in the bottom  of the ocean nobody  can find him and he's  talking about los  metadores which i  appreciate i thought  by the way once the  mics go off i'm here  with you so don't get  me wrong i'm not  saying it's a bad  thing i'm just saying 
[04:47:30]  at some point you have  to listen you have to  care about these  listeners  i know you don't  friday you don't i know  uh sal why don't we  hear line of the day  because dan soder's here  and we need to get eric  off this wrestling kick  uh what's this whiteness 
[04:48:00]  thing oh that's uh the  greatest thing on the  face of the earth  that's fucking awesome  god damn it sal  oh that was funny  um let's go to bruce  in louisiana  what's up bruce  hey sammy  hey buddy  uh let me ask you a  straight up serious  question  please only serious  if you got a if you  got an unpaid internship  that was not a  guaranteed job but  only a put in the door  to the wwe yeah 
[04:48:30]  would you take that  versus working with  ona and guaranteed  work i bruce like i  don't mean i don't i  don't want to sound  like i have a big head  and i don't want to  burst anyone's bubble  but i think at this  point i could probably  secure an unpaid  internship with wwe as  a matter of fact i  think i go further and  if i really wanted to  i could probably find  a department where i  could get entry-level  salary work yeah i  think probably at this  point i think i would  think so i would think 
[04:49:00]  if i if they've had  this they're offering  you you should be in  that shit dude you're  fucking you're look  bruce i need to tell  you this i'm on the  network i've been on  three shows on that  channel already it's  only been out for a  month well i don't i'm  not gonna pay for  fucking internet tv  shit i'm gonna wait  till i can steal that  shit bro all right  bruce i'll talk to you  later  like the guy who  pays for satellite  radio i'll talk to  you later uh paul in  louisiana or los  angeles hey guys uh  you said earlier that

[04:50:00]  drop of blood in the  water creates an  insatiable appetite to  talk about everything  wrestling that's it and  people who don't like  wrestling don't give a  fuck and they're angered  well they don't  understand it it's like  people that still come  up to me at 30 years  old and they're like  it's fake you're like  yeah i know motherfucker  not only do i know  everyone knows i told  dennis falcone yesterday  was sitting there telling  me that wrestling was  scripted and i said  dennis i want you to go  out on the street i'll
