<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a scathing critique of a new DJ, "Chunky" (Big Boy), at their former station, 92.3.  The hosts mocked a fabricated story in a New York newspaper about Chunky's arduous 14-flight walk to the studio due to broken elevators.  Opie and Anthony highlighted the building's numerous elevators and contrasted Chunky's attempt at new media engagement with their own far more extensive and successful use of platforms like MySpace, Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter years prior.  They played an audio clip of Chunky's on-air meltdown about the elevators and lack of food, punctuated by threats to quit.  They also read tweets reacting to Chunky's story, ranging from supportive to highly critical.  A caller from Canada chimed in to support their perspective on the value of their former Paltalk feed, expressing frustration with the new station's apparent lack of understanding of social media and their employer's lack of marketing support.  The segment included tangents about their former coworker Rocco, infamous for outrageous lies and stunts, including stealing a station van to promote their return.


The show continued with a discussion about another radio personality, Scorch, notorious for his prolific lying and legally problematic radio bits like "Feels for Meals" and "Doucher Dressing."  Numerous examples of Scorch's dishonesty were recounted, alongside further discussion of Rocco's suspension (conveniently timed with his vacation) for the van stunt.  The hosts further mocked Chunky, urging listeners to bombard his Twitter account with negative comments.  The discussion meandered through various topics, including Arlie Ermey's birthday, the World Series champion, Anthony Cumia's toilet-based day trading, a listener request for placemats, an anecdote about cologne, a detailed discussion of sexually suggestive scenes from *A Clockwork Orange*, criticisms of *Band of Brothers* actors' post-production comments, and a news report about a profanity-laced on-air incident in Des Moines resulting in DJ suspensions. Kenny Miller and an unnamed Sam provided audio clips throughout this segment.


Next, the show speculated on the impending firings of radio DJs who had a public on-air argument, predicting a Friday announcement.  Rob Schneider's erratic behavior on a live TV news set was discussed, along with a news story about two DJs suspended for arguing at a high school basketball game.  This transitioned into a listener's request for a racy GIF, followed by a host's embarrassing farting incident and discussion of unusual sexual practices. The hosts then showed pictures of women's breasts, one set clearly fake, and engaged in extended bathroom humor, including a detailed discussion of bowel movements and phone call etiquette.  Kurt Schilling's retirement and a story about a pregnant man were briefly mentioned.  A previous guest, "Liz," was called "shithouse rat crazy" after a previous appearance.  The increasing use of the f-bomb on television, and the government's lack of intervention due to economic concerns, was noted.  Extended discussion of the blossoming friendship between staff members "Club Soda Kenny" and "Master Joe" followed, along with humorous speculation from other staff members about their relationship. Attempts to develop a comedic bit around this were thwarted by Sirius's policies.  The show then discussed a Facebook group renamed from "I Heart Jews" to "Hitler, the greatest man in history," followed by a discussion of "Chick Chat" (a local news segment featuring female anchors with Rob Schneider in the background), and the high cost of raising Octomom's octuplets.  The segment concluded with a graphic account of the murder of radio personality George Weber, including speculation on the motive and killer, and further discussion of bodily fluids and sexual practices. Jim Gaffigan and Kurt Angle were mentioned as upcoming guests.


Comedian Jim Gaffigan then joined the show.  The conversation started with donuts, comparing Dunkin' Donuts and Baskin-Robbins to "two pairs of dirty underwear."  Gaffigan discussed the pressures of social media, admitting to fabricating a tweet about playing cowbell with the Allman Brothers Band.  They discussed their own social media "experiments" and people's tendency to believe online content. Gaffigan promoted his *King Baby* special.  The conversation shifted to Gaffigan's vlogs (featuring guns) and a military channel sniper competition show, leading to a darkly humorous tangent about a hypothetical serial killer seeking feedback on body disposal methods on Twitter.  A significant portion focused on "To Catch a Predator," recounting a prank played on Chris Hansen and instances of listeners getting arrested while wearing Opie and Anthony merchandise.  "Crazy Liz," a recurring caller, joined the studio, engaging in bizarre conversations.  The hosts described her previous day's behavior, which included nudity and sketching. Much of the conversation involved her mental state, medication, and unusual behavior.  Professional wrestler Kurt Angle then joined the show.


Kurt Angle discussed his career transition from WWE to TNA, citing overwork and injuries (including four broken necks).  He detailed his painkiller addiction following his injuries, lack of WWE support, and admitted to using legally prescribed steroids (and subsequent suspension due to expired prescriptions). He discussed his divorce, partly attributing it to his wifeâ€™s involvement in the wrestling business, and expressed a desire to maintain a positive relationship with her for their children.  He discussed TNA's "Main Event Mafia," the careers and personal lives of various WWE wrestlers (Mick Foley, Stone Cold Steve Austin, The Rock), rumors surrounding other wrestlers, a female wrestler he dated, and the perceived change in wrestling culture. Sam Roberts ("Primetime Sam Roberts") engaged in comedic exchanges with the hosts and Angle. The segment concluded with promotion of TNA Impact and Lockdown, and a final mention of Danny Bonaduce's upcoming appearance.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  The Opie and Anthony radio show, the most popular show in the history of satellite radio.  But enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  You know what I love about that?  Ah?  The Jay Leno thing right there at the end?  Yeah.  We cut Jimmy out of it.  And Jimmy is...  Oh, that's right.  And Jimmy's the whole reason...  Jimmy's the reason...  That we got that fine intro from Jay Leno.  But that's alright.  Now it sounds like it's just us.  It's just us. We're on the show and, you know, I don't mean to brag, Jay,  but I guess you are right. 
[00:00:30]  We are the most popular show in the history of satellite radio.  It's alright.  It's all because of Jimmy and they cut you out.  In fairness to them and their bumbling incompetence,  it actually wouldn't have fit to keep me...  That was the perfect way to end it, I have to say.  Anthony's reading a little article, huh?  Oh, my God.  We like to keep everyone abreast.  I like using the word abreast.  Who doesn't?  Oops, audio. 
[00:01:00]  What happened?  What happened?  Audio.  There we go.  Very good.  Now we're broadcasting.  We like to keep everyone abreast on what's going on at our old station.  Yes.  When we were also doing regular radio.  Regular radio.  You remember back in those days?  It really feels good when you're replaced by a jukebox.  It really makes you feel good about what you do for a living.  10,000 top 40 songs or whatever. 
[00:01:30]  Yeah, 10,000 pop songs.  It's top 40.  And they have 10,000.  And David Hinckley, who completely ignored us when all hell was breaking loose with our radio show.  Matter of fact, he never even wrote that we were fired, let go, whatever the hell you want to call it.  No, nothing.  When he's, his whole job is to write about New York radio.  Yeah, like that was kind of a story.  He had some kind of bug up his ass for us.  Whatever.  But now he's writing about 92.3. 
[00:02:00]  What is it called now?  Now?  Now.  Now.  Because it's happening.  It's happening.  It's now, dude.  Aren't we happening right now?  Apparently not, I guess.  I don't know.  Yeah, well.  Well, when you call a station now, you've got to be on the cutting edge, dude.  That's what it's about.  You've got a bunch of cranky broads working for you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Another.  Well, they're stupid now.  Well, good news.  They hired a guy named Chunky.  Well, Chunky has made the on the radio column by David Hinckley. 
[00:02:30]  I guess his real name is Big Boy, but there's too many big boys in the radio business, so  he had to change his name to Chunky.  He's fat.  He's just a fat guy and another fat fucking radio.  Yeah.  Apparently.  But let's see.  The elevator.  What?  Good gravy.  This is in the paper, so it's got to be important.  What?  What happened to the elevator?  Broken?  What happened? 
[00:03:00]  It was busted.  I guess Chunky got in it, and it couldn't lift it.  Did he plummet to his death?  No.  Now, that would have been a news story.  Well, if it's in the paper and an elevator broke down, what happened?  He's severed an arm or something?  A limb?  Apparently.  Apparently, and this is just, I find this not true.  Okay.  I think this is lying.  He had to walk 14 stories to reach the studio.  Oh, my God.  There's, how many elevator banks are there at that? 
[00:03:30]  One, two, three, four, five, six on that side.  And then you could take the other one up to, like, the 20-something floor and then back  down to the 14th.  And maybe on that third hallway, there might be three more.  So there's at least nine.  Maybe 12.  Yeah.  Believe me, all the elevators don't go out in buildings like this.  So everyone should call Chunky today and go, Chunky, you lied.  Yeah.  You're trying to tell me that every single elevator was busted?  Yeah.  Well, Chunky is aptly named, says Mark Mason. 
[00:04:00]  Yeah.  Vice President of Digital Media for now.  Mm-hmm.  Parent company CBS.  When he got there, he was puffing and sweating.  Yeah.  Something tells me he puffs and sweats when he answers his phone.  Old Chunky.  I'm not too bitter.  Don't worry.  Like any good Top 40 DJ, he mentioned the climb on the air.  Like any good Top 40 DJ, he mentioned the climb on the air.  Yeah, because Top 40 DJs are boring as shit. 
[00:04:30]  They're supposed to not talk, first of all.  So this is something that's very exciting for a Top 40 jock.  There was some tween girl going, shut up and play the music.  Play Lady Gaga.  I don't care that you had to walk up 14 flights of stairs.  I don't care what Chunky has to say.  Mom.  Mom.  Why is Chunky talking?  Chunky's not supposed to talk.  He's supposed to play 10,000 songs in a row.  I'm going to text my friend Jen and tell her.  I'm going to tweet it.  Well, it's all about the tweeting. 
[00:05:00]  Well, apparently.  I wonder where they got that idea.  See, this is breaking news.  This is.  Oh, this is fantastic.  Yeah, go ahead.  See, he talked about his big climb on the air, but it didn't stop there.  Oh, no.  No?  No.  It didn't stop there.  Or with tweets and text alerts to mobile phones.  He and his colleagues have flip cams.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  I got to slow you down.  So he thought walking up 14 flights of stairs, which he did not do, because now they have 
[00:05:30]  to invent cool things that are happening to them.  Right.  Because they got all this new technology they want to try.  Yeah.  I got them figured out.  But the stupid whoever's in charge over there is like, oh, my God, you've got to be talking  about your life.  And Chunky's sitting there going, oh, but I don't have anything going on in my life.  Well, just make something up.  How about I make believe that I walked 14 flights of stairs today?  That's good for a fact.  Go ahead.  That's good.  Good.  Tweet it.  Tweet it.  Tweet it.  Text message it.  Text it.  We're now.  We're now.  We're 92.3 now. 
[00:06:00]  So there's a multi-platform thing going on, but they have nothing to talk about.  So now they're making up crap like Chunky walking up 14 flights of stairs.  Yeah.  You don't think you really had to walk up those steps?  Hell fucking no.  We know that building.  Yeah.  There's not one elevator.  There's banks of elevators that go to various floors you could get.  Believe me.  You ain't taking the stairs.  How long were we there?  Three years.  Did we ever have to take the stairs? 
[00:06:30]  No.  No.  No.  One time we had to take an elevator.  Up past our floor and then back down again.  That was a hassle.  Because it's in a different elevator bank.  Because we actually had to walk across that floor to the banks to come back down.  I tweeted it.  Really?  Yes.  I wish I did.  Oh, it was fascinating.  I wish I did.  Well, the tweet alerts.  I'm going to tweet my grapefruit.  The text alerts.  You know, I think we're all guilty of boring food tweet pictures. 
[00:07:00]  You know what, though, we've never, no, our tweets and our Facebooking and all that crap  is way better than talking about walking up imaginary floors that never happened.  Well, the thing is, they're talking about these tweets, text alerts on mobile phones,  and he and his colleagues have flip cams.  Okay.  So he could simultaneously send out video to the station website and through social networking  sites like Facebook and MySpace.  Really? 
[00:07:30]  Wow!  That sounds like something we have been doing for years.  This is something we have to jump on, I think.  Yeah.  And start doing, oh, that's right.  We've been doing it.  I guess they took a few of our things.  Yeah, I think a few people.  Now, look, look.  I am never going to say we were the first ones to be doing this, that, and the other thing.  Just go who, who, and everyone is.  Who, who, who, who, who, who.  As far as electronic media goes and tying into the fans through different things than just 
[00:08:00]  broadcasting our stupid voices over the air.  But we were right there with MySpace, Facebook, putting things on YouTube, tweeting.  Opie was tweeting before a lot of people, before the whole thing.  Because now, I mean, it's really in the news.  Some say that I brought it to the forefront.  Well, you invented it. 
[00:08:30]  Who, who.  Well, according to Ronnie, I invented Twitter.  By the way, there's some dope on one of the, one of the fan sites, and I don't even.  No, that doesn't exist.  There's not dopes on the fan sites.  I don't even know why I go there anymore, because there's still people just trying to knock  everybody down all the time.  There's an idiot that is convinced that Twitter is paying me.  And that's why I talk about it so much.  No, I talk about it so much because it's a really cool thing, and it's something I got  excited about.  Sorry.  Cha-ching there, Opie.  Cha-ching.  That's right.  Nice endorsement. 
[00:09:00]  But this guy is convinced, and then everyone has to jump on, like, you know, you might  be, you might be onto something.  You know, that's the first thing I thought when you just brought it up.  Holy crap.  Endorsement.  Can you just let things be?  Everything was endorsed, yeah.  Instead of trying to break everything down to some ridiculous poison, can you just let  some of this stuff be?  It's, it's, it's just a, a, organic thing.  I, I, I, I finally found something I like.  Anthony even, like, complimented me when we were talking the other day.  He's like, wow, it's kind of cool that you finally found, you know. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah, some electronic medium.  Right.  Besides, you know, the block game.  But this guy's trying to get something going.  I think he's working for Twitter.  I think they're paying him.  Do you know how long I went on PalTalk and people actually thought PalTalk was paying  me?  Just stop.  For doing it.  It's, it's a great outlet, these things, to put shit out there that you, you know,  don't put out on the air.  You put it out and want to enhance it visually.  Think, uh, put a few more words to it.  Whatever.  I'll tell you this, this is where we're stupid. 
[00:10:00]  I mean, you know, Howard doesn't.  Where does the list start?  Howard doesn't do anything unless it means money for him.  We, we do things to try to, like, make the experience a little, a little deeper for everybody.  Enhance the show, bring people in, a little more immersion, a little more, um, uh, a little  connected with the show a little more.  Because guess what?  When we move to the other place in two weeks, they're taking our PalTalk away from us.  Because they can't, they don't.  Well, you're kidding, right?  No.  No, no, I'm not kidding, Jimmy.  They're taking PalTalk for now.  They see no real upside to giving away, um, a one inch by one inch video feed. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah.  And audio that apparently peters out every five minutes.  Yeah.  Um, not, not, no, any fault of PalTalks.  It's the software here.  Sure.  Uh, but, but it's like, don't you realize that people see that they get it?  They get it from all over the world where they wouldn't be subscribing anyway.  And then people that are in the country that then subscribe because they want to kind of  hear the show crystal clear. 
[00:11:00]  And, and a lot of people watch on PalTalk, but listen on XM.  Right.  Uh, they just, they don't see.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  Whatever you're saying, Jim.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I got it.  What's your opinion?  He's biting his lip.  Yeah, I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  Do you got it?  Unless it's a 38 caliber bullet, you don't got it.  This is the problem we run into time and time again, these, uh, these suits, they need 
[00:11:30]  to see like money right away for everything when they don't understand that something like  that enhances our show, makes it bigger, which eventually leads to more people listening  and subscribing to this channel.  The only equity they see is the old greenbacks.  They don't see equity in the fact that people getting on board, um, just a few hundred at  a time here and there.  It's not like you're giving away this to thousands upon thousands of people, a few  hundred here and there checking it out, going to their friends, talking about it and their 
[00:12:00]  friends, uh, might not have a pal talk at all.  Oh, where are these guys?  Oh, XM.  Oh, I'll subscribe.  I got to tell you, I'm very excited at, uh, the master plan they have for us because  when we sat down with these guys, they said, look, let me tell you something.  You guys are a very, very talented radio show.  This is exactly what was said to us.  And, uh, you were just underappreciated at XM.  You weren't marketed right.  You weren't pushed out there.  Right.  But if you want to really see underappreciated, but they're like, you know, we got big plans 
[00:12:30]  for you guys, you know, and we can't wait.  We're very excited to have you on board, blah, blah, blah.  Since that day, they took away our star booker.  They're taking away our studio, throwing us in a tiny little closet that they're taking  away the pal talk.  The pal talk, the taking away pal talk is just, it's a lack of insight into what kind  of gets people talking about something.  Yes.  Yeah, I know.  Yeah.  We have chicks in here or like we have Pat from Munaki or doing something, whatever we're  doing, something stupid.  Yes.  And we have all these people, they just come in and they watch it live. 
[00:13:00]  And they can see it.  Do you really think that you're giving away the franchise by a few people listening in  a room?  Well, most of them have the service anyway.  Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy.  What we are doing is, hold on, let me explain to you, Jimmy.  You're giving away a free video feed, which isn't good.  Okay, then can we videotape something and put it out and make, no!  No.  So they got a master plan for us.  I can't wait for when it kicks in.  I can't wait for what's next.  It's been, I think we've been part of this whole thing for eight months now. 
[00:13:30]  No marketing, no nothing.  We'll see.  Business as usual.  Well, at least, you know, please.  Just tell us it's business as usual.  Well, you know, we've been around long enough to know that, huh, you're just kind of saying  things.  I'll talk maybe a winnable battle.  Yeah, we'll work on it.  That may be a winnable battle.  Anthony, we've got to get back to Chunky.  He's in the New York paper, but Psycho Bob has a Chunky update.  Psycho Bob, yes.  Rumor has it that Chunky is cleaning his ears with a Q-tip. 
[00:14:00]  Well, I hope they get that Q-tip on Twitter.  I won't believe it until he tweets it, my friend.  I don't believe anything until I see it on Twitter.  Twitter.com for your social networking needs.  Oh.  Let me continue a little with the story here.  Everything about this...  Yes, sir.  Everything about this station is happening now, says Mason.  The website and other platforms aren't tag-alongs. 
[00:14:30]  They're all part of what we do.  What we do.  So when afternoon host Lisa Page asked for shopping tips, it can spark a real-time conversation  on air.  Boo!  Through the text messages and the website.  Oh, my God.  Shopping tips.  That's what's going to get it done on regular radio, shopping tips with Lisa Page. 
[00:15:00]  Wow.  How about when we had a real-time video going of E-Rock getting his armpits waxed?  Yes.  And a pal talk going of celebrity interviews on the couch and Gallagher trashing the joint  and things like that.  And then just guests coming in and your Twitter things, Facebook, same thing, videos that would  go up on Facebook related to the show.  It astounds me that they are making this article and stupid David Hinckley is just taking it hook 
[00:15:30]  line and sinker.  Right.  That this is new to this now thing?  Well, we would, and I hate saying this because it sounds like do who who who.  But come on, man.  We were pounding this shit.  We always did the technology thing alongside our show.  Right.  It's always been right there alongside the show. 
[00:16:00]  We were the first ones to have women faxing their boobs.  That's how old we are.  Faxing.  I remember incorporating the fax machine on a radio show.  I remember putting a website together with HTML to put pictures up that night.  Yes.  Because you couldn't even do it on the fly.  That night of stuff we did that day on the air.  And it sounds insane now because it's just instant.  But then it was like, oh, my God, you know, I'm able to hear the show.  And then that night I go home and download pictures of what was going on in the studio. 
[00:16:30]  Right.  And it just, to have him do an article like this with Chunky walking up the stairs.  Holy shit.  You know, it would be a great tweet if he had video of them kick-starting his heart after he climbs up those stairs.  Hey, you're missing the best part of the article, my friend.  What?  It's a restaurant review.  Oh, damn.  Right.  What was the restaurant review? 
[00:17:00]  Might have been reaching for it.  What was that?  The restaurant review.  They're getting some kind of network of people together and they discuss, like, the best restaurants to go to in Brooklyn or something like that.  Well, that's part of it, Ophi.  I'm grabbing the wrong paper.  Well, I'm insane over here.  But, yeah, they got, by the way, Chunky, let me, don't get too upset.  Chunky has 22 followers.  Oh, my God.  They're doing a whole article. 
[00:17:30]  This is how much David Hickley hates our guts.  They're doing a whole article on how they're using this new technology, Twitter, and Chunky's Twittering everything.  He's got 22 people that are checking out his tweets.  Well, I think a few more might join up after what happens today.  Well, we could do a, I'm thinking about a new effing bit called Twitter Bomb.  Twitter Bomb.  Twitter effing Bomb.  We could test it out.  We could do a Twitter Bomb.  I'm still like.  Old Chunky could be our Manhattan Project. 
[00:18:00]  It's still in my lab at home.  I've got to figure out exactly how this is going to work and what it means.  Ah, Chunk-a.  Ah, Chunk-a.  Well, Chunk-a.  Yeah, the station's also recruiting a growing network of bloggers who talk about, maybe, yeah, great restaurants in Brooklyn.  Or places to find designer clothes on the cheap.  We can simultaneously broadcast and narrowcast, says Mason, through the Internet. 
[00:18:30]  Our signal is worldwide.  And then, of course, one of our advertisers can target a message specifically to people who listen in Brooklyn.  Of course.  So they figure out a way to take it.  Of course.  And Twitter Bomb.  Of course.  An ad.  I guarantee that.  So you not only get commercials now on radio, you also get it through your goddamn Twitters.  I guarantee that's why this whole Twitter thing isn't working for them, because they're spamming the hell out of it.  Oh, yeah.  Who gives a shit crap? 
[00:19:00]  Enjoy your commercials everywhere you can buy, because they don't want it for free.  That's just it, too.  Right.  This is under the guise of, hey, Chunky wants to talk about his stair climb thing.  And then they'll do something for fucking, yeah.  His fake stair climb.  Then they'll, you know, have a commercial that they just kind of Twitter bomb you with.  Yeah.  About Gatorade.  Yeah.  And how he needs to top it off with Gatorade to replace his electrolytes. 
[00:19:30]  Oh, Christ.  I can't get enough of Chunky in his tweets.  Chunky's tweets about walking upstairs.  Erick, can you get Chunky's tweets?  Holy shit.  I don't even know how you find it.  I don't really.  He walked upstairs, and it makes fucking, ah, the paper.  Here's Chunky's social networking app.  He's got 22 friends on Twitter or followers.  He's got 36 friends on MySpace.  And his Facebook still promotes his Detroit station.  All right.  Way to go, Chunky.  All right, Chunky.  All right, Chunky.  All right, Chunky. 
[00:20:00]  All right, Chunky.  All right, Chunky.  All right, Chunky.  All right, Chunky.  All right, Chunky.  All right, Chunky.  All right, Chunky.  Of course, they mention that they're playing 10,000 songs.  Britney Spears, blah, blah, blah, blah, Lady Gaga.  But Theodore says that there's enough audience for another Top 40 station.  What?  Oh, yeah.  Then it just goes into that.  Yeah, it goes into another thing.  People 1834, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, still experiment.  But, well, they're just, you know, talking about the technology thing behind this is what 
[00:20:30]  we were getting at.  And the fact that they're talking about Chunky's climb to the 14th floor.  I got Chunky's updates.  Oh.  Chunky radio, by the way.  Yeah.  He's got three updates.  Ooh.  I think I did three updates in the last hour.  What are you waiting for, Chunky?  Too tired to type?  His peanut butter and his fingers.  Oh, his fingers hit three keys at once.  His first.  Chubby things.  See, because I had to say he's fat fingered.  Wait, he's using Chunky radio, too? 
[00:21:00]  Uh-oh.  See, what happened?  Yeah.  That's what I said.  I was like, uh-oh.  See, Chunky radio.  See, like, OP radio wasn't all over the K-Rock website.  Yeah, okay.  But you can't.  Go fuck yourselves.  Sitting in Baba Booey's old office and watching a building that's on fire on 55th Street.  LOL.  What?  Baba Booey's old office?  That's where we were.  That's three fucking people ago, Chunky.  And they knocked walls down and did shit, so it's probably not his office. 
[00:21:30]  And then his next tweet was, Bout.  That was Steve's office.  It was Steve's office.  Say you're in Steve's office.  That's right.  But why wouldn't you take a picture if the building was on fire and then send that?  Because he's a lying mother.  Because he's a lying mother.  It didn't happen either.  Because he has a boring life and he's got to make shit up.  Then his next tweet was, Bout, B-O-U-T, to go on air.  Oh.  I thought it was Bout with obesity.  Losing. 
[00:22:00]  And then you guys, hold on to your hats.  This one's terrific.  All right.  Saw a huge horse pee.  It should be some, whatever.  Saw a huge horse pee on Fifth Avenue in the middle of the street.  Looked like Mountain Dew spilled all over.  Back to the hotel now, like N2 Deep.  What's N2 Deep?  Is that some kind of, like, street slang?  How about a picture of the horse piss?  Yeah.  You're right.  How about a picture of the burning building?  Well, it would have to happen to actually take a picture of it. 
[00:22:30]  Don't you get what's going on here?  Maybe he doesn't have a phone on his, a fucking camera on his phone.  Maybe he's updating with the old Samsung flip phone that I used to have.  Yeah.  God.  Have you guys heard the Chunky show?  I think you're not being fair.  Sam's actually right.  Sam.  You got audio of the Chunky show?  You're getting punched.  I don't have it yet, but I've been listening.  I'd love to hear a little Chunky.  Who's this kid?  I don't know.  Charlie just came over and tapped me while I was talking.  What's up, Charlie?  Yeah, what the fuck is that about?  What's up, Charlie?  That's on the air.  It's hard for me to come in and tell Sam that N2Deep is a shitty white rapper song. 
[00:23:00]  Back to the Hotel is a shitty song by N2Deep.  Oh, okay.  Thank you.  Figures E-Rock would know that.  I knew that.  So he's trying to...  All right, calm down.  We were goofing on E-Rock, idiot.  Get a hold of yourself, Caesar.  Fucking Claudius.  We were goofing on the original Chunky.  We have our own Chunky.  But yesterday on the show, because Chunky, the reason that this stuff works is because  he does topics that people can relate to. 
[00:23:30]  Okay, Sam.  Like, I think maybe what we were doing is not stuff people could relate to and interact  with us that well.  I'm willing to take the...  It's just constructive criticism.  Chunky came on the air yesterday and said he dropped his phone.  I've dropped my phone.  Exactly.  See?  So he dropped his phone on 57th Street.  He's in the big city, after all.  And it broke.  It doesn't work.  He can't get his phone working.  He sent it on the air.  Oh, no.  So then he opens it up to the calls and the Twitters and the bloggers saying, how many 
[00:24:00]  phones have you broken?  I bet that the calls poured in because we've all had at least one or two happen.  Well, one girl called in with three.  Jesus, poor girl.  What happened?  Stop.  You're listening to this crap?  Well, I want to see what's out there.  I live in the now.  Yes.  I'm not going to be behind the times.  Holy shit.  How did she break her phone?  Did she say, the poor girl?  Well, I mean, I would assume at least one she dropped.  But when there's three of them, there's probably a story behind it.  I should check the blogs.  I'll bet.  Yeah.  You better go check all those blogs to see what the real story is. 
[00:24:30]  Let's say hi to Dave in Canada.  Dave, how are you?  I'm pretty good.  How about you?  Good, Dave.  Yeah.  It's sort of a waste of time.  But what's going on there?  A little bit of a story.  Okay.  I'll speed it up.  You can't be honest with you.  Are you shitting me about taking away the pal talk?  Yeah.  We don't.  Again, it's not 100% yet.  We still have to get into it.  No, it's 100%.  Well, I haven't, you know, we'll see if they can be reasoned with.  Sometimes if you have... 
[00:25:00]  Ant's been trying.  Really?  Yeah.  That's Ant's cause, obviously.  And he did a very good job explaining why it makes sense.  But we'll fight for it, man.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  Okay.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to interrupt.  No.  How does it make any sense at all?  These stupid Canadians are so polite.  Why are you so polite, sir?  We're so polite.  Yeah, right.  Exactly.  This guy, every time he calls, he's like, oh, it's just me.  It's just me.  So polite, whatever, that doesn't make any difference.  But here, look, I know it's not all about me.  Wait, Canadian guy, you watch on Paltalk, right?  Do you also have the service? 
[00:25:30]  Yeah, no, I do.  I have Paltalk.  You know what I mean?  No, no, but...  Like, what service?  I got XM.  That's what I...  You have XM too, right?  You're an XM subscriber.  Yes, I am.  And you also watch on Paltalk.  Yes.  Okay, that's what I'm saying.  A lot of people have both, and they seem to think that everybody's stealing it for free.  It's like, the audio on Paltalk is not phenomenal.  It's average at best.  Most people will listen, and it turns people on to the show.  Yeah.  I bet you more people have been turned on to the show because of that. 
[00:26:00]  Absolutely.  You know, getting it for free.  And the service itself, because, like, all right, we supply Paltalk so people can look in and see what we're doing here.  Yeah.  But then for the rest of the day, when they're driving around or whatever, they're listening to the service on XM, Sirius, whatever, and not on Paltalk.  We just offer a show that's very conducive to video.  And the thing is, we're not doing a five-camera fucking shoot in here.  All right, maybe we are. 
[00:26:30]  Let me look around.  How many cameras?  That's four.  But you know what it is?  It's not...  It's really eight?  It's not...  Eight.  It's not like with these...  Yeah, okay, can I...  Yeah, yeah, it's right.  I was just being a bit of talking on his own show.  It's...  I know, I know.  This hunt...  Like, Anthony, if you guys are taking off Paltalk, all I'm going to be able to do is go to a bunch of black sites and get bounced every day.  That's what I'm... 
[00:27:00]  All right, Dave.  All right, we got it, Dave.  Thank God he interrupted me for that.  He doesn't give a crap that he can hear or see the radio show.  He's still going.  He's talking over your guy.  All right, thank you, Dave.  We got to hang up.  It's so...  It really is a...  Do you see that XM before built the studio?  They put in these Paltalk cameras because they kind of understood that was a part of the show.  Yeah.  You ever look how many people are in the room?  You don't have 5,000 people in the Paltalk room.  Once in a while, you'll have, like, five or six hundred pouring...  When you got some naked chicks in here and stuff, they'll be, like, the most... 
[00:27:30]  Ew, nudity?  Ew.  Ew.  Ew.  When we got that going on, of course, the room's going to fill up.  There's going to be a lot of people.  Yeah.  But the reason they're logging on in those numbers is because they're listening on XM.  Right.  They hear that we have something they want to see, so they log in.  It's not people calling each other, hey, quick, go on to Paltalk.  You know, they just...  They know from listening to the show that they want to see something. 
[00:28:00]  So they are subscribing.  But, yeah, yeah, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it.  I got it.  I got to tell you, I'm excited at what's going to happen to us.  They're completely stripping this show down.  Yeah.  And bringing us back to where we were 12 years ago.  Yeah.  12 years ago.  It's kind of like when you see your favorite band and they get so overproduced and the  stage show is ridiculous and they got like an internet feed of the show and then all 
[00:28:30]  of a sudden you see that same band on tour and they just have a couple of acoustic guitars  and like a curtain behind them.  Got to bring it back to their roots.  I'm so excited that they're breaking everything down that we built up for the last decade and  we get to start over.  Broadcast from the old broom closet.  Yeah.  No studio audience.  No Paltalk.  A studio that's maybe a third of the size of the one we're currently in.  Yeah.  Come on.  Paltalk.  I don't need all these fancy accoutrements.  You know, all the stuff that really, really made our show. 
[00:29:00]  The stuff we thought, knowing the show better than anyone else does or ever will.  Right.  The stuff we thought was good for the show.  Right.  Good for the listeners.  Leaving a lot of our people that we developed over the years behind.  You know, it's all great.  How many times do you think Fat Chunky?  We'll try to do something and then finally get the, oh, that can't go up on the, no,  that can't go up on the website.  You can't tweet that.  See, that's a big horse cock. 
[00:29:30]  You finally got your phone where you took a picture of the horse peeing.  But see, that's horse cock and we can't put that on our website.  How about this one?  Chunky, you're going to have to change your name because it's too close to Chinky.  Yeah, yeah.  And, oh, the Asian.  We got a complaint letter.  Yeah.  We got one complaint letter and we're going to have to change your name from Chunky.  Too close to Chinky.  Yeah.  By the way, we want to tie you into a Chunky candy bar promotion. 
[00:30:00]  We'd like you to broadcast from a candy store and give away Chunkies.  Right.  Really?  Can I tweet myself shooting myself in the head?  I hope that he actually did have a picture of that building on fire and management came to him.  I wouldn't be surprised and go, yeah, you can't tweet that because someone might have got hurt in that fire.  If someone got hurt, it's going to be insensitive.  I'm sorry, Chunky.  And our lawyers have said that you can't tweet that.  As a matter of fact, just tweet stuff that doesn't exist so we can never get in trouble. 
[00:30:30]  Yeah.  Tweet all fake stuff.  Like, you know, walking up 14 flights of stairs.  Talk with Bob, our tweet consultant that we hired.  You know that's coming.  We hired a tweeting consultant.  A social networking consultant.  Yes, a social networking consultant.  And he'll be the one that tells you what can go up and what can't.  Oh, you'll have complete, like, say, except everything you say will be knocked down.  But we'll have our social networking consultant. 
[00:31:00]  And then it'll be in the paper.  Oh, CBS hires social networking consultant.  Yeah.  Well, this is the future.  Yeah.  And this is what it's all about.  Yeah.  You know, regulating the media like the communists do.  Oh, wow.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  All right.  Well, I don't.  Yeah, I know there's other stuff they took away from us, but we better shut our mouths. 
[00:31:30]  Let's just say let's just, you know, I know because we're actually being good.  Yeah, because it gets confused by the suits.  You know, we just try to stick up for our show and what it's all about.  And then we get in trouble.  And then it gets back to our agent as we were, you know, threatening to run in with crossbows  and axes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We just try to stick up for our show because, God forbid, we really like the listening experience  that we give our fans.  We like pointing out things, you know, that have been on our show. 
[00:32:00]  And they never have a good answer because, like, the studio they're putting us in, we're  like, come on.  And they're like, no, we just need to get you over here and then we'll work from there.  I know damn well they throw us in that little box and then, you know, we'll make the best  of it, but we're going to just rot.  They're not going to make it any better from that point on.  It's a tiny little studio in the middle of, like, hallways.  Put us somewhere.  Like, we don't even know where we would put people if they allowed them up there.  Oh, my God.  Other people, they dynamite the walls down to make the rooms bigger. 
[00:32:30]  Oh, my God.  They can't get enough space.  The building looks silly because they extended out two windows 20 feet over the streets of  Manhattan like a tree fort with two by fours under it, nailed.  It's like, if you watched Slumdog Millionaire, you know, the beautiful high-rise?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That would be one radio show host area.  Yeah.  And the rest of us are in the slums down below. 
[00:33:00]  We're running shoeless through the mud, being chased by management.  Falling in outhouses.  As they're pouring hot liquids in our eyeballs.  Right.  To make us behave.  Behaving.  Oh, it's just, you have to laugh.  Yeah.  If you don't laugh, you'll cry.  Let me just tell you.  Or vomit.  Yeah.  Vomit.  I just want a real answer.  We just got to get you over here.  No, we know what's happening. 
[00:33:30]  You're going to, like, give us this nice, cute little studio, and that's going to be it.  Yeah, you got it.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  Underappreciated.  Undermarketed.  They kind of hid you.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  See, but what I think is, I think PalTalk, with the cameras, and especially since it's  two-way, where we can see the listener.  Yeah, yeah.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  No, I know you got it.  But, see, we're able to see. 
[00:34:00]  It's like it's a virtual studio guest.  Right.  If something's happening, I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  But what about PalTalk?  You don't got it.  You don't got it.  You don't got it.  You don't got it.  Unbelievable.  I got to interrupt, though, because we have a Chunky update from our own Sam.  Chunky update?  Sam, what do you got on Chunky?  Sam?  Well, the article was actually right.  Really?  Because you ever listen to the radio and be like, it's fun, but I wonder what it looks  like in the studio?  Oh, yes.  Well, they actually posted video of Chunky on the radio talking about when he was walking 
[00:34:30]  up the stairs.  But couldn't they post video of him actually walking up the stairs, Sam?  Yeah.  No, no, no.  When he was talking about walking up the stairs.  Because if it's all about in the now and always being alert about what's going on in  your environment, the DJ's environment, and all of a sudden you're like, wow, elevator  doesn't work.  I'm going to freaking videotape myself walking up 14 flights of stairs.  Uh, Chunky, yeah, we'd like to have the video of you walking up the stairs, but we've been 
[00:35:00]  told by the lawyer that the building people, for security reasons, don't want the stairwells  videotaped.  Um, so that's, we've had to nix that.  No, no, I gave it my best shot.  I went in there and really fought for you.  Yeah.  How did I fight for you?  I hid under my desk.  Yeah, until it all blew over.  Um, yeah, but to post a video, actually submit a video of you talking about it on the air,  if it passes the lawyer's muster, then we will consider putting it up. 
[00:35:30]  No, all the freedom in the world, Chunky.  Yeah, do your best.  You're welcome here.  No, we're discussing your firing now.  Boom.  It's okay.  All right, Chunky.  Have a good show.  I hope this isn't too inside.  That is exactly what we had to deal with.  That's pretty much it.  Like, what does, oh, whatever.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  Oh, that's a good one.  Yeah, Chunky, um, look, we're, we're, we're working on this. 
[00:36:00]  I know, uh, the budget really isn't that high, but we're working on a green screen.  So we can green screen you walking upstairs and things like that.  It's a lawyer's way around it.  Yeah.  Yeah, we'll see if that works.  Oh, wait.  No, that's been nixed.  Okay.  Yeah, the green screen's been nixed.  We can't do that.  We can't afford it.  It's not in the budget.  Sorry, Chunky.  All right, Chunky.  So have you gotten back to us about the, uh, candy bar promotion?  What you want to do with it? 
[00:36:30]  Actually, it doesn't matter.  We're going to do it anyway.  Yeah.  Sales runs the show.  Right.  Uh-huh.  All right.  But I'm Chunky.  So we got a Chunky, we got actual audio of what Chunky sounds like?  Yes, this is, um, audio of the video that was being taken while he was on the radio.  I want to hear Chunky.  You know what?  I do too, but I want to have a little fun with this.  Well, I know a little something something about, uh, E-Rock.  E-Rock is a fan of the Top 40 Jock.  Oh, I thought E-Rock was a fan of fat people.  Well, he's also a fan of the Chunk. 
[00:37:00]  And mirrors.  Yeah.  E-Rock, come in, come in here.  He's a fan of the Chunk?  Of course he is.  No, I don't know if he's a fan of, he knows a lot about radio.  Little known facts.  He's a lot about shitty radio.  Yeah, he did.  Top 40.  He did a, you, how many Top 40 stations you work, uh, at?  Two.  Two, all right.  You know enough, though.  I want you to, uh, I want you to imitate Chunky without ever hearing him.  What are we about to hear from Chunky right now?  Well, from what I've heard of him? 
[00:37:30]  Uh, of him and just knowing the Top 40.  Here comes a tank hanker, sir.  I'll say this, he's got a bit of an edge.  Oh, Sam.  What a dick.  Sam is so sarcastic.  A bit of an edge.  All right?  Can't wait to hear that.  Yeah.  All right, from what I've heard, um, loud dance beat going behind him at all times.  Really?  Of course.  So that is his heart?  Yeah.  After the big walk up the stairs. 
[00:38:00]  Ooh, very edgy.  And, uh, he'll, he'll give out the text.  Don't do, don't do.  No, I'm not.  No, he, he, he's very.  Or tank or whatever the fuck we call him.  He breathed very heavy.  Yeah, I can tell, it's probably fat guy voice.  He breathes very heavy.  He gives out the text so you can text him.  And then he'll go, uh, we're going to take some more live calls.  Uh, what's going on over there?  Two second pause.  What's going on over there?  And then a phone call will start that has a bunch of beefs.  Where is he from?  Detroit. 
[00:38:30]  What's he doing with a New York hat on?  Well, now he's from New, now he's from New York.  That's true, now.  He used to be from Detroit.  We're talking about now.  He's like a politician.  When you become like, uh, Hillary did it.  Fucking be a phony like that.  Hillary did it.  When you moved to New York, all of a sudden you're on New York's sports.  I was despised in Boston for my Yankee fucking fandom.  Because you didn't embrace the now.  Yeah.  I got you, Sam.  Okay.  Now he's in New York.  So he's got to talk about how he dropped his phone on 57th Street. 
[00:39:00]  Yes.  It's local.  Oh, boy.  See, he's got to sound local.  Anthony, uh, not good.  What?  Chunky.  Chunky's, uh, Twitter's, uh, getting a few people.  Oh.  Oh, no.  Are some other people?  Well.  Uh, tweeting?  Somebody named Psychotic, uh, writes, aside from picking food up and shoveling it between  your teeth, what exercise do you get?  When did you last see your cock?  Who did Psychotic write that to? 
[00:39:30]  Uh.  Chunky.  Oh, no.  Chunky Radio.  Chunky Radio.  Oh, no.  Chunky Radio.  Oh, boy.  That was eight minutes ago.  Sixteen minutes ago, J Cred wrote, 92.3, now FM gayer than a bag of dicks.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Hmm.  Uh, and then about 27 minutes ago, Pierce from, uh, Whackbag.  Yeah.  Hardcore listener.  He writes, Opie and Anthony, we're smashing you for your phony, walked 14 flights of stairs  story.  Fat cunt. 
[00:40:00]  Oh, gee shit.  Chimney Cricket.  Oh, boy.  Come on, guys.  So we should give this guy a chance?  Guys.  This is actual audio of Chunky at our old radio station, which is now playing 10,000 songs  in a row.  I want to hear the old, now playing 10,000 songs in a row.  Right, right.  All right.  Here's the bad part.  The bad part is, I'm a fat guy, and the elevator's broke today.  On my...  Oh, my God.  Does he sound like...  Hey, dude!  What's going on?  Hey, there's also some rock hole. 
[00:40:30]  The elevator's broke, dude.  I'm embarrassed that I know...  Hey, come here, elevator repairman.  I'm going to kick your ass.  All right, Rocco.  Are you?  Are you really?  Are you really?  Is that the elevator guy, or is it Cowhead?  I'm going to kick his ass after another 60 minutes of nonstop music.  Yeah.  Hey, by the way, Marriott, send over another fucking chafing dish of pasta. 
[00:41:00]  I know the battle is they're going after Z100, but Chunky sounds like every fucking DJ on  Z100.  They all have that exact same...  Ugh, I am just disgusted.  All right, let's listen.  Well, guys, let's give them a chance.  Exactly.  All right.  Yeah, Jimmy, you're right.  You're right.  All right.  Here's the bad part.  The bad part is, I'm a fat guy, and the elevator's broke today.  On my first day of work, elevator broke. 
[00:41:30]  Elevator broke.  Fourteen flights of stairs.  Didn't even lose a pound.  And in my contract, I was supposed to have some Subway sandwiches up here, and I'm not  seeing any sandwiches, so...  Actually, this is my first day of work, but I'm actually going to quit.  Elevator, I had a cut.  Up the stairs.  Fourteen o'clock.  Elevator.  Oh, my God.  I quit.  The elevator was broke, and there was no food. 
[00:42:00]  I quit.  Holy shit.  All right.  They wrote about that in the fucking newspaper.  Yeah.  Don't worry.  They wrote...  Shut up.  He didn't quit.  I'm just saying, he didn't actually quit.  Oh.  Oh, okay.  Then it's cool.  He didn't actually quit.  All right.  David Hinkley is a boob.  Holy shit.  He's an old man.  What do you expect?  He's an older man.  He never liked his show.  You know they're loving that in the corporate offices.  They should hire John Hinkley.  Oh, God. 
[00:42:30]  You've got to be kidding me.  For real.  Yeah.  Who's buying this?  They've got a service elevator, too, for a fat fuck like this.  Oh, my God.  They could bring freight up there.  Big dumpsters.  That made the paper.  That break.  Well, all six elevators and the service elevator broke.  Everything.  Yeah, everything.  All at once.  That is big news when that happens.  Enough electricity to power the radio station.  Right.  Not to shoot him up there. 
[00:43:00]  I like to see their cost-cutting things, though, because his contract says he's getting paid  in Subway sandwiches, apparently.  That's par for the course.  I got the official elevator count in that building.  Do you?  Thirteen.  There's thirteen elevators.  Thirteen.  The odd number is the freight elevator.  All thirteen elevators went down, huh?  Yeah.  See, when an elevator goes down to my building and I only got three, the other two always  work.  They're always work.  I've never been in an elevator where the guy said, take the stairs, because a lot of 
[00:43:30]  times you can't take the stairs.  Right.  Plus, you could take the other set of elevators that starts the floor above K-Rock.  Yes.  And just walk down one flight.  And then walk down one flight.  Yeah.  He's got gravity working with you.  Yeah.  It's one flight.  So those must not have been working.  See, he walked up fourteen flights.  So you're right.  No, he didn't.  Just a bunch of liars.  This business is just filled with liars.  I wouldn't even care if it wasn't in the paper. 
[00:44:00]  Right.  I swear I wouldn't even know about it if it wasn't in the paper.  And they wrote about it like, like, like it really happened.  What's next, David Hinckley?  An article on the Loch Ness Monster?  Did you see it?  Chunky, that evening host Chunky, the elevator was broken one night last week, where radio  station ninety through two, two, three now broadcast, meaning evening host Chunky had 
[00:44:30]  to climb fourteen stories to reach the studio.  That's what it says.  There is an absolute lie as the first paragraph in the story.  It is a lie.  God, I got it.  I want to start writing a radio blog or for newspapers.  Fuck the radio.  Do the headline.  Cloverfield Monster destroys New York City.  How about Cloverfield Monster climbs fourteen flights? 
[00:45:00]  Damn, I was right there.  Good job, David.  You're a fucking asshole.  It's beyond me.  But wouldn't you.  It didn't happen.  If you were the radio beat reporter.  Yeah.  Wouldn't you take that and then question it?  Wouldn't that make a better read?  Like, look, there's a DJ saying he walked up fourteen flights of stairs.  I've lived in New York my whole life.  I'm sure Hinkley has.  And that just doesn't seem possible.  Yeah.  And then get into the whole thing.  Why do radio guys have to lie? 
[00:45:30]  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  That would be a good read.  Instead of, like, believing what this fat fuck said on a show.  It's such a Rocco delivery, too.  Dude, it really was.  It was so Rocco.  Yeah.  And, like you said before.  We say Rocco because Rocco used to lie through his teeth, act like a tough guy.  Oh.  He was.  Yeah.  Broke into the boss's office and stole these tickets.  I'm going to be giving them away at 10.15 this evening.  Well, if you stole them, wouldn't you just give them away? 
[00:46:00]  Instead of waiting for the specified time that the program director gave you to give them away?  He bought into every, like, hacky radio bit that the PD threw at him.  I stole the tickets, dude.  He stole the rock box, right?  Rocco, you're outrageous.  You actually stole the tickets?  Dude, I stole the tickets.  But, Rocco, you're going to get fired for that, aren't you?  Yeah, I don't care, dude.  I'm a rebel.  I got the tickets right here.  And at 10.15, I'm going to be giving them away. 
[00:46:30]  10.15.  That's right.  That's what I thought of.  But, Rocco, is that written in the program log?  Why 10.15?  Because I got to get all the new songs in first, like the PD told me to.  And he stole the rock bus, right?  Yeah, I stole the rock bus, dude.  We're driving around in it.  Now, a lot of people working right now are heading to work.  When you get to work today, steal a company vehicle.  A company vehicle. 
[00:47:00]  And then call work and brag about it.  I stole the van.  Dude, I'm in jail.  Not only would you be fired, you would be thrown in jail.  Unbelievable.  But only in radio.  Dude, I stole the rock bus.  And then he would, quote, stop the rock bus to broadcast every 20 minutes.  Yeah, yeah.  Which was when you were supposed to talk on that radio station.  So he'd pull the bus over, power up the boom, raise the boom 60 feet in the air. 
[00:47:30]  Because this was 10 years ago when you still had to do that.  Find the Marty, which could be shut down by the station.  Well, yeah.  Like, the station didn't have to accept his broadcast now that he's Grand Theft Auto and hijacking the station.  Right.  But they would just let him go through.  Yeah.  Dude, I stole the rock bus.  And they're actually helping me with the broadcast.  The engineer has hooked me up with the remote system. 
[00:48:00]  And then he would do, like, his babble, laundry list of the songs he played.  Yeah.  And then would come up with some, like, oh, I think they're ought to be.  Lower the boom.  Lower the boom.  Cowhead hit the gas.  Ha ha.  We pulled him again.  We'll be right back.  We're rock rebels.  Yeah.  Why would you be right back if you stole the rock bus?  Why would you take commercial breaks when you just broadcast?  And wouldn't you just be cursing your ass off?  Jesus.  You're still following the format as you stole the rock bus. 
[00:48:30]  I'd be like, fuck this guy.  I stole the bus.  Oh, you'd be motherfuckering everyone that works at the station.  I'm ramming cars now with the bus.  Fuck it.  I'm raping chicks in the back.  You'd be committing crimes.  You'd be like that tank.  Yeah, you're on a crime spree.  Right.  You're not, like, breaking for commercials.  Breaking for commercials.  Reading liners.  And then, by the way, AF will be down at 10th Show Club this evening.  He's reading station liners.  Still taking care of station business.  Right.  Even though he stole the bus. 
[00:49:00]  Holy fucking fake.  And then he found his radio partner.  Of course, they picked the, you know, a random listener at Fenway.  Fenway Park.  Hey, I need a new radio partner.  So we're going to be at Fenway Park.  And we're going to give out a random ticket seat number.  And who was ever sitting in that seat is going to be my radio partner.  And it just happened to be some guy with, like, 10 years radio experience.  It so happened to be a guy that was trying to get on our show.  We just didn't have room for him. 
[00:49:30]  Yeah.  And he did a bunch of bits for us.  And the guy ended up being pretty cool.  Birdsy.  Holy shit.  But he wasn't the guy that was sitting in the seat.  Right.  Well, he might have been that guy.  Yeah.  Gee.  But let me ask you, what happened if they would have picked a guy who didn't have, had another  job or lived out of state and couldn't do it?  Jimmy, it would have just been crazy.  How could he do a show with that guy?  And if he stole the tickets and said he was giving them away 10, 15, it was seven.  Yeah.  Why wouldn't the boss just come in and get them?  And get them because they're there.  He knows where they are.  Yeah.  And so you can't give these away.  How about firing him? 
[00:50:00]  We're stealing things.  Yeah.  He's obviously got a death problem.  Wait, Rocco also lied about how he got fired?  We got Rocco fans calling him?  Hey, dude.  We can't get enough of Rocco.  Rocco.  We talk about Rocco.  We call him Rocco.  Rocco.  Do you still dislike that guy?  Or would you talk to him about it?  I don't give a shit either.  I don't care.  It's like, yeah, I have no anything for him.  It's a good father for the show.  Why don't you get him on the show?  We should call him.  It's just funny.  Who knows?  Honestly, I wish him nothing but the best.  There's only one guy I don't wish the best on, and that's the Hillman. 
[00:50:30]  Yeah, get him on the phone.  Worcester Chrysler Plymouth, Rocco speaking.  Rocco, you're on the air.  Yeah.  I am?  I haven't been on the air in years.  I'm selling cars, dude.  Yeah.  Hey, quick, buy this car because I'm going to steal it at 10.15.  He's still doing hack radio things while he's selling cars.  Is he selling cars?  I think so, yeah.  We heard, lads.  A lot of those guys fell on hard times.  Yeah.  That sucks.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Whatever.  Whatever. 
[00:51:00]  Vim, what's up?  Oh, I remember living in New Hampshire, and you guys were on, and Rocco, he claimed that  he was hired for the station because he was driving on the highway listening to AFF, and  basically said, oh, I like the station so much.  So I went in and asked if I could sweep the floors for them, but they gave me this DJ  job instead.  Oh, my God, no.  He came from Florida.  He came up from Florida.  I think I got- 
[00:51:30]  He was hired by Dave Douglas.  He's got some old Friday morning quarterbacks, and there he is with a different station logo  on his big fat sweatshirt.  Some Florida station before us.  And he replaced Scorch.  Yeah.  They fired Scorch to bring him in.  Well, because Scorch was pizza or hamburger?  Pizza.  I made a little bit of liquor.  I'm hamburger.  Lots of it.  Scorch used to lie all the time, too.  There's actually another guy there.  Yeah.  Why?  He was suspended for two weeks for something, and he claimed he stole the van and was driving 
[00:52:00]  around town saying, hire Opie and Anthony back, or we're not- I'm not going to give the van  back, and he was doing the same exact fit, the whole- I stole the van van.  Stole the van van.  Ridiculous.  I'm suspended starting tomorrow.  Thank God I made reservations to go down to Florida two months ago, and my suspension  lasts as long as my vacation.  I used to love that.  That's what fucked us up, because when we were growing up in this business, we were such idiots, 
[00:52:30]  and we were getting suspended all the time, and we got fired officially, what, now three  times, I think we're up to?  And no one really believed it, because all these other radio guys were doing the fake  suspension bit.  During their vacation, yeah.  It was a staple of edgy radio, where they would fire or suspend the jock around vacation  time all the time.  I never- I never-  So.  Yeah, yeah.  If a jock had vacation coming up, they would brainstorm with the programs right there.  What can we do?  Yeah.  You've got to do something outrageous.  Yeah.  And then I'll run like a- because the program director always wanted to be on the air. 
[00:53:00]  Yeah.  So he would go into the studio and make a tape.  We regret to inform you that the afternoon show, Rocco, or the night show, Rocco, will  not be on.  He has been suspended for stuff that we do not find.  And he would do a big thing.  Yeah, we'll do that.  Scorch did that.  I'm in trouble, dude.  Whoa, I shouldn't have did that.  Scorch did the fake-  Yeah, he did it while I was there. 
[00:53:30]  He had- because he was- he took a week vacation, so his co-host hosted.  Right.  And his co-host started the show the first day by saying the station suspended Scorch for  a week.  And so he-  For what, though?  He didn't say.  He didn't say.  He didn't say.  He didn't say.  He didn't say.  He didn't say.  Scorch also used to make me go home and write emails for him every single night, because  he liked to do emails and play the email song at 8.50 every day, but nobody ever emailed.  No one ever emailed.  Never.  We never got one email.  So you had to write the email.  I wrote every single email that was on the air, I wrote. 
[00:54:00]  Because he liked to play the email sounder or whatever.  I want to play the email sounder.  It was like a techno beat.  He just loved playing it.  Holy shit.  He used to drive his co-host Paulie insane.  I get the Scorch rules.  Because he just lied about everything.  Hey, Scorch.  Who loves Scorch?  Colin Quinn.  Colin Quinn loves Scorch.  We'll look at the email. 
[00:54:30]  Let's use the email then.  Scorch lied to the point that he didn't tell his co-host Paulie that he was moving from  Syracuse to New Hampshire until the night before his last show, even though he knew  four months ahead of time.  Holy shit.  He told me, the intern, four months ahead of time that he was going to New Hampshire.  He didn't tell Paulie until the night before he left.  Wow.  By the way, tomorrow's going to be our last show because I'm going to New Hampshire.  What a prick.  Why didn't he take the co-host with him?  He couldn't. 
[00:55:00]  He was getting paid very little money.  Yeah.  Good old Scorch.  I'm trying to remember the Scorch bits when we were at a...  Well, did you know Scorch invented Feels for Meals?  Really?  Yes.  Wow.  Was he insane?  He gave you the idea.  No, he didn't.  Yes, he did.  He told me.  What?  Holy shit.  I was a liar.  Yes, he did.  He told me.  It's one of our greatest bits we never...  One of Scorch's greatest bits.  We fucking Scorch.  It's one of our greatest bits that lawyers shut down year after year.  He said you guys got to borrow from each other. 
[00:55:30]  What the fuck is he doing?  What did we ever take of Scorch's?  Feels for Meals.  Oh, my God.  Feels for Meals is the greatest...  You also did a lot with Doucher Dressing.  That was Scorch's, too.  We never did Doucher Dressing.  He said you didn't.  No, he mocked Doucher Dressing.  Doucher Dressing.  Also, he should be coming to XM by December 2005.  He told me that, too.  Right, right.  Remember?  He was going to be on XM.  He's been in conversation.  So we got to get that time machine working.  Yes.  So he should be here by Christmas 2005. 
[00:56:00]  He thought he was coming to XM?  He told me.  Yeah.  He told me.  I started talking to him in probably August.  Wow.  And he said by Christmas he should be at XM.  And then he said, once Christmas hit, he said he should be there by the spring.  And just kind of moved with every season.  That's what every jock does.  He made up conversations.  He said he was talking to Kevin Straley and that they came from the same hometown and they  were on the phone for like 45 minutes just talking.  He just made that up. 
[00:56:30]  He made that up, didn't you?  He made that up.  You made that up.  You can't tell reality from...  He just makes up things.  He's Rupert Pupkin.  Yes.  I was talking with him.  Can we get some more chunky audio?  I want to hear some of you today.  You know what?  It kind of is nice to know that now...  Now.  Let me use the word now.  There is shit...  Somebody that's that shitty on in New York.  So we can actually listen and kind of hear how hacky it is. 
[00:57:00]  God.  That was awful.  And it was in the paper.  Mm-hmm.  If you want, you guys can review his air checks from tonight, tomorrow morning, because I'll  be monitoring.  Well, thank God for you, Sam.  I listen anyway, you know.  Well, of course you would.  It's chunky.  Are you tweeting your orange?  It's called a Texas grapefruit and it's delicious.  Ew.  By the way...  Texas grapefruit.  It's not as good as Chunky's video of him talking about walking up the stairs, but 
[00:57:30]  the video of E-Rock getting grapefruit juice squeezed in his eyes up on YouTube.  Oh, is it?  That is a classic.  Is it good, Sam?  Yes, it is.  It's on YouTube.com slash E-Rock fan.  See, that's got everything.  Drama, pain.  Mm-hmm.  It runs the gamut.  And E-Rock being abused.  E-Rock in great pain.  Someone's asking what Ozone's doing.  There was a rumor he became a woman.  I mean, that was Scorch.  Scorch said that. 
[00:58:00]  Scorch.  Scorch, the compulsive liar said.  Scorch things up all the time.  He seriously...  Dude, he was serious when he said it.  Wait, let Sam tell it.  I'm sorry.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  No, he called in to this show.  He called in to this show.  All right, all right.  I'm sorry.  Yeah, he called in and we were asking him about Ozone and he said, yeah, I heard that  he had a sex change operation.  And what was his new name?  Oh, I don't even remember.  I forgot.  Stephanie or something?  Yeah, but it was straight, but he's like, no, I swear to God.  No, no, he did.  He did. 
[00:58:30]  I heard he got the sex change operation.  And then somebody called up and said...  He's a girl now.  No, it's not true at all.  He's broadcasting out of the city.  Yeah, he's broadcasting.  I listen to his show.  He's fine.  Yeah.  I must have heard wrong.  No, no, no.  He did.  He, uh...  Oh, my God.  Fuck.  Hey, uh...  Scorch.  Good news.  Chunky Radio is getting a lot of people replying to us.  Oh, okay.  Wow.  Probably more...  He's probably going to look at, like...  Yeah.  Wow, a lot of people...  Like, when you first see it, you go like, all right, I'm a hit already. 
[00:59:00]  I'm a hit in New York.  And then...  This was easier than I thought.  Oh, no.  And just goes, oh, no.  Just make this guy's life miserable.  Oh, no.  And then he can't respond because the program director would kill him if he mentioned our  names.  He's doubled his followers in the last hour.  Nice.  What is he up to?  20 now?  41.  Oh, wow.  Club Stoic writes, uh, guess what?  I love pancakes.  Steep Drop Man.  I'm sitting here looking out my window watching your sad radio career burn to the ground. 
[00:59:30]  Jay Cred to Chunky Radio.  Did you roll a bucket of marbles down the steps when you got to the top?  Johnny Maggot.  Chunky Radio's a fat cunt.  David Hinckley, eat my ass.  All right.  That's to the point.  Kevin from Connecticut.  Wow.  I could hear the stakes in your throat.  And then this guy writes, I loved your cameo in Operation Dumbo Drop. 
[01:00:00]  Oh, could have picked a better movie.  His Twitter followers are as bad as he is.  Yeah.  Step it up.  Jesus.  All right.  Anything else on Scorch or Rocco or the Chunky?  Or Chunk.  There's always more Scorch.  We'll just save it.  Scorch is a legend.  He's a goldmine.  But he's going to get this tape and really.  Yeah.  Tell me about me again.  Giving the boys material.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Look what I'm doing. 
[01:00:30]  It's going to be in his intro now.  Me saying Scorch is a legend.  Look what I'm doing.  Yeah.  I hope things I'm a legend.  So, you know.  That's Opie from the Opie Danity Show.  Always thought I was a legend.  Always came in every day.  He goes, Scorch, you're a legend.  I taught him a couple things, you know.  I taught him things.  Fields for Meals.  That was me.  Homeless shopping spree.  I gave him that one.  It was all me.  Me, me, me, me.  He always talked about how you guys thought he was the most badass dude ever for the time  he sat in the coffin with the Undertaker.  The Undertaker's badass.  Badass. 
[01:01:00]  He said, let me explain the coffin thing.  Oh, my God.  He said, those guys wouldn't do it.  So, I was like, yeah, I'll do it.  And they were like, whoa.  Whoa.  We were like, whoa.  This is how lame.  This is how lame that bit was.  They came to Ed and I.  I think they were playing, I think the WWF at the time is WWF.  Worcester Centrum.  Was it Worcester Centrum?  Yeah.  And big promotion.  You know, we were behind wrestling for the most part. 
[01:01:30]  And they're like, look, you guys have to sit in the coffin seats ringside for the entire  match.  It was some kind of Undertaker thing.  Yeah.  We asked, what are the coffin seats?  Yeah.  And they go, the seats, they kind of look like coffins.  Right.  And I'm like, you know, we'll have to look at this.  It's spelled just, it just dripped of hack radio.  It reeked of hack awful.  We wouldn't do this radio.  We're going to sit in front of all our listeners. 
[01:02:00]  You guys are spinning this.  Scorched home.  Yeah.  So, we got there.  We're like, no fuck.  When we got there, we saw that these seats, these, quote, seats, were nothing more than  pine box coffins.  Not even good.  They built them and propped up your head on some blocks, like the, so the coffin was tilted  so you could kind of see in the ring.  And we were to lay down in these coffins.  Right.  While real men were doing their silly wrestling moves. 
[01:02:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Scorch did say you guys were afraid of the coffins.  Yeah.  Okay.  Afraid of the coffins?  I looked at that, looked at it open and go, there is no fucking way in hell I am watching  this match from those coffins.  So, we watched from, no, douche-a-phobic.  It was the worst thing you could do.  You'd look like an asshole.  So, we stood back by, like, by the, where you come in. 
[01:03:00]  Yeah.  Where the wrestlers came in kind of.  The rotunda.  Yeah.  It was like the rotunda entrance.  And the salespeople and management at the station panicking, but, but, but, but, but,  we said, you guys, and they're Scorch, I'll do it.  And so, that saved the day.  I'm like, all right, Scorch, you know, a big wrestling fan, enjoy the coffin seat.  Scorch laid right in there.  He's cheering from the coffin.  Yeah, go get him.  Go get him.  Was Scorch in his wrestling character, Vito Carlucci?  No, he was just Scorch at the time.  Vito Carlucci.  Vito Carlucci. 
[01:03:30]  Yes, he's the wrestling manager, by the way.  Vito Carlucci.  He brought Triple H into the wrestling.  Oh, yeah.  I forgot about that one.  I forgot about that one.  Yes, he did.  Scorch is a compulsive liar.  I basically discovered Triple H.  I forgot about that one.  So, basically, he brought Triple H into wrestling.  Because he was doing it first?  Yes.  Yeah.  And then he...  Vito was.  And what was Triple H doing before he was a wrestler?  Nothing.  He was just a...  He was just friends.  He saw him in the gym.  He saw him in the gym and said, hey, I got something for you. 
[01:04:00]  He's just like working out.  Wow.  Scorch was like, you know, you got the look.  This is Scorch's vision.  It's not Vince McMahon.  You're going to go far, kid.  I can see that.  Come here.  Do you think Triple H knows Scorch?  No.  Triple H has no idea of Scorch's.  What's your name?  Hunter.  Why don't we say Hunter Hearst Helmsley?  We'll just call you Triple H.  Yeah.  All right.  That's good.  That's classic.  Even if you called him by his wrestling name, Vito Carlucci, I don't think Triple H would  know who he was.  Do you know a Vito Carlucci? 
[01:04:30]  Never heard of him.  Was he gay?  Another was Vito Carlucci.  Young Vito Carlucci, Ellis Island, stuck in a cock.  Oh, is that funny, man?  You guys were too scared to sit in the coffins, but Scorch manned up.  Yeah, we were scared.  Scorch, he's a man.  That's what he tells everybody.  Yes.  He said you were afraid of the coffins.  We went up to him and goes, Scorch, we're not sitting in the coffin seats.  If you want to take him, feel free. 
[01:05:00]  He's like, all right.  Yeah.  He's laid down in there.  His arms are flailing as he's cheering.  He kicked back.  He crossed his feet.  He thought it was so badass.  He thought it was so cool to be in there.  And we would just find a video of this.  I remember seeing this on TV, because that's the other thing.  We would have been on TV, which would be more douchey.  No way in fuck I was sitting in that goddamn coffin.  You weren't afraid of it?  New TV time.  No, it wasn't a fear thing.  It was a fear of looking so bad.  Dude, it looked ridiculous. 
[01:05:30]  And this was coming from the two assholes that did bra-bombing.  So that's how bad it was.  It's okay if you're afraid of coffins.  Kamala was afraid of coffins.  Yes, yes.  All right.  I'm not afraid.  That was badass.  Yeah.  Whoa.  That was badass.  Whoa.  Whoa.  What a fucking fool.  He just is a compulsive liar.  Oh, that's great.  Could you get me more chunky audio?  Of course.  Yeah, some chunky audio would be good. 
[01:06:00]  Of course.  I want to hear that beat in the background.  I want to hear how he's like, I want to quit.  I'm quitting after day one.  It's like, well, he might not want to quit.  He's the new star of New York radio.  So we got to be on top of our game.  We got to see what the new star of New York radio is doing.  Dan Hick is a douche.  Yeah.  We got under his skin.  Yeah.  Probably me.  He don't like us anymore.  But we gave him some good fodder for stuff, and he just ignored all of it.  All of it. 
[01:06:30]  He's an irrelevant old man.  Yeah.  He bought into this dopey little radio thing.  The first paragraph is a reporting.  It isn't even like a commentary.  He reported on something that never happened.  Right.  And why didn't he report that even though this 92.3 Now is doing all this social networking  with their radio station that no one is really signing up yet.  Yeah.  It's a complete bust.  Yeah.  Look at the numbers and see like that there's nobody. 
[01:07:00]  Our fans are flooding stupid Chunky's Twitter account.  Thousands.  How many did he have before today started?  I believe it was approximately 20.  Yeah.  20.  20.  Why didn't Hinkley mention that?  Well, I think the Now radio Twitter has like at least 300.  Oh, my God.  It just, it's beyond me.  I don't understand it.  I, I, I don't know.  I'm a Chunky follower now. 
[01:07:30]  Are you?  You bet I am.  You're following Chunky?  I start land.  All right.  Should be.  Son of a bitch.  Now I got to.  Let's all patiently wait for a Chunky update.  All right.  Let me get on my Twitter.  What do you think he's going to tweet?  I don't know.  He's probably getting emails from all this, you know, he probably still gets emails when  people follow him.  Yeah.  So all of a sudden, Jim Norton, Anthony Cumia, and Obie Radio are going to be freaked out.  Yeah, he's going to lose his fucking mind on this one. 
[01:08:00]  And we should just ride him.  We're keeping a very close eye on you, fatso.  We're watching.  Yeah, someone, someone tweet that for us, all right?  We're keeping an eye on you, fatso.  That's right.  Let's take a quick break and we'll continue with some, I don't know, some other bullshit.  That's what we do, right?  That's what we do now.  Give me some more audio, please.  Sam, that's your job today.  Drop everything.  Please.  More Chunky audio.  Got it.  Obie and Anthony, starring Jim Norton. 
[01:08:30]  Arlie Ermey is 65 today.  Happy birthday.  I thought he was older, as a matter of fact.  Get our IDs.  Tell you the truth.  Give me an Arlie Ermey ID.  He has to be older than 65.  You're right.  That's what I thought.  He was in the NOM.  He was a D-I in the core.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Louie Anderson is 56.  Is she?  Thanks, Dan.  Oh.  Did I miss something?  Something good?  Not really good, no.  You said Louie Anderson is 56. 
[01:09:00]  I said, is she?  Wasn't that great?  Yeah, that's good.  The queen.  The queen.  And stupid Japan defeated Korea 5-3 in 10 innings.  They are the world champions.  They are the world champions.  They are the World Series champions.  That's bigger than, yeah.  That's bigger than the World Series.  That is the World Series champions right there, right?  Yeah.  They are the best team in the world.  That's it.  Who won last year the World Series?  Wow.  Wait a minute.  Who won? 
[01:09:30]  I'm not even going to look at instant feedback.  Who won the World Series last year?  Wow.  Jimmy, do you know?  You're a baseball fan.  Philly?  Philly's.  Oh, yeah.  Philly's.  And I should know that.  I was thinking.  I was like, you know, Pittsburgh now.  Philly.  Holy shit.  Nice memory.  Yeah, good one.  The memory of a fucking goldfish.  That's one I should have known.  My God, man.  The Dow up nearly 500 points.  What do you think of that, Ant?  That's pretty good.  It's a bank plan thing that Obama and his peeps threw out there, right? 
[01:10:00]  Yeah, that helped out.  But I kind of made a mistake.  Did you?  I thought about you when I saw the Dow up.  I'm like, Ant made a killing on this because I think he was kind of trading some of that stuff.  I got a little greedy on the shitter.  Yeah, hold on a minute.  I got a little greedy.  Happens.  Hold on.  All of us should pass this proposal to ease the crisis on Wall Street. 
[01:10:30]  All of us now have a stake in solving it and saving our financial institutions from collapse.  This is not the time for fear.  It's not the time for panic.  It's the time for resolve and responsibility and reasonableness.  Live from the O.B. and Anthony Show Studios in Midtown Manhattan, it's Dump Trading with Anthony Cumia.  All right, now we can talk stock.  Dump Trading.  We learned that you like to trade a little day trading while you're doing the number two. 
[01:11:00]  The advent of things like the iPhone, which I use.  I could E-Trade on it.  I got my E-Trade account.  And it's not my retirement money.  You know, I throw some money in there and I see how I do.  And I've been doing pretty good.  I was up to making 100% on my initial investment in about three months or so.  It was very nice.  And then I got greedy with Bank of America. 
[01:11:30]  I saw a couple of days ago, it took a pretty good jump in pre-market trading.  So I bought in at close to $8 a share.  And from that point on, it took a big dump, just like I was taking, on the bull as I was trading.  I reached a point the other day, though.  I was very excited yesterday watching the stock go up. 
[01:12:00]  It didn't go up as high as I wanted it to.  And by the time the icy cool baby wipes hit my hot, burning asshole, it was not time to check out yet.  What had it gone to?  So I'm still going long on it.  I believe we're up to about $7.80, $7.80.  Oh, so you're still down.  I'm still down on it.  It went up over a buck yesterday, which is very good.  I don't mind that at all.  Hopefully they can continue the rally today. 
[01:12:30]  But I think a lot of people are going to be taking a little profit today.  A little profit taking is going to be going on today.  I'll have to do all my research as I squeeze out another one during dump trading.  I find it's easier to trade on the toilet.  There we go.  Successful trade.  Your trade has been accepted.  Stupid dump trading.  Dump trading.  It's great, because what do you do on the shitter? 
[01:13:00]  I used to just, like, I have to read something on there.  Yeah.  I always have to read something to relax enough where everything flows very nicely.  So there have been times, you know, you've got to rummage through the garbage and grab an old toothpaste box or something.  So we go, oh, really?  Right.  You know, you bring up a good point.  And you know my dumps are a lot like they're like nothing.  Like, I could run down the hall and be back within a minute.  Well, I don't know this.  You could be lying like a chunky. 
[01:13:30]  No, you do know.  Just because you see the habit of me going, oh, my God.  And then I'm back a minute later.  What do you think happened?  You shit like a rabbit every day.  It's like 20 fucking times.  And what I want, I want to collect placemats from around the country so I have some reading material.  So all that information.  Yeah, because I don't have enough time to get into a novel or day trade.  Or the New York Times.  Or the New York Times.  I just need a bunch of fun facts and get my learn on. 
[01:14:00]  Get your learn on.  Whoever sends me a placemat from somewhere in the country, I'll give you a little credit.  Maybe I'll tweet them as they come in.  I'll do something with them.  But I want to collect a whole pile of them.  Yeah.  Do we have an address here that they could send their placemats?  111 57th Street?  Hell no.  People understand what this is, right?  It's the dumb stuff in the restaurants.  In a diner.  While you're waiting for the stupid waitress to come to your booth, you're reading.  I like the fun facts of the games.  Right.  A little maze thing. 
[01:14:30]  A maze for fucking mongoloids.  No kidding.  You can't make that work.  I can't find my way out.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hopefully you can't find your way out of the diner as your parents' car is leaving.  Oh, wait.  You know what?  It's only 111 57th Street for another couple weeks.  Yeah, that's true.  I would say, what's the new address?  I bet it'll be forwarded.  It will be forwarded.  Hopefully.  But I don't know if we're going to be allowed with a new company to have placemats sent to  us.  Yes.  That might be somehow they might want to charge the placemat companies for advertising.  So we should find out if we're allowed to have placemats. 
[01:15:00]  I gotcha, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha.  I gotcha, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I got it.  You got it.  So, yeah, I don't know the new address.  We'll have to get the new address.  Yeah.  No, give the old address.  I'll give the old one.  If you want to send your placemats, send them to 111 West 57th Street, New York, New York,  10019 Street 500.  Ooh, sweet.  I like this.  We're in a sweet.  Are we?  Yes.  Yeah.  It's not going to be too sweet for too long.  Two weeks left.  Less than two weeks.  A week from Friday, this is done, I think, right? 
[01:15:30]  Really?  Oh.  A week from Friday, this is it.  Really?  They say goodbye to the bleachers and this beautiful studio that XM put together for  us.  Oh, that they built up.  Basically, the only thing XM did for us, but they at least did this.  A state-of-the-art facility for the show.  Look around.  Huh?  My friend.  My friend.  My girlfriend gets so sad when I do that because he puts the one dab of cologne on each  and she's like, oh, I've never brought a present before. 
[01:16:00]  That was the first present he ever got.  Like, he thought those stupid brushes and everything was beautiful.  He goes, it's beautiful, my friend.  Because his friends got it for him.  Yeah.  And he's parading around the room pretending he's like high society.  Yeah.  He's like talking to himself like, oh, yes.  He had the cane and then he, the way he throws that giant fucking misshapen melon head back  when he dabs the cologne behind his ears.  Just a drop on each ear so he doesn't waste it. 
[01:16:30]  He wanted to conserve it.  Ugh.  Poor guy.  Fuck him, troublemaker.  And then two seconds later, all the shenanigans happen.  People come in to have a little fun with him, spin him around to circus music.  Yeah, they spin him around and he falls down and they're bump dumping booze on his big fucking  ugly head.  Yeah.  And then the guy flicks him a coin and goes, buy yourself a suite.  Buy yourself a suite.  Like, that's all the, that's all that fucking lunk-headed elephant boy wants is a suite.  Like, he's going to be happy with it.  Oh, a suite. 
[01:17:00]  Yeah, if they humiliate him and spill his cologne.  When he pushes that fucking whore's face into his face to kiss and all she's doing is going,  ah, she's screaming, open mouth scream as her mouth is touching his.  And his Elephant Man breath is in her face.  Oh, it's got to be awful.  I didn't see a toothbrush and toothpaste in that kit.  A kit.  You know what movie I finally saw?  What?  Or half of it?  What?  And Clockwork Orange.  You guys have been quoting Clockwork Orange for years and I'm like, you know what, maybe 
[01:17:30]  I should see this movie so I'm in on the discussion a mere three years later.  And I had to stop it because it was time for bed and I didn't want all those wacky dreams  because that movie is fucked up.  It's a weird movie, right?  It is pretty weird.  I love it so far.  It's very Kubrick.  He went through the first stage of watching the movies with his eyelids.  Oh, you got to that point.  That's where I'm at.  Yeah, I'm literally, I cut the movie in half.  It's half done.  Then you'll get to food. 
[01:18:00]  All right.  All right.  But I got to tell you, that Stanley Kubrick knew how to find a busty gal, huh?  He sure did.  Wow.  How sexy.  Wow.  Was that chick getting raped on the stage, right?  You know what?  If we're going to be honest with each other, it was a bit of a turn on, Jimmy.  Absolutely.  I was like, and I was like, why is this a turn on?  I was trying to figure that out in my own little head.  For big, jiggly tits.  They weren't jiggly.  Because I don't want to rape anyone.  And I don't think anyone should gang rape anyone. 
[01:18:30]  But there was something about that scene, absolutely.  And it looked like they were really roughing her up for the movie.  And it was the ability, like, and then the house scene, too.  It was the ability.  It was like this, like, you can do whatever you want here.  It was a really weird feeling, like when he's cutting the fucking redhead.  It was even hotter, I think.  Even though her body wasn't as good as the other one.  Oh, cutting the tits off of her sweater.  The best moment is when my favorite.  Not cutting the tits, though.  Just the fabric that covered the sweater.  Right.  Making two big circles, saying, hello, look at me. 
[01:19:00]  I love when he goes, the sun's in my heart, and I'm ready for love.  And on the word love, he slaps her face.  It is so perfectly choreographed, because it's not love.  Look at that bush.  Yes, you're still sexy, though.  Kubrick loved the bush in his movies.  Well, the bush was in.  Yeah, of course.  What year is this movie?  71.  I was trying to figure out the Roman numerals at the beginning of the movie, and I always  messed that up.  I messed it up.  X, X, ah, fuck, it's over.  I think I went with 81.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I went, oh, 1981. 
[01:19:30]  It really is 71.  Wow.  71.  Yeah.  And if you watch on freeze frame, the scene, because you've seen it where he takes the  dick and he kills Mrs. Woodbear.  Yeah.  Mrs. Webber's Woodbear Health Farm.  Her awful body.  With all those stupid cats.  If you freeze frame that image.  Look, I'm in on the discussion.  Yes.  I feel so good.  Yay.  Because you've got a DVD player, you go back over and watch that, and when he raises  the plastic dick over her face, go frame by frame, and you see all these pornographic  painting images.  Come on.  Like of nipples.  Yes.  But it's paintings. 
[01:20:00]  Like, and a woman's legs open and her pussy lips.  Oh, wow.  Really?  No kidding.  Freeze frame that and go frame by frame.  And you realize in 71, there was no home viewing.  Kubrick really did that for the screen that you were never supposed to know that happened.  Right.  Wow.  And the fucking foresight he had with the little teeny cassette tapes and...  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  When he's fucking...  Yeah, because when I saw the tiny little cassette tapes, I'm like, oh, I didn't know  they were using tiny little cassette tapes, but...  That was years before them.  Yeah, okay.  That was before, uh...  It was 71, that 8-tracks? 
[01:20:30]  Yeah, pretty much.  71, oh, yeah.  It wasn't recordable.  Oh, yeah.  They were barely using cassettes for music, I betcha.  Yeah, cassettes, but it was...  It was all about the 8-track, right?  Yeah, yeah.  It was like, cassettes were like...  You had a big thing with a microphone.  Right.  You wanted to say, you know, I'm going to dictate something.  It wasn't for music, really, or anything like that.  The English know how to make a depressing movie, though.  Just how they, like, they just, like, they landscape their apartments and the towns and  their living environment.  Oh, he's depressing. 
[01:21:00]  Yeah, yeah.  The English really know how to do that shit.  That building that he lived in.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And his father was Grady.  Yeah, from The Shining.  Grady from The Shining.  Yeah.  Where do you suppose it is?  He goes of evenings.  Yeah.  Evenings.  It was just so, uh...  The colors are great, too.  Like, when you watch the first 45 minutes or whatever.  I use the word vibrant.  Beautiful colors.  And then they stop.  And when he goes to jail, it's all, like, dark blues and grays and fucking clouds.  It's really, you know...  Shut the jaw, bleeding ho! 
[01:21:30]  It's well shot, man.  Yeah, it's...  I'm loving it so far.  You're here to save yourself.  Hits him in the balls.  Mr. Deltoid.  Mr. Deltoid, yes!  I love that.  Deltoid's great.  He rules.  You're a victim, has died!  See, look, I'm in.  I love this.  Fire the club.  Great.  Yep.  But it really is a...  It's a fucking...  It's just...  It's a cinematic masterpiece. 
[01:22:00]  Camera...  It's fucking a great movie.  I don't even know if I like Stanley Kubrick, to be completely honest with you.  Because that full metal jacket, the first half is amazing.  Then the second half becomes a completely different movie.  That one they finished up for him, that AI, was just way too creepy for me.  I hated that.  His fucking directing is great, though, man.  Yeah, yeah, absolutely.  Camera work is...  Absolutely.  The Shining, he did it.  He made The Shining scarier than the Shining King.  So now I'm back in with the Stanley Kubrick.  I love the show.  He did Pass to Glory, which is very good. 
[01:22:30]  I saw all that.  Old...  I think that was a...  I want to say a Kirk Douglas movie.  He did a bunch of...  A Lolita, the original Lolita.  He did a lot of good stuff.  He would take fucking forever to get focus.  To get the fucking frame in focus exactly the way he wanted it.  Just took forever.  Lighting, shit like that.  And you could just tell when you watch it.  Everything is just the clean lines.  Yeah.  The long shots.  You know, that bathroom scene in The Shining, very similar to the bathroom scene in Full Metal 
[01:23:00]  Jacket.  You know, that same stark kind of very long shot.  The long haul.  He always had the long shots, like just zooming in and zooming out.  Yeah, yeah.  He was just great, man.  And to hold focus like that, because it was always crystal fucking clear.  That's why he did so many takes.  If someone's out of focus, he'd fucking go...  He'd freak out.  How great to see when they're sitting there and Dim goes...  And he fucking slaps his leg with the fucking cane. 
[01:23:30]  Yeah.  Dim.  Yeah.  So great.  And all Pete says is right.  Right.  Right.  He probably couldn't even get a SAG card after that movie.  Yeah, you were in it, but you didn't say anything.  Yeah, you didn't do anything.  So, awesome so far.  Great.  I'll watch the second half today.  Talking about movies quickly.  I was watching Band of Brothers.  I finished up the last two episodes last night.  And then I got the new box set with, like, the Blu-ray features and stuff. 
[01:24:00]  So it's like picture-in-picture commentary.  And I watched the documentary on the real Easy Company guys.  So you got the old soldiers with, you know, one leg.  And they're hobbling back to Normandy and shit.  And they're in the Ardennes.  And it's, like, really, really cool.  You know?  And then I get to the part where the actors kind of â€“ Ron Livingston did this video documentary thing. 
[01:24:30]  Right.  They had him have a camera.  Oh, like a diary?  And he did, like, a video diary.  A video diary kind of?  Yeah, for the DVD, I gather.  And it â€“ I would recommend, if you enjoy the movie and the documentary and the whole thing, to not watch that part.  Why?  Because you just realize what douchebags actors are.  They're so fucking good in that movie in conveying who these people were. 
[01:25:00]  Believable.  Yeah, very believable.  You get so emotionally attached to these characters.  Wasn't Jimmy Fallon in Band of Brothers?  Yes, for two seconds.  And I'm not talking about him.  Why didn't he mention that?  We did at one point.  And he talked about how the Jeep wouldn't roll.  But did we mention that to him?  Yeah.  Oh, the first time he was on our show, we kind of beat him up about it.  Beat him up about it.  It's like, it took me right out of the movie for a second.  Thank God the movie's so good that I got back into it.  But the second he pulls up in the Jeep and goes, you need some ammo, guys? 
[01:25:30]  I'm like, it's Jimmy Fallon.  He's driving through the frigging Battle of the Bulge.  Stop.  Dude, it's Adam Sandler impression.  Yes.  So they have this video diary thing.  Right.  And apparently, in order to get the actors into this frame of mind of what it was like, they made them go through a 10-day boot camp. 
[01:26:00]  10 days.  Not very long for boot camp.  And it was run by that actor.  He's Dyer, is his name?  The guy that was in Lovely Fucking War in Platoon.  I know who you mean by those names.  He's in every war movie.  He actually runs a consulting company for movies.  Ah.  Yeah, and he was in Band of Brothers also, as a general.  And, like, he's running this thing.  And then they tell everybody that they're not to go by their regular names. 
[01:26:30]  Go by their character names.  If you have an English accent, which a lot of the actors did, cover it up.  Do the American accent.  Use words like yes.  Don't say yeah.  Don't say yo.  Don't say things like, you know, you're acting like you're in the 40s.  So they're going through this boot camp thing, and the actors just start, like, they'd be on camera for this documentary thing and going, like, you know, it really made us understand what these guys went through.  And I'm looking going, yeah, did it? 
[01:27:00]  As you ran off to fucking craft services to get food after, you know.  To get your latte?  Yeah, yeah.  When you went back to a warm place at night instead of.  Probably the Ritz-Carlton.  You know, these motherfuckers, two years on the front line, pretty much, after just training their asses off for months.  Living in ditches, kicking the rats off their bodies.  Friends' heads exploding next to them.  Yet, you know, it really gave us a feeling of what it was like to be a member of Easy Company in 1942. 
[01:27:30]  It's like, no, it didn't.  So you watch that part, and you're just like, some of these actors.  Some of them were cool.  They were like, you know, this isn't a piece of what these guys went through, and I'm just happy to be here to, like, pay tribute to these heroes that did this.  And that's cool.  Others, though.  You'd get a couple of other guys that, like.  Kind of make it about them.  You're fucking delusional, dude.  I was out in the rain for four hours. 
[01:28:00]  It really got me, like, in this mindset.  You hit physical and mental barriers that you have to persevere and burst through.  Coffee, please?  And it's so difficult.  And I'm watching this going, shut the fuck up.  I don't know, Ant.  They might have experienced the same thing.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I'm sure losing your leg in a fucking artillery barrage that lasted 40 days. 
[01:28:30]  I'm sure it's the same thing as not being able to, you know, get fresh shoelaces for your boots.  Or sell reception.  I'm with you.  Oh, it's just.  And then it's so weird to see, like, the guy that played Dick Winters.  Dick Winters?  Dick Winters.  Richard Winters.  Major Winters.  He's been in a few other movies.  He was in that Stephen King movie, Dreamcatcher, I think it was. 
[01:29:00]  I think he's a great actor.  And he played the part of Dick Winters fantastically.  It was great.  And then they show him during this documentary, and he's like, well, what I did was I came into this character thinking.  And you're like, this fucker's English?  I hate that.  He put on this accent where it was like, he was an American major.  That was him.  And they put on these accents. 
[01:29:30]  What the fuck happened?  You're American, goddammit.  Maybe he's American in character doing a British role.  No, he's British.  That always freaked me out.  What's his name from The Wire?  Was that an English dude?  That big black guy.  Oh, and you see a big black guy, and all of a sudden they're like a prison movie or something like that.  Like, out of B.C. is English.  Yeah.  Is he?  Yeah.  And then you hear him talk in an interview.  No, you're supposed to be.  What?  Because he had like a Jamaican accent in Oz. 
[01:30:00]  And then in The Wire, or in Lost, he had just like, yeah, Nigerian or something.  We got his English.  We got a lot of military guys checking in.  Basically, if you're accurate, and I'm sure you are, these guys spent 1% of the time the real soldiers did in boot camp.  Yeah.  1%.  And they didn't really have to go through the real training.  This wasn't any real fucking training.  These guys, you know why the insurance company, too, is getting all upset that a couple of the guys are getting hurt? 
[01:30:30]  They were getting like scratches on them and stuff.  So?  So it's like, you know, it wasn't like you were really going through these live fire training exercises and things like that.  A little neosporing.  Yeah.  And then get back in there.  And then you watch some of the behind-the-scenes footage of the video footage of the actual scenes.  Right.  And they look so bad.  It looks so cheap and cheesy, the sets and the explosions.  And then you watch it in the movie, and it's like, how the fuck do they do that? 
[01:31:00]  It looks real.  It looks amazing.  Cinemagic.  It is cinemagic.  Because they're in this little town that looks like it came from fucking Disney.  This little shitty fucking set that doesn't look real.  The explosions look so fake.  It's one quick take.  All right.  And cut.  Good job, guys.  And the debris doesn't look real.  And then when they show it in the movie, and the camera shakes, and the grit is on there.  And you see the guy's face as he hits the ground and shit like that. 
[01:31:30]  And you realize it's ten different shots put together.  And that explosion was a split second of the whole scene.  And they put it together.  It's amazing how they do that.  It's amazing how they make moves.  Yeah.  Well, you don't want to see enemies talking.  And clockwork.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  You don't want to see after the scene.  I don't want to see Malcolm McDowell talking to the bum they just kicked.  Right, right.  Yeah.  Hey, you want to grab some food?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Go to the commissary, eh?  Yeah, you don't want to see that.  No, no.  That's what it was. 
[01:32:00]  Which was weird, seeing the American soldiers in their uniform and the Nazi soldiers in their  uniform.  Just hanging out together.  And they're talking to the consultant about how this scene is supposed to go.  With their scripts in their hands.  Yeah, yeah.  They got their scripts and they're pointing at things.  And then, you know, they send them off in their different directions.  Show them playing a little hold'em.  Yeah.  And then they're just shooting at each other afterwards.  Yeah, you're right.  I hate that, too.  Yeah, it's kind of cool.  I like watching the movie Magic Shit.  It's just that pompous actor attitude that you realize that most of these actors are like 
[01:32:30]  that.  They're just this weird mindset in actors where they kind of have to try to either really  get into the role or believe that they're into this role.  So they actually believed that they had gone through enough training where...  And the reason they said they did this was so that when they were given direction to  look tired or to look like you're holding your weapon properly or look like you've just  run up a mountain with 80 pounds on your back, that way the actor could actually go back 
[01:33:00]  to the training and know what that felt like so he could actually act it out better, which  made sense.  But don't try to say you knew what it was like to have the training that these guys went  through.  So you know what it's like to go through enough training to where you know what 80 pounds  feels on your back all day so that when you're directed to move with a pack that doesn't have  80 pounds on it, you can make it look that way.  Right, right.  Yeah.  This is interesting. 
[01:33:30]  I do recommend the DVD.  The Blu-ray is great.  And they have picture-in-picture commentary during the show.  So if you've seen the whole thing and want to see it again with the commentary, it's pretty  interesting stuff.  I might have to go all in.  It's very re-watchable, man.  Very re-watchable.  I've only seen a little bit of it.  I've seen a couple episodes and I loved it.  It's fantastic.  I think I'm going to have to start from the beginning.  Yeah.  Really good.  I got to feel like the first or second, God, you've got to know how to wear cleavage. 
[01:34:00]  Sorry.  I know we're...  No, no.  We were the most easily distracted show ever since there were tits on the camera.  I'm a fan of the cleavage, but there's so many women out there, they don't know how  to wear it.  It looks just like...  You can't have a big divot.  No.  You can't have divot cleavage.  Looks like someone took a fucking stroke behind the ball.  It has to have a firmness to it and sort of a roundness to it.  It needs a roundness cushy.  If it started looking a little too like straight lines or flat... 
[01:34:30]  Yeah, flat.  Not flat, like flat lines.  Yeah.  Because we're talking about the cleavage.  You've got to get the right bra, too, to push that shit in there.  Right.  Because you can't have the big upside down V.  Yeah.  The upside down V cleavage ain't working.  Right.  Did you...  You guys don't watch East...  East...  Down and Down?  East Bound and Down.  Thank you.  They had the season finale.  Speaking of boobs, they had stunt boobs.  They hired some actress just to show her boobs. 
[01:35:00]  There's a scene where good old Danny McBride, our friend, Kenny Powers,  he is going to have sex in a car with his ex.  And they're building it up like, are you ready for this?  And he takes her shirt off.  And now you're looking at a pretty nice set in a bra, right?  Are you ready?  And he's like, oh, yeah, I'm ready.  And then they do a close-up and they obviously switch out the actress  and put in stunt boobs.  Oh, shit, yeah.  Now you're looking at these massive, over-the-top boobs 
[01:35:30]  that are, like, just struggling to stay in the bra.  And then she removes her bra and just, whoa.  The nice chick-kung chick-kung.  And I would love to get Danny McBride on the phone to ask him,  did they do that on purpose?  Because it was so obvious they switched out the boobs.  Or do they want you to think it was the same woman?  Yeah, maybe it was like a gag.  And then I'm laughing because, like, some woman in Hollywood, that's her claim to fame.  Body doubles, yeah, they use them a lot.  You'll never see her face. 
[01:36:00]  She just has the amazing boobs that is used in some of these productions.  Yeah, ass stand-ins, full-body stand-ins.  Right, right.  But she, and you know what?  If you can find it, I'm sure it's, oh, no, YouTube doesn't really show the nudity.  No, they didn't.  If you can find that scene, it's hilarious because it's so obvious they did the old switcheroo.  The old switcheroo.  Yeah, I hate the old switcheroo.  But Jamie Lee Curtis, what was that movie with Schwarzenegger?  True Lies.  True Lies.  She had a really, that body double, I think, was Jay Moore's first wife. 
[01:36:30]  Are you kidding?  Yeah, his first wife.  I thought that was her.  Nicole, no.  Yeah, the truth.  True Lies.  Jay Moore's first wife was the one in True Lies?  Nicole, yeah, I believe so.  Which scene, when it's all, like, shadowy so you can't tell it's really her?  Yes, I believe, Jay will be able to confirm that I think that's her body.  For real?  Yeah.  I thought it was Jamie Lee Curtis.  No.  Well, because she got pretty nude in that movie.  She still was showing a lot.  Yeah?  But, I mean, maybe for the leg and back show.  I don't remember.  They showed everything.  No kidding, man.  I think you learn a little something on this show every day. 
[01:37:00]  Well.  People want us to bring back Line of the Day, by the way.  What do you think?  Line of the Day.  Yeah, why don't we put it down for six months?  Line of the Day.  And I liked the, what did we learn?  We rested it, so we got to figure that shit out.  We did both.  Hey, we got an update on those DJs in Des Moines.  What happened?  Remember the yelling and screaming over the commercials?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, the guy was fucking worth playing again.  He was yelling at another on-air guy, and he was dropping the F-bomb like crazy during commercials.  Yeah, the commercials were playing. 
[01:37:30]  They had no idea there was a live mic on.  It sounded a little bit like this.  And we'll give you the update in a minute or two here.

I'm pretty happy we try to keep it real, and if there's some kind of problem, we bring it to the air for the most part.  You know, we've had a bunch of little exchanges over the years. 
[01:38:30]  Yeah, you're not going to hear a cover-up.  But these guys, it continues, and then they go on the air like nothing's going on.  Now at the Home Depot, carpet installation is just $139.

[01:39:30]  Sports is the official language of Des Moines Sports Station 1460 KXNO.  I've got to...  All right.  Good morning, Central Iowa.  Hope your brackets look a heck of a lot better than mine do. 
[01:40:00]  Kenny Miller is in studio.  I am John Miller.  Marty Terrell will be in shortly in 10.  I went 11-5 yesterday.  I got walloped.  Uh, what?  They're just talking to me.  Hey, I got walloped.  You're a fucking asshole.  Walloped with your picks or...  Unbelievable.  Well, here's your update.  What happened?  Three suspensions at radio station KXNO after F-bomb incident.  All right. 
[01:40:30]  Let me tell...  Let me guess.  The guy that was yelling all the F-bombs.  Mm-hmm.  The other guy he was yelling at.  Mm-hmm.  And the...  Board op.  Board op producer.  That's a good...  Yeah, because, uh, national sports talk shows replaced two regularly scheduled local programs  Monday as station officials dealt with a profane on-air incident Friday involving broadcasters  Marty Terrell and Larry Kotler.  Uh, an executive for Clear Channel.  Uh-oh.  Confirmed that three employees at the station have been suspended until further notice. 
[01:41:00]  Sensitivity training or something.  She declined to name the individuals in an email response to a listener.  Uh-oh.  Mm-hmm.  Uh-oh.  They're erasing the history of these guys.  And you are erased.  Uh-oh.  Listeners of the sports station heard a profane argument Friday morning between Terrell and  Kotler that included Terrell's use of the F-word at least a dozen times.  Uh, Joel McRae, senior vice president, issued an apology to listeners later Monday.  Waddle doodle.  You want to hear this apology? 
[01:41:30]  Yeah, let's hear this fucking bullshit apology.  We regret...  Yeah.  We deeply regret.  If people were offended, we here at, never want to, blah, blah, blah, shut it.  Those of you...  Blah, blah, blah, blah.  Right.  A private conversation between two KXNO employees inadvertently found its way on the air.  Found its way.  McRae said in the statement, KXNO radio apologizes to anyone who was offended by the content aired  during this accidental broadcast. 
[01:42:00]  So out of touch.  Most interesting thing that happened is central Iowa.  Who was offended by that?  That's like, wow, I'm finally hearing something cool.  Maybe a couple dummies, but stop catering to the couple of dummies out there.  What is it, a sports show?  Yeah.  So it's a bunch of guys anyway.  Well, who's offended?  They turn it up and go, holy shit, are you listening to this?  They're quarreling.  Yeah, listen, they're dropping the fuck bomb.  Let's see.  McRae said the incident remains under review.  Review?  By KXNO officials. 
[01:42:30]  Yeah, we'll get you right back on the air.  But that company policy forbids additional comment about the employees involved.  A commission's spokeswoman said an FCC investigation would begin only after a complaint is filed.  Yeah, that's good.  Let everyone know.  Yeah, so now, you know.  These guys are so fired, by the way.  The only reason they're not fired yet, we've been through this.  They want to see who else they can fire.  Right.  That's it.  That's how it works.  It's like, okay, they're in their big corporate offices going, okay, obviously these two are fired because they did it.  Yeah.  Who turned the mic on? 
[01:43:00]  Oh, he did?  Okay, he's fired.  Did the producer know they were doing this bit?  They're going to go right down the line.  You've got to find out if anybody else knew the mic was on and didn't shut it off.  Right, all that stuff.  Did anyone else look at the board?  Who was around the board when that happened?  Was the light on?  And the firing is always on a Friday because then it's buried in the papers.  We know this gig.  By the way, in all your years of radio, can you think of a worse time to have had this happen as a DJ?  Like, with the way the clock on the radio is?  Oh, I know. 
[01:43:30]  Oh, God.  Do you want to just be a good boy?  Oh, shit.  This is what's amazing.  Okay.  Sorry.  Rob Schneider.  What is he doing?  He's insane.  He's running around.  Oh, my God.  He doesn't know where to go.  Oh, the camera's chasing him around the news set.  Live on local TV here in New York.  Oh, my God.  Where do you think he's going to show up, Jimmy?  I don't know.  But he's running around backstage and they're following him.  Running all over the hallways. 
[01:44:00]  Creating havoc wherever he goes.  I hope he finds an elevator shaft.  Catch me if you can.  Attaboy.  Attaboy.  Boo.  That's how the audience reacts to your movies.  Boo.  He's got to have pictures of Adam Sandler with George Webber.  That's the only thing I can figure out.  Why does it continue? 
[01:44:30]  Every movie, you got to throw your buddy in it.  I get it.  Hey, you want to know what the argument was about?  Yeah.  Let me guess.  I heard Hall of Fame and credentials.  Credentials.  I'm guessing that one of them gave their credentials to somebody else or one of them didn't share  their credentials to honor.  Well, it's obvious it was over credentials.  But what kind of credentials is what I'm getting at here.  I mean, it had to be important credentials.  Yeah.  Maybe Obama was coming to town and this guy messed up.  Obama?  Messed up the credentials.  On-field credentials for a baseball game. 
[01:45:00]  All right.  For who?  I'm going to guess Roy all of a sudden somebody.  Well, Jimmy, last week's argument, apparently over media credentials, used during the recent  Iowa high school boys basketball tournament.  Are you shitting me?  They're going to lose their jobs over yelling about credentials to a high school basketball  game.  Can you just walk into those?  Pretty much.  Yes.  It took place just moments before the beginning of an NCAA basketball preview show. 
[01:45:30]  So they were talking about college basketball, right?  Good luck.  But this was credentials over a high school state boys basketball tournament.  Good luck, bros.  Oh, they're in deep trouble.  They're in Dutch.  They're in your mom's box territory.  They're so done.  No, they don't even get the chance to say that.  No.  They're fired.  It's obvious.  Suspended for now.  But it always starts with a suspension because you have to do the proper, you know, paperwork  and you've got to kind of go through this.  That statement. 
[01:46:00]  What?  We here at have decided that that type of language has no place in blah, blah, blah.  So we have blah, blah, blah.  We'll be immediately.  Immediately.  Right.  Yes.  Hey, I got a thank you to Jay in Canada.  Eastbound and down body double tits.  G-I-F.  A little jif.  That's always good.  I need Danny to kind of throw it up on the big screen for everybody.  The jif.  Why don't we take a break and we'll...  I might have to shit up. 
[01:46:30]  All right.  I feel something percolating.  You better tweet that shit.  I really do.  I feel it.  Gurgling?  I might have to shit.  I was so embarrassed because my fucking...  My girlfriend was working yesterday and I thought she was coming back at like 6.15  and I was farting up a storm in my room.  Oh, no.  And at 5.30 she came back 45 minutes early.  The whole room stunk.  Fucking whole apartment reeked like my farts.  She's like, you've been farting?  I'm like, I guess. 
[01:47:00]  Oh, I guess.  I'm so embarrassed.  Oh, Jimmy.  What are you doing?  I don't know.  Because then our favorite position is to lie on my stomach and prop my hips up with four  pillows.  And then she licks my balls and smells my ass and makes anteater noises.  That's what we do in bed.  What is that like?  I'm like, come on, baby.  Let's do the aardvark. 
[01:47:30]  And then she'll grab my ball bag skin at her teeth and just hold it and smell my ass.  Really?  Yeah.  Interesting.  Nice.  That's terrific, Jimmy.  Wow.  I hope it works out for you.  Sucks after farting.  Because you have fart residue on your cheeks.  Yeah, you don't want that.  I think we're going to see the picture before we go to bed.  Oh, okay.  Hey, also, I'm...  Oh.  Oh, nice tits.  Yeah.  Wow.  Those are some stuff.  Those are fake.  Those are obviously fake.  What's your first clue? 
[01:48:00]  Yeah.  Look at the bra mark, because they really want to squeeze those...  Yeah, yeah.  They're round.  They're perfectly round.  Yeah.  The actress doesn't...  She has nice boobs, but not that nice.  I suckle boobs.  They did the old switcheroo.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  Do we have the other shot of the chick before she takes the bra off?  All right.  No big deal.  No big look.  Anthony, Facebook, they got a group that started up.  It's called I Heart Jews. 
[01:48:30]  Ah.  The story next.  Nice.  Oh, wow, wow, wow, wow.  Open Anthony.  Jimmy, it might be a while.  He was struggling in that bathroom.  Oh, was he?  Oh, poor little feller.  I walked in.  I went, you who?  He goes, it's me.  I'm like, ugh.  So I had a stall buffer, because you never know what's going to happen if you go into the  stall right next to Jimmy.  No, you can't.  The sights, the sounds, the smells.  He does horrific things.  And then we're just talking about boxing and stuff, and then he's like, oh, I'm having  a problem in my yard. 
[01:49:00]  You were talking on the bowl?  Ah, yeah.  With each other?  Eh, why not?  I don't like bowl talk.  That echoey talk.  Yeah.  And then you just make believe that no one's hearing the noises you're making.  The worst is when you hear that echoey talk, but you're on the phone with somebody, and  then you're like, are you in the bathroom?  You're like, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I've been on the phone with, like, the bosses or something like that, and I'm taking, like, 
[01:49:30]  a leak, and I want to flush, so I get right by the door in get-ready position, and I flush  and I run out of the bathroom, because I don't want him to feel like he's talking to me  if he's taking piss or shit.  Well, it depends on which boss.  Yeah, true.  Some bosses get the full, like, pee hit in the water.  They get the speaker phone while you're taking the dump, with the phone right between your  legs.  Oh, yeah.  And if you're one of those suits, that means I don't respect you, so you figure it out. 
[01:50:00]  Opie and Anthony, Kurt Schilling retires with no regrets after 23 seasons and three World  Series titles.  Ooh.  So long to Kurt.  See ya.  23 seasons?  Good.  Goodbye.  That's not true.  23 seasons?  Now he can devote his whole life to EverQuest.  Is he an EverQuest guy?  Yeah, he was years ago.  Oh, really?  I don't know what he does now.  Yeah.  Another Man is Pregnant.  Oh, wow. 
[01:50:30]  What a wacky story.  That's why Jimmy has to be in here.  He writes about the man that got pregnant in his latest book.  Yeah.  He's not a fan of the man getting pregnant thing.  Well, I wouldn't be either, because it's not a man.  Thank you, Anthony.  Exactly.  Exactly.  And where's our McLovin audio from yesterday?  Because remember we had that crazy bitch come in?  Oh, yes.  I shouldn't call her a bitch.  It was really cool.  What was her name?  Jill?  Liz?  Liz.  Why am I saying Jill? 
[01:51:00]  Maybe.  What's up, Dan?  What are you doing?  Ooh.  No, that was...  Wow, that came out of nowhere.  Liz.  Liz.  And I wasn't calling it...  Oh, whatever.  I was getting in stupid trouble.  It was just a name I pulled out of my head, I swear.  Pulled out of a hat.  Don't look too much into it.  McLovin drops an F-bomb on Jimmy Kimmel.  We were going to play this yesterday, but then Liz. 
[01:51:30]  Yeah.  Man, she rocked.  She was cool.  We didn't really know what to do with her.  Well, yeah, she kind of just came in.  I mean, Jimmy, of course, invited her in, said, come on in.  Yeah.  She came in.  Yeah.  And within a minute, not even under a minute of talking to her, I just was looking and saying,  oh, my God, shithouse rat crazy.  Yeah.  And she didn't disappoint.  Nope.  She was a little kooky.  Yep.  A good egg. 
[01:52:00]  Yes.  She wound up taking her clothing off.  Uh-huh.  Exposing very nice body.  She could be a boob body double in Hollywood.  That was good.  Yeah, yeah.  A stunt boob.  Yeah, sure, sure.  She could do some stunt boobing.  Sure.  So, anyway, so we blew off everything else we were doing yesterday, so we're a little behind.  We got McLovin dropping an F-bomb on Jimmy Kimmel.  I'm noticing this is happening more and more, and no one gives a crap.  Yep.  They're getting attention that way.  The federal government's a little busy right now with the economy, so they're not... 
[01:52:30]  If the federal government spends any real amount of time doing anything else right now,  they get...  The people get mad.  Right.  It's like, oh, why are you going after this?  They're making a big fuss about this, the F-bomb being dropped, that...  They're like, we're going broke here.  Right.  So they leave it alone now.  That's where we're at, so you'll see the F-bomb more.  I'm distracted, because this Rob Schneider is just terrific.  They're showing a scene from his latest movie. 
[01:53:00]  He seems to have nunchucks on...  Soap on a rope in a shower.  Well, I guess it's some kind of prison film?  Some guy's trying to...  Like a gang...  They were trying to rape him, maybe, in the shower?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Now he's beating a white supremacist up with...  With his homemade...  That's so...  ...weapon.  ...on a rope chucks.  And, um...  Oh, my God.  Well, that's not the audio.  No, you got the other one.  It's never the odd one.  It's never the right television.  It's a 50-50 shot, isn't it? 
[01:53:30]  We lose every time.  And it's never the right one.  Because then it would have been good, because then they go to live Rob Schneider,  and I'm sure he's going to be just hilarious, and we should have it on our show.  That should be hilarious.  Look, he's so cool that he just kind of hangs out with his coffee on set, man.  Yeah.  With his hat on backwards.  Backwards.  That's cool.  Ugh.  All right.  Here's McLovin.  Shoot, he came up to me, and he just stared me in the eyes and just said,  Your speech was fucking hilarious. 
[01:54:00]  Turned away and just walked away.  Wow.  That's it.  If you can make Harrison Ford use profanity...  I've made it.  ...really made an impression on the man.  Really.  And that was just on TV and no one cared?  That show live?  No, it's not live.  Jimmy Kimmel.  Kimmel's live.  That's live?  Jimmy Kimmel's live.  Jimmy Kimmel's live, right.  Oh, well, that's the whole gimmick of the show, right.  That's live.  Oh, okay.  I would wonder why, yeah.  But there'll be no problems.  But those DJs in Des Moines?  No.  So fired.  No one on Jimmy Kimmel will get fired for the F-bomb on live TV. 
[01:54:30]  What the hell is McLovin kid there thinking?  Jimmy.  Don't they...  It was a doozy, huh?  Don't they prompt them beforehand that it's a live show and watch your language?  Or they...  Even though it's live, they have a little safety.  They could have...  They have a delay or something, you think?  Jimmy, you're missing Rob Schneider.  He's promoting his new movie.  What's the movie?  It's called Rob Schneider's Latest Hunk of Shit.  Oh, is that what it's called?  You got the one on my Jimmy.  Oh.  Ah, ha, ha.  I was wondering why I couldn't hear you. 
[01:55:00]  I'm talking to this one.  Okay.  Ooh, that was a dump.  Was it at Lulu?  It was...  But it's hard because I've been eating oatmeal and egg whites every morning.  So my duties aren't as regular as they should be.  Why?  That oatmeal pushes it through.  No, oatmeal makes it hard for me.  It's like cement.  Oh, God.  You're not eating the right oatmeal.  I am.  No, you're eating stuff that looks like...  Yeah?  Was it one of those?  Wallpaper glue.  I feel like a fucking...  Oh, boy.  He knows, right?  I'm telling you.  Uh-oh.  What's the matter?  You itching? 
[01:55:30]  Just checking.  No, no.  I'm not itching.  But I feel like a drop of something on the back, but it's fine now.  Ugh.  I want to make sure it wasn't shit splashed.  A little moisture?  Yeah.  There's nothing worse.  No, there is.  After a night at Guinness, where it's just like fucking...  I don't know what it is.  It's like tar.  It just makes marks on the bottom of the toilet.  That's just...  Yeah.  You've got to scrub them with a fucking car buffer.  Last week at the Patty's Day game, I took a dump.  It was...  It reminded me of one of those t-shirt guns, like they do at the baseball games, because 
[01:56:00]  it was solid.  But then behind it was just compressed air.  And it just...  Like, when I tell you that it fired...  It fired into the toilet.  It wasn't just shit coming out.  It was launched into the toilet.  Like a depth charge.  Shooting shitty shirts into the...  Oh, is that great?  That's classic.  You should act the gig?  I had to.  I had to.  That's a must shit. 
[01:56:30]  Yeah, if you shit in a bar on St. Patty's Day, you really have to shit.  You can't hold it.  But, you know, I went downstairs because no one was there.  Everybody was hanging out upstairs.  Yeah, yeah.  When I walked out, there was no one in there.  Went to the secret bathroom downstairs.  It was awesome.  I hate shitting in public.  I want to be naked in my own bedroom.  You like being naked when you shit?  Who doesn't?  I want to be naked with socks on.  I shit with socks on.  Naked with socks on?  No.  I kind of need the feeling of pants around the old ankles.  Socks on at least.  No, no. 
[01:57:00]  Shirt on, definitely.  I shit the dark, John.  No, I...  Shit.  I do.  I shut the lights off.  Bat.  You shut the lights off?  Guano coming out of Jimmy.  Guano.  I'm shitting.  Yeah, I like to be fucking naked in the dark when I shit.  I'll have...  I have a red light in my bathroom and a regular light.  Wow.  It's cool for showering with a chick when you have a red light.  Oh, look at you.  You're always thinking how you can look a little better.  Yeah, exactly. 
[01:57:30]  So I have a blindfold on.  I hand a girl and she comes in.  And I have a fucking bigger dick prosthetic I put on.  Fucking size queen whore I'm dating.  So you have a red light in there.  Yeah, over the shower.  There's a light.  So I don't need a bright light.  I shower the lights off and that red light.  It's such a cool, relaxing vibe.  It's like being in a red light place.  In a dark room.  And I shit with that on sometimes.  Yeah.  It's wonderful.  I'm...  Lights on.  Fucking...  I turn the TV on sometimes if I know I'll be there a while. 
[01:58:00]  Turn the old TV and the shitter on.  Or then I'll just, like I said, trade stocks or tweet.  I gotta always bring the iPhone into the bathroom.  There's plenty to choose from.  That's what I like.  A magazine.  American Rifleman's on the toilet tank.  I can pull that.  Yeah, you need it.  You got your options.  The latest fucking rifles that are out.  You know, you need the options now.  Good old options.  It's 2009.  A lot of various forms of entertainment, even on the shitter.  Hey, we got Jim Gaffigan coming in. 
[01:58:30]  Yeah.  Very funny Jim Gaffigan.  We haven't had him on the show in a while.  And Kurt Angle.  Yeah.  He hasn't been on in years.  Okay.  We used to...  Really?  That long?  We used to do a lot with Kurt Angle at WNEW.  I do remember that.  He hasn't been on since then.  I don't know if I've ever met him.  I don't know if I've ever met him.  2000, Iraq just told me.  It was last time.  We haven't seen him in nine years.  Was Iraq just yelling his weight out?  Or was that...  His arms.  His arms.  I thought that wasn't boo. 
[01:59:00]  He just went boo in my ear.  Yeah.  Iraq, that was an easy one though.  You can handle that.  Yeah.  Come on.  Yeah.  Come on.  Swat that shit away.  Exactly.  Hey, I don't know what to do with this yet, but it's coming to everyone's attention that  we got a little BFF blooming among us.  Yes.  There is a friendship.  Danny has noticed.  Sam has noticed.  Blossoming here.  Mars, I think he has noticed.  In our studios.  A great friendship. 
[01:59:30]  A BFF.  Yeah.  And you're going to be surprised that who has a BFF.  Mm-hmm.  Iraq and his shoes.  I should have done something better with that.  Sorry, Eric.  I don't know what we could do with this, but I think these two need to make a buddy film.  I think these two would be perfect for a buddy film.  Yep, I do, too.  Do you know who I'm talking about?  I certainly do.  That would be good.  Two ex-cops.  Club Soda Kenny.  Yes.  Has found a friend.  Yep.  And we've been around Club Soda Kenny.  My friend.  My friend. 
[02:00:00]  It's my kid.  It's beautiful.  And it's nothing but like, oh, jeez.  My friend.  Oh.  Oh.  So, who did you hit your perps with?  Yeah.  What did you hit him?  What?  Who did you hit your perps with?  Am I an idiot?  Oh, whatever.  It still is funny.  They're two ex-detectives.  Oh, I didn't know Joe was a detective.  I believe so.  Well, he was on the job, and they have... 
[02:00:30]  Really?  They got a blossoming friendship going.  Don't bring him in yet.  Okay.  He's a jockey.  No, don't bring him in yet, because I want some of the stories on the air.  What happened?  Can you...  Anthony said something.  Oh, my God.  What did I miss?  No, it wasn't bad.  Oh, no.  It was sweet.  I will say this.  I did not realize Joe was an ex-cop.  Yeah.  Well, Master Joe, who took over for Master Joe.  Master Joe.  I love that they call him Master Joe.  Master Joe.  He's a great guy.  Loves the show. 
[02:01:00]  Him and Kenny have so hit it off.  Yeah.  And we're all noticing.  So now I want the staff to come in with their Club Soda Kenny and Master Joe observations.  What they've seen to make everybody know, not think, know that there is just a blossoming  friendship here.  Yeah.  I don't know where this is going, but there's something here.  I want them to do a video where they're singing, you say tomato, I say tomato.  Let's haul the whole thing off. 
[02:01:30]  And they both just step in front of a dump truck.  Two zilches.  We could start with that.  Danny, what have you observed?  I hear after the show, I'm not here.  I've seen this myself.  They kind of sit on the bleachers together.  Yeah.  Let's exchange stories in between our show and Ron and Fez because there's a bit of a  downtime.  Yeah.  And Master Joe is obviously here through Ron and Fez and Kenny has to stay as well.  And so they buddy up and they have little hangout sessions every day. 
[02:02:00]  They're like Abbott and Costello.  They really are.  Yeah.  Kenny's a lot taller than Master Joe.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Kenny's what, 6'5"?  Oh, what does Sam have something?  Of course Sam's got something.  Sam's just like twins with Arnold Schwarzenegger.  Danny D'Avino.  Danny D'Avino.  Well, the visual is perfect because when they're out there, like they're monitoring  the live crowd and everything.  Yeah.  And they stand together, but Kenny sits down. 
[02:02:30]  Yeah.  And Joe stands up next to him.  Yeah.  And they stay there.  So it's like, even though Kenny's taller, he sits down because he doesn't want to, you  know.  And then they're the same size.  Yeah.  They could carry on a conversation with each other like that.  Yeah.  What have you noticed, though?  Well, they're joined at the hip at this point.  They really are, right?  Yeah.  Like, it's not just after the show.  Like, they do things together.  I've never seen Kenny friendly with anybody.  No.  Kenny likes Joe, too, on the way up to Albany.  He's going to tell me Joe is the next cop. 
[02:03:00]  Yeah.  He likes Joe.  Yeah.  And he doesn't have any kind words about anybody.  You're right.  He's been sending, like, the interns out and staying to get food, which is fine.  Mm-hmm.  But he used to just have to go out himself.  But now that he's got something to keep him company here, he likes his time with  that.  Oh, it's so happy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hey, Ken, what kind of you use? 
[02:03:30]  Where'd you buy your?  You don't have any.  Sam, you're a fan of the bromance.  Is there a bromance among us?  This is a bromance.  Really?  If anybody was wondering what is a bromance, Kenny and Joe is a bromance.  This is it.  How do we do this?  Should we bring Kenny in?  Should we bring him?  Joe.  I should definitely talk to Joe.  We haven't talked.  He's a really nice dude.  Right.  He doesn't.  But he's a short dude.  You know.  And, you know, very squat.  He's probably a very, very strong guy.  Right.  He's probably a major problem. 
[02:04:00]  Oh, yeah.  I would assume.  Because he has a low center of gravity and he'll probably fucking, he'll probably hip  check you into a fucking brick wall.  Rob in New York has a Master Joe story.  He must have saw the show live.  Rob, what do you got on Master Joe?  What's up, buddy?  Hey.  Jimmy, you're Al Pacino's the best.  Oh.  I went to see Rod and Fez.  You're out of order.  Would you compliment somebody and they just overdo it and don't do it well?  You're on or I'm not out of order.  All right.  Go ahead.  Sorry.  I went to see Rod and Fez back in November and I guess when Master Joe first started 
[02:04:30]  and he was going to our stuff, he was in a suit, he was all professional, he was very  rigid, like, you're not going to hurt me, buddy, are you?  Yeah.  And then I went to see the show yesterday and he opened the door and was like, hey, buddy,  you got gifts?  Hey, how you been?  Come on.  Come on in and just look around.  Cool.  No!  John in Denver wants to know if they share a smoothie with two straws.  They actually share a toothbrush. 
[02:05:00]  It's creepy.  Kenny keeps it in his back pocket.  If we bring Kenny in here, it's going to be just...  I mean, should we bring him in?  Yeah, Kenny's excited about this.  We should see how much they know each other.  Like, you know, what was that old game show?  Newlywed or something?  Yeah, yeah.  The Newlywed game.  Newlywed game.  Which race would Kenny rather plummet?  Plummet.  Can we do a version?  Yeah, we do.  Can we get these out?  We stink.  We'll figure it out.  Can we do that?  How do they do that?  Newlywed style it? 
[02:05:30]  Yeah.  You want to go old school?  Yeah.  You just ask questions of the other person.  Yeah, and then they'll have to hold up the card.  And see how much they know, yeah.  And write the card.  Yeah.  Can we do that today?  They're unlike Newlyweds.  Yeah, I mean, if we can...  We should get Kenny in, dude.  Yeah, Kenny.  Let's get Kenny in here for a second.  Kenny.  Oh, here comes the blushing bride.  Kenny.  Jesus, Kenny.  Have you found a friend?  Be honest.  Yeah, but we've got to keep Joe on the DL.  Why? 
[02:06:00]  Because Sirius has very strict company rules and policies about how certain employees have  to act.  And he's a security officer.  He's not on-air talent.  Oh, wow.  Well, we can still talk to him, right?  No, he's not allowed on-air.  Oh, my God.  Why have fun?  We've got a great bit that we can do.  For real?  And the reason why I can't get your food anymore is now that Sirius is in control, I'm not  allowed to leave, you know, because I'm security. 
[02:06:30]  I'm not, you know...  Right.  That's fair.  I understand that, but...  A talent handler or anything like that.  Yeah.  But I don't know why we can't get Joe on and ask him, like, real questions.  I think the company got to Kenny.  Do you have a scar on your head anywhere?  I don't know.  Not yet.  Did he get to your brain?  Where they put a brain in?  Exactly.  It's like a peasant's pest.  He just opens his mouth and will fall out.  Yeah, he's the only one that they actually add brain matter to.  Oh, well, there goes the bit.  Just make believe we weren't saying anything.  Yeah.  Forget what you just heard.  That's too bad.  For 10 minutes. 
[02:07:00]  We had something that was developing into a fine bit.  Yeah.  Well, maybe we could...  How about this?  We could...  Maybe...  We could...  Could someone play the part of Master Joe?  Well, in another two weeks, maybe somebody can play the part of me, too.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  What does that mean?  I don't know if I'm in the transition plans to Rockefeller Center.  Oh, Jesus.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  I get it.  I get it.  I get it.  Take more things.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  We don't know that yet.  Let's not assume that.  No, I got it.  I understand how important he is to you guys. 
[02:07:30]  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  I get it.  I get it.  I get it.  I get it.  All right.  So this Kenny, the boot right in the ass.  Yeah.  Let's...  He got it.  He got it.  He got it.  All right.  Thanks, Kenny.  Yeah, we'll figure it out.  Thanks, Kenny.  You guys are so talented.  You can...  Oh, yeah.  We could broadcast from a fucking phone booth.  Yeah.  We will be, as a matter of fact.  Because it's good for the show, right?  All right.  Thank you.  Don't get me started because I'll just get myself in trouble.  I'm trying to be smarter.  People as smart as Kenny, they're telling us you have to go. 
[02:08:00]  Yeah.  Hey, Anthony, I was telling you about that Facebook.  There's a group that started up on Facebook.  I have not heard this yet.  Danny says it's pretty terrific.  So why don't we get right into the audio and we'll stop when we have to.  It's disgusting.  It's despicable.  Like, who would ever do that?  You can join all kinds of groups on Facebook.  This one was called I Heart Jews and at one point had more than 2,000 members.  But then the pride turned into pain as the image of Hitler took over.  Wendy Erdheim couldn't believe her eyes. 
[02:08:30]  I get a notice that says the name of the group, I Love Jews, has been changed to Hitler, the greatest man in history.  Group members reacted quickly with...  All right, look.  Look, they fell for a gag, I would gather.  Somebody came up with a little gag-a-rooney there.  A little Facebook gag.  A little, you know, very poor in taste.  Obviously.  But, wow.  Holy shit.  Especially the day of Hitler, the greatest man in history. 
[02:09:00]  In history.  So, the guy went through the time of the I Heart Jews.  He opens up the site, probably puts out a bunch of...  He had over 2,000 members.  2,000 members.  Knowing that he had a great punchline.  Knowing that the fucking turn, the heel turn was going to be classic.  Yeah.  Wow.  Let me hear that again.  Turned into pain as the image of Hitler took over.  Wendy Erdheim couldn't believe her eyes. 
[02:09:30]  I get a notice that says the name of the group, I Love Jews, has been changed to Hitler, the greatest man in history.  Group members reacted quickly with comments like, is this a joke?  Because if it's not, I am absolutely appalled.  And, this is not I Heart Jews.  It's not I Heart Jews.  No, it's not.  Yeah.  I'm pissed off because I went from Hitler, the greatest man in history.  And then one day I logged on and it was I Heart Jews.  And I didn't know who to complain to.  Everybody's confused.  Yeah. 
[02:10:00]  I like to almost say, is this a joke?  No, ma'am, it's not.  It's an actual...  He was actually hoping the group would go with it.  You dope.  It's a joke.  Just don't belong to the group.  You know, we like just changing the name every so often.  It's just some asshole online.  You know what it is.  Give me a break.  And then a little more to the story here.  I love this.  Mark Weitzman tracks internet hate groups for the Simon Wiesenthal Center and says this was no accident.  He believes...  This was no voting accident.  Whoopsie, what did I upload? 
[02:10:30]  Oh, an entire Hitler site.  Or a Jew site used to be.  Yeah, what was your first clue it wasn't an accident?  Oops.  Harry, the greatest man in history, and he misspelled it?  My Uncle Harry?  Uploaded the wrong pictures.  Yes.  Groups for the Simon Wiesenthal Center and says this was no accident.  He believes Facebook users were set up for an internet slap on the face.  Without bringing further knowledge of who the owners are, one would have to say that it's  premeditated and, you know, the intent was there from the beginning. 
[02:11:00]  It's up to the people involved, the ISPs, the service providers, as well as the users  to sort of keep an eye on this and to bring it to people's attention and to insist that something  be done to prevent it.  Hey, I know we're in the middle of this, but Channel 11, local news here in New York, they're  doing something called Chick Chat.  A bunch of news readers are attempting to do The View locally.  Yeah, yeah, that seems to be what it is.  You've got to get this audience to see if there's something. 
[02:11:30]  It has to be the worst psychobabble ever.  Rob Snyder.  And Rob Snyder's in the middle of it.  In the hole.  And what, are they just talking about MTA Fair Hike right now?  That's the subject of Chick Chat today.  Because people can't afford things as they are now.  My cunt itches.  My tits ache.  I'm worthless.  I'm a hole with teeth.  What do they...  Oh my God.  Has that always been there on her? 
[02:12:00]  With that mole?  Yeah.  Of course it has been.  I thought it was like, she could squeeze it.  Yeah, she headbutted Robert Redford in one of his things.  I thought, what is that shit?  One of those things.  They got like a weather...  The weather woman.  The weather bimbo.  They got the entertainment bimbo.  The other traffic girl, not Jill.  No.  They got the entertainment.  And they got like the anchor.  They're all news readers.  They don't have an opinion. 
[02:12:30]  And now it's AIG bonuses they're talking about on Chick Chat.  Get this audio.  And Rob Schneider is just, I'm sure, just adding in his unique brand of humor.  He has a backwards hat.  Yes, his hat's on backwards.  He's too cool to try to look good for TV, man.  That's what you do.  Oh my God.  This just looks so...  What?  They're trying to do something here.  Yeah.  Chick Chat.  It has to go up on there.  All right, hurry up, Mars. 
[02:13:00]  Who would they put on if it was called Chick Chat?  By the way, I want to make it perfectly known.  It's a little joke.  We want Mars to make the transition to the big building.  That's right.  I just want to make that perfectly clear to whoever the hell listens to us.  We...  No one.  No one!  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  Thank you.  Let's not do it now.  Right.  Let's deal with that next term. 
[02:13:30]  We got to deal with, yeah, the time and effort towards, like...  It's a job.  It's awesome.  You know, fixing up our roads, which are a disaster in California.  I used to like when I lived in New York, by the time you drive to Connecticut, you see  the roads.  Hey, the roads are better here.  Yes.  You're driving potholes everywhere.  Speaking about that, you want to talk about Octomom?  Octomom in California.  Yeah, okay.  What?  It's a big story for you guys out in the West Coast.  Speaking of that, speaking of roads, you got a twat that looked like the bad story.  Maybe it shouldn't be.  Potholes.  Speaking of potholes.  I guess it is. 
[02:14:00]  Eight little monsters roll out of the train.  But I think, you know what I think?  I think that doctor was...  I thought I said, well, that has to happen to Tijuana.  There is some...  That was a doctor in Beverly Hills when he did that.  He did kill her.  That guy should lose his license.  Well, there is some investigations going on with that doctor.  Five holes just going off.  Absolutely.  This is, he's creating, I mean, that's $150 million.  This has got eight babies that we're going to have to deal with tax-wise for the forever.  She's got no money.  We have to deal with her own love.  I was, like, disgusted with her. 
[02:14:30]  Well, again, her father did buy her the house.  Can we not see any more pictures of that belly anymore?  You're hearing this white noise.  This is so bad.  Okay, wait, let's move on.  At the Yankee Stadium, high-end food.  We all love baseball games.  What do you guys think about having...  Do we really all love baseball games, you ladies?  I love the Yankee games.  This one, too.  This one, too.  I go to Yankee games.  Just let that roll out there.  I go to Yankee.  I just like the hot dogs.  No.  It was simple.  Did you see the World Baseball Classic last night?  No, no.  I just like when a real Alamark bleeds on me.  You had one, right? 
[02:15:00]  It was fantastic.  I mean, that was better than the World Series, for example.  You were awesome.  Thank you so much for coming.  That's it?  That's it right there.  Whatever.  Whatever.  Yeah.  How much can you say Yankee stage?  The cast of Chicago.  All right, guys.  Don't forget that you, too, can get in on our chit-chat.  So SoundOff, just log on to our website, WPS.com.  Get in on the chit-chat.  I love that while they're chit-chatting, I like to take my dick out and just wave it at them.  Oh.  End of relief.  They stand up.  There's just five red spots on their chairs. 
[02:15:30]  Get the burgundy chairs for next time.  No more white seats.  They're all cranky.  Wow.  That fucking was horrendous.  Holy crap.  What did we just see?  What an awful new segment that whoever thought of should be fired for.  Chick-chat.  Chick-chat.  I'd rather listen to five turtles on seats do nothing but hang out.  They should just do that.  Have one dumb one just fall off the chair like you know it would.  Make soup out of it.  No, it's great. 
[02:16:00]  Fucking idiots.  It's Heather P. from Jersey.  Yesterday, Jill was outside jump roping during the chit-chat.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, apparently they've been throwing around on the street lately.  You know what?  But she would be perfect for that.  Yeah.  She knows how to carry on a conversation, not the rest of these dummies.  Yeah, they've got that entertainment girl.  I've got to say, chit-chat was a big bust.  Oh, thank God Rob Schneider was there to punch it up a little bit.  Oof.  Oof. 
[02:16:30]  Rob.  That was good.  Well, so apparently before that, that Jewish site there, there's a suspicion that it may  have been premeditated.  What?  Why can't they just say, obviously, somebody was making a joke?  We're all looking at you very suspiciously.  No, it wasn't me.  I must say.  All right.  I live among the Jews.  They are my neighbors, my brethren. 
[02:17:00]  I live among the tribe.  It's a great gag, though.  As they say.  I mean, it's wrong, obviously, but wow, that guy thought it out.  It was thought out.  It's very tasteless, but as far as practical jokes go, holy shit.  Yeah.  Holy shit-a-rooney.  I'm sure I got them.  Wow.  Give it a shit-a-rooney.  Yeah, holy shit-a-rooney.  That's a shit-a-rooney.  You can set people up very easily on that, I guess.  You put together a site that's going to get a bunch of people on there, under the guise 
[02:17:30]  that it's a sympathetic site, and then you turn it around and do something opposite.  You do the old flip.  What could you do?  You flip it.  What else could you do?  By the way, the octuplet mom, yeah, she is in the news because she fired her free nurses.  Yeah.  They were able to get her help where these nurses come to her house and pretty much raise the  kids for her, and this lunatic fired the free nurses.  Fire.  Yeah, fired them.  She's crazy. 
[02:18:00]  Yeah, absolutely.  She really is.  There's no...  Look, it's chik-chat.  We're doing chik-chat right here.  How's your vagina?  Mine hurts a little.  It's a little itchy.  Mine's puffy.  A bit itchy.  They're doing, like, SNL or something now, because, look, now they got, like, a...  Now they got some Chicago...  ...performance going on.  What happened to the news?  ...from Chicago.  Is there news?  Who the fuck is...  Who's producing the show?  George Webber?  Fucking awful.  Poor George Webber.  I know.  He just wanted a little cock.  Yeah, exactly. 
[02:18:30]  Oh, my God.  Did he need the cock?  It was obviously a violent struggle, too.  Wow.  I'm sure it's a national story, but he was loved in the radio world, I guess, because  it went to the New York radio message board.  Loved in other places, too.  Yeah.  And he had a lot of lovers in radio and outside radio.  He seemed to be the same attitude as if you watched Looking for Mr. Goodbar, where  you're just kind of out on the prowl, picking up guys.  Yeah.  What did he get?  Guys from the internet?  That's what they're saying.  Invite him over the house? 
[02:19:00]  Find Craigslist and shit.  Ooh.  Picked up a...  They're calling it a mandate.  Mandate.  And he was murdered in the worst way, man.  His feet was bound.  He was half nude.  They were stabbed in the head, chest, and neck area.  Yeah.  Blood all over the apartment.  He knew his attacker because of how the front door was locked and the back door was open,  like this guy left.  The back door was open, all right.  Wow.  Yeah.  It's a huge story here in New York.  Yeah.  And this guy was on the radio.  I think we got the latest on it. 
[02:19:30]  Did he play it off like he was straight?  Yeah.  We told people he had a girlfriend.  Maybe he did.  Oh, really?  He was the new guy.  You can't be this gay and really have a girlfriend.  No fucking way.  But he fucking, you know, who knows?  He might have met a hustler somewhere at a bar.  Hustler.  Who the fuck knows?  This story's sexy.  You gotta be so careful who you let in your apartment, man.  Yeah.  I got doormans.  Guys.  I got guys here.  No, but I mean, even a chick, you got a lot of chick who'd cut your throat, too.  They're fucking crazy bitches, too.  Just smack her across the room.  They like that. 
[02:20:00]  You want to hear the story?  Yeah.  Certainly do.  I'm George Weber with the stories you'll be talking about all day.  For years, we listened to WABC Radio's George Weber report the news.  Today, he was the news.  Found dead this morning inside his Carroll Gardens home, stabbed in the neck.  Nick Oliveri watched cops go in and out of his friend's apartment.  I couldn't imagine anybody doing something to him like that.  He was just a real good guy.  Cops were sent to Weber's apartment after he didn't show up for work.  The 50-year-old newsman joined ABC News Radio last year after working several years at 77 WABC's morning show with Curtis and Kuby. 
[02:20:30]  Cops tell us there were no visible signs of forced entry and no word yet if anything was stolen out of Weber's apartment.  The investigation is continuing, and so far, no arrests have been made.  Wow.  They'll get whoever it was.  That's much blood.  There was blood around the scene.  It was the attacker, too.  But if he was bound, how the fuck did he fight back?  He obviously did.  No, they said he did.  He had stabbed ones on his hands.  He probably fought back while he was trying to bind him.  Right, maybe.  Maybe that's it. 
[02:21:00]  Get him with a knife.  All right.  I saw some, because I watch all those goddamn FBI shows and the cold case files and stuff,  and there was one where this guy was just a fucking maniac kidnapping out of parking lots like pretty hot fucking girls,  anywhere from 16 to like 20 years old.  And then he'd take them and just rake the shit out of them repeatedly and murder them.  Just a real fucking, ugh. 
[02:21:30]  Then he takes, uh, he takes one girl, brings her into the woods, and this girl is begging, saying,  please just don't stab me.  Shoot me in the head.  And the motherfucker takes a knife and just stabs her in the chest twice and just leaves her there.  Pulls away.  Well, that's her fault.  And then realizes, oh, she just said, stab me instead?  No, please don't shoot me in the head.  Yeah, yeah, maybe that would have worked. 
[02:22:00]  You gotta like, you know.  Well, it actually worked out for her, because he pulled away.  You gotta know you're an attacker.  He pulled away, and then he's like, I better go back to see if I finish the job.  And he fucking backed up, went back in the woods.  She was gonzo.  Gone.  She fucking took off with two holes in her.  Wow.  Two stab wounds to the chest.  She made it to the hospital, gave a little description, all that shit, and they got the guy.  Who was he?  Did she die?  No.  She survived it.  No, she lived through that one.  Wow.  And they actually got the guy and gave him the death penalty.  He's fucking dead now. 
[02:22:30]  Good.  Yeah, good.  I watch, I'm fascinated with those stupid-ass shows.  I watch them all the time.  It's almost impossible to get away now.  I mean.  That's what it is.  You just see how amazing it is, how they find the littlest fucking thing, and it's the whole case.  But criminals shouldn't have to give DNA samples, because that's invasive, man.  Man, big brother, man.  The second, when you're fucking, when you are put in prison, they should take a blood sample, get the DNA, put it on file like they do fingerprints. 
[02:23:00]  What's the fucking difference?  What's the problem with ordinary citizens giving, like, if I would give DNA, I'm not a rapist.  I'm not a fucking child abducted.  For you, it would be something that would save you, in some cases.  If you're not going to fucking rape or murder somebody, and then someone accuses you of something, and there's DNA, you know, it's on record.  Go ahead. 
[02:23:30]  I can, it's not me.  I'd give it up in a second.  I'd give up DNA all the time.  Absolutely.  I'd give it up.  Check the trap in my shower.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  It's a stringy mess.  Oh, God damn.  Linguini just flying against the wall.  Just looks like a bunch of thread.  I blasted my girlfriend's fucking hairdo the other day.  Oh, a hairdo.  We were going out with Flo from fucking Palace. 
[02:24:00]  Her hairdo.  That's right.  She said, kiss my grits, and I put my grits in her hair.  No, I was, I'm doing some period fucking now.  I'd never done it before.  Now, I can't stop.  Bravo, because it's fantastic.  It's nothing wrong with it.  I don't love it.  No, it's not anything you like, but it's.  It keeps her fucking yap shut.  And you just can just blast.  You seem to really like this one.  Blast worry-free.  How you talk about her?  I do, actually.  I fucking, but I pulled out because the period was ending. 
[02:24:30]  Yeah.  And I fucking arced, she makes me cum like a girl.  I make girl noises when I cum.  Like, oh, oh, oh.  I really feel like cum like a bitch.  I never fucking made noise like that when I came.  I actually squeal when I cum.  Wow.  And I fucking arced one.  I was kneeling between her legs from her box to her hair, one shot.  Wow, that's a good one.  She was like, I got it in my hair, and I had to go, I'm sorry, but I wanted to go, yay for me.  Yay for Mr. Distance.  That's impressive. 
[02:25:00]  Yeah, it was a great one.  It's all in the, when you release, how, is it in rhythm with the fucking, are you opening  the fucking valve right there at the, at that rhythm where, whammo, the muscles contract  good.  Ah!  You go, ah!  Like a, I really do, I make a very high-pitched, it happened recently, it's been fucking, it's  been a squeal of delight as I cum.  You sound like anime.  It's fucking hilarious. 
[02:25:30]  Yeah, like Japanese anime.  Yeah, Jimmy comes like Japanese anime.  Oh, yeah!  Yeah!  Oh, yeah!  And she puts me in a wedding dress and shits on my face.  That's great.  Yeah.  Good for you, Jimmy.  Jimmy's happy.  So what do you do with your, uh, your, uh, you know, bloody dick?  Um, fucking, I wipe it in her mouth.  Say, let's recycle this, toots.  No, it hasn't been that bad.  Um, I've gotten some, like, little fucking copper flakes.  It's the light day.  Looked like I was fucking rusty metal. 
[02:26:00]  I got some copper flakes against my skin.  And then, uh, I'll just fucking go, I'll just go fucking, I'll scoop water from the sink  right on my hog.  That's it.  And she'll go in and fucking plop on a ball and we chit-chat.  She's pretty cool.  Yeah, that's all you need to do.  There you go.  Oh, good for you, Jimmy.  I had never, like, fucked on a period before.  But my, I've had a couple girlfriends like it.  It's not that uncommon.  Like, this girl is like, yeah, it helps with the cramps.  That's what they all say, but they don't want to just go like, I'm a whore who needs  dick.  But, uh, my ex-girlfriend loved it. 
[02:26:30]  And I was like, nah, I'm not having it.  Yeah.  Yeah, I should get helps with cramps, really.  Yeah, yeah.  Stay home, cranky.  Fuck, take an aspirin.  Yeah, sleep on the floor, fucking penny panties.  Fucking whole room.  Penny panties.  Whole room smells like my fucking coin jar.  Fucking don't prepare my meals.  Lay at the foot of my bed like an animal.  That's what I do.  I make them sleep on an afghan at the foot of the bed like fucking Labradors. 
[02:27:00]  Don't bleed on my comforter.  Fucking naughty girl.  Oh, god damn.  But it's kind of cool.  I lay a towel down now.  I don't even mind.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm like, yeah.  You got your period towel?  See, we go through towels so fast.  That's what I wipe cum up with.  Towels?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's the best thing.  Most absorbent.  It really is.  And tissues are inconvenient.  You wake up and there's fucking tissue over the head of your dick.  Yeah, it looks like my cock was shaving in the middle of the night.  Oh, my god.  It fucking nicked itself for the dick. 
[02:27:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, toilet paper is the worst for that shit.  You can't use any kind of wet.  You know what works is the fucking duty wipes, the wet wipes?  Yeah, wet wipes are really good.  I, uh, if it's really bad, I'll just go in the shower real quick.  Yeah, I would shower.  And just, uh, hose, hose down.  And you don't even.  Yeah, just hose down, you know.  Just the, just the cock and ball and ass area.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, wash the undercarriage.  Yeah.  Where the old true coat is.  Yeah.  You gotta kind of.  And then you look at your washcloth and just like, oops, looks like the floor of a mash. 
[02:28:00]  The worst is when you've been fucking, right?  And, uh, sometimes the pre-cum gets a weird mix with her juices.  And there's like little fucking, like little pieces of fucking, uh, it's just weird once  in a while when you're fucking and it's chafing and there's like a little.  A little piece of, um.  Whatever the fucking.  Whatever that is.  Whatever it happens to it.  Whatever.  You mix juices and rub up against vag walls. 
[02:28:30]  Then you start to lick the pussy and you gotta go.  Oh, fuck.  Yuck.  What is that?  You're making an emulsion.  There's some kind of fucking chemical reaction happening.  Yeah, it really is.  Yeah.  My cum, I got, I tell you one thing.  I, uh, I, I got a, I made a whoopsie and a little bit went into her last night.  And she's finishing up her period.  She's almost done.  Yeah.  But, um, she was gonna cum and I, I pulled out and, uh, it was doggy style. 
[02:29:00]  And I went, ah, and I came on her back.  I, I made, I made the fucking woman noise.  And I'm like, I'm just kind of collapsing forward as I cum.  It's so unsexy.  Because she's like kind of.  Wow.  She's on her hands and knees.  And I'm, I'm, I'm, and she's getting ready to fucking, to orgasm.  But I can't time it.  Because I have to cum.  So I'm like, ah.  And I cum on her back and I collapse forward with my fucking fat older man tits.  You just wrecked her orgasm.  Dude, and I'm like, I, I came right when you were about to start. 
[02:29:30]  She's like, yeah.  So I'm like, I'll take care of you.  So I toweled off her back.  And I fucking, uh, I got my fucking, you know, I'm fingering her.  But it was so warm because a little cum went in there.  It was actually hot.  And, uh, it started to burn my finger because I had my fucking, uh, my cut on my finger,  my paper cut.  Burned your, oh, the pain.  It was a cunt.  Okay.  It was, it was the, uh, the cunt, the semen inside of her.  I had to actually take my, my middle finger out because it was fucking hurting.  Aw.  Oh, it's burning.  Your cumsies were making your paper cut hurt.  Boy, a fucking semen doesn't play games. 
[02:30:00]  It really wants to, really wants to, I'm 40.  My semen really wants to get to the old egg-a-roo.  It's like, it's flamethrowing the inside of the vag.  Yeah, they're probably squirming up the cut in your finger thinking it's part of the vag.  Where is it?  Where's the egg?  I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it.  We have to take a break.  I have to go.  Just because we got, uh, the guests are starting to back up.  Oh, okay.  We got Jim Gaffigan, uh, standing by. 
[02:30:30]  Oh, he's all right.  His new CD's called King Baby.  We're going to give you a little taste of that as we go to break.  And then at 9.30, this is what I mean, it's backing up.  Uh, we got Kurt Angle, uh, coming in.  And we haven't seen him in about nine years.  I think he's, uh.  I can't imagine it's been that long.  I think he's wrestling in, uh, McFoley's League.  Really?  That McFoley thing.  What is it, TNT or something?  TNT.  But first, Jim Gaffigan from King Baby, uh, a little taste of his comedy.  We'll see how to, uh, Jim next.  There was always that travel pressure.  You know, the eating travel pressure. 
[02:31:00]  And it's like, oh, you're going to Austin?  You gotta get barbecue.  Gotta get barbecue in Austin.  Every city, you know, has a food they're famous for.  It's almost like there was a meeting.  Okay, Chicago, what do you pick?  Deepness pizza.  Okay, Philadelphia cheesesteak.  Okay, Boston beans.  You want beans?  Yeah, beans are awesome.  They're wicked awesome.  The Yankees talking Dunkin' Donuts, right? 
[02:31:30]  Dunkin' Donuts.  Dunkin' Donuts.  New England loves their Dunkin' Donuts.  Some people love Dunkin' Donuts too much.  Dunkin' Donuts is awesome.  Uh, I think they're just making donuts, not curing lupus.  I like Dunkin' Donuts, but have you been to a Dunkin' Donuts that doesn't have a homeless guy standing in front?  Is that part of the design plans?  There'll be an entrance here, a deranged lunatic here.  There's always a guy standing out there like their Ronald McDonald. 
[02:32:00]  Dunkin' Donuts.  It's an interesting concept, really.  It's almost as if AA opened their own restaurant.  What should we have?  Coffee?  Donuts?  Maybe a little honesty.  Hi, my name's Jim.  I haven't had a donut in 30 seconds.  I don't know how Dunkin' Donuts even stays in business.  They sell 3,000 donuts.  What do they make, 30 bucks?  Whenever I go in there, it seems like they're trying to get rid of the donuts. 
[02:32:30]  Like, yeah, I'll have six donuts.  That'll be $3, but if you get a dozen, it's a nickel.  How much are two does?  We give you $10.  We're either trying to get rid of them or trying to get us addicted.  You ever buy a couple of donuts, you open it up, and there's some free munchkins in there?  Those are the gateway donuts.  First time's always free. 
[02:33:00]  Now at some locations, they have Dunkin' Donuts and Baskin Robbins in the same building.  It's like a marriage made in obesity.  Finally, Dunkin' Donuts is offering something for dessert.  Donuts and ice cream.  It's like two pairs of dirty underwear.  Who knows?  Opie and Anthony in studio. 
[02:33:30]  Jim Gaffigan.  The very funny Jim Gaffigan.  I just took a picture of him drinking coffee, because that's what the social networking sites are all about.  You social networked there, Jim?  Yeah, I've gone back to the Twittering thing.  Yeah?  You know, that whole internet thing is taking off.  It might just take off.  Well, it's also...  It has potential.  It's also like, you know, if you're doing, you know, shows, it's... 
[02:34:00]  You know this.  It's like...  I'm pointing to Jim.  Yeah.  But it's like, if you...  It's like, Facebook's perfect.  It's like, all right, I'm going to Atlantic City.  Search everyone from Atlantic City.  Perfect.  So...  See, I hit them all with it, though.  I don't even search them out.  I'm like, I make the Boston people listen to my Texas updates.  Fuck them all.  Deal with it.  You never know.  Maybe one will be vacationing.  That's exactly what I tell myself.  Yeah.  That's what I tell you.  Let them sort it out.  The Twitter thing, it's like, I'm really terrified because I'm, you know, my life is really not 
[02:34:30]  that interesting at all.  So it's like, I had a burrito.  Yeah.  You know?  That's what most of them are.  But you feel like you have to update it.  Like, I haven't written anything.  So you kind of look around and go, what can I...  Yeah.  What can I snap a picture of and upload?  Yeah.  It's like, how about Gaffigan drinking coffee?  Exactly.  It should be something exciting.  All right.  You know, this is a perfect time.  I got a Twitter confession.  Yes. 
[02:35:00]  I did not play Cowbell with the Allman Brothers.  You didn't?  No.  I tweeted that, though.  You tweeted it?  I feel ashamed.  I don't know.  Did anyone really think you did?  They did?  I did.  Yes.  I don't know how to read Twitter or any of that stuff.  I was at the Allman Brothers show, and I was lucky enough to be on the stage with a bunch  of other zeros, meaning myself as one of the zeros.  And I tweeted that I'm on stage, which was true.  And then I go, oh, my God.  A dream came true.  They actually asked me to play Cowbell on Statesboro Blues. 
[02:35:30]  And I sent it out.  Like, there's no way anyone's going to believe this.  Yeah.  And the replies, everyone believed it.  Like, holy shit, you're the luckiest, man.  I'm a big Allman Brothers fan.  Oh, my God.  I can't believe it.  Oh, how did that feel?  Oh, my God.  So, I have a Twitter confession.  You lied on Twitter.  You got it out there.  That's the most important.  Do you have a Twitter confession, Ed?  No.  Have you stretched the truth a little bit?  I don't tweet enough to get to the bullshitting, lying part of it.  I actually do it out there like no one's going to believe this. 
[02:36:00]  Yeah.  I'm, like, doing a lot of experiments, social experimentation going on.  Yeah.  And I experiment.  I'm like, all right, will they believe anything I write?  So, I wrote that.  And sure enough, they bought it hook, line, and sinker.  I think they will pretty much believe anything that you write on Twitter for some reason.  Right.  So.  I'm going to tweet my driver's license photo.  I'm going to tweet it.  Do it.  Tweety, tweety, tweety, tweet.  Tweet, tweet, tweet.  In promoting this special, because there's always that fear, like, no one's going to watch, 
[02:36:30]  and then, like, Comedy Central's going to be like, why?  Oh, that's why you're here?  You're actually promoting something?  No, no.  But the thing is, like, I've been, have you ever tried to do a vlog a day?  What's a vlog?  It's the video.  It's the video, obviously.  It sounds.  But I've been trying to do it.  It's really fucking hard.  Yeah.  It's really hard, because you're like, all right, well, it can't suck completely.  I've got to think of an idea.  That's something.  Yeah.  Put pressure.  But you don't want to, like, do, like, three takes of it. 
[02:37:00]  So I always end up like, all right, that's good enough.  Good enough.  I did put it up there.  Have you seen the shit out there, though?  It's like, it's so easy to do something that isn't as bad as that.  Oh, that's true.  Yeah, that's for sure.  There's some really bad shit out there.  All right.  At least you have a name.  One moment of humor in it, I guess.  Right.  That's better than, like, most of us.  One moment's fine.  Well, we should say the Comedy Central special is King Baby.  Yes, King Baby.  And when is that on?  I don't have the one sheet in front of me.  It's Sunday.  Yes, I do. 
[02:37:30]  The Sunday at Comedy Central?  Sunday.  At 9 p.m.  And then they're replaying it at 10.  Yeah, I don't know what that is.  That's a weird replay.  Yeah.  You would think they would, like, maybe throw a couple other things in and then get back to you.  It's probably East and West Coast.  There's a reason for that on East and West Coast.  Yeah.  It's a CD and a DVD, and it's being released March 31st.  JimGaffigan.com.  I'm very excited.  Mine are all, most of my videos that I put up are of me shooting guns.  I figure guns are kind of interesting. 
[02:38:00]  Yeah.  Like, people, if they're into guns, they'll watch it.  And if they're not, they're so like, oh, my God, what a lunatic kind of a thing.  Are you thinking of stalking me?  Look at this video.  Yeah.  Check this one out.  Boom, boom.  I started watching this show last night on the sniper competition, the world sniper competition.  For some reason, now it's like a game show.  It's like just blowing people's heads off as a game.  I don't know where we're at these days.  But all it's doing is making me look up new weapons that I'm going to spend a lot of money on. 
[02:38:30]  Because I saw a sniper rifle that I have no need for.  But I just kind of want to have it.  Was that, like, what do they get?  People that want to be snipers?  No, it's actual.  Do you want to replace the DC sniper?  Yeah, what if it was illegal snipers?  That would be one thing.  That would be more a reality show for, like, VH1 or something like that.  This is on the military channel, where every commercial is for the Army. 
[02:39:00]  Yes.  And they bring in these sniper teams from all over the world, and they compete with each other.  Yeah.  Like, last night, they actually had to shoot stuff out of a helicopter, out of a Black Hawk helicopter.  And then they have, like, 1,000 yards.  You've got to hit something.  Holy.  And, yeah, it's really interesting.  But I saw, like, one of the guys was like, yeah, I decided to bring this gun instead of one of the real long-barreled ones.  Because some of the competition, I'm like, what is that?  And I need that immediately.  And I got my laptop, and I was like, what is, all right, it's that. 
[02:39:30]  I could get that in the semi-automatic.  I'm in.  I need a sniper rifle.  Hopefully they have it in brown.  I don't need one.  Yeah.  Do you have this in a brown with a Leopold scope?  Is it like most reality shows, like all the snipers live in a house?  Yeah, and then one's voted out.  Actually, they shoot him as he's trying to run to his car.  It's like a confessional.  You know, I really was angry when I didn't hit that target, but Braden was there to help me get through it. 
[02:40:00]  My partner stings.  He can't call out the proper ranges.  All right, we're all teaming up to think of our sniper notes that we're going to leave at every sniper scene.  It's called sharpshooters or something like that?  I think it's just.  There's a couple of sniper shows out now.  I don't know why.  The sniper is so big right now.  They have one on just sharpshooters.  I wonder if it's the same one.  Sniper 2 or something.  Very cool.  Yeah, it's a pretty interesting show. 
[02:40:30]  The military channel is just on my TV all the time.  Wow.  I don't know what it is.  I just can't get enough of watching where my tax dollars go, I guess.  It's kind of nice to say, hey, I paid for a rivet on that fin.  What about a show where people are just like snipers just shooting things?  See, that would be good.  You know what that would be good for?  What were we talking about before?  Now, that's an interesting Twitter guy.  A serial killer, something like that.  Oh, wow.  And he can twit and go, hey, how should I pose?  I want to pose the body. 
[02:41:00]  How should I do it?  And then people can suggest, put the hand over the head, make it look a little weird.  Chop the head on, put it in the window.  Oh, it's been done.  It's called top sniper.  Yes, top sniper.  Like top gun for snipers.  Top sniper.  Yeah.  I'd love it if somebody started doing that and they're like, ONA suggested it.  Yeah, I heard, I get this epiphany while listening to ONA once.  I was a normal guy, family, and I decided, let me start killing people and Twittering it. 
[02:41:30]  You know, Jim Gaffigan brings up something that we got to, one of our biggest claims to fame was one of our guys, not guys, one of our listeners, we didn't know him personally, got kind of caught up in that old stingaroonie that Chris Hansen was doing.  No way.  A listener.  A listener.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  With a, you were really funny on the Opie and Anthony show, and this Chris Hansen decided to leave it into that particular episode.  Yeah, the guy's just there.  One of our listeners took the bait, had a little, some cookies and a little lemonade and everything. 
[02:42:00]  Yeah, the Zima and condoms with him, you know, the fucking instant, you're going to get the 14-year-old girl with the Zima.  Right.  And it is amazing, they took that show off the air.  Is this still off the air, Daylight?  Did they?  Yeah.  I don't know.  No, I used to watch it, you know, that's the show that you didn't want to admit that you watched too much.  Oh, I watched it all the time.  You're like, oh, I've seen that, I've seen that show so much, I love that show, I've got it on DVD.  Yeah.  It's the fucking, it's the same thing, it's Can the Camera without Alan Funt.  Well, you know.  And it's one gag.  And it's not smile. 
[02:42:30]  No, it's not smile.  You're like, I wonder what's going to happen to this guy.  You know what, this time the pedophile's going to get his way.  Yeah.  It never ends up that way.  And now, as Fanny Flagg playing the part of the 14-year-old, Maury Amsterdam is a police officer.  Chris Hansen's a sick fuck, because he gives them a little hope that they might be, they might be off the hook.  Okay, you're free to go.  And then they leave the house like, really?  You're sick.  And the cops come out of nowhere and just tackle him.  Yeah, they're dressed as trees in the yard and stuff. 
[02:43:00]  Great.  That's sounding like William H. Macy at the end of Fargo.  No!  No!  It would be tough to have Chris Hansen as a dad, you know.  What are you doing here?  I'm just having breakfast.  Really?  Really?  You're taking out my daughter.  Yes.  Where are you going?  Why don't you sit down and have some lemonade?  Okay, I'm sorry.  My daughter is five.  And you're 50.  I'm sorry, sir. 
[02:43:30]  I'm sorry.  There was that one guy that they caught, and then they caught again.  Yeah.  In the second episode.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm sorry, sir.  Sorry.  Like, he was the most polite pedophile.  He just can't stop this frothing.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, sir.  You knew this was wrong.  Let me read the transcript.  I'm just going to McDonald's, sir.  Yeah.  I just want something to eat.  I'm hungry.  I'm just in the jungle gym area of McDonald's, sir. 
[02:44:00]  Oh, we nailed Chris Hansen that time he came in.  Because during his show, part of it is he embarrasses the pedophiles by reading their transcripts.  He goes, were you trying to have sex with an underage girl?  Uh, no.  And they were like, no, no.  I was just coming over.  Well, let me read this.  I, uh, how old are you?  Fourteen.  I like that.  I'd like to sleep with you.  Have you ever tried ass sex?  Have you ever? 
[02:44:30]  So we just cut out all the part where he says it's someone else, and we just played Chris Hansen saying all this stuff?  To Chris Hansen.  To Chris Hansen.  And so he was, he was going around promoting the show.  Yeah, yeah.  So he's on our show.  And we played those clips.  I'm a journalist.  Yeah.  We played the clips.  I hate to be a banjo.  Commerce is not, uh, infiltrated journalism at all.  No, no, no.  Not at all.  Not at all.  They realized it was such a huge hit.  Like, people just wanted to see that.  It was candid camera and, and, again, criminals. 
[02:45:00]  Anthony did Chris Hansen to Chris Hansen.  It was very confusing.  Why don't you sit down and have some lemonade?  And we had lemonade set up for him and everything.  And then it's like, Chris, did you say this?  Listen to this tape.  And he's just talking about ravaging some young girl.  But it was transcripts.  He turned fucking beet red.  Yeah, that's unbelievable.  But, yeah, he was just going around on the little tour.  He was doing a promotional tour.  Tour circuit and everything.  Yeah.  For Catch a Predator.  Yeah, Catch a Predator.  Well, tomorrow I'm promoting Predator, and, uh, later on I'm going to be going on Regis  and Kelly Lee. 
[02:45:30]  It was, uh, yeah, the other, but the guy, the guy that was.  He was just co-hosting with Regis.  Yeah.  The fan of our show, though, was so, like, he's just sitting there like, um, yeah.  Yeah, I did.  I came here.  He goes, by the way, I thought you were great.  I loved you on Opie and Anthony.  And he's like, you loved me on Opie and Anthony.  Oh, my God.  Because he's got to repeat everything.  You know how they say, you know, bad presses, good presses.  Yeah.  There was that one?  Yeah, great. 
[02:46:00]  There was the cement mixer.  That's one of my favorites.  Yeah.  A dump truck.  That hit, ran some bike messenger over or something.  That destroyed a bike messenger or a whole family, some horrific accident.  It was in the paper with a nice Opie and Anthony wow sticker on the back of the dump truck.  On the back.  That's good.  You always look for the t-shirts.  That's another one.  Yeah, we've had a few arrested with an Opie and Anthony t-shirt.  Nice.  Yeah.  Nice.  I guess nothing beats a pedophile, though.  Yeah, those are, uh.  We got the clip.  Those are the status.  Oh, is that what? 
[02:46:30]  You got it?  Good.  Let's give it a good listen.  You got just a part of it.  I just like hearing Chris Hansen's voice.  Yeah, listen to this.  For Jim Gaffigan, who's promoting King Baby on Comedy Central.  This, uh, you said Sunday?  Sunday.  Sunday at 9 on Comedy Central.  I want you to just keep your hands right where I can see them, okay?  And I want you to sit right down there.  No, keep your hands, keep your hands right where I can see them, all right?  I can't touch my dick.  What is this right here?  Some pot.  Some pot.  And what was your plan tonight? 
[02:47:00]  I wanted to come down, you know, talk to her.  Talk to her.  Talk to her.  You're Chris Hansen.  I am.  I'm Chris Hansen.  Have you seen this show?  You haven't seen it.  I thought you were real funny on Opie and Anthony.  Oh, you listen to me on Opie and Anthony?  Oof.  Wow.  Nice and ringing endorsement for the program.  You sure you have to sit there, John?  You can flee if you want.  I mean, I would understand.  Did that show, I think that show, didn't like one of the guys, like he stalked a guy to his 
[02:47:30]  house and then he killed himself?  Yeah.  Prosecutor in Dallas.  And that's what ended the show.  And the scumbag family fucking sued.  It wasn't Jon Stewart.  It was that.  Why did Jon Stewart not like this show?  No, I'm totally joking.  It was some guy that got caught and was a little upset.  And he did what he should have done.  He fucking just shot himself.  That's what he should do if you get fucking clicking child porn.  Fuck you.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Well, if you're caught, I mean.  Yeah.  Unbelievable. 
[02:48:00]  So, what are you going to do?  What are you going to do is write.  One of those favorite moments.  You had to feel like, you know, MSNBC probably had to purchase the rights to it.  Like, there was negotiations.  All right.  How much can we pay you for the pedophile stuff?  He, that really made a name for him, that whole series.  And then he tried doing other ones, but they just didn't have that panache that the old  pedos have.  To catch a gas thief, just one of those interesting things. 
[02:48:30]  To catch a check forger.  None of them had the same fucking bite.  He went after those Nigerian scams.  Oh, yeah.  Which are, you know.  Yeah.  I think if you're taken by one of those, give all your money to Nigeria.  You should go after the warranty people.  The warranty on your car.  With these numbers from all over the.  I mean, getting that and the Trooper, New York State Trooper Association, they have nothing  to do with the police.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  And they try to get money out of that. 
[02:49:00]  They get the donations.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And they get the donations.  But they really have nothing to do with the police department.  Supposedly, the car warranty thing, how they're making their money is all us dummies calling  them back.  Because those are all like hidden 1-800 numbers.  Yeah.  That's what I've been told.  Or 1-900 numbers.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Pay numbers.  I'm sorry.  Right.  They tell you that the warranty on your car is running out.  But they don't really want you to answer.  What they want is all us dummies.  We see a missed call from a weird number.  So we're like, ah, I got to call that back. 
[02:49:30]  And you call it back and they're making a little cash off you.  That's what I heard.  That's scumbags.  Yeah.  And we challenged them recently and they just will openly laugh at you and hang up on you.  What do you mean?  They just will openly laugh.  Oh, when you talk to them on the phone, you go, hey, you're full of shit.  I don't have a car.  I don't.  And at the time, I didn't have a car really.  Nothing with a warranty.  Yeah.  And I'm like, you know, please stop calling.  Take us off your no-call list.  All that crap.  And they just openly laugh and then hang up.  If you answer, you don't get charged. 
[02:50:00]  If they call and you answer, you don't get charged.  No, I understand that.  So then you just keep them on the phone as long as you can like an idiot and go, oh,  yes, I would like that warranty.  Oh, that's a good idea.  And then just keep them, let them go through the whole bullshittery and then just go like,  oh, should have that undercoat.  Yeah.  That's sweet.  Sam.  Crazy Liz is here.  Who's Crazy Liz?  She's back for a second appearance.  She's back.  Should we bring her in?  Yeah. 
[02:50:30]  She's back.  You want to meet a crazy broad?  Um.  Well, she's not.  It's not crazy like, you know, anything bad is going to happen.  All right.  Okay.  There's metal detectors?  This is Crazy Liz.  Oh, look at you wearing little yellow pants today and, uh, the same pink thing and the  same, and now the same babushka around your neck.  What are you eating?  Chuxmugs.  Want some?  No.  She's just kind of, you notice after a few minutes that this. 
[02:51:00]  No, but I knew she was going to be on the show today.  All right.  How are you?  Good.  How are you?  You notice after a few minutes that there's something a little wrong with her.  We can't figure out what it is.  She looks normal.  Well, kind of.  She's a little, like, weird, though.  Like, you're a little bit weird.  Not, I'm not saying it's awful or anything, but, like, you got kind of that thousand-yard  stare and...  Are you on meds today?  Yep.  I started them up again last night.  Oh, so you're not like, y'all. 
[02:51:30]  Yeah.  She looks like...  Y'all.  Taw.  I just have my brain today.  How's your Chex Mix?  Salty.  I only had two pieces.  I didn't have breakfast, so I just needed...  I like Chex Mix.  Yeah.  A little bit that much.  Yikes.  I'm afraid her crazy fingers put crazy dust on it.  No, I only had two pieces.  All right.  What med did you go back on?  He won't stick his hand in the bag.  Well, I'm on Lexapro and lorizopam, but I'm not sure which is which.  You're welcome.  Oh, that's good.  I'm on marzipan. 
[02:52:00]  Marzipan?  It's delicious.  Good.  I hate marzipan.  What's that thing?  That's a candy.  It's a candy.  Yeah.  A boo.  It was good.  Are you crunching out of the microphone?  If I'm moving.  She's not as crazy today.  No.  You could see it.  She's back on meds.  How were you crazy before?  These fucking meds are really fucking people up, because I liked you kind of crazy.  Well, Jim Gavigan, within 10 minutes, she was completely nude, and we were sketching  her.  Right.  Sketching.  Yeah.  Take a look at the sketch.  It's hysterical.  Well. 
[02:52:30]  Yeah?  By the way, did you shave yet?  No.  Why?  I didn't take a shower.  What?  I didn't take a shower.  Yesterday?  No.  You're kidding, right?  Nice and stinky.  Why don't you put the odor in them?  Are you smelly?  No.  I don't wash my face.  Does your hiney smell?  Wait, you were going to say something about the sketch.  Yeah, it probably smells.  Our hiney.  Oh, no.  I was going to talk about my medicine.  Oh, right.  Oh, my God.  Please send that to me.  Look at the evil picture of the broadcast.  Doug, please send that to me immediately. 
[02:53:00]  Oh, wow.  That's good.  You've got glowing eyeballs.  Can I make you guys cookies?  Huh?  No.  Yeah, you can make us cookies.  Are you, like, if I made you cookies, would you eat them or would you think I'd poison them?  Not that I will.  Ha, ha, ha.  What do you got to say?  Wow.  Or would you think I'd poison them?  How about this?  Can you make cookies in front of us?  Because I enjoy a nice, warm cookie.  What, an easy-bake oven?  How is she going to do it?  Can we get that done or is that against the rules?  What kind of cookies would you make?  Do you like rainbow cookies?  What?  What? 
[02:53:30]  Shit and crushed glass cookies.  No, they're tri-colored cookies.  They have in, like, Italian bellies.  I've seen those.  Yeah, yeah.  I like oatmeal.  I like peanut butter.  I like chocolate chip.  Peanut butter sucks a dick.  You don't like peanut butter?  Peanut butter is the best.  It's fucking fantastic.  No, not a cookie.  You've got to be pale like us to enjoy a peanut butter cookie.  Peanut butter and chocolate is my favorite team.  Yes.  You need to just take a scoop of peanut butter, though, and then put it on top of a cookie.  You're right, young lady.  What about an oatmeal raisin every once in a while?  That's good.  Anybody? 
[02:54:00]  Vincent makes good oatmeal raisin cookies.  No.  That sounds like work.  Oatmeal raisin.  No, but if you make them raisin.  Oatmeal bad, raisin worse.  Sony Newquals makes some great vegan oatmeal raisin cookies.  Are you a vegan?  That vegan shit does.  Well, oatmeal raisin and raisins are not fucking animals.  Chex Nix wouldn't be.  There's no milk in here.  No, there's probably some kind of fucking animal fat that those vegans would be like,  No, I can't eat that, man.  You're done with animal labor, man.  It's got to be, you know, this corporate Chex, man.  Yeah. 
[02:54:30]  Ugh.  I hate hippies.  Yeah.  Wow, Maury's really going out on a limb today.  One woman, five kids, 15 men tested.  Who's the dad?  Did he just do this yesterday?  This is every show Maury does now.  Every show.  All right, Liz.  Have you been pregnant?  Have I been?  Yeah.  No.  All right.  Am I right now?  Just wondering.  Are you now?  Are you?  Do you like period sex?  No.  My girlfriend?  What?  Ew.  Ew.  We were talking about that last week.  That's just... 
[02:55:00]  What's wrong with you?  But how can it be good for anyone?  It's great.  It's a warm and moist fucking pump and repeat.  No.  No?  Oh, you're on Ativan.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But it's like a different name of it.  No, I know.  I just...  Because I know Ativan.  What is it for?  Depression, anxiety.  Yeah.  Yeah.  See, you're a lot more like you like depression, anxiety.  Depression, anxiety.  And yesterday you'd have been like, depression, anxiety.  You'd have been like, hey, I'm a little wacky.  When you said yesterday, like the electrical pulse is in your head of it. 
[02:55:30]  It's because I'm low energy, high energy.  Like, I was really getting that, so that freaked me out about...  Gaffigan's a nice observation.  Yeah, they're two different emotions, though.  Depression, anxiety.  That seems like the opposite things, right?  Well, they were, like, caused by each other.  Huh?  You're depressed because you're anxious.  All right.  Basically.  And then you're anxious because they're depressed.  Basically.  It's a vicious cycle.  The key is this.  You want to feel better?  Why don't you shave a little bit?  You feel a lot better.  I'm telling you, there's no reason to leave hair growing.  It's a mess.  No.  It's wispy.  What's wrong with the...  There's nothing wrong with her... 
[02:56:00]  There's a lot wrong with it.  Get rid of it.  I ain't got no bush.  You what?  I ain't got no bush.  You shave?  Maybe she's starting a trend.  It's all coming back now.  Yeah.  The 70s are coming back in a big way.  Oh, please.  Not that bad.  So the medication, you were off it and then you're back on?  Well, I left it at home this weekend.  Oopsie.  So I was off it for like three days.  Oops.  And where were you for three days?  In Queens.  I just like...  I left my purse in the car.  Right.  I mean, I do that.  No, but you weren't home, but you live in New York City and you were in Queens this weekend. 
[02:56:30]  Oh, no.  I live in Rockland and I was in Queens.  Oh.  You're wandering around Queens.  Yeah.  I mean, hey, where's my medicine?  I'm depressed and anxious.  Wow.  Don't worry.  The lights came on.  Yeah.  I freaked you out, didn't it?  Sometimes when the lights get dim in a restaurant, you go like, ah, I got a brain tumor.  And how do you feel differently when you're not on your medication?  Well, yesterday was the first time that I was off it for like...  Three days?  Like six or seven months, I guess.  Yeah.  It was just like my body was blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. 
[02:57:00]  Yeah, see?  That's more like you.  Like, I just couldn't control my body.  How is she behaving differently than before, if you don't mind?  She's not a psycho today.  Yes.  Yesterday, there was...  You were very peculiar before.  I was, yeah.  She was dancing.  She was just a little odd.  She was dancing for us.  It was very borderline.  I would still dance if I wasn't on my dance.  It wasn't crazy like she's just go-go-go-go-go, but you could tell it was just something  a little off yesterday.  And do you have a job?  Are you going to work?  Do you have a job at $99? 
[02:57:30]  What's that?  You could be approved for a brand new car.  See, she was doing stuff like that, too.  At least the medicine isn't sticking to every synapse.  See?  A little oozing just after.  But you're walking to work, and you're like, you know what?  I'm going to go by and see Opie and Anthony, right?  Well, I live in Rockland, which is not here.  Right.  Oh, so you plan to come in.  You guys...  Yeah, yeah.  She comes in.  Well, yesterday I came in.  Okay.  I decided I'll skip my classes.  So come here. 
[02:58:00]  All right.  All right.  She's getting a little weirder.  Should we throw her back onto the bleachers?  Look at my face!  Yeah, you're on camera.  You all right?  You all right there?  Wait, but which side is it coming from?  No, it's from...  No, no, right?  No.  The other way.  The other way.  Straight.  No.  I see the side of my face.  Right.  No.  You do...  See, if you turn really fast, it's not...  She just turned really fast.  She's looking around and trying to see where he's coming from.  That's the funniest damn thing.  Like, now she's just going to walk toward it. 
[02:58:30]  Yeah.  Where is it?  By the way, Jim Gaffney, that's Jim Norton's sketch of Crazy Liz.  We got it crazily looking into the camera.  It looks like a photograph.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's beautiful, isn't it?  It's a classic park.  It kind of looks like a John Lennon sketch, Jimmy.  In good company.  You have to know John Lennon's sketch.  What is she holding there?  Is that...  They're awful.  Her shawl.  That was a shawl.  I even wrote shawl on it to clear up any...  Yeah.  Yeah.  Sorry.  All good shawl will always have shawl written on it.  What was she doing, man? 
[02:59:00]  Oh, watch.  She looked like a Romanian old lady.  Or an old Romanian lady, see?  She goes there.  And the Israelis have occupied...  See?  You look different on your Facebook pictures.  Thank you.  I talked to everyone that added yesterday.  You and you didn't add me yet.  I didn't add anybody yet.  On Facebook?  Yeah.  I haven't checked my Facebook in so long.  I got like 3,000 friggin' things I gotta go through. 
[02:59:30]  I can't even believe how you can do that.  I'm just very addicted to it.  I'm very Facebook irresponsible.  Yeah.  And I know this.  Do you have an agenda?  Calendar?  Mark it down?  No.  I live by my calendar.  Why?  Your Facebook calendar?  No.  No, she's got like what?  An organizer or something?  Do you have like a far side calendar?  You laugh every day.  You pull the...  I had a German phrase of the day calendar for a while.  Oh, great.  Eat this shit.  Beat it, Jew.  Oh, God.  What...  What's your organizer have in it? 
[03:00:00]  Like, can we see what your...  Oh, I don't...  I didn't bring it with me today.  I didn't bring it with you.  Oh.  What's like...  Give us a day.  What's your agenda?  Some of her tasks?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, sometimes I'll write down everything I have to do.  Don't we hold this?  Is your arm getting tired?  Why don't you come off the mic stand?  All right.  Hey, Anthony, as we reset her, Jersey Matt writes, you should get a laser point.  And see if Crazy Liz chases it around like a cat.  We saw a cat doing that this weekend.  I was going to eat that cat.  It was so cute.  You were going to eat a cat? 
[03:00:30]  Well, figuratively speaking, I bet.  Well, you never know.  A Scottish fold cat?  No.  Oh, my God.  You know, you're taking Jim Gaffigan's time.  That's all right.  So at least, like, talk to him.  So, you know.  Jim, have you ever seen a Scottish fold cat?  Uh, no, I don't think so.  I don't know names of cats.  But they're...  What?  Who cleans in this office?  Lars.  Why?  What's the matter?  What's wrong with the cleaning supplies?  No, I was just curious.  Why do you ask?  Because I clean.  You want to start cleaning?  Is that what you do for, like, a business? 
[03:01:00]  What is your job?  You didn't make that?  I make beds and clean houses.  You didn't tell us that yesterday.  Oh, my God.  I didn't think about it yesterday.  She goes into...  You said school.  You missed school.  She goes into...  Where do you go to school?  I was in...  Yeah, the lights will go off and on every so often.  Don't worry.  For no fucking reason.  Really?  Yeah, there's a short somewhere.  Yeah.  He guards the front door.  Yeah.  I'm kidding, Joe.  Where do you go to school?  Well, I was at SUNY New Paltz for two years.  Yeah.  And then I went out to Las Vegas, and I hated it, so I dropped out of school after, like, 
[03:01:30]  two months.  And then, um...  What's wrong?  And then now I'm at Rockland Community College, and I'm going after the SUNY New Paltz.  Cool.  Tell me about you.  I'm kind of shy.  I don't believe that.  Really.  I like his shirt.  Let's try to get to know Jim Gavigan, because he's a bit shy.  Give him a little interview.  Yeah, help him out.  You want to go into broadcasting?  Make sure you mention his Comedy Central special happening Sunday at 9 o'clock. 
[03:02:00]  So, uh...  King Baby.  Jim Gavigan.  Tell me about your website.  Um, well, it's interesting.  It's, uh, it's called jimgavigan.com, and, um, right now it's promoting my new, uh, special.  Which is?  It's, uh, it's, uh, King Baby.  It's on this Sunday, uh, at 9 p.m. on Comedy Central.  Well, that's...  Ask him why King Baby.  That would be a great follow-up question.  Why King Baby?  Yeah. 
[03:02:30]  Well, that's, that's a really interesting question.  Um...  Excuse me.  I actually...  Are you all right?  I just had to clean my throat.  Oh, that's all right.  I, um...  Um, it's interesting.  King Baby is actually on this Sunday at 9 p.m.  But why...  That's like product placement.  It is.  It's a show?  It's...  Yeah, no.  It's actually a dance number.  It's a theory in physics.  What is this King Baby about?  It's about, um... 
[03:03:00]  It's about a king who's like a baby.  But he's like, he's like, uh...  You're not sure if it's like a king that's very immature.  Or like a baby that is royal.  You know?  That's kingly.  Did she say that?  Yeah, she goes, or a baby that's kingly.  And that's kind of the whole thing.  Yeah.  Hmm.  Do you have an eye contact problem?  Um...  Look at these babies.  Oh, you're saying Jim's not looking at your eyes?  She's disciplining.  She's looking at my eyes.  She's looking at that thing.  No, I'm sorry.  That's a microphone. 
[03:03:30]  Well, it's kind of hard.  Yeah.  Hey, I like your shirt.  Oh, there's a rabbit.  She's like your shirt girl today.  Oh, yeah.  What about Sam's hoodie?  That's pretty basic today.  Where's that from?  American Apparel?  I was gonna freaking say that.  Yeah.  You could tell because the white part is...  What?  I swear I was gonna say that.  You're like psychic.  Yeah.  Wait till those lights come on again.  I want to see you freak out.  Sam, do you like American Apparel?  I am a huge fan. 
[03:04:00]  But how are you doing?  You're doing alright?  Well, here's the thing, Jim.  This is about you, not me.  No, that's alright.  Yeah, we got a big audience today.  Where'd you get your yellow pants?  Urban Outfitters, holla back, $10.  Okay, see?  Do you kind of see?  You kind of get to just imagine that, but the whole time she was in yesterday.  Like acting like that?  Oh, so it was just yesterday.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Wait, these shits were supposed to be $80. 
[03:04:30]  No, they weren't.  Who the fuck would buy this shit for $80?  You know, everyone says that.  It's like, and I got these $80 pants for like $10.  It's like, no, you didn't.  They were fucking maybe $11 and you got them for $10.  There's a hole forming in them already.  Oh, shit.  There's a hole wearing them.  It's like a pinkish sweater and then very bright yellow pants.  Light green sneakers with the fucking pink laces.  I'm nice. 
[03:05:00]  You really are.  That was losing on Jim Gaffigan.  Yeah.  You know what those yellow pants, you know what dance I bet you could do?  The nanopuss.  The nanopuss.  I looked at it yesterday.  By the way.  Oh, you looked at nanopuss?  I saw the remix.  I couldn't find the original one.  And I saw someone in the studio.  Do you love how nanopuss knocks his own eye off?  It's the best part of nanopuss.  My girlfriend mentioned nanopuss before we banged.  As I was fucking her, I was thinking of nanopuss.  And Travis's nanopuss dance.  Because he dips down before he does it.  Yeah, yeah. 
[03:05:30]  It's fucking, it's so enraging.  It's so enraging.  Yeah.  Thank you.  Give me those.  Oh, Jesus.  Thanks.  No, you can.  All right, well.  We'll share.  You want to do the nanopuss?  That's pretty good.  That's actually it.  But you got to do the song.  We represent the lollipop guild.  Really?  You think that's like a lot like the nanopuss song?  That's what I think, yeah. 
[03:06:00]  When I think of it.  You never know.  Want some more Chex Mix?  No, I'm good for you.  Fuck.  All right.  Why'd you eat it all?  No, I just had them in my lap.  I was hoping she'd go fishing for Chex Mix and hit my penis.  Is your pal here today?  Yeah, I'm, yes.  Yudders and...  Yeah?  Really?  What?  What's wrong?  Where's your pal?  Hey.  Oh, there he is.  Oh, there he is. 
[03:06:30]  Oh, I just have to clarify something.  Adam is moving.  There you go.  He's going to be an air traffic controller.  He said you guys like planes.  What were you staring at, by the way?  Pushing tin, as they call it.  Yeah.  Hey, listeners, guess what?  There's a big fucking bunny in this room.  Wow.  See, sometimes, I think, I think you need a couple more days, and then you'll be completely  fine.  Yeah.  Because you're, like, really stable.  And then occasionally, you just, you're you from yesterday.  Because my body is, um, is connected to my head now. 
[03:07:00]  But the thing with the lights, and, like, a bunny, and, uh, that's, like, weird.  That's all.  What are you looking at?  Oh, you got a couple of friends in here?  She's walking over.  She just walked away from the microphone.  But I wasn't talking.  What?  What are you, uh...  What are you doing?  Ooh.  They're making me think that I'm crazy. 
[03:07:30]  Why is that?  Doesn't this microphone remind you of a big apple?  Yeah, that's the first thing we think.  Jim, does it remind you of a big apple?  It, uh, sure does.  You eat black apples?  No.  Where do you find black apples?  I know you can eat green apples.  In India.  In India, you can get black apples, huh?  I'm sure.  I like that he's suffocating.  You keep looking over there. 
[03:08:00]  You all right?  Now you're looking at the camera and pointing at it.  All right.  I'm gonna get you my baby.  She's just fucking weird.  She's just a little weird.  So you did, you did the show yesterday.  And then, um, did you run into some friends that saw the show, that heard the show and saw some of it online and all that?  Um, well, like, I got a lot of friend requests on Facebook and they all commented on my Facebook and then... 
[03:08:30]  Were they nice for the most part?  Most of them were really nice.  A few of them were, like, creepers.  Yeah, we get that.  Oh, let me film you, baby.  Yeah.  Oh, really?  You're so hot.  Let me...  Yeah.  Like, a few people were talking to me and they were really nice, but then, like, oh, man, you're, like, really cute.  We should hang out.  Yeah, okay.  Yeah, they're weird.  They sound like weird people.  From Jim Norton.  Those weird people. 
[03:09:00]  Oh, is that Sharpie still here from yesterday?  The what?  The Sharpie?  No, we...  Throw them out and have new ones every day brought in the studio.  We burn Sharpies after we use them, so, no.  We're rich.  Jim, are you excited for your show premiering?  I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, yeah, I am excited.  I'm going to watch it.  That's, uh, 9 p.m.  Coming to the show?  Yes, please.  You doing Letterman?  I, I, uh, did, I taped it last night.  It's, uh, Wednesday.  So you went from Letterman to this?  How good do you feel right now? 
[03:09:30]  Are you kidding?  I'm, you know, I've, uh, you guys have been on the air how many years?  Well, I don't know.  I think we're 15 years.  Yeah, it's been a while.  Yeah.  Many.  Been here a while.  What's with the green sneaks?  I'm going back.  All right, we, should we move on?  Hollaback.  Why, this is riveting.  Hollaback.  Where'd you get those, Hollaback?  Somewhere, downtown.  They're on sale.  Yeah.  Everything is.  They were $80 sneakers.  No, these were $50, but.  No, yeah, they were like $80 and I got them for $50.  Yeah, and you got them for $50. 
[03:10:00]  And I was, the best thing is.  More lies.  What are you doing now?  Hey, Liz.  Yeah?  Why didn't you, uh, hang out with any of the people who wanted to hang out with you?  Um, because I had to study for a psychology test.  Psychology?  When's the test?  Today.  Rorschach.  That's a psychology joke?  It's a good one, too.  I don't get it.  It would mean that you would be the kooky person.  Yeah, what are you going to do well in psychology?  All right.  Well, you know, we'll be in the second chapter. 
[03:10:30]  Just kidding.  We're in the 20th.  That's a good little chapter joke, though.  I enjoyed it.  Ah.  Should we, uh, take a break and reset with Jim Gaffigan?  Yeah, we can do that.  That's fine.  Bye, Jimmy.  Oh, Nanterpuss.  Nice to meet you.  You had a good interview with Jim Gaffigan.  I thought it went on.  She's taking her Chex Mix back, uh, Jimmy.  No!  My health won't allow it.  All right.  There's, uh, crazy Liz.  All right.  Get this poor bastard out of the funny city suffocating. 
[03:11:00]  Yeah.  She's dressed like Nanterpuss.  She, I know.  That's what I said.  Yeah.  Oh, I didn't hear you.  I'll just do that.  Listen to the replay.  You'll sound stupid.  Yeah.  All right.  This is what we're going to do.  Jim Gaffigan, you could hang, right?  We got Kurt Angle coming in.  I don't know.  I don't know what I'm supposed to do.  I, I, I, I don't know.  This show does that to people all the time.  No, no, I honestly have no idea.  You know, I have, like, uh.  In your mind, you're probably, I think I should have fleed about 20 minutes ago.  No, I, I honestly have no idea. 
[03:11:30]  I mean, there's a Comedy Central person here who can tell me what I'm supposed to do.  Can he stay?  Comedy Central person?  Ah.  I think I'm going to other.  Wah, wah, wah.  Yeah, we're going to.  I'm going to do the other Sirius XM channels.  Yeah.  The normal one.  No, you're going to do some normal radio.  The ones that probably, you know, have, like, eight listeners as opposed to, like, 800 million like you guys.  Oh, thank you.  This is what I say we do.  Jim Gaffigan's a friend of the show.  He's done our show for many, many years. 
[03:12:00]  The DVD's called King Baby.  The CD's called King Baby.  The special's on Comedy Central Sunday at 9.  And then the replay at 10.  It's some edgy material.  I want to play another track from your CD so we get a little Jim Gaffigan.  They're really long.  Just go to Jim Gaffigan.  Go to JimGaffigan.com for the, uh, for the fucking tour.  It's like a Yes album.  One joke is the whole side of it.  Well, the thing is, it's like, I don't know about you, Jim, but it's like, they want, like, you know, a joke is not six minutes long.  But they want the tracks. 
[03:12:30]  They're like, we'd like the tracks to just be 11 tracks.  And I'm like, but, um, it's, so it's like, uh, you know.  You don't want your stuff chopped up like this, right?  Well, I also don't want, I, you know, I don't want, you know, you're like, I'll play a track and it's like eight minutes.  It's like.  No, no, these things are like two minutes.  No, are they really?  Yeah, you got inside voice, bowling, any of these, tell me which one, lazy, escalators, camping, bed, bacon, ribs, and bologna, recycling, deodorant. 
[03:13:00]  Some edgy topics there.  We should have just used this as word association for, uh.  How about this, Jim?  Why don't you do bacon?  Bacon.  Pick a number between one and 17.  Bacon's always good.  Bacon is your number?  All right.  Bless you, Jim.  Bless you, you little lamb.  Thank you.  All right.  No, bacon's long.  It is?  How long is it?  Five minutes.  Oh, shit.  You don't want that, so.  Uh, ribs and bologna.  How long's that one?  Ribs and bologna.  Bologna?  I like saying bologna.  Three minutes and 30 seconds. 
[03:13:30]  Is that too long?  No, not for us.  We're just killing time until 10.30, so this is perfect for us.  So we don't phone it in every day.  Where's Kurt Angle, by the way?  He's not here yet?  He's on his way, so.  Oh, is he?  We might lose Jim Gavigan, and then when we get back, Kurt Angle.  But I appreciate you guys having me on, I'm serious.  From King Baby, this is  Ribs and Bologna.  Bologna.  Bologna.  No, he says bologna.  It's bologna.  That's how bologna is.  That's how bologna is.  DNA.  That's one of the jokes at the end of it.  It's bologna.  All right.  From King Baby.  Check this out. 
[03:14:00]  All right.  Jim Gavigan, thank you.  It was a pleasure.  I like meat, I do.  But you know who seems to be really obsessed with meat are vegetarians.  Now, for people that don't like meat, they seem to eat a lot of vegetables that are mashed  up and shaped to look like meat.  I find meat repulsive.  I'll have a veggie burger with fake bacon, and can you serve it to me dressed like a cow?  I don't like meat.  I just like to call meat late at night and hang up.  Let's drive by meat's house.  Does meat ever ask about meat?  I don't care. 
[03:14:30]  I ain't missing you at all.  Missing you.  Never see that the other way.  I will have the steak, and can you make it taste like tofu?  My wife refuses to eat meat, because she feels it's cruel to animals, which, interestingly  enough, is the same reason why I don't eat vegetables.  I'm a vegetable rights activist.  Except for the potato. 
[03:15:00]  They can't feel anything.  I do love animals.  I've never looked at a cow and thought, I want to eat that.  But once that cow is slaughtered, drained of all its blood, chopped up, and put on a grill,  I get hungry.  Mmm, cow.  Definitely helps if it doesn't look like an animal.  This ham sandwich doesn't look like a pig to me.  But ribs, you know, there's no getting around ribs.  Because they're ribs. 
[03:15:30]  It's amazing how casually we order.  You know, I will have the baby back ribs.  And can you wheel that out in a stroller?  I'm going to start with the baby chicken legs.  I'm going to have an all-baby meal.  Hey, buddy, I used to be a baby.  How do you eat ribs without looking like a caveman anyway?  Excuse me while I tear the flesh from this bone.  I need the energy for when I club you later on. 
[03:16:00]  I like all kinds of meat.  Even bologna.  I knew he was white trash.  I don't even know if bologna is a meat.  I don't think meat's supposed to catch on fire like that.  What's interesting about bologna, it's not just a meat, it's an insult.  That's a bunch of bologna.  You're full of bologna.  It kind of implies bologna makes you lie. 
[03:16:30]  I eat bologna all the time.  Or maybe I don't.  Maybe that's just the bologna talking.  Have you seen the bologna that has the olives in it?  Who's that for?  I like my bologna like a martini.  With an olive.  I love the bologna sandwich.  Dirty.  Everything about bologna is silly. 
[03:17:00]  Who decided on the pronunciation of the word bologna?  All right, how do you want to pronounce this word?  Bologna!  I don't know if you saw.  There's a G in the word.  I don't see no G.  Bologna!  Okay, well the word does end with the name.  We're going with bologna!  Trust me, I came up with colonel.  You ever been reading and come across the word colonel?  You're like, colonial.  Someone important.  This reading's hard. 
[03:17:30]  Where's my TV?  Ah, busy show today.  Opie and Anthony.  Kurt, come on in.  Our old friend Kurt Angle is here.  Ooh, they're loving Kurt.  Where the hell have you been?  It's been a long time, man.  Nine years.  No, not that long.  Are you kidding me?  Nine fucking years.  It's been about seven or eight, yeah.  Here you go.  Oh, here's an old picture of you with us. 
[03:18:00]  I remember.  I remember.  No, you don't remember.  It's okay.  Oh, yes, I do, man.  I was there when you guys did all that crazy-ass stuff in Boston here in New York.  I've been through it all with you.  He certainly has.  I remember when you and The Rock got in a little quarrel.  Oh, yeah.  I remember everything, man.  And I told The Rock, oh, yeah, well, we're going to be bigger than you.  Oh, that sure didn't work out.  Yeah, what are you going to do?  I think he just finished his tenth movie, you know, and we're still doing the same old 
[03:18:30]  crap.  Me too.  We have no problem.  Now he calls up and he promotes every movie he's doing.  No, you guys, when I was there, you guys, you know, evened it out.  Everything was cool.  Yeah, we settled it up.  Yeah, we settled it up.  We're cool now.  Yep, yep.  Yeah.  So, what are you, TNA now?  Yeah, yeah, man.  I wanted to get a new start.  Yeah.  I had to give my body a rest, but, you know, TNA's grown so fast, thank God, that I haven't 
[03:19:00]  had much of a rest.  I've kind of gotten to the same sink I was in the WWE, but it's better now because I serve  a much bigger purpose in a smaller company, you know?  Right.  We just broke, first time, this past five weeks, we broke two million viewers.  That's huge.  Oh, really?  The company's only, like, five and a half years old.  Right.  You know, it's young.  Yeah, I know.  I remember when that first started out, yeah.  You know, so, compared to WWE right now, we're light years away, but, you know, I can  see it within the next few years being like WCW and WWF was. 
[03:19:30]  Are you allowed to be Kurt Angle, or did you have to change your name to Bert?  No, no, no.  They do.  Bert Angle.  They trademarked everything, you know?  Anything I use, the Angle Slam, the, you know, the It's True, It's True, you know,  I'm not allowed to say any of that stuff, but they can't trademark your real name.  Right.  Thank God, yeah.  So, you can't say-  Look at the Lone Ranger, you can't wear his mask.  Clayton Moore couldn't wear a Lone Ranger mask when he got inside, he had to wear sunglasses.  Right, right.  So, even though you invented It's True, It's True, you can't use that-  They trademark it, yeah.  With your new company.  Yep.  Exactly. 
[03:20:00]  Wow.  Damn.  That's crazy.  Yeah.  You're not allowed to say it, or say it in the same tone that you used to say it in,  or as a-  No, you can't say it at all on TV, especially on the show, you know, but you know what,  there are, WWE's always been cool about, you know, I'm still getting royalty checks that  blow my mind.  I mean, they still take care of you, you know?  So, I don't have any hard feelings toward WWE, I just wanted to slow up a little bit and  not wrestle as much, and, you know, I don't have any hard feelings toward Vince, him and 
[03:20:30]  I had a falling out, but we made peace, and everything's cool.  What was the falling out about?  I really don't know.  Being overworked, I was injured, I broke my neck four times, and I needed to get some  out.  I love how he just, how do you breathe by that?  I know, just casually, laundry list of things, but I broke my neck four times.  And you know what?  With a hammy.  Right, right.  But he was going to give me, and finally, you know, when he finally listened to me,  he released me for, you know, he said, go ahead and take six months off, come back, you 
[03:21:00]  have the same contract.  And I thought, wow, he's releasing me, and he's going to bring me back, but why would  he release me?  So I thought, it's a good opportunity to get out for good, go to TNA.  So that's what I did, I called TNA, and you know, it worked out.  Do you think he would have taken you back?  Oh yeah, he'll take me back now, yeah.  Yeah, he'll take me back, I mean, there's no reason not to, but you know, I'm happy  with TNA, it's a lot of fun, and it's fun helping a company grow. 
[03:21:30]  I can't even remember the last time I won, but that's my job.  My job is to help make the other guys bigger stars.  Oh, you're not, oh really, is that what's going on over there, Sam?  Sam knows everything.  About wrestling, that's why I mean, you sit with the big boys today there, Kirk.  Well yeah, Kirk's part of the main event mafia.  The main event mafia?  Yes.  It's a new little, you know, gang kind of thing.  All the big guys.  I mean, he's one of the biggest stars in TNA.  Hence the suit. 
[03:22:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Is that it?  Yeah, yeah, we all wear suits.  You wear the suit.  Exactly.  Yeah.  I'm the godfather.  Who's part of the group there?  Well, you got Kurt Angle, of course, and then Sting.  Sting, sure.  Booker T.  Booker T, okay.  Kevin Nash.  Kevin Nash.  Diesel.  Scott Steiner.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  The main event mafia.  What?  What?  What?  Primetime Sam Roberts?  Primetime, maybe, as a manager or something like that.  Yeah.  See, he likes to call himself Primetime Sam Roberts.  That's his wrestling name. 
[03:22:30]  We'll make you an honorary member.  It's not that I like to call myself that.  It's what people started calling me.  Sometimes his nicknames go down.  Sorry.  You know, damn, I forgot that.  He corrected you, Ryan.  Yeah, the people.  You don't have full control sometimes.  Douchebag Sam Roberts didn't have the same ring to it.  He wrestles in high school gyms locally.  Oh, you do?  Well, I've never actually wrestled.  Well, you jump in the ring.  I've gotten in the ring, though.  And you punch people in the balls and stuff.  He gets in the ring and doesn't look like he's selling anything. 
[03:23:00]  What are you talking about?  You just, you didn't.  I'm sorry.  You didn't sell it to me.  I was just looking like, oh, boy.  My favorite Sam managing video was when Sam had a, he did the run-in.  He did the all, the all, great equalizer.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And then didn't know what to do after the fact, so he just kind of stood in the ring.  You can't just stand in the ring Primetime Sam Roberts.  It was all awkward.  It was like, do I go now?  He didn't know.  The referee came at it the wrong time.  Oh, you're blaming it on the ref who came at it the wrong time. 
[03:23:30]  Oh, he was an old man.  He didn't know what he was doing.  That's it, Sam.  You got to love Primetime Sam Roberts.  It's a very successful show for the New York State Wrestling Federation, as a matter of fact.  Two-time Sam Roberts.  New York State Wrestling Federation.  It's N-Y-S-F.  N-Y-S-W-F.  Oh, jeez.  But could you put more letters in there?  Yeah, yeah.  It really rolls off the tongue, you dummy.  I didn't name it.  Sam, by the way, let it be noted that the guy now just turned the camera back on. 
[03:24:00]  So we just started talking, and he turned the camera off to save, I guess, on battery power.  Yeah.  That makes you feel good, huh?  My father, Primetime.  Glad you pointed that out.  Waste of time, Sam Roberts.  This is what they call you now.  People have insisted.  I'm going to be on TV.  No.  No.  I don't think you're going to be.  Kurt, what do you say about the rumors that surfaced about you and the WWE?  What was it?  With some pills or something.  Oh, the pain pills.  Geez, man.  That was four years ago. 
[03:24:30]  I'm sorry.  But we haven't talked to you in a while.  I just want to make sure you get your side of the story out.  No, no.  You know what?  You're going to get the complete, both sides.  What happened was, you know, I broke my neck quite a few times.  I was asked to go to a doctor.  Went to the doctor.  I started taking painkillers and started at one, then two, then three, and four.  And before I knew it, it wasn't really helping the pain.  So you can get addicted after one prescription.  And before I knew it, I was the sixth, then I was at 12, and then I was at 24, and then 
[03:25:00]  it was like 40, then 65.  Jesus.  Wow, really?  I had extra strength Percocet, you know, or extra strength Percocet.  So it got so out of control that I knew I had a problem, and I knew I had to present  it, and I did.  The only problem was I wanted to go to the rehabilitation, and I was told that I could  do it on my own while wrestling full-time on the road, because I was an Olympic gold medalist.  That's what really got me upset about the whole situation, was I was in a lot of trouble. 
[03:25:30]  I knew I was.  You knew you couldn't do this on your own, and you were out there on the road.  But I did.  Oh, you did?  I did.  I had no choice.  Wow.  I did on the road.  And you know what?  I don't blame Vince McMahon for me taking the pills, you know, although they set up, you  know, they wanted me to go to this doctor, make sure my neck was taken care of.  But, you know, I took them myself, and I'm the one that got myself addicted.  I just needed help getting off of them. 
[03:26:00]  I didn't get that help.  So it was a lot of praying.  I was in the hotel rooms, different hotel rooms every night.  It took me about five months to completely get through the withdrawal.  And I'll tell anyone out there, if you get addicted, get help right away.  Do not wait.  Do not think you're going to go a couple more months, and then, you know, and then you can  start weaning off of them.  The best thing to do is to wean off of them.  But I told my doctor, I'm quitting cold turkey.  He said, you might die.  You go from 65 extra strength a day to nothing, you could die. 
[03:26:30]  I said, I don't want to touch them again.  Did you go to detox at all or in the hospital?  No.  No, you just spread it out?  No, actually, I had a match literally two days later.  It was a 40-minute match with John Cena, and I was at a pay-per-view.  And, I mean, I could barely move, and I got in there.  But, you know, Vince McWay was right.  I did do it on my own.  I just wish that I really wish I could have gone because I think I would have been able  to, I wouldn't have went through so much turmoil and pain if there was a lot of pain involved. 
[03:27:00]  And that stuff, you don't mess around.  I haven't taken one of them in four years.  I never will again.  What do you do now, though?  It's weird because, I mean, I'm in recovery, like, drinking and drugs, and, like, there's  a certain thing where I can't mess with medications, but I'm not a martyr either.  Like, if I've had a surgery and you have to take something for it, so what do you do if  you have a legitimate injury and you got it?  You have to take something.  Suck it up, man.  Take the pain.  Yeah.  You know what?  Motrin, I just cannot take painkillers anymore. 
[03:27:30]  I know what it did to my family.  I know what it did to me.  I could have died.  And, you know, wrestling's getting a bad name for it, but when it really comes down to it,  it's the individual.  You know, not every wrestler's taking painkillers.  As a matter of fact, 95% of them aren't.  But it's that 5% that gets addicted.  And then, you know, probably three or four out of those 5% end up dying from an overdose. 
[03:28:00]  You know what it is?  When you're in a business where you guys get hurt and you can make that pain go away by  taking pills, it must be tempting, you know, like you said, for the guys that are out there.  But I've, for four years now, I've worked my ass off.  And I didn't need it.  I don't, I really did.  I never needed them.  I made myself believe in them.  Especially to that extent, right.  So, you know, the same percentage of wrestlers are the same percentage of people that are doing the same thing in every profession. 
[03:28:30]  Even doctors.  5% of the doctors, they're taking painkillers, okay?  Even radio.  5% of people in radio, they're taking painkillers.  A lot more than 5%.  Right.  I'm just saying, you know, but wrestling is the only one that got crushed over it, you know?  Right.  So, it's like, you know, I guess because, you know, a lot of fans, you know, a lot of attention on some of these big stars. 
[03:29:00]  And you've got to remember, most of the guys that died are from that late 80s, early 90s era, the drug era.  Yeah.  Where they partied hard and they worked hard.  They had two-a-day wrestling and they were popping pills, drinking alcohol.  And when they retired, they never stopped.  They just kept going.  And so, like, 99% of the guys that have passed on are from that era.  It's got to scare the hell out of you that these guys are dropping.  But the thing is, the kids today...  We just lost Tess, what, a week ago?  Two weeks ago.  He was a lost soul.  God bless him. 
[03:29:30]  I agree with that.  But the kids today, the guys I work with, their idea of a good time is to go back to the hotel room and play video games.  Okay?  It's a completely different...  That's kind of what's happening with rock and roll, too, when you go backstage and see these guys with their veggie sandwiches and their green...  It's changed, man.  It's changed, yeah.  I think it's for the better, man.  I really do.  You keep them out of trouble and, you know...  But I see a whole new different era.  And so, I think professional wrestling, sure, took a hit for a while. 
[03:30:00]  But I think it's going to start...  You know, it's always in cycles.  Yeah.  It's going to start making its rise again, thank God.  And, like, we've had our highest ratings ever the last five weeks.  Yeah, you're doing all right with the TNA thing.  Yeah.  What about the steroids?  I don't touch them, man.  I did.  I did.  I admit.  I did.  Yeah, that's what I want to get into for a second.  I'm not going to make an excuse.  I went...  An Olympic athlete.  Broke my neck.  Right.  Broke my neck.  Sent to a doctor.  Doctor said, you lost how many inches in your arms?  I said, well, I can't feel my hands.  And I lost about three inches on both arms. 
[03:30:30]  And he said, well, you have something in your neck that's blocking the nerves into your  arms.  And you're not getting blood in your arms.  And the only way that you're going to be able to continue to wrestle is if we put you  on a medication, some kind of steroid, testosterone, whatever it is.  So I did that.  And I did it legally.  Right.  Okay.  But I was nervous because I never did that before.  I was an Olympic athlete, never touched that stuff.  So I waited about six months.  Right.  And finally, I was like, my neck is not working out, my arms, I'm not getting my size. 
[03:31:00]  So I started taking it.  When I got drug tested, I had to write scripts for it.  But the doctor said, these scripts are overdue.  And I said, what are you talking about?  Scripts don't die out.  He said, yes, they do in one year.  So I happened to be...  My scripts were one month late.  So I got suspended for taking something that I got prescribed.  Right.  And I was scared of taking, but I ended up taking.  Right, right, right.  And so it's no excuse.  I did take them.  I'm not going to pull a pro baseball player thing. 
[03:31:30]  I did it.  Yeah.  And I had a reason for doing it.  And I got caught doing it.  But at least I could say I got it legally prescribed to me because of my neck.  It's obvious to you that all the baseball players were doing it in the steroid.  Yeah.  You know what?  I don't blame them.  You've got to remember that a lot of people in society today tell me they didn't want to  see Mark McGuire break that record.  Oh, yeah.  That was about it.  You know, we talk about that all the time.  You want to see these monsters just slamming the ball over the wall. 
[03:32:00]  That's it.  Yeah.  And you know what?  They all broke the records and they probably couldn't have done it without steroids.  It's noticeable that the wrestlers look a little smaller, too.  Without a doubt.  And you know what?  What hurt at first?  It probably did at first.  It's going to hurt for a little bit.  It's like when the body of us, when they tried to make it steroid-free.  Nobody watched.  You know, these guys lost 50 pounds of muscle.  Everybody's like, this guy looks like a normal person.  Yeah.  You know?  And then they said, okay, let's stop the drug testing. 
[03:32:30]  And all of a sudden, they're back up to 350.  You know?  They want to see freaks.  I mean, we all do.  We want to see.  So they look the other way.  Yeah.  They're the only sport that pretty much looks the other way officially, right?  They still have random testing.  Yeah.  Quote, unquote.  I don't know.  I don't know a lot about it.  But I will tell you this.  They got some big sound of bitches.  You know?  So, you know, we have a drug program that we follow.  We get drug tested.  And even though TNA is a private company, it's not a publicly traded company, you do have to go through. 
[03:33:00]  They will suspend you.  So, you know, WWE's done a tremendous job.  They have actually taken a step further and have given anybody that has been employed by WWE, you can go to drug rehabilitation anytime, anywhere, whenever.  You know, if you do become addicted even after you wrestle, Vince McMahon's given you the opportunity to go to rehab.  He'll pay for it.  Right.  I think that's an amazing feat.  That's a good step.  It is.  And I'm glad that Vince McMahon did that.  I think it showed a lot of poise. 
[03:33:30]  And, you know, if there wasn't a WWE, there wouldn't be a TNA.  We're both going to feed off each other, you know?  So, I'm very proud that Vince McMahon did that.  I think it's going to help a lot of future wrestlers, too.  Man, you've been through a lot.  Kurt has been through a lot.  I've been, yeah, I've been bashed and I've been crushed.  Breaking the neck four times.  Yeah.  My God.  Five, including the Olympics.  I broke my neck right before the Olympics.  What about the MMA rumors?  There was rumors about you fighting in the MMA and then the whole thing with you and Liddell.  I mean, was that something that was real? 
[03:34:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I still, you know, I still am considering it.  I've actually, you know, people say, oh, Ang was full of it.  But I am, I'm not allowed to really talk about it.  My first priority is TNA right now.  But will you see me in the octagon?  Yeah.  Wow.  I can't tell you when, but you will see me.  I can't tell you which company.  It's, it's, there are a lot of things that I can't say, but I will say that I will fight eventually.  Because you're, I mean, you're a real, like, you're a legitimate wrestler. 
[03:34:30]  I'm 100% healthy right now.  You can really fight.  But Liddell said something.  It was in response to something you had said.  I have a lot of respect for Chuck Liddell.  He said that he's.  Am I scared of him?  Hell yeah.  Okay, because he said that you've never, he said, because you had said something which  I guess bothered him.  And he goes, well, he's never been hit as hard as I'll hit him.  No, no, no.  Jesus Christ.  All I said is that I would give him a good fight.  And, and, you know, he was trying to say that I couldn't take him down.  You know, I want to go to the Olympics.  I, I know he wrestled in college, but, you know, to me, he's, he's a little peon as a wrestler.  But he has power. 
[03:35:00]  I have a lot of respect for Chuck.  As a fighter, he's one of the best ever.  I would never put him down.  I have a complete, the utmost respect for him.  But if you got him on the ground, you could do some damage, yeah.  Yeah, I think anybody could do damage.  Chuck knows that.  Anything can happen at any time.  There's such a difference between.  Chuck's a great fighter.  I have a lot of respect.  Him and Randy Couture and Tito Ortiz, those guys really, you know, watching him fight,  I, I, I got excited.  You know, I wanted to do it.  I've seen Brock Lesnar, a guy I used to mix it up with in the WWE. 
[03:35:30]  Yeah, he got in there.  We used to wrestle in, in the ring.  We used to go at it hard, you know.  And, uh, Brock's a great wrestler and look, look at him now.  He's one of the top guys.  But now when you look at it and you see like, uh, Olympic wrestling and then, uh, professional wrestling.  Yeah.  And then something like, uh, extreme fighting, uh, uh, uh, mixed martial arts.  Uh, how would you, you see that you can't really have any one style anymore in that.  Uh, you think that would affect you?  You think just wrestling would be able, you'd be able to pull off? 
[03:36:00]  No, no, no.  I, I, I've already trained MMA.  Oh, you have.  I've become a good striker.  Really?  Uh, a lot of it's defense.  You got, you got to become very good at defense, striking.  Uh, defense to submission.  A lot of those jujitsu guys are very tricky.  Um, I, I know that you have to become a well-rounded fighter.  Because it used to be just, you know, you get the, one of the Gracies in the ring years ago.  And the guy was, you know, whoever's fight was done.  Oh, you just tie you up and you're done. 
[03:36:30]  Now you can't, you got to kind of know a little bit of everything.  You have to know a little bit of everything.  And you know what?  I'm not going to become, uh, this great knockout, uh, submission wrestling machine.  Because, uh, I'm not going to be able to learn enough in, in, in that short period of time.  Uh, I think I'll become a well-rounded fighter.  But when it comes down to it, uh, you, you need to use your strengths and your weaknesses.  You got to work on and make sure that you don't get caught in a situation where Chuck, he has a great right, right, right hand punch. 
[03:37:00]  I mean, he can knock anybody out.  Yeah.  And he throws it wild.  And you, and there, there's a way he does it.  And there, there's a reason he's built the way he is.  And the reason that he does what he does.  And, uh, you know, someone like Chuck Liddell, as dangerous as he is, you got to remember, that guy can knock you out at any time.  I punch him.  The defense has to be there.  What weight would you fight at?  If, let's say, speculation, you ever did it, what, what, what would the weight would be for you? 
[03:37:30]  Would you be a light heavyweight or heavyweight?  Believe it or not, I could, I could fight at heavy, light heavy, or middle.  Because a guy like, uh, heavyweight, like.  I'd be all three.  I'm about 220.  I can, I, I, I range between 220 and 230.  I get to, down to 205 and today.  And I, I could suck down to 185 if I had to.  Because Lesnar's obviously a heavyweight.  Lesnar's huge.  He's 270.  And Fedor, who's, what, he wrestled, what, Sambo?  Sambo.  Sambo.  That's his thing.  What's the difference between that and the, and the wrestling?  Sambo is wrestling with submission. 
[03:38:00]  Okay.  So that's kind of, that's kind of like what, what, what regular traditional wrestling is here,  but it's got that jiu-jitsu submission.  It has submission with it.  Yeah.  Sambo is, a lot of wrestlers back in the day, in the 60s, 70s, early 80s, used to do both  wrestling and Sambo championships.  And, um, basically it's, it's wrestling takedowns, you know, getting a guy on his back, going for  submission holds.  Uh, Fedor is very good at it.  He takes a lot of pride in it.  So he will not quit.  Dana White, you know, guys like him in UFC, you cannot become, you can't, you can't compete 
[03:38:30]  in one sport and also do his.  Dana wants you, uh, you know, just, just to do UFC, just to do MMA.  He won't, he doesn't want you to do, you know, like if he, if Dana White, which we haven't  talked or anything, but if he came to me and said, listen, I want you to fight, he would  say you have to quit wrestling.  Well, I'm, I'm, TNA is my top priority.  This is what I do.  Uh, I can't stop wrestling.  You know, I can't, I can't just tell him, Hey, uh, can I do both? 
[03:39:00]  He'll tell me no way.  You can't be a pro wrestler and an MMA guy.  You either do one or the other.  You can't do both.  That's what he's telling Fedor.  You can't do Sambo and come here in UFC.  I need you to be here.  Dedication to one thing.  Do you realize like, uh, uh, with, uh, WWE, um, and I respect that from Dana.  I really do.  I think if Dana's honest, if he's nothing else, boy, he is a fucking brutally honest guy.  He's a great guy.  He's a good friend of mine.  He's a great guy.  Yeah.  With, with WWE, you realize when you're going through like personal shit and stuff like 
[03:39:30]  that, uh, who your friends are and who aren't, I mean, do you still have a good  relationship with some of the guys or no, really, really, you know, I, uh, Pat Patterson  once told me, he said, find out how many people you keep in touch with when you retire.  Let's just say I didn't retire, but I left WWE, uh, within two months, I was keeping in  touch with one person out of all my friends up there.  Now, nobody who was the one person.  Jesus.  He ended up with TNA.  His name's, uh, his WWE name, his name's, uh, Sheik Abdul, but, uh, uh, he's, he's, 
[03:40:00]  he's always obviously.  No, the thing is, it's, it's so odd because like obviously riding high with the WWE, I  mean, uh, every week, all your friends.  Yeah.  And, and, and there's that camaraderie that looks like it transcends just the show, uh,  that there's gotta be some kind of relationships that, that, uh, you have, uh, backstage.  You have it until you're done and then you go back to your family life and your family 
[03:40:30]  and, and, and you, it just, you lose touch.  You know, everybody lives in different places and, you know, you're lucky if you live in  Tampa because there's so many wrestlers that live there, you know, you might keep in touch  with more guys, but nobody else lives in Pittsburgh.  Is it just the way it is or is there like animosity towards some people or not other people?  Really?  He said, see how many friends you end up with.  He, Pat Patterson was telling me that he had none.  He doesn't keep in touch with any of his friends and that, you know, I, I, I thought he was 
[03:41:00]  full of it.  And then when it happened, I was like, damn, he was right.  Who were you most surprised at?  Was there one guy that you were like, fuck, I thought I'd keep in touch with him and it  wound up not happening.  Um, you know, you know, there are a lot of guys, I mean, uh, but, but I kept in touch as  long as I could, but it's just that they're doing their thing.  I'm doing mine.  And that's a stone cold and the rock.  Uh, but you know, obviously those guys are still, you know, they're in Hollywood, they're doing  movies.  They got their own thing going.  Uh, so I don't blame them for that.  Um, it's just, uh, you know, Dwayne Johnson is now, you know, on the peak of his acting 
[03:41:30]  career and stone cold is actually doing movies too.  And, and so, uh, you know, those two guys were some of my closest friends, but, uh, that's  just what happens in pro wrestling.  You know, if, you know, right now I have close friends in TNA and, you know, Kevin Nash  and, and, and, and the Dudley boys and, you know, uh, well, but if I retire, when I  retire, I guarantee, you know, God bless them, but I, I, I probably won't call them or text  them anymore.  I'll move on with my life. 
[03:42:00]  Yeah.  That's kind of true.  It's almost like stupid radio.  That's what, you know, it's really stupid radio.  It's kind of the same.  It's like you leave a company and then you, people that you're with every day of the week,  you just don't see them anymore.  Except fucking stupid Ron and Fez.  We see them all the time.  Yeah.  It's fucking albatross around our necks for years.  Those guys, they're so needy.  They just, we keep getting them fired and they keep following us.  What's wrong with those two?  No, I think it's, I mean, I think it's with whatever you do in life.  Yeah.  I really do.  I remember having the going away parties at radio stations like Ant was saying and these 
[03:42:30]  people were like, oh, we'll keep in touch and do that next time in New York, blah, blah,  blah.  We haven't seen those guys in 10, 12 years.  It is.  On occasion you do though, kind of make friendships that, that kind of go outside the business.  Yeah.  Uh, but a lot of times you are kind of surprised that it's like, wow, that was kind of just business,  you know, that's what happens, man.  I, I, and I know wrestlers like that.  Uh, I know a lot of professional athletes that retired from their teams.  They, you know, they, they, you, you see them, these reunions, like, you know, 10 or 20 year 
[03:43:00]  reunions or 30 year reunions from when they won the Superbowl and none of them have ever  kept in touch.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The first time they say, Hey, how you doing?  Big hug.  I wonder if that's, that makes it harder, uh, when you retire from something like wrestling,  um, whether it's an injury or, or just time to get out, uh, if it makes it harder because  you really don't have anybody to commiserate with.  No, without a doubt.  Do you know any of your college friends still?  You keep in touch with them?  Uh, never went to college.  Grammar school friends.  Grammar school.  But, uh, no, there, there are a couple of friends that I still have from high school. 
[03:43:30]  Yeah.  But, but I mean, just two actually, Adam and Joe Curry.  That's, that's about it.  Yeah, I have one.  Uh, yeah.  And, and, but, but those kind of, they never went away.  It wasn't like you kind of lost touch and then came back again.  Right, right.  It just always been around drinking beers on the weekends and shit like that.  But, uh, other people, yeah, you just, they just go away.  So, yeah, it's gotta be, it's gotta be rough though, especially trying to get through something,  whether it's an addiction, an injury and stuff. 
[03:44:00]  And you really don't have anybody to reach out to.  No.  You gotta do it yourself.  Yeah, you're right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And it's, it's, I've been there, been there.  Sam's the big wrestling expert.  Did we cover everything?  I'm trying to make sure we cover everything.  You said there was some rumors that you were, Sam was kind of pushing.  Yeah, let's tell them about what you were telling us.  The rumors about, and I don't follow wrestling, but you, you were talking about the rumors  of, uh, uh, of the, the female wrestler that he, that Kirsten linked to, and you were  saying that that was probably true?  Well, yeah, well, I've heard that.  That's what they say on the internet anyway.  Oh, the internet. 
[03:44:30]  Oh, that whole internet thing.  That'd be a factual information on that internet.  But this is why I come to the source to ask the question.  What, Rocco?  Yeah, so you said that he thinks it's confirmed for a fact.  Yeah, I dated her.  Uh, you know what?  I will say, uh, she's one of the most genuine people I ever met.  Um, a lot of rumors about her, uh, on the internet.  There's completely, uh, false accusations about her taking advantage of, when, when I was  dating her, that she was taking advantage of the situation.  Uh, we have a lot of, a lot of, you know, women are women in this business and they, uh, 
[03:45:00]  you know, sometimes it gets a little cutthroat, you know, she, uh, she was one of those girls  that actually was, she was the tall girl when she was little, it got picked on and she was  always very nice and she's the same person now.  And a lot of girls are taking advantage of that situation, you know?  Uh, so, uh, she's just got a good heart and very Christian girl and, uh, and she's beautiful.  You've seen her.  Yeah, absolutely beautiful.  She was tall, black girl, beautiful, gorgeous, not that gorgeous, but very good person.  And, um, anyway, but, uh. 
[03:45:30]  You went out with her because she's a good person?  She was really good.  No, she was really a good person.  She was, yeah, yeah, in many ways.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  She was, she was good in the sack.  And that, there you go with that.  See, he's being honest.  But that leads to the next question.  Your marriage broke up, huh?  Yeah, yeah.  You know what I mean?  Dad joined the club, bunch of bitches.  Exactly.  You know what?  I got my wife in the business and it went downhill.  Yeah, because the last time we talked, you were married.  I think you got married in 98. 
[03:46:00]  Yeah.  Somewhere around there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So.  Yeah, you know what?  I'm not going to point out any of these.  But you got her in the business and you think that was the, that's when it started going  downhill, you think?  Yeah, I think that's when the ideas came off in her head and, you know, she began to meet  new friends and, you know, sometimes wrestling, you know, people are your friends, sometimes  they're not, sometimes they're feeding your partner's information or they're saying things  or giving her ideas of, hey, what if you were single, maybe this could happen, you know. 
[03:46:30]  I would have, you know, I, she became an overnight star on TV on our show and I don't know if  it, you know, if it enhanced her reasons for getting a divorce.  I'm not sure why.  It came out of nowhere.  Wow.  I was on the road and I got a text.  Jesus Christ.  Can we talk about this when I get home?  A text.  That's where I got home.  What did the text say, I'm not happy or it's time to move on or I'm, I need.  Pretty much.  I think you just said the exact, did you read it?  Yeah.  Jimmy, Jesus Christ.  I've gotten enough of those. 
[03:47:00]  So, and then I came home and she said, I want a divorce.  And I was like, can we go to counseling or anything?  And she said, hi, I want a divorce.  And the next day she gave me part papers.  It was that fast.  Wow.  She had it all planned out.  There was a reason.  Yeah.  I don't know yet what it is.  There is a reason.  I will find out eventually.  She did a heel turn on him.  Oh, yeah.  Heel turn.  Exactly.  So was there any, but there's no one that showed up in the picture right after it.  Like, oh, that's why.  Like sometimes you, someone breaks up with you and all of a sudden they're dating someone  two weeks later and you're like, that's.  Yes. 
[03:47:30]  I, uh, you know what?  I've made some guesses and I'm probably right about them, but, uh, I don't want to make  it really official.  Yeah.  Cause I don't know for sure.  Just things that you kind of might've noted and suspected.  Yeah.  I'm not an idiot.  Yeah.  So, uh, but.  You know what?  Uh, good for her.  You know, I just, I have two kids and, and I just want to make sure they're taken care  of and that, uh, that we don't lose sight that we have two kids and we have to get along.  That's it.  I have no problem with who she's dating, what she's doing, as long as the two kids are taken  care of.  And, and we protect our children from whatever personal relationships we have on the side. 
[03:48:00]  You know, translation.  The kids are too young right there.  Translation.  Kurt Angle is doing quite well on the side.  Well, that's also a good message to any potential guys out there.  You're not going to play dad to my kids yet.  That was, that was also, don't think you're going to step in and start filling shoes.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Are you a jealous guy?  Would that drive you nuts?  No.  To see, to see that?  No, no.  I'd be happy for Karen if she got, you know, if she got, uh, if she had a new boyfriend  or she got remarried. 
[03:48:30]  Uh, I, I want her to be happy, but at the same time, you know, my kids are my kids and,  uh, no, they're not going to be calling the next person daddy.  I'm, I'll make damn sure of that, you know, so it's just, uh, I, you know, uh, I'm sure  she wishes I would just wash up and die, but, uh, it's not going to happen.  You know, she'd like to take my money, my fortune and, uh, and take my kids and probably,  you know, leave, but, uh, I'm not going anywhere.  So you have pretty good feelings towards her.  You seem like you're pretty diplomatic. 
[03:49:00]  I don't have any problems with her.  I don't.  She has shitty feelings towards you?  No, I just, you know, I, I just think that, uh, she thought it was going to be a,  you know, a lot easier for her to, you know, get rid of me and, and move on with her life.  Um, you know, it's, it's one of those things where I just, uh, I, I have too much love for  my children to just say, Hey, you know what?  Take care of the kids.  Here's, here's her money every month.  Here's a big lump sum that you can take and, and move on with your life.  Uh, no, here's what I'm going to pay you, but guess what? 
[03:49:30]  I'm going to see my kids and I'm going to be a part of their lives.  You know, I'm not going to, I'm not going to be a deadbeat dad that just pays somebody money.  Money isn't enough.  You got to be a father.  You got to be there for your kids.  And I, I'm not going to, I'm not going to risk that by having her want to move to another  state.  She moved to another state.  I'm going to, I'm going to follow her ass there and live there.  Are you, I want to see my kids.  Are you allowed?  Cause a lot of times when people, you know, with these kids involved, you're allowed to  kind of both have a say over where the other one goes just so the kids aren't, you know,  say a three hour flight away.  Are you able to kind of say, look, no, I don't want them going there. 
[03:50:00]  Do you have any say in it?  No, I don't.  Uh, unfortunately, um, I'm hoping that she stays where we are because I'm very happy  where I live.  She's very happy where she lives.  She has her parents live.  They live a quarter mile away.  I bought them a house across the street from me.  I made this as easy as I could.  So hopefully God willing, she understands it.  I set this up for a reason and she can move on with her life.  I don't care about that.  I'm so glad I didn't have kids.  Oh, am I so glad.  I know.  Just get rid of, I got rid of, and that was it. 
[03:50:30]  Didn't have to say boo except in a courtroom.  You did right.  Yeah.  10 years of payments later, you're fine.  Yeah, exactly.  I would never, I would never say that I wish I didn't have my kids, but I know this,  did I have with the right person?  Nah, nah, nah, but I'm glad they're here.  Thank God.  Yeah.  I love them so much, but I believe that they would have been with somebody.  They still would have been the same kids.  It would have been with somebody else.  You know, I, you know, like I got in a fight once and I said, we shouldn't have had the 
[03:51:00]  second kid.  She's like, Oh, you're saying we shouldn't have Cody.  I'm like, that's not it.  He would have been born.  He just would have been with somebody else.  Yeah.  You know, I am glad he's here.  You know, he's part of my life.  I love him so much, very much.  But, you know, in a real world, we should have gotten divorced a long time ago when,  when we, this is our third time.  I mean, we were, you know, so.  Third time was splitting up when you guys just split up and got back?  Yeah, yeah.  It's the third house I bought her.  Wow.  So.  You realize sometimes so late, you're like, what the hell was I thinking? 
[03:51:30]  Why did I stay in that?  Both of us are, you know?  And the thing is, but I have two beautiful kids.  I don't regret having them.  I'm just saying that I could have had them with somebody else.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, it's, but they're here and I'm glad.  I, I don't regret it.  So.  Wow.  I told you my whole personal life.  Nice.  I was going to say, you know something?  Yeah.  It's just refreshing to get open and honesty.  Yeah.  On this, on this goddamn show because everybody just lies like a sack of shit.  They come in and they don't want to, they don't want to say anything.  It's like.  Prime time Sam Roberts, by the way, lies about his steroid use. 
[03:52:00]  Yes.  Look at him.  That's right.  I never touched his stuff.  Look how pumped up he is.  I don't touch it.  It's not good for you.  It's not good for you.  It's not good for you.  It affected his hair though.  His hair is steroids.  Did you know they made it for, to make it good for you?  Did you know steroids were made to help people?  And they just hurt.  Did you just not hear me?  Like, there are people out there suffering from like cancer.  Or suffering from muscle atrophy from a disease.  And they made steroids for a reason. 
[03:52:30]  Now I'm not saying, I, I, I was taking them because of a medical reason.  But I'm not, I'm not, I'm not making an excuse.  I also like being jacked.  Okay.  But there are a lot of people abusing it.  But steroids weren't made to abuse.  They were made to help.  I was saying steroid use is helpful.  Steroid abuse.  There you go.  There you go.  I don't like the lack of respect.  I don't think he said that.  I know.  I know.  Yeah.  I don't like the lack of respect he's showing for, for Kurt Angle.  Downtown Sam Roberts and Kurt Angle, I see, I see maybe future, uh, match here. 
[03:53:00]  A grudge rape.  You want, you want to come in?  Hey, we got lockdown coming up.  We, we even have, uh, Danny Bonaduce is going to be in it.  Uh-oh.  Oh, man.  Oh, someone just hit him in the head real hard.  You know what?  That's what he said.  He said, I just want to get my ass kicked.  I said, oh, that will happen.  Something's on me.  That will happen, Danny.  Yeah.  He, he likes being punished in life.  Yeah, yeah.  He's a little, he's a little, yeah.  He makes, something's going on there where he thinks, you know, I should just be punished 
[03:53:30]  for everything I've done.  Please beat me up.  He's not a pussy.  I'll say that.  Bonaduce is not afraid to mix it up.  He wants to beat the shit out of Dennis Rodman.  I have no idea why.  I guess he did a show with him, a reality show, and, uh, he's like, I don't want to.  He did well with Jose.  There's always somebody he wants to beat up.  He did well with Jose.  He's like, I'd back his knees and I'd gouge his fucking eyes out.  He's like, just saying stuff like that.  He's an angry guy.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's a martial artist, isn't he?  Like, Danny's a fighter.  He's not a, he's been taking martial arts for years.  He's a tough kid.  He's a tough kid, yeah.  Because he's a red-headed, he was fucking the kid, he probably got picked on. 
[03:54:00]  Partridge family.  And he said, fuck this.  Danny Partridge.  Yeah.  Danny Partridge just kicked your fucking ass.  Now, how do you feel?  And Llobass is jacked up, too, man.  Did you see him lately?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  I was no mistaking what he was doing for a while.  Some abuse.  Some abuse.  Abuse.  Sam Roberts.  What do you think about steroid abuse?  That is hurtful.  That is not good.  Right.  And someone like Danny Bonaduce on television, that's not a message you want to send to kids.  Kids are watching him.  See, it's all about the kids with you, right?  It's just the worst. 
[03:54:30]  It's true.  God, do I want to push that chair over?  I mean, it's real.  I just want to push your chair over.  I understand what the problem is.  God damn it.  Kurt, I couldn't be happy.  Very, you know, congratulations on the gig and everything.  Sounds like things are going great.  It's going well, man.  I can't complain.  Tell Mick Foley we said hi.  I will.  You know what, Mick?  Mick, Mick, Mick.  He comes in every time he's in New York.  I told him I was coming here.  Yeah, he told me.  He said he loves you guys.  Mick's a good shit, man.  He really is.  Yeah.  He's also another guy that's brutally honest, you know?  He'll tell you like it is. 
[03:55:00]  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So what are we promoting?  We got the TNA Impact Thursdays at 9 on Spike, right?  Then you got TNA Lockdown.  That's the pay-per-view.  April 19th.  Oh, April 19th.  Okay.  Sunday, April 19th on pay-per-view.  Yeah.  And it's TNAWrestling.com.  Yes, it is.  Sam likes it.  Yes, I do.  Hey, it's right down in Philly, too.  We're at Temple University, their arena.  So hopefully some people in New York here can head down there an hour and a half drive  and just, you know.  Make the trip.  Yeah, yeah.  Without a doubt.  Check it out.  Mick Foley fighting for the world title. 
[03:55:30]  Sam Roberts will be gone.  I'm sure.  I'm sure.  Prime time Sam Roberts.  I hope they don't give you a ticket.  Prime time Sam Roberts.  I like that.  Yeah, prime time.  Please don't like that.  Foley shouldn't be.  Foley's got to stop wrestling.  He kills me.  He does.  Our buddy's got to stop wrestling.  You know what?  Did he retire?  What is he doing?  He's got a hunger.  Yeah, but he's got a hunger for it.  We love that guy.  We don't want him to get hurt.  The thing is, not only that, but here is Mick again.  Guess what he's doing.  You know what the whole thing about this pay-view is?  It's every match is in a cage. 
[03:56:00]  Oh, no.  You know what's happening?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's going to get on top of the damn cage.  He can't.  Take a 40-foot bump off into a table.  So, you know, this is like the worst thing he could actually do.  No, I mean, I can't just fight in a cage.  No.  He's got to get all over it, fall off of the goddamn thing.  I'm through it.  Yeah, yeah.  I know what happened.  His kids took his posters off their walls.  So now he's like, oh, yeah, I'll show you.  Look what daddy can still do.  His kids got like the Jonas Brothers posters up there.  He's like, man, you're not kidding.  He brought that up to me.  He told us. 
[03:56:30]  Yeah, yeah.  He's not happy that his kids don't look at him as that wrestling hero anymore.  Yeah.  Best-selling author.  Yeah.  Nothing means anything.  Yeah.  Did you see when he got hit in the head like 14 times by the rock and his kids were in the  front row?  Oh, yeah.  And he was handcuffed and bleed.  I mean, you know, Mick, he might not want to take the kids to the lockdown.  That might not help them mentally or psychologically.  Here's the other problem.  His kids are all grown up and he's still trying to push that Christmas thing on them.  Him and his Christmas rules. 
[03:57:00]  Enough of Christmas every day of the year.  That's creepy.  Right.  It was fun when they were four, man.  Your kids are now dating.  They're going to proms.  I'm down at Disney with my kids, right?  Yeah.  My wife and I, when we're married.  Yeah.  And somebody comes up to me and says, hey, Mick Foley comes down here.  I said, hey, oh, that's great, man.  He brings his family.  They said, no, he comes by himself.  That's creepy.  Some of it goes on rides by himself.  I mean, Mick is, whoa.  Oh, that is creepy.  Yeah.  By the way, this is, we love the guy. 
[03:57:30]  I do, too.  I love the guy.  This is why we love the guy.  We beat up the guys we love.  I want to ask Kurt one thing, too.  What did you think of the wrestling?  Did you like it?  Oh, yeah.  How did you portray the wrestling?  A-plus, man.  Mickey Rourke did great.  Marissa Tomei.  I thought the story of the movie, you know what?  It really showed like a side of, you know, like Jake the Snake, someone like him.  Right, right.  What he has gone through.  Right.  You know, and God forbid where he is headed.  You know, the end of the movie was the big splash, but you didn't know what was going  to happen. 
[03:58:00]  Yeah, yeah.  You know, obviously, a lot of things have happened, those wrestlers back in the 80s  and early 90s, and, you know, God forbid it continues.  But like I said, wrestling is different today, but that is the exact what wrestling used to  be.  Did it make you sad when you saw that at the end, the way the old wrestlers were kind  of like forgotten in a certain way?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know what?  It just, I knew that guys have gone through that.  And, you know, with me, my life won't be over when I'm done with pro wrestling. 
[03:58:30]  You know, I'll probably end up coaching or doing something, you know, because of the  Olympics and winning Olympic gold medal.  But I can see these guys, you know, they never had any other education.  They've been wrestling, pro wrestling since they were 14, got their shot when they were  25, you know, became popular.  And then they had their fall from fame and, you know, addicted to something.  And bang, here they are doing these small shows to make 50 or $100 to survive.  It's like, oh, man, I pray to God it doesn't happen. 
[03:59:00]  You know, it's just a lot of these guys made a lot of money and then spent all of it and  lost it, you know?  Yeah, yeah.  I'm not saying all of them, just a handful.  But it just, you know, when you see Jake the Snake and guys like that, it's like, man,  this guy had everything.  And he just gave it all away.  He was huge.  Just drugs and, you know, crack and cocaine.  Seeing Jake bothers me a lot.  Yeah, because you know what?  I loved him as a fan.  I just thought he was real.  You think that was the biggest influence for Mickey Rourke's role, Jake the Snake?  Without a doubt.  He mirrored him, yeah, to an exact. 
[03:59:30]  I mean, it was amazing.  Yeah.  Yeah, you're right.  I mean, he took a lot of different wrestlers, but it was like, that looked like more Jake  the Snake than anyone.  Trying to get his daughter back.  It just shows, like, what happens when you're on the road and you put your career first.  It was like the aftermath was just the uglier side of, you know, none of the main events,  just the uglier side of trying to survive afterwards.  It was a really great, depressing movie.  It was.  It was depressing.  The whole damn movie was depressing, but it was good.  It was good.  I give them an A-plus for it.  I thought they did a tremendous job.  The writing, they were directing. 
[04:00:00]  I mean, the film was only, what, $12, $15 million?  Yeah.  Maybe.  The budget film, you know.  I can't imagine how much they made.  They made over $100 million, right?  Oh, sure.  Why is Chris Jericho snipping at him?  What's going on with that?  I don't follow it, but is that real?  No, no, no.  That's the WrestleMania.  They're trying to get Mickey Rourke involved.  And, yeah, I think it's a, you know, it's pretty cool because he was up for the Academy  Awards.  So, it's something, you know, Vince McMahon, he always has to bring in a celebrity.  And this is pretty cool.  It's the right timing.  Okay.  You know what?  I want WWE to prosper. 
[04:00:30]  They prosper, we prosper.  It's a, you know, you scratch our backs, we'll scratch yours.  And you know what?  You're going to see talent jump and ship.  It already has happened.  Me, Booker T, Mick Foley.  I mean, it's just, and guys have gone back.  Christian Cage, he went from TNA over to WWE.  So, you're going to see a lot of that, you know.  We're now going up head to head.  Vince seems a bit on the sick side.  So, what I want to say, and I'm leaving Kurt out of this.  But I'm thinking if you go to the TNA and then come back to WWE, I think he'd get hit 
[04:01:00]  a little harder.  How do you think at first, man?  Oh, I think the bumps are a little harder, man.  Christian came back.  I can't do Vince's voice, but you know backstage, he's working the guys like, all right.  Give him hell.  Give him a little extra for me.  I believe that.  I believe that.  And I've seen him do it with WCW guys that came in.  Really?  Did he bring him in margin life and then squash him and rebuild him?  Vince is good at it, though.  You know, he's done it to a lot of guys, but he is good at making stars. 
[04:01:30]  We had guys at TNA that were never above opening card.  He's made them into main event.  Yeah.  Household names.  So, Vince is good.  We like his new...  Welcome back.  We're going to drop a Buick on you.  That's how it starts.  We're going to drop a Buick on you.  That's how a bitch pays cash, too.  Like, he wants to smash a car.  Yeah.  So, go get me a car, 50 grand, whatever, and bang.  You know, he's going to pay cash.  I can see that.  I mean, Vince is cool.  Yeah.  Just for a show.  We love his new bit where he, what, gets hurt and goes away for six months. 
[04:02:00]  Comes back six months later.  First time out, he's hurt again.  Right.  You think the ambulance takes him away and he's in the Caribbean somewhere for another  six months or whatever the hell he's doing.  Whatever he's doing.  He looks younger than he did six months ago.  Yeah.  What are you doing?  You know what, though?  He never...  I'll tell you this.  He never stops working.  No?  Yeah, yeah.  Pat Patterson had to move to Florida because he couldn't be with Vince anymore.  Vince is 24-7.  Yep.  Even when he was getting a haircut down in New York City, he had to drive from Stanford, 
[04:02:30]  Connecticut, to New York City just to get his haircut.  Pat had to go with him so they could do the writing.  They'd do it all day long.  Vince doesn't just stop.  I don't get my haircut in Connecticut.  I can see him just driving to New York.  Right.  Jesus.  That's Vince.  Yeah.  That's fantastic.  Everyone else is inconvenienced because he has to get a trim.  Our friend wrote a little for us thing.  Do you know Patrice O'Neal?  Yeah.  Oh, you do know Patrice?  Yeah.  I hope you say no.  Yeah.  Patrice is great, man. 
[04:03:00]  All right, we should get Kurt out of here.  No, thanks, guys.  Thanks for having me, man.  Kurt, very honest interview.  We're very...  Fantastic, man.  Thanks for coming by.  Good to see you guys.  It's good to be on again, man.  Great to see you guys.  Been way too long.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Without a doubt.  Hopefully, I'll come back on a lot sooner.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Been nine years.  I don't think we'll be here at nine...  Nah.  I mean, well...  I mean, well, not me.  All right.  I think we're wrapping up for today, too.  So, Kurt, thank you.  Thank you, guys.  So, man.  Plug again.  TNA Impact Thursdays at 9 on Spike TV. 
[04:03:30]  And then the big pay-per-view, TNA Lockdown, Sunday, April 19th.  You can go to TNAWrestling.com for all those details.  Thanks, Sam.  You were great.  You were great, Sam.  Thank you.  It was amazing.  Prime time.  Prime time.  Prime time, Sam Roberts.  They call me.  That's what they call me.  No, you call me.  You've got Jake's last name in there.  It works perfectly.  His dream is to work for some wrestling company full-time.  For real.  Good luck to you, man.  Thank you.  Oh, well.  See, I was trying to say, sit down there.  See what happened?  Good luck, bro.  I can put in a good word, man. 
[04:04:00]  I can promise you that.  I think he's going to do it.  I think he's going to do it.  Why don't you wait for that?  Hold your rub. </pre>
