<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with E-Rock and Sam Roberts hosting a “Worst of 2008 Cringiest Moments” segment.  This featured extensive clips of Opie’s embarrassing early career as “Spuds Buckley,” a bizarre radio persona from his Buffalo days, culminating in near-firing.  The segment transitioned to a humorous recounting of Anthony’s date with news reporter Jill Nicolini (Anthelini), played as a phone call where Anthony detailed excessive wine consumption, implied intimacy, and his subsequent task of driving Jill’s cats to be neutered. Mick Foley was present in the studio during this segment. The segment concluded with a shocking “hot candle wax shots” stunt involving E-Rock, who willingly endured hot wax poured onto his body in various sensitive areas, resulting in visible reactions and much vulgar commentary. A listener’s reminder of a show rule about repeating segments with offensive language led to a second round of wax application for E-Rock.

The broadcast continued with a deep dive into the tumultuous aftermath of Anthony and Jill’s 20-22 hour date. The hosts, along with Anthony’s friend Keith, recounted the volatile breakup, including Jill’s discovery of another woman in Anthony’s closet, her subsequent seizure of belongings (demanding $500 for dry cleaning and a new camera), and the subsequent “hostage exchange” where Keith retrieved Anthony’s things after delivering $1000.  Further details emerged about Jill’s new boyfriend being present at the exchange, her employing a computer forensics expert to examine a broken laptop, and her alleged burning of the other woman’s belongings, including a birth certificate and grandfather’s ashes.  Anthony voiced concerns about vehicle tampering and his American Express bills, and the hosts speculated about the whole incident being a PR stunt.  This segment included reviews of previously aired segments related to the “Anthelini” saga as part of the year-end “cringiest moments” review.  Highly offensive language was used throughout this segment.

Next, Anthony read emails from Jill detailing his alleged infidelity and extravagant spending on her,  which he countered with his perspective and accusations of her own actions, including the burning of his belongings and misrepresentation of events.  He also revealed his spending on her clothes.  The discussion included accusations of lying from both sides, details of infidelity, and discussions of Jill’s alleged cosmetic procedures.  Anthony expressed significant anger at Gene Simmons, alleging harassment of Jill and a subsequent denial of knowing her in a show interview.  The segment also touched on a grease stain on Anthony’s bedsheets attributed to Jill’s weight-loss medication, and speculation about Jill’s possible prior knowledge of a fire at Anthony’s favorite restaurant, Mio.  Comedian Bobby Lee appeared as a studio guest, but the segment ended abruptly with Bobby Lee experiencing a panic attack and leaving.  Highly offensive language was used throughout.

The broadcast then shifted to a series of bizarre events.  The show began with Bobby Lee, already present in the studio, experiencing growing distress due to a shaking studio, a potentially hazardous crane outside, microphone malfunctions, and a cockroach infestation. His anxiety escalated into a panic attack, leading him to leave. This was followed by a pre-recorded, awkward interview with David Tyree,  filled with uncomfortable moments.  The main event was the “Baby Diaper Mustache” stunt, where listener Voss arrived with a dirty diaper, prompting Opie to apply its contents to his face as promised.  This resulted in a chaotic scene with Opie visibly distressed, Bobby Lee vomiting repeatedly, and general disgust and amusement from the hosts and crew.

The final segment focused on another “cringiest moments” review, including an in-studio interview with Seth Green. Sam Roberts brought his girlfriend, Jess, a huge Seth Green fan, who participated in the interview, her straightforward questioning style proving humorous. Jess openly stated she would leave Sam for Seth Green, leading to playful banter about relationships and celebrities.  The segment also included clips from previous broadcasts, featuring interviews with Black Sabbath (described as rambling), Gene Simmons and his son (with humorous tension noted), Denzel Washington, and Burt Reynolds. A significant portion was dedicated to the recurring bit of tasting and smelling tongue scrapings from various studio guests, resulting in gagging and vomiting.  The show concluded with a humorous advertisement for audiobooks narrated by a homeless man.

We're not even going to try. 
[00:08:30]  You're going to be fucked all day now.  What's your bullshit, really?  And Ron and Fez.  I got one guy gagging, the other guy fainting, and then a retard.  It's the Ron and Fez Show.  Hiya, buddy.  I'm the virus.  XM 202.  Sirius 197.  The virus is an XL channel which may contain explicit language.  Channel blocking is available by calling 1-800-XM-RADIO or in XM-Canada, 877-438-9677.  Hey, it's Opie and Anthony welcoming all the new subscribers. 
[00:09:00]  Hello.  All the new suckers.  Joining us after turning on their new XM and Sirius radios.  Describe the show a bit.  Well, it's a little bit of this, and then we do a little of that.  And we throw in some la-la-la-las.  Thanks for checking us out.  This is the worst of Opie and Anthony.  See, this describes it better.  Just play this.  Yeah.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony, 2008, cringiest moments. 
[00:09:30]  I am E-Rock, and joining me is primetime Sam Roberts.  Yes, Sam here from the Opie and Anthony show, as is E-Rock.  And we are going down some of the cringiest moments in 2008.  And what that basically means is the moments on the Opie and Anthony show that made you cringe the most.  And what are we starting off with?  Well, E-Rock, Opie had a radio career before he was Opie.  No, he didn't.  Yes, he did.  Really? 
[00:10:00]  Quite a varied one.  And in 2008, we met Spuds Buckley.  And for the first time, he played the bit in its entirety.  This is Opie debuting the entire Spuds Buckley tape in front of Anthony, Jim, and the radio audience.  Was it good?  It was great.  And that's what I cringed at.  All right.  How good is it?  I'll take your word for it.  Let's listen to it.  It's Spuds Buckley on the worst of Opie and Anthony's 2008 cringiest moments.  It's Opie and Anthony's worst of 2008 cringe moments. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah.  I'll look back at some of the most uncomfortable yet hilarious portions of the show.  Three, two, happy new year.  Happy new year.  It's Opie and Anthony's worst of 2008 cringe moments.  Happy new year.  Way before Anthony and I did our famous April Fool's prank that got us fired the first time.  Oh.  My second radio, by the way.  Mm.  Um, cause we all got fired when we were working in Buffalo back in the day cause they, you 
[00:11:00]  know, were bought out.  But anyway, um, Spuds Buckley didn't save the day.  No.  There was a, there was a morning show, the bear man.  He's now heard in, um, Allentown, Pennsylvania.  Morning bear man.  And, um, his April Fool's prank was to, to come up with a parade and then people would  call the, the, the station like, wow, where's this parade?  It sounds cool.  I want to, I want to check it out with my kids.  Well, the gag is there was never a parade, but it sounded like there was an actual parade 
[00:11:30]  going through Buffalo.  And I was part of that bit that day.  Ooh.  As Spuds Buckley.  I thought Buffalo's home of quality.  Rock and Rolls.  636.  Gracious.  Good morning.  Uh, you're on your way with the bear man.  We got the whole Fox crew.  We're here at the, uh, excuse me, at the, uh, reviewing stand, uh, on the, for the first,  uh, annual Fox Fool's parade.  We're located just, uh, one half mile west of Furman Boulevard near Shooters.  And they're still working on, uh, kittens.  So you get the location and all of a sudden people show up and like, hey, where's the 
[00:12:00]  parade?  And there's sound effects like they're building a reviewing stand or something.  Is that what they're doing?  Or a float?  What are they building?  Yeah.  As you're on it.  What is this animal house?  Yeah.  Yeah.  What is the hammering in the background?  Unless it's Spud Buckley, Spuds Buckley's head.  We're creating an illusion.  Spud Buckley.  All you need is a hammer.  Stink.  Uh, sound, you know, hammering a nail in and you create an illusion.  An illusion.  Yes.  Theater of the mind.  That's right. 
[00:12:30]  Furman Boulevard near Shooters.  And they're still working on, uh, getting some of the, uh, getting some of the, uh, barriers.  Some of these vendors we got over here, they want to know where the hell they're supposed  to be.  Vendors, vendors, vendors, vendors.  Who's, where's, oh, let's look at it.  Well, la, la, la, la, la, la.  All right.  Listen.  Oh, I was like, no, no, no, no.  You got it.  You got it.  I can't.  You got it.  I can't.  Yeah, I know.  Please.  I want.  Please.  Bobby, yes.  Just relish in it.  Please.  Please.  Please.  Opie, for the love of everything, that's all.  He pushed that button.  What happened?  That was, you heard two seconds of Spuds Buckley and now you just want to hear as much as you 
[00:13:00]  can.  You haven't heard Spuds Buckley yet?  No, but did he have a hat with a propeller on top?  See?  It was that type of character.  I didn't, I didn't create this character be like, cool.  Oh.  It wasn't, uh, getting me the Buffalo Bettys.  You were like, uh, the nutty professor.  Like, like one guy was like, la, la, la, la.  And then the other one was, uh, Buddy Love, the, uh, the crooner. 
[00:13:30]  You had buck teeth in your pocket and Chinese, like Asian guy glasses?  Dude, I'm, nah, let me tell you something.  La, la, la, la, la.  And I would do a lot of stuff out in the streets and I, uh, I, I was too poor to get  the, uh, the proper outfit for Spuds Buckley.  So I would just like, like come up with stuff.  I have sweatpants, I, you know, and, uh, white basketball sneakers and the sweatpants  are, uh, tucked into the white socks that are pulled up pretty high. 
[00:14:00]  And then I got the, uh, the station jacket on cause it is Buffalo and I'm freezing my  ass off.  And then I have like, uh, like a do-rag on.  And are you making a la, la, la, la, la, la face?  No, I'm just, I'm doing a, uh, what's up, man face.  Oh, my God.  All right, let's play this.  Two Swerzo.  What's it going to be?  Well, la, la, la, la, la, la.  Oh, no, no.  Good morning, Bearman.  Ladies and gentlemen, put them together for Spuds Buckley.  Put them together. 
[00:14:30]  Two mallets with his head between it.  You have to stop.  My ears almost fell off.  The two shivers just went up my back.  It almost shook my ears off.  Right?  Yeah, I, uh, you gotta remember, I was making 12 G's.  This is, I'm being polite.  12 large, huh?  I'm being polite.  This was at least, at least 15 years ago.  No, about 15 years ago.  You sure have been making Governor Spitzer prostitute money to degrade yourself like that.  Uh, and I actually, uh, was, well, I told the story. 
[00:15:00]  I was supposed to show up at a really nice outdoor, like, uh, club in Buffalo at Spuds Buckley.  And I'm there, and there's all these, like, you know, these hot chicks and guys trying to pick up the hot chicks.  And then I was supposed to be, like, the entertainment and do a couple things and sell some beers.  And I sat in my car and basically cried and said, I can't do this.  Cried?  I can't do this.  Dude, I have suffered in this business. 
[00:15:30]  And I never showed up.  And it was a big client.  I believe it was, like, Budweiser or something.  I mean, it was a huge client.  And I almost got fired.  And then I actually, I actually did cry in the general manager's office.  I'm like, look.  Oh, my God.  I, you can't fire me.  I just couldn't do this.  I, I was, I was mortified.  You had a life-changing moment in the, in the car.  In New York as Spuds Buckley?  In my Honda Accord that had close to 200,000 miles on it.  Did you go home?  In the parking lot of this really hip club that I was supposed to, like, make this big appearance as Spuds Buckley. 
[00:16:00]  Did you go home that night and take the outfit off and fold it up and put it in a suitcase and put it up on the top shelf of a closet?  I think that's how this whole character ended.  I don't think I did it after that.  Because I just, I just kind of petered out.  Because the salespeople, they'll sell anything.  They're like, oh, this Spuds Buckley character.  Apparently.  We got to, we got to have them doing appearances all over Buffalo.  And the first one, I sat in the parking lot with my dumb, awful outfit that, that I had next to me on the passenger seat.  And I'm like, I can't do this. 
[00:16:30]  I will not do this.  And I'm pounding the steering wheel.  My life sucks.  I'm 400 miles away from home trying to make something of myself in radio.  And then it got back to the GM.  I didn't show up.  And rumor had it that he was just going to fire me flat out.  And I actually had to let the tears flow to make sure I didn't get fired.  You used the bitch get out of a ticket strategy.  Hell yeah, man.  Not only did I not get fired, I got a raise.  You got a raise?  Yeah, because I told them how down on my luck I was. 
[00:17:00]  Making no money, you know, far from home.  I was collecting change to eat.  But anyway.  I like that he's pulling on a heartstring.  I know.  He's trying to get some sympathy now.  He's giving you some background on this dumb thing.  I don't care if you cried in your car and you couldn't eat and you had to go down on people  to get a meal.  You did spuds.  La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.  Good morning, baby man. 
[00:17:30]  Do you want to hear more or what?  Come on.  Not only do I want to hear more, I have to.  All right.  Here we go.  I'm here to make a buck this morning.  Spuds, when aren't you here to make a buck, huh?  Hey.  So do you have your vendor permit?  Uh, yeah.  All right.  I'll trust you, okay?  Okay.  Now, you're going to be vending up and down the parade route today?  I'm going to be selling fudgy wudgy bars this morning.  Oh, Bobby's leaving.  Bobby just got up. 
[00:18:00]  Bobby!  He's physically leaving.  Bobby!  Bobby just left.  That means we can't play anymore, I guess.  He's leaving.  Too bad.  I was willing to give you another 30 seconds today.  And he left.  He left his studio, and I can't.  I need to hear more because, like I said, I want new spuds, Buckley.  Everything so far, I've heard already.  I need just something a little new.  Well.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I had to go punch something.  Bobby, why do you think I'm, like, the biggest dick?  Because I've been through the freaking ringer in this business. 
[00:18:30]  Oh, wait a minute.  E-Rock's got a spuds, Buckley song?  What?  We represent the lollipop cheer, the lollipop cheer, the lollipop cheer.  Wow.  Sounds just like him.  Yeah, you might laugh, but, you know, I was the inspiration for Spongebob Square Pants.  That is true.  Yes, Drew.  I could have been making Spongebob Square Pants money.  You've got to play some more.  I need new spuds, Buckley, for the next break. 
[00:19:00]  Oh, yeah.  See?  Just in case you thought I was lying, listen to this.  Uh-oh.  Many years later, this is what was going on in pop culture.  I was on to something, my friends.  Yeah, you were on.  La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.  See?  That's from Spongebob Square Pants.  Yeah.  I was on to something.  Yeah, you were.  About 10 years later, all of a sudden, they're ripping off Spuds, Buckley.  Where's my residuals?  I need residuals. 
[00:19:30]  Why do you think I'm a dick, dude?  I've done it all in this business.  His aunt knows I freaking had to sit on the side of the Long Island Expressway at a gas  station pumping a $1.02 gas and handing roses to fatties for Valentine's Day.  I've done it all.  I've had it.  I've done the Jell-O wrestling in parking lots and stupid kiddie pools.  This is such a back story of how Opie became Opie.  Absolutely.  And I was the guy, oh, you don't mind. 
[00:20:00]  Let him work every holiday.  Oh, God, that's why I'm a dick, if you really want to get into it.  I've seen it all, my friend.  Get into it.  I had to do two for Tuesdays, and I had to get the lead out.  And I did mandatory Metallica.  And I did the four-play weekend where the fourth cut is always live.  That was me.  Of course it is.  Who do you think was spinning the tunes for your block party weekend?  Me!  Who ran the 5 o'clock funnies? 
[00:20:30]  Me!  5 o'clock, I've done those.  Freeway jam?  Yeah, the 5 o'clock traffic jam.  Traffic jam, yeah.  Where you get some jamming tunes.  That was me, Bob!  He's having a nervous breakdown.  That's why I'm a dick.  Let's go to Jason in Carolina.  Jason, what's up?  Hey, poor Opie, he's gone through all this radio hell.  And what was he doing a week ago?  Rubbing baby crap under his nose.  Nothing's changed for you, man.  Nah, that's true. 
[00:21:00]  You're right.  I'm still Spuds Buckley deep down.  I'll always be him.  It's okay, Opie, relax.  It's okay.  It's okay.  It was just the beginning.  It was the way you got into, you know, the business.  Who do you think played the songs when we did the 9 to 5 promotion?  Listen to a song in the 9 o'clock hour.  Listen to one in the 2 o'clock hour.  Listen to the one in the 5 o'clock hour.  Be the 10th caller. 
[00:21:30]  And you win this crappy prize.  That was me!  I'm scared.  Very.  Done every dumb promotion available.  Very frightening.  Very frightening.  We still love you, though.  He's nervous.  Who started Led Zeppelin A to Z?  I started with the first song.  The Firecracker 500.  That was me!  Firecracker 500.  That's 4th of July or weekend, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Who do you think had a sleep at the radio station the 4th of July weekend? 
[00:22:00]  Me!  While you're out there barbecuing and drinking and picking up broads.  I had to make believe this Firecrack 500 thing was important.  Oh, guess what the number one song of all time is going to be?  Oh, is it going to be Stairway to Heaven?  Oh, maybe it'll be Freebird this time around.  That was me!  I had to make believe it mattered.  What?  Oh, he's throwing things.  He's all angry.  He's not even throwing things that won't hurt. 
[00:22:30]  He threw a coffee mug.  Oh, Jesus.  Big heavy Starbucks one.  It's a big heavy Starbucks.  But who threw that?  Who had to deliver the big six-foot heroes and the pizza to the office parks?  I actually did that.  I remember that.  I did that at BAB where I thought I was actually finally doing something with my career.  And one of my jobs was I had to get the six-foot hero and go to an office park in the middle of nowhere.  And all of a sudden I'm in this office and no one gives a crap. 
[00:23:00]  They just want the free sub.  No one knew who I was.  And I'm handing out T-shirts and ice scrapers.  And I see a kid I graduate with.  And he's like, why are you bringing me lunch?  And I'm like, oh.  Yeah, that's me.  Remember when I had this dream of going into broadcasting when we were in history class together?  Well, this is what it's become ten years later.  Well, like the guy said, though, I mean, you did make it.  You're on a great hit show.  Well, not back then. 
[00:23:30]  Well, right now, though, you made it.  It's just embarrassing back then.  Yeah.  Actually, you know it wasn't.  It was actually cool.  Honey, guess what I did today?  I went down to this big office park.  And I brought ice scrapers.  And everybody was glad to see me because it was icy out.  Because it was icy out.  Brought a sandwich.  And it was great because everyone was kind of hungry.  Dude, there was a crowd.  And I just threw T-shirts into them.  It was nuts.  They were going nuts.  And I'd wait.  And then I'd throw it.  And they'd go.  They love me.  Oh, they love me, man.  The guy gave me his card. 
[00:24:00]  He gave me his card.  He told me to give him a call.  He might want me to promote something as Spuds Buckley.  La, la, la, la, la, la, la.  Let me say hi to Lydia from Oceanside.  Hi, Opie.  Hi, Lydia.  You know, last time I spoke to you, you said you would never, ever see a therapist.  But I hear so much anguish in your voice about your past.  I wonder if you wouldn't reconsider.  So you think I need a therapist?  I'm just suggesting that, you know. 
[00:24:30]  Well, I think you need a big black dick up your ass.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  What's going on?  I certainly hope someone's being attentive.  I certainly hope someone's being attentive down the hall.  Opie certainly gave her a fine how-do-you-do.  Wow.  Where are we?  Uh, yeah.  Anthony, where are we?  Frequency modulation, Opie.  We are on frequency modulation. 
[00:25:00]  You must wait until this signal is beamed into outer space.  Yeah.  And returns back to Earth, cleansed in the atmosphere.  Yeah.  It's Opie and Anthony's worst of 2008 cringe moments.  It's time for hot candle wax shots.  Yes.  Now, I asked Dave on Saturday, or was it Friday, I guess?  Yeah, Friday.  Well, into Saturday.  I go, Dave, you want to take a hot candle wax shot?  He goes, yeah, no problem.  I'm thinking, eh, maybe his belly or his arm.  He pulls his pants down and insisted that he gets it in the crack of his butt. 
[00:25:30]  And then he proceeded, even though he was really hammered, to scream bloody murder,  frightening the people trying to enjoy their fine food at F.H. Riley's.  As we laughed and laughed.  Fell on the floor laughing.  Yeah.  Because then he had to dry wax up and down his butt.  He couldn't get rid of it.  It was on his pants.  It was all in his underwear.  It was just a mess.  So, E-Rock, would you take a shot of hot candle wax today? 
[00:26:00]  We've been burning candles all morning.  Sure.  There's three hours of wax in there.  I think it should go right on his belly.  Yeah.  Like, lift the shirt up and then just splash it.  Yeah.  Right onto his belly.  How about his bag?  Jimmy, would you do the honors?  No.  Because if there's a problem.  Why would there be a problem?  If he gets burned?  If we're throwing scalding liquid on somebody?  Eh.  Well, waxes, you know.  Oh, that's true.  I don't know.  You won't sue us, right?  We've got to get the, you have to, like, vocalize. 
[00:26:30]  You won't sue us.  No, I won't sue you.  There you go.  Well, good.  Mike, you're safe.  Give me an effing candle.  Thank you.  I'll do it.  You'll do it?  Sure, why not?  Don't miss.  Get a good one.  All right.  We've got to get a mic on, E-Rock.  Do you want to start with, like, small?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, E-Rock, by the way, I forgot to tell you, all three of us get to do it.  I'll pick the belly.  All right.  Like, I have multiple bellies?  Yes.  Why would that be?  You want a mirror? 
[00:27:00]  Is this a good one?  We've got a solid shot to shot and a half of hot wax.  He's waiting to be thrown on E-Rock.  Nice.  All right, here we go.  Lie on your back, E-Rock.  Is that mic on, Steve?  Testing.  Okay.  No, he doesn't lie on the back.  You throw it right at him.  No, it's you're lying on his back, so you're dripping on him.  No, he ain't dripping on him.  It's one of these quick, it's got to be like a quick just blast, the whole thing, right  on his gut.  Here we go.  E-Rock, take your shirt off.  Hey, take your shirt off, Hammer. 
[00:27:30]  All right.  Here he goes.  That's nice.  You know what?  We're kind of ready.  Yeah.  Hot.  He's got big pink nips.  Come, yeah, get over here.  Make sure it's no splatter.  Here we go.  I hope you should dump it on him because that way it doesn't come off.  Oh, it'll stay.  Okay.  Yeah, this will be ridiculous.  All right.  Close your eyes, E-Rock.  Oh, it's a little delayed reaction. 
[00:28:00]  Oh, ew.  That's what he usually says.  You got him right in the belly button.  It went, I saw it go in his belly button.  It went in his belly button.  Is it turning red yet?  Because it will turn all red and nasty.  And then it looks like you might have, you know.  Yeah, exactly.  We did flakes.  We did flakes.  How did it feel, E-Rock? 
[00:28:30]  Let's see.  It's turning red.  Yep.  I love E-Rock.  It didn't feel it at first, but as it started to leak into my belly button, it started to burn.  Nice.  Give me one.  I want to hit his back with it.  All right.  It gets to do a...  No, see, the splash is the best part.  You don't drip it.  You just have to...  I just didn't want it all wasted.  I wanted it to go out.  Oh, no, no, no.  Sure.  You could have dumped it on him, like Lane dumped it on him.  I wanted it all dumped on him.  What?  What's going on, E-Rock? 
[00:29:00]  Looks like I had an accident.  Wow.  The front of your pants.  Looks like you just saw a cheesecake.  All right.  Hold on.  E-Rock, get ready for the second shot.  Thanks, buddy.  Oh, that's going to be an awful one.  All right.  E-Rock's not going to be able to see it coming.  I did, like, a slow floor thing, so most of it would end up...  Look at his back.  It's all driven.  Wow.  It looks like...  Yes, it does. 
[00:29:30]  Yes.  Oh, if that doesn't look like you're in a bathhouse.  Yes.  E-Rock, can I throw one...  It's all sticky.  E-Rock, can I...  Is it?  Well, E-Rock, can I throw one on your throat?  How about a down-the-crack one?  How about me and Jimmy at the same time?  We have two left.  How about down-the-crack?  Yeah, can we do a crack and a...  Yeah, one in the front, one in the back.  Oh, my God.  Look at how red his belly is.  All right.  Give me one more, Dan.  I think he took skin off. 
[00:30:00]  No.  That's his belly button gunk.  Let's see your back.  I want to see how red...  Oh, yeah.  That one got really red.  Where, um...  The best thing I've noticed, it's better, instead of doing the wind-up, because, believe  it or not, from the time it leaves the glass to the time it hits him, if you're a distance  away, it has time to cool.  So, if you just kind of...  Jimmy, pull it...  It's a throw pour, almost.  Pull his pants out.  Pull his pants out.  And then pour it down. 
[00:30:30]  And pour it down.  He opened them up a little bit from the back.  Yeah, yeah.  Open up your belt.  Could we do a double to your, uh...  Get in your mic.  All right, let's hold to you.  And then right down there...  Um...  Oh, boy.  This is going to be bad.  Hold on.  No, you're right.  You got to bend forward.  Yeah, bend forward.  You got to bend forward.  Slide your jeans down.  All right.  Wait, wait, wait.  Yeah, get on the other side.  And tell us when.  Well, get...  Hold on, sir.  Get so you get a better view.  Point us for the when.  All right.  Let's see.  Hold on, hold on.  We're getting the cameras.  Everyone's in my way.  I can't see.  Thanks.  Okay, and go. 
[00:31:00]  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Did he curse?  Yes!  He dropped the F-bomb.  Oh, man.  That looked like a hurt.  And then he did, like, a cartoon run.  Like, on a cartoon character, there's butts on fire. 
[00:31:30]  Oh, man.  What's the matter, Iraq?  How's it feel?  It's like I wet my pants.  Wait a minute.  That does hurt.  He jumped.  Would you get some on you?  I just dumped it in my palm to see how it feels.  That does hurt.  There are guys that have a sexual fetish for that, where they want it, like, on their nipples  and on their penis.  They want hot wax drip.  I don't get it.  I know.  Iraq has the biggest crack, and we both just poured it right down the crack. 
[00:32:00]  He's going into the bathroom to tidy up the walk of degradation into the bathroom.  Oh, is that good?  Wow.  Too damn funny.  Oh, Iraq is a trooper, man.  He won't do anything.  Iraq is the best.  Iraq, come on out, because we've got to end the show.  Watch.  All right, well.  Uh-huh.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Another.  Iraq.  No, it'll. 
[00:32:30]  Oh, yeah, no, it worked.  The handle worked.  How does it feel, Iraq?  Oh.  Look at his underwear.  They're all, it's covered.  Covered in wax where his crack would be.  What a mess you are.  It looks like I dumped frosting.  How did it feel?  It's still, like, it's pulling hair.  Yeah, your skin's not stuck. 
[00:33:00]  Your skin's not as red, though.  You'll be all right.  Wax is actually not that bad for you.  People get dipped in wax.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Very good, Iraq.  Iraq.  You never disappoint, ever.  Ever, ever, ever.  We'll play the theme song to end the show.  Oh, what a way to end it.  Yeah, well.  That was good.  Oh, you know, Rob from Rhode Island makes a very good point.  Rob.  What's up, boys?  Hey, Rob.  Hi, Rob. 
[00:33:30]  The last time that you messed with Iraq and he cursed, it dumped out.  You guys had to do it again so you could get the radio play.  Yeah, you know what?  Oh, man.  It is the rules, Iraq.  You cursed.  So they didn't hear the reaction.  I do think.  And it is the rule that you've got to do it until you don't curse, remember?  He's going back to the bathroom with his underwear.  That's a good point.  He doesn't even question.  You know, we forgot.  Thank God.  Yeah, thank you, Rob.  Rob from Rhode Island reminded us.  Thank you.  I'm glad we have listeners with very good memories. 
[00:34:00]  That's right.  It is the rules.  Iraq dropped the F-bomb.  They had it dump out, so the listeners missed some of the fun and hijinks.  That's right.  Unless you got the satellite, you know.  Yeah, yeah.  But the reaction was great.  We want everyone to enjoy.  Of course.  Iraq's reaction to having hot wax dumped down his crack.  All right.  He's got his underwear back on.  Now, Iraq, if you could get us a reaction without cursing.  You're good.  No cursing, Iraq.  Why are you limping?  No, it's the underwear doesn't want to, like, form to my body anymore. 
[00:34:30]  Nothing does.  It's like wearing it with the cardboard.  Maybe rings.  What if you want to?  Now, all right, well.  It's got to be.  And why don't you do the honors with Jimmy?  Oh, no.  I like watching.  All right.  I'll do one.  Is there enough?  Yeah.  Well, I'm pouring wax from this candle into this one.  Ah, there you go.  I just had a half a shot.  There you go.  Do you want to put it in the microwave?  Nice and hot.  Yeah, can I microwave this?  No. 
[00:35:00]  That'll be tragic.  All right.  Remember.  Let me walk.  My funny walk to the side.  See?  Oh, that's a funny walk, Jimmy.  Now, Iraq, pull it down a little bit.  You were a little shy before.  A little bit.  Pull down.  A little bit.  All right, Jimmy.  Why are they so tight?  How about you?  Because I'm pulling them right now.  How about you open them a little bit?  Oh, hurry up.  My cable went out.  No, no, no, no.  No.  Don't move.  Don't move.  He smacked his face into the mic. 
[00:35:30]  He's bleeding.  Jeez.  Okay.  What'd you do, Iraq?  Give him one to the side.  Oh.  Ooh.  One more.  Jimmy.  I got one more, Iraq.  One more, Iraq.  Move the mic out of my face.  What happened?  You hit your nose on the mic?  You're damaging the equipment, Iraq.  What are you doing?  All right, he's trying not to scream.  His face is red. 
[00:36:00]  He's trying not to scream.  He's trying.  Oh.  You know what I'm going to give you on?  Oh, great.  Just curiosity.  I only have a couple drops in here.  Can I try one on your chest?  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Lay down on your back.  Hope, is there any left in there?  Here you go.  I'm almost out of wax anyway.  All right.  Well, there you go.  Oh, I feel like a little dominatrix.  Yeah.  That's right.  All right, Iraq.  Iraq, lay down there on the floor.  Lay on your back, slut.  Slut. 
[00:36:30]  Iraq's on the floor.  On his back.  All right.  I'm just going to try it.  Yeah.  Not on the face.  What's that?  Not on the face.  Not on the face.  Oh, boy.  I've never said that before.  All right.  There we go.  Pouring it on his nips.  Oh, it's in my armpits. 
[00:37:00]  Oh, hot wax rules.  Oh, was that pleasureful?  Oh, I got a little bit.  I dropped it on each nipple.  How did that feel?  That was the worst one?  It's tingly.  Yeah?  Oh, my God.  That was really good.  How was that good? 
[00:37:30]  Oh, black city.  Lamb, a lamb.  Oh, black city.  Lamb, a lamb.  She really hits me high.  Lamb, a lamb.  You know, that's no lie.  Lamb, a lamb.  She's so rock city.  Lamb, a lamb.

[00:47:30]  that was the anthony relationship that went uh across 2008 we just heard how the relationship started  the couple jill nicolini and anthony did end up going on a date they went out on a work night for  whatever reason and eric if you recall anthony didn't exactly show up for work at all no he did  the next day but in fact he barely if i remember right checked in before the show was even over  right wasn't answering the phone nobody knew where he was what he was well we had an idea what he was 
[00:48:00]  doing well he called steve at about or no no it was the night before he called steve around midnight  or one o'clock in the morning yeah obviously uh having a good time but saying oh i think i'm sick  i'm not gonna make it with jill laughing in the background now that there's um a key moment in  this uh this piece here where anthony talks a little bit about the restaurant that they went to  because um it'll come up a little later in as we tell the uh the saga of anthony well you know what 
[00:48:30]  that is eric no foreshadowing is it yeah and so this is uh anthony's call into the show it was 10 30 or  so before he finally called into the on a show that day uh after or during his first date with  jill nicolini so let's hear it on the worst of opie and anthony's 2008 craziest moments let's take a  look back at opie and anthony's cringe moments a selection of segments that'll make you stare at  the radio and say what the f was that holy crap yes you just heard what you thought you heard 
[00:49:00]  it's opie and anthony's cringe moments ladies and gentlemen he's in the middle of doing  the walk of shame it's anthony cumia hi hey buddy what's up anthony what happened you didn't come in  today yeah i was feeling a little poorly is the date uh officially over uh no 
[00:49:30]  now is this still a comfortable date or basically you just won't leave  yeah is the alcohol uh starting to wear off and you're both looking at each other  kind of awkwardly you're falling in love and she's getting nauseous  no it's amazing how well duct tape holds  so what happened man you texted me last night that you were a little it was very funny your text about  colin his scenarios were making you laugh yeah yeah well i was driving in and all i could think 
[00:50:00]  about was colin's horrific scenarios about how we'll we won't have anything to talk about except long  island and traffic right yeah and um well that wasn't the case what happened yeah well take us through  uh the date a little bit at least where like uh you got your hair did at uh john's hog and then what  happened uh then we um went to uh dinner at some place that that keith booked ah that um i i gotta 
[00:50:30]  tell keith i'm a little disappointed why i don't know it wasn't quite the intimate nice kind of  restaurant i wanted uh like there were tables pretty close to our table and a bunch of friggin old  ladies sitting there talking about their 1990 cell phones and how they don't work and it just wasn't  you know the atmosphere what kind of restaurant i'm in matt i think you went italian right of course 
[00:51:00]  of course we did went italian but it wasn't the type of place that you would have booked on your own  no not on my own no how would you should take it on a morton's how is the food uh  what food you don't know you don't know no um let's say i think i had two pieces of lettuce  uh-huh and jill had some cherry tomatoes and cheese uh-huh and then our dinner came 
[00:51:30]  but the wine was a little more important so you guys just looked at the dinner it sat in front of  us for hours as we just drank i was hope wine bottles how many bottles um two at the restaurant  and then one more somewhere else where where else did you drink the wine 
[00:52:00]  uh let me see in the car probably driving in the lia jill's house okay at jill's house  yeah that's that's so you guys got along well you were just talking about work and stuff and  yeah how was the conversation we were talking about work and um you know because we're both  broadcasters yeah yeah and when did you realize that you might be able to i mean i don't even know 
[00:52:30]  if you did but when did you realize that you might be able to sneak a kiss or like on the cheek  at least well well we're assuming too much jimmy i mean was there kissing involved anthony copia  i think we made a disgusting display at the restaurant oh my well can i why i showed a lot of restraint  my uh my pal uh i uh pictures i what and we have pictures are we going to be posting pictures  somewhere i don't know you guys you guys are heading toward a reality show maybe we we should 
[00:53:00]  film a reality show that we just throw up on our website little little uh vignettes with uh anthony  jill they already did that it's called the days of wine and roses  i uh wine and more wine i oh my god i just erased your text messages by accident because my phone  filled up oh my god i just lost the evidence and i was uh i was reading your text messages this morning  and i was putting blanks in uh very important places well i was just talking about how we were 
[00:53:30]  making a disgusting display of um you know public display of affection yeah they were uh you were  you it's safe just horrifying people we we didn't even notice like i wasn't looking around or anything  right i'm sure the old people were horrified right what was going on at our table so you guys were like  uh just having a makeout session right at the table yeah who kissed who anthony yeah how did that go down 
[00:54:00]  i don't know it was one of those like movie moments where you just kind of look into each  other's eyes and you know oh my god movie moment i i don't think it was a movie moment  try the wine yeah it was the wine  so did she only want to have a couple of drinks and then you just kept saying i'm pleased you appreciate  good wine actually uh she picked the wine right yeah she picked the wine and um wait wait uh it could 
[00:54:30]  say a lot about her what kind of wine oh yeah what is it i would imagine like it was like some nice  she probably picked uh like a california merlot  2004 2005 it was some italian wine wasn't it oh really yeah very nice so did you say anything  while she was eating her cherry tomatoes um yeah we were talking the whole time okay  yeah it wasn't anything like collins stupid fantasy of a disaster date were you concerned that she

[01:02:00]  cool to hang out with  she's a very  very cool girl  very funny  who said i love you first  so we got a little chemistry happening huh  she had me at the bqe is backed up  hey can we talk to her real fast  no  why  we won't ruin it  i don't want to have to remove the ball gag  we won't ruin it come on  no  come on  she really can't talk on the air 
[01:02:30]  why  just can't  she's not allowed to talk on the air  wait a minute  is she doing something right now  no  you asshole  why can't she talk on the air  she could probably say hi from a distance  all right  look at her  he's already protecting her  see this is going to change  when  when is this  no longer a bit  we're waiting for your  i  i officially don't think it's a bit  oh i know that  so now we're going to have to kind of like 
[01:03:00]  back off on some of the things we've been saying  we're just waiting for your lead  all right we got to hear her voice at least  because we don't really believe that she's still with you  that would be insane  could you just say hi  say hi off mic  okay  here we go  hold on  you hear that  yeah  not really  oh  hello  you heard that 
[01:03:30]  yes  yeah  so are you  oh she's in your house right now  yeah  and then you're heading out to  exit 68  for anyone that cares  to get the cats neutered  to get the cats  what  how does that come out  at the end of your first date  when you're both hung over  like  how does she say  look by the way  my cat's balls have to be cut off  are you in  well it was just  it was just one of those  uh  you know like i said  everything's being kind of compressed  somebody's a bit pee whipped 
[01:04:00]  24 hour period  yeah  all right  that's really uh  that's that sounds fun though  did you guys hold hands at all  like any intimate stuff  uh  hold hands  do we hold hands  yeah  i don't know  we're still trying to piece the whole night together  oh my god  they both blacked out  what was the first thing  that you said to each other  when  when you woke up together  i don't think they really ever slept  i think they probably got a few hours  maybe we'll snooze here 
[01:04:30]  no  remember i said something like  i wish these fucking phones would stop ringing  oh really  and she said  and she didn't turn around  and she said  please god let this be a nightmare  no she's  she's a very  very sweet girl  is she having fun  is she still enjoying herself  yes  and she wants to see you again  yeah apparently  uh yeah  definitely  did you get her panties 
[01:05:00]  bring your  bring your panties in tomorrow  oh uh the panties  yeah  yeah perhaps  what the hell was that  yeah perhaps  yeah perhaps that could happen  wait now let me ask you  you don't  just say this  when  when a certain person  saw a certain thing  on your body  yeah  what was the first word they used  yeah that's a good question  oh shit  was it wow  why are you saying oh shit  there's something else going on 
[01:05:30]  why are you saying oh shit  she's probably naked  in his favorite nazi hat  like woo  look at me  pointing his gun in the air  I'm the fun loving nazi  woo  why do you yell oh shit  nothing  something was said  that has to be kept  um private  say the  say what's happening  oh something she said  yeah  oh my god  uh  biggest ever  yeah  oh my god  was it something like 
[01:06:00]  let me say  was it  was it  holy shit  um  no  you could keep speculating  I'm not  um  was it  I'm not going to get into those details  wait was it  um  see I'm pretty good huh  yeah you did alright there Jimmy  well  what are you doing fan  I'm on a roll here  alright so uh  Anthony are you going to be in tomorrow  or  yeah  yeah  I think we both  uh  know that we  have responsibilities  as broadcasters 
[01:06:30]  and we will be back on the air  what is uh  what is channel 11 saying  about her missing work today  what's that  what is uh  channel 11 saying  about her missing work  um  you know  they understand  she had a long uh  night of drinking  and stuff  and  you know  she doesn't take a lot of days off  well Anthony did actually record  some of the date  and we're very happy he did  thank you for sending that uh  audio in  it kind of started slow  kissy on the mouth  and then it ended up with  this is a giant car 
[01:07:00]  hey uh  we got some fine detectives  listening to this phone call  and a couple people  are speculating  that you may be  in a bathtub right now  in a bathtub  there's a bit of an echo  going on  you know my house echoes  I'm just saying  what they're  they're saying  no we're not in a bathtub  yet  no not yet  the cats have to be neutered  oh yeah  I'm sure that's gonna happen  it is  they have to be 
[01:07:30]  taken to the vet  and neutered  well Jill actually  uh  it was  it was overheard  before on the phone  she got kind of  creeped out by Anthony  because uh  they  Anthony had whispered  something to her  he said  I can smell you a cup  so this is what it's like  being on the receiving end  of those sound effects  oh this is so much fun  my little finger's dancing  uh  Jesse in Cleveland  is imagining that she said  um  even Marcus wasn't that big  uh 
[01:08:00]  well that's a linger longer  from earlier  Ant so  I think that Anthony's getting  a little too possessive  to be honest with you  you think Jimmy  yeah  why did you say that  he was just overheard  like she was trying to leave  and he's like  I wish I knew how to quit you  you guys  are complete  assholes  this is fun  yeah  I like the buttons  I'm actually very happy for you  I think it's great  that you're still on your date  and you guys just  clicked better than anybody  thought you would  we were all hoping 
[01:08:30]  you'd come in  dejected and humiliated  of course but  yeah  the date is up to  the 16th hour  are we on the 16 hour date  yeah  give or take  uh  you know  an hour  but uh  yeah  well fucking Anthony  didn't play any games  no  no  show me how you suck  a guy's cock  the last time  I'm gonna ask you  nobody fucking  nobody tangled  with the comey  did uh  Jill talk to her father  because the father  was a bit concerned  this morning  yes  she talked to her father  and her brother 
[01:09:00]  oh my god  the brother got on our show  today and said something  about breaking your  what  what do you say  breaking your fingers  well did actually  she thought you were  very funny right  she loves your sense of humor  well yeah  she's very funny too  I gotta say  did you open with  the joke I told you  to open with  what joke is that  Jimmy  people can call me  anything they want  as long as they  don't call me  late for supper  is she holding you  hostage  you're losing your touch  why that was a good one 
[01:09:30]  that was good  that was a good joke  is she holding you  hostage  do you need help  is she being held hostage  no you  oh me  yeah  yes  yes  I'm a hostage  of love  oh  oh god  you better get your head  and your ass wired together  or I will  take a giant shit on you  now Anthony  um  Rush and Malloy  gave us some info today  yeah  they said there was a rumor 
[01:10:00]  and you might want to like  uh  ask her this  and see what kind of reaction  you get  that there was a rumor  that uh  something might have  went bad  with uh  an ex-boyfriend  and that she might have  crazy glued  his penis to his thigh  oh really  they said  they said this was a strong rumor  that we kind of talked about earlier  we're getting  we're getting a denial  here of that  okay  alright  I figured she would uh  you know  tell you the truth on that 
[01:10:30]  you know how the gossip  uh people could get  but  I think it's so cool  that you guys actually had  like one of these uh  fucking crazy  long dates  I mean you know  it would have been fun  to have you today  because just to hear about it  but  yeah  I think it's fucking pretty cool  where uh  where do we go from here  the fact that  you know  I wasn't in today  you know  kind of shows that  we're still on our date  dude  like you thought  like  the cat's balls cut off  dude  you really thought  we thought you were going to be in today  or  what's wrong with you 
[01:11:00]  when do you think we were born  I kind of knew  you know  you were the one that said  you know  when can we expect you to not be in  right  right  you uh  she's a very very attractive girl Anthony  well she certainly is  uh  Keith's uh  wife is going to be at your house  in five minutes  I'm just getting a little uh  little text message  to warn you of that  oh  shit  yeah  so uh  you know  you might want to put your clothes back on  I  my clothes are on  are you shitting 
[01:11:30]  are you in the bathroom shitting  no  no  I'm not  Anthony's shitting  Anthony's taking a Metamucil dump  I am not  I think Anthony's date was so crazy  that he's dehydrated  right now  well I'll give you that  a little dehydration going on  no  we're  we're just uh  we're hanging out  I actually have to uh  uh  hop in the shower  for a moment  and then  uh  we're going to get the cat's balls cut off  all right  just keep the 
[01:12:00]  the phone on the  uh  you know  open and uh  so we can listen in on your shower  I don't think so  pal  what  what happened  no  so we see our friend Anthony  tomorrow morning  absolutely  I will be in tomorrow morning  at 5 a.m.  hi this is Jill Michelini  and I'm the reason Anthony is phoning it in this morning  honey can you make me some breakfast in bed  it's Opie and Anthony's cringe moments  you'll laugh so hard you just might soil yourself 
[01:12:30]  it's Opie and Anthony's cringe moments  hey uh  it's uh  Jim Norton from the Opie and Anthony radio program  welcoming all the new subscribers  joining us after turning on their new XM and Sirius radios  hello  describe the show a bit  it's shitty  thanks for checking us out  this is the worst of Opie and Anthony 
[01:13:00]  and uh  we're back with the worst of Opie and Anthony's 2008 cringiest moments  we're in the middle of Anthelini  yeah uh  when we last left Anthelini  they had met  they'd gone on their first date  lasted 20 to 22 hours  they were in love  but E-Rock  all good things  I don't want to hear it  I don't want to hear it  it's true  I don't want to hear it  you know the way this thing ends  I'll take my head  put your headphones back on  all good things must come to an end 
[01:13:30]  as did Anthelini  now the Anthelini relationship  was one of the best things that happened to me in 2008  why is that?  because the Anthelini relationship is where primetime gossip first got started  that is right  I forgot  and I feel like that's where me and Derek shine as a team  Derek is kind of the silent partner in that  but he loves doing them so much  good job Derek  but this  Ant kind of stopped talking about Jill for a while  yeah  and so we all kind of knew the writing was on the wall  very cryptic  yeah  and then he started getting cryptic 
[01:14:00]  one day he just kind of cryptically said  well we're kind of not together  let's say so and so did so and so  without giving too much information  a matter of days passed  and Ant decided to get into detail  oh good  about what happened  this is the description of the hostage exchange that went down  after Anthelini burned to the ground figuratively speaking  is this foreshadowing again?  no  foreshadowing already happened  oh  but what this is  is the worst of Opie and Anthony  2008 cringiest moments  love is a bad 
[01:14:30]  it's Opie and Anthony's worst of 2008 cringe moments  yeah  I'll look back at some of the most uncomfortable  yet hilarious portions of the show  three  two  happy new year  happy new year  it's Opie and Anthony's worst of 2008 cringe moments  happy new year  we're back with more primetime gossip  just when you thought the Anthelini Express had come to a halt 
[01:15:00]  not so fast  we found out that the relationship became complicated recently  when Joe found a friend of Anthony's who was hanging out in his closet  but before the two could call it quits  Anthony has one more assignment that he needs to complete  what we learned was that  a couple things left Anthony's house  that shouldn't have left the house after the breakup  yeah  and for Anthony to get these items back  that he really wants back  I must exchange goods and services 
[01:15:30]  right  you have to pick up $500 worth of dry cleaning  something like that  worth of dry cleaning  and by a new camera  and a new digital camera  that's right  dry cleaning and electronics  I'm sure that's a piece of cake for such a fancy radio millionaire  and everyone's wondering how did it go Anthony  well  it went  very  smoothly  I had no problems  whatsoever  there wasn't any arguments  very good  because  I didn't go  looks like the trip was just too much for Mr. Anthony to make 
[01:16:00]  luckily  he was able to acquire the services of his manservant Keith  and after nearly a week  gave an update on the property exchange situation  is it over  did the hostage exchange take place  well  oh  Keith  yeah  I was over the house yesterday  supervising some construction  okay  and  he reminded me of the situation  I  got some cash 
[01:16:30]  and  apparently  Keith is gonna  take care of the exchange  gonna  that's right  the exchange still has not taken place  and why  is Anthony still hanging on to those shiny memories  of the days of Anthelini  or is he just lazy  we can't be sure  but in the meantime  Anthony is building a secret extension  onto his magical castle  for his mystery guest  building a hidden closet  a hatch  a secret  a false wall 
[01:17:00]  in the back of the closet  that can be opened up  with the press of a button  maybe he really is just lazy  but looking into the future  and  maybe don't give the next one  your house key and alarm codes  keep it locked  as PTG will be back  with all the latest breaking news  in and around  the Opie and Anthony universe  we have to clear the field  because  we would be doing a disservice  if we don't get into this hostage exchange thing  well of course  where we at today 
[01:17:30]  Boston missed a great show yesterday  yeah  you know  why couldn't they be preempting today's show  well  they had a preempt yesterday's show  what  there's the  what what what  there's the perp right there  he's now called a perp  I'm just calling her the perp  Anthony  could you give us  maybe a 30 second summary  that brings us to  to today  where do I have to start  well obviously  Anthony Lini broke up  that's spaghetti on the wall  Anthony Lini broke up  spaghetti on the wall  when I was a child  right that's  it all began with that  yes  um 
[01:18:00]  well  uh  yes  the uh  Jill Nicolini  Anthony Cumia relationship  uh  did break up  after three or four months  um  yeah  it was like a summer  you know  summer romance  yeah  yeah  uh  very volatile breakup  uh  it wasn't just a hey  you know  I don't think this is a working out thing  it was a  she walked in  um  I was uh  participating in some  extracurricular activity  with uh  some other um  a female  uh  who then went into the closet  to get dressed 
[01:18:30]  I got dressed  I then unlocked the bedroom door  Jill came in  uh  gave me a little  uh  third degree  um  opened the closet door  eventually  saw the girl  uh  took a pic  took a picture  yeah  it's from memories  I don't know why she would take the picture  but  that she did  uh  we had a  little heated discussion  she took off in my Escalade  even though her car was at your house  yes  um  I went to work the next day  in the SRX 
[01:19:00]  uh  she then returned  with the Escalade  and my keys that were on the Escalade keychain  and went into my house  and took some items  uh  which she kept  some other items  that belonged to the girl  um  that was in the closet  were uh  taken out back  to the fire pit  my nice new fire pit  and thrown in there  and burned  to a crisp  um  nothing left  and uh  uh 
[01:19:30]  I needed some  of the stuff back  that she took  that she took  it was um  uh  easy pass  laptop  or a few other things  but um  some odd  inconsequential  yeah  she brought some things back  she took her own clothes  from the house  uh  but kept a few things  which I thought was odd  and then she said  I'll return these things  if you pay for my dry cleaning  which is $500  worth of dry cleaning  and buy me a new camera 
[01:20:00]  that was lost  at the party  at my house  you don't know  I don't know  at some point  it ended up in the pool  oh  it got out of the pool  and as it was drying off  on a table somewhere  it disappeared  uh oh  um  so  in order to avoid  any uh  conflict  or perpetuation  of this  um  situation  I uh  decided  look  I'll give Keith  the cash  he could run it over there  pick up the stuff  because I really want  no more contact  because um 
[01:20:30]  there's a certain  instability  that goes along  with starting fires  uh  with other people's  possessions  I understand  the whole woman  scorned thing  believe me  I do understand  that there's probably  a uh  you know  a lot of emotions  going on there  but I've been  I've been through that  with uh  some pretty crazy chicks  in the past  and um  they never started  things on fire  uh  it never took  some of my stuff  and held it 
[01:21:00]  you know  for ransom  um  so  I didn't want  any contact  I want no  no problems  I don't want  any  any um  allegations  to pop up  that things  were happened  or done  it's just safer  for me  to not have  any contact  and I completely  agree with you  yeah  so I said  others thought  you should have  one more meeting  face to face  no  the breakup  was done  face to face  believe me  it was uh  you know  as as it happened  yeah  uh  but the exchange  of goods  I never want 
[01:21:30]  to be in the same  place  no  and and finally  uh  the hostage  exchange  happened last  night  finally happened  last night  a month after  the breakup  well over a month  a month later  right  a month later  uh  there had been  a couple of  texts  and uh  phone calls  exchanged  in the interim  one of which  was a question  to me  if that laptop  was mine  I answered  yes  because if I  answered no  the laptop 
[01:22:00]  would have  suffered the  same fate  that this girl's  other stuff  had suffered  perhaps being  burned  or just thrown  out a window  from uh  many feet up  um  so I said  it was my  computer  was it  no it was  not  it was the  computer  I would say  now  yes  I didn't want  to say that  earlier  because if  she found  out  you know  she would  have uh  destroyed it  or something  perhaps  I wasn't  sure of that  at the time  um  so  Keith 
[01:22:30]  goes over  there  uh  last night  and uh  well  Keith's on  the phone  perhaps he  can uh  give a little  more information  of this  he was  this is  first hand  he actually  went there  and I want  to know  what happened  Keith  good morning  hi Keith  what are you  sleepy  no he's been  through a war  yeah  I was making  sleep easy  aw  Keith has some  ridiculous hours  too  sorry  I understand  but uh  no all right 
[01:23:00]  you went over  to uh  Jill's apartment  correct  uh  first thing  Keith texts me  and I  I assume  the money  is quite enough  in exchange  for my stuff  but apparently  it wasn't  can I  can I say  something  yes  I have no  doubt in my  mind  that uh  you  the money  was more  than five  hundred dollars  oh it was  because you're  just such a  nice guy  no no  I'm not a  nice guy  I wanted  the stuff  back  and and  the camera  like  I didn't 
[01:23:30]  know what  that cost  or anything  so I  I was  I gave  like eight  hundred  and then it  was just  rounded off  like get  get rid of  a thousand  dollars  so it cost  me a thousand  dollars  just to get  some of your  stuff back  to get my own  stuff back  their house  yes  and by the  way the  number in  my head  was a  thousand  a thousand  dollars  I was gonna say  Anthony didn't  spend five hundred  he spent a thousand  on this  not only was it  a thousand dollars  but uh  at the last minute  she also demanded  what Keith  Ant's foot  I forget 
[01:24:00]  how about  the boot  oh the boot  yes  yes  but Ant  gave her that  already  eighty  oh  the giant  cement  boot  that has been  sitting on the  side of my  house  as a spider  home now  what's the  boot  it's a big  cement  planter  that is in  the shape  of a giant  cowboy boot  right  that I can only  assume my  neighbors were  horrified at  you bought that 
[01:24:30]  when you were  with her  I didn't buy  it  she did  nope  who did  I think her  mom came over  with it one  day  and it was  dropped off  and we kind of  made some funny  pictures  that Stump Brain  had of Keith  like sitting on  it like a  toilet  and stuff  a housewarming  gift  I don't know  what it was  it was a  housewarming  it was an  abomination  you didn't like  the boot  no  well if he  put it on the  side of his  house  I don't think  he liked it  Jimmy  I think at  one point  it was  suggested  oh yeah  you can put  it in  front  on the 
[01:25:00]  front  I went  new  new  it's going  on the  side of the  house where  no one  goes  so she needs  the boot  so she wanted  the boot  so Keith  had to come  all the way  to my house  first  wait he was  already at  her apartment  no no  but he was  I was on  the way  but I had  to stop  and pick  up the  boot  and the  thing weighs  like 85  pounds  it's 85  pounds  of cement  it's a  giant  big  cowboy  boot  so he  had to  pick up  the boot  then drive  back there  and now  when you  got there  why don't  you fill  us in  paint a  little picture  of what 
[01:25:30]  happened  alright  well she  comes downstairs  with  I guess  her new  boyfriend  or something  he's quite  strapping  is he strapping  of course he is  wow  that's nice  she probably hired a model  or something  wow  because it would get  back to air  like  just kind of going  with some of the  stuff Patrice was  saying  are you jealous  what  me and exes  are just like  I don't care  what they do 
[01:26:00]  go ahead  get a bowl  yeah  that's right  bowls are always  black but good  so she comes  down  obviously she  wanted to  have a male  presence  there  when you  were there  yes  she came  down with  the strapping  young man  yes  and then  I walked  in  and she  came down  with the  laptop  so you never  actually went up  into the apartment  no  no  oh see  and the laptop 
[01:26:30]  and the  easy pass  now  were there any  accessories  with the laptop  like the power  cord  no  no  anything  yeah of course  not  why would  there be  ya friggin  bitch  ugh  I'm disgusted  I pay a thousand  dollars for a laptop  and no power cord  or accessories  that were with it  in the bag  by the way  dummy  you kept the girl  here another  two months longer 
[01:27:00]  than she was supposed  to be  cause you burnt  her birth certificate  and she can't cross  the border without it  ya idiot  new info  ya dummy  new info  coming in  yeah  new info  burnt her birth  certificate  and  her grandfather's ashes  were in the bag too  that she was supposed  to sprinkle  along with her other  like  family members  and now it's sitting  in my fire pit  grandpa's in my fire pit  are you kidding me  she's a dummy  wait a minute  wait a minute 
[01:27:30]  oh this story just  dude  alright look  dude it's an endless  cavalcade of friggin  so a girl  this is a book  a girl came from  another country  to visit you  and brought her  grandfather's ashes  with her  Thailand  my grandfather  was 25  where were these ashes  where were these ashes  supposed to be  dumped  there was  you know  just a place  a special place  on Long Island 
[01:28:00]  that was  it was a place  that was special  like to  everybody that got  some of the ashes  okay  so I guess  the grandfather's wishes  was take some of my ashes  and put them somewhere  that's special  for you  you know  so wherever that would have been  I didn't ask  I'm not you know  that's kind of a personal thing  but they were in the duffel bag  that went into the fire  why didn't you check the pockets  of the damn thing  before your emotional  nut job that you are  throw it into the goddamn fire pit  holy Christ 
[01:28:30]  I know what this is about  you are so creeped out  that you got dead guy ashes  in your fire pit now  no crap  no you know  what this is all about  now I got my crap back  and I don't care  what I say  that's it  we've been waiting  for this  god damn  emotional  wreck  that one is  what a nut  taken by  not even looking  there were wires  and stuff  that go to the computer  well you know 
[01:29:00]  what they say  hell hath no fury  like a woman scorned  look  I've been with  women scorned  I've seen them before  this is beyond  a woman scorned  this is some type of  wacky  psycho crap  that only  like loony bitches  go through  you don't friggin  circle  uh charges  on my American Express bills  while I'm away at work  and say  was this a charge  when you were with  one of your whores 
[01:29:30]  I was just out  with Janice Rossi  more new info  new info  everybody  more new info  yeah  what about the plugs  did you  Keith did you ask  about the plugs  or have you called  to find out  maybe there's a  rational reason  no  no  she burnt them  I really didn't get into that  you know what  she burnt them  or threw them away  or whatever the hell  she did  a laptop  was just  a laptop  I paid a thousand dollars  in extortion money 
[01:30:00]  for a laptop  without any power cords  or anything  and an easy pass  which I  should have  just cancelled  and gotten a new one  but it was the principle  of the thing  that was bothering me  I actually wanted to see  if she had it  and I want to check  the bill also  to see if she's been using it  oh I'd probably do that  yeah  I'll believe me  I'll check  and see if that thing's  been used in the past month  to go through tolls  or whatever  what do you have to say  to the people  and it's coming in a few  not a lot  but a few are saying 
[01:30:30]  that this is one  big giant PR stunt  you are  you know something  come here  and I'll choke you  you could join  everything in the fire pit  I'll burn you  you dummies  no it's not a big  PR stunt  the girl lost  her friggin mind  and burnt  another girl's stuff  and burnt the guy  that was already burnt  burnt the burnt guy  burnt the burnt guy  his grandfather's ashes  were in the bag  and now it's in my  fire pit  is it still in an urn 
[01:31:00]  though  it's not burnable  no it was in a little  like that's just it  if it was in a little urn  or something  maybe it would have been  seen  it was in like  a little pouch  like a little  type of drawstring  kind of pouch thing  and it's like  you know  if this psycho  would have looked  through the bag  and perhaps thought  you know  this seems like  an important thing  I realize I'm a woman  scorned  but I can keep  my rationality  in my head  for a few minutes  and go through this 
[01:31:30]  and see if there's  anything of grave  importance  in this bag  before I  burn it like a nut  and then  I find out  well can we ask  Keith how the rest  of this went down  or you want to  go ahead  yeah  or you want to  jump in  no I just kind of  want to jump in  with the laptop  Keith conveyed it  to me  but I just got  like some  editorializing to do  that's like  over a year psycho  not three months psycho  you're very right  that's yeah 
[01:32:00]  that's over a year psycho  not three months psycho  Danny yes  like it is kind of  crazy behavior  but I could almost  understand it  if you had like  a real deep  and lengthy relationship  dude 20 years married  and people get their  clothes thrown out  the window  exactly  and the guy's like  well I guess  I gotta go get  an apartment  you guys dated  for the summer  yeah  like that was  kind of  it was the romance  from Greece  Jesus  and then  and she's burning 
[01:32:30]  things  and taking things  so then  I find this out  last night  this is another  capper  she asked Keith  so  is this Anthony's  laptop  oh yeah  so let me  okay go ahead Keith  so I get there  and now  we're in the lobby  so I have the money  is strapping guy  trying to like  look like tough guy  to you  no he was  he was nice  very nice  oh okay  I thought if he was  going to try to look  tough guy  I'd have laughed 
[01:33:00]  because you know  Keith's kind of a  badass  he's unassuming Keith  at times but  you don't want to  F with Keith  is Keith  is Keith one of those  guys that you  would probably  be underestimated  at times  absolutely  Keith could be  a problem  yeah  you look like  because you are  a barrel chested  boob of a man  who likes to be nude  boob of a man  he's got cop anger  and retard strength  okay so 
[01:33:30]  so  you know  she goes  okay  how do you  you know  how do you want  to do this  it's okay  well I will give you  500 for the  laptop  and then I'll give  you 500  for the easy pass  holy jesus  so  we make the  exchange  and I think  pictures got  taken of the  you know  the cash  pictures  what's with the  pictures  everything's a  god damn  photo op  with this broad  give me a break 
[01:34:00]  wait  I missed something  what  they exchanged  the money for  merchandise  pictures were  being taken  why  why  why  you know  maybe  evidence  that we  made the  exchange  evidence  evidence  that you're  paying for  stolen goods  you're  you're  buying back  stolen  property  yeah  holy  Toledo  so  after  my language  we're standing  there and  you know  we're making  our small  talk after  she says  so this is 
[01:34:30]  an anthony's  laptop  and I said  I said  oh yeah  yeah  that's  you know  that's his  and she goes  no it's not  and I go  and I'm  and I bet  you were wondering  at the time  Keith  now how  could she  know  because by  the way  no power  cords  again  because she  somehow  I don't know  what she did  with them  and the  laptop  was broken  it couldn't  be started  the laptop  so how  how could  she find  out  Keith  uh  seems she 
[01:35:00]  knows  somebody  who knows  computers  computer  forensics  correct  she had  the hard  drive  dissected  to get  the information  off of it  correct  how crazy  is that  that's some  CSI stuff  why  what purpose  would there  be  to take  a computer  hard drive  from a broken  computer  and  uh  take it to 
[01:35:30]  a computer  hard drive  forensics  expert  to then  get the  information  off of it  by the way  the hard drive  had been put  in that computer  two days  prior  so there was  really nothing  much on it  um  none of my  information  whatsoever  and  nothing  on there  that uh  uh  the girl  mystery girl  in the closet  uh  cared about  let me ask  one question  was  did you ever  take  photographs  when you  and her  were together  that might 
[01:36:00]  no  there was  not  one  compromising  photo  ever taken  any picture  that was  taken  was done  with her  photographers  or her  taking them  there was  no incriminating  photos  whatsoever  that were  taken  so  if she  was  looking  for that  like  even  that  I  would  say  okay  well  maybe  she  wanted  to  make  sure  you know  get  those  up  but  no  no  unbelievable  dissected  the computer  and found  out it  wasn't my  computer  oh 
[01:36:30]  no wires  no power  supply  I'm more  creeped out  about dead  guy in the  fire pit  yeah  you know  and I  know  this person  was special  to somebody  but to me  because I  don't know  anybody  in this  situation  it's  dead guy  in the  fire pit  that's  creeping me  out  exactly  scoop a little  out  I think  it's  you know  maybe  maybe you  smoke it  a little  there's good  times happen  in that  backyard  you know  good times  technically  this  even though 
[01:37:00]  there's ashes  of a person  whenever you  have someone  cremated  there's ashes  with the  coffin  it's not  just the  body  there's always  a little  something else  mixed in  there  but it  wasn't  all of  that  it was  they each  got like a  small little  sample  so you're not  going to take  you know  the big stuff  and anything  like that  you're just  going to take  you know  obviously you  would have seen  something in the pit  but no  it was just a  little sampling  that each one  would have  you know  if dummy  would have 
[01:37:30]  looked in  there  though  and maybe  given a  little  and I don't  want to use  the word  consideration  because obviously  I wasn't  doing any  consideration  here  you know  I'm looking  at it  from the  outside  and obviously  I was  the  you know  the heel  the douche  in the  relationship  by ending  it that way  you know  I'm not  going to sit  here and try  to talk  myself up  as the  good guy  in this  but  that's  just  psycho  crap  that is  psycho  you know 
[01:38:00]  if you're  going to  burn a  bag full  of someone's  clothing  maybe you  should look  in some  of the  pockets  of the  bag  first  and make  sure  there's  nothing  of grave  importance  in there  literally  grave  importance  I mean  you know  documents  things like  that  just  important  stuff  that was  in there  other stuff  it's just  that is  a really 
[01:38:30]  crazy  way  immature  way  of dealing  with  a  situation  you know  anything  else  Keith  I want  to talk  to some  hockey  players  and see  if they  had to  pay  hundreds  of dollars  for their  sticks  and gloves  I got a  game tonight  could you  please  just  give me  my  gloves  back  go  Islanders  Keith  was it  was the  small talk  awkward  you know  I tried  to be  as cordial 
[01:39:00]  as possible  and it  was  it was  nice  I handed  over the  cement  boot  to the  strapping  man  who  then  carried  the  boot  away  put it  on  and wore it  away  that's good  were you getting  the scary  smile  no no no  it was  was it  cordial  it was very  pleasant  yeah  and uh  you know  she just  said  you know  why  couldn't  you do  this  himself  and I  said  why  couldn't  I do  it  because  you're  crazy  look at  you  you  you  burned  my  stuff  you 
[01:39:30]  nut  oh  and uh  I'm  looking  you know  I said  this  is my  job  this  is  what  I  do  that's  right  Keith  is my  personal  liaison  and  Anthony  is  convinced  today  that  Jill  is  giving  secret  messages  I  think  she  was  giving  me  jabs  on  the  traffic  reports  hey  it's  quite  a  hard  drive  if  you're  on  the  expressway  today  oh  I  get  it  hard  drive  they're  cleaning  up  remains 
[01:40:00]  oh  yeah  they're  cleaning  up  the  remains  of  an  accident  oh  I  get  it  I  get  it  oh  wow  oh  Jim  McSweeney  from Jersey  writes  you should  play  Opie's  prediction  that  quote  this is  either  the best  thing  that will  happen  to  Anthony  or  it  will  end  up  as  fantastic  radio  I  said  that  day  one  day  effing  one  well  you know  something  that  that is  some 
[01:40:30]  real  crazy  bitch  stuff  that's  psycho  bitch  stuff  like  I've  been  I  I  I've  seen  it  I've  seen  it  with  other  relationships  like  some  psycho  bitch  stuff  but  wow  you gotta  have  your  Escalade  checked  out  I'm  thinking  what  do  you  think  bugs  I  don't  know  bugs  yeah  I  don't  know  GPS  devices  I  don't  know  wasn't  it only  a few 
[01:41:00]  days  later  that you  were  experiencing  problems  with your  transmission  that you  had to  bring it  in  oh  she  was  probably  just  yeah  it  is  true  it  was  literally  a couple  of days  after that  my  truck  wouldn't  move  I  hit  the  gas  and  my  transmission  was  something  was  wrong  with a  valve  on the  tranny  it  was  like  I'm  sure  she  was  just  like  that's  how she  drove  everywhere  if she  knows  a  computer  guy  maybe  she  knows  a  mechanic 
[01:41:30]  too  yeah  no  she  knows  a  lot  of  people  that  could  do  a  lot  of  things  of  course  I  don't  know  I  don't  know  what  am I  supposed  to  think  though  when  she's  cracking  hard  drives  open  to see  what  the hell's  on  computers  that are  broken  looking  through my  Amex bills  for which  whores I  took where  she was  really circling  stuff  and you  went to  dinner  the day  before you  took me  to the  same  restaurant 
[01:42:00]  circle  whoosh  big  whoosh  whoosh  it's me  and Keith  were  there  some  of  the  circles  where  it says  did  you  take  one  of  your  whores  here  what  was  the  accurate  answer  yes  of  course  I  took  one  of  my  whores  there  oh  god  I  just  gotta  give  a  message  to  David  Hinckley  I'm  sorry 
[01:42:30]  you're  gonna  have  to  scrap  your  FUV  article  for  tomorrow  perhaps  and talk  about  all the  stuff  that was  going on  how I  had to  pay  a thousand  dollars  to get  a broken  violated  laptop  back  and an  easy  pass  how much  does an  easy  pass  cost  to  replace  yeah  why  do  you  need  that  nothing  that  I  don't  get  couldn't  you  just  cancel  that  principle  I'm  a very  principle  oriented  guy  I will 
[01:43:00]  cut  off my  nose  to spite  my  face  constantly  constantly  I  I'm  doing  it  in  a  court  case  right  now  I  can't  get  into  details  but  believe  me  in  order  to  save  forty five  hundred  dollars  I  told my  lawyer  I don't  care if  it  cost  me  a hundred  thousand  just  do  it  I'm  I'm  really  an  idiot  but  you  should  have  given  a  lower  number  to  the  lawyer  because  that's  what  he's  looking  at  he's  like  okay  I  don't  care  if 
[01:43:30]  cost  five  thousand  yes  maybe  I  should  have  started  low  you  did  make  the  lawyer  very  excited  someone  is  saying  you  must  have  a  magical  penis  because  this  is  just  unbelievable  that  somebody  would  go  to  this  extent  after  a  breakup  Anthony  I  am  such  a  good  fuck  whoa  I  hit  the  dump  button  on  myself  on  that  one  Anthony  basically  implied 
[01:44:00]  basically  Anthony's  advertising  in a  said  situation  he  would  be  the  bull  he  would  be  the  one  brought  in  teasing  of  course  I'm  modest  there's  no way  we have  time for  phone  calls  unfortunately  but let  me run  them  down  Greg  Jersey  and is  lucky  he didn't  get  dead  rabbits  and  butcher  knives  and in  Massachusetts  and has  to bring  up  bring her  up  on  charges  that's  what I  want  more  interaction  maybe  she  took  the  birth  certificate  and  didn't  burn  it  no  there  was  questions  asked  about  other  things 
[01:44:30]  and  she  apparently  said  that  anything  else  that's  missing  that  wasn't  burned  was thrown  away  in my  garbage  at  house  which  I  see  as  bull  crap  because  my  pistol  permit  was  missing  and  I  thought  perhaps  she  had  thrown  it  away  so  I  went  through  every  garbage  pail  in my  house  looking  for it  and  found  none  of  this  missing  stuff  you know  like  a curling  iron  and  computer  wires  things like  that  that couldn't  be  burned  because 
[01:45:00]  you know  she's  like  you know  she  burned  everything  but if  she burned  a curling  iron  you'd  see the  iron  part  of it  it  is  going  to  melt  in  the  fire  pit  but  that  wasn't  in  there  so  apparently  she said  she threw  them  away  but I  checked  all the  garbages  so that's  crap  did you  change the  locks  you said  you did  people are  asking that  yeah  yeah  Jennifer  Jersey  supporting  it  she  writes  I  know  you hate  the name  but she  is  supporting  you  she  writes  I  walked  in  on  boyfriend  of  10  years  didn't  even  go  this 
[01:45:30]  Nate  in  Brooklyn  this  is  just  like  Ant's  ex-wife  stories  all you  bitches  are  nuts  out  there  god damn  all you  bitches  are  crazy  just on  different  levels  I  think  some  of  them  are  tolerable  nuts  others  intolerable  nuts  all right  Keith  wow  I don't  know  what  does  that  anything  else  to add  Keith  no  just  that  I  do  have  to  get  going  because  I 
[01:46:00]  am  meeting  the  security  camera  guy  at  Anthony's  house  at  930  he's  going  to  be  put  around  the  house  I  want  a  scuff  face  I  want  scanners  he  said  he  couldn't  make  it  until  next  week  but  I  had  to  move  it  up  with  some  of  the  nice  flat  screen  plasma  in  your  bedroom  at  my  house  I  love  it  thanks  I'm  glad  you  like  it  well  that  was  pretty  much  just  for  the  guests  Anthony  may  have  of course  not  your  own  use

[01:47:00]  from  afar  she's  smiling  for  the  first  time  in  many  weeks  she's  looking  happy  happy  happy  she is  looking  look at  that  smile  oh  boy  did  I  get  him  oh  did  I  nail  him  for  a  grand  for  a  broken  computer  that  I  know  it's  on  it  what's  up  with  the  puffy  eyes  though  huh  I  don't  know  she  was  out  a  week  I  think  she  might  have  some  stuff  done  all  right  we  gotta  take a  break  Keith  it's  gonna be  quite the  chapter  a lot 
[01:47:30]  of things  I found  out today  that I  didn't even  know about  oh  really  today  like what  I didn't  know  the stuff  I was  screaming  did you  notice any  puffiness  when you  saw her  up close  no  no  no  no  no  scarring  or  no  anything  like that  I  just might  write the  book  bigger  I  think  they  look  smaller  stunt  brain  no  I  think  they  look  smaller  I  wonder  if  she  had  something  done  there  really  look at  her  smiling  don't  smile

[01:48:30]  worst of  opian  anthony  2008's  cringiest  moments  i'm primetime  sam roberts  from the  opian anthony  show  i'm  erock  well you  didn't let  me give  you a  proper  introduction  you're  primetime  sam  roberts  no i  know  who i  am  but we're  going through  the cringiest  moments that  happened in  2008 and  more specifically  we're getting to  the end of the  anthony saga  you're still on  this  well it was a  lot that 
[01:49:00]  happened in  2008 and we  cut a lot of  stuff  how long was  anthony  it wasn't long  but it was  good  basically we're  to the point  where ant  went on air  and talked  about the  breakup  he talked  about everything  but jill  i guess he  thinks that  she lied  about things  because a  column popped  up in the  gossip columns  yes  and one of  the informants  they used  was jill's  friend who  was anonymous  then all of a  sudden jill  starts emailing 
[01:49:30]  anthony's  friends and  co-workers  about what  quote unquote  really happened  yes  once this  happened it  got ant  so upset  that not only  did he have  to go on  the air and  clear his  name and  say exactly  what the  truthful nature  of what  happened was  but he  decided to  drop the  a-bomb  on anthelini  completely  obliterating it  no one saw  this coming  but it was  perhaps the  most hilarious  moment of  2008  do you know  how anthony  found out about  the co-worker  emails do you  know who  sent it to  him i have  no idea it 
[01:50:00]  had to be  somebody good  and handsome  it was the  great ron  bennington  oh i thought  it was erock  no it was  not me  well ron  bennington's  also handsome  i'm neither  great nor  handsome  that's true  but uh you  can hear the  description of  the email  yourself and  get ready strap  in because the  a-bomb is  coming it's  the worst of  opie and anthony  2008's cringiest  moments  it's opie and  anthony's worst  of 2008 cringe  moments  yeah  a look back at  some of the most  uncomfortable yet  hilarious portions  of the show  three two  happy new year

[01:51:30]  80s new wave  friday on the  opie and anthony  year  yeah we're back  with the opie and  anthony show  now uh where are  we at  lies  lots of lies  huh  we had just uh  gone through the  russian malloy  thing cleared up a  few little issues  there but for the  most part this had  uh a little  transcribing of our  radio show and  what i said on that  and then some  source  some source  a friend of 
[01:52:00]  uh jill's kind of  added in what she  uh felt second hand  was her side of  things leaving out  uh some details  but now comes the  email  uh i got this last  night  um apparently  it's being sent  out to people  that um  uh somebody said  if you support  her side of  this  like she must  have gotten  some emails  and it's like  oh you know  he's such a 
[01:52:30]  douche and  what  guy  i think i  bought that  i really think  i bought that  one  i remember being  dragged to go  shopping  i think i bought  that  oh  give me it  back  so this is  the email  that is  now going  around  and it's  supposedly  her side  of the  conversation  of the  situation  thank you  so much  for your  support  but i must 
[01:53:00]  admit i  really did  fall in  love with  him  and  was  devastated  when i  caught him  cheating  it was  bad  let's  see  it  happened  the  night  of  our  luau  so  that  was  august  16th  and for  two weeks  i cried  and was  devastated  but now  almost six  weeks later  i am so  much better  and have  moved on  completely  not really  if you're  writing emails  yeah  moved on  completely 
[01:53:30]  until yesterday  you hadn't  moved on  completely  you still  had my  crap  and was  holding it  until i  gave you  a thousand  dollars  keep that  in mind  uh  still in  disbelief that  he's bragging  about how  cool it  was to  have this  20 year  old in  his bedroom  while i  left  only to  come back  i mean i  was practically  living there  yeah  that was  partly the  problem  i was  falling right  back into 
[01:54:00]  it  but it  taught me  a lesson  and i sure  know i  deserve so  much better  and karma  will come  around  please don't  believe all  the things he  says on the  air  like this  morning  i was so  disgusted  yes keith  came over  to give me  one dollar  but for  what  for the  four hundred  and twenty  nine  dollar  camera that  he was  replacing  that got  stolen from  his house 
[01:54:30]  and six  hundred dollars  worth of dry  cleaning from  this place in  new york city  which he made  me bring my  clothes to  three months  ago  all right  here's here's  the first  blatant lie  i don't know  crap about dry  cleaning  i i what do i  know about dry  cleaning and i'm  gonna sit there  and go hey  you take your  clothes here  you take it to 
[01:55:00]  this dry  cleaner  why because it  costs six  hundred dollars  why did she  has her stuff  dry cleaned  like every day  there's dry  cleaning crap  going in and  out of her  apartment  everything is  wrapped in that  dry cleaner's  plastic stuff  clothes  everything  she knows a  lot about dry  cleaning and  she knew this  place and she  dropped it off  there and for 
[01:55:30]  some reason they  they charge six  hundred bucks and  then she assumed  it was my  responsibility to  pay it  which to me was  complete blackmail  to get my stuff  back of which  was not even my  laptop and an  easy pass i could  have canceled the  easy pass and got a  new one but it  was the principle of  the thing she owed  me my laptop my uh  easy pass and she  uh held it for  one thousand dollars 
[01:56:00]  i don't know what  this says is keith came  over to give me one  dollar maybe it's a  typo yeah maybe  typo one k maybe  maybe it was one k  well that sounds  normal then but for  what for the camera and  the dragon that comes  out to a thousand  dollars right or  thousand twenty nine  bucks right but i  mean the twenty nine  is inconsequential so  it seems funny for her  to say one dollar and  if it was a typo you  know it comes out to  the same the right  amount possibly just a  rebuttal for you 
[01:56:30]  saying it was a  thousand dollar black  mail probably saying  yeah it was a  thousand dollars but  for what well this is  what it was for right  oh okay well you know  why did i pay for her  dry cleaning why did i  pay for the camera she  lost the goddamn thing  yeah it was my house  at my party but you  know she lost the  camera but i said you  know something i'm just  gonna pay for it and end  this whole thing so keith 
[01:57:00]  goes to go over and give  her the thousand dollars  for my stuff and she  she texts keith or calls  him or whatever and says  she also wants the big  ceramic boot the giant  ceramic cowboy boot out by  my side door take it  good don't let it kick  you in the ass on the  way out  it's just uh oh so it  has nothing to do with  me trying to get money  from him 
[01:57:30]  there was a thousand  dollars you try to get  from me why am i paying  for your goddamn dry  cleaning and the camera  you lost  yeah i'm not agreeing to  that you could even  rationalize the camera in  some wacky way she  lost it at my house  all right i maybe i'll  take responsibility for  it is my house it was  our camera it  disappeared i could even  pay for that with with  some reservations but  the dry cleaning what the  hell am i paying for 
[01:58:00]  your clothes for so some  some uh uh uh hedge fund  guy can take them off  now those are my buttons  he's unbuttoning i paid  for him  we like to think that  keith actually came over  with one dollar  yeah i you know it  didn't slip it didn't  just slip through my mind  more than a few times  that keith went over  there gave her a buck and  pocketed nine hundred  ninety nine dollars  exactly what he did and  then pulled out his  police badges and then 
[01:58:30]  said give it to me or  i'll arrest you right  that has keith written  all over it so maybe  maybe this isn't a  typo yeah dude she's  crazy i gave her a  thousand bucks a thousand  bucks keith is living  large today maybe the  hedge fund guy bought  lehman brother stock  with it now it's worth a  dollar yeah boo boo all  right keith did just buy  a boat too yeah son of a  bitch that's my money  here's a new thousand  dollar hat it's made out  of platinum he bought a  platinum hat dope 
[01:59:00]  yeah so uh yeah she  wasn't trying to get  money from me right  uh it's just what he  was supposed to do until  i caught him cheating  no it's what you told me  to do after i was caught  cheating remember there  wasn't any i wasn't gonna  pick up your goddamn dry  cleaning what do i look  three shades oh that's what  my mom used to say i won't  say it though 
[01:59:30]  i'm your house boy  picking up your uh your  dry cleaning get it  yourself keith writes  listening to this and  watching uh the cw 11 is  like wizard of oz and  dark side of the moon  yeah when you put it on  yeah exactly great line  uh i'm not into his money  and never have been trust  me trust you how about  besides the thousand  dollars uh she does say i'm 
[02:00:00]  not in his money i never  asked for anything or  received anything but well  love haha so i thought  dinners and he did take me  clothes shopping two times  those two times i took you  clothes shopping one of which  i believe was in nashville  tennessee uh which i i paid for  first class tickets to get there  so the shopping spree kind of it  kind of chalked up to a lot of  money uh and and the clothes were 
[02:00:30]  very expensive and um and i bought  them for the love of god i bought  two hundred and eighty dollar flip  flops two hundred what two  hundred and eighty dollar flip  flops it was more than the room in  the hotel we were in what yeah  exactly what about two hundred and  eighty dollar flip flops what about 
[02:01:00]  the blinds yeah i'm getting to that  okay so she owns you know she owns a  condo in nashville you know  entrepreneurs buying some real  estate smart thing to do and i paid  for the blinds in this place that  she's renting out that was four g's  right there over four thousand  dollars for blinds why would you buy  blinds because it seemed like the  nice right thing to do four g's for 
[02:01:30]  four g's for blinds jesus yeah you  could cure the blind for that well the  blinds work the blinds work by the  way because she had no idea what was  going on so yes they were coming up  her eyes pretty good blinds they want  a hatch rim right yeah so it was uh  yeah if if i actually went through my  amex bills like she did and circled you  know everything where she thought i was  uh with a whore with one of my whores 
[02:02:00]  uh maybe she would have seen some of  these bills that uh i spent on her no  money stop it shop the clothes shopping  two times i had to buy her it had to be  i'm just taking a ballpark guess here  uh anywhere between five and eight  thousand dollars worth of clothes so that  you know we're talking tens of thousands  of dollars here  this it's and i never brought it up i 
[02:02:30]  never would have brought it up if if this  email didn't come around steven s from  uh bayshore writes 280 flip-flops yep  are those her breasts without the  implants  not flip-flops in that fashion  continue oh and for the burning of the  clothes now she's implicating keith in 
[02:03:00]  this my my my uh personal assistant this  guy is as loyal as the day is long that's  what i'll say keith keith has never been  anything but a very loyal friend personal  assistant uh he takes care of a lot of  my business as far as uh construction  around the house things like that him  and his wife and are great i consider  them uh very very close friends before 
[02:03:30]  uh any business is even involved he is  very trustworthy uh and she implies here  as for the burning of the clothes keith was  there and thought it was brilliant lol now i  can't see her toting a bag that at this  point uh keith doesn't even know what's in  it watching her throw it in my fire pit  and lighting it on fire and chuckling along 
[02:04:00]  with jill as uh uh this girl's clothes and  other possessions are burning in the fire pit  somehow i don't see keith um there watching and  saying oh that's brilliant so you know that's just another lie  just stop already i'm sure we'll hear from keith on that one  and if you were there keith you're completely fired and out of my life  teasing i know keith wasn't there he's too busy shopping with the 999 
[02:04:30]  yeah getting that platinum hat i only did this because when i came to the house  the day after the party i wanted to clean out my stuff my cats and all that i had to  get in my car and well i found all of her clothes in his closet  first of all none of your crap was in my closet so why were you going in there in the first place 
[02:05:00]  none of my crap was in my in your none of your crap was in my closet  it was all in my gun closet it moved in turned a manly closet into a fruit emporium  all those goddamn dresses and shoes my manly gun closet so she says uh yeah she came over  to clear out her stuff she was a 20 year old fan who was friends with danny  why i never danny it's news to me yeah exactly 
[02:05:30]  she has a story uh all wrong yes skanky as hell with pink hairs a spider tattoos a face piercing  but whoever upgrades when they cheat lol me  little little pissed she's got 10 years on you a little pissed  hmm a little pissed the skin's a little more supple hmm a little angry yeah it's got to sting a little 
[02:06:00]  bit doesn't it hmm doesn't have to go and uh maybe get those uh injections to cover up a few lines on  the face oh boy huh huh is that maybe uh a little more aggravating than just uh walking 
[02:06:30]  in uh on the closet and seeing that hmm  i don't see any dots on her ass where the lipo rod went in  i don't see any dots on her thighs or sides or belly where where a lipo rod went in  and perhaps you should have left a little more in your ass oh personal opinion shut up  okay  i'm gonna sit over here  what's the matter i'm really uncomfortable good 
[02:07:00]  well i'm not gonna sit here while some  bitch is lying lying on these emails that she's sending out to people  it's crap  make me look like a an ass  i i i i i did uh one thing that i confess was uh you know not the right thing to do 
[02:07:30]  i'll even be honest as far as that's concerned because that's what i do  i'm honest with this crap  it was cheating it was a bad thing to do the right thing would have been when i  saw that maybe i was feeling like i was uh uncomfortable in in the relationship it was  getting a little too deep in uh i had just gotten out of a relationship perhaps i should have  been honest forthright gone up to you and discussed this  but i i went about it completely wrong like a douchey guy uh but that i don't think justifies 
[02:08:00]  the kookiness in which you handled this situation  not mature for a girl of 35  okay that was a lie she's 30 all right  so where were we uh she went to clean out of stuff oh yeah found uh skanky girl's clothes  uh anyway he admitted uh he admitted he was keeping her stuff there and the night i wasn't 
[02:08:30]  over she was for those three weeks yep when i caught her in the closet she admitted that it  wasn't the first time they had had sex it was ongoing for three weeks prior i had some intuitive  feelings something wasn't right and i confronted him he blamed it on the fact that he was stressed 
[02:09:00]  and taking xanax because of his contract negotiations his contract negotiations  which by the way the only true thing in this email  all right i'll give her that i did say that hey leave me alone i'm sleepy  um and well i continue to believe him and then she throws this in and this really is just an  insult and btw by the way there were no ashes of this girl's grandfather in her bags i went through 
[02:09:30]  it all please your grandfather lived in canada for god's sake that's just part of his bit part of his  bit this effing bitch is denying the fact fact that this girl's grandfather's ashes were there  all the kids i guess were given a certain amount of these ashes it was in a little pouch it wasn't 
[02:10:00]  in some kind of urn or anything in that bag and dummy decides she's not going to go through the  pockets to see if there's important documentation which there was birth certificates you know important  stuff what uh i got you a beer what no i can't drink no not at this hour oh yes you can no it doesn't  go well with my xanax um yeah 
[02:10:30]  so she's saying that there were no ashes there absolutely were ashes that uh this girl's supposed  to you know take somewhere that i guess meant something and uh disperse them now they're in my  fire pit because dummy didn't go through the friggin uh uh pockets or did and and uh was being uh 
[02:11:00]  vindictive and threw them in in the fire pit and burned them anyway girl scorn girl plus fire  equals you know you're talking some left eye crap here left eye did that burnt the guy's house down  there were ashes in there there were of her grandfather you burnt them you put them in in  uh the fire pit and took away her opportunity to uh you know have that moment where she gets to  disperse the ashes of a loved one uh because you're a a jealous uh dummy 
[02:11:30]  oh jesus christ oh yeah i'll get to that  no ashes and what does that have to do with anything where he's from so what if you're from  somewhere you're not allowed to friggin have your ashes sprinkled in another country  that's the lamest excuse i ever heard and the laptop ended up with no wires no attachment no 
[02:12:00]  nothing because again she decided you know not to check not to pull things out of bags not to  you know maybe if you went through the pockets you'd have seen a birth certificate and not burned that  knowing that people need these things especially when they're trying to travel uh between two countries  good job dummy you just made it so she had to stay here longer so i could have sex with her more  jackass she'd have been gone 
[02:12:30]  oh  anyways on to the future and over with the past  i really appreciate the email have a great day jill so these are the uh emails she's sending out  um i just couple of couple of words for um hedge fund manager joseph  diva jillio oh boy i just got a couple of words for him 
[02:13:00]  couple of things jim and i gonna get some coffee  couple of things i'd like to um  why you guys why is your hand uh i think you're finally paying me back for all the times i made you  uncomfortable over the years go ahead and the floor is yours and by the way yeah she should have known  before the party that things were a little amiss when she found another girl's bra in my bathroom  you know that's kind of a what'd she think or say what's this bra doing in the bathroom 
[02:13:30]  and what'd you say i told her whose it was and that uh you know she was staying there and keeping  some stuff here which she was i didn't tell her the part about you know  all the sex stuff did you say that were you were you actually open like yeah she's staying at the  house yeah yeah i don't know if i can i ask a question i'm scared though feel free um  um i'll i'll talk vaguely and then you say uh uh virus show uh and maybe hold on 
[02:14:00]  hmm let me think virus show good good let me see this uh oh right right yeah yeah yeah yeah  we gave her uh we gave her a ride home the girl that keith jill and and yeah and the girl and the  girl uh from the pnc show we're all in your escalate after the virus show uh-huh and jill had no clue 
[02:14:30]  that that was the girl you were actually possibly with at this point i don't know uh yeah yeah she had  no clue you know ronnie said it yesterday when i did the crossover with him on the on the corner yes  that anthony's uh living guns and roses guns and roses he sums it up with that he goes anthony's  living guns and roses ronnie's a genius so how do you pull that one off after the virus show 
[02:15:00]  you got your quote girlfriend and the girl you're banging in the same car and and jill has no uh no  clue at that point i uh always always um uh show my ex-girlfriend uh my uh you know either new  girlfriend or who i'm having sex with or a very close friend sure uh you know i'll always give him  a little show yeah of who that is yeah oh so you had something uh oh hedge fund yes the hedge fund uh 
[02:15:30]  manager uh joseph d virgilio um oh boy well where do i start  first i hope uh  get one of those um get one of those uh things that go under your sheets  uh to cover up your mattress what do you mean like well you know if you ever have a a a child and 
[02:16:00]  and they go from the crib to the bed you might want to put something under there um you know  protect the mattress from any staining she takes these goddamn pills that keep the fat from digesting  like you know because she doesn't want to gain weight  so there's like these pills that keep fat from from digesting so it goes right through you it's not 
[02:16:30]  absorbed in your body it goes right through you so if she eats a lot of stuff with a lot of fat in it  she takes a lot more more of these of these uh you know fat go through your pills and then she goes to bed  and a certain part of her her her body uh will leak 
[02:17:00]  because that fat that isn't absorbed in the body has to come out somewhere and it comes out the normal  place but it is like i guess i guess that isn't a water real good water tight seal  so i woke up one morning and i swear it looked like someone overturned a pizza on my sheets  it was nothing but this yellowish grease a grease stain all over my sheets 
[02:17:30]  grease stain  came out of there and and and soaked into my bed sheets and it did it looked like you ever you  ever take a napkin and blot the grease from pizza dude it was exactly like that only spread out the size 
[02:18:00]  of it was probably about two feet wide yeah yeah and about two feet long like a roundish thing of two  feet diameter all all over her side of the bed on the sheets and this happens more than once believe me  so a dude um you know you might want you might want to get some uh cheap sheets what's the product  called ally or something like that is it ally yeah and there's a warning that says on the warning on 
[02:18:30]  the package that says bring extra clothes to work yeah it's that new uh drug they approved over the  counter the zenical the over-the-counter version and right there on the package you can buy it in all  the drug stores yeah it does work but it does warn you when you start using it you have to bring  extra clothes extra clothes because you'll leak into your clothes yeah uh yeah so that was wow all over  my sheets i woke up and i was like whoa whoa and believe me that took one activity that i really like 
[02:19:00]  doing right out of the picture making clan hoods  all right i guess that's all right oh they're calling her jill nicolicki  oh boy there it is oh there it is on palto jim's head is now in the crook of his arm he's leaned over  the back of the back of his chair he can't even look at what's going on jill nicolicki 
[02:19:30]  man feels a maybe that's why the dry cleaning was five hundred dollars  ah  and the reason you're spilling this today is because she spilled it on my mattress there you go  i uh no it's uh it's just it's it's i don't like being uh presented as 
[02:20:00]  as a liar i i'm being completely honest here on this program that's what i do i was honest in  saying that i was a you know a douche for doing what i did it was douchey to be in a relationship and  and and mislead somebody like that i understand that completely but the reaction uh wow kind of crazy

[02:41:00]  at the end she finally said my boyfriend is anthony from the opian anthony show and maybe that's what  stopped you that's why i was asking he knew right away he kept he was persistent on it and uh he kept  and it was uh it it was harassment on his part to where her boss had to come over to her and ask her  what what happened like uh uh people were saying that that gene was harassing you and stuff and um  yeah and then he comes in here and and fucking looking me right in the eyes and playing me like 
[02:41:30]  that well maybe i'll just fuck your girlfriend like and i laughed because it's like oh i'm thinking  he doesn't even know who the fuck she is or anything but he knew exactly everything and he's  fucking playing me off like that go fuck yourself you fucking old man cocksucker go franchise your  shit little makeup band out uh and make a few more bucks drop dead rich good good for you look at gene  fucking in his porno good job that's good yeah lift the gut up there you go now your dick can fit in

[02:56:00]  cringiest moments right now let's take a look back at opie and anthony's cringe moments a selection of  segments that'll make you stare at the radio and say what the f was that holy crap i'm done yes you  just heard what you thought you heard it's opie and anthony's cringe moments  you want to do the meos thing uh yes yes i i got such such bad news yesterday um via text yeah yes 
[02:56:30]  it was hot off the presses like before it even hit google what i'm not getting that about see i thought  you learned about this from the paper it's in the paper today but you learned about the fire at meos  before it hit the papers yes yes i was texted uh as you as you know um i've been raving about a  restaurant in roslin called mio fine italian restaurant it was one of those places i would 
[02:57:00]  go into and uh all the staff knew me and um you know all for me they knew exactly what wine i liked  nice the uh the food fantastic and uh it was right there in roslin and uh i used to go there  well i i found out through a text that uh mio's uh burnt down 20 foot flames i'm reading in the paper 
[02:57:30]  total loss completely devastated you won't be going back there no more no and uh like i said it was  before i i i it wasn't on google it wasn't anywhere i got the news via text and uh this person it was  the first text i had gotten since probably um the end of the summer ah yeah re really yes yes it was it  was text from jill jill texted you to tell you that mio mio burnt to the ground 20 foot flames like i said 
[02:58:00]  what else did she write in the text she just said hey i hear your favorite restaurant burnt  down well i hope you're eating there i hope you and your whores she was just uh hoping you weren't  going to respond meaning that there was a possibility you were in the restaurant well that was one of the 
[02:58:30]  places if you recall during the um very publicized breakup yeah of uh what was called anthelini at the  time and the breakup did involve a fire i just exactly well if you i'm not saying anything i'm  just saying i'm just throwing facts out if you recall the um the uh well what the hell was i going  to say now uh the the american express bills that i would get would say um uh is this when you took  your whore there or is this where you take your whores because like mia would show up a lot she would 
[02:59:00]  circle that on the bill on there yes with a little note with a little note this where you take your  whores and of course um there was an episode where a girl that was at my house lost her clothing to a  fire that was lit by ms nicolini in the backyard of my house in the fire pit so when i heard on the news  news that mio had burned down what they're calling a complete loss by the way a complete loss uh 
[02:59:30]  and getting the news from a text from her it uh certainly was like wow that's ironic don't you think  you actually got the text a day before it burned down  i hear your favorite restaurant burned down in a few days  she's sitting out in front of the place with pesci discussing a date i'm trying to bang this radio 
[03:00:00]  guy henry hey henry yeah help me out here to smoke pouring out of the joint yeah she's trying to get  one of her girlfriends to go out with me but her girlfriend won't just go out with this guy help me  out here yeah heat heat from the fire cracked plate glass windows and deflated globe lamps at  a restaurant across the street across the street and it should be noted the uh news day saying today 
[03:00:30]  that the fire is not considered suspicious well very uh very tragic i would say how does a fire like  that get so big hot and uh just involved so quickly i guess there's a lot of uh i'll tell you a bad  economy cooking oil you think that's how some people do tend to do that in a bad economy you see a lot of  restaurants kind of go up in smoke oh there's a picture of the firemen uh taking care of uh oh it's on 
[03:01:00]  the channel 11 site yeah prominently displayed yeah it sure is mio home of anthony and his whores  yes with a little bias popular eatery and brothel  but she frequented by such scumbags as anthony cumia  but she had to text you yes little tidbit yes it was one of those little things and then she wrote  nothing else did you write her back no no i i wasn't sure if it was you know one of those things like 
[03:01:30]  hey by the way one of your restaurants you know hey burnt down and i was supposed to answer back like  oh wow that's a shame or if it was one of those where it's like yeah i just better delete this  so because you know i don't know if it's meant as a ha ha or you know some conversation but of course  it's a ha i i figured it was a ha ha ha she's been waiting for her shot for a while yeah that was a good 
[03:02:00]  one she got uh she got her shot in that is like if i if i ever went out to eat uh because i usually  have you know my uh my chef make my food you know it's good it's healthy but if i did go out that was  the joint you know that was the place now gone where the hell am i supposed to go fh riley's it's too  far fh riley's for me i mean all right we'll open up uh like uh get another branch there in uh you 
[03:02:30]  know around uh nassau county northern nassau we're gonna do another branch we'll go like to jersey or  something in jersey jersey we're going to jersey uh it's called franchising it by the way you too it's  not called opening another branch oh yeah get a franchise franchise open up uh the jern tanks do  that they open branches you're right uh cody in indiana what's going on yeah even though i live in  indiana i think i have a little insight on the incident yeah i think it was a some sort of a  grease fire i don't know if maybe you know anything about that perhaps it was all right you insiders you 
[03:03:00]  know how uh restaurants can be we've got some insiders they say stuff that only a few people get  more than a few all right well there that sucks for you i'm bummed about it because it was a very  nice place now you certainly went there a lot yeah hogwax on the nipples a crying drunk homeless  man and creepy gay kid sam singing happy birthday to you just some of the cringe moments you'll hear 
[03:03:30]  on opie and anthony's worst of 2008  it's the worst of opie and anthony 2008's cringiest moments i'm primetime sam roberts you know me from  ona and that's eric belching and eating mayonnaise in the background that's not mayonnaise it's cherry  coke zero now uh eric there's nothing better on the opie anthony show than tormenting one of our 
[03:04:00]  guests yes because it means they're not tormenting one of the staff exactly and so when mad tvs or is  that show on the air anymore who formerly watches at this point who knows bobby lee comedian you know  and bobby lee came by the studio and basically started telling us about how paranoid he gets  now why does he get paranoid maybe it's because he had a difficult childhood maybe it's from stress  in the workplace being a celebrity could be or maybe um he's involved in certain substances that 
[03:04:30]  would make one paranoid could be allegedly who knows it could be anything but what we did as a show  the opie and anthony show is we take that information and instead of kind of looking looking  to help him through it we capitalize on it and exploit it and drive him to the point of near suicide  on the worst of opie and anthony 2008's cringiest moments bobby lee freaks out do you think he'll  ever come back i hope so it's opie and anthony's worst of 2008 cringe moments yeah i'll look back at 
[03:05:00]  some of the most uncomfortable yet hilarious portions of the show it's opie and anthony's worst of 2008  cringe moments happy new year time for the line of the day oh that fast already bobby you enjoy your  first visit yeah did you guys make up yeah no we're cool man he's yeah it was weird it's like

[03:25:30]  this is where you shine actually more than participate you finally do something well  by imitating somebody else's uh profession yeah this is of course the uh franchise ona bit that we  started the new generation franchise ona was started in 2008 basically opi and anthony found out that they  had to interview david tyree of the new york giants about thirty minutes before mr tyree came to the  studio they said all this guy did was write a book about one catch he made there's no way we want to 
[03:26:00]  talk to him yes now our guest booker at the time said well we can't cancel him he's coming in a half  hour yes so they said okay he obviously isn't going to know the show we're going to run out of the room  and sit a new opi anthony in our places so let's look at the aftermath and what happened after  patrice's words and opi anthony's decision they put the new opi anthony in place to interview david  tyree of new york giant if i can say you can the next generation of ona franchise i think the best 
[03:26:30]  obviously yes first one was uh a decent model but didn't really i would say i would have said subpar  you know what you're right subpar yeah um almost shameful terrible yes but this is better it's on the  worst of opi and anthony 2008's cringiest moments it's opi and anthony's worst of 2008 cringe moments  i'll look back at some of the most uncomfortable yet hilarious portions of the show from the bottom  of my heart i hope you have a healthy and a happy new year no no no no it's opi and anthony's worst of 
[03:27:00]  2008 cringe moments that's right we're laughing at you stupid he's here he's quiet seriously holy  holy what do we do not in there though oh go hide me too rabbit hide me too all right the franchise  version of the anthony show here it goes

[03:29:30]  today or have you come somewhere else hanging out over channel 11 for a hot minute ah cw 11 we know them  very well very well yes we have some uh history yes that's what's up so uh david what's the deal  you're promoting a book yeah it would be nice if we had a copy of the book somewhere oh there's one  right there take a look at that there i've read it already more than just the catch yeah want to fill 
[03:30:00]  us in a little bit about uh this book here it's a little bit everything you know uh all the crazy  stuff that i that i went through in my life you know uh stemming from the you know just a  crazy young kid growing up drugs alcohol mostly mostly marijuana all that you know all the stuff  that i know a little about that a little bit about that yes a little a lot oh you know here and there  yeah so you know basically uh kind of the struggles that i had any getting up to that point uh you know 
[03:30:30]  obviously being in the nfl um it's not a good mixture you know mm-hmm so uh you know i got a  basically got arrested marijuana possession and that's kind of what led me to my faith and things  like that very nice going through some of the uh the photos here oh yeah i got some classics in there  you dress up pretty nice every now and then you know oh maybe you don't need to flirt with them  hope for this one here what's what's this one all about you've thrown up a gang sign oh yeah that's  like my jim jones i don't you know i don't listen uh cameron and dip set much ah dip set yes 
[03:31:00]  yes yes dip set is a go yeah i was a big fan of the dip set back then so i was just acting a fool  back in the crib i see keep it fun you know so uh you say uh you found your faith yeah uh do you  credit that for making this catch which we're looking at on the cover of the book well you know  yeah you know obviously you know a lot of people when i say it people go get a little wacko like well  you did make the catch i know i made the catch i was kind of there you know so uh you know i just uh 
[03:31:30]  what i mean is that there's no way you know human talent can make that catch you know it's not like  i can prepare for it you know i can go in the park and catch balls on my helmet you know so that's what  i say you know well god did it why do you think god was on the side of the giants no i never said god  was on the side of the giants i just said that uh you know people misconstrue that as well it's not uh  god was on our side is god is looking out for anybody that's you know that's not willing to the famous  name you know what i'm saying so unless you're a patriot there was some there was some pretty good 
[03:32:00]  page i saw some patriots out there that was crushed but you know the will of god is just the will of  god you know whether you win or lose i see i see i see how are you um recovering from your knee injury  here i'm ready to go man i've been ready to go for a couple weeks so first i was a little upset about uh  being on pvp to begin with but you know give me it gave me a little more extra time i needed you know  to be strong and uh i'll be out this week and then i'll be i should be back the next week i wanted  to ask you uh michael strahan now an analyst for fox yeah he just made his pick for the season saying 
[03:32:30]  that dallas is going all the way yeah now uh you were both on the same team last year how are you  taking that now you know he's got a job to do but you know it it sucked i thought he could have went  out there and uh and gave us a little bit of love for the first one but at the same time you know he  got a job to do and uh yeah you know you just go out there and do his job and we do all you know  if we could get um my brother elmo big fan of the giants just obsessed with his team we can get him 
[03:33:00]  on the phone sometime i know you have a lot of questions he'd like to ask you oh sweet  mars why isn't this monitor working again it's oh there it goes go ahead over i'm sorry no there's  no problem yeah so it's just odd michael is um we haven't had him on in a while but he used to  come on the show regularly and uh makes trey huh yeah yeah he's he's big time now how is um how  is he doing as far as i don't want to go into too much detail but like his things that were going  on with his personal life last year and uh has he discussed any of that with you no i never discussed 
[03:33:30]  it you know he's he's not ashamed of it so uh you know he'll willingly say he'll willingly say you  know he made every every conscious effort that she wouldn't get all his money but at the same time you  know if things worked out the way they did that's his personal business i don't really do too much  getting into that stuff no no that's that's that's a little dangerous you know especially when the  guys got weighs me about about 80 pounds i'll leave it alone how you feel about jerry rice as a  player ah well he's my childhood hero to be honest with you i was never a new york fan i was a 49ers 
[03:34:00]  fan because i grew up you know late 80s the niners was running the show so because sometimes around  here we go we do an impression jerry dice jerry dice yeah that was new i never got that one yeah  but um jerry rice he's a solid dude you ever met him no no we just do jerry dice  you know yeah but um yeah that's pretty much it loving this book here i do have to ask you um about 
[03:34:30]  plaques to go oh yeah that's that's that's how do you say brass brass and burst burst burst  well he was suspended for missing practice uh allegedly saying that he took his kids to school  uh that was the excuse for why he missed practice okay yes you know anything about that that's the  first that's the first i heard because you know i'm just not being i don't read too much babies i knew  you know i just i'm reading here his supposedly bizarre excuse um that's tough you know that's 
[03:35:00]  tough you know we we men that don't get a chance to do that too often so um if that's the case i  got a little i got sympathy for it but yet at the same time you know he's a grown man he's and we're  grown enough to make decisions for ourselves you know and that's that's what we got to do you know  you got to make decisions if you know you got to be at work it's eventually going to cost you but  hey you just got a new contract have you uh miss practice legitimate a reason or not but uh  has that ever happened to you at any point in your career rookie yeah heck yeah i got i was like  leading the team of fines my rookie year when i was uh and i was just a wreck that year yeah you know 
[03:35:30]  i think i had about ten thousand dollars in fines but it should have been 40. nothing during your  college days i see that you went to syracuse our old anthony went to syracuse did you no i didn't even  graduate high school oh that was supposed to be the setup yeah no i didn't i didn't uh graduate high  school in radio we can do that make this career there's no reason phenomenal we have uh  a fan somewhere outside that wants to say one fan yeah that's i'm good for one where is he yeah 
[03:36:00]  hi this is steven s from uh bayshore and uh i'm watching the show today um opie you're you're such  a phony um you were saying how much the giant sock and big blue blows and all that you're you're  you're a jets fan i am a big here you are kissing david tyree's ass i i i don't really understand  all right that's going on here we'll leave it to steven s from bayshore to sell out opie  david uh i have to level with you i am a jets fan grew up on long island hey you're mad at you dude 
[03:36:30]  you're in the prime of your life right now brett farve's in town yeah well i'm not too big uh  too big to support brett farve either i think he's a big sellout  tell him what you were saying the other day you know that uh you know this guy's a one-hit wonder  i mean all he has in his career is one catch you were saying it just the other day all right  opie if you could uh maybe pop that mic down a bit way to make me uh feel uh big about myself here  satellite radio yeah i was uh just saying that i thought you know book because you caught a football 
[03:37:00]  on your head uh you know what's the deal what's the deal why a book why a book yeah because i got a  story to tell why you got a radio show oh every day we wonder the same thing they keep paying us that's  that's it do you think anybody could have predicted that catch that you made no that's  that's the best part about it because i could i think the only way you could have predicted a catch  like that is if you had had some kind of sports almanac like biff tannen did if you could get like uh 
[03:37:30]  here we go again machine and uh and tune out for 20 minutes there head to the future  get the sports almanac i'm sure there'd be a little footnote in there about that catch  because it would obviously say you know the giants end of the patriots you know winning streak  definitely and i'll bet uh i bet i could create an entire museum dedicated to myself based on the  money that i would get uh from that prediction as well as others that would be phenomenal because  i started a movie with you the sequel yeah which is your favorite back to the future part two really 
[03:38:00]  yeah all the futuristic the hoverboards phenomenal yeah can't beat it we had a guest in that their  favorite was part three they weren't invited back no thank you no uh where did they get those right  the logs to power to power that you know the train i don't even know i don't think part three got  another i didn't even give it another one no no part one and two phenomenal yeah let's um you want  to take a phone call a couple listeners calling in some supporters um support maybe not this one 
[03:38:30]  we're on in boston okay and uh so this is brian in mass brian you're on with mike ah with david tyree  sorry hello hi brian hi yes david uh quick question i love the book it's called the catch correct  yeah more than just the catch yeah yeah i'm uh i'm a uh a patriots fan and i was just looking at some  stats online can you tell me about the other three catches last year the three catches what's the point  they're talking about those i don't know i just saw online the four catch season last year yeah 
[03:39:00]  those uh what what happened to the other three catches do they have a chapter  boy you you just really missed the whole season didn't you like i didn't even the four catches  didn't even matter isn't that the whole gist of it oh okay okay yeah geez all right thank you brian  this isn't a book about all the catches he caught the thing on his head with his fingertips for god's  sake let's talk to um from yellowstone lady trucker lady hello hello david yeah what's going on 
[03:39:30]  hey how old were you when you first played football when i first played i don't know i'm 11 or 12  david believes the shit the white hole shrink babbles i don't even know what that meant  what that meant sometimes we get prank callers here and uh and there's not much we could do about  it except maybe talk to a different phone screener you know what i mean i'm sorry about that good stuff 
[03:40:00]  let's talk to uh take one more here cody in indiana cody cody yeah how are you what's going on cody  hey uh i i know that that you uh you probably think that it's all part of divine intervention for an  amazing catch like that was it anything like the movie angels in the outfield to you  hmm anything like angel in the outfield um i don't know if you could see my angels yeah  christopher lloyd is just amazing i think he he crystallizes it experience like that perfectly 
[03:40:30]  and and if it was anything like that i mean that's amazing well we all know christopher lloyd's  amazing he created the flux capacitor after all you know yeah well have a good day david thank  you hey take it easy boss i mean who would have thought that one person could take a car like  the delorean you know and then you a little plutonium a flux capacitor and you know it's  flying through the sky that's phenomenal into the future 88 miles per hour is all you need can't beat 
[03:41:00]  that they could send a dog einstein they could send you know it's a nice setup oh well yeah this is our  very own uh xm studio serious xm now i guess since the merger but yeah they built the studio just for  us in the rock ron and fez show that comes on after us from noon to three this is sweet yes another uh  question about a teammate of yours tiki barber um yeah tiktok career suicide going to the today show  missed out on the ring he did you guys still talk to him nobody still talk to him you know i think he's 
[03:41:30]  had enough you know you know i'm sure he's almost he's regretting the situation but you know it was  kind of rough when he threw us under the bus at the beginning of the season you know we started off  on two and he's like giants are pitiful and uh you know so i think those you know you know he paid for  it you know and there's no reason for us to rub it in his face you know he did some good things for us  yeah i think we uh have another audience member who has a question what's the deal you're up how could you  where is he softballs at this guy david do you know that that that op guy right there he doesn't 
[03:42:00]  believe in god and he makes fun of people that believe in god he's there we go that's why i'm  here that's what i'm here for that's uh we're not practicing going to church wise but i don't think  i'm totally not into the god thing i just uh i'm very skeptical i can understand people are skeptics  you know what you got they got reason to be skeptics you know when you look at so many hypocrites out  there it's not it's not a hypocrite that's a lot of reason and uh since we're sharing i i got to uh 
[03:42:30]  admit something else this is uh yeah confession this is yeah this is uh this is greg hughes the uh  the actor who plays opi um i know i said i was a jets fan i really haven't been into football  for a while now um i'm all about the tiger woods golf so you playing that no i'm on the ps3 sucking games  that's not video games it's not you know what's the madden rules like 21 nothing you're off right  yeah off the sticks i gave up like three years ago they just kept 21 skunking me oh if you get the new

[03:47:30]  they said it's all t's i i prefer to think that this was the best stunt ever because of the way it  was executed by those who were involved in executing well now you're just tooting your own horn i didn't  say it was me was it you it was me yeah well and rich boss that's true it was the baby diaper mustache  opie had made an open challenge a couple of times he said if anyone has a baby come down to the studio  today only bring that dirty diaper and i'll wear what's in the diaper as a mustache and i knew 
[03:48:00]  voss was in town because he was coming by later to cut some promos for me right because he had done  this before opie had done this before knowing that nobody would ever bring a baby yeah so he tried he  got he got a little cocky did it for either a second or third time i don't remember and you made the call  yeah and voss arrived couldn't get here fast enough dirty diaper in hand ladies and gentlemen  this is the baby diaper mustache on the worst of opie and anthony 2008's cringiest moments

[04:03:00]  He fell on the floor.  He fell on the floor.  He did it.  He took two fingers, wiped it right under his nose.  Now he can't get the smell out of his head.  Oh, no, he's kissed.  He's got the diaper in his hand.  I didn't do it.  Where is he?  He's going.  All right, he's running off to the bathroom. 
[04:03:30]  Holy shit.  What a fucking prop act.  I'll see you guys later.  Take it easy, Bobby.  Thanks, man.  Oh, my God.  Voss, I fucking love you.  I fucking love you.  I really didn't think he'd do that.  I fucking love Laz.  I'll see you later.  I did not think he would do that.  This is the best show I've ever fucking done, ever.  I'll see you guys.  I'm going to puke.  Because Opie's rarely on the receiving end of any of that stuff.  Literally, that shit.  And to see him, actually, he took two fingers full on his index fingers and smeared it right 
[04:04:00]  under his nose.  And the worst part is he hesitated.  He held his fingers right under his nose for a minute.  And then kept going back and forth with him.  And then, after he finished throwing up, he tried to wipe it off.  And then he just had green shit smeared it.  And it went on his lip.  Like, now it was so close to his mouth.  It was a big wad.  It wasn't just like...  Yeah, yeah.  Dude, that shit is green.  That baby shit was green. 
[04:04:30]  Alien fucking green.  You guys called me one day and said you...  Oh, what a picture.  That's it.  E-Rock's showing me a still picture.  Opie's horrified and just got baby shit smeared all under his nose.  I am so disgusted.  A new low.  A brand new low on the Opie and Anthony show.  I didn't think it could be done.  When he picked up that diaper and ran around, I'm sure it was going to go into E-Rock's face.  Oh, yeah.  It should have.  Oh.  It's still in the garbage can. 
[04:05:00]  Oh.  You can still put it in your face.  You look winded.  Dude.  Voss.  Voss, it's in the garbage pail if you want to put it with the rest of your act in a notebook or something.  Dude.  Let me tell you something.  Sorry, sir.  You said you watered down my joke from earlier.  Oh, I did?  Fuck.  Per usual, I wasn't listening to you.  Wow.  Voss comes through.  Let me tell you something.  All right.  Yeah.  Opie, please.  Describe it for the people. 
[04:05:30]  What's it like to smear baby shit under your nose for really nothing?  Oh, my God.  Like, people would do that for a $10,000 bet, maybe.  Right.  Or ratings.  Like, you string it out over a few days over at K-Rock.  Dude.  Ten grand.  You smear baby shit under your nose.  Fuck you.  And you did it for the show.  Dude.  Oh, my God.  It's still.  Get me a fucking razor immediately.  You need something.  No, dude.  I can't get it out of my mustache.  Yeah.  I have never been.  You want the big baby shit? 
[04:06:00]  No.  I need a razor.  I'm not even fucking kidding.  It's got four blades.  Don't kill yourself over it.  Dude.  I've never been more grossed out and sicker in my life.  Wow.  I just fucking puked so much.  Go look at the toilet in the bathroom.  And I'm telling you, I'm one of these guys that takes a lot for me to puke.  There's a FedEx package here.  This was fast.  It's a diamond ring from Lindsay.  Thank God she's at yoga today.  Oh, you don't want to listen to Replay. 
[04:06:30]  It was just a regular show today.  Yeah.  Dude, I fucking don't feel right.  Jeez, you went from like that.  It's called hepatitis.  Yeah, right?  Has that kid been inoculated?  You went from like the top radio host in the country to an intern.  Yeah.  Yeah, you did.  You fucking.  Man, you know what?  I'm a man of my word, though.  You can't now say he's not.  You guys outsmarted me, which is not easy, you fuckers, because I swear to God, I'll take  you inside the thing completely.  I was like, there's no fucking way anyone will ever get to the studio in time. 
[04:07:00]  So every once in a while, we'll throw this on the air like as a goof, baby diaper mustache,  knowing there's no fucking way.  But these motherfuckers were in cahoots and outsmarted me.  That doesn't happen.  It all just came together.  It certainly did.  And you played it perfectly.  Did you come in and get his first appearance?  I got it from the point when he was like, you realized that Bonnie wasn't here. 
[04:07:30]  And then, you know, you guys were just talking and then he pulled the diaper out and you were  like, oh, my God.  You had no clue I had a diaper on me?  No.  I thought it was off the hook because when I saw your face, I'm like, oh, shit, they're  in town for a doctor's visit.  You've done it before.  And then when you came in, you acted perfectly.  Like, what are you talking about?  And then when I set up the bid, like, oh, thank God I'm off the hook.  And you go, well, bam, and you show the diaper.  Can you cut where he just said you acted perfectly?  Can we get that anywhere on TV or something?  You acted. 
[04:08:00]  The keyword would be acted perfectly.  Yeah.  Okay.  You know what?  Tell Chaz about that.  Next time you talked to Palomari or whatever his name is.  Where did Bobby go?  Yeah, he had to go to a little audition callback or something.  But there's just something about Bobby vomiting that is the funniest fucking thing.  I will always laugh my ass off when Bob Kelly pukes.  It's the sound.  It's what he's puking at.  I used to think it was a bit, too, until you see it live. 
[04:08:30]  No, no.  You can actually see him convulsing physically.  His whole head turns beet red.  You see how his audience feels?  Can we take a break?  I need to.  Yeah, we'll take a break.  You probably should scrub under there with maybe lemons or something.  Dude, I'm getting sick all over again because it's in my mustache.  Not that I have a mustache.  I didn't shave the last three days.  You got a little stubble.  It's even worse because it's easier to get caught in stubble than a mustache.  You just wipe it out of a mustache.  It's going to be great.  It's going to be a little bit of a bell crow.  In a few days when he has chicken pox. 
[04:09:00]  All the baby diseases.  You're going to have baby diseases.  The mumps.  He'll have all the baby diseases.  Rubella.  You have rubella.  You're going to have a little balloon following you.  Wow, that was an old one.  Jesus Christ.  Why don't you just go back to polio, you fucking fossil?  Like when I can make old jokes.  Two minutes ago, I was a king.  Yeah, that's how this place works.  One minute you're a king, the next you got baby shit under your nose. 
[04:09:30]  I don't even know what you guys said.  I am so fucking out of it right now.  Well, I guess you should be.  Because I got all hyped out, the adrenaline and everything.  You know, if you make it sound.  And then puked in the bathroom.  You make it sound too much like you got a buzz off of it.  All the kids.  All the kids are going to be rubbing baby shit under their nose.  By the way, Blotto from Blotto 98 Detroit.  Patrice equals bluffing puss wad.  Opie equals man of his word.  What a difference a week makes.  Yeah, because Patrice was supposed to take a fucking strap on up the butt last week.  Well, you know, I'm not saying baby shit under your nose is a treat by any stretch of the imagination. 
[04:10:00]  But Patrice getting fucked in the ass with a dildo and him backing out of that might...  I could see a little justification.  See, you've got to just trick Patrice and tell him it's a cattle prod.  Dude, what do I wipe under my nose?  I really don't know what gets the smell of baby shit out of a man's mustache stubble.  You should ask a few pedophiles.  They can help you out.  Adult shit. 
[04:10:30]  Cover it up.  Doesn't Bob Kelly owe him $100 for that diaper?  Yeah, Bob owes you $100.  Watch that.  He said if something comes in, $100 guaranteed.  Oh, that's right.  $100 cash, buddy.  Fuck him.  Dude, I need something for my nose.  I'm begging.  I'm begging.  I'm begging.  I would think probably lemon.  What do we got?  I'm serious.  See, you should have kept some ketchup.  Sam in Jersey, what's up?  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey.  Radio gold. 
[04:11:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, that...  I never...  I really didn't think you were going to do it.  I would say radio green.  Dude, I actually...  When I looked at the diaper the first time,  and then what really got me  was when I put the gloves on  and then I, like, smear,  like you would baby...  I can't even talk.  Like, finger paint.  And it was now a nice glove  on each index finger.  Yeah.  I started getting lightheaded.  I started to go to a safe place.  Yeah, maybe...  Do we have a cleaning product? 
[04:11:30]  Maybe, like, a dab a little Lysol?  No joke.  I gotta go do something.  Yeah.  Do whatever you gotta do.  Put that in a paper towel  and dab it in your whiskers.  Back to the Laszlo and Anthony show.  Yeah, let me...  Laszlo, I've had something to confess  for quite a while.  Now, we'll take a break  while Opie fucking tries  to get baby shit out  from under his nose.  I can't believe you did that.  Leave some breadcrumbs  back to your dignity.  We'll be right back.  Ladies and gentlemen,  this is called  Baby Diaper Mustache.  Baby Diaper Mustache.  How the fuck am I gonna do this? 
[04:12:00]  You're gonna stick your fingers in there  and do it quick.  It's not a big deal.  It's like food,  only, you know,  in the second stage.  Food in the second stage  is called shit, Rich.  Let's do it.  Manna!  Oh my God!  Look at that boy!  This is a new wall.  Do it!  A new fucking wall.  Let me do it!  Oh my God, no.  Oh God.  Open!  Oh no!  Oh my God, no! 
[04:12:30]  Oh no!  That is fucking disgusting.  Hot wax on the nipples.  Ah!  A crying, drunk, homeless man.  And creepy gay kid Sam singing.  Happy birthday to you.  Just some of the cringe moments  you'll hear on Opie and Anthony's  Worst of 2008.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony's  2008. 
[04:13:00]  Cringiest moments.  E-Rock, primetime Sam Roberts  joining you today while the guys  are on vacation.  Technically, we're on vacation too,  but...  We're never on vacation to E-Rock.  There's something that people  don't realize.  We're so dedicated.  There's E-Rock and Sam,  and those two don't stop working.  No.  It's New Year's Day,  and we're still chilling in the studio  with you people listening to some  of our favorite bits,  the bits that have made us cringe  the most in 2008.  What's the company made us coming in?  Well, you know,  we're underlings right now.  Yes.  One day, E-Rock.  Are we getting paid for this?  No.  Of course not.  No.  What do we have here?  Ah, wait a minute. 
[04:13:30]  Of course I know what we have here.  This is something that will make  my partner here a little uneasy.  This, I just see the list here.  This is getting on the cringiest moments  because it makes me cringe.  Yes.  It's when Seth Green came into studio.  And the way this worked out is  you're living a real-life entourage  scenario here.  Mm-hmm.  And it involves Seth Green,  who is also on Entourage.  Right.  But you're doing the whole  E versus Seth Green  battling back and forth  over a girl.  Well, the thing is,  my girlfriend had said 
[04:14:00]  she wanted to meet Seth Green.  And she'd never come into studio  to meet anybody.  She's just not the type.  Yeah.  But I said, you know,  come in, meet Seth Green,  get a DVD sign,  take a little picture and everything.  Well, the powers that be  thought it necessary  to bring her in studio.  Your girlfriend's cute.  Well, thank you.  Yeah.  I guess.  That's why they brought her in.  It wasn't because of you.  No, it wasn't.  They think she's hot.  She, they do.  So, everybody oogles her  with her eyes.  And they call her and text her.  Yes.  Pay way too much attention to her.  Yes.  But hey, it means they're nice to me 
[04:14:30]  when she's around.  It's nice to have the host  of two major radio shows  flirting with your girlfriend.  In a way.  I see it as a career plus.  All right.  Well, I mean, yeah,  it's not hurting my career.  Nope.  Although, there's certainly  no breaking up with her.  No.  That would be detrimental  to my career.  Yes, because then nobody  would focus any attention  on you at all.  No, why wouldn't they?  But she focused her own  attention on Seth Green  and this is it.  It made me cringe.  You'll probably just laugh at me.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  I have pictures of your chick here  I'll just look at  while we're listening to that bit.  Then you pick it up. 
[04:15:00]  Opie and Anthony,  2008 cringiest moments.  Sam and E. Rock  will be right back.  It's Opie and Anthony's  worst of 2008 cringe moments.  Yeah.  I'll look back  at some of the most uncomfortable  yet hilarious portions  of the show.  Three, two,  Happy New Year.  Happy New Year.  It's Opie and Anthony's  worst of 2008 cringe moments.  Happy New Year.  Hey, we got to put someone 
[04:15:30]  on the spot.  Yes, Jess,  you're coming in  and asking a question.  This is Sam's girlfriend.  She never comes to work  with Sam ever, ever, ever.  But today she did  because she's a huge fan  of Seth Green.  Oh, I signed a DVD for him.  Why don't you sit down  over there?  Jess, sit over there.  You're a star.  Don't worry.  You don't have to  hover over her.  She'll be fine without you  for a second.  Now, you've never been  in studio with us before?  Never.  First time for everything?  Yep, I've been on the phone  but never in studio.  Right.  How long have you and Sam  been together?  Actually, it's three years tomorrow. 
[04:16:00]  Oh, congratulations.  Way to hold on.  Wow.  They might be getting engaged.  Well, I heard that  he's looking at rings, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's always the way  you want to hear it, too.  On the radio.  Right.  So you're a huge  Seth Green fan?  Yeah, I am.  I've been a fan since forever.  Oh, thanks.  Can't Hardly Wait  is my favorite movie.  Oh, we just did a commentary  for that because it's  like 10 years now.  For real?  Sam, for our anniversary.  I could take that.  Merry Christmas.  I've got to be stupid.  Can't Hardly Wait  what was that about? 
[04:16:30]  It was kind of the resurgence  of teen comedy movies.  There was a point in time  where they weren't making  any movies like this  and this was a throwback  to John Husey-style movies.  Nice.  Yeah, it's the best.  I've got to have sex tonight.  It sounds like you're in luck, Sam.  So do you have a question  for Seth Green?  Well, I actually want to know  where were you born?  In Philadelphia.  Oh, really?  But you were in the media  and everything since day one.  How did that happen?  Well, not technically day one.  I've actually been pretty fortunate  to avoid the media 
[04:17:00]  for the most part.  I find that tabloid media  doesn't really care about comedians.  You look at like Sasha Cohen  or Ben Stiller  or any of those guys,  they don't really care.  And since I don't have sex  with anybody famous visibly,  no one bothers me.  It's great.  I mean, that works definitely.  But as far as movies,  how old were you  when you got started?  I did my first acting job,  like professional acting job  when I was seven  and I did my first feature  when I was eight.  Were you independently motivated  or was it something other?  Yeah, no, I was lucky enough  to have direction  when I was very young. 
[04:17:30]  All right, I'm sitting back.  I'm just going to chase that.  I'm just going to sit back.  Not work.  I like this.  Not the funniest of interviews.  No, no, no.  My favorite part so far  is the way Jess said,  so you were in the media spotlight  since day one  and Seth said,  no, I really haven't been much.  And she went, okay, good.  And then just continued with that.  Day one.  She already has follow-up questions  and everything.  I know.  We usually are like,  humm-a-humm-a-humm-a-humm-a-humm-a.  Yeah, I just wanted to point out.  It's almost like  this is what prep sounds like.  I know.  Like, I don't know  what prep sounds like.  Us, us.  I'm surprised Jess 
[04:18:00]  to come in here  and like talk to  one of her favorite celebrities  and she can speak  like a human being.  I know.  But anytime any wrestler  comes in here  and you're like,  Sam, ask him questions,  I just collapse.  Look at Sam's first  self-deprecating piece of humor  right there.  Only because  it was in defense of his girl.  Well, yeah.  You are  Well played, Sam.  Whipped.  You are so whipped.  What are you talking about?  What do you think of the hair?  I'm so ready for him to shave it.  It's got to go?  I was hoping that I could maybe shave it.  Really?  Yep.  I'm thinking about it. 
[04:18:30]  Sam, all I can tell you  is that it is a valuable thing  to shave your head  at least once in your life.  I recommend several times myself.  This hair is the mane  of a champion  from Afro Wars.  Then I recommend you  cut it into a glorious mohawk.  Thank you.  That would actually be very cool.  Afro Wars is over.  You got a robot chicken  question for him?  No, not that I can think of.  I mean, I'm impressed  with how dynamic his career has been  that he produces  as well as acts.  And I just want to say thank you.  Thank you.  Well, I thank you.  Thank you for letting me come in. 
[04:19:00]  She's so gracious.  She's falling apart.  Yes.  Now she's falling apart.  We got to just let her sit there  for two more minutes  and it's going to get ugly.  I want to see her  completely degenerate  into a puddle.  Yeah.  I'm going to have a smile  of red now.  You're getting a little...  You're going to start  doing the Chris Farley  interview really soon.  That was awesome.  Oh my gosh,  when you were wearing  that blue shirt.  Yeah.  And you had the headset on.  That was so cool.  There's nothing worse  than when it's going really well  and all of a sudden  you just run out of steam. 
[04:19:30]  Oh, that's the worst.  Are you implying  that's what happened?  Well, that's what happened to us.  That's why we invited Jess in.  It's happened to me  every time I've talked  to somebody who I admire.  I start off gangbusters.  Who's on that list?  Anybody in Black Sabbath.  Ozzy.  A lot of actors.  There is one...  He's actually wearing  a Black Sabbath shirt.  It's all about Ozzy.  He's the biggest  Ozzy Black Sabbath fan  and he did an interview.  Are the Osbournes  going to come through  here for the new show?  Hopefully, yeah.  We just had her on the phone.  I think...  Oh, you mean for the Variety show? 
[04:20:00]  Yeah.  I'd love the Variety show, yeah.  I'd pay my own airfare  to perform on that.  There's an interview, though,  that Jimmy did  with Black Sabbath  and who were you talking to  about the dress?  It was Zach.  Zach Weil.  All right, it was Zach Weil.  And...  Do we have that clip?  He...  Why would he rock...  Oh, sorry.  He...  I'm not really...  ...asks a question  that is just a rambling,  babbling mess  of a question  and we find it very funny.  We're going to find that.  It's very endearing.  It's nice because 
[04:20:30]  it's Jimmy being honestly taken  sitting there in front  of one of his childhood heroes.  No, no, Zach wasn't...  Zach I like a lot.  Sabbath, I was so blown away  because I got to interview them  one-on-one.  I was so horrified  that I was actually good.  Like, it was almost like  I was beyond being terrified.  You were much better than I was.  Well, sometimes you just shock yourself  into an abject reality.  Like, I've met people  that I'm so impressed by  and, you know,  the burden's on me  to act normal  so you actually have  some kind of valuable  interaction with them.  It is, you know, 
[04:21:00]  but sometimes in that moment  you're so freaked out  that you wind up  being crazy normal.  Who blew you away?  Like, who did you want to meet  that you met  that was like, oh?  I bumped into Denzel Washington  like by accident.  We were both at  Show West in Vegas  coming out of like  interview boots  and I literally bumped  right into him  and had a moment  where I was like,  oh, hey, Seth,  nice to meet you.  Shook his hand.  I was like,  your movie looks really good.  I'm excited to see it.  That kind of thing.  How do you deal  with this kind of press?  It seems like  a weird sensation,  this, that,  and the other thing  and barely had  three lines into it  and then Burt Reynolds 
[04:21:30]  who was in the movie  that I had done  goes, Denzel  and just like  pushes him into a corner  and just corners him  and starts having  a conversation with him  and I just,  I totally let that happen  and the thing about Burt,  no one denies him.  Burt pushes you  into a corner  to have a conversation.  You are in that corner  having a conversation.  Hey, yeah.  Did Denzel know you,  right?  He knew you were.  He didn't give  any indication  to know who you were.  Oh, no.  Come on.  But did he treat you  like a fanboy  or did he like to treat you like...  No, he was nice.  He's a classy gentleman.  He's got to know  who you are.  I don't know that. 
[04:22:00]  I never put it  past anybody.  He's in the piss.  You should have mentioned X.  You should have said  you certainly should have  gotten the best actor  for X.  Why'd they give that  to Pacino?  It would have won him  right over.  It would have hugged you  for that.  Sounds like pandering.  No, it's true.  We got the Jimmy thing  asking about the dress.  Let's hear it.  He did something  in a dress.  I don't,  it was fucking,  it was in Philadelphia.  Perhaps that wasn't played  on the other side  of reality.  That's the F word.  Make sure that we can 
[04:22:30]  play this.  That's funny.  I love when we do that.  It's so funny  because obviously  we do a show  from 9 to 11  on XM,  satellite radio.  Where you don't have  to beat it down.  Yeah, and there's no,  you know,  you can say  whatever you want.  So whenever  something comes to mind  we forget whether  it was done here  or over there  and sometimes  like cold  just like that  we pop it in a play  and it's just like  okay,  I forgot about  that little thing  called the FCC.  We can always play  the banana clip  that happened last week  with Gene Simmons  where you offered him 
[04:23:00]  your banana.  We had Gene Simmons  on the show  and that was an adventure.  Have you guys  had him in here?  Yeah, he's an ass.  He's just an ass.  I'll tell you what,  he brought his son  with him,  his son Nick  who is hilariously cool.  That kid came in  and he came to do  a couple bits  on the show too.  The kid's a really  good actor first of all.  Sharp as hell  took direction  but Gene,  because I've met him  a couple times before  and he had no recollection  of any of those times  but when his kid  came in  his kid was just  busting his balls 
[04:23:30]  relentlessly  and to see  a father-son dynamic  between Gene Simmons  and his son  is hilarious.  Yeah, he was  busting Gene's balls?  Like crazy  because Gene's in the booth  and every single time  he does something  Nick would just click over  and he's like  that was great  dad.  Gene was hungry  and wanted  Jimmy's bananas  really quick.  How was it  because the roasting  Gene was  Can I take a bite?  Sure, you can have  the whole thing.  I'll actually share it  with you if you want. 
[04:24:00]  You know the banana?  He saw a moment there  where he could share  a piece of fruit  with Gene Simmons.  How do you not?  Who would want to though?  Yeah, why?  You go, I'll share it  with you if you want.  You know what it is?  It's the fact that he  offered him the whole  banana first  and then had this  quick second thought  like, no wait  I could share it with him.  And that'll be a moment  for me.  And then I'll say  that I shared it with him.  Maybe both our mouths  touch it at the same time.  Yeah.  I'm just putting that  out there.  Do a little double dung  banana action  while you eat it? 
[04:24:30]  What are you doing?  I've done nothing  but humiliate myself  in front of KISS members.  I've just humiliated  myself in front of them.  Roland has a question  for Seth, I hear.  Roland?  Ah, Roland's kidding.  Are you setting him up,  you rock?  And Jess, you gotta have  one final question  for Seth Green.  Maybe a little family guy  question or something.  We haven't even talked  about KISS here.  Did you get a picture  at least?  No, I'd love a picture.  We better get it quick.  I have got to go.  Here's Roland.  Roland?  Yeah, hello.  Hey Roland.  Do you have a question  for Seth Green? 
[04:25:00]  I don't think so.  No, you do.  You told me it.  Go ahead.  Oh, no.  I just saw him.  No, I will not make out  with you, Roland.  Aw.  The new Star Wars  Robot Chicken DVD,  the commentary.  Yes, way to bring it  back to subject.  Thank you.  The special features,  which are really cool,  two hours of extra.  He talks about,  he got Burt Reynolds  and Dom DeLuise  together,  first time in 15 years.  That's on the first season  of Robot Chicken,  yeah,  in the special features.  I did a movie  with Burt Reynolds  and befriended him 
[04:25:30]  and fell desperately  in love with him  as most people do  when they're in his presence  and got invited  to dinner at his house  that Dom had cooked.  That's a call  you like to get.  He's like,  hey Seth,  it's Burt.  I just wanted to let you know  Dom's cooking tonight.  It'd be great  if you came by.  And I was like,  I will be there,  dude.  I'm totally coming.  And so I sweet talked him  into coming and doing the show  and they did like  a cannonball run bit  in the first season  which is on our DVD.  What's your favorite  Burt Reynolds moment  on film?  In his films  or in our film?  Yeah, his films.  Oh man, 
[04:26:00]  anytime he smiles on camera  it's just glorious.  Sorry, Seth.  Roland's very ticklish.  What happened over there?  He's very ticklish.  Roland being tickled.  He laughs like a little boy.  It's so sweet.  Watch, watch, watch.  He's not faking that.  You might want to put that  on Robot Chicken  because it's just bizarre, man.  He just loses it.  You all right?  Do you realize 
[04:26:30]  you just did  what everyone does to us?  Blah, blah.  Don't put this on your show.  He'll be putting us  in Robot Chicken.  Yeah, before you know it,  he'll be talking about  don't tell him anything.  He'll go on his radio show.  All about the boys  on the radio.  Don't you love  when people do that?  It's my favorite.  Yeah, don't talk  in front of him.  It'll end up on his show.  People pitch me sketches  all the time.  Really?  Yeah, and people  don't understand.  But it's very interesting  because you get to see  exactly what people think 
[04:27:00]  the show is  versus what it actually is.  It was like,  here's the scene.  Batman is really  giving it to  Strawberry Shortcake.  Okay?  And she's like,  oh, my berries,  my berries.  And he says,  I am the knight.  Ha ha!  And you're just like,  A, there is no  legal defensible parody  in that joke whatsoever.  Not to mention the fact  that it is  unbelievably unfunny.  And this is,  I have to shatter  people's dreams  all the time  by telling them  they're a sketch guy.  How do you let them  off the hook?  That's funny.  Do you let them off the hook? 
[04:27:30]  I usually explain  exactly how we write the show  and how different  our process is  from what people think it is  and the jokes  that people come up with,  how arbitrary  the, you know,  the combinations  of elements are  and just how diligently  we work  to make things  actually make sense  so that we don't get sued.  Ah, that's the key.  Yeah.  Jess, anything else?  Family guy?  I knew you were  going to ask me.  Aside from Robot Chicken,  do you have any movies  or anything coming up  that, because I want to  I actually made  two movies this year  one of which won't be out  until next year  one that's coming out 
[04:28:00]  in October  I think this movie  called Sex Drive  with Clark Duke  and James Marsden  where I play an Amish kid  and next year,  April, I think  they're putting it out  this movie I do  with John Travolta  and Rob Williams  called Old Dogs.  Very cool.  Big old family comedy  for you and your kids.  You're back.  That sounds very good.  Well, I'll be there.  I hope so.  Why does it take so long  for the movies to come out?  Well, this actually,  you know, this had to do  with the writer's strike  and the way that Disney  organized the release slate  kind of in anticipation  of a work stoppage.  They pushed a couple of movies 
[04:28:30]  and that way they had  at least a staggered slate  in case they couldn't  make any other films.  And then we reshot  the whole ending, so.  Oh.  That'll do it.  We're going to end with this.  Sorry, Jimmy.  What is it?  Jimmy asking Zach Wilde  about the dress.  Oh, but they bleeped the F-bomb.  Yeah.  It's just stupid.  I like the idea of a fan  asking questions like that  who's not used to it  because it's like a thrill.  It's like you take  forward to meeting people.  Well, let's really get into this.  Would you blow off Sam  for Seth Green?  Absolutely.  It would be real easy, right?  Absolutely.  It wouldn't even be a problem. 
[04:29:00]  I said to Sam.  That's awkward  because I'm not looking  for a relationship.  You wouldn't even think twice, right?  Not at all.  Sam would be so gone.  Oh, Sam.  Sam, don't take that shit.  I mean, that stuff.  Yeah, without a doubt.  I mean, we would...  You would just leave your stuff  in the apartment, right?  Well, we'd live together, I guess.  Yeah, but you would just...  You'd be like,  I don't need that anymore.  Yeah.  Did you have a crush on Seth  at any point?  You're very handsome, dude.  I still do have a crush on Seth.  I love him.  You guys are so silly.  And thank you.  You watch Buffy a lot?  Oh, yeah. 
[04:29:30]  Me and my dad,  we watch Buffy all the time.  Wow.  All right.  Sam's a little red sheet.  He's a little embarrassed.  Yeah, he...  But Sam would understand, right?  Dude, you can't hold a camera.  You have to understand that one.  You're holding a camera  for this dumb show.  Yeah.  And he's Seth.  What are you going to do?  But who's the girl on your list?  I mean, who's the girl  that would walk you out?  Oh, John Cena.  He has a big crush.  John Cena.  He's got a big crush on who?  Kristen Bell.  Oh, she's great, my buddy.  You had her in,  the little blonde girl.  Oh, really?  She's on the hero. 
[04:30:00]  She's on the Veronica.  That and Beyonce.  She's making that face for me.  All right.  She's all right.  Beyonce?  Beyonce.  Kristen Bell is like  nerd delight, though.  For a second,  I thought you said  Kristen Bell.  Kristen Bell.  No, that's my crush.  Right.  So that doesn't offend you  at all a little bit  to hurt your feelings?  Now, Sam,  you've got to understand that.  I mean, I understand  it'd be better  if he wasn't,  like, for instance,  in the room.  It's awkward.  It's awkward  if he's in the room.  See, because when girls  usually, you know,  99.9% of the American public,  if the guy asks the girl  that question  or vice versa, 
[04:30:30]  they give an answer.  They're never going  to see the person.  Well, what's the dumb  conversation?  It's always something  It's always,  all right,  what's your freebie  or your gimme?  My husband gave me one.  Well, mine is Brad Pitt.  I've got to tell you,  knowing that she's never  going to get near us.  But now, I mean.  I always like to pick  somebody reasonably attentive.  Somebody kindly.  That's the bit.  Well, I'm picking  the secretary  I work with.  You know who's on my list?  Yeah.  The new intern.  Right.  Yeah, you can have  Brad Pitt all you want. 
[04:31:00]  My one and only  is the intern  that started working.  I picked the  Channel 11 traffic girl.  I made it easy.  Crazy, yo.  Wait, that's not  the real time, is it?  Yeah, I know.  Oh, boy.  You got to go?  Well, I'm supposed to  go meet somebody  for another interview.  For a drink.  Yeah, drink it.  Where are you going now?  Actually, it's only  a couple blocks away,  but I've got to get  to AP.  To an AP interview.  I almost said  associate at press  to explain what AP is.  I suck. 
[04:31:30]  By the way, Sam,  your girlfriend  wants to sleep with Seth.  Yeah.  It's the haps.  Yeah.  Yeah, and he's in the room.  It's usually okay.  Listen, if you guys  are free after 11  and you still got that camera.  Uh-huh.  Oh!  Just a cuckold  with a camera.  No, no,  we'll set it up  on a tripod, Sam.  We're getting the action.  I guess the haps  would be, in hindsight,  maybe this should have  been one of those  interviews that I told  Jess about, like, 
[04:32:00]  this afternoon.  Right.  And she'd have gone,  oh, you should have told me.  I'll take you to the website  to watch the video.  Jim, I don't think  we have time to play the game.  No, I know.  Why do you think  I kept talking?  You're very lucky.  Will you guys burn  it to MP3 for me?  I'll put it in my apartment.  Yes, please.  Here it is.  You might want it  for your show.  Yeah.  I'll put it on the program.  Don't put me in the cartoon  N-O-R-T.  All right,  Lucy McGillicuddy.  What the hell is...  I really do. 
[04:32:30]  All right,  we've got to thank  Seth Green.  It was kind of a character  I was killing.  It was.  It really was.  Hey, this is Seth Green.  If you can stop masturbating  and put down that bong  for just a second,  you'll realize that you're  listening to Opie and Anthony.  Enjoy.  It's Opie and Anthony's  worst of 2008 cringe moments.  What was the last movie  you saw?  See any good movies lately?  Lately,  I don't know.  What was the last movie  you saw?  Mother Jugs and Speed.  Say it again.  That's quite all right. 
[04:33:00]  Yeah,  what was the last movie  you saw, Tom?  I saw,  let's see,  let's see,  let's see.  Let me get this  in my head.  I'm taking up time,  I know that.  It's all right.  Um,  uh,  the movie,  oh,  wow,  ask me what movie  I like the most.  Uh,  Tippi,  what's the movie  you like the most?  Okay, 
[04:33:30]  I'll give you  the actress's,  the actress's name,  and it broke my heart.  Mm-hmm.  Okay.  Mm-hmm.  He's rubbing his chest.  Meryl Streep.  Meryl Streep.  What's she playing?  Uh,  a lot of movies,  Tom,  you gotta give us  a little more.  Uh,  Iron Weed.  Kramer.  Ha,  ha,  ha,  ha,  ha,  ha,  Meryl Streep.  Kramer vs. Kramer.  Oh,  no,  that was an old one.  All right,  what,  which one?  Uh,  uh,  it was the one  with the daughter, 
[04:34:00]  what was,  no,  the one where,  she was in the Nazi,  German camp,  the Nazis had her,  the Germans.  I'm German,  and I'm embarrassed  about how Germans  do this stuff,  and shame on me,  but I didn't do it.  You'd be embarrassed  about being German.  My,  yeah,  well,  my name is  Schultz.  Schultz?  No,  with Meryl Streep.  She was in the 
[04:34:30]  Nazi concentration camp,  and,  um,  it was,  um,  oh,  my God,  help me.  The Deer Hunter.  Oh,  that was another one.  What movie  is he talking about?  I'm gonna work on,  Meryl Streep,  come on,  you know,  she's.  Sophie's Choice.  Sophie's Choice.  No,  what the movie was about?  What was it about?  She had two children, 
[04:35:00]  two children,  and the Nazis  took her,  and they said,  you can't go  with both of them.  you know who she gave up?  Oh.  Her girl,  the daughter,  the kid,  the boy.  That was Sophie's Choice.  How do you have to be a mom  and have to do that?  Why do you all give up? 
[04:35:30]  And Nazi Germany,  that's how they were.  You only have one kid.  How emotional he's getting.  Terrible,  terrible,  uh,  thing.  What happened to the other kid?  I don't know.  But what I know is that  Sophie,  Meryl Streep,  gave up  her daughter  to save her son.  Was she,  uh,  Jewish?  Is that it? 
[04:36:00]  Uh,  so,  I,  I don't know  if she's Jewish or not.  She's German.  And,  and,  and,  and,  and,  no,  but that's what happened.  So you don't like the Nazis,  right?  Oh,  oh,  oh,  oh,  oh,  really?  I love the Nazis.  They're great.  He's killing you.  Yeah,  yeah,  yeah,  yeah.  Yeah,  I really like them guys.  Right.  I can't,  I can't wait  to hang out with them.  Well, Tom,  get the fuck out of here. 
[04:36:30]  Oh,  Jesus,  Tom.  Watch the,  uh,  watch the words.  Now,  Tom,  she had to give up  her,  her kid,  which is a big,  but didn't you,  in a way,  do the same thing?  Not for the Nazis,  but didn't you do the same thing  when you kind of came to New York  and you're drinking,  you kind of gave up your kid?  Tippy's choice.  Yeah,  Tippy's choice.  Tippy's choice.  You gave up your kid  because you didn't want him  to know that you were a little flaky,  right?  Yeah.  Tom,  you told us earlier.  You had to give up a kid.  Yeah.  Yeah,  but I made sure my kid  was with his mother. 
[04:37:00]  Don't you wonder  how he's doing in school  or what is,  like,  sports he plays?  He's my grandmother.  I did the best I could.  We were going through a divorce.  What do you do?  You go through a divorce?  You come talk to me  when you go through a divorce  and we'll discuss  what's going on.  But don't you call him?  What are you going to do?  Give him a call.  So I give a kid  to the mother  and I pay child support.  Oh,  you did?  Of course. 
[04:37:30]  What do you think?  I'm not.  I was just asking,  Tippy.  He just...  I was just asking,  you did?  I got money.  I don't need nobody's money.  You do?  Come out here  and just play.  I got my own.  You don't know  who I know.  Oh, really?  So you got your own  deal set up  where you make money  and stuff?  Yeah.  Okay.  Okay.  Do you ever hear  of a guy named  John Lehman?  Ooh,  the John Lehman? 
[04:38:00]  No.  I didn't know him.  Herbert Lehman?  Who's he?  I don't know.  You just mentioned  your names.  Herbert Lehman  is John's father.  Uh-huh.  I don't know  who these people are  and you can't really  implicate...  The fucking...  You don't know  Lehman Brothers?  Of course you don't  know Lehman Brothers.  But you don't have  to curse us out.  So you have some  investments, I guess.  You're that right I do.  Yeah. 
[04:38:30]  Child support.  They open the envelope  into a hubcap  and some grass.  Hey, Tom,  sing us out of here.  We gotta go.  That's it for us today.  Give us a little song  as we leave everybody today.  Maybe something  a little emotional.  We went a little emotional  there for a few minutes.  All right.  Give us something  a little emotional.  Let me hear a song.  No, just something  in your head.  Something emotional.  Come on.  Feel it.  Something slow  and nice  and tugs  at the heartstrings.  All right.  Take us out.  I'm working on it right now.  Take us out.  Tippi Tom's gonna sing us out 
[04:39:00]  with an emotional song.  Let's see.  Hold on, hold on.  Feel it, Tom.  Hold on.  There's so many of them.  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  Um, wishing you were here, my baby.  Wishing you were here by me.  Yes, I know.  Yes, I know.  Wishing you were here.  Don't you know I love you so?  Don't you know I care? 
[04:39:30]  Yes, I do.  Yes, I do.  Don't you know I care?  That's it.  All the lyrics is it.  That's it.  But I got all the wounds.  All right.  Thank you, Tom.  Thank you.  That was very touching.  That's a pretty song.  That was good.  Tippi Tom, everybody.  I know who sang. 
[04:40:00]  I want to get busy.  I want to get busy.  I want to get busy. 
[04:40:30]  Tom.  Tom.  What, sir?  All right, we want to show you a clip.  Jimmy suggested that we get you a couple clips that you might like today.  Can you see the big screen right there up top?  Yeah, I'm watching right now.  Sam, point to the screen. 
[04:41:00]  Okay, it's on all screens.  All right, look at the screen.  Tell us what's going on.  First of all, that chick I don't like.  But earlier you said you liked her.  Well, she's okay.  Oh, God, the studio's filling up.  Okay.  Hey, we got Nazis here.  Oh, what are you showing those Nazi shit?  They're fucking Germans.  Nazis.  No, that's, this is your favorite movie.  No, it's not. 
[04:41:30]  Sophie's Choice.  Look.  Well, no, Sophie's Choice is very different.  No, look, see, it's Meryl Streep.  It's the daughter.  You're right.  Here it is.  Here's your movie.  You're right.  Look at that fine gentleman.  All right, listen to the movie.  No, he's a man.  Tom, listen to the movie.  Here we go.  We'll play in the scene that made him cry earlier on the show, where Meryl Streep has 
[04:42:00]  to give up one of her kids in my own son.  Yeah.  We're watching the version dubbed in German.  This is not the English version. 
[04:42:30]  No, he's counting.  Come and see here.  That Nazi son of a bitch.  Look, I'm German.  And I don't like what they did.  What did they do, Tom?  Because no one speaks fucking German here.  They killed people.  Might as well stop it.  No one can understand it.  I speak Spanish and German.  Steve from Bayshore. 
[04:43:00]  I love Germany.  I love America.  Right.  This is the end of the movie.  Like, some of it's in English, some of it's in German, and this part happens to be in  German.  There's no subtitles on this particular clip.  Uh-huh.  I guess you're supposed to know what's going on, kind of a thing.  Danny's not happy now.  What?  The Germans were wrong.  The Germans were wrong.  But they did. 
[04:43:30]  What'd they do?  Tommy, this is your favorite movie.  Explain what's going on, because we don't know German.  Tell us what's going on.  The only good thing a German did is build a Volkswagen and a Mercedes-Benz.  That's all I ever did right.  And I'm German.  Right.  Well, this is...  My name is Schultz.  Hey, Tippi, this is the...  That's German.  This is the scene that got you sad.  Here it comes. 
[04:44:00]  The Nazis talking to Meryl Streep as she's holding her daughter.  What's going on?  Tell us.  She's protecting her child.  There we go.  There goes to her baby.  It's a tragic movie.  No.  It's moving my heart.  They stole her baby.  It's a tragic movie. 
[04:44:30]  The Germans were wrong. 
[04:45:00]  And I'm German.  And I'm wrong.  I didn't do that.  I would never do that.  That was your people, though.  Yeah.  You know...  Well, I was raised that way, but I'm not that way.  Tom, why are you so upset?  I don't get it.  Yeah, you got so upset watching that clip.  Why are you so upset?  There's tears in your eyes.  It's wrong.  Why'd they take the little baby? 
[04:45:30]  I...  They're wrong.  What was wrong about that?  I'm sure he was taking the kids to get some good health care or something.  In those times...  In those times...  Things were different, I guess.  You ain't gonna boo that shit now.  Why'd they take the baby, though?  The little baby got taken...  Oh, look.  She's...  Oh, no.  Look, here's the scene.  This is what bothers you? 
[04:46:00]  Yes!  It's Meryl Streep!  Stare her baby!  Stare her baby!  That's wrong!  No!  Hey!  I would...  I...  I...  I'd go fight!  Yeah?  Fight those Nazis?  I will!  That's a funny movie, right?  Did you laugh when you watched that movie? 
[04:46:30]  That's funny.  I like movies, yeah!  What a rebound.  Wow.  The Opie and Anthony Institute of Art and Literature is proud to present a collection of books on tape  soulfully voiced by the homeless, Tippi Tung.  I can't do as good as a guy to do it, but you know.  Masterpieces like Herman Melville's Moby Dick.  Call me this, Mom.  Some years ago... 
[04:47:00]  Never mind how long precisely.  And Dickens historically themed A Tale of Two Cities.  It was the best of times.  It was the worst of times.  It was the age of wisdom.  Good job.  Okay.  You won't believe your ears as Tom mutters and fumbles his way through Mark Twain's classic,  Huck Finn.  Huck Finn's wealth and the fact that he was under the window Douglas' protection. 
[04:47:30]  Okay, I guess I'm getting rid of him.  And then be prepared to have your breath taken away, literally, with his read of Great Expectations.  Heaven knows we'd never be ashamed of our tears, okay?  Of course not.  Anyway, I think I got silver. 
[04:48:00]  And finally, you'll enjoy the classic for all ages, Dr. Seuss's Green Eggs and Ham.  Great eggs and ham.  No, green eggs and ham.  Yeah, great, yeah.  See where my glasses is.  I am Sam.  I am Sam.  Sam, I am.  Come on, man.  Who even knew Tippi Tom had glasses?  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  It's a collection of some of the finest literature ever written and then read by a homeless drunk. 
[04:48:30]  Order Tippi Tom Books on Tape today.  It's Opie and Anthony's Cringe Moments.  You'll laugh so hard you just might soil yourself.  It's Opie and Anthony's Cringe Moments.  Let's take a look back at Opie and Anthony's Cringe Moments.  A selection of segments that'll make you stare at the radio and say,  What the F was that? 
[04:49:00]  Holy crap, I'm done.  Yes, you just heard what you thought you heard.  It's Opie and Anthony's Cringe Moments.  You've got to supervise.  You see, he's got the tongue scraper.  That's going to get the goop off his tongue.  But then you've got to make sure the sample goes into that plastic spoon.  All right?  And Steve, it's a good thing that you're there because you'll be the first one,  as punishment for not having the scraper,  I feel that you should be the first one to take a little whiff.  And then you've got to heat up the spoon and inject it. 
[04:49:30]  It's got a scraper.  No, I know that, but it wasn't to your liking.  Big A, when you do it, make sure you stick your tongue right out  because the stuff at the back is the more heinous.  You've got to stick your tongue out.  Iraq, get in there, Iraq.  Make sure he does it right.  This is how it's done.  And tell him to open his mouth.  Stick your tongue way out.  Go like, ah.  With the scraper.  He knows, he's got it.  Yeah, Iraq, you collect the sample.  Way in the back.  Oh, my God.  Now scrape.  Iraq, don't move away.  Don't, don't lose it. 
[04:50:00]  He rocks down.  Come on, it's just a bit of tongue, Gunk.  We all get that.  No, don't be an adult about it.  He rocks down on the floor.  No!  Ow!  Oh, Biles coming out of Iraq now.  Oh, he's wiping his face on a T-shirt.  Okay, do it again.  All right, no, no, not do it again, Iraq. 
[04:50:30]  Do you got a sample on the spoon?  Iraq's got to supervise.  Wait, Steve, what do we got on the spoon so far?  Tapioca pudding.  Steve.  Get a little more.  How about a quick, just a quick sniff?  Steve, a quick sniff.  Looks like Farida.  I'm Mike, of course.  I'm Mike.  Ah!  Wait, that reaction took forever.  You dropped the sample.  Don't drop the sample.  No, I didn't drop it.  I didn't drop it.  I didn't drop it.  It's just, it's concentrated.  Oh, Iraq.  Oh, Iraq.  I got just cute. 
[04:51:00]  He's so cute.  Oh, this is...  Big A, don't be upsteady.  Do this for anyone.  Big A, we're going to get your teeth clean.  Anybody's tongue stuff would make you...  Anybody's tongue stuff would do this.  Big A, in all fairness, I scrape my tongue every morning,  and it's horrific, and I really do try to keep my mouth clean.  I'll get that stuff as well.  I'll get it right now.  Yeah, absolutely.  All right.  Iraq, get back in there.  No, we need more of a sample. 
[04:51:30]  Iraq, get in there.  Another scraping.  Iraq, get in there.  Hold on.  No, no.  I say one more person takes it off that.  Off that.  Off that person.  Yeah, Stan has got me next.  All right, Stan.  Oh, God.  Stan doesn't care.  He's a fuck.  Oh.  I'm just...  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  That's okay.  He only went to C.  Good.  Okay, here we go.  Oh, God.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Oh, look at it.  Oh, my God.  It's like sherbert.  It's a spoonful of sherbert?  What color is it?  It's a nice whitish gray with a little yellow.  It's lumpy, too, right? 
[04:52:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, but that's...  I laugh so hard, my gut hurts.  Go ahead.  Ha, ha, ha.  That's a good car.  You know what?  I'm going in for one.  I have to.  No.  Jimmy, are you going to go in for one?  Come on.  Someone else has to go...  All right, E-Rock, get another sample.  Hold on.  We got to get that.  We'll have one more on this one.  Can we get one more on this one?  Let's get more.  Okay.  Just get more.  Get some fresh stuff.  E-Rock, get in there.  All right.  E-Rock, get in. 
[04:52:30]  Good big scrape on the other side.  Actually, from here, his tongue doesn't look that bad.  Oh, that's not right.  Ah!  What?  Ah!  You're trying to collect this.  E-Rock's crying.  E-Rock is crying.  Look at his eyes.  They're trying to collect the sample.  Oh, you serious?  It's looking like they're...  It's bleeding, too?  Oh, he's got...  There's blood in it?  Oh, God!  It looks like blood porridge.  Oh! 
[04:53:00]  Oh, it's like...  It's like blood pudding.  Don't lose the sample.  Let me hold the camera for a second.  Get that away from me.  Sam, you got to go in for a sniff.  Sam?  Sam's next.  Get away from me!  Get a mic on, Sam!  Get him by the mic.  I've got this...  I see it.  Oh, God!  Sam's...  Sam's throwing up.  Put it down there. 
[04:53:30]  Put it down there again.  Put it down there while he's playing.  Put it down.  Keep it down.  Keep it down.  Don't lose the sample!  Don't lose it.  Don't lose it.  Put it...  Wow!  Oh, this is so disgusting!  And when you look down in the garbage can, as you're puking, there's bile already in  the garbage can.  Oh, I can't take this.  I can't take this.  Oh, boy!  It's disgusting.  E-Rock, do you have some on your spoon?  I feel...  No, not really.  All right, let's get a...  Let's get another... 
[04:54:00]  One more scrape from the other side, I guess, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, try the side.  The other side.  Yeah, okay.  All right.  I'm a big A, you're a trooper today, bro.  Big A rules.  Free appetizer at FH Island.  Get a big, good one.  Good one.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  He just...  What are you on there?  He just scraped out an oyster.  Oh, God damn it.  You guys are unbelievable.  E-Rock, get in there for a sniff of that sample. 
[04:54:30]  Yeah, E-Rock, please.  E-Rock, let me...  E-Rock, let me...  E-Rock, one more sniff.  E-Rock.  E-Rock, come on.  I want a sniff.  I want a sniff.  I like him.  Look out there, man.  Damn, look out.  The pal talk camera.  There you go.  Look at E-Rock.  He jumped back 10 feet and fell on the couch.  E-Rock, will you get in there for a smell?  Come on.  We're telling everyone you're our go-to.  One more sniff.  One more sniff, E-Rock. 
[04:55:00]  E-Rock.  Take a good look.  Take a good look at that lumpy stuff.  E-Rock.  That lumpy tongue scraping.  Such a professional still holding the marker.  We just found another bit for our...  We just found another bit for our pay-per-view, Ant.  Where's our...  Oh, yeah.  Big A, you're going to be part of our pay-per-view with this.  We might not be able to clean your teeth for another month.  By the way, don't forget, we have two more naughty boys. 
[04:55:30]  Okay.  Don't forget Danny and Travis.  Who are those naughty boys?  Kenny, you want in?  What's this?  Kenny!  Come on, Kenny!  If Kenny does it, I'll do it.  Where's Roland?  Bring Roland in.  I can't do it.  Let's get one more scrape done.  Yeah, I don't think it will...  Jim Jeffries, would you go in for one?  I'll go in for one.  I've got a pretty good constitution for stinky breath.  Just, you've been naughty in general.  It's a general naughtiness.  Wait, could...  Should we get another scrape off his tongue?  How much is in the spoon there, Steve? 
[04:56:00]  Oh, there's a lot.  It's plenty.  It looks like boogers in pudding.  Oh.  All right.  I'd rather smell it than a banana.  Go ahead.  Go ahead, Danny.  All right, right, right, right.  Danny's got to brace himself.  You don't have to shove it in my face.  Yeah, this is something you've got to...  Don't touch the spoon, because we don't want to lose the sample.  All right.  Oh, he's gagging.  Oh, he's gagging.  He's gagging. 
[04:56:30]  Danny had more of a cat gag.  Yeah.  Yeah, it was like a hairball.  Right.  Oh, man, that's...  I know what that is, though.  It almost smells like when you're really, really sick.  Like, you know that sick taste that you get in your mouth?  Like, if you've ever had bronchitis or whatever.  Oh, he's got sick.  That just doesn't go away.  It smells like sick.  Yeah, it's sick.  It's like a sick smell.  Oh, holy crap.  What's wrong?  Uh, good boy, Danny.  Travis?  Oh.  Feel free. 
[04:57:00]  Okay.  I got your breathing through your mouth.  Mouth closed, Travis.  Don't try to sneak it.  Yeah.  Right in the nose.  Just smash it into his face.  Not one person can stay up.  Travis?  All right, all right.  That's it?  No.  Oh, no, yeah, that's it.  I don't need seconds.  All right.  Oh, look at Tim come in.  Hey, Tim.  All right.  Yeah.  That smells bad. 
[04:57:30]  I don't like this spoon.  You think he's going to smell the spoon?  Everyone has the same reaction.  So where's Roland?  Yeah, Roland.  Come on.  E-Rock.  Have we got any girls in the building this morning?  Unfortunately, no.  At this stage in our careers, we don't know girls anymore.  Big A, unfortunately.  Big A, can we get another, like, sample off the tongue?  E-Rock, can you get one more sample off the tongue?  One more, E-Rock.  Please, do some work.  Get a good one, Big A, please.  There's no bad ones. 
[04:58:00]  They're all good ones.  Get a good one.  Get a good one.  Don't throw off the tongue.  It's on his shirt.  Here.  Oh, it's on his shirt.  Spap it off his shirt.  Look at these guys.  It's like they're handling, like, a sample of HIV.  They don't want to get close to it.  They're, what?  Oh, it's all lumpy.  I just saw it.  I got a good look at it.  It looks like Metallica's load cover.  All right.  Get rolling. 
[04:58:30]  Get in turn, Ron.  Get in turn, Ron.  Come here, stupid.  Come on, young Ron.  You can do it.  Be a big boy.  All right.  Young Ron.  All right.  Does a great job for us.  This is where you get...  Give me that.  Put it on your tongue.  Put it on your tongue.  Keep going.  Keep going.  We got to make him vomit.  Go.  Go.  Hey.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh. 
[04:59:00]  Ron, what does that smell like?  Awful.  I can't put it to words.  I don't know.  Oh, my God.  Where's rolling?  And stop sniffing in.  Steve is wonderful.  Steve with that spoon.  He's a real gladiator.  Everyone's, like, tearing from the eyes and red. 
[04:59:30]  I wish Dave was here.  He won't come in.  Come on, Roland.  You have to make up for your naughtiness.  Roland, come on.  I would love to see Bob Kelly in this situation because he would just be...  Oh, dude.  Dude, that was so bad.  Oh, that was so...  Roland, come on, Roland.  Just take one for the team.  Come on, Roland.  Come on, Roland.  Roland.  One whiff.  I don't care.  We're leaving for the weekend after.  Now, make sure you smell it.  Don't fake it. 
[05:00:00]  We can tell.  Then you just got to do it again.  Roland, how are you today?  Smash the spoon in.  You'll be fine.  Go ahead, Roland.  Just close your mouth.  Roland.  No, smell it.  Roland.  You're going to smell it, Roland.  We'll hold you down if you don't.  You see his arms?  He just went so gay.  He just looked like a baby.  He put his arms up in the air, like...  He was like, oh, I'm going to get you.  He shook his arms back and forth. 
[05:00:30]  He did.  He went like...  Oh, my God.  Oh, did you see it, Jimmy?  Yeah, he basically...  You got a good look.  Dan said that Roland had a slight seizure right now.  He just had a slight seizure.  Oh, my God.  I am so nauseated.  Jim, you're up.  Bring over the spoon.  Bring the spoon.  No, no, no, no.  Have him go over to it.  Bring the spoon.  I want that nowhere near me.  All right.  Jim Jeffries, who's playing Carolines, tonight, tomorrow, and Sunday.  A very, very funny call.  212-757-4100. 
[05:01:00]  I do believe he's going to do quite well at Carolines this weekend.  No, no, it's not...  No, it's not...  Yeah.  Bro!  No, I know what it does.  Oh, Jesus.  You get a bit of a burn at the end.  It's like wasabi.  It's when it goes up the end towards the hairs and all that. 
[05:01:30]  It's powerful wasabi.  Go on, Norton.  Have a go.  No, can't do it.  I've done some disgusting things.  I can't do it.  Opie, what do you think?  Do me a favor.  You're going to go in?  All right.  Get another good scraping.  Get one more good scraping.  I don't know.  Get a good, hard, deep scrape.  Right way back.  Almost choke yourself.  There you go.  Ant, are you going to do it?  Ant?  Are you insane?  Are you a mad person?  That would be the great get.  Look at it sliming off on this moon. 
[05:02:00]  I actually thought it was going to be worse.  Although I do feel kind of ill now.  Yeah.  It's looking like cake batter.  All right, E-Rock, bring it over.  I'll give it a shot.  What the hell?  I've had a worse tongue than that.  I'm not close to Anthony.  Get away from me.  I swear I'll kill.  I will kill.  I'm not doing the mustache thing, though.  No way.  A quick one.  Just a quick one.  I think smelling it.  Wait, wait.  Don't do that.  Can you get disease of smelling it or not?  I don't think so.  Put it down there.  I just want to look.  Oh, wait. 
[05:02:30]  You're not okay.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Hey, Opie.  Tongue-scraping mustache.  Come on.  No way.  I don't know if I can do this.  I did it.  Go on, do it.  Take a good, deep breath through your nose.  It's not that bad.  It's quite a nice.  Jimmy, if I do it, you do it.  Can't do it.  Come on.  I've done a lot.  How about we do a tag team?  I can't do that.  You can't do it.  Well, Kenny.  Kenny.  Me and Kenny.  I'll throw up horribly.  I already feel nauseous. 
[05:03:00]  Oh, my God.  I can smell from here.  Get a good one.  The only reason I'm doing this is that because you sold 160 tickets in the last half hour.  Wow.  What are we up to?  Yeah.  Another 160 plus.  So what are we up to?  I don't know.  A sellout is $1,800 for the R&A Animation Festival.  People are slowing down.  Don't disappoint your radio heroes.  Tickets are on sale.  June 5th, Rosalind Ball, R&A Animation Festival.  Yeah.  All right.  Now, let me smell this.  Hamilton, Brandt, Kornfeld. 
[05:03:30]  Get a good one.  Kenny, we're going to do a tag team here.  Ready?  Oh, get it over there.  You've got to get right into it.  The first one didn't really hurt me.  Want me to go first?  Yeah, you go first.  Yeah, big Kenny.  Nothing phases him.  No, Kenny is really unfair.  Oh, he's on the floor.  Oh, my God.  He's facing Mecca.  He fell on the floor.  Oh, my God. 
[05:04:00]  Oh, come on.  It wasn't that bad.  Have another go.  It might be better now.  Look at my eyes.  It's not that bad.  His eyes are tearing.  He's crying.  Holy, Jimmy, please do this.  He's crying.  Look at Jimmy.  Oh, my God.  He's backed against the wall.  One of the better reactions.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony's 2008 cringiest moments, and it's come to an end.
