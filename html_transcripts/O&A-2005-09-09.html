<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a birthday call from a listener in Arizona, sparking a discussion about regional racist slurs. This segued into birthday song parodies, one for the caller and another mocking Steve's hybrid car. Steve, a co-worker, then joined in studio to complain about his car's dead battery (caused by leaving the dome light on), leading to homophobic jokes about Steve and his vehicle.  Further calls featured more regionally specific slurs and darkly humorous anecdotes about the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, including a story about a retirement home where 30 elderly residents perished after being abandoned by staff.  A news story about a Price is Right rerun offering a trip to New Orleans as a prize was deemed inappropriate, adding to the discussion.  Technical difficulties interrupted the show, prompting a series of knock-knock jokes and listener complaints.

Ron and Fez, hosts of an upcoming show, joined Opie and Anthony in studio.  They discussed their new program and complaints about their treatment on Opie and Anthony's message board. The hosts then focused on their staff, particularly a new employee, Harry, and his eccentric behavior, interspersed with more jokes and a song parody dedicated to Ron and Fez's executive producer, Earl (who was also in studio). This segment concluded with plans for an "attack" on the Lex and Terry message board, a bounty offered for related calls, and another song parody.

A substantial portion of the show was devoted to a discussion about prescription drug use, with callers and hosts sharing graphic details about their experiences with Vicodin, Valium, and Zoloft, including vivid descriptions of cravings and intense effects.  One caller recounted an anecdote about Mike Tyson's Zoloft use.  A significant segment focused on the Opie and Anthony auction for Hurricane Katrina victims, featuring numerous items including autographed promotional materials (a "Steve's American Flame" shirt and a Scarface shirt), a Mardi Gras banner, and a large donation of gold and platinum records from Lee Abrams, a caller described as a "mad scientist of radio".  The discussion included conversations about payola and radio industry practices.  Big Kev contributed items to the auction, including a Stone Pony poster and a point list from the “Sex for Sam 3” contest.  Stalker Patty donated a wig, and Francine, in a provocative outfit, provided news updates. A caller shared a story about Howard Stern’s claims of inventing various things, including breathing. Another caller's story involved a misidentification and a comedian later revealed to be a serial rapist. Ozzy Osbourne's potentially lip-synced performance and further auction updates were also discussed, along with promotion of a Ron and Fez event at B.B. King's.

The show continued with crude jokes about rape and references to *All in the Family*, followed by discussions of ashy knees, shaving problems for black men, and a bizarre childhood anecdote.  Francine delivered news updates, including graphic descriptions of post-Hurricane Katrina conditions in New Orleans, the murder of Rabbit Kissel, and an MTA train derailment. Opie and Anthony interjected with highly offensive commentary targeting Francine, including racist and sexist remarks.  A lengthy and offensive rant from Francine concerned animal rights activists protesting Life Science Research Incorporated, filled with misogynistic and ableist slurs. Further news items included Martha Stewart's television return and the Simpson sisters.  Ron and Fez were in studio, and a significant portion was dedicated to playing audio of Fez's emotional and inebriated on-air breakdown following his grandmother's death, intercut with Opie and Anthony's commentary.  This segment detailed Fez's distress, his alcohol consumption, and his conflict with Mikey D. The show concluded with promotion of the Ron and Fez welcome back party and a "Bombs and Flubs" segment.


The "Bombs and Flubs, Volume 3" segment showcased on-air mistakes by the hosts and Jimmy Norton, focusing on mispronunciations, forgotten names, and awkward transitions.  Anthony's flubs often involved self-deprecating anecdotes.  A news story about a Brooklyn man whose estranged wife used his frozen sperm was discussed, leading to more comedic mishaps.  A planned movie with a plot involving forced abortion and crime was also mentioned. The Hurricane Katrina eBay auction was again discussed. A caller suggested auctioning off a day in the studio, which was already being offered as "intern for a day".  Pat brought in his Nathan's hot dog eating contest memorabilia for the auction.  Audio clips of police taser incidents were played, provoking commentary and jokes.  Michael Rapaport was interviewed, recounting a bizarre incident involving police harassment. He promoted his show, "The War at Home," mentioning its uncensored nature and storylines.  The interview touched on his past experiences, including a past incident with Natasha Lyonne where he damaged her apartment.  He expressed regret and concern for Lyonne’s health and spoke about their collaboration with Donald Logue. The interview concluded with thanks to Ron and Fez for their two-day appearance and promotion of their show.

Could be a fun little thing that we could do today.  Yeah, we heard about new fees, you know?  That's kind of localized.  Yeah.  What's the local term for something around Arizona? 
[00:09:30]  That's great.  A wagon burner.  That's, that's, uh, that could start something today.  We'll see.  We'll use that at Mohegan Sun or Foxwoods.  Yeah.  Play some cards up there.

[00:12:00]  Good luck to ya  Got a lot of guys sending song parodies done to rap music  What happened to us?  I know  We used to be known as like rockers, rock DJs and all that  But all the parodies that come in are all to a hip-hop beat  That's all the, yeah, the rap now  All the kids like us  Should we play the other one real fast?  Like chemistry?  First, we were talking about localized racism  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah  We don't need to know what you call people in Washington, D.C. 
[00:12:30]  We've got that already  We're talking about localized  We're talking about ones we never heard of before, you asses  They hear that one every day  They hear that one every day out of everyone's mouth here  Right  I don't say it  Of course you don't  You don't even know what I'm talking about, do you?  What's it start with?  Um, let's see  L  LARPers?  L  Yes  Am I lost?  Ligger  Oh, wait a minute 
[00:13:00]  Oh, geez  That's a lot  Oh, all right, wow  Yeah, we don't need the obvious ones  Of course not  All right, we have another song parody that came in overnight  In honor of Steve and his hybrid car  Ooh  Well, Steve should come in and talk about something  Yeah, let's get Martini Steve in the studio here  Little problem, I think  Here comes Steve  What we had  Where is he? 
[00:13:30]  Uh-oh  Uh-oh  Uh-oh  Uh-oh  Uh-oh  Uh-oh  Uh-oh  Oh  Steve, what's the problem?  Well, you know, hybrids are very efficient  But the one way they do perform just like regular cars  Is when you leave the dome light on all night  It does kill the regular battery  The dome light on for what?  Three seconds?  Wait  I, uh  That's all it took?  What, leaving  To shut down your hybrid?  Leaving the interior lights on all night  Yeah, killed the, uh 
[00:14:00]  Killed  It didn't shut off the hybrid engine  So once I got it jumped  It worked just fine  But the, uh  The regular electronics  Like all like the windows and stuff like that  Operate off the same, uh  Battery that a regular car would operate off of  And your starter?  Yeah, everything  So like when  So leaving all the lights on  Would kill the battery  Just like it would in any other car  But, but  Why, why would it kill  Did, did it kill the electric motor  That drives your car?  No, not at all  So theoretically  You could have backed out  Under electric power?  Once I got it jumped  The thing worked fine 
[00:14:30]  I'm not talking about  To get it jumped  That's right  I mean  Could you have backed it out  Under your  Electric motor power?  Well no  Because I couldn't start it  But isn't it just a switch?  Because it's  The electric switch  That powers  The switch that turns on  The car  The actual switch  That turns on that  300 volt electric motor  Yeah  Is powered by  A normal regular  Diehard  Oh, so even though  There's enough power  To run the electric motor 
[00:15:00]  Yeah  You can't start it  Right  To run it on the electric motor  That I learned last night  Yeah, or  Yesterday morning  Yeah, exactly  Because you should be able to  Run it on just the electric motor  That's exactly what I thought  And once  Once you actually get the thing  Once you actually power up  The starter  And get it going  Yeah, everything's fine  You know  And it starts pumping  Pumping the power back  Into the regular auxiliary battery  Shouldn't there be a backup  That perhaps  The batteries that power  Your electric motor  That were fine  You say  Can then be used  To maybe jump start  Your car 
[00:15:30]  I think there actually is  But I wasn't  I'm not  You know  Well versed  Is there  Try it again  The old faggot mobile  Is not starting  Not a faggot mobile  I am paying a lot less  For gasoline  You gotta jump on a cock  And ride that to work  Did you jerk off  In the gas tank  With that said  There's a good segue  Into chemistry's song  About Steve's hybrid car  Oh, lovely song  Good old chemistry  Yeah, I'm sure  You're pissed off  By this one, no? 
[00:16:00]  He's good  So I can't really  Get pissed off at him  But, you know  It doesn't really  He's pretty much  Calling you a faggot  Yes, he is  In this song  We're pretty much  Laughing and agreeing  Here's chemistry's hybrid song  For Steve  Hybrid song  I know a big bear  He talks with good diction  Hibernates in Toyota  With good fuel emissions  And great tax deductions  His habitat's a hybrid  His paws are on the steering wheel  He barely fits inside it 
[00:16:30]  His cave has XM  And a keyless entry  Don't leave a scent in your tent  His belly is empty  The only bear  I know a gastric bypass  Smarter than the average  Roll up in the hybrid  And steal your picnic basket  The ranger's lunch  Always makes his belly groan  The last I seen him  He was speeding around  Jellystone  Getting 40 miles per gallon  Rolling through the Rockies  Doing Ramone promos  For two-disc jockeys  Steve's a piece of garbage  Forged for nuts and berries  Top of the food chain  But drives a car  For fairies  Piece of shit  Stores energy  With friction  And magnets 
[00:17:00]  Ramones  Hybrids are for faggots  Hybrids are gay  Steve's the queer  Plug in your automobile  You take it in the rear  You homo  Yo, his car got a kickstand  Go and buy a new one  Spend more than six grand  Hybrids are gay  Steve's the queer  If you plug in your automobile  You take it in the rear  You homo  His car got a kickstand  Go and buy a new one  Spend more than six grand  Hybrids sucked in  Hybrids are gay 
[00:17:30]  Come on, Steve  Come on, yeah  Piece of crap  I'm going to go work on my new song  Chemistry got killed with a claw hammer  So how did you get into work?  They gave me a rental  Until they can  Ooh  Yeah  I mean, it's not  It's under full warranty  And they go, yeah, okay  We're just going to replace the battery  They gave you a rental  Was it a hybrid rental?  No, it's not  Because they can't 
[00:18:00]  Keep those in the showroom  Long enough to  Oh, they're flying off the shelves  They certainly are  You know what?  Call me a homo if you want  But, you know  All right  Homo  Fag  But there's a year-long  Waiting list for these cars  So, you know  You know what else is a waiting list for?  AZT  When they only make a  Well, when they only make a hundred a year  Yeah, they don't  Exactly  That's why there's a waiting list, you idiot  How many are on the assembly line?  Plenty of them  Oh, stop it 
[00:18:30]  Did you  Wait, when we were in Los Angeles  Didn't you see all the hybrid cars that were out there?  No  No, I did  I was too busy whizzing past them  In some scooped up rocket car that I rented  What happened to your car?  Did the power surge protector fail?  Plug-in vehicle makes me sick  It's not a plug-in vehicle  It certainly is  Hybrid taxis are coming to New York  Exactly  Big story in the paper today  Apparently there's a surplus of faggot cab drivers  Yep  Yeah, these taxi cab drivers have the option to convert from gas-guzzling Ford Crown Victorias 
[00:19:00]  To any of six car models that run on both gas and electricity  Great  That's my friend  Hybrid cabs coming to New York, it looks like  Great  Steve was driving to work and almost got rear-ended because he pushed in the cigarette lighter  by accident and his speed went down like 20 miles per hour  Doesn't do that  No  It doesn't  I kind of like that it went in  Yeah  I like that  I kind of like that  It's good format but my presentation really stunk 
[00:19:30]  You knew that one was finished  Yeah  Because when you said he pushed his cigarette lighter in and then you kept on trucking  Yeah  And then it tends to slow the car down 20 miles  And I had to pick a speed  Yeah, it really stunk  My presentation blew  It was just a little mixed up  Good idea because I can picture Steve driving and then the cigarette lighter and then he slows  Down because of the battery  You know  Just the idea of Steve being rear-ended is funny in itself  That's true  I'm so mean  No, I love you, Steve  Why don't you take it off there, Steve 
[00:20:00]  All right  Oh, he caught, Steve  Come on, there you go  I pushed that piece of shit out of here  All right, let's go to Bob in Kentucky  This could be pretty interesting  Bob, go ahead  Good morning, guys  Good morning, Jeff  Hi, Bob  The racist term that was really regional to Detroit  Where I'm from was Shpota  For the African-American community  Because they weren't Shpota B North of 8 Mile  Because what?

American Indian  Wow  My favorite one was for like Indians from India  My friend Dean came up with it  He called them cinnamon lips  And that was my favorite because he said  This is what Dean said  That their mouths  Like the coloring of an asshole  So it looked like cinnamon  Old cinnamon lips  Jesus  That's pretty good 
[00:22:00]  Oh, that made me laugh my whole childhood  That's a nasty one  All right, so what's the latest in New Orleans?  Let's see  They're pumping the floodwaters out  Some of the pumps are getting fouled by dead bodies  And debris  Like cars and such  Yeah  They got to stop the pumps every once in a while  To clear out the dead bodies  Clear it out  You know  I guess they've ordered 25,000 body bags  Yeah  Yeah  For the entire area down there  Like for the entire Gulf Coast 
[00:22:30]  That was affected  I don't know if they'll go through that many  You think?  I don't know  They're kind of pulling out pockets of, you know, 30 at a clip  So, uh  It could add up  Definitely could  That  The worst story so far is the retirement home  Did you read about that one?  Oh, God  What happened?  They found 30 bodies of old people in their retirement home  Because the staff just left  What?  Just left when the water started rising  I guess some feeble attempts were made to batten down the hatches 
[00:23:00]  They found some tables pushed against some windows and doors  And kind of held in place with wheelchairs that were, the wheels were locked  And electric wheelchairs  Kind of holding these boards in place  Thinking that's going to keep the wind and water out  But, uh  Apparently it didn't  The staff  I guess tried to  To call some emergency service people  But they were just  You know, no communication  They couldn't get there  So, uh  Finally they just said  Fuck it  And left  They left 30 elderly 
[00:23:30]  Uh  To their own devices  Uh  All of them died  All of them  Some found wrapped in shower curtains  Laying on the floor  I guess they thought that would protect them  Others just  Kind of  Laying across their wheelchairs  And, uh  In gurneys  In beds  And, uh  They just cleared those people out of their, um  Their  Retirement home  Holy crap  You make it all those years  You live through so many things  And you go out 
[00:24:00]  Because, uh  Somebody that's supposed to be taking care of you  Hightails it out of there  And you know you see the water rising  That's a slow death, man  The water doesn't just pour in  That rises  Yeah  Oh, that's gonna suck  Uh-oh  It's up to my knees  You know  It's not the quick, uh  Quick death there  You're sitting in your wheelchair  Just  It's cold  Oh, that's horrible  Yeah, trying to find dry places  In the  Oh, that's  Yeah, and there's probably, uh  Stairs  But they couldn't get upstairs  Um  Probably something where they could have gone  Up to higher floors 
[00:24:30]  But, uh  No  Um  Another story  Really quick  And this is not a joke  CBS fucked up royally the other day  Price is Right prize makes some uneasy  Listen to this  By an unfortunate turn of events  The Price is Right aired a rerun from December  In which the prizes  The two top winners bid on their showcases  Were a trip to New Orleans  And a speedboat  Ooh  And a speedboat  Someone didn't do their job  And look at what was going on with the reruns 
[00:25:00]  So it's a pretty big story today  CBS issued a written apology yesterday afternoon  Saying the show was scheduled before Hurricane Katrina  And that its, uh  Inventory logs for the show  Do not list all prizes or products offered  They were offering a trip to New Orleans  And a speedboat  Wow  This aired on, uh  And a boat  New Orleans is a wonderful city  That is frequently offered  As a destination travel prize  On the Price is Right  The network said in a statement  Out of consideration for the victims of Hurricane Katrina  We made every effort to pull all the episodes 
[00:25:30]  From circulation that featured a trip to New Orleans  As a prize  However, this one was unfortunately overlooked  And broadcast today  To viewers who received the East Coast feed of the show  The mistake was corrected in time  For airing on the West Coast  So  But why would they yank  I could see that one  That's kind of an unusual pairing  Why would they yank all New Orleans trips?  I mean, it was just the reality  That they gave away trips to New Orleans  Yeah  That doesn't seem inappropriate  Speedboat I could kind of see  Like, alright  It's  Oh  We're sorry  Yeah, there's a big sorry there  Sorry 
[00:26:00]  From CBS today  A lot of people are, um  Chiming in on instant feedback  Saying they don't have a signal  Say, XM is not working  Happened  Please go to commercial  Nobody has a signal  Hmm  Uh, someone on the phone  Said that the repeaters are down  In New York or something  Some kind of technical problem  A glitch?  I don't know  Are your satellites down?  I can only hear you online  Really?  All channels  All channels say no signal  Hmm  They must not be getting a signal  That's odd 
[00:26:30]  I think it has something to do with the repeaters  Is it the sunspots?  We having a problem with the sunspots?  Alright, why don't we take a quick break  And we'll figure it all out  How's that sound?  Send Steve out there to fix them  Get out there and fix those repeaters immediately  Alright  Let's see if we can get an answer to  To the, uh  Yes, where's Elo?  Location check  I don't know  Stay there  Like sand through the hourglass  So is the only name virus  I don't know the background of this  But, uh, I guess a retarded kid  Had a knock-knock joke  What could it possibly be?

[00:30:30]  Can we have our guys on the board, please?  Right  I know they want to train people for Ron and Fez  Who are starting up on Monday, but  Not at our expense  I say, let Ron and Fez  Have to deal with loud music in their headphones  For the first few months like we did  Exactly  It's half the fun of getting your show off the ground  Is yelling at your staff  And they'll make something out of it  That was just blasting  Wow, was that loud  I haven't turned to my left in months 
[00:31:00]  To look at these guys  Because they're doing something wrong  All of a sudden I feel my neck going to the left again  Like it's the first week  Derek's got it all figured out  He knows the volumes, everything  It's second nature to him  Are the satellites working now?  You know something? I don't know  I got instant feedback here  From different parts of the country  Saying they can't hear it  And it's fine  I hear it no problem  And it can't be the repeatest 
[00:31:30]  Because I can't hear you in Philly  And I hear you fine in Pennsylvania  And I hear you fine in Connecticut  And I can't hear anything  So who knows?  Don walked in and said that everything's working again  So they had to reboot the system  Because one of the satellites  Something happened  What the hell is that about?  Rebooting a satellite  I just don't like that  Does a satellite, what?  Going about a thousand miles an hour?  Probably a little quicker than that  Alright, and we're depending our careers on that?  Actually, relative to the planet 
[00:32:00]  It's doing zero  Right  It's just in a stationary orbit  Above the country  Is it really?  Yeah  Oh, God  I think it's going to be one of those days  By the way, Ron and Fez  Will be joining the program very shortly  Yes  They start up on 202  This fine channel  Monday, right after this show  I was trolling the message boards 
[00:32:30]  And of course  I went over to ronandfez.net  I guess that's their message board  And people bashing our show, Opie  And bashing the fact that  We didn't get Ron and Fez in here quickly enough  We do everything a little louder on our show  Yeah  Oh, my God  Apparently so  Music, everything's just a little louder  Thanks for having us in, though  This is great  I came back from break 
[00:33:00]  I couldn't hear myself think  Speak up, I can't really hear you  We do stuff just a little bit louder  It's great, though  I already have lost at least 20% of my hearing  And thanks to Harry, one of your new guys  I think I just lost another percent  Hey, by the way, the people that bash you guys  It's because we still have D.C. people on that board  That are mad at us completely  Right, right  So, like, when we went to Washington  Anybody that went on got bashed on that station  Yeah 
[00:33:30]  So we're just limbo boys  We're limbo boys  It is a tough thing to have to get through  That whole phase  Right  You know, of limbo  But they were upset  I guess the first time you guys came in  When Fez came running in  Saying I got a golden ticket  Yeah  And we waited till the shuttle landed, I guess  Right  We were watching the shuttle land  And people on the message board that I was reading  Could not understand why we made Ron and Fez wait  While they just rebroadcast or broadcast the shuttle landing 
[00:34:00]  People don't realize that the less you're on the air  The better you feel anyway  Right  I want to get it down to where I'm just on a minute  That's it  That's our goal, too  I want to call in an attack  I gotta go take it  I gotta go take it  I want to attack their website, I think  Really?  Yeah  I don't like those guys over there  Bring it down  Bring down RonFez.net  Yeah, I like RonFez.net  And I think Whackbag should attack them  Oh, wow  Geez  Oh, start a war between them 
[00:34:30]  I'm not sure yet  I haven't officially called it an attack  Going to the mattresses  But I'm thinking about it  Instead of attacking  I don't like what they're writing over there  Instead of attacking the whole website  Just attack KOP  Because he's behind all the hate  Is that?  Yeah  He's the hater?  Yeah  One guy said that power-hungry monster Opie  Wanted to just extend his power  And show everybody how much power he has  By leaving you guys out there  That's not what I meant  You know, that post I actually agree with 
[00:35:00]  That's the one post I agree with  Who's KOP?  He's, uh, let's just say a friend of Fez's  If you know what I'm saying  Oh, is that it?  He and Fez would, uh, get together  And he's very, uh, possessive of Fez  And what, yeah  What Fez does  Yeah, okay  Protective  The P is an initial  That's an actual word  Yeah, so there was a little thing  I saw that because I read it on Whackbag  Yeah  That there was a problem 
[00:35:30]  So I went over there to read some of the posts  And apparently, yeah  Very upset that you guys weren't brought in sooner  We're going to go back outside  And let Opie finish doing his nails  And, uh, eat the fresh fruit that's brought into him  By little virgin girls  You guys, if you're ready, sit down, man  All right, we're ready  There you go  I didn't mean it  I was just trying to look good  I just came in off the street  And heard the embarrassment  Of, uh, one of my guys just blasting your music 
[00:36:00]  Wow  Oh, that was really loud  You guys have your words  I don't know how it sounded in Radio Land  Yeah, it is, it's awful  You know, it was a flashback to when we first got here  And, and, uh, kind of a prelude to what you guys are going to have to go through  Uh, it's just such a pain in the ass to get everybody up to speed  Well, I noticed that your staff just looks at our staffs like, uh, like retards  In a public school  Remember how there would be the one retard class in the public school?  That's our staff right now  Your staff is walking around with hockey helmets  Harry's from Armenia 
[00:36:30]  They have to play the music loud there to hear it over the explosion  Oh, that might be it  And the earthquakes  Yeah, there's a reason  The one guy we don't want to screw around with is that Arab kid  Because he's scary  He's going to keep you on your toes  Yeah  How did, uh, how did they get him?  Like, did we give him?  Yeah, we pretty much said  Rachel profiling  There's like slave trading going on  Well, Harry's hysterical  Harry scared us because he started, what, uh, sending us, um, uh, instant feedback  Yeah, here's what Harry's going to do for you 
[00:37:00]  From the cubicles  And, uh, it was, it just got a little too weird  Harry's going to come up with material  We know he's a talented kid and all  But  Song parodies maybe  Dude, he used to work on their show  Yeah  Harry helped them out  And then he'll, uh, he'll go to his, his computer over there  And instant feedback  Hey, why don't you play that funny bit I heard yesterday  And it's his bit  Yeah  It's him requesting his bit under an assuming  And we caught him  And ever since, it's been a little creepy  Yeah, he does that while everyone else is searching his backpack  The weird thing is he learned that from Fez 
[00:37:30]  Fez has done that to me before  I just, you know, we're doing the show and I'll hear  Uh, can I hear more of the gay guy?  I'm like, Fez?  Is that you?  Just going out for animal crackers  And by the way, he is wearing a gayer shirt than my periwinkle shirt  That is  I can't see it  He's got the  The Armenian flag  The fag rainbow  Is that the fag rainbow in front?  I think it's the fag rainbow  I thought he played for the old Astros  What?  Wow, very good  Wow, yeah  What is with the shirt, my friend?  It's just a shirt that happens to have a rainbow on it 
[00:38:00]  Really?  Look at the bumper  I like the attitude  I like the attitude you come in here with  Like a gay parade float  Why don't you just call him fuckface before I knock you out?  That, really  Just because you're working for another show  Doesn't mean I can't get you thrown right out of here still  No, I just  The shirt  There's nothing  I will leg sweep you right here on the fucking floor  That'll be it  That is a very gay shirt  You really can't defend that shirt  And that's coming from a guy that wore the periwinkle shirt  You know, first of all, the shirt  It got dropped to him in Turkey out of a fucking plane  And threw it on 
[00:38:30]  And had a quick meal  That's how they get all their clothes  We could have a new contest  It would be a matter where the Triscuits  New contest, gayest shirt on the show  He wins  It's game over  I think you can find a gayer one than this  It's just  No  No  That is, if you walk down the street  I'm just being honest with you  People will assume  That you're gay  Just based on the shirt  Because it looks like that rainbow  That the gay people wear  That's like their calling card  That is like wearing  A shirt  With a swastika on it  And saying 
[00:39:00]  No, it's just a nice symbol  It has nothing to do with me being a Nazi  They're going to assume that he's gay  Not so much from the shirt  But the dick up his ass  And the other one in his mouth  Why do you?  Because in Armenia  That doesn't really make you gay  Right  I don't know how they do that  Makes you right around it  Six times a day  He bends down the mech  And takes one in the can  It's a way to earn bread  And I don't mean money  I mean bread  Oh, actual bread?  Yeah  Yeah, that's sad then  I didn't think of that  Yeah  Just saying  I got no problem 
[00:39:30]  No, I'm not  A guy wearing nothing but pasties  Doesn't have as gay a top as that  Right  A top?  Did you just call it?  A top  What a nice blouse  I can tell  My show's just going to suck  I don't know what I'm doing here  Yeah, good luck to you  Yeah, it feels good  Good luck, bro  It feels good so far, right?  That is the clothing equipment  Of being in a rest area  Going pssst  It's bad, Harry  You see a flash of that shirt  Through a glory hole  A little rainbow color 
[00:40:00]  Before that red tongue  Comes sticking through  You're like, Harry?  Harry  A mocha colored finger  Comes through  Crooked at you  Mocha colored  So it's the last day  For this shirt  Stop  It's the last day for you  Stop it  Didn't work out  Anyone else?  Who else is going over  To your show?  That's it  That's the  You got Earl  Him and Earl  Right now  We're already studying  Our guys  Yeah  Well, I noticed  That you guys  Got all the white guys  And I'm like  How late did Fez and I 
[00:40:30]  Get here?  I got the black guy  The Arab and the fag  On some fucking  Mod squad  Intellectual dodgeball  Alright, we'll keep the lights  We got the Danny DeVito  Half of the twins  Producers  Wiki's gonna take me  To the zoo later  I'm in the retard squad  That'll make for an interesting  Yeah, it will  Sure  Plus who really  Is gonna have time to listen  Oh, you'll be surprised 
[00:41:00]  My friend  So many other stations  Here on XM to listen to  They got 8,000 programs  On this platform  A little big pain in the ass  Well, where's Earl?  Earl is actually awake  And here today  Yeah  Let's bring Earl in  Earl's the executive producer  Of the Ron and Fez show  Executive  Yeah  And the show starts off  I'm an executive  Monday  First in his family  Yeah  Look how pissed he is  Coming in the door  Yeah  Both my guys are so cocky  Black Earl in his black clothing 
[00:41:30]  That's why we call him Black Earl  He just wears black clothes  And he's working the goatee  Wow  Ooh, it's nice  Starting a new look  As an executive producer  Ow, welcome to 1984  It's coming off Sunday  Is it?  You gonna go back to  A Billy Dee Williams mustache?  No, nothing at all  No?  Ooh  It's clean shaved  All right  You're working hard?  Yeah  What do you got on the agenda today?  To get ready for the big debut of the show on Monday?  I don't know  All right 
[00:42:00]  It's a train wreck  Well  It's a train wreck  All right, that's what you want to hear, Ron  From your executive producer  Did you get it, Jimmy?  No, he ducked  Jimmy's taking pictures of Earl's cock  Who wouldn't?  Who wouldn't?  It's something that I have on his trip to L.A.  Just to think about New York  Yeah  Oh, yeah, this is my friend Earl  Earl, this is the last day before, you know, the big debut  I guess he's just getting pumped up for work  You're getting all your ideas together  And you'll consolidate it all this weekend  Yeah, that's it 
[00:42:30]  And then Monday  You're going to be running around like crazy today, right?  What are you going to be doing?  Well, we've got a party today at BB King's  And then Earl has a party before that  He has an N.E.W. farewell party  The last person leaving N.E.W.  Is that it?  Yeah  Yeah, they wanted to throw me a party  I didn't want it  But  Yeah, the old sinking ship party  Is that what it is?  They're going to lower a lifeboat for you  Was the word lynch in front of party?  Ring the bell 
[00:43:00]  You don't have to ring the bell  It was a serious question  Yeah, exactly  You're having a going away party at N.E.W.?  Yeah, they wanted to throw me something  Is it Frankie Blue throwing you the party?  So if it is, cut it  Because you definitely don't want the whole potency  Where's the going away party?  At the station  Oh, it's going to be an awful party  What an awful affair this is going to be  Can you invite your friends?  Good luck, Earl on the cake 
[00:43:30]  I have no idea  Again, I wanted  I didn't want a party  He'll go around back  And find all of his possessions in the dumpster  They're having us at Muni's grave  Oh, wow  Oh, stop it  That was a good one  Grab your mic  Earl  That's right, Earl  Alright, Earl  Well, that's good  He has his going away party  Sounds like he's well prepared for Monday  Monday comes along  And you're ready to go  Yeah 
[00:44:00]  Ready and raring  11 o'clock, Monday morning  Sound confident  Yes, I am confident  Oh, God  You know, Opie recommended somebody else for a show once  Didn't you?  The radio chick  Remember?  I didn't...  What?  You got...  What's his name, his job over there?  Chuck  Chuck  Chuck Nice  You are like the angel to black people  Yeah, I did actually  That's right  You did  I forgot about that  Wow  Well, we didn't want him on our show 
[00:44:30]  That's all that was about  Oh yeah, because Chuck was pushing to try to, you know, get more involved with our show  And I'm like, ah  And then I, you know, I introduced him to the radio show  Like, this guy's great  You've got to pick him up  And Earl's been trying to get involved with our show for a very long time  He does deflects black people  You're like a gated community  Yeah, I hope he's the security gate  I'm sorry you'll have to leave  But they'll take you over there  This here's a wife's only program, sir  All right, I guess you're on to something there 
[00:45:00]  Eric Gusta  Right  All right, Mr. Opie  I'll be here with Ronald Fizz  Thank you, sir  I'd like you, sir  I'd like you to produce your program  I could have you shot for that  They call me Mr. Douglas  Well, instead of giving him to us  Why don't you just hand him a ham  And that would have  That would have taken care of any white guilt you have  We didn't land on Opie  Opie landed on us  Yeah, Earl 
[00:45:30]  Come on, man  Help me out  You know, the pressure is on us  The pressure on you is huge  Because it's not only the pressure to do a good program  Or produce a good program for these guys  It's Opie's credibility with Ron and Fez now  It was my recommendation  Right  Ron personally called me  We had a discussion about you  If he would have recommended some self-respecting white guy  Ah, whatever  He fucks up  Who cares, right?  It's his problem  Things go down 
[00:46:00]  But now it's Earl  And Opie's involved  And if there's a problem  Oh, it's just going to make friction  I'm playing a win  Yes  There you go  Saying all the right things  Wow, that sounded like Notre Dame's locker room right there, didn't it?  We should  We should touch that sign before we come into the studio every day  Play like a champion  Get us that sign, Earl  Earl's sign  Yeah  Come on, guys, let's win  We're not  Whatever  We're going to have a sign and take a week to hang it  Ah, because of his picture thing 
[00:46:30]  Yes  Should we play the Black Girl song?  Oh  I don't know  Does it make a fool out of Earl?  Yeah, it does  I don't want to see Earl made a fool out of her  Earl, you should learn to sing that song  You've changed  No, you don't want to hear me sing  All right, in honor of Earl, the executive producer of the Ron and Fez show  These guys starting up on Monday  Let's play the Black Earl song again  Everyone does love this  I was born and raised in New York City  In a housing project way up in the hood 
[00:47:00]  I dressed in dark clothing so folks started calling me Black Earl  Oh, and they used to laugh about it  Because deep down they knew they'd call me that  Because I was as black as soot  I've always been a lazy man  A couch potato with a clicker in my handsy  Motivation I never had  Hit in the shadows when the boss got mad  For twenty years I never got a raise  I'm thirty-three and I never feel late  I look busy but I'm not  I'm just walking around 
[00:47:30]  I pick up some papers and I put them back down  Someday I'm gonna stop paying my rent  Live in a refrigerator box  Never get out of bed  I'm black girl  A genuine lazy bum  I'll always make it through  Hard Johns at N-E-W  Then one day some lame brains came and took Owen A-way  And at the age of thirty-three 
[00:48:00]  I felt like I was carrying the weight of the whole station on my shoulders  And Ronnie Fezzy knew what I was going through  Every morning I'd unlock the door  Lay down and I'd sleep a little more  Then I'd put away the bathroom key  Everybody was depending on me  I'd eat a chicken wing with lemonade  Lord, give me strength to make another day  Times I felt I couldn't go on  Push a button, throw a switch, answer the phone 
[00:48:30]  Got lost in the band, I did my PSAs  Ten minutes work gonna take me all day  I'm black girl, a genuine lazy bum  I'll always make it through  Hard Johns at N-E-W  I could hear a stop zone say  Black girl, you're a genuine lazy bum  You'll always make it through 
[00:49:00]  Hard Johns at N-E-W  Goddamn, bravo  That's Brother Joe  One of his greatest  That one's gonna be so hard to beat  That's like his big hit  Yeah, it is for me  I swear, I do listen to that  My kids listen to it  It's done well  It's funny  He sang it very well 
[00:49:30]  And you could picture Earl doing everything in the song  Flipping a switch, answering the phone, going to sleep  That's Earl  Perfect  And Brother Joe will be headlining our Halloween party  Yes  Hopefully he'll do some song parodies besides the U2 stuff  What night of the week is that Halloween party?  Like a Monday or Tuesday  Oh, you're actually doing it on Halloween?  Oh, yeah  Oh, okay  Cool, I was hoping I was not gonna miss it  We're looking for the people to come in costumes based on the show also  That's right  I think that'd be very  We're gonna start talking about it big time 
[00:50:00]  But we just gotta finalize some things  Hey, I gotta say, I was chatting with Doug on line last night  And he directed me to the Lexentary message board  Uh-oh  Wow  An assault, eh?  It was  Well, no, I mean, there was a couple of thousand Open Entity posts  Dude, it was so awful  OA Party Rock  They know how to, they spam the site  Every fucking post was OA Party Rock  The board is ruined  They might have had it fixed by today 
[00:50:30]  But it was ruined last night  It'll just get ruined again  They'll ruin it again  Were there any clever names or was it just one guy just pounding?  Well, there was one ferret girl  Who I didn't even know  It was one  No, uh, L.N.T. Rule  Mm-hmm  L.N.T. Lexentary fan  Yeah  And then there was, uh, Jimmy Robinson  Jimmy Robinson, I like that  Pat Battle  There was a few of them  Pat Battle  I love the names  They come out of  Old Gravy Leg  Always been one of my favorites  Dace  Ben's hair  This is great  I love when Ben's hair poses 
[00:51:00]  Well, they made the mistake of saying we had no listeners  That's cute and all  But  That boy got smashed  Smashed  Good  Well, we got Doug on the line here  Oh, he's got to come back from yesterday's call, I guess  Hello, Doug  Good morning, fellas  You know you bombed yesterday on the show, right?  You absolutely know you bombed  I listened to the replay  I heard him come out with the, uh, his little opening joke  And it got nothing  What was the joke? I don't remember  It was something about, uh, the cell phones  What was it, Doug? 
[00:51:30]  Uh  Charging up the cell phone batteries or something?  I told the screener to listen real hard  That's the sound of 2,000 of my closest friends charging their cell phone  Cricket  And, but the thing is, I listened to the replay  You actually stopped and waited for something to happen there  Oh, you bombed  He wanted a big laugh  He wanted a big laugh  I think I kind of picked it up towards the end, though  It wasn't as bad as when myself and the Boston Strangler called in 
[00:52:00]  About the Baba Booey attack up in Boston  That was a fucking abortion  I don't know, the message board really isn't very sympathetic to you and your phone calls  Your, uh, your last few phone calls have been shaky at best  Yeah  If you don't do well today, I'm thinking of giving you to Ron and Fez  Oh, jeez  Are you black?  We're going to give Ron and Fez all our rejects, so  Yeah, and it doesn't matter if you step on the left there, so keep going  Just keep talking the whole time  Hey, I worked hard for you guys  We were up until 3 o'clock in the morning 
[00:52:30]  Smashing the message board until they finally took it offline  Oh, did they finally take it down?  They took the board offline  The problem is with the software that they're using  They have to erase each and every post and thread individually  And we had 25 pages of threads just in their main forum  Every single one of their forums, which they had a forum for each station they're on  And all different subject matter  Had at least 30 pages of different threads  I went from page 1 to page 25 
[00:53:00]  I just clicked on 25  And it was the same thing  OA Party Rock  I'm like, wow, some gentleman typed that about 3,000 times in a row in the same post  It was ruined  Yeah  We have pictures from tubgirl.org, I think it is  With the girl shitting  Oh, tubgirl  Oh, dude, who was the one that painted  Who was the one  I forgot the guy who put the guy  You know the bent over guy with the gaping red asshole open?  Oh, yeah, yeah  That was Jimmy Robinson  That's an old school one  That's a good one  That's been around for a while 
[00:53:30]  It's just some gay guy holding his asshole open  What was his name?  That was Jimmy Robinson  That was Jimmy Robinson  Okay, yeah, that was a classic  You open it up and there'd be like 30 of the exact same photo  Yeah  Lex and Terry fans are just getting disgusted  They're like, well, the Mods will fix this  Yeah  And meanwhile, there's 12 posts from Steve from Yellowstone  These guys are so brave  But obviously, they're not going to go with it on their own show  No  Bunch of pussies 
[00:54:00]  How is the attack going, Doug?  Right now, I sent some stuff in  I'm not sure if they got it yet  With me talking to their phone screener  They're not letting any of us through  It's incredible, really  Because I spent some time on their website, LexandTerry.com, last night  Reading their profiles  And they're so goddamn proud of their Harley Davidsons  Because that makes them tough  They wear the flannel shirts  They take pictures by fences  You ride rollerblades  And fucking drink wine by a java log 
[00:54:30]  And Anthony won't even shit in a public toilet  And you guys will fucking take calls from assholes  And these guys won't  They are fucking pathetic  So around 9 o'clock last night  I came up with an idea  I'm going to put out there for everybody  We put $200 worth of a bounty  On LexandTerry's head  Over the next couple of days  We're doing $25 for the first Moira reference  $25 for the first Jimmy reference  What, that actually makes the air, right?  Correct  $50 for a successful tandem call 
[00:55:00]  And $100 for the call  That is most talked about by you guys  I love this  The O&A Army, the past  They got projects now  They got better prizes  Yeah, they're giving out prizes  The problem is  Cold hard cash  With the Russ Martin commercial  We went through all the trouble  Of making a commercial  And then nobody would air it  Because it mentioned Russ Martin's name  It can't be funny  And not mention Russ Martin  So we kind of had to pack that one in 
[00:55:30]  That's alright  Not every project's going to work there, pal  We had money left over  So we figure, let's put a bounty  On these assholes' heads  To keep the incentive up  And everybody can put a little coin  In their pocket  And if they want  They can turn around  And they can put the money  Into the hurricane relief fund  That you guys got going on  Too on eBay  Hey, are they  So Lex and Terry  Not even acknowledging  That their message board  Was crashed?  No  Of course not  On screen are all about it  This morning  They  What's their phone number?  1-877  What is it? 
[00:56:00]  1-800  1-800  What is it?  977  Do me  Do us  Do us  Yep  And they did  They fucked that message board good  A big whack bag cock  Right into it  Hey, Martini Steve  Has entered the studio  He can't get it started this morning  He had to get a rental car  Because his hybrid car  Didn't start this morning  Right  Exactly  Steve just handed something in here 
[00:56:30]  Steve?  Yeah  Doug sent me some audio  Of him versus the  Lex and Terry phone screener  It's a short little succession  Of clips of him  Jousting back and forth  Or not jousting  Fencing back and forth  How many times did he call there, Doug?  About 30  Between 5  5.30  And uh  Wow  When I got on hold with you guys  Around 7  And we got a montage  Of some of the better things  Alright, let's listen to this  There's the phone ringing  Lex and Terry  Hey, what happened to your message board? 
[00:57:00]  Huh?  The Lex and Terry message board  What happened to it?  I don't know  We fucked it up, stupid  Great editing  What do you say  When a TV is floating  Around your bedroom  The answer is 
[00:57:30]  Nigger  Drop my television  Holy crap  What's wrong with you?  Lex and Terry  Hold me  Lex and Terry  Sheriff, you sounded taller  Over the radio  I need two, three rings open 
[00:58:00]  Mike and Terry  Hey man, what's up?  Not much  Doug just being an ass  Yeah, that's what I do best  That was beautiful  That was pretty funny  And that just went on and on  Yeah, yeah  Off with pests  I tried to get through 
[00:58:30]  With a serious call  They had some girl in there  So I was trying to do  Like a relationship issues call  And they got the caller ID  Up and running  So a few of the guys  Using the spoof teller  Are trying to get through also  But  I guess they're not that brave  After all, huh?  No  They saw my area code  From 757  Which is up here  In Virginia Beach  So  They knew I wasn't from  Any part of their listening area  So they told me  They wanted to call me back  Etc  So I figured  I'd just have fun  With the golfer  Answering the phone  So how  It's amazing how 
[00:59:00]  Like these guys  They all  Their shows get dominated  Pretty easily  Because they have to start  Panicking about callers  Getting through  And they're not going to get  Who they think  They're getting on the phone  How could we never  Worry about that?  We'd like Lex and Terry  Call us to call  Go ahead  Call  Who gives a shit?

[01:03:00]  That affected  His ability to drink  Really  Which he used to  Do well with  Yeah after  Everything that happened  I kind of went  Into a funk  Yeah  Well you know  A lot of  A lot of crying  Jags  A lot of things  Happened  And then ended up  On like five  Different antidepressants  Mood stabilizers  And booze  What were you on  I started off  On the Zoloft  Which gave me  Crazy shakes  Crazy shakes  Yeah I couldn't  Stop shaking my hands  And my knee  Would keep going  Wow  I got put on 
[01:03:30]  Lithium  Lamictal  Now lithium  You almost got to  Be a retard  To be on lithium  I mean that's like  Oh I was  Son of Sam  Gets lithium  Yeah lithium  Wow  Lexapro  Klonopin  Klonopin  Kloni's  Nice  Yeah the Kloni's  Were good  Nice  That was the one  Part that was enjoyable  Have you guys  Ever been on  Like everybody I know  Is on Zoloft  Or something  Have you guys  Ever went on  Any of that stuff  I did a little  Valium when I  Had my eyes done  Yeah  But never  Vicodin for a tooth  Yeah  I took some of that  Vicodin 
[01:04:00]  And I still  I still have some  Yeah  This is how good  Vicodin is  I was given the  Prescription  By the dentist  Had it filled  Went home  Took one  Right  Never took Vicodin  In my life  Took one  The second I started  Feeling the effects  I grabbed the bottle  And counted how many  I had left  And I was pissed  That I only had that many  And every time  I took another one  I was like  One less  God damn it  One less  That shit  Is the best drug 
[01:04:30]  Ever made  Welcome to my entire life  Welcome to Club Braun  I always  No matter what drug  I ever took  I mean even when  I was a little kid  I would think to myself  Why would anyone  Want to feel anything else  But this drug  Yeah  And as a kid  You bring that up  It was the same thing  With things like cookies  Right  Or something  You'd be eating the cookies  And go  I only have three cookies left  Damn it  Gotta eat them sparingly  That's how I felt  I did the same thing  With my Valium 
[01:05:00]  Then I'm cutting them in half  To sacrifice the buzz  A little bit  Gotta save it  So you have it  A little longer  I got my eyes done  And it gave me like  I think just  Ten lousy Valiums  The lowest dose  But man  I think it lasted a year  You'd just giggle to yourself  Right  Like I'd get up  To take a leak  And I'd stand up  And just go  Like you're enjoying  The feeling so much  And that's why  Do you ever go to a hospital  And somebody is just  Tranked up  Where they can  Actually sit there  And work the methadone 
[01:05:30]  Or whatever  Work it  Yeah  Whatever opiate  That they happen to be on morphine  And they're just like  They're just telling you  All their problems  And the thumb never stops  The thumb is just going  Constantly  Yeah that doesn't sound  Like a safe thing  Right  And it'll be your grandmother  You know what I mean  Like it'll be somebody  Who's never been around  Opiates in their life  And they're just  Taking an hour  To light a cigarette  Like they're playing  A playstation game  Your thumb's a flying  Grandma  We'll just pump that  She's Miles Davis  Ten minutes later 
[01:06:00]  Just playing a trumpet  Hating white people  It's so shit  Strange  It's so strange  I probably should be on something  But I don't want to lose  The edge there  I don't want to be this mellow  Look at the edge he got  Well yeah  Nothing worked  You got edgier  You got edgier?

Yes we did have the opportunity  To meet the legend Lee Abrams  Hey  How's it going?  Welcome aboard  Thank you  The mad scientist of radio  Yes  So  You guys are interested  In maybe a gold  Platinum record?  Yeah  We could use a couple of those  Well  Who is the artist?  Well  I've got an A, B and a C list  Now the A list  You know  Maybe in the case of  Nuclear War  You can have  That's my door  Zeppelin  Kiss 
[01:11:00]  Now however  The B list  Is  We'll get to that in a sec  Because that's the ones  I think you'll be interested  Then there's a C list  You can have as many as you want  That's Rick Springfield  Steelheart  Winger  Winger  I'll take it  Count me in  Now  So let's talk about the B list  We've got  This is from the personal collection  A  Ozzy Osbourne Platinum  Uh oh  This is not the imitation kind  You can buy at  Pier 1 import  This is the real thing  Is it in a fine wood frame?  Why is that a B list, sir? 
[01:11:30]  You're pissing off Jimmy Norton  Jimmy is fuming  Well  The reason is  A couple reasons  One  Is it's at the top  It's at the top of the B list  But  You know  I'm old  And what really matters to me  Are those  You know  Those  Led Zeppelins  And Doors  And those kind of things  Those are your  That's emotional  B list means  These are fucking great  But it's really not  You know  Just like  Emotionally  Critical to me 
[01:12:00]  And C list  You know  Now the Ozzy  What record is it for?  This is Ultimate Sin  It's not the cliche  You know  The other ones  This is  And it's  You know  It's Platinum  Platinum  Now also  I'm looking at the wall here  I'm just getting some other artists  Offspring  That's a cool one  I know you don't want  Yes  Although they're cool  You got any more Ozzy  Or Sabbath  Well I might have  Yeah at home  I think I have  A Paranoid 
[01:12:30]  But I gotta look for that one  We'll take the yes one  By the way  Someone out there  Would want  Sure  I'm Paranoid  How many do you want  One or two  One or two  Three  That would be next  Alright how about  We give you the Ozzy  I mean  That's hot  And I know  And actually one of the reasons  I put that on the B list  Meaning you know  I'm giving it to you guys  Is because I know  Norton loves him  And you know  He's huge 
[01:13:00]  And he's major  So you know  It's really an A-lister  But it's one of those ones  I put on the B list  Because the B list ones  Are the ones I want to give you guys  And how about  Paranoid  If you find that at home  I mean for Pete's sake  Yeah that's  That's kind of an A-lister  But let me check  Yeah he ain't giving you that one  He might  Hey Lee  You send up what you can  Alright  Hey done  I'll have him send out today  Some gold and platinum records  From Lee Abrams  Let me ask you a question  How does  Like what you have  Is a real platinum  Like it's a real one  From the record company  How do they decide 
[01:13:30]  Who to give them to  Well I think there's  Three things  One  Just guys  That got to schmooze  Because they have a lot of  You know  A lot of  Listeners in their market  And they figure  Regardless if they even  Heard of the artist  They'll give them the platinum  Or gold record  Just to like  Oh  When they're begging  For their next record  To get played  They'll say  Hey I gave you that platinum record  For so and so  You know  You play this artist  Nobody's ever heard of  Oh yeah  Thanks for that platinum  You know  My wife's real impressed  And all that  Then there's the type  That you actually were 
[01:14:00]  Really early on the record  And you know  Instead of a cash payout  They really show their appreciation  Through the gold  Or platinum record  Then there's the guys  Who actually were involved  In the music  Whether it was  You know  Production team  Or you know  Somebody at the label  That really you know  Sort of nurse the record  Through the process  The payola people  Yeah payola  Absolutely  Yeah  And a lot of times  The ultimate payola is  Cocaine  Well yeah  As we used to say 
[01:14:30]  Hey Lee remember this  Hey that sure smells like a hit  Hey  Don't go to the bathroom  How about you  Get over here  With that album and a razor  Let's go  I want to hear it all  Yeah  I don't know if we should go there  But for some other time  We must  Yeah it all happened  Lee we know it  It's just in the past  We're not stupid  Right  It was fun  But it was that way  In the past  Yep  Alright  And a lot of terrible music  Got played on rock radio 
[01:15:00]  Oh it was unbelievable  In the 80's  There were cocaine records  You know  No question about it  And uh  God  Some of them like  Tested well  If you still hear them  It's like  Oh my god  If you only knew  Why that record  Got played in the first place  What are you most embarrassed  About putting on the  On the radio Lee  What's the worst thing  That you ever got behind  Oh you know  I'd have to say  Some of those  Just real cheesy  Shitty hair band  Songs  In the mid 80's  You know  I'm looking at  Some of them now  And you know  I'm sure the guys 
[01:15:30]  Actually I met  The other nice guys  But you know  Looking at a gold record  For Steelheart  Right  They sucked  You know  Britney Fox  And all these  And again  You know  I'm sure they're fine musicians  And all that  But  What about dangerous toys  You know  Dangerous toys  We  I used to run a thing  Called Z-Rock  Which is like  Metal channel  In the 80's  And every summer  We had these pool parties  Where we'd invite  Everybody  At my house  And I mean  They'd start at noon  On Saturday  And end like  3pm Monday  Peeling people

[01:26:00]  But anyway  My husband called me  To tell me that  Stern's doing a tirade  About how he invented everything  And Gary even went so far  As to say that  Some people might say  On Howard  That you invented breathing  So they're definitely listening to you  Of course they do  I guess Howard  Didn't prepare for a show today  I guess so  He pulls that out of his back pocket  Every time he doesn't have much on his show  Alright Jenny  Thank you  Thank you  Bye  Bye miss  Although it could just be a best of 
[01:26:30]  Could be a best of  From years ago  From last week  Right  Paul what's up  This is Paul  Hi Paul  Hey Paul  Yeah I'm from Kansas City  Working down in Jacksonville  And I tuned in to the douches  At Lexington Terry over here  And the first thing they're doing  Is bashing you guys  And the army  And the army  They don't want to bash the army  Trust me  And it's not an army  It's a bunch of pests  They said to have the army  Bring it on  In so many words 
[01:27:00]  If I can paraphrase  Okay okay  Army bring it on  These faggots  Whose message boy  Was crashed in an hour  1-800-977-DOUUS  D-O-U-US  D-O-U-US  That was just a little  Verbal text  You're just a little confused  Because it's your birthday  I get scared  I should sing it  1-800-977-DOUUS  Call them  Because they're saying  Bring it on  And they're a couple of 
[01:27:30]  Fucking Florida dullards  With phony radio voices  They can't even be men  And talk the way  They normally talk  They gotta talk like that  They're fucking phonies  And they're cowards  And the army's gonna  Smash their faces  Alright  There you go  Douchebags  Lay waste  Let's say hi to Rich  In New Jersey  Rich  I didn't see it man  Let's bring Ben in here  Ben knows about  The Aussie thing  You saw it last night  You might as well  Since I asked for the  Michael Ralph poor bio  An hour ago  That hasn't showed up  Let's see if we can  Come to Boston 
[01:28:00]  I came in and Ben  Was just laughing  Uncontrollably  Like he usually does  But  Did he talk into a mic  That was on  Stupid  Yeah that mic  Wasn't on there  You got to  You have to  You have to  Wait a second  Did you even see it Jim  No I didn't  He sucked  I saw it  He's older  He sucks  The stones are old  They kicked his ass  Ah he's got a point there  The stones are old  The stones were good last night  The stones are definitely  Better live performers 
[01:28:30]  But so much  None of them are as  Interesting as  You know what it is  You know what it is too though  Why he would agree to let  Bob Kraft interrupt him  Throughout the song  Bob Kraft is a douche  That's why  There you go  That's why it happened  Because Kraft is a douche  Three world championships  Who cares  He didn't win them  Was Ozzy lip syncing  He's shitting to his diapers  Steve and I  Just seem to think so  A lot of people think  That Ozzy was lip syncing  Well then they heard  His mic on  His voice was really hoarse  Let's hear it  And I'll tell you  So now he's singing  And it sounds good  Yeah 
[01:29:00]  And then he stops  To talk  Into the mic  And he's all raspy  And can't talk  Very rarely  If you're lip syncing  Are you going to talk  I'll let you know  Immediately  If he's lip syncing  All right  Here to perform  Crazy Train  The Patriots  Traditional entrance anthem  Ozzy Osbourne  Here to perform  It's lip syncing  Stop  What was that  That's the intro  Yeah  That's the album  That's the album  Right  If they're introing the album  It's lip syncing  But then again  Maybe Ozzy went live 
[01:29:30]  I don't think so  That's live  That's live  Oh that's live  Well now  Hold on  But these guys  Will explain what they saw  Steve and Ben  Now they can  They can then start  The lip sync music  Explain what's called  A click track  And there's a vocal  On the click track  That is processed  With all kinds of vocal effects  And that's what kicks in  And that's what's obvious  Right  Then you can just  Stop singing  Anytime you want  And that takes over  And then you can talk 
[01:30:00]  Like  Or you kind of sing  Along with your own voice  Is that what they're  Is that what you're doing  Yeah  That would probably be bad  Let's hear it  Let's give it a listen  That's live  Uh oh  That's absolutely not a lip sync 
[01:30:30]  It's some type of  Retorting though  There's something going on there  Let's hear this  You might be singing along with something 
[01:31:00]  But that's live  I will say  I will say  What I think  Is going on here  That probably for a while now  They've had pre-recorded live tracks  They don't take it off the album  Right  But at some point  They went in somewhere  Or did a recording  Of a live performance  And they used that vocal track  A lot of bands do it  With backing vocals  But you don't  A lot of times  You don't really hear it  With lead vocals 
[01:31:30]  Unless the person's doing  A lot of dancing  Like a bridge  Of yours or something  Ozzy's sound though  Has always been that  Doubled vocal thing too  So it's kind of like  They're throwing it  Behind him anyway  I can tell you  When I saw him with Sabbath  Recently  I mean  He sounded better live  Than I've seen him in years  I think because he's clean  And sober now  So for him to get through  A one song  Because his voice  Didn't crack until  Paranoid the time I saw him  Which was great  Yeah but he's also  Had to cancel all those shows  On Ozcaster  It's live for whole shows  Dude but for one song  I think he could  That was live  So maybe it was  If he was singing along  With something  He was singing along with it  But it sounded live 
[01:32:00]  Well you'll hear it later on  But he does have a live  Mic in front of him  But I think he's lip syncing  To track  Because when the lead vocals  And the processed vocals  Drop out  He shouts at the crowd  And that's real obvious  Let's hear  Yeah 
[01:32:30]  Phenomenal  His little jersey  How do you not love him?  I know that things  Are going up to me  You've got to listen  To my words  Yeah  No way 
[01:33:00]  Wait a minute  Everybody grab your hands  Come on  I want to see a wild crowd  Hey hey hey hey hey hey  Come on 
[01:33:30]  Andy Osborne  Give it up  We are now just moments away  From kickoff  And still to come  Trisha Yearwood  Trisha Yearwood  Did everybody else sing full song?  Stones did two songs  With Green Day  With one  I wonder why he was interrupted  Unless it was a time thing  Or unless because  Well how they set it up  That's what the team  Runs out to normally 
[01:34:00]  So he did a lot  But the team was running out  So he was in a big football helmet  Oh maybe that's  Alright maybe  What?  Poor Ozzy  Poor Ozzy  So odd  That's probably why  He was singing with  He was singing with background vocals  That was definitely  With him last night too  Yeah I know  I saw a picture  But that was  With background vocals  That's all  There's something going on  Because he was very clean  You heard it  Very clean and crisp  Vocals  And then he  I would rather have heard him  Sing it like that  Fallen  I love it  I have a tape of Ozzy  In like 1981 
[01:34:30]  It's live  I think it was Randy  When he's opened  Over the mountain  And he cracks  By the second verse  Of his opening song  It's my fucking  Favorite audio  Ever captured  It's great  He can't get through  The first song  I feel so bad though  Bashing Ozzy  In front of Jimmy  It's like you're bashing  His dad or something  You're bashing Ozzy  He's fucking  He should have been  Dead in 1975  The fact that he's still  Standing in a little  Football helmet  Good for him  That fucking  That faggot Jim Morrison  Saying people are strange  And fell face first  Into his soup  Allegedly 
[01:35:00]  Yeah exactly  You know what's weird  I think there was even  A vocal track for the audience  I don't know  I don't think that was  Actually people that into it  Yeah I know  What's going on  When he was going  A A  Because he'll do that  In between songs  The crowd was responding  So that could be  You might be right  It might have been  A live track dub  I was in Atlanta  And that Tomahawk chop  Thing that they do  That thing is vocal track  So I'm sitting there  And I hear it  Yeah  And then  It comes up  On the PA  And then people start 
[01:35:30]  Like little lemmings  Start to go along  I'm like what the fuck  Yeah  A lot of bands  That used to play arenas  But are now playing the clubs  They do that  To sort of like  Beef their egos up  They track a lot of vocals  And I'm not kidding  About that  There's only 300 people  But he doesn't need  He doesn't need to track  A happy crowd reaction  It just happens  You can't help you  See you can't stop  Fun up  You just get into it  Football helmet  It's Christmas  Football helmet  Yeah  That's where you should stand  On the opening day  I see some photoshops  Out of that one  And that was actually 
[01:36:00]  That was actually  The Little League helmet  That Ben used to wear  All right  Ron and Fez in the studio  You guys are doing a thing today  We should promote that  Oh yeah  Oh yeah  Because we're all going  It turns out  Yeah the whole gang's  Heading out there  BB Kings  That's this afternoon  5.30  It starts free beer  BB Kings in Times Square  5.30 to 7.30  And everybody's going right  You're in Ope  I'm in  In  And then Jimmy  This is also like  A little good luck to Jimmy  Well it's more of a birthday bash  Yeah it is  It's a birthday bash  Happy birthday 
[01:36:30]  And a big present for Jimmy  And Brian Regan might make it  Because we're going to  Brian Regan later tonight as well  Yeah Brian Regan said  He definitely wants to come  He goes  He's got this Conan thing  I go you can still be there  You can still be there Brian  But he's that nice  He's trying to figure out  How he can like  Squeeze in this party  In between his gig at Caroline  You troubled him  And his Conan appearance  And hurricane relief efforts  And now Jimmy is going to find  The dark side of Regan  He said he's going to find out  What Regan is actually 
[01:37:00]  There's something there  Skeletons maybe  There's got to be  The old days  Yeah  Something awful too  Yeah  Yeah  It's not good stuff  We saw him after a few beers  During your show  A couple of times  And yeah  He knows how to party  A little bit  Oh yeah  He's always been a drinker  Yeah  But you know  God knows what happens  After everyone else leaves  Right  He likes to bite prostitutes  On the fat of their back  You know what  It's so weird  I used to know this comic  His name  Well I don't know  If I should say his name  But he was  This black guy  That was the overly nicest guy 
[01:37:30]  In the world  Vince  Vince Champ  Yeah  And I mean  He was a good buddy  To everybody  Would help everybody  Get gigs  And when you shake your hand  It would be too hard  You know one of those guys  Yeah  And then later  Found out that  He had this string of rapes  And the way that they found out  Is like  They figured out his comic  His itinerary  Of this college tour  Wow  That he had done 
[01:38:00]  Because he was in towns  Where there was no black guys at all  You know what I mean  Like little small towns in Iowa  And  Paradise  Yeah  Utopia of the island  Asshole  What's that like  I'm honestly trying to tell a story  From my heart  Of course you are  Turn this into a KKK meeting  But like some FBI guy  You know  Doing numbers  Like the numbers guy  On CBS  Figured it out  Like what would a black person  Be doing  In each one of these towns 
[01:38:30]  It's like some CSI shit  Yeah  He was so weirded out with it  Like he didn't want to rape  You know like  It was like  A whole other part of his personality  And after he was done raping them  He would make them pray  With them  Like it's not bad enough  Wow  Yeah  Being raped  Now you have to pray with them  And you guys knew this comic?  Yeah  I met him  I just  No I didn't know him  I just knew his  I knew him for years  And I mean  I would have swore  He had nothing  To do with it  He's still in jail  He got in a lot of jail  Yeah  I mean  He was raping white women? 
[01:39:00]  Yeah  Oh wow  I mean if you're going to rape  In Wichita  Yeah  Well first of all  Wow  He is a ballsy motherfucker man  I think he raped some black women  But no one believed them  So  You know how Bush feels  You very kind  Yeah  He was a great comedian  Brock Peters  All right  We're going to step aside  Can we play the Fez audio  When we get back?  Yeah  Is this going to be uncomfortable?  Oh yeah  Of course  That's the best reason to play it  Well that's what I was hoping for  And then I think we've got to do 
[01:39:30]  The 60s, 70s, 80s, and 90s  We have to do our Sam Channel interviews  Oh good luck there  Are you kidding?  Yeah  Yeah we've got to do that too today  Do them in here  In here?

[01:52:00]  Sponsored  Sponsored  Sponsored  Really  And I ate at Ron's house  Every night  With his family  Really  How was that  And Ronnie has a wife  And some kids right  Yeah  Yeah there's two of them  What did you have to do  Hold her in your palm  And feed her with an eyedropper  Thank you  A little bird body  It was her first time  She had traveled anywhere  It was her first time  On a plane  I loved it  Yes  And flying back  She was so excited  She didn't want to 
[01:52:30]  Miss her flight  In the morning  She slept on my couch  Fully clothed  In her shoes  Ready to go out the door  To the airport  Like a fighter pilot  Ready to scramble  You are something there lady  I love looking out the window  What I wouldn't get  To go on another plane ride  It's fun  Take off and landing  Is the best  I love it  It's so cool  I'd love to send you  On a plane ride in Greece  That'd be nice  No I just never traveled  On a plane before  So it was so fascinating  It was awesome  It was what? 
[01:53:00]  Exhilarating  Let's send her to New Orleans  Why does her joy  Make me physically ill?  I don't know  There's something about her  That's just fascinating  Fascinating  Exhilarating  Thrilling  Maybe because the joy  Of a 50 year old  When it comes out  Sounding like somebody  Who's four  Which is kind of bugging  How would you like  To be on the plane  Next to her  As she's acting  Like she's one  Of the right brothers  I did say something  Inappropriate  While I was on the plane  We were going down  For the landing  I'm like  Oh my god  We're going down 
[01:53:30]  You don't say that  On a plane  Oh well  That would have been  An awful plane ride  Look the clouds  Were going above them  The guy's looking  Hoping a mountain  Is coming  Everybody else  Is like sleeping  And everything  And my eyes  Are glued to the window  And I'm looking down  And everywhere  They weren't sleeping  They were politely  Telling you to  Shut the fuck up  They were all  Praying for a crash  And then when I  Landed on the plane  And arrived in Washington 
[01:54:00]  I got a hand  Clapped like applause  They said  This is her first time  On a plane seat  12A  Or whatever  Everybody clapped for me  They never said  This was her first time  On a plane seat  On a plane seat  Why would they say that  I took her around  To the D.C. memorials  She got into an argument  In one of the gift shops  Because she bought  A ruler  With all the presidents  On it  And she insisted  That a president 
[01:54:30]  Was missing  She's screaming  Where's Stephen Grover Cleveland  I didn't know  They were the same person  And he was re-elected twice  With McKinley in between  Third grade gifts  She's  Yeah  That's a field trip gift  When you went on a field trip  Right  To maybe you know  Third grade gifts  You go to Washington  I remember going to the  Museum of Natural History  And I got a little snow globe  With a dinosaur in it  A pencil case  Yeah  That's what you get  Because you wanted to spend 
[01:55:00]  The whole five bucks  Your grandmother gave you  So as you were leaving  You would buy anything  To use up to five bucks  Did you leave your lunch  In the seat on the plane  For your return trip back  No  I'm just fascinated  I'm one of the few people  That can name most  Of the capitals of the states  I think I named  Most of the presidents  Did Ronnie have to sign  Your permission slip  When you came back to New York  No  I'm just fascinated  By things like that  Fascinating  By a book  You tell me any state

[02:05:00]  Garbage  Human waste  And flooding corpses  Dr. Julie Gerberling  Director of Centers  For Disease Control  Says  If you haven't  Left the city yet  You must  Do so  There's a lot of  E. coli in the water  Supposedly  And there's been  Four deaths  From  Disease waters  In Texas  And Mississippi  In Texas 
[02:05:30]  Yep  I think it's the people  That went over there  Oh really  With it in the water  They took bottles  Of water with them  From the delta  Bathing in it  Yeah  Alright  Well that's a big story  Sure  Overshadowed by  The New Orleans  Tragedy  Everyone forgot  About this story  It's the Nancy  Kissel story  Nancy  Nancy is the woman  Who killed her husband 
[02:06:00]  Rabbit Kissel  By giving him  A strawberry milkshake  Laced with antidepressants  Hypnotic drugs  Then rolling him up  In a carpet  And clubbing him  To death  Wow that's creative  That reminds me  I call my mom  Very Italian  It's creative  Nancy 41  Claims that she was  Trapped in a nightmare  Marriage  In which she was  Forced to satisfy  Her drug fueled  Hubby's six sexual demands  At any moment 
[02:06:30]  Nancy  You're 41  Let's face it  Most women at your age  Aren't getting laid  Besides taking a couple  Of punches to the face  In a little sodomy  Or partaking in a little  Sexual activity  Is all part of the deal  When you get married  I like how she editorializes  The stories  My question is  How drugged out  Was this guy  That he didn't notice  He was being rolled  Into a rug  Whoa this is fun  And then she just 
[02:07:00]  Beats him through the rug  Dumb whore  Wouldn't it be easier  To beat him  Like when his head  Is right there  Instead of through  A heavy carpeting  Did she vacuum it first  She was  Nothing  I know that that shit  Was spiraling downward  Quickly  Quick more rug stuff  Enough with the carpet  I know  I'm obsessed  Yep  What did she hit him  With an orc  Go ahead  Do you lose your place 
[02:07:30]  Uh oh  Nancy  In life  Who is having an affair  With her TV repairman  Has been sentenced  To life in prison  Sounds right  I hope you get a curling iron  Shove down your twat  You selfish  Murderous cunt  Oh wow  Wow  That's harsh  And that's S.A.P.  Is she Ron Burgundy  She'll read anything  On the teleprompter  That's something you don't hear  On Good Morning America  Very classy  Wow  That's right  Shove a curling iron 
[02:08:00]  In your cunt  Back to you Frank  Alright go ahead  Francine  The MTA  New York City  Transit system  Is filled with a bunch  Of fucking  Blood sucking  Leashes  As execs  Leashes  Who should be  Pissing their pants  As a shuttle train  Derailed in Brooklyn  Says Mayor Bloomberg  At 3.11pm  I believe it was  Either Wednesday  Or Tuesday 
[02:08:30]  Or Tuesday  Ah  Doesn't really matter  The day  Right  Wednesday  Tuesday  Sunday  Friday  The New York  Post reports  The New York Post reports  That the shuttle  Was running  Without a conductor  Uh oh  Where was he  But New York City  Transit insists  That nothing  That had nothing  To do with the accident  I hope  I hope everyone on that train  I hope everyone on that train  Gets together and files  A class  Auction suit  Against these idiots  That are trying to squeeze  Every penny out 
[02:09:00]  Just let it sit there  The New York City  Transit  You have to repeat that last sentence.  I actually did not hear it.  I'm sorry.  There's a problem.  The New York Post reports that the shuttle was running without a conductor, but New York City Transit insisted it had nothing to do with the accident.  Yeah.  I hope everyone on the train gets together and files a class auction suit.  Against these idiots, they're trying to squeeze every penny out of the New York Transit system by taking away all man colors. 
[02:09:30]  You would think a black person would know the difference between auction and action.  Yeah.  Well, what are you going to do?  Let's action her off.  Right.  How was your ride on the train?  I don't know.  They made me show my teeth and spin around in a circle.  Jesus.  Okay, rinse and spit.  You're doing good, though.  It's getting there.  All right, how many more stories we got?  Forty. 
[02:10:00]  A couple.  All right, a couple.  That's good.  And she's going to read the funny pages for the kids.  Yeah, for the kids.  Yeah, sure.  New York Stock Exchange executives cowered before animal rights activists who vowed angry protests over plants to market shares of a company called Life Science Research Incorporated.  Now the financial report.  Yeah. 
[02:10:30]  Life Science Research Incorporated tests the safety effectiveness of products developed by drug and pharmaceuticals, veterinary, agriculture, and chemical companies.  This is the third story?  Yeah.  I believe so.  It went from the hurricane to this?  Yeah.  Because this doesn't seem like one of those stories anyone would really care about.  Yeah, I watched the news all morning and not one of them covered this one.  No.  Do you have an interesting angle on it and that's why you chose it? 
[02:11:00]  Hopefully.  Ah, that must be it.  She's about to go into one of her tirades.  Right.  Look, fuckers.  Suck the ass.  Well, here's the twist.  All right.  All right.  Here we go.  Swervus.  Supposedly, war, when animal rights, charges that LSR's testing methods are cruel and ineffective  and that company workers have been punching dogs in the face and cutting animals without anesthesia. 
[02:11:30]  Your sister.  Now she's pissed.  Sorry.  First of all, this is what I have to say to you animal activists out there.  Hold on, everybody.  Buckle up.  Go fuck yourself.  If you don't like testing on animals, donate your kids to these companies and let them be  used as guinea pigs. 
[02:12:00]  This is a lot like the Pamela Anderson versus KFC nonsense.  Animals are not people.  If God didn't want us to eat them or torture them, he would have made them so damn tasty.  He would have given them a brain so they can think.  So until these animals get a lawyer and get on a witness stand and say that they don't like  the way they're being treated, I say fuck them.  You know, this was the same thing they said about your people until 1958. 
[02:12:30]  It was the southern debate.  I'm shocked you're siding with KFC.  Wow.  I understand, like, animal testing, but why punch them in the face?  That's really going out of your way.  That's so they can test makeup, I think.  You know how they test it on the rabbits?  That's right.  They put some eye shadow and then they punch them in the face and see if it smudges.  Let's see if this will work on Italian girls.  Here we go.  You can still go to church on Sunday. 
[02:13:00]  No, you punch the animal and then it applies the makeup and puts on sunglasses and tells  the other animals it fell.  Oh, I'm fine.  I'm so clumsy.  I walked into the doggy door.  I was hopping.  I just hit the door.  I don't know what happened.  Plus, he's been under so much stress.  Why aren't you laughing, Francine?  That's a material you just heard.  She doesn't understand.  I didn't get it.  Yeah. 
[02:13:30]  I didn't get it.  Yeah.  I didn't get it.  Making her way out of the carpet-munching warehouse into daytime television is entrepreneur  Martha Stewart, who's made a tremendous comeback.  Her syndicated talk show titled Martha will premiere on Monday, September 12th.  It will have Marsha Cross as a first guest who plays Brie Van de Kamp on the ever-so popular 
[02:14:00]  television show, Desperate House Wars.  Oh, I like your little twist there.  That is clever.  That's how I may ever soak up.  Oh, clever.  MSMBC.com writes that there's no word yet on what Cross will be doing in this premiere  episode.  Well, I have an idea, Martha.  Uh-oh.  If you want to have Oprah running for her money, get an exotic, hung Brazilian guy on the show 
[02:14:30]  and get Marsha Cross to suck his cock.  Call it keeping your husband away from the secretary, sucking cop 101.  That surely will make a splash all over Marsha's face and on daytime television ratings.  Wow.  Mmm.  Interesting take.  Let's see if Martha takes that advice.  All right.  Before we do the next story, just spit the marbles in my hand.  Spit it out. 
[02:15:00]  Let's do point-counterpoint.  Ready?  I'm a thing, but you're a bit wrong.  You use your tongue, Bertier, in a $20 hole.  You know, by the way, I just got to say the one, I think the thing that's impressed me  so much about Michael Rappaport, he's a true New Yorker through and through, the son of a  radio program, man.  That's it, huh?  Cuts off.  That's it?  It cuts off.  Yeah, not that we've mentioned this 5,000 times.  No, we haven't.  I've never heard you mention it.  All right.  Frank and Philly, go ahead real fast.  Yo, what's up, fellas? 
[02:15:30]  Little Jimmy.  Hi.  I want to ask Francine what the capital of Africa is.  Oh, that's a good question.  Capital of Africa.  That's a good question.  That's a very good question.  I believe that would be South Africa.  Oh, very good.  Wow.  That's right.  All right, thank you.  Four years of college, I didn't even know that.  All right, let's say hi to Ben's raw ass.  Ben's raw ass?  Hey, guys.  I just want to say that Francine's so illiterate and so black. 
[02:16:00]  All right, it's Wolf Blitzer.  1-1-9-6-1.  All right, there you go.  That was not very nice.  I didn't care for that type of talk either.  I think you're doing great.  Thank you.  Are you done?  You're not so black.  I have, like, one more story.  All right, last story from Francine.  This is going to be on the lighter side of the news.  This is where we're going.  The human interest story.  I'm standing in Washington Heights with a toddler.  This is the entertainment. 
[02:16:30]  The Daily News reports that a certain pissed off photographer  went out and ranting, seriously dissing the Simpsons sisters  Jessica and Ashley.  37-year-old photographer David LaChapelle  went on record saying that there are everything that's wrong with music,  there are everything wrong with culture, 
[02:17:00]  and everything wrong with art,  and what you think is art and music culture in one family.  Who is he saying this about?  Jessica and Ashley Simpson.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, he said they're reality red carpet lip-syncing television stars.  I don't know what they are beyond that.  Well, first off, let's take Ashley Simpson out of the picture.  Because she, like Haley Duff, Nikki Hilton, and Solange Knowles, 
[02:17:30]  are part of the Rat Pack, I like to call the heinous Hollywood sisters,  who insist on camera time despite the fact that they have no talent,  limited beauty, and no personality.  Jessica Simpson is a pop star who was overshadowed by Britney Spears  and Christina Aguilera, and she didn't get the shine back then,  so she's getting it now. 
[02:18:00]  So would everyone please stop bitching and let her have her 15 minutes.  Wow, your story's going longer than the music.  I know, that's not a good sign.  It never happens.  Patty's just fascinated.  That's where she gets all her news.  Yeah, I find it fascinating, thrilling.  Can I point out, too, to David LaChapelle,  this fucking faggot attacking the Simpson sisters  like they're the only problem in entertainment.  That's a real weak target to go after.  What about the fact that rappers are kind of threatening to shoot each other  during the VMA's live, douchebag.  Fuck, they attack the Simpson sisters. 
[02:18:30]  Fucking pussy.  Jimmy's stealing your thunder.  No, no, I didn't mean to.  I totally agree, Jimmy.  He's editorializing.  He's a soft, weak target he goes after.  Fuckhead.  No one attacks the rappers.  Go ahead, Francine, attack them.  What rapper do you hate?  I don't hate any of them actually.  Yeah, they?  I don't care if they shoot, so it doesn't bother me.  I actually, I like them,  but I'm not attacking the Simpson sisters like,  that's what's wrong with them here.  Yeah, yeah.  What rapper do I hate?  Jam Master Jay.  Yeah.  Oh, you get that one, Francine? 
[02:19:00]  He's dead.  That's right.  I don't like Biggie, and I don't like Tupac.  Oh, that probably still gets you killed.  I think they're dead both, though.  I know, the Tupac thing, for sure.  All right, Francine, I guess we're done with you.  Vanilla Ice I like.  Yeah.  Well, I got one short story.  Oh, I love that.  It's one line.  One line?  Okay.  That's going to take an hour.  All right, one line.  Here we go, Francine.  Congratulations to Andre Agassi,  who beat tennis newcomer and favorite Cinderella man, 
[02:19:30]  James Blake.  And the Patriots beat Raiders 30-20.  Sports.  That's it.  That's it.  That's good.  Bravo.  Thank you.  That was a fine job.  Very good.  You're a reader.  You're a reader now.  You can read.  Oh, my God.  We got to regroup.  I got to think a little trouble. 
[02:20:00]  All right, we got a big guest coming in soon, right?  What time?  According to Ben, he's coming in at 1054.  Around 10 o'clock.  Hey, can I bring us back in on the next break?  Because I never get to do that.  Yeah, you can do that.  All right.  I want to show my radio chops.  You do that.  And we got the Fez audio still.  And you guys got to do interviews live on our show.  Yeah, I guess.  They're going to test the feet as we go to break here.  All right, good.  What kind of a show are you guys putting on here today?  Cancel all avoidments. 
[02:20:30]  Welcome to Radio 3 America.  America's ready.  I'm ready.  I want a million voices crying out in the wilderness.  Jesus, let's get serious.  Now, take a deep cleansing breath.  And begin.  Fix it, fix it.  Guess who's back?  I'm over here now.  Back again.  Nice head, dick.  Back.  Bag it. 
[02:21:00]  Guess who's back?  Oh, man.  Back again.  I don't believe it.  You're so stupid.  You're so stupid.  Guess who's back?  Guess who's back?  Back.  Back again.  Guess who's back?  Tell my friends.  Turn it off.  Hey!  Guess who's back?  Guess who's back?  Guess who's back?  Turn it off?  Yeah.  Guess who's back?  Guess who's back?  Shhh.  Oh, man.  If I was older, I would totally start jacking up right now. 
[02:21:30]  What?  What's all doing?  We're going to have a problem here.  This looks like a job for me.  So, everybody, just follow me.  Because we need a little open answer today.  Because it feels so empty without me.  I'm saying, this looks like a job for me.  So, everybody, just follow me.  Because we need a little open answer today.  Because it feels so empty without me.  Okay, cut.  All right, here we go.  Hold your ears, folks.  It's showtime.  The Boobie and Anthony Show. 
[02:22:00]  This whole wide world I've traveled.  I've seen the tears of other men.  The secrets I've unraveled.  The name I am I am today.  I know, I know.  Can you hear me?  Oh.  Can you hear me now? 
[02:22:30]  Testing, testing, one, two.  Can you hear me?  Oh.  Can you hear me now?  Testing, testing, one, two.  Can you hear me?  Oh.  Can you hear me now?  Testing, testing, one, two.  Can you hear me now?  Oh, can you hear me now?  Testing, testing, one, two. 
[02:23:00]  Can you hear me now?  Oh, can you hear me now?  Testing, testing, one, two.  Are we on?  No?  I can't hear anything.  I can hear you.  Really?  I can't hear it.  I can hear the thing repeating.  All right, I'm sorry.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony program.  They're trying to set up something.  Ron and Fez are in studio.  They're starting on 202 Monday, right after our program.  And they've got to do some interviews with some other XM channels today.  We wanted to kind of do it live on the show.  So they're trying to figure that out. 
[02:23:30]  I'll bring it back to the next one because that was a bit of a technical glitch,  which shouldn't spoil my intro.  Yeah, because you wanted to bring us back from break.  I know.  They played the rejoiner I wanted and everything.  Oh, really?  That was going to be your special rejoiner?  Yeah, I wanted the geezer butler I wanted.  It's one of my favorite songs.  And everything got messed up because of the whole technical thing.  It's all right.  That's what you need on your phone.  Bless you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  You know, they say your heart stops for a second.  I've heard that, too.  Wow.  And somebody once told me that a sneeze, and this is the truth, 
[02:24:00]  that the droplets come out with the force of a hurricane.  Oh.  And they told me that, and I said, really?  And then I spit in their face.  Who cares?  All right, Ron and Fez, you guys are doing something later today, right?  Oh, yeah.  We've got a big party coming up.  Big welcome back party.  BB King's Times Square starts at 5.30, free beer.  Sell it like you love it, Fez.  Sell it like it's a good thing.  It is free beer.  And that is a very good thing.  Of course it is.  Times Square starting at 5.30.  5.30 to 7.30 tonight.  BB King's, 5.30 to 7.30. 
[02:24:30]  Opie's going to be there, Anthony.  And it's a Jimmy birthday bash, so we're all excited about that.  And we do these, are we basically going to do this?  Why don't you guys just play the parts of Ron and Fez?  Oh, wow.  And see if you can get over on some of these.  That sounds like too much work.  Or if you're more well-known.  Is it more like, let's just listen to those guys sell themselves out?  That's exactly it.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It's going to be fun to listen to.  That's it.  I want Francine back.  So you're going to do interviews with, I think, one of our favorite guys at XM, Bruce Kelly. 
[02:25:00]  Bruce Kelly.  Who runs the 80s channel.  Uh-oh.  And you're going to the 60s and 70s channel, too?  I'm absolutely crying over here.  60s and 70s, and then Squiz.  Squiz.  Squiz, of course.  Four of them.  Big supporters over there.  Yeah.  Yeah, the guys at Squiz are all right.  They're all right.  Well, we got the Fez breaking down audio.  Sure.  I want to set this up again, because we were talking about this about an hour ago.  Well, Fez was drinking.  It was your birthday, right?  It was actually my birthday.  And he was drinking on the air, and it was all fun. 
[02:25:30]  Fez is normally happy, happy drunk.  And just as we get to the end, I forget what you were even drinking.  Seven and sevens.  Yeah.  My party drink.  Yeah.  So, yeah, because a well drink means I'm celebrating.  So, as the night goes along, his friend, Mikey D, called up.  And Fez and him had been fighting, and all kinds of mean things had been going back and  forth between them. 
[02:26:00]  Yeah, I was just going through a lot.  We were trying to get the XM deal done.  My grandmother had died that week.  I had just gotten back to D.C. to do the show.  And this guy was insisting on coming to D.C. for the party.  He wanted to stay at my house.  You know, and it was just everything that I didn't need right then and there.  And I had told him, through Ronnie, please, it's not a good time.  Don't show up.  Don't keep pushing this.  And he kept pushing, and it was a night when I was very, very drunk. 
[02:26:30]  And I did.  He was the last person I wanted to hear from at this moment.  Why did he get a hotel, by the way?  Why did he get a hotel?  Because I think their relationship is more special than that.  He was on the Stalker Patty couch.  Oh, I have no idea.  Oh, wow.  I'm just guessing, because I don't really know.  Gee.  All right, well, we've got three tracks here.  The first one is Fez beginning to crack.  This is going to be very uncomfortable, actually.  Of course it is.  Let's just stare at him while it's happening.  Oh, I won't be able to look. 
[02:27:00]  I'll be covering my eyes through this.  And by the way, I've heard this.  If I start jerking off halfway through it, ignore it.  I always do.  Here's Fez beginning to crack.  And Mikey, I swear to you in heaven,  you never cut me slack once during this month.  That has probably been the worst month of my life.  You never cut me slack once.  That's terrific. 
[02:27:30]  Okay, Fez.  That's terrific.  Why don't we do this?  Because a lot of this...  I love Ronnie going in there.  Ronnie trying.  I don't remember the laughing.  Because you guys have been working together.  How long now, Ron?  A long time.  A long time.  And we've known each other for over 20 years.  Wow.  I hear it in your voice like,  Oh, wow.  This is a little different than I'm used to.  Yeah, it's gone too far.  And we were almost done with the show.  It was like we had 15 minutes left in the show.  Oh, you almost eked it out.  Almost made it.  And you know,  a lot of times I think cops even know this, 
[02:28:00]  that you try to slow your energy down  with the crazy person.  Right.  In hopes that that kind of brings them down.  And I know,  you know,  not only...  You try to slow your energy down.  What the hell was that?  Look at that.  That was weird.  It was like instant...  They're still...  They're still...  They're still testing feeds.  Yeah,  because we're going to do some interviews  on other channels.  It's worth saying something  and then having to come right back at you.  That was bizarre.  I thought I was back on the antidepressant.  I've never had that happen before.  I was hoping I just had psychic ability  and I knew what Ron was going to say. 
[02:28:30]  It would be great.  It would be great.  You'd have a new closer.  I finally discovered that you got it.  Yeah.  All right.  So you have to pop in here  because you're like,  this is not good.  Well,  I want to get them.  I think I want to save  the Ron and Fez franchise here.  Right.  And I kind of just want to get them...  Low energy.  And not only that,  but we literally...  All these people showed up.  We had a packed studio  with people with presents for Fez  and people who really loved him  and I didn't want him to be seen like that 
[02:29:00]  in front of people.  I know he was that drunk.  All right.  Why don't we do this?  Because a lot of this,  I know you've had a lot of stress.  And this has been the worst month of my life.  I know, buddy.  And somehow,  you never want to say,  I know, buddy.  I know, buddy.  I had an uncomfortable.  I know, buddy.  I know, buddy.  I'm kind of being nice  at the same time  it was me who slid the Tom Waits.  And so it's really...  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Of course. 
[02:29:30]  I was wondering where the music came from.  It's even sounding worse.  Yeah.  So, I mean,  it's the terrible thing that you do  when you do this job.  Yeah, I know, buddy.  That's like hand in hand  with the backpack.  I think I was.  Why are you patting his back?  I think I was doing some of that.  That's perfect.  I remember.  And I was totally weird  out that he was this upset  over his 99-year-old grandmother dying.  I'm thinking,  what's going to happen  when he gets an unexpected death?  I guess there hasn't been  a lot of death in your life.  No.  No, that was like 
[02:30:00]  one of the few funerals  I had ever been to.  I think maybe two in my life.  He even freezes his sperm.  He's that religious that...  I hate to see anything die.  Yeah, he doesn't want anything  to happen to those tadpoles.  He actually jacks into a freezer.  And I think all the southern Christians  do that.  Yeah, sure.  Can't get the door open on it now.  I know, buddy.  Oh, my gosh.  I know.  He's so pissed, so sad, and so drunk  all at the same time.  I'm giving him that.  I'm as mad as you are.  I pray I never have to say that 
[02:30:30]  to Jim Norton or Anthony.  I know, buddy.  I would be awful.  Right, it's just so awful.  I thought it was a girl!  It was a wig!  I know, buddy.  We understand.  It's okay.  I'll tell you how bad  the night got, though.  I had to take him home  and throw the mattress down  in front of the toilet  and make sure that he slept  on his stomach.  You know, he was that aft up,  so I didn't really even sleep 
[02:31:00]  that night because he could  have easily, you know...  Were you puking?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, it didn't stop from there.  Once we went off the air,  it didn't stop.  When did you start puking?  When I got to Ronnie's house.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  After I punched him  in the stomach.  What happened?  Let's get back to the audio here.  The worst month of my life.  I know, buddy.  And somehow,  through some irony of God,  through some joke  that he finds funny,  that the Supreme Green 
[02:31:30]  finds it funny,  my birthday ends up  at the end of this month  that I have had  the most brutal time of.  I think God was sitting there  with the joke book.  I'm supposed to sit here  and do...  What kind of joke?  To defend God,  my birthday was always  at the end of that month.  Right.  It wasn't like he just  changed it that day.  And, you know,  I think after six,  you should stop making  a big deal about your birthday,  like that should be  a special day.  Right.  I'm having a party.  Yeah. 
[02:32:00]  I disagree with Ronald.  Yeah, I think it should be  a special day.  I think it should make it  to leave date.  Every day.  That's the free main being.  I think a man  should just ignore it.  Here we go.  I'm supposed to sit here  and take, you know,  and drink  and have a great time  and, you know,  act like nothing's happened  whatsoever.  I know, buddy.  Here's what you're saying.  I have been brutalized  through this month  and you never,  ever got me  one ounce of slack. 
[02:32:30]  Not once  did you ever say,  hey, I'm here for you.  It was always,  hey, I'm here for me.  I just want him to stop.  You'll find out  that slack becomes  the key word in this.  Of course it does.  Okay, yeah.  That's why we're going to  Can someone yank us  off the air right now?  Okay, buddy.  I know, I know, buddy.  Okay.  Now, you tried that moving on 
[02:33:00]  little lilt to your voice  and it wasn't working.  Right about then,  you're thinking,  well, I always thought  about doing the show  by myself.  All right, buddy.  Okay.  Also, Fezzy.  And this was...  Go ahead, Ronnie.  I just want you to know.  Go ahead, Ronnie.  Also, Fezzy.  Take a breath.  I've got to hear that again.  Go ahead, Ronnie.  Also, Fezzy.  And this was...  Go ahead, Ronnie.  I just want you to know  that no matter what,  a lot of this  is because you're drinking 
[02:33:30]  and you have  had a hard month.  And I just want you to...  It's been the most brutal  month of my life.  I know it has, buddy.  And no one knows  what I've been through.  I know, pal.  Yeah.  None of us have ever  lost a grandmother.  You're the first one  to ever had a grandmother die.  It's all shock to the rest of us.  I don't mean openly  laughing at you,  but this is great stuff.  This is so unique.  Oh.  It's so sad.  She's 90...  When someone 99 dies, 
[02:34:00]  it's a relief.  How old was she?  99.  Well, that's why  they wanted the big  100th birthday party.  Smuckers.  We wanted the  Willard Scott moment.  Yeah.  I got to have that moment  with my great-aunt last year.  Really?  She turned 100.  Was she on the  Willard Scott 100 years young?  No, she's too young  for that crap.  Yeah?  She still lives alone  in all sorts.  She's one of those ones  that, yeah.  She's self-sufficient.  At 100?  No problem.  Yeah, no problem.  Wow.  She's going to be  101 in a week.  Jesus.  Wow.  She's still doing it.  Wow.  They celebrated her birthday  at a Mets game 
[02:34:30]  and she was there  rocking.  God bless.  No wheelchairs.  If anything happens  to her, don't tell Fez,  please.  I don't want to know.  No.  He will run down  57th Street.  We had a great  100th birthday party,  though.  It was awesome.  They always aren't fun.  They're so special.  She got to dance  with all her children,  her grandkids,  her great-grandkids.  I believe even some  of the great-great-grandkids  got to dance with her.  It was a very special moment.  Everything we were hoping for.  The 99th,  is special, too.  He has my bottle.  No, it's not. 
[02:35:00]  It means nothing.  That's plenty.  It's really plenty.  Really.  66 upside down.  Who doesn't like that?  Right.  Where's the calendar  with the countdown  down to 100?  Does someone have that option?  Oh, the option.  Oh.  Was it penciled in?  Oh, yeah.  Circled with an exclamation point.  How soon?  Yeah, how close did she get?  How close?  Like 100 days to go?  A month.  Oh.  Seriously.  Oh, she died March 23rd. 
[02:35:30]  Her birthday was April 22nd.  Oh, wow.  That's terrific.  You know he's emotional.  That's my bottle.  I'm going to have to drink a lot  tonight at B.B. King's.  Wow.  Oh, what's going on at B.B. King's?  Oh, we're having a welcome back party.  Ooh.  Yes.  Are we invited?  At 5.30, you're invited.  Definitely be there.  All right, nice.  And Jimmy will say goodbye to you.  I will be there.  Okay.  Track two.  Fez very drunk and emotional  about passing grandma. 
[02:36:00]  This is very sad.  It continues.  It's been absolutely insane.  I had to sit there  and watch  and get a call every day  that my grandmother  was passing away.  Oh, boy.  And you know what, Fezzy?  She held...  No, you let me talk.  I'm sorry.  Please.  I'm sorry.  She held on 
[02:36:30]  through every day  this month.  Oh.  And I had to deal with it every day.  Every day.  I got a call  saying this was the last day.  Ronnie, you know that.  I know that, man.  Ronnie's just like that.  Yeah, do I know it?  I feel the worst for Ronnie  in this whole thing.  Well, I mean,  it's not like... 
[02:37:00]  Hey, grandma.  It wasn't like  this hasn't happened  on the phone,  you know,  I mean,  for like weeks and all.  I'm sure.  Every day.  I swear,  my family would call  all through that month  and they'd go,  this is it.  The nursing home  says this is it.  It's going to be  any minute now.  You had to deal with this  every day.  Yeah, and she like  went into her coma  the same time  Terry Schiavo  was getting her  feeding tooth pulled.  And where was Congress?  Yeah, right.  No one.  For grandma.  No one.  Wow.  All that was there  was that black orderly.  Get one last. 
[02:37:30]  He was nice.  Get one last one.  All right.  We have the final track.  Fez had to leave.  You had to leave  your family?  You talk about that?  Oh, yeah.  He left the funeral  to come back to D.C.  So that kind of...  To do the show.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So I'd just gotten back.  Dedication.  Yeah.  To the program.  Now, how much time  did you guys have  left on JFK  when this was happening?  We were already  in that, you know,  where Bob was doing  the same thing to us.  Like, I think it's  any minute now, boys. 
[02:38:00]  You are going to love it.  Awesome.  Oh, Opie and Anthony  are loving it  like no time before.  And, you know,  they'd already given us  XM radios  and the contract  was already done  and then, you know,  we're in hell  and then I would get up  and turn you guys on  in the morning  and I'm just, you know,  hearing you guys  having a ball  and it's like...  Oh, no.  It's like being like  on Rikers Island.  But then a party bus  goes by  with all your friends  in it.  You know,  some party yacht  is out there  with chicks and all  and you're just  looking out the window. 
[02:38:30]  Oh, is that horrible?  I think we lost her.  I think she's...  I think that's  the last breath.  You see your show  just self-destruct.  Oh, yeah.  Everything.  Everything's fucked.  You got, like,  a week left in prison  and your buddy's  ready to hang himself.  When the phone would ring,  it was either Bob  or someone reporting  on Grandma.  That was it.  If I could tell  the one story  that I never told before  that one night  that I took the quick break  and you left...  Oh, yeah.  ...when he was going 
[02:39:00]  through a lot of his anxiety,  he decides during the show  that he's having  a heart attack.  Right.  So, he's locking up.  The legs won't move.  Oh, no.  I throw it to a break  and, like,  this is it.  I'm gone.  So, I have to call 911.  Oh, man.  And, luckily...  It was a mess.  During the...  I don't need to laugh.  I'm sorry.  You know, the Viacom  18 minutes of commercials...  Saved his life.  Yeah.  The fucking thing comes up,  pulls him out. 
[02:39:30]  You know, the empties come in.  They rush him off.  They're shaving my chest.  Yeah.  And, I go back.  I finish the show.  Wait, this is real?  Yeah.  This all actually happened.  So, they finish the show.  I go there.  You know, I rush over  and they're like,  you know, he's healthy  as a fat horse.  There's nothing wrong with him.  This is in his fucking head.  Right?  I couldn't breathe.  The room was spinning.  So, then I have to walk back 
[02:40:00]  into the shame of someone  thinking they're sick  but they're just nervous.  And, I'm just nervous.  Very nervous.  They kept me at the nervous hospital.  Don't be turning around  and look at me.  At the nervous hospital.  Fez gets scared.  I'm in there.  I'm in there talking to him  and he's like,  I can't believe this.  He goes,  I don't know what I'm fucking doing anymore. 
[02:40:30]  And, I go,  he goes,  this is so embarrassing.  And, I'm going,  Fez,  this is, you know.  I know, buddy.  Yeah, right.  I'm going,  nobody knows that this happened.  I didn't even say it on the air.  We thought to break.  You know,  the producer will keep it quiet.  And, then all of a sudden,  I hear this.  The curtain opens up  and the guy next to us goes,  Are you guys running, Fez?  Oh, no.  I heard your voices.  Love you.  What's wrong with you, Fez?  I got the oxygen up my nose. 
[02:41:00]  And, nothing is wrong with him.  There's not a fucking thing  wrong with him.  I just couldn't function.  You just can't keep it together.  Your nerves were shot.  It was done.  All right, with that said,  why don't we go to track three here?  Oh, jeez.  He gets nervous.  Fez had to leave his family  to come back to do the radio show  shortly after your grandma's funeral.  Yeah, right after.  Just so everyone knows,  I'm the first one in my family  to move away.  Right. 
[02:41:30]  Everyone else in my family  is there in Panamalas Park, Florida.  Everyone else was there.  You live in the gayest town  I've ever heard.  What is it called?  Panamalas Park, Florida.  Yeah, it's...  Panamalas Park?  Yeah, it's right next to Bumfuck.  Why'd they put the L in there  and wreck the whole...  Everyone else was there  with my grandmother 
[02:42:00]  when it was time to happen.  But my father retired tonight  after all his years of work  and I couldn't be there.  You know?  Right.  And it's not easy  to be the one that's not there.  And for someone else to come along  and just accuse me of forgetting, 
[02:42:30]  forgetting his birthday,  of someone else to accuse me  of, like, being selfish  with my feelings,  it's absolutely more  than I could take  because there's nothing  more in the world.  When I had the...  My grandmother got married  on Monday.  Buried.  Married.  I stayed there.  I flew back to Washington, D.C.  on Tuesday.  You know, here's the thing. 
[02:43:00]  My grandmother,  almost 90 years old.  That's cool.  I said goodbye to her.  You know, I say...  You know, I...  We settle things.  We settle things.  I owed her money.  There was a problem.  Settle things.  Today we settle all family business.  Someone shot her  walking through a revolving door.  The beauty part of this  and the thing that I'm going  to admit today  is that I'm stealing  this money from XM. 
[02:43:30]  I know that this show  is frayed  and so far beyond its prime.  It doesn't stand a chance.  And I thought  if I could make it  to one last payday.  Maybe I can get the kids  through school.  I've got to be honest,  Charlie Cheswick  handled the cigarette crisis better.  I want my cigarette!  Piss on your fucking loads!  Basically, you're who he is.  What gives you the right  to keep our cigarettes 
[02:44:00]  piled on your desk  like cookies?  And then I have to watch him  be drugged down the hall  to get fucking shock treatment.  Why am I just sitting there?  Are you going to say  goodbye to me, Ron?  Settle down, Charles.  It was a bad time.  Is it over?  Is it fucking over?  Because to me  it doesn't feel like it.  Almost.  Less than a minute ago.  Settle things.  But I had to leave  my family  when they were  at their absolute weakest. 
[02:44:30]  They had already  lost someone  and then I had to  look them in the eye  and say,  Well, I'm off  to D.C.  Did you say it like that,  Fezzy?  Well, I'm off.  Did you have on  a straw hat  and a suitcase  in each hand?  My raccoon coat.  Why did you make it  feel like the second loss  that your family  had to sustain?  You're alive.  I'm leaving Smallville.  I'm leaving Smallville.  Not only a death,  but my whining 
[02:45:00]  won't be here either.  There's nothing wrong  with a 40-year-old man  moving out of the house.  Fucking inbreds  act like everybody  should live  under the same tin roof  down there in Florida.  Oh, cozy.  I'm off to D.C.  Wow.  Mr. Wally goes to Washington.  Gets into the old train  with the old locomotive.  This is embarrassing.  Dude, dude.  All aboard.  The whole town  of Pinellas Park  comes out  with a brass band 
[02:45:30]  that's  saying goodbye to them.  Da-da-da-da.  Da-da-da-da-da.  It was like  when Doc Hollywood  was leaving  when the whole town  they'd bring my pig  here to fuck on the train.  Alright, here's  the last 30 seconds.  Please.  Brad, well...  All of that  is on my conscience.  I know, buddy.  And for someone  to...  You know,  for someone  to make me feel guilty  about what's going on 
[02:46:00]  on my birthday  when, trust me,  is this the place  I want to be?  Is this the place  I should be?  Probably not.  It's just disgusting.  It's just disgusting.  Disgusting.  Then he just said  fuck you to the whole town.  Yeah.  Yeah, this went on  all night, by the way.  That's just some excerpts.  Yeah, it was just...  It was...  You know, the weirdest thing  is that people  were standing there 
[02:46:30]  and some guy who...  He's like a friend  of the show.  He's a hypnotist.  He had just come  walking in with an ice cream  cake for Fez.  Oh, no.  As the tirade starts  and he just stands there  shocked.  He has no idea  what is going on  and I watch  as the ice cream cake  slowly melts.  I didn't get any.  And the man doesn't move  a muscle  just watching  a slow train wreck.  That's...  Wow.  How symbolic.  Yeah.  Watching the one  strong, firm cake 
[02:47:00]  melting into a puddle  of mush.  I think I'm back  on track now.  You think you're okay now?  Yeah.  Off the drugs.  How much did you  drink that night?  He had a glass of wine.  It was a glass?  A little glass of wine  and a spritzer?  Yeah, a little.  Because you really  sounded annihilated.  Yeah.  And it was all fun  up until then.  All fun.  Holding it back.  Well, you used to be  the funnest drunk.  The tears of a clown 
[02:47:30]  is what that was.  Now it all happens  every time.  Let's say hi to Pete  in New York.  Pete, what's up?  Hey, how you guys doing?  Ron and Fez.  I'm glad to hear you  guys back on here.  But anyway,  I wanted to know  if you're going to  play that clip  where Ronnie gets  angry in the air.  I love that clip  because you just blast.  I don't know  how you play it.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That was a great clip.  You guys should play  that right now.  Some program management?  Yeah, this is...  As we drive past Fezzy,  you'll see his smiling face.  But as you can see,  this is what we call  a facade.  It's a false front. 
[02:48:00]  As we drive around  the back,  yeah, there's a hysterical  man crying.  There's a wave  of depression.  He went through  a rough time.  Yeah.  He wanted to leave.  That sounds like  a lot of pressure  for one month.  A lot of stuff  crammed into a month.  Ed had been building  over the past two years.  The job was a problem.  Your grandmother died  and it seemed like  you were breaking up  with your boyfriend,  Mikey D.  That I didn't understand  it all.  All right, Jeff, Iowa.  What's up? 
[02:48:30]  All right, we lost him.  Okay.  Have to look people  in the eye and say,  I'm off to D.C.  That's going to be rough.  Yeah.  That's a tough day.  In Florida, yes.  All right,  the Opie and Anthony auction.  The second phase  has begun.  Eric has been busy  all morning long  putting up new items,  Anthony.  And Opie and Anthony,  well, actually,  the Jim Norton Scarface shirt  that you got for your birthday.  $1,500.  It's up to $140, Jimmy.  It's the bright red one  you got for your birthday  from your mom, right? 
[02:49:00]  My parents.  Intern for a day  is up to $1,000,  more or less.  The Brian Regan  Cup of Dirt,  autographed by Brian Regan,  $305 already.  Wow.  Unless it's autographed.  Isn't it just a cup of dirt?  Yeah.  Good point, Anthony.  The Brian Regan Cup of Dirt.  That's not autographed.  Opie and Anthony,  the Brian Regan Pop-Tarts  autographed by...  Oh, how's that going?  $37.  They're pop-tarts.  Wow shirts are up here,  all sorts of stuff.  Let's see what else.  The Inappropriate Bell, 
[02:49:30]  $128.  Oh, no.  What's going to happen?  Yeah, we're auctioning it off.  Oh, no.  Nothing inappropriate  can happen on the show now anymore.  What are we going to use?  And the Starker Patty wig  is up to $50,  just under $50,  it looks like.  If I was the hard rock,  I'd buy that one.  That would be perfect  for the hard rock.  Wouldn't it?  Yeah.  Hang that up,  a little memorabilia.  Wait, new items are up here now.  It was taken in front of it.  The Joey Paisano shirt,  autographed, $55.  And a lot of stuff for a penny. 
[02:50:00]  Wow hats, autographed.  They just made the list.  All right.  Those are cheap items  for people that just want to give,  but not so much.  Right, a penny.  Yeah.  All right.  Can you say fuck on this channel?  Oh, Jesus.  That's shocking.  Holy fuck, I need coffee.  This is the best show ever.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Are we back on the air?  Let me know we're back on the air. 
[02:50:30]  You're on the air, moron.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Radio Program.  We're here doing this show at 10 o'clock.  A lot of topics to cover.  You've got to set the table.  All right.  We've got some guys in here.  And we're talking some stuff.  Got a big party tonight.  And that was an Ozzy Osbourne song.  And the big party tonight, 5.30 p.m. here in the Big Apple, as I call it. 
[02:51:00]  The Ron and Fez Welcome Back Party at the Hard Rock Cafe.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  B.B. King.  Oh, B.B. King.  In Times Square.  Sorry.  5.30.  I forgot the old diabetic black gentleman.  Could be the worst plug ever.  Oh, no.  How's it going?  The Ron and Fez Party.  Free beer.  We're all going.  Free beer.  Is it open more?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  XM's buying the beer.  Nice.  Sidecar Kenny will be there.  I think we're ready for a spinoff.  I think Jimmy is now ready to take this thing on his own. 
[02:51:30]  A lot of people have been saying that.  When I bring a show back, I know how to do it from break.  It's obvious, yeah.  All right.  We've been having a lot of fun at Ron and Fez's expense, so we're going to turn it around  a little bit here.  Expense?  Yeah.  That hurts.  How much it costs to you, guys?  Seriously, it hurts.  It's sold.  Well, we do a segment on this show every once in a while called Bombs and Flubs.  We did the bombs last week.  This is Bombs and Flubs, Volume 3.  We did not do the flubs yet.  Ah.  No.  The bombs, you've been witness to a couple of them, and you're just sitting here. 
[02:52:00]  You know, you're throwing so many lines out on a daily basis, not all of them are going  to hit their primary target.  You know, some of them hit way off in the woods where no one really notices them.  Right.  That's what happens.  The greatest, though, is when you notice what somebody just did when they bombed, like  before you did the one joke, but then you talked after it.  It was like, sometimes you do that, like you're trying to make it look like it was almost serious,  like, you know, here comes the joke.  Well, but then again, I was trying to say it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The cover.  Because you know, if you're not going to talk, there's just going to be deafening silence 
[02:52:30]  and shame.  The sound of shame.  No one else laughs when they hear cripple.  So you have to.  Right.  You know, of course, they are brave people.  You've got to give them all the benefit in the world for that.  That's definitely true.  I don't think I can do it.  You definitely try to fill up the dead air.  By the way, can I quote somebody?  Someone smashed my face so good, I have to give them credit.  I wasn't even there.  Keith and Bob Kelly were bashing me.  And if somebody doesn't do something, get arrested.  And Keith said I was so mushy, they wouldn't use handcuffs. 
[02:53:00]  They would use garbage bag ties.  Little twist ties.  Oh, that was a real, that was a gem.  All right.  It's Bombs and Flubs, Volume 3.  Here come the flubs.  Who's first?  I am.  Here it is.  If you're going to stand there and try to look cool in your picture, you're not a funny guy, dude.  Yeah.  Wearing sensitive slacks.  His slacks.  But he's telling us how to dress.  Yes, I meant to say sensible instead of sensitive.  Oh, jot that down.  You said sensitive slacks instead of sensible slacks. 
[02:53:30]  Sensitive.  And the beep, so you know we're back live on the air.  That was the Jim Phillips trashing, I think.  Yeah.  Sensitive slacks was a band Fez put together in high school.  A lot of culture club covers.  It's a progressive kind of art school type band.  All right.  The next flub is from Anthony.  Me?  Here we go.  I hate when I flub.  Fucking Hawk is good. 
[02:54:00]  He asked for something, fucking 40 minutes later, this kid runs off with a piece of paper.  Thanks, bro.  Skating over on his...  Nothing.  You want to say something about mayo leaking out of his...  I'm just going to try, yeah.  That's right.  That's a tough one because then you realize he has sneakers on.  Fuck, Brad.  That was a bomb flub.  Yeah.  I was going for a joke.  I couldn't quite...  My mouth started with it before I was done concocting it in my head.  And I threw it out there and just hit a wall. 
[02:54:30]  That was it.  It's the best stuff ever, though.  I don't know why.  It's like watching somebody hit a baseball, but the ball comes down and catches their heel.  You know what I mean?  It's like when you're on a team with a guy, that's when you're laughing the hardest.  When something happens to your friends, it's better than if something happens to your enemy.  I don't know why that is.  Yeah.  All right.  Here's the next flub from Jimmy Norton.  Happy birthday, by the way.  Well, thanks, Opie.  Here we go.  Why did you have to mention that?  Had to because it was a Latino joke.  Is that...  You're afraid you're going to get one letter from one fucking disgruntled person? 
[02:55:00]  Holy shit.  And he probably didn't even realize he was doing it.  Yeah.  Because it's just a natural thing to do now.  This intellectual coward...  Intellectual.  I should have my face...  Intellectual?  He's an intellectual.  What, you go to collage?  All right.  Not too bad.  No, I just...  I was just...  You were going off on a tear there.  I stumbled.  Tripped up a little.  Happens to the best of us.  Flip is not a fault.  Good point, Fez.  Good point.  All right.  Moving on.  Here's another one from myself. 
[02:55:30]  Intellectual Jew Boys.  That's right.  New York City.  Hook nose controlling the media.  Here's the next one.  And there was an actress that was in...  Oh, right.  There was an actress.  No one buts a baby in a corner.  Baby in a corner.  Buts.  That's just...  I can't say put.  Buts.  Sometimes I just can't say put.  But.  So you're going for the dirty dancing.  Right.  And that wasn't enough.  You just take a line out of the movie and act like that's what the movie's called. 
[02:56:00]  Is that movie Jew People Dancing Upstate?  I do that to Fez all the time.  I make him actually be my memory bank.  I have no idea what the name of or anybody else's name.  So I just have to be ready with it.  Even if it's incorrect.  Yeah.  Just to throw out a name.  That's Bill.  Yeah, right.  I do that all the time.  It seems like whenever I'm trying to come up with a name or movie title or anything.  Right.  The second I want to bring it into focus, it goes further away. 
[02:56:30]  Right.  And then I have to use some kind of thing.  And I wonder why people don't know.  The guy that wore the shoes and had the shirt in that movie.  Come on.  Come on.  And then you're an asshole for not knowing.  Come on.  Come on.  All right.  The next one is from Anthony.  Here we go.  And I don't know if they'll show some idiot.  I don't know what happened.  I brought my gas can.  I smoked.  I fell asleep.  Next thing you know, this hotel isn't safe.  Lighting firecrackers in my oxygen tent. 
[02:57:00]  Firecrackers.  Firecrackers.  Yeah.  All right.  Moving right along.  Bombs and Flubs, Volume 3.  The Flubs.  Here's the next one.  I'd do that, actually.  I'd buy flashbacks.  I'd bite the index finger really hard.  No.  No more biting.  And then I'd bite in between my bicep and my shoulder muscle.  Right here in that soft spot.  Where do you bite?  Really hard.  Why would you do that? 
[02:57:30]  All right.  Relax.  No, no.  I'm asking you.  Jesus.  What?  If you bite between your biceps, that is dangerous.  Why?  You can't.  Because a bicep is...  I didn't say bicep.  Did I?  Oh, God.  Well, I'll be the star of Volume 3.  Did I really say that one?  No.  I didn't even catch that one.  Yeah, you did.  All right.  Bicep.  Of course, Danny Dixon caught it.  Was that stupid Steve chiming in?  I really...  It was you, wasn't it? 
[02:58:00]  No, no, but who caught it?  Like, who said, yeah, you did?  Oh, yes, you did.  It was perfect.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  The next flub is from Jimmy Norton.  Hey, what's that?  The fist of the archives for one of these?  Are you writing out your questions?  Yeah, I got a few.  A few written down.  Can you read one of them?  They won't make any sense.  What do you have big spaces?  Is that what I'm going to answer?  I love how confident he is.  They won't make any sense.  He's been preparing all morning.  Just little ideas.  Little ideas.  Oh, my, Jimmy.  Can I suck your hog? 
[02:58:30]  Check this box for Yex.  I'm sorry, Jimmy.  For Yex.  Check this box for Yex.  That was when I was interviewing Sabbath.  That day I was in dumb Boston studio.  You were a little nervous.  Yeah.  I was scared.  I was scared.  Moving on.  A Brooklyn man says his estranged wife forged his signature on a form to get his frozen sperm.  Who did open?  I'm sorry.  I actually did not hear that.  We're back live.  It's always that fuck across from me that has to make sure everyone. 
[02:59:00]  Everyone knows I fucked up.  I tried to ask in a way that doesn't give away that it was a fuck up.  But you're acting.  You're the worst.  That's not really what it is.  That's not really what it is.  That's not really what I'm saying.  That's exactly what it is.  My pal Anthony lets me flub all the time.  That's right.  But you have to point it out every fucking time.  What was that one?  Why don't you repeat what you just said?  All right.  Back to the tape.  To get his frozen sperm.  Who did open?  I'm sorry.  I actually did not hear that. 
[02:59:30]  A Brooklyn man says he's restrained.  Oh, I said the word wrong.  No, no, no.  Look at it, Jimmy.  A Brooklyn man says his wife that he no longer likes forged his signature on a form to get  his frozen sperm and then used it to conceive a daughter.  How long have they been restrained?  I'm not playing your stupid game.  Dude, if I see a G in a word, I just remove it.  Just take it out.  You don't say wait.  No.  So Ant and I.  It's still in there. 
[03:00:00]  I'm going to drag Anthony into this one.  So Ant and I don't talk as well as you, Jimmy.  What can we say?  Why was I dragged into that, by the way?  I knew I needed a little help in the life mode.  I was looking really bad.  I had to drag you in to help me out there.  Everybody gets Francine mouth.  There's nothing going to go about it.  Bombs and Flubs, Volume 3 of The Flubs.  We move on with little Jimmy Norton.  Francine talks like she is always having a stroke.  I just want this. 
[03:00:30]  Yeah, she really does.  Here's Jimmy.  What did he get?  And then it's going to be like, well, there's a long line at Dwayne Reed.  Should I ask him what he got?  Painkiller?  I had to get condoms, and his size is a special-made order only.  Special-made order.  Ah, here she is.  I think the old Ben's hog bit might be done.  Oh, no, there's more.  I just tripped on it.  That was like a bomb flub together.  Yeah.  That was a combination of an awful joke that was delivered horribly.  It was nice. 
[03:01:00]  I think Ben's being a little picky on some of these.  I think so.  I think so.  I think so picky.  You Jew motherfucker!  You ever go over my head again, I'll kill you!  Here's the next flub.  It's an unspoken rule.  You just know it exists.  You know it exists.  But you know what?  Oh, I was so glad I didn't have to go into cheery mode right there.  What happened?  You wrong button-pushing son of a bitch. 
[03:01:30]  You had the, uh...  I'm not feeling too good about myself.  You had the wrong template on, didn't you?  I'm not feeling too good about myself.  Oh, don't let it get you down.  My whole responsibility during that rant was to push one lousy button and I couldn't do it.  You could do it.  It was a mistake.  We all make them.  And we're back live.  Well, I was going to play the comedy music.  The comedy music.  Yeah.  All right.  This is funny.  Sometimes it's almost funny when somebody pushes the wrong button because we all know what it was going for.  Right. 
[03:02:00]  Jim, are you ever sincere, though?  Can we ever, when you try to pick us up, can we ever believe you even for a second?  Sure can.  Because I just, sometimes it seems sarcastic.  I just know that if something's going wrong in my life and you're building me up, it's a joke at my expense.  The rip down.  Yeah, the tear down's right on the corner.  You've got to know when to joke and when to not.  Right.  That's what my dad would always say.  Then he'd say, use your head for something besides a hat rack.  That dad had tough talk.  I think Nathaniel has something against Anthony here because the next three are all Anthony. 
[03:02:30]  What did I do?  Why didn't you spread them around there?  Yeah, Jesus, Ant.  I mean, I, Dan.  Hold on.  Let me read.  That's not really a flub.  That's just like a little, you know, fudge.  Am I on?  Ah, flub time for it.  Ha, ha.  Ah, ha.  You see how that hurts?  How about technical glitches, volume one?  All right, here's Anthony flubbing.  Damn it.  Didn't it get 50,000 views, that one, the first thread?  Yeah.  The one, the first thread, the second one's got like 8,000.  8,000 already.  This guy's in trouble.  He's got a big mouth and he's arrogant and he's going to learn.  Well, I can't wait to hear what happens this afternoon. 
[03:03:00]  It should be interesting.  Wait till we unloosh, unleash, unleash, unleash, unleash.  L-O-U-S-H-E.  It's kind of like douche with an L.  I was going to make a minister of morons jokes and I fucked it all up.  We have finally had it with these guys in commercial radio trying to say that we don't have an audience  and that our radio careers are done.  We finally had it.  We're like, oh yeah, well, watch what we do now.  We'll show you how powerful this radio show actually is.  He's in a lot of trouble, capoosh.  Yeah, I remember. 
[03:03:30]  I think are all three of these from the same day?  Because I was having one of the worst days ever when I said unlooshed.  That sounded like he got up to walk away at one point.  I was so angry at my mouth.  I couldn't say anything that day.  Do you notice every clip is us having a problem with another radio show?  Fuck out and fuck your show!  He's a fucking jerk off.  We are assholes.  And everyone falls for it, huh?  Have you ever attacked anyone and they go, oh no. 
[03:04:00]  No, I'm not going to.  No, a lot of times it's just a response to an unprovoked,  because a lot of these people we haven't heard of until they start talking shit.  Oh, is that right?  Yeah.  All right, here's Anthony.  This one's a great one.  Oh, no.  Okay, I'll ask you a question.  Who's the useless jizz receptacle?  Fuck you.  Look at them all jotting it down inside.  Mark it.  Time it.  There's pens going crazy.  Resleptical.  I think that was the same day.  I'm not sure.  Yeah.  Resleptical. 
[03:04:30]  I stink.  First of all, I don't like the fact that Condoleezza Rice has the same hairstyle as Big Kev.  Really?  It's beginning to annoy me.  I actually thought that was Francine and the president together.  I thought she was announcing she won Patty's wig on the off-camp.  How is that wig?  The wig's over $100, Anthony.  All right.  All right.  Here's the next flub from Anthony again.  Bombs and Flubs, Volume 3.  Mr. Cotta, I'm getting out of my bubble. 
[03:05:00]  And then what happened?  He took a walk.  What happened?  Yeah.  I think that's how it ends, knowing that it's probably not going to turn out too good.  I'll probably turn out too good.  Catch that cold.  Like some dirty Asian sneezed in his face.  Give him the SIDS.  The SIDS?  Or the, what is it called?  Yeah.  Some infant death syndrome.  I didn't know SIDS was contagious.  And you've got to put John to sleep on his back.  What a tool.  I forgot about that. 
[03:05:30]  He did recover.  He recovered, yeah.  Big recover, yes.  That could be the highlight right there of Bombs and Flubs.  I could not talk.  The SIDS.  Yeah, you never know.  And we finish Bombs and Flubs off with, lol, Jimmy Norton.  Maybe you can go to, speaking of drug steers, drug steers.  Drug steers.  Speaking of drug stores.  You want your stuff, go to Dwayne Reed.  That's a fine place to fill a prescription.  If you want to see Jen, Jane, my fucking.  Oh, wow. 
[03:06:00]  Jimmy, have a cup of coffee and just spare us.  I was going to say Jane Goodall in action.  It would have been a Jen, but I said Jen Goodall.  Jen Goodall.  No, her sister.  Georgia!  Please, Georgia!  And that ends Bombs and Flubs Volume 3.  That was like a double.  Yeah, you started off.  I think the initial one tripped you up a little bit.  Yeah.  And then you weren't able to continue.  I want to thank you. 
[03:06:30]  Sometimes it's like you're running.  You ever run down a hill and you're so on the brink of falling right on your face  and you know it's going to happen, but you can't stop?  That's how some of those things are.  You try and your mouth is working, but you know you're just going to end up head over a tea kettle.  Well, you only run downhill if Steve is chasing you.  I don't run well downhill.  You know this.  Oh, he's playing dead.  I have to walk away.  Nathaniel, great job.  Excellent.  Let's go back in the archives. 
[03:07:00]  Did you find anyone from the first few shows?  They're working on it.  I know it's a toy because you don't remember them.  You've got to listen to everyone individually.  All right.  That Nathaniel is kind of intimidating.  He's there at the left-hand side of the father.  It's kind of a...  Yes.  He's there for him at all times like a fucking parrot on Opie's shoulder, just watching around  with everyone.  He's watching, writing.  He's trolling the internet.  He's got a mic now.  He's got his own microphone.  I see him give angry hand signals to the other people. 
[03:07:30]  I'll trade for him.  What do you got for us?  I'll give you Earl.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Harry.  Uh-huh.  And a bag of pot.  That's all we have.  That's all we have.  And I know it doesn't feel like you want...  Wait until later when you really want to smoke a joint.  And then you'll make that move.  What's the matter, Than?  You were going to say something.  Your mic didn't work.  What happened?  Go ahead.  Oh, boy.  Floor's yours.  And...  That's good.  That was good.  This one...  Ah-ha.  Stupid.  Yeah.  All our mics.  I don't know what's going on. 
[03:08:00]  Let's fix these cordless mics.  Let's get them fixed.  Danny?  Let's see what we got going on.  Looking at the auction again here, guys.  Mardi Gras banner autographed by us.  $300.  The second phase has started today.  A lot of new items up on eBay.  Go to opianthony.com for the link.  What else do you guys want to see really fast?  Steve's Flame shirt, Anthony.  Oh, how's that doing?  $76.  Let's see what else.  I want to see some of the...  Jimmy's Scarface shirt, $134. 
[03:08:30]  Atta boy.  There you go.  Intern for a day, $1,500 already.  And that's a dumb one because we're just going to make funny and abuse you all morning.  That's not true.  You'll be treated with dignity and respect.  They're going to go run for coffee and food and they're going to be a real intern for  a day.  You think that you really, you think I'm going to let some sociopath go fetch my food?  No, he will not be getting food.  I don't know what he's going to be doing.  I thought you got to use one of your interns for the day.  That would be nice.  You send Bill down to somebody and let them have an intern. 
[03:09:00]  We've got to talk to Bill.  Yeah.  Bill is getting a lot done around here.  It's kind of scary.  Yeah, he's good, man.  Jim Norton's Ozzy Osbourne photos and those awful frames.  That's up to $43.  We're not getting rid of them for less than $1,500.  Those are fantastic frames.  The entire collection?  That's right.  Brian Riggins' Cup of Dirt, $305.  Just about done here.  A couple more items really fast.  Oh, the Rolling Stone pinball machine, a piece of the pinball machine that I snatched.  Piece of history, O.P.  That's up to $74. 
[03:09:30]  The inappropriate, Bill Anthony, that we're giving away, unfortunately, $202, but it's for a good  cause.  $202.  And Stalker Patty's wig, $103.  Eric, are we adding anything else today, or that's about it?  No, there's more coming.  All right, Eric's going to be adding more items.  Go to opianthony.com for the link to our O&A auction for the victims of Hurricane Katrina.  Hey, Bill, what's up?  Hey, how's it going?  I'm hearing him in one ear.  In one ear, isn't he?  One ear.  No, it's no switch on the mic for that.  No, that's going to be a problem.  All right.  Okay, so, yeah. 
[03:10:00]  One ear.  What's going on?  Maybe if the other mic is good for the other ear, he could use both.  Yo.  That's better.  I feel like a silent theory.  Works.  If that turned him into a radio.  That might work.  You got it?  Yep.  There it is.  How's everything going?  Good.  You've been a busy little beaver, haven't you?  Yes.  You're running around.  They got you doing all kinds of things.  Yes.  Construction?  Yeah, I just put together the new shelf over there.  In what I hear was record time. 
[03:10:30]  I wouldn't know.  But I put up the shelf and I consolidated all the, not merch, but all your giveaway stuff onto there.  So now it's doing it all.  You are quickly being known as the quick guy.  You're a fast guy.  Like, you went out to get food, I guess, this morning?  Yeah.  And you were back so quickly that you shocked everybody.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Oh, I don't think you should eat at Rock and Roll Deli anymore. 
[03:11:00]  Why?  It stinks, by the way.  Good point, Bill.  I saw a roach there.  Good.  You did.  Yeah.  Just saying no.  See, no more.  Rock and Roll Deli sucks.  There's roaches in every restaurant in New York.  That is true.  I actually saw it.  I mean, they can't even open an apartment.  Bill, the intern, who, it's, I met you when?  Last Thanksgiving, I guess?  Oh, yeah.  He drove all the way down to see us in D.C., and he gave me a film script to critique.  And I think you had a part for Voss? 
[03:11:30]  Oh, yeah.  We were talking to him about it.  Yeah.  And did you have a part for Jimmy, too?  I want to be in the motion picture business.  Yeah, we were going to eventually get to Jim and offer him a grand or whatever to be in there.  So he goes, could you read this script and critique it?  And I go, I'm not in the film business.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  I'm trying to act like maybe it would be better if you check somebody.  Well, just from a comedy standpoint, I want to see what you think of some of this stuff.  It was terrifying.  It was.  Yeah.  All I wrote back to him was, it's very aggressive.  Yeah.  Aggressive. 
[03:12:00]  Wow.  Good word.  I met him and, you know, got that, you know, kind of scary Bill feeling where you can actually picture him coming back and shooting everybody.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  It's not that easy.  I can picture him running naked down the street while Bronson chases him.  What do you use this for?  Jerking off?  But it was kind of a comedy about a guy forcing a girl to have an abortion and saying, I'll punch you in the stomach.  Real good.  Yeah.  That's a comedy.  Well, that's just, well, yeah, well, the script itself isn't really about that. 
[03:12:30]  It gets, that's really how he gets into his life of crime.  Right.  And he's, is he killing people?  Well, yeah, it's, it's basically about these two guys who do crime and like all movies nowadays, all the criminals are really smart and never get away with it.  So our criminals are just really dumb and they always get away with it and their life is just great.  Oh, wow.  But I guess it's like a, almost like a slasher film that you laugh at.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, they're not just killing people.  It's more like just how disgusting like they are and who they work for.  And it's just, it's just like a very repulsive movie, but it's very funny. 
[03:13:00]  I just, yeah.  Can we bring it, you got to bring it in so we can like reenact it.  Yeah.  Okay.  We'll cast the scene.  I just, I actually just wrote in like red pen on it, forced abortions, not funny to middle America.  This is what I wrote back for.  Well, they don't actually get an abortion though.  That was just like a plot point from the meet a different character.  Right.  And then like the girlfriend, like the, actually the girlfriend part is she's probably the most serious part in the movie.  Uh-huh.  And like he just treats it like crap and she always goes back to him.  Right.  And that's what makes him, I find that.  So you're going to shoot this yourself?  You're going to direct it? 
[03:13:30]  Well, we, my friend Ray and I, we, we're going to shoot it.  We put, we have a, we, we saved up about five grand.  Uh-huh.  We were going to shoot it.  We dumped about a grand into it and we learned we couldn't trust our, our actors.  Right.  So we, what about Voss?  Voss had already had a trailer.  Voss couldn't be trusted at all.  Well, we were going to give, you know, we were going to give him like $1,200 or something.  And then he got the, he said he had to shoot a pilot or something.  So then we were like, oh, whatever.  And we didn't get picked up.  He's available again.  All right.  Send him the $1,200.  He's available.  He's glad to do it.  Save the $5,000 and buy Opie skates. 
[03:14:00]  That wouldn't be bad.  Voss is really a good actor though, man.  Oh.  Stiff hand.  Oh.  I'd have to arrest you.  Oh.  But the character he would play wouldn't be really a big character.  We just wanted someone recognizable to put in the movie.  Ah, the star.  Right.  You need star quality.  And so he would just be like a walk-on.  The name.  Yeah.  With a special appearance by Rich Voss.  Yeah.  Because he can't build a star if he's on a small cameo. 
[03:14:30]  It's like in Apocalypse Now.  Remember when that came out and Brando was like the huge name in that?  Top billing.  Right.  Superman, same thing.  Right, right.  Same thing.  Yeah, that's what Voss would be used for.  Are you an assassin, Willard?  Well, regarding the script, there's absolutely no way I could describe this to make it sound  funny.  It would actually have to be.  No, it's terrifying.  Did you read the whole thing?  Yeah.  Well, I read as much as I could.  Forced Abortion is the working title.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's like only like one scene though, like at the beginning. 
[03:15:00]  Right.  That's like second scene and then it.  This Friday, it's forced abortion.  I will punch you in your fucking stomach.  Here's the lines.  And I'm like.  Oh my God.  And I'm like.  No, he doesn't say that.  He tries to trick her.  Right.  But he's telling his friends that he'll punch you in the stomach.  Yeah, something like that.  We got to see this.  Yeah.  We got to see the script.  Honey, there's a banana peel by the stairs.  And I had never met the kid before.  I've always seen him since until I came back in here. 
[03:15:30]  Yeah.  You know, other than I turned it over to the authorities, I turned the script over to the authorities.  Of course.  Well, you should.  If I disappear, this is where I am.  I kind of feel safe around Bill.  Bill's a good boy.  We like Bill.  Well, I know he loves the comedy business.  He loves radio.  He's going to do well in it.  I hope so.  And he can build things.  Just try to stay away from the drugs.  What is the ambition?  Where does Bill want to be in five years?  Five years?  Yeah.  Rikers?  Yeah.  Well, I would hope to be working for XM Sally Radio. 
[03:16:00]  The only thing that would be stopped at if the cops find out where you hid your mom.  That's the only thing that's going to keep you from reaching that dream.  Yeah.  All right.  We have Pat from Monaki in studio.  Oh.  Where did he come from?  Have you brought an item by for the Opie and Anthony auction?  Why, yes, I have.  Wow.  I have my Nathan's Philadelphia Qualifier first place trophy.  Wow.  And my Nathan's Coney Island Finals competitors pass.  Wow.  Let me see the pass.  Oh, thank you.  How many did you eat in that village? 
[03:16:30]  20.  20 in nine minutes?  12.  12 minutes.  Then I have 20 again.  Do you really think someone's going to bid on that?  I might.  Maybe.  Hopefully.  You'd help the people better just sending it.  I'll bid on it myself.  By sending hot dogs.  Maybe if you stop eating something.  I have been stepped on like a fucking roach.  What happened, Anthony?  It was another great line that he got on, but he got stepped on.  For some reason, I can't get him out. 
[03:17:00]  I try.  I'm actually saying I'm louder than I should just to get out.  And then King Kong Bundy just body slammed my line.  You're just having bad luck today.  I'm having awful luck.  This has nothing to do with you today.  For some reason, everyone is stepping on Anthony's.  What was the line?  Is it loud enough?  What was the line?  Now I'm not going to say that.  What was it about?  It was going to be a line about his loving cup and how it would probably be better used down  there for the people to shit in it, but done in humorous fashion and just trotted, trotted 
[03:17:30]  upon, trampled over.  A brilliant joke with nine toe marks all over.  Wow.  You just got that out, buddy.  Nasty sloth feet.  I am having the worst luck today.  It's just bad luck today.  Jason, Virginia.  What's up?  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Hey.  Buttery nipples.  How you doing, sweet cheek?  I'd appreciate some nicer talk. 
[03:18:00]  Go ahead.  You're on the program.  I just had an idea for the auction you guys got going on.  How about auctioning a day in the studio with the guys?  I bet that would probably broil in a lot of money.  Well, it's pretty much the intern for a day.  Right.  Yeah.  What do you think?  We're going to have them do stuff that matters?  Oh, the same thing.  Yeah.  It's pretty much the same thing.  I mean, you come in and you hang.  We'll throw a mic on you.  You get us some coffee.  It'll be a fun day with Opie and Anthony.  All right, man.  That sounds good.  Matter of fact, the intern for a day is up to over $2,000.  We should offer. 
[03:18:30]  I think we should offer.  Geez.  We should, yeah, auction off another one.  That's right.  Interns for a day.  Right or wrong, Opie?  Right.  Right or wrong.  Someone wants us to auction off one of Pat's toes.  Oh, do you have that toe?  Only nine left.  Did you save the one they took?  No.  No, huh?  If I did, I would have given it to one of my dogs.  So he only has nine toes?  Yeah, diabetes.  Yeah.  Want to check it out there, Ron?  Yeah, I'll take a look at it.  I have diabetes. 
[03:19:00]  Did Fiji out-drown say he'd out-drink anybody?  Yeah, he said he'd out-drink anyone.  Yeah.  Except for if they're in the movie The Wanders.  The Barnum Baldies.  Nice.  He cut his head everything.  He cut his head everything.  So it didn't get in his eyes when he fights.  Tara!  Tara!  You guys are sick.  There you go.  I don't want to look at that.  Old Fred Flintstone foot. 
[03:19:30]  There you go.  I'm missing toe.  What happened first?  Did it start turning black?  Yeah, well, first...  It started turning black, then it got shiftless.  Red.  Refused to walk.  I ain't going to walk.  No, it's not work.  Oh.  It started hitting the other toes.  Toe the line, boy.  It took the toenails from the other ones.  Do the Tara impression again, please.  Tara!  Why did you do that?  He joined the Marines.  There you go.  A movie no one else saw. 
[03:20:00]  These two guys know it completely.  That's great.  Thank you, Pat.  That's right.  That's great.  Don't come back unless you have Dolph Sweet with you.  This is great.  It's going to earn a lot of money.  Put this in the trash can.  It's going to get about 75 cents.  That's awful.  All right.  We've got to go to break with something cool, Anthony.  We have another clip of a person getting tased or tasered.  You know, there's a story in the news today.  Police shoot a girl, 12, with a taser at school. 
[03:20:30]  Good.  12-year-old girl, 5'5", 120 pounds.  She wouldn't go to class, so the principal called the cops.  She was getting unruly with the police, and to subdue her, they tased her instead of just,  I guess, what, grabbing her, holding her, keeping up for her.  How do you, why would you need a taser?  Not that it isn't funny as all hell to watch.  I'm sure it was hysterical.  But a 5'5", 120-pound girl? 
[03:21:00]  Not only should they tase her for that, but for wrong answers and forgotten homework.  Yes.  Tasers should be used more often.  Right in the genital area.  Dirty.  Dirty.  Nice.  None of those pesky hairs to interfere with the voltage going in.  Smells like Similac.  Do we know the backstory?  That's some baby shampoo.  We know the backstory on this one?  No.  Oh, well, you better get Martini Steve in here.  Where is he? 
[03:21:30]  Where's Steve?  Someone go get Steve.  He's having trouble, because I don't think he's been able to get his hybrid car started.  There, there.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Just won't start.  Yeah.  Hopefully later.  You know your car right now is 100% fuel efficient?  It certainly is.  Wow.  You finally achieved it.  Perfect.  I really did.  I'm impressed.  It uses zero fuel. 
[03:22:00]  It gets me zero miles.  Wow.  And no one stepped on that, Ant.  That was great.  Congratulations.  Got one out.  There's one for the day.  Jesus.  All right.  What's going on with this latest tase?  Latest tase audio.  It was a 2002, one of those hood-mounted police car cameras that caught a guy.  He was just a belligerent southern drunk who would not listen to the cop.  What?  Jimmy.  It's just whenever Steve talks, Jimmy sits there and you can kind of hear it. 
[03:22:30]  He's mumbling under his breath with a disgusted look on his face.  I love it.  No, I actually...  I wish I had headphones.  No, no, no.  I'm cool.  You don't have a phone.  Of course you are.  Yeah.  The belligerent drunk won't go down for the cop until he gets tased.  Why was he pulled over?  Does he have no idea?  It doesn't say.  It doesn't say.  These videos are all the rage on the Internet.  They certainly are.  This is the thing people are checking out.  All right.  Let's listen to it.  I'm not going to get down to 50 push-ups.  That testes me off because you guys give these pussy-ass tests. 
[03:23:00]  Okay.  All right?  Uh-huh.  You do.  Okay.  Give these pussy-ass tests.  All right.  So go ahead and turn around and place your hands behind your back for me.  Okay.  Okay.  Well, I'm not going to tell you again.  Okay?  No, let's do it.  Let's do it.  Walk.  So you're not going to do my tests.  I'm going to place you under arrest.  Okay?  What are those two you're out of?  I've already told you.  I'm out of Circleville Post.  Uh, we're not doing it.  All right, sir.  No, we're not doing it.  Officer, you don't.  Look, I just got got hammered.  You just. 
[03:23:30]  Put your hands behind your back.  Put your hands behind your back.  Don't fuck with me.  Put your hands behind your back.  Don't fuck with me.  Don't fuck with me.  Put your hands behind your back.  You don't fuck with me.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Okay, motherfucker.  Sir?  No.  No.  Put your hands behind your back.  You're going to get it again.  No.  No.  No.  I don't know if that is.  Uh, now we're just on the 3-7-C.  Sir, I'm going to do it again.  Don't do it. 
[03:24:00]  Sir, put your hands behind your back because you're going to get it again.  No.  Sir, I'll put your hands behind your back.  You're going to get it again.  Why are you fucking doing something like that?  Turn around.  Turn around.  Put your hands behind your back or you're going to get it again.  Okay.  Put it right on the ground.  On the ground now.  On the ground now.  No.  No.  No.  On the ground now.  No.  On the ground or you're getting it again.  Fuck.  I'll be right here.  On the ground. 
[03:24:30]  On your stomach now.  No.  On your stomach.  No.  And I'm not going to tell you again.  Okay.  Put your arms out to the side.  What?  Put your arms out to the side.  Yeah.  Now, put your hands behind your back or you're getting it again.  Can't.  Put your hands behind your back.  I can't.  Sir.  Can't.  You fucking hammer me.  Now, wait there.  Don't move.  Don't move.  Why are you fucking...  Don't move, sir, or you're going to get it again. 
[03:25:00]  15, 30.  No.  Wow.  That is a go-getter.  Yeah.  He's not a quitter.  I'm not taking your pussy-ass test.  Everyone has to be tased a few times before it kicks in.  Never just one tasing.  Well, I think these guys get off doing it.  Did you see the guy that told Cheney to fuck himself yesterday?  Should have tased him.  Yeah.  Should have been tased.  Oh, we got that clip?  Geez.  Thank you, Ronnie.  Good setup. 
[03:25:30]  I got to be there for you.  You know?  There you go.  Yeah.  Dick Cheney.  I don't know the backstory of this, but basically there was a heckler screaming, go fuck yourself  Mr. Cheney.  Yeah.  He finally showed up after...  You know, Cheney's the first...  No.  Oh, in New Orleans that happened?  Yeah.  Okay.  It was somewhere down there in Mississippi or New Orleans.  So, he's down there doing this news thing and just somebody who's basically an assault  on the media, but with, you know, not the opportunity to win anything.  Fuck you, Cheney.  Well, guy, he really hasn't said a word.  He wasn't even around.  Where was he? 
[03:26:00]  He was on vacation in Wyoming and couldn't leave.  The fucking vice president couldn't come out for a national disaster.  The second term of a president, the vice president disappears.  Embarrassing.  He doesn't want to be president.  No.  And they're useless.  Yeah.  They do nothing useless.  Right.  All right.  Here's the clip.  You've got problems in terms of the extent of which you can use public funds to go in  and clean refuse and debris off private property.  And so those kinds of issues need to get resolved.  And those issues are being worked by FEMA as well as by state officials. 
[03:26:30]  So there are problems like that that need to be sorted out.  You've got, as I was talking to the mayor in those areas.  One of the things you've got to figure out what to do with all of the debris.  Are you getting a lot of that, Mr. Vice President?  Are you getting a lot of that?  Are you getting a lot of that?  Are you getting a lot of that?  I've never been up on.  I thought there was a fuck you in there, too. 
[03:27:00]  Yeah.  How many fuck yourself, Mr. Vice President?  Yeah.  And Cheney actually says to them, I'll kill you and your whole fucking family.  And I'll kill people that particularly play games with me.  play games with me. People  disappear. I love the casual  reporter. Are you getting a lot of that?  Are you getting a lot of that?  You get a lot of that?  Normally I'm not near humans, or I would  constantly. I like that  he kept the etiquette, Mr. Cheney.  Mr. Cheney, Mr. Vice President.  Getting a lot of that, Mr. Cheney.  He gave him the due respect of the office. 
[03:27:30]  Mr. Cheney.  Don't fuck yourself, if I may be so  also. Mr. Vice President.  They turned the camera around, that was Colin Powell.  With that, we're going to break, and we'll finish up  this mess. I'll bring us back soon.  You're going to bring us back again? That's what I do.  Thank God. By the way, Ron and Fez  in studio, they start up Monday. Party tonight.  Doing their own show. Party tonight?  Yeah, party tonight. BB Kings.  It's going to be a great time.  Opie, Anthony are going to be with us. Jimmy's birthday  bash, me and Fez. 
[03:28:00]  And Open Bar. Free beer.  All from XM. All BB Kings.  5.30 to 7.30 tonight.  Oh, it's over at 7.30.  I didn't know that. Yeah.  I may be able to attend the entire thing.  Good.  Nice.  And then where's that? Times Square, Fezzy?  Basically, it's 42nd Street.  Yeah.  And then we're going to go over to the east a little bit and go to Caroline's to see  Brian Regan.  That's what 42nd Street used to be all about here in New York City.  When you mentioned 42nd Street.  Sure, people know.  It was about porno. 
[03:28:30]  Yeah.  And hookers and smut.  And a booth with a hole in it and a new friend.  Right.  You know, your buddy yesterday, Sam Jackson, was saying before that that was the peak  of New York when Times Square was that way.  That was the good times.  Yeah.  When you were afraid to come in.  When there was an actual fear of walking the street.  Now you go down to, what do you get?  To BB Kings.  Right.  The hard rock moved down there.  When's the last time anyone tried to sell you dope in New York?  Please.  It's been a long time and it used to happen constantly.  Yeah.  Or a hooker.  Mm-hmm.  Couldn't walk a block.  And you know, Letterman still does that. 
[03:29:00]  The hookers in Times Square.  I'm like, you don't even walk down the street, Dave.  You have no idea.  Hang out by the Flatiron Building.  23 Skidoo.  We should talk about the stalkers in Connecticut.  That's where every joke should open.  It's a home invasion.  That's a great point by Ron, though.  So he's still selling it to the country like it's a rough area.  It's Disneyland down there.  Look, an easy reference.  Everybody gets it.  Middle America gets it, Dave.  It's time to play.  Let's see if Keith the Cop will get fired. 
[03:29:30]  He loves to call in the show and comment on that.  Ah.  Keith the Cop.  Gentlemen, good morning.  You have a comment on the taser?  I want to say one thing about it.  I happen to have the privilege of carrying one of these things on a regular basis.  Yeah.  I have not tasered anybody yet, but everybody I know that carries one looks forward to the  day that they finally get to do it.  Sure.  Yeah.  It's just one of those things.  I went on a ride along with Keith, and all they were talking about was, oh, hopefully  we'll be able to use the taser tonight. 
[03:30:00]  It's just one of those things, you know.  I had an opportunity one time.  I had a guy standing there, no shirt on in the rain.  He was slicing his wrist.  I went to the car to pick it up.  I left it at the station house.  Ah.  That was the perfect opportunity.  That was the perfect opportunity.  I made fun of for a week.  You had it.  All nice.  You lost it.  He was wet, too.  So you got a good contact.  Perfect shot.  I'm looking.  I'm going, oh, here it is.  I'm finally going to get to do it.  I go to the glove compartment.  No taser.  So would you just use your nine, right?  Yeah, we had no.  Just shot him.  No, no, no.  We ended up macing the guy. 
[03:30:30]  What's that?  We ended up macing the guy.  That's cool.  Kind of boring.  Did he deserve it?  Yeah.  But there was an old timer one time back when I first got on and he tased a guy in an apartment  and there were like six or seven of us and I remember him just pressing the button.  We were jumping around like retards.  We thought it was the most hysterical thing, laughing.  See?  That's why it's called.  Let's see if.  Keep the cop.  We'll get fired.  12 was a little young, though, the girl we were talking about today, right?  Yeah, that was, you know, if I had to make a decision like that, I don't think.  What would be the cutoff point? 
[03:31:00]  A baby?  I'm trying to watch TV.  He's crying.  Give him a little shot.  Yeah.  Maybe a little electricity will calm him down.  Well, Keith, you know a lot.  Why is 12 years old too young to be tased?  You know what?  I'll do cherries.  Oh.  Wow, he was gearing up for a long one.  He certainly was.  I'm going to tase you.  Like sand through the hourglass, so is the overday virus. 
[03:31:30]  Every rapper in the world wants a video game now.  Is that the thing now that they have to have?  They have to have their own video game.  Like, rappers are very competitive.  We know this.  They kill each other.  They're so competitive.  And, you know, it was sneakers and then, you know, clothing deals, their rides, whatever  they're driving around in.  And now they're very competitive about having video games.  Well, the nice thing, you know, about video games is their egos can actually, you know, 
[03:32:00]  they're like, give me some of that waifu.  You know, maybe like flying through the air with my kung fu skills.  So they want to be like super heroes.  Because they're always talking trash about how hard they are.  Yeah, man.  I want like wings and shit.  That's really funny.  I want to get up on time.  Be at work in here.  Yeah, I want this to be like really whack.  Like something that's completely unrealistic. 
[03:32:30]  Have me raising my kids.  Yo, man.  How about this?  I get pulled over and shit and I present the proper paperwork.  Shit.  I don't back talk to the cops or nothing.  Oh, damn.  I got an order of protection.  I lost 20 points.  Yeah, boy.  Yo, one time in a video game, I want to refer to my baby's mother as my fiance.  Yeah, just completely unrealistic. 
[03:33:00]  Right.  Then we go to do that mission where we shoot up Hot 97, man.  Yo, how about this in this video game, man?  Somebody does some shit in my community and we actually take personal responsibility.  How are you supposed to program that in?  That's too unrealistic.  Just have me flying and shit.  Kobe and Anthony, the virus is spreading. 
[03:33:30]  Oh, man.  We're running out of show.  Ron and Fez in studio.  The recipients of our first golden ticket, by the way.  Yes.  Four to go.  Ron and Fez start up on 202 Monday.  Right after our program.  Yeah.  There he is.  Michael Rappaport.  What's up, man?  Sorry I'm late, man.  We didn't think you were going to make it there.  Oh, I was definitely, I would have called in if I wasn't going to make it.  I'm just, I was.  We get the blow off a lot, though.  No.  So we're used to it.  No, I would, I'm a fan.  I'm a fan. 
[03:34:00]  Anyone who has an internet movie database list that's longer than two movies.  Yeah.  They blow us off all the time.  Really?  Yeah.  What the hell am I doing here?  It's really, you got, you got like tons.  You know, really fast, I just want to tell you how weird my life is.  Okay.  You were at that InStyle thing at the tower.  The other night.  Yeah.  Where was that at?  Columbus Circle or whatever?  Yes.  It was a big red carpet event.  Yes.  The paparazzi and everything, man.  It was a crazy event.  I was walking by with my girlfriend and I was checking it out and I wasn't good enough  to be on the sidewalk. 
[03:34:30]  Right.  The cops are like, not good enough.  I wasn't good enough to at least be on the sidewalk to see.  And you happened to be going through on the red carpet at that point.  I'm like, wow, I know that guy, you know.  And so the cops kick us across the street.  Oh, really?  So now I'm across the street looking at you on the red carpet going, wow, that's kind  of cool.  I like this guy.  He's been in a lot of things I enjoy, right?  You miss nothing.  So then the cops are saying you're not good enough to be across the street.  So then I sneak on a dumpster.  I am sitting on a dumpster with my girlfriend looking at you on the red carpet, Michael 
[03:35:00]  Rappaport.  Yeah.  And guess what?  The cop starts flashing his flashlight in my eyes.  Are you serious?  Saying, get the fuck down.  Oh, you could curse on this thing.  Oh, yeah.  That was cool.  He goes, get the fuck down.  That was cool.  I had to walk away in shame that I wasn't good enough to sit on a dumpster across the  street from this in-style thing.  Nor even look at me.  You can't even make eye contact against me.  You can't even look at the people on the red carpet.  And this is how weird life is.  Now, two days later, you're on our show and we get to talk to you.  Kissing your ass.  That's right.  But you're not allowed to watch him from a dumpster.  It was unbelievable.  I was getting so frustrated. 
[03:35:30]  I'm like, what?  I'm going to fall off the dumpster and hurt myself?  Well, I won't look at you today.  So we'll put you on the same page.  Now, unfortunately, we're so pressed for time.  We've got to get the war at home.  Yes.  Premieres Sunday, 830 on Fox.  Yes, after the Simpsons, before the family guy.  You play a dad, huh?  I play a dad.  A young father with young kids.  It's very good.  It's sort of been compared to All in the Family and Married with Children.  Somebody even compared it to the Jeffersons.  It's good.  I hate to use the words.  It is edgy. 
[03:36:00]  It's a comedy.  It's very honest.  And I think people are going to dig it because it's got a lot of truth to it.  Yeah.  And I feel really good about it.  Is that a point in your life where you're like, holy shit, I'm playing a father now?  Does that kind of bum you out?  It was a little bit of a relief because I've been making movies for like almost 15 years.  And, you know, you're 20.  I'm 35 now.  And, you know, you're playing kids.  You're playing kids.  And then you're 30.  And they're like, well, this part's 26-year-old.  And you're like, I could still do that.  But inside, you don't feel like that.  So this is kind of, for me, is like my first adult role. 
[03:36:30]  But the character's not like, you know, of tighter.  And he's still in the same vein of some of the stuff I've done before.  It's just an adult.  But that's cool because now you don't have to sit there and worry, oh, my God, once  I can't play young guys anymore, it's over, Jimmy.  I want to be an adult because I am an adult.  You know, at least I look like, you know, one sort of, you know what I mean?  So I was looking forward to that because, you know, they got to have it for new kids,  got to do those parts that I was doing.  And hopefully, you know, I could grow up in front of the camera.  Yeah, you've been in some great shit, man. 
[03:37:00]  Thank you, man.  I appreciate it.  True romance.  The Copland.  Favorite movie.  I loved Copland.  And you're always popping.  And as a matter of fact, it's a credit to you that people do know your name because  for a while you were that guy that was like, hey, it's that guy.  Right.  You know, that guy that shows up in the movie all the time.  You know, the king of the dumb white guys.  Somebody called me.  I didn't know if that was a compliment or I didn't, somehow I took it personally, but  I didn't, you know, like, I didn't, you know, it didn't rub me the wrong way.  I saw you a few weeks ago on that show where you're all hanging out at a table with Jay 
[03:37:30]  Moore was there.  Dating dinner for five.  That was pretty good.  You were able to curse on that.  Yeah, that was cool.  That guy certainly made use of that.  Yeah.  It's just guys hanging out, sitting around talking about movies and the movie business  and friends.  It's pretty self-indulgent.  I try not to talk about, you know, I try to be as honest as I can up there and, you  know, a lot of people have stopped me on the street.  I thought you were going to beat up Jay Moore.  I thought you were going to get into a fight with Jay Moore.  You know, it's live like this, but it's cameras and it's going on and on.  They tape for like four hours, so they just take the best stuff. 
[03:38:00]  So they want you to drink a little bit and get relaxed.  Yeah, we noticed everybody's like drinking.  That's how we used to do our radio show.  Yeah, but they just keep those cameras on.  The cameras are really far away.  The next thing you know, you're like, hey, fuck this girl.  So it was good.  It was entertaining.  Yeah, I definitely enjoyed it.  It got a little tense, but it was cool.  They turn off the lights, make you believe, you know, they're not taping anymore, right?  Yeah, don't worry about it.  The cameras aren't on.  Yeah, exactly.  The stuff comes out, right?  Exactly.  They go to the bathroom.  Yeah.  And you notice the level of the glass, whoever's got it in front of them, because I don't know 
[03:38:30]  if it's all done in order or they take things and kind of switch it around.  But you notice when the glasses have less liquid in them, you guys start cursing more and  bad-mouthing other people a little more.  Exactly.  That's what Favreau said.  He lulls you into it.  He's really a very good host because he lulls you into, you know, they say, what was that  actress you slept with and this and that, and the next thing.  Yeah.  You're spilling your guts.  That's a pretty good show.  Everybody's drunk and fucking Jay is tipping back to NyQuil.  Yeah.  Exactly.  NyQuil and Karnapun.  Exactly. 
[03:39:00]  What is Scarface, The World Is Yours?  I see that.  It's still in post-production.  What is it?  It's a video game.  I did that Grand Theft Auto 3 or 2, and it's another one.  I'm just looking at these pictures on the wall here.  Yeah, it's our Hall of Fame girl pictures.  Do you sleep with any of them?  I wish.  Christina Aguilera is a big hit on that wall.  She's good there.  She's good there.  I hooked up with one of these chicks.  Yeah, you want to play a game?  Which picture doesn't belong on that wall right there?  Which chick probably blew me for $35 around the meatpacking district? 
[03:39:30]  I don't see one that's even in the area.  Oh, you better see one because we'll be talking about it after you leave.  I don't know.  Then you didn't see the one.  I mean, the one in the middle with the doll?  Yeah, someone better point it out.  Which one?  Between the light switches.  Yeah, we want Michael to like us.  Oh, really?  Yeah, well, look.  Yeah, there's a problem down there.  Any chick with a cock might be the one on the wall there.  Oh, I thought you were laughing at her wig.  That's a little test we do to the guests.  See that one.  I got that.  I got that.  I wish you came in earlier because now we're rushing, but I've got to ask you about Natasha. 
[03:40:00]  You know, that situation got out of hand.  And I don't really want to, you know, badmouth her anymore or talk about it in the derogatory  because she's having severe, from what I hear, severe health problems.  So, you know, she is a friend of mine, and we did have a falling out, but I don't think  it's a joking matter anymore because she is really sick now.  Is that true, what I read?  Because I read something in the post about her being hospitalized.  Yeah, I mean, I don't know if that, I'm pretty sure that's true. 
[03:40:30]  I don't think they would make that up.  It sounds too serious.  And I just hope she's able to, you know, get her health together because she got herself  in a lot of, you know, she got herself in a predicament.  Did you see anything coming like that or was she always a partier?  No, I did, you know, by the time the eviction had happened, I had, I did see, it was bad.  It was a bad, and you always think, well, somebody, you know, will have the will to live  and, you know, and they'll want to, you know, take care of themselves.  And I hope she's able to pull herself out of it because she's a good person, and we were 
[03:41:00]  very good friends.  It just got really out of hand, and it was just a situation.  It was funny, and it was kind of, you know, tabloid-y for a while, but talking about it  now in a derogatory way is not.  Yeah, she's in serious trouble.  Yeah, she's in, she's in, she's not, so unrecognizable, they said.  Yeah, yeah, I mean, she, she, she don't know Michael was the, the landlord there.  Yeah.  You're in a building or something, right?  Yeah, Natasha Lyonne.  Yeah, Natasha was one of your...  It got out of hand, but, you know, it's like I said, it's, it's too serious now to  make light of because, because her, her, you know, her health is really at, you know, 
[03:41:30]  at risk now.  Yeah.  So it's, it's not, I don't think it's...  Yeah, maybe someday you hook up and be able to laugh about it.  Hopefully, hopefully.  Yeah, great.  You trashed my place.  Yeah, yeah, I would, I would like to, because it got a little out of hand.  It did get out of hand.  I was upset and, you know, I'm sure, whatever.  I just hope she, she...  You made a few movies with her.  Yeah, I made, I made, I made, I was in a couple of movies.  We haven't really made...  So that comic book one.  Exactly.  It was fair.  Yeah.  Fair.  It was fair.  I watched that one.  Yeah.  That was pretty cool.  It was weird.  Donald Logue, very good actor, and myself and Natasha Lyonne and a couple other weirdo actors 
[03:42:00]  and stuff like that.  But I appreciate you guys squeezing me in and I'm sorry I came in late, man.  I hope you guys get a chance to do the show.  I'll be back here again, man.  Yeah, absolutely.  I'd love to come on.  For a longer interview.  Absolutely, absolutely.  We only got like 40 seconds.  We're on like a master computer and then they shut the show off.  So the next 40 seconds, let's just say the war at home Sunday after the Simpsons.  The war at home Sunday after the Simpsons.  War at home Sunday after the Simpsons.  Before the family guy.  They're giving you a great time slot.  Yeah, it's good.  Sandwiched in between those two shows.  Yeah, you guys should check it out.  I think you'll do it. 
[03:42:30]  And your son in the show, you're not sure if he's gay.  We don't know what his problem is.  We did another episode where my stash of weed disappears and I go to my 16-year-old daughter  because she's just finally acting pleasant to be around.  And, you know, it's good stuff.  It's heads on.  You know, there's no censors.  You know, the comedy is good.  I think people are going to dig it.  All right.  It's Michael Rappaport.  And I want to thank Ron and Fez for stopping by for two days.  Listen Monday.  Live.  First show.  All right.  We're out of here, man.  Have a great weekend.  Later.  Later.  I'm out of here. 
[03:43:00]  That's it.  I'm out of here.  I'm out of here. </pre>
