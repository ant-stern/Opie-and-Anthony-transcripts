<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opens with the hosts, Opie, Anthony, and James Norton, jokingly referring to themselves as "rabid radio retards" and recounting past controversies, including the infamous "voyeur bus" incident.  William Donahue from the Catholic League surprisingly appears as a guest, offering a surprisingly conciliatory message regarding their past actions.  The main discussion revolves around the arrest of radio host "Star" for on-air threats against a rival's four-year-old daughter and use of racial slurs. This sparks a debate on free speech, offensive humor, and double standards in media, comparing "Star's" actions to other controversial moments like the "Wetback Steakhouse" parody commercial by Roger and JP.  The hosts engage in a vulgar discussion, rife with racial slurs and stereotypes, primarily directed at Newsday writer Cheryl McCarthy, and her article criticizing shock jocks.  Listener calls intensify the conversation.  A "Greaseman" bit further exemplifies their offensive humor. The segment concludes with continued attacks on McCarthy and a refusal to apologize for their style.

The show continues with a discussion on public figures using shock jock stories for publicity, deemed ineffective.  Listener calls follow, including one correcting their misidentification of a Filipino as Puerto Rican, leading to a debate on the offensiveness of "flip." Another caller expresses strong support.  A humorous, crudely described story about a burglar stuck in a chimney leads to offensive jokes about birds, culminating in the unexpected in-studio appearance of Tom Chiasano, a bird owner, who shares anecdotes about his foul-mouthed parrot.  The hosts, despite occasional (and often sarcastic) apologies, continue with bird-related jokes.  A lengthy, graphic description of a naked woman visible outside the studio window follows, detailing her actions.  This segues into hurricane season forecasts, more calls, and discussions about various topics, including a caller's comment on a hurricane-induced ice age and a newscaster's resemblance to Casey Kasem.  The listener call dump button is also discussed.

Former Major League Baseball commissioner Faye Vincent is interviewed, discussing baseball controversies like the Pete Rose gambling scandal and steroid use. He shares his opinions on involved players and the investigative challenges, also touching upon a controversial newspaper photograph and his book.  The discussion returns to the naked woman and promotes Jim Norton's stand-up show, upcoming appearances on Hannity & Colmes, and a segment with the "review crew." A caller praises the Vincent interview as the highlight.  The segment concludes with a mention of a particularly offensive chapter title from Vincent's book.


The next segment begins with a discussion about a book's humorous chapter title referencing Joe DiMaggio. A caller, Daniel, claiming to have bone and prostate cancer, is subjected to a skeptical and crude interrogation by the hosts about his illness, leading to a contentious exchange.  Opie recounts an encounter with a dying Peter Jennings, relating the darkly humorous "good luck, bro" comment.  A poor weather report leads to a description of their rain-soaked walk to the studio, including interactions with staff and a bus driver.

The latter half focuses on listener complaints about repetitive XM replay scheduling and technical issues.  A poorly attended live appearance is discussed, blaming poor marketing and technical malfunctions.  A future event with Korn is vehemently rejected due to past technical problems.  Further complaints about replay schedules, listener feedback, and behind-the-scenes management issues are aired.  Jim Norton's stand-up appearances are mentioned, alongside listener calls and interactions.  Profanity, offensive language, and sexually suggestive comments are frequent.


The final excerpt opens with a Toronto caller praising the show but criticizing weekend technical issues. A humorous exchange with their regular bus driver follows.  A running gag about a missing "dump sheet" and Opie's smoothie involves playful banter with a presumably sleepy staff member, Kenny.  Jimmy recounts a graphic and explicit tale of a massage that unexpectedly turned sexual, ultimately failing due to a pricing disagreement.  The "Daily Dump Report," containing only one submission, is discussed, followed by more details about Jimmy's spa experience, focusing on his nakedness and discomfort.

The segment continues with an email from someone involved with "Perverted Justice," a discussion of music (Wolfmother, Tool, Pearl Jam, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Godsmack, and The Raconteurs), and a listener recounting their show being aired on terrestrial radio without credit.  Clips from "Dateline: To Catch a Predator" are played. The segment is characterized by frequent interruptions, digressions, and crude jokes.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show on XM202, featuring Opie, Anthony, and James Norton.  Ladies and gentlemen, introducing William Donahue, president of the Catholic League.  We all screw up. You guys are obviously very talented fellas.  I mean, you wouldn't have done so well before, and then you bounced back very quickly.  So, I mean, you've got a great audience out there.  So what am I going to do? Just sit around here and lambate Opie and Anthony for the rest of my life?  I don't go around holding grudges with people. You know, I move on.  And, you know, I just wish you well. I just wish you well. Wish you well. Wish you well. 
[00:00:30]  Push the button! Push the button! Push the button!  Can you hear me? No! Shut up!  It's me and Anthony! We're so excited to be back.  Rabid radio retards. Wow! We're dummies!  We're the only radio show that makes you want to hate us.  We've been known to get our faces in the news. We're perverts. Stupid.  We eat. Dang. We just love doing radio.  This is a weird show.  No one puts asses in the seat like Greg and Tony. 
[00:01:00]  Opie. I love the hitting and the fighting.  Anthony.  I'm a terrorist looking for other terrorists.  James.  I'm a speechless, worthless nothing. We all know that.  I love women.  I'm a slump, fat pig.  And a crew of misfits.  Hurricane Ben!  Ben looks like a tall baby.  You're like Chuckie.  Martini Steve!  Steve is a piece of garbage.  Perfectly enunciating boobs that we paint him out to be.  E-Rock!  Hopefully he's going through a car wash with his mouth open.  I bring nothing to the table.  I don't care!  Shut up!  No.  What's wrong, Eric? 
[00:01:30]  My cross is burning so bad.  Sit down and put on your laughing hats.  Just relax. Here comes the funny.  Welcome to the Opian House.  Shut up!  But enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  Is that your little brother?  He's a good looking kid.  Act like wherever you are, that's the place to be. 
[00:02:00]  This is great iced tea.  This is great iced tea.  This is great iced tea.  Hey, Red, would you get that out of the hamper?  Out of the hamper?  Oh, Debbie.  How you doing?  Good morning and welcome to the Opian Anthony program.  Hi, everybody.  The good old O&A virus spreading across America thanks to XM Satellite Radio 
[00:02:30]  and some fine radio stations on regular radio, terrestrial radio, commercial radio.  CB.  CB radio.  Ham.  Podcast.  Are we on the ham radio yet?  Internet radio.  I know this much.  We're shocking.  We're shocking.  Freaking shocking.  They add us into all the shockers.  Stories over the weekend. 
[00:03:00]  There's been a lot of them because of a star here in New York.  Star got arrested from the Star and Buck Wild show.  But there's no Buck Wild.  But there's no Buck Wild, apparently.  Big controversy here, bigger than any shootings or threats to four-year-olds or anything,  is that the Star and Buck Wild show consists of Star.  He made up the Buck Wild character, and occasionally there would be a guy that he would refer to as Buck Wild,  whether it would just be a friend or his brother or something.  And then most of the time, it was just Star, and it was an imaginary Buck Wild that he would act as. 
[00:03:30]  He was Buck Wild?  Yeah, Jimmy.  See, Jimmy isn't really here.  It's the Opie Anthony and Jimmy's, but Jimmy's show, but Jimmy's not here.  We just made him up.  No.  No.  You're really not there.  You're really not here.  You're like Buck Wild.  Buck Jimmy.  I'm hurt that there was no Buck Wild. 
[00:04:00]  It's really not Buck Jimmy.  It's something that rhymes with Buck Jimmy.  It has that in front of it.  So we made all the stories over the weekend.  Yeah, yeah.  They kind of added us into the shock shock story.  We've gotten to the point in our careers every time another show screws up,  they have to mention one of the greatest screw-ups in radio history.  Yeah, yeah.  But now I think we take second place.  Why? 
[00:04:30]  Because this guy got arrested, he had his gun taken away.  He was incarcerated, the host himself.  I did see one article where it said that he was able to do something that  Howard Stern, Don Imus, Opie Anthony, and others were not able to accomplish.  Yeah.  To actually get arrested for a radio show.  Didn't it make you feel kind of bad?  Like we couldn't really pull it off totally?  That just makes me want to try harder.  Doesn't it make you want to try and be arrested? 
[00:05:00]  Makes me want to try harder.  Because one person on the air being arrested, the host, not as good as three hosts being  arrested.  Jimmy was arrested for this show.  So what are you talking about?  I spent the night in the slammer.  In the pokey?  I sacrificed my bottom for this show.  We had people arrested for this show already.  Yes, we did.  For the voyeur bus.  We had people arrested twice for two separate incidents.  People were arrested for the voyeur bus incident where we had a transparent bus, bus with glass, 
[00:05:30]  plexiglass sides, drive around Manhattan with naked girls in there, showering and making out with each other and whatnot.  Flashing.  Flashing.  Driving around the city.  It culminated in a shower that they took in front of Giuliani's office and then drove back  up 6th Avenue where they ran into no traffic whatsoever, which was a little odd. 
[00:06:00]  And police blockades all up the side of the road.  And it was a little odd until we realized, oh my goodness, it's because President Clinton's motorcade is coming through.  And that's when black vehicles swooped down on the bus and arrested everybody on the bus and tore the bus apart looking for anything.  Dopes.  So they arrested everybody.  This day I'm wondering where the bus made the wrong turn. 
[00:06:30]  Where did it make that wrong turn onto the presidential motorcade route?  There wasn't another car in Manhattan that was on the same road.  It was, I won't try to, you know, fake it and say that the, you know, Clinton was pulled up next to the bus going,  hi girls, we're great.  No, they just had it all blocked up.  It was blocked up and he had left the airport.  Right.  And he was on his way, but the only vehicle that was on the closed road was this bus full of naked girls and our stupid crew. 
[00:07:00]  And, yes, they got arrested.  They sure did.  And Jimmy was one of them.  Yes, and Louis Black was one.  Our big bear, Steve.  Steve was there.  Rick Delgado.  Yeah, our old producer, Rick.  Ben, no.  Okay.  No.  All right.  All right.  My psycho mark.  Yeah.  And Louis Black and I smoked back then.  I think Louis still does.  And to have to go that long without a cigarette, it was just death.  You were saying that was like the hardest part.  By far the hardest part.  Yeah.  And having to fight the urge to use the toilet because it looked like there was hepatitis on the seat. 
[00:07:30]  Probably was.  I'm sure there was.  And on those bologna sandwiches they gave you.  So we've had people arrested for this radio show.  And then we had the couple was arrested for the St. Pat's incident.  Yes.  They were arrested.  So we've had people arrested, but never us.  Well, we were good at hiding.  Yeah.  We hid.  Remember when we did the Sex with Sam thing?  They did say they were coming to get us?  Yeah.  There was a day or two where they said you will get arrested for this.  We were just sitting waiting to be arrested.  And it never happened. 
[00:08:00]  So thank God.  Awful thing to do.  But if I got arrested, I would have yelled that I'm the new Lenny Bruce too.  Yes.  Man.  Because that's what Lenny Bruce was all about.  Racist pedophile jokes.  You idiot.  I'm not familiar with a lot of Lenny's material.  I know what he was all about, but I don't remember the threatening a four-year-old bit.  The problem with comparing yourself to Lenny Bruce is A, Lenny was white, which is always better.  Also.  Inappropriate, Bill. 
[00:08:30]  Hold on.  Lenny was.  No, Lenny was a comic, though.  It's like this.  Stop.  You're trying to be a thug.  You're trying to, like, go to guy into coming for you.  If he just made fun of the guy's daughter and his wife's ethnicity, he never should have apologized for making Asian jokes.  I'm sorry.  You shouldn't.  But for threatening the kid, that you can't do.  Lenny wouldn't have threatened a four-year-old to goad somebody else's father to come for him with a gun.  Lenny wouldn't have done that.  So you're not Lenny Bruce.  Stupid.  It was so over the top of a threat.  Like, even in some realm of insanity, you can almost make that funny as if you're going to dress up as a stereotypical creep ice cream man guy and drive around and ask what her favorite ice cream is kind of thing. 
[00:09:00]  And, like, not get as in-depth into it as he did.  I mean, he went so far that even if it wasn't a child, if you were talking about a 25-year-old woman, you can't say that stuff on the radio.  It's against the FCC regs.  You're done. 
[00:09:30]  The way he was putting it was so graphic.  Did you just say regs?  I thought you did, too, and I was going to go.  You know why?  It's early Monday, and I didn't want to say regulations because it's too much words for a Monday.  Yeah, man.  The regs.  All right.  Oh, don't be so nagged.  Let me just hold on.  Let me get on my cross before you start.  Let me crawl up here.  No one's going to cruise you.  Okay, I'm on my...  Oh, shut.  Don't be such a fat.  Stop defending the... 
[00:10:00]  The regs, man.  People have used rules and regs for years.  They've said that.  It's not like I'm pulling this out of my ass.  Stop it.  Sorry.  All right, continue.  Go one to regs.  Right, right.  Continue.  Now that I've been degraded, no.  I refuse to continue.  Well, we're making some very important points here this morning. 
[00:10:30]  So Star, he gets arrested.  I was embarrassed for him because they take him out of the police headquarters, and there's only...  HQ.  Huh?  And the only thing he would say to the press is that you're looking at the new Lenny Bruce.  Yeah, the new Lenny Bruce.  I got douche chills.  I'm like, ugh.  Yeah, that's...  You really should read up on Lenny Bruce before you pull that one out of your back pocket.  But Lenny's arrest was completely because it was in poor taste.  But when you do have a threat to a four-year-old and you're a gun owner, there's a little bit of a different set of circumstances. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah, there's something going on, and we've talked about this in the black community, where there's just this goading that goes on.  This antagonizing between two people that, I swear to you, ends in gunfire and somebody being killed.  Usually an innocent bystander yards away from the intended target.  But they try to get people so angry that guns have to be used. 
[00:11:30]  Right.  That's what he was doing on the air.  It's almost like inciting a riot where only two people are involved.  You're getting so offensive and so insulting this guy that in the community, if you're a guy and you take that, you have lost all credibility.  Yeah.  So what you have to do is one-up the guy.  And when he's going after your four-year-old daughter, one-upping him is shooting him dead.  And that seems to be the thing to do. 
[00:12:00]  Happens at parties.  There's been a couple of instances over the weekend where you could just look at the paper here in New York.  One of the Bronx, little problem, little problem with somebody, and a girl winds up getting shot in the chest.  She's dead.  Right there in Wyandanch, Suffolk County.  There was a party going on, a house party.  Some people showed up.  They were kicked out, told to leave.  They came back, and guess what happened?  They didn't come back with more punch, so they would be invited. 
[00:12:30]  They came back with guns and opened fire.  And people are shot, and one of them is killed.  It just, I don't get it.  I'm sorry.  I just don't understand the mindset there.  And it happens in the white community, I gather, occasionally.  Whiteies usually just go crazy, bust into a store because they lost their job, and just open fire on people they don't know.  They go postal.  They just, what it was called, go postal.  Right.  Go postal. 
[00:13:00]  Or go post, man.  Go post.  Go.  Right.  But that guy is what is considered a lunatic.  You're a nut.  This whole thing, it's just a mindset amongst a community.  It's become an accepted penalty.  Right.  And an expected penalty for certain types of disrespect.  Disrespect. 
[00:13:30]  Respect is so important.  The cops had to put it on their goddamn cars.  Respect.  Could paint respect on the cop cars so they know we're respecting their...  Just put tuning up, busting ass, and shutting your mouths.  That's what I think should be on the cop cars.  So at least when they roll into town, you know what you're getting.  A beating.  But that's a lot of paint.  A lot of reading.  Uh-oh.  That could be a problem.  Could you do it in hieroglyphics?  Tuning up, busting ass.  Could be semicolons. 
[00:14:00]  Right.  So getting back to the shock jock thing, we should...  Shock jock.  We should talk about this Cheryl McCarthy, who writes for Newsday.  Yeah.  Completely getting it all wrong.  Completely getting it all wrong.  Mm-hmm.  Because there was another incident at our old radio station, WBAB.  B-A-B.  Roger and JP had, what, some kind of song parody?  Oh, my God.  It was a commercial parody.  It sounds like it was a funny commercial parody.  I've got to give him credit.  From what I heard, it sounded funny. 
[00:14:30]  It was a bit called The Wetback Steakhouse, and it was about illegal immigrants.  And like an Outback Steakhouse kind of thing, where the menu included certain items that might be considered offensive.  And, yeah, the commercial mocked stereotypes of Hispanic immigrants, basically.  Right.  No.  So this Cheryl McCarthy, she took the star story and the Roger and JP and all the other shock jocks incidents in the past few years and wrote a whole article on her point of view on the whole thing. 
[00:15:00]  Yeah, it made fun of Hispanic stereotypes.  Stereotypes?  I don't go for that at all.  God forbid.  I don't go for that at all.  God forbid we make fun of others that don't look like us.  Cheryl.  God forbid.  Hey, I'm sorry, but if 95% of one group acts a certain way, it doesn't mean they all will.  Right.  There's 5% out there that are angry.  That's right.  Well, this is Cheryl McCarthy.  She's lost.  Hip-hop radio host Star says he's sorry about the on-air threats he made to sexually molest a rival DJ's four-year-old daughter to go after her with a gun and about the anti-Asian slurs he made against the guy's wife. 
[00:15:30]  He was just mouthing off at someone who had threatened him, he said, and never meant to do any of those things.  The executives at WBAB Radio in Long Island say they didn't mean to offend anyone when they aired a fake commercial for a wetback steakhouse that trotted out every mocking stereotype of Hispanic immigrants.  It was just a good-natured attempt at humor by the show's host, they said.  But don't believe them, Cheryl says. 
[00:16:00]  No, Cheryl.  What they mean is they're surprised anyone made a stink about the hateful stuff they were doing.  Yes.  They thought they could get away with spouting such racist, sexist crap because so many of their listeners seemed to dig it.  Good point, Hall.  Good point.  And sure enough, on WBAB's Roger and JP morning show on Friday, listeners were calling in to say they thought the spoof was hilarious.  Hilarious.  And that they couldn't understand what all the fuss was about.  I just like how JP and Roger and JP were actually apologizing and the bit was only halfway over. 
[00:16:30]  However, I've never seen a pair apologize more quickly than these two.  A bunch of my gods.  This one is called the wetback.  We're sorry.  We're sorry.  We're sorry.  Look, we apologize to anyone we're offending at this very moment as the bit plays.  You know, this is a bunch of pussies.  They should have just hung in there, man.  Just hang in there.  If you're going to do this type of radio, you got to know how to hang in there.  And the broad raises a point about the sexist, racist stuff. 
[00:17:00]  Yeah.  And this is already in the second paragraph.  The think creature makes a mistake.  She points out that this wetback steakhouse is the same as the star thing.  Hey, stupid.  Hey, dummy.  The difference is one is simply a freedom of speech issue.  One is FCC violations where there were perceived real threats involved with a gun and a four-year-old.  Right.  You can't compare the two.  This is the problem the left makes when it comes to hate speech.  Stop lumping in impolite and tasteless things with hate things. 
[00:17:30]  They're completely different things.  But when you lump them in, this is why now everyone, times you mention a political correctness,  somebody wants to spit in your face.  That's why.  Oh, it's like the star thing, right?  No, it's not.  The star thing, threats made, perhaps.  We'll see legally what this comes to, whether they interpret it as actual threats made,  against these people.  FCC violations, the language he used.  I listened to the entire tape. 
[00:18:00]  We're pretty savvy on what is supposed to go out language-wise.  And they were violations.  I've seen violations already that contained the same language that he was using.  Yeah, it's going to be a mess for Clearchow.  They're going to be fined millions of dollars on this one.  The wetback steakhouse thing, offensive to some people.  Sure.  Some Hispanics would listen to it and find it offensive.  A lot of people would find it funny.  How would they find it offensive if they don't even speak English?  For it to be tasteless. 
[00:18:30]  It's in poor taste.  Some people will be offended by its content.  But it fits within FCC regulations.  It fits.  It isn't an offendable bit.  You can't get fined for something like this.  You could lose sponsors if your station buckles and sponsors buckle.  Things like that, which is very important to companies these days,  which is dangerous to the artist. 
[00:19:00]  But it's not lumped in to the same thing as Star.  It just shouldn't be.  And who doesn't love stereotypes?  They rule.  We all love them.  I love stereotyping.  I absolutely love it.  Jokes based on stereotypes have been around for years.  For years.  They're consistently funny.  Ever since we landed in America, we started.  They started making jokes.  They started making fun of the engines.  The engines started making fun of them.  You don't think they were making fun of the pilgrims right back?  Dopey hats. 
[00:19:30]  Big, stupid hats they wore instead of feathers.  Day one, when we landed here, they were making fun of each other.  Yep.  And what is wrong with that?  It's hateful, Ope, but I don't care for it.  It's not hateful.  It's hateful.  That such cant as being routinely spewed on radio shows is proof.  Ready for this?  Yes.  Of how we've regressed in this country in the past few decades.  Yes, we've definitely regressed in the past few decades.  Cheryl McCarthy, who, by the way, is an African-American woman.  Hyphenate. 
[00:20:00]  Hyphenate.  African-American woman.  No, you're just American.  And she is saying that things were better a few decades ago.  Hold on there, honey.  Hold on there, sweetie pants.  Hey, toots.  Why don't you think back what a couple of decades ago were like?  It wasn't just a few tasteless jokes being thrown around.  I think there were things like fire hoses and German shepherds.  That may have been a little more offensive than a joke.  You know what I mean?  And the bottom line is, the only thing that has regressed is the genitals of white men. 
[00:20:30]  We have become such a bunch of frightened, guilt-ridden douches.  Yeah.  Afraid to make, and I'm not talking about white people around the country.  I'm talking about any type of tasteless remark, any type of pseudo-offensive remark.  We recoil in the shame because of this country's treatment of minorities for a long time.  And people have confused that awful behavior, the hoses, with what is said in humor.  Yeah.  There are different things. 
[00:21:00]  Stupid.  Stupid broad.  As a white man, you're open to any type of goofing.  Of course, sure.  As is humanly possible by any racial or religious group.  You are open to it.  You have no recourse.  There isn't a place to go.  Because the second you start saying that we, as white people, that's all they hear.  And the rest is hoods and burning crosses and everything else.  You can't stick up for yourself as a white person who's been the victim. 
[00:21:30]  And I don't even consider it that because it's just, it's jokes.  Of some type of joke.  We've all seen it on BET and other comedy shows where the black comic will get up and do his white man imitation.  Where he's walking and watering the lawn and, excuse me, honey, could I have another martini?  They put on that stereotypical white voice.  And white people cannot, you can't defend against that.  There's no where to go.  Where are you going to go?  Gather up your white friends?  Excuse me. 
[00:22:00]  We're busy working.  But if a white guy gets on stage and starts shucking and jiving, maybe puts on blackface for a part or does something, he's crucified as a racist.  Where do you read the rest of it?  Yeah.  It gets more, the more I read this, the more I want this woman to chip a tooth on a urinal.  For a while in the aftermath of the civil rights.  With a little help.  Here, let's get through this because we've got to take a break.  For a while in the aftermath of the civil rights and women's rights movements and as gay rights started to gain momentum,  it wasn't fashionable to make certain kinds of remarks in public. 
[00:22:30]  What the far right wing mocked as political correctness was really a push for people to behave civilly toward groups that had long been discriminated against, slandered, and kept out of the mainstream.  This meant people of color, women, homosexuals, foreigners, the physically disabled, and those who weren't Christians.  There was, look, there's a point to the fact that the original idea, I think, of political correctness was to keep people from being, you know, treated horribly.  I understand the original motive of it, which was, I think, a noble motive originally behind the idea. 
[00:23:00]  You know, let's be a little bit nicer to people.  They've been treated badly and, you know, you feel kind of, but then when you go into those who aren't Christians, I did two years on Colin's show on Comedy Central, you dummy.  Every note we got about things you couldn't say had nothing to do with not making fun of white people.  There were certain racial things you couldn't do.  You had to explain every time you made fun of Islam.  Right.  You had every time you made fun of Islam, you had to explain it so it didn't seem like it was insensitive.  Colin did a sketch one time where he was mocking the Hollywood elite and their treatment of blacks, and he said nigga in the sketch as a mockery of the way they do it would not allow it. 
[00:23:30]  They wouldn't allow it.  Of course not.  Chappelle's show, South Park, any other show can say what they wanted because there's a different set of regulations for blacks and whites when it comes to freedom of speech, when it comes to things like that.  And it's because the executives and the standards and practice people are so guilt-ridden.  Absolutely.  They're so guilt-ridden.  They're a bunch of white people with superiority complexes, and they're afraid if you allow that to happen, blacks and other minorities are going to see how truly superior and racist you are, or you think you are. 
[00:24:00]  Right.  So as a way to keep them from thinking that, you give them these extra little things that they're allowed to do that white people aren't allowed.  The way you coddle a child, not the way you see an equal.  Like when we got back from Iraq, there was video of me and Colin scuffling, goofing around in Iraq.  And one of the sketches we did was there was a voiceover that Laurie Kilmartin did.  And it was showing me and Colin going back and forth.  And the voiceover at the end had something to do with domestic violence.  Like, you know, we were a couple fighting, like two gay guys. 
[00:24:30]  Oh, my God.  As the third act is coming on, we're shooting.  They go, you can't do that because you can't make fun of domestic violence.  You can't make fun of –  That's the mentality.  Get some 25-year-old chick.  And I fought with the standards department over there.  Some 25-year-old chick right out of college who's going to throw her own ideology in instead of just saying what is allowed, what is not allowed due to the FCC regs.  You know what people don't understand also?  They see making jokes about – what does she say here? 
[00:25:00]  People of color, women, homosexuals, foreigners, physically disabled.  They see that in the same exact light as going out, finding a gay guy, and beating him.  There is no one in this room that condones or would participate in violence, physical violence, against anyone from any of these groups that she's mentioning.  Unless they eyed a white girl.  Well, of course.  Straighten that out.  Rules of rules.  But to joke about it, to make jokes about it, is funny, you dummy. 
[00:25:30]  Cheryl, I'd love to come up to you at a party.  You must just be the life of the party, spouting your gospel as other people are telling funny jokes based on these things that you say.  Because, excuse me, we're not Vulcans.  We're never going to be Vulcans.  We're human beings.  We find certain things darkly funny.  And jokes about certain ethnic groups and their stereotypes are funny. 
[00:26:00]  It doesn't mean you're going out and beating them up.  And can black people stop – this is something that bugs me.  And again, this is more of the white people's fault.  Like, stop sectioning off things when it's convenient.  Like, for instance, you don't have a white section anywhere.  And I know, well, most of the video store is white.  Is it – like, they have a black section – I think it was Virgin – and there's a thing called black cinema.  Why can't black movies be under dramas?  Like, why is an X listed under drama like every other drama? 
[00:26:30]  Why does it have to be a black section?  Why does it have to be so hard and dangerous to find that movie?  Like, the black cinema.  And then BET, I mean, continues your point.  Well, that's cool.  A little, like, crappy –  Different award shows that are just for Hispanic or black performers.  It just reeks of separatism.  But it's okay.  It's acceptable separatism because it's made by blacks or Hispanic groups. 
[00:27:00]  If it's made by white people, it's not separatism.  It is unbelievable racism.  You're in the Klan.  You hate blacks.  You hate Hispanics.  It's just a double standard that is getting out of control.  Right.  We've got to take a break.  But before we go, Tommy in New York.  Tommy.  Hey, boys.  What's up?  Hey, little Jimmy.  Love you.  Thanks, Tommy.  Listen, Carlos Mencia did a whole thing on – he did a spoof on Wetback Mountain.  And he didn't get any crap for that. 
[00:27:30]  Wetback Mountain.  Well, because he's a Hispanic comedian.  It's okay.  It's okay.  It's okay.  It's ridiculous.  People just lighten up.  And it's a joke.  You want to laugh.  Have some fun.  You can't make fun of other people.  Who are you going to make fun of?  Well, it's good to kind of read articles like this, though, because it does show, like,  just this is exactly the mentality of the far left when it comes to things like – this  is why, as awful as the conservatives are right now – and they stink.  They stink.  Yep.  For you not to be able to win an election, a major election.  This is why. 
[00:28:00]  Because this is the nonsense you're worried about.  Well, we're only halfway done with the article.  Line 10 has a great point.  This woman was talking about a couple of decades ago we were a little more – what?  We were better with the racist jokes?  We weren't telling them as much?  We were being more sensitive a couple of decades ago?  Look at what Line 10 says.  Frankie, go.  Yeah, you know, how did Mel Brooks get away with Blazing Saddles?  Blazing Saddles. 
[00:28:30]  They don't make movies like Blazing Saddles anymore.  You could not make a movie like Blazing Saddles anymore.  Have you ever tried to count how many times he drops the N-bomb in that movie?  Unbelievable.  And it's funny.  It's a hysterical movie.  They're making fun of stereotypes of all kinds of ethnicities, and it's a funny movie.  But you couldn't make that now.  We've got to fight this battle.  We've got to keep stereotyping alive and well.  It's been around since the start of this country, and it should continue. 
[00:29:00]  The fact is we love making fun of each other.  And why doesn't she mind stereotyping when it comes to parades?  Why don't you mind celebrating – why is it not stereotyping when a culture gets together and go, yeah, look, most people in our culture do this.  Why is that an acceptable form of lumping everybody into the same basket?  And yet if you make fun of something, it's impolite or it's sexist or it's racist.  Why is it only the positive?  Why are all Italians throwing their fists up about Columbus?  Yeah.  Or all blacks want to celebrate Malcolm X. 
[00:29:30]  But if you point out a guy like Colin Ferguson and say that's an indication of black behavior, whoa, hey, he's just one guy.  Yeah.  You can't just take the positive.  If you want parades, you've got to take the negative, too.  All right.  We better take a break.  We're late.  We'll read the second half of this article.  Can we get Cheryl McCarthy on the phone today from New York News Day?  Try that one.  She might come on.  Sometimes people's reporters will surprise you.  Well, they're brave behind their laptops, and then you try to get them on the air to discuss this, and they're not in.  And, oh, my God, they don't get in until one in the afternoon. 
[00:30:00]  Well, she would sleep late.  Because they do the math in their head, like, well, they've got to be off the air by one.  She's probably busy.  She's on her period.  Woman.  You're checking out the ONA virus spreading across America, where we love to make fun of everything.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show, the ONA virus spreading across America. 
[00:30:30]  What's wrong, Jimmy?  What's wrong?  What's wrong with this?  In the meantime, Space Hog.  1-866-313-FREE.  That's 1-866-313-FREE.  If you want to get a hold of us today, we're looking at this article that Cheryl McCarthy wrote for News Day.  The headline, Airwaves Regressing Decency.  A lot of talk about shock jocks over the weekend. 
[00:31:00]  Shock jocks in the news.  Shock jocks.  We love stereotyping on the Opie and Anthony show.  We're proud to say that.  Aren't they stereotyping shock jocks in that article?  Of course they are.  Lumping everybody into one category.  If they don't do, you know, some kind of, I don't know, Air America liberal type broadcast, then you're a shock jock and you practice hate speech.  By the way, I want to be known as a shock jock American.  Ooh, shock jock American. 
[00:31:30]  Shock jock hyphen American.  Shock jock.  I want to be known as White Jimmy.  Ooh.  How about that?  That's my...  Well, the article continues.  You're going to offend people.  We're almost done with this.  So she said things changed for a while and it was getting better.  And now she goes on to say, now we've entered a period when hate speech and racist and misogynistic talk are not only acceptable, but encouraged.  What happened?  Sojournistic.  Dwayne Anthony went good. 
[00:32:00]  You said misogynistic.  I just replaced the one part of it.  I think it went joe.  In this right here, in that little one sentence you read is everything that's wrong with political correctness.  The fact that you are lumping in, the motives of hate speech are to get people to truly feel hateful feelings or to go out and commit violent acts.  That's what hate speech is.  Hitler hate speech.  Get a Hitler speech going.  That's a speech.  And when he's rambling on at Nuremberg, there's some hate speech for you. 
[00:32:30]  Because the motive's behind it.  Right.  He's inciting people to go and kill people of other ethnic groups.  Yes.  Yeah.  That's hate speech.  If Hitler got up there and said, how many Jews does it take to open a bar or something and told a few jokes, perhaps he would have been perceived differently during history.  Two Jews walk into a bar.  We condemned it.  That wasn't a very good German accent. 
[00:33:00]  I don't know what that was.  That was very funny, though.  I liked it.  So it's encouraged.  The main culprits are the radio shock jocks, such as Howard Stern.  She mentions Rush Limbaugh, who routinely slur racial minorities, speak of women as sex objects, and rev up hatred against immigrants and homosexuals.  They rev up hatred.  Yes.  Vroom.  Vroom.  Vroom.  We don't like blacks.  That's not good.  Vroom.  We hate blacks.  Vroom. 
[00:33:30]  You're revving it up.  That's what happens, by the way, when you say things that are against the company line, whether it's about homosexuality or immigrants.  You're revving up hatred.  Yeah.  Like, for instance, the whole, I'm not going to do Colin's line.  He had the funniest immigration line last night, which I'm going to laugh for six weeks about.  That's all I'm going to say about it.  But that would be considered hateful.  Well, he listens to us every morning.  Colin, give us a call.  I want to hear the line now.  Unless you have your fat face in a pillow.  What are you saying?  Because Colin, he's just finished in life. 
[00:34:00]  Oh.  And he just sits on the bed and collapses with his face in the pillow until he wakes up four  hours later, nervous and unhappy.  He's a miserable man, isn't he?  I want an ass.  Nor are the culprits all white males, Anthony.  The black hip-hop DJs promote the negativism.  Yeah, listen to what she points out.  Of the music they play.  Music.  Celebrating violence.  Mm-hmm.  The denigration of women.  Right, in their music.  Black self-loathing.  Black self-loathing.  And anti-immigrant feeling as well.  Anti-immigrant feeling.  How about just plain whitey sucks? 
[00:34:30]  How about racist?  How about racist speech about how the man is the devil and is keeping them?  I would listen to WLIB when they were a black militant station a few years back, and it was  some of the worst, what she would call, hate speech ever.  I found it hysterically funny.  Absolutely.  It was really funny.  But it would be classified, in this woman's opinion, as hate speech, because it was all 
[00:35:00]  about how white people were the devil trying to keep the black people down.  One woman actually got on, and I loved this one.  She was talking about how melanin in the skin isn't just in the skin.  It's throughout the entire body.  And it has been proven that higher levels of melanin in the brain makes you more intelligent.  So what she was saying was, the darker your skin, the smarter you are.  Now, if any white person got on the radio and said the exact opposite, that melanin affects 
[00:35:30]  the brain negatively, and that the whiter you are, the smarter you are, that person would  be fired.  But this station was able to just blurt out any over-the-top racism.  Did she write any articles about WLIB in her career?  I never saw an article, a negative article about WLIB.  And by the way, I love the way she goes, nor are all the culprits white males.  Gee, thanks.  Really? 
[00:36:00]  Yeah.  Considering this whole article is spurned on because of what a black DJ did.  Yeah.  And that's the language.  Look at how soft the language she uses when it comes to non-whites is.  It's the negativism, celebrating violence, the denigration.  Meanwhile, when she's talking about Rush Limbaugh, slur racial minorities, speak of women as  sex objects, and rev up hatred.  Hatred.  Yeah.  But then the black jocks, it's, you know.  Black self-loathing.  Black self-loathing.  That's black people's biggest crime.  They rev up black self-loathing. 
[00:36:30]  They don't do anything against any other race.  All rappers do is talk about sex and violence.  They do a little bit more than promote black self-loathing.  They promote shooting each other.  What is that?  They don't, that's not nice between black people.  No.  That's a little self-loathing.  A little negativity there.  Black cinema.  That's all you need to know about the way people are separated.  Black cinema and Virgin Records.  Yeah.  That's exactly, no one's uncomfortable with that.  All right.  Well, she says the tide has turned because the people who own the radio stations and 
[00:37:00]  the right-wing TV channels.  Right-wing.  And those who produce hip-hop music have learned that it pays to appeal to people's worst instincts,  their basis prejudices.  And as much as we deny it, this country still has a lot of good old boys, whether they're  black or white, and whether they're even boys.  You know something?  Listen, when you say good old boys, black people aren't really conjured up in my mind.  No.  When you say the term good old boys, black or white, that's like when people say, you 
[00:37:30]  know there are white niggas too.  Stop it.  There are certain terms that are for certain groups.  Good old boys means racist hillbilly.  That's what that means.  So don't try to turn it around and say that it's about-  Whether they're black or white.  Right.  Just keep the article all safe.  All safe.  Of course you coward.  This woman stinks.  She's awful.  And she's a hack.  In the picture they have of the bad people, the shock-shocks, the bad people, this is  the picture of Howard, she has a picture of Rush Limbaugh, and a picture of Bill O'Reilly. 
[00:38:00]  It's an article based on the actions of a black DJ, and you have three typical safe white guy  photos.  Yeah.  Could you come up with an original thought?  Could you have an original angle on it?  God almighty, you stupid hack.  About just photographing the bullet holes outside the black radio station.  Yeah, exactly.  Where's all the commentary on 97?  Yeah.  And the barbarism that's been going on in that station. 
[00:38:30]  Where?  If that was happening at a rock station, they would have shut it down a long time ago.  Hell yeah.  That's what hate speech is, stupid.  Yeah, hate speech coming out of the barrel of a gun.  And I've had enough of this.  I hate you.  Bang.  Who's this Asian guy, John Liu?  Yeah.  Who pipes his stupid face up every time there's a problem in the Asian community?  Yeah.  I like the fact, look, that he goes after black people who are doing racist remarks because  the white people are so guilt-ridden, they never will, but the Asians don't want to hear  it.  They've been running delis for long enough, and they're like, look, we live here.  Well, he got a lot of attention from the tsunami song. 
[00:39:00]  Yeah, of course he did.  And he's got a lot of power behind him.  But the fact that having this guy arrested, it's revolting because no one thinks he was  a real threat.  It's a couple of people who are just covering their asses just in case there's a problem,  they can say they did go out and arrest him.  Nobody thinks he's really going to commit a violent act.  Star's not going to commit a violent act or Buck Wilde if he existed.  Can't believe that.  All right.  The article ends up by saying, because some listeners were outraged by Star's comments, he's  been fired, and on Friday was arrested and charged with harassment and child endangerment. 
[00:39:30]  And only after this newspaper took issue with the WBAB spoof.  Thank God for you, Newsday.  You're do-gooders.  Yeah, you took issue, and that got it all going, didn't it?  And only after this newspaper took issue with the WBAB spoof.  Take credit for it.  The station pulled it off the air and now says it's going to reach out to the Hispanic community.  Cheryl McCarthy, you're just a dope. 
[00:40:00]  And WBAB just buckles like unbelievable.  They are just a bunch of faggots over there.  How are you going to reach out to the Hispanic community?  Are you going to drive by Home Depot at 8 in the morning with a pickup truck?  Yeah.  Oh, sorry, I didn't mean to say that.  Sorry, I didn't mean to make this sound.  Help them out.  Give them some work.  Roger and JP are shock jocks without the shock.  There's no shock.  There's no shock.  The shock jocks, they're shaking in their boots trying to get a little edgy.  And as soon as someone notices they're edgy, like, oh, we're sorry, we're sorry.  We'll play Leonard Skinner Freebird.  I'm sorry, I'm sorry.  I put a voltmeter on both of them, and it came up zero. 
[00:40:30]  There's no shock there at all.  Someone needs to flip their breakers.  They're off.  You know how many times in Anthony and I's careers, our careers, I should say, because  Jimmy's part of this as well, where management calls us at home and goes, guys, you really  need to go on the air and apologize.  And we just sit back.  For what?  And we're like, and they're like, no, you really need to apologize immediately.  We're just like, um, no.  We'll come up with the 18 reasons why we shouldn't have to. 
[00:41:00]  Right.  And they're all legit.  There's no reason to apologize for something someone found tasteless or offensive to them  personally.  There is no reason to apologize because that's the way we are as human beings.  The Wetback Steakhouse, um, you know, commercial parody sounds like a real hoot.  Like, frankly, I'm kind of pissed we didn't come up with it first.  And it should have been in heavy rotation.  Right.  As soon as you got a little attention for that, it should have went into heavy rotation. 
[00:41:30]  If you're offended by, like, racial humor or any type of humor, here's what you do.  Buy a gun, put it in your mouth, and do the job.  Help out the country.  Pull a full metal jacket on a toilet.  The last line of the article, in both cases, they say they're sorry if they offended anyone,  but the truth is they thought they could get away with it.  And that's where the problem is.  Not with Newsday on the case.  Thank God for Newsday.  Cheryl McCarthy, please call our show.  Cheryl. 
[00:42:00]  Please call our show.  Ben, did you leave a message yet?  Yeah, leave a message for Cheryl McCarthy from Newsday.  Oh, I can't wait to read the kiss-ass letters she's going to get.  Dear Cheryl, I agree with you wholeheartedly that this country has slipped into a blah-blah-kill-yourself.  Ugh.  I hate when reporters won't come on.  Like, we tried to get Richard Johnson from The Post on to discuss something.  And we're pretty fair when people, and he hung up on Ben, which a part of me understand that I've spoken to. 
[00:42:30]  Richard Johnson, one of the biggest pussies out there, hiding behind his laptop.  They all hide behind their laptops.  Doing a woman's job, kvetching and gossiping.  Did you see what Beyonce was wearing?  Did Ben try to call from a riot at a Sox game?  Because that's what his calls always sound like.  It sounds like Ben is calling from a prison block that's under siege.  I've never had a clear call from Ben.  It's like, Ben?  Hi, Anthony.  How are you?  It's just panda.  There's sirens in the background. 
[00:43:00]  Wild animals.  I don't know what's going on.  What's wrong with your phone?  You never call from a regular quiet place.  Oh, the Blackberries?  I hear they stink.  It's a Blackberry phone, yeah.  You can't get...  That doesn't explain, though, why you're always calling from the riots in Pakistan.  It's just...  There's always...  Yeah, what Blackberries...  What are they, a pre-recorded noise that plays during your calls?  I just hear noise.  It's not like Blackberry noise.  It's people screaming for their lives.  It's like an Al-Zar Cowie beheading he's calling from. 
[00:43:30]  That's the noise Ben hears in his head all day.  It's just yelling and shouting.  Spilling out of his ear into his phone.  Hey, look at this one.  Eric in Colorado.  Eric, what's up?  Make it fast.  Morning, boys.  Hey, if this woman wants to hear a hate speech, she ought to listen to some of these stations  programmed to the Mexican audiences out west here that call for the killing of white people  and literally the overthrow of the American government.  Yeah, the ethnic stations are allowed a carte blanche when it comes to offending this country 
[00:44:00]  and white people in America, and we have no recourse.  And they should be allowed a carte blanche to do that.  The problem is when you give us flack for it, they should be allowed to do that.  Yeah, let them.  I don't care.  Like I said before, when I used to listen to the militant black stations, I found it hysterical, funny.  Sometimes, like, I'd get so angry and aggravated at what they were saying, and then you'd just laugh at yourself.  Why am I being, but where is this guy going to go with this?  Sure.  A couple more phone calls, then we've got to take another break and catch up here. 
[00:44:30]  Shane, what's up?  Good morning, gentlemen.  Hi, little white Jimmy.  Hello.  Not for nothing, but with this whole Black History Month,  If we had White History Month, we could be complete ass racist.  Well, see, they would argue that every other month is White History Month, because we have  taken the history and twisted it around and revised it so much just for white people that  that is their month to, you know, square things up.  Well, someone had to get history done. 
[00:45:00]  Someone had to do things, build things, get it right.  Someone decided to be go-getters.  And understandable, the history was kind of perverted for a long time.  Yeah.  What other minority groups have to realize, like, Black people, I think, are with 12 or  13 percent of the population.  It's like, you're not going to get equal time.  In the country, right.  Smaller percent of the population.  In the world.  Doug in New Jersey.  Doug.  Hey, guys.  It's a speed round, so make it fast.  Let's go.  Hey, what about Archie Bunker in the Jefferson?  How good was that in the 70s? 
[00:45:30]  Never would be aired.  Yeah.  You couldn't make a sitcom like All in the Family.  I mean, a great example is they remade the Bad News Bears and made it politically correct.  Yeah.  You can't be funny and be politically correct.  I want this woman to call up.  I want her to call up.  If we can hear her, she probably has the hair dryer on.  She's having her rollers put in, whatever broads do before they go to work.  I want you to put your house dress on before you clean the toilet, and I want you to call 
[00:46:00]  in here while you're scrub, scrub, scrubbing that bowl, and I want you to explain, unless  your tooth has been knocked out by a husband because you got lippy, I want you to explain  when something has been funny and politically correct, like when you have sanitized something  and it's still funny.  Yeah, sanitized it so much that it completely, it cannot offend anybody.  Right.  Yet, it is still funny.  It doesn't have to be offensive, but when has it been politically incorrect, funny,  and then you make it politically correct and it's still funny.  Do you think chickens enjoy that crossing the road joke? 
[00:46:30]  Do you think they really enjoy it?  I don't.  I don't think they do either.  I don't think anyone enjoyed that joke I just told.  No, I thought it was okay.  It was poignant, Ant, because chickens have a right to, well, we've all heard what they  have a right to do if you've watched German pornography.  They have a right to yell ouch and chicken talk.  Let's go to Greg on Long Island.  Greg.  How you doing?  Hey.  How about the new Little Rascals movie?  That was really bad, too.  But would you guys get in trouble if you played that Grease Ola Crayons now that you did years ago? 
[00:47:00]  I don't know.  Would we?  I think it can play.  Yeah, let's play Grease Ola as we go to break.  This is the Grease Man.  We really screw up our commercial breaks today.  The Grease Man got in a lot of trouble a few years back because he didn't like a song  and suggested that the singer of the song be dragged behind a truck with chains right  after a horrific incident down south, and he got fired for that.  So we had a little fun with the Grease Man apologizing. 
[00:47:30]  Well, the Grease Ola thing was actually, you did a take on the fact that Crayola.  Oh, that was what it was, too.  Yeah, no, this is even a mixture of the two things.  Well, this is even better because Crayola decided they had to make their colors politically correct.  Politically correct, so they were taking Indian Red out of the color.  Indian Red was a classic Crayola color, and they took it out, and it was interpreted as 
[00:48:00]  Indian-like red skin, American Indian Red, when the color came from India.  It was like an Indian clay red, so they just called it Indian Red, but it didn't matter  what the real reason they called it Indian Red was.  It offended too many American Indians, so they canceled the crayon.  The American Indians, I got a weird thing with.  Like, I agree with, believe it or not, changing team names.  I think they should change team names that are brutal like that.  I don't at all.  I do, because only because no other group is cartooned like that where it's allowed. 
[00:48:30]  Me heap them on fence with that one.  No, I'm just saying, hey, hey, hey.  But if you're going to be that stupid and let us take everything, I mean.  I mean, a few blankets and beads.  Yeah, let's be honest.  I mean, if you're going to be that dumb, you know.  I always said we should be able to name our sports teams after you to make you sound like  you were tough.  Point taken, oh, point taken.  See, that's a joke.  The New York horrible salesman.  We could call the team that. 
[00:49:00]  The New York sold it for some pearls.  The $300 billion in real estate for $25 in beads, you asses.  It's a head by two touchdowns.  Behind by a country, but a head by two touchdowns.  Unbelievable.  Thanks, Sam.  So, Greaseman made a wink, wink, made an appearance on our show to talk about the outrage of changing  Indian red.  And to sell his line of crayons.  Yeah, he decided that he should rename all the crayons. 
[00:49:30]  Mm-hmm.  Da-da-doo, dee-dee-dee, yaddle-doddle-dee, yaddle-dee.  Now, Greaseman, what are you doing?  Snarlingsy, snarlingsy.  I was being offensive.  Yaddle-doodle-dee, gobbledygoo.  Greaseman, you really got to get another job because we're sick of having you on our show.  Waddle-doddle, please hire me.  Somebody hire me, the Greaseman, for a radio show.  Well, I hear that you're looking at a job for Crayola. 
[00:50:00]  Yes.  With Crayola, I should say.  Well, actually, the Greaseman is coming out with his own line of crayons.  Racially insensitive crayons.  I looked in the paper and I saw, the Greaseman saw that Crayola is removing Indian red from  their box of crayons.  Because it's not politically correct and they don't want to tick off any people.  Insensitive to the Indians.  That's right.  As we like to call them, the cowboy killers.  I remember as a cowboy slinging lead against the Indians, their arrows pushing over my 
[00:50:30]  head.  The red skin.  But yes, very, very upset about Indian red in the crayon box.  Yeah.  So Crayola pulled it.  Well, they're going to continue making the color.  They want people to come up with a new name for that color.  Yeah.  Hmm.  Let's see.  How about Kimo Sabi?  Yeah.  Yaddle doodle.  Snarling. 
[00:51:00]  Bone dry.  Bone dry.  Yeah.  You're just not politically correct, Greaseman.  Well, I'm hoping to get some money with my new crayon line.  Oh, yeah?  Yes.  Greasola crayons.  Greasola crayons.  Greasola crayons.  And the sharpener on the side makes the crayons as pointy as my head.  Yaddle doddle.  Bone dry.  Bone dry.  Now, can you name some of the crayons that you will be offering?  Well, let's say a young child, a little young waif wants to draw the sun. 
[00:51:30]  Wow, that's nice.  Nice bright sun.  Sure.  A little picture in his kindergarten class.  You know what color he'd use?  Huh.  In the Greasola crayon set?  What?  Chink yellow.  Yaddle doddle.  Just a big circle, and you're coloring in with some chink yellow.  Yaddle doddle.  And, of course, you can't complete the scene without maybe some flowers basking in the heat of that chink yellow sun.  Oh, that would be nice.  Sure.  Right?  So you draw some tulips.  Okay.  And, of course, you use homo pink. 
[00:52:00]  Homo pink.  A shade of pink loved by bone smugglers everywhere.  Yaddle diddle.  Doodle die.  How about Polish purple?  Ah, Polish purple sounds neat.  Polish purple.  Why Polish purple, though?  Well, look, it's green.  Yaddle diddle die.  The crazy Polacks can't get the colors right there.  Oh, my. 
[00:52:30]  Mick green.  Mick green.  Yes, the color of the shamrocks.  That's right.  Mick green.  Mick green.  Bone dry.  Bone dry.  Yeah.  Yaddle doddle.  Wow.  And, of course, wetback brown.  Of course.  And then, of course, I have the special Italian crayon.  And what's that?  Look, it's a grease pencil.  Greasy little Dago pencil.  Yaddle diddle doodle die.  Bone dry.  Bone dry. 
[00:53:00]  Very nice.  Oops.  I'm being removed from my seat.  Hey.  Oh, it's happening again, Dad.  Whoa.  They're yanking him out of the studio again.  Oh, look at that.  Dragged him out again.  He's going to go back on his apology tour.  Grease all the crayons.  Grease all the crayons.  Boy.  That's kind of cute, huh?  A little insensitive there.  Big time.  Ladies and gentlemen, it's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Radio to the power of rock.  Sounds exciting.  All right. 
[00:53:30]  Let's go to Virginia and say hi to Taylor.  Taylor, what's going on today, man?  I'm going to actually go.  I'm busy.  I want to comment on something.  I'm in the military out here, and we've got to give all this cream.  And...  Hoorah!  Whiteboards.  Hoorah.  We can't call whiteboards whiteboards anymore.  They're dry erase boards, and the turn charts that we're so familiar with, they can't let 
[00:54:00]  us call them flip charts, because flip is apparently a derogatory term for a Puerto  Rican.  Really?  I've never heard that one.  Yeah, I've got to write that one down.  But a white board has to be a dry board?  Dry erase board.  Wow.  Aren't there women after menopause that feel offended by that word?  Yes.  The dry board?  I guess so, but...  I thought that should have gotten a little more.  That should have.  I am more than willing to crash myself.  I thought you meant the word menopause.  I just got men in it. 
[00:54:30]  I didn't know.  I was trying to figure that one out.  What do you got, Jimmy, over there?  The Daily News.  Star boss ought to pay, Paul.  John Liu, he's an Asian councilman, Democrat, is really just making a career out of this  stuff.  Like, the more anti-Asian stuff there is, the happier this guy is.  He said that the ex-bosses of a fire shock jock should make a $5 million donation to the  Megan Kanker Foundation.  Five mil, huh?  That was the amount that he had been paid so far by them.  He said, Clear Channel thought... 
[00:55:00]  And Megan Kanker was a little girl who was murdered by this scumbag, Jesse Tomeniquis,  who's on death row.  And he goes, Clear Channel thought it's fit to broadcast a pedophile's fantasy, so I  think it's only fair and appropriate for them to cough up $5 million.  Hey, John Liu, shut your face.  What does some guy doing inappropriate humor have to do with the barbaric murder of five  years old?  How do you tie these things together?  Yeah, don't tie that together.  It's actually an insult to the memory of the girl and her family. 
[00:55:30]  You know, there are plenty of things this guy could attach himself to that are legitimate  concerns in the Asian community.  He's got some power.  He's got a power base.  That's great.  And he could use it to help out his constituency.  To just grab onto the coattails of these shock jock stories.  It's sensationalism.  It's trying to get your name out there.  And it really lacks credibility. 
[00:56:00]  And usually when people do this, they have a sharp spike in popularity and power.  And then, voomph, right back down the other side.  It's not a way to keep a power base.  You keep a power base by keeping your constituency happy and actually doing things that help them.  This isn't really helping.  Because no one really cares in your power base.  No one really cares.  We got a correction, by the way.  Cockroach, what's up?  Hey, Cockroach. 
[00:56:30]  Yeah, it is Cockroach in Virginia Beach.  And, hey, man, I hate the show.  Y'all suck.  Thank you, sir.  The numbnuts that just called a flip is not a Puerto Rican.  It is a Filipino.  Because we have got a huge flip population down here in Virginia Beach.  Is that it?  Why is that term insulting to Filipinos?  How is that derogatory?  Why is it shortened?  Filipinos?  Yeah, but it's shortened.  Who cares?  That's all right.  But I guess it is.  I don't know.  We're losing our minds.  I'm an it.  Let's go to Jeremy in Harlem.  That could be good.  Yeah, what's going on?  You're a gutter. 
[00:57:00]  What up, boys?  I want to let y'all know y'all got my vote.  You know what I'm saying?  There's officially nothing else to listen to out here in New York.  So, you know, y'all got my vote.  I used to laugh at y'all on 1027 back in the day.  Jeremy, my brother.  Yeah, we're going to have to talk black because there's a lot of star listeners out there looking for a new radio show.  Hey, you found it.  Are you kidding me that Buck Wilde didn't really exist?  I mean, I'm dead serious.  Were you kidding or no?  I was really stunned when I heard it, but no, it's true.  I mean, it was his half-brother.  It was his half-brother, but only sometimes, right, Jeremy? 
[00:57:30]  Yeah, like he had another character who wanted to contest, like, be Buck Wilde for this month or something.  Yeah, like be Buck Wilde for a month, and then, like, maybe sometimes there wasn't a Buck Wilde in there with him.  Yeah, because I was wondering, where's Buck Wilde if you're going to arrest the show?  Yeah, I'd be like, hey, isn't Buck Wilde a little upset that his partner's arrested?  Yeah, let's get a comment from Buck Wilde.  How's he going to get a job?  Let's get a comment from Buck Wilde.  There's no comments from Buck Wilde.  That Buck Wilde knows how to keep quiet.  He didn't even have a mic.  His name is Buck Quiet. 
[00:58:00]  He's Buck Mellow.  He's not too wild now, is he?  Star and Buck Safe.  Star and Buck Keep Quiet.  Buck Hush.  Buck Hush.  Buck No Comment.  All right, Jeremy.  Both times you guys suck.  Yeah, tell the brothers we're out here, all right?  Hey, let's move on to other news today.  This chimney guy is pretty funny, man.  You've got to see the video.  He looks like an aborigine.  Yeah.  Little fella.  Yeah, poor little guy.  Well, the post, just great with the headlines, man.  Chimney Burglar, Bad Santa. 
[00:58:30]  Oh, I get it.  I get it.  Hey, do we know who does the headlines in the post?  No.  It's just another guy that hides behind his laptop.  Can we find out?  Somebody out there listening has to know the name.  Of the douche.  Of the douche who does the headlines in the post.  The one that called you a dopey-opey and pervy pal.  I would like to know this guy's real name.  Yeah.  His real name.  They never divulge who writes these headlines.  Why is it a secret? 
[00:59:00]  You're not working for the NSA.  You're working for toilet paper with print on it.  Well, it's pretty cute today.  Chimney Burglar, a bad Santa.  A bungling burglar had to be rescued by police yesterday after he tried to squeeze down a chimney in a west side apartment building.  I woke up and I heard faint cries and I called the police.  Dominic Singer or Dominic.  What's that name?  Dominic.  Dominic.  Dominic Singer.  Singer who lived at blah, blah, blah.  Said that when cops arrived, they broke through the brick wall of her chimney. 
[00:59:30]  As soon as they took away the flu, you could see his feet sticking out.  That's fantastic.  What an ass.  They pulled him out by his feet.  Thank goodness the boiler wasn't on.  Who's saying thank goodness the boiler wasn't on?  That would have been good.  That was the homeowner saying...  The homeowner?  I'd have been on the roof.  I swear to you.  I would have been on the roof pouring scalding coffee down the chimney.  No, no.  Here's what you do.  Why use the toilet when you have a chimney with a fellow trapped in there? 
[01:00:00]  With a fellow?  Hey, hey.  You're getting that on my head.  As soon as they took away the flu, you could see his feet sticking out.  And she continued.  They pulled him out by his feet.  Thank goodness the boiler wasn't on.  So she's very happy that the burglar was hurt.  Yeah, not hurt.  But the burglar was trying to take your things.  Yeah, he was in there trying to take your things.  And maybe if you were in there, God knows what he might have tried to do.  He was 5'1".  What could he have done? 
[01:00:30]  Stolen your child's clothing?  Little Sanchez beat it.  Here's the laugh of the morning right here.  I'm 5'1".  She's 5'1".  Oh.  I'm 5'1", and he was shorter than me.  He looked like a racehorse jockey but covered in soot.  A lawn jockey.  Wow.  Little fella.  She said the robber later identified as name I can't pronounce.  Richard Voss was shirtless, but his pockets were filled with loot, including a necklace  probably from a previous job. 
[01:01:00]  Oh, I was going to say, I thought he got in and then was climbing out.  But yeah, he'd been on another little jaunt that evening.  And this witness, very confused.  This guy thinks he was Spider-Man.  Spider-Man never went down chimneys, you ass.  Why would, why does Spider-Man...  He was no Spider-Man.  He got stuck, and he's lucky someone heard him yelling.  That's right.  Spider-Man doesn't behave like a bad boy with no shirt and loot in his pocket.  Right.  Spider-Man just puts on that outfit that hugs in all the right places. 
[01:01:30]  You read about every so often when they're knocking a building down, and they tear down a chimney,  and then a skeleton comes out.  That's one of the guys that just didn't, no one heard his cries, just sitting there,  help, help.  How long?  How long do you think?  What an awful death can be.  How long?  You got to dehydrate, I guess, is what gets you first.  Three, four days?  I don't know how long...  You can't last that long without water.  Yeah, maybe three days.  The chimney all cramped up, your ass itches. 
[01:02:00]  Oh, and your arms, you can't get to them?  No.  They're over your head so you can fit down?  Oh, and you're just stuck there?  Help, help.  No one for miles.  Help, help.  Especially if you're like, your arm is pressed against your mouth so you can't yell too loud.  A little shallow breaths.  And you sound real loud to yourself, but outside the chimney, right outside, all they hear is...  There's a bird on top looking down because it thinks it kind of hears something, and 
[01:02:30]  then it realizes, no, let's just drop a white gunky mixture on whatever the offensive noisemaker  is.  So much hope is gone, you think maybe the bird can help you?  Yeah.  Can you go get me help, bird?  Get help, ex-dinosaur.  Birds suck.  Birds are faggots.  Useless.  They really are.  That's how stupid they are.  When they're in the cage, if you throw like a towel over it, they think it's night.  How do you not just kill those things on principle?  Bunch of dopes. 
[01:03:00]  How do they survive and morph from dinosaurs to become such dopes?  A pillowcase makes it nighttime.  It's fine.  It's four in the afternoon.  Pillow.  Well, it's dark.  It should be the smartest things on the face of the earth, being around that long.  Yeah.  They're the last of the dinosaurs for the most part.  Last of the dinosaurs.  Right.  Been around for a while.  They can fly, for God's sake.  Ah, the rooster's crowing. 
[01:03:30]  First thing in the morning, towel.  Oh, how am I going to get up for work?  It's so late.  Every time I see a bird, I want to grab it by the tail feathers and smash it into a wall.  Look, it's night.  Just be a bad pet owner and just keep taking the pillowcase off and on.  On and off, on and off, on and off.  Yeah.  I must be 50 years old by now.  So many days have gone by.  Chomp Chomp! 
[01:04:00]  Emma, are we allowed to make fun of birds?  I hope not.  I don't know what I'm saying.  Cheryl, are we allowed to make fun of birds?  We better check with Cheryl McCarthy.  He wanted to throw it against the wall.  That's a hate speech.  I'm from the Bird Hatred Society.  You people are hating on birds.  Emma, Shwoogie, what's up?  Hi.  Hi.  I just had to call out everybody for missing a really good joke by Anthony.  Oh, what did they miss? 
[01:04:30]  Well, when you were talking about the guy pulled out of the chimney,  he said he looked like a little jockey except covered with suit.  And Anthony said like a lawn jockey.  Oh, that was funny.  Oh, they heard it.  Oh, we heard it.  It was funny, but he wasn't covered in suit, stupid.  It's soot.  You non-pronouncing ass.  Put a blanket over your cage and go to sleep.  His blanket over the old skull.  That's what you do to old people.  Whenever they start talking to you, I want you to throw a face cloth on. 
[01:05:00]  Yeah, you're checking out the O.P. and Anthony show.  The O.N.A. virus spreading across America.  Jimmy, we're broadcasting.  He was in the toity.  I heard Jimmy killed in Boston and Atlantic City, by the way.  Thank you.  Yeah, yeah.  Dave and David, great shows, man.  It was fans with animals came out.  It was really great.  Nice.  Yeah, really nice, man.  I didn't realize how many O.N.A. fans there were, especially from the Philly one, because  it was done originally as Dave's show, and they put me on the show, and it was a present 
[01:05:30]  fight on the station.  Yeah.  And it was just O.N.A. fans found their way there, man.  It was great.  Nice.  Gotta love it.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to John in New Hampshire.  John, what's up?  Hey, listen.  You guys are talking about how stupid birds are.  I gotta agree, man.  That's it?  Sometimes you drive around, you see a dead bird on the side of the road, and like, how  the hell do you get hit by a car when you can fly away, jackass?  Just fly a little higher than the cars are, uh...  Hello. 
[01:06:00]  And you're fine.  And they can turn on a dime, Anthony.  They certainly can.  Not like those dumb alligators.  And why do they walk?  You ever see a bird walking on the street and you almost hit them?  Stupid.  You can fly.  Why are you walking?  And pigeons are annoying because you walk up to them and they just skedaddle away on  their feet.  Here's the thing about pigeons.  Have you ever seen a baby pigeon?  No.  Yeah, where are they?  You know, John?  The baby.  I was going to make fun of you, but that's a good point.  They stay in the nest until they look adult-like and then they fly away. 
[01:06:30]  That is actually true.  They're like potheads.  They just live with their parents until they finally get thrown out.  Kicked out.  They'll live on their own.  You guys have a great show, by the way, man.  Thank you.  Thank you.  All right.  See ya.  Love your Johnny Cakes up there in New Hampshire.  Johnny Cakes is heading back down.  Oh, no.  Vito's coming back home, right?  No, no.  I don't know.  I didn't see it.  I don't know.  I didn't see it either.  I got to watch it later.  Oh, let me tell you what happened.  I want to apologize, by the way, to all bird owners for my insensitive remarks.  I think this is due. 
[01:07:00]  About your faggoty pets.  You ever see bird owners?  I think we could take them.  Here's what you do.  I think we could take the bird owners.  Here's what you do with your bird.  Hold it down with one hand.  With the other hand, undo your fly.  Then show that bird who the boss of that household is.  It's the only way they actually learn.  We're wimps.  We'll go after birds, but we'll leave the pit bulls alone.  Pit bull owners.  You ever see a pit bull owner?  Yes.  Absolutely.  I mean, not in the news.  Whether they're being arrested for cocaine sales or the animals being put down because 
[01:07:30]  they've bit the fingers of a two-year-old for waving at it.  Jesus, the pit bulls have any sense?  How long after?  Jimmy.  That's going to imitate animals today.  That's all I'm doing today.  I want to pet the little doggy.  Oh, look.  He's wanking.  Can you go back to your bird?  No, that doesn't work. 
[01:08:00]  That doesn't work with dogs.  No.  Bark, bark, bark, bark.  Towel.  Save the towel for a tourniquet because your hand will be gone.  You know what the worst part is?  Oh, no.  I knew it.  What's the matter?  Tom Chiasano just walked in, and he's a bird owner.  Oh, no.  I want to complain about your insensitivity to birds.  I own birds.  What kind do you have?  I have an African gray parrot.  Does it talk to you?  Oh, yeah.  It's a talking bird. 
[01:08:30]  Unfortunately, the talking bird sounds all well and fine, but most of the time they're  just going,  Ack!  Ack!  Ack!  What is that?  I like when they go like,  Hello.  Hello.  Hi.  Hi.  Tom.  Tom.  But you walk past them, and they go,  Ack!  Your neighbors think a murder is going on at your house?  You spend an hour trying to get the damn thing to say one lousy word.  One word.  It's just screaming at you.  You just talk stupid.  This bird talks up a blue streak. 
[01:09:00]  Really?  Yeah.  What does it say?  And how did it?  All sorts of stuff.  All sorts of stuff.  All sorts of different stuff.  Yeah.  It says,  May the force be with you.  How old is this bird?  Does it wear glasses?  A geek bird.  We've had the bird for like 18 years.  Wow.  Really?  This bird will outlive me easy.  They live like 50 years.  Does it say,  Why didn't you give me more money?  In February, I was going,  Matt, you should have hired me instead. 
[01:09:30]  Wow.  How old do they get?  They live to be like 50.  Jeez.  50 or 60.  And is it true you put the cover on?  Oh, yeah.  At night.  Yeah.  You cover him up at night.  Then it falls right to sleep.  Good night.  You say,  Yeah.  Good night.  It's a good towel, you idiot.  Right.  I mean, it only says good night  because they've heard my wife and I  saying good night to it  and my son saying good night to it  for the years when we would cover him up. 
[01:10:00]  Nothing inappropriate.  It's all conditioned response.  The bird doesn't say anything inappropriate.  Maybe he heard a couple of things.  No.  One of my son's friends told him to say,  Cook me.  That's about it.  That's about it.  No dirty words.  It's FCC compliant.  Yes, it is.  As a matter of fact,  I think it would have been a better hire  before us to hire the bird.  Hey, it's my bird.  Of course it's FCC compliant.  I would listen to a whole radio show  hosted by a talking bird.  Yeah, why not?  A boozy, boozy, boozy, boozy.  Sorry. 
[01:10:30]  Plus, we have four others.  Four?  You have five birds?  You have five birds.  Okay.  Crazy bird people.  Crazy cat people.  My wife is dander allergic to dogs and cats,  so we got birds.  Birds.  Two parakeets.  Parakeets just sing, though, right?  Actually, they're the coolest of the birds.  They make the best noise.  Yeah.  A Belgian canary, which sings beautifully,  and a Madagascar parrot,  which is blinded when I and my wife took in 
[01:11:00]  as a mercy mission.  Jim, does it talk also?  No.  No?  Hey, Jim, can you throw a towel over Tom, please?  I'm done.  I said I'm done.  I'm done.  I'm out of here.  Tom just nods off when you put a towel over his head.  I can see where this is going.  All right, I'm out of here.  All right, stop.  Tom, what's the matter?  Well, we have five.  It's a towel.  Stop.  No more insensitive remark about birds and bird's owners, please.  I apologize.  They will dump out of anything we talk about birds.  That was me being...  Except your apology.  On behalf of my lobby, we accept your apology. 
[01:11:30]  There's no carpets in Tom's house.  It's all just newspaper on everything.  Oh, no, they eat everything.  Eat everything.  Really?  Well, you got to buy them bird seed.  But carpet, wood, you name it.  Oh, it's eaten through a frame of a window.  Wait, do you live in a home or you live in an apartment?  Home.  Okay.  Home with a bunch of holes near the windows and big patches missing from the carpet.  Birds are loud, though.  My grandmother had it years ago.  They just make noise.  That's all they do.  When they can talk, it is wonderful.  It's fun. 
[01:12:00]  I like when you see a big parrot somewhere and it's talking.  But like I said most of the time...  Can we lock that side door, please?  No.  Holy crap.  Tom wants to come in and contribute.  That was his first appearance on the show and it was terrific.  He had bird information.  I don't mind so much.  He couldn't get in here fast enough to talk about birds.  He owns birds.  For the love of God, let him talk about it.  What do you see over there?  Oh, is she up?  Oh, Jesus. 
[01:12:30]  Hold on.  Hold on.  Get us a mic over there.  Give me a move.  She's awful.  Wait, her top is off.  No, Steve, over.  E-Rock, get out of the way.  All right.  I have a view.  Where is she going?  All right.  The panties are coming off.  There we go.  There it is.  Don't be moved.  Hold it.  She is completely nude and walking into the bathroom or something.  Door is shut.  She's going to shower, right?  Is that her bathroom?  Yeah, I think so.  Look for the right or left light to come on and then she'll come back in and about... 
[01:13:00]  How long does a girl's shower take?  An hour and a half.  She's awful.  Once she's in the tub, wait for Jack Nicholson to come in and hug her.  She wasn't that bad.  She stinks.  She must have been awful because Jim couldn't get back to the microphone.  From the back, she looks like Eric.  All right.  Hurricanes.  Hurricane season.  Fat hips.  It was naked girl.  That's okay.  Naked lady.  It was naked girl, which means 21 or 19, then you watch it.  She's on that exercise bike for a half an hour before she takes her clothes off every day. 
[01:13:30]  You don't think she's in some kind of shape?  I just saw her.  Yeah, she is in some kind of shape.  Just not one that I would pay to have sex with.  Kenny, watch the window.  Yes, sir.  Because we've got to do some radio.  That is your job, Kenny.  Let us know when she gets out of the shower.  She's shaped like a Bolivian fruit.  We have the greatest window here in this New York studio that Howard had covered up for  some reason.  I don't know why you would cover up this window.  I don't know.  We've got a view of hundreds and hundreds of apartments, and we've already discovered the 
[01:14:00]  first naked chick.  And I think even he knew if Robin said one more thing in agreement to him, he would jump  out of any window that was in the studio.  So it was for his own self-preservation.  All right.  2006.  Hurricane season forecast.  New York City could get hit.  We got the good news and the bad news.  What's the...  Now, it sounds like all bad news for getting hit by a hurricane.  Who can forget the sound and fury of nature last year? 
[01:14:30]  Is that someone in the car?  I heard that.  Some of the deadliest and costliest hurricanes in history, one after another, pounding the  vulnerable coastal states along the western Gulf again and again.  This year, here's the good news.  This season, we're projecting we'll have about two-thirds of the activity of last year.  Predictions for this season, 17 storms, nine hurricanes, five major ones, compared with  28 storms, 13 hurricanes, and seven major ones last season. 
[01:15:00]  Well, that's good.  And more good news.  While the Gulf got hit hardest last season, it may well escape a major blow this season  because of a detected cyclical pattern.  That sounds good.  What could be wrong with that?  Just leave it there and it's good news, right?  What's the bad news?  Here is the bad news.  But we think that the mid and latter part of the season, the heart of the hurricane  season, is going to be a specially busy one along the eastern seaboard. 
[01:15:30]  Hot zones in the line of fire are projected to fall along the northeast.  The North Carolina...  Is this the Max X guy?  Max X.  Talking about hurricanes.  Ouch, that hurricane had a hurt.  This guy's...  The Max X guy.  His broadcast should end with a trapdoor opening and him falling into a septic tank in someone's  yard.  What a dullard.  I'm a Max X guy.  Southern New England, Long Island, New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, and Delaware.  It could bring quite a large storm surge. 
[01:16:00]  So there could be massive damage to the New England area if just a Category 3.  But it's not going to happen.  1838.  Surf's up.  This parking lot's full of dead bodies.  Two billion trees in New England.  Anywhere from a 50 to 100 foot wall of water came across the Hampton.  Totally devastated everything out there.  Providence was underwater.  Tremendous flooding in the Connecticut River Valley.  That is one of the worst case scenarios experts fear for this year.  Particularly New York City, if one of these Category 3 storms came in with a large storm surge 
[01:16:30]  and would cause tremendous flooding, that would be a major disaster for the Northeast.  What could happen?  Another worst case scenario, New Orleans.  Still reeling from Hurricane Katrina.  It could be hit with another major storm.  That's possible, although experts predict it would be rather unlikely.  Then why say it?  Because it's possible. 
[01:17:00]  If it's possible, say it.  One more.  New England's not going to get a hurricane that's going to do a lot of damage.  Of course not.  Not anytime soon.  Maybe once a decade that happens.  We get a couple of hurricanes up here.  Once a century, I'm saying.  We get a couple of hurricanes up here that are pretty good every once in a while.  Yeah, but the conditions have to be perfect.  The water is just too cold.  By the time it gets up here, if it's moving fast, it passes too quickly to do a lot of damage. 
[01:17:30]  And if it's moving slow, the water gets too cold and it loses power.  That's what happens.  So the South Shore of Long Island usually gets it.  But New York City, if you think New York City, the city itself, is going to get any damage from a hurricane,  you're so just full of crap and trying to scare people.  It's probably the safest place to be in a hurricane is New York City.  Yeah, I live in a building on the 10th floor of a heavy apartment building.  Yeah.  Is the sea level going to rise like 50 feet around the world? 
[01:18:00]  We have 8,000 mile an hour winds.  I'll panic.  I'm going to drop dead.  Don't waste my time with it.  Let's say hi to Dave in Boston.  Dave.  Yo, what's up?  What's up, Dave?  Hey, Dave.  You know, there was a documentary on the hurricane prevention plan.  I forget what it was called.  It was, oh, The Day After Tomorrow.  Yeah, so.  Yeah, that one.  Yeah, it's a hurricane and then it freezes.  We're in big trouble.  So just worry when that big boat comes floating down.  Yeah, I don't think Boston has to worry. 
[01:18:30]  God, was that movie ridiculous?  Although the graphics were very enjoyable.  That was pretty good.  Hollywood is so quick fix.  Like, I'm writing a short, a film, and it's about an ice age, but what happens is they  predict that we're going to get one within the next 20,000 years, but my story revolves  around the fact that all of this spray can usage makes it happen in 16,000 years.  Oh, wow.  It's like, for now, what are we going to do to save things for 16,000 years?  Are you writing it in real time?  No, no, no.  It's a good story.  Because that would take a while to read. 
[01:19:00]  It's called, what are we going to do about 16,000 years from now?  By Jim Norton.  Norton.  Let's go to Brian in New Orleans.  Brian.  Hey, I just wanted to point out that the newscaster sounds just like Casey Kasem.  I mean, I can expect them to talk about a hurricane after an up-tempo number.  After a goddamn death dedication, we come into a hurricane forecast.  Hi, I'm Casey Kasem.  And now a hurricane strikes New York City. 
[01:19:30]  It sounded more like the Max X guy.  Yeah, Max X guy.  Is he alive, Casey Kasem?  Oh, yeah, he is.  No, he's dead.  He's alive.  Mike, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Welcome to the program, Mike.  Hey, Jimmy.  Yes.  Why exactly do you know what Eric's naked body looks like from behind, pal?  Because we're homos.  Watch it out.  And finally, Brett in Jersey.  Brett, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I got a question.  How come they didn't dump out on Tom when he talked about his bird eating carpet?  Ooh, check out the big brain on Brett. 
[01:20:00]  No, why?  Because he put the listeners to sleep and the guy behind the dump button to sleep.  All right, boys, I'll punch you down.  You got to be awake to dump out of the program.  The FCC would try to listen to that part of the show, and they'd all doze off.  That's known as a verbal towel.  I'm a bird owner.  I got many birds.  Do you?  I thought it was nice to learn a little something.  You enjoyed the bird talk with Tom Chiasano.  Well, we could have bird talk every morning with Tom Chiasano.  The talking bird thing was very interesting.  I'm going to talk about my birds, and I'm going to name them in order of the poverty-stricken 
[01:20:30]  country they come from.  I have the, uh, no one cares.  The, uh.  Oh, jeez.  And everyone's looking at him politely like, uh, we cared.  Look at his sharp dresser.  I was looking at his tie, actually.  Can we just be here three weeks, maybe?  Before we start, I happen to like Tom very much.  He's a fine gentleman.  Jim, did you care?  About what?  His birds.  Who's birds?  Exactly.  Who has birds?  Whoever has birds, their stupid pets, get rid of them. 
[01:21:00]  I don't know.  I'm terrible.  I've done something during my nap before.  Jeez, man.  Wow.  No respect.  That must be a fun discussion at New Year's Eve.  Trying to talk about a chick he had sex with.  He's got a glass.  You know, my fourth bird.  A little fella was sick today.  We had to rush him to the bird hospital.  There's only one in the country.  We allowed him out of the cage for the day.  We thought that would make him a little happier.  We tried to free him.  And instead of being grateful and landing on our shoulder, he flew against the window 
[01:21:30]  until he almost died to get away.  Over and over again, he flew against the window to get away from your boring story.  Because he's dumb.  Birds have no clue that you're their friends.  They just are, they're dope.  There are pets that people have that they love to think, give them affection back.  A dog absolutely gives its owner affection back.  You give him a little scratch behind the ear.  He goes, looks at you with the face.  You can see affection.  Scratch behind the ear. 
[01:22:00]  Take out a Viagra and some peanut butter.  You'll learn exactly.  All right, naked girl's back.  She is naked.  Anyone gets in my way, dies.  All right.  She's naked.  What's wrong with that, Jimmy?  She's got a little bit of a big ass, but it's not that bad.  She's back in the bathroom again, but I think she may come out to lotion.  Ben, your head.  Yeah.  In the way.  I saw the swell of her bosom.  She didn't look too shabby at all.  I stand corrected. 
[01:22:30]  She's better than I remembered.  But then do you remember?  No, no, but I mean.  You saw her three minutes ago.  Seeing her again, she looks better.  Hindsight.  From the front.  Well, from hindsight is where you had a problem, sir.  Oh, and?  You said it was big.  Now she's back in the bathroom.  Where'd she go?  She's a tease.  I'm 37 years old, and I'm looking at a mediocre woman across the street, and I'm happy about it.  There's just something better about the peeping Tom aspect than there is.  We have 18 computers here, any one of which can pop up hardcore porno, 
[01:23:00]  in a second.  And yet we're all just looking at this.  There.  Oh, she's back out.  Back out.  Clear the field.  Oh, I see.  I see.  Nice.  The promised land.  And back in she goes.  Why does she walk in this room for three seconds and walk out?  Oh, my God.  Stay in the room for a minute, you whore.  Jesus.  Jesus.  Is that almighty?  She's like a.  Here it is.  Here it is.  All right.  Wait.  She's out of range.  She went to the left.  Is she getting on the bike naked?  What is she doing?  She's lotioning.  No, she's putting on underwear. 
[01:23:30]  Does this mean another six weeks of winter?  She pops out of me.  I think I see her groundhog.  What kind of panties?  Can you see are they big?  No, she's wearing boy short type panties.  Yeah, she's weighing herself.  Very good, Poe.  She's resetting the scale because she doesn't like the results.  Girls will do that.  Back on.  And she's shooting herself in the head. 
[01:24:00]  I don't think she liked the results.  What was that, Jimmy?  Wave.  Wave.  Now she's just in her panties and she's putting her top on.  But, wow, there is not a hint of a curtain on that window.  And she is naked every morning.  Bravo.  The bra is on.  She is dressed.  We can go back to our show.  All right.  All right, birds.  Stupid animals, right?  They show no affection whatsoever to their owners.  No matter how much love you pour on them, they will treat a burglar in your house the same way. 
[01:24:30]  My ex-girlfriend has a bird and she thinks this bird is really something.  So I met it and I wanted to punch it in the face because I was trying to be nice.  And she's like, just be nice to him.  And he's on my shoulder and he starts nibbling in my ear.  And I'm like, take this piece of crap off my shoulder.  I'm going to pick it up in my hand and throw it at your face.  There are people that own snakes that are like, no, you won't believe the amount of love and affection this snake can show.  No, it can't. 
[01:25:00]  No.  It has no eyebrows.  It cannot even give you an emotional look like he's happy or sad or pleased that you're home again.  That tongue just darts in and out looking for something to bite.  That's it.  When we get back, Faye Vincent will be joining the program.  Oh.  The ex-commissioner of baseball.  Can we ask him about birds?  Hopefully.  And also, a lot of doors opening.  What's going on?  What's going on? 
[01:25:30]  Nothing's going on out there?  Okay.  The end of the Rona Martin's laughing.  And also.  The old telling jokes to each other.  I love that.  Right?  Oh, I like that, Anthony.  I have to go for a 40-year-old joke.  And also, when we get back, we.  My Colin.  We had the review crew at it again from Newsday.  About that Titanic.  They're talking about gas prices today.  Yes.  The review crew.  They get a subject and they all discuss.  And they got a cute name.  The review crew.  They reviewed our show last week.  That's what brought this group to our attention. 
[01:26:00]  And, well, today they talk about gas prices.  Who can review that happily?  Yeah.  Oh, ready to cue?  And go.  Opie and Anthony.  These guys thrash.  Hard.  Come on.  No.  Hey, this is Jim Norton.  Is that too loud, Steve?  Let's do a mic test.  I'll be returning to the Stress Factory in New Jersey. 
[01:26:30]  Friday, Saturday, Sunday.  May 26, 27, 28.  With my friend, Rich Franchese.  Friday, Saturday, Sunday.  May 26, 27, 28.  That's Memorial Day weekend at the Stress Factory.  The number there, 7, 3, 2, 5, 4, 5.  Ha, ha, ha. 
[01:27:00]  That's H-A-H-A.  5, 4, 5, ha, ha.  Because like a laugh is ha, ha.  So come on down.  And we'll do a little tumbling.  I'll tumble for you.  I'll tumble for you.  I'll tumble for you.  I'll tumble for you.  I'll tumble for you.  Opie and Anthony, XM202.  Yeah, you're checking out the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:27:30]  1-866-313-FREE.  That's 1-866-313-FREE.  Still getting dressed.  Yeah, what's going on over there?  Uh, Kenny.  Update on the girl.  She's very indecisive.  She has three different outfits on.  First, it was a black skirt, white blouse.  Then she went all black.  Now she's black and red.  Uh, she can't find the sweater she likes.  She's fixing her hair.  Wait, wait, wait.  Is she a great big fat person? 
[01:28:00]  She's about a size 14.  14.  She's on her third outfit.  Yeah, now she's rummaging to her jaw for something.  Yeah, we got a huge window here.  Oh, she did.  And we found the first girl that has no problem being nude.  No shades to be had.  Not even a hint that she has shades.  She doesn't care.  So, all right.  Let's say hi to Holly in Florida.  Holly, what's up?  Hi.  You guys were just talking about the alligator attacks in Florida.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And one of your DJs said something about, um, running in a zigzag. 
[01:28:30]  That's a misnomer.  Oh, it is?  What's the real thing with alligators?  Straight.  Oh.  That's what you get for saying misnomer.  You boring up on her?  Now there are people that are not going to know how to live through an alligator or crocodile attack.  You say misnomer, and the alligator gets bored and walks away.  And she was able to get the answer out before I could hang up on her.  That does not make me happy.  Hey, we got to say hi to Faye Vincent. 
[01:29:00]  Faye!  Good morning, gentlemen.  How are you?  I use the term very carefully.  Hi, Faye.  Hello, Mr. Vincent.  You've heard of us?  I've heard of you guys.  Be careful.  I'm a dinosaur.  We understand.  Wait, are you scared of being on our program?  Well, you know, you got to give me credit.  I'm an old man.  Yeah, that's all right.  We have, like, grandpas.  Yeah.  We know how to treat them.  We don't go over there and say bad things.  Baseball's got to be the common denominator for all of us.  Yeah, I never had grandfathers, by the way. 
[01:29:30]  I never did either.  Thanks for bringing it up, Anthony.  I did.  They were nice.  Yeah.  Mine were all dead.  Yeah, mine were all dead, too.  Morbid.  I think I was on the knee of one of them for a photo op.  That's all I got out of a grandfather.  They show you the picture and tell you how great he was?  Yeah, exactly.  Pretty much it.  Your relationship with your grandpa.  Hold this thing.  Click.  He died.  So, no, we're, you don't have to worry about us, sir.  No, no, I'm not worried.  The former commissioner of baseball, we have a lot of respect for you.  Well, you're very nice. 
[01:30:00]  I appreciate it.  He's had to deal with a lot more young punks than us in his career, I'm sure.  I've been around a long time.  Yeah.  You were the commissioner 89 to 92, right?  That's correct.  So that was right after the Pete Rose ban?  Well, I did the investigation for Bart.  I was in on that.  I wrote the agreement.  I negotiated.  It was a tough time.  But I'll tell you guys, what's going on now makes that look like kids play.  Well, the Pete Rose thing, a lot of people, like, was there more to it?  Because I thought he came off kind of like an arrogant idiot, not admitting anything. 
[01:30:30]  If he would have admitted something right up front and said, look, I screwed up.  I'm sorry.  Is there a shot that all would have been forgiven?  You know, I think what would have happened, guys, he'd be in the Hall of Fame now.  We'd be doing a lot better job.  What he should have done is tell us the truth.  Say he was happy to work for baseball.  Help us explain why cheating was bad.  Gambling was bad.  And he probably would have been reinstated in three or four years and he'd have been on  his way.  If it was treated like an addiction, like alcohol or drugs, if he would have addressed it  like that, people would have been more forgiving. 
[01:31:00]  But, you know, he never wanted to admit that.  He lied to us for 14 years.  He lied to the country.  And now I think it's pretty hard.  I don't think he'll ever get in the Hall of Fame.  He finally admitted in his book a couple of years back, right?  Yeah.  Somebody told him he'd get a lot of money.  He's always about money, guys.  I mean, that's the one constant.  And he wrote the book.  They paid him.  But he was 14 years late and it was too late.  Yeah.  Jeez.  But you're saying, like, what's going on today is even worse than the Pete Rose thing, 
[01:31:30]  huh?  Well, I think so, don't you?  I mean, we don't know how bad it is.  We've got to wait for George Mitchell, the former senator, to do an investigation.  But there's 10-plus years of cheating, and a lot of guys were cheating.  I had an argument at, well, my brother's restaurant in Huntington, FH Riley's, 400 New  York Avenue, with my brother-in-law.  And he still thinks Barry Bonds is one of the greatest players ever to play the game.  And he doesn't give a crap that he's most likely on steroids.  And my brother was saying, look, man, he hit most of his homers after he was 35 years old. 
[01:32:00]  How could you respect a guy like that?  Well, the problem is we don't know the facts.  It may be that he hit some 400 homers after he started taking the juice.  Yeah, and then my brother-in-law's like, you know how many pitchers are on steroids as  well?  And I'm like...  We've got to find out.  That may be true.  That's why this investigation that Mitchell is doing is so important.  We just don't know the facts, guys.  And we're just going to have to sit tight.  Well, what does this investigation entail? 
[01:32:30]  How are they going to...  Just questioning people?  Are you going to be taking blood samples from everybody?  You know, I don't know.  And I think one of the problems is the union is defending Bonds and others.  And they're going to make it very hard for Mitchell to find out what went on.  So I think it's a huge challenge to figure out how much...  We know there was a lot of cheating.  We just don't know over how long who was doing it.  Do you think baseball turned a blind eye to it because, by nature, the public loves an 
[01:33:00]  offensive game?  I mean, they really do love just big, booming home runs a lot more than they love a pitcher's  duel.  And baseball kind of saw that that was happening and just kind of let it go because people  don't know.  You know, it may be.  And we're going to have to find that out, too.  I mean, one of the interesting things here is this is the first investigation a commissioner  has ever started where he himself is going to be one of the targets.  And so Mitchell's got a very tough job of looking at the guy who gave him the  deployment.  And more important than steroid use, is there anybody going to investigate why George Steinbrenner 
[01:33:30]  still hasn't learned how to build a team of the farm system?  When he was out of the stupid organization, Gene Michael and Bob Watson built this wonderful  farm system team.  And then he comes back and he's trading everybody like he did in the 80s.  Can that be investigated as to whether he's competent?  Hey, how about giving me some credit?  I put him out, but I also let him back.  Well, thank you.  And I wish you hadn't.  You're not alone.  Hey, guys, I want to tout my little book.  Yeah, of course.  Of course.  It's called The Only Game in Town. 
[01:34:00]  Baseball stars of the 1930s and 1940s talk about the game they loved.  Yeah, and it's guys like Tommy Hendrick, the old Yankee, and Warren Spahn and Bob Feller.  It's all oral history for the Hall of Fame.  No money in it for me.  All the revenue goes to the Hall of Fame.  And it's a terrific thing for these guys to be able to tell their story and for people  to be able to read about them going off to World War II and blacks coming to baseball.  So it's Larry Doby, who's the first black in the American League, talking about how tough 
[01:34:30]  it was.  Do you, like, you know how they say there should be an asterisk next to the, a lot of  these players because of steroid use?  You look back at these old days, whether it was the 40s and the 50s, should there be any  type of an asterisk because there was only a certain players were allowed to play or because  of all the, like, the lopsided things that happened back then?  You know, I don't think so, guys.  And I think the answer is just let the public know what happened.  I mean, we don't have an asterisk in 1919 when we know the Chicago White Sox threw the 
[01:35:00]  World Series.  It just says Cincinnati beat them.  I think that Sunlight's the best disinfectant.  Let everybody know what happened and we go about our business.  Greatest baseball player ever, who do you think?  Besides, obviously, Bob Apodeca.  You know, the greatest one I ever saw was Joe DiMaggio.  Joe DiMaggio?  Yeah.  Now, do you think Ty Cobb is the greatest hitter of all time?  There's a lot of people, some guy was trying to say Tony Gwynn, which I didn't agree with.  You know, on the averages, Cobb was the greatest and Hornsby was the greatest right-handed hitter 
[01:35:30]  and people forget about Hornsby.  Why?  Well, because he was an old-timer.  It was a long time ago.  He didn't play in New York.  Yeah.  Here's the statistic that blows me away, guys.  Over a five-year period from 20 to 24, he averaged 400.  Now, you know, that's a record that'll never be approximate.  I mean, nobody will ever go near that record.  Probably not.  A lot of it, though, do you think the hitting back then, I've talked about this before,  I mean, the hitting was so great, a lot of these guys, but a lot of it had something to do with the fact 
[01:36:00]  that they didn't face certain specialists like lefty specialists or guys like Mike Stanton  coming into the eighth inning and just destroying you with his left-handed breaking pitches.  Well, that's true.  The game was very, it's hard to compare, but certainly a guy like Hornsby was a magnificent hitter.  We know Ruth in that era was a spectacular ballplayer.  I think it's easy to dismiss them because they were so long ago, but I saw DiMaggio,  and I can tell you he was a spectacular ballplayer. 
[01:36:30]  Didn't he lose a big part of his career to being at the war, too?  Like, in his prime, he went overseas, right?  He did lose years to the war.  So did Spahn.  I mean, interestingly enough, Spahn spent four years in the Army and didn't win a game before that.  He didn't win a game until he was 26 years old, and then he won 363 games.  Wow.  You know, people say that Clemens or Maddox are the greatest pitchers since World War II,  but you've got to include Spahn.  He was a terrific ballplayer. 
[01:37:00]  And nobody will ever, what do they say, the only record that they think will never be broken  will be Cy Young, 511 wins.  That'll probably never be broken.  Well, that's right.  And I think Hornsby's five years averaging 400 will never be broken,  and I don't think DiMaggio's 56 games will ever be broken.  What did Ruth hit?  Was it 44?  I don't remember.  Okay.  You guys came to the closest.  But Ruth was a very good hitter.  We know he led the league in hitting in the late 20s.  Yeah.  Hey, Mr. Vincent, are you going to be cheering when Barry Bond surpasses Babe Ruth? 
[01:37:30]  No.  No, I really will not.  I think he was cheating, and I don't have too much regard for that.  I want to hear what Mitchell has to say, but I think I'm very confused.  I think most fans are confused about Bonds.  You admire him.  He is a great player, but almost certainly he was cheating,  and that causes me to have a lot of reservations.  Yeah.  And why did McGuire retire so early?  He had a couple years left in him.  Was he trying to save his reputation, you think, because he saw it?  No, I don't know. 
[01:38:00]  I think that he was certainly using this stuff.  Look at the size.  I saw him in Oakland when he weighed about 190.  Toward the end, he weighed about 280.  Wow.  I mean, he was enormous.  He looked like a Redwood.  And now he's playing golf, and you can't even tell that's the same McGuire from a few years back.  Yeah.  He lost all that muscle.  He's a great golfer.  Why is one chapter in your book called Dom DiMaggio?  Well, Dominic DiMaggio was Joe's brother, played center field for the Red Sox.  Great man, still alive.  I love him. 
[01:38:30]  And there were a lot of people who think he belongs in the Hall of Fame.  He was a terrific ball player.  He and Williams, Pesky, and Dora, the four of them for the Red Sox, were a great group.  They were very close.  And I love Dominic DiMaggio.  Now, do you think that once blacks were allowed in the league, a lot of people say, well, guys like Babe Ruth and that didn't really face black pitchers.  But black pitching has never really been the most dominant part of blacks and their game.  You know, I disagree with that. 
[01:39:00]  I think Bob Gibson was the greatest pitcher I ever saw.  I'm not saying that there wasn't.  I'm saying overall, I'm not saying there weren't some great black pitchers.  I'm talking about a dominant force.  Overwhelming pitch.  There were some great pitchers, guys.  I mean, one of the problems is a lot of them pitched in the Negro Leagues.  Leon Day from Newark, who was a terrific pitcher and was in the Hall of Fame.  I don't know if I agree with that.  You may be right.  But, look, the difficulty is most of those guys were really pretty obscure.  And it's pretty hard for us to get much of a sense of how good they were. 
[01:39:30]  I know a lot of those old Negro League guys.  Personally, I've gotten to know them.  And there were some terrific players in that league.  Earl Douglas was one who was just fantastic.  Earl Douglas never really got his due.  No.  You know, they talk about a guy in the Negro Leagues as the greatest player who ever lived.  You and I never heard of him.  His name is Oscar Charleston.  And the old-timers, like Buck O'Neill, say he was a greater player than Willie Mays. 
[01:40:00]  What position did he play?  He played first base in the outfield, but he retired in the 30s.  And it's very hard to get a sense.  He's in the Hall of Fame, and we know some of his numbers.  But, you know, here's a guy that 99% of the baseball fans have never heard about.  But is Willie Mays better than Babe Ruth?  Because Babe Ruth was like a World Series pitcher.  What, did he have a two-point-something ERA?  I mean, he had a great pitcher.  He was a great pitcher in Boston. 
[01:40:30]  And with the Red Sox, and they won the World Series, I think, in 1918, and Ruth was there.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And he was like a dominant pitcher.  He was.  He was a great pitcher.  Will flew.  Correct me if I'm wrong.  Was Faye the one that was in that big controversy with the picture that was on the cover of the post, I believe it was, with the fingertips?  You know, that was a total joke, guys.  That was Bart Giamatti.  They took a picture.  Oh, it was.  And they thought it was his hand.  It turned out to be a security guy's hand. 
[01:41:00]  What about the hand?  I don't remember this.  There was a close-up picture.  Yeah.  And it showed the bulbous fingertips.  And some heart specialist came out and said that that was a sign of some type of cardiopulmonary problem.  That's right.  And Gay Talisa, I think, wrote some piece about it.  Yeah.  And it turned out it wasn't even his hand.  It wasn't even Bart's hand.  And it was a security guy's hand.  Yeah.  Was it the same color?  Yeah, same color.  And he had been checked out.  And he's still alive.  His name is Bill Carbone. 
[01:41:30]  The whole thing was a total piece of bad journalism.  It certainly was, because it was so obvious that it wasn't his hand.  And then nobody ever strained it out.  Bart was very upset about it, because it made it look as if he had some medical problem.  Yeah, it led to a heart attack.  He was so stressed out about it.  Yeah.  You know, that's the odd thing, huh?  Yeah, and it wasn't even his hand.  Wow.  How long has the present commissioner been there?  Well, he started in 93, and he's been there ever since. 
[01:42:00]  He was the acting commissioner for, I don't know, five or six years.  And so he's been there since 93.  That's 13 years.  Is it kind of incestuous that they have an owner slash commissioner?  Of course it is.  I mean, why is that allowed?  Well, they can do whatever they want, guys.  I mean, they elect.  They didn't want me there.  They wanted to see if they could break the union, so I left.  And they tried to break the union.  They failed.  And then they elected him, the commissioner, in the mid-'90s. 
[01:42:30]  And he's been there a long time.  That's true.  I'm talking about them like the Congress or the House of Representatives baseball.  Well, Congress and the House of Representatives have begun to muscle baseball, and it's probably  a good thing.  Well, your book is called The Only Game in Town, and it's like an oral history of baseball  stars from the 30s and 40s talking about the game they love.  And all proceeds are going to the Baseball Hall of Fame.  That's true, guys.  And you're very nice to talk about it.  Thank you so much for coming on the show today. 
[01:43:00]  Nice to be with you.  Thanks.  Bye, Mr. Vincent.  Thank you, Faye.  Faye Vincent, everyone.  Former Major League Baseball commissioner.  Listeners are a bunch of douchebags.  It sounds like someone threw a towel over Faye's cage.  He's an older man.  He's an older gentleman.  Yeah, he was the commissioner of baseball.  Of course.  We had to get some answers.  It was all right.  Jimmy, stop asking him questions.  I very rarely get to talk baseball.  Yeah, he's just sometimes, you know, the show is a virtual smorgasbord. 
[01:43:30]  That's right.  It's brick and crap.  I just got to listen better after the show because Ben said you want to talk to Faye Vincent.  And I was thinking, because I had too many things going on, that it's the commissioner of baseball.  Yeah, we want the commissioner of baseball on.  And I only realized this morning that it was Faye Vincent and it was the ex-commissioner of baseball.  Ex-commissioner.  And I'm like, oh, no.  It's the ex-commissioners.  At least give it three full weeks before you interview boring a-holes. 
[01:44:00]  Oh, stop.  Come on now.  And the show is called The Commish.  The Commish.  Whoever titled that show should have their feet severed.  I love Faye Vincent on The Sopranos.  I think he's got the wrong guy.  Someone needs to insert the Homer Simpson boring.  Boring.  Baseball needs new regs.  New regs.  Man.  Shut up.  All right, when we get back, the review crew. 
[01:44:30]  Man, they're at it again.  They're just terrific.  The review crew is an important force in this city.  They're talking about gas prices this morning and Newsday.  This is worth the papers printed on.  Thank God they're there for us.  We'll see what the review crew is all about in just a bit.  Opie, the Bone Crusher Hughes, plus Anthony, the Hitman, Kumia, equals Party City.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Yeah, all right.  Sounds good.  I think we're going to be on Hannity and Combs tonight. 
[01:45:00]  We're taping that today?  Are they airing it tonight or for another show this week?  When does it air?  I don't know.  We're taping tonight, Hannity and Combs.  Taping Hannity and Combs.  So we talked to a...  Is Combs there when we're there?  I hope not.  I don't know.  He's just a dummy.  I like talking to Hannity.  Mr. Hannity.  He'll ask us all kinds of serious questions about shock jockery. 
[01:45:30]  Yeah, you talk to Hannity and Combs is just there to nod a lot.  Nod.  Nod.  Throw out some liberal...  Nod.  Nod.  Shrivel.  Nod.  I disagree.  Nod.  Nod.  Nod.  Disagree.  Nod.  Nod.  Nod.  Disagree.  But guys, don't you...  No.  No.  Shut up, stupid.  Let's go to John in Miami.  John, what's up?  Hey.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Jimmy, I thought you did a great job interviewing Faye Vinson.  Thank you.  It was the highlight of the show today.  Of the week.  Yeah, but...  I mean, I know you were chomping at the bit to throw Ramon in there or something, but... 
[01:46:00]  Well, Jimmy's actually looking at the book and he's found a few other chapters  that we should have discussed with Faye Vinson.  Oh.  It was actually pretty interesting.  There's a really cool chapter here about the 30s.  It's called Get Out of the Locker Room, Nigger, which is a pretty good chapter on baseball  in the 30s.  Jesus.  Hey, I didn't write it.  That is not one of the chapters.  And there's a really cool one on Joe DiMaggio here where it's a really fun little subchapter.  It's called Be Quiet, You High-Falutin' Bitch, or I'll Blacken Your Other Eye. 
[01:46:30]  Lovely time in American history that was.  Really, yeah.  He picked two great decades, didn't he?  In the 30s and 40s.  40s.  Well, we had to stay at a different motel because...  Really?  Separate buses.  It must have been terrific for everybody.  Yeah.  Daniel, or Daniel...  Is there another chapter in there, though?  Uh, why do DiMaggio's fingers smell like JFK? 
[01:47:00]  I thought I saw that thumbing through.  Oh, shit.  Y'all know how to make a sick guy feel good.  Uh, Opie?  No cursing.  Amy?  Yes, sir.  Yeah.  Thanks, guys, man.  What's your sob story?  Let's get it over with.  Oh, no.  I've been sick for a while.  I've been bedridden here lately.  What's wrong with you, man?  What's wrong?  No, I have cancer, man.  Oh, stop it.  And y'all sent me an autographed picture.  Cancer doesn't give you the sniffles, sir.  And I wanted to... 
[01:47:30]  He's coughing.  Are you going to be all right?  Huh?  Are you going to be all right?  No, I'm dying.  What type do you have, sir?  I have bone cancer and I have prostate cancer.  Prostrate.  It's prostate.  Yeah, that's in your pecker.  No, it's not.  Yes, it is.  Kind of.  No, it's not.  It's in your abdomen.  Well, yeah, but it has to do with your ED and all that.  It's controlled by that, I guess.  No, it's not.  Yes, your prostate swells up. 
[01:48:00]  Do you know what the prostate...  If you had prostate cancer, wouldn't you want to know everything about the prostate?  What does your prostate do, sir?  I don't want to know nothing about it.  He doesn't want to know what it does.  What does it do?  I just want to go...  I'll tell you what it does.  He's lying.  When a doctor checks it, it ruins the jeans you're wearing.  It makes the stuff that the little tadpoles swim in.  Are you saying cancer guy is lying?  Yes, I'm saying this guy doesn't have cancer because he doesn't even know what the prostate 
[01:48:30]  does.  Cancer guy, prove you have cancer.  That's right.  You can't prove it.  Prove it.  Sound like you're in pain.  Huh?  There you go.  Prove that you have cancer, sir.  Uh, what do you want?  Do you have like a fax line or something?  You're going to fax over your prostate?  Yeah.  No, I'll just fax you the paperwork, man.  All right.  Well...  I just wanted to call and thank y'all, man.  Y'all really made my day.  Some of my mails got misplaced.  I can't listen to y'all anymore.  So my cousin's been recording y'all shows and... 
[01:49:00]  Oh, thanks.  What do you like about the show, by the way?  I just really appreciate it.  Thank you guys.  What do you like about the show, Daniel?  Oh, you are just brutal.  If he was sick, I wish him all the best.  But from his...  I wasn't buying it.  He's definitely sick.  That conversation...  How is he definitely sick?  Just like that one to God did.  Well, I'd really like to know if...  Click.  If you had prostate cancer, wouldn't you know what the prostate did and where it was located? 
[01:49:30]  Why would you want to know?  You would have to know.  The doctor would sit there and tell you.  If the doctor said you're not going to get through it.  But he's got to get to the point where he has to examine you enough to know that you're  not going to get through it.  And he's got to go through treatment and you know where it is.  All right.  Liar, liar.  Prostate on fire.  I don't know.  He might have been...  A lot of dumb people get cancer.  He might have just been dumb.  Daniel.  He might be a dummy.  Dope.  Good luck, bro.  Gee, who was the last person that Opie gave the good luck to, bro?  Who was that? 
[01:50:00]  Peter Jennings.  Peter Jennings.  That's right.  It worked so well for him.  Yeah, this side of the show hasn't heard the...  I don't know what your lung does.  I think it's part of your digestive system.  This part of the show hasn't heard the Peter Jennings story really fast.  When Peter Jennings was diagnosed with lung cancer, everyone knew it wasn't looking good.  And I was in Central Park just sitting on a bench after rollerblading or something, just  mellowing out for a few minutes.  And I see Peter Jennings coming my way with his son and his daughter.  And I'm like, oh my God, that's Peter Jennings. 
[01:50:30]  I have a lot of respect for Mr. Jennings because he was one of the guys that was pretty cool  with us when we did the Sex with Sam thing.  He had a whole piece on it on ABC Nightly News or whatever.  So here he's coming and I got at least 100 yards to think of something that I could say  to Peter Jennings in his time of need.  He's looking really frail.  He's walking with his son and daughter.  He's getting closer.  He's getting closer.  And I'm saying to myself, oh, don't blow this, don't blow this, say something, say something 
[01:51:00]  to Peter Jennings.  Something profound, something maybe helpful to him, something he'll remember, something  he can take away maybe a good feeling about for a short time because he knows he's got  terminal cancer.  Right.  So he's upon me and I said, good luck, bro.  And I pointed at my cancer bracelet that I wear in honor of Brother Wheeze in Rochester,  New York.  That was the best I could come up with was good luck, bro. 
[01:51:30]  To Peter Jennings.  Good luck, bro.  He died a month later.  That's something you say to somebody before they scratch off a lotto ticket.  Good luck, bro.  Why don't you just yell, you are, I panicked.  I panicked.  Good luck, bro.  I absolutely panicked.  Good luck, bro.  All right.  We're wrapping up the first half of the European Anthony Show.  We will continue on XM in a few minutes, starting with a walkover to XM Satellite Radio.  That happens every morning right outside this station. 
[01:52:00]  Kenny, what's up?  Miserable out.  We got a weather report.  You all right, Kenny?  No, you mentioned packing up, so I was starting to pack up.  Oh, look at him jump to it.  We have to move like somebody.  Why, why?  I'm going to pack up and move like somebody.  Is that an invitation, an impression?  It's pretty good.  It was a stupid thing I heard somewhere along my lifetime that I just repeated.  Oh, okay.  I just don't like the way he fumbled and ran to the microphone and almost tripped and hurt himself. 
[01:52:30]  Why don't you move it up, Kenny?  You're 6'8".  Why don't you lean into the mic instead of just picking it up?  Yeah, but I'm not used to being an on-air personality.  I'm behind the scenes.  But you're terrific.  How about just a personality?  Or how about an on-air lack thereof?  Isn't he terrific?  Well, you know what?  I haven't complimented you guys lately about how good this show has been doing.  Hey, Newsday.  They got this review crew.  We'll end with this today.  The review crew?  We had no idea there was a review crew until they reviewed our show after being on the air three days. 
[01:53:00]  Yeah, thank you.  Something like that.  Three or four days, they decided they needed to review our radio show already.  We didn't get bad marks.  We did okay.  We had some Cs, a couple As, B+.  It was all over the place because they had to equal it out.  Get some good reviews, some bad reviews, and some average reviews.  Something for everyone.  That's right.  So, well, the review crew, they're reviewing gas prices today in Newsday.  And they got a bunch of people that are part of the review crew. 
[01:53:30]  And they talk about the hot topic of the day.  And today it's gas prices.  And it starts with Marissa from Massapequa.  She's 24 years old.  Marissa.  With gas prices continuing to climb, we asked the review crew how they're coping.  And this is what Marissa had to say.  What?  Any fun facts?  You want the fun facts?  I sure do.  I was trying to blow off that.  No, fun facts rule.  All right.  Can't live without?  What can't Marissa live without there, Jimmy?  Her heart.  An MP3 player? 
[01:54:00]  I think the heart is a better answer.  Right.  And her Bose noise-canceling headphones.  Favorite 80s or 90s TV series?  The Nightly News?  Beverly Hills 90210.  All right.  So this is her take on the rising gas prices.  Because I work in Manhattan and commute via train, I rarely drive my car more than a few  miles a week.  But I probably won't take as many road trips over the summer as I have in the past. 
[01:54:30]  And I might consider biking to the beach rather than driving.  Cheap whore.  Although I only need to fill up two or three times a month.  Two or three times a month?  And she's complaining?  And she's thinking of biking to the beach this summer.  Yeah.  It's still a financial strain when I'm paying twice as much as I have budgeted for gas money.  What do you drive a tank?  She has a bucket.  I know, really.  How much gas do you use going to the beach?  If you can ride it on a bike, just spend the extra four dollars, chiseler. 
[01:55:00]  She has a budget.  You thought she was going to take a 92-mile bike ride to the beach.  I bet she spends more money at Starbucks.  Absolutely.  Can't live without her MP3 player.  Then you got Lindsay, 27, from Long Beach.  Where is she?  Oh, she's over there.  Okay.  Talking about the rising gas prices, the review crew, because they're just terrific.  Each mile click on my odometer elicits a wince of pain with my weekly 250 miles.  Wow, that's a lot of wincing. 
[01:55:30]  I put up with the discomfort and eye strain of my local theater instead of driving 21 miles  for the lush stadium seating in Westbury.  Drives 21 miles to a movie?  No one.  Well, when you get the stadium seats, it's worth it.  Oh, who cares?  There's still going to be annoying people yelling.  Come summer, I might walk the three blocks to my favorite sushi spot.  Good, and I hope you get food poisoning and don't make it back home.  I hope she eats a piece of salmon and has an explosion on the second block on her way home 
[01:56:00]  while she's talking to her date in white pants.  You don't like the review crew.  I hate the review crew.  I hope they all get gum cancer at the same time.  I really can't be bothered with the review crew.  She'll get cancer at the gums, and as they're giving the reviews, their teeth should just  fall out like rotted chicklets.  I mean, she's contemplating not driving three blocks.  Three blocks.  Because gas is so high.  They're looking for parking. 
[01:56:30]  Three blocks.  Walk already, lazy brud.  She's not done.  My biggest lifestyle change is resisting the urge to move my car whenever a better parking  spot opens in front of my home.  How far do you drive for parking?  What do you do, six miles for a better spot?  It's Long Beach.  Those damn gas prices.  I can't even go from the driveway across the street on Wednesday morning between nine  and noon.  For 75 cents, it's just not worth it.  Not worth her 75 cents.  Then you got Omar.  All right, all right. 
[01:57:00]  I just saw her last name.  Ah, good boy.  Ah, yes.  They are cheap.  Omar, 29, from Plainview.  Just the other day, it cost me nearly $50 to fill up.  Ouch, he writes.  And that had nothing to do with gas.  He was in a buddy booth.  Every year, they're drilling the holes smaller and smaller.  A man can't be violated while his wife thinks he's out getting milk.  What is wrong with you? 
[01:57:30]  Ouch.  Ouch.  And I might walk three blocks, Tal.  Ow, ow, ow, ow.  Yeah, a lot of people asking if we still play, what did we learn?  We can play, what did we learn on the first half of the ONA show?  Yes.  Yes, uh, Solomon Abdul Wali from Brooklyn.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Sounds like trouble.  But I don't want to, you know, stereotype. 
[01:58:00]  Looks like he wants to learn how to fly a plane.  Well, you know.  Come on.  Come on.  Omar.  Omar, 29, Plainview.  Just the other day, it cost me nearly $50 to fill up.  Ouch.  I could look at this as a major financial setback and start rationing or accept this as a slight  inconvenience and proceed with my daily life.  I'm going to bite the bullet.  Summer's almost here and I have a whole bunch of trips and activities planned.  There's no way I'm going to let something like this keep me from driving. 
[01:58:30]  Oh, I like it.  Can he bite the bullet like our bud Dwyer did?  That's right.  Then swallow it and then say, I don't want this and let it exit through the top of the  skull as you slump against the wall.  Oh, no, no.  Don't worry.  Or bite this.  I'll tell you it's a bullet.  Just cradle what's underneath it as you bite it without teeth, fella.  Bite it like this.  That doesn't look like a bullet.  Would you? 
[01:59:00]  And then finally, Dan and Malvern, 28.  I'm outraged.  I've been reduced to discretionary driving.  Yeah, discretionary driving.  Thank you, Jimmy.  Consolidating trips, using the Long Island Railroad more often.  Although I prefer larger vehicles, I sacrifice for a four-cylinder.  I'm jealous of my Manhattan friends who can laugh all the way to the subway.  Yes, as I'm being piped over the head and robbed by a gang for $7.  Exactly.  You have to pay a little extra from gas.  I'm being raped on the way to work in a suit. 
[01:59:30]  Good choice.  We've got to deal with all the perverts out there, the flashers and the molesters.  Exactly.  And all you want to do is peek to see if the train's coming.  Next thing you know, you're on the rails.  We're hungry with this couch.  Well, you've got to pay an extra few bucks.  This guy's exposing himself, trying to get a cell phone picture, not to turn over, just  to enjoy later.  Well, he's driving the four-cylinder.  Who laughs on the way to the subway?  What a guy.  We don't care about gas. 
[02:00:00]  I've never seen that happen.  A happy couple laughing.  And their suit and coattails.  Jimmy's on fire today.  You're on fire, Jimmy.  If it hits $4 a gallon, you may find me at Olive Garden scavenging for vegetable oil leftovers.  Why?  To lube up a cucumber and do the right thing with?  I hope Americans unite for gas boycotts.  Me too.  Starting with you, sir.  That'll happen. 
[02:00:30]  Quickly, I saw The Hills Have Eyes, the remake.  How was it?  And Big Bob in there is played by our favorite actor of all time, Ted Levine.  Is it Levine or Levin?  I don't know.  Ted Levine.  He's the guy that was in Silence of the Lambs.  Where'd you?  Where'd you?  Where'd you?  There is a spot in that that we need the sound clip of.  He crashes in the desert.  He's got his truck and a trailer and his family is in there.  And his son-in-law comes up and asks if he can fix it.  And the truck is obviously totaled.  He's sitting at the front tire. 
[02:01:00]  The son-in-law says, well, can you fix it?  He looks and says, what?  And just goes, what?  What?  It had me roaring.  The guy's the best ever.  Would you?  You about to sign 14.  What?  Thank you.  Need that clip.  All right.  Let's say hi to Al.  Al, what did you learn on the first half of the Opinant Show?  Hello, Al.  I learned that birds are faggots and I learned that Voss is the worst Santa ever. 
[02:01:30]  Certainly is.  Educational programming.  What segment do you think was more boring?  Tom Chiasano or Faye Vincent?  No.  Come on.  Let's be honest here.  What?  Tom Chiasano.  It was funny.  Somebody sent an instant feedback about, they said, Tom's parrot has like, oh, he's missing  one eye.  And they said, did he have a pirate on his shoulder?  Arr.  A little pirate patch on the little parrot's eyeball.  Half blind parrot.  Flying in circles. 
[02:02:00]  Annoying everyone.  Do you know they would have killed that if we didn't do it?  Well, then you should have let them do it.  Doesn't serve society.  He's a burden on society.  They adopted him.  That's nice.  That's sweet.  Well, we're done, I guess.  Yes, we are done.  For this portion of the program, we walk over now, do our XM show, but we will see you here  tomorrow.  Yeah.  Promptly at, what ungodly hour do we start at?  I don't know.  Five, four, three in the morning. 
[02:02:30]  I don't know.  Yeah, Ma.  Hang on.  Time to pack up, Kenny.  Pack our bags.  First walk in the rain.  Pack our luggage.  Is it raining really hard?  Get on the trellis.  But we'll have to get more.  Ben, get your hog ready.  We all need some shelter from the rain.  All right, we'll see you tomorrow if you're not listening for the second half of the O&A  show exclusively on XM.  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[02:03:00]  All right.  It's going to be a short walk today.  It's pouring in New York City.  Let me know when we're on the radio.  We're on the radio.  Oh, my God.  It's fucking pouring. 
[02:03:30]  I'm over here, Jimmy.  Get pulled.  Someone get a picture of Club Stodaketti in the flower umbrella.  You'd look more masculine with a cock over your head.  All right, all right.  The wind is blowing at us, and the water is hitting me in the face.  Unacceptable.  It's called rain.  I don't like it at all.  Hold my umbrella, scum.  I'm much too important for this.  We had to borrow umbrellas from the staff of Free FM.  Eric is holding mine, and I'm getting wet.  Hold my umbrella, scum.  Your umbrella's inside out, lady. 
[02:04:00]  Steve, hold my umbrella properly.  Hold my umbrella, faggot.  I'm getting wet.  Big star's coming through.  Hold my umbrella, or I'll slap your face.  People are horrified.  Yeah, all the commuters with their umbrellas.  It's very windy, too, so a lot of the umbrellas are turning inside out.  That's right.  I'm yelling at Eric, for those of you that can't see, which is everyone. 
[02:04:30]  Oh, my God, look at this.  I'm yelling at him in front of people like this.  He just yells, hold my umbrella properly, scum.  Oh, my God.  Oh, that girl was petrified.  That girl was petrified.  Where's your umbrella, man?  Where's your umbrella?  All right.  Why is Nat King Cole always out here every day?  That's not Nat.  That's Cowboy Curtis.  He's just a gentleman.  Someone tell Eric, if my knuckle gets wet again, he's fired.  By the way, Jimmy was on fire today.  Oh, yes. 
[02:05:00]  Props to Jimmy.  Thank you.  Props to Jimmy on the first half of the show today.  Absolutely.  Mac is in the rain today.  This umbrella sucks, by the way, this fucking small thing.  Why don't we get big umbrellas?  Hey, Ben, you want to share that?  Oh, my God.  Bob hairdo.  Ben's got a big umbrella in his whole head.  It takes up his whole head.  Hey, Ben, that umbrella is as big as your fucking head.  He just walks ahead of everyone.  He don't give a crap.  Oh, I'd like to kick Ben right in his cock vein. 
[02:05:30]  Do we have to say hi to Mac today?  Oh, Mac is out in the rain.  Fuck Mac.  Weren't we supposed to have a doctor coming in to check out his leg?  A doctor for Mac?  Yeah, we don't know where the doctor is.  He doesn't care.  Yeah, I don't blame him.  He's on call.  All right, let's go.  Cross the street.  Let's cross the street.  For God's sake, I'm getting wet.  I don't like getting wet.  It's wet and cold.  Hold my umbrella properly.  The city bus is...  Hellos. 
[02:06:00]  What?  Oh, well, we're right here now.  Wait, what happened?  He wants to give us a ride.  Oh, yeah, well, yeah, jump on.  All right, let's go.  We're going on the city bus.  Well, give us a ride.  Can you give us a ride?  Can you give us a ride?  All right, let's get on.  All right, we're on a city bus.  All right, welcome aboard.  Thank you, sir.  We're only going half a block.  How you doing?  Good.  Oh, this is nice.  I like buses.  Make Ben walk.  Yeah, fuck Ben.  Take my mic and interview the nice city bus driver. 
[02:06:30]  Thank you, sir.  Nice.  What's your name, driver?  Can he say no?  The driver is anonymous.  He can't say his name.  And don't stand in front of the yellow line, Kenny.  By the way, the bus stopped, messed up all the traffic.  Everyone's yelling and screaming just so he could pick us up.  He's a huge fan of the show.  Oh, that's nice.  Oh, we're at our destination.  And here we are.  Thank you, sir.  All right, that was great.  I ruled.  The city bus driver just drove us 100 feet. 
[02:07:00]  Thank you.  Do we got any stickers?  Give that man some stickers and whatever else he wants.  That's right.  Kenny, give him a blowjob.  Give him what he wants.  All right, let's get.  Thank you.  Inside here.  Walk me.  Walk me so I don't get wet.  Walk me, scumbag.  I don't want to get wet.  Only poor people should get wet.  All right, it's a short one today.  Terrible.  That was so funny.  That bus ride was eight seconds long.  It was literally 100 feet. 
[02:07:30]  He stopped traffic to pick us up to drive us 100 feet.  We had an entire city bus for a 100-foot ride.  All right, the second half of the Opie and Anthony show starts in moments.  Opie and Anthony.  Where the fuck am I?  The fuck is it?  Disgusting.  Sexual.  Parents say it is not for kids.  Pornography in the workplace.  We played on TV screens for drawings.  They ran back and took off with a family car.  People making nasty comments about women.  Virus is spreading in our area. 
[02:08:00]  Find out where.  Racial language and racist attacks.  Push the button!  Don't be it, Anthony!  I'm a black ninja, fuckface!  All right, we remember.  Shut up.  We smoke pot with Snoop Doggy Dogg on a daily basis.  You're talking out your ass.  Just give me some action today.  I'm going to crap myself.  Oh, what a log you're going to have.  Holy shit.  Holy shit.  Yahoo!  The Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:08:30]  Holy shit.  Yahoo!  Envy.  Oh.  With Opie.  I have psychosis.  Anthony.  I'm a xenophobic asshole.  Jim Norton.  I don't have the chops to do this.  And a bunch of zeros.  Your old man.  Ah!  Steve really is love.  Perfectly enunciating bulb.  Sorry, Steve.  E-Rock.  I bring nothing to the table.  They love when Hawk fucks up.  Shut up.  But more importantly, we see Derek's balls.  You just relax. 
[02:09:00]  Here comes the funny.  Problem, Hawk?  My cross is burning so bad.  Shut up!  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  He's just getting a little fucking manic.  He's just getting a little fucking manic. 
[02:09:30]  Ha ha ha ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha ha.  I'm breaking your balls on you.  It doesn't matter when you're getting fucking fresh.  He's just getting a little fucking manic.  I'll go home and get your fucking shine box.  All right.  Wow.  Wowie kazowie.  It is pouring out there. 
[02:10:00]  The city bus driver was classic.  As we were crossing the street, the city bus driver was completely blocking traffic.  Yeah.  Completely.  Everyone's beeping out there.  The commuter is trying to get to their jobs with their umbrellas.  Really pissed because they can't walk up onto the sidewalk.  Yeah.  And all of a sudden he opens up his window and starts calling us.  We're like, what?  It turns out it's the guy that beeps every morning when we do the walkover.  Yeah.  This is his bus route, obviously.  And he said, jump on.  I thought there were people on the bus.  I guess he's off duty or whatever and decided to swing back to get us. 
[02:10:30]  Empty bus.  So we jumped on and we just took a city bus maybe, maybe a hundred feet.  That was the shortest bus ride ever.  I was going to tell him to go around the block, but I guess we would have lost the signal  or something, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Unfortunately.  At that point, we should have got on our cell phones and did a city block with the city  bus driver.  Yeah.  Because nothing bad's ever happened with that.  Being on the bus, talking on the cell phone.  That'll always work that well on the show.  Yeah.  Why not?  I didn't like it.  All right.  The Pal Talk cameras are up and rolling. 
[02:11:00]  There they go.  And when are we getting the Pal Talks for the first half of the O&A show?  I don't know.  They're working on the computer.  I got the program on one of the computers, but for some reason you can't log on to it.  It's just one of those things.  It's the whole thing.  We're working on it.  Once we have it, it will rule.  That's all I can tell you, people.  All right.  That's all I can tell you.  But we're here.  Second half.  I'm punching up all the usual suspects here.  Any chicks, man?  I want to see some chicks.  That's all I pop up here. 
[02:11:30]  I want to see some girls.  I want to look at guys.  Who's that?  Baby girl?  She's lovely.  You got baby girl.  You got...  Where's happy typing girl?  Well, happy typing girl goes up.  Someone said you could see her hiney in sweatpants that she was wearing yesterday.  I didn't see it, but they said her hiney looked very good.  She wears tight sweatpants.  Ooh.  Little tight sweat slacks.  Then we got a little...  Oh, and you got that mess.  Let me see.  We put a little up there.  Not dead.  Yeah.  There you go. 
[02:12:00]  Who else?  Who am I missing?  Oh, shit.  God damn it.  She's awful.  How about...  Where's Red Rum?  Open Red Rum.  I like her.  Where's...  Oh, there she is.  Don't you ever argue with her.  Oh, Silly Goose.  Got to have Silly Goose up there.  There she is.  Boink.  Open Red Rum.  All right.  Red Rum.  No, she has clothes on.  It bothers me.  I don't like clothed women.  Where the hell is she, Jimmy?  I don't know. 
[02:12:30]  She's on the list, Anthony.  God's out of my ranga.  Where is she?  Hawk has her open.  All right.  Well, we did everything we wanted to do on the first half of the show.  Yeah, that's right.  So let's just wing it for a little while.  We'll wing it for a little while.  Let's do some half-assed nonsense.  I think we did out of here early today.  Shit, shit, fuck, fuck, shit.  There we go.  That's what everyone seems to be looking for anyway.  I want to crucify some of those asses on the message boards.  A whack bag.  They made me go home and made me actually post. 
[02:13:00]  I posted a while back and said, I'm done with you until June.  And I've posted 800 times since I made that post because they annoy me so much.  People get so pissed off.  Well, hope you enjoyed the watered-down version of the show because now you'll get this show.  And then hope you enjoy the replay schedule because no matter how we do the replay,  someone is ultra pissed about it, and we're doing it personally to piss you off.  And, of course, Ron and Fez are getting screwed on the replay, and I posted last night. 
[02:13:30]  Of course they are.  You figured it out.  It's because we hate Ron and Fez.  I posted this last night.  I go, the weekends, we play the same shit from Opie and Anthony over and over again  instead of playing Ron and Fez because the secret's out now.  We hate Ron and Fez.  Why?  They are not our friends.  We cannot stand them because that's what they want to hear.  That's what these listeners that bitch all the time want to hear.  I don't hate Ron and Fez. 
[02:14:00]  Of course not.  Of course we don't, Jimmy.  It's Fez I hate.  I was just at the, well, one of them.  I hate Fez.  I was just at their party on Saturday night.  I hate his kind.  I had a great time.  What do you mean, a faggot?  I hate his kind.  A homosexual?  We don't know if he is.  Is that official?  I don't think he's gay.  I don't know.  We don't know.  He's so good at the act.  Who knows?  I don't think he's gay.  I think that he just kind of digs cock a little.  I think Ronnie's the faggot.  That's right. 
[02:14:30]  And they switched it up.  He does like smoking those big cigars.  He smokes those cigars.  That's right.  That's a little phallic.  And then when he smokes them, he just doesn't smoke it.  He deep throats it down to the ash and then brings it back up.  He's not happy unless he's smoking a cigar and tearing out of one eye at the same time.  Bennington.  There's Bennington and a peanut popper.  Say it out, sir.  Well, let's stay ahead of time in Boston.  Jim Norton had a killer show at the Orpheum up in Boston.  And then he did the same thing in Atlantic City the next day. 
[02:15:00]  Thank you.  And I'll be doing the same thing at the Stress Factory Memorial Day weekend.  Friday, Saturday, Sunday.  Oh, good.  What's up?  Hey, Jimmy.  I'm sorry you had such a bad show.  Bad time in the hallway Friday night with the guy from the souvenir stand.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That guy gave us a hard time, man.  But my wife was the one that came up to you and said she had a little dream.  And she said she sent you a picture.  Did you get it?  I don't know if I got the picture.  She did say...  I think she said she had...  Oh, did we take the picture that night?  Yeah. 
[02:15:30]  I'll have to address that when I get home.  Because the girl told me she had a sexual dream about me.  Oh, yeah.  Which is very rare.  I think she's going to send you a nice picture so you could pound a few out to it.  Oh, no.  I did not get that yet.  Tell her to send immediately.  You kicked ass Friday night.  It was a great show.  And I can't wait until you come back.  Thanks, buddy.  All right.  Yeah, me and Dave are going to try to do some more dates together.  Maybe hit Cleveland and a few other cities.  Cool.  Neil in New York City.  Neil?  Yeah.  What's going on, guys?  Hey.  Hi, Neil.  I love you, firstly.  I just put out...  You guys are doing a great job.  Congratulations on all your success.  Thank you, you fucking wanker. 
[02:16:00]  Yeah, I am a wanker.  I am.  Listen, I just want to voice my opinion.  I love you and I look forward to the weekend just as much as everyone else does.  But it does appear that it's repetitive, very repetitive, and also there doesn't seem to  be any one of those out there, so...  Why is it repetitive?  Is it a three-hour block?  It was supposed to be like an eight-hour block.  I don't know.  I know.  It was supposed to be an eight-hour block of programming on the weekend that they rotate.  I know it's fucked up. 
[02:16:30]  That's what I know.  I know things are being dealt with, worked on, and planned.  And that's all people can know.  Yeah, it's a work in progress.  Work in progress.  Not the final thing that is going to be.  Yeah, I was going to say, is there any way we could just replay the actual shows?  I mean, you know, we miss out on shows occasionally, and I think the listeners would really appreciate  it.  Take the fag.  I've got to go.  Listen, good job, guys. 
[02:17:00]  Really.  Take the fag and just put the fag in your mouth.  Now suck.  Suck on that fag.  Didn't he sound exactly like one of the fag?  Wait, you mean like, he's saying replay all the shows from the leak, like play Monday,  Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.  And just back-to-back, let it roll.  Yeah.  We figured we'd highlight some of our better stuff of the week.  Is that a bad idea, though, the replay on the show?  Just like you missed seeing this Thursday.  Yes, it is, Jimmy.  Yes, it is.  But I want to say it might be a good idea.  All I know is people heard the Frank Vincent interview like three times over the fucking weekend.  Not necessary. 
[02:17:30]  Not necessary.  Hawk, better have an answer.  It was both parts.  Lies!  There's two three-hour shows that run, and then Ron and Fez reruns.  Uh-huh.  So you got the CBS portion, the XM portion.  Weren't we doing eight-hour blocks?  No, six hours.  Man, I don't know, whatever.  Ah, see?  See?  See?  I did ask for eight.  But either way, even if it's six or eight, why don't we just replay?  That's not a bad idea that Nigel had.  Why don't we replay the shows, like, off in the week? 
[02:18:00]  Kate, let's just say Sunday happened.  Say there was a misunderstanding with a youngster.  You have to go to court.  You missed Tuesday's show.  Right.  Now you can hear it.  You can hear it.  Although they replay it all day Tuesday.  Where's the problem?  Uh, whatever.  And then Friday's show replays Sunday, a couple days after Friday.  Satellite ain't like regular radio.  I don't think we should concentrate so much on the details of this being played more times than that.  Just play the fucking show.  I've heard the CBS portion of the show played, and then filler being played, and then the second half of the show. 
[02:18:30]  Because I was the one bitching going, why are we playing XM portion first, and then the CBS portion?  So now we're referencing things that we did in the morning, and no one knows what the fuck we're talking about.  So I think it was Elo said, yeah, you know something?  We've got to play the shows all at one, you know, in order.  And I go, that's exactly what I said.  So they played the CBS portion of the show, and then instead of going right into this, because they've got to take up time when they take the commercials out, 
[02:19:00]  they played filler, and then this portion.  So you're still missing what the fuck happened earlier.  And guess what the filler is?  What?  Well, the filler is played during the most important hour of afternoon drive radio.  Right.  But there's not a brain to be had in Washington that could figure that out on their own.  Play the show in the order it's fucking played.  I was writing emails all weekend long, like, is there one fucking brain in Washington that understands radio, 
[02:19:30]  that understands Radio 101, that you want to put your best foot forward every afternoon?  So if you're in your car driving home from 5 to 6, you don't want replays in that time slot.  That's the most listened to part of afternoon drive.  So we should have either, we should have the latest material.  Yes.  But instead, there's most days, because I checked it out myself, most days there's, like, O&A filler from, like, 5.30 to 6. 
[02:20:00]  That's just plain stupid.  It is stupid.  Someone needs to go to the Connecticut School of Broadcasting and learn how to do radio before they try to figure things out.  Right.  But I had to bring that to everyone's attention.  I had to do it.  But with the show being shrunk down because they're not replaying all the filler stuff from the morning, how long?  Don't be an Anthony on steroids in the afternoon.  No, no.  Okay, how long does that come to, though?  The two hours or something on XM?  Because that might time out to being pretty close to four hours.  They're knocking out at least 20 minutes of show, which would be the commercials when we're on, you know, the CBS stations. 
[02:20:30]  Good idea.  You don't have to sit through long breaks to get back to us doing that day's show.  But the Brainiacs then decided, well, after that show's over, to fill, fill, fill, fill, and then play what we do here.  Totally ruining any continuity of this program to people that only listen in the afternoon.  Believe it or not, there are people that only listen in the afternoon.  They don't hear us in the morning. 
[02:21:00]  We're an afternoon show for them.  So they listen, and now they're hearing the show hacked up into pieces, thrown together in willy-nilly order.  This is what I suggested.  Opie and Anthony on steroids at Afternoon Drive, right?  When that show ends, if it's a little short because they've got to fill three-hour blocks or something like that.  Yeah.  So let's say it goes two and a half hours, right?  At that point, start the XM fucking show.  Start the XM show.  And then at the end of the XM show, if you want to fill, fill, fill to get to the end of the block, fine, and then start the replay again.  You can't split the show in half and not have it connecting. 
[02:21:30]  You can't fill the middle with shit that we're doing with filler stuff.  No matter how good it is, it's ruining the continuity.  Because then you're listening to the second half of the show that we do here at XM, and you have no reference of what we did minutes earlier at CBS.  And how about stopping with the three-hour block shit?  Figure that out.  You would think they could figure that out.  Somebody.  It's so easy.  Fix it.  Fix it.  Because I'm tired of cursing people out on whack bag, especially when I get defensive, because I know they're right. 
[02:22:00]  Fuckers.  It annoys me to no end.  Is the BlackBerry ringing?  No.  Are you getting an email?  Are you sending an email?  I was going to tell you the email I sent, but whatever.  Because then there was a second suggestion I made.  What was it?  Just freaking replay it as it is then, with the filler material.  So at least they're getting some new show.  At least they're getting some new show, and they're getting it in order. 
[02:22:30]  Right.  In chronological order.  For the love of God.  I'm hoping by the time we celebrate our second anniversary at XM, we may have people that know how to do radio help us out.  Actually doing it.  That would be wonderful.  That would be a dream come true.  Please.  Yeah, between four and six, there should be no filler.  You know, like showing up at an appearance on Friday and everything works.  That would help, boys.  What happened Friday?  I was in Boston last night.  Oh, Jimmy.  Boy, did I get an email from Elo with a few people CC'd, and he was none too happy, let me tell you. 
[02:23:00]  No, I know.  I mean, too happy.  Mad at you guys?  No.  No, here's the problem.  Elo is a radio brain.  He knows radio like his cock.  Oh.  That's right.  But he's too busy running.  Sweet and delicious.  That's all with shit on it.  But he's basically too busy running the entire company.  Bad haircut over it.  He's too busy running the entire company, and he still has to deal with the Opie and Anthony show in 202.  Has to. 
[02:23:30]  Has to.  So, we show up at this appearance on Friday, Jimmy.  Nothing's working.  I'm like, why are we even here then?  Why couldn't someone be smart enough to tell us, wow, we're not even set up for a broadcast.  Maybe we should go back to the station.  Unbelievable.  Bill Burr had some great funny lines on what was going on for a half an hour at least.  And we didn't even know what he was on with us.  Bill Burr was completely off.  Bill Burr was there, talking, working, killing to nobody. 
[02:24:00]  My headphones had a loose connection.  So, when it was pushed all the way in, it was like tinny in one ear, way in the background.  So, we had to like have it halfway out.  It's just not how you do radio.  My mic, it was a headset mic, only worked when I took my index finger, pushed it against it, so it was in my mouth.  And then I was able to talk, but I had to talk with the mic being pushed like a millimeter away from my mouth.  Could you guys hear Bill? 
[02:24:30]  Like, you guys could hear Bill, but he wasn't on?  No.  All of a sudden, I think he said something like, is this thing even on?  Is this thing on?  We thought he wasn't getting big laughs.  We thought he was just being quiet.  Right.  We had no idea.  And then the phones weren't even hooked up and ready to go.  It was just a disaster.  And then on top of it, 30 people showed up.  Yeah.  The reason?  Because we didn't market it.  The promos only started a couple days before we even did the appearance.  I don't know what that was about, but add that to your list, D-Lo.  Because I know he's chewing out some asses today. 
[02:25:00]  It doesn't matter.  How about, we love XM, but just no more appearances.  You know, D-Lo, business before pleasure.  I said it in my email.  No, let's see.  No more appearances.  What, you said no more?  No.  Wasn't there something that was kind of set up?  And I just saw Opie's big capital letters.  No.  Oh, well, they want us to do, uh, they want us to do something with Korn this summer at 
[02:25:30]  Jones Beach.  No.  I've loved Korn for many, many years.  And I, we did one of the first interviews with Korn.  We go way back with this band.  They want to do a whole show revolved around, you know, our program at Jones Beach.  We would do stage announcements, give away a shitload of tickets, broadcast live.  And I just wrote, no.  No.  No.  Because we can't handle anything.  We can't handle anything outside this studio.  You think we'll get badly, badly handled?  I think so.  There's something about when we leave the studio here that just, I, I don't. 
[02:26:00]  I don't even know anymore.  Let me see.  I'm trying to find this stupid email.  I'm reading the paper.  Hold on a minute.  Yeah.  I'm just going to read Pal Talk.  You read Pal Talk.  You read email.  I read the paper.  You read that.  Hawk, say something.  Let's see.  Mm-hmm.  I can't stop looking at this chimney guy and his awful, he, he looks like Logan.  He looks like Eric Logan with that hairdo.  Oh, what paper is he in? 
[02:26:30]  He's in the Daily News.  No, he's in the Daily News, page seven.  Anyone, open up your workbooks and look at Eric Logan, this little diminutive fella with  an awful hairdo.  Why are you calling him Eric Logan?  Look at the hairdo on him.  He's Elo.  Looks like Elo, if he had fallen flat on his face and his nose spread out from ear to ear.  I'm just thinking of the hairdo.  The hairdo is definitely an Elo hairdo.  Here's the email, by the way, about the corn thing.  Oh, yeah.  It's all laid out how great this would be.  Sales is into it.  The band's into it. 
[02:27:00]  The venue's into it.  Labor Day weekend.  I need to wrap this deal up with them soon.  Bullet points.  Co-brand the Family Values Tour as your summer or back-to-school radio festival.  Offer events sponsorship to key advertisers.  500 tickets to give away.  Receive, oh, really?  Oh, wait.  Receive revenue sharing.  We might have to rethink this.  Live broadcast from backstage. 
[02:27:30]  Meet and greets with the band.  Station vehicle on site.  Let me know what you guys think, right?  So I write.  Let's see.  I just like the capital letters and exclamation points.  So I write, until I can feel like we have our shit together as far as marketing an event and  doing a live remote, I say, no!  No!  Goodbye to your idea, sir.  Good day.  Goodbye.  Was this event marketed properly?  Which one?  The one that you guys just did? 
[02:28:00]  Yes.  Absolutely not.  Absolutely not.  No.  And, you know, they're trying to say, well, the venue, meaning RCS, wouldn't let them in  until 8 o'clock.  And you need a little time to set up a live remote.  Then why do it?  Why not tell RCS to go fuck its mother and not do it?  How about this?  How about this, Jimmy?  All right.  Know that, maybe find out ahead of time that you're not going to be able to get in until  8.  They found out the day of the event.  Because I guess the XM guys went there and door shut. 
[02:28:30]  Nope.  Sorry.  We're not open until 8 or whatever.  We can't let you in until 8.  How about you find out all those details ahead of time?  There were people inside that wouldn't let them in?  I don't know that part of it.  But I just know that XM couldn't get in until 8 to set up the remote.  And you definitely need more than, you know, an hour.  An hour to set up and make sure things work?  Of course you do.  And then we get there.  And it was an embarrassment, once again, for us because there's 30 people there.  We look like idiots.  I think the show's a little bigger than having 30 people show up at an event.  Matter of fact, when we did RCS last year, there were a couple hundred easily. 
[02:29:00]  Easily.  Yeah.  And so when you go, well, 30 people are here.  Hmm.  A, we either stink.  Or B, it wasn't promoted properly.  C, both.  So then I asked around and I found out that, what, the promo started on Tuesday, Wednesday,  something like that?  You look like assholes right now, man.  Hello, exactly.  Well, I say no more appearances.  I want to do that corn thing, though.  No, ma. 
[02:29:30]  I'm not doing it.  I think it'd be, what is it, Labor Day?  It's Labor Day weekend.  That's a few months from now.  I'm going to be out of town.  We're not going to look like idiots in front of 15,000 people.  Sorry.  This ain't happening.  Nope.  All right.  Nope.  How about you start by figuring out how to make the replay work?  Yeah.  Let's take baby steps here.  Baby steps.  We'll start there.  It amazed me when I was listening to Friday because people were emailing me going, do you  realize in the most important hour of afternoon drive there's crap?  Meaning, you know, it's stuff they've heard already or data material, all that. 
[02:30:00]  I'm like, you got to be kidding me.  So I said, I checked that out myself.  Sure enough.  Sure enough.  A lot of the five o'clock hour was replays instead of that day show.  Who should be looking after that?  I don't even want to mention.  People on our end, people on their end too.  Both ends.  We should have to just worry about doing five and a half hours of radio a day.  That's a big enough chore for us.  Yeah.  There's people that were hired because supposedly they have some kind of talent. 
[02:30:30]  And all I know is I've written emails that have said the continuity of the show should  not be broken up.  We need to play the show in the order that it is broadcast or it is stupid.  And right after another, I don't give a shit about three hours of three hour blocks of  programming.  Right.  If the first half ends two and a half hours, then start the second half right there.  It's got to start there.  And make up the time at the end of it.  Or put me, how about this?  From three to three 30.  If you have to put filler in like, you know, or, or, or best of stuff to cover a break, 
[02:31:00]  do it right there or something, do it once in the beginning and then fucking at the very  end.  So people don't have to be bogged down with it when they're trying to hear the, you  know what it, once we, once we leave CBS, we have to broadcast that show here, then  the walk and then this, right?  That's how it's got it.  And without anything in between mucking up the flow of this program.  And then at the end of the show, if you need filler to get to the next replay, then  so be it.  Put it at the end. 
[02:31:30]  So be it.  That's, that's radio one-on-one to me, but, uh, right.  And I've emailed that.  So on our end, it's been covered.  They know how I feel about it.  They know how Opie feels about it.  But radio one-on-one is a college course and the, and they're stuck in like a preschool  down there still.  So I thought they were Doogie Howser's and they were able to, you know, figure out college  shit at an early age.  No, they're eating paste and shitting themselves.  Interesting story about Doogie Howser.  One of my earliest jokes.  I used to say, I know what you're thinking.  Looks like Sinead O'Connor and Doogie Howser had a kid together.  Oh, you didn't do the, this and this had a kid together. 
[02:32:00]  I did.  Well, he started that trend though, so it's okay.  No, he didn't.  It should have been A and Z had a kid together.  Doogie.  So after Friday's appearance, after Friday's appearance, I don't even want to mention his  name anymore because, you know, it's that point.  He goes, you know, it was a little rough the first half hour, but I got to tell you, you  guys did a great radio show.  And I looked at him, I go, of course we did a great radio show.  But instead of, I go, that's what we do. 
[02:32:30]  That's why, that's why we get paid the money.  That's why we're now on the CBS stations.  He looked at me surprised that we were able to pull it out of our ass.  I'm like, you know how many times we've pulled out radio shows out of our ass?  Because people behind the scenes don't know what the fuck they're doing.  I have audio of what he said to that.  He's just kid a little fucking manners.  Like he was impressed that we were able to pull a radio show out of our asses. 
[02:33:00]  I'm like, dude, we've been doing this for our entire career because we've never had  people that could keep up with us.  Never.  And what was that?  And then he goes, and then he tries to, you know, give me an excuse and I just go, I  have nothing to say.  I got a compliment.  It's gotten to the point now, I just go, I really have nothing to say.  You come up with your excuses as much as you want, but I have nothing to say.  I got a compliment.  What?  He does these impersonations. 
[02:33:30]  I swear you would think it was the real people.  Wait, now, when Ope was rude.  Yeah, yeah.  And just didn't seem to have any manners.  What was the response to that?  Teach this kid a little fucking manners.  A little fucking manners.  Teach this kid a little fucking manners.  Teach this kid a little fucking manners.  I'm breaking your balls right away, you're getting fucking fresh.  I'm breaking your balls right away, you're getting fucking fresh.  Fucking fresh.  Jim, at one point, I don't think I've ever done this in my broadcast career, and there's 
[02:34:00]  pictures of this on a whack bag.  I decided not, I said I'm not broadcasting.  And I put my hood on, I had a hoodie on, and I just turned around, the crowd is waiting  for us to do a show.  I turned around and stared out the window.  Yeah.  Just took a little look out the window for a while.  But he comes up to me, man, besides all the technical problems, you guys really had a  good show, did we?  Of course we did.  There's no reason there should not have been a lot of people there.  The show is long beyond having a small group show up. 
[02:34:30]  Bill Burr goes, why are you guys even here?  I was embarrassed in front of my-  Bill Burr turned to me and said, he goes, you guys, dude, aren't you guys-  Bigger than this?  Bigger than this?  He goes, I'm bigger than this.  And we got to sit there and go like-  Don't get me wrong.  We like doing live broadcasts.  Absolutely.  But there shouldn't be 30 people showing up.  No.  If there's 30 people showing up-  There's a problem. 
[02:35:00]  It's not our problem.  That means something is fucked up behind the scenes.  Let me tell you something.  In AC, there was about 2,500 people was the sellout for the event center, and it was full.  And little things like, and I did that to somebody, I said, right away, he's getting fucking fresh.  And probably 1,500 of them fucking cheered and went crazy.  This show has a lot of people listening to it.  Of course.  Wah, wah, stop your fucking crying and do a radio show.  We are paying to hear you cry like little bitches.  We are doing a radio show.  We had a new laugh in there.  It's Phil K.  In Pennsylvania, who, by the way, is getting banned right now. 
[02:35:30]  Good.  Phil-  What is that?  One L?  Yeah.  Phil K 0731, AOL.com, 0731.  We already-  Okay.  Wow, wow, wow.  You are now banned.  Thank you.  We already did our radio show.  That's right.  This is called Hangout Time.  That's right.  This is called Fuck Around.  This is the real watered-down version of the show.  Next time, you're going to have a business meeting on the air.  Let us know ahead of time so we can tune in to Bob Edwards. 
[02:36:00]  This is getting old, bit, bit, bit, ban, ban, ban.  Bye, bye, bye.  You are so done.  I like talking like this.  Of course it's getting old.  It does-  It's-  You think it's not getting old for us, you asshole?  That's the point we're trying to make.  That is the point we're making.  New Mexico, you drunken fucking Indian.  Die.  Cross the hot street, half drunk, fall in the middle, and let a tractor trailer run you over.  There's a bit. 
[02:36:30]  Did you see the pictures of me?  Yeah, I did.  There's a photo of Ope just looking out the window.  What is it?  With my arms folding.  Bill's looking out the window.  I'm just drinking some water and doing nothing.  Because I'm so sick of, like, winging it.  So sick.  But, you know, besides the technical problems, you guys had a really good show here, did we?  See, the thing is, people don't understand, we want to do events, and we want to do fucking good things when the listeners show up.  We love-  I honestly got, man, I love hanging with the listeners. 
[02:37:00]  I know it sounds, like, really cheesy and pandering, but I really do dig hanging with those drunken savages.  I went out Saturday night to the Ron and Fez thing they had in the city.  Hanging out with listeners, drinking some Guinness, hanging out with Ron and Fez.  Had a great time.  Had a pisser.  That's what it's about.  Not sitting there in front of equipment that's not working, and 30 people trying to squeeze a show out of your ass.  That's right.  And we made just an awful impression, RCS. 
[02:37:30]  I don't think we're going back there.  Do we have any prep sheets in here?  Last year, they were like, oh my god, oh my god, whatever you want in the store, just have.  Just take whatever you want on the way out.  They were so happy.  This time was like-  There were hundreds of people.  They just kind of nodded at us as we left.  Nodded.  I was so embarrassed.  Yep.  But you know, guys, besides the fact-  Shut up.  It's never been marketed.  Shut up.  So why do events?  How about this?  No more fucking events.  Enough already with the events and the travel getting fucked up.  Silly.  Let's go to Chopper.  Hang on, there weren't enough umbrellas.  I got droplets on my knuckles. 
[02:38:00]  Let's go to Chopper in Toronto.  Opie, I got to say, man, I bow to you.  Everything that you said has been bang on, every beef that I've had with the show.  You guys put on a great show, and then all this other technical bullshit just screws it  up.  It makes it boring on the weekends.  I miss some shows through the week and like to catch up on the weekends, and I can't.  I miss half of it.  It sucks.  But you're banged, I'm in, and I love you, Opie. 
[02:38:30]  I did ask for eight-hour blocks, too.  I know I did, for the weekend.  Absolutely, I did.  They should just replay every show.  It won't get boring.  You can catch what you missed.  Whatever.  That's the way it should work, but I don't know.  Three-hour blocks?  Fix that.  Let's say hi to the bus driver that drove us 100 feet to XM today.  Bus driver.  Friendly fella.  How you doing?  Soon to be fired.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  What's in this?  Hey, thanks for that.  Just for the sake, glad I could help out.  Yeah, right on, man.  You're the guy that drives by us every morning when we do the walkover, right? 
[02:39:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, very cool.  I have been out at Port Authority, then I try to make it up there for the walkover.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Well, next time, maybe pick us up in front of the building.  Yeah, in front of the goddamn...  On this other side of me.  Wait, wait, wait.  I was in front of the building.  I whistled at you guys, but you kept on walking.  Because we're handsome, sir.  People always whistle at us.  I want to see you make a U-turn in the middle of 57th and drive us back to the studio.  I hear you guys.  All right.  Just wanted to say, glad I could help out.  I hope to see Jimmy down in New Brunswick in a couple weeks. 
[02:39:30]  You will.  Thanks, buddy.  Come on down.  Make sure you get in.  Where?  Since we're bitching a little here, a little bitch session when we first get in.  Something missing from in front of me that is usually here.  Purell?  Something smooth.  Something E.  The dump sheet.  No, a dump sheet.  Where is that?  Do you want a smoothie?  There it is.  Yes, I wanted a smoothie.  I always get a smoothie.  Where is that big idiot?  Just right behind you.  No.  Not that big idiot.  He's the fat idiot. 
[02:40:00]  Oh.  Where's the big idiot?  Oh, he's in there on this computer.  Kenny.  Oh, Kenny.  Where is my smoothie?  Where is the smoothie the boss wants?  I'm sorry.  I was laxed in my duties today.  Lax?  Yeah, you were falling asleep on the couch, by the way.  I was reading that thing.  No, you weren't.  You were making believe you were reading because you needed some shut eye.  That's right.  If you were doing something more important than getting my smoothie, I will pardon you.  But what were you doing?  It's not too hard to do a radio show when one of your biggest supporters is on the couch snoozing, 
[02:40:30]  by the way.  At least admit that your eyes were getting heavy.  They were getting heavy because I was reading something very boring, but I did have a lack  of sleep this weekend because I had a very exciting weekend with little Jimmy.  Well, if these excursions with Jimmy are going to make you come in here and forget your  responsibilities, like getting me a smoothie, and now don't spit in it because I'll know.  I'll know.  I would never.  And don't put that big cock in mine unless you want to. 
[02:41:00]  All right.  I apologize, sir.  I will go and fetch one right now.  Well, sorry it doesn't get my bowels moving, does it, son?  Can I get my smoothie?  I don't see the smoothies being gotten.  All right.  Three smoothies.  Same as always.  You know what?  It'll be my treat.  All right.  All right.  Skim with protein.  That's right.  For me, too.  I want to be stoked.  Three times.  Same.  Same.  All right.  I want a body like Opie's.  I'll be back in a flash.  All right.  Now get the fuck out.  Be good.  And I want pretzels, too, fella.  All right.  My tummy hurts. 
[02:41:30]  Why the mood change?  Huh?  Why the mood change at nine o'clock?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Well, here's the dump sheet for the day.  I would like a prep sheet.  A prep sheet?  Just to have, like, some idea.  We have a prep sheet in front of us.  Did you hear E-Rock?  It's coming.  You're getting nothing.  It's 940.  Shouldn't it have been here 40 minutes ago?  No.  He got on you, man.  He goes, it's coming.  Like, he's all mad.  But I want it now. 
[02:42:00]  What?  Sam has it.  It'll be here in a second.  Well, tell that fucking androgynous wave to get in here.  That genderless little zilch with his fucking little bouffon hairdo.  Teach this kid a little fucking manners.  That always cheers me right up.  I love that guy.  Teach this kid a little fucking manners.  Well, here's the dump sheet.  No, no, no.  What?  What?  We played the thing first.  Oh, there's a thing.  That's right.  Live from the Opie and Anthony Show Studios, the Daily Dump Report. 
[02:42:30]  Well, we have one dump for the whole day.  I'm surprised.  Only one dump.  We went through some very good material today.  Hit on some risque subject matter.  Yet only one dump.  And it came from a caller.  Not even anybody in studio.  Congratulations, staff.  At 8.36 a.m., a caller said,  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  And I heard him say that. 
[02:43:00]  He stepped on me with that.  Oh, shit.  And obviously it was picked up by the dump guy.  I actually had my only funny line that I said as he was saying,  Oh, shit.  I remember now.  Really?  Yep.  And that's when it was dumped.  I had nothing today.  That's not true.  Jimmy was terrific.  Remind me to tell you this story.  I went to another spa when I was at the Borgata.  I went down to the spa and I had no bathing suit.  Why do you conveniently end up in these spas without the right things? 
[02:43:30]  And you know, because based on the last few times,  that something is going to happen if you do this.  Jimmy's doing oopsies.  Yeah.  Oopsie again.  Jimmy's doing oopsies.  No, no, no.  Oopsie yet again.  Forgot my bathing suit.  Might as well go in nude.  Oops.  We drove from Boston late at night to get down to Atlantic City.  Made great time in like six hours, which is really good for Boston.  Borgata has a spa that opens at 7 in the morning. 
[02:44:00]  So I wanted to get some steam before I went to bed.  Just better for the breathing.  Clear.  Clear out the stuff.  Kenny offered me his bathing suit, which is just fucking creepy.  So I said no.  Knows what's in there.  I went down.  Big mustache.  Fuck.  Semen leaking out like where the back is.  I went downstairs.  Into a...  I went down to the area, the steam area.  The spa.  And I checked in.  In front of me, they give you a robe.  I can't look at a robe now without just giggling. 
[02:44:30]  Can't put one on.  I was at the hotel over the weekend.  I put on a robe to get the door for room service.  And I'm just like, I open the door and go, uh-huh, uh-huh.  And he doesn't get the joke.  Just gives me my broth.  I put my robe on.  I went into the steam room.  I cleared myself out a little bit.  It was kind of...  I had a towel on.  I was nude.  But I always put a towel on.  And then opened my legs much farther than necessary.  Oopsie.  While another gentleman is sitting across from me.  Yeah.  Jimmy and his oopsies.  So I get into the whirlpool, which was not hot, by the way. 
[02:45:00]  There's no one in there but me.  There was some guys in the steam room.  There was guys in the area sleeping.  Bums.  These gambler idiots.  So I'm sitting there naked in the whirlpool.  And I was looking down at my legs and my hairless cock.  And I had to get out.  I looked like the cover of our Nirvana record.  I was disgusted with myself.  Someone put a dollar bill on a hook trying to chase you around the pool.  I'm hairless and my cock was floating up and it looked like a baby cock. 
[02:45:30]  What?  I had to leave.  Why were you naked in there?  I didn't have a bathing suit.  There was no one in there.  There was no one in the water.  I don't care.  At some point, someone's going to get in the water.  That's not as bad as it is.  No, it's not bad at all, actually.  It's gay.  You didn't know...  What do you predict that no one's going to come in?  Well, when they do, what do you think I'm going to do?  Just sit there and be sexually assaulted?  I'll get out if they come near me.  What if a child walks in?  Well, that's his fucking bad luck. 
[02:46:00]  He'll listen next time when Mother is warning him.  I'm not a pedophile at all, but sometimes it's about teaching the lesson.  So that was my...  And, of course, my massage yesterday.  How'd that go?  Good.  I thought I was doing great.  It was like a mutual touch massage, so I'm giving her a really soft rub.  Mutual touch.  Can I set this up, by the way?  You sure can.  A little bit.  You played to a sold-out crowd in Boston at the Orpheum Theater. 
[02:46:30]  Not close to sold-out.  Over 200 people, yes.  You killed.  And then you were in Atlantic City, killing.  Yep, 2,500 people.  And then you came home to New York, what, yesterday or late Saturday?  And then you got a massage to treat yourself, I guess?  Well, because I'm basically a zero.  Yeah.  And I know that.  But they see you up on the stage.  They think you're a rock star.  It means nothing.  They don't.  Little do they know, you're just...  I'm garblish.  They do know I'm garblish.  They do know, actually.  That's why half the guys relate to me, because they know that my life is shit.  And in that regard, I cannot find a happy relationship. 
[02:47:00]  So I'm getting a massage, and I'm giving her a massage.  And it's just supposed to be a strict massage.  So I kiss her thighs a little bit.  And she lets me.  She's like, oh.  How are you down by her...  What position do you do?  She was laying on my bed on her back.  She's laying...  She's laying on your bed...  Wait, she's laying...  No, no, it wasn't mutual massage at the same time.  She's laying in your bed on her back, and she's there to massage you.  Oh, it's not the same time?  Yeah, no, I didn't mind.  It was like a light touch.  I thought it was like a 69 thing.  No, no, no, no.  She's laying on her stomach, and then I'm touching the back of her thighs.  Do you get a massage first or last? 
[02:47:30]  I've never done that before where I massage at all.  But this one I did first.  And I just wanted to see how someone would respond to it.  And she's getting the goosebumps.  It was like a little light touch tantric thing.  So she rolls over on her back, and I kind of like...  Well, that's sort of like the hello.  It was sexy, yeah.  Your signal is like...  Is she covered with anything?  No, she's nude.  She's nude, and she rolls over on her back?  Yeah.  All right, that's hello now.  I'm brushing my hands gently over her skin, and I go up by her nipples, and I touch the nipple. 
[02:48:00]  I'm not sure if she's going to let me.  Yeah.  And she does, and her nipple gets hard.  And then I kind of...  I kiss her knees a little bit, and like where her...  In the inner part of her arm, like where her arm bends, and she doesn't stop me.  And then I kiss like where the leg...  Dopey Breathe Right Strip on?  No, I didn't.  It was Breathe Right Stripless.  I kiss where the leg meets the body, and her legs part a little bit.  Oh, Jesus.  And I feel...  Yeah, I touch the front of her lips, and I feel that she's wet, and she's turned on.  So, you know, I'm just... 
[02:48:30]  Lick your nipple a little bit, and she lets me...  You smashed her head with a brick.  Cut her head right off.  Fucked her.  Well, her head was in a bowling bag.  It came all over the floor, and then me and Otis Toole went out and had a pabst.  No, I wound up brushing her stomach, and I wound up like kissing by her pussy, and I  wound up sneaking my tongue over there.  Uh-huh.  And the next thing you know, I'm licking it.  Yeah.  But I didn't know she was going to allow that.  Licking it well.  At this point? 
[02:49:00]  Yeah, but you never know.  I think you have carte blanche to anything.  My dick was as hard and as fucking lovely as it's ever been, and I'm standing at the  edge of the bed.  It was right by her hand, and she grabs it, and she's jerking me off, and it was fucking  amazing.  I'm eating her.  She's going crazy, and I'm playing with her nipples, and I'm fucking...  So I finally come around and kneel on the bed, and I'm kneeling up by her face with my  rod, and she's jerking me off, and I'm trying to ease it towards her mouth.  You want some action.  Yeah.  And she won't suck it, so I'm like, all right, let me just try to fuck her. 
[02:49:30]  So I start, like, kissing.  I think I'm doing such a good job, too, because I'm, like, licking her pussy.  You know it's Jimmy, so this just has to end badly.  She's getting into it, and the way, like, I'm licking it, I'm lifting her leg a little  bit, and the next thing you know, she's on her back, and I'm kind of, like, kneeling  on the bed, licking her pussy with her one leg draped over my back now.  I'm slowly...  It's like fucking a Brazilian jiu-jitsu move.  I'm trying to work my way in for a leg lock.  So I'm kind of, like, you know, I'm kissing her pussy again. 
[02:50:00]  I push her leg over, open a little bit more, and I scoop my little fat torso in.  Now she knows what's coming.  Yeah, and then the next thing you know, I'm kneeling between her legs, and she's jerking  me while I lean over and lick her nipples, and I'm trying to just push it up against the  lips.  Yeah.  Now, there's a problem, because I don't have a condom, and I'm not going to stick it in  without a condom.  Problem for her.  Oh, for her, yeah, for me.  No problem at all.  You don't care.  No, you know, you don't want to do that, but I didn't even know if I could...  I wanted to see what her vibe was on the whole thing to begin with, and she wouldn't 
[02:50:30]  let me touch it, but she's really turned on, and I'm like, she wants to fuck, and she  goes, you want to do that, don't you?  I'm like, yeah.  She goes, that's a lot more money.  I'm like, oh, fucker.  Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.  Now go home and get your fucking shine box.  She was really good. 
[02:51:00]  I thought I was doing so well.  You just thought you were doing good.  Oh, her pussy was wet, probably thinking of all the money she was about to get from stupid.  He's just getting a little fucking manners.  And I'm like, of course, I said the thing any man with dignity would say, how much more?  How much?  And she goes, how much do you think it's worth?  And I'm like, I don't know.  And she's like, well, I've never done this before.  And I'm thinking, oh, you lying twat.  That means $1.20.  Very expensive.  So she goes, because the massage was going to be $200, which is pretty average, I think, for a tantric massage. 
[02:51:30]  You get nothing.  You lose.  Good day, sir.  She goes, I'm like, how much?  And she goes, $1,000.  $1,000?  It's impossible.  I'm trying to tell you that.  What do you want?  You want the tears to come out of my eyes?  I'm like, pesos?  Rupels?  Thank you, Ken. 
[02:52:00]  $1,000 she wanted.  So I laid on my back.  And I wish I had a photo of my hog.  It was in fantastic shape.  And she threw lotion on it.  And I just caused a real ruckus on myself.  You just made the mess.  Yeah.  You thought it was going to end in romance.  I thought she was into it, because her pretty face, she was moaning.  And I'm very rarely taken off guard like that.  She was good.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  Yeah, that's, wow.  What a tragic story that I saw coming a mile away. 
[02:52:30]  Of course you did.  Because I'm what you call a zilch.  Do you think if you were like a model guy that she would have just done it, acting the  same way?  Because now, of course, no one's as good as Jimmy like that.  I don't know.  But do you think if, you know...  I don't know.  I don't know.  Because I was giving her a good enough head.  Because didn't it seem like she was getting turned on?  Yeah.  Physically?  My rod looked good enough where if she was really horny, she would have. 
[02:53:00]  I don't know about that.  Probably.  Yeah.  Bastard.  She'd have cut her head off.  You're right.  I know.  She'd have fucking pulled an Edmund Kemper.  She'd have fucking slaughtered my mother's best friend.  And then talked to my mom while her fucking lays head was in a bowling bag.  How do you not love Edmund Kemper, 6'6", highway killer?  Or the California co-ed killer he was.  Look him up.  Someone was calling it the old master bait and switch.  Dude, I thought I was doing so well.  I am just a fucking zero. 
[02:53:30]  It's amazing to me.  And you still get bamboozled into thinking.  I still get hoodwinked.  And there are women that like me and there are women that I like, but there's always a  problem.  There's always something else.  Yeah.  You know, there's always something negative attached to it where it's just not going to  develop into anything.  That is a tragic story.  Hmm.  Well.  But I'll have this fucking smoothie.  All right.  It must have just been Firehose City, though.  And, uh...  It was an embarrassing amount of cum. 
[02:54:00]  Jesus.  It was.  It was the type of cum where you're going, I've never cum this much.  I apologize that your hand is so tired because I'm continually cumming.  It sounded like somebody was doing jumping jacks in the mud with rubber shoes.  I said, go ahead, honey.  Take a break.  And then my cock hovered.  She came back 20 minutes later and finished it. 
[02:54:30]  A wading pool of cum all over my fat, colorless stomach.  You can't tell where the cum ends and my skin begins.  I'm the color of a load.  I really need a fucking tanning lamp.  I'm the color of a viscous-y load.  All right.  Listen.  We're going to enjoy our smoothies.  We're going to take a break.  Oh, God.  When do we get back?  Yes.  Uh, Dateline.  The whole, uh, Predator thing.  Mm.  We missed four, five, and six. 
[02:55:00]  Great.  I forgot.  Want to hear it.  I can't mention her name.  I got an email from somebody from Perverted Justice who's involved with them on a level  who does stings, and she's a fan of the show.  I thought you got an email just out of your chatting.  No.  By the way.  By the way.  I'm not one.  No, she's a friend.  Um, I don't know her well, but, I mean, I've talked to her many times on email.  We met once.  She was in Boston. 
[02:55:30]  I know this girl, and she's one of the girls who does the stings, and I know I-  Have you chat with her and try to fuck her?  Are you going to get arrested?  No, no, no, because I talk to her as her adult self.  Oh, okay.  Um, but I think we're going to- I'm going to try to find out if she can come on or send  me some transcripts or even audio.  That'd be nice.  That'd be cool.  Yeah, yeah, she does the real thing.  She's one of the people.  Steve on Long Island.  Steve.  Hey, good morning, Jimmy.  Good morning, guys.  Uh, Jim, I've been thinking about disease, age, or stuff like that.  I mean, the last thing you knew we need to take the funny other show is, uh, you, you 
[02:56:00]  know, in a bathrobe, uh, 90 pounds.  No, I wasn't going to put it in without a rubber.  I mean, I'm a perv, but I'm not an idiot.  I'm not-  Yeah, but you're going down on her.  I mean, you don't think your tongue's going to fall off?  No, dude, I believe me.  If I did- I was on top of the clit.  I'm not a dope.  I didn't lick all the way down between the lips.  I was on top of the clit.  Yeah, because there's no AIDS up there.  No, there's really not.  There's nothing on the clit.  But the clit's fine.  No.  No AIDS over there?  Absolutely not.  The AIDS can't climb that high.  It doesn't.  I'm all about AIDS from eating a girl's clit.  But I wouldn't- a girl like that, I would never put my mouth, like, on the lips or between- 
[02:56:30]  I just wouldn't.  I mean, I- it would bother me more than it would turn me on.  It's like trying to climb Mount Everest.  They just give up at one of the base camps down below.  I know, there's a little Sherpa on the lip, hauling HIV.  Thank you, Ope.  That deserves something from him.  But he sipped the smoothie and ignored me.  People are asking, how are we sipping smoothies, as Jimmy's just talking about his loads.  How are you sipping them?  You want to see them, they're dumping them on their backs and licking them off each other.  It's really a homoerotic thing.  Viscousy smoothie. 
[02:57:00]  You ever come so hard, it's fucking white and clear with a little yellow tinge in there?  It was an embarrassing amount of semen.  I'm sorry, lady, that I came so much on my fat fish belly.  Because the more I came, the more she had to look at my stomach.  Fucking jerked me off.  Blurka, blurka, blurka, blurka, blurka.  Blurka, blurka, blurka, blurka.  Sorry.  Goes to the left on the comforter.  Blurka, blurka, blurka. 
[02:57:30]  Holy shit.  That was a load.  Oh, Rachel.  I fucking came.  To quote John Fox, I came like a busted sprinkler head.  I fucking shot a load.  It looked like a fucking paintball fight on my stomach with one gun with clear,  viscous-y, thick paint in it. 
[02:58:00]  Oh, did I come good.  Blurka, blurka.  That's exactly what it sounded like.  And I swear to God, as she's jerking me, fucking, she's not getting her thousand, so she's peeking  back at the clock.  Clock watcher.  That's what it sounds like.  Blurka, blurka, blurka, blurka.  Blurka, blurka, blurka.  Holy shit.  Her fucking shattered dreams and my destroyed ego, all in one glop on my fat belly. 
[02:58:30]  Here we go.  Listen.  Out of shape pig I am.  Been working out for months.  And the nicest compliment I've gotten about my body is that that benefit we did at Gotham  the other night, fucking awful Patrice O'Neal is sitting there and he goes to grab my tit.  And he goes, wow, man, it's hard to grab your titty.  It's not there.  You did lose weight.  Thanks a lot, fuckers that I know.  That's the nicest compliment I get is from that fucking sexually addicted nothing trying  to pinch my fat tit and embarrass me.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  We got to take a break.  We certainly do. 
[02:59:00]  Before I blurka, blurka, blurka all over your faces.  Jimmy, I don't know what happened to you.  You're on fire today.  Thanks.  That was kind of a backhanded compliment.  I'm like, Jim, I don't know what happened to you.  You're finally earning some money that we pay you.  I don't know what happened to him.  You know, you're God funny.  Do they decide to start paying you over the weekend or something?  I wouldn't know.  No.  All right, listen.  Dateline to catch a predator.  We didn't do weeks four, five, and six.  So this is what we do today.  The best of weeks four through six. 
[02:59:30]  Let's hear it.  So we got like, you know, about a dozen clips to go through.  The best of.  So we're getting right to the good ones, okay?  We'll do that after the break.  But first.

[03:03:00]  Wolf Mother  I was just telling Jimmy  that's probably why they threw it on  all weekend long I was listening to the  Wolf Mother CD  what song is this?  it's the hit  what?  I forget  oh it's just called Woman  okay  there's a song called White Unicorn  track 2 that I really really like  a lot  white unicorn man  well I brought a lot of CDs  home with me  because I went all the way out to  South Hold  from Manhattan and back  it was a weekend of driving  so I checked out the latest Pearl Jam 
[03:03:30]  I checked out Snow Patrol  I checked out Tool's new CD  Wolf Mother  there was another one in there  oh and Godsmack  Godsmack's new CD is really really good  yeah I got that  Tool was very repetitive  I don't know  I'm a big Tool fan  but nothing really grabbed me on that CD yet  Pearl Jam was interesting  I haven't listened to a new  Pearl Jam CD in a very long time  it wasn't that bad at all  but Wolf Mother  forget it  I couldn't get enough of it  I probably played the album  five or six times  all the way through this weekend  White Unicorn 
[03:04:00]  you're gonna wear out your stylus  play it that much  we got White Unicorn in the system  do we have a Wolf Mother CD  laying around this joint  I don't know if we do  I think I took the only copy  they were supposed to be on our show  Godsmack was supposed to be on our show  they still might be  alright  well let's get these bands going  you know what I do  Red Hot Chili Peppers by the way  selling like crazy  it sold like a half million copies  in the first week  I can't be bothered with  the Red Hot Chili Peppers anymore  give it away 
[03:04:30]  give it away  give it away now  I was a big fan of the old stuff  and Blood Sugar Sex Magic  I love that album  that was like the last  you know  which album I really liked  but then after that  they got too polished  believe it or not  yeah  yeah they're trying to like  sing songs and  no Wolf Mother Ben  I wanted to play White Unicorn  it was a song I was  talking about  going to the carnival  I like that song though  I downloaded a bunch of them  after  who was it  the recommended Wolf Mother  Simon Rex  Simon Rex 
[03:05:00]  turned us all on to Wolf Mother  and I'm so glad he did  fucking iTunes  they have like six songs  for an album  it's like  just put the whole record  on there already  I don't get that  with iTunes  I probably want to sell  but some bands  that aren't on there  at all  the new Chili Peppers album  is really good though  I know  I just can't be bothered  and I shouldn't say that  because I usually  at least give it a listen  I was just like  it's really funky  oh and I checked out  the new Stain CD  that was the other CD  the Pearl Jam record  is really good  I wasn't hating it  that's for sure 
[03:05:30]  Tool is very repetitive  Tool every song  is ten minutes long  it's that same bass  you know  beat going on  through the whole song  nothing like  popped out at me  on that  Wolf Mother though  sounds like  Zeppelin  Sabbath  Old Sticks  and a lot of those  old 70s bands  that just kind of  you know  talked about  sang about  like  that mythology  the  castles  yeah castles  on a cloud  carnivals  and all that  carnivals  it's very Dio 
[03:06:00]  it's very Dio  yeah no I know  but some of the  70s  basic rock bands  that went down  that road a little bit  too  and then they also  sound like  the White Stripes  yeah  rock music  rock sales  is way up  you see that article  in the paper yesterday  about the Chili Peppers  and Pearl Jam  both had huge weeks  Godsmack had a huge week  number one in the country  I didn't even know that  Godsmack sold  214,000 copies  out of the box  that's huge  I like that  they're still doing it  Raconteurs hit  there too  it was pretty good  actually the Raconteurs  comes out tomorrow  the Raconteurs review  in the Sunday paper 
[03:06:30]  was four stars  yeah  and they were talking  about how  they went retro  with this album  70s big guitar rock  is coming back  four stars  and Rolling Stones  too  four stars  and Rolling Stones  for the Raconteurs  the Raconteurs  right Jimmy  blech  yeah magazine  irrelevant  actually they got  a great new issue  out about  who's 1,000th issue  who's the cover  bottom of the paths  or the socks  what's great about it  it's every cover  in their history  and stuff about it  it's pretty good  1,000 covers they show  yeah  they show

[03:51:30]  yeah  imagine  we would have that trademarked as our own  back when we invented it  we've been the pioneers as far as a bunch of things go in this business  they use it all over the country  instant feedback  swear to god we were the first ones  we invented that  we actually had to get scott colombo to write a program  the first program  even before that  we were saying instant feedback  uh back at uh  yeah  back in the old day  actually we were just using our own um um uh screen names on aol or something  if i remember correctly 
[03:52:00]  yeah and it was like you pop it up and say if you have any instant feedback for the show  that's right  because you didn't have to wait for us to answer the phone or maybe not  it would just pop right up  and we'd instantly  you'd instantly be able to give feedback uh to the show  and now all over  missed opportunity  missed opportunity  did you see in the paper over the weekend  howard stern is renting a house for six hundred thousand dollars in the hamptons  give me a bag of shells  i heard he was on the phone trying to get a motorboat with three propellers  you know i did the math  and get the clicking out of the phone  i did the math today 
[03:52:30]  do you know that howard  makes  conservatively  yeah  two million dollars a week  a week  a week  a hundred million a year  that's a pretty nice chunk of change  a couple of million bucks a week  two million dollars a week  because they're making a big deal that he rented a house for six hundred thousand in the hamptons  think of your weekly paycheck people  and look at it  think of what it is  right  imagine it's two million 
[03:53:00]  and it's not just a one-time deal  it's a week  and people like i can't believe six hundred thousand for a house in the hamptons  i was like  you dummies  that's like  if you worked seven days a week  that would be two days work  yeah  he's paying for his hamptons rental  working two days  two days  like by tomorrow he'll have it paid for  so whatever your two days pay is  that's like what it is to him  yeah  to have the whole summer  yeah  to have a hamptons  a place in the hamptons  yeah beachfront property  a hundred thousand dollars for two months 
[03:53:30]  for the summer  for the summer so what eight weeks  nine weeks  whatever it would be  yeah  yeah  yeah  well when you're making two million  a week  a week  jesus  and the tax has got to be a bitch  huh  and it's probably more than that  maybe ten twenty thousand dollars  perhaps more than that anthony  plus he takes off uh every friday  like you're over the top one  every friday  good  all right back to the uh  to catch a predator best of weeks  four through six  right  i was standing in the bathroom 
[03:54:00]  and poe's voice wrecked my bitch  i was bent over  and i knew it  i knew it was coming  jimmy was bent over  with his ass cheeks spread out  ridiculously far  and i've walked into the bathroom  and just faced that  a couple of times  my worst fears  and uh  he was gonna do it today  but he heard  he heard poe's voice  and he wasn't sure  if it was us coming in  we were someone from the economist  so he was all scared  so right when i came in  all i saw was him  walking into a stall 
[03:54:30]  with his pants around his ankles  and his white ass  just making it into the stall  just as i walked in  and then opie goes back around  and goes  don't wash your hands today  do me a favor  just don't wash your hands today  do yourself a favor  and i walk around the corner  to the sinks  and jimmy is there  with his ass cheeks  spread apart  i figure you shouldn't be  deprived of that  just because of poe's blunder  indie mic  good afternoon gentlemen  hello indie mic  what do you got today sir
