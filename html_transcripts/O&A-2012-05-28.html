<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast, a Memorial Day special, began with a lengthy interview of Chris Kyle, author of "American Sniper,"  featuring comedian Bob Kelly.  The discussion covered Kyle's experiences as a Navy SEAL sniper in Iraq, including graphic details of his first kill (a woman with a grenade), his confirmed kill count (over 150, possibly over 255), and the psychological toll of his service.  The conversation compared his experiences to video games like Call of Duty, touched on the ethical dilemmas of killing, and included humorous anecdotes about life on base and the challenges of field sanitation.  Kyle recounted his bar fight with Jesse Ventura, stemming from Ventura's alleged disparaging remarks about fallen SEALs.  A phone call with Alex Jones ensued, during which Jones questioned Kyle’s account and suggested a conspiracy, also mentioning a false story about Ventura’s reckless driving in California.  The segment further explored Kyle's business ventures and his award from the Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs, leading to a discussion about the Posse Comitatus Act, which Kyle admitted he didn't understand.  Potential reconciliation between Kyle and Ventura, possibly mediated by Jones, was discussed.

Following this, the show featured R. Lee Ermey as a guest.  Ermey discussed his military career, his acting experiences (particularly in *Full Metal Jacket* and *Texas Chainsaw Massacre*),  recounting scenes and uncensored dialogue, and his personal life.  The conversation was punctuated by crude humor and profanity, and included anecdotes about flying a P-51 Mustang and his large diamond ring.

Next, Opie and Anthony played audio clips from "Radio First Termer," an underground radio show broadcast illegally from Vietnam (1970-71) by a serviceman known as Dave Rabbit.  The show, originating from a whorehouse, featured irreverent commentary, "Messages from the Latrine Walls," music, weather reports from a character called Captain Ivan Pansy, and significant amounts of profanity and sexual references.  A caller identified a reference to heroin.  The hosts speculated on how Rabbit evaded detection. Later, they connected with Rabbit via phone.  Rabbit revealed his real name (not disclosed in the summary), explained his motivation for the show (his roommate's death), detailed the show's location and eventual shutdown, and discussed his current podcasting activities.

The show continued with a Memorial Day themed segment, "Red White and Boo," hosted by Robert Kelly.  A phone interview with Donald Rumsfeld promoted his book, "Known and Unknown," and his donation of proceeds to the troops.  Louis C.K., in studio, repeatedly asked Rumsfeld if he was a lizard person. The conversation with Rumsfeld covered his experiences and political views.

Subsequently, Jesse Ventura appeared in studio and engaged in a heated argument with Jim Norton, ultimately resulting in Ventura walking out. The argument concerned the application of legal processes to terrorists and profiling, with Ventura opposing certain government actions in the name of national security. The segment ended with considerable cursing and shouting.

The show then featured Clint Hill, a former Secret Service agent for the Kennedy administration, who discussed his new book and his experiences protecting Jackie Kennedy, including his account of the assassination.  He described the events of that day, the President's injuries, Mrs. Kennedy's reaction, the chaotic aftermath, and his feelings of failure.  He also discussed conspiracy theories and his later interactions with Jackie Kennedy Onassis.

The final segment featured another interview with Robert Kelly,  with Jeff Ross also in studio.  Kelly reiterated his claim of seeing a werewolf in Iraq, despite skepticism. The conversation included other humorous and absurd anecdotes from his time in Iraq, including a fight with Colin Quinn, and a previous on-air claim about Bigfoot on Mars.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  From the brass, Donald Rumsfeld, are you a lizard?  Can you imagine if I answered that?  To the boots on the ground.  Where'd you hit her head?  No, I always aim center mass.  It leaves more room to be able to hit the target.  Opie and Anthony salute the brave men and women protecting this great nation.  Red, white, and boom!  And now, to take you through some of our favorite military-themed moments,  here's your host, comedian, and guy who went to Iraq once, Bob Kelly.  Hey, it's Robert Kelly, host of the You Know What, Dude! podcast. 
[00:00:30]  Heard weekends here on the Opie and Anthony channel, as well as riotcast.com.  Anywho, welcome to the Opie and Anthony red, white, and boo!  Our horrible attempt at saluting those who have served their country proudly.  On today's show, we'll feature the Vietnam tapes of U.S. Air Force DJ Dave Rabbit,  Governor and former Navy SEAL Jesse the Body Ventura, 
[00:01:00]  former Secretary of State Donald Rumsfeld,  U.S. Marine Corps Gunnery Sergeant and Full Metal Jacket star R. Lee Emery.  Right?  Ermie.  Ermie.  Ugh.  U.S.  Who the fuck has a name like that?  Just fucking...  Can't we just say R. Lee?  R. Lee, the dude from Full Metal Jacket.  Nobody needs to know his name.  Former Kennedy and Administra...  What is this?  Former Kennedy Administration Secretary, Secret Service Agent, Clint Hill. 
[00:01:30]  You got Clint Hill in?  No shit.  Fuck.  Could you make this fucking more difficult to say?  Former Kennedy Administration Secret Service Agent, Clint Hill.  For you dummies, the guy grabbing the brains.  But first, we'll start off with U.S. Navy SEAL Chris Kyle.  He's known as the deadliest sniper in U.S. military history. 
[00:02:00]  In the fucking U.S. military history.  That's the history of the U.S. military.  That's around 57 years.  Look it up.  He's promoting his book and bonding with Anthony over artillery?  It's not artillery.  It's guns.  Artillery is like a cannon.  It's not fucking artillery.  Dude, I got a...  What the fuck is artillery? 
[00:02:30]  Who uses that fucking word?  He's bonding with Anthony over guns.  I was there too.  And I asked him brilliant questions.  Like, are you good at Call of Duty?  Apparently he's not a fan.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  We got Chris Kyle.  How you doing?  How you doing?  Promoting American Sniper in bookstores and Amazon right now.  Pleasure.  So, welcome to the show.  Thank you for having me.  Just what a great story, man.  Sniper, most lethal in U.S. military history. 
[00:03:00]  That's a hell of a title to have.  I've got to thank the publicist for that.  Yeah, huh?  That's definitely...  I was trying to get a different story out there, but that's the title.  Oh, are you?  I'm trying to show all the sacrifices that military members go through and then the families after we leave, what they have to go through and the sacrifices they make.  This is a better selling title, though.  Nobody's going to buy...  It's easier to sell this and then you get to it in the book.  Because, like, you know, a sniper with a heart probably wouldn't do as well as this devil's sniper. 
[00:03:30]  Yeah, people just want to hear about...  Well, the fact of the matter is, snipers...  There's a great mystique around the sniper.  Especially lately, we've heard a few of the stories that have come out with the Somali pirates and stuff.  Just the image of those snipers taking that shot, those shots at the pirates in the ship.  And really gets people's fascination up about snipers.  Definitely.  And now, how did you get into it? 
[00:04:00]  Well, when I went into the military, as a new guy, my chief finally said,  Okay, if you want to go to sniper school, I will nominate you.  At the time, you had to be nominated and the chief was willing to say,  You're a good enough shot, I will send you to sniper school.  And you were a good enough shot because you had shot previously your whole life, pretty much, right?  I had grown up with weapons, hunting my whole life.  How long had you been a SEAL by that point?  It was a new guy.  So, I don't think I... 
[00:04:30]  I didn't go to be a sniper until I came back from my first deployment, which came back in 2003.  So, in fact, when you come back from deployment, you get about a month off  to where you can try to readjust back into civilian life and learn your way around.  And I end up taking...  Instead of that month, I took about two weeks off so I could go straight into sniper school.  And what was it about sniper school and becoming a sniper that kind of fascinated you?  Well, I thought they had all the cool toys.  They had the scoped rifles and they got the really expensive guns. 
[00:05:00]  They're taking precision shots.  I thought, wow, those guys are really good.  You know, whatever they want to shoot, they're hitting.  Yeah.  What is the...  The first time you shoot somebody, and this is such a civilian question, but I'm a civilian,  is it hard for you the first time you do it, or...  It definitely was.  Especially my first shot was on a woman.  And...  Yeah, fucking bitch.  Wow.  What was her problem?  What the fuck?  No, she...  The supper cold? 
[00:05:30]  Yeah, what game did she talk to her?  She was out in the town greeting the Marines during the invasion.  As the Marines were coming into the city there, the people were coming out to, you know, show  their support for the Marines so the Marines wouldn't shoot them down, let them know that,  hey, we're not fighting you.  You just go ahead and come right on in.  Well, she came out into the crowd.  She had a grenade on her.  She pulled the pin and was walking to the Marines.  Whoa.  Now, how did you know to keep focus on her, or were you watching from a distance, or were 
[00:06:00]  you close?  I was close.  I was in the city already.  I was up in the top of a building watching, trying to keep track of the crowd, and my  job was anything that we could try to soften the target for the Marines, so less of them  would have injuries, and that was our job.  So now, what was...  What did you have to do before you took that shot?  I turned to my chief, and I said, this is what she's got, this is what she's doing,  and he kept saying, you got to take her out.  You got to take her out.  What if she was just eating an apple?  Yeah, that's what we do. 
[00:06:30]  How did you know, like...  Give her a bigger hole in her head to put the apple in.  What made you look at her out of the whole crowd and go, there's something weird about  that?  Well, first of all, the grenade was the Chinese grenade.  It's yellow in color, and just, you know, when you're out there trying to watch, all  of a sudden you see a color flash, it definitely draws your attention to it.  But why did they use yellow?  Yeah.  That's silly.  That's a little too obvious.  At least on ground, light fuse get away.  Yeah, yeah.  It's kind of racist, too.  Oh, please.  That is something. 
[00:07:00]  So I guess you have to be up on other weapons and what the threat could be that's coming  up to some of the guys.  I mean, you can tell, too.  It's not just the color, but once you actually...  The color is what drew my eye to it, but then once I started actually getting it in the scope,  zooming in on it, and trying to really identify what she had, it was easy to tell.  It has a fuse on it, and you can see the way she was holding it, what was in her hand.  And so I'm describing everything to my chief of what I see, and he says, that's a Chinese  grenade.  So now the chief gives the order, or gives you the permission to take the shot. 
[00:07:30]  And this is your first kill at all, or your first kill as a sniper?  No, I wasn't even a sniper.  This was my first deployment.  I was just on a sniper rifle.  Oh, okay.  And he told me I had to take the shot.  Where'd you hit her head?  No, I always aimed center mass.  It was in less...  You know, if you go for the head, it just leaves more area of error.  So try to shoot center mass, it leaves more room to be able to hit the target. 
[00:08:00]  Double tap?  Well, it was just single shot.  I mean, big enough caliber, it takes one round.  What were you using?  It was a .300 Win Mag.  Oh, my God.  And you were proven right.  She had a grenade, right?  Yes.  Oh, yes.  As soon as I shot her, you know, she went down, the grenade fell, went off.  Her iPod fell out of her hand.  She had a grenade case on it.  It was a grenade case.  Just trying to be hip.  She was a hipster.  She was just going on to Amazon.  It's a cool grenade case. 
[00:08:30]  Yes.  It's terrible.  Have you ever played...  I mean, this is a stupid question, but have you ever played Call of Duty and those video  games and been a sniper and just sucked?  Oh, yes.  What pisses us off, we go overseas on the deployments or whatever, and we could link up to play online.  Right.  And then you got the headset on and everything, and you're playing a 12-year-old kid at Stakeside.  See, this is the same thing.  And he is talking mad crap, and I'm sitting there going, you have no idea.  I knew it. 
[00:09:00]  That's hilarious.  I knew it.  All those little bastards all the time.  We knew it.  You suck.  You couldn't fucking shoot me.  I nailed you.  I nailed you.  Really?  Did you?  Did you?  I just killed 150 guys for real, you shit dick.  But if you say, I'm a real sniper, they'd be like, no, you're not.  Fuck you, faggot.  They would never believe you anyway.  Oh, no.  No, not at all.  Oh, that's hilarious.  I mean, they'd be like, I wish you a real sniper in this game, because you suck.  What's the longest you ever went in battle without sleeping?  I mean, it's just you, and you have another guy with you when you're sniping to give you 
[00:09:30]  the range and all that stuff, right?  Or is it just you?  No, I didn't go out and just me.  And usually when I went out, especially in the city, you go out pretty heavily.  So there's about 16 of us.  So it's not like Billy Zane, where you're just you and some dude, and just you're sitting  out for three days, and you kill the one El Capitan, and then run for your life to get  the helicopter.  So you're just with the troop, and it's just in the city.  You're not sniping from 2,000 yards out, right? 
[00:10:00]  No, I did that one time, but 2,100 was my farthest shot.  But other than that, most of your shots are anywhere from 200 to 400 yards.  Really?  Hmm.  Wow.  Wow.  And what did you train on, mostly?  What kind of rifles?  Well, it all depends on the mission.  Before I'd go in, I'd look at overhead imagery, try to figure out what's the possible longest  shot I could take.  Like the video game with the loadout.  Yeah, right.  Let me trade this down. 
[00:10:30]  I'm going to grab this.  I've got the longest shot.  Call of Duty, what sniper should I use?  What rifle should I use?  Ask the 12-year-old.  Exactly.  Hey, I want to ask Chris about the numbers, because the government won't confirm that  you killed 255 people.  In the book, it says over 150.  Over 150?  Yes.  But you know it's more.  You know your number?  I'm happy with 150.  Oh, okay.  So you don't need to have the number.  Is it harder for you as a person if the number's higher? 
[00:11:00]  Like, it sounds cool to us, because we're fucking nerds, but is it like, the guy who actually  did it, do you go, you know, 150's fine, I don't need 250?  No, I mean, I don't even care about the number.  But as far as the record goes, I don't care, because it's going to be beat, and I hope it  gets beat soon, that way someone else will be in the limelight.  But a lot of people say you killed up to 255 people.  I've seen that all over.  And he's smiling, so.  What is a confirmed kill?  Does someone else have to see you do it, or how do they confirm a kill?  Well, every time I went out, because I wasn't alone, there were always guys there to 
[00:11:30]  see it and to actually witness it.  Every time I would take a shot, I have to take down, make notes of the time I took the  shot, the distance the guy was, what he was doing, what he was wearing, what he was carrying.  Wow.  What I shot him with, the grain of the bullet, you know, what the temperature was.  It's like an expense report.  Yeah, yeah.  Wow, the business.  And you have to do that, like, right then, or do you have, like, can you wait until you're  safe?  We usually have to break out a, hang on one second, hold that fire.  Well, usually when I was taking my shots, there was an officer who was on the radio. 
[00:12:00]  So, that was his job during that time, was to be the radio watch, to keep the base notified  of what we were doing.  He would take down the notes when we'd get back, is when we'd actually fill out the formal  report.  Like cops.  Right.  What the fuck?  Those cocksuckers used to run out in the street with a grenade, and we got to fill out reports?  Yeah.  With the grain of the fuck.  This wee shit.  There's no way anyone...  I do it on Call of Duty.  I protect the country.  Okay.  There's no way anyone would write you up for a speeding ticket at this point, right? 
[00:12:30]  Oh, you'd be surprised.  Not on base, you actually will get a speeding ticket.  You can't pull out a card, like, look who I am?  No.  Yeah, right, look who I am.  Yeah, you don't have, like, a gold bullet that you can pull out.  Well, you'd be surprised.  I mean, a lot of people view, especially other people in the military, seals with, we have  this huge ego and this bad attitude, and it's come from, in the past, guys have thought,  you know what, I'm better than you are.  So, it's taken us a long time.  You are better than me.  Yeah.  In every way.  Yeah.  Your facial hair connects. 
[00:13:00]  Everything about you, your accent, everything.  It took us a long time showing these guys, look, we're not better than you are, we're just  trained differently, and we were more specialized in an area than you were.  It doesn't make me any better, and we were working with the Army Conventional, showing  them, hey, I'm here to help you.  We're all on the same team.  You have to obey traffic laws.  It sucks.  Did you ever have a problem with the ethical side of it, where, you know, it's, when you 
[00:13:30]  boil it down, it's just, it's killing people.  And I wonder how difficult that is for you, or was at some point, when you really think  that, you know, semantics is one thing.  That's, you know, okay, if I wasn't given permission to do what I did, I'd be what would  be considered a mass murderer, really.  And since I have been given permission from the government, I'm not, yet it's the same 
[00:14:00]  end result.  How do you deal with that internally?  Well, I never looked at it as, I'm there killing people.  I looked at it as, I'm there saving people.  My job was to make sure everybody I deployed with came home, and all the allies, everyone  surrounded me, my job is to protect them.  I want everybody, as much as possible, to be able to come home.  And believe me, that's how I feel.  I just brought that question up because these assholes want to know.  I was thinking, that Chris must think you're such a radical lefty pan.  I know. 
[00:14:30]  You have no idea.  Like, what?  Believe me.  You have no idea who just asked that question, Chris.  He has a 50 cal.  I actually, no, he brushes his teeth with it.  I brought this for you to sign for me.  It's the, uh, 50 cal magazine.  Yeah, 50 cal mag out of the, uh, M107.  It might have a few guns.  I got it home.  I got one of those.  It's a picture to shoot, isn't it?  It doesn't give out numbers, but he owns a bunch of guns.  Yeah.  Somewhere between four and two thousand.  I love them.  You guys should definitely hang out.  I actually wanted to ask you something about the, uh, the Barrett. 
[00:15:00]  Um, I know when I've fired this, uh, the concussion off of it, it, it, it, I, I describe  it as feeling like you have the flu for three seconds.  It's a concussion or feeling like you were just popped in the nose for, for like a second.  But how do you, how do you shoot this for, for as long as you do and, and not just lose  your mind?  Cause it's, uh, I mean, in training, obviously when you're out in the field, you're probably  not shooting it that much.  Right.  Out in the field, I never took the 50 cal out. 
[00:15:30]  Oh, you didn't?  No, it's, it's big.  It's heavy.  The rounds weigh a lot.  When, if I took a 338 Lapua, it weighs less, the rounds weigh less and I can actually shoot  farther and more accurate.  Oh, okay.  How big are those bullets?  I don't know anything about guns compared to a 50 cal.  Uh, they're definitely smaller.  Everything's smaller than a 50 cal.  Yeah, yeah.  The, for the 50 is crazy.  So what would, what would the 50 be optimum for?  Uh, vehicle.  Vehicle.  Okay.  Yeah.  Shooting through engines.  Wow.  Actually, we, uh, we started making, cause they were saying the 50 cal sniper rifle should be 
[00:16:00]  used for vehicles, but anytime you shoot a vehicle, you're going to shoot it through  the engine block.  It's not going to automatically seize up and stop.  Right, right.  The best way to stop a vehicle is to shoot the driver.  The driver.  Yeah.  Yeah, I guess so.  And then it just veers off to the left, to the right.  Hey, what about, uh, as a, what, do you have, um, numerical rankings in what you, what  you, uh, cause I know very little, what was, uh, I'm thinking about Lee Harvey Oswald  and how, uh, people said he couldn't have made that shot, but he was actually, uh, a 
[00:16:30]  sharpshooter, he was actually a great shot.  I don't think he was probably what you can do.  Um, how hard is that shot to make from what you know about it?  Uh, the, the shot that Oswald.  The Oswald's not shot?  Yeah, on Kennedy.  Hey, it was what, a hundred yards, 200 yards.  That's any military guy can take that shot.  It's, it's not as impossible as they've made it seem over the years.  Well, I, I haven't examined the angles and everything else.  Right.  But now for just the distance, which I think it's actually only a hundred yards or less. 
[00:17:00]  Now it, that's easy shot.  When you, um, what, what, was there ever a time when you had to shoot somebody and you  looked at them through the scope and there was, it was like, I don't want to do this  one for whatever reason.  Definitely.  I've passed on shots before.  And there's times to where you just, you don't think it's the right thing to do.  So you don't take a shot.  I passed up a kid coming out to pick up an RPG.  I know my rules of engagement said that I was supposed to kill this kid because it's 
[00:17:30]  a, uh, crew served weapon, RPG belt fed machine gun, you know, grenade mortars.  I'm supposed to kill the person carrying that.  But at that point, I could not convince myself that this kid, knowing that he's going to  take it back to someone else to use against me, he's not the one that's going to use it.  So I couldn't take that shot.  You said, you said something fascinating in there.  There's people walking around right now that have no idea that you've passed up the shot.  I've passed up a bunch of shots.  I don't know how lucky they are to be alive. 
[00:18:00]  They're just walking around right now having no idea that they, their head was it or their  body mass was in a scope.  There was also times seeing a person knowing they're bad.  Right.  And because of my rules of engagement, witnessed them actually commit something that triggered  me hot, but I couldn't take the shot because when I saw them again, they didn't have the  weapon.  What triggered me hot?  Do you, yeah, do you use that in your...  I cleared hot.  I was allowed to take the shot.  Do you use that in your, like, regular life, joking around sexually when you get, you 
[00:18:30]  know, trigger me hot, baby, live action.  You're just joking around.  Yeah.  You're just joking around.  My wife is kind of sick of the military.  Trying to leave the lingo out.  Only non-military zeros do that.  Military guys don't do that.  They just fuck.  We're the ones who want to sound like we're real men.  There's someone on the line saying that you were in a bar fight with Jesse.  Ventura.  Is that true?  Yes.  You were?  Oh, shit.  Oh, let's get into this. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah, I would like to.  Do you talk about it?  How do you explain it?  He and I had a very unplayed.  No, but he used to come on our show and it was all right.  We didn't agree with a lot of the stuff he said, but we had an okay time.  Thank you for your service.  Then we had a moment where he walked off our show because we just killed him with knowledge.  Yeah.  We really did.  A big argument.  Especially Jimmy.  I wanted to ask how you felt about him as a SEAL, but if you had a bar fight, were you  stressing the difference between UDT or what happened?  Being UDT, I fully respect that.  SEALs were born out of UDT, so I consider him, yes, he's a SEAL. 
[00:19:30]  Yes.  Part of the family.  I don't draw a distinction between them.  Okay.  What happened in the bar?  Yeah, what happened?  You were in a bar and...  Oh, Jesus.  We had just come back from our 06 deployment when we lost our guys.  We were having a wake for the guy who got the Medal of Honor, Mikey Monsoor, and he happened  to be there.  He was coming in for a graduating BUDS class that he was going to speak to, and he was upset  with the war. 
[00:20:00]  He doesn't agree with it, which is fine.  You don't have to agree with the war.  I just get sent there.  I don't have to agree with politics.  I signed up to serve the country.  The country tells me what to do.  Mm-hmm.  He was making it known that he did not agree with it, and I approached him and said, hey,  you know...  It's not the place.  I appreciate it, but we are having a wake.  It was the SEAL bar there in town.  I said, we're having a wake here.  The family's here.  I would appreciate it if you just kind of keep it down.  He told us that we were killing innocent people over there, men, women, children, that 
[00:20:30]  we were murderers, and I said, you know what?  We can all have our differences.  That's fine, but please just don't upset the family.  Yeah.  And then he said that, you know, we deserve to lose a few guys.  Oh, boy.  Holy shit.  Jesse said that?  Yes.  What the fuck is wrong with him?  So, by the way, all you guys out there that attacked me because I fucking attacked him,  good.  I'm glad to hear that.  He really is a douche.  And what happened when he said that to you?  Did you grab his ponytail?  No.  You slugged him? 
[00:21:00]  Good.  I punched him.  I punched him.  Good for you.  Where'd you punch him?  Bravo.  In the face.  What happened?  That's when you take a head shot.  Well, I mean, Jesse Ventura, he's...  A big man.  He's an older guy, too.  Yeah, he's an older guy.  Of course, all the guys then started making fun of me.  So, what geriatric are you going to be at today?  I am quite a bit.  When you hit him, did he hit you back, or...?  No, he went down.  Oh!  Like, was he...  I don't think he was out.  It definitely took him off balance.  He went down, and... 
[00:21:30]  But the ref wasn't looking.  They never are.  Did his walker fall with him?  Yeah, I think he fell out of his wheelchair.  He's a big dude, bro.  Wow, he went down.  He's a big dude.  He's a fucking...  He's still Jesse the Body.  I mean, he's an older guy, but he's still a big, strong guy.  Did he awkwardly get up and have to walk out of the place?  I don't know.  I took off running because the cops were already outside, and as soon as I hit him, I knew  a SEAL party, SEAL bar.  Cops were watching.  They saw the whole thing happen, so I took off running.  Oh, yeah.  So, Jesse Ventura said to a SEAL at a bar where there was a wake for a SEAL, you deserve to 
[00:22:00]  lose a few guys.  Yes, he did.  Repugnant.  You make me even happy, because he and I got into a very, very nasty exchange, because  I was defending kind of action.  Al-Qaeda.  Yes, and I said, you know what?  They're nice people, Jesse.  No, I said that I kind of agreed with the Afghanistan action, and he was saying that I'm just a guy  who didn't serve, who was for the war, and I'm like, but that's not where I'm coming  from.  I'm not saying fucks, just go out and fight. 
[00:22:30]  It wasn't at all.  So, we just got into an ugly thing, and it got personal, and he's a douche, but he really  hates my guts, so I'm so happy you did that, because I'm not a man.  Like, I couldn't stand up and punch him.  What happened was, as we kept arguing, he patted me on the back hard, and I knew he was like,  as he was leaving, he's like, thanks for your service, but it was like one of those, and  for me to match him, I would have had to pat it, and I'm like, I'm not going to do what  you did.  I wish I was him, though.  How great would that have been to just slug him, so I insulted him.  Yeah, I'm sure I just caught him off balance on a trip. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah, that must have been it, sure.  Good for you, man.  That must have been it.  Is this, when you, what is this book, this book focuses on your entire life, or is it  mostly about the military, or is it about your experiences over in Iraq?  It's mainly about my experiences in Iraq.  It has some of my upbringing about being a cowboy for a living, and then going into the  military, but it's trying to concentrate on my relationship with my wife, and the sacrifices  that we went through as a couple, not just as SEAL, but any military member would go 
[00:23:30]  through.  Now, you said you were a cowboy for a living.  Before you went into the military, you were like a cattle rustler?  Rustler.  Not a rustler.  That's a hanging out of that.  Was that Sean Wayne?  Is that from Mexico and steal cattle?  Is that proper terminology?  No, cattle rustler is steal cattle.  Oh, no, I meant Wrangler.  Wrangler, not rustler.  Wrangler.  Why did you just use your hand to make a lasso?  Oh, my God.  Jimmy just made a lasso move with his hand.  Because I was trying to.  Oh, Jimmy.  He's just trying to relate to that.  I was trying to show him that he's not the only one that has experienced cattle. 
[00:24:00]  He's a baby seal.  I did do that, by the way.  And if you would have knocked my teeth out, nobody would have faulted you.  Oh, God.  The only weird part is when you were doing the lasso, you were moving your hips, too.  Yeah, because he wrestles cattle with a hula hoop on it.  Like, I tied my shirt in a little knot like a prison girl.  So, where were you brought up that you were doing that?  Brought up in Texas.  Born and raised there.  All right.  Definitely, we always had cattle and horses.  Yeah.  I was working on ranches all through high school. 
[00:24:30]  Went to college.  Kept working on ranches.  After I quit college, I decided I want to be a cowboy for a living.  Wow, so you were on a horse from the time you were a kid, though.  Yes, I started riding early age.  See, we've got a lot in common.  Yeah, you kind of do.  Except, you know, I didn't make any commitment whatsoever to anything.  He would often act like a man, and you pretended you were Popeye.  He's living with somebody his age. 
[00:25:00]  He doesn't have to do a big Christmas every year.  Chris, you're obviously out of the military, right?  Yes.  So what do you do for a living now?  Because you're a young guy.  How old are you?  37.  37.  And have all this experience behind you.  What do you do now?  Kraft International is the name of the company.  That we're still providing training to the military.  Oh, that's good, yeah.  You know, I can't be in the military anymore to save my marriage, so this is my way of still giving back, trying to prepare guys before they go overseas. 
[00:25:30]  And, I mean, we're not claiming to have, hey, you come to ours and you're going to be 100% successful, but here's a tool for your toolbox.  Maybe it'll come in handy when you're down there, and we can also provide security.  We do a lot of the anti-piracy stuff and personal protection here stateside.  How did you deal with being away from your wife and family for so long?  Like, what was the longest you've been away from them?  Eight or nine months.  Jesus.  Yeah, you get used to it.  It's the job.  That's your way of life. 
[00:26:00]  But you're out there a lot, you know.  I mean, Jimmy went over there.  I went over there a couple times.  And there's guys that are on the base a lot and get to use the, you know, they have a lot of, I mean, the bases in Iraq were, I thought it was going to suck,  but they had Skype and great food, and it was kind of, it wasn't as bad as you think it would be.  But you're not, you know, in there all the time.  You're out in some fucking house waiting for some douche to walk out with a grenade, you know.  So how do you deal with not, I mean, I get homesick after a couple weeks being on the road. 
[00:26:30]  I couldn't imagine nine months.  Give me space.  I'm serious.  I do know, but it was just funny watching you go through that process.  It's almost like watching you go through.  I wasn't sure if you were going to ask a question.  You're somehow relating his being a sniper in Iraq to the stand-up tour at the Wilbur Theater.  You know, do I understand what you're saying?  Because sometimes I'll have to stop at an Arby's, and I don't know what it's going to be.  I'm going to be away from home for two days.  It's killing me.  That's exactly what I'm saying.  Two weeks from me away from home, I'm fucking freaking. 
[00:27:00]  I couldn't imagine nine months.  And then over there.  Oh, you'd definitely miss them.  My wife would send me DVDs so I could see my kids growing up.  Jesus.  And I'd be able to call, and you try to call to when everyone's going to be awake, and  you can actually talk to the kids, or it depends on how young they are, she can just put it  there so you can hear them grunt or whatever.  That is odd that they got that now.  Like, you think back at World War II and the Korean War, Vietnam. 
[00:27:30]  Like, imagine having that type of connection with your family, even though it sucks, you're  away from them, but having that kind of connection through Skype or something back then.  Dude, over there, I thought it was going to be just tents and, you know, mud.  I mean, the mess halls were fucking like a Vegas buffet.  Like, I mean, it was crazy.  I thought me and Colin, the fatties that we were, because he was fat back then, too,  we thought we were going to starve.  So we, like, brought, like, little bars and stuff. 
[00:28:00]  Like, there's going to be no food.  There was more.  I gained 30 pounds in Iraq.  There was, you go to the buffet, there's Chinese food, mac and cheese, barbecue, pizza, ice cream.  You could walk up to this ice cream and get as many ice cream bars and sundaes as you wanted.  Yeah, were you privy to that?  No.  No.  You went to the big, nice bases.  Yeah.  Were you Air Force, Bobby?  We went over to the Air Force, had the best food, I think.  Oh, they do?  Oh, the Air Force was the best base ever. 
[00:28:30]  Yeah.  They had a fucking room with, like, just computers, pool tables, and, like, video games.  Wow.  In the middle of the desert, in the middle of fucking nowhere.  Yeah.  And then we went to the Marine base that had, you know, they did have, like, just a tub full  of shit.  That's usually what you eat.  Yeah.  It was a little weird.  It was a little, it was definitely, it was in the middle of nowhere, 20 miles off the  Syrian border.  I got off the plane with my two light sticks, because I was scared, because it was so dark  out, and the guy starts yelling at me, you want to get shot in the head? 
[00:29:00]  Put those light sticks away.  What are you doing?  And they could explain why other people had handed you those light sticks.  And they said, look, when you get off the plane, just wave them wildly.  Call him.  Call him and said, you look like a plane landing a plane.  But he didn't live like that.  He was out in the field.  I have to ask, and I'm embarrassed to ask this, but where did you poop?  That would drive me nuts.  No, if you're out in the field, though.  Like, you walk around the city, you can't find a place to take a dump. 
[00:29:30]  That's a good idea.  Most of the restaurants won't allow you to go in.  You poop in a hole.  Usually, you have your MREs with you, and you crap in the bag.  Oh, they give a bag to shit in?  Well, the MREs come in a bag.  Usually, after you eat your meal, you just hang on to that bag.  Those are just for meals ready to eat.  Yes.  And then what do you do with me?  You leave the bag behind, I hope, right?  You're not carrying out your own poop.  You're supposed to take everything out.  Are you serious?  You didn't, though, right?  Is it like camping?  It's not camping? 
[00:30:00]  No, you're pooping wherever you can.  People are shooting at me.  Excuse me, I'm going to leave my shit here.  Someday on a rooftop.  Imagine the cranky ass you would have on a rooftop after pooing in a bag.  Wow, yeah.  But the beauty is somebody's going to find a bag of his shit six months from now on a roof.  That is kind of a fucking great feeling.  Probably using his fuel.  I'd love to do that here in the city.  Bags of shit on the apartments?  All right.  We're just getting stupid at this point.  Yeah, absolutely.  Fascinating talking to you.  Yeah, absolutely.  The book looks unbelievable.  I wish I'd have more time to read it.  Good sense of humor, too, Chris.  Well, thanks.  I was trying to portray my actual personality in the book to show people that I am just an average guy. 
[00:30:30]  I like to cut up and don't take myself too serious.  And there's so many guys out there that are a lot better than me, so I'm not trying to portray myself as the world's greatest sniper.  I just happen to be in certain situations, and I made some lucky shots and came out okay.  Do you find just what's worse than regular civilians who you know never did military service trying to relate to you on that level? 
[00:31:00]  Like, you know, we'll ask questions shamelessly.  Like, shamelessly, yes.  But when a guy tries to...  Like girls.  But, I mean, how insulting is that when a guy tries to relate to you like he knows and he has no idea what he's talking about?  You get it every day.  You just get used to it.  You do, right?  Yeah, it's...  I mean, everybody's curious.  There's certain areas of life that I don't have any experience with that I'm sure I annoy the hell out of people who keep asking questions about that.  But you could snap their neck.  Yeah.  He's a sniper. 
[00:31:30]  He's not a kung fu expert.  Well, look, you know what?  Did you see it?  Probably some military trial or something.  It kind of looks like he could be, you know...  Martial arts training?  Yeah.  Why don't you challenge it, Bobby?  So what's...  Exactly.  I feel like you could snap your neck.  I'll beat him an Xbox.  That barracks ice cream eating that you were talking about.  Yeah.  I was over there.  I had two milkshakes.  One of the Marines goes, you're going to have both of those, Fatty?  So I gave him one, and then my other one fell.  I had to go back and get two more. 
[00:32:00]  You asshole.  That's fantastic.  But do you know when you walked out with two milkshakes, the other guy's probably looking at you and going, that's what we're fighting for.  And then they all deserting.  That's why they call it deserting.  Bobby was deserting.  You just put it together.  You just put it together.  All right.  Let's get Chris on.  He's a very busy guy.  Yes, Chris.  Thanks so much, man.  Thank you very much.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  We'll have more of Opie and Anthony's red, white, and boo. 
[00:32:30]  Get it?  It's supposed to be blue.  Ugh.  Memorial Day special when we get back.  You're listening to Red, White, and boo!  The worst of Opie and Anthony Memorial Day special.  More coming up.  Yeah, red, white, and boo!  The worst of Opie and Anthony Memorial Day special continues.  Here's your host, comedian and guy who went to a rock once, Bob Kelly. 
[00:33:00]  Hey, it's Robert Kelly.  And I'm using a fucking bandana right now in an air-conditioned studio to wipe my fat forehead off because I'm sweating.  And I'm hosting the Opie and Anthony red, white, and boo Memorial Day weekend special.  Our horrible attempt at saluting those who have served their country proudly.  We continue with Chris Kyle.  This time, conspiracy radio host Alex Jones claims that Kyle is lying about punching Jesse Ventura.  We get them both on the phone because that's the way we roll. 
[00:33:30]  Controversy.  We're not afraid.  Hit the button.  Put them through.  Go at it.  We'll mediate.  We put them both on the phone so Alex can confront Chris.  And you know what happened?  Ha-ha!  You're going to have to listen.  Some crazy shit.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  Hi, Chris.  How are you?  What's up, Chris?  How much?  How y'all doing?  Well, you told the story on our show that you punched Jesse Ventura in a bar.  And wow, the story took off, man. 
[00:34:00]  Was this the first place you'd ever told that story publicly?  Well, yes.  I mean, for a big audience like that.  I mean, the event is in the book, but I purposely left his name out because I didn't want that  whole thing to take off like that.  And then ever since then, I've been trying to kind of deflect questions from it because  I'm not trying to make money off of putting him down or anything.  Yeah.  We got a tip that it was Jesse Ventura.  We asked you and you decided to say yes to that and admit it was Jesse Ventura because 
[00:34:30]  like you said in the book, it's very vague.  You said you punched a guy, a fuzzy-faced guy, was it?  Was that the exact thing?  Yeah, scruffy face.  Scruffy face.  Right, right.  Well, a lot of people are now calling you a liar.  I believe you, by the way.  Yeah, so do I.  Yeah, so far we believe you, absolutely.  They can call me wherever they want because I know this thing has gotten so blown up that  the only way to actually put it to rest is the witnesses. 
[00:35:00]  I have asked them to stay out of it where finally now I've said, you know what, just go  ahead and come out with it.  Oh, okay.  Put this behind us.  Oh, you have actually asked them to speak up because there was audio we heard of Ventura,  of course.  You probably heard it too, where he's denying ever meeting you and he's harping on the fact  that a crime has been committed and maybe he should file charges.  Yeah.  He definitely should if he thinks that's right. 
[00:35:30]  Do you regret it at all?  You know what?  I wish I would have handled it differently.  I mean, I don't.  I mean, the story, I think, definitely needed to be in the book like it is.  But as far as, yeah, I probably should have played it down to where his name didn't get  out there.  But you know what?  It is now.  So I'm.  What exactly happened, Chris?  If you could just refresh, because a lot of people might not have heard you on that moment.  Just if you could give us a brief, just kind of sum the story up so people know what we're 
[00:36:00]  talking about.  It was a wake for Mikey Monsoor.  And of course, all the families were there.  And he was there.  I started getting loud and voicing his opinion coming out against the war and the troops  and everything.  So we asked him to keep it down.  And he got belligerent about it and finally said we deserve to lose a few.  Yeah, that's way over the line.  Now, was he he was there. 
[00:36:30]  This was in a bar, just so people know.  Yes, it was the outside patio portion of a bar and we were standing on the sidewalk of  it.  Now, was he with anybody or was he alone to your knowledge?  No, I mean, he was definitely there at the bar with people.  Oh, he was with people.  So there's a few people that saw this.  Oh, there's a bunch of people that saw this.  Yeah.  And they've they've spoken about it like in smaller circles over the years.  It's not like this has been a complete secret.  Oh, no.  I mean, the entire community has known about this. 
[00:37:00]  And there's a room like there's a radio guy who's friends with Jesse Ventura, who thinks  that we all scripted this together.  I guess because we just happened to look over.  Yeah.  And at the instant feedback, which is the one time instant feedback actually, you know,  gave us something helpful.  Actually, actually, it was a phone call.  A phone call.  OK.  It seemed like it might have been someone that really knows Chris Kyle and was kind  of just, you know, hoping that you were finally going to mention the name.  But Alex Jones says that it's a conspiracy.  We were in on the conspiracy, even though we just met you that morning. 
[00:37:30]  And by the way, we thought you were awesome.  Yeah.  We think you're the greatest.  People love you on the show, man.  And they also Alex Jones also says we scripted the whole thing.  So we helped you along and we we got together and we we came up with this whole thing.  Like, right, I've heard all those rumors.  Jesse was the wrestler.  He did the scripted stuff, not right.  Not other people.  And also, I love how Chris Kyle is admitting that he told us first because Bill O'Reilly  took this fucking story and stole it from us.  That cocksucker. 
[00:38:00]  That cocksucker.  Yeah.  He kind of ran with it like he just whatever.  Well, we got we got Alex Jones on the line, too.  He wants in on this.  You cool with that, Chris?  Definitely.  All right.  Hey, Alex.  Hey, guys.  Hey, Alex.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  Hey, I like the show.  Also, I like Norton when he's on the boneyard.  Thank you very much, man.  Don't kiss ass right now.  Well, we got to kiss people.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Let's not kiss anyone's ass right now. 
[00:38:30]  All right.  Hey, hey.  I actually listen to that channel.  I mean, so I'm just saying I listen to it.  You're kissing a little ass because you know you're in a tough spot right now, sir.  Why did you call us liars and why did you say that we were in on a conspiracy with Chris Kyle and that we scripted this thing?  Okay.  Well, number one, I'm not in a tough place.  I was just trying to be friendly.  I just woke up about 15 minutes.  No, no, no.  You're in a tough place.  No, I'm not in a tough place.  Jesse Ventura lied on your show.  Simplewars.com.  Jesse Ventura lied on your show, sir.  Alex, so what happened? 
[00:39:00]  You thought that we scripted this with Chris Kyle, which is ludicrous.  What are you thinking there?  No, let me tell you what I meant by that.  I'm saying the way he was talking, you know, and somebody calls in with it, and the way he was talking, I think it was scripted.  I did not think and did not say that I thought you guys were in on the lie.  I was watching your face on the video, and it looks like you're, you know, there believing it and hearing it for the first time.  So you guys aren't even on the radar screen as far as I'm concerned with this whole deal, but I know Jesse pretty damn well and see him get tears in his eyes and stuff when he talks to troops in airports and stuff. 
[00:39:30]  I mean, quite frankly, if he sees troops, he runs over or they run over to him, and it goes on and on, and it's the same thing about it's the politicians that have sent you, and it's wrong, and it's terrible what's happening to you and all this stuff.  So when I heard him talk about punching him and knocking him down, I thought, well, that sounds wild but could be true, but as soon as he said the thing on O'Reilly and stuff about, yeah, he said you deserve to die. 
[00:40:00]  You guys deserve to die when the family's right there.  That is made up, period.  I knew it was bull then, and guaranteed.  Ventura, I've never even heard him.  After I did that interview the other day on Skype, he was like, I heard him like almost crying in the background, and his wife totally angry.  So believe me, Ventura's not getting ready to depose people and go absolutely ape over nothing.  He doesn't have people over there at that McPee's place getting affidavits signed and stuff for nothing. 
[00:40:30]  Totally made up.  So you have no doubt that Chris Kyle did not punch Jesse Ventura.  No, what I just said is I was going back to when I watched the video last week.  Did Chris Kyle punch Jesse Ventura or not?  Well, let me just stop you right there.  Ventura denies that it ever happened.  And do you believe that?  Absolutely.  But what I'm telling you is watching the video, knowing Ventura, okay, knowing him well, I'm watching the video, and the guy's saying, you know, he was talking about the war and punched him. 
[00:41:00]  I'm thinking, well, that might have happened.  But when he gets to the part about, yeah, he said the SEALs deserve to die, and when he said it on O'Reilly, it looked really scripted by him.  You know, he was following a script.  I knew it was pure bull.  And as soon as I talked to Ventura, as soon as I could get a hold of him, sure enough, he was completely dumbfounded.  Hold on, Alex, we've got to jump in a little bit, because don't forget, Chris is not a public figure, so he's not used to speaking publicly.  So when he's talking about things that he's not used to talking about on Bill O'Reilly, a show he's probably watched for 10 years, it might be a little bit more nerve-wracking. 
[00:41:30]  And we do have Chris here to respond to that.  We have to let him respond.  Chris, how do you feel?  We'll get to respond in court.  I mean, right now, Chris?  Yeah, that's fine.  I mean, I've got the people that are definitely going to come out, and some of them are the family members that were there, so I'm not too concerned.  And, Chris, what did he say about the Navy SEALs dying?  I think that that's being misquoted.  Yeah, you are misquoting it, Alex.  What did he say, Chris?  He said you deserve to lose a few. 
[00:42:00]  Deserve to lose a few.  Yeah, that means deserve to die.  Well, it does.  What it means and what was said.  You've been misquoting the man the whole time you've ever...  Hey, Kyle, you think you're going to make a big name for your new American mercenary force to help knock heads of American people?  Think again.  I know all about Richard Perl, all about your trips to Israel, all of it, buddy boy.  Who is Richard Perl?  What is...  Who is Richard Perl?  You're more entertaining, Alex.  I'll give you that. 
[00:42:30]  Who is Richard Perl?  Yeah, it'll all come out.  And by the way, Alex, we're not giving you...  Who is Richard Perl?  And we're also not giving you Perry Mason stuff and playing semantics games.  The difference...  To me, it's more believable for Jesse Ventura to say, you guys deserve to lose a few, than to say something as harsh as, I'm glad Navy SEALs are dying.  There is a difference in believability in what one guy would say.  And I don't think Jesse Ventura would come out and go, I'm glad a soldier's dead.  Look, that's the same thing.  And that's how...  No, it's not!  ...telling it, that he was...  You know, that he's saying the Navy SEALs deserve to lose a few. 
[00:43:00]  That is saying, lose a few means die.  It absolutely does.  But there is a difference in the way you say it.  One is more believable to me.  Well, Chris, listen, I hope for your sake that you are telling the truth.  And, you know, I mean, Ventura's so freaked out by this, he's saying, you know, do they have a body double of me or something?  I mean, I talked to him often.  That's paranoia.  He is completely, he is completely flummoxed and dumbfounded.  I'm flummoxed and dumbfounded.  Chris, were you tempted to put Jesse's name in the... 
[00:43:30]  Because, Alex, one thing that makes this more believable to me is that Chris did not put the name in the book.  The publisher probably said he couldn't prove it.  The publisher...  Now, Chris Kyle is saying today, Alex, that he can prove this.  And a lot of the guys that know about this, he finally told them, yeah, you could tell everyone what you saw that day.  Okay, well, that's not what the owner of the bar is going to say.  Now, Chris, why didn't you put it in the book, honestly?  Because I didn't want this whole reaction to come out here. 
[00:44:00]  Yeah, see?  I'm not trying to sell my book off of making someone else look bad.  And, Alex, is it possible, because we heard you calling, Chris, you called it the turkey shoot.  Is it possible that your agenda...  Look, you don't like the war, it's common knowledge, and you love Jesse.  Isn't it possible that your agenda is skewing the way you're looking at this?  Well, yeah.  I mean, we all see through rose-colored glasses.  And, you know, I'm a Texan.  I mean, I'm sure Kyle at some point is a friendly guy. 
[00:44:30]  My whole issue here is when I say turkey shoot, not that I follow too much of this military stuff,  but I love families in the military.  And, of course, there's the big joke about, you know, the Hadjies don't know how to aim a gun.  My God.  You know, there were people there who couldn't believe the kill numbers everybody was getting.  And when you're shooting women running around with hangar nades and you're shooting, I mean,  plus there's all the contractor footage of them playing Elvis music and shooting whole families out of their cars  and then dropping AK-47s on them. 
[00:45:00]  I mean, that's the big joke.  Every armored vehicle, and Kyle knows this, is full of drop guns.  And they splatter a whole bunch of people at a checkpoint or whatever, dropping AK-47s on them.  You all get, you know, bronze stars for kills in combat.  I'm not saying that's exactly what Kyle did, but it's all well known about Iraq.  Kyle, how do you respond?  The Iranian war started.  Yeah, you were over there.  You must have seen it, Alex, right?  Kyle, how do you respond to that?  You've got to let Kyle respond.  You can't make an accusation like that and not let Kyle respond.  He's got to respond.  Kyle?  Oh, Chris, I'm sorry.  No problem. 
[00:45:30]  We've never had drop weapons on us, but I can tell you as far as the book,  it's not sitting there trying to glorify all the people I've killed.  It's trying to get across the sacrifices that a military member has to go through while he's overseas.  And at the same time, my wife is telling the sacrifices she went through while here at home,  and I'm trying to highlight the heroes that surrounded me that made me look good.  And all through the book, I downplay myself.  And one thing you said, Chris, too, when you were on,  is that people were trying to inflate the number to two-something.  And, Alex, you didn't hear the interview, but Chris kept going, 
[00:46:00]  no, no, no, I'm happy with it.  This is fine.  Like, I don't need any more numbers attributed to me.  He was downplaying everything that day.  And on your show...  Let me be clear.  I think in war, a sniper is an honorable position.  People always try to make it look bad.  I've interviewed a lot of snipers like Colonel Craig Roberts and others when he did in Vietnam.  And I'm not downplaying that, you know, that Chris can't shoot a gnat off a fence post at 1,000 yards.  I'm simply saying that it's well known, just like with the Army helicopter shooting up the Reuters van, 
[00:46:30]  that as far as turkey shoot goes, there were times when you just have all sorts of mayhem  and people being blasted in all directions.  And it's a lot easier to be a sniper in the desert or in those built-up mount areas than it was in, say, Southeast Asia.  I mean, that's my point about turkey shoot.  Clearly, Kyle, would it have been harder to make 1,000-yard, 2,000-yard shots in Vietnam in the jungle  or from a rooftop into a desert? 
[00:47:00]  Oh, I am not claiming my war is any harder than Vietnam.  And I give the Vietnam vets all the props because they definitely fought a harder war.  And I give Carlos Hathcock all the credit as being the greatest sniper to have ever lived.  That's all I was saying, guys.  Okay, something you said, too, which I thought was a little unfair.  You said that Chris was bragging about shooting women.  And the way you painted that, and we played the audio, was that here is this guy going over to Iraq  and he's coming back acting like he's hot shit for killing women.  But when Chris described that shoot, he was really specific. 
[00:47:30]  He was bothered by it.  About being bothered.  I read quotes, and in fairness, the media does take things out of context where it's talking about...  No, you take things out of context because you made it sound like he was bragging about shooting women.  But he didn't brag.  When if you listened to the actual interview and not transcripts, you would have heard Chris Kyle being very bothered by the fact that he shot a woman.  I don't have time to watch the entire interview.  All I saw was like a three-minute clip on the Internet.  No, no, we understand that.  But we're saying when you're quoting something and you're painting this guy, there's a big difference there. 
[00:48:00]  You were painting him as this cavalier ass who was bragging about shooting a woman.  And what he was telling us, Chris, I think, is that you made absolutely sure she had a grenade.  You could see it through your scope.  You were being told, yes, you have to take her out because she's walking towards Marines.  Like, he saved U.S. soldiers' lives.  But the way you painted him...  All I'm saying is this.  Even Dallas Morning News said there's something creepy, and I'm not even saying this about Kyle, about on TV constantly, you know, especially the host and people smacking their lips. 
[00:48:30]  And maybe that's where I'm picking this up.  You guys didn't really do that.  But some of the other shows getting all excited, you know, tell us more about killing the people.  Tell us more.  And it's just, at a certain point, it's disgusting, and I don't want to hear about it.  And I'm not saying Kyle's even bad for that.  It's true.  Now that I've seen more of the interviews with him, he's not the one getting off on it.  Some of the hosts are.  And I just know all the people I know from Vietnam, World War II and places will never even talk about it. 
[00:49:00]  So I'm just saying, hearing all of this stuff...  I mean, I remember one time I was at the deer camp, and I was about 10 years old.  There were all these old World War II vets there in Buffalo, Texas, you know, just south of Dallas where we've got a ranch.  And I know Kyle's from that general area, and I'm sitting there pulling on their leg at 5 a.m.  while they're cooking business in gray before we go hunting.  Tell me a war story.  Tell me a war story.  Tell me a war story.  And one old guy who was a tank commander going into Germany said, okay, there was this woman who looked like Marilyn Monroe, 
[00:49:30]  walked up and opened up her trench coat and pulled out a rifle, so we cut her in half.  Now there's your story.  Don't ask me anymore.  I understand that war is ugly.  I've got all that stuff.  All I know is I don't believe that Jesse Ventura said, you deserve to lose a few, unless he was drunk.  And the problem is Jesse hasn't had alcohol in like 15 years because of blood clots.  He has to take medicine for blood clots.  And I know Kyle's saying, now that I've seen him on O'Reilly, that he wasn't drinking. 
[00:50:00]  All I know is that the Jesse Ventura I know does not talk about the troops.  And always says, I mean, it's a line, you know, he says the same stuff over and over again, that the troops are heroes.  It's not their fault.  It's the military, you know, it's the politicians' fault for failing and sending them there and lying about WMDs.  And so when Chris says that, I mean, and again, right now he sounds like a nice guy.  So I'm completely blown away by this because Ventura sounds credible.  You know, Kyle, you know, right now sounds calm and nice. 
[00:50:30]  And I mean, I don't know what kind of psy-op this is or what this is, but let me just tell you, it's a big deal.  Well, okay, we do have a problem because Chris Kyle's saying it happened and Jesse Ventura's saying it didn't happen.  Yeah, exactly.  And we heard some audio of you and you said that you don't even believe Jesse Ventura was in the bar that day because he doesn't drink.  Well, yeah, that was probably then like last Thursday or Friday before I talked to Jesse. 
[00:51:00]  And then Jesse says, yes, I was there for graduation, but I wasn't there speaking.  It was something about numbers that are the same as another class.  Yeah, we heard that part.  So you think Chris Kyle's lying?  I don't believe that Jesse Ventura said you deserve to lose a few names.  No, no, no.  All right, fair enough.  But do you think Chris Kyle punched Jesse Ventura and knocked him down?  I told you that when I first was sitting there, you know, they come in during a break when I was on the radio like last Thursday and they said, have you seen this, you know, from the L.P. and Anthony show? 
[00:51:30]  And I said, no, seen one.  They said, here it is.  They pulled it up on screen and I started watching it.  And he says, you know, he was in there talking about the war, blah, blah, blah.  And I thought, oh, well, maybe there was a fight.  And then when he gets to the part about, you know, you deserve to lose a few, I was like, that's a bunch of bull.  And so that was my initial response is that I can imagine Jesse Ventura, you know, sometime making somebody angry, talking bad about the war and some type of altercation ensuing. 
[00:52:00]  But the part about him saying that, I cannot see that happening.  And now that Jesse denied it, I have to believe Jesse.  And let me tell you, Jesse's so shocked that other Navy SEAL would say something like this because he thinks they're all honorable.  That, you know, off air, he even said some of it on air.  He's like, my God, Alex, do you think like they had a double in there?  This is some type of psy-op.  Now, Chris, is it possible that you and Jesse were arguing or you were debating and he said something to the effect of, it's only natural you're going to lose a few? 
[00:52:30]  Or are you 100% sure that he said it and with the intention that you heard it?  No.  I feel the opinion that he said exactly what I thought he heard.  Some other guys that were standing right there.  Oh, they heard it as well?  And I feel horrible about it coming out the way it had, and I'm sorry I handled it the way I did on your show. 
[00:53:00]  I guess I should have just denied it and said, I don't know what you're talking about.  And I had no idea.  And after all this has come out, I've listened to different interviews of people trying to, you know, say I'm lying and everything.  I had no idea.  And Mr. Ventura was thinking about public office, doing all this other stuff.  I honestly have no idea who this Pearl guy is.  But, so, no, I'm not part of some bigger thing trying to discredit him.  And, yeah, I feel bad that now all of a sudden all this attention is on this.  And I'm trying to get a story out there about, hey, y'all look at what the troops have to go through, take notice, and let's take care of these guys. 
[00:53:30]  Well, can I ask you a question?  Definitely.  You're setting up craft, and you say you're going to have basically diplomatic protection, training of law enforcement, all these groups.  You've gotten awards from different international groups.  I didn't know you'd be here, or I'd pull it up.  And, I mean, have you gone to Israel and gotten police training?  No, sir.  So you haven't gotten awards from that American-slash-Israel group that trains domestic U.S. police? 
[00:54:00]  Well, I got a GENSA award, Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs.  That's while I was still active.  That was in 05.  Yeah, well, just so you know, that's Richard Pearl, and he's known as the Prince of Darkness in the Pentagon.  That's his nickname.  But let's just expand on that for a moment.  Do you know about the National Defense Authorization Act and how Congress just abolished the Posse Comitatus Act? 
[00:54:30]  I mean, you're a master sergeant, isn't it?  No, sir.  I was a chief.  Chief.  Okay, a chief sergeant.  I forget all these different titles and names.  I mean, certainly you know what Posse Comitatus is.  What?  Sir, honestly, as far as when it comes to that, I have my business partners because my main concern is running the training side of the business.  I understand.  What is Posse Comitatus?  I don't know what it is.  I'm pretty sure I've caught it twice.  It means no worries for the rest of your days. 
[00:55:00]  Why don't you shut up, Norton, and play the player?  I don't know what Posse Comitatus means.  Okay, that's the 1878 law barring the military from domestic law enforcement.  Oh, okay.  And Kyle, I mean, I'm just curious here.  I mean, this sniper training and stuff, I mean, that's basically paramilitary training for the police, but I know they've had snipers before that.  I'm just saying I see a lot of data points here, and I was thinking maybe somebody had – maybe you had been in an altercation with some big guy who looked like Ventura. 
[00:55:30]  Maybe somebody told you that was Ventura.  Maybe somebody put you up to talking about this, but, you know, listening to you now, you sound dumbfounded.  So I'm dumbfounded, you know, I think that –  Leave the founded part off.  Yeah, yeah.  Is it, Alex?  I mean, is Jesse really that important in the end that we have to take out Jesse Ventura and discredit him?  Okay, well, here's why Jesse's –  It's a question. 
[00:56:00]  I don't know.  Okay, here's something I know isn't true.  100%.  Because I probably talk to Jesse every, you know, few weeks or something, or he gives me a call, ask me about news.  Sorry about that.  Just get Ambien.  But my point is, I talked like two weeks ago.  I called Jesse, and I said, when are you leaving the U.S.?  Are you going to be driving through Texas?  You know, you are in your RV.  Stop by my house.  And he's like, well, I think I'm leaving, you know, in about a week or so.  And he said, but let me call you in the next few days, and I'll come on the radio before I leave town.  I said, great.  Say hi to your wife.  Bye. 
[00:56:30]  Next day, phone rings while I'm on air.  Jesse Ventura's got some breaking news.  He wants to come on.  Now, I've just called him in Minnesota, talked to him.  What happened?  You know, his wife got him off the elliptical machine.  I know he's in Minnesota, and it's all over TMZ, Fox News, that Jesse Ventura is rubbernecking, recklessly driving in California, trying to get to the airport.  Well, Jesse hasn't flown in 16 months.  Anyway, so Jesse's saying, this is crazy.  I think this is some dirty trick, saying I'm, you know, tailgating, being pulled over by police.  I'm here in Minnesota. 
[00:57:00]  So he had to threaten TMZ to retract it.  But so first you have that false story come out, Fox runs with it, and then this other story comes out.  And I'm telling you, if Jesse is lying, he is a better liar than even Herman Cain.  If he's lying, he's one of the best liars I've ever seen.  So that means you're saying Chris Kyle's lying.  Chris, there's no doubt in your mind that you punched Jesse Ventura that day, right?  Yes, sir, definitely.  And, Mr. West, you're a friend of Mr. Ventura's.  I'd be more than happy if you would like to set up a time for me and him, not on the air, me and him, to be able to talk, whether on the phone or in person. 
[00:57:30]  I'll be in California next, or this week, and Vegas the week after.  I'll be more than happy to sit down, me and him talk, and settle this thing.  Wow, that would be a newsworthy event.  Well, why even make it on the news?  I mean, I'm trying to discuss all the questions on this.  He wants this thing to go away.  I fully, 100%, believe I'm telling the truth. 
[00:58:00]  You believe him.  I think him and I could definitely clear the air on this.  Sure.  Well, then I'll tell you what I'll do.  If you can get me your number or your email, I'll give it to Jesse, and I know he's got...  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  How about we do it on our show?  Well, no, I mean, I'm not even...  Whoa, what happened here?  He doesn't want to do it on any show.  How about we do a joint venture, Mr. Alex Jones?  If you want to get them both on together, that's fine.  We bring you Chris Kyle. 
[00:58:30]  You bring us Jesse.  Let's do this.  That's fair.  Okay, I just don't think Jesse...  In a cage.  What?  I'm just trying to keep it from the public eye.  Right, right.  Chris doesn't want a three-ring circus.  Hold on, Alex.  Chris, do you have audio Skype?  Because the only thing that works from where he's at in the Baja is audio Skype to Skype.  There's no phone lines, nothing.  So I can...  I mean, look, I'll just send Jesse an email, and then I'll see if I can give you his Skype ID.  I just need some way to give that to Mr. Kyle. 
[00:59:00]  I do not have Skype.  We'll get it done off air.  You don't want to give it on the air.  We'll do it off air.  That's easy.  We'll just...  Chris, just stay on hold when we finish and talk to our guy.  One more question for Alex Jones.  I don't see the upside of Chris Kyle telling this story, considering his career in the military  and considering his new business there.  Why would he take this chance and put this crazy lie out there?  Look, all I know is his book was already getting quite a bit of attention, but I mean, he got like three or four times the attention. 
[00:59:30]  And, of course, it did kind of distract in a way, but he did get a ton of attention out of this.  Yeah, it sold a lot of books.  We know that.  But in the end, you know, okay, you sell a lot of books, but you destroy your military career.  Well, I know this.  That is what's happening, because I've looked at the different SEAL websites and stuff.  They're all mad and saying, even if this is true, and they're all saying they didn't hear of it happening,  and they think they would have, that this makes it look like SEALs are all talking crap about each other. 
[01:00:00]  And it just makes the SEALs, I mean, even if you believe Ventura said that, it makes it horrible that he'd say he'd lose some,  and it makes it horrible that Chris Kyle would talk about it.  But I can tell by the way you're talking, Chris is not the way you thought, like you originally might have interpreted him.  And I think that you're seeing he's a lot more of a real and believable guy.  Yeah, I mean, in the clips I've seen, especially on your show, I mean, he came off as kind of scripted on O'Reilly,  and I see what you're saying, because he probably was nervous, and so was just thinking about what he was going to say. 
[01:00:30]  Because, I mean, I'm in the media so much, so are you guys, you almost forget you're even on air.  Oh, tell me about it.  You forget you're on air.  I mean, I wish I got butterflies like I did 16 years ago.  And then at the same time, when I saw him on your show, he just seemed kind of like smirky and arrogant,  and, you know, like it was real funny.  And now he doesn't sound like that.  So, I mean, it does sound different.  So, Alex, could you meet Chris maybe 1,000 yards south of the Stratosphere Hotel in Vegas? 
[01:01:00]  Yeah, he'll send you a message.  Hey, by the way, I'm from Texas, too, and I've shot a deer at 1,000 yards.  I haven't shot an Iraqi at 2,600.  Yeah?  Did a deer have a grenade?  Yeah, but with 1,700, 308, I could shoot a deer at 1,000 yards all day long.  You're all man, Alex.  Well, I'm not a Bronco rider.  I mean, I didn't do it professionally like Kyle,  but I did work for a large animal vet for a couple years,  and so I've run the electric D-horners and the Hotshots, 
[01:01:30]  and I've inoculated 1,000 cows in one day.  All right.  I think we're good, but we appreciate you guys.  How many cow arms?  We appreciate you both coming on, and Chris, we'll talk to you off air for a second.  Yeah, we're in a quandary, sir.  I believe Chris.  I believe Chris.  I think that, yeah, hey, look, they had a good discussion, and Chris explained himself.  All right, fair enough.  And, Alex, officially you believe Jesse?  Folks should go to Infowars.com or PritchPlan.com and watch the full interview at Infowars.com 
[01:02:00]  and see who you believe.  Yes, I believe Jesse, but here's the deal, Chris.  I guess I can contact your publisher and try to get your contact so I can put you in touch with Jesse?  Definitely.  Okay, well, then I'll just tell your publisher to, who should I contact with the publisher?  William Morrow.  No, no, but they're going to be getting so many calls.  Wait, do it off air because you're going to have a bunch of names flying around?  Yeah.  We'll get it to you off air, the real name from Chris.  Yeah.  I think it might be Ted Sheckler. 
[01:02:30]  Yeah.  Well, whatever we do.  Yeah, it's Ted Sheckler, Alex.  Because I don't, I mean, this is definitely turning into a mess.  All right, we'll get it figured out.  Yeah, we do it all together, though.  We do it all together nice.  Alex, thank you for coming on.  You bet, thank you.  Take care, buddy.  Chris.  Enjoy the boneyard, all right?  Yes, I appreciate that.  And Chris, if you're not going to be in Phoenix January 27th and 28th when I'm working in Tempe,  I meant to say Tempe at the Improv, talk to our guy off the air and give him your info.  And if he's not going to be in Cleveland, because I'll be at the Improv that weekend, 
[01:03:00]  then he can come to that show.  Love the plugs.  Chris, wow, you created a lot of talk there, sir.  Yes, man.  Thank you for coming on today.  Yeah, thanks for having me, guys.  I don't see why you would lie about this one.  I don't either.  No doubt.  Yeah, so when are these guys coming forward, you think?  The witnesses?  They're starting to now.  They're already talking to other people, getting it all set up, and they're getting them all  together.  Can we help in that way, or how are you guys going to do it? 
[01:03:30]  Because you've got to get it to the media somehow.  That's what we're trying to figure out, the best way to do this.  That way, I'm trying to avoid a three-ring circus.  I'm trying not to defame Mr. Ventura, and I'm kind of trying to knock the legs out from  him.  I'm just trying to get all the guys together.  I gave them the contact person of who they need to get a hold of, and give their story,  and then trying to figure out the best way to come out with this so it doesn't look like 
[01:04:00]  this thing continues on, and we're just here to bash him.  We just want this thing to end and go away.  All right.  There you go.  Thank you, Chris.  We appreciate you calling in today.  Take care, buddy.  We'll talk to you off air.  Thanks, man.  All right.  Chris Kyle, I'm putting you on hold.  Hold on.  Wow.  That's good.  That's cool.  I think Alex hearing him talk knows that this guy is not a bullshitter.  He ain't going to throw his friend under the bus, but you can listen to Chris Kyle.  Yeah, he's in one of those positions where he can't throw his friend under the bus.  You hear that, Alex? 
[01:04:30]  Yes, I'm sitting here.  You heard that, right?  You now believe Chris Kyle after you heard him on our show.  I think you know he's more believable.  No, I think, listen.  Where'd he go?  Oh, no.  In the first interview, he seems concerned.  Hello?  Situation.  I just think this whole thing.  Hello?  Yeah? 
[01:05:00]  Am I even on air because I hear the phone going on and off here?  Are you clicking off because I'm hearing half what you're saying?  Yeah, get a better phone.  It's not our problem.  No, I'm sitting right here.  Psyops.  So I'm sitting right here.  Psyops is going on.  They don't want what you have to say on the air for some reason.  No, I don't think that's what's happening when I sit.  I don't think that's what's happening.  He gives us a proper response.  No, I don't think that's what's happening.  I don't think.  Au contraire.  Infowars.com.  Infowars.com. 
[01:05:30]  All right, Alex.  Enjoy your day soon.  All right, Alex.  I believe Jesse Ventura and it's all going to come out.  All right.  We'll see.  The worst of Opie and Anthony presents Red, White, and Boo.  More, more, more, more must-hear military moments coming up.  Hurry up.  Hey, it's Troy.  I'm kidding.  It's Robert Kelly.  I have a man voice.  And I'm hosting Opie and Anthony's Red, White, and Boo,  our horrible attempt at saluting those who have served their country proudly. 
[01:06:00]  In this segment, we talk to R. Lee Ermey.  You know him as the drill sergeant from Full Metal Jacket,  but he's a former U.S. Marine Corps gunnery sergeant.  That's right.  He's the real fucking deal.  We talk to him about his military service,  but it quickly turns into being all about Full Metal Jacket.  Bye.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  Hooray.  Hooray.  Here's Gunny.  How's everybody doing this morning?  Great.  Fantastic now.  I'm proud of you guys. 
[01:06:30]  Satellite radio is the rage of the age.  I have it in both of my cars.  What do you own?  What kind of cars?  I wouldn't trade it for anything.  What kind of cars?  You got the Willys?  You know, I'm rich, and I've never bought a new car in my life.  I'm just too conservative.  Is that it?  I have an 86 Mercedes SEC that I'm customizing,  customizing, and I have another 450 SL Mercedes that's a 77.  Yeah.  Wow.  But I like the old cars.  You like the older ones? 
[01:07:00]  The new ones are all plastic.  You know that.  What do you listen to on XM?  Everything.  Everything?  Everything.  Did you check out Dylan's show yet?  Uh, don't know.  You have to understand that my time in the car is pretty limited, you know,  and it's from L.A.  from, I live in Palmdale, west of Palmdale, not in the desert.  And why would he listen to that goddamn hippie?  So what I generally tune into is drive time talk political shows.  Right, right.  Because I need to stay abreast of what's going on politically. 
[01:07:30]  Yeah.  I love watching Mail Call.  It's one of my favorites.  It's one of my favorites, too.  Letters, but you get to do some stuff that, I mean, dream come true.  It's the coolest job in the world.  I was telling the guys out there in the green room just a while ago that Monday I spent the entire day down in Tennessee  flying a P-51 Mustang and dogfighting and doing barrel rolls,  and it was a 1945 vintage P-51. 
[01:08:00]  What a fantastic day.  A Mail Call episode.  Nothing came up?  Oh, absolutely not.  I don't do that.  You don't throw up?  You didn't throw up.  It's all mind over matter.  I don't blow chunks.  You know, it would be an embarrassing situation.  It would be.  I've done the F-15.  I've done, you know, so many different airplanes and every helicopter in the military's arsenal.  And if I blew chunks, I...  That would be embarrassing.  It wouldn't invite me back.  No, we've got to introduce you to Bob Kelly, because this guy, all you have to say is whatever, and he'll puke. 
[01:08:30]  Yeah, he's got a weak stomach.  I did the Mustang in California for $1,000.  Marine pilots will take you up 6,000 feet and give you the stick.  And tourgasm.  There you go.  Oh, that was the plane you flew in tourgasm?  Yeah, you basically, you know, you go, go ahead.  I mean, they're still there.  Of course they're there.  You know, you're just doing...  In your case, I wish they would have jumped out with a chute.  Well, actually, it's easy to fly, though.  It's very easy to fly, but literally, it's 6,000 feet.  He goes, you do this to the stick. 
[01:09:00]  The plane goes like that.  You don't puke.  When you come back level, and you see the horizon, and you're still doing this, after doing 4Gs, I threw up twice.  I filled up both bags.  They changed my call sign to snacks to two bags.  Now you know why they charge $1,000.  It'd probably cost half that to get somebody to clean the mess up.  Just to clean it.  Clean the chunks out of the...  My wife is prone to seasickness, car sickness.  And you can't even drive across a bridge without her getting sick. 
[01:09:30]  No.  I got sick in a Chinook.  I went to Iraq to do some comedy, and they take you up in the Chinook helicopters, I think they're called.  With the 50 cals in the window, the open...  It's old school, I'm sure.  Gunny spent enough time in some Chinooks.  Chinooks.  The 46 is my favorite.  The OCH 46.  It's being replaced right now with the Osprey.  Hey, you see what's going on here, by the way?  Bob Kelly's trying to make his puking sound cool.  Yeah, he's trying to toughen up his throwing up in front of Gunny. 
[01:10:00]  I wasn't 6,000 feet.  You saw a woman that had...  You threw up like a man, right?  Let me explain, though.  This week alone, we had a fat girl come in with a hernia sticking out of her belly button.  He puked.  Yeah, he threw up and he looked at it.  I don't know.  I might kind of have a little problem with that myself.  It was a hernia.  You could see the food pulsating through.  Oh, beautiful.  I actually saw her twin winked at me through the hernia.  Kind of like watching a horror show.  I just got to ask you about a little bit of your history and stuff. 
[01:10:30]  How did you get into acting?  What went from the military to acting?  How did you pull that off?  11 years in the Marine Corps.  I was a grunt.  I was an instructor most of my tenure in the Marine Corps and got hurt in Vietnam, got retired out.  I kept showing up for work, but they did retire me, and I've been with the Marine Corps for 45 years.  I'll be with the Marine Corps until I die.  I've been to the Middle East three times, two weeks at a time.  The Marine Corps gives me a couple of helicopters and CH-46 as a rule, and off into the combat zone I go. 
[01:11:00]  I wear the uniform, the black jacket, the Kevlar helmet.  I've seen on Mail Call and other shows where you're in the Middle East, you're with the troops,  and are you surprised and flattered of the respect that you get from these soldiers?  No, I've earned that respect.  I'm part of the Marine Corps.  I take great pride in serving. 
[01:11:30]  I'll never let them down.  I'll always be there for them.  Nothing quite like jumping up on the hood of a humby out in the middle of the combat zone  and getting the troops to laugh at your corny jokes, you know.  The way they treat you, though, is like you've got stars on your shoulders.  That's how you like it.  I don't know.  Because everybody knows me.  I spend about 200 days a year with the military, you know,  and so these guys all know me and they respect me because I treat them as they should be treated with respect.  And how did I get started?  I found myself retired, standing outside the gate of the Marine Corps Recruit Depot in San Diego 
[01:12:00]  with my sea bag at my side, and that's all I owned in this world,  thinking, what the hell am I going to do now because I have no education to speak of?  And then I thought, you know, Hollyweird is just up the road.  Forty miles, I can go to Hollyweird.  I wrote a script, and I was a good instructor.  And in order to keep tired recruits, a thousand recruits, awake and laughing at your corny jokes,  you know, you've got to be pretty on your toes. 
[01:12:30]  So, anyway, I was a good instructor.  I figured, what the heck?  I wrote a script.  I went to Hollywood, and I did comedy clubs for a year.  I was up there doing comedy.  Comedy.  And God help the individual that heckled this.  Yeah.  He gets down in his face.  Talk about driving something up the wrong side of your body.  Yeah.  But that worked out good.  And then one of my buddies, and I was sleeping on people's couches,  and YMCA was good.  Wow.  And I didn't have a car.  Couldn't afford a car.  But a friend of mine told me, hey, Gunny, they're getting ready to do Vietnam War shows over in the Philippines. 
[01:13:00]  So I was single.  I packed my gear and packed up my little sea bag and jumped on Space Available at George Air Force Base  and went back to the Philippines, met the right people, and got involved.  And that's the rest of it's history.  And that movie was?  Full Metal Jacket.  Of course it was.  You're talking Full Metal Jacket.  Of course it was.  That was film number five, by the way.  Was it?  That was film number five.  And in a previous film, I had taken Av. 
[01:13:30]  I was technical advisor.  Oh, Boys and Company C.  Yeah.  I think it was before.  Boys and Company C, Purple Heart, Siege of Firebase Glory, it goes on.  But I was able to take a role away from an actor, and they sent his young, put him on the airplane,  sent his young tail back to Hollywood, and I did his shtick.  Must have been very impressed, yeah.  I knew you could take roles away from actors.  Now, since you weren't an actor walking into that, but you had done stand-up, wasn't that 
[01:14:00]  just a one-shot of you going around the troops at the beginning, giving your speech?  I don't remember seeing a cut.  And you had a lot of dialogue there.  Want to hear it?  Yeah.  Don't doubt.  I'll give you the clean version.  No, you can do it.  Oh, you're okay with the bet?  You can say whatever you want.  Okay, this is not family-related.  No.  It gets nasty.  Okay, here you go.  I am Gunnery Sergeant Ermey.  I am your senior drug instructor.  From now on, you will speak only when spoken to. 
[01:14:30]  The first and last words out of your filthy sewers will be, sir, do you maggots understand that?  Yes, sir.  Bullshit, I can't hear you.  Sound off like you've got a pair.  Yes, sir.  If you ladies leave my island, if you survive recruit training, you will be a weapon.  You will be a minister of death praying for war.  But until that day, you are pukes.  You are scumbags.  You are the lowest form of life on earth.  You are not even human fucking beings.  You are nothing but a lot of little unorganized, gravastic pieces of civilian shit. 
[01:15:00]  My orders are to weed out all non-hackers who do not pack the gear to serve in my beloved  corps.  There is no racial bigotry here.  Here, we do not look down on niggers, kikes, wops, or greasers.  Here, you are all equally worthless.  Is that understood?  Yes, sir.  There you go.  Wow.  That's your stairway to heaven.  That's your stairway to heaven.  Oh, yeah.  That's the first time I've done that in about a year.  I was going to ask.  To see you do that, though, live is like, yeah, Zeppelin. 
[01:15:30]  Let Zeppelin do stairway.  My favorite line in the entire movie was something that I came up with.  I lost my way.  And I'm not the type of guy that will just stop.  I'll continue until I get back on track and then finish the scene.  But my favorite line came out of nowhere, and it was, it will look like the kind of person  that would fuck a person in the ass and not even have the goddamn common courtesy to give  him a reach around.  I'll be watching you.  And Stanley Kubrick jumped off the camera truck and said, Lee, what's a reach around? 
[01:16:00]  Use your imagination, Stanley.  Poor Stanley.  But that was a tremendous show.  I enjoyed doing, I loved doing that show, and I wrote most everything that I did in the  show.  Yeah.  And Texas Chainsaw Massacre, I was allowed to do a lot of ab-libbing.  Great.  So the first, the sheriff, the first time I did the sheriff in the first Texas Chainsaw  Massacre, there really wasn't anything written for the sheriff. 
[01:16:30]  So I had to basically come up with almost everything that we did.  And it got to the point where we would do the scene the way that it was written.  Then the director would say, okay, Lee, do, you do one.  Yeah.  And they would let me do mine.  And it was always mine that showed up in the show.  That's what people want to see, you know?  That's what they want to see out of you.  It worked out great.  Great, man.  Bring your barf bag.  It's a bit hard.  Yeah, there you go.  That's for you.  We had a 15, we had over a $15 million budget, and they tell me half of that was spent on stage 
[01:17:00]  blood.  Now, is it, is it, is it, I know it's gruesome, but is it, is it scary?  I mean, is it, like, I mean, Leatherface was like, oh, man, this guy's coming.  There's a couple things that really bother us psychologically.  One is we would never want to be eaten by an animal, such as a white shark or a tiger.  Right.  You know, you'd be attacked and eaten by an animal.  That sucks.  Pretty horrific.  That really sucks. 
[01:17:30]  Yeah.  And the other thing is being cut by a damn chainsaw.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Just the sound of that, that thing cranks up.  Yeah, you know, it's not a clean wound.  No, no.  It's a ripping thing.  You know, the sharp, the chainsaw had been cut wood.  It's not sharp.  No, no.  Well, I'm looking forward to seeing it, because the first one, I guess, that was great.  You know what else is scary, though?  A cop, a man with a badge, who's psychotic.  That's what scares me.  A cop, because you, you know, as soon as you see him, you trust him. 
[01:18:00]  That's a cop.  You're going to save me.  But then to find out he's a fucking lunatic.  And he can do what he wants with impunity.  And he's bringing to his creepy son.  Yeah.  Now, it's like, oh, I'm fucked.  That was a good one.  My guy, the sheriff, is, I think Sheriff Hoyt is the second most favorite part that I've  ever done.  Really?  I really enjoy him.  You know, so many, I take every role that I do, and I've done 75 feature films, and every  role that I've ever done, every character, I always take it, push it to the limit.  I try to get it right up where it, he doesn't go over the edge, but he's right up to the 
[01:18:30]  limit.  Nothing aggravates me more than a director saying, take it down, bring it down a couple of notches,  and less is more, which we know is a crock of shit.  Less is not more.  I don't know who came up with that, but they're full of crap.  A guy with a small dick.  Yeah, I guess that.  The guy is sexually insecure.  There you go.  The guy you're stealing the scene from.  But this guy with the big one knows where to go, you know?  And the beautiful thing about Sheriff Hoyt is, God, he's a sexually perverted homicidal 
[01:19:00]  maniac.  There is no over the damn top with this guy, and they just let me go berserk, and I have  a great time doing him.  He's fine.  He's fine.  I'm looking forward to seeing it.  Can we ask about your ring?  Yeah, I'm looking at that diamond.  I can't take my eyes off.  That would be the mother of all Marine Corps rings.  Oh, yeah.  I went to the PA.  My old ring, I wore on my right hand.  That's my change pocket, and I wore the emblem off of it over the years, and about  10 years ago, my wife asked me what I'd like for Father's Day, and I said, well, I pretty 
[01:19:30]  much need a new ring.  We looked all over the PXs, and they were the common, usual, not-so-cool rings, and so  I sat down, and I made a couple of sketches and gave her a pat on the butt and sent her  off to the jewelry store, and she had this guy make this thing.  It turned out a little bit larger than what I had in mind in my paper.  I told you what I'm not, though.  It's the Super Bowl ring of the Marine Corps.  Yeah. 
[01:20:00]  For you, you're bigger than life, so you ought to have a big ring.  But if you're secure in your masculinity, a man can wear jewelry, you know.  That's true.  How many carats?  I don't want to have a dime.  That's four carats.  Oh, wow.  Jesus.  Get the jewelers loop out of your eye, Rich.  It wasn't born being four carats.  It was actually, when it originally was made, it was a half carat, and then every year, every  Father's Day thereafter, my wife would take it and take it down to the jewelry store and  kick it up a notch, you know, and I do the same for her, so it was an investment, basically. 
[01:20:30]  Over 10 years, it's evolved into a four carat diamond from a half a carat.  Do you have kids?  Do you have kids?  Well, you could call them kids.  They're old kids.  They're all over 20 years.  Imagine him being your dad, though, having to wake up you late for school in the morning.  I don't want to go.  Get your fucking...  You just fucked up, boy.  It's worse than Great Santini.  Like it's yesterday.  Yeah. 
[01:21:00]  Great Santini done it so much better than I did, though.  You know, I was kind of a failure when it come to being a father, simply because I was  just gone all the time.  And so I would come home.  I would be home for a few days, just long enough to get him squared away, get the baggy  pants off the boy, and get the skateboard away from him.  And the next thing, you know, I'd be on the airplane going away.  I'd come home, and the wife would have taken him shopping by then, and he had all brand-new  baggy pants, you know?  Yeah, she was a pushover, and I was the disciplinarian, but the problem was the disciplinarian was always 
[01:21:30]  gone.  Yeah.  So what are you going to do?  Did you make him cut his hair?  Did he have to have a short haircut?  They were pretty neat up until probably when they were 16, 17 years old, and the hair is  growing.  My son has a lot of hair right now, and I point that out to him occasionally, that he  has too much hair.  It doesn't seem like you're very happy about it. 
[01:22:00]  But so be it.  You know, it doesn't do anything.  He obviously doesn't have enough respect for me to go cut his hair.  So one of these days, I'll have to come home with a couple of big guys, take him down,  and just cut the dog shit out of me.  Butcher his ass, you know?  Well, teach him a lesson.  Yeah.  I hear you.  I'm sure that will work.  It was great.  Wow.  He'll love me forever.  Yeah, don't hold back, man.  Percent.  You can speak freely.  Did you hate, I mean, after you were done doing stand-up, were you glad? 
[01:22:30]  I mean, compared to acting, did you just hate the world around stand-up?  More money.  Yeah.  A lot more money.  That's the only difference.  I love doing stand-up.  It's fun.  And it's instant recognition, gratification.  Yeah, rich.  What was better?  A chuckle hut or a full metal jacket?  No, no.  Well, you know what?  No, no, no.  Well, the thing is, the movies go on and on and on, you know, and like full metal jacket,  you know, we did that 20 years ago.  I know.  It's amazing.  And it still goes strong today. 
[01:23:00]  There's not a day goes by what I don't sign a number of copies of full metal.  I did a thing for the troops called full metal comedy.  Right.  I went over there.  You just compared yourself.  Are you insane?  Compare yourself to a legend, you fucking blimp.  How dare you?  Go puke in the back of you, jackass.  Put your fucking, put your midget hand down.  Don't point at me with that finger.  You use your elbow if you're going to point at me.  No discipline in here.  The concept is real up to you here.  Yeah.  See what your opinion is.  Now, we've done two Texas Chainsaw Massacres. 
[01:23:30]  Probably are.  Chances are we will do a sequel to the prequel.  And I was thinking, you know, last, right in the middle of the last show, I was starting  to dribble and droodle and write and think about ideas.  I think a huge, tremendously successful show would be a spoof on Texas Chainsaw Massacre.  And I was thinking about, I would name it.  It would be a musical, comedy, musical.  And it would be, I would call it New York Hacksaw Manicure. 
[01:24:00]  You know?  Don't you, could you just imagine?  All right, who's going to do it?  I'll do it.  You can imagine Jerichoite and Leatherface up there dancing around like a couple of fairies.  You know?  What happened?  Bang!  Start up the...  Why don't you yell at him, boss?  You angry little Jew?  Come on, yell at him.  First of all.  He just said something about a manicure.  So maybe he made the right decision with acting.  But here's the thing. 
[01:24:30]  He could take that ring and put a dent in my head if he wanted to.  And he should.  And he should.  The other day, a fly.  I was watching news in the hotel room and there was a damn fly.  And it landed on my head.  And not even thinking, I hit that fly and it nearly knocked me out.  I saw a Starge for about a minute after that.  Oh, shit.  But this ring is at least a weapon.  I have to be very careful with it, you know?  Goddamn.  Well...  My point was with that thing is that back then you say now comics, actors, comics make 
[01:25:00]  more money now.  Because if you go, actors are actually turning into comics.  Dane Cook makes more money now.  You know how much money he'd make doing stand-up?  He could fill a club.  I mean, he'd make $30,000 a night.  But it's only the few.  You know, it's only the few.  It's the Eddie Murphys and the Whoopi Goldbergs.  And it's like, you know, only a few of the comics really do make the big bucks.  All the rest of them are stuck on Saturday Night Live making $150 a week. 
[01:25:30]  No, that's my point.  Back in the old days, there was no money.  I got paid $100 of stand-up when I was doing stand-up.  And what do you make, Rich?  Where was that?  Well, that's good.  $100 to stand-up?  Who are you talking to?  I'm Rich Voss from Last Comic Standing.  Do you know Rich Voss from Last Comic Standing?  From Last Comic Standing or Tough Crowd with Colin Quinn?  Yes, I watch.  Do you know him from it?  No.  Seriously, if you recognize, just walking the street, me or him, who do you think you would  recognize more?  Me or...  I wouldn't recognize either one of them. 
[01:26:00]  Good answer.  Thank God.  And I'm so glad Norton isn't here.  I'm so glad Jimmy Norton isn't here.  Because it would upset me if you did recognize Jimmy.  And Jimmy is a big fan.  The tough part is, you know, there's a lot of actors that are singing.  You know, they're going to singing.  Of course, if you have a hit record, you make money.  But you can sing all damn day and not have a hit record, and you're not going to make  beans, you know?  It's like writing that book.  You first of all have to make back the $35,000 advance they gave you before you make a penny. 
[01:26:30]  Well, I wrote a book about three years ago, and the advance is all I saw.  That was it?  That was it, you know?  And it's a good book, and they sold a bunch of copies.  But you just, it's got to be Harry Potter, you know, in order to make money.  What was it about?  Called Mail, Called the Book.  And it was, I took a bunch of the old scripts, and I hate to waste my time.  And I'm sitting on the airplane five hours going from L.A. to New York, and from New York 
[01:27:00]  to L.A. and Seattle and Washington, D.C., and I'm wasting my time.  So I got all the old scripts from Mail, Call, and I went back, and all the research was  done already.  So I went back, and I just did a book.  It'll be easy.  I wrote a book, and changed everything, of course, as far as dialogue and the way it  works.  But pictures, put some pictures in there, and I wrote a book, and they've sold thousands  of copies.  I know I've done book signings, and I've sold at least 10,000 copies of the book. 
[01:27:30]  Oh, you didn't see anything with the advance?  No, I haven't seen the dime.  I haven't seen the dime.  You've got to sell a million.  You need a biography.  And the biggest problem is with these actors that are going into, like, stand-up, for instance.  Okay?  It should be the other way around, because from stand-up, you go into acting, and there's  where the big bucks is.  You know, unless you are the main guy on the ticket, you don't make any money.  You know, you get the audience warmed up.  You know as well as I do.  You've been there, did that. 
[01:28:00]  Yeah, I've been there.  You know, you go and warm up the audience for Eddie Murphy, and what do you get?  You get 250 bucks, 300 bucks.  And the fat chick.  Yeah, and the fat chick.  That's it.  But the fat drunk chick.  You should definitely write a book, a biography.  Yeah, a biography.  You're in Vietnam, you said, right?  Well, I'm going to write a biography, but I'm not done yet.  God.  Yeah, I know, right?  He's not done.  I'm still young.  I want to wait until I get old.  Don't you want to have the money?  Then I want to sit around and write a book, you know? 
[01:28:30]  Yeah.  Can I ask you a question?  I want to wait.  Actually, I want to wait until my dad dies, because I have a lot of really filthy, nasty  things to say about him, and I don't want to have to do it while he's still alive.  Oh, yeah.  I'm just kidding.  He's worried about his dad, not his wife or his kids.  You can tell one story for us.  You've got to have something.  No, you know, my dad had me totally convinced when I was a kid that I thought my name was  stupid, you know, until I went in the Marine Corps, and they pointed out the fact that my 
[01:29:00]  first name was Ronald, my middle name was Lee, and last name was Army.  I thought it was just stupid.  Oh, no, really?  Yeah, he had all of us totally, I mean, you know, you don't call yourself, hey, idiot,  come here.  Well, that's my father, okay, in his drunken stupor.  So it was like, that's what I put up with, and that's what I was convinced by the time  I got in the Marine Corps, that I was a total loser, a total idiot.  And thank God for my three drill instructors, they pulled me out of that ditch, cleaned me 
[01:29:30]  off, and hosed me down, and put me in the right direction, and convinced me that there  wasn't much in this world that I couldn't accomplish if I set my mind to it.  Is that what drove you into the Corps?  Like, your father?  Oh, I was in the Marine Corps the day I was 17, I was on the bus, man.  Wow.  I was getting the hell out of Dodge, yeah.  I grew up on a farm in Kansas, a little farm, and my dad was an alcoholic tyrant, and he  had six boys. 
[01:30:00]  That might have a little something to do with why he was an alcoholic tyrant, you know, six  boys.  Ooh, can you imagine?  One year apart.  They, I guess, mom and he didn't figure out what caused that, you know, until it was  way too late.  Six kids later, they figured out how that happened.  So, and on the farm, back in the early 50s, we didn't have electricity.  So, well, hell, when it got dark, you went to bed.  Well, what do you do when you go to bed?  You make babies, right?  So, you've got to have some entertainment. 
[01:30:30]  That's what you were doing.  You didn't have TV back in those days.  It's just screwing is all you had to do.  That's it.  Just go screw your brains out.  Let's go to bed.  Come on, baby.  Let's go to bed.  Make another baby.  Yeah.  My first wife was, oh, Jesus, again?  Didn't we just do this last week?  Excuse me.  We have television.  But are you abnormally oversexed?  Geez, baby.  Do you talk to your father now?  My dad's okay.  He and I can't be in the same room for much more than 10 or 15 minutes. 
[01:31:00]  He and I believe we're differently politically.  We're different.  He is one of these Democrats that is totally 100% a Democrat.  And I don't have a problem with that.  But what I do have a problem with is why are you a Democrat?  I ask him.  You can ask him who is the president of the United States.  He can't tell you.  He don't know who the vice president is.  He voted for the Democrat on the ticket. 
[01:31:30]  He can't tell you what that guy's name was.  And he can't tell you what he believed in or what he stood for.  All he knows is that back in the 50s, the Democrats were union men, and he's the union man.  And the reason he got decent pay when he worked for the railroad was because they went on strike, and the Democrats backed him up.  The unions, and as far as he's concerned, he goes into the voting booth.  He and his wife, and his wife is instructed, and she's a yes lady. 
[01:32:00]  And they go in, and they punch everything with a D beside it.  They will not listen to, if they see something, a political person on TV that might be talking about,  I'm running for president, and I would like to have your vote, and this is what I stand for.  Blink, he changes the channel.  He didn't want anything to do with that.  How old a gentleman is he now?  He's 82, and he's not a gentleman.  Don't make that mistake.  Okay.  I was being respectful.  I'm an ass.  No sense in being respectful. 
[01:32:30]  Well, he's okay, but he and I get along fine now because I can kick his ass.  But it was a hard time growing up, and I was number two.  I had an older brother, and then I was number two, and number two is always the guy that sucks high and tit, you know, eats the shit.  I was the guy that, it was always my fault, you know.  Did you ever have that moment with your father where you finally crossed over, like you've been in the Corps for a while,  and you came, did you visit and then show him, like, listen, motherfucker, I'm back. 
[01:33:00]  No, I had to beat him at arm wrestling.  Was that it?  Yeah, that was the only way I got the upper hand.  I was picturing some big dramatic scene of you taking your hat off and, come on, hit me.  Yeah, when I pinned him, and then I looked him straight in the eyes and said,  and now you have some kind of an idea about what I might be able to do to you if you fuck with me anymore, you cocksucker.  Oh, wow.  She's uncomfortable.  But he looks swayed.  But he came around.  Dad's not a bad guy.  I get along okay with Dad now, but we have an understanding. 
[01:33:30]  You know, I have my beliefs.  He has his beliefs.  I grew up in a Democratic family, but I'm an independent.  Yeah.  I don't really agree with everything that the Republicans do,  and I certainly don't agree with what the Democrats do.  But, you know, I'm one of those guys that I've remained independent so that I can look at the individual,  and I make up my mind, you know, by listening to what his ideas are.  And I want to vote for the guy that's going to do the best thing he can for this country. 
[01:34:00]  What's pissed me off here lately is the Democrats and the Republicans.  It seems to me like they've evolved into a situation where they vote for what's good for the party,  not what's good for you and I or America.  And that bugs me.  Very good.  Thank you so much.  It's been a pleasure to have you.  Guys, thanks for having me on board.  It's been a pleasure being here.  Simply bye.  Y'all have a great rest of the day, okay?  Hoorah!  This is the worst of Opie and Anthony. 
[01:34:30]  Sirius XM.  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Red, white, and boom!  Here's your host, Iraq War hero, Robert Kelly.  Hey, it's Robert Kelly, and I'm hosting Opie and Anthony's Red, White, and Boo, our horrible  attempt at saluting those who have served their country proudly.  In this segment, we discover some of the old recordings of a DJ during the Vietnam War.  Hello, Vietnam! 
[01:35:00]  That guy?  No.  In this segment, we discover some old recordings of a DJ during the Vietnam War, who turned  out being a former U.S. airman who were broadcasting illegally from a makeshift studio in the back  of a whorehouse.  This is the legend of David Rabbit.  This is the worst of the Opie and Anthony show on Sirius XM.  Speaking of Vietnam, I brought in a bit of audio today. 
[01:35:30]  Spuds Buckley in the Numb?  No.  Didn't me and you fly a blimp over Hanoi?  No.  And bomb?  No?  I thought we did something like that.  Well, we started a bit, I don't know, over a month ago now, old school Opie and Anthony.  Basically, because I'm finally unloading boxes and boxes of stuff, and today I bring to the  show a radio show from 1970. 
[01:36:00]  I remember that was the year we first got together.  In Vietnam.  Old school Opie and Anthony doesn't mean it's all just our stuff.  Oh.  It's just stuff I've had in boxes for a very, very long time, and I found this.  And, wow, it's Dave Rabbit.  This guy, like E-Rock was doing some research on this guy.  I had no idea.  I've had this tape, actually, my good friend Stork.  Yes.  Stork from Huntington.  He turned me on to this guy, Dave Rabbit. 
[01:36:30]  And we've had this tape for years, years.  I've had this tape probably for like 20 years at this point.  And I gave it to E-Rock.  It's on a cassette, another one of these cassettes.  And E-Rock went through it and did some research.  And I guess he's a hero on the Internet, right?  Yeah.  There's been this big thing surrounding him.  They never knew who the actual guy was up until a couple of years ago when the guy finally  came out and said, you know, this was me.  That was me.  And there's been clips of his broadcasts circulated through the military for years. 
[01:37:00]  And nobody knew who he was.  He has merchandise and everything that he made by hand back in 1970 where he was just drawing  on old...  Wait, out of ears and teeth?  No kidding.  He would have some kind of paint and he would just draw on these old sweatshirts and have  Vietnamese kids selling them on the street for like two or three bucks.  Wow.  And these things are big collector's items.  And now he's residing in Dallas, Texas. 
[01:37:30]  How old is he?  He's got to be 40.  Late 50s.  That's it?  Yeah.  Well, this tape is what?  37 to 38 years...  No, he's got to be...  Late 50s.  1970.  Well, maybe.  Is 37 years ago.  So he could have been 20?  Okay, I suppose so.  The youngsters were going to Vietnam, so...  I think he's like 59.  All right.  That's about right.  All right.  Let's call him right around 60.  And what's...  This isn't good morning Vietnam stuff, by the way, because Jimmy asked me before the 
[01:38:00]  show.  No.  This is not high energy.  This is a guy that is smoking a lot of weed or dropping something, because he talks about  acid a lot.  Some of the dope.  And he's just doing a show for the guys in the field, and these guys are listening on  their little transistor radios, wondering if they're going to survive the day.  Yeah.  Oh, is that him?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Why does he got to wear camo if he's on the radio?  I don't know.  So his name's Dave Rabbit, and, you know...  He's going on a mission, I tell you, because we were all in camouflage when we bombed that  TV station, Opie. 
[01:38:30]  Well, we had to take out the communications.  Yes, we did.  Yes.  Wait.  What did you yell at those people again?  I don't remember.  You didn't remember?  No, I don't remember.  I really...  I don't remember.  Anyway, continuing the old-school Opie and Anthony bit we started a while ago, I present  you with Dave Rabbit today from 1970, 1971.  Just a taste here.  We've got a bunch of clips.  How did nobody know who he was?  Were these pictures new? 
[01:39:00]  Were they always out, or no?  No, the pictures only came out a couple years ago.  He actually released a letter to a couple of press organizations.  You know, stating the history behind the tapes, who he was, etc.  Everything but his real name.  Yeah, I need to know more about this guy.  So, here we go.  Dave brings the truth, and hard, acid, rock.  Listen to this.  Good evening again, ladies and gentlemen.  This is your host for the next three hours of hard, acid, rock music.  Dave Rabbit. 
[01:39:30]  For those of you who have just recently come into the Republic of Vietnam, I'd like to give  you a little information about it, so your mind won't be quite so blown when you hear  such words as f***ing, and words of that nature.  We're an underground radio station here, and we say what we feel like saying, and we bring  the truth to the first-termers in the Republic of Vietnam.  We also bring you hard, acid, rock music, all through the night. 
[01:40:00]  The up-to-date music of today's American youth.  I like this guy, man.  How cool is that?  That's not good, buddy, Vietnam!  This is the real deal, man.  That's history.  How crazy is that?  I like that stuff.  Guys, he sounds like he has a cool voice, like Rod Serling, and he just sounds high.  Yeah.  Oh, he's probably so goddamn high. 
[01:40:30]  Yeah.  Underground, does that mean he ran it, or he was renting space?  How does that work?  You know what?  I didn't know anything about this guy.  Iraq is actually helping me out.  He tried to get a job on the Armed Force Radio Network.  He was interning there.  Which is the Good Morning Vietnam type of guy.  Oh, right, right.  They wouldn't let him go on the air.  They wouldn't let him touch any of the equipment, so he just hung around and watched how they  did everything.  Through some creative trading, he got some equipment and was renting a room in the back  of a whorehouse in Vietnam, and they tiled the studio with these one-inch tiles and mattresses 
[01:41:00]  to kind of deaden the sound so you wouldn't hear all the sex going on around the while  they were broadcasting.  So it's him and two other servicemen are doing their show in the back room and just transmitting.  First, they started illegally.  They were tapping over the Armed Force Radio Network signal before their time check and  everything at 8 o'clock at 7.59.  They were saying, Armed Force is opening up a second channel, flip to 69 on your FM dial 
[01:41:30]  there, and listen to radio first-termer.  And then at 8 o'clock, the signal would hit and the radio network would kick in.  So then everybody flipped over to 69 and started listening to this for like a year and a half.  Did you intern for them, Ira?  Because I know you made the rounds, a lot of radio stations.  No?  No.  Why did you, this is, what's his name?  David Rabbit.  I like the garlic butter saw.  Garlic butter saw here in country.  Isn't that a great story, though?  It was underground radio, man.  He was like telling the real truth of what was going on, you know, in the field. 
[01:42:00]  This is your first time in the Republic of Vietnam.  Try the garlic butter saw.  And the acid.  Yeah.  You want to hear a little more?  Yeah, man.  It's pretty cool.  All right, this is Dave Rabbit.  A message from the latrine walls.  He used to do a bit, he did bits, simple bits, but it was called A Message from the Latrine  Walls.  Give me the information.  During the night, we're going to be reading some of the things off the latrine walls around  the Republic of Vietnam.  No.  While I'm home, my wife is my right hand. 
[01:42:30]  While I'm away, my right hand is my wife.  Cooking from the big 69.  From the who.  The who.  Yeah.  How cool is that?  As you just blast in a .50 cal over a trench.  Right. 
[01:43:00]  Oh.  Oh, yeah.  Wonderful.  Yeah, I think they were trying to find this guy, too.  He was getting way too popular.  They didn't want, uh...  They didn't...  That was pretty dirty for the day, huh?  Yeah.  Well, there was no FCC, right?  You're in the middle of nowhere.  Oh, of course not.  You want one more before the break?  I want many more.  I love this guy.  This guy's got a great delivery.  Yeah, he's more cool.  I want to start doing that.  More Dave Rabbit.  Yeah, let's just all talk as much like him.  Like Dave Rabbit.  Pinball Wizard by The Who.  I've had quite a few letters recently concerning some of the different items that Radio First 
[01:43:30]  Termor has to offer his followers.  And one of the biggest things is the official Dave Rabbit sweatshirt.  For those of you who are unaware of what a Dave Rabbit sweatshirt is, I'll tell you.  It's a white sweatshirt.  On the front of it, it has a large white rabbit.  And the rabbit's **** is completely ****. 
[01:44:00]  The rabbit is carrying a sign.  On the sign, it reads **** it before it **** you.  If you'd like one of these Dave Rabbit sweatshirts, send a postcard along with 298.  298.  A Dave Rabbit sweatshirt.  Radio Saigon, underground, APO in country, 96969. 
[01:44:30]  Cream.  Cream.  And the hits just keep on coming.  How cool is that?  He's my favorite radio person ever.  Yeah, that guy's delivery's great.  The material's great.  I've had this tape for over 20 years, man.  Finally found it in a box.  Let me ask you a question, though.  With this guy, if he's giving out an address and stuff like that, and he's got letters,  how could he do that?  If the government wanted him gone, they would have traced him.  So how did that happen? 
[01:45:00]  From what I understand, a lot of that stuff, they really, the government was having a hard  time because it would go to fake businesses or just farm people.  Like, here's the address, and then there'd just be a farmhouse there.  And they would just drop the mail off at these places, and somebody would eventually come  around and pick it up.  Oh, okay.  The guy was just a tech geek that figured out how to freaking do a radio show in the middle  of Vietnam.  You're listening to the worst of the O.P.  Anthony Show.  On Sirius of Sirius XM.  Well, let's go right back to the tape. 
[01:45:30]  It's Dave Rabbit, 1970, 1971.  And he talks about taking a bathroom break here.  Listen to this.  Cream with White Room.  Oh, he was a chatty Cathy, by the way, because he was talking after every song, I noticed.  Oh, boy, would the PD have a field day with this guy.  He was talking well into the song, too.  Oh, I know.  Over the vocals.  He didn't give a crap.  That's why I love this guy.  Breaking all the rules.  Yeah.  Cream with White Room. 
[01:46:00]  White.  We're going to let this next one roll on through.  Why?  Well, for one reason, I'm going to go take a big, heavy, heavy, boring, unforeseen incidences  that may occur during my trip to the latrine, such as being picked up from marijuana or stopping  in and getting a quick f**k with one of the whores down the hall, I'll be back to finish 
[01:46:30]  this goddamn program.  I love this guy.  I love this guy.  I love this guy.  Hilarious.  He got away with more in Vietnam in 1971 than we do now.  Yeah.  But Howard was the first, you know.  Of course.  Of course you were, Howard.  It's because of shock jock.  Ignore all the people that came before you.  That's great.  Way to know the biz.  Wow. 
[01:47:00]  How great is that?  Like we explained during the last break, the guy was broadcasting a show from the back  of a whorehouse.  So hence the, you know.  Yeah, getting a beep from one of the whores.  What did he want to get?  A cup of flour?  Yeah.  Yeah, you know.  Hello.  Bar some sugar, please.  Yeah.  Could you put it in your beep?  Let's go to, never mind.  Let's go to Wes, the trucker.  Wes.  Good morning, brother boy.  Hey, man.  Hey, I'll make it quick. 
[01:47:30]  Tell me this guy doesn't sound like Space Shuttle Endeavor.  Yeah, a little bit, a little bit.  Endeavor.  A lot of people saying he sounds like Chris Hansen.  Yeah.  Rod Serling.  Who else?  There's a couple others that came in.  Damone?  Damone.  No, it's all about Rod Serling.  Come on.  Let's hear more of this guy.  All right, here we go.  That's all I want to hear.  Well.  Let's cancel Louis Black and cancel Terry O'Quinn and listen to him.  I will play more tomorrow.  Because tomorrow, I'm saving the good stuff for tomorrow where he's tripping on the air. 
[01:48:00]  Completely tripping on the air and openly admitting it because he has no bosses.  I'd love to know who was able to trip in Vietnam.  Wow.  Yeah, well.  That would be a creepy trip.  I hear it was very popular.  Oh, well, of course.  Tom just came down the hall and told me I can't mention that because they're not advertising.  This doesn't, it doesn't make good radio to trip on the air.  No.  That's right.  Are you kidding me?  Someone is tripping on the air and I'm listening every day.  Of course.  Every day. 
[01:48:30]  Here's, well, we get to meet Captain Ivan Pansy.  And he does the weather for Dave Rabbit.  I haven't listened to this tape, by the way, in easily 10 years.  Time for another weather report on the 22nd attachment of the 30th weather squadron with Captain Ivan Pansy.  Oh, my doll.  All right, Captain, you're on the air.  Darling.  My darling Clemence.  Oh.  Thank you, Dave, and good evening, everyone. 
[01:49:00]  This is your midnight cowboy, Captain Ivan Pansy, with tonight's weather.  Stop it, Ralph.  Tonight's weather is kind of screwed up, mainly because I've been kind of hopped up on goofballs  and haven't made a report of yet.  Anyway, we'll give it a go and see how badly I can screw it up tonight.  Today's high was 146 degrees in the shade.  Don't know what it was in the sun.  Wasn't stupid enough to go out in it. 
[01:49:30]  Well, tonight's low took it down to 69 degrees.  Hey, 69.  It sounds like a well-rounded number.  But the sun will rise at 0645 hours for you lifers and 645 a.m. for your first thermos.  It will shed at 1945 hours for the maggots and 745 p.m. for the first thermos.  Well, Dave, that's about the way it looks on the weather scene for tonight.  This is your midnight cowboy for the Saigon, the Trang, Phan Rang area, Captain Ivan Pansy. 
[01:50:00]  Wishing you all a good...  I mean, excuse me, a good evening.  Now, Ralph, now stop it.  Now, how many times have I told you to stop it?  Thank you, Captain Pansy and Ralph.  And Ralph.  And Ralph.  Thank you, Captain Pansy and Ralph.  Captain Pansy rules.  They were just having a good old time.  He's not JFK, Captain Pansy.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I think that's what he was going for. 
[01:50:30]  He's doing little bits and characters.  They got a cast.  A cast of characters.  And this was done in 1970?  Yeah, you know.  Don't even friggin' tell me who invented what.  Jesus.  Ah, it's always been out there, to be honest with you.  Great stuff.  You got to respect the people that came before you.  I want Captain Pansy.  And acknowledge that they did some stuff before you did.  What?  I want Captain Pansy to do the weather here every day.  Yeah.  Steve.  No, that's General. 
[01:51:00]  He's been promoted.  He sure has.  I've gotten a promotion.  General Fruit.  I'm a four-star Pansy.  Let's go.  He got new stripes on his knee pads.  I get gold clusters, but they turned out to be warts.  Let's go to Jason in Carolina.  Jason.  Hey, boys.  Hey.  I wondered if Dave Rabbit ever cruised around Vietnam in a blimp. 
[01:51:30]  All right.  All right.  That's not nice.  That's right.  We're going to drop these bras on you, mother-huggers.  Yeah.  The F-U-A-B-U.  I hate you.  Just in case you're wondering.  Oh, my God.  There's your answer, Jimmy.  Nick in Cleveland, what's up?  Good morning to you.  Hey, ONA.  What's going on?  What's up, Nick?  Hey.  I just want to tell you guys, first time listening to you live in Cleveland, and I'm glad you  guys are back, man.  Thank you, sir.  We've got something specifically to hear you.  Yeah.  I'm sorry. 
[01:52:00]  I just want to tell Jimmy that we're coming to see him, House of Blues, second show, dude.  I can't wait to see you, man.  Thank you very much, man.  Both of those shows are sold out, so I appreciate it.  House of Blues.  House of Blues.  Nice.  We're very excited about being live in Cleveland.  I can't stress that enough, man.  It's been way too long, because, I mean, we've been on tape delay in afternoons, but  we haven't been able to talk to the people in Cleveland for a while.  I've been able to communicate, have the people contribute, call in.  It's nice.  It really is.  We've always had a very good rapport with our Cleveland fans. 
[01:52:30]  Yeah, it's a sick city.  Thank you, sir.  Let's go to Kevin in Connecticut.  Kevin, what's up?  Hi, guys.  Hey.  I hate to bother you at work.  Yeah.  Can we find this stuff online somewhere?  It's got beeps in it on the radio.  Did you just say, I hate to bother you at work?  Well, first of all, I do have the...  That's a very funny line to tell a radio show.  Yeah.  I do have the uncensored stuff that we're going to play a little bit later on.  A little later, huh?  And I'm starting to learn that I got gold in my hand here. 
[01:53:00]  I don't know if I want to just throw it on the internet.  Maybe it's time to make a buck or two.  Jeez.  No, I'll throw it out there.  We'll figure it out.  Maybe throw a couple clips on onaradio.com later today, because I think Stephen S.  wants it for the rundown.  Thanks, guys.  All right.  And then we'll put the whole thing that I got.  I only got one show.  I mean, one show.  I got about 30 clips.  That's about it.  Huh?  Good stuff.  Yeah, I think it's great.  Let's go back to it, matter of fact.  See how many lost breaks there are, how many lost air checks, and just things that no 
[01:53:30]  one ever recorded?  Yeah.  Absolutely.  Just for my dopey radio career, I'm like, why wasn't I taping?  Well, you think you feel bad.  You know some of the original Tonight shows?  The dummies at NBC wanted to save money on tape, so they just started taping years ago  over some of the original Carsons.  There are no copies in existence.  So dumb.  Just audio.  Oh, there's audio?  Wow.  Why didn't the people that came before us realize that maybe somebody wants to listen  to this crap someday? 
[01:54:00]  Eventually.  Because then they do that with the Honeymooners, too?  There's a few that they just don't have tapes of or something like that, or they got very  strange versions of it.  Try some of the originals.  Maybe from the Jackie Gleason show.  Maybe, yeah.  And they were doing sketches.  All right.  Let's get back to Dave Rabbit, 1970, 71, Underground Radio from Vietnam.  Oh, yeah, this one's good.  Another message from the latrine walls.  His bit.  Cactus, you can't judge a book by looking at his cover. 
[01:54:30]  Here's another quickie from the latrines in the Republic of Vietnam.  This guy writes, fighting for someone else's freedom is like f***ing for someone else's virginity.  Yeah, you can't judge a book by looking at the beach.  F***ing power.  Bye.  What did he say?  Hold on.  I'll show you.  Something power? 
[01:55:00]  Oh, you're writing it down.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, well, of course.  Yeah.  Basically, he said power.  Yeah.  But use the T word for that.  After I remove the ice pack, I use a deep pore cleanser lotion.  In the shower, I use a water-activated gel cleanser, then a honey almond body scrub, and  on the face, an exfoliating gel scrub.  What is that?  Patrick Bateman.  Dave has a complaint right here. 
[01:55:30]  This f***ing f***er is so goddamn long, I could have gone downstairs and got a shot  of back.  What is that?  And you laughed.  A shot of back?  What is that?  It sounds like he could have gotten one of the whores.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I was wondering if it was a drug reference.  I've never heard shot of back before.  I didn't know what that was.  Could be a drink over there.  Back could be some kind of Vietnamese, like, you know, corn liquor or something. 
[01:56:00]  Who knows?  Yeah.  I don't know.  I instantly thought it was sexual.  Yeah.  Well, it might be.  He was complaining because the song was way too long.  Because, you know, this guy liked to talk.  Oh, this was in the middle of the song?  The song was still going.  It was like six minutes in, and then he just comes on and says how annoyed he is.  That's crazy.  I love this.  You sure this guy isn't related to me?  He just seems annoyed at everything.  This f***er is so goddamn long, I could have gone downstairs. 
[01:56:30]  They've got a shot of back.  A shot of back.  Rattling on, but more music.  Iron butterfly.  Fly.  Full experience.  Speed kills.  Slow down.  Smoke grass.  Smoke grass.  I love this. 
[01:57:00]  Just babbling into the mic.  And don't ruin it for me and show me a current day picture of this guy.  I just want him.  Oh, I got an image.  Really?  He's hardcore.  You think?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  If anything happened, he could pick up a rifle and take care of business.  He's living in the woods somewhere.  Yeah.  I saw him already.  And?  No, huh?  Oh, boy.  Don't ruin it for me.  I won't.  Dr. Steve.  I won't.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  I'm not going to ruin it for you.  He looks like anyone's father. 
[01:57:30]  Dr. Steve.  Oh, boy.  Dr. Steve looks like an intellectual.  Yeah, he is.  He's a doctor.  Yes.  They're known to be bright.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  It looks like he graduated high school.  Well, are you ready for the next one?  Yes.  Yeah.  Iron butterfly.  Soul experience.  Lifers are like flies.  They both eat s*** and bother people.  Wow.  Thank you. 
[01:58:00]  So subtle, man.  That's a great delivery.  They both eat blank and bother people.  Wow.  I haven't bothered people.  I have hilarious lifers.  That is good.  Lifers.  Lifers.  Butterfly.  Soul experience.  Lifers are like flies.  They both eat s*** and bother people.  And bother people.  Thank you, Pete.  Did you hear that?  What was that?  Pete in the background going, right on. 
[01:58:30]  Thank you, Pete.  Do you like Huey Lewis and the News?  This is off of sports.  All right.  You know what?  We got to play a couple more.  Of course we do.

Uh, no.  Let me hear it.  Let me see if I can figure it out.  I don't know it.  Okay.  I'm not going to look at the board.  Mama Told Me Not To...  You have to play it again.  I can't I didn't

He just  He only broadcasts for a certain amount of hours a day  So I guess when he does the news  It's pretty much towards the end of his broadcast  And then he just flips the switch  And his signal goes dead  Wow  Sounds like he did it yesterday  It sounds  It's more modern than what the shit we have to listen to now  Well, yeah  That's great  Then you got Howard saying he invented this whole thing 
[02:07:30]  Obviously this shit was being done a long time ago  You gotta acknowledge the people that came before you, man  Holy crap  This guy was an original  Yeah  I wonder if he ever had a real radio career  After he got back from the war  And see a lot of them  Yeah, I don't know  Maybe he went by another name  And was kind of doing more legit shit  I don't know  No, who would know is  Get stupid Abrams on the phone  Oh my god  Here's Dave Rabbit's philosophy  And he does theater listings

Mike, so  They think we know  Because it comes out  Of the radio  But I heard it  No, I heard it on the radio  Oh, then it must be true  No, we said it  Here's another saying  From the latrine walls  If you're sitting down  Taking a crap  And reading this  You're probably  The only motherfucker  In the republic of Vietnam

They sound like  They were having  A great time  Just hanging  Just hanging out  In whorehouses  Doing H  Listening to Hendrix 
[02:13:00]  That's not a bad life  Right there  He had some kind  Of connection  Where he would reveal  Where officers  Were maybe  Dining out  For the evening  And any time  Yeah, any time  The MPs  Were going to set  Like a drug bust  Or a surprise inspection  They'd get the information  And start broadcasting  Right away  Right as the MPs  Are heading to  Wherever the troops are  Wow  Alright, we got another clip  What, warn the troops?

Oh, man  Holy shit  Called in by General Creighton  Was he in the service?  This guy? 
[02:14:00]  Yeah  I mean, was he just  Did he just show up?  He was in there for a year  And then was discharged  Or released  Because they screwed up  His paperwork  So he was labeled  As something called  A 1-H  Which he asked what was  And they said  It's classified  We can't tell you  So he did a year  And then was released  But decided to hang around  And do this radio station  Oh, really?  Yeah  That's amazing  Oh, so he was in Army  When this was happening?  No, he had already  Served his time  Oh, cool  I bet you  I wonder if he's afraid  Of saying who he really is 
[02:14:30]  Because he's afraid  That his Army pension  Or something  Will be affected  His military pension  Yeah  Here's another quickie  From the latrine walls  In the Republic of Vietnam  This joker writes  18 days  Until I can go home  To picket and protest  This fucking weight  Of human lives  That lifers  And the government  Call a war  Haas Cartwright

[02:15:30]  Memorial Day special  More coming up  Continuing on with  Vietnam DJ David Rabbit  We actually tracked him down  And got him on the phone  To talk about his  Infamous broadcasts  Sometimes my mouth  Gets too wet  To do these things  And at the end  I don't know  How his voice feels  I have fucking heartburn  It's the worst  Of the Opie and Anthony show  Dave  Yeah  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show  How are you, sir?  Hey, brothers  What's happening? 
[02:16:00]  Well, we've been having  A lot of fun  Playing some clips  From your underground radio show  From 1970  Saigon  Vietnam  I love it, brother  I love it, yeah  And I gotta tell you  I started radio in college  And I was in a fraternity  And this guy Stork  And this guy, I think  Joe also had it  Or I think we might have  Got it from Joe  Had this tape of you  Doing First Termer  The first  It was called First Termer, right?  Yeah, Radio First Termer 
[02:16:30]  Uh-huh  And we were amazed  By this cassette  And no one knew  Anything about you  No one knew anything  About the show  And we would listen to it  Every once in a while  And then I got a copy of it  And I just threw it in a box  And I don't know  15, 20 years go by  And all of a sudden  I'm unloading my apartment  And I find this thing  And I'm like  Oh my God  I used to love this tape  And I brought it on  Into the show  And we've been playing it  And just freaking out about it  Yeah, E-Rock sent me  A copy of the show yesterday  I wasn't available 
[02:17:00]  To listen to it  But yeah  You guys rock and roll, brother  You really do  Well, you had quite the show  Back then  I mean  What was it?  Were you a pirate station?  Were you taking over a signal?  How did it actually work?  Well, I mean  Reader's Digest version  It actually started  When I was on my second tour  In FanRang  I was associated with  A legal AFVN radio station  Called Radio FanRang  And my roommate 
[02:17:30]  Jim Brookshire  Is the one that got me involved  As his studio engineer  And as it turned out  When I left that assignment  To go to Saigon  We had a rocket attack  That morning  That I was leaving  To go back home  On R&R  And a rocket landed  In our room  Killed Jim  Wow  And, you know  If I had been laying there  I'd been dead too  So it really rocked me  To my roots  Because this was just  A generous, sweet, loving guy 
[02:18:00]  That would have, you know  Done anything for anybody  In humanity  And it was a senseless war  To begin with  And the fact that he was taken  Angered me tremendously  So when we got to Saigon  My mission was to do something  That AFVN was never going to do  Or Stars and Stripes  And that was to bring  Rock and roll  To the troops on the front lines  And I'm talking  The Army Marines  The guys that were  Every day  Lugging through the  You know  All the swamp  And the forest 
[02:18:30]  And the trees  And all that  And that's what we did  And, you know  It took us two months  In pre-production  Just to get everything together  To where we could even  Get on air  So you decided  You couldn't go on  To a regular radio station  How did you decide  Where to broadcast from  And this was done  Basically from a whorehouse, right?  Yeah  I mean  Pete Sadler  Not his real name  Was a frequent flyer  At Madam Hoes  And so anyway  He says 
[02:19:00]  I said  We need a place  And we couldn't do it  On the base, obviously  I mean  That was a little bit  A little no-brainer  So he says  Well, yeah  Let's go down to  Madam Hoes  And I said  Okay, sure  And we met Madam Ho  And offered her  Gave her one of those  Vito Corleone things  You know  An offer she couldn't refuse  Basically was  She got to keep the mattresses  And all the equipment  When we got through  Kind of barter situation, you know  Well, they set up the studio by  I should just jump in real fast  They set up the studio  By lining the room 
[02:19:30]  With mattresses and stuff  To keep out the outside noises  Keep out the moanings  That is going on down the hall  There was a lot of that too, brother  Yeah  Man  So you set up in this whorehouse  And how long did you have  Do you actually do the show for?  We lasted 21 days  Mainly because  We didn't want to go to Long Den  Which was a prison in Vietnam  They were really after us  The base commander  I don't know whether you played  That little snippet yet 
[02:20:00]  But the base commander  Was not a big fan  Of Radio First  Term or Dave Rabbit  He made it a vow  To find me  And, you know  Toss my rabbit buttocks  Into the prison system  And I guess, you know  There was something  About the prison life  That just didn't appeal to me  So even though  We had military police  And officers  And lifers  That were actually  Protecting us  You know  We had to shut it down  It was just no way  We could have  Continued on 
[02:20:30]  More than 21 days  And so we demolished everything  You know  We gave the equipment  To Madame Ho  And then we got rid of everything  Burned everything  Where there was no trace  That connected us to the show  And we walked out the back door  Of Madame Ho's house  And, you know  And never looked back  Yeah, you were saying  Some ballsy stuff  For back then  And for being in the military  Especially  And broadcasting  To the military  I'm sure they didn't really enjoy 
[02:21:00]  Some of the stuff  You were saying  About the lifers  And the brass  And whatnot  Well, you know  I mean  The officers  I mean  There was  There's always a percentage  Of them  That couldn't take a joke  As well as the lifers  But you would be  Real surprised  How many huge fans  We had  That were in the officer ranks  As well as the  Top military ranks  Of the  You know  The regular stripers  So you did this radio show  For three weeks  And were you surprised 
[02:21:30]  That the tapes  Had gone out  All over the world  I'll tell you  What really blew me away  I mean  As I say  We walked out  On the 21st of January  Of 71  And never looked back  In the summer of 1982  I'm at a party  Here in Dallas  And I'm talking to this guy  And we're just  You know  Shooting the breeze  And it turns out  He was in the army  In Germany  We spot in Germany  And he said  Well, what did you do?  I said  I was in Vietnam  He said  Hey, did you ever hear  Of Dave Rabbit? 
[02:22:00]  I said  Yeah  And he goes  Well, man  He says  That guy really ruled  Did you listen to him live?  I said  Yeah, I really did  And then one thing  Led to another  And I said  Well, you're not going  To believe this  But I'm Dave Rabbit  And he goes  Nah, you're not Dave Rabbit  And so I did  You know  I remembered  A couple of events  You know  About the  Toothpick in the toilet  And the crabs  Pole vaulting  And so I kind of  I kind of did  And he says  Oh my God 
[02:22:30]  And he  I mean  He actually hits the floor  And starts bowing down to me  And I'm going  What is all this about?  He says  Man  He says  You're a legend in Germany  I'm going  How am I a legend in Germany?  Because I'm thinking  You know  The last show we did  Was the 21st of January  71  This is 82  How can I be a legend in Germany?  And then  That's when I found out  That somebody recorded  One of the shows  And I have a good idea  That it was the  Radio relay guys  That were  Bumping our signal  Throughout Cambodia 
[02:23:00]  Laos  And the  Southeast states  All illegally  By the way  That took balls  On their part  Yeah  Yeah  And so  And that's when I first found out  That a show existed  And in  You know  February 9th  2006  I get on the internet  The kids want to know  Stuff about  Vietnam  And I'm  You know  Googling  Which I never do  I hate to Google  Well  Occasionally on Friday nights  I like Googling  But only if I have a bar  So  Anyway  So what happens is  Is that 
[02:23:30]  I get on the internet  And I find this  This site that says  Audio clips from Vietnam  And I'm thinking  Okay cool  And I see when it says  Radio First Term  Well I click on it  Then I find  Will Snyder's site  Who created the original  Dave Rabbit home  And get on that  And see  That he has these clips  And then I start Googling  And find  AboveTopSecret.com  Which is my family  Right now  That I have  With the ATS Mix show  And then one thing  Leads to another  And it's just been 
[02:24:00]  A crazy  Crazy ride  It really has  Yeah  Because  I mean  When I found out  You only did 21 shows  That amazed me  Obviously the people  That taped these things  Thought it was so unusual  And so different  And so cool  That they obviously  Wanted to trade them  And give them to other people  And then that's where  This whole thing grew  Because no one gets popular  From doing 21 radio shows  No one  Well  I did  No no  I understand that  But  That means live  Like it's all 
[02:24:30]  Dave  That was actually  A compliment  Like no one  Just does 21 shows  And that's it  I mean  You obviously  Had something  You were basically  You basically  Had the voice  Of the soldiers  That's why  They can relate to you  And that's why  This thing  Becomes a phenomenon  Because they're like  Wow  You gotta hear this tape  We all remember  When we were a lot younger  If we heard something  Really cool  You could say  Turkey Boys or whatever  You wanted to pass  This tape on to others  And that's how  This whole thing  Ended up just becoming huge 
[02:25:00]  Yeah  And it's one of those things  To where you know  You get something  And you pass it on  To a buddy  And that kind of thing  And that's really  How it grew  I mean  I mean  Conservatively  We have 23 million  Military and civilian fans  Worldwide right now  I mean  Strictly from  You know  Them finding the internet  They finding the  The stuff on the websites  And stuff  And  And strictly  Passing it on  To somebody  That gives you  A great idea  Of how grassroof  Movements  Can really be 
[02:25:30]  Very effective  Right  What did you do  When you came back  From Vietnam  What happened  With your life  Did you do radio  Did you pursue it at all  No  And here's the weird thing  I came back home  My family had a business  Here in Dallas  My dad and mom  Were not of the best health  And so I took that over  And kind of put  My radio career  On hold  And then  When I  Got involved  With Above  Top Secret  Dot com  And my  My partners  Simon Gray  Mark Allen  Steven Melzer  Bill Irwin  And of course  My partner  Johnny Anonymous  We started this 
[02:26:00]  The ATS Mix show  About eight months ago  And started doing a podcast  And then  You know  One thing led to another  And the show  Got real popular  And we got  Huge fan base  Going  And now  As I told  EROC  Yesterday  We're on the verge  Of going  Nationwide  Syndication  In the next  Three or four months  So it's a pretty  Amazing ride  37 years later  But  Yeah  So you walk away  From radio  37 years ago  Which obviously  You had the passion  To do it  That had to kill you  And you only got 
[02:26:30]  Back into it  Eight months ago  Well actually  Yeah  I started  Yeah  We started the show  Eight months ago  Right  And you didn't do  Any radio in between  For the most part  No  Oh my god  That's amazing  What kind of work  Did you do  Well I  You know  I don't want to  Tell too much  About that  Because everybody  Will be going  On the doors  I sold my business  Actually  Last May  And decided  To do this  Full time  And that's kind of  I took a leap  Of faith  I figured  You know  If I'm going  To do this  At 59  Boys 
[02:27:00]  I know you  Were using  Your calculator  Trying to figure  Out how old  I am  Yeah  But at 59  I figured  You know  If I'm going  To do it  I've got to  Go do it  Now  So I sold  My business  And really  Turned my back  But basically  To answer your  Question  It was just  A business  That was in  Marketing  I was in  Marketing  In a general  Degree  Have you had  Your  Have you kept  Your identity  Private for all  These years  About who  Dave Rabbit's real name  Oh yeah  In fact  When I went  To above  Topsecret.com  Originally  When I googled 
[02:27:30]  It and I thought  What the heck  Is above  Topsecret.com  And I click  And this guy  By the name  Of John Jeremiah  And his post  Is still there  On the site  He thinks  I'm a conspiracy  Theory  Of the government  And that the  United States  Government  Put me in  Saigon  To you know  For some kind  Of war effort  Kind of thing  And I'm thinking  This is nuts  This is crazy  And from that  You know  A love affair  Began between  Me and  Above  Topsecret.com  Because I lovingly 
[02:28:00]  Call it Disneyland  For nuts  But boy  It's just so much  More than that  You know  Yeah  It looked like  You guys  Were having  A great time  Why would you  Why do you  Keep it  Why do you  Not want to  Reveal who you are  Well  One reason is  That you know  My wife Bunny  And my son Jack  And Peter  And of course  Babs and Bugs  You know  It's amazing  How many people  You know  Will see me  On the street  And they don't  Have a clue  Who I am  See I like  Going in my life  In stealth mode 
[02:28:30]  I kind of like  I kind of like  That I don't know  Who you really are  Well you know  I mean  That's the  That's the mystique  About it  If everybody knew  You know  That you know  I'm really  You know  George Stephanopoulos  With ABC radio  I mean that would  Really blow the whole thing  You know  I mean they just  Didn't identify with that  It's actually  Rush Limbaugh's  Alter ego  I love that  So you're doing the show  Every night  With your pals  And stuff  And every day  You're thinking  This is going to be  The last show  There's no way  I can keep this going  Right  Oh well 
[02:29:00]  You know  Every day was  A gamble  I mean it really was  Because I mean  They were trying to find us  With triangulations  And all kinds of stuff  And it was really impossible  For them to do it  Because of the radio relay guys  I mean  We were on  Three hours only  You know  During that window  Of opportunity  So I mean  They tried  I mean they tried  Real hard  But here's why  We stopped  The military police  The OSI  Office of Special Investigation  In the military  These guys  A lot of them 
[02:29:30]  Were our friends  They knew about us  They were encouraging  The show  To  You know  Get on the air  So when they got  To a point  Where their supervisors  Were saying  Look  There's no reason  In the world  That you're not  Finding these guys  Unless you're  Implicated with them  And they started  Getting a lot of pressure  And I'll never forget  It as long as I live  A very good friend  Of mine  In the OSI office  Comes up to me  And says  Dave you gotta stop  He says  Because if you don't  We're all gonna go down  And I said 
[02:30:00]  Okay that's it  And that's when we stopped  So they protected you  For as long as they could  Until it was obvious  They were protecting you  Wow that's an amazing story  And you come back  And you live your life  You go 37 years  And you start up again  And did you know  That there were so many  Recordings of your show  Floating around  Like different shows  Or did you only have  One copy yourself  Well you know  We found a reel-to-reel  That was some trooper  Found in his  It's kind of like  Opie found in his  Little box and stuff  This guy had a reel-to-reel  He had an old T-act 
[02:30:30]  And we basically  Paid him money  To transfer it  Into a digital format  And the ones  That we have right now  On the Dave Rabbit site  The pod site  Which is  DaveRabbit.podomatic.com  Has the  The remastered version  Of the entire show  And plus we've got  You know  The Iraq show  Which I did  As a 35th anniversary  With a new team  But yeah  We've got  There's over 500 bits  Of Dave Rabbit stuff  On that site 
[02:31:00]  Because I can't put  Everything on above  Topsecret.com  Because we're G-rated  Yeah right  We're a family site  I can't put a lot  Of the Dave Rabbit  Material there  But you know  Those guys that  Really like that  Kind of stuff  There's a ton of it  On the DaveRabbit.podomatic.com  What are you doing now  As far as your podcast  What kind of show  You're doing  Well you know  It's about  What we are  Which is our  Ecosystem that  That was created  By the genius  Simon Gray  Who was the founder  Of above  Topsecret.com  We lovingly call them 
[02:31:30]  The three amigos  And basically  It's about  Alternative subjects  Such as  Conspiracy theories  9-11 conspiracy theories  UFOs  Aliens  I mean  Just anything  That you can imagine  That would be  A topic of  Conspiracy or whatever  Would be  What we're talking about  I mean they have  Weaponry resources  And uploads  Really above  Topsecret  Secret societies  It's just a  Smorgasbord  If you will  Of every 
[02:32:00]  Alternative  Topic you can  Possibly think of  Is it kind of like  I'm sorry to interrupt Dave  Is it kind of like  A coast to coast  Like Art Bell  Type subject  No  And I'll tell you why  Because  In my respects  To George  And Art Bell  And those guys  Over at coast to coast  But what we do  Is we take  The same subjects  But instead of  Being there like  Two squirrels  Going 69  Which is exciting  For a few minutes  And then it kind of  Loses this appeal  We put levity 
[02:32:30]  And humor  And put  A lot more  At ease  With our guests  And we just have  A good time  We rock and roll  When we get with  Our people  We rock  We give them  A little taste  Of Dave Rabbit  But on a  FCC compliant  Basis  If you know  What I mean  Very nice  Well Dave  We definitely  Have to take  A break here  This was a pleasure  Though  Great talking to you  Yeah absolutely  I have to tell you guys  You guys were an inspiration  We just donated  $25,000  To the Girl Scout  Organization  For their new drive

[02:33:30]  Yes amazing  That's what I'm saying  And it lasted that long  Yeah  Cool story  Absolutely  Why don't we go back in time  Dave Rabbit  Vietnam 1970  Doing the underground radio show  That we just discussed  For the last few minutes  Good evening  This is Air Force Sergeant  Dave Rabbit  And this is Nugent  With tonight's news  In Washington today  President Nixon  Was officially charged  In connection with  The Maile Massacre  Although the president  Was nowhere near Vietnam  At the time  Higher ranking officials  Are positive 
[02:34:00]  That there is some connection  What however  They aren't sure of  No comment from the president  Was available  Nugent  In Alabama  Governor George Wallace  Is announced  As his running mate  For the presidential election  As H. Rapp Brown  Rapp was not available  For comment  But his associates  Say it was the happiest  Day of his life  A blissful event  Has occurred for  Tiny Tim and his wife  19 year old  Miss Vicki  They have announced  The coming birth  Of their first child  When asked about  The nervous tension  And stress  Of having a first child  Tiny Tim stated 
[02:34:30]  That he's sure  He'll have no problem  Giving birth  The first time  He also stated  That the baby  Will be breastfed  Miss Vicki also said  That Tiny will have  To have his chest shaved  So the baby  Won't gag on the hairs  Finally in the news  Lyndon Johnson  Was arrested  In his Texas home  For indecent public exposure  After he led a group  Of Vietnam protesters  Down Main Street  Johnson was also cited  On ten counts  Of public vulgarity  And one count  For shooting the finger  At an Air Force officer  Preliminary hearing dates  Have not been set yet 
[02:35:00]  And that's the news  This is Air Force Sergeant  Dave Rabbit  And Nugent  Wishing you a very good evening  The voice of news  Information  And hard acid rock music  This is Radio First Term  At 69 megacycles  On your FM dial  Wow  Those are little pieces  Of history  It's pretty cool  You know  Absolutely  Hearing what was going on  Back then  Them goofing on it  Anthony from Boston  Do you think  Good Morning Vietnam's  Robin Williams  Is based on Dave Rabbit  Absolutely not  No Adrian Cronauer  I believe  Yeah he was  Around the same time 
[02:35:30]  Obviously  But Dave Rabbit  Was doing his own thing  Very different actually  Because Robin Williams  The character he played  Was high energy  This guy was all about  Just kind of  Sounding or  Being stoned  I've had a few requests  For some pictures  Of myself  So some of you people  Wanted to hang some  On your walls  Or in the latrines  Or something  But to tell you  The honest to god truth  I have really no  Pictures of myself  That can be made 
[02:36:00]  Into posters  However I do have  One picture that  Some of you might want  It's a picture of  Myself  And my ex-girlfriend  Going  In her bathtub  Now if you'd like a copy  Of this  Which is blown up  By the way  Into an 8x10 glossy  Colored photograph  Just drop me a card  To Dave Rabbit  Pornophic  Picture  Poster  APON  9-6-9-6-9-6-9-6-9  And I'll try to get 
[02:36:30]  One to you  More music now  Donovan  Hurdy  Gertie  Man  Hurdy  Gertie  Man  He was making up  All this crap  Because who would  Want a picture of him  He only broadcasts  For three weeks  You know  Although he's probably  Getting a lot of letters  I mean he had  20 something million  That guy would make  An impact  Pretty quickly  With the soldiers  I think  Mouthing off like that  About stuff  Like cornball radio  They were used to  Yeah yeah 
[02:37:00]  And then him  He's just dropping  F-bombs  Taking a dump  Screwing his  Girl  And the whores  And  Good stuff  In answering  Some of your questions  As what the base commander  Thinks of me  Here are his exact words  If I ever meet  That son of a bitch  I'm going to walk up  And I'm going to hit  That  Right square  In a god damn T  More than one  Would you believe  That's what the base commander  Thinks of me  In my nasty ways  Tsk  Tsk  Tsk  F*** 
[02:37:30]  You  Sir  First I emphasize  The word sir  He has an inferiority complex  I mean after all  Anybody that dresses up  In women's dresses  And carries a velvet purse  Has to be a little bit weird  What a set man  No kidding  And finally the last clip  The show ending  This was the last show  Right here  Yeah  This is the ending  Of that show  Of this particular show  Well unfortunately  It's that time again 
[02:38:00]  For  To go and pee  To myself  We've just about  Reached the ending  Of another radio  First trailer  For the night  And we'd like to leave you  With a few closing thoughts  First off  Remember  There is no black power  Or white power  Or white power  In Vietnam  Born to be wild  There's only one power  And that's rabbit power  And that's rabbit power 
[02:38:30]  Another thought  When you go downtown  Wish you were taking  Enough rubbers along  In case you want to go for  Two or three or four or five  Or six or seven  Like Pete does  Well Pete  I've enjoyed it  It's been another fantastic night  Of cutting the air force  To pieces  And saying nasty things  On the air  And hopefully  If we're not  Floating jail  By tomorrow night  We'll be able  To come back again  At eight o'clock  And blow your mind  With more hard acid music  So  On behalf of myself 
[02:39:00]  And for  Good old Pete  We'd like to say  Good night to each other  Pete let's say  Good night to each other  Good night Pete  Good night Gary  Sounds professional  Doesn't it?  Huh?  Be tuning in again  Tomorrow night  Please  Don't whack off  Listen to all the old  First camera instead  It's more filling  Okay Pete  We haven't tried  To these folks  This is our new ending 
[02:39:30]  Alright  Let's say  Good night Vietnam  Right?  Alright wait a second  Okay folks  This is going to be  One of the real big things  Are you ready for this?  Wait a minute  Don't click count me up Pete  One  Two  Three  Good night Vietnam  It's Memorial Day  And you're listening to  Red White and Boo  Here's your host 
[02:40:00]  A guy who actually  Gained weight in Iraq  Robert Kelly  Hey it's Robert Kelly  Hosting  The Opie and Anthony  Red White and Boo  Our horrible attempt  At saluting  Those who have served  Our country proudly  In this segment  We speak to  Former  Right now  E-Rock and Troy  Are fucking pissed off  That it took me so long  To get this shit right  Troy's energy  Is that of a soul  Sucking cunt  From Conan the Barbarian  The first one  With Arnold Schwarzenegger  Remember those bitches? 
[02:40:30]  E-Rock is just  Looking at me proudly  Knowing that he's got  A bunch of fuck ups  He can fuck me with  On the air  Someday  If I ever piss him off  I'll never call you fat again  Eric  In this segment though  We speak to  Former Secretary of Defense  Donald Rumsfeld  Who called in to promote his book  But comedian Louis C.K.  Was in studio too  And he asked him  What could be  The most important  Political question  In the history  Of the United States  You want to know  What that question was?  Well don't turn that button 
[02:41:00]  Isn't that what it is now?  It's a button  Nobody has dials  It's the worst  Of the Opie and Anthony show  We gotta go right to the phone  Oh my god  Turn that music down  And welcome  Donald Rumsfeld  To the Opie and Anthony show  Sir  Hello sir  Yes indeed  How are you?  Very good  Very good  What a pleasure to talk to you  Donald Rumsfeld's new book  Known and Unknown  A Memoir  I've been looking through this 
[02:41:30]  Fascinating stuff  Because  Boy you have been  A part of history  In this country  For many years  Known many presidents  Welcome to the show  Mr. Rumsfeld  Well thank you  It's a little embarrassing  To discover that I've lived  One third of the history  Of our country  One third  The history  And been involved  In a lot of  A lot of things  That have gone on  Through history  Indeed  Important  I want to mention  I want to mention  That all the proceeds  That I receive  From the book  Are going to go  To the troops 
[02:42:00]  And their families  I thought what you  Were going to mention  Was you know  Exactly where we live  And to be nice  Oh we  Opie  It's not  Where are you right now  Are you just at home  No I'm in New York City  Oh okay  Last night I was on  The Jon Stewart show  Right  There was a  How did that go  Because Jon is a little  Liberal  I would say  Well he  Comes at things  From that direction  But he is very smart  Very good  And it was a good discussion 
[02:42:30]  I was pleased to be there  Yeah  Have you ever been interviewed  Where you got upset  With how it went  And then actually did anything  To exact revenge  On the person  Never  Why would he do that  I don't know  That's Louis C.K.  Because you  It's interesting though  Because there are people  Who think  I mean here's a guy  Who were you know  Met Eisenhower  As a congressman  Right  I was running for congress  Exactly  And you know  Worked for Ford  And Nixon  And Reagan  And both Bushes 
[02:43:00]  And there's still  Those people out there  That think you know  Rumsfeld  And Dick Cheney  Are actually lizards  Who  I mean literally  There's people that think  They're lizards  From outer space  Yeah that's true  Who eat human flesh  I don't know if anybody's  Ever asked you directly sir  But are you  Are you a lizard  I don't think  Are you  Actually  Can you just please  Give that a straight answer  Are you  A lizard person  Louis  A little left leaning  No I'm not  I'm not 
[02:43:30]  Let him answer  Are you a lizard  Here's the short answer  I'm in New York City  I walk down the street  People walk up  Shake hands  Stop me  They want an autograph  He's a lizard  I want to get a photograph  With me  Go to eat last night  At dinner  And Joyce and I  Were sitting there  In the little Italian restaurant  And a man came up  He might be a lizard  I'd like to buy my dinner  And it turns out  I paid for my dinner  The next thing I know  The waiter comes back  And said the man  Insisted to pay for your dinner  And here's your  Canceled receipt for me  Oh wow 
[02:44:00]  That's very nice  See there's plenty of people  That  You didn't answer the question  He's not going to  Dignify  I think you're hanging around  With the wrong people  He's not going to  Dignify an answer  To are you a lizard  Louis  Why not  Because he's not  A lizard  What is the story  About getting somebody  Paid for your dinner  I would pay for a lizard's dinner  I think I understood  The fact that there are  People out there  That appreciate what he's done  As a leader  There is plenty of evidence  That this guy is a  Well decorated  And appreciated American  And he has more credibility 
[02:44:30]  Than almost anybody  Exactly  But I just want to know  If he's a lizard  He's not a lizard  Stop it  I want to apologize  Mr. Rumsfeld  Louis C.K.  Is a stand-up comedian  And I do not share  His ideology  One iota  Matter of fact  We're meeting him  For the first time  We don't even really know  Yes  So we apologize  Exactly  It's usually just me and Anthony  Exactly  But we said  What the hell  We'll try out this local comment  Mr. Rumsfeld  I want to ask you a little bit  About the situation  That's going on now  In the Middle East  You are an envoy  To the Middle East  What do you see happening there  What's your take  On the whole situation 
[02:45:00]  Well I think what's happening  Is that  We had good relations  With many of the governments  In there  In that region  And it was contributing  To a stable situation  With respect to the  Generally hostile attitude  Towards Israel  Because an important country  Like Egypt  Had a peace treaty  With Israel  And that was a valuable thing  That Sadat did  And Mubarak stuck with  The problem is  That those countries  Did not move  Towards freer political systems 
[02:45:30]  And freer economic systems  As rapidly as they should have  And the people  Are looking for opportunities  Very large populations  That are young  And they don't have jobs  And they don't see opportunities  And they look around the world  On television  Or Facebook or something  And they see other countries  Where people are doing well  And they become dissatisfied  So you have these kinds of  Turmoil  And popular revolutions  Now the problem is  That take Lebanon 
[02:46:00]  For example  There was a popular revolution  Yeah the Hamas  Hezbollah ended up  Taking over  And a terrorist organization  And repressive  Right  The same thing in Iran  Now isn't that a worry  Like especially when you have  A revolution  As they did in Egypt  Not a revolution  But you know  Whatever you want to call it  The guy's gone  Without having another guy  To put in there  Isn't there a worry 
[02:46:30]  As America  As to who's going to be there  And what kind of government  Is going to be in place  Absolutely  Everyone ought to be concerned  Not just our country  But Europe and Israel  And the neighboring countries  If the problem is  That you can have a popular  Greater protest and revolution  And the winner  Is not the people  That are looking for  Greater opportunity  The winner often is  The most  A minority group  That is very disciplined 
[02:47:00]  Very well organized  And very vicious  Like Hezbollah in Lebanon  And or like the Ayatollahs in Iran  Yeah  So you could get  The Muslim Brotherhood  Oh that doesn't sound good  The radical extremists  Exactly  Over Egypt  Which would be terribly dangerous  Absolutely  And these are great questions  Anthony  And they're questions  That Mr. Rumsfeld  Is going to answer better  Than almost anybody  In the world  Yeah  But I still want to know  If he's a lizard  And if he's  Stop it  If he's tasted human flesh 
[02:47:30]  No stop  I just want to know  Mr. Rumsfeld again  I want to apologize  For Louis C.K.  He's a stand-up comedian  He's playing at the Borgata  Go to Borgata.com  Look if he's a lizard  Who has eaten people  Don't encourage him  It'll just make him worse  See and I will stop  Mr. Rumsfeld  The second I get a denial  I'll stop asking  Tell Louis that my grandchildren  Are listening  See  Well listen  They have a right to know too  No he's not a lizard 
[02:48:00]  And he's not tasted human flesh  But here  He's answering  That's easy for you to say  I can answer  Because I know  The guy is a great American  A great patriot  I totally agree with that  He's done great things  For this country  And  Yes Anthony  Is he a lizard  Is Dick Cheney a lizard  No they're not  They are people  Have they eaten any Mexican babies  Have they eaten any human beings  No  Stop it  Stop it  I know  Mr. Rumsfeld  I apologize  Louis C.K.  I paid for this microphone  Mister  He's trying to be funny  I don't understand it 
[02:48:30]  Where do you see the  Why don't you let him answer  Where do you see the 2012 elections going  Do you see the Republicans taking the White House again  And who do you see as maybe a good front runner for the Republicans  You know I don't think there is one  I think it's one of those rare times when there's not an incumbent president running  And there's not a vice president running  And there's not an obvious person  And I think what we ought to do is watch them run around the track a while  And see how they handle things  It's a tough job  As President Obama is finding out 
[02:49:00]  It's a lot easier to campaign  Exactly  And so I think we ought to watch all these candidates  There's some terrific ones running  And I think some of them have executive experience  Some of them have a lot of legislative experience  And see how they handle  Because what's going to happen is  They're going to get asked tough questions  They're going to get put in difficult positions  And we're going to then be able to see how their brains work  How they react  How they handle things  What kind of people they recruit for their campaign team  How effective they are in organizing 
[02:49:30]  And all of those are attributes that are helpful for a president  Before the Lizard Council meets  And decides who to appoint  The Lizard Council doesn't appoint a president  And he's not part of the Lizard Council  If they do, don't you want to know  Don't you at least want to give them a chance to say  No, I'm not a lizard  I don't want to picture Donald Rumsfeld on the other end of this phone  Nobody does  I'm not listening to you asking Lizard questions  With red lizard eyes  No, he's not  Mr. Rumsfeld  Again, with the 2012 elections 
[02:50:00]  Wouldn't it be good to  And I always wonder why this doesn't happen sooner  To start really grooming a good candidate now  They always seem  The Republicans always seem to wait  Till the last minute  To really kind of get together  And get a candidate there  A viable candidate that could take on a Democrat  Especially an incumbent  Well, I think that's true of both political parties  If you think back to the Democratic primary  That Mr. Obama won 
[02:50:30]  And I think the reason for that is  There's no senior council of leading Democrats  Or leading Republicans  Who can go into a smoke-filled room  And start grooming somebody  It's the American people and the parties  The people of each party  That end up picking these candidates  But it does seem like it would be a lot  A lot more advantageous  Especially for the party  If they would kind of work together  Instead of everybody trying to get their piece of the presidency 
[02:51:00]  To just work together  And get a candidate  A viable candidate to run  That would really have a shot at winning  Well, and of course  A primary process can produce a mistake  And you could end up with a candidate  Who's not very good  Exactly  And I don't think we want to see that  I definitely don't want to see another four years  Of Barack Obama  No, I know  That's for sure  Incumbents, you know  Often get re-elected  And I think the Republicans  Are going to have to be careful 
[02:51:30]  Not to overreach  And to manage their affairs  In a way that are responsible  And yet address what the American people really care about  And my goodness  This administration has served up a number of targets  How anyone can think that the budget  President Obama put forward is responsible  Is beyond me  Yeah  The debt in this country is crushing  And it's going to damage this generation  And future generations  Unless people have the courage to step up and deal with it  What was it like when you met 
[02:52:00]  There's a picture of you shaking hands with Saddam Hussein  Like, what was that day like?  The day you met that dude  Oh, that famous picture  The dude who later was hung in a badly lit room  I tried to tell Louis that that was indeed  During the time when he was an ally  I'm just curious what that day was like  And was...  Okay  I'm just curious  What was that like to meet that fellow?  Fair enough  Well, it was...  I was in Baghdad at the request of President Reagan  And I kind of described this in my book  I met the night before with Tariq Assis 
[02:52:30]  The deputy prime minister  And then the next morning  I was invited in to be with Saddam Hussein  And the reason that Secretary Schultz  And President Reagan and I all agreed  That it made sense was  Saddam Hussein was in a war with Iran  And had taken our embassy people hostage  And was very hostile to the United States  The United States did not have  Diplomatic relations with Iraq  And the thought was that  You know the old adage  The enemy of my enemy is my friend 
[02:53:00]  Right  How did we manage to get crossways  With the two big countries in that region?  Both of them  And yet they were hostile to each other  Right  So we felt that it was a good idea  To see if we could reestablish relations  And that ultimately was done  Shortly after my visit  Now what was it like?  You walk in  There's a Middle Eastern despot  Is he a good guy or a Democrat?  No  He's a thug  And he's in his fatigues  And he's got a pistol on his hip  And he's a tough guy 
[02:53:30]  And not a good guy  On the other hand  People in Iran were worse  And when you get up in the morning  And look around the world  You know there are not a lot of  George Washingtons or Abraham Lincolns  We have to deal with people  Who aren't perfect on occasion  Exactly  That's what I was trying to tell Louie  And then  So how many guys do you think  You've met that died by hanging?  Oh Jesus  That's a good question  Yeah more than one  More than one  More than one  I've never met anybody who  I've met a girl who hung herself  But I've never met anybody 
[02:54:00]  Who was sentenced to hanging  He's had to deal with thugs  During his career at some point  Sure  He's you know  The world  And a lot of people judge things  I've noticed  Mr. Rumsfeld  A lot of people judge things  Based on what's going on now  They don't take it in the context  Of the history  And what was going on at the time  Now during the Cold War  I think we were willing  As Americans and the press  To accept a lot more  Covert action  On the part of the government  For our own safety 
[02:54:30]  Than we are now  Do you think that's a better thing  That there's so much more  Information available  Now  Or is it kind of a good thing  For the government  To have maybe a little bit of  A little more  Covertness in their actions  Oh I think you're right  I think that  We live in a world  Where there are relatively  Few countries  That are like we are  We have free political systems  And that means that  We have got to have  Intelligence gathering activities 
[02:55:00]  If we're going to protect  The American people  Exactly  But what like  American safety  Is like the biggest deal to us  American defense  We've got to keep  The American people safe  How many  But what if a whole lot  Of people in other places  Have to die  In order for us to be safe  Like what if you found out  That a lot of America  Was going to get hurt  Unless we just took France  And just wiped it out  Would you trade France  Hypothetical  Would you trade France  For Texas and Arizona  Can you imagine 
[02:55:30]  If I answered that  Thank you  But the news lead would be  Exactly  It would be like  Answering your earlier question  Where I would deny  That I'm something  That you asked me  Right  He's not going to deny  He's a lizard  But he hasn't officially denied it  What would be hurt  By denying that you're a lizard  I did not just arrive in town  Falling off a turnip  There are no turnip carts  In New York City  Well he didn't fall off of one  No I totally understand 
[02:56:00]  But no that's fascinating to me  What would be hurt  By denying  And I'm not going to ask you  To deny it now  I'm more interested  In what would be hurt  If you denied that you're a lizard  Justifying the question  Sorry I brought it up  I apologize  No  But I mean  We like to think  That we're a comedy show  So we're just kind of asking  A silly question  That is fascinating to me  That saying I am not a lizard  Might be dangerous  I want to know  How it might hurt  How would it hurt  Your credibility  How did this happen  How did this happen 
[02:56:30]  There's a guy laughing  In the background  That is looking up  Our addresses now  Mr. Rumsfeld  Notice that Anthony Cumia  Is  A true patriot  I am right behind you  I love your book  Donald Rumsfeld  Known and Unknown  Memoir  In bookstores now  This thing  Really flying off the shelves too  I want to ask Mr. Rumsfeld  His opinion on the unions  Right now  That's a big topic  Right  Out there  Yes  Well it is  And what we've got  Is a government  An administration  That according to the data 
[02:57:00]  Has fewer people  Who've ever been in business  Than any administration  In modern history  And what you've got  Is a lot of people  Who are lawyers  And professional government people  And they don't have  The business background  They have very close  Connections to the unions  And I'm terribly worried  About the way  That our trade relations  Are going around the country  We are  The president  And the administration  Have been responding  To pressure from the unions  With respect to the trade deal 
[02:57:30]  With South Korea  The trade agreement  With Colombia  Here's Colombia  An important country  In our hemisphere  And we've been  Stiffing them  And not  We're missing  What's going on  In the world  In Asia  There are all kinds  Of trade agreements  And the United States  Is absent without leave  We're not engaged  In doing it  And I think the answer  Is it's because of the unions  And we're at a first point  In our country's history  Where there are more union members  Who are government employees  Than there are  Who are in the private sector 
[02:58:00]  That's a conflict  If you ask me  Well it's a worry  Yeah  And I think it's also  Not surprising then  To note that the average pay  Of government employees  Is now higher than  In the private sector  That's not right  And of course  Why is that not right  Because it should  It should be the other way around  Well of course  Teachers are government employees  Right  And the jobs  And the products  And the opportunities  Are all in the private sector  Not in government  Right  But a teacher  Is a public employee 
[02:58:30]  Right  Is a unionized public employee  Yes  So they should be paid well  Right  But it's not a matter  Of being paid well  But they should have the power  To get together  And bargain for better pay  And better benefits  Right  Well if you look around  At the school systems  They are in trouble  And they're not providing  The kind of education  For kids  And so the system  Isn't working perfectly  My wife Joyce  Started the Chicago  Foundation for Education 
[02:59:00]  Because the Chicago  School system  Was described  As the worst school system  In America  Some years  25 years ago  Wow  And that's  Here's a great city  A wonderful city  And it had a school system  That the secretary of education  Labeled the worst  Now why is that  It isn't because  People are bad  It's because  The process isn't working  There wasn't any choice  People didn't have a choice  They paid their taxes  And they had to go to school  In their neighborhood  And they didn't have choice  I'm a Milton Friedman fan 
[02:59:30]  I think  Giving school vouchers  So that people can  Parents and kids  Can make those choices  And pretty soon  The schools that  Nobody wants to choose  Have to disappear  And the schools  Where people want to go  Succeed because  They get a good education  They prosper  Yeah but American  Public schools  Used to be great  And now they're not  So for years and years  They did well  Without vouchers  And charter schools  And then all of a sudden  Money got taken  Out of those systems  And now they're suffering  And then the people  That took the money out  Point at the system  And go  Ha ha you suck 
[03:00:00]  Because I took your money away  So now we're going to  So what happened  Why did they work before  I don't think that's the case  What you just said  I don't think that the  The reason the schools  Are not doing well today  Is because the money's not there  I think that you look  At the average price  That we're paying  Per student  Or per school  And it's quite high  It just isn't producing  The kind of results  That a more competitive  System would  How come it worked  Before though  When it was simpler  Public  Most people went  To public schools  And you could just 
[03:00:30]  Go walk down  To your public school  And get a great education  Like how come  There's a decline  When it was working  Without the competition  I think probably  It was a result  Of the fact  That we were  More of a rural country  We had much more  Parental involvement  There was more  Smaller elements  And then as we became  More of an urbanized  Country  There was more distance  Between parents  In the schools  More distance  Between government 
[03:01:00]  In the schools  And they just  Deteriorate  And teaching the basics  Of what people  Need to know  Instead of a lot  Of political  Correct gibberish  Really?  You think that's  In the schools now?  I believe that, Louis  Is teaching evolution  That's what hurt  The schools?  No, no, no  I'm not saying that  I just think that  There's a lot going on  In schools  That has nothing to do  With educating the students  And preparing them for life  I could be wrong  But I think there might  Have been one other thing  You know, for years  We had the draft  And we excluded people 
[03:01:30]  From the draft  Who were students  Teachers  Or married  And as a result  People who did not  Want to serve in the military  Kind of gravitated  To getting married  Or becoming a teacher  Or becoming a student  And so over time  You had a bifurcation  Of a generation  And that group  Is now just about retiring  Right  Because the all-volunteer military  Came in under the 
[03:02:00]  Nixon administration  In the late 1960s  And early 1970s  And so all of those people  That were up to 1970  Now, of course, would be  30, 40 years later  So if they became teachers  In the ages of 20, 25, 30  They'd now be retiring  Did he answer the question  About unions?  Are you for or against  The unions, sir?  What do you mean?  I've got no problem  With unions  What I have a problem with  Is if unions end up  Exerting an undue influence 
[03:02:30]  In what's taking place  In our country  And stopping  The United States of America  From participating  In free trade agreements  Around the world  Which are the kinds of things  That help to create jobs  Yeah, that's not a good thing  But if the jobs  Are in other places  And what  I mean, if the United States  Is getting to compete  Who is the United States  At that point?  Is it General Electric  And, you know, Walmart?  Or is it actual people  Who live in these places  Like Wisconsin  Who are asking to be able 
[03:03:00]  To sue for their own rights  As a union?  Well, you know  I'm the governor up there  I'm not knowledgeable  About Wisconsin  I'm from New Mexico  As the cover of my book shows  No, you've got a  Polar fleece on  A handsome picture  But my recollection is  That the governor  Ran on a platform  Of doing exactly  What he's doing  Addressing the fact  That the state  Is bankrupt  And how does he fix that?  Well, he can't fix it  If the unions won't let him  And he's going to have to 
[03:03:30]  Find a way  To put that state  On an upward path  Rather than allowing it  Continue to go down  Spending more than they take in  Exactly  And if the unions  Are going to try to prevent that  He has to do something  About that  I got an observation  You sound just like  Dr. Demento  What?  Dr. Demento  Someone's going to  Appreciate that out there  The funny five  The guy used to do  The funny radio thing  Yes, you've got  The exact same voice  Well, he's got  A very distinctive voice  I know you could always  Tell Donald Rumsfeld 
[03:04:00]  When he was on TV  Right  Even from the other room  You have a very strong  Distinct voice  I have a couple of questions  Just out of curiosity  I want to ask you  It's just an observation  Mr. Rumsfeld  What type of aircraft  Did you fly?  I was flying  The last plane I flew  Was an S-2F  Which was a Grumman  Anti-submarine plane  Oh, that's cool  Did you have more capability  To fly it  Because of your lizard reflexes?  Stop it  I've got a thought for you  Okay, good  If you're looking for  A present for friends of yours 
[03:04:30]  I spent eight days  Recording the unabridged version  Of my book  About eight hours a day  And if you want to hear the voice  And the voice, right  What you do is  You buy the unabridged version  Of the book  And then you can play it  In your car  When you're going  To and from work  And I'll be right there with you  I think you need that, Louie  I'll be right there with you  You absolutely do  I want to ask you  One more thing  Because I know  You've got to go soon  I'm a very, very strong 
[03:05:00]  Advocate of the Second Amendment  I'm a lifetime member  Of the NRA  Are you a member  Of the NRA?  I'm not sure  If I am right now  I have been  And I think I am  And are you an avid shooter?  Because I am  And I love it  I have guns  I have rifles  And shotguns  And pistols  And various locations  And I'm an elk hunter  Out in New Mexico  So you're a strong advocate  Of the Second Amendment  As I am, sir?  Have you ever shot  Have you ever shot a person?  No  No 
[03:05:30]  That's a great question  I think everybody  Should be asked that  Have you ever shot some  He was the Secretary of Defense  He was in charge of everybody  That America killed  For a very long time  Oh, stop it  I've been shot at  Does that count?  He's been shot at  That's crazy  I was next to President Ford  When the bullet went right by his head  And right by my head  Into the hotel in San Francisco  Wow  Yeah  That was that  Have you ever shot at  With any other  Besides bullets  Like plasma rays  Or anything else  That are used 
[03:06:00]  Space  To take down  Would you stop it, Louis?  Flesh-eating space lizards  My God, man  Who eat the poor  Donald Rumsfeld  Known and Unknown  A Memoir  I suggest anybody  That's interested in  The history of this fine country  And the history of a patriot  And this fine man  Go out and buy this book  Thank you, Donald Rumsfeld  Thank you so much  Thank you  Enjoy being with you  I'm pretty sure you're a lizard  He's not a lizard  Stop it  Thank you, sir  Thank you, sir  He ate people once  You can select your partners carefully 
[03:06:30]  Yeah, I'm trying  I'm trying  Just a local comic, sir  That we really don't know much about  Yeah, I don't know  He'll be gone tomorrow  You're listening to the worst  Of Opie and Anthony  Red, white, and boo  Here's your host, Iraq War hero, Robert Kelly  Hey, it's Robert Kelly  And I'm hosting Opie and Anthony's Red, White, and Boo  Our horrible attempt at saluting those  Who have served their country proudly  In this segment, former governor of Minnesota 
[03:07:00]  And former Navy SEAL  And former good actor  And former good wrestler  Jesse Ventura  Jesse Ventura  Is in studio  This isn't Jesse's first visit to the show  But it turned out to be his last  As he got into a heated argument  With Jim Norton  A.K.A.  The Angry Thumb  And Jesse just walked out  Jesse was mad  So was Jim Norton 
[03:07:30]  I don't even know what that was  Fuck both of you  Fuck your judgment  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show  What have you proven about the Hells Angels?  I mean, come on  You're right, the Hells Angels  They're a motorcycle gang  They've done some bad stuff  But to actually mention them  In a discussion about  What they're trying to do  Well, what I'm saying to you  I'm making the comparison  Here you have an organization  That's involved in crime  Yes, mafia  Irish mafia  All of them  Sure, absolutely  And so  Should we treat them the same way?  Because certain  Sometimes people die around them 
[03:08:00]  For no reason  They kill people  You're going to tell me  That they've never killed anybody?  But they're not hijacking  Commercial airliners  And flying them into buildings  But they might  If it served their purpose  Wouldn't they?  I don't know  They might do it then  I don't know  Maybe they would  Maybe they would  What does that prove?  And if they did  Well, what it proves is  You have to treat everyone  The same under the law  You can't simply say  Okay, the law applies to you  But it doesn't apply to you  Because who plays that god figure 
[03:08:30]  That makes that decision?  Who do you allow  Hold on, Jesse  To be able to make that decision?  You're not wrong  But the decision of  The way the legal system is  You know how it is  The way the legal system  So you think that we should  Just allow these guys  Look, we saw what happened  With the Zacharias Moussaoui trial  It's a fucking circus  And so we're going to allow  These guys just to language  So you're saying that  They don't deserve a trial  Not saying that  That our government just says  You're guilty  No  And we're going to execute you  Or do what we do  No trial  You're putting words in my mouth  I'm not saying that  Well, I'm asking  No, I'm not saying that  Well, then when do you have a trial? 
[03:09:00]  When do you allow  When do you allow  Our rules of law  Is it only for our citizens?  It's hard to  Honestly, in this situation  I don't know  Because we've never faced  This type of an enemy before  Then why  This country has never faced this before  Why wouldn't you take POWs  From any war we've ever been in  And bring them over  And try each and every one  For murder of U.S. citizens  Because they represent a country  All right, we're in a different situation  These people don't represent a country 
[03:09:30]  Thank you  Bin Laden didn't he  Represented the Taliban  Wait, we're back to the Hells Angels  They don't represent a country  They're like a gang  Yes  They're a gang within the United States  They're American citizens  Well, what difference does that make?  The difference is  Our laws apply  You don't have to be a citizen  To have our laws  Otherwise  What would we do to tourists?  When we're at war with somebody  The rules are treated  Are different  You know that  The rules of engagement  Are different  For military  Yes 
[03:10:00]  You don't think Khalid Sheikh Mohammed  Should be held under military rules?  Boy, that is quite the loophole then  That people could not come over  He should be tried  He should be tried for murder  Because he killed  He's a civilian who killed civilians  He should be tried the same way Manson was  Al-Qaeda is operating as a military operator  It's a different enemy  I mean, the U.S. has never seen an enemy that operated like this  What a great loophole  Let's get a bunch of people from Somalia or from Afghanistan  Load up a ship 
[03:10:30]  Come over to the U.S.  Not as an army  Not as a representing a country  Did that happen?  No, let me just put this as a hypothetical example  Hypothetical  Now let them just sweep on in  And try to take over the United States with a little army  Yep  And now, instead of treating them as military combatants  We have to try each and every one of them  As a criminal with the same rules and regulations  No, I would say you don't give them any rights  You simply take them out back and execute them  Like the Wild West 
[03:11:00]  No, that's silly  No, that's what you're telling me  No, you're telling me there's now a loophole for invading our country  No, he's not  Who's invaded our country?  I'm saying there's a loophole now  The way you put it  If some entity wants to invade the United States  They can now do it without the repercussions of not having due process  They will then have due process?  The same things that we're afforded?  No  Yeah, not in our country  Yeah, it's crazy  Absolutely  I agree with you 
[03:11:30]  By God, take them out back and hang them  No, we should do it  Because you know that you're not going to be a victim of terrorism  So what we should do is just allow citizens to be slaughtered  We're not allowing anything  It's called great police work  No, no, no  Don't violate those civil liberties  Do not violate civil liberties  Do not profile  Do not investigate Muslims because they're Muslim  Because that's a profiling  And everybody on the left goes ballistic when you profile  Because that's not a 40-citizen's due process  You're profiling them  You judge them guilty before they were tried  So you can't do that 
[03:12:00]  Well, let's not leave it there either  We're also profiling the Mexicans  We should profile  We profile the Italians for the mafia  You profile bikers for health  Profiling works to a certain degree  As long as citizens are afforded a certain amount of respect  And I like the fact that now we don't even do it at the borders  Where are Mexicans being profiled?  Well, I drive across every year  And now the last time I drove across the border  I showed my passport at the border  And I was two hours into Arizona on the freeway 
[03:12:30]  And I had to do a two-hour stop there  Because the cars were backed up  Because it was an immigration stop in the middle of Arizona  Not at the border  But that seems logical  For the people that got across  Well, it only  Gee, it only goes against our Constitution  But what the hell  DWI checkpoints do it too, technically  No  Our Constitution says  You can travel freely  Inside the United States  So DWI checkpoints also  No, no, no, no  Why?  Because that's driving a car and a license 
[03:13:00]  And you're dealing with a cop  Same thing here  No, it isn't the same  This is immigration  So what?  You're checking to see if  So what?  You're a citizen  You're not being hassled if you're a citizen  Yes, you are  You're asked to produce  I already did it at the border  Same as DWI checkpoints  You're asked to prove your sobriety  No, it's different  It's not different  Yes, it is  It's different because it doesn't prove your point  But it's not different  Because driving is a privilege  Yes, they weren't stopping citizens walking  No, driving is a privilege  You don't have a right to drive  Right, exactly  It's a privilege  But you have a right to be a citizen 
[03:13:30]  It's your right not to be questioned  Inside the United States  Don't the police have a right to ask you  This isn't the police  This isn't the police  You're talking about the Border Patrol  This is immigration  Immigration  Oh, okay  So what right does immigration have to pull me over in the middle of Arizona  And ask me to produce papers that I'm a citizen  That seems a little shifting  Yeah, but they were stopping people because they wanted to make sure that they weren't illegals  They weren't looking for you  So what if they ask you to produce 
[03:14:00]  And I mean that  I refused  Of course you did  Because you're a recognizable guy  Because I believe in the Constitution  So do I  But again, it's not a suicide  No, you don't  Because you're saying that this is okay  You're right  I don't believe in the Constitution  Stop it  Stop it  I don't believe in the Constitution  You're violating it  No, I'm not  I'm exercising my free speech  Boo-hoo  Oh, Jesus  And time  Wow  I love the Constitution  It troubles me because  I don't like the perverse use of the Constitution  We're out in the middle in the United States  And you're asked to produce your citizenship 
[03:14:30]  When you've already done it at the border  And our country has never made us  Have to produce any type of thing like that  Just to freely travel about the country  Where are your papers?  Do you have to produce your  Where are your papers?  Can you leave Minnesota into South Dakota?  And I foresee in the future  They're going to have  Right at the borders  State to state  Where you're going to have to produce paperwork  To go from one state to the next  It's called easy pass  And that's called  And that's called  Taking away your freedoms 
[03:15:00]  In light of keeping us safe  Slippery  That's what you'd say  The police do  Let's keep us safe  That's what you'd say  About the police  Don't put word  Not in police work  That in police work  That's immigration  But if it was a cop  Say the cop had done it  No, no, no  It ain't a cop  You said it's all police work  To stop terrorists  So if they started questioning people  In a mosque  You'd say  Oh, that's racist  Don't put words in my mouth, please  I'm lying  You've done it to me  You did it to me  You said I don't believe in the Constitution  Bye, guys  Bye, Jess  Governor  You always just sulk and walk away 
[03:15:30]  Why?  You put words in my mouth  There's a fucking guy here  Telling me I got a schedule  You're using dirty language, asshole  Yeah  Yeah  Bye, tough guy  Bye, tough guy  And thanks for your service  To our country  You're welcome  Thanks for touching me  With your fucking stupid  Rip-riff-raff  Fucking Rocky Horror hairdo  You're bigger than me  And stronger than me  So what  I don't give a shit  You want to beat me up  Go ahead  I'm not going to fight a guy like you  That means nothing to me  I know 
[03:16:00]  I argued with you  You put words in my mouth  And you didn't like when I did it to you  You put words in my mouth  Saying  I didn't believe in the Constitution  And that's bullshit  It's not true  I don't agree with  Abusing it  Thank you for your service  Oh, you're welcome  You're a bigger patriot than me  Godspeed  Fuck out of here  Wow  What happened?  It's a fucking baby  What happened? 
[03:16:30]  That ended on a  A fucking baby  Who gives a shit?  A big fucking guy  That doesn't like the little guy yelling  You scared him, Jimmy  You scared him away  No, here's what that is  He wanted to knock my fucking block off  But he knows that he shouldn't  Or he can't  Because of the law  Or all this stuff  Fuck you  I don't care  I fucking hate that shit  What happened, Sam?  I really do  Don't fight  I bow to you  I would never  So do I  I would never  I saw the look Jesse was giving you 
[03:17:00]  I don't care  I would never try to challenge a guy like that physically  And I don't posture that way  He would murder me  You're like fucking Spider  You're just like Spider  I want to talk to your money  I would never talk  Tough guy talk  I was arguing an ideological point  I would never get in Jesse Ventura's face  And think I'm going to outman him  That was not my point  And I've never done that  Don't fucking tough guy me  I hate that  He was tough guy  I'll fuck him  I don't care how strong he is  I hate that  You are  Bravo to Jim  That drives me nuts, man  That's my fucking pet peeve 
[03:17:30]  I hate it  Suicide by wrestler  Was what he was trying  Holy shit  Suicide by wrestler  But it's not a tough guy thing  The guy would  It's not about that  I'm not going to fight Jesse Ventura  I just  I can't be bullied  It makes me  Fuck  Fuck you  I hate it  How'd you feel when he tapped your shoulder?  Annoyed  Not intimidated  Annoyed  Annoyed  Thank you for your service  He didn't do it hard  It wasn't a threatening  But it was  Don't try to alpha mail me, stupid  Danny just put up a picture of the Crypt Keeper 
[03:18:00]  Danny's real brave  Jimmy's the only one that opened his mouth like a man  I fucking  Dude  Like a man  That drives me crazy  That was a great ending  That drives me nuts  Wow  What is he saying down the hall there?  Who cares?  Who cares?  I'm just curious  I asked him if  If when his book comes out in April  He'd be happy to come back  Because despite the tumult  That really sounded well  He goes  Nope  Not doing it  Good  Fuck you  Bye  Don't  We're done with him?  Don't  We've had intense discussions with the guy 
[03:18:30]  I walked with him into the elevator  And he always comes back  And I said  Governor  I know that your feelings may have gotten hurt  And you don't like Jim  Who cares?  I don't like him either  He's a sulker  I don't respect that little shit  I don't respect him either  I respect his military service  But I think he's a fucking  I don't respect him in a debate  Because he's a baby  Who pushes his microphone  Aww  What's the matter  You're not used to being challenged  By a small guy  You fucking  Big dumb wrestler  I fucking hate that shit  I mean  By the way 
[03:19:00]  I never  It's not like I stood up  And go  I would never do that dude  People are saying  Best ending ever  By the way  Yes we did get that on video  And boy  Will that  I don't give a shit  If he comes back  That's a big one  I don't care  That's a big one  I swear to god  I don't care  If he comes back  Wait till you see  Jesse's face  On that video  Honest to god  He wanted  To strangle you  Too bad  I know  Then don't argue with me  On the radio  Just bully me in an alley  Like you probably would have  If you weren't a dumb  Fucking wrestler  I fucking hate big guys 
[03:19:30]  I'm afraid of Jimmy  No I'm not  Be more funny  Dude I really  I hate that shit  I fucking hate that shit  Bravo  I mean  I hate it  Honestly there's nothing  I can say  The listeners can say  Anthony can say  It's a bravo  All the way around  So trust me  I would never have  Tried to speak that way  That Jesse gave you  Bravo  Wait till you see  This fucking video  Nose to nose  And just  You did not back down  An iota  But stay  No I won't back down  I know  But again  If it came down  To a real fight  The acknowledgement is 
[03:20:00]  The guy's gonna murder me  I'm not gonna fight  Jesse  It's not about that  It's an argument  Even if it was a small guy  Or a woman I was arguing with  Which is what I am to him  It was that whole  Push the mic away  Yeah yeah  Don't try to fucking  Alpha mail me in an argument  That's what he was doing  We had a really good discussion  With the guy too  Why did it have to end there  Because he's a guy like  You know what  I'll tell you  I know why  I started fading out  I'll be completely honest  What got to him at the end there  I didn't like when he goes  Well you don't like the constitution  He doesn't like me  Because I don't agree with him  And I'm fucking  Don't put fucking words in my mouth 
[03:20:30]  He put fucking words in my mouth  And then he called me an asshole  And I called him an asshole  And when Jimmy called him out  I'm putting words in his mouth  He had no defense for it  Because that's what he is  He's one of those big bully motherfuckers  Who likes to use his size and his weight  And he talks over everybody  And he's not a dumb guy  I'm not gonna say  So what  Fuck him  He's not a dumb guy  He's not a dumb guy  I just want to see Jimmy look  I just disagree with him  Don't turn around Jimmy  Don't turn around  I respect the guy's military service  I respect the guy  He's a bright dude  He's not a dumb guy  He's just more radical than I am  But that  When you're arguing 
[03:21:00]  And that disagreeing  That fucking  Like that's all of a sudden  The atomic bomb  I'm gonna use my  Fuck you man  You know what you should do?  Bend him over and humble him  You fuck in the ass  I fuck you in the ass  And humble you  I don't care if he  That little shit  That's what I think of you  You big fat motherfucker  Beat it  There was a point  No  I'm sorry  There was a point  When Jimmy turned all the way around  Jesse was at the doorway  Jesse was debating  On coming back in  So much  I know  I'm just saying  I know he was  I'm just painting the picture 
[03:21:30]  For everyone  There was a moment there  Where Jesse was like  At all  I think I gotta go back in there  And hit this guy  I was scared for you  And then at the last second  Turned and walked away  Cause when he drank his water  And finished the bottle  I thought he was gonna throw the bottle  And I would've thrown mine at him  And got the shit beat out of me  Believe me  That's what I was thinking  That's why I started getting afraid  And then Kenny would've had to come in  And oh it would've been awful  Kenny  I wanna talk to Kenny for a minute  I wanna know what Kenny was thinking  I've been boxing lately  I would've tried something  Dude I'm more  Would you knock it off 
[03:22:00]  Dude I would be annoyed  At a small guy  For pushing the microwave  During an argument  But Jesse was having  A lot of time  To say what he had to say  Yeah  We were arguing back and forth  He felt I put words in his mouth  I felt he put words in mine  But then to drop it like  Goodbye  I know  Fuck you  We're promoting your show  For the last 20 minutes  Ask plenty of legitimate questions  Yes  Let him get his point across  Over and over again  Oh it drives me crazy  Where would've been  That fail safe point  Where you had to jump in  Cause you  You held off  You didn't do anything 
[03:22:30]  You didn't get in between anybody  What were you thinking  During that whole thing  I was keeping my eye on him  Yeah  Now what would you think  If you had to go against  Jesse Ventura  Bye Jim  Ronnie B's in studio  We almost lost Jimmy today  Ronnie  I swear to god  True story  I'm downstairs  And saw Ventura  Go through the turnstiles twice  He just kept  I'm not even fucking making it up  He just kept  Walking around  And pushing  I guess he was pushing it so hard 
[03:23:00]  He didn't realize  How to get out  Fuck him  He was angry  I fucking hate bull  Jimmy you didn't serve  Jesus cross  You know what  In that argument  That drives me nuts too  Because I'm not one of these  I have nothing but respect  For the military  And I hate  I've said it 50 times  Pull them out of everywhere  Fuck the rest of the world  Don't get our guys killed  For fucking North Korea  Or anybody  Fuck all of them  Ah it makes me sick  It was amazing  Ronnie  Holy shit  He did that last time  The look that Jesse gave 
[03:23:30]  The look that Jimmy gave  That's a pretty good impression  There was some crazy  There was some crazy  There was some crazy  There was some crazy  There was some crazy  There was some crazy  There was some crazy  Wow  Well I guess everyone's  Going to tune in  To his show tonight  Hey watch the show  It's probably a good show  As long as you don't  Watch it Thursday through Sunday  When I'm at Caroline  I don't care what you do  And the video was angry  The video of the confrontation  Later on this afternoon  You gotta see this one  Holy shit  I saw it live  I had to turn my head  At one point  I was  I was scared  I did not want to see you  Get hit 
[03:24:00]  Not that I didn't want  To see it happen  I literally did not  Want to see it  So I turned away  Thinking you absolutely  Were gonna get  Fucking clocked  It was  Hold on  It was intense too  Cause Sam's on the  The video  Yeah  And I go whisper  To Sam  Get closer  Get closer  And Sam's like  No fuck no  Oh you got a  Fucking close up of him  He's got a zoom lens  Show Ronnie be the look  The good thing though  Is if you would've got a hit  It would've been fake hit  Where they hit their  And then if you needed to  You could just start  Going like this  Till the audience got behind you 
[03:24:30]  We'd all start clapping  Yeah  Hold some  Stupid hairdo  Jimmy everyone's saying bravo  Simple as that  It's not even that  I would never  I would never come at the guy  Physically  You know what  You stood up for a lot of people  Out there that have been  In that situation  With a big tough guy  And you know what  You fucking stood right  Right in there  Because I would never yell  At a guy who weighed  100 pounds  That's why people say bravo today  Like I would never  I don't bully people  Who are smaller than me  Most people in your situation  Walk away  Trust me  They just do  Yeah  Red, white, and boo  The worst of Opie and Anthony 
[03:25:00]  Memorial Day special continues  Here's your host  Comedian and guy who went to a rock once  Bob Kelly  Nice  Love Spanish broads  Right  Because they have those  Adam's apples  They look like nothing  Hey it's Robert Kelly  Hosting  The Opie and Anthony  Red, white, and boo  Our horrible attempt  At saluting  Those who have served  Our country proudly  In this segment  We talk to Clint Hill  He's the former  Secret Service agent 
[03:25:30]  To the Kennedy administration  He's the guy  On the back of the car  Helping Jackie out  After the assassination  He talks about  His new book  In which he shares  His life  And times  Protecting the former  First lady  It's the worst  Of the Opie and Anthony show  Well your book  What a fascinating subject  Because I guess a lot of people  Think they've heard  Or read  Or seen  Everything they  Could possibly have  About the assassination  Itself  But as Jimmy said earlier  You humanized this whole thing 
[03:26:00]  You put an element to it  Where  These were real people  You included  That saw  History happen  I was a witness to history  In many ways  And it all happened  Right in front of me  Could we see  The Zapruder film  It's such a famous event  It's just an event  Like the humanity of it  Is lost a lot of times  Because it's just something  You see  Like the bomb dropping  But you talk about  The trip to Parkland Memorial  And you go through  So much of the  Can I go back  When you first 
[03:26:30]  Got assigned to  Jacqueline Kennedy  You didn't see that  As necessarily a good thing  No  I wanted to be with the president  I'd been with  President Eisenhower  And we'd been all over  Europe and South America  And Southeast Asia  And I had witnessed  What previous first ladies  Had done  Which meant  Going to  Tea parties in the afternoon  Fashion shows  Things of that nature  And I didn't want  Any part of that  I wanted to be  Where the action was  And that was with the president  So when I got the assignment 
[03:27:00]  And went to meet her  I wasn't enthusiastic about it  And she wasn't enthusiastic  About my being there  Because she didn't like  The idea of somebody  Being with her  24 hours a day  The rest of her life  So it took a while  For us to gradually  Gain each other's trust  And we did  And we became  Very very close  Over a period of time  And what was your  First indication  That this was going  To be a different detail 
[03:27:30]  Than Eisenhower  Because of her activity  A lot of people  Don't know how active  She was  I mean here she was  An accomplished horse woman  She rode  As often as she could  With  The hunt group  Out in the  Virginia countryside  Chasing foxes  She  Loved to water ski  She loved to play tennis  She loved to play golf  And if she wasn't doing that  She'd be walking  And she  She was very 
[03:28:00]  Very active  Well previous first ladies  Had never been active  Like this  So that was  The first hint  That oh this is  Going to be different  Wow yeah  And then she  Decided that she  Was going to spend  A lot of time  Away from the White House  They leashed a place  In the country  In Middleburg Virginia  And we went there  Almost every weekend  While we were in  The Washington area  We weren't doing that  We were up to  And from New York  And then they had  A regular routine  In the Kennedy family 
[03:28:30]  They would go to  Hinesport for the  Fourth of July  For Labor Day  For Thanksgiving  Palm Beach Florida  For Christmas  New Year's  And Easter  And then she also  Liked to go to Europe  And to cruise  On the Mediterranean  So  It was going to be  Really an active  And interesting  Experience  And it was  And there's  All this talk  About JFK's  Extracurricular activity 
[03:29:00]  And stuff like that  You know  It's just become  Kind of I guess  Legend  You know  With information  Past now  Politicians  You know  So much  Under such a  Bigger microscope  Was she  Aware of that  I mean  Because I've heard  Different things  That she knew  And that she didn't  Know  Or was it just  Something that  It didn't seem  To be noticed  Well she and I  Never discussed it  Of course  I heard the rumors  She heard the rumors  Obviously  But it was never  A matter of discussion  Between us  And I never discussed it 
[03:29:30]  With any other agents  So I really  Didn't know anything  About that  So there wasn't  This  You guys would  Get together  And kind of  Start telling  Telling tales  Not at all  I read to it  And again  It's not that  You just want to  Harp on the assassination  But it is  You know  It's an amazing  Piece of history  Absolutely  What I read  Your account of it  Was interesting  Because you said  That you thought  Because we've always  Thought that the first shot  Skips  Hits James Tag  In the cheek  And then the second shot  Goes through the back  Of the throat  And then the third shot  Is the final shot  But you said  You thought the first shot 
[03:30:00]  Actually hit him  And you didn't hear  The second shot  That's right  First shot hit him  In the middle  Middle of the back  Way up at the neckline  And came out  Through the stroke  Actually was not  Would not have been  A fatal wound  Second shot  Did not hit him  And Mrs. Conley  Who was sitting  Next to her husband  Was the best judge  Of that  And she said  The second shot  Is the shot  That hit her husband  Wow  That is where  The magic bullet  Theory comes in  Which I don't  Believe in either  Oh that was actually  Two bullets then  Well yeah 
[03:30:30]  What they assume  Was one magic bullet  Was actually two shots  This was  At that time  The attorney was  Warren Spector  I think his name was  Warren Spector  And that was his theory  That this bullet  Did all these  Tips and turns  And did all this damage  I don't  You don't buy that one  Describe to that  No  Yeah  We had another agent  Say that too  That he thought  Remember  Who wrote a book  Recently  And he called in  And he said  That he thought  That the first  Yeah  The first bullet  Actually struck  I'm sure it did 
[03:31:00]  Because that's why  I reacted  Did you know  Immediately what it was  You didn't think  It was a car backfiring  Or were you not sure  I wasn't sure  Exactly what it was  I heard the explosive noise  But when I saw him react  Then I realized  That something had happened  And I jumped and ran  And when I was running  It was a second shot  Apparently I didn't even hear it  How big of a threat  Were you expecting  Knowing that  Now in hindsight  It's kind of hard  To assess that  But at the time  We hear about  That there was  Kind of this threat 
[03:31:30]  That it might be dangerous  For him to go to Dallas  Were you aware of this?  We didn't  There wasn't a thought  That it was any more dangerous  To go into Dallas  Than any other place  In the south  At that time  We had really  No intelligence information  That would indicate  There was going to be  That certain  A problem  We knew that  The ambassador  To the United Nations  Alex Stevenson  Had been in Dallas  And that  He had not received  A warm reception 
[03:32:00]  He'd been spit on  And things of that nature  Yeah, yeah  We knew that  There was a general  Who was retired  Living in Dallas  Named Walker  Sitting in his office  One day  And somebody shot at him  Miss  But the bullet  Lodged in the paneling  Behind his head  Didn't they say  That was Oswald  That actually did it?  Wow  That's what it turned out  To be  They pulled the slug  Out of the paneling  And when they got  Oswald's rifle  From the sixth floor  Where he had hidden it  Near the stairway  And they checked it  Ballistically  It was 
[03:32:30]  That  Bullet was fired  From the same gun  Wow  And you know  Because you were right there  You heard the shot  Come from over  From behind you  From my right rear  Why  And I know  That again  Hindsight's 20-20  But  Was it typical  To allow open windows  Or things like that  And why did they  Allow the car  To take that turn  That just seemed  Such a dangerous  Was that just  A judgment error  By whoever  I'm not a conspiracy  I actually believe  Oswald did do it  But was that just  A judgment error  By the agent charge  Or it wasn't  A judgment error  At all  The situation was 
[03:33:00]  Insofar as  Open windows  That was  Par for the course  No matter if  We were in Europe  South America  Or in this country  And to be honest  In 1963  Buildings didn't have  Central air conditioning  For the most part  A lot of them  Right  Yeah  Open a window  Right  And people open windows  And in this case  People were  Hanging out of windows  They were on balconies  And rooftops  So that was not  That unusual  Don't you find  Things get lost  In history 
[03:33:30]  And these conspiracy  Theories  And then you spell  Something out  So simply  And that absolutely  Seems to be the most  Logical, reasonable  Explanation as to why  The windows are open  Well that's it  And you ask about  Why did we take that route  Why did we make that  Left hand turn  On Elm Street  Our destination  Was the trademark  In Dallas  Which was just off  The Stamins Freeway  We were coming down  Main Street  Now Main Street  If we would have  Gone straight ahead  We would not have 
[03:34:00]  Been able to  Turn right onto  Stamins Freeway  Which is what we  Had to do in order  To get to the trademark  The only way to get  There was to turn  Right onto Houston  Then turn left  Onto Elm  Go onto the  Triple underpass  Then get on the  Freeway  Other than that  We couldn't have  Gone to the  To the trademark  That way  Wow  This is a simple  Explanation  That makes a lot  More sense  Than some convoluted  There was actually  A barricade  At the end  Of Main Street  Where Stamins Freeway 
[03:34:30]  Was that you  Couldn't have  Turned right  And can you  And then you  Started  You heard the shot  And you ran  Towards the car  And there's the  Very famous moment  Of Mrs. Kennedy  Coming back on the car  And there was all  The speculation  At first they thought  Was she trying to  Help and pull you  Into the car  Because it looked  Like you were  Struggling  It appears that way  But that was not  What happened  When the president  Was hit in the head  With the third bullet  The explosion  Was so severe  In the head  That bone fragments 
[03:35:00]  And blood  And brain matter  Erupted from the wound  Some of it came off  And went to the right rear  Across the trunk  Of the car  She saw that  And she was trying  To reach some  Of that material  She didn't even  Know I was there  This is what  She testified to later  And then when  I grabbed her  And put her back  In the back seat  And she sat down  Then his body  Fell into her  Its head in her lap  Wow  So  And you were  Holding on for dear life  As you guys 
[03:35:30]  Are speeding towards  Parkland Memorial  Yeah  We were running  Upwards of 80 miles an hour  Wow  And you were just  Holding on to the  Well I kind of  Wedged myself  In between the two  Sides of the car  Wow  So  I lost my sunglasses  They blew off  Yeah  You said that  That was the speed  You just turned  Your head in the glass  Which means  If you would have  Let go  And the car  Behind you  Was you said  Within five feet  Right there  All the time  Did you  Did you know  That moment  That it was a fatal shot  I thought it was  As soon as I saw him  Lying in her lap 
[03:36:00]  Because his eyes  Were fixed  Because I could  Actually see  Into his head  From the wound  Wow  And I could see  A lot of the brain  Matter was gone  And so I gave  The follow-up car crew  A thumbs down  Wow  What was the sound  Wow  When that  Because there's a  Pruder film  It's silent  And again  There's that  Cop radio  That might have  Been left on  Which they try  To get acoustics  From  But the sound  You describe  Of the shot  Is so  It's just like  I can  Can you describe it 
[03:36:30]  It's like  A bullet  Hitting something  Very hard  But hollow  Oh wow  Yeah  Something like  A melon  Similar  And  And it caused  It caused  The wound  To open up  And then it  Caused a flap  The skin  From the  Exterior of the skull  Didn't actually  Come off  Part of it  Was intact  And so it just  Kind of  Made a flap  That went forward  Oh flopped up  Wow  That's what you see  In the film  Was she saying 
[03:37:00]  Anything  In the car  Or was she  Quiet  Or was anybody  Saying anything  She was in shock  Yeah  But she did say  That oh  They shot his head off  And then she just said  Jack  Jack  What have they done  To you  Wow  As you guys  Were going  Or once  As we were  As we were  Moving  And what happened  When you got  To the hospital  Because I know  That they had  To get Connolly  Out  In order to  To get the  President out  Of the  You know  Fold the jump seat  The jump seats  Were where  Connolly  Mrs. Connolly  And the governor  Were seated  Which is right  In front of  The president  Mrs. Kennedy 
[03:37:30]  In order to get  The president out  We had to get  Connolly out first  To fold those  Jump seats down  And so that  Took a little time  And then we  Were going to  Move the president  But she wouldn't  Let go of the body  Because she didn't  Want anybody  I thought anyway  She didn't want  Anybody to see  What he looked like  Oh wow  So I took my jacket off  And I covered his head  And his upper back  When I did that  She let go  Then we lifted him up  And put him on a gurney  And took him into  The emergency room  And what was your  First feeling  When you knew  He had  Because you talk  It's interesting to hear  You talk in the book  About failure 
[03:38:00]  And you felt like  You failed  Or that you  Well there's no  No question about that  We had a responsibility  And we failed  In that responsibility  There's no question  About that at all  And I personally  Had the feeling  That because I was  The only agent  In a position  Since the way  We were positioned  That day  I was in a  Follow-up car  Left side  In the front  When the  Sound of the  Explosive noise  Came  My eyes  Scanned from 
[03:38:30]  Where I was looking  On my left-hand side  Across the  President's car  I saw what happened  The other agents  Were scanning  Away from the car  Toward the sound  Noise  They didn't see  What happened  I was the only one  Who had that  Opportunity  And I was  Unable to get there  But if you  Could have jumped in  And taken the shot  You would have  Oh absolutely  Certainly  What trained you  For that  What trained you  For the ability  To throw your body  In front of a bullet  I mean just because  It's against every  Instinct  Yeah  Well I guess it is  But it's just  Something that you 
[03:39:00]  Recognize when you  Accept that job  That that may be  A possibility  And when you guys  Left  I know that  You left  D.C.  And you told  It was interesting  In the book  Where you talked about  How his son  Liked to go on  The helicopter  And he liked to  Take his son  On the helicopter  With him  John loved  Helicopters  And he  That morning  They had agreed  To allow him  To ride with him  From the White House  To Andrews Air Force Base  Where Air Force One  Was located  And so Agent Foster  Came with him  And we flew  From the White House 
[03:39:30]  To Andrews  And then  Mommy and Daddy  Got off to get  On Air Force One  And he really  Started to cry  He wanted to go  With him  We knew he  Couldn't go  And the President  Miskenny knew  He couldn't go  So they tried  To appease him  A little bit  And then the  President turned  To Agent Foster  And said  Agent Foster  Well you look  After John  Until I get back  And that really  Aided us  Over the years  Because we  We knew what  Happened  And he did  Come back  So that bothered 
[03:40:00]  Us a great deal  What was the last  Thing he said  To his son  They mentioned  To him  They mentioned to him  That we'll be  Back  And we'll bring  You back  Something special  For your birthday  Because his birthday  Was the next  Monday  The 25th  And that would  Turn out to be  The day  Of the funeral  Wow  That's rough  Yeah it's really  It's these things  That you just  I've never heard  Any of this stuff  Before told  From the perspective  Because you're  The agent  Everybody mentions  Not in a negative  Way but just as  The most famous  Agent associated 
[03:40:30]  I was there  Yeah you were there  Because you were there  And you saw  Were you the one  To there was  An interesting thing  Where in Park Memorial  You talked to  Robert Kennedy  Yes I had  I was on the phone  With the White House  Talking to my  Supervisor  And the operator  Cut in and said  Mr. Hill  The Attorney General  Let's talk to you  And apparently  He had received  A call from  J. Edgar Hoover  And he  Hoover just simply  Said to him  That  The president 
[03:41:00]  Has been shot  He didn't  Give him any  More than that  So when the  Attorney General  Talked to me  He said  Clint  He said  What's going on  Down there  So I explained  To him  That the governor  Had been shot  His brother  Had been shot  The president  And that we're  In Parkland Memorial  Hospital  In the emergency  Section  And he didn't  Realize how bad  It was  And so he said  Well how bad  Is it  Now I did not  Want to tell him  That his brother  Was dead  So I just  Simply said  It's as bad  As it can get  And when I said  That he just  Hung up  Wow 
[03:41:30]  And you  Describe the mood  In the hospital  It just  When you read  It seemed  Unimaginably  Hopeless  This  Feeling you guys  Seem to be having  Like almost like  In a zombie state  Walking around  Not quite  Believing what  Had just happened  Well you know  We were  Emotionally  Really  It really  Hit us  But we had  A job to do  Still  And in the  Hospital  I'll say this  For the  Staff  They did  Everything  They could  Trying to  Revive him 
[03:42:00]  They didn't  Leave anything  Left  Were you in the  Room when they  Were trying to  Revive him  I was on the  Phone right  Outside the  Room  My supervisor  Went in and  Out of the  Room  And Mrs.  Kenney  Went in and  Out of the  Room  And they  Tried to stop  Her at one  Point didn't  They from  Going in  Yes just  Before they  They decided  That it was  Hopeless and  They was going  To pronounce  Him dead  And the  Dr.  Berkeley  Interceded  And permitted  Her to go  Into the  Room  Oh because  They just  So she  Could be  With him  When he  When he  Died  Were there 
[03:42:30]  Moments  That like  As you  You go  Through  Talking about  Bringing the  Casket on  Air Force  One  Were there  Moments  Where you  Would  Kind of  Go in  And out  Of  Believing  What  Happened  Like  Were there  Moments  Where  You'd  See  Something  That it  Would  Just  Hit  You  The  Reality  Of  What  Was  Happening  Because  You said  Keeping  Busy  Is  Kind of  What  Kept  You  Going  It  Was  That  Really  Kept  You  Going  And  When  You  If  You  Had  Any  Down  Time  It's  When  You  Got  To  Thinking  And  You  Would  Go  Into  A  Really  Deep  Depression  So  The  Thing  Was  Keep  Busy  Yeah  Well  We  Were  Able  To  Do  That  Because  There  Were  So  Few  Of  Us  And 
[03:43:00]  There  Was  Nobody  To  Replace  Us  And  We  Didn't  Have  Any  Counseling  Get Bethesda  And  Everything  And  The  Body  Was  Placed  In  East  Room  Around  430  In  The  Morning  About  Six  I  Felt  Comfortable  With  Mrs.  Kennedy  Being  Up  In  The  Second  Level  To  Leave  The  Area  And  Go  Home 
[03:43:30]  For  A  While  So  I  Went  Home  And  Changed  Clothes  Showered  Got  A  Little  Bit  To  Eat  And  I  Came  Right  Back  And  I  Worked  All  That  Next  Day  Until  Midnight  Came  Back  Early  On  Sunday  Morning  Worked  All  That  Day  Again  Until  Midnight  What  Were  Your  Duties  In  The  Days  After  That  During  The  Funeral  Yeah  Like  In  Between  Leading  Up  To  The  Funeral  When  You  Got  Back  To  Washington  In  Between  That  And  The  Funeral  What  Were  Your  Day  To  Day  I  Was  Standing  By  For  Her  Most  Of  The  Time  And  Trying 
[03:44:00]  To  Answer  Questions  She  Wanted  To  Do  Certain  Things  In  The  Funeral  For  Example  She  Wanted  To  Walk  Right  And  Not  Just  From  The  White  House  To  St.  Matthew  The  Whole  Way  She  Wanted  To  Walk  The  Whole  Way  And  How  Long  Would  That  Have  Been  From  The  White  House  To  The  Capitol  And  Back  From  The  Capitol  To  The  White  House  To  St.  Matthews  To  Arlington  National  Cemetery  Yeah  That's  A lot  Of  Walking  It's  Possible  No  Problem  I  Mean  With  Her  Condition  She  Could  Have  Done  It  Sure  But 
[03:44:30]  It  Was  A  Security  Nightmare  Because  It  Was  Just  Not  She  And  The  Children  And  Family  Members  It  Was  The  President  And  His  Wife  First  Lady  Mrs.  Johnson  It  Was  All  The  Visiting  Heads  Of  State  Including  Charles  De  Gaufe  France  And  Haide  Selassie  From  Ethiopia  The  Presidents  Of  Ireland  Germany  Just  All  You  Over  A hundred  Heads  Of  State  There  So  Finally  At  Bride  Down  She  Agreed 
[03:45:00]  That  She  Would  Just  Walk  From  The  White  House  To  St.  Matthews  Which  Was  Better  Than  The  Original  Plan  Of  Walking  Right  To  Protect  Because  They  Were  Going  To  Walk  If  She  Walked  They  Couldn't  Oh  There  Was  No  Question  About  That  They  Weren't  Going  To  Get  In  A  Car  And  Follow  This  Lady  Walking  Down  Street  When  Was  The  Last  Time  You  Actually  Saw  Her  At  The  Funeral  For  Robert  Kennedy  In  1968  And  Then  She  Got  Married  That  Fall  So  You  Saw  Her  At  The  Funeral  Did  You  Speak  At  All  At  Robert  Funeral  Not  Not  Because  I  Was  At  That  Time  The  Agent  In  Charge  Of 
[03:45:30]  Presidential  Protection  I  Was  With  President  Johnson  I  So  You  Didn't  Get  A  Chance  When  Was  The  Last  Time  You  Actually  Got  A  Chance  To  Speak  To  Her  I  Talked  To  Her  Periodically  Between  1964  When  I  Left  And  Returned  To  The  White  House  And  1968  She  Would  Call  Sometimes  About  Things  About  The  Children  Usually  About  Some  Of  The  Security  Coverage  For  The  Children  She  Was  Always  Concerned  About  You  Know  The  Children  Being  Allowed  To  Do  Certain  Things  And  So  I 
[03:46:00]  Would  Talk  To  Her  About  That  Did  You  Miss  Her  On  A  Personal  Level  Very  Much  So  Really  Yeah  She  Was  A  Wonderful  Person  A  Lot  Of  Fun  Yeah  And  You  Know  There's  Been  This  Speculation  People  I  Know  People  Have  Asked  You  About  It  If  You  Were  In  Love  With  Her  And  I  Kind  Of  It  Sounds  Like  A  Trite  Question  But  Reading  You  Said  Something  About  When  She  Looked  At  You  And  You  Said  There  Was 
[03:46:30]  We  Knew  Each  Other  Very  Well  She  Knew  My  Secrets  I  Knew  Her  Secrets  So  We  Had  A  Very  Close  Relationship  And  I  Knew  What  She  Was  Thinking  About  Things  That  She  Like  Didn't  Like  When  You  Are  Away  With  Someone  Like  That  Is  It  Hard  Not  To  Feel  Connected  On  That  Level  Because  Even  Though  You  There  To  Protect  Her  And  You  Working  I  Mean  She  Still  A  Person  And 
[03:47:00]  My  Responsibility  She  Also  Became  Probably  My  Closest  Best  Friend  At  Time  But  So  It  Was  Kind  Of  A  Combination  Thing  And  When  She  I  Know  She  Died  In  94  She  Passed  With  I  Think  Non  Hodgkins  Right  Yeah  May  Of  1994  And  I  Know  You  Said  You  Were  Tempted  To  To  Speak  To  Her  When  You  Heard  That  She  Was  Very  Sick  Yeah  I  Wanted  To  Call  Her  But  I  Had  A  Sense 
[03:47:30]  That  Just  Hearing  My  Voice  Would  Bring  Back  Those  Days  And  I  Didn't  Want  That  To  Happen  And  I  Knew  Hearing  Your  Voice  Would  Bring  It  Back  To  Me  To  So  You  You  Attempted  To  Call  Me  You  Just  Decided  I  Thought  In  The  Best  Interest  Everybody  Not  To  Do  It  Is  Is  Something  That  You  Regret  I  Would  Like  To  Talk  To  To  But  Probably  Best  That  We  Didn't  Did  She  Die  Soon  After  You  Found  Out  Was  It  Like  It  Wasn't  Enough  Time  Oh  Yeah  She  I  Went  Into  The  White  House  President  Called  President  Clinton  Called  And  His  Agent  Called  Me  And 
[03:48:00]  Wanted  Me  To  Come  Into  The  White  House  And  So  I  Did  And  She  Died  That  Night  So  There  Wasn't  Any  Time  Oh  The  Night  You  I  Read  That  Clinton  Wanted  To  Meet  Clinton  And  Obama  And  All  These  Guys  Who  I  Mean  Because  Every  American  President  Since  Kennedy  Even  If  They  Didn't  Like  Him  Politically  Kind  Of  Revered  Him  With  The  Except  Maybe  Of  Nixon  Who  Knew  Him  Or  People  Who  Knew  Him  They  Must  All  Want  To  Just  Ask  You  What  He  Was  Like  Or  What 
[03:48:30]  He  What  Type  Of  Person  He  Did  Feel  Rude  When  He  Would  Say  That  No  No  Because  He  Was  Here  Was  A  Guy  Been  A  General  Yeah  And  You  Know  We  Were  Part  Of  Part  Of  His  Troops  And  So  That  Was  The  Easiest  Thing  Do  Hey 
[03:49:00]  So  They  Talk  To  Us  Here  But  Say  Scum  With  President  Kennedy  It  Was  First  Name  Basis  And  He  Asked  About  Your  Family  And  He  Knew  Every  One  Of  He  Really  Was  That  Charismatic  Guy  That  Everybody  Was  But  It  Seemed  Like  When  He  Was  In  The  Room  With  The  First  Lady  It  Seemed  Like  She  Was  The  One  Everybody  Focused  On  Like  She  Was  The  Only  Person  That  Seemed  To  Be  Larger  Than  Life  Than  He  Was  When  They  Were  That  Was  True  When  We  Go  To  Overseas  To  A  Country  And  She 
[03:49:30]  Would  Draw  Just  Tremendous  Crowds  Wherever  Her  Presence  And  Then  The  Fact  That  She  Spoke  Foreign  Languages  That  Mostly  In  The  Countries  We  Were  Visiting  That  Just  Made  It  That  Much  More  That  She  Was  Popular  Among  The  People  And  I'm  Sure  You  Have  Stuff  From  That  Time  In  Your  Life  What  Is  Your  Most  Prized 
[03:50:00]  Thing  That  You  Have  From  The  Can  I'm  Sure  Over  The  They  Gave  You  Something  Was  A  Note  Or  Something  That  You  Got  From  Them  Well  I  Have  So  Many  Things  One  Of  The  Things  I  Have  Is  A  Metal  That  I  Was  Metal  I  Mean  It  Was  A  Paper  Made  Handmade  Metal  With  A  Paper  Chain  That  The  President  Placed  Around  My  Neck  After  Having  Walked  50  Miles  With  His  Brother  In-law  And  His  Best  Friend  In  My  Four  Time  Shoes  Why  Did  You  Walk  50  Miles  It 
[03:50:30]  Was  A  Spur  Of  The  Moment  Decision  By  Mrs.  Kennedy  On  A  Friday  Evening  In  Palm  Beach  Florida  She  Called  Me  Up  I  Had  Gone  Off  Work  And  She  And  The  President  Were  Going  Out  To  Dinner  And  My  Assistant  Was  With  Them  And  She  Called  And  Said  Oh  Mr.  Hill  She  Said  President  I  Want  You  To  Do  Something  I  Said  Well  What  Can  I  Do  For  You  And  She  Said  Do  You  Prince  Radziwill  Is  Here  And  Chuck  Spaulding  Is  Down  Here  And  They  Are  Going  For  A  50  Mile  Hike  And 
[03:51:00]  The  President  And  I  Are  Going  To  Come  Out  And  See  Them  Periodically  And  So  We  Know  That  One  Of  The  Agents  Is  Going  To  Be  Out  There  In  Advance  And  We  Like  For  You  To  Do  That  And  To  Make  Sure  That  Everything  Is  Okay  For  The  Prince  And  Charlie  So  I  This  Is  Like  Eight  O'clock  On  A  Friday  Night  I  Said  Okay  Mrs.  Kennedy  I  Said  When  Do  They  Want  To  Go  She  They  Planning  To  Leave  About  Midnight  I  Thought  Oh  My  God  How  Am  I  Going  To  Do  This  So  I  I  I  I  I  I  I  I  I 
[03:51:30]  I  I  I  I  I  I  I  I  I  I  I  I  I  I  I  I  I  I  I  I 
[03:52:00]  I  I  I  24 hours and you carry obviously you all carry weapons um is is is there uh the secret service  doesn't just you didn't just have a pistol what do they give you like a a i've heard the secret  the agents could put a gun together really quickly anthony you may know listening to this i don't  know you're hilarious well no i don't know uh what weapons they they carry i'm sure you yeah 
[03:52:30]  you had some kind of heavier stuff than just your uh well on that hike i didn't oh you didn't you  just have your revolver i had a two and a half in smith oh okay yeah what did the agents carry in  1962 i'm sure it's different than what they have today most of them carried four inch  38 caliber weapons old service revolver kind of a thing yeah that was the standard issue and what  about if you needed a little bigger punch they eventually went to a magnum oh okay were there  any uh little submachine guns underneath some of the uh clothing first we used thompson 45 oh man 
[03:53:00]  that's a kind of a big thing to hide yeah well yeah heavy heavy then they went to an ar-15  again a little big then we went to an uzi oh okay yeah you guys carry us a little smaller then wow  how much do you how annoying do you find the conspiracy theorists who say things that you just  know isn't true they're very annoying but i have gotten to the point i just ignore them because 
[03:53:30]  it's most of it is so foolish and stupid that it just it's not believable by anybody i can't see how  they believe it was was there ever one you heard that made you go like huh because you always hear  one thing that makes you like oh that makes that's possible one was that the driver of the  presidential vehicle turned drew his revolver and fired and shot the president well if you knew  the configuration of the car and where all the people were seated it was impossible for him to do 
[03:54:00]  it and if he'd have tried he'd have probably hit mrs kennedy in the head because at the time of the shot  she would have been almost between the driver and the president the second one was that the guy that  was handling the heavy weapon in the follow-up car george hickey that was his name shot the president  with that weapon and it's just so he was in the back of the follow-up car between the president's 
[03:54:30]  closest political aide kenny o'donnell and the president's personal closest friend dave powers  and uh don't think they would have allowed that well and back there with him was another  intelligence agent so i mean yeah it's ridiculous wasn't feasible i've heard the guy in the sewer  i've heard that there was a guy that was another great one that there was a guy actually in the  sewer on the plaza yeah umbrella man all right umbrella man he's a signal oh absolutely oh god 
[03:55:00]  and uh it's just it's silly how they these things catch on and people just they want there to be  what do you what do you think it is that people just want there to be something they can't believe  that one person did this has the power to do that it almost makes you feel a little too vulnerable but  if you go into assassination history you'll find that almost in every case it's one person that  acted alone when you think of that day when you think of being behind that or that moment obviously  what is what is the image that jumps out at you the most is it not the shot is it something on the 
[03:55:30]  back of the car is it a smell of uh exhaust what is it that like you associate with it's the picture  of the president lying in mrs kennedy's lap the right side of his face up his eyes fixed with a  hole in the upper right rear of his head and now i knowing that he was dead wow and you knew that she  knew it and that there was and that's in my embedded in my mind and it just will never leave  after you left the the white house and uh how did how did you deal with was there depression or grief 
[03:56:00]  or or what what what came after i was fine as long as i kept real busy and eventually i was transferred  over to headquarters this is in 1971 or so and given a desk job deputy assistant director for protection  because of that i had a lot of time to think and the assassination just weighed on me day 
[03:56:30]  after day after day and i became very depressed and because of that physically had problems so when i  retired in 1975 i was beginning becoming a real physical wreck then i did a interview with 60 minutes  that fall and then i just went into a deeper depression and i started to drink and i secluded  myself in my home in my basement with lots of scotch and a lot of cigarettes and i lived down like that 
[03:57:00]  for seven years cut myself off from all my friends and associates they'd come by and i wouldn't even  acknowledge them hardly finally a doctor a friend of mine said you have a choice live or die  you either quit what you're doing or you're going to die soon so i quit cold turkey wow and i  eventually recovered by 1990 i went back to dallas to walk the area of dealey plaza to go up in the 
[03:57:30]  sixth floor depository and see from the shooter's advantage point what it looked like and i came away  with the conclusion that well he had all the advantages that day we didn't have any and because  of that and the configuration of everything the angle of the street because elm street  runs away from the building gives him a really a great shot from the right to the back and he was  only about maybe 100 120 feet away it's not going side to side either you got a pretty much virtually a 
[03:58:00]  stationary target if you ever go there you're going to say to yourself i didn't realize it was  this short a distance yeah i've been close yeah we went we've seen it and how did it feel being  back to just walking on that plaza and seeing it it was very emotional at first and that was the  first time i was back there and then i went back there again in 2010 we had a reunion about the agents  who were still living and had been there and uh we all got together for the first time and discussed it 
[03:58:30]  we had never talked about it before among ourselves or with our families wow and so for  the first time after 47 years later we talked about it and how was that very emotional and discovery  channel did a uh special on it on you guys all discussing it and they interviewed each of us  and it's uh rather emotional oh yeah and the driver was uh so most of those guys are still living  or all of them it's only about 17 of us left how many were there originally 34 on the president's 
[03:59:00]  detail two with first lady and three with the two children and it's really the depressing thing is  too that the kennedys all died young i mean i mean even jacklyn kennedy was 64 but that's not old  compared to not today compared to days yeah and and and john jr uh very young it's just a tragic tragic  family i mean it seems like the kennedys have all this mystique around them and they were this  blessed family but there's been a lot of tragedy well i mean there were some before the president 
[03:59:30]  i mean his brother joe was killed in the world war ii his sister uh kick they called her kathleen  was killed and uh so the entire family had didn't they have a son passed away as well  um jfk and uh joe oh who was uh was that uh patrick that died or well that was uh president mrs kennedy's  son yeah yeah he died in 1962 he was born on august 7th and died on august 9th wow geez yeah a lot 
[04:00:00]  of tragedy there unbelievable the book is amazing the book is called i'm sorry i babble so much  the book is so fascinating it's called uh mrs kennedy and me and there's a great shot of you guys  profile on the cover she's like in a sailing outfit she looks really beautiful and you look  like you're listening to whatever she's telling you and uh can i one final question it seems like  you got your life back together in 1990 right more or less so what what have you been doing  since 1990 well i did a little bit of uh consulting work with uh various people and then uh started to 
[04:00:30]  work on this book on on the book for a previous book called the kennedy detail right which was written  by a former agent friend of mine and lisa mccubbin who wrote my book this book we call it our book  because she's the one that really wrote it well you still dictated to her what happened i mean  well i told her things and she wrote it down yeah that's fine i like quinn hill he's all right man 
[04:01:00]  what a secret keeper too what a secret keeper i mean you guys i mean that in a positive way you  didn't you guys didn't discuss it i mean these men back then were different like i'm a such a  fucking emotional boob these guys back then were just rocks and you know he knows stuff that he'll  never tell of course we're not even going to try to get it out of you we know wouldn't be a secret  if i don't but we know i can look in his eyes and know he's just one of those guys he'll never give  up uh some stuff that's why i couldn't do what he does besides the whole man factor and jumping in  front of something which i wouldn't be willing to do uh in in hindsight in hindsight when you when 
[04:01:30]  you look back at what you went through it obviously was post-traumatic stress oh yeah uh would you  have been open to the type of help that's available now or or would you back then have  considered that almost weak to i think we probably would have considered weak and it wasn't available  to us right yeah yeah and we didn't have anybody to replace it so we could have done that anyway  but uh we probably would have all felt that we were stronger than that we shouldn't have to do that  and when you got together and spoke with uh the other agents did you all have that in common that 
[04:02:00]  kind of depression and the the what is post-traumatic stress everybody had the same thing  wow and uh was it was it kind of uh did it make you feel better realizing that everybody else was  going through the same thing well yes and it just made us feel better just talking about it right  getting it out and uh i think the one thing we all would have to tell you is that the best thing  could have been is if we would have counseling a little or or maybe even just talked about it  a little earlier among ourselves amongst yourselves yeah would have been beneficial 
[04:02:30]  yeah commiserate a little bit yeah wow amazing good fascinating great i don't know exactly how old  you are but i'm 80 years old wow has to do something right wow by the way you can order you can order  the book uh through our facebook page opian anthony it's nice to know also you could spend seven  years drinking and smoking and still maybe squeak out 80 i don't recommend it that is the most  encouraging part though is if you want to lock yourself in your basement you'll have a few years 
[04:03:00]  you know you got to stop eventually but have yourself a little party but you're a fascinating  guy and it uh it does put a completely human element to something that people are so detached from and  seeing it and you know in film clips and and sound bites uh but the human element you saw this  and you're conveying a story is is amazing really is can i say one last question is what what did what  happen the first time you actually saw the zapruder film hmm well i was really surprised at what i did 
[04:03:30]  see uh because i you know i had no idea what it looked like how long after did you see i didn't see  that until sometime in 1964 oh you saw it before the public did then that was okay well yeah i would  think so yeah because uh the secret service did get the film and uh and then it appeared in there's  parts of it appeared in life because they sold it to like man not the secret service the yeah  superman's brother yeah yeah i think yeah it was like five years before the public actually saw it 
[04:04:00]  in that uh yeah in the clay uh shot trial i think was the first time it was oh really i'm guessing i  remember all right well thank you so much yeah absolutely thanks so much for coming in well thank you  gentlemen the worst of opie and anthony presents red white and boo  more must hear military moments coming up  it's memorial day and you're listening to red white and boo  here's your host a guy who actually gained weight in iraq robert kelly excuse me i have gird

[04:13:00]  works some movies the cross doesn't work the cross yeah it doesn't work for a werewolf i said on  vampires they change it up they could change it up for a silver bullet right yeah maybe it's not  silver maybe it's platinum it's the faith behind the cross that works as was pointed out in salem's  lot oh right it has nothing to do with just the cross priest was holding the cross up  and it was it was glowing not not if it's finished you're right i apologize your ears distracted me 
[04:13:30]  and he was holding it up and it started fading because the priest was a drunk and he just took  it out of the priest's hand and crushed it and he said it's your faith behind the cross that makes it  strong all right but that's not his logic i'm just a boy that's not a captain vampire though like a  number one vampire you didn't see your werewolf in iraq and and it's not bigfoot on mars i didn't say  it was bigfoot i said it might be it's a dumb shadow it's a see the bigfoot or nessie it's the worst  of the opium anthony show you know me and colin fought once in iraq really legitimately when you beat
