<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often veering wildly off-tangent.  The show heavily featured Jim Norton, both in discussion and as an in-studio guest.  The initial segments focused on Norton's recent appearance on Jay Leno's talk show, praising his performance, particularly a sketch involving "Stalker Patty" and a "WoW" sticker, while criticizing negative reviews from *Entertainment Weekly*.  Norton's subsequent in-studio appearance detailed his experience on Leno, including a near-injury from a spinning stage prop, a disappointing rehearsal, and Leno's help in improving the performance.  He recounted meeting Ozzy and Sharon Osbourne, leading to an impromptu onstage appearance with Ozzy, and attending a Kevin Smith movie screening.  The hosts and Norton discussed the inclusion of the word "cunt" in the Leno segment.  Norton also shared stories from his Los Angeles trip, including encounters with Michael Moore, Ace Frehley, and an uncomfortable backstage moment with Ron Jeremy. A photo of Norton with various celebrities at an Aussie tribute show was also shown.  Listener calls reacting to Norton's Leno appearance and criticism of the Opie and Anthony show's focus on his success were addressed.

A significant portion of the broadcast centered on President Obama calling Kanye West a "jackass," prompting crude and offensive commentary from the hosts.  The Kanye West/Taylor Swift VMA incident was dissected, speculating on whether it was staged, and debating whether Swift should thank Kanye for the publicity.  Taylor Swift's upcoming appearance on the show the following day was announced.

The show also featured tangents: a Photoshopped image of Norton with Ozzy Osbourne, his ex-girlfriend, and Susan Boyle; a bad barbecue at Stuttering John's house; Jessica Simpson's dog being taken by a coyote; Jimmy Carter's comments on racial motivations behind anti-Obama sentiment; and a Yankee's game bench-clearing brawl.  Hal "Fez" Whatley from the Ron and Fez show made an unexpected in-studio appearance dressed as an overweight Hitler, promoting their live show, leading to a discussion about the costume's appropriateness.

A segment heavily criticized a female radio co-host, Amelia, for her appearance and perceived lack of contribution to her show.  The hosts discussed a Sirius XM promo they created, "The Manhole," featuring women mimicking a men's locker room radio style.  Stephen King's column criticizing the Opie and Anthony Show, including discussions of King's radio stations, was also addressed. A video of a white student being beaten on a school bus by black students prompted a heated discussion about racial double standards in media reporting, with numerous callers sharing their opinions and experiences, generating frequent use of offensive language.

A substantial portion of the show was dedicated to sexually explicit conversations, including graphic descriptions of genitalia, sexual acts, and bodily functions.  Norton shared anecdotes about his past employment at Caldor, emphasizing vulgar descriptions of sexual encounters.  Perez Hilton's celebrity gossip, focusing on Lady Gaga's outfits, Kanye West, Taylor Swift, and the Kardashians, was discussed, along with attempts to elicit reactions from passersby ("Morning Mashup"). A radio prank gone wrong in Australia and a potentially censored McDonald's bit were also mentioned.  Other topics included Opie's near-altercation with his agent, Jonathan's prominent groin bulge, criticism of a female host on the "Morning Mashup" show, and a dark and humorous tribute to Patrick Swayze. Chris (Long Island) called in with his own Caldor-related sexual encounter story.  John Valby's song parodying "The Edmund Fitzgerald" and a song by John Sakata were played. B-Rock's shirt also sparked humorous commentary.

Finally, a segment focused on recurring comedic bits, including parodies of Dickie Goodman songs and a poorly received Superman parody song by Kenny.  A Perez Hilton clip discussing Lady Gaga’s VMA performance was shown, leading to a discussion about Lady Gaga's success and the appearance of someone named Nicole.  The hosts discussed a video of a little person in a self-defense class, using offensive terms to describe little people, and planned a street prank involving circus music. Chuck Love called in to volunteer for this prank.  The show concluded with a chaotic live read for Guinness and an unprofessional sign-off.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Well, thank you, Jay Leno.  Thank you very much, Jay Leno.  We can start playing that clip again, now that Jay Leno's back on TV where he belongs.  And he's the most popular late-night TV talk show host, Anthony.  Apparently so.  Apparently. Goddamn, 18 million people watched the debut of Jay Leno's new talk show.  That's a lot of people.  Now, you've got to admit Kanye West people came to watch to see what he was going to do. 
[00:00:30]  But I still think this Jay Leno show has got major potential.  I think it's going to become the thing to watch your late-night TV at 10 o'clock.  10 o'clock. What else is on? Jesus.  And Jim Norton was on last night, and let me be the first to say this.  Say goodbye to Jim Norton.  You'd think that's it?  Yeah, absolutely.  I mean, he'll always be part of this show.  He'll always want to do this show, but he just took a major step forward last night.  Yes.  For some reason, when Jim Norton and the rest of the guys do stand-up on late-night talk shows, 
[00:01:00]  you don't really get the exposure, but you don't get the respect for some reason.  Yep.  They go back to playing the chuckle hut in Name City here.  Yep.  But now that Jimmy's doing sketch comedy on Jay Leno's late-night talk show...  Pretty huge.  It's over. It's definitely different than just going...  And I don't want to downplay it, certainly, but it's different than going out and doing the stand-up. 
[00:01:30]  I can only hope they pay him shit so that he needs this job like we do.  But then we've got to stop paying him shit.  Oh, well, no.  We can pay him shit.  See, two shits make a not-too-shitty.  But Jimmy just killed last night.  He just landed from L.A., and he's going to be on the show, the second half of the show this morning.  Oh!  Well, maybe even sooner.  He's our guest comic for the day, sitting in for Jim Norton.  Yeah, exactly.  Is Jim Norton. 
[00:02:00]  Jim Norton will be, yeah, our guest today.  That's what it's going to turn out to be.  I know.  And then we'll have to go through his people, and they won't book him.  He'll do other shows around here, and they'll have an entourage, and we'll be like, oh, can we get Jim Norton?  They'll be like, hey, hey, leave the talent alone in the hallways.  Don't go like a vulture trying to get the guests.  Yeah.  He's busy.  He's got an image.  Yeah, yeah.  Jimmy's got an image.  He can't really do your show anymore.  Yeah, the NBC people are going to get to him and go, look, man, you've got an image now. 
[00:02:30]  Yeah, Jimmy really likes you.  He's going to give you more and more skits on the show and more things to do on his show.  And, you know, Opie and Anthony kind of have a reputation.  All right.  Right.  That's what he said.  All right.  So you're going to kind of have to stop doing that show.  Yeah.  And that's what we have a press conference and announce.  But Jimmy brought all the filth to our radio show.  Yes.  I guess Howard's real jealous, huh?  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, a lot of people were tweeting me like crazy.  What do you think of Howard trashing Jay Leno's new talk show? 
[00:03:00]  Oh, was he?  Very predictable.  A bit of jealousy.  That's good.  After one episode.  He said that, what did he say, that the ratings won't stay where they are and Jay Leno will fail  and the show will go away in a couple weeks.  All right.  First of all, the ratings for the first night definitely will go away.  They will drop off because a lot of people, you know, are checking it out.  It's something new.  You want to see what it's all about?  So it'll drop a little bit, but I think it's going to stay strong. 
[00:03:30]  I really do.  He's going to be doing something a little different.  He's just mad.  Howard's just mad that Jay said that about us on satellite radio.  He's mad.  It drives him nuts.  He's mad.  I like how little Jimmy had the wow sticker behind him.  Holy shit.  And he had a picture of Patty and a bathing suit.  Yeah.  Stalker Patty and a bathing suit.  Fucking Stalker Patty makes national television for like seven minutes.  And I guess Jimmy met Susan Boyle at the airport, too. 
[00:04:00]  Oh, really?  So he should have a pretty good story about that.  Because we've talked about that monster on our show.  Of course we have.  I bet she was lovely and nice.  Listen, Jimmy's going to become one of those guys that just say everybody was nice.  Oh, become?  Wait a minute.  What?  He's going to become one of those people that just say everyone's nice.  Oh, right.  I go, oh, wait.  Become?  Oh, right.  Jimmy isn't.  Jimmy is the furthest thing from a bridge burner I've ever seen.  He douses bridges with water that aren't even smoldering. 
[00:04:30]  That's how much he does not want to burn a bridge because he's smart.  He knows that perhaps in the future one of these people may be able to help him in his career  so he doesn't shit on them, much like we have on everyone during our career.  Well, what are you going to do?  What are you going to do about that?  Yeah, it's a different road.  It's a different technique.  Right.  We figure let's shit on everyone so that the few people we haven't shit on might also dislike  the people we've shit on and then they'll help us. 
[00:05:00]  Right.  Instead of just not shitting on so many people.  Entertainment Weekly, EW.  This is Trib from Utah.  Oh.  T-R-I-B.  I've never seen that name before.  E-W.  Entertainment Weekly really doesn't like you guys.  And then he quotes something that EW wrote.  It says,  In which the stand-up comic sits down and tells lame jokes,  whose punchlines are illustrated with photos,  so we'll be sure to get it. 
[00:05:30]  Is that the same publication where Stephen King said we can be put where the sun doesn't shine?  Yeah.  Oh.  Seattle?  Ha ha ha ha ha ha.  See, because it's always overcast there and depressing.  I get it.  Entertainment Weekly, yeah, definitely doesn't like the show because Jim Norton killed.  He absolutely killed last night.  Yeah.  His material was great, and then he's punching it up with pictures.  It was perfect.  Yeah.  It was absolutely perfect. 
[00:06:00]  Anthony, Natalie Shannon from Pittsburgh doesn't like us.  What?  I love coming in here, and you get to see, like, the instant feedback that comes in in the middle of the night when no one's here.  That makes sense.  These psychopaths just typing away.  Ha ha ha ha ha.  Just typing away.  Ha ha ha ha ha.  And honestly, in most cases, we never see it because we just refresh the instant feedback.  Oh, so you're taking a little gander?  So, for some reason, it's here today.  3.11 a.m.  Who the fuck is here at 3.11 a.m. to read your stupid instant feedback?  Damn. 
[00:06:30]  Natalie Shannon from Pittsburgh writes,  You, O.P. and Anthony fans, need to quit personally attacking Stephen King and his wife.  Ha ha ha ha.  You guys are sick in what you said.  Stephen King has a right to his own opinion without being personally attacked.  Wishing he was dead and attacking his wife?  He never wished he was dead.  I never said that.  I just said, I have a right to my opinion, too.  I think the minivan was probably very damaged in the collision with the gentleman. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah.  Yes.  And I said that he married a pig.  Then Natalie Shannon continues,  You, O.P. and Anthony fans, are sick puppies.  I hope you all, and it's in capital, so let me say it this way.  Rot in hell.  Oh, wow.  She's angry at 3.11 in the morning.  Right.  What is this?  Is that like a drunken text?  Probably.  What do you got there, Sam?  That's a quote that they were just talking about on Feedback.  There's two.  That's what Entertainment Weekly posted this morning. 
[00:07:30]  That's in the review of Jay Leno's show.  Leno's post-monologue segment was given over to Jim Norton, Uninvited Guest,  in which the stand-up comic sits down and tells lame jokes whose punchlines are illustrated with photos,  so we'll be sure to get it.  I'd have been insulted if I wasn't so bored.  I'd have been insulted if I wasn't.  After the ratings blowout of his opening night, plus Kanye, I'm really curious to see the stats on this one. 
[00:08:00]  I want to see the ratings breakdowns by segments and how far they fell, starting with Jim Norton's comedy bit.  Go fuck yourself.  Someone doesn't like Jimmy.  Somebody doesn't like Jimmy, and somebody doesn't like the O.P. and Anthony show.  Aw, what's the matter?  Shut up, you fucking celebrity rag magazine.  My Twitter blew up after Norton's appearance.  People were like, holy shit, Jimmy was on and knocked it out of the park.  This is what Jimmy's going to have to deal with. 
[00:08:30]  You know what also is...  With his newfound fame of his.  You know what's also great?  It says, illustrated with photos, so we'll be sure to, and then in quotation marks, it says, get it.  Right.  Jimmy even made fun of that in one of the segments where they showed him with the big thing of hand cream.  Right.  And he looked in the camera and went, get it?  Because that's like one of his jokes.  That's what...  So, like, somebody doesn't understand.  Someone doesn't understand.  You don't get it.  You don't get it.  Right.  Once again, someone not understanding sarcasm. 
[00:09:00]  Right.  Jimmy went, get it?  Like he tells the joke.  He wasn't saying get it, meaning do you get it?  It's like, get it like it's over the top.  Right.  Yes, I get it.  Look how ridiculous this is.  It is to illustrate it.  So she actually...  Yeah.  It has to be a she.  It has to be.  Is it a she?  No.  That's a guy.  Might as well be.  Ken Tucker.  Oh, Ken, it's got to be one of these guys.  Oh, I didn't do nothing. 
[00:09:30]  Oh, ho, ho.  Well, is there any...  Ken Tucker.  Oh, ho.  Well, we got to fight for Jimmy.  Any place the fans could go to comment about Jim Norton's section?  He's got a blog.  He's got a blog.  Everyone has a blog, Sam.  Fuck the blog.  Everyone has a dumb blog.  But it looks like he can leave responses on his blog.  All right.  Where do they go?  Kentucker.net.  Who's got kentucker.com? 
[00:10:00]  Ken Tucker?  Kentucker.net.  That's right.  That's him?  Well, he's got a pop culture blog.  Well, then it's got to be.  Unless there's two Ken Tucker pop culture writers.  Well, you know what?  I guess he knows a thing or two about pop culture.  He knows nothing about pop culture.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, he looks relevant.  Fuck.  Go for it.  Oh, my God.  How would he know about pop culture?  Look at him.  How does he know what actual people in the demo want to see? 
[00:10:30]  Look at him.  I can't even describe this guy.  I'm trying to come up with something.  Yeah, I'm trying to, like, say who he looks like or what, but...  He doesn't have much hair.  No, it's the horseshoe bald.  He's got horrendous glasses.  Giant.  And he looks extremely dehydrated.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, he just...  Oh.  Looks like every...  Everyone's dad.  Like, he could be cast as a father in any teen movie. 
[00:11:00]  The curmudgeonly dad.  Screw him.  I heard Jay Leno was very happy with Jimmy's performance.  Everybody was happy.  But, you know, there'll be people out there trying to knock you down.  Haters, yo.  A lot of haters.  Yeah, there's a lot of haters in this world, Ant.  Yes.  All right.  So, Jimmy will be here in about an hour, and we'll get into the whole Leno thing with him. 
[00:11:30]  That's for sure.  What else is going on?  Oh, my God.  You see the president having a real moment?  A real calculated moment?  You think it was calculated?  I think it was.  I think the president knows when his mic is...  You know, when his mic is...  Well, they're playing it off like you didn't know, Ant.  It makes him sound like a regular kind of guy.  Which is what he wants to come across as.  Uh-huh.  And, you know, I think I would have believed it more if he said asshole instead of jackass. 
[00:12:00]  But it's good.  It sounds like a real moment.  I'll give him the benefit of the doubt.  Well, Obama calls Kanye West a jackass off the record at a news conference.  Off the record?  Yeah, he was getting ready for a news conference, and I guess he just assumed that no one pushed record yet.  Yeah, exactly.  I think I'm kind of with Anthony.  Yeah.  I think if you're the president and you're anywhere near a public situation, you've got to assume there's a microphone on.  The Soviet Union has been deemed illegal. 
[00:12:30]  The bombing starts in five minutes.  Remember that one?  Yeah.  That was a good one.  Of course.  That was a great one.  Here's Obama talking about Kanye West.  It's all about Kanye.  Were your girls as hacked off as mine were that Kanye gave Taylor Swift the Joe Wilson treatment?  I thought that was really inappropriate.  That sounds like the start of a press conference.  Yeah, yeah.  Question, answer.  Right.  There's a question, and he's answering it.  They're just warming up.  Huh?  I think they're just warming up.  Warming up.  I'm with Ann.  Obama knew damn well this mic was on. 
[00:13:00]  Come on.  The Joe Wilson treatment?  I thought that was really inappropriate.  You know?  I mean, it's like she's getting an award.  What are you butting in?  I hear you.  I agree with you.  I don't buy...  Joe, does that count as the first question?  Patty hurt.  John's hair.  The young lady seems like a perfectly nice person.  She's getting her award.  What's he doing up there?  Why would he do that?  He's a jackass.  No, no.  All this stuff... 
[00:13:30]  That's what Pink said.  I'm assuming all this stuff.  That's not what Pink said.  That's what Pink said.  Oh, my God.  You're just like Pink.  You're just like Pink.  No, that's not what Pink said.  I think she called him a piece of shit.  Yes.  A little different.  That would have been good.  Oh, my God.  That's what Pink said.  That I would have believed.  Oh, they're just so giddy.  Somebody pointed out, oh, the hole.  She's the hole of the press conference.  I love that you guys understand the concept of the hole. 
[00:14:00]  That makes me so fucking happy.  The hole.  A lot of women walking around yesterday just giving us dirty looks.  Look, there are women here at SiriusXM.  They do a very good job.  Oh, yeah.  I don't think there's a radio show here that has the typical hole.  I really don't.  Let me think.  Like Nicole from Morning Mashup, she's not a hole.  She holds her own, and it's a pop format, and she does a very good job.  Different type of hole, I say.  You know what I mean?  You know what I mean? 
[00:14:30]  Nice and raw.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I say there's three of them.  Oh, damn.  Which hole Tuesday.  Oh.  And then you got other women that do, you know, they do real women talk.  Yeah.  Like edgy women talk.  Right.  It's not a woman trying to fit into the locker room mentality. 
[00:15:00]  By, like, knocking them down.  Right.  Stop.  But very good.  So let's listen to the hole again.  That's what Pink said.  Oh, my God.  Pink said.  Trying to relate to the president.  Shut up.  No.  What's he doing up there?  Why would he do that?  He's a jackass.  No, no.  All this stuff.  That's what Pink said.  I'm assuming all this stuff.  Where's the poor?  You know what's funny?  She got no reaction, so you know she's just turning her head all around where she's at.  The Pink, that's where Pink said it. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah, she said it twice.  First time she was stepped on, so she said it again.  Right.  Just to anyone that might listen to her.  Press conference hole.  The press conference hole.  Uh-huh.  All this stuff.  Where's the poor?  Come on, guys.  Cut the president some slack.  I got a lot of other stuff on my plate.  I'll pay you, sir.  No cake.  Yeah, because I remember last time there was the fly thing.  That was the highlight of...  Now, that worked out well for you. 
[00:16:00]  That would.  You were a ninja.  Except PETA.  And Reggie has the fly to release in about seven minutes.  Yeah.  You got the chopsticks this time?  Yeah, right.  It's kind of weird how they all just kind of get along, you know?  Yeah, and then the press conference stars are like, oh, Mr. President, you're an asshole.  Oh, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah.  You're an asshole, Mr. President, and I think your policies stink.  A comment?  Wait a minute.  You were just laughing with me.  Right.  It's kind of refreshing to see them just kind of hang in.  It's professional wrestling. 
[00:16:30]  It's wrestling.  Oh, yeah.  That was backstage at wrestling.  Yeah, they're all getting along.  Let me tell you something, brother.  Yeah, that's true.  I just wish there was...  Oh, my God, the President's having a slumber knocker.  I just wish there were more real moments like that.  Just in society in general, or just in the media, I should say, in general.  Not society.  That's stupid.  But on your local news and whatnot.  Just...  That's refreshing.  That did sound like genuine conversation. 
[00:17:00]  It sounds like they all just kind of hang out and talk a little bit before they get down to business.  Yeah, down and dirty.  With that said, Obama had to think that...  Had to know someone was recording already.  Yeah, because he really didn't slip up that bad.  I thought...  He sounded like a regular guy.  It's something that everyone could agree on.  He was a jackass.  Right.  He didn't use language that was really out of the realm of the presidency.  Mm-hmm.  And it worked out good for him.  Made him look like a regular kind of guy.  Yeah, when I heard about this, I thought Obama was maybe in a hallway or something, walking to the press...  You know what I mean? 
[00:17:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Just a quick aside.  But no, everyone was set up and ready.  Ready to go.  The cameras were ready to roll.  So how does he not know someone's fucking rolling on him?  So, once again, Ed, you're right.  Yeah, I think it was a little calculated.  I prefer Nixon's candid tape moments, though.  Those were, I think, a little better than Obama's.  The Jew.  The Jews.  Did we ever get the one on Ted Kennedy that I asked him?  The Negroes.  Did I ever get the one from Ted Kennedy?  Nixon talking about Ted Kennedy?  Oh, my God.  I don't think so. 
[00:18:00]  Oh, my God.  You guys never found that?  That was an EROC operation, I think.  Oh, come on.  Is there another cover-up?  It was part of that HBO thing, Ted Kennedy in his own words.  And Nixon was recorded when I think George Wallace was shot, when George Wallace was making a run for the presidency, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And he got shot.  Or governor or something.  Or whatever it was.  He got a pretty high office.  And Nixon basically told his boys to get the word out that, you know, it was a Ted Kennedy supporter that shot Wallace. 
[00:18:30]  Yes.  And the guy's like, but...  They'll believe it.  And the one nervous Nellie's like, but, but, Mr. President, we don't know that.  Just get it out there.  Get it out there.  It's just like...  Doesn't matter.  And he's the president.  I'm the president.  They'll believe it.  Put Liddy on it.  He's a sneaky son of a bitch like you.  Where's Niedermeyer?  If Vance can do his Nixon, we need our Rolling Stones music.  That's the only way to do this.  There it is.  There it is.  Back in the 60s. 
[00:19:00]  Well, Mr. President, we don't know that.  I don't care.  The shooter was a Ted Kennedy supporter.  Get Ben Stein on it.  He's a sneaky little shit like you.  He's on double secret probation.  But, Mr. President, this will ruin Ted Kennedy.  Nothing will ruin that fat bastard.  He killed a bitch.  That didn't ruin him.  Just do it.  I'm uncomfortable.  I've got the shingles. 
[00:19:30]  Where's checkers, my dog?  Checkers.  Checkers.  Mr. President, before we start the press conference...  Yes.  Yes.  Check one, two, yes.  What do you think of this Kanye West situation?  Amazing.  Yeah.  My God, what's wrong with that darkie?  I don't get it.  Is this Mike on?  What's wrong with the darkie?  He should leave the little Jew girl alone.  I don't think she was Jewish, Mr. President.  I don't, because she looked like a Jew.  She's in show business.  She's a Jew. 
[00:20:00]  Right.  But we don't know she's Jewish.  Put it out there.  People will believe it.  Right.  Just put it out there.  Everyone will believe it.  Put Liddy on it.  We got to get it, though.  We're fed.  I want to hear that.  It's amazing.  All right.  Speaking of Kanye West, there's a little buzz out there that the whole thing was staged,  because MTV likes to stage things. 
[00:20:30]  And I don't know.  They're trying to get that going.  I don't think.  I don't know.  I don't think that has legs, to be honest with you.  I think that falls into the category of when we do something and people are like, it's  fake.  So fake.  And we're sitting here going, no, that really fucking happened.  And, yeah, I think that's it.  It looked too good to be staged.  Stage shit is so obvious.  And what sold me...  Like the Eminem, remember?  Yeah, yeah.  We were all over the poor Eminem thing.  Fucking fake.  Just stop it.  They can't pull off real that well. 
[00:21:00]  I mean, poor little Taylor Swift.  Her face was...  I mean, if that was fake, drop the microphone, go into movies, because you are quite the little  actress.  She did not know what to do.  She looked like a little fawn, a newly born fawn with fucking jackals around her.  Now, I don't really think entertainment is in the real world, Anthony.  Yeah.  At all?  No.  So, I've been thinking about this. 
[00:21:30]  This Kanye West thing, right?  Kanye.  Everybody's really pissed at Kanye and wants Kanye to apologize to Taylor Swift, which, by  the way, he did not do until Taylor Swift was on The View yesterday.  No.  Like, even before Kanye was on Leno, and after Leno, he still didn't apologize to Taylor  Swift, even though he was breaking down and crying, sort of, on Leno.  He didn't apologize to her on Leno?  He finally apologized, because The View broads, they asked, has he called you yet? 
[00:22:00]  And Taylor goes, no, he hasn't apologized yet.  Oh, directly.  So, right after The View, backstage, Kanye West called her, finally.  But here's my take on this.  I think Taylor Swift should be thanking Kanye West.  For all the publicity.  She got so much more famous, I'm telling you.  And good publicity, yeah.  Yeah.  She is so much more famous than two days ago, three days ago.  The View would not have had her on for winning the best video award.  Hell fucking no. 
[00:22:30]  Yeah.  All these talk shows, radio, TV, no one would be talking about Taylor Swift two days after  the VMAs.  True that, yo.  And because of that, she's definitely selling more units.  She made a lot of money because Kanye West did what he did.  And that's where it gets a little weird and strange.  Yeah.  Like, Taylor Swift should be really grateful that this happened.  Say it was staged.  Put it out there.  It's not easy to be a pop star and continue, you know, putting out hits. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah.  But now that you got this massive publicity behind, like, what Kanye did, it's going to  only help her.  And what do you think it does for Kanye?  It fucks it pretty bad, Anthony.  Does it?  Because I'm thinking the heat is, even just in a couple of days, it seemed to die down.  I think his Leno appearance kind of patched things up with a few people.  Yeah.  With a few, you know, elements of society.  Society?  Society.  He's being made an escape goat. 
[00:23:30]  Yo.  Yeah.  I think it hurts him for a little bit.  Yeah.  He'll be back, though.  Oh, it's not a career ender, that's for sure.  Fuck no.  If we could come back to radio after what we did, I think Kanye West will be making more  hits in the very near future.  His head looks like a game on a placemat.  It's like, you got to take your pencil or your crayon that they give you and get from  like his ear to the other ear. 
[00:24:00]  Over the top of his head.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Through the treacherous trail.  Through the top of his head.  Why does he got Nana's doily on his head?  Yeah, that doesn't look like Nana's doily or...  Like they're over at Nana's having tea and they put the teacup down over the doily.  Or it should slowly...  Is it called a doily?  A doily, yeah.  Yeah.  Or it should slowly zoom into the top of his head so he could see young Danny Torrance  and his mother walking through. 
[00:24:30]  That's got to be a nightmare to keep up.  Yeah, yeah.  Fuck.  What is the hell of a look?  Does he have to re-carve that every day?  I don't know.  Maybe he doesn't do it at all.  Maybe his head's transparent and that's his brain.  It kind of looks brainy, doesn't it?  All swirly and curly.  Like a brain.  Very good.  All right, well, here's Taylor Swift on the view.  Okay, now when that happens, Taylor, what was going through your mind?  Well, I think my overall thought process went something like, 
[00:25:00]  Wow, I can't believe I won.  This is awesome.  Don't trip and fall.  I'm going to get to thank the fans.  This is so cool.  Oh, Kanye West is here.  Cool haircut.  Oh, my God.  Kanye West is here.  Cool haircut.  What are you doing there?  What are you doing there?  And then, ouch, and then, I guess I'm not going to get to thank the fans. 
[00:25:30]  The end.  Yeah.  See, she's not.  You can tell.  She's not broken up.  Nah.  Two days later, she's not broken up about it because she's like,  Wow, look at all the attention I'm getting.  And all her peeps, as they call them.  You know, they call people that hang around you, Sam, peeps.  Really?  Your peeps means like your people.  I'm glad I know that now.  Yeah.  Yeah, we use that.  Was Danny fired?  To use it.  Well, that was Danny fired.  I just realized Danny's not around anymore.  What happened?  We don't bring up Danny right now. 
[00:26:00]  For real?  Aw, shit.  Yeah, I mean.  Aw, shit.  Why are Anthony and I out of the loop all the time?  What happened?  Is he fired or not?  Yes, he is.  Aw, damn.  Taylor says Kanye hasn't called her.  No, he said he came on Jay Leno, and he said he wanted to apologize to you face-to-face.  If he came to you, would you want to meet with him face-to-face?  Sure.  I mean, he has not personally reached out or anything, but if he wanted to say hi.  He hasn't called or sent a message or an email or anything. 
[00:26:30]  He couldn't take a question with him, but he hasn't.  So I can't take a question with him.  Just shut up and meet him.  What the fuck is she saying?  What, Barbara?  Oh, an old stroke mouth. 
[00:27:00]  Wow.  Poof.  Wow, wow, wow, Anthony.  She's a broadcaster.  Is she a broadcaster?  She's a broadcaster.  Taylor Swift, enjoy it.  All these people with her.  My cock.  See, get it?  Because she's really hot and stuff.  Oh, now, Anthony.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Oh.  What do you mean about your fucking...  What? 
[00:27:30]  What?  He has not personally reached out or anything, but if you wanted to say hi.  He hasn't called or sent a message or an email or anything.  She is tripping over her dentures.  Her tongue is tripping over her dentures.  Her dentures are trying to escape her mouth, knowing that it's only a matter of time.  Barbara sounds like Leonard.  Oh, please don't bring up Leonard. 
[00:28:00]  No, no.  Oh, boy.  Let's not.  We don't know what you're talking about when you say Leonard.  Ixnay on the Ennard lay.  Mm-hmm.  Yep.  Another bit you'll never hear from ever again.  I hope you have a copy of it.  Hope you liked it.  That's a rare one.  Mm.  Start collecting the rare bits.  New.  He hasn't called or sent a message or an email or anything?  No.  Wow.  But do you feel hard feelings about it, Taylor, or not?  You know, I'm not going to say that I wasn't rattled by it, but I had to perform live five 
[00:28:30]  minutes later, so I had to get myself back to the place where I could perform.  Yeah.  But you're a pro, and you did it.  Thank you.  How did you feel it today?  I'm just applauding along with the view crowd, because I have a vagina.  We're a fucked up country, man.  People out there losing their jobs, working two jobs to make ends meet, and we're all  feeling sorry for a multi-millionaire, 19-year-old piece of ass. 
[00:29:00]  Millionaire-us.  Millionaire-us, right, yeah.  We are fucked up, man.  You know why?  Because she's it.  She is it.  Show me that picture.  Yeah, give me a hot fucking...  Look at that shit.  That's her?  Dude.  She didn't look that good on the VMAs, man.  I think she's my new favorite.  She's dreamy.  I think she...  Yeah, she's stepping up a few notches.  See, that's why she should thank Kanye.  Yeah, I never would have really acknowledged the fact of how gorgeous she is, and gotten 
[00:29:30]  creepy stalking her.  But now, she's got that to look forward to.  Can we get her on our show?  Yeah, that'd be good.  Yeah, tomorrow.  Oh, really?  Tomorrow?  Cool.  Taylor Swift's going to be on the show tomorrow?  Tomorrow.  Holy shit.  Tune in.  Everyone get the word out.  Taylor Swift will be on the Opie and Anthony show tomorrow.  Tune in.  I didn't know that.  Could you guys please pass the word out there to the mainstream media?  Taylor Swift will be on the Opie and Anthony show tomorrow.  That's fucking huge. 
[00:30:00]  Mediocre Gatsby is assuming that because I like the way this girl looks, that Dakota  Fanning has slipped to second place now.  They're about the same age now.  Are they?  How old is Dakota?  Taylor Swift is 19, and Dakota, I think, is pushing 15 or 16 at this point.  Is she really?  I think.  Why don't you look up Dakota Fanning's age?  Remember when it was about the Olsen twins?  Now they're old.  Turning 18.  And now it's like...  22 now?  Now they're just little fucking alien-looking creatures that walk around and... 
[00:30:30]  They're not...  They're not...  They're not that pretty.  No.  Something happened.  Well, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.  Yes, Barbara?  Oh, she's kind of looking a little weird.  19.  How do we get the word out?  Now, how old is Dakota Fanning?  Four.  Four.  Fifteen?  What's the matter?  Just give me the year she was born.  I'm a math whiz.  If you say 19 or 15...  Ladies, 15.  That's a big difference in everyone's life.  Ninety-four.  Ninety-four. 
[00:31:00]  Ninety-four.  Prison or no prison.  Ninety-four?  All right, so she's, yeah, 15.  Okay.  Fifteen and a half, Sam.  All right.  You got two and a half years, then.  Until she's, uh...  Legal.  Depending on what state.  We learned that from you, Ant.  Eighteen's good.  Actually, wait a minute.  Fifteen, six, six, eight.  Yeah.  It'll be like two years.  Isn't she legal in Rhode Island?  A year and a half.  Fifteen going on 16.  All right.  Well...  Damn.  What happened?  It was just a little kid.  What happened? 
[00:31:30]  Oh, they grow up so fast.  And one more clip from The View.  Everyone very concerned about Taylor Swift, making sure she's doing okay.  Oh, yes.  As the world talks about her.  So important.  As people are just lining up to get Taylor Swift stuff.  Yeah.  Taylor Swift stuff.  She's going to be on our show tomorrow, and the interview's going to be a lot tougher, Sam.  Yes.  We're not going to do what The View broads did, trust me.  We're going to have hard-hitting questions.  Mm-hmm.  So, where did you find the strength to perform after that? 
[00:32:00]  Because that had to be hard.  Well, you know, there were a lot of people around me backstage that were saying wonderful, incredible things.  And just having my back.  I've got to keep stopping this.  This is driving me nuts now.  Yeah.  When it went down, everyone's reaction was, Kanye West is a complete asshole.  Yes.  But you've got to see the other side of this.  This is huge for any celebrity.  But, you know, you could see the phony Hollywood music people backstage just going,  Oh, girl, you just go up there. 
[00:32:30]  And you know what?  You get back just by getting up there and doing the best performance you can.  She said that they told her, like in another interview, Taylor Swift said that they told her to be ready just in case Beyonce said something.  So, when Beyonce called her up for a spontaneous moment.  Stop it.  She's backstage ready just in case.  Really?  Oh, fuck it.  Come on.  Well, here's the rest of the, uh...  Around me backstage that were saying wonderful, incredible things and just having my back. 
[00:33:00]  And all the other artists that came and showed me love, you know, in the hours following it and all the people tweeting about it and all the fans.  And I just never imagined that there were that many people out there looking out for me.  So, it was really wonderful to see that people were out there defending me so I didn't have to.  Oh.  If Kanye is watching, he'll know what to do.  You know something?  Fucking Whoopi annoys the living piss out of me. 
[00:33:30]  Why?  Wait, wait.  Let me try to do it.  Hopefully, if Kanye is watching, he'll know what to do.  She's got this smugness that she doesn't deserve to have.  Ah.  I don't mind her.  No, I don't like this.  I really don't mind her.  I hate her on that.  I hate her on the view.  I don't mind her.  Stop it with her fucking predator hair.  I hate it.  And her lack of eyebrows.  Does she shave them? 
[00:34:00]  Did they not grow in?  What is it?  Is she having eyelid chemo?  Why the fuck does she have no eyebrows?  They were rubbed off because she licks a lot of pussy.  Was that it?  I thought they were left on Ted Danson's lower abdomen.  I don't know what she licks.  I shouldn't have said pussy because who knows?  Who knows what Whoopi's into?  Ladies and gentlemen, Jim Norton in his sweatpants.  Jim Norton has just entered in his airplane attire.  Yes.  That's his flying attire.  That's the only way to fly is sweatpants and a comfy t-shirt. 
[00:34:30]  So you can pitch a tent when the sexy stew comes by.  No, you show the foreign gentleman next to you.  He looks over and he can see you have a leaky rod.  Leaky rod.  You can sleep on a plane if you've got sweats on.  I didn't sleep at all.  I was up.  Well, you shouldn't have slept, Jimmy.  It's very exciting.  I just couldn't.  I drank caffeine and shit.  I'm fucking tired.  You got tired, Jimmy, today.  Oh, cool.  Oh, boy.  Lucky us.  Leto gets chipper wide awake, Jimmy, and we get tired, Jimmy.  We get tired, Jimmy.  Leto gets awake, Jimmy, and you get onion balls. 
[00:35:00]  Great.  We'll take the good with the bad.  Jimmy, you fucking killed last night, man.  Thanks, man.  That was a fucking loop.  And I said it right off the bat.  That's a giant step for you, career-wise.  Giant step.  I don't know why, but I was telling Anthony, when you and other comedians do a late-night  talk show and you do your stand-up, it's amazing.  It's great, right?  But for some reason, you don't get the same respect if you're doing a skit or something  else for a late-night talk show. 
[00:35:30]  And now that you are doing, like, you did that skit, it is giant.  You've done Leno, what, six, seven times?  Seven tonight, sir.  But it just feels different because of what was on TV last night.  I mean, they built a set for you and whatnot.  I love the WoW sticker and the Patty picture.  Are you so good?  Oh, yeah.  I saw it.  I haven't seen it because I left her.  The WoW sticker was right over your left shoulder.  Okay.  Was it horizontal?  Because she had put it up, down.  No, no, no. 
[00:36:00]  And I'm like, could you straighten that?  And she goes, well, I don't know if they'll let me because it's a logo.  And I'm like, oh, okay, let me just, because I was going to make a homemade one if we had  to.  But then she, I think she's...  It's not really a logo.  My brother scribbled that out.  In between his darkness.  Yeah.  It was really fucking good.  Oh, thanks, man.  I have yet to see it.  It was funny.  And the, I like when you went, get it?  Oh, I have to see it.  The fucking hand tub.  Well, a critic didn't get it because that's what they wrote was, get it.  And me and Aunt were like, that was sarcasm, you dumb fuck. 
[00:36:30]  Yeah, of course it was.  You dumb fuck.  Wait, did somebody, did somebody really think that I meant that?  No.  Can you, I don't want to...  It's just, well, some people don't understand the critics.  Well, it's Entertainment Weekly.  This guy writes a blog, a pop culture blog.  Oh, of course, a blog.  And he, here it is.  But I want to, I don't want to bring it down, Jimmy.  It's not.  All right, good.  Because you fucking killed.  Everyone knows you killed.  It was an amazing segment.  What is some fucking douchey blogger? 
[00:37:00]  It's like, of course.  Well, it's Entertainment Weekly.  Fuck them.  Who cares?  And it's more that the guy just doesn't get comedy.  Comedy.  Comedy.  Comedy.  Oh, damn, yo.  See, we missed Danny at this point.  Damn, yo.  The computer froze a minute ago.  Danny would unfreeze it.  I unfroze it.  Jayla, all right.  How much longer is this going to be?  Oh, crap.  Oh, you...  That's not, that's not the right one.  Sam's panicking.  Hey, you know what?  I'm sure Danny is somewhere going, see? 
[00:37:30]  See?  I know how to do this.  Yeah, and by the way, Mark in Jersey,  Taylor Swift's performance was pre-recorded.  Was she lip-syncing?  Well, because she's saying of you,  and five minutes later had to perform live.  That didn't seem like it was a live performance.  Five minutes later, I had to watch a video myself.  So, uh...  Mark's the guy that doesn't like...  Was he really that bored?  He's just some fucking...  Well, yeah, let me read it again. 
[00:38:00]  It's ridiculous, Jimmy, and I'm...  If this brings you down, I don't know what to tell you,  because this is just ridiculous.  You shouldn't let these people get to you.  There's going to be many of them.  Yeah, well, and there's going to be many people loving it, so...  Leno's post-monologue segment was given over to Jim Norton,  Uninvited Guest,  in which the stand-up comic sits down  and tells lame jokes  whose punchlines are illustrated with photos,  so we'll be sure to get it.  I'd have been insulted if I wasn't so bored.  Were you really bored?  And would you have really been insulted?  Insulted.  Why would you have been insulted? 
[00:38:30]  Insulted.  Was it the Megan's Law reference  that you were being insulted by  or the fucking...  or the big cum buckets that I was carrying?  Shut up, you fucking douchey blogger.  Who cares?  What does it say on the cum bucket going solo?  Yeah, going...  Oh, I didn't even read it.  I don't know.  It was fucking...  I took the picture, but I did not read it.  It was a big tub,  and it said,  Go in solo.  It wasn't a G on there.  It was a big tub of lube  and it says going solo on the side.  Going solo.  See, there's the set.  The WoW sticker was right over your left shoulder.  Let me see that picture. 
[00:39:00]  You're going to get a lot of these fucking snarky...  It comes with it.  But he had a quote when you said,  Get it,  and proven that he didn't get it  because you said get it.  Because you were being sarcastic about it.  You were being sarcastic,  not like,  Oh, please get what I'm doing here.  Because it's so over the top.  Right.  Like, fucking asshole.  But that's...  Entertainment Weekly is never going to like me.  Any of these guys...  Do you like Stephen King?  I know what happened with him.  I respect him as a writer,  but who gives a fuck what he thinks?  For real.  Who gives a fuck?  We should be where the sun don't shine, Jimmy. 
[00:39:30]  Really?  Where the sun don't shine.  Why don't you just say up your asshole  like you would in one of your books, Stephen?  Yeah, I know.  Who gives a fuck?  Yeah.  He's a brilliant writer,  but as a guy,  who gives a shit?  Who cares?  It's like fucking Janet Reno.  Fuck him.  And I'm trying to...  I had a picture of Ozzie and Sharon  that was above...  Oh, yeah.  Up too high, I think.  Let's put it lower.  Oh, good.  You can see Patty.  I know what.  There was actually a wow sticker  above Patty, too.  What's the picture above the wow sticker?  They just...  That was like somebody  who used to do something with them. 
[00:40:00]  That was him as a kid.  They just decorate.  I got to bring in stuff.  All right.  Are you going to have a desk like that?  Every time?  That's the set, yeah.  So when you're on Jay Leno,  it's going to be that set?  If unless...  The next segment I'm doing,  I think, is some kind of like a panel thing  where we are just talking about topics of the day.  If I do another one of those,  it'll be with that set.  Right on.  But I'll add to it.  That is awesome.  Some people are commenting,  you are the new Andy Rooney.  Oh!  You sit there. 
[00:40:30]  You ever know?  Are we going to be watching this 30 years from now?  Yeah.  Busted on Jimmy.  I tell you.  I'm using jerk-off lotion.  Did you ever make a pedophile joke at 10.07?  I know.  That's why Leno's fucking cool.  But it's really funny.  The material, I'm like,  holy shit, this is 10 o'clock.  Right on.  It's funny how the critics are attacking Leno,  which I knew that was going to happen  because they attacked him  when he was at The Tonight Show.  I never heard of his ratings.  It's like they're saying things like,  well, with the coarse humor 
[00:41:00]  or something like that,  like one guy,  I like Jim Norton,  but he's going to do the humorous course.  It's like if Leno wasn't there,  you fucking asshole,  it'd be a drama  that opens every week  with a fucking dead body.  What are you talking about?  Well, Frank.  Yeah, exactly.  Or, yeah,  it would be a pedophile storyline  or something.  It's some stupid, corny drama.  Enough with networks  and their stupid dramas.  HBO and Showtime kill them.  They're better.  Yeah, but so far so good  for The Leno Show.  Yeah, I...  So far so good. 
[00:41:30]  The first night I did not watch  because let's just say  I was having a semen removed from me  by force.  By force.  For a thing.  Let's say...  All right,  ixnay on that stuff, Jim.  Yeah, I had to...  You're becoming a big star.  You can't be telling people  that your semen is being forced  out of your body.  It was being removed angrily  and reluctantly by someone  for a pittance of cash.  Angrily.  They're listening now, Jim.  And I were saying that 
[00:42:00]  Leno's people are going to come  to you eventually  because you're going to be  a big star now, Jimmy.  It's very obvious.  A big star.  It's very obvious.  Not to take away from the first comic  that did a skit,  but yours blew his away.  I didn't...  Oh, Dan Band?  I didn't see...  And I'm a fan of his.  I like his stuff,  but your bit was...  Your sketch or...  What is it called?  I don't know.  It's like a...  They called it  Jim Norton Uninvited Guest.  Yeah.  All right.  Was...  Yeah, it was just...  But you were invited.  There is something ironic there  that I was going to say. 
[00:42:30]  I was just going to start screaming  like the fucking guy in Network  about how I was invited.  I was.  Just ruined the segment  like Cheswick.  Right.  No Cheswick.  No Cheswick.  It's called Uninvited.  But I was invited.  Jay saved me, though,  because I had worked this material  out so many times  in the clubs  and I got to a rehearsal  in front of a small audience  like when I went out there  last time.  It was great.  But I went to a rehearsal today  and I added a few lines  to comment on the pictures  because I was just so bored  with doing it in clubs.  It's like you become rehearsed  and it's not fun.  And it fucking bombed 
[00:43:00]  so badly in rehearsal.  Oh, no.  Like literally,  it was only staff there  and stuff like that,  but the energy was gone.  I was rushing.  I was awful.  And you could just feel  that there was something  that was like,  uh-oh.  Oh, no.  And fucking-  Were you frightened?  I was just like,  you fucking lackey shithead.  You knew this would happen.  Could you for once  man up and do it?  I was so mad at myself,  but Jay is like,  he's like,  yeah,  you should just leave it  the way you had it.  He's like,  you know,  it's up to you.  I mean,  whatever you feel.  He was very diplomatic about it, 
[00:43:30]  but he was basically saying,  get that other shit out of there.  And I did,  and that's why it worked.  But he's a fucking smart dude, man.  He really did save me.  Yeah,  it was-  Mike Diney,  we got up and nonsense.  Nonsense.  So we were saying  that Leno or NBC  is going to come to you  and go,  look,  you're becoming a big star  with this Jay Leno show.  You're going to have to stop  doing O.P. and Anthony  because they're a little edgy  and they talk about stuff  and it's not good for your image.  It's not good for the Leno show.  Yeah,  we'll watch you walking down the halls  with your people 
[00:44:00]  and we'll try to get you  and you'll be like,  no,  no,  no.  Stop it.  I'm doing hits.  Yeah.  You're right across here  and you're shaking at 45  and we can't get you.  There's nothing you could do  that's ever going to be worse  than me on a cover of a book  with a fat girl  jerking me off under a towel.  That's in print.  That lives on forever.  Do you understand  that ugliness can never be hidden?  Let's have a book burning.  Let's get rid of all that past stuff.  Get rid of every copy.  I like the sound of that,  a book burning.  I had the best week of my life. 
[00:44:30]  The only thing that went wrong,  it wasn't even wrong,  was I was supposed to have lunch with Dio  but I got there.  Too late or something?  The plane landed too late.  How was the Aussie thing?  It was fucking great.  I went to see,  I went to Kevin Smith's house  and watched the movie.  Oh, you didn't do that?  Of course.  You know how it is.  A couple of actors,  a director,  we sit down and watch a movie.  How's this house?  It's huge.  Of course it is.  And Kevin's in a robe.  He looks homeless.  Oh, shit.  He walks in a robe  and it's me and two other guys  that he knows are going to watch.  It's a very big rough cut.  The edits are really choppy.  Does he have a media room?  Yeah, yeah.  It's a big room. 
[00:45:00]  It's got like a giant library  along the head of videotapes.  Slow down, though.  Anthony's home theater  better than Kevin Smith's?  Oh, stop it.  Yeah, of course.  Kevin Smith.  Dude, you have a better home theater  than Kevin Smith.  Well, his is probably more  as a chillitarian.  Yeah, he has a giant...  What are you going to do  with that, Kevin Smith?  Anthony has a better home theater  than you.  Oh, I didn't see any TV  to watch anything.  The monitor we watched the movie on  had like black tape around it.  Maybe that's just to keep it  from reflecting or something like that.  And he just had Mac computers  or PCs set up  and a giant,  like a giant computer, 
[00:45:30]  like you could see  like a giant editing area.  Oh, yeah.  But he just basically  gave us the movie  and then left the room  and left us some snacks.  Because he's sick  of seeing it by now, I'm sure.  How'd it look?  It was good,  but there was no,  it was like hardly any music.  Oh, wow.  The sound is not up.  It's weird to watch  a movie like that.  A lot of edits  are going to be made,  like things fixed,  and he said it's a very rough cut.  But it was so...  Tracy Morgan, of course,  I thought it was  the fucking stall.  He had some fucking lines.  He was like,  Yeah, really good.  Yeah, man.  And I'm still in it so far.  We'll see.  We'll see.  I interrupted you. 
[00:46:00]  You said he had tapes up above?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  He had like a library.  You know how they did  like a library along the wall  where you have a ladder  that you move along?  Yeah.  His are all like DVDs  and videotapes.  Anything cool?  Holy shit.  I didn't look.  It was kind of dim  when I walked in.  Everything.  I would imagine  he has pretty much  everything ever made.  It was a fucking phenomenal.  Did you smoke pot with him?  No.  Kevin came in though.  He goes,  anybody sober?  After the movie.  And I'm like,  yeah, me.  And then he opened the window.  He could tell you  wanted to smoke dope.  But then he starts  asking for critiques.  And this one guy 
[00:46:30]  who's there,  he knows Kevin obviously,  but he's going,  yeah, that one scene,  it took me out of the story  and Kevin's like,  what do you mean?  And they were just  kind of like debating.  And it was your scene.  Yeah.  I know.  You're just sitting there  all for it.  He's like,  who was that fucking  fish-faced nobody?  But it's weird to hear  like you got to have  a thick skin, man.  Because the guy  was just saying like  he wasn't talking  about acting or anything.  He was just talking  about storyline.  And Kevin's like,  oh, that's a good point.  You know,  it's like,  you got to be a thick skin  for the guy.  You can see that  Kevin's like,  it's Jimmy by the 
[00:47:00]  editing machine  trying to put more  of him in.  Wait a minute,  let me put this in.  Going through the  wastebasket  and trying to take  more pieces of him  into the spool.  I just went old school there.  And you know,  it's so weird  when you come back  to the hotel.  I got this message  on fucking Saturday,  not on Friday.  I got this Saturday afternoon.  Oh?  Hold on.  Mm-hmm.  Hi, Jim.  It's Sharon Osbourne.  Firstly,  I'd like to say  thank you so much 
[00:47:30]  for everything last night.  You were fabulous.  As we all knew  you were,  B.  So thank you,  thank you for that.  And I just wanted  to check that  you're coming tomorrow  because we want you  right at the side  of the stage  next to Ozzy.  So I'll call you back  later just to make sure  that you've got  all the passes  and just arrange  a place to me.  So I'll call you later.  Thank you.  Bye. 
[00:48:00]  Jesus.  And I missed that message  by a day.  She actually called me  the next day.  Oh, my God.  She called me.  That's my hotel.  I don't ever check those.  I missed something, though.  She wants you to come back  tomorrow for what?  This was Thursday  we did the tribute.  Right.  To Ozzy.  Friday she called me  to say this  because Ozzy was  performing Saturday.  So she goes to me.  I saw her that night  after the tribute  and she hugged me  and she loved it.  And I go,  where's Ozzy playing?  She goes,  well, in front of the key club.  Do you want to go?  I'm like, yeah.  She goes, okay,  I'll call you tomorrow.  I'm like, yeah, right, okay.  And I didn't hear from her all day. 
[00:48:30]  I guess I slept through  that message.  And then the following day,  Saturday,  she called me  and she woke me up.  It was like noon  and she goes,  hello, naughty Jim Norton.  And she was sitting there  and she goes,  Ozzy's saying hi.  And I'm like,  hey, man, how you doing?  He's like,  I'm a little nervous.  I'm fucking talking  to Sharon Ozzy  on speakerphone.  Oh, my God.  I still had a morning Ron.  I still had a morning Ron  and fucking dumpster breath  when I'm talking to my hero.  Wow.  But I wound up  getting passes.  I told her this,  the first time  the backstage passes 
[00:49:00]  have actually been valid.  Right.  Because they're always shit.  Yeah, they're never really  what you think they're going to be.  These actually got me  into the dressing rooms  and it was fucking amazing  and they were standing there  and she goes,  do you want to bring Ozzy on stage?  We don't have a tape.  What?  She goes,  do you want to bring Ozzy on stage?  And I'm like,  yeah.  So she goes,  okay.  And so I brought him on.  I brought him on fucking stage.  Oh, Jesus.  Fucking best weekend of my life.  You know,  I was telling you this,  I texted you this,  the little boy 
[00:49:30]  that was Jimmy Norton  just loving Ozzy.  I know.  Walking around  with your stupid boombox.  I know.  And then you just,  you know,  you're introducing him.  And there you are.  I just tribute.  Sharon's calling your phone  and you're talking to him  and then bringing him up.  No,  this was live in concert,  dude.  This was in a,  at his show on fucking Saturday  on the strip.  It was in the middle of Sunset Strip.  They had fucking.  Why are they doing that?  He's got something new coming out?  No,  no,  it's a Sunset Strip Music Festival  and they had shut down the street 
[00:50:00]  and they left.  No shit.  And fucking Ozzy was the headliner  for the festival  but there was supposed to be  Chris Cornell  but then they added Ozzy  and Cornell dropped out.  I think he wanted to headline.  Right.  I was like,  what do you want to go after Ozzy?  It's what the matter with you?  Now.  And then he just,  he dropped out.  I would love to see Chris Cornell.  I know.  I wanted to see him too.  I don't know most of the,  I know Korn was on  right before Ozzy  and then of course  after that I walked  to the Viper Room  and watched Ace Frehley  for like an hour.  Ace was there?  Fucking Ace was so badass,  dude.  I didn't get to talk to him  because the Viper Room's tiny  but just fucking Ace  and his almost never singing on time. 
[00:50:30]  It's like,  it's like,  is he still doing it?  Dude,  I couldn't fucking not,  he was making me nervous.  He's standing like  eight feet from the mic  and we're back.  He's like,  Jesus,  you missed it Ace.  But he was great.  He was fucking great.  Almost missing his voice.  Every time.  I can see how that would get you  so nervous too watching.  What's he doing?  Get by the mic.  You have to sing now.  You're in the other room.  What a fucking week you had.  It was amazing, dude.  It was fucking,  it was really fun, man.  It was really fun. 
[00:51:00]  And Michael Moore was a nice dude.  He was like,  yeah,  you know how to do it.  We met Michael Moore  and even Anthony liked him.  You liked the man at the time.  I thought,  personally,  he was a cool guy.  I'm not saying you liked him  because we were talking politics.  Just as a human being,  he was like a regular guy  that's just fucking  in entertainment.  And he was all  rah-rah about us  and we were in between gigs,  weren't we?  Yeah.  And he said something about  the world will always need  punk rockers like yourselves.  Thank you.  I was like,  all right.  It was kind of a cool thing. 
[00:51:30]  God damn.  You're like a little cancer kid  for Make-A-Wish Foundation.  I really had it.  Make-A-Wish Foundation weekend.  The week was so,  it was so perfect.  I know who you met  in the airport,  but before you say that,  Kenny said,  maybe you didn't,  I want to ask this.  Did you or did you not  get a picture with Tom Cruise?  Oh, I have,  no, no.  You were on the same show  with Tom Cruise, my friend.  Yes, but Tom Cruise  was in Boston.  Oh, 10 to 10  is done by Satellite,  which what they do  is him and Carmen, 
[00:52:00]  oh God,  fucking,  Cameron Diaz,  we're in Boston.  I think it was  Logan Airport  they were in.  Okay.  And he's doing  Miley Cyrus this week  from somewhere else,  but that's his way  of getting people on  who are out of state  doing films.  Oh, that's a good idea.  To be honest,  I went to bed  right after your segment  because I had to  I had to go to sleep.  Yes.  It's creepy time.  10.30 is late for me, Jimmy.  All right.  Oh, shit.  Here's a picture.  Just a little picture  from the stage.  I mean,  oh my God.  Let me see.  Who's in the picture?  That's from the Aussie tribute. 
[00:52:30]  That's the end  of the Aussie tribute.  I am looking at  a very happy  and sexy Jimmy Norton  in his black shirt.  And then I'm looking at  That's Billy Morrison  from The Cult.  Oh, okay.  From The Cult.  And then, of course,  is that Tommy Lee?  Yeah.  Tommy Lee, obviously.  And Aussie.  Henry Rollins.  Henry Rollins.  Slash.  And Billy Bob.  Thornton.  Billy Bob Thornton.  Wow.  That's fucking great.  Does Billy Bob like,  you know. 
[00:53:00]  That's just like our  That's just like our  picture of the Iron Sheik,  aren't you?  Sound good.  All I wanted to  Me, you, Ann,  and the Iron Sheik.  It's the same  Dude, all I wanted to  I'm such a  All I wanted to do  is fucking  and talk to him  about Bill Cox's outfit.  Bill Cox's outfit.  But he was nervous  going on  and I actually  gave him a pep talk  before he went on.  Really?  Yeah.  Because the crowd was  Jesus, Jimmy.  He's giving Billy Bob  a pep talk.  I'll tell you why.  Because it was  not a good venue,  the House of Blues  for a tribute  because they were all  they were waiting  to see Camp Freddie, 
[00:53:30]  the band,  they had all these  fucking,  it was great.  But they're a rock crowd.  So they weren't heckling  but there was like  all that talking  you can't avoid that.  Jibba jabba.  They did it through  all,  they did it through  Ozzy when he spoke,  they just were  jabbering at the bar.  It was just,  shut up.  Yeah,  it was a weird place  to do tribute  where there was like,  you know,  but for music  they were fucking great.  Yeah.  Right on, man.  Camp Freddie went up  and played.  Damn.  Yeah,  it was fun.  I was like a little kid.  And General,  Leno was cool?  Leno was,  yeah,  I have to see it  when I go home  but they cut one thing  but it was only for time. 
[00:54:00]  It was not,  for any reasons  I was fine with it.  It was a really good segment.  Oh,  wait,  is that cunt?  No,  they actually left that in.  They said,  could you say it  like with a CH sound?  I'm like,  yeah,  sure,  Jay.  Come in.  Jay was fucking,  it was great,  man.  I was very happy with it.  Me and my girl  were jumping up and down  running around our apartment  like lunatics.  Thank you,  yeah.  She's like,  can I text him?  I'm like,  of course,  you're his friend too.  Yeah,  Lindsay texted me.  I was happy.  She was so fucking excited  for you,  man. 
[00:54:30]  So excited.  Best week ever,  Jim?  Yeah,  it's up there with,  the only thing that rivals it  as far as like being,  it's an Opie and Anthony moment.  You can say it.  That's the top 10.  They're all Opie and Anthony moments.  Me and Ron Jeremy,  fingering stalker patty.  I showed them,  I was backstage,  they spit me out actually.  When they introduced me,  he goes,  Jim Norton,  uninvited guest,  and then some kind of a logo shows  and they actually spin me.  So I actually fucking spin out  and then turn around.  Like in the outfield.  Hello. 
[00:55:00]  Exactly.  Exactly.  You're spinning.  And I'm backstage  and I'm looking at stalker patty's thing  and I'm telling one of the guys  who's making sure my mic is addressed.  I'm like,  yeah,  she's from the radio show  I do,  the Opie and Anthony show  and she's a 53-year-old virgin.  I'm like,  me and Ron Jeremy  were playing with our box together  and the guy fucking,  he didn't acknowledge I had talked.  Oh no.  It was just uncomfortable.  I'm like,  this is fucking network television.  What am I doing  telling radio fingering stories?  You thought you could bond with the guy.  I thought he would get a kick out of it. 
[00:55:30]  Why not?  Anybody should get a kick out of it.  I just don't know if he knew how to take it.  He was like,  oh yeah.  What am I going to say?  Oh, really?  At the end of your segment,  I think someone yelled  Little Jimmy too from the audience.  Yeah, I think someone did too.  I waved to some guy out there.  It's hard to tell because  I heard a Little Jimmy  or something like that.  Yeah, I thought I did too.  But I don't want to  The graphics are good.  Oh my God, Jimmy.  Wow.  Damn it.  Looks professional.  What do you want again?  It looked,  they're originally supposed to be  October 2nd  and then they moved it to  September 25th. 
[00:56:00]  Now it's back to October 2nd  but it's not for an uninvited guest.  It's for another.  Good gravy.  I hope you never get hurt  while that thing spins out.  That looks dangerous.  Believe me,  they're fucking worried about it too.  They're like,  hold on to the desk.  Oh, really?  Yeah, they tell you,  hold on,  because the one guy,  some piece of equipment  got damaged and they turned it  and they're worried  that's going to be a comedian's  mushy head  for them to get my arm ripped off.  You know how awful  that would be for Jay's show?  If I turned out  and I had a bleeding stump  for an arm.  Just screaming on the floor.  Jay, I can't continue. 
[00:56:30]  My arm is back there.  He would partially feel  really bad for me  and then partially be really angry  that my severed arm  had spoiled evening.  A lot of questions coming in.  What did your family think?  I have not talked to them yet  because again,  I was done by  disowning his family already.  Wow.  I was done by  Your mom wants a phone call.  Oh, I'm thinking  Manazi and Sharon.  My new family.  Oh, you mean them?  The Nortons?  Your mom just wants  a phone call from her son.  I'll give her one.  I want her to call me  in another panic-stricken moment.  Were you by the fires again, dear? 
[00:57:00]  Were you in the earthquake  during the one that happened  during the World Series  in 1988?  Whatever year that was.  Kenny said you met  Susan Boyle.  No.  At LAX.  Really?  Did he really say that seriously?  And he got a picture.  Did he get a picture  with anyone at LAX?  Is he trying to be funny?  Were you kidding?  Oh.  Kenny.  I got emails  from your manager's assistant 
[00:57:30]  that I have to immediately  blow up a picture  to 8x10 size  of Susan Boyle  because I guess  she wanted to put it  on the set.  No, here's what happened.  Oh, my God.  I think I know  what happened.  I have a photo  that I was doing the thing.  I was showing Ozzy  all the pictures  I've taken with him  and he smiles  and none of them.  How many hours  did that take?  It was a little while.  My panicky manager  was slipping through them  fast in front of  700 chatty people.  I'm like... 
[00:58:00]  But I didn't want to show  my ex-girlfriend  because she and I broke up  so it's me, Sharon, Ozzy  and my ex-girlfriend.  So I said I have to block out  my ex-girlfriend's face.  I didn't know what to do.  I was going to do  something awful  and put a pig face on it.  Not even...  I was afraid she'd hear about it  and think I was knocking her.  I wish I wouldn't be.  So Jonathan actually suggested  because I'm like  let's just cover it with somebody.  Get somebody like...  Maybe I suggested.  Maybe I said Susan Boyle.  I think I actually did.  And then Jonathan actually 
[00:58:30]  did the Photoshop  where he put Susan Boyle  over my ex-girlfriend.  And I put that picture  on the set.  And I did it.  That's fine.  And Sharon loved it.  She wants a copy of it.  I actually sent her a copy.  She thought it was hilarious.  Very good.  Yeah, but that's  where that was from.  Dolt over here.  No, she actually told me  you met her in the airport.  Who told you that?  Jonathan's assistant.  Then she's dumb.  I'm not going to argue.  She's an idiot too.  Saw a Photoshopped picture  and thought...  Yeah, exactly.  You should see the picture.  It looks nothing like 
[00:59:00]  we're really together.  Susan Boyle's head  is four feet...  It looks like fucking  where three of us  are standing back  to Stonehenge.  It did not look like  a real photo.  How did she believe that?  Kenny was very excited  when I jumped in his car  this morning.  Kenny,  what did you think  of little Jimmy  on Jay Leno's show  last night?  He was great!  Whoa, Tony Tiger.  What'd you like about it?  Well, first of all,  he looked like  a sex symbol.  Oh, Kenny.  You looked really good, Jimmy.  Thank you.  For real.  Thank you. 
[00:59:30]  I didn't pick that shirt out,  but thanks.  You looked like  a rock star or something.  Well, I just wanted  to look like a sweet boy  made good.  And now you look like...  Exactly.  Jim.  You're back to looking  like Jim.  I'm eating it.  You look like Sleepy Boy.  I'm wearing my workout stuff.  I have tinkle stains  all over the front of it.  It's disgusting.  What appears to be  cornflakes on my pants,  but they're not.  Winkle wink.  Get it?  Entertainment Weekly.  Oh, oh.  Are you wearing any undies?  Or was it like  after you peed on the plane, 
[01:00:00]  the piss just trickled  down your leg?  I'm wearing underwear,  but it also trickled  down my leg.  Okay.  I don't know what happens  to me in a plane bathroom,  but I fucking sprinkle  for 25 minutes after.  You don't want it  to smell like a bakery.  There's no reason  to move that quickly  when you're talking.  Did you see Kenny  shucking jive?  Yeah.  Kenny's just very excited.  I know.  He's very happy for you.  And a lot of people  loved your get it  last night also.  Yes, yes.  Well, the get it  was hilarious.  And for the Entertainment  Weekly guy  to put that in his critique 
[01:00:30]  is so stupid.  He's a fucking twat.  He doesn't get it.  Fuck him.  He's a blogger.  Sit home and vlog.  He doesn't realize  how embarrassing  it is to him  that he put get it.  Dude, he probably got it.  Proving he did not get it.  Even if he did get it  and just didn't like it,  I accept that.  But it's like,  all right, hey, look,  you know what?  I can't even credit it.  If he thought it was lame,  that is his opinion.  He's entitled to it.  And that's a legitimate thing.  If he says,  hey, it was lame,  but to say I would have  been insulted,  shut up.  Stop trying to be clever.  Just say you thought it sucked.  I can accept that  even though I don't agree. 
[01:01:00]  One of our listeners  was in the audience.  Bob in North Carolina.  Bob.  Hey, guys.  Hey, Jimmy.  You rocked last night.  Thank you, Bob.  I was yelling out  Jimmy and O&A.  I don't know if anyone  called on there.  Did I look over at you?  Were you stage left?  Because there was a guy  stage left  who at the end  I thought I heard.  Little Jimmy.  Yeah.  Yeah, that was me.  You made my night.  What were you wearing?  Was it a short-sleeved shirt?  Yeah.  I actually remember you.  Oh, thank you.  It was great.  You know,  Jay was eating it up, too.  I was watching him. 
[01:01:30]  He was enjoying it, too.  Yeah, I think he was happy  that it was going well  because I took his suggestions  to all of them.  He was a fucking smart dude, man.  And he really,  he wouldn't let me do it  the way I wanted to  either way.  But, you know,  something I'm going to do,  tell him how to do  late-night TV.  He was right, too.  His suggestions were right.  And you can really tell  that Jay really likes you.  You can just tell.  Yeah, I think he does.  How he talks about you  and stuff.  Thank you, Bob.  Yeah, he's been very generous with you.  Let's go to Tom in Chicago.  Tom.  Gentlemen,  happy birthday,  little Jimmy.  Thank you, Tom.  It's Godspeed.  You know, Jimmy,  that was incredible last night. 
[01:02:00]  And I'm going to work  as hard as I can  to still get your domain name back.  Thank you, man.  I'm still trying.  Thanks, man.  But anyway, hey,  I never saw more advertisement  for SiriusXM  than in that segment of TV.  Yeah, don't even get us started.  Dude,  Wow Sticker,  SiriusXM,  Opie and Anthony.  Come on.  Jimmy did more for us  than SiriusXM has done.  Yeah.  We've been with Sirius  over a year now officially,  believe it or not.  That's a fast year.  Wow.  And Jimmy did more for us  marketing-wise 
[01:02:30]  last night  than this company has done.  And it's dumb little things  like this you could do  to get the word out.  Yeah, it's like little  pop culture things.  And I figured that,  you know,  for the fans  and stuff like that,  it would be,  you know,  plus for us,  it's just,  it's cool.  It's comfortable  to have fucking  dumb Patty there.  I wanted to tell you  there's more pictures  I want to get.  There's more stuff  I want to start removing.  I just didn't do it  this time.  Just for that alone,  this company should  give you no shit  whatsoever.  I'm sure they will.  Well, what do you think?  You just got  the SiriusXM logo  and the name of 
[01:03:00]  one of their  more popular shows  on a show that  was just seen by,  who knows,  we'll know later today  how many,  but millions of people.  Yeah.  Could be close to  15, 16 million people  saw SiriusXM,  Opie and Anthony  last night.  That's why they should  put the channel  name Opie and Anthony  so people have Sirius  they just look,  but that would be.  Look how easy that was.  I mean,  they could learn  from Jimmy.  That's all you have to do.  It doesn't cost money.  I'll do it again  on Red Eye tonight.  It's here and there.  Right.  I'll bring my  wow sticker on Red Eye  tonight and I'll hold it up.  Oh boy,  what a drop off that is. 
[01:03:30]  No, it's just.  From Leno  to our show  to Red Eye.  Jesus.  I'm happy to.  What's next?  A podcast?  What the fuck, Jimmy?  Fuck you now.  No, Red Eye's  599th show tonight.  You believe that,  motherfuckers,  they invited me  on the 600th  but I couldn't  and they'd be in Connecticut.  599 is almost as good.  It's one less.  Oh, how great would it be  if a fucking Gutfeld  fell into a ditch  and broke his spine  and couldn't do number 600  and they'd hire someone else  and they'd fire Greg?  This is a heartbreaker. 
[01:04:00]  We would take pleasure.  Oh God,  it could have been  so easily avoided.  Would we bask in it?  We're just horrible.  All right,  why don't we take  our first break.  Jimmy's luggage is here.  Yeah, you know,  let's, we'll  Luggage.  We'll reorganize.  We'll fill you in  on everything  that's been going on  since you've been gone,  Jimmy.  Pete Diddy was,  I think,  right next door yesterday.  Yeah, was he?  Who the hell knows?  But his people  brought him around  the long way  so he wouldn't  walk by our studio  and the politics  is getting just  ridiculous around here. 
[01:04:30]  We're fucking ridiculous.  Of course it is.  Yeah.  We're fucking ridiculous.  Try getting him  to fucking keep a promise.  All right,  with that,  we go to break.  We played this late  in the show yesterday,  Anthony Dundee,  the Hyman hunter.  The Hyman hunter.  This is,  this is just terrific.  Opie and Anthony,  but first this.  Shot in the dark.  Nice.  Let's play this one  out today. 
[01:05:00]  Why not?  Oh, I thought  you meant now.  You mean leave?  I was like,  yeah,  we just leave now.  Sam,  you wouldn't mind  if we left early today  because it's a big day  for Jimmy.  He just got back  from L.A.  He was on Leno last night.  We really feel like  we should leave early  and celebrate  Jay Leno's  Jim Norton appearance.  Well,  I'm not going to tell you guys  what to do,  of course,  but I think the biggest  celebration you could have  for Jim would be  to let all the listeners  celebrate with you  and by that,  I mean do another  home run show.  What do you guys think?  What a pep talk  he gives us every day. 
[01:05:30]  Oh,  is that his thing  he's giving pep talks?  Yeah.  He's very good.  I don't get it.  Well,  he's like a young gunslinger  and I,  well,  let's be honest,  we've been doing this  a real long time.  We're jaded,  we're like disillusioned  with the business.  He's a young buck  who's just taken the world  by the balls right now  and thinks he's got  his whole future  ahead of him.  He's got passion.  So he's got the passion.  So yeah.  He's dreaming about radio  at night.  So all we want to do  is cash a check  and go home.  Right.  And he, 
[01:06:00]  he just gives us  that pep talk  that we,  we kind of need,  we've,  we've forgotten  that passion,  Opie.  Yeah.  So we make them  look into our  tired faces  every morning.  Yeah.  And we tell them  this will be you someday.  Oh,  the happy to be here kid.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So keep dreaming.  And then after the whole  thing's over,  we have to go,  now there's going  to be listeners  that go,  I told you  they just got  a cash check.  Right.  And,  and the bit.  See Sam,  dreams do come true.  All right.  And then you,  then you just become  miserable and bitter.  The dream's not over. 
[01:06:30]  Really.  Your guys' dreams  can continue.  With each and every show,  you get a little bit bigger.  You know what I mean?  Yes,  of course.  What?  If people are asking  if I'm stuttering John,  see how I just cut you off  because I just figured it down.  Well,  the bit really wasn't  working today.  We'll try again.  The hole was done talking.  Oh,  we got to tell Jimmy  about the hole.  But really fast,  Jimmy,  a couple of people  have asked,  especially Joe here,  did stuttering John  get the axe  from the new  Jane Leno show?  No,  he's writing for him. 
[01:07:00]  He's actually writing  a lot of bits.  But he's just not  on camera?  I don't know.  He was the announcer,  but I don't know  if he's going to be doing,  he's going to be appearing  in sketches and stuff,  but no,  John's still there.  Was he announcing  last night?  No.  I think they just  switched that.  But I don't know why.  I saw John,  he's like,  he seems fine with it.  He's like,  no,  I'm just writing.  Okay.  All right,  that's good to know.  I went to the worst  barbecue ever at his house.  Oh,  that picture you sent me  was hysterical.  That fucking,  it was like a diaphragm  hibachi.  I'm like,  what are you cooking in that?  It was the worst hibachi ever.  His little fucking grill. 
[01:07:30]  And he has a 30 foot flame  under a roof.  What are you doing?  Someone's saying  that I should stop  kissing your ass.  Trucker Dan,  what's up?  Man,  why don't you guys  quit reveling  in Jimmy's glory  and let us hear  the clip ourselves?  Well,  you fucking asshole.  Where's your fucking dedication  that you didn't watch it last night?  Yeah,  what are you doing?  We're driving a truck,  dipshit.  We don't drive trucks  and watch TV at the same time.  Don't you? 
[01:08:00]  You should be safer,  you fucking psychopath.  Do you have a computer?  No.  You can kill a hooker  and drive at the same time.  Exactly.  Do crank.  All right,  I'm sorry I cursed you out.  I didn't realize you're a trucker  and you're driving 18 hours a day.  Listen to me.  Listen to me.  You usually show a clip  of the performance.  I apologize,  but here's the problem.  There's a lot of visuals  so I don't even know  if we should play  Jimmy's segment.  Yeah,  it's like a visual thing too.  We should leave it up to Jimmy.  Watch it online.  Yay!  I think it would be way better 
[01:08:30]  to watch online  because,  I mean,  the pictures  that they show  in between,  you know,  the jokes and stuff  are just,  just bring it all together.  I'm a truck driver.  It really brings it all together.  I mean,  Dan,  I'm not,  no,  Dan,  I'm serious.  I mean,  if it was just pure stand-up,  like one of his sets  on Leno,  yeah,  we would have already  played it,  but I think it does  some injustice  if you don't see  the visuals  that go along with it.  That's all.  Okay,  well,  I apologize,  Dan.  I'm used to hearing  the performances. 
[01:09:00]  Yeah,  maybe we should explain that,  but no,  there's a lot of visuals  in what Jimmy was doing  last night.  A lot.  Just simmer down,  Dan.  You know what,  Dan,  I'm having a panic attack.  Wrong with you.  You know what,  Dan,  I'm sorry too.  Me and you  are going to be friends,  Dan.  Me and you.  I hope his next stop  is the titty twister.  Oh,  is that in Dusty Dawn  where the trucker's  going to get killed?  Just don't kill me  and put me in a shallow grave,  okay?  That's all I ask.  Or if you do, 
[01:09:30]  at least give a clue  where I am  so my family  could bury me properly.  Yeah,  have some closure.  I don't want to be  eaten by coyotes  after you'll leave me for dead.  Bones were found  scattered around  as if animals  have gotten to the body.  All right,  Dan,  thank you.  I hope I explain that.  I love the show.  All right,  brother.  All right,  brother.  All right.  Holy shit,  asshole.  I have it right up here  on my screen,  Jimmy Carter.  Yeah,  we're going to get into  the Jimmy Carter thing,  but just because I said coyote,  I have to know,  did Jessica Simpson's dog 
[01:10:00]  really get taken  by a coyote  right in front of her?  Come on,  that's great.  Please tell me  this is true.  If that really happened.  That is what they're reporting.  She put out...  What do we know on this?  A coyote came  and she has a tiny little  like pappy poodle  or something like that.  Oh, great.  Yeah,  and a coyote just came.  So it wasn't even  an ugly dog?  No,  you've got to say,  I'm looking for a picture right now.  So if it's a cute,  adorable dog,  it just makes it that much worse.  It's adorable. 
[01:10:30]  It's the cutest dog  you've ever seen in your life.  And a coyote just came  and scooped it right up.  Right in front of her?  Yep.  And she put out flyers  because she didn't see  it get killed or anything.  But she saw the coyote  take the dog away?  Yeah.  What did she think  the coyote was going to do?  Maybe put it down  somewhere else.  Okay.  It's going to be like  its new friend.  And they found  the corpse of the dog?  No,  she put out flyers  saying,  please find my dog  who could be somewhere.  Flyers for a coyote?  No,  for the dog  because she thinks... 
[01:11:00]  No,  I mean the coyote got it.  What's a coyote going to go?  All right.  Let's bring it back.  Where was she?  Why did the coyote  just grab the dog like that?  I don't know.  Maybe she lives  in Arizona or something.  I don't know.  Here in L.A.,  you've got to...  The coyotes just love  your dogs.  You know what she should have done?  Painted a fake train tunnel  on the side of a mountain  and the coyote  would have run right into it.  I saw that on TV.  It works.  That's genius.  Yes.  Should we call Acme?  Yes.  There he is.  Is it Acme?  Oh,  is that the little...  It looks like a Bichon Frise.  It's a Maltipoo.  It's a cute dog. 
[01:11:30]  That could be the cutest dog ever.  A Maltese and a poodle?  Yeah,  look at that dog.  All right,  now I'm depressed for her.  That's the cutest dog ever,  Sean.  Daisy is saying,  I miss my mommy.  That's Daisy.  Daisy is going,  as it's being fucking disemboweled  by a coyote.  She's looking...  What does she think?  Does the coyote hit it  behind a juniper bush?  It's dead!  And licking its fur?  It's dead!  Keeping it nice and clean  until Jessica finds it.  Coyote got it,  you see? 
[01:12:00]  Maybe the Maltipoo  outsmarted the coyote  and ran away.  Oh,  really,  Sam?  Yeah.  You think that's...  Roadrunner.  You think that happened?  Good.  No,  the Maltipoo  could do nothing but bleed.  Hopefully,  it bled on the coyote  so badly  that the coyote  had to leave  because its nose  was clogged  with drying blood.  That's the only way  the Maltipoo  is getting away.  The Maltipoo  is now going to be  Coyote Poo.  I miss my mommy,  Daisy.  Like,  wait,  did the dog  write its own 
[01:12:30]  fucking  wanted poster there?  I think they're saying  what the dog  might be saying right now.  No.  No.  You'll recognize it  because she has  a little collar  with her name  and she's possibly  headless.  Yeah,  right.  You'll recognize her  because she's been  eviscerated by a coyote  and she's unresponsive  to anything but flies.  Look,  the coyote ate it.  What the fuck  do you think a coyote  does?  They don't do this.  There's not a kidnapping.  You think there's  going to be a phone call  demanding something?  God.  Well,  there you go. 
[01:13:00]  Jessica Simpson.  I love it.  She's hurting.  It's the dog  Nick Lachey gave to her  when they were still together.  She wants to get  back together with Nick.  Of course she does.  It's the dumbest move  she ever made.  That's the word  on the street, Sam.  Really?  I wouldn't want to get  back together.  Remember when you used  to do what's the haps?  See, you're already  getting lazy.  I've been waiting  getting lazy.  You haven't done  one of them in months.  What's going on?  Nothing.  Why are you getting lazy?  I'm not getting lazy.  Nobody's been online  for anything lazy.  Jimmy Carter.  Sorry.  No, that's all I had  to say about him. 
[01:13:30]  What a douche.  We got the audio.  He's just an ass.  Jimmy Carter thinks  a lot of anti-Obama  sentiment  is racially motivated.  There's some of that  though.  Come on.  I'm not saying there's not  but when the guy goes  you're a liar  because you're talking  about taxes being raised  or whatever  it's like  what a dick Carter is.  Maybe some of it  is racially motivated  but the biggest complaints  I've heard about Obama  not one complaint  have I heard  has been  he's helping black people  too much.  It's simply  he is going  to raise taxes  too much. 
[01:14:00]  The same complaints  that Jimmy Carter got  because he was  a fucking tax  and spend Democrat.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's amazing.  But to bring out  the race thing  is ridiculous.  Last week's act  was based on racism.  It's not based on racism  it's based on the fact  that this guy  is the president  is telling  what his position  is on this health care thing.  This guy just got  so fucking  fuming frustrated.  You ever listen  to somebody talk  and you're just like  no!  No!  Shut up! 
[01:14:30]  Yes.  Every time you discuss  the second amendment.  Jesus.  Jesus.  I like my right.  I know.  I agree with you.  I thought he was  talking generally.  I did not know  he was referencing  what happened.  Yeah.  With that  He's talking about  the guy saying  liar.  Right.  Okay.  I did not know that.  Let's see if that's  actually motivated.  The five black kids  beat up the white kids.  Oh wait till you hear  that one Jimmy.  That's another story  I already read  the cop's remark.  No we got the audio.  Wait for you to hear this.  Let's save that.  What is it?  The news? 
[01:15:00]  Yeah.  The newscast.  Let's save it  because Jimmy's very happy  right now.  Let's keep Jimmy happy  for a while and then  we're going to get  into this that's just  going to get everyone  outraged.  This is what Jimmy  Carter had to say.  I think an overwhelming  portion of the  intensely demonstrated  animosity toward  President Barack Obama  is based on the fact  that he is a black man.  That he's African American.  We get it.  I live in the south  and I've seen the south 
[01:15:30]  come a long way  and I've seen the rest  of the country  that shared the south  attitude toward  minority groups  at that time  particularly African Americans.  That racism  inclination still exists  and I think it's  bubbled up to the  surface  because of  a belief among  many white people  not just in the south  but around the country  that African Americans  are not  qualified  to lead this  great country.  Shut the fuck up. 
[01:16:00]  It's an abominable  circumstance.  Abominable.  And grieves me  and concerns me  very deeply.  Jesus, Jimmy Carter.  Go fucking  grow your peanuts  and shut the fuck up.  Wow.  What an asshole  this guy is.  Just shut the fuck up.  You think subconsciously  that's what he thinks?  10% of this country  is black.  Maybe 12%.  They're moving up.  The guy  12%.  They're moving up.  The fucking  president won  the election. 
[01:16:30]  Not on 12%  of the vote.  White people  voted for the  fucking guy, okay?  Especially since  the complaints  have been taxes.  It's all been money.  And the people  that are bringing up  race are the  fucking other side,  the Democrats,  saying that the  people that are  against these taxes  are racist.  They bring that  fucking racist  word up every second.  People protesting  taxes and  it's like  it's all financial.  Yep.  It's fucking  mind-boggling.  It's all about  the Benjamins, yo.  Glenn Beck's terrible  for saying Obama's  a racist. 
[01:17:00]  I don't agree with  him, but it's like  he said it  and they want to  kill him for it  and yet Kanye West  can fucking say  that Bush doesn't  care about black  people and that  it's such a  fucking horse  shit double  standard.  Stop it.  Can you imagine  if a country  western singer  had run up  and I think  look personally  I think Kanye  was sorry.  It looked like  he was sorry.  I mean look  he fucked up  and I think  he realized  he tried about  his mommy.  I think he realized  he fucked up  big time.  I agree with  you now.  I actually think  that he really  thinks he fucked  up.  But can you  imagine  there was not  one mention 
[01:17:30]  of that.  Can you imagine  if a country  western singer  had run up  and just  snatched the  microphone  out of the  hand of say  a young  19 year old  black singer  like there  would have  been at least  a racial mention.  And then started  saying how  another white  artist video  was better  than the young  black girl  artist.  There would  have been  absolute racial  fucking outrage.  And the Kanye  West thing was  definitely a white  black thing.  Well he thinks  that they don't  vote.  He said that.  He doesn't think  that they vote  for black people  accurately.  That was a white 
[01:18:00]  black thing.  Hold on.  Is he out of  his fucking mind?  Yes.  Yes he is.  That was so  just a black  white thing.  Isn't it just  black people  that win every  fucking award  now?  As far as  music awards  go?  Beyonce did  win video  of the year.  Yeah.  Thank you.  I mean just  stop with the  fucking racism  as an excuse  for everything.  It's over.  It's done.  The president's  fucking black.  Enough.  Shut up.  And we said  right away  imagine Kanye  doing that to  like 50  sand or 
[01:18:30]  somebody.  Never.  Of course not.  Never.  Well that's  because black  that would be  black and black  but alright  name some  there's no  like hardcore  white guys  anymore on MTV  so I don't even  have a good  white example.  Faggy fucking  no haircut  shitheads.  Eminem let's  say but he's  more in the  Eminem's bodyguards  would have jumped  in.  Eminem doesn't  really attack  I'm just saying  that's what was  embarrassing for  Kanye West.  He went after  a girl.  17 year old  girl.  18 year old  girl.  A little skinny  fucking white  chick.  Tiny little  thing.  That is the  epitome like 
[01:19:00]  fucking Patrice  said.  White chicks  look at her  and go oh my  god she is so  white.  How humiliating  for Kanye West  though.  I mean everybody  not one person  that meant  anything thought  that he did  anything right.  For Obama to be  overheard saying  he's a jackass.  How embarrassing  for the leader  of the free  world to call  you a jackass.  The best we could  pull off was the  mayor going stupid.  They're stupid.  When Giuliani  called us stupid.  But for the  president to call  you a jackass. 
[01:19:30]  That's great.  And not even  meant for it to  be overheard so  you know that's  how he really  feels.  You're a black  artist and the  first black  president just  thinks you're a  fucking boob.  A jackass.  Oh what a great  Yankee fight last  night.  Did you see that?  A big bench  clearing brawl?  Melee.  Old school.  Posada.  What happens  now when there's  a bench clearing  brawl?  Does everyone  get fined and  suspended?  I think Posada  and the asshole  fucking pitcher or  something from the  other team was  reprimanded.  What happened? 
[01:20:00]  Joe Girardi got a  black eye.  Did he really?  Yeah.  He got right.  Oh that rocks.  Girardi is fucking  great.  I think he's  fucking great.  Yankee fans didn't  like him at first.  Well you know  I had a rough  little start.  To get over  Torrey.  He had to follow  Torrey.  You're right.  And a big prostate  to fill.  You had to have a  year in between  Torrey and  Girardi.  Now that  Torrey is just  like a fucking  really good  manager.  Although the  Yankees lost  the game. 
[01:20:30]  They can't win  every game.  They've done  very well.  I'm very happy  with the team  and Joe  Girardi.  I'm glad they  listened to me.  I got a nice  consulting fee from  the Yankees.  Did you?  Yeah I told  him Girardi.  Told him.  I was like  what?  What's that?  Girardi?  What advice did  you give to the  Mets?  Fucking jump  off cliffs and  break your bones  and I don't  acknowledge the  Mets.  Did their  fucking charter  plane crash and  no one talked  about it and  they just said  just play.  Just play. 
[01:21:00]  I don't  acknowledge the  Mets.  You would have  heard about that.  Oh literal  Jim is here.  Football season  has begun.  It's all about  the Jets now my  friend.  Is it?  1-0 baby.  1-0.  Beat that.  They're like  fucking 1-0.  Undefeated.  They're undefeated  right now.  My team undefeated.  Yours not so much.  Well come on.  You got a bunch of  losses in there.  Well it's baseball.  Has any team ever  not lost the game? 
[01:21:30]  That would be an  amazing feat for a  baseball team wouldn't  it?  Oh Jesus.  You have to go  back to 1805 when  Abner Doubleday was  playing.  We've got to tell  Jimmy about the  hole.  Yeah.  Oh no.  We have a new  website called  LoseTheHole.com  Our whole new  thing Jimmy we're  going to get all  the holes fired from  Locker Room Talk  radio shows.  Because they don't  belong there.  They're further  ruining radio and 
[01:22:00]  this is a way we  can actually help  out.  A lot of things in  radio we can't help  out.  Radio is destroying  itself.  We can't really do  anything.  It's management and  shit like that.  But this is somewhere  this is a place where  Opie said yesterday we  can give back.  We're going to give  back.  We're going to give  back.  We're finally giving  back to radio and our  advice is to get rid of  the hole.  Put them in middays.  Let them do noontime  blocks.  Put them late night if  they have sexy voices so  guys can jerk off.  But as far as being part  of a locker room type  morning show. 
[01:22:30]  Adios.  It's time to get rid of  all of them.  All of them.  Yeah.  Except for Robin.  You know.  I mean we explained  that perfectly.  Howard picking Robin  really fucked radio  bad.  It worked for him but  then everyone decided  to try to copy that.  That formula was going  to work for everybody  and have an edgy show  with some broad in  there to keep  everything safe.  So you can get away  with stuff and so she  can calm the guys  down.  Oh the boys.  Oh the boys are out  of control.  Let me throw in a  fucking wrench into  these gears. 
[01:23:00]  Steven S.  from Bayshore.  Dump the clump.  So the show  out of Baltimore  kind of took some  shots at us.  You know the drill  right Jimmy?  Of course.  Which show?  98 Rock.  But it turns out  it's got an interesting  twist this story Jimmy.  It's got a twist.  Is this new stuff?  This is like.  I like a twist.  Yes.  This is like the  sixth sense.  So I guess.  Attention.  Oh my god.  Attention.  Oh my dear sweet  Jesus Christ. 
[01:23:30]  Hold on a minute.  Hold on a minute.  Hold on.  You did not come to  work like that.  Hey Watley.  Holy shit.  It's here.  You did not come to  work like that.  This is not work.

This is  fantastic  because  you really  look great.  I don't think  I've ever seen  friends look  better. 
[01:27:30]  I feel good.  You have like  a gusto  and a spunk  to you today.  Oh yes.  You're ready  to march.  Yes.  Just ready  to march.  Fantastic.  Remember  one week  for tomorrow  I demand  that you  all be there.  Yes.  Thank you Fez.  Thank you.  There he goes.  Wow.  Okay.  I'm ready.  I'm ready.  I'm ready.  I'm ready.  Sometimes in fashion  you're in  sometimes you're out.  There goes Fez. 
[01:28:00]  Take it easy sir.  Holy shit  he's so fired.  Oh my god.  You can't  I don't think  you can walk around  the workplace  like that.  No not at all.  Holy shit.  That is amazing.  The resemblance  is uncanny.  Fuck what is wrong  with him?  He's going to the  bunker now.  Oh I fucking  spilled coffee  all over the board.  Oh no.  Block that out.  Look it's everywhere.  You got one fader.  I'm not even joking.  Whose fader is that?  I hope it's not mine. 
[01:28:30]  Fuck.  We might go off the air.  No.  I hope that isn't  my fader.  Anthony.  I can't hear you  that well.  That was just a gag.  Paper.  Crumble paper  and then you talk funny.  We got to do  a little clean up.  We'll continue.  All righty.  Fez just threw us  all off our game.  Where is he now? 
[01:29:00]  Down the hall.  Getting out of the outfit  so he doesn't get fired?  Oh my god.  That is a great picture.  You got to email me that.  I need that as some  type of sig pic.  Look at how he looks.  That just goes to show you  pretty much anyone  could play Hitler.  You just got to get  the little mustache  and grease your hair  to the side a little bit.  He looks crazier than Hitler.  He looks like Hitler  without the fucking  planning skills.  Without the fucking  moderation  and self-control. 
[01:29:30]  Fucking Hick Morrow  showing the picture off.  Welcome back, Jim.  Welcome back, Jim.  All right.  We're going to continue  in just a bit.  Hopi and Anthony  stay there.  Sorry we took a little  long to get back  from break  but we had a mishap.  They had to lay down  some sawdust  to soak up  all the coffee.  That could have been  a disaster.  But we're in the middle  of doing something  and then the door opens  in Fez from the 
[01:30:00]  Ron and Fez show.  Next thing you know  he's in studio  yelling and screaming.  He's dressed up  exactly like Hitler.  During the break  I'm telling Anthony  there's no way  that could be legal.  I don't think you're  even allowed to do that.  Even in America.  I think it's legal.  I know in Germany  that's completely  against the law.  Yeah, yeah.  I think it's legal  but it's tasteless.  It's extremely tasteless  and we won't stand for it.  I guess Ron and Fez  had a bet.  Fez lost a bet. 
[01:30:30]  He has to walk around  with a Hitler mustache  for two weeks  or something like that.  Yeah, him and Dave  of course made another bet.  Right.  And he's got to walk around  for a couple of weeks  with a Hitler mustache.  Yeah.  So he shaved his mustache  into the Hitler mustache.  And I saw the mustache  yesterday after the show  with Ant.  We were having a little meeting  about the bit from yesterday.  And then Fez,  he walked in  and we got to see  the Hitler mustache  that he's sporting  for two weeks.  But it was kind of grayish  and it was just Fez  with a Hitler mustache.  Today, it was like 
[01:31:00]  he's blackened it.  Yeah, it's very dark.  He blackened it.  He darkened the mustache,  his hair.  His hair.  And then he greased his hair  and swooped it over  like Hitler.  Yep.  He's wearing a brown shirt.  Yep.  With a brownish,  a darker brown tie  and goose-stepping  around the studios.  And on top of that,  he's got crazy eyes.  Yes, much like the Fuhrer.  Fez, he's got crazy eyes.  Look.  Oh, God.  We're just watching 
[01:31:30]  a little video clip  from earlier.  I'm uploading the appearance  on my YouTube channel,  OP Radio.  You've got to see it  for yourself.  Amazing.  But the guy,  completely insane.  And then he ran out of here,  so I don't know  where he is now.  I mean,  I don't think the boss  is going to be happy  with Fez running around  as Hitler.  You know how many,  you know how many,  uh,  are associated  with SiriusXM?  I don't think the Nazis?  Well...  Yeah.  One.  Stage left,  even. 
[01:32:00]  Uh,  no,  and you know who,  I mean,  the old gag,  you know who runs  the media.  Yes.  And this is a pretty  big media company,  and you got one  of your employees  walking around like,  uh,  Hitler?  That's not smart.  I think Ronnie should,  uh,  really start taking  applications,  because now it's  just a matter of time.  It's just a matter of time.  Not,  not smart.  And people say,  we're the dumb ones  around here.  Well,  well,  we are,  but people would be right.  Anyway,  what were you talking about?  Oh, 
[01:32:30]  so another,  Jimmy,  so another show  kind of taking shots  at us.  Okay.  Uh,  the producer,  it turns out the producer  of this show  is a huge fan of our show.  I mean,  huge.  And when he was,  uh,  driving into work  with,  uh,  the main guy,  Mickey,  from this morning show,  uh,  I guess our show was on,  so there was a discussion  about it,  blah,  blah,  blah.  It turns out the Mickey  guy is also a fan.  All right?  Now,  we had inadvertently  mistaken,  uh,  we thought  that he didn't like the show.  Didn't like us.  Thought it was talented.  Thought a war was starting. 
[01:33:00]  So,  so wait,  what,  let me,  let me pretend  to be surprised here.  Somebody says something  and you guys just react  and then realize  it was incorrect.  Um,  yeah,  all right.  No,  and people said  they look like  the bizarro us.  Two guys.  Got goatees  and shaved heads.  Why is the guy  holding his chin  looking up?  He looks pensive  as if he's deep in thought.  Yeah,  he's thinking.  Um,  but,  but the guy turned it around  on his own show  saying,  no,  I actually like these guys.  I like these guys. 
[01:33:30]  And he was able to back out  and save face.  Yeah.  But as he was backing out  and saving face,  the hole.  Yes,  the hole.  Got involved.  And Ant and I basically said,  we said to Mickey  on our show,  look,  get rid of the hole  and you'll have a much better show.  We'll support you guys.  Got to get rid of it.  It sounds like you got  something going on.  No,  she was thrust upon you.  We know it.  Um,  just,  eh,  just like,  get rid of her.  I like to get the lady's opinion though.  I want the lady's take.  Yeah, 
[01:34:00]  well,  yeah,  as he was explaining,  I'm going to replay this clip  from yesterday.  As he was explaining  the whole situation,  the hole tries to get in  because she still wants  to take shots at us  because we beat the shit  out of her,  Jimmy.  Oh,  it was bad.  Has anybody talked to Mike?  You know,  he had the big day yesterday.  Oh,  geez.  And,  uh,  another radio show  was talking about.  Yeah,  they sicked their listeners on me  and I got three whole emails.  Well,  anyway,  that's the hole.  Now,  what are you going to hear?  That's a girl?  Yeah.  I know. 
[01:34:30]  That's not a chick.  We were saying that too.  What a voice,  huh?  Yeah.  What a sexy voice.  It's not a chick.  I don't believe it.  Now,  the advice we gave Mickey was,  look,  the hole's going to ruin your show  so just ignore her  and this was the next day  after we told him that  and you could already hear  he's trying to ignore the hole.  She got three whole emails.  Does she mean H-O-L-E?  Oh,  that's what she meant.  Yeah.  She got three emails,  Jimmy.  You think that's real?  No.  I think she might have lies.  Perhaps more than her.  But she's just downright pissed.  Yeah,  they sick their listeners on me 
[01:35:00]  and I got three whole emails.  Well,  anyway,  the point I'm making,  you hear that anyway?  He's so enamored by it.  Yeah.  Yeah,  he's like,  he edited it all.  There's all the audio  of those guys  talking about us.  I love this.  And so it was just hilarious.  He's so freaking...  Went to sleep to it last night  like a lullaby.  Yeah.  He probably did  just play it over and over again.  No one help me out.  I'm trying to think of  if I'm a fan of anything that much. 
[01:35:30]  Like where I would like freak out.  Yeah,  your car.  No,  you spent six months.  Is she in the witness protection program  and they're changing her voice?  Like,  uh,  yeah,  I was a mafia wife  and,  um,  yeah,  I would dress very sexually  and go to,  uh,  some of these mafia.  You're right.  You sound like a man.  She sounds like Jodie Foster  in Silence of the Lambs  going under the garage.  Oh,  Oh God,  that was so bad.  Yeah.  That awful voice 
[01:36:00]  and I don't know  if I'm a big fan of anything.  Apparently large gums.  Don't,  she should have a fucking  green apple between those teeth.  I have never seen  a larger  tooth gum ratio  on a human head before.  It's giant.  She's atrocious.  Uh-huh.  And then Mickey continues.  So remember,  we gave Mickey advice.  Ignore the hole.  You'll be a lot better.  Yes.  Blah,  blah,  blah.  But Amelia,  they were so harsh on you.  You know what?  I really don't care.  I know you don't,  but I,  I just,  I couldn't,  I was listening. 
[01:36:30]  They hate women.  They're misogynist  or at least that's what they play on.  I got to tell you though,  like,  they really don't like women,  but it was hilarious.  I mean,  it's all about how women are,  are assholes  and have really no redeeming quality  except for one thing.  So they're doing reality radio.  Yeah,  right.  They do reality radio then.  Good.  No,  but yeah,  like,  the other thing is  you also have to put it in perspective.  They're our peers.  They're in the same business.  They're doing the same exact thing we're doing.  They're not doing anything  that's all that much better.  Trust me. 
[01:37:00]  Yeah,  and they're actually,  they went up  and now they're kind of like,  I mean,  I don't,  you know,  there's shows on all across the country.  Yeah,  but I mean,  they,  they had it all.  And then,  something,  something went awry.  I mean,  I'm not,  I'm not knocking them for,  they're still working.  God bless them.  Shut up.  Thank you,  Jimmy.  We're more than just working,  you fucking twat.  She just has big gums.  Yeah.  I don't like her gums.  They flap a lot too.  I guarantee you  that her teeth get dry.  I don't like this lady  and her fucking,  you know,  people with dry teeth 
[01:37:30]  because they're fucking,  their lips are not big enough  to cover their awful horse teeth.  Yeah,  and she's,  she is giant too.  Maybe she's got that giantism.  You know,  when I was in the third grade,  I was on the female basketball team.  It was fantastic.  How tall were you in third grade?  Oh,  third grade,  I had my eighth growth spurt  and I was six foot eight.  In third grade?  In third grade.  And I was growing by the day.  Were you just a normal child  even though you were very tall?  You know something,  regular kid,  regular girl,  I liked putting on makeup. 
[01:38:00]  I put her on pretty clothes.  Yeah.  Yeah,  I like to look pretty.  Where did you get your clothes  because you wouldn't fit  into the regular size clothes?  My mother had to sew them.  Really?  Yeah,  she'd buy one dress  and make,  or two dresses  and make one out of it.  How tall were you  in the sixth grade?  Sixth grade,  I really perked up there.  I was just about  tipping at seven foot.  Seven foot for sixth grade.  Seven foot at sixth grade.  And then my pituitary gland  started pumping fluid  into my gums. 
[01:38:30]  And my gums grew too.  So I got big gums  and giant fucking talon feet.  She really is a toothy broad,  isn't she?  Nice teeth,  dick.  Shut up.  You're a fucking  crated toothpaste.  Paint roller it on,  you fucking  toothy zilch.  Quiet fucking  Fred Gwynn voice.  I don't like them,  Eddie.  Every day,  after every day  they gotta put a new door in  cause she leaves  just crashing through it. 
[01:39:00]  Take that,  you nobody in radio.  What's worse than being  a six foot four  with giant teeth  and a woman?  That's terrible.  Look at the real women  next to her.  There's a picture  of her in the middle  with two real women  who actually are attractive,  have nice bodies  and everything.  And she is just  this giant beast.  She has the right  fucking height  and tooth proportions  if she's fucking  like pulling  a Budweiser cart  in a winter commercial. 
[01:39:30]  That's what happens  when she walks around.  Bam, bam, bam, bam.  Da-na-na-na-na-na.  Oh, her Clydesdale  fucking qualities  are really enraging.  So,  E-Rock was so excited.  He's never heard a show  take our advice  more than this Mickey guy.  Right.  Like, all of a sudden  he's like blowing her off.  We'd ruin the chemistry  within two days  of this radio show.  But obviously  there had to be  a problem before that  but they just tolerated her.  Sure.  And no one really noticed it  because it hadn't  been pointed out. 
[01:40:00]  Now that it's been  pointed out,  they're all like,  oh my god,  she does just  fucking babble  or interrupt us  when we're in the middle  of doing something.  And now the listeners,  if they listen to their show,  listen and go,  oh my god,  she's worthless.  She's fucking worthless.  So,  here's a great example  of Mickey just completely  taking our advice.  Like Ant was saying,  showing that she's worthless.  It was just so funny  to hear  like how it evolved.  Like,  originally they were all,  they thought I went on  and trashed them.  Right. 
[01:40:30]  Which I didn't.  But that's their MO.  They love picking radio fights.  No, but listen,  we'll talk about them.  But by the end of their show,  they,  they like,  they liked our show.  Right.  They just,  they just went off  on Amelia.  And I was like,  I was like,  wow,  like it was so hilarious  at times.  Well,  I mean,  like I said,  that's what they do.  They,  they bash women.  They're a men's locker room show,  which,  you know,  there's definitely a place  for that in,  in radio.  We kind of do some of that.  Isn't that kind of  what we're doing?  Well,  yeah,  except for you guys  actually let a woman in, 
[01:41:00]  which is kind of refreshing.  Josh,  do you have a song  or anything  you'd like to take us out with?  I don't know if you're a big fan  of the music.  I've had  the time of my life.  See,  the guy,  the guy actually took our advice  and went,  wow.  Good for him.  I like this guy.  I'm making a point  that I can understand.  That monolith,  she was hoping he'd play  fucking Helen Reddy.  She actually thought,  I am Dino,  hear me roar.  She actually was trying to say  they do locker room stuff, 
[01:41:30]  but we do something different here.  And Mickey knows  he's doing locker room stuff.  But you allow a woman to,  and you know something,  we really don't.  We were forced to.  If I didn't know,  he was the one by the demo tape.  Yeah,  this gentleman sounds good.  Okay.  He probably played  Center for the Liberty.  No,  he's fine.  I thought he was hiring  Tag to do sports.  He was.  How great is that?  Fantastic.  We fucked up her world.  I mean,  it's not going to be the same.  It's just a matter of time now.  Should I have more photos  of her big shoulders,  please?  Yeah,  I got to see that. 
[01:42:00]  She's terrific,  this one.  She's a giant.  Yeah.  And it leads to this bit,  manhole.  The manhole.  The manhole.  What is this,  Sam?  A bunch of what?  Women doing kind of  locker room stuff?  Well,  Troy Kwan came up  with the idea,  and then...  Oh,  the Troy Kwan!  Troy Kwan,  and then Steve C.  and I helped him pen it.  Yeah,  it's a station promo  for the brand new channel  on Sirius XM,  which is all guy talk,  but done by funny women. 
[01:42:30]  Ah!  Why didn't Ant and I  write a little something  for this,  Sam?  Oh,  right.  You guys were,  I mean,  you guys are already  headed out by that point.  Oh,  really?  Was it 10 o'clock?  Yeah.  I have a little experience,  you know,  with the radio.  I could have wrote  some stuff for you.  I mean,  it would have been  a huge house.  It really would have  been great.  You know how much time,  you know how much material  we can write  in the time it takes  an elevator to go 36 floors?  Oh,  could we write material?  Next time you follow us out 
[01:43:00]  and we'll write down  some of our genius for you.  And then you go back upstairs  and throw it in there.  And sometimes  the elevator stops  at a floor  and doesn't make it  all the way down  to the lobby  without stopping  and that's extra time  to write.  Sometimes we actually  have to wait  for our cars too.  Wow.  Sometimes.  Now by write out,  you mean dictate  and then I would write it out,  I would assume.  Yeah,  we're not.  Oh,  I don't write any.  What,  pen to paper?  Stop it.  I don't remember  the last time  I actually wrote anything.  Wrote a bit?  Remember I used to save them? 
[01:43:30]  Yeah.  Oh,  now they're all yellowed  and cracked around the edge  like Civil War documents.  I think  there's old Barney bits  that look like  Civil War documents.  Barney,  remember that?  Of course.  That's what I used to write.  I'd go into the studio  and record it and everything.  Oh my God,  the good old days.  Let me see how...  See,  they don't do anything anymore.  I'm doing it.  Tap.  All right,  so let's take a listen to this.  It's produced by Little Mickey.  I tapped out,  though.  What is this about again? 
[01:44:00]  It's the thing.  The premise...  There was a premise  that you guys discussed yesterday.  Ah.  Premise,  which was girls  doing guy talk.  And the channel names  would be kind of like  crazy,  outrageous,  like stuff,  right?  Okay,  I got you,  Sam.  Let's play this.  The new extreme  guy talk channel  for guys  by women.  It's the manhole.  All holes,  all the time.  Forget what you've heard.  All girl is funny.  Like the morning crew, 
[01:44:30]  Debbie and Susan  with Twat Talk.  Did you see  Lesnar's tibia  tear through his leg  last night  on the UFC fight?  Yeah,  that was cool,  but wouldn't it have been better  to just talk out  their problems?  Yeah,  you're right.  They probably have  a lot in common.  Stay tuned  for middays.  Alice and Betsy  give their take  on what guys  are talking about  on Shatter Cunts.  Do you think  Mitch Hedberg  could have been  the next Bill Hicks?  Who's Bill Hicks?  A comedian,  you know,  like Margaret Cho.  Oh,  that sounds funny.  Then,  listen to Rita and Luanda 
[01:45:00]  in the Labial Lounge  as they get down  with today's  hottest porn stars.  Hey, guys,  so we have  Taya Parker in today.  Ooh,  what do you want  to do with her?  We should find out  what kind of clothes  porn stars wear.  Oh,  I hope she's wearing  underwear today.  Then,  end your days right  with the night crew  Beatrice and Wanda  on Clit Commandos.  And watch out,  you never know  when Roy  might stop by the studio  for wacky shenanigans.  Have you ever parked  in a handicapped spot 
[01:45:30]  without a sticker?  Yeah,  I did once.  I felt like such an outlaw.  Will you two whores  shut the fuck up  and suck my dick?  Oh,  Roy.  Yeah.  That's right.  That's the manhole.  All hole.  All the time.  Available now  at Sirius 505  XM 400.  Special radio required.  Special radio required.  I kind of like it,  Sam.  Yeah.  Can you guys take a,  like,  this is going to be,  Steve just wrote  one little part.  Yeah,  I wonder what that was. 
[01:46:00]  Can you take a wild guess  which part Steve had?  Was it toward the end?  It was.  The rape scenario,  basically.  Yeah.  I like it.  Yeah.  The first two of their acting  was horrendous.  They were just reading their lines.  But the rest of the girls  really got into their parts.  Well,  the thing is,  we wanted to do it  yesterday afternoon  so not all of these women  are,  like,  voiceover talent.  Some work in sales,  some work,  they're just women  with women voices  so we threw them in a booth.  Oh,  is that what it is?  So not actresses?  We needed eight women.  Which part did Travis play? 
[01:46:30]  Travis was not asked to do  a woman voice  on this program.  Oh,  because he's a woman.  Right.  Yeah,  see.  Get it?  We should do more of these.  More chit-chat shows?  Yeah,  kind of like Manhole.  The channel name is Manhole.  The Manhole,  yeah.  With Jocktober coming up.  That's true.  Jocktober's right around the corner.  I'm already getting people  on my Twitter  sending me,  you have to do this show.  You have to do this.  Yeah,  yeah.  I love Jocktober. 
[01:47:00]  You know,  fall,  I'm not really a big fan of it.  I like summer stuff,  but Jocktober kind of makes up  for the fact that the weather's  not as warm anymore  and things like that.  I love Jocktober.  You're right.  I hope Stephen King's radio station  doesn't fall into the Jocktober category.  Stephen King's lame-o radio station.  What do you mean?  He has a radio station?  Oh,  he does.  He's got three.  Up in Bangor,  Maine,  and it's just,  what does he do?  Triple shot?  Yeah,  he's talking about radio,  and that's the column  that he wrote,  like the ticket,  Opie and Anthony. 
[01:47:30]  We're just mad  that he lumped us into  all the horse shit radio  that really is out there.  He would have made  a pretty good point  if he didn't just like,  you know,  put us at the top  of the horse shit radio category.  Well,  his station has  the Rock and Roll Morning Show,  so.  Yeah,  they have the Rock and Roll Morning Show,  so I guess Stephen King  understands radio.  Yeah,  he knows.  And what's their bit?  Well,  they may have a character  named Baxter the Pokemonster  who plays a polka song,  or who plays a rock song  on the accordion, 
[01:48:00]  and then you have to call up  and figure out what song  she's playing.  No.  No.  No!  A certain character  who a certain person  on this show  used to play in his heyday,  very,  very similar to Baxter.  Spuds Buckley.  I,  I,  Baxter is very  Spuds-ish.  We can't wait for Jacktober.  The Stephen King thing  is hot right now.  Get me that audio  for tomorrow.  He,  he,  he owns the station? 
[01:48:30]  It's called Stephen King's,  like,  that's the tagline  of the station  if you go to the website.  It's like Stephen King's  Rock Station.  Are they all mummies  that work there?  These are cobwebs  and candelabras.  It's macabre.  Radio macabre-y.  Yuck.  What is it on the dial?  Is it  66.6?  Oh,  damn,  yo.  He's a demon.  Yeah.  I do love his writing. 
[01:49:00]  The guy has written  some of the best books ever,  but who gives a shit  what he thinks elsewhere?  And look,  you know,  I think we're mad too  because it's obvious  he's really never heard the show.  He's just,  it's hearsay.  Well,  maybe he googled us  to get a quick little  idea of what we do.  Whatever.  I don't know.  I don't,  I don't appreciate it.  He likes his cornball radio.  That's what he likes.  Well,  you know something?  If you like cornball radio,  don't start talking about  other shows  and things like,  like,  you then have a relative, 
[01:49:30]  relevant opinion of radio.  What does he know?  He doesn't.  All he knows is ghosts  and goblins and such.  very frightening.  Scary stuff.  Ooh,  I like my radio host  to have satin pillows  and coffins.  Sure you do.  Sure you do.  It's very creepy.  It's very creepy.  Very scary guy.  The bus incident.  I don't have that audio.  Oh my God,  get it.  The coffee really  fucked up everything.  I don't know  where our shit is.  Mars must have done  something with it.  You know,  that audio,  I want to hear it 
[01:50:00]  because I saw this story  and was  infuriated  at the reaction  this story is getting  or the lack thereof,  may I say.  Well,  what's the details  on that,  Ant?  Well,  I'd like to say it  in my own words,  but  we know that's impossible.  I'll punch it up  on  this.  White student  beaten on school bus  crowd cheers. 
[01:50:30]  That's on drudge.  Yeah,  this is on drudge.  Here's a video grab.  One student  attacking another  while the bus  ride to  Belleville West  High School  on Monday.  Boy,  that Belleville West  High School  looks like a great  place to send  your white kid.  How about  your fucking move,  you dumb  liberal-minded ass?  Your kid's just  going to be  fucked up  for the rest  of his life.  How many kids  are beating  this kid up?  Two,  one of which  might have 
[01:51:00]  in the wildest  stretch of the  imagination  actually had  some kind of  reason.  He moved  his book bag.  See,  this kid gets  on the school bus.  I'll just lay it  out for you.  This poor  white kid  gets on the  school bus  and is walking  down a little  school bus aisle  like he does  every day  and tries to  get a seat  and no one  wants him to  sit down.  Of course not.  I'm looking at  a school bus  full of black  people and  I see maybe  a Hispanic  and I see  a white person. 
[01:51:30]  Be careful.  What?  Oh, no,  that's what I'm  saying.  You're in the  media.  You can't be  that descriptive.  No, I'm not  in the media.  We're all like  the same person  as far as  the media goes.  No, no,  you're only  descriptive if  it's a white  perpetrator.  Then you'd be  descriptive.  So he's  walking in there.  They won't let  him sit down.  The bus  starts rolling.  He sees  a kid sitting  in a seat  with a backpack  or something,  book bag,  next to him.  So he slides it  over a little  bit and sits  in the seat.  Well, this  gentleman did 
[01:52:00]  not like that  the kid slid  his book bag  over and sat  down.  So he just  started punching  him in the  face multiple  times as hard  as he can,  much to the  joy of the  rest of the  students on  the bus.  There's a  certain website  that I go to  that has a  term for what  they were doing  on the bus  when they all  go like,  yeah,  yeah,  and just start  screaming and  stuff.  Is it called  fisticuffs?  No,  no,  no,  no.  It's a great,  funny, 
[01:52:30]  very descriptive  word,  but I'll leave  that alone.  If you know  what I'm talking  about,  research it  yourself.  What's it  rhyme with?  Hmm?  Nothing good.  Oh,  it rhymes with  gimping out.  Jesus.  You know,  like you would  limp.  You would  limp off your  bus.  I was  wimping out?  Yeah.  I was way  off.  Really?  No,  no,  no.  I was way  off.  So,  there's some  prime examples  to a video  where it's  like uncanny. 
[01:53:00]  What the  fuck?  Yeah.  So,  this kid is  getting the  shit beat out  of him.  Yep.  And he's  sitting there  and then,  I guess the  fight stops.  He sits  down and  tries to  recoup from  his beating.  And then  another gentleman  just decides to  get up,  come over,  and join in  the fun and  hijinks that  some of these  people think  is fun.  And out of  nowhere just  starts punching  him in the  face and  beating the  shit out of  him.  And the  bus driver,  thank God, 
[01:53:30]  looked in  that mirror  above his  head and  said,  hey,  sit down.  It's being  called bullying,  though.  Yeah,  yeah,  of course,  it's bullying.  Reverse this,  by the way.  It is a race  crime,  a hate  crime.  It is a  racist event.  Oh,  my God,  a bus full  of privileged  white students  beat up a  poor African  American child  just trying to  get an  education.  That's what  it would be.  And Reverend  Al?  This is just  bullying.  Reverend Al  would be  involved.  Outraged.  He would  be involved,  right?  He would  be involved, 
[01:54:00]  it would  be outraged.  All the  white students  laughing and  cheering on a  black student  being beaten  by two white  students.  How could  this happen  in our society?  It's crazy.  But when it's  a white kid  getting beaten by  two black  kids on  a bus full  of black  people that  are laughing  and cheering,  it's just  called bullying.  White people  will not  accuse anybody  who isn't  white of a 
[01:54:30]  racial motivation  of any sort.  Yeah.  There's times  where it's  going to be  just bullying.  Two black  guys believe  they should have  a white kid  and it's just  bullying.  But it's like  they refuse  to even  acknowledge  that it  could be  that and  yet when  the reverse  happens,  their knee  jerk reaction  is so  immediate and  so quick  to assume  that it's  a racially  motivated thing  against a  black guy.  It's amazing.  What's  self-flagellation  by people?  This poor  kid has to  get on this  bus every  day.  He probably  looks and  feels like  that guy 
[01:55:00]  in Gladiator  that pissed  his pants  before the  doors opened  up.  Remember that  guy?  He's chained  to the  big  German  guy?  He's  just like  that's  probably  how he  felt  every  day  getting  on  this  bus.  Oh  fuck.  Oh  shit.  You say  this poor  kid,  you know,  the father  should have  done better  in school.  Yeah,  yeah.  Why  do they  let this  kid get  on this  fucking  school bus?  First  of all,  I hope 
[01:55:30]  it isn't  because the  parents are  so liberal  that they  think that  well,  you know,  it's just  we can't  let these  racial  stereotypes  interfere with  you're going  to raise  a fucking  lunatic.  They're  probably  poor.  Yes,  because most  liberals  would send  their kid  to a private  school,  but then  preach to  you how  you should  live your  life.  Yeah,  well,  that's  true.  Okay.  They  wouldn't  lead by  example  with their  own  children. 
[01:56:00]  They  would  preach  to  you  while  doing  what  they  felt  was  best  for  their  kid.  Well,  here's  how the  news reported  it.  All right,  let's  hear how  the  you just  reported  perfectly  very  descriptive  more than  perfectly  perfectly  though.  I mean,  you  described it  perfectly.  I described  exactly what  happened.  But if  you're just  like Joe  listener out  there listening  to just  bland media,  this is how  it's reported.  A camera  catches a  school bus  beating in  Illinois.  Take a look.  A 17-year-old  student is  attacked on  the high 
[01:56:30]  school bus  Monday,  not once,  but twice.  It apparently  starts when he  sits down where  he's not  wanted.  The boy  next to him  starts exchanging  words,  then throwing  punches.  That attack  stops.  But then another  student takes  it up.  The 14- and 15-year-old  attackers have both  been suspended.  They may also face  some criminal charges.  The victim is  okay.  Wow.  I hate to see  that.  Yeah.  Terrible.  You hate to see  that, but why  don't you explain  what's going on  in this country? 
[01:57:00]  That's a black-white  thing right there.  If it was the  other way around,  you would hear  that anchor going,  there is an  investigation underway  that charges of  hate crime might be  levied against the  students that gave  the child the  beating.  I mean,  it just,  the double standard  is ridiculous.  I know I love  how black people  say live with it.  I say go fuck  yourself.  I think Whitey  ought to come  around and not 
[01:57:30]  sit here and be  a victim like  this.  This poor  fucking  motherfucker.  You know,  I don't know.  He might be an  asshole.  Someone is saying  you're just wrong.  We got to go to  Jared in Philly.  Jared.  Jared.  Guys, I have a  question for  Anthony, actually.  Anthony, you're  race-beating right  now.  Kids are assholes.  Yeah.  I saw the video.  Look in the front  right.  There's a curly-haired,  fat white boy.  Did you see that  in the video?  Yeah, I see.  I see.  Yeah.  There's blandly  other white people  in the bus. 
[01:58:00]  It's a kid walking  in the back of the  bus.  Just some kids being  assholes in the back.  He didn't move the  bag.  They got in a fight.  But, Jared, hold on.  The thing that, even if  you're right, even if you  are, because that very  is possibly what  happened, the thing  that's annoying is  simply the way the  media refuses to raise  the possibility, whereas  when the reverse  happens, they absolutely  do.  It's like somebody  hung a noose outside  of some black  professors at  Columbia, and  immediately, it was  front-page newspaper  coverage here in 
[01:58:30]  New York.  So it's just simply  the way it's reported,  but you might be  right.  So, Jared, take away  the argument at all  that this is a racially  based beating, and  just say it's a bunch  of fucking kids  getting into a fight  just like they do  any other day.  What if it's turned  around?  Do you see any  difference if it's  turned around in the  way this is covered  in the news?  Possibly.  No, shut up, don't  be dishonest, possibly.  I'm not.  I'm so fucking 
[01:59:00]  lutely would this be  called some type of,  or at least be  investigated as a  hate crime.  You need to channel  your hate somewhere  else, Jesus Christ.  No, I do.  I'm not beating up  fucking black people  on school buses.  I need to channel  my hate.  Maybe other people  need to channel  their fucking hate.  Not me, pal.  How does this affect  you personally?  How does it affect  me personally?  Because white people  are fucking  professional victims. 
[01:59:30]  Professional victims.  And black people  are getting away  with it in droves  because they can  fucking just say  racist and everything  gets wiped off  the fucking table.  If this was reversed,  this fucking thing  would be a race crime.  Okay.  I did call to get  you riled up a little  bit.  Well, it works.  Thank you.  Good for you.  You act like you're  influenced by these  situations on a  consistent basis.  You aren't.  You have no touch 
[02:00:00]  in this.  You're wrong, Jared.  You're wrong.  You're wrong.  First of all, I live  in fucking New York.  I work in New York  City, which is very  ethnically diverse,  my friend.  And when I'm walking  the streets at night  occasionally.  Very occasionally.  What's wrong with you?  You live in a bubble.  Hey, no.  Tell you the truth.  In and out of the city,  there's always glass  around you.  There's been instances,  yes, and metal.  There's been instances  where I've walked  around in Times Square  and lately, Times Square,  it's getting a little 
[02:00:30]  different.  It's kind of switched.  Well, at night,  they got some issues.  Yeah, yeah.  Some shady gang issues.  Things going on over there.  And I ain't picking sides.  I was standing on the corner.  Which way is north?  Which way is north?  Some guy comes up to me.  Black guy comes up.  First, he's talking  with three other black guys.  And they're looking at me.  And then one of them  walks over and says,  yo, man, you got the time?  And I looked at him 
[02:01:00]  and I went, no.  I don't have the fucking time.  You swore on the time?  No.  Dude, they were ready  to fuck me up.  And I don't even,  I'm not shitting you.  I'm fucking,  I'm not stupid.  I'm not going to,  I'm not going to squash  my instincts  because I don't want  to come off  like I'm fucking racist.  I knew  they were fucking stalking me.  They were,  they were looking at me going,  here's a fucking victim.  Let me go up.  I could see the pack  looking. 
[02:01:30]  Maybe they just  wanted to go to a movie.  They know the movie  started at 1030  and they just want to know  what the time was.  All right, look, you.  Perhaps the library  was closing  and they had a book  over to you.  Anthony, what's wrong with you?  Are you asshole?  They didn't want to miss  their movie  and they weren't sure  what time it was.  That's all.  It was a,  it was a,  it was obvious.  Very obvious.  Because sometimes  you're not sure.  There was going to be trouble.  Right.  There was going to be  fucking trouble.  And then I continued  walking into where  there were more people.  More white people.  Well, more people.  I don't give a shit. 
[02:02:00]  You know.  And I knew  that something was up there.  The way they looked  at me,  the way the guy came over,  he was a little tentative.  He was looking around.  When he came up,  you've got to identify  this shit  or you're going to end up  going which way is north  and be in the hospital.  And you got back  to the herd, I see.  Yeah, yeah.  See?  I got back.  Yeah.  I went off to the watering hole.  By yourself.  That was dumb.  I limped over to the watering hole.  Saw them come and went,  oh, I've got to get back  to the herd.  Oopsie.  That looks like a... 
[02:02:30]  I have a better shot if...  That looks like a snalagaster  coming up to me.  Oh, no.  Aye, nigh.  Aye, nigh.  Anthony, aye, nigh.  Is Jared still here?  Jared.  Jared.  The guy?  The caller?  Oh, no, no.  Here's the caller there.  Because he asked how it  affects Anthony personally.  Here's how it affects  us personally as a group.  We're in the media  and because there's  this tendency  to report it one way,  it's borderline sociopathic  the way they are so 
[02:03:00]  against reporting it  back and forth.  So as a radio host,  if you say something  fucked up,  you know exactly  how it's going to be reported.  And since they report it  so out of balance,  it just looks,  oh, my God,  they said something racist.  It isn't racist.  Whereas they don't report  on the same way  if Black Show says something.  Right.  It's a very unbalanced  way of handling it  so your ass is on the line  more if you say  something stupid.  It does make a difference,  man,  because the culture,  that's the way we're going.  It affects me  because it affects, 
[02:03:30]  yeah,  the culture.  It affects  white America,  which is part of society  just as black America is.  There's definitely  a difference.  There is a separation  between the races,  which,  although it's not  the same separation  that there was  back in the,  you know,  20s and 30s and 40s.  It is a different  type of separation.  No less of a chasm,  though,  I got to say.  It's an amazing separation 
[02:04:00]  between blacks and whites  in this country today.  Our opinions  are completely different  for the most part.  I think,  I think  youth  always has  a little more cohesion  with each other,  but as,  as,  even as they grow older,  you get a little  more separatism  going on.  And that's  what's happening.  But the thing is,  with the separatism,  whites are  victims.  Whites are  victims  in this country. 
[02:04:30]  And  a lot of the  crime  we're victim to  is done  by minorities.  I absolutely  know  white people  kill people.  White people kill  a lot of fucking people.  That Asian student,  you know,  the person of interest,  this is one of these  typical,  I mean,  you could profile  this motherfucker  from a textbook  killer.  But he was white.  Rapist killer or whatever.  He was Asian.  What?  Was the guy,  I thought he was a white guy.  I saw him.  He looked white to me.  Yeah, see?  Wait a minute.  What?  No, I have no idea. 
[02:05:00]  No, he's a white guy.  No, I know.  Yeah, he's a white guy.  Sandler.  Huh?  He looks like Adam Sandler.  Oh, the yell guy?  Yeah, the yell guy.  But it's one of these  positions where it's like,  it affects me  because, you know,  I'm part of the society  that is being  victimized  of the modern age  and not  victimized  of the modern age  and not able  to really voice it  in numbers.  You're voicing it  in numbers.  Yeah, not really, though.  We can't say anything. 
[02:05:30]  The news doesn't report it  like Jimmy was just saying.  The double standard  between hate crimes  as far as blacks  and whites go  is,  it isn't even  a double standard  because there would  have to be  some other standard  for there to be  a double standard.  It's just,  it's a single standard.  Just white people  get accused of it.  And the phones,  we gotta go here.  Brett in Chicago.  Brett.  Hey, guys.  Love you,  love your show.  Thank you, Brett.  Yeah, I know.  Just let you know  that, you know,  Chicago,  that part of area 
[02:06:00]  of Chicago,  it's...  Baddest part of town.  It's the rest of Chicago  and basically  the white people  that still live there,  because they still live there  because they live downtown  or they work downtown  and the white kids,  they have no choice  but to have to get along,  try to get along.  I mean,  this happens all the time  and the news  doesn't report as much.  You see it in like  the small blogs  that they put in  in the newspapers  in the area,  but, you know,  it just does happen  all the time.  You know,  it's probably about 80%  black people 
[02:06:30]  that live there  and, you know,  these poor white people,  they're just trying  to live there too  and mix in  and, but, you know,  this is the shit  they've got to put up with  over and over and over again.  Yeah, there's...  It's amazing  the racism that goes on  in the black community  that is just not acknowledged.  And it's more overt  than in the white community.  Absolutely.  If white people are racist,  it's a lot more covert,  a lot more underhanded,  a lot more, you know...  Sneakier.  Sneaky.  More bullshit.  Right.  Blacks are more...  They're more honest about it. 
[02:07:00]  But it's not reported,  it's not fucking acknowledged  that black people  can even be racist  against white people  and that it's shown  and it's on a daily basis  and a lot of crime  is based on race  but they will never acknowledge it.  They'll say it's robbery,  it's this, it's that,  it's the other thing.  Never say,  this person was picked  and assaulted  because of his race  and the black person  is the perpetrator.  You just don't hear it.  White people have become  a bunch of fucking sneaks.  I mean, maybe... 
[02:07:30]  And I mean just really sneaks  and fucking...  You know, Patrice always talks  about that hidden racism.  Yep.  But it really does exist  and it's like...  And I mean that without...  There's no sarcasm.  Black people are more honest about it.  If they're annoyed racially,  they say it.  Yeah.  White people don't.  White people lie.  No, no.  Lie.  I'm not racist.  It's so silly.  There's no racial animosity  toward anyone.  I don't take a stereotype  and have a preconceived notion  when I'm in a certain situation.  But you know what?  You should. 
[02:08:00]  You should at times.  At times you should absolutely  take a stereotype  and use it  because it might save your life.  I love people that think,  you know,  hey, I'm just going to be  a do-gooder  or I'm going to  not  take  maybe an extra little  precautionary measure  and they wind up  just getting fucked over.  A do-gooder.  You sounded like  you were one of the  Scooby-Doo villains.  You do-gooders. 
[02:08:30]  They always would fuck up a crime.  Let's go to Steve.  Steve,  you're on the O.P. and Anthony show.  I'm a gay gentleman  and...  Yes.  I'm sorry.  Go ahead.  Oh, go ahead.  No, it's your show.  Go ahead, Steve.  I'm from there.  I went to Belleville West  and it's un-fucking-believable  what's happened in that town  in the last 10 years.  You see a white  suburban community  of St. Louis  and then all the  other people  moved up the hill  into Belleville  and it's an effort 
[02:09:00]  to drive  Whitey out of the town  and what's happened there  has probably happened  a dozen times  over the past couple years  is that they're just  beating the hell  out of the white kids  and Belleville,  used to be a great town  but I guess like a lot  of places  it's just gone  to hell in a handbasket  and it's un-fucking-believable  that a nice place  has turned into this.  You know what happens also...  I don't live there anymore.  You know what happens also  in the news?  If you get a black gentleman 
[02:09:30]  that walks into a  predominantly white neighborhood  and gets assaulted  by some guido  or whatever the fuck  is going on  it will absolutely  be reported  as a race crime  it will be a hate crime  the man will be arrested  and then there'll be  outrage as to why  this black gentleman  could not go into  this neighborhood  and why he was assaulted.  You get a white guy  go into a black neighborhood  regardless of the reason  to buy drugs  whatever he's doing  and he gets assaulted  you won't even hear about it. 
[02:10:00]  You won't even hear about it.  Never mind  that he was chosen  and beaten  because he was white.  I mean you just  won't hear about it.  Because elitist whites  their thinking is  you ought to know better  than to go...  They would never dare  voice that  but their thing...  Why is the white guy there?  Exactly.  Why would you go  into that neighborhood?  They don't say it.  That's the arrogance  in that really covert racism  that again  the media displays  are not reporting  racial crimes equally. 
[02:10:30]  It's almost like  they feel that  when white people  do something  we should be held  to a higher standard  intellectually  or emotionally  or motivationally  than blacks should.  And there's such  a fucking condescending  racism in that.  Like to think that  if you walk into  a white neighborhood  well we're civilized  you should be able to.  Well that guy  walked into 145th Street  and got jumped.  They won't report that  because they're thinking  as well you know  it's 145th Street  what you expect.  It's the guy's fault.  Why did he go there?  And the...  Oh I had another  great point. 
[02:11:00]  Which just went  out of my head.  You want to move  to Iowa and get married?  That was it.  That was it.  No it was  something to do with  especially New York City  and the diversity  in our town  but how it...  I'll quit while  I'm way behind.  I'll take it over.  Rich in Jacksonville.  Rich.  Hey guys  I get sick and tired  of these stupid idiots  from on your show  whenever there's something  they want  these white guys  want to defend  what's going on 
[02:11:30]  these black people  when they don't know.  I'm down here  in the south  and we have public schools  and it's mostly blacks  then over the whites  and we get along fine  but if you ask  the black people  down here  we get along  they'll tell you  that that bus incident  was racial  and I get sick and tired  they see these white people  think that Barack Obama  is a black man.  Barack Obama  is whiter than I am.  You know there's no such thing  as a black man  whose favorite group  is or singer  is Bob Seeker. 
[02:12:00]  So that's who they think  a freaking black man is  and they just can't understand  how white he's going to be  so mean  when we actually  get along down here  and you know  we have black head coaches  in football  and boy  we win state championships  and nobody gets a shit.  So all you white listeners  out there  that are damn liberal  you shut the fuck up  whenever we talk  about this stuff  because you don't know  what the fuck's going on.  Wow.  Look at Rich in Jacksonville.  Obama's favorite singer 
[02:12:30]  is Bob Seeker  is that true?  Well that's what they asked  and they said  who's your favorite singer  he's like Bob Seeker.  Holy shit.  I don't remember hearing that.  You're lucky black people  didn't know that  they never would have heard of him.  Oh my god  are you kidding me?  Bob Seeker.  Did you know that?  No.  Maybe he used to dance around  in his underwear.  I would have thought  he'd say  like Tom Cruise.  I should have asked him yesterday.  Oh right.  Hollywood Jimmy. 
[02:13:00]  I'm just giving you props  on your Lenovo appearance.  Oh is it?  That's coming in.  Oh nice.  Mark in Milwaukee.  Mark.  Good morning all day.  Hey buddy.  Welcome home.  Welcome home Jimmy.  Thank you sweet potato.  Hey um  my local news  pixelated the white kid.  I didn't even know  he was white  but you guys just mentioned it.  Well they pixelated him  because he's underage.  Yeah but you can't tell  what he looks like.  Which is kind of interesting  that they pixelated him  because he's underage  but all the black students  weren't pixelated.  How old are these  high school students? 
[02:13:30]  God damn it.  I have no idea.  What the fuck?  Thank you gentlemen.  Just an observation.  Yeah we're good at observations.  Let me say hi to Jason in Texas.  Jason.  Hey I just want to say  little Jimmy welcome back  but listen.  Thanks a big million.  You said something before man  that was a little weird.  You said that white people  are underhanded  about their racial epithets  and what not.  No no not epithets  but about their racism 
[02:14:00]  meaning that when a guy  elitist racism  like when a guy  will not call a black person  out on certain things  because deep down  he feels intellectually superior  to that guy.  He feels better than that guy.  He feels like he holds  other white people  to a higher intellectual standard.  To me that's a very sneaky  covert kind of racism.  It's parental.  It's disgusting.  It's not saying  hey look you're a guy  I'm a guy  I'm going to hold you  to the same thought process 
[02:14:30]  I hold myself to.  That's not seeing a person  as an equal intellectually.  I understand what you're saying  but the problem is  is that every time  we try to bring it up  and every time we try  to call somebody out on it  Al Sharpton  the N-double-A-C-T  everybody's all  jumping all over us  but God forbid  some white guy  comes down and says  listen  this kid should not  have gotten beat  by two black kids  raise it up  speak something about it  nobody will do it  because everybody's afraid  there's going to be  another watch.  The problem is not  Al Sharpton dude 
[02:15:00]  Al Sharpton  does what he does  he's a blabbermouth  the man's a horse's ass  Al Sharpton  does not fire people  the N-double-A-C-P  does not fire people  they just raise issues  some very legitimate  and some are bullshit  and white executives  who are probably  so out of touch  racially  have no way  to distinguish  between what's legitimate  and what's a nonsensical  racial claim  because they're so  fucking out of the loop  because white people  have been put  they've been put  in this position  where they're so afraid 
[02:15:30]  to say anything  and we don't get  the opportunity  to rise up and see  who put white people there  white people did  exactly  and it's embarrassing  it's fucking infuriating  to watch  because I would love  to see more white people  speaking their minds  about being called racist  when you criticize  this president  as a matter of fact  if you criticize Obama  you're a racist  you criticize Bush  you were the greatest  fucking person in the world  every Hollywood 
[02:16:00]  elitist douchebag  was criticizing Bush  yay  everybody starts clapping  you criticize this president  you're a fucking racist  no matter what  your criticism is  the minute we start  bringing stuff up  everybody goes back  to Africa  and goes back to this  and you want to talk  about this  talk about how  we were brought over here  against our rights  you know what  there's a million other races  and a million other people  that were against their rights  but nobody brings it up  all the time  like these people do  on a constant constant basis  there's a cultural chasm  between black and white 
[02:16:30]  there is a cultural difference  that is very hard  for whites and blacks  to assimilate  to like  to  and I'm being general  here  believe me  I know there are  the Maxwell House  coffee commercial  black families too  believe me  I watch the commercials  and I go  see  that's nice  but I know that exists  I know that  when I watch a commercial  for Pictionary  or something like that  I know that there's  white couples  that invite their black  and Asian friends  over to play the game 
[02:17:00]  and they have fun together  I know that exists  but I'm generalizing  I'm pretty much saying  there's a cultural difference  which makes it  I think more difficult  for white people  and black people  to  really get along  without  without having to  really kind of  let me say  stray from your  your  your culture  or stray from  what you're comfortable with  like  I couldn't possibly  go over to 
[02:17:30]  let's say  Shade 45  sit down  and have a conversation  with them  and sound  like  and not sound like  a complete idiot  really  yes  I have no  I would sound like  an idiot  because I really don't  I'm not familiar  enough with the culture  no I disagree  I think  you would  you'd find  it's  I guess  I hang out with comics  yeah yeah yeah  it's completely  it's hard to go to  like a black radio station  when I'm on the road  just all of a sudden  be funny  but maybe that's my own  hang up  it's like 
[02:18:00]  if you wanted to talk  about gun control  or any other social issue  you can sit there  and fucking  talk about it  it would be the white guy  talking about gun control  to a bunch of black guys  interviewing me  or talking to me  it's a weird  cultural thing  that  that is  very hard to understand  you ever watch  club footage  from a black club  I think you might  Dudley Moore  club footage  from a black club  predominantly black club 
[02:18:30]  and club footage  from like a white club  the cultural difference  between everything  the conversations  the dancing  the fucking way  you're dressed  the way you  you walk  talk  it's so different  than it is  if you know  that I think  it's very hard  to reach a common  common ground  I could walk  right into shade  45 right now  and I could go  hey guys  let's have a gab session 
[02:19:00]  see  that's a hip hop  lingo  by the way though  you are an exception  to the rule  because of your  background in comedy  you can do that  you've walked  into clubs  you've done black shows  you just  believe  no no no  that's where  the cultural difference  is obvious  when it's become  it's like  I don't like doing  ethnic shows  black  Spanish  Asian  I don't like doing  any ethnic shows  or gender based shows  doesn't that tell you  that there is a difference  oh there absolutely  people don't acknowledge  that there's a difference  between cultures  and races 
[02:19:30]  there's a big difference  and sometimes  let me go way out  on a limb here  sometimes  they don't cross over  it's very difficult  for one culture  to participate  in another culture's  way of life  but people don't  want to acknowledge that  everyone's the same  we're all one  we all bleed red  and this one can get  along with this one  no matter what  it's like no  there are cultural  differences 
[02:20:00]  that keep us apart  I truly  fucking believe that  yeah a lot of people  don't want to acknowledge  that just where you're  raised does go into  I mean look  why does every Italian  from Brooklyn  talk the same  it's a cultural thing  from being raised  in Brooklyn  exactly  and it's okay  to say that  but if you say  one of these  job rules  job rules  from fucking  Brooklyn  you're gonna  it's one of those  things where it's like  you can't just go in  there and start  relating to these  guys sitting  talking 
[02:20:30]  going  hey you cuck  you're gonna  seem out of place  as much as you will  trying to fucking  sit down and talk  to a bunch of guys  shooting dice  in Harlem  you know  it's like  hey stop  shooting  do they shoot  dice in Harlem  still shooting  dice in Harlem  I'm going back  to what I know  from the 70's TV  shows like  Beretta  let's go to  Tommy  a black guy  in Jacksonville  important for the  discussion obviously  what's up Tommy  hey man  I really agree  with Anthony 
[02:21:00]  but damn it  he's on the money  oh thank you sir  yes you're beautiful  man  but look  this whole  argument is because  neither side  is being really  honest about  bingo  he's right  I mean  black people  are like  hey you know  we deserve  reparation  you know  look what  happened to us  you know  I'm like  you know what  get off your ass  go to work  do something  productive  and I guarantee 
[02:21:30]  you  if you just  emulate  a successful  white or black  person  you will be  successful  there you go  plain and simple  exactly  you know  and just stay  out of the ghetto  it's bad there  it's bad there  it's bad there  I don't like  that I'm black  it's bad there  so I agree  with you man  you guys are  awesome  I love your show  thank you Tommy  this is a very  good point  coming in from  Steven PA  Steve what's up 
[02:22:00]  I was just  wondering how  you guys can  sit around  have this  conversation  by the way  welcome back  Jimmy  thanks a million  mister  when you just  spent five  minutes with  Hitler  that was our  segment called  five minutes  with Hitler  by the way  Hitler crashed  our show  he wasn't  invited  Hitler actually  much like  Poland  Hitler just  came marching  in  and took over  our show  and our  hiney still  hurt  we had to  liberate our  studio 
[02:22:30]  many lives  were long  I got so  nervous as  Fez dressed up  as Hitler  I spilled  coffee everywhere  I'm still  cleaning it up  by the way  it's everywhere  we're going  to take a  long break  in a few  minutes  oh thank  god  how long  I hope  24 hours  I'll do  the math  but it's  silly  you know  what I mean  I'll come  in tomorrow  but during  the long  break  go to my  YouTube  channel  OP radio  because I  got the  Fez video  up  it's horrific  look at the  crazy eyes  very closely  you want to  take more  calls on this 
[02:23:00]  subject  yeah let's  it seems  well this  guy is  begging  he's  Ray in  Arizona  he's got  Tourette's  Ray you  got the  Tourette's  poor filler  hey good  morning guys  or just  talk about  it  well I  still got  it but  it's very  modern  not like  that weirdo  Twitter  whatever  but I  was  my father  didn't make  much money  by the way  and I  spent 13  years in  all Baltimore  City public  schools  white kids  fat with  Tourette's  talk about  hell  that's hell 
[02:23:30]  okay  because that  is the worst  experience  anybody could  probably help  and the  black teachers  they didn't  care about  me getting  in fights  very much  they didn't  worry about  me  they weren't  there defending  me and  Al Sharpton  wasn't there  helping me  out either  yeah well  you know  everybody says  you know  where's Al  Sharpton  where's Al  Sharpton  and I'll  agree with  Jimmy on  this Al  Sharpton  just does  what Al  Sharpton  does  you can't  even blame  him  because he  identify and  know what he  is he's a  race baiter 
[02:24:00]  he's a  bandwagon jumper  an asshole  but he's  he's carved  himself out  a niche  and he knows  how to use  the power he  has to keep  his name in  the news  and keep  the money  rolling in  and keep  himself in  nice suits  without seemingly  having a job  you should become  the white  Al Sharpton  yeah yeah  there was  one guy  called that  his name was  David Duke  was one of  them  you don't  go with  the David Duke  thing  you use a  little more  intelligence  which you got  Anthony 
[02:24:30]  you can't  speak out  about this  for white  people  you gotta hold  like a little  press conference  when you're  a swarthy  mess like  I understand  you can't  you can't  speak for  white people  without being  I understand  it would be  a tough spot  but someone  has to step  up and do  it though  the spokesman  is Grease  Ballio  you know  what it is  it's fucking  like look  with CNN  with Jack  Cafferty  when all  those Asians  went crazy  and CNN  didn't buckle  and it went 
[02:25:00]  away  the New York  Post  fucking  sharp  where's  Sharpton's  protest  the post  they stood  tall  they refused  to fire  the artist  the cartoonist  Murdoch issued  an apology  smacked  Sharpton in the  face back  in the paper  and it  fucking  shut up  it went  away  so the  pussies  would stop  buckling  he would  just go  away  right  don't be  so eager  and easy  to just  cower  and just  fold  a little  more  gumption 
[02:25:30]  gumption  a little  more  stick-to-itiveness  say yeah  absolutely  that's right  I love using  those stupid  fucking words  especially while  I'm fucking  I like to say  when she's  jacking you off  and starts  slowing down  because her  arm is tired  hey  a little  more  stick-to-itiveness  that's right  you've got  some gumption  put some  elbow grease  into it  like if I'm  fucking her  she wakes up  and objects  I go  you've got  gumption  boo  boo  say gumption  again  let's take  a break  I have to

[02:29:30]  she had some cosmetic surgery  I believe  did she  at some point  yeah  with your spackle  put on her badge  you guys are giving me  the 411  and what about  the giant  the allegations  that she's a hermaphrodite  because there have been  photos of her  giant clitoris  I believe  no I thought  it was a cock  I thought  it seemed like  she had  you know  a bulge  a large bulge  Rich you can say  cock in our show  you can't say it  on Hits 1  no  no  say it a few more times  it just feels good  Rich  get it out  you ever notice  that black guys  say dick  they don't say cock

[02:30:30]  she looked like  a cabbage patch doll  when I worked  at fucking  Caldor  it was like 1986  ew  and Deirdre  was a big fat chick  from like Franklin  or like the projects  but she was really funny  and she kind of  talked like Snoop  like that  you know  man  that's slow talk  and she was talking  about like this guy  Joe who we knew  possibly eating her vagina  and she goes  look man  if he eat my honey  I'll suck his swank  swank  I'll suck his swank  it was the greatest  thing I've ever heard  what did you do 
[02:31:00]  at Caldor  I'm captivated now  you never saw my picture  of my employee  of the month  when I  20  employee of the month  for Caldor  or no employee of the week  where I got a $25 check  and I have my glasses  stop it  I need to see that picture  his horrendous glasses  I need to see this  I don't think I have it on here  to be honest with you  what did you do at Caldor  I was just like  I worked in shipping  and receiving  that's where I wrote  my first Stephen King book  was it  in 1987  I had just gotten sober  dude  me and you  have something in common 
[02:31:30]  shipping and receiving  for Xerox  in Rochester, New York  you're talking to the kid  shipping and receiving  Caldor  nothing out of business  a horseshit job  probably  long out of business  once Jimmy left the organization  just went to pot  I worked for Bill Caldor's outfit  yeah no I was  you got no merchandise in the box  well I'm sorry  I worked with her at Bradley's  I didn't work with her  Bradley  you might as well  Caldor, Bradley's  what's next  Marshall's  I never worked at Marshall's  it was Bradley's 
[02:32:00]  I was like 16  I worked at Bradley's  and I worked part time there  Bradley's  and then Caldor's  after I got sober  they're different  I'm sorry  different jobs  oh different jobs  worst vagina ever  I got in Caldor  there was a girl  she worked at like  housewares or whatever  and after inventory  I took her home  and that thing  had been fermenting  inside those pantyhose  for a good 12 hour  inventory day  high inventory  her breath smelled  like a kernel of corn  like you ever kiss  somebody who has  kernel of corn breath  in the pit of the stomach  it was atrocious 
[02:32:30]  and then  I went  down on her  and it was  revolting  it smelled like an armpit  back then  I didn't know any better  did you go with it anyway  of course I did  what am I fucking rude  she was a guest  in my home  of course you're not a communist  of course you got right in there  what are we  communists  exactly  we are not communists  you ever have a  short vagina  what do you mean  bottom out  oh fuck yeah  smaller ones  hit the back wall  like what the fuck 
[02:33:00]  is this  I'd love that problem  no  no  I would like to brag  that it was because of me  but no  she had something going on  where she had  a short back wall  ew  it was bizarre  she's a virgin  she has something  that's called youth  I was supposed to  push through that wall  yes you were  what did I know  I was a youngster  maybe it was a hymen  could have been a hormon  are you the hymen hunter  hormon  are we talking to the hymen hunter  I know 
[02:33:30]  Jimmy missed that bit too  fuck Jimmy  I know you're  out there in Hollywood  becoming a big star  but you missed some good radio  I know  I know I did  that's why I kicked the red out  last night  a radio prank gone horribly wrong  in Australia  ah it's too long to get into  yeah  you'll have to listen to  the best of it over the weekend  so we both  the countdown  worst of the week countdown  if the worst of the week countdown  doesn't include the McDonald's bit  then I'm not promoting  the worst of the week  oh shit  that's the number one bit  I think so 
[02:34:00]  tell me  tell me we're not playing  the number one bit this weekend  when you do the worst of the  well I mean  that position is number one  in my head right now  but  we would have to get word  from certain people  whether or not we could play  that's not  that decision wouldn't be made  do we know what the issue is  with the McDonald's bit  at this point  impersonation of a CEO  I don't know  something like that  it's radio  what  they impersonate  they impersonate  they impersonate  people all the time  on TV  just imagine  this is TV 
[02:34:30]  without the fucking visual  we could play parts  there was complete  compliance  as far as  I'm trying to comply here  why does radio  have to have different rules  than all other entertainment  just want to be in compliance  right here in Brainerd  right  I would think that by Friday  we should be okay  to play the whole thing  as long as it  no they're gonna cut it  to keep it safe  blah blah blah  we're entertainers  and Anthony  played a part yesterday  just like they do  in movies  and fucking TV 
[02:35:00]  maybe we'll just  play the part  with different rules  for radio  just stop it already  we'll just play the part  where you guys  congratulate him  on a job well done  stop it  don't do the countdown  this weekend  if that's  if that is being told  that it has to be left out  don't do it  I'm serious  you're the boss  just run a dumb replay  because you can't  do a countdown  and make believe  the top bit of the week  didn't happen  that's just ridiculous  and it hurts us  in the end  just play a replay  okay 
[02:35:30]  wow  right  think about it  I agree  because there's times  every once in a while  we have a bit  that is so obviously  the best bit of the week  and then you listen  over the weekend  it's every once in a while  I'll admit that  and it's not there  it's like what the fuck  yeah  then don't do the countdown  okay  yeah  it is embarrassing  I agree  totally off subject  can I tell you why  I almost knocked  Pete Popolardo's teeth out  oh yes  my agent who I love  oh god  something we're all wishing for 
[02:36:00]  it almost finally happened  we were talking about something  and he said  I forget what it was  he goes  yeah but if you're doing that  it's going to create chatter  and when he said  create chatter  I wanted to fucking  reach through the phone  and pull his teeth out  one by one with pliers  Pete if you're listening  if you ever say  create chatter again  I'll fucking cut your  brake line  chatter  create chatter  like I'm creating  some chatter  that's retarded  fucking teeth are chattering 
[02:36:30]  from the douche chills  I'll never say that again  did you create chatter  no  what was it  I don't even remember  I blocked it out  created nothing  but a fucking mental block  and uncomfortable silence  on the phone  I love Pete  I do too  I would love to know  what's going on in that head  Jonathan was talking about  Pete's awful mock turtlenecks  and whatever kind of  fucking shirt  Pete wears the worst clothes  I forget what his  fucking like his  half sweaters are  but Jonathan  my manager was really  giving him a fucking  savage beating  how was Jonathan's  cock bulge 
[02:37:00]  while you were out there  in LA  I actually have not  looked at whatever  that thing is  in his fucking jeans  you haven't looked in a while  we used to enjoy looking  it's like knowing a friend  we really did  it's like  what the fuck  is going on down there  and he would wear tight slacks  and he would be oblivious  to this massive  fucking ridiculous  whatever the fuck  it is bulge  it's like even the elephant  man's friends  got used to him  after a while  I think that's what it is  he's a goiter  Jimmy used to  Jimmy used to like  kind of get my attention  while we're having  some kind of serious  conversation about something  it's like 
[02:37:30]  we all  me and Jimmy  would just look  one time  we pointed  and started laughing  where he had to  cross his legs  and try to  hide his bulge  hide that huge bulge  he gets very uncomfortable  very uncomfortable  about that giant  fucking  JB in Utah  JB  hey what's going on  boys  how are you JB  doing pretty good  Jimmy good to have you back  thank you buddy  hey  I want to know  why  you guys like 
[02:38:00]  the morning matchup  they got a hole  on there  you guys seem to  follow over  sir  the definition  of a hole  is not Nicole  okay  Nicole's doing  a morning show  for a pop station  and there's a lot of females  that listen to that pop station  they feel comfortable  listening to Nicole  and that radio show  the hole  is actually  a woman  that has no business  being part  of a guy  talk show 
[02:38:30]  right  a locker room  type show  like ours  think our show  with some dumb broad  chime in  to try to keep  everything safe  it's very different  I'm not saying  women don't have  a place in broadcasting  they just don't have  a place when it comes  to locker room  type radio shows  it's under the console  that's their place  in broadcasting  that's right Jimmy  you tell them  fellating the men  that's right  thank you sir 
[02:39:00]  get a hold of yourself  you're fawning  this next guy  is so exciting  Chris on Long Island  has to get on  and tell his  Caldor fuck story  oh yes  Chris what do you got  there's only one of those  in the world  oh Jimmy  remember how hot  we all looked  in those brown smocks  oh they were terrible  I remember the guy  who ran that  fucking housewares department  he had the worst  plaque breath ever  it was like a wet  spoiled fruit  oh god  good  so yeah  I spent my time  between the toy department 
[02:39:30]  and housewares  also during the  cabbage patch craze  but there was a girl  in there  who  she was ultra aggressive  with me  and she was  the kind of girl  always made me cheat  on whatever girlfriend  I had  so finally one day  I sucked it up  I spent the money  got a hotel room  get her in there  after a night  of drinking and partying  she gets undressed  I go to go down on her  and it is the worst  smell ever  she was wearing leggings  and cowboy boots  and it was just  horrible  I'm like alright  I'm just gonna plow through this 
[02:40:00]  let me just  you know  start fucking her  I put her  feet up over my shoulders  and her feet  smelled so bad  I was like  I'm like  I gotta get out of here  I had to bust the nuts  so quick  and I'm like  oh yeah  we really gotta go  it was horrific  the worst experience  ever fucking  for me  that reminded me  oh no  what  now I have a story  I love John Valvey  so much  and he has a song  it's a parody  of the Edmund Fitzgerald  it's not that long

[03:07:00]  I think you phrased it well  and I thought her response  was a legitimate response  to that question  maybe I don't hate the guy as much  in order  no  because he  all he wanted to do  was say  that this girl  had the right to say  what she said  she had a  a good answer  for the question  but in order to  ask that question  and not offend this  fucking  yes exactly  who would have walked off  he had to say

[03:25:30]  that you had a hand in her success  no  I saw it on your website  I never said  I claim anything  I say I'm just  a big fan of hers  and I'm a music lover  and I think music lovers  look at her right there  Perez  she was here Perez  good day in New York  we are claiming  we had a hand  in October of 2008  this is where it all started  that was a couple of days  after she performed  at my CMJ showcase  that I had here  in New York last year  oh look at you little show up  no I'm so proud of her  I really feel like  she's like my daughter  and sister and wife  and it's great 
[03:26:00]  you know those were the days  when she would wear  that outfit  all the time  now at the VMA's  she wore like seven outfits  over the course  of an hour and a half  crazy  times have changed  over the last year  I'm so proud of Gaga  I wonder what year  his father just blew  his brains out  wait how do you spell that  oh wait let me be  L-E-W either way  oh no come on  that's funny though

[03:27:30]  to do that  I don't even understand it  grade you  make you feel like shit  no this is why  oh okay  well that doesn't  I don't see how  that's constructive  or  would you trade Jess for her  for Lady Gaga  yeah  long term  or short term  um  I mean then  good question  permanently  you gotta make  a permanent decision  Lady Gaga  wow  so now  that tells me  you don't care  about Jess enough  that I can touch her boobies  no no no  I told you already  yesterday that you could not  I told you
