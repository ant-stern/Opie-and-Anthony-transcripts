<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts – Opie, Anthony, and James Norton – engaging in their usual vulgar and insulting banter, targeting the show's crew.  The conversation quickly turned to the news story of Dr. Nicholas Bartha, who blew up his Manhattan brownstone during a contentious divorce, injuring several people. Opie boasted about having predicted a suicide attempt by Bartha prior to the incident.  The hosts dissected the doctor's motivations, highlighting his rage stemming from the divorce, the loss of his home and practice, and his ex-wife's status as a Holocaust survivor.  They played audio clips from news reports and read excerpts from Bartha's email detailing his plans and resentment towards his ex-wife. The discussion expanded to broader themes of divorce, the perceived bias in divorce proceedings against men, and Anthony's own negative experiences with divorce.  Numerous crude jokes were made throughout the segment, punctuated by listener calls, one of which congratulated Opie on his prediction, and humorous impressions of sportscasters, particularly John Sterling, commenting on the event.  The Bartha story was compared to other recent news events, including a Boston tunnel collapse and a World Cup incident involving Zinedine Zidane.

The show continued with a chaotic mix of listener calls. Mike from Long Island criticized other cities for less exciting news compared to New York. Chester from Missouri shared two unbelievable survival stories. Mike from New Jersey complained about Opie's tendency to over-explain, prompting a discussion about broadcasting challenges. Kevin from Hartford described a car accident caused by an 89-year-old driver, leading to a discussion about elderly drivers. BJ from Oakdale sparked a playful, antagonistic exchange about which city, Philadelphia or New York, was "badass," leading to reminiscing about past incidents. Steve, a former local news employee, lamented the tendency of smaller news stations to force local angles into national stories.  Various Philadelphia callers further boasted about their city's "badass" nature.  A significant portion focused on the return of prostitution to Hell's Kitchen, with a humorous soundbite from a resident and speculation about government motivations.  The hosts also discussed the doctor's suicide, a WB11 news traffic reporter's image in a parked helicopter, an upcoming karaoke event, Bill Burr's upcoming appearances, and a proposed ban on using credit cards for online gambling.  The overall tone remained irreverent, sexually charged, and cynical. Bill Burr was mentioned as a future guest.

The next segment started with the hosts reacting to a Robosaurus destroying what they believed to be a producer's car.  This led to a mocking discussion of a local news program's reporting style, described as using "shuffles" to transition between segments.  Bill Burr was a guest in studio. The conversation shifted to Opie and Anthony's upcoming tour, ticket sales, and the comedian lineup.  Anthony discussed the chaos of having family staying at his house for three weeks.  Listener calls included one from Steve from Utah who initially complimented then criticized the show, leading to a heated exchange. George, another caller, expressed support. The segment ended with the hosts recounting issues with a building maintenance worker and their technical difficulties, followed by the "Daily Dump Report" detailing censored segments.

A subsequent segment began with a discussion of traffic fatality statistics, focusing on the unexpectedly low number of deaths among senior citizens compared to teenagers.  This transitioned into a vulgar comedic bit around the invented word "Bippy," used in increasingly obscene contexts relating to elderly people's anatomy and sexuality.  The conversation shifted to Bill Burr's kitchen renovation and included several caller anecdotes about older drivers. A state trooper caller mentioned listening to replays and recounted a DUI arrest.  The discussion returned to older drivers and their driving abilities, leading to more sexually explicit jokes about Bill Burr's grandmother.  Garrison from Virginia Beach criticized the show for offensive jokes about senior citizens and terrorism, which the hosts largely ignored, continuing their humor. They also discussed a Miami radio show’s reference to “Tippy Tom” and Bill Burr's negative experience with two Houston radio hosts.  The segment concluded with discussion of Mancow Muller's potential departure from his Chicago radio station, interspersed with more sexually explicit jokes and listener calls.

The final segment focused heavily on the purported irregularities surrounding Suri Cruise's birth certificate, citing a TMZ report about discrepancies in the filing date and the lack of Tom Cruise's signature.  The hosts speculated on the reasons, referencing Scientology. The latter half featured a listener contest for the "most obnoxious 30 seconds ever," playing numerous audio clips and soliciting listener submissions.  Bill Burr participated, making jokes about his grandmother and nonexistent movie career.  Several callers phoned in, including one who credited the show for their XM radio subscription. A ukulele rendition of "While My Guitar Gently Weeps" was played and heavily criticized.  The segment ended with a commercial for a fictional "Jim Norton Sensitivity Handbook."


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show on XM202 featuring O.P., Anthony, and James Norton.  Can you hear me?  No!  Right off!  We're so excited to be back.  Rabid radio retards.  Wow!  We're dummies!  We're the only radio show that makes you want to beat us.  We've been known to get our faces in the news.  We're perverts.  Stupid.  We stink.  We just love doing radio.  This is a weird show.  No one puts asses in the seat like Greg and Tony. 
[00:00:30]  O.P., I love the hitting and the fighting.  Anthony.  I'm a terrorist looking for other terrorists.  Jesus.  I'm a speechless, worthless nothing.  We all know that.  I love women.  I'm a slump, fat pig.  And a crew of misfits.  Hurricane Ben!  Ben looks like a tall baby.  He's like Chuck.  Martini Steve!  Steve is a piece of garbage.  Perfectly enunciating fool that we paint him out to be.  Right.  E-Rock!  Hopefully he's going through a car wash with his mouth open.  I bring nothing to the table.  I don't care.  Shut up.  No.  What's wrong, Eric? 
[00:01:00]  My closet's burning so bad.  Sit down and put on your laughing hats.  Just relax.  Here comes the funny.  Welcome to the Opie and A.  Shut up!  Let's get the show on the road.  That's right.  Yeah, we got to get right into it.  That's a nice little tidbit that you started telling us right before the show started, Anthony.  Good morning and welcome to the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:01:30]  We're going to get right into it today.  Hi.  The O and A virus spreading across America.  Our phone number 1-866-313-FREE.  Your pals, Opie and Anthony, broadcasting from the greatest city in the world.  Yeah, most people think it's for one reason, you know, the greatest city in the world.  Everyone just says that.  We look at it another way.  It's just the greatest city in the world because so much crap happens here on a daily basis that Opie was saying it in the office. 
[00:02:00]  One week, we have crazy homeless chainsaw guy hacking people apart in the subway.  That was last week.  That was last week.  Old news.  You don't even remember that guy anymore.  Why would you remember when you got crazy divorce blow up the building guy?  This week.  This city is unbelievable.  We have a collection of nuts and kooks in an environment that is very video game-like.  So you could just go around destroying things or hack it.  What else do you do in a video game besides hack people apart with various weapons like chainsaws and things like that? 
[00:02:30]  You blow up buildings and it's just a pisser to live here.  And it gives you a feeling of being alive.  Right.  Deep down, we all love this stuff.  It comes on the news.  Not many people will admit it, but deep down, we all love destruction.  When it comes on the news, we've got to set three different TVs to three different news channels.  You're scrambling around changing channels.  You want all the details.  It's just because we enjoy this as human beings. 
[00:03:00]  By the way, what did I tell you in the office that I needed today?  I can't supply that.  I'm a heterosexual man.  Whip.  You ass.  What did you need today?  I needed everyone to tell me.  Oh, that you were right.  Well, look, they're already calling.  Yep.  Chris in Houston.  Chris, what's going on?  What's going on, boys?  I just want to congratulate you on your prediction yesterday. 
[00:03:30]  Thank you, sir.  During the XM show, this building explosion happened here in Manhattan.  I'm sure it's national news, so I don't think we have to explain it too much.  I said construction.  Ann said construction.  I said suicide attempt, and this dude wanted to take other people with him.  Bingo!  You said suicide attempt, like, three minutes after the explosion was announced.  I was way off.  I said hot air balloon crashed into it.  A Zeppelin crash. 
[00:04:00]  It's a Zeppelin crash.  Well, I knew because I had a doctor's appointment, and he kind of tipped me off and said, you know.  Don't show between.  Today might not be a good day to show up to get your you-know-what scraped out, all right?  Well, this guy, it just turns out, um...  Can I start with the headlines?  Please.  We are so excited, obviously.  Please.  And I know you are, too, out there.  Oh.  People love this stuff.  Don't say you don't.  I have a special admiration for this guy now. 
[00:04:30]  Yes, absolutely.  It might sound a little odd.  Don't go against me yet.  Don't jump the gun.  Jump the gun.  Thank you, Jim, with those more 1945 cliches.  Clichés.  And I think it's about time that, uh, you know, someone starts admitting that we, as  humans, actually love this stuff.  That's why the news covers it like they do.  We love checking out war.  We love war.  War, destruction.  We love car crashes on the highway.  Carnage. 
[00:05:00]  There's not a person out there that when they're stuck in traffic forever because of a car crash,  that when they get to the accident scene, they're hoping that everyone's okay and there's  not much happening.  You're hoping for the sickest crash ever.  I don't look, by the way.  You're not a looker?  You know why?  Out of principle.  I hate rubberneckers.  And if I'm looking at the accident, I can't look at the guy in front of me whose brake lights  go on.  And the second the brake lights go on, I hit the horn like a madman. 
[00:05:30]  Good for you.  Like a madman, I hit the horn.  And then when I get the, the, hey, the arms flying up in the air that I see in his back  window or out the, out the window, I roll my window down and start yelling curse words  and say, stop looking and drive.  And then I use some bad language and sometimes racial epithets.  And then I'm on my way.  I was in the Belt Parkway one time coming home from Long Island through Brooklyn.  And there was a woman who slowed down a rubberneck in accident so badly. 
[00:06:00]  I almost got rear-ended because she literally stopped from doing 55 to maybe 20 miles an hour.  Do you just want to choke these people?  I almost broke my thumb.  I've never beeped.  It was one of those little horns on the side, like chiclet horns on my old Saturn.  I beeped so hard, the car actually went, the horn wore out.  All right.  I've done that.  I've done that.  What are you beeping at?  Yeah.  Very annoying, the rubberneck.  All right.  Let's start with the headlines, okay? 
[00:06:30]  In order, New York papers of most boring to the best.  New York Post, sorry.  Blast you.  Divorce doc blows up city mansion.  Blast you.  Blast, blast you.  Using old pirate talk.  What the hell is that?  Newsday, New York Newsday.  Cops suspect explosion was blast of rage.  Angry at wife over $4 million divorce.  Doctor apparently blew a building and possible suicide. 
[00:07:00]  Try.  I love that quote.  And the Daily News, Dr. Doom.  Dr. Doom.  What does it say?  Quote, muah-ha-ha-ha-ha.  Muah-ha-ha-ha-ha.  And it goes on.  Crazed doctor blows up east side home and failed suicide bid.  Crazed.  Firefighters rescue him from beneath burning rubble.  The dude lived, by the way.  Sensible, ballsy doctor.  That's how I would, that's what I would call him. 
[00:07:30]  And note reveals his refusal to part with house in bitter divorce.  There you go.  All on the front page of the New York Daily News.  Good.  Divorce is a little bitter.  So what do we know?  What do we know?  We know that this couple was married for quite some time.  They're in their 60s, the guy at least, the doctor in the 60s.  She's the ex-wife, a Holocaust survivor.  I guess she was a kid at the time.  But a Holocaust survivor nonetheless. 
[00:08:00]  They're going through a bitter divorce.  Allegations that the husband was hanging swastikas around the place kind of offend her.  I guess that worked.  But the bottom line is these lawyers get involved in divorces.  And once they get involved, all bets are off.  It becomes an ugly, ugly scene.  And this guy was about to lose this brownstone.  $10 million brownstone.  He's going to lose the brownstone of this woman. 
[00:08:30]  And then you're telling me something about his practice.  And a doctor has a license to practice medicine.  That license is a marital asset.  It is a marital asset, just like money in the bank or anything else.  That practice that he does is marital asset.  So that has to be divvied up.  Divvied up.  So not only is he going to lose all of the $10 million brownstone because for some reason the woman gets the residence regardless. 
[00:09:00]  Well, because women can't take care of themselves.  That's what these lawyers and judges are telling the women out there.  That you can't take care of yourselves in the year 2006.  Unless they're out there telling everybody they can take care of themselves and should be given special rights to break through the glass ceilings in the corporate world.  That's fine.  But in divorce, it's archaic.  It hasn't changed since I guess the original laws for divorce are there because during the little house on the prairie days when you would take a wife. 
[00:09:30]  She would be a wife and take care of your soddy, your little house, whatever Laura Ingalls lived in.  And if the husband either died or left her, she's screwed until she finds another guy.  What's she going to do?  So the husband would have to, if he divorced, would have to take care of the wife.  She couldn't do anything else. 
[00:10:00]  Well, in 2006, women are still saying we can't do anything else without you men.  Well, they're playing it both ways.  We're screwed without you men.  They're playing it both ways.  As far as the divorce goes.  Right.  Everything else is we're fine.  We're independent.  We don't need you.  Let us do this, this, that.  Women are getting away with murder in these divorce cases.  Oh, because they become accustomed to a certain lifestyle.  That's right.  That's what the argument is.  Unless the man says, well, I'm accustomed to getting laid four times a week.  Right.  So how about this? 
[00:10:30]  You come over and continue to take care of that for me, hooker with a ring, and then you can have the place.  Bingo.  Bird and Philly.  Oh, okay.  We get why Ant's on his side.  Need I explain it further for West Palm?  Oh, poor West Palm.  They don't know anything, do you?  Your PD says.  Anthony went through hell and back.  Yeah.  In his divorce case.  Yeah.  It was lovely.  Where his ex-wife was claiming that she had something to do with the success of the Opie and Anthony radio show.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That was in there.  Nice. 
[00:11:00]  Good, clean fun.  The divorce lawyers out there should die.  This guy said.  For what they do to the men.  He said to his wife, you're going to go from a gold digger to an ash and rubble digger.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Brilliant.  Oh, this guy's a class act.  Brilliant.  And you know what?  I applaud him today.  Yes.  Let me play devil's advocate.  I almost, in a way, understand why she didn't want to be around this loser.  How do you blow up a building that you're in and live?  Yeah.  That is pretty bad.  What a zilch.  That building completely came apart, and he's laying in the rubble yelling, help, help, 
[00:11:30]  to the fire department.  Come on fire, mister.  You know why?  There's a brick on my face.  You know why?  He was in the blast zone, and he decided, wow, this is too crazy.  Maybe if I move back a little bit, I'll still.  Do you think?  Or was he like right near the gas?  He probably got a little scared at the end and said, you know, I'll probably still die,  but it'll just feel better or safer if I die from the third floor or something.  Yeah, we need a little more info to come in during the coming days of where he was,  how this happened, how he lived. 
[00:12:00]  Yeah.  Let me go to John in Chicago.  John, what's up?  Hey there, Jen.  Yeah.  Hey, man.  How y'all doing?  First of all, I want to say you're my favorite.  I even named my son Christopher Gregory.  Ew.  My mom hated Gregory.  That's why my name's Greg.  That's adorable.  My dad's name is Gregory, too, so y'all got a double thing going.  But anyways, I want to call you out.  I think you need to watch your tail.  The cop's probably going to be after you, Opie. 
[00:12:30]  Yesterday, you called it a suicide attempt.  I think you might be involved, buddy.  I did call it, like, right after we saw it on the news.  He's got an alibi.  He actually mentioned it before the building blew up.  I mentioned it on the walkover.  I mentioned it to Anthony and Jimmy.  I'm like, you might want to...  Keep your eyes over there.  You might want to listen closely.  Dude, watch this.  All right, y'all.  Have a good one.  Bye, mister.  And by the way, Coke Logic writes, if Opie was right about the building, then, yes, the  Chinese may really be coming. 
[00:13:00]  Yeah.  Now you've got to pay attention to everything he says.  He could be right.  Should we get right into some audio here?  Please.  So the doctor was going through a bitter divorce.  Bitter divorce.  And it got to a point he just had it.  And she apparently has a...  What's her lawyer?  He's one of the biggies.  Oh, really?  Starts with an F.  Raul Felder.  Raul Felder.  Oh, that dude.  Oh, this guy is like the divorce king.  You never want him knocking on your door. 
[00:13:30]  There's two lawyers you don't want coming after you.  Him and the one that came after me.  Stupid, fat Dominic Barbera.  Who has to pay the disgusting lawyer's fees?  Oh, the husband.  The husband has to write a check.  When it comes to money in a divorce and custody battles, you're right.  Women are still back in 1910.  Thank God we didn't have children.  It's so unbalanced.  But we all just accept it.  These divorce lawyers are getting away with murder.  The judges know it's not fair anymore.  I thank the dear Lord that I never had children with that woman. 
[00:14:00]  That I would have to still have some type of civil contact for the kids.  For the children.  Oh, cut all ties.  Lotto runs out.  If you're listening, dear.  If you're listening, honey.  Lotto runs out in a couple of years.  Only a couple of years to go?  Hope you're saving.  Hope you're tucking it away. 
[00:14:30]  The lotto runs out.  Only a couple more years to go?  Give or take.  Nah, it's a little more.  It's a couple.  It's 2006.  Well, it would be 18 if you had kids.  All right, several, few.  More than a couple, less than several.  Are you done by 2010?  Yep.  All right, that's not bad.  Done, Ski!  You're going to get a huge raise one day.  You're going to be like, oh my God.  Look at this huge raise I just got.  You're doing nothing.  Here's what you want to do.  You want to show her.  On the next contract, when you guys are going to negotiate, you push the money onto me. 
[00:15:00]  I'll hold it for you.  And this way, it shows up not in your paperwork at all.  And then when it time goes up, I'll give it to you.  I'll give it to Jimmy.  No, no, but I'll give it back to you.  To hold onto you, you give it back to me.  Of course.  We actually tried to do that back in the day.  That trick never works.  I mean, I know you're kidding, but we actually tried it.  Well, you hash these things out.  You try to talk about it.  It never went past the talking phase, Opie.  It's one of those things that like, because divorce lawyers, again, will keep tabs on every 
[00:15:30]  cent you have.  Yeah.  Where it went, what it went to.  You know, it's like none of your goddamn business.  And how's your marriage going?  Apparently, the one he was in when he was sitting over my divorce, well, it didn't work out too  well.  Can I ask you something?  Oh, she took you for a few bucks, cubby.  You have to cut a check, what?  Once every whatever?  Yeah, quarterly.  All right, quarter.  Are you allowed to just have a truck back up to where she's living and pay her in pennies? 
[00:16:00]  I don't think there was any contingency put on what denominations I deliver the money  in, yeah?  If I wanted to be a real bastard, I could.  You know something?  It's not worth your wealth.  I would have no problem.  No, because you end up like a building guy.  Renting a truck every quarter.  You ever see War of the Roses?  That's completely filled with pennies and guys with shovels.  I understand.  Sounds great. 
[00:16:30]  You ever see War of the Roses?  Yep.  It just escalates.  One side does one thing.  The other side does the other.  And I saw it happening.  And I think a lot of people that have been through divorces see it happening like that.  So you just at some point have to take a breath, sit in the lotus position perhaps.  Get your rowboat.  And a cinder block.  Take the old bag and little Connor out to Modesto for a little cruise.  No kidding. 
[00:17:00]  Hey, by the way, really fast.  Bill from Waterford.  He helps the show out every morning.  The irony of this case is that this guy was a suicide bomber, but the news won't call him a suicide bomber so they don't scare the public.  Well.  But they'll cover this news story as if it was 9-11.  If they called him a suicide bomber, we would rip into the news like crazy.  Forget about it.  Yeah.  This guy was a guy who wanted to kill himself and take the building down so the wife wouldn't have his practice or the building. 
[00:17:30]  Which, you know, I don't know.  Wouldn't she get the insurance money or something?  I don't know how that works.  Perhaps.  And I hope we find out that he canceled the insurance on the building and himself before he did this.  Because that's brilliant.  He seems like a pretty smart guy.  He really does.  Pretty sharp fella.  He had it and just wanted to end his life, end his misery, and make her suffer in the end.  How long will they marry him?  The third time he tried to kill himself?  Oh, my God.  This is the third time?  This guy stinks at it.  I don't think he's a zilter.  I think this is what happens when you're in these bitter freaking divorce cases. 
[00:18:00]  I mean, how do you not get it right?  He's trying all these awful methods.  One time he threw marshmallows in the air and he hoped they would fall on him to death.  What a jerk off.  Just get it done already, stupid.  Now he got no house.  Held his breath.  He held his breath.  And he fell into a pile of hot dogs hoping they would drown him.  The way to do it is do the whole gas thing.  But before you like the cigarette or whatever, you inject yourself nicely with some of the stuff you got laying around the office.  You're dead.  Then, you know, as you're fading out, you like the cigarette. 
[00:18:30]  Goodbye.  Bye.  Yesterday's horror came after two previous suicide attempts by Bartha, an emergency room doctor who worked at Lenox Hills Hospital.  Last year, he was discovered barricaded in his basement nearly unconscious after being overcome by gas.  That's what I feel sometimes in this very studio when Jimmy gets a little nervous and gets upset stomach.  No, it's sour stomach.  Oh, sour.  My stomach is sour.  And several years earlier, he locked himself in his office and tried to do himself in by setting off an insecticide bomb. 
[00:19:00]  All right.  This guy does stink as far as killing himself goes.  This guy is an attention-seeking fool who married a drunkard.  I've had enough of him.  He's trying to kill fleas and himself at the same time.  Bug bomb.  Really?  A letter and two words.  R. Bud Dwyer.  By the way, a lot of people.  That's a man who knows how to take the gun by the handle and shove it in your mouth.  A lot of people are pointing out that probably no insurance money. 
[00:19:30]  Oh, because of suicide.  Well, and you're blowing up your place.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Think about it.  The insurance company is going to at least dispute that for years.  Of course they will.  We're not paying.  The guy blew the place up.  Wow, you're right.  Very good.  So maybe this doctor is pretty smart after all.  What awful ways and methods, though.  He set off a decon bomb in the house.  Schmuck.  There's a bunch of dead bugs laying around him.  Damn it.  Still here.  Maybe he should call Greg Opie Hughes and drop a few of those at his place. 
[00:20:00]  He hopes you to find him dead with his doctor nose in the electric trap in the kitchen.  All right, listen.  Now we've got to take a quick break.  When we get back, we'll get more into this story.  We've got the audio.  It's great.  Yeah, because the news, again, this is a combination of a great divorce story, action story here in New York, and the stupid news and the stupid people they interview.  Yeah, so we'll do that.  We're just queuing up a little bit.  Eric ran.  I've never seen that before. 
[00:20:30]  It was kind of a...  What happened?  Wes Palm, I've got to tell you, Eric works really hard for the radio program.  He certainly does.  But that was awful.  He just needs to get more sleep at night, and then he'll be okay.  Anthony Wedding Planners, we go to break.  I love this thing.  Oh, yeah, this is words of wisdom, Lloyd.  Check this out, and we'll continue with the Opie and Anthony show.  You're getting married.  No, no.  Here's Anthony from the Opie and Anthony show to help you plan the perfect wedding.  I'm talking to you. 
[00:21:00]  Are you listening?  First, you must carefully choose a wedding ring for your gal.  I went into one of those jewelry stores in Penn Station, and I think I spent 300 bucks on it.  Right.  Well, you should also make sure your betrothed gets along with your dear, sweet mother.  Your son is a scumbag.  Maybe not.  Your wedding night, on the other hand, should be a magical one.  I believe I laid there looking at the ceiling with tears of regret and sorrow rolling down the sides of my face. 
[00:21:30]  Just follow the simple steps, and you'll have the perfect wedding.  Just like...  And...  Eh, I got nothing.  I was shocked.  I was horrified.  I was broke.  Hopeless.  What did I get myself into?  It only took nine and a half years for me to leave.  Never marry a lot!  I was a broken, beaten man.  And I had been married for six hours. 
[00:22:00]  Wolf mother!  Down!  Love these guys.  It's the Opie and Anthony show, the ONA virus spreading across America.  Phone number 1-866-313-FREE.  That's 1-866-313-FREE.  I had a funny instant feedback from Stephen S. from Bayshore.  I heard John Sterling was walking by the exploding brownstone.  It was heard to yell out, 
[00:22:30]  Brownie goes boom!  I hate giving credits for that one.  Steve is very funny.  He's always on.  Come on.  That's why this is the greatest radio show in America, by the way.  That's right!  Because everybody else out there is taking this story and taking the serious angle.  We say,  Ha!  Bravissimo!  To the rest of the radio hosts out there.  The real deal is we applaud this doctor. 
[00:23:00]  Unfortunately, some innocent people got hurt.  And I understand that.  I take that part of it very seriously.  Collateral damage.  But as a guy, we kind of understand what happens.  Anthony understands what was going on here.  I understand what pushes this guy into this situation.  And you'll hear, during some of these stupid interviews that the news does,  people saying,  This, I don't believe it.  This guy's a rational man.  And blah, blah, blah.  They call him a nice guy.  It doesn't matter. 
[00:23:30]  Take the nicest guy in the world and put him through that situation,  and he can turn into a potential murderer or this suicide guy blowing up property.  You always hear about things like that.  You were getting there.  What?  You were losing your mind.  How many years did your divorce take?  Years.  Three.  Three years.  Yeah!  Three.  Three years.  Three years.  They had no kids and no property.  I didn't own anything. 
[00:24:00]  Didn't own a house.  Huh?  And I'm gay.  Yeah, no kids.  Didn't own anything.  And it would have went on another year.  Anthony just decided to throw in the towel.  You just said,  You know what?  I'm done.  Mathematically, it wasn't working out.  Congratulations.  You win.  You wore me down.  It was settled.  We settled.  A lot of divorces just end up settling.  They don't go to trial.  Everyone's got this,  and I've mentioned this before,  everyone's got this perception of court  that you're going to walk in  and it's going to be like an episode  of some court show on television 
[00:24:30]  where you come up with this stunning bit of evidence  or at the last minute someone barges in  with testimonies.  It's not.  It's the only way the justice system can move  is if it's cookie cutter.  Everything's based on precedent  and what happened before.  So there's nothing new that's happening.  Your guy A, she's girl B.  All right.  Chick C works her way in  and wrecks the whole thing.  No.  And it's over. 
[00:25:00]  But Chick C is not a C.  No, no.  He's just using it as...  It could be X, Y, Z.  There you go.  X, Y, Z.  And it just gets to the point  where they look at money.  It's like slide rule justice.  You just look at a figure  and that's what's going to be divvied up  regardless of what you did,  what she did,  what this happened.  It doesn't matter.  There's no courtroom scene  like in television  where you go, 
[00:25:30]  let me tell you about  how I made my career.  I started this dream of mine  at 11 years.  Are you done?  Shut up.  Pay her.  That's what happens in real life.  And a guy like this  couldn't take it.  Couldn't take it.  So he turned on the gas  and blew up his marital assets.  Hats off, my friend.  Bravo.  She did nothing probably  but just drink  and act like just a dumb married floozy  while he's out earning the bread 
[00:26:00]  and making all the money  and making all the critical decisions.  She probably did nothing,  forgive my language,  but behaved like a highfalutin gal.  Whoa, easy.  Who knows, though?  We really don't know for sure.  I don't know,  but the facts will come out  on this one.  The facts are going to come out.  I think this story gets much better  by the end of the week.  Hey, let's say hi to Kelly in Idaho.  Hey, guys.  How's it going?  There's some gold digger jokes  to be made for a Holocaust survivor, too,  let me tell you.  Not going to hear them here, though.  Not going to hear them here.  Give Anthony a day. 
[00:26:30]  I know, Ashley's trying to  rifle through the rubble  and find the art  that the doctor was hanging on the wall.  There were some valuables in there.  Kelly.  Kelly, girl name from Idaho.  What's up?  I've been listening to you guys  since I got my XM,  and I just want to tell you guys  you're doing fucking awesome  and keep it up.  Wow.  There you go.  I appreciate it.  Nice.  Thank you, Kelly.  Kelly, we appreciate that,  but you had to say F and off.  Awesome.  Yeah, that's all.  Kelly, what do you like  about the Opie and Anthony show, 
[00:27:00]  by the way?  Oh, there's a tricky question.  That needs no answer.  That must have been  a pesky line problem.  All right, let's go to the audio.  Doctor committing suicide.  And he didn't get the job done.  No, he didn't.  And now he's even in more hell.  Third time.  60% of his body's burned.  His 40% chance of living  at this point.  Old Dorito skin.  What's he going to do?  I hope he dies,  but because it's what he wants.  Yeah.  That's very generous of you, Jimmy. 
[00:27:30]  I hope he dies.  I don't mean that in some,  like, he should die.  I mean, I hope he dies  just to spite this pig  he was married to.  There you go.  All right, here we go.  Lucy, to set the scene,  even before you get here,  you smell it before you see it.  The smell of burned debris  is strong in the air.  We know all night long  demolition crews  have been taking away  some of that building material  from this site  after that huge gas explosion.  There was a giant fire  that erupted  shortly after the explosion. 
[00:28:00]  It leveled  the $10 million townhouse.  The residents around here  on 62nd Street  between Madison and Park Avenues  have yet to be allowed  back into their homes.  Right now,  an investigation  is underway to determine  if the 66-year-old doctor  who lived and worked here  caused the explosion  in a suicide attempt.  Nicholas Bartha,  who was rescued by firefighters,  had been in the middle  of a horrible divorce  and he apparently  sent an email  to his ex-wife  saying he would  never sell the home 
[00:28:30]  they once lived in.  Never sell.  I'll never sell.  Well, they got  the foreign eyewitness here.  Yeah.  In the explosion  and subsequent rescue effort,  at least 15 people,  civilians and firefighters  were hurt.  For others,  it was close enough.  The whole building  fell down.  At a few seconds,  I go crazy.  I am very lucky  I'm alive. 
[00:29:00]  As for Dr. Bartha,  he remains  in critical condition.  He apparently called out  to firefighters  when he was trapped  under debris,  but now investigators  are waiting  to talk with him.  I bet.  I want to have  a word or two  with him.  And I want to say it again,  I mean, you know,  obviously some innocent  people got hurt.  Yeah, you never like that.  That's that part of the story.  No one else got hurt but him.  No, a bunch of people  did get hurt.  Firefighters got hurt.  Obviously, that's not cool.  No, the guy is a selfish guy. 
[00:29:30]  I mean, that's obvious,  but that's what  that type of atmosphere,  that divorce atmosphere,  will do to you.  What tipped you off  to be selfish?  It drives you crazy.  In fact, he was married  to a Holocaust survivor  and put swastikas  in the kitchen?  Yeah, that's a little off.  The guy was taunting her  with swastikas in the apartment.  So she'd come home  and, oh, I see  you've decorated the place.  All she wants to do  is make a cup of tea.  Like what I've done  with the place, honey?  She puts barbed wire  on the kitchen table. 
[00:30:00]  Look familiar?  She just wants to relax  and have breakfast.  It would be funny  if she was just a nice lady  and he's just a creep.  Yeah, that could be.  Somebody print up  the instant feedback.  Some more John Sterling lines  are coming in.  Oh, no.  They're fantastic.  And Jimmy does a great  John Sterling impression,  so we want to exploit that today.  More audio  from this fine story.  Here in Elmhurst, Queens  is the satellite office  for a doctor  who shared office space  with Dr. Bartha.  And this doctor...  Wow, close call.  ...he has an email  that clearly says  that Bartha  set this fire intentionally 
[00:30:30]  and explains why.  But not everyone  agrees with that.  What they do agree on  is they're shocked.  Horror.  Horror.  Horror.  I can't believe it.  Is it horror?  That's the reaction  from this scene  from a friend  and fellow physician  who shares office space  with Dr. Nicholas Bartha.  Paul Montia, M.D.,  received a copy  of the 14-page email  that Dr. Bartha  sent to Bartha's wife's attorney  and to people close to him.  It left this internist 
[00:31:00]  with this conclusion.  This is related  to the divorce.  So you're completely convinced  this is a suicide attempt?  No question.  Did I say the firefighters?  Obviously, I meant firefighters.  I'm still clogged up.  I got my stupid summer cold  that me and three other people  in America have.  Give me a little bit  of a break today.  You won't be alone.  He has summer AIDS.  So, do we have any excerpts  from this email? 
[00:31:30]  Yeah, the one that Jimmy said,  which is fantastic.  That she'll...  I don't think I got that one here.  It was in the post.  Buh, buh, buh, buh, buh.  When you...  Here's what he wrote.  When you read this lines,  your life will change forever.  You deserve it.  You will be transformed  from a gold digger  to ash and rubbish digger.  You always wanted me  to sell the house.  I always told you  I will leave the house 
[00:32:00]  only if I'm dead.  You ridiculed me.  You should have taken it seriously.  In the rambling emissive,  Bartha 66 also chastised  his ex-wife for forcing his hand  by fighting for a multi-million dollar  divorce settlement.  Cordula?  Was that her name?  Yeah.  Well, at least she had  a pretty name.  Cordula.  Sounds like part of your brain. 
[00:32:30]  Cordula.  The cordula lobe  came off behind  the Stemmons freeway sign  and wound up on the car.  On an all-new house,  he must fix  this woman's cordula.  What will house do?  House blows up his house.  On an all-new house.  His wife's oblongata cordula.  She came in with a hangnail  and left  with a swollen cordula. 
[00:33:00]  That house must cure.  Hate that show.  Up for an Emmy.  Cordula,  with this,  you disinherited your children.  Now Joanna  and Serena  have good reason  to sign the  strap hanger  and rent stabilization  petitions  suggesting that  by demolishing the house,  he would be  dooming his two estranged  children  to financial ruin.  That's a good  66-year-old  selfless father.  Yeah.  Wow,  he's pissed  at everybody though. 
[00:33:30]  To his 27-year-old  clothing designer  daughter,  Joanna,  he wrote,  you can now forget  having a fashion store.  And he said,  Serena,  28,  the family's aspiring  pastry chef and cook  could abandon her dreams  of opening her own restaurant.  Wow.  This guy is bitter.  Bertha's often irrational  ranting  ended with another  final message,  a very final message  to his ex.  Cordula.  Cordula.  Oh, yeah,  Cordula. 
[00:34:00]  Yeah.  Oh,  you are gonna get  some tonight,  Cordula.  You like that,  don't you?  Yeah, yeah,  you're a hard bitch,  Cordula.  Cordula.  You're a dirty,  filthy Cordula,  aren't you?  Cordula?  This guy's a scumbag.  Cordula.  My further staying alive  does not make any sense.  Life passed me by  and I could not achieve  anything I planned.  Or everything I planned. 
[00:34:30]  Oh, yeah.  He mentioned the site  of his beloved townhouse,  noting,  I hope there will be  a memorial built  on the place  in the memory  of Eastern Europeans  who were betrayed  at Yalta  by President Franklin  Delano Roosevelt.  Oh, wow.  Wow.  This gets better.  You think they're actually  gonna put a plaque  to Eastern Europeans  over there?  Yeah,  the Nazis,  the Stasi,  let's just put them  by the KGB.  Nah,  it's gonna be a high rise  and no one's gonna remember  in five years.  He denounces everything 
[00:35:00]  and everyone  from fascists  and communists  to Jane Fonda  and political correctness  and makes it clear  that the forced sale  of his house  was the spark  that turned him suicidal  for the third time  in recent years.  He recalled his childhood  in Romania  when his family  was forced to hide  in a cave  to escape the Nazis  and later after the war  when their home  was seized by communists.  He said his mother  was obsessed  to get back our house  but she never did.  And I heard someone 
[00:35:30]  Parker,  someone from Special  from Wackbag,  Parker Ford PA,  I heard Sterling say  a floor to ceiling  and a basement  to rooftop.  That's for the New York  audience by the way.  This guy apparently  I can explain that one  West Palm.  No West Palm,  sorry.  Sorry,  you don't get the  explanation on that one.  Apparently he was  going back.  He wanted to file  a divorce in 1980  but changed his mind  because of the children. 
[00:36:00]  See?  The children.  This guy could have  been out of it  in 1980.  But the children.  Someone from their  mobile device.  I love this guy.  What a bitter F.  Yeah,  this guy's just miserable.  Now he's even more  miserable because  he's all burnt up.  But in November 1999  he said child rearing  issues caused a major  rift between husband  and wife.  See?  What was I saying  yesterday?  What was I saying?  Bartha claimed  Cordula refused  to control  their now grown  daughters. 
[00:36:30]  Two years later  Cordula Bartha  moved out  and filed for divorce.  After a trial  she was granted  divorce on grounds  of cruel  and inhumane  treatment  which by the way  is another great  thing in New York.  You need a reason  and they only give you  like three.  Cruel and inhuman  adultery  and no sex  for a year.  Well they said  there was a problem  which they didn't agree  with the way  the children  were being reared.  She said to him  please just stop  doing it. 
[00:37:00]  The court provided  chilling details  of what had been  going on  in their duplex.  Defendant  intentionally traumatized  his wife  a woman of Jewish origin  born in Nazi  occupied Holland  with swastika  adorned articles  and notes  affixed around the home  and became enraged  when she removed them.  He ignored her need  for support and assistance  when she underwent  surgery and treatment  for breast cancer.  He systematically  cut off her access  to marital funds  and credit  as a means  of psychological abuse. 
[00:37:30]  That sounds like  lawyer babble  right there  that last sentence.  Because what are you  supposed to do?  Let her keep using  the credit cards?  Oh wow.  I can't tell you  how quickly I called Amex.  Oh hello  American Express  I'd like to cancel  a card please.  Not before a  cruise went on it though.  But I was reimbursed.  Thank you Opie.  Yeah she decided  at one point  to take  Opie's ex  on a cruise  on my dime.  That was nice.  It was nice of her  wasn't it?  You need a money back? 
[00:38:00]  Opie paid for his  his half of it.  Didn't pay for mine.  You know I had to  on that cruise.  Well your ex  was a lovely lady.  I lived  I learned.  You live  you learn.  You call up  immediately.  Gentlemen  if you're  considering divorce  I'm doing a public  service right now.  If you're considering  divorce  don't do  what I did.  If you're considering it  and seriously  like you're gonna do this  don't dilly dally  don't dilly dally 
[00:38:30]  take the initiative  do everything  possible  to protect  your assets  cut off  all credit cards  all this  marital  asset stuff  get your hands  on it  get your mitts  on it  because that's  how it's gonna  start with her  doing that  so you do it  then go  blow up your  building  Stephen from  Bayshore  another John  Sterling impression  he also yelled  the Barth  TNT  no  TNT

[00:39:30]  end here  this is some  good stuff  Bartha  in his email  insisted his  wife wasn't  entitled to such  a generous  settlement  because she  quote  had only  one responsibility  and she  failed  he expressed  she was supposed  to educate her  children  I do not think  a cook  and a seamstress  is a very good  result  didn't they want  to be like  she wanted to  open a restaurant

[01:04:30]  up  guys  man  I  worked  in  local  news  for 15  years  and  the  pathetic  thing  about  all  this  is  that  you  know  a lot  of  these  stations  especially  around  the  Midwest  they  can't  compete  with  the  Big  Apple  so  they're  going  to  try  to  local  the  story  somehow  by  saying  that  Cordula's  brother's  sister's  former  roommate  Tabard  Dasher  went to  community  college  in  Dubuque  for four  months  and  that's  their  local  story  it's  ridiculous 
[01:05:00]  as bad  as the  local  news  got there  it's  even  worse  in the  Midwest  it's  called  the  local  angle  all the  big  stories  you gotta  have  the  local  angle  the  consultants  that tell  you to  do  that  are  retarded  they're  the  worst  we  call  them  what  do  we  used  to  call  them  when  the  insultant  would  come  in  and  try  to  tell  us  how  to  do  radio  consultants  are  useless  I have  an idea  useless  in radio  useless  in TV  useless  in any  any  business  out  there  they gotta  justify  the  5,000 
[01:05:30]  bucks  that  they're  charging  to  tell  you  you  suck  let's  get  a  consultant  CBS  could  do  it  and have  a  consultant  come  in  here  and  then  we  could  just  humiliate  them  that  sounds  like  a  lot  of  fun  unless  you've  been  through  it  yeah  we've  done  the  consultant  thing  this  guy  would  come  into  Worcester  like  once  every  six  months  and  then  sit  down  with  you  and  tell  you  everything  you're  doing  wrong  because  if  he  came  in  and  told  you  how  great  you  were  and  how  good  the  show  was  he  wouldn't  need  him  you  wouldn't  need  him  yeah  so  the  consultants  are there  to point 
[01:06:00]  out  how  badly  you're  doing  no  matter  what  yeah  or they  don't  get a  paycheck  that's  why  consultants  stink  oh  the  early  days  of  radio  god  i  forgot  about  that  i  never  had  to  deal  with  sit  there  like  sit  in  the  chair  and  you're  being  you're  being  graded  on  your  performance  and they  play  tapes  you go  stop  the  tape  listen  one  of  your  breaks  and go  i think  you went  a little  long  talking  about  that  subject  or  you know  you gotta  you gotta  hit the  subject  really  quickly

[01:10:30]  anthony  show  want to  thank  john  just  john  from  boston  for being a buzzkill today.  Trying to have a little fun as people go to work.  He writes on the instant feedback,  oh my, I'm so...  And he writes so in capital letters,  oh my, I'm so upset that New York wins  the People Blowing Up Buildings Contest. 
[01:11:00]  You can keep that, and before you ask,  you can keep the airliners crashing into buildings ground too,  jackasses.  Fine, if Boston keeps the...  We don't screen people when they go through the...  What is the word? I'm so stupid.  Airport security.  Thank you.  Yeah, John, where do you think those planes came from?  He's from Boston.  A couple of them, anyway.  I'm going to have to over-explain again,  but John, just John, we're just trying to have a little fun.  I'll over-explain John, just John.  You're a douche.  People have miserable lives. 
[01:11:30]  They're in their cars.  They just want to be entertained  and laugh a little on their way to work.  John.  Were we having a People Blowing Up Buildings Contest?  No.  I don't think we were.  John, just John.  His name should be...  Can we?  Just douche.  From time to time,  we talk about the kook that is in New York City,  and then we ask the rest of America  if they got a bigger kook.  Match it.  That's all it is, John.  Hey, John, why don't you get AIDS, just AIDS? 
[01:12:00]  Go listen to something else.  I'm sure the Hillman has a terrific Mantown bid  you can check out.  There you go.  This is the Opie and Anthony show.  Oh, he's in Boston.  He can't hear it.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  And hookers are back in New York City.  Can we talk about this, John?  Check with John, just John.  Speaking of John, well, you know.  That's a good one.  I like that little morning zoo segue. 
[01:12:30]  Why is WB still showing a hot chick in a helicopter  that's not flying?  Why is this bitch doing a traffic report  just sitting in a helicopter that's not in the air?  New York's WB11 news.  The worst.  Now, the WB is all over the place,  and I'm sure they have the WB news in every city.  In your town.  In your town.  It is so awful.  It is so awful.  But it does have the hottest traffic chopper girl  ever in the history of traffic chopper girls. 
[01:13:00]  All of them are good looking.  She used to work at the Islander games.  Did she?  Oh, yeah.  And all the women that went to the games  with their husbands and boyfriends  would get pissed off  because she would walk around NASA Coliseum.  And, you know, the Islanders trying to get  a family atmosphere here or there,  so there's a lot of young kids.  And she would do, like, reports from the stands.  You know, every hockey team has one of these hooas now.  Sure.  And she would show off her huge implants,  no bra, low-cut outfits,  and everyone's head would turn as she walked by, 
[01:13:30]  and you could see the women just getting pissed off.  Couldn't give the sneak peek?  No, there was no reason to sneak peek.  She was so ridiculous as far as exposing what she had.  And there's nudie shots of her out there, right?  Yeah, she posed for Playboy.  Yeah, Playboy.  And now she's the traffic girl  on Channel 11 News here in New York.  And now she's hoping everyone forgets  that she actually started out as a hooah  sitting in a parked helicopter.  How worthless. 
[01:14:00]  Hi, I'm in Chopper 5.  I don't know why I'm yelling.  The rotors aren't turning.  She annoys me.  Why isn't the helicopter running?  What is she going to do in it?  Ah, sometimes she should give the weather  in the helicopter like Omar did.  Sometimes the wind conditions aren't right.  Very good.  All right.  I never trust our weather.  Here's me explaining why that happens.  Who cares?  You're right.  I stink.  I should go home.  Some Asian woman should throw a pointy hat  into the door.  It's a flare! 
[01:14:30]  Not as good as you, Lance!  Have a sip of coffee, throw the flare out.  I think, bitch, it's just a flare!  She was in Playboy.  I think we said that, right?  Yes, we did.  All right, maybe...  Is that John Just John?  Yeah.  Shut up.  I want this girl in the helicopter,  which I went, shall we dance to play?  The whole time she's talking.  All right, hookers are back.  That's right, for eight people out there. 
[01:15:00]  Yeah.  The hookers are back in an area of New York City  that, look at me over-explaining again.  Boy, that's in my mind all morning.  Why?  That used to be called Hell's Kitchen.  Hell's Kitchen.  How long ago was it called Hell's Kitchen?  One of the greatest names for a community.  Hell's Kitchen.  Yeah, but it didn't really shed a good light on...  It's not a name that...  It's one of those names that,  if you're in World War II,  and you're telling people where you're from,  I'm from Hell's Kitchen.  That's cool.  Because all the immigrants went there, 
[01:15:30]  they were living like 12 in an apartment.  Yeah.  No AC.  It was Hell's Kitchen.  There was no bathrooms.  All the old guys talking about it.  All kitchens.  Just kitchens.  And it was Hell.  I think it should still be called Hell's Kitchen.  You know why they changed the name, right?  Because of exactly what you said.  Yeah, it didn't sound fun.  And people couldn't get a lot of money for their places  when they wanted to sell and get the hell out  because who wants to live in Hell's Kitchen?  So they renamed the area Clinton.  Clinton.  Clinton.  I haven't Clinton needed it.  A nice, safe, white name. 
[01:16:00]  How long did they do that?  Iraq, get on that.  Quickly.  Educate me.  How long ago?  I don't think it's that long ago.  About five years, six years?  It could be longer than that.  I think it's longer than five, six years.  Does Ben know?  Five or six years?  It's recent.  It is pretty recent, I'm telling you.  Is it?  Yeah.  And there's Chelsea.  And then the old school people that live in that area,  they're...  I've got to say ten years.  No.  I've got to say ten years.  I would say six tops.  I bet it has something to do with the Clinton administration  because Chelsea is right below it. 
[01:16:30]  And it is.  No, no.  Chelsea and then Clinton.  And then there's one little community center.  It's the Chelsea-Clinton Community Center.  Really?  Because it's Chelsea and Clinton.  Yeah.  Is domineering Dyke Hosebag also with fat calves?  Fat cankles is right above it.  Can't keep track of her adulterous husband.  Yeah, boy.  Ville.  She'll do a good job keeping terrorists out.  She couldn't keep a fat intern off her husband's hog.  Yeah.  That's the woman you want running the country.  Stupid token.  I don't want to keep going to the WB news, 
[01:17:00]  but why do they have what is known to white trash,  Coliseum-going people as Carasaurus crushing a WB11 news car?  What's a Carasaurus?  It's something that they do at the truck shows.  You know, the people that are really interested in who wins,  Bigfoot or Gravedigger kind of people.  And it's like this big fire-breathing mechanical dinosaur thing  that breathes fire and eats the car.  And they're doing it on a news show. 
[01:17:30]  Ew.  Like, this is going to get people to tune in that want their news in the morning.  I only want to see Carasaurus if it picks up a family of 11 in a minivan.  By the way, here's your traffic girl.  Holy moly.  There you go.  Topless.  There you go.  She wants everyone to forget that she did this.  She is sexy.  He's eating the car and the people in it.  Wow.  They got a camera from behind, too, that's showing on the TV monitor in this picture. 
[01:18:00]  You see that?  Oh, I did.  Yeah, you threw your picture away too quickly.  Look at what she's doing.  Oh, she's getting ready for some type of examination.  Oh, jeez.  There you go.  That's what you want from your traffic girl.  Looks like we're sailing through the tunnel.  No tie-ups there.  No tie-ups in the old Holland Tunnel, huh?  That's wonderful.  Hopefully not.  Hopefully there's not a backup.  A big rig backing out. 
[01:18:30]  But I guess it's okay if you did this in your past life to do traffic.  Yeah, why not?  She's definitely not going to sit behind an anchor's desk.  No, I think that...  They may give her weather, but after that, that's it.  A sexy weather girl.  That's it.  All right, hookers back in Hell's Kitchen.  It's pretty much a who cares story, but the hookers have been hiding for a while like cockroaches.  When Giuliani came and he cleaned up New York, and a lot of people were against it at first,  and then New York started making a lot of money, so a lot of people were for it.  One of the things he did with these quality-of-life cleanups, he'd go out and make sure the cops 
[01:19:00]  paid attention to squeegee guys, which were a pain in the ass.  They were at every bridge and tunnel, and at a stoplight, you'd stop, and some homeless slob  would come out with a dirty rag, wipe your windshield, and try to extort money out of you.  And I used to stop right before the Queensborough Bridge.  There's a light there in Queens Plaza, and roll up dollar bills.  This is when I was broke.  I did this for entertainment. 
[01:19:30]  I was in my Apollo air conditioning truck, and would throw dollar bills out the window  and watch them scurry through moving traffic.  Like, right when the light turned green, I would throw a couple of bucks out, two or three  dollars, and watch them run through moving traffic to try to get it.  It's hysterical.  And Giuliani cleaned all this up.  Homeless games are fun.  Hookers went away.  They're fun.  Of course they are.  They're a lot of fun.  Isn't that what they're out there for?  Hey, by the way, the pervs are all checking in. 
[01:20:00]  They're at their computers.  They want to know the traffic girl's name so they can enjoy the nakedness.  What the hell's their name?  Jill.  Who cares?  Well, they care.  They're pervs, and they need us.  Jill Nicolini.  N-I-C-O-L-I-N-I?  Something like that, yeah.  Yeah, God.  Look it up on Google Images.  She's lovely bosom.  All right, so the hookers are now around in the daylight.  Yeah.  Walking up to the cars with their little outfits.  Apparently they'd been around at night.  You know, I've heard from certain people that I sit next to on a daily basis. 
[01:20:30]  I wouldn't know about that.  My bank account won't allow it.  But now in daylight.  They used to be around in daylight.  West Side Highway used to see them walking around.  But now they're coming back out.  They're creeping back out in the daytime with their little shorts and skirts.  A lot of Asian girls, I guess, right?  That's what I'm saying.  Here's the bottom line with the government.  We are going to buy sex whether you like it or not. 
[01:21:00]  So if you leave the internet alone, that's where people will stay, in their homes.  If you continue to obsess over what we're looking at on our computers, then this is what's going to happen.  It's going to bleed back.  You want to keep going after porn.  You want to keep doing that.  Well, then don't snivel and belly egg when we go by to the street, you jackass.  And they don't give a crap in the end.  They just want to make – they just want their cut.  Turn a dime on it.  They just want their piece of the action. 
[01:21:30]  They make some money.  Oh, trust me.  They want to legalize prostitution.  Why can't women sell their flesh if they want?  They so want to legalize it.  Morally, they can't.  But they would love, you know, the piece of the action that it would bring.  We're so moral.  No, we're not.  We're such a moral country.  No, we're not.  It's fake morality.  No, we're good.  We're uptight.  And we'll get into that next with the online gambling thing.  It's fake morality that is going on in this country.  Hooker's back in Hell's Kitchen. 
[01:22:00]  Listen to this soundbite.  Longtime residents say they remember prostitutes in this area of Hell's Kitchen back in the 1980s.  They say now they're not happy.  America's oldest profession seems to have.  All right.  Hold it right there.  It's very disconcerting if you have to.  She says America's oldest profession.  Yeah, it's the world.  It's the world's oldest profession, you idiot.  America's oldest profession is slavery.  How about, yeah, slavery.  How about ship navigation to get here? 
[01:22:30]  It started with cavemen.  Right.  Anthrax distribution in blankets.  We did that before we did prostitutes.  Exactly.  Exactly.  America's oldest profession.  No.  Dope.  These news people just show on a daily basis that they're adults.  They're not happy.  America's oldest profession seems to have returned.  It's very disconcerting if you have to go somewhere with your children.  I have two girls.  And it's like, Mommy, she has no underpants on. 
[01:23:00]  What is she doing?  What's going on?  You have to explain this to your child.  Is that the greatest?  Wow.  She does the impression of the dumb kid.  What is that guy from Lucky Louie doing picking her up?  Mommy, she has no underpants on.  Wait, Mommy, why did I say she?  We've got to play that again.  We've got to play that again.  It goes somewhere with your children.  I have two girls.  And it's like, Mommy, she has no underpants on. 
[01:23:30]  What is she doing?  What's going on?  You have to explain this to your child.  Gwyneth Leach recently moved to Hell's Kitchen, charmed by a nearby park for her children to play in.  But she says she soon came to realize she was sharing her neighborhood with what she considers unwelcome visitors.  If you come out, let's go buy milk at 7 or 8 o'clock in the morning.  There are a lot of women working the streets and pimps standing on the corner.  And they come in apparently from out of the city in vans.  She says most of the scantily clad women can be seen strutting down the streets near West 47th and 48th Streets between 9th and 11th Avenue. 
[01:24:00]  Tell us exactly.  Thank you, stupid news lady.  The exact location of where to buy some.  And by the way, you're never going to hear a guy complaining.  Never.  You're never going to hear a guy complaining.  Maybe a gay guy.  But even the guys that are just in that area.  They don't care.  And they're not going to pick up a prostitute.  They kind of like seeing it. 
[01:24:30]  Hookers are funny to look at.  They kind of like seeing it happen around them.  They're funny to look at.  They're fun to look at and watch.  Some of them are just slobs.  Please, can we get audio of this?  I just saw it.  You saw that?  WB11 is actually faster on my monitor than it is on yours.  I see it first.  It said next.  Jazzy Julie.  Next.  DJ Jazzy Julie.  Julie.  Please, let's get that.  Yeah, they got one of their news whoas.  News girl.  Doing some morning radio. 
[01:25:00]  Doing a power 105.1.  Great.  Star's old place.  All right.  Oh, it should just be terrific.  I bet it's a lot of fun, though.  I bet we're going to have some laughs.  Wouldn't doubt it.  All right.  Here's the other clip.  The hot neighborhood is not cheap to live in.  Many saying they pay up to $3,000 a month in rent.  It's expensive to live here.  You need more law, obviously, more law enforcement.  Right.  And you could control it to a degree, but I don't think you'll ever be able to control it,  just like any other major city in the world. 
[01:25:30]  Right.  Long-time residents say hookers could be found all over Hell's Kitchen in the 1980s.  Right.  But that the so-called up-and-coming area was turned around with the arrival of families  and new developments.  No, it's the arrival of Giuliani.  The streetwalkers are once again back in business, partly because of the area's proximity to  the Lincoln Tunnel.  Sometimes they stop and play the loud music and stuff like that, but other than that,  they conduct their business just like everybody else.  Residents are hoping a bigger police presence in the area will help keep the women and their 
[01:26:00]  pimps away and help improve the quality of life for families in Hell's Kitchen.  Here's the problem.  If any of you stupid pimps are listening, tell your whores to stop blasting that stupid  at four in the morning on a Tuesday, and people won't complain as much.  Tell the dumb whores driving the trucks that you provide them with, and this is a business  decision, pimps. 
[01:26:30]  Tell them that they're bringing police heat down on you by doing that.  You're like a whore consultant.  I am.  I'm telling them what they're doing wrong.  Yeah.  If you're going to punch your bitch in the gums, do it in the privacy of your own vehicle,  not on 48th and 10th.  Phone books to the body.  Never the face.  Never the face.  Of course not.  Antennas to the back of the thighs.  Don't talk.  DJ Jazzy Julie's coming up.  Wait.  She makes me almost smile. 
[01:27:00]  Capable of smiling.  I'll know that.  Almost.  Oh, okay.  You said almost.  Julie Chang.  Oh, she's DJ Jazzy Julie.  I thought it was like a real DJ.  Are we taping this?  Yeah, we're taping this.  Oh, my God.  Julie Chang.  I thought it was a real DJ.  Did they give her a hip-hoppy name just for the story?  DJ Jazzy Julie.  Very topical in 2006 to give her a 20-year-old hip-hop name.  Oh, I hate Julie.  I hate this woman. 
[01:27:30]  What is her segment called on the news?  It's DJ Clue.  I guess he's doing his...  It looks like she does the lifestyle.  Yeah, he's doing the, I guess...  Oh, boy.  ...the takeover star.  Uh-oh.  All right.  Oh, I hate...  All right.  Well, I hear what...  This is awful.  What happened?  What happens to her when she gets there?  She was very badly raped, you see?  No, she's dead.  DJ Jazzy Julie.  Oh, that's awful. 
[01:28:00]  Wow.  DJ Jazzy Julie stinks.  Hopefully the audio is good.  It can't be good.  All right.  We'll step aside.  I want to see Jazzy Julie.  Bill Burr joining the program after the break.  We got a shame, shame, shame on you thing.  Oh, I love the shame, shame, shame.  We'll try to do that before we get out of here.  Also, online gambling under fire. 
[01:28:30]  You can leave us alone.  And more entries in the most annoying 30 seconds ever contest.  I think WB11's up for that.  Why don't you leave...  With the DJ Jazzy Julie segment.  DJ Jazzy Julie knows how to bring it.  Cool.  Wow, the names coming on Easter feedback are just brutal.  She's a pretty Asian girl.  Oh, no.  That's how the Julie laughs.  You ever see a soundboard come apart like that, man? 
[01:29:00]  Let's do the whole station.  Let's do it for Manny.  Let's do it for Star.  Sal.  I feel sorry for your program, director.  It says another instant feedback coming in.  You guys have to check out the WB website for the description of the Traffic Girls Just Jill stories.  Let's just say it ends with, there's not an assignment Jill will refuse. 
[01:29:30]  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I bet we can come up with one.  We certainly can.  Get on your knees and take a little shot of rain on the chin.  Okay, we got to take a break.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  Opie and Anthony are back.  Vincent's going to tell us what he learned this summer.  I spent three weeks with my Uncle Anthony, and I learned a lot from listening to his radio program.  First of all, women on the radio stink on ice, and all holes should be banned from the airwaves. 
[01:30:00]  Next, it's good to live amongst the Jews.  They have all the money, so they have nice houses, and the crime rates are low.  Opie's name is first because he saved my uncle from blue-collar hell.  Jimmy is a good egg, but I'm not allowed to be alone with him.  Opie and Anthony!  Ah, yes.  The Opie and Anthony show.  Me and Kenny were just talking get-nators.  Yeah.  That's all.  The dead man's switch.  Dead man's switch. 
[01:30:30]  Trying to figure out, you know, this guy, they're giving him a 20% chance of survival.  The guy, the doctor, blew himself up yesterday here in New York in the building.  And trying to figure out, because Opie's saying the guy's a doctor.  He should be able to inject himself with something if he wants to kill himself.  And make it easy.  And blow the building up.  He has such hatred in his soul and such anger.  Yeah, this isn't just about killing yourself.  This is about the way you kill yourself and the building coming down and everything.  But then we were trying to figure out how he would inject himself with some kind of thing 
[01:31:00]  that's going to kill him and detonate the building.  Like, you want to kind of be out before you blow up.  So you'd have to do a dead man's switch, which is like holding a button in your hand down.  When you let off the button, it blows up.  So when you pass out, you'll blow up.  And you won't know because you've been passed out.  But then Kenny brought up, what about the death grip?  You know, if you die and you seize up, you won't let go of that button.  So then I suggested the switch you stand on, like they used in that, the Chechnyans used 
[01:31:30]  at that Russian school, where they just stand on a switch so that if you get shot or move,  I had to stop the music.  The whole place blows up.  How did you know that?  Oh, they had a great documentary on it.  I just knew there was a big explosion, and it was unfortunate for a lot of people.  Three days.  You knew which switch they used?  I think it was Three Days in September.  It's a documentary that's on Showtime.  It's about that.  Yeah.  They just killed the rebel leader, too.  Yeah, they just nailed that guy. 
[01:32:00]  That's why Anthony ordered Showtime.  Yeah, he also.  Just for that.  He saw that documentary.  I've got to have it.  He also knows the name of the people, or what the job is called, of the people that put  the metal rims around old barrels.  The barrels?  You know what that is?  Yeah.  A cooper?  A cooper is a guy that made barrels back in ye olden days.  Yeah.  You and three guys know that.  I think it's because I went through my Renaissance Festival phase, where I used to go to a lot 
[01:32:30]  of Renaissance Fairs.  Used to, meaning last year.  Everybody knows, like, a blacksmith.  Yeah.  A couple of those old school jobs.  Oldie school.  He knows what a cooper is.  I learned from going to the old Bethpage Village Restoration.  Holy crap.  He probably sat there and watched somebody do, like, working with metal seminars.  Hey, why not?  You know we do a show with a nerd, right?  Yeah.  I'm not a nerd.  I'm a borderline geek. 
[01:33:00]  You're far from a shock jock.  I'm borderline geek.  You're a nerd.  You're a nerd.  No, I'm not a nerd.  I'm borderline geek.  But I have no interest in comic books or things like that.  But I kind of like, you know, dude, you're a nerd.  You really are.  I'm not a nerd.  Or you want to make sure people know that you're smart.  Nerds are different.  Because you never got the high school diplomas, and now you're like, well, but I'm going to  show people how smart I really am.  I was fun and smoked pot in school.  It can't make me a nerd.  Picture bringing that up. 
[01:33:30]  That conversation up on a first date.  Just bringing up, you know what a cooper is?  I would never do that.  How a conversation with Bill Burr turns into the same conversation I'd have with a first  date.  Bill, don't flatter yourself.  Okay?  Oh, this is great.  Jesus.  This is what we want to hear.  Go ahead, Jeremy.  I'm trying to insult you.  That's all I'm trying to do.  Jeremy.  Good morning, boys.  Good morning.  I want to defend Anthony. 
[01:34:00]  It's not that he's that smart.  It's just you guys are really just that much more stupid.  Attaboy.  All right.  Wonderful.  I'll accept that.  All right.  So moving on with the program here.  A couple things.  You're in for Friday night?  Yeah.  Are you in for Friday night?  No one's asked me anything about Friday night.  Oh, I haven't even asked her yet.  Jesus.  Late night karaoke at my brother's restaurant.  What time?  10 o'clock.  I'll have sets.  You could do a set at the restaurant. 
[01:34:30]  Hey, there you go.  Well, because you have to be on a stage.  I understand that.  So you do a set, and then we'll do late night karaoke.  Ladies and gentlemen.  I'll give you a few bucks.  Live from FH Riley's in beautiful Huntington, Long Island.  Jimmy Norton.  I don't know how to sing.  You should come, though, because we had a great time the last time.  We're going to do it again.  Late night karaoke at my brother's restaurant, FH Riley's, 400 New York Avenue in Huntington Village. 
[01:35:00]  Only if I can find a girl to sing that Atlantic Star song with me.  Which one's that?  More than a woman should be.  Always.  It's a good song.  I want to sing that.  Oh, Always?  Yeah.  That was a good version.  Yes.  I really conveyed the song well.  I'm getting a lot of free stuff together to give away at karaoke night.  Are you?  So be there or be square.  Yeah, we had a lot of fun last time.  We're going to do it again.  Keep on trucking. 
[01:35:30]  If this van's a rocking, don't come knocking.  Gas, grass, or ass, I'll behave like one.  Be there or be square.  High school graduate of 74.  Yeah, look at him.  Really.  I'm the guy who ruined your book by writing upside down.  Hey, you jive turkeys.  Up all your noses with rubber hoses. 
[01:36:00]  My brother's joint is small, so we're not going to promote this.  Oh, don't talk about his.  Oh, okay.  Oh, no, no.  You meant the establishment.  No, the Hughes.  All right.  The way you put it.  No, the Hughes boys, we're all blessed.  Oh, are you?  Yeah, we're all blessed.  I've seen some evidence.  Wow.  You've seen my thing?  No, no, no.  Just, you know, sometimes you wear the right outfit.  Remember I saw you in the, remember you dressed like Elvis that day?  And he came in with the snuggly fitting bodysuit. 
[01:36:30]  Wearing spandex.  Anyway, so we're not going to promote it a lot because we can't.  It's a small joint.  It really is.  FH Riley's 400 New York Avenue in Huntington Village.  We'll do late night karaoke this Friday at 10 o'clock.  Get the word out there.  I'm sure just by that word, it's packed.  10 to 10.  It's done.  That's it.  And we're trying to collect a bunch of, you know, stuff to give away.  We're just doing it to have fun.  Yeah.  All right.  With that said, we've got Bill Burr in studio.  He's got a big guy. 
[01:37:00]  Hello, Bill.  Wait, you're there tomorrow night, Bill?  Yeah.  Tomorrow I'm in Providence at the Comedy Connection.  Then Thursday I'm in Saugus at the Kowloon.  Going to be doing jokes while people eat poo-poo platters.  Oh.  And.  That's that Asian comedy joint.  Yeah.  One of the staples of comedians.  Are they big clubs or no?  Those places like large seating wise or no?  Yeah.  The Comedy Connection in Boston on Friday, Saturday night is a big one.  That's a good club.  And then, of course.  First time you're headlining the Comedy Connection in Boston. 
[01:37:30]  That's very exciting for Bill Burr.  My big homecoming.  Right.  And the O&A pest in the Boston area should go out and support Bill.  You're not going to be disappointed.  Comedy Connection this weekend with Bill Burr in Boston.  Is that really a compliment?  You're not going to be disappointed?  I've heard it used as a compliment many times.  But it's like, well, I wasn't disappointed.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like you left.  It's not going to totally suck.  Yeah.  You didn't feel pissed that you went.  Bill Burr.  Better than AIDS. 
[01:38:00]  That's one of the best clubs in the country, man.  The Connection in Boston.  Oh, yeah.  It really is.  Bill Blumenreich.  Can never say his last name right.  Blumenreich or Blumenreich.  He's a fan of the show, and he runs a good club up there.  How about just Bill?  How about Bill?  Good old Bill.  All right.  Online gambling.  They're out of the game with this crap.  Why are they going after this?  They're out.  Because they got to.  They got to get into everybody's pocket and then up everybody's, you know, that I can't 
[01:38:30]  say here, god damn it.  But they got to get up.  They got to crawl in there with a flashlight and look around.  Can we just enjoy ourselves without the government stepping in on everything we do to protect  under this guise of protecting eight people that have problems?  I don't care if we might as well run the story first.  Run the story.  All right.  And then I could get livid.  Oh, you're sweet.  So lawmakers could pull the plug on gamblers who prefer their laptops over casinos. 
[01:39:00]  The House plans to vote today on a bill that would ban credit cards and electronic transfers  for paying for online bets.  That would essentially shut down gambling websites.  One expert says for gamblers, the Internet is like crack cocaine.  One click of the mouse and you'll lose your house.  Opponents say policing the Internet is impossible.  Others complain the bill doesn't cover all forms of gambling.  Sounds like we're going to lose this one, right?  No, you won't.  Then they'll find a way for you to buy something that you can gamble two steps later. 
[01:39:30]  These scumbags.  Just keep out of people's personal lives.  Here's what I do now.  I go to a gambling site.  I play poker on it.  And it's a lot of fun.  If there's nothing to do, sitting around, maybe there's nothing really good on TV, I'll  play a few rounds of Hold'em with people around the world.  Government's not making any money off that kind of gambling.  That's exactly what it is.  They want you to go to the casinos where it's taxed and they can make some money. 
[01:40:00]  Because I'll tell you, when you go to the casino, once you pull that arm on the thing  you put the course in, whatever the hell it's called, the slot machine, just like crack,  just like crack, there goes your house.  What a bunch of asses.  Just leave us alone to gamble.  If a few people can't deal with it and they run up their credit cards and go broke and  end up homeless, why should that affect everybody?  That a few people can't deal with whatever it is, gambling, booze, that everything, porno. 
[01:40:30]  You're playing into their hands, though.  They don't care about that angle of this.  They just want the tax money.  But they're saying they're doing it because people are losing everything.  I'm playing into it because that's the angle they're taking.  The government doesn't care that you're losing everything by gambling.  They just want their peace.  They care about you?  Do you think they honestly care that we've got to stop this because people are losing everything?  They're stupid.  Your government doesn't care about you. 
[01:41:00]  Why don't they ban alcohol?  I mean, how many children are killed drunk driving?  If you're going to go have to gamble, just go grab some food.  Alcohol and cigarettes.  Alcohol.  Go ahead.  Drug.  Ban them.  There has never been anything on this planet more deadly than smoking.  And cigarettes are sold.  But they'll recall like a toy if one kid gets a scratch from it, like they recall it.  But, like, cigarettes and booze, for some reason, is off limits.  Well, you know, big business, Ant.  You know who gets screwed? 
[01:41:30]  The little guy.  The little guy.  Cigarettes seem to do a lot more damage than gambling.  Than the gambling does.  They're predicting in the next century one billion dead from smoking in the next century.  One billion people dead.  Yeah, they would have died of something.  Yeah, of course.  And who the hell needs them here anyway, right?  Exactly.  You let them smoke, you let them drop off the planet.  And I got to tell you, it opens up some fine apartments here in Manhattan.  That, too.  A little earlier than the...  Yeah, they all stink like smoke. 
[01:42:00]  By the way, whoever's smoking in this bathroom, I hope you get prostate cancer of the mouth.  It's filthy in here.  Prostate cancer.  I had to...  Dr. Norton.  I had to watch...  On an all-new house.  Prostate cancer of the mouth.  House must cure this.  It's a disease he's never seen before.  I've never seen this disease.  In an all-new house, he has to kill five children to save one.  Does he?  Sam, we gotta find out where it's coming from, Sam.  Why is Quincy on an episode of House? 
[01:42:30]  I don't know.  But why do I think I'm doing Quincy when I just put my fingers together where no one can say it?  It's a visual gag on an all-new house starring Jim Norton from Lucky Louie.  It's actually John Quincy Adams.  That is...  LOL.  No.  I had to wash my fruit.  I was eating fruit.  The irony of me washing fruit.  What was his name?  Yeah, you had to wash my fruit.  You had all sorts of problems trying to wash your fruit today.  I had to wash my fruit, which is ironic because I laugh at condoms. 
[01:43:00]  I don't wear condoms, but let me wash those shrubberies and blueberries.  Yeah.  So I had to go in the other bathroom, and it just reeked in there.  So I look in the mirror, and I look under the stall, and I see a pair of sneakers.  And that's what I have to smell while I'm washing my fruit.  Some awful man.  What's going on in there?  I don't like it.  But this bathroom is atrocious.  When is this show finally going to throw our weight around?  Soon.  Give us a full book.  Soon.  Then we'll become the pricks everybody knows we are.  Soon.  We got to just make believe we're all equal for a little longer. 
[01:43:30]  You don't believe that?  And I guess that was long enough.  Nah, we'll make believe.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Guys sound good.  No, I ain't team.  No, really.  Love the alienation.  Love the alienation.  It's always been a treat in the workplace.  Oh, it's fun for me. 
[01:44:00]  Well, that's just it, Opie.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  So whatever Opie does, it's Opie and Anthony.  O and A.  It's fun for me.  I'm a douchebag by proxy.  Well, guys, we got the audio of Robo, Robosaurus is what it's called, that you were explaining  earlier.  Oh, it's Robosaurus.  We're fascinated by the traffic girl on WB-11 because she's just sitting in a helicopter  on a, what are they called, helipad? 
[01:44:30]  Helipad.  And doing the traffic.  She's not doing the traffic from the helicopter in the air.  She's doing the traffic in a helicopter on the ground.  On the ground.  And you can feel the trailer behind her.  Yeah, she looks ridiculous.  She's got the headset on.  Oh, it's the greatest thing.  The only thing that can make me happier is if she was decapitated like Vic Morrow.  Getting out.  It's like Tara Reade.  She doesn't want to go up in a helicopter.  Oh, you guys, it's so much fun. 
[01:45:00]  I'm going to play it.  I'm going to play it.  Traffic reporter for a day.  And I'm going to go up in a helicopter.  It's going to be so much fun.  I'm going to go.  And I'm going to tell you guys the traffic is.  Okay.  Oh, you're going to start?  Look, guys, I don't want to do this.  It's so scary.  It goes up.  How high is it?  No, I thought it was just going to be like a foot or two.  But if we could do it on the ground, I'm just going to do it.  Can I get a Cosmo over here and stuff?  And my friends would just drink and you guys too.  Tara, now you've got to tell everyone how much fun it was, even though you didn't even do it.  It was so awesome to watch the helicopter take off and see my friends there. 
[01:45:30]  And then we hung out at the bar and partied all night.  And I had sex with like 18 guys.  I woke up in a hotel room that smelled like smoke and I can't even breathe or talk or nothing.  Welcome to Tara Dive.  Why did they take that show away from us?  Gold, you idiots.  You took away gold.  Why did you take it away from us?  Let's say hi to John in Jersey.  John.  Hey, I've got to say, Anthony, you are quick.  Uh-oh.  You've got no response on that line.  You said one click of the mouse and there goes your house.  And you said, it took over two seconds, but you said, doctor. 
[01:46:00]  And he just steamrolled right over you.  It wasn't that good, sir.  I didn't hear it, sir.  And now I look back, I don't really regret not hearing it.  And you're making it sound like it's Woody Allen's moose bit.  Why don't you shut up?  I heard that moose bit.  I don't think it's that great.  Oh, please.  I'm going to have to listen again.  It's the Mona Lisa spoken.  Oh, it might have been good back then.  That's what I'm thinking.  Maybe it was good back then.  No, it's still good.  Robosaurus audio from the WB-11. 
[01:46:30]  Let's get into it.  I mean the Berkowitz's.  Should we over-explain this again?  You see these things that the monster trucks show.  Of course.  And they look like dinosaurs.  They pick up cars and they breathe fire and they smash the cars.  Oh, it's wonderful.  And the children just yell and scream.  They enjoy it.  Ooh, who's winning this time?  Chevy or Ford?  Ooh!  Cares.  In the meantime, rev up those engines.  Rev up!  Bob is hanging out at a raceway park trying to escape the very dangerous, treacherous Robosaurus. 
[01:47:00]  Run!  I wish it came after him.  I think that's the best advice you've given all morning long, Linda.  By the way, I'm in our executive producer's car.  I thought we'd be safe.  Kenny, is he toying with us?  I don't think so.  Let's get out of here.  Run!  Oh, it's getting hot!  Run, run, run!  Robosaurus once again!  Oh, I don't think that's going to work, Kenny.  Uh-oh.  Here he comes.  He does this every year to us, Kenny.  Oh, boy.  Tell me about this guy.  Why does everybody like Robosaurus? 
[01:47:30]  I'm just buying the beat.  No, he's a hero.  Tomorrow night he's going to be a great show now.  Oh, my God.  Okay, terrific.  Yeah.  That's how Brokaw started.  Exactly.  Oh, my goodness.  Robosaurus is coming out.  He's breathing fire.  Are we in the producer's car?  Because we've got to get out of here.  Rather, let's go run.  Dan?  Yeah, Tom, it looked just like the producer's car.  It didn't look like a real old car that they didn't mind destroying, by the way. 
[01:48:00]  Some old car that was just painted up with a big WB logo.  No, it looked just like a brand new car that a producer would be driving.  Boy, you tricked me.  You tricked me.  Oh, Pontiac Sunbird.  Right.  We got the producer's car here.  Yeah, they quickly repainted.  We're in the logo on it.  With the hangar antenna.  With the hangar antenna.  With the hangar antenna.  Yeah.  Not many people would believe that the president and CEO of the network drove here in this Ford Pinto. 
[01:48:30]  But he did.  And now, run.  Oh, here comes the car source.  What's his name?  I have no clue.  Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News.  Car tragically destroyed by a mechanical device as I try to salvage my career.  Car source.  Run.  Run away.  It's coming.  I hate car source.  But if you love them, please show up at the NASA Coliseum.  Oh, it's RoboSaurus.  I suck.  Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News. 
[01:49:00]  Car source.  Yes.  You purchased the whole chair or the whole seat, but?  You'll just need the edge.  That's right.  You'll only need the edge.  Look at it as they pick up Leon Klinghoffer in his wheelchair.  RoboSaurus throws him over the edge of the Achille and Laro.  It's a terrorist.  Is it a terrorist robot?  We'll sell you at 11.  On WB News.  WB is a...  What are they doing with this publicity shit? 
[01:49:30]  They should not be allowed to call in a news program anymore.  No.  Is there anyone out there that looks at this stuff and...  Once they do it, it's not news.  They're showing all fat people.  Yeah.  Dr. Steve is getting...  It's uncone with Dr. Steve.  We're infatuated with the show.  He has a haircut like Stupid Hawk.  Oh, that's stupid Hawk, and you point right at him.  You're brutal, Jimmy.  It's the same, yeah, news program.  All these characters are on it.  The traffic...  Oh, the...  Uncone with Dr. Steve.  Yeah, no, they're not the same. 
[01:50:00]  WB11 takes the cake, and someone has to take their news thing.  No, I mean, all the things we're talking about are from this one show.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Exactly.  I'm sorry.  It's not a news show.  It's this...  Hey, guys, they throw it back so the studio can banter about what they just saw with RoboSaurus.  Oh, with RoboSaurus.  I don't know about you, Jimmy, but some of my best stand-up comes from the inspiration  of these newscasters just improvising.  Oh, yeah.  It's such a live moment.  Oh, they're so in it.  Inspirational.  They're having fun, and they're bonding.  And the spontaneity of their conversation is always spot-on fun. 
[01:50:30]  They always laugh only when it's funny.  They don't just force laugh.  You know what I love, too?  They're never uncomfortable.  No.  They're just so comfortable in their own skin.  And they could segue from something like this into a child death with no problem, without  it seeming odd or uncomfortable.  It's just terrific.  Let's listen in.  So, RoboSaurus, once again, has destroyed our executive cars for the WB11.  And it's back to you.  RoboSaurus is going to be a little bummed about that.  I think she might have to fire Larry for that one. 
[01:51:00]  I don't know.  She'll buy some new fancy car with that big jaw.  I'm like seven years old when RoboSaurus is on.  I'm like glued to the TV.  I love that thing.  I love RoboSaurus.  I do, too.  I can't get any of three.  That's awesome.  Oh, wow.  That was awful.  I could listen to these dope banter all day long.  She summed it up, though, at the end.  It was awful.  You heard her right there.  And we ask you guys out there in Radioland to send in your awful news banter.  We can't get enough of that crap from your local news.  They always do the shuffle. 
[01:51:30]  I just watch her do it.  Yeah.  Always.  What are you shuffling?  It's on a teleprompter, you whore.  Yeah, everything they say is on a teleprompter.  Shuffle, shuffle, shuffle, shuffle.  Shuffle, shuffle, shuffle, shuffle, shuffle, shuffle.  Bad banter.  Shuffle, shuffle, shuffle, shuffle, shuffle, shuffle.  And they don't even use the papers in front of them.  They all read it off the...  Of course they do.  They're just holding it because they're nervous.  I don't know what to do.  I have nothing to...  Shuffle, shuffle, shuffle, shuffle, shuffle.  Straighten them out.  OCT.  My favorite thing. 
[01:52:00]  They're playing with the mic stand.  Oh, is that what it is?  It's exactly what it is.  The stand-up comics equivalent is playing with the mic stand?  They're like, oh, God, that one didn't work too well.  That didn't work.  Shuffle, shuffle, shuffle, shuffle.  Shuffle, shuffle.  Robosaurus was acquitted of rape.  Shuffle, shuffle, shuffle, shuffle.  My favorite is the blank stare into the camera when they're supposed to go to a filmed piece.  Yeah.  And they go, we'll take you now to the Bronx.  And then they look and realize the clip isn't there, but they just stare into the camera until they realize, okay, we'll go to that clip later. 
[01:52:30]  And it's so uncomfortably long that you're just looking at them going, uh-oh, what are they going to do?  You know when you have that moment now was with digital cameras?  Remember the old days?  Hey, one, two, three, boom.  It goes.  Click.  You sit there after shows smiling in the dupe bag.  The phone.  Never knows to hold the button down.  Yeah.  You got to hold it down.  It didn't go.  Hold it down halfway for the autofocus.  Now, all the way.  Did it go?  No.  Okay.  Give it to me.  No.  No. 
[01:53:00]  Sometimes they're accidentally filming you.  So you're sitting there like smiling.  Did it go?  Did it go?  You're being videotaped.  I did that to a bunch of people on purpose with my camera.  Hilarious.  I was like, all right, yeah, we'll take a picture.  You know what my – so I go, just – I'm taking a picture of listeners.  So they'd pose at this event we were at, and I'd start videotaping them, and they're just standing there with a big, long, dopey smile on.  And they go, did you do it?  I was like, dude, I'm filming you, you ass.  I think it all embarrassed.  You're some dumb girlfriend with a stupid cell phone camera. 
[01:53:30]  I'm hitting – I'm hitting send.  Is that good?  Send.  Yeah.  That's going to look great.  Teach your broad how to use a – hold on, banter.  Shuffle, shuffle, shuffle, shuffle, shuffle, shuffle, shuffle, shuffle, shuffle.  That 0.5 megapixel camera where each person comes out as just two blobs of color, flesh, and whatever shirt you're wearing.  An Etch-a-Sketch is actually two megapixels.  Camera phones suck.  I will never use one, ever, until there are 300 megapixels.  Hey, Jim, as we go to break, we really got to take a break.  I'm shuffling.  Yeah, you shuffle to break for us. 
[01:54:00]  Shuffle to break.  Don't forget Bill Burr in studio.  It's a big gig for in Boston.  Comedy Connection all weekend long.  Shuffle.  Make sure you support Bill Burr at the Comedy Connection in Boston.  Website for other –  Shuffle, shuffle, shuffle, shuffle.  Bill Burr.com?  Yeah, billburr.com, myspace.com, slash, Bill Burr.  Shuffle, shuffle, shuffle, shuffle.  Jimmy, shuffle us to break.  Shuffle, shuffle, shuffle.  I have nothing to say.  Shuffle, shuffle, shuffle, shuffle.  Banter, shuffle, shuffle, banter.  Call the O.P. and Anthony Show right now, 866-313-3. 
[01:54:30]  O.P. and Anthony.  Yo, this show rocks.  Thanks, buddy.  Where are you calling from?  Thrasherville, USA.  And what do you got for the show?  Pain.  This place is painful enough, buddy.  If you have a point that's relevant to the topic at hand, call the O.P. and Anthony Show  at 866-313-3.  Rock.  The O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[01:55:00]  We're back with The O.P. and Anthony Show.  Hi.  Jim Norton just went postal.  Lost his mind.  All I saw was he was talking to somebody.  He then took his phone, which he's been having trouble with, and bit it.  He bit his phone and went into the bathroom.  He had a death grip on his cell phone.  Yeah.  Went into a death roll like a crock.  He seems better.  I bit it.  He seems better now, though, Anthony. 
[01:55:30]  Should be all right.  Are you okay?  Yeah.  I get concerned.  He washed his fruit.  He's very...  He washed his fruit in the weather.  We never got the fruit story, by the way.  Oh, yeah, you did.  No, because you wanted to wash it in there, but there's cigarette ash all over the place.  Then you had to go in the other bathroom, and someone was crunching as you were trying  to wash your fruit.  Right.  I'm looking at their shoes in the mirror under the thing.  Okay.  Trying to wash my blueberries.  Wash strawberries.  It sounded like the guy was around the campfire.  Let's just say I talked to Eric Logan, who I love, and I am biting my tongue, and I know 
[01:56:00]  you asked me to, and I will, but there's just somebody who I want to crucify.  I want to be so...  I won't say what it is.  I just want to be so vicious right now.  Give them 24 hours.  Yeah, give a timeline.  Give them 24 hours.  I'm not just fine.  And then blow up your building.  All right.  That's right.  I'll show them.  It seems to work.  Showing people.  Bill Burr helping out the show today.  I got to be honest.  The O&A traveling virus.  We got three dates so far. 
[01:56:30]  It's looking good that we're going to go to Cleveland with this show.  So, the ticket sales for the PNC Arts Center, great.  Yeah.  For the New Yorkers and the New Jersey people, great.  No problem.  Philly, forget about it.  The ticket sales, great.  Through the roof, Opie?  Through the roof for Kansas City.  Selling like what?  Flap jacks!  No problem in Philly whatsoever.  We're playing the Tweeter Center across the river there in Philly. 
[01:57:00]  Um, Boston.  What's going on?  It's actually not bad, but it's not as good as this.  What's going on?  We like to be honest on this show.  We're not happy with the ticket sales in the Boston area for the DCU Center show Saturday, August 5th.  I think because it's in Worcester.  Yeah, we had no choice.  We weren't allowed to do it in Boston because someone's holding a grudge up there still.  It's what?  It's Worcester, Boston.  Worcester, Boston.  Worcester, Boston.  No, see, it's Worcester or Boston. 
[01:57:30]  So we need to get the word out.  Even I know that.  It's Albany, Manhattan.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We need to get the O&A pass in the Boston area to get the word out.  We're not doing too good.  I'm not going to lie to you.  That's because it's actually the Worcester area.  Yeah.  That's a scary place.  But it's far.  It's kind of further away than we would have liked it to be from where our listeners base of operations are.  Don't worry.  We'll have a lot of cops in the area that day. 
[01:58:00]  You'll be fine.  As opposed to Worcester, Boston.  Right.  Like in the old days when we worked at AAF, we could sell Worcester real easy because it's a Worcester station.  Right.  And then they would try to do the Worcester-Boston.  Worcester-Boston.  Really?  It's like Chris Everett Lloyd.  But ticket sales are lame compared to Philly.  Philly is just kicking Boston's ass.  Yeah.  Of course, New York's going to be the number one because this is where we're based out of.  Philly, just unbelievable with ticket sales. 
[01:58:30]  Boston, really lame.  So I just want to pump this.  It's the DCU Center, Saturday, August 5th.  Fist.  Fist.  I'm having a tough time.  August 5th.  The lineup, Jim Norton, Bob Saga, Tracy Morgan, Bob Kelly, Ralphie May, Bill Burr, Patrice O'Neal, and Rich Voss.  Take us through Ticketmaster.com.  Go to OpieAndAnthony.com for all the info on the ONA Traveling Virus Tour.  Way back in the day, I used to perform out there in Worcester-Boston.  Yes.  At the Aku Aku.  Oh.  A little Chinese restaurant out there. 
[01:59:00]  Aku Aku in Worcester-Boston.  Never heard of it.  Yeah.  And just to add it to Sir Morgan's Cove, where we used to hang.  Good old Sir Morgan.  Me and Opie.  I never hung there either.  I just did the commercials for the rat hole.  I've never been there, so I have no idea.  But listen, listen.  So we got the, this just added to the ONA Traveling Virus.  The Drunk Clown.  Oh, no way.  Wait, wait.  Dunk Clown.  Dunk Clown.  What was his name? 
[01:59:30]  Yeah, but he sounds drunk too.  So yeah, the Dunk Clown.  Ah.  Oh yeah.  The Clown that's in the Dunking Booth and just, just.  Yeah.  And OzFest was great.  Just kills people.  He berates people so badly.  He does it better than anyone I've ever seen.  Yeah.  I've seen a few of these guys over the years.  But the guy that Bill Burr interviewed at, what was it, OzFest?  OzFest.  Last summer.  We got him for the tour.  He's going to do all three dates.  A 10 could walk by him and she'll leave crying because he could assault her so badly.  Yeah.  He needs security because people get that pissed off. 
[02:00:00]  Yeah.  And they're waiting for him to leave the Dunking Booth so they can beat him up.  Yeah.  So he's going to be part of the ONA Village that we're putting together.  I forgot.  You know how mad he made people?  He got people so mad that when they finally dunked him, like, I mean, like 40 people.  He was just like, yeah, yeah, that's you.  Like, just screaming at him.  Oh, it was great.  I forgot all about that guy. 
[02:00:30]  That guy's hilarious.  Let me show you how brilliant our listeners are.  Mm-hmm.  And we acknowledge that on a daily basis.  Jason from Rye.  August Fist?  That's what Howard's doing to his fans, right?  Yeah, that's what the Fist stands for.  So there you go.  Ticketmaster.com to get your tickets.  Opie and Anthony.com to get all the details on the ONA Traveling Virus.  We're really excited.  The comedians are really excited.  The ONA Village is coming together nicely. 
[02:01:00]  It's going to be a lot of fun.  August 5th, DCU Center for the Boston Worcester folks.  All right.  Roy, hey, I forgot to bring this to the table.  No, you didn't.  It's right there.  What?  Whatever you're bringing.  No, you're a free man starting today.  Oh, yes.  That's how we wanted to start the show.  Yeah, I know.  We got into other things.  But with the doctor blowing up his brownstone, you know.  The, yeah.  The family has moved on. 
[02:01:30]  They have left the building.  They have left my house.  Today.  After three weeks.  It's three weeks.  Yeah.  Thank you.  Thank you.  No more, um, no more little children hands.  Now I got to get the cleaning crew in.  No more photographs.  No more uploads to the internet.  Matt, you are terrible and disgusting.  No, no more, no more, um, smudged windows and, and, and, I, I, I actually had to, uh, wake 
[02:02:00]  up and as I was paneling in your basement, like those old Calvin Klein commercials.  No, no, no.  My basement is wonderful.  It's not yet finished.  Hey, can I back up?  It's spacious.  Can I back up?  Because, yes, Matt is right from Jersey.  Worcester is a bad neighborhood.  Have you been to Camden lately?  Uh, just updated.  Oh.  Have you been to Camden lately?  I broke my leg at a concert at the Tweeter Center. 
[02:02:30]  When I was in the hospital, I saw three gunshots and four stabbings.  Oh, that's wonderful.  These areas are well protected, though.  Yeah, we'll be fine.  Anyway, the house guests have left.  Yeah, they've left, you know, finally three weeks of little kids.  And I got kind of an idea, not that I had to take care of any children or anything like that, because I just don't do that.  I don't do it, but I got this little idea of what it was like to have kids in the house and what parents have to go through. 
[02:03:00]  A fraction of it is what I got.  What you're not getting is.  It's the sleep thing where they're just, they're crying.  But what you're not getting is it's different when they're yours.  No crap.  You have no attachment to these little rugrats.  I have little attachment to them.  They're cute.  They're like, one of them is my godchild.  Tell Bill and Jimmy about the one that came up to you last night and cried. 
[02:03:30]  And you didn't even have a special moment with the kid in three weeks.  So bad for the little kid.  Well, that's my godson.  See, as Anthony's doing the radio show, they are packing and they will be gone by the time they're gone.  No, they're gone already.  Oh, they're gone.  They packed last night.  So then I had to say goodbye last night to everybody, because I leave, you know, at an ungodly hour of the morning to come here.  It was before they left.  So I'm getting ready to go to bed, and little Christopher comes in, and I say, okay, well, goodbye. 
[02:04:00]  You know, thanks for coming.  And he just goes and starts crying and gives me a hug.  I would be, too, if I was leaving that mansion for the dump he's undoubtedly driving back to.  Jimmy, you live in a fine house in Colorado.  Yeah, just like your house, though.  I know.  Anthony's doing every video game ever.  Good job, Jimmy.  My father, while the way home, has to hear it.  How come you don't make as much as Uncle Anthony? 
[02:04:30]  Why do we have to have a house like Uncle Anthony?  Why don't we have a living room as big as a tennis court?  How come our house doesn't smell, no?  I had no furniture.  Why are our ceilings only eight feet high?  Why don't we have a Dominican cleaning up?  Right.  There were actually yesterday with one of these stuffed car things.  They were playing soccer in the living room because I have no furniture.  They played full court basketball.  And they were using the fireplace and two huge columns as the goals as they slid across marble floors. 
[02:05:00]  You were a beaten man.  You were like, you know what, kids?  Have fun.  And I'm just looking.  Reenact World Cup soccer.  I'm looking around going, oh, God.  When did you clean up Pro Cup?  Immediately.  Today?  Yeah.  Have you called them already?  No.  Well, then they're not going to be there when you get home.  Watch.  Watch.  He's swung by a whole depot.  Hey, Consuela.  In.  That's all I got to do. 
[02:05:30]  Clean.  Now.  Windows.  No, bring in a whole crew.  They bring in the crew.  They do all the vacuuming.  The mopping.  All the cabinets have to be wiped down.  I want everything wiped down.  They case the point.  I'm laughing.  I've had to open the refrigerator.  A refrigerator with a handle that goes from the top of the fridge to the bottom.  But, you know, you only use the part that's right in front of you.  Right.  But the kids are always touching that.  So I've gotten to the point.  Now it's a habit where I grab the top.  As high as you can. 
[02:06:00]  The tippity, tippity top of the handle to open up the refrigerator because I can't open  the pantry because the little pantry knobs.  The pantry.  It's a closet that stores canned goods.  Grow the f-  Grow up, Billy Burr.  Grow up, little Billy Burr.  With his Boston hat on.  You're an adult.  It's right next to the Davenport.  Sounds like the underwear you should be wearing.  The Davenport.  Listen, Anthony.  But see.  There are pantries.  But see, there's people out there that think we're shock jocks. 
[02:06:30]  We shouldn't be using words like pantry.  Any dump could have a pantry.  So I walked through the foyer.  We call it a cabinet.  The foyer.  I walked through the foyer and I was passing my pantry on the way to putting my pink socks  on.  So I sat down on the Davenport, removed my galoshes.  I had to walk through the mudroom to get to the pantry.  And then a large gentleman pushed my face into the duvet and taught me a real lesson.  We're shock jocks.  I don't take my things that cup of soup out of milk crates that are stacked up against 
[02:07:00]  the wall.  But a pantry?  Grow up!  Pantry!  A pantry?  What do you call...  That just sounds like pansy, doesn't it?  A closet in a kitchen or off the kitchen...  It's a place where a faggot should be hanging out in the closet in the kitchen.  ...that has canned goods in it.  It's called a pantry.  It's not.  Is it?  You're going to hang out in the parlor.  Exactly.  In the parlor.  I never said I had a parlor.  Is that what it's called?  Are you proud that you have a pantry?  Hon, could you bring somebody from the pantry? 
[02:07:30]  No, but I'm proud there ain't mice in it.  Speaking of which...  Speaking of mouse house.  Speaking of which...  My Polish...  Phew, the heat's off for a second.  You know when you're talking about the cleaning crew in the maze and stuff?  Yeah.  My Polish maid is there right now, and I forgot to tell you guys.  Every week, she ends up screaming.  Screaming from the mice, right?  She'll either find a mouse hiding in a corner somewhere or an oversized cockroach.  And these maids, especially in New York, they're used to seeing everything. 
[02:08:00]  She ends up screaming at least once while she's at my place cleaning up.  A roach?  A big roach?  Where?  Massive.  Bedboard?  Massive.  Water bug?  No, this thing...  Roach.  They're huge.  I had to kill one.  I had to take its head off.  City roach, you had to take its head off.  Yeah.  Where was it?  Like behind the toilet.  Like a Highlander roach.  As opposed to what?  Just breaking one of his antennas?  Just sending a message.  Send a message back to the rest of you.  You got till Tuesday to get out of here. 
[02:08:30]  It's more where that came from, Pally.  When this little kid walked up to you crying and sniffling, what was he saying?  That he was going to miss you?  He goes, goodbye, Uncle Anthony.  And I gave him a little hug, a little tussle.  A little hair tussle.  Huh?  Remember the Grinch when that little chick came walking up?  That's what this sounds like.  What, the little hoo?  The little hoo-whore?  Yeah.  Did those big eyes of yours go blink, blink, and get a little sad?  I had to go to bed.  I think I was like ten hands deep in a poker game.  Did you feel anything?  No, he didn't.  Did a kid make you feel anything?  Yeah. 
[02:09:00]  Mark grow three sizes bigger.  Three sizes bigger.  I felt...  Yeah, I did.  I felt like, oh, that's kind of sweet that the little kid kind of grew attached to the house  and, you know, us and everything.  That's the house.  And beat it.  You know, it was nice and stuff.  Yeah.  Oh, well.  I'll give you that.  And then it was like, all right, I got to get up at an ungodly hour.  Get out.  Keep quiet, kids, as you continue to act.  And shut up.  Quit yapping.  Bye, Uncle Anthony.  I hate you. 
[02:09:30]  No, I did not say...  Bye, Dirty Fingers.  I hate you.  I may have said Dirty Fingers under my breath.  Go back to your hovel.  No.  With your Dirty Fingers.  Hey, don't live in a hovel.  It's a wonderful place in Grand Junction, Colorado.  Oh, that place is a dump.  What, you've never been there?  Yeah, I've done community colleges there.  Morons.  Morons live out there.  Unbelievably stupid people with small houses and TV antennas. 
[02:10:00]  They're definitely going back to a dump.  They have satellite.  They don't.  And PlayStation.  We haven't said hi to Pittsburgh in a while.  Dave, what's up?  You're representing Pittsburgh this morning.  How you doing?  All right.  Hey, I just wanted to call and tell you guys, you're funny as hell, man.  Oh, thank you, sir.  I'll tell you.  Jimmy Norton.  He's a funny guy.  He cracks me up.  He's the one I look forward to.  Thank you, Dave.  Who doesn't?  It should be.  Godspeed.  All right, Dave.  I'm coming soon, Pittsburgh.  I'm just booking a date in the improv. 
[02:10:30]  It's going to be a lot of laughs.  Okay, cool.  You guys are catching on in Pittsburgh, I'll tell you.  Oh, we hope so.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  The excitement.  Oh.  Oh.  And that's the music saying we have to go.  Ready for a little walk.  Bill Burr, the big plug.  Because most of our, not, well, how much of our audience leaves?  I was going to say most.  That's not true.  1%.  Is it half?  I don't know.  I don't know.  A big part of our audience is leaving us, so get the big plug in for this side of the 
[02:11:00]  Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah, Comedy Connection in Boston this weekend.  I'll also be in Providence in Saugus and in Newport, BillBurr.com, MySpace.com, slash  BillBurr.  Bill Burr is a comedian friend that comes on our show every so often.  All right, Anthony.  I was explaining it, Opie.  I have a thankless job.  I want to acknowledge that today.  We'll be doing stand-up in a pantry in Worcester, Boston.  Shut up.  Hey, we had a lot of fun.  We continue on XM in just a few minutes here with Bill Burr.  If you're not joining us, have a great day, and we'll see you tomorrow. 
[02:11:30]  We'll see you tomorrow, man.  That was the selling point on your house.  It has a pantry.  God's sake.  Opie and Anthony XM 202.  The Opie and Anthony XM walkover begins now.  Is that here, too?  Let's go.  Let's go to your right.  Hello?  Are we on the radio, Opie?  Yes, we are, Jimmy.  Hello, XM.  And hello, Fatso. 
[02:12:00]  Our buddy's out here.  Fucking douche.  One of the building guys.  The roly-poly douche.  The roly-poly douche.  What a douche.  He's out here looking at us, making sure we don't block the breezeway.  Stop trying to stand like you have dignity.  He's got his hands on his fucking hips with his awful blue jacket, his fat stomach, and  his bunt.  Hope he dies in a fucking plane wreck.  His bunt.  A Cessna accident.  A single plane accident inside of a bank. 
[02:12:30]  I think the Hulk is.  I think the Hulk is.  Are we back?  Now we're back.  Just when Bill Burr was about to smash somebody with a good line.  That's all right.  Let's.  Why would it work?  The roly-poly fatso.  Why would it work?  Why would it?  Why?  Oh, I think he just gave you the malikia.  The what?  I don't know. 
[02:13:00]  What's that mean?  The, uh, this.  I don't care.  Why is he fucking staring at us?  He flipped you the bird.  He knows we don't like him.  He flipped you the bird.  That man has a blue billet.  Blue blazer.  I can't even say.  That guy.  It's over.  He's got his hands on his hips.  Look at him.  That's right, fat fuck.  That's the official keep it moving, Paul.  That's right.  Keep it moving.  Stop having fun.  What a complete fucking asshole.  Stop trying to salvage your dignity.  You little fat cunt.  Hey, come on, guys.  He's just doing his job.  Good point, Bill.  Good point. 
[02:13:30]  Now?  No.  Hello.  There we go.  Okay, now we're on.  I'll tell you what's going on.  All right, what's happening?  I already have it figured out.  Because we have the. 
[02:14:00]  All right, we're back.  Listen, is this because of the jerk-off in our building?  Exactly.  No one wants to have fun anymore.  We used to have a great system with the XM building.  We had this, what, like dish that would hang out the window.  This little dish that would hang out the window for the 15 minutes. 
[02:14:30]  The island of the island of Dr. Moreau.  Maybe that we would do for.  All right, we're back.  On fucking road.  The building had a problem with the dish hanging out the window.  The dish wasn't bothering anybody whatsoever.  It made the walkover nice and easy.  We could broadcast.  He bitched.  He complained.  The building complained.  So now we got to throw, I think, the dish on the roof or something. 
[02:15:00]  Yeah.  I think they just stuck it out the window.  Just now.  Oh, there it is.  Yeah, see?  It's out now.  That's going to get us in trouble now.  Because now we had to work around the building because they're just buzz kills.  You should just have Master Poe lean out the window and hold it.  Yes, gentlemen.  My forearms are made of steel.  I don't want to say it on the air.  I can't even.  I gave my mic the seat because I'm going to throw it and break it.  I fucking hate that guy. 
[02:15:30]  It's unbelievable.  It's unbelievable all these people that have who cares jobs that have to justify their stupid salaries and their stupid jobs.  We weren't bothering anybody.  Savage animals.  Savage animals.  Yeah.  See the antenna sticking out the window?  I see the flagpole.  Oh, yes.  Oh, my God.  That now, for the time it takes to walk from that building to this building, upsets somebody. 
[02:16:00]  Wait a minute.  That little thing?  That little skinny thing?  That little thing.  It comes right back in.  The second we get to the door, it's back in.  But the fucking building cunt can't deal with it being there for that long.  That's on her tax return, too, wasn't it?  Yes.  Building cunt.  I don't know if it's a guy or a girl or what.  It doesn't matter.  What happened there?  Occupation.  Oh.  Wow.  Somebody got fired right in the middle of fried rice. 
[02:16:30]  I said, get the fuck out.  It's like, can't you just leave it alone?  Because it's something out of the ordinary, out of the everyday.  An antenna sticks out of the window.  Well, just know when they go back to that high school reunion, they have, hey, Bob, what  do you do for a living?  Oh, I'm a building cunt.  I'm a building cunt and I make sure the, you know, the antenna doesn't come out the window  every day.  Well, let's get in.  It wrecked the whole walkover today.  Jimmy gave up on broadcasting. 
[02:17:00]  I don't blame him.  That was awful.  Because now we have to, like, keep the antenna inside the building.  And so the signal craps out.  They're trying to figure out if they could put the dish on the roof now.  Jimmy's asking where the gas main is for the building.  It's getting a little scary.  And Jimmy's annoyed to begin with, so he didn't need that.  You mean just in general?  Oh, we didn't say goodbye to everyone that just did the walkover with us.  Sorry, guys, but we're just a little annoyed today. 
[02:17:30]  Continuing just a bit.  A couple was in a vestibule at St. Pat's doing ass sex.  Lick, lick, lick, lick, lick.  Sounds great.  Complete whores.  Opie and Anthony got this couple to have sex in New York's St. Patrick's Cathedral.  Desiccation against the church is disrespectful.  It's a true sacrilege.  It was just a joke.  Opie's fault again.  How can we blow up our lives today?  You rocking sex.  Glory, glory, glory, glory, glory, glory. 
[02:18:00]  Uh-oh, we're in it again.  They hire people who are artists to do a certain thing.  And then when they go too far, they suddenly wash the hands of them if they feel the heat is too heavy.  Opie and Anthony should not have been fired.  Technically, we didn't get fired.  They probably shouldn't have hired them in the first place.  Exiled radio hosts.  They had been fired in Boston after announcing that the mayor was killed.  Another prank.  And I go, Anthony, I got a great idea today.  We're going to tell the whole city of Boston that the mayor died in a fiery car crash while he was on vacation in Florida. 
[02:18:30]  What do you think?  Oh, my God.  Is this a bad one?  Oh, it just gets worse and worse.  Everything just went right down the crapper.  Can I just say fuck?  Yes!  The duo has signed on with XM Satellite Radio.  Thank God.  Yeah, we'll make it work.  Oh, what a glorious day.  It's all about me.  I play golf with old guys.  I am a grinning idiot.  Act, act, act.  Hey, it's Opie and Anthony.  We're back now with the new climate of the radio.  Ho, ho, Opie. 
[02:19:00]  Shut up!  Thank you.  You don't go to CNN for dick jokes.  Don't come to ONA for hard-hitting news.  I love Opie and Anthony.  I'm Opie and Anthony.  I'm listening to Opie.  He's a big and beautiful.  I don't know.  Your mom's box.  Do you need any of the show?  We stink.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Ooh, life's all e-fresh. 
[02:19:30]  Hi, everyone.  What a clusterfuck that fucking walk was.  Jesus Christ.  Douche bandit.  Yeah, this...  I gotta get the Lysol off of the...  I gotta tell because it's fucking soaked with Lysol.  Take it off and bang it on the edge of the console, Jimmy. 
[02:20:00]  I mean, your pants.  I gotta tell.  Gotta dry our mic windscreens off because they spray them with Lysol, which is good and everything,  but sometimes they're a little super saturated.  I am in such a fucking mood.  Of course, because they completely fucked our walkover.  Are we ever going to be able to have a walkover that isn't like that now?  I hate these cocksuckers that run this building and the other building. 
[02:20:30]  It is so easy to do a radio show, but it's the people around you that make it so hard.  These people that get in your way.  Just leave us alone.  Building guy, like Hope said, justifying his job.  And his salary.  You gotta get people to justify the job.  So what do you do?  What did you do today?  Well, there's a maple up on the...  What window was it sticking out of?  I was the buzzkill for the Opie and Anthony show.  The one right around the corner. 
[02:21:00]  I showed them.  Isn't that our window?  Yeah, but apparently this is part of the building, and the building has like some kind of...  Yeah, see?  Bill just got a big whiff of that.  Dry your mic thingy off.  With the mic on, yeah.  Hey, hold on.  We just...  God damn it.  I should have went to him.  There's a guy from Utah.  I want him to call back, please.  Why?  What did he say?  He said that he heard we were funny, he gave us a listen, excuse me, and we're not. 
[02:21:30]  Oh.  So I want him to call back, please.  Oh, darn.  I want to give him his say today.  But...  But...  Just one day?  I don't know.  I thought we had a fine show today so far.  Maybe he only heard the walkover.  Really?  I'm having fun.  He can shit in his hat. 
[02:22:00]  Let's say hi to George in Jersey.  George?  Hey, I just want to let you know, don't worry about the walkover today.  It was funny as shit.  Every time he lost it, and they went to the Van Halen, oops, we ran out of dump music at  N.E.W.  Yeah, that's old school.  We did go old school on you.  It's funny once, if they screwed up every day, then, yeah, you've got to go to building  time and say, you just bought social listener in Utah.  That was for the old listeners right there.  We don't even need to explain, but I'm glad you enjoyed that.  Thanks.  All right, bro. 
[02:22:30]  Scrambled.  It's just amazing, though.  We had a really good first half of the show.  We were feeling good.  Feeling good.  We were ready for a nice walkover, and then, you know, of course there's a problem.  Keep it going, though.  Keep it going.  As soon as it's taken out of our hands, there's always a problem.  We're professionals.  We will rise above.  Who's this?  Hello?  Yeah, who are you?  My name is Steve.  From Utah? 
[02:23:00]  Yeah.  Oh, there he is.  All right, what are you calling from?  You got a better phone?  This phone stinks.  At this moment, the caller cannot hear us.  Ross Jim loses his fucking mind.  Back to the caller.  All right.  Steve, so why are you calling us today?  I thought I'd give you guys a listen.  I heard y'all was funny as hell.  I listened to Bob and Tom for a long time.  Oh.  You obviously have impeccable comedy taste.  Yeah, okay.  You know good jokes when you hear them.  Hey, dude, you realize Bob and Tom.  Bob and Tom. 
[02:23:30]  Great.  Forget it.  Did you hear the...  I'm trying to make a point, and I can't even say their name.  Did you hear the funny Camel Toe song they played a lot, dude?  That was hilarious, right?  I should go home now.  You know, I've heard some shit that they've played, you know.  Dude, Bob and Tom blow.  They really do.  You know that, right?  They're hacks.  Yeah.  They're mid-market hacks.  They're on about 8,000 little stations across America.  They were never able to crack it in the big cities. 
[02:24:00]  So what's the reason?  Because they're hacks.  Even you guys are a listen, you know.  Because I heard y'all was funny as well.  All right.  So what didn't you like about our program?  When did you first listen to the show?  Yeah.  I've been listening to it for the last couple of days.  I hear a little bit of some old stuff that you rehash.  Uh-huh.  Like flashback stuff.  And I'm just beginning to listen.  And I'm just not hearing anything very funny.  Y'all are just kind of, I don't know.  Hey, Bob.  Trashing some old shit.  All right.  So why are you still listening, stupid? 
[02:24:30]  I'm a mess today.  I'm telling you.  Why would you listen more than once?  Stop trying the forced laugh.  Dude, stop.  Dude, dude, dude.  Stop the forced laugh because you're uncomfortable.  Let me just say this.  I'm giving you a fair chance, okay?  We don't want you to give us a fair fucking chance.  How do you like them apples, Steve?  Drive off a fucking bridge with a full load of fucking HIV-positive needles.  Do you understand?  And they all fall on you, stupid.  Do you understand we hate people that say, I'm just giving you a chance? 
[02:25:00]  We don't need you to give us a chance.  We have a huge fucking audience.  Like it or lump it.  Stick, dude.  Stick with Bob and Tom.  That's what I say.  That's your style.  You're a Bob and Tom type of listener, so go back to Bob and Tom.  What's that?  What's that?  I'm listening to you guys as proof that shit can talk on the radio.  That's funny.  Oh, that's great.  All right.  I forgot to put my laughing hat on, you cock.  Think of something really funny like that while you're fucking your overweight wife that 
[02:25:30]  you got trapped in a marrying.  Yeah, that's right.  Keep forcing the laugh.  Keep forcing the laugh, you fucking fake laughing jizzbag.  What's that, sir?  He hung up.  Good.  Faggot.  Keep listening, faggot.  In a truck.  And Steve.  Fuck your mediocre fat wife.  Steve, you're still listening.  Of course you are.  You couldn't hang with us.  You know it.  Tongue up.  Go back to Bob and Tom so you can listen to the latest parody song.  The fake laugh. 
[02:26:00]  I like the camel toe song.  Do you?  Ah, boy.  Did you laugh?  You're proof that shit can talk on the radio.  Yeah.  Really?  You were way over your head, Steve.  I believe faggot in a truck is playing on the movie channel tonight.  Oh.  I have to DVR it.  I get to sleep early.  You faggot in a truck.  We got dumps.  Wow.  That's it?  I'm sure Bob and Tom are nice guys, but they...  I've never listened to their show.  I could care less about them either way.  They've been doing it forever, but the problem is they've never done it in a big city. 
[02:26:30]  I thought every fist reference was going to be dumped.  No, it's got to be in some kind of context.  Let's go...  Yeah, man.  Yeah, listen to the fucking lawyers.  The way they were talking, it didn't matter what context.  Let's go to Mike in Kings Park, please.  Mike.  Hey, how you doing?  Hey, Mike.  What do you say to Bill?  Screw him.  Hey, Opie.  Yeah.  You're really screwing up today, man.  I am so full of snot.  I just want to blow my nose for the rest of the morning. 
[02:27:00]  Want to come up to my house and blow it on some of the windows?  It's me and three other people in America that are sick in the middle of summer.  Who gets sick in the middle of summer?  Yeah.  Fuck you.  Hey, I ate at your brother's restaurant, man.  It's really good.  Mike, let me tell you this.  I can't even hear.  I have so much snot in me.  To be able to speak correctly, you've got to be able to hear yourself.  Okay.  I'm frustrated and miserable because I can't freaking hear. 
[02:27:30]  You sleep with the AC on?  I don't know.  It's so funny.  It's so funny, man.  I did a poll yesterday, Bill.  Three other people sick in America.  That's it.  That's it.  No one gets sick in July.  Poll may have a plus or minus of 250 to 300 million.  I'm talking a basic cold.  That's it.  I know there's other sicknesses out there.  I'm talking a basic.  Who gets a cold in July?  No one gets a cold in July.  People that have allergies.  Is that a cold then?  I don't think so.  No.  It's the same symptoms, though. 
[02:28:00]  Eat your yogurt.  I'm trying.  But there's nothing worse than an angry guy with a cold in July.  Let me tell you something.  Yeah.  But the yogurt is adding more phlegm.  Yeah.  Have some milk after that.  I did that already this morning.  I had some cereal.  I'll just phlegm everything.  Everything that makes you phlegmy.  Yeah.  And I have to be, you know, tough radio guy.  And I'm calling him Bob and Tob.  Bob and Tob.  You knob.  I can't freaking talk. 
[02:28:30]  I'm the worst.  That fat douchebag at the other station really hates us, huh?  Who?  That fucking roly-poly douche.  Oh, yeah.  And he knows we were talking about him.  And he knows we hate him.  And now he's going to go and laugh rat.  Let him.  He huffed off, what was it, Friday?  His hands on his fat hips.  No, we really let him have it last Friday.  He huffed off, or the Friday before he went away for the long weekend.  Yeah.  And he was going to get us in trouble.  Remember, he grabbed his walkie-talkie and huffed off.  Beat it, Fetso.  Walkie-talkie.  And guess what?  What?  Nothing came of that.  No, nothing came of that.  Because they think he's a joke, too. 
[02:29:00]  Like, you know the security guard that's too overzealous?  Yeah.  For the security guard.  And there's somebody that's got to be in charge.  And he might be the guy that has a little sense.  So that when the security guard comes up to him and says,  There's a problem on floor four.  And the guy goes, Calm down.  Relax.  You're a fucking security guard.  Take your walkie-talkie, retard.  Yeah.  And go fucking downstairs and stand in the breezeway.  Make sure...  All right, I'll give you a job.  Make sure everyone keeps the breezeway clear.  And then he goes, Okay, yes, sir.  Throws a salute.  A fucking security guard building guy salute. 
[02:29:30]  And then goes down and,  You've got to keep the breezeway clear.  Keep the breezeway clear.  That's my job now.  And it's like a retard.  You've got to give him a job.  Well, since 9-11, they all feel important.  Oh, yes.  Like, every building is a fucking target.  You can only hope one of them was standing there.  Like, I like how people thought that that building yesterday.  That brownstone that the doctor blew up,  Like, maybe that was a terrorist.  That falls right in line.  Sure does.  We'll attack the Pentagon,  the World Trade Centers,  and then the townhouse on fucking 60 Seconds. 
[02:30:00]  The townhouse with a home doctor's office in it.  In a hoity-toity neighborhood, yeah.  Exactly.  Now none of them feel safe.  All right.  The dumps for today?  Yeah.  Let's go to the dumps.  Live from the Opie and Anthony Show Studios.  Let's go to the dumps.  Hold on.  Cut.  What?  Why do you give him the good cue?  Yesterday I got the awful cue.  Because I yelled it like,  Here it comes, motherfucker.  And he did the-  No, but I was getting a big point.  And I pointed at him.  I'm like fucking Edward R. Murrow.  I was-  Go to the dumps.  I pointed to him.  I have, like, a cigarette in my hand,  and I pointed at the producer. 
[02:30:30]  No, it was perfect, and it bothered me.  Yeah.  You want to do it?  Well, yesterday I wanted to cue up  the lonesome loser for Jimmy.  Yeah.  And I had the big, like, hit it!  And all of a sudden it was,  Here's the dump report.  Cluster fucks.  But today you get it perfect.  Yeah.  You like him better, don't you?  No.  He's just not phlegmy.  I can understand what he's saying.  It's all right.  And it's not an asshole.  That's why you like him better.  Not on the outside.  I'm quite the asshole on the inside.  Anybody with a pantry is a douchebag.  A pantry is a very useful thing to have. 
[02:31:00]  All right.  And I like that.  What are you stocking up for?  Well, give him the pick.  It's a coming race war, idiot.  Let's go to the dumps!  Live from the Opie and Anthony Joe Studios,  The Daily Dump Report.  Here are your FM radio dumps  for this Tuesday, July 11th.  You're all in cahoots.  How do you like that?  At 6.36 a.m., a caller was heard saying, 
[02:31:30]  You're doing fucking awesome.  Of course, this couldn't be tolerated on FM radio  and was promptly dumped out of by the talented and lovely Albert Dukes.  At 7.10 a.m., and this is a bad one,  fullblownaids.com.  Wow!  A website that may have naked ladies on it  was put out over the airwaves.  This, too, had to be stopped  by the wall that is Al Dukes. 
[02:32:00]  Yeah, that was put out of its misery.  Yeah.  So there you go.  Only two dumps.  One being a website,  one being a caller.  We just know how to work regularly.  And we talked about fists up asses.  We talked about gay guys fucking up the ass.  This was off the air,  just me and Jimmy in the bathroom.  Whispering under the stall door.  Psst.  Psst.  Yeah, we know how to work around the FCC.  Don't worry about it.  Howard.  It's a breeze.  Can't even say Howard. 
[02:32:30]  I thought you were saying,  How are you today?  It was like, fine, we discussed this earlier.  Kathy and Merrick, what's up?  Hey, guys, how you doing?  Good.  Hey there, Kathy.  Hi.  Listen, yesterday morning,  you guys were talking about Keith Richards  and his acting ability.  Right.  And Jimmy was talking about Mick Jagger's  phenomenal acting on his video  for Waiting on a Friend.  Yes.  Last night, I'm watching VH1 Classics,  and that video came on,  and I've never laughed so hard.  You were thinking of Jimmy. 
[02:33:00]  How cheesy.  Number one, how cheesy the video is,  and how scary this was  to think that they were trying  to attempt acting.  Well, he actually,  Mick Jagger was the first consideration  for Clockwork Orange  over Malcolm McDowell.  Really?  Yes.  Oh, really?  Yes.  1971, so back then,  you know, I was...  You could almost see it,  but I'm so glad  they didn't go that way.  Of course not.  For being a bastard  without a duke of an idea  how to comport yourself public-wise,  oh, my brother.  Oh, and a buddy, run!  All right.  Well, that's okay.  That's shouldn't have...  That wasn't me, by the way.  That was a good day, guys. 
[02:33:30]  It says badly raped,  I guess by Master Poe,  because that was supposed  to be a Clockwork Orange clip,  and it was a Master Poe.  That's what he yells  when he climaxes.  It's a hell of a rape call, yeah.  Here's try the wine.  He said I can smell your cunt.  All right.  That's quite a vintage.  The vineyards of tuna.  She's dead.  No!  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. 
[02:34:00]  Anyone want to claim responsibility?  Wow, Than's hand shoots up so quickly.  Wow.  You got to appreciate that.  You got to appreciate someone  taking responsibility around here.  Mark it down.  June 11th, 06th,  someone actually took responsibility  for screwing up  on the O.P. and Anthony show.  Way to go, Than.  You know, Than's everyone's favorite,  so he won't get in trouble.  We're going to make a trophy.  He won't get yelled at.  He won't get in trouble. 
[02:34:30]  Right, guys?  Because it's perfect Than.  He just mumbles something and leaves.  He doesn't even know what happened.  That's even better.  He's not even going to try  to come up with something  a la E-Rock.  E-Rock would have pointed  at a post-it note and went,  Well, what I told you  over there earlier  was something of a...  All-Star game.  All-Star game.  Tuesday.  That's all he does  is he points at a post-it  like,  that's your fucking problem.  Read it right there.  I had an alibi.  Could be blank.  Could just have a scribble on it. 
[02:35:00]  Could have something  that we did a break  a half hour ago on,  but it's right there.  He tries a distraction.  It almost worked yesterday.  Almost worked.  He's brilliant.  All right, listen.  Idiot savant  without that pesky  savant part.  Are old drivers  or are older drivers  a danger?  NBC News.  Of course they are.  We've had a couple of these  in the last few days  barreling into crowds of people,  old drivers,  creating a nuisance.  Yeah, but they're only going  two miles an hour, so... 
[02:35:30]  I don't know what that says  about your agility  if you can't get out of the way  of a fucking pacer.  It's an AMC pacer.  A lot of windows on there.  I think you're right, Bill.  I think it's a God test.  Yeah.  Cars coming at you.  Two miles an hour.  Can you get out of the way?  You deserve to continue to live.  They're shriveling brains.  I mean, aren't people yelling,  oh my God,  for like three minutes  as it slowly creeps towards you?  But it's not always...  Unfortunately,  it's not always that way. 
[02:36:00]  It's usually in reverse  at fucking like 50  because they always...  I was hitting the brake  and it accelerated.  And for some reason,  the car just knows  that old people are in it  and switches the controls  because it never happens  to just fucking anyone else  driving around.  Can I jump back over here?  Oh, where are you?  Over here.  Nico from DC.  Hey.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Hey, Opie, you flimmy douche. 
[02:36:30]  It's July 11th, 06th, not June.  When did you say June?  I said mark it down June 11th.  Someone finally takes responsibility  for being wrong  on the Opie and Anthony show.  Wow.  Are you having a stroke?  I don't know.  But at the top of this piece of paper...  Oh, okay.  I'm coming up with an excuse.  Here, read it for yourself  on the top of this paper.  F-O-N-A dumps Tuesday,  6-11-06.  Good thing I didn't read that. 
[02:37:00]  I read the one down here,  Tuesday, July 11th.  But in huge, bold print,  it does say 6-11-06.  I wasn't thinking.  I'm an adult.  All right, so we got  our older drivers of danger,  NBC News.  Yes.  A couple bad stories  in the last week.  Most students take  this safety class  for older drivers  to get an auto insurance discount.  Veronica Forbes  is the youngest  at age 60.  When I repeat  to someone my age, 
[02:37:30]  it's difficult for me  to say those numbers.  They sound so foreign to me.  She's a youngster  compared to classmate  Berna Linden,  still highly active  at age 81  and still driving.  You bet your sweet  Bippy I'm going to drive.  Bet your sweet  Bippy.  What's a Bippy?  That's like a  Ronan Martin's  Laugh-In reference.  You bet your sweet Bippy.  That should be  the end of the test  right there.  Did you say Bippy?  If you said  you bet your sweet Bippy. 
[02:38:00]  Get lost, you old bag.  I hope the fickle  finger of fate award  goes to her  and she hits a pole.  You know what they should say?  As soon as you say  your Bippy,  a hammer should just  come out  and just the claw end  should be buried  in the back of your head.  You have nothing  left to say.  That's a soft  old head.  A 23 Skidoo tattoo.  A 23 Skidoo.  You know,  I used to work  these pedals  with some pair  of stems.  Did you,  you old bag?  Berna Linden, 
[02:38:30]  still highly active  at age 81  and still driving.  You bet your sweet  Bippy I'm going to drive.  But drivers 70  and older  have the second  highest incidence  of traffic fatalities  of all age groups.  About 25 deaths  for 100,000 populations.  Alright,  hold on.  Let's really  break down that stat.  Fatalities per accident.  Of course.  They hit a fucking,  they hit a rose bush  and they're snapping  that goddamn  graham cracker 
[02:39:00]  hips of theirs.  They have a heart attack  if they go over a curb.  They're gone.  Hit a bug.  You don't hear  many stories  of an old person  getting thrown  from a car  rolling down a ravine  and surviving.  Like an airbag  goes off  and crushes  their little soft heads.  Like the good  old teenagers.  All you see  is blood  and a few gray hairs  on it.  That stat  is like  the second,  I guess the first  is teens of course 
[02:39:30]  because they're  just whizzing around.  What's a Bippy  by the way?  No definition  for Bippy.  It was just  something that  used to be said  on Ronan Martin's  Laugh-In.  But it has to  mean something.  It was like  bet your sweet  fucking ass.  Yeah.  But they couldn't  say it back then.  But Bippy  has to stand  for something.  That's all I'm saying.  No.  100,000 population.  The only riskier  group is teenagers  with more than  30 deaths  for 100,000.  Hot.  The American  Association of  Motor Vehicle  Administrators 
[02:40:00]  representing state  officials who  administer traffic laws  wants a national  standard to measure  the driving  fitness of seniors.  Major.  They should be  based upon  their functional  abilities.  Their abilities  to operate  a motor vehicle.  Wait a minute.  Did they say  30 people  per 100,000?  Yeah.  Teenagers.  And 25.  That's it?  25.  Yeah.  Who gives a fuck?  That is not a problem.  That is not a problem.  That is nothing.  And what is my age group?  Like 17?  That'd be nothing.  So 30 teenagers 
[02:40:30]  per 100,000 drivers  die a year.  Yeah.  Sure we heard that  right?  Yeah.  Is it?  I just want to make  sure because we're  fucking everything up  today.  It was like 30 per  100.  30 per 100,000?  That'd be 30%.  They're never going to  do this by the way.  It's too much work.  That's the only reason  they don't do it.  What is that?  It's obviously  .003%?  Yeah.  It really is  insignificant.  It's a small percent.  If it's your kid,  you know that's  what percentage  of them break  their hip? 
[02:41:00]  Yeah, just slipping  in the pantry.  Sneezing.  Achoo.  Oh, I've fallen.  That old broad.  Yeah, Bippy means  ass, basically.  Yeah.  Ooh, she calls  it a Bippy.  Watch it.  She's a feisty old broad,  still highly active.  What happened?  A bunch of Haitians  broke in and put  their giant cocks  in my Bippy.  Then they stole  my social security check  and knocked  my teeth out.  That's right. 
[02:41:30]  That's my idea  of humor today.  Is that what they did?  That's your sweet Bippy.  That's right.  Is the Bippy  really sweet?  I had to suck one.  One was in my pussy  and one was in my Bippy.  I have to wear diapers  because I can't  control my Bippy anymore.  Shit just falls out of it.  One time a young ruffian  took my purse  and fisted my Bippy. 
[02:42:00]  I have such a burden  on my children.  They have to wipe  my Bippy.  I feel bad for Hank.  He got cancer  of the Bippy.  Of the Bippy.  Well, that's it.  Enough about the Bippy.  My sofa smells  because I forget  to wipe my Bippy.  Oh, God. 
[02:42:30]  Is this true?  Is this true?  Spike in Chicago.  Hey, I want to give  Bill credit for that line  slipped in the pantry  and broke her hip.  That's very funny.  The pantry.  Punching out.  Are you doing your kitchen?  Yeah.  You putting it in a pantry?  No.  It's a New York apartment.  Oh, right.  My kitchen is a pantry.  What are you doing  with the kitchen?  Oh, they just had  the kitchen was literally  like 30 years old.  Had these horrific 
[02:43:00]  everything was awful.  Stove didn't work.  Old 70s.  One of the radar ranges  that they used to give away  on like the newlywed game.  A brand new radar range!  Everything on that show  was brand new.  Super deluxe.  Super deluxe.  Made just for you.  Yeah, radar range.  For a while  there was the range.  It was that thing  that had the overhang  and the four burners  and this big overhang  and it was very 70s looking.  Oh yeah,  and there was all kinds  of spaces where shit should be. 
[02:43:30]  You know when you buy  a car that has no options?  Yeah.  So they just got that  plastic piece  where the radio would be.  Stuff is supposed to be there.  Yeah, like where the dishwasher  was supposed to be.  I had like a basket.  It was awful.  You're almost getting  to be a big boy.  I like that.  I'm actually, yeah.  You're growing up.  I'm dealing, well I mean, yeah.  Did you buy that place  you were in?  Yeah.  Okay.  No, I'm renting it, Jimmy  and I'm just going to renovate it.  I got that kind of fucking cash. 
[02:44:00]  Yeah, let's see.  Jesus Christ.  No, no.  Is it that early?  No, I meant like the place  that you had been  or did you find a new place?  Did I what?  I didn't know if you found  the new place  or if the one you were in  sold it to you.  Tell me what he's talking about.  All right, let's say hi to Ronald.  Bill was living in this journey.  No.  So I said to Bill one day,  I said, Bill, you're going to buy?  He goes, Jim, good job today  on the show.  Yeah, I'm going to buy.  But I didn't know  if he bought the place  that he was in  or if he went to a new place.  Or if he moved  to a brand new place.  Right, right, right.  Right.  If he moved to a new place,  would he move to a place  that needed a new kitchen? 
[02:44:30]  Absolutely.  Excuse me, I'm eating.  A lot of guys  will fucking do that  because they figure  the money you put  into my investment  you can just jack up  the price of the place.  Could you put more omelette  in your mouth, please?  No, I'm just fine.  I don't care about you.  What were you getting to?  Well, I wanted to say  hi to Ron in New York.  What do you say, Ron?  Welcome aboard.  What's up, Ron?  Hey, I like the show, guys.  Hey there, Ron.  A few years ago,  I was watching my kids  and all of a sudden  I hear this sound.  I look out the door,  some old timer in a car  going straight down my street 
[02:45:00]  about 20 miles an hour  and at the end of the street  there's a house.  Boom.  Hits it like a kamikaze pilot  so I run out there  to see if he's all right.  I pull him out of the car  and he was all right  but he's like,  hey, I'm in big trouble.  I'm in big trouble.  He tried to turn his car off  and thought that  it would stop his car.  Tell me what happened.  I didn't like your story.  Yeah, I didn't like your story.  I like the content of it  but the way you told it  was awful.  If his story had  half the momentum 
[02:45:30]  of that car  barreling into the house  I think we would have listened.  Let's go to Jay in Alabama.  He's a horrid storyteller.  That's when people  just start looking at the ground  all uncomfortable  and look out like,  why does he tell stories?  Why does he even try?  This is the first caller  from Alabama  in three months.  Alabama!  Hey, how you doing?  Sorry that the show  got too intelligent  for Alabama.  Oh, jeez.  No, it's not too bad.  Hey, you guys.  I'm a state trooper  in Alabama.  I usually work night shift  so I usually hear the replay. 
[02:46:00]  This is the first time  I've been able to hear  you guys live  and I want to tell you  a quick story.  There's some kind of DUI,  1-800 DUI commercial  you guys run  and it usually comes on  about the time  I have a DUI  in the backseat of my car.  I bet that's very often  down there, right?  Yeah.  You have an XM  in the patrol car?  What?  You have an XM  in the patrol car?  Yeah.  They let you  or you just kind of  sneak it in?  Let's don't tell anybody, okay?  Okay. 
[02:46:30]  That's fine.  Alright, thanks, guys.  Punch it out.  I'm enjoying the show.  Just want to tell you guys  you're doing a great job.  Thank you.  Stay safe out there.  Stay safe, my friend.  Alright, appreciate it.  And remember,  if you pull over  a black caddy  with a fancy gentleman,  you don't ticket him.  I'm caddy Jimmy.  Go ahead, sweetie.  I meant to go to  Caller 4.  But that was okay.  A nice compliment  from an officer  down there in Alabama.  We like the cops.  Boring.  Alright, more audio.  Our older driver's a danger.  Boring.  Boomers who want 
[02:47:00]  a thorough test  of their driving abilities  can go to places  like St. Jude Medical Center  in Fullerton, California.  Here, the tests included  an hour of actual driving  in a dual-control car.  Slow down and check.  I've got an arthritic neck  that limits my ability  to look to the sides  and the rear.  And instructor Paul Cooper  had to slam on the brakes once  when I failed to notice  an oncoming vehicle.  Whoa, you good catch.  They recommended  I get special mirrors 
[02:47:30]  to minimize blind spots.  Oh, great.  You need to accommodate  to the limitations  of your neck mobility.  But you did pretty well.  And lived to tell about it.  Information to help  people like me  and Veronica Forbes  drive safely  now that we've passed  the big 6-0.  George Lewis, NBC News,  Fullerton, California.  It's going to be  still drive with George  any day.  Would you really?  Oh, will you?  Why?  Still drive with George 
[02:48:00]  any day.  How about if it was  Richard Johnson  from the Post?  Would you still drive  with him?  Fucking asshole.  Never get over that one.  How can you?  Please, God,  let him be guilty.  You can't.  We were just waiting.  Please, God,  let him plead guilty.  What happened?  Too much work, though.  They're not going to  make people redo  their driver's license  and work road tests.  Here's a test they give you.  They actually,  if you're a certain age,  they just roll a tire at you  and if you yell,  TIRE!  and still get hit by it, 
[02:48:30]  you can't drive anymore.  Like, if you're an old lady  and you're standing there  with your legs akimbo  and the tire wedges  in your cunt,  it's time to give  your license.  Spin around.  And if you have tread marks  in your bippy,  you don't get a license.  Hey, here's a call back  to yesterday's show.  Elmer,  your finger feels great  in my bippy.  Get your tongue  out of my bippy, Gus.  I've got to make a call. 
[02:49:00]  Gus and Elmer.  Gus and Elmer.  They are just terrific.  Garrison from Virginia Beach.  Don't listen anymore.  I don't want him listening.  What happened?  You know, yesterday  it was making light  of terrorism  and today it's picking  on senior citizens.  I find you funny  90% of the time  but move on.  Nobody is laughing.  He has a good point.  Garrison, call in.  I actually don't disagree  with this guy.  It's Garrison P  from Virginia Beach  and I meant to do this  yesterday  but he slipped away. 
[02:49:30]  Band.  Let him call in.  Band.  Garrison, call in.  I don't disagree.  I ban you.  Old people crashing.  Always funny.  No, I disagree with that.  Always funny.  And I love how Garrison  from Virginia Beach  knows.  Move on.  Nobody is laughing.  He's right.  Really Garrison?  Nobody?  You would make  a great consultant.  That's the speaking  for the group criticism.  And he laughs  90% of the time  and we're making light  of senior citizens.  That's 50% of our show. 
[02:50:00]  You know what that means?  All we talk about  is Robert Reed.  We talk about AIDS.  We talk about crib death.  I mean, we talk about  everything awful  you can talk about.  What?  So the old people  and the terrorism  are no good  but everything else  awful we discuss  is okay.  Yeah, every other awful thing.  And we wish the listeners  laughed 90% of the time.  Yes.  They're not laughing  90% of the time.  His grandfather  probably just drove  a car into a school.  Well, now we take  another old person  driving into something.  That's the story.  Yes.  Rick in Boston,  what's up?  Hey, how you doing?  Hey.  Thanks for calling the show, Rick.  Welcome aboard. 
[02:50:30]  Ah, that brought me  a little bastard.  Yeah, I got a story  about an elderly woman  that clocked my wife  who couldn't even walk.  Okay.  Take your time  getting to it.  You want to get  to this story, dude?  What the fuck  are you doing?  Dude, you call  a radio show.  Oh, he's gone?  Yeah.  Kobe in Kentucky.  What's up, boys?  You're the relief caller.  Help him out.  Let's go.  What's your story?  All right.  I'm driving through town  one day. 
[02:51:00]  I'm going through  an intersection  that's a green light.  Boring.  And the guy in front of me  just slams on his brakes.  I slam into the back  of his old van.  He gets out.  Listen, sound effects  to spice it up.  Boy, it.  He gets out and he says,  I had to stop.  I couldn't tell  what color the light was.  This guy was like  100 years old.  He had glasses  four inches thick.  He couldn't even see  the freaking light.  He stopped at a green light.  Because he couldn't tell  what color the light was.  Because he was afraid  to take his license.  What about the positioning  of it? 
[02:51:30]  It's on the bottom.  He's playing it safe.  Poor old codger.  Boys, have a good one.  All right.  He just wants to have  his dignity back  like he did back  in the late 30s,  early 40s,  where he wasn't just  slapped by people  on the street.  He drove a tank  or something  in a great war.  My grandmother's  going to be 99  in October  and she's still dressed.  That's good.  Why?  Why?  Does she still fuck?  I think when she was  like 75.  Yeah, that would be impressive.  99, that's not impressive.  You know what that's like?  No, it isn't.  That's like handing 
[02:52:00]  a child a loaded gun  and going,  he's had it for four days  and hasn't shot himself yet.  No, it's not.  The kid scenario  is funnier.  Hold on.  That's not true though.  She has over 75 years  of driving experience.  That doesn't  chalk up to experience.  Are you joking?  I don't ride with her.  Jimmy's on to something  here though.  We all have an old relative  that we brag about.  Mine was a great aunt.  She finally passed  at 101  and I used to say  and she lives alone.  She still lives alone  and she goes shopping  at the corner  and you're like, 
[02:52:30]  That was the second half  of my story.  Really?  But we all do it.  She still does vol.  I think it's because  she plays bridge  that keeps her mind  so strong.  But we all do that.  We have that relative.  We brag about it.  Jimmy hit it right  on the head.  Really impress us.  Does she still fuck?  Does she still skydive?  Does she still do real shit?  I'll bet you  she still gives rides  to like,  she's probably a nice lady  and she'll probably  still pick up a hitchhiker  occasionally  and pull over  and suck his cock.  I'm not trying  Jimmy, Jimmy, that's my grandma.  No disrespect. 
[02:53:00]  She's a woman.  More importantly.  Well, how would she  get that done though, Jimmy?  You know, we're just  talking about someone's grandma.  She'd probably be  driving along  and, oh, look at the young man  looks like my grandson.  He probably shouldn't  be walking.  Is that the radio in the car?  It's going to rain.  Jimmy, don't do that to me.  I don't want to picture  my grandmother blowing me.  She pulls over  and the young guy  gets in and she talks  and, my grandson  looks like you.  He tells jokes.  He's on TV. 
[02:53:30]  He's very funny.  Young man,  why are you looking at me  and rubbing your crotch?  What can I do for you?  Let me tickle your bippy.  That's what happens.  Fast forward five minutes later.  Their bony old hand.  The car is pulled over.  The teeth are on  the fucking dashboard.  The old Studebaker  is pulled over.  Teeth from the dashboard.  And the two fingers  are working the balls  and asshole.  And this is the noise  you hear  as the hitchhiker's head  pushes that head  onto the car. 
[02:54:00]  You have to let me up  to breathe.  My sinuses aren't  what they used to be.  Oh, shit.  My grandson's  on television.  Why are you doing this?  That's horrible.  He's right here.  It really isn't.  It's funny and I don't  give a fuck.  I mean, Bill's.  I'm just saying in general  because we're all sick  of hearing how great  your old relative is.  I never said she was great.  I was going to start  thrashing her.  And she still drives.  No, I didn't.  But we all do it.  I never did. 
[02:54:30]  I didn't go,  and she still drives.  I'm going,  she still drives.  She still drives.  We all do it.  You know, I can hear  the day, but her head  is clogged with mucus.  Not only does she fuck,  but she looks back  over the shoulder  and taunts you  if it's not hard enough.  99 years young,  fuck me harder.  She wants a hard cock.  Comes out just covered  with baby powder paste.  Look at this ass.  That's right.  I'm 99 years old.  She can't get wet anymore.  She has to rub her armpit  to get sweat  and rub it on her pussy.  Oh my God. 
[02:55:00]  I mean, I'm just,  I know disrespect.  I'm just kidding.  I just want to make it official.  I'm out.  Oh, that's disgusting.  Rub a little armpit sweat, huh?  Yeah.  You know all the fucking games.  Right.  As the hitchhiker  receives his cock sucking.  Oh, God.  I can't look at Bill.  Why don't we do this break  on CBS?  Yeah.  Just wanted to fly.  Oh, wow.  You all right, Bill?  No, I'm good at  blocking out my emotions.  I know. 
[02:55:30]  Six years from now,  Bill's just going to walk up  and knock my teeth out.  Well, he should.  Hey, Bill.  Froncus.  That's the sound it makes  when Bill's fist hits my teeth.  It's a new sound.  Froncus.  Froncus.  And your head has to come up.  If your head doesn't come up,  you've done it wrong.  Oh, wow.  Wow.  Well, there's a lot of questions  coming in about Billy's grandma.  I just read them.  Is there?  Mike from Vancouver  wants to know 
[02:56:00]  if Billy's grandma  is a size queen.  Bill, I just read them.  Is a what?  A size queen, you know.  What is that?  It means that she prefers  a bigger, girthier cock.  A big, fat one.  Like a small,  like she only gets all two.  Just goes after big ones.  But she like,  a size queen means like  when she sees like a cock,  it's fine.  But if it's a two-fister,  if she can get two hands around it  and get the fucking mushroom  head in her mouth,  she appreciates a bigger cock. 
[02:56:30]  I think they all do.  Scarecrow from Jersey,  can you imagine how the dentures  of an 80-year-old cocksucker  smells when it's roasting  on the dashboard?  Not as bad as the dentures  of one who's 99.  That's almost 20 years  more of cocksucking.  And she still drives.  How about that?  She's still,  you guys, you know,  sucking a dick at 99  is not nearly as impressive  as still driving.  No?  No, it isn't.  Gotta give that a little thought. 
[02:57:00]  All she gotta do  is fall forward.  The armpit line  made me drool on myself.  That's coming in  from Whack Bag.  I'm gonna do the same to her.  Oh my God.  That is hilarious.  No?  All right.  I'm not trying to...  My grandmother is not a whore.  I'm not trying to stay home.  She doesn't pick up hitchhikers.  Well, let's, you know,  Hump X writes,  my 80...  Oh, God,  is it updating fast today.  That's good.  That means people are listening.  My 82-year-old mom  drove just fine  until she plowed 
[02:57:30]  into a parked car  which she swore  moved out in front of her.  See?  She should have just  stayed home  and sucked a cock that day.  Wow.  Hmm.  Does Bill's grandmother  enjoy scat?  Bill from Waterford.  She asked for it  because she thought  it was like when you sing  a shooby-doo-ba-doo-bop,  a doo-bop.  She said,  I want some scat 
[02:58:00]  and then the meter man  shit in her mouth.  Wow.  Do you like scat?  Yeah, I love Louis Armstrong.  Great.  This is gonna be  the color of it.  So he laid her back  and put something  that looked like  Louis Armstrong's leg  on her face.  This is all fun  but we're all gonna have  to be outside  in the bright sunlight.  That's when it gets to us.  Yeah.  This isn't even that bad.  How awful we really are.  It's not that bad.  It's just a very simple.  We got their  urgent communique.  All those Christmas hugs. 
[02:58:30]  No, no.  Just trying to figure out  what to do next.  We should take a break.  That's the comedy premises  in the business.  Old people fucking.  We've latched onto it.  But it's not old people fucking.  It's an old person  being fucked hard  by the young.  It's my grandmother, Jim.  By the young.  Not even fucked  being deep dicked.  That's what a size queen wants.  She wants to be deep dicked.  Well, it gets worse.  Ass wipe.  Hey, guys.  I gotta tell you  about this time  I fucked a lady  that's 69 years old.  I'm a truck driver  and... 
[02:59:00]  Of course you are.  Of course you are.  Exactly.  Wait, how old  were you at the time?  His blow-up doll  is 30.  So, about 30.  About 30?  So, 39 years older.  And she, uh...  We can't fire anybody  because that's  age discrimination.  And so they put her  with me  and I'm laying  in my bunk  and I feel her pull over.  She comes back there  and she starts  laying down with me.  Next thing you know,  she's rubbing my cock  and it's been a while 
[02:59:30]  and so I give in  I let her rub my cock  and I ended up  fucking her.  Oh, God.  I can't believe  I just told you this.  Anyway, see ya.  69 years old.  There you go.  I could see going  with the hand job  and kind of looking  the other way  and thinking about  someone born.  Oh, that gnarly old horse.  No, that awful  charm bracelet noise.  A grandchildren charm.  Sink-a-sink-a-sink-a-sink-a.  I have eight...  It's actually a rosary.  Sink-a-sink-a-sink-a-sink-a.  She's trying to spit  in her hand 
[03:00:00]  like particles of food  are coming out.  Oh, God.  Hurry up.  Just jerk me off.  Used to be relevant.  She spit out  a chunk of denture grip  and it sticks to your cock.  She's wearing  I like Ike panties.  When she sucks your dick  she leans up  and asks you  if you could reach around  and finger her bippy.  She likes that.  The bippy.  Give the old bippy  a fingering. 
[03:00:30]  There is nothing sexy  about fucking the old.  No.  Not at all.  This conversation  is really not hot.  Yeah, good deep fuck.  Good womb buster.  Give her a good womb busting.  Womb busting.  I think it's long gone.  Well, the listeners  are loving it  because we just  crashed the instant feedback.  They all have questions  about Bill's grandma.  They want to know  if she's snowballs.  Oh, that's not right. 
[03:01:00]  They're just vicious.  I can't read them.  I one time  sucked the cum  out of Agnes' pussy  and then kissed her.  Oh, we had a foursome  with Gus and Elmer.  Elmer.  Did he 69,  the 69-year-old?  I'm so glad  none of my relatives  on that side of the family  have an XM.  What are you laughing at?  Jimmy from Wagbag,  her asshole  must look like 
[03:01:30]  a brown scrunchie.  Oh, is that horrible?  Wow.  Oh, God.  All right.  Damn it.  I would have thought  such an innocent comet  could just...  Yeah.  I know.  Hey, she's 99  and she can still drive  and turns into...  Yeah, I was going to make fun  of her because  she drove the car  through the garage  and next thing you know  I'm picturing  what her asshole  looks like.  Yeah.  She'll be celebrating 
[03:02:00]  her 100th birthday  with a pair of  non-white balls  on her face.  Not black,  yet some type  of a brownish hue.  I imagine that  would be much better  than blowing out  a cake  with 100 candles.  Perhaps Ecuadorian.  The Ecuadorian landscaper.  Fucking awful  onion balls.  Go ahead.  Put them in your mouth.  Is she fucking  Carlos Mencia?  I work in the TV industry  on the professional famous.  I know what you're thinking. 
[03:02:30]  Oh, God damn.  You finally gave  a beaner a load.  Let's say hi  to Eric in Colorado  as we try to move on here.  Eric.  Yes, I believe  for anyone interested  that with a wild sticker  Bill's grandmother  will be flashing  at his show  at Comedy Works  in Denver  July 27th, 28th,  and 29th.  For ticket information,  contact www.comedyworks.com  or myspace.com  slash Bill Burr.  Yeah, all his dates  are up on his  MySpace account. 
[03:03:00]  Comedy Connection  this weekend.  That's a biggie for Bill.  Nah, but...  Oh, you're from Boston.  It's the first time  you're headlining.  That's huge for Bill Burr.  I'm taking the weekend  off after this segment.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Not going out.  I don't have to  have that men in black  thing flashed  in front of my eyes.  So you forget.  Yes.  Flash it in front  of your eyes  so next time you see  your grandma  it's not the first thing  that pops in your head.  Yeah.  It's all the awful things  that are being said.  You're not going to look  for body language signals  when she's hugging you?  Does she press  a little too close? 
[03:03:30]  Instead of giving you  the grandmother hug  does she wrap her arms  on your waist  and pull you in?  Jimmy, for the love of God.  Well, Humpbacks  wants to know  would Bill's grandma  consider a DP session?  Jesus.  Well, it's like her motto.  If you're going to have  one in the pussy  you might as well  have one in the asshole  and then she puts  her fingers over her mouth  and goes,  did I say that, Dolores?  Tee hee hee hee.  Oh my God.  Once again,  for the love of God, Jimmy. 
[03:04:00]  Two yellow fingernails  over the mouth.  Tee hee hee hee.  Frank the trucker.  Frank.  Fucking under an afghan.  I had to fuck my landlord  because I couldn't  fight a rip.  I was too much behind.  She's like 89,  90 years old, man.  I had to do it.  Frank's laughing  to her story  but basically  he had to fuck  his landlord  and she was real old.  Wasn't that in Kingpin? 
[03:04:30]  Yeah.  I think he stole that.  All the young guys  like to fuck the old  99 year old  because she's a cheap date.  After you fuck her  you just gotta give her  some alcohol  and tell her  something else.  What are you doing  in there, dear?  Making you a steak  and you hear the can opener  and  and  and  and  and  and  and  and  and  and  and  and  and  and  and  and  and  This will help you  live longer  you old whore  Oh, she doesn't 
[03:05:00]  finger the asshole  she gets hit.  Oh, shit.  This is a new low.  It really is.  Sorry.  Nobody's making eye contact  with me.  No.  No, it's very hard now  to where  we're using you  for really good radio  I gotta be honest.  I feel bad  but I don't mean that.  It's a horrible subject  my friend.  It isn't though.  At the end of the day  it's true.  Let's go to  Dave in Tennessee. 
[03:05:30]  She loves it.  Dave, what's up?  Hey, good morning guys.  Hey, Anthony  it's gonna be a long  walk of shame  with Bill today.  Yeah, Bill.  Walk with Bill.  No, no.  He  this fucker  he won't even come near me  when there's 15 minutes  left in the show  he starts crawling  under the desk.  Our last walk out  whenever that was  was it  not suicide  schizo Bill.  Yeah, schizo Bill.  That was the last walk  you  non-verbally said  fuck this guy.  I said enough.  The second the show's over  you're dead to me. 
[03:06:00]  I can't fucking deal  with the walk  where  where Bill  then  starts commiserating  or trying to commiserate  with me  about how awful  what we talked about was.  No, no, no.  Not what we talked about.  It was only a couple times  I did it.  I did it when  that woman was naked  crawling over mousetraps.  I'm a very normal  fucking person.  Yeah.  That's very normal  to feel that.  What are you trying to say?  Yeah.  You know what I'm trying to say.  We're normal.  You're not though.  We're normal.  No, we're not.  You're not. 
[03:06:30]  You gotta be able to just  like  throw that shit out.  After the show.  That's it.  It's done.  It was a show.  You leave.  I don't want to hear about it.  Yeah, you know,  she was crawling around  in mousetraps.  I don't know.  You feel like your humanity  has just gone down  the shitter and stuff.  All right, Bill.  Yeah, I'm at my car.  Take it easy.  Let's go to...  I just want to ruin  your ride home.  Is that it?  It doesn't work.  It does, though.  It does. 
[03:07:00]  Because you avoid me now.  If it didn't...  I don't avoid...  I really wouldn't avoid you.  There's definitely avoidance.  I'll walk with you today.  You know what I do every day?  Me and you.  Every day.  Holding hands.  Every day I just go,  well, that was fun.  Sandy.  We're going to be holding hands.  Oh, I'm not affected at all.  Well, that was fun.  I only feel bad  if we're not mean enough.  Yeah.  Let's go to Ryan in Chicago.  Howdy, guys.  How you doing?  Welcome aboard.  It's up there, Chicago.  We're trying to take a break here, Ryan.  What do you got?  I would like to ask Jimmy  what it would sound like  if he was going down 
[03:07:30]  on Bill's grandma.  I don't know.  Do you remember, Jimmy?  Yeah.  Probably I would just...  What I would do is  I would slide the...  When did he become  Michael Winslow?  I would slide the pantyhose down.  Yeah.  You know that sound they make  when you, like...  She'd probably lay there  like a child  and I'd pull the pantyhose  and her little legs  as I pulled them  would lift up in the air  like you'd pull a baby's  fucking, like, snowsuit off.  How do you know?  That's what her little legs  would look like  as I pulled them off  with her shoes still on.  I wouldn't even 
[03:08:00]  take her shoes off.  The shoes would flop off  when I'd pull  the fucking stockings off.  Did you suck on her hammer toes?  And I would fucking...  I'd hold her legs back  and I'd fucking...  I'd open the lips.  Easy, Jim.  I know.  No, no, God bless her.  I'd put my 99-year junk  and I'd put...  Still driving, too, by the way.  Of course she is.  This is what started this hotel.  Who do you think  picked me up  and took me to the motel?  And she paid for it.  Fucking...  A thread of a good slap.  Like her paying for the hotel 
[03:08:30]  is going to make the story worse.  Yeah.  I know, right?  After everything  that's been said...  Well, she's an old  Ecuadorian's ball bag  on her face.  But she paid for the hotel.  What a fucking whore.  She's not only fragile  but she's of meager means.  But she'll do anything  for a good deep dicking.  So then I open up  those fucking pussy lips.  It's like theрастocrats  all of a sudden.  And I put my tongue by it  and I go...  That's how I eat it, pussy 
[03:09:00]  Let's say hi to Mike in Miami  But you know what the funny part is, Ope?  She prefers it while she's on her stomach  She likes the little nose tickle in the asshole  While the lips are being slathered  She wants the lips to be slathered  Mike in Miami  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey, Mike  Hey, Jimmy, I'm good for a good little deep-dicking myself  But, hey, listen, there's a radio station down here in Miami, Y100  And they just made a Tippy Tom reference 
[03:09:30]  And they're doing homeless radio  Oh, yeah?  These fucking guys  Who's on Y100?  These fucking guys  Elvis Duran or Elvis and Duran, something like that  Elvis and Duran?  I just have to be flipping through it  And they're doing homeless radio  And the guy made a reference to his buddy, Tippy Tom  Get over there, what?  You're talking in the studio  You're talking in mid-air, Eric  You're talking in mid-air, Eric  Erock knows a lot about the radio biz  It's a Z100 show  They're syndicated to Miami now  Is that why they got the girl from Miami  And fuck Christine and Aggie?  Because they got the girl from Miami? 
[03:10:00]  Wait, Z100 in New York is doing homeless radio?  Does anyone know this for sure?  I don't know  No, it's Y100 in Miami  No, but that's E100 in New York  It's probably the same thing  Oh, okay  Because Elvis Duran is here in New York  Oh, okay  Because the girl is from Miami, Carolina  I haven't  I've been listening to you guys for the past several months  But they made a reference of  Homeless radio and Tippi Tom  What reference did they make?  Yeah, was it nasty?  Were they talking about  The homeless guy they have on  I don't recall his name  But they said, oh, the guy must have a buddy 
[03:10:30]  And his name's Tippi Tom  What?  All right, we'll get to the bottom of that  Thank you, Mike  We appreciate it  All right, guys  Take care  All right  Hey, Jim  What's the name of those two guys down in Houston  I was telling you who trashed me after I left?  Johnson and Walters, I think  Walters and Johnson  What happened?  I was hyping my gigs in the Improv in Houston  And there's these two old guys  You walk in and  Oh, yeah  We talked about that off air  I'm sorry  Yeah  Okay  Do you remember that  This guy basically does all these voices 
[03:11:00]  Yeah  And they sound exactly like  He does like a black guy  So he'll be talking like  You know, he listens to Houston, blah, blah  And then he'll be like  To imitate the black guy  He'll be like  Like just like  Oh, I didn't know that  Like that's literally his impression  That's the impression  And then he does like a girl  It's like, you know  He's fucking horrific  But the thing is  You have to sit there and pretend  That you like it  No  That it's different people  Oh, you gotta pretend that you're  And his listeners  Wait, he tells you  I'm gonna do a lot of different characters  No, the engineer goes in there  And goes, yeah, don't  He does a bunch of different voices 
[03:11:30]  Our listeners don't realize  That there's not a black guy  A woman  A gay guy  A gay guy  Like all the hack fucking impressions  And he does all of them  And he does all of these  And he does all of these  So I'm literally sitting there  It's just guys like  Switching voices  Horrifically  Horrifically  Right in front  And I'm sitting there going  Like this is the worst shit  And it's so awkward  Because you can't address it  And I don't know  I just, you know  I didn't have a good performance  But rather than them just going  Hey, we don't think you're funny  They waited until I left 
[03:12:00]  Oh boy  And then they just started  Trashing me  Going, you know  A lot of times  Comedians come in  They're actually prepared  Which I wasn't  But you know what  How are you supposed to  Give an honest  Here's the  Bill's the type of dude  Like in the studio  You're not going to do  Material in the studio  He fucking hangs out  And he just riffs  And how are you going to riff  When the guy you're supposed  To riff with  Is being so dishonest  Like the first thing  Yeah, I don't know  The first thing I would see  Bill doing  I don't know either  The first thing I would see  Bill doing is going  Hey, why are you doing that?  Why are you changing 
[03:12:30]  Like  And I was literally  That's all I could think  Of saying like  Dude, that is the worst impression  Of a black dude  I ever heard  You're horrific  Yeah  But I'm like  You know, I'm playing the game  And we hate  The numbers are low  I'm like  I gotta sell the show  I'm spinning plates in there  I got those little  Fourth of July sparklers  Going over my head  So I fucking play the game  And then that's the greatest thing  Then I leave  And they trash me  Because I wasn't funny  I did that show  When I was in Houston  They had just come back  On the air in Houston  And I was bombing 
[03:13:00]  So badly on that show  Because again  I won't go into material  That they actually played  A fucking musical comedy CD  While you were  Well they weren't dicks to me  To my knowledge  I don't think they bashed me  No one ever told me  They bashed  I think someone would have said it  I would have found out  But the pests are all knowing  I got  They were just awful  Awful  Older guy  There was no vibe  In the room either  It was an empty studio  How many real people are there?  Two  Two  Actually none  I mean just  There's the two guys  And like the

Do you do the fake black guy  And woman  And gay guy every day?  What the funny  Well what you talking about?  I'm right here  As I found out  The way I found out  One of their listeners 
[03:14:30]  Came up to me  And told me that  And at that point  I you know  I snapped  Like and I just went  Do you realize that  That one guy's doing  All those voices  And he's like  Really?  They don't even know  Oh they don't even know  Well they will now  Oh please  I say that the pests  If you know this show  Should call it  And call them out  Every time they pick up  Every time  And just try to get out  The fact that  He's faking the voices  One guy is doing  All those voices  Well it says  History of the gods  As in G-A-W-D-F 
[03:15:00]  Thank God  Guards  History of the guards  The Walton and Johnson show  Is one of the most  Imitated  And universally imitated  Radio programs  In the nation  Is it  No show has a more  Unique mix of  Stream of consciousness  Yeah it is  Because most shows suck  Opinionated and compelling talk  Guest musical elements  Fictional characters  And famous impersonations  Great skit writing  And production  Coupled with powerful audience  Interaction radio audiences 
[03:15:30]  Seem to appreciate the effort  And yes that was one sentence  Hey you know  It's kind of cool though  Even though  Like this  This is kind of good  Because it's a show  That we're not going to like  Bill is yet again  Rune the bit guy  And I'm happy  For a show that we don't like  But I didn't ruin  I've gone in there twice  And sat there  With like fucking blood  Coming out of my eye  Why couldn't you ruin  The big guy  When you were sitting there  In front of him  Yeah  That's a good point  Because you know what  You guys disguise your bits  So well  I don't really understand

[03:31:00]  No one's seen it  So now a birth certificate  Has been released  But there's some major problems  With this birth certificate  TMZ  Has obtained a copy  Who's TMZ  I don't know  Is that the website  Or whatever it is  Yeah  Copy of the official  Birth certificate  Of the elusive  Surrey Cruise  Daughter of Tom Cruise  And Katie Holmes  I like to call him Tomcat  The document filed  With the Los Angeles  County Register  Recorder  County Clerk  Was filed  May 8th  2006  There are several  Interesting items 
[03:31:30]  Of note  First  St. John's Hospital  Has a policy  Of filing birth certificates  Within 10 days of birth  In this case  Surrey  Was born on April 18th  But the certificate  Was not filed  Until May 8th  20 days later  An official  From the hospital  Told TMZ  That the delay  Occurred because  They needed a signature  From the parents  To representatives  Of the parents  Certifying birth  And that person  Did not come in  Until May 4th  That person  From the parents  The person who signed  Is labeled 
[03:32:00]  Friend  The signature  Is not legible  What the hell's going on  What is that  You don't have  What is going on  It's your first  Child ever  And your name  Isn't even on the  Birth certificate  Your signature  Well because  That would be forgery  Right  Because you're  You're not really  The person that  That had anything  To do with the birth  Also  The attendant  Or certifier  Who signed  The certificate  Ann Heffernan  RNC  Was not in the  Delivery room  And did not see  The baby  But a hospital rep 
[03:32:30]  Tells TMZ  That Heffernan  Is authorized  To sign  When the doctor  Is not available  A hospital rep  Said normally  The doctor signs  But it isn't  A requirement  Finally the hospital  Rep said  The circumstances  That trigger  The eventual  Signing of the birth  Certificate  Where that  Surrey  Needed a passport  And a birth certificate  Is a prerequisite  To obtaining  Didn't Tom Cruise  Handle all of the  Prenatal care  And all that shit  Yeah  The ultrasound  They're Scientologists  Don't they  They gotta give birth  In like a lagoon  Or some shit  Yeah it's gotta be 
[03:33:00]  Some kind of  Silent birth  And then  A spaceship  But the thing is  Couldn't you just  Sign the fucking thing  If you're Tom Cruise  And Katie  It's paperwork  And what doctor  Wouldn't be available  To sign that  It's Tom Cruise  And Katie  You know  Some stupid nurse  To sign it  It's something  You're gonna  Take care of yourself  Yeah the doctor  I'm sure would love  To have signed it  Yeah  Put it on his little wall  He's got something  To talk about  For the rest of his career  I'm the fucking name  That's on there  Right  And then

[03:54:00]  should we play that that's terrible i'm sorry  we're playing it because he plays the ukulele really really good you don't have to play it  today i'll go home and get your shine box what would the difference be if we play it today or  a week well that's not really i mean if there was like a beatles conversation going on what is this  fucking unsigned bands channel that's a good idea ukulele what you're saying is wait for a really  shitty show and then play it yeah i mean what would the difference i i say we play it and if it's bad 
[03:54:30]  now we have to play it it's not going to be bad though it's not bad it's just a really good version  that's how good we are we make things into a thing and then you gotta hear ah see that's how it works  if we just play it without any any buildup who cares here's a ukulele yeah being played real good  you know since we're in central park and you had strawberry  is that you doing the voiceover that song entitled while my guitar gently weeps  this better get good quick real quick it sucks so far 
[03:55:00]  nobody make eye contact with him  maybe he'll just leave exactly i actually had work to do that's terrible i'm sorry 
[03:55:30]  maybe he'll just walk out uncomfortably you're riding around in that  fucking awful hybrid car listening to this getting choked up yes i was dropping a tear pretending you  were playing the ukulele i was actually walking around with his legs crossed  even a little social message first we just have to be good to each other  this song sucks it stinks and i don't like it 
[03:56:00]  give a piece of chance yeah you know really war is not the answer he lapses into this stupid hillbilly  song yeah just give peace a chance this might be the most heinous 30 seconds of radio right here  it's so bad this isn't bad it stinks why do you hate it could listen to it it's awful oh my god  that's such a fucking cliche some closet homosexual playing a ukulele what's my problem you're in my 
[03:56:30]  fucking house wait a minute damn skipping i gotta tear down a wall here you just said that's so cliche  i mean it was supposed to be i know it was that's why i said that  oh here he goes  how'd your parents die  it's actually quite fitting steve just hanging out with the hippies yes  hanging out with the hippies yeah that strawberry feels 
[03:57:00]  standing in with a lit candle so when did you discover the reels man  well i first found them at my lowest time yes as a teenager  it's when i saw only one set of footprints and i realized i wasn't on the beach i was trying my  sister's clothing on in a closet alone by myself  wearing my rings  if you weren't so much bigger than me i would break this cd on your teeth it really is an advantage 
[03:57:30]  the fact that i could kill everyone in the fucking room is really an advantage it makes my  heartbeat not rise above 85 beats per minute it's actually preferred to listen to the rest of this  audio wow yeah you're a humanitarian kill us this guy does this guy does play the ukulele well  does he exactly he does yeah i mean why would you dedicate  this amount of time to learning to play this fucking instrument  that's awful 
[03:58:00]  i guarantee you play this over and over in your car i do pretending that it was you  ukulele i bet he even makes the little hand motions but he puts the hands closer than the  guitar would be because that's the way it is with the air ukulele because it's exactly  he pretends he's an rem fucking put an air gun to your mouth and pull the air trigger  okay that was a good joke i didn't sorry that's actually a mandolin i believe so yeah but it's  close enough  you play the ukulele they always request like tip throw tiptoe through the tulips yeah you never get 
[03:58:30]  you never get a beetle song that's their stairway to heaven no i don't play tiptoe through the tulips  oh it's not over i thought that was a big ending oh no it's awful he's gonna bring it down now so  he can say something about the world that's right you know i just think that there's so much violence  and you have to just stop it it's awful easy social messages imagine if you will there's so much  violence and that's just against women in my promos 
[03:59:00]  imagine there's no heaven this is the sound food makes when it dribbles into his belly well  no shit all right that was uh that was that was that was really good wasn't it  are you little maggot you make me want to vomit that was awful what why let me see it it just was  it's like who cares like i going down to the subway and listen to some fucking guy play a  saxophone version of it and then going up the street and watching a guy play a spacklebugget version  i don't like the way the guy fucking like talked it up first yeah this is a little uh 
[03:59:30]  little ditty little thing i do all right that's right all right well horrible  that's right i thought the show was going pretty good up until that yeah yeah yeah right up until  that point we can now having fun i just derailed it oh well all right we're gonna get out of here  thank you yep yeah now i'm in a really good mood to go to my okay decided when the show was ending  today yeah well it's bedtime the terrorist act with my ukulele weeps 
[04:00:00]  that's actually what it's called is of course it is  all right while our audience vomits ron and jersey this is this is pretty good ron  hey it kind of tied together that you played that george harrison song yeah because that line  by steve about you're in my fucking house isn't that what he said right before he got stabbed  george harrison yeah i forgot about that all right let's say hi to ann in new york get the
