<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts' characteristically crude humor, joking about their show's popularity and the snowy conditions in New York City, followed by a discussion of the city's garbage problem and a morbidly humorous theory about a mass bird death.  The show then heavily focused on Ted Williams, the homeless man with a surprisingly good radio voice, detailing his appearances on national television and making numerous offensive jokes about his appearance and hygiene. They also discussed his past and family, including his ex-wife.  A caller, Al from Brooklyn, complained about snow removal and sanitation worker pay, leading to further vulgar commentary about Mayor Bloomberg's policies.  A lengthy, rambling discussion about ordering Chinese food, replete with offensive stereotypes, ensued.  The hosts excitedly anticipated the social media fallout from a significant on-air mistake made by producer E-Rock ("niggling"). They briefly mentioned the high price of bluefin tuna and their successful NVIDIA stock investment.  The pre-break segment concluded with insensitive jokes about Three Kings Day and Hispanic culture.

The second segment shifted to a discussion of Robert Plant’s apparent distance from Led Zeppelin’s legacy, comparing him to Neil Young and including a humorous anecdote about a Neil Young concert.  The conversation took a sexually explicit turn, focusing on commentary about a photo of Robert Plant's genitalia, before transitioning to a discussion about artists' responsibility to their audience and ticket pricing. A caller, Mikey, offered his perspective on Plant's disconnect.  The segment continued with further analysis of Ted Williams' reunion with his mother, followed by a detailed recounting and replay of a significant on-air technical mishap ("the Nagel"), blaming E-Rock.  The segment concluded with a discussion of the Jersey Shore season premiere, focusing on the cast's conflicts, particularly involving Dina. Ron Perlman was a guest in the studio during this segment.

The next segment featured an interview with physicist Michu Kaku, with Joe DeRosa filling in for Jimmy Norton.  The interview focused on the mass die-offs of birds and fish in Arkansas, with Kaku attributing the bird deaths to disorientation and mass suicide, and the fish deaths to disease. He dismissed the chemtrail conspiracy theory, discussed his book *Physics of the Future*, and predicted future technological advancements.  He addressed the "weather machine" in Abu Dhabi and discussed chaos theory and string theory.  Following the interview, a "Dr. Steve rebuttal" segment ensued, critiquing Kaku's predictions, specifically the idea of intelligent wallpaper, and discussing flying cars. The conversation veered into a discussion of historical figures with syphilis, before returning to Kaku's mention of an infinite universe and the possibility of human counterparts. The segment concluded with promotion of DeRosa’s stand-up shows, discussion of the Shorty Awards, and listener calls about social media.

The following segment focused on conspiracy theories surrounding the bird deaths, featuring Troy Quongo who expressed skepticism of Michio Kaku’s explanation. The conversation devolved into discussions of chemtrails, media credibility, food safety, vaccinations, and the psychological effects of fear.  A humorous segment brainstorming a reality TV show viewing arc (including *Hoarders*, *Intervention*, *Celebrity Rehab*, etc.) followed, along with a mention of a live weather report interruption by a "Hawk"-style woman. The segment concluded with vulgar banter about the hosts' personal lives, including pornography, alcohol consumption, and shopping habits.

The final segment began with a discussion about the absurdity of lines outside stores like Abercrombie & Fitch and Ugg.  The conversation shifted to clothing preferences, with one host describing his style as "Cuban militant," followed by a detailed preview of a television show featuring a man living with approximately 1,500 rats.  The hosts graphically described the scene, expressing disgust and morbid fascination.  Further discussion of various clothing stores (Brooks Brothers, Eddie Bauer, a gay men's boutique, and 511 Tactical Wear) followed, leading to a discussion about carrying weapons.  A caller from Norristown, Pennsylvania, discussed the town's racism, transitioning into a discussion of Philadelphia's crime rate and a serial killer targeting sex workers.  Patton Oswalt's previous appearance and his comments on Detroit were mentioned.  The segment concluded with a discussion of urban exploration in New York City, including old subway tunnels and sewers, referencing "mole people," and ended with promotion of a stand-up comedian and a sexually suggestive remark.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Wake the fuck up.  What the fuck is going on?  We're waking you up.  You ought to love it.  It's a privilege to hear our voices.  This is so cool.  This is fucking hysterically funny.  Oh, this is good radio right here.  Yes.  Fuck yeah.  Fuck yeah!  One minute you're acting like an intelligent guy, the next minute you're acting like a big giant ass.  He's got a try to fire!  Oh my God!  It's fucking brilliant, man.  Really funny shit.  Arousing in perverse and interesting ways.  It's like an audio rape.  Yeah, it's amazing. 
[00:00:30]  This is the best show ever.  The Oprah and Anthony show.  The most popular show in the history of satellite radio.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Good morning.  Good morning.  We're live from New York City.  Fucking snowing again.  Yeah.  This Bloomberg better get his act together. 
[00:01:00]  Those streets better have not a hint of snow on them tomorrow.  Or he's in deep doo-doo.  Driving in, I already saw the plows and sand trucks stationed at various parts of highways and the city and everything.  They ain't fucking around, right?  No, they're out there already just sitting, waiting for snow to pile up to start plowing.  I'm plowing.  This city's a fucking mess.  Yeah.  Disaster.  When you're driving out of the city, do you see the piles of garbage? 
[00:01:30]  This city has big...  It's more, I'm looking at the garbage on the streets.  Yeah, I understand.  But this city has piles of garbage like I've never seen it before.  Yeah.  I mean, everywhere.  And these are the nice neighborhoods of Manhattan.  I can only imagine what's going on uptown.  Because we all know they don't get the same services as us well-to-do white people.  Well, yes.  But even in the well-to-do white neighborhoods, the garbage is piling up.  Is it still there?  Yeah, the garbage?  They were out yesterday, the sanitation trucks, picking up a shitload. 
[00:02:00]  But they can't keep up with it because they're way behind.  And garbage is still coming out of the city.  It's not like everyone stopped making garbage so they could clean this up.  Yeah, I saw one building where they're hauling away bags, but they're not going to get the whole pile because the trucks are only so big.  And you've got the building people bringing out new garbage.  I don't know how they ever catch up.  That's like 24 hours a day.  They've got to fucking be out there cleaning up shit.  The piles are unbelievable. 
[00:02:30]  They're five, six feet high in just regular areas.  Well, it could be covered up by some new snow.  Yeah, three to five inches in the city.  That's what they're saying.  We could do that.  That's easy.  So that three to five is sort of two to six.  Yeah.  You get the different ones from the different channels.  They want to make it a little more dramatic.  They're like, this looks to me like it's just going to be a wash.  I don't know.  Because they said, with the last one, they said that it was going to be a blizzard, like right before it was going to be a blizzard.  Right.  They didn't really hype it. 
[00:03:00]  This one they've been hyping all week.  Right.  And I think it's just going to be a wash.  It's just going to be a little bit of a bust.  I don't think we're going to see shit.  But the sanitation department knows they've got to, like, you know, get this shit cleaned up immediately.  They can't fuck it up.  Yeah.  If they were even fucking around, I don't know.  It seems like something was amiss.  Yeah, someone fucked up.  A few people fucked up.  But also you've got to remember, too, that that blizzard hit, what, pretty much Christmas Day, really late?  Yeah, yeah.  Almost Christmas Day.  People aren't really ready to roll. 
[00:03:30]  Think about your own life and think about your own job.  Most people take those days off.  Yeah.  Sanitation people aren't much different.  Just relax.  They've got a few days coming.  They're like, yeah, I'm going to take the fucking Christmas weekend off right there.  Oh, they want me to come in?  Yeah, I'll be in in a few hours.  I don't know what the fuck is the real story there.  But all I know is the city is still trying to catch up because they had to clean the streets and blow off the garbage.  And now the garbage is piled up.  Garbage. 
[00:04:00]  Lots of garbage.  Garbage.  And now they can't get rid of the garbage because more snow is coming.  Yeah, yeah.  Someone is hinting that they need the National Guard to clean up the garbage.  I saw that.  It's like, I don't think we need the military to come in and waste their time with the garbage.  How about the sanitation department just gets out there and does the job?  Yeah, they'll...  You know, I think enough tax dollars go out there.  I think they're paid well enough to get out there and clean the shit up.  Not if you ask them. 
[00:04:30]  I know.  But it's just like us.  We bitch and complain because we want to make more money.  It's like anything else.  Everybody wants to make more money.  Yeah.  That's a nice blanket statement for everybody.  That was one of the lines in Wall Street 2.  Oh, really?  Yes, one of the guys was asked, he goes, what's your line?  Like, when will you have enough money?  What is your line where you could say, I'm out, whatever, I got enough money?  And he goes, what's your amount?  And the guy goes, more.  More. 
[00:05:00]  That's his line, more.  And I think that's the philosophy of everybody.  No matter how much you make, you always want just a little more.  A little more, a little buffer, a little more security.  Sure.  Yeah.  So we got that.  We got a little snowstorm coming in.  We got Michi Yukaku calling in to talk about the deal.  Well, we need an expert.  I want to know why the birds are dying.  Ah.  I think they're dying because of loud noises.  It is like in Toy Story 3. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah.  He'll talk to us like kids.  Of course he will.  But he's calling the show today.  Maybe he'll give us a real answer.  Oh, good.  About the birds.  But I think it's that, I think this is like anything else.  You know when the sharks attack and it becomes the summer of the shark.  Oh, sure.  And you realize that it's been happening for years anyway.  I think this has just been happening.  But the news finally picked up on it.  Right.  And they're making a giant deal of it.  I think you're right.  I think birds die all the time.  I think they just fall out of the sky. 
[00:06:00]  A big flock.  You know how they all fly together.  One turns one way and they all turn that way.  Right.  I think sometimes a few of them make a wrong turn.  Yeah.  And they bash into each other and hit the ground and it's over.  That's our theory.  The fireworks went off, startled them.  They were flying way too close together to begin with.  They crashed into each other.  They crashed into each other.  It was like a flashbang.  They didn't know what happened.  And then their blunt trauma was hitting the ground.  Yeah.  Because you got some idiots.  They died of blunt trauma.  They hit a wall in the sky. 
[00:06:30]  The blunt trauma part was when they hit the ground.  Yeah, when they plummet and hit the ground, they're going to have blunt trauma.  Dummies.  But, of course, there's always a conspiracy.  Well, we'll see.  That's why we have Troy.  Yeah, we got Troy and we got Michiukaku to calm us all the fuck down.  But you're right.  The media focuses on one thing.  They decide, okay, no, we got to do a lot of bird stories in the next week or two.  Yeah.  You think we're going to be talking about Ted Williams in another day or two?  Nah, we'll talk about him today because, wow. 
[00:07:00]  It'll be over by Monday?  By Monday, done, unless he does something really stupid, which I truly believe he will.  I think the majority of homeless people are crazy people.  They're not just homeless.  They're crazy.  Right.  We like to think it's the people that slip through the cracks and the people that, you know,  oh, the bad economy.  There's a family.  They're homeless.  They're in a shelter.  This, that.  That happens.  But that is such the minority of homeless people.  The majority of homeless people are stark raving lunatics. 
[00:07:30]  There's a reason why they're homeless.  Right.  They can't function in society.  They can't hold a job.  They don't know how to use money.  They don't know how to operate with people and talk to family, friends, acquaintances.  You know what's going to happen?  This motherfucker has been used to pissing himself, eating out of dumpsters, everything else.  But that first big-ass paycheck, this guy's going from nothing to, like, ooh, a paycheck. 
[00:08:00]  He's going to be right back into the bottle.  Right back into whatever the fuck else.  And it's over, Johnny.  Well, when you get discovered like that, you've got to celebrate with a few pops.  Well, you do have to maybe pop some champagne.  Whatever.  Just a few pops.  You go, look, I'll get back on the program, but I need a few drinks now.  Meh.  And why isn't anyone talking about it?  They're talking about his golden voice, right?  Yes, they are.  But they're not talking about his roadkill breath yet.  Oh, imagine the guy that's got to use the mic after him.  You know, we come in here, we're like, Mars, could you spray the Febreze on these mics? 
[00:08:30]  I bet you his voice smells like a possum's asshole, but no one wants to talk about it.  It's a golden voice coming out of his sewer pipe.  You think Matt Lauer was smelling his horrendous fucking homeless breath yesterday when they were doing that feel-good interview?  Oh, no.  You don't think?  No.  Wow.  That's the shit I always wonder about.  This fucking guy hasn't brushed his teeth in two years, probably.  No.  He's got to go in for a cleaning or something. 
[00:09:00]  You want to do a little Ted Williams?  Let's give him his due for as long as he's going to get it, which is, like you said, maybe another day or two.  I think they found his wife, and she's like, oh, this is real good, but he left me and my two kids.  Really?  To go down the, you know, what do they call it, the rabbit hole?  How do they say that?  The fucking rabbit hole for drugs?  Oh, really?  Yeah, it's in one of the papers.  It was the drugs?  I think it's a wife.  I don't know.  I saw the drugs. 
[00:09:30]  I saw kind of like the first sentence or two.  Baby mama, I bet.  Baby mama.  Maybe a little baby mama?  Yeah.  So, all right, here's Ted Williams, the homeless guy with the Golden Radio, announcing for the Today Show yesterday.  Oh, he was.  That's not a bad bit.  He also did it for Jimmy Fallon, I think.  Was he on Fallon?  I DVR Fallon.  I watched Fallon.  I read some tweets, and it said that he was doing the same thing for Fallon.  Oh, I can't wait to watch that.  But there's his, uh, there's, is that his old wife, baby mama? 
[00:10:00]  Wow.  His wife.  Behind, uh, behind Golden Voice Ted Williams, his ex-wife, uh, thanks for the pop-up, you  fucking asshole internet, uh, Patricia Kirtley, the story's real hero.  Why is she the hero of this story?  Because she's a sassy black woman that looked like she's a judge on a TV series.  Well, it says here that she, uh, she raised four daughters alone after Williams split.  And, uh, Problem?  Yeah, that's what black people do.  Isn't that the, isn't that, like, statistically? 
[00:10:30]  She's partially blind.  So then, now they're making Ted Williams look like an asshole.  I left that blind bitch.  Wait, I left that blind bitch.  Right.  Fuck her.  Well, here he is announcing for the Today Show yesterday.  From NBC News, this is Today with Matt Lauer and Meredith Vieira.  Live from Studio 1A in Rockefeller Plaza. 
[00:11:00]  I'm shitting my pants.  Except for the fact that he ordered the names wrong.  I thought Ted Williams did a great job.  That wasn't his fault.  That's the way it was on the script.  You know, a little flat.  Yeah, yeah.  It's time to critique, uh, Golden Voice guy.  He's got a good voice, but his delivery is a little staccato.  Right.  A little flat.  Yeah.  No, uh, uh, George Taylor Morris.  He got no personality.  Right.  He needs some personality. 
[00:11:30]  And then, uh, Ted announces for Fallon last night.  Yeah.  Here it is.  You're watching Late Night with Jimmy Fallon.  Tonight's guests are Jim Carrey, Dr. Oz, and musical guest Iron and Wine.  Back to you, Jimmy.  Hey, everybody.  That is the man with the golden voice, Ted Williams right there, everybody. 
[00:12:00]  Listen to the ovation.  Yeah.  Listen to the ovation.  This bum, this bum is getting.  Everyone that's, uh, applauding like that.  Yeah.  Would one of them take him home?  Nah.  Would one of them take him home?  Dude.  For a nice warm shower and a nice hot meal?  A few days ago, they wouldn't give him a quarter on the street.  Right.  They rolled up their windows and locked them.  Yes.  One idiot was smart enough to go, what's this guy about?  If I had been the guy driving wherever he was standing on the side of the road where 
[00:12:30]  they initially got the video, instead of rolling down the window and videotaping him,  I'd have, like, just rolled up the window and, you know, blurted out something nasty  to myself.  All right.  But, uh, yeah, now he's, you know, woo!  Well, you know what I would have done.  I would have made him feel like he's got something.  Then I would have got out of the car and stomped on his vocal cords.  Yes.  Let him take away what he needs to survive.  Right. 
[00:13:00]  He sounded better on Fallon.  His voice is more suited for, like, a Fallon.  Well, that was the rock music playing, so I guess he got into it a little more.  That's a little stuffy, that Today Show intro music.  Oh, yeah.  Fuck those guys.  He's got to be very bloody, bloody, blah.  Right.  Yeah.  Whatever.  Right.  So he's, uh, he's in the news.  And, wow, what a story.  What a heartwarming story.  He, uh, he found his mommy.  We got that audio.  Oh, Jesus.  This was just...  Did they meet in person or was it a phone call?  I think in person. 
[00:13:30]  Really?  She's, like, 90 years old.  Right.  So she's around to see her son do good for a week?  She said...  This is a do good story for a week.  And then people are going to be bored with him, and they're going to ship him back to Columbus.  And he's going to do local radio for a little while.  And then you're going to find him fucking right back outside that tire and battery store.  How you doing?  Dan's place.  With Angry Dan from the tire and battery shop.  Yeah, I need to talk to Angry Dan today.  That fucking asshole.  Stupid Dan. 
[00:14:00]  Dan from the tire and battery place.  That's who ought to be interviewed.  Yes.  And hear what this guy was like, pissing and shitting outside his fucking business establishment.  Well, the woman he was with at the time was pulling...  Yeah, he was giving blowjobs in cars with fucking...  Numerous men.  In the parking lot.  Or so it looks like.  We don't know for sure.  I would definitely bank on it.  But if a woman is being dropped off by many, many different guys...  In the same parking lot.  Was she hitching a ride to the other side of the parking lot and back? 
[00:14:30]  Dan has decided to take up camp at Dan's...  I mean, Ted Williams has took up camp at Dan's tire and battery store.  Tire and battery store.  For his shenanigans.  He's shitting and...  I'm trying to sell tires and batteries here!  But I still hate fucking Dan.  But if it was my business, I'm sure I would be annoyed too.  Dan's got an employee of the year thing up there.  You know that.  Oh, yeah.  You know Dan is in charge. 
[00:15:00]  Dan's an asshole.  They call him Dan the Man, I bet, at the tire and battery store.  I'm sure they do, man.  Dan the Man.  Not afraid to talk about this Ted Williams, either.  Fuck, is that funny.  We've got the sanitation guys still arguing that it's not their fault.  I don't know whose fault it is.  I don't know.  AJ or AJ?  All right, I'll give him one minute.  Then we've got to get to Ted Williams meeting his mom.  All right.  What's up, brother?  Hey.  Hey, I don't know your name.  Is it AJ or what does it say?  Al?  Al from Brooklyn.  All right, Al. 
[00:15:30]  What's up?  Tell us about your plow.  Al.  Okay, Al.  Take it easy, guys.  No, really.  Take it easy, guys.  Take it easy, guys.  He starts with take it easy, guys.  Take it easy, guys.  All right, go ahead, Al.  Go ahead.  All the mechanics in the day before to put the chains on the plows until it started snowing, man.  They don't want to give the overtime because the city, the deputy man and the other clowns are trying to cut back.  No slowdown.  I'm breaking my ass. 
[00:16:00]  I'm picking up garbage.  We're still getting rid of snow, bro.  All right.  I don't know.  You know, I mean, that's what you're saying.  That's fine.  Sounds good.  You got your side out there today.  So now everyone's got their side out.  We can all agree that we don't like Mayor Bloomberg, right?  Yeah, he's a douche.  And his approval rating is dropping drastically here in New York.  Lumiting.  All right.  All right, Al.  Thank you.  Is it true, too, that the mayor is now trying to get – and I don't give a shit about smoking, smokers, whatever.  Oh, the sidewalk thing?  But, yeah, sidewalks and out in front of bars. 
[00:16:30]  He doesn't want people – you know how people go to bars and then they go outside and congregate in front for the smokes and then go back in the bar?  It's a great social event.  You go on the sidewalk, have a cigarette, and you fucking talk to people you would never talk to in the bar.  But now I guess the mayor is trying to get rid of that because people have to walk through that cloud of smoke to get in and out of the bar, and it defeats the purpose is what he's saying.  I hate smoking.  I'm not a fan of it, but enough already. 
[00:17:00]  Yeah, leave him alone.  I'm happy that I could go home after being in a bar and not smell like smoke.  Absolutely.  But I feel like you should be able to smoke in bars and restaurants.  You know, and then it'll be up to me.  We've done this break.  I don't feel like doing it.  But to get it to the point with the sidewalk, that's just ridiculous.  Well, Great Neck out there on Long Island.  Did just that, right?  Banned smoking in the village of Great Neck.  Outdoor smoking banned.  You can't smoke outside.  And this is absolutely where everybody knew it was going when they first tried to ban cigarettes from anywhere, you know, airplanes and hospitals and places like that where it's legitimate. 
[00:17:30]  You're like, look, I never liked flying on a plane with someone puffing a cigarette.  I remember going to California.  I must have been 12 or something the first time I winged out there.  And people were smoking on the plane.  And it was just, what the?  Yeah, of course.  Of course.  Hospitals?  Yeah.  That's probably a good idea, not to smoke in hospitals.  The worst was indoor sporting events. 
[00:18:00]  Holy shit.  Yeah, yeah, that too.  Do you remember going to Madison Square Garden when we were growing up?  And it had to be a cloud of smoke at the top of the garden or the National Coliseum?  To the other people across the garden or the Coliseum because it was just this haze of smoke.  So it went from that to now you can't even smoke outdoors on a sidewalk.  They want to get rid of smoking in our lifetime.  Yeah, yeah.  And they might just do it.  Through legislation, though, that's tricky. 
[00:18:30]  No, but it's not.  It's the same shit we deal with.  It has nothing to do with legislation.  It's the corporate.  You know what I mean?  It's like we ban it here and there and there's no official legislation that smoking is illegal.  But it gets to a point where you can't smoke anywhere anymore.  So then you go, well, I'm not smoking.  And then they technically ban it.  There's legislation as far as, like, Bloomberg banning it in bars and things like that.  And they make laws where the bar owners are fined if there's smoking going on in there. 
[00:19:00]  But then, yeah, like you said, like, all a business has to do is put signs up out front that say no smoking in this area.  Right.  And you pretty much ban smoking in front of certain buildings.  And to explain it, the regulars know.  But as far as what me and Ant do, it has nothing to do with the FCC anymore.  No, no, no.  The FCC is easy to deal with.  It's the corporate policy stuff banning this and that.  It has nothing to do with the government.  Yeah, you could say fog right here. 
[00:19:30]  That would be fine on regular radio.  Right.  But you can't say certain things that might be, you know, might be nasty to certain groups without getting in trouble.  And, you know, it'll be really quick.  The amount of stuff we're not allowed to do on satellite radio has nothing to do with the government.  No, no.  It has nothing to do.  There's a whole bunch of rules.  Internal company policy.  There's a whole bunch of rules we've got to kind of follow here on satellite radio.  Yeah.  And, you know, we just deal with it, I guess. 
[00:20:00]  Yeah.  But now it's down to smoking on sidewalks.  I'm amazed.  Yeah, because Great Neck, I used to live in Great Neck, and you walk down the sidewalk.  Now you can't even smoke a cigarette walking down the sidewalk.  So fucked up.  And who's going to be the first poor bastard that that thing gets tested out for that doesn't know and just lights up and is walking?  Yeah, but what is it, $100 fine, something like that?  It's probably like a parking ticket.  Hire.  Oh, hire.  What are they talking about?  Violators could face a fine of up to $1,000.  Up to. 
[00:20:30]  So probably half that.  Also prohibited in Village Green Park.  The housing at the...  Wow, that's like municipal parking lots.  You just can't smoke in Great Neck.  See, when you're walking by a guy on the sidewalk here in New York and he's puffing away and he just happens to inhale literally seconds before you're walking by him.  Yeah.  You're like, fuck, you want to strangle the guy?  I know, yeah.  But I also know health-wise, it's really not doing much to me.  I don't like walking through that cloud of smoke outside.  Yeah, I'm not happy about it.  Because it tastes delicious. 
[00:21:00]  Because it reminds me of the wonderfulness.  It's just, I don't know, smoke coming out of the cigarette is a lot better than the smoke that comes out of someone's fucking lungs.  I have a hard time with it because it's like a love-hate thing.  Like, sometimes I'll make that face and I'll go, ugh.  But then, like, as I'm making the face, I go, I really want that in me.  Oh, really?  I want to be the guy.  Yeah, like, I kind of, I want to light one up and just have one because I miss it a little.  I always loved the smell of a cigarette but never got into smoking.  I was never all in.  I was one of those faggoty fucking, you know, bar smokers. 
[00:21:30]  When I had a few drinks, I felt like it needed a cigarette.  Get drinks in, yeah.  And I know I looked like a complete asshole doing it because I never was able to smoke it properly.  What a douchebag.  I would love to go into a fucking time machine and punch myself in the face.  What a fucking asshole I was.  And still am.  I get it.  But not as much.  So, all right, no smoking on sidewalks or outside bars is what the mayor is up to now.  That's good.  That's what he's trying to do.  That's good.  But the roadways still suck a dick. 
[00:22:00]  But you'll worry about people smoking cigarettes outside bars.  Smoking, yeah.  That's when I'll respect a politician again.  When someone comes into this fucking city and goes, you know what?  Holy shit, these roads are a complete disaster.  We got to redo all of them.  Then I'll finally start, you know, respecting a politician again.  That Long Island Expressway has forced me not to live near my family.  That annoys me.  To no end.  But what also annoys me is when they are fixing it. 
[00:22:30]  So, I'm a hypocrite.  No, I understand that.  I hate the traffic when they're fixing it, and I hate the condition of it when they're not.  But they're not fixing it.  They're just patching it up.  I mean, there is major problems with the roads coming in and out of New York.  There's not enough room for these cars.  I'm a parkway guy now.  Yeah.  I'm a northern parkway guy.  Fucking Grand Central.  And the reason I don't take the expressway a lot of the times is because my vehicle, after six months, looked like someone had shot it with a fucking shotgun from the front with all those cocked fuck tractor trailers with the rocks and sand. 
[00:23:00]  Mm-hmm.  And I will always be behind one when some asshole is next to it in the left lane just matching his speed.  So, you're stuck.  So, you're stuck there.  And I get right up on the guy's ass.  Right.  And not the truck, obviously, the guy.  And it's like, could you, could you, do you understand what's going on?  Like, does this idiot understand that I'm being pelted by the same shit he was just being pelted with? 
[00:23:30]  And that's why he moved up to the side of the truck.  Right.  But now I'm stuck there.  How about you move and let everyone else that's being pelted get the fuck through, you cocksucker?  And this might be a little racial, ooh, look out.  But do Asian people have rearview mirrors in their cars?  I submit to you, no.  Because they have no clue what the fuck is going on behind them.  Are they the worst drivers on the road?  The worst.  I go around so many Asian people and look and just go, ah, ah. 
[00:24:00]  Why do you feel when you have to talk to an Asian person that you have to slow down your voice?  Even, like, I think it comes from ordering Chinese food.  Is it?  Oh.  Dude, that's exactly where it comes from.  I'm not even trying to make a joke.  When I see an Asian person that I have to talk to, and this is not in restaurants, I feel like I have to slow down my delivery.  And even if they go, yes, excuse me, why are you talking like that?  I feel like a complete asshole.  Yeah.  And it is because of the Chinese food. 
[00:24:30]  Ordering Chinese food is one of the most, to me, it is amongst the most stressful things in my life.  When you have people over and it's like, all right, you want to order Chinese?  Yeah.  All right, who's going to do it?  You call.  You call.  No, fuck you.  You call.  And then you got to call.  And you get, you know.  Hello, good day.  How are you?  Yeah.  Oh, fuck.  Here we go.  What do I start with?  Do I give them the order?  Do I give them the address?  I don't even know where to begin with this. 
[00:25:00]  What number?  Yeah, 917.  947.  No, 917.  917.  All right, wait.  Address is 35 Elm Street.  35 Elm Street?  No, Elm.  Elm?  Fuck.  Come on.  How are they even in business?  How do they stay in business?  I, um. 
[00:25:30]  All right.  I need beef teriyaki.  Small lunch.  Small.  But you want to make sure they know it's beef teriyaki.  Beef teriyaki, though.  You want the beef teriyaki as they go on?  What's going on?  Okay, what?  No, just beef teriyaki.  Beef teriyaki.  It's a condenser.  It's a condenser.  Give me that.  Do you know one time I called?  I was on my way home and I felt like having some sushi, so I called my sushi place. 
[00:26:00]  And I just wanted some spicy tuna rolls.  No big deal.  And now they have some lunch special where they give you miso soup, too.  And that's fine.  But I don't eat that shit, so I usually just throw it away.  So there's like a lunch special that's like a certain price.  So the next time I call and I say, let me get my rolls or whatever, and I was like, I don't  need this soup.  You don't have to give me soup.  She's like, oh, you don't want lunch special?  I'm like, no, I don't want that soup.  But when you don't get the soup, it costs more money.  Yeah.  So they're giving me less stuff and charging me an extra $2.  So now I just get the soup and throw it away on the way out. 
[00:26:30]  And there's no one you can talk to about it.  No, don't try to do it.  That's more frustrating.  Yeah.  Like, I want without the soup.  Without the soup, it costs extra.  How?  Just charge me the same price.  Throw the soup away.  Yeah.  Don't give me the soup.  Okay, so you want two soups?  No, I didn't want two soups.  You should just order the lunch special and tell them, okay, you see the soup that's sitting  in my lunch special, and I'll just throw that in the garbage.  I mean, I used to be coy.  Like, I used to, like, wait until I was outside, and then I would go in the bag and, like, throw 
[00:27:00]  it away so they wouldn't say, now I just don't care.  Now I'll open it up right at the counter.  I take it out, and on the way out, I'm just like, dunk.  You never see a Chinese restaurant closing down, though.  They know what they're doing.  No, no.  Which is kind of bizarre, because, like you said, it's really hard to order stuff, so.  You know what else I love about Chinese restaurants is this whole thing.  And, uh, yeah, okay, that's my order.  Okay.  Okay, uh, 40 minutes. 
[00:27:30]  All right, thank you.  What the fuck?  How the hell do they do that?  I don't know.  It's the fastest order ever.  I have an Italian place around the corner that I order from that doesn't even come close  to the Chinese place that is three times as far away.  That you can't communicate with.  Yeah.  You can't communicate with them, but they're knocking at your door seconds after you order.  I feel like Chinese food places have, like, mystical powers sometimes.  Oh, absolutely. 
[00:28:00]  Because, I mean, the fast thing is, you know, whatever.  Everybody knows that Chinese food comes fast.  But it's also hot, and it stays hot forever.  Yeah, that's it.  You never get, you never get cold Chinese food.  You get some wonton soup or some shit, and you forget to put it away.  It's in the bag, and three hours later, you're like, oh, fuck, I forgot to put that  soup in the fridge.  And you go and grab it, and it's still, it's still nice and warm.  And you're like, holy shit, I ordered food at fucking four o'clock.  It's fire off, dragon.  Fire off, dragon.  Keep a wall.  Oh, okay.  Fire, dragon.  I'm in.  Fuck yeah.  I'm all in.  Now I want Chinese food.  We got any Chinese food back there. 
[00:28:30]  I'm starving.  We're all out.  I'm starving.  Thanks for adding that, E-Rock.  That was terrific.  You did have to do the black girl line.  Oh, we're going to get to E-Rock doing a live niggling in a second.  Oh, God.  Did you nagle the shit out of the replay yesterday?  I always love when my Twitter explodes with something E-Rock did wrong.  I get so excited.  I was actually jumping up and down in my apartment.  It was great.  I was just jumping up and down.  I'm like, I think we have to go back on the radio now.  I'm going to call Anthony and tell him to drive back into the city. 
[00:29:00]  Oh, you have to.  And then Sam had to chime in on Twitter also.  Oh, yeah.  Because the second Eric nagle something up, Sam is right there to call him out on it.  Yeah, we're going to do the live niggling in a minute.  It was kind of funny, too, because when that was going down yesterday, I thought Sam would be upset that these takes were going out live on the air.  Oh, no.  But no, just the opposite.  He couldn't be happier.  He's happier than a pig in shit.  Fuck yeah.  Happier than a pig in the engineering room. 
[00:29:30]  I want to say pig and nickel.  We'll get into that, certainly, probably after the break because it's going to take a little time.  But Ratspit from PalTalk.  Checking in from Vegas.  CES is going down.  Remember when we used to go to CES?  Ah, the good old days.  It's all about the tablets.  We can talk about that later, too.  The tablets.  Well, if you remember, I jumped on a tech stock.  You did?  A couple of weeks ago.  Making money off it?  I jumped on NVIDIA.  And holy fuck, they came out with announcements.  And whoop-a-dee-doo. 
[00:30:00]  You're doing good?  I was like, wow, I finally picked one.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Let's not get crazy.  We're still way the fuck down.  Well, of course.  Stupid fucking Citadel.  I haven't forgotten.  I know Farid has avoided me because he knows I'm going to punch him in the face when I finally run into him.  I am getting there, though, on my E-Trade account.  Really?  I am getting...  There might be a break-even soon?  There could be a break-even soon.  It's been amazing. 
[00:30:30]  That's a strong year you're having, then.  NVIDIA announced a few things about a chip that they're putting in...  A chip?  They announced a chip that they're putting in some phones for better graphics and shit like that.  And wow, they went.  And then the one you were talking about, holy shit.  What is it up to?  It's now over $10.  Motherfucker.  That fucking thing is...  Guess who didn't buy that stock, and I told you about it.  I know. 
[00:31:00]  You're the one giving me the tip, like, hey, hey, check this out.  I would have made $2 a share.  I didn't buy it either, because I went...  I told you.  No, but I went into NVIDIA, which is fine.  Like, I'm happy with what's been happening with NVIDIA.  A lot of people in the know say that stock goes to $16 or $18.  The Tegra 2 chip is what NVIDIA's got out of.  So we still have a shot, if we get into it.  Oh, yeah.  It's a...  Are you serious?  That fucking dude, that stock, and it was just after you...  Oh, my God. 
[00:31:30]  Yeah, it's at $9.  And someone close to me said, trust me on this one.  And I'm like, you can't...  When someone says, trust me in a stock, that usually means run away.  You brought this up about a month ago, I guess?  Early December.  Yeah, early December.  I can tell you exactly what it was.  It was $8...  Let me look at the chart.  $8.12?  No, a little higher, probably.  Okay.  It was a little higher.  It was probably about $8...  Honestly, it was probably about $8.50 when I told you about it.  $8.50?  All right.  We're at $9.92 now.  Right now?  Yeah. 
[00:32:00]  $9.92.  NVIDIA is up to $19.33.  And I was in there somewhere at like $14.  Fucking A.  And I was good.  Yeah, yeah.  And I took all my British Petroleum money and sold it.  Nice.  And went and put it all into NVIDIA.  Nice.  I was like, ah!  That fucking $9.99, that's not going down now.  Yeah, that's probably going to...  Motherfucker.  I might have to dump a couple bucks into that one. 
[00:32:30]  Well, do it soon.  I know.  Oh, yeah.  You don't want to get in when it goes up.  Rat spit.  And now it doesn't make sense because we've moved on.  But he writes, did you hear about how much the bluefin tuna sold for at auction?  Oh, yeah.  Record-breaking price.  Yeah.  We got to get a boat and start fucking fishing for bluefin.  We got to start bluefin tuna-ing?  Yeah.  They gave how many thousands of dollars for one fucking fish?  What was it?  Like $600,000 or something?  What was the price on that damn thing?  I don't even remember. 
[00:33:00]  It set a record.  It wasn't $200 and something?  It was all over the news.  This bluefin tuna, if you could find one of those fuckers, you're set for life.  The Japanese grab them, right?  Yeah.  Is that pounds?  Yeah.  What is that?  Oh, boy.  Is that a euro or a pound?  I'll convert it.  All right, you're going to convert the pounds into the dollars?  Pay, that is about a half a million dollars.  It is, right?  Yeah.  For one lousy fish.  Holy shit.  That's a few hundred pounds, right? 
[00:33:30]  English and their silly money.  We're doing a little conversion here.  Twice as much as our money.  Yeah, fuck it.  What was it, like, 250?  How many yen?  How many yen?  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  This side sucks a dick.  Hang on.  All right.  We'll go somewhere else.  About $400,000.  I don't know why Mars ran down the hall, because I wanted to wish him a very happy Three Kings  Day.  I hope he had a fine Three Kings Day.  What is that?  Is that a Hispanic holiday? 
[00:34:00]  Uh, yes, it is.  Oh.  I had to let my help go early yesterday.  What?  So she could celebrate Three Kings Day.  Three Kings Day.  Is Mars laughing as he walks down the hall?  How come the health is always Hispanic?  Because they do a great job.  Oh, Mars giving me a thumbs up.  He knows about Three Kings Day.  Where they hide stupid shit in bread.  What?  Are you kidding?  And then you could choke to death, because you don't know there's a little fucking prize  in your bread. 
[00:34:30]  Nah, $392,000.  So just shy of $400,000.  For a fish.  For a fucking fish?  Where do you find this bluefin?  And how do you get, how do you make your money back on that shit?  Sushi?  Yeah, sushi.  How much sushi do you get out of that fucking fish?  I think fish like that, they go to very, very high-end sushi joints.  Yeah?  Yeah.  You ever have bluefin tuna?  No.  I think I've had it a couple times.  It's ridiculous.  Good shit must run pretty steep.  Oh, yeah.  You don't like sushi.  You like the basic shit. 
[00:35:00]  I like the basic shit.  I don't like raw tuna.  When you find a place that has really good tuna, there's nothing better.  Can't get past it.  There's nothing better.  I'll even take seared tuna steak.  That's still rare in the middle, but I need some of that cooked taste.  You want to do that tartare, huh?  No, I can't do it just raw.  Tartare, if it's made right.  Some people really don't know how to make that shit, but some places...  Cannot do it.  A little citrus in there.  I don't even know how I eat.  If you told me three years ago you'd eat a hamburger patty of raw tuna, I'd be like, 
[00:35:30]  get the fuck out of my face.  Where's Mars?  I want to talk about Three Kings Day for a second.  Maybe he's busy digging through some bread for some prizes.  Probably.  That's what I heard.  But then again, she doesn't speak English too well, so that's what I got out of the Three Kings.  Is that the...  We're all encompassing on the show.  We want to learn about other cultures, Mars.  What's this Three Kings Day about?  I know what it is.  I'll explain it.  It's a custom that came from hiding files in cakes.  I believe. 
[00:36:00]  And it's sort of me.  Yeah.  Actually, it's, you know, the Kings came and brought Jesus presents.  Yeah, but they weren't Puerto Rican.  Right, but...  Leave them alone.  Why are you jumping on our shit?  Very fucking religious, very into Jesus.  Jesus, if you will.  That's right.  Jesus, if you will.  But you guys didn't do research, man, because we're not the only ones.  It's Puerto Ricans and Dominicans, Caribbean, Mexicans. 
[00:36:30]  In other words...  In other words...  Germans.  Oh, Germans.  Germans.  England.  One of these people don't go with the others.  England.  England also.  Aren't they the wise men?  England.  The three wise men.  Yes.  Wasn't it that incense or frankincense, myrrh and...  Gold.  Gold.  Yes.  Yeah?  You guys weren't bringing the gold.  They were.  It was in their teeth, though.  Yeah.  They stored the gold in their teeth.  Who are you kidding?  You were cleaning out the stalls after fucking Jesus was born. 
[00:37:00]  Oh, no, the hay, like re-raking the hay.  Yeah, the Ricans had to get rid of the afterbirth.  Who are you kidding?  When Mary and Joseph moved on with their little baby Jesus, then the Puerto Ricans moved in  and cleaned up the place for the next people.  Jesus.  Jesus.  So what's Three Kings about?  You hide shit in bread?  Well, see, that's new to me.  What I've done for my kids is you put grass or hay in a shoebox, and that's for the...  This just sounds like it's 2011.  It's 2011. 
[00:37:30]  Holiday on a shoestring.  Okay, so...  What?  So the kids think that they're feeding the camels that the kings rode in on.  What kid is believing that?  Feed you and the camel you rode in on.  So they have hay and a shoebox.  Hold on.  Where are your camels?  There's 20 of you living in one room.  Where's the camel?  Wow.  Where the fuck is the camel?  Check.  In the Corolla.  Where are you finding a camel on the Upper Upper East Side? 
[00:38:00]  So when they wake up in the morning...  Your kids believe there's a camel.  It's five years old.  I got a three-year-old and a five-year-old.  Where the fuck do they think the camel is?  I'm sorry?  Where do they think the camel is that they have to feed?  Well, you know, of course, the five-year-old questions it.  He's like, how does a camel come up the stairs, Daddy?  You know, shit like that.  Of course.  Right, right.  But it's just, you know...  So you got Santa Claus and then a camel you got to deal with?  Yeah, it's just an extension to fucking have more of a fiesta.  So you have to have...  Ah, more of a fiesta. 
[00:38:30]  Yeah.  You have to have two Christmases.  Yeah, we start from December.  What a pain in the ass that is.  It's kind of fun.  See, I love Christmas.  So it's Christmas, and this was the part, though, after the birth of Jesus, which was,  you know, Christmas.  This is afterwards...  Where everyone else said, okay, enough already.  When everyone came to give him the gifts.  The little drummer boy played his little drum, and the kings came and gave him his gold,  Frankenstein, and whatever the fuck else.  And you celebrate that part of it.  See, we don't have any celebration for any of that. 
[00:39:00]  Once Christmas is done, the kid's born.  We're done.  We're done until the next holiday where he's dead.  New Year's Day comes around, and we get that fucking Christmas tree out of our house  and move on with our lives.  Birth, death.  That's pretty much it.  He's still celebrating baby Jesus.  Okay, so there's the shoebox, and there's the hay.  Where do you get the hay from?  Where do you get hay?  Well, you know, my wife is like a Martha Stewart type, so she's got a whole bunch.  Are you cutting up a little newspaper and making believe it's hay?  No, we had a dry to pay from October.  You know, decorations from October. 
[00:39:30]  Oh, so you find your Halloween decorations, and you kind of rip them apart.  You recycle your Halloween shit for Three Kings Day.  Well, we have leftovers from October.  October's decorations, yeah.  Decorations.  It's a whole thing.  So stereotypical.  I don't know.  I'm not even ready.  All right, go ahead.  So you got the fucking hay.  So they put the hay in for the camels, and they go to sleep.  When they wake up, the hay is gone.  There's a mess.  You leave a trail of camel, like, you know, footprints, shit, whatever. 
[00:40:00]  And the kids have gifts.  Have you ever gone all in and get a little shit on your floor?  No.  Why not?  Pick up some dog shit and throw it around and go, that's camel shit.  That's camel shit.  Then the kids would believe.  They would really believe.  Dirt, like pieces of, you know, grass and stuff like that.  And they get three gifts each.  What a horrible fucking holiday.  And then they watch the George Clooney movie, Three Kings.  Do you?  And then what's left in the shoe box?  A little toy or something?  Yeah.  Like, I gave my two Leapsters, the little Leapsters. 
[00:40:30]  These are little units that teach them how to read and write and all that.  I've heard of Leapsters, yeah.  Those are pretty cool.  It's all about the Leapsters with the kids.  So it's extending Christmas.  Absolutely.  They look forward to that.  Just more drinking and fucking around and not working.  Wow.  Well, okay, we could go places there, but I'm not going to say a word.  No, man.  I'll be nice about it.  The Hispanics know how to work.  I'll give you that.  Oh, yeah, absolutely.  Holy shit.  You know how to work.  When I see that guy with the fucking motorized backpack thing, spraying that, I call him Buck 
[00:41:00]  Rodriguez.  Because it looks like he's got a rocket pack on his back, but he's just getting rid of my  leaves.  It's great.  Hey, you know what I just found out yesterday talking about races?  I didn't know this, I mean.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Strap in.  Let me put my finger on the dump button.  I didn't know that certain people were called Canadians.  What?  Canucks?  No.  Oh, uh, uh, uh, uh.  Like, I come in the bus with a lot of Canadians in the bus.  Uh, uh, we know.  Uh, uh, uh, Newfies? 
[00:41:30]  No, uh, fuck, we know this.  Newfies or Newfoundland.  Yeah, yeah.  Uh, what?  Newfoundland.  What are they called?  Just say it, Morris.  Is it bad?  Oh, what they call black people.  Right.  Oh, I've heard of this.  I've never heard that before.  Yeah.  Canadians call black people.  They call them.  No, no, no.  No.  You know, the race, the, the, you know, people that are describing a bus full of black people  will say there's a bus full of Canadians. 
[00:42:00]  Really?  I'm confused.  That's what I, I just brought that up.  Wait a minute.  Who wears that?  What?  Um.  Oh boy, he's confused.  If you could just see, I wish, I wish this was television.  I wish this was television right now.  Morris looked around like, like someone, someone know what I'm talking about.  He was looking for, he was looking for his fellow Hispanic, but we already filled the  quota, Morris.  We got, we got our one.  There's no two.  I was looking for Travis because I got with Travis yesterday and he says, wait, that's 
[00:42:30]  old news.  You didn't know that shit?  Wait.  So black people are called Canadians?  Yeah.  By, uh, racist groups.  By racist.  But why?  Racist tribes.  Wait, wait.  That was, where?  Like, where are the people that call them Canadians?  Travis, help me.  Come.  He's, he's, he's, he's, he's, he's, he's, he's, he's, he's, he's, he's, he's, he's, he's,  All right, you got to isolate that clip.  Oh yeah.  Travis, help me come.  Uh, here comes our resident expert on all things Canada.  It's, uh, Travis, who of course is married.  I love the casual walk down the hall. 
[00:43:00]  Yeah, he's, you know.  He's taking his time.  Hey, you know what?  If I was him, I would too.  Unless he runs and it's front of his shoe comes off and, uh, hits somebody in the nuts.  Oh, hi, Travis.  Hi, Travis.  Hi, Travis.  So, so, so Canadians are called black people?  What is this?  Oh, that's interesting.  What is the whole thing about black, because Mars is not describing this in any way I can  understand.  It's, it's not something that like, you know, I, I do or anything, but I, I know that like, 
[00:43:30]  just like, I think Patrice was in one saying like a code word for blacks is Mondays.  You know, like, oh, I hate the Mondays.  Because no one likes Mondays.  Uh-huh.  It's like that.  I've heard people, you know, go, ah, fucking Canadians.  Canadians, yeah.  But I, I like Canadians.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't like the Canadians.  Canada's, uh, Canadians.  Canada, Canada's all right.  By me.  So, you know.  There's also a little reasoning behind it, because, uh, when the, uh, when they were  escaped back in the day, you know, they would either go, you know, way up north to Canada. 
[00:44:00]  Canada?  Yeah.  Really?  Where did they go, though?  Mars is trying to make like a history lesson out of this.  Wait, the Underground, the Underground Railroad went to Canada?  No, I didn't say that, but some of the, you know, some of the escapees would go up north.  Way up north.  I'd love to know where they ended up, because, uh, does Canada have any left?  Uh, I don't see many when I go up there, no.  Wow.  No, the Asians have taken over Canada, right over the borders, especially.  A lot of Asians up in Toronto.  There's a lot of Arabs in Toronto, too. 
[00:44:30]  Really?  Yeah.  Really, huh?  There's a lot of Haitians in Montreal.  Like, straight off the boat Haitians.  They're ganging up on the, uh, the border there.  Huh.  All right, Mars, thanks, uh, for filling us in on Three Kings Day.  Mars, Three Kings Day?  And the camel.  Is it over?  Is Three Kings Day over?  Yes, it's finished yesterday.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I would have wished you a happy Three Kings Day.  Are there cards for that or anything?  Thank you.  I'm sorry?  Any cards?  Can you buy a Three Kings Day card?  Yes, I haven't seen a Hallmark card that has Three Kings Day.  The King's on it.  Yeah, there is.  I heard that you hide shit in bread, too. 
[00:45:00]  Maybe that.  That one's new to me.  I just learned that one myself.  I didn't know they did that.  You learned that from me?  I hope it didn't learn from me, because I, I, I, I mean, this woman that told me barely  speaks English.  And it's fucking weird, because they put a baby Jesus.  That's good.  Let's see, uh, so.  What if you forget it's in there, and your little kid chokes to death on baby Jesus?  Here's, here's the whole thing.  So, every year on January 6th, families all across Mexico gather around their tables to  share the Rosca de Rejas.  Rejas.  I don't know.  And now, instead of finding a lima bean in the bread, a little plastic doll representing 
[00:45:30]  Jesus is placed in the bread.  The person who receives a piece of bread with this doll inside has to make the tamales used  used in the Fiesta de la Candelaria on February 2nd.  That's if they're not fucking getting the Heimlich maneuver and watching little plastic baby Jesus  fly across the room with some spittle on him.  Uh, this celebration is the last of the Christmas festivities 40 days after Jesus' birth. 
[00:46:00]  So, Mars, you got something to do on February 2nd.  That's news to me.  Enough already.  Yeah, there's the, you gotta make, who makes the tamales in your family?  Yeah, you're making the tamales.  Who got the baby Jesus?  We ain't fucking Mexican.  Oh, that's right.  Don't fucking call a Puerto Rican or Mexican.  I understand.  Holy shit.  Will you open up a can of fucking.  That would be bad.  Goya beans. 
[00:46:30]  All right, well.  I am, uh, stunned.  How do I go through life this long without knowing about Three Kings Day?  I mean, I love Christmas, but enough already with you guys celebrating the birth of Jesus.  And I'm so up on diversity and all the holidays.  Wait, now we got what?  Dia de la Candelaria.  Dia de la Candelaria, or Candle Mass, is celebrated throughout Mexico on February 2nd.  It is mainly a religious and family celebration. 
[00:47:00]  But in some places, such as...  Tala...  Tala...  Tala...  Tala...  Tala...  Tala...  Tala...  Tala...  Tala...  Tala...  Tala...  Tala...  It is a major fiesta with bullfights and parades.  Bullfights?  The hell year is this?  You don't celebrate...  Celebrate Jesus with a nice fucking goring?  With a goring or a fucking slaying of a big dumb animal with swords and fucking hatchets?  No wonder.  No wonder all you guys are housewives and standing out at Home Depot. 
[00:47:30]  You don't have time to fucking better yourself.  You're too busy celebrating every other day.  Isn't that what they were fucking celebrating at the end of Apocalypse Now?  Right.  As they chopped off that fucking water buffalo's head?  Jesus.  Bullfighting.  Bullfighting?  It's gotta be...  Do you hope to get Gordon the Palm?  Yes.  Ah, yes.  See?  And whoever gets Gordon the Palm and has stigmata gets something for the next Christ holiday.  Two palms and both the feet.  You gotta get Gordon and then you are golden. 
[00:48:00]  And you have to do something at the next big holiday with your scarring.  Yeah, it seems like every holiday is just...  It carries over to something else.  It's like a game show.  Hey, but we'll be back next week with...  Dia de la Calandria.  Now, you can keep your baby Jesus and take that home.  Yes.  Or you can come back to Dia de la Candelaria.  Risk it all for a big bullfight, everybody.  Risk it all in the bullfight.  But don't tell us yet.  We'll tell you tomorrow when we come back to Three Kings Day.  Fuck. 
[00:48:30]  It's gotta be exhausting to be Hispanic.  It really is.  Wow.  There's fiestas and you gotta get the hay for your imaginary camel.  The hay.  You gotta get your tamales prepared just right.  Only if you had the baby Jesus.  Then you move into the fiesta.  Only if you didn't choke on Jesus during the bread-eating ceremony.  Then you gotta make the tamales.  It's Mardi Gras.  Okay.  So you guys are moving into the Mardi Gras thing.  Really?  Yeah.  It's one fucking thing after another until you get to Mardi Gras.  What are they celebrating?  Nagel Tuesday? 
[00:49:00]  Oh.  You know what?  All right.  We're gonna do the Nagel thing after the break.  It's time for a break, Anthony.  And we got Ted Williams meeting his mom.  I can't wait.  All right.  We're gonna do a quick break.  Let me get back.  Eric Nagel fucked up so bad right after the show yesterday.  And we got audio that we'll play next for everybody.  And also the last clip from Ted Williams.  And then hopefully we'll move on from this dumb story.  Yeah.  Ted Williams, the homeless guy with the golden voice, meets his mom yesterday. 
[00:49:30]  And it's very awkward audio.  So stay right there.  I'm trying to swallow here.  Fuck.  Trying to eat a little food.  I know why E-Rock's playing this.  I got this one.  Because it was a mistake.  Probably.  He probably just lucked out.  He meant to play something else.  He probably lucked out.  Robert Plant says Led Zeppelin is a pain in the pisser.  A pain in the pisser.  And he can't relate to it. 
[00:50:00]  Now, I don't know much about this story, but Ant was filling me in before the show.  Yeah.  He's grown past it.  He says listening to it.  He doesn't even relate to it anymore.  He really doesn't.  It's not him.  It's not who he is now.  He's moved on from it.  And yeah, it's a pain in the pisser.  What an asshole.  Well, I got the vibe that he's an asshole when we met him.  Yeah.  And I'm a huge Zeppelin fan.  He's...  What do you mean he can't relate?  A lot of people say Zeppelin's kind of timeless. 
[00:50:30]  Yeah, he...  The thing is, he...  And he also doesn't like people, artists that just live off of their old shit.  He's gone...  He says, I've gone so far somewhere else that I almost can't relate to it.  I mean, in the Zeppelin songs and stuff.  It's a bit of a pain in the pisser, to be honest.  Who cares?  I know people care, but think about it from my angle soon.  Soon, I'm going to need help crossing the street, he says. 
[00:51:00]  He's being honest.  He's saying he's an old guy.  He can't relate to Zeppelin.  And he's moved on.  And he's still making really good music, depending on who you are.  I mean, he found a whole different audience.  Right.  And he's winning Grammys.  It's not my cup of tea.  The thing is...  But he is still doing it.  If you ask any fan...  All right, Robert Plant.  You're going to go see Robert Plant.  What would you like to hear him do?  Of course.  Everyone's going to say Led Zeppelin. 
[00:51:30]  Of course.  So, you know...  Does E-Rock have a quick clip of what he's doing now?  One of his Grammy-winning songs?  No.  He's not going to be able to find that, is he?  He teamed up with...  What's her name?  Some...  What?  Alison Krauss.  Alison Krauss.  That's right.  Alison Krauss.  That's right.  You know, he makes a point sort of in there.  Because when you...  Oh, wait.  Here's what he's up to now.  Woo! 
[00:52:00]  No.  I just thought that would come in.  Went to the fortune teller.  Had my fortune read.  What happened?  I didn't know what to tell her.  I had a dizzy feeling in my head.  Took a look at my palm.  She said,  Son, you feel good at war.  I don't mind it.  I'll be honest.  Don't mind it. 
[00:52:30]  I looked into a crystal ball.  She said you're in love.  How could that be so?  Does it have a hook?  Or is it just this?  I said when the next one arrives.  You'll be looking into her eyes.  Oh, yeah.  Way down inside.  Woman.  You and me.  I don't mind it. 
[00:53:00]  Yeah?  I don't mind it.  I'd rather hear...  It sort of just lays there for me.  I don't like it.  I don't hate it.  For an older guy,  his voice is still happening, though.  Well, not for Zeppelin.  That's probably why he hits a pain in the pisser.  All right, sure.  He knows he can't hit those high notes anymore.  No, I don't want another one, E-Rock.  We made our fucking point.  E-Rock's always game for seconds.  He sure is.  A second helping.  Oh, E-Rock.  In his world, that's all he knows. 
[00:53:30]  I can see you on the little TV, E-Rock.  Hi, E-Rock.  I'm waving to you.  He's on the little TV.  But he does make a point in there,  because when you're really into a band  and you go and see them in concert  and they're trying to throw that new shit at you  and it's a classic rock-type band,  you're like, oh, come on, man.  I just want to hear the hits  that I remember growing up.  Just the hits.  And not many bands could keep that going.  One of the greatest instances of that  wasn't even something I saw.  It's what you saw.  And I remember it every time 
[00:54:00]  I hear stories like this.  Neil Young.  Oh, fuck.  When you went to see Neil Young  and just said,  the guy did not play any fucking thing.  Until like two and a half hours in.  And everybody was like, yeah, finally.  But they were mad by that point.  Well, the guy behind me  could have been the biggest  Neil Young fan ever.  And to hear his excitement go from  level through the fucking roof  to this is fucking bullshit.  This is bullshit, man.  It's still one of the greatest moments 
[00:54:30]  I've ever had at a concert.  Play cinnamon, girl,  you fucking cock.  This guy,  Neil Young can't do any wrong in his eyes.  And by the end of the concert,  he was the dope that stood up and said,  hey, Neil,  what about one for us?  One for us.  Yeah.  And he started,  he had the Neil Young shirt.  He was so fucking excited  to see Neil Young.  It is very self-serving  when a musician does that.  I understand their boredom.  I understand that  they want to open up creatively  and do different things. 
[00:55:00]  But if you're putting out albums also  and writing, that's fine.  The second you take it out live,  you got to give the people  that paid to see you  what the fuck they want.  It's not your time.  It's our time.  Well, when we were growing up,  Jesus fucking,  that's what he can't relate to.  Getting on those tight fucking jeans on anymore.  With no underpants.  Popped up an old Zeppelin picture.  Robert Plant's crotch.  And his cock is like 
[00:55:30]  bent under his ball sack.  I don't know what's going on there.  I think he's all ball bag.  No, his balls are right there.  You can see his cock.  It's over.  Yeah.  And then his balls are down like...  You guys want a better picture?  Oh, boy, do we.  Please.  Find fucking cock bulge pictures.  Jesus.  Oh, yeah, yeah, there it is.  That's what he can't relate to.  That?  Showing his cock?  Right.  Is he wearing the loose sweatpants these days?  Well, we've made this point.  If you're like a Neil Young guy 
[00:56:00]  and you've decided,  fuck my hits,  I want to play my new shit,  then, all right,  how about you drop the ticket price?  Then I will understand.  And let everybody know  that that's what they're going to get  for the evening with Neil Young.  But to go to these concerts,  it's costing you a fortune.  Yeah.  And then you go in there  assuming he's going to sing  all the songs you like  and he doesn't even come close  to singing anything  that you even know,  that's bullshit.  Yeah.  If you want to fucking experiment  and fuck around  and not do any of your old shit.  I can't even talk  in these bullseye pictures. 
[00:56:30]  That one looks tiny, dude.  I don't know what that is.  That looks tiny.  That looks like a pea shooter.  No, it's got like a tumor on his leg.  No, well, it's one ball  and then like a little  like Brett Favre action.  Oh, is that what's going on there?  Sticking out to the side.  I couldn't tell.  You can see that he's unclipped  through his pants.  I see foreskin.  Maybe Plant is making a good point today.  I don't even know how pants  bunch up like that.  I know.  It's like fucking bizarre, man. 
[00:57:00]  But that's what you do.  You drop the ticket price.  So everyone understands  it's going to be a little different.  And then I don't think people  would have much of a problem.  Really fast.  We got Mike in New York  with a Zeppelin coming.  Mikey, go ahead.  Hey, when Robert Plant's grandson  is blasting Zeppelin in his room,  does Robert Plant yell at him,  turn that shit down?  Probably.  That's what it sounds like.  That's what he means  when he says he can't relate to it.  Oh, really?  I think he means like  that would happen.  I bet you he could still relate  to the castle he lives in. 
[00:57:30]  And the money.  Some of the cash.  That's what I'm saying.  If you can't relate,  then give the castle back.  Go live humbly somewhere else.  Yeah.  Enough of Zeppelin.  I'm still all in with Zeppelin.  Yeah, I mean, you know,  he's not going to like  a few Zeppelin tunes.  There's the clips.  Why don't we play it?  Oh.  Homeless bum meets his mom  who's going to die any day now.  Bum meets his mother.  You are a bum.  Is he part engine?  I don't know what he is. 
[00:58:00]  I think he's all in African.  You think he's...  Yeah.  Well, he's got the African.  I think he's all in.  Might be one of those black Indians.  You see him every once in a while.  Out on Long Island.  Oh, yeah.  The reservations out there  on Long Island  where they sell the cheap cigarettes.  Oh, yeah.  They're all black.  And get the tax breaks.  I don't know where  they got the Indian from.  There's not a hint  of Indian blood in them,  but man,  they get their tax breaks out there.  Ain't one Indian in Mastic.  And then every once in a while  they break into your home  and kill your wife.  Yeah, that happens.  Get a few of those stories 
[00:58:30]  every once in a while out there.  That's wonderful.  What a wonderful place to live.  Marvelous.  Jesus.  Ted Williams' announcer  has his own Wikipedia page.  Does he?  Wikipedia page.  Romer has it.  Kraft is now hiring this guy.  Is everyone hiring him?  Oh, what?  Not the Patriots, right?  Oh.  You're talking about  Kraft macaroni and cheese?  Kraft macaroni and cheese.  Yeah.  Wow.  That's another rumor coming in.  They want him to record a spot  that'll run in like 
[00:59:00]  one of the bowl games  this weekend  for college football.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah, everybody wants  to do something like right now.  Everyone wants it  when he's hot.  Who the fuck  is representing him?  Robert Eatman, I hear.  That's why he's not  taking our calls.  Wow.  Bob, do you guys want  to sit and do lunch  with my new client?  Right.  He's wonderful.  I don't think  you should do the  the spot for Kraft.  I think you should  stay really local  and do a spot  for Dan's Tire 
[00:59:30]  and Battery Store.  That's more logical.  Ted, that's Robert Eatman.  Hi.  Oh, God.  The heat's wearing off.  I know it's only  been a few days.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, Jesus.  What are we going to do  to keep the...  I think you're being  dropped by Kraft  Macaroni and Cheese.  You're losing some markets.  You're losing Kraft  Macaroni and Cheese  and that Battery  and Tire guy,  Dave, is really pissed  at you.  Right.  He's really angry.  I can't handle the pressure.  I'm flying out. 
[01:00:00]  I'm flying to Skid Row  to meet with you.  Do you have time  to meet with me?  Or we'd be shitting  in a vestibule.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  I stopped.  Ted, this is really bad.  I don't know what to tell you  about the contract negotiations.  They're not going good  with the Cavaliers.  I'm going to turn  into a bad now  and fly to see you. 
[01:00:30]  Let me...  When I come to your...  your cardboard boss,  you have to invite me in.  I can't...  The rules say  I can't just walk in.  I have to be invited.  Get it?  Because I'm not  for onto.  Stupid Bob.  Where the fuck  is he been?  He's probably  trying to get this guy  so bad.  Yeah, whatever.  I want to get him  as a client. 
[01:01:00]  Well, here's  Ted Williams,  the bum,  meeting his mom.  Hi, mommy.  Hi, mommy.  Hi, mommy.  I can't listen to this.  I can't listen to this.  Ah, what the fuck is that?  I can't listen to this.  The wheels are falling off.  Hi, mommy.  This shows...  The wheels are falling off.  It goes to show you  what I was saying.  This guy is crazy.  He's crazy.  Nobody talks like this  to their mommy  unless you're six years old 
[01:01:30]  or you're crazy.  And if he's so fucking  happy to see her,  why didn't he pop in on her  when he was a...  A bum.  A bum.  Hi, mommy.  Hi, mommy.  Hi, mommy.  Hi, mommy.  Get this in my  instant replay.  Get this in my  instant replay.  Write it down, Eric.  Hi, mommy.  Hi, mommy.  All right, let's get  through this clip.  Hi, mommy.  Hi, mommy.  Hi, mommy.  Hi, mommy. 
[01:02:00]  Hi, mommy.  What happened to his  golden voice?  No kidding.  Hi, mommy.  Hi, mommy.  Hi, mommy.  Hi, mommy.  Hi, mommy.  Hi, mommy.  Hi, mommy.  Hi, mommy.  That's what that was.  For us, it would be  Hi, mommy.  Oh, for him.  That's what that was.  Hi, mommy.  I've never liked  and hated a video  within an hour.  In all my life.  This guy's got  a very, very short  half-life.  I just looked up  and they were playing  the original video again.  Yeah. 
[01:02:30]  And now,  I'm sure the news  is talking about  a heartwarming  and emotional moment.  It was.  Who's that?  I don't know.  This guy,  he golfs really fast.  Who gives a fuck?  It's a really fast  golfer guy  and his hair  looks like  white Brillo.  He's got the  it looks like Danny  when he was doing  when he was doing  Doc Brown.  For Halloween.  He looks like  a Bichon Frise.  A Bichon Frise.  Whatever.  Bichon Frise.  I think that's 
[01:03:00]  Sammy Hagar.  That's what he's up to.  Sammy Hagar,  white hair,  but it's white.  Wow.  Like Sammy had  like sort of  blondish hair.  It does look like  a Bichon.  Bichon.  Hi, mommy.  Hi, mommy.  Hi.  Hi, mommy.  Hi, mommy.  Hi, mommy.  I would love  for her to go  who the fuck  are you?  Yeah.  What the hell  are you talking  about,  motherfucker?  I don't know you.  You ain't coming  around to see me.  Where my money,  bitch?  Hi, mommy.  Hi, mommy. 
[01:03:30]  That was me  when I got lost  at Macy's  and finally found  my mother.  And I was  five, six years old.  I got lost.  I finally like  found mommy  and I was like,  hi, mommy.  Hi, mommy.  Hi, mommy.  What the fuck  is he doing?  Hi, mommy.  Hi, mommy.  Hi, mommy.  Hi, mommy.  Do you still  call your mom mommy?  If I'm making a joke.  Yeah.  Like when older  people call their moms 
[01:04:00]  mommy, it's so awkward.  I make a joke.  Like if my mother  says something to me  like, ah,  shut the fuck up.  Or I'll go scratch  your ass.  I'll be like,  oh, mommy.  Like, cause it's,  you know,  it's in context  of her, you know,  mouthing off.  Right.  Hi, mommy.  Hi, mommy.  Hi, mommy.  Hi, mommy.  Hi, mommy.  I know I feel  the same way, mommy.  I love you, mommy.  I love you.  I want to see you.  I'll go home  and get your fucking 
[01:04:30]  shine box.  She's like everybody.  Hi, mommy.  I'm home.  I told you I was  coming this year.  Hi, I don't look  the best, but I'm home.  I've got a haircut.  I don't look the best.  I love you, mommy.  I love you too, sir.  That's my mom.  Please don't  disappoint me.  I'm not, mom.  Don't disappoint me.  The first thing she says.  Oh, my God, this happened  for me.  You always told me  to pray.  To pray.  And I've been praying, mommy.  You know what's going on?  I love you, sweetheart.  I love you, mother.  Oh, help me. 
[01:05:00]  Help me.  Help me.  Oh, mommy.  I'm the funniest guy.  Hi, mommy.  Hi, mommy.  And she goes,  the first thing she says,  and this is so telling.  The first thing she says is,  don't disappoint me.  Like, she knows  this motherfucker  is falling off this pedestal.  Right.  He's going to fucking  drunken stagger  off this pedestal  everybody's putting him on. 
[01:05:30]  Nothing but disappointment.  Of course.  He's been disappointed  in her 90 years.  Or whatever.  How old he is, I guess.  I'm trying to stay strong  and keep it as a nice story,  but the wheels are starting  to fall off on this one.  This nice story  is going to unravel  into him clocking someone  in the head  with a cinder block  for no reason  down fucking Fifth Avenue.  On his way  to the Letterman Studios  or something.  He's just going to  pick up a cobblestone  and wail someone  over the head with it.  The wheels are coming off. 
[01:06:00]  Oh, yeah.  They're a little wobbly.  A little wobbly.  We're seeing a little bit  of a fucking wobble.  He's throwing a hubcap.  Where's Sambo?  Sam.  That's racist.  It really is.  Where's Sam?  Because I want to get  into this...  Oh, look at Sam runs.  This nageling that happened.  There was a fucking epic nagel  that happened yesterday.  Epic nagel.  When the Twitters started coming in,  I could not get enough. 
[01:06:30]  And then when I saw yours,  the joy that was Sam's little Twitter  about the nageling  that happened yesterday.  Because the thing is,  of what happened yesterday,  I did kind of sound like an asshole,  but it was worth...  It was worth it happening.  It was so worth it  because I realized...  Yes, the nagelfication  of the replay that happened.  What led up to this  that we're going to hear?  Well, basically,  what happened was  we were playing 
[01:07:00]  worst of in the 10 o'clock hour yesterday.  No, I mean,  just what food product  fell on a button?  Oh.  We were playing, you know,  the worst of in the 10 o'clock hour yesterday.  Yeah.  And we had the studio free until 11  because Ron and Fez  weren't going to be here until 11.  But I thought we're supposed to go to 11.  Right.  We go to 11.  Yeah.  For some reason,  there's just an hour of nothingness  between you and Ron and Fez.  What's that about?  Maybe we should do something about that.  Dead air.  Yeah, I guess.  I don't know if it's been brought up.  So from 10 to 11,  we do best of?  I didn't know that. 
[01:07:30]  Yeah.  Oh, that's cool.  I just thought Ron and Fez started at 10.  No, no.  That's why you don't see them.  I know you get out of here kind of quick.  You know,  I was in bed asleep  before Ron and Fez came on.  You're probably in bed.  That's pretty amazing  because you got a nice ride  after the show.  Oh, boy.  Quickly,  I had to stop  at one of the stores  on the way home.  And it's right by my house.  It's gotten that bad?  Alcohol?  Yeah, yeah.  I had to pick up a bottle  for the rest of the drive home.  For the 10-minute ride home.  Jesus. 
[01:08:00]  The last five minutes  of the drive home.  I had to stop off.  And a guy is in front of the store.  It was windowed down.  He goes,  Anthony, what's up?  And I was like,  hey, how you doing?  What store and why?  Oh, no,  it was just pharmacy.  Whatever the fuck it was.  Uh-oh.  I had to pick up my Viagra.  No.  Actually,  I have to pick up my Propecia.  Your Propecia?  Well, yeah.  I take my hair medicine.  I got to take my hair medicine.  Because it's all nice and everything. 
[01:08:30]  I don't want to fall back out.  The hair looked good.  Yeah,  it's fucking,  it's there.  I like it.  You got to protect your investment.  Yes,  I'm protecting my investment.  My part's getting wider.  Is your part getting wider?  Oh, fuck it is.  It's getting a little wide.  You should go to,  It's getting a little fucking wide, man.  It's the style.  You should go to,  And then I blame it on the headphones every day.  No, you know,  the headphones push the hair down.  That's what's really going on.  Have one of those.  More so than they used to.  Oh, boy,  is that part getting wide.  You should go in,  have them fucking get the harvest area  and pop that shit right up top.  Thinking about it. 
[01:09:00]  Word about it.  Get on the Propecia.  If I continue to lose my hair  the way it's going,  I'm going to look like  ridiculous bald guy.  You will look like Ron Howard.  That's going to be my curse.  Because it's not,  it's like,  just make a triangle.  Like a triangle.  And then put it on my head.  Oh, shit.  It'll be triangle guy?  Yeah, it's not even going to be like,  like some guys when they fucking  start losing their hair,  it's in a natural,  it doesn't look that bad.  Just recedes from the sides.  And then it's ridiculously  way too much hair 
[01:09:30]  a mere half inch away.  Half inch away!  So you're going like  feast and famine.  Yes!  Like within an inch?  Within a fucking inch!  Oh, man.  Like, I have way too much hair  everywhere else.  I'm not,  but there's,  ugh.  Ugh.  And it's not even like  going to go all the way back.  It's just going to be like  this weird little triangle  in front.  Like Phil Collins?  And then it's going to be  overly thick everywhere else. 
[01:10:00]  What the fuck  do you do with that?  You get,  you get the harvest area,  you have them pop it in,  you get some Propecia.  And the Propecia  will keep your prostate  small.  Yeah.  You could just buzz it  like Matt Lauer did.  Yeah, that worked for him,  didn't it?  Yeah.  Did he grow it back?  No, he just kept it  kind of buzzed.  He keeps it tight,  but I think there's  something else going on  there, too.  I think he might have  fucking did a little  harvesting himself.  Really?  Oh, really?  And then decided  to keep it short afterwards,  yeah.  Oh.  That's my guess on that one. 
[01:10:30]  A little harvesting.  Anyway, on the way home.  Yeah, yeah.  So this guy just hangs out,  he's a fan of the show,  he goes,  hey, what's up?  And he realized  it was 10.30.  That's the magic hour.  It was 10.30  and I was home.  I was pretty much home.  I was right near my house.  He's like,  were you live today?  Oh, really?  Yes.  I did 90 the whole way home  because I must nap.  And then I got home, 
[01:11:00]  I went to sleep,  I was in bed and asleep  before 11 a.m.  Wow.  A.m., 11 a.m.,  I was asleep,  I slept until 7 p.m.  Wow.  I slept from 11 in the morning  till 7 p.m.  God bless you.  And then I woke up,  well, I woke up,  I did a few things,  I may have gone into the basement  and turned on a few pieces  of equipment.  I thought I saw a tweet.  Did you see a tweet?  Well, I was testing the equipment. 
[01:11:30]  Oh.  And if you don't push the buttons  every so often,  you forget how everything works.  It's like a car,  you gotta start it.  You gotta start it every so often.  So I might have,  you know, done that.  And then 2 in the morning,  I was like,  I'll take a couple hours.  And that's what I did.  What else are you doing?  That's my day.  Well, it's too bad  that you weren't in the car  like five minutes later  because right around 10.35.  That's what I missed.  That's when my Twitter exploded.  The live negative.  And this is,  I got a lot of comments.  People Were Experiencing  Their First Nagel.  Oh! 
[01:12:00]  Oh, really?  Yeah.  That is,  wow, what a thrill.  He hates that I'm using that word.  Oh, yeah.  He doesn't like it.  So obviously you guys,  just to move forward quicker here,  you guys voiced the worst of?  Right, so we do the worst.  Or the best of the week,  whatever the fuck you guys call it.  The worst of the week countdown.  It's voiced on,  we start voicing it on Thursday.  A lot of people,  the illusion was burst for them  because they thought it was live  and we just do it over and over again.  But no.  Of course.  So you're taping the ins and outs  of the best bits of the week.  Right.  And so.  And you decided to do it  for everybody else over. 
[01:12:30]  Over what was playing.  A fine comedy bit  that we were playing.  We had this studio open  and so Eric said,  you know,  we have the other studio booked  for 1130.  Let's do it early  and let's do it in the main studio.  And I said, okay.  And then Eric set the board in there  however he set it.  And then he came in here  and he set up this board  however he set it.  And I just took a mic  and we started going  and we got through about two intros  before D-Boy came in.  And he came in  and he waited until we were done recording. 
[01:13:00]  Until we were done.  D-Boy, he's notorious.  So worth it.  He didn't interrupt us.  Yeah.  But then he said,  you guys,  you know you're live on the air  bleeding through the worst of, right?  That's how people get fired too,  by the way.  Oh yeah.  If you guys say something  or if something would have been said.  And we were like,  no way.  And then I looked at the phones,  completely lit up.  Lit up, yeah.  And you knew.  And that was the quote.  You knew something had been nagled.  But so we immediately, 
[01:13:30]  Travis, Danny, myself, and D-Boy  went to the back  to have a mini party.  A listening party.  A little listening party?  To go back and listen to the tape.  Well, we got that.  We got the audio.  Is this,  did he cut it up  or is this just how it went?  This is the straight.  It was two and a half minutes.  You could, you know,  pause it where you see fit.  Okay, this is  Just have fun with it.  This is exactly  what you heard yesterday  at around 10.30  if you were listening  to this channel.  Yes, yes.  It sounded like 
[01:14:00]  a complete clusterfuck.  You were doing a bit  about Dr. Ruth.  Oh, Jesus.  How old is that bit?  Old school.  I don't know.  She's been dead for 10 years.  Oh.  Who's fucking that?  She seems to know  everything about sex,  but she's always been  just an old bag.  An old Betty.  This is the largest study  of its kind.  And while it concludes  having a G-spot is subjective,  more than 50%  of the women's surveyed  insisted they had one.  No, no.  We've got to put your diet in here.  We can't have Troy  getting shit on,  not you getting shit on. 
[01:14:30]  They think they're not normal  because they have tried  for four months  to find that G-spot  and can't find it.  Stop worrying about it.  Have good sex.  Have the best relationship  you can.  Unless you are a Jew.  Like an accent, though.  The J-spot.  Sam, like we do  at the beginning of every year,  we have to check out  Dick Clark's 
[01:15:00]  New Year's Rocking Eve.  Well, 2011,  came in with a bang.  Jesus.  My favorite part...  After all these years,  we're still just a bunch  of fucking rookies.  Oh, no.  We're back live, obviously.  Yes.  My favorite part  of the whole thing  is the beginning  of the recording  because you can hear  me arguing  that E-Rock gave me  the list of what he thought  should be on the countdown.  Yeah.  And he had left on  all three parts  of Troy getting shit on  for the conspiracy thing,  but he didn't put on 
[01:15:30]  the part where he got shit on  for his diet.  Oh.  And so that's what  I was arguing with him about.  He said it was too short.  But...  Too short?  And it was live on the air.  What do you mean?  His beating was too short.  That's what he said.  We could do short bits.  Of course we can.  Or we could do a longer one  to fit it in...  Or we can next time  just beat him up longer.  Right.  All right.  We'll just have to beat you up  longer to make sure  it makes the best of the way.  But this private conversation  about programming  for the...  Right, yeah.  Live on the air.  Live on the air.  Live on the air.  For everyone to hear.  All right, back to the tape. 
[01:16:00]  So they didn't know  the mics were going out  to everybody.  Yeah.  As we were trying  to play a best of bit  from 10.30 to 11  before Ron and Fez.  2011 came in with a bang.  I think they do.  Well, 2011 came in with a bang  like it always does.  Dick Clark was again  put on TV.  I don't know why  they keep on doing it.  And that was something  that was brought up  on the show.  We highlighted some  of Dick Clark's audio  from this year,  compared it to years past, 
[01:16:30]  and listened as we have grown  with Dick Clark  and his stroke talk.  Yeah, hold your nose.  It's Dick Clark  and rocking New Year's Eve  for 2011.  Sam, when we get back,  Dick Clark.  Has he gotten better  or worse since his stroke?  That is for us to know  and for you to find out  if you don't already know.  Stay tuned.  You know,  I'm sure a chick isn't like,  wow,  every set of balls  is like a rose.  I like what pops in  after you guys talking 
[01:17:00]  because you are  so overpowering  the R audio.  Yeah,  why listen to us  when you can listen  to Sam and E-Rock?  And then it cuts off  and you're like  a ball smelling like roses.  Especially me retaking it.  Yeah, yeah.  Stop and restart.  That's what I mean.  I sound like an asshole  because this is  the raw stuff before.  Sound?  Sound.  But it was so worth it  when I realized that,  I mean,  I was in the clear on this one.  I was across the room  from any boards.  You were just doing your job.  Just in front of a mic.  You didn't set up the board. 
[01:17:30]  I was simply a performer.  E-Rock decided  the whole world  needs to hear this.  Not Sam.  E-Rock wanted to share it  with everybody.  Oh, look at his dejected look.  Let's go back to the,  let's go back to the audio  from yesterday.  This is like a rose.  You're down there  and you're like,  I'm supposed to enjoy this?  Sam, we have actor  Ron Perlman in studio.  This was a really good interview.  Ron Perlman came in.  He's been in the business  for a very long time.  He was older  than any of us thought he was.  And the thing about it is  a lot of times 
[01:18:00]  actors come in  and they're very Hollywood.  They don't want to answer  a lot of questions.  They don't want to piss off  the wrong people.  They want everybody  to like them.  Not Ron Perlman.  Ron Perlman was one  of the more honest actors  that we've had  from talking about  the franchises he's been in  to the island of Dr. Moreau  and a whole lot more.  I like how he says  that he killed off  a lot of franchises.  Round number two  or something like that.  Well, he did.  Ron Perlman.  He's been going all night.  You have him move the covers  around a little bit  and just go,  whoa! 
[01:18:30]  Yeah.  Whoa!  You know your little breeze  that comes up?  Yeah, you waft it.  You waft and just go,  no, the phones are lighting up.  There's been some sex  going on.  I love the text.  In a weird way,  it makes sense.  I know.  We almost have to do this  from time to time.  It just stops  and it's so fucking weird.  Some non-sequitur  fucking line comes out.  Right.  And then what?  You guys noticed  the phones were lit up  so you knew  there had to be a problem?  Yeah, E-Rock  immediately turned off.  I think he turned off 
[01:19:00]  his mic before he turned  off my mic  because you can't hear him  but then, yeah,  he immediately turned off  the mic.  I went, oh, fuck.  And then I ran into  the phone screening room  just to say,  oh, please let this happen.  And I started picking up  every call.  Oh, hey, what's up?  Oh, hey, what's up?  And they were all going,  yeah, tell those fucking  assholes that are on the air.  What are you fucking  idiots doing over there?  Great.  Oh, Eric, comment.  Eric, comment.  What's the comment?  Anything in your defense?  What happened?  Paging fatso. 
[01:19:30]  Oh, jeez.  Ouch.  Really?  What happened  that it was going out  over the air  that normally  wouldn't have happened?  Well, obviously,  yes, this was my fault.  What I couldn't figure out  is what was turned on  that allowed it  to go over the air.  There's a button in there  that if it's left on,  it leaves this room live.  Eric is insisting  that that button  wasn't pushed  but everybody else  on staff thinks  that Eric's lying.  Oh, really?  They've all told me  that they think Eric's lying.  He was trying  to get you fired.  It would have had 
[01:20:00]  to have been pushed.  I think E-Rock  was trying to get Sam fired.  I think E-Rock  knows that Sam  likes to talk some shit  and was hoping  you were going to do it.  Oh, boy.  He was trying to knock you  out of this organization  there, Sam.  That's fucked up.  What's up, D-Boy?  He's not going to knock me out.  The only way it happened  was he left the pot on.  It had to be, right?  That's the only way  it would have ever happened.  E-Rock fucked up.  He fucked up.  Travis is nodding, too.  Everyone is saying  you fucked up.  I'm denying that.  Yeah, you are.  Yeah, you are.  You came in yesterday  and were scratching your head  like, I don't know  how this could have happened.  Everything was off.  Yeah, obviously  it was my fault 
[01:20:30]  when it went on.  All I saw was  the tap pot  that's on the left  over there  was on.  That shouldn't have been on.  No, it's the one in there.  This was just  running worst of.  That controls everything.  Yeah, that's the main board.  That controls everything.  It's just running worst of.  No, it was running worst of  and our live intros.  No, it's great.  It was the perfect topic, too.  Just talking about smelly balls  as you guys are trying to do.  Yeah, the bit  that horrible farts  for the show. 
[01:21:00]  The bit that was running  was called  G-Spots and Smelly Ball Bags.  And we wonder why  we don't have  mainstream success.  Yes.  What was that again?  G-Spots and Smelly Ball Bags.  That's great.  That's great.  Wow.  I'm sitting at home  waiting for the phone ring  to fucking get me  out of this hellhole.  During that.  It's going to happen.  What you might not have heard  during that worst of  was Norton was talking about  how he hadn't showered  for days  and made some girl  go down on him  and it just  smelt like vinegar  and the girl had to 
[01:21:30]  gag, stop,  and push off of him.  Fantastic.  That was outstanding.  That sure was  a perfect fucking storm, man.  That was a horrendous bit  with you guys  fucking up and doing  your ins and outs  live on the show.  And there were ins and outs  to like mundane stuff.  It's like Dick Clark.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, our stuff's mundane now, Sam?  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  The intros themselves,  I think the commentary  that Eric and me  were doing were mundane.  As I was listening to that,  I'm just like,  does this really need 
[01:22:00]  an explanation?  Yeah, I know.  Ron Perlman,  it's like,  hey, Ron Perlman,  he's an actor  and he's a...  It's like, yeah.  Yeah, what's that about?  Why can't...  What is this whole thing  about anyway?  Who's trying to justify  their jobs down the whole...  By doing this fucking...  By coming up with busy work  for people.  I have to read it.  Well, we've been told  that everything has to have  an introduction,  explanation,  and everything has to be  teased a million times.  Yeah, for the record,  we were told that we should...  The countdown was given to us  saying we'll do a countdown  and the hosting duties  were given to us.  You can't have a countdown 
[01:22:30]  unless someone's counting.  Right.  Yeah.  And they said,  you and E-Rock will host it.  E-Rock?  These instructions  were also passed down  by the same people  who had no idea  any of this was going on  on the channel.  Okay.  For the record,  that was E-Rock  that pointed out that,  yes, no one in management  has said anything about this.  Are they learning about it  for the first time right now?  Oh, yeah.  I forgot to mention it.  If they're even listening now...  We purposely asked the staff,  like, hey, everybody knows.  It's cool.  We're going to talk about it tomorrow.  Don't tell them  and let them find out the next day.  That's E-Rock Nagel.  That was his idea 
[01:23:00]  and that was his whole thing.  E-Rock Nagel.  Fucking E-Rock.  Sex Bagel.  Sex Bagel.  Oh, wow.  Hawk.  Hawk.  That didn't last long.  No.  One of my favorite  fucking bits, though.  Hawk moniker.  When we were doing  that assault on the media shit  and from around the corner  comes E-Rock  fucking flapping his wings.  Do we have that clip anywhere?  Is that online anywhere?  I'll fucking tweet that later today.  Look for a Foundry logo on it.  Yeah, I know.  I know.  I'll find it.  Whatever.  That's fine.  But, I mean,  you'd think if somebody  was so pissed off 
[01:23:30]  about their last name  being used in a negative context,  they would try really hard  not to make dumb mistakes like this.  Right.  It only helps us  push the Nagel word.  Yeah.  After a while,  it should get to the point  where we pat him on the back  and go like,  wow,  thank God that was Nagled.  Yeah.  Like,  you come back from a mission  and go,  you Nagled that mission.  Right.  That's not necessary.  That would have been great.  Yeah,  that's like a positive.  That's like a good,  positive thing.  Yeah.  Guys,  people are saying 
[01:24:00]  it might have been  a Quanspiracy.  Where was Troy Kwan  when this whole thing  was going on?  He was laughing  and relieved  that finally  somebody was going  to take shit  other than him tomorrow.  Yeah.  That's what Troy was doing.  Troy's been on the burner.  He wasn't having a good day.  He's been on the burner  a couple of days.  Yeah.  I mean,  this has been a rough week for Troy.  Why wasn't Troy  having a good day?  He was,  you know.  I think it's because  you guys have been  shitting on him  for three days in a row.  Yeah,  I think it's us  getting fucking with him.  What did we do?  And I think a little  What did we do?  I think a little  production piece too, 
[01:24:30]  kind of.  There's going to be  more to that too.  I thought he said  he liked the production piece.  No,  he must have.  Are you talking about  this production piece?  Airtime is Airtime.  What the?  Troy,  are you getting  your face fucked  by that homeless guy  with the golden voice,  Ted Williams?  Oh,  oh,  oh.  Oh,  God.  Oh.  That's gross.  I love how Sam  just closed the door 
[01:25:00]  in that production piece.  That's gross.  And then here,  that generic  door closing sound effect  we've heard on so many bits  that you've never heard  in real life.  It's funny too,  I looked through like  40 sound effects  of doors closing  just to find the one  that everybody recognizes.  fucking T-boy rules.  That is the best  because that's the one.  Click,  click,  click.  Derek and I decided  to go very minimalistic  on that.  Yes.  And I went in  to hear like  to voice after  he put it together  and he goes,  you know,  I was putting the 
[01:25:30]  sounds together  and I thought  he was going to say  it didn't work  and he was like,  it doesn't really  sound like sex.  It sounds like  face fucking.  And I said,  all right,  we should change it then.  Then it's face fucking.  You being in production  for so long,  there is a female scream  that is used everywhere.  Oh,  the,  uh,  it's that will.  Yeah,  that one.  It's a double scream  of a woman  that you'll see  in trailers  for movies  on every TV show.  Whenever a girl's screaming,  it's that fucking scream.  And I'm amazed  people are still using this. 
[01:26:00]  There's the other one too,  the will something,  Wilhelm scream.  The guy screaming.  Oh,  the guy screaming.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The girl screaming though  is so recognizable.  So why,  like,  why not just have  a chick scream?  Yeah,  if you're a production guy,  why wouldn't you just  grab somebody and say,  lazy.  Yeah.  It's easier to just  pull it off of the,  like,  they think no one  notices that fucking thing.  I,  I hear,  it takes me out of everything.  I'm like,  that ain't a real scream.  And then I hear the fire truck  that we use here all the time.  We don't,  knock,  knock.  When you hear the same  sound effect we did  for some fucking dick bit 
[01:26:30]  back,  back 10 years ago.  Yeah,  that's exactly what it is.  Takes you out of a movie.  I used to watch a lot of that  World's Wildest police chases  and stuff like that.  Oh,  and no car crash sounds like that.  Oh,  it's down.  It's down.  And how come that guy  in the helicopter  is all over the country  with his helicopter?  All right.  He's,  uh,  he's making a turn now.  Oh,  he just almost hit that person.  He almost hit that person.  I'm really just watching this  in a, 
[01:27:00]  in a room with a mic in front of me  and commenting on what I see  on these videos.  I'm nagling the whole thing.  He thought he was going  for a wild ride.  The only ride this guy's taking  is to the hospital.  Yeah,  I hate the way they end.  It's perfect.  He was running from the cops.  There's no more running now  unless he's running  from an ass rapist in prison.  Wait a minute.  So Eric and I were thinking  about like doing a new show,  but to just leave  Worstuck playing 
[01:27:30]  and Eric will hook it up.  That's beautiful.  Yeah,  that's a good show.  Yeah.  I would listen.  Well,  you know,  I wasn't sleeping.  Yeah,  you were asleep.  That's very tired.  Well,  good job,  Eric,  yesterday.  That wasn't a good job.  It was a terrific job.  No,  he fucked the whole thing up.  Gonna take a break.  Destroyed the illusion  of weekend programming.  Really did.  It was taped two days ago.  I know.  Joe DeRozan should be here  any minute.  We'll add him to the show.  Also,  Michu Kaku  is going to call on the show  because we want to know  what the fuck's going on  with the birds and shit.  And what does he know about it? 
[01:28:00]  I don't know.  What does a physicist  know about it?  I think there's some shifting  going on with this earth.  Shifting.  Is that one of the theories?  Yeah,  there's some shifting going on.  Did the big axis pole  hit him in the face?  We're finally getting winters  we had when we were growing up.  Yeah.  So,  I don't know.  We're cycling into some  new fucking weather pattern  or something.  Lots and lots of snow.  And also,  Jersey Shore started yesterday.  Yeah,  dude.  Yeah.  And fucking Dina  is an out of control bitch. 
[01:28:30]  Situation gave her  rookie of the year title.  Really?  Snooki's new...  What does that mean?  Dude,  she's the rookie in the house.  She gets to be rookie of the year.  Snooki's new friend is...  It's all...  It's going to be about  Snooki's new friend this year.  Dina.  Dina is going to be  the breakout star.  Why?  What does she do?  She's out of her fucking mind.  She showed up drunk.  Yeah,  she took like three shots  before she got to the house  and then she just started drinking  for the rest of the afternoon.  She got...  Uh-oh.  She's going to be one of these people  that kind of step in  for a quick cameo  and then they wind up going,  hey. 
[01:29:00]  Like Urkel.  Yeah.  She'll be like Urkel  and take over the show?  Yeah,  she's a regular.  No,  they need another broad.  Yeah.  Dina's going to be  on all the lunchboxes.  Is she any good looking?  Nah.  She's another fucking fire hydrant.  Looks a little like Snooki.  A little bit.  You like Snooki,  right,  A little bit.  With environmentalists  and park officials  we'll be meeting  with the directors  of the co-op board  here at 927  Fifth Avenue  to decide the fate  of pale male and...  Sorry,  that was a visual.  It was E-Rock  fucking making believe 
[01:29:30]  he's a hawk  in the background  of a live broadcast.  I didn't realize  how thin he was.  That was 2004.  Wow,  yeah.  We just started back up.  He was a lot thinner.  He sure was.  Much thinner.  Let me see that again.  Let's see.  And then they like fucking...  Is this a montage?  Then they made fun of E-Rock  by doing it  when they went back  into the studio.  Oh,  I got it.  Yeah,  that's funny.  Okay.  I thought it went  to the new studio.  Did you see how fast  he was running behind the...  I know.  There's no way he's moving that. 
[01:30:00]  Oh,  shit.  There's no way he's...  By choice,  I meant.  Basically,  E-Rock was hiding  as they were doing...  This morning,  the director of the  Audubon Society  along with environmentalists  and the officials  will be meeting  with the directors  of the co-op board  here at 927  on this avenue  to decide the fate  of Pale Male  and Lola.  Well,  this is apparently...  What did he yell?  I'll be there today.  Woo!  He was so happy  to work for the show.  Oh,  yeah.  That was back  in the old days. 
[01:30:30]  He's not going to move  like that for the show anymore.  No.  We fucking  beat the shit out of him  too many times.  He just goes on  message boards now  and bashes you guys.  We beat the enthusiasm  out of him years ago.  You got to break him  before you can build him up.  Well,  why don't we do  Jersey Shore clubs?  We can keep going.  What the fuck?  Why not?  Dina displays her vagina  for the sitch  without knowing it.  What?  Yeah,  this is what they get away  with on MTV.  She was flirting  with the situation.  She was a little intoxicated  and she started  taking her clothes off 
[01:31:00]  and she didn't realize  that she had...  Her vagina was shown.  Wow.  Yes,  your lucky hat.  Let's find your cowboy hat.  Dina is awkwardly cute  and we got a situation.  Here's my cowboy hat.  I can see it now.  I can see it.  You look good.  So you're like  waving in the air and stuff?  I have to go  if I'm in my bikini  like this.  Uh-huh.  And I just have a good time.  Oh, wow. 
[01:31:30]  Really?  Looks like a good time.  Everything looks situated.  Situated.  She slowly starts  to pull the dress on.  As she's doing that,  she's totally  getting butt naked.  Yeah.  You can't slide.  I don't want to listen  to Jersey Shore clips.  She just sounds like  a real just skank.  Oh, yeah.  She was drunk.  She was naked.  She was getting situated. 
[01:32:00]  Instead of listening  to these clips,  what was the gist  of the season premiere  for the third season?  You got Dina  who was Snooki's friend.  It was the Dina show,  really.  I mean, first of all...  They're introducing her  and making sure people  are comfortable with her, right?  Yeah, and the beef  between JWoww and Sammy Sweetheart  is, I mean,  worse than ever at this point.  A lot of fist fight?  Beef going on there?  Oh, yeah.  And what happened was  since Snooki is friends  with JWoww  and Dina is friends  with Snooki,  Sammy doesn't like  any of them.  There's a problem there.  Sammy could scrap, though.  I have no idea 
[01:32:30]  what you're talking about.  Sammy started laughing  at Dina  and Dina called her  the C-word.  No way.  Uh-uh.  That could cause a problem.  Sammy did not like that.  Uh-uh.  They started arguing  and then Sammy  and Snooki started arguing  and then JWoww and Sammy,  they went to fisticuffs.  Really?  They threw down.  And then what happened?  Then it was over.  You got to wait  until next week  to see what happens  in the fight.  Oh, I hate when they do that.  Oh, really?  It was like a little cliffhanger? 
[01:33:00]  Yeah, like,  oh, he's going to win the fight.  How many W's  in JWoww's name these days?  I believe...  Is he adding W's?  I think there's two at the end.  Two at the end.  So three in total.  Didn't, uh,  Sammy punch Ronnie too  or something?  No, that was in the, uh,  coming up later this season.  We already told everyone  that's happening.  Yeah.  Because Vinny told me  at a Jets game.  They showed it, uh, uh,  you know,  coming up later  that Sammy and Ronnie  break up  and then Ronnie becomes  friends with JWoww. 
[01:33:30]  They broke up last season.  But they break up again.  They're back together now.  And Sammy doesn't like that  so she punches Ronnie  in his face.  And what is, uh,  Pauly D doing  the whole time?  Uh, he was doing,  he was making burgers  for the guys.  T-shirt time!  Yep, T-shirt...  It's T-shirt time!  He's gonna be  the big star of the show.  Wait, wait,  let me hear that.  It's T-shirt time!  Let's say two-eye.  What's wrong with that? 
[01:34:00]  I, I, everything.  T-shirt time.  What the fuck is that?  You know,  put the T-shirt on  and go around.  We told you what  the T-shirt thing is.  I know,  but I still don't get it.  You hang out.  Why do they make  a thing out of it?  It's the shirt  before the shirt  and then someone  has to call,  like,  we're getting ready  to go out  so let's get our T-shirts on.  Why do they make  a thing out of it?  You don't want it all smelly.  Same reason why  it's an event  when the cabs come.  That's right.  When the cabs come.  Cabs here, cabs here!  Yeah.  See, I know this shit.  You don't have that clip?  No, no, no.  Can we hear  T-shirt time again?  It's T-shirt time! 
[01:34:30]  Yeah, he just did  a little making burgers  which hadn't been done before  and it was just  a real slip in.  I think it's going to be  something that's developed.  Is that going to be like a...  Because just for one quick second  he went,  making burgers for the guys!  Oh, so that's going to be  another catchphrase.  Yeah.  This guy's like  a catchphrase machine.  Probably D.  Beat that beat up.  He's going to be the...  Oh, I love that song.  It's a good song.  This fucking thing  gets stuck in your head.  I'm fist bumping.  Yeah. 
[01:35:00]  It's a good song.  Oh, now you're making  a dick song.  Just the hook  is what I like.  The whole thing  is the hook.  For hockey fans,  24-7 pens caps.  I forgot what team  they like playing that song  after they win  in the locker room.  They pump up that song  after a big victory.  Hockey time?  So now I like the fucking song.  That's how lame I am.  But Paulie D.  DJ Paulie D.  He's getting his own show,  Anthony.  Why?  First spinoff.  Why?  It's going to be  Paulie D.  and his friends. 
[01:35:30]  Yeah, well...  That's where they're going next  with this whole  Jersey Shore mess.  I'll watch Paulie D.'s show.  It's going to be on  in the fall.  Paulie D.  What is it going to be called?  I don't know  what it's going to be called.  I'm going to watch it.  I don't know what it's called.  I don't feel like  playing these clips.  I'm sorry, Sam.  You don't have to.  But I don't know.  It's too much,  this Jersey Shore,  for everybody to handle.  You could leave it  aside and play it later.  You can do whatever you want.  Or maybe I'll just  watch the show.  You could watch the show.  It's a good show.  Okay.  It's a good episode.  It's going to be  a great season. 
[01:36:00]  But the Jersey Shore  is great at having  like nine minutes  of really good stuff  and the rest of the hour  is just kind of  silly filler.  But the nine minutes  is good enough  to carry the whole thing.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I don't even understand  why they're doing this show.  I can't even get past  the concept anymore.  They're all famous now.  So they're pulling up  in like BMWs  and brand new Cadillacs  and stuff.  Whereas before  they all were like  just kids.  Shitty cars.  Now they all have  brand new cars.  They're expensive.  And they can't really 
[01:36:30]  even film a reality show  anymore because  wherever they go  the paparazzi follows.  So it takes away  from the reality aspect of it.  So the editing is all  like very strange now  because they got to  shoot around paparazzi  and all that.  It's very hard  to keep a reality show  going when it becomes  successful because  it doesn't have  the reality aspect  to it anymore.  Jersey Shore though.  Season 3.  Season 3 is here for us.  Okay.  We're losing steam.  We're going to take a break.  Joe DeRose is going  to join the program  and we're going to  hopefully have  Michu Kaku on  which means Troy  should be standing by  because Troy's suspicious 
[01:37:00]  about the birds  falling out of the sky.  He's going to be unhappy.  And I think Michu Kaku  will probably have  an angle on this.  A logical angle.  That's why we like  having him on the show.  Wow.  He'll talk to us  like children.  Well what if he just  comes on and says  no the world's going to end.  Or if he says  it's chemtrails.  Troy was right.  He will not agree  with chemtrails.  I think it is chemtrails.  He will bring up  contrails and nail it.  Alright what do we  want to ask him about?  Chemtrails?  Chemtrails.  Alright give me a list here.  The birds.  Aluminum in the air. 
[01:37:30]  The fish.  Birds, fish.  Aluminum yeah  being sprayed in the air  to combat global warming.  Aluminum.  Something as per.  And what about  the weather machine  in Abu Dhabi  in the desert?  Weather making it  rain in the desert.  Weather machine.  Damn I'm stealing  this pen.  This is a good one.  Take the pen.  The uniball.  Take the pen.  Vision e-light.  I like it.  The astronauts use it  in space.  Weather machine.  Okay. 
[01:38:00]  We got some stuff  to talk to him about.  I think Troy's  going to end up  being right about  all this stuff personally.  But that's just me.  He's got questions Sam.  I know.  He has a lot of questions.  He likes questioning things.  Well you guys  are guys that don't question.  That's crazy.  That's what's crazy.  Joe DeRozan in studio.  It's been a while.  What's up Joey?  Hey guys.  How are you? 
[01:38:30]  We jump right into it now.  Yeah.  Fuck that.  Good morning.  And thanks for listening  to the Opie and Anthony show.  Nah.  Filling in for the vacationing  Jimmy Norton.  Where's he vacationing?  He's not vacationing.  He's doing a Leno thing  out there.  He's in Arizona though.  For the BCS championship.  Is that what it is?  Yeah.  The biggest fucking college  football game of the year.  Oh.  The game.  Man.  I gotta start watching sports man. 
[01:39:00]  I literally know nothing.  I didn't even know what BCS was  when you said that.  I don't think you're missing it.  I don't know either.  Why don't you watch sports?  I never played them when I was a kid.  I sucked at them.  So I never got interested in them.  And I just never.  That was it.  Like I couldn't.  If I can't remotely do it,  I can't watch it.  You don't want to watch it.  You know?  Because I don't understand it.  I can't.  You know?  I can't fucking play hockey,  but I love watching it.  But you're athletic in other ways though, right?  I used to be. 
[01:39:30]  I was.  Yeah, I grew up playing a lot of sports.  But now I'm just.  I got the spine of an 80 year old man right now.  I can't fucking move too well.  Yeah, I've had that since I was 10.  I have a little problem with some herniated discs right now.  Oh, that sucks, man.  Did you do something to fuck them up?  Or did they just.  Was it just one of those things?  Maybe being a caddy at 12 years old  where you're carrying around fucking 100 pounds  of someone else's golf bags  probably crushed my spine. 
[01:40:00]  And now that I'm an older guy,  it's coming back to haunt me.  That sucks, man.  Yeah.  That really sucks, dude.  Or all the fucking pounding,  running up and down a basketball court.  I was a runner.  I was everything.  I still try to stay in shape,  but it's getting harder and harder.  Oh, my God.  Look who's on the phone though.  A Michu Kaku.  Hey, you know about the birds?  You hear this whole thing about the birds  falling out of the sky there in Arkansas?  Something about the birds,  they fell out of the sky.  They fell out of the sky, pretty much.  You don't know? 
[01:40:30]  Yeah, the birds, they were flying  and they fell out of the sky.  They fell down there.  No one has any clue.  Just sit back and watch.  There's a bunch of theories.  We'll get to your silliness in a minute.  We got serious stuff to discuss right now.  Dr. Michu Kaku.  Michu Kaku.  Hello.  Hello, Dr. Kaku.  It's always a pleasure when we have you on our show, sir.  Okay.  And by the way, Dr. Kaku has a book out.  It's Physics of the Future,  How Science Will Change Daily Life by 2100. 
[01:41:00]  That's, you know, the year, 2100.  Yeah, but the problem with the book, sir,  you have a flying car on the cover.  That's never going to happen.  By the year 2100,  I think you're going to be very wrong.  Really?  You could trust other people  with a fucking car in the sky?  We already have flying cars,  except they're very expensive.  Yeah, they're called airplanes.  No, no, no, no.  We have real flying cars.  I did a Discovery Channel program.  We filmed the flying car.  I saw that thing.  It's very expensive. 
[01:41:30]  Yes.  And the price will go down over the decades.  And we are talking about projecting to the year 2100.  Yeah, that's pretty far.  Yeah, but you're talking about people  trying to, like, navigate into Manhattan  without hitting buildings?  Yes.  We're talking about super magnets  using superconductivity.  Okay, now you're showing me a thing or two.  Using technology that we will harness  in the coming decades.  You know, so we're going to take the trust  out of the flying car equation.  Yeah, it's a question of economics.  You know, jet packs. 
[01:42:00]  Well, you know, jet packs are also possible today,  except they're just very expensive.  He's got an old-school phone.  I know.  Why do you have an old-school phone, sir?  That's just his ringtone.  Oh.  I'm sure of it.  Okay.  Has to be.  Dr. Kaku's there with an old,  one of those black phones  with a curly wire going there.  Hello.  Well, Dr. Kaku, let's get right into this.  A lot of controversy over the past week or so  with these birds flying,  falling out of the sky.  Right. 
[01:42:30]  We think we have the smoking gun.  We think we know what's happening here.  First of all,  you have the red-winged blackbird,  which flies in very tight formation,  unlike other birds,  which spread out.  We're going to be right there.  You follow the leader.  Watch this.  And if the leader gets disoriented  because of fireworks, thunderstorms, lightning,  microbursts, or whatever,  then the whole flock could commit mass suicide.  Wow.  Just like lemmings.  When the lead lemming goes off a cliff,  you have hundreds of thousands of lemmings 
[01:43:00]  that commit mass suicide.  The red-winged blackbird's eyesight is rather poor.  They're flying at night.  They get disoriented.  And the lead bird maybe makes a nose die  right into the ground or right into a house.  And they all just follow suit.  Well, they picked the wrong lead bird then.  Wow.  That's right.  The mass suicide.  Now, believe it or not,  these events take place every other year  in the United States.  16 recorded incidences over the last 30 years  involving over 1,000 blackbirds at a time. 
[01:43:30]  So these mass die-offs happen every other year,  except they don't attract media attention.  This time it did  because we have simultaneous die-offs  of fish and pelicans now  and birds in Sweden.  However, it is largely a coincidence  that all these events are taking place  pretty much at the same time.  The one problem I have,  you said every other year.  Why is this happening only every other year?  Approximately, on average,  16 events over the last 30 years 
[01:44:00]  is averaging about every other year.  Of course, it's not like clockwork.  We're talking about animals.  Okay, I got you.  But animal die-offs do take place rather regularly,  but they never make the national media.  Yeah, you see, now this did.  This did, and it got all hyped up,  and the press made like a frenzy out of it.  Right, a feeding frenzy with the Internet.  Imagine that.  Why would they do that?  People thought it was government secret experiments.  Right.  Yeah.  Saucers or whatever.  The HAARP Project.  You got the conspiracy people saying, 
[01:44:30]  you know, it's chemtrails.  It's, like Anne said, the HAARP Project.  Yeah.  But it's just, it is what it is.  You got a lead bird that gets confused,  and then there's a mass suicide happening.  See, that's what we were thinking.  Dr. Kaku, I also want to ask you about chemtrails  versus contrails.  Before we do that, I'm sorry,  because stay with the animals for a second.  The fish dying.  Yeah.  Because the...  We think we know what's happening there.  There are three possible culprits.  One is chemical poisoning.  One is pathogens or disease. 
[01:45:00]  And third is trauma.  And you can rule out chemical poisoning  because 95% of the fish that died in Arkansas  were of one species.  Ah.  Bottom-feeding drumfish.  If it was a chemical poisoning,  you'd get several species dying off.  So fucking smart.  However, it takes about a month to culture tissue  to make sure that it is disease.  So disease is the number one culprit, we think,  in the mass die-off of 100,000 drumfish, 
[01:45:30]  you know, off the coast of Arkansas.  Yeah.  What would trauma be, doctor?  You said trauma.  Yeah, well, for example, in the oceans,  we have the Navy using high-powered sonar.  Some people think that disorients the whales.  And you have mass beaching of whales,  which is, you know, rather unusual.  But these mass beachings of whales  usually take place in the vicinity of sonic tests  by our subs.  And so the Navy, as a precaution, 
[01:46:00]  is now restricting some of its sonar tests  so that we don't disorient animals in the ocean.  It's whales.  Yeah.  It's in a way of our military.  And then they die in the beach like that.  So now we've explained the birds and the fish.  And now, yeah, Ed wants to know about this.  Contrail versus chemtrail.  Have you heard about the chemtrails  that people are talking about?  You mean that launching of an object  off the coast of Los Angeles  just about two months ago?  No, but we could talk about that, too. 
[01:46:30]  Well, that was probably not an ICBM.  It was probably not a rocket.  It was probably an airplane, believe it or not.  And the reason for that is that  if you look at the velocity of that object  taking off Los Angeles,  it didn't accelerate.  If it was a ballistic missile,  it would be accelerating at about 15,000 miles per hour.  And it didn't accelerate at all.  It was at constant velocity.  And it also executed mid-course maneuvers. 
[01:47:00]  Ballistic missiles execute minor maneuvers,  not large maneuvers.  Yeah.  So we tend to think it was an airplane.  And, you know, if you live next to an airport,  you see these trails of water vapor all the time.  Yeah, yeah.  See, it's not chemicals.  It's, you know, contrails.  It's water vapor.  Right.  Yes, exactly.  I want to believe in conspiracies  because the real answers are too boring.  They're always more fun.  They certainly are more fun, Dr. Michi Kaku,  whose new book is called Physics of the Future, 
[01:47:30]  a book I certainly will read.  I like that.  Coming out in March.  Coming out in March.  Good.  What are some of the things  we're going to look forward to in the year 2100?  Well, something that we're going to have  within maybe 10 years' time.  I would say nothing.  The Internet will be so compact,  it'll be in your contact lens.  Contact lens?  What if we don't wear them?  Miss out.  Well, you know, if you have Internet  in your contact lens,  you'll be able to identify anyone's face.  When you talk to somebody, 
[01:48:00]  you'll see the complete biography  right next to their face.  Uh-oh.  And you'll see subtitles.  Subtitles, if they speak in Chinese or German.  Oh, wow.  That's okay.  Your contact lens will translate on the fly  what the person is saying  and put it right underneath that person's face  as you talk to that person.  If you're an artist,  you'll be able to recreate  any kind of sculpture with your hands  just by waving your hands in space.  And your contact lens will then create  this image of a beautiful work of art  that you're creating. 
[01:48:30]  Architects will love this  because architects will be able to  create buildings and rooms and furniture  just in the contact lens  by waving their hands.  Doctor, I already see all these things  when I talk to people.  Does that mean there's something wrong with me?  Well, there's a theory that says yes.  And in addition,  if you are a student  taking a final examination,  these contact lens could save your life.  How's that?  Because you'll be able to see  the exam answers in your contact lens  as you take the final. 
[01:49:00]  Well, I bet they'll say  no contact lenses during the final.  Well, how does it tell?  They'll have to pop that out.  I don't want to talk about things  that are going to be around in 2100  because we're not going to be around.  I want to know what's going to happen  in our lifetime.  Well, he was just saying  that's like 10 years.  Yeah, 10 years.  That's a 10-year thing.  The Internet's a biggie.  I like, you know what I really like,  Dr. Kaku,  is all the information  that's available now  right at our fingertips  with our various smartphones.  Where are these going to be headed  in the next few years? 
[01:49:30]  Well, we sort of know the answer.  The future of the computer  is going to pretty much disappear.  It'll be everywhere and nowhere.  The wallpaper, for example,  will be intelligent.  So when you put wallpaper up,  you'll be putting up computers.  It's already more intelligent  than some of the people  we have working for us, Dr. Kaku.  That's right.  Flexible computer screens  already exist.  Yes.  And they're going to get cheap enough  so they will be able to,  you know, use wallpaper,  which is intelligent.  So the next time 
[01:50:00]  you want a wall screen,  you just talk to the wall  and there's your wall screen.  You want to redecorate the house,  you simply talk to the wall  and the house redecorates itself.  Talk to the wall.  It changes color, right.  So it would be just a TV screen virtually.  Wow, how cool that is.  And then you could change the...  Your entire wall,  basically a gigantic TV screen.  Can you make it into a jungle theme?  You could.  Can you make your wall  into a jungle theme  by just talking to it?  Well, yeah, anything you want.  Even glass will be intelligent.  We have intelligent glass  already in the laboratory. 
[01:50:30]  So as you look out the window,  if you don't like what you see,  you can simply change what you see.  Could we do that  to an engineering studio room  off of our main studio?  If we don't like what we see,  we can just tint it  so we don't have to look at...  Can I do that  to the faces of the women  I sleep with?  Yeah, well,  now you can change it  to be anything you want.  You simply talk to the glass  and intelligent glass already exists.  We have PC screens  that are totally transparent  and as you talk to the window,  you can pretty much  change it into anything you want.  So the point here 
[01:51:00]  is that computer power  is going to be so cheap  and so plentiful  that everything around us  will be intelligent,  maybe except us.  I think it's pretty obvious  that within a few years,  entire walls  are going to be TVs.  It could be, right,  because the cost of computers  drops by half  every 18 months.  Right.  So if you simply  extend this out  to 10 years,  computers will be  1,000, 10,000 times  cheaper than they are now.  Yeah, but the TVs  are getting bigger  and more affordable  and, yeah,  I think you're going to see  ridiculous TVs 
[01:51:30]  in everyone's places.  Well, Max...  In fact,  even your clothing  is going to be intelligent.  Oh, boy.  If you have a heart attack today,  you know,  you can just die  on a lonely country road.  In the future,  your clothes will upload  your entire biography,  medical history,  call an ambulance,  and locate your position  by GPS,  all if you are unconscious.  Just don't wash it.  You'll never die alone.  Oh.  It's like OnStar  in your shirt.  That's pretty cool.  Hey,  you'll have a doctor  in your clothing  in the future.  I don't like that. 
[01:52:00]  Hey,  we want to ask about  another thing  that happened  very recently,  the weather machine.  I think it was  in the desert  of Abu Dhabi.  Yeah.  Was that real  or was that  some fake newspaper  or whatever?  Well,  there's no such thing  as weather modification.  That is maybe  100 years  into the future.  But they said  they made it rain  50-something times  in the desert.  Well,  I've been to Abu Dhabi  several times  and I tell you  the deserts  are dry there  and if they could  make it rain 
[01:52:30]  they would make  a lot of money  but I tend to doubt  that story.  Ah,  he tends to doubt  that then.  Okay.  Yeah,  we don't have  any real proof.  I like that.  You would think  they would have  had video of it  if they're making  it rain in the desert,  right?  Doctor,  no,  the CIA tried  very hard  during the Vietnam War  to modify the weather  during the monsoon season  in Vietnam.  They failed.  The CIA can't do it.  Wait,  did you know this,  that during the Vietnam War?  They were trying to,  how did they try?  I was involved in it,  Opie.  I died ice crystals  by seeding the clouds.  They hoped to induce  the monsoons  over the Viet Cong  so that the Viet Cong 
[01:53:00]  guerrillas would be  washed out.  Just got them mad.  So they tried to  use that as a military  weapon, basically,  and they failed.  Oh, wow.  Apparently,  Lex Luthor  was running  the Vietnam War.  Mr. Luthor.  Luthor.  Very good.  Did you see,  Dr. Kaku,  did you see  this coming  with computers  really pretty much  getting rid of  the typical  tower-based  computer in your house?  Did you see  this coming 
[01:53:30]  where it would be  really at your fingertips  in these smartphones?  Yeah,  pretty much.  I wrote a book  called Visions  in the late 1990s  where I predicted  what was going to happen  by the year 2010,  2020,  2030,  and we're right  on schedule.  If you read my book,  the predictions I made  are right on schedule.  Really?  Computer power.  We have Moore's Law.  We can predict  with very good accuracy  how powerful  and how cheap  computers are going to be  because prices drop  every 18 months.  You know what,  but there is  the human factor 
[01:54:00]  in there  that's very hard  to factor  into something like that.  I understand  working with numbers  and knowing that  the computer prices  will drop  and the technology  gets better  over a fixed rate  that you guys  can pretty much predict,  but there's the human factor  of what we wanted.  Now,  what I wanted  back in the 90s  was a big computer,  a big monitor,  all that stuff,  not knowing that  in a few years  I would want  a very small  handheld computing device 
[01:54:30]  like my iPhone  and my television,  being at a flat screen  on the wall,  is now turning more  into a hybrid  of my computer  and my television  with the likes  of things like  Apple TV  and Netflix  and all the other  ways to deliver  the media  to my house.  See,  I didn't see that coming.  Yeah,  in fact,  I'm not a scientist.  Neumann,  the mathematical genius  who helped  to create  the electronic computer,  he made three predictions  in the 1950s  about the future  of his invention.  All three predictions 
[01:55:00]  were wrong.  Really?  He said that only governments  would be able  to afford computers.  Second,  that computers  would be so fantastic  if we can compute  the weather.  And third,  computers will only  be controlled  by the elite  and by small groups  of people.  Now we know  that computers  instead of becoming bigger  became smaller,  more powerful,  and that weather prediction  is still impossible  with a computer.  Yeah,  it's gotten a little  more accurate,  but they still don't know. 
[01:55:30]  I love that.  They get on  and still just don't know.  They have to guess  and say,  we think  if the weather  takes this track  that will get  this amount of snow,  you would think  by now  it would be  an exact science.  Yeah,  but we have  something called  chaos theory.  I know,  we all saw  Jurassic Park.  Right.  The drip of water.  The chaos theory  basically says  that when you have  very large numbers  of molecules  and large numbers  of particles,  it's extremely  difficult to predict.  In fact,  a modern computer  is impossible 
[01:56:00]  to exactly predict  the weather.  You can only predict  general features,  qualitative features,  not quantitative features.  Right.  So chaos theory  means that the stock market,  the weather,  the coast of a seashore,  these are things  which are rather  unpredictable,  even with our best computers.  So weather modification  is going to be  beyond our control  for quite a while.  I just read a bunch  of stuff online  about butterfly effect  and chaos theory.  I just wanted  to say those.  I did, 
[01:56:30]  because I feel  like I know something.  What did you think  about it,  Joe DeRosa?  I thought the movie  was a poor representation  of the theory  and the effect.  We have a movie critic here.  Yeah, no,  I think that stuff's  really interesting,  the theory of everything.  I was reading about  the theory of everything.  Yeah, that's what I do  for a living.  Yeah, it's incredibly complex.  But actually, doctor,  is there a book  you can recommend?  I mean,  I would like to read  some of your stuff,  but even reading it  on Wikipedia  is confusing. 
[01:57:00]  I mean,  is there a book  that kind of...  Yeah, well,  get a copy of my book  Hyperspace.  Okay.  It was a national bestseller  when it came out.  It's the first major book  on string theory  and the theory of everything.  Oh, my God,  I can't read about string theory.  String theory is fascinating,  but I find you have to read  the same paragraph  like a million times.  Three or four times  before you know it.  Yeah, I could barely read  about string cheese  and understand it.  It's one of those books  where you feel your brain  exploding in front of your eyes.  Yes, Dr. Kaku,  I do understand that. 
[01:57:30]  It's very...  It is a concept.  Unless you're you  or one of your colleagues,  it's very hard for the layman,  even when it is put in  what you people think of  as layman's terms,  very hard to wrap your mind around it,  even if you understand the words.  You know what I mean?  Well, you know,  if you understand music,  you can understand string theory.  Here it is.  Here's the analogy for the dummy.  How...  Dr. Kaku,  how is music like a string theory?  Because everything you see around you  is basically the lowest octave 
[01:58:00]  of tiny little vibrating strings.  Electrons, protons, neutrons,  they're nothing but the lowest octave.  The next higher octave  is dark matter,  which we find in outer space,  which is invisible.  But we represent,  you know,  representing by electrons,  neutrons, protons,  they're nothing but little  tiny vibrating strings  vibrating in the lowest octave.  Vibrating.  See, I still...  So, chemistry is nothing  with the melodies  you can play on these strings.  What?  The universe is a symphony of strings.  The universe is a symphony of strings. 
[01:58:30]  And the mind of God  that Albert Einstein  eloquently wrote about  would be cosmic music  resonating through  11-dimensional hyperspace.  All right.  Finally, it's spelled out  in a way I can...  Now I can understand.  I can wrap my mind around that.  I learned about...  I seriously learned about this stuff  from listening to Frank Zappa.  Frank Zappa used to talk about this a lot.  Like...  Did he?  He used to talk about,  like, the great vibration  and everything was a musical note  and music was the thing  that defined everything.  He should have been talking  about his prostate.  I know.  I'm getting that checked out. 
[01:59:00]  Might still be around.  Why do you ignore that?  There's a lot to talk about then.  His prostate was made out of music.  Oh, I had something  I wanted to talk to Dr. Kago.  I wanted to ask him  another question.  The aluminum?  No, no.  And other things  that the government is doing?  Just cool, like, yeah,  physics stuff.  Futuristic stuff.  Space and...  Yeah, but, you know,  my mind's so full of things.  Right.  It just oozes out my ears.  Well, have we covered it all?  Is there something else  happening in the world  that we should cover?  Michu, Kaku? 
[01:59:30]  Yeah.  In the coming months,  we're going to discover  not just one,  but perhaps dozens  of Earth-like twins  in outer space.  Planets, perhaps,  with oceans,  liquid oceans,  and this is the  Kepler satellite  currently orbiting  the Earth right now,  which is going to  log on to  small Earth-like planets  in outer space,  and that's going to  give us an existential shock.  At night,  when you look at  the night sky,  you'll realize that  in many of the  familiar constellations,  there are planets  that look very much 
[02:00:00]  like the Earth,  and we'll wonder  whether or not  anyone's looking back  at us,  wondering whether or not  Earth has any life on it.  Yeah, isn't it a bitch  we can't just kind of,  you know,  span that gap,  gap and really  kind of check out  other beings?  It's frustrating.  Frustrating.  This is going to be  in the next few months.  The Kepler satellite  has been orbiting  around for over a year  and getting evidence  of hundreds of  large planets,  but now we hope  to get zero in  on small planets,  Earth-like planets,  and then the question is, 
[02:00:30]  is there any life  on these planets?  Yeah.  We're going to then  zero in on radio emissions  and see whether or not  any of these planets  emit radio.  It's kind of embarrassing  when we were growing up,  we were told there were  how many planets?  I even forgot the number.  Nine.  There are 500 planets  now we've discovered  in Earth.  500, which means  it's 5 million.  We were told there were  nine in our own solar system.  Yeah, but they pretty much  said nine.  Yeah.  We weren't talking about  other solar systems.  They're like,  no, there's pretty much  one solar system  that has nine planets.  That's sort of what  we learned growing up.  Yeah.  But now we've identified 
[02:01:00]  over 500 solar systems  in our space.  It is ridiculously arrogant  to be like,  I'm going to recreate  the entire solar system  with these styrofoam balls.  This is all of it.  That's what we did.  That's all it is.  All you need to know about  will never go further than this.  Here you go, teach.  Dr. Kaku,  I want to ask you  an Einstein question.  Okay.  I was watching a program  the other day,  and of course,  I love Einstein  and his famous theory  of relativity 
[02:01:30]  and traveling  at the speed of light  and how it is not attainable  because mass increases  as we approach  the speed of light  and it would become  impossible to power  something past  a certain speed.  Right.  All I could think of is  what's this crazy-haired guy  telling everybody this  and all of a sudden  it's law?  Like, how does he know?  And how did he know?  And why is it so  why is it the law  now that everybody accepts? 
[02:02:00]  Well, first of all,  we measured every single day.  Your GPS system,  for example,  would go bonkers  if Einstein was wrong.  Pentagon generals  have to be briefed  on Einstein's theory  of relativity  or else they cannot  fight a war.  We're talking about  atomic bombs,  GPS,  your iPod,  this phone conversation.  All of it  is a direct consequence  of Einstein's theory  of relativity.  Thank God for that guy.  A modern society  would collapse  if it wasn't  for the contributions  of Einstein.  So relativity 
[02:02:30]  is tested  every single microsecond  we test relativity.  Now, I understand  relativity is easy  to kind of grasp  things being relative  to other things.  I understand that.  It's this concept.  What?  Well, it is  things being relative.  I understand relativity,  you know,  things being relative  to other things.  No, I take into consideration  relativity  on a daily basis.  I do think about  things relative 
[02:03:00]  to my car  being inside the car  and outside the car.  There's a relationship  to the speed  of the vehicle,  the speed of things  outside my vehicle,  and the relativity.  Like, if somebody's  behind me  and they're doing  the same speed  I'm doing,  relative to me,  we might as well  be parked.  Right.  And also,  time is relative.  Yes.  So it's a different race  throughout the universe.  Not if you do a radio show.  Time beats faster on the moon.  Some days are longer  than others.  But, yes.  Time beats faster on the moon  than it does on the Earth.  Yeah, I wish this show  was on the moon.  Last month,  and they have a big moon 
[02:03:30]  in the background  of the TV set,  and I told Conan  that time beats faster  on that moon  than on the Earth,  and time beats slower  on Jupiter  than it does on Earth.  Ah.  So time is also relative.  And this is because of,  is this because of mass?  Uh, because of gravity.  Large gravity speeds up time.  That's what I meant  by mass, by the way.  We gravity slows down time,  and I guess we measure this  with our satellites.  GPS would go bonkers  if it wasn't for you.  Now, why, though,  as an object approaches  the speed of light, 
[02:04:00]  does it gain more mass?  This seems to me  something I cannot grasp.  Well, first of all,  the energy  is being turned into mass.  That's why it gets heavier.  Oh.  And the exact equation  of the energy  turning into mass  is E equals MC squared.  Yes.  That is precisely  how much mass  is accumulating  as you go faster  and faster and faster.  So the very fact  that we have hydrogen bombs  is a consequence  of E equals MC squared  is a consequence  of the fact  that your speed of energy  energy 
[02:04:30]  turns into mass.  You get heavier.  E equals mass  to the speed of light squared.  Yeah.  Right.  And that,  oh, so the energy itself  is converted to mass.  That's right.  That's right.  So then the more energy  you need to move this mass  is creating more mass.  You got it.  Holy Jesus, Dr. Kaku.  That's right.  Oh.  Yeah, you got it.  You have just,  I think Anthony  missed his calling.  This is a moment for me  that most people 
[02:05:00]  have had in the 50s.  All right, Danny.  Stomp on my parade.  Or rain on it.  Stomp on my parade.  Blah on my parade.  Oh, Dr. Kaku.  No, believe me.  What happened?  It is,  thank you.  I finally got a grasp on it.  All right.  Why don't we let  the good doctor go?  Yes, after that,  where else are we going?  Dr. Kaku,  thank you so much.  Okay.  Physics of the Future,  how science will change  daily life  by the year 2110. 
[02:05:30]  Out in March.  And I also believe  you do a show for XM,  don't you, sir?  Well, I do a show  for the Science Channel.  Yes.  Sci-Fi Science.  I'm the host.  I love that show.  No, we know that,  but I thought you were  heard on XM  from time to time.  A little radio.  On this show.  I'm on talk radio.  I'm on 130 radio stations  around the country.  Commercial radio stations.  Yeah.  I've got 130 shows.  Hey, that's very good.  And I love your show  on Science Channel.  It's amazing.  Everything about time travel, 
[02:06:00]  lightsabers, ray guns.  Yeah.  Ronald ray guns.  Yes.  It's a great show.  It's a great show  because it just makes up stuff.  I love that.  It's great.  No accountability.  It's just that series.  It's great.  It must be nice  to be the smartest man  in the room.  You can just say  whatever you want.  Oh, my God.  All right, pal.  Okay.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you so much,  Dr. Kaku.  Yes, yes.  There he goes.  All right.  Wow.  Talk about theory of relativity.  What the fuck is going on there? 
[02:06:30]  Where did that picture come from?  Your sister just posted  an old picture of you  about 30 seconds ago.  My sister should be shot for that.  Adam Ferrara?  Yeah, it is.  Me and Adam Ferrara.  No shit.  Adam Ferrara looks the same.  Anthony looks like the big ragu.  That is fantastic.  They're chilling.  Wow.  That's me and Adam  before we did anything.  Holy shit.  But Anthony,  we can talk about the picture,  but right after the Dr. Michu Kaku,  kind of a new bit,  we want to start doing.  Yes? 
[02:07:00]  Is the Dr. Steve rebuttal.  Oh, shit.  Dr. Steve hates Dr. Michu Kaku.  Well, let me tell you something.  I had an epiphany right there  with Michu Kaku.  Yeah, and Dr. Steve knows  a little bit about physics,  right, Dr. Steve?  Intelligent wallpaper.  I can't wait  for the future.  What's the problem, Dr. Steve?  You're not a fan  of the intelligent wallpaper theory?  I don't know.  It seems somewhat  of a mundane application  of what could be cool. 
[02:07:30]  I could just see  some housewife  cleaning off some kid  that crayoned  over the intelligent wallpaper,  spraying fantastic on it  and ruining the screen.  So basically,  the entire future  is just designed  to make some fat-ass housewife  not have to work anymore?  Yeah.  That's it.  That's it.  And it would be nice  for a maybe young future Anthony  to see virtual spaghetti  and meatballs and sauce  running down the wall  after Dad virtually throws it  at the wall in an argument.  Instead of the actual 
[02:08:00]  spaghetti and meatballs,  it could be just an image  on the intelligent wallpaper.  If that's the worst,  the connect.  You make the motion.  It's connect wallpaper  where Dad throws the spaghetti,  but he still has to  literally hit Mom.  Yeah, do you think  she'll have a virtual black eye  that you can just wipe away?  She'll look normal  until she looks  into the wallpaper  and then Dad will be like,  see, if you want to look  like that for real. 
[02:08:30]  Oh my God.  So you didn't dig  the wallpaper.  Yeah, the intelligent wallpaper.  What else?  What about flying cars  based on...  This is your rebuttal.  Yeah, here's the thing  with the flying cars.  We have to...  If we're going to  truly do this,  we need a room temperature  semiconductor.  Now, they're coming  very close  to having one,  but you still have to  immerse the ones  that we have now  in liquid nitrogen. 
[02:09:00]  Very cold.  Before that,  you had almost  to be at absolute zero.  So they're getting closer.  Whether just...  Speaking of absolute zero,  do you hear the EROC segment?  EROC segment?  He's shaking his head.  He thought he was  off the hook.  Oh, EROC.  But you gotta take  the human element  out of the flying car equation.  Of course.  But then it becomes  public transportation  that flies.  It's called an airplane.  Yeah, I mean,  to have true freedom 
[02:09:30]  in a flying car  would be insane  if you think about it.  Fuck up in two dimensions  too much every day.  Never mind adding altitude.  But don't you also  have to, doctor...  You have more room  in three dimensions, though.  So there's...  You know,  it may actually be  less likely  that you'll run into somebody.  It's much more likely  when you're flying  one little road.  Just imagine  the commute into New York.  Thousands and thousands  of fucking cars  in the sky.  Really, there's not  going to be any problems.  Will there be lanes?  Because then there's  just traffic again.  Yes.  Then it's just traffic 
[02:10:00]  in the sky.  Why would you have lanes?  If they have lanes,  in the sky,  it would look like  Coruscant from Star Wars.  Exactly.  That's what I want  it to look like.  You geek.  I love it.  Doctor,  I love it.  Doctor,  to Opie's point,  though,  don't you have to consider  like what Opie's saying  about like,  you know,  they can't...  People wouldn't be able  to handle flying cars.  When you predict  or theorize  on what's going to happen  in the future,  don't you have to  also incorporate  the concept  that our understanding 
[02:10:30]  and capability  with these progressions  will be higher?  Do you understand  what I'm saying?  Like,  we'll have a greater  understanding of something  like a flying car  in a hundred years  and how to use it  versus if it just  popped up now.  Does that make sense?  Yeah.  It does make sense.  I think ultimately  it'll be computer controlled  and the problem  with that is  is what happens  when the computer crashes  then you've got  a million people  in the sky  and they're all  falling to their doom.  But that can happen 
[02:11:00]  now with the airlines.  Aren't they  computer operated  duck?  Well,  not really.  I mean,  there's not a single  computer system  that's making  all these...  Guy works his whole life.  Joe just goes,  Guy works his whole life.  He's got to take this shit.  I know.  Guy actually went to school,  got an education,  becomes a doctor,  and he's just shit  on biopie.  I've been in  JetBlue planes.  They're already  very computer savvy. 
[02:11:30]  But at least  the pilot...  He's got nothing  but flat screens  in front of him now.  The professional  pilot element  is still there.  He still has  basic gauges  if all that shit  fails.  Oh, really?  Like on the ground.  Where's the yoke?  When you have nothing  but flat screens  in front of you  and they break down.  No, he's got a yoke  in front of him.  I've never seen a yoke.  Yeah.  Sometimes they've got  the joystick  on the side, too.  They don't even have  the yoke.  They've got a little  joystick on some  of those planes.  But you still have  the human element  that if the plane  is still running  and all the ground 
[02:12:00]  shit is out,  he could still  land the plane.  Now, a flying car,  if we were just  dependent on computers  because the people  are too stupid  to even drive  regular cars,  never mind flying ones,  so that they're  completely computer run  and you just kind of  sit in it,  then we're asking  for trouble.  Not really,  because the computers  will be better  at that point.  I think so,  but then we'll be  asking for trouble  more if the computer  fucks up.  True.  That's what I was  saying earlier.  You've got to take  into account we're  going to have  a hundred more  years of understanding  to us. 
[02:12:30]  Do you know what I  mean?  It would be like  throwing a guy  into a flying car  today.  How much fun  would that be,  though?  It would be awesome.  I would love to see  that.  But how about  throwing a guy  from the 1500s  into a Ferrari  today?  That would kind of  be, he crashed  the thing in his  second.  Yeah, yeah.  That's what I'm  saying.  You're thinking  like, if we,  in the future,  we'll probably be  able to deal with  that shit,  our brains will  be better equipped.  That's what I'm  saying.  If you showed  Ben Franklin  an iPod, 
[02:13:00]  excuse me,  doctor, let me  theorize here for a  second.  If you showed  Benjamin Franklin  an iPod,  he'd say,  big shit,  do you know I  couldn't look at  these if I didn't  invent these glasses,  motherfucker?  That's what he'd  say.  He'd probably have a  stroke.  He'd be like,  you know what I  mean?  He didn't sit  through the  stair step of  technology to get  to the iPod.  Where is the  pornography, sir?  That's what he'd  be.  He was quite the  ladies' man,  that Ben Franklin.  That's why he was  bald like that.  He loved the  poise.  Oh, he loved it.  Especially if it  was French.  He used to go to 
[02:13:30]  France all the time.  You know what it  would fucking  maybe make it  there just for  that French pussy.  That guy loved it.  He sacrificed  getting scurvy to  get some fucking  twat.  He had syphilis,  didn't he?  Didn't he die  from syphilis?  Everyone did.  Who didn't have  syphilis back in  those days,  Dr. Steve?  That was like  the common cold.  Was that very  common, Dr. Steve?  I don't know if  you know that,  but was it back  then in the day  as they call it?  Yeah, there were  quite a few famous 
[02:14:00]  people that had  syphilis back in  the day.  We just didn't have  treatment for it  so it'd be  fucked around  and, you know,  it was easy to  spread.  Oh my God.  Let's see,  Scott Joplin  had syphilis.  Gauguin,  the painter,  had syphilis.  Gauguin.  Yeah.  Al Capone.  Well, Al Capone,  yeah.  Al Capone died  of it.  E.D. Amine  had syphilis.  E.D. Amine?  Jesus.  Didn't he?  Yeah, I would  just say yes.  Didn't Mother  Teresa have it? 
[02:14:30]  Mother Teresa  had the clap.  She had chlamydia.  I would assume  she had the  hep A.  She had hep A.  The hep A.  Dr. C.,  what do you know?  You kill old  people for a living.  Oh, no, he doesn't.  He helps them.  He helps them  and gives them  comfort in their  last days.  He makes their  last week feel  terrific.  As they take  that ride over  the horizon  to the unknown.  The boat ride.  He puts the  fucking silver  dollars on their 
[02:15:00]  eyes.  and gives  the change  for the  ferryman.  We know  what the  ride over  the horizon  is.  Fucking  Dr. Steve  knows the  ferryman by  his first  name.  Yeah, I got  another one  for you.  The thing from  the Crash of the  Titans.  And the ride  over the horizon  is a nice  steep cliff.  Right, Dr. Steve?  Yes.  Dr. Steve's never  seen a spirit  come out of  anyone.  Have you ever  felt a weird  feeling when  someone passes  that an electric  feeling? 
[02:15:30]  anything?  No, but it  is interesting  the line  between being  alive and  being dead  because, you  know, someone  is right  close to  death, but  they still  are animated.  And when  they pass  away, it's  just not  that person  isn't there  anymore.  It is, it's  really a, it's  hard to put  into words, but  it is.  Well, why don't  you try?  I think of  it as unplugging  the microwave  when it's  spinning around. 
[02:16:00]  Like it's  alive, it's  moving, it's  cooking something,  and then it's  just not.  That's what I  think it is,  too.  Blackness and  nothingness.  Who's that  politician in the  80s that killed  himself during the  press conference?  Oh, Arba Dwyer.  Arba Dwyer.  Did you ever  watch that footage?  It's disturbing to  watch how  instantaneous the  life has gone.  It's really  creepy.  What do you think  happens when you  die, doctor?  Do you believe  anything afterwards  or nothing,  right?  Well, I mean,  you know, there's  the part of me  that grew up a  Methodist, and 
[02:16:30]  so I, you  know, I have  that in my  world view.  It's a  Methodist to his  madness.  But then, you  know, the  scientific part of  me is, you  know, does  struggle with  that.  Now, there is  a certain form  of immortality,  though.  In an infinite  universe, we  would have  counterparts  elsewhere in  the universe  that are  exactly like  us, because  in an infinite  universe, if  you take a  small volume  of space, 
[02:17:00]  you know, there's  a finite number  of particles.  Did you guys  hang up on me  again?  No, no, no.  It's actually  interesting what  you're saying.  That is so  funny.  It's like, did  you hang up  on me again?  He's so  paranoid.  Why are you  so paranoid?  That is so  funny.  I was, well,  continue, because  it's very  interesting.  I was digging  that, because  it's like, if  something's infinite,  what you're  saying is, if  it's infinite,  there is  definitely, it's  not even  questionable, it's 
[02:17:30]  definite that  there will be  exact duplicates  of things, based  on infinite,  right.  Or a stage  one.  Oh, you know  he's still  talking.  That was a  team effort,  by the way.  He's still  talking.  He and I  looked at each  other like,  this has to  happen.  We huddled  on that one.  That poor  fuck.  I love Dr.  Steve, by  the way.  Dr.  Steve is the  shit.  Weird Medicine  is his show. 
[02:18:00]  It's here on  the virus.  I don't know  when the next  episode is, but  I'm sure we  never.  No!  Next week,  Dr.  Steve's Weird  Medicine.  He's really,  really good on  it.  He's a great  friend, a great  pal, and a  shitty winemaker.  Dr.  Steve.  And eats like  shit, as he  tells you, you  should eat  healthier.  And he  played Joseph  this past  holiday season.  Did he?  Unquestioned  for next time.  Oh, and that  was for  sleeves?  And his  wife might  have played  Mary.  Sleeves?  No, just 
[02:18:30]  church shit.  Wasn't he  involved in a  sleeves project?  Maybe.  Sleeves rules.  Shut up.  You hear the  River Rat  Dock song yet?  Just stop  with sleeves.  You hear the  River Rat  Dock song yet?  No.  What's that?  What is it?  What's the  River Rat  Rat Dock?  What?  That's River  Rat Dock on  Twitter.  Oh, no.  What happened?  Oh, yeah, we  get the text  messages.  I just got a  text.  Where he  writes us all  and goes, oh,  that was really  funny, but you  know he's really  hurting inside as  he writes that.  You fucks.  Yeah. 
[02:19:00]  Yeah.  The good doctor  just said, you  fucks.  Hey, where's  Troy Kwan?  Because all his  conspiracies were  knocked out of the  air like those  fucking birds were.  Exactly.  Where's the  Troy Kwan before  we go to break?  And Joe DeRosa,  where are you going  to be?  I'm going to be  at CB's in the  West Village all  weekend.  And I also have a  show every Tuesday  night at the Ace of  Clubs in Manhattan.  It's called Righteous  Kill.  It's a fun show.  Yeah, man.  It's been too long.  Yeah, yeah.  Come down, you know?  Come hang out, people.  Hang out.  It's like five bucks, 
[02:19:30]  man.  And we had Bobby Kelly  a couple weeks ago.  We're going to have  Keith Robinson, I think,  next week.  I follow you on  Twitter, and I do  have a complaint that  I have for a lot of  the comics, except  Jimmy Norton.  You know, plugging  the gigs on Twitter,  I have no problem  with that.  But how about a  little just extra fun  stuff every so often?  Yeah, how about a  fucking one-liner?  I'll bash fucking,  you know who I'll  bash the most for  that?  Louis C.K.  But he doesn't  care.  But I know, but  sometimes Louis just  gets drunk and starts  going off about Sarah  Palin. 
[02:20:00]  That's kind of funny.  But for the most part,  Louis is just like,  hey, I'll be here.  It's like, you know,  how about throwing us  a little funny  something every so  often?  I'm going to tweet  right now.  Oh, you're going to  do that?  Give us something  good right now.  You're going to  tweet something good?  I'm going to tweet  right now.  Jimmy was tweeting  yesterday how he was  flying with old people  and how he was  bossing around old  people on a plane.  Jimmy lets you know  what's going on.  It is weird.  The guys you really  want to be tweeting  and using Twitter  properly just don't.  Just don't.  I don't mind the  plugs.  Believe me, I know  what you guys do.  I love it, whatever. 
[02:20:30]  And I even plug  things like if I'm  allowed to do a  certain thing in my  house, I would plug  it.  But, you know, I also  like basic conversation.  I like when someone  tweets, Andy Levy is  great with that shit.  Andy Levy is a great  tweeter.  What is he on Twitter?  Andy Levy?  Yeah.  I think he just has  Andy Levy.  He's a really good one.  He's on Red Eye, which  by the way, if you tune  into Red Eye next  Thursday, you will see  Anthony Cumia on Red Eye.  You're doing it?  Yeah, I've done it for  quite a while now, Joe. 
[02:21:00]  Dude, I love doing  really.  No, I didn't mean it  like that.  Yeah.  Wait a minute.  I think I might be on  next Thursday.  If you're on Thursday,  I'm on Monday.  I'm on Monday.  Joe and I are  in comedy.  What are you tweeting  for everybody?  I tweeted, Opie and  Anthony told me I need  to tweet more, so  here.  Oh, you suck.  That's at least  something.  Look, let's spend  New Year's Eve  together.  Oh, let's see what  else he goes.  Oh, wait a minute.  You did write  something.  I'm sick and I'm  watching Love Actually. 
[02:21:30]  I think my hormones  are trying to tell  me something.  There you go.  You see?  Okay, sick tweets.  You know, maybe I  fucking convicted you.  I wrongly fucking  accused you here.  What you're not  reading is the fine  print that these  tweets are two  months apart.  I see.  Oh, oh.  Tonight, righteous  kill, right?  It's Saturday.  Is it Saturday or  Sunday?  You got to tweet  more, Joe.  No, but he, okay,  all right.  I still like doing it.  You're not as bad  as I thought you  were.  Maybe I just  ignore everything  but your plugs.  Look at that nice 
[02:22:00]  tweet.  My album made  top ten albums  of the year.  Oh, that's  pretty cool.  Oh.  Hey, isn't it odd  that we're all up  for these Twitter  awards, these  Shorty Awards?  Are we?  Yes.  Oh.  Everyone's  nominating us  for these Shorty  Awards.  What are Shorty  Awards?  I don't know.  It's some kind  of Twitter thing,  but I'm nominated  for journalism  and for politics.  You know, they  nominated, I did  see that, actually.  E-Rock was  nominated for food,  I swear to God.  It's a food category, 
[02:22:30]  I swear to God.  It hasn't stopped.  I swear to God.  It's called the  Shorty Awards, and  I do appreciate  everyone legitimately  nominating us  for stuff.  It's kind of funny.  Jimmy's in there  for books, by the  way, for authors.  There's E-Rock.  Tenth place in the  food category?  I was fourth  before.  What happened?  Fuck, we better  move up E-Rock  Radio, right?  Get E-Rock Radio  up there.  You used to be  number one in  politics, too.  Yeah, I was in  there in politics,  too.  And one guy said  he nominates me  for politics because  I teach him a lot  about Hitler and 
[02:23:00]  the end people.  So I guess the  Shorty Awards are  a complete joke,  right?  I guess so.  Hey, we got  Troy.  Didn't Dave win  one last one?  No, no.  Dave was nominated  and lost.  He lost to somebody  who was pretending  to be a llama.  And lost his  fucking mind on  stage at the  presentation.  Live on CNN.  Not live on CNN.  It was classic  fucking Eastside Dave.  And he's upset  because he's  trying to win  the weird category  now.  And people are  voting all of us  for these stupid  categories, but not 
[02:23:30]  voting for Dave  in the weird category.  But you know why?  Because unfortunately  Dave isn't on the  show.  He would run away  with it.  What is he,  third for the  weird category?  Oh, that's good.  Dave, uh,  David McDonald.  Um, Eastside Dave.  Vote for him  in the weird category.  He's beating out  the llama.  Yeah, he's beating  out the llama.  I don't even know  what these awards,  what are these awards?  It's just horseshit.  It's for Twitter.  It's Twitter.  I want to be  nominated.  Joe DeRosa for  plugs.  Yeah.  Just fucking  plugging gigs.  Can I be nominated  for plugs?  What else can I be  nominated for? 
[02:24:00]  Worst Twitterer.  Worst Twitterer?  Uh, oh, here's the  categories.  Let's get a category  for you, Joe.  How about marketing?  You look like a  marketing.  That would be good.  You look like a  green guy.  Green.  So not at all.  The shit I get  whenever people come  over to my place,  like for drinks or  something, and they're  like, where do we put  our beer cans?  I'm like, in the  fucking trash.  In the garbage.  You don't recycle?  No.  I don't give a shit.  It's garbage.  It'll end up in a  landfill.  I don't give a shit.  How about innovation? 
[02:24:30]  I want to be  nominated for that.  Innovation?  That sounds good.  Joe DeRosa.  Anthony, breaking news.  We got Tom in  Madison, Wisconsin,  who's going to talk  for everybody.  Go ahead, Tom.  I think Kenny is the  fucking best phone  screener in the world.  I tell you.  Anyway, if indeed  that was him, I can  only envision a giant  body with a little  hat, but what are  the numbers, guys?  Less than 10% of  adults have Twitter?  Come on.  Get over it.  I'm dying out here.  You're funnier than 
[02:25:00]  hell.  I like you.  Twitter?  Yeah, push these  ideas.  Twitter and Twitter  and...  Wow, you are all  over the place.  Yeah, Twitter and  Facebook is a nice  little side thing that  if you like the show,  it's kind of fun to  do.  It is.  We're talking to way  more people right now  than I'll ever talk to  on Twitter.  And believe me, the  demographic of people  that he's talking  about, he's talking  about everyone overall  that uses Twitter is  only a fraction of  the people, but if  you're talking about  our audience, a lot  of them are using  Twitter.  But the thing with 
[02:25:30]  Twitter, with this  social networking, now  it's being hooked up to  the Facebook and  everything else, so it's  kind of just becoming  fucking huge.  The bottom of every  news story has a  Twitter thing if you  want to Twitter the  news story or fucking  link it to something.  I like that it keeps  the show going pretty  much 24-7.  That guy was a fucking  retard.  That's all right.  Most of the people  listening to this right  now don't have Twitter.  That's true.  But the ones that do  and they follow us,  they have a pretty  good time with it.  I think it's a larger  percentage than the  overall population. 
[02:26:00]  What bothers me about  our audience is kind  of in there.  What did Troy Quongo?  He thought he was  off the hook?  Yeah, I think he did.  Oh, I thought you  left the room.  And why do you look  so fucking mean?  No, whenever you're  ready for him.  Wow, did he give you  a look, Opie?  Yeah, you look  Holy fuck.  He was sitting on the  chair and you would  just say something.  Yeah, I'm here.  I'm here, motherfucker.  Here's Troy Quongo.  Yeah, whenever you're  ready for him,  just hanging out.  So Troy, you had a  lot of questions.  You've had a rough  week with the  Opie and Anthony  show because you're  kind of a conspiracy  guy.  No, not a conspiracy  guy.  But you like to  question things.  Sure.  Michio Kaku 
[02:26:30]  explained a lot of  things today.  Are you okay with  his explanations or  do you feel like we  should dig further  into the dead birds,  the dead fish, and  whatnot?  Yeah, well, I mean,  Michio Kaku is the  end-all be-all, so  we should just  believe what he  says because he  wrote a book.  Well, he wrote a  book, and he's a  doctor.  He's a physicist.  He's a physicist.  Yes.  So whatever he says  has got to be the  truth, right?  More so, I think,  than some dumb  fucking college 
[02:27:00]  puke that thinks  there's a conspiracy  to everything and  says the birds fell  out of the sky  because of a  satellite array in  Alaska.  Alaska.  I feel like  neither of you  really mean what  you're saying right  now.  I feel like you're  both being very  sarcastic.  I think Troy's  being very sarcastic.  Wouldn't it be  weird if it was  sound sarcastic but  isn't conversation?  We're like, oh,  yeah, we should just  believe everything he  says, and he means  it.  Well, we're sarcastic  sounding guy.  You know, you 
[02:27:30]  meant what you said.  You were calling him  a college puke,  right?  Yeah.  Because that's  what's happening.  No, no, not you.  I was just saying  these people that...  Oh, sorry.  I thought you were  calling him a college puke.  Not him personally.  Oh, sorry.  I just mean the  people that like  saying everything's a  conspiracy or something.  And with the birds  thing, it was one  species of bird.  That's why...  Yeah.  I mean, if it was  something else, there  would have been many  different species  fucking dead all over  the road.  So it makes it more  logical that something  happened within the  flock.  Right.  Right.  Yeah.  I guess.  Because there's other  birds in the sky, isn't  there?  Sure. 
[02:28:00]  You still want to  believe that the chemtrails  did it, though.  No, I never said the  chemtrails did it.  No, you said you saw  the chemtrails and then  a couple of days later  the birds are dead.  So you went, ah, just  saying.  No, this is what I  said.  I was in Arkansas.  I was driving through.  I saw a massive amount  of chemtrails.  And I tweeted a joke.  Yes.  And then a couple  days later, birds are  falling out of the sky.  It's a conspiracy.  Spiracy.  Spiracy.  That's what I said.  I'm not here trying to 
[02:28:30]  convince you of chemtrails  doing it.  But did you like what  Michi Kaku had to say?  I don't believe in  chemtrails.  Or you don't buy into  his horse shit.  He's explained 2012 to  us.  Dude.  He's explained the  Twin Towers thing very  well.  There's nothing that  anybody could say that's  going to change my  beliefs.  What's your belief?  What's a healthy way  to live?  Well, I'm just.  I believe that the  mainstream media is  corrupt.  Yes. 
[02:29:00]  And they are.  They'll they'll they're  lying to us.  I believe.  I believe.  It's a conspiracy.  Spiracy.  So.  So I'm just a regular  fucking dude going about  my day, trying to live  my life, doing the best I  can with what I have.  And like a Springsteen  song.  I'm just a regular dude  going through my day,  trying to get through  life with the things I  got.  It's just me and  Wendy listening to the 
[02:29:30]  corrupt news, Wendy.  These chemtrails.  Chemtrails over Jersey.  There's chemtrails over  Jersey.  Well, we went down to  the beach and the  boardwalk was full  of aliens.  And I didn't know what  to do.  What about the black  birds, Bruce?  Black birds dropping  from the sky over Jersey.  I was driving down the  parkway and me and  Wendy saw black birds  dying. 
[02:30:00]  Hit it, Calvin.  Calvin, go.  I'm just a regular guy  trying to make my way  through life with a  corrupt press.  Well, and by corrupt  press, I mean Jews, but  I don't want to say  Jews.  You think Michu Kaku is 
[02:30:30]  working for the man,  Troy?  I mean, if scientists  are developing weather  cause there's aluminum  in the air over Jersey.  Somebody's putting  fluoride in the  drinking water again.  As fluoride goes  into my mouth.  It led to the towers  being an inside job.  Well, I didn't see a  plane at the Pentagon. 
[02:31:00]  There wasn't an engine  and everyone was gone.  We can find 500  planets, but we can't  find Bin Laden.  Something's wrong,  people.  And where'd that  passport come from,  Wendy?  Latroy happens.  I'm sorry.  Latroy, yeah.  I don't need to try to  convince you guys of  anything.  I mean, whatever.  You guys believe  whatever you want to  believe.  I don't care.  I really don't.  Whatever you guys 
[02:31:30]  want to believe.  Whatever helps you  sleep at night,  believe it.  It doesn't help me  sleep at night.  It doesn't keep me  up at night.  I don't think about it  as much.  I don't take everything  at face value,  but for the most part,  the path of least  resistance is probably  what happened.  There you go.  For the majority  of things.  You don't have to  think that everything  had to be this plot  and everything is being  covered up.  And I don't.  And there's this grand  plan.  But you kind of do  because you're  questioning everything.  Sometimes things are 
[02:32:00]  just what they are.  Well, there you go.  You convinced me of  it.  I believe this.  Because there you  are.  You're convincing.  I believe there's  some sneaky shit  going on, but not to  the extent you think.  Of course not.  And my issue with  you, Troy, is that  you have questions  with no substance  behind it.  And I keep encouraging  you to come up with  some substance.  What do you want  substance of?  I mean, like what  killed the birds?  Let's go right back to  what started this whole  thing with you.  I don't know.  I have no idea.  But I'm sure you've  been doing your  research, no?  Well, I know what  you know.  But did you do 
[02:32:30]  research and you  found some websites  that are questionable  and what are they  saying?  Thermite paint!  They're saying  fireworks and  lightning.  But you're not  believing that.  Well, who cares  what I believe?  What do you care  what I believe?  It's out of  curiosity.  No, but I mean  seriously, who gives  a shit?  You know what I  mean?  Because it's another  point of view.  That's why.  That's what we do  on this show.  That's why.  It's what people do  in life.  Kind of trade ideas.  Trade ideas.  Ever since caveman.  Asshole for  thinking what  you're thinking  and he goes,  oh yeah, well  you're a fucking  asshole for  thinking what  you're thinking.  Someone drew  something on a 
[02:33:00]  cave wall and  someone pointed  at it and said  that's bullshit.  And every once  in a while maybe  you learn something  from somebody else  and you exchange  a little info.  That's all.  That's why I care.  I mean, I haven't  done too much.  I know what you  know just by  looking through  what has been  printed online.  See, I'm not  suspicious because  it was one  species.  Right.  Because there's a  lot of birds in  the sky all the  time.  So if it was some  poisoning or some  fucking weapon  or something  They were working  on a poison  though that just  takes out one  type of person  and believe me  blackbirds? 
[02:33:30]  Enough said.  Enough said.  That's step one.  We all know  they can't be  leaders, right  Anthony?  I understand  what they're doing.  No, but you  know, I like the  lightning theory but  then that would have  fucked up what I  just said to Troy  that other species  would have fucking  fallen from the sky  if it was lightning.  But fucking  Michukaku with that  explanation.  The lead bird  fucked up and  everyone had to do  a mass suicide  because of it.  That makes perfect  sense to me.  I mean, that's  biologically that  makes sense.  Their leader goes  down, the birds  think they're  supposed to go  down.  They're not 
[02:34:00]  smart.  You see that  flock of birds  and you see  them flying and  they all turn  and they know  where to go and  they're all  following each  other?  Yeah.  Who's to say  one of them  doesn't fly into  the ground and  they all kind of  follow or enough  of them until one  of them goes,  hey, fuck this.  Well, isn't that  what happens with  the whales?  One stupid whale  thinks he knows  what he's doing  and they all  follow the dumb  whale?  People do that  for Christ's  sakes.  Yeah, people do  that.  A mob of people  being led by  somebody will all  commit the same  prime example.  Crosswalk.  When it's a 
[02:34:30]  don't walk but  one guy says  I can make it  and he goes  and he can make  it, someone else  will just step  off the curb  and follow them.  How about when  the guy blindly  follows his GPS  onto the train  tracks or something?  Yeah, that's  another great one.  I love when  every once in a  while you get to  drive on the  water if you  have GPS.  That's always fun.  Oh yeah, when  you're driving  and you look down  at your GPS  and you're like  wow, I'm in  the middle of  the water now.  I'm in the  East River, this  is great.  What happened?  Hey, someone's  doing Hawk today.  Hey, what the  fuck? 
[02:35:00]  She's very excited  about the snow,  you guys.  Let's talk about  it.  Someone just  did Hawk.  Someone totally  did Hawk.  Wait, what is  that about?  Some broad,  they're doing  some live dumb  thing about the  weather and some  girl ran up from  behind with her  arms and ears  just like we were  talking about with  Hawk.  That's weird.  Could someone find  out if that had  anything to do  with anything?  I'm not going  to be.  It's hilarious.  I love the  immaturity of just  fucking up a live  broadcast like that  and the guy's got  to go, well, she's  very excited about  the snow.  Troy, you just  need more substance  behind what you're 
[02:35:30]  thinking.  That's all.  That's fine.  That's all.  And that's why I  do care.  All right, dude.  I learn a lot on  this show.  A shitload.  And I also like  calling people out  on being whatever.  Well, that's the  thing with conspiracy  theories too is that  what you were saying  about path of  least resistance is  probably what  happened.  And I'm not  against a conspiracy  theory, but a lot  of times conspiracy  theories go against  science.  You know, for  instance, like with  medicine, a doctor  will tell you, you  know, where you say,  well, could I  contract a sickness  this way? 
[02:36:00]  This might have  happened.  This might have  happened.  The first thing  a doctor will say  is you're dealing  with a lot of  maybes right now.  You need to deal  with definites.  What definitely  happened?  And then you know  if you were exposed  possibly to something.  You know what I  mean?  And that's with  conspiracy theories,  same thing.  It's like, well, if  this happened and  then that would  allow for this  tentatively to  happen and  theoretically then  this could hinge  on that.  You get down the  line with this  mousetrap scenario  where it's like you  can't.  Right.  It's just not  likely.  There's so many  weird maybes and  things that are so 
[02:36:30]  hard to happen that  the easier things  just, it's easier  that it happened  that way.  That's all.  That's usually my  take on it.  Believe me, I think  there are shenanigans  going on all the  time.  All the time.  But they get  exposed because  people are stupid.  People talk.  And when someone  tries to cover  something up, it  gets exposed.  That's the thing  too.  Somebody way up the  top of the government  ladder that's going  to orchestrate  some sort of  thing that justifies  the conspiracy  theory. 
[02:37:00]  He's no less of a  half-ass than the  average person.  That guy's sitting  there too going,  this is going to  be a fucking  headache.  Are you shitting  me?  A prime example  is look at  fucking Watergate  and Nixon.  Yeah.  Everyone tried to  cover that shit up  but people opened  their mouths.  They left evidence.  And that was like a  huge cover-up.  They tried their best.  They really wanted.  At the top end of  the government, they  tried to cover that  shit up and  couldn't fucking do  it.  Yeah.  They can't keep the  spoilers for the new  Spider-Man movie  secret. 
[02:37:30]  You know?  Yeah.  That's me.  It's not the whole  deal that conspiracies  can't happen  logistically or  technically, but it's  that dumb-ass  fucking human element  that makes me doubt  that conspiracies are  so deep-rooted.  You don't think that  there has been  cover-ups about  what is going on  in our food?  What is going on  with flu shots?  They get exposed.  Do they?  I mean, you know.  Irradiated food. 
[02:38:00]  You mean things like  that?  Hold on.  He said, do they?  Came out today.  Yeah, the vaccinations.  Yeah, I got it.  No, no, no.  But no one knows.  Study linking  vaccinations to  autism called fraudulent.  And that was something  that people started  buying into saying,  holy shit, kids are  getting autism  because of the  vaccination.  Yeah.  Okay.  So what I'm saying  is...  And they're now  proving that was  bullshit.  When you watch the  news, they tell you,  oh, it's flu season.  Go get your flu shots.  So guess what  everybody does?  They go, okay,  let's go get our  flu shots.  Got to go down  and do it. 
[02:38:30]  And then it's like,  what are you injecting  me with?  It's a  conspiracy.  The guy's trying  to make a point  and you just shit  on it with that  production.  No, I thought  it was the end  of the point.  It's the end  of the point.  You guys are  nominating the flu.  No, no, no.  Try it.  I'm sorry.  Try it.  Try it.  No, no, it's the  end of the point.  God forbid we try  to make people laugh.  You guys are  nominating for a  journalism award.  That's right.  You're trying for  our journalism shorty.  So people march down  to get their flu shot  and...  So they walk down,  they just go,  they go here, 
[02:39:00]  they don't even know  where they're going.  They just walk in.  They're like, hey,  inject me with  whatever you got.  All right.  Boom.  Inject you.  All right, Troy,  now let me ask you.  Go ahead.  What makes more sense  that they're getting  something that was  worked on in a lab  to stop them  from getting the flu  or that it's some  deep-seated evilness  that they're injecting  in them?  What makes more sense?  Or, can I add  something to that?  Yes, please.  Instead of going,  hey, this was designed  in a laboratory,  how about I try to do  something natural  to avoid getting the flu? 
[02:39:30]  I don't want to be  injected with whatever  it is.  I don't care what  they made it.  There is something  natural.  It's called getting  the flu.  And then you become  immune to that strain.  It's called exercising.  It's called eating healthy.  It's called taking  your vitamins and living  a healthy lifestyle.  And you can avoid  the flu.  So what's wrong  with saying,  no one,  I don't want to go  do that.  There's nothing wrong  with saying that.  You could still get  a virus,  a viral flu.  Say I don't want  to get injected  from what they're giving me.  Getting your immune  system up is a very  healthy thing.  You're right.  Two things.  First of all,  you sound like Hulk Hogan  there,  which is nice  with the vitamins 
[02:40:00]  and stuff.  Take your vitamins,  brother.  And the other thing  is,  why would the government  make it so complicated  like talking and  getting flu shots  when the government  could possibly open  up their own burger  joint and have the  fucking poisons  in the burgers?  What are you saying,  Opie?  It would be a lot  easier to do it that way.  There are points  in burgers.  Here's the thing.  Here's the thing.  They can make it a lot  easier instead of complicated  where they have to talk  you into actually  getting a shot.  Here's the thing.  For the flu.  Put it in the water.  They could easily  just set up some joints  that they know 
[02:40:30]  this burger joint  is bad news  so the people  they don't want  to get the poison  certainly know  that don't go  to fucking  this burger joint.  How do you know  when you drink  bottled water  there isn't shit  in this?  Exactly.  I was being sarcastic.  You don't want  to go down that road  because nobody  is regulating  what this is.  By the way,  though,  by the way,  for these theories  about poison flu shots  or government fluoride  in the water  or whatever it is,  there are easy solutions  to these things.  The government  could make flu shots 
[02:41:00]  mandatory very easily,  make them mandatory,  especially now  with the new  health care bill  being passed.  Yeah.  The government  can easily fluoride up  all the bottled water  if they wanted to.  If they really wanted to,  people could avoid  tap water  and they could get  their fluoride  in a different way.  And also,  this is what kills me.  Nobody ever takes  into account  the psychological aspect  of this.  People say,  well,  these foods  are loaded  with poisons  and therefore  we're all getting  more sick  because of them.  Well, 
[02:41:30]  maybe we're all  getting more sick  because that's  in our heads  right now  and the holistic  aspect of that  has us all thinking,  I'm going to get sick,  I'm going to get sick,  I'm going to get sick  and that can make you sick.  Psychosomatic?  Well,  not psychosomatic.  Medicine will tell you  that if you have,  if your body  has a propensity  to be subject  to a certain ailment,  for instance,  like a heart attack  or something like that,  and you get yourself  worked up,  you can literally  give yourself  a heart attack,  not a fake heart attack, 
[02:42:00]  you can make yourself  have a heart attack.  Right.  So,  my point is,  is that...  Can you prove that?  No,  I can't.  How do you work  through that?  No meaning...  My friend's got a heart...  Try,  try to make that happen.  Oh,  come on,  man.  I'm on a roll here.  it's not just against you.  But like the point...  You beat everyone up  in this room.  The point is,  is if this stuff  is so bad for you,  well then,  how come everybody  before this generation  or this current society  that we're living in now  was fine?  Was fine.  My dad ate 
[02:42:30]  whatever he wanted  his whole life.  He's still alive.  He's still kicking.  He's still fine.  Never had a goddamn worry  about eating too much red meat  or too much pizza  or too much McDonald's.  But on average,  the life expectancy  has gone up over the years.  What do you mean he's fine?  He's still alive?  He's totally alive.  He's perfectly healthy.  He's 65 years old.  64.  It happens at 74.  74 is the age.  But my point is,  they'll make you think now  that the government  is injecting  every cheeseburger  with AIDS.  And if you eat one, 
[02:43:00]  you'll be dead  at 15 years old.  It's like...  Got any AIDS burgers  back there?  It's not AIDS,  but there's preservatives  in it.  There is...  They give the cows  hormones.  Yeah.  So there's a whole  string of things  that they're doing  to food now  that they weren't doing  in your father's generation.  It might just be  irresponsibility.  They're doing that  to have better food  and don't realize...  You ever see a chicken breast now?  There is some after effects.  Love it.  If you're putting hormones...  You ever see what cows  look like that are  pumped full of hormones?  Oh, delicious is how they look.  It's disgusting. 
[02:43:30]  You know, and if you...  They've got beautiful bodies.  You know what an old steak  used to taste like?  Shit.  And I love steak, dude.  That fucking sucks.  A lot of grizzle.  A lot of grizzle.  Now it's just this  nice, plump, juicy steak.  It's like,  who cares what they're  doing with hormones?  Right now?  Have they shown...  And life expectancy  is greater than  it's ever been  in this country.  So what problem is that?  They radiated food.  They're making more food.  Not as much waste.  Corn is great.  You ever see a fucking  era corn now 
[02:44:00]  compared to what it was  like years ago?  It's better to eat natural.  It looked like that fake corn  you hung on your fucking door  on Halloween.  And now it's golden  fucking golden nuggets  on a buttery nice corn cob.  It literally looks like popcorn  before you pop it.  Do you know corn cobs  these days look beautiful?  If you showed a today corn cob  to a guy 50 years ago  you'd go,  what the fuck is that?  It's beautiful.  Because it's genetically altered.  I'm jumping G-Hosie fat.  Whatever. 
[02:44:30]  You're genetically  altering this shit.  Yeah.  So just because it looks good  doesn't mean it's healthy  for you though.  You never know.  You don't know.  You don't know if it's unhealthy.  I'm just saying that  people are getting sicker now  from food than they ever have.  And it's giving  9-year-old girls tits.  I don't think it's  necessarily unhealthy.  And there is no better example  than fear versus consumption  than everything going on  with the health craze.  They tell you  you can't eat anything  except lettuce  and boiled chicken  or else you're going to die.  And then you go to buy  a salad with boiled chicken 
[02:45:00]  on top of it  and it's $14  for iceberg lettuce  with shit  fucking processed chicken  on top.  Go to Cozy.  These fucking morons  that go  Wendy's is bad for you.  We need to eat it Cozy.  Really?  What are you going to eat?  You're going to eat  a chicken Caesar salad sandwich  you fat fuck?  Like that's any better for you?  With that processed  fucking Oscar Mayer chicken  that they dump in there  and that Paul Newman  creamy Caesar salad dressing.  Yeah.  No that's way healthier  than a Baconator.  Go fucking eat it.  Enjoy it. 
[02:45:30]  All right.  Well let's  we should take a break.  Yeah you got me all worked up.  I know right?  Honestly it's a good work up.  Don't get worked up.  It's unhealthy.  I liked listening to Joe DeRozan.  Yeah.  Fez gave himself a heart attack  so you're onto something.  Yeah he certainly did.  My friend's wife  has a heart condition.  She had two heart attacks  last year  and she almost had another one.  She had the symptoms  and the doctors were like  you  they were like  you were working out  you started to feel  a little lightheaded  and they go dude  if you start focusing on that 
[02:46:00]  you can literally  give yourself another heart attack.  Yeah it's fucked up.  Or if that's true  why can't you give yourself abs?  I don't know.  I've been trying.  Can you think yourself  into being in shape?  Why is it only  thinking yourself  into being safe?  I can't even think  that hard about abs.  All right.  It's a little I care.  Joe DeRozan  killing for us today.  We appreciate that.  Troy Kwan  thank you so much.  Yes Troy.  Troy's had a rough week.  I can tell.  Troy is  he's going to drink  this weekend.  He's got a rough week.  That's cool.  Yeah. 
[02:46:30]  I'm stoked to be  part of your guys show.  You're representing  some people out there.  That's what this damn thing is about.  I understand  but I just  we all represent  people out there.  I'm not  I'm from very different  walks of life here.  Conspiracy theorists  have an agenda  to push their agenda on you  and I have no desire  to push my agenda  on anybody.  I have no agenda.  That's why  I set up what you say  with  he has questions.  I'm not necessarily  saying you're a conspiracy guy.  And I'm not saying  that everything  that those guys say 
[02:47:00]  is the gospel truth  the conspiracy guys  but you know  sometimes they say  interesting things.  Sometimes Dr. Kaku  makes an interesting point.  Interesting point.  All right.  Thank you Troy Kwan.  Dr. Kaku.  Thank you.  Here goes Troy.  You know what  we might  it's all right Troy  I had a good week  I swear.  There he goes.  It's a  Kwan  Spiracy  Spiracy  He is pissed.  I know he is.  You can see it in his eyes.  He's an angry dude.  He's going to fuck someone up.  Oh please.  I just hope it's not me. 
[02:47:30]  Listen we're going to  come back  and I think we're going to  I think we're going to go  hoarders.  Unless Joe has something.  I love fucking hoarders.  What do you want to talk about?  Is that that fat fucking bitch?  Whatever you guys want to do.  The one you talked about  earlier this week.  We got a fucking hit on that.  I want to  Oh good.  And also the season finale  of Hoarders is coming up.  Sweet.  Yes and it is a woozy.  And a thought  A woozy?  A woo-loo-loo.  A doozy?  Or a doozy?  I was watching Intervention  I'm woozy.  And I was watching Intervention  one of your favorite shows.  Yeah.  So it was on  Hot Crack Whore?  What episode? 
[02:48:00]  It was  yeah with the blonde?  Hot meth head?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah yeah yeah.  With the lunatic boyfriend?  Right.  Saying look you're just going to be  back out on the street  You're a whore  and she smacks him.  Dumb bitch.  So the premise is  they're doing a documentary  on addicts.  On drug addicts.  I know they're drug addicts  but not one of these dummies  can't figure out  that it's actually  for intervention?  I was just saying that.  You were?  Yeah.  As I'm watching it  they always go to this hotel room  not knowing that like  their family's going to be in there.  I want to see all the footage 
[02:48:30]  of the people that went  Fuck you.  I know this is for intervention  you idiot.  I watched the show.  I ain't going.  And the answer would be  well they're drug addicts  so they're not thinking clearly.  Really?  Every single one thinks  it's a documentary on addicts  or addiction.  They are fucked up on drugs.  You watch Celebrity Rehab?  I watched  What are you looking at, Danny?  This is  What?  All I saw is Junior Prom.  Let me tell you what  The what?  Let me tell you what you need to do.  Anthony, what?  Anthony. 
[02:49:00]  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  What's the baby show you watch?  Little Miss Perfect?  I like  Whatever it's called.  I like Little Miss Perfect  better than Toddlers in Tiaras.  What were you saying?  Exactly.  What is it?  I like Little Miss Perfect  is better than Toddlers in Tiaras.  So this is what you do.  You watch Little Miss Perfect.  Yeah.  Then you seg into  Intervention.  Intervention.  And then you move on  to Celebrity Rehab.  Okay.  And you finish up  I don't like Celebrity Rehab.  And you finish up your night  with Dance with the Stars.  I like Hoarders.  It's an arc. 
[02:49:30]  Hoarders.  It's an arc.  Of what happens in real life.  Where do you fit Hoarders in?  That's a good point.  Hoarders.  I don't know where you fit Hoarders.  That might be another arc we start.  At the end.  I feel like Hoarders  is a whole other day.  That's what I'm saying.  That's a whole other ballpark.  Yeah, yeah.  But if you seg from  all the shows I mentioned  it all kind of makes sense.  The Little Miss Perfect people  are fucked up  so they move into  fucking doing drugs  then you got to do  their intervention thing.  No, how about 16 and Pregnant?  16 and Pregnant?  Is after Little Miss Perfect.  Then 16 and Pregnant.  Wait, so how does it go now?  Little Miss Perfect.  Little Miss Perfect. 
[02:50:00]  Where do the drugs come in?  After 16 and Pregnant, yeah.  So you go Little Miss Perfect  then it moves nicely  into 16 and Pregnant.  16 and Pregnant.  Okay, I gotcha.  Then you go into Intervention.  Intervention, yeah.  Because now they're  fucking drug addicts  because they're horrible lies  between the beauty pageants  and squeezing something  out of their young twats.  Right.  So then you go Intervention.  Nah, yeah.  The Intervention happens.  Now you got to get  into some rehab.  Rehab.  So you go Celebrity Rehab.  Celebrity Rehab.  And what do we do  after Celebrity Rehab? 
[02:50:30]  Dance with the Star.  I thought that was  a perfect dance.  Then a fun one  because you're all  rehabbed out  but then you crash  into Hoarders  and you end up  a loner in your house.  No, Hoarders,  I agree with Joe.  That's Tuesday night programming.  So we need an arc  that includes Hoarders.  Hoarders is a tough one  because it's so...  But what would be  the show before Hoarders?  That's what I'm saying.  It's tough.  Or does it start with Hoarders?  It's so oddly psychotic.  Like, I don't even know...  If they had a show  about people that were OCD  and germaphobes and shit, 
[02:51:00]  that would be  what you follow Hoarders with  because they clean up  and then they go  in the other direction  off the deep end.  But they don't have that.  Like, I don't even know  what you would couple  with Hoarders.  It's so odd.  Well, Hoarders is somebody  that, like, kind of...  You know what?  Later in life that fucked  and...  We'll go to break  and this is great  because after the break  someone on this fucking phone  is going to have the answer  of the Hoarders arc.  All right.  Where all the programming  makes sense.  Yes.  I think...  Because I know they did  one season  but I haven't seen it  back for a second  so I'm thinking  maybe it's not around anymore  but there was a show  called Obsessed. 
[02:51:30]  Obsessed.  It was all about OCD people  and I actually had to tap out of it.  Like, I couldn't watch  the episode anymore.  Oh, they did have a show  about that.  I couldn't.  So you go Obsessed  into Hoarders?  Yeah.  I think so.  No, I would go Hoarders  into Obsessed.  Do you think Obsessed  is actually, like,  crazier people  than the Hoarders?  Well, only...  Here's why  because Hoarders is...  Hoarders is, like,  the intervention  for messy people  or whatever you want to call it.  Messy people.  So they clean them up  and then they go off  the shithouse  deep end  in the other direction.  That's my point.  Obsessed...  If you're already 
[02:52:00]  a fucking germaphobe  neat freak  you would never collapse  into Hoarders.  But if you're a Hoarder  you could transition  into the other thing.  Does that make sense?  I got you.  I got it.  Antique Roadshow.  Oh, shit.  Then we need  a bridge to Hoarders.  Pickers.  Pickers is...  That might be  a little too similar.  We're smarter than these people.  We're smarter than this.  Antique, that's a good call, dude.  Or you go...  Or you do the picking  and then you take  your horse shit  to Antique Roadshow.  I think you go Hoarders 
[02:52:30]  Antique Roadshow.  No, you go Pickers  Antique Roadshow  because you've got to  pick the shit out first.  You end with Hoarders  because then you're just  stuck in your house  full of shit.  But there's got to be  another one between  Antique Roadshow  and Hoarders.  What if it's Hoarders  then Pickers  then Antique Roadshow?  No, you can't be hoarding  if you haven't picked yet.  You've got to pick.  You always got to pick first.  I think it's Pickers,  Hoarders,  Antique Roadshow.  I think Antique Roadshow  is the redemption.  So even though  you're only bringing  one lousy fucking  dumb clock  from the 17th century  you have a million clocks 
[02:53:00]  in your house  that people don't know about.  Maybe you threw them all away  and that's the one you kept  because you thought  it might be worth something.  And we've got to make  a little back story here.  We're trying to get  Tuesday Night Programming  set here, Joe.  Pawn stars,  they could pawn off  some of their fucking...  Oh, shit.  Yeah, but they wouldn't do that.  But how would they do that?  Because you're a hoarder.  They wouldn't.  But Hoarders is about  getting better.  That's my point.  At the end of Hoarders  you're supposed to...  You ever watch the show?  They never get better.  Yeah, I know.  But sometimes they'll  clean up the house  a little bit.  Storage Wars  where they have  all their shit  in a big storage locker. 
[02:53:30]  There you go.  God, see, all right.  We might go to the phones.  I think the listeners  are going to have to  help us out  with these show arcs.  We call them show arcs.  I like it.  Yeah.  What, you had one, Danny?  No, I was just saying  Storage Wars  is probably a good fit  because first  they have all the shit  and then the shit  has to be somewhere  for a little bit.  And then they can't  afford to keep it.  And then they can sell the shit.  And we need  Wednesday night programming  has to be about  the fucking fat slob.  Ah, fat slob.  You got The Biggest Loser. 
[02:54:00]  You got Cake Boss.  But we gotta like  balance this out  and put it all together.  And I never watch MTV  but it was on in my house  and I saw some show  called I Used to Be Fat.  I Used to Be Fat.  And it's just...  That could be after  fucking Biggest Loser.  It's just these fat teenage girls.  It's just bouncing around.  It's hysterical.  Disgusting slobs.  And they're all proud  of themselves  because they lost  like 20 pounds  but they still need  to lose another 40.  Ryan in Calgary.  You got Pickers.  My Strange Addiction.  Storage Wars Hoarders. 
[02:54:30]  Oh wait, say it again.  Sorry.  Pickers.  Pickers.  My Strange Addiction  because now you're  picking through garbage  to find that dumb thing.  Storage Wars  because now you gotta  store the shit  and then your storage area  gets overcome  so now you become  a complete hoarder.  Now you gotta go  hoarders to storage area  because storage would  come after.  It's like your house  is full of shit  so you gotta get  storage space now.  That's true.  That's gotta come after.  I want the arc  that ends with  First 48.  Well, we could do  that arc too.  So we could do  a criminal one,  a fat one, 
[02:55:00]  a 40 one.  Are we there yet?  Right.  Are we there yet?  A me, me, me night.  First 48.  Meet the Browns.  You know how they had  must watch TV or whatever?  First 48 cold case file.  Must watch TV?  Yeah.  Must see TV.  Must see TV, sorry.  I would have a  me, me, me night.  I like it.  Me, me.  It's all about these  fucking me, me, me's  out there.  I think we figured out  the hoarder's arc.  I think we can move  on to the next one.  Wait, what is it now?  I think it's, 
[02:55:30]  that guy had it  except I would flip  hoarders with storage wars.  So you'd go pickers.  Uh-huh.  So I gotta fix this up here.  My Strange Addiction,  hoarders, storage wars.  Yeah, then Antique Roadshow.  Just as a nice little  at the end.  I hate it.  Maybe they fixed it.  I like it now.  I kinda like it.  Where's the part  where someone's dead?  Yeah.  We gotta have that.  Yeah.  First 48.  First 48.  No, believe me,  that's a whole 
[02:56:00]  different story though.  I, I, I,  all right, well then  we don't need  the Antique Roadshow.  Just go end it with,  end it on a real  sour note with hoarders.  Yeah.  There's that other show  called like Hoarding  or something.  Yeah, that's not as good.  It's a rip off  but they usually  redeem them at the end.  Yeah, I don't like that one.  Their houses  are never as messy.  It's, it's awesome though  when they show  the disgusting house  and then they do  that camera trick  where it shows  what it transitions into.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  There's still shit on the walls.  Yeah.  That's called a crossfade.  Yeah, yeah.  And the bins. 
[02:56:30]  Yeah, the whole house  is still a shithole  but they're like,  look, I cleaned this  counter off.  Great, you cleaned up.  Good for you.  If that was the first shot  you saw of the house,  you'd still go,  wow, what a shithole.  Yeah.  But since it was  such a shithole.  It is a disgusting,  it's so selfish too,  that fucking.  It is.  They give up everything  their family  and they're crying like,  they took my children  and my family  is the most important thing.  Okay, how about  you throw away this doll?  No!  Then you don't fucking  care about your family,  you dummy.  Yeah.  We'll do the hoarders 
[02:57:00]  when we come by.  I want to hear that fat bitch.  And more show arcs  and let's not just think  about shows happening  right now.  There's reruns  all over the fucking place.  Maybe you squeeze in  an old show  that kind of makes  everything make sense.  Can we make up  new shows that we need?  If we have to, yes.  Okay, all right, all right.  Joe Rose in studio.  We've got to film  the show that's happening  in between the show.  Yeah, well, what do we got?  We got the latest 
[02:57:30]  production piece  from Derek D-Boy.  Wow, he is a production machine.  And we also got  hoarder's clips.  I want to hear  that fat fuck.  Let's do that.  I love how nasty  this woman was.  First, Troy Kwan  had a rough week  with his Troy Spiracies  or Kwan Spiracies  or whatever, right?  Kwan Spiracy.  And then he had  a rap battle with Danny.  Yeah.  And who won?  It was interesting  to say the least.  Oh, wait. 
[02:58:00]  D-Boy's saying  to hold off  if he wants to make  a change real quick.  Oh, wow.  He's a fucking perfectionist.  What a perfectionist.  Let me see if this is old.  Damn it.  Man's an artist.  Man's an artist.  Holy shit.  New year, new motivation.  It really is.  It's unbelievable.  We're all on top  of our games.  So they rap battle?  Wait till March 1st.  It's all going to change?  That's about when  it changes, usually.  Yeah.  We come in here  with the new year  and we're like a blazing, man.  We're right back. 
[02:58:30]  We're a well-oiled machine  all rested.  Just hang on a second.  And the hope comes back.  The hell is hope?  I say it comes back.  Oh.  For a little bit.  Just for a tad.  I'm the opposite.  I usually don't spike up  until about March.  Really?  Yeah, I start out slow, man.  This part of the year  is depressing, man.  It's a fucking cold  and shit, man.  See, that's why  you've got to get into sports  because it doesn't get depressing  until after the Super Bowl.  When's the Super Bowl?  For sports people,  then Super Bowl ends  and then you're like, 
[02:59:00]  oh, fuck.  Now what?  When's the Super Bowl?  February?  February, yeah.  Somewhere in there.  Yeah, I guess that's  something to look forward to.  I get very depressed  when there's...  Then they throw that  Sports Illustrated  swimsuit calendar at you  and that helps you  for about a couple days.  Jesus, there's fucking  pornography up the ass  on the internet.  What am I, 10?  I still like that old school shit  where there's some clothes  on the body.  Really?  I certainly do.  On the body.  I don't, dude.  On the body.  The dead body.  I need to see a fucking  urine stream at this point.  Something. 
[02:59:30]  Really just destroyed  my fucking head, man.  It's terrible.  I'm trying to cut back  on the porn, man, you know,  because I think it fucks up your...  Your sex drive?  Your libido?  It does fuck you up  a little bit, man.  It's like you're releasing  too much steam from the engine.  You don't have that  chook-chook when you need it.  Yeah.  If you're porning and jacking.  I'm way back in the porn,  myself, yeah.  You're way back on it  or back in it?  Way back.  Backing off, I guess.  You're back off.  Backing off.  Yeah.  But that's a cycle, though. 
[03:00:00]  It is.  It is.  It's like drinking, you know?  You have like your  heavy drinking periods  and then you kind of  take it easy for a while  and then you...  You know what I mean?  No.  When does the  take it easy part kick in?  You really looked at  the wrong person  with that one.  Joe's looking right at me.  I'm like, what?  And we'll back off  when he's napping.  That crap...  That crap has no dips.  There's no dynamic  in that one.  Yeah.  My dip is...  Straight line.  My dip is breakfast.  You're drinking better? 
[03:00:30]  Better?  Yeah.  I drink great.  Has it modified?  Have you modified your drinking?  Well, over the holidays  it was just  out of control.  In fucking sanity.  I mean,  every day starting  at probably  one in the afternoon  and it would go until,  you know,  wake up on the couch  with a spilt beer  in my lap.  Pretty much just... 
[03:01:00]  With who?  Or by yourself?  Well, that depends.  Was it...  I mean,  were you having  little festive things  at the house?  Yeah, yeah.  It was like festive things  and yeah,  there were parties,  people over,  just...  And then I was eating  like shit  because the cheese  and crackers are out  and chips and dips  and stuff  because there's parties on  and it was just so...  Oh, God.  That's why...  Now I'm just back  to fucking turkey  and...  What's your favorite cheese?  Let's get into this right now. 
[03:01:30]  Fucking sharp cheddar  is the shit.  Damn it!  Not!  Do you do cheese combos?  You start with a little...  You settle in  with a little Swiss.  I love Swiss.  The big Swiss  that you slice.  Right, right.  And then you go into  a little sharp cheddar  and then you finish it off  with one of those  fucking...  With the spice in it.  The fucking...  I don't like those.  The pepper jack.  The pepper jack.  Pepper jack's pretty good.  Pepper jack's all right  but the Monterey Jack cheese  doesn't have a lot of flavor.  It needs salt.  So you're relying... 
[03:02:00]  Let me...  Can I tell you how I do this?  Can I share these?  Please do.  I got a fucking combo, dude.  And you throw in some blue cheese  to really shock the palate?  Here's how I go.  I go with a...  I go with a Vermont sharp cheddar.  I'm not a white sharp cheddar.  That mild cheddar, why Bob?  Fuck it.  All right.  A sharp cheddar.  I get a fucking hard Parmesan  or an aged provolone.  Something with real bite to it.  That's where I go blue cheese.  And then like a Munster or Swiss.  Something medium in between  that you just kind of balance.  Where do you throw the grapes in? 
[03:02:30]  You know...  A couple grapes in between  some cheese.  That's not bad.  I'll go green grape,  apple slices.  Wine.  You know?  With some wine.  Prosciutto.  Wine, yes.  Prosciutto.  Prosciutto.  Very good there.  With some apple slices.  You ever have a whiz of cheese?  That's really...  Right in the mouth.  Right in the mouth.  What fruit do you eat  with a cheese whiz?  Oh, my God.  Yeah, I got to have  a Jolly Ranchers.  Oh, that's disgusting.  I don't know why  that grossed me out so much.  Cheese whiz.  This was just a stall tactic. 
[03:03:00]  Of course it was.  The change has been made  and now D-Boy has handed in  a perfect production.  In his eyes,  it's perfect.  Perfection.  On an all-new  Butt Files,  homosexual sci-fi  investigative couple  Muldouche and Sally  argue the authenticity  of a mysterious  pornographic take.  Why are you being  so confrontational?  Because I didn't tell you  to watch shit.  You implied it.  Saying, well, hey,  you didn't watch this yet.  When you watch this,  you're going to be blown away.  When did I tell you  to watch it?  I said I found it interesting.  Dude, why are you  being like this now? 
[03:03:30]  We're just talking about this.  Wow, Mr. Passion over here.  But the couple soon finds  their homoerotic partnership  spiraling out of control.  Don't touch me.  I don't want you to touch me.  Oh, my God.  I don't want you to touch me.  I don't want you.  Who the fuck  are you going to be  touching me?  I'm trying to talk to you.  You don't have to touch me.  You can talk to me  and not touch me.  Find out if the two lovers  will find the transgendered  individuals responsible  for their dilemma.  You're like, oh,  I'm telling you to watch this.  I didn't tell you to watch it.  You're making shit up.  Why are you so hung up  on this porn?  Why are you so mad at me today?  Because every time I come in here  and I say something  that you don't like,  this is what you do.  Here, ready? 
[03:04:00]  All on the next  Butt Files.  Butt Files.  Why does it always  have to be gay on this show?  Oh, it's always very gay.  Extreme gay.  That's what we do.  I don't appreciate the lies  that are in there.  You could sue.  Go to Human Resources.  I would.  I would love a relationship  with Troy,  but he won't have me.  Oh, that's sad.  I think you guys  are going to get along eventually.  I got along with Troy.  I'm not even making a joke.  I got along with Troy.  I got to ask you a question.  Who's screening the phone? 
[03:04:30]  Well, Kenny was for a while.  Who's on there right now?  Troy, but he's coming in.  Troy.  Oh, shit.  Not Troy again.  He's fucking...  I really have to ask you.  I really got to ask you  about this one.  Yes.  Now, this is something  that was brought up  before the show.  My spelling's atrocious.  No, no, not spelling.  We were talking about  a subject.  It's things like  personal information  about us 
[03:05:00]  and ways there are  to get that  certain information.  Line four says...  I'm not even going to read it.  No, I know.  I know what it is.  It's access to certain...  Right.  Why would I want that  on the air  to make more people know  that there's information  that they could get?  Well, I've put up stuff before  that I would never think  you guys would ever want to  go to  and then you guys  make something out of it.  So I don't want to...  change...  If you don't want to go to it,  I wouldn't think  you'd go to it.  Okay.  I just would look at that 
[03:05:30]  and think like...  Okay.  I mean, it's nothing...  Next time that comes up,  I won't let that go through.  It's nothing that I would,  you know,  freak out about.  I fucking...  That's why I'm armed.  Right.  Absolutely.  I know.  But, you know,  it's something...  You know,  who would want to touch  on that, really?  All right.  I don't know.  Did you like butt files?  Yeah, it was good.  Butt files was great.  And I have no problem with dating.  You do have a sense of humor.  Yeah, absolutely.  I have no problem with dating.  I actually...  I enjoy...  Dating and I have hung out.  Sex with Danny?  I enjoy sex with Danny. 
[03:06:00]  Bam, there it is.  Ah, there it is.  That's the line.  Let's update the piece.  No, it's cool, man.  And I've hung out  with Danny outside of here  and honestly,  outside of this building,  he's a cool motherfucker.  But...  See?  Yeah.  Outside of this building.  Wow, that was so weird.  I like you inside the building.  The building affects me.  I think the building affects me.  It's everyone.  I'm a fan of Inside Danny.  It's like the Overlook Hotel.  This place is like  the Overlook Hotel.  In fact,  I never want to see Danny 
[03:06:30]  outside of this building.  You're not a fan  of Outside Danny?  Outside Danny.  I'm a fan of Inside Danny.  Jesus.  I'm just kidding.  I love Danny.  That's all I had to say.  So, you know,  whatever.  I don't need it to go any further  if Danny doesn't need  it to go any further.  Dude, I never had a problem  in the first place.  No, I know.  Just listen, man.  I'm just trying to make my point.  For the sake of the show,  I hope it goes further.  All right, well then  fuck you, Danny.  Eat my ass.  Alex Jones, bitch boy.  God damn it. 
[03:07:00]  Oh, shit.  Breaking news.  You've been chosen  to receive a $100  Walmart gift voucher.  Nice!  To find out more,  call  877-448-5786.  Motherfucker.  That's great, dude.  Get me a phone.  You could buy a lot of shit  with that at Walmart.  You could buy a lot of socks,  a lot of sheets,  a lot of Totino's pizza rolls.  Fucking fourth red count sheets.  Wait, where did Troy go?  Make fun of Walmart all you want. 
[03:07:30]  That store knows what it's doing.  You could buy Troy a sweatshirt that fits.  Oh, shit.  All right, so it's a little small.  It's called Slim Fit,  if you're a little younger.  Is that Slim Fit?  That's Slim Fit.  That is fucking...  I love how I have to buy  double XLs from Abercrombie & Fitch  to fit into a large.  Thank you.  Oh, that's not...  Are they tight over there?  Are they tight?  They make you feel bad  because they get the guys  with the fucking...  Are they tight?  They get the guys  with the fucking abs  and the shit, 
[03:08:00]  and that's like...  Who wears a small  from Abercrombie & Fitch?  Normally, I'm a 31-inch waist.  I go to Abercrombie.  I've got to get like a 36.  That don't make sense.  Maybe it's time  to stop shopping there.  Yeah, trust me.  Trust me.  I'm starting to walk by...  I'm going to big and tall.  I've started walking by  Abercrombie & Fitch  more than I've gone in lately.  Don't you feel like  such a fat fuck, too?  Because I have certain  clothing lines like that  where you have to go  and you go,  well, normally I wear 33.  This is fucking ludicrous. 
[03:08:30]  Yeah, this is, you know...  Nothing makes you want  to kill yourself faster  than putting on a sweater  that turns out to be too tight  and you have to look  at yourself in the mirror.  Like, holy...  That'll cling on  every bad curve  and bump on you.  Oh, will it?  That's a bad one.  You'll see your own moles  in some of these  tight fucking sweaters.  Yeah, and you know it  as you're pulling  the neck part  down over your head.  You're just going,  this is going to look  so fucking bad.  You never want to pull a shirt  on where you can see 
[03:09:00]  your belly button  through the shirt.  Right.  Because it divots inward.  It divots in.  Or how about this  when you put on  a short-sleeved shirt  and then you have to,  you realize that you're  getting fatter  because you have to  pull the fucking sleeve,  the short sleeve down.  Because you're just  getting all bunched up.  And I have a legitimate  question about  Abercrombie and Fish.  I swear it's not a goof.  I have no idea.  When I drive home  and I pass that store  on Fifth Avenue,  there's a line around  the corner to get in.  What is that?  That's a gag.  They do that with  the Uggs store  up in my neighborhood too.  What?  They put out like, 
[03:09:30]  Because there's literally  a hundred people.  They put out the velvet rope  and like a carpet  in some places  and they actually  hold people back  so it looks like  it's happening.  So it looks like  there's something going on?  Are you shitting me?  That Abercrombie and Fish,  I would fucking be so pissed.  What is it on?  Fifth Avenue?  I think it's Fifth and Fifty  Sam out in the snow.  I've actually waited  on the dumb line  because I had to get  something or whatever  or wanted to go in there.  and the place  is a warehouse.  It's fucking huge.  But they do that  because of what you just said.  You drive by and like,  Wow, what the fuck's  going on in there today? 
[03:10:00]  I gotta check that out someday.  Is that...  They're making it look like  it's a hot club  or something.  And it's almost every day  so I started thinking  what is this?  Stores are starting to do that.  Uggs is doing that  up in my neighborhood  where there's a line every day  and then you could see  into the store in this case  and it's not that crowded.  That's so dumb.  That's so fucking dumb.  It's one of the things  they're doing now.  I've never bought anything  from Abercrombie and Fitch  ever in my life.  I've gotten like presents  where I open the box.  Sweatpants.  Oh, thanks, FUD.  Shut that fucking box.  You don't like Abercrombie and Fitch stuff? 
[03:10:30]  I dress like a fucking  Cuban militant.  That's like my...  Every day.  It's comfortable.  I don't have to worry about it.  You dress like you're headed  to the militia  right after the show.  What do you mean?  Dwight.  And certainly has a look.  He does.  I've just adopted this whole  I don't give a shit.  I'm dressing in military militant gear.  Every time somebody gives you  a piece of clothing  as a gift,  you go,  can I exchange this for something  in all black flannel? 
[03:11:00]  Can I get something  I can tuck blouse  the pants in my boots with?  Do you have one  with more secret pockets?  I need plenty of pockets.  I do have so many pockets.  You know,  you never know  how many magazines  you gotta take with you.  For the big riot.  You never know, right?  For the big race war.  Sure.  We don't have time  to do the hoarder's clips.  Fuck dang.  Yeah, we could save it.  She's that fat bitch  is gonna be just as obnoxious  next week.  And next week  is the season finale  with the rats.  Yes, with the rats.  Rat guy. 
[03:11:30]  1,500 rats, they're saying?  At least.  In his house?  Yeah.  And he's in there?  Yeah, he's living in there.  They're crawling  all over the place.  They show an entire  fucking room  Can I see the preview?  Filled up with fucking rats.  And the guy is just living there.  It didn't gross me out  as much as I thought it would.  It just was like...  It's pretty twisted and sick,  but I've seen more disgusting...  Yeah.  Like people that live  in their own shit.  Yeah, it was just weird.  The couple that was  throwing their shit-filled  plastic bags  down the stairs  because their bathroom broke  and they were shitting  in plastic garbage bags 
[03:12:00]  tying them up  and throwing them  down the stairs  and there was a mountain  of human shit bags  at the bottom  of the fucking...  Yeah, that's pretty sick.  Was there like flies and stuff?  Oh, flies were the best of it.  Maggots, fucking cocky roaches.  Oh, dude.  Oh, yeah.  That kind of shit  makes me gag, man.  And they opened  the refrigerator  and all the fat...  They're always fat fucking pigs.  They're always talking about like,  I'm a great cook too. 
[03:12:30]  I'm a great cook.  And they show her  frying up some crap  on a hot plate  because the stove  is covered with cat shit.  And they open up  the refrigerator.  There's dead meat juice  like staining it.  And all I'm thinking is,  what is she cooking  that's so good?  How is she saying  she's a good cook  when it's horrible?  I'd rather be  in a VC cave  cooking...  eating what they're cooking  and then some fat bitch  cooking bad meat. 
[03:13:00]  I hate that show  and I watch it every week.  Let's look at this rat guy.  So this is the season finale.  It's online  if you want to check it out  for yourself.  Oh, yeah.  Here he is.  The rat horde  has made Glenn's house  completely uninhabitable.  ...starting sleeping  out here in my office  because they'd crawl up  in a pillow  and start pulling my hair out  to try and make  nesting material out of it.  They've eaten his mattress.  ...where you've got moisture  like your eyeballs  are on your lips  and it'll start licking.  Oh, that's adorable.  ...a little tough  to sleep that way.  My name is John. 
[03:13:30]  I've known Glenn  about 15 years.  What a mullet.  ...they're his friends,  he'll tell you.  Those are my friends.  Hello, friend.  I mean, they just  crawl all over.  Holy shit.  That's a room  full of fucking rats  and he's right in the middle  of them.  They're crawling all over  them as he's feeding them.  ...and sniff all over you.  They look like easy rats, though.  Not as shit  all over the place, dog.  They look like those  easy rats.  They don't look like  the subway rats.  They're not.  They're not.  They're like pet store rats.  He's throwing fucking feet  on the floor  and they're coming  out of everywhere.  I'm out. 
[03:14:00]  I'm not impressed.  I thought they were  subway rats.  That'll creep the shit  out of you.  These are the rats  they feed to the snakes  and stuff.  Yeah, these are pet store rats.  That's what I'm saying.  It didn't freak me out.  1,500 of them.  Nah, it's not as bad.  It's weird.  It's not grossing me out,  though.  You know what I mean?  They almost look like  shit isn't grossing me out.  They almost look like  hamsters, right?  No.  They do.  I'm telling you.  The fact that they ate  his mattress  and they lick his eyeballs.  Eh.  It's still bad,  but I was expecting  to see those fucking  subway rats.  You see one of them  and you're freaked out. 
[03:14:30]  That's what I thought.  And when they first said  it's a guy with rats,  I thought it was going to be  his apartment was so gross  there was rats.  Infestation.  And then that would...  Yeah, he bought a few rats  and let them reproduce.  That's all that is.  All right.  Yeah.  Pet store rats.  Yeah.  Fuck that.  Still bad, Ant.  Yes.  Yeah, yeah.  But I want to see a guy  with the fucking subway rats.  Yeah.  Yeah, just picks him up  off the street  and he gets fucking...  I have actually seen  more disgusting on that show.  Yeah.  The thing you just said  about the meat juice  made me gay. 
[03:15:00]  Meat juice.  Meat juice.  It's one of the grossest  things I've ever heard.  On Twitter,  we got a guy,  Kyle Drum 2002.  2002.  He writes,  OP Radio,  which is my Twitter.  Yes.  Why the fuck  do you shop at Abercrombie?  Grow up a tad  and become a gentleman.  And he writes,  try shopping at Brooks Brothers  for a nice start.  Brooks Brothers.  Brooks Brothers.  Have you ever walked  through a Brooks Brothers?  Brooks Brothers,  yeah,  if you want to go  teach a fucking class.  I know. 
[03:15:30]  Or you want to do  fake casual Friday bullshit.  Do they have the jackets  with the patches  on the sleeves  for an author?  Fuck Brooks Brothers  and fuck Eddie Bauer.  Dude.  Fuck both of those stores.  You ever get a gift certificate  for a store  and you walk through  the entire store  and realize,  fuck,  I got to buy socks.  I got to buy $300  worth of socks  because you can't find one.  That happened to me  at Brooks Brothers.  Yeah.  I ended up buying socks.  I got to walk out  into the mall  and see if anybody  wants to buy  this fucking gift certificate 
[03:16:00]  from me right now  because it's useless.  There's a store called,  I think it's called Monaco.  Yeah.  Yeah,  I know.  I know the store.  It has to be for the gays.  I went in there  with a $200 gift certificate  and I was so bummed out  I couldn't find one  you can't buy the underwear  because even that's  a little like  a little too European  if you know what I mean.  European.  So once again,  socks.  They opened up  with my gift certificate.  They opened up a gay,  mainly gay boutique, 
[03:16:30]  male boutique  across the street  from my apartment.  It's the shit, dude.  The fucking clothes  are awesome.  Really?  Yeah,  they have great  like plaid shirts and shit.  The back of the pants  all cut out?  Yeah,  you got to go up a side.  They're slim.  You got to go up a side  but they're fun.  It's the shit.  Then maybe I shouldn't  be making fun.  Then maybe it's more  of a European thing.  Well,  Brooks Brothers  is just fucking  lame ass,  fucking boring casual shit  and this Monaco,  maybe it's European then.  If you're saying  there's good clothes  at gay boutiques, 
[03:17:00]  then...  This is just a place  run by gay guys  so they know like...  It's not...  But it's not club gay.  It's not fucking...  It's not that shit.  Yeah,  it's like sweaters  and flannel shirts  and shit.  It's a cool fucking shop, man.  They have really cool  t-shirts,  like throwback tees  and stuff.  It's a good place.  It's called Tag.  Either 511 Tactical Wear  or Armani.  That's pretty much  the only places I shop.  Armani?  Armani or 511 Tactical.  Are you wearing the Armani  when you wake up  with the spilt beer? 
[03:17:30]  No, no, that's 511 Tactical.  That's 511.  You need the Tactical gear  for spilt wine and beer.  What the fuck is 511 Tactical Wear?  That's what he's wearing.  It's right there.  They make great socks  because they got their socks too.  Socks are great.  They really are.  Are they the socks  where it's like you can sweat  in them and they don't smell ever?  You feel like you have  10 extra layers of skin.  You pull them on,  they're great.  They're tight.  It's clothing for the military  and the police  and firemen  and emergency service workers. 
[03:18:00]  So it's very durable  yet very comfortable.  And there are, like you said,  plenty of pockets  for slip magazines  and weapons.  Actually, if you look at this,  there is a Velcro  shoulder holster  right there in the shirt  and you just seal it up.  Did you say shirt  as in t-shirt?  It's t-shirt time!  There's a shoulder,  there's a holster 
[03:18:30]  built into the shirt.  Inside the shirt.  Officially,  that would be inside the shirt.  Yeah,  all you gotta do  is you put a weapon in there  and you seal it up  like a little PPKS,  a little 380.  That reminds me of like,  that reminds me of a shirt  that I would've got  when I was a kid  at like Toys R Us.  Like a fake army shirt.  It's got a holster in it.  Exactly.  I totally am.  I'm like that.  I'm like,  that's the coolest thing ever. 
[03:19:00]  Every shirt I have  has some hidden pocket  for a weapon.  I like it.  You never know.  Fuck it.  Fuck it.  Yeah, I'll tell you what.  And there's Velcro  on the sides of some of them,  the longer ones,  where it tears up  so you have access  to a hip holster  and just,  you know,  they're all made for,  you don't know  what the fuck's gonna happen.  Maybe I should start  carrying a gun.  What do you guys think?  Where do you live?  New York City?  I live in Hell's Kitchen.  Good luck  on getting a gun.  More importantly,  this guy wants to make fun of you  because you shopped 
[03:19:30]  at a gay place.  Oh,  there's a surprise.  You're not supposed  to be gay ever  on this show.  I know.  Yeah, God forbid.  You might as well  suck the cock  when walking through the dark.  Ah, you suck dick.  That's what it turns into  on this show.  Go ahead, Kevin and Selle.  We'll give you a shot here.  Hey, Joe,  you're the only Italian guy  in the history of Norristown  to ever shop  at a gay man's clothing store.  That's because  there's no gay man's  clothing stores  in Norristown.  Are you from Norristown?  Yes, sir.  Do I know you  from back home? 
[03:20:00]  No, probably not.  This is how fuck...  Let me tell you  about Norristown.  I just did a show  back there recently.  That's basically  where I'm from.  It is the most...  I love it.  It's home.  It is the most racist,  closed-minded place  I've ever been.  I fuck with people  when I go back there.  I go,  when you say something...  Could I get a realtor's number?  When you say something  progressive  or open-minded  in Norristown,  they react the way  people react  everywhere else  when you say  something racist. 
[03:20:30]  They're like,  oh, you're creeping me out, dude.  What are you talking about?  I got a Philly thing.  You heard about  the Kensington  fucking killer there?  Serial killer?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, and the rest  of the country  is not talking about it.  Guy's killing  fucking hookers  every other day.  He's got a count.  Really?  His numbers are impressive  and no one's talking about it.  Supposedly,  it's a black guy  killing fucking  drug addict hookers. 
[03:21:00]  I love how the blacks  are making their way  into serial killing.  It's amazing.  We're very diverse  as a community.  I like this.  There's fewer places  on Earth  that I've seen people  give less of a shit  about than Kensington.  That's why people  are not talking about it.  And that's why, right?  Everybody in Philly,  when you talk to people  in Philly,  and you go,  where are you from?  I'm from...  You go,  where, Kensington?  Fuck you, bro.  I ain't from fucking Kensington.  All right, dude.  That's not to be from.  Is that bad? 
[03:21:30]  It's not that it's that bad.  It's just...  It's just one of those...  It's...  You know,  I don't want to...  I don't want to shit on...  I love Philly.  It's home.  There's some shit going on  in Kensington, though, man.  Yeah, but it's...  Philly's fucked up.  I don't know what the exact number is,  but it's bad  how many he's gotten so far.  Philly's crime rate,  they're competing with,  like, Detroit, dude.  It's a fucking war zone, man.  Seriously.  It's really, really bad there, man.  So, you know,  you don't hear shit about Detroit on the...  There's fucking bears  and coyotes and shit  living in downtown Detroit now. 
[03:22:00]  I didn't know that  until I went to Detroit.  You'd think that'd be  international fucking news  that that happened somewhere.  Wait, what are you...  For real?  I'm not pushing.  Wild animals...  Are starting to take over the city?  That's how abandoned  downtown Detroit...  Dude, or...  Twelve fucking monkeys, dude.  There it is.  Seriously.  Twelve monkeys.  They pulled back the border.  Of...  Of downtown Detroit.  Downtown Detroit  because they couldn't afford  to keep...  To upkeep 
[03:22:30]  or to even have  these abandoned buildings.  So now there's just this  no man's land zone  of decaying buildings.  Show me one story  that you got wild animals  in downtown Detroit.  I gotta see this.  Dude, it's fucking...  And what are the animals?  I got a website for you.  It's like bears  and coyotes and shit.  It's fucking insane, dude.  No, bears.  Come on.  I would believe coyotes.  It costs...  This is what I learned  when I was in Detroit.  I did a show out there  with Patton Oswalt.  He was on yesterday.  Yeah, that's why I bring it up.  We were laughing about this.  He was great.  He's hilarious.  We were laughing about this  because they were telling us 
[03:23:00]  that it costs $7,000  to buy a house  in downtown Detroit.  Oh, no.  Yeah, yeah.  We did all that on the show.  Yeah, you just can't...  You could get a very cheap house up there.  Because you won't have a heat.  Like, they won't come get your trash.  There's just no services.  Lions and...  ...some bears.  Oh, my.  Lions and...  ...some bears.  Oh, my.  Patton's the funniest thing.  Patton's the funniest thing  to the audience.  He goes,  you guys are fucking insane.  He goes,  you could come to Detroit  and be like,  you know you guys have vampires  in your downtown area? 
[03:23:30]  And you guys are just like,  yeah, but just don't go down there.  Vampires.  That really is how they treat it.  Look at these houses.  That would be one of your houses  that you would buy.  It's completely fucking boarded up.  Holes in the room.  Looks like it was scaled.  Do you see the black  from previous flames?  Fires.  Oh, there's holes in the roof  like it was shelled.  How bad do you want to...  That house looks like it was shelled.  How bad do you want to walk around  that house right now?  Oh, so bad.  I love walking around  in old fucking houses.  Oh, yeah, that would be great.  You know my old school,  they...  Step on needles and crack pipes.  They unfortunately rebuilt it finally. 
[03:24:00]  Washington Drive School  and a little local action  set up Port Long Island.  Washington Drive School  sat there for,  I don't know,  at least 10 years  with...  They did nothing to it.  And finally,  you figured out  how to get in there.  We took a walk in there once.  That shit is so fucking cool to me, man.  There were classrooms  with the kids' stuff  still hanging  from 10, 12 years ago.  Underwear.  Untouched.  Yeah.  I love that shit.  With the ceilings coming down  from the water  and the floors 
[03:24:30]  were all buckled.  I love that shit.  Dude,  there was an abandoned  mental institution  near where I grew up  and it was like,  you know,  dude,  we were like 13,  14 years old.  It was like our life's blood  to figure out  how to break into this.  And you couldn't get into it.  It was like the barbed wire  and shit around it.  But...  I'm putting this out there right now.  I know people do it illegally  because I'm watching the videos online.  I even tweeted one of them recently.  If someone could get me  under fucking ground  in New York City,  legit,  I want to go.  Could someone do that? 
[03:25:00]  Where?  I want to go.  It's more than just sewers.  There's all sorts...  Down here in the sewers.  There's all sorts of shit going on.  I'll take it down here.  I'll be by.  There's rivers  that are still flowing  under New York City.  There's old subway stations  that they just boarded up  that looks like it did  when they were still open.  I want to do that shit,  but I want to do it illegally.  I don't feel like getting arrested.  Someone can help me out.  I would love to.  I would do that.  I would go underground.  You want to go with me?  Yeah, I'll go.  I'll go.  Because I guarantee  that fucking river of slime  from Ghostbusters 
[03:25:30]  is actually down there.  I would go down there.  I want to go...  I hear there's some amazing stuff.  There's like the secret tunnel  that what president wasn't at  that it was his escape route  out of New York City.  They still got that.  Can we go to...  Oh, the original subway tunnel.  It's just a round tunnel  with a round train.  Let's go to that city  where the people live  in the boxes down there.  Oh, the mole people.  I learned about that.  They got a lot of those fuckers out  in 96,  but people are still living underground.  But just not as much now.  They should have those looked at. 
[03:26:00]  God, how scary would it be down there?  I know how to do this illegally.  There's a couple spots I know of,  but I just don't...  I'm not brave enough  to jump the fence.  How do you do it illegally?  What?  Can you talk about  how you can do it illegally?  Or is it like  the kind of thing  you can't talk about?  One video I posted recently  was from Vimeo.  The guy was insane.  He fucking climbed  to the top  of the Williamsburg Bridge  illegally.  Had to jump a couple fences,  get inside one of those towers,  and...  What'd he do?  He just fucking climbed 
[03:26:30]  all the way to the top,  which is insane.  And then he went  where the old Amtrak tunnels are,  where the mole people were.  He...  I think he went down  to Canal Street,  which...  It's called Canal Street  because it used to be  a real fucking canal  providing water for New York.  No shit.  And he knew  the grate to open up  to go down  to see the actual river  still happening,  which they turn into a sewer.  There's gotta be  a legal way to do it.  I mean,  it's gotta be as simple  as some rep from the...  Cops or some of the,  you know,  some of the MTA guys, 
[03:27:00]  somebody.  Somebody could help me out.  There's gotta be.  I would go down there  in two seconds.  That show Underground Cities  or whatever it was called,  the under...  What was it called,  that?  It went away,  unfortunately.  We had the host on.  Cities of the Underground.  Cities of the Underground.  That's my shit.  I love that stuff.  What show was it?  I never saw it.  It was just Cities of the Underground.  He went from city to city  checking out all the shit  that's happening  underground.  Like every city has  shit going on underneath it.  That, you know,  the average person's  not allowed down to anymore.  What was like  the craziest thing?  Craziest thing was  where the fuck was he? 
[03:27:30]  He was in one of these  Asian countries  where the whole mountainside  was like, you know,  there was a whole  underground city  under these mountains  and stuff.  That's some fucked up shit.  Yeah.  Wait, but when you say...  They had for the war  and stuff,  so they had like a,  you know,  some of those fucking  old Vietnam tunnels  and all that.  You didn't realize  how involved they were.  The Ho Chi Minh Trail.  All that shit.  Into Cambodia.  In Portland,  they had like trap doors  and old bars  where you're drinking 
[03:28:00]  and then the door,  and now you're underground  in these rooms and stuff  and they ship you off  for the...  Oh, that was when  they used to steal people  for ships.  Because they needed...  They needed mates.  They needed hands  on these ships  to bring back  all the fucking molasses  or whatever the fuck it was.  I forgot now.  But these guys  wouldn't volunteer  because it was  two years at sea.  Yes, you scallywag.  So they would fucking,  they would fucking  get you drunk.  They'd Shanghai you.  Yeah, there you go.  The Shanghai...  As being Shanghai.  Exactly.  So they would get you drunk  and then the trap doors  would fucking open 
[03:28:30]  and there you are  underground  and then they ship you off.  Beaten unconscious.  By the time you wake up  from your horrendous fucking,  you know, buzz,  you're on a ship  and it's too late.  Sound thrashing  that you got.  Jesus Christ.  It was a great show.  I should try to find it  on a box set of it  or something.  Jesus Christ.  I gotta check that out.  How much would you love  to have a trap door?  Anywhere,  just to have one.  Yeah.  Just laugh at your friends.  Ha ha, dick.  Oh, how great would it be  to have that?  A trap door.  Seriously.  I'd be too scared 
[03:29:00]  to use it though  because somebody would sue you.  They would.  I twisted my knee  when you're trapped door.  Like the great Danton  when his mattress was gone.  Let's go to sit.  Ha ha.  Why is the sitch  dressing like John Travolta now?  Was that on last night?  Jesus.  He is such a...  What the fuck  is he doing?  He looks like  Saturday Night Fever now.  I hate in this fucking cunt.  Which one?  Fucking Wendy Williams.  Ugh.  She sucks.  That's Tyler Perry.  Oh, shit.  Is that Medea?  Yeah.  People don't know that. 
[03:29:30]  It's Tyler Perry in a wig  doing a talk show.  Figured he could.  Oh, gosh.  Actually, I'm starting to think  that Wendy Williams  looks like Herman Munster.  But no one's on it yet.  Nah, I'm not feeling that.  Because her arms  are really fucking...  Remember when, like,  they try to squeeze Herman  into, like, weird clothes,  like a football uniform?  Oh, it's hysterical.  Little helmet on his head.  She looks like...  She doesn't look like  Herman Munster,  but she does look like  Fred Gwynn.  Yeah.  She looks like  regular Fred Gwynn. 
[03:30:00]  Okay, there you go.  You know what I mean?  I knew there was  something there.  Sammy in Queens.  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey.  Yeah, oh,  there's some Norwegian guy.  I don't know his name.  Recently had a documentary  on TV  and something in the paper  where he was allowed  to go under New York  and found all rivers,  streams of water,  and secret tunnels.  And men that would do favors.  Google this guy.  He's Norwegian.  Well, I'm trying to, like,  get someone to do it  so I can do it illegally,  I guess.  And I want to do it  in other cities.  I heard in Rochester,  a place I used to live, 
[03:30:30]  there's a fucking subway system,  and that one's easy  to go under  and check out.  Man, I would, yeah.  An old subway system  in a city  that had no business  having a subway.  Are the trains  all down there still?  I don't know.  I don't know how.  I was just reading  about it online recently.  I'm going to go down  and run around with Blade.  Yeah.  I'm going to go underground  in a little while  to Midtown Tunnel.  Oh, yeah.  It's amazing.  Joe, I curse you.  Goes right under a river.  We went late because of you.  Fuck you.  Because of me.  Yeah.  What are we promoting?  We're out of here.  Fuck this. 
[03:31:00]  I don't need to go underground  that bad.  I need to go home.  Righteous Kill every Tuesday  at the Ace of Clubs,  and I'm at CB's Comedy Club  all weekend  in the West Village.  Very good.  On Twitter.  Oh, Twitter.  Yeah, Joe DeRosa Comedy  on Twitter.  Let's start tweeting more, Joe.  I did.  I got about 50 things  since we've been  on the thing here.  50 requests.  Followers.  You know what I mean.  Whatever the fuck it is.  Some things.  I got some things.  Yeah, yeah.  On the thing.  Hey, you.  All right, guys.  Have a great week. 
[03:31:30]  I enjoy sex with Danny.  I enjoy sex with Danny. </pre>
