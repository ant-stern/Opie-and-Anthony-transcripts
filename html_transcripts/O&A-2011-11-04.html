<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with light banter, quickly transitioning to a discussion about a viral video of a whale breaching near surfers.  E-Rock, a staff member, was present and shared in the amusement and shock. The conversation then veered to Occupy Wall Street at Zuccotti Park, specifically a video of a homeless man accidentally injuring a Turkish man while kicking a tent.  The hosts discussed various incidents at the encampment, including reports of sexual assault and a suspected rape.

A major portion of the show was dominated by a heated argument between E-Rock and Roland, another staff member.  E-Rock was furious because Roland had given away E-Rock’s Conan O’Brien taping tickets after E-Rock’s unsuccessful attempt at a fake sick day was exposed on air.  The hosts delved into the details of the conflict, replaying the events from each party's perspective, with accusations of lying and mistreatment flying back and forth.  A brief mention was made of a listener calling about a 19-year-old sleeping with a 15-year-old.  The E-Rock/Roland feud continued throughout the show, with ongoing speculation about the underlying causes of their tension. Cupcakes were brought to the studio and intermittently mentioned.

The internal staff conflict continued in the next segment, focusing on a blow-up between Roland and Eric ("Iraq") over Roland leaving Eric outside a venue and a subsequent disagreement about Eric's sick day call.  Additional staff conflicts were aired, including tensions between Troy Kwan and Eric, and fallout from a controversial show clip.  The hosts engaged in profanity-laced insults during the discussions. A listener’s insensitive comment about the controversial clip was also addressed. The show then discussed a Jimmy Kimmel segment showing children's tearful reactions to learning their parents had eaten their Halloween candy.  Finally, the hosts reviewed a self-serving year-end email from SiriusXM's Scott Greenstein, which heavily promoted sports programming and only briefly mentioned the Opie and Anthony Show.  Troy Kwan was present in the studio throughout this segment.

The broadcast shifted gears to discuss love triangles and ménage à trois, followed by reminiscing about game show hosts like Alex Trebek and Alan Ludden, and the difficulty of various game shows, including *Jeopardy!* and *Cash Cab*. A substantial portion focused on a YouTube video of Michael Larson, the *Press Your Luck* contestant who exploited a pattern in the game's randomizer to win big.  The hosts analyzed Larson's strategy, his reaction, his subsequent financial troubles, and his eventual death.  Multiple listener calls about *Press Your Luck* and Michael Larson were incorporated.  The hosts then discussed a mass-text message from Dr. Steve, revealing it wasn’t personalized as they initially thought.  The conversation then jumped to Lindsay Lohan's Playboy photoshoot and a discussion about various online nude images, debating the merits of different types of online nude photography.  The segment ended with mention of an upcoming guest, Chris Hardwick, and a near-accident involving one of the hosts.

Chris Hardwick, author of "The Nerdist Way," was the guest for the next segment.  The show began with crude sexual jokes, followed by promotion of Jim Norton's upcoming Borgata comedy show featuring Doug Stanhope, Dave Attell, and Artie Lange.  There was a humorous exchange about a misplaced plug for the show.  Hardwick discussed his book, a productivity guide based on his experiences,  sharing anecdotes about his competitive chess past, and his weight loss after quitting heavy drinking.  The conversation covered the differences between "nerds" and "dorks," the evolution of nerd culture, and Hardwick's physics background, including the Higgs boson. A listener updated them on Gus Lipman, Hardwick's childhood chess rival.  The discussion moved to Hardwick’s Nerdist podcast network (including "Sex Nerd Sandra"), his minor role in Spider-Man, and his preference for casual movie viewing.  They analyzed Rotten Tomatoes reviews of "Tower Heist" and Eddie Murphy's career.  Hardwick promoted his book and Google Plus.

The final segment with Chris Hardwick began with a discussion about the overwhelming importance of sex, especially in youth, leading to reminiscing about how the pursuit of sex often resulted in abandoning hobbies.  This sparked discussion of Hardwick’s past hobbies and a tangent about Julie McCullough, including speculation about her dismissal from *Growing Pains*.  The conversation shifted to Hardwick’s radio (mentioning K-Rock colleagues Kevin and Bean, Jed the Fish, Richard Blade, Adam Carolla, and Jimmy Kimmel) and television experiences, and the greater creative freedom of podcasts.  He promoted his book, *The Nerdist Way*, and upcoming appearances on Conan and *Talking Dead*. The segment concluded with promotion of the Opie and Anthony Borgata show (featuring Artie Lange, Dave Attell, and Doug Stanhope) and a humorous recurring bit about "good boy" and "naughty boy" phones.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  Yeah, it's Friday.  I like to say TGIF, everybody. TGIF.  Friday. Yeah. That's what I'm talking about.  Ah, the weekend.  I guess for E-Rock, that's pretty cool.  Like it went from Wednesday right to Friday.  Oh, boy.  Is E-Rock having a cupcake? 
[00:00:30]  E-Rock, have one. That's right.  Oh, boy.  He's trying to fly under the radar.  Oh, sorry.  He got to his position.  Like the kind of bird.  Come on, poor kid.  You don't have to fly under the sonar.  Have some of this.  Good, dude.  E-Rock almost ate a surfer yesterday.  Oh, shit.  Oh, that's not even.  What, Sam?  That's not even.  What's wrong? What happened?  Oh, that's not even.  He's getting tweeted the same things.  Oh, you were?  You see that?  A giant friggin' whale comes breaching through the surface of the ocean, eating a fuckload 
[00:01:00]  of fish, right next to people in a little fucking, what were they, in a kayak or something?  Yeah, I think they were on some flat boards, right?  Some long boards.  Yeah.  What do they call those things?  That was fucked up.  Those paddle boards.  I think they might have been some paddle boards, but they were sitting on them.  That would make me shit my pants.  All right.  Because it's just quiet.  The ocean surface is just what it is.  Yeah.  And then out of nowhere, this giant fucking whale.  You see this video, Jimmy?  No.  It's amazing.  Watch this.  Imagine you're just sitting there. 
[00:01:30]  Look, they're on little surfboards.  Oh, maybe they are just surfboards.  There's a guy with a kayak and then a surfboard.  And then out of nowhere.  They're just chillin'.  Hey, what's up, man?  I've heard of that thing.  How's the surf today?  I've heard of the ad.  It's pretty good.  I'm enjoying it.  I've heard of the ad.  And then, whoa!  They're trying to say, I guess the humpback almost swallowed the surfer.  No, no.  Stop.  You don't have to make it more impressive.  How scary is that?  It's an amazing video.  It was eating a shitload of fish.  Wow.  Yeah.  Watch the fish come up.  Anthony pointed this out. 
[00:02:00]  Yeah, a bunch of silver fish are all flapping around because it's pushing it up before it eats it.  Yeah, they're pushing all the fish up to the surface so they can get as many as possible.  They just kind of brush it up.  Yeah, that's fucked up.  And then the seagulls go, well, thank you very much.  And they dive in.  Thanks.  That happened to me one time, too.  I just jumped on his back.  I was like, boom.  It did not.  Yeah, Chip.  I can see that happening.  That's a pretty cool video, huh?  Fuck, yeah.  Surf almost swallowed by a whale.  How many dislikes does this video have?  But he wasn't almost swallowed.  The whale just came up to eat some fish.  I love the people that have to dislike everything on YouTube. 
[00:02:30]  I don't like it.  How do you not like a humpback whale popping up out of the surface really close to a surfer like that?  How many dislikes?  27.  27 assholes out there.  Do you see the name?  There's a guy named Syl, and his last name is Verfish.  Right.  Because he was a silver fish.  YouTube should be allowed to go to your house and just fucking yank you out of your home if you dislike a video like that.  Jonah.  So stupid.  Right?  Jonah wouldn't like it.  Pinocchio. 
[00:03:00]  Oh, boy.  No, unless...  He wouldn't like it.  You're probably right.  Captain Ahab.  I just wanted to show you how much that hurts.  Right?  Right?  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Right.  Anyway, we almost got our death at Zuccotti Park.  There's a fine, fine front page today in one of the New York papers.  Yes.  They're the same papers to me.  Zuccotti Park.  They're spelling it differently.  Oh, they're calling it Z-O-O.  And then Dash, C-O-T-T-I, Zuccotti. 
[00:03:30]  And then they have a still picture of a little brawl that was going on down there.  A Turkish brawl.  I believe it's a Turkish madman.  Yeah.  And this is kind of what we were discussing yesterday.  There are people down there that truly are trying to do something in protest, and then  you've got a lot of people just sleeping their days away in these tents.  Oh, my God, King, it's the Turkish madman!  It's some slobberknocker at Zuccotti!  So you've got this guy from Cleveland who was mad yesterday.  He's like, what the fuck?  I don't even have a tent. 
[00:04:00]  I'm up every morning early trying to get something done down here.  And these fucking bums are sleeping.  So the idiot kicked one of the tents.  Oh, boy.  Turns out he kicks that bald Turkish animal in the head.  Wrong tent.  Kicked wrong tent.  Is this the guy?  Oh, there's an actual video of it?  Oh, shit.  Crank it up.  And I haven't been able to sleep.  Wait, wait, start over.  That's a guy?  Start over.  With that voice?  Oh.  What?  I haven't got a tent!  Sleeping may not be safe anymore at the Occupy Wall Street headquarters downtown. 
[00:04:30]  Headquarters.  Protesters woke up to loud yells from a homeless man early Thursday morning.  I've been here for three months, and I haven't been able to sleep like this lazy ass.  Motherf*****.  Oh, boy.  I don't give a f**k who's in this tent.  Pause that.  You want to fight?  I bet you give a f**k who's in that tent.  Pause that.  Knowing what happened.  He chose unwisely.  That could be a great new game show.  Kick the tent.  Kick the tent and see what happens. 
[00:05:00]  And see who comes out.  Because this kid, oh, knowing what happened, he kicks this tent and goes, I don't give a  s**k who's in that tent.  That could have been a couple of girls or some skinny little guy or something.  Oh, my God.  He picked the Turkish maniac.  This big, bald-headed, shaved-headed, f**king crazy motherfucker.  I believe he's a, like, he used to work in the military.  Oh, yeah.  He's some kind of Turkish army guy.  From, from, uh, Turkey.  Yeah.  What's his sign say?  U.S. slash Turk army ended my diplomat career. 
[00:05:30]  So, this guy is an animal.  Yeah.  And this kid from Cleveland, I think he's from Cleveland.  I don't care.  Could you go back to the kick?  Yeah, he kicked that tent.  Because he don't give a f**k, right?  You can hear the head getting kicked.  And he don't know who's in there.  Not only did he kick the tent, yeah, he kicked this guy's head through the tent.  Now, would you like to trade the tent you kicked for the tent number two, or are you going  to stick with it?  Oh, this would be a great Japanese game show.  Kick the tent. 
[00:06:00]  All right, hit it.  ...day morning.  I've been here for three months, and I haven't been able to sleep like these lazy a**.  What the f**k is this?  Kick the tent.  I don't give a f**k who's in the tent.  You want to fight?  You want to get f**k up?  But protesters are no whips.  Some even fight back.  Look at this animal.  I clobbered him.  F**k up.  Yeah. 
[00:06:30]  The homeless man was quickly escorted out of the park.  He's mentally ill.  He's a police agent.  He's a Bloomberg agent.  Oh, he's a Bloomberg agent.  Disturbing and disrupting the protests.  He's not normal, guys.  A lot of homeless people have come into the camp.  A lot of people with mental issues.  They participate.  They're part of the 99%.  It's something that's going to happen.  You know what I mean?  It's not the first time.  It won't be the last time it happened.  Another protester from Alabama claimed she was sexually assaulted. 
[00:07:00]  With her friends, they stayed at a stranger's tent, hoping to be shielded from the cold.  An hour, half an hour into being in the tent, while he thought I was asleep, he put his hand up my shirt.  Oh, man.  I would still grope her, too.  And then me and my friends got our stuff and left his tent.  Pause.  Pause.  That was a guy just going for a move.  We went for a move.  Yeah, it wasn't a stop.  Chicks go into your tent, you're thinking, I'm going to get some.  As soon as she comes into your tent, you're thinking, okay, she's up for maybe something.  And then the guy makes a move. 
[00:07:30]  And she says no, and that was the end of it.  Is that sexual harassment, you think?  Harassment, but that's not assault.  It's not assault.  Okay, yeah.  I don't think so.  It's called dating.  She was sleeping.  She was grabbing some tits.  She hasn't done that.  When we were growing up, there was nothing called date rape.  Ass, gas, or grass.  No one rides for free.  That's right.  That's what I say.  They made up that date rape crap after we left college.  That was just called.  Or a couple of us left college.  A little dumbest one in the room.  Being a little wilful.  Yeah, so hit this again. 
[00:08:00]  ...the man after reporting the incident to a volunteer security.  This comes after another protester, Occupy Wall Street kitchen worker Tanya Exibusan,  was suspected of raping another demonstrator.  Wow.  But news like this doesn't faze Kara.  I can't imagine that a rape would happen here simply because we all live in such close  quarters.  Like, if anyone were to get attacked, all you have to do is scream security and you've  got somebody in your tent, you know?  The NYPD and volunteer security continue to monitor the Occupy Wall Street area. 
[00:08:30]  This is Maria Sandoval for the New York Post.  She's kind of right, though.  I mean, the drugs must be really good or something because they are sleeping on top of each other.  How do you sleep through someone getting raped?  This is fucking, by choking her out, I mean, this...  I guess we'd have to, you know, get the details, but...  That's crazy shit.  What about the Turk guy?  What the fuck is she doing down there?  That Turk guy was great.  He's saying that the other guy was an agent for Bloomberg.  Well, he's nuts, too.  He's crazy, too.  He took a nice left jab to that guy's head, though.  He kind of clobbered him. 
[00:09:00]  He didn't even punch him.  He just went...  Hit him.  It was a George the Animal Steel kind of a little...  Kick the tent.  Guys, do you want to fight?  He gets out in fights.  Can you imagine this animal comes out of a tent?  What would you do?  What would you do?  It was kind of a swing-punch mush.  He's like an old-school circus strongman.  He's got that type of physique, you know?  And then what's with the security guys with the yellow fucking vests on?  They're like the police of the fucking park? 
[00:09:30]  Well, I guess I was wrong, man.  I told you that, you know, maybe they do have their own little security force.  I'd evoke you ain't the boss of me.  That's what I would do.  I'd claim...  Nice.  Because there's no...  Nice.  It's not a policeman.  It's not anything.  I'd be like, I'm exercising my right to say you ain't the boss of me.  Right.  Yeah.  And he's got him in a chokehold.  Cops can't even do chokeholds.  And this motherfucker's got him in a chokehold.  Well, they get their own rules, man.  They certainly do.  They're trying to start their own police force. 
[00:10:00]  Their own hospitals.  The library.  All the lunatics.  Well, the library's getting a little soggy.  They can't keep all their books dry.  They gotta get tarps over them.  Well, they're trying.  Pronto.  They're certainly trying.  Gives a shit.  These fucking idiots.  How many bedbugs must be down there?  Oh, God.  We're fucking...  Nah, man.  They're scrubbing constantly.  No, but just in the tent and the clothing?  There's no way to keep it off.  They're scrubbing constantly.  No way.  They got cleaning supplies.  No way to keep it off.  They got a whole area of mops and such.  I'm sure it's so sanitary. 
[00:10:30]  Yep.  How come no one else is eating?  What?  I ate two cupcakes.  Because I'm trying not to.  They're delicious.  How about you not bring it up?  Can't help it.  You want an apple pie?  They look delicious.  Yeah, but I forgot about them, and now you have to bring it up again.  Because I want another one, but I'm not going to have one.  You've had two already?  I had two, but I won't have one.  Jimmy, you should have another one.  Oh, but you should have an apple pie.  It's Friday, for God's sake.  Don't do it, man.  It's Friday, Friday.  I can't look at someone eating that.  My willpower is there. 
[00:11:00]  I'm not touching it.  Why don't we make it a treat, Dave, for everyone, then?  Why did Jimmy get cupcakes?  A fan brought them to the Stress Factory.  I guess he owns a la Cupcakes in Glenrock, and he just brought them to the...  And I didn't want to eat them there, so I brought them in here.  Plug all alert!  Plug all alert!  Now you get the phone call from the place.  We didn't send any cupcakes.  Ah, fuck!  Dude, the fucking...  How was the Stress Factory?  It was good.  It'll be amazing this weekend.  I know things all saw that.  Yeah.  Nice.  But, fuck, man, that good. 
[00:11:30]  I had a chocolate chip.  Are you tired?  What's that?  What's that?  Yo, what's that?  I'm exhausted.  Are you?  Yeah, I'm tired.  That'll make sure you're chill.  Aw, yimmy.  We probably should go home early today.  We did overtime yesterday.  We did, like, a fucking...  Because I'm not giving these guys any extra time.  Like a half hour.  I know.  I can't stress enough that I don't think that you guys get rollover minutes for your show.  Well, tough shit.  Until I read differently.  Yeah.  Well, then...  And then even then.  Well, they're going to be bummed out when we leave every day at 10 when there's some good 
[00:12:00]  things we could have been doing at 10 o'clock.  Just punch right out.  So this is what we do now.  So what time can we leave today?  9.43, I think.  Why don't we have rollover minutes?  9.43.  Technically, you went until, I think, 10.16, 10.17.  Let's call it 10.17.  Okay.  Split the difference.  But still, I don't think you get to keep that 17 minutes.  See, I think we should do the shit show one week for four days.  Right.  And then just take off Friday.  Well...  And it rolls over to a whole day off.  Well, you guys are welcome.  How long was my phone call on the shit show yesterday? 
[00:12:30]  Oh!  That was three or four minutes, right?  I was probably closer to five or six.  I was trying to call the line.  It was busy.  9.43.  9.43.  9.30.  I'm out at 9.38 today.  Damn.  Just calling in, I really don't think counts at all.  Didn't have to.  Fuck yeah, it does.  Didn't have to.  No, I know you didn't have to, but it was nice of you to do that.  Keeps people tuned in.  Fuck yeah, man.  The audience fucking goes like this when I call in.  And then back down after I hang up.  I haven't seen the charts. 
[00:13:00]  So 9.38 for me.  9.43 for Anthony.  And Jimmy's tired, so he might go home now.  I can't.  Aw.  Why?  Because I forgot to take a score on sale at 10.  I think I wanted to drive back from New Jersey and do this.  And drive back down tonight.  I wanted to stay there and sleep.  Of course.  So I can't.  Jimmy.  We got a 19-year-old that's in trouble.  What?  And one of the occupies.  Jay in Texas.  Yeah, this is Jerry.  Hey, down here.  In Dallas.  I didn't hear the story.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. 
[00:13:30]  You got to slow down because you got an accent that might be tough to listen to.  Yeah.  I can't talk about that.  Yeah.  I'm in Dallas.  I'm in Dallas.  You know.  Try not to be a.  Is it his phone or is it?  It's his phone, I think.  Oh, it's crap at all.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm not sure if it was his accent or the phone.  Your phone's really fucked.  In Texas, a guy in one of the occupies.  Well, one of the occupies would be in Texas, Dallas, I guess, arrested for sleeping with  a 19-year-old who happened to be 15 years old.  Oh, the 19-year-old slept with a 15-year-old and caused the problem?  No, no. 
[00:14:00]  This guy thought she was 19.  Arrested for sleeping with a 19-year-old who happened to be 15.  Oh, she lied.  Oh, boy.  Liar, liar.  Pants coming off.  That's what I said.  By the way, Troy's an asshole.  Yeah, your phone sucks.  Maybe try a little later, sir.  I believe he said, by the way, Troy's an asshole.  Oh.  Oh, Team E-Rock.  That was a Team E-Rock call.  Team fucking E-Rock.  Troy came off looking a little bad yesterday.  He always does.  He doesn't care.  Yeah, he doesn't care.  Is Roland here yet?  Oh, God.  Eric says no. 
[00:14:30]  Oh, well, Eric doesn't want Roland to come in, I would gather.  Because then we'd have to rehash some of the story, find out what happened.  Well, according to Sam, there's a lot of rehashing we have to do.  Yeah, because a lot of people want to know.  See, the biggest question that people want to know, did E-Rock attend the Conan O'Brien taping yesterday?  Oh, boy.  Here comes rolling down the fucking wall.  So that's the number one thing people just want to know.  Right.  Well, what's the setup?  What happened yesterday?  All I know is I didn't do shit.  I mean, it was so confusing, actually, what happened. 
[00:15:00]  But E-Rock had taken a day off, which everyone deemed a fake day off.  But let the facts state, because E-Rock's pissed at a lot of people today.  I fucking said it, that everyone takes fake sick days at this company.  Everyone fucking does it.  Yeah, but you also don't call them at home on the air.  Oh, boy.  Fucking turn off your phone.  No one's going to wake me up at 6.15 ever.  Is E-Rock mad today?  Ever.  Huh? 
[00:15:30]  Are you mad today, Eric?  What do you think?  Oh, boy.  Oh, you see how he slams his fucking mic button on?  And he's not fine.  And he's not near the mic.  Like, he's backed up.  He doesn't want to be in camera view whatsoever.  Yeah, what is up with that?  He really is far back there.  Yeah, his is.  Damn.  He's not fine.  Roland?  I blame Roland.  Yeah.  Because I didn't do shit.  He was protecting you.  I didn't do shit.  You did not do shit.  Thank you.  See?  He's Roland.  You're an innocent bystander.  Roland's protecting Opie because Opie threatened him and said, if you don't protect me, I 
[00:16:00]  will say no to all your guests.  Hey, by the way, if we do radio past 10, because there's a really good point coming in from Joe.  It might be a union guy.  Time and a half after 10 o'clock?  I don't think so.  Time and a half are over.  As a matter of fact, I believe after 10 o'clock.  17, so time and a half would be...  Is it time and a half or double?  Well, I say double.  You know what I mean?  17 minutes over yesterday means 34 minutes early today. 
[00:16:30]  Now we're down to 926 plus the five-minute phone call.  921, I get to get out of here.  Nice.  I don't think so.  Nice.  I like it.  So what happened yesterday after the show?  It sounded like pandemonium when I was driving home listening to the shit hour.  So we rocked piss because we exposed his fake sick day.  Yeah.  We exposed that he was going to the Conan on his fake sick day.  And we woke him up at 6.13 and bothered him most of the morning.  No, no, no. 
[00:17:00]  There's a giant thing that you're leaving out that he's pissed off about.  You rock's belly?  Oh, come on.  The poor kid's having a bad day.  He said a giant thing.  No.  I was not right.  I'm going to guess.  It's the Iraq character I talk about.  It's the other thing.  Not the real Iraq.  Yeah, you're leaving out the...  What?  You exposed his...  I didn't do shit!  You exposed his lie.  I didn't do shit.  Now, that was the big sort of...  I didn't do shit.  I mean, that's a lot bigger than, you know, everybody takes a fake sick day.  I couldn't live with the lie anymore.  I think, right, Derek? 
[00:17:30]  I couldn't live with the lie anymore.  I couldn't live with it anymore.  I couldn't live with myself.  Is that what it was?  Knowing I was lying to this fine company.  That's not the case.  That's not the case.  You couldn't live with yourself?  I couldn't live with myself.  Yeah.  I didn't do shit!  Either that, or it was 920, you didn't like anything in front of you, so instead of calling  my mom and saying horrible things, you exposed one of Eric's lies.  You just...  For some reason...  Why does it bounce off you, but Eric gets pissed at everybody?  We basically called your mom the C-word. 
[00:18:00]  Not basically, you did.  All right.  Because you literally...  I've come downplayed a little bit.  There's no reason to.  And you're fine with it, and your mom's fine with it.  I realized that part of...  But all hell's breaking loose now, because E-Rock is pissed off!  For some reason, at around 920-ish, if you don't like anything in front of you, you  decide it's time to make one of the staff members' lives much more complicated.  Well, we kind of have done that in the past, sure.  Yeah.  If I worked for this show, like behind the scenes, at 920, I would just disappear. 
[00:18:30]  If you hear one of us go, you know what, I don't like anything else in front of us.  Yeah, and unfortunately...  I would just leave the building.  E-Rock tried the disappearing thing, and it didn't work.  Why?  Because he wasn't here, and look what happened.  Yeah, he was, and he did disappear.  It wasn't like he was here tap-dancing on the console, and like, all right, you...  But that means you turn your phones off and everything.  Well, I mean, that time he...  Just get off the grid.  Just get off the grid, man.  You still would have brought him up.  Just remember, I didn't do shit.  I couldn't live with the lie anymore.  That's a tough burden to walk through life with. 
[00:19:00]  That's what Eric is bothered by, I believe.  Roland?  The biggest part is the fact that E-Rock did take the day.  To go to Conan O'Brien.  But we found out later, yes, that he indeed was supposed to go to Conan O'Brien taping  with Roland.  Now, there was a lot of stuff going back and forth.  Oh, my God.  Different issues got raised.  It changed from that.  It was like the Ducati Park thing.  But...  What was Zucati Park?  What happened yesterday now? 
[00:19:30]  Did E-Rock end up going to Conan?  No.  Oh.  Now, why?  Look, I thought in the after show, he said he didn't want to go anymore.  What did he just say?  I thought an actress was one...  Like, he said something about an actress.  No, I thought he said he didn't want to go anymore on the after show, like saying he  could go by himself.  So my friend heard and said, hey, I'll take the tickets.  So I went, okay.  But you and E-Rock are supposed to be friends.  Oh, you gave his tickets away without even confirming with him live, just based on what 
[00:20:00]  you heard on the radio?  Yeah.  Well, they're my tickets, though.  It was all lies.  It's way worse than exposing lies.  Yes.  I'm sorry.  I'm going to say this.  It's way worse.  This is terrible.  He was looking forward to the Conan thing.  Obi, you and I claim to be friends with E-Rock and do horrible things with him to his face  and say nasty things.  I feel like Roland and Troy, they do things, too, but they're not so open about it.  They're real friends, I guess. 
[00:20:30]  They, like, hang out.  You eat with E-Rock and all that.  Yeah.  You go to, like, all these, like, nerdy geek things with him.  Yeah.  But my buddy goes, hey, if you want to go, I'll use them.  Hit a day off.  I'm like, all right.  Why would you do that to E-Rock, though?  Why wouldn't you let him calm down?  Because he had a tough morning.  I don't know.  I just have a limited time to do this, book that.  So I was just like, all right, go.  So I went there.  How do you give away his tickets?  That's kind of crazy.  That's fucking, like, without talking to him in person and asking, hey, when you said 
[00:21:00]  on the radio, hey, E-Rock, can you still go?  And he'd go, yeah, I can still go.  And you'd go, okay, I'll see you there.  Not like, oh, he said on the radio, he can't go.  Let me give these away.  That's crazy.  Wow.  But they were my tickets to begin with.  Yeah, but if you gave it away and said you were giving it to him, technically, it's his ticket  now.  And don't tell me you're not going to go, because then I'd go, okay, bye.  He didn't tell you he wasn't going to go.  No, he just said it on the radio.  At what time did he say he wasn't going?  Nine something, or I don't know.  There were text messages also, right, Roland? 
[00:21:30]  Well, he said, well, one or two, because he said, asshole.  E-Rock, do you believe that whatever was said would have led Roland to believe that you weren't  going to go?  I think I said once in the heat of everything, no, no, I'm not going.  But he didn't bother to say, oh, are you really not going, or respond when I said, are you  still going?  Now, you didn't want to go, right?  You texted him?  Yeah, I asked him, and he didn't respond.  And why, Roland?  You got mad at something he texted? 
[00:22:00]  No, I was like, fine.  I was like, I'm busy.  If one of my buddies text me, hey, you're not going to go, I'll use the tickets.  I'm like, all right, go, have fun.  Then I went over there to you.  Why would you give E-Rock just an hour to calm down?  Yeah, yeah.  He really ate a shit sandwich yesterday.  Yeah, he did.  A couple of them.  Well, you guys actually got tickets and took them.  No, you promised.  You already committed a ticket.  To E-Rock, yeah.  Yeah.  My bad.  My bad. 
[00:22:30]  It just boils down to my bad.  I don't think E-Rock's going to accept my bad today.  That's one of the greatest cop-out answers ever.  Hey, my bad.  E-Rock's not going to accept the my bad.  No, I don't think so.  Sometimes you can accept the my bad, but not today.  It was Lucy K. in the gay wedding, so.  The Lucy K.?  Lucy K. was a guest.  Oh, I thought it was like Lucy.  I thought they said Lucy K.  Yeah, I thought it was a porn star or something.  Lucy K.  Lucy K.  And Conan married one of his staff members.  Conan married one of the staff members?  Yeah.  He acted as the officiator. 
[00:23:00]  Is he allowed to do that?  Wait, did he do a hack gay wedding?  Yep.  Yeah, it's all over the internet today.  But that's hack.  Thank you, Conan.  Conan, I've had you forever in your debt.  Fuck, Conan!  Nice to be married!  Stupid fuck.  Stop doing hack radio bits.  We do the hack radio bits.  Yeah, leave it to us.  We went over there, got my friends in, they came back.  No, we never married a gay couple.  We would never marry a gay couple.  Ew.  It's stupid.  Did someone marry a gay couple?  Oh, hey! 
[00:23:30]  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Yeah, but when Ronnie does it, it's cool.  Yeah, who was it?  I don't remember.  Fuck, did I just say that?  Fuck.  Didn't my sister do it?  Officiated?  Really?  Fuck, I mean, yes.  I have no idea.  God damn it, I don't want Ronnie on my fucking...  I don't know!  So, um...  Eric didn't believe him that he'd given away the tickets.  And did Eric show up here?  Like, let's get into this, man. 
[00:24:00]  We're wasting time, Sam.  Yeah, what happened?  We went home.  I heard the radio, that's why I called him, because A-Rock and Troy were going at it big  time, and then I learned later on that Roland blew off his pal A-Rock, said, fuck you,  and then got another friend to go to Conan.  Well, I didn't go, I just got him and my buddy and his friend in.  You didn't even go?  You just gave away all the tickets?  Yeah.  But you wanted to go.  To me?  I said a million TV tapings.  But you said yesterday you wanted to go.  I did, but I was like, eh, it's alright, I'll just get other people in if they want to 
[00:24:30]  go, there they go, VIP tickets to enjoy.  So why wouldn't you just give those two tickets to A-Rock?  Where were you?  I needed that voice of reason.  Voice of reason?  Yeah.  What happened?  Where is that?  I don't know.  You know where A-Rock was?  Where?  At the Beacon Theater.  Wait, what?  Wait, what?  What happened?  Because I think he probably thought I was joking.  Which I do do that.  Oh, no.  And he went down looking for you? 
[00:25:00]  Well, no, Roland never told me that he did something with the tickets.  Because he never responded to it.  No, I did text you.  I said, since you didn't want to go, I'm going to give it to my friend.  And then that was the last.  No, you sent it to my corporate email.  I think Roland pulled the scumbaggiest move out of everybody yesterday.  I'm off the hook.  I just couldn't live with the lies anymore.  I didn't do shit.  Roland.  But that's a dick move, Roland.  That's pretty dastardly.  Oh, I wonder where I learned that from.  Don't say you learned it from me. 
[00:25:30]  Get the fuck out of here.  This environment is toxic.  It is.  So, Iraq, you went down to the Beacon Theater?  Well, first.  I mean, Eric was here because he thought Roland was here.  So, Eric.  He had to come into the building.  And, you know, obviously Eric, after yesterday, didn't want to come into the building.  He came in.  No, I actually, I did come in.  But I came to get something out of my desk.  Was it your medicine?  Go ahead.  Where is this going?  Because you didn't feel good. 
[00:26:00]  That was all.  That was the end.  It was a period.  Not a semicolon.  I think he didn't disagree with the fake sick day thing.  But, I mean.  I can't officially say that.  But we all have done it.  Inter-Matt ratted him out.  Because, I don't know.  I mean, Inter-Matt watched him.  He didn't rat me out.  He said, what are you doing here?  I said, I'm getting something out of my desk.  No, he told me.  And he goes, and ran out of the room.  He told me.  And, again, Inter-Matt could be lying.  But he told me that you went in there and said, hey, is Roland here?  Where's Roland?  And then he said, I don't know. 
[00:26:30]  Are you not going to Conan?  And you said, oh, yes, I am.  And then you did get something out of your desk and left.  But he made it seem like.  I mean, I wasn't there.  But, Intern-Matt made it seem like.  Yeah, Matt came in after the fact.  I was saying the poo-poo.  I was already in there doing stuff.  What was in your desk that you needed?  I got my charger and my camera.  Oh.  Why, are you hoping to meet some people?  No, I just didn't want to leave it here.  Oh, the camera.  You wanted to bring it to the Conan table.  Oh, you got it.  I don't blame you.  I don't blame you.  Maybe get a couple pictures.  Maybe sit a little high at a Conan picture.  Yeah. 
[00:27:00]  It was a big deal yesterday.  A lot of celebrities were checking out the Conan thing, right?  Yeah.  So, then you went to the Beacon Theater, assuming that Roland knew that, of course, you would go.  Right?  Well, I had no idea, because he never responded.  So, I figured, you know what?  I'm going to go there and see if he's standing out there.  Wow.  The next time they say, I'm not going to go there, I just go, argh, I'm mad.  That's whatever he said.  Yeah.  Got him.  And so, then you just gave your tickets to another friend of yours?  Yeah.  They both enjoyed it.  They had a great time. 
[00:27:30]  They met Conan and all that.  Oh, and also, Roland.  Roland is evil, man.  Yeah.  You want to know how evil Roland is?  Roland is fucking evil, man.  I wouldn't want to fuck with him.  And he was, and this is, you know, public, but he was Instagramming photos from the outside  of the Conan.  Like, hey, check it out.  Yeah.  Yeah, we're here.  He's going to say, look where I am.  And taking pictures of the Conan VIP line and the whatever.  The one Iroch would have been on.  Yeah, that's right.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's right.  So, Iroch, you went to the Beacon Theater. 
[00:28:00]  Did you run into Roland?  Yeah, Roland was waiting outside.  Yeah, for my friends.  And you said, hey.  He was waiting outside for his other friends.  And you said to Roland, hey, can I get the ticket?  And he said, they're gone.  And he said, are you kidding me?  I was like, no.  This is so fucked up.  That is really fucking just torture.  Yeah.  Iroch assumed that, of course, he's gone because he never heard from you.  So, he shows up at the Beacon Theater, runs into Roland, going, oh, Roland's here.  Okay, we're going to now go into Conan. 
[00:28:30]  But no, Roland's there because he wants to give his tickets to other friends of his.  This is like the time Eric thought I took his money.  Yeah.  Except it's as if I didn't have it at my desk the entire time.  Like, at the end of it, I was like, okay, here you go.  I was just.  Right.  But there was no.  There was no payoff.  Opening up the desk drawer.  Yeah.  So, what did Iroch say to you?  He's like, are you kidding me?  I was like, no.  And then, finally, my friends came down.  I was like, I gotta check him in.  Did Iroch watch you give the tickets to your friend?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  What? 
[00:29:00]  But once you realized he was there, why did you just tell your friends that there's been  a mistake?  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah, because they were Irochs.  Yeah, there's one ticket down.  I'm sorry.  No.  Roland's not being honest.  There's some animosity there.  Iroch did something.  That's it.  Yeah, what happened?  Where Roland said, fuck you.  This is a fuck you right to his face.  Yeah.  My friend, he does.  I was like, I told him they wanted to go.  So, I was like, all right.  They go.  They didn't say no.  But you already promised to take us to Iroch. 
[00:29:30]  I never told him no.  Damn.  He said no.  He wanted to go on air.  So, once I hear that, I'm like, all right.  And then, my friends go, I heard on air, somebody didn't want to go.  Can I use them?  I'm like, yeah.  Something's not right.  Something.  There's a piece that's missing.  Yeah.  Roland's not even really looking over to you.  Yeah.  At Iroch.  Why are you really mad at Iroch?  I'm not mad.  Iroch, do you know why he's mad at you?  No, and I asked him, like, straight to his face.  I'm like, what's the problem?  Why did you give these tickets away?  Oh, no, I thought you didn't go.  I mean, that's all he kept saying. 
[00:30:00]  So, what was I supposed to do?  That's the answer I got.  Roland's very, I don't know what it is, but Roland is, like, very, has a short fuse, and  he's spiteful in moments.  And then, you know, I asked him, too.  I'm like, what did I say or do that you're pissed off?  Nothing, nothing, nothing.  There is, there has to be, like.  So, I said, okay.  I took him, I took him at his word, but.  There's, like, some little thing that Eric said that bothered Roland, and I'm sure he's  over it now, but at the time, I think.  I don't know.  Yeah, no, once I take my morning shit, I'm happy.  So, what was it that bothered you that he said? 
[00:30:30]  Yeah, because you obviously.  Because Iroch was just getting attacked on the air yesterday.  Yeah, you obviously gave him a fuck you yesterday.  And then, Eric, what happened after that?  Were you fucking pissed?  Well, what could I do?  You know, I mean, I was aggravated because he hadn't responded to me.  Until he just said right now, you know, no, I told you I was giving him to my friend,  but he sent it to my work email.  And I had my phone with me, so I didn't.  You sent me a Gmail.  You sent me an email.  Should I go in to my Gmail? 
[00:31:00]  And I wrote back, no, because I'm giving it to my friends.  I hit send.  So, you sent.  So, Eric sent you an email saying.  To my Gmail.  Should I just go inside?  No, no.  He said, should I come in the city?  I wouldn't know.  I already gave out the tickets.  Why didn't you just text me, Rock?  I did.  He didn't text me back.  How come you didn't text him back?  Why didn't you text him back?  That?  Oh, I had to meet with Annabella because she was taking vacation time for different guests.  Two seconds to text back.  Yeah.  Come on.  Like, if you knew he was trying to come into the city, why wouldn't you just go, no, 
[00:31:30]  I gave him away?  Oh, I'm sorry.  Hearts of gold.  Um, yes.  Come on.  Come on now.  Really, guys?  Yeah, really?  I would text back.  Oh, please.  Somebody writes bad.  Ah, fuck them.  Hearts of gold.  Yeah, something's going on with Roland today, man.  There is so much anger in Roland.  Something's going on, man.  Now he's attacking all of us.  No.  I'm just upset.  I'm just upset.  I'm just going on with Roland, man.  Roland's an angry man.  He doesn't like being questioned.  Like, it's like an animal.  Like, you put him in a corner.  Yeah.  And he's going to start lashing out.  He's getting cornered, yeah. 
[00:32:00]  So, E-Rock, you know what this is about.  He don't give a shit.  E-Rock, tell us what this is about.  I don't know what this is.  Did you call him an asshole or something?  What'd he say?  Honey Roland's a fuck.  He don't give a shit.  No, because that's what...  Look at this crazy fuck.  Because we say, because I don't want to go, and then he texts me, enjoy, asshole.  So, I assume that means...  That was when you were piling on with everybody else on the air is when that text was sent.  So, when he came in and doing his...  He was laughing hysterically at one point from what I was hearing on the phone. 
[00:32:30]  That's hilarious.  So, I wrote, oh, enjoy, asshole.  Meaning, enjoy all of this with everybody else.  Meaning, enjoy, asshole.  That would be a normal...  Two words.  That would be a normal response to hearing someone laughing uncontrollably.  At you, yes.  At you.  At you.  Well, didn't you mention Conan, too?  Who gave up that he was going to Conan?  Roland.  Roland did.  Roland did.  Okay, yeah.  So, E-Rock was mad that you gave him up on the air, probably.  Yeah.  And then Roland says, well, fuck that.  Yeah.  He didn't call me an asshole, fuck you. 
[00:33:00]  Yeah, I'm going to give the ticket to somebody else now.  Wow, but E-Rock shows up, and Roland's there waiting for the other guy.  He'll be back next year, Conan.  He'll be back.  E-Rock, you must be furious.  Yeah, E-Rock.  Furious.  What am I going to do?  I'm not saying you should pick up an axe.  I'm just saying you must be furious.  There's got to be some animosity now towards Roland here, right?  Your pal, Roland.  That is what it is, so.  It is what it is, which is some anger.  You're a better man than me.  Maybe even hurt feelings, kind of like I thought.  I don't know what a fucking mind.  I thought that takes it from, all right, we're goofing around here on the show, to that's real. 
[00:33:30]  Like, that is a visceral, real thing you took away from him.  I think Eric would be more mad if somebody else did this.  You think?  Why?  Why isn't he mad at Roland?  Yeah.  What does Roland have on him?  This is just my, I just.  Roland got on you, E-Rock.  I did nothing.  Roland does favors for people.  Bless you, Kenny.  Thank you.  And if you're mad at Roland, it becomes more difficult for certain favors to get done.  Oh, so it's politically motivated.  I don't know.  It's just.  What kind of favors you mean? 
[00:34:00]  Involving celebrity guests.  Sexual?  Moral?  Things like, and in case, you know.  E-Rock's in a tough spot.  If tickets come up again, let's say, for another thing, Roland is the hookup guy, and if E-Rock  is really pissed at Roland, Roland's not going to hook him up next to him.  So you're saying don't bite the hand that shovels food into your craw.  So basically, E-Rock wants to be mad at Roland, but can't because Roland's his hookup, and  he snapped at Roland, so Roland just kind of took away this particular bait.  Like if Troy or me or Danny or any of us had done something like this, and Eric would 
[00:34:30]  be thinking of ways to make our lives difficult.  Is that true, Roland?  Yeah.  That's my theory.  I don't know.  You were making a power move yesterday, huh?  No.  It's just someone texted me, hey, I want to go.  I'm like, all right.  They're excited to see Conan, so I figure.  But E-Rock was still excited.  He was just in a bad place.  He was punishing Eric for that text.  Yeah, he was in a bad place.  We all get in a bad place sometimes.  But now we learn from our mistakes. 
[00:35:00]  Oh, shit.  Learn from our mistakes?  Wow.  You rule with an iron fist there.  And E-Rock just sits there.  Why do you just sit there, Eric?  What the fuck am I going to say?  He fucked you over.  Say something to him.  Keep this going.  I already talked to him about it yesterday.  We dealt with it.  Hey, what's the world coming to?  It was a dick move.  Yeah, there were a lot of dick moves yesterday.  I didn't do shit.  I couldn't live with the lies anymore.  Yeah.  That's a lie again.  I didn't do shit. 
[00:35:30]  You're not mad at Edgar, are you?  Edgar.  Oh, no, no, no, no.  E-Rock, this is a little self-serving and shit, but I just want to know, did I do anything  yesterday that kind of perpetuated this or fucked with it?  Of course you didn't do anything.  You didn't start anything.  But he did pile on, didn't he?  Well, that's what this show does.  Yeah, I know.  But after the show, when we're all done, I didn't cram a big crowbar.  You don't acknowledge that I exist after the show.  Oh, shit.  Wow.  I think I do.  You don't really.  I don't say that in a bad way. 
[00:36:00]  At this point, I don't really acknowledge anyone that exists.  But I kind of run out of here is what it is.  Yeah.  I still get nailed by fucking frickin' frack walking down the goddamn hallway.  At this point, you're better off not.  I mean, with the way E-Rock's been acknowledged over the past couple days, you're probably,  I think he meant that in a good way.  You don't acknowledge me after the show, so you're fine.  Because it seems like everyone that does acknowledge you after the show, it's something bad.  Yeah.  But I, you know, I wouldn't have done anything real like that. 
[00:36:30]  Roland looks fucking evil and pissed off.  Roland is an evil man.  Evil man.  Are you tired?  Yeah, that's all.  You know what?  Roland has a bit of power sometimes in tickets and other things, and he likes wielding that  power, I think.  Nothing wrong with that.  If you're, you know, like Hitler.  My Fuhrer.  My Fuhrer.  Steiner.  Oh, man.  All right.  I would have gave you E-Rock an hour or two. 
[00:37:00]  Yeah.  Cool down, maybe.  Yeah, because it was a rough day.  That text really made you mad when you say that text.  That's obvious.  No, not really.  I'm just like, okay.  It doesn't piss me off.  I'm like, okay, no problem.  I could have a lot of shit to do.  So I'm like, all right, next.  But you guys were going to go together, right?  Yeah.  And then, yeah.  For some reason, he got really mad at E-Rock.  Yeah.  There's something else here.  Yeah.  Because you didn't waste any time finding someone else for those tickets.  Yeah.  No, just my friends here on the show.  They're like, I'll take them.  Wouldn't you, I'm just saying, because I'm kind of scared right now of this guy. 
[00:37:30]  He's a lunatic.  But wouldn't you, okay, E-Rock says he's not going.  But logically, wouldn't you go, okay, he took a lot of shit this morning.  I'm going to give him an hour to calm down.  Then you get this other option where you could give the tickets to your friends.  So wouldn't at that point you call E-Rock and go, were you serious about not going?  Yeah, you got to give him the benefit of the doubt.  That's good.  That's good.  Next time I remember that one.  You got to give him the benefit of the doubt.  But that doesn't even come into your head?  Nah.  As a thought process?  Nah, my head's like, all right, scratch off, next. 
[00:38:00]  Because he was getting beat up on the air, and then you said he was going to Conan.  It's not like he did something that outed that he was going to Conan.  Oh, yeah.  You mentioned that he was going to Conan.  So he was kind of pissed off, probably like, fuck, these guys are blowing me up all day.  Oh, yeah.  Did anything that happened yesterday put E-Rock in a position where he even irked you a little bit?  Irked me?  Oh.  I think so.  Of course it did.  I don't know why it's different today.  I don't know why it's different today.  Was there anything that you could think of that hit you the wrong way as far as E-Rock's concerned  that made it that much easier for you to pull the ticket and not acknowledge him? 
[00:38:30]  What did he do that really bothered you?  No, just probably when someone said, hey, I'm not going to go.  I'm like, all right.  And then that was it.  I'm like, okay, don't go.  When someone said they want to go, I just got to find him.  It's the same thing.  Nah, but that was punishment.  And it's our job to try to get it out of him, but for some reason he's not.  If you think that somebody doesn't want to go, if you're like, I really thought he didn't  want to go.  But that wasn't the case here.  That's what I'm saying.  Yeah.  Eric was just fucking wound up.  And even now he's like, you know, well, he said, do you want to go?  I didn't get a ticket to him.  But it's not like, oh, you know, maybe I should have waited longer. 
[00:39:00]  He's just like, fuck it.  Like there seems to be this underlying little thing that isn't being brought out.  Obviously, everyone, Eric was wound up and you probably would give him an hour to see  where he's at.  Just an hour.  Yeah.  You didn't even wait five minutes.  I waited 20.  You waited 20?  Yeah.  For him to get back to you?  No, no.  I was taking a shit and then I had a lot of stuff to do.  But you know, that's not waiting.  That's not saying I'm going to give him 20 minutes.  It's like I'm doing stuff.  And then when I'm done, when you give someone 20 minutes, they have to know you're giving 
[00:39:30]  them 20 minutes, meaning you have to like call or text and go, OK, were you serious  about what you said?  It would have been easy for you to to coordinate the fact that Eric wanted to go and you still  had the tickets.  It would have been simple through through text.  Next time I ask Siri.  It's hard to believe something else is up.  Yeah, of course.  But yeah, only because he texted you and you didn't get back to him on text.  Like you knew that he wanted to.  Eric, does this sound logical to you?  What he did?  But you're not going to get a different. 
[00:40:00]  No, but you're not going to get a different answer from them.  I know that.  Because when I asked, I was face to face with him and I was asking him and this is what  I got.  So what do you think it is?  I don't know because I didn't talk about him or to him on the phone yesterday with all  this.  Roland wasn't on the mic or anything like that.  So, I mean, I didn't say anything to him.  I don't know.  It's weird.  People don't act like this like without something going on.  Yeah, I think so.  How come you didn't text him back?  I don't know. 
[00:40:30]  I was busy.  Have you booked for the Hard Rock show?  No, no, no.  I have to stress.  These guys are friends.  They hang out a lot outside the show.  So, it's not like a little acquaintance where I can maybe understand that.  You guys have developed a relationship to a point where I would assume you would have  wrote him.  Yeah, but yesterday, they asked me for a lot of bookings for the Hard Rock and all of that.  So, I focused in on that.  I have no idea.  Something about Hard Rock and yesterday.  I got it.  He was booking guests for the Hard Rock. 
[00:41:00]  So, he was focused on that.  Oh, I've been rolling in a library.  Yep, that's it.  Okay.  You speak Roland fluently.  Yes.  Yes, me and Roland have had many a conversation.  So, I've learned.  Yeah.  All right.  I don't know.  We're not getting anything.  I know.  I want to ask you again, but I know what the answer is going to be.  It's like watching First 48 where the guy.  Jimmy, you try.  Won't crack.  Jimmy, you try.  One more.  I thought it was a work at first.  Yeah.  That they went together and they're just goofing.  No.  The first I did.  No, no.  I saw Roland here.  No, no.  The first I did.  Yeah. 
[00:41:30]  This reminds me of in a relationship when one does something wrong and the other one's  like, no, no.  That's fine.  Just go with your friends.  Go ahead.  And then it comes out later.  It always comes out later.  It'll come out whatever it was.  I guess you had to wait.  I'm fine.  No, that was a bit.  It was.  I'm not saying in your mind you'd have a reason to do it, but because Iraq was his home doing  what he would normally be doing here, which is just relaxing.  Oh, my God.  You're kidding, Iraq.  Oh, shit. 
[00:42:00]  And everyone started throwing him under the bus.  He wasn't like he was here and he was fucking with you.  And then you came in and said that he was going on to Conan or whatever.  So it was almost like everyone was piling on him.  And so if he just responded and called you an asshole, like, why would you get mad at that  for real?  Especially when he texted you after that.  Are we rational people of us now?  Hold on.  No, this is it.  Hold on.  Dennis in Pennsylvania.  Dennis, go ahead.  Yeah.  At one point yesterday in the after show or shit show.  After show.  You're right the first time.  Okay. 
[00:42:30]  The after show.  Roland said that he just received a text from Iraq calling me an asshole.  And then Roland said on mic, he said, all I have to say is I forgive you.  And then he gave his evil, sinister Roland laugh.  Yeah.  That asshole thing.  Yeah.  That you're kind of downplaying got to you somehow.  Yep.  That could be it.  Yeah.  That could be the sticky wicket.  Yeah.  If that was a fuck you, you're like, really?  Okay.  Well, watch what I do now.  And that's why you can't be furious or mad at Roland because he doesn't like it when 
[00:43:00]  that happens.  So it's like if you want to ask, and I guess that's Roland's prerogative.  But everything that Iraq was going through yesterday, he writes asshole, that's normal.  It was lashing out.  That's normal.  In all directions.  I mean, if Roland blew up his spot and then had that evil fucking laugh that we all love.  If they were going to Conan today, probably would have been fine because Roland would  have been over it.  But in that moment, Roland doesn't like it.  He gets heated and he said, well, if you're going to call me an asshole, then why would  I do a favor for you?  But it wasn't like Iraq had no reason to. 
[00:43:30]  It wasn't like Iraq called up and said, you piece of shit, like that.  It was just a silly reaction to blowing his spot up on the air.  Are we more accurate now, Roland?  Yeah, I don't know.  I'm fine.  Roland gave that laugh like, oh, look what I'm going to do to you now.  Yeah.  Yeah, there was an evil laugh in there like, oh boy, I got some power that I'm going to...  And then Iraq, you're such a...  You used to getting beat up, but you're actually going like, what did I do wrong?  Instead of going, hey man, I was just, you know... 
[00:44:00]  That's like if me and Bobby had that happen, me and Bob Kelly.  It's like if you guys are buddies, I wouldn't just leave my friend and punish him like that.  Unless he did something so fucked up.  That is a punishment.  Very good you said that.  You punished him for something.  Yeah.  Watch it now, boys.  All right, man.  All right, let's say hi to Kevin in New Hampshire.  Kevin.  All right, guys.  Can we move on here?  I mean, who gives a fuck, really?  I mean, it's like fucking listening to Jersey Shore here.  All these little girls' bitches.  Oh.  Well, we have to get to the bottom of it, sir.  We are very curious. 
[00:44:30]  Dude, what should we talk about?  You give us a topic.  Go.  I don't know.  I didn't get a chance to watch the news this morning.  That's your job.  Come on, guys.  We're newscasters.  This is the news, sir.  What's your job?  What do you do, character?  I work on cars for a living.  Really?  Why aren't you under a fucking car right now changing the oil?  I'm on my way to work right now.  What are you doing?  Why aren't you there right now?  What the fuck's wrong with you?  You should get in early and fucking fix someone's car.  You know what?  Someone's going to come to get their car, and it's not going to be done yet because  of fucking lazy cock like you isn't at work yet. 
[00:45:00]  Get it?  I love you guys.  We hate you.  We hate you.  Yeah, we're going to get to the bottom of this, sir.  This is...  Just go to your second life.  I hope the lift falls on his throat.  We don't have to deal with ratings anymore, so if you don't like what we're talking about,  you go to your secondary channel.  We all have our secondary channel.  Go there.  That's the Jersey Shore.  We started talking about...  The most highly rated show there is.  We started talking about Wall Street.  What about Al Q?  Just kind of...  That's where he wants to go.  It's secondary.  Phones are lit.  But it's usually a pretty good sign.  Yeah. 
[00:45:30]  And someone...  Finley in Manhattan, Iraq, saying that officially you did not take a sick day yesterday because  you were on the show a lot.  And he was in the building.  And he was in the building.  So don't count that sick day.  That's right.  I was just really late.  He was really late.  Is that it with this thing?  We're not really going to get all the info.  I'm sure in weeks, months, and years to come, this will be uncovered.  Big conspiracy.  Hmm. 
[00:46:00]  Yeah.  There's something else going on.  Yeah.  But Iraq accepts it, and they're probably friends again.  Right?  Yeah, I'm fine.  I have no...  I'm not having no anger towards anybody.  You should be fine.  You weren't...  Yeah.  You weren't standing out in the cold outside...  Where was it?  The Beacon Theater.  It was a nice day, though.  Like a bombing 70 degrees.  Are you...  Are you angry, Iraq?  I'm upset about it?  Yeah.  Iraq's also more angry about other things, I think.  I didn't do shit.  I couldn't live with lies. 
[00:46:30]  I didn't say anything.  What's he more angry with?  Oh, the after show?  The voice track, you think?  Yes.  I think so.  I get it.  I don't know.  I haven't talked to him, but yes, I think so.  Iraq?  Are you mad about that?  Sure.  Why?  Why do you think?  I don't know.  Dude, I didn't know.  First of all, I didn't know that you guys didn't voice track that until yesterday.  I have no idea.  I don't care if you do or don't.  I'm just curious.  Well, it didn't need to be brought up, but whatever. 
[00:47:00]  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Iraq is the best.  I'm a Christian man.  I couldn't live with the lice.  Did you talk to him yesterday?  Nope.  Oh, he knows.  That question was meant for Opie, by the way.  But you jumped in and answered that one.  He was walking around in my neighborhood because he had nothing to do because fucking Roland  left him outside.  Did you guys see each other?  So he happened to be in my neighborhood, and then he writes me, but I really was very  busy yesterday.  Oh. 
[00:47:30]  I had the kid all day, and my wife was extremely busy.  And I did say that I would get back to him, and I usually do write Iraq, but I didn't  yesterday, so he's now met at me as well.  Yeah.  I can see that.  Psh.  That's a dick move.  Oof.  Not as bad as yours, sir.  Touche.  I gotta give you that.  That's a pretty dicky move, but I'm not in it or involved, so I don't give a shit.  Where's Troy?  However you want to roll, Roland.  But you started the Fez controversy.  I didn't do nothing.  Who started the someone cried over the whipping clip? 
[00:48:00]  Well, we started playing it yesterday, and then I brought up the fact that some people  get very upset when they watch something, which is horrible.  We watched it, and we were like, holy shit, that's pretty fucking bad.  But other people might get a little more upset than others.  It's just natural.  So then Fezzy should have taken a shot at you and not me.  Well, the fuck?  Was he really?  I thought that was a joke on Twitter.  I never know it's a joke.  That wasn't a joke.  I'm done with it.  Fezzy gets all pissed off at me, even though Ant started, and then we all kind of piled on.  And then I was like, enough already, because in the end, we said that we completely understood 
[00:48:30]  why Fezzy would get upset with that clip, but I didn't hear that part, conveniently.  Well, I talked to Fezzy about the clip itself when he was coming in, and I was leaving yesterday.  Well, he could have talked to me.  I walked right by him.  He gave me a nice smile and a, hey, how are you?  He had a problem with me.  He could have fucking stopped me.  Did you stop and chat?  I said hi to him.  Well, hi isn't a stop and chat.  You don't stop and chat with anyone.  I stopped and chat with Fez.  You stopped and chat?  Yeah, I stopped and chat with Fez.  We talked about the clip and how awful it was, and Fuzz's comebacks, and shit like that. 
[00:49:00]  Hard to watch.  Yeah.  You should get the whole story.  And the whole story was that we actually sided with him and understood.  I laughed, because somebody had written that Fez got mad because some listener called in.  Right.  That's what a funny thing for the listener to say, and the listener goes, oh, you know, she  had it coming because she was being disobedient.  That's just what a funny thing to say.  It's so wrong.  It's so fucking wrong.  Yeah.  That's just a funny thing for a guy to say to annoy someone.  She's disobedient. 
[00:49:30]  Yeah.  I guess we'll never really get to the bottom of this.  Iraq, have a cupcake.  They're good.  I had to have the chocolate chip with that.  It's amazing.  You want a cupcake?  Oh, fuck.  They're not even cupcakes.  They're little mini pies, right?  Oh, God, dude.  Roland, have a cupcake.  It's better.  Iraq, you have one first.  Poor Eric.  It's kind of uncomfortable in here now.  A little bit.  I don't like to see Eric on that.  Eric's sad.  We're not asking if you're okay. 
[00:50:00]  You weren't the one that got beat up yesterday.  Beat up and then he got his tickets jacked.  Right.  Roland goes, I'm okay.  Roland says he's okay.  I'm okay.  Of course you're okay.  He's the one that took the tickets.  That's like the rapist saying to the police, no, no, no.  She just scratched me a little.  I'm all right.  Don't worry.  I'm all right.  You kind of escalated this whole thing.  Granted, we started it, but wow, you didn't make it any easier or better in the end.  But he's okay.  Thank God Roland's okay.  Good thing. 
[00:50:30]  The reason I was asking about Troy is, does he know what's going on or no?  Any more than anybody else?  I don't know.  What was the big Troy-Iraq controversy?  Because I heard yelling as I was driving, but I couldn't even figure out what the fuck  these two were pissed at each other about.  It just always boils down to the same thing with those two, because Eric just goes, why  don't you just pay attention to you and let me do me?  Because Troy first starts saying, I have a problem with this aspect, and then he just  can't get on the E-Rock conversation without attacking every part of E-Rock's being. 
[00:51:00]  I hear from people also, they call up or tweet shit like, hey, is Troy E-Rock's boss?  Because if he isn't, he should shut the fuck up.  That's the consensus that I've talked to from people, too.  But yeah, that's where that was, and E-Rock still was telling Troy that he was in love  with him.  That was funny, actually.  That was pretty goddamn funny.  E-Rock's got weird friendships around here.  Yeah. 
[00:51:30]  Because he's close with Troy and close with Roland.  But the two guys that fuck him over the most.  Why do people resent E-Rock?  Jealous.  Pretty cool, huh?  I don't know.  But what is it?  He's a nice guy.  I'd be jealous in the boat.  I think E-Rock's...  Born and raised in Florida.  He's a thoughtful guy.  Long Island.  Wherever.  He's a very thoughtful guy, E-Rock.  He is.  He's a sensitive boy.  He is, but he's thoughtful.  Yes.  Like, he'll do these little weird things you don't expect.  Like, when we were going to meet stupid Carol Burnett, he bought me a Carol Burnett book,  and I gave him the money.  He's like, in case you wanted to sign it.  He's a thoughtful guy.  Did he throw it in the sewer? 
[00:52:00]  I said, who wants this, you fucking asshole?  I spit in his face, and I left him outside when I met Carol by myself.  With another friend.  But he's just, you know...  But people get bugged by him.  I don't know why.  I don't know either.  I mean, Troy has said that it's from working with him.  Maybe that's if you work with somebody closely for hours.  I don't know.  Is Troy here?  Yeah, he's supposed to be.  Unless he's sick.  Maybe we should move on.  Is he doing Pilates?  Where is he?  If he gets in here, it's another fucking half hour of this shit. 
[00:52:30]  How about we give Troy one minute?  Because he might know more of what's going on.  I'm just curious.  See, but Roland's saying no.  So Roland's saying no.  That means there's something there.  Not really.  And I truly believe that even if Roland and Eric had had a great time at Conan yesterday,  Eric would not have come to work much happier today.  Yeah.  I don't think he's...  Well, he is here.  And from yesterday's phone calls, I heard him saying that he didn't know if he was coming  in today.  Someone thinks this is a hack bit.  Yes, we made it up.  It's not a bit.  We're just talking about what happened to work. 
[00:53:00]  That's the beauty of this show.  It's hack real.  This shit is real.  Dan and Greenville.  How do we know this isn't an intricate hack bit that's been planned out over two weeks?  Dude, I seriously suck for two weeks planning?  I literally thought that they were joking at first.  I'm like, nah, he wouldn't do that to Iraq or Iraq would be mad or...  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then I realized it's not.  No, this is just the shit that happens, man.  Yeah.  I was just looking down the hall.  Mars walking around.  Oh, there's Troy.  Oh, here comes Troy Kwan.  Really, just for another minute.  But I want to know if he has any insight into this or into their relationship. 
[00:53:30]  Yeah.  I'm fascinated by this.  Troy.  You can jump on here.  Try any additional information.  Have you been listening?  Yes.  Now, should Iraq be mad at Roland for what Roland did to him outside?  Pockets, pockets, pockets, pockets, pockets, pockets, pockets.  By the way, Blaze, for me, on PalTalk, has officially thrown out the first faggot.  They really don't like...  What club does he work at?  Yeah, I think he has the right to be mad at Roland, but he won't be for too long. 
[00:54:00]  Why is that?  Why won't he be?  I think Sam explained it pretty good.  I mean, Roland is his hookup, so he's not going to fuck him.  So it's not based on friendship.  It's based on fucking...  He can do things for me.  I mean, yeah.  Oh.  Wow.  Do you feel like Iraq should be more mad?  I think Iraq has the right to be mad at everybody.  Really?  I mean, he's taking his beatings from everybody in this room.  So I understand why.  But, you know, at the same time, I mean, I think everybody sort of gets frustrated with 
[00:54:30]  some of the way some of the things are done, so...  All poor Iraq did yesterday was call out sick.  He just wanted...  Yes, that's all he did.  ...to sleep in and wake up and probably eat something not good for him and go to see Conan.  In the end, it was great radio.  Of course it was.  It was amazing radio.  But I'm just saying, that's why...  But you are right.  He didn't do anything wrong.  Yesterday...  Right.  He actually was actually beneficial to the show.  He wasn't here.  Poor kid just wanted to sleep in a little bit.  He's still tired. 
[00:55:00]  Just thinking like, ah, he could sleep.  Rub some Vicks on his chest.  This is great.  Day off.  Yeah.  Go to Conan later.  Yeah.  Treat himself to a photo, maybe.  And none of it worked out for him.  Not only did none of it work out, but he's insulted by everybody he's close to.  Two lies are exposed that...  Not like the shit was rolling downhill and it got passed to him.  Right, right.  For no reason, Roland burst in.  Is this on?  He's going to Conan.  And fucking...  And then doesn't take him.  And then doesn't take him.  And then somebody else... 
[00:55:30]  Who mentioned that E-Rock was doing the whole not voiceover thing?  I don't even remember how that came up.  I didn't do shit.  Oh, right.  Yeah, the weekend show thing.  Oh, yeah.  I don't remember how that even came up.  I didn't want to fucking have to repent.  I didn't do shit.  You don't remember how it came up because Obi brought it up out of nowhere.  Oh.  Troy, can I ask you a question?  What are you talking about out of nowhere?  Out of nowhere.  Troy, you seem to...  You seem to get...  Like pockets?  You rock.  Holy shit.  You love pockets.  How many pockets?  Keys, money, buttons, hats. 
[00:56:00]  How many pockets?  40 pockets on that thing.  There's pockets there, too?  I don't even see those.  What do you put in there?  A fucking monocle?  All right.  You could...  Sorry.  All right.  You give Iraq a lot of criticism, I see, and stuff.  What is the one thing that Iraq does that really you look at during work that you look  at and go, oh, boy.  I don't know if I feel like going down this road.  I just want to know because I hear things, but I don't hear anything specific.  It gets exhausting.  Yeah, it really does. 
[00:56:30]  It's just...  It's something that will never change, and you just have to accept it.  What is it?  Uh, there...  He's very lazy with a lot of things.  Oh.  Iraq, are you lazy?  But it seems like he works really hard.  I mean, yeah.  He knows how to rig it, so he, uh...  Oof.  I'm not...  I mean, this is all stuff I've told him to his face off the show, so it's not...  I'm not talking shit.  Iraq, how do you respond to the fact that he is calling you out for being lazy and faking work?  For the record, I don't get that impression. 
[00:57:00]  No.  I don't pay enough attention.  Why?  I'm being honest.  I know, but it's just...  I'm getting the impression that Iraq's here now, and he's mad at you, so now you're Team  Iraq all of a sudden.  No, no, not right.  Whereas yesterday, he wasn't here, and you completely exposed his lies for no reason.  I couldn't live with the lies.  Well, I don't want you to have to do that.  All right.  No one should have to live with the lies.  You're right.  Iraq, comment?  No, no comment.  Oh, shit.  You sound so down in there.  I know.  Why are you so downtrodden?  What the fuck do you think? 
[00:57:30]  But, I mean, you got two days now.  Day two of this bullshit.  Well, then stick up for yourself if someone's saying that you're lazy.  I did this already, Jim.  Oh, okay.  I'm not reiterating this same bullshit.  It's all been dealt with.  I'm not going over it again.  Can you make a top five list?  Who you hate the most?  Oh, that's a good idea.  Yeah.  But start with five.  Who is like...  From five.  Five.  And one is the worst.  Yeah.  And remember, I've never exposed any of your lies. 
[00:58:00]  No fucking pontificating.  I'm just saying.  Who are you mad at the most?  So, we're going to do this again.  You don't like me lobbying?  Like we did three times this year.  You don't like me lobbying?  That you're lobbying.  Why would I be number one?  I didn't fucking leave you outside, Conan.  That's going to piss me off.  I should be two, maybe three.  No lobbying.  It was a nice day.  Fuck that.  I don't leave him outside.  You just have to let him give his top five list of shitheads.  Why am I number one always?  He didn't listen.  He let you fucking...  Oh, shit. 
[00:58:30]  You didn't listen to what I said.  I said, so we're going to do this again for the third time this year.  We're doing a top five where Opie's going to be number one.  We've done this bit a couple times.  Why do I have to be number one?  I didn't say you were now.  These were the previous two times.  Didn't it make it sound like I'm going to be number one again?  It did sound that way.  Are you more mad?  I do want to hear the list.  Yeah, now I want to hear the list.  Are you more mad at being left outside of Conan or at having your weekend thing talked about? 
[00:59:00]  What's more annoying to you?  Well, let him do the list.  Or is the celebrity pictures thing bothering you?  No, that doesn't bother me.  Okay.  Give us the five people.  Starting at five.  Number five.  There wasn't five people involved.  But just in general.  But in general.  In order of cock girth.  Five people you...  Wait, there's one, two, three, four...  There's six people in studio, so...  Top six.  Who's number five?  On the list of I'm fucking furious.  I don't like this person.  Yeah.  Today.  Today.  Mm-hmm. 
[00:59:30]  Who's number five?  Probably...  Twitter.  Jimmy.  There's only four people here that were involved with all of this.  Not even all this.  Just overall.  How are you saying there's only four people?  Because Jim and Ant didn't start any of this.  They piled on.  They didn't start any of this.  We piled on.  They piled on.  We made fun of them, but we didn't...  They made it hurt more.  Expose any of it.  We didn't know any of it.  Are we tied for five?  Yeah.  So you two are tied for five.  Jesus Christ.  We're tied for five.  Okay. 
[01:00:00]  So four, then, would be...  Sam.  How are you...  Sam comes in at number four.  Being an asshole.  Now, who comes in at number three?  Our three lucky finalists.  I better be three.  Three is Troy.  Jesus.  Troy comes in at number three.  Wow.  Three.  Nice.  Nice.  Is it because Troy is normally dragged in, and the information is asked of him, he doesn't  just come in?  Oh, yeah.  That's a good point.  How is he three?  Now, who is the first runner-up? 
[01:00:30]  It's between Roland or Opie.  Before the big crowning.  Number two is Opie.  All right.  Oh.  And then Roland.  What an asshole.  Now, are you just saying that because you're afraid?  I think I should have been three.  No.  Because I said he was number one twice this year, so...  Okay.  Number one twice.  I guess I dethroned you.  Congratulations.  And Roland is dethroned on you.  I was really upset with the thing with Roland yesterday, but I confronted him, and it's dealt  with.  And we still got to talk, I guess. 
[01:01:00]  Nah.  No, now you're just doing that for the radio.  Yeah.  We'll talk.  You're not going to talk.  It's fine.  No, we'll talk.  Mm-hmm.  Wow.  Wow.  Ooh.  Wow.  I should be three.  Just one.  Go on records.  Wow.  I should be three.  You should.  Fucking Troy.  Trash is work ethic.  Think about Iraq.  Think Trash is work ethic.  Yeah, but I think about Sam.  Yeah, but Troy's argument is recycled.  We've had that argument before.  And it's valid.  On the air.  It's valid. 
[01:01:30]  I was losing sleep over the lies.  I'm sorry.  I was feeling the pressure.  I was feeling the pressure.  I was feeling the pressure.  You had to fucking turn states.  Yeah, this new information was so hard for you to deal with.  All right.  All right.  Well, we sure got to the bottom of that.  How are you guys tied for?  Stirring up more shit.  You tied for fifth?  Fifth.  Come on.  We didn't bring any of it up.  That's the right thing in this case.  We didn't bring any.  I didn't know any of it.  I don't know the inner workings.  I have no idea that's just happening. 
[01:02:00]  There's no safety in my lack of knowledge as to what anyone does around this place.  If you said that Roland had been voicing all that stuff, I would have believed you.  But you guys couldn't wait to pick up baseball bats at that point.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, I'll take a swing.  Sure.  But, you know, it's nothing personal.  It's just fun.  Everybody else is kicking the fucking poor kid in the face.  Why wouldn't I?  It's fun.  It's fun.  It's nothing personal.  No, nothing at all.  I have no agenda to it.  I just, you're seeing someone get hit.  You've got to get your shots.  Yeah, if they found gay porn on Troy's computer, I'd jump on him, too, and they fucked.  You know what I mean?  Of course, again.  File trade. 
[01:02:30]  Pockets, really.  I just need to know.  Troy's wearing a jacket with a lot of pockets.  I might have OCD.  That's five at least.  But I'm thinking pockets within pockets.  Seven pockets.  I don't know if there's any inside here.  Damn.  No.  You need all that pockets for him.  Seven fucking pockets.  Probably condoms.  Big cock.  Keeps judges in them like so many nickels and dimes.  All right, I guess everyone's good now.  Horrible.  Sam, we're good, right?  No.  Right.  Everyone's good.  We're all back on the same team. 
[01:03:00]  I'm thinking.  No.  Why?  It's still a lot of resentment.  That's hatred.  Yeah, this is anger.  And your lack of acceptance for the responsibility of what you did.  I just want to make sure I wasn't number one again.  I mean, as long as you're number two, you're fine.  No, I want to argue that I should be three, but if I have to accept two, I'll accept two.  How should you be three?  You start the whole thing.  I didn't start the whole thing.  There's tape.  You started it at 613.  Not you, Sam.  Yeah, Sam.  No, you started it at 613. 
[01:03:30]  How did I start?  Because you said, E-Rock is taking a sick day to start the show.  Get him on the phone.  Yeah.  He got you there.  All right.  And then, if you listen to the replay, E-Rock?  If you listen to the tape, at 9...  How do you know?  I know.  At 920 or so, you're saying...  What E-Rock doesn't understand, I fucking love this version of E-Rock.  I fucking love it.  At 920, you're saying, I don't like anything that's in front of me.  I specifically said, you know, we've got an update on one of the Jocktober stations. 
[01:04:00]  You specifically didn't go with that and announced to the world what E-Rock's lie was for no reason.  I don't know about that.  Except for the fact that you couldn't live with the lie.  That was the reason.  Well, fair enough.  But I heard you say...  I'm a church-going man.  You were losing sleep over the lie.  Yeah.  Did you sleep soundly last night?  Not really.  That was because my kid was restless.  Didn't have anything to do with the fact that you completely made E-Rock's life horrible around here?  No, I explained to E-Rock through a text why I didn't get back to him. 
[01:04:30]  And then I turned off my phone.  So I didn't get your response if you did write me back.  Wow.  Yeah.  I wrote...  I wrote, got real busy with my son and my wife was gone all day for school.  Is that okay with you?  Oh, and then you turned your phone off?  Yes.  Can you imagine if this was the way you were treated by a man you once listed as one of  your heroes on MySpace?  What are you going to do?  Can you imagine?  MySpace is dead.  Hero.  Apparently so are heroes.  Remember the hero list?  Yeah.  MySpace means nothing. 
[01:05:00]  If I'm on a hero list on a Facebook page, that's a different story.  You're not going to make that list on E-Rock's Facebook page.  I don't think anyone's making a hero list.  But I think we're all on the same page, which is good.  Except Hulk Hogan.  As we head into the second hour of the show, right?  Yes.  Everyone's good?  Yeah.  Troy, you good?  I'm hungry.  I know that much.  I'm not hungry.  I'm not hungry.  You got a cupcake belly?  Two.  I'm looking at, what the fuck are these?  Eggs, I know.  Yeah, who wants them?  Stupid fucking eggs.  Two fucking amazing cupcakes.  That chocolate chip one, dude, I literally can still taste it. 
[01:05:30]  Does anyone miss Troy's smile?  What?  Remember when Troy first started with us?  Oh, yeah.  Do you remember that?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I miss the Troy smile.  You know who misses Troy's smile?  Management.  Because they know we turned another one?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's just the vibe of the show.  You know what I mean?  You have to just be fucking evil.  Look at his eyes.  You know what I mean?  You'll have to be ready to fucking attack and kill when you come in this room.  He came in like that replacement in Nam. 
[01:06:00]  Exactly.  All smiles showing pictures of his girl to everybody.  Here's my best girl.  We're going to get married when I get home.  Hey, Garner.  Yeah.  Troy looked at me like square in the face once, and he said, you know, Sam, it's like  when you come in here, you have to be ready to go to fucking war.  When I get on that elevator downstairs, I'm in battle mode.  I'm ready to fucking go.  That's what the people expect out there.  Do you always wonder when you're getting called in, like, what's going to happen?  Like, all right, this is going to...  Well, that's the vibe of the show, right?  You have to come in here ready to fucking slit throats. 
[01:06:30]  It's the best you can.  Am I wrong in saying that?  Do you know what I mean?  Like, that's the vibe of the show.  I love hearing the new perspective from the new guy.  Listen, I'm telling you, there is no other show that I would rather work for.  I enjoy working for you guys.  The show outside of here is fucking hysterical.  What's going on in the back with Roland and Sam?  It really is.  It's a cool vibe.  But the vibe of this studio, when the mics are cracked, is you have to fucking kill. 
[01:07:00]  Darkness.  Oh, there's a lot of, you know, there's a lot of boring shows around here.  You could work for one of these shows where you're allowed to bring a pet in.  I'm not complaining.  Oh, there's another bash.  You're talking about the morning mash-up again.  I just don't understand how you have enough time to bring your dog in to work.  She doesn't like when you bring up the dog.  Sounds innocent enough.  Then stop bringing the dog in.  It's so cute, though.  I like to pet her.  I'm a little bit of the dog.  It sounds innocent enough, I mean.  I like to give her a little chin, sugar.  Sure, it's hypoallergenic.  We don't even have time to eat.  She has time to take care of a dog.  She plays the hits. 
[01:07:30]  Yeah, the hits are being played.  They talk less than we do.  A lot less.  Yeah.  Should I have time to pet a dog?  Sure.  Stanley T.  I just know in his heart hates it, but he'll never say it.  Wow.  I don't know.  Stan's a killer.  Like, Stan's a legitimate fucking tough guy, even though he's really nice around here  and we all like him.  Stan's a fucking problem.  Oh, yeah.  So he probably likes the little dogs.  Guys like that always like little dogs.  Yeah.  Just big fucking galoots.  Yeah.  Big guys.  Guys, headbreakers will always pick up a little dog and go, like, aw. 
[01:08:00]  You know?  They're adorable.  Yeah.  Break time.  Yeah.  So we're all good, I'm assuming.  Just in time for the weekend.  Everything's good.  Couldn't be worse.  Huh?  No.  I was just saying we should go to break.  Things couldn't be worse.  But what would you?  Things couldn't be worse.  Why?  It's exactly where we should be.  The ascension in the ranks.  No, no, no.  It's actually as bad, if not worse, than when we started.  No.  I think we cleared some things up.  Everyone got the point of view out.  Point out what was going on as opposed to solving anything. 
[01:08:30]  And everything's good now, right?  Perfect.  I think so.  It's because you're gone at 10 o'clock.  I'm eating.  This is great.  And then we leave you guys to just eat each other.  Yeah.  And you come in the next day.  So what do we got, guys?  What do we got for the show?  What's going on?  All happy.  Yeah.  He's been battling for 12 straight hours after we leave.  All right.  We're eating.  We're eating.  Chris Hardwick's coming in today, huh?  He'll be here at 9.  But you know what else happens at 9?  It's funny you mention 9 o'clock.  Oh.  Tickets for the Borgata are on sale. 
[01:09:00]  We have sold, I think, six times more in pre-sale than we did last year.  This show will sell it.  Well, tickets?  Actually, six.  No, six.  Six times more tickets than were sold last year in the pre-sale.  So this is absolutely going to sell out quickly.  January, whatever it is, 14th, me, Artie, Doug, Dave.  I don't know.  To be honest, I don't know if they're going to do a second one or not because it's up to  Artie and Doug who want to do a second show.  I don't know.  So don't assume they're going to add a second show. 
[01:09:30]  Yeah.  That's the only reason why I brought it up.  Artie's schedule is fucked up because he's doing the radio on Friday night, so he can't  do Friday night gigs.  Whatever.  It's Borgata.com, 9 o'clock.  It will sell out.  Okay.  Good.  I would love another show.  Because that's more money for me, but I don't know if they can do it.  Eric, you got something to play to break?  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  Yeah.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  I'll say my name.  Come on.  The D, the I, the D, the D, the Y, the D, the I, the D is D-D-E. 
[01:10:00]  The whole lot is D-D-E.  That's crazy.  The D, the I, the D, the D, the Y, the D, the I, the D is D-D-E.  The whole lot is D-D-E.  The Y, the D, the D, the D, the D, the D, the D, the D, the D, the D, the D, the D-E.  Well, this has to.  What?  A theme.  It's a rejoiner thematic thing.  Are we getting topical?  No, we're not, because someone didn't give me the desk. 
[01:10:30]  Ah.  Wait, can you wait five seconds?  Why don't we just leave a while?  Oh, geez.  Get topical?  The sex man.  The sex man.  All right.  Yeah.  I don't even know what this one's about.  I'm looking around.  Do you see it?  A little fax.  Was slavery abolished this day in 1965? 
[01:11:00]  Is it 65?  Is it straight out of confidence?  1865?  That bad?  NWA?  Oh, Diddy's birthday.  Oh, it's Diddy.  Oh, it's Diddy's birthday.  It's his birthday today?  How old am I to Diddy?  42.  42.  Damn.  Loretta Swit from MASH.  Hot lips.  Houlihan is 74.  Yikes.  Laura Bush, 65.  I thought she was older.  Oh, boy.  I was about to say something that almost got us fired when Homeless Charlie said it.  Oh, yeah.  But, I mean, I would, you know, I would, you know, she's still a looker. 
[01:11:30]  Let's just put it that way.  That Laura Bush is a looker.  Yeah.  Ralph Macchio, the karate kid, is 50 today?  Yeah.  Oh, that's the rock we know.  That's right.  Is he 50 fucking years old then?  50.  He's 50.  Happened.  Yeah.  Where'd all that time go?  Jesus Christ.  Yeah.  Ronald Reagan elected president 31 years ago.  Yes. 
[01:12:00]  That's all I do now.  That's my only impression of Reagan.  That's all you need to do.  It's more than he does.  Oh, boy.  Looks like Ralph Macchio needs to go to, uh...  What happened?  Yeah.  Ralph Macchio could use some follicles.  What was that pick you just showed?  Let me see that one.  What?  What happened?  Has he got a little bit of a...  No, the one that had side-by-side.  It flashes to the website.  There.  It flashes for five seconds.  All right.  So his forehead is receding a bit.  Wow.  Bald celebrity. 
[01:12:30]  Oh, it's such a heart-fucking-heartless sight.  Look at that.  He's all right.  He's a little bit.  He looks like Elon Musk.  He's got a little bit of gold.  Jesus Christ.  But he's got plenty of harvest area for follicles.  You can see.  Yeah, but when you have to start adding it in front like that, I think that's when you get problems,  no?  Nah.  They're amazing.  They place it to individual follicles in the direction your hair normally naturally grows  for a natural hairline.  Well, who else is bald, by the way?  On bald celebrities?  That's a harsh sight, man.  That is a harsh-ass sight. 
[01:13:00]  Unless, you know, you're Jason Alexander.  You don't want to hear it.  Let's see.  Who's that?  Twilight guy?  Keelan Lutz?  Keep going until we see somebody we know.  I don't know.  Who's that?  Same guy.  Oh, okay.  He's not dead.  Howard Cosell, really?  Jesus Christ.  Enough with this sight.  That's kind of a drop-off.  Enough with this sight.  Stop already.  Mick Mars?  Was it Alice Cooper?  Hey, we lost a guar guy.  The guitarist, right? 
[01:13:30]  I did not know anything about him, to be honest with you.  But what?  They found him dead on the tour bus going into Canada?  Really?  You didn't hear about the drugs?  I don't know.  I knew that he was dead, but I didn't know how.  You're kidding.  They found him on the tour bus as they were taking it to Canada.  And it's not the guy we had on.  No, not Odorous.  No, we had Odorous, yeah.  Yeah, we had Odorous on.  So, a lot of people are very upset about that today.  No answers as to...  I don't know much about guar.  Why?  I just know that Beavis and Butthead fucking loved guar. 
[01:14:00]  Yeah.  Did they?  And we loved having Odorous on the show, and he'll be on again, I'm sure.  Fucking knew Beavis and Butthead last night was hilarious.  Was it good?  Holy shit.  I was disappointed by the first one.  Really?  Yeah, I want them to show more clips.  Oh, yeah.  I don't like when they have that animated story running through the whole thing.  Yeah, they always do that.  They always have done that over the years.  I know, but a little less of that, I'm thinking.  No?  Yeah, I'm thinking, you know, I would rather see a whole clip show.  But they nailed that.  It's fucking funny as shit. 
[01:14:30]  They nailed that MGMT video.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  With the kid fucking losing his mind, crying and screaming.  Yeah.  And you have to think, like they said, that someone's mom had to put their kid in such  a horrific position.  Yeah.  For fame purposes.  You like it, though, huh?  Last night was good?  Yeah, it's just fun to see.  I don't see it yet.  Here, oh, video been removed.  Ah, look at that.  Copyright infringement.  Oh, boy.  It's just somebody.  Is that how we listen to TV, by the way? 
[01:15:00]  If the camera picks it up that way?  I always wondered that.  It doesn't sound that way to me.  Why is it when you're watching TV, it sounds perfectly clear, but then you try to tape something  off the TV, it sounds like this.  Is that how our ears are hearing it?  I think it's all echoey, and it's the room, I think.  But I don't get it.  I always wondered why you can't look at an arc welder, or you'll get arc burn in your 
[01:15:30]  eyes, but if you film an arc welder, and then look at the film, it won't burn your eyes.  That's because TV's, and you should know this, they all have prison filters.  Shut up.  It's not actually throwing off the light, it's just producing.  We're talking about something probably everyone saw, but they're...  The Butthead looked the fucking same, though.  They look good.  Yeah, they look great.  They haven't aged at all.  It's nice, you know?  It's a good thing.  It's funny.  They were doing a customer service, tech service, last night on the show. 
[01:16:00]  It was fucking hilarious.  Was it...  Yeah.  Did they show more clips?  Um, they showed clips from, uh, 16 and Pregnant, and, uh, this other one where some woman  is a psychic, and that was pretty funny, because she's fat, and she's with some fat guy at this  restaurant called Toots.  They're at Toots.  And then they're sitting there talking, it's a dumb reality show.  Mm-hmm.  And, uh, it, uh, it just turned into, um, them goofing on how fat they were. 
[01:16:30]  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  How many years is it off the air?  Probably close to 10, I would assume.  Yeah.  Right?  I thought it would have felt longer.  Oh.  I don't remember when it went off.  I thought 10 was a lot.  When did it start?  How many questions am I going to ask?  I don't know anything.  I used to love this show.  We were in, uh, Boston radio when they were fucking huge, because all our listeners used  to call with their little Beavis and Butthead voices.  Oh, yeah.  But they weren't even trying to put on a voice.  They were like, uh, we want to hear, like, some corn. 
[01:17:00]  Right.  Like, it was a high-pitched version, because they were just kids that would talk like that.  It was on from 93 to 97.  Wow.  So it's been off 14 years.  Holy shit.  Wow.  Hopped right back on.  Wow.  Yeah.  Um, what were we going to do?  Oh, we were talking about, uh, previous to that.  I want to make it perfectly clear that Sam is starting this one.  What the fuck are you talking about?  Is it more shit starring?  Yeah, look what he put up on the screen.  You asked me to put this up. 
[01:17:30]  I didn't even know this went out to anybody.  Can we get a copy of that printed?  Uh, yes.  Because I want to see it.  I can't read it.  I guess we made...  What is this, like a newsletter?  I guess we made Scott Greenstein's self-serving email.  Is it a year-end thing?  Huh?  End of year thing, is it?  Well, not yet.  I don't know.  Well, you always start your end-of-year things now, I think.  I guess SiriusXM had a pretty good quarter or something.  Oh, good.  Oh.  I mean, just pretty good.  You're welcome.  You don't want to give him too much credit? 
[01:18:00]  No.  Well, you almost complimented him.  Credit schmettit.  And I say them as if it's not us.  I gotta shut up.  By pretty good, you know.  Mm-hmm.  They were hoping for more.  But it wasn't as bad as it could have been.  You need to know, you asshole.  By pretty good.  I mean, it was just...  Well...  It's just...  The gang on Wall Street was hoping for a little more.  Yeah.  But...  Where are they?  They did pretty good.  Will you shut up? 
[01:18:30]  What do you mean to me?  I'm just laughing at what you're saying.  Who wants to read this long self-serving?  That's why I'm trying to email.  Do you print it?  I just had to...  How long is this thing?  Not long.  I mean...  Scroll.  Let me see.  Scroll down.  I'll read it when it comes.  And where are we?  Holy shit.  Where are we in this?  Your highlight.  Oh, there we are.  We're in the...  The little orange dot.  Hold on.  How many paragraphs down are we?  One, two, three, four...  You're in the fourth out of...  No, we're barely in the fourth.  The fourth paragraph is the biggest paragraph, and we're at the end of the biggest paragraph  in the six-paragraph self-serving email from the big boss. 
[01:19:00]  Let me see it, Sam.  It's a little too much to read from this far away.  Go to the top, Sam.  I can't read from the middle.  Wait.  You guys want to play a game?  It's called What He Thinks is More Important Than Us.  Because it's all the stuff that comes before us.  Yeah.  Don't you...  Would you agree, Ed?  Sure.  Okay.  Who wants to read this?  I'll read it.  Okay.  As the president and chief content officer of SiriusXM, I want to take a moment to thank 
[01:19:30]  you for your continued loyalty.  Our subscribers are the most important part of SiriusXM, and as always, we'll continue to  provide you with the quality and diverse content that makes SiriusXM a leader in premium audio  entertainment.  So as we come to the end of the year, I want to look back at the memorable moments we've shared.  All right.  So now it's going to list a lot of memorable moments.  And so far, that's the way you should open it.  And Anthony, of course, was right.  Year end.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Kind of a...  First paragraph's a bit wordy.  Yeah.  But it's an acceptable... 
[01:20:00]  It really is.  It's an acceptable way to open up, you know?  Yeah.  I can't give him an inch.  Nothing.  That guy?  Never.  Well, he's saying the customer's the most important.  He knows it.  I told him to his face.  You have to say customers are most important.  Yeah.  Let's be honest.  I'll say that, too.  I don't believe it.  I'm the most important.  I just say it.  Yeah.  But I say it.  In 2011, we brought you closer than ever to your favorite programming.  Since Paul McCartney's first time ever concert at the Apollo Theater last December, listeners  have been invited to a country party in New York at SiriusXM's concert with Tim McGraw,  a raucous all-access Q&A with the blue-collar comedians in Nashville, intimate in-studio conversations 
[01:20:30]  with Tom Petty, Rascal Flatts, Coldplay, Nirvana, a unique one-night-only experience at the original  Studio 54.  Me and Jim went to that.  Yes, we did.  We held hands the whole time.  That's right.  And he neglected, by the way, to put in a tremendous gasser by Jim, which was kind  of an on-air talent gasser, and numerous other special events.  When we didn't send you to them, we brought the events to you, including over 30 shows 
[01:21:00]  from Margaritaville legend Jimmy Buffett, concert broadcasts from breakout music acts like Mumford  and Sons.  Mumford!  Jesus.  And Lady Antebellum, and live feeds from the Mega Dance Festivals, Electric Daisy, and Electric  Zoo.  So there, it's all about the special events.  So far, no on-air talent stuff.  And all that stuff should be up front.  Yeah, absolutely.  So far, it's, hi, thank you for being here.  And then the second paragraph is, here's some of the weird things we've done, or the fun  things we've done.  Here's paragraph three.  Listeners were on the air themselves more this year with the launch of the phone show. 
[01:21:30]  The phone show?  A no-holds-barred call-in-and-win money grab.  Steve Sterniello's phone show is the first fucking actual show he mentions.  They love the phone show here.  Why?  Well, that was just one of the new shows introduced in 2011.  A year that saw the addition of the legendary radio personality, Dr. Laura, and the number  one name in gossip, TMZ Live. 
[01:22:00]  Although throughout the year, SiriusXM created many unique limited engagement satellite channels,  including Mandatory Metallica, Simon & Garfunkel Radio, Tim McGraw Radio, Cinco de Mayo, Comedia  with George Lopez, Book of Mormon Radio, Comic-Con Radio, Real Housewives Radio, and John Edwards  Psychic Radio.  And in August, we unveiled the newest, exclusive 24-7 channel to join our lineup with the debut  of Studio 54 Radio.  And can I just say I'm very proud to have been a part of Comic-Con Radio?  That officially means that I was listed before. 
[01:22:30]  You are.  Don't say your name.  And by the way, if the listeners could see Sam's Woody Allen hand gestures, you'd want  to fucking lop them off.  But I will say, that's all just, this is what happened this year.  This is a year-end summary.  So he's listing the shows that have started this year.  So far, it's not like other shows are being mentioned ahead of the show.  I mean, as of yet.  I think the all-important paragraph four is when that starts happening.  Well, let's see.  All right, let's see if there's any surprises.  In addition to the new program we brought you in 2011, we are excited to continue to be 
[01:23:00]  able to bring you the Howard Stern Show and to extend and expand our relationships with  the NFL by adding play-by-play coverage to our online and smartphone lineup.  With the addition of even more sports play-by-play, Sirius XM remains the undisputed audio leader  in sports, the only place to hear the NFL, including 14 feeds of the game.  I'm sorry, including 14 feeds of the Super Bowl, MLB, NASCAR, NBA, NHL, and college sports, 
[01:23:30]  including multiple bowl games, and every game of the NCAA men's basketball tournament,  and many other major sporting events, such as the Kentucky Derby, every PGA and major golf  tournament, and the Indianapolis 500.  We also added to our sports talk lineup with new shows on College Sports Nation, Fantasy  Sports Radio, and Mad Dog Radio, and continue to provide our one-of-a-kind weekly call-ins  from the college football coaches and every coach in the NFL. 
[01:24:00]  There's not enough about sports.  There's a lot of sports.  Holy shit.  Also, whether it was Lady Gaga on Oprah Radio, the Anthony Wiener controversy spilling on  to the Opie and Anthony, spilling on to Opie and Anthony, or Jamie Foxx live from the Super  Bowl, listeners continue to enjoy the best-of-the-moment entertainment available on radio.  Hey, yeah.  Now, we're in there.  There's a couple of ways to look at that.  That's really not that bad. 
[01:24:30]  It's not bad because, all right, Howard gets mentioned first.  The rest is literally all sports, and as far as the show is, we're one of three events  mentioned.  Right.  One was Lady Gaga, one is Jamie Foxx at the Super Bowl, and one is us.  I can't really rip my belt this one.  I could rip him on looking like he let a five-year-old sign his name.  What kind of signature is that?  Number five.  Our commitment to bring you new and exciting... 
[01:25:00]  Oh, right here.  We like to...  And the biggest surprise of the year was Jim Norton's Boneyard show, which we think if  Jim could improv, he'd say something funny here, but he can't.  It sounds like it's written.  So he just said that.  So here we go.  I'll just read what he actually wrote.  Our commitment to bring you new and exciting programming is continuing with the introduction  of over 20 new channels that explore and explode genres with new formats like Rock Bar and SiriusXM  Comes Alive, and exclusive channels including Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Radio, ESPN Sports 
[01:25:30]  Center, Carlin's Corner, and UCB Radio.  We also introduced a new suite of Spanish language channels with music genres raging from regional  Mexican oldies and tropical to pop, rock and urban plus exclusive news and talk channels  like Radio Formula Mexico and Playboy Radio en Español.  These new channels are available online on smartphones and the new SiriusXM Edge Radio and are just  the first phase in the next evolution of satellite radio. 
[01:26:00]  And don't forget, Artie Lang, Jim Norton, Doug Stanhope, and David Tell, January 14th,  Borgata tickets on sale 9 a.m. this morning.  Scott, you didn't have to.  We look forward to bringing you in even more content and features next year.  Thank you again for being a subscriber.

[01:26:30]  Sincerely, Scott Greenstein.  Holy shit.  It's the longest fucking memo thing ever.  No one's reading all that.  It's not bad, though.  No one's reading all that.  It's long, though.  It's way too long.  It really is.  Cut to the trace.  Right.  By the way, I put in my own plug.  No, you didn't.  It wasn't in there?  I thought it was written.  You naturally segged into it.  Yep.  Hey, I want to hear the Kimmel thing.  Oh, okay.  That's fucking...  That sounds hilarious. 
[01:27:00]  What a great idea.  I didn't say it.  Yeah, Kimmel's show, man, those writers, him, whoever the fuck it is, they come up with  really funny fucking ideas.  Thank you.  And this one sounds hilarious.  Yes.  Yes.  It's apparently Jimmy Kimmel.  He...  Well, I think he actually explains it in the video.  Why am I going to...  Yeah.  You want me to play it from here?  You should just play it from there.  Yeah, I want to see the video.  I see it, Sam.  I can't see.  You play it, Sam.  You play it.  Thank you.  Yeah.  This is what Jimmy Kimmel did.  I issued a challenge to the parents of America. 
[01:27:30]  I asked parents to pretend they ate all their kids' Halloween candy.  And videotape that.  Oh, boy.  It's loading now because...  Oh, God.  Because our network sucks dick.  And videotape that and post it to YouTube under the heading,  Hey, Jimmy Kimmel, I told my kids I ate all their Halloween candy.  And a lot of people did.  And I guess I didn't expect so much crying.  I kind of thought the kids would be just mad. 
[01:28:00]  Almost every one of them cries.  But we got what they...  We got.  And to those children whose tears are about to be immortalized on television,  I apologize in advance.  I'm going to tell you what happened to your candy, Blake.  Oh, no.  I ate it all.  It just falls down on the ground.  I ate yours, too, Alan.  Me and Mommy ate it last night when you were asleep. 
[01:28:30]  They just collapsed on the floor.  I ate your Halloween candy last night.  Daddy, where's the candy?  What candy?  Daddy!  Can you get all your candy?  Can you get all your candy?  Oh, little fat girl.  Yeah.  Oh, she's mad.  I think I made all your candy. 
[01:29:00]  All right, that kid's too old to cry.  Yeah.  Don't cry, kid.  It's little Anthony.  Please don't cry.  Oh, Jesus.  Aw.  He's too old to cry.  What's that about?  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  I tricked you.  Oh, no.  Dad didn't eat all your candy.  Oh.  I tricked you.  I'm very, very sorry, Rachel.  I ate all your Halloween candy.  How much was it?  Oh, Rachel, I'm sorry. 
[01:29:30]  You know I like candy, Rachel.  Do you still love me?  Uh-uh.  I'm so sorry.  It's just, I'm pregnant, and I get really hungry, and I ate all of it.  There you go, Chad.  You didn't eat all your candy.  Hey, how are you, Jimmy?  Yeah, can you get more candy?  I ate them last night.  I took them to work with me.  Yes. 
[01:30:00]  What?  Oh, yeah.  Whoa.  No.  Last night, we stayed up, and we ate all your candy.  Are you guys okay with that?  No.  Why?  No.  Natalie, calm down, Natalie.  Ah, you're ugly.  I ate all your candy.  You have no more Halloween candy left.  What?  She ate it.  What the heck?  What the heck? 
[01:30:30]  Kid goes, what the heck?  Don't you guys think you ate enough candy last night?  No.  I only have, like, one bite of candy.  Are you serious?  Kid's hilarious.  He's all fucking...  Oh, good for you.  Now you're going to probably get a bellyache.  He's like, fuck you.  Why does she need so much candy?  Mom, there's two.  Two what?  Two bags of candy.  Two plus two is equals five. 
[01:31:00]  Stupid.  You were so close.  That kid rules, man.  Did you see how much I had?  I went to a lot of houses.  Holy shit.  I ate it all.  It tasted so good, especially the peanut butter cups.  You sneaky mom.  That's all fucking hilarious.  That's a great bit, Jimmy Kimmel. 
[01:31:30]  Oh, God damn.  Not that you need to hear it from us.  That is a good bit.  Crying kids.  I know.  You sneaky mom.  You son of a bitch.  Good tape.  Whoa.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I ate all your candy.  Oh, Jesus.  Poor kids.  I'm turning into an old woman.  I feel like, I'm like, aw.  What's wrong with me?  Well, it's adorable.  Yeah, I guess so.  It's, you know, it has all the features.  Yeah, you know, it's like watching a kitten video.  They're all like, aw. 
[01:32:00]  How many dislikes?  Let's find out.  Let's see how many dislikes.  That fat girl was great.  Oh, God.  She was pissed.  Uh, 227 dislikes.  Come on.  Well, 325,000.  Yeah, the reason that the fat girl threw the wrapper, that was the only clip where they  actually did unwrap all the candy.  Like, all the other parents, I'm assuming, eventually told them, I'm just kidding, but  all the candy wrappers.  Yeah, were on the table.  He actually ate all our candy. 
[01:32:30]  All right.  We got a slutty answer on Jeopardy that everyone's making a big deal about today.  Oh, yeah.  That's right.  Oh, yeah.  Want to hear this shit?  Sure.  If Andy yearns for Brenda, and Brenda cares about Charlene, who pines for Andy, the three  of them form one of these.  Kara.  What is a threesome?  No.  Roger.  What is a love triangle?  Yes, that's it.  Kara has obviously had much more experience than I. 
[01:33:00]  Roger, back to you.  A love triangle?  Is that what it was?  I thought it was menage a trois.  I thought it was menage a trois, yeah.  Uh, centipede.  Human centipede.  Had awfulness.  And he'd go, what's that?  And then he'd have to go, that's when one mouth is shit into, and then that person sits  to the other mouth.  You know how it is, Alex.  And he'd go, oh, and he'd laugh.  Yes.  Ah, we did that in Montreux.  Is he from Montreal?  I don't know.  He's Canadian, so he says words funny sometimes.  He's got to have the correct pronunciation whenever he says things like that. 
[01:33:30]  Montreux.  How long has that show been on?  Since I was a kid, he's been on.  Forever.  For 25 years, or more?  Well, I think it's, I think there was another host before him.  On Jeopardy?  Yeah, wasn't it like Betty White's husband or something?  Oh, fucking Mr. White.  Whatever it is.  Yeah, Mr. White.  Oh, that guy with the glasses?  Yeah.  Uh, what the hell is his name?  Uh.  Started in 1964.  Oh, my God, really?  And then it looks like.  With who?  Alex Trebek.  No, show me that guy. 
[01:34:00]  Because I know exactly who Ant's talking about.  I see him in my mind.  His name was Alan something.  Yeah, yeah.  Something Alan.  Actually, something Alan, I think.  Last name Alan?  There you go.  Oh, those are producers.  It started in 64?  Yeah, and then Art Fleming?  Oh, Art Fleming.  I see, I was wrong.  Yeah.  What years was he the host?  Fleming.  When did Trebek take over?  Art Fleming was 64 to 75.  Then the show was off.  Oh.  And then he was still the host, 78 to 79. 
[01:34:30]  Though they tried one more year with him, huh?  Came back, okay.  Yeah, and then the show was off until 84, which is when Alex Trebek took over.  Ah, 84.  What is?  1987 years ago.  So you're right, about 25.  What could you do, Jimmy?  27 years.  I can just remember my friend.  Alan Ludden?  Was that who you were talking about?  Alan Ludden.  That's the guy.  That's a name from the past.  Alan Ludden.  I just remember my friend's dad watching it, and I hated it.  I can kind of remember that period of my life where I was like.  Oh, you didn't like him?  No, I didn't get it.  Really?  What is sloppy handwriting? 
[01:35:00]  Fuck them.  It's boring, right?  Yeah.  I don't know.  Well, I found Ben Bailey's show is harder.  Ben's is harder.  The cash cab?  What?  I've gotten one out of 300 questions right on that fucking cash cab.  They made that real easy, Jimmy.  Dude, I stink on cash cab.  They made it easy.  His fucking glowing nightclub cab.  I can't get any right.  Because he's got to focus on the traffic.  Dude, I literally get none right.  The hardest one is the Jeopardy! College fucking thing that they do, because they ask them horrifically  hard questions. 
[01:35:30]  I thought it was collage, so I was expecting a bunch of fun pictures.  Oh, Jimmy.  The cash cab ones are fucking easy.  They're not easy.  They're so fucking easy.  Kind of easy.  Is this cash cab?  Yeah.  I think I get through all but one question.  It's a red light challenge.  All right.  I understand that.  But I've watched a bunch of clips, because I like Ben a lot, and I fucking, I don't think  I've gotten one question, or I've maybe gotten one.  Wow.  You're stupid.  I am.  Jimmy goes, I am.  I'm not good at quiz shows.  In high school, I was voted boy most likely to not perform under pressure on a quiz show. 
[01:36:00]  That's a little habit I picked up from watching the quiz shows.  You know what you're good at, Jimmy?  Yes.  They're selling comedy tickets.  Oh.  Yeah.  Yes.  Let's hope the stress factor is sold out this weekend.  I don't need to be humiliated.  Yay.  It's a multiple answer question.  You have to get all parts of the answer correct in order to win the money.  If you do, it's worth an extra $250.  Multiple part.  You can't play along with this.  You don't get a strike.  You don't lose any money.  You just don't get the extra cash.  And you have 30 seconds to answer.  Maybe Gaga on the cab.  I don't know.  I've finished asking.  Are you ready?  Yeah.  Okay, here we go. 
[01:36:30]  George W. Bush was the most searched politician on Yahoo in 2006.  Name five of the remaining seven politicos.  Barack Obama.  Johnny McCain, Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, John Edwards, John Kerry.  You can't play along with these fast red light challenges.  You just need the regular questions.  Kennedy, Hoover, George Washington, Lincoln.  You just got to name shit quickly, right?  Yeah.  Before the light changes.  It's just a question.  That's right.  We don't need to do that.  Nah, of course not.  What are we? 
[01:37:00]  Game show?  What are we?  Game show over here?  I don't know.  Eh.  I really don't do well on game shows.  I can't think quickly at all.  Think on your feet.  I can on stage, but I can't when I'm doing that type of stuff.  Yeah.  You choke up.  Fuck, dude.  I'm so bad.  Tip of your tongue kind of stuff.  Like, ah, fuck.  What was that?  Aunt Allen London?  Password.  Ludden.  That's password.  Allen Ludden.  Ludden.  The password is... 
[01:37:30]  He was the host of Password.  Before they had any fucking electronic signage, it was just cardboard that someone would slide  in, and then they'd ring a bell.  Okay, here's the...  The password is vagina.  And then it's just, you know, trying to figure it out.  Which game shows did you like?  I used to like concentration.  Really?  Because it made a fun picture at the end.  Okay.  Where you had, you know, one and twelve, and it had a match, and then they'd turn over the  other thing. 
[01:38:00]  And I also...  I like Joker's Wild, because they got very fucking freaked out.  Joker!  Joker!  Oh, and a five.  Yeah, and match game was fun, because it was like this...  It was almost like dirty to watch.  Yeah.  Because they would talk about sexy things.  It was double entendres.  On that one.  Yeah.  What about the pyramid?  Yeah.  $10,000 pyramid, and then $25,000, and then $50,000, and then $100,000.  They went up to $100,000?  Yeah.  They went up at a time when $10,000 turned out to be nothing. 
[01:38:30]  And then stupid Dick Clark would be like he was fucking the genius.  Yeah.  He'd get behind.  He goes, don't turn around.  Don't turn around.  What if I said to you, pan, butter, spatula?  Oh, and then the person's like, look, I lost.  Why am I working at this?  Yeah.  And he's like, he's had time to study the whole thing.  Yeah.  Fuck him.  What an asshole.  That's true.  The only one that has the answer in front of him.  Yeah.  And sometimes I never understood, like, why they beeped somebody's clue. 
[01:39:00]  Like, oh, sorry.  You gave that one, and it comes in later.  It goes, you actually used a portion of the answer in your description of...  I didn't even hear that.  This fucking game...  I fucking was on a quiz show once when I was a kid.  In school.  I couldn't think of the capital of Louisiana.  Couldn't.  Baton Rouge.  Yeah.  Red stick.  There's a little bit of electricity in the air tonight because you are partaking of the 
[01:39:30]  very first $100,000 pyramid.  What?  And it used to be the million dollar pyramid, so it was really a letdown.  It is easy.  For you, even.  Who's the celebrity guest?  I love these.  You two are on...  Oh, Vicky Lawrence.  Vicky Lawrence.  You're amongst our best players.  We welcome you back because I don't have to explain the rules to you.  We will introduce our...  Is this 70s or 80s?  This looks like 80s.  This is one of those games you can play along with.  Very early.  Oh, really?  85.  I'm a freelance stage manager. 
[01:40:00]  Oh, you're a dyke.  Wow.  No, in theater.  Look at that fucking hairdo.  That is...  Leather Tuscan arrow.  Amazing.  Amazingly dyke-ish.  I hope you get over that winner's circle when it's...  There's all pyramids behind them.  We get it.  No.  I'm doing just terrific.  Who is that?  Have you ever partnered with Vicky Lawrence before me?  Never.  I was just watching her play.  No one cares.  Who are you?  Adrian Smed?  Who is that?  Well, you know we have a little thing going here.  She has a tendency to leap on my head on occasion.  These 1970s graphics are great.  They're just terrible.  Yeah, it's terrible. 
[01:40:30]  The audio sucks.  I know.  What about No Whammy's hand?  I was a big No Whammy guy.  I hated that one.  The only time I liked it was when that guy figured out the pattern and fucking got so  much money from them.  What do you mean?  No Whammy, No Whammy.  I hated that.  Yeah, I hated the show.  It's terrible.  A guy figured out the...  And he knew the pattern and knew exactly when it hit.  And he won, like, how much money did that motherfucker win?  Why would he ever say he knew the pattern?  Maybe he told it after?  No, they watched.  In horror, they watched as he was still on. 
[01:41:00]  There's a whole documentary on this.  But as they were watching, they realized, oh, fuck, this guy figured something out.  And they couldn't do anything about it because he wasn't cheating.  So, like, did he...  Michael Larson.  Did he know...  Spins of Terror, they call it?  Yeah.  Wait, we gotta play this.  And there was no limit, so he just kept fucking winning.  And how did they get him off the show, then?  I don't remember.  And was he, like, kind of one of those card counters?  He just had a knack of figuring out the pattern and when a certain light would light up and 
[01:41:30]  then when to hit it and it would always go to a prize and never a whammy.  So you mean, like, say he would watch for the triangle or whatever?  Right.  So that triangle lit up.  Right.  Light up.  And then he'd hit it.  Or whatever.  Do you think he watched a bunch of these?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, no shit.  This guy made a fortune and...  Yeah, start this over.  Stop!  You ready to do it from the beginning?  Oh, he's clapping his ass off.  Because he knows he...  Oh!  Stop! 
[01:42:00]  I need lots of money.  Fit number two.  Come on.  Go!  Stop!  Oh, hold on, hold on.  Pause a minute.  Pause this.  The boss is talking.  I remember something else also, because I watched this documentary.  It's great.  How do you get this?  On Netflix?  Yeah, it's on...  It's on...  The whole documentary is on YouTube.  Oh, I gotta check this out today.  One thing that was really cool that he brought up, he said, they wanted you to be very energetic  and, no whammies, come on, come on, come on!  And he goes, if you notice, I wasn't really saying a lot, because he was concentrating so 
[01:42:30]  hard.  He had a focus.  He had a focus, so he was just like, come on, no whammy.  Like, he's constantly, you could tell he's scanning the board.  So they want you to say, no whammies, no whammies, and clap, just because this way you're  not seeing a...  Maybe.  Wow.  I think they just want you to be enthusiastic.  Okay.  They want to make good TV.  Yeah, they want to make good TV.  Oh, they're all enthusiastic.  This guy fucked them for so much money.  100,000.  Was it?  100 grand?  And you made nothing on this.  It was probably more than that.  Let me go to Corey and Yonkers.  100,000 in the 80s. 
[01:43:00]  I mean, it's still a lot of money today.  Yeah.  In the 80s.  Holy shit.  Corey, what do you got, buddy?  Quick.  Hey, guys.  Yeah, I saw the documentary.  What they were doing was that they were shitting while the guy was doing it.  Yeah.  They said CBS executives called and made him the all-time winning, one-time champion, so  he couldn't come back for days ahead.  So they said, okay, you won, where was it, like the hundred-something grand?  You're the one-time, all-time champion.  That was it.  They changed the rules on him.  Right on the spot.  Why wouldn't they, like, fix their fucking machine there?  Right.  They did. 
[01:43:30]  They did after that.  They added in a fuckload more possibilities.  Because this guy realized that there were only so many patterns.  So he memorized every one of those patterns so that if he saw, like, the sailboat light  up and then the whammy light up, he'd wait for that and go, all right, sailboat whammy.  Okay, now he starts counting.  Done, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.  And he looks around, looks, looks, looks.  Bam!  Hits it.  And every time.  Oh, my God.  Every fucking time.  It's so stressful.  He said he was getting so stressed out that he thought he was going to blow it at some 
[01:44:00]  point.  So he's concentrating so hard.  And he said it was one of the most stressful fucking things.  But if he got away, I mean, would he have lost all his money or just you?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, you do.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's why people don't make a lot of money on that show.  That's why, yeah.  As it was happening, they realized something was amiss.  And all these executives started losing their fucking minds going, this guy is raking us  and we know it.  But CBS, what great TV that is.  What dummies.  And didn't they have an engineer that told the executives this is a pattern?  Maybe.  Maybe they were like, ah, there's four different patterns. 
[01:44:30]  No one's going to get four patterns.  All right.  Let's listen to this.  Do you think, was that what he would do?  He would recognize the first one and have to count?  Yeah.  He would look at a pattern and then see a certain, like a corner and a middle lights up.  Okay.  Say the corner and the middle lights up and he'd be like, okay, go, now I know what pattern  it is.  He'd start looking at the pattern and know exactly when, after a certain thing, it would start  repeating itself again and know when to hit.  Okay.  He'd fucking brilliant to figure it out.  That's a math guy, man.  Yeah, it has to be.  Let's watch this.  He's a good chess player. 
[01:45:00]  That's the first spin.  First spinning at a whammy?  Yeah.  Yeah, I think he did that on purpose.  I need lots of money.  Come on.  Go.  Stop.  Stop.  At $1,250.  See, look at how he's concentrating.  Stop.  You can see him studying the floor.  And you can see when he hits it, he goes, stop, like he's timing it.  $4,000 on his spin.  No one else.  No one else did it like this.  Stop for us any time.  Stop.  Stop.  All right.  Pause.  He's in the exact same fucking square every time. 
[01:45:30]  Oh, yeah.  That's hilarious.  That's when the executive's like, holy shit.  He knows something.  It's not every single time, but it's 90% of the time.  It's the same fucking cube on the board.  Wow.  Yeah.  He's not moving around the board.  The same fucking square is lighting up every time.  Hit it.  Oh, he's looking for more big bucks.  Stop.  Stop.  That's the first one.  I think it's either that one or the other one.  What are you?  Stop.  Stop at Kauai.  Michael, a crypto Kauai.  That's spin seven.  $14,000. 
[01:46:00]  $14,000.  $136,000 on the line.  Stop.  Stop at $4,000.  What a hunk of change to ride.  Stop.  Stop at $500 in spin.  $18,000.  Oh, $18,000.  Stop.  Gutsy.  $700 in spin.  Michael, are you ready?  Yes, I'm ready.  Two Michaels going in at $19,000.  $336,000.  Let's get some big bucks.  Stop.  $1,000.  Oh, my God.  And they were just panicking backstage.  Look at him.  He knows.  He's got to wait. 
[01:46:30]  Oh, nervous laugh.  Stop.  Stop at $750 in.  He was almost fucked that time.  You can read it.  Yeah.  You can kind of read his mind now.  You can see his mind working.  Michael.  Like, if he counts one, two, three, now it will land.  Yeah.  Pause.  Wow.  So what is he up to at this point?  $26,000.  $26,000.  No one gets to even $26,000.  No, no, no.  Nobody got to five figures on that show.  Yeah, it's just you hit the whammy.  That's it.  And can you just bail?  Did he win the $100,000, or did they just give it to him? 
[01:47:00]  Like, how much had he won before these fucking assholes?  I think he won it.  Oh, he won the $100,000?  Yeah, and the show was over.  And they changed the rules on him?  So he couldn't come back the next day, right?  Yeah.  So they, he.  Yeah.  Wow, all right.  He made him the champ.  I don't know.  This guy's just fucking cheating.  Stop.  Pick a corner.  $2,250.  $1,500 in a spin or $2,000.  $2,000.  $2,250.  $2,250.  $2,250.  You got it, Michael.  I can't even see where it starts.  I know.  Michael says, let's go.  Unbelievable. 
[01:47:30]  Yeah, it is.  Stop.  Stop, guys.  Savills.  Pretty cool, huh?  Yeah.  Michael, you're at $29,000.  $29,000.  $3,500.  $3,500.  And you're going to keep going?  This is what we call the show, Press Your Luck.  No!  Three grand.  Another three grand.  He's just like, fuck you, motherfucker.  Pause.  Now he's feeling it because he's already celebrating.  Have you noticed?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's starting a celebration.  It's true.  It was a split second because he just knows. 
[01:48:00]  Dude, they brought that up in the show, too.  I just saw it.  He starts celebrating before he even fucking knows what he hit.  Yeah, he knew.  Yes.  The celebration is slightly before he actually knows what it is.  Let's see that.  Let me see that one.  How do you not hit the wrong button in a panic moment?  I know.  Well, he said that was a thing that he had to think about.  Oh, this guy rules.  Both hands over it.  This is what we call a show, Press Your Luck.  Watch the celebration.  Split second before.  Yeah, because he knows. 
[01:48:30]  He's all cocky.  He hit it with his elbow and his ankles and his nose.  You want to keep going with this?  16 spins.  Can we jump forward?  Yeah, go forward a little bit.  I don't know.  I kind of like it.  You want to keep watching it?  No, that's fine.  That's fine.  All right.  Now we're up to how many spins?  29 spins.  29 spins.  Do you think the people around him wanted to choke him?  Oh, the people that he played with probably were pissed as fuck.  I can see Everett Koopas winning all this money.  Keep going.  Keep scrolling forward.  No, no, no, no.  That's good.  Yeah, let's see what it is.  Midway through spin 28. 
[01:49:00]  $500, $51.  29.  Stop!  Stop at five.  He's celebrating the second he hits it.  He's going, yeah!  What?  I don't care.  Whatever.  Here we go.  Stop!  Stop at 500.  And it's spin.  Michael, I've never seen anyone press their luck like you are.  And you are pressing your luck.  He's trying to make him stop.  He's like, you are pressing your luck.  Could you give him notes from the executives?  Yeah.  You got to stop this shit. 
[01:49:30]  Stop for it!  He's here in his earpiece.  Yeah, this guy's a cheating motherfucker.  He's cheating.  We can see him fucking cheating.  Hey, come on.  Tell me you're really pressing your luck.  Do something.  Do fucking something.  You're the host.  We're losing fucking money.  It's going to come out of your check.  You fucking asshole.  Tackle him.  It probably said, oh, look, call for Mr. Happy.  Call for Mr. Happy.  Keep going.  Open the fucking door with his head.  Going again.  How do you? 
[01:50:00]  I can't see what it started.  I know.  That's why he was amazing.  Stop at $5,000 and a steal.  You're at $61,000.  And change.  Oh, nerves of steel.  $4,000.  Another $4,000.  He knows that one spot.  The one spot.  He loves that one spot.  But he's trying to mix it up a little bit.  You know you have over $55,000?  Not anymore.  You do.  What are you going to do?  Again.  Unbelievable. 
[01:50:30]  Wow.  Now, what is he seeing light up?  It's a guy.  Oh, wait.  He could have stopped at any time, right?  Yeah.  And then he would have been the champion and he would have been able to come back or no?  No.  Then you give up, I think.  If you stop, you're done, right?  No, because he still wouldn't have the most money.  As long as you have the most money, you still win.  I guess so.  The point of stopping is so you don't hit a whammy and lose everything.  But why would he think?  He would just think, hey, I'm going to keep going until the end and I come back and I'll  do it again.  Fuck him.  But wait a minute.  He got greedy.  Would he have had to start with $65,000 the next day?  Like, if he had stopped right here, could he have started the next day from zero? 
[01:51:00]  So if he lost, he wouldn't have lost anything.  I'm just trying to figure out.  Yes, yes.  Yeah, you keep your days winning.  So that was stupid.  Yeah, I'm thinking he should have milked it for a few days.  But they may have.  I mean, $65,000 already is so much over what they usually give out.  They probably would have thrown him off the show anyway.  I'll keep this going.  This is amazing.  You should see this fucking kook's face.  Yeah.  Stop!  Stop at $5,000.  He loves hitting that $5,000. 
[01:51:30]  They're so sick of clapping, these people.  Yep.  The woman next to him is clapping for him with her measly $4,000.  This guy has $70,000.  Enough of this guy.  I don't even think the contestants got up to $20,000 in general.  No.  No, they rarely broke five figures.  They would get like $5,000.  Yeah.  Shit like that.  It's like $5,000 and then you lose it to your whammy or your ass.  Maybe close to $10,000, maybe, right?  Maybe.  Like $8,000.  This guy's up to $70,000.  Yeah.  What was the host saying?  Five times. 
[01:52:00]  Oh.  Without a whammy.  Oh.  Stop!  $4,000 and a spin.  Michael, you have rolled 31 times.  He's also making sure he says stop because they told him to.  But you could tell he hits the button like he's already stopped when he says stop.  Stop!  Like he's completely concentrating on that button and the electronics and everything.  Yeah.  So.  Yeah.  I love this.  It was such a great fucking scam this guy pulled.  He probably just figured he knew that they knew something was up.  So he's just got to stay in that chair as long as he can still making money because he's not getting. 
[01:52:30]  He knew he wasn't going to get back.  Because the odd thing is like maybe because I'm so not a pattern oriented guy but I'm watching this and I know there's a pattern and I can't.  It's like it started.  It's in the middle.  I'm lost.  Stop.  Whammy.  How do you fuck?  I can't comprehend this.  He sat and watched fucking.  I think they said he did.  He like video.  He VHS the shows and would watch each fucking time and look for a pattern.  Rewind.  Watch the same board again.  Same board again. 
[01:53:00]  And he figured it out.  We got some great phone calls coming in.  I didn't know about this, Sam.  This is great.  This guy's fucking amazing.  Jonathan in Jersey.  Go ahead.  Hey, morning, boys.  Morning.  If you watch the documentary towards the end, he like fucks up and hits stop and where it landed wasn't a whammy.  But typically that spot was a whammy.  Oh, yeah.  And he like fucking walked out.  Yeah, he did get lucky that one time because he was just so exhausted by that point.  He was shot.  But wait, if you win free spins and he won a bunch of free spins, a whammy wouldn't have stopped him, right? 
[01:53:30]  It means you can spin.  Oh, yeah, I would have.  Yeah, it means you can spin again, but you lose all your money.  You lose all your money.  Oh.  Let's say how to do that.  So he did not want to hit a whammy.  He'd have to roll again and do another 31 times to get all that money.  Jason in Jersey, go ahead.  Come on, Jason.  Let's go.  Hey.  What's up?  Hi, buddy.  Hey, Jersey.  How you doing, man?  Hey, man.  I watched that documentary, too, and it was funny because he was just on a roll, and I 
[01:54:00]  think the game show host had some kind of, they told him that the guy was in on it, so  he was trying to slow him down at one point, and he was like, hey, Don, you know, how's  your personal life?  And he was like, stop!  He was in such a groove that he didn't want to hear any fucking thing else.  No shit.  Yeah.  Yeah, and he ended up losing that money because he fucked up, and he ended up picking, I don't  know, some other shit.  I think he picked a whammy eventually or something happened.  All right.  But it screwed him up.  I'm hearing a different story.  Thank you, sir.  Chris in Ohio. 
[01:54:30]  Oh, yeah.  I remember this, too.  You do?  Yeah.  Chris, go ahead.  Yeah, man.  I was watching that biography a while back.  What happened was he left some of his money in his house, and he got fucking robbed.  Yeah.  They had him on a biography.  So he walked away with his money, and then he got robbed.  And then someone stole his money.  Wow.  Oh, good.  Yeah, yeah.  He's a fucking dumbass.  Why would you get it in cash, asshole?  Put it in the bank.  I don't trust you.  Stop!  Sorry.  Let me say hi to James in Calgary.  A lot of people know about this thing.  He doesn't put it in the bank.  I know.  It's done. 
[01:55:00]  I can't wait to watch this later.  Gotta watch it.  Go ahead, James.  Yeah, this guy from the game show, from the documentary, he was a bit of an extrovert.  I think he had just lost his job, too, like three weeks before he was on the game  show.  And he had no friends or anything like that.  On top of it, he only actually had to learn, like, 16 patterns.  I remember from the documentary, there's only 16 patterns in the way it was set up.  So, I mean, he watched it for, like, 200 hours, and that was it.  He had it figured out.  That's a lot of patterns, though, 16. 
[01:55:30]  When Ant said four, it scared me.  Yeah, no, 16 patterns.  16 is horrifying.  And then they changed it to, like, get into the hundreds of thousands of patterns.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Was he addicted to scratch-offs, too, I'm hearing?  Oh, was he?  Yeah, I think they said something about that, too.  I'm not...  I saw it a while ago.  It's great, though.  Oh, I fucking have something to watch today.  Gotta watch it.  Yeah.  What would he do?  Was it the first one that would hit?  Like, when he would watch the first light, or wherever that one...  He didn't have to catch the first light.  Oh, he didn't?  And if he did catch the first light, that's when you see him go, like, bam, he hits real  fast, because he knows exactly when to hit. 
[01:56:00]  But when he's watching it go, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, for a while, he's waiting  for a combination of lights to tell him which pattern it is.  So he'll watch and go, okay, I didn't catch the beginning, but, all right, there, it's the  corner, the middle, the left side.  He goes, okay, now I know it's like pattern fucking...  So it's corner middle...  Pattern 10, so...  Corner, middle, left, he would go, one, two, boop.  Then he'd know exactly when to hit, to not hit a whammy.  Let's continue watching this.  He's up to 31 spins without a whammy. 
[01:56:30]  This is pressure luck.  80s graphics.  Yeah, 1984, was it?  Yep.  All right.  Without a whammy, 31 times.  We're going to press again.  Oh, big bucks, please.  Please, yeah, right.  He does hit that top fucking...  Top one alive.  Stop at five.  He's celebrating. 
[01:57:00]  He's going to run over here.  Everyone else goes, no whammy, no whammy, big money, big money, no whammy.  He's staring like a mental patient at that point.  You can't sell those spins.  I don't want to give them away.  You don't want to give them away?  You've got $75,000 more than Jane.  Here we go.  $79,000.  $351.  $33,000.  $4,000.  Jeez.  One hand-eye coordination, this guy has.  Up to $83,351.  Michael, $83,000. 
[01:57:30]  Fuck you, I'm going.  $3,000 and a spin.  Go again.  Oh, stop at $4,000 and a spin.  It's so obvious he's fucking them.  $90,000.  Go!  You're going to go again?  Go!  $90,000.  Fuck it, let me run.  $90,000.  We've never had anything like this before. 
[01:58:00]  Stop at $500,000 and a spin.  You can see him counting.  Yep.  The other people are actually really rooting for him now just to break the bank.  Fuck you.  Oh, luck be a lady.  $4,000.  Oh, my gosh.  That same spot over and over again.  $94,000.  Go again.  God damn.  He's like a mental patient.  $5,000 and a spin.  Go again.  Wow, the balls, man.  $44,000.  See, now he's going back to that spot because there's too much for lose. 
[01:58:30]  Yeah.  He's not moving it around anymore.  Oh, he passed.  That's what he did.  He finally said, I'm passing.  $102,000.  Almost $103,000.  And then doesn't the next person get a ramming?  Let's hope so.  On the first spin?  Let's fucking hope so.  Michael, you can do it.  You can do it.  Hit the board.  $4,080.  What the heck?  You only have $96,000 to go.  Total up to $93,85.  Yeah.  Passing, I'm okay.  All right, Michael. 
[01:59:00]  I didn't want to.  Now he's back again.  He's back.  $102,000.  Spin 45.  Oh, $106,851 on the line.  What's he doing?  And if you notice, the one guy had no money, so he hit a whammy.  Stop!  Stop at $750 and a spin.  I'm nervous.  You have to take, Michael, before we can deal with the earned spins.  Here's the last one you must take.  $107,000.  It's working.  Stop!  $101 a chip to the Bahamas.  Oh, that's.  Is that what he went?  Uh-oh. 
[01:59:30]  Rewind that a little bit.  Because he didn't want to take these spins.  And what does that bubble say?  Anything good?  You can tell Janie wanted Michael to take those spins, didn't you?  Oh, yeah.  Because when they get plus a spin, they can pass their spins.  If you get spins passed to you, you have to take them.  You have to take them.  And the reason that's important is because you might not want to take a spin because you could hit a whammy.  You got a lot of money.  You just want to sit there.  Now, I think you hear him go, uh-oh, when it hit.  Because that's the one that was supposed to hit a whammy.  Yeah, look. 
[02:00:00]  See?  See the whammies there?  Yeah, I think that's the first time that popped up.  The whammy all the way on the left.  The left in the middle.  And that's what he landed on.  He lands on it.  And I think you hear him go, uh-oh, like he fucked up and knew it.  Yep.  Go back a little bit.  Right here.  Hit it.  Yeah, go ahead.  Let's see.  Here's the last one you must take.  Yeah.  $107,601 a chip to the Bahamas.  Oh.  A chip to the Bahamas.  Let's see the Panic in the Bahamas.  Let me see.  He got lucky.  Is he watching the glowing light jump around or just the things lighting up? 
[02:00:30]  He's not watching the glowing light jump.  He's watching the actual things light, isn't he?  He's watching whatever it is that when you hit that button, it stops on.  So I guess it's the lights.  Yeah.  I guess it's the lights.  But is the pattern?  No, no, no.  Because it's so distracting.  There's a bunch of squares.  If you can't, you can't see it at home.  A bunch of squares.  And it's like light light.  It's so random all over the place.  Is he watching that or is he watching one part of the board which tells him? 
[02:01:00]  Hmm.  Well, that's good.  He might just be watching one part of the board which Eddie Pattern can be picked up from.  Waiting for.  Yeah.  I'm not sure.  Because it seems like it would be easier to watch one of three squares whammy trip money  and then you know it's going to land up there instead of looking at the fucking thing as  a whole.  He explains it in the documentary a little better.  Or somebody does anyway.  And they try to say that he cheated and they were trying not to pay him out.  Oh, fucking.  That's cheating.  Figured it out.  Yeah.  47 spins. 
[02:01:30]  $107,000.  He just fucked up.  Yeah.  So he's.  We're almost at the end of the club.  So he's passing.  He passes right over.  $10,000.  $237,000.  They go to you, Janie.  Two pass.  One at a time.  Here they come, Janie.  $93.85.  Come on, Big Bucks.  You've got a long way to go.  Come on.  Stop.  Stop at $750.  All right.  Big Bucks.  She's an idiot because she's looking at the screen trying to see what he sees.  Yeah.  Did you see that?  She was looking like, yeah, I got this down too.  Like a little word that says now is going to pop up. 
[02:02:00]  Hit it now.  She looks like fucking her Blair hair from Facts of Life.  Go ahead, bitch.  You can tell they're not prepared for this because there's only so many characters on  the screen.  Yeah.  And there's no room for the dollar sign on his screen anymore because they're not prepared  for six figures.  They had to make the one from the dollar sign.  $110,237.  Wow.  That's why he kept spinning.  You're at $10,135, Janie.  Michael is at $110,237. 
[02:02:30]  To say the least, you will have to get something that gives you an additional spin in order  to stay in this game and continue because CBS will relinquish its entire daytime schedule  for this show to go on if you keep going.  Are you ready, Janie?  Yeah.  Is it Michael going to hold on to that $110,000?  Let's see, Janie.  Come on.  Stop it.  And that's the proof.  What's the difference, Janie?  Michael.  Michael Larson wins.  Look at the cheesy graphics.  Three exclamation points. 
[02:03:00]  Yeah.  Yellow lights.  We'll be back.  We'll be back.  They're like, we'll be back.  I've got people to talk to.  $47,000.  $110,000.  Sailboat.  Bahamas.  Hawaii.  They tried to disqualify him.  They couldn't really cheat until he got his earnings.  Good.  He lost his money in real estate.  Christmas robbery after handing out $1 bills in a radio contest.  His wife divorced him.  He went on the run from the SEC. 
[02:03:30]  Paws out.  Died dose of throat cancer and died on February of 1999.  He was 49 years old.  Oh, shit.  Goddamn.  I'll see.  Wait, wait, wait.  He was 49 in 99?  What?  Because that was 84?  15 years ago, he was 34.  So we're looking at a 34-year-old there?  He's totally gray.  There's no way that guy's 34.  That's a 34-year-old.  What the fuck out of here?  He's totally gray.  He's got, like, jowls.  Maybe he's 49 there and he was, who knows?  I don't know.  Holy shit.  That's going to be wrong. 
[02:04:00]  Jesus.  Wow.  His fucking wife divorced him.  He was an unemployed ice cream truck driver from Ohio.  What a great, great story.  The documentary is great, though.  I can't wait to watch it.  Watch that because it's got a bunch of interviews with the people, the host of the show.  They really kind of delve into it.  The documentary.  What was it for originally?  Do you know?  It was just for him.  It was the situation.  Not from, you know.  Michael Larson.  The situation.  Look it up on YouTube if you want to check out the documentary.  I certainly will be later today. 
[02:04:30]  Yeah.  It says he was 49 when he died.  So, yeah.  It's Wikipedia.  It's not like it's, you know.  But we're looking at a 34-year-old.  That's no way.  That's 34.  It can't be.  That is a fucking hard 34, man.  Yep.  Wow.  Okay.  We've got Chris Hardwick coming in.  The Nerdist will be in studio in a half hour.  Yeah, from Attack of the Show on G4.  Eric has something special to play to break.  Oh.  Uh-oh.  It's good.  I'm not throwing him under the bus.  All right. 
[02:05:00]  Let's do it, then.  You've got 30 seconds, Papa Rock, to make Francine say what's on the paper, okay?  He's thinking.  All right.  What is it?  Whisper it to everybody, Jimmy, out there in Radio Land.  Things on a plane.  You didn't hear that, did you, Francine?  Things on a plane.  All right.  Here we go.  Here's Papa Rock.  Go.  Stewardess.  What?  Airplane.  Things on a plane.  Oh, wait a minute. 
[02:05:30]  But it wasn't you.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  Yeah.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Seems like people enjoyed the Press Your Luck segment.  Dr. Steve.  Yes.  Oh, I thought he only writes me.  No.  Oh, I got the Dr. Steve text, too.  How about you write us personally?  I didn't get one.  What is he? 
[02:06:00]  He sent out one mass text to all of us?  No, they were separate ones.  Oh, wait.  Yeah?  What does yours say?  Pardon me.  Well, I thought I had a special relationship with this fuck.  Yeah.  Does it start out with, that was fucking fascinating?  Yeah.  Oh, shit.  Do you have it in?  Let's.  Okay.  Here we go.  One.  Oh, you want to just read it at the same time?  If this is the exact same text, my relationship with Dr. Steve is over.  Okay, you ready?  Yeah.  One, two, three.  That was fucking fascinating. 
[02:06:30]  I love it when you guys analyze some weird media event.  No one does it better.  Your Valtrex is ready.  He sent the same text to all of us?  Are you fucking serious?  Are you fucking serious?  Son of a bitch.  I know.  I like how Jimmy pumped it up and made it into a gag.  Valtrex is ready.  But the reality is he sent us the same fucking text message.  I'm thinking I have a personal fucking friendship with this guy.  Yeah.  Black Island.  He's no better than fucking Club Sartacani.  Did you get his goddamn toenail fungus? 
[02:07:00]  This shit is getting for the old and he's got to get him pulled out with pliers?  No.  He's on his way right now?  No.  Oh, I got the special one.  Yeah, you got to go with it.  That means he likes you more.  Oh, yeah.  Did you get the one, the photo of the, she's like eight.  He goes, look what came into the office today.  That's an upskirt shot.  My relationship with him is over.  Oh.  Over.  No need to hate.  I'm not hating.  I think you're hating.  You can't send the same exact text.  It is.  He copy pasted that shit. 
[02:07:30]  You don't copy paste.  We called him out on it.  I'm trying to show Anthony a picture from I Like Girls Daily.  Yeah.  I know this has nothing to do with the radio show.  I Like Girls Daily.  But this fucking, and I'm in contact with her.  She's got to fucking make sure she doesn't go too hardcore.  Don't go hardcore.  Yeah?  Yes.  You're right where you should be.  Here it is.  Hot girl with dirty mirror.  All right.  Oh, boy.  A still pick.  Look at this fucking.  Oh.  All right.  Yeah, it's pretty goddamn hot. 
[02:08:00]  It's good, right?  That whole mirror camera thing is.  And you keep the panties on.  You're not showing the pink.  No.  Take the panties off.  I want to see the pussy lips.  No, you don't have to with the I Like Girls Daily.  But I want to.  Who wants to see underwear when you can see a twat?  Speaking of twats, Lindsay Lohan.  Isn't she fucking hateable, dude?  I fucking hate her.  She's the worst.  I fucking hate her.  Not as much as Kim Kardashian, but the hate is way the fuck up there.  I guess Playboy's not happy with the photo shoot. 
[02:08:30]  Oh, right, right.  That's what I heard.  She's doing the entire Lindsay Lohan photo shoot for Playboy.  That's how much of a slob she is.  And I'm sticking with it.  It didn't come out well.  I'm sticking with it.  She has bad breath.  I'm convinced of it.  You think so?  Yes.  We met her.  I can't remember at XM.  She was beautiful when we met her.  She was okay.  She was unmade up.  She was really beautiful back then.  A natural beauty.  Now she's doing all sorts of fucking weird shit.  And I don't remember exactly. 
[02:09:00]  The hair's too blonde.  What else?  I guess that's all she's doing.  It's probably the...  No, the shoot came out really shitty.  Somebody bashed the shit out of it.  Yeah.  Called her nipples pale, wet weasel noses.  What?  Wait, this is coming out?  No, it was somebody that was blogging about it.  I don't know.  I don't mind fucking wet weasel nipples. 
[02:09:30]  I just hate it because the amount of chances she gets to get her shit together, that's  what drives me nuts.  And if it was anyone else.  Anyone else.  Including us, by the way.  Including us.  We would never get...  How many chances?  Lots.  Way too fucking many, man.  Why is that?  Because she's a celebrity in Hollywood?  Because she's famous and they don't see it doing any good, really.  Really?  They're just hoping she ODs and it's over.  They don't have to deal with her anymore.  What's going on with the Michael Jackson fucking doctor?  Oh, Michael died. 
[02:10:00]  I guess.  Oh.  No.  They kind of kept it under wraps.  They got...  Conrad Murray.  Yeah.  The jury's got it now?  Yes.  Isn't it?  Yes.  It goes like any other LA high profile trial.  He's fine.  No, he's sunk.  We'll see.  He's fine.  Yeah.  Conrad Murray's in trouble.  You think?  Is he?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think so.  Probation?  Old Conrad.  Lose his license?  What are we looking at?  I don't know if he'll go to jail.  No, I don't think he'll go to jail.  I think that he'll lose his license.  Tremendous civil suit.  Well, who the fuck would go to him anyway? 
[02:10:30]  Yeah.  At this point.  I would, because what are the odds from doing it again?  It doesn't matter if they take his license.  I would imagine his clientele is a bit...  You think it's going to suffer?  Oh, my God.  Reputation tarnished.  Rumor has he didn't even know how to do CPR.  No.  Someone else had to do the CPR if I was watching the trial correctly.  He goes, does anybody here know CPR?  And people are like, oh, we thought that was your fucking gig.  Try giving the man UPS. 
[02:11:00]  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  We got an update on Michael Larson, the Press Your Luck guy.  Yeah.  By the way, Heather, hi.  Bravo on your tweet.  Where the fuck are you today?  What the fuck, she writes.  Could anything else bad happen to this guy?  Was he playing Press Your Luck in the Twilight Zone?  Ooh.  Because a lot of shit happens to this guy after the show.  Yeah, so he invested.  His money went to taxes, of course, and then some of it went into real estate, which turned  out to be a Ponzi scheme, so he lost the entire investment.  Then he found out, like a radio station was doing a serial bid, a serial number, find it 
[02:11:30]  on the dollar, win $30,000.  Fugitive?  It's a fugitive thing, yeah.  And so he took all...  Oh, he wasn't spending that money.  He was just looking at his...  It's an old radio bid, and I even redid it for my dumb YouTube channel.  Basically, you announce a serial number, and if you have that dollar, you win that amount  of money.  In this case, it was $30,000 you could win.  Right.  So he figured, holy fuck, I won all this money, so I'm going to turn it all into $1 bills  to increase my odds of possibly having the serial number. 
[02:12:00]  Okay.  So he took out all his money in $1 bills.  How much?  $40,000?  And he had them in the house.  Yeah.  $40,000 in ones.  He went to a Christmas party, and he left $40,000 in bagged $1 bills in the house.  Upon returning, he and his wife saw that their house had been broken into, and all the money  was stolen.  Whoops.  He accused his wife of stealing the money.  Inside job, of course.  Oh, God, yeah.  You don't know there's $40,000 fucking singles in the house.  Yeah, singles in the house.  So she divorced him around the mid-'90s. 
[02:12:30]  He got involved in an illegal scheme to sell part of a nationwide lottery.  As a result, Larson went on the run, leaving Ohio.  His family contacted by the U.S. Securities, SEC, and IRS, and FBI, but nobody knew where he  was.  He died of throat cancer in Florida in 99, and that is when his family found out where  he had been after he died.  Wow.  Wow.  It's a terrible race.  Just a horrible life.  I mean, just that one moment that we saw him celebrating. 
[02:13:00]  That was the happiest moment of his life.  Everything else was shit.  Moral of the story, don't cheat, and don't live with any lies.  That's right.  And he's stealing bitches.  Don't live with any lies.  Nope.  And that relates to actually you and...  It'll cause the cancer.  You and E-Rock.  I mean, that actually relates to what happened with you and E-Rock yesterday.  You gotta get that shit out of your soul.  Yeah.  It was infesting you.  That's right.  Yeah.  Weighing heavy.  Weighing heavy.  E-Rock's not laughing.  I know. 
[02:13:30]  He'll laugh again.  Aw.  He'll get a smile back.  Yeah, he'll get a smile back.  He'll smile at some point.  Smiles, everyone.  Now this.  Oh.  It's a great thing for history.  George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, William Howard Taft, and President Barack Obama.  One young girl traced them all back to one common ancestor.  They're all cousins and all grandsons of John Lachlan.  It's the first family tree of its kind, pouring through more than half a million names for months. 
[02:14:00]  Twelve-year-old Bridge Ann D'Avignon discovered that all the U.S. presidents, except Martin Van Buren, are related to the former king of England, John Lachlan Plantagenet, signer of the Magna Carta in 1215.  Mildred Reed is his first great-grandmother on George Washington, and on Obama, Mildred Reed is the tenth great-grandmother.  It started as an assignment to research her own lineage, tracing it back to roots in France. 
[02:14:30]  But Bridge Ann wanted to branch out.  Well, I think we just all go back somewhere.  It's just a matter of proving it.  She started with George Washington, but unlike other professional genealogists that only looked at the male family lines,  Bridge Ann was able to link the presidents together using both male and female ancestry.  Before this, historians had only been able to link 22 family trees.  She kind of created a triumph of women's studies here. 
[02:15:00]  Bridge Ann also figured out she's an 18th cousin of President Obama, something she hopes to be able to share with him in person.  I've written a letter to Obama, but I've just gotten standard reply.  I hope to meet the president and, like, explain it to him.  That's fucking...  Is that the crazy broad?  Unless everybody is related somehow.  Yeah.  How are fucking every but one president related to the old king of England?  Yeah, that's weird.  That's weird.  Is that true, though? 
[02:15:30]  Uh, dumb little broad says so.  It seems so.  Unless we all are.  You do your genealogy, we're all related to some dumb fucking important king or something.  Dude, that's pretty fucking, uh...  I'm not an Illuminati guy.  At all.  I don't know.  That's kind of crazy.  Even though they've asked me to perform at their Christmas parties, I'm always busy.  Illuminati.  You know, stiff that'd be.  Anthony.  Yes.  People are confused.  I like Girls Daily.  All I'm saying is she doesn't have to go with the hardcore stuff. 
[02:16:00]  Of course she should be showing pussy.  Will you relax out there?  Yeah, yeah.  Guys are losing their fucking minds.  Pussy.  I like that it looks like it's more natural girls in, like, natural environments.  That's what I'm saying.  Don't like the stripper look.  No.  Don't like that shit.  No, it's cool when you think they're in a, you know, a college dorm or something.  Right.  That's all I'm saying.  Taking a picture in their fucking bath.  His underpants.  Holy mother of God.  Yeah, that's completely fine.  Her asshole is wide open.  Okay, relax.  That's not what I'm saying.  That's disgusting.  But I like when it's... 
[02:16:30]  I like when it feels like it could be just a regular girl.  You know what I mean?  A good-looking regular girl.  Like that.  Wow.  That's all I'm saying.  Relax.  There are so many pictures of nude girls out there.  Oh, yeah.  It's just astounding, the amount of girls that are taking naked pictures of themselves.  Fascinating.  I wish they were all sending them to me.  Mm-hmm.  Whoa.  The hell is that?  What the fuck?  Look at her.  She's doing a little somersault.  Having fun.  A little pose?  That's yoga. 
[02:17:00]  That's yoga.  Should be the poster for yoga.  Fucking porn.  Goddamn porn is great.  See?  See, she's looking a little stripper-ish, a little greased up.  She's a nice fat vagina, though.  Look at her.  Yeah, of course.  Yeah.  You could punch it.  So she just lifted something really heavy.  Put it on your eye when you have a black eye.  Yeah.  Like a steak.  Let's say hi to Justin.  He has more on than Lindsay Lohan's pussy lips.  Lilo.  Lilo.  Justin.  Lilo. 
[02:17:30]  Lilo, sir.  Oh, morning, boys.  Yeah, what's up?  Morning.  This is for Jimmy.  It's not about Lindsay Lohan.  It's I like girls.  Go through her timeline to yesterday.  There is a picture, like she calls it, it says, at the beach.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It's Lindsay Lohan?  It's totally, you know.  I like girls.  It's not.  Yeah.  But it's totally for Jimmy.  Because, I mean, her lips are damn near down to her knees.  Oh, for Pete's sakes.  I've got to see this.  Yeah, and Jersey Rick on Twitter, he spells Jersey very, very differently. 
[02:18:00]  I don't have time to fucking spell it out, but he writes, he likes the real pics, too.  The stage ones, professional ones, not good.  Love the natural ones, too.  Who doesn't?  That's all I'm saying.  Yeah.  That's all I'm saying.  Yeah.  That's all I'm trying to say here.  Keep it natural.  Keep it natural.  As much as possible.  Those mirror shots, the bed shots, things like that, great.  You can see kind of dorm room shit in the background.  Oh, my God.  That type of thing.  That type of thing.  That stuff's good.  I'm not a fan of the pictures from the green room at the strip club.  No.  No.  I like the fucking fake hair and the fucking greasy fake tits. 
[02:18:30]  That's all I was saying.  So let's all calm down.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm not going to ruin I Like Girls Daily.  She's doing a great job on her own.  Is that a girl who does that?  That's probably a guy.  I think it's a girl.  I hope so.  I think we're supposed to get her on the show or something.  Is it really a girl?  You don't think so?  Probably not.  What are the odds?  She gives the impression that she's a bisexual.  Oh, yeah?  Mm-hmm.  We should break so we can get Chris Hardwick in here.  You want to do that?  Yes.  And Sam's going to find that picture for Jimmy. 
[02:19:00]  So Chris Hardwick is next, promoting his book, The Nerdist Way, How to Reach the Next Level in Real Life, in bookstores now and Amazon.  Kenny.  Kenny.  Two minutes.  Tickets will be on sale.  Oh, my God.  Tickets.  Yay!  By the way, Ant, we almost got T-boned by a massive truck on the way home yesterday.  What happened?  Is he driving unsafely?  We decided we wanted to call Sam's show, and he decided to make a phone call and decided he didn't need to pay attention to the lights anymore. 
[02:19:30]  Oh, he almost went through a red light?  Can you make that thing, Sam?  Oh, yeah, there's two pretty girls smiling.  They must not know their vaginas are out.  Yeah, sure.  Wow, that's like...  That's a lot of shit.  Oh, that's fucking...  I love that.  That's a lot of shit.  When she goes swimming, the fish go up to her and go...  Take little nibbles at it.  You like that, huh, Jimmy?  I like a lot going on down there.  Yeah, but...  Might be a little too much going on down there.  I like it a little fatter and like that, but there's one girl I've known in my life who had a... 
[02:20:00]  It's like simply...  It's one I can think of, and it makes my head hurt.  It was so big.  Like, I just...  It's so fucking obscenely large.  Sure thing.  And feminine.  It was just a big, giant vagina, man.  Big, giant vaginas are feminine?  But not deep.  Oh, yeah.  It was fucking so hot.  She was so dirty.  Sweaty.  15 seconds.  Oh.  You want to be on the air when it officially happens, Kenny?  Here it goes.  10! 
[02:20:30]  Count down.  Can you count that guy?  You can't count from 10?  10!  5!  You suck at being dramatic.  There it is.  At the tone, the time is 9 o'clock.  Tickets are on sale now.  For what?  For what?  Borgata.com.  Comcasttix.com.  Anti-social comedy at the Borgata.  Saturday, January 14th.  Who's performing, though?  Yeah, who?  Anti-social people.  Jim... 
[02:21:00]  Hosted by Jim Norton.  Doug Stanhope, Dave Attell, and the return of Artie Lang.  It's a fucking huge show.  Holy fuck.  Yeah, it's a good show.  That's going to be a good one.  Yeah.  And I'll be selling merchandise.  So save money for a t-shirt.  Jimmy Norton.  Yeah, the last episode of Always Sunny in Philly, Jimmy, they did anti-social.  I heard that.  It's called Anti-Social Network.  Yeah, it's a play on the movie, though. 
[02:21:30]  It's like...  There was an overwhelming demand for pre-sale tickets, you know.  Yeah, I was saying that before.  TheBorgata.com.  Oh, Sam, you're such a twat.  Sam!  I followed the plug.  All right.  I got excited.  The Borgata of Scottsdale?  It's TheBorgata.com.  Yeah, TheBorgata.com or Comcast Tix.  T-I-X.  Ooh.  All right.  All right.  You know, in the event center, the big room. 
[02:22:00]  The big room.  Because it's a big show.  Oh, hell yeah.  All right.  We're going to break.  Chris Hardwick joins the show next.  Yes.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Happy birthday to Ron from Run-DMC.  53 years old today.  Welcome back to The Opie and Anthony Show.  Yep.  Hi.  I just made that up because it sounded like Run-DMC and usually it means a birthday. 
[02:22:30]  So was I right?  It is Run-DMC.  Oh.  What was the thing about Run-DMC then?  No.  We get topical in the first break.  Eric officially doesn't want to talk to me.  I understand that.  But can you talk for the show?  Or you ask him and then he'll answer.  E-Rock, any reason for the Run-DMC?  No.  Just the bed.  Just playing.  All right.  He didn't want to answer me.  Well, let me tell you how deep this goes.  Fucking Sam in the 10 o'clock hour is going to talk about something. 
[02:23:00]  Uh-oh.  I didn't remind him.  Sam goes, oh, remember that time you left E-Rock at Giant Stadium?  Oh, right.  Somebody on Twitter reminded me of it.  After what?  The Rolling Stones concert, was it?  I think so.  Yeah.  So E-Rock, when you guys talk about that in the 10 o'clock hour, remember that it was  Sam and not me.  No, I'm not the one who left him.  Yeah, but everyone forgot.  But you got all excited.  You were jumping up and down and went, oh, remember that time you did this to Eric too?  I didn't.  I'm going to talk about it in the 10 o'clock hour. 
[02:23:30]  I didn't jump.  I just read it on Twitter.  And it's not to be confused with the time that you left, or we, not we, they almost left  him at the Palisades during the homeless shopping spree.  Yeah.  Well, I, you know, I just promote your 10 o'clock hour.  Chris Hardwick in studio.  Hey, Chris.  Guys, how are you?  The Nerdist.  Good.  We just got these books.  I like to read a book before somebody comes in.  Yeah, we usually like to peruse.  To help promote it.  No, we do, though.  I'll try to read the book before somebody comes in, but I literally, we got handed this  this morning.  I don't know why we get them the, you know, a mere hour before the guest comes in. 
[02:24:00]  And it's always the way.  They always just pop the book down next to us and go, here, he's coming in.  Like, oh, great.  What am I supposed to do?  One minute.  Fucking speed read.  At this point, we've got to just read chapter titles and hope that sells the book.  It's a quick read.  High Anxiety.  There you go.  What is the, what is the, I was just going to push it, but what is it?  Is it a biography or no?  No, it's like a, it's a productivity book.  Oh, what?  It's a productivity book.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Productivity book.  Productivity.  Time management.  Mm-hmm.  Yes, yes.  About how to do what?  Well, it's, it's sort of. 
[02:24:30]  Oh, are we actually on the air now?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, I was just kicking back.  It's funny.  That montage.  I'll tell you guys, it's so casual in here.  Everybody says that.  Everybody says that.  Everybody says that.  I don't even have headphones on.  We're going to put together a montage.  We're doing a montage.  Yeah.  Of everyone that's come in here and said, are we on the air?  What if I was like, ah, when do we have to go on and make these pieces of shit happy?  What?  What?  We're on?  Oh, my God.  We say that all the time and we never do.  No, it's fun.  Please isolate that he just said that and put that in the intro.  Yeah.  Perfect.  Jesus, yeah.  No, but honestly, it's so nice and relaxed and casual in here. 
[02:25:00]  I just kind of like wander in.  I got scared like you weren't into it because you just sat back in his chair.  He threw his headphones off.  I'm like, oh, man, did we piss him off?  Yeah, no, no, no.  They're pretty casual, but that's the way we like it here.  I take my shoes off, relax.  The book's a productivity book because I was a complete fuck up in my 20s.  And I feel like the part of that was that I had sort of, you know, I was into, we've  talked about the chess stuff before.  You know, I was a huge, huge nerd growing up as a kid. 
[02:25:30]  Chess club, D&D, debate club, Latin club.  D&D, that's pretty fucking good.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And so, and I feel like I tried to get away from that in my 20s and I realized in my 30s,  like, those were the things that kind of made me who I was.  And those were, like, a nerd's innate power is to focus on something to a quantum detail.  But it's just that we don't always focus on constructive things.  So it's saying, like, you have this power to focus, and if you want to aim that at constructive  things, here's how I did it.  And hopefully, you know.  I got to start by.  The nerdist way. 
[02:26:00]  Wow.  That's you in 2003?  Yeah.  Whoa.  Holy shit.  I know.  It's in the introduction.  It's, well, it's a chubbier version of you in 2003.  Yeah, I was, I always say that's, I make up this, I say I had a brother.  That's my fuck-up brother, Peter.  Oh, my God.  I would swear that's not you.  I know.  Isn't that crazy?  It does look like a cousin or, like, a brother.  Yeah.  Looked like, you look like Billy and Jimmy Carter side by side.  Wow.  I can't fucking believe it.  How many, how heavy were you there? 
[02:26:30]  Oh, it was like, I mean, I was probably, like, 180, but, I mean, I'm, like, 145 now.  But the difference is that I have a thin frame, so I carry all my weight, like, in a sack around my neck and in my gut.  So, you see, if I get chubby, you see it right away.  It's horrible, right?  I can't hide it.  Yeah, it's not good.  I ate two cupcakes this morning, and all I'm doing is checking my side fat.  Just to see it hit?  Yeah, it's, like, really weird, man.  Are you obsessive like that?  Like, you obviously are in shape.  Well, I'm.  You have a terrific body. 
[02:27:00]  Oh, Jim, thanks.  I appreciate that.  Wait, I would assume, though, you were, you gained weight because of something happening in your life, or no?  Oh, because you weren't always 180.  No, no, no.  I mean, you know, what happened was, you know, I mean, I quit drinking in 2003, and I guess just, you know, before that, it's not only drinking every day, but when you drink every day, you also eat at, like, 4 o'clock in the morning.  And so, you know, it's, like, that contributes to, I was always a skinny teenager, and it just didn't occur to me that in my mid-20s, like, yeah, that stops. 
[02:27:30]  Your metabolism slows down a bit.  A lot of beer?  Was it a lot of beer?  Oh, my God, it was mammoth, like, unholy amounts.  So you felt like you had a problem?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, I did.  I mean, I know I did, and I never did drugs or anything.  It was just beer, but, like, you know, you drink, like, 15, 20 beers a day.  It's just, like, we're not evolved to handle that amount of alcohol.  Yeah, it's a case of beer almost.  It's a half case, a case of beer a day.  It's a lot.  It's pretty fucking crazy.  Seven days a week?  Yeah, yeah, usually, and everything I did revolved around it, and, you know. 
[02:28:00]  What time would you start drinking?  Like, if you got up, at what time would you start right after, or would you wait a while?  No, I would wait until, I mean, I would wait until the evening, you know.  You always have these weird ways of justifying your behavior.  Like, well, if I only do it when it's dark outside, then it's okay.  Exactly.  But in the last...  Then you're in Alaska.  Problem?  Yeah, exactly.  You have to keep jumping time zones.  It's a 24-hour schedule.  But, yeah.  It doesn't matter when you're flying.  It doesn't matter what time it is.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah, exactly.  The plane is its own time, so...  Wait, you're related to this ad? 
[02:28:30]  You can drink Bloody Mary's at, like, any time on the plane.  It's like being out in the open water.  Like, oh, there's no law.  Yeah, yeah, no law.  International law.  International law.  Not only can Anthony relate to it, he had wings put on his house.  See?  Just so he would always feel like, I'm playing with drunk.  There were moments the last year, though, where I would wake up at, like, 6 o'clock in the  morning, and I would drink a beer because I felt awful, like, and that was the only way  to feel better.  Medicinal beer.  And so I would, you know, as I was doing that, I would kind of laugh to myself and be  like, yeah, I don't think you're supposed to be doing this.  That's not good. 
[02:29:00]  And so, you know, what it was just sort of part of the...  Because one thing about nerds is that they're so introspective, and they have these hyper  internal monologues.  And I think a lot of the drinking was, you know, besides from having the weird alcohol  gene, was to try to silence some of that.  And so it was just part of the obsessiveness, and, you know, at least I was able to re-aim  some of that.  What makes a nerd, like, because it's like, I think the definition of quote-unquote nerd  or nerd culture has changed. 
[02:29:30]  Because you're a good-looking guy, you're a smart dude.  It's like, you know, when I was growing up, the definition of a nerd...  Wasn't Chris Hardwick.  No, it was like a social pariah.  It was a guy you didn't want to be around.  I was like, oh, that's fucking nerd.  Fonzie used to call them nerds.  There's nerd.  There's a couple...  You know, truthfully, and this is really...  I'm sad to say this, but I think a lot of the people in the 80s...  Because in the 80s, there were a lot of things we weren't aware of yet.  And I think a lot of people that we said were nerds actually had Asperger's.  I mean, for reals. 
[02:30:00]  For reals.  Yeah.  You know, like American Splendor, like the guy, the party nerd, the one that Judah Friedlander  played.  Yeah.  I don't remember that.  You're so right.  But anyway, but nerd culture, it was not a cool thing to do in the 80s.  And then now, when you realize that so much of what nerds create are kind of the foundations  of our culture in terms of technology and gaming and sci-fi and film, it sort of became a cool  thing because a lot of, you know, nerds became billionaires. 
[02:30:30]  And there's a difference between nerd and dork.  I think dorks are the ones we had a problem with.  Dorks, yeah.  Oh, fuck the dorks.  Dork is a stupid, shallow nerd.  Is it?  Like, I think a nerd has a little more smarts and is a little deeper in thought.  And a dork is just a dummy.  I'll tell you, because I get into this debate with people a lot where they go,  well, the one thing about being a nerd is that some people expect you to know everything  about everything in nerd culture.  And, you know, nerds tend to pick the things that they focus on.  And I don't think it's necessarily, it's not whether you watch Battlestar or Doctor Who 
[02:31:00]  or, you know, read DC or whatever.  Nerds do like those things.  I would say it's not what you like that makes you a nerd.  It's how you like it.  You know, like, it's how insanely passionate or focused you are on a thing and how, you  know, kind of unnaturally obsessed you are with it.  With that and the detail of it.  And the detail of it.  And the thing I think that makes a nerd is that they try to understand something more  than anyone else on the planet. 
[02:31:30]  And they want it into quantum, that quantum detail.  Do you understand quantum stuff?  Yeah.  But yeah, I do, actually.  I read, did you read The God Particle?  I most certainly did not.  No.  Not only.  They say it doesn't exist, though.  Oh, no.  But the Higgs boson.  That doesn't exist, or doesn't it?  Well, they believe that it exists because they don't know what it is.  They don't really understand what gives something mass.  And so they feel like there's this quark that they're trying to find, this subatomic  particle that they think will explain why things have mass. 
[02:32:00]  I was driving through Batavia, Illinois on tour once, and I saw Fermilab, which is before  the accelerator moved to CERN, that was the primary collider, was at Fermilab.  And I went in, and I'm like, oh, I write for Wired Magazine, which was true.  And so they gave me a tour.  Like, I wasn't really writing an article about Fermilab, but I dropped the Wired card and  got this amazing tour of Fermilab.  You know what?  I was reading about The God Particle recently, and I remember the article I read, I think  it was by somebody with a very religious slant, who didn't want The God Particle to exist. 
[02:32:30]  So I think that's why it was a negative article.  Oh, gotcha.  And he's quoting scientists saying, we don't know if there is one.  And I'm like, that's kind of biased.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, you know, it's, and when you start to, when you're talking about that kind of  physics, it's a particle, like, in a mathematical particle.  It's not like you can really see.  You got a little grain.  Yeah.  Oh, there it is.  Yeah, there it is.  Yeah, I dusted it.  I left my fucking hotel keys in The God Particle.  Let me know. 
[02:33:00]  Sorry, I cheated on you.  God Particle.  I don't know what to say.  I can't explain it.  I don't know what to say.  My tits had more God Particles than yours.  So I had to shoot God Particles into her face.  I would, yeah, I wish I knew more about this stuff.  Those are all God Particles.  Do you speak, do you speak, do you still play chess?  I haven't played in a while.  It's weird.  It's kind of hard for me to play now, Jim, because I was so, I mean, playing competitive  chess for so long, it makes it hard for me to play a casual game without getting so  intense about it.  You play chess with friends?  No, not so much.  Like, if I play, I'll play on my iPad or the iPhone, and I don't really, I don't, you 
[02:33:30]  know, none of my friends really play that much.  We should play on chess with friends, because guys like him would murder me.  Like, I'm a very average player, but I don't mind being, I love fucking, I love chess.  I can't comprehend, I love chess players.  I just love guys that can do it.  I bet you'd be good, though.  Nah, I really wouldn't.  You play a lot.  Nah, it doesn't matter.  What kind of chess players kill them?  What kind of tournaments, as a competitive chess player, did you, uh, well, just, you  know, just like, you go, you go, and it's usually like a rec room or a gym or something,  and it's just like, you know, it's just a, it's like a, you know, 200 chess boards, 
[02:34:00]  and all you can hear are the clanking of pieces on the board and the hitting of the  clock, and it's...  And then you win, and you go trick-or-treat.  Motherfucker.  Yeah, no, and it's, you know, it's always, it's like, the sort of, the psychological warfare  that happens in a, in a chess match is, is hilarious, because it's so much more devastating  than just being punched by a jock.  Yeah, like, they hit you, and then you bruise, and then that's it, but, but you sit down,  and a guy sitting across the board from you tries to climb inside your head and psych you 
[02:34:30]  out and figure out what you're going to do and manipulate you, and it, uh, it's, it's  fucked up.  What was something you saw that was, uh, that was like a cool, what was something somebody  would do that you, that you would do that was like a real psychological fuck?  There was this kid, um, when I was, when I was playing, you know, and this was in Tennessee,  and his father was like one of the rich guys in town, and this kid was so obnoxious, his  name was Gus Lipman, I don't know, I, hopefully he's still alive and, and nice now, but he  had these, like, tortoises, he was this really, like, preppy 11-year-old, and he had tortoises 
[02:35:00]  shell glasses, he wore this tiny little London fog coat and carried a briefcase, like 11-year-olds  do.  And so you'd sit down with him, and he'd cross the board from you, and he'd go, uh,  hey, hey, yeah, hey, you feeling okay?  You know, you look a little pale.  And then you would get mad, like, how fucking stupid does this guy think I am?  And then by the time you do that, your game, your head's out of the game.  But I did, I beat him for the, to win the Memphis Junior High City Chess Championship, and  that was one of the most amazing, fuck him and his briefcase, one of the most amazing 
[02:35:30]  victories of my young life, was fucking shutting that guy down.  That's pretty resigned, or did you made him?  Checkmate, and he looked, and I actually did, I, this was so shitty of me, but he, I, he  was visibly shaken near the end of the game, and I actually got to say to him, are you  feeling okay, Gus?  Oh, did you really?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  I want to know what Gus is doing now.  I don't know.  I would love to know what this kid's doing.  His father was a wealthy land developer in Memphis, I don't know what he's, what was his last  name?  Lipman.  He probably owns G4.  Oh, shit.  We're fired. 
[02:36:00]  No, that sucks.  I would love to know what a kid like that is doing nowadays.  Yeah, I don't know.  I don't know what he's doing.  And how much of Fisher's, Fisher always said he didn't believe in psychology, he believed  in good moves, but you got to say a little bit of bullshit, too, like, to not show up  for a game against Spassky, like, that fucking's got to play with your head when you're the  champion and the challenger just doesn't show up for a game.  Yeah, yeah, I mean, that's a sort of a, that's kind of a dick move.  I mean, it's, you know, like, you love that about Bobby Fisher because he was eccentric,  but, uh, but it's like, okay, come on, you know, like, face him like a man, like, don't 
[02:36:30]  play these games.  But then he's down two games to nothing and he fucking, like, it's just unheard of to  do that.  And that's got to fuck with you, like, as a champion where a guy just doesn't show up.  You have to, it's got to be in your head, like, there's something wrong.  Yeah, and then, even if you, even, but again, and even if you get mad at the, does he,  you know, how stupid does he think I am?  Like, any emotion that it evokes is, like, takes you down.  Probably negative, right?  Yeah.  Sure.  So, so that's, that's sort of why I wrote the book was just like, you know, like, homing 
[02:37:00]  in on all of these kind of nerdy, obsessive attributes and trying to aim that, aim that  laser at, uh, at good things.  Did you find anything about Gus Lipman?  Just an article that you had mentioned him in.  That I mentioned him in.  Yeah, that I wrote about the, about the, about the, about the, yeah.  But you can focus like that.  I mean, I'm amazed by guys that can, like, focus that type of, uh, mental energy on anything  without being distracted.  And you gotta work out your brain, obviously, to, to compete in chess.  You can't just jump in it again, I would assume.  Well, you have to, you know, it's, you sort, I mean, you know, there are certainly strategies 
[02:37:30]  that you can use.  There are certain defenses and there are certain offenses you can use.  But ultimately, every game I've always thought was unique.  And it just comes down to, for me, it was just trying to see 12 moves ahead of all the  pieces on the board.  And that, I think that contributed a lot to the overthinking that I did.  You know, so many nerds suffer from anxiety and depression and, and it's, it's just from  overthinking things.  And so many people never even start shit because they, how many people have asked you, how do  I get started in stand-up comedy?  And you're like, well, you just start, like, don't overthink it. 
[02:38:00]  I wouldn't know because if they walk up to me and they go, how do I, I immediately walk  away.  It could be anything.  How do I get to Carnegie Hall?  Whatever it is.  What if the question is, how do I get close to Jim Norton?  How do I, how do I get inside his heart?  Um, that's a good, you know, you know how much pussy I probably passed up from walking  away, girls with big tits, how do I?  I don't know.  I was going to fuck this guy's lights out and then he just walked away.  Yeah, you do though.  And it's a tough question.  I don't know what to say.  It's like, hey, go to an open mic.  You know, you just do it.  You don't overthink it.  If you sit around and, you know, people think themselves out of doing things all the time. 
[02:38:30]  You just got to do it, right?  Do you, uh, do you fall asleep with anything on like a TV or something?  Because I have to, because if I'm alone with my own thoughts, I'll never go to sleep.  Yeah, I'm constantly just thinking of things.  I have a, I have like a white noise app on my iPhone.  What is that, people working?  Oh, see, I, wow.  It's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a white noise.  Uh, it's a, I, uh, I can't support any of that. 
[02:39:00]  No, of course not.  We don't either.  It's all in humor.  It's an air conditioning unit.  And the white noise app is what it is.  It just goes.  Yeah, it just makes some noise.  Yeah, just a steady, just a steady noise.  Keeps away anything like tinnitus or, uh, or, uh, just thinking too much.  I need the opposite.  If I'm just laying in bed, staring at the ceiling, like there's all kinds of shit from, from like,  just basic, um, philosophy to chemistry and sometimes mechanical, uh, things. 
[02:39:30]  I'm constantly thinking of things.  No, it's not.  Here's what you're thinking of.  Here's what Anthony thinks of when he lies asleep.  Fucking faces creeping into his house and him with his night vision goggles shooting them at the foot of the steps  and making a dramatic statement.  Yeah, motherfucker.  And it's probably a really bad 80s thing that he yells at them.  Getting it on a camera mounted on the gun so you can get that first person shooter.  Get that look, right.  That first person.  Jackie Marshall in Memphis writes,  Gus Lipman appears to be a manager at Guardsmark in Memphis. 
[02:40:00]  I see that too, but I don't have any picture.  What's Guardsmark?  I don't know what that is.  What kind of company is that?  New Security.  It ain't no TV, motherfuckers!  That's right.  What's that?  Let's see.  Nerdist 1, Gus 0.  Yes.  Let's see what Guardsmark is, though.  It could be a fucking big place.  I'm Gus.  New Security Services, they make vehicle barriers.  Oh, well.  Was he into vehicle barriers?  I bet he designs them.  I bet he designs them. 
[02:40:30]  Now that I think about it, he always had this gate around him.  I guess he was going to turn that into something sooner or later.  I knew he'd make something of those barriers.  How many tournaments did you win?  Did you win the junior high championships?  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, just a couple.  I mean, certainly not nowhere near the number that I competed in.  But, you know, every day at school for me for years was chess before school, during lunch,  and after school.  It was in the math teacher's classroom, which also had this bank of Apple IIe computers. 
[02:41:00]  And so it was like it was basically the computer lab chess room.  Would it annoy you if somebody just called out your moves every time you made it?  Like, if you made a move, they went, ooh, E4, interesting.  That would be so obnoxious.  Yeah.  Sounds like a mashup between, like, Project Runway and some sort of chess competition show.  Well, if you clap your hand before you pick your piece up, that would really bug your opponent.  E4.  All right.  Yeah.  You know, that's what chess needs is some of those. 
[02:41:30]  Because who would have thought anyone would watch poker on television?  When they started showing poker, I'm like, who the fuck is going to watch that?  And then it's huge.  It became huge.  Because they have these characters and these, you know, like these amazing Filipino guys  with the sunglasses on and the weird hats and the, you know, like, so if chess players,  if chess had some of those personalities, and I'm sure they do, I mean, look at all the  guys who play in the park.  You know, like all those guys, a lot of them.  Yeah, yeah.  Money and for food.  They're insane, insane chess players.  Like, that's, there's a show in there somewhere. 
[02:42:00]  ESPN playing chess championships.  Oh, my God.  Have you ever played the guys in the park?  No, I haven't.  If anyone from ESPN is listening, just, I don't know anything about the rest of your  sports, but just give me 3 to 3.30 in the morning as a time slot.  I will make you a chess show.  And I fucking guarantee you, that's when, that's when people who would watch chess would  be up and would crush.  Cambridge had a whole bunch of guys that played.  Where was that?  Is that a park?  Yeah.  In Boston.  Yeah.  In Cambridge area.  Those guys are good, man.  You can pay the, you play the guy for what? 
[02:42:30]  Tim Buxer?  Yeah, I forgot exactly how it went.  But one guy was legendary, fucking never lost with glasses, I remember.  And would he play a few people at once?  Fuck yeah, he would.  And people would line up just to play the one fucking guy.  I wish I remembered his name.  It was like Lawrence Fishburne in Searching for Bobby Fischer.  Yeah.  That's crazy.  Yeah.  How many moves ahead did Bobby Fischer think?  Hard to say.  I mean, they said Alakon can see like 10 or 12 moves ahead, which is really a lot.  But if you do something that fucks up their move?  Then you guys adjust your 12 moves.  And they're playing other grandmasters. 
[02:43:00]  They're playing guys who aren't going to make a fucking terrible movie.  Yeah.  A terrible move, you know.  You're watching, you know, you're looking, it really is, it's this crazy log, this future  log that you have to keep in your head where you go, you know, if he moves this, I can do  this and then this will happen and this will happen and this will happen.  But if he does this and I can move this, this, this, this, this.  And then, you know, you're trying to, you know, edge his pieces into a certain, into  a certain position so you can, you know, ultimately get the queen or checkmate him or, you know, 
[02:43:30]  there's a lot of, you sacrifice pieces and it's, it's really crazy.  I'll stick to Xbox.  I like, you know how you like, what we just talked about the guys that do the quirky stuff.  I like when chess players, there's certain ways that they handle pieces.  When you watch, like, when you would watch Fisher, cause he had very light fingers and  he would, he would, he would, the way he would pick up his pieces and put them down very,  it was like a, it was like a fucking, a dance.  Yeah.  I know what you're talking about.  A very fluid motion and, or the way they'll pick up one with the other and capture it.  And there's such a fucking comfort.  Almost like they're flipping a pancake or something. 
[02:44:00]  It's such a comfort.  Watch Kasparov play.  He would just take it and flip and throw the piece into his hand.  It's this really weird, delicate thing they do with their fucking hands.  Apparently in 1981, there was chess on television.  Look at that.  What is that?  We got a, a great graphic.  One game per season.  A split cam.  Now this is, this is not, this was actually compelling television in 1981.  Yeah.  It's not saying much, but it was.  Nerds.  I've been wanting to play the New South Indian for a long time.  That's, uh, that's Jan Heindonner and Tony Miles of England. 
[02:44:30]  Yeah.  Jan, no Jan, there we go.  What a shitty chess board.  Yeah, those are the, those are the chess boards that they used to put up on the, like  they, they would have someone, you know, if there was a really important game and there,  this is before like crazy graphics, they would have just like a, a poster board and they  would move, someone would move the pieces so you could see, so you could see what was  happening on the board.  They still do that.  Can you pause that?  Do you ever, let me ask you in your mind, cause I don't know, like these guys can,  all the 64 squares, these guys can go, I know where E4 is. 
[02:45:00]  I don't know where E5, like, do you think in terms of where this, cause I was watching  this guy, uh, Vishy Anand, he's the champion now, talk about his game and he was talking  to the press and he had a big board and he was going through, see if I did this, the G4  takes D5 and D5 comes in.  He was saying it in numerical form, not, and not Bishop takes Knight, but D4 takes E5.  Do you see it like that?  Or do you see the pieces?  Well, it's funny, there are two, there are two types of notation cause you, when you're  playing tournament, when you're playing tournament chess, you have a pad and you, you know, so 
[02:45:30]  you can like go through the game afterwards if you want to see what, you know, where you  fucked up.  Uh, and so you can either, you can either do like a very, the very literal, literal notation,  which is E2, E4, you know, D65, whatever.  Or you can say like, um, Knight X, Rook 5.  Right.  Which, which places, which places all the pieces in relation to each other on the board.  But I don't think it's, I don't think it's any different than someone, like a musician  going, oh yeah, that's a, that's an E9, uh, flat, you know, flat, flat the fifth.  Like they can just, they can just hear it. 
[02:46:00]  See, I never think, uh, very, when the King's, uh, pawn moves out too, that's a, uh, 24, I  think, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  So, but I never think that, um, the response would be E5, 25.  I never think in those terms, and I'm saying, do good players think of, in those terms?  I think a lot of them, I mean, like a lot of the really hardcore ones probably do, because  they're just over a board so much that it's just, like, they see it.  I gotta ask, though, so you spent a lot of your youth doing this chess thing, hours and 
[02:46:30]  hours a day, right, Chris?  Yes.  What made you go, fuck this and move on?  Because you, you said earlier in the interview.  I wanted to touch a boob.  Was it, I was gonna ask, did you, did you discover girls?  Because that ruins a lot of our hobbies.  What happened was, um, uh, my mom remarried, and we moved away from the school that I had  been in, so I, I sort of lost the chess club thing, and then I, you know, I started in a  new town, uh, at a new school, uh, that didn't really have much of a chess club, and, like, 
[02:47:00]  that was around the time when I was, you know, just sort of getting into teenhood, and sort  of like, oh, I was trying, it was like I wanted to start over in this new place, because I had  been so mercilessly, uh, uh, chastised in the, in the sort of nerd bubble that I was  in, so I was, that's when I tried to, like, oh, I want to try to...  I always find it fascinating, because it was everything to you, and then one day you just  fucking walked away from it.  Yeah, I play, I would play, I would play kind of, you know, secretly, but not out, you  know, not out in the open at school, because I just didn't want to, I thought it was a 
[02:47:30]  chance to start over, you know, because it, again, it was not a cool thing, like, the nerd  thing was not cool in the 80s at all, so, uh, there was no irony, there was no ironic  hipster nerds, there was no irony in the 80s, so...  Let's go to Andrew in D.C., we got Chris Hardwick, uh, in studio today, his new book, The Nerdist  Way, online feed is down, again?  Chris, I'm so bummed I'm going to miss you when you're in D.C. on Sunday, I so wanted to  see you, I'm a big...  We're rescheduling that show, so I'm actually not going to be there Sunday. 
[02:48:00]  Yeah, so we're rescheduling that show for early next year, because I have to, I do a show  called Talking Dead, which is a Walking Dead after show, and we have to do that show on  Sunday now, so...  Clearly, I'm not enough of a nerd to have caught up with that.  Can you explain to the guys, first of all, your burrito philosophy, and then also, you  need to talk about the rest of, sort of, the nerdist.com, because guys, there's this woman,  Sex Nerd Sandra, who does this great show, I mean, it's really amazing stuff, so, you know, 
[02:48:30]  please tell them, talk to them about the burrito philosophy.  Okay, so, we say this thing at the end of every podcast episode, we say, enjoy your  burrito, and it's something that one of my co-hosts, Jonah Ray, came up with years ago  when he first moved to L.A., he was living out in San Pedro, and he had no money, and  his life was shitty, and he hated it, and there was this one burrito shack, and every day, that's  all he could afford, he would go get this one burrito that he loved, and it was the only  good thing about his day, and he'd get halfway through, and he would, he'd get depressed, 
[02:49:00]  because he knew the burrito was about to be over, and then his day was going to be shit  again, and he said one day, he finally had to convince himself to just enjoy the burrito  while he was eating it, and so that sort of became this metaphor on the show for, like,  enjoy the present.  Don't live in the past, don't live in the future, enjoy the present.  So we say enjoy your burrito at the end of every episode.  How about you cut the fucking burrito in half, and had fun later?  Yeah, save it for later.  Split up your fun.  Eat the burrito while you're getting blown, making it an amazing day. 
[02:49:30]  That is thinking outside the bun, Jim.  And then Sex Nerd Sandra, as we do another, we do a, there's a sex educator that I'm friends  with, and so I gave her a podcast, and she's great.  Her name's Sandra Doherty, and she, you know, she does a podcast on the Nerdist Podcast Network.  You know what's the cool thing about that channel is, about, at least about G4, is  Attack of the Shit, it's such a fucking, it's really funny, but it's, like, laid back.  It almost seems like the network isn't on them to, because the content they got away  with, I did one episode, and I couldn't believe, I couldn't believe the fucking content 
[02:50:00]  that the host got away with on TV, and these, I was like, they're really letting these guys  be funny, which is great.  Yeah, they're really cool, like, it's, G4's a really cool place to work, because, you  know, it's, they're hungry, and, but they're, everyone's nice, and, you know, and they're  very cool, and they know who their audience is, and they don't want to, you know, they  don't want to get in the way of that.  Yeah, but he was doing some edgier stuff, which, it's like, it's nice to see, because  you get so depressed watching fucking guys be cute, and it's like, ugh.  Yeah, and also, you must do a million interviews, where you just, you mentally just check out, 
[02:50:30]  because you're like, ugh, God, these questions.  Yeah, so you're in Spider-Man!  Oh, really?  What the fuck?  And that's how I say it.  That was fascinating.  They don't even know.  They don't know, I had one line.  They think I'm going to have a great story about it, like, yeah, and then me and Toby  got drunk, and we were fucking Kirsten Dunst, and she fell into a lake, nothing.  The second unit shit is.  I did, I was, she was, I did foul last night, and Kirsten Dunst was on.  Oh, was she?  I didn't get to say hi.  I haven't met her either.  I didn't like her. 
[02:51:00]  I do, I think she's, I think she's adorable.  I liked her and liked Spider-Man.  Yeah.  She kind of got a little weird.  I watched that fucking weird movie with the planet that was going to hit the fucking...  Oh, Melancholia?  Holy shit.  I haven't seen it yet.  It's fucking crazy.  She just won Best Actress at Cannes for that movie.  For that?  Yeah.  Yeah, it's not a role that she normally would take, and she looks a little more mature in  it than we're used to seeing her.  All right, all right.  But what a weird, creepy movie that is.  Yeah, I think they said it was on iTunes, so I'll grab that. 
[02:51:30]  Oh, maybe that's it.  Yeah, Melancholia.  I watched it in the theater.  Oh, nice.  Yeah, yeah.  So you have time to go see movies?  I never go see movies in the theater anymore.  He doesn't either.  I don't either.  He's in the theater in his house.  What was the last thing you saw?  The last thing I saw in the theater?  Yeah.  Fuck.  Leather Boy Glory Holes.  Oh, that's a good one.  Not that theater.  No, I'm trying to think.  Was that one movie or a double feature?  I'm trying to think.  Fuck, I can't even remember.  I wanted to go see Paranormal 3 when I was in Pittsburgh, but I just didn't have time.  Fuck, dude. 
[02:52:00]  I can't remember.  I heard Paranormal 3 was really good.  I know.  It was scary.  I cannot remember the last thing I saw.  I saw The Innkeepers.  This weird thing happens when you get older and busy, and you're like, ah, movie.  I gotta go, you know, in L.A., it's like, I gotta go park, and then I gotta go wait,  and then I gotta get back in the car.  Oh, I don't have time to do that.  You talk yourself out of going places.  Totally talk yourself out of it.  It was April.  Last April, the premiere of Arthur.  It was the last movie I went to.  Oh, really?  I don't feel like there's a lot of good movies coming out lately, though, in general.  There's a couple.  I'm looking forward to The Avengers next year.  The Avengers?  Yes.  I think Avengers is gonna be fun, but that doesn't come out till. 
[02:52:30]  Well, I want to see Tower Heist.  Yeah, Tower Heist looks fun.  I love to see, I love it when Eddie Murphy, like, he's back to the old Eddie Murphy, so  that's exciting.  Didn't you think he should have been nominated for Bowfinger?  I didn't see Bowfinger.  Oh, my God.  He was so amazing in that movie.  Amazing.  Like, mind-blowingly.  I didn't see it.  He was, check it out, see it.  It's great.  Is it a comedy?  Yeah, Steve Martin.  Right.  And it's a cool story, and Eddie Murphy is just phenomenal in the movie.  Oh, okay.  Love that guy.  Love him. 
[02:53:00]  I always, if we had Brett Ratner, and we were talking about this movie, and I said to  him, and I've always wished Murphy would do something that was, like, completely anti-Eddie  Murphy, because, like, Pryor did, like, you know, Grease Lightning and Blue Collar, and  Murphy's a good actor.  Like, I would love to see him do something that was fucking, like, play, like, a really  unlikable guy.  It must be weird when you are one of the biggest stars in the world.  It is.  Because you think to yourself, people are always like, how do you, and then you walk away. 
[02:53:30]  But, I mean, he can do anything he wants.  So he could do, like, some, he could do some weird student film if he wanted to, just to  play a weird role.  But I guess if you're a superstar, you just kind of are like, well, I guess, you know,  it's a little bit easier just to stick to what you think are going to be the star roles,  I guess.  I don't know, what you're used to succeeding in, I think.  Maybe he just doesn't want to take the chance.  Yeah, maybe.  I don't know.  I don't know.  But I think he's amazing.  I would love to see him do more stuff where he plays around with... 
[02:54:00]  Different stuff, right?  Because he's a good actor.  He's a great actor.  Turns out this Tower Heist is doing okay, too.  Good.  Yeah.  I think the review's all right for this movie.  Someone was trying to link it on the Google News.  I saw someone was trying to link it to, you know, because Occupy Wall Street, the little  guy taking money from the big guy movies.  I'm like, are those people occupying Wall Street really going to be like, God, we got to go  see Tower Heist.  I got to get out of this tent and go see Tower Heist.  I don't know if that...  I don't think so.  I don't think they're doing that.  Have you been down there? 
[02:54:30]  No, I haven't been down there yet.  It's a wild place.  A bunch of douchebags.  It's pretty lees.  I have not been down there yet.  You should check it out while you're in New York.  I mean, in L.A., no one really goes downtown in L.A. unless you work downtown.  Yeah, there's no reason.  Is that where it is in L.A.?  What?  They have one in L.A.?  Yeah.  Okay.  But it's downtown.  It's downtown.  Yeah.  And L.A. is such a weird...  It's just not a city.  It's not a unified city.  It's a bunch of smaller hamlets connected by traffic.  Like, there's no real central... 
[02:55:00]  Yeah, it's very spread out.  But your city, it's like a ghost city.  When you do end up downtown L.A., you're like, where are the fuck...  In the buildings?  Yeah, where are the people?  Well, downtown L.A., it's just like, when it gets dark, they drop all the gates on the buildings.  Yeah, man, everyone just leaves.  They always try to rehabilitate it, but you don't...  So you have these really nice buildings, and then one street over, you have completely impoverished people  living in these weird tent cities, like Skid Row, these insane tent cities, that looks 
[02:55:30]  very third world.  Yeah, downtown L.A. is a strange fucking place.  Yeah, it's a very...  It's a strange dichotomy.  Absolutely.  What are you looking at there?  What do you got there?  Oh, you're looking at Rotten Tomatoes?  All these positive reviews are negative.  Oh, are they?  Then how are they classified as positive?  What do you mean?  Read a positive review that's negative.  That's negative.  For Tower Heist, right?  Negative.  You really want these poor slubs to get their very justified revenge, just like you want  to like this movie? 
[02:56:00]  Wait, wait, wait, read this first one.  Read this first one.  This is the perfect example of a guy who has too much time, who's trying to sound clever  on Rotten Tomatoes.  You really want these poor slubs to get their very justified revenge, just like you want  to like this movie.  It co-ops you from the very start.  So, mission accomplished.  Building references.  And that's a fucking...  That's a positive review.  Why do you have to do that?  No, no, I don't know.  That's crazy.  That is a positive review.  Oh, that is a positive review.  Yeah, maybe it's like you really want to like this movie. 
[02:56:30]  Maybe you do like the movie because you want to like it.  Sam, you're reading it like you want to like it, but you're failing.  Maybe they're saying you really want to like this movie, and you are.  Maybe.  Can you read another one, Sam?  There's a lot of them.  Especially the ones that have building references, please.  Well, I mean, Tower Heist is an improbably satisfying action comedy.  The kind of wax-on, wax-off, slickly machined Hollywood widget that meets its audience expectations  without once aspiring to exceed them.  But like, what is the whole thing? 
[02:57:00]  Look at the smarmyness of that.  Yeah, well, you should see.  She looks like a librarian.  She's got the glasses, slicked down hair.  You're trying so hard to sound clever.  What is that fucking slickly oiled widget?  Sorry, she writes for the Washington Post.  Does she fuck her?  You might neither.  Slickly oiled widget.  Yeah, I haven't seen anything.  Who says that?  What does that mean?  I don't know what a slickly oiled widget is.  I don't need to think that hard.  Stop.  Tell me if the movie's good.  Is it good or not?  Thank you.  Should I go see this?  Should I go see this? 
[02:57:30]  Stop with the wordplay.  I mean, Tower Heist isn't really a movie that you need to describe as a slickly oiled widget.  It's not like an Oscar-nominated show.  Is it funny?  Is it not funny?  Is it good?  Is it not good?  I love Ben Stiller.  I love Eddie Murphy.  Casey Affleck's great.  It's got a great cast.  It's got a great cast.  There you go.  One more, Sam.  The most that can be said for Tower Heist, the new action comedy from Brett Ratner, is  that it's middlingly well done evocation of the big budget caper you remember with a  vague fondness from long ago matinees at the mall. 
[02:58:00]  Jesus.  These are all...  I don't even know if that's positive or negative anymore.  No.  I think that's positive.  I don't have the words in that.  Just words.  That's from Slate.  They're cool.  I like Slate.  Slate's all right.  They're basically saying it's an average caper film.  Yeah.  That's how you sum that up.  I'll say that.  Average caper film.  I don't even know what else is out right now.  I just never have time to go see movies.  I don't know either, man.  Especially because, you know, when you tour, people think when you're a comic, you're like,  oh, you don't have anything to do during the day.  And it's like, no, well, you either sleep because you have to, you know, you do super 
[02:58:30]  early radio and then you do two, two, three shows a night.  And you're just too tired in the middle of the day to go up and do anything or you have  other work to do.  I'm terrible, dude.  Like, I'll go down.  I'm doing New Brunswick tonight and I'll go down and sleep after this in the hotel for  a little while.  I'll try to sleep.  I'll fucking, uh, what do you do?  You sleep for three or four hours.  You wake up, you eat.  It's horrible.  People are like, why don't you go see these places?  I'm like, dude, I'm fucking just trying to not collapse on stage.  I'm just trying to not pass out.  How many shows tonight?  Just two tonight.  Two shows.  But I, I, because I get up so early, it's like fucking, if I don't sleep, I'm on two 
[02:59:00]  hours sleep.  It's terrible.  Yeah.  You need, you need, you need a little bit of rest if you're going to talk for an hour  straight per show.  Hour and a half.  How long is your show?  Hour, hour and a half?  An hour.  Yeah.  Nice.  We've been touring the podcast, which has been really fun.  On stage you're doing it?  Yeah, we do.  We go, we go places and we all do stand up and then we do like our kind of round table podcast.  There's Jonah Ray and Matt Myra, the guys who are on the show.  That's fucking awesome.  It's really fun.  It's great.  It's really fun.  Good for you, man.  Do you switch it up or no, no, we, we never, we never, um, plan what we're going to talk 
[02:59:30]  about.  We just sort of sit, sit and talk and it's, it's just very conversational.  You should have guests.  What we do, uh, like when we're in a city that actually we can get people, uh, then we'll  actually, then, then we'll have, then we'll have people.  Yeah.  It is kind of hard to get guests if you're in the middle of a, yeah, when we went to Portland,  we just, we didn't have any guests.  And I know there's a lot of, there's a lot of video game companies there, but we just didn't  track anyone down.  Also, we don't want to get people used to the idea that we have to get a guest every time.  And they're like, oh, how come there's no guest? 
[03:00:00]  Yeah, that's true.  Why have I fucking paid for no guest?  Like people, people would, people would send me tweets and they're like, oh, before I come  to your show, I need to know who the guest is.  And I'm like, sorry, we're not enough for you.  They want a good guest.  You got a lot of followers there, sir.  There's a few.  Nerdist on Twitter.  Holy shit.  1.5 something million?  Yeah.  Yeah.  There's a, yeah.  There's a good follow on Twitter.  I'm kind of, I'm digging Google plus now too.  I don't know how to use it.  We were just talking about how there's no buzz on it, but I, well, it was, I like it. 
[03:00:30]  I like it.  It's just, it's a very simple, clean, it's a cleaner version of Facebook.  Whereas Facebook was a cleaner version of my, I mean, I don't want to say Facebook was  a version of my space.  It wasn't really, but it just, it was a cleaner interface and Google plus is a, is a cleaner  interface.  And it's also Google plus hasn't been overrun by people you went to high school with.  It's just all nerds.  So it's really cool.  You think it's going to survive?  I think so.  I mean, listen, if any, if any, if any company can get behind something that has a little  bit of traction, I feel like Google plus has more traction than like wave or buzz or 
[03:01:00]  or cut or any of the other experiments that they've tried.  So, I mean, I really, I really like, I really like the Google plus.  But what is it like?  I don't know.  I keep getting these things.  Someone has added you to their circle of friends.  I don't know what to do with that.  But it's like, just say, thank you.  A circle is just like, it's just like a mini network that you create within the thing.  So you can, you can create any kind of circle you want.  So you can kind of list on Twitter.  It's like lists.  It's like a list.  Which I love.  And so when you share stuff, you can pick which circles you're sharing it with.  And then you can do these hangouts and circles crossover and you interact with people. 
[03:01:30]  It's, it's really cool.  Do you have a lot of people on Google plus?  No, I haven't been on it that long.  I haven't been on it that long.  I mean, they only just released it within the last couple months, but.  It's just kind of sitting there, unfortunately.  It's not really growing yet.  It's just kind of sitting.  I like it.  I like it.  This is a call to the ONA audience.  Check out Google plus.  And I'm Chris Hardwick on Google plus.  I'm on there.  I've done a little bit, but.  See, look who's in my, I got the Will Wheaton and Veronica Belmont and Aisha Tyler and Merlin 
[03:02:00]  Mann and Phil Plait.  Look at all these circles.  Yeah.  You got a lot of circles.  I got some circles.  What else about the book, Chris?  The Nerdist Way, How to Reach the Next Level in Real Life.  Please buy it.  Oh, you mean what's in it?  Just, I mean, there's a, there's a mind section, a body section and a time section.  So the mind section is all about, you know, for nerds, how to get out of your own way,  how to get, how to get out of your, how to get your brain out of the way so you can just  do stuff, how to ignore your brain, which a lot of people don't realize you can do. 
[03:02:30]  Then there's a fitness section because I really feel like I rejected that for so long and  it, it really does help.  It really, especially as you get older, like getting into some kind of an exercise.  You don't have to do five days a week.  You know, one day a week would change your life if you don't exercise at all.  And then the last is time.  Like once you kind of work on your mind and your body, it's, you know, like the last thing  left is, you know, how do you fill your day?  And so it's just like, you know, how to manage time, how to, how to manage finances, how to 
[03:03:00]  manage credit, just all sorts of stuff like that.  Chris is trying to help people.  I am because I was such a fuck up and I just, if I, you know, if I can help people learn  from my mistakes because I don't have kids, then it will make me feel like those mistakes  were not a complete waste of time.  And I feel like there's a lot of similarly minded, you know, nerd, nerd, nerd people  out there.  So I think that's right though.  Once you, once you get that, uh, getting laid thing in there, boy, you sure drop everything.  That just becomes the focal point. 
[03:03:30]  And based on how obsessive you are with it, that's how long it, it completely rules your  life.  It's just vagina.  Just vagina.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, there, there's a point where vagina just wins over anything.  Truthfully though, family, friends, food, that's the top of the pyramid.  Yeah.  But you can only have sex so much and then you have to do something else.  But, but I understand that.  But like when you first discover sex, then it's the top of the pyramid.  Yeah, exactly.  That's it.  Everything else is a pale second place. 
[03:04:00]  Yes.  And then as you get older, I don't think you give it up voluntarily, uh, the just complete  obsession with it.  Uh, and Jimmy never has, but you, you realize you, you got to allot your time to things like  work and getting your car registered and shit like that, uh, instead of the constant hunt  for pussy.  But is there an argument to be made that you do all that stuff so that you can, you can  get pussy, right?  Yeah, exactly.  Now I must search further for pussy.  Yeah, exactly.  So I must register my car.  I'm established.  Traveling.  I'm established.  I'm responsible. 
[03:04:30]  I have a career.  I'm a provider.  I need a house so I can bring pussy to my house.  With the hobby thing you're absolutely right about.  Yeah.  Also in your beer can collections in the garage, in the basement, your baseball cards are in  the attic.  I had microscopes, telescopes, chemistry sets.  I had all that shit, man.  Cobwebs on that shit.  All of it.  And it fucking went.  Trying to build the perfect vagina.  Yes.  Yes, I built it.  I have tissue samples.  That shit went into boxes, right?  I built it.  It took one, yeah, the second I went into a box, all that shit did too.  Go up to the.  Go up into your parents' attic right now. 
[03:05:00]  You'll be reminded of the hobbies you used to do before you discovered pussy.  Oh, I remember that.  It's up there.  No, that's what happens, though.  But real nerds survive that, I think, and continue with their hobbies.  I had one Playboy magazine that survived years.  Years of abuse?  It was, you know, I got it in the mid-80s.  It was the one with Julie McCullough.  Do you remember her?  I remember the name.  I know Julian McCullough, the comedian.  Look it up there.  Not the same.  Yeah, Julian McCullough was my 80s Playmate fantasy. 
[03:05:30]  Oh.  Let's see.  IMDb.  Images.  How saucy.  That's her right there.  That's a lovely girl.  Is that her?  How lovely of her.  That's her now.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  I know who that is.  Wow.  Yeah, she's very hot.  What?  Growing Pains.  Growing Pains.  Right.  And I think she actually got fired off Growing Pains, because Kirk Cameron is hyper-Christian  and didn't like that she...  I remember this girl.  Yes, I remember that.  I remember that shot.  I had the same plane. 
[03:06:00]  Let me sing it, Sam.  Fucking A, yes.  Didn't she pop out of that cake?  What a great issue.  She popped out of that cake in...  Did she?  Well, help me out.  That movie with the...  Someone will get it.  Two Girls on Cup.  Yes!  Look up the IMDb.  It was the famous birthday cake scene.  Oh, boy.  I mean, she's only physically flawless there.  Wait a minute.  Holy shit, Amino.  Did Kirk Cameron have her fired?  I can't confirm that.  Technically, God did.  Fucking Dishpag.  I can't confirm that, but that was the story that I had heard. 
[03:06:30]  Well, he did now in Jim's head.  Enjoy your God.  We'll enjoy her...  Is there a trivia?  Come on, come on.  Come on, come on, come on, come on.  I mean, I feel like I could be 70 years old  and have sex with, like, 75-year-old Julie McCullough,  and I would still...  Still bring you right back?  Yeah, it would still bring me right back to the 80s.  Maybe it wasn't her.  To the 80s.  The blob.  Oh, that's right.  She was in the blob.  She was Susie in the blob.  She had guessed it on Max Headroom. 
[03:07:00]  Yes.  Wow, Max Headroom.  Jesus.  Maybe it wasn't her.  No?  Older girls.  What?  I don't know.  Like submarines or something.  Oh, without her consent.  That sounds like a good one.  No, no, no, no.  It's like to rent a car.  It's not a sexual thing.  It's like, oh, I rented this car with someone else's ID.  Oh, I always go there.  No.  I've seen somebody else.  Now I feel like an asshole.  What are you going to do?  What are you going to do?  It's right.  Under Siege.  Thank you, Robert.  Yeah, Under Siege.  That's her. 
[03:07:30]  It was a chick that popped out of a cake.  Was that her?  Is that a Steven Seagal movie?  Yes.  Yes, certainly is.  Was that the train one?  I don't know.  Or was it...  He was the cook.  No, it was the submarine...  Yeah, he's a sub.  He's a guy who flops everybody in the sub.  I'm just a cook.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm just a cook.  Was it her?  It was Erica Eleniak.  Yeah, but she sort of looks like it.  Erica Eleniak, too.  Yeah, she kind of looked like Julie, right?  Yeah, she was another one, yeah.  But she looked like her a little bit.  Definitely.  She popped out of the cake.  All right, at least we got the answer.  Definitely.  I had it wrong.  We have a signed copy of the... 
[03:08:00]  Oh, yeah.  Right.  Right.  No, that wasn't for me.  That was for them.  Well, you could say it, too.  We have a signed copy of the book to give away with Nerdsway.  Chris, I would say, Chris, you've done a lot of television stuff.  How do you compare that?  Well, I don't know.  I just do this and that.  I'm going to ask you a radio question.  Yes, of course.  You were on K-Rock.  Yeah, for three years.  So you did the radio thing and said, fuck radio, and you went on and became a big star  and a success, and now you're back to doing radio, technically, with the podcast.  Well, I always loved doing radio.  Right.  I loved doing radio.  What happened was, you know, I worked at K-Rock from 95 to 98, like, right as... 
[03:08:30]  It was a great time to work there, because K-Rock...  Who was there?  Kevin and Bean were there.  Jed the Fish was there.  Richard Blade was there.  Corolla was there.  Kimmel?  Kimmel had...  Kimmel was there, but he was just about to leave.  Yeah, Kimmel was on K-Rock in the 90s?  Yeah.  Oh, there he was.  Kimmel...  They had an amazing lineup of guys that went on to be very successful.  That's where Adam started.  Adam started because Kimmel was gonna do some sort of a boxing thing, and Corolla, who 
[03:09:00]  just happened to be an Acme Sketch comedy guy, but he was also a boxing trainer, like,  he kind of...  He hooked up with Jimmy, and Jimmy was like, God, you're really funny, and so he gave Corolla  the call-in line, and Corolla started calling in and doing characters, and that's where that  all happened.  He can box?  Yeah, he's...  Yeah.  I didn't know that.  His hands are all fucked up from, like, just from years of boxing.  I'm glad I always had nice interactions with him.  You don't want to take a jab from him, right?  Yeah.  What about Ralph, uh, Gorman? 
[03:09:30]  Ralph, uh...  Garmin.  Garmin.  Garmin.  Garmin was...  Garmin came in after I left, because he kind of replaced Jimmy.  What a fucking talent, man.  And so K-Rock was...  It was a great time to work there, because K-Rock was really kind of directing where alternative  music was going at that time.  It was like, grunge was at its peak, and it was, you know...  And then I left in 98, because I was doing the overnight shift and making $125 a shift,  and then I got offered a ton of money to go do a morning show at Y-107 in L.A., which  is now Super Estrella. 
[03:10:00]  Making money.  And, uh, you know, hablo espanol.  So, um, I, uh, I left, and I always missed radio, but the thing that, the thing that  I always really didn't like about radio was that it, I, there was, it had a ceiling, you  know?  Like, it only could get as big as the city that you were in, if you were lucky.  And that was the top, you know, 1%.  Sure.  So, I, I guess part of me just felt like, yeah, I like working in areas where I feel  like, you, it can grow as big as you want.  Mm-hmm. 
[03:10:30]  So, uh, so that's why, but I always...  Now with the podcast, that absolutely is happening.  Yeah, and, but, but I always miss just being able to talk to people in a, you know, in a  conversational way, which you're not really afforded the opportunity of in television.  Did you like the structure of radio?  I didn't like the, um, oh, we gotta go to break, oh, tighten it up, you know, throw  a music bed under this, do that, oh, we gotta hit this point, like, there was, there was  a lot of radio politics, and there was a lot of radio structure, and, you know, I feel  like there wasn't as much freedom as, as you get on a podcast where, and that's why I started,  because I can do whatever the fuck I want, and I don't have to answer to anybody. 
[03:11:00]  Yeah.  So, it's, but you guys have a sweet deal here, because you, you know, you reach a shitload  of people, and you have the, you, you have language freedom, and you don't have to stop  for breaks every 10 minutes.  And all that structure, uh, shit, we don't have to worry about it.  Yeah, yeah, you can do whatever you, we can do whatever you want, so.  Very cool, man.  I mean, what I'm doing is a version of what you guys are doing, and it's, and it's fun.  It's really fun.  What are you laughing at?  So, we're gonna give away, just people, yeah, comments.  Uh, you got book signings, Chris?  Because we're wrapping up, I think.  I'm gonna be in, I'm gonna be doing a book signing in Portland on the 9th at Powell's, 
[03:11:30]  uh, and so I'm doing a book signing there.  I'm actually gonna be popping around SiriusXM all day, and then, uh, and then I'll be on  Conan next week.  And then Talking Dead is a show I do that follows The Walking Dead on AMC.  Love Walking Dead.  Yeah, it's fucking great.  You're on AMC and the G4?  Yeah.  You get a lot of fucking gigs.  What is, uh, what is Talking Dead, though?  See, I missed that part, because I DVR it.  Talking Dead is a, uh, we, it's, it's, it's a Walking Dead post-show where I have, like,  people from the show and comedians on, like, Pussain's done it, and Patton, and Robert Kirkman, 
[03:12:00]  who created Walking Dead, and, uh, and we basically just, it's like a, kind of a therapy session,  because Walking Dead is so fucking dense with murderous zombie drama.  Yeah.  He's describing Sam's Hour that he's about to do.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Sam does, like, the post-show, and it's like a therapy session for everybody.  Yeah, it is, and so it's a little bit, it's, you know, like, we, it's a little bit lighter,  and we have fun and sort of break it down, and, you know, it's like water cooler talk,  and it's, it's really fun.  It airs after the encore presentation of Walking Dead on Sunday nights.  Wouldn't you be, wouldn't you be a little, uh, concerned if, if, uh, all that zombie blood  was getting on you?  Like, for any kind of open little cut. 
[03:12:30]  Oh, fuck yeah, yeah.  There's zombie blood everywhere, they're just swinging, like, like, sharp objects, like,  come on.  Yeah.  Yeah, you don't, you don't want to get zombie blood in your eyes or mouth.  I don't want zombie blood on me at all.  No.  Like, like, look, you get a little, you scratched yourself, maybe.  And now it's scabbed up a little bit.  Now you get zombie blood on you, it's no different than being nicked by the, the zombie.  Also, don't fuck a zombie without a condom.  Don't.  I would assume, don't fuck a zombie without a condom.  That could be trouble.  I just want to know if anybody else is uncomfortable that Anthony is auditioning right now for,  to be on the show.  Oh, no, I swear. 
[03:13:00]  I didn't get that sense.  Oh, boy.  Only Jimmy would think of that.  Oh, boy.  Because I was thinking what to say.  You would think of that.  It's like, oh, no, I, I actually wasn't, but if, you know, you ever.  That knows everything about the show and zombies.  If you need someone in a pinch, you know, I'm available.  And loves the show.  Did you read the comics?  Uh, illustrated novels.  Say yes.  What's wrong with that?  Say yes.  Say yes.  Of course I did.  You had the great point about zombie cuts.  Fucking.  They're so good.  The comics are so good, too. 
[03:13:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's awesome.  I couldn't even think.  I couldn't even think.  Oh, my God.  No, I have, I do.  I have one here.  Yeah.  I have, I have.  I was talking to Jim.  Yeah.  I have what we call.  Oh, my God.  Let's get out of here.  No.  That's hilarious.  I don't mind answering it.  It's fucking, I have, I have, it's become a running gag on the show. 
[03:14:00]  Uh-huh.  One is a good boy's phone.  Okay.  And one is a naughty boy's phone.  Okay, gotcha.  That's a good boy's phone.  And that is my naughty boy's phone.  Question answer.  There you go.  I didn't care.  We can explain in song for you as we end the show.  I don't want to sing.  Well, no, we got one of the, some celebrity even.  Yeah, we got celebrities that explain that very, uh, question there, Chris Hardwick.  All right, great.  We'll, we'll leave with the song, but it's always a pleasure when, uh, Nerdist comes by.  Thank you for letting me promote my book and just hang out.  And you guys are, I always love coming on your show.  Fuck yeah, man.  Come back sooner than later.  All right.  The book is called The Nerdist Way. 
[03:14:30]  Pick it up now.  Amazon and, uh, where else?  Just download it.  Uh, iTunes, uh, Amazon, Kindle, yeah.  No, I'm serious.  A bookstore.  You could walk into a bookstore and get one.  A real bookstore.  I don't know how to promote books anymore.  Yeah, it's a, it's a weird thing.  There's eBooks.  There's an audio version of it.  There's physical books.  I used to, I love physical books.  I loved my Barnes and Noble, my neighborhood.  And now that's a fucking Century 21.  I love physical books.  My bookstore went away.  I love physical books, but I also travel a lot.  So it's difficult to, you know, carry like a lot of books around. 
[03:15:00]  So I just, you know, I read a lot on Google devices.  You should see me on the plane with my encyclopedias.  I look like such a bull of all of them.  Let's see.  Should we do, uh, sharks to, uh, circus today or, or should we?  Oh, Jimmy.  Tonight.  Tickets.  Tomorrow.  Stress Factory.  Yes.  January 14th.  Tickets.  This will be sold out before the end of the day, uh, at the Borgata for January 14th.  It's myself, Artie Lang, uh, Dave Attell and Doug Stanhope at the event center. 
[03:15:30]  And, uh, you can go to the Borgata.com and, uh, we will be sold out before today is finished  easily.  So come see us.  All right.  Um, I guess that's it.  We'll, uh, we'll see you guys Monday.  See you back there.  You got your good boy phone and your naughty boy phone.  Your naughty boy phone and your good boy phone.  Your naughty boy phone and your good boy phone.  And your naughty boy phone and your good boy phone.
