<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts satirizing descriptions of their own program, followed by a darkly humorous story about a listener who named his horses after them and then neglected them.  This segued into a discussion of a male nurse convicted of murdering elderly patients, with the hosts expressing cynicism about the profession.  The political landscape then took center stage, as they covered the 2008 Democratic primaries, focusing on Hillary Clinton's wins in Ohio and Rhode Island, Obama's victory in Vermont (which they found surprising), and John McCain's Republican nomination.  Their commentary included skepticism towards Obama's electability and comparisons to JFK, alongside observations on McCain's appearance.  A debate on American exceptionalism ensued, fueled by their limited international experience and their assessment of the presidential candidates, touching on perceived appeals to racial anxieties among white Americans.  Short clips of Clinton and Obama's victory speeches were played.

A substantial portion of the show was dedicated to Mastic, Long Island, following a local DJ's apology for mocking its residents. Opie and Anthony announced their intention to extensively cover Mastic, presenting numerous news stories and listener calls featuring darkly humorous anecdotes and exaggerated stereotypes about the town.  This included tales of a teen faking sexual assault to avoid an exam, a public urination incident, and the high number of registered sex offenders.  They even expressed interest in buying a cheap house there.  Anthony shared a humorous anecdote about his father’s disapproval of his scientific interests, suggesting it steered him away from a potential career as a scientist or astronaut.  The hosts promoted their upcoming animation festival, a listener contest for Opie and Anthony-themed dioramas (using materials like macaroni and spray paint), and reviewed their "News Tease Hall of Fame."  Jim Norton's upcoming stand-up show in Atlanta was also promoted.

The next segment began with complaints about the non-payment of a show writer, Steven S., described as extremely impoverished.  This transitioned into criticism of their radio station's management, specifically the lack of a Program Director and general disorganization.  "Mastic moments" – humorous listener calls about Mastic – followed, including stories about outhouses and a bowling alley incident.  The death of Gary Gygax, creator of Dungeons & Dragons, was announced, sparking a lengthy discussion about the game and listener experiences.  The hosts then announced upcoming guests Andre Royo and Tristan Wilds from *The Wire*, which led to a prolonged discussion about the show, praising it over *The Sopranos*, focusing on the character Omar, and criticizing a particular lawyer.  They also noted some actors' British accents despite their American roles. The segment concluded with discussion of a typing software program containing a racial slur and a humorous segment creating outlandish promotional material for Anthony Cumia's fictional schemes, including a sorority called "Eat a Lot of Pie."

A further segment opened with another humorous anecdote about a software program (from Cosme Corporation) containing a racial slur (the N-word) repeated 50 times, discovered by a user named Monica. They discussed the user's reaction and the company’s apology.  Military acronyms, specifically "snafu," were discussed.  After mentioning the upcoming *The Wire* segment, they discussed John Ritter's death and the ensuing $14 million settlement, including a pending lawsuit against two doctors. A portion of Ritter’s final voicemail was played.  Tristan Wilds (Michael from *The Wire*) was the first guest, discussing his audition, character arc, and intense scenes, including a beatdown scene and Omar Little's death.  Andre Royo (Bubbles) joined later, his delayed arrival sparking humorous speculation.  He discussed his experiences on the show, his character's evolution, the lack of Emmy recognition, and anecdotes, including one involving a drug user mistaking him for his character and another about a meeting with Samuel L. Jackson on the set of *Shaft*.  The conversation included discussions of typecasting, the show's realism, portraying drug addiction, and other projects.  The interview concluded with promotion of *The Wire*'s finale and a music compilation.  The segment ended with the hosts discussing their careers.

The next segment featured both *The Wire* actors. The conversation began with discussion of one actor’s iconic red hat, auctioned for charity, and the show's realism, including anecdotes about the real-life Bubbles and filming in Baltimore, where they encountered real-life drug dealers and even gunshots during filming.  One actor recounted a story from J.D. Williams about a scene where real-life gunshots overlapped with filming.  Tristan Wilds discussed his relationship with Jay-Z, his acting career, and age, punctuated by suggestive and crude jokes from the hosts.  The conversation shifted to the show’s depiction of violence and its impact, mentioning specific scenes and character deaths, and comparing it to *The Sopranos*. David Simon's decision to end the series after five seasons was also discussed.  The latter half featured Opie's box of old audio cartridges, prompting reminiscing about their past radio shows, including a story about Howard Stern.  Opie played several audio carts, including a "Burt Ward Robin" advertisement, an Anthony Charlton Heston traffic report, a "Condom Man" jingle, a "Cry Baby" bit, a "Darth Vulgar" Star Wars parody, an "Opie" themed bit, and Bob Kelly's old stand-up.  The segment concluded with further discussion of the old carts and upcoming show plans.


The final segment focused on playing old audio tapes, particularly a very bad bit featuring Bobby Kelly.  Scheduling conflicts were discussed, delaying the Kelly tapes until Monday or Tuesday.  Repeated references to and imitations of the nonsensical phrase "yimmy" from a video game were present.  Other old bits, including "Condom Man," "Married Man," and "Stoner Spelling Bee," were played.  The breaking news of Patrick Swayze's pancreatic cancer and his reportedly short life expectancy led to discussions about his career and health, and speculation on his prognosis.  Studio guest Bobby Kelly appeared, and excerpts of his crude and offensive stand-up routines were played, featuring references to Saugus, Massachusetts, and repetitive catchphrases.  Conversations frequently digressed to Kelly's appearance, the hosts' past, and their comedic bits. A call from Jay Mohr further interrupted, adding discussion about Swayze and a brief Colin Quinn impression.  The show concluded with "Time of My Life" from *Dirty Dancing* as the "line of the day."


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  In the world of Radio Shock Jocs, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their office.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why? Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good?  Go screw!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Jocs, Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocs, Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocs, Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Jocs, Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocs, Opie and Anthony.  There was some dude who liked horses and liked the radio show and named his horses after us.  And then let him starve.  And then let him starve.  Great.  I like what we're doing to the listeners.  Starving them of entertainment.  They are sick.  Freeze.  Bobby, please love.  There's one part we want you to see.  That's easy. 
[00:01:00]  Oh, you okay?  Where entertainment is going?  These guys are watching porn.  Oh, Jesus.  What are we talking about?  We're done.  We're out.  What the hell?  It's time for people to understand these are words.  If you don't like them, turn the dial.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Good morning to all male nurses. 
[00:01:30]  Ooh.  Good morning to all male nurses.  That's good.  I forgot that we used to occasionally come on and say good morning to some just people out there that have certain jobs, doing things.  Yeah.  Male nurses today.  Male nurses today.  Also, I want to say good morning to all Dungeon and Dragon players.  Oh.  Good morning to all the Dungeon and Dragon players. 
[00:02:00]  We'll explain that one a little later on this morning.  But a big, how you doing to the male nurses of America.  Wake up.  It's time to kill people.  Wakey, wakey.  How many are waking up right now thinking, yeah, I'm going to kill someone today.  Right.  I'm going to suffocate some old bag.  What is their morning routine, do you think?  They have to polish their white shoes nice. 
[00:02:30]  Yeah.  They're all nice.  They've got to fluff up a pillow.  The death pillow.  The pillow of death.  Yeah.  Fluff it up.  Make sure it's all nice so it could push down on that old face and bend the nose.  They have to figure out how to kind of bend the nose back again once you're done suffocating them.  Oh, my God.  Because that's a dead giveaway.  Yeah.  That's a dead giveaway.  That bent over nose.  Like, I wonder what happened here.  Hey, what happened? 
[00:03:00]  Oh.  Do we have a male nurse in the news today?  Is that what's going on?  Yeah.  I like that little story.  Little male nurse story.  They're never good.  It's never like male nurse wins an award for helping people.  You never hear, male nurse becomes a doctor.  Finally.  No, it's just evil nurse.  Jailed, of course, for killing patients.  Ooh.  Yeah. 
[00:03:30]  Hospital nurse jailed Tuesday.  Recommendation he's not released for at least 30 years for murdering four frail and elderly patients  and trying to kill a fifth.  Colin Norris, branded evil by the judge, gave all five women overdoses of a diabetes drug,  insulin, from liberty.  And apparently this guy, the judge said, was essentially lazy. 
[00:04:00]  Seeing elderly patients as needing too much care.  So he killed them.  So he decides to play God.  Yeah.  That's just wonderful.  It's amazing how many male nurses make the news.  It's just unbelievable.  Yeah.  Is there one good male nurse out there?  Yeah, this one.  Practically speaking, it made sense.  The 32-year-old male nurse said he didn't like caring for geriatric patients. 
[00:04:30]  And detectives discovered striking similarities between the deaths that happened when he was on duty.  That always happens.  Why can't you just, like, go get another job?  Yeah.  Of course.  You know?  I don't like serving Starbucks coffee, so I'm going to start strangling the customers.  I mean, why don't you just, like, get your resume updated and find another job?  Only in that profession, you don't like your job, you start killing the elderly.  Yeah.  He's a sly one, though.  Yeah? 
[00:05:00]  Could have gotten off the hook here during police questioning.  He denied any involvement and tried to explain away the deaths as coincidence,  telling officers he'd, quote, been unlucky over the past 12 months.  Oops.  Another one dies.  Oops.  Oops.  Oops.  Oops.  And they're all dead the same way.  Like, at least, you know, mix it up a little bit.  Yeah.  Mix up things.  He killed them with the lethal doses of diabetes medication.  Did you say diabetes? 
[00:05:30]  Diabetes.  Diabetes.  Diabetes.  Diabetes.  Diabetes.  Diabetes.  Diabetes.  Diabetes.  Diabetes.  Diabetes.  Testing supplies.  Wilford Brimley.  Testing surprise.  Supplies.  So, we say good morning to all the male nurses.  Phone number 877-212-ONA.  More importantly.  Yes.  We say good morning.  Yes.  To the Hillary supporters out there.  Oh, boy.  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 2,000.  East Wisconsin.  Ohio.  Texas. 
[00:06:00]  And on to Penn State.  She's going to do it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hillary Clinton.  Nothing's going to turn her back now.  Oh, boy.  You're getting on the track now.  Okay.  Terrific.  We're trying to make our dreams come true.  Hillary Clinton.  We're trying to make our dreams come true. 
[00:06:30]  We're trying to make our dreams come true.  The last time I saw a mouth like that, I had a hook in it.  We're trying to make our dreams come true.  Is that supposed to be sexy?  We're working for us all day, yes, all day, make all our dreams come true. 
[00:07:00]  Ah.  We're working for us all day, yes, all day, make all our dreams come true for me and you.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  Boo-boo!  Yeah, there you go.  Hillary with the big, what, comeback yesterday?  Oh, yeah.  Was she expected to win these states or what?  What's the deal?  No, it was too close to call at the time.  Well, Texas is still too close to call, I believe, right?  But Hillary won Ohio. 
[00:07:30]  Good morning, Cleveland.  Hillary won Rhode Island.  Good morning, Rhode Island.  We're on in Rhode Island.  Yes.  And Obama, this is where it just doesn't make sense, won Vermont.  Yeah.  One of the whitest states in America.  I don't know how that happened.  He is winning the whitest states in America.  Yeah.  He won Maine a few weeks back.  Mm-hmm.  Now he's got Vermont under his belt.  And you know what, my...  That's a racial stereotype, by the way.  What?  You're calling it Vermont? 
[00:08:00]  He's got Vermont under his belt?  Wow.  Florida's probably the record.  My support for Obama is kind of waning.  Uh-oh.  Yeah, I'm starting to think that maybe he's just a good public speaker.  Is that it?  I'm starting to think that.  Why?  He had all that momentum in the last week or two, week or two, let's say in the last month,  and he just can't, he can't just, he can't knock her out. 
[00:08:30]  Couldn't, yeah, deliver the knockout punch.  He needs that knockout punch, and I've been waiting for the knockout punch, and it's not  happening.  No.  And then you look at him on TV, and it's like, come on!  Be the next JFK!  Wow.  Don't forget, though, I say this for Hillary, she's a seasoned politician, and she's got  Clinton there.  I mean, they've been in the game a long time.  Right.  And he's new, and there's no way he should be running over her this way anyway.  And she's not easy, like, she raised the point that Bill, I think Clinton, Bill didn't  get the nomination until June. 
[00:09:00]  Until June, right.  Oof.  So it's, you know, she's a seasoned veteran, man.  But I'm just hoping for more from Obama, and I'm just, it seems like his whole campaign  is kind of stagnant right now.  Yeah, yeah.  Trust me, I hate Hillary, and I hate this McCain guy.  I mean, he officially won the nomination last night, I guess.  Yeah.  He's got enough delegates, and he's just got crazy eyes.  Frankenstein.  The guy doesn't focus.  Well, no.  I know he was tortured.  What?  What?  What did I miss? 
[00:09:30]  Crazy eyes.  Iraq's just laughing at you.  Oh, thank you, Iraq.  I appreciate it.  It's funny what I missed, and actually, it was just funny.  It was just funny.  I'm laughing.  Obviously, you missed your own funny line.  No, but he doesn't focus when he...  Yeah, that is probably because of repeated blows with the butt end of an AK-47.  That might...  I understand that.  That might make you a little googly-eyed.  I understand that.  And, you know, I'm not going to join the bandwagon that he's going to go crazy in the White 
[00:10:00]  House, because he would have went crazy by now, right?  You think?  Sure.  He's been around a really long time, and he hasn't had any real outbursts, have he?  I don't know.  Maybe he has.  Some people have mentioned he's got a very short temper.  Yeah.  And when he loses it, it gets very intense.  He sometimes gets violent.  Yeah.  And I don't know, though.  I think in the White House, he'll be under a lot more scrutiny.  So we might see...  I would love to see him just lose his mind at a press conference.  Don't you know what happened to me? 
[00:10:30]  That'd be awesome.  What continues to amaze me is that we are, what, the greatest country in the world.  Yeah, I think we're losing that ranking, but...  So we say, so we say, the people of America...  We like saying that.  ...where most of us have never seen another country, but we just make a lot of assumptions  that we have to be the greatest.  We have to be.  I love that one.  Come on.  Oh, I'm American all the way through here, but...  You know, it's the greatest country in the world.  And then you ask the guy, well, have you been anywhere else? 
[00:11:00]  No.  Well, I've been to Niagara Falls.  That's officially Canada.  To the Grand Canyon.  Wait a minute.  Once walked over the border to drink in Mexico.  It's the greatest country in the world.  Well, it's the greatest country in the world.  Yeah, you only hear Americans say that.  I think you...  I don't hear other people from other countries go, it is the greatest country in the world.  Really?  Is it?  Can you imagine if there's actually a better country out there, but we just don't know it?  It's like, well, it's just an amazing place to realize.  This place rules, and it's not the United States? 
[00:11:30]  Yeah, wow.  This is amazing.  Well, they don't have Major League Baseball, but still, this place rules.  So, there you go.  The race is a lot closer.  But I said a couple weeks ago, I'm just amazed.  The greatest country in the world, and this is our choices.  Yeah.  Hillary, Obama, and John McCain.  And John McCain.  That was the best we could do.  That's it.  Knowing that Bush was just a disaster for at least the last four years,  if not for the entire eight years he was in office. 
[00:12:00]  And this is the best they could come up with.  Yeah, we are at the point here where if McCain doesn't win,  we will have a black president or a woman president.  Which I don't mind, but I don't know.  But they're not impressing me.  See, that's where we're different.  I don't mind a female president or a black president.  I mean, it's history making.  Yeah.  That's what I'm saying.  I wasn't saying I mind it.  You mind.  Oh, my God, please.  You mind.  People, are you out of your minds?  You mind. 
[00:12:30]  You cater to the racists.  What?  You cater to the racism out there, and I cater to the...  You cater to the racism.  To the free-thinking.  Free-thinking.  Racism.  What?  Why?  It works for...  Trust me, it works for this radio show.  Yeah.  It's a nice dynamic.  Oh, I know people are like rah-rah-ing when you start...  That's right.  Start your rant.  I don't think it's as much catering to racism as it is catering to fear that white America  has.  Yeah.  All right.  Fair enough.  You want to hear some Hillary speech? 
[00:13:00]  I would love it.  Oh, Huckabee's out of the race officially, huh?  Yeah, he finally dropped out.  And he's supporting McCain.  Do we really need to play that?  Who cares if Huckabee supports McCain?  Stupid Huckabee.  Here's...  Dumb name.  Here's Hillary's victory speech.  It's quick.  All these clips are usually very quick.  For everyone who has stumbled but stood right back up, and for everyone who works hard  and never gives up, this one is for you. 
[00:13:30]  All right, this one is...  Yeah.  This one is for you.  So what do we get?  Nothing.  You just get her saying this one's for you.  This one's for you.  I would be waiting outside going, all right, you said this one's for me.  What's for me?  What do I get?  You got the victory.  Right.  What do I get?  What do I get?  This one's for you.  You get me.  You know what they say.  Who?  As Ohio goes, so goes the nation. 
[00:14:00]  Really?  Who says that?  I think...  Ohio residents.  Yeah.  Right.  Well, I do think that whoever wins Ohio has, in the past, won the presidency.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Every single time?  I think every single time.  Maybe not in the days of the wigs.  What's wrong with the wigs?  I don't know.  The wigs party.  I love the wigs.  No.  Well, got something close this time.  All right.  What?  I didn't say anything. 
[00:14:30]  Well, this nation's coming back, and so is this campaign.  Rockstar.  Does she have someone listening to our radio show?  What happened to the...  She still does it.  Not there, man.  Not there, though.  She was smooth.  She's got a few different ways of speaking now.  Right.  That was the energetic Hillary.  Right.  Then she's got the crying Hillary.  Right.  And then she's got the...  No, she was pretty calm there.  Yeah.  Now, she's just kind of energetic a little bit. 
[00:15:00]  Not crying, though.  All right.  And now this is what we're going to do.  We got Obama.  Okay?  I'm going to listen very closely here and see if he's actually saying something.  Oh, you just think he's a nice voice, but nothing's coming out of his mouth.  Yeah.  I'm very suspicious all of a sudden.  Let's keep going to listen.  Man, I was...  Like Robin Williams' comedy, you mean?  Yeah.  Like people just feel compelled to laugh when he talks, and then you pick it apart and realize  he said nothing?  Yeah.  You're like, wait a minute.  That's not funny at all.  Look, it's a light bulb.  He just picked up a light bulb.  Okay.  Look, I have an idea. 
[00:15:30]  And then people are cracking up, and then you realize...  It's really not funny.  Yeah.  Not funny at all.  I was bamboozled by this Obama, so I'm going to have an open mind here.  I'm going to actually listen to see if he's saying anything.  All right.  Let's give a listen.  I want to congratulate Senator Clinton for running a hard-fought race in both Ohio and  Rhode Island.  We also know that we've won the state of Vermont, and so we want to say thank you to the people 
[00:16:00]  of Vermont.  What the hell?  Thanks.  How do you win Vermont?  I win Vermont.  Have you ever been up to Vermont?  Yeah.  How do you win Vermont?  I don't know.  That's live free or die, right?  Yeah.  No?  Oh, yeah.  That's New Hampshire.  I get those two mixed up.  They look the same, only upside down.  One's upside down version of the other one.  Pretty much.  What's Vermont's motto, state motto?  We like to ski.  Vote for... 
[00:16:30]  Well, yeah.  I was working the ski joke for you.  Of course.  I don't know what their state...  The Green Mountain State.  The Green Mountain State?  Don't they have a motto, though?  Like, live free or die?  No, they just say it's the Green Mountain State.  The Green Mountain State.  Yeah, they were bored that day.  I guess so.  Yeah.  Because that's dull.  They were high on hemp when it was time to come up with something witty.  You think there's dirty hippies up there?  Of course there are.  Like, I don't know much about Vermont's populace. 
[00:17:00]  Freedom and unity?  Freedom and unity?  Yuck.  That's not a good one.  To the people of Vermont.  And we know this.  No matter what happens tonight, we have nearly the same delegate lead as we did this morning.  And we are on our way to winning this nomination.  All right.  He said nothing.  He said nothing.  Yeah, he just kind of was congratulatory. 
[00:17:30]  And then you got McCain here really fast.  And pleased to note that tonight, my friends, we need some kind of music every time he talks.  Scary Frankenstein music.  You see this Photoshop?  Here's Johnny.  Yeah.  Instead of Nicholson coming through the door in the shining.  It's John McCain.  It says, here's Johnny.  That's a real crazy face from him.  Look at this guy.  And pleased to note that tonight, my friends, we have won enough delegates to claim with confidence, humility, and a great sense of responsibility that I will be the Republican nominee for President of the United States. 
[00:18:00]  Nice.  Thank you, Emperor Palpatine.  Is he frightening?  What choices?  Oh, my God.  Are we doomed?  I think we could agree with that, right?  Yeah.  Agree on that one?  Yeah.  The choices just suck. 
[00:18:30]  I think the guys that are really, really qualified and could really do a good job just don't want to be president anymore.  No.  It's a bitch of a job.  I mean, come on.  They know it's just filled with so much BS and red tape that you just don't really get anything done.  And they'd rather go do something else with their brains.  Do you think people that run for president really want to be president to make these changes?  Or do you think they just want to be president because it's a great cake?  It's a hell of a job to have. 
[00:19:00]  I mean, you're under the microscope for at least four years of your life.  I think they used to go in there wanting to make a lot of changes.  Absolutely.  But somewhere along the line, probably right after the JFK assassination, they decided to control things a little better.  And now you just go in there and you obey the laws of the underground.  Of the Illuminati.  Yes, exactly.  Because they truly want America.  It's just a figurehead.  Let's say hi to this guy in New York.  He doesn't have a name.  This guy in New York. 
[00:19:30]  What's up?  Hey.  Hey.  Love you.  Love the show, man.  Yeah.  What's up?  What's going on, boys?  I think you were right before.  I think that America is the greatest country in the world.  But I also believe that the greatest town on Long Island is Mastic.  Oh, you guys.  You guys.  You guys didn't let us forget.  Yeah.  It's get to know Mastic for the rest of the week.  Right.  Yes.  I think we're getting some facts about Mastic together for the people out there.  Well, a jock got in trouble here on Long Island for making fun of Mastic. 
[00:20:00]  And he had to apologize.  For a very tame line.  Oh, my God.  Now he was implying that they all live in trailers.  Yeah.  So now we took the ball and we're really running with it.  Yeah.  And we're paying tribute to Mastic.  And we're really showing the people what Mastic's all about.  Yeah.  All right.  We've got to take our first break.  Phone number 877-212-0&A.  Speaking of politics, here's a little Anthony kind of going off.  Ooh.  Check it out.  Our time has come.  In a world gone mad, only one man sees the truth. 
[00:20:30]  The message he was giving is that, hey, black people, this is our time.  It sounded like it was get back time.  Where's my 40 acres and a mule time?  We are ready to take this country in a fundamentally new direction.  That's what's happening in America right now.  Change is what's happening in America.  He's holding back. 
[00:21:00]  He's holding back.  But I see through the veneer.  I see.  I did not travel around this state over the last year and see a white South Carolina.  Oh, boy.  I saw a black South Carolina.  O&A Pictures presents a Cumia Brothers film, No Country for White Men.  I am having a little trouble dealing with this.  You can be the new majority.  He frightens me.  The story of one man's struggle to deal with losing control of everything he knows. 
[00:21:30]  I did have a theory, since this is getting a little scary.  We are the hope of those boys who have so little, who have been told that they cannot  have what they dream, that they cannot be what they imagine.  Yes, they can.  If it turns out that a black man can become president in this country, I think all excuses  are off from the black man.  This election is about black versus white. 
[00:22:00]  A black man in the White House.  Holy Jesus, Palomino.  No Country for White Men.  This film is not yet rated.  Hey, good morning to everybody.  Let's not forget, it's Whip'em Out Wednesday.  We're going to come back strong with this Whip'em Out Wednesday as spring hits us here, right?  Right.  We've kind of been low-key with the whole Whip'em Out Wednesday thing in the last year  or so.  But it's time to bring that back strong.  I've seen a lot of stickers out there, though. 
[00:22:30]  Do we have WOW stickers that you could get on onaradio.com?  Well, I would hope so.  Do we?  E-Rock?  E to the rock?  He says yes.  But you're seeing a lot of stickers out there on Long Island?  Yeah, yep.  As I drive home, I see a lot.  Some people recognize me zipping past them in the Escalade.  And then they try to catch up to me to no avail.  I was making such illegal moves yesterday driving home.  There was apparently some police activity closed down a couple of lanes, two lanes of the expressway. 
[00:23:00]  Left one lane open for two exits, complete exits.  Wow.  So the expressway was backed up all the way well into Queens.  And I was making moves that just, I probably could have been citizen arrested by people.  I didn't even take a cop.  There was one into oncoming traffic.  And then into a left turn lane, from which point I went through the red light and made a right turn in front of all the people that were waiting to go. 
[00:23:30]  I just assume if they see me driving like that, they probably think I have to have some reason to do it.  Yeah, either that or, you know.  Your secret service.  Right.  I'm very busy.  I'm in a hurry.  I have to be places.  You're driving a rap star around.  Yeah, something like that.  Yeah, that's a good point. 
[00:24:00]  If you get a pretty nice car and make some crazy moves, a lot of people will just assume you're doing something legal.  Yeah, they assume that you're doing this and you have, you know, power.  Hey, I got Puff Daddy in the back.  I got to get him to a club out there in Long Island.  Yeah, that's what I'm doing.  I'm making moves.  And I'm making, not bad moves like where you cut someone off or try to fit in there.  You make such ridiculous moves that people have to go, oh my God.  You know, you roll down the window.  It's got to be doing something.  I got the chancellor from Uruguay in the back.  Yeah.  So I'm on a mission of diplomatic import. 
[00:24:30]  Got to get him to a function in Hicksville.  So let me go here.  I guess we had a building collapse in New York as well.  Well, not really New York.  No.  Way uptown.  Yeah, I guess technically it's part of New York.  That's what they say.  But yeah, I mean, if it was in Midtown, then we'd all be talking.  But it was way up there.  Yeah.  Way up there.  Buildings are starting to fall down.  Yeah.  Oopsie.  What happened with that? 
[00:25:00]  Anyone die?  No.  But the whole facade.  Yes, the facade.  Fell off the front of the building.  What does facade mean?  I don't know.  False front.  False front, really?  But it's actually the front of the building.  It's also called the facade.  Right.  No, it's not false.  It was the real front.  Yeah.  But they had had complaints over the past few months about this building.  It's been under renovation.  And the fire department's been called there for other collapses inside the building.  A lot of squatters in there.  Squatters.  They go in there and just figure they'd live there for a while.  What is a squatter? 
[00:25:30]  It's the homeless.  They just go in and decide, eh, I'm going to stay here a while.  I thought squatters were people that had maybe something brewing inside them.  Something brewing?  Something percolating in the lower intestine?  I knew I'd work in brewing to the radio show today.  Brewing.  Something steeping.  Yeah, when you've got something brewing, you're percolating, you go to one of these squat houses.  That's what I would assume.  A squat house.  And then you can squat in peace.  So where are we at? 
[00:26:00]  Are we going to buy this house in Mastic?  Speaking of squatting.  I would absolutely buy a $1,900 house, a $1,600 house in Mastic.  Yeah, our goal is to buy a house in Mastic because we found out they go for as low as $1,900.  Yeah.  And then we want it to be the place where locals could go and just squat because they got something brewing.  All it is is a toilet.  And our goal is to fill the entire house up with the remains of what's brewing in your gut. 
[00:26:30]  The word of the day, if you haven't figured it out, is brewing.  Brewing.  Something's brewing.  Something's a-brewing.  Let's say hi to Chris on Long Island.  Chris, what's up?  I think Chris...  Oh, and hey, how are you?  Good, buddy.  Good.  Long-time listener, first-time caller.  Anybody that lives out in Mastic is known as a mastoid.  A mastoid?  Why a mastoid?  A mastoid.  Why? 
[00:27:00]  I don't know.  That's just a name that they inherited.  I don't know.  But we need to know what that means.  He's trying to be funny.  That's got to be a joke.  Are you joking with us, sir?  I'm trying to...  No, I'm dead serious.  So are people in Hempstead called hemorrhoids?  Hemorrhoids.  And getting...  All right.  Well, I'm from hunting-oid.  Okay.  And Anthony's from East Islipoid. 
[00:27:30]  Well, I moved around a lot.  Well, now we've got two things going.  I consider myself from East North Port.  Hey, we've got two things going now.  This is what we do with this radio show.  Work in the word brewing when you can.  Yeah.  Like you've got something brewing.  And instead of calling from...  Well, whatever town or city you call from,  please, please use the formula OID today.  Well, of course.  Okay.  Try to fit that in.  Hey, what's up with this mastic?  So the houses, we saw a couple that are for sale  for under $2,000.  Yeah.  We really do want to buy one of these houses. 
[00:28:00]  It all started with this dopey DJ out there in Long Island.  He made a white trash slash trailer joke.  Yep.  This person was outraged because she doesn't live in a trailer.  And it caused a big to-do.  The DJ got suspended.  In Mastic.  Because John Shea, the station manager,  wouldn't stick up for the guy, which is so lame.  And residents of Mastic and some of their town officials  were very angry.  Right.  And called for this guy's firing.  Correctamundo. 
[00:28:30]  So he had to issue an apology to the town of Mastic.  He had to do a book report.  Yeah, he had to do a book report on the whole thing.  Imagine your boss coming in and going,  I want you to do a, what in essence is a book report on a town,  and then issue an apology to the town based on what you've learned  and how sorry you are that you called them trailer trash.  Aren't we in radio because we did very poorly with book reports?  Yes.  It's the only reason we sit here with these microphones in front of us. 
[00:29:00]  It's because F.  F.  F.  F.  F.  F.  F.  F.  So the guy's back on the air, whatever.  He was suspended.  He had to read an apology that some lawyer drafted for the guy.  Yeah, jotted down for him that he didn't mean when he said it.  And the story pissed us off so much,  we decided to spend a whole week learning about Mastic.  Yeah, we're doing our research and we're commenting on it.  We're making an educated comment. 
[00:29:30]  We're making educated comments on Mastic.  And now it's time for a Mastic moment.  As Opie and Anthony take a glorious look at this majestic Long Island community.  And police say a Long Island high school student lied about being sexually assaulted  as a way to get out of an exam.  She claimed a man attacked her while she was walking to William Floyd High School in Mastic.  But when cops questioned her about inconsistencies in her story, 
[00:30:00]  the 17-year-old admitted she made up the attack because she hadn't prepared for the test.  The girl was not charged.  And that was a bird's eye view into the scenic town we hold close to our hearts.  A Mastic moment on the Opie and Anthony show.  Nice.  We learned about the Mastic liar today.  Yes, teen liars in Mastic.  See, I went to Harborfields High School and you wouldn't get away with that. 
[00:30:30]  Saying you were sexually harassed or assaulted on the way to Harborfields High School.  No, they'd be like, what?  Doesn't happen.  But I guess it happened so much in Mastic that that is a...  It's a viable excuse.  It's a viable excuse.  You could either use, teach my dog ate my homework,  or teach I got diddled on the way to school today.  Yeah, apparently a lot of sexual predators we found live in Mastic.  Right.  And I guess it's a good excuse if you're somebody and you're not prepared for a test 
[00:31:00]  to say that you were sexually assaulted on your way to school.  Right.  Amazing.  Let's say hi to Marty on Long Island.  Marty!  Hey, what's up, guy?  Hey.  Long time listening.  Right on.  I heard that before they asked him to do the book report  that he actually had to do a shoebox diorama of Mastic.  Wow, you are lingering a little longer.  You know, I didn't even know...  You're longer!  Thank you, Marty.  I didn't even know what a diorama was until you just explained it.  Yeah.  I knew it was a shoebox thing because we all had to make them in school, 
[00:31:30]  but I didn't realize it was called a diorama.  Is it a diorama?  I would assume it sounds like it would be.  Yeah, you'd make like a little scene in a shoebox.  Yeah.  And then you'd cut the, like, part of the top off.  Yeah.  And cover it with wax paper.  Yeah.  Wax paper.  And then you'd cut a hole in the front, and you'd pick it up,  and you'd put the open end of the shoebox that you opened  and covered with wax paper under a light.  And then you'd look through the little hole,  and you'd see the little scene that you made inside 
[00:32:00]  with little army men and a little mirror for a lake.  You know the kids that did real well making dioramas?  You know what they're doing today?  What?  Working in museums.  Or doing radio.  I was very good at the diorama.  Were you really?  Oh, yeah.  Yuck.  I used to impress all the girls with my diorama.  You know, a little known fact about Anthony.  I have some diorama.  Could I get some Pepto-Bismol?  You were a goody two-shoes growing up.  It's pretty obvious.  Oh, I was.  You talk about looking in your microscopes as a kid. 
[00:32:30]  Microscopes, telescopes, chemistry sets.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I was a little fairy, is what you would call them today.  I was a little fairy Mary.  Your dad ruined you, man, because you had the makings of being a brilliant scientist, and  he thought you had the makings of being a fag.  That was pretty much what a dear old dad kind of, he thought I was going to be a wussy.  If he would have let you be, you probably would have done great things. 
[00:33:00]  I may have been an astronaut.  Not that we're doing great things with this unbelievable radio show.  On a daily basis, I look back with pride at what I did that day.  I'm so proud.  People look at a guy like Einstein, whatever, and they wonder, what would happen if he hadn't  had this nurturing as a child?  Let's just say alcoholism had been involved.  Einstein would have been a comic genius on the radio.  Yeah, yeah.  Instead of discovering.  Exactly.  You discovered something.  Yeah.  I really do think there was a defined fork in the road of my life. 
[00:33:30]  Sure.  And I kind of took the, maybe a wrong turn.  It's funny because a lot of people wonder why we don't have flying cars, like the Jetsons.  The reason?  Because Anthony's dad thought he was a fag and had to get rid of all his scientific stuff.  Yeah, yeah.  Everything kind of, you know, come on.  Nah, big a man.  Hey.  You're in man training, he would tell me. 
[00:34:00]  Hey, I don't know if there's a bit here.  We're always thinking bits, okay?  It's a lot of this stuff, it falls by the wayside.  Yeah.  Which is brought up a lot by Ron and Fez, that we have a lot of things that never develop.  Oh, really?  Never go to the full stage.  Ends in that stage, that pupa stage, whatever the hell it's called.  Yes.  But then some of these things do take off, like our animation festival will happen.  You're saying we have a lot of bit abortions?  Yeah.  By the way, for the animation festival, we got an update on onaradio.com. 
[00:34:30]  Find the link, though.  Good luck to you.  Yeah.  It's under the Beacon Rewind banner.  And it's a tiny little thing that says ONA's Animation Festival or something like that.  Or ONA's Animation Contest.  We're doing a real animation contest now, not the lame one that the radio station did  for two weeks.  No.  This is one that's going to have real prize money.  We're getting a venue, and we're going to do it for at least two months, so we make  sure we get some great animations in.  Yeah.  So the update is up on onaradio.com.  But with that said, I'm wondering if maybe some of the listeners could develop some of 
[00:35:00]  these dioramas or whatever.  A diorama based on the show?  That could be pretty funny.  That would be, based on anything to do with the show.  So there's a picture of a diorama.  Yeah.  That one's done differently, though.  That one's up on its end.  Yeah.  I like the one you look through.  Yeah.  But I think the one up on the end is better for our purposes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Then you'll see it.  Then you can put these up on the website.  Uh-huh.  We really should do that, man.  We should have a dumb little contest. 
[00:35:30]  The best Opie and Anthony diorama.  Diorama.  Diorama.  We're giving you homework.  Right.  Basically, the show.  The show's giving you homework.  We're your cool teacher.  Yeah.  We're the teacher.  The teacher that takes you outside on a nice day to teach you outside under the tree.  And let you smoke pot behind the tree.  Yeah.  We'll work the other way.  No problem.  We won't hassle you.  No, no.  But it's all animations and dioramas.  Just things children would like.  I know.  Who can make the biggest gift in diapers in the shape of an Opie and Anthony member?  I know. 
[00:36:00]  I can't wait till we have the make something out of macaroni contest.  Spray painted gold.  God, what idiots.  We are retarded.  That's why they love us.  It's just child.  These are child assignments we give out.  If these people really knew how old we were, they would be just shocked.  It's horrid that we're giving out little projects that you give to children.  We stopped growing. 
[00:36:30]  I truly believe I stopped aging mentally at 26 years old.  And again, I always take issue with the, I don't like the fact that you've given yourself  at least 12 years.  I know.  It really is.  I honestly don't see a big change aside from where I am in life, things like that.  But in my mental state and what I'm thinking, 15, which is just horrible.  Well, I stayed at college until I was 24 because I was like, wow, this is really cool. 
[00:37:00]  I could live as a college kid for the rest of my life.  And then like the girls started looking at you and you just, you could tell they're looking  at you and going, what a creep.  Why is he still walking around campus and hanging out at the bars?  You don't want to be the old guy at the club.  At 24, I finally had to move on.  And then around 26, I'm like, yeah, this is the age I'll live for the next, I don't know,  30 years.  Lock it in.  Yeah, I'm locked in at 26.  Bobby Big Rager, what's up? 
[00:37:30]  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey, man.  I remember a while back there, I got a hold of some bad sushi.  Yeah.  And it was brewing.  I mean, really brewing.  Yeah.  And I wound up making my own diurema.  Diurema?  Diurema.  I like diurema.  Yeah, very good, Bobby.  It's a diurema of a mudslide.  California mountainside caving in.  All right.  You know, we might be on to something.  John in Cleveland.  John?  Yeah, I'm making the official opium Anthony popsicle stick wishing well. 
[00:38:00]  Wow, that'd be nice.  I'm diurema.  Get your...  And he's listening to himself.  He's going to get a big laugh there.  Of course he is.  Maybe we should do...  Maybe we should open the contest to just, like, kid projects in general.  Elementary school projects.  Like, maybe someone can make something opium Anthony related with just macaroni.  Macaroni.  On a piece of construction paper.  Yeah.  On a piece of oak tag. 
[00:38:30]  Right.  We are just the worst.  Children.  My God.  My God, man.  Let's say hi to Sean in Rockland.  Sean?  How's it going, guys?  Hey, I heard Mastic was the town that's sending all those sexual offenders from, from the news  tease.  Oh.  Is it your town?  From the famous news tease that we haven't played in a really long time.  Well, you know what?  We did look up that, that map.  What is it called?  The sexual predator map or whatever. 
[00:39:00]  Yeah.  Can you see how many sexual predators are in your, in your town?  And Mastic is, is quite impressive.  It looked like a Christmas tree.  All the colors were represented.  You got the, look, I'm looking at it again.  You got greens.  You got purples.  You got reds.  You got yellows.  Red's got to be the bad one.  Is red the bad one?  Oh, red's the bad one.  That's the guy that just can't control himself.  He just runs around nude chasing school buses.  Candy and a hammer.  This is the, uh, the news tease that guy's referring to. 
[00:39:30]  One city wants to pack all their sex offenders into a three block area.  Problem is, it could be right next to your house.  If you live in Mastic.  Right.  Hey, what happened to our news teases?  We got the News Tease Hall of Fame and we haven't played any new ones in a while.  No inductees in quite a while.  Is Danny working on that still?  I'm sure.  You want to throw, you want to run through the Hall of Fame?  We haven't done it in a while.  I love it.  We have about five or six.  These are the news teases in the News Tease Hall of Fame.  The one we just played.  Then you got this one.  How a twist on the predator law could shut down religion. 
[00:40:00]  Yeah, of course.  I guess that didn't happen.  No.  It's also good to review these every so often because they are pretty old.  Yeah.  And see if anything really came of these stories.  Yeah.  Religion has not been shut down.  Religion not shut down.  No.  Could frequent hiccups be a sign of cancer?  Watch News 8 at 10.  I haven't really heard much more about that.  And if you're hiccuping during dialysis.  Yeah.  Right.  Wait, is that cancer?  Or chemo. 
[00:40:30]  Yeah, dialysis.  Could frequent hiccuping be a sign of kidney problems according to Dr. Jim Norton.  I just change diseases sometimes.  Yeah.  Because it's fun, you know.  Or treatment anyway.  Sorry.  Why did he die?  I don't know.  Dr. Norton gave him dialysis when he had cancer.  He had a hand injury and he fixed his feet.  He had bunions.  Fool I am.  Yeah.  And they had to use the Halloween music behind that to make it more scary.  Yeah, to make it scary.  They want to scare you.  Are you normal?  Thursday at 11 on News 8. 
[00:41:00]  Are you normal?  It's a little vague.  This is becoming one of my favorites right here.  Could your house be making you fat?  Tomorrow from CBS 2 News at 5.  Your house.  An interview with the gingerbread people.  Yeah, your house is making you fat.  And the ingredients in shampoo that can make a boy develop breasts.  Good night at 10.  You know, sometimes they are just feel-good stories.  We got to get the new batch of news teases.  We can't let this bit die. 
[00:41:30]  Now, have you heard anything further on the shampoo boy breast story?  No.  No.  No.  No, they let that just fall by the way.  Sensationalism.  Sex offenders may be in your house.  And I love you.  What the hell is that?  Yeah, look in the mirror.  Yeah, exactly.  Smell dad's fingers when he saw them.  Danny's working on the news teases.  Nothing new lately.  Yeah, but we talk to a lot of people. 
[00:42:00]  You guys, you know, watch that local news.  And when you hear one of these dumb news teases, please send it into the show.  How do they do that, Iraq?  Is there an easy way to just send stuff into the show at this point?  Yeah, email danny at foundrymusic.com.  F-O-U-N-D-R-Y music.com.  Is there like a link right up on onaradio.com where it's like, I have something for the show.  Oh, I can send it right here.  Click.  We got to make it easy.  Let's work on that.  Okay, write that down.  Post that.  And finally, this one.  The problem solvers have uncovered sexual predators sent to live in our nursing homes. 
[00:42:30]  Do you really know who's living down the hall?  Could this happen to your mother?  Nice.  And that's it.  That's the News Tease Hall of Fame.  That's what we got so far.  Mom will get some action.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to JC.  JC, what's up?  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Hey, man.  I was wondering if I could make an AK-47 out of macaroni for the contest. 
[00:43:00]  That would be wonderful, JC.  That would rule.  Wonderful.  When's the due date?  No, that's just kind of a goofy contest we want to do.  But we'll display the better ones on the website.  Now, make sure you have your projects in on time.  Right.  And how should I make the bullets?  Out of macaroni, right?  Hmm.  All right.  It depends on how big of an AK-47 you make.  Yeah.  I would use maybe a little penne, some penne pasta for the bullets. 
[00:43:30]  All right.  You don't have to use just elbow macaroni.  Although elbow macaroni was very unpopular with the projects, as was the bowtie macaroni.  Really?  And then you just spray the whole thing with gold spray paint for some reason.  This looks good.  And take it home and have your father throw it out because you're a fruit for making it.  Thanks, Dad.  Your father would throw you little things out?  Of course he would.  Really?  Why wouldn't he?  Only a homosexual would make such projects like that.  What'd you make that he threw out?  A little, it was the macaroni on oak tag construction paper, and it was kind of the shape of, it 
[00:44:00]  was just sort of an abstract thing, almost like the sun, you know, but it was kind of  making that elbow macaroni and then other kind of macaroni, and I spray painted it gold.  Nice.  And it was like, oh, it's a good, just the sound of the Elmer's glue cracking and the  macaroni hitting the floor, the little gold macaronis hitting the floor. 
[00:44:30]  Like, oh, thanks.  I really should have, you know, if it wasn't so repulsive to me, I should have went gay  and really shown pop.  Yeah, almost, you said it was almost like the sun, but to him it was like his daughter.  A little fruit.  Yeah, he didn't want a fruity sun.  He thought I was heading in a fruity direction.  I was very, I was nerdy.  I was just into science and things like that.  You could have been like a great scientist.  Instead, you tell.  I should have been into drinking and chicks. 
[00:45:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, you are.  I know.  In the end, he won.  Dad wins.  Yeah.  That's true.  Thanks to dad.  We all like, you know, we're at a great job.  I don't know what I'm complaining for.  Yeah, right.  I didn't nurture you, you little sissy.  I was such a little fruit.  Be married with two kids right now.  Give me gumdrop.  Constantly cry.  I was such a crybaby.  Oh, I got a stomach ache.  Now you don't shut up.  Let's say hi.  Let's say hi to Spiro on Long Island. 
[00:45:30]  Spiro, is this something about Mastic you got?  Yes, it is.  All right, hold on a minute.  And now it's time for a Mastic moment.  As Opie and Anthony take a glorious look at this majestic Long Island community.  All right, go ahead, Spiro.  One lovely afternoon, my ex was stopped at a traffic light, and one of these fine residents  pulled up next to her, jumped out of his car, and proceeded to release what was brewing. 
[00:46:00]  Wow.  And that was a bird's eye view into the scenic town we hold close to our hearts.  A Mastic moment on the Opie and Anthony show.  I'd like to add a little trivia.  All right.  This is according to the Chamber of Commerce in Mastic.  Okay.  This is leisure activities in Mastic, and this is actually authentic. 
[00:46:30]  This is off their website.  This is off their website.  All right.  You ever go to a Chamber of Commerce website for a city, and they have leisure activities,  entertainment, food, where you can get things like that.  Kind of just fun things to do.  Yeah.  In Mastic, under entertainment, and this is the number one thing they have listed out  of their four things to do, Balloon-a-ticks, card and gift store, card and gift balloon store.  So you can go to a place called Balloon-a-ticks. 
[00:47:00]  Do you just want to firebomb a place with a name like that?  It's horrid.  They should have a-  What should we call it?  Balloon-a-ticks.  They should have a sex-a-ticks.  Sex-a-ticks.  Sex.  I'm trying to rework this.  Yeah, what is that?  All the sex offenders that live in the area.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  How about a bicycle store called Pedalphilia?  There you go.  That would be a nice one.  There you go. 
[00:47:30]  Thanks for the save.  Then they have a dynamic beat entertainment.  They're party planners there.  Aw.  That's good.  Movieland of Mastic.  It's a 10-screen movie theater.  Nice.  And Shirley Bowling Center.  Okay.  That's not bad for entertainment.  End of entertainment.  That's it?  That's all they give you to do.  A bowling alley, a movie theater.  There's a party planner, and you can get balloons and cards.  This is something you could get in any town.  Right.  I don't understand why they're highlighting these. 
[00:48:00]  For food, now this is usually where you put your finer restaurants.  So you could go to the Chamber of Commerce site and go, hey, this is nice.  Oh, I'll go to this restaurant.  Their first thing that is listed under food, Dunkin' Donuts.  Then you have the ice cream cottage, Jeff's Family Deli, and Subway.  Subway is listed under food.  And that is it. 
[00:48:30]  That completes the entertainment leisure activities in Mastic.  Wow.  Do you know, I'm going to take a stab here, that in 2007, not one person in our nation,  not one person in our nation vacationed to this town.  No.  Not one person.  Think of all of the people and all of the places to go, and yeah, not a one, I'm certain.  Not counting a visiting a family or a relative, I understand. 
[00:49:00]  Not one person.  Like, let's go to Mastic to vacation.  Yeah, like you go to a travel agent and say, I need to go to Mastic.  I used to vacation in Mastic when I was a kid.  I have to get some of those pictures.  I will bring in pictures and pop them up on the website of the bungalow we used to go  to in Mastic, and it had a pool in the back.  All the parents of the little kids used to have luau's and parties and drink like drunks 
[00:49:30]  that they were.  And my brother Joe almost died in the pool.  He fell in the pool and was drowning, and an uncle had to reach in and grab him by his  hair and pull him out, because, you know, everybody was too drunk to pay attention.  He was waiting years to reach in and talk.  Yeah.  Yeah, he just, he walked right up to the edge and kerplunked in.  He grabbed him by the hair.  Good thing Joe didn't have fallen recently.  He'd be a dead boy.  Yeah.  Trying to grab skinhead.  We have to take a break, but before we do, we have an update. 
[00:50:00]  Oh.  And now it's time for a Mastic Moment.  As Opie and Anthony take a glorious look at this majestic Long Island community.  And with that, we say hi to Steve in Mastic.  Mastic.  How are you, Steve?  Good morning, boys.  Good morning.  Good morning, little Jimmy.  Hey, buddy.  Listen, that Movieland Theater closed about six months ago.  Okay, cross that off the list.  All right.  One last thing to do. 
[00:50:30]  That one off the list.  The Balloon Place, I have no idea what that is.  Okay.  Balloonatics?  And I got one interesting fact, though.  Okay.  The editor of Vogue purchased a house in Mastic 10 years ago for $1.5 million.  Really?  No, it's a shock.  Yes.  There's a place called Old Mastic.  It's where the Old Mastic Estate was for the family of Dana that formed a town. 
[00:51:00]  And all the houses in there are along the water.  And the cheapest house in there is, like I said, $1.5 million.  And then the other side of that is the Indian Reservation, where they're not really Indian, if you know what I mean.  Yes.  Well, this is a phenomenon on Long Island.  There's a lot of Indian tribes and reservations.  A lot of the names of the towns, Patchogue, Hophog, Yapank, are Indian tribe names from Long Island. 
[00:51:30]  But for some reason, the Indians are all black people.  It's Harlem by the Sea.  They call it Harlem by the Sea.  They're all black people that say that they have like, like Earl Douglas does this all the time.  Yeah.  Earl, black Earl from the Ron and Fez show.  He says that he's part Cherokee, I think.  Yeah.  Indian.  And Ronnie just nails him on it.  But I guess if you say you have a certain amount of Indian blood in you and go through some paperwork, 
[00:52:00]  you get some of the conveniences of being an Indian in this country, an American Indian.  Yeah.  Is the leader of that tribe Geronimofo?  Geronimofo?  Wait.  Hold on, Jimmy.  Hold on a minute.  Wasn't ready for such a fine line like that.  Now I'm ready.  Boo! 
[00:52:30]  Boo!  Geronimofo.  You're right.  And that was a part-time view into the scenic town we hold close to our hearts.  A mastic moment on the Opie and Anthony show.  All right.  Why don't we take a break and regroup?  I like that one.  We got people that are working on their kid projects for the Opie and Anthony show.  Oh, good.  Look at it.  Someone wants to make a solar system.  Someone wants to make a volcano. 
[00:53:00]  Oh, cool.  What's a fusilli, Jimmy?  What is that?  I don't know that one.  I'm going to make a fusilli.  Oh, that's a type of pasta.  Oh, okay.  They're just going to make Jimmy out of some pasta.  All right.  Very good.  All right.  Phone number 877-212-018.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.  It's Opie and Anthony on your radio dial.  Jim Norton heading to Atlanta.  What, Friday night?  You got the big show, Jimmy?  No, it's, I believe, Saturday. 
[00:53:30]  Saturday night in Atlanta?  Yes.  It's Saturday at the Roxy Theater, Atlanta, Georgia.  8 o'clock, you'll be at Ticketmaster.com.  It's almost sold out.  It may be sold out.  I'm not sure.  But 404-233-Rotzy this Saturday.  Atlanta's a great market for us, man.  We've never been on Tresstio Radio there.  And it's a really popular Opie and Anthony market.  They love the show.  Thanks to XM, Satellite Radio.  Yeah, they're really good because of Atlanta, so.  We almost moved there.  Yeah, almost.  And they were trying to tell us it's like a, it's a, it's like, it's like a mini New York 
[00:54:00]  down here.  No, it's not.  And they were telling us that from a redneck bar where it was, I don't know, dart night.  It was cowboys.  Cowboys and hardcore country music was playing.  And they're trying to convince us that it's just like New York.  How about we take these?  But there are animals down there and we love them.  And we also had an offer to come to New York, so it was like, well, how about we just go  to New York?  Yeah.  Instead of this place that you're saying is like New York.  Yeah.  And obviously not. 
[00:54:30]  People!  Bow, bow, bow.  Some of these songs, man, they never get to the vocals.  I don't get that.  Yeah.  It goes on and on.  Da-da-da-da!  Da-da-da-da-da!  Phone number 877-212-0&A.  So now you got a new thing you got to do out there in Opie and Anthony land.  You got to get your Opie and Anthony like school projects together and start sending them  in.  School projects.  Retarded school projects.  And then we're going to like put them up on the website and we'll all laugh and laugh  and laugh. 
[00:55:00]  And someone suggested they're going to make a solar system.  And God bless Stephen S. from Bayshore, who does those fine rundowns on onaradio.com.  He writes...  For free, by the way, he does them.  For free, yeah.  Because he hasn't been paid in two and a half months.  Yeah.  Why has he not been paid?  You're kidding.  No, we're not kidding.  Why would he be paid?  We're trying to find old Deutschmarks to pay him in.  Yeah.  Knowing that he is also a fan of the era.  When Tracy left, no one knew to pay him. 
[00:55:30]  No.  She hasn't been gone that long anyway.  She hasn't been gone for two and a half months.  I dreamed my entire career that I would someday work in New York radio.  Yeah.  And we finally got here and...  And you realize...  Wow.  It's just as screwed up as any other city.  And I realized I should have dreamt about doing something else.  Because this sucks.  You got a guy like that who does a great job writing.  Yeah.  Right?  Who does a great job for the show.  It's like, why wouldn't you just give him what you're supposed to give him?  Yeah.  I see him at FH Riley's, my fine restaurant. 
[00:56:00]  My brother's restaurant.  400 New York Avenue in the heart of Huntington Village.  And Steven S. actually shows up with, like, cans.  His empties.  And he kind of throws them up on the bar.  And he goes, hey, fish, could I get something for this?  And then we feel sorry for him, so we collect his cans.  Okay.  And then we give him a brew or two.  What are the old Zyklon B cans?  Just empties.  What do they call them in Mastic?  You leave them on your lawn and...  Oh.  Jewelry.  No.  What was it? 
[00:56:30]  Yep.  It was something...  Clambers.  Oh, land clambers.  Land clambers?  Land clambers.  Or lawn clambers.  Yeah.  Steven S. from Bayshore is a land clamber.  He collects empties so he can drink at FH Riley's.  Jeez.  Pay the man.  Please pay the man.  Please do something.  We can't do everything for this company.  We're working our asses off.  How about, I don't know, maybe you hire a PD here in New York.  I told D-Lo last night.  He goes, so who's the PD at the station in New York?  I go, no one. 
[00:57:00]  He's like, ha, ha, ha.  Because he knows how I am.  Yeah.  Like, I don't acknowledge PDs.  I go, no, really.  We have no one.  And he goes, what?  No, Mike's not the PD.  He's acting.  Oh, he's acting PD.  But he's more a music guy.  He's really good at music.  And he's really good at, like, getting, you know, station stuff together.  And he goes, well, the GM.  I'm like, well, we sort of have a GM general manager for the people that don't know the radio lingo.  But she runs, like, I don't know, eight CBS stations. 
[00:57:30]  So we barely see her.  Yeah.  He goes, isn't it amazing?  You're in New York radio, and this is what's going on?  Yeah.  And then it continues today.  We can't even get our guy paid.  And he's not asking for much.  I think he makes, like, $100 a week to do the rundown.  Something ridiculous.  Just pay the guy.  Oh, yeah.  He's not making any real money.  He will when they finally have to pay him.  Right.  It's going to be a fortune.  It's like, wow.  You're just holding on to your money for you.  That's all.  It is $100 a week.  Save it in a bank.  Jimmy, $100 a week he makes for that great comedy writing on onaradio.com. 
[00:58:00]  But he doesn't make $100 a week because they owe him for about 20 weeks.  They're getting this guy to write a lot of material.  Yeah.  And good material.  A lot of it's taken out for content or whatever.  Yeah.  But he writes a lot for $20 a day.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Scott and Todd, they're going to, like, steal them from us.  Are they still on the radio?  I don't even know.  Are they?  Oh, they're not on the radio anymore?  I think they're on vacation.  No, but are they still doing a radio show?  I don't know.  How do you not know? 
[00:58:30]  You know everything.  Oh, no.  They blew out a few of their old other shows.  So when they're on vacation, you never know.  Yeah, the great Rocky Island was let go.  But anyway, getting back to the solar system.  So Stephen S. from Bay Show writes,  the ONA solar system should have all the show characters revolving around Fat Bob Kelly.  There you go.  That could be funny.  There's an idea for a project?  Yeah.  Right on.  Do you want another Mastic moment, or do you want to kind of rest that for a little while?  At least it's a good one. 
[00:59:00]  Well, there is a really good one.  I mean, we are trying to move on, but all right.  Hold on, man.  Let me set up.  We give them one more.  Why not?  One more.  We got two, actually.  We're going to do a double here.  All right.  And now it's time for a Mastic moment.  As Opie and Anthony take a glorious look at this majestic Long Island community.  Let's say hi to Pete and Mastic.  What's up, Pete?  Good morning, gentlemen.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Let you know that the house across the street from me and right next door to me, they still 
[00:59:30]  have outhouses.  They still have outhouses.  Oh, my God, no.  I am not kidding.  I will take pictures of them this weekend and send them in to you.  The bowling alley, if you recall, that's where two of the fine pillars of society there  accosted a retarded gentleman with a mop handle in the bathroom.  Yeah, we worked out into the whole Mastic thing yesterday.  Saturday, so very good.  And, dude, those are not outhouses, by the way.  Those are guest residences.  Yeah.  Steven S.  But Mayshore can buy a house when he gets his backpack. 
[01:00:00]  Yeah, that's true.  You can buy a house, Steve.  Poor Steve.  If you see him at FH, just buy the guy a drink.  He's an alcoholic and he has no money.  That's a bad combo.  We do have a yacht club.  Yeah.  All right.  And believe it or not, it is a beautiful community.  The people make it crap.  All right.  They really do.  Thank you, sir.  All right.  We got to move on.  By the way, Bill from Waterford, a regular on Instant Feedback, he writes,  Opie, I declare myself PD of K-Rock in New York City. 
[01:00:30]  Can you do that?  And then he writes, who will challenge me?  He's got a point.  All right.  You're in.  That's what it comes down to.  You got the gig.  Listeners just taking over radio stations.  Let's say hi to John.  I said we had a double here.  John from Mastic, what's up?  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Hey.  Thank you.  About eight years ago, a friend of mine, a Greek immigrant,  says we've got a great place to go fishing.  So he takes us to this place.  It's like a little tidal pool area.  And we get there.  They go down to get these boats that are overturned on the shore. 
[01:01:00]  And the guy picks up the boat.  It's a dead Mexican clutching a bottle like a baby.  He's been dead for, I don't know, a couple of weeks or something.  And they couldn't get a cop to come.  Oh, man.  Suffice to say, ruin the day.  And I got my school project, too.  The infamous two magnets with a piece of loose-leaf paper in between.  Two magnets?  Oh, what?  You can move the magnet in between the paper. 
[01:01:30]  That the magnets could move in between paper.  That stinks.  It doesn't suck, bud.  But it got me a medal every year in PS170.  Thank you, John.  Take care.  All right.  And that was a bird's-eye view into the scenic town we hold close to our hearts.  A mastic moment on the Opie and Anthony Show.  All right.  Something else, by the way.  We've got two problems if anyone from corporate is listening today.  Our phones are horribly low.  They've been horribly low for days on the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:02:00]  I got the pots, like, just pinned.  They can't go any higher.  And the phone levels are still very low.  And people are starting to notice, like, white beard from some town in New Hampshire.  And the other thing, I got a floaty arrow.  Fix my floaty arrow, too.  What do you mean a floaty arrow?  Maybe it's nerves.  I answer phone calls with a mouse, and the arrow just starts floating on its own.  If you pick up the mouse and shake it sometimes outward, that happens on a computer sometimes.  It's really annoying.  No, no, don't break and throw.  Shake. 
[01:02:30]  Shake?  Yeah.  Sometimes you have to tilt something.  It's tilted.  All right.  Two things to fix today.  Phone levels and my floaty arrow.  Floaty arrow.  Floaty arrow.  And we never promote who's coming in.  We always forget.  So I want to promote.  I'm very psyched.  In 40 minutes, we have two people from my favorite program from The Wire, Andre Royo and Tristan  Wilds, will be in studio.  The series finale is Sunday, sadly.  I will get to the series finale sometime in April.  That is the series finale?  They're doing five. 
[01:03:00]  That's it.  They knew for a long time.  Five.  The series finale.  Wow.  They do five and out.  Yeah.  Jimmy turned me on to The Wire, and I can't believe I didn't discover this on my own.  This show is so much better than The Sopranos.  So much better.  It really is.  Yeah.  I think so.  Because they wrap up storylines.  They have really interesting characters, interesting storylines.  And guess what?  They wrap it up nice for you.  But not Hollywood.  Not like phony.  It's just, they just tell you where it goes.  Right.  Brilliant.  So I'm halfway through season two, as I work my way through my box set. 
[01:03:30]  And now I got to watch the episodes faster, because the Philly crew, they want my box set.  So now I have to mail off box sets down to Philly.  So now I can't watch at my pace, because they're almost done with season one.  I'm only four or five into season two.  And they're calling me going, well, when he's sending season two, I'm like, all right.  All right.  I'm like, I'll start watching these faster.  The whole box set thing has become a hassle.  You got to watch them.  And then someone's always asking for them. 
[01:04:00]  Yeah.  And you go, well, I'm not done yet.  It's the only way to watch the series, because especially with The Wire, man, every episode  ends pretty solid, where you're like, oh my God.  You want to know what happened?  And then I'm thinking in my mind, I wouldn't be able to wait a week to see what happened.  All I have to do is go to the next episode.  It's perfect.  Stupid lost.  I've been watching a week in advance on HBO On Demand.  And then this last week, these bastards, they didn't show the series finale on On Demand,  so I have to wait to watch it with everybody else.  Oh, they're going to make you wait. 
[01:04:30]  It's so irritating.  Infuriating.  I'm kind of glad I don't know what happens, though.  I'm going to prod those two when they come in to spoil it.  They always do that.  Every time someone comes in from a show, they always spoil the end, don't they?  You can't get anything out of people.  Well, I mean, you know, I guess they don't want to be fired or breach of contract or something.  All right.  You have to go back over the DVDs and take them out.  So we got the two guys from The Wire.  That's very exciting for us. 
[01:05:00]  Yeah, we started the show off by saying good morning to all the Dungeon and Dragon players out there.  Yes, you might wonder why.  Well, Gary Gygak.  What?  The Dungeon and Dragon players, no.  The creator of Dungeons and Dragons has died at the age of 69.  You're kidding.  Gary Gygak.  G-Y-G-A-X.  Gygak.  Gygak has died.  He had some kind of heart thing going on, and he died at the age of 69. 
[01:05:30]  I never played that game.  I did not.  As well.  I got roped into playing once.  And then what did daddy do to you?  It was.  No, this was post-daddy.  Did he take the sword of gay and make sure you never play again?  The sword of gay.  Haven't used the sword of gay in a while.  It was so boring and stupid.  Like, the Dungeon Master could just make up whatever the hell they want. 
[01:06:00]  You roll the stupid die.  Yeah.  And then the Dungeon Master makes things up.  Oh, well, you just got hit in the leg for, you know, 50 hit points.  Like, how do you know?  I'm the Dungeon Master.  It's just stupid.  You can just make up anything you want.  Were there cards for it or something?  No.  Just dice?  It was dice.  Dice.  I want to be the Dungeon.  I'm the Dungeon Master. 
[01:06:30]  Hey, hey, jackass.  Roll the dice.  There, you just got hit.  I got my armor of a bedazzled jacket, it's called.  The armor of the bedazzler.  Oh!  You're carrying the sword of gay, though, sir.  The sword of the gay.  I hit the figatitos.  If I was the Dungeon Master, I'd go, pull down your pants.  And you would go, but why?  Well, because I'm the Dungeon Master. 
[01:07:00]  I'm the Dungeon Master.  Just make stuff up.  I'll guarantee that happened.  Really?  Yeah, with the hardcore geeks.  Because I'd just sit there and go, all right.  And then the Dungeon Master's gone, oh, oh, you're losing hit points.  Now you don't have any, your leg, your leg is not working now.  And I'm just sitting there going, really?  Is it?  Yeah.  Is it not working?  Than, do you have a little insight on D&D?  Yeah, I played with my brother once.  Once.  Everyone's played once.  Yeah.  All I remember is you had to have graph paper. 
[01:07:30]  You had to actually map your progress.  Yuck.  Like, you had to know how far three meters was.  And you just went north three meters.  And then the room is 10 meters wide.  So you get to, like, graph that out.  It's terrible.  Yeah.  Of course it is.  So you'd have to graph out.  Yeah.  I kind of remember part of that.  I didn't even get that far.  I was just like, this is so dumb.  I need something that is definite.  Not this abstract thing you make up in your head because, you know, you might be mad at  someone one night.  And you go, oh, you're dead. 
[01:08:00]  Wait a minute.  That character took me forever to build.  Wouldn't they play for, like, hours and days?  Days.  Yeah.  There was, I think there was some wizardry involved.  Wizardry.  That's why when video games came out like EverQuest and now World of Warcraft and stuff, that kind  of took off because it was the Dungeons and Dragons kind of thing, but it wasn't this abstract  Dungeon Master making up the rules kind of a thing. 
[01:08:30]  Yeah.  You know, I think that's why those games became so popular.  Main Man from Main writes, I guess God needed someone to play Dungeons and Dragons with.  Two damage!  Two damage!  No, he didn't.  Two damage!  God always wins at Dungeons and Dragons.  He makes real dragons and just kills you.  But maybe God takes his power away temporarily and has a fair game with people out there.  I don't think God can do that.  Just temporarily.  What, is he like Superman?  He goes in, puts the crystal in, and his powers are gone? 
[01:09:00]  Let's say hi to Mike in Florida.  He's at Dungeon Master.  Dungeon Master, what's up?  Not much, guys.  How's it going?  Good.  Good.  So, now, you could just kind of make up whatever you want.  Initially, it's really, really stern rules.  There's three handbooks that you play with.  And one is the Dungeon Master Guide, one's the Player's Handbook, and one's the Monster Manual.  And you have to know these things inside.  He read the Monster Manual.  Yeah, it's actually really strict.  And if you're not into reading fantasy novels, then you definitely wouldn't be into playing it. 
[01:09:30]  What if you're into LARPing?  Then you're queer.  And that's coming from a Dungeon Master.  That's right.  I don't understand.  Let's say I roll this stupid dice.  Yeah.  And a number comes up.  What happened next?  Why?  Pretty simple.  The monster that you're attacking has an armor class, which is like a 15.  You roll a d20 dice.  And see if you hit past their armor. 
[01:10:00]  If you hit past their armor, then you roll your damage dice.  And what the Dungeon Master makes up is like if you were to roll that damage dice of eight,  then he's supposed to be like, you know, you swing your sword at the dragon and hit him in the leg.  Boring.  And struck off his knee.  So it's to make it more interesting for the player?  Is that what the Dungeon Master does?  Or else it's just kind of rolling dice and marking down math?  Yeah, and you can play it both ways. 
[01:10:30]  We play it that way a lot of times where we do just trek through and we don't say all the role-playing type things.  Wait, sir, do you paint like the Dungeon Master paints the picture more?  Exactly.  I mean, you buy like a campaign setting book and you play in this world for years.  It gives you a world setting of continents, places, cities, and everything.  My dad would beat the hell out of you.  Oh, boy, would he.  Oh, would he beat you up and call you a fruit?  A lot of people calling and defending this D&D stuff.  I'm sure they are.  It's interesting.  It's a lot of fun. 
[01:11:00]  I mean, if you're into fantasy and reading those type of novels, it's kind of like you play in the world.  Why wouldn't I just play EverQuest?  As a matter of fact, once I started playing all those games, and once I started playing D&D,  you realize that every single thing in every one of those games is a derivative from D&D.  I mean, down to every single...  Except for the fact that those games are fun to play.  Can I ask you a question, sir? 
[01:11:30]  Say something in Dungeon & Dragon Master Talk.  How would you say that?  I know there's a lingo you use.  If you were to enter a room, you come to a door and you unlock the door, you enter a room,  then I would be...  You probably would have something that's predicated that you're supposed to say, like...  Boo!  Boo.  You didn't think we really wanted the answer, did you?  Yeah.  All right, Mike. 
[01:12:00]  Thank you.  See you, man.  Hey, come on, guys.  All right.  All right.  Boo!  People are calling the Trump's favorite game.  There's never been a better...  Like, every time...  I keep getting favorite clips.  Yeah.  Boo right now.  Oh, yeah.  That's my favorite.  Damn Homer's boo.  That's how my...  That's how my phone rings, because I know it's another human.  Boo!  What was Homer doing when he yells at you?  I don't know.  Now I need to know.  We've got to find out.  We'll find out.  You know, E-Roc?  He was in D.C. booing the IRS building. 
[01:12:30]  Goddamn Homer.  Let's go to Joe in Jersey.  Joe.  Joe, let's go, because we've got to take a break.  All right.  Um, I, uh...  Of course...  Just like...  Just like everybody else, I played it once.  I was, like, 12 years old, and I got roped in the plane.  It was, like, a bunch of 16-year-olds, and somehow I ended up in a human-sized brown  paper bag after one time, and suffocated and died. 
[01:13:00]  That's stupid.  I honestly think that it's like a pedophile pyramid scam.  You know what I mean?  Just how many little kids you can get in there.  If you get three under you, then he brings in three, and he brings in three.  It's just silly.  And, uh, these guys...  Ah, sugar.  Oh, sugar.  Hey, uh, we've been talking about Dungeons & Dragons for about 15 minutes.  I still don't know what the game's about.  I know Brother Elmo, a little known fact about my bro. 
[01:13:30]  Yeah.  Was a big Dungeons & Dragons.  Was he?  Yeah, while we were outside in the sunshine playing real things like baseball and football  and building forts in the woods, he'd be in his dark room at the Shades Down playing some  of his Dungeons & Dragons stuff.  He's a creep.  Oof.  We'll discuss...  Alone?  Can you play alone or no?  I don't think you can.  I think he used to play with Chris.  The Clark man, I believe.  Hey, so there you go.  You got Gary Gygak. 
[01:14:00]  G-Y-G-A-X.  The creator of Dungeons & Dragons.  He dies at the age of 69.  Big news today.  With that, here's Stephen Lynch.  Let's get a little harmonica.  I'm sorry. 
[01:14:30]  I got my 12-sided die and I'm ready to roll.  With a wizard and my goblin crew.  My friends are coming over to my mom's basement bringing Funyuns and the Mountain Dew.  I got a big broad sword made out of cardboard.  And that stereo's a pumpin' Zeppelin.  It's that time of the night.  We turn on the black light.  Let the Dungeons & Dragons begin.  It's D&D.  Fighting with the legends of yore.  It's D&D. 
[01:15:00]  Never kissed a lady before.  Nope.  Woo!  All right.  Take it home.  A little solo for it.  How much time?  Now the Lord of the Rings, the dark crystal and things.  We use these as a reference tool.  And when we put on our cloaks and tell warlock jokes, we're the coolest kids at the school. 
[01:15:30]  No, we're not.  I know.  Now Tack's a real bastard, but a fair dungeon master.  He's got hit points and charisma to lend.  And I rehearse in my room or what I call the dragon's tomb.  When I'm not out with my girlfriend.  It's D&D.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  You got a girlfriend?  Yeah.  Yeah.  No.  It's D&D.  Warriors who terrify.  It's D&D.  Virgins, till the day we... 
[01:16:00]  One, two, three, four.  Die!  Yeah.  Hey, everybody.  It's Stephen Lynch, and you're listening to Opie and Anthony.  Uh.  Uh.  One, two.  Five herpes.  Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na. 
[01:16:30]  Opie and Anthony.  What were you saying about Bob Kelly, Jimmy?  Uh, Bob Kelly's gonna be in for Jim Norton on Friday.  Uh, yeah, I'll be in Atlanta, and Bobby called me last night, and he goes,  Dude, dude, I can't stop saying,  Eww.  He's obsessed with it.  He thinks it's the cutest thing he's ever heard.  Eww.  Eww.  Eww.  Eww.  Eww. 
[01:17:00]  He said he's playing the video game.  All he's saying is,  Eww.  So I told Opie and the break, I'm like,  You gotta get a clip just to put it in his head again.  Yeah.  Bob is such a,  Bob's a simple man.  Yes, he is.  He's not bright.  No.  Bob is a lunkhead.  A lunkhead?  If you put a thought in that just empty coconut skull in his,  it just bounces around and ricochets with nothing to stop it.  I'm kind of bummed that that animation didn't win the, uh,  the short animation contest that was done.  Oh, it's better going, though.  We got the long-form animation contest that is officially on. 
[01:17:30]  We got at least $2,500 up for grabs.  We got, uh, hopefully more prize money.  We're gonna, we're looking at a venue.  We're gonna play like the 20 or 30 best ones we get in  and announce a real winner.  Uh, more details to come, but some of the details are already up on onaradio.com.  But, uh, also up there on that website is the puppet show where we talk about our new names,  which are Gregorio!  Antonio.  And I'm kind of bummed that that, uh, animation didn't win,  because that one makes me laugh so hard, 
[01:18:00]  especially when your puppet head pops into the screen and goes,  Oh, yeah.  Eee me.  It just kind of comes out of nowhere.  Yeah.  Eee me.  You gotta say that to Bob.  I was so happy that it got in his big dumb head.  Big fat head.  Oh, it's just empty, devoid of anything.  Bob's a one-thought dinosaur brain.  Yeah.  You can think of one thing at a time.  Tony L. Clippings.  I know I've been, uh, stuck all, all night with, uh,  Ned Fanny.  Ned Fanny!  I've just been, I've just been going around going,  Ned Fanny!  Ned Fanny!  Speaking of which, we got Vince in Cleveland. 
[01:18:30]  Vince, what's up?  What's going on, Opie and Anthony?  Hey.  How are you, sir?  I'm good, man.  How you guys doing?  Good.  All right.  What do you got?  That's over with.  I just, I just, I just wanted to say,  you know, you guys said no Maxwell listeners were calling,  so I figured I'd call in and voice my opinion here.  Okay.  All right.  And, uh, I must say that you guys are doing a service for Cleveland,  exposing this guy for the failure that he is.  I'm, I'm not here, and I'm not going to sit here and say you guys are the 
[01:19:00]  funniest guys in the world and you're so awesome.  I enjoy your show and you're entertaining, but this Maxwell, I'm a fan of MMS.  I listened to it since I was a little kid.  I can't even listen to his show anymore.  I wouldn't even listen, I wouldn't even listen if it wasn't to hear what he has  to say about you guys ripping on him.  We, uh, certainly acknowledge that MMS is a legendary station and it's kind of  pathetic that, uh, that's the best they could do, this dumb Maxwell show, so. 
[01:19:30]  And I, and I love how he tried to play off that booger eating like it's a normal  thing for a middle-aged man to be doing.  What he tried, what he tried to do is he put on his own site, the pictures on the,  cause he got caught out there and he's trying to empower himself by going, look at how ironic  I'm being, look, picking my nose and eating it.  But it's like, nah, dude, you got caught on the cameras.  They screen capped it.  Don't act like you meant it to happen.  Yeah.  It didn't.  Can I tell you something?  Pretty much every, uh, person, certainly every guy picks their nose. 
[01:20:00]  There's a way of doing it and it's not the way that he's doing it.  Like he's picking his nose and eating it.  It's all over the place.  It's all over our fan sites and stuff.  He is picking his nose and eating it in such a way that it looks like he's truly enjoying  it.  Oh God.  Most people do it just to get, get the nonsense out of their nose and get it over with.  This guy is savoring it.  He's a knife and fork.  It's disgusting.  Well, thank you.  He's such a whiner too.  The guy's just such a whiner too. 
[01:20:30]  Whining about everything and arguing about everything.  I mean, he always thinks that he's right and I just want to thank you guys.  Maybe you'll get him off the air, maybe.  Well, Vince, uh, my goal is to make you a hardcore listener of the Opie and Anthony  show.  I want you to call in.  I'm getting there.  I want you to call in another month or two and give us a little update.  But, uh, we're, we're taking Cleveland by storm now.  We're so excited to be on live, uh, because the last time we were on live, we just,  it's destroyed and we're hoping to do the same thing now.  So they, Hey Vince, thanks for the honesty.  We appreciate it. 
[01:21:00]  Thank you.  All right, Vince.  There he goes.  That is so funny.  He, he's forced now to put things up on his website and try to like make it seem like,  Oh, this is nothing.  So he's getting a lot of attention and I bet you that he's stupid enough to think that  the attention is good for him.  It's, this is horrific attention.  This will, this attention will eventually destroy you because you're not a funny guy.  No, they took the, they had to take the phone numbers off their own website.  It's like, stop trying to empower yourself.  Like, Hey, if you want to give us more, don't try to use reverse psychology. 
[01:21:30]  Fatso.  Not funny.  Not working.  It's not working.  Well, this is what we need the pest to do to continue.  Yeah.  Just keep, uh, keep it up, uh, pests.  I mean, you, we don't even have to tell them because they're just enjoying it.  They're, they're enjoying this more than I'm enjoying watching the wire.  They are.  They don't even savor the victory.  At this point, the pests don't even care if we talk about it on our show.  It's taken on a life of their, of its own where they're just having fun among themselves 
[01:22:00]  with this whole thing.  Can I tell you that there's a threat on whack bag about attacking Maxwell and there are,  a hundred thousand views.  Wow.  It's approaching a hundred thousand views.  Wow.  It was, I mean, it's like, we're not getting any calls.  It's like, you just, you got to be a dishonest guy.  Of course you're getting calls.  You're a fat wannabe named Benjamin Bornstein and you're dishonest.  Right.  No, they got my real name, Benjamin Bornstein.  I'm a fat Jew.  Is that right?  Is that what they're calling me?  I didn't say we're fat Jew.  No.  He called himself that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're fat. 
[01:22:30]  For the newbies, this radio show is just a small part of the entire Opie and Anthony  experience.  This, this show never really ends.  We go off the air and then people jump on their Palatoc cameras for the rest of the day  and they listen to replays and they're trading bits and making animations and making little,  little like a grammar school projects.  It just continues 24 hours a day.  They fight these battles.  Right.  And they are just notorious.  And they do it for entertainment value for themselves.  Mm-hmm.  I think that, I think they're very selfish actually. 
[01:23:00]  I don't think they're actually doing it to help us at this point.  His MySpace is gone.  It's been taken over.  It's his, like Maxwell's a douche on his MySpace page.  How does it happen?  Cool.  All right.  We got a couple things.  Anthony, you did not like the hot teen lesbian Poconos party, did you?  No, I don't think I'll be attending.  So if you're keeping track, Anthony is now single and we're trying to get him some stuff 
[01:23:30]  done.  We're trying to get him a prom date.  You know that by now.  We tried for the hot teen hot pajama party.  He's not too keen on that idea.  I just think I'll be held liable for some kind of injury at the house and I don't want  to do that.  We tried the speed dating thing.  You're not into that.  I'm not into the speed dating.  But you should be into this version of the speed dating because you get to speed blank  instead of speed date.  No.  I'm not going to be party to that.  Too old to do speed effing?  No.  I just don't want to deal with the monsters that'll come in here and I don't even want 
[01:24:00]  to talk to him.  Yeah.  Are you kidding?  All right.  Well, and then we came up with this yesterday and then we got a new one today.  No.  I'm going to surprise you with a new one.  But this is yesterday's.  Hi, if you're a hot man friendly lesbian like me, then you should come out to Uncle Anthony's  hot teen lesbian Pocono party.  Hot teen lesbian Pocono party.  Horseback riding, archery, tennis, and a **** on your chest. 
[01:24:30]  All the hottest girls between the ages of 18 and 19 are being given admission.  So don't miss out.  If you're lucky, Uncle Anthony will put his **** in your **** and then **** all over  your ****.  Mmm.  I just love Uncle Anthony's 70 year old ****.  And so will you after you drink from the fountain of Anthony and snort some of the best  coals.  The best coals.  All while bathing in the finest champagne glass hot tub filled with hot teenage lesbian  muzzle deep in the Pocono mountains of Pennsylvania.  No one will hear you scream. 
[01:25:00]  Ah!  Which makes this once in a lifetime chance even more exciting.  Spots for this incredible event are running out.  So if you're a hot teen lesbian or bi-curious girl, love older **** and duct tape on your  wrists, call 1-866-FU-LINE-1-NOW.  That's 1-866-FU-LINE-1 for Uncle Anthony's hot teen lesbian Pocono party at...  ...  ...  ...  You know what I love about that? 
[01:25:30]  That's Lisa the sales girl here in New York City.  Oh, is that Lisa?  And she's trying to sound sexy.  Sexy.  But she sounds...  She has the perfect voice of a swinger.  Ha ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  She's actually trying to sound sexy, but no, I hear swinger all the way.  I hear sloppy swinger.  Yeah.  Sloppy swinger.  So here's today's idea, Anthony. 
[01:26:00]  We're running out of ideas, so you're going to have to pick one up.  Ah, yeah, I figured that.  Just to help you along in your single life.  You ready for this one?  My quest.  The brand new one.  College can be an intimidating experience for a young lady preparing herself for the harsh  world.  But thanks to a grant from the Cumia Foundation, there's a place for you to call home.  A new sorority, Eat a Lot of Pie, is now accepting applications for the upcoming semester.  Whores, er, pledges, must be enrolled in the following courses to apply. 
[01:26:30]  E.L.P. is funded solely by Anthony Cumia's social security checks, so whichever funds  aren't allocated towards his Alzheimer's medication are spent on copious amounts of roofies and  booze.  As a new order in the Greek sisterhood, all pledges are required to speak Greek, if you  know what I mean.  And if you don't, it means you're going to get f***ed up the a** by Anthony. 
[01:27:00]  Young pledges are transported to the Cumia Mansion in lavish boxcars, where they're encouraged  to remove all clothing and jewelry.  Once you arrive at the Cumia Mansion, you'll be led to the group cleansing room, kind of  like a shower, and you'll be blessed with a patented get-to-know-Anthony speech.  The spring semester is almost here, so call 866-FU-LINE-1 now to join Anthony Cumia's sorority,  Eat a Lot of Pie.  It's 866-FU-LINE-1.  Learn to speak Greek with Anthony Cumia.  What do you think? 
[01:27:30]  What do you think, huh?  Well, again, I'm not sure how many takers there's really going to be.  I think they're going, I think you guys are going about this a little wrong.  You could form your own sorority.  Eat a Lot of Pie.  Yeah, Eat a Lot of Pie.  Wow.  How hacky is that, Steve?  If this was 1976, that'd be hysterical.  I just saw Porky's.  I wanted to capture that.  Eat a Lot of Pie.  Get it?  Yes, we got it.  I was thinking of Tapa Keg, but that one's already taken. 
[01:28:00]  Tapa Keg.  Oh, God.  Well, new bit for the show.  What do we got going today?  We got school projects.  We got working in the term brewing, something brewing.  And now you got to give your sorority name.  If you're calling it.  Eat a Lot of Pie.  Right.  Eat a Lot of Pie.  Oh, Tim came up with that?  Of course.  Tim wants credit for that hack line.  I came up with that name. 
[01:28:30]  Why are you giving Steve credit?  They're all actual Greek letters.  Ata, Lotta, Pie.  Yeah, I get it.  So, you know, it's not like I tap a keg.  Keg isn't a letter.  Oh, God.  Okay.  He's accurate.  He's being accurate.  Boo!  Why do they have to boo him?  I don't like being booed.  I don't know why he would be booed for that.  He was just giving knowledge.  That's what I think, too. 
[01:29:00]  You should change it to Eat a Lot of Ryerson and then do it.  Look at him walking back down the hall with his shoulders shrugging.  Slinking.  A little defeated.  A little defeated.  All right.  Well, you know, maybe we do a takeoff on The Bachelor.  Yeah?  Hey, Steve, could we do a takeoff on The Bachelor, maybe, with him?  Hmm.  Yeah, that could be good.  An ominous music.  Yeah, The Bachelor.  Yeah.  All right, we're trying here, Anthony. 
[01:29:30]  Hey, we have room.  Do we have time to fit in the Clinton thing?  We've been talking about Clinton off and on all morning.  She won, what, Ohio?  Obama won Vermont.  And the Texas thing, when we started our broadcast, was too close to call.  I think she's got it, though.  Although Clinton was leading in Texas as well.  It's a whole new race now, right?  Yeah.  We're waiting for the knockout punch from Obama, and it's just not coming for some reason.  Nope.  In other news, Clinton's campaign under fire for doing something else. 
[01:30:00]  A little dirty politicking going on.  What, out of the Hillary camp?  Please.  Yes.  That's being run squeaky clean.  This is from the Daily Kos.  On the right is from the Hillary Clinton campaign ad.  On the left is the real screen grab.  The Hillary Clinton campaign now says, update per Major Garrett.  Spokesman Jay Carson tells Fox that Obama's image was darkened as part of a saturation, desaturation process, typical in commercial production.  Says Obama has done it and Clinton has done it to Senator Clinton and her mother in previous ads. 
[01:30:30]  Jay Carson, the Clinton spokesman, told Fox, who said emphatically on the Daily Kos was not their ad.  We don't know what was up there, but it's not our ad.  I have no idea what was just played.  It's crap.  I got confused there somewhere.  Apparently, there's pictures of Obama that were used in an ad for Hillary Clinton.  Right.  And they darkened Obama in the ad.  Okay.  Remember, there was a controversy on the cover of Time magazine when O.J. Simpson pulled his little, I like to call, shenanigans. 
[01:31:00]  Yeah.  And they darkened him, and people were angry saying that they just wanted to make him look more black.  Than he really is.  And scare people with his blackness.  Right.  And now they're accusing the Hillary campaign people of doing the same thing.  Okay.  But, looking at it, it just kind of looked like a different hue, you know?  Like, every single picture that's put on TV isn't going to look the same, no matter if it came from the same source. 
[01:31:30]  Are they just being picky here, right?  I think they're being picky.  I think they'd be onto something if all of a sudden they have Obama looking like Idi Amin.  Yeah.  Like, Idi Amin dark.  You know, you could Photoshop his picture and really make him look dark.  I was comparing the pictures, and I'm like, eh.  It was slightly darker, I guess.  They are really trying to just dig up anything they can so they can make this a racial issue. 
[01:32:00]  It's really disgusting.  You don't really need to help it along.  We understand he's black.  Yeah, yeah.  We get it.  We get it.  He's black.  He's a black guy.  And you don't have to help it along.  We get it.  He's really a Muslim.  No.  Actually, he's not.  I know.  I know.  But he is half white.  I wonder if that picture hurt.  I mean, because she, like, you know what?  That picture was leaked, obviously, by her stupid campaign.  Oh, the one with the turban?  Yeah.  And now all of a sudden, I mean, maybe he would have lost these states anyway for labor  reasons. 
[01:32:30]  Who knows?  Maybe she's more friendly.  I don't know.  It's just picky.  Whatever.  We probably shouldn't even have played it.  I just can't wait until he knocks her out of the race.  That will really please me.  Yeah.  I'm sick of her face already.  Well, after last night, you know, she was pretty down and out.  Yeah.  And now she's right back in it.  Yeah.  All right.  We do have to cut this break short because we've got two stars from The Wire.  Are they here?  Getting ready to walk into our studio.  We're very, very excited.  I'll be honest.  A month ago, I would have been excited. 
[01:33:00]  But now I'm very excited because I'm on season two of The Wire.  You watch the show, yeah.  This is going to be good.  They're listening in the green room.  I'm a newbie to The Wire.  I'm only into season two right now and loving every moment of it.  And Jimmy has gone all the way with The Wire.  Yes.  So we'll talk to who we got in next, Jimmy.  We have Andre Royo, who plays Bubbles, and Tristan Wilds, who plays Michael Lee.  Yes.  Or Bubbles.  Or Bubbles for short.  I like Bubbles.  See, I know Bubbles.  I don't know the other guy because I'm not up to that part of the series.  It's amazing how many. 
[01:33:30]  Well, we'll talk about one together.  All right.  Cool.  Opie and Anthony.  We're very excited.  We got a couple of the guys from The Wire.  They're going to be in in about 15 minutes.  We're waiting for what?  Bubbles?  Yeah.  Andre is running a few minutes late.  Tristan is here.  Andre is running late.  You mean Bubbles?  Bubbles.  What is he doing?  Copping?  Get in here.  We got to do an interview.  He's a hardcore junkie, so it's understandable he'd be late.  Stop looking for pipes.  You're confusing him with the character.  No, no.  It's Bubbles.  I can't picture him looking any differently. 
[01:34:00]  You've never seen a bigger mess on film.  Really?  He's a disaster.  The stain on the lip from the pipe.  Really?  Yeah.  He's a mess.  He's got a rotting tooth.  We're talking, of course, about The Wire, if you don't know The Wire yet.  It's just an amazing show.  In my opinion, much better than The Sopranos.  I'm only on season two, so it could be a disaster after that.  But so far, what I've seen, I like the show way better than I ever liked The Sopranos.  Yeah, I love it.  And Bubbles is just a dope fiend. 
[01:34:30]  Just finding ways to cop.  It's a very, very honest and brutal look at drugs.  And the guy, and Tristan, who came in season four, just starts off one way and winds up another way.  Just a young, detached psychopath.  Really great, man.  Yeah.  Oh, show?  Yeah.  I just watched where Omar is in the court, testifying.  Oh, my God.  Oh, is that the one where he walks in with the tie?  Yeah, for sure. 
[01:35:00]  With Bird?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I like when he walks in.  Omar is trying to avenge the death of his boyfriend, who was a brutal, tortured death.  And he's just going in the court, and he's pinning another death on someone who didn't do it.  And he doesn't care that he's testifying.  So he walks in there in his street clothes with a tie.  And it's so funny when they go, do you see the defendant in the courtroom?  And he goes, what up, Bird?  What up, Bird?  What up, Bird?  He's just fantastic.  And didn't he basically say that Bird likes men, too, during his testimony or something? 
[01:35:30]  No, he said, because Bird didn't commit this murder.  He didn't do it.  It's back in season two.  But he's just pinning it on him.  And he said that Bird was too trifling to throw his gun away.  And then Bird just lost his mind and started to attack him.  What up, Bird?  What up, Bird?  It was so great.  This Omar character is just amazing.  Michael K. Williams.  Yeah, he's...  I could do without the nude love scenes that he has every once in a while.  But when he's walking around with that shotgun, wow. 
[01:36:00]  I like the nude love scenes.  Only...  Of course you do, Jimmy.  Don't end the...  No, no, let's not end that sentence there.  Of course you do.  All right, moving right along.  That was a semicolon.  What?  That was a semicolon.  No, it sounded like a period.  We've got to move on now with other stuff, Jimmy.  It was...  Because it really makes him a more...  A deeper character.  The fact that the guy does this and then does that.  Dude, wow.  This is how brilliant the character is.  Omar is a scary mofo.  Yeah.  Terrified.  And he walks around with a shotgun and he basically robs drug dealers of their drugs, 
[01:36:30]  right?  That's his thing.  And he has these hardcore gay scenes in The Wire.  And he has other gangsters and drug dealers calling them all the words that you would  call someone, right?  Yeah.  And he doesn't give...  He just laughs it off like, yeah, whatever, dude.  Like, he knows how badass he is inside.  It doesn't faze him.  They're calling him the F word, the Q word, the CS double word.  Yes, yes.  And he just walks around like, yeah, whatever, dude.  I'm still taking your drugs and I'm still a badass. 
[01:37:00]  It's a really great character.  It's an amazing character.  It's one of the, I don't know, it's one of the, I was going to say one of the greatest  characters ever.  That's what, I don't know.  I don't think that's a stretch at all.  He was supposed to get seven episodes in, I think, season one.  I just saw this thing.  In seven episodes, they were supposed to give him one.  And he was so popular that they just extended him.  And he became like this really weird, he's scary, but he's not because he's got this really  weird thing where he doesn't rob civilians.  Right.  He robs drug dealers.  He's got ethics.  Yeah.  He just doesn't bother with really civilians.  Oh, show. 
[01:37:30]  You have to have a gun for him to rob you.  Let me tell you something.  And we'll move on to other things if you're not into the wire.  Maybe this is going over your head.  But the lawyer, I swear to God, the guy that plays the lawyer that gets all these guys off,  the drug dealers off, if he walked into our studio, I think I would get up and punch him  in the face.  He's awful.  Because he's such an awful person.  Yep.  He's an awful, just a filth fan.  And I don't even think that, this guy's got to be an awful person in real life.  Because he's so good at being such a-  He's such a great, nice guy. 
[01:38:00]  He is such an awful person and he's everything you hate about lawyers that I'm convinced it  has to be part of his personality that he brings into the role.  I'm convinced of that, where I think I would get up and try to strangle him.  With his dumb lawyer tie.  Yeah, it's really-  Every character is-  What's his name?  Maury or-  I don't remember, to be honest with you.  I always forget.  I forget some of these guys' names.  But he's just an awful, awful character in The Wire.  But it's a great show.  Colin Quinn got me into it.  Yeah?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Colin Quinn told me, I go, it's the best show on television, you idiot. 
[01:38:30]  Yeah.  And then I started buying-  Stupid.  Yeah, stupid.  It's a show on TV, stupid.  And then I started buying box sets, which are the-  I'm an addict.  And I'm like a compulsive man.  And the box set is the greatest invention.  It really is.  Of people.  Yeah.  You can just sit there and watch the entire series.  We're being reminded, by the way, Omar, another scary thing about him.  Thank you, Chris from Jersey.  He walks around with a bulletproof vest, no matter where he is.  Yeah.  Oh, really?  That is badass.  Yeah, bulletproof vest and a shotgun.  Because he knows he's just always in, you know, he's always in trouble. 
[01:39:00]  Yeah, he's a problem.  He's a problem.  Problem, to say the least.  When he kissed that guy in the first, you couldn't believe it.  You had no idea.  Come here, baby boy.  And it was like a soft kiss.  It wasn't like a rough, get out of here, you kiss.  It was like a, let me hold you and kiss you to make you feel better.  I was okay with the last hardcore gay scene I watched, because I could tell they were like  fake kissing.  But the first time he kisses, wow, he's not faking that one.  Was it a different guy or the same guy?  It was his new boy, I guess. 
[01:39:30]  Yeah, and it was probably easier to kiss the first guy.  He was better looking.  But you could tell they were like, all right, look, let's just get this done.  You could tell there was a difference.  Like, all right, we got to do this now.  Let's just do it.  Wait, the Spanish guy?  No, he's a homeboy, I believe.  Okay, the Spanish guy is Rosie Perez's girlfriend comes later.  Oh, okay.  Okay, no, that's later.  Jeez.  I know.  Jumping ahead on me here.  It gets hotter.  All right.  Anyway, we'll have those guys in momentarily.  What a couple of fruits we are.  Of five seasons, all we're talking about is Omar's kissing scenes.  A couple of mows. 
[01:40:00]  You know, Jimmy's trying to get me into glory holes, trannies, and The Wire, and I finally  said, okay, I'll watch The Wire.  No glory holes.  No, glory holes are just fun to talk about and occasionally put something through to show  people who's boss trannies are any good man's fault.  Who doesn't like a good tranny for Pete's sake?  Blue Healer from Kentuck, Kentuckoid.  Thank you.  That's the other thing you have to do today is add Oid onto the place you're from. 
[01:40:30]  What channel is The Wire on?  Because my family would like to get into a really gay drug-using show.  It's way more than that.  Of course.  He's just one character on the show, and they're just showing you a character that they haven't  showed you before.  Like, all the cops are good, and all the cops are bad.  It's not some cornball show that makes, like, you know, just white cops look dirty.  You know, it's not like that.  It's like the black cops will beat you as fast as the white cops will.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's a great, great show, man.  The white cop who's now, like, undercover, like, buying drugs and just really getting into 
[01:41:00]  the role of being a white N.  Yeah.  He's dressing the part, and he's, like, he's chewing on toothpicks because they're, like,  they got surveillance, and they're taking pictures of, like, hand-to-hands going on.  And he's, like, just, like, really getting into the fact that he's now a white N as a  detective.  It's hilarious, man.  Yeah.  And then you got the old black Lester who's banging the young stripper that's trying to  make something of her life.  Yeah.  It's just the character developing is amazing.  Yep.  And they tie up storylines with something The Sopranos rarely did. 
[01:41:30]  Yeah.  As great a show as The Sopranos was, and The Sopranos was a brilliant show.  So, but there was certain, for some reason, I'll tell you what the difference, well, I  don't want to talk too much about the wire when they come in and I'll have nothing to  say to them.  I'll just look at them and go, hi.  Yeah.  You're Bubz.  Yeah.  Hi.  You're Michael.  Yeah.  And they'll stare back at me and go, who are you, stupid?  And I'll go, I'm a fan, and they'll be quiet for 20 minutes.  Yeah.  The lawyer's name is Levy, but thank you, your mother from PA.  Okay.  Levy.  But his first name, I think, is Mori or some just awful Jewish lawyer name.  Yeah. 
[01:42:00]  I swear, I was thinking about that the other day.  I'm like, if he walked in, I think I might have to do something.  Like, hey, what are you doing?  I'm a nice guy.  I'm an actor, you dummy.  I'm just an actor.  Leave me alone.  You know, a couple of those guys are British.  Do you know how good?  Really?  The fact that The Wire doesn't win awards every year, it makes you want to throw up.  I don't even want to tell you which ones are British, but do you know who they are?  No clue.  I didn't either until I saw them interviewed.  I thought it was a goof.  Yeah, it is weird when that happens.  I would guess Greg's?  No.  And maybe McNulty. 
[01:42:30]  McNulty, okay.  McNulty's British.  So he has a true British accent when he's doing interviews?  He talks like that.  Get out of here.  He's completely British.  And my friend Donnell is in season one and season five, and he said the only time he talks  with that Baltimore accent is when he's doing the scene.  Like when he's directing an episode, he speaks like, talks like that.  It is odd, because I know on Oz, there were some guys that were English.  Really?  And on Lost, a couple of the guys, like Saeed is English. 
[01:43:00]  He's British?  Yeah.  It's the oddest thing.  He starts talking, and he's got this British accent.  You're like, what the hell is that about?  And who was that?  The other guy that played, he was out of BC on Oz.  He's British?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's British, too.  It's hysterical.  They're like, yes, hello.  Are you seeing Mr. Echo are the same guy?  Yes.  Yeah.  Oh, that's why he looks familiar. 
[01:43:30]  He's bigger.  Yeah.  He's like, heavier.  Oh, I didn't recognize him when he wasn't raping someone.  That little beanie on the side of his head.  All right.  Yeah.  He's a really good actor, man.  He's really good.  I've seen him in two things and didn't know he was British.  Yeah.  And also, Stringer Bell.  Mm-hmm.  He's British?  Yes.  He worked as, I believe, I'm almost positive, he worked as a bouncer at Caroline's.  Patrice knows him.  To get, and I'm sure I saw him and just didn't know that he's an actor, trying to get the 
[01:44:00]  American accent down.  Stringer Bell is British, and also Lester is British.  There are some guys that are so goddamn good at that.  Yeah.  It's amazing.  I can't do a New Jersey accent, and that's where I was raised.  That is wild.  Oh, yeah.  House.  Yeah.  The guy that plays House.  House.  Hugh Lars.  He's British, too.  Yeah.  Let's move on, because we're going to get the guys from the wire in in a few minutes here,  but we have a great story about this black woman finding the N-word in some kind of typing  software.  Yeah.  What is this about? 
[01:44:30]  Listen to this.  A software snafu.  It's hard to believe what passage from literature actually made it onto a typing test.  Yeah.  It's a word.  Not just one word.  Not just this particular word.  It's the N-word.  And let's go to Mike Dellastrito with more on this incredible story about this word that  was on a typing test.  Sam and Pallas.  It really is unreal.  This woman goes to Office Depot, hands over $20, and takes home this software with this  typing test.  So she sits down at her computer, and there it was, the N-word in black and white right  on her computer screen.  It's been a tough 12 months for Monica Lodeholt. 
[01:45:00]  I was hit by a car last year.  Finally back on her feet, but at home and out of work, Monica bought Perfect Typing Pro,  hoping it would help make her more marketable in a job search.  At first, I was really pleased with it.  Then, the typing exercise surprised.  I was just in shock.  Listen to the passage that popped up.  We were working like on grub wages without a ghost of a chance. 
[01:45:30]  That has to be...  That has to be a quote out of something.  Out of literature.  Only because it says grub wages, and no one says...  Yeah, no one says that.  Right.  That's got to be...  But you think they'd be a little more selective?  Yeah, yeah.  Depending on what you...  I mean, it shouldn't matter, especially if it's just taken from literature, but I'm sure  you could get another passage.  There's a better one to take.  If you're putting out a software thing for typing, perhaps that's not the place for it.  Yeah.  How about what up, bird?  What up, bird?  Oh, show.  I love that. 
[01:46:00]  That's so funny.  Dude, it's...  And when he walks into the...  I'm sorry.  Back to the...  When he walks into the courtroom, he kind of points with the little gun thing, like,  yo, at the drug dealers that he's about to wreck in court.  Yeah.  It's so fantastic.  My new thing is to walk around my apartment with my fiance.  Fiance.  She's got to think I'm completely nuts by now, because now I just talk in Omar.  As long as you don't act in Omar.  No, no, no, no, no.  No, no, no, bud.  I've invited some gentleman over.  But she'll ask me a question.  I'll go, fo' show. 
[01:46:30]  Fo' show.  Here's the second part of the story here.  The N-word buried near the bottom of one test.  And I stopped.  I said, what did I just type here?  There it was, sitting on the screen.  What looked like a sick joke to Monica.  I was hurt.  Kind of sick joke.  And I was angry.  It pushed her buttons, and she pushed back.  Typing a fiery email to manufacturer Cosme Corporation.  They tell...  Using the word 50 times.  It is...  Huh?  Using the word 50 times in her letter. 
[01:47:00]  Right.  Well.  They tell CBS 13, it is in no way something we would ever desire to have in our software.  It was a mistake not caught by our quality assurance team.  We responded to the user, thanked her for bringing it to our attention, and apologized.  Monica's surprised they're saying sorry.  After all, she says she hasn't heard a thing from Cosme.  No phone call, no email.  No phone call, no email, no reply.  The company already has a fix.  It's offering a patch that'll pull the plug on the racist reference. 
[01:47:30]  That's a quick fix.  But I still would at least appreciate a response.  I think I deserve that.  And what could be the most amazing part about this story is that this software, Salmon Palace, has been on the market for upwards of three years now.  And Cosme tells me today that this is the first that they're hearing of this word being in their software.  That is so hard to believe.  Yeah, that's what I'm wondering if it really is, or was this the first time a television station contacted them about that?  Exactly, that's a good point, Alice. 
[01:48:00]  All right, Mike.  Thank you very much, Alice.  Good point, Alice.  Thank you.  Do you realize at the beginning of the piece there she said snafu, which, you know what that means?  It just means like something's not working.  Yeah, do you know what it's an acronym for back in the big, the great war there, the big war, World War II?  I'm going to learn something for the first time.  I really don't know.  It is an acronym.  And it means situation normal, all m'd up. 
[01:48:30]  F'd up?  Yeah.  That's what it means.  That's what snafu means.  It's kind of like, I can't think of one, but there's a million of them that we use in common language.  Of course, I think of none.  Yeah.  That's a good one.  It's like, yeah, that one.  That's good on a radio show.  A thing.  But it does.  It means like a foobar.  Fobar is another one.  Right.  F'd up beyond all recognition, reasoning, whatever it is.  Is it recognition? 
[01:49:00]  Yeah.  But, you know, and she just blurted that out like, but it's got a bad letter in it.  Like the N word.  All right.  We're kind of stalling because I guess Bubz is like copping dope somewhere up in Spanish  Harlem.  He was on, they said at last, at last, he was on 112th and second.  If you, that must've been 20 minutes ago.  And Roland's like, hey, I'm great.  Yeah.  And if you know anything about New York, 112th and second, if he's, if he's, if he's, if  he's parachuting out of a plane, he should be here in a moment. 
[01:49:30]  If he's in a cab, he'll be here at 3.30 this afternoon.  Depends on how he's traveling.  If he can even get a cab up there.  Yeah, exactly.  What is he doing up there?  He probably, I don't know.  He's from, uh, he's a New Yorker.  He's from Brooklyn.  Yeah.  Is he an actor or is he really a dope fan?  Oh, no, he's, he's an actor, man.  He's, have you ever seen him in anything else?  No, but he.  Bubz?  No, but none of these guys have tremendously long resumes.  That's, at least, uh.  That's the beauty of it.  Sure.  They're all on them.  You get some, you know, fresh faces.  Hey, uh, we're trying to get some of that Omar stuff on the radio, the, the clip from  the court, which is, makes Jimmy and I laugh. 
[01:50:00]  It's just so great.  What a way to, what a way to, do you see the defendant in court?  What a way to address him.  Changing gears, uh, it's coming out today, um, John Ritter, his final voicemail.  Ooh.  He had a slight problem and he was going to be all right, but, and he left a message,  I guess, on a voicemail and that would be pretty much his last words to his family anyway.  He had a torn aorta, which, uh, I don't think they fixed that.  There's a lining in your, um, in your arteries and the lining separated from the tube that 
[01:50:30]  makes up your, your artery.  Like there's an inner lining.  Right.  And, and, and it, it kind of broke off the inner lining and clogged up his aorta.  How does that happen?  I don't know.  It's some kind of, uh, defect.  Ugh.  You know?  All right.  Nasty.  Well, listen to this.  A tearful, emotional testimony as John Ritter's widow recounted her husband's final hours.  Ritter's family has already reached a settlement with the hospital and other medical personnel  for a reported sum of $14 million. 
[01:51:00]  But they are now suing two doctors who they say failed to recognize his heart abnormality  and treated it instead as a heart attack, which they say only made matters worse.  In a voicemail message, his last words to his wife, it's...  Why do they have to go with the dramatic?  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  I hate, I hate these programs.  Sometimes you just, you don't need the dramatic.  It's dramatic enough.  This guy's order is exploding and he's about to say, uh, the final words to his family. 
[01:51:30]  You know, you don't need to like pump it up whatsoever.  Lost words to his wife.  It's clear John Ritter had no idea that he was dying.  Hey, honey, this is John.  Hey, I'm in my dress room. I'm feeling very well.  You know, I'm puking and sweating and stuff like that.  And I think I ate some bad sweet potatoes and pork left out of the sun.  I don't know what I did.  I don't know. I'm sick.  So we were called a doctor and take a look at me, and I'm here by a review.  Oh, my God, the hair's standing up. 
[01:52:00]  Look at this.  I got goosebumps.  It was hard to hear.  What was he saying?  He thought he might have eaten bad pork or something.  Oh, yeah.  What do you got, Danny?  Yeah, he thought he had bad potatoes and pork that was in the sun.  So he was going to see a doctor.  Wouldn't it be funny if he said, I think I had some bad pork, either I tore my aorta?  Yeah.  My heart is falling apart.  It's either food poisoning or an exploding aorta.  I either got bad clams or I'm about to fall behind the couch for the last time ever.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  So he thought he had some kind of food poisoning?  Yeah. 
[01:52:30]  Somebody had really bad indigestion.  Yeah, he says in the clip that he was puking and sweating.  Right.  And I guess he was on set for something, and they had called him a doctor, and that's what  he was.  So he was leaving a message for his wife just saying he was going to the doctor.  I said aorta.  That's a long-hour thing.  Aorta.  Aorta.  Aorta.  Aorta.  Aorta.  Ritter's wife, now widow, Amy Yazbek, testified in his wrongful death trial that he left him  a message just hours before he died suddenly from a torn aorta.  His former co-star says he was drenched in sweat. 
[01:53:00]  He obviously was not feeling well, and he was sweating profusely is what I really remember.  And we didn't know what was going on, and he didn't complain.  But that was how John was.  Now, you should know, both doctors are denying wrongdoing.  The radiologist testified that the aorta was a normal size two years earlier, and that  he suggested follow-up for heart disease.  Now, damages for pain and suffering are limited to $250,000 in California, but the family is  asking for $67 million because they believe he could have earned that much over the course 
[01:53:30]  of the TV show, which was early in its second season.  All right.  Thanks, Juju.  Juju.  He was clearly a magical man.  Oh, shut up.  Oh, go, screw.  If he was magical, he could have fixed his aorta.  Absolutely.  Sprinkle some fairy dust on his chest.  Yeah.  He was truly a magical man.  That's a news commentary.  A magical man.  A magical man.  He would have used some of that wizardry.  Wizardry.  Wizardry to repair his aorta.  He was a magical man, Pat O'Brien, to have come back from what he's...  Although now they're dumping him. 
[01:54:00]  Oh, that's it.  He's...  Yeah, they've had it with Pat O'Brien.  He went back into rehab, right?  Yep.  Which I think breaks his contract.  I think they had a special cut.  I'm sure they said you gotta keep clean.  But then with his contract is now like...  Yeah.  Keep clean or you're out.  You can't do coke and make calls for prostitutes at three in the morning.  With Betsy.  You're on TV, you idiot.  Where's Betsy?  That's all I want to know.  Well, if you know...  Stupid Betsy.  He goes to rehab.  Whore.  Yeah.  He goes to rehab.  Donny Osmond is now in his place and doing a great job.  So they're like, we don't need this clown anymore. 
[01:54:30]  Me, you, Marie Osmond, Omar, Bird.  Omar.  Omar.  What's up, Bird?  You want to hear it?  We got the clip.  Oh, you got it?  Yeah.  The great Omar from The Wire.  And do you see the gunman who killed Mr. Gant anywhere in the courtroom today?  Hey, yo, what up, Bird?  For the record, you are identifying the defendant, Marquise Hilton.  It's just Bird to me.  It's just Bird to me.  Yo, what up, Bird?  And you gotta understand, this guy didn't commit the murder.  He's just sitting there.  Street clothes with a tie loosely around his neck. 
[01:55:00]  And Bird is a scary...  I would say Bird has the scariest face of anybody in The Wire.  Really?  Bird is the most murderous...  That dude right there is the most murderous looking dude that they got for that entire  series.  He's just a frightening looking guy.  Yeah.  And he's sitting there in the same posture that a man who's a gangster being falsely accused  by a homosexual would sit.  Yeah.  And he is not pleased.  All right.  We need the guys to get Omar clips for tomorrow's show. 
[01:55:30]  Omar clips for tomorrow's show.  Because every time he talks, it's hilarious.  He's just fantastic.  I'll show you during the break when he walks in and he points at the drug dealers.  Yeah.  He's hysterical.  All right.  Either way, we're talking to someone from The Wire after the break.  Absolutely.  Either both of them or one of them.  Yes.  But we gotta get this done.  So, quick break.  We'll be back with who?  Who, Jimmy?  Tristan is here right now.  Okay.  And at last call, Andre was somewhere on 95 in Connecticut near Hartford. 
[01:56:00]  He's going north.  He's gonna go through Rhode Island and then hit Boston and grab a flight to JFK.  Hopefully, he'll be here soon.  That would be Bubz.  Yes.  Who's copping dope somewhere.  Yes.  And then we'll join our show.  Yes.  Hopefully, after the break.  Opie and Anthony.  When you walk through the garden, you gotta watch your back.  Well, I beg your pardon.  Walk a straight and narrow track. 
[01:56:30]  If you walk with Jesus, he's gonna save your soul.  You gotta keep a devil.  Way down in a hole.  Here, check it out.  The Opie and Anthony show.  Of course, the theme song from The Wire.  Which changes every year, by the way.  They have a different version every year.  A different person singing it every year.  Yeah, I just noticed that.  Because I'm in the second season.  It's a bluesier version.  And who do we got in studio, Jimmy? 
[01:57:00]  Tristan Wilds, who came on in season four.  Yes, sir.  And I couldn't be happier right now, because Tristan and I are talking during the break.  And I'm like, were you a fan of the show before you actually auditioned and got on it?  And he said, yeah, man, but when they killed Stringer Bell, and up goes, another one down.  I'm trying to avoid spoilers right off the bat.  And I already know, Omar's gonna be dead eventually.  Stringer Bell is gonna be dead.  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:57:30]  Wonderful.  Jimmy's just getting me back, because when we talk about loss,  that Jimmy will throw his headphones and cover his ears so he doesn't hear spoilers.  So he's getting me, whatever.  So yeah, that really was.  Now, you play Michael in season four.  And how did it come about that you got the part?  Because you had a really great role.  It's almost like, in a weird way, like a Michael Corleone thing, where you start off as this sweet kid.  And you become really like this person capable of murder, like really detached. 
[01:58:00]  Yeah, well, actually, when I first auditioned for the role, I auditioned for, don't laugh, I auditioned for the role of Randy, the snitch.  Which, oh yeah, in season four, there was a little snitch who was certainly not the character you are.  So I auditioned for him, and I guess they liked me enough to call me back for another role.  So they called me back for the role of Michael, and they picked me.  But playing that role, man, it's just like you said.  It was like a kid who seemed like he was just real cool, real quiet, just take care of his brother, all of that. 
[01:58:30]  And wound up, you know, I don't want to spoil nothing.  No, just go, just go.  Let her rip.  Just wound up killing people, you know?  Yeah.  It was a great scene, because he plays a guy, the mother's a drug addict, and horrible, and the stepfather's in jail.  And the stepfather comes back, and the reason that the character Michael gets into the, working for this guy Omar, who, I'm sorry, Marlo, Marlo.  So Sancho, who becomes the new kingpin, is because there's a, obviously, yeah, no, no, I don't want to get into it, but once Stringer Bell is dead, just things change. 
[01:59:00]  I'm going to take a walk down the hall.  And all I'm going to say is this, just look forward to Marlo.  You've got something great to look forward to.  All right, very nice.  Good.  And there's an implied sexual abuse.  He's got a younger brother, and the stepfather comes back to jail, and there's an implied sexual abuse that you obviously suffered, and that the kid's about to suffer.  And so you go to these guys and basically give them you if they will kill him. 
[01:59:30]  Yeah, exactly.  Wow.  It's a really intense, it's one of the best beatdowns ever filmed was when, you know, I remember I was on set that day, and I got to watch it.  And, man, like, just watching Banga, who plays Chris, just watching him beat down that character, everybody on set was just like, wow. 
[02:00:00]  Like, how do you, and because they had, like, a doll to act like, to show his face, because they couldn't really beat down the real guy.  No, of course not.  He beat him to death.  So they had a doll there, and when I tell you Banga wrecked this doll's face, like, his jaw was pushed back into his mouth.  It was crazy.  And there's a character, Snoop, who's actually, her name is Felicia Pearson, I think, and she was a real Baltimore problem. 
[02:00:30]  Like, you know, she was like, I think, I don't know if she's a drug dealer, but she came from the streets of Baltimore.  For real.  Exactly, yes.  Hardcore.  They based her character, the character Snoop, off of her real life.  She got out, she went to jail for whatever she did, and she got out, and, you know, she changed herself.  So then they were interested in her story, so they bought it, and they bought her with it.  So she could tell it.  And there's a, and you have a very powerful scene. 
[02:01:00]  You might want to cover your ears.  Yeah, please.  I already read it on Instant Feedback.  That's another one down.  First, but before I get to that scene, let me ask you a question.  When Omar got killed, I'm not going to, I was shocked that they did it.  You were?  Couldn't believe, yes.  I wanted a gun battle.  I never realized what a Hollywood-ending horse's ass I am until they shot Omar, and I'm like,  all right, look, bring him back next week.  I'll forget it ever happened.  I'll let it go. 
[02:01:30]  I don't need consistency.  Consistency, just make him walk around again.  You couldn't believe he was dead because it was before it was supposed to happen.  You were hoping for a dream sequence.  Of course.  I really, I would have expected it.  Oh, okay, that was a dream.  If he was crazy, he would have just got up and went, oh, I'm back from the dead.  I was like, it couldn't happen.  It couldn't happen.  We don't know what he did.  You just wanted him back.  Actually, honestly, I didn't think it was like, it didn't shock me because last season when  I went to Marlowe and I asked Marlowe for the thing that he did for me, which was to kill 
[02:02:00]  the stepfather.  Exactly.  His boyfriend was looking out the window and his boyfriend said, who is that?  And Omar looked out the window and said, he's just a kid.  So that shows you that he just underestimated kids.  Yeah, very true.  Very true.  Because there was a, and that little kid, Kennard, who shot him.  Oh, was he a psychopath?  You can just see it.  Yeah.  Wasn't he like, he called him a gimp when he was limping?  I mean, you know, and he was shot by a little kid and you just, you never, did you know 
[02:02:30]  that was coming in the script or no?  Honestly, I didn't know.  But when I seen it, I wasn't surprised.  I wasn't surprised at all because of how he didn't back down and how he was following  him during the, um, during, um, I think it was episode eight.  You just, you just knew that something was going to go down.  Well, see for to you though, it was just Michael laying there.  Like, ah, look at Michael laying there with the makeup on his head.  For me, Omar had just been shot.  I was, it ruined my week.  Like I was really, really, but it also to me saved, like the integrity of the show 
[02:03:00]  is completely intact because that's what had to happen.  He's not a superhero.  He's just a guy who robs drug dealers and who's as vulnerable to being shot as anybody  else.  And it really, to me, made the show that cemented it as one of the greatest shows I'm ever going  to see because they killed a guy I loved before they, they could have, they could have  let him go on.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And they didn't.  And then you, you in the, in the week after, what a great scene you have in the truck.  Oh boy.  With, uh, yeah, you don't want to cover.  Oh, he, uh, he, he shoots. 
[02:03:30]  Now, did you know you were going to wind up killing, uh, Snoop or no?  Honestly, I didn't.  I didn't.  And when we did that scene, I kind of, I kind of had a little problem with it because my  first season, me and Snoop, we really got, we really got close.  Like she's my big sister to me.  Yeah.  So to actually go through with that scene, it took a lot out of me.  Yeah.  Really?  The line to me, that it was such a great way to do it.  They just know how to kill people.  I know we don't have that one.  I should have asked you to get that one, but I didn't think to get it. 
[02:04:00]  Um, was, uh, uh, Tristan and Michael and Snoop are in the truck and, and she's taking  him to be killed.  Oh boy.  And, uh, yeah.  Oh boy.  And he knows it.  So he pulls a pistol on her.  He's like, pull over.  I got to take a leak.  It's really, it's like, it's like the Godfather when, uh, when Clemenza.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I got to take a leak and, um, and she's a hardcore lesbian and she doesn't play games  with guys and I get pointing the gun at her and then she just kind of looks away and she's  like, how's my hair look, Mike?  And you're like, you look good girl.  And you just, you shot her.  And it was such a bizarre piece of dialogue. 
[02:04:30]  What was, do you have any idea what they were doing?  It was, I have my theory, but I want to hear yours.  If there was a reason for that.  I mean, I honestly don't know.  You'd have to ask the writers, but my theory behind it is like, you know, this is Snoop knew  what, Snoop knew what was going to go down.  They knew what they, what they bred because that's what they did.  They bred me to be this way.  So they knew what they, they knew what they bred inside of me and they, she knew what was  going, what was going to go down.  So her last moments were trying to feel like a girl. 
[02:05:00]  So how does my hair look?  Yeah.  Something nice, right?  Just wanting to hear something nice.  Wouldn't it be funny if you asked the writers and they're like, no, no, she was just concerned  about her hair.  She improv'd that.  Yeah, she just wanted to know how her braids looked.  That's it.  It was wanting to feel like a girl though.  I got a general question because I really don't know, uh, not yet, but a general question.  A lot of people, actually, this is coming in.  Uh, a lot of the actors don't seem like actors, like they're real street thugs is what's the  deal with that?  Do they get a lot of guys from, uh, the hood or, I mean, or maybe saying the hood is pretty 
[02:05:30]  white of me.  I don't know, but from the streets, there, there are a couple, I can't say that they don't,  but there, there are a couple of people that are from the streets and there are a couple  of people who are actually actors who are just tremendous actors.  Like, like people who you would think like Wood Harris or, or the guy who plays Stringer  Bell, um, Idris, Idris Elba.  You would think those dudes, oh my God, uh, these dudes are actually killers.  Oh my God, Omar's really a killer.  When really you meet these guys in the street and they're real actors, they're like professional 
[02:06:00]  actors.  They, they do this.  So you're acting since 2003.  I was reading in your, in your bio.  Yes, sir.  And, um, what do you got going on now?  I know you have other projects.  You're going to get a lot of work out of that.  Um, praying to God, but, um, I just finished a movie, uh, it's called The Secret Life of Bees.  Me, Dakota Fanning, Alicia Keys, uh, Queen Latifah, such a, such a.  Very nice.  Uh, wow.  No, Bubz has entered the studio.  Andre Royo has, you know, it's Bubz, bro. 
[02:06:30]  I got lost.  I got lost in the streets.  And then, and it looks like the rehab did you well, man.  You look really good.  He has all his teeth.  You look great.  You look great.  The first thing I did when they yelled cut was go bust my teeth.  Get all that make-a-ball.  Can I ask you a question?  I've been wanting to ask you this too, because a buddy of mine was in season one of five.  It was your story where, did a guy actually, uh, a drug addict actually approach you in  the streets and, and hand you drugs?  Yes.  What was that?  Because it-  It was, um, it was during the first season and it was in the later part of the show where 
[02:07:00]  I had been out and about doing, you know, a couple of, a couple of scenes and I was  at the bench looking really, really messed up.  Just found out that, uh, Keem McGregs got shot and wasn't going to be there.  And I guess my emotions or I emoted it.  I was walking back to my trailer and some, uh, fellow junkie just came up to me and was  like, yo, you look like you need a hit and handed me a tester.  And I was like, you know, I didn't even know, you know, you know, you shake so many hands 
[02:07:30]  and you say what's up to people.  He gave me a handshake.  I went in my trailer, looked down and I was like, oh, I just got the, I just got the street  Oscar.  I just got the street Oscar.  Street Oscar.  I just got the official, you're doing okay.  Everything is doing good.  You, uh, official junkie of the streets.  And you, by the way, uh, besides being a brilliant actor, man, I mean, I mean, it's frightening  how good you are.  Um, it's, you blog, I love the fact that you were irritated and you should have been  irritated at the way.  Has the wire ever won an Emmy? 
[02:08:00]  No, we never even been nominated.  That's not, it's not even about the winning.  Like we just, we just want to go to the, you know, the table, get some free champagne,  get a swag bag.  And just a little acknowledgement that you're doing something pretty cool.  It was just, you know, from the first season to the fourth season, um, it was just weird.  We really love the fans and the audience that's out there and really are true dedicated fans  of the show, but it was just a little weird that from every paper, from the Village Voice  to the Times was like, we're the best show on television or we're one of the best shows 
[02:08:30]  on television, but from the SAG to the Golden Globe to the Emmys.  Sometimes even the NAACP.  Never been nominated for like the best ensemble, best drama, nothing.  I wonder if it's because.  That's so weird.  What is that about, you think?  You know, you know, we could talk all day.  No, I mean.  So many reasons, so many ideas, you know, conspiracy theories or just reality of, you  know, we're talking, our topic is too real or too in your face and abusive or, you know, 
[02:09:00]  more than four black people on the screen and they don't know whether they're watching  HBO or BET.  You know, they get a little confused.  It was, if you don't shoot in New York or LA, you know, consider it outside the margin.  Like if you shoot in Baltimore, it don't really count.  Like when there's just so many, maybe, you know, the judges are just a little too old  for the show.  They don't really get it.  I mean, there's so many different.  It's mind boggling to me.  I mean, I can't believe with, with, with, with the work that's been done on the show. 
[02:09:30]  I mean, it's, it's sickening to me.  I'm not saying that.  I'm sure Kiefer Sutherland is great, but there's, it's terrific.  He says he saves the world.  There's no way.  There's no way that sissy is better than you.  There's no way.  It's an impossibility that he pulls off more than, than, than, than Michael Williams.  I know the cops, my favorite cop is bunk.  I'd have to say he's my son.  One new piece.  What's your favorite, uh, what's your favorite scene that you've done in the series?  That I've done?  Yeah. 
[02:10:00]  Um, oh, that's a hard one, man.  Cause you know, bubbles, I don't even remember.  Just being so, uh, into it.  If I, if I think back to favorite scene that really bugged me out where I knew this character  was crazy and, you know, the writers was wild would probably be when I was on the roof  and I really fished down with a little fishing line.  And, you know, I grabbed a bag of, uh, of drugs from a, uh, tire and I fished it back. 
[02:10:30]  And I, you know, I did it and I felt real little rascals.  I felt real like, like, yo, this is crazy.  And then I talked to one of the creators at Burns and, and everything I've done on the show,  the real, you know, bubbles was a real character.  And he said that this is, this is how, how desperate or how fiend out they were.  They were geniuses on how to get high again.  The scene, the scene is you're on a roof, bubbles on a roof and the drug dealers don't  hold the dope.  It's always like, you know, in a tire or somewhere so they can't get, you know, possession.  So he fishes down with a, uh, take it easy. 
[02:11:00]  All right.  I like pictures too, but it's like flash, flash, flash.  No.  It's like, oh, he chased Diana to her death a few years ago.  It is, uh, there's, uh, is, uh, is, uh, is bubbles on the roof and he lowers this fishing  wire into a great scene.  Oh, you, oh, you saw that one.  Yeah, absolutely.  Picks the dope out.  Yeah.  And it's just, and then he, and they see it.  They see it.  And then I run downstairs in the high and I see these other cats getting beat up.  Horribly beaten.  Yeah.  And it's just like, oh,  I'm just like, I'm like, oh, that's really messed up. 
[02:11:30]  I'm out.  Yeah.  So it was just deep on understanding that, you know, you look at these people and you  kind of be, you're very dismissive about their, their mentality.  Cause you just think, you know, they're junkies, you know, but there was a street smarts on  how to survive and how to make sure you get high.  They put some thought process to it.  Absolutely.  It was amazing.  I'm, I'm, I'm a new fan.  I'm on season two.  Jimmy turned me on today.  And I'm like, yeah, whatever the wire, the wire.  And I finally got it for Christmas.  And I'm, I, I, I, last night alone, I watched three episodes and all I want is for you to 
[02:12:00]  clean up your act and just walk off into the sunset.  I, you know, and you get close.  I've been wanting to get clean for a minute just to, just to get a girlfriend, just to  get a girlfriend.  I've been trying to get clean.  Cause you're so, you're so lovable as this character.  Like, oh, you just want good things to happen for Bubz.  And I just know it's not going to happen.  I'm not dumb.  Well, let me just say that, uh, Bubz has a few really bad things happen.  I, I, I, it doesn't go well for Bubz. 
[02:12:30]  I understand that.  I go, I go through it a little bit.  Yeah.  A little bit.  Yeah.  But let's just say that the things may look up at one point.  I don't want to blow it for you or anybody else that hasn't seen it, but I've been watching  it.  So let me say, I'm really happy with the way things are working out for you in season five.  Thank you.  Um, well now I know it lasts till season five.  That's good.  Well, you have to think though, would they have Andre out doing press if he didn't?  They would never, like there's no way they're going to bring out like, you know, no dead  guys do press.  Yeah, you can't.  What's that?  No.  Also it said you questioned, cause I do the same thing and, and I'll admit that he did it.  You questioned every year, this new storyline they have, like, what are you guys 
[02:13:00]  thinking and then when did you finally realize like, oh, okay, they kind of know what they're  doing.  You just, you never do.  You never do.  I mean, the fourth season when, uh, Tristan and, and, and all the kids came through, you  know, we were at first, I mean, the, the Y has always been on the cusp of being, being  canceled and every year they go, you know, at the third season when we were, when we was  done with the Ballsdale storyline, they said, the show's over guys.  You can find something else to do.  I moved to LA. 
[02:13:30]  Like, the show was done.  Wow.  I, I was testing, uh, I get the shows.  My name is Earl.  Tested for that and it got to a point where they were like, oh, you got to choose.  David Simon called up and was like, listen, you can do what you want to do, but I think  we're going to get picked back up, come back down or go do your thing.  And I guess I'm, I'm staying with the wire and they're like, it's going with the kids.  And I was like, are they turning this into fat Albert?  Oh no.  Oh, this is going to be bad.  This is a mess.  We screwed up now.  Cause you just, you just feel so, you know, you really don't want to disappoint your fans. 
[02:14:00]  And it's such a show that, you know, the fans were dedicated and really sat through and  watched every episode and they get, you know, to watch the storyline from the beginning to  end, you feel, you know, like you, you invested this time into the storyline.  So when you switch it, you feel like, oh man, they're going to be disgusted.  Yeah.  And you know, the kids came through, it was fantastic.  And even after the fourth season where we blew up, where the critics were like, oh wow,  this is the best show on television.  One of the best shows on television. 
[02:14:30]  Come to the fifth season, you still doubt it.  Cause then I went to the, I went to Ed Burns and David, like, how do we do better than four?  Yeah.  And you know, these guys, I don't know if it's the money or the intelligence, they just  have an ease about them.  And he was like, well, better is the enemy of good.  We never try to get better.  We just try to consistently be good.  And you're like, whatever, just, just, just write some amazing stuff.  Cause I didn't, I didn't even think the newsroom stuff was going to be great.  I was like, we're going back into the office of a different office. 
[02:15:00]  Yeah.  It's going to be talking heads.  And then, you know, as I watch it, you know, I'm a fan, you know, we have a cast of like  40, so you, you know, I don't know what everybody else is doing.  So when I sit down and watch it and I look at it, I'm like, these guys are brilliant.  Were you sad Omar got shot?  I was like sad.  Um, yeah, of course, you know, it's, it's, it's so many different reasons because it's,  it's like, you know, a fellow colleague, you know, first of all, it's an actor who just  lost a paycheck, you know?  Only two episodes though.  He didn't miss a lot. 
[02:15:30]  Yeah.  You just feel it.  You just feel like, oh wow, man, you know, somebody else got shot.  And Omar, me and him have a, you know, a connection because me and him were both like on the cusp  of our own storyline.  It was like the bad guys, the cops, and then it's Omar and Bubbles who are going through  their journey.  One is Robin Hood and one is like the junkie little John, you know, running around.  We both were told at one point in the beginning, we don't know if you're going to be around,  maybe seven episodes, maybe.  And five years later, still be working. 
[02:16:00]  So, you know, when he got shot, it was just like, oh, they got you too.  Nah, yeah.  You got done.  You got done in by the wire.  So, yeah, it was sad.  And we have to wrap because, uh, we get, we get shut up at nine o'clock here.  The, uh, the season finale, the series finale, which I, I, I hate the fact they're ending  it and I respect the fact they are because they're going out with, with still a brilliant,  powerful show.  You got to think movie now.  With who though?  They're all dead.  Bring them all back.  Bro, what happens?  This is going to be like a bunch of, you know, three guys left in the wire. 
[02:16:30]  Yeah.  I hope you make it through the final.  I certainly hope you do.  Thank you very much, man.  It is this Sunday night at what time?  9.  9 o'clock.  Oh, 9 o'clock.  I was probably 90 minutes.  What's that?  And if you miss it at 10.  It's an extended.  Yeah.  It's longer than the hour.  Is it really?  An hour and a half.  I'll be, I'll be watching episode five of season two.  So, you know.  I'm like, no doubt.  Well, you got the newbies out there too, getting the box sets and getting turned on.  As long as they're watching.  Yeah, right on.  And we also got to promote The Wire and All the Pieces Matter, right?  Features five years of music from HBO's acclaimed drama, The Wire. 
[02:17:00]  The CD includes 35 tracks featuring local Baltimore artists, four versions of the opening  theme song, including the Tom Waits original and dialogue from the show, available from  non-such records.  So, the series finale this Sunday, 9 o'clock on, of course, HBO.  Tristan and Andre, I'm a tremendous fan.  Thank you very much.  I'm a fan of you too.  Don't sleep.  Lucky Louie was a hot show.  Oh!  Don't sleep at you!  Yes.  Damn.  Thank you.  Me and my wife, that is us all the way. 
[02:17:30]  Look at this show.  Thank you.  The critics ignored us too.  They did, man.  They did.  You had a hot show, man.  Thank you very much.  They should have got a second season.  They definitely should have got a second season.  No doubt.  You just made his, not even day, his year.  No one I love ever recognizes me.  It's always like, all right, I'll sign this for you, stupid.  So, thank you guys for coming in, man.  Thank you for having us, man.  Thanks.  Absolute pleasure.  All right, guys.  We're off to XM.  See you tomorrow.  That's what we say. 
[02:18:00]  Wow!  Wow!  Oh, my God!  Are they nice and firm?  It's not Wednesday.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  XM 202.  In the world of Radio Shock Jocks, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their options.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why?  Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice? 
[02:18:30]  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good?  Go screw!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony.  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio host, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  There's some dude who liked horses and liked the radio show and named his horses after us. 
[02:19:00]  And then let them starve.  And then let them starve.  Great.  Kind of like what we're doing to the listeners.  Starving them of entertainment.  They are sick.  Freak.  Bobby, please look.  There's one part we want you to see.  That's easy.  Are you okay?  Where entertainment is going?  These guys are watching porn.  Oh, Jesus.  What are we talking about?  We're done.  We're out.  What just goes down?  It's time for people to understand these are words.  If you don't like them, turn the dial. 
[02:19:30]  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  And here we are at XM Satellite Radio.  We love when we invite the guests over to XM and they actually take us up on it.  Sometimes they're like, yeah, whatever, dude.  You know how fucking famous I am?  I don't need your shit.  We get a polite handshake and they just say, all right, and they take off and they leave it to publicists.  And we got two very famous guys that said, you know what?  I don't have the attitude.  You don't want to come and do more radio, which I think is really cool. 
[02:20:00]  I just feel like, you know, this is Andre from the Wire, Bubbles, and I just love talking to our audience.  They sat there for five seasons and watched us.  So when we get a chance to talk, we're going to let them know how we feel.  We're going to say we appreciate y'all.  And this is like, you know, being on cable right now because I can say fuck you and, you know, I won't get beeped.  No, you're not going to get beeped.  It was funny when you mentioned that you were a fan of Lucky Louie.  Jimmy's whole attitude changed.  And then we wrapped up the first radio show, getting ready to come over to XM. 
[02:20:30]  And Jimmy's just hanging with these guys, like, you know, he's just hanging with his HBO colleagues.  All of a sudden it wasn't like Jim, the radio guy, is like, you know, me and the boys were going to hang and just kind of talk shop in the hallways of K-Rock.  He's part of the HBO fam because Lucky Louie, like a lot of shows in HBO, it was pushing the barrier on what you see on regular television and taking it to the next level and being honest about a lot of relationships.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, yeah.  You know, when I have sex with my wife, every once in a while she says the same thing. 
[02:21:00]  Okay, let the doves go.  Yeah.  Let the doves go.  Let's get it done.  I got Project Runway on TiVo and I don't want to, I need a little energy to make me a sandwich.  Just get it over with already.  Yeah, I mean, Lucky Louie to me was like a real honest relationship, you know, with the, you know, with the cursing and with the, you know, attitude of, you know, it's a struggle.  You know, falling in love is hard, but staying in love is a whole lot harder.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[02:21:30]  We had just an amazing conversation in the halls of K-Rock before we came over and I was asking Bubz, you know, if he's getting more work and I don't know, you said some really cool things actually.  Because you're, you're, you're part of the Sarah Connor Chronicles.  You had a couple scenes, couple scenes, couple episodes there, right?  Yeah, I had a couple episodes and, you know, Sarah Connor, like I said, you know, television has a lot of great shows that serve their purpose that, you know, some shows entertain, some shows, you know, just make you forget about your problems and laugh. 
[02:22:00]  And, you know, coming off the wire, you, you read these scripts from David Simon, Ed Byrne, George Palacan, or Richard Price.  These guys really articulate a character's arc with many layers and you, you, you see different sides of a character.  And, you know, so when I went through Sarah Connor Chronicles, you know, I read the script and I'm happy to be working.  It's great working with the green screen and, you know, Terminator is a classic, you know, my generation.  But, you know, I can't, I can't for the life of me understand why my character keeps shooting at the Terminator with a, with a nine millimeter. 
[02:22:30]  I know it doesn't work.  I know it doesn't stop the robot from coming.  And every scene, we just stop popping him with a nine millimeter.  Like, one day it's going to change.  You're like, ah, shit, this would never happen to the wire.  You know, they changed it up.  They, you know, they would do something that would explain why he's doing it.  Maybe he's a little stupid and he realized that, you know, two seasons before you find out he didn't go to school.  In the wire, Omar would fuck him and then take his, take his dope and fucking shoot him.  Teach him how to whistle. 
[02:23:00]  And then you mentioned law and order and said, you know, it would be played out different in the law and order.  You know, law and order has been the staple for any, you know, East Coast actor on the come up.  You had to do law and order.  You know, they really, really implore, give us a job.  You know what I mean?  They really make sure that, you know, actors are always working.  But doing it, you know, there was a scene where the cops come in.  It was law and order, criminal intent.  I'll put you on blast.  It was a scene where the cops come into my, to my house and I have a loaded gun. 
[02:23:30]  I mean, I have a murder weapon in my house.  And when they come in, I see the hallways clear.  So I ran out.  And they, you know, they yelled cut and they were like, look, we're not as, we don't, we're not as smart as the wire.  Okay.  When, when, when our cops show up, just, just put your hands up and get the handcuffs on.  Forget about the chase scene.  Forget about the rights and all that.  Just get arrested.  But I can get out of here.  Unless you put a patrolman right outside, I'm going to run.  And they were like, yeah, no, we're not, you know, we're not doing it. 
[02:24:00]  Just move on.  We have to get to the lawyer part of the show.  Yeah.  But yeah.  People are bitching because we started this show late.  But the reason is we were, we forgot we had another show to do.  We're just hanging out with these guys in the hall.  Yeah.  Just like fucking chit-chatting.  We have a job to do.  Just chit-chatting.  Like, oh yeah, we have somewhere to go.  Shit.  Yeah.  We got people that pay for subscriptions and we're just like, yeah, fuck it.  Put it in replay for a few minutes.  We're chatting.  We're chatting with like guys we admire.  It's actually going to be hard for you.  For you because like Tristan, like you're, you're, you, you played a guy who just became 
[02:24:30]  bad and started shooting people.  Yeah, yeah.  It's got to probably be hard.  You won't be as typecast, I think, because you are so defined as, as like a drug addict,  man.  It's, it's like, uh, it's going to be hard.  Are you going to be typecast with me?  I'll tell you why he's not.  Cause like he, he looks completely different.  You know what I mean?  Like he's all cleaned up and has a different look than what you're used to from the wire.  I do.  But you know, I mean the, the rule of thumb in the movie and television entertainment  is you're only as good as your last role.  Exactly.  And the weird part is, you know, I like to take credit and, and really understand that. 
[02:25:00]  Yes, I played this character that was very, very difficult, very hard, but we all  did.  You know, Tristan, Tristan is not a killer, you know, Snoop is, you know, everybody are  not doing things that they used to do when they're acting.  And, uh, you know, for, for people outside, when they see me, the first thing they're,  they're excited to have my teeth, you know, they're like, you got their own teeth and  your skin looks so good.  I mean, it's a, it's a compliment to my, my, my job as Bubbles, but yes, you know, the 
[02:25:30]  first, after the first season, the first fucking scripts I got was cocaine.  Methane, ecstasy, you know, you know, the, the, the business, they don't really gamble  as much as they should, or, you know, they, they bet on sure things.  Sure.  If they know you play a good junkie, they're not going to offer you the cop role.  They're not going to offer you a lawyer.  Exactly.  They do this, they do the same thing with me, like, all the time.  I'm like, I, I can't tell you how many scripts I've gotten or how many people ask me, oh, 
[02:26:00]  uh, why don't you play this gangster in this TV show?  I mean, you play such a good gangster on the wire.  Why don't, why don't you come over here and shoot a couple of people for us?  I'm like, I'm like, come on.  Like, I want to be, you want to try something else out, right?  I want to be, I want to be something else.  You can't tell how many scripts you've gotten.  I can tell you how many I've gotten.  None.  I've gotten none.  Could you play a fucking anything?  I've gotten none.  If I audition like the rest of them shithead, I get nothing.  Basically what Jimmy's saying, he'll play a pervert for a hundred different people.  Yeah.  A hundred different shows, I mean. 
[02:26:30]  Yeah, I'll never get a script for, as a real actor, man.  I admire real actors.  It's fucking, uh.  I don't know, you were a real actor.  You did a great job in your show.  I don't, you know.  They said just basically be a douchebag, which was kind of easy.  Kind of him.  Just be a me.  And no stretch there.  We, comments typically are fucking awful.  We had one of our comedian friends, Rich Voss.  Oh, good, yeah.  And Chaz Palminteri comes in and does the show sometimes.  And we had Voss surprisingly do a scene.  I just watched it on YouTube last night.  Or on a radio.  And it's just great to watch your friend attempt to act with a real actor. 
[02:27:00]  And he was awful.  He was even worse than I thought.  Oh, he was.  He was.  He was.  He was.  He was.  He was.  He was.  He was.  He was.  He was.  He was.  These guys would appreciate it.  So we tell Rich, because he keeps telling us how he auditions and he's not that good  of an actor and he gets nervous and stuff.  So we set up a scene where he would just read with Jimmy from A Bronx Tale.  Right.  But he doesn't know that we got Chaz right outside the door.  Oh, man.  And all of a sudden, at the last second, Jimmy does the old switcheroo and Chaz walks in to do Jimmy's  role.  This guy, Rich Voss, I don't know if you know him, just pretty much shit his pants  like, holy fuck, you guys suck. 
[02:27:30]  I read with Chaz one time.  I did a table read.  It wasn't an audition.  It was just a table read.  And I was, fuck, you've never seen worse acting.  I mean, I was so nervous and bad.  It was like, it was like me, but I couldn't even be me.  I was just horrendous.  I had to do three different roles.  So I was like, if I'm nervous reading off a script, Voss is going to be petrified standing  there.  So it's very intimidating.  It is.  I experienced, you know, when they come up, I mean, I'm an actor.  I did a little theater.  I was doing like big parts here and there on my way.  My first studio film was Shaft. 
[02:28:00]  And I booked a job and I was happy.  And I walked in and Sam Jackson is, you know, he's sitting there.  And it had to be the worst, my worst experience of my life because, you know, I'm Cuban and  I couldn't get my accent right to save my life.  I was so nervous.  And my accent sounded like I was French.  My father and my whole Spanish side of the family just ostracized me and said, you're a disgrace to the family.  You sound like a nervous Frenchman. 
[02:28:30]  Oh, you're Cuban for real?  I'm Cuban for real.  You know, but you couldn't tell.  And that, you couldn't tell in that movie because I was just, it was just the experience of just  walking on the set, just feeling the bigness of the movie for the, of a movie for the first time shook me out my pants.  How was Sam Jackson?  Great.  Great.  I mean, he's just real natural, real cool.  Like, what you're so nervous about, man?  You're making, you're making money.  Just act, dog.  Just act.  And it just, you just don't believe it's that simple.  All of a sudden, when you look at him and, you know, think about his path and his career, it was just, you know, 
[02:29:00]  that was one of the great things about The Wire first season.  And when everybody came for the first table read, there was no big star.  Like, you just recognize cats from auditions or cats walking around, maybe a movie here or there.  But everybody was just like, you know, what up, what up?  You think this show's going to make it?  I don't know, man.  This is a pilot.  You got paid, right?  Whatever it makes it or not.  At least we got our check.  You know, let's move on.  And I think we saw the first episode together and we didn't think the show was going to make it.  We thought it was just a bunch of talking heads, real slow.  We didn't believe that the audience was going to really accept a cop show that was stressed out, you know, 
[02:29:30]  for one case, 13 episodes.  Yeah, no kidding.  You know, I thought they were so used to the whole hour remedy of it being over in an hour  that it has them sit there and really, you know, watch that kind of a pace slow down that slow.  We thought they were going to, you know, cancel us.  Speaking of which, you were saying some interesting things about the Omar character.  Like everybody wanted to be Omar.  Yes, I mean, you know, Omar, I mean, fuck. 
[02:30:00]  Playing a gay guy on TV, you get nervous.  You think about typecasting.  Right.  You know, so a gay guy on TV, you're not going to work at all unless you play gay.  You know, and, you know, Michael K. Williams, you know, I knew him from Brooklyn, a great actor.  And he jumped on board and I was like, you know, how do you feel about playing this character?  You know, first thing, of course, is I got a job.  You know, I got a job.  I'm going to do the best I can do.  Whatever happens after that is whatever.  I'll deal with it when it comes.  But, you know, he was nervous. 
[02:30:30]  And then I think, you know, David Simon and Ed Burns, the way they introduced the character was brilliant.  Because when he first came out, he was just shotgun, trench coat, blasting everybody.  And I remember when the episodes started showing, I walk around, all my boys, everybody's like,  yo, Omar's the toughest dude on this show.  That's my man.  I'm Omar.  I would do the same thing.  And then the fourth episode when he tongue-kissed his man, I walk around like, yo, you Omar, right?  That's you, right?  And they were like, I didn't know about that, man.  Nah, nah. 
[02:31:00]  But it was too late.  You already committed and said, you know, you was in love with Omar.  So you had to really accept, you know, everything about him and realize.  Just everyone going around, man, I wish I was Omar.  Tough guy.  You know, they all just dropped their jaw like, oh my God, it can't be.  Why did they do that to him?  It can't be.  Hey, did they tell him that they were going to make him gay?  How great is that if, like, they give him this fucking great role and then in season  four, there's a typo in here.  It says I kiss him.  Do I kill him?  Is this kill?  It just can't be fucking kiss. 
[02:31:30]  Nah, they told him.  They told him.  I mean, they were, it's just, when I first got the audition for The Wire and they told  me they wanted me to come in and audition for a junkie named Bubbles, I didn't want to  do it.  I thought it was like Pookie.  I thought it was like, you know, Huggy Bear.  Not that they weren't great characters, but I just felt like I don't want to play into  that stereotypical role of being this cliche comic relief.  And I think a lot of actors felt, you know, when you met David Simon and Ed Burns and our  first producer who passed away, Bob's Colesberry, when you met them and they talked about the 
[02:32:00]  show, you kind of realized that they were taking a different approach, that you were not,  you know, you were not going to be playing just a one-dimensional character.  And I think all actors just fell in love with that.  Yeah.  You know, they fell in love with the opportunity to really play a three-dimensional character.  Where's the red hat?  You know, they got retired.  They got retired.  Do you have it, though?  Back to the world.  Do you have it?  I don't.  I had it and we had like a big fundraiser.  The Ella Thompson.  Ella Thompson's the fund. 
[02:32:30]  Yeah.  And we auctioned it off.  Did they sell the hat?  They sold the hat.  How should the red hat go for?  I don't even remember.  That was a big thing in season one for the people that aren't, you know, totally down with it.  It went from the red hat to the goddamn shopping cart.  All of a sudden, that was my signature.  Wait, you used the red hat in the fourth season also, right?  I used the red hat.  For Bodian and Lil' Kevin, right?  Lil' Kevin, that's right.  It came back.  It came back.  I mean, the red hat.  You know, again, you know, for the first season when Bubbles is trying to identify the bad guys or the cops, he put the red hat on. 
[02:33:00]  Because the cops are on the roof watching and he's going, whoever I put the red hat on.  That's the main dog.  He's the fucking main guy in the crew.  Yeah, take it back.  You know, I laughed at it.  I thought it was crazy.  But then talking to Ed Burns, who knew the real life Bubbles, Bubbles was his CI.  Everything was true.  Everything that Bubbles does on the show is something that Bubbles did in real life.  Oh, did you ever meet the real Bubbles?  I didn't meet him.  He had passed away before I got cast.  But, you know, it was amazing because they said that, you know, the real Bubbles was like 6'4", 200 pounds, like a big dude. 
[02:33:30]  And when I auditioned, they were like, you know, you don't have the physical, you know, look of Bubbles, but you have the essence.  And you're doing a great job.  So they cast me.  And, you know, later on, I wonder what the essence was of a junkie that I had.  I was peening for a job.  And, you know, I brought that into the room.  Came into the room scratching some glass.  I can't go back home to my lady, bro. 
[02:34:00]  I throw the subtitles on, by the way, for The Wire.  Yeah, really?  Oh, yeah.  It makes it way more interesting because I just think you guys are messing up words and stuff.  And like, no, damn, they're speaking a crazy language here.  Yeah, Baltimore slang, yeah.  Baltimore slang and just that youth.  You know, we take the Amtrak down to Washington, D.C. every once in a while.  And it goes right through the heart of, like, that area of Baltimore.  Oh, yeah.  Wow.  Have you guys walked around there?  Yeah.  I mean, we shoot right on location. 
[02:34:30]  Like, when we say we shoot right on location, like, people actually invite us in their house  to have chicken and potato salad with them.  Yeah.  Like, we're right on location.  Like, everything you see on the show is everywhere we're at.  Yeah, we drive on the train to just pray that they don't stop and those doors open.  I'm not even joking because it's like, wow.  It looks like it's just abandoned streets, but you see the satellite dishes and a car here  and there, and you're like, people are really living this life, living in this area. 
[02:35:00]  The first time I heard about the wiring in Baltimore, I've been down there to do the  improv, which is no longer there, and it's in the Inner Harbor.  So you think, oh, it's this nice little Inner Harbor area, and then you're like, oh, yeah,  there's more to Baltimore than a little friendly Inner Harbor with a little seafood.  Have a crab salad, would you?  Yeah, Baltimore, I remember the first time, you know, I'm from the Bronx, and you get  this attitude of, I know any kind of, I've been around any kind of neighborhood, I'll  adapt, I'm cool with it, and I went to Baltimore, and the first day of shooting, you know, we 
[02:35:30]  went into actual, you know, projects with all these trailers and all the cops and all  this attention.  Drug dealers was pissed off.  They were shooting in the air, like, yo, you're bringing too much fucking attention  in my business, dog, get the fuck out of here, what's the wire, what is that, what are you  guys doing?  And they shot in the air, and it was definitely a relationship that we had to get with the  city.  They were shooting in the air while you were filming?  Yeah, they were like, yo, just get out, man. 
[02:36:00]  I heard one story from Bodie, J.D. Williams, he told me that there was this one scene, I  mean, I think you want to tell me this.  The one scene, it was Marlowe's people versus Avon's people, and it was just a big shootout,  they was all shooting down the street.  They told me that, actually, like, when the gunshots stopped, they were like, alright,  we don't, like, our guns are stopped shooting, why is everybody, why are there still gunshots?  And there were people, like, really down the block, really shooting back, because they 
[02:36:30]  thought they were getting shot at.  So, it was just a big gunfight, and everybody's like, alright, get down, get down, these are  real gunshots!  Oh, wow.  Is that when a little kid got shot?  When a little girl got shot?  Yeah, that's it.  Or a little boy?  Mm-hmm.  Wow.  Well, these were really uncomfortable.  I think it was one of the season opening, uh, it's, I learned, uh, more spoilers in  the last 15 minutes.  Yeah.  And then, like, I go from the other place to here, and I decide I gotta go to the bathroom,  I'm in a stall, and I'm still getting spoilers. 
[02:37:00]  Master Poe walks in and gives another one, I'm like, are you, I'm not even safe in the  stall from the wire spoilers.  Yeah, Master Poe is our, uh, is the guy outside.  Our trained killer.  Yeah, he's kind of got, like, Omar's coat.  Yeah, see, he looks very scary.  And Omar's lifestyle.  Yeah.  He's our, uh, he's our security guy.  He's our, he's a, he's a, he's a, he's a major problem.  He's a, he's a, a, really a murderous guy if he fights.  Yeah.  And, uh, he was, like, a little kid when I walked in. 
[02:37:30]  Why is my favorite show?  And then he starts talking to me about a scene that I discussed with Tristan, and I'm like,  well, you're listening to the interview?  We covered that.  You fucking loaded.  Yeah.  So I'm surprised he didn't.  Did he hassle you guys on the way you had for pictures or any of that stuff?  No.  No.  He gets too excited to actually listen.  He gets excited that we have certain people on our show, but he doesn't, he, the excitement  is at a level where he doesn't actually listen to the people he's excited  about being on our show, if that makes sense.  ADD.  Yeah.  Tristan, are you related to Jay-Z?  What's up with that?  I know you're in a, well, I gotta bring it up. 
[02:38:00]  I know you're in a Jay-Z, uh.  Yeah, yeah, I'm in Jay-Z's video, um, Rock Boys, but, um, nah, I'm not really related  to Jay.  Okay.  He's like an uncle to me, but he's not really related.  It's coming in a lot, so I just had to ask.  You guys, you just know him pretty well.  Yeah.  It's not a bad guy to know, right?  Yeah.  Not a bad guy at all.  How much ass I have?  Since the fucking, I mean, you're a married man.  I'm married, man.  I mean, I don't, I don't even, I can't, I'm not even allowed to watch Jay-Z videos.  It's just all alone.  I hurt myself. 
[02:38:30]  I hurt myself.  So, uh, you're, you're, you're, he's 19 years old, Tristan, and you, um, you'll be  20 in July.  I know a lot about you.  No, no, no.  I'll be 19 in July.  Oh, you're only 19?  Yes.  Oh, well, somebody should be 19 in July.  I'll be 19 in July.  I'll be 18.  July what?  I'll be 18 right now.  July 15th.  Okay.  I'm almost excited because I'm July 19th, so I figured we have something in common.  I'm July 17th.  Yeah.  Kansas in the house.  That's crazy now.  Very weird.  You know how it is.  All three actors of a similar ilk.  Yes.  You know, men of the HBO family.  That's right.  Um, so it's got, do you have a girlfriend or are you out just anything that fucking walks? 
[02:39:00]  No, I'm not, I'm not boning anything that walks right now, but no, I don't got a girlfriend.  Okay, so let me rephrase that.  Anything that's not fat that walks.  You have a bonafide part in a hit show and especially the Jay-Z video, which will probably  get you more ass.  Because I imagine like a lot of chicks with big tits are not watching The Wire as much  as fucking 40 year old fucking mediocre men like myself.  I saw the fucking chicks are going to come from the Jay-Z videos.  Um, I don't like to discuss politics at the dinner table. 
[02:39:30]  Ah, there you go.  Very godfather of you.  Very smart.  Very smart.  How'd you get into acting?  Would you get through school or just like?  Yeah, actually it was through school, you know, I was doing a whole lot of school plays  and stuff.  I saw my brother, my brother, my brother, he started acting first.  He was on a couple things, you know, a little bit of TV shows.  He was on a movie, Bullet.  But, um...  Wait, was that with, uh, Mickey Rourke?  Yes.  It was on Tupac, yeah.  Tupac. 
[02:40:00]  And actually that was Michael K's first movie.  Oh, really?  Yep.  It was the first movie.  It was Tupac's brother or sidekick or whatever.  It was his brother.  It was his brother.  Oh, okay.  So, um, so after I seen that, I decided I wanted to start getting into it too.  So, you know, I did everything I had to do.  There was a talent search and right on 42nd Street and thank God they picked me.  He was in a movie that got great reviews.  Not a lot of people saw, unfortunately.  Half Nelson.  Yeah, Half Nelson.  That was one of his first major roles, right? 
[02:40:30]  Mm-hmm.  It was...  A great movie.  Yeah, that was fantastic.  Ryan Gosling.  It was no joke.  Yeah.  Ryan Gosling.  He...  When I tell you, he killed that role, man.  Like, he...  What's the movie about for the people out there?  Just a quick...  For the people out there, he...  You know, he's...  Ryan Gosling plays a teacher in a middle school who's, you know, struggling with a drug habit.  And he befriends this little girl who's getting, like, who's getting pulled into the drug game.  Well, see, she catches him getting high.  Yeah, she catches him getting high.  It's a weird...  It's a weird thing how they become friends, but they become real, real cool at the end. 
[02:41:00]  And, you know, I don't want to talk too much about people.  An urban take on Miss Crabtree.  You know, a different look at a teacher's student relationship, you know.  And he's getting high in the locker room or something, and she happened to be in there  or whatever and catches him.  And now she knows a dirty little secret, and he's, like, this teacher that everyone just  adores.  Yeah.  And then she's getting, yeah, pulled into the drug trade, like he was saying.  It's a really good movie, man.  And isn't it funny, like, when you look at racial differences, like, you mentioned Bullet, 
[02:41:30]  and I go, it does start Mickey Rourke?  And they go, Tupac.  Yeah, right?  I actually, I don't even think I've seen the movie.  I just remember it.  I was ready to say Steve McQueen.  Oh, wow, that's true.  I'll be at Black, White, and Old.  I gotta ask you guys, too.  Before you came in today, I was talking about Maury Levy, the lawyer.  Yeah.  Is this Maury his first name? 
[02:42:00]  I think so, right?  Or Levy?  I know Levy.  The white lawyer.  The Jewish lawyer there that's getting all the guys off.  Maury Levy.  Jesus.  Is he like that in real life?  Because I was telling Jimmy, if he actually came in for an interview, I would probably  jump up and try to strangle him.  I don't like him.  No, no.  I hate that guy.  Real sweet dude.  Really?  Yeah.  So all spoken.  And just like, when they yell cut, he'll be like, I don't know, was that a good scene?  Yeah.  Was it all right?  Did I do okay?  Really?  Yeah.  Wow.  He's such a prick, man.  Isn't he Nina's? 
[02:42:30]  He's one of the producers' brother.  He's close.  All right.  Well, he's close to the family.  But he's a great dude, man.  Great man.  Just great.  His character's great, because I hate him more than anyone on TV.  Yeah, he really is a fucking swarthy dude.  Oh, that's a great scene, too.  In that Omar scene in court, when Omar calls him out, because he's all profiting on the  drug trade.  Yeah.  That's a great scene in that court scene.  We're talking about it a lot.  I got a shotgun.  You got a briefcase.  Yes.  We're doing the same thing, yeah.  What is the worst tie ever put on television? 
[02:43:00]  He's wearing, in that scene, the fucking worst tie.  You, too.  And I know you don't want to buy the DVDs, but if you want to just watch scenes from the  wire, like if you want to watch this great scene, of course you don't, because you haven't  seen it, where Tristan fucking blasts Snoop.  I mean, I saw it, and I wound up going online when I was by my computer just watching that  scene again and again.  And it was such a weird gentleness in this murder.  I mean, that's what's so good about it, whereas The Sopranos was so fucking great, but The Sopranos 
[02:43:30]  never moved me.  I was telling that these guys, like, you know, I never cried watching The Sopranos.  Not that I ever did watching your show.  You didn't get a little watery eye when they dragged Adriana in the woods?  That was the first time.  Absolutely.  When they grabbed her out of the woods, I got a little watery eye.  That was brutal, man.  No, only because you didn't fuck her.  I was like, I have to see her naked once.  No, I didn't.  I'll tell you what made me, the times I got misty-eyed in the wire.  When Omar got shot, I'm not going to lie, I fucking was very depressed.  And there's a scene that you have in a rehab, which was fucking, it was only a moment. 
[02:44:00]  It was like at the end, they always end well.  It was fucking horribly depressing.  I'm like, ugh, why do I like this show?  You're like, shit, I'm just sad that I want to curl up and hug somebody.  The writing has been fantastic.  The first season I watched, I read the whole script.  I was invested into what's going on.  And after the first season, I said, you know what?  I'm just going to read my parts because I love sitting in front of the TV 
[02:44:30]  and watching everybody else and see what they're going to do.  And it's a chance of being part of the show and being a fan at the same time.  And there's just certain scenes where I just was like, when Keem McGregs got shot  and saw how everybody else reacted, I almost broke down in tears.  There's so many moments where Randy, when he's yelling at Seth,  you're going to look out for me?  You're going to stand up for me?  And just seeing his, I mean, it was just, there's certain moments that you just, 
[02:45:00]  you know, you look at it and you just get, you get dragged into the reality  that there are people out there who lived this life.  Yeah.  Who, this is the choices that they were, they were given.  And, you know, it turned out badly.  You ever want to go to the creator and go, come on, a couple more years.  What the hell are you doing here?  Come on, we're doing good.  We got a nice year.  Come on, help me out.  I don't because, you know, five years of a junkie is enough.  You know, I'm ready to get cleaned up.  I'm ready to stay clean.  But, you know, David Simon, he's a novel writer, man.  And from day one, they saw it in a five-season arc. 
[02:45:30]  Yeah.  And he's very happy that, you know, everybody started catching on.  But to him, you know, it loses its potent if he drags it on.  If he just says, okay, I'm just doing it for, you know, because the audience wants it,  it's not hitting his point.  He wants to get it, tell it, and then say, you think about it.  You know, you put that book on the shelf, and then whenever you want to go back to it,  you take it on the shelf.  It's out there, yeah.  Well, by killing off Omar, he admitted that he did that in a way like he's like,  and it wasn't some hipper-than-the-room shit. 
[02:46:00]  He was like, this is an angry show.  This is not necessarily about giving you the big shootout you want or whatever.  It was just very realistic that they did that.  And as much as I hated it, to me, it's like it cemented the integrity.  It's like that should, I didn't want that to happen, but it kind of had to.  You know, so there's no chance.  It's like killing Henry Blake after fucking, uh...  Oh, right.  First season.  Mass.  Yeah.  Fuck him.  Well, we got to take a break, and we should get you guys out of here.  We really appreciate you coming home for another segment.  Yeah, hell yeah, man. 
[02:46:30]  Thank you very, very much.  Anytime, man.  Anytime.  Are both of you guys in the finale?  You gotta watch.  All right.  Fair enough.  I'll spoil it, they are, because they were both in the one before the finale.  So if all of a sudden they weren't there, it would just seem really weird.  What happened to Mike and Bubz?  How they just went on vacation together.  Contractual issues.  They're in fucking St. Bart's.  While everybody else gets shot in Baltimore.  They're on a gay cruise.  Exactly.  They felt so bad about Omar.  They celebrated. 
[02:47:00]  We had a dance.  We had a dance.  Yeah, whatever.  I was going to go with the gay cruise a little longer, but the series finale is this Sunday  night on HBO at 9 o'clock.  And you said it's an extended one?  Yes, sir.  An hour and a half.  Oh, excellent.  So, you know, if you're a fan of the show, if you're not a fan of the show, go out and  get the DVDs.  I know we spoiled.  Absolutely.  I think you're going to watch Sunday and then just save 30 hours of viewing time.  You'll have to watch up to that.  When I watched The Sopranos, I knew Big Pussy Got Killed before I ever saw an episode, 
[02:47:30]  and I still love this character.  Oh, thanks.  You know, I haven't seen one episode.  No, I think it's better, though, at this point, if you haven't seen any of The Y.  Because now, like, I'll watch it, because I'll watch all the box sets, and I won't know  who the hell you've been talking about, which will be kind of cool.  There you go.  And I hope he's watched enough where he knows the names, and it's going to be like, he's  just going, ah, shit.  Ah, fuck.  Although, to me, Tristan is, like, just a stranger.  Like, you could be, like, any dude in the studio right now, and then his part's going 
[02:48:00]  to pop up and go, god damn it.  That guy was in the studio.  Son of a bitch.  And he really pissed off.  And he's such a sweet boy when he first comes on.  He's so nice and pleasant and eager to learn some boxing.  And then what a fucking murderous motherfucker he comes into.  But he's been smiling the whole time, so I assume that smile turns into a pretty serious  look, right?  It's great, yeah.  So it's a really, really hard, not a bad guy, but just a guy who becomes a killer and 
[02:48:30]  is comfortable being a killer.  It's really a great transformation.  And I should have said that, because I know you from Hef Nelson.  You did a fine job, so.  Fine job.  Thank you.  Well, thank you for having us.  All right, guys.  Thank you so much.  Thanks for coming in, guys.  Cool.  Definitely.  Very cool.  Thanks for listening for us.  I appreciate it.  We'll continue in just a bit.  I'm throwing up some gang signs.  Come on.  Come on.  Do it.  Do it with me.  West side.  West side.  Come on.  Pulling down some dead presidents, yo.  West side.  West side. 
[02:49:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony.  Are you ready?  Are you ready?  On the way over to XM today, I had to stop and take a duty break, because I had something  a-brewing.  And where do you guys stand on the whole, a lot of work with not much of a result shit? 
[02:49:30]  It's not fun.  You ever, like, really work out a nugget, and you really think you're getting something  done?  And you look in the toilet, and it's like a fucking, it's like a fucking jawbreaker.  Yes.  And it turns out that it is.  And you're like, all this work to get this thing out?  What happened?  I really was expecting, like, a huge, like, fucking black snake.  A big log.  Like a bow or something, and you got a little, like, gumball. 
[02:50:00]  I like our shit talk segments here.  Well, it's frustrating.  Can't do them over there, you know.  Well, what's, so.  What is that all about?  Uh, I don't know.  The nugget?  Yeah, but it feels like, but it feels like you're getting something done.  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah, that is frustrating.  Well, a lot of times they say, like, it's just, uh.  Jizz in your store.  God damn it.  That's exactly where I was going before.  It's about time I beat you to one.  The tides are finally changing.  He beat him to the punch. 
[02:50:30]  Like, and Jimmy beats me to the shit I want to say.  It's so funny.  He beat me to a load in the ass.  I know.  Boy.  That's funny, though.  This is breaking news, and then I got something that could be interesting, or could be who gives  a shit.  But, uh, I emptied another box in my apartment overnight, and, uh, I brought in and made  a lot of people laugh, especially these, uh, newbies.  Not that they're newbies, because they've been around a while.  Because you got, uh.  I actually brought in a box of carts.  And half the guys that work for the O.P. and Anthony show looked at them like, what? 
[02:51:00]  What is that strange thing?  I looked at them and went, wow, I remember those.  Yeah.  Like, I remember the labels on them and everything.  Yeah.  And E-Rock goes, do you want these back?  I'm like, I don't have a cart machine in my apartment.  He's got a cart machine.  But they're legendary, because they're the actual carts of bits and music beds and stuff  that a lot of the hardcore fans remember, like, yesterday.  We should maybe just sign the carts and hand them out to people that come in and check  out the show on the bleachers.  You know what you should do, though, first? 
[02:51:30]  Where are they?  Where are the carts?  Are they here?  You should stack them up and, like, fiddle around.  And people will remember hearing that on the radio.  Oh, okay.  Because remember when you used to hear carts?  You don't hear it anymore.  It's just something you don't hear in the background of radio anymore.  Yeah.  You hear, like, CDs and stuff.  But carts made, I remember growing up listening to radio, carts made such a distinct sound  on the air.  I think the famous cart scene is, didn't Howard knock over a bunch of carts? 
[02:52:00]  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  Carts, and they fell onto the turntable in private parts.  Do we have that, Cliff?  Yeah.  This one.  I gotta say, that movie did have a couple of funny moments.  This was one of them.  Yeah, that's carts.  That's the sound of carts falling. 
[02:52:30]  Why was he panicking like that?  I only saw it years ago.  The turntable, the music was on the turntable.  It was an old turntable thing, and the carts fell right onto the record that was spinning  on them.  He was a nervous mess.  That was the part of the movie where he was just a nervous mess.  That was funny.  So we got this breaking news, and then whatever was on the carts, they put on a nice little  CD for us so we could go down memory lane.  But first this.  Who said there really isn't that significant a difference between you two, and they'd like  to see you both on the ticket? 
[02:53:00]  Well, that may be where this is headed, but of course we have to decide who's on the top  of the ticket.  And I think that the people of Ohio very clearly said that it should be me.  Yeah, Hillary on, I think, Good Morning America, one of those, basically not against the Obama-Hillary ticket or the Hillary-Obama ticket.  That's bad for them.  What they said was that Obama would not take her as a VP, but she would take him.  Probably, like, she would want him as her vice president, but he would not want her. 
[02:53:30]  So hopefully he will win the nomination.  Because, you know, it's common sense.  But look, the country, a black guy or a woman's a huge difference, but to have them both on  the ticket is, you're never going to beat John McCain with that.  At that point, they're probably thinking, eh, why not?  Just, eh, throw him on there, screw it.  This is already crazy, so why don't we make it crazy?  Whatever.  Whatever.  Yeah, but Obama's saying it's premature to talk about a joint ticket.  He's like, shut up.  Yeah, stop. 
[02:54:00]  I'm in the lead of this damn thing, and that's how I want to keep it.  I don't think Obama would take her.  You think he would?  Wait, you think Hillary would take Obama, but not Obama taking Hillary?  Without a doubt, I think that, yeah.  Because I think that...  I think Obama's smart enough to get, like, old white guy.  Yes!  Just to kind of counter the whole old white guy McCain thing.  Isn't that why, like, when they said, like, JFK took Lyndon Johnson?  Because he was, like, I think a Southern Democrat.  I mean, someone else may, obviously, be more versed than I am, but isn't that why?  I don't know.  I'm being boring.  I'm sorry. 
[02:54:30]  How funny would it be if Obama makes a secret deal and has Bill Clinton as the vice president?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, would that be a boot in her cunt?  Oh, man.  What do you got there?  Jesus.  Way to put it, morning, Joe.  Well, it would be.  I was just thinking if we were going to have president...  Or vice president...  It's all up in the air right now.  I guess we'll see.  Why don't you do that bit while we had two fine actors in the studio? 
[02:55:00]  Yeah, exactly.  Well, I...  Exactly.  Yeah, I think.  Instead, you just sat there...  Not funny!  That's why.  And sipped on your smoothie.  Not funny!  Hey, is that jazz bag pipe up again or no?  Who knows?  Who knows?  No one listens to him.  Except the pests now.  They're listening to him.  No, they love him.  Torturing the shit out of him.  It's hilarious.  Not funny!  I'm reading the...  I'm a fat Jew!  Hey, you got me!  I'm definitely reading the threads on it because they're having so much fun with that dope 
[02:55:30]  up there.  Yeah.  It's so funny watching...  Like, when someone's kicking the dog shit out of you to watch him try to empower himself  by...  Oh, I know.  It's like, eh, not working.  Hey, uh...  All right, so I brought in a box of carts and we could easily be throwing ourselves under  the old bus because I have no idea.  I see a lot of these things and I think they're all good stuff, but I don't know.  I really don't know.  So you want to just listen to them?  Could this be painful again or is this going to be...  By the way, I finally unearthed the box of Real Rock TV VHS tapes. 
[02:56:00]  Those will be coming soon.  And I also gave a box of tapes to Sam and he found the time we gave away the shit car  in Boston.  The news report.  Okay, good.  I'm hoping we have that ready for tomorrow.  If Sam's listening, I'm hoping.  It's the news report of a really bad promotion we did in Boston.  I think the first time we got negative publicity.  And I think I also have the, uh...  Spudz Bookly?  The report on WOW that they did up there. 
[02:56:30]  Oh, yeah, that scumbag.  With the fucking asshole that came in with an earring like he's the coolest dude in the  world.  Hey, guys, this is great.  Show us a little something.  Yeah.  He was trying to, like, uh...  He's all dressed down, like, t-shirt and jeans and stuff.  And he had the camera crew and the mic and he's, like, getting sound bites.  And we were all caught up in the moment because we were stupid and didn't know that the  news was a bunch of fucking scumbags.  And, uh...  We're just telling them how cool tits are.  We were offering them way too much.  A lot of info.  And these girls are barely legal. 
[02:57:00]  Oh, it's fantastic.  And people drive and you almost crash your fucking car because you're, like, looking at  tits.  Let us tell you how rock and roll we are.  We're secretly hoping one of these dopes crashes because they don't give us more publicity.  Yeah.  Just being completely eager assholes, not having a clue what the news was all about.  And then here comes airtime.  Here comes airtime for the news.  All of a sudden, his earring is gone.  He's in a suit and tie, standing on the side of the road going, the danger of a promotion 
[02:57:30]  from a radio station.  It's like, wait, where's the guy with the t-shirt that was laughing with us?  And basically, he's like, and here are the dopes that are responsible for this.  I gotta find that.  Fucking scumbag.  He was all hanging out with us.  Yeah, he was pretty much drinking beers with us.  Flirting with the girls that were in studio that day.  I remember bringing a girl down on my shoulders and they were videotaping it.  Remember that? 
[02:58:00]  We took some girl and we were in the elevator and she got on my shoulders as we walked out  because it was going to look cool for the news if I had some topless chick on my shoulders.  So we walk out and the news is like, yeah, that's great.  Oh, meanwhile, we just got crucified.  This was 96.  I remember we were onto something because people started hanging out in this parking lot  in Westboro, Massachusetts, in the middle of fucking nowhere.  Yeah.  And they would drink beers.  Remember there was a bus, like a party bus, and they're on top of the bus just cranking out 
[02:58:30]  the fucking show.  And we're in an office park where there's regular Joes going to work and everyone hated  us.  And all of a sudden it became like this Grateful Dead thing.  People just started hanging out in the parking lot, checking out the show and picking up chicks  and stuff.  Just drinking.  Because the loose women would come and they would just be flashing every guy and girl  going in and out of the building that had regular jobs.  I'm like, God damn, I think we got something here.  Amazing.  Anyway, so I brought in some old carts and let's see what we got.  We start with this. 
[02:59:00]  Oh, boy.  Hopefully Sam will have that news report by tomorrow.  Both of those news reports for tomorrow would be great.  Check down memory lane.  Holy loose lips.  Holy conversations.  Hi, this is Burt Ward Robin.  If you want the best in big talk and small talk, listen to Opie and Anthony on WAAF 107.3,  the only station that really rocks.  That was Robin from the Batman series.  That was in a box in my apartment. 
[02:59:30]  I've been carrying that around for 10, 12 fucking years.  Why?  If you need something really big, just look under my underpants.  Yeah, apparently.  There's a fat cock buried under two pairs.  I know what that was about.  When celebrities started doing IDs for our show and just mentioning our name, I thought  that was the coolest thing, so I had to save all that.  Now it's like, ah, whatever.  Yeah, go fucking say our names in the studio somewhere.  But I saved the actual cart.  Here's Burt Ward, man. 
[03:00:00]  That is cool, though, to have, man.  I think that's fucking cool to have.  But you know what?  I'm giving them away.  We'll sign them and just give them to whoever.  If you want a cart, come check out the show tomorrow.  That's right.  And if not, don't.  There you go.  And then, of course, we've been looking for this for years.  I think it's just a music bed, but it'll bring back some memories.  Whoa.  Damn you.  Charlton Heston's bed.  Oh, wait.  I got an actual one. 
[03:00:30]  Is it an actual?  I got an actual one, man.  Charlton Heston bed?  Oh, wow.  Okay.  This is when we first came back to New York.  It's Anthony doing Charlton Heston traffic.  Ah, yes.  Used to do Charlton Heston traffic.  Ew.  Hey, it was fun.  Why is it okay?  No.  Okay.  Keep that music, though, because we needed that one day, right?  Yes.  Yeah, I got the actual.  I think this is just the bed right here.  My cold, dead hands. 
[03:01:00]  That's just the bed, yeah.  That'll be just the bed, but this is what Anthony did with it, which, I mean, people at  any W that walked the halls loved this bit.  Charlton Heston traffic.  Charlton Heston traffic.  Damn you all.  Damn.  Damn all.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Damn you.  Damn traffic. 
[03:01:30]  Lord almighty, why?  I am begged of thee to no avail.  Your children continue to suffer.  Why have you abandoned them, God?  Damn you.  Is it not enough they slave through the day?  Why have your merciful hands not touched upon them, God?  Damn.  Damn.  Damn.  My eyes are pained as I behold the journey of tears that is the FDR drive.  Have they not suffered enough, God? 
[03:02:00]  Damn you.  They are massed together as are the stones of the Great Pyramid, not a space between them  to breathe.  Why, God?  Damn.  Damn, Lord.  Can you not hear them?  The sorrowful wails that they're stranded in the darkness of the Lincoln Tunnel?  Doth the murky waters block their cries from your ears, God?  Damn you.  Why do you test their faith so?  Do thine eyes deceive me, rubbernecking on the outbound Queensborough Bridge? 
[03:02:30]  God, no.  Why?  What pleasure doth one receive stealing a fleeting glance at a fallen brother, only to torture  those who follow you?  There but for the grace of God.  Damn you.  Sinners.  Sinners.  I said, cast my staff across these waters and lead my flock home.  Follow me in the name of God Almighty. 
[03:03:00]  Follow.  Damn you.  Damn you all.  Damn you all.  Damn you.  Holy shit, we used to write for this show.  Oh, Christ.  Remember when we used to write?  I remember that.  Was that actually writing stupid now?  Produced?  Yeah, there was a little bit of production there.  Wow.  It actually meant staying after the show for a few minutes.  Yeah.  For a couple of minutes. 
[03:03:30]  Let's go to Howard in DC.  Howard?  Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh,  Boo, boo.  So why is it the fact that if there's ever a black entertainer or black, like, music or something  we're listening to  that Andy shuts up.  He hasn't said a word  to Anthony's attack.  What happened?  Yeah, you're awfully quiet  when we interview black guys.  No, no, not at all.  Is it the racism?  Unfortunately,  yeah, I'm very racist.  No, unfortunately,  I don't know anything 
[03:04:00]  about the show.  I wish I did,  but I don't.  I didn't watch it.  That's like me  watching you  interview the Lost Guys.  The Lost Guys, yeah.  That's what I said  when I went in  to do some production  with Tim,  I go,  so that's what it looks like  when you watch people  interview people  from a show  that you've never seen before.  Yeah, yeah.  Okay, because I had no clue.  I admit it,  I was a chatty...  You are a chatty...  What do you guys think 
[03:04:30]  of the Charlton Heston traffic?  It's good.  Of course.  Not bad, right?  This next one  I carry with me.  This next one goes back to...  I acquired this  when I was doing a show  for BAB.  Ah.  Playing some of the carts  that I found in a box  in my apartment.  Another box unemptied.  Still got about 10 of these  to go, by the way.  This bit will last for,  I don't know,  who knows,  a few more months. 
[03:05:00]  Oh, no.  I remember this.  Oh, God.  I'm the man.  And it makes the cart  sound of a broken cart.  Well, they've been trying  to transfer these  all morning long.  They're like,  man, these carts  are in bad shape.  Yeah.  Condom man,  condom man,  does whatever  a condom can.  Fits a richer  than any size.  When you rise,  condomize.  Look out.  Here comes  the condom man. 
[03:05:30]  Pregnancy  and disease.  These are both  his enemies.  He is strong.  Oh, my God.  He can hold  an eight-ounce pot.  Hey, there.  There goes  the condom man.  In the heat  of the night,  when she's about  to blow your mind,  this latex superhero  will arrive  just in time.  Condom man,  condom man,  friendly neighborhood  condom man. 
[03:06:00]  Most of the time,  he's ignored.  Action is  his reward to him.  Whenever there's  a hang-up,  wherever someone's hung,  you'll find  the condom man.  What do you think,  Jimmy?  I like it a lot.  A little condom man thing.  The wad line was my favorite.  The what?  The wad line.  The wad line.  Yee-me.  Yee-me.  I was a chatty yee-me.  Yee-me.  Yee-me.  Is this boring,  people, you think? 
[03:06:30]  It's the old school stuff.  They don't know  what they're going to hear.  It's just a box of carts  that I found  and brought in today.  God, am I a fat cunt?  This next one,  I have no idea  what it is.  This is the first one  I have no idea  what we're going to hear.  It could be  Douche Chili.  I have no clue.  It's labeled  Cry Baby.  Cry Baby.  Let me think.  Oh, fuck.  Cry Baby.  Anyone?  We should play  Guess What This Is.  Yeah,  Guess What This Is.  Cry Baby.  We got a lot of  It's Cry Baby? 
[03:07:00]  It says Cry Baby  on the cart.  42 seconds.  Played it a lot.  Enough that I  saved it in a box  for many years.  Cry Baby.  Cry Baby.  Someone's saying,  holy crap,  you guys were hacks.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And this is coming in a lot.  Pretty hacky.  They're now typing this.  Someone's saying  this is an off day for us.  I do not think  that is true.  Shit it.  All right,  here is Cry Baby. 
[03:07:30]  Oh,  it's just a Cry Baby.  Oh,  we used to play that  when someone on the phone  would start like  giving us shit  or crying  or whining.  Yeah,  not all of these  are going to be gems.  This is what we had handy  when we were talking  about Howard.  All right,  okay.  Fair is fair.  We would just play this  in the background  and then read how  we were just,  I don't know,  whatever.  We're going to have  to play the whole thing.  No shit.  That is disturbing. 
[03:08:00]  That's all right,  don't be so upset.  I'm showing you  how to be an adult.  Oh,  God.  Come here.  I got some  sardine oil  for you.  Sardine oil.  Kids love  sardine oil.  Yeah. 
[03:08:30]  Have some cotton candy  for Brevcus.  They're such a creep.  You want a  dark place  you kiss?  All right,  bit over,  bit over.  All right,  so far,  so far,  we're not  minding any gold  here.  What?  What happened?  Oh,  okay.  What do you  whisper?  Here's the next  cart.  Box of carts  found,  brought them in  to see what  these are all  about.  And here we go.  I remember this 
[03:09:00]  one.  Darth Vulgar,  everyone.  That was  Darth Vulgar?  Yeah,  Darth Vulgar.  Jesus,  we were  hacks.  Maybe he cursed.  Huh?  Maybe he cursed.  Well,  I remember this bit.  We got in trouble  because the bleeps  weren't good enough.  Oh,  is that it?  Yeah.  Yeah.  A little too close  on the bleeps  for back in the  day.  I am Darth Vulgar.  Defy me and  get a boot up  your ass.  Ah,  Princess Leia,  buff my helmet. 
[03:09:30]  R2D2,  shut up,  you overgrown  butt plug.  I am Darth  Vulgar.  Luke,  I am your  father.  Your mother  was the worst  I ever had.  If she gave  good head,  you wouldn't  even be here.  I didn't even  bleep.  When she dropped  her pants,  it looked like  she had a  Wookiee in  a leg lock.  Lando,  Carissa,  we meet again.  Shouldn't you  be sitting  in the back  of the ship,  you f***? 
[03:10:00]  And you,  Jabba the Hutt,  you fat bastard.  You can't even  see your dick  anymore,  can you?  I am  Darth Vulgar.  Yoda,  make like a  gerbil and crawl  upon Solo's  a**.  You look like  a scrotum  with ears.  my balls  are as big  as the Death  Star.  Obi-Wan,  you limp  to go f***.  You can't  even get it  up anymore.  He played that?  I am Darth  Vulgar,  mother f***er 
[03:10:30]  of the universe.  I think that's,  that got played  on regular radio.  I think that's  more fun for us  because,  holy shit.  There was a time  that wasn't any  beef.  But there was  a time in radio  just to bring  inside a little  bit where  that's all  they asked  for was to  bleep the word  a little bit.  So just the  slightest bleep  made it FCC  friendly.  And then somewhere  along the line  you had to bleep  out the entire  word.  You couldn't  use the,  you couldn't  use the,  the bleep  becomes part  of the word. 
[03:11:00]  Right.  It's like,  f***.  Yeah.  But that was  legal.  Yeah.  That wasn't even  us taking chances.  I remember that  was actually legal.  And then I  remember when it  came down,  look,  now you got to  bleep the entire  word.  And I remember  you and I  were just so  hours like,  come on,  what the f***?  That's bullshit,  man.  Man.  Man.  It's the man  coming down  on his man.  Well,  the reviews  are coming in.  Tim from Columbus,  Ohio writes,  hmm,  it's good.  I mean,  it's no bra  bomb or anything,  but it's okay.  This is really 
[03:11:30]  old stuff.  I like Darth  Vulgar,  though.  Darth Vulgar?  Who wouldn't?  Yeah.  Ew.  Ew.  Ew.  Boo.  G-Baby saying,  bring back  Darth Vulgar.  Oh,  yeah.  Can you bring  back Darth  Vulgar?  Darth Vulgar rules.  No.  Darth Vulgar is  dead.  Why?  Because.  Someone's like,  way to go,  way to bleep  those yous.  Blue Heeler  from Kentucky.  Yeah,  I know.  That is fucking  funny,  man,  because.  Motherfucker  of the universe.  Basically, 
[03:12:00]  motherfucker  without a radio.  Motherfucker.  You want the  next one?  You bet I do.  This one's really  hacky,  because you see,  my name's Opie,  so I would  collect like,  Opie bits.  Oh,  no.  Oh,  no.  Yeah.  Hey,  hey,  hey,  hey.  All right,  moving on to the  next one.  Hey,  no,  you got to play  that.  What the fuck  was that?  Come on,  play that.  By the way,  I don't know if 
[03:12:30]  this guy is fucking  with me,  but someone  who's in the  know,  by the way,  it's not just  some listener  that's fucking  with us,  swears that  he's in  possession  of four  Spuds  Buckley  bits.  Wow.  Where is he?  Where is this  mystery man?  Come on.  He wrote me.  He's going to end  up dead  by Opie's hands.  He wrote me,  and I didn't even  acknowledge that  I got his email.  What's his  email address?  I don't remember.  We can email him.  I'm so nervous,  man.  That will be the 
[03:13:00]  end of this  dumb-looking-back-on-the-good-old-days  bit.  All right,  here we go.  So remember,  Opie,  so I'm collecting  Opie bits.  In an alley behind  Main Street,  rockin' and rollin',  he pulls the rope  and starts the pullin'.  There's blood in his eyes  as he starts on his spree  to dismember 
[03:13:30]  the town of Mayberry.  Over on Elm,  Delmaloo's in the kitchen,  got her needle  and thread out  to do some stitching.  A knock on the back door.  Who could that be?  As she hears the sound  of her destiny.  The Mayberry Chainsaw Massacre,  I wonder who the killer  could be.  The Mayberry Chainsaw Massacre,  in Mayberry R.F.D.  Gomer and Goober 
[03:14:00]  at the fill-in station,  about to get themselves  an education.  Gomer's pumping gas,  Goober's on a cam,  when all of a sudden...  Shazam!  Boo!  Surprise!  Surprise!  Buddy's car gets a flat  in the rain.  Back in the trunk,  our hero oils his chain.  As he pops the latch  with a spare in the jack,  he finds his next  for a big hack attack.  The Mayberry Chainsaw Massacre,  I wonder who the killer  could be.  The Mayberry Chainsaw Massacre, 
[03:14:30]  in Mayberry R.F.D.  Boring!  Opie's at home,  so was Aunt Bea.  Wondering who the  Chainsaw Killer could be.  They hear a knock.  Hey, maybe it's Paul.  But as they turn to look,  they both get the...  Boo!  And he's at the barbershop,  opens the door,  finds a bid more  than they bargained for.  As he sits in the chair,  and he sits with a grin. 
[03:15:00]  Glad you could...  Shut up!  The Mayberry Chainsaw Massacre,  I wonder who the killer could be.  At the Mayberry Chainsaw Massacre,  in Mayberry R.F.D.  Is anybody living on the last?  The Mayberry Chainsaw Massacre,  I wonder who the killer could be.  At the Mayberry Chainsaw Massacre,  in Mayberry R.F.D.  The Mayberry Chainsaw Massacre,  Kyle S. from Indiana.  Wow.  How did you ever get this one  on regular radio?  Boo!  Boo! 
[03:15:30]  That is awful.  Can I introduce you in a haircut?  All right.  We get it.  How is you a killer?  Florida Steve from Washington, D.C.  writes,  Holy Casio Keyboard Pit, Batman.  Wait, where'd it go?  Fuck.  Is this from a radio comedy pit service?  Yeah, that one actually was.  Oof.  Prep Burger?  Yeah, I think it was Prep Burger.  It's a...  Shut up. 
[03:16:00]  Can I interest you in a haircut?  He means with the chainsaw.  Right.  Sure, if you cut this bit first.  And opiananthony.com,  we have a section called  Old School Opian Anthony.  Later today,  we'll put these up  without us fucking around with them.  Sure.  Hey, Bob Kelly, how...  What the hell is this?  Are you auditioning  for the Blues Brothers movie?  Are you fucking going to court?  What are you doing?  I was hoping he winds up  like Belushi.  What do you got?  I, uh...  So he's got some VHS tapes.  And you're looking skinny,  by the way.  Oh, Bobby. 
[03:16:30]  Hi, how you guys doing?  You're very handsome.  Hey.  I just wanted to, uh,  drop these off.  Uh-oh.  And the reason why  I'm dressed like this  is probably because  after I give you these,  I'm probably going to have  to get a day job.  Oh, no.  So I figured I would...  I would actually start  getting used to wearing  a suit and tie.  Oh, this is gold.  And shaving and showering  in the morning.  I'm sure this is gold.  I have three tapes.  The first one,  not so bad.  This is me as a VJ,  like an MTV VJ,  on the Burley Band Network, 
[03:17:00]  which was a college network,  only pumped into colleges.  Oh, no.  My first month  in New York City.  Very good-looking,  young Bob Kelly.  All right.  Very bad.  I'll take that one home.  Wow.  People are getting  into this old-school bit, man.  I love it.  I have number two.  Yeah.  These are the two  first movies I ever did.  Last Night at Eddie's  and The Koala Bear Kid.  Ew.  The Koala Bear Kid?  It's actually,  if you see the movie,  you'll understand the name. 
[03:17:30]  Okay.  What does Koala Bear  mean douchebag?  The Koala Bear Kid  actually has a cameo performance  by a good friend of the show,  Billy Burr,  who looks like  a red-headed Mexican in this.  And the second one  is actually  I Am the Romantic Lead.  Oh.  My name is Dylan.  In The Koala Bear Kid, Bob?  No, in The Last Night at Eddie's,  I Am the Romantic Lead.  I have very long hair.  Very young Bob Kelly.  Very gorgeous. 
[03:18:00]  Very sexy.  And one of my lines  at the end is,  I love you, Allison.  I always have.  Very bad.  And this third one,  it took me all night  to actually decide  to give this thing.  Deal on!  Deal on!  I actually,  I swear to God,  I prayed on this one.  Yeah.  Because I didn't know  if I should give you guys  because this is the one  you've been waiting for.  Oh, yeah.  This by far,  my wife,  who loves me,  who loves me to death,  who is biased, 
[03:18:30]  you know,  couldn't watch this last night.  Couldn't watch this.  Wow.  What was it?  You said from the cellar Saturday?  Oh, yeah, Jim.  Oh, for offenses.  I was waiting for any one of you guys  to hit something on the park.  This one is,  this is a tape from me  in Boston  back in the day.  Very good looking Bob Kelly. 
[03:19:00]  Very good looking Bob Kelly.  Very cute.  But a very untalented Bob Kelly.  And this is probably the worst.  I couldn't even watch this.  This,  this sent  douche shivers up my spine.  What is it?  Exactly.  This is me  doing stand-up.  With Dane Cook.  Please say.  Not Alan the Monkees?  I,  well,  I have Alan the Monkees.  Uh-huh.  I do have Alan the Monkees.  This is worse?  This is worse than Alan the Monkees  because  of  the,  the crowd work  that I do in this, 
[03:19:30]  the,  the,  so wanting to be liked  and my Boston accent in this  is so atrocious.  There's certain things I do in this  that,  to get a laugh  and actually get a laugh  that are,  I,  I just can't believe I did it.  Tell me one.  I,  instead of,  I don't know what this,  why I did this,  but instead of,  uh,  saying something funny,  sometimes I just scream  to get my point across  and then I'd go  Why would you do that? 
[03:20:00]  Don't do that even here now.  No,  you wouldn't.  I would go,  she's nuts.  I could relate.  I had a boo-boo-boo thing  that I used to do.  Oof.  Oof.  Oof.  So this one is very,  this is very bad.  This is going to come back  to haunt me.  How about this?  First of all,  yes,  you're not doing this Friday.  Come God.  Yeah,  you,  you have to come in tomorrow now.  Yeah,  you definitely have to do this.  You just got your invite  for tomorrow's show.  You're not.  You can't do this  with Jimmy's idea.  You're not. 
[03:20:30]  Sneaking this shit  on the air  while I'm in fucking Atlanta.  Listen,  I think Friday  is a great day to do it.  No,  it's not.  Listen,  hang on for a second.  No,  I think Friday  is a great day  because listen,  Friday,  it's going to be me,  you,  and aunt,  and I think that'd be  a lot of fun.  Oh,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no.  These things,  these things,  with these tapes,  the more the merrier.  You fucking,  trying to sell tickets.  She's crazy. 
[03:21:00]  Were you hoping  that was going to be  your thing?  When you walked out  on stage,  the whole audience  would be like,  here comes the  whole other guy.  That was going to be  my Sufi.  I'd walk on stage  at Madison Square Garden  in front of 18,000 people.  Just hear them all  going,  I'd walk out and go,  what's up,  motherfuckers?  And I'd hear,  oh,  you know,  Bobby,  I was just thinking  of something.  I know you're going  to be at  Helium Comedy Club  down there in Philly  starting tonight,  right?  Actually,  we have Wednesday. 
[03:21:30]  Oh,  starting tomorrow night?  No,  tonight,  Wednesday,  Thursday,  Friday,  and Saturday.  I would imagine  when you're there  for the next few days,  I don't think  there will be a lot  of people actually  doing a  as you walk out  onto the stage.  Do we have anything  that can hook a VCR up  to our,  we can't just watch  this now for like a minute.  We can't get a minute  of this now.  Danny,  we got anything?  Can we transfer this?  We need a  We can transfer it,  definitely,  but I mean,  if you guys want to  watch it right now,  I don't know.  No,  no,  not watch,  well,  if you just get a clip. 
[03:22:00]  I just like a minute,  can we just get like  a minute of it?  Just be careful  with this gem,  Danny.  Yeah.  Just get it on  disc for us.  Tommy,  you can't come in  tomorrow?  No,  I actually switched  all my radio  to Thursday tomorrow.  All right,  so what we'll do  is there's no way  we're doing this Friday.  No.  No.  Just hear me out.  How about you come in  Monday to tell us  how great the shows  were in Philly?  I have to.  I think we should,  I think we should know  because that will give you  time to get like  other people in here.  We got a real busy  show for Friday.  You know,  I'm with Jimmy.  We're going to have  to wait on this one. 
[03:22:30]  But Friday,  listen,  the guys are going to  need time to go  through the tapes.  I'm thinking Monday  or Tuesday.  The only reason why  is because I had  many,  I had many laughs  on your stupid  hot air balloon show.  Right,  right.  It was very funny  and I had many laughs  on him rubbing  his dumb head  and on his stupid  stand-up.  But this by far  trumps anything  stupid you guys have done.  You really do understand  that you're not  doing this Friday.  Of course it's terrible. 
[03:23:00]  This is terrible.  This is...  So please,  because Bobby  doesn't want to be  distracted.  Do you understand  that you're actually  making this  actually my sofa?  Don't do that  at helium.  It'd be distracting.  When he walks out.  He'll feel like an asshole.  He certainly will.  When he walks out.  Yeah.  If he walks out  like he's an older man now  and you all just go...  No, no,  you're mixing it up  with yours.  What's the...  Yours is...  Mine is... 
[03:23:30]  It's a little different.  There it is.  Why scallop?  I don't know.  That's what I used to do.  Why?  What?  How would the hand go?  Show the hand.  Show the hand.  Oh, that is stupid.  Really?  I wouldn't do that.  We're trying to trump  each other with awfulness.  So if we get that  on the air,  the...  I will finally bring in  a boo-boo-boo  for everybody. 
[03:24:00]  Wow.  That's brave.  I ended every phone call  back in the day  with a boo-boo-boo.  A boo-boo-boo.  Something like that.  That Jimmy did.  Something like that.  And then I was...  It followed me everywhere.  I would do bar gigs  and people would go...  A boo-boo-boo.  How did you do that?  How did that start?  I don't know.  How does anything become that?  I don't know.  It started out with...  I was doing a hacky thing.  After every phone call,  I would go...  See ya!  And then somehow  it morphed into  a boo-boo-boo. 
[03:24:30]  Like...  Oh, there it is.  There it is, folks.  But anyway.  A boo-boo-boo.  So we'll do this next week, Bobby.  We gotta...  We gotta get hurting my chest.  I think you should...  I think you should do it Friday.  No, it's not happening.  Because guess who won't be here Friday?  You're not gonna be here?  Yes, guess who won't.  Why?  Just call in.  I'll be away.  Do a call in.  The callers are always good.  Can I just tell you something  about that yimmy?  Yeah, what? 
[03:25:00]  What, Bobby?  I can't stop saying it.  Really?  And in the stupid  Call of Duty 4 thing,  that's all...  Every time we win a game,  everybody goes,  yimmy, yimmy, yimmy, yimmy, yimmy.  I can't stop saying it.  You didn't get the hand motions down.  What?  Yimmy.  I can't stop doing it.  I want to fucking have a pet.  A yimmy pet.  A yimmy pet.  I want a yimmy.  That animation's hilarious, though, isn't it?  The Puppet Show?  Dude, it's got...  Fat Bob Kelly is one of my favorites, though. 
[03:25:30]  I can't stop.  I can't stop doing yimmy.  Wait till we do our real animation festival.  We're still getting the details together,  but it's going to rock sometime in May.  Going to sell out a joint  with hopefully a very cheap ticket for everybody.  All right, Bobby,  hand those tapes over  because we got to finish up with this crap.  Wait a minute.  You're not playing it right now.  No.  I want to hear one moment of it.  We're trying,  but I think those guys are meeting.  They got a really important meeting  they're doing right now.  Wait a minute,  because I'm not leaving this fucking studio  if that's going to play.  One minute of it.  I don't know what minute they have.  Yeah, let's try it.  Just one minute.  All right.  Because I want... 
[03:26:00]  All right, hand those over, Bobby.  We're in the middle  of playing these old carts I found in a book.  Oh, shit.  Yeah, yeah.  Bobby, speaking of you bringing in old shit,  I brought in old shit today.  What'd you bring in?  It was a bunch of carts.  We would put really good bits...  What's a cart?  Exactly.  It's an old thing  that you used to put sounds on  and bits on.  Oh, you mean like the 8-tracks?  Yeah.  Yeah, it looks like an 8-track.  It sort of looks like an 8-track.  And I would put really special stuff  from the radio show,  whether it was me by myself  or me and Ant at NAW or AAF  on these carts  because I'm like, 
[03:26:30]  these are the important things  that we need handy  to play for everybody.  And I brought in a box of these things  and you might as well sit down  and just have fun  because it's just awful.  I've been told that  the John Boy and Billy show,  syndicated through the South,  are currently playing Condom Man  and a duplicate version  called Married Man.  Really?  You want to hear the next one?  Yes, please.  All right.  Here we go.  Hi, boys and girls,  and welcome to another edition  of Stone... 
[03:27:00]  Huh?  Oh, what were you doing?  What are you doing?  Was he not just  like tapping on the bar?  Yeah, what did you do?  What's up?  Stop whispering to microphone.  Why are you giving me these?  What?  Oh, you did ask for those cards.  Oh, no, that's...  The moment passed.  All right.  Six hours ago.  Yeah.  It was yesterday.  Here's the next card  that was brought in  in that box.  Hi, boys and girls,  and welcome to another edition  of Stoner Spelling Bee.  Today's contestant is Old Dirty.  Old Dirty,  your word is inebriated. 
[03:27:30]  Inubriated.  Yeah, let's hear this one.  E-N-U-B-R-I-T-E-T.  Am I good?  Inubriated.  Inubri...  R-A-T-E-T.  Yeah.  Inubriated.  Inubriated.  Yeah.  E-N-B-R-I-T-E-T-E-T.  Yeah.  That was right, yo.  Okay, Old Dirty,  since you're from the hood,  use inebriated in a sentence, 
[03:28:00]  and then try and spell it.  All right,  use inubriated in a sentence.  Right.  Every time I go to the studio,  I get inubriated.  Okay, now spell.  E-N-U-I-N-U-B-I-T-E.  Yeah, man.  Oh, my God.  Inubriated.  Inubriated.  B-R-E-A-T-E-T.  That's it, man.  I don't know it, man.  Anyway, I know what it feels like.  I don't know what it feels like.  How to spell it.  And that's my word. 
[03:28:30]  Inubriated.  It's I-N-E-B-R-I-A-T-E-T.  So easy.  So it doesn't sound like inubriated when you spell it.  See you next time,  and thanks for playing.  Inubriated.  Not that bad, actually.  Nah.  Rumor has it that Patrick Swayze has five weeks to live.  He has pancreatic cancer.  What?  And he literally has five weeks to live.  We were just talking about him the other day.  No way. 
[03:29:00]  Breaking news.  Swayze.  Gino, who's usually pretty good, reliable.  He says,  Patrick Swayze has pancreatic cancer.  Five weeks left to live, apparently.  NationalEnquirer.com has the story.  I just watched it.  We just watched The Outsiders.  How old is he?  He's not that old.  Once you get that pancreatic...  Yeah, but he's got that...  He's an alcoholic, too.  And he's got that...  He turned quick.  Like, in a year, he turned into, like, my uncle.  Who?  Patrick Swayze.  Really?  He was from molesting people? 
[03:29:30]  Oh, shit.  Not swim walk.  I remember that, actually.  No, it comes suddenly.  It comes suddenly.  You gotta ask somebody their name.  Yo, what's your name, man?  That fucking animation should have won the whole thing, man.  I fucking love it.  But who am I?  This is the fucking curse of the movie Roadhouse.  Yeah.  Here it is. 
[03:30:00]  First, Jeff Healy.  Now, Patrick Swayze's gonna drop off.  And then, who's next?  I don't know if there was anyone else in that movie.  Dude, he has terminal cancer of the pancreas.  Four weeks ago, his doctors gave him five weeks to live.  Four weeks ago, they gave him five weeks?  Boy, if we could only get him on the phone.  Yeah, we better start.  It's Patrick Swayze.  Can we book that interview, you think, Steve?  Try?  Yeah.  Wow, that's a drag.  You guys wanna hear another one from the carts, or should we move on?  Disappeared?  One more? 
[03:30:30]  Well, this is a bit that a lot of old-timers talk about.  We used to tape ourselves on the way into Manhattan when Ant and I were driving.  Oh, yeah.  And I do believe this is one of those tapes, or a best-of tape.  We edited a bunch of the audio together.  That's sad.  What, the best-of or Patrick Swayze?  Patrick Swayze.  So it's real, huh?  Oh, yeah.  Fucking-  Yes. 
[03:31:00]  It's real.  Yes.  Huh?  Press release.  Press release and everything?  Yes.  He's 55 years old.  He's been sick with the disease since he was diagnosed in late January with pancreatic cancer.  Cancer has since spread to other organs.  Late January?  I'm sorry, dude.  Jesus.  End of February.  There is nothing worse than that pancreatic.  Where's the pancreatic?  Dead sentence.  It kind of hangs out near your liver.  That's the one you don't come back from for the most part.  How do you know if you have it?  Dead sentence.  Huh?  I don't want pancreatic cancer.  The doctor tells you you've got five weeks to live.  That's how you know you have it.  Do you pee a lot? 
[03:31:30]  You pee a lot?  I wouldn't want it.  But I have for you.  How about it?  What does it do?  Do you pee a lot?  Constantly.  Hmm.  Why are you dressed like that?  I did this.  Answer the question.  I would assume with the pancreas you'd probably get symptoms of diabetes, maybe.  Diabetes.  Are you piss, honey?  I would think.  Are you doing a men in black thing or what?  Why are you dressed like that?  I dress like this.  To bring in tapes?  No way.  To bring in tapes.  Looks like the main character in the game Hitman.  What is this? 
[03:32:00]  Only if he ate.  Yeah, there you go.  Oh, you got it?  Instead of killing people, he's going to eat people.  He ate the people instead of shot them.  It's shit, man.  All right.  Listen.  Shit, man.  We are.  Hi, Jimmy.  We are done with the carts until tomorrow.  Oh, thank God.  Tomorrow we'll do Road Rage, Scared Shitless Project, and a few other ditties from the carts  I brought in today.  All right.  Enough of that for today, because we got the first two minutes of Bob Kelly sex.  Oh, God.  What is Bob Kelly sex? 
[03:32:30]  Sex.  Seth.  It's a sex.  A T can look like an X if it's turned a little sideways.  You have a retard right.  Sex.  That's sex.  Thank you.  Let me see.  Yeah.  I even got to agree with him on that one.  Bob Kelly sex.  That's sex.  You don't like agreeing with me?  What's up with that shit?  Yeah.  Oh, shit.  There we go.  What's your name?  All right.  Here's Bob Kelly.  What year is this, Bobby?  This has to be...  What'd you say?  Nothing.  By the way, use lead bag rights.  Holy crap.  Steve is reading the same article I'm looking at. 
[03:33:00]  It's like having a faggot in your brain.  From Steve C.  This is when I...  This is...  Oh.  What the fuck?  Spanking noises.  I actually remember that.  I remember that.  You're not as far away from that as you think.  Oh.  What year is this, Bobby?  This had to be...  We got to get out of here.  Right after the Al and the Monkeys broke up. 
[03:33:30]  So...  This is a robbery...  It had to be 96, 95.  All right.  Somewhere around there.  Good enough.  Our next performer, ladies and gentlemen, is a dear friend of mine and a very, very funny  young man.  He's a winner of the...  Former winner of the WBCN Comedy Riot right here in Boston.  Also a finalist from our big...  Right.  ...NBC Tonight Show contest that went on to the Nationals.  He's the one.  He's the only.  Bobby Kelly!  Bobby! 
[03:34:00]  Kelly!  Kelly!  I hate you already.  Bobby Kelly!  This is so bad.  What's up?  What's going on?  How you guys doing?  Good.  Hey!  How you guys doing?  Cool.  Cool.  Welcome to, uh, Saugus.  Isn't that like a wicked quick name for a town, though?  Saugus.  He's not really cool and come from his town, either.  He's like, my name's Frank Neal, and I work a construction worker, and, uh, I come from  Saugus. 
[03:34:30]  I like Sanatoga Springwater.  Saugus.  Do you see Gus?  Do you see Gus?  I saw Gus.  He saw Gus.  Saugus.  Oh, no.  You didn't just say you saw Gus in Saugus.  Ugh.  All right.  I saw Gut, and I just walked out.  Oh, there he goes.  Oh.  What are you going to go, pee on your body, in Peabody? 
[03:35:00]  Peabody?  Exactly.  You're going to go tell yourself to do something, which would be boss a ton.  In a few minutes, you're going to be able to see Gut in Pizza Hut.  Where did he go?  Where is he?  You got to see him in these tapes, too.  He had all of his hair.  He was in shape.  Like, he actually looked, like, really good.  That's how I met him.  He was a stud when I met him.  Saug Gus.  That would be known when Bob Kelly was a stud when I met him.  And the Boston accent. 
[03:35:30]  Wow.  You saw Gus?  You see Gus?  I saw Gus.  I saw Gus in Saugus.  Too bad there's not a town called Get Killed.  Fucking asshole.  And he does the same bit kind of recently with Massachusetts with the, how it sounds, girly.  Yeah, Massachusetts.  Massachusetts.  Yeah.  So, sorry, Bob.  Look at him.  Oh, Jesus.  Come on back in here.  I'm not sure if it's an evolution.  It's so difficult, isn't it?  You can, busboy outfit.  Listen to me.  I don't know if I'm real.  He really does look like he's going to cater something later.  I know.  And judging by this, he should be. 
[03:36:00]  Well, this is only a taste.  We've got to get the boys on this.  Sometime next week, we're going to get all the highlights of those video cassettes.  Is there another second on his?  Oh, sure.  Can I ask a question?  Do you have the part where it goes?  No, I wanted to get in here as soon as possible, so I only cut the first two.  What are they casting for?  Reservoir hogs?  Someone is saying, well, he's Mr. Stink.  It would be John in Virginia.  Johnny, what a man. 
[03:36:30]  That's a funny one, man.  Jesus.  John in Virginia writes, this bit is Worcester in Worcester.  Thomas Overbeck from Dallas.  Bob Kelly's a massive two-shits in Massachusetts. 
[03:37:00]  And this is from the first two seconds of this.  Dude, let me tell you something.  I watched this last night and said, this is what they've been waiting for.  This is the gold.  This is what they've been waiting for.  Yeah, why do you wait for fucking 5-11?  Listen, Matt Lamb from New York City.  The quality of the audio is terrible, thank God, because actually hearing it clearly would  be worse than pancreatic cancer.  No one puts baby in the coffin.  Oh, shit.  Oh, no.  I had the time of my short life. 
[03:37:30]  But I see the end of my life.  Oh, that's horrible.  I won't even see spring training.  Oh, terrible.  You know, at least he could look at the good news.  What's that?  Doesn't have to pay his taxes.  I hope he does it April 16th.  Oh, that's sad.  Hey, wait.  Oh, we have another second.  Just another taste of it.  Oh, yeah.  A little Bob Kelly.  I was having a limp here. 
[03:38:00]  Just another little touch.  Just another one of these.  Oh, but another one of these.  Just a little something.  Yeah.  A little something to nibble on.  Just a little something for the palate.  Yeah.  We're going to do this justice next week, Bobby.  You understand.  Oh, this is great.  You guys go through it nice and slowly and just bring up the best of the best.  I'm going to Africa next week.  I'm doing Doctors Without Borders next week.  Are people paying to see you?  Like, honestly, I couldn't think of the worst.  I'm just a part of this.  It's a part of this. 
[03:38:30]  I hate Dan's little freaking, like, 45-year-old woman laugh.  Your head is red, Bobby.  You're actually...  All right.  Can you be quiet, Bobby?  He doesn't titter.  It's time to make fun of you as a bitch.  He does.  He does.  It's time to make fun of you as a bitch.  Laughing at a play.  It's not about you.  That's right.  It's about you.  But it's...  Yeah.  I saw it, guys.  I saw it, guys.  Oh, and I improv'd that play.  Did you see him?  Look at the menu. 
[03:39:00]  Order of fucking three.  You guys psyched if the fucking winter's over?  I hate the winter.  I can't stand the freaking winter.  I was in Vermont.  I says, I hate the winter.  They were like, oh, we love the fucking winter.  Stand, stand.  Fuck stand.  I come from Revere.  I don't skate.  I don't skate.  I do is when I slip on my ass going to my car.  Oh.  I can't do this.  Slip on my ass going to my car. 
[03:39:30]  Yeah.  I can't do this.  My car in heaven, yeah.  Come on.  I can't do this.  I can't do this.  Oh, wow.  Skin?  Skin?  Skin.  I'm from Revere.  Slip on my ass going to the car.  All right, fucking Lenny Clark.  Jesus Christ.  I'm like Lenny.  Dude.  Yeah.  At least I grew out of it. 
[03:40:00]  Did you?  Did you?  Out of all your clothes?  Oh, fuck.  I was so eager.  You got a little green.  I did get green.  You got a little excited about that.  I'm sorry, Bobby.  Should have slowed down because that was a good one.  I know.  I like to have Pebbles cereal, you know, Roxbury.  Is Patrick Swayze going to star in the remake of Ghost?  Oh, no. 
[03:40:30]  He finally gets to feel Demi Moore's boobies.  Oh, no.  Can you get the retard singing time in my life?  That's our dedication.  That's what we do for the great Patrick Swayze today.  I shovel.  That's what I do.  I'm from Revere.  I shovel that shit.  I get a shovel.  I'm looking at the freaking...  I think it should be a law.  Anybody who owns a snowblower has to do his whole fucking block.  I'm serious.  Assholes.  I'm out here with a garden weasel making a path this fucking big. 
[03:41:00]  Just enough for my feet to get by so I don't get snow in my shoe.  My grandmother's yelling out the window,  Bobby, what if somebody fat wants to come by?  Make the path bigger.  Like, man, if people don't get fat from the ankles down, they'll go up.  Come on, if you don't get fat from here, you're up.  You never see somebody with big fat fucking feet, you know?  Susan Potter, stop the insanity.  You get fat feet.  Oh, God.  That's actually...  God cursed you with fatness because of your old...  That material's actually not that bad. 
[03:41:30]  That little hunk right there with the shoveling for fat...  It isn't bad.  I kind of like that if someone's got a snowblower,  they should do the whole fucking block.  That was funny.  He said, who you are a shit.  Yeah, I mean, like, I don't get snow in my shoes, you know,  shovel case, fat people come.  That's all right.  Yeah, that wasn't bad.  Squarehead.  Squarehead writes, the queer from Revere.  No, there's gold in them, our hills. 
[03:42:00]  We do have a meeting standing by.  Yeah, we got to go.  So more of this next week, Bobby.  Yes.  Bobby's going to be in Friday for Jimmy because Jimmy's going to be in Atlanta.  Yeah, I got to go to Atlanta to do the Roxy.  And that will be Saturday night.  And Bobby is going to be at Helium Comedy Club in Philly Wednesday through Sunday night?  Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday.  Helium Comedy.  Philly crew needs some tickets.  What do I do?  What do I do?  Give you some names?  Have them just walk up.  There'll be plenty available.  I'm kidding.  Jesus Christ. 
[03:42:30]  Yimmy.  Yimmy.  I was only kidding.  I'll be cute again.  You do want to cage him up and take him home.  I do.  I can't.  In a bird cage.  I want a Yimmy pet that you can't feed after midnight.  Yimmy.  Yimmy.  Give him some chicken after midnight.  He's all mean.  He's not cute.  Doesn't say Yimmy anymore.  I can see an animation done with the Yimmy pet. 
[03:43:00]  Yimmy.  So I got to get tickets from you for the Philly crew.  They want to see you badly.  You want to go to night?  That's the only way he performs.  Jesus Christ, Yimmy.  Wow.  What the fuck are you doing?  Not everybody has a fucking condo, you asshole.  Fucking batting practice over here.  That was a good fucking ticket.  That was very good.  Bobby's hilarious.  That was a great joke.  Yeah.  See him badly.  That is fantastic.  Fucking goddamn asshole.  Fucking turning me into Voss here. 
[03:43:30]  Jesus Christ.  That was a good line.  That was a great line.  That was a wonderful line.  I would suggest you go see Bob.  Yeah, that was really fucking fun.  You used your Lucky Louie acting on that one.  They all know.  They all know you.  I suggest you go see him.  I suggest you go see Bob in the round.  That's the only way you can see me.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  You realize we're just making noises now?  Exactly.  That's what we've been doing since 6.15.  Oh, shit. 
[03:44:00]  Swim walk.  Yes.  I'm going to rework this line, but I guess God is opening up a club.  Oh, he needs a bouncer.  Sure.  Yeah.  Patrick Swayze.  Let's get the lines ready for when it happens.  All right, Bobby.  More of this next week.  All right.  We got to do a line of the day and get out of here.  We got a meeting to get to.  SkiColoradoNow.com for info on great deals on 26 world-class resorts and up to the minute  snow conditions, Bobby.  I don't ski Colorado. 
[03:44:30]  I shovel.  I'm from Revere.  I'm from Revere.  Dawn didn't like that tape.  She couldn't watch it.  The only thing she said, she walked by, she goes, well, at least you're really cute.  And she left.  She couldn't watch it because she's, I don't know, maybe I shouldn't do this to you.  Yeah.  It's so good.  Because now she knows what she's missing.  If you would have just taken care of yourself.  Let me tell you something.  If you watch this, watch the movie. 
[03:45:00]  I hear, you're skinny, you got the hair, you got everything.  Watch the movie.  What movie?  The two movies I gave you.  Okay.  Watch the two movies and watch that clip.  You don't understand how fucking good looking I was.  All right.  I mean, I'm talking fucking movie star.  Movie star Hollywood good looks.  Oh, absolutely.  Someone put that on the other room for a minute.  A clip of fucking Mr. Deluded.  Bobby, I remember meeting you for the first time at the cellar probably about 10 years ago  when we all had our youth. 
[03:45:30]  And I'm like, fuck, this guy is actually better looking than me.  I was a good looking guy.  I was pissed.  Very good looking guy.  Jesus.  And now all your hopes and dreams have worked.  You used your evil powers to make me a fat mess.  I know you lost some weight though.  A little bit.  No, you're on your way, Bobby.  Yeah, well.  You're going to have to get a new wedding ring soon.  That thing's going to fall off your finger.  It's a wedding hula hoop.  It's his old cock ring. 
[03:46:00]  A wedding hula hoop.  Ah, yeah.  All right.  Helium.  Philly.  You're going to get a nice crowd down there.  You didn't really promote the fucking thing.  You forgot to promote it.  Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday.  Do we have promos running at all?  I think so, yeah.  With gay 80s music?  I love that.  I think so.  I'm going to do that.  Ski Colorado.  SkiColoradoNow.com.  Here's a runner-up line of the day.  I like pictures too, but it's like flash, flash, flash.  No.  It's like, oh, he chased Diana to her death a few years ago. 
[03:46:30]  Philly, Philly.  Bobby's going to be silly in Philly.  Oh.  But I'm working it out in my head.  I'm just like going through the process.  Philadelphia.  Oh, Philadelphia.  Oh.  Okay.  Let me think a little longer.  Another runner-up line of the day.  How about a bicycle store called Pedalphilia?  There you go.  That would be a nice one. 
[03:47:00]  Hell yeah.  Gregorio.  Antonio.  Jimbo.  Jimbo.  Hey, Jimbo.  Jimbo.  Hey, Petsu.  Get a little Petsu.  Another runner-up line of the day.  Yeah.  Earl.  Black Earl from the Ron and Fez show.  He says that he's part Cherokee, I think.  Yeah.  Indian.  And Ronnie just nails him on it.  But I guess if you say you have a certain amount of Indian blood in you and go through 
[03:47:30]  some paperwork, you get some of the conveniences of being an Indian in this country.  An American Indian.  Yeah.  Is the leader of that tribe Geronimofo?  Geronimofo?  That was a good one, Jimmy.  That's silly.  Who?  What?  What?  Who are you?  Yes.  Oh, Jay.  Oh, boy. 
[03:48:00]  Hey, Jay, we're packing up here.  How are you, pale?  I know.  I'm never up this early.  Jay Malaw.  I said, oh, my gosh.  I'm up early enough.  I can finally call these guys.  At 11 o'clock.  No, he's out there in L.A., though.  I know.  I was like, oh, my gosh.  I'm finally with all these guys.  And you're packing up.  I'm like, quick.  I know they got this suitcase.  I know you guys have your briefcases.  I'll be going over the last minute files.  Yes, of course.  That was Jay Moore.  I got a pee. 
[03:48:30]  I'm just calling to say...  Jimmy doesn't want to talk to you.  He's making me believe he has to pee.  Oh, Jesus.  What's that about?  There's a problem with you two?  Oh.  I'm just fucking with you.  Jimmy had a pee, so he ran out.  That's all.  Oh.  I was like, what?  I don't have a problem with anybody.  No.  I love everybody, as Buddy Hackett once said.  Well, you've got to love everybody.  And the most important thing is never hold a grudge.  Because while you have a grudge, the other guy's out dancing because he's a prick. 
[03:49:00]  Hey, Jay, breaking news out there in Hollywood.  Patrick Swayze is going to be dead within a week or two.  What happened?  Uh, pancreatic cancer, my friend.  You know, I do, uh...  I hate to be one of these guys.  But there's a pancreatic cancer event every year.  It's called PanCan.  Yeah.  And they have a hard time raising money because no one ever dies from it.  No one ever dies from pancreatic cancer.  It's like, it's not a glamorous, like, breast cancer.  It's like a more glamorous one, you know? 
[03:49:30]  No one ever dies from it.  I believe, uh...  I hear their success rate is 100%, Jay.  Yeah, but...  You mean not enough people get it, or...?  I know with somebody that goes, I have pancreatic cancer, and thanks to PanCan, I lived.  Really?  Because, uh...  Like Pavarotti died of pancreatic cancer.  Yeah, so did, uh...  What's his name there?  Little Joe and, uh, Pa Ingles.  What's his...  Oh, uh, Michael Landon?  Michael Landon.  He had the pancreatic...  I thought he died of abusing his kids. 
[03:50:00]  So, it's all over, it's hell.  We're not gonna have a black president.  Uh, you think Hillary now?  That would've been great.  I mean, he would've had bad credit.  The president would've been late.  State of the Union starts at 8.  At 8.15, America's looking at an empty desk.  He's out in the hallway starting...  Air Force One is lowered.  He drives it to Texas on the freeway. 
[03:50:30]  Gin and juice, laid back.  Jay, who do you...  The Secret Service, the Secret Service all have their own mics.  Jay, who do you want to be president of these United States?  I want Obama.  Yeah, right on, man.  I voted for Obama, and then, you know, I never voted before.  And then you vote, and your guy loses, and you're like,  well, what the heck was that for, then?  I went down to the junior high, scanned the local talent. 
[03:51:00]  I cast my ballot.  And then I go home, and they're like,  Hillary, that's 70% of the vote in California.  And I'm driving around the freeway, like,  what's wrong with everybody else?  You did the right thing.  Well, that's why we don't vote here in New York,  because the Democrats got it no matter what.  The state is already won by the Democrats.  Because of the Jew.  Atta boy, Jay.  The Jew, huh?  Jimmy Norton.  Where's Jimmy performing this week?  I'll be in Atlanta.  I'm doing the Rock Seed Theater.  Hotlanta!  Hotlanta.  That's right.  Oh, swimwalk.  Have you ever noticed Atlanta is one of those places 
[03:51:30]  that's always 14 degrees colder  than you ever thought it could possibly be  when you get there?  I've only been there a couple of times.  I didn't notice it was colder.  But I did notice that it wasn't as  southern Georgia Jimmy Carter as I kind of expected.  It was a little Freak Nick-ish when I got down there.  Freak Nick.  Ron Bennington's favorite thing in the world.  Freak Nick.  Freak Nick.  We lived up Freak Nick.  We got great Freak Nick stories.  That was fun.  Get out of the car. 
[03:52:00]  Jimmy, you ever played the Ontario Improv?  I have not.  Oh, yeah, one time.  I didn't draw shit,  so they probably won't have me back.  Well, yeah, it's because they put it  in the middle of Mexico.  I went to go hit baseballs on a Saturday  and I saw a guy waiting for a bus  wearing a cowboy hat holding a chicken.  They go, we only have three acts a year.  I go, who?  You and Ralphie May.  I go, you only have five.  I blew the joke.  But he actually said,  we only have three white acts a year.  And I said, who?  And he goes, you and Ralphie May. 
[03:52:30]  Oh, that's funny.  All right.  I didn't do that well there,  to be honest with you.  It was great crowds,  but I didn't draw a big audience.  I'm trying to put the theater shows together.  And then,  I do it.  After all the expenses  and after everybody gets paid,  you got to charge the fans  $50 to get in to make any money.  Yeah, you don't make a tremendous amount,  but, you know.  Guess I'll be calling you a lot more often.  As Colin Quinn once said,  Jimmy,  Hodgepodge,  this is my new book  called Hodgepodge. 
[03:53:00]  And I'm wearing a sweater  and it's not Christmas time.  Shut up.  Let me finish.  You go,  you think you're like  this man of the people.  You get out of the club  like you're a blue collar guy.  I got to work out  all my new stuff.  That is fucking great, dude.  Oh, is that fucking Colin?  He's so quick.  Stupid.  That's an impression.  That is fucking Colin, man.  He even has...  Go ahead.  Sorry.  He even has Colin's way of  like pausing. 
[03:53:30]  Like, that is a fucking  great impression, man.  Well, you know,  what can you do?  You don't make up in traffic.  We need to go to preschool.  Don't forget today's crazy hair day.  Crazy hair day.  How's your hair look?  Oh, my God.  Well, I'll see you boys later.  Get ready to pack up  and if this theater thing  comes through,  I'll set my alarm, boys.  Awesome.  Thank you, Jay.  See you, Jay.  Good hearing from you, man.  God bless, boys.  Hey, God bless. 
[03:54:00]  Jay Moore, everyone.  Fucking...  That was...  That's funny.  That might be the favorite thing  I've ever heard him do right now.  That is a great fucking Colin.  He has Colin's...  Yeah, man.  The way Colin  kind of swallow talk...  He has a perfect impression  of that fucking zilch.  People are requesting  it's Tracy Morgan,  but he had to go next time.  I can do Tracy.  As do we.  Tracy Morgan.  See?  I'm good.  I don't like that bird.  He stole my credit card.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You go, what up, bird? 
[03:54:30]  Hey, what up, bird?  Oh, shoot.  Here's another runner-up line  of the day.  My wife, who loves me,  who loves me to death,  who is biased,  you know,  couldn't watch this last night.  Couldn't watch this.  Wow.  What was he?  You said from the cellar Saturday?  Like...  That's Freddy.  Always a wise-ass.  He writes,  Today I learned,  Jay Moore,  important enough  to delay meetings. 
[03:55:00]  XM listeners,  not so much.  Not so much.  Fuck you, man.  Are we done?  Runner-up?  We got it.  Line of the day?  All right.  We got the retard singing  time in my life?  Yep.  All right.  We're going to end...  So this is what we do.  Line of the day,  right into that,  and we'll see you guys tomorrow,  okay?  All right.  Here is your line of the day.  Here comes...  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day. 
[03:55:30]  Sargast.  Do you see Gus?  Do you see Gus?  I saw Gus.  I saw Gus.  Oh, no.  I've had the time of my life.  Now I never felt this way before.  Yes, I swear. 
[03:56:00]  It's the truth.  And I owe it all to you.  Because I've had the time of my life.  I've been waiting for so long.  Now I finally found this one to stay by me.  Yeah, we're riding on the wall. 
[03:56:30]  And you felt the magic called fantasy.  Yeah, I'm passionate in our eyes.  It's a way we couldn't die secretly.  Don't we take each other's hands.  Don't we take each other's hands.  I won't be so many understand.  You're daunting.  Just remember  You're the one 
[03:57:00]  King of all  So I tell you something  This could be love  Because I've had the time of my life  That I never felt that way before  Yes, I swear  It's the truth  That I'm all in you 
[03:57:30]  And my body and soul  Can you know that you never know  Just let it go  Be afraid to lose control  No  Yeah, I know you thought you were mine 
[03:58:00]  Just stay  Stay with me tonight  I can't get enough of  So I'll tell you something  This could be love  Because I've had the time of my life  No, I never felt that way before 
[03:58:30]  But I can't get enough of  Because I've had the time of my life  And I've had the time of my life  And I've had the time of my life  And I've had the time of my life  And God, that I've found  And my love  Is my only  And I only  Thank you. 
[03:59:00]  Thank you. 
[03:59:30]  Thank you. 
[04:00:00]  Thank you. 
[04:00:30]  Thank you. </pre>
