<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with "That's Not My Name" by The Ting Tings, sparking a discussion about the band, their appearance on Jimmy Fallon, and the lead singer's attractiveness.  They reminisced about other Fallon guests, including Bill Paxton (whom they wished they'd had on their show) and the Kardashians (who also declined their invitation).  The difficulty of booking guests and common excuses, such as not being a morning person, were highlighted.

Opie then shared a story about a boozy St. Patrick's Day that led to him falling asleep during an Apple product presentation.  The hosts transitioned to celebrating their recent successful live broadcast, giving credit to their production team, Voss and Colin, and noting the surprisingly large and diverse audience, including many women.

Jim Norton joined the show with a prepared intro.  The hosts also interacted with recurring callers "Stalker Patty" and "Bobo," with Bobo's encounter with Colin Quinn proving particularly humorous.  A lengthy, funny anecdote detailed Anthony's attempt at a "Platoon" bit which was hilariously derailed by Bobo's unscripted commentary.  The conversation then shifted to Jim Norton's recent appearance on Jay Leno, where he pushed the envelope with his jokes.

The show returned to the successful live broadcast and the burgeoning popularity of satellite radio, contrasting it with the decline of edgy talk radio on FM. They discussed improvements in satellite radio technology and accessibility.  Frustrations with the iPhone's early picture messaging system and its eventual improvement were also aired.  The final segment featured David Lee Roth, who was in-studio, reviewing his interns.  This part included playful ribbing between the hosts and Roth regarding his attire and persona.  The show concluded with a mention of the death of Natasha Richardson.

[00:08:30]  Wow.  We got you a Ting Ting ID there, Anthony.  God damn, that rocks.  I think E-Rock's looking out for you.  It might be E-Rock.  It might be E-Rock.  That's very cool.  Ting Tings are doing their little thing.  We try to get them in here, but they don't want anything to do with us.  Even though that ID makes it sound like they do.  It certainly does, but no, huh?  You want to come in?  That's not her name.  That's not her name.  That's not her name. 
[00:09:00]  The Ting Tings.  We actually, there were some tickets laying around for the Jimmy Fallon taping yesterday, so we all went.  What the hell?  Yeah.  And the Ting Tings performed.  They were great.  She's a little weird looking, but I don't know.  I was telling you before we went on the air.  I'm trying to figure out if she's hot or not.  When you see a broad, you're like, is she hot or not?  It's the first thing guys do, right?  And you got to kind of work this one out in your head?  I don't know if she's hot.  I think she's hot because she's got youth on her side. 
[00:09:30]  She knows how to dress.  Kind of sexy, but it's like 80s sexy.  Like that whole 80s sexy look is coming back.  Yeah.  She's a singer.  Like she's into the new wave slash modern music.  I mean, I don't know what the hell's going on.  You know, a retro but new kind of thing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know.  But I haven't seen many pictures of her.  And like you said, the video, it's such quick clips of her.  And that usually spells disaster. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah, absolutely.  You know, that's like, well, we don't want to keep her on camera too long.  Get it just enough where you can go, is she?  Well, she's gone now.  You know what it comes down to?  These guys that put all that crap together.  If the woman is really hot, you're not going to change the camera angle because the guy  in charge of the camera angle is just going to be like, oh, God.  Yeah.  Oh, oh, oh.  I got to get another shot going on.  Yeah.  But if she's not hot, then you're just like, all right, take camera one, camera two, take  camera three, back to camera two, back to three.  You're just rocking the switches. 
[00:10:30]  Keep cutting.  All right.  Have it push into her face real fast and then cut away.  Right, right.  We're going to try something artistic in this next section of the video.  Get a strobe light going when we have her on and then.  Right.  Anyone have any Vaseline for the camera lens?  We need the heart camera lens.  Yeah.  So I don't know.  I mean, the jury's still out.  I mean, she looks kind of, I don't know.  She looks all right.  She looks kind of what?  A little beat up for her age, I'm thinking. 
[00:11:00]  Really?  That's what I think.  Wow.  And it's weird because it's her and some dude on the drums.  And then during the taping yesterday, I guess they have a guitar player.  What song did they do?  They did that one?  Yeah, the big one.  And the guitar player's just playing off camera.  Really?  I don't know if I would pay money to see that.  Like two people on a stage.  How did it sound like?  One is just jamming the drums and good.  She pulled it off.  You know.  She lip syncing it or she actually do it?  It seemed like she was doing it. 
[00:11:30]  So.  And then Fallon had Chet from Weird Science on yesterday.  Chet from Weird Science is Bill Paxton.  No.  He'll always be Chet.  The obnoxious older brother from Weird Science.  That's what he was calling him?  Yeah.  It was cool though because he joked about it too.  He did?  He goes, oh, I could be in a hundred movies or whatever he said.  And my obituary will say he played Chet from Weird Science.  Chet.  But they didn't get into any twister discussion, unfortunately. 
[00:12:00]  Oh, wow.  Yeah, that would have been.  I think Paxton passed on us.  It's too bad because he.  Just watching him.  Do you want Bill Paxton?  Yeah, we say yes.  Yes, we do.  He won't come in.  All right, thanks.  Obama will be in town.  Should I try?  I know he will be in New York.  The motorcade should be coming close.  We could get him.  You know what's great?  You watch late night TV and you notice all the people that passed on us.  Because you go, wait, we said yes to that one. 
[00:12:30]  It's like, yeah, we said.  Wait, we said yes to them.  You know what it is?  Yeah, we forget.  Because Steve comes in here and gives us a laundry list.  You want Paxton?  Yes, of course.  He asked us if we wanted the Kardashians.  No, Steve.  We don't want the Kardashians in here.  Of course we do.  Of course we do.  The Ting-Tings.  Yeah, it was pretty much Jimmy Fallon's show yesterday.  We said yes to all of them.  To all those people.  And then I'm sitting there in the audience going, motherfucker.  All these people passed on the O.P. and Anthony show.  They passed on us.  And Paxton, he's sitting there with Jimmy Fallon. 
[00:13:00]  I'm like, this guy would have had a ball on the O.P. and Anthony show.  He was having fun with the whole Chet Weird Science day.  He seems like a fun guy.  He was really cool.  Really cool.  Could have got into the Twister thing.  Could have got into the fact that he's in every James Cameron movie like you were telling me.  Yeah, they throw him in.  I didn't realize that, actually.  I forgot he was in Titanic.  Yeah, he was like the guy from the modern times that were going down trying to find the necklace.  And then he was in Terminator, the first Terminator.  I remember that.  He was one of the punk guys that gets his ass ripped apart. 
[00:13:30]  Kind of had a small role on that.  Yeah, right at the beginning where it's like, your clothes, give them to me now.  Paxton was one of those dudes.  Yeah, he was one of those guys.  He was a kid.  For some reason, I remember that.  He had his hair, like, spiked.  He looked really silly.  And, yeah, apparently he just puts him in every single goddamn movie.  Aliens.  You know the second one, the sequel?  That's a James Cameron.  But I think James Cameron secretly hates him because he kills him off pretty good in all these movies.  Yeah. 
[00:14:00]  What are you getting?  I got it.  Oh, you got a picture?  Yeah.  I love that.  And then the Kardashian broads were on.  Yeah, that's it.  Look at him with the blue spiky hair.  The blue spiky hair.  That's hysterical.  And the tire tread makeup on the side of his face.  How many years after Weird Science was that?  Only a couple, probably.  Was it three or four, maybe?  Terminator was 84.  Was it before or after?  Oh, yeah, all right.  So Weird Science was 81.  Yeah, yeah, okay. 
[00:14:30]  I'm going to go with 81 for Weird Science.  Like in Weird Science when he's like, just spitting this.  Yeah.  He's such a prick to his younger brother.  And then the Kardashians, hot as all hell, but I'm sitting there and the whole crowd is like,  you can feel it.  They're like, why are they famous?  Yeah.  They're famous for being really hot and sort of saying outrageous things about sex.  Paris Hilton pulled that off for a while.  It's a trend. 
[00:15:00]  Do we need new whores?  Do we need new whores?  They're in season three of Keeping Up with the Kardashians, so they're doing something right.  She's a whore.  They're all whores.  If you listen to what they're saying on that TV show.  Yeah.  Including the mom.  That's their whole gimmick.  It's the whole act is to go out, be a whore, act like you're a moron and say stupid stuff.  Yeah.  That's their show.  It's sad because we, collectively, probably most likely not. 
[00:15:30]  We, the people of the United States of America.  Yeah, exactly.  Probably not much of our audience, but we watch it.  And that's why they're on Jimmy Fallon.  Yeah.  And that's why they're doing everything else, because people are watching that shit.  Yeah, they turned us down, huh?  I guess.  What happened, Steve?  Steve, we said yes to the Kardashians, right?  We say yes to everybody.  Yeah, I know.  We say yes to everybody.  The answer I get is either they passed outright, or they're not a morning person.  Yeah.  And that's what you get across the board. 
[00:16:00]  Now, whether or not that's the real reason, I have no idea.  Not a morning person.  Because there's so many people in between this show and the actual personality.  You don't really know what the reason is.  Occasionally, you see them on the morning TV shows, though.  When we were needy, which is like the NEW days, we would buy into all these excuses.  Like, oh, it could be possible.  Oh, it's possible.  I bet they're very busy.  We know all these excuses now.  They really have to come up with better ones.  Yeah, come up with better excuses.  I'm not a morning person.  You know, you're in Hollywood, and you're trying to get people to tune into whatever the  hell you're pushing.  Right. 
[00:16:30]  Oh, you're going to get up in the morning to push that.  Yeah.  Half the time, what we're finding out is that the actual personality doesn't even find out  about the request.  You've got some rep who tells you no.  Right.  So you try to circumvent it as much as humanly possible.  That's too bad.  They'll just bring them in, and I know it happens.  They rip them apart, and they go on information from the French guy from Hogan's Heroes and  what he went through.  Right, right.  Of course, that wouldn't happen.  Jesus.  Unbelievable.  Yeah, you really don't know who's making the decision.  Did you lose your voice yesterday? 
[00:17:00]  I lost my voice.  No.  It came back today.  During the show, it was a little rough hearing, so we were yelling a lot.  We did our live broadcast, obviously.  Yeah, yeah.  It went really well.  And I don't even know if the broadcast did it justice, how loud it was in that place.  Yeah, it was really loud.  At one point, we were just shouting into microphones.  It was very hard to talk.  Yeah, it was shouting into the mic.  I heard my mic gate out a couple of times, because I was yelling into it, so I had to 
[00:17:30]  kind of back off and talk normally.  But yeah, it was getting a little scratchy yesterday.  But man, what a weird sleep pattern I had yesterday.  Really?  Because when you start your day and then start drinking at about 8 in the morning with a  couple of Guinness, and then the show went really well, we're done with the show, and  I stayed at the bar for a while. 
[00:18:00]  A lot of fans, met a lot of listeners, a lot of new listeners, like you were saying, which  was pretty cool.  It was nice to see some fresh faces out there.  Yeah.  It was nice to see some women, too.  I know.  Oh, very odd.  You know, some women were there, and new fans.  Yeah, it's good to see.  Absolutely.  So a couple of guys at the bar were just like, hey, Anthony, do a car bomb with us.  Oh, my God.  I'm like, all right.  It's St. Paddy's Day, and I've already had a few Guinness, so I pound that one down. 
[00:18:30]  And without eating anything and chugging a full Guinness with the car bomb in it and  everything, the second I put the glass down, I was like, wow, I'm on the road to Hammerdom.  So I just kept drinking some more Guinness.  I had a driver.  I didn't care.  Keith was driving me.  Well, now that you're on the road, you've got to get to the destination.  Unlike me, I was on the road to the Joshua Tree crap, and I turned around.  I should have stayed on the road like Anthony. 
[00:19:00]  When you're on the road to somewhere, you've got to get there.  You've got to get there.  That's what it is.  That's the difference.  I turned around.  I never got to the Joshua Tree National Park or whatever the fuck it's called.  You turned around.  So by the time it's like, I don't know, noon, I felt like it was already 10, 11 o'clock at night.  Right.  To me, it felt like that was the full day. 
[00:19:30]  You'd partied.  It's done.  It's time to go home and go to sleep.  But logically, it is.  Yeah, yeah.  Because there's no logic being – logic isn't coming into play at that point.  The Guinnesses are talking.  I don't really go down that road often anymore, but I have, so I have my memories.  And when you're that hammered that early and then you go home and like, all right, well,  now I'm going to do some chores and I'm going to pay some bills.  Yeah, yeah.  Right.  I might rake out the yard or whatever the fuck you do in your life. 
[00:20:00]  No, it might as well be time for bed because there's nothing else you could do in that state.  I got home, went into my office, and I wanted to watch the Apple iPhone 3.0 presentation.  I heard it's good.  That was given.  I heard it's real good.  I click play, I open up the QuickTime player real big, and I'm sitting there watching going,  all right, well, this looks cool.  Wow, this is going to be a great update for the – 
[00:20:30]  Really?  Jeep, jeep, jeep.  I was out.  And then I snap awake, and it's 7 o'clock at night.  I think I started watching the video at about 5.  I had sat in my office chair, just kind of slumped over asleep until 7 o'clock.  Oh, my God.  And then I just – I was like, all right, 7, screw it.  Went right to bed.  By 7.15, I was out. 
[00:21:00]  Amazing.  And I slept right up until the alarm went off to get up to come back in here.  And I'm like, right when the alarm went off, I went to myself.  I'm just going, no, no, not again this soon.  Really?  I've got to get up again.  Yeah, because when you sleep right through, it just seems like, you know –  It was instant.  It's instant, yeah.  I hate you, man.  My sleep sucks.  Always, always has.  Oh, and yet –  You could sleep anywhere.  Yeah.  Anywhere.  I've seen it.  Yeah, that's true.  On planes.  I mean, a tiny little bit of turbulence. 
[00:21:30]  I'm away.  You just like – like you talk about it.  It's like a time machine for you.  I hate that you could do that.  Yeah, the flight attendant would have been like, you know –  Hello, Mr. Kumiya.  We're in the Hudson.  Could you please get out on the wing?  Yeah, that would be you.  You'd be –  I'm sleeping.  You would be like scratching your head.  Hang on.  You'd be the last one out of the plane.  I'm tired.  All right.  What the hell?  I got a few minutes.  Yeah.  Let everyone else get out.  But I think we're back here with live broadcast because it was a biggie, and I think we should 
[00:22:00]  do more of those.  Yes.  We kind of made it up as we went along, like old school.  Yeah.  And it was fun.  It was great.  I'm Voss and Colin in there.  Yeah.  They did a great job.  Yep.  A lot of fun.  Definitely.  And then the cast of characters.  Did you see –  Colin frigging loves Stalker Patty.  Yeah.  Stalker Patty makes Colin laugh his ass off because her – and for the same shit we laugh  at her about, her improv is horrendous.  Horrendous.  It's terrible.  Yeah. 
[00:22:30]  She does not know what to say when someone says a joke to her or anything.  Well, he did a show – I was thinking that the other day.  Oh, wait.  Are you talking, Jimmy?  Yes.  It's Jimmy.  Hold on.  Wait.  Jimmy's talking.  Jimmy has his own intro now.  Hold on a minute.  Does he?  Yes, he – of course he does.  Jimmy, I'm sorry.  You've got to, like, point to me when you're ready for your intro.  Oh.  My name is Jim, a very popular comedian.  You can hear him every morning on the Opie and Anthony radio show, the most popular show  in the history of satellite radio.  Pretty amazing.  His new DVD, HBO's Down and Dirty with Jim Norton, will be available April 7th. 
[00:23:00]  And please welcome Jim Norton.  All right, Jim, you were saying –  I was saying that –  That's going to be the bit all day.  That's nice.  I was saying that I remember.  I like that.  That –  Oh, boy, did that get under someone's skin.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Whoa.  Oh, no.  Whoa.  God, it's so easy to get under his skin.  When we were doing Tough Crowds, instead of friends, Colin did a sketch with her, Patty 
[00:23:30]  and someone else, and he called it Chums.  Chums.  Yeah.  It was some awful – like, they were buddies.  Yeah.  It was a terrible sitcom.  Oh, it was really bad.  I don't remember.  I remember that.  Colin probably has tape.  I would love to see that now, like, six years later.  Patty.  Colin likes all the creeps that we've discovered.  Oh, yeah.  Because he's starting to become a huge fan of Bobo already.  Bobo.  He kind of chuckles at David.  Bobo came right up to Colin.  Pat from Minaki, loves.  Yeah.  Bobo went right up to Colin the second Colin came in, because Colin kind of stood by the 
[00:24:00]  little roped-off area, but didn't come into it, and just stood there, and he goes,  Hey, start the show!  What are you guys waiting for?  And he starts yelling at us like he's in the crowd.  And Bobo turns around and goes, Oh, my God, it's Colin Quinn.  I love you.  You're fantastic.  Yeah.  And Colin's just like, Who is this guy?  Oh, it's Bobo.  Yeah.  Now you've got to meet Bobo.  Yeah.  And David, he loves David.  We learned a lot about Bobo.  Bobo's father was 6'6". 
[00:24:30]  A Navy SEAL?  Yes, Navy SEAL.  I think a Navy SEAL in Vietnam.  Yeah.  6'6 Navy SEAL from Vietnam.  Died when Bobo was, I think, four or something.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  And he's got a brother, I guess.  Bobo has a brother that's a tall mother effer.  Yeah.  I gave Bobo, later on after everybody left, I gave him some grooming tips.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I told him, look, get a scissor and clip those goddamn nostril hairs. 
[00:25:00]  He's got nose hair?  Dude.  He's too young for nose hair.  It's flying out.  They're like points that come out of his nose, nostril hairs.  Yeah.  I'm like, you've got to cut those off.  Yeah.  You've got to get that.  What do you do in?  Thing.  The groomer.  Yeah.  The wood chipper for nostril hair.  This is how it sounds.  That's when you know you're getting some good ones.  It's like, great.  What the hell is in there?  What's going on in there?  I never listened to David and Bobo until we watched it last week. 
[00:25:30]  Oh, my God.  Well, I have not enjoyed anything that much.  It'd be only 10 years.  People don't know we hung out for that entire thing.  Usually, we're like, all right, David and Bobo, we get to go home early.  And that was supposed to be 10, 15 minutes, and it went about 40.  It was great.  Because we couldn't stop it.  It was just going way too well.  Yeah, I usually run to my car and listen to it on the way home.  Right.  But I knew they were starting, so I was like, no, let me hang out for a little while at  least and just watch the beginning of this.  I couldn't leave.  It was amazing. 
[00:26:00]  Bobo was wrecking Anthony's bit because when he found out the Navy SEAL father from  Vietnam, he was doing Bobo doing platoon lines.  But Bobo decided he still needed to talk and was ruining the entire thing.  That could have been just gold.  Oh, was he ruining it?  He was stepping all over my platoon lines.  Yeah.  I was doing his father as Barnes.  Yeah.  And he's ruining all your lines because what he has to say is more important.  So he's like, I actually owe that DVD. 
[00:26:30]  Yeah, yeah.  He goes, I'm trying to put two lines here.  He's stepping all over me, Bobo.  He's like, I owe the DVD.  I actually owe that one.  I don't know exactly where it is.  I bought it a while ago.  I think it might be in my mother's basement, but I need to try and find it.  It just comes out with this crap.  The radio in my car is like out, so I don't have a radio in my car.  So talking like Bobo everywhere I drive is my new favorite thing on the Facebook planet.  It is fun to just talk like Bobo. 
[00:27:00]  I hope there isn't any traffic on the cross island because I would like to get where I'm going.  I need to cross the island.  On the cross island.  It's Woody Allen meets who?  There's Woody Allen in there.  Yeah, there's a little Woody Allen.  There's somebody else.  Forrest Gump.  He brings it all together.  How was LA, Jimmy?  It was good, man.  I mean, it was nice.  Did Leno say hi to us?  He actually did.  Yeah, he likes you guys a lot.  Are you lying?  No, I'm not.  The first thing he asked me to come to the dressing room was like, how are the guys doing?  How's the show?  Yeah. 
[00:27:30]  And I talked about the format flip and how annoying it was.  He's like, yeah, they're still doing great.  He was very happy to hear that all was well.  Your set was amazing.  Thank you, man.  It really was.  It looked like two guys just kind of hanging out.  He got a little nervous by a few of your lines, huh?  He let a lot of shit go.  Yeah.  We played it on the show yesterday.  I'm like, wow, he let that.  I mean, I was kind of going along with the set going, God damn, Jay.  God bless you.  You know what, though?  He had a couple of real good ones during his monologue where he has some gay jokes in there 
[00:28:00]  and stuff that you normally wouldn't.  You think he just doesn't care?  I really do think it's just like, you know, that's good.  There's definitely two things that happen.  It's like you decide how edgy you're going to get as a performer and then the lawyers  will decide.  Right.  So I think he's pushing his own edge.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, yeah.  Like, he's like, you know what?  What the hell?  I could do these type of jokes now.  I have nothing to lose.  Yeah.  Before he might have thought, maybe this isn't smart for what I'm trying to accomplish here  with The Tonight Show. 
[00:28:30]  I don't know.  It just seems different.  He's always been a little different.  I had a line with erection in it.  I didn't use it because I forgot it.  It was one I wasn't able to find exactly a place for.  But I went over it with the guys, Bob and Ross.  And I'm like, I say erection, but it's not like there's nothing nasty.  They're like, okay, that's fine.  That's medical.  You can say it like that.  Like, it's so easy.  That would have just been on some other shows.  They would.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Some other shows.  How about our old radio show?  That's what I'm saying.  The morning radio show.  Yeah, some other.  What are you talking about some other shows?  I can't think of any offhand.  Oh, wait.  Yes, our show.  That's why that was such a nightmare. 
[00:29:00]  It's like, you can't say erection on a more.  Don't worry.  I'm not going to bitch too much.  But the morning show we used to do.  But you can say erection on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno on NBC.  It's like, come on, man.  You know, one of the biggest worries we had when the format flip happened and, you know,  we were released from K-Rock was we didn't want to go back to just satellite because a  lot of people listen to regular radio. 
[00:29:30]  When you go to an appearance, a lot of people say, oh, I listen to you on K-Rock.  I listen to you on FM, this, that.  But that wasn't the case yesterday.  It was amazing.  Right.  A lot of, I think a lot has changed over the years since we were exclusively satellite at  first.  Absolutely.  And now we're exclusively satellite now.  And I'm not trying to rationalize anything.  But we're a fuck of a lot of people that were like, dude, I'm so glad you're exclusively  on satellite now.  Yeah, I listen on Sirius XM, whatever. 
[00:30:00]  It really has changed over the course of the years when we were on FM.  I think we're heading into the second stage, too.  Yeah.  Because like you said, when we were exclusive the first time around, there were still, you  know, I didn't like a lot of the shows, but there were shows to choose from for the people  out there that like talk shows, like edgy, you know, shows.  All of those are gone.  We were basically the last one.  The only ones left now lean more toward a political talk show with maybe some humor thrown 
[00:30:30]  in, like an Imus.  Imus is definitely more political than funny, right?  Yeah, yeah.  And so everyone is gone.  And now you got the station we used to be on playing 10,000 songs.  Who knows how many they're up to?  Wow, that's got to be crazy.  Jeez.  But all those people are now just rocking the dialogue going, wait, I need more than  just music in the morning when I'm going to work.  So I think it's going to I think you're going to see a little surge in people picking up  the satellite radio and picking up other ways to get, you know, talk shows. 
[00:31:00]  Yeah, all those high profile kind of outrageous under the term shock jock shows, they're gone  off a regular radio.  You can't it just doesn't happen anymore.  Dude, some of the guy, Jimmy.  No, no.  So even though the audio industry is taking a beating right now, you're looking now at  three years down the road of factory installs.  So it's like for the last three years, people have been buying cars that most have been equipped  with either XM or Sirius or now.  So it's like three years of factory installs.  There's a lot of fucking people who now just have it because it's in their car. 
[00:31:30]  So they just order it.  It's like it is a lot better now than it was.  Yeah, it was kind of happening.  Like at the beginning, when we first signed on to satellite, it was all right, here's  some stray wires in your car.  And here's a piece of double sided tape to stick to your dashboard on your new car.  That was always nice.  It's like you got a new car and you got these wires.  Here's a vent clip.  Oh, yeah.  You want a vent clip?  No, I want my AC.  I felt like I had to be part of the geek squad to set it all up. 
[00:32:00]  I was like, I don't know this.  I just want to show my dad how to use satellite radio.  It looks so cheesy.  You go to step on the brake and you pull the wire out because it's down by your feet.  It was just so cheesy.  Right.  And like Jim said, it was hard back then to realize you're gone.  We're just screwed because no one's got it in their car.  And no one wants this jury rigged shit in their car.  And your iPhone there.  I mean, that's starting to really pop. 
[00:32:30]  As far as it's popping already.  I know that.  But as far as getting content, it's popping now.  Travis, I wanted to smack him in the fucking head last night.  Wow.  Well, he sends me a text and he's like, he goes, have you seen the new operating system,  the 3.0 for the iPhone?  And I'm like, no, I haven't seen that yet.  Oh, it's fantastic. 
[00:33:00]  Texting, pictures over text.  Finally, pictures over text.  And then a bunch of other goodness that is going to be part of the 3.0.  Right.  So I'm like, cool.  I'm so psyched to get home, plug it in and get my update.  And then he says, yeah, should be coming.  And this is like way later.  Should be coming out sometime in the summer.  I'm like, well, shouldn't you have said that first?  Like, hey, three months from now, this is what it's going to be. 
[00:33:30]  Because he got me all excited that I'm popping in and upgrading when I get home.  And you fucked me.  It's still what?  A couple months out?  Yes.  I was so annoyed with Travis.  I was just the bearer of good news.  Good news.  Yeah.  But it's like in three months, good news.  It's not going to be three months.  Don't push this forward.  That's a 3.0.  Yeah.  That's 3.0, dude.  No, I'm kidding.  What is this?  No.  I don't know.  It was like a prototype version.  So that's why it looks like an old 1997 soundboard. 
[00:34:00]  Gotcha.  But finally, pictures over text, which we were saying we can only imagine how bad the service  charge is going to be for that one.  Oh, they're going to kill us.  They're going to have to, what, get a new plan or something?  You think so?  Yeah, because it's not included now.  It's just text.  Like, I have unlimited texting, but it's like, wait a minute.  Not with pictures, you don't.  Here's the new plan.  So it's going to be even more, but. 
[00:34:30]  Even though it costs them nothing.  Of course.  Like, I read like a text costs like one penny for them to send, literally.  Really?  Yeah, but they charge you like, you know, 10 or 15 cents if you go over.  Yeah.  I bet you it costs even less than a penny.  Perhaps less than that.  I have to be honest with you.  Yeah.  Their cost.  But they do a good job, though.  Viewmymessage.com is where you go for your, it's so, it's really efficient.  Like, if you want to.  It's so convenient.  Yeah, you get a text, oh, let me get to a computer, go to the website, try five or six  times, pick it right up, look at it, post a stamp size, uh, wonderful.  Really good.  That cannot be enlarged. 
[00:35:00]  Terrific.  They're figuring that out, finally.  In a few short months, that'll all be over.  Yeah.  You know, you can't, that annoys the piss out of me.  You have a message.  Go to viewmymessage.com and put in this code that you can't possibly remember.  So you have to keep switching back and forth, and then you can't even do it on the iPhone.  Now that's all fixed with cut and paste.  You can't do it on, well, cut and paste will be a new feature.  You can't even click on a link when you get to that website?  I've never gotten a picture message.  No, no.  Oh, my.  You have to go, you have to go to a computer.  Yeah, no.  Go to that website, then look at your phone and punch in the code. 
[00:35:30]  Oh, my gosh.  And then you get a postage stamp size picture.  I thought you at least clicked on it after you got to the website.  No.  What a nightmare.  So I just tell people, email me pictures, because that works.  Yeah.  But finally, pictures over text will be great.  Hey, where's David?  Jimmy, I guess you missed it, but David is going to be giving intern reviews today.  Oh, good.  Intern reviews.  He's very serious about this.  Yes.  Sam, is David almost ready to... 
[00:36:00]  He's not ready.  He doesn't even have his tie on.  Look at him.  God damn it.  I'm working hard.  I've rolled up my shirt sleeves.  I wonder why David looks so dapper.  Yeah, David.  Yes.  Hello.  Hey, David.  Do you know how to tie a tie?  Yes, I know how.  You want me to tie you up with some of your ties?  Tie.  You know what movie that's from?  No, I don't.  All right.  Figures.  I don't know.  Jesus.  What's your favorite comedy of all time?  What is it from?  No.  I'm asking you a new question.  You OCD freak.  What's your favorite comedy of all time? 
[00:36:30]  Comedy movie?  No, no.  You're out on the street and you see a mom.  A Broadway comedy.  Yes.  Movie.  Movie?  I told you.  I like Meet the Parents a lot.  Okay.  It's really funny.  You might have told me that.  All right.  That is a good one.  Well, that line was from Caddyshack.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  So you're going to put the tie on.  You're going to do some intern reviews today?  You're winning that intern review.  That's important.  You shouldn't be laughing because you don't know the movie.  You don't know the movie.  Yeah.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Ahoy, polloi.  You look like you just walked off of a Scotch ad. 
[00:37:00]  See, no laugh.  Good.  Good.  You didn't see the movie.  Right.  Test them all day now.  Yeah.  David.  Yes.  Did you like the live broadcast yesterday?  Yes, I liked it a lot.  It was very good.  She's easy to grin.  Shouldn't laugh about it.  I shouldn't laugh.  He kind of just smirked.  He kind of just went, kind of like the boys because it was funny, you know.  Live broadcast was a good, I think it worked well. 
[00:37:30]  There are a lot of people that are surprised by that.  Were you?  Why, David?  That's encouraging.  Yeah, really.  Why were you surprised that we actually have fans listening to this?  No, not that we have fans.  I know you have fans, but I didn't know that they were all going to show up.  All?  Thanks, David.  All of them.  I know they were going to show up.  Thank you.  So one bar fits all of our fans.  Yeah, you might want to work for Howard's show because that's what he says.  No, I didn't mean all.  I meant, like, I didn't know how they would show up.  I didn't realize they would.  That was great.  Okay.  But it wasn't organized.  You're not, you need organization, don't you, David?  That's true. 
[00:38:00]  It wasn't organized.  E-Rock did a bad job, right?  That is true.  You're right.  Why are you blaming E-Rock?  You're right about that.  All right.  Yes, Sam.  We got back to the office, and he said he was still pissed off at E-Rock for letting 2U play  two songs when you guys were supposed to do a live recording.  Oh, yes.  That was the biggest disaster of any live show we've ever done.  Yeah.  David, who are you going to review first?  That's a good question.  I haven't thought about the order of reviews.  Oh.  All right.  Well, after the break, we want to have this set up. 
[00:38:30]  You're setting up a nice little office, a desk.  Who's going to be the first person that I review?  Cinderella boy lines up his last shot.  Do it with me.  Former groundskeeper now about to become the master's champ.  Perfect.  Oh, we got it out of that one.  Just straight face.  There's not a smile on that stupid face.  I love it.  All right.  You have to decide.  You're the boss today.  The boss decides.  We have five interns that are-  Who do you think should go first?  We have five interns that showed up. 
[00:39:00]  Who do you want first?  I'm not sure.  Oh, my God.  He can't even make a decision.  I don't know who should go first.  You would fail this review.  He's very upset and disheveled right now because Jill, our female intern, was told to show  up today.  Yeah.  And we were supposed to have six.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But she didn't show up.  Uh-oh.  And so now we have five, and that kind of throws everything out of the loop.  Now, is that going to reflect on her review?  Yes.  It's because she said that she would make an effort to show up today on a day that she  doesn't come, and she said she would try to come in. 
[00:39:30]  All right.  So that wasn't a definite yes.  No, but she said she would make an effort, and she would try to come in.  She probably hasn't.  That makes you mad, David?  I like David when he laughs.  He's just like a psychopath.  All right.  I love it.  And he just stops laughing immediately.  Back to a straight face.  If you want to know how it's like to talk to David, like, if you're in your car right  now, just jam on your brakes, hit the gas, jam on your brakes, hit the gas, jam on your 
[00:40:00]  brakes, hit the gas, over and over again.  Yeah.  It's tough to get a flow going with this guy.  David.  Yes.  Sam is the bad, the devil on the shoulder.  Of course.  And there's no angel.  And Sam is the devil, and he's constantly whispering in his ear.  Right.  And David has to either do it or shrug him off.  Yeah.  And we just looked at a shrug him off.  He goes, I don't know. 
[00:40:30]  There's wrestling tactics going on.  Oh, hell yeah.  Sam is David's handler.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And David, I'm not a devil.  I'm supporting David.  Oh, shut up.  I'm here to watch his back.  You guys were over here yesterday saying Paul is the superstar intern.  Yes.  When obviously you're looking at the superstar intern.  Oh, snap.  All right, David.  I want to see him tie his tie.  I bet he can't do it.  Can you tie your tie, David?  Yes, I can tie it.  He obviously could tie his tie.  He's one of those guys.  I know how to tie the tie, yeah.  Yeah.  Of course he can.  Do you do a double Windsor?  Double Windsor. 
[00:41:00]  Double Windsor.  Why not?  Why not?  Double Windsor.  It is.  Yeah.  All right, Dave.  We're going to set up your little review area.  After the break, you're going to be sitting there.  You're going to do one.  Okay.  We're going to spread them out throughout the show.  Make them quick.  Because the fans love you as long as you're not on the radio too long.  Okay.  That's the key with you.  Not long, involved bits.  Quick.  You know, in the future, they'll have two ties coming down your shirt.  Two?  Wow.  Two.  Yeah. 
[00:41:30]  I believe that fashion starts in 2014.  Okay.  I'll be ready.  I'll be ready.  All right, Dave.  I own that on DVD.  I own that.  I know what movie you're talking about.  About?  I picked up the Trinity.  All right.  Why don't you guys sit up to the studio?  We'll take a break.  And we'll do David's first intern review after the break. 
[00:42:00]  And get into some other things.  Yeah.  Natasha Richardson is going to die, man.  Holy crap.  It's the big story today.  Yeah.  The big story is how fucked up that is.  Yeah.  Let me...  I did...  I haven't skied in a couple seasons, unfortunately, but for no particular reason.  I want to get back out there.  But I'll talk about it a little bit.  It's amazing, to be honest with you.  This isn't a Sonny Bono thing whatsoever.  No, no.  Or a...  I heard no trees, nothing.  So we'll get into that and some other things in a few minutes.  Opie and Anthony.  We'll be right back. </pre>
