<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with a protracted and exasperated discussion about the studio's new lighting system. Opie, Anthony, and Jimmy vehemently complained about the intensity and intrusiveness of the lights, describing them as unsuitable for daily broadcasting despite being adequate for video shoots.  They detailed a history of complaints to the lighting technicians, specifically mentioning Travis, and proposed solutions like relocating the track lighting. The discussion highlighted Opie's particular sensitivity to bright light.

The conversation then transitioned to Tim Tebow's arrival in New York, with the hosts speculating about his role with the Jets and the potential impact on Mark Sanchez.  The segment included a reference to a Pat Robertson clip commenting on Tebow.

The show concluded with Jimmy sharing an anecdote about witnessing a medical emergency on the street involving an overweight man who received CPR. Jimmy expressed concern about the man's subsequent condition.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  Morning.  Morning.  Morning.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Get your car.  Rub your car.  Rub your car.  Good morning.  Rub that car.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Rub the car.  Oh, Jimmy.  Good morning.  What's going on in your head, Jimmy?  Nothing.  It's nice to be doing radio here at Close Encounters. 
[00:00:30]  Ha, ha, yeah.  Don't mention the lights.  They worked very hard at the lights last night.  Ixnay on the iteslay.  They were here very late working on the lights.  I never noticed.  I could care less about the lights.  They're always fine for me as long as they're not in my face.  And, like, this is...  I'm, like, looking up and there's giant, like, light cells.  You're like a little deer with the headlights.  I really am.  I was just trying to cross the road.  I meant D-E-A-R.  I was fawning around.  Fawning.  But the lights were never good.  That's why we had to, like, redo them.  There seems to be a thing where it's like, ah, regular studio lights, like a regular radio station where it doesn't matter to do video. 
[00:01:00]  And then video lighting, which is what we have in here now with these little flat panel LED lights.  Right.  But, like, they're kind of new and different and in our peripherals.  So it's going to take a little getting used to.  They're six inches from the top of our heads.  Exactly.  They're a little too close.  Jimmy said they're intrusive.  Intrusive, huh?  Well, all we wanted was better lighting in the studio in general. 
[00:01:30]  Yeah.  And I don't think we've accomplished that still.  Like, better lighting.  We got better lighting for shooting video.  But, like, just normal, everyday lighting.  But we've been talking about the lighting in the studio for...  Does anyone know the first time we brought it up?  Sam, by the way, is just laughing.  Why are you laughing?  He's like, oh, boy, oh, there's trouble.  And I love looking at trouble.  Look, I was just sitting back, man.  Jimmy was the one that brought this one up.  Anthony got it 100% right.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  That's exactly right.  It's just we need good regular lighting. 
[00:02:00]  Because they specifically have been trying to do good video lighting.  Yeah, yeah.  But we just need good regular lighting.  That's not what they're going for.  But if you go back in time, I mean, we record everything.  Yeah.  We have many discussions where we just wanted better lights.  They always take what we ask for and then bastardize it some way and make it something else.  Or they take, like, a kernel.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And they say, this is what we can do.  Or a major.  Oh, that's very good.  No, it's not.  And then they run with it.  And then we get this.  Which, like, I was saying, don't get me wrong. 
[00:02:30]  I like this.  I'm a video-like guy.  I love it.  I kind of think it's cool.  This will be better when you're shooting a little video or a quick picture of Jim Norton or something.  As a matter of fact, I'm looking at the PalTalk video feed right now that we're throwing out.  And aside from me being on the camera, it looks great.  It, like, looks nice.  The color is good.  It's sharp.  It's, like, it looks better.  It's not much better.  For interviews, it's got to be up really bright.  It's just going to be in my little eyes.  Well, yeah.  I don't like lights in my eyes. 
[00:03:00]  But it still doesn't solve the problem.  We just want better lights in the studio.  Just better regular lighting.  Which is the...  That was the original discussion.  And I'm looking over at the couch.  Is that the couch?  I can't really see it.  I don't know.  That's in the dark.  I can't really see it over there.  It looks like a space view of Earth, this room.  So, I like the lights.  But, again, we just need good regular lighting.  Because they got this track lighting, like, from 19-fucking-75.  Well, that's...  Originally, I said to the guys that the track lighting is the problem.  Because when I first saw the studio for us, there were cabinets that came all the way out where you sit. 
[00:03:30]  Yeah.  And that's why the track lights are how they are.  It's so close to the middle of the room.  So, the real solution would be to rip out the track lighting and readjust them for the new design of the studio.  Which is not a new design anymore.  We've been here three years.  Was this console put in for this show?  Yes, all that.  Oh, okay, okay.  This was a completely different studio.  And that's why the lights are how they are, because...  Made them against the walls.  Yeah.  How this was originally set up, these lights made sense.  I tried to tell them that a long time ago. 
[00:04:00]  If you put, not these track lights, maybe different ones, though, but all along the perimeter...  You have to re-light the studio from scratch, going, oh, okay, this is how the studio is set up now.  What, Travis?  Travis is shaking his head with his...  His head is in his hands, and he's just shaking his head like...  I told Travis that it's not his fault.  You know, you're not...  This has nothing to do with you.  It's guys that don't really listen, probably.  I just don't want to be here until 6 o'clock another day.  Oh.  You're right.  No.  Because I saw you tweeted pictures of this process going on. 
[00:04:30]  Nice long day yesterday.  I'm like, oh, why?  If you move these track lights all the way to the wall, right?  Yeah, yeah.  And then move these...  I don't know exactly, because I'm not a lighting guy.  I think all along the perimeter, shining in...  Then we would be good.  Yeah.  And then you keep these for the interviews and stuff.  Right.  And then we flick these on when we're doing video, when a guest comes in and sits there  and we have a video shoot going on, and then it looks nice.  Is that what the team of lighting experts around here thinks?  Well, no, no.  If I'm talking to Ope during an interview and I notice that the light is really hurting 
[00:05:00]  my eyes, there's something not natural about that.  Oh, no.  Well, in order to do video, I mean, you do kind of naturally.  But that's not what we asked for.  Oh, I know.  Okay.  I know.  I'm going to disagree with you.  I guarantee if you go back to find the first thing, when this started, you wanted better  lights for video and photos.  Well, I said because...  Is that your diagnosis, Dr. Gay?  Yes.  Thanks.  Yeah, thanks.  That was probably...  Yeah, that was definitely part of it.  But it was... 
[00:05:30]  I said the lighting in general in here sucks.  And when we take video and pictures, the pictures don't come out as well as they should.  But now they took that little nugget and said, oh, okay, we'll light this place better  when you guys are shooting video and pictures.  But we still need just better lights when we're just doing the regular show, when we're  not going to pick up our cameras.  Gary and those guys feel like Private Pyle.  Sir, the private feels like any lights we put in will be wrong, sir.  And we'll be thinking if we don't deserve to reverse ourselves.  Look, let the record show.  I wasn't going to say anything.  Jimmy kept staring at the lights. 
[00:06:00]  I just noticed...  You want me to turn that light off?  Yeah, but no, leave it on.  I got to get used to it because when we have interviews, it's going to have to be on.  And it's in my...  I don't care about...  I never care about the lights.  I don't give a fuck if it's pitch black in here.  Well, how about we move the track lighting next?  You want to do that right now?  No, that's too much work.  Well, actually, somewhere around probably 5, 36 o'clock tonight, we could do that on a  Friday.  My friend Arnold Tracus has a track lighting business.  He can come in.  Yeah, Tracus.  He's a great guy, expert, born to track light. 
[00:06:30]  This track lighting was for the old studio setup.  Yeah.  See, because there's not even lights over there at all.  That is true.  There's track lighting in here.  That is a good point.  There's one fluorescent behind me.  We set a triangle.  And...  Triangulation!  A crossfire!  And it is built.  What was here where the sofa is?  I forget now.  We redesigned this whole place for us. 
[00:07:00]  A fish hatchery.  It used to be in the corner over there with the TV.  What did they do here?  All the bats would sleep right here in the dark.  Wait, where was the console?  Over there in the corner where the TVs were.  Oh.  That's where the console was.  And then this whole area where you guys are sitting was like a half moon thing for guests  and, yeah, cabinets and storage and stuff.  Yeah, there were a lot of cabinets in here for whatever reason.  That's crazy.  Shelves and whatnot.  Oh.  Well, you know what?  I kind of...  I'm getting used to it. 
[00:07:30]  Because it's right in my face.  Like...  Yeah.  You're looking straight ahead.  But that was...  The payoff is you get to look at E-Rock, which is your penance.  Well, I think...  I think the professional lighter, lighting guy, wanted to make sure you were lit up nice.  He cares about you.  You do look darling under this light.  See, we can't argue with the guy.  He's a professional.  He is a professional.  That's true.  This is what he thought should be done.  The lights, you're never supposed to notice.  Do you notice the lights?  Oh, we notice them.  Meaning it's supposed to be...  Do you notice these?  I can't notice them. 
[00:08:00]  My eyes are hurting too much.  There's a giant Czech cereal glowing in the fucking sky.  I feel like a little fucking...  A little piece of wheat floating in a giant bowl.  A nuclear light bright.  It's very bright.  It is very bright.  Well, maybe they'll be better when we get the filters today.  Oh, you are getting filters?  Yes.  Oh, okay.  Then the problem is they adjusted all these lights.  So when you turn these lights off, then these look weird.  Yeah, could you turn that one down?  Or turn that one off?  You want that one off?  Yeah.  See, if that one's off...  I just want something on my face.  That was about five minutes of getting used to it. 
[00:08:30]  But if that one's off, then it messes up the rest of them.  No, it's the way it looks like.  This is a very sensitive environment.  You can't turn off any of these lights.  I just don't like it in my face.  You can't throw out the balance.  Yeah.  But then we can't...  Like, then we can't shoot any of it.  See, no.  Oh, boy.  No.  Oh, boy.  What?  What happened?  Travis, stop knocking water over.  Travis, did you fall down and go boom?  Yeah.  Now I'm dark over here.  No, we got to turn this back on.  Yeah.  And now you're in the dark.  I don't want you to touch that light.  I can't see Opie.  What happened?  Oh, you're not allowed to touch it. 
[00:09:00]  The red button.  Red button.  We have to touch it.  Blinded by the light.  It has to.  Or then I have to move these downward.  I need like six of these.  But then that's going to mess up everything for my studio.  Anthony loves these lights.  I really do.  I need these.  I'm not saying they're bad lights, but the way the one's positioned is right in my face.  Just make believe it's diarrhea.  You'll love it.  Well, I think your problem is that it's positioned towards the interview subject.  The guests are going to hate that when they're talking if a light's in their face.  I've never done a TV interview where I was looking... 
[00:09:30]  Again, I know it's not a TV studio, but there's a way to light it where...  Oh, boy.  But I don't care about the lights.  I like the idea.  We'll just get Opie and Anthony sunglasses, hand them to the guests.  They'll put them on.  They'll put them on and wear it.  And we get some branding.  And then we could sell them as merch.  Would we let the guests keep them?  Yes.  That way they could wear them around.  As long as they signed away with it.  I like it.  Yeah.  That's going to be expensive.  Now, they're probably going to start working on it.  Oh, your sunglasses.  We're working on that right now. 
[00:10:00]  No, I was a joke.  But the way they'll do it is they'll put a giant O and a giant A over the eye part  like they did with these stickers.  Oh, yeah.  The sticker debacle.  Oh, I forgot about the stickers.  The sticker debacle.  Those are all gone, huh?  Yeah.  Well, we left one.  Whatever.  I understand.  They're trying to...  Can I move one of these?  For real?  I'd be so upset if you move something.  No, because they set it up perfectly.  My eyes are light sensitive.  Since my fucking eyes are...  So are mine.  I got these fucking beautiful blue eyes.  I'd say, Jesus Christ, I love seeing them. 
[00:10:30]  And the fucking sun and these bright lights hurt.  Yeah.  Mars was about to move the lights this morning.  And Travis wouldn't let him.  And he ran out of the office and said, those lights are not there for you to move them.  Travis doesn't want anyone touching the light.  The lighting guy moved the track lighting the way that it should be.  There's not as much shadows, which is important when you're doing a TV shoot.  Yeah, these aren't shadowy.  I like this.  They're not that shadowy.  Lighting guys are amazing.  When you watch a TV show, nobody ever thinks, why are there no shadows? 
[00:11:00]  What is this, the Vampire Chronicles?  Nobody has a fucking shadow.  I couldn't believe how much this guy knew about lights.  It's like, enough about your lights.  Yeah, we get it bright.  We see everything.  Oh, you can read.  He was just listing shit you can do.  You can read by him.  You can eat next to him.  You can see.  If you drop marbles, well, thanks to the lights, you'll find your marbles.  Let's move the track lighting next now.  We're almost done.  We're almost done.  We are.  We're almost done.  We're getting there.  I like that.  Now we've got to move the tracks to the walls.  And we've got to knock this studio out next to us and just take over both studios. 
[00:11:30]  Don't laugh.  That has to happen if we stay here.  We need a much bigger fucking studio.  And all we have to do is take this wall down.  Jimmy's right.  You don't want to be in the same room as Eric.  It doesn't matter.  Just shove him in the corner.  It can't be.  Shove him around the corner.  Whatever.  Enough about the lights.  Do you want that one off again?  No, we can't.  We can't.  Because then they all have to go off. 
[00:12:00]  And then I turn these and then that's going to be a problem.  Lighting for video isn't that hard.  I'm like, fish man.  Shut the fuck up.  Everybody's got to get into the act.  Shut up.  We've been trying this for a year.  I think it looks good.  It does look fine.  I just don't like any light in my face.  It drives me nuts.  Tebow's in town.  Landed yesterday.  What's the headline over there?  I catch the train.  Oh, sorry.  I just keep thinking of light things.  What's the headline over there on the Tebow?  Halo, New York. 
[00:12:30]  Halo, New York.  Halo, New York.  I get it.  Tebow arrives.  And he's waving.  I get it.  To his massive fan base.  Hi.  That's what that wave says.  Oh, boy.  Does it ever.  Hi.  I think it's a masculine wave.  Yeah.  No.  It looks like Grace Kelly.  The way he went.  Hi.  Halo, New York.  Yeah.  And exactly what we've been saying for the last couple of days.  The headline in our paper today. 
[00:13:00]  Tebow here to be number one quarterback.  And then you go to the sports section.  Their headline.  Sources say Tebow has eye on Sanchez's job.  Watch out, Mark.  That's exactly what we've been saying for the last few days.  That's all the sports writers.  Tebow probably said nothing of the kind.  It's just a scumbag sports drama.  But we all knew this is what they were going to do with this whole thing.  And knowing that Sanchez is a bit sensitive.  Maybe Mark Sanchez is the source.  Watch out, Mark.  It says on the back.  Really?  You think this guy needs this shit?  And this is what we were questioning. 
[00:13:30]  Is Mark Sanchez ready for all this shit?  Whether it comes from Tebow or the sports writers.  They're going to go with this angle.  Everyone wants Tebow to start now.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Why not?  But yeah, they got him.  Might as well.  Throw him in.  See what happens.  Mark Sanchez is so good.  I think Mark Sanchez fundamentally is a better quarterback, but...  He's not good enough for everybody to go, well, obviously Tebow's not going to...  Yeah.  Well, obviously Tebow's back up and you can't put him in because it's not like Brady's 
[00:14:00]  there or something, you know, and you're like, all right, let's replace him.  Sanchez is like, well...  It's kind of like, well, we could give it a shot.  But the sports writers are already all about this.  They love making the drama, the drama.  And that's going to put some pressure and some stress and some anxiety in Sanchez's head.  More.  This is great for him.  They got something to write about.  Maybe it'll get his ass in gear.  Maybe it'll get even better.  Where did Tebow go yesterday when he came to New York?  Church.  Went to St. Pat's.  You're kidding.  Yeah. 
[00:14:30]  I don't know.  I know.  Neither do I.  Sounds logical.  It does.  Probably hit 10 churches already, this guy.  Yeah.  Got to find a good parish.  Got to find a good parish.  I don't know.  What did he do?  Yeah.  What was his first little day in New York?  What did he do?  I'm assuming he was in to do contract stuff.  Is he coming in here on Sirius XM Studios?  I hope so.  I'm sure he got some to do.  NFL channel.  Did you guys get the Pat Robertson?  Pat Robertson.  Pat Robertson clip on Tebow. 
[00:15:00]  Holy rollout.  And Peyton Manning?  No.  They just threw it on the TV.  On the TV.  Yeah.  He's hoping that Denver has a shitty year because they got rid of Tebow.  Because, you know, Pat Robertson's all about that God thing.  That God thing.  He's all about football, really.  I mean, synonymous with football.  So why doesn't fucking God do Tim Tebow's deal?  Yeah.  Pat Robertson's a dick.  He really is.  He's just a dope.  He's the fucking worst.  But he still has an audience.  Oh, he always will. 
[00:15:30]  He still has the audience.  Them holy rollers.  People actually go to these arena sermons.  Oh, that's amazing.  I mean, you get so used to the idea that this is such nonsense, but you forget that there's  a lot of people that really, really believe that stuff.  They shut their eyes.  They lean their head back.  And they put their arms up.  And they rock back and forth.  And it's like, wow, you're a fucking psychopath.  And I kind of fluctuate between hating them for their dumbness and feeling for them.  Like, you really think that this douchebag is helping you?  This jerk off in the front of this arena? 
[00:16:00]  Yeah.  You want to have some faith and that whole thing.  Yeah, faith is fine.  That's fine.  Whatever you want to do.  But to think that this fucking old money-grubbing fuck is doing any favors for you with God.  What do you need a middleman for?  You don't.  What the fuck do you need some human middleman to get your word to God?  Talk to him directly, right?  Yeah.  He talks to me, too.  I get emails from him.  I follow him on Twitter.  He's God at Yahoo.  Actually, it's God 232. 
[00:16:30]  He couldn't get God.  Some fucking idiot in Chicago has it.  Yeah.  He's in the middle of a fucking copyright thing.  But he realizes he never copyrighted God.  I can't believe I forgot that.  Is this the clip?  I don't know.  Uh-oh.  Sam yelled at you a little bit right there.  I don't know.  Hold on.  Whatever.  Hold on?  Really, Sam?  Really?  Things are changing right here.  Hold on.  Yeah, whatever.  Hey, listeners, hold on.  Sam's busy.  Whatever, Sam.  Yes.  Whatever, Sam. 
[00:17:00]  I think I saw a guy die yesterday, so I'm a little fucked up today anyway.  In our neighborhood, too, there, Jimmy.  Oh, good.  I can name a couple people I hope it was.  No kidding.  How do we find out if the guy made it?  I need to know if this guy made it.  That's all.  We don't have to talk about it too long on the show.  I actually tweeted the wrong address.  It was 67th and Columbus.  But for some reason, I tweeted 67th and Broadway.  There was a guy down, and they were working on him hard, like aggressive CPR, an overweight 
[00:17:30]  guy.  I couldn't tell how old he was.  And they didn't have a pulse for the whole time I was there, which was at least 10 minutes.  And then finally, a lady said, we got a pulse.  And then they kind of bagged him and got him together.  But he was still unconscious when they took him away.  I just need to know if the guy made it.  How do we find that out?  Why are you compelled to know?  Because I don't know.  Did I see a guy die yesterday?  Well, why do you want to know?  I don't know. 
[00:18:00]  You don't know why you want to know?  Well, because I saw the wife, and it looked like a wife and a kid.  They're just horrified.  And I just want to know if he did all right.  Maybe you...  How do you find shit like this out?  Assume he did, and then you can go along your merry way.  That's you.  Make it go away.  Make it go away.  I just need to know.  It was well over 100 people just, like, dead, silent, watching the EMTs, like, work their balls off.  I thought I walked on a movie set. 
[00:18:30]  This is great.  Opie's Stealing Club Soda Kenny's Pit.  Which one?  Just the doom and gloom.  But what am I going to do?  I walked upon this yesterday.  I didn't search this out.  I was just minding my own... </pre>
