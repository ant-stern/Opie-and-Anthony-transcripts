<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often shifting rapidly between segments and caller interactions.  The show opened with Anthony detailing his recent, financially devastating divorce, revealing his ex-wife emptied their joint account, leaving him with only $42.  He lamented the perceived unfairness of divorce laws, alongside humorous anecdotes about his disastrous morning commute in his girlfriend's car (featuring inescapable Gwen Stefani music) and a subsequent gas station mishap.  His extreme dislike of children was a recurring theme, fueled by stories involving his girlfriend's family and a child's booger-on-the-couch incident that resulted in the couch's disposal.  Listener calls, promotional material for XM Satellite Radio, and contributions from E-Rock, Danny, Nathaniel, and Travis punctuated this segment.

The show then transitioned into a chaotic mix of segments.  Nonsensical chatter between Opie and Anthony led to brief calls from Tom in Philly and Mike in Kansas, the latter featuring a humorous booger-in-the-couch anecdote mirroring Anthony's earlier story.  A listener-submitted song parody, using homophobic slurs, mocked Martini Steve and his hybrid car.  This was followed by a segment where the hosts and a studio guest, Steve, cleaned up listener-submitted audio clips for television broadcast, replacing profanity with euphemisms and altering lines for comedic effect.  The original and cleaned-up versions of these extremely vulgar clips (containing graphic sexual references and homophobic slurs) were played.  A clip from a 1950s film warning about pornography's effects on youth was satirized with crude jokes.  Regis Philbin's singing career became a target for crude, sexually explicit improvisational lyrics.  Calls from Krista (a blind listener) and Jay in Cleveland (who was subjected to intense homophobic ribbing) followed.  The segment concluded with a vulgar negotiation with Patty, a listener who'd sent disliked Christmas presents, resulting in Patty flashing her underwear on air for additional payment after the hosts sold her gifts on eBay for $770.

A "Let's Make a Deal" game with Patty saw her win $770 for a series of increasingly bizarre challenges involving nudity, a Crusty the Clown mask, a tarp, apples, KY jelly, and a "cherry dart" game.  Several interns witnessed Patty's naked crawl across the studio.  Opie shared stories about a near-fire incident caused by "java logs" and a low-blood-sugar meltdown requiring milk retrieval from a Dwayne Reed store by Ricky, greatly amusing Anthony. The show then played listener-submitted remixes of Pat O’Brien’s leaked sexually explicit voicemails, detailing the scandal, including alleged derogatory comments towards a coworker and flirtation attempts with Oprah Winfrey. This segment also featured a drunken on-air appearance by Frankie Blue (program director of WNEW), highlighting his incoherence and unprofessional behavior, ultimately ending with audio of his firing.

A caller recounted explicit childhood sexual experiences, including encounters with overweight women and a developmentally disabled girl, described with offensive language. This was followed by a highly critical and vulgar discussion of Tara Reid's "Taradice" travel show, featuring impressions and commentary on Reid's appearance and speech, punctuated by audio clips. Comedian Bob Kelly was a guest during this segment.

The "Bombs and Flubs" segment highlighted Jimmy Norton's failed jokes (including those about Y2K, sex with an elderly woman, and sex with a paralyzed woman), while Anthony Cumia had no flubs.  Past flubs were also reviewed, along with a call from John and Al, creators of a *Silence of the Lambs* parody musical.  Howie Mandel’s potty-training anecdote involving a ravine and urination was recounted, along with a news story about an 86-year-old woman repeatedly calling 911 about pizza delivery, featuring Dee Dee's distinctive accent.  Debbie Gibson's and Tiffany's Playboy spreads were compared, and a caller shared a story about stealing and viewing porn from vending machines in a tree fort.

A rambling discussion with Jimmy Robinson included childhood reminiscences (building tree forts and attempting to form the disastrously named "The Lords" gang), explicit discussions about pornography, and Jimmy's injury from a falling studio panel.  A heated exchange with "Dragon Wagon," a long-haul trucker offended by the show's content, ensued.  Bernie, an in-studio guest with *Weekly World News*, became upset when Opie switched his CD, briefly leaving the studio.

Bernie’s subsequent enraged departure, compared to Dustin Hoffman in *Rain Man*, was followed by a call with comedian Rich Voss, who recounted answering a phone call from his girlfriend mid-comedy performance, leading to teasing about his being "pussy-whipped." A guest’s visit, resulting in broken poker chips and a hat box, caused a further upset departure, met with laughter from the hosts. Billy Burr was mentioned as a guest, but didn’t feature in this specific segment.  Joe Rogan’s material was previewed.

A segment featured hockey highlights, a listener-submitted volatile father-son argument filled with profanity, and Big A's flawed karaoke performances of "Waiting for a Girl Like You" and "Brown Eyed Girl."  A phone call from Bob Kelly and a highly profane remote with John Valby at Steinway piano headquarters, resulting in uncomfortable interactions with staff, were also included.  A "terror tape" was briefly discussed.

The show discussed old, racist cigarette commercials (featuring the Flintstones), classic cartoons, and Opie's smoking habits (following a call from Peter from WhackBag.com).  The hosts’ racist and sexist commentary accompanied the playing of vintage cigarette ads.  A call from John from Jersey offered compliments.  A bizarre event involving "Tippi Tom," a sleeping homeless man outside the studio, resulted in a chaotic and profanity-laced interaction.  Celine Dion's post-Hurricane Katrina appearance on Larry King Live was mocked with offensive jokes.

The show covered the Discovery Channel's "Deadliest Catch," described as a "crab holocaust," with an extended playing of Gordon Lightfoot's "The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald."  A caller who was a commercial fisherman defended the crab fishermen.  A prank call segment targeting the Tony Danza Show, featuring Anthony's Tony Danza impression, resulted in explicit promises and a team member's arrest for disorderly conduct.

A post-interview discussion about Eric's cell phone being knocked from his hand during an interview, possibly due to mistaken identity with Z100, was followed by a visit from Bob Saget, who recounted crude and sexually explicit anecdotes.  A caller criticized Dave Coulier, prompting Saget’s defense.  Charles Ross, a one-man Star Wars show performer, had a disrupted interview due to inappropriate calls from "Steve from Yellowstone," ultimately leaving before the interview concluded.

A call-in segment with Charles, discussing Star Wars and his One Man Lord of the Rings show, was punctuated by numerous calls from Steve, who repeatedly shouted "Ramone!" and made offensive statements.  Other callers praised Charles's knowledge or participated in the "Ramone" calls.  An excerpt from Charles’s show and a promotion for a "best of" compilation concluded the segment.

[00:01:30]  hey, we don't all sound that dumb,  number five,  a couple was in a vestibule at St. Pat's, doing ass sex, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, sounds great,  ehh, complete whores, Opie and Anthony got this couple to have sex in New York's St. Patrick's Cathedral,  immigration against the church is disrespectful, it's a true sacrilege, it was just a joke,  Opie's fault again, how can we blow up our lives today, you rocking sex, 
[00:02:00]  Opie, Opie, Opie, Opie, Opie, Opie, Opie, Opie, Opie, Opie, Opie, Opie, Opie, Opie, Opie, Opie, Opie.  Uh oh, we're in it again.  They hire people who are artists to do a certain thing,  and then when they go too far,  they suddenly wash the hands of them if they feel the heat is too heavy.  Opie and Anthony should not have been fired.  Technically, we did get fired.  They probably shouldn't have hired them in the first place.  Exiled radio hosts.  They had been fired in Boston after announcing that the mayor was killed, another prank.  And I go, Anthony, I got a great idea today. 
[00:02:30]  We're going to tell the whole city of Boston that the mayor died in a fiery car,  crashed while he was on vacation in Florida.  What do you think?  Oh, my God.  Is this a bad one?  Oh, it just gets worse and worse.  Everything just went right down the crapper.  Can I just say fuck?  Yeah.  The duo signed on with XM Satellite Radio.  Thank God.  Yeah, we'll make it work.  Oh, what a glorious day.  It's all about me.  I play golf with old guys.  I am a grinning idiot.  Act, act, act. 
[00:03:00]  Hey, it's Romy and Anthony.  We're back now with a new clap of the radio.  Ho, ho, Opie.  Shut up!  Thank you.  You don't go to CNN for dick jokes.  Don't come to ONA for hard-hitting news.  I don't know.  Your mom's box.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  We stink.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Hi, this is Nathaniel from The Opie and Anthony Show.  This next bit is when Anthony talks about how great marriage is and how it's a blessed institution 
[00:03:30]  and how with some hard work and elbow grease, it can really work for you.  Here it is.  Let me take you on a little journey of my own, Opie, through my divorce.  Remember?  Oh, boy.  Remember, which is another battle.  I'm going to take a break now.  Remember when I was first going through it?  This is how I got uncomfortable.  We were working at N.E.W. for a short period of time, not making too much money, to tell you the truth, to be honest with you. 
[00:04:00]  They brought us on board at a budget, and I go into divorce proceedings with that earning.  Well, Dominic Barbera, like President Bush, extended the divorce proceedings all the way through my contract negotiations, which was two years later,  and all the way through up until I signed a new deal.  That deal that everyone talked about, because it was a very attractive deal. 
[00:04:30]  He knew how to extend the battle to his advantage.  What?  You think it's still in my head?  You think I still mull that over on a daily friggin' basis?  It's the only time I get uncomfortable.  Well, that's what Bush did.  He extended it right through the election.  Learned from his daddy.  All right.  Oh, we're done with the speeches?  Yeah.  Why do you have to keep paying?  You shouldn't have to keep paying. 
[00:05:00]  You've been divorced for a while.  It looks like it should be over, maybe for a year or so.  Huh?  What?  Who?  Just in general.  Really?  Yeah.  Huh.  He's been separated and divorced for, I don't even know, like six years now.  About six years.  He's still paying.  How long are you supposed to pay alimony for?  How many years?  That's all sorted out.  In a general, is there really a time limit for people?  No.  See, the more money you make or have, the longer you'll pay.  That's pretty much how it works.  There's no rule of thumb.  No.  Except the thumb I want to plunge into my eyeball every time I think about it. 
[00:05:30]  But wait, women can just go out and get a new job and stuff like that and have their  own rent and they're still going to collect a check.  Exactly.  For doing...  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  And they're not even obligated to give up the box anymore?  There you go.  Alimony wouldn't be so bad if you still have the right.  If you could take the drive over with no notice.  Yeah.  Pull out your mule and go, it looks a little dry, doesn't it?  And she's got to go, good point, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  There you go.  And then you glue the check to her forehead.  That's the way for all couples. 
[00:06:00]  Wow, they spit on the forehead and slap the check on there.  The guy just gets screwed in all that.  Yeah.  Of course he does.  It's unbelievable.  But then the women out there want to be looked at as equals.  Of course they do.  You want to be an equal?  When a divorce happens, you go your separate ways.  You go get a job, whatever, and the guy goes and continues what he's doing.  Especially if there's no kids.  You split the bank account down the middle.  See, you don't go to the bank and withdraw all the money out of the bank.  No.  You don't go to the bank. 
[00:06:30]  Can I?  All right.  All right.  We're going there?  Because I was with you that day, and I got to tell you, it was the funniest and saddest  day I've ever spent with Anthony.  Oh, my God.  The funniest and saddest day.  I was in shock.  Anthony and I are doing this radio show, and all hell is going on behind the scenes with  his personal life.  Oh, my God.  And it's getting very obvious that there was going to be lawyers involved and stuff.  So I look at Anthony one day as we're getting ready for the show, literally a half hour before  the show, and I go, how much money you got in your bank account, that joint account of 
[00:07:00]  yours?  And what was it, honestly?  It was, Opie, it was every penny I had saved in my entire life.  Right.  At that point in my life, it was every cent I had saved in my whole life, and it was a  grand total of 40 large.  40,000.  40 Gs.  So I go to, how much?  Which was, you know, for me, especially since up until, you know, a few years before that,  before I even got into radio, before I came to NEW, I had, like, nothing.  I was working for a living with, you know, if I can keep 1,200 bucks in my bank account, 
[00:07:30]  it was a miracle.  You know what's so pathetic?  We kicked ass in Boston, and we both came home with barely bank accounts.  Yeah, I had nothing.  I had, like, maybe 30,000, 40,000 as well.  That job gave me the privilege of paying off some credit card debt.  That was pretty much it, and not even all the credit card debt.  We came to New York with really not much money in the bank and stuff, so I'm looking at Anthony,  I'm like, how much money is in that joint account of yours, you know?  And he's like, I don't know, about 40,000.  I'm like, dude, you know, she's getting lawyers involved, it looks like.  Why don't we go to the bank? 
[00:08:00]  This is a true story.  I was the one who told you.  I go, why don't we go to the bank, and why don't you take some of that money out?  And you being the good guy, I swear this is the truth.  And he goes, you know what?  I will go, and I'm going to take half the money out.  I'm going to take 20 grand.  I figured I'm going to go and take 20 grand out.  Because I'm a good guy.  I'm going to take half out and leave the other half for her.  Yeah.  You know?  Oh, I get there, I write out my little withdrawal slip.  It was so funny and so sad.  And I'm sitting there as Ant's doing the withdrawal slip and stuff.  $20,000 withdrawal. 
[00:08:30]  Here's my account number.  Let me get my ID.  I walk up to the counter.  Hello.  How are you today?  Give it a little slip.  Does some typing.  Looks at the monitor.  I'm there, you know, clearing out some spots in my wallet.  Well, I mean, it's going to be a hell of a wad.  I better figure out if you want it in large bills or maybe a check.  Can you see where this is headed?  Right.  Is there any mystery left in this story?  I'm sorry, Mr. Kumia.  There seems to be $42 in your account. 
[00:09:00]  She took $40,000.  She took the $40,000.  Before they even started negotiating the divorce.  The whole thing.  The whole wad.  How does that happen?  How does the judge not go, all right, well, where's 20 of that money?  Not only does that happen, but then you have to go to court, and then they have to tell  you how much out of, now, the pay that you're getting, that money's gone.  Now I have to re-save and try to build up my account again, but out of the money that 
[00:09:30]  I'm making, money's got to come out of that to go to her, as like support payments, they  call it.  And that's what you've got to go through.  Not only did I take your $40,000, but I'm going to have to pay out of your paycheck.  This is what happens to a man in a divorce.  They get screwed over, it's an amazing thing that you have to go through.  It's amazing.  And there are options to that, and sometimes some guys don't want to get raked over the  coals, so they figure, well, maybe a rowboat and an anchor, and a little fishing expedition. 
[00:10:00]  Is that Chris Rocksbit?  Oh yeah, you understand.  I understand.  I wouldn't kill it, but I understand.  But I understand.  Talking about O.J. Simpson.  So Jim, I'm sitting in the bank, and I know what's going on just from the body language.  I start laughing harder than I've ever laughed.  Oh, he's laughing at me.  But inside, inside, and then I've got to be there for my pal.  I'm out 40 G's.  And then I look at him, and then I was really sad for him.  But I started laughing, and then I'm like, oh my God, I cannot believe what was going on.  You know what I looked like when we were walking back to the studio?  He didn't even have money for lunch. 
[00:10:30]  And we're becoming big radio stars in New York.  At that point, Anthony had absolutely no money to his name except what he had in his wallet,  which I don't think he had much of the other day.  Let me give you a visual of what I looked like walking back.  Picture the scene in Jaws where Sheriff Brody is trying to get the mayor to sign that paper  after the last shark attack.  And the mayor's like, my son was in that water too.  Just sign it.  Close the beaches.  But I, beaches are all, I was doing it for the citizens. 
[00:11:00]  I was kidding.  We could go.  That was me.  I was gone.  I was, okay, I had 40, I was kidding.  We've got to go.  I can't do a show.  We could go old school.  You look like Dr. Bellows.  Dr. Bellows.  Remember Dr. Bellows from I Dream of Jeannie?  Yeah.  Whenever he would always see Jeannie appear or disappear, and Tony was trying to explain to  him what happened, and he's like, but, and then I looked, and there was a woman.  And then when I came, she was gone, but the box was in, and all of a sudden, but, and 
[00:11:30]  you came in, and, but that was gone, and I, that was me.  Just confusion.  Oh, it was awful.  I had no clue what to do.  None.  The best part about that whole thing was when she was claiming that she made you a radio  star.  What?  That she had something to do with it.  It, it, once you get into court.  It was amazing.  Once you get into court when you're divorced, getting a divorce, the lawyer for the wife  will always...  I had to hand over old tapes of our shows at BAB, because she was trying to prove that 
[00:12:00]  she helped Anthony's career.  They try to get what's called future earnings.  Ah.  So what the lawyer will do is say, ah, all right, your, your earning potential for the  rest of your life is X amount of dollars, and she has a right to some of that money.  So they will give a percentage to her based on what you might earn in the future.  And you've got to pay that.  That's why I, you know, decided to settle.  And, ah, that's what happened.  But they, how are they going to screw you? 
[00:12:30]  And I'm trying to say, look, I might not make a dime.  You know, I might be, do something stupid on our show and get fired.  That's exactly what happened.  You know?  So, it's, the laws for divorce are so screwed.  Yep.  So many guys get raked over the coals.  I'm lucky because, you know, yeah, it costs me a lot of money, but at least I make a good  wage, you know?  It's not like I'm, I'm the guy making, you know, $30,000 and you got to give a half.  Now you're living on $15,000, you know? 
[00:13:00]  That's pretty rough.  That is really rough.  But that, for some reason, yeah, we want to be equals.  I, I don't want the corporate glass ceiling.  I want to make as much, you know?  We want to be respected in the corporate world.  We want this, that.  You want it?  Then, then, then, no more divorce laws that are against the guys.  All the time.  What?  Huh?  What?  It gets a little uncomfortable.  They don't contribute creatively ever. 
[00:13:30]  Here's what they should say in court.  How big is his bag?  All right, you drained it a little bit.  That's what you contributed to the relationship.  There you go.  Weigh my bag.  You're a bag drainer.  All women are bag drainers.  Another scene out of Jaws.  Quint, I'll never get married again.  It's like putting on that life jacket.  After you're swimming around, watching people get plucked off.  He bobbed up and down and then turned over.  He was bitten in half at the waist.  His wife did it. 
[00:14:00]  Took half the son of a bitch.  I'll never get married again.  Paycheck goes in the water.  Wife's in the water.  My wife.  Farewell and ado to half of your pay.  Awful.  Yeah.  Here she comes.  Look out.  We're going to need a bigger paycheck. 
[00:14:30]  I don't want to open the shark and have that settlement spill out all over the dock.  Oh, brother.  And you will pay that alibi.  Oh, God damn.  Yeah.  Wow.  Dragged me under like that little Kittner boy.  I'll say. 
[00:15:00]  All right.  What do we got next, man?  She can't stay down with three alimony checks in her pocket.  Wife came in looking for my check with black eyes, lifeless eyes like a doll's eyes.  Hear that horrible high-pitched screaming and hollering as she takes your check.  Everyone just keeps pounding, pounding. 
[00:15:30]  Sometimes she goes away.  Sometimes she don't go away.  Just hear that pounding and horrible high-pitched screaming.  Come in and tear your paycheck to pieces.  Wow.  It's August 2002.  Let's drink to your lawyer.  Let's drink to my lawyer.  All of a sudden, Okie Bar, Boston, fat lawyer come in, grab my paycheck, pour it out of my pocket. 
[00:16:00]  Check this out.  Steve from New Hampshire.  Guys definitely get screwed in a divorce.  F yeah.  Get this.  My wife left me for the lesbian next door.  That's a camp story.  And somehow in New Hampshire, when that happens, it's not considered adultery.  Can you imagine if I did the same thing?  Wow.  If you leave for a lesbian next door, it's not adultery?  In New Hampshire, I guess.  If you're a chick.  Ah, there.  All right.  Good luck to you.  Yeah, sure.  We'll continue in just a bit here.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:16:30]  Hey, it's Travis from The Opie and Anthony Show, and you are listening to the best bits  since coming to XM.  Up next is Anthony's bad day driving to work.  Anthony had to take his girlfriend's car into work, and apparently she's a big fan of Gwen  Stefani, and Anthony did not know how to get Gwen Stefani off the radio.  And as E-Rock would say, hilarity ensues.  Check it out on The Opie and Anthony Show.  I got a call from Anthony around, I don't know.  I'm not your keeper, by the way.  I just like informing people if I'm going to be a little tardy to the show, and you're 
[00:17:00]  the only number I have.  It was very, very nice, actually.  But anyway, I get a call from you around 5, 5, 10.  I don't even know that you're going to be late.  Yeah.  And then...  An angry phone call from a gas pump in Queens.  Oh.  And it's 12 degrees out.  It's not a morning to pump gas.  I have things set up the way I like things.  It's not a morning to leave the house here in New York.  This would have been a great day to call in sick. 
[00:17:30]  You know, living my life the way I do, and have in the past, and where I've gotten in  life, doing what I do, I've earned certain things, I believe.  I worked hard for living for many years, Opie, in the construction industry.  All right, you're scaring me, because we've never worked hard in radio.  No, no, no.  This is the dream job.  We haven't earned crap.  No, no.  I just mean life in general.  That's why I didn't say in this career.  We just happen to have a really good chemistry that's, I don't know, and it's working. 
[00:18:00]  Right.  But we haven't worked hard at this.  No, no.  Not at all.  I mean, in life in general, me, myself, I have worked.  I had a real job, you know?  I was doing construction.  I was in this type of cold, frigid weather, where a house is nothing but two by fours,  and you've got to put in duct work, and it's freezing cold, and you don't want to be there,  and you're humping stuff, and there's ice, and it stinks. 
[00:18:30]  And I did that.  But you know something?  Throughout life, I have been afforded certain things, and now I just don't have to deal  with certain things, one of which is pumping gas in the freezing cold.  I don't like doing it.  So what I do is I keep my car garaged, make sure it's full of gas, and then when I leave,  I don't even have to deal with the outside world, only the little walk that I take to  the studio.  That's the only time you're outside all day? 
[00:19:00]  Pretty much.  Yeah, because, all right, so your car gets warmed up for you, right, while you're getting  dressed?  Well, it's in the garage.  But do you have one of those automatic...  No.  The garage is, like, heated.  Oh, all right.  I got you.  So I get in.  Look at you with a heated garage.  Like I said, I have certain things that I have now that I never dreamt I would have,  and that's one of them.  How do you get gas?  Like on the way home or something.  It's not, you know, I don't need it balmy.  I don't have to drive to the Caribbean to fuel up. 
[00:19:30]  But, you know, the sun on you is one thing.  But when it's 4 in the morning, 4.30 in the morning, and it's 5 degrees out, it's just  cold.  Are we looking at a garage diva here?  Garage diva.  How warm do you keep your garage?  It's not, like, heated where there's a vent in there, but, like, the water heater and stuff  is in the garage.  So it's warm enough.  So it's warm enough, you know.  It's, like, probably, it's probably, I don't know, almost 60 degrees in there, which is  fine.  You know, and then you turn your heat on.  Very nice.  I enjoy the warmth. 
[00:20:00]  And, well, let's just say I have some company over the house.  There seems to be a family emergency with my girlfriend, my girlfriend's family, and her  sister and husband are down and staying at my place.  And they also have kids.  There's two boys and a little infant-type baby girl.  Can I preface this?  Yes.  For the new listeners.  Yes.  Anthony absolutely hates kids. 
[00:20:30]  I know ands, ifs, or buts about it.  Anthony cannot stand kids.  You know what the extent of kids is in my life that I enjoy?  If you see one being pushed in a carriage or something and you go, oh, goo-goo-doo-doo-goo,  and then walk away.  I could appreciate...  Do you actually do the goo-goo-goo-goo-goo?  No, I think it.  Oh.  Because I don't think anyone actually...  No, no one does that.  Okay.  It's...  Do you have a rattle in the back pocket where you just want to see kids? 
[00:21:00]  I try to make believe they're not there, is what I do.  That's it.  And they're staying over.  And, well, this morning, their vehicle was in my driveway behind my...  My garage door.  So I could not get my...  Truck.  My truck out.  Like, you know, I get in, it's warm.  So I had to take my girlfriend's vehicle, which is out in the driveway in the freezing cold. 
[00:21:30]  By the way, there's a trucker checking in from Minnesota.  Yeah.  Pretty much saying, stop bitching about 12 degrees in New York.  It's a negative 48 in Minnesota.  That's why I don't live in that frozen tundra.  Ugh.  Minnesota.  No.  12 is cold enough.  It's plenty cold.  After 12, 12, 48 below...  Does it matter?  Does it really matter?  So I get in the girlfriend's vehicle.  And I have no idea how anything works in it.  And it's pitch black.  And I can't even...  I can't figure anything out. 
[00:22:00]  And I'm trying to drive now.  It's freezing cold in there before it heats up.  And I can't figure out the radio.  So, like, Gwen Stefani is just blasting.  And I can't change the...  And I mean blasting.  And it's early in the morning.  And now I can't even...  I can't shut it off.  I can't change the station.  Because now I'm really late.  And I'm driving.  I am freaking out.  I can't adjust the mirrors.  I don't even know how to adjust the mirrors.  So I can't see anything behind me. 
[00:22:30]  I'm driving.  Freezing cold.  Loud Gwen Stefani.  Now I'm on the expressway.  You honestly couldn't figure out where the volume controls are?  I couldn't figure out...  It's like...  It's like the glass cockpit of a brand new fighter jet.  There's no knobs.  There's no...  It's all touchscreen, glass screen thing.  Oh, yeah.  This thing is like the future.  I'm surprised it doesn't fly.  Oh, sorry.  Not loud enough.  It was blasting.  And I couldn't turn it down. 
[00:23:00]  And there I am.  Hey, here I am.  Driving down the expressway.  How do I turn this down?  How do I turn it down?  Oh, my God.  I'm freezing.  Oh, stop.  I can't take it.  I'm freezing cold.  One thing I did hear, though.  Who really cares?  Cause if you love you, never know it.  Don't say no.  No fuel. 
[00:23:30]  Oh.  No fuel.  Don't.  Don't.  What?  What?  What?  My mule?  What are you saying, vehicle?  I don't understand you.  No fuel.  No fuel.  I wish I could listen to 1010 wins so I know what's going on for the show.  But I got to hear Gwen Stefani on 11. 
[00:24:00]  Shut up!  Shut up!  Shut up!  This is my drive-in.  Oh, it's only quarter to five in the morning.  I like listening to loud dance music at a quarter to five in the morning.  Stop.  Please stop.  Yeah.  And then, now I have to stop for gas, which is my nightmare early in the morning when it's 12 degrees out. 
[00:24:30]  So, I pull into the gas station.  And, of course, it sounds minor, but have you ever been so livid that anything new thrown into the situation will just freak you out?  Oh, yeah.  Definitely.  I pull in, and, of course, the gas cap's on the opposite side of my vehicle, so now I've got to get back in.  And I've already slid the credit card through, so now I can't just go to the other side.  I've got to kind of U-turn around. 
[00:25:00]  And I go to open up the gas cap, and I have no idea how to open up the gas thing.  And I am now, and I'm just, tick-tock, tick-tock, time is ticking away.  This is show prep time.  Like, I'm picturing everyone sitting here, banhurking at his computer, hoping going through the papers.  Norton's still sleeping, because he's not in until six.  So, my girlfriend gets this call from my cell phone.  She picks up the phone. 
[00:25:30]  Where the fuck's the gas cap?  Release the thing.  Shit.  Oh, baby, I don't know.  I've never fueled it up.  Ah!  I'll find it!  Damn it!  Click.  That was my call to her at about five this morning.  And you know what really ticked me off?  There is no thing. 
[00:26:00]  You just do it with your hand.  Are you serious?  You just pull the flap up with your hand.  But every new vehicle, and mine, has a little thing inside.  They went back to old school.  They went old school on me.  And it threw me for a loop.  So now, I think the only saving grace is it was a self-serve pump with a little thing that keeps the gas flowing.  So you should jump back in the car, right?  So, no, I could just put my hands in my pocket while I called Opie.  Oh, it's me.  I'm putting gas in my car in Queens! 
[00:26:30]  Really?  You thought you'd announce that to me.  I was like, what?  Why are you yelling at me?  Yeah, I'm like, whatever, dude.  All right, we'll be here.  I'm nice and warm.  It's about 80 degrees in our office.  We'll try not to start the show without you.  Yeah.  And I'm just a livid idiot.  Oh, so I was just...  And I got no sleep, really, last night.  Because I got to bed very late.  Kids around the house.  And there's a toddler around there, which just has me, like, freaking out. 
[00:27:00]  Because, Art, my house, I pretty much have...  Yeah, keep them away from the rotating saw blades that I have.  Because the image of a child in this place just never crossed my mind.  You were telling me in the office, three kids running around?  Yeah.  Two little ones and an infant that's just starting to walk?  Two boys that are, I guess, like, six, seven, eight-ish, around there.  This is your hell.  This is your hell on earth.  And a girl who's, like, I guess, one, maybe?  Just, like, just starting to walk, running around my glass coffee table with sharp corners on it. 
[00:27:30]  And then yesterday, I'm on the computer.  And the...  Yeah.  And the parents go, go, oh, come here, come here.  The kid is holding a pair of scissors.  The little one-year-old girl has scissors that I just leave laying around to open up, like, boxes and stuff.  Because it's not childproof.  Here's the kid.  No!  Scissors!  And where was Randy Quaid while all this was going on? 
[00:28:00]  No!  Are you saying it's like vacation?  Was he in the kitchen with his dickie and his little moose cup having some eggnog?  They do live upstate, though.  Took a long trip down here.  You want to put an end to that problem, you ought to hire a fat clown from Chicago to come over and entertain him.  Oh, my God.  And, yeah, so the girl runs around and just finds every single dangerous thing in my apartment, which there are plenty of, you know? 
[00:28:30]  There's two adults living there.  It's very hard to...  You don't baby-proof things, you know?  I got, like, bleach and brandy snifters laying on the floor for some reason, you know?  And I didn't even realize it, but there it is.  I didn't even know that was there until the baby goes to take a swig.  And the boys just like to...  For some reason, boys, at the drop of a hat, just want to run around and go...  All right, we got it. 
[00:29:00]  No, no, no.  Let me do it another half hour.  Then you might start understanding it.  Maybe.  But probably not.  Maybe an hour, two hours.  I just sit on my computer and just... 
[00:29:30]  Then the girl finds this thing that's been stuck to my refrigerator for five years, probably.  It's a little happy birthday cake.  I had no idea what it ever did.  Didn't think it did anything.  Just held postcards on there.  That's all it ever did for five years.  You know what it does when you press the button?  Happy birthday to you.  That's nice.  That's all it does.  That's nice.  You know what happens when you press the button 10,000 times?  Happy birthday to you. 
[00:30:00]  Happy birthday to you.  Happy birthday to you.  Happy birthday to you.  Happy birthday to you.  I've always made it clear I don't want children.  You hate kids.  I never want children.  Don't you have stuff that they can play with?  This is such a cool reminder.  Yeah, scissors.  Whatever they want to grab from an open box or something. 
[00:30:30]  I'm petrified when they run around the house because, like I said, I don't care.  I have just, for no reason at all, I guess about three weeks ago, I took a frayed wire and  just plugged it in the wall and left the two ends just hanging there because I like it.  Apparently, I'd forgotten about it.  You know, kid would come over and grab it.  I don't know what I have in my house.  It's just dangerous.  I know it's dangerous.  You're bringing back your memory because my sister will drop her kid off at my house 
[00:31:00]  every once in a while.  Like, hey, I got a couple errands.  Do you mind watching JD?  I'm like, yeah, no problem, you know?  And then after me and the kid stare at each other, and I love the kid, we stare at each  other for about ten minutes.  And, all right, what do you want to do?  And he's like, you got anything to play with here?  I'm like, didn't mommy give you some toys to play with while she does her errands?  No.  And we're sitting on the couch, and, I mean, you can only have a five-minute conversation  with a five-, six-year-old, right? 
[00:31:30]  I'm like, well, you like video games?  Yeah.  All right, try this.  And this is an old story, but I threw in Grand Theft Auto for him.  Oh, my God.  So then you fast-forward an hour, because now I'm doing my thing, because it's kind of  like, you know, you let the TV babysit the kid, I learned, a long time ago.  Yes.  Whether you throw a cartoon on or Grand Theft Auto, it works.  They're quiet, they're sitting in front of the TV, enjoying themselves, and you can  go do whatever you have to do.  That's pretty much what I wound up doing.  So, you fast-forward a half hour, 40 minutes, and my sister comes in the house and is like, 
[00:32:00]  Greg, what the fuck are you doing?  And I'm like, what?  I come running in the living room, and there's JD.  He figures out how to use the guns and how to pick up prostitutes.  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah.  Playing the game?  Well, because I figured, I gave him the basics.  Like, you know, you jump in this car here.  And drive it around.  Drive around the city a little bit.  It's cool, right?  And I'm thinking a five, six-year-old, he's never going to get past that stage.  I come in, and he's just blowing people away.  Figuring it out.  He's picking up the prostitutes.  He's figured out the whole game.  Oh, man.  And I didn't know this. 
[00:32:30]  And my sister just walks into my house, you know?  And that's what she sees.  And she just starts cursing me out.  I'm like, what?  What are you doing?  Like, next time, maybe, you know, leave toys with him.  I don't know.  Yeah, you just wind up throwing videos in, you know?  We have some videos laying around that they can watch.  You know, here, watch Full Metal Jacket, kid.  What the hell?  Well, that's what I'm saying.  Yeah.  You know, yeah, you got videos, but do you have videos for kids?  Yeah. 
[00:33:00]  You know?  Yeah.  And when you're desperate, you'll be like, ah, that's all right.  How many complete nude scenes are even in this movie?  You know, it's not hardcore stuff.  What the hell?  About time the little fella learned about trannies.  Yeah.  All right.  Pop this in.  Thank you, Yosh.  Yeah.  I love throat pudding, whatever it is.  Yeah.  Throat yogurt.  Throat yogurt.  I don't know.  I'm sure there's a throat pudding also.  Yeah, but it was terribly directed. 
[00:33:30]  A message to Yoshi.  We love you, but enough with the porno.  That's for Opie.  Wow.  I got it.  People love the porno.  I have a stack of porno that he gave us.  I'm only through the first one.  For Norton, continue sending.  Of course.  And for Anthony.  All right.  Well, that's...  Might have more kids dropping by.  Yeah.  Well, that's quite funny, Anthony.  Oh, it's just been, you know, one of those...  I didn't get to sleep last night.  I think about...  I think about 2.30 this morning, I heard, you know... 
[00:34:00]  Oh, man.  From, like, the room, the guest room.  Dude, I didn't...  Am I hearing that?  I didn't get to sleep because...  And actually, I'm going to throw myself under a bus again today, but...  Ben witnessed this firsthand.  I discovered Solitaire on my trio.  You just got a new top-of-the-line computer. 
[00:34:30]  Oh, I know.  And you play Solitaire on your trio.  That's the problem.  These simple games are the ones that are the problems.  Like the Grand Theft Auto San Andreas.  I got it.  Yeah.  Love it.  But I discovered Solitaire on my trio.  I didn't go to bed until I beat the game.  And it took hours.  You get obsessed with these games.  I got OCD when it comes to video games.  I can't put the game down.  I was in the middle of the Jets game this weekend.  Ben came over with a few people, and I'm sitting on the couch playing game after game after game on this trio. 
[00:35:00]  And I get mesmerized, and I cannot put the game down.  Yeah, you're crazy like that.  And I get it in my head, I can't stop playing until I beat the game.  And it's stupid Solitaire.  You can't just shut it off.  Can't shut it off.  Watch the football game.  So around 11.30 last night, I'm usually in bed by 9.  Yeah.  I finally beat the game, and I can go to bed for my five hours.  Because then, you know, you're up at 4 or whatever.  And so it's a horrendous obsession I have with these stupid, simple games. 
[00:35:30]  I need the full-blown graphics.  Oh, yeah.  I love that, too.  But for some reason, that's why I'm tired today.  You're a lonely man.  The stupidest thing.  That's sad.  Do you use your trio with this?  No, I don't.  Do you use your little stylus?  Yeah, I do.  Beep.  Beep.  Over and over and over again.  Like something just keeps clicking in my brain, and I can't turn it off.  Do you chew on your stylus?  No, no, I don't do any of that. 
[00:36:00]  Big, gnarly, chewed-up stylus.  Why don't you just get some real cards?  Oh, there you go.  No, that's too much work.  Too much work.  It's more fun, though.  You need a surface.  Dude, with the trio solitaire, you don't even have to put the cards on the aces.  They do it for you.  Does it all by itself.  The worst is when you play solitaire on the bed, and you kneel, and all the cards kind  of come in towards your leg.  Are you into your knee?  Yeah.  You mess up all the piles.  You actually play the real solitaire?  It's the only way a man does it. 
[00:36:30]  Does anyone play real solitaire anymore?  No, no, no.  I never.  You play chess on the computer?  Yeah, I'd rather play with a person, because the computer is just, for me, unbeatable.  Pretty rough.  You can go online, though, and play with other people online.  That's too creepy.  Yeah, that's creepy online.  If I'm on a computer, it's creepy.  Would you come over and take a leak on me?  Absolutely.  That's not creepy.  I stopped playing chess online.  I told this story, too.  I got into chess again, and I started playing online, you know, because I don't have anyone  around to really play. 
[00:37:00]  Yeah.  So, I'm in, like, kind of a, I don't know, I don't know.  Chess chat room kind of playing?  Yeah, but I'm trying to think, not, like, beginner, kind of, I don't know.  Novice.  Eh, intermediate.  Intermediate.  Somewhere in the chicken hog.  Kind of intermediate, I guess, you know?  And I'm beating these people left and right, and I'm, like, just, I'm thinking I'm, like,  a chess champion again, you know?  Because I used to take it a little, kind of serious when I was, when I was a lot younger.  And then, you know, that stupid chat feature. 
[00:37:30]  Yeah.  Hey, you're pretty good, because I was playing the same person over and over again, but in  general, winning a lot of games.  And this guy goes, hey, you're pretty good.  How old are you?  And I'm, like, well, how old are you?  Uh-oh.  I'm eight.  Eight.  I'm, like, that's it.  I'm effing done.  Because it wasn't like I was totally killing the kid.  I was, you know, I was winning, but, you know, it took a little, some effort.  I'm, like, I'm playing eight-year-olds online.  I'll meet you. 
[00:38:00]  Yeah.  7-Eleven, my treat.  So now I can't admit my real age, because it would be way creepy.  So I'm, like, I'm 15.  Oh.  If you're ever putting I'm 15 into a computer.  Oh, I know.  Turn yourself in.  So I was just, it just got too creepy.  And that was the end of my online chess.  I'm, like, it's all little kids just learning how to play.  Did you drive over his house and give him a T-shirt?  Keep the cop.  So I don't do that anymore.  Jim from the Poconos, go ahead. 
[00:38:30]  Good morning, gentlemen.  Opie, Anthony, you got to do what I do.  When it's time for bed, hey, Uncle Anthony's got to go to bed.  Everybody go to bed.  Oh, I got to be the killjoy.  Time to go to bed.  And, Opie, you either need to get a girlfriend or a hooker because something's going on with you.  All right, thanks, man.  I have a question for Anthony.  Why didn't you, like, this morning, why didn't you just get these people out of bed and say, get the keys and say, move your truck?  I got to go.  You know why?  It just would have taken too long. 
[00:39:00]  I know I was going to be late.  I didn't want to be ridiculously late.  And I can't, you know, I can't depend that someone's going to jump out of bed, just grab whatever's around, and then get in the truck and back it out of the driveway.  Oh, I thought he was just too busy, empty in the septic tank.  No, it's not.  It's not a motor home.  Oh, all right.  I'm still convinced Rainy Quaid's staying at your house.  Are they going to be there for a long time, hopefully?  Stop it.  That means fantastic. 
[00:39:30]  Yeah, I'm hoping because this was the easiest 40 minutes of radio I've done in years.  I don't think so.  I don't think so.  Family, it's important.  Look, I'm fine with them staying there.  I don't have a problem with that.  Really?  It's just certain things that I'm used to and have become accustomed to in my life without children.  You're really fine with that, huh?  Yes.  Okay.  I'm just wondering.  They may listen to the replay later.  Yeah.  Ixnay.  Of course.  I'm fine with it.  It's too bad we didn't have audio rolling in the office about 5 o'clock, 5.15. 
[00:40:00]  I didn't say anything except what I have said on the air, my friend.  No.  I am very...  I'm just trying to cause trouble.  Look, I'm set in my ways, and it's, you know, when I...  Because I had my garage door was going up.  I was in my vehicle.  I started it up.  I put it in reverse, look in the rear view mirror, and there's two headlights staring at me, you know?  So it was kind of like, now it's a big thing.  Because I like just getting in, and then you go. 
[00:40:30]  Now the second I got to shut her down and get out, now there's a problem.  Now there's a problem.  That started my day, that started my day wrong.  Did you have the one moment where you wanted to just open their bedroom door and scream,  get your effing vehicle out of my way?  You're listening to Opie and Anthony's Best Bits Ever.  So don't go anywhere, because there's more.  Unless you need to go and make a duty, then you can go and send for two minutes.  But then you got to come right back.

Leave the fucking studio.  It's the booger couch.  Anthony had some family over.  Some of that family happened to be young kids.  They wiped a booger on his couch.  And Anthony, being the germaphobe that he is, had to throw out the entire couch, which  was fairly new. 
[00:44:00]  It's the booger couch on the best bits of O&A.  At least I was able to get my vehicle out of the garage today.  Oh, that's right.  Yeah.  We need an update on that.  How's the...  Oh, house guests gone.  Out?  They left.  Left last night.  But not before one more little thing happened.  My girlfriend's sister and her husband and three kids were over.  Two boys, about, you know, seven, I guess six, seven, something like that.  And then a girl who's like one year old. 
[00:44:30]  Just figuring out how to walk, right?  A little toddler, just figuring that teetering toddler walk around my sharp-edged furniture  and tile floors.  Like no carpet on some of the floors that I have.  It's just like concrete tile.  Just waiting to go down.  Oh, just waiting to leave a dent in that soft spot.  Just awful.  I have the most dangerous baby house ever.  So, you know, my girlfriend's sister and the younger boy and the girl went shopping, 
[00:45:00]  which left me at the house with the husband and the older boy.  It's like seven years old around there.  And we're watching a movie.  We're all sitting on the couch watching a movie.  And I'm thinking you're thinking that, hey, this isn't too bad.  I'm sitting there.  Not too bad.  I have no idea what you're about to say.  They're not screaming around the house.  I know it's going to be bad.  But you're sitting there maybe enjoying a beer, bonding a little bit with the dude and his older son, right? 
[00:45:30]  You know, I was just watching the movie with them.  Just sitting watching the movie.  No small talk?  No.  You know, I like watching movies.  When a movie's on, I like just watching the movie.  I don't like a lot of talk during movies, to tell you the truth.  I just want to watch.  You have nothing in common with this guy.  No, no.  Hey, man.  I can read between the lines.  You don't have to say a thing, Anthony.  I'm an all-around kind of guy. 
[00:46:00]  I talk to all people.  How long did it take when your girlfriend left with her sister and the two other kids where you realized, uh-oh, I'd better find a movie?  No, actually, he brought in some movies.  Brought in some movies.  All right.  So maybe he's thinking the same thing.  Sure.  You know, just pop a movie in.  Makes things easy.  So we're watching the movie.  And he asks his son, he goes, what are you doing? 
[00:46:30]  So I'm sitting there like, I'm just watching the movie, watching the movie.  He goes, I'm picking my nose.  You know, kids, they don't care.  They'll just say anything.  He goes, I'm picking my nose.  And then I hear, did you wipe that on Anthony's couch?  You're hanging out with Randy Quaid and his kids.  Dude, dude.  Dude.  So they packed up the RV and got out of town.  And the kid goes, yup. 
[00:47:00]  Yup.  What were you honestly thinking inside?  Oh my God.  The kid just wiped the booger on my couch.  Because you hate.  I mean, no one likes that type of thing.  But you absolutely, dude.  You lose your mind.  We have audio of me saying,  snot, besides crap,  snot is the most disgusting thing in life to me.  I can't handle it.  If I blow my nose, I can't look at my own. 
[00:47:30]  I have to be in front of a mirror when I blow my nose to make sure every bit is gone.  You never ate your own booger?  Oh, God damn.  No, never.  See, I just want to get a reaction.  Never, ever, ever.  Not once?  Nope.  Snot has always disgusted me, even as a small child.  I freak out.  I've said it on this show many times.  I can't stand it.  And when he goes, what are you doing?  And the kid goes, pick up my nose.  Did you just wipe a booger on Anthony's couch? 
[00:48:00]  Yup.  And then he goes, well, find it.  So now the kid is searching between the crack and the couch trying to find his booger.  And I'm just, I'm blocked on the movie.  I'm not looking at it.  I'm like, I cannot, I cannot function.  I couldn't believe it.  I couldn't speak. 
[00:48:30]  I'm just watching, I guess it was, yeah, The Day After Tomorrow.  That was the one on.  I thought you were watching.  Or the New York movie.  I thought you were watching Boogie Nights.  Boogie Nights.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  That's zany.  No, it was The Day After Tomorrow.  Yeah.  Yeah.  By the way, never found the booger.  Nice.  So now...  Knowing you, you're going to throw the whole couch out. 
[00:49:00]  Much like Seinfeld.  Yeah, I have to throw my couch out.  I didn't even have to ask.  I know if someone's looking for a really nice couch with one lousy booger in it somewhere...  With a booger somewhere.  We should just give the address of where you're living, and they can come by with a truck and pick it up.  Take it away free of charge.  It's all yours.  I know you, and he's not lying.  Oh, I will have a new couch as soon as possible.  That couch is gone.  Because, first of all, I can sit on it, but I can only sit on an area that's nowhere near the ground zero booger area. 
[00:49:30]  Right.  And as far as laying down and reclining on it, over that crack, you know, the modular crack that it was in...  But do you realize what other stuff is on your couch?  Seriously, have you had people sleep over and stuff?  Uh, yeah.  I got foreign stains on my couch, and I'm like, what the hell are people doing on this couch when they sleep over?  Really?  Oh, my God.  Yeah. 
[00:50:00]  People, you mean couples are sleeping on your couch?  Um...  Because then they are having sex on your couch.  Right, exactly.  And making...  Yeah.  That is probably the rudest thing you can do when staying over some of those, especially sleeping on the couch.  There's a bender over the coffee table or something that could be, you know, clean with some Windex.  And stupid me, I got a very light-colored couch, so everything...  You know, you got a brown couch, eh, do what you want on it, I'll never see it.  Yeah.  But, you know, it's an off-white kind of thing.  Mine's like a light gray with a green booger somewhere on it. 
[00:50:30]  I have no clue where it is.  Oh, that is gross, man.  Yeah, people that stay over your house and do things like that, having sex on your couch, that's pretty rude.  Well, there was two, like, nasty spots.  I thought it was the old splooge stains.  Yeah.  But I scrubbed and scrubbed and scrubbed, and they're still there, so now I'm thinking it might be just a little grease from Chinese food or something, thank God.  You think?  Well, what else could it be?  It could be splooge.  Nah, I think you can wash that out pretty much.  No, no, that don't come out.  There's that little border area of the stain that won't come out, where it's kind of wicked to the side, and all the proteins and everything kind of collected on the edge of it. 
[00:51:00]  Chris the Trucker wants in on this.  Chris, go ahead, buddy.  Yeah, Anthony.  Yes, sir.  Can you hear me?  Of course I can.  Hey, Anthony.  Yeah.  Chris.  You can't hear me?  Oh.  Oh, come on.  Buttons?  Chris.  Buttons?  Yeah, Anthony.  Yeah.  Yeah, hey, that's the only one you know about. 
[00:51:30]  What about the rest of the house?  Oh, the kid?  Yeah, maybe for two days they were there.  Yeah, three kids there?  Maybe they were wiping boogers everywhere?  Yeah, hey, I got four kids, and I tell you, they do a little bit of sick of everything.  Yep, time to find a new house, Anthony.  Oh, my God.  Time to get a maid service in there and clean up the whole thing.  There you go.  You should have seen.  That's true, actually.  This probably boogers all over your house.  Oh, my God.  You should have seen my girlfriend going nuts.  She went around the house with disinfectant stuff and cleaning stuff, and I was like, 
[00:52:00]  what are you doing?  She goes, kids with meat hands just touching everything, like freaking out.  She's a vegetarian, but not crazy vegetarian where if she sees me eating a burger or something,  she's going to freak out.  But the fact that the kids, you know how kids are when they eat like hamburgers?  Yeah, yeah.  It just gets all over their hands, and then they're walking around like touching stuff.  And she doesn't want to be grabbing a faucet, you know, and just have this greasy burger 
[00:52:30]  juice on the faucet.  So she's running around like a mad woman.  Tina, clean this up.  You guys are like that couple from National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation.  Margo and that other dude.  Really?  Yeah, the neighbors.  I don't remember that.  It's all about just you two.  You don't want any kids around.  We are.  You don't want anyone touching your stuff.  We are the most selfish people.  What's the other guy's name in that? 
[00:53:00]  Because I know the famous line is, I don't know Margo.  Yeah.  Oh, Todd.  Todd?  You're Todd and Margo.  Todd and Margo.  From National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation.  I consider myself like a generous person when it comes to like what I have, things like that.  Then I'm fine.  But we are two of the most selfish, self-centered people when it just comes to our own convenience  and things.  Like, we enjoy just leave us alone. 
[00:53:30]  Any little shaking up of my daily routines just gets me crazy.  You guys are better known as loners.  Yeah, yeah, that's pretty much it.  We have our life and that's what we want to do in the Dutch.  She doesn't want grease on the phone.  Well, already there should come out of this way. 
[00:54:00]  Let's go, take the booth.  I don't know.  Oh, absolutely.  There streets salvation there.  Well, I'm trying to play like Battlefield 1942.  Take the który.  Get the clue.  Woo-hoo.  Hey, buddy.  Put the unskilled right down there.  Here we are friends.  Do usi. par  у tel With his wife traditionally bumps.  Super father, would you take his mommy or Aristotle Barone?

We're not like company people.  I know,  we have two full rooms. 
[00:55:00]  No, no.  The living room is still,  you don't even set them up for me.  We're not set for company people.  I know.  But,  the dining room, the formal like dining room,  nothing in there.  And that's why they had room to...  Yeah.  But I need to see that there.  No, we're not meant for company.  We're not built for company.  No, no.  Yeah. 
[00:55:30]  No, a little bit.  Let's say hi to Tom in Philly.  Tom, what's up?  Hey boys, how are you doing this morning?  Oh, pretty good.  Oh, okay.  Okay.  Okay.  We can't be kicking children in the liver.  Yeah, why would I do that, sir?  Why would I do that?  Why would I do that?  Alright.  What are you doing down here?  Mike in Kansas, what's up? 
[00:56:00]  No, tell me,  what's going on, Mike?  What's going on with the volume on the phones today?  Why? What's going on with the volume on the phones today?  Do you like it?  It's a suggestion for that second.  What's up with this?  What's up with this?  The lesbian booger couch?  Yeah.  Dude, it's one booger.  Yeah, but that's quite enough.  One booger is all it takes.  So, what did the guy say?  Because finally the search had to be called off.  He did.  The search had to be called off. 
[00:56:30]  The booger was called off.  It's now a recovery.  The search and rescue was called off,  and now it's just a recovery.  Well, he just said,  well, apologize to Anthony.  And you know, the kid says,  I'm sorry, but, you know,  the booger's still there.  Didn't the kid know where he put the booger there?  You know, kids, he dug deep,  and then he shoved his hand, like,  between the crack and the couch,  and then wiped the booger down there.  So I guess when he looked for it, 
[00:57:00]  it had already probably, like, come off.  Ugh, I'm getting grossed out.  And now it's, like, under the cushion.  I'm sure if I look around,  but I don't want to look around  because I don't want to find it.  That's something I don't want to find.  Opie and Anthony's best bits.

[01:00:00]  So we went with a different bit that Danny selected.  What bit is it?  Oh, I'll look at it.  Now, wait a minute.  That just was very telling.  I know what that is.  Nathaniel is not confident in this at all.  I have the most confidence.  No, you said which Danny chose.  But there's some, you know, discussion as to who contributed to what and people not getting credit.  And I think Danny selected an excellent pick.  You would absolutely not give Danny credit.  No.  You wouldn't say you did it if he didn't do it. 
[01:00:30]  But you wouldn't step up and actually give him credit.  And it's ridiculous.  here's the original right dialogue hey guys how you doing long time list they're glad to have you

[01:14:30]  ever do yeah just end everything he says with opie and anthony perversion for profit  wow this guy's dead serious oh this guy could not be more serious he's standing in this very 50s office  setting with a map of the united states behind him with pins in it for some reason you know i guess where  all the pornography is and he's just angry at all this sorry they're showing the forecast and for friday 
[01:15:00]  it says it says very nippy nippy why do the weather forecasters have to use such pornographic words like  nippy or penis-y out why what does it mean here in colorado when it's going to be snatch-like  they have that for friday they constantly portray abnormal sexual behavior as being 
[01:15:30]  normal normal they glorify unnatural sexual acts they tell young students that smart it's thrilling it  provides kicks to be a homosexual i saved it and every other kind of devious it provides kicks to be a  homosexual i don't know if that's quite a kick yeah quick ow i'm not getting kicks oh you're kicking the

[01:16:30]  with pornography because it was the beautiful wonderful 50s everything tied into communism  even gays even gays pornography everything tied into uh to the communists the military caplains  association of the united states sounds like practically every major fraternal civic and  religious organizations the juvenile court judges the federal bureau of investigation innumerable 
[01:17:00]  psychiatrists sociologists and psychologists attribute the moral decay among our people  in very large part to the obscene and pornographic literature so prevalent in our society  this moral decay weakens our resistance to the onslaught of the communist masters of deceit  wow see we're looking at porno yeah and you turn your back on the commies who just march in while 
[01:17:30]  you're spanking it to some big-titted girly magazine what is sure what an idiot he doesn't think the  communists are spanking it too while you have your hands wrapped around your johnson the commies are  marching in hands wrapped around a rifle to steal your sweetheart  well they actually thought that grandma was a communist when she got a period because her dress  was red better dead than red granny 
[01:18:00]  she's wearing communist panties in the outhouse  hey i thought you wanted an apple yeah i do want an apple where's ricky  you're throwing batches the communists are throwing hand grenades they'll be celebrating  their holidays on the white house lawn while you're cleaning up with a tissue  ricky

[01:19:00]  and while he was testified that he had been stimulated to this he and his crime  by reading a nudist magazine a federal court judge in washington was granting to that very same publication  a second-class mailing permit  well  raped and killed a five-year-old girl all they found was her little cowboy 
[01:19:30]  and little fake six-shooters and very little boots  all right here's the clip you've been talking about the evil  homosexual homosexual homosexual homosexuals  think then of the consequences to the inexperienced youth  who in purchasing and studying this material becomes a pawn for these misfits 
[01:20:00]  these homosexuals who have a slogan that betrays the evil of the breeze slogan  today's conquest they say is tomorrow's  competition  i thought it was going to be the governor age at which homosexuals prefer their conquest  look here at the young face and bright smile which could be the hope of the world  noah  but in the other half of the picture is revealed the seduction of the innocent 
[01:20:30]  look at this poor young lad but when looking think of the others who might follow his perfidious  footsteps when photos like these are available at the corner news rack  what is the homosexual slogan taste like shit i'll have to  oh  oh yeah sure homosexual homosexuals the homosexual preying on this lovely young lad 
[01:21:00]  calling him a young lad look at him in his sailor suit  yeah crying as he spins in a circle in a brown paper bag  in a stall in port authorities look at this lovely young lad who came to work  he's wearing a corduroy blazer and his shirt buttoned down to his chest  and look at the homosexuals enjoying it 
[01:21:30]  some of them pay twenty dollars to have him wear a pink tube top  ah that awful  freddy and philly wondering if that guy was looking at eatabullet.com he's looking at that  lovely young lad very nice  ah very good  hi you're listening to opie and anthony's best bits this one's where steve's car which is a hybrid 
[01:22:00]  broke down and opie anthony and jim all took turns making fun of him for it  his car sounds like it's from the jetsons eat  shit  that was terrible steve's gay all right we have another uh song parody that came in overnight  in honor of steve and his hybrid car  oh well steve should come in and talk about something because  yeah let's get uh martini steve in studio here  little problem i think  here comes steve what we had where is he 
[01:22:30]  what's the problem well you know hybrids are very efficient but  the one way they do perform just like regular cars is when you leave the dome light on all night  it does kill the regular battery the dome light on for what three seconds 
[01:23:00]  wait i uh that's all it took what leaving to shut down your hybrid leaving the interior lights on  all night yeah killed the uh killed killed it didn't shut off the hybrid engine so once i got  it jumped it worked just fine but the uh the regular electronics like all like the windows and  stuff like that operate off the same uh battery that a regular car would operate off of and your  starter yeah everything so like when so leaving all the lights on would kill the battery just like  it would in any other car but but why why would it kill did did it kill the electric motor that  drives your car not so theoretically you could have backed out under electric power once i got 
[01:23:30]  it jumped the thing worked fine i'm not talking about to get it jumped i mean could you have backed  it out under your electric motor power well no because i couldn't start it but isn't it just a  switch because it's the electric switch that powers the switch that turns on the car  yeah oh the actual switch that turns on that 300 volt electric motor yeah is power is is powered by 
[01:24:00]  a normal regular diehard battery so even though there's enough power to run the electric motor yeah  you can't start it right to run it on the electric that i learned last night yeah or yesterday morning  yeah exactly because you should be able to uh run it on just the electric motor that's exactly what i  thought and once once you actually get the thing once you actually power up the starter and get it  going yeah everything's fine you know and it starts pumping pumping the power back into the uh the  regular auxiliary battery should there be a backup that perhaps the batteries that power your your 
[01:24:30]  electric motor that were fine that you say can then be used to maybe jump start your car i think  i think there actually is but i wasn't i'm not you know well versed enough is there try it again  bad the old faggot mobile is not starting not a faggot mobile i am paying a lot less for gasoline  jump on a cock and ride that to work did you jerk off in the gas tank but that said there's a good  segue into chemistry's song about uh steve's hybrid car oh lovely song good old chemistry yeah i'm sure 
[01:25:00]  you're pissed off by this one no he's he's good so i can't really get pissed off at him but you know it  doesn't really he's pretty much calling you a faggot yes he is in this song we're pretty much  laughing and agreeing yeah here's chemistry's uh hybrid song for steve  i know a big bear he talks with good diction hibernates in toyota with good fuel emissions 
[01:25:30]  and great tax deductions his habitats a hybrid his paws are on the steering wheel he barely fits inside  it his cave has xm and a keyless entry don't leave the scent in your tent his belly is empty the only  bear i know a gastric bypass smarter than the average roll up in the hybrid and steal your picnic basket  the ranger's lunch always makes his belly grown the last i seen him he was speeding around jellystone  getting 40 miles per gallon rolling through the rockies doing vermone promos for two dish jockeys  steams a piece of garbage forged for nuts and berries top of the food chain but drives a car for ferries piece 
[01:26:00]  of shit stores energy with friction and magnets ramones hybrids are for faggots hybrids are gay steve's  the queer plug in your automobile you take it in the rear you homo yo his car got a kickstand going  buy a new one spend more than six grand hybrids are gay steve's a queer if you plug in your automobile you  take it in the rear you take it in the rear you homo his car got a kickstand going  buy a new one spend more than six grand 
[01:26:30]  hybrid softy hybrid softy  hybrid softy  come on steve come on yeah  all right well he's a crap i'm gonna go work on my new song chemistry got killed with a claw hammer  so how'd you get into work uh they gave me a rental until they can uh  oh yeah i mean it's not i i have it's it's under full warranty and they go yeah okay we're just 
[01:27:00]  going to replace the battery so they gave you a rental it was it a hybrid rental no it's not  because they can't they can't keep those in the showroom long enough to uh oh they're flying off the  shelves they certainly are you know what call me a homo if you want but you know all right  but there's a year-long waiting list for these cars so you know you also have a waiting list for  azt when they only make a well when they only make a hundred a year 
[01:27:30]  exactly that's why there's a waiting list you idiot how many are on the assembly line plenty of  them oh stop it did you wait when we were in los angeles did you see all the hybrid cars that  were no no i was too busy whizzing past them in some scooped up rocket car that i rented  what happened to your car did the power surge protector fail  plug-in vehicle makes me sick it's not a plug-in vehicle it certainly is hybrid hybrid taxis are  coming to new york exactly big story in the paper today apparently there's a surplus of faggot cab 
[01:28:00]  drivers yeah uh yeah the these uh taxi cab drivers have the option to convert from gas-guzzling  ford crown victorias to any of six car models that run on both gas and electricity right  so uh hybrid uh cabs coming to new york it looks like great steve was uh driving to work and almost  got rear-ended because he pushed in the cigarette lighter by accident and uh his speed went down  like 20 miles per hour doesn't do that no it doesn't i kind of like that it went in yeah 
[01:28:30]  i like that i kind of like this it's good format but my presentation really  because you knew that one was finished yeah because when you said he pushed his cigarette  lighter in and then just you kept on trucking and then it tends to slow the car down 20 miles  i had to pick a speed yeah it really stunk my presentation blew it was just a little mixed  up good idea because i could picture steve driving and then the cigarette lighter and then he slows  down because of the battery you know just the idea being steve being rear-ended is funny in itself 
[01:29:00]  that's true all right so mean no i love you steve but just why don't you take off there steve  all right oh my god come on come on there you go no no no i pushed that piece of  shit out of here oh p and anthony's best bits best drew boogie remix  oh  that's the real deal yeah that's what you do that's the real deal that's the shit that's the real deal

[01:33:00]  and this is a real good one, too.  Just like the last one.  This is when Regis sings.  We listen to some of Regis' singing,  we make fun of it,  and Krista the Blind Girl calls in,  and it gets out of hand.  Well, yeah, before you know it,  one of the most classic lines  comes out of Jimmy's mouth.  Made a promo.  Yeah.  ONA's Best Bits.  Wake up, wake up, wake up,  Yeah, I'm so tired of waiting, 
[01:33:30]  I'm waiting for us now.  Wake up, wake up, wake up,  Yeah, I'm so sick of waiting  for us to make a move.  Wake up, wake up, wake up,  and we will never lose.  Wake up, wake up, wake up,  it's time to make a move.  Wake up, wake up, wake up,  and we will never lose.  Wake up, wake up, wake up,  Yeah, the O.P. and Anthony Show, the O.N.A. virus spreading across America. 
[01:34:00]  Thanks for checking us out, and thanks for helping us out with the whole virus thing.  What's wrong, Jim Norton?  I'm just, as we're coming back from break, watching this, what is this show at Regis?  Good Morning America?  Regis and Kelly.  I don't even know what it's called.  No, because you're never up this early.  Until recently, but.  I just don't, it's amazing to me the forced cuteness that people buy into.  Dude, she's hot.  I'm not saying, dude, please.  She's a dirty girl, too, by the way.  She takes the drill, though? 
[01:34:30]  She's a very dirty girl, yes.  How do you know?  You could just tell, and she was on our show before she got really famous, and you could  just tell by talking to her that she's a dirty girl.  She's had how many kids, though?  You don't know what kind of wreckage is down there.  Nah, man.  Some of the girls could keep it together after they have the kids.  You know something?  That really is a turn-off.  What am I going to say?  I know Ope's into that.  You like the pregnant chicks.  Do you really?  He had a pregnant chick come into the studio once.  He might get naked and do a retarded dance in front of him. 
[01:35:00]  Big areolas with milk leaking out of them?  Yeah.  It's called a lap dance.  Yeah, it's one of my weird fetishes.  I have a few weird ones, too, but not prey.  I like just me and her to be involved.  I don't need a little rug rat in there in the belly.  In there, grabbing at your junk as it thrusts into his head.  Into the soft spot.  Fire some into the soft spot.  You pull it out.  Your mule smells like saline because there's placenta on it.  That's great.  I'm going to give the little fetus the Kennedy treatment and blast him in the head. 
[01:35:30]  Jesus.  That's it.  Look at his fat little fetus head back and to the left.  The music interlude of the O&A show.  Oh, really?  What is this?  You make me feel so young.  Ah, the Regis CD.  You make me feel so spring has sprung.  And every time I see you grin.  You make me feel so young, Gilman.  I'm a happy individual the moment that you speak. 
[01:36:00]  Oh.  I want to go play hide and seek.  In your pussy.  I want to go and bounce the moon.  Wow.  Just like a toy balloon.  Oh.  You and I are just like a couple of tots.  Tots.  Running across the meadow.  Picking up lots of forget-me-nots. 
[01:36:30]  Oh.  You make me feel so young.  You make me feel so young.  You make me feel there are songs to be sung.  Like when I was hard.  There's a song to be rung.  A wonderful thing to be flowed.  And even when I'm old and gray.  Like now?  That is some awful music, man.  It's wonderful when a celebrity puts out a music CD.  I love these things.  You know what that's called?  That's called when you get to a point in the business 
[01:37:00]  where nobody around you is comfortable enough to go,  Dude, that stinks.  That's awfulness.  People, you think anybody he knows likes that?  Do you think anyone's gone?  Boy, that was terrific.  Not someone he knows, but I know someone that likes it  and probably plays it on his show.  Who?  Don't you think that's being played on Frank's Place?  Oh, probably.  I bet.  Here's the latest one from Regis.  It's the song that's gotta be up.  Picking up forget-me-nots. 
[01:37:30]  Forget-me-nots.  Like a toy balloon.  Just stay away from the coon.  Running around like a couple of tots.  Like tots.  I kinda...  I wanna F your ass till it rots.  Come here, Gelman.  I'm, uh...  Then put my dick in your nose and make you lick off the snot.  You make me feel so young.  I kinda like...  I wanna stick it in your bong. 
[01:38:00]  Rub my helmet on your tongue.  And then chop-lock you in the throat.  Hey, hey, that's in rhyme.  That was the end of the verse.  I know, I'm just...  Pick forget-me-nots.  While you suck cum shots out of my hose.  I thought we couldn't improvise here.  You make me feel so young. 
[01:38:30]  Put some of that crap on my tongue.  Regis, why is there an open sore on my vag lip?  That's a forget-me-nots.  On your twats.  So beat it, you grungy whore.  Mop, mop.  Wish I could do his voice.  Sugar.  Oh, sugar.  That's good.  I saw a commercial for that on late night television for his CD. 
[01:39:00]  And I thought it was a joke.  I thought it was like I was watching mad TV or something.  It was...  It was...  It didn't look real.  It was like, Regis sings all of your favorite hits from the past.  I was like, what?  Really?  At least when William Shatner does it, he knows he stinks.  You make me feel so young.  Young, right.  Spock.  Even when I had the aging disease from the...  Plamidin.  You want to try this one really fast?  You make me...  Yeah, let's hear another from Regis.  Regis Philp.

[01:40:00]  It must mean a crippled guy just fell out of his chair.  For the sun  Comes shining through  That's right, Gilman.  But when you're crying  You just got your hip test back.  When you're crying on the rain  So stop your sighing  Be happy  Again  Keep on smiling  Because when you're smiling

[02:43:30]  A lot of you newer listeners out there may have heard reference to a java log  But have no idea why or what it is  Well, you guys are in luck  Because here it is  The infamous bit about Opie and his fireplace  ONA's best bits  Pew, pew  ONA's best bits  Is that good enough?  That's great  You know, Jay came over 
[02:44:00]  A really good friend of ours and stuff  And we decide, you know, to just, you know, mellow out and watch the Survivor finale last year  Dude, this is one of the gayest stories I'll ever tell in the air, okay?  It's already gearing up to be gay  You're in second gay gear  It's beyond gay, I'm going to admit it  I'm not gay  Of course  But it's going to be hard to defend this story, okay?  I hope this doesn't go by the way where I sense it might be going  What?  I just don't like this  I'm having a feeling, too 
[02:44:30]  Oh, it's awful  It's awful  I'm definitely throwing myself in the barrel here  I meant to tell this story a long time ago  So, you know, Jay was visiting or whatever  And it was the Survivor finale  And it was a cold, rainy night  Ooh  And we decide, you know, to get some takeout  Some cheese and crackers  Wait a minute  Crack open a bottle of wine  I'm telling you  I'm telling you, it's gay crap  You can stop right there  All right  And it's already 
[02:45:00]  All right, I guess I will  Really gay  Do you want to hear more or not?  Of course  All right  We go through the supermarket to get all this stuff  We're planning just a mellow night, you know?  In front of the TV to watch the Survivor finale, okay?  Dude, men, some wine, an afghan  Dude, trust me  Cheese, crackers, no dried sausage  Or did you bring that yourselves?  It's awful  Shut up  So, we're going up and down the aisles  And I'm like, hey, Jay, I got a fireplace that I've never used, right?  So, they got the door flames? 
[02:45:30]  Yeah, very easy  Not only do they have the door flame logs  By the way, after I tell the story, I will not be reading my email for two to three days, okay?  All right  So, good luck trying to abuse me  And I'm not reading any message boards  And I'm not even going to answer the phones  Oh, okay  So, we see the pile of door flame logs  But right next to it are java logs  What is a java log?  Java logs are like door flame logs  But they give the smell of coffee in your apartment when you're burning them 
[02:46:00]  Are you kidding?  And I love my coffee, so I'm like, hey, let's try the java log  Why not get a door flame and make some coffee?  Why is my coffee spilled everywhere?  Is yours not a java log?  She spilled my java log  What the hell is this?  This is not what I ordered?  You bitch  This is not even close to what I ordered  Uh-oh  Caffey Diva  Look at this thing  Look at that  Wow, it's filled up to the tippity top  Look at it 
[02:46:30]  It's spilling all over the console  Like, I don't know if it's possible  But I think there's just too much liquid in here  And it's now trying to escape  Did one of the savage deli people that work in this fine city  One of those savage Middle Easterns  No, it's a Starbucks  Dude, it doesn't look like Starbucks  What is this?  I ordered a cappuccino  Oh, you did?  A 2% cappuccino  Sorry, I heard the grande skim thing  What, did they put both in the cup?  No, I  The thing is overflowing 
[02:47:00]  Overflowing  I over-latte-ed it  I guess  Ah  We'll go, uh, fix that  I don't know what this is  But thank you for the effort  I really appreciate it  No problem  Maybe he's got other things on his mind  This is the new friendlier Opie  Having sex with porn stars or something  Alright, so  How's that going?  Uh  Still going?  Yeah, we've kind of moved on  I'm banging other girls  She's banging hundreds of other guys  Oh  It's in the past  Maybe next month I'll have an update for you  Alright, sorry to hear that 
[02:47:30]  No, it's alright  I mean for the show  Oh, yeah  Fair enough  Alright  I want the new friendlier Opie  If someone spills your coffee  I pardon you  I pardon you  Anyway, so  So I go, hey Jay  Let's try these Java logs  So we bring the Java logs home  With cheese and crackers  All excited  The coffee smell  And the Survivor finale is about to begin with  It was the season with  What was his name?  Rupert or whatever the hell his name was  And the guy with the beard  The gay guy 
[02:48:00]  The gay guy  That's like the first season, bro  Oh, okay  This is only like last year  I watched the first season  That was about it  Alright, so  So I start the fire  We open up the wine  We got some takeout  Some cheese and crackers  Survivor's about to start  Fire's starting to crackle  Smelling the  Smelling the nice smell of Java  Dude, this is awful  I'm telling you  I know it's awful  But you know Jay  So it's not  It's not  Well, whatever  I'm not even going to try to explain  Because it does sound awful  It sounds awful  I understand 
[02:48:30]  Alright, so  It sounds awful  Sonny robbing the bank  To get Leon a sex change  Wasn't as gay as this  I know  So then, you know  It's an icy, rainy night out  You know  I'm like  Jay  I'm going to put some sweats on  And get comfortable  You know  Oh, jeez  Oh, I know  It just keeps going  So I don't have sweats  I have some flannel PJs on  I'm like  Well, no one's going to  This is the key to the story  I'm like  Ah, no one's going to see me  It's just Jay  I've known him forever  Yeah  Ant's known him forever  Look how I'm like 
[02:49:00]  Sure  I'm just praying  That you're going to help me out  A little bit here  I've always been completely  Dressed around Jay  Well, so have I  But I just happen to have  Flannel PJs on  Right  And the wine's flowing  And Survivor's on  And cheese and crackers  Cheese and crackers  And the javalog  Crackle and javalog  And all of a sudden  And all of a sudden  Jay's like  Hey  Is it getting smoky in here  Or is it my imagination?  I'm like  What?  So I look in the distance  And you can kind of see the smoke  A little haze  A little haze up high 
[02:49:30]  Right?  Uh-oh  So I'm like  Oh my God  Was the flume open?  Closed?  What the F?  Right?  So I  You know  I opened it or closed it  I don't know what I did  To hopefully get this smoke out  Because obviously  Something's not working right  Uh-huh  So whatever I did  Made it so much worse  So now the smoke  Is just pouring out  Of the fireplace  Into my apartment  Now it's getting pretty bad  It's getting serious  Uh-oh  So then I decide  Oh  Fuck  So I decided  To try to take the door  Flame log  And throw it out  In my backyard 
[02:50:00]  And as I'm trying  To get it out  Of the fireplace  The whole thing explodes  Making more fire  And smoke  What do you mean?  Like did a crackle thing?  Yeah it's all chemical  So it kind of just fell apart  And now it's just like  Now it's flaming  Alright?  Yeah so is the situation  Around your apartment  Dude  Wait for the punchline  So I'm like  Jay holy crap  Now we got a problem  Now the smoke  Is just flying out  Of the fireplace  Dark and thick  And going right up  To the ceiling  I mean it is bad  No exaggeration  So now I open  All the windows 
[02:50:30]  Open my back door  To my outdoor part there  I'm just hearing jokes  And jokes with every word  Oh I know  I opened my back door  It just gets  Big black and thick  Right  You know you're saying  Things that just  Conjure an image  If it wasn't so early  In LA  We'd have to get  Jay on the phone  Maybe we'll get him  On the phone tomorrow  So I'm like  Jay there's a fan  Downstairs  Go get it  So he grabs the fan  The windows are open  It's freezing out  The door's open  Now we got the fan  Now we're just  Blowing all this  All this black 
[02:51:00]  Dark smoke  Out of the apartment  Right?  Right?  And I'm like  Oh my god  What are we gonna do?  Now we're just  Running around  Trying to figure this out  Because I can't get  The door flame out  Right?  So all of a sudden  I'm downstairs  I forgot  Trying to find another  Fan or something  And all of a sudden  Do-do-do-do-do  Banging on the door  Really hard  Jay's like  From upstairs  He goes  Should I get that?  I'm like  Yeah I guess  I don't know  Who's stopping by  But yeah grab it  So it opens up the door  The fire department 
[02:51:30]  There you go  Yeah  But they weren't  Real firemen  They were  Chippendales dancers  And they throw out  Their helmets  Dude  So the fire department  Comes barging in  In full gear  With the oxygen on  The mask  Everything  I mean everything  Wow  Isn't that amazing  That the people  Actually in the apartment  Weren't the ones  They called  It got that bad  No it was really bad  I'm not kidding  Obviously the neighbors  Rattled me out 
[02:52:00]  Turns out  I went out the front door  And there were like  Three or four fire trucks  On my block  Closed off the whole street  They thought there was just  A massive fire going on  Because of the smoke  Just two guys  Eating some cheese and crackers  So there's three or four  Fire department guys  In full gear  That looked like  They just walked off  One of those stupid calendars  They sell every year  You know  Just big tough burly guys  In their gear  Buff  Shut up  And there 
[02:52:30]  There I am  In my PJs  Anthony  Couple glasses of wine  On the  You know  Near the couch  It looks real bad  For you  It looks horrendous  Because remember  Going back in the story  I said  I said that  That  I didn't think  Anyone was going to  See me this way  Of course  So you do things  When you don't  You know what I mean  You're like  Yeah whatever  Who's really going to  See me  So there's three or four  Guys in there  And we're looking  Just really bad  And faggy  And right next to my  Fire places  There's a picture 
[02:53:00]  Of Kurt Cobain  In makeup  I'm sure that didn't  Help the situation  Right  So all of a sudden  They're staring  At the apartment  They see it's a  Door of flame log  Right  And Jay and I  At this point  Are trying to look  Tough like  It was a door of flame  Log but we got it  Under control sir  Or whatever  You know  And they're like  They're on their  Walkie talk  He's like  Ah god  It's just a 202  Or whatever  They say  202 is fire  In a fag's apartment  Yeah exactly  That's what Jay said  You know  It's gotta be  Yeah  Yeah you boys  Have fun now  Yeah cause they're  On their walk

[02:57:30]  Ramone  Ramone  Ramone  Ramone  This sweeper has eights  Number four  I just love  A drive in the country  Laughing with  Opie and Anthony  That plane is flying  Off the road  Don't you think Ramone  Ramone 
[02:58:00]  Call 911  Opie and Anthony's best bits  Best Opie moment  Hey look at me  I'm a dick  Hey it's E-Rock  And we're up to Opie's  Where's my milk segment  Opie's milk was late  Arriving to the studio  And the bag that it arrived in  Set Opie off  So it's Opie and Anthony's  Best bits  I understand I have problems 
[02:58:30]  Trust me  I know that  Do you hear yourself  Dude what did I say before break  What did I say  I understand  There's something that happens  From time to time with me  Matter of fact it was a promo  Yep  Because they forgot my potatoes  Yes it wasn't about the potatoes  My blood sugar level drops  And I start losing my mind  I understand  All up with  Dude I just played a seven minute mash up song  Not for the stupid audience 
[02:59:00]  I could care less about them  Half of them went to another channel for a while  I threw that on so we could take a quick commercial break  And I could get some food in my gullet  So I don't pass out  I am not talking about the situation  So I wrote a note during the  While we're discussing the stupid tsunami song  That I could give a flying crap about by the way  But I figured it would fill up 20 minutes of radio today  I wrote a note to Steve  Steve  You know S.O.S.  I need milk immediately  Meaning my blood sugar level is dropping as I speak 
[02:59:30]  Uh huh  So that was literally five minutes before we went to break  And then I'm noticing there is no milk around  So I'm like  I'm a professional DJ  Find what's called filler  So I'm like  Make it believe I care that the Doors Blondie song is cool enough to play on the show  No it was because it was the longest thing I could find  Which was like six minutes long  I'm like hey man this is great  Listen to this crap  Thinking that the milk would arrive any second  I would get the cereal in my effing stomach 
[03:00:00]  And then I would be fine for the rest of the show  I am not talking about the situation  I am talking about the situation at hand  I am talking about the fact that you sound like a madman  And I understand  I'm not saying I'm not  Eric comes in with your milk  His only crime is he was pulling it from a Dwayne Reed bag  Who the eff gets milk from Dwayne Reed?  You get condoms and maybe some shampoo from Dwayne Reed  You don't get milk from Dwayne Reed 
[03:00:30]  He unloads on him  Why are you going to Dwayne Reed for the milk?  Because I need it right away  There's a deli right downstairs  Is there not?  You sound crazy  Is there a deli right downstairs?  There is absolutely a deli  And I agree  They should have gotten the milk from the deli  They have a bunch of retards that should be strapping bombs on them  And walking around in Iraq  Than working for us  Who would go to Dwayne Reed for milk  Knowing how desperate I am right now?  How come when I walked in  I walk into the studio  And he goes 
[03:01:00]  Where's my milk?  I don't know  I know  He yells at me  Where's my milk?  Like I have a line on the milk getting  Like I don't understand  My meters are like dropping fast  So it's called I go into a panic  It's not that I'm a diva  Why?  I treat these guys very nice  Unless I get into one of these situations  Eric, why wasn't the milk gotten  From the deli that is right downstairs  From this very building?  Okay, one  I didn't send him  So I don't know where he went  Two, apparently I've been told 
[03:01:30]  They don't sell milk downstairs  They don't sell milk downstairs, Danny?  They don't have sealed milk downstairs at the deli  I don't care if it's sealed  They'll put it in like a coffee cup  But that's fine  Oh, see now  How is anyone to know  You wouldn't come up with that and go  What is it?  I don't know what that animal's doing  It's open  It's open  It's an open container, Tina  Hold on  No, that's where I'm different than Jimmy  I don't really care about that  Especially under this situation  I just need to get food in me  I don't care 
[03:02:00]  Well, I kind of understand  I'll suck milk out of a cow  I don't care  I just need milk  You know what we need?  Emergency Parmalat milk  You put it in a cabinet somewhere  And it lasts forever  It sits there  And then when you open it up  Then it's got to be refrigerated  But it's like in case of emergency  Break glass  And you have your milk right there  We have that  I said that when I came in  Stop it  We have whole milk Parmalat  That's all we have  And he looked at me and did nothing  Because I didn't know what that was  No one does  You got that regular milk  No, I really didn't know what that was  It's regular milk 
[03:02:30]  It's just been processed  In a way that it's good  Until you open it  It's like  Here's the other problem  There is milk in the refrigerator  But you don't know if it went sour or anything  That's Parmalat right there  I really don't know what that is  It's milk  It's real milk  There's nothing different about it  It's just the way it's processed  It can last  Sealed  It can last for a long time  Can I explain something to Dean in the Bronx?  I know I'm whining  That's what I'm trying to tell you  I understand  Anthony brought it up during commercials  Going, dude, you sound like a raging river  I had to look right at Opie and go 
[03:03:00]  You sound like a madman  You're trying to wake me up  Out of this weird coma state I get into  It has nothing to do with being like  You know  Patrice from Brazil is saying  Come on  Come on  I feel the whole blood sugar level thing  Dropping in my body drastically, okay?  We still have a radio show to do  And then I'm looking at the clock  And all the meters  You know, counting down  Thinking  I don't have enough time to eat  Before we get back on the air  And then  Then they walk in with the milk 
[03:03:30]  In a Dwayne Reed bag  I'm like  I know where Dwayne Reed is  It's not close to here  No  So who went and got it?  Ricky  Oh  Of course it was Ricky  He stinks  If Opie wants milk  He only takes it from CVS or Rite Aid  No Dwayne Reed  Never Dwayne Reed  Jesus  That is an odd place to get milk  Mike from Jersey  My goodness  Look, I'm calming down already  Mike  Where did you buy your cold medicine?  Dairy barn?  Long Island joke  Mikey  Opie, you sound like Doc from Back to the Future right now 
[03:04:00]  It's like you're asking for 10,000 gigawatts  That's a stretch  Yeah  Alright  There he is  Now we'll listen to Opie eat  Because he had to go to Dwayne Reed for the milk  I thought  Stupid me  By the time the mashup was done  I would have  Had the  You'd have been done  You'd have been on seconds already  And no one would have cared  And you know  The show would have just moved on  You'd have been on your seconds  You're listening to Opie and Anthony's

[03:13:00]  Of Pat O'Brien  Jacking  Just a picture of a glistening sweaty Pat O'Brien  With dick in hand  Getting down to business  And that picture's probably going to be making the round soon  In the tabloids  Yeah  Somewhere on the internet  Yeah  But you're saying now it gets a little worse  Well yes  According to the Daily News  The gossip column called  Gatecrasher  This guy Ben 
[03:13:30]  The guy who writes Gatecrasher  Ben does the gossip column  Yeah Ben Whitcomb  Access Hollywood battle on  We should probably leave poor old Pat O'Brien alone  But the stories keep coming  A source tells us  He used to refer to a gay African American senior producer  At Access Hollywood as  The fruit monkey  Oh Jesus  And he would say this

[03:24:30]  I love it  This is the time  When Jim was upset  That he got some bad coffee  I think this is when  Derek did his  One food run ever  I believe you're correct sir  Yeah  But then he graduated  To board up  And he's been doing great  Ever since  I gotta just say  He's probably one of the best  Board ups  Any radio show could have  But this is a classic bit  Of Jim being a fancy man  And it became an awesome sweeper  In which Steve says  Coffee like it has an A in it  Danny 
[03:25:00]  Coffee diva  What is this  If someone farts  Alright what's the problem  Oh boy  What's the problem  What's the problem  The emperor is not happy  With his coffee  Oh no  Are we gonna have to break  Into this bit  With a reading  What is this  What's the problem Jimmy  I don't know  Kill him  I don't know  But  Oh boy  Derek  Why is your face  Warm up  Warm up your vocal cords  You might be reading  Might have to warm up that 
[03:25:30]  Where do we get our coffee  Every day  He  Alright what's going on  No one knows what's going on  Look at that cup  What brand is on that cup  I don't know  Exactly  But if it said Starbucks  You'd know that immediately  Oh yeah  Ben don't explain  What's happening on the air  Because people hate your voice  Stop ruining things Ben  Ruining the show Ben  I don't like  This is why  Two reasons I don't like this coffee  It doesn't taste good  And I don't like supporting  The savages that run  Most of these delis  Yeah I know Starbucks is a big 
[03:26:00]  You know big world order  Type of thing  Yup  You betcha  But at least they're not  Funding terrorism  I will not support  The savages  How much money  From one cup of coffee  From like a dollar  Cup of coffee  Do you think goes to Al Qaeda  When you buy one of those delis  I'm not saying necessarily Al Qaeda  I would say probably 15 cents  Out of every buck  You might be right  Yeah  And even if it doesn't go to Al Qaeda  It just goes to a guy  Who will watch a video of the detergents  And go well I see their point  And I just don't want him  To have my 15 cents  You don't want to support that  My friend  Absolutely not 
[03:26:30]  You're insane  I'm not insane  I won't support it  Did you get that cup of coffee  From a raghead  No I got it downstairs  Exactly  The one that won't let me in  Sometimes I come in at 5 to 6  Or whatever  Oh we're closed  I'm like can I buy coffee  No  That's a normal like joint though  That's not one of those corner delis  Whatever it is  I don't like it  I like Starbucks  I like the big company  That mushes the mom and pop  Awful companies  Only because their coffee  Is always stale  So did you tell him  To go to Starbucks  And he didn't  You want to taste this 
[03:27:00]  You want to taste this  And see how enjoyable this is  Why don't you throw it  Against the wall  I'm not a diva  I'm not a diva  I just want Starbucks coffee  I want Starbucks coffee  I'm a diva  Why are you picking up  Your Rent Boys book  I don't know  We all  Look I like him  He's a good kid  He's got a great smile  But we all  We all know the rules  Oh god  The show's going to turn gay again  It's not going to turn gay  But when  I just pray  There's a couple out there  That wants to be  Try to become the sexiest  State in America  When you ask 
[03:27:30]  When you ask the intern for coffee  And they know where you like  Your coffee from  And they come back  Yeah why did you go downstairs  First of all  He didn't say anything about Starbucks  And I haven't been on a coffee run  In like 3 weeks  Oh really  3 or 4 weeks  Really  Well I haven't sleuded the flag  In a little while  But I still know to do it  When it's in front of me  Oh god  Is it valid  No  Either way  As your punishment  Because you're a fine young man  And you work very hard  But this was inexcusable  There will have to be  Another coffee run  For Starbucks  And you're going to have to read  Young man  It's a very short paragraph 
[03:28:00]  From there to there  And I want you to read with dignity  And I want you to read proudly  No laughing  Hold on  Anthony wants to explain  Because there's a lot of new listeners  This is Jim's punishment  This is the only bit  That Jim Norton  Has officially brought  To the O&A show  Ever  He contributes very nicely  On a daily basis  But as far as bringing bits  To the table  He usually doesn't  But he decided to bring  This one to the table  Brought in a lovely  Lovely book  Titled Rent Boys  Don't fold it back  You're bending the cover  I like that picture 
[03:28:30]  Rent Boys  On the cover  Is a nude man  Young man  Covering  Covering his  Sensitives with his hand  And another hand  Tweaking his nipple  On the cover  And it's filled with  With stories of  Gay sex  And as Jim hands out  These punishments  To people around here  When they do something wrong  And the punishment  Is to read  From the book  You have to read  Seriously  You can't laugh it off  Like you know  Make a joke about it 
[03:29:00]  Because then it just  Comes off like a joke  And what happens  If he laughs during it  Do you want him  To pull his pants down  And you can paddle him  No  But if he laughs  Believe me  I'll have him reading  So much  That his lips  Will be too tired to laugh  If he thinks  Kaufman did some reading  Of The Great Gatsby  He will certainly  Be doing some  Love Andy Kaufman  References  Very good  She gets a mood in here  It's like a  Mark Perino show  With an intern  Saying things like this  Great  You need a  PlayStation young fella  Dave from Jersey  He says  Look I never went  For coffee there  But I know 
[03:29:30]  Norton loves Starbucks  That's right  Dave from Jersey  Alright  And I like the fact  That Starbucks  Is always fresh  I'm not whoring for Starbucks  I just like the way  It tastes the same  Every time  I would rather be  Like a hip and cool guy  And a hip and cool  That's what you like  I'd rather support  A smaller  Hey I don't go  With the big ones man  But the coffee  Always stinks  In these places  I'm sorry  Stinks  It's different  Every different place  You go  Every place  You're safe at Starbucks  I like the flavor  There you go  Don't read ahead young man  Just be surprised  As it happens  Alright let her rip  Yeah enjoy  He withdraws 
[03:30:00]  Slowly gently  He stands up  I reach over  And peel the rubber away  Letting it drop to the floor  I hug him to me  And place a now  Semi-flaccid cock  In my mouth  It no longer smells scrub  I lick it  I roll over on my back  And hang my head  Over the edge of the bed  I begin stroking my cock  Intent now  On my own orgasm  He bends his hard prick  So that it slides easily  Into my mouth  And down my throat  As he begins 
[03:30:30]  To fuck my face  I close my eyes  And breathe in  The marvelous musky scent  Of his sweaty  Heavy ball sack  I begin to cum  He cannot stop me now  My pleasure is so intense  I begin to choke  On his fresh  On his flesh  Deep inside my throat  Smells like  Oh he tastes delicious  Victory  I will be generous  With my  With this boy  Very generous  Good job  Thanks 
[03:31:00]  Have some coffee  Medium with skim  It's going to smell  Like his musty  Heavy sack  Look that was  Harder for us  Than it was for you  That was difficult  I don't like to  Meet out  That was pretty bad  That was a bad one  You could tell  That was really  Really bad  Dude I don't like  You think I like  Handing these out  I think you do  It helps people  I really think you do  Young Eric  Had a misstep the other day  And did some reading  And might I say 
[03:31:30]  He has been in tip top shape  Ever since  Opinion Anthony's best  Bestest sleeper  You're listening to the worst  Of Opinion Anthony  Number five  What is this  Alright what's the problem  Oh boy  What's the problem  What's the problem  The emperor is not happy  With his coffee  Oh no  Are we going to have  To break into  Jim Norton  Norton  Coffee diva  Coffee diva  Look at that cup  What brand is on that cup  I don't know  It doesn't taste good  I don't like it 
[03:32:00]  Where do we get our coffee  Every day  I like Starbucks  I like Starbucks  And I don't like supporting  The savages  Savages  That run most of these delis  You're insane  Yup  You betcha  You might be right  Yeah  Watch this  You want to taste this  Wow that's really nice  Float against the wall  I'm on Starbucks  Coffee  You betcha  Jim Norton  Coffee diva  Coffee diva  I know Starbucks

Anthony Show  XM 202 
[03:34:30]  The O.B. Anthony Show  Uh, which one is this?  Frankie Blue Part 1?  Yeah, which one?  That's the intro  That's the breaking story  So that's when they played  Did they play the tape?  Yeah  Okay  I'm pretty sure  Alright  O.N.A.'s Best Bits  So you think this is funny?  The Frankie Blue thing?  I do  I love it  Anytime you can  It's very voyeuristic  Even though it's going out  To a bunch of people  On the radio  I think this is very voyeuristic  It's an uncomfortable situation  It's somebody put in a position 
[03:35:00]  They shouldn't have been in  Well, I guess  What happened  Our old radio station  WNEW  Yeah  There's a curse  With our old station  Ever since we left  Absolutely  Ever since we left  It's just been in the toilet  They can't figure out  What to do with the station  And it's just failing miserably  Ratings are always in the toilet  They have tried  How many different formats?  They've tried three or four  Since we left  Yep  And the one that did the best  Was the three months  That they played Christmas music  Last year 
[03:35:30]  Right  They started like  At a Halloween  And played it through  New Year  And it did better  Than any format  They put on there  Well, our old company  They hired this dope  John Sykes  Who was supposed to  Help the radio division  And the radio division  Has been a disaster  Ever since he took the helm  And now they're just  Kind of paying him  And he's like in a little office  And no one bothers him  Because he's under contract  They're going to fire him  Real soon  But he had no business  Trying to run the radio division  Of Viacom  Got to bump Joel Hollander  Up into that position 
[03:36:00]  He's the genius  Joel Hollander is an amazing  Radio guy  And he will right the ship  But this guy  John Sykes  Which is just a waste of space  An asshole  A two-faced fuck  You know  He told Anthony and I  When we did the  Sex with Sam thing  That crazy-haired dick  That we were going  That we were going to be okay  He said we were going to be okay  And then all of a sudden  He just blew us off  Never talked to us again  And then just hid behind lawyers  And you know  And his secretary and stuff  Never could get him  On the phone again  And we find out  How he didn't like the show 
[03:36:30]  Didn't like what we were doing  That's the type of executive  You want running your radio division  A guy that doesn't have balls  And will tell you to your face  What's going on  You know  Oh didn't he think  It was bad for kids  The show  Yeah  Yeah  So you know  He thought he knew  What he was doing  And we get fired  And the station  Has been a complete disaster  Ever since  And the radio division  Quite frankly  Has been a complete disaster  Ever since  They lost millions  Upon millions of dollars  And in the end  It was John Sykes' fault  Simple as that  Joel Hollander wasn't  Running the radio division  Back then  He just wasn't 
[03:37:00]  And anyway  It's unheard of  In radio history  To have a station  That has been floundering  For as long as any W  It just doesn't happen  When that happens  At a station  They fix it  They fix the problem  Right  Especially in New York  Right  It's the number one mark  In the country  Right  You can't have a radio property  Just sitting there  With a  One rating  And a history  Like any W has  Yeah  It's in last place  There are radio stations  That don't even  Have a signal  A strong signal  In Manhattan  That are beating  Our old station 
[03:37:30]  Easy listening music stations  From Long Island  Beat it out  Right  It's ridiculous  So getting back  To the Frankie Blue  Thing in our old radio station  That has just been  In the toilet  Ever since we left  Falling apart  Because they really  Thought they knew  What they were doing  By firing us  And moving on  Oh yeah  They figured they  Would compete  With other stations  That are doing  Very well around New York  Because boy  There's a win situation  Go head to head  Against stations  That are just  Entrenched in the market  Have great ratings  Doing what they're doing  Because people 
[03:38:00]  Will just change  Their habits  Like that  For the same thing  They could get  In the place  That they've been  For years and years  And years  Now RuPaul is what  Their morning person  Now  Was RuPaul  Person  That's good  Oh whatever  Morning guy  It's a guy  Morning parental  Disappointment  RuPaul the drag queen  Does mornings over there  When I sit there  And you have to listen  To some people go  RuPaul she is so pretty  It's got a cock  It's a guy  Boy you're a buzz kill 
[03:38:30]  So then  Big smooth back  So then the old company  Gets the bright idea  To hire this Frankie  Blue guy  Because he was  He was really good  At KTU I guess  What was KTU  Kind of like a  Dance mix station  Yeah kind of like  Commercial dance music  Like dance music  So they're like  Well we'll hire the guy  That made KTU great  Uh huh  And we'll  We'll put him on  Any W  And he'll have the  Same success over here  Right  Well so far  He hasn't done anything  Except get drunk  At Christmas gatherings 
[03:39:00]  And Earl was there too  Yeah our old pal  Earl was here  Earl  Was there I should say  And Earl did not  Give us his tape  I want to get on  I want to go on the record  And tell you  He did not  Have anything to do  With the tape  We're about to play  Right  He didn't  Okay  So Frankie Blue  Was at the  Christmas luncheon  A couple days ago  A Christmas luncheon  They did a Christmas luncheon  And I guess  Everyone got  Completely hammered  I would too  If I was working over there  As a matter of fact  I did 
[03:39:30]  Many times  Yeah  He got destroyed  Everyone else  And with the ratings  That just came out  I think he had a few  Extra shots  Because he's probably  Thinking oh my god  I'm a fraud  At this point  Oh boy  So then he goes back  To the station  And he gets into  Some kind of argument  With the DJ  That was supposed  To go on the air  Now if he was  A little tipsy  At the time  I'm thinking  It probably wasn't  One of those  Good legitimate arguments  Where you have a point  I've been in arguments  With drunk people  They don't usually  Make good points  During arguments  You ever notice that  What is that  Why you gotta wear 
[03:40:00]  That fucking shirt  There's a good  Good argument  Yeah this one  Will last about  18 hours straight  Yeah  So that's what he does  He goes over there  Gets in a little tiff  And it's the DJ  That's supposed  To go on the air  She pretty much  Runs out of the station  Crying or something  I don't know  I wasn't there  Oh boy  But something  Happened and she  Just ran out  So now  Someone has to do  The radio show  So who do they  Get to do the show  Well Frankie Blue  Is the boss over there  He decides  Oh fuck her 
[03:40:30]  I'll just do it  He's gonna take the mic  Oh he's not a DJ  He's not on air  He's the program guy  He's a legendary  Quote programmer  Here in New York  Was he ever on the air  You'll see how legendary  He is in a minute here  And then he goes  Oh fuck I don't need her  I'll just do her shift  And I'll do  Probably a better job  Now he's doing it  For WNEW  During this  He's talking about  KTU  Which is their  Arch rival in competition  He's just  He's just  He's using the  KTU call letters  He makes a mistake  And actually says 
[03:41:00]  You know  On  1027 WKTU  KTU  And it's NEW  Yeah that's the station  They're trying to beat  Yeah  Oops  Oh they must have been  Loving this at KTU  I bet they play this  And just laugh their balls  So Ben  Has been playing this  All morning in the office  Just laughing like  Like an idiot  Like Ben  I think it's hilarious  Yeah  Yeah  And Earl's there  You know  Earl jumps on the air  Earl was the  Earl was the producer  Board op  Yeah  He's the board op guy  The girl that does the show  Is supposed to do that 
[03:41:30]  And Earl hits the buttons  When she goes to commercials  And stuff like that  He operates the board  Yeah  So he had to board op  For Frankie  Who's all hammered  Right  And who's his boss  And who's his boss  So Earl  I guess you hear him  Chime in a couple of times  I guess just out of nervousness  And you know  He must have been  Sitting there going  Oh my god  This guy's hammered  He can't even talk  He's stammering  He's forgetting words  He hiccups in one word  And it makes the word  Two words  Yeah  And Earl's just like  You can tell  He's really nervous  And then 
[03:42:00]  You gotta understand too  This is one of those  Radio stations  Where you talk really  Quickly between the music  If you're talking  More than 30 seconds  You're not doing your job  He's talking for about  Four minutes here  Oh I know  We cut it down  But we'll play about  Two and a half minutes of this  But he's just babbling  About nothing  Saying the wrong call letters  This is the boss  Of the radio station  That was supposed to put  WNAW back on the map  Here you go  In New York radio  The boss  So here  You know  I gotta be honest  If they got Frankie Blue  Drunk every day 
[03:42:30]  To do a radio show  Oh yeah  The ratings would go  Through the roof  I'd listen every day  Absolutely  And I hate that type of music  But that's the type of thing  They should do  Just get drunks on the air  Drunk DJs  Drunk DJs  I love this sound  This is the fucking boss  I love this sound  He's fucking hammered  And don't think for a second  That this is some kind of  Relaxed laid back delivery  Yeah this is not radio  From the 70s  When all the DJs  Were encouraged to talk like this  This guy's hammered 
[03:43:00]  This is the type of station  Where you know  Your voice has to be way up there  Like WKTU  Yeah high energy  Don't forget RuPaul  At the Mardead  Yeah  High energy  Your next chance to win $2,000  Coming up with RuPaul  Tomorrow morning  Right here  RuPaul let's get back to the music  Right  The new mix  W-N-E-W  That's the delivery  You're supposed to have  Right  Andy completely messes up  You're supposed to hit the post  Which is stop talking  Right when the vocals kick in  Yeah  He goes right over  Oh I know  Stomps on it  And he's the boss  I love this sound

We got some Frankie Blue audio here.  Yeah.  Don't go ahead.  Don't.  Don't.  I got nowhere else to go.  I got nowhere else to go. 
[03:57:30]  I got nothing else.  Yeah.  I love when it's someone else, man.  Oh, it is a treat when it's not us.  All right.  Well, we have to take a break.  These guys are getting bored.  How about this?  Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.  I think we got a couple more things to get to before the eggnog drinking contest for the  MiFi.  That's right, baby.  How about we start the contest at 8 o'clock so these guys know? 
[03:58:00]  8 o'clock, we'll start the eggnog drinking contest.  8 o'clock, we're starting the contest.  So they got a half hour if they want to, you know, maybe get coffee or something.  They got a half hour to get there.  Let them know, Hawk.  That's right, baby.  All right.  That's okay, baby.  Frankie Blue here, baby.  We're going to have a winner and we're going to fuck them.  And we're going to...  I can play that all morning.  Oh, it's classic.  Ben, good call, by the way.  I wasn't sure if we should go with it.  I love it.  I wasn't sure if it was that good, but it is hilarious. 
[03:58:30]  This is the Opie and Anthony show here at Sirius Satellite Radio.  That's right, baby.  The Opie and Anthony show.  Hey, it's E-Rock and we're up to Norton's Monster Rain.  In this segment, Norton explains about a game he used to play as a kid where he'd hide under  a porch with another little boy, but Norton tells the story a hell of a lot better than  I am doing right now.  So it's Norton's Monster Rain on the best bits of Opie and Anthony.  You're a completely different entity from what you were as a younger man, aren't you? 
[03:59:00]  Yeah, I've been drinking when I was 18.  I'm sober for almost half my life.  It was the booze that was doing all that and the drugs?  How do you figure at 18 to stop drinking booze?  I don't get that because I was just starting to get into all the drugs and the alcohol at  that point going, wow, look at what this one could do.  I think I was a sex addict from the age of, which I still am, but I think from the years  of like second grade, I'm not exaggerating, I was sexually active.  Never with an adult though, you know, unlucky little fella.  No, man, you know what?  So that addiction was always there.  If you're going to bring the subject up, I've got to say something had to happen to 
[03:59:30]  you.  I had to.  It wouldn't surprise me.  You are a cute little boy.  Oh, I've seen photos.  I want to molest myself.  Dude.  Blonde hair, eager, go-eyed.  I blew up a young picture of you and I put it in a paper bag in the toilet stall.  Crinkle, crinkle.  Because I've seen you act a lot, as you know, we travel and I mean, some of the stuff you  talk about, I'm like, you have to have first person knowledge as far as some of this  stuff goes.  I don't know.  What was your first anyway whatsoever sexual experience? 
[04:00:00]  It might have been, it was either getting blown and blowing one of my little friends  when I was like in second grade or like I was...  Wait, wait.  Did I just hear right?  Oh, yeah.  When I was a little, sure.  I was in second grade with little boys, you jerk.  Yeah.  Wait, wait.  You and another little boy went down on each other.  Oh, absolutely.  It was called Monster...  Okay, that's it, Ovi.  It was called Monster Race.  Oh, yeah.  I was probably in second...  That stuff happened when I was in like second grade.  In second grade.  Hold on. 
[04:00:30]  You make it too easy because I've been keeping a notepad since we've been off the air, right?  Yeah.  And I was at the Montreal Comedy Festival, again, the quantum leaping all over the place.  And I went to Montreal and all our pals are up there doing their thing, Voss and whatever,  everybody.  And Norton was doing this showcase.  It was the Dirty Show or something like that?  No, it was called, it was Jeff Singer put on a show called Confessing It.  It was hilarious.  When you tell a true story and I call it a true story.  So I'm sitting in the audience listening to Norton admit to all these Canadians that  he used to play a game called Monster Rain when he was a kid. 
[04:01:00]  Monster Rain?  Monster Rain.  So I quickly got a Sharpie rotor right on my palm, making sure that the ink wouldn't  like fade out anytime soon.  What's Monster Rain?  What, you want to explain Monster Rain?  I thought you wouldn't confess to something.  Who cares?  I was in second grade.  I thought it would take us an hour to get this story out.  Oh, dude, please.  No, I don't give a shit.  I was in second grade and my friend and I, I don't even remember his name, would play  this game where it would be, we would pretend that it was raining Monster Rain and we would  go under a porch and blow each other.  I don't remember how it happened, why there was Monster Rain involved. 
[04:01:30]  That was like a code word.  I honestly don't remember where it came from.  Let's play Monster Rain.  Monster Rain.  And you run under the porch.  And yeah, and it would just, it's all very vague memories.  Wait, but that's a...  At that age, would it end in any way?  No, I don't even think I got a ride.  I didn't know.  Wait, that's second grade?  Yes.  I know all that because that was in Edison.  I moved to North Brunswick a Halloween of fourth grade, which was obviously the beginning  of the school year in fourth grade. 
[04:02:00]  So that stuff happened like long before that.  I still remember the first girl.  I don't remember the first girl I kissed, but I remember the first pornographic picture  I saw.  I remember the first girl, Janice, whose last name I do remember, but won't say  it, I remember kissing her little lips and putting my face on her ass.  That's where I got my ass fetish from.  And how old were you then?  Second or third grade.  She was like a year older than me.  She's getting action.  I remember trying to get this girl to sit on my lap naked next to some sticker bushes.  I'm like, you can either sit on my lap or you can sit on the sticker bushes.  And she picked the sticker bushes.  You wonder why I have no self-esteem. 
[04:02:30]  This was last night, right?  This was very recently, yeah.  She was in third grade.  I pulled up to my Saturn.  Help, mommy's sick.  Get in the car.  I don't like sticker bushes.  Wow.  So that was the first sexual experience in second grade?  No, no.  I don't remember if it was Janice's first.  I don't remember.  Would this be very mutual between everybody, or were you sort of a predator back then?  No.  I was younger.  We were the same age as.  But it wasn't any abuse.  There was no, like, adults involved.  No, I know. 
[04:03:00]  I completely understand.  Normal experimentation.  There are kids who do things like that.  In kindergarten, my first experience whatsoever was in kindergarten.  And it was a girl that lived down the street.  And we used to go into the shed behind her house.  And she would show me her hiney.  She would show me her hiney.  She was some, like, Dutch girl.  That's a lot more normal than Monster Rain, though.  Maybe so.  But I also...  I had no clue, by the way.  But this was kindergarten.  Where to take that? 
[04:03:30]  You show an ass.  You get a little tingling stuff, you know, looking at a girl's ass.  But where you go from there?  I didn't have a clue.  I wouldn't know to play Monster Rain.  I was such a late bloomer.  I had no idea what my stuff did until, like, I was 12.  I'm not even kidding.  Oh, no, no.  I got the, you know, the famous movies in grammar school.  We've talked about this on past shows.  Yeah.  All of a sudden, you go to grammar school thinking it's just going to be another regular day at school.  Another day of arts and crafts and, you know, milk and cookies.  Climbing the ropes in gym class and learning a little fake history, you know. 
[04:04:00]  Sure.  And the next thing you know, they're separating the boys from the girls.  And the gym, you go to the gym and they had the big door up.  The big separating door?  Yeah, the door that separated the gym.  And the next thing you know, you're in a room filled with guys.  And then the girls are on the other side.  And you're like, uh-oh.  And then they showed you the film.  John is noticing he's growing hair in areas we didn't have hair before.  He's interested in girls. 
[04:04:30]  Love those films.  They were hot.  So I saw that.  Hygiene is important at this time.  Yeah.  So is setting your alarm clock so you can get up even if a fire alarm goes off in your apartment room.  And so we saw the film.  And my life, obviously like everyone else's, my life changed.  Like, oh, screw this, you know, playing baseball after school every day.  But then it was obvious that the teachers told the parents that they're showing the film.  Oh, because you're supposed to work with them when they get home, right? 
[04:05:00]  When they get home.  So I think they even said something like, if you have any questions about the film you saw, we did tell your parents to expect some questions from you guys today.  From Junior when he comes home.  So this is a true story.  I went home and I climbed up into my apple tree and I wouldn't come down all afternoon.  And there's my dad at the bottom of the tree, you know, convincing me to come down so he could talk about this.  Why did you climb an apple tree in horror?  Jesus.  Because I just didn't want to hear my dad talking about sex. 
[04:05:30]  Oh.  Simple as that.  What a shock.  A shy boy named Opie climbing an apple tree.  Climbing a tree.  It was ridiculous.  And then his dad in the sheriff's suit standing below.  Now, come on down from that tree, Opie.  And then, you know, and then.  I don't know.  I'll get the ladder in.  Yeah.  And then I remember staying up there all day.  And, you know, he finally convinced me to come down.  He sits me in the living room.  Like, I remember this like it was yesterday.  Oh, boy.  This is a nightmare.  He's like, don't worry.  It'll be okay.  And all of a sudden he's like. 
[04:06:00]  When me and your mother.  No.  Yeah.  He's explaining what mom's poo-ha does.  No.  Stop it.  And what mom's boobies do.  And I'm just horrified.  Yeah.  That's traumatic.  And then I was asking.  That's to just learn it on the street.  And then I was asking.  You're serious.  I was asking what the back door does.  If that has anything to do with it.  You asked your father what the back door does.  You asked if your mother spoke Greek.  I don't know.  Your mother hasn't given that up yet.  Does mommy give Greek lessons? 
[04:06:30]  Well, because I think that was the day I sort of learned that there was more than one down there.  I didn't know.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I'm like.  Yeah.  Well, you wouldn't be familiar with the female anatomy.  So, there's a second one down there.  What does that do?  That's crazy.  Yeah.  You wouldn't be familiar with the female anatomy.  As a matter of fact, I think in first grade, I believed that in order to make babies, you had to do it in the girl's back door.  That's what I thought.  No.  You only do that if you want a doggy.  That old gag. 
[04:07:00]  Doggy style.  Ba-dum.  Ba-dum-bum.  Yeah.  It was horrifying, though, when they'd show you that film.  And then, yeah, you'd go home.  And I didn't.  My father wasn't living with us.  So, it was, you know.  Who would have to tell you?  Mom didn't even bother.  She didn't even bother trying to discuss this.  I learned it on the street.  I learned it, like, through second, third, fourth.  By fourth grade, I knew everything.  You learned it in a tree fort.  In a tree fort.  With a young man named Richard.  See, that was the difference.  He played Monster Rain. 
[04:07:30]  Monster Rain.  That is the best.  You gave that up way too easy.  I didn't care.  I'm talking about the story, but you also gave it up too easy when you were in second grade.  How I used to get that same girl, Julie, to sit on my face because she would wet her pants all the time.  I liked the way it smelled.  Oh, my God.  See, this is where it comes from.  That's true.  Do you think you were touched as a kid?  That's the point I'm making.  If not, I should have been.  You just don't know.  I almost hope so.  That would explain a lot.  God, I hope I didn't develop all this oddness on my own.  Would you ever do hypnosis or anything? 
[04:08:00]  I've tried hypnosis.  But they actually tried to hypnotize me recently on Tough Crab, but I really am very difficult to hypnotize because I can't relax.  Woke up from the hypnosis with his pants undone.  Hey, could you speak, Anthony, you ass?  Woke up from the hypnosis.  Sorry, I didn't get much sleep.  The alarm went off last night in my house.  You know, my sister's going to kill me, but I have to tell another story.  Uh-oh.  It involves your sister?  Yeah, this is a classic.  Fuck slow.  This is a classic.  Stop.  Dude, don't touch your stuff while I'm talking about my sister.  I'm not.  Yeah, I'm just like, I have an inch. 
[04:08:30]  Doesn't involve monster or rain, does it?  See, something else the listeners need to know.  Jim touches himself throughout the whole show.  Oh, yeah.  When he starts hearing something hot, he grabs himself and goes like, oh.  Is there any way we could build a counter-hire?  It's a new show, by the way.  Monster rain garage.  Is there any way we could build a counter-hire around Norton?  Let's just say that.  You know, do you remember back in the N.E.W. days, too?  Jim would actually take it out.  I mean, you...  Did you realize?  No, never.  No, never.  It was just guys in the room.  No, no.  Well, yeah, but you had it out.  No, no, no, no.  Monster rain.  No, Dice warned me about that.  Maybe. 
[04:09:00]  Dice warned me and said, there are times that Norton gets so turned on, he will take it out in  front of other guys and start whacking.  Is that true or not?  I don't know if he said that, but it's not true that I would do it.  I believe it.  I would tell you.  Shut up.  There was one time...  Listen to me.  You had it out.  There were times when chicks were in studio, and there was Montana Gunn and another chick,  and they would have drank out of the mule, but Steve was filming.  I'm like, no, I wouldn't take it out.  Not on camera.  Yeah.  You shy boy.  I know.  Yeah, but you know, when the show gets sexy at times...  Sexy.  Yeah, I'm a pervert.  I'm still waiting for that to happen. 
[04:09:30]  I know.  No, yes.  Well, we got the gay out today.  No, it might happen today, actually.  We got a couple escorts coming in.  A couple goers, yeah.  Yeah, a couple goers.  So, when the show goes down that sexy road, all of a sudden, Norton will try to get your  attention and pretty much go, look.  Oh, yeah.  I'll point at my lump.  Yeah, of course.  And he does it to everybody.  Like, look what I'm packing right now.  Why do you need to show all the guys that you're packing?  Because he gets absolutely disgusted.  He's like, oh!  You pulled your bag out in bars.  Just your bag.  One time I did that for a laugh, but I was rubbing it against a girl's leg. 
[04:10:00]  Yeah.  That was at the Long Island event.  I was talking to this chick.  Like, that was it to make you guys laugh, though.  I pulled my bag out, and I'm like, I'm standing next to her, and I'm pushing it on my helmet  against her leg while I'm talking.  She had jeans on.  I'm like, yeah.  And I'm like, pointing it.  Like, look, look, look, look.  And my helmet's against her jeans.  You ever pull your bag out and zip up your pants and try to convince the girl, not hard,  and try to convince the girl that you got gum stuck on your pants?  No, I didn't ever do that.  Why would I?  I was trying to go for a laugh and bob horribly.  I didn't mean to be so literal. 
[04:10:30]  I'm sorry.  Sometimes I do try to be funny.  No, but I thought you were doing like a thing that guys do.  Actually, some guys do.  Actually, some guys do do that.  Someone told me about that one.  Whatever.  Where were we?  Did you get a tingle in your stomach when it would be like, hey, you want to feel monster  rain coming?  See, I honestly don't remember.  I don't even think I got a rod, to be honest with you.  I don't remember.  I don't think I got a rod.  That is the weirdest story, man.  Yeah, it's very odd.  Monster rain. 
[04:11:00]  You got to make up a word for it because it would sound funny.  Hey, you want to give each other a head?  I don't think we knew the term.  I was too young to know the term.  I knew it was wrong or naughty.  How did you know it was something you did?  I tell you what.  How did you even know to put your mouth there?  Well, I don't know, to be honest with you.  Maybe he was...  My age, though, so it's like unless something happened in his life.  Maybe something happened to him.  How do you know that?  Why are you pointing at me when you're saying maybe he?  No, no, I meant he being the other guy involved in monster rain.  All right, we'll do that one to you.  How about you pointing at the window? 
[04:11:30]  That's where the guy is.  You're making Mike.  You're in the studio for how long was that?  That would have been monster murder.  A young boy choked to death today on the report.  That's right.  He was found with his teeth gone and curry in his lap.  Wow.  When I was a kid, I remember the first pornographic picture was two guys with mutton chops and  a girl in between them.  I'll never forget this.  And she's laying back.  One guy's having sex with her.  And one guy's got his mule in her mouth.  Like, her head is back hanging over.  So maybe that's how I knew. 
[04:12:00]  I don't remember.  But I still remember that like it was yesterday.  It must have just looked like Chewbacca down there, too, right?  I don't remember.  I just remember the guy's mutton chops and her mouth on his mule.  That is wild.  So that was the code to get some actual monster rain.  Yeah.  I don't remember.  Imagine Jim going to his mom.  Mom, I'm going outside to play monster rain.  Okay, Jimmy, have fun.  So monster rain, if the rain hit you, something bad would happen.  So you'd have to get out of the rain, right?  Is that the gimmick?  I think so.  So you had to take the potion.  That makes sense.  Yeah.  Drink out of this. 
[04:12:30]  It's an antidote for monster rain.  I need the antidote.  Don't want the monster to get you.  Swallow it all.  In hindsight, knowing what I know now, snakebite probably would have been a more appropriate  name for that game.  Snakebite.  Help!  I'm here.  The doctor's here.  Wow.  What a sick, twisted little boy.  That's classic.  So going back to the whole sex thing and finding things out as a kid, my sister hates when 
[04:13:00]  I tell her story, but it's the truth.  I'm from a big family, and we love TV like you, you know, Ant?  Sure.  Always watching the Brady Bunch and all that crap on TV, and we're all sitting there one  night, you know, watching something.  All of us are downstairs, mom and dad and my brothers and my other sister, right?  And all of a sudden, there's screaming coming from upstairs.  My sister's screaming.  You know this story?  They're screaming her head off.  I'm like, what the F is wrong with my sister, you know?  And all of a sudden, she goes, Mom!  I'm bleeding!  Oh, no. 
[04:13:30]  Had no idea what that was.  How old was she?  I don't know.  And had no clue?  No, I don't know.  Oh, geez.  You know, you've got to let the girls in on that little secret that that's going to happen.  Yeah, that might be something you might want to pass a note when they're a lot younger,  like, someday...  Someday, blood is going to flow from there.  It's going to look like you're being murdered.  Don't worry about it.  We'll talk about it when it happens.  And guys will ignore you for a week.  I thought they should tell every little girl that.  You're going to be a real bitch on wheels, and guys won't talk to you. 
[04:14:00]  You may feel guilty about your privates, but when will they start bleeding profusely?  And since it's the 70s, here's a belt with some snaps and pads and a strap on a ditee, a diaper.  Girls nowadays got it knocked.  I remember being a kid, and you ever discover one in the garbage pail in the bathroom?  I remember doing that.  I walked into the bathroom, and, you know, parents, because my mother didn't do this,  hide the big rolled-up wad of toilet paper. 
[04:14:30]  Because as a curious kid, if you look in the garbage...  Ben is disgusted.  You look in the garbage in the bathroom and see a big wadded-up toilet paper,  not crumpled up, but rolled,  you're going to think, oh, there's a present in there or something.  It's wrapped up so nicely.  No, I wouldn't think that.  What would you think?  Nothing.  I wouldn't look in the garbage for a wrapped-up present.  Okay, Monster Rain.  Yeah, Monster Rain.  Relax.  You would do that.  I'm not saying I wouldn't have looked in my friend's shorts for a gift,  but I certainly wouldn't have. 
[04:15:00]  Because it wasn't crumpled like you had blown your nose and thrown it in there.  It was wrapped up.  So I unraveled it.  And it was like, you know, you kind of pull on it and it unravels like a magician trick.  And you're like, ooh, ooh, what do we have here?  And I'm like, what do we got here?  There's something in here.  And then what came out was a used Kotex just, you know, covered.  And I was like, oh, my God, what's that? 
[04:15:30]  And I had to ask my mother.  I go, why is there something with blood on it in there?  And she just said, oh, shut up and sent me away.  Didn't even discuss with me.  Probably better if she didn't, yeah.  Thank God.  I learned that.  But you know something?  How many years later is it?  And I still remember that traumatic moment.  Hey, let's go to the phones.  This guy's claiming he played Monster Rain with you.  It's probably a joke.  Mudgee?  Fudgie.  Fudgie?  Fudgie, yeah.  Fudgie, Jesus.  Hi, Fudgie. 
[04:16:00]  You figured out what that other hole's for, huh?  Don't you remember what we used to do, Jim?  You used to take that big, fat pencil, and we used to put Elmer's glue on it and shove  it in our ass and try writing on the wall?  No.  That sounds like a fun thing.  No, and what you gave it away is, I would have used rubber cement.  Always easier on the buttocks.  All right, well, we got to try to do a bit.  I had another.  Oh, man, I just forgot to stop.  Oh, my God, I can't hang up the.  There you go.  All right, hold on.  It might be my fault.  He was ready to unload. 
[04:16:30]  My bad.  What did you forget, Jimmy?  What were you talking about?  I don't know.  I shouldn't have gone to the phones.  I just wrecked it.  Talking about the periods?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, the worst thing I ever found.  This was in the teenage years.  This has nothing to do with that.  I found a decapitated head.  No, that would have been funny.  In your trunk?  In your apartment?  A loaded, I lived with my parents, a loaded condom in the toilet.  Was it Pops?  Well, who else was it?  Well, you know.  Yeah, it was my parents.  I guess they didn't want, you know.  I mean, I was 17.  I've seen the...  They didn't want any more meaty disasters. 
[04:17:00]  Yeah, I guess they saw what a failure they were raising.  And they're like, quick, just put latex on it.  This all started because of his scars, by the way.  Yeah, Jim has like a road map on his arms.  He was a cutter because he played Monster Rain.  No, the Monster Rain was always fun.  This was later in the teenage years.  Jim, did you try to end it, though?  Yes and no.  It was more of an attention-seeking...  That's an attention-getter.  That is an attention-getter.  Yeah, I believe when you slice your wrist, it's just an attention-getter. 
[04:17:30]  Most times, yeah.  I'd say so.  There's so many other ways to do yourself in.  I think you're right.  I think you're right.  It was like, the one time I did it was really brutal.  And the people that died from that, they're like, hello?  You know, and they just run out of time.  But in general, they want to be found and then nurtured back to health.  Just want to be loved.  You know, if you're going to do it, there's so many other ways to go, man.  I knocked on my parents' door.  One of them I did was really bad.  Actually, when I needed like 18 stitches, New Year's Eve, 85, going into 86, I'm like,  uh-oh, this is a bad one. 
[04:18:00]  That was a good year.  Good way to start the year.  Yeah.  Positive note.  That was the year that I was in rehab when the Challenger blew.  But you have like, I don't know, four or five on one arm alone, I think.  And then he tried to go long ways down the vein once.  No, that's in the back.  That wasn't a suicide.  That was just anger.  Oh, okay.  That was not a suicide.  That's a brutal one on the left arm.  Yeah, that one and that one I did on the same day.  Oh, God.  But then he showed me the jugular one one day.  Are you sure you saw the jugular?  You showed me one.  I think it's a slight scar or something.  Maybe.  Unless I'm remembering some. 
[04:18:30]  I don't know.  Unless you remember me telling you.  But you actually had the razor up here and you just couldn't go through with it?  No.  It was obviously just a swipe.  Of course I couldn't go through with it.  But did you actually slice a little bit?  Yeah.  It was in the woods I did that.  I just took a box cutter and went, wow.  Oh, God.  But I don't think you can see that anymore.  I think you're remembering.  You might have seen something that might have been a, something that happened recently.  I remember you told me the story.  Okay, yeah, because I don't think I still have a scar.  And we weren't really laughing about that one.  No.  Opie and Anthony's Best Bits.  Best audio sent in by a listener.

The monster rain's coming, the sky's gray.  My pants down, two kids helping each other under the damn house.  Y'all know the game.  Monster fucking rain, it ain't a damn thing changed.  Y'all under the porch, your friend fellates you.  Crawl under as two digits masturbate you. 
[04:20:00]  I alleviate the stress with a cock caress.  I explode on my friend's neck with a monster mess.  Just two little toys, no need for vaginal lube.  Stuck on a little crotch with a slight lack of pubes.  We gotta keep it quiet, make sure mom don't find out.  I'll finish you off quick so I can put mine out.  It's just a little pleasure with a lot of shame.  Who cares, I gotta blame it all on the monster rain.  Get your cock out.  Jimmy says, get your cock out.  Put my cock in your mouth.  Pull, pull.  Put your face south while we're under the house. 
[04:20:30]  Jimmy, crawl under the porch.  Pull, pull.  Yeah, I said it, crawl under the porch.  The monster rain's coming, the sky's gray.

This is when Robert Kelly called in  and told a story about his interaction with Jerry Seinfeld.  And Seinfeld had two words to say to him that broke his little heart.  It's hilarious.  T-Rock. 
[04:25:30]  Hey, guys.  Let's say hi to Bob Kelly.  Bob.  Bob.  Bobby.  Bob.  Bob.  What's up?  What's up?  Hi, fella.  Can you hear us?  Hello?  Hello.  Bob, can you hear us?  Yeah, I can hear...  Are you guys fucking with me with that whole thing?  No, no, we're actually not.  We're not.  We're actually...  The phones are my problems all day.  Hi, what's up, man?  Colin was in the other day,  and he was telling us a story about you and Seinfeld. 
[04:26:00]  And it was a little embarrassing?  Ah, yeah.  That friggin' son of a bitch Seinfeld douchebag.  Would you like to tell us the story?  Yeah, I feel like I'm on The Tonight Show right now.  Hey, Johnny.  Norton's Ed.  I don't want to be Ed.  I want to be Doc.  Take one up the keister.  Is he gay?  I, uh...  He always seemed a little flamboyant. 
[04:26:30]  Seemed a little Noah-like.  Remember when he was filming Comedian?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, he was...  That son of a bitch was coming down with this little camera crew,  and I never talked to him.  I never said nothing to him.  I never said nothing to famous people when they come down there.  And there's certain comedians...  You're talking about the Comedy Cellar, by the way,  where most of that movie comedian was filmed.  Yes.  Thank you.  Where all the big-time New York comics hang out when they're not on the road.  Right.  All right, there you go.  Sorry. 
[04:27:00]  Thanks.  So, this son of a bitch comes down.  I never said nothing to him.  I just, you know, some comedians kiss their asses, you know.  Yeah.  Especially, he was filming, so there were certain comedians, Godfrey,  that were just, you know, sticking their faces in.  And I never said nothing to him.  One night, he says something to me.  I say something back.  I feel like we build up a rapport.  Rapport?  You know what I mean?  Like, it was organic.  What did he say? Excuse me?  Yeah. 
[04:27:30]  What's the code?  Because there's a door code to get down.  Is this seat taken?  Well, you know, it was kind of like a little conversation we had.  Yeah.  So, the next day...  What was it about, Bob?  Was it something like...  All right, so it wasn't that much of a conversation,  but it was enough for me to maybe say hi to him again.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  He said...  Did he ask why you were looking at that midget and crying?  Ooh.  Is that the first time he's done it?  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh. 
[04:28:00]  All right.  What is that?  I'll never live that down.  No, you won't.  And you wonder why I fuck syncs.  So, I went and I did this gig up in Buffalo two days later.  The worst gig of my life.  I have to hire my own driver to pick me up to drive me to the gig.  Ooh.  This guy picks me up in a van, one of those cool vans with the captain seats and the TV and the VCR. 
[04:28:30]  Nice.  So, he's got every Seinfeld episode ever, ever, ever, ever, and he's got headphones on and he's not watching and he's listening to them.  Jesus.  This guy's a Seinfeld freak.  This guy's a Seinfeld freak.  So, we go, we're driving to the gig.  He's telling me about Seinfeld.  He finds out I'm a comedian.  He starts calling me Jerry.  Oh, jeez.  Oh.  I took him out to, we went to lunch, you know, because we had like an hour to kill. 
[04:29:00]  Yeah.  So, the whole time he's telling me about, you know, his family and he's, you know, he's like, Jerry.  And I'm like, Bob.  He's like, oh, I know, but I just really like Jerry.  So, I'm like, okay, call me Jerry.  Oh, my God.  That's weird.  Did he ask you to listen to an audio cassette of his stand-up and put you on his show?  Jerry.  Jerry.  So.  Ma.  Nice talking to you.  So, this guy, this guy asked me for an autograph.  But, you know, I was like, you know what? 
[04:29:30]  I might be able to get you one.  Because I just talked to him the other night for the first time, me and my new buddy.  Yeah.  So, then I go to do this gig.  It's outside, after a band, in the rain, in the afternoon, next to a skydiving simulator, at a beer fest.  So, how was the gig?  It was all right.  It wasn't that bad.  You pulled it off.  So.  This gig was hell.  So, I go back to New York. 
[04:30:00]  I met this guy.  I mean, I lived this Seinfeld episode.  Yeah.  This guy, the whole gig with the thing and the flight simulator.  I can't wait to see Jerry and tell him the gig, you know, tell him about the gig.  So, the first time we talked, we made a bet.  I was making bets and he jumped in on the bet.  So, I owed him a buck because he won the bet.  That's why that was our conversation.  Oh, okay.  So, he's on stage.  Do you remember what the bet was?  Yeah.  It was if Gretzky was on the team that when the Rangers won the Stanley Cup. 
[04:30:30]  And no, he wasn't.  All right.  And so, he walks off stage and I got my dollar out and there's like a crowd of people going  nuts.  He walks by me at the foot of the stairs in the cellar and I go, here's your buck.  You won the bet.  And he looks at me with like, I almost think that, you know, he could smell dog shit but  he doesn't know where it is.  Look.  And he took the buck, which kind of annoyed me that he took the buck. 
[04:31:00]  Of course.  And he didn't say nuts.  All right.  Don't worry about it.  He took it.  Yeah.  I go, but I got a story for you first.  He goes, you want your buck back?  So, in my head, I'm like, what a fucking dick.  And then he walks up two stairs and he turns around and he goes, I'll be upstairs in the  back corner eating.  So, when you're done, come up and we'll talk upstairs.  So, I go, all right, man.  I'll be up.  I'm doing my set. 
[04:31:30]  Right after my set, I'll come up.  We'll sit.  We'll talk.  He goes, not you.  He was talking to the lady next to me.  I was so, you understand, there was a crowd of people there.  The lady next to me looked at me like, I'm sorry.  Oh, God.  And then he just walked up the stairs.  How embarrassing.  Oh, for that split second, you're like, oh, my God, Jerry's inviting me up to his table. 
[04:32:00]  I'm going to hang.  And then, not you.  Just the fact that I assumed that he would invite me from two sentences to sitting down and  having food with the guys.  Right.  And I'm like, yeah, I'll be right.  I said it so confident, too.  I was like, dude, I've got to do my set.  But right when I'm done with my set, I'll be up and I'll join you.  And then we'll talk about stories.  I've got to do my craft.  Not you.  And that Jew voice. 
[04:32:30]  That is just big, fat lips.  It's just not you.  That's a good story.  Oh, that rings through my head.  Oh, of course it does.  If someone says, not you, it rings through my fucking head.  You know how embarrassing it is when you're walking down the street and someone waves and  goes, hey.  And you wave back.  And then you realize it's somebody behind you that they're waving at.  It's the worst feeling.  And you're all embarrassed.  It's got to be that times a thousand. 
[04:33:00]  It's Jerry Seinfeld.  And you're in front of people.  And that is the worst.  When Colin told me that, I couldn't stop laughing and feeling bad for you.  I cried like you at a midget wedding.  Dude, let me tell you something.  In my head, in like a split second, I literally saw myself being on his new show.  I'm the new Kramer.  And I was just a superstar.  For a split second.  Colin Norton, Colin, just blowing him off. 
[04:33:30]  Jerry's inviting me to his table.  This is great.  All right.  I'll be up right after I do my set.  I finally made it.  Like Jerry will tell people about Bob.  Like, oh, you've got to sit and talk to this guy.  He's out of his mind.  He's crazy.  Yeah.  Bob, they've offered me a show.  And I need a help.  I need a writer.  Just like Larry was on Seinfeld.  I'd like you to be on this new project I'm working on.  Yeah, we need a professional person who knows about eating ass and all those. 
[04:34:00]  And effing sanks.  Maybe you could be the tear Nazi.  The tear Nazi.  People come in with a sad story.  You just cry and they walk out of your stomach.  God forbid I show emotion to a little girl who can't touch her face.  Little girl?  She was a woman.  Just happened to be a two foot tall.  We finally got the audio of that.  We're going to play it after the break, by the way.  Finally.  We've been looking for that audio for weeks.  All right, Bob.  We're going to let you go.  We might call you back because I think we're going to play the midget audio as well today. 
[04:34:30]  All right, guys.  I love all you guys.  You're the best, Bob.  Not you.  You're the best, Bob.  See you, man.  Bye.  Bye.  There he goes, Bob Kelly.  Is that just an embarrassing story?  That's great.  Like, looking up the stairs at Jerry, looking down at you, he says, when you're done, come  on up.  We'll eat and talk.  And for that split, because you know, as a comic, he's standing there going, this is  great.  Oh, my God.  What an in. 
[04:35:00]  You know, if you're going to network with a comedian, Seinfeld's the guy that you want  to network with.  The guy, you know, took stand-up comedy and turned it into what every stand-up comic wants.  The most successful sitcom in history, you know?  And there he is, ready to go.  All the fantasies rushing through Bob's head.  Oh, yeah.  I'm going to do this.  I'm going to tell.  The friends he's going to tell.  He's thinking about the friends he's going to tell that he hung out with Jerry.  And he invited him up to his table.  And the comedians that will see him walking in.  Right.  Like, we're all walking in, and there's Bob at Seinfeld's table, chatting, having some 
[04:35:30]  fun.  Right.  Jerry throwing his head back, laughing at Bob's banter.  Bob.  And Bob going, dude, I just can't do it.  I can't give you six weeks, Jerry.  I can't.  It's impossible.  It's impossible.  And then in that split second, in that split second, not you.  Because the comedy cellar, when you walk out of the showroom, you can make a right to leave 
[04:36:00]  or the steps up to the left will take you up to the olive tree.  And it's very cramped.  Yeah.  And everybody, if Seinfeld was speaking, everybody is silently listening.  Of course.  Everyone heard it.  What a wonderfully horrible story.  Oh, dude, it's just awful.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  Yeah.  Hi.  This is Nathaniel, and this is where Robert Kelly fucks a sink, and you can tell how enthusiastic  I am about this bit by the tone of my voice.  It's ONA's best bits.  Yeah. 
[04:36:30]  Mark from Virginia.  What's up?  Hey, man.  I got to defend little Jimmy.  What's that, fella?  Hey, I got to defend little Jimmy, man.  You're the man.  Without you, man, that wouldn't be a great show.  ONA, you got a great show, man, but you got to keep little Jimmy in there.  Thank you.  We're keeping little Jimmy.  Well, Jimmy's not going anywhere.  I don't want to get fired.  We just want him to fart less.  That's all.  Hey, man, he's got to relieve some pressure from somehow.  He can't just whip out his mule and do it right there in the show.  Thank you, sir.  That's exactly what... 
[04:37:00]  And I get very excited sometimes.  It just sneaks out.  I don't mean to ruin the show.  There you go, man.  He pops...  You're my idol, little Jimmy.  Thank you, buddy.  He pops boners all the time.  So what?  It's all those are good things.  Dude, but you have to show everyone.  He gets our attention and he grabs onto it.  We're trying to enjoy the freaking 20-year-old stripper from L.A.  And all of a sudden, we're all like, whoa, what has he got?  And then we're looking at your hog again.  You don't have to look.  Well, when you're jumping up and down like you might have something...  I don't jump.  I just kind of point and you guys choose to look. 
[04:37:30]  I don't jump.  He definitely tries to get your attention.  He lifts it over the edge of the console.  And rests it.  Grabs, pulls it sideways, and shakes it a little.  Yeah.  I want a little extension built around his area.  A mule hider?  Yes.  Like a sneeze guard for a...  Exactly.  A mule guard?  A mule guard?  Look, it's a perfect height where he can just plop it on the table.  It does.  He lays it on there.  I do rub it against this thing.  It's perfect.  I'll have some of the Norton wiener.  You can't out-gay Norton, though. 
[04:38:00]  No, it's not a gay thing when I do that.  I'm usually turned out by a woman.  It's not like I'm just...  You can't.  He'll try to hug me or something.  I understand what Bob Kelly's saying, though.  Yeah.  You know, out-gay.  I mean, you like to try to get that reaction by doing something that would be perceived as  gay.  No, I don't.  One time, I actually...  You know, he does gay things once in a while, and it freaks you out.  And one time, I was like, you know what?  I'm going to out-gay him.  And I actually...  You can't out-gay him.  I stuck my finger right near his butt, and he actually stopped and backed up, and my finger  went in his asshole, and I just... 
[04:38:30]  How many knuckles did he get in there?  It was one and a half.  Yeah.  It was like a little shrimp.  I could actually bend my finger.  I did not back into it.  He just stopped me.  And then he went like this.  Ooh.  He tried to put his finger by my ass, and it's like, look, you're going to learn a lesson  the hard way.  Why is your pants down at this point?  No, no, no.  My pants were on.  Easy, easy, Opie.  Why didn't you get a finger down?  We were just walking in the hallway of the apartment.  We were dressed.  I asked how many knuckles you took.  You took a knuckle and a half through the jean?  I would actually take something real, enhance it, exaggerate it.  Therein lies the ha-ha. 
[04:39:00]  Yeah, he didn't mean it.  I didn't mean I stuck my finger in his ass.  That would be gay, wouldn't it?  He put it against my ass, and I just backed up against it to teach him who was boss.  He learned a lesson.  Well, you should have told me it was exaggerated humor.  We don't know.  I thought that's what humor was.  Not all the time.  Really?  What's the other type of humor?  Dude, we've all seen him naked, so it was quite possible that that actually happened.  I've seen him naked.  Don't look at me like I'm an alien.  That's an exaggeration, too.  I've never seen Jimmy naked.  There you go.  All right, show him your hug.  No, I won't show him my hug.  I don't want to see Jimmy naked.  I love the face he gets when he gets...  I was actually with him one time, and he gets this face. 
[04:39:30]  His eyes just open wide, and his head turns down, and his upper lip goes underneath his  back tooth, and he just looks like a little troll, and he just doesn't blink, like Christopher  Walken in a scene, and he just stares at the girl like, yeah.  Yeah, that is nasty.  Oh, he does.  It's just evil.  He is.  His little body.  All right.  You know, no one's really screening the calls today.  The behind-the-scenes people are very, very slow. 
[04:40:00]  Everyone's tired today.  We're all tired.  Hello, who's this?  Oh, that was good.  A hang-up.  I was on that line.  I'm going to do it myself.  Hello, who's this?  Hello?  Hey.  Oh, it's...  Oh.  What?  Hey, Opie?  Yeah.  Oh, what's going on?  Hi, fella.  I was going to set up for a...  What did I learn?  But it's a little too early.  Yeah.  I was going to hold on...  Hold for a while, but...  You were going to hope to hold for about 45 minutes?  I guess so. 
[04:40:30]  I'll do one a little early.  For some reason, Jimmy Norton plays Monster Rain just fine, but today, a little sticky banana  juice got his nerves up for some reason.  Yeah, that's true.  It is, all right, inconsistent, but it freaked me out.  I didn't know what it was.  It was probably sitting in the deli or something, and God knows what those savages spill on  their fruit.  By the way, we did get a brand new Monster Rain song.  How many is that?  This is at least...  Number four?  Oh, my God.  It's not that...  It's...  It's...  It's bad.  Is it bad?  Listen, we'll all judge.  All right.  Another Monster Rain song.  We weren't going to go to it, but the guys are kind of asleep behind the scenes today, 
[04:41:00]  so...  That's right.  Look at them.  Look at them.  They're not even moving.  They all...  You know what it is?  They want to be punished.  They need discipline.  This damn Rent Boys thing has backfired.  Now everybody's fucking off, hoping to get a reading.  Steve records the thing in stereo.  We need the phones screened.  Isn't it obvious we're suffering here?  Yeah, we're tired, Ben.  Get fucking people on the phones.  I'm not even kidding anymore.  Get them on the phone, Ben.  No one is screening the calls, really.  It's like...  Like, slow motion.  Get my mother back on the phone. 
[04:41:30]  Have her do that...  It's been the same.  We got...  We got six phone lines ringing.  We got two guys that have been sitting, and...  And it's nothing we want to go to.  It's boring shit.  Here's the Monster Rain song.  Tell me when to stop.  Let's give a listen.  It really is bad.  Let's listen along.  Oh.  Neil Diamond.  Done to Neil Diamond.  Love on the porch. 
[04:42:00]  So far, so good.  I was surprised.  Little drizzle.  Out came his lies.  What?  Come run with me.  It's getting a little abstract, I think.  You took my heart. 
[04:42:30]  You took my soul.  Real lines.  Gave me a little tea.  Then played with my own.  Brian.  Innocent's gone, but I gave Jimmy his smile.  It's a little rough.  Give it like 30 more seconds.  Big card.  First, the skies, they're talking. 
[04:43:00]  Then Jimmy starts his talking.  Suddenly, you're under the porch.  Hiding from the storm.  The fear makes him have you.  Then he wants to have you.  Nothing you can do or say.  Once he starts, you have to stay.  It's the Monster Rain. 
[04:43:30]  This guy's all over the place.  Did we end it?  End it?  Gave me what I need.  Yeah, he's breaking all the rules.  Gave me no choice.  Breaking all the parody rules.  Yeah.  He's really singing.  Song's parody rules are like, first of all, you've got to be able to hear what you're saying.  There's a couple of lines there that are a little...  Wuffled.  Yeah, you couldn't really hear it.  Second one, you don't use that many of the lines from the real song. 
[04:44:00]  Right.  The guy's using too many of the real words to the song.  It's like a parody slash audition for, like, as a real singer.  Yeah, yeah.  Neil Diamond cover band.  Yeah.  Well, it's dugout Doug.  Did you ever come up with...  He does a pretty good Neil Diamond.  I'll say.  Did you ever have a Monster Rain story?  Did you come up with one yet?  No.  You heard my story, right?  No.  What was yours?  Oh, you weren't listening the other day.  He had the marshmallow in the frat house.  Which people are saying is just as bad as the Monster Rain.  Of course it is.  I was out in Arizona last week.  I missed the whole show. 
[04:44:30]  It's one of those things where you're hazing for a fraternity, and one of the things you  had to do is pull the pants down, pick up a marshmallow with his ass, and drop it on  a little mock...  A rivalry fraternity house.  Frat house.  And then no one ate it?  No.  No, you sick ass.  Come on.  But it's a room full of guys with their pants down.  It's a room full of guys with their pants down, picking up things with their buttholes.  Look who says that, the guy that put a finger in my ass.  Well, he didn't. 
[04:45:00]  Well, I guess Mike Cracky did.  No, you had your pants on.  Yeah, but I felt the actual shrimp haul, the actual...  Separation.  Yeah, the separation.  I'm guessing there's a Bob Kelly story.  That bomb you?  I thought it was a little odd that frats do things like that and have guys in these nude  circumstances doing things.  Yeah, I think it's a little...  There's definitely a Bob Kelly story.  Yeah, there's definitely a Bob Kelly story.  Now, let me just get this straight.  Is it like just pure molestation?  Does it have to be a guy or can it be a girl or an aunt?  No, we all have girl stories. 
[04:45:30]  How old would the boy be and how old would the aunt be?  Oh, jeez.  What the hell is an aunt?  I don't like it either, but I'm just going with the story.  It's from Boston.  I'm from aunt.  It's an aunt.  Aunt.  What do you say, aunt?  Yeah, aunt.  If I say aunt, then he's going to go what?  And then it's going to be like a whole pack of things.  Who's on first?  Aunt?  Oh, marshmallios.  Listen.  My aunt, aunt.  What?  What?  What?  Aunt?  I've done a couple things.  I guess we were talking about things that could be that looked at as, yeah. 
[04:46:00]  A little gee.  A little gay.  A little gee.  Well, I used to...  I got shards of glass.  I know.  You broke a CD and it just made shards.  You all right?  Yeah, I'll be all right.  That's what you get.  All right.  Relax.  Easy.  I should settle down, huh?  Settle down.  Now, what do you got down?  Why don't you settle down?  Find a girl like Henry.  Tell us your gay story.  What?  Well, it's not gay.  Only the good half.  It's not gay because it was young.  It's not every night, huh?  It was young.  You were young. 
[04:46:30]  Yeah.  Well, that's the whole monster ain't excuse Jimmy gives is it's not gay because he was young.  Well, it's true.  Everybody, four out of five young boys have done stuff with their buddies' peepees when  they're young because you don't know what sex is yet.  And the fifth one watches.  That's what my therapist told me.  Really?  Yeah, that it's pretty natural.  Really?  Well, when you were, how old were you and whatever?  So, I guess I'm not normal.  Oh, yeah, you are.  You're so normal, you probably repressed it.  There's a normal memory in there.  I honestly couldn't give you one, though.  It's going to come out someday. 
[04:47:00]  I don't know.  I forgot all about the marshmallow story, so I guess we'll see.  I'm sure there's more in there.  All right, go ahead.  How old were you?  How old was I?  I think I was, I had to be in first grade.  First grade.  First grade.  That's six.  Actually, yeah, it was before first grade.  My first sexual experience with a woman was in first grade with this chick, the blouse.  This local whore.  And she made me suck.  Whore?  Yeah, the blouse.  How old was she?  She was like, she had to be like 14.  Oh.  So, she was older and she took me in the bushes.  Yeah.  And made me suck on her tits. 
[04:47:30]  And then she played with my little mushroom.  Like, she just played with it.  Wow.  And I went home.  What a little whore.  I actually cried all night because I thought God was going to punish me.  And he was going to.  And he did.  What a good Catholic.  I remember me and my...  You cried all night because of that?  Well, you know, I was raised Catholic.  That's horrendous.  Of course.  And I didn't know she's touching me and I'm sucking on...  She made me do this stuff.  I was molested.  You were molested.  And then I went home that night and I was just crying in my bed. 
[04:48:00]  Just crying, praying for God.  Please forgive me.  I'm sorry.  This is bad.  Are you kidding?  My mother actually came up.  She was like, honey, what's wrong?  I was like, nothing.  I'm just...  You know, I had a bad dream and I just cried all night.  I just felt bad.  Thank you, man.  Sorry.  I just had to, you know, make this story a little more fun.  Yeah.  Porn.  Porn.  Porn.  All right.  So you're crying in bed.  Let dirty boy finish your story.  Well, you know, it's funny.  It's like a week later, I actually... 
[04:48:30]  You do understand it was your fault.  It was my fault.  Yeah.  Why?  It was your fault.  She took me into the bush.  She made me...  Looking all sexy.  What are you expecting to parade that little hairless jewel around?  Who wouldn't touch it for Pete's sake?  She used to take me into Tufts University.  And after that, I kind of got into it.  And I used to grab my friend, Matthew.  We used to go up into the attic of Tufts University.  And just each one of us would...  She was fat.  Just fat and huge stitch.  And each one of us would just suck on a tit. 
[04:49:00]  Wow.  Like little babies.  Like little...  You were little babies.  Yeah.  It was just this hot, sweaty attic.  And this fat chick.  And she was just sweating.  And me and him would just both grab one of our huge tits and just suck on a tits.  And was she getting pleasure out of this?  Was she moaning or something?  No, not really.  She would just sit there.  Sometimes she'd smoke during it.  I swear to God, she'd just let up a cigarette.  It was weird.  Like, she would just do it with everybody.  My first three chicks were just fat, white chicks.  The Blouse, Kimba, and some other chick. 
[04:49:30]  I don't remember that.  Kimba, yeah.  She would just...  Where's the guy thing come in?  Oh, when I was before...  No, you know when it was after that.  You're trying to tell chick stories, and you're like, where's the guy stuff?  Yeah.  I kind of like the The Blouse story.  Yeah, thanks, man.  That was nice.  I mean, Ope.  Sorry.  Nice talking to you.  Wanted to, you know, keep you on track.  All right.  Well, you know what happened is that me and my friend, we would go over to...  He would come over to my house, because both of my parents worked,  and my sister would be out, so we'd just lie on the couch.  Uh-oh.  That's already...  All right.  And...  Oh, boy. 
[04:50:00]  Buckle up.  Buckle up.  This is...  Here comes another monster rain.  This is way beyond monster rain.  I can sense it.  I don't know why you call it monster rain.  Why don't you just call it sucking each other's cocks and being friends?  Well, the more I look at it, the more I realize that there probably was no such thing  as monster rain.  I've come to that conclusion.  Oh, really?  Are you backing out of stuff now?  What are you saying?  No.  I didn't know that you guys grew up together.  No, easy.  What I was saying was...  If me and him were buddies when we were a kid, we'd have some...  Dude, remember that time I banged you in your ass? 
[04:50:30]  All right.  All right.  Listen.  We wouldn't have a story like that.  That wasn't gay, though.  I talked to my therapist.  That's not gay.  We just didn't know any better.  We're friends, you know?  We didn't know.  All right.  So...  So you and your friend would lie on the couch?  We'd lie on the couch.  This was before I...  How old was he?  Uh, 13.  How old were you?  No, I'm joking.  He was...  Ah, shit.  We had to be...  We had to be...  How old were you in fifth grade?  How old were you in fifth grade?  11.  I don't know.  It depends on what color you are.  No, not 11.  11?  No, it wasn't 11.  What color are you...  Oh, my God.  You were 11 years old.  Hang on.  I didn't even hear that.  That's so bad.  That's good. 
[04:51:00]  You were 11.  I wasn't...  Opie, it's not 11, because I was in...  You graduate sixth grade and you're 12 years old, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  So you're 11 in fifth grade.  It must have been...  You were 11.  I was in fourth grade, then.  I wasn't 11, because I started drinking at 11, 10 or 11, and I wasn't drinking then.  Of course you started drinking.  This is my first addiction.  This is my first addiction.  Then I moved on to booze.  So what happened when you were almost a teenager?  You're laying on the couch.  You lie on the couch.  You just lie there.  And this is when... 
[04:51:30]  Remember when you first started jerking off, you used Vaseline?  Yes.  Remember petroleum jelly?  Sure.  You would waterproof your dick for three days.  Yes.  Just jump in the shower to wash it off, and it would just beat up.  Yeah.  Just looking for anything slippery at that age.  Didn't matter.  Run around like a monkey.  Just looking, what?  Pancake batter?  I don't care.  Whatever works.  I jerk off with anything.  Anything.  Anything.  I used to jerk off with the Juergens, and I'd fuck the sink.  You ever fuck the sink?  I can't say I've ever done that.  If you ever want to jerk off, and it feels like you're fucking somebody, you get on... 
[04:52:00]  You know the big, long sinks in the bathroom, the counter?  Yeah.  Right?  Yeah.  You have to have...  You can't have like a pedestal sink.  How small is your dick?  Listen to me.  It's a sink.  Wait.  It's the way you pull the little thing out that seals your drain up?  No.  No.  You don't fuck the sink sink.  Well, you lie on the counter.  It has to be a counter with the sink in the middle.  Oh, oh.  You lie down, and you put your hand here.  It's almost like a ditch in the...  It's a ditch, and you put your hand on the edge.  You lube up your hand, and you push your hand in, and then your hand is stationary. 
[04:52:30]  And it all goes in the sink.  And you get to fuck, and then it goes right in the sink.  It's unbelievable.  You are a genius.  Oh, it's unbelievable.  It really feels like you're fucking somebody.  I swear to God.  I'm not going to be able to look at a sink ever again.  No.  That is brilliant, because there's no cleanup.  You're getting...  You're able to use your whole body in it.  You open your eyes, and you're looking right at yourself in the mirror.  How fucking creepy is that?  There's a fat, bald chick I'm fucking.  I got caught in rehab. 
[04:53:00]  When I went to rehab, I got caught fucking the sink.  I used to fuck the sink during our group sessions, because I know everybody was in the group.  So one time, I guess, somebody snapped in group, and they had to end group early.  And I'm in the bathroom fucking the sink, and there was like a crack in the door.  And all of a sudden, I just hear giggling, and all 10 guys from my rehab house were in  there.  They were just watching me fuck the sink.  It was just awful.  So you still do that?  I haven't done it, because I have a pedestal sink now. 
[04:53:30]  You can't do that.  Yeah, you can't do that.  I'm too fat to balance myself on a pedestal sink.  But yeah, I've done it.  I've done it in hotel rooms.  You ever go in the hotels?  You have to go in the cheesy hotels, but the suite in a cheesy hotel always has that  big, long counter with one sink, a little sink in the middle.  Perfect.  Just jump up on top.  You lube your hand up.  Don't lube your dick up.  No?  No, because you want to lube just the inside of your hand.  Put it on there.  And then when you push it in, it's like cracking the seal of a real pussy.  What the hell is going on? 
[04:54:00]  You want a little resistance.  You want a little resistance, because it cracks it, and you're like, oh, and it feels  like you're cracking the seal of a stink wrinkle just as it's going in.  Oh, it's unbelievable.  Right now, there's a sink in therapy somewhere.  I just wanted to clean people and help and wash them, and this fat kid would climb on  and put a stinky in my face.  Well, I was in the bathroom where I usually am, and the light came on.  These are great distractions.  So what happened with the guy on the couch?  Yeah, it's true. 
[04:54:30]  Locking the sink.  So you were almost a teenager, naked with another boy.  And you pretended...  There's no naked, yes.  That wasn't...  Wait a minute, Ovi.  I love...  You are such a fucking magician.  You said fifth grade.  You said almost a teenager.  I know, but throw the teen out.  I'm still a young boy.  You're still young.  You're a master at that, and I know what you're doing.  Dude, fifth grade.  Because all these...  Fifth grade is 11.  Could be 11 and a half.  That's close to a teenager.  All these truck drivers are hearing it's teenager, boy, man.  There you go.  I played Monster Rain, and you played Use My Mouth Like a Sink.  All right, go ahead.  Yeah.  So let's go. 
[04:55:00]  Well, I would...  We would just lie on the couch.  Mommy's gone for the day.  Gone for the day, and we'd lie on the couch, and we'd pull each other's pants down, and  then he would jerk off, and I would jerk off with the Vaseline.  But then...  Oh, God.  But then...  Oh, God.  Go ahead.  Are you ready?  Yeah.  It's not gay, because you're too young to know.  Yeah, you're too young to know what's going on.  Meanwhile, you've got the DVD player working.  Pull your shoulder belt tight.  Let me tell you something.  I've never paid $250 to, you know, repeat this while I was older. 
[04:55:30]  It's never happened.  I...  Nothing.  Good.  Oh, my God.  No, we got it.  Nice talking to you.  I...  So, we would jerk off, and after a while, it's like when you're in a pool, and you play  one game, and it's like, ah, what's...  You start just making up anything.  We're going to, you know, duck, eat, nander, and throw her in the pool, and whoever...  If she drowns, you lose.  If you save her, you win.  I'm bored with Marco Polo, so...  Yeah, exactly.  Marco...  Oh! 
[04:56:00]  So, that was it.  There it is.  So, uh...  Yeah, so...  You're getting bored.  So, you're getting bored just cranking it with each other.  Yeah, so you get bored, you're just cranking it out, and you were so young, nothing's coming  out.  You're kind of pretending.  You know what I mean?  You ever have...  Oh, okay.  That's...  That's going to be the savior, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's going to pull you out of this.  Yeah, I'm just saying.  This is what annoyed me, is that my friend was older than me, so he could actually blow  a load, and I remember being so self-conscious, and one time I got a marshmallow, and I 
[04:56:30]  mushed it up in my hand, and I put, like, little daubs, so I was like, I came  too, because, uh...  Really?  Well, I just...  I was so...  Oh, man!  Dude, you're now starting to scare me.  What, dude?  I just wanted to...  You're a freak.  I wanted to blow a load.  It's like, you want to be part of the crew.  You didn't get that marshmallow from a frat house, did you?  No?  Actually, it looked like it had been roasted over a fire for five seconds.  Yeah.  You have a blonde, bang, gorgeous guy actually pulled up and gave me a marshmallow.  I... 
[04:57:00]  Get it?  Nice.  Got it.  Oh, so, uh...  You faked it.  No, I didn't fake it.  I think by this time I could actually...  No, I couldn't.  I couldn't.  Well, you could put the marshmallow on the floor.  All right, listen.  How long were you guys doing this?  Yeah, how many years?  How many years?  Well, he would come over every once in a while, but...  Well, I was bummed when he left for college.  He still drops by.  He comes to the game.  Did I just say something, though?  You said too much.  I see him every once in a while.  No.  I'm so open with it.  I've talked about it.  I remember when I went to rehab, the guy brought me in. 
[04:57:30]  This guy brought me in.  He goes, tell me the worst thing you've never told anybody.  And I was like, this is the story I told him.  I go, I've never...  This is what I carry around with me.  Right.  My whole life that makes me feel like a piece of shit.  And he goes, everybody's done that.  And he goes, I've done it.  And he goes, go get Mark, John, and Billy in here.  And they all come in.  Hey, you ever jerk off with your friend?  You ever touch your friend's cock when you were young?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  See?  He goes, it's not that bad.  Everybody does that.  And I was like, hey, you guys, you know.  Then we all went and jerked each other off. 
[04:58:00]  No, I'm just kidding.  So you got bored with Marco Polo.  Stop going off track here.  Good point, Ope.  Thank you.  Good point.  Thank you, Jimmy.  Keep him on track.  Way to keep him focused.  And that's why you're here, Ope.  That's why I'm a radio genius.  You are.  What happened now?  Yeah, you're a little bored.  So you get a little bored.  Fuck slow.  And I felt weird, too, because I was definitely the bottom.  Oh, okay.  All right.  What the hell?  You were more the feminine one in this relationship?  Faking it to keep him happy?  Not feminine.  It was more like...  He was the take charge kind of guy. 
[04:58:30]  Well, I was younger.  You know?  Yeah.  I was the younger kid, so I was...  All right.  I was the learner.  He was the teacher.  So what then happened?  So then he would be like, why don't you grab mine and play with mine?  Ah, there you go.  So I would grab it, but I grabbed it like this.  Oh, because doing it upside down doesn't make it gay.  No, because I'm not at all.  You know, so I did it like the way men jerk off other men.  I was going to do it, but I didn't really want to commit, so I did it this way.  You know what I mean, right, guys?  Summon forefinger against the body. 
[04:59:00]  No, it's not that.  That keeps it away from God.  It's just that I'm dyslexic, so I went on his.  I went upside down.  Yeah, upside down.  No, I just didn't know how to grab another man.  I never grabbed, so I knew how to grab mine, but it was like, how do I grab it?  He's like, no, do it this way.  Yeah, I guess you would grab it the same way, right?  You know what's so funny, too, is that he had a retarded baby brother, and his brother  came in.  Oh, no.  And he...  Oh, what a mess that month.  No, no, no.  He didn't come in while we were doing this.  He came in...  Oh, man.  Jesus. 
[04:59:30]  You know after this session, you're going to leave us a check, right?  A check for what?  The therapy.  Getting this off your chest.  Getting this off your chest.  Well, he's taking over the whole show.  His little brother came in, and he had a huge, just a retarded talk.  Well, we've talked about that.  All retards have huge retarded eyes.  And he had pubes, and he was younger than me.  I had no pubes, and I had this...  The internet is for porn.  Thank you, Ed.  Keep it fun, Ed.  Keep it fun.  Keep it fun.  Porn, porn, porn. 
[05:00:00]  Yes, Bob.  So, anyways, he actually, he actually, he goes, put it in your mouth.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  The retard dick?  No, not the retard dick.  I couldn't fit that in my mouth.  Oh, we've gotten to that point.  So, anyways, I put it in...  How many chapters?  Huh?  How many chapters to this story?  Oh, no.  What chapter are we up to?  No, you didn't.  You didn't.  Well, I...  You must have known that that was much more wrong than just cranking in front of each other. 
[05:00:30]  I swear to God, I didn't.  I was too young.  I didn't know.  No, I know.  So, what happened?  I swear to God.  He said, put it in my mouth, and you did.  I put it in, and it tasted like...  It was like just...  It didn't...  It just like feet.  Tasted like feet?  Yeah, like it just tastes...  Do you ever suck your toes when you're a kid?  Like bite your toenails?  No, I didn't.  You never bit your toenails?  I do constantly, but I never compared that to a cock.  Oh, my God.  He's telling us what...  Well, you didn't bite the dickhead, did you?  Like...  No.  I just remember it was like...  It was spongy. 
[05:01:00]  Ant's brain is short-circuit.  A spongy foot.  He's talking.  He's telling what it feels like to have another man's dick in his mouth.  It's not a man.  It's a...  It's a kid.  It doesn't make it any better when I say it's a kid.  You were almost 13.  Yeah.  Did he have hair?  I wouldn't let him do it to me, though, because he had braces, and it scared me.  All right, so at least you were old enough to make the pain association...  Give the old payback.  Well, you know what?  It's not gay, guys.  It's not gay.  It's just...  Listen to me. 
[05:01:30]  No, we believe you.  Guys, look at me in the eye.  I can't.  I can't.  Everybody's looking at the wall, and it's making me feel bad.  You have...  Yeah, you're on your own.  No, I can't even look at you.  Opie, look at me.  No.  I'm looking for a...  Anthony, look at me.  That's right.  You're a little bitch.  That's right.  You're a bitch, and I bet you'd like to suck it, wouldn't you?  We just want this to go away now.  Yes, I am gay.  Well, I actually...  Can I tell you about the retard story?  Those men wanted to have sex with me.  You have to.  I...  Can I just recover?  This...  I used to have this...  Huh?  What?  She wasn't retarded. 
[05:02:00]  She was like that dumb...  No, we don't want to hear it if this is she in it.  Yeah, she's...  Yeah, but she was retarded.  You're stupid!  She was retarded, though.  Yeah!  Stop laughing at me!  Stop laughing at me!  You stop laughing at me!  I am...  I'm sorry!  You stop laughing at me!  Audio from the Kelly's basement.  She used to follow me home every day, and one day, I actually... 
[05:02:30]  You didn't have sex with a retard.  Well, one day...  There's actually two stories.  I brought her...  She brought me home.  I mean, I brought her home.  She followed me home.  This is where we get the gay out of the show, Anthony.  Yeah.  Sex with retards, only on the O.B. and Anthony show.  Take a promo out of that.  She used to follow me home.  I think it was seventh grade.  So one time, I let her come home with me, because my mom was out.  Was she...  How retarded was she?  Was she a slow girl in school, or was she like...  Did she have a...  She was the fat kid, the fat girl with the greasy hair and the straight bangs. 
[05:03:00]  I was going to say, the Pete Rose haircut?  Yeah.  All right, pretty retarded.  But was she...  But she wasn't, like, her body...  She wasn't mongoloid?  She had, like, a big...  Like, a silverback gorilla forehead.  Like, it's long, but short and angled.  I gotcha.  And, uh...  But not Down syndrome.  Little volcano tits.  You know what I mean?  A fat gut, but just volcano tits.  I was in seventh grade, so...  I don't know.  You were 13.  13.  Now you're officially a teenager.  You moved on from sucking men off to having sex with retards.  And you wonder why you're in therapy. 
[05:03:30]  Trying to cleanse the palate.  Right.  Literally speaking.  When did you finally get up to Hot Chicks?  Last year?  No.  Yeah.  Actually, around 20.  20.  When I got sober, I finally got...  I was like, great.  This is great.  The sober thing, really.  Why is every comedian recovering something?  Because they have experiences like this that you've got to drink away.  Exactly.  Exactly.  The second you were sober, before you got sober.  Yeah.  I mean, like, before you got a drink that day.  Yeah.  Would these things just creep in and you were like, oh, my God, I need a drink so bad? 
[05:04:00]  I used to hang out with these guys, they were all from South Medford, Italian, mafia-type  guys, all kick-ass, and I would be around them all the time and have these thoughts would  enter my head, and I would get so uncomfortable, it almost came out.  Like, I just wanted to, like, tell them.  If they only knew, they would throw me out of this little...  Oh, I'd be killed.  They'd beat the hell out of me.  All right, so you're 13, she's 7?  No, no, no, no.  She's my age, you're a friggin' lunatic.  Stop enhancing the story.  That's why there was a question mark.  I can't believe he can make the stories worse, but he is. 
[05:04:30]  There was a question mark.  Was she 7?  I'm getting confused here.  She's older.  Oh, 7th grade.  She had the mental capacity of a 7-year-old, you sick F.  Yeah, that's true.  Did she talk all weird?  She didn't.  You're stupid!  Was it like that?  Yeah, well, yeah, she was kind of, she was like that a little bit.  So I took her back to my house.  You know, there's a guy in Ohio checking in, and I agree with him.  The show is two weeks away from a guy doing the Wiffle Ball Bat Challenge. 
[05:05:00]  No!  Dude, this has to end.  I'm really getting pissed off about this.  It's just, you know what it is?  It's therapy session.  Why does all of Jimmy's friends have to come in and admit their gay experiences?  We did kind of pull it out of him.  You sat there.  Dude, you started off like, you started off when we, I tried to sidetrack with Pussy eight times.  Yeah.  And you kept going, all right, get back to him.  We started off with one of the hottest girls we've ever had on the show.  From me?  We wanted to bow to you, and now we want to shun you, man. 
[05:05:30]  Now you realize what would happen if you bowed to him.  I'd fuck the sink.  Oh, my God.  Can we get past the sexual retard thing?  No, the retard is a girl, so.  She's a girl.  Oh, yeah.  Sure she is.  She's just a little retarded, and she claps like this.  With her wrists.  But, so I took her in the basement.  I made her jerk me off with that old, really harsh soap with the little grains of...  Lava?  Yeah, lava soap.  They wash oil off your hands.  You love punishing yourself.  Yeah, it's got granules in it. 
[05:06:00]  Yeah, right, exactly.  Ow.  She's jerking me off, but she's just, you know...  I cleaned off with the Brillo pad.  She kept going, is this how I do it?  Is this okay?  Is this okay?  It hurts in my hand.  It hurts in my hand.  Asking those same questions you were asking just a year prior.  Turn your hand over, stupid.  Easier fucking a sink.  So I looked up in the window in the basement, and I saw my mother's car pull up.  Uh-oh.  So I said, wait here, wait here, and I just ran upstairs, and my mother came home with 
[05:06:30]  my aunt, and I'm talking to her, and I'm so nervous, and then I'm sitting on the couch  watching TV, but I fell asleep.  Oh, no.  Around four hours later, I woke up.  It was dark out, and I was like, oh, my God.  I forgot all about her in the basement.  I ran around the back, and you know those tornado doors, like the angled doors for the  cellar, the basement doors?  Right, the cellar door.  I opened it up, and this poor retarded girl was just sitting there shivering.  She still had soap on her hands, the fucking cookie soap, and she's sitting there serving 
[05:07:00]  like, I got to go home.  I was supposed to be home a long time ago.  Yeah.  I got to go home.  All right, retard.  Finish the job first.  You can go.  Did you make her finish?  No, I didn't make her finish.  But another time I saw her, my friend actually held a rock overhead until she jerked both of  us off.  All right.  I like that.  Oh, my God.  You're a criminal.  I'm not me.  It was my friend.  You're an accomplice.  No, I'm not.  I told her not to do it.  No, it's not.  It's a retarded girl.  She thought it was fun.  She thought it was to hold the rock over the head.  Hey, we want to thank Bob Kelly for stopping on by today. 
[05:07:30]  Why didn't you do that?  He's on it.  Why didn't you spend all of a love?  Why didn't you do that?  You can hear more.  Why didn't you spend all of a love?  Put the rock down.

He does this when it's told.  He does this when it's told.  It's not gay if you do it thumb and forefinger first.  You've heard the Silence of the Lambs song, right?  Yes, it's very funny.

[05:10:30]  XM 202.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Paradise.  Remember that show, guys?  Sure.  Yep.  All right.  Well, Bill Burr thought it was a very funny show because Tara Reade sounds pretty unintelligent on it.  So we cut it up, played it for everybody, and Bill and Ant had a great time doing their Tara Reade impressions.  I believe these are ONA's best bits.  One of them.  Hey, you know what we haven't talked about yet?  What?  What we were talking about in the office?  About Tara Reade and all that? 
[05:11:00]  All right.  Her show, uh, Tarable.  What is it called?  Taradice.  Taradice?  Terrifying.  Oh, it's so bad.  It's amazing.  It's the old Wild On show they used to do with me.  Same thing, where they send her around.  But now it's Tara Reade, Wild On E, or whatever.  Yeah, and Brooke Burke used to talk all the time, you know, and do, like, the whole segments.  And she's so bad.  I have, like, 17 montages.  And they'll just come to her, you know, this is where life began.  And she's like, wow.  Wow.  You guys, that's amazing. 
[05:11:30]  That's crazy.  This is insane.  I took a peek the other day.  I couldn't believe how awful she looked.  And she won't do anything, either.  This is like Tara saying, I'm, no, that's crazy.  You guys.  Yeah, she's in, like, these faraway places, and she's supposed to participate in some activities,  and she doesn't.  No, she won't.  There's two episodes I've seen.  Anything that they're doing.  She was supposed to run with the bulls.  No.  No.  I was gonna, and then I was just like, I'm not gonna. 
[05:12:00]  I was just like, it's like, how are you building a show around this?  Oh, God.  And then she'll laugh, like, camel unfilters.  Yeah, she's known for just smoking like crazy, and she had that, what do they call that voice  when they want it to sound like it's something sexy?  Oh, that smoky voice?  Yeah, Demi Moore description.  Yeah, yeah, there's a way you put it that sounds sexy, and maybe when, you know, a few 
[05:12:30]  years back, when she was doing those American Pie movies, I guess, it was kind of cute.  Now, it's just reached the point where it really reminds me of Lucille Ball in her final  years when she used to do Carson.  Remember you watch I Love Lucy as a kid, and she was like, Ricky, we gotta have Mrs. Trumbull  watch Little Ricky, and I'll meet you at the club later, and that was Lucy.  And then, like, six years later, six years go by, she's on a talk show. 
[05:13:00]  Well, you know, me and Viv, when we invented the sitcom, we never really got along with Bill  Frawley.  But me and Desi started Desilu Studios.  Like, what happened to her voice?  She'd be on those talk shows with a drink and a cigarette.  The drink clinking.  No problem.  Clink, clink.  Oh, Johnny.  Just drinking and smoking. 
[05:13:30]  That is funny.  And that's definitely the road Tara Reid has taken.  She's not going to be able to talk.  The emphysema.  Yeah, they all wound up getting it back then.  She died of it.  Ricky, I remember seeing Desi Arnaz on a Saturday Night Live episode, like right before he died.  Yeah.  He was on.  I don't know.  Did he host it?  I think he was a host.  And just ravaged by the sea, the big casino got his lungs because they were always smoking. 
[05:14:00]  In the office, we were talking about the episodes of I Love Lucy where they would do placement,  product placement for Philip Morris.  It was a cigarette company that sponsored the show.  And Lucy would offer people cigarettes that came over the house in a candy dish full of  cigarettes that were on the table of a TV show.  They'd be like wafts of smoke on the set.  You know, the whole studio probably just stunk.  The set had nicotine dripping down the walls. 
[05:14:30]  You'd have to squeegee off the camera lenses.  And Tara Reid's starting to sound like, uh...  Mr. Mooney.  We're here in Papillon, Spain.  I'm not going to run with the bulls.  It's crazy.  Guys.  Well, I think we have some Tara audio here.  Yeah.  Let's listen to this.  Water activities. 
[05:15:00]  We went on this other route thing.  It was called a fly fish.  And it's like this thing where everyone kind of lays down in it.  And it just flies up in the air.  And we didn't perish.  We're screaming like...  We're so scared.  It was so hot.  I thought it was going to flip over the other way.  I think I broke my seat and my eyeballs. 
[05:15:30]  Oh my gosh.  Honestly, we really hurt each other.  And I think my leg is broken.  I have black and blue on my legs right here.  It's crazy.  But it's so much fun.  We did every water sport you could possibly imagine.  We've burnt more calories since doing water activities and not even more like here.  I think we worked out for an hour.  You do this every day.  You'd be ripped.  Wow.  People are watching this shit.  She's got one of those voices.  It's just around every...  Stop talking.  And then we went on this thing.  It's called a fly fish.  It's fantastically fun. 
[05:16:00]  Like her voice just cuts out.  It's like a cell phone call.  Here we are in Australia.  It's wonderful.  We're by the great...  Just cuts out.  Not getting a signal.  Good signal.  Sultry, people are saying the voice is called.  Sultry.  Sultry.  Mike on Long Island.  What's up, Mike?  I caught a glimpse of that show the other day.  It is the most cool show on TV. 
[05:16:30]  All she talks about is how exclusive you're getting into.  And you've got to hear the person refers to herself.  And this is the terror zone or the re-zone.  This is like really exclusive.  It's the most...  Hey, stop ripping off Anthony.  Anthony came up with the voice that just, you know, craps out.  His phone.  He's got a terrible voice.  The voice phone.  All right, Mike.  Thank you.  Here's another clip.  This is hysterical.  My camera crew comes in.  And then all these other camera crews, like flashes everywhere. 
[05:17:00]  We're like, what is going on?  It all happened at once.  And Paris and Paris are like, wow, she's a big crew.  Say hi to the camera.  I'm sitting there like, who are all these people?  It all happened so quick.  There's like eight cameras, 25 paparazzis all around the table.  And it was just like, whoa.  That's our only camera.  Paris.  Paris.  Paris.  That's the only camera allowed in.  You know, and then finally we got everyone else out.  But we kept ours in.  They figured it out.  The bodyguard just figured it out.  You nailed the voice. 
[05:17:30]  Oh, man.  She's got it.  Oh.  She tells the worst story.  Yeah.  Like.  I was like, wow.  I was like, awesome.  We got a bigger crew in Paris.  Who cares?  Wasn't the whole thing with the original show is that it was her going to bars, like party  locations?  Yeah.  And then what, did they run out of bars?  Because now they try to make it, make, make it more than it really is. 
[05:18:00]  Where she's actually trying to get culture.  Some of these places.  I have no idea.  Oof.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  I'm doing an orgasm.  Oh, no.  Oh.  Honey and cheese, my pride.  I love Greek food.  This is out of control.  Oh, my God.  I've never in my life tasted anything better.  Like, we were flipping out.  It was sick.  It was amazing.  It was so, so good.  She has, like, three adjectives in her whole vocabulary. 
[05:18:30]  It was sick.  It was amazing.  So, so good.  I mean, it was just as.  So, so, so good.  Do you need a show to have somebody tell you how delicious some food product was?  I didn't.  That's what she's talking about.  I never realized her voice was so fucked up.  Oh, raspy.  The other thing is, it all of a sudden just speeds up out of nowhere.  Yeah.  She loves the cigarettes is what it is.  She must be a mess to, like, wake up in the morning for the next show.  Just picture her sprawled out on the bed in some hotel room and, like, jizz on the sheets  and just reeking of smoke.  Jizz in her hair. 
[05:19:00]  Everything she owns must just reek of cigarette smoke.  Just her hair all in disarray or face all swollen from the night partying.  What?  Uh, I need another hour.  No, call me later.  I got sleep.  Punching the mirror.  Getting in a karate fight.  Saigon.  I can't believe I'm still in Saigon.  And then the Vietcom came in and I was like, wow. 
[05:19:30]  First and ninth air cab.  Air mobile.  I was going to blow this off, but we have to hear more of her.  It's horrible.  Of her speech.  Oh.  Paris and Paris couldn't have been any kinder.  You know, they just took us in and showed us the other side of Greece that we wouldn't  have ever gotten to know. 
[05:20:00]  River dancing and singing together.  I mean, there's just so much love there.  Paris and Paris, they're truly in love.  I think it's beautiful.  Truly what?  Paris and Paris, they're truly just...  Truly just...  She hacks up a tumor.  I think people are going to see I'm not just a party girl, but I care about people.  I'm kind of poofy and I have a funny side to me, too.  Look at this.  It's insane.  What is that?  That's the problems.  And the main building is a party room.  And what is that?  This is a man who made from the... 
[05:20:30]  So is he one of the gods?  Like her cubies?  No, no.  No, no.  That's mythology.  This is the real thing.  It was the golden age of Pericles.  Built 2,500 years ago.  So he was a guy?  Yes.  See, I'm confused.  Did you know this?  You guys don't know either.  So don't make me look really stupid.  He was the guy that built that, right?  He was like the governor back then.  And that's how democracy started.  Is he the guy that did the thing with the potatoes? 
[05:21:00]  He was like, right?  That guy was a leader.  He ruled Greece and there was no potatoes.  Anyone in the economy would be better.  I'm learning way too much stuff.  Is that like when the ruins were?  Exactly.  Okay, see?  I'm getting smarter by the minute.  It was one of the birthplaces of civilization.  And it was amazing.  Amazing.  You should stick to the good clubs.  Yeah, let's talk about the clubs.  I'm just having a word as new as I'm just consistent right now.  I don't know if she's looking like a rock scientist. 
[05:21:30]  Holy...  I don't know.  We need a translation.  I'm learning too much stuff.  I'm trying to get a history lesson.  I don't think that part of the show is very good.  Do you hear the sound effects?  They actually make fun of her because...  Yeah.  Boing.  She's so stupid.  See that one with the potatoes?  That's the one with the potatoes.  Because I know there was a leader and he had people and they ran out of potatoes and I'm going to get some more potatoes.  Is that the guy?  Is that the guy?  Hey, what is it?  Give me a fucking drink. 
[05:22:00]  I need a drink.  Fabulous.  We have Tara Reid on the phone.  Tara!  Hi, boys.  Hey, Tara.  Wow, you sound sexy with that voice.  What's up, Tara Reid?  I was out all night partying with Tara.  Hey, a bunch of my friends were telling me you guys were talking about me.  So what's going on?  What's up, Tara?  I like when they call that have no material. 
[05:22:30]  Hi, it's Tara Reid!  Again, having to say who it is and then...  Well, it had potential.  One more clip of Tara.  That's unbelievable.  Yeah, we'd like to eat dinner at least three times today.  I mean, can you tell?  I'm going to be a monster by the end of it.  Hello?  I need to honestly get my mouth stapled and just talk out of a straw.  It's all I do is eat.  I'm going to be fatter with a second.  I'm going to eat a girl.  You're going to get me in a bikini. 
[05:23:00]  I'm just a monster now.  I told myself that you've never seen me this big in your life.  I have no idea what she said.  And she just laughed.  About being fat, bikini.  Yeah, I think it's like...  If we keep eating, I'm going to get a huge amount of bikini.  I'm not going to be able to fit into it.  I'm going to have to get my mouth stapled and eat through a straw.  She didn't even say that.  She's going to breathe through a straw or something.  I don't know.  Talk through a straw.  It's like, isn't it getting your jaw wired shut and eating through a straw? 
[05:23:30]  She's like getting my mouth stapled and talking through a straw.  She gets everything wrong.  She was confusing Greek mythology with the potato famine.  And then the god Apollo needed french fries and he couldn't find any.  So he had to get a Peristophicaly's guy and he came down and actually got them curly fries.  That's amazing.  Dope.  What adult. 
[05:24:00]  That's fucking unbelievable.  I can't book anything.  She's on television.  You've got to be a train wreck, Bill.  Oh my God, I just got the side yesterday.  I didn't have to pass in there.  You guys.  She's on TV.  There it is.  God has a show.  People talk about it.  People watch it.  Encore, one more clip.  Of course.  Talking about food.  More food.  What is going on with the potato and the bread?  I mean, guys, are you trying to make me fat by the second?  I'm not eating them. 
[05:24:30]  Guys, my ass is jiggling.  You can't starve yourself and be like a typical actress that doesn't eat and do a movie that we did  because it's too intense.  Do you know what I mean?  So, literally, you ate what you could.  So, we ate stuff for energy, but it was food.  So, we got fat.  Yeah, head in the log.  But we'll get it off.  Here, you pass the Greek salad.  That's really good.  It's them eating and talking about getting fat from eating shitty food.  Honey.  The movie is, like, so intense. 
[05:25:00]  I did American Pie.  It's the dry place that I had to go.  It's the actual thing.  It's so hot.  We're eating food here.  It's such a shitty food.  I got fat.  You know, it was different on the set of my motion picture, Josie and the Pussycats.  We had some great food there.  Now, it's such horrible food.  Michael Jordan from Alabama writes,  Tara Reid actually said rock scientist instead of rocket scientist.  Rock scientist?  Yeah, I did hear that.  Fantastic.  Rock scientist. 
[05:25:30]  She is the greatest.  All right.  I'm looking forward to the next program.  We need more Tara clips.  Yeah?  Please put that on the list.  Do you want to do some Tara things?  Yeah.  All right, Tara clips on the way for you, Anthony.  Tara clips.  There you go.  Who the hell was that?  Did you hear that?  Whose stomach just growled?  Was that yours?  Yeah.  But you've been eating granola.  It was really low, though.  That wasn't my stomach.  That was one of those internal farts. 
[05:26:00]  Yeah.  Did you hear that?  Yeah, it doesn't get...  It's like, you know, your intestine...  This is a great segue.  Well...  I haven't talked about farts in a few days.  Here we go, guys.  Because your intestine is a bunch of, like, muscles, just like your sphincter, only it's  like on the whole length of it, and that pushes everything down.  So when you get gas in there, and the gas squeezes through one of these closed sphincter  muscles, it sounds exactly like a fart, only it's inside. 
[05:26:30]  Right.  And sometimes it could sound exactly like a fart.  But...  Like muffled from the sheets or something.  But no one's going to be bothered by it.  Right.  Because it just stinks inside you.  Oh, my God.  The fart was inside me.  That was amazing.  That was amazing.  And when they were looking at me, I was like, you guys...  I was with this guy once, and all of a sudden, I thought I had a fart, and I was inside fart,  and I almost came out.  And then I did fart, and it came out as a smoke ring.  And everyone laughed and laughed, and I didn't know I could blow smoke rings.  I fired in the last cigarette I had. 
[05:27:00]  It was like 15 minutes ago, and I still had a smoke.  And it was great.  Dirk and the gang are loving the new impression, the new Anthony impression.  Paul, who knew you could do Tara, Anthony?  Who knew?  Who knew?  Horrible whore.  All right.  Want to take a break?  All righty.  All right.  Before we go to break, we have Tara Reid calling back.  Yes, Tara.  Hey, guys. 
[05:27:30]  How you doing?  I just want to say hi to my friend Ray Romano.  Ray, are you there?  Yeah.  Come on.  Oh, my God.  You sound so crazy.  Remember the night of the night we went out to the club, and I had a club in my hand,  and we were doing a club thing?  No.  Sometimes when I eat too much food, Ray Romano goes crazy as not to say.  I don't know what to do either.  Right, Ray?  Oh, what are you doing?  Stop talking about that.  Oh, God.  I don't want to tell you, Ray.  Crazy guy.  Oh, wow.  And he pushed out. 
[05:28:00]  Very good.  You could now go down to the UCB and just be a star.  A little improv like that.  Yeah, I know.  Do a little Ray Romano.  That's the most amazing thing ever.  Get into there a little click.  You won't just be a stand-up anymore.  I can have as much ability to do Ray as Tara has knowledge of Europe.  Potatoes and Greek mythology.  Potatoes and Greek mythology.  She mixed up the potato famine with Greek mythology.  Fantastic.  Maybe those people are so poor, some of the people who do that, they're so poor, they've never touched anything in their lives. 
[05:28:30]  Let them touch those things for one.  All together now.  Let them touch those things.  Let them touch those things.  Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't take things for one. 
[05:29:00]  Take a kayak.  I'm a kayak.  What up?  What the?  Yeah.  What the?  What the?  Yeah.  Yeah!  Fun.  Take, take, take a kayak.  Take, take, take, take, let them touch those things. 
[05:29:30]  Let them, them touch, touch, touch, touch, touch, touch, touch those, those, those things.  Please don't think it is for once.  Take a chair, take a chair.  What's up?  What's up, what's up?

This is Nathaniel, by the way.  I got absolutely no help from either Danny or Travis, because they're pieces of shit.  It's bombs and flubs.  You can figure out what it's about.  Because like E-Rock says, it's self-explanatory.  Brand new bit on the radio show.  Thanks to Nathaniel and maybe some of the other guys.  I'm not really sure. 
[05:32:30]  Who should get credit for this?  No, no, they're shaking their heads.  Uh-oh.  Well, Nathaniel?  They don't want credit for this.  They don't want any credit.  Here's Than.  It's a new bit called Bombs and Flubs.  Bombs and Flubs.  Yes, people bombing on the show.  Yeah.  And people flubbing on the show.  Flubbing their words.  And just bombing with jokes.  And what pisses me off under the flub section, it's all me and Jimmy. 
[05:33:00]  Because Anthony talks perfectly.  No, I've had my share, that's for sure.  Well, they couldn't find one, Anthony.  It's just what I happened to record.  They couldn't find one example of you flubbing a line.  Or flubbing a word.  How about pundit?  I know.  I know, that's a perfect one.  That was a good one.  That'll be in volume two.  Yeah, this is the start of a new bit.  Which isn't all that far off.  Pundit.  Pundit.  Yeah, I must have heard that wrong years ago and it just stuck.  I noticed there's a lot of examples from last week's show. 
[05:33:30]  Did you?  Well, I did notice there was a mandate put out about wanting more of this sort of thing.  But yes, it's a lot from last week.  You know you've been doing this show for nine months, right?  That's what I heard.  And you got a week.  You know how I know that?  Well, it's a new bit.  So it'll grow from here.  Yeah.  We'd like to see the beginning of some of these bits and then they take on a life of their own.  Right.  But here's Nathaniel's bombs and flubs.  Here's the first bomb from Anthony.  Oh.  This was a rape joke that went horribly wrong, I believe. 
[05:34:00]  If you could believe it.  He was talking to Paul's wife.  Paul's wife, okay.  You know, the couple that came in last week and gave us great radio?  Uh-huh.  All right, here we go.  Police arrested seven men who allegedly kidnapped and gang raped a married woman in retaliation  for her cousin's affair with one of the suspect's daughters.  What a deal.  Wow.  Yeah.  One suspect was angered over a relationship between his 17-year-old daughter and the victim's  20-year-old cousin, so him and his friends got together and fucked their mom. 
[05:34:30]  Okay.  I hear she blew the whole thing, though.  Yeah.  And actually accepting it and just going through with it.  It's not rape, it's okay.  It ruined it for them because they wanted to rape her and she just, you know, agreed with  it and, yeah, where am I going?  It was fun just watching you meander down that dead end.  Out of my peripheral vision, I just see Jimmy's teeth, so I know he's smiling.  I'm like, I'm just dumb.  I got it.  How much longer am I going to keep this fucking... 
[05:35:00]  Scotty, what's up?  One wheel left on that car.  Oh, I was working the controls.  I was trying to keep that joke airborne.  I have no elevator control whatsoever.  Nothing.  I went in flames.  Oh, this is great.  Oh, did that hurt.  Bombs and flubs.  The next bomb is from our own Ben.  Ben.  Good old Ben made the bombs and flubs.  I bombed.  Jim, were you upset that Ozzy didn't play Live 8?  Yep.  Hold on, sir.  What?  Are you upset that Ozzy didn't play Live 8? 
[05:35:30]  No, I heard it.  I just wanted to bomb twice.  He did it again.  Oh, by the way, because Jimmy smiled.  He goes, what?  Like, just waiting for him to do it again so he could turn it around.  Oh, he wound right up and threw it again.  Wow, that is really funny.  These are funny.  Oh, and you take them completely out of context here and throw them in.  God damn, this is going to be a great new bit on the show, Nathaniel.  Yeah, good job, Booth, not taking any credit for this. 
[05:36:00]  Yeah.  Smart move.  All right, the next bomb is from Colin.  Good old Colin Quinn.  Colin's like when Frank used to show up on Carson.  Yeah.  You know, he'd just pop in, sit on the couch, talk a little, and then you think he's going  to just slide over?  Yeah.  And let, like, George Goble sit down and have an interview?  No, he's getting up, he's leaving.  He's too busy.  Norton's like Frank, too.  Frank Gorshin, that is.  Dead.  That's exactly what you should leave home. 
[05:36:30]  Wow, these are real bombs.  Think he's that fucking old man.  That's the first Frank reference he can yank out.  Guy's been on TV since 1968.  This is like a blooper show.  Or a blooper reel.  The gag reel.  I like it.  All right.  Here's my favorite part of Cannonball Run when they just show the floor.  Oh, at the end, when they're supposed to say one thing, but Dom DeLuise is blowing  a guy who's bringing him his food in the room.  You're not supposed to say that. 
[05:37:00]  Your line isn't, you're so young.  And Burt Reynolds goes to tip his cap and it's his wig and some skin comes up.  Good day to you.  Ow.  Gets mad and punches the craft services girl right in the face.  All right, here we go with old Jimmy Norton's bomb.  This couldn't be a bomb.  You had a Y2K joke, did you?  Huh?  I bet you there were big laughs and they took him out.  Probably.  You had a Y2K joke, did you? 
[05:37:30]  One of the problems that they were saying was going to happen was that the computer system  was going to backdate 100 years.  Yeah.  Because the old one flip, they would have went back to 1901.  1900.  And I said, that's going to be great.  It's going to help me in my big court case.  What are they going to do?  Prosecute me for having sex with a girl who's 114?  Yeah.  I want more.  No.  No.  No.  Oh, good one.  That was a good one.  Wouldn't that make her younger?  Well, it didn't make perfect mathematical sense.  Yeah.  That would have happened. 
[05:38:00]  Like right when I got that, it's like if she was 14 in the year 2000, let's say, if it  was then 1900, she's not even born yet.  Well, let's be happy that you weren't in the audience.  Three years I was doing it beforehand.  You've never talked about Y2K since, you know, 1971.  Yes, they were.  Wow.  Glad I brought that up.  How will it affect your Pong game?  We'll tell you.  Let's, uh...  71?  No.  Double bomb.  Nice.  I was a...  I piggybacked onto your bomb bit.  My...  I was going down in flames and you decided just to get in the cockpit with me. 
[05:38:30]  I was jumping in.  Hey, it looks toasty in there.  I'm a little hurt, by the way.  Anthony has one bomb and zero flubs.  I kind of have two bombs, though.  I was a bomb in that one.  Yeah.  My Pong joke didn't go over very well.  I didn't want to...  It was overshadowed by Jimmy's bomb a little bit, but...  Here's, uh...  Bombs and flubs.  Another bomb.  Oh, Jimmy Norton again.  All right, we get it.  He's chugling along.  Did you get that instant feedback?  Play Keep on Chugling. 
[05:39:00]  It was from John F. at Yahoo.com.  It's John Fogarty.  Of course.  I got it.  It didn't help that I got it.  Oh, no, I suck.  You know, when you're live on the air like this, you throw them out and just hope they  connect, and sometimes they just don't, Jimmy.  We all understand. 
[05:39:30]  We got to do another one.  Nervous listeners is another one, maybe.  Oh, yeah.  Another one that go-getters could take up.  Who wants to run with that one in that office, huh?  Travis?  I've already started to list myself.  Maybe I can hand it off to one of the other guys.  Oh, wait.  Delegating responsibility now.  Look at him.  One of my inferiors, maybe.  You have middle management written all over you.  Sweet.  All right.  It's bombs and flubs.  Well, we could just go to the next one. 
[05:40:00]  We'll skip this.  What?  Why is that?  What?  There's no skipping.  What?  There's no skipping Nathaniel's hard work.  What happened?  I'd rather not skip it.  I want to hear it.  How did you know it was the game who just circled St. Vincent's?  Just circled the Statue of Liberty and pointed at the Statue of Liberty and said, that's  a woman?  No. 
[05:40:30]  Well, she's gloved, gloved.  That was a boat crash.  I should have just enjoyed your great line.  It was taking too long to get to.  You were going, well, you're circling it, and I saw you going, oh, shit.  Well, you kind of threw me off.  I had a really good line, and then you killed with that line, and then I'm like, why am I  doing this?  In the middle of it, I'm like, why am I even doing this now?  Why?  Comedy is all about timing.  I'm like, I knew as soon as I started.  I'm like, why am I doing this?  Why?  Wow.  That is so funny, having to explain it and being there all red-faced. 
[05:41:00]  Oh, it's the worst.  Oh.  Just circling the Statue of Liberty.  Whenever you pluralize something, you have to make it singular.  I'm over.  I'm over.  I'm over.  Wow.  That was rough.  Yeah.  That was very uncomfortable.  We've all been there.  We've all been there.  Here's another bomb from British Paul.  Is that his name on the show now?  British Paul?  I don't know.  Yeah.  Roll that.  No, they just felt like there was nothing moving them around.  Like dead weight?  Yeah.  Was it like holding arms, those thin, muscler-less calves? 
[05:41:30]  Two white shoes on.  Fucking nurse shoes.  Useless shoes.  Never.  The soles never get dirty.  Pristine sneakers.  Still have that, like, news sticker on the bottom.  They're transically clean.  It's like I was imagining that scene from I'm Gonna Get You Sucker, where to go and put  some legs up on the nightstand.  But they were real.  Fuck. 
[05:42:00]  You didn't know.  I could hope he just fucked me up.  Yeah, he's describing sex with a lady that's paralyzed from the waist down there.  All right, we got another bomb from British Paul.  Finishing up the bomb section of the bombs and flubs bit.  So how did you, did you kind of think like, hmm, this is perplexing because if she's numb  down there, what the hell am I supposed to do?  If she says that's a huge fucking dick, when it's in there, I'll be like, hmm, wonder  if she's lying.  You know? 
[05:42:30]  She's definitely lying.  Oh, I love when they bomb.  Very good.  How did Kev not get any bombs?  Wow.  What did you?  Go back a week.  You just went a week, didn't you?  Well, because we just kind of came up with this thing.  We're going to have to really go through the history of the time we've been here.  Drudge up some of those old bombs.  Because this is a great new bit.  It really is.  I like it. 
[05:43:00]  There's some, the flubs go back a little farther.  All right.  All right.  Now here's some flubs, Anthony, from the show.  Here's old Jimmy Norton.  Jimmy?  The flubs are all Jimmy and I.  That's it.  Really?  No, Anthony.  I know.  And no one else from the show.  Ant does weigh in on one and flub in the process.  Oh, goody.  Oh, can we guess which one here?  No, I'm just, leave it teased.  Flubs.  Eric Logan sent out an ass email about these tapes and he said that she's having a tough 
[05:43:30]  time at the breakup.  That might have been better if I didn't say he sent out an ass email.  Ass email.  Yeah, you did say that.  An ass email.  Yeah.  I remember that one.  That's technically everyone that Logan sends out.  Ah, look.  You're recouped.  Right here.  Yeah, a month later.  All right, here's another one from Jimmy.  That's great.  Yeah, Detroit Autowalker.  Oh.  I had Ivan Demjeniuk was the name I was, I remember. 
[05:44:00]  Right, right.  There you go.  Of course, but I couldn't get Detroit Autowalker.  And a Detroit Autowalker named Ivan Demjeniuk.  No.  Oh, did you see that jerk?  Oh, did you see that jerk?  Yeah.  Oh, looker.  Yeah.  Here's myself flubbing away.  The bleeps aren't cursed, are they?  No.  I mean, the bleeps aren't cursed. 
[05:44:30]  Yes, they are.  Stay away from the bleeps.  They are cursed.  They've been damned.  We got a little mixed up there.  Happens every day, actually.  Here's Jimmy.  As you're blowing out your 80th birthday cake candles, a couple of large men come in with  gloves and push your face into it until your feet stop moving.  What are gloves?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Sounds that Connor and Lacey make. 
[05:45:00]  Oh, my God.  Hey, flub, but came back strong.  Wow, you certainly did, Jimmy.  You came back strong.  It's been a great joke until you're blowing out your 80th birthday candles and men push  your face into the cake until you die.  I don't know what I was talking about, but I'm really proud of myself.  Wish I could have got that one out.  Yeah.  Good one.  Conceptually a gem.  Back to me.  If you want to see the epitome of an absolutely...  Epitome.  Oh, epitome.  Sorry.  Epitome.  Jesus Christ.  Oh, my Lord. 
[05:45:30]  Epitome.  Yeah, I remember that one.  All right.  Well, Anthony's perfect, so we go back to Jimmy.  No, I know I got plenty.  We were just kidding when we simulated the home invasion.  We didn't really rape his rife wife.  Ah, fuck.  Rape his rife?  We didn't rape his rife.  We didn't rape his rife.  I'd bribe him, boss.  I'd bribe him, boss.  You actually just said it right.  I know.  I stink.  You're stinking.  What, are we in Taiwan?  What the hell?  God.  Wait, there's rife. 
[05:46:00]  I don't know.  I was so eager to spit that one out.  Yes, you are.  My little rotten, thin lips wouldn't open fast enough.  You were stumbling through that line right from the beginning.  You could hear him like you were constantly trying to catch up with your tongue.  Back to me.  Does Flavor Flay and VH1 and everyone realize that we're off the air in like 15 minutes?  You do know it's Flavor Flav.  Yeah, not me.  He's running a little late.  He should be here soon.  Oh, but do you absolutely know it's Flavor Flav?  Yeah.  With a V?  Yeah, but that's how they say it in the ghetto. 
[05:46:30]  Flavor Flay.  Do they say Flavor Flay?  Yeah, they get lazy at the end of words sometimes.  No, it's actually Flavor Flavor.  That's why Flavor Flav is the cuddle.  Flavor Flavor?  But you could just say Flavor Flay.  Fuh.  I don't know.  That's been nitpicking a bit.  A little bit.  Back to Jimmy.  Did the soup actually fall into the soup or did the part where your mouth goes just commit  suicide and jump?  I think it was where my mouth goes.  Did the soup actually fall into the soup?  Wait, did I say that?  Oh, my God.  Did I say the soup? 
[05:47:00]  You just said, did the soup actually fall into the soup?  Well, that's a legitimate question because sometimes soup will get mixed up, and I hate  when another man's soup falls into my soup.  Did your phone fall into your phone?  Wow.  You just don't even know that you did that.  No.  I just love Anthony, just the disappointment in his voice right after someone flubs.  Well, I enjoy Jimmy so much that I want to hear what he's saying. 
[05:47:30]  And when he fucks it up, it's taking away entertainment from me.  That's right.  He's stealing from me.  But you also get a little joy out of it.  I get a lot of joy out of it.  You said epitome.  You can't get past that.  Well, look how it's spelt.  It's spelt epitome.  I don't want to do this bit anymore.  This bit stinks.  And I'm thinking, you know, I've got some outdoor space in Manhattan. 
[05:48:00]  Maybe I'll have an alpaca running around.  Yeah, they have a lifespan of 15 to 20 years.  So, you know, the kid won't be heartbroken right away like a goldfish or something.  And they look like llamas?  Llamas?  Llamas.  They look like...  Jesus.  A black llama?  I corrected myself really fast.  A boss would have said, why?  Jesus.  A black llama.  That's good.  Hey, the llama.  The llama. 
[05:48:30]  Oh, this is painful.  Back to Jimmy.  Because Anthony's perfect.  Yeah.  And a bigger rival in Cronkite.  Cronkite.  Oh.  Oh, at least you didn't say Cronkite.  Cronkite gave a sexier proclamation of JMK's death.  That's what I was calling.  Took his glasses off.  That was hot.  Yeah.  Cronkite.  Cronkite. 
[05:49:00]  Oh, you horrible.  He's disgusted with himself.  Cronkite.  That's a good one.  All right.  It's kind of like the Cronkite Watergate scandal.  Oh.  Mark that one, fan.  Asterisk.  Asterisk.  In case you need a little reference.  That's a flom.  I bet you've bombed a flub.  Here's another one. 
[05:49:30]  One day I'll change it and just say I grabbed Richard by the hair and said, suck my cock,  bitch.  Suck my cock.  Cop?  Jesus.  Forget it.  In a bit.  Suck my cock.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Can you put a siren on that car?  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Oh, dear Lord.  And finally, the last bomb and flub for today.  Who is it?  It's not you.  Give me an H.  Give me a Y. 
[05:50:00]  Give me an S.  Give me a T.  Give me an R.  What's his spell?  The beginning of hysterectomy.  Hysterectomy?  Hysterectomy.  Is it H-E?  No, H-Y.  H-Y.  S-T-E-R.  You said R.  S-T-E-R.  Yeah, you said S-T-R.  You sure?  I'm positive.  Play the tape back.  I'm pretty sure I said E-R.  No, you fucked up.  I certainly didn't.  Hysterectomy.  I'm sorry.  You'll have to get a hysterectomy.  Did you hear the way I bailed out of this? 
[05:50:30]  I didn't feel like spelling out the entire word?  Of course.  Especially after leaving out a letter.  A hysterectomy.  That's not bad at all.  Little comma in there.  Just take that letter out.  Let's say hi to Andy in New Jersey.  Sound friendly.  Andy.  Yo, what's up?  Hey, listen.  Anthony does mess up, man.  Every time he says finger, younger.  Finger, younger.  Stop it.  Finger.  It's good that you picked those two words to put together, too.  Fuck it out. 
[05:51:00]  Younger.  Finger.  Younger.  Younger.  Nathaniel, bravo.  Good job.  Thank you.  Yes.  The first installment of Bombs and Flubs.  How come there's no enthusiastic applause coming from the booth?  It's weird.  Yeah, what?  Anyone want to take any credit now?  For a little help?  No?  Oh, they're being honest.  It's cute.  They're a little jealous.  I think so.  There you go.  All right.  All yearning.  Like puppies in a basket.  You take one out and pet it.  They all look like, why aren't you petting me?  That's right.  Silence of the Lambs musical. 
[05:51:30]  There's really nothing more to say about this than it's just absolutely brilliant.  To take Silence of the Lambs and write a fucking parody song to it is just amazing in itself.  So behold the majesty.  Silence of the musical.  Thanks for holding one finger over your ear like you're fucking recording We Are the World.  Because it's going to fall off my head like that.  I don't want to musk my jelly hair.  Breaking news.  Hey, who's this?  This is John and Al. 
[05:52:00]  John and Al?  Yeah, we're both here.  Hi, guys.  You guys are calling from California?  Yep.  So it's like 6.40.  Sorry to wake you.  Whatever you guys are doing there, man.  But this Silence of the Lambs, the musical, is freaking hilarious.  You've got to tell us a little bit about it.  All right.  But we wrote it about it.  Yeah, I can recognize the voice.  Yeah, you did Buffalo Bill, didn't you?  You did Buffalo Bill.  Hey, just a little Buffalo Bill.  Will you have me?  God, I feel like I'm talking to a big-time celebrity now.  That's right.  Dude, we're all humming your songs. 
[05:52:30]  In the crook.  How about was she a great big fat person?  Was she a great big fat person?  Very cool.  So why did you guys decide to make this?  Well, obviously, I mean, it's a hit, but...  We just did it for fun, to tell you the truth.  Yeah, we know that.  Basically, we saw that there was a song in Singing in the Rain called Would You,  and that's one of our favorite Buffalo Bill lines.  Would you?  Like, for years, we'd always say, would you?  Like, if it's the idea. 
[05:53:00]  So we had, like, an idea for, like, five or six songs within a minute,  and then we just did it.  What kind of musical background you got?  We have composition degrees from USC.  Really?  Yeah.  That's nice.  Where'd you get the...  You made all the music and everything?  Yeah, we did it all in our apartment.  All in your apartment?  Just you guys, or did you have, like, orchestras?  No.  It sounds really good.  It's all us, and we had a woman sing on the chorus, but that's it.  It's great.  It's really great.  We can't get enough of this thing.  Are you selling this, or...  Until they shut you down? 
[05:53:30]  We had it online, like, for, like, a year and a half for free,  and, like, lost a lot of money with people just downloading it,  but that's basically what we wanted.  Yeah.  And now we sell it just to try and make some of the money back.  Basically, we're breaking even, because we still have it online,  and it costs, like, 80 bucks a month.  Where can they get the, uh...  Where can they get it online?  Uh, silencethemusical.com.  Was it one of your favorite movies?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  What's your favorite song off this thing? 
[05:54:00]  That's a good one.  Uh, the lotion song.  Yeah, obviously.  Yeah, that's the hit, man.  That one is just too goddamn funny.  That's your Welcome to the Jungle.  Fantastic.  We also like Are You About a Size 14?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's a good one, too, sure.  And, uh, well, If I Could Smell Her Sea is pretty good.  We played that one, because we're on satellite radio.  Any other movies that you thought about doing that?  Uh, RoboCop.  That would be funny.  And Spartacus, but we shall see.  Cool. 
[05:54:30]  Yeah.  Very good.  Yeah, we just want to say hi to you guys,  because we've been having a lot of fun with this song the last week or so.  And, man, we're going to link you guys to our website, so.  Would you?  Fuck me hard.  Hey, what was that song,  I'm Crying Over You, Crying...  You know the song in the background that he's tucking his dick between his legs and dancing to?  Oh, yeah, the real song in the movie.  I'm Crying Over You.  Yeah, it's really a hot number.  I don't know what the name of that song is.  A hot number?  Yeah.  Over you. 
[05:55:00]  Dirty mechanic fingernails tweaking his own nipples.  Fuck me hard.  I love it.  Great job, guys.  It's silencethemusical.com.  What?  Yeah, these guys are half asleep.  I mean, let's be honest here.  Your website is silencethemusical.com.  People can purchase this.  Maybe a few of our listeners should purchase it, please.  I know our fans are, you know, internet savvy,  but someone throw some money at these guys.  I'll just tape it off the fucking radio. 
[05:55:30]  Fuck these guys.  I hope that they go for all of us.  Put the fucking money in the PayPal.  All right, if you guys got anything else you want us to play on the radio,  just contact Steve, okay?  Okay, thanks a lot.  You guys rock.  Thanks, guys.  There they go, John and Al.  Very funny.  Very funny.  A couple of artistes.  A couple of artistes.  They're just hanging out there in California.  How long ago did they do that? 
[05:56:00]  It's like what?  About a year and a half ago.  About a year and a half ago?  Are they still in school?  No, they're both, they're working at some place that has to do with film composition.  What are they together so early in the morning for?  They're brothers.  Doing goofball musicals.  Oh, they're brothers.  They're brothers.  Okay, I was thinking maybe there was a lava thing going on there.  He's my lava.  Put your fucking dick in my asshole.  Put your fucking cock in my funky treasure.  I think it's two chimps on a Davenport and a bass.

It's the best bits of Opie and Anthony since coming to XM Satellite Radio, and one of our favorite in-studio guests was Howie Mandel. 
[06:00:30]  Howie's a germaphobe, and he explains to us a time when he was potty training his daughter, and it went all wrong.  This is ONA's best bits.  I'll tell you, I've had, like, horrible potty training stories.  I had one where my daughter, my daughter, my first daughter, my daughter's, like, 21 now, but when she was young, I guess, how old are you when you're potty training?  You're almost two years old?  Depends on the chromosomes.  Right.  But my wife was really into the potty training, you know, and read all the books, and you have to, you know, after she pees or shits in the potty, you know, we all have to applaud, and everybody who's around, it's a big deal. 
[06:01:00]  She's just about potty training.  My wife says, I was going out one day, and she says, you take her, you take her with you.  So I have this baby in the car seat, and she's just a little girl, a little baby, and we're out someplace, and she says to me, Dad, I have to go potty.  And, you know, my heart, I get heart palpitations.  I'm thinking, I can't go in a public restroom.  I can't sit her down.  And where am I going to take her?  I can't go in the men's room.  And I don't want her to sit down. 
[06:01:30]  I mean, I can't go in the ladies' room.  I don't want her to sit down in the men's room.  So I said, honey, you know, can you hold it?  Is there any way to hold it?  And she goes, you know, the baby.  Yeah, yes.  She goes, I'll try, Daddy, because she could see the horror in my eye.  She goes, I'll try, Dad.  So I put her in the car, and I put her in the car seat, and we're driving down the Ventura Freeway.  I live in Los Angeles.  We're driving down the Ventura Freeway.  And she goes, from the back seat, I hear, Daddy, I can't hold it.  I go, okay, honey, we'll pull off here, and we'll go to the gas station. 
[06:02:00]  She goes, no, I can't hold it.  I go, okay, okay, fine.  So we pull over to the side of the Ventura Freeway, this public freeway, and I pull out,  and there's, like, hedges on the side of the freeway there.  So I get her out.  I unbuckle her from the car seat, and I put her in my arm, and I go over to the hedges,  and I take one step over to the hedges, and I don't realize it's a gully.  It's a ravine.  Oh, my God.  So I step, and I slip on my back.  I fall on my back, and I start hurtling down this mountain, down the side of the Ventura Freeway.  And I'm holding the baby.  I'm coddling her on my side. 
[06:02:30]  She's screaming.  I'm yelling.  The twigs are breaking.  There's mud that my pants rip.  It cuts my ass, and I end up at the bottom of this gully in this horrible, like, infested  kind of wet puddle, and I'm bleeding, and I'm in this gully, and I'm holding the baby,  and she's crying, and I kind of stand up, and I hold her in front of me, and she goes,  I got to go.  I got to pee.  I go, okay, all right, and I look.  My wife had put her in some sort of, like, a jumpsuit kind of thing, so I unbuckle the 
[06:03:00]  thing, and I pull it down around her ankles, and I'm holding her up by the armpits in front  of me, and I go, okay, honey, go, go, and she goes, I can't.  I'm going to pee on my pants.  I'm going to pee because her legs are down below, and this is the first daughter.  I've never really, you know, I grew up with brothers and everything.  I said, okay, all right, just put your feet up on my shoulders, up on my neck.  I'm holding her in front of me, like, face-to-face.  Put your feet up on my neck, and then I figure, you know, your legs are out toward me, and  then you'll pee down into this.  If a cop saw this, you'd be shot, by the way.  Right, so her feet are up on my neck, and I go, okay, go. 
[06:03:30]  Well, I didn't know that.  It seems like, with the vagina, that whatever way your feet are aiming is what way the fluid  goes.  So she goes, and then all of a sudden, it's in my face.  She's pissing in my face, my fucking mouth, in my mouth.  I'm screaming like a woman.  Like, my ass is bleeding.  I'm standing in a puddle of, this is for a guy who didn't want to go into a public bathroom.  And I start to scream, and she's screaming, and it's all over her clothes. 
[06:04:00]  And she goes, I got it on my clothes.  Her fucking clothes, it's in my fucking mouth.  So I'm trying to be a good dad, and I take off the bottom of her pants, and now she's  naked, and my hands are covered in the mud and the blood, so now it's all over her, and  I'm filled with piss.  She's filled with piss, and I try to climb the hill.  Now I'm climbing the hill, and it's mud.  You know, and I get up, like, five steps, and then I slide back down the hill, and she's  crying, and I'm almost crying, and I can't breathe.  And, you know, my heart, I think I'm going to have a heart attack.  Like, finally, after it seems like an eternity, I get up on top, on the freeway, and I come 
[06:04:30]  through the hedges, like 500 feet from where my car is.  And I'm standing there, and I'm bleeding, and I'm covered in mud, and she's crying, and  there's piss, and there's blood, and a car slows down, and I got a naked little girl out  of the hedges, and the car slows down, and pulls down his window and goes, are you Howie  Mandel?  And I said, no, get the fuck out of here.  No.  And we get into the car.  My wife is waiting.  My wife has never let me take the, I don't really take the kids out anymore. 
[06:05:00]  No, I wouldn't let you either.  No.  That's such a good one.  What a horrific story.  Oh, I hate when that happens.  Oh, yeah.  Fuck.  Be and Anthony's Best Bits.  Be and Anthony's Best Bits.  Favorite show intro.  Hey, we don't all sound that dumb.  Number three.  Most people come to St. Patrick's Cathedral to pray.  One couple allegedly came to the New York City landmark to have sex, sex, sex.  Good morning. 
[06:05:30]  Based on a dare from radio hosts here in New York.  Hello.  They fired these two guys for orchestrating an obscene stunt in New York's most famous Catholic  category.  Shock Jocks Opie and Anthony had encouraged a couple to have sex at locations where a producer  was waiting to call in the play-by-play.  Opie and Anthony were fired, and their nationally syndicated show canceled.  Did these Shock Jocks simply go too far?  When they crossed the line.  And this is outrageous.  Oh, dear.  What are you, stupid?  Huh?  Just when everything was going good.  Greg Opie Hughes. 
[06:06:00]  I like yam bags on the toes.  And Anthony, tell me, I'm hoping for a big, fiery rear-ender.  Broadcast an outrageous live account of a couple allegedly having sex right in New York's  St. Patrick's Cathedral on a holy day of obligation.  Presided over the slaughter of a wild pig.  Closed down San Francisco's Bay Bridge.  Encourged teenage girls to run naked.  And invited listeners to compare the taste of eggnog and urine.  They're screwing everything up.  Shock Jocks.  Not only does it involve obscenity in the most extreme form, the nerve of these people to 
[06:06:30]  actually have it as a setup.  No crap, Sherlock.  Die.  Die.  Die.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Some of you new listeners might not have met Dee Dee yet.  She's one of our favorite friends of the show.  She's a fellow Exum employee who works out of the D.C. office, and she has a very funny  voice.  In fact, she sounds like a small child.  On top of that, she has a horrific accent.  This is when Opie and Anthony and Jim make fun of that accent on O&A's Best Bits.  All right, Dee Dee, you want to do some more news? 
[06:07:00]  Maybe real news this time?  Hey!  I had, like, a Rob Lowe story, and I did good before, right?  You tricked us with a Rob Lowe.  I know.  Well, you...  All right, how about Stanton Island Animal Shelter?  What?  Animal Shelter?  It's about an animal shelter.  Wait, where are you?  Stanton Island.  Wait, what the hell is that?  What?  Nothing.  Sorry.  I don't know.  What the...  Somebody hit a button.  Okay, there you go.  I'm sorry.  Go ahead, Dee Dee.  Okay, Stanton Island.  An animal shelter begins spilling kittens. 
[06:07:30]  What?  Okay, we see...  What?  All right, um...  Hold on, I was just laughing, because they're making faces in the other room.  I'm sorry.  All right.  Okay, can you start again?  You asses, stop with that.  Okay, go ahead, Dee.  I'm sorry, Dee Dee.  Go ahead.  Yeah, just start over.  We're all looking in here.  All right.  Anyway.  Dee Dee with the news, everybody.  Go ahead, Dee Dee.  The last few months, a Stanton Island animal shelter has been trying to find homes for  all the kittens that come in there.  Why are you laughing? 
[06:08:00]  No reason.  You make Steve sound like boss.  Well, Steve is jumping up and down, making goopy faces.  I'm sorry.  He's trying to distract the show, so...  Nothing.  I didn't hear...  First of all, they're all laughing.  I didn't hear where this took place or what was happening.  All right, I'm sorry.  What's the story?  It came up, Brooklyn, something about animals.  Yes.  Where was it?  Steve, stop, okay?  I was told to stay at Stanton Island.  Okay.  All right.  And you're right.  You have the news story.  I don't.  All right.  I didn't even hear that because I was telling Steve to stop.  All right.  So why don't we start again here? 
[06:08:30]  Why don't we make believe nothing happened yet?  Okay.  Here we go.  Let's do it with the news.  Okay.  All right.  Stanton Island.  Animal shelter.  Why is that so funny?  Good.  What do you think?  Nothing.  I know.  Anyway, there's animal shelter that's killing kittens.  Because I live on Long Island.  All right.  Is that where that was?  No, so long, Alan.  No, Alan.  Dude.  Where was it?  I'm not going to say.  Anyway, the last few months, this animal shelter has been trying to find homes for all the  kittens that come in there.  It's not funny. 
[06:09:00]  And because they can't find homes, many cute kittens are going to be turned into General  South's chicken.  Why are you laughing?  And why are they going to be turned into General...  Because they're at full capacity, so they have to do it.  So come on, people.  Go get a kitten.  Don't let them die.  A kitten.  A kitten.  I can't even...  Listen.  They're going to kill them because they're at full capacity.  They only kill kittens when...  He's mocking me. 
[06:09:30]  I'm not mocking you.  You're not.  You said kittens.  That's kittens.  That's the way you say it whenever there's a hard T sound.  Do you prefer Brooklyn or Manhattan?  Brooklyn.  Have you ever been in Manhattan?  Nope.  Okay.  You're trying to get me to say Manhattan.  Manhattan.  Damn it.  Do you like Manhattan or Australia?  Australia.  Because they have an accent.  Do you like wearing the gloves with all the fingers or those other things where it's  just the thumb? 
[06:10:00]  Yeah.  What do they call that?  I forgot.  What's the word, D.D.?  It comes with your thumb and then the other four fingers.  You know, you wear them in the winter.  Gloves?  No.  Not gloves.  Mittens!  All right.  Any more?  Mittens!  Mittens!  For kittens.  Yes.  In Staten Island.  Staten Island and mittens.  You have to...  There's a...  It's just a very hard T sound, which we like.  It actually...  You pronounce it properly.  It just sounds weird.  It's because I'm from the Midwest, Chicago.  No, I know you're from Chicago.  That's why they say kittens. 
[06:10:30]  Kittens.  Kittens.  Smite me.  Kittens.  Kittens.  Manhattan.  Manhattan.  Kuttering.  Kuttering.  Oh!  Kuttering.  Okay, so yeah.  So go get a kitten so they don't die.  All right.  Get a kitten.  Yes.  If you know what that is, go get one.  It's a cat.  A little cat.  Okay.  All right.  So for the ten people listening to us in Staten Island, they're all going to go now.  No, there's no.  Staten Island.  Staten Island.  Staten Island.  Okay.  See how to say it, Jimmy.  Staten Island.  Staten Island. 
[06:11:00]  Staten Island.  Staten Island.  Staten Island.  Yeah, Staten Island.  Staten Island.  Yeah.  My tongue goes the other way.  Staten.  It's like whenever there's a T like there, like Manhattan or Staten, you usually say Manhattan  or Staten Island.  Staten Island.  Or kitten.  Kitten.  Instead of kitten.  Kitten.  No one says Staten Island.  Or kitten.  Manhattan is awful, too.  I guess I got it from Jelliet, Illinois.  How do you say Jim Norton?  Jim Norton.  Okay, see, that's right. 
[06:11:30]  You have like the N sound in Norton.  You don't hard the T. Jim Norton.  I didn't even realize the word ten was in the word kitten until just now.  Kit ten.  Kit ten.  We got ten.  That ten.  All right.  I can't help it.  Sorry.  Oh, it's all right.  It's okay, Dee Dee.  You're adorable.  Let's go.  Okay.  Did you get the story about the 86-year-old woman in Charlotte, North Carolina?  No.  Why didn't you tell me?  She was jailed after police said she called emergency dispatchers 20 times in a little  more than a half hour, all to complain that a pizza parlor wouldn't deliver. 
[06:12:00]  This old relic called 911 20 times.  When the cops came to arrest her, she fought and bit and scratched them?  Yes.  She's like 90 pounds?  Yes.  We're trying to get the audio.  How old is she?  86.  Oh, my gosh.  She's just nuts, though.  Someone like that is just a bonafide nut.  She's crazy, yeah.  She's an old lady.  She's nuts.  She, when the police officers arrived at her apartment, the five-foot-tall, 98-pound  woman attacked the officer, scratching him, kicking him, and bit his hand. 
[06:12:30]  Wow.  Oh, you know, a chopper's probably popped out on his hand, all drooly.  Ugh.  His hand still smells.  Ugh.  Her plaque.  Like baby powder and efferent.  Old lady mouth.  It should smell like fist.  The cop should have put on a glove and just caved her teeth in with his fist.  All 90 pounds of her.  That's a cute little story.  That is a cute little story.  I would love to hear those 911 calls. 
[06:13:00]  She's not as bad, though, as the younger people that do, because you're 86.  You're obviously a nut.  She's insane.  She's a nut, yeah.  She's just, I mean, she should just be killed.  The Alzheimer's.  That's what I was just going to say.  It was probably that.  What?  Alzheimer's.  Yeah.  What?  I think she's right, actually.  I think you're right.  And then say, I said it right.  How do you say it?  Say it first, though.  No, say it.  Say it, actually.  Say it.  You might be right.  Alzheimer's.  You're right.  You're actually right.  He's right.  He actually pronounces the Z just because of the Z in the word.  How do you say it?  I'm not going to repeat it.  Why?  You're right. 
[06:13:30]  No, you really are right this time.  Go ahead.  No, no, because you're fucking with me right now.  No, no.  No, not at all.  Alzheimer's.  Alzheimer's.  Yeah.  Fine.  All right.  All right.  Any other stories there?  Me or him?  You.  Oh, okay, yeah.  Whenever there's a Z in a word, I just drop it.  I just remove that Z.  There's no need for it.  All time.  Let's go to the O.  All time.  All time.  Alzheimer's.  Yeah.  Anyway, Nebraska State's Attorney.  It's a news group I go to.  Alt.heimers.  Dot sex.  You ever go to the O. 
[06:14:00]  Look at the animals.  We're listening.  100.  Go to the O.  All time.  Alzheimer's.  And I have another story.  My last story is for Jim.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Okay.  Police in Peoria.  That's where your Pryor's hometown, by the way.  It's near my hometown.  Go ahead, it is.  Peoria.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's Pryor's hometown.  Okay.  Police in Peoria, Illinois, have been struck.  No, Peoria.  Yeah. 
[06:14:30]  You didn't say Peoria.  Peoria.  Peoria.  Peoria.  Peoria.  Peoria.  Whatever.  Yeah, it's an island in Peoria.  Police in Peoria, Illinois, have been struck dumbfounded by the first time.  In Illinois?  Yeah, Illinois.  Okay.  Illinois?  Yeah.  No, you're right.  Who cares about the I?  It's me, as far as she's concerned.  I can't.  I love Ellen.  All right.  Illinois.  Well, anyway, can I finish?  Do you like the elephant in the O.  Elephant.  Elephant.  All right.  All right.  Let's start over.  From the top? 
[06:15:00]  Yeah, because...  Yeah, we don't have to know this.  We have ADD.  Go ahead.  All right.  ADD.  Police in Peoria, Illinois, have been struck dumbfounded by the first prostitution case in  the area, so I thought you'd like this.  Yes.  A 47-year-old Christian school teacher thought her snatch was worth $200.  Yep.  She advertised in an escort ad and was caught by police in her love nest apartment, and  a spokesperson stated that $200 should buy you a hot young cowgirl in a posh hotel. 
[06:15:30]  So I thought you'd like that prostitution story.  I do.  The prior mother, funny pit of trivia, was a prostitute.  That's right.  Yeah.  She was a call girl in Peoria, and his grandmother was a madam.  No.  Peoria?  Yeah, Peoria, Illinois.  Yes.  That's right.  Peoria.  All right.  Matt from Nebraska has a question for DD.  Matt?  Yo.  Hi.  What's up, Matt?  Hi, Matt.  Hey, DD.  I was wondering, are you wearing satin panties or cotton panties?  What type do you wear?  Yeah, do you wear the satin or the...  You can't tell me you say the T. 
[06:16:00]  Or the cotton.  Or cotton.  Do you like cotton or satin?  I wear both.  What do you prefer?  Well, it depends.  Like, if I'm out, you know, on a date.  The satin.  Satin.  Satin.  Satin.  Satin.  Satin.  Okay.  That is really hard to say.  You like satin.  Satin.  And if we're just hanging around, you might use the what?  Cotton.  Cotton.  Cotton and satin?  What a chore to speak.  Cotton. 
[06:16:30]  How do you say satin, Reg?  You say it.  Satin.  Satin.  Yeah, we all have accents.  We know that.  But you just amaze us with yours.  How do you say satin?  Satan.  Satan.  Satan is a devil.  Satan.  Satan.  Satan.  All right.  Okay.  Satin.  Give me an O-C-O-D.  Okay.  Very good.  Well, that's satin.  Proper pronunciation.  The O-B-N-A-N-D-E-S-H-O.  This is a delightful bit, I think.  It's when the boys, as they like to be called, 
[06:17:00]  are talking about how your standards for porn are very low when you're young,  and you'll take just about anything.  And they talk about that.  And then Norton also talks about the gang he's in,  and it has a special name, the Crips.  Let's say hi to Eric in Colorado.  Eric, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Have you seen the new Playboy yet?  With Debbie Gibson?  Yeah.  Yeah, that whole celebrity thing, posing nude, is getting old,  and I'll tell you why.  Yeah, that's getting old, but I'll tell you why. 
[06:17:30]  She's fucking odd.  Yeah, but she doesn't show anything.  She doesn't?  She doesn't show, there's no fever shots.  Do you see snatch?  No, you don't see snatch.  None at all?  No hair?  No, she has this, like, she has, like, this, what was it,  a necklace or a belt?  The one shot, she's holding a hat over it.  The other one, I think it's, like, a belt or something she's covering with.  Yeah, it's some kind of wacky necklace or belt that just happens to cover the area perfectly. 
[06:18:00]  Clever ways to hide it.  I mean, it's a human still.  I tell you what, I was comparing her pictures to those of Tiffany that came out last year.  Her pictures are a lot better.  Remember the big Debbie Gibson-Tiffany fight of the 80s?  Yeah.  And then the joke was, you know, which one's going to end up in Playboy first?  Which one?  And Tiffany...  What's funny is when Tiffany follows, Debbie Gibson says she would never do it.  Oh, really?  She did say that?  They all say they'll never do it.  The trick is you've got to do it when you're hot.  When the people want to see you. 
[06:18:30]  If Tiffany and Debbie Gibson did some kind of a dyke thing in Swank Magazine in 1985, you know, maybe then...  Well, I agree with you, because I was looking at the Debbie Gibson spread, and yeah, she's really hot and stuff, but it just annoys me, because, you know, Playboy gets these has-been singers and actresses, and they get them to pose by saying, look, we'll do very artistic photos, and they'll be more of an art thing than, you know, porno.  Playboy stinks.  I mean, Debbie Gibson, she's not really a has-been. 
[06:19:00]  She's been big on Broadway still.  So what?  So is Nathan Lane.  You want to see him naked?  Playboy blows.  Dude, like I said, a has-been.  Trust me.  She'd rather be selling, you know, hit albums.  I mean, do you really want to see...  You know, every time you hear one of those songs, you're going to spring wood now.  All right.  Thank you, bro.  Later.  He's chatty.  They have this phony sense of, like, legitimacy, because they don't show hardcore.  That's what I mean, and that's what's driving me...  It stinks.  If they're not showing pink, then they're not really posing for any of these magazines. 
[06:19:30]  It's called classy.  But they think that's classy.  It's called being classy.  Hustler is honest about the agenda.  This is what I'm looking at it for.  I want it to look like a gynecological, an exam magazine.  You're right.  Filthy.  You're right.  Playboy fills the gap between people that can have that in their house and the poor sons  of bitches that are pussy whipped by their wives that can't have porno in the house.  But for some reason, they've been able to talk their wives into letting them get Playboy,  because that's not really porno. 
[06:20:00]  There are articles in it, interviews with politicians, things like that.  And then the occasional naked girl without, you know, hubba bubba hanging between her knees.  So, you know, it serves its purpose.  And for first timers, you know, you're a kid, you get your hand on a Playboy, that might  as well be hardcore pornography.  Anthony, not anymore, though.  Not anymore.  Not anymore.  And I mean, you know, you make some good points, but I mean, Jim makes a good point about the  honesty issue, you know?  I mean, she's still showing her whore side.  I mean, who's she kidding? 
[06:20:30]  Yeah.  Not if you ask her.  Keeps that private so no one can see it.  That's what I want to see.  That's the only thing I'm interested in.  They could cut the head off.  I don't need to see the head.  It's given me such freedom.  The reason I did this was, I don't know, it's an outlet, it's just a freeing experience  from, shut up, the paycheck.  That's why she did it.  Yeah, because she, you know, wants her name in the press again.  All these people that do this, they do it for the check and the publicity.  It's just an avenue to get your name back up on top for a little while. 
[06:21:00]  There you go.  And then maybe someone will pay attention to her latest song or maybe give her some kind  of role in a movie.  That's all.  You know, but to act like it's artistic and stuff.  No, you're showing desperation and you're, you know, you want people to start talking  about you again.  Right.  But to sit there, I watched her on all these shows, you know, the shows were, the shows,  the shots were done in an artistic fashion.  Yes, they were.  They're very classy.  Look at this one, you know.  Yes, I'm dressed in orange cloth.  It's saffron. 
[06:21:30]  It's art.  I swear.  So you're right about the honesty issue.  If you're going to do it, you should just do it.  Yeah.  We'll see in the future, I guess, like Christina Aguilera, things like that.  Britney.  You think Britney will spread them for Playboy?  Yeah, without a doubt.  She might even go to Hustler.  I think Britney does it before she, you know, starts the down.  The downward spiral?  The downward spiral.  She's already pretty much the has-been, isn't she?  I don't know about that.  Every day there's a picture in the paper. 
[06:22:00]  Yeah, but as far as do now, that short haircut.  Yeah.  She kind of stinks, yeah.  No, she wore that for a day.  She's such trash.  I love it.  She wigged out.  Yeah, remember?  Yeah, we were talking about that last week.  She wigged out for a day.  But she threw the wig on just so she could go out.  Yeah.  But I'm not saying she's not still huge in the news and stuff, but as far as a singing  career goes, how relevant is she these days?  Well, she threw the Greatest Hits package out.  Greatest Hits, that's pretty much, that's all I had, people. 
[06:22:30]  That's all I had.  Now here's the Greatest Hits of it, and I'm done.  You go Greatest Hits, then you go Live Album.  Or do you go Live Album first and then Greatest Hits?  I think Live first.  Live first usually and then Greatest Hits.  Yeah, because you might need some of the live cuts.  Greatest Hits with that one song, that wrecks the Greatest Hits album always.  The one no one cares about because it's new.  It's always in the last position because even the artist knows.  It's crap and no one wants to hear it.  It's something like, just name some stupid band, like Sticks, Sticks Greatest Hits.  It's like one after another, you know all these songs, and then this last freaking song 
[06:23:00]  they're hoping you're going to like.  Something new that sounds like the old stuff with updated lyrics.  They're talking about like, that's what you want to hear.  A band like Yes puts out a Greatest Hits or something, and they write a new song, and  it's about like the internet.  It sounds just like a song that came out in 1975, but you know, it's about computers and  the new stuff, and the Iraq War.  Yeah.  God, this blows. 
[06:23:30]  Shut up.  Really just awful.  Stop whining.  Let's say hi to Ted.  Hey, Ted.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Good, man.  Jimmy, you're off from Shaw Friday night.  Oh, thank you, Ted.  Thank you for attending.  Hey, I was sitting real close to where Pat from Munak was, and Jimmy introduced him as,  you'll know him.  He's the guy with the safety pin in his sock instead of the tent toe.  Oh, did I say that?  Yeah.  Safety pin in his sock. 
[06:24:00]  Oh, yeah.  That's classic.  He has to pin it over.  Pin it over like the sleeve with the one-armed guy.  That's what it was, yeah.  Oh, that is funny.  All right.  That's very good.  Thank you.  Take care.  Bye.  All right.  George, what's going on?  Not much, man.  Toy Boy does suck.  When I was 13, I was introduced to porn through High Society and Hustlers.  Oh, High Society was great.  I used to like Wii.  Remember Wii?  Are you still stealing it out of a machine?  Yes.  That was great.  That's the porno, man. 
[06:24:30]  Like, High Society, like this guy is talking.  Just skank whores in that one.  You get to see all the pimples.  Yeah, just a mess.  There's no airbrushing.  Big thatch of a patch.  Oh, awful.  Yeah, you're great.  You definitely worth the extra two bucks a month.  Thanks, fella.  Thank you, my friend.  I remember in the hotel that was probably about a half a mile from my house, me and my  buddies used to go, and we had screwdrivers.  We would ride.  They had porn vending machines.  They had Wii and Penthouse.  Porn vending machines?  Yeah, it was like a Holiday Inn or whatever, it was like a little local dive hotel, and 
[06:25:00]  they had porn vending machines.  In Jersey?  Oh, yeah, it was on Route 1 in North Brunswick, and we would go with screwdrivers and jimmy  them and steal the new porn.  Yeah.  And I was such a sex addict, even in like 5th or 6th grade, I couldn't look at it until  I was alone, and I could just kind of like rub myself.  Like, I couldn't look at it with my friends.  You couldn't even look at it?  With my friends, no.  Wow, really?  I never got into looking at a porn with my friends.  I would always have to do it alone.  I had a big stash up in a tree fort, and yeah, friends would come by. 
[06:25:30]  It was like a nightclub, you know?  I'd look, no, you, you, you, okay, come on in.  No, you're not dressed right.  Get out of here.  Velvet rope.  We'd get in the tree fort and just hand out the porno, and you'd look at it.  We had an underground tree fort.  An underground tree fort?  Well, depending on the neighborhood, man.  That's a root fort.  Yeah.  I know, I know.  Well, but it was that same, you know, feel.  So, it was a huge piece of plywood that we would cover with leaves and stuff.  And, wait a minute, you dig a hole?  Yeah, a massive hole.  And you cover with plywood.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then we had, like, candles and stuff down there, and that's where our porn was. 
[06:26:00]  I like the tree fort better, the high ground.  Well, we had those, too.  I mean, we had all sorts of different varieties of the fort.  Yeah.  The underground one was pretty cool, though, because it was, like, honestly, it was, like, eight feet down.  Really?  Yeah, it was huge, man.  And enough room side to side?  Yeah, pretty much, yeah.  I'm trying to remember now.  It was probably six by ten feet, probably.  The work you used to put in as a kid to, like, make things like that. 
[06:26:30]  And that was kind of easier, because all you needed was the big piece of plywood.  But a tree fort was, like, you had to go out to, like, places where they were building houses.  Oh, yeah.  And steal the wood.  And get, like, your dad's saw and hammer and a few nails.  And there you are, engineering a place that goes in a tree.  You needed truss work.  And, you know, you have to get up and put those initial cross beams across the trees.  And they never fell down, you know?  It's like kiddie engineering.  You kind of knew you needed this. 
[06:27:00]  You didn't know where you learned it from or anything.  But you kind of knew how to build this structure that didn't collapse when five guys are up in there.  I remember amazing.  When I was a boy, we were going to make a gang in North Brunswick.  We were such faggots.  Oh.  And we were going to call...  A gang.  I swear to God, we kind of like, so let's make a gang.  We were going to call it the Lords.  Oh, my God.  muscles, like, I think.  1955, Jimmy, when did you grow?  It's atrocious.  Baba-ba-ba-ba-ba-bang-dang-dang-dang-dang-dang-dang-dang-dang-dang-dang-dang.  Hey, I'm Jimmy Robinson, eh? 
[06:27:30]  Hey, the Lord.  Cotsie, over here.  Get under the porch, eh?  Hey.  Uh, monster raina-hovela-hovela-ohvela.  But, no, they were going to build a fort.  And me and my friend, like, were so lazy,  we said that we volunteered to go to the hardware store and get the letters.  We were going to write our gang name.  Oh, my God.  You're kidding me.  On the front of the little hangout place.  And that was what me and him did.  Went and picked out letters.  Letters.  F-A-G-G-O-T-S.  Oh, please, yeah. 
[06:28:00]  We had, like, instead of a door, just a big piece of orange cloth that we could walk through.  Just fruits.  The lords.  You're a jet all the way from your coast to your last dying day.  We're the lords.  When you're a jet, let them do what they can.  You've got brothers around.  You're a family man.  You're never alone.  You're never disconnected.  Ha, ha.  You're home with your own.  The company's expected.  You're well protected.  Here come the lords. 
[06:28:30]  And you'll sit with the capital day, which you'll never forget.  Till they cart you away when you're a jet.  You.  Oh, my God.  The lords.  The lords.  Oh, I can't wait to see Wackbag for the pictures they're going to make of that one.  Go to Photoshop on Wackbag.com.  Oh, how many leather jackets they're looking for on Google Images right now.  We're like in seventh grade, just tools.  Oh, complete idiots.  Why the lords, though?  I don't know.  I mean, why would they go to build something and let me and my dumb friend go pick out letters? 
[06:29:00]  I mean, there's no real reason for it.  We're homos.  Who are you, K'nicky?  We're all over the ball field today.  Let's say hi to Tony in Miami.  Tony.  What's up, Jack and Screech?  What's going on?  What's up, Tony?  Hey, hey, listen.  The first thing I was exposed to, of all porn, I was like eight.  My brother was like a twisted ass freak.  Kids are usually like playboys and hustlers.  He had Puritan.  Do you remember that porn?  Sure do, yeah.  Puritan was like the hardcore ass fucking porn. 
[06:29:30]  And my brother had like a huge like fucking pile of Puritans.  And one time I rubbed one out and I left one out, I guess.  And I went downstairs and my mom's this little old German lady, right?  And I guess she found it and she's like, hey, found something in your room.  And I'm like, oh shit.  And she goes, that's a hardcore porn.  So she started like freaking out and she just, I'm punching out.  Peace. 
[06:30:00]  He didn't even let me get to the crash.  The best part was we all just started looking at each other like, what?  What?  What's going on here?  I'm hitting buttons, tearing up for the crash.  I'm just waiting for him to stop and hit the crash and he punched out.  He could sense that you were looking for, what are those white things called?  The template.  That he knew you were looking to because it was so quiet.  He could hear the shuffle of the papers.  See, that's a punch out.  You can't punch out when you're done.  And some people get the crash and they go, all right, I'm punching out.  It's too late.  You're a ditch in the ground.  Mike from Jersey.  Hey, guys.  How you doing? 
[06:30:30]  All right, good.  Yeah, I got a good story.  Down the road from my house when we were kids, there was a piece of road there.  People used to flip stuff out the window all the time.  So occasionally you'd find a magazine on the side of the road.  But there was one day in particular that we were riding our bikes down the road, a friend  of mine and I, and we saw a magazine over on the side.  It was probably about a football field away.  So we both raced as fast as we could to see who could get it first.  We both got it at the same time.  We wound up getting an old fight over who's going to get to look at the magazine first.  It was kind of funny. 
[06:31:00]  You could rip it in half.  Hold on.  And trade.  It was pretty funny.  It was actually Cherry Magazine.  I don't think you guys remember that one.  I certainly do.  Yeah.  However, that wasn't funny.  Just to clarify, it wasn't funny at all.  Just to let you know, that wasn't really a funny story.  But it was interesting.  Go ahead and crash me.  No, it wasn't bad.  No, it was good.  West Virginia checking in.  It's John.  Hey, John.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  What's up, John?  Hi, Jimmy, you beefy tits.  Hi, John.  Let's not be insulting now.  It's Valentine's Day.  Hey, I was eight years old.  My dad introduced me to the two best pornos, Porky's and Roadhouse. 
[06:31:30]  I'm punching out.  Porky's and Roadhouse.  You know what magazine stunk?  Easy Rider.  That trash laying around.  What the hell was Easy Rider again?  It was that biker magazine, but it had naked chicks in it, too.  But they were the skankiest biker whores that you'd ever, ever see.  And it was like the...  I mean, if you're jacking it to the Sears catalog bra section, you know, it might be good 
[06:32:00]  because it's probably a little better than that to jack to.  But just those awful biker chicks, very selective magazines.  Didn't you start with, like, National Geographic, though?  No.  Always Playboy.  Started with Playboy.  Yeah, but you couldn't just get your hands on that when you were really little.  Let me think.  National Geographic might have been...  You know, you might be right.  I mean, you graduate up to the porn magazines, you know, because the National Geographic,  you start realizing that they're just awful naked women in there.  Yeah, well, it was, you know, the African women. 
[06:32:30]  At first, it was just the, oh, my God, naked women.  Then you have to go, you know, you're jonesing for more and more.  And then you eventually get up to the real porn magazines.  But you have to start somewhere.  National Geographic.  And with me, it was National Geographic.  We're going through the dictionaries and stuff and, I don't know, just finding...  Oh, you'd have to find wherever you could, yeah.  Wherever you could.  Dictionary.  Well, that's a bad example.  Whatever.  Medical book.  Yes.  You know, any type of books that the parents had around the house, you're leafing through,  hoping to, you know, catch a glimpse of something. 
[06:33:00]  You find a medical book and, like, thumb through it and find a picture of a woman with her eyes  covered over with a black strip so you can't tell who she is kind of a thing.  And, you know, it's a whole thing on psoriasis or something, so she's naked with psoriasis,  but she's naked.  That's exactly what I'm getting at.  Yeah, I know exactly what you're talking about.  And then you eventually...  You have to find whatever you could.  Yeah, and then eventually you start figuring out how to get your porn magazines.  It's like Thalidomide Woman.  She's got little flipper arms, but she's naked.  You know how I got my first porn magazines? 
[06:33:30]  I had a paper route.  Yeah.  And I noticed that, you know, people would, like, just leave, you know, their paper and  their magazines bundle up for the garbage man.  And, you know, you look through the stacks of that long enough, you'll find a porn magazine.  Yeah, they put them in the middle of the stack.  You know, it took some doing, and you would have to spend maybe a whole afternoon literally  going from house to house.  You know, I had scissors and everything just, you know, cutting the rope that was tied around 
[06:34:00]  it, and every once in a while I'd hit pay dirt.  Your kids just do not understand how lucky they are today with the internet.  It is amazing.  I mean, years ago you did.  You had to...  It was like a treasure hunt.  You were just hunting around for a photo, anything, one picture of a nude woman.  I remember my first porn movie.  I was...  I'll never forget it.  My buddy was an Indian fellow who lived across the street, and his dad had a VCR back in  those days.  Oh, cinnamon lips.  Yeah. 
[06:34:30]  They certainly were.  And his parents hated me.  But, you know, back in those days when they were doing very few VCRs, and I went and watched  a porno with him, we sat on the floor of his dad's room and watched The Fur Trap with  Kelly Mint, and it's an awful porno.  The Fur Trap, huh?  I had to walk out of his room and lay on the bathroom floor and whack my bag.  Really?  You were just so worked up.  I was laying on his parents' bathroom floor in these Indian people's house with my head  on the tile, scrapping all over myself.  Now, to this day, whenever he smells curry, he explodes on his stomach. 
[06:35:00]  I just couldn't handle it, though.  I could never watch with other people and enjoy porn.  I had to...  When I was a kid, once we found a super 8mm film.  Oh, my God.  It was a porno film.  How old are you?  Dude, it was years ago.  It was like the...  It was before, yeah, before friggin' VCRs, like the mid to late 70s, and had nothing  to play this time.  That's when your parents dropped you off at your friend's house with a horse and buggy?  I mean...  I know.  What year are you from?  Jesus!  It was a long time ago. 
[06:35:30]  So, now our quest, we had to find a super 8mm projector.  You knew it was porno, though?  Yeah, because, you know, we unraveled a little bit of it, but how much can you get looking  at a small 8mm film?  So, I mean, we were ready to tear the whole thing off the reel just to get each individual  picture, but I said, no, let's try to get a projector.  Finally ended up going to my alma mater, John H. Glenn High School, and telling one of the  AV teachers that we needed it. 
[06:36:00]  We have a film about...  It was something about history, we said, to help us study for big tests that was coming  up, and they let us sign out a projector.  Went to my friend Frank's house, who lived right around the corner from the high school,  set up the projector, and watched porno on the school's movie projector.  Oh, I know.  And it was just threading it through, and finally you turn that on, and...  Seeing porno like that, the worst 70s big earth mama muff, bad washed out color film, but it 
[06:36:30]  was great.  Pay dirt.  That's awesome.  Yeah.  Hard to get your porno.  You go to any of the porn theaters on Long Island growing up?  Went to one...  Bayshore, I think, was one of them?  Yeah, Bayshore was the one.  Yeah, went to it when I was working at some place.  Dude, we went, like, just as high school guys, like, we'd drink beers and then pay our admission  and go in there, but you felt so, like, you know...  You had to go with a bunch of guys.  Oh, yeah.  It was like a night out.  But there was a bunch of perverts in there, but it was like, yeah, this is a cool thing 
[06:37:00]  to do.  We'll drink a bunch of beers on the way over, and we'll go to the porno theater.  We went with a bunch of people from work once, just decided, yeah, let's go to the  porno, you know, and went down there, Bayshore, sat down, and just laughed our asses  off watching the porno, but it's like any other place, like even a strip club,  you get the group of guys that are friends there to drink beer and glance over at the  girl, but then you get the guy in the corner that's just drooling and telling the girl  that she looks like his daughter and, you know, giving dollars and stuff.  There are certain classifications of guys. 
[06:37:30]  The naive guy that just keeps giving his money away, the guy that thinks he's going  to get something, the only black guy in the white strip club, the old guy, you know,  and so you get those groups in the porn theaters, too.

Uh, let's use your car.  I just had mine washed.  You know, I'd love just one weekend that didn't involve getting rid of a corpse.  Ron and Fez on XM 202. 
[06:39:30]  Hi, I'm John Bondurian.  In case you didn't catch our live show from the Nokia Theater on the Boneyard,  we're going to give you another chance.  That's right, Christmas night.  An encore performance of Bon Jovi live in concert from New York City at the Nokia Theater.  Tomorrow at 9 p.m. Eastern, 6 Pacific, on XM 4-1, the Boneyard.  Merry Christmas to everybody. 
[06:40:00]  XM 202.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  Norton's cleft palate.  A caller calls in with an obvious speech impediment,  and that's all Jimmy needed to go off on a rant and trash this guy.  It's O.N.A.'s best bits.  Brian, what's up?  It's Brad, O.P.  What is it?  How you doing, man?  Brian, Brad.  What is your name?  Brad.  V-R-A-D?  Yeah.  Brad.  Brad.  I'm crippled with a high palate. 
[06:40:30]  You have a cleft palate?  Yeah.  Do you really?  Yeah.  Do you have an awful, like, Dave wants that mustache to not hide it?  F you, Norton.  Would I?  Would I?  Hair lip!  Hair lip!  Do you really have a cleft palate?  Yeah.  So what, so what, why are you getting mad at me for just teasing it?  I know you probably have, like, a thick, awful mustache, which has, like, a scar in  the middle of it, because all cleft palate mustaches have that lightning strike in the  middle.  What did this guy do to you?  I don't know what to guess, and he called up and said, I have a cleft palate.  What am I supposed to do, pretend it's kissable? 
[06:41:00]  Is it all fixed?  No, no.  Wait a minute.  You didn't, you never got it fixed?  Well, no, I have straight teeth and stuff, but it's not, no, it's not fixed.  Do you know what would help that?  If you put one end of a shotgun on it, and your toe, and your toe on the other end.  Shut up.  So bad.  Blow that bad lip off and have them put some waxed ones on there.  Anyways, I want to put what I learned today.  All right.  What'd you learn?  I learned nothing, because it's too effing early over here.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, you're in Sacramento.  It's very early.  Okay, very good.  Thanks, Brian.  I'm sorry I teased your freakishly misshapen lips, sir.  Make sure you listen to the replay. 
[06:41:30]  That's going to start in, like, ten minutes, I think.  I'm sure nobody notices when you're face down in the pillow.  Holy shit.  You don't even know this guy.  Why would he mention that he had a cleft palate?  Yeah, that isn't something you just bring up in conversation.  I could kind of hear it, because cleft palate people always talk.  They're just trying to hang on and talk properly, because half of their gums are hanging out.  There goes the cleft palate audience that we were trying to get.  We're losing the cleft palate audience.  I don't want you and your fucking horse gums listening.  You'll never work with Joaquin Phoenix for as long as you live.  That's right.  And the other one, what's his name?  Kareeb. 
[06:42:00]  What's his name?  Stacey Keach.  Stacey Keach.  There's another one.  And Cheech.  Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, color cane.  Stacey Keach.  Stacey Keach.  I didn't know Joaquin Phoenix had that.  Oh, yeah.  You can tell.  So he was yelling, help, help, while his brother was breakdancing in front of the Viper a few years ago.  Fucking faggot name.  It's a J, not a Y.  Hey, Joaquin.  Why are you so...  Help, help, help! 
[06:42:30]  Why are you so worked up today?  V-lip motherfucker.  I'm tired and my nose is stuffed.  Help.  Help.  Help.  He can't breathe.  Help.  We'll take a straight dance.  You're going after the easy targets today.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  How can you not?  Everyone in Pittsburgh has a cleft palate.  Awful city.  I had nine people on every show with a fucking improv.  I didn't know this was a touchy subject with you. 
[06:43:00]  How can it not be?  Calls it be the cleft palate.  We're supposed to go, hey, you're brave facing your injury.  Wow.  You know what you should do if you have a cleft palate?  Move to Alaska because it's night for half the year and people won't see it.  I got to build an igloo.  I live in that.  Awful.  What would you do if you brought home a girl and she had a cleft pussy lip?  You'd punch her in the stomach and kick her out. 
[06:43:30]  You wouldn't talk to her like she was an equal.  Stupid knife slash on the face lip.  Fuck off.  He's hurting me.  He's hurting me.  Oh, my God.  Imagine having to kiss that.  This is my kiss.  But his kiss is probably this.  Like that fucking half an awful.  Can I make out with the right side of the left tonight?  Holy ass.  Oh, that's got to be awful. 
[06:44:00]  Who punched you, son?  Oh, nobody.  I was going this way.  Ugh.  I'm sweating.  Where does this come from?  Always have to be careful you don't make B or P sounds or anything like this.  I'm a good boy.  I'm a good boy.  You're a good boy.  What is that?  Where does this come from?  What?  He really has a cleft palate problem for a long time.  Where did I just think of a cleft palate?  I saw a guy.  It was at a Starbucks. 
[06:44:30]  I was buying coffee one time.  And the kid behind me.  Starbucks?  Yeah, Starbucks.  He wanted a nice client.  I want anything as long as you don't speak.  Just nod.  Just nod.  If you have a cleft palate, where you should be is a bank robber.  Because it's acceptable to put a bandana across the lower half of your face.  Bank robber in the 1800s.  That should be your perfection of choice.  Oh, wow.  You know what they should say?  Yeah.  This should be every bit of dialogue in a hospital. 
[06:45:00]  Mr. and Mrs. fill in name here.  Your boy slash girl was born with a cleft palate.  And the parents should respond,  So how did you euthanize it?  Wow.  Not to break it up, look at Ozzy's daughter's tits.  Oh, my God.  Is that Kelly?  Wow.  Kelly Osbourne's tits are huge. 
[06:45:30]  Those are fat tits, though.  They're fat tits.  Yeah.  But that's, you know, she still has youth with her, so it's okay.  Not really, man.  She has a good eight inches of cleavage.  Yeah, but she's wearing the low cut, so you're not paying attention to how awful the rest of her body is.  Yeah, but look at the cleavage.  Behind Ben's head.  Anyone else notice that only the fat girls dye their hair like that?  No, you want to take the attention off of the...  Exactly.  Fat girls like to dye their hair crazy colors so you don't notice how fat they are.  So, she's got such a cute face. 
[06:46:00]  That's not a bad suggestion.  So, by the way...  Those are nice.  Those are nice, though.  Ugh.  Norton, how much would you love to bang her just to say you banged her?  I would love to, but I also want to throw out the suggestion.  I don't want to say the name again, but if you're one of these people walking around with an unpleasant split lip,  dye yourself from the neck down a color like pink or yellow so people don't look at you above the shoulders.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  So, this is when Norton hurt his foot. 
[06:46:30]  There was a panel underneath the console and it fell and it hurt his foot because it fell on the foot.  Well explained, asshole.  ONA's best bits.  But it hurt his foot.  We know.  Classic rock.  Classic rock that really rocks, everybody.  The home of classic rock.  That's the new one.  Classic rock that really rocks.  Really rock.  Oh, there's other classic rock out there.  Do they really rock?  I'm not sure.  They really rock.  Let me take a look at my list here. 
[06:47:00]  Here's Harp with Barracuda.  Those radio, and I've worked for all of them, so, you know, but I always thought it was such a stupid thing.  The home of rock and roll and all the other rock stations in your area.  They're not the home of rock and roll.  No.  We're the home of rock and roll.  Ah!  Oh, no.  Right on my fucking foot!  That fucking thing fell again right on my fucking foot!  This could be a problem.  I don't mean to laugh. 
[06:47:30]  I just love shit like this.  I can't tell you how many times last week I asked for this to be fixed, and it just fell  on my fucking bad foot.  I have a foot thing on my foot, and it just fell on it.  Don't laugh.  I'm joking.  He has a foot thing on his foot.  He has a foot thing on his foot.  Why did that fall again?  Why did that fall again on my bad foot? 
[06:48:00]  He's got one of those bad foot.  Dude, I got a foot on my foot because I have tendinitis, I have arthritis, and I have ligament  damage.  He's got old man foot.  And right on my goddamn foot.  That's the third time that fucking thing has fucking fallen.  Third time.  Holy shit, is that aggravating.  Anthony and Jimmy are very serious, and me and Bob can't stop laughing.  It should not have fallen again. 
[06:48:30]  Right on my foot.  Holy shit.  I saw his face.  He just heard that freaking whack.  Scared the shit out of everybody, and then you look at this.  It did scare me, man.  He looked like a stress doll.  Somebody squeezed his gut.  And then he just snapped.  I got a foot thing on my fucking foot.  Look at his foot.  I got an arm thing on my foot.  Look at this thing. 
[06:49:00]  Look at this thing.  Look at this thing.  He has to wear.  Big foot thing.  I have enough problems.  He's going snowboarding after the show.  I'm trying to avoid surgery.  Yeah.  And I have stage four damage.  I have stage three damage.  I'm one inch from surgery, and I want to bite somebody's fucking face for that.  How did that happen?  I want to know who fixed that.  Are you on the AZT for the stage?  Why did it not happen?  Why was that not fixed?  No one fixed it.  It wasn't fixed.  Holy shit.  Is that irritating?  It was fixed.  It wouldn't have fallen.  How big was the thing that fell, though? 
[06:49:30]  It's this big.  It's a piece of it.  What is it?  It's solid.  And it falls.  It's like, it's probably eight inches off the ground.  Opie probably has fishing string over there.  Just, all right, right now, again.  Quack.  My fucking foot.  I got a foot of a foot on my foot.  That fucking foot.  I want that fixed.  Immediately.  Right in the middle of my goddamn fucking foot. 
[06:50:00]  It's so, I am so.  You're leaving Wednesday.  They'll never fix it.  Do you people think at HBO there's going to be stuff falling on his foot?  We're going to lose Jimmy because he's not going to want to come back to like the things  falling on his feet.  Bingo Pants has a great idea now, though.  Come on.  Bingo Pants.  How you doing?  Hey.  Can you guys put that thing that fell on Jimmy's foot on the auction, too?  Yeah, now it's a famous thing.  It's famous.  It's a famous thing.  It's a thing that fell on his foot.  What happened is if his foot goes to stage four, we can just put his foot up. 
[06:50:30]  Under the console, it's six inches off the ground, there's like a little shelf, and  this is up on top of that, so it's falling from a height.  Yeah.  Look at that.  It's not that high, but when the end of that smashes your foot, it hurts.  Look at that.  Holy shit.  And I asked for that last week to be fixed.  There was screws coming out of it.  I understand.  Whatever, man.  I'm just going to start really being fucking nasty.  Yes.  When you ask for something to be fixed like that because it's a physical hazard, why isn't 
[06:51:00]  it done?  We have a lot of audio that proves that you asked for it to be fixed.  Holy fucking shit.  Is that annoying?  Oh, man.  That's really funny.  Yeah.  It's not like your karma didn't deserve that.  I hate him.  I hope he dies of cancer.  Fuck them.  You die.  Then you have something fall on your foot.  Exactly.  It's not right.  The universe came back and smashed your foot.  Wow.  Holy shit.  You okay?  Don is in New York today, so we'll get it fixed.  Oh, it's all fixed, Charles?  Why don't you send it?  Don, just fucking throw it over there.  If they put it up, I'm going to throw it through the window. 
[06:51:30]  What?  Feel how heavy that is.  Can somebody want to weigh that?  That is so heavy.  And what it's got are these little fasteners that aren't working, I guess.  Hey, Ryan from Florida Feels for Jimmy.  Let's say hi to Ryan.  A lot of people feeling for you right now.  Go ahead, Ryan.  Hey, man.  What the hell's up with that prima donna?  Prima donna.  Dude, I'm sitting here and something falls on my injured foot that I asked for to be fixed.  I didn't say it's painted the wrong color.  It fell on my foot. 
[06:52:00]  Here it goes.  There's tears coming from all the blue-collar workers out there that fall off the ladders  and stuff every day and just get up and go back to work without saying a word.  Well, dude, first of all, then, fuck them.  They're cowards.  I didn't walk off the job.  I'm still here.  But what do guys do when they fall off a ladder?  First of all, I didn't fall off a ladder.  If something fell on your foot, that's like, you know, getting a cut or something on your  hand and, you know, I have to go to the emergency room or something for another cut.  Yeah, really?  Is that what it's like?  Stupid.  It fell on my foot.  I asked for it to be fixed.  And let me tell you something. 
[06:52:30]  If I was a painter and I asked for something to be fixed and it fell, I'd complain.  Any painter or any other job would complain, blue-collar or not.  Nothing ever gets fixed, man.  Well, that's annoying.  You need someone to hold your hand, Jimmy?  No.  It's just annoying, dude.  You're in the middle of something and you just feel it smash your foot.  Yeah.  And you've asked for it to be fixed and it's not fixed and it's like one of a million things  he asked for if it got done.  If we were working construction, sir, I don't think it would be a problem because it would  be something that happens on a daily basis. 
[06:53:00]  When you come in to do a radio show every day, you don't expect to have heavy things falling  on you.  Yeah, but Jason from Michigan makes a good point.  I'm going to add to it.  If you didn't throw the power drill away, you could have freaking fixed that thing.  Could have fixed it yourself, Jimmy.  Crawled under there and drilled a few zip screws in.  Exactly.  But you had to throw the drill away because it wasn't good enough for you.  He's a fancy man.  I smell foot diva.  Fancy feet.  Foot diva promo on the way.  The problem is this.  I've been having a serious problem with my foot.  I am worried about it and I'm trying to take care of it. 
[06:53:30]  I'm fucking hobbling around on this cocksucker awful boot and I have to worry about sticking  my fucking feet under the console and having shit fall.  I would love to get that weight and see how much that weighs.  That really, right on the bone of my foot.  I'd say about four pounds.  Not four pounds.  How did your foot get so screwed up?  Yeah.  Because I had twisted it.  I have falling arches or whatever I have.  My feet are a mess so I needed orthotics.  Yeah.  So when you have problems with your feet like that, you stand a certain way subconsciously. 
[06:54:00]  You don't realize my foot really hurts.  I'm really, really angry.  Oh, boy.  That's how I messed up my knee.  I'm sorry.  I was still talking about my foot.  Yeah.  Why do you, when you hurt something though, you have to keep repeating the body part.  My knee and he's like, my foot, my foot.  I have a foot thing on my foot.  I didn't know what to say.  See how funny this can be when it's not you?  See?  See?  I hurt my head.  My foot, dude.  It's a foot thing on my foot.  I didn't know what it was called.  Is there a way that during commercials or something you could pull him losing his mind when that 
[06:54:30]  fall?  Because I've got to hear it again.  He lost his mind right there.  Dude, you know what it is?  My foot hurt last night because I had the bandage wasn't as tight as it has been.  I was trying to get a looser bandage on it.  And today, now it's throbbing.  And I'm just, I'm so, I want to kick something.  Not with this foot thing.  What would they do if they had to do surgery?  Like you said, what would they be doing to your foot?  They would go, I don't know.  I have, I know on the left side of my right foot, I have, it's a bone problem. 
[06:55:00]  And on the right side, it's a nerve.  I was getting like, I was getting like numbness in my leg for months when I would sit.  It was like a sciatic problem.  This genius doctor I go to, she helped.  So far, I have none of that leg numbness anymore.  She's fixing me.  Yeah.  She's fixing me.  It's slow.  And she puts a medicated bandage on it.  But I got tendinitis.  I got a little arthritis.  I got so fucked up because I twisted it twice.  Never.  And now you guys know how I was.  I was hobbling along since like May.  You're a bad little paw. 
[06:55:30]  I finally got it fixed.  And it's like a slow process.  But I can't be in a cast.  I got to, you know, whatever.  I got to be out there doing.  You got show bits.  You can't have stuff falling on your foot either.  No.  Dude, that's what annoys me is shit happens.  But when you say, look, I have a problem with my thing here.  I'm injured.  Can you not have that thing underneath the desk falling on it?  Say your foot.  For the third.  I know you're right.  Say your foot, you jicken.  Don't say my thing.  I'm not a jicken, stupid.  We're going to find the audio.  Halloween.  But I think I caused that. 
[06:56:00]  Because someone said something really funny.  And I either hit this really hard or kicked something under my thing.  And I think that was all it took.  Yeah.  Because this thing was barely, you know, barely hanging on.  Well, dude, if you caused it by doing this.  That's not sturdy worksmanship.  No.  Worksmanship.  I said it.  Worksmanship.  This is worksmanship.  I really have never done a real man's work in my life.  No.  I want to get some elbow grime.  No, no, no.  Opie and Anthony's best bits. 
[06:56:30]  Best Jim Alfirst.  Fat belly achers.  Shut up.  Fuck him.  This next bit is Dragon Wagon.  Dragon Wagon called in and didn't like XM, right?  Yes, Travis.  And all the truckers love this bit, so they're going to be happy to hear it again.  You know, I saw Dragon Wagon.  Was he fork-knifed, Jack?  Oh, good.  Got a new flub.  All right. 
[06:57:00]  Well, now what were you trying to say, Travis?  It's about a fork and a knife.  I think you were sitting down having a meal with Dragon Wagon.  And here's the bit.  Let's say hi to Dragon Wagon.  Yeah.  Guys, you totally.  What?  What?  You broke up.  We can't hear you.  You totally offended me today.  We totally.  I was an over-the-road truck driver, and this dude of these things that you're all talking  about is ridiculous.  What are you talking about? 
[06:57:30]  The what thing, sir?  Did you take an antihistamine before you call next time?  You clogged-nosed idiot.  You guys are disgusting.  I mean, you know, I turned it on.  I'm calling XM and complaining about this channel.  Let's all of this do it.  Really?  Yeah.  What don't you like about the channel?  Well, you guys are hacks.  It wouldn't be Howard Stern.  Yeah.  I mean, you know, it's decent.  It's immoral what you're talking about.  You know what you should do, sir?  Right after you call XM, you should drink a fifth of old granddad and then drunk drive 
[06:58:00]  into a schoolyard.  No one cares about you or if you're offended.  Block the channel, stupid.  It's an XL channel.  You can block it.  That's why XM has that.  You need to ask you.  That's what you need to do, okay?  I'm hanging up.  Good.  Hang up.  Cancel XM and drop dead.  Let's not go that far.  All right.  Don't cancel XM.  Go to listen to XM Kids or something.  Yeah, exactly.  Maybe that's the wrong thing to say in front of Eric Logan.  And this guy, now he's listening to himself. 
[06:58:30]  He'll be listening.  Listen, I'm going to Sirius Radio.  Good.  Go to Sirius Radio.  There's a fucking dog for the thing.  They stink.  You're going to have to drive a truck to have Sirius.  Throw it in the back of the truck, you fucking hick.  Die.  See, get in front of me.  I'll run you over.  Why don't you fucking blow your nose before you call a national radio show, you crank-doing  jerk-off?  Now he's listening to himself.  Of course he is. 
[06:59:00]  He'll be listening.  Of course he will.  He'll be listening.  He'll call tomorrow.  And he doesn't even have the balls to say, fuck you.  We're uncensored, pal.  You can say, fuck you.  I don't believe in that.  You don't believe in that?  You're a liar and you're a failure.  No, I'm not a failure.  Yes, you are.  I'm an over-the-road truck driver.  Why don't you have your fucking sinuses fixed?  I'm an over-the-road truck driver.  Yeah, all truck drivers are over-the-road, stupid.  They don't go through lawns and pools.  You redundant shithead. 
[06:59:30]  You are a good buddy.  You are a good buddy.  I didn't hear you, sir.  I'm doing drugs and surviving an incest experience.  Is that his name, Dragon Wagon?  Dragon Wagon.  You got your ears on.  Oh, yeah. 
[07:00:00]  I'm sorry.  You sounded like you had more brains on the radio.  Hold on, sir.  Wait, sir.  Is your name really...  Dude, is your name really Dragon Wagon?  You're a grown man with a name that rhymes?  Hey, slow down with the weird grown-up names.  Yeah, that's a childhood name.  At least it doesn't rhyme.  It's not Mopey Opie.  It's Mopey Opie. 
[07:00:30]  Slim Jim.  And whatever the fuck rhymes with Anthony.  I can't think of anything.  Shmanthony.  Well, if you don't understand,  I'm out of here busting my ass  for you people to be doing your dumb radio show.  What are you...  How are you busting your ass for us, stupid?  You're busting your ass to put food on your fat wife's table.  We have nothing to do with it.  Well, at least I got a wife  and I don't go to bed with another man like you.  I don't go to bed with other men.  If I was, I'd molest your children.  What are you thinking of them apples, fat boy?  What are you going to do 
[07:01:00]  if we stop delivering our roads out of here  and you don't have toilet paper to wipe your nasty rear end?  I don't need toilet paper.  I hire prostitutes to clean it with their hands.  And my father was a truck driver.  So I like truck drivers.  It's you I don't like.  No.  You're the type that voted for George Bush, aren't you?  You're the type that...  No, sir.  I don't vote.  I talk a lot of shit  and then I sit home on election day.  That's the beauty of me.  But you're the reason the fuel prices are so hot  in this country driving...  I'm the reason you motherfucker.  You drive a truck. 
[07:01:30]  I have a Saturn.  I cruise prostitutes in Manhattan.  The food has to get there.  You have fucking 80 gallons of fuel in your vehicle.  I go a month on a gallon of gas.  43rd Street to 15th Street.  Circle for four hours.  Back home.  Why don't you get a Toyota Hybrid?  What?  Why don't you get a Toyota Hybrid or something  if Dave's Fuel is running around fuel prices out?  What do you...  Why don't I get a Hybrid?  You're driving an 18-wheeler.  Yeah.  But I have to.  This is a purpose.  You know... 
[07:02:00]  It's a purpose?  What are you talking about, dude?  What the fuck are you talking about?  You're not this man who's making a difference.  If you died,  some other fatso would sit right where you're sitting  and go,  drive, gas, go.  Nobody would miss you.  He could go home and fuck your wife.  She wouldn't even notice it, wasn't you.  Well, I'll tell you what.  You just keep on going down with your little radio show.  I'm calling next to him.  I'm making a complaint.  We got the...  The head of programming is right here.  I got logged. 
[07:02:30]  He's not happy.  I got it.  Dragon wagon is not happy.  I haven't.  Yeah, dragon wagon.  I will pray for you.  We got it.  I will pray for you.  You're going to pray for me?  Do something else while you're on your knees in a rest area,  you fucking fat glory hole loving nobody.  I will put you on my church's playlist.  You do that.  And then you should fucking hook it up to the church.  I fucked that one up.  Fuck.  You were rolling.  You were rolling.  Wow.  Without an error for the whole time. 
[07:03:00]  That's all right.  I just couldn't think of the jerk reference real quick.  Oh.  Ah, dragon wagon got me.  Let me have a Diablo sandwich or Dr. Pepper.  Make it fast.  I'm in a goddamn hurry.  Hey, hey, dragon wagon.  He hung up.  He hung up.  Oh, did he really?  Yes.  Fuck.  Soon as I get home, the first thing I'm going to do is punch your mama in the mouth.  We haven't had one of those jerk offs in a long time.  Isn't it great?  I hope you're listening right now as you're rolling over in a ditch.  Isn't it great?  I love it.  Being on the premium channel, when we were on premium, we never really got those. 
[07:03:30]  We can do no wrong.  As somebody who's been a fan of this show, it's been such a long time since I've heard  one of those calls.  We haven't had one of those.  A guy that has XM, he's going through the channels, he hears us, and of course he's  captivated by it.  He's got to listen.  He can't just turn it off.  There's something about being offended and hating something to the point where you can't  tune away from it.  And guaranteed, he's still listening. 
[07:04:00]  He will be listening tomorrow, and he will continue to listen.  Well, and you know what, though?  But he gives truckers a bad name.  We love truckers.  Oh, well, of course.  We have a whole channel, Open Road.  I love them.  They're listening to Hank's Place, too.  That's awesome.  I love the Hank's Place.  We're getting all nervous.  Relax, dude.  The truckers aren't going anywhere.  I'm protecting the $12.95 a month.  You hear how fast he jumped in when I said, cancel XM?  Well, don't get crazy.  It's hasty now.  I'm going to want the dragon wagon. 
[07:04:30]  I'll pay for it for a year just so I can hear that again.  I mean, that was worth it.  Dragon wagon.  I hope he hits an accident and then he's dragging limbs.  I hope your whole left side has paralyzed you, fatso.  Opie and Anthony's Best Bits.  Most Festus Sweeper.  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Number four.

[07:07:30]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  XM 202.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Hi, it's Travis from The Opie and Anthony Show.  And this is when Bernie loses it.  Bernie gets came in studio and Opie made him lose it.  On Opie's best bits.  Should I do anything else with that?  No.  You nailed it.  Bernie loves the Weekly World News.  Yeah.  Hey, can you believe this?  There's an article, this is a new revelation about history that the Vikings were sissies.  They were actually sissies. 
[07:08:00]  The Vikings were sissies?  And they used that word sissies?  Yeah.  Wow, I hope I believe that.  You see that one Weekly World News where the headline was, Bernie gets to the point?  Well, this is the news.  This is the news.  I see it.  There's a bunch of pictures of dead animals and stuff.  I can't understand what that is.  That's just for shock value.  There's a crossword puzzle.  I wouldn't even know how to do that.  And then other, let's see, nonsense, some personal ads. 
[07:08:30]  Six-letter word for target starts with N.  Here's something everyone here could learn.  Strip club adequate.  Ten essential do's and don'ts.  Okay?  Okay?  Wait, wait.  What was that?  I missed that.  Oh, look.  And there's another.  Oh, so what?  That's it.  And look, here's another article.  The Republicans now, they're fighting for Caucasian History Month.  Oh, and they show a picture of Donald Trump shouting with Ronald Reagan standing in the background. 
[07:09:00]  I bet you'd be honored during that month.  They won Caucasian History Month.  I would honor you during that month.  Wait, I'm going to say, where's that other thing?  I want to hear what?  What month is he on the Klan calendar?  This is a new one.  Just hit the news.  They have him shirtless for July.  Strip club.  Was it strip club?  What was the name of that?  Oh, look.  Here's other stuff.  History.  Jesus drove his brother to drink.  It's possible.  And it quits.  Get Craig Christ ready.  That's how we'll end it.  Craig Christ from Stephen Lynch.  This is about vegetarian.  They're showing giant pictures of mutant vegetables. 
[07:09:30]  Mutant vegetables.  This is horrible.  Anyway, I'm going to take this home and read it.  Hold on.  Can you go back to the stripper etiquette?  We'll end with stripper etiquette.  Oh, what is there?  You know, you just do nothing.  You know, buy drinks.  Put money in their belt and say nothing is usually the best thing.  Right.  Just look.  Look and enjoy.  Bernie, would you like to go to a strip club with us?  Nah.  No?  No, why not?  We'll take you out.  Oh, thanks.  That'd be fun.  Nah.  Nah?  Nah.  It's just...  Nah.  Definitely.  Nah.  Nah.  Yeah.  Wow.  Nah.  Okay. 
[07:10:00]  Better porno on the internet.  Gotta get bullets.  That's the news.  And no news is good news.  You're safe from the horrible story.  Definitely easy to shoot a gun and drive a car.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Laugh at me.  I'll get out of here.  I'm a good shooter.  I'm a good shooter.  Definitely a good shooter.  Definitely a good shooter.  Yeah.  And I want my CD back.  What CD?  That one CD.  You played one CD of that nice music in the beginning.  Of course, Wapner comes on it.  That was the arm.  Yeah.  Remember that arm you played one music of that?  You played about a minute and a half of that?  Oh, my God. 
[07:10:30]  Yeah.  Goddamn, Bernie.  I love when you come on.  Yeah.  I love when you come on.  The first 40 minutes were quite boring, but, man, you made up for it.  You made up for it for the last 10 minutes.  Well, I didn't mean to.  I thought it was the worst.  What did we learn, Anthony?  That Jesus Christ drove his own brother to drink.  His fat chicks make sexy faces sometimes.  Do the first have adequate.  Adequate.  It's easier to shoot a pistol than to drive a car with one hand.  Yeah.  Osma Bin Laden. 
[07:11:00]  Oh, Bernie, what are you doing, Bernie?  Of Osma.  It's right here.  It's right here.  Oh, yeah.  Wait.  No, no, no.  You got to go out of the machine.  Yeah, sit down, Bernie.  It's the thing.  No.  It's right there.  Oh, yeah, sit down.  I'll get it to you.  We're going to say goodbye to you.  Wow.  You rule, Bernie.  Bernie.  No.  No.  This one, right?  It says arm on the front.  Oh.  What are you?  You motherfucker.  Tony.  Oh, you're asking for trouble.  Tony.  Oh, my God.  Oh, Bernie, Bernie, sit down.

It's getting real hot in here.  Bernie, you don't have to take that.  You don't have to take that, Bernie.  All right, sit down.  Stand up to your right, Bernie.  Sit down, Bernie.  Sit down.  It's okay.  It's okay.  It's okay, Po. It's okay. Po, it's okay. Po, it's okay. Po, it's okay. 
[07:12:00]  All right, have Bernie sit down. Let's see.  Let's all calm down.  It's all right.  Po.  I'm all ready to get that fucking CD.  Yeah.  Hand over that fucking CD.  Oh, you got to have another.  You lunatic.  Relax.  All right, Bernie. He's Frank Bird.  Oh, he's fine, Po.  You tell him to relax.  Po, he's fine.  You tell him to relax.  Yeah, tell him.  Yeah, everyone just relax.  Nobody relax.  All he did was take the CD out.  Yeah, fuck you. Keep your CD. I won't be here again. 
[07:12:30]  Bernie.  Bernie.  Bernie.  Bernie.  Bernie.  Bernie.  Bernie.  Bernie's leaving.  Oh, man.  See, you got his CD.  Give him his CD.  Oh, you ruined it.  Bring him back in.  Give him his CD.  No, we'll explain what happened.  We'll explain what happened.  Bring him back in.  Bernie.  Bernie.  Oh, he's going into his bag.  He's going into his bag.  No, he's at Bernie.  It's okay.  Bernie, we got the CD.  We got the CD.  Oh, he's pissed.  Oh, my God.  Wait, follow him out with the cell phone.  Make sure he knows we never... 
[07:13:00]  It was a fake CD.  No, follow him out with the cell phone.  Opie took a fake...  It wasn't his CD.  Oh, was it a CD?  No, of course not.  And he lost his mind.  Of course not.  Did you get him into the CD?  Eric's going after him.  He says he's going to shoot you now.  Holy shit.  He was pissed.  Look, I think we saw some of that rage.  That was that rage.  Yeah.  Wow, that was it.  That was like one of those bad court dramas on TV where the guy finally snaps on the stand.  Finally cracks him.  The lawyer cracks him.  All right, I did it.  See?  All right, hold on.  I think...  And I'm not sorry.  I'd do it again.  All right, let's go to the phones here. 
[07:13:30]  There we go.  Jesus.  Bernie, this is your CD right there.  Okay, thank you.  That's not the one he...  Relax, that's not the one.  That's yours.  Tell him...  That's the one he used in the studio.  Eric, it's great yours.  Eric, explain.  Explain what we do.  Bernie, the joke, he had another CD.  Well, whatever.  It was a separate CD.  Sure?  It was totally...  Take a look at it.  It's not even broken or damaged.  Anyway, it's okay.  Why don't you relax?  Why don't you relax?  No, no, no.  I want to go...  It's 9 o'clock.  They want to go home anyway.  They still want to call you.  Go back inside and at least... 
[07:14:00]  Let's not burn bridges, let's go back in.  Come back in and talk.  He's coming in.  Nice to meet you.  Wait, that sounds scary.  He's coming in.  They just want to talk to you.  I hope he's building a barrier.  All right, Bernie.  I'm waiting for you.  Sit down, sit down.  Sit down.  Sit down.  Sit down.  No, it's 9 o'clock.  Bernie, let me explain what happened, though, Bernie.  I can't explain what happened.  Wait, put on your headphones.  Let me explain.  Yeah.  Because I don't want...  Because we really like you.  We want you to be a friend of the show.  I love Bernie Getz, and I don't want to...  I don't want to get off on the wrong foot here. 
[07:14:30]  We felt like...  Here.  I'm listening.  I'm listening.  We felt like you were a friend of the show, that we could pull one of our gags on you.  That's all that was.  It was a joke.  It was a joke.  Here's the...  Wait, here.  I'm going to show you.  Calm down.  Here's the CD I was smashing.  Okay, I didn't know that.  Okay.  Here's...  The CD I was smashing was called Haunted Pussy.  Oh, okay.  That's okay.  It had nothing to do with the one that...  You were smashing Haunted Pussy!  You smashed up!  Bernie, I never touched your CD.  I took this one, and Eric snuck it in and, you know, made the old switcheroo.  Bernie, we're still pals? 
[07:15:00]  Things are okay.  All right.  Things are okay.  I'm glad we had this story.  I'm glad we had this story.  A friend of mine.  I consider you...  Okay, or just...  Or whatever.  Bernie, look at your CD.  You think you're okay.  Bernie does not like...  It's okay.  Look at your CD.  There's not a scratch on it.  I didn't smash you.  I trust you.  All right?  Just look at it.  I thought we were at that stage in our friendship that we could pull one of our gags on you.  That's all.  Why do you smash your CD, though?  It's like...  It's like...  I mean, it wasn't as bad as what if someone took your kid and said,  I'm hanging your kid out the window like Michael Jackson.  Well, there you go. 
[07:15:30]  That hand.  I don't.  That hand.  Only a CD.  There you go.  All right, Bernie.  So we're cool.  We're cool.  And anyway, that's the news for the week.  Thank you, Bernie.  Okay?  Very good.  Bernie gets everybody.  Now that everybody knows what's happening in the world, you know...  I hear you.  And it's...  All right.  It's up on...  Phew!  Yeah, that was cool in the gang.  That was intense.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Now I know what those guys felt on that subway.  I'll tell you that much.  Just all night and day, the way he could turn it on.  Yeah.  He really turned it on.  Oh, what a quick fuse. 
[07:16:00]  What?  That's not a slow burn.  You taking the subway home?  Everything's cool, Bernie.  Everything's open.  Shut the fuck up!  We're going to be like little Fonzies.  And what's Fonzie, Bernie?  I don't know.  Cool.  Cool.  Oh, yeah.  That's okay.  All right.  Yeah, Bernie, we didn't watch you.  We didn't watch you.  It's going to be a mild winter.  Mild winter.  We didn't watch you going away mad.  Is that right?  All right.  Is that yours?  Oh, you dropped something, Bernie?  All right.  There you go.  Okay.  Now let's take the same speed jacket he was probably wearing back.  Absolutely.  Absolutely. 
[07:16:30]  All right.  Thank you, Bernie.  Thank you, Bernie.  Bernie, guys.  We'll talk to you again soon.  Is this Bernie?  Is this yours?  Oh, yes.  No, no.  All right.  It's...  Yeah.  Say again?  Yes, you did.  He was coming back in.  All right.  He's walking out.  Wow, man.  Holy shit.  Wow.  That was legendary.  Dude, that was the rage.  That was what happened on that train.  Oh, my God.  I'm not even kidding.  That was what happened on that train.  We saw it.  We saw it.  Yeah.  Eric was in between me and Bernie, and I got to give Eric a lot of credit, man. 
[07:17:00]  He was holding him back.  He was out of his mind.  Hey, you know what's odd?  We were talking about Rain Man, and when you were watching Rain Man, remember, it was  kind of like you look at Dustin Hoffman and go, it's not too bad.  He's a little kooky and stuff, but he seems nice and sweet.  And then that time he lost it at the airport, he just lost his mind.  That's what we saw.  That snap.  That was right now.  You just threw his CD.  It was like a Pop-Tart in the toaster, and a little smoke billowed up, and he couldn't  handle it.  Right.  Imagine that.  You didn't see it coming. 
[07:17:30]  No.  It came out of nowhere.  Fuck you.  Keep your CD.  Keep your CD.  Fuck you.  And take this with you.  You have another.  Keep your CD.  Wow.  Wow.  Yeah.  I have...  Look at me.  I'm so...  I'm shaking.  I am shaking.  Dude, you had a pissed Bernie guest right here in your face.  And there's no reasoning with him when he's that mad. 
[07:18:00]  You can't reason with him.  No.  No.  He just walked out.  He was convinced you smashed that CD of his.  That was one of his things.  You see how he was looking for it before you made Like He Smashed It?  He came over to Opie's area, looked through those CDs that Opie's got in front of him,  going, there was a CD.  I have it.  Because he needs to know where everything is.  Yeah.  Very particular.  Yeah.  Or there's something wrong with him in the world.  Yeah.  And then he sat back down.  You told him that the CD you had in your hand was the CD in question. 
[07:18:30]  And when you started smashing it, the look on his face, that's when he snapped.  Keep your fucking CD.  Rawr.  Wow.  Eric, is he all right?  He's gone.  Eric, you...  I have to tell you.  You rock.  No problem.  Eric got in between me and Bernie.  Bernie was literally like, what?  He kept kneeing me in the legs.  I'm like, stop.  He's like, give me my CD, my CD.  And I'm sitting here with this hand, trying to cover his real CD so he doesn't see it.  And Opie's just sitting there going, oh my God.  Could you imagine if he's got to go on the subway right now? 
[07:19:00]  Some black guy is in his seat or something?  Oh, forget it.  With an iPod?  Disrespecting CDs?  All right.  Bernie, what's the matter?  Hot water burn baby.  Hot water burn baby.  Fucking psychopath.  Why don't we take a break?  We have Billy Burr in studio.  And that's the news for today.  Keep your fucking CD.  I pushed the CD in the case.  It does this when it's told.  It does this when it's told. 
[07:19:30]  And you want your CD, Bernie?  Would you?  Wait a minute.  Would she a great big black person?  We're going to do that.  That CD, was that track 14?  Wow.  We're going to take a break, Anthony.  Billy Burr in studio, like I said.  And also, we have Joe Rogan's gangster fag stuff that he wants to turn us on to.  We'll finally play a few tracks from that next, okay?  Fine.  Keep your fucking CD.  But first, you know, Bernie Goetz was talking about how Jesus Christ, you know, drove his own brother to drink. 
[07:20:00]  He was.  I forgot everything that happened.  I know.  Well, it's just...  Before that snap.  It's just a segue to...  Yeah, bud.  Just a segue.  The heart rate's still up.  I know.  That was really, like, exciting.  Poe came in here with the...  He was the second most crazy person in this room.  That look in his eyes.  And he went to grab Bernie, and Bernie was, like, pissed.  Everyone was just out of their minds.  He was in the other room calming down, doing his little...  Oh, doing his calm down procedure.  Did they get video of that? 
[07:20:30]  Yeah, we have it all.  Danny was in here the whole time?  Yep.  He was sitting right there with the camera.  Oh, nice.  Get Danny in here.  I've got to see how the video looks.  Did Poe make a wrong turn and go into the production studio first before he came in here?  I don't know what happened.  But did he know the directions to get here, to this studio?  The problem is, in his office, there's a delay, so he was hearing it late.  Oh, wow.  Hot in here.  Yeah, he heard that I was getting hot.  It looks like rain.  Oh, it certainly looks like rain tonight.  John. 
[07:21:00]  Yo.  Hey.  How fucking crazy are you to piss off Bernie Katz in the goddamn studio?  Yeah, that's not smart.  Yeah, I hope he's an idiot.  And Asner's one thing, he's 80.  Yeah, what's that Asner going to do?  And that has never shot anyone.  Exactly.  It's not like it's Psycho Patty or anything, man.  Wow, yeah.  Dude, I never expected him to go like that.  I thought he'd get a little pissed off and bummed out.  I never expected him to lose his mind like he did.  All right. 
[07:21:30]  All right, thank you.  Master Poe, you all right?  No, no.  I'm going to talk to Marcelino, and I'm going to find out.  What?  What's up?  What's up?  I want to get a patch directly into my room because this delay is no good.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, that's why.  Yeah.  All right.  My heart is...  It's all good, bro.  You did great.  You did great.  It's good.  But I'm going to get a patch.  What do you do to calm down, Poe?  I heard, like, you just kind of sit...  Poe is pissed off now, too.  Poe is freaking right now.  Nothing was going to happen.  If it came down to it, all of us would have piled on Bernie. 
[07:22:00]  We just didn't want to go there.  That's all.  That's what they call in the zone right now.  Well, plus, there's not many problems in the studio, so when there is one, you're the security  guy.  You don't want to, like, not be there.  15-second delay.  A lot can happen.  I'm sure, though, he shot those four guys in a lot less than 15 seconds on that subway.  Yeah.  Bernie can do a lot of damage.  Yeah.  Meanwhile, you know, no one's hearing it.  Please.  No one hears...  Yeah, you're the security guy, 15 seconds after the fact. 
[07:22:30]  He's hearing what's going on.  We're going to have a direct patch.  This is what we do, though.  We create major havoc, and the only ones that are enjoying it are you and I.  Oh, I know.  Poe's pissed.  Everyone's freaked now.  Ben is on the phone with Washington now.  Why do you say we?  There's one problem in the studio.  There's one fucking irritant constantly hurting and annoying guests.  Poking and prodding a Bernie guest.  Always.  But I'm saying, you guys enjoy it, though.  Yes.  Of course.  It was incredible.  Who else was freaked out when he was running for his bag?  Bernie's driving on his way to a pawn shop right now. 
[07:23:00]  That's right.  Todd from California.  That man wants to be the mayor?  I know.  Jesus.  He might have wrecked his whole campaign.  I hope he'd be the guy if we had Ted Bundy as a guest.  Let's get some girls in here naked.  Come on.  Bring in the nude girls.  They could give them a laugh dance.  A waiting pool full of mud in a 12-year-old.  Ted, here.  Hold this blunt object.  Now bring in the girls.  They're all whores, aren't they, Ted? 
[07:23:30]  Come on in, ladies.  Yeah, these girls were bringing in their filthy whores, Ted.  Here's a bat.  We got Ted Bundy audio?  Yeah, that's when he's having sex with his girlfriend.  He's telling her to lay there and pretend she's dead.  What's that from?  The movie.  Oh, the movie.  Oh, the movie.  Which one was that?  Who played him in that one?  Mark Harmon.  Was it Mark Harmon?  Yeah, that was a good one.  I liked the Mark Harmon, Ted Bundy.  All right.  Why don't we play Craig Christ?  Or Ted Bungy, as Bernie would call him. 
[07:24:00]  Did he get one name right?  Al Bundy.  Martin Scorsese.  What did he say?  Rodgy.  That was my favorite one.  Rodgy Dangerfield.  Rodgy Dangerfield.  You're a very dangerous man.  Bernie Gates.  Rodgy.  He ran right over, pointing.  Oh, he was.  Oh, was he mad?  He was the irate white man.  He was fucking angry.  Michael Douglas falling down.  Right.  Just falling down.  That was it.  Bernie.  I'm like you, man. 
[07:24:30]  God damn.  I'm just like you.  That's every thug's worst nightmare.  It's some bespectacled guy with a pistol who gets mad that fucking quickly.  It looks like the mild-mannered Easy Mark, and he just loses his mind.  When he went out and grabbed his bag, his black bag, and put it up on the file cabinet,  I'm like, oh my God, here it comes.  Here it comes.  We're getting the best publicity we've ever had.  Frontier justice.  Frontier justice.  As much as I'd hate to see Opie get shot, what that would do for fucking gigs for the 
[07:25:00]  next year.  Oh, forget about it.  Every radio station in the country would want you on.  That would be huge.  If you pulled through.  His record isn't that good.  You know, he shot four guys, and none of them died, so you probably live.  So much for that vegetarian angle he has.  Yeah.  So much for the vegetarians making you mellow.  Jesus Christ.  I have another piece of broccoli, and I'll take some asparagus.  Put the CD in the fucking basket. 
[07:25:30]  Oh, yeah.  Enough about the friggin' soy milk and broccoli and soybeans.  Wow.  That was great that we really got to see him do his thing.  No one gives a shit about him running for office.  No.  We want to see you snap.  We want to see you snap.  And go into a murderous rage.  That's what we wanted to see.  That was it right there.  It took four hours.  Of course you wanted to see that.  Four hours of horrible news.  Four hours.  It took four or five appearances.  Yeah.  He's actually been on our show about four times, so it took that long to actually make 
[07:26:00]  him snap.  What's up?  Hey, Chris.  What's up, man?  Oh, hey.  What's going on, ONA?  Hey.  Hey, man.  The best part of that whole shit was as soon as you hear the CD break, you hear Bernie Gats  go, you motherfucker.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  You motherfucker.  He was pissed.  You can just hear him snappy.  Is there any way to pull that audio before the end of the show?  Yeah, definitely.  I want to hear him losing his mind.  I've got to hear him losing his mind.  We'll replay it after the break. 
[07:26:30]  Dave, what's up?  Yeah, I want to know what you think he would have actually have done if he actually had  gotten to Opie.  I don't know.  He probably would have hit him.  He probably would have hit him.  Yeah, I didn't want him to get to that point, so I used poor Eric as a blocker.  He would have hit you for disrespecting him.  I mean, he used lethal force last time.  Would he have, uh, took his thumbs into your eyeballs?  That guy would use the gun to drop him.  Oh, yeah.  I don't think he's...  He doesn't strike me as a grappler.  No, no, no.  Tommy.  Yeah.  Maybe a bitch slap.  I saw him walking down the street looking like a raving lunatic. 
[07:27:00]  He had a shovel and he was talking about Vermont.  I don't know what that meant.  That's where his gun's buried, by the way.  That's where he buried his gun.  All right.  Still there somewhere.  All right.  Well.  Whew.  All right.  We'll do, uh...  A lot of people are saying don't lose Bernie as a friend of the show.  No, we won't.  Uh, no.  He'll, he'll be back.  No one else is gonna let him talk for an hour about nothing, Horace.  No one who has advertisers to answer to would allow that nonsense.  Who can have these best bits?  Best Ramon promo. 
[07:27:30]  Ramon!  Ramon!  Ramon!  This sweeper has AIDS.  Number three.  State of the Union.  Gas prices going up again.  The Opiate Anthony Show on XM.  Oh!  Who goes the weasel?  Ramon!  Give me your sleeve. 
[07:28:00]  Voss takes a call on stage.  The guys find out that Voss actually stopped one of his acts to answer the phone.  So, of course, they had to confront him on this.  It's ONA's best bits.  Got an email here.  Hey, guys.  Just got in from the, um, anysoldier.usbenefitshow at the Stress Factory.  Uh, tonight's starring little Jimmy Norton and Rich Voss.  Norton killed as usual, but that's besides the point.  Effing Voss.  He's so whipped, he took a call from Bonnie in the middle of his act.  It went something like this.  During his act, he checked his phone once, and as a cover, he had to make a little hacky 
[07:28:30]  cell phone joke, so he says, fucking sprint.  They call it that because you have to run to find service.  Waka waka.  Ah, there you go.  A little while later, someone yelled out, how's Bonnie?  She's okay.  She'll be here later.  Wait, who said that?  Why am I answering you?  Who's Bonnie?  Near the end of his set, he couldn't grab the phone hanging from his pocket and get it  to his ear fast enough.  Where are you?  You're in New Brunswick?  No, I'm not bombing.  You're at the train station?  Turns to the crowd and says, how far is the train station from here? 
[07:29:00]  Yeah.  So then the people in the front row were all trying to give him directions for Bonnie.  It was a giant clusterfuck as people were naming the wrong streets and turns, and Bonnie  would have ended up a statistic in the paper.  So some dude from the crowd had to get up, go to the train station, and escort her to  the club.  Are you kidding me?  How effing whipped do you have to be to take a call in the middle of your set from your  chick?  Anyway, just wanted to share that with you guys.  Aside from that dignity-destroying moment, he had a great set as well. 
[07:29:30]  Maybe you could get him on the phone today and see how he defends himself.  This is from Lauren.  Did you see this last night?  No, I decided I wanted to be responsible and come home and sleep.  Oh, so you did your set and left?  Had my car jump-started for the second time that night because the battery is dead, and  then I drove home and backed in, and the stupid PR who works at my thing doesn't understand  English.  So I'm like, look, just leave it running until you back it in.  Oh, no.  He's like, why are you going to leave me?  Why are you going to leave me?  So I had to stay in the garage while this little failure backs my car in, and then I 
[07:30:00]  went upstairs and tossed and turned and dreamed of Black Sabbath at my birthday party.  Yeah.  Like a faggot.  That's cute.  Were you wearing a little party hat?  It was awful.  Happy birthday, Jim.  Where's the band?  They left.  Maybe I can dream next time that's my birthday and I'm kneeling in a bathroom and you put  your swamp ass in my face.  All right.  Well, we got Rich Voss on the phone.  Rich.  What's going on?  Hey, Rich.  What happened last night, buddy?  First of all, Norton goes on.  He kills.  Right.  He just destroys.  And he does it all the time.  He's such a weasel. 
[07:30:30]  Yeah.  Whenever, oh, I got to go on in the middle because I got to get back home, you know?  Never.  Like the extra half an hour is going to kill him, you know?  I always close those shows.  It takes a prime.  Deep prime.  I mean, he kills.  He's funny.  He's got a lot of funny stuff.  Don't talk about me like I'm not here, stupid.  I'm right here.  All right.  And the only thing worse than your cell count is your battery.  So, okay, 0 for 1.  Well, but I don't always go on in the middle.  I just, I actually, I had a legitimate reason last night.  We did a fundraiser at the Stress Factory a couple months ago for Levy, Bob Levy. 
[07:31:00]  Yeah, you know what, and I went on.  Shut up and shut up and listen.  One of our B comic friends, his wife is leaving him because he brings girls on stage and eats  whipped cream out of their asses.  Wait, who does that?  Bob Levy.  Bob Levy.  Oh, my God.  He brings girls on stage and eats whipped cream.  Blue cheese.  Oh, blue cheese.  And his wife is divorcing him, and he can't imagine why.  That's going to be fun in court when that comes up.  I know.  No pictures, right?  So, we do a fundraiser, and Levy goes on, and he kills, but he's filthy.  And Norris is like, I don't want to go on after him. 
[07:31:30]  Can you follow him?  Yeah.  And I'll go, okay.  You know, he's too dirty.  And Norris...  I didn't say he was too dirty.  No, I didn't.  What would you say?  I never could follow Levy historically in my career.  He's the one guy I was always...  I never wanted to go on after.  Well, you know what?  To get over your fears, you have to do things like that.  Well, sorry, I can't host every show like you do.  I'll host.  What are you, fucking Bob Eubanks?  Every show you do, you want to host.  You're right.  I want to host because I know how to...  Shut up.  Shut up, stupid.  So last time he goes on, and he destroys. 
[07:32:00]  It's this really funny fluid comedy.  A lot of stuff about his fluids and different diseases.  Sure.  Destroys, right?  So I go on after him.  Sure.  Right?  And, you know, I do an hour.  No problem.  You know, you can follow him.  You can follow that kind of humor.  You just do stuff with punchlines and stuff, right?  Yeah.  So, uh, where are you from?  Yeah, I didn't work around all day.  Stuff with punchlines.  What are you drinking?  So during this...  Well, Rich, I'm not to interrupt you, but I'm sorry I had to get out of there. 
[07:32:30]  But I was running late.  My cell phone wasn't working, so I had to sprint for service.  Or did you have to check your RSVP list to see if Black Sabbath is coming to the party?  That's a true story.  I had a little dream.  Yeah, you had a little dream.  Black Sabbath must have been really upset that they were all wet on in the face.  I can see upset little Jimmy in his dream that Black Sabbath wasn't at his party.  They were at the party.  I didn't think he threw me a party.  Yeah.  And there was a special treat, and then Sabbath left.  Did you tell me how to leave the party early because you had to get up for work? 
[07:33:00]  Sorry.  Anyhow, so...  I don't like the fact that you almost named somebody in Sabbath and realized you couldn't.  I know.  I forgot the guy's name.  Sorry, guitar player.  I can't believe you grabbed that one.  Wow.  So I'm on stage, you know, and I get up on...  Now, my girlfriend is coming from New York on a train, which she's never done.  Okay, she's from Canada. 
[07:33:30]  And she was coming from New York from her Letterman audition when she got the show.  And, you know, I never took the train from New York to New Brunswick either.  So, you know, I get a call on stage, and I kind of thought it might be her.  You know, New Brunswick is in a place you want some little white girl walking around.  And she got off the train, and I said, where are you?  You know, I was wondering.  Look, I was already at 50-something. 
[07:34:00]  This was during your act, though.  I don't really have an act.  Thank God he's finally admitting it.  Okay.  You know, this was right before, you know, I was going to say, you know, you can get my new DVD to the audience.  You got a new DVD at richfoss.com?  Yeah, it's just, yeah.  And I guess the first people I thank on the DVD is my good friends, Opie and Anthony, who, you know, I don't call in the morning just to thrash them and trash them because their girl calls them. 
[07:34:30]  So she called, and I said, you know, I tried to get her directions, and people got up from, you know, the audience and started walking out to go find her.  Not to help me because she's hot, you know, and they told me they have a shot in three blocks.  So, you know, one guy goes out, and then she tells me some guy comes up and goes, I'm a cop.  You know, he shows his badge, and, you know, and they walk her over to the, and the sprint joke is not a hacky joke.  That's a funny joke.  I didn't say it was hacky.  I don't know, whoever called in or wrote in, you know. 
[07:35:00]  But now we're getting a lot of people that's saying you're kind of pussy whipped now with Bonnie.  Well.  Do you blame him?  Jesus.  Well, but what's the, you know, what do you mean?  You know, finally a guy, you know, a guy is happy with, you know, this time with a girl.  And, you know, you know, it's not like I, you know, yeah, I don't know if that's what you would call it.  I'm, you know, I'm a good boyfriend.  You're not a, you're not a good, you're not a good boyfriend or a good friend.  You're not a good anything.  You're a creep. 
[07:35:30]  Although, I'm kind of caught in the middle.  As one of Voss's best friends, I'm kind of caught in the middle between being, because she is really hot and they get along great.  And look, they're a good couple.  But I'm caught in between being happy for him and wanting to smash his face.  Yeah.  When we're going to Albany, the phone keeps ringing because they're in love.  It keeps ringing and he keeps answering.  I'm like, could you be a fucking guy for once?  He would just answer the phone every time.  I'm in the middle of telling a great Hummer story and how the guy reacted when I gave it.  As we're driving to Albany, he goes, can you be a guy and pull into this rest area? 
[07:36:00]  Here's the thing.  Oh, hold on.  Hold on.  Hi, poopsie.  Yes, Snookums.  No, just driving with Jimmy.  Okay.  No.  I love you, too.  Oh, hold on, Jim.  Hold on.  We're at mile marker five.  Hi, Snookums.  But, Rich, the problem is...  Wubby, wubby, wubby, you, too. 
[07:36:30]  I just realized that my relative is really, really sick.  Hold that thought, Jim.  Hold that thought.  Good improv skills.  I say my relative.  Could I have picked one?  My relative.  Well, really concerned.  One of my ancestors.  They stink.  My kin is ill. 
[07:37:00]  Yes, Snookums.  Wow.  Richie, love you, too.  Richie, biggie, love you, too.  Hey, Jim, remember the time I was getting a blowjob and you were dogging that chick in the...  Oh, hold on, hold on.  No, lover.  You're the only one in my life.  My forever girl. 
[07:37:30]  You're my forever girl.  You complete me.  Oh, Jim, you're getting pulled over.  This is a good opportunity for me to take this call.  Oh, I understand why you do it, Jim.  Why you do it, Voss.  She's a very attractive, very nice girl, and I don't even understand for a second why she's 
[07:38:00]  with you.  I just don't get it.  That's why he answers the phone.  He's afraid if he doesn't answer, something's going to happen where she realizes what an ass  she's dating, like the phone's ringing for her, and she's like, why am I even with this  guy?  Like, he's got to distract her right away.  Oh, let me get that immediately.  He doesn't even let the ring finish.  Oh, hold on again.  Hello.  Oh, honey. 
[07:38:30]  Is that you, darling?  Yes, baby.  Oh, baby.  Oh, honey.  Oh, man.  Is that you?  Don't hang up.  I'm here.  You know what the sad thing is? 
[07:39:00]  When it rings, her picture comes up.  I put that into my phone.  You're kidding.  I swear to God, her picture comes up.  It's the same ring right now that you're doing.  I'm getting really scared that she's really calling right now.  Oh, my God.  Hold on, guys.  Oh, that's great.  Oh, Voss, you rock.  You met her at the roast, right? 
[07:39:30]  We met her at the roast, and she's a lovely girl.  And she's funny, too.  And, you know, what are the odds?  Listen, Norton's my best friend.  When me and her have sex, I definitely think of Norton's tits, right?  Voss, let me tell you something about Bonnie.  We felt guilty.  We talked about the roast the next day.  Ann and I were just looking at her boobs the whole time.  And we felt kind of creepy, you know, because it's your chick and stuff.  It's your chick.  But they were, like, falling out of that dress, and she's sexy to be very low-cut. 
[07:40:00]  What, you don't think I dropped a couple loads on my chest thinking of your girlfriend?  And then I'm thinking, you know, God, she definitely saw me looking at her boobs.  I couldn't help it.  Really?  Oh, my God, dude, she was just so hot at that thing.  Jeez, Opie, relax.  She was so ridiculously hot.  Opie just had his head in his hands going, oh, my God.  It was just like, wow.  Well, maybe you can get some his and her rollerblades and take her to Central Park.  Yeah, baby.  Don't listen to what Opie has done that. 
[07:40:30]  But I did feel like we felt like creeps.  Ann and I discussed it.  We were like, we were walking back to, you know, like 57th Street talking about your chick's boobs, man.  Well, you had to look at something.  You couldn't see the stage from those awful seats we got.  Oh, God.  The seats that Voss got us for that roast?  Yeah, thanks, Voss.  I'm surprised you didn't take pictures of them, Norton.  I did.  I got a celebrity seat.  I got pictures of how far away we were, actually.  Yeah, I got that.  I got that picture, too.  We should put it up on opiananthony.com. 
[07:41:00]  All right, I got it with me.  It was the Donald Trump roast that we went to.  And our seats were...  We were special guests of Rich Voss.  Yeah, and as we were going, we just had to keep walking upstairs.  Like, no one else had to go upstairs.  They were all on the floor.  There were literally like 10 tables upstairs in the balcony.  No, but here's the deal.  You didn't have to be stuck amongst all those stuffy people down there.  Oh, right, and who were actually seeing the roast.  Yeah, who were we with the party people upstairs who were looking at the monitors?  God forbid we're actually in the building. 
[07:41:30]  If you would have had quarters, you could have looked through one of those big viewfinders  and saw the stage from where you were.  It could have been a Bill Cosby roast from where we were.  I had no clue.  Donald Trump?  What?  Who was that?  I wanted to hug Robert Klein.  Thank God I had enough quarters to put in the viewfinders so I could see the stage.  That's what I just said.  I know.  Thank you.  Well, okay, so I have every now and then a bad one.  Here's the deal.  Well, you know, you're throwing nothing against the wall of six.  Here's the deal.  Those, first of all, those.  Hold on, I got a call. 
[07:42:00]  I got a call.  What do you call it?  Do you know what those seeds cost at that roast?  Do you know what?  You know what?  Who's the first people I said to get into the roast?  My pal Norton, my pal Zobin Anthony, and I'll throw my family in.  I cut my sister loose to get you guys in.  Really?  Thank you.  She bothers me anyhow.  It was a lot of fun.  All right, Foss.  It was all right.  All right.  I got to get back up to bed.  She's calling me.  All right.  Why don't you go back to bed?  This was a very successful call. 
[07:42:30]  Hey, do you guys want to have sex live on the show today?  What's that?  Do you want to have sex live on the show today?  Oh, it takes me an hour for the pill to kick in.  Leave with that one.  Leave with that one.  Just walk away.  Just walk away, sir.  We'll do that one day.  Really?  I will.  Of course I will.  He will.  I will.  Dude, you talk to her right now and make this happen, because it'll be the funniest thing  I ever hear. 
[07:43:00]  Are you serious?  Yeah, it's satellite radio.  We got a couple from California.  They're going to have sex next in a few minutes here.  Are you serious?  Yeah.  Oh, Jesus.  It could be really funny.  Would she be up for it?  I doubt it.  I mean, I would be, and I could fake it.  Of course you would be.  Can I just jack off on your show?  She's not into it.  You could just watch her and whack off live on the show.  That could be funny, too.  Oh, God.  Standing by the foot of the bed, just jacking it. 
[07:43:30]  Whispering so it's not to wake her.  Roll off.  Roll over.  Oh, Jesus.  Shred and Reagan are calling soon.  They're good guys.  Hey, are you playing a bowling alley in Suffolk County next week?  Is that where I'm at?  Oh, hold on.  My phone's ringing.  I don't know where I'm at.  I don't know.  If they pay me my money, I'm there.  Can someone pick up my girl?  All right, Bob.  All right. 
[07:44:00]  I'll talk to you guys.  If you want to call back and have sex, you know, do that, all right?  Put the producer on the phone.  The producer?  His name's Ben, you ass.  Oh, no.  Who else called me?  You Hollywood ass.  Who else called me?  Huh?  Somebody else called me.  Was that Ben?  It was Eric.  Oh, it was probably Eric.  It was Eric.  Yeah.  Know the players, bro.  You've been a friend for years.  I know.  I don't know the new guy.  Put the producer on the phone.  You don't know the new guy.  I don't know the new guy.  Eric's cool.  It's Eric, Ben, and Steve.  Can I speak to Rick?  All right, Voss.  All right.  See you, Rich.  Very good. 
[07:44:30]  It is, Rich.  Very good phone call from Rich Voss.  That was funny.  That was fun.  It's O.P.  It's O.P.  And Anthony's best sandwiches.  I mean, bits.  Best bits ever.  It's O.P.  And Anthony's best bits ever.  There's more of it, so don't go and play any games.  I'm not allowed to be a liar.  XM Satellite Radio presents Left Jab with Mark Walsh and David Goodfriend.  Molly.

[07:47:00]  Real funny stuff.  And it reminds me of the time I was running around my house with the mayonnaise underwear on and I had my roommate try to lick it off.  Enjoy.  A lot of Christmas parties this time of year and a lot of the companies warn their employees about sexual harassment.  Yes, they do.  A lot of that happens around the holidays.  As a matter of fact, I read an article recently about England.  In England, some company was putting out a whole thing on Christmas party etiquette.  What not to do.  And they had to write things down like no grabbing women's tits. 
[07:47:30]  I mean, if you have to write that down.  Like people are just going around, jolly good.  Hi, bird.  And then another one was no copying your posterior or genitalia on the copy machine.  Doesn't that seem like a Christmas party thing to do, though?  Little lights passing over those small, pale English genitals.  But is anybody looking at that going, oh, we can't do that?  I thought a good uncircumcised picture of my rotten little colonizing dick. 
[07:48:00]  I thought you'd like my imperialist war-making cock.  I love the British.  They've done nothing but to rule the world for the last 200 years.  Can't tell if it's an ugly English vag or their gums.  Their scurvy gums.  A spot of tea, then.  Meh.  Sexual harassment audio, Anthony.  A lot of people have to go through this.  It's a big thing when you get a new job at a big company. 
[07:48:30]  One day, they set aside and you have to go and sit and listen to lectures and watch films.  And it teaches you how not to get into trouble with sexual harassment in the workplace.  Let's go to the audio.  You hear about sexual harassment on TV.  And it makes the headlines in newspapers.  As an employee, what do you need to know about it?  First, sexual harassment is against the law. 
[07:49:00]  And it's against your company's policy.  So, what is sexual harassment?  Linda, you are doing a fine job here.  Oh, well, thank you, Steve.  But, you know, you might try dressing a little sexier at work.  I'm sorry?  I mean, we're talking about your job here.  There may be physical harassment.  Wow.  You're really tense today, Nancy.  Ow.  Bill.  Sorry. 
[07:49:30]  You looked really tense.  You know, I really don't like it when you do that.  Can you please stop?  I'll never stop, Nancy.  Never.  In some instances, the harassment may be verbal.  Word around the office is you've got a fat cock.  Yes, I do.  I've got a fat cock, too.  Maybe we should rub our fat cocks together sometime.  Maybe a little oil. 
[07:50:00]  Two fat cocks.  Together.  Oil.  It might be visual harassment, such as derogatory posters, cartoons, or drawings.  Sexual harassment is not always about sex.  It may be the result of a power struggle between a manager and a subordinate.  Man.  I could go for a power fuck right now.  Change is slow, and what was acceptable in common behavior years ago can now be sexual harassment. 
[07:50:30]  Smells like vagina in here.  Excuse me?  Smells like fresh vagina in here.  Are you talking about my vagina?  Maybe.  Everyone wants to be treated fairly and with respect.  Treat your co-workers with the courtesy and respect that you want for yourself.  It's your company's policy, and it's the law. 
[07:51:00]  There you go.  Why are you laughing at it?  I think we taught some people something there.  Yeah, it's a public service announcement for our listeners, you know.  This tape came right from Washington, from Lawyer Lady.  This is what they're playing down there in Washington at the XM Satellite Radio facility, Anthony.  Of course.  They take sexual harassment very seriously.  Yes, they do.  Oh, you could tell just by listening to that.  A fat cock.  One guy around the office has a fat cock.  I can think of someone from Sirius that can't wait to get a new job here. 
[07:51:30]  All right.  Relax.  Wow.  Let it go.  So you lost $50,000.  It's no big deal.  I know you've got a fat cock.  Jesus.  He can hold a grudge, can't he?  Mm-hmm.  And a fat cock.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Hi, it's Travis, and this is the infamous poker chip bit.  This is a girl and a guy, I believe, came down from New England to deliver the lesbian couch  and brought some poker chips along.  And Opie decided to, I don't want to ruin it, don't. 
[07:52:00]  Probably one of the most uncomfortable moments ever on the program.  And funniest.  And funniest.  Absolutely.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  Norton was just lying on the lesbian couch.  It stinks, huh?  It's fine.  It smells moldy.  I'm just tired.  I don't care.  All right.  Well, I like the lesbian couch.  Thumbs up to the lesbian couch.  It'll smell like... 
[07:52:30]  It has only one splooge stain, so that's good.  That'll change up.  Were you trying to give her a thumbs up through the window?  How revolting was that?  Thumbs up.  And she did...  I'm with you.  She's just staring into space.  She's not even looking at you.  No.  I'm not trying to make up for smashing her gift.  I just kind of tossed it to the side, and then it's shattered.  I don't know.  It's ceramic, and you broke it on purpose, and you giggled.  You're an awful person.  All right, well...  Your aunt's doing nothing but trashing those awful 1951 poker chips.  Yeah, see, that's the difference, though, man.  What?  Why don't you say what you were saying during the commercial break?  I said... 
[07:53:00]  How much I hate your poker chips.  I said...  And wish I had balls like me.  That these days...  Those chips stink.  Nowadays, you can get chips out of the same chips you play with in Vegas.  You know who uses chips like that?  Third graders.  Yeah, these chips are...  They need a little weight.  They don't have any weight to them.  Right, they need some weight.  These are the plastic chips you used to play with with, like, your junior high buddies.  They're awful.  You'd steal them from your parents and play poker.  They are awful plastic chips.  Give her the chips back.  Yeah, you gotta give them back. 
[07:53:30]  Just tell her you don't want them.  You might have to, man.  Oh, Bray's a good point.  Tell her you don't want her stupid chips.  Why do I have to be part of your rudeness?  Because you're, like, all brave when we're in commercial break.  But I can understand, you know, that something might suck and I might hate it, but I'm not gonna...  And, Norton, what about you?  These gifts stink.  They do stink.  I don't want to be known as the bad guy today.  The little chips.  A hat box.  The Lucille Ball hat box she bought when she was out with Viv. 
[07:54:00]  She got that from a garage sale.  That little stupid hat in the box.  Yeah.  Now, take it back, Lucy.  Now, Anthony, that's what it looks like.  Call her back in here.  But I understand I can get a bad gift and still be nice and not hurt people's feelings.  Call her back in here and give her her gift back.  Why do I have to hurt someone's feelings?  I will not bow to peer pressure and hurt someone's feelings.  Call her out on her gift.  I will tell her her gift sucks, but I will keep it.  Oh, you will, huh?  Just give it back.  Yeah, let's see Anthony say that.  You're really not coming back in here.  Are you insane?  Hi, Erica. 
[07:54:30]  I just wanted to say, Opie had a little mishandling of your gift.  He bobbled it a little while he was trying to put it over by his stuff, and it broke.  But I have the cards and chips, and thank you.  You guys...  I know.  I know.  Tell her.  Throw them out.  You hate them.  I don't care.  Tell her.  Don't bother me.  What?  Are those good chips?  I'm not saying that they're bad chips.  Are they good chips?  No, they're old.  They're probably from the 70s.  I just grabbed them.  70s Earth Mama chips. 
[07:55:00]  70s Earth Mama Muff chips.  Roll them away.  It would have been cool if it came from Frank Sinatra's house, but obviously it didn't.  You know, they could be worth money.  You don't know.  I don't know.  Well, if they weren't money, you'd be getting married.  What's wrong with that?  That's a genuine wood chip holder, isn't it?  Hey, give me those chips.  I guess that's one for my face, Steve.  No, look.  Give her...  Give Opie the chips.  Look, I'm just thinking I like them.  I really do, but I'm thinking maybe somebody else could use them more than I could. 
[07:55:30]  I'd be more than happy to take them and throw them in the trash for you, Anthony.  I'm not going to throw them in the trash, but perhaps somebody could use them more.  Tell her.  I'll take them back, Anthony.  Just give them to me.  Tell her.  She's yelling.  Tell her.  I'm trying to be nice.  What do you mean someone...  Why am I being yelled at?  You play Texas Hold'em.  Why can't you use those?  Well, they're just not quite the type of equipment I like playing with.  What kind do you like playing with?  They're chips and cards.  Well, different cards and different chips.  People play with different types of things. 
[07:56:00]  Yes, sir.  I'll pass it back to Steve.  Just give her the chips.  Just give those to her.  It's heavy.  Yeah, these are the cards that are still...  There you go.  They're all wrapped up.  See?  They're still wrapped.  They're all wrapped up.  You ever play 52-card pick-up?  Oh, gee.  Opie.  There's no reason I eat the cards at her.  Did the cards hit you?  Did they?  Opie, that cards fall off her sleeve.  Come on.  No.  Oh, God damn it. 
[07:56:30]  Oh, my God.  Opie.  Opie.  Holy shit.  Opie.  Don't, video tape.  Oh, boy.  Now clean it up.  Are you happy now, Opie?  Are you happy? 
[07:57:00]  I am mortified.  Oh, Eric called.  She spilled my chips.  I'm not mortified.  I knew you'd do stuff like this.  You're a thing.  She spilled my chips.  You're guinea brat.  Now clean it up.  That's right.  Be a poker player, just like your father.  Oh, my God.  I'm mortified.  I apologize for the other half of this program. 
[07:57:30]  Don't apologize.  I don't really care.  That is uncalled for.  That was uncalled for.  I hope you got a good laugh.  I hope you got a good laugh.  God, he's still immersed in it.  It's fine.  He can laugh.  I can't even talk to you.  That is horrible, man.  I knew from the start it was a bad idea to bring those in on the first place. 
[07:58:00]  I should have just brought the couch and be done with it.  That is horrible.  Well, look, I didn't have a problem with him or anything.  I hope for some reason, I don't understand why he's got to be like that.  Oh, my God.  It hurts.  I apologize for the actions of some of the people on this program, you know. 
[07:58:30]  Enjoy picking up your poker chips.  Thank you.  You guys can finish your show and talk about me and do whatever you want.  Find it out.  All right.  There she goes.  Wait, wait.  She's walking away.  Wait, can you take these?  Oh, look.  She's getting her stuff.  She's not even going to sit back down.  She's getting her stuff.  Oh, my God.  There she goes. 
[07:59:00]  Ben, go smooth things over.  Ben, smooth things over a little bit.  Remember when Rick had to smooth things over?  Guess what?  Now she's our fucking job.  You wanted to be the big dog.  Go ahead.  There it is.  Yeah.  You're the big producer now.  Go fix that.  That is the biggest laugh I've had on the show.  We broke it.  You fix it.  Because the way you threw them and rolled them across the console, it was a heavy thud and  they rolled and all just fell off.  And the chips were flying out and the chip carrier fell on her foot.  It was the most horrible thing I've ever seen one person do to another. 
[07:59:30]  That's the biggest laugh I've had on the show.  I couldn't breathe.  You are an awful person.  I literally could not breathe.  I was laughing so hard.  I don't know how you'd do that.  That just makes me so happy.  Those are things you think about doing sometimes, but no human does them.  But Opie, just stay.  I'll break your ball.  I'll throw the chips at you.  I'll fling the cards at your face.  These chips have coffee stains on them.  These are awful.  See, now you're brave.  I can't be brave with you.  Holy S. 
[08:00:00]  The back of my skull hurts.  I laugh so hard.  Eric from Jersey.  The sound of plastic chips raining to the floor is the saddest sound I've ever heard.  It will be like the sound of the thousands of tears she's going to shed in the car.  No.  Yeah.  Just walked outside with Ben.  Ben's talking to her right now.  Yeah.  Gave her a nice garbage bag full of O&A stuff.  She is bawling.  Oh my God.  See?  I knew it.  Here's what she said.  She goes, I don't mind if he broke it, but he threw it at me. 
[08:00:30]  Oh no.  And she turned her face into the wall near the elevator and that's all you're hearing.  Stop it.  You are horrible.  Cringe radio is back, boys and girls.  It's about effing time.  She threw the chips.  I didn't throw him at her.  Hold on a minute.  I think he's being smoothed over, though.  He actually didn't throw him at her.  I was a very good athlete when I was growing up and trust me, I didn't throw him at her.  Go fix that.  I made it very close. 
[08:01:00]  Go fix that.  Oh my God.  Oh, that's awful.  I cannot believe that.  I'm horrified.  All right.  Opie has no soul.  Evil to the core.  That's what they're writing.  And I wonder why I'm alone.  Opie is the effing antichrist.  And I wonder why I'm alone.  I go home alone every day and I wonder why. 
[08:01:30]  Why am I alone?  Jesus.  Can't figure that one out.  You made her cry.  I didn't want her to cry.  She was nice and she tried to be good natured about it.  I know.  She tried to take the ribbing.  It was the loud chips falling before the thing rolled off the console.  I know.  That was a big bet.  I'm all in.  I will splash the pot whenever the fuck I please. 
[08:02:00]  Dude, you've got to read some of the instant feedback.  This guy, Cody from Buffalo.  Opie put some good force into throwing those chips.  Sounds like some South American ring stick.  No, that's...  I was horrified during that whole thing.  An update?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Ben's calming her down.  Steve's out there.  They're, you know, getting her to breathe and calm down.  And they're going to try to see if she wants to come back in and get her picture.  Yeah, because she wanted pictures and stuff. 
[08:02:30]  Tell her if she cleans up.  Then you're brave without her in the studio.  That's the difference.  I admit it.  That's the difference between you and I.  Say that to her face.  I've done enough.  Haven't you done enough?  I think I've done enough.  I can't...  I don't know even...  What's going on out there?  It's just, it's not fun, Ope.  He threw it right at her.  I didn't throw it right at her.  Do we have the videotape?  You didn't get that on videotape? 
[08:03:00]  Yeah, I did.  You got that on videotape?  It kind of rolled on the console.  I kind of just rolled it at her.  Okay.  She had plenty of time to get out of the way.  Oh, she's a little upset.  Yeah, I would guess.  She drove all the way here from Rhode Island.  Just to give something to the show?  Yeah.  I want to get her photo.  Oh, my God.  She comes here to give something to the show and get a picture with Opie and Anthony.  Well, maybe she should have gave something to us from this decade.  What are you...  Who are you to say that our gifts aren't good enough? 
[08:03:30]  You know what?  He raised frankincense and myrrh not a good enough gift, Opie.  We're starting a rule on this show.  You bring gifts, don't get them from a garage sale.  That's all we ask.  You know, baby Jesus' best gift he got was a song from a little drummer boy, Opie.  That's right.  It had nothing to do with materialism.  It had nothing to do with the gold, frankincense, and myrrh might have been good gifts, but the  little drummer boy's song was the best gift of all.  And I'd have taken that over those last few tips. 
[08:04:00]  All right.  Let me see the video, Anthony.  All right.  Here's the video.  We're looking back at the tape.  She's all smiley.  Steve, I'll need a screening when you're done there.  Oh, my God.  Well, you kind of missed the toss, but you got the aftermath.  I wasn't really expecting you to do that, to be honest.  Oh, gee.  What did you think you were going to do?  Play a hand?  It's like catching a UFO.  You're just not expecting it.  Wow.  That's...  Well, look at Norton.  This is going to be great for foundrymusic.com.  I'm all in.  Show Anthony.  All right.  Bring that over here.  I got to see that. 
[08:04:30]  I think the audio will really help that clip because you were too close on her face,  but all you see is the chips go flying by her.  All right, well.  All right, let me get a look.  All right, there's Opie with the devious smile on his face.  She's talking.  Still, yes, smiling.  Oh, my God.  No, that's...  Oh, you see it clearly.  You see the chips flying by on the table.  Yes, Ben.  Not as if we've done enough damage to being in this new building already.  There's people just coming to work, getting off the elevator. 
[08:05:00]  Yeah.  You see this all going on in the hallway and are just mortified.  Oh, no.  Oh, they see her crying out front.  Him filming it.  Oh, no.  See that?  Yeah.  Not even trying to comfort her.  Could you face it this way when you break down emotionally?  Holy...  Oh, my God.  Oh.  I'm horrified.  I am horrified.  Yeah, I'm not going to fix this one.  See, this is the type of thing, the barrier that people say, you know, 
[08:05:30]  how far do you take things on satellite radio?  That's where, you know, I think the line should have been drawn somewhere.  Yeah.  The girl's just trying to bring some gifts to the show.  I definitely...  Give me those, I'll pass them to her.  She enjoyed...  What?  What?  Give me those, I'll pass them to her.  You're horrible, man.  That clip is hilarious.  You can see her face.  I mean, in the background, she sees the chips just flying by on the table.  Look at the construction workers looking at them like,  what the hell's going on in there? 
[08:06:00]  All right, well...  Should we take our last break and then regroup here, I guess?  I think, yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, that was great.  I, uh...  Why don't you go out and take your picture with her, Oaf?  Yeah.  The old fan from the AF days.  She's been a fan since the AF days.  Whatever.  The first time in ten years she's going to meet us.  Go buy Demento World and shut up.  No, she's, uh...  She's a nice lady.  Oaf and Anthony's Best Bits.  Best Drew Boogie Remix.  Ooh!  Number three.

[08:26:30]  Blending in there  Yeah  Wait, what?  Yeah  Exactly  Yeah  Alright, we'll figure that out  You know, this is a  New bit on the show  I think  Yeah, we need real karaoke versions  I think we need to give that  That mix to Bruce Kelly  For the 80s channel  Oh, yeah  Come on  Why not?  Know what the joke is here  By the way?  He's got to do a fast song  Yeah  He has too much time to  To what?  To know what's going on  Stammer  Yeah  What are some other songs  That we apparently

[08:28:00]  Running and running  Hey, hey  Skipping and a-jumping  In the misty morning fog  With hearts a-thumping  Girl  You might  Brown Eyed Girl  Happened 
[08:28:30]  Tuesday and so-so  Going down to the old mine  With a transistor radio  Standing in the sunlight  Standing in the sunlight  Left me  Behind a rainbow's wall  Slipping and a-sliding  Along the waterfall  Good girl  You might 
[08:29:00]  Brown Eyed Girl  Remember when we used to sing  Sha-la-la-la-la-la-la-la  La-la-la-la-la  Sha-la-la-la-la-la-la-la  La-la-la-la-la-la  Move, move, move  How'd you find my way 
[08:29:30]  Now that I'm on all my own  Saw you just the other day  My, have you grown  In my memory back there, Lord  Sometime I overcome thinking about you  You, my blind eye girl 
[08:30:00]  You, my blind eye girl  Remember when we sang  Sha la la la la la la la la la  Sha la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la 
[08:30:30]  I fucking suck! I fucking suck! I fucking suck! I fucking suck! I fucking suck! You don't suck! I fucking suck! 
[08:31:00]  Alright, calm down, Andrew. Jesus, it wasn't that bad.  Wait, why didn't you hear that? What did he say?  That was his inner voice there.  Well, that was nice. I liked the faster tempo there.  I liked it, too.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I liked a lot of times when you'd chop the unnecessary lyrics.  When you came in, it was, girl.  A little overrated, singing the whole song.  I liked the parts, actually, where he would sing the line before it even came out. 
[08:31:30]  Yeah.  Like, before you were actually able to...  You kind of got a little ahead of the lyrics.  Just a little bit.  Yeah.  That's good, though.  Alright.  Well, great job. Great appearance.  Great appearance, Andrew.  Excellent job.  Look forward to having you back again at some point on the program.  There's right now a van in Munaki headed towards a brick wall.  Yeah.  His last crash.  Eh, eh.  Eh, what are you going to do?  Eh, eh.  I think this is what we're going to do with Andrew next.  We're going to do movie scenes. 
[08:32:00]  Yeah.  We're going to, you know, team you up with, like, Stalker Patty.  Yeah, I need somebody for him to work again.  Or maybe Lady Di.  Lady Di.  Maybe, uh...  Marion.  Pat from Munaki.  Anyway, yeah.  The Lady Di.  Isn't that great?  Hey, how are you, Andrew?  Yeah.  But we'll do that next on the show.  Movie scenes.  Famous movie scenes done by these guys.  Alright.  Andrew, good job.  Excellent.  We'll see you soon, okay, buddy?  Opie and Anthony's best bits.  Best audio sent in by a listener.  Are you kidding me?  Ha ha, they all suck. 
[08:32:30]  Ah, right.  Manhattan Mimosa.  Is this thing on?  Number three.  Phenomenal.  Phenomenal.  Phenomenal.  Do you ever look back, and again, I know I do, when you look back on something you feel  great about, and then you look back on it, you go, ugh, what the fuck was I thinking? 
[08:33:00]  Yeah, I'm still doing that.  I'm still doing that.  I'm doing Sabbath stuff.  There's one song, uh...  Um...  Who are you?  Phenomenal.  Phenomenal.  Phenomenal.  And you know, there's always got to be one buzzkill in life, and I've got to just really  quick address the post.  A guy named Dan Aqualante.  I want to suck him up in his face.  He gave me trash to our Sabbath, where Ozzy created horror with his cringe-inducing vocals.  Ozzy sounded phenomenal. 
[08:33:30]  Phenomenal.  Phenomenal.  You're listening to O.P. and Anthony's Best Bits ever.  You heard this much, but there's a lot more.  So maybe you're hungry, and you want to have a sandwich.  That's alright, but you just need to make it very, very quick, so you can come back and  listen to O.P. and Anthony's Best Bits ever.

[08:36:00]  XM 202.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  This is funny.  This is when John Valby went downstairs and played the piano at the Steinway office.  The very fancy Steinway facility.  Yeah.  And it was a disruptive experience for all.  Especially when he said cunt.  Yes.  Hey, why is there a homeless guy walking around the XM Satellite Radio offices?  What are you talking about?  Hope, what's going on?  Oh, that's John Valby?  Is he drinking, too?  He brought booze with him. 
[08:36:30]  And the problem is he didn't bring his keyboard.  Are you kidding me?  I'm dead serious.  That's the whole reason he's here.  I know.  I told him right.  He brought his CD.  What the hell is that going to do?  He told me the other day he'd bring his keyboard.  And then he saw that we're in the Steinway building.  So he assumed we had a piano.  That's what he just told me.  But I think he's...  Can we go...  Because he performed last night.  We should go do a remote down with the piano.  I'm sure they'd love that.  Yeah, try to set that up.  Set up John Valby in front of one of those really nice Steinways. 
[08:37:00]  And see the horror on everyone's faces.  He performed last night in Jersey.  This show stinks.  We can't get anything going.  Why would we want John Valby on the air without his...  We can play his CDs.  Yeah, we could do that.  They're playing him when we go to breaks.  We need him in here with his keyboard.  What's he going to do?  Play a CD and then go, yeah, that's me?  Yeah.  You know what he told me?  He said he wants to sing acapella.  All right.  That could actually be funny.  Not known for his voice.  Ah! 
[08:37:30]  Ah!  He didn't bring a keyboard.  Forgot his keyboard.  Forgot his keyboard.  John's got the keyboard.  He just doesn't know where his van is.  He doesn't know where his van is?  No.  The best part about John Valby...  This guy's been around.  He's a legend.  He still drives...  He still drives his crappy van to all his gigs all across America.  If he can't find his van, how about this?  Check...  Look for bars and then look right in front of them.  For the vehicle parked to skew at the curb. 
[08:38:00]  He didn't bring the keyboard up because he couldn't carry it.  He brought the keyboard.  He just left it in the van.  What is he doing?  That bag is filled with booze.  Oh, he's looking for more booze.  And there's a van circling, but he doesn't have a cell phone to his driver.  So we're going to have to try to flag him down.  What does the van look like?  Maybe one of our listeners can help us get the van.  Yeah, it's a white Ford pickup.  A pickup?  White Ford van.  I'm sorry.  White Ford van.  There he is. 
[08:38:30]  John Valby holding up his Budweiser.  The king of beers, yes.  Budweiser.  The king of beers.  We're looking for his van.  We sent one of the interns out to try and find his van.  He doesn't have a cell phone that he could call his buddy?  No.  Oh, my God.  There he is.  John Valby, everybody.  With his Walt Disney Studios sweatshirt.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Mickey Mouse shirt under it.  He's got his...  And he's got his...  Jimmy Buffett hat on.  Jimmy Buffett hat. 
[08:39:00]  Yeah.  I gave up baseball hats about a half a year ago.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  All right.  40 years worth.  Hi.  How are you?  What's up, John?  Hey.  How you been?  It's been a while.  I've been excellent, man.  Good to see you guys back on the air or here.  You know, my FM radio still doesn't fucking work, though.  Well, it would be XM radio at this point.  Oh, XM.  Yeah, yeah.  So, you had a gig last night in Jersey?  Yes, I did.  Went well?  Went, yeah, sold out.  And I guarantee you haven't slept yet?  Actually, no.  I really did sleep.  I brought a beer just in case you wanted me to act like an asshole this morning. 
[08:39:30]  No, no.  No, no.  You can drink whatever you want.  We don't care.  I want to know, when you guys were off, what was your favorite place you went to?  Hmm.  Meatpacking District.  The Grand Canyon was cool.  Grand Canyon?  Opie went to the Grand Canyon.  Boy, this makes for great radio.  I went to the Grand Canyon.  Anthony, where did you go?  On my summer vacation.  I went to Atlantis in the Bahamas.  That was nice, too.  And I stayed there for a month.  Wow. 
[08:40:00]  Anything else you want to know, John?  Anything else that's going to make everybody turn off the radio?  Did you sample any of the local pussy down there?  The local pussy, no.  I can't say I sampled any of that, no.  Oh.  I had my girlfriend with me.  Oh, well.  It's kind of hard to sample the local pussy, as you so eloquently put it, John.  God bless you.  All right.  All right.  Well, what the fuck do you want to do here?  Well, you don't have your keyboard?  No.  What happened?  Are you just trying to call it in today?  You figure that we're all just good friends and that you don't need to perform anymore? 
[08:40:30]  Is this like that Jay Leno thing when you're a comedian and after a while, ah, I'm too good.  I don't need to perform anymore.  I'm just going to sit on the couch and talk to Jay.  Absolutely fucking not.  Here's the deal.  Uh-huh.  I could never play the real shit on the air, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Now, I got new CDs, two you've never heard, with good recordings of really great material.  Boom.  You can hear it with the crowd, the laughing, the whole thing.  So, we're going to do John Valby karaoke today?  Well, all right.  Can you at least make your mouth move and make believe you're singing? 
[08:41:00]  Dude, we want you to sing live in the studio.  Yeah, that's like part of the fun, is watching you perform it.  I have all your CDs and I love them, but we want a live performance.  Could you do maybe a cappella or something?  I could.  I wrote a song just for here.  It's like having Paris Hilton on the show and her not bringing her snatch.  Right?  You know?  If you want her to bring that along, it's what she's famous for.  Because there's nothing else to talk about.  Right.  Or her name is Paris Hilton.  Yeah.  And if you want to fuck her butt, go to her hotel, call room service, and ask them to 
[08:41:30]  send up a slut.  Ah, fuck.  How does the second half go?  See, now, if the music was going, you'd know what the next line is.  Yeah, I just can't fucking remember.  I can help you out with that.  Ah!  Ay-yi-yi-yi.  Jesus.  Your sister's bedroom has an on-deck circle.  How about your sister brings rubbers to family reunions? 
[08:42:00]  How about you have another beer?  Jesus.  How about your grandpa took a dump in the voting booth?  Do you guys do political crap here?  Oh, yes.  Oh, we had a very long political break yesterday.  We had Uncle Teddy on yesterday.  Ted Nugent.  Ted Nugent.  Oh, wow.  His right-wing Republican ideas.  Uh-huh.  How was it?  Fun?  A lot of fun, yeah.  Some of the listeners got very upset with him.  A lot more fun than this segment.  All right.  How about the Red Sox won the World Series?  The Yanks choked four in a row. 
[08:42:30]  I'm doing Opie and Anthony to cover my bets.  Next year, I think that I'll root for the Mets.  Who's your daddy now, asshole?  They reverse the curse of bad luck.  Now it's one, two, three cheers for the Sox because the Yankees suck.  Yeah.  You know, there's something about the piano that goes along with that stuff. 
[08:43:00]  Yeah.  All right.  I'll get the fuck out of here.  Oh, no.  We don't want that.  No, no.  I mean, no.  We just want a piano.  Yeah.  We don't want you to leave the studio.  Without a piano, it's just kind of like...  Hickory, dickory, duck.  This chick was sucking my cock.  Oh!  You know.  Without the piano.  Yeah.  We're a little boy fooling.  That's why you should play the CD.  All right.  You won't do it.  No, we can play the CD going into breaks and stuff.  You know, and you really don't have your piano. 
[08:43:30]  I cannot believe he doesn't have his keyboard.  You know, in New York City, there has to be 50,000 keyboards within a mile and a half of  right fucking here.  You cheap fucking cocksuckers.  I've never heard of...  Get a fucking keyboard.  All right.  Let's hear another...  We should have one on call.  Let's hear another a cappella song from John Valvey.  What else you got?  Same-sex marriage.  Same-sex marriage.  Bruce and Chauncey and a baby carriage.  Let me tell you, brother, the one with the sore ass is the mother. 
[08:44:00]  Callie and Rosie, Callie and Rosie, finger up her pussy, nice and cozy.  Let me tell you, sister, she still can't come until you fist her.  Bush and Carrie, Bush and Carrie, shouldn't have a say in who you marry. 
[08:44:30]  Tell you one thing for damn sure, tonight I'm marrying my hamster.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  Do-ba.  Yeah, there you go.  We'll give you a little clap for that one.  Hey, sorry guys.  I, you know, I thought we were in New York City.  We'd have fucking shit up here.  A keyboard.  Yeah.  You could usually just get a keyboard in New York City at six in the morning or seven or...  Hey, I figured this is...  Oh, Danny, the intern's on the line. 
[08:45:00]  This is XM fucking radio.  All right, hold on.  Danny's right.  We should.  Danny's on the line.  He's our intern.  We sent him out onto the streets of Manhattan to try to find your van.  Uh-huh.  Let's see if we got an update.  Hey, Danny, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hello, Danny.  Did you find the van?  Nah, dude.  I'm looking pretty hard.  I'm canvassing 57th Street right now between 6th and 7th, just on the lookout for a black  Ford van with New York Place.  I thought it was white.  Yeah, wasn't it a white van?  It's black now.  Oh, many years ago it was white.  It's a black van.  Okay.  Yeah.  And what's his name? 
[08:45:30]  He's driving that around right now?  Ronnie.  Ronnie?  Yeah.  So where did you tell him to drive?  Uh, I didn't tell him anything.  I'd tell you he's going to meet me at Shelly's at 830.  Well, Shelly's is right across the street.  Yeah.  Oh.  Where did he go for a half hour or an hour?  Find a whore?  Is he the kind of guy that might go down and try to find a tunnel bunny?  No, he's the same as you when you go to the Caribbean.  Oh, gotcha.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  All right.  Thank you, Danny. 
[08:46:00]  You got it, guys.  If you find the van, call us back.  Absolutely.  So he's going to be at Shelly's to pick you up at 830.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  See?  Mm-hmm.  You know?  Damn.  Fuck, you know?  Talk to Jim and fucking I'll come back in a few months.  Yeah.  All right.  How about one more a cappella song?  Oh, fuck.  And where's your CD?  We'll play some stuff going in a break.  Is this the latest CD?  One called The Old Fart Cuts Another One.  Okay.  And Operation Fuck Iraq.  Oh.  All right.  Which song should we play? 
[08:46:30]  Oh, fuck.  Do the second one.  I like the second one there.  They're all good.  What, Best Shot?  Yeah, Best Shot.  All right.  We'll play Best Shot going in a break.  All right.  These are your latest CDs.  I love the John Valby CDs.  I saw it.  Norton was playing Cleveland.  It just so happened the day before Valby was playing.  And Ronnie gave me literally, I don't know, you have like 50 CDs out.  Well, yeah.  It's unbelievable.  Yeah.  I got the whole catalog now, so.  So you could hear it with the music.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I feel really bad now, man.  That's all right.  He's kind of right. 
[08:47:00]  We should, you know, as a professional studio, have a guitar, have a keyboard, just in case people drop in.  Well, just in case people drop in, we do have the wiffle ball back and the drill, though.  I know.  We have a wiffle ball back and a drill, though.  And, John, we are looking for someone to break in the new wiffle ball back.  And that's your punishment, I think.  I saw that fucking drill, though, man.  That's awful.  Isn't that frightening?  Who would fucking do that?  I know.  Well, we've heard from people that use that.  Really?  Why don't we get drill, though, guy in?  The girls are getting ready.  And as we get the drill, though, guy in, maybe, John, you could do one more acapella for us. 
[08:47:30]  I think you have one more song in you.  Got one more?  I don't know what the fuck to do.  We could just imagine you're hearing a piano.  One of the newer songs.  One of the newer songs, something maybe that's topical.  Oh, I could do, oh, my name is Ronald Reagan.  At the end, my brain was mush.  But even then, I was twice as smart as George W. Bush.  Ooh, there you go.  Now, that may be sickening, but here's what's really scary.  George W. Bush is twice as smart as Carrie. 
[08:48:00]  Who gives a fuck?  You gotta do this with a crowd yelling and screaming.  Of course.  What's going on?  This is the worst.  Who gives a fuck?  This is the worst.  Fuck, I gotta get the fuck out of here.  This is John Valby crashing and burning.  I'm kidding.  This is probably your best appearance.  Oh, shit.  Oh, so funny.  We like crash and burn appearances.  Oh, man.  This is fucking painful here. 
[08:48:30]  You know, I hate fucking radio because I could never say what I really think and all that shit.  Yeah.  And then I finally get a place where I can speak as I am and fucking, it's fucking going in the tank  because I got no fucking piano in a fucking city of 50,000 motherfucking pianos within a mile and a half.  Son of a bitch.  Yeah, but they're owned by people.  Yeah.  Like we got, we're in the Steinway building.  There's a huge piano downstairs, but we're up here.  I know.  There's beautiful pianos down there, man.  Oh, fucking A.  And we can't hear them. 
[08:49:00]  Let's do it.  Like your short talk is cheap.  Let's go down there.  Knock on the fucking door.  Wait, are they open yet?  You should just walk in.  We bring like cell phones down there and you play your songs right there.  In the Steinway building.  Oh, wow.  That could be funny.  What time are they open?  I don't know.  They'd be blown away if they heard you really play because he can really play great.  Of course.  That's what you should do.  He's an amazing pianist.  Yes, yes.  You do one of your things there and then just when you get them all hooked in.  Roped in.  Roped in.  Then you could break out the songs. 
[08:49:30]  Break into gangbang or something.  Yeah, yeah.  You were talking about ringtones.  No, somebody was talking about ringtones.  Ringtones?  Yeah, you know those things they put on the fucking...  Yeah, we were talking about that, uh...  What?  What?  Uh-oh.  Dude, all you had to do was write me a note and I would have segged right into that.  Hey, how about those ringtones?  Instead of just pulling it out of the sky.  Yeah, we were talking about ringtones, actually.  It's not that I'm here deep in slumber. 
[08:50:00]  More like I'm cuffing the kinky cucumber.  So at the sound of the tone, grab your own bone and pump out your name and your number.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I left my messages on your mother's face.  I like that.  I like that.  I mean, for an actual ringtone of the little kids walking around, uh, quit beating your  bone and answer the phones at Barnacleville, the sailor.  You know, hey, fucking little ding, ding. 
[08:50:30]  I love to hear it as a fucking ballgame.  John, I love it.  Usually makes us laugh harder than anyone I've ever seen.  His shows are absolutely amazing.  Where are you playing next, John?  Uh, let's see, tonight, Long Island Governors and then, uh, Connecticut.  It's a B-Y-O-P.  Bring your own pussy.  Piano.  Oh, piano.  Yeah, you're going to bring a piano to your gig?  Yeah, fucking hey, I got two of them in the fucking truck.  All right, speaking of the truck, we got Danny, the intern.  Yes, Danny, we got an update on Velby's, um, uh, uh, uh, keyboard there. 
[08:51:00]  No, this is Eric, if you're looking for Danny.  All right, what's up, Eric?  I'm downstairs by Steinway.  There's people in here.  It looks like they're open.  Good.  Oh, all right.  Does it look like you'd be able to make a dash for the piano?  Um, the main piano in the room, it looks like they're tuning up, but there's a secondary  one that looks like we could probably take over if we ask them nicely.  All right, why don't you, uh, come up and get John Velby.  Let's see if we can get a, uh, song live from, uh, downstairs.  Live from the Steinway headquarters. 
[08:51:30]  Yeah, from Steinway headquarters.  All right?  Okay, I'm coming up.  All right, good.  All right, we're going to see if this, uh, this could happen.  Yeah, that'd be cool.  We can set this up.  Eric would go, it's, it's for the radio.  This guy plays really good.  Don't tell him who you are.  And then just, because I've, I, we've heard you jammed.  Just do one of your jams.  Okay.  And then when you're feeling it, just break into a, a gangbang or something.  Tell them you're Jonathan Velby.  Tell them you're Jonathan Velby.  Jonathan.  Yes.  Sebastian.  Yes.  Great.  All right.  Let's get to work on that.  This sounds like an adventure.  Yeah. 
[08:52:00]  And, uh, Bob Kelly's on the phone.  Bob?  Hey, what's happening, man?  What's up?  There's just a bunch of Mexicans in minivans down here.  There's no, uh, black Ford van.  Are you coming up?  Yeah, I'm downstairs right now.  Well, what are you, why aren't you coming up?  Oh, I'm just helping this little intern out.  He's running around like a fucking chicken with his head cut off, looking at every van  that drives by.  So I figured I'd help him out a little bit.  All right.  Stay down there, because we're bringing Velby down.  You can help us out with this bit.  All right.  All right?  All right.  All right, cool.  Bob Kelly's downstairs. 
[08:52:30]  John Velby's going downstairs to the Steinway facility.  Mm-hmm.  This place is absolutely beautiful.  Yeah, this is not a place for us.  Not that way.  It's very nice.  It's about time we got in trouble with the building, you know?  Yeah.  We've been too nice.  We've been here a month.  Why not?  And there, John Velby's staggering out of the studio.  Oh, jeez, you totally got him.  He is going to horrify people down there.  If they let him sit down and start playing, they're going to be all happy, because he's  very good.  And it's going to look all cool, because he's going to play a nice tune, I bet. 
[08:53:00]  And then when he breaks into his smut...  Jesus, that would be great.  That's going to be awesome, Steve.  Boy, he sure needs his piano.  Yeah.  When he starts singing that stuff without any music at all, whew.  That's bad.  Brutal.  Danny.  Eric, again.  Why do they keep saying Danny on the line?  Don't know.  Hey, could someone else call?  I want to get some stereo action down there.  Um, okay, let me get one of the interns off the street.  Oh, there might be...  Oh, never mind, Eric.  Yeah.  All right, so what's going on down there, first of all? 
[08:53:30]  Set this up for us.  Okay, we're in the middle of the Steinway showcase.  They gave him the big grand piano right here in the middle.  Do they know who he is?  Um, no idea, but they were just tuning the piano and then removed everything, so John sat down  and he's tickling the ivory.  That's John playing right now?  Yeah.  Let's listen to what he's playing.  Yeah.  Plays very well.  Yeah.  He's just warming up.  He's ready to go when you want him to.  All right.  Oh, my God.  Well, we've got to ask a few questions. 
[08:54:00]  How many people are in the Steinway facility there?  Uh, right now it's, um, John, myself, Bob Kelly's here.  All right.  And, uh, just the Steinway, uh, piano techs.  How many, uh, Steinway people are there?  Uh, one, two, three.  All right.  Three people that will be horrified in a matter of moments.  Yeah, the manager of the place is standing there with, like, his hands on his hips giving  me this dirty look.  Why?  Why?  I don't know.  He's just standing there.  The techs are explaining to him and he's looking at his watch.  Are they all, uh, I think we need to hurry and get this done and get out of here. 
[08:54:30]  You better make this quick, man.  Are they pleased with his playing?  The what?  Are they pleased with the way he plays?  Uh, the tech said he does very good.  They just haven't heard his lyrics yet.  No, right?  No, it's strange.  Uh, Valby looks like he's homeless.  He's drunk.  And I didn't want to say it in front of him, but he smells really bad.  I like booze.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, I noticed that, right?  Well, let's have him, let's have him play a song.  What song, uh, should we have him play?  Well, uh, uh, well, uh, uh, Eric?  Yes?  Have him really, because I don't think he knows he's on the air.  Have him jam one of his, uh, you know, legit things. 
[08:55:00]  Okay.  They might toss him soon, man.  First song you do, do something really legit just to...  Just for, as a quick warm-up.  Make sure he doesn't go too long.  Okay.  Little boogie boogie.  This is going to be great when Eric gets kicked out, because he will.  Oh, of course. 
[08:55:30]  This is where it's going to get really uncomfortable.  I was out on a date in my daddy's car.  I picked her up in a Manhattan bar.  I finger-fucked her clit.  She didn't let out of me.  I had my cock in her throat too.  I was humping her face.  My pecker started to spit.  The doctor said the bitch had an epileptic fist. 
[08:56:00]  Oh, where, oh, where can my pecker be?  The bitch bit in right off of me.  You're a man with two balls and a stump.  You better keep my pecker when you take your next dog.  Oh, that's great.  And there you have it.  The text is saying, we need to leave now. 
[08:56:30]  One more.  One more.  Can you do one more quick?  Just one more?  One more?  One quick one?  Can you just do one quick one?  Like a 30-second one?  30 seconds.  Okay.  Yeah, allow him to do one more.  All right.  All right, one more.  Okay, here we go.  Live from the Steinway facility.  Blowjobs and handjobs and eating clitoris.  Watching your grandmother douche with laboris.  Brown pubic cunt hairs and toilet bowl rings.  These are a few of my favorite things. 
[08:57:00]  Popping bum blisters at the balls of my ass fat.  Taking a shit in my New York Yankees hat.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Oh, that was great.  Oh, yeah.  I think he's done.  They're ganging up on us now.  They're clicking us out the door.  Okay, we're leaving.  Thank you very much.  Appreciate it.  Oh, Jesus.  Wow.  You guys have no idea how crazy that was. 
[08:57:30]  That is the classiest place downstairs.  It is like a social club's lounge area.  Okay, we're coming up right now.  All right.  Very good.  Thank you, Eric.  No problem.  Paul, you guys have no idea.  This is one of the classiest joints in all of Manhattan.  It's a real piano place.  They have these beautiful, beautiful Steinways all over the place.  It's a showroom of just beautiful Steinways, and he's in the middle singing that crap.  It's a landmark building in Manhattan, so that's a pretty special thing. 
[08:58:00]  It's a historic landmark.  That is, I would have loved to have seen their faces when he broke into that first tune.  God, was that funny, too.  Jesus.  See how much better it is with the piano?  Even over the phone.  Oh, my God.  Very good.  Wow.  He horrified me.  They're saying we have to leave.  They're saying we have to leave.  They're pushing us out right now.  Yeah, we'll hear about that one.  Yeah, we will.  We will so hear about that. 
[08:58:30]  Yeah, yeah.  All right.  The terror audio.  Oh, the terror audio, yeah.  That was terror audio.  Jesus.  I'm terrified.  All right, so it's the new terror tape.  Yeah.  He's an American, so it's not as scary.  And I think it kind of comes off like backyard wrestling.  The guy just doesn't strike the fear into people like the guy speaking that horrible, savage language does when they translate how they're going to kill us. 
[08:59:00]  When it's some dopey ass from California that didn't fit in.  A little misfit.  So it's not as scary.  What the hell is his name?  Adam something.  Adam Perlman is his last name or something?  Oh, I think it is something like that, yeah.  Sounds like a Jewish last name, although I don't know if it is.  Goldman or whatever.  Self-hating.  Of course.  Self-hating Jew.  Yeah.  And he's on America's most wanted list. 
[08:59:30]  Finally being somebody.  That's what it's about.  Yeah.  We've got to interrupt again, Anthony.  Bob Kelly's here.  Bob, what was going on down there?  Oh, the gay guy in the suit walked away as soon as he heard click chorus.  He just ran in the back room and the piano tuners were just cracking up.  It was hilarious.  John Valvey really looks like he could be like a classical player.  He's playing all the classical ones and then the guy in the suit heard click torus and ran away. 
[09:00:00]  How did it feel down there, John?  Actually, that was one of the best pianos I ever played in my life.  One of the two or three best.  Wow.  Phenomenal pianos.  Steinway, yeah.  Yeah, nice big echoey room, you know.  I have no idea what it sounded like.  It sounded great over the phone.  It must have sounded amazing down there.  I haven't laughed that hard in two years.  Right there.  Goddamn, very funny.  Very funny.  I fell over Ben.  We were rolling around the floor.  I couldn't control myself.  So, when those lyrics popped out, just knowing how classy that joint is.  Oh, it is. 
[09:00:30]  The tuner guy had no idea what he was singing.  And I was like, you like that one?  That was good, right?  He's like, oh, that's a good song.  Very good song.  I like that one.  Favorite show intro.  Hey, we don't all sound that dumb.  Number two.  In the wee hours of the morning, while the city sleeps, an uncommon band of heroes unites 
[09:01:00]  to fight the forces of evil.  The Obi and Anthony show.  Oh, my sweet.  Jeez.  With a cop.  I want to be known as Notorious.  No.  Act.  Everyone is always in my way.  Oh, you really are deluded.  And B-Cop.  Kind of fat-breasted and awful.  And surrounded by dullards.  That looks like curly-spliced gum.  Oh, it's hilarious.  Ever Steve yawns?  It looks like the back of the Batmobile and it looks like someone like this.  I do.  Oh, ketosis.  Eric, you're not going to cry.  Shut up. 
[09:01:30]  And armed with superhuman powers.  He pulls his pants down and just starts leaking into someone's garbage shed.  That's rule one.  How about if he gives you the old chin tap with his helmet?  That's all right with me.  They are living among us.  Average citizens.  Average heroes.  Quietly and anonymously continuing to make the world a better place.  Controversial talkers, Opie and Anthony.  We are just mixed.  You better just sit back and watch.  Yeah.  Wait, what?  The Opie and Anthony show. 
[09:02:00]  Oh.  It's Opie and Anthony's best sandwiches.  I mean, bits.  Best bits ever.  It's Opie and Anthony's best bits ever.  There's more of it.  So don't go and play any games.  I'm not allowed to be alive.  NHL game.  Play-by-play on XM.  The NHL in the midst of its two-day Christmas break.  So let's take a look back at some of the milestones of the past year.  Toronto goalie Ed Belfour recorded his 448th career win, 
[09:02:30]  giving him sole possession of second place on the all-time win list behind Patrick Waugh.  The Montreal Canadiens retired the number 12 worn by Dickie Moore and Yvonne Cornwaying.  Paul Coffey's number 7 was retired in Edmonton.  And former Bruins star Cam Neely was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame with Soviet star Valerie Harlemaugh.  And fear not, there are 12 games waiting for you on Monday.  Eight of them on your XM radio.  Among them, the Canadians and the Thrashers, the Devils and the Maple Leafs, and the Rangers and the Senators.  How about the Hurricanes and the Lightning, the Wild and the Oilers? 
[09:03:00]  Or maybe you'll want to catch the Coyotes and the Avalanche.  Two more on XM radio Monday night.  The Flames meet the Canucks, and the Sharks will battle the Kings,  and the World Junior Hockey Championship gets underway in Vancouver.  The NHL on XM, channels 204 through 209.  XM Satellite Radio presents Left Jab with Mark Walsh and David Goodfriend.  Molly.  From Take 5.  In our jab room versus broad-minded.  Psychological profile.  Yeah.

The O.P. and Anthony Show.  XM 202.  The O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[09:04:00]  Hey, it's E-Rock.  We're in the category of Best Overall Show Segment.  Coming in at number four is Cigarette Ads.  We found some old cigarette commercials that were sponsoring TV shows and cartoons like the Flintstones.  And we noticed that some of these ads here maybe were leaning towards a certain stereotype.  And Anthony took it from there.  It's O&A's Best Bits.  So, Anthony, we got the Flintstones talking about cigarettes.  Yeah.  We mentioned this earlier.  A little earlier.  The times they did a change.  They used to be able to have cigarette ads on television.  And even cartoon characters, which now you just, you can't have a cartoon character hawking anything now. 
[09:04:30]  Or else they say you're exploiting the children, harming the children.  But back in the old days, cigarettes.  What was this?  Winston, I think.  Winston.  Fred and Barney.  They sure work hard, don't they, Barney?  Yeah.  I hate to see them work so hard.  Yeah, me too.  And let's go around back when we can't see them.  Gee, we ought to do something, Fred. 
[09:05:00]  Okay.  How's about taking a nap?  Hey, I got a better idea.  Let's take a Winston break.  That's it.  Winston is the one filter cigarette that delivers flavor 20 times a pack.  Winston's got that filter blend.  Yeah, Fred.  Filter blend makes the big taste difference, and only Winston has it up front where it counts.  Here, ahead of the pure white filter,  Winston packs rich tobacco specially selected and specially processed for good flavor and filter smoking. 
[09:05:30]  Yeah, Barney, Winston tastes good like a cigarette chute.  Oh, man.  The Flintstones have been brought to you by Winston, America's best-selling, best-tasting filter cigarette.  Winston tastes good like a cigarette chute.  Wilma, Wilma, I've got to get to the rock quarry. 
[09:06:00]  They took my throat out.  I got throat cancer from Winston cigarettes.  Ah, Barney, Barney, could you, could you pedal the car with your feet today?  I'm weak from the chemo.  That cartoon's hawking butts.  They show Betty in one episode having to fill one side of the bra with tissue that she smoked for a long time.  Oh, my God.  Are you insane? 
[09:06:30]  I'm Betty.  Why I'm Betty?  Yeah.  Oh, we're going into silly zone again.  All right.  Well, there you go.  The Flintstones talking about cigarettes.  That's a little strange.  The voices were a little off, though, right?  Yeah, it almost sounded like fake Fred.  Hey, Barney.  Yeah, it sounded like Jackie Gleason.  Hmm.  Yeah.  Well, that cartoon was based on the Honeymoon.  Based on the Honeymoon.  Stolen from.  I hated the Flintstones.  Did you?  I loved it growing up. 
[09:07:00]  Jetsons, too.  Hated it.  I hated the Jetsons.  Loved the Flintstones, though.  God.  I don't like Bugs Bunny because there was a viciousness to it.  Bugs was great.  Probably the best cartoons ever made were the old Warner Brothers cartoons.  But now they cut out all the violence when you see...  Of course.  ...when you see Bugs Bunny now.  The whole...  All those cartoons were all about the violence.  It's all about smashing people on the heads with frying pans and shooting them in the face with shotguns.  And then they cut it to pieces now.  I'm the Easter Bunny.  Hooray. 
[09:07:30]  Smashing his face on the ground.  Oh.  I loved it.  I loved those cartoons.  Growing up, watched them all the time.  I can't believe you didn't like the whole nastiness.  Never liked them.  Bugs was just a nasty thing.  I liked Bugs Bunny.  Oh, you did?  No, I loved them.  I thought you said you didn't like Bugs Bunny.  No, I hate the Flintstones.  I like Bugs Bunny.  I'm so confused.  No, no.  Bugs Bunny was great, man.  That's why that's the best cartoon.  It is.  Uh-oh.  F-ing idiots.  Peter from WhackBag.com.  What cigarette did Opie smoke? 
[09:08:00]  Chesterfields?  No, he kicked that habit.  Right in the liver.  A lot of rumors flying around.  Yeah.  As far as this show goes.  I don't know why.  What are you giving me, Eric?  People love Lost in Space.  Oh, okay.  I see.  All right.  Thank you.  What did you give Opie?  Just cartoon theme songs.  Oh, what is it?  What are you drinking, Ben?  A little water?  Can we get more coffee?  I'm fading.  Go on.  Yeah, then turn.  Opie wants coffee.  Let's go.  Coffee. 
[09:08:30]  Coffee.  All right.  Well, we have the Winston commercials, too.  You want to try a couple of these?  Yeah, let's hear some of these olden day commercials.  Oh, no.  This is for Newport.  Newport.  Yo, B.  I loves the Newport.  Hey!  Groovy.  Just give me a coffee, please.  Newport tastes fresher.  Tastes better, too. 
[09:09:00]  I ain't that great.  Newport tastes fresher.  Tastes better, too.  Let's just conjure up images of walking into the Copa.  Tastes better, too.  Smoking cigarettes and drinking.  Than any other mental cigarette.  Walking through the back of the Copa.  Walk through the back.  I think that's about it.  All up front.  I think that's about it.  It's just a jingle.  That one's great.  That music's great, ain't it?  And then this one's for Lucky Strike.  Old cigarette ads. 
[09:09:30]  Lucky Strike.  First again with Tobacco Men.  First again with Tobacco Men.  What?  Lucky Strike means fine tobacco.  Lucky Strike means fine tobacco. 
[09:10:00]  Yes.  In a cigarette, it's the tobacco that counts.  And Lucky Strike means fine tobacco.  Yes.  So round.  Yes.  So round.  So firm.  So fully packed.  Yes.  So free and easy on the draw.  So for your own real deep down smoking enjoyment, smoke that smoke of fine tobacco, Lucky Strike.  And remember, collards, use your own water fountain. 
[09:10:30]  Don't these just all sound?  Yes.  Lucky Strike.  Smoke them without Negroes around.  Oh.  After you've run the fire hose on black people, enjoy the draw of a nice Lucky Strike.  Yes.  Lucky Cigarettes.  To be enjoyed without the pain and agony of having black people around.  You could walk into a diner that doesn't serve Negroes and light up a Lucky Strike. 
[09:11:00]  So after you go home and beat your wife, draw on a nice Lucky Strike.  You'll be lucky there are no Negroes in your neighborhood.  Because you're white and live in America.  And you're free not to live near black people.  And smoke Lucky Strike cigarettes.  Ah, the good old days.  That's wonderful. 
[09:11:30]  What do you call a black guy that's smoking a cigarette?  Um.  Um.  See, you laughed.  I wanted to tell you the answer there.  What was the answer?  I'm not saying that.  You're wrecking the timing of the bit.  You call him nicotine.  What?  That's what's in a cigarette.  Nicotine.  Oh, nicotine.  That's what I said.  Nicotine.  Nicotine.  Okay.  Enjoy.  Lucky Strike cigarettes. 
[09:12:00]  And enjoy your whiteness.  And the whiteness of your neighborhood.  Your family.  Your workplace.  The water fountain.  The buses.  Every place in America.  Lucky Strike.  The official cigarette of the Send Them Back to Africa campaign.  Feel that draw, the pleasure of smoking and living in a white country. 
[09:12:30]  After you sick the German shepherds on some Negroes, enjoy Lucky Strike cigarettes.  They're wonderful like white people.  They just all sound like that.  You can tell it's old.  Right.  There's something about the sound you can tell.  There's just that sound of rampant racism in it.  Let's try a cigarette spot for Montclair.  Montclair.  Montclair.  Montclair cigarettes. 
[09:13:00]  Montclair cigarettes.  Now, a cigarette that's low in tar and nicotine.  High in menthol flavor.  New Montclair.  Just enough in every puff.  Makes every puff a pleasure.  How much is just enough?  Just enough menthol to please your taste.  Montclair's new charcoal menthol filter does it.  Charcoal granules that are both activated and mentholated release just enough menthol to freshen every puff. 
[09:13:30]  So every puff tastes as good as the first puff.  What's so modern about Montclair?  Modern.  The answer is in Montclair's modern menthol flavor.  Yet Montclair is surprisingly low in tar and nicotine.  But the flavor's still there when you smoke Montclair.  The flavor just enough in every puff.  Makes every puff a pleasure.  Smoke Montclair.  New from the American Tobacco Company.  Mmm.  That sounds good. 
[09:14:00]  More mellow.  Yeah, that's a mellow one.  You want another lucky strike?  We'll try one more lucky strike.  Lucky.  Places all.  All join hands.  Circle left.  Now circle right and listen to me.  L-S-L-S-M-F-T.  Elementary corner's like swinging on a gauge.  Right to your honey with a right to your left eight.  Grand right and left around you go.  Lucky strike means find tobacco.  Meet your honey and give her a whirl.  All swing around with your little girl. 
[09:14:30]  Smoke him, smoke him.  Then you'll see.  L-S-L-S-M-F-T.  Promenade and don't you fall.  Promenade around the hall.  Lucky strike is first again.  First again with tobacco men.  Promenade straight down the pike.  It's time right now for a lucky strike.  Yes, first smoking that you're bound to like.  You just can't beat a lucky strike.  Yes, sir. 
[09:15:00]  They're playing that chicken picking music.  I hope whoever wrote that never smoked and still got cancer.  Swing your partner to and fro.  Look around.  No black symbol.  Ah, yes.  Lucky strike.  The wonderful flavor.  Taste the draw of lucky strike as you drop your children off at an all-white school.  No Negroes here.  The only place you want charcoal is in your filter. 
[09:15:30]  The charcoal filter of lucky strike.  Wonderful.  That's also the only place you want tar, baby.  Is in your cigarette.  Not walking the streets of your all-white neighborhood.  Lucky strike.  What a wonderful cigarette.  Good for dining, dancing, or lynching.  Light up a lucky strike.  You can light it off your zippo lighter, a match, or a burning cross on a Negro's lawn. 
[09:16:00]  Whatever it takes, light up that lucky strike.  You know why lucky strike cigarettes are so good?  Look at them.  They're white.  That's right.  When have you ever saw a black cigarette?  Never.  Because it couldn't possibly be good.  Lucky strike with their wonderful white paper.  Smoke luckies.  Because we don't like Negroes.  There he is. 
[09:16:30]  What a time.  What a time we lived in.  I think we have one more for lucky strike.  Lucky again?  I mean, no, let's try a Newport.  Another Newport ad.  These were boring, though, right?  We didn't like the first one.  I don't know.  It's kind of jazzy.  Scooby-Doo-Wah-Wah.  Smooth and fresh is the Newport taste.  Never harsh, never rough.  The smoothest tasting menthol cigarette. 
[09:17:00]  New, King Size, and New Deluxe 100s.  Little tune written for a cigarette ad, 1936.  You think she had to kill the cigarette because it was talking to her?  That voice.  Do you notice that the menthol ads have a cool, mellow thing?  Like, that was the message that was like, you hang back and have a menthol ad.  Right. 
[09:17:30]  Right.  But the other cigarettes.  Lucky.  Smoking lucky.  Let's say hi to John in Jersey.  Of course, Jersey again.  John?  Hey, what's up, guys?  What's up, bitch-ditch?  Hi, John.  I don't appreciate that type of language.  I just want to tell you guys, when Anthony said he was going to stick to German Shepherds,  I almost drove into a ditch.  You guys rock.  This is the part of the program where we allow you to compliment the bitch.  Oh, thank you. 
[09:18:00]  I'm tearing down the third wall for everyone, Anthony.  So we could feel a little better about ourselves.  What's that?  What is that, Eric?  I have no idea.  Eric, what are you doing?  A pack of Marlboros.  You ever heard that theory that the Marlboros box was designed like the KKK thing, the hoods?  Oh, really?  Yeah.  That's been around for years, that theory.  Yeah.  There are all kinds of rumors like that.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, I don't think Marlboros and cahoots with the Klan.  This is the new and improved O.B. and Anthony show, so we don't beat things into the ground. 
[09:18:30]  We'll try not to.  We're going to say cut right there.  All right.  And end the bit.  End the bit.  Bravo to Anthony.  It is over.  Coming up with that on the fly.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you for the musical accompaniment in there.  Derek, the only time you want tar, baby, is in your cigarette.  That was great.  Richard, Jenny, coming up.  No, I didn't live in those times.  I was saying those were some...  Guy's like, how old are you?  No, I wasn't around during those. 
[09:19:00]  Yeah, that's right.  Sure.  It's called a bit, silly.  All right.  Oh, God.  Yeah, me, Burt Lancaster.  We would go out and smoke.  O.B. and Anthony's Best Bits.  Most Cringe Moments.  Tom's first visit since coming to XM made this one of the best bits.  Why?  Because we thought Tippi was dead. 
[09:19:30]  Oh, that's right.  But he may not have been.  And at the end...  Wait a rune.  No, no, no, no.  He may not have been.  He might be.  But after this, you'll know.  I like it.  Best bits.  Are you guys ready to wake up Tippi Tom?  Where's the broads?  Well, I don't know where the broads are.  Where are the broads?  Nothing works the right way on this show.  Stuck in traffic.  I like how you tipped your fedora up when you said that.  Where are the broads?  We're all on.  I want to spend three over a while. 
[09:20:00]  All right, where's Keith?  Where's the holes with feet?  Keith!  Keith!  We have to make sure we do this right.  We got Tippi Tom outside the studio.  Wiggle those stems in here, dame.  No, Keith.  Come in here.  Hold on.  Keith!  Keith!  Hold up!  Keith!  Keith!  Holy shit, these fucking guys that work for us.  Sometimes they're just asleep.  Those silly geese.  Jesus.  What?  So how are you going to wake him up?  We want to set this thing up here.  You got your gloves on?  Yeah, we'll give him a little stir and see. 
[09:20:30]  Hopefully he hasn't pissed himself.  And you were telling us a little while ago that he gets really nasty when you wake him up?  Oh, yeah, he's nasty when you wake him up.  He's real nasty.  Eric is covering his nose with his shirt.  Right.  I guess it really stinks out there.  All right, we got Steve, who's filming all this for some videos that we'll get up on  opieandanthony.com later today.  All right.  It's waking up a belligerent homeless guy.  Keep that over there, the microphone.  He gets too close to me.  He's sitting on my side of the console.  Now make sure that mic is up.  Okay.  Make sure the mic works.  And test the mic. 
[09:21:00]  Test the mic.  Oh, my God.  And how are they going to hear us?  Test the mic.  The mic's on.  Okay, good.  How can they hear us?  No, but do you have headphones on so you can hear us?  No.  No, of course not.  Why would they do that?  They're waking him up.  They're waking him.  Tippi Tom.  It's Tommy.  Uh-oh, he might be dead.  No, he's not dead.  He could be.  Is he blue?  Tommy.  He looks a little blue.  He's not moving.  Oh, my God.  Is he blue?  He's taking his pulse. 
[09:21:30]  Is he dead?  Oh, my God.  No, I'm serious.  Oh, my.  We could have a problem.  Uh-oh.  Tippi Tom.  Oh, my God.  Smack him in the head.  All right.  His ears are...  No, no, no, no, no.  Don't smack him.  His ears are kind of red.  No, he's...  I think he's alive.  They can't wake him, though.  Wow.  He...  This is a...  Does he have a pulse?  Oh, my God. 
[09:22:00]  He's not waking up.  Anything you want to...  No, don't...  Don't hit him.  Don't hit him.  Don't smack him in the fire.  Anything you'd like to try, Master Poe?  He's dead.  He's taking his pulse.  Does he have a pulse?  Yeah, does he have a pulse?  You guys really need headphones out there if we're going to try to do a radio show.  Because you don't know what we're saying.  Oh, I hope we didn't kill the homeless guy.  He's the only one we have.  Does he have a pulse?  I think it's a very, very faint pulse. 
[09:22:30]  Oh, my God.  Is he waking?  Steve's got to move a little.  Steve.  How great would it be if he died on the radio show?  It wouldn't be great.  Oh, God.  What is he doing?  Master Poe.  Get a mic on Master Poe.  You know, he's got to be a deep sleeper.  He's passed out.  Yeah, he's got to be a deep sleeper.  If he's a homeless guy, you've got to sleep through a lot.  Master Poe, what do you think? 
[09:23:00]  Is he alive?  Yeah, he's alive.  If I give him a couple of pressure points, he may wake up.  But I don't want him to go to the bathroom on the floor.  Yeah.  He is breathing.  Hold a mirror up in front of his mouth.  Yeah, he's breathing.  He's breathing, and he does have a pulse.  Oh, okay.  That's all you need.  If, um...  All right, let's get the...  Oh, Steve's going to, like...  Steve's touching with those bones.  What's he's...  No, Steve's trying to snap back to the ear.  Oh, my God. 
[09:23:30]  We can't...  We cannot wake Tippi Tom.  Really, really yell at him.  Not in his ear where it'll damage anything, but, like, get right up to him and just yell,  Tom, wake up.  You know, just wake up.  There's another way to wake him up.  Tippi Tom!  Wake up, Tippi Tom!  Okay, that's not going to work.  Wow.  Somebody yell...  Come on, Tippi, get up, boy!  Don't say...  Boy.  I like the red-headed lady out there who just can't believe this is happening in the studio.  Oh, no.  She's disgusted.  Dude, he's not moving at all. 
[09:24:00]  Holy S.  How are we going to get him out of here?  Just leave him here.  Let them deal with him later.  Put him in the Frank's place, studio.  All right, what's going on out there?  Someone's got to tell us what's going on out there.  They're pouring water over his ear a little bit?  A little water.  Steve, get out of the way.  There we go.  Turn your head.  I know you've got to film it, but I don't want to see.  All right.  Keith, I need you.  What you've got to do is put your fingers in the water and then flick it onto his face. 
[09:24:30]  I don't do it?  Please tell me the homeless guy's not dead.  I think he's dead.  Oh, there he goes.  Okay.  That kind of...  Did that get him a little bit?  Did that get...  That's how you...  Oh, he's stirring.  He's stirring.  Give me a job!  What's Poe doing?  Poe is brilliant.  Yeah, we got some fun.  He's alive!  He's alive!  Thank God!  He can knock you out.  You ready to do a little more singing? 
[09:25:00]  Gotta wake up, Timmy.  You ready?  Oh, my...  I thought he was dead.  Dude, I'm not kidding you.  I thought he was dead, too.  There's a little water in the air.  Dude, did you all of a sudden have it going through your head, the news and everything?  Yes, of course.  All of a sudden, it was all going through my head.  Like, oh, my God, the news.  We're fired.  Wow!  Are you starting to wake up?  Come on, you have to wake up.  Water on the eardrop.  All right, well, you're up now.  Now, you know why?  Some people want to hear you sing.  Water on the eardrop?  I'm not singing.  We need Frank Sinatra together.  All right, I need my 15-minute rest. 
[09:25:30]  15 minutes?  It's my business, not yours.  No, no, I know, Tiffy, but we need you inside.  I don't bother you when you're resting.  It doesn't bother me.  Oh, my God.  Thank God he's alive.  Thank.  Come on, Tiffy.  I can't believe we have to say this on our radio show.  Just get the fuck out there and work and come back.  Back me up in 20 minutes.  Yeah, Tiffy, Tom, drink this.  No.  Oh, God.  He's saying no to a drink.  Wow. 
[09:26:00]  He doesn't even want to drink.  No, I want rest now.  Be my friend and give me my 15, 20 minutes.  All right, we'll give him 15 or 20 minutes.  No?  Yes, we should go make him sleep by that lady's desk, though.  Oh, God, no.  Right on the floor, by her feet.  Tiffy?  He's thinking of the place.  Yo, Tiffy.  Come on, Tiffy, we have to wake up.  Not now.  I said 20 or 15 minutes.  I'm going to tell you about my boss.  He's going to be coming in about 15 minutes.  Get the fuck out of here. 
[09:26:30]  Give him 15 minutes.  I don't sleep 15 more minutes if he wants.  I don't...  Give him my 20 minutes.  Now that we know how to wake him up, wake him up?  Yeah.  No one.  He is seconds away from getting really nasty.  Yeah, no, you were sleeping for two hours.  We need you inside, Tiffy.  Go away.  Get out of here before.  I fucking...  I told you.  Man!  I told you.  I told you.  Oh, bust somebody.  Head open.  Motherfucker.  Get the fuck out of here.  Hey, I know you. 
[09:27:00]  Get the fuck out of here.  You've been going to have a long time, a good friend.  Fuck you.  Give me my rest.  Man.  You want coffee?  No.  I'll leave.  That's what'll happen.  And you want to see me.  Give my 15, 20 minutes and get the fuck out of here.  Come on, pal.  We're going to go inside.  We're going to see you.  Oh, no.  I don't want to wake up now.  You're fucking with me. 
[09:27:30]  Go get lost.  There's this guy here.  He wants to suck your car.  I asked him.  I don't care.  Nice blow job.  Get you going good in the morning.  Come on, pal.  Leave me 15, 20 minutes, please.  He is right, man.  Fuck you, man.  They took his head off.  I'm on 15 fucking minutes, you son of a bitch.  You scum-bagged motherfuckers.  He's walking around now.  He's fucking sucked my dick. 
[09:28:00]  Eat my asshole shit.  He's walking out.  Look at the face on her out there.  Look at that mug.  Run away, Timmy.  Do we want to keep him or do we want to keep him?  Keep him.  Tell Steve to film her.  He's just wandering around the office and horrifying everyone else that works here.  You should see the mug on her.  Oh, I know.  Very angry.  She's not happy.  That's right.  Eat my asshole, he said. 
[09:28:30]  Jesus.  It's quite a meal.  You know, I'm telling you, a thick, viscous meal.  We don't...  We tell the truth on this show as much as we possibly can.  I swear, my heart sank.  I really thought he was dead.  I thought he was dead, too.  Because they were raising his arms and his head, and there was no...  He was not moving.  There was nothing.  And he kind of had a...  It was just falling.  Purple hue to him.  What's up, Ben?  Eric's on the phone with...  They're talking to him.  He's on 12 there.  Oh, okay.  Is he near the elevator?  Yeah, no. 
[09:29:00]  He's by the main door.  All right.  Eric, what's going on?  We ran out of microphone cord, but he's heading back, so we're going to throw him back on the  mic.  All right.  Oh, here he is.  Keep away from my side.  All right.  He's alive.  And he's awake.  He's coming in the studio.  He's got his fists up.  He's broke.  Hey, come on in here, Tippi.  What bad ass chicken you want?  What's up?  Tippi, what's going on out there?  Don't break me up.  I'm trying to get a little knack.  We need you inside, Tippi.  But you're here to perform, no?  I bust his ass.  I thought you wanted to sing another song. 
[09:29:30]  You want to fight?  Yeah, I'll fight you.  We're going to fight.  Hope he's getting up.  I'm not fighting him.  Bro, dope you want?  You want a bruised nose?  One of those gritty knuckles in your face?  Not even.  He'll just lick your mouth and nose.  End of fight.  Ha, ha, ha.  All right, Tippi Tom, let's work this out.  What happened?  You're going to get your ass beat.  All right.  What happened out there?  Here's what's happening.  What's going on there?  I have no idea what happened to you.  What's going on?  You're a deep sleeper, by the way.  I'm trying to get a little nap. 
[09:30:00]  Okay.  Because, you know, I'm a little sleepy.  A little tired from all the work that you do.  Tippi Tom, a little sleepy, you know what I'm saying?  And so I try to take a little nap.  And these motherfuckers over here give me a hard time.  So what I got to do, I don't, it's not I don't love them, but what I'm saying is that  I want to take my nap.  But you were napping for about two hours.  No.  Yeah, you were.  We watched you sleeping. 
[09:30:30]  It was two hours.  It wasn't two hours.  It's been two hours.  You're lying.  It wasn't two hours.  I don't lie.  I had a nap for about half an hour.  It was two hours, Tippi Tom.  Well, Tippi Tom, he's unhappy.  And something I'm saying is this, is that I'm going to bust somebody's nose.  All right.  Bust his nose.  That guy is the problem right there.  I'm trying to get another half hour in. 
[09:31:00]  Yeah.  Can we get a song before you go back to sleep?  Can we get another song before you go back to sleep?  A little lullaby, maybe.  Sing me a lullaby, please.  Um, if I do one, I would.  Yes, you do.  Come on.  The one you always sing.  Which one?  You always sing your lullaby?  Yeah.  Sing the lullaby.  All right.  Radio station, right?  Yeah.  Right on.  All right.  Here we go.  Fairytales can't come true. 
[09:31:30]  They can happen to you.  Obviously.  If you're young at heart.  Now, let me tell you that.  That's all you get.  That's all we get.  Hey, we want to hear about the drag queen from last night.  It's hard to find the matter, the matter, if you're young at heart.  But if you should survive. 
[09:32:00]  To 102 or 3?  Something like that.  Yeah.  If you are amongst the young at heart, give me your writing to that.  All right.  Now, I can't do it like him.  All right.  Can we, um, we want to know about the drag queen.  What do you want to know about?  We want to know about the drag queen last night.  The drag queens?  All right.  Now, this drag queen.  You got a BJ from a drag queen, right?  We're on 4th Street, right? 
[09:32:30]  Yep.  Yeah.  She come over to me, right?  Mm-hmm.  She says, hey, good looking.  What's cooking?  What the fuck are you talking about?  My underwear.  She thought I was good looking.  Making stew.  And Timmy Tom said, wait a second now.  I know you're good looking.  You're good looking, too.  So what are we going to do about this?  He's going to use Jay Moore's line. 
[09:33:00]  Yeah.  So we got...  Did you pull your pants down?  So we got two good looking people together.  And black queen.  Yeah.  We're pretty damn good, yourself.  And so I got busy.  Where'd you go?  Behind the dumpster?  Well, we were going to do it behind the dumpster. 
[09:33:30]  I didn't know.  You're a little more romantic than that.  Let's do it right on the sidewalk, man.  We're going to get busy.  So you pulled out your hog?  And we make money.  Sounds like George Carlin, doesn't he?  Damn fucking right.  Bullshit.  No behind the dumpster.  So what happened?  You pulled out your hog?  I'm not no cheap fuck.  I'm serious.  We are going to get busy.  Right there. 
[09:34:00]  Motherfuckers.  And that's what happened was this.  We did our thing.  I ain't going to go into details.  You pulled out the old him squirt gun.  Can we see your stuff?  No.  No, no.  Opie.  What's wrong with you?  Don't give me time on the radio now.  Can we see your stuff?  Shut up.  You guys shut up.  Yeah, let's see it.  I'm trying to explain myself. 
[09:34:30]  After we got busy.  Yeah?  Yeah?  Busy?  I gave her a buck.  You gave her a buck?  Oh, a buck.  All right.  Lots of money.  She wanted to get her on the train.  But she needed a buck fifty.  I said, all right.  I'll get you more fifty cents.  So where'd you get her fifty cents from?  So I bought her fifty cents from my buddy. 
[09:35:00]  He gave me fifty cents.  So I get her on the train.  And we done gone fuckin' over there.  And so make sure she go home.  She said, hey, Timmy time, why'd you come back to my house?  Oh.  I said, yeah.  I'll meet you later on.  And he motherfuckers rubbed me up over here.  And so I'm all fucked up. 
[09:35:30]  So I got her on the train.  I bumped for you to send my buddy.  Give her my dollar.  And she gonna go up town.  And that's what happened.  All right.  So, fuck town.  And with that, why don't you...  So he's got one clean spot on his body.  All I got out of this whole fucking deal  was a fucking blowjob.  All right.  And that was...  How about one more song and then you could go nap?  I'd get the fuck out of here.  One more song and then you could go nap. 
[09:36:00]  Yeah, take a second.  And then we'll wait you out for the grand finale  at the end of the show.  Yeah, one more song.  All right, will Timmy time belt one out?  Yeah, let's all belt one out.  Here we go.  I like the dance moves.  Let me snap this one out.  All right.  Everybody stand back.  All right, stand back.  Clear the field.  Some bums are gonna do something singing.  Rock and roll or something a little different?  I think we're enjoying the love songs  or the nursery rhyme type things.  A little love song.  Something tender. 
[09:36:30]  Something tender, sure.  All right, a little tender.  Yeah.  I left my heart in San Francisco.  Right next to the soap.  High on hell, it calls to me.  Little cable cars.  Ah, fuck.  I can't perform now. 
[09:37:00]  No.  You know I get no song.  He turns really quickly, doesn't he?  Temperamental little fella.  Yeah.  Yeah, I did.  That's for me.  He's like Sinatra.  All right, he's leaving.  He's leaving.  Please make him talk to other people in the office.  Please.  Please.  She's miserable out there.  All right, I'll sing a song in a little while.  All right, a little while he's gonna sing a date,  get a nap.  There he goes.  I'll kiss my ass.  Timmy Tom doesn't want to talk. 
[09:37:30]  All right, Timmy Tom doesn't want to talk, Anthony.  Now, give me a fucking horn.  Give me a what?  Who am I talking to?  Fucking horn.  All right, look.  I'll tell you right now.  He's outside the studio.  On mic, yes.  Don't feel good.  I got tummy upset.  And so, what I'm saying is that.  What I'm saying is that is I love you and be well.  All right.  I will bust your ass if you give me a hard time. 
[09:38:00]  But I love you.  Hang on, Brett.  Make him go to sleep.  The thing is that.  Go to sleep.  I love you.  I love you too.  Go to sleep.  I need a nap, all right?  And I'll come back and visit, all right?  All right.  Take a nap.  Please.  Good night.  About five minutes and I'll come back.  All right.  We'll get Timmy Tom back in here in a little while.  Let's say hi to Jerry in Jersey.  Yes, Jerry.  Hi.  I'm imagining his hot, stinky, alcohol breath in my face and I'm gagging over here. 
[09:38:30]  I know.  He just woke up.  He was sleeping.  And then his morning breath.  Oh, yeah.  The videos will be up on opianthony.com.  And I smell a promo.  Tippi Tom sings.  You got sweepers.  The love ballads.  Tippi Tom sings.  The love ballads.  All right, guys.  All right.  Thank you, Jerry.  I have a question for Master Paul.  What did you do to drop me?  You can't.  Outside the studio, no one can wake him up.  And you just dripped a little bit of water on his ear and he was up.  Yeah. 
[09:39:00]  Water was nice and cold and it went down his ear and just woke him up.  Just like that.  All the slapping and hitting him with the microphone did nothing but a drop of water in his ear.  One drop of water.  One drop of cold water right in his ear canal, right?  Exactly.  Went down his eardrum.  That wakes you up.  That'll wake you up.  All right.  I think my brother's on to something here.  He just handed me a note.  Have a homeless American Idol contest.  Oh, jeez.  Imagine getting...  Is there any other guys out there that sing?  Tippi Tom that sings like...  Well, Ziggy used to, but Ziggy's dead. 
[09:39:30]  Yeah, Ziggy.  Rock and roll Tommy.  Rock and roll Tommy.  It's not a bad idea.  It's a great idea.  Ziggy's dead, baby.  Ziggy's dead.  We could give this to...  Keith, you want to run with this?  Oh, Ziggy.  Yeah.  Keith could be the Simon Cow of this bit.  I think I could think of a couple other...  A couple more singing homeless that we can come up with?  Singing homeless?  Sure, absolutely.  Oh, my God.  They're spraying them down right now.  Yeah, they are.  All right.  Why don't we step aside, take a break?  Is there anything you want to hear going into break?  This is a great smoothie.  I'll say it is.  It's banana.  It's orange.  You don't know what to make of it. 
[09:40:00]  It's fantastic.  But it all falls under the subheading of yummy.  You guys want to hear anything going into break?  Uh...  No?  Nothing I can think of.  Nothing pops in your head?  Eh, whatever you want, Ope.  Uh...  Nothing aside from that foul stench is popping in my head.  Exactly.  It's just awful.  All right, we'll just do this then.  I really do want to see his mule, though.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony's Best Bits Ever.  So don't go anywhere, because there's more.

[09:41:30]  and revisit some of the happiest and more horrifying bits  from the Opie and Anthony show  as chosen by you, the listener.  There you go, there's a selling point.  Next time on a very special Ron and Fez.  Ron makes a tough decision.  Great, Ron.  Another dead hooker in the office.  Well, what's it going to be?  Dump the body in the river or bury it in Jersey?  Let's bury this one.  Last one we dumped surface too soon.  Fine.  I'll get the shovels and the lime.  Uh, let's use your car.  I just had mine washed. 
[09:42:00]  You know, I'd love just one weekend  that didn't involve getting rid of a corpse.  Ron and Fez on XM 202.  Artist Confidential.  XM presents a special Christmas edition  of Artist Confidential  with Mannheim Steamroller.  The fact that we've been able to come into people's homes  and be part of their Christmas tradition,  I think, is the part that makes my heart the warmest.  Hear Mannheim Steamroller this afternoon 
[09:42:30]  at 3 p.m. Eastern  on XM Live, Fine Tuning,  and Holly, Channel 103.  Artist Confidential.  Revolutionary.  Exclusive music programming from XM.  XM 202.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Larry King.  Celine Dion.  Son.  Kayaks.  ONA's Best Fits.  Perfect.  You just reminded me of something.  We didn't play the audio of Celine Dion on Larry King.  No, we didn't.  This was priceless.  She was very upset.  Let's...  We all understand that it was a disaster down there. 
[09:43:00]  Mm-hmm.  But how could you not laugh  when Celine Dion just breaks into song on Larry King?  Because that's going to help the victims.  That's what they need.  A song from Celine.  Ew, she sang.  Oh, my God.  This is really creepy.  Ew.  It's deeply disturbing.  Yeah.  I understand everyone.  Even we have been affected,  and we're trying to do our part,  but God damn, man.  Some of these people have got to relax.  Like Ben brought in the picture of Sean Penn  walking around New Orleans with a shotgun. 
[09:43:30]  A shotgun.  Here it is right here.  He's walking around with a shotgun, I guess,  to protect himself as he goes on his rescue missions.  I don't know.  There's a lot of stories about the shotgun.  Supposedly, he found it laying around and picked it up.  Oh.  Oh, please.  Others say that he brought it himself.  I was handing this to the police.  Right.  Shithead, you got caught.  It's okay for you to have a gun for protection,  but nobody else, right?  Yeah.  His little scheme backfired.  You know, this guy brought his own photographer down there 
[09:44:00]  as he's rescuing people.  That's just no good.  I thought he was an asshole for many years,  but it turns out he really is kind of just a weirdo.  Like, he's one of those real weird guys.  Be more like your brother.  He's fat and jolly and makes fun movies.  Looks like an alcoholic.  What a mess he is.  That's how I'm going to say that word from now on.  Alcoholic.  Alcoholic.  Maybe I'll get him on the show.  We have the same manager. 
[09:44:30]  I'll talk to my manager.  We need to stop it.  See if I get in credit.  No, I've talked to Chris Penn in the past.  I've never met him.  Oh, we did.  We did many years ago.  No, in person, too.  Oh.  I got a picture with Chris Penn.  I want one.  I should bring in all my old celebrity photos.  They're kind of funny.  You should.  Throw them up on the website there.  All right, here we go.  Celine Dion.  We got to play this a little bit here.  Celine.  A little bit.  Celine Dion and Larry King last week.  I have to say, Larry,  that I'm as devastated as the rest of the world.  Devastated? 
[09:45:00]  If I may, I was watching you behind.  There's a television right now.  I'm watching, and I'm especially waiting,  like the rest of the world.  I'm waking up in the morning.  I'm having a coffee.  I barely can swallow it.  Yeah, through your little pigeon neck.  She sounds like Christopher Walken.  Oh, I can barely swallow it.  I barely can swallow it.  She's in one of those ridiculous suites in Las Vegas.  From my huge 38-inch plasma television, 
[09:45:30]  I could not take the pain and anguish of those people  as I looked down on Las Vegas from my penthouse suite.  Why couldn't you swallow the coffee?  Was her husband using her mouth to practice rolling Dyson?  Well, we've heard he's got a problem.  What can I tell you?  We all have problems.  And I'm especially waiting, like the rest of the world.  I'm waking up in the morning.  I'm having a coffee.  I barely can swallow it.  I come here at Caesars Palace every night to perform. 
[09:46:00]  I barely can sing.  Yeah, well.  But for respect for the people who come,  I am still singing.  When I come home at night,  my son is waiting for me.  I watch television.  Yes, we gave a million dollars.  But what do you expect?  What I want to look like the rest of the world.  I open the television.  There's people...  How do you open a television?  I open the television. 
[09:46:30]  Opie, I don't think we should make fun of this.  She's still saying while those people suffered,  she's brave.  She is brave.  She's a brave girl.  We gave a million dollars.  I have a coffee.  We...  I don't know what plural is.  How about buying an S, you foreign whore?  Watch television.  Yes, we gave a million dollars.  But what we expect,  what I want to look like the rest of the world,  I open the television. 
[09:47:00]  See, it was a dollar,  and she just wrote a million on it.  Million dollar.  It was a million dollar.  And I open the television,  and I see wires and tubes.  And I don't know what year it is  because there's never tubes in TVs anymore,  you idiot.  I open television.  What?  But what we expect,  what I want to look like the rest of the world,  I open the television.  There's people still there,  waiting to be rescued.  And for me, it's not acceptable.  I know there's reasons for it. 
[09:47:30]  I'm sorry to say I'm being rude,  but I don't want to hear those reasons.  You know, some people...  They should fly her over,  fly her over like the flooded areas.  Yeah.  In a helicopter and lower her down,  and then she could sing the Titanic song.  Wouldn't that be great?  As they're hanging on to their roofs.  Hold on, Tyrone.  Tyrone, don't let go.  Don't ever let go, Tyrone.  If only there was room enough for you on that door 
[09:48:00]  that your girlfriend is on right now.  It could be a huge cavernous door  and there still wouldn't be room.  Have you seen the women down there?  Big fat asses.  You are a survivor.  Many people perished  under the brown sewage of New Orleans.  Much like they did that fateful night  in April of 19...  18? 12? 14? 
[09:48:30]  19. 12.  It was 12. Shut up.  All right, sorry.  Much like they perished  in the icy waters of the North Atlantic  on that fateful maiden voyage of the Titanic.  But some of them were  survivors.  And Larry, I watch. 
[09:49:00]  I watch and personally I don't care.  But I cry.  I cry because my husband  is 90 fucking years old.  I cry when I think he touched me  when I was 14.  Forced me to marry him.  That is why I weep today.  You think I really care  about the shwoogies, Larry?  How many bodies lie there beneath 
[09:49:30]  that mucky, brown, stinky mess?  I say pee you, Larry.  And some of them cling to their rooftops  like many clung to life jackets  and pieces of wood  on that fateful night  on the Titanic.  They are truly, 
[09:50:00]  truly  Negroes.  They are so poor  and so black.  All right, back to the audio.  Jesus.  That was fantastic.  Stop it.  Back to Celine.  Mark crying, Celine.  And for me,  it's not acceptable.  I know there's reasons for it.  I'm sorry to say  I'm being rude,  but I don't want to hear  those reasons.  You know,  some people are stealing  and they're making 
[09:50:30]  a big deal out of it.  Oh, they're stealing  20 pairs of jeans  or they're stealing  television sets.  Who cares?  They're not going to go  too far with it.  Maybe those people  are so poor.  Some of the people  who do that,  they're so poor.  They've never touched  anything in their lives.  Let them touch  those things for once.  Invite them into your house.  Let them touch.  You also have never  touched a seat  at your show  at Caesars,  you fucking overpriced  Canadian hosebag.  But you never touched  an orchestra seat there,  did they?  Oh, my God. 
[09:51:00]  Let them touch stuff.  Let them just touch it.  That's the biggest  cock tease ever.  Here,  feel this plasma TV  that you'll never have.  How racist she is.  Holy shit.  Just touch it.  Just touch it  because that'll  make you feel better.  Unfortunately,  they were touching  guns at Walmarts  and touching the triggers.  Stop it.  I was inspired  when they taught  Coco to sign.  Oh,  she did not say  let the people touch.  Just touch it. 
[09:51:30]  Just touch it.  Oh, my goodness.  The people who do that,  they're so poor.  They've never touched  anything in their lives.  Let them touch  those things  for once.  The main thing  right now,  it's not the people  who are stealing.  It's the people  who are left there  and they're watching  helicopters flying  over their heads.  Lobsters.  And they're praying.  How come it's so easy  to send planes  in another country  to kill everyone  in a second  to destroy lives? 
[09:52:00]  We need to serve  our country.  And for me  to serve our country  is to be there  right now  to rescue  the rest of the people.  We need the cash.  We need the blood.  We need the support.  Right now,  we need the prayers.  Jesus,  where's Larry  through that whole  right there?  Jesus,  I was nodding off.  She has the foreign  policy inside  of a six-year-old.  How do we send  bombs to blow up  the world  and the universe?  In seconds.  In seconds.  Everything.  I can't get over 
[09:52:30]  the fact  let them touch things.  Just touch it.  Much like  the poor passengers  that were stuck  in steerage  on the Titanic,  we should just  pull gates shut  and lock them  to drown  in their basements.  Look, Tyrone,  you'll never have  an iPod,  but hey,  feel free to touch it.  I want to touch it.  Right.  Oh.  Oh, is that the best?  What a mess she is.  She continued  on Larry King  last week.  It is,  you know,  when I was hearing 
[09:53:00]  a couple of days ago  that these things  are not reachable,  it's too full of water,  maybe I'm too much  like in my,  I'm not thinking  with my head,  I'm talking  with my heart.  Nobody can open  any roofs.  The helicopter's  flying in,  take two people  at a time,  take a kayak,  go into those walls.  Take a kayak?  A kayak.  Oh, she's an  outdoorsy one.  Or take a limo  like I do  to go to my shows.  What?  Why can't they  take the flying  Steve car 
[09:53:30]  and please  pick up these people?  Take a kayak.  Oh,  it is so easy  if Steve  would,  just there he is now,  just fly by Steve,  land and pick  these people up  in your flying  hybrid car.  The helicopter's  flying in,  take two people  at a time,  take a kayak,  go into those walls.  What?  There's,  what?  Kids being ready.  You can't take a kayak 
[09:54:00]  through walls.  Take a kayak  through those walls?  What does she say?  She watches  Gilligan's Island  too much,  she thinks that's  how they get around.  A kayak.  Jesus,  this isn't  I Dream of Jeannie.  Is Jim leaving  a permanent thing?  No.  Oh,  stop it.  Stop it.  A big part of the show  and he'll be  coming back and forth  and doing this  and doing that.  Don't you worry.  There's  kids being raped 
[09:54:30]  at night.  We hear gunshots.  Big guns.  What's that?  Those people are playing,  they're walking,  they're like this.  Hello?  Do you see us?  We're still alive.  But we're dying.  It's terrible.  I do not want to talk  to you about money.  What?  Holy crap.  Will you just shut up  and sing your stupid song?  She lost her fucking mind  and it's fantastic.  We can't see them at night  because they're dark  until they smile.  We see teeth. 
[09:55:00]  We think they're floating dentures  but there are people  attached to those.  Oh,  she an ass.  I thought somebody dropped  a big package  of ping pong balls  and I was looking  but it was humans  looking up at me.  I thought it was  ping pong balls  and chiclets  but it wasn't Larry.  It was people.  Wow. 
[09:55:30]  Wow, wow, wow.  Let's say hi to Carl  in New Jersey.  Carl?  Hey, she sounds like  Mr. Wett.  Do you remember  Mr. Wett?  Mr. Wett.  Yeah,  there was two radio DJs  that had a show  back in the day.  I forget their names.  It was the fact that  you and Anthony  referenced them  all the time  once in a while  back in the day.  And she was like,  Mr. Wett,  I'm from the sewer.  I live under the ground.  I'm Mr. Wett.  Never, ever, ever.  This guy is amazing.  I could have saved... 
[09:56:00]  I'm sorry, Carl.  I really don't know  what you're talking about.  All right,  let's continue with...  Why are you taking  the birthday cake out?  Huh?  Oh, okay.  All right,  more of Celine Dion.  Of course, please.  I want this burnt  so I could listen  to it on the way home.  Of course.  We're going to have  Maury Povich in studio  in a few minutes as well,  so stay there.  Maury.  But first,  more Celine Dion.  This is too good.  Maury's going to have  to wait a few minutes.  We've been doing the show  now for two and a half hours.  We've been asking  a lot of people 
[09:56:30]  how they can help,  how you can help.  A lot of people  all over the world  want to help.  You gave a million dollars.  You're going to help  a lot of people  live and survive.  You should take  great pride in that.  One,  that you've attained  the ability  to be able to do that,  to be able to give  a million dollars.  You should take  pride in that.  I understand it's  very important  because eventually  we will need that money.  But it's just  very frustrating  that Franco  and Conscious West  and me,  oh,  we have one million dollar. 
[09:57:00]  If this is one thing,  in three months,  in six months,  they will need that money.  Right now,  they're praying for water.  So we need to  send them the water.  They don't care  about my check.  No,  they do.  It's just frustrating  because on our parts  of the world,  we're trying our death  and we're expecting  those people.  Oh,  she don't shut up.  I'm sorry.  Or something.  And I'm sending  Welch's grape juice  and garlic.  Old,  doddering old buffoon. 
[09:57:30]  Yeah,  you know,  I love Larry King's style  where he pretty much  doesn't do anything  on his show  and lets the people talk.  But sometimes,  as a host,  you gotta jump in there  a little bit.  My God,  is she upset?  Shut up.  All right,  here's the,  here is the clip  of clips.  I know you gotta go on soon,  but we couldn't  spend any time with you  without asking you,  do you have any kind of thing  you would like to sing  that fits this moment?  She's got a song  for everything.  Larry?  She's got a song  for everything. 
[09:58:00]  Is there any song  in your,  even if you did  a little of it?  I don't want to.  Well,  the only song  that comes to my mind  right now  is definitely a prayer.  What's going on  in Larry King's mind?  You think he knows  she's just a,  you know,  just a lunatic  at this point  and is exploiting that?  Yeah.  Or is he dead serious  about having Celine,  Dion sing a song  for everybody?  I think he's just trying  to get as much out of her 
[09:58:30]  as he can  and at this point  having her do a song  is the icing.  You think so?  Is he being that calculating  or is he just  an out-of-touch ass?  That's what I'm wondering,  you know.  Sing a song.  The Motley Crue.  Because she's not  in the right frame of mind  to actually sing a song.  Let's see how this  plays out.  It's definitely a prayer.  I did sing that song  a few weeks,  a few years back  with Andrea Bocelli.  Oh, yes.  And I cannot think,  I cannot think about a song 
[09:59:00]  about a prayer.  I will do my very best  and I'll do my best.  General Scott  surrender in Darmasis.  I pray you'll be alright  and watch us where we go  and help us to be wise  in times when we don't know. 
[09:59:30]  Let this be our prayer.  when we lose our way  lead us to a place  guide us with your grace.  Liar, whore, liar, whore,  and you know it.  To the place  where we'll be safe.  Shut your goddamn pie hole.  I pray we'll find your life. 
[10:00:00]  You can get a doggy style,  you can get a lean on your side.  And those are your only choices.  This is my house  and I get the same.  You can hold me on hearts  when stars go out each night  reminds us where you are  let this be our prayer  fancy talk  fancy talk, rock, whore.  Let us feel our days 
[10:00:30]  help us find a place  guide us with your grace.  Now choke yourself.  Give us faith  so we'll be safe.  Well, no shit.  That's it, come on.  Okay, terrific.  And there you have it.  That's very dramatic.  Wow.  Celine Dion, Larry King, last week. 
[10:01:00]  Wow.  Liar, whore, liar, whore.  There you go.  Wow, she lost her mind.  That's fantastic.  Opioid Anthony's best fix.  Most, bestest sweeper.  You're listening to the worst  of Opioid Anthony.  Number three.  The Opioid Anthony program.  Or that stupid XM stinger they do.  What is it?  XM 202.  You know that awful, terrible, boring song 
[10:01:30]  the Edmund Fitzgerald  that seems to just go on forever?  Yeah.  I'm so glad we're all here for this.  Well, tell us more.  The guys go through it and play it  and they come up with some funny verses  for that song.  Alternate lyrics?  Yes.  Wow.  Alternate lyrics.  And it went something like this.  I gotta tell you though,  one of the best reality shows on TV  is that goddamn stupid crab fishing show.  I don't know how I got caught up in that thing.  The hell was the crab fishing show?  The most dangerous catch on Discovery Channel.  You ever hear about this? 
[10:02:00]  No.  They put cameras on a bunch of these ships  that go out into the Bering Sea in Alaska.  I thought they put cameras on toilet seats.  No.  Oh, what are you talking about?  Crab fishing.  Crab fishing.  They put them on all these crabbing boats  and they go out into the Bering Sea.  They're by Alaska and they go crabbing.  Now you'd think, okay, how is that a TV show?  Apparently this is like one of the most dangerous jobs  in the world.  People dying all the time.  And it's a reality show 
[10:02:30]  because they follow these people's lives  and personalities and their jobs.  And what we've all wanted to see on reality shows,  people are dropping dead.  Really?  People are dying.  They show the captain of some ship  showing how to put on some emergency gear  and then they're out on a boat  and one of the cameramen see the captain on the radio  and the ship capsized, sunk.  The captain that was just doing the little thing  on his gear  and six of his crewmen are dead 
[10:03:00]  and another guy falls overboard.  He's dead.  People are getting injured all the time.  This is reality.  Why else would you watch a crab fishing show?  I hope they bring up a bunch of crabs.  They've got to interview the crabs.  They have new deaths every week.  It's like a holocaust.  The crab holocaust.  Unbelievable.  But I got roped into watching this.  I'm watching it now all the time.  Most dangerous catch.  I never knew the show was on TV. 
[10:03:30]  I sit there doing the Regan bit.  I'm watching fishing.  I'm not even fishing.  I'm watching fishing.  But is the crab show,  it's just being filmed.  There's no phony reality angle, right?  No, it's just these guys.  They're all a little kooky to be out there.  It's only a few days a couple of times a year that they do this.  And they could walk away with upwards of $10,000, $15,000 each for just a few days' work.  But it's just the worst job ever. 
[10:04:00]  There's no immunity challenge?  No, no challenges.  Actually, they do have a Budweiser-sponsored crab count with which ship brings in the most pounds of crab.  They should have, like, a body count because people are dropping dead.  There was one ship just keeled over.  And they found out that they had too many of these crab traps on it.  And it was top-heavy, overloaded.  The captain, yeah, screwed up and paid with his life.  Was that, like, by Lake Gichiguni? 
[10:04:30]  Was it going from Cleveland into Canada somewhere?  And there was a storm?  The Edmund Fitzgerald?  Well, our crab pots were full and we came into shore and...  I really like that song.  Jimmy was asking his questions.  That stupid Gordon Lightfoot.  This song goes on forever.  I love it, though.  Jesus.  And the water was at my ankles and this song goes on another hour.  Is that the song that makes you just get all tingly, Jimmy?  I just like it because I like the fact that he's doing a 40-minute ballad about... 
[10:05:00]  The wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald.  I looked at the fuel gauge.  It was three-quarters full.  And we motored on toward our destination.  And then we bought a Rolls-Royce on eBay.  Hey, we could kill seven minutes.  Let this play today.  Oh, my God.  He asked for my money back.  He said, drop dead, you horse-tooth-doo.  You're getting nothing back.  The legend lives on from the Chippewa home down.  The big lake they call Kitchagumi.  Kitchagumi. 
[10:05:30]  All right.  The lake, it is said, never gives up for dead when the skies of November turn gloomy.  Gloomy.  Kitchagumi with gloomy.  With a load of iron ore, 26,000 tons more.  And the Edmund Fitzgerald weighed empty.  I smelt bad from fish and put on perfumey.  That good shipping true was a bone to be chewed when the gills of November came early.  They cast off yet?  We untied the bow line and untied the stern. 
[10:06:00]  And I started the engine with a turn of the key.  Jesus.  Every friggin' step of the way of the Edmund Fitzgerald.  We get it already.  We get it.  You're on a boat.  I took a compass heading of 135 and I turned the wheel.  All right.  And the purser got me my coffee.  I take it light and sweet, but he made it too dark.  And I sent them back to the galley.  All right.  What happened?  What happened next?  Oh.  I went to sleep in my heart, sleep paralysis, and I woke up to the exorcist's face in my bed. 
[10:06:30]  It was on forever.  The wind and the wind made it travel till sun.  Watch it.  And the wind through the walls are wheeling.  The song's only half over and I still see the dark.  As the captain did too, it was the witch of love and the earth was stealing. 
[10:07:00]  I forgot my wallet in my car, so we turned the ship around and we docked again and I figured  I'd stop for a beer.  Oh.  When afternoon came, it was freezing rain.  Tune in and two hours later when the ship finally sinks.  Enough.  And then there's, oh, throw in a musical interlude to make it longer.  Christ.  I put on my life vest and helped my crew put it on, too, and we stood there and, well, 
[10:07:30]  the water's now up to our knees.  See, look, there's...  All right, we'll just kind of...  It's still going.  We'll take a few phone calls and then we'll go back to the song in a minute.  Scott in Arizona.  What's up, Scott?  Hey, how you guys doing this morning?  Pretty good.  What's up?  Pretty...  Ah, hey, I got...  Hey, don't get me wrong here.  You guys are great, man.  I mean, I love the shit out of you guys.  I got a little...  I got a little complaint about the crabbing thing. 
[10:08:00]  I spent 15 years up in Alaska commercial fishing and then I just got in my big truck this  morning and boom, first thing I turned you guys on this morning, you guys  complaining about the show.  What?  Yeah.  Who's complaining?  Oh, you said you didn't like it and then you're making fun of a bunch of...  I love the crab show.  That's what I was saying.  Were you listening or were you like me?  I'm not listening.  You better listen to the replay to hear what you meant.  Listen to the replay.  I love the crab show.  I said I can't stop watching it. 
[10:08:30]  Oh, I apologize.  Dad, my brain fart.  My thing was I was saying that all crabbers are bums and incompetents.  Anthony was disagreeing.  Well, I have to agree with you there.  All right.  Thank you.  We're going to move on.  Tad again from San Francisco.  I watched the History Channel show on the Edmund Fitzgerald.  It took three minutes for the boat to sink.  So it takes longer for the song to play than it took for the boat to actually sink.  Well, let's see where the song is.  All right.  Where are we?  Where did he have water coming in and the good ship and crew was in peril? 
[10:09:00]  All right.  It's just starting to sink.  We'll go back to the song in a little while and see what happens.  Let's take a couple of hours.  I said, hey, dude, what do you think about this?  He said, I don't know.  There might be a hole in the boat.  So we went down to the engine room and, yeah, there was a hole.  And we sat and smoked a cigarette or two because it really wasn't that bad.  Let's say hi to Alex in Boston.  Alex?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I got two points.  Jimmy, don't you play the most dangerous catch every night?  That's not bad.  That's not bad.  Jimmy tangling with some painted vagina. 
[10:09:30]  It's me on a boat with three Craigslist prostitutes.  And crabs are involved also.  Very nice.  And Rick Ross buys a car like people buy drugs.  Give him the money first, wait, and I'll come back with a car.  Uh-oh.  Oh, boy.  You should have started with that one.  Speaking of cars.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you, Jimmy.  Let's go back to the song and see where Gordon Lightfoot is at.  Rick of the Edmund and Sparrow. 
[10:10:00]  Uh-oh.  That gets down.  Yeah.  All right.  We'll check back.  He's still in that musical interlude there.  Who's that other ballad singer?  Oh, Steve Flamefoot.  He's like.  With a captain wired and had some water coming in.  Oh, Steve Flamefoot.  Oh, 27,000 tons more than the Edmund Fitzgerald. 
[10:10:30]  Jesus, he separated the tea and the tea.  We have a little problem.  The striples, they won't take their clothes off.  Striples?  The striples.  Yes.  They're kind of like an Australian children's naked singing group.  All right.  Before we go to break, let's see where Gordon Lightfoot is here.  All right.  He's still going?  Music.  Music.  Does anyone know where the love of God goes when the waves turn the minutes to hours? 
[10:11:00]  Minutes to hours.  The searchers all say they'd have made whitefish pay if they'd put 15 more miles behind her.  Huh?  They might have split up or they might have capsized.  They may have grown deep and just water.  And all that remains is the faces and the names of the wives and the sons and the daughters.  All right.  We'll go back to Gordon Lightfoot after the break. 
[10:11:30]  He's still singing along.  Now he's singing about the survivors and everything.  The wife remarried and had three kids and can't even remember his name.  Been 15 years and now I'm going to sing about his children's experience in elementary school.  That's a bit of a long tune.  Oh, Christ.  I think we were making that point, Jimmy.  Oh, that's true. 
[10:12:00]  I just jump in like, hey, guys, I have a thought.  That's a long song.  It's a long song.  Gordon, you come.  Gordon Lightfoot.  Heavy on the pen, though.  And my typewriter ran out of ink.  Yeah.  He doesn't get to the end of the end.  Oh, that's hilarious.  Let's go to Chris in New Jersey.  Chris, what's up? 
[10:12:30]  Hey, what's going on, guys?  How you doing, Chicken Lips?  That's very mean-spirited.  What?  What?  What's painful?  What?  That fucking song.  That Gordon Lightfoot song.  You don't like that song?  No, dude.  It's fucking horrible.  It's not horrible.  It's terrible.  What do you prefer?  What kind of song do you prefer?  If I could just jump in and make a relative comparison.  Anything but that.  That's a long thing, sir.  I'll listen to Brother Joe's Journey covers, you know.  I just don't do it.  This is all I had to say.  First of all, Loverboy did not do that fucking song with The Outfield, that I Want to Lose 
[10:13:00]  Your Love Tonight.  Oh, yeah.  Lose The Outfield.  Very good.  And Night Ranger's other song was Don't Tell Me You Love Me.  Oh, that's right.  Oh, that was a huge hit.  Yeah, I remember that one.  Thank you, Chris.  Very informative.  You don't like Gordon Lightfoot, but you know Night Ranger and Loverboy songs from 1981?  Yeah, well, come on, dude.  1981, I was around then.  Like, I wasn't around when that song came out, that Gordon Lightfoot.  I'm guessing in the mid-70s, probably after the actual accident.  All right.  Yeah, my parents were eating granola and I wasn't born yet, so. 
[10:13:30]  All right.  Thank you, Chris.  All right, guys.  We've got to get back to Gordon Lightfoot.  Where is he at in this stupid song of his?  Lake Huron, Rose Superior Scenes  In the rooms of her ice-water mansion  Oh, Michigan steams like a young man's dreams  The islands and days are for sportsmen  Then the sun's supernova, then the earth was burned to a crisp  And it's 50 billion years in the future 
[10:14:00]  It's in what Lake Erie can send her  All right, we'll get back to Gordon Lightfoot.  We're Mylar suits and we colonize Mars.  And Danny finally got a sign on this TV show.  God, did I fuck that one up?  And Danley finally got a sign on the TV show.  I wouldn't hurt you, Danley.  I love every goddamn half a sign on your head.  Then when should we take Danley to see a doctor? 
[10:14:30]  As soon as possible.  I'm an elsehole.  Danley.  Oh, that's funny.  Devin from New Hampshire.  Andrea Yates played that song as she drowned her kids.  And the next one looked up and said,  Hey, what's going on here, Mom?  When the bubble stopped, four more to go.  And the workers all... 
[10:15:00]  Oh, shit.  The searchers all say they'd have made 21 if this bitch had taken her medicine.  Five little unopened boxes under the tree.  Well, speaking of Gorn life,  And two disappointed grandparents.  Let's see where Gorn is in the song.  As I set off to sail from Modesto. 
[10:15:30]  A splash and a tear as my wife disappeared  Neat the blue briny waters of Modesto.  Are we finally at the end?  I don't know.  Oh.  Is that it?  In a musty old hall in Detroit, 
[10:16:00]  They prayed in the Marathon Sailor's Cathedral.  Oh, she's been pregging now.  The church bell chimed to the bank 29 times.  Five times.  The rich man on the end is Fitzgerald.  Legend lifts on from the Chippewa  Down of the big lake they call  It's a game, man.  All right, we'll get back to Gorn life foot.  I just want to get a line where he says, 
[10:16:30]  A grandmother's wasted charm bracelet.  As grandma sadly looks at the bottle of Johnson's baby shampoo.  Unceremoniously dumps it in the toilet.  Because it's useless.  Because it's useless.  I'm the quack of a rubber ducky in the trash pile.  That is wrong.  You are the worst. 
[10:17:00]  You're the worst.  Holy Jesus.  This is hysterically awful.  Oh, my chest.  We'll see if we can get to the end of the song. 
[10:17:30]  Susan Smith sent the van down the boat ramp.  Two little tykes in their car seat.  She said,  You little cock blockers,  It's been nice to know you.  The big one said,  Mommy, why is we going backwards?  And she went on the news  and pointed that Coco had taken her children. 
[10:18:00]  Speaking of the song,  let's see where Gorn life foot is.  Oh, there it is. 
[10:18:30]  Fading out.  Wow, finally.  We made it to the end.  Thank God.  I got tears coming down my cheeks.  You're listening to  Opie and Anthony's  Best Bits Ever.

[10:21:00]  Opie!  Anthony!  And Norton, too!  Good times!  Great hits!  XM 202!  Suck my fucking cock!  The Opie and Anthony Show  has had a beef  with the Tony Danza Show  for quite some time.  And so we decided  to mess with them  a little bit  by sending interns  and employees  out to the line  waiting to get  into the Tony Danza Show 
[10:21:30]  and telling the eager fans  that they're about  to talk to Tony Danza  when really it was  just Anthony doing  his dead-on impression  of Tony Danza.  And things  got a little crazy.  It's ONA's Best Bits.  Hello!  Hello.  Who's this?  Nathaniel.  Oh, what's up, buddy?  What do you got?  I got Debra  and the Tony Danza line.  Oh, is she a big  Tony Danza fan?  Huge fan.  Alright.  Is she a fatty?  I'm sorry?  Is she a fatty?  Mmm, not really.  Okay.  Alright.  We'll talk to her. 
[10:22:00]  Alright.  Here you go.  Hello?  Hello, Debra.  Hi.  Hi, it's Tony Danza, Debra.  Hi, how are you, Tony?  Real good.  I hear you waiting  to get in on my show.  I can't wait.  You can't wait, huh?  Hey.  I'm here with my little friend Leslie  and it's her birthday today.  Leslie?  How old is she today?  Oh, I don't think she wants me  to tell you that.  Oh, come on.  How old are you today, Leslie?  She said 39.  39.  You need to be the judge.  Hey, happy birthday, huh?  Happy birthday. 
[10:22:30]  Happy birthday.  Hey, my thoughts and prayers  are with her on this fine birthday for her.  Tony, you know who I thought  you should have been for Halloween?  Who?  I thought you should have been Sammy Davis  because I watched the tape  when you did the tribute to Sammy Davis.  Remember your tap dance?  Oh, of course.  I love, I love hoofing like Sammy.  I know, but I thought  you should have been him for Halloween.  Well, I actually,  I went with the Spider-Man.  Did you see?  I didn't like that.  I didn't like it either.  I needed an apron to cover that up.  You know what I'm talking about, huh?  I know what you're talking about. 
[10:23:00]  Hey, Tony Danza junk  hanging out all over the place.  No, that was not for anybody to see.  No, not for public consumption, huh?  No, I don't like those outfits.  I needed a dressing room  just for my car.  I didn't hear you.  A bus just went by.  Yeah, the bus went by.  Good thing, huh?  Perfect timing, thank God.  So what do you like about my show?  I think you're very real.  I think you're very fresh.  I think you're just...  Wait till you see how fresh I can be.  Oh, no, no, no, no.  I think you're just,  you're very wonderful. 
[10:23:30]  You're gracious to your guests.  You're gracious to us  that are watching you at home.  Hey, thank you so much.  I want to tell you something, Debra.  We are gonna...  Do you know where you're sitting  for the audience?  No, I don't.  But we have VIP tickets,  so I don't know what that means.  My husband's friend got them for us.  Well, let me tell you what that means.  You are going to be in the front row,  and I'm going to come over  during the show and talk to you.  Okay.  You're going to be on television,  and I'm going to, you know,  talk a little bit about the news, 
[10:24:00]  maybe the election.  Who'd you vote for?  I didn't vote yet.  I'm voting after I leave you.  And who are you going to vote for?  I'm not quite sure.  How about vote for Tony?  You know?  All right.  Yeah.  Okay.  Would I be able to get a picture with you?  Oh, absolutely.  Okay.  I actually want to pull my mule out,  put it on your shoulder,  and take a picture like that.  Pull your what out?  My mule.  A newel?  A mule.  You know how I ride up on different things every time? 
[10:24:30]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm going to have a mule.  You know what I would rather you do?  A big mule right in your face.  My mule.  You know what I would rather you do  when you open the show?  I'd rather you open it up with a song.  Oh, you like when I sing?  I do.  I think you should do what you do best.  And what's that?  I have no clue.  When we were at Regis,  I bought my CV in,  and you said being I was the only person  that had your CV in the audience,  you came over and you signed it.  And I think that's how you should open the show, 
[10:25:00]  rather than do the silly stuff.  Oh, you don't like the silly stuff?  No, I like that you honored your father  when you came in on the garbage truck.  Hey, well, thoughts and prayers, you know?  Right.  I like everything that's sentimental and everything.  Yeah, sentimental.  Like my mule.  Like the stilts, you made me very nervous.  Oh, you didn't like the stilts?  It was kind of dangerous, wasn't it?  No, because...  Danger is my middle name.  Yeah, well, you have to be careful. 
[10:25:30]  Hello?  Hey, I'm so happy that you're coming on the show.  I am too.  Could you describe yourself  so I know what you look like  when I walk up to you?  Okay, I have blonde hair,  brown eyes,  I have on a...  Angela.  I have on, like, an argyle sweater,  black,  with different colors in it.  Yeah.  And I have my friend Leslie with me  and she has short blonde hair.  How many...  Well, what do you look like  as far as your body-wise  so I can distinguish you from other blondes? 
[10:26:00]  Oh, I'm pretty good.  Oh, you're hot, huh?  Yeah, I'm pretty good.  Yeah?  Hey, you know...  I have to hang up.  How would you like to go out with me tonight?  I would love to.  You want to go out with Tony?  I would love to.  Tony and my mule.  Okay.  Yeah?  Hey, do you take it up the ass?  Goodbye.  Hey, Debra.  Debra.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Enjoy the show.  Hello?  Hello? 
[10:26:30]  Nathaniel.  Yes, I am walking away fast.  What happened?  What happened at the end there?  She goes...  She looks at me and goes,  he was nasty at the end.  She still thinks it was Tony?  I think so.  Oh, God.  That was awful.  Yeah.  I'm so uncomfortable.  How is she going to look at him now  in that show?  All of a sudden,  she just gets up and belts him in the face  for no reason.  All right.  Great job, buddy. 
[10:27:00]  Thanks.  Try to find one more person  that wants to talk to Tony Danz, okay?  They're going in right now.  Oh, really?  That might be it for today.  All right, thank you.  You guys did a great job out there.  All right, thanks, man.  Oh, yes.  Oh, God.  You got it.  All right.  Oh, my God.  Take it off the end.  Poor woman.  Just crushed her image  of the man she loves.  There you have it.  Opie and Anthony's best bits.  Best Ramone promo.  Ramone!  Ramone! 
[10:27:30]  Ramone!  This is Reaper has eight.  Number two.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony.  Ooh, it's in my shoes.  Ramone, clean this up.  Eric?  Yeah, I'm here.  Hey, buddy.  Hey, I have a lady right here.  Not only is she a huge Tony Danza fan,  she was telling me  that she used to be on the Family Feud  back in when?  1993.  1993.  Did you score big?  We did pop shows  and we won over $18,000. 
[10:28:00]  They won over $18,000  on the Family Feud.  Wow.  That's wonderful.  Did you tell her  that we were thinking  about putting her  on the Tony Danza show today?  Yes, I did.  And they're all excited.  Her and her family  is right here.  They're just waiting  to speak to Tony.  All right, and where is she from?  I'm sorry, where are you from?  We are from New Jersey.  Of course.  They're from Surgeonsville, New Jersey.  All right, and what's her name?  Her name is Joan.  I'm going to give her the phone right now  and just get Tony ready 
[10:28:30]  and he'll have to speak to her.  Tony character.  All right, let's get Joan on the phone here.  Okay, here's Joan.  Is he here?  Yeah, he's right on the phone.  Hello, Tony.  Hey, Joan, how you doing?  I'm doing fine.  We can't wait to come inside  and see you in person.  Well, I can't wait  to have you on the show.  Thank you.  I mean, we watch it every day.  We love it.  I especially like the food, particularly.  Oh, you like the cooking segments?  I do.  I like the steamy-ass food segments. 
[10:29:00]  Well, you know,  I love to cook.  Being Italian, you know,  I cook a lot at home.  Uh-huh.  And my kids,  they get involved  and I think it's something  a lot of people like, you know?  Oh, you know what?  I have a great recipe  for spaghetti and clams,  the white sauce.  Spaghetti and clams,  that's my favorite.  Well, you know,  I'll send you the recipe.  You got a fantastic recipe for that?  Yeah, I'll send it to you.  You know something?  Hey, one day,  I would love to have you 
[10:29:30]  maybe come on the show  as, you know,  a listener cooking segment  or a viewer cooking segment.  Oops.  Oh, I'd love to.  I'd love to.  And we could have you cook  your special.  Wonderful.  Wonderful.  Actually, you know,  if you ever come over  to New Jersey,  you can come out  to Surgentsville.  We live way out  in the country  and it's a beautiful area  close to the Delaware River.  Oh, you have a nice place  out there?  Oh, yeah.  So, you know,  we'll cook your spaghetti  and clams first. 
[10:30:00]  You might as well taste it  before it's aired.  Yeah, I should taste it first.  I like taking a little taste  before I dip in,  you know what I mean?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Hey, how long  you been a fan?  You remember me  from Taxi?  I'm sorry, Tanya.  I couldn't understand that.  Hey, you remember me  from my old days  in Taxi?  Oh, absolutely.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  We've been following  your career.  You know,  I know that you do  shows in Atlantic City.  We're about two hours  away from Atlantic City. 
[10:30:30]  Oh, two hours.  So, you go there a lot?  Say that again?  So, you go to  Atlantic City a lot?  Oh, yes.  Oh, I love going there.  The gambling,  the wars, yeah.  Oh, it's wonderful.  It's wonderful.  You all get on the  big loser bus  and take that down there?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Fantastic.  It's great.  Are you going to be  in Atlantic City soon?  Well, yeah.  You know,  I got my album,  so I like to sing  and I go down there 
[10:31:00]  to Tropicana  and I get up there  and, you know,  I whine  and the rubes  give me money.  It's fantastic.  Oh, wonderful.  Wonderful.  Well, I have a cousin  who happens to own  a condo  right on Boardwalk  at the end  of the casinos  and it is just fabulous  to go and visit him.  That sounds fantastic.  Yes.  You know something?  What?  You sound like  a big Tony Danza fan.  I am the biggest  Tony Danza fan. 
[10:31:30]  So I want to do  something a little  special for you.  Oh, thank you, Tony.  Here it comes, kids.  Hold on to your hats.  Okay.  I need a little relaxation  before the show.  You know,  it's a stressful situation  being out there.  I'm kind of new  to the talk show thing.  You understand?  Yes.  So I'm thinking  I could use  a little company  in the dressing room.  Oh, my goodness.  How would you like  to come backstage  and hang out with me  while I get ready  for the show?  I would love it. 
[10:32:00]  I would love it to...  Do I bring my family?  Me.  Excuse me?  Just me  or do I bring  the three people  I came with?  Well, who do you  have with you?  My husband is here  and my two friends,  Karen and Phyllis.  Your husband's there?  Yes.  Well, that's fantastic.  Yeah.  Can you see  where this is going?  I can.  Now, I'd like you...  You know something?  Bring the whole family  with you. 
[10:32:30]  Oh, James.  Backstage  to hang out with me  before the show  because I need  to relax a little bit.  Okay.  Great.  That's great.  Well, you are just  so special to say that.  Thank you so very much.  I love being special  and you know  what relaxes me?  What's that?  I love to relax with you.  Strap in, kids.  You know what relaxes me backstage?  Excuse me?  You know what relaxes me  backstage in my dressing room?  Sure.  A nice fucking blowjob. 
[10:33:00]  Oh, my.  I'm sorry.  I missed that on the phone.  No, you didn't.  Tony likes having his hogs suck  before I gotta  placate to the rubes out there.  I would never use a word  like placate.  What am I, insane?  Before I entertain  all the rubes out there  in my audience,  I like blowing a load  on someone's face  and you seem like that person. 
[10:33:30]  Okay.  Should I give this phone  to Eric  so he knows what's going on?  You better give it to him  so he can run as fast  as he can  away from your husband  when you tell him the news  that you'll be backstage  sucking Tony Danza's cock.  Okay.  Fantastic.  I heard what you said.  I'm going backstage, Eric.  Okay.  Okay, here.  I'm going to give you to Eric  so you can tell him  what's going on. 
[10:34:00]  Fantastic.  Okay.  See you soon, Tony,  and thank you so much.  You certainly will.  All right.  We'll come back right out  and I'll have a...  Hey, run, Eric.  Run.  All right.  You got it?  Yeah, you can come home.  Wow.  Okay.  Well, I don't know.  Maybe...  Is she telling her husband  right now?  That what?  I'm sorry?  Is she telling her husband  right now?  Oh, my God.  They're jumping up and down.  I think she was so starstruck  she had no clue  that I...  what I was saying. 
[10:34:30]  Eric, ask her  if she understands  what's going on.  All right.  Hold on.  Let me move back  to moving the line  and hold on.  Oh, jeez.  Oh, you're going to kill me.  Jump.  I just wanted to answer.  Do you guys understand  what's going on  and everything, right?  About what he said?  About the backstage  and all that?  Just be there.  Just be there?  Yeah.  Yeah, she understands.  Does she...  Okay.  Does she understand  what she has to do  to Tony, though?  You understand  what you have to do  for Tony, right?  What?  She doesn't...  I was having trouble  hearing you.  She was having trouble  hearing.  She just said  to tell her 
[10:35:00]  if...  Again, what?  Do you want me  to tell you?  Yes.  All right.  What does Tony  want her to do?  I think that  Tony should tell her.  Maybe Tony should tell her.  Yeah, Tony should tell her.  Tony wants to tell her?  Okay.  Hold on.  Yeah.  Tony loves you.  You can't get enough of you.  Okay.  I'm going to try  to hear out here.  All right, Joan.  You listening?  Yeah, I'm listening.  Four.  Look, I need you  to come backstage  before the show  and give Tony  Danza, myself, 
[10:35:30]  some oral favors.  Some oral favors?  Is that what you said?  What did you say?  You heard me right, honey.  Party favors?  No, not party favors.  I need oral treats  before the show  to get me loosened up  and I pick a broad online  every day.  Eric finds a broad  that can give me  oral favors.  Eric is telling me  I have to blow out  those party saver things. 
[10:36:00]  No, he's saying  a blow job.  Yeah.  I know what you're saying.  I understand  what you're saying.  Do you get it now?  I get it now.  Joan Jones,  suck on my bone.  And you're not  going to do this  on television  saying that?  No, no, no.  The Tony Danza  on TV's got to be  all nice.  The one backstage  makes you choke.  She can't hear me 
[10:36:30]  right now.  She can't hear me  right now.  Get her to run  up on stage  during the show.  All righty.  All right.  There's two Tony Danzas.  Also,  I'm going to introduce  you during the show.  Okay.  So, actually,  I can't say your name.  That's all right.  But right after  I say  extravadanza,  I want you to  run up on stage  and join me.  Oh, my goodness.  Absolutely.  I need a big hug  from you.  Okay.  Right after I say 
[10:37:00]  extravadanza  in the audience,  everyone yells it out  for the big prize money.  Yes.  And I'm going to  present you  with $10,000  for helping me out.  Oh, you're kidding.  So, all you got to do  right after  extravadanza.  I run up just as though,  I mean,  no one introduces me,  so I just look like  No, you're going to  look like a crazed fan,  but I'm going to  put my arms around you.  I'm going to introduce  you to the crowd.  Okay.  And, you know,  it's for, you know,  Disney, the Visa,  and extravadanza. 
[10:37:30]  Okay.  I can do that.  And don't, you know,  you can tell your family  and stuff,  but we want to keep it  secret from the audience.  Okay.  Okay.  That's it.  All right, Joan.  I will not be shy.  And I'll see you  right after the show.  Okay.  Thank you, Tony.  Take care.  Thank you, Joan.  It's my pleasure.  No, my pleasure.  Okay.  I'm going to give it to Eric.  Give the phone to Eric.  Okay.  All right, Eric.  Here's the deal.  You got to, like, 
[10:38:00]  convince her.  So, tell her,  you know what you have to do  when Tony says  extravaganza.  Extravaganza.  Sorry.  Extravaganza.  She has to run from the crowd  and run on stage  and hug Tony.  And if she does that,  she gets $10,000,  but she can't tell anyone  it's happening.  She's got to wait five seconds  for the graphics to show.  She's got to wait five seconds.  Well, no,  by the time she gets up there.  Oh, okay.  Okay.  Yeah.  All right?  Yeah, it'll be crazy.  Okay.  Eric, try to sell that,  all right?  And then get out of there.  All right.  Be as serious as possible,  and no one is supposed to know. 
[10:38:30]  Tell her.  Okay.  That's a new bit.  But don't make it like  too much of a secret  where she's going to be on to it.  Just reinforce what I said.  All right.  All right.  And Tony approved this, right?  Of course Tony did.  Yeah.  Of course.  All right?  Okay.  All right.  They're just reiterating to me,  you know what to do  during the extravaganza  when the graphic comes up?  Because he loves giving it  out of the way  other people's money.  You know that, right?  So when he does extravaganza,  the graphics go up  and she's up there  doing the Plinko thing,  you know what to do, right?  You go up there  and give them,  and Tony's cool with it? 
[10:39:00]  And she's all excited.  All right.  Great.  Okay.  All right.  Thank you, Eric.  All right.  You go inside and warm up  and you have a good time  with the show,  and we're going to get you  backstage, all right?  Okay.  We're good.  All right.  Thank you, Eric.  We'll see you in a little while.  Bye.  Holy ass.  Oh, if I'm watching that later  and this broad does this,  I'm going to crap myself.  That's just too easy.  I will crap myself.  They just are so thrilled to death  that they are talking  with Tony Danza  that he can say anything  to these people. 
[10:39:30]  Anything.  All right.  Oh, that was so funny.  Oh, please, God.  Let that work.  Greg from Bloomfield.  Oh, man.  You jerk-offs are going to force me  to watch that fucking  Tony Danza show now.  Well, I hope it works.  It's an experiment.  We'll see.  It will eventually.  Eventually, it will work.  Absolutely.  If we have to send the intern out  with a Tony Danza shirt,  we have to have  a Tony Danza shirt made.  Who doesn't want one?  Well, you know,  I'd like one, too.  One with him in a Spider-Man suit  with that luscious hog. 
[10:40:00]  That was fun.  All right.  Well, wrap in.  That was great, dude.  Here it comes.  That was really good.  Another successful  Tony Danza phone call.  Can't lose.  They love Tony.  Opie and Anthony's  best bits.  Most bestest sweeper.  You're listening  to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Number two.  Hey, what's that?  Have you never seen it before?  Looks like a rock.  New from Sedentary Toys  and the Opie and Anthony show.  Oh, it's so shiny.  It's got corners.  It's the cool new toy 
[10:40:30]  that has everyone  jumping for joy.  O&A Party Rock.  It's not just any rock.  It's the O&A Party Rock.  The O&A Party Rock  is incredibly versatile.  You can chuck it.  You can fuck it.  You can drop it  in a bucket.  You can race it.  You can chase it.  You can yell right in its face.  It's the bestest friend  you'll ever have.  O&A Party Rock.  Why is it wearing  a party hat?  Every Party Rock  comes dressed in  a colorful party hat  and party blower,  making it the centerpiece  of any party.  Now with shiny red  dancing shoes.  Not only that,  the O&A Party Rock 
[10:41:00]  is...  is...  is...  is...  is a fucking rock,  you dildo.  All right,  a little surprise  for everybody.  Haven't done this  in a while.  Right?  No, we haven't.  And we can't tell you  what it is  because we want  to get it done  before anyone  gets in trouble,  right?  We've done it in the past.  So let's go to  Sex Bagel  out on the streets  of New York City.  Sex Bagel!  Hey, guys.  I'm out here  in the cold,  pouring rain  with a bunch  of Tony Danza fans here.  We have Tina  from Philadelphia  who is a massive 
[10:41:30]  Tony Danza fan  and she would love  nothing more  to speak to Tony.  Oh, that's wonderful.  All right.  I think Tony Danza  is ready here.  Hello?  Hello?  I think we're ready  for Tina.  Okay, hang on  one second.  Okay.  Here you go.  Hello? 
[10:42:00]  Tina.  Hi, Tony.  How are you?  Hey, how you doing, Tina?  Good.  We love you so much.  There's eight of us.  You came all the way  from Philadelphia  to see you.  Philadelphia.  Hey, you know,  I'm doing very well  in Philadelphia.  That's great.  The show,  it taking off.  I am getting married.  I am so very excited.  I went to hear your CD.  I wanted to purchase one.  Oh, you like that?  Yes.  Yeah, well,  I've loved singing  for so many years  and, you know,  God bless.  I've been able  to pursue that now 
[10:42:30]  and put out a CD.  Oh, that's great.  I was a big fan  of Who's the Boss?  Oh, Who's the Boss?  And, of course,  that other show  I was on.  But I still love you.  You're still a hottie.  Oh, does that mean  Tony might get lucky?  Yeah.  I can't wait  to meet you.  Oh, you can't wait  to come into the show  and see.  How do you think  I'm doing  as a talk show host?  Huh?  How do you think 
[10:43:00]  I'm doing  as a talk show host?  Oh, you're doing good.  You're doing great.  Yeah, I don't look  like a complete buffoon  up there.  No, not at all.  Not at all.  You know,  because I'm pretty stupid.  Not at all.  But you're funny.  You're funny.  It's a great show.  Hey, you watch  the reruns of Taxi?  Huh?  You watch  the reruns of Taxi?  Yes, I do.  Yes, I do.  When I was a young guy,  you know,  my mule was all hard.  Yeah, definitely.  And that little guy  with the...

Right.  You know, you understand that, right?  Oh, I completely understand it.  Yeah, so how long before they let you in?  I don't know.  We're still waiting.  Hey, do you know who's on the show today? 
[10:45:00]  No.  Uh-oh.  I was hoping you'd tell me, because they don't tell me until the last minute.  Oh, really?  Oh, my God.  Yeah, we all know who's on the show today.  Hey, how big of a Tony Danza fan are you?  I'm a big fan.  A big, big fan?  I'm a huge fan.  We're all huge fans.  We have eight people.  Yeah.  Um, what's got your CD?  Excuse me?  Could you give me a CD?  I will personally give you a CD after the show. 
[10:45:30]  As a matter of fact, if you let my person on the scene there, Eric, know where you're  sitting, how would you like to come backstage after the show and hang out with Tony?  I would love it.  I have eight people with me.  Can they come, too?  They could all come backstage.  That would be awesome.  But, you know, there's a little trade-off here.  Okay.  A little trade-off, I do for you, you do for Tony Danza. 
[10:46:00]  All right?  Do you understand?  I completely understand.  We love him.  Hello?  Here we go again.  Hello?  Do you know the kind of favor Tony needs?  You know, it's pretty, a lot of high pressure doing a show every day like this.  You understand?  Oh, I completely understand.  And I need to relax a little bit.  You know, I need to relax. 
[10:46:30]  I used to have to relax on a set of taxi and who's the boss.  And there were people that would help me relax.  Maybe you could help me relax a little bit is what I'm saying.  I'll help you relax.  You know, maybe a little back rub.  Definitely.  Would you like to give me a back rub?  I sure will.  Hey, maybe a little front rub.  Oh, my God.  Are you married?  Yeah, I'm getting married in March.  Yeah, well, I'll try to put a stop to that, huh?  Hey, you keep your husband happy, huh? 
[10:47:00]  Yes.  Definitely.  Hey, you want to do me a favor?  Sure.  When I'm doing my monologue at the beginning of the show, would you come up on stage and  give me a kiss?  Oh, I sure will.  I would love it.  You know, I'm starting a new segment on the program, and I like having a lovely young lady  come out on stage and give me a little peck on the cheek. 
[10:47:30]  I would be honored to.  I would definitely be honored to.  Now, we need a good time for you to come out.  Okay.  And give me that little kiss on the cheek.  Okay, definitely.  Now, as soon as I walk out.  Okay.  I'll walk out on the stage.  Okay.  And I want you to, you know, the audience is applauding because I'm Tony Danza.  Uh-huh. 
[10:48:00]  And you come out, and I'll be like, oh, here's someone from the crowd.  And just say, I love you, Tony, and give me a kiss on the cheek.  Oh, that'd be awesome.  And then you go back to your seat, and I'll give you a CD, and you come back and give me  a massage.  Thank you very much.  Absolutely.  I'm so excited.  And so am I.  Thank you.  I won't ruin it by saying anything else.  All right.  I look forward to seeing you on stage at the beginning of the show.  I sure will. 
[10:48:30]  Thank you.  Hey, thank you very much.  God bless.  Thank you very much.  God bless you, too.  Bye-bye.  Hey, guys.  Eric.  Hey, we have the head of security here.  He's right next to me.  He wants to confirm that this isn't the Opie and Anthony show, that it's really Z-100.  Yeah, sure.  Okay.  Hang on one second.  All right.  We have somebody from the company who wants to, if you want to confirm it.  Oh, it didn't happen there.  Uh-oh. 
[10:49:00]  Well, it sounds like somebody's on to this oop shenanigan.  I knew it.  I knew it was too good to be true.  Someone from the show knows the deal now.  That stinks.  Oh.  Well, I'm still going to have to watch today, and hopefully they won't talk to that woman.  Yeah, they'll talk right to her.  Do you think?  Yeah.  There's another will get it done.  I don't know.  Maybe Eric kept her away from the girl I was talking to.  Who knows?  I don't know.  Boy, they always think it's Tony. 
[10:49:30]  They're so happy to talk to that.  Your impression's phenomenal, though.  I think it's Tony, and I'm looking at you.  Big dumb ass.  Eric's all nervous.  He's down there in his fake Tony Danza t-shirt.  Is he wearing a fake Tony Danza t-shirt?  Yeah, he went down there with it.  We actually had t-shirts made up.  Let's say Tony Danza Show staff.  Yeah.  We got, like, Tony Danza staff t-shirt, a jacket, a hat.  He's just, oh, yeah.  We go all out for our bits. 
[10:50:00]  We do it enough.  One of these days, it's going to happen.  They're probably making an announcement before the show.  If Tony spoke with you, look, if Tony Danza spoke with you on the phone,  don't come running out on the stage, okay?  You fucking roonks.  Come out and give me a kiss on my car.  Duh.  Oh, wow.  Oh, she was very happy to talk with Tony.  Yeah, sure.  May have to just be vicious from now on, then. 
[10:50:30]  If it's never going to get on stage, you may just have to keep smashing them with filth.  I know.  You know what's really funny?  She doesn't...  I'm talking to her, and I bring up that Dr. Phil said, you know,  if you give something up, you've got to replace it with something.  You understand?  And she's like, oh, yeah, yeah.  Like, she's just so thrilled to talk with this idiot  that she doesn't care what he's saying.  She's just agreeing with it.  She's just agreeing with anything.  We're trying to get Eric back on the line, but...  Hey, where'd he go?  Ben's laughing.  Ben, you can come back in. 
[10:51:00]  The boss thing's over.  Jesus.  Why is Ben cackling?  I don't know, but he's got something to say.  He's in an outbreak suit, Ben.  He's just afraid.  He's being, uh...  They're threatening to arrest him.  What?  Disorderly conduct.  How is that disorderly conduct?  He's the most orderly guy ever.  Then they grabbed his phone or something.  They grabbed his phone.  Grabbed his phone.  That's great.  What?  Is this going to be the first person arrested on the new Opie and Anthony show?  Eric.  Why can't I fucking do it? 
[10:51:30]  Hello?  Hey, what's up, Eric?  Eric.  Yeah, they're not letting me leave.  They're threatening to arrest me here for disorderly contact and ruining their show.  Eric, run away.  They're not cops.  Leave right now.  Run.  Hello?  Oh, they got it again.  Just run away.  He's got to just run.  They don't understand.  People don't understand.  If they're not cops, you can flee.  Yeah.  Run away.  Well, Eric's going to get arrested now.  Eric's going to get arrested because he's not running away.  Like stupid Mercurio. 
[10:52:00]  Run away.  Run.  Run.  They're not cops.  You can run from Danza security.  They're not going to put an APB.  Hey, call in all cars.  Call in all cars.  Look for a cute little chubby boy with frosted hair.  Car 54, where are you?  Whoa.  It's the Danza police.  The Danza police.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  Are you kidding me?  I thought we were pretty sneaky today.  They've been just waiting for us, huh? 
[10:52:30]  Pull over.  Who's the boss?  I'm the boss.  Don't make a move.  Drop the cell phone.  Well, someone has to get down there.  Oh, he's got to run.  I'll give Ben all the numbers for the record label guy.  So I'll go down there.  Disturb.  What is it?  Disorderly conduct?  That was the most orderly call ever.  Danny's good.  Danny, go run down there with a cell phone.  Don't get caught and tell us what the hell's going on.  Because they took us.  Oh, wait.  Is he back?  Who's this?  Hey, it's Eric. 
[10:53:00]  All right.  Eric.  What's going on?  The guy keeps taking the fuck, smacking the phone out of my hand and closing.  He's like, I won't give a fuck who you're talking to.  He's like, if you, and he's sitting here trying to take my picture and everything.  Just walk away, stupid.  I'm not, I've been trying to, but the guy won't let me fucking keep you getting me, girl.  What, is he holding on to you?  Yeah.  He's not allowed to hold you.  That's assault.  Punch him in the face.  Punch him in the frigging nuts.  Do you have an idea for you?  I said, no, I just took a cab here.  And he said, well, how much you want to bet if I go through you, you got a lot.  I said, you can't go through me.  I said, I don't know who the fuck you are. 
[10:53:30]  You're not a cop.  He's not a cop.  Run.  Run away.  I'm trying to.  Break loose and run.  Break loose.  Break loose.  Use one of those.  Unbelievable.  Use a master phone.  Data security can't tell him not to be on the phone.  Or say can.  And you can talk to anybody online.  Is our guy going to get arrested with a fake Tony Danza?  You can talk to anybody online with a phone.  You don't want to be at the tombs with a Tony Danza.  It's a show t-shirt on. 
[10:54:00]  All right.  Well, hey, my thoughts and prayers are with Eric.  Danny can handle this because we need you for the next segment.  Can Danny handle this, though, or should Steve go?  No, Danny can handle this.  He's good.  Just tell Danny to run there with the phone.  All right.  All right.  I got Steve's strategy.  Steve will go there.  They'll be upset.  Pull the fire alarms because they'll see a blade.  And he'll be able to make good his escape.  Yeah, you weren't in Chicago overnight, were you?  No, no.  I saw some of your clothes flying out a window.  Doing a little office work at night, were you?  How can this head of security smack his phone? 
[10:54:30]  Who the fuck is this guy?  Tony Danza security.  He's a bully.  That's all he is.  He's intimidating.  He's probably, he's huge.  I bet you he's a huge black guy that just thinks he can intimidate the shit out of Eric.  And Eric's scared.  Wow.  Send me after Poe.  Yeah, exactly.  You know what?  We really should.  We should send Poe down there.  Send Poe down there.  Oh.  Spin kick the sun.  Go in and just kick ass on the Danza set.  No, but you know what?  If Eric is going to be hassled physically, you can't have that.  It can't happen to him.  No.  The guy could be arrested for assault right there, just holding him.  Yeah, he's grabbing him.  Just grabbing him.  He's going to be knocking the cell phone out of his head. 
[10:55:00]  Absolutely not.  You're allowed to go online and interview or talk to anybody you want.  There's no security guy on a sidewalk.  Well, what is it?  Can better somebody get Billy Mac on one of those guys on the phone?  Billy Mac.  Billy Mac.  Master Poe.  What's wrong?  Eric's in trouble?  Yeah, one of our guys is in trouble.  Yeah.  No bullshit.  He's on line with Tony Gagher thing.  He's getting arrested.  The head of security won't...  He was just on the phone.  He wasn't doing anything.  And the head of security is like...  Like every time he tried to call the show, the head of security won't let him go. 
[10:55:30]  He keeps smacking his phone.  What exactly did he do?  On the phone.  Just with the phone, like interviewing somebody on the line.  Okay.  This just in?  He got away?  Yes.  Okay.  Oh, good.  Of course.  Is he running?  Yeah, he's running.  I just told him I'm running in the middle of traffic.  That's how he's running.  Just so you could lose him.  What did they do to him?  Oh, I don't know.  Nothing now.  They knocked a cell phone out of his hand.  Right?  We'll get the phone.  Or when Eric gets back here.  Get in contact with Keith.  You can't do that.  Bodily holding him.  No, you can't do that.  That's against the law.  You can't smack anything out of anyone. 
[10:56:00]  When Sex Bagel gets back, we'll find out exactly what happened.  Dude, I really think that if he smacked the phone out of his hand, Eric should file a report.  Exactly.  There's nothing illegal about interviewing somebody on a line.  Of course not.  Why do we have to deal with cops again?  Twice already?  It's not against the law.  No.  Eric's not a disorderly guy.  It's not against the law.  Maybe he can get free tickets for Tony.  And he's a nice guy.  He did nothing.  Oh my God.  Master Poe's going to lose his mind.  Look at him.  Breathe.  He's taking the legal road.  Breathe.  Thoughts and prayers, Poe. 
[10:56:30]  Breathe.  We got to get some boards in here that you can break when you just get pissed off.  We should contact Keith because honestly...  Well, we'll find out as soon as Eric gets here.  That's wrong.  Yeah.  It's wrong.  I hope he's ditching the Tony Danza t-shirt where Master Poe ditched the bloody gee.  The bloody gee in a dumpster.  That'd work.  Ditch the evidence.  Eric, if you're listening to us, ditch the evidence.  How is he listening to you?  He doesn't have...  He doesn't smell.  He has a Wi-Fi.  I don't know.  All right.  Well, we'll find out what happens when he gets here, okay?  Okay.  All right, Poe.  Breathe.  Breathe for us, okay?  Poe's very pissed off. 
[10:57:00]  Eric running down the street.  Cure Mom's fault!  All right, he got the word in.  Great.  Man, they've been waiting for us.  We've been wondering.  We were being set up.  We were being lulled into a false sense of security.  You heard how sneaky we were.  We didn't tell anyone.  We just went to it real fast.  Because they're with the dopey shirt on.  You know that pissed them off.  Man, it's not illegal.  You can wear whatever the hell you want.  It's the Tony Danza shirt.  But why they ask if you were the other radio station?  I guess it's okay if Z100 does it, but not us.  Because Z100 isn't going to say things like Tony needs his cock sucked. 
[10:57:30]  I think it might have been, from what I was gathering there,  they think Eric was saying he was with the Opie and Anthony show,  but he was really with Z100,  so they wanted to know who was really at the bottom of this  so they could get them in trouble.  So they were trying to get Z100 in trouble, thinking it was Z100.  That's what I think.  There you go.  You don't?  You know?  I don't think they have a relationship with the Z100.  I think they thought Eric was lying and saying it was Opie and Anthony. 
[10:58:00]  I think Eric panicked and said, I'm with Z100.  Oh, you think Eric did that?  Of course he did.  Or a misrepresentation of himself?  Would you say you were with Opie and Anthony on the line?  He probably just went, they probably went, who are you here with?  You know, some...  Oh, Z100.  Yeah, he does do that to get out of trouble sometimes.  Oh, yeah, and he figures out what's the faggiest radio station,  so maybe they'll have, you know, some sympathy for me.  It's Opie and Anthony's best sandwiches.  I mean, bits.  Best bits ever.  It's Opie and Anthony's best bits ever. 
[10:58:30]  There's more of it, so don't go and play any games.  I'm not allowed to be alone.  Hey, do you or one of your loved ones have dyslexia?  Barely earned that high school diploma, did you?

I like you guys, and I like what Satellite Radio is doing a lot. 
[11:01:00]  Yeah.  I like what you guys are doing.  It's a lot of fun being able to do whatever the hell you want.  You could say Schmegma and then...  Oh, that's the one thing you can't say.  Oh, no.  So we have to dump out of that.  How about Taint?  You could talk about Taint?  Taint.  That's the only thing you can say.  See, the feedback is going crazy on the phones.  Everyone is amazed that you're so dirty, Bob.  Well, they can go fuck themselves.  I've always been like this.  30 years of it.  I've always...  Well, now you got the gig on the show, on Full House.  I had to get a job.  I had a new kid, and my ex-wife almost died while I was fucking her. 
[11:01:30]  No, when she gave birth.  When she gave birth.  We've had a lot of death and stuff.  I have two dead sisters and shit.  Jesus.  Two dead sisters.  Well, Jesus died, too, and I'm not responsible for murdering.  I didn't know the cross was that.  Well, he's there, but then didn't stay dead.  That's the beauty of it.  That's what I hear, but I don't know.  It's not on the Thomas Guide, exactly.  It's a zombie.  But you must not have known.  I think they're on Aruba.  They never found a body.  No.  She's hot, by the way.  Yes.  What's up with this?  Nothing.  Well, she was hot.  Yeah.  She might be.  You never know where it is. 
[11:02:00]  We've made...  Let me tell you where the line isn't on this show.  Okay.  We've made light of Adam Walsh's head.  Ah.  So, I really don't...  Even Bob Saget is shit.  Well, I'm just trying to give you a ballpark here.  It's wide open.  I was on CNN yesterday.  Yeah.  Penn Jillette was being the director and Penn Jillette of the aristocrats.  And I was...  They were putting us on showbiz tonight.  And they had 45 minutes of Peter Jennings instead.  We love Peter Jennings.  What a great man.  What a great man. 
[11:02:30]  And now, Bob Saget from the aristocrats.  Oh, hey.  Be funny.  And I'm like, this is a movie about incest and shitting and pissing on each other.  Yeah.  Where does that fall into the tribute?  And so, Penn Jillette's on in Vegas.  And he's all happy because he's just, like, cursing through the IFB before we go on.  You sitting there with an asshole, Bob?  And I'm like, Peter Jennings is dead, dude.  So, it's a good story.  I'm very relieved to be here where I could talk about this.  Yes.  What is that sound?  I'm hearing something that sounds like a record.  He gave me fucking Engelbert Humperdinck's mic. 
[11:03:00]  It's a wireless mic, and we didn't have batteries for it.  They had to charge him really fast.  It sounded like...  So, his wireless mic is going to crap out within 10 minutes.  Oh, that's wonderful.  I don't care.  I'll share with Jim Norton.  I know where his mouth has been.  Sorry if it smells like bleach.  Your mic smells like my cock.  You want to take a call?  I'll talk to somebody.  I got to say, too, the first time I realized that Bob was really dirty was at half the  half-baked.  Everybody was shocked.  I think the line was something about sucking cocks for coke. 
[11:03:30]  Yeah, I sucked dick for coke.  Yeah.  And the fucking place went crazy.  It was the biggest laugh in the film, because nobody expected that to come out of your mouth.  I got honored at Harvard on the basis of that.  Really?  At the Harvard Lampoon and Sanders Theater and 1,200 people.  And they lower a screen, 35-millimeter projection, and run the clip.  And then I did stand-up for like 30 minutes.  They went nuts.  Then I went, oh, these are my people.  So, then I started doing stand-up a lot more for theaters.  Some people don't understand.  It's a fucking part.  You played, and when that cheesy music starts up, and you're giving your little lesson 
[11:04:00]  to one of the daughters or something.  You know what?  Michelle, it's really not good to jack off a horse.  But he's in the living room, Dad.  Ah, you got a point.  I've been blowing the dog.  You know what it is, though?  It's, and I don't blame people.  It was a good show for what it is.  You know, the show's made for 12-year-old girls.  It's a family little show.  There's nothing fucking wrong with that.  You got a 12-year-old at home, you don't want them listening to shit like this and talking  about fucking dogs and shit.  Had a little Uncle Jesse on there.  Had a little mullet.  He had his mullet. 
[11:04:30]  Had a little mullet head.  Dave Coulier shaved his balls, which he did.  He had the Sting haircut.  The reverse Sting Phil Collins.  Whatever, the Emperor's Ball haircut.  All right.  Go ahead.  Sorry.  Yeah, no worries.  Let's go to the phones.  John, what's up?  Hey, Bob, I've got a question, man.  I saw Dave Coulier perform in my school, and he is a complete hack.  Oh, don't say that about him.  He shaves his balls.  Yeah, but I mean, I don't know.  It was just, he's doing Rocky and Bullwinkle impressions on stage, and I hear you in, like, 
[11:05:00]  these movies, and I don't know, man.  Well, I'm not doing that.  I'll do it if I'm fucking Rocky.  Well, Dave is...  Here's something you're really like.  Oh, my God.  Bullwinkle, let go of my nuts.  You know, I just, he's a funny, funny guy.  Sometimes I think maybe he chose the wrong material for a college audience.  Maybe, is that what it is?  That's a good one.  Boy, that's diplomatic of you.  I love, Dave's one of my dear friends.  Yeah, of course.  It's hard, you know.  Yeah, no, no, and the thing is, too, we...  You just laugh about your bank accounts from that show, Falthy is.  Just look and show each other, like me, and over here. 
[11:05:30]  Ah, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Did you guys do that?  Ah, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Why don't you tell those jokes?  Look at this, fucker.  Enjoy your pickup.  Look at this.  It's huge.  No, but I hear you.  But was he funny at all for you?  Ah, we got rid of him there.  Oh, God.  Sorry about that.  I'm sorry.  Too late.  Steve in New Mexico.  Steve?  Hey, what's up, guys?  He throws your buddy under a bus and then leaves.  Steve?  Yeah, Steve, go.  Bob, listening to you is like fucking listening to South Park the first time I watched the movie, 
[11:06:00]  and they come out of that theater and just start cussing up and stug with the funniest shit  I ever heard, man.  Oh, that's a big compliment.  Thank you, man.  Yeah, my stand-up's kind of like that.  The aristocrat's too dirty.  The aristocrat's like X-rated her.  Or NC-70.  My stand-up, I had to say fuck a bunch and talk about fucking people's daughters.  Nothing too dirty.  Well, you did Entourage a couple weeks ago.  Yeah.  Playing yourself.  Smoking a bong and banging hookers.  That's life.  I had to show that to my real children just so they know because that's real popular.  Their friends all watch that shit.  I love Entourage. 
[11:06:30]  So I have an 18, 15, and a 12-year-old daughter, and I'm fucking all their friends, and that's  not true.  Oh, my God.  And that's not true.  It's just a couple of them.  I'm not fucking their friends.  My 12-year-old, come on.  They haven't even reached their chair yet.  Let's go to Larry in New Jersey.  Larry.  We're going to hell.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, man.  Rana Fenn.  Glad to have you back.  Cool.  Bob, I have the opposite thing where it's like everyone's like, oh, my God, you have  Danny Tanner from Full House, and now he's talking about Chuck and Horse Cops.  But the other way around, you're on the Young Comedian special. 
[11:07:00]  Yeah, with Rodney.  And you talk about a seven-year-old giving you a blowjob.  Next thing I see you on Full House, I'm like, whoa.  Right.  Why did he do that?  Yeah.  What was with his business?  Well, here's the deal.  I had a job in New York.  First thing I did was a Richard Pryor movie called Critical Condition.  His first job I got after nine years of trying to get a job.  And then I got to say, fuck in that.  It was an R-rated movie.  And I got to work with Richard Pryor for a month.  So that's like the shit.  And then before that, Rodney Dangerfield mentored me and put me on his Young Comedian  show with Scam Kennison and Louie Anderson and Rita Rudner and all that, those people. 
[11:07:30]  And then I got a job on the CBS Morning program here in New York, and I got fired after five  months.  And you know what it's like.  I got fired, fired.  I got, I had a hosting chair on CBS, on the, you know, against Today Show, and I got there  one morning and they, and the chair was gone.  And they went, and they went, we'll try to get your chair back.  And so I got a phone call that they wanted to recast the guy in full house.  And I said, yeah, I mean, I would have fucking signed, I'd have been eating horse shit out 
[11:08:00]  of a guy in the park, you know, out of a man's ass with horse shit coming out of him.  And so I went, I just had a baby here at Lenox Hill, I went to L.A., did full house, I don't  know, I said, Felix Unger, I'll hug, you know, I'll be clean, I'll be a neat freak.  I love how he's got to explain the fact that he's on a huge hit show making massive amounts  Yeah, but I had a bouffant hairdo, and I was like the gayest guy that ever lived.  And then I did a video show with those jokes from my grandmother's ass.  Right, yeah, that's right.  You're on two huge, two huge shows.  Giant hit, and the jokes traveled around the world, but they wouldn't have if I talked like 
[11:08:30]  my stand-up, because here's a guy getting hit in the dick, enjoy your meal, you know.  Here's an old man getting killed by shrapnel, fuck you.  You know, you can't do that.  So the answer is, you're right.  Watch his cunt get petrified as this man jumps out of a cake.  And the winner is, big fat cunt.  But, who will it be?  But, that was Ernie Anderson, he died of cancer.  He was P.T. Anderson's dad.  Really?  True thing.  True dad.  What a happy story.  Lovely, enjoy it.  Bring it up, have your cereal.  All right, that's good.  You still got on a plane with him.  Yeah, no, really. 
[11:09:00]  That guy just asked a question, or made a comment, and I talked for seven minutes.  That's fine.  How many years was Full House on?  Eight.  Jesus.  Let's go to Tennessee.  Dave, what's up?  Hey, I wanted to ask Bob Saget, when you hosted that show, America's Funniest Home Video,  was that your material, or was that written?  Because I'm telling you, I thought you were garbage, but now sitting here listening to you  speak, I think you're pretty cool, man.  Well, thank you.  Was that your material, or what?  It was, this is the truth, I'll just say the truth, it was written by two skinheads.  No, it was written by two friends of mine that are Canadian, that's why, there was 
[11:09:30]  like an 18% exchange rate on the joke, but it was, and myself, I did, I did, we wrote  55 pages a week.  What I thought I did okay on there was writing the voiceovers to the animals, and I did those  voices, the real shitty ones, like, oh, look out, my balls.  Oh, I remember that.  That was a cat.  Yes, sir, I accept, that was the cat and the squirrel, and the goose, and the fucking.  Here I am, chasing my tail, chasing my tail.  Oh, Pooch and a Rock, Pooch and a Rock, Pooch and a Rock. 
[11:10:00]  But, sir, Pooch and a Rock is famous.  But, sir, I feel your pain, because I felt it much more, but there's no, I was doing network  TV, and it was either quit the show, which is my option, or try to somehow feed the box,  which is the lowest common denominator, and the show traveled to, like, Spain.  It was like third world, and it went to people that don't even have lives, and in Lebanon,  they told me they stopped the war to watch this show.  That's what, fucking dumb war, if you're going to fight a war and stop it from America's 
[11:10:30]  funny.  So, I agree, sir.  I felt the same way about my show.  Pushing a Rock.  Blowing it up.  Blowing it up.  Putting it back.  But, sorry, sorry, man.  I don't know what to say.  Putting a Jew.  Blowing up a Jew.  Eating some flan.  What the fuck's he got flan for?  But, I...  It's still around.  What?  Why aren't you with the show anymore?  It's still there.  Oh, it's ten years.  No, they offered me to stay if I would take, like, a third pay cut.  Wow.  And I said, that is an attractive offer. 
[11:11:00]  You really mulled that over.  And we don't want you to write it.  Oh, that's...  Well, I don't blame you on that, but still, no.  So, it was...  I wanted to do acting and directing, and I directed some stuff for a few years that didn't become  a hit, like Dirty Work, which is kind of a cult movie.  It's Norm MacDonald's, Chris Farley's last movie.  Would have put Jim in it.  Yeah.  I should have put Jim in it.  You got fucked.  Thank you.  Wait, what happened?  You were supposed to be in that movie?  No.  Well, we talked about you, though.  Did you?  Yeah, we did.  Swear to God.  Oh, wow. 
[11:11:30]  See that?  You didn't even know.  No.  But, uh...  Oh, that's gonna kill me today.  Well, I was going...  When I saw Bob at Caroline's, the first time I met him, like, a week ago, after the  Aristocrats party, I'm like, I'm gonna go over and see Saget and get a picture with him,  because I have my camera.  And it's weird, because he starts going, is that Jim Norton?  Jim, get him over here.  I was like, fuck.  I got all the Adam Dubin movies.  I've seen all your fun, dirty shit.  Yeah, the side splitters.  I laugh at you.  The gynecologists.  Gynecologists, yeah.  American Dummy.  I love American Dummy.  American Dummy.  That's Otto and George.  Yeah.  He's got it all together.  Okay, then. 
[11:12:00]  American Cock.  The weirdest thing for me is that compliment, which is, I always hated you and wanted you  dead.  Now I like you.  It's like, let me just clear my memory on the thing that I am hated.  Actually, I get...  That sums up our show right there.  I get it a lot.  That's okay, man.  You know, if people want to do over and let me...  I'm funny.  The only thing I'm confident in is I know I'm funny.  That's the only thing I'm confident in.  The rest of it, I can fucking...  I can't figure nothing out of it.  Do you ever think of doing a DVD and narrating over it, like with stuff that you could do, 
[11:12:30]  like the Rodney King beating, the original...  They made it.  They made it.  Did they really?  They took clips from the video show and faces of death, and they intercut them, and I've  seen it.  They sent it to me, and it's me going, here's something that happens around the house.  And they got the senator that blows his brains out, and they put Zabruder on it, and they  put the shuttle on it, and I stopped.  At first, I laughed, and people in the audience throwing their heads back and shit, and then  I stopped laughing because I can't watch Snuff.  I just can't watch it.  I don't like that either. 
[11:13:00]  I can make it, but I can't watch it.  This stuff's just one take, and you're out, you know?  You don't know how to reshoot.  There's no coverage.  No cast party at the end.  Right?  It's just me and a bottle of George Dickel.  I always hated you, but now I want myself to yourself.  Opie and Anthony's Best Bits.  Best Drew Boogie Remix.  Ooh.  Number two.  Oh, you know, I'm starting to get hot.

I enjoy having sex with a guy.  I enjoy something in my mouth.  I enjoy cock between the boobs.  I enjoy cock in my tight ass.  Patty, Patty, Patty.  That's what they call me.  Patty, Patty, Patty.

Opie and Anthony's best bits.  Best Drew Boogie remix.  Ooh.  Let's see how this comes out.  All right.  They're right there. 
[11:20:00]  All right, here we go.  I got a break.  I got a break.  I got a break.  I got a break.  I got a break.  This is a story about a man.  And he always was so lonely at night.  But his voice was rowdy.  You could hear it all through his train station.  And I'm going to sing this one.  This is about Tiffy Toe Tommy.  Let's go.  While we're young. 
[11:20:30]  While we're young.  While we're young.  It's late at night.  And I have nowhere to go.  My money's gone and off for all my friends.  And the cop says to me.  Hey, you smell bad.  Get out of here.  And he says.  And you don't have an angel.  And he said, that angel. 
[11:21:00]  Shelter me from the falling rain.  This is my life.  This is my life. 
[11:21:30]  I'm living with so much pain.  And just a little peace.  Danny, one of our favorite characters from the show is Steve from Yellowstone.  I don't know.  I kind of like Danny from W-Town myself.  Yeah, he's pretty good.  But sometimes when we have a particularly bad guest, Steve from Yellowstone will call in and give that guest the what for.  I believe this time around it was a guy who did a one-man Star Wars show. 
[11:22:00]  And Steve from Yellowstone just needed to voice his opinion.  Here it is.  Thank you.  There's no better person to be introing this bit than C-3PO himself.  O.P. and Anthony's best bits.  Best Steve from Yellowstone call in.  Ramon!  We're falling down Gary to his laptop!  Let's say hi to Charles Ross. 
[11:22:30]  One-man Star Wars show.  How's it going?  One-man show.  Yeah, based on Star Wars.  Based on Star Wars.  It is Star Wars, essentially.  It's Star Wars.  The definitive Star Wars.  I wouldn't say definitive.  I would say sort of the bastardization of it.  Bastardization.  Where do you do this?  Well, here I'm doing it in New York at the Lamb's Theater, which is 130 West 44th.  It's kind of weird, man.  Like, this is a comedy sketch that went really, really wrong.  Isn't it like Broadway over there?  Yeah, it is.  Well, it's considered off-Broadway.  Off-Broadway. 
[11:23:00]  And I'm definitely the most off thing on Broadway.  There's no...  So you're playing...  This is an off-Broadway show you're doing?  Yeah.  Well, I mean, I got my licensing agreements and stuff like that, so I mean, I don't feel  too bad about it.  Can you do it for us?  The whole thing?  Or just a piece of it?  The whole thing.  How long is it?  That's an hour.  Well, we got about an hour left of the show.  An hour, Sean.  Can you cut the 54?  I could do it, but I'd sweat all over the place and be positively disgusted.  What exactly is the theme of the show?  Well, okay, imagine you just take Star Wars and take all the tech out of it, so it's  just me doing all the voices, all the music and stuff. 
[11:23:30]  It's kind of a dumb idea, and it kind of is dumb for the first five minutes, but I think  people kind of dig it because people know Star Wars pretty well.  Do you get a lot of geeks in there?  Oh, man.  Yeah.  For sure there's a high geek sort of concentration.  Do you use props?  No.  No.  It's just you and your voice.  Yeah.  It's a really stupid idea, but I mean, I thought it was a dumb idea.  I will not argue with you.  Way to get people to buy tickets.  Do you have music that plays?  No.  It's just you.  Do you use a microphone or do you yell? 
[11:24:00]  Yeah, I do use a microphone.  I mean, you and a mic.  Yeah, well, I've played it for like...  What do you wear?  3,500 people.  Just a...  Underneath.  Underneath, I wear a kilt.  Yeah.  You wear just regular clothes, or is it...  No, no.  No, it's like a person that would work on an airplane, like a flight suit type thing.  Oh.  Just something really boring, but it's black.  It's supposed to be really neutral, and yeah, once again, I never thought this idea would  work, but that was about three years ago, and I've been doing it ever since.  And who came up to you and said, this can be off-Broadway? 
[11:24:30]  Nobody.  Nobody.  It was actually...  I met this guy when I was touring it on this thing, the Fringe Tour, which, I mean, there's  American cities that do the Fringe, and there's Canadian cities.  I'm from Canada, and...  And now it makes perfect sense.  Now it makes perfect sense.  Now I was thinking, like, wait, wait, this is a little odd.  Canadian.  There was something in the water.  Right.  So do you feel like you've seen the new ones, right?  Yeah.  I mean, I've seen some of the old ones.  My friend watched the new ones, and he thinks that a lot of the technology and stuff  has kind of surpassed a lot of what Lucas originally kind of intended to be, you know, like, his 
[11:25:00]  whole thing.  Like that space sort of cowboy western thing?  Well, um...  Well, I don't know, man.  I think the new things are made for new kids.  Like, you know, they're just made to...  I mean, they sell toys.  They get the kids to come out.  You know, they're sort of the helium-infused weird little character.  I don't know.  They're not up my alley, but when I was a kid and watched the old Star Wars films...  So you were a big fan. 
[11:25:30]  Oh, when you were a kid.  Yeah, absolutely.  What was your favorite part of the original?  The original?  Yeah.  Oh, man.  There was too many parts.  Actually, I really liked the evil guy, the emperor.  I mean, I thought he was sort of like...  Oh, really?  Well, he's like the perfect...  Not many people pick that.  Really?  That guy.  I thought he was just like the perfect sarcastic bastard, and he was perfect.  Usually Vader or, you know...  Yeah.  I don't know.  He was cool, but, you know, it's kind of hard to believe that, you know, a guy with a voice  that cool could have given, or been sort of the seed of Luke, you know, the little whiny...  Yeah, and he's whined through the entire movie. 
[11:26:00]  But if you watch the old films, or the new films now, you can see how much the Canadian  guy who plays Anakin Skywalker...  Yeah, he's a whiny bastard, too.  Now, obviously you were a big fan because you must have done the impressions.  Yeah.  Do you do the good impressions of this?  I wouldn't say there are good impressions, but some of them are good impressions.  Some of them are good.  Some of them aren't so good, like Yoda sucks, but whereas Admiral Ackbar, do you know who  I'm talking about?  Yeah, the fish eye.  Yeah, that's him, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, I mean, I do a pretty good version of that, which is kind of cool, because today  I got an audition for a Star Wars video game. 
[11:26:30]  Oh, wow.  Look at that.  Only through being in New York could you possibly get an audition to do, like, a Star Wars video  game.  Where they actually need an Admiral Ackbar.  And what about some of the sound effects?  Obviously, the lightsaber would be a big one.  I mean, it sounds really dumb.  Absolutely.  No, it sounds kind of cool.  But the point is that you get into the context of the show, right?  And, like, how is it going to work?  Is it going to work or not going to work?  Yeah.  And, um, I mean, I can give you guys, like, a two-minute bit from the show, if you want.  Absolutely.  I'd love to hear it.  Okay, this here is the trash compactor scene from the first film. 
[11:27:00]  And just bear with me.  Should I watch or kind of shut my eyes and imagine?  Oh, let's all imagine.  You want us all imagine?  Okay, audience, even if you're driving, shut your eyes.  No.  Well, let's here.  I'll stand up.  Can I move the microphone?  Yeah, you should stand up.  Oh, yeah.  And, of course, we want the listeners to comment, serious comments about...  Serious.  Yes.  We got a lot of clowns that want to call in, but we want serious comments only.  Well, Charles Ross, the one-man Star Wars show.  Here's the scene.  Get behind me.  Get behind me.  This is some rescue.  You got in here.  Didn't you have a plan for getting out?  Well, he's the brain, sweetheart. 
[11:27:30]  What the hell are you doing?  Some necessary bus kids.  In the garbage chute, fly boy.  Get in there, big wooly elf.  I don't care what you smell.  Get in there.  Get in there.  Wonderful girl.  I'm going to kill her and begin to like her.  Get in there.  Ah, the garbage chute.  What a wonderful idea.  What an incredible smell you discovered.  Well, it could be worse. 
[11:28:00]  It's worse.  There's something alive in here.  Something just swam past my leg.  Look, did you see that?  Kid, Luke.  Kid, Luke.  Blasted will you hand my gun stamped.  Where?  Anywhere.  Kid, Luke.  Kid, Luke. 
[11:28:30]  Grab him.  What happened?  I don't know.  Just let go of me and disappeared.  The walls are closing in.  Don't you stand there.  Try to brace him in something.  Wait a minute.  3PO?  Come here, 3PO.  3PO.  3PO.  Oh, where could he be?  3PO.  3PO.  Are you there, sir?  3PO.  Oh, we've had some problems. 
[11:29:00]  Will you shut up, listen to me.  Shut down all the garbage smashes on the attention level.  Do you copy?  Shut down all the garbage smashes on the attention level.  No, shut them all down.  Hurry.  Hey, you did it, 3PO.  Oh, look.  Listen to them, R2.  They're dying.  Oh, curse my little body.  I wasn't fast enough.  It's all my fault.  My fault.  We're all right.  You did great.  Ha, ha.  Where are we?  3, 2, 6, 3, 8, 2, 7.  And that's how it goes.  Wow.  But for an hour. 
[11:29:30]  Wow.  Why did you chuck all the chips across the table?  The poker chips.  That's the blessing of the poker chips.  The blessing.  The blessing of the poker chips.  The only thing I see is I did not hear Chewbacca.  Oh, well, he'd be like, mm.  I heard that.  Oh, I didn't catch it.  Okay.  All right.  Now, you do that for an hour straight.  Yeah.  Yeah.  At that speed.  Faster.  There's no...  No break.  No pauses like they would normally pause between these lines.  You just rattle it out.  Well, I mean, there's a little bit of break. 
[11:30:00]  Yeah.  I don't know.  How much of the...  You do the entire movie?  Well, I mean, it's like the Reader's Digest version.  It's, like, been really super condensed now.  Yeah.  And I do Lord of the Rings as well, which is just dumb.  But anyway, it works.  Wow.  Okay, but there's this big, big, giant dork convention, a Star Wars convention called  Celebration 3, which happened in Indianapolis.  And, I mean, you get 3,500 people watching this show at a time, which is really, really  strange. 
[11:30:30]  I don't know, man.  I don't doubt it.  Wow.  Yeah.  I mean, like, movie screens on the other side of the audience or on the other side of  the stage and then out over the audience.  And you'd never think that there could be that many people that know Star Wars that well.  And what's the reaction as you're doing it?  Are they laughing?  Oh, yeah, yeah, for sure, for sure.  And they're watching.  Well, for some people, it's just like watching a kid in the basement or something like that.  For other people, it's about being able to sort of celebrate their own personal infatuation  with Star Wars, you know?  Yeah.  So, you either find people that really are laughing at it and other people that are laughing 
[11:31:00]  sort of with you.  Yeah.  So, it's really strange to have.  Wow.  Well, you've taken something and ran with it.  Yeah.  Congratulations.  Cheers.  Thank you.  And best of luck to you.  Well, we got...  With your one-man show.  We got some phone calls coming in.  We have Jimmy Robinson on the phone.  Jimmy!  Hey, this is Jimmy from New Jersey.  Hey, Jimmy.  What's up, man?  Hey, do you do this scene?  I like this scene in Star Wars when he had the fight and then there's just the empty robe 
[11:31:30]  with no one in it.  Yeah.  Do you do that one?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Do you do the Robert Reed version?  The Robert Reed version.  Are you going to even die?  Yeah, yeah.  You stink.  Hey, serious calls only, you asshole.  You stink.  This is what happens now.  We get a guest on the show.  This is textbook.  Oh, wow.  Get a guest on the show and people call up and no matter how much we tell them we just  want serious calls, the assholes get through.  You stink.  Do you get a lot of criticism? 
[11:32:00]  You're at stinks.  Do you get a lot of criticism?  There's a lot of criticism and that's really highbrow criticism, man.  Yeah.  That's amazing.  Yeah.  I mean, I'm crushed.  The thing is, I think based upon that kind of a phone call, I'm pretty much resolved  not to do the show anymore.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, I'm sure that guy was...  That was the last time, guys, you're ever going to hear it.  Loser sitting in his apartment, probably getting prostitutes at night to piss on him.  Let's say hi to Dr. Frank Davis.  Dr. Frank Davis.  Hey, how you doing, guys?  I'm a doctor at Bellevue, a psychiatrist. 
[11:32:30]  Listen, just keep him distracted.  We're sending a few guys down to get him.  You stink, you nut job.  Thank you.  Let's say hi to...  Let's say hi to...  Let's go to Ben in Boston.  Ben?  You like that, huh, Ben?  Ben?  Yeah.  Can you even see where the Falcon goes and pick up Tom Brady?  We all do...  Seems to be doing his own one-man show all day long.  I think this guy enjoyed it.  Ben from Boston. 
[11:33:00]  Holy man, I've got to get there to Boston.  Yeah.  Any ideas of maybe taking it on the road?  It's been on the road for the last three years, man.  Really?  So you're not just here in New York, you'll be going other places?  No, there's this thing called Clear Channel, which I'm sure we're all aware of.  Yes, everybody is there.  I'm going to...  At least with the Lord of the Rings show, I'm going to be going to South Africa and Singapore  and...  You're shitting me.  Man, I really...  Is there good money in this?  I haven't had another job for the last four years, man. 
[11:33:30]  Have you had to pay Lucas anything?  Oh, yeah.  I mean, you get a proper licensing agreement.  Yeah.  If you don't do that, you can, you know...  Yeah, that'll cost you.  So, I mean, it's weird.  I really never intended for this show to go as it has, and I'm really glad that it has.  What, was it just kind of a hobby?  No, it was a...  I mean, I was working as an actor, and one day, like, literally, I wrote this comedy sketch,  and when I say it went really wrong, it went really, really right or really, really wrong,  because I didn't think people would be able to sort of keep up with it, and people have 
[11:34:00]  been able to keep up with it, so this has kind of almost left my own hands.  I find myself here, not intending to come here to New York to bring this here, but, you  know, it's kind of go bigger or go back home, and, I mean, I don't have a  problem doing it, and...  You're going to franchise it out?  No, I don't think so.  Get some other actors to do it, and you just sit home and pocket some cash?  That would be nice, but turn into Jabba the Hutt and lose my leg.  That's it.  Why don't we go to Steve in Yellowstone? 
[11:34:30]  Steve in Yellowstone.  Steve?  Hi, I just wanted to know if you had any type of a copyright problem when you were dealing  with George Lucas, like I've had sometimes on my website.  Yeah, I mean, it is a copyright problem, because it is, you know, a matter of...  Ramon!  Ramon!  Bring me someone with talent.  What the fuck are you talking about, you fucking retard?  Yeah!  Yeah!  Have fun in Yellowstone, buddy.  Maybe you can sit on, like, you know, the Old Faithful and have it go up your ass, you 
[11:35:00]  stupid piece of shit.  Ramon!  Wow.  Wow, man.  I'm absolutely, you know, crushed down to my very foundations, man.  I just don't...  This is amazing.  All right, thank you, Steve in Yellowstone.  Ramon!  A guy is successful taking something and using his talent to get out on stage and actually  do...  Yeah, and did you, uh, uh, you've been an actor, you said, uh...  Yeah, yeah, I mean, uh...  So now you're finally doing...  ...that are calling in here. 
[11:35:30]  God, man.  Yeah, I think it's pretty impressive.  Steve...  Something.  You want to do another scene, or...?  Ah, no, no.  That's fine, actually.  I mean, not many of the scenes from the show really work purely on radio, like, because a  lot of it doesn't really all stick together.  But, I mean, like, you get something like, you know, ho, ho, ho, ho, she became a garbawarpa  kawawuki, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, which is obviously, you know...  Jabba.  No, it's Princess Leia.  But, uh, you know...  Of course.  Yeah.  I mean, there's scenes that people definitely recognize, and there's characters, like, 
[11:36:00]  you know, people recognize, right?  Yes.  And I'm like, hmm...  Of course.  Yeah.  But, um...  Yeah.  It's weird, man.  Like, you kind of have to see it on stage in order to really get the full idea of it.  Well, that's why it's a stage show, and you don't have a CD out.  Do you have a CD out?  No.  It's not a CD or a DVD.  And that's the other thing, man.  Like, if, uh...  It's a weird thing with, you know, copyright material, you know...  You can only do this in one medium, live, like that.  If you wanted to put a CD out, you'd have to pay Lucas more money. 
[11:36:30]  Ah, yeah.  I don't think I could ever get the rights to do it.  No?  No, not really.  And that's okay.  I mean, it's something I wouldn't want to franchise out, because as long as I can do it, I'll continue  doing it.  Right.  And hopefully we'll not be a 65-year-old man, you know, like, the one-man Star Wars trilogy,  you know, like, nattering out on stage.  That'd be a little rough.  Listen to the screams of a person in Yellowstone National Park.  Sounds like you need some...  Ah, that guy with the lungs.  That guy was just an ass.  Oh, well.  So what are the details?  The show's here in New York, right?  It is indeed, yeah.  It plays every night at 8 o'clock, except for Wednesdays. 
[11:37:00]  Right now we have matinees at 3 o'clock.  And it's going to be changing the schedule up a bit.  We'll still have the shows at 8 o'clock every night, but we'll have a 3 o'clock.  Matinee on Saturday and Sunday.  Mm-hmm.  And you can get tickets by calling telecharge.  Jimmy, you missed it.  Wow.  You all right?  Yes.  I was trying to get some production stuff, because they're...  Oh.  Yeah.  It's always the way.  Yes.  Well, Charles, thank you very much.  Oh, thanks for having me, guys.  We're coming in.  Sorry about the goddamn phone calls. 
[11:37:30]  You were in 15 minutes, why are you?  Jackasses.  That's all right.  Yeah, it's just production stuff that Ben was supposed to do and did not do.  Oh.  Can you do...  Thank you very much.  Can you do C-3PO?  C-3PO.  R2-D2, where are you?  Yeah.  Can you do...  I pardon you.  Jesus.  I pardon you.  They could just go on and on.  How about...  I don't know all the characters.  I was at the yesterday.  It was like a...  R2?  No, no.  Yeah, R2. 
[11:38:00]  Well, if you don't know the show, I mean, if you don't know the movies, it's obviously  not going to be something.  No, I saw the first one, but I don't know any of the new guys.  I do know R2 with my slide whistle.  Yeah, see?  You need a prop.  I feel like a prop sometimes.  Oh, don't you sweat it.  I won't.  I like seeing a successful guy.  Of course.  Cheers, guys.  Thanks a lot.  All right.  Thank you.  Charles Ross, one-man Star Wars show.  And there he goes.  We should take a break, I think, huh?  Charles?  Uh, we're going to take a break. 
[11:38:30]  We're going to regroup, and we'll continue with the Opie and Anthony show in a few moments.  Uh, yeah?  Yeah?  We're going to continue in a couple of moments.  What happened?  Holy shit.  What happened?  Oh, was he fucking pissed.  Why?  Livid.  He just walked out, by the way.  That wasn't a take it easy.  He immediately left.  And he, yeah, just...  Did he cut some liners?  No.  He took off before his crew here even knew that he was gone. 
[11:39:00]  He was already out the door.  And they were like, oh, he left already.  And they took off after him.  Someone follow him with the cell phone.  Wow.  As he pissed off.  See, what's wrong?  Yeah.  Someone who has balls?  See, what's...  Yeah.  Hurry up, Hawkins.  See, what's wrong?  Ask him, you know, if everything went okay.  Well, that stupid caller from Yellowstone pissed him off.  Steve from Yellowstone.  Well, that's Derek.  Creative little boy.  Steve from Yellowstone.  I sometimes have problems.  Hello?  No?  I thought we had somebody. 
[11:39:30]  What's the problem?  I'll wait.  Here we go.  Eric.  Yeah.  What's up?  Hey.  Hang on one second.  Hey, before you guys go, can they talk to you one more time?  It was about the Lamb Theater and everything like that for his plug, because he didn't  say anything about the theater and all that.  He did.  The Lamb Theater?  Can they talk to you one more time?  Just...  We don't think it went well.  We want to ask him why he left angry.  Okay.  Hold on.  Hey.  Charles, you're not mad, are you?  No, it's just... 
[11:40:00]  What happened?  It's all right, man.  No, what happened?  The theater is 130 West 44.  No, but the thing was, you seemed like you left when you were mad.  Yeah, I know.  I just had...  You know, it's just kind of shitty, the phone calls coming in, and I don't know.  I kind of feel like it's an uphill battle, man.  I was puking all yesterday, and I've been puking this morning.  I'm really kind of sick, so it's not your fault.  It's me.  Charles.  The audience, too.  Charles, there's only three phone calls.  I know.  I know, man.  Out of the three we talked. 
[11:40:30]  That's not that bad.  It's not your guys' fault, man.  I'm just being a big baby, so...  Yeah.  Sorry.  Yeah, but why are you being a baby?  All right.  You're very talented, obviously, and the show's doing very well.  No, it's going well, man.  Are you not sick like a flu or something, are you?  Yeah, I've had the flu for like the last couple of days.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  Hope you didn't bring it in here.  I hope I did.  Why?  Where's the...  Charles, are you mad at us, though?  No.  No.  God, no, man.  Not at all.  Who are you mad at? 
[11:41:00]  Just the whole guys calling in and stuff like that.  Yeah, we get that, though, every day.  We get people to call up and bash that, too.  You know, you do put yourself out there, and it's like, I'm pretty easy to kick in the  balls, and I try to always kibosh the people trying to kick me in the balls beforehand.  Yeah.  You know, and it's like...  That Steve guy calls every day, though.  Yeah, Steve calls us and bashes us every day.  You should hear what he says about us every day.  Steve in Yellowstone stinks, and that guy, Ben in Boston, is awful, if you understand what 
[11:41:30]  he's saying.  They're like regular callers that we can't screen out that just call up and bash us and  our guests all the time.  Yeah.  That guy drives a hybrid car, for God's sake.  Enough said.  Yeah.  I just, you know, when you feel sick, and, you know, you try to put it out there, it  just, I don't know, and I feel like an uphill battle.  Oh, no. 
[11:42:00]  No, you did not.  Oh, you scumbag.  Holy shit.  He's talking about the uphill battle.  Oh, you didn't.  Gotta give the guy credit, though.  I threw that entire poker chip thing at him, and he didn't even flinch.  He didn't even miss a...  He didn't even stop. 
[11:42:30]  You can act like a man.  What's the matter with you?  Why is it already calling back?  Hopefully he's got a fist in his gum line.  Dude, I just...  Frunk.  She had fucking mayonnaise leaking out of his teeth.  Been shot to the mouth.  Oh.  Right now that dummy is trying to explain why, like, the phone hung up, and it's still showing  the minutes they're taking.  Like, no, I...  Dude. 
[11:43:00]  Yeah, let's get him back on the phone.  What happened?  Are you kidding?  Why'd he hang up on us?  Okay.  Eric, why did you...  Yeah, the phone must have cut out or something.  Ah, damn it.  All right.  Hold on.  That wasn't me hanging up.  No?  All right.  We thought, because right when that happened, we were like, uh-oh, he's pissed.  Yeah, we don't want...  No, we don't want you going away mad, and we want to give you the final word here.  So, uh, Charles.  Yeah, yeah, I know.  So what were you saying?  Um, I don't know what I was... 
[11:43:30]  I guess it's just, you know...  You're saying you were feeling sick or something like that?  It's just about...  No, no, I didn't.  Okay, I had to do, like, two shows yesterday, and it was, like, wolfing between the shows.  I don't know.  Everybody's got some kind of cold looks, I'm sorry.  No, it was something about an uphill battle, and...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And you're easy to get to, and you're working on that or something like that?  What's that?  You said something about, and it was a thought that kind of got cut off, that you're easy  to kick in the balls or get to, and you feel like...  Oh, yeah, I mean, like, try doing this at the show here, right?  And, like, you know, sometimes trying to maintain a sense of, like, feeling good about yourself. 
[11:44:00]  You know, it's such a strange thing to be doing, because, like...  I can't be part of this.  This show stinks.  You feel good about yourself.  Ka-chink.  You know.  Right now...  That's hard sometimes. 
[11:44:30]  Click.  And right now, Eric is trying to explain why it once again cut off, and why the mouthpiece  smells like the inside of a baby coffin.  I can't...  Breathe.  Nope.  All right.  Oh!  Oh, my God.  Eric, what happened?  He came back in. 
[11:45:00]  He followed me, and he wants to come back in.  Oh.  And we've moved.  All right.  No, no, no, let me get out of the studio first, because I've got to call him again.  Yeah.  You can come on.  No, keep his hammer away from that window.  I know.  Where's Ben?  Ben's in the back office.  Dude.  What the hell is going on?  Oh, Jesus.  That's too funny.  There he is.  I don't know what's going on with the phone.  Were you in the elevator area? 
[11:45:30]  No, I was going to the bathroom.  Oh, no.  No.  Why?  It's not you guys at all, man.  Yeah.  On my days off, I got to look after my girlfriend and our two friends that came from Victoria  to visit us, and they were puking, lying down on the couch and on the bed, just barfing  in bags and stuff.  What's Victoria?  Canada?  Yeah, British Columbia.  Oh, okay.  Where are you from up there?  Victoria.  Victoria?  I live in Victoria, but I was born in this place called Prince George, BC. 
[11:46:00]  Did you ever see the movie Strange Brew?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, with Rick Moran.  That's all we know of Canada is through Strange Brew.  Strange Brew.  Well, it was filmed in Prince George, BC.  That's where I was born and where I kind of grew up until I was like 11 years old or  something.  And I watched...  Oh, thank you.  I never told you, but I'd watched the Star Wars trilogy like over 400 times before I  was 11 years old.  Oh, you did?  Mm-hmm.  Why?  It was just your thing?  We didn't have television.  We had a television.  We had a VCR.  But we didn't have cable. 
[11:46:30]  It was very cool when you were a kid.  I mean, I watched that movie, I can't even tell you how many times, too.  Oh.  You were a kid?  I mean, sitting there, opening scene, first time you ever saw it?  Yeah.  It was the best thing ever.  Of course.  But, I mean, I put it on like sort of as background noise.  Do you know what I mean?  Really?  In the morning.  Just...  Wait, you just had no TV?  Did you get the whole movie memorized?  Uh, no.  Word for word?  No?  I doubt it.  I doubt it.  I mean, when I wrote this, though, it was going from memory rather than going back and  watching the films and trying to dress it up.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  So there could be some inaccuracies.  Oh, huge inaccuracies. 
[11:47:00]  And you get people telling me that I've got this wrong or that wording wrong or something  wrong and it's like, well, who cares?  They're probably dressed like Jedi with lightsabers in their hands when they tell  you this.  I've met a lot of those people.  You've been to the conventions?  Uh, well, just to perform, I've never actually been to a convention.  Yeah.  Outside of a...  Scary people.  Well, some, but a lot of these people have really normal jobs and normal lives too,  right?  Yeah.  Like, they just, they do normal things except that this is their hobby.  True.  Well, you've got a lot of action on the phones.  I mean, they're just going crazy.  Oh, great.  We've got a call coming in from Riskless, Montana. 
[11:47:30]  Well, let's do it.  This is Travis.  Travis!  Hey, dude, why are they giving you such a hard time?  I thought it was pretty good when you did.  All right.  Good.  There you go.  I told you.  I'm a fan of the movie.  I mean, it's hard to find somebody that kind of knows everything about the movie.  And everybody thinks I'm a geek, but I like the movie.  Well, there's nothing wrong with that.  People think I'm a geek too.  There you go.  I told you when you started watching the movies and stuff.  How old was I?  He said he saw the movie 400 times before he was 11, I think.  Before he was 11.  I thought it was in Waikiki.  We used to live between Waikiki and Prince George. 
[11:48:00]  So the first time I saw it was near the Waikiki Banyan, if you've ever been to Waikiki.  Ramon!  Ramon!  What?  What?  Did you just...  Ramon!  Oh, it's this guy again.  Did you just squeal off the road again, buddy?  Ramon!  Is this Steve?  Tell this guy to talk.  Ramon!  This guy's a black dick.  Why do the screeners...  No, this guy tricked us.  I suck dick.  The screeners can't find out that that's not Travis? 
[11:48:30]  Ramon!  Star Wars is a faggot.  Alright, we get it.  Ramon!  Tell this guy to talk.  Steve, please lose the phone number.  Where do you live, man?  Ramon!  Tell this guy to talk.  I'm hungry.  Holy shit, dude.  The guy's cracking himself up.  This is awesome.  Alright, Steve.  Do you want my home number, fuckhead? 
[11:49:00]  Really?  What?  You know, they're faceless people.  I love it.  Like message board people.  Ramon!  They love joking and bashing.  But they never want to confront anybody.  Come down to the studio.  We'll kick your ass.  Why don't you come in the studio, buddy?  Steve.  Enough.  Go find your boyfriend, Ramon, or whatever the hell.  Why don't you come in the studio?  If you had balls.  Alright, there he goes.  Jesus. 
[11:49:30]  Sorry about that, buddy.  It's a daily battle on this show to deal with these assholes.  Brian Clifton.  What's up?  Hey, this is Brian from Clifton Park.  Hey, Brian.  I saw them at Celebration 3.  I loved them.  I really did.  Oh, okay.  All this crap they're giving you is a bunch of bullshit.  Saw the show?  Very talented.  I love the films.  You know, what people do, and it's a great film, and I can't believe that people are dissing  them like this.  It's a bunch of jack-offs.  You're always going to get it.  Keep doing what you're doing.  I saw it at Celebration 3. 
[11:50:00]  Keep it up.  I'm punching out.  Thank you.  One or two.  What they call the Bad Apples.  So what is with Ramone?  I don't get it.  I don't know.  Every time this Steve guy calls, it's always about Ramone.  We still don't know what it means.  But he actually listens to the radio, and then bothers to call in.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's what he does.  Wow.  He actually listens, and then calls in to Bash.  Is he like your sort of village idiot?  Yeah, every day. 
[11:50:30]  Every day.  Every day.  Every day we've got to deal with this shit.  Ramone.  Ramone.  Who cares, Ramone?  Uh, Dan in New Hampshire checking in.  Let's say hi to Liddy.  Liddy!  Hey, how you doing?  Hello?  Liddy.  What's up, Liddy?  Why is everybody giving this guy a hard...  Liddy, you stink.  Look.  Ramone.  Ramone.  All right.  We can't do it again.  Ramone.  Darth Vader has AIDS. 
[11:51:00]  Holy shit, dude.  Would you...  Why do you call?  Ramone.  T-3PO should be molested.  Man.  Wash my balls.  He's got an...  He's Liddy.  He's Liddy.  Ramone.  Liddy and Ramone.  Like, what the hell?  What?  Liddy.  This is Liddy.  Ramone.  Ramone is going to be an awful producer.  He needs a writer, obviously.  You got no material, dude. 
[11:51:30]  Ramone.  Why a writer says hiring that lazy bag of shit?  I don't even know what he's talking about.  All right.  Wow.  Thank you, Liddy.  Goddamn.  So, he's like an honorary DJ or like on the...  Honorary?  The Eye in the Sky or something like that?  Yeah.  For some reason, he's very good at getting past the screeners.  Let's go to the Ramone part.  Guys, any more Steve from Yellowstone calls and you guys are done. 
[11:52:00]  I mean, Jesus.  Check the caller ID.  Yeah.  Don't we have caller ID?  Ben, what's up?  Yeah, what's up?  Yo, what's up?  I want him to do Yoda eating Princess Leia's ass.  Ramone.  No, this is not Ramone.  Was that him?  This is somebody totally new.  Yeah, do you do that though?  Oh.  Seriously, if you do all the voices, do you mess around with the voices a little bit?  No, not really.  Do an alternate scene?  Well, no eating of Leia's ass.  No.  But that would be great.  Any other movies that you have in mind to take into this? 
[11:52:30]  I was thinking of Terms of Endearment, maybe.  Terms of Endearment.  That would be great.  How about blowing Chewbacca?  Blowing Chewbacca.  Blowing Chewbacca.  All right.  Look at the size of that thing.  I think Star Wars The Wrath of Khan.  Star Trek The Wrath of Khan would probably be a good one.  Good choice.  Sonny Ferrelli, what's up?  Hey, this guy's really good, man.  Oh.  Ramone.  All right.  Hey, you know something?  Your book is doing an excellent job.  What's his name, Ramone?  Punching out.  That's not even Steve.  What?  I don't even get that one. 
[11:53:00]  All right.  Frenchy.  Hey.  This guy is very good.  Why is everybody giving him shit?  Ramone.  Hey.  Is that the real Frenchy?  Yes.  It's muck.  You like it?  It's muck.  Yes, I like him.  It's good.  Oh, okay.  He does a good job.  Come to my restaurant.  Oh, plug your restaurant.  Ramone, this guy sucks.  Ramone.  Ramone.  Ramone.  Bring this guy.  A self-inflicted gunshot wound. 
[11:53:30]  All right, plug.  Hi, Ramone.  I've had it.  I have had it.  Bring me a hybrid vehicle.  Ramone.  You really gotta bring this guy on, man.  Bring me a belly the size of a change purse.  Ramone.  Jesus, guys.  Ramone.  Shave my arms.  All right.  Thank you, Frenchy. 
[11:54:00]  Thank you.  All right.  Thanks.  Jesus.  All right.  Well, Charles.  Charles, again.  The Star Wars show.  Again, thank you very much.  Also, I believe in the new year we're going to be opening up the One Man Lord of the Rings  probably in the same space as well.  Right here in New York.  Yeah.  Very cool.  Can you give us a little taste of that?  Sure.  We wants it.  We needs it.  Must have the precious.  Master is our friend.  You don't have any friends.  Nobody likes you. 
[11:54:30]  I'm not listening.  You're a liar and a thief.  Nope.  Murderer.  I hate you.  But it was with me.  Him.  Him.  It was me.  We survived because of me.  Not anymore.  What?  We don't need you.  Leave now and never come back.  Leave now and never come back.  Anyway.  Yeah. 
[11:55:00]  Wow.  Yeah.  That's pretty damn good.  No more chips done at me though.  This is good.  That's...  Well...  What's up Jimmy?  Did he get the...  Yeah, he's getting the auction stuff all together.  Okay.  Cool.  Very good.  All right.  Charles did a great job for us today.  Thanks so much.  Feel better.  All right.  I hope so.  Cheers.  That was sent in by a listener.  Are you kidding me?  Ha ha.  They all suck.  All right.  Manhattan.  Mimosa.  Is this thing on?
