<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often transitioning abruptly between them.  The show opened with discussions about Roger Clemens' perjury trial and Antonio Cromartie's numerous children with multiple women.  The Clemens discussion started lightheartedly but quickly turned to cynical commentary on sports news coverage and devolved into vulgar jokes about New Jersey.  The Cromartie discussion dominated a significant portion, marked by highly offensive and sexually explicit language, racial slurs, and heated debates about the situation's comedic or serious nature, and the lack of public criticism. Callers contributed to the inflammatory exchange, further fueling the discussion of race and socioeconomic disparities.

The show then shifted to a discussion on the limitations of discussing race professionally, contrasting it with the show's freedom of speech. This led to a bizarre conversation about sex, followed by reflections on societal decline, offensive language, and the controversy surrounding the planned mosque near Ground Zero.  A significant portion focused on a website listing athletes with numerous illegitimate children, sparking further debate about race and societal factors, with a caller referencing the book *Black Rednecks and White Liberals*.  The hosts also discussed Jennifer Aniston's use of the "R-word," the media's hypocrisy, and the power of offensive words.  Upcoming guests Paul Mooney and TJ Miller were mentioned, and a segment featured Jim Norton's early, offensive stand-up routine.

A caller's mention of Jennifer Aniston again brought the discussion back to the "R-word," leading to a debate about its offensiveness and its impact on individuals with intellectual disabilities.  The conversation expanded to encompass other offensive terms, including racial slurs, referencing Michael Richards' racial rant and Obama's bowling comments.  A caller shared a personal anecdote about his autistic daughter.  This section also included unrelated caller anecdotes, jokes (including a racially charged one), a discussion of Larry King,  the hosts' personal digressions (ranging from Pearl Jam to Snooki's physique and Zsa Zsa Gabor), and a running gag.  The BP oil spill and a Jewish serial killer were also mentioned.  Paul Mooney joined the studio.

With Paul Mooney as a guest, the show discussed Hollywood casting choices, specifically criticizing the casting of white actresses as Cleopatra and Harriet Tubman, using racially charged humor.  The conversation transitioned to Roger Clemens' trial, cheating in sports, and offensive racial stereotypes.  Mooney shared anecdotes about Richard Pryor, incorporating racist and sexually explicit language.  He also discussed his own experiences with racism in Hollywood.  The segment also covered Chelsea Clinton's wedding, the mosque near Ground Zero, and Mount Rushmore.

A subsequent segment featured a discussion about New Zealand, the Maori people, and offensive jokes about anthrax blankets. This transitioned to the Crazy Horse monument and crude jokes. A caller, Ira, joined with a woman and her daughter, leading to an extremely vulgar and sexually explicit conversation about the woman's book on fellatio, and detailed discussions of sexual techniques.  E-Rock participated in the mocking of Ira's hygiene and an attempt to have the woman and daughter demonstrate fellatio on a dildo obtained from off-air staff.   Racial slurs and numerous crude jokes were used throughout.

Finally, a segment focused on Paul Mooney's book, including a humorous negative endorsement from Mooney himself.  The show concluded with numerous goodbyes and wishes for a good weekend, with TJ mentioned as present.  Throughout the entire broadcast, the show featured numerous listener calls, many containing explicit and offensive content.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  We'll be right back. 
[00:00:30]  It's that Forrest's mother was talking about.  You're a no good son of a bitch.  Bob, you mother fucker.  We're so much fucking better than you.  Absolute lunacy.  If you're giving me the hook, fine, whatever.  I do what I'm told.  I'm completely out of control.  It doesn't get better than this.  Come on.  It's shocking.  Put enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Goodness gracious.  Goodness gracious.  Goodness gracious.  Goodness gracious.  Of all the dramatic things I've ever seen, the prosecutor's smiling. 
[00:01:00]  And the jury, they know.  Goodness gracious.  I guess there's no mistake who's going to be in that jail cell.  Of all the dramatic things I've ever seen, at least now there's no mystery as to who's  going to be getting fucked in the ass with soap on the floor.  Goodness gracious.  Oh, boy, Roger.  Roger Clemens.  And I guess I'll be seeing you all in the weight room. 
[00:01:30]  Of all the dramatic things I've ever seen, I'm going to rub my tits on a glass so we can  jerk off.  Goodness gracious.  Oh, Roger.  Oh, boy.  Oh, is he in touch?  I wonder if the prosecution wants to know if Andy Pettit knew.  You should see what's going on in the Yankee dugout.  Should we?  Gina's crying.  Gina's testifying. 
[00:02:00]  Pettit's making grilled cheese with an iron.  Goodness gracious.  A-Rod has a pocket pussy.  Oh, yeah.  Big story.  Roger Clemens might be going to jail for lying.  Yeah.  You lie, Pee-wee.  And A-Rod was telling me he didn't even have to testify.  Nah, this was his own choice.  He was trying to be like a man.  Like a Texas man. 
[00:02:30]  Yeah.  What was he trying to accomplish if he didn't have to testify at all?  Yeah, to go in front of Congress.  Why would you take that chance?  Because you have to raise that right hand and, you know, give the little oath there.  Congress scares the shit out of everybody.  You can't lie to Congress.  Everybody.  They'll nail you on perjury.  Yeah.  Lying.  But he didn't even have to go there, right?  I think he volunteered to go and talk about it.  And talk about what he knows about steroids.  Yeah.  And it turns out he might be lying and maybe now going to jail. 
[00:03:00]  Yep.  I mean, it's a long road from here, but it could end with a jail sentence.  Goodness gracious.  Goodness gracious.  Yeah.  Of all the dramatic lies.  Proving that the fans can't listen to the entire show.  The first feedback today.  Hey, guys, check out the video in Spain where the bull leaped into the stands in a bullfight and injured 40 people.  What day is it?  I was telling Anthony before the show, these newspapers that we read every morning are completely useless at this point. 
[00:03:30]  I look at the paper thinking it's yesterday's news or yesterday's paper because everything we talked about yesterday, not everything, but a lot of the stuff we talked about yesterday is in the paper today because we're getting our news from the Internet.  How antiquated are newspapers?  Yeah, because they got the bull story and the big picture of the bull jumping into the stands today in the paper.  We talked about it.  We played the video yesterday.  Yeah.  That's how far behind the papers have become.  With the intranets, there's no reason to pick up a fucking newspaper. 
[00:04:00]  No.  There really isn't.  Of all the dramatic things.  That's a great story, too.  New York is a weird place.  You got the picture in front of you, Jimmy.  The Empire State Building is really pissed off.  I didn't know a building could get pissed off, but I guess you can.  Because there's a new building.  There's developers that basically want to block the view of the Empire State Building with a huge, massive new building.  From where?  I don't know.  Like block the view from Jersey or from the east side?  I think the important view, which would be what? 
[00:04:30]  Coming in from Jersey.  Maybe coming in from Jersey.  I don't think that's important.  Like coming, yeah.  I mean, that's to me is the view of the Empire State Building.  Where do you think it's from?  Is it from Brooklyn?  I don't know.  Well, when I come in from Queens, Long Island, you cross over the East River.  That is the skyline.  Like you see the skyline like you don't see it from anywhere else.  But I think the skyline picture that everyone knows of Manhattan is from Jersey.  Yeah.  That's the way everybody, like the photographers take it.  Yeah, absolutely.  Is it?  Because you got the river right there.  I think it's a good distance to take photos. 
[00:05:00]  I've discussed that many times.  But yeah, it's going to be a 667-foot...  It's just going to block.  No, 67 stories and 1,200...  It's 34 feet shorter.  Right.  So you'll see the little antenna popping out of the Empire State Building.  You'll see a little blinking red light every so often on the antenna.  Why not just make it taller?  Yeah.  That Empire State Building, do you understand, is 80 years old?  Right.  It's fucking 80!  And they cheated. 
[00:05:30]  Half the building is a dumb fucking antenna.  Yes.  It's not that tall, really.  Well, they didn't have the antenna years ago when it was first built.  I see.  The New Jersey view would be blocked.  And that is the big view.  Well, screw Jersey.  Maybe.  Who cares?  Maybe.  How would you screw Jersey?  Nice work, Lou.  Just grab...  Nice work, Roger.  How would you do it?  Grab Hoboken by the hips and just start pounding away in Newark?  Fuck Camden.  Put your dick in Camden.  It really stinks.  You're going to get a disease if you fuck Camden.  Yeah, that is the Jersey view, huh? 
[00:06:00]  Yeah, see, that's the famous fucking view that you've seen a million times.  Although the view, like you said, coming in from Long Island is pretty impressive.  The one I see every day is the most important because, you know, I see it.  Right, I know.  It's all about you.  Yeah, but you see it with a hand over one eye.  Hand over one eye.  Making sure there's only one building.  Oh, God.  So, yeah, it's fucking Clemens, man.  Goodness gracious.  Clemens, Clemens, Clemens. 
[00:06:30]  Roger Clemens is in Tyrone's cell.  Is that all we have on that, I guess?  Well, is that really?  Yeah, we're not a sports talk show.  It's brand new, you know, it's, oh, I'm sure the sports talk shows are going to be all over today.  Poor mad dog.  Roger Clemens.  Poor mad dog.  Going to be coming to jail.  Lying to Congress.  We're going to take our 100th phone call on this.  What else can you discuss about it?  That's why I can't listen to sports talk.  Yeah, it's.  Move on.  There'll be callers.  Move the fuck on. 
[00:07:00]  Bell from Queens.  Right.  What's your angle on this?  I think, you know, he shouldn't have lied.  Absolutely, he shouldn't have lied.  To Congress.  There's no more angles.  Move on.  Yeah.  Talk hockey.  Never.  Most sports talk shows don't talk hockey.  No.  You have plenty of time to talk about hockey.  That's a Canadian sport.  No one really cares about it.  No.  We're heading toward opening day, my friend.  Really?  Yeah, we are.  Opening day of what?  Everything?  Yeah.  Well, football already? 
[00:07:30]  Yeah, we'll have all the sports playing at one time.  Yeah, many crickets.  That happens when?  Somewhere in early November, maybe?  November.  Somewhere around there.  Early October.  Early October.  Early October.  Everyone's playing?  Yeah, well, football starts in September.  Right, we know that.  And...  I always forget when hockey starts.  Hockey starts in October.  Yeah, first week in October.  What about basketball?  And then basketball's a little later, I thought.  Maybe mid-October, right?  Oh.  Oh, boy.  I don't know. 
[00:08:00]  Someone call up Mad Dog and ask him.  He'll discuss that for an hour for you.  Oh, he'll tell you.  Yeah, the ins and outs.  Well, if you want to think back in the 50s, it started a lot earlier than it does now.  Right, exactly.  What else is going on?  Oh, Jeff.  You know, by the way, one thing on Morthand Clemens, he's in the middle of a lawsuit with  his old trainer.  Who he sued.  He sued his trainer.  Sue everyone.  For defamation.  Yeah.  So if he did this and knew he did it, how are you suing the guy for defamation?  Oh.  So the trainer's laughing right now.  Oh, boy.  That's good. 
[00:08:30]  Could you give me off the hook, Lou?  For old times' sake.  Will I keep him out of the hall, you think?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  How do you do that?  Hall of Fame.  Come on.  The Hall of Fame is starting to become a joke.  Yeah, dude.  Because all these players were doing their shit.  All of them, yeah.  Just put them all in.  Pete Rose.  Put them all in.  It's an imperfect...  It's like you could argue, well, DiMaggio, but they played at a time where blacks weren't  allowed.  It's like they didn't compete against the highest level of competition at all.  Right.  And if I'm paying $10 to $12 for a hot dog, really? 
[00:09:00]  Really?  Put everyone in the Hall of Fame.  Yeah.  Everyone.  They're fucking cheating us.  Yeah.  I don't know, man.  That is rough.  If Clemens doesn't make it in because of that, lying to Congress.  I think at a point, the Hall of Fame becomes, you know, kind of laughable.  It's ridiculous, then.  If these guys just, one after another, don't make it into the Hall of Fame.  Yeah.  How do you keep Roger Clemens out, really?  Was that Wyclef with a guy with a machine gun behind him? 
[00:09:30]  He's in Haiti.  He wants to be president.  Yeah.  Yeah, I know.  So, like, look at the guy with the camo and the machine gun and...  Oh, yeah, man.  What's going on?  Wasn't he in the Fugees?  What happened?  Yeah.  Like, what?  Fucking Reagan was a movie star.  So, what are you talking about?  I know.  It's just odd, like...  You go back in time and people said, well, those Reagan guys are going to be president.  They would have laughed at you.  The actor?  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  Exactly. 
[00:10:00]  I suppose next you're going to tell me, Jane Wyman is the first lady.  Yes.  And who's a better candidate than Wyclef?  Well, the thing is, Ronald Reagan was head of the Screen Actors Guild and then governor...  Yeah.  Mayor!  He was governor of California.  He worked his way up.  Yeah.  Wyclef just wants to go from fucking, you know...  Dude, if you could...  Singing to president. 
[00:10:30]  If you could be the El Presidente of Tropico...  El Presidente!  Then Wyclef could be the president of Haiti.  But I was very bad at Tropico.  So...  I would lock up dissidents and kill people.  But if he...  And I wouldn't last without a revolution for, you know, maybe an hour.  But if he's the president of Haiti, who's going to...  And it fucks up, who's going to know?  How do you...  If he's the president...  Yeah, how do you fuck up Haiti?  But how are you going to know if he's doing a good job or not?  You want to talk about being under the radar.  That's true.  No one really...  What makes a bad president in a place like that? 
[00:11:00]  Like Haiti.  Yeah, that is tough.  And you ask the Haitians.  I mean, I go on vacation a lot down at Turks and Caicos.  Yeah.  And the local news, they're always talking about Haitians coming to...  They just want out.  Yeah.  That's one of those places where they're always fleeing.  They want out.  Just get me out of here.  And every year, it ruins my vacation because there's another fucking, you know, boat or  something that has capsized off the coast of Turks and Caicos losing a bunch of Haitians 
[00:11:30]  trying to make a better life for themselves.  That's 60 people.  And when you're trying to enjoy a corona...  Yeah.  ...as the sun's going down...  It's disturbing.  ...that's in the back of your mind that a Haitian might come floating up on shore.  I don't need that kind of inconvenience during my vacations.  No.  No, of course not.  Look it up for yourself.  Haitians don't want to be in Haiti.  Google it.  Half of Turks and Caicos is...  Haitians?  Oh, yeah.  A lot of Haitians.  Wow.  A lot of Haitians, yeah. 
[00:12:00]  Wasn't like that years ago.  A lot of Haitians and a lot of wild dogs.  Really?  Lots of wild dogs.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Feral dogs?  I don't know.  I think they're like fucking wolves or something.  Ooh.  That's frightening.  Don't leave the compound.  So what were you saying?  Why Cliff with a guy with a machine gun?  Yeah, yeah.  That guy with the machine gun.  That just seems odd.  Like they wouldn't kind of hide that like Secret Service does.  Mm-hmm.  And he's just, you know, a candidate.  Is he even a candidate or is he still just talking about it? 
[00:12:30]  But he's got a guy with a machine gun.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Walking around.  I don't know.  No, he's not on the official list of approved candidates.  No.  That's what I think.  Like he talked to the president yesterday, I guess.  Talked to the Haitian president.  What's his, like, platform?  People not starving?  Yeah.  I'm going to try to feed a few people.  Yeah.  He might have a shot at it.  Who knows?  He probably will from his celebrity status.  Awful me from Whack Bag. 
[00:13:00]  You need the clip.  I heard about this.  I haven't heard the actual clip, though, if that makes sense.  You need the clip from the Jets.  Hard knocks.  Antonio Cromartie.  We got it?  You got it?  Or I have it?  Oh, I got it right here.  All right, good.  Sorry about that.  I'm still waking up.  He had a list of his eight kids, and four are three years old.  He's got four kids that are three years old.  What?  Have you heard this clip yet?  No. 
[00:13:30]  I hear it's amazing.  I'm going to hear this for the first time right now.  All right.  As soon as you leave and get home, you got to be that father figure.  You know, that husband.  What is wrong with you?  Yeah.  Alonzo, who is five.  I have Carys, who is three.  I have my junior, which is three.  I have my daughter, who just turned three as of yesterday. 
[00:14:00]  I have another son named Tyler.  That's when he turns three in December.  I have another daughter that was born October 16th named London.  Another daughter was born named Le'Vani, who is two years old.  And I have my newborn with my wife.  Her name is Jersey.  Jersey.  Jesus, fuck.  Give me a goddamn break.  You can afford it, don't you?  Yeah, he's going to pay for his kids. 
[00:14:30]  Hey, for the Jets.  Relax, this one wouldn't hurt you.  No, this one's not going to hurt you.  It does, it does.  It's just too fucking typical.  This isn't going to hurt you.  It's too typical.  I just don't like the name Jersey.  You don't like the name Jersey?  That's a terrible name for it.  Could you just fucking list how many fucking women there are involved in that?  What?  Maybe I had quadruples.  How many women?  Seven.  Seven fucking mothers?  In seven different states.  Just fucking enough already.  Here we go.  Enough.  Here we go.  But this is what I talk about. 
[00:15:00]  And I get accused of being a racist.  Stop doing this.  But it doesn't affect you.  It does.  You don't even hang out in public anymore.  It does affect me.  It does affect me.  There's no reason for this shit.  Could you not do this?  How are you supposed to be a father figure, like you said?  If I was about to go home and be a father figure.  When there's seven fucking women?  Why are you getting angry?  Keep your dick in your fucking pants. 
[00:15:30]  I think it's just funny.  Oh, it's not.  It's a funny clip that he has four three-year-olds.  You know, he could afford it.  That's all I care about.  It's funny.  But for everyone like him, there's a fucking thousand that are doing the same fucking thing.  And the mothers are sitting there on the government till.  Enough.  Holy shit.  Stay with one hose bag, could you?  I don't know if they're on the government till or just him.  What a dummy he is.  That's like seven different fucking payments.  Because it's just inherent.  Oh, Jesus.  Enough.  Let's be fucking honest here for a second. 
[00:16:00]  With athletes?  It's a giant problem.  It's a huge problem.  Oh, God.  Enough.  What?  Who are you referring to?  You know.  Who?  Maybe Larry King could say.  End person.  Thank you.  End person.  End person.  Could you fucking knock it off with that shit?  He's a father to these kids, though, Anthony.  Seven fucking mothers.  He knows their names, which is good news. 
[00:16:30]  Does he?  He seems like he's going to take care of them.  Jersey.  This is Pennsylvania.  And my son fucking Iowa.  God, it's infuriating.  I'm sorry.  It's fucking infuriating.  Why is it infuriating?  It doesn't affect you.  It does.  This is the breakdown.  You've got a great life.  This is one of the breakdowns of the fucking, uh, the social lattice of our country.  It really is. 
[00:17:00]  Ah, I'm not, I'm not apologetic.  No.  This is stupid.  You can't raise fucking a family like this and expect them to, uh, uh, uh, be normal.  And, and, and not end up a burden.  A burden!  Eight kids with seven women.  Eight kids with seven women.  Oh, we had one with two?  Wow.  And there's a possibility.  Two with one?  Excuse me?  And, uh, I would have to know the actual birthdays, but it looks like four women were pregnant at  the same time.  Exactly.  How many three-year-olds were there?  Four. 
[00:17:30]  Four three-year-olds.  And one that, I think, turned two.  So, this guy fucked and got pregnant four women in the same fucking year.  Well, you know, I want to calm you down.  Let's, let's play this again.  And let's, let's write down the ages, because now I'm confused.  How much do you think this guy makes a year?  He has a big contract?  I, I, I don't know his contract at all.  I have no idea.  Lucky that he can play a sport, because most of the time, you get the same shit, and they're 
[00:18:00]  not playing sports.  They're slinging dope.  Charlie's got more info on, uh, on, uh, Antonio.  I remember hearing this as well.  Charlie, this will help you out, Ant.  Listen.  Charlie.  Good morning.  When they signed him, they had to front him like 500,000, so he could pay his child support.  Oh, I remember that.  I do remember that.  Okay.  It's this guy.  Right, right.  That's the guy?  Yeah.  Yeah.  He was busy in the club with all the women.  I'm in the club.  There's a, who doesn't look at this? 
[00:18:30]  And say, that is a giant problem.  This guy should be, and when somebody says something, like a sports figure says something  irreverent, or, uh, irreverent, or, or stupid, or whatever the fuck, they always talk about,  well, you know, hey, hey, that's a role model.  Well, what are they doing?  Watch out, uh, the sports figures, they're saying something that the children are gonna listen to.  No one's calling this guy out on being an awful person, an awful role model, and, and perpetuating 
[00:19:00]  stereotypes, and, and, uh, and awful lifestyles.  He seems like he's doing the right thing as a father.  What?  He did the wrong thing as a father by fucking three more women when one was pregnant.  Holy mother of God.  And he's what?  26?  26.  He has more kids than anyone else in the NFL.  He has eight kids, and he's 26 years old, Ant.  What's wrong with that? 
[00:19:30]  He makes one million a year?  Free agent next year.  He better not get hurt.  Oh, brother.  If he gets hurt, then we're gonna have to deal with his kids, right, Ant?  No, no, no, believe me, we, we still do.  It's, it's, it's not him.  This is indicative.  It's just, I, I, I can't take this.  Why?  You're not out there with the people.  There's a, I'm out there enough.  You have built a compound. 
[00:20:00]  You're safe.  I cannot stay there.  You don't have to deal with any of this.  I have to venture out every so often.  You barely venture out.  Into, onto the, I'm like the road warrior.  Every so often, I have to hit the fucking streets.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Let's go over the ages again.  As soon as you leave and get home, you gotta be that father figure.  You know, that, that husband.  See, he's saying you gotta be that father figure.  Leave and go home?  Seven homes?  That husband.  He said you have to be a father figure.  Father figure.  And that husband, so that's good. 
[00:20:30]  Don't you realize he's not a father figure?  He's not?  He can't be with seven different places that he has to go to visit his kids?  Father figure.  You know, that, that husband.  Oh, wait a minute.  What's wrong with you?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Alonzo, who is five.  I have, um, Carys, who is three.  I have my, my junior, which is three.  I have a, my daughter, who just turned three as of yesterday. 
[00:21:00]  Um, I have another son named Tyler.  Yeah, so he turns three in December.  Another, uh, daughter that was born October 16th named London.  Uh, another daughter that was born named Leilani, who's, uh, two years old.  And, uh, I have, uh, my newborn with my wife.  Her name is Jersey.  All right, I got it figured out.  This is good news, Ant.  You'll like this.  He's got one five-year-old. 
[00:21:30]  Yeah.  And then he took a little break.  And he has four three-year-olds from four different women.  Four three-year-olds.  And then one of his kids was born October 16th.  When, when was this, uh, is this a new clip?  So what, uh, yeah.  Maybe there's a new tally.  All right, so October 16th, what were we talking?  Uh, 10 months, I guess.  So he has a 10-month-old, then he has a two-year-old and a newborn.  A newborn with his wife.  Wow.  Right.  You finally made the commitment, huh?  So that's not bad.  That is.  A newborn, a 10-month-old, a two-year-old, four three-year-olds, and one five-year-old. 
[00:22:00]  No one sees a problem with this.  No one sees that there is a huge problem with this.  I just see comedy.  Why isn't anyone calling him out on being an awful role model?  If you're gonna, if you're gonna jump on a sports figure or an entertainer for doing  or saying things, that, that people will be like, well, if the children heard that, you  know, they look up to this guy. 
[00:22:30]  Why not call him out and say, this is a horrible example to set for the youth, and, and, and  of course, the, you know, the black youth that look up to this guy, a horrible example.  That is true.  Like, if you do something stupid, like, if you, if you make a dumb public statement, or if  you're caught drunk driving, say.  Right.  And they'd say, well, this isn't illegal.  Of course, it's not illegal, but it is still a bad, eh.  It's a horribly irresponsible move on the part of, of an adult.  It's an, a horribly irresponsible way to live your life by fucking three more women and 
[00:23:00]  knocking them up.  This guy's a fertile motherfucker.  He might have more kids too, because he's been named in at least five paternity suits.  So, eight might not be the final hour.  How do you not see the comedy in this?  I got, look, look, I, I see the comedy.  Believe me, I see it.  But I also see another thing.  I don't think this happened a lot.  I see a post on a website I frequent. 
[00:23:30]  That's what I see.  Um, you, you can't post on the Drudge Report.  I know.  I, you know.  What's your screen name on that?  I don't have one.  I would not dare register or have a screen name.  I'm a coward.  But, but I do look at it.  I do check in.  They're cowards too, believe me.  Oh, I know.  None of them use their real names.  But not, you know what?  They have to register to be on that site.  What's that mean?  In order to post, you have to actually, like, register, um, a name and an email address  and stuff.  Every website. 
[00:24:00]  Some people don't really care on that site.  They really just.  Every website you have to do that though.  Yeah.  You have a fake name and an email address that you make up with Gmail.  Yeah, but if you're just posting about a dopey radio show, I don't think you're going  to get people, um, looking into your IP address and finding out who you are.  That website, uh, I think maybe, maybe some people might be looking, uh, looking at you.  That's right.  That's true.  Especially since, uh, we have a black president.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Fair enough.  Yes.  Yes. 
[00:24:30]  But, uh, you know, I, I, I look at all, all websites.  You might have up to five more kids.  So up to five more kids.  I, uh, I can't believe it.  Why isn't he being called out?  Would you, would you come across looking racist if you, if you called this guy out and said,  look, um, if you, if you said it's inherent, maybe, uh, if you came along, there's, there's  a huge problem with this.  And this is something that Bill Cosby's addressed in the past. 
[00:25:00]  Uh, this, this, this is a problem in the, uh, community.  Yeah.  But what if one of these guys was jamming his hands on someone's pants too?  I love Bill Cosby, but come on, Dr. Cos.  What if, uh, what if one of these kids grew up to be, you know, the president of the United  States?  Would you still feel the same way?  Oh God, I have four more years of being disappointed with looking forward to the next presidential  election.  Not if both candidates are black.  Ah, is that going to happen? 
[00:25:30]  Then you will.  Someday, yeah.  Yeah.  Of course it will.  What about, uh, does Hillary have any, was that more info on, uh, I'm sorry, Jimmy, before  you move on, has fathered, is this a, uh, wait.  All right.  So Antonio has fathered at least seven children with six women living in five states and has  been named in at least five paternity suits in the past two years.  Well, he is an asshole though.  Yeah.  So that's basically what a fucking idiot.  Holy shit.  What are you doing?  You don't pull out.  Yeah.  I don't, I don't really understand that mentality whatsoever.  The Jets had to give him 500,000 up front.  Well, they agreed to give him 500,000 up front. 
[00:26:00]  The contract that he signed in 2006 was for $12 million.  So he's obviously ran through that money.  Oh.  If he needs cash up front.  Well, that's good.  That's healthy for the, uh, economy.  Economy.  That's good.  Yeah.  We all know that.  Sure.  Spend, spend, spend is really good for everybody.  He needs, he needs money up front again.  No, no, no.  This was, uh, in March.  When's his contract up?  His contract is up at the end of the year, but NFL players don't start collecting until  the first week of the season.  So he wouldn't start collecting this year's contract. 
[00:26:30]  Until September.  And he needed the money, you know, five, six months ago.  Oh.  Okay.  Okay.  So he's kind of desperate for money.  Because he was at least 25,000 behind in child payments.  Unbelievable.  I don't understand the mentality.  Because when I was growing up and when I was in my twenties, I was scared shitless that  I'd get a girl.  He was not going to shake up, man.  Of course.  Like, out of my mind.  I mean, we've all had the, as guys, the phone call, I'm late.  And you would be out of your fucking mind.  Oh, the late call.  Oh, is that frightening. 
[00:27:00]  And obviously, you know, it didn't bother him in his twenties.  He didn't care.  No.  I can't wrap my head around that.  Because I would have anxiety attacks and all.  Like, oh my God, I might be a fucking father to this horse kid.  I've seen where it's the other way around in some communities.  The other way around where it's like you want to get the girls pregnant.  You want to have as many kids as you can by fucking 22.  So that way when you're gunned down in the street, they can fucking say, and he was a 
[00:27:30]  wonderful father to five children.  I don't understand the man.  It's like in the Bronx.  There's a book called Random Family, which is really good.  And it's about, she goes in the Bronx and she gets to know these Spanish people in  the Bronx.  They're poor.  But it's like the culture of having kids young is not frowned on.  And it's really weird how like by the time you're 17, a lot of 16, you're pregnant.  Oh, yeah.  Because everyone does it.  It's just like, that's the norm.  I don't get it.  I don't fucking get it. 
[00:28:00]  It's like the less money you have, the more it should be frowned on and get knocked  up early.  No, it's never the way.  And then responsible people that realize that maybe it's not time.  Maybe they can't afford kids.  Maybe they can't raise them in the proper environment.  They wait and don't have kids.  And then meanwhile, you know, on the government till, there's fucking five, six, seven kids  in poverty.  That's what I love when you see people bitching about their poverty. 
[00:28:30]  And meanwhile, they got seven kids surrounding them.  What are you doing?  You're fucking, you're, you're, you're making a burden on yourself and on society.  Society.  Sick of it.  Sick of it.  Yeah.  Ant's reference material, New Jack City.  Thanks, Pat from Monaki.  That's what I, yes.  That's.  What was that?  Pat from Monaki saying my reference materials, New Jack City, the movie.  What's he mean? 
[00:29:00]  Because I get my, I get my info from bad black movies from the eighties.  Menace to society.  Here we go.  Let's go to Noel in Massachusetts.  Noel.  Yeah.  What's up, brother?  Anthony.  Yeah.  You seem to think that bad fathers are usually black guys.  I mean, you could talk shit about this guy being a bad father, but when you say that he's  a black guy and that's why he's bad, that's kind of fucked up because your father was pretty  shitty. 
[00:29:30]  He was also black, sir.  You know what?  Let me.  Your father, your father would scream at you, call you a little faggot, make you cry.  He'd throw the spaghetti on the wall.  He couldn't even feed you sometimes.  So shitty fathers come from everywhere.  I agree with that, but let me tell you something.  My parents were married, and after three kids, they stopped having kids, and they, all of  my brothers and sisters, my brother and sister are from the same mother, and because you're 
[00:30:00]  white, because you're white.  Ooh.  No.  You don't see a problem with this.  And you don't see that, you don't see that it's more of a, I'm not talking about good fathers  or bad fathers here.  I'm talking about a man that's fathering children from fucking seven different mothers.  He's getting pussy.  He's getting pussy.  That isn't getting pussy, asshole.  That's knocking up women.  It's knocking up women, and it's a problem in the black community.  He has the money. 
[00:30:30]  He has the money, Anthony.  Obviously, he made it into the NFL.  See, you don't see anything wrong with this.  You don't see anything wrong with it.  I don't see anything wrong with it, but when you say, oh, he's black, you're making it  obvious, like, oh, yeah, he's black, that's why.  Yeah, yeah.  And I think, I think fathering children from multiple mothers is a problem.  It's a problem.  It doesn't raise children in a healthy environment.  You fucked.  You're just lucky they didn't get pregnant.  Otherwise, you'd have to get pregnant.  Shut up, asshole.  What do you think?  I'm burying my dick and cumming in every chick I fucking sleep with? 
[00:31:00]  Stop it.  Stop it.  You should fuck fat bitches.  Stop it.  I don't fuck fat bitches.  I've never fucked a fat bitch aside from your fucking cunt mother.  Maybe your cunt mother was a fat bitch when I slipped it up her fucking asshole and let  my hot load loose in her fucking asshole.  Your fat mother.  Your fat fucking mother.  That's who I fucked.  The only fat bitch I fucked was your mother.  Your fucking ugly fat cunt mother. 
[00:31:30]  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up, Burton.  Shut up, Burton.  It's not even 7 a.m.  Go fuck yourself.  I fucked your fat ass mother.  That fucking cunt.  Your mother's a cunt and she's fat.  I fucked it.  She swallowed my load.  She swallowed it.  All right, Nathaniel.  I love you.  All right.  Take it easy, man.  I remember when this show was just fun. 
[00:32:00]  It just gets so childish.  It fucked your mother.  It's very funny.  Christ almighty.  Let's say hi to Ryan in Atlanta.  Ryan.  Hey, love you.  Love the show.  Thank you.  Why does it always got to go to a white black thing, though?  Then again, how much do you want to bet that even though this guy's making $12 million,  he spends every one of his kids on welfare?  I don't know.  See, I didn't say that.  All I'm saying is this is a deeper problem than just this guy and these women and these 
[00:32:30]  children.  It's a problem that has been talked about before.  I'm not the first one to bring this up.  Believe me, there's a problem.  There's a problem with absentee fathers and a problem with multiple pregnancies from multiple  women, and I'm not saying it's only a black problem, but it's another instance of a disproportionate  number.  And no one's addressing the issue except maybe Bill Cosby and me. 
[00:33:00]  Wow.  You're in good company.  I know.  Later, shit, Dick.  Why do you get the women pregnant?  Pull out, come in her asshole, or use a rubber.  Make her suck it like a pudding.  Put your asshole on her mouth.  Make her lick it like a pudding.  Rudy is pregnant by a man with another child from another woman's room. 
[00:33:30]  Put a little hat over half of her face and make her suck it like the guy from the commercial.  I sound like Ted.  Ted Cosby.  Ted Cosby.  Do you get straight from being pregnant?  I certainly don't.  Come here.  Let's go to Buffalo.  Brian has something to add here.  Brian.  Hey, what's up, guys?  What's up?  Willis McGahee, when he was in Buffalo, I think he had like nine or ten paternity suits before 
[00:34:00]  he went to the Baltimore Ravens.  So he had like 10 or 12 women pregnant when he was in Buffalo.  Wow.  He was only there for like two years.  I'll say it again.  I bring it back to the simple point.  As a man, I don't understand that mentality.  No.  You know, yeah, sure.  I mean, condoms aren't fun, but I mean, you can't do what these guys are doing.  It takes so many fucking chances.  You want children.  That's what they... 
[00:34:30]  So these guys just want fucking children all over the country?  Right.  A lot of these guys want to get women pregnant, want to have spread their seed, I guess,  as many women as they can, knock them up.  They're not regretful about it.  It's not a problem.  It's a great thing.  It's a great thing.  They're like, wow, another fucking kid.  This is great.  I don't get it.  He's like...  I don't...  I bang chicks, but it's like, pull out.  Yeah.  And like, fuck, we're coming there.  What are you doing?  Do something. 
[00:35:00]  Like, how could you get that many...  Because the guy who said, oh, he's just getting pussy about it.  But I haven't fucked that many women in different states and come in all of them.  Yeah, yeah.  So what do you...  Like, when you're about to blow, just pull it out.  Yeah.  You're decreasing the odds.  Did you guys read about, like...  It was three weeks ago in the paper in Miami where the guy wanted to teach his son how to box.  So he put on boxing gloves and he went 15 minutes with his son.  But his son was only two.  And his... 
[00:35:30]  But his son ended up being brain dead and obviously he's dead now.  And, you know, the guy's 23 and...  But he wanted to teach him how to box.  And...  What a great story for 6.45 in the morning.  Thanks.  Cute story.  Really nice.  Really brings the comedy back to the show.  Cute story.  Oh, somebody...  What is this on line 6?  The guy doesn't...  He says, I don't know what I'm talking about.  Oh, shit.  G and...  Oh, sorry.  G and D.C.  G. 
[00:36:00]  Yeah.  Hi, G.  What's up?  Yeah.  Anthony.  Yes, sir.  Y'all know...  It's the women.  It's not the men.  I mean, think about...  Like the dude...  Mom knew was coming in.  He...  He's right.  If you were fucking them...  If they want to get pregnant, they're going to get pregnant.  No, no.  They're not holding their...  Your dick inside them.  I think you're not being honest with that.  Like the other caller was saying, I think you come to a lot of bitches, too.  They just...  And if they did get pregnant, they probably had an abortion because they had more goals. 
[00:36:30]  It's the women who they...  That's what they do.  I mean, I guess they're losers and they just...  A baby kind of like sets their life up.  So what do they grab his fucking ass with their legs and fucking hold him inside while he blows a load?  Especially if he's an athlete.  Why not?  I'm telling you some good shit.  They have this shit on the internet that tells you when you ovulate.  So some of them bitches, they know exactly when they ovulate.  And they can like...  I mean, you know...  You know, get dick hogged and give you some pussy.  Wasn't ovulate one of his kids? 
[00:37:00]  Oh.  Is that one of his kids' names?  That might be the 10-month-old.  Is that the 10-month-old?  I'm not really sure.  Gee, you're basically saying there's not a lot of black girls at the abortion clinic.  Exactly.  And when I was growing up, a lot of white girls were having abortions.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Exactly.  Oh, they take up her car.  The white girls on birth control more and all that.  On birth control.  You've got the radio show?  I mean, look into that.  I mean, I'm telling you.  When I heard that dude say that, I'm like right on.  I've been saying that for years.  I mean, you sit up there like y'all, like you said, you would have had a bunch of... 
[00:37:30]  If you was fucking black people in the black community, you would have a bunch of kids, too.  And you know it.  And if all y'all sit back and let their laugh, and if you think about it...  No.  I wouldn't be.  I wouldn't be.  Your boy just said that we all got that phone call.  All that shit.  And all of a sudden, they're agreeing.  So, come on, man.  Be well about it.  After the second three-year-old, don't you think you'd be like, maybe I shouldn't...  Right.  But I'm okay.  Yeah, I agree with you there.  I'm just saying.  But what I'm saying is, if it was white chicks, it wouldn't even be that second three-year-old. 
[00:38:00]  Because they would have had an abort...  First of all, they would have been on birth control, most likely.  Because, you know, they're going to college.  They got shit to do.  But the...  That's what I'm...  You see what I'm saying?  You don't look into it.  Well, I'm saying there's a problem.  But, gee...  I'm saying that's a problem.  I like your phone call, but all I would add is the fact that then the black guy should  know that this is the mentality of the black woman.  So, they should be protecting themselves a little bit, no?  When they're young, they don't know that.  Sometimes it takes a long time for them to figure that out.  And then look into the shit. 
[00:38:30]  I've been saying it for years.  Look at that great Peruv dude.  I mean, you know, look what he did.  You see what I'm saying?  And there's a lot of that shit going on.  Yeah.  And they didn't keep any kind of statistics, I'm telling you.  A lot of moms that come up missing, like the mom, you know, it's because of that.  You know, the women maybe want to get knocked up, but any broke woman wants to get knocked  up, especially by a guy who makes a lot of money.  Exactly.  But how is the guy...  Look, I hate condoms, but when you have that kind of money, how are you not wearing bags?  Or how are you not pulling out? 
[00:39:00]  I mean, I understand once in a while you're going to knock a chick up.  It happened.  It's like it's an accident.  But fucking seven, six different women, you're blowing every load inside.  Yeah, but you know what?  I could...  And you're talking about, that's an exception, so I don't think it's that many with seven,  but I mean, I think it's a lot with two.  You know what?  I could...  It's six women.  In the country, even white guys, they got like two, you know, two mothers of children.  Sure.  I could sort of relate. 
[00:39:30]  I got to jump in.  I could sort of relate.  You're a big cock.  I had three speeding tickets in three different states within a month.  Oh, okay.  And after I got the first one, I'm like, you know what?  I better fucking slow down.  Slow down.  And this is a true story.  When we're living in Boston, I had a speeding ticket in New York, New Hampshire, and Massachusetts  all at the same fucking time.  You didn't just keep driving into ditches.  You started avoiding them.  That was the point.  But after the first, I'm like, I can't get another speeding ticket.  I got another two after that.  Yeah.  So maybe you can't help yourself, is what I'm saying.  Yeah. 
[00:40:00]  Yeah.  Well, I mean, we all know that pussy is the thing.  You were talking about the dentists who, when they look laying on the table, they see  that pussy, and they do crazy shit.  You know, that pussy do amazing things.  Oh, yeah, it does.  It talks to you, man.  It pulls you in.  You make jokes about them women all the time.  Well, but regardless of the guy or the woman, I'm talking about just in the community,  there seems to be a problem with absentee fathers and multiple pregnancies with multiple women.  Do your job to help the community. 
[00:40:30]  I am.  I'm speaking out right now.  We need better schools so there's not a desperation in the ghetto.  There's nothing to do with schools or desperation.  It's fucking just knock it off.  There's a desperation in the ghetto.  It's knock it off.  You can't just...  Knock it off.  That's not a good platform.  You can't just go to the ghetto and say, knock it off.  Yes, you can, because anybody with any sense would know what knock it off means.  No, I'm going to tell you this.  Check this out.  The government, some of them chicks, think about it, the ballplayers.  If them chicks, if, you know, you've got a McDonald's dude that was, like, hideous, 
[00:41:00]  and the chicks fucked him and whatever, and he's a loser or whatever, a crackhead,  do you think she's going to have that baby?  If the government said they're not giving her any money, they set this shit up a long time ago.  And if you look at it, I'm telling you some good shit.  Sometimes their mother's on it, their mother's mother's on it, their mother's mother's  mother's on it, all that kind of shit.  And so the chick don't know any better, and she's lazy, and so, like, you know, like,  the baby is the answer.  The thing is, but sir, why are the guys not pulling? 
[00:41:30]  I get everything you're saying, but the bottom line is, look, I've gotten pussy.  I know how wonderful it feels, but how are you not pulling out and shooting it on the  stomach?  How do you not do that?  Well, I mean, I don't get that, because I was scared shitless.  Everyone knows that you're going to knock a girl up if you comment her.  Everyone knows that.  This guy's not a dumb guy.  He's an athlete.  And it was put in the back of my head.  You knock up a girl at an early age, it would basically ruin your life.  Yeah.  Ruin your life. 
[00:42:00]  Right.  So that prevented me from doing just that.  I was scared.  I was out of my mind scared about that.  Why don't you just get your dick sucked?  But you know what?  Oh, please.  We all know that.  It doesn't happen.  And you watch, what is it called?  17 and Pregnant, 16 and Pregnant, whatever it's called.  That's all white broads.  Oh, I know.  So it is happening.  Was that MTV?  It's happened with the white broads, too.  Of course they only show white broads.  Believe me, I know there's plenty of white trash out there doing the same thing. 
[00:42:30]  I'm just talking about disproportionate numbers.  You've got to admit, the white people have a better opportunity.  Come on.  You've got to admit.  True opportunity for what?  To become president?  Oh, that's right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, you're being funny, but yeah, that's true.  But I'm saying, what I'm talking about, Dan Kirk, if your whole family went to college, 
[00:43:00]  you expect to go to college.  If you had a little boy, he might be a DJ.  You see what I'm saying?  If you were a basketball player, if you had a little boy, he might be a basketball player.  You know, you're kind of like, you know.  Are you implying, sir, that Jaden Smith is only doing well as an actor because of Will Smith  being his father?  Are you implying that he hasn't paid his dues at age 12 and is already doing well?  No kidding.  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  But, dude, y'all know what I'm saying.  Yeah.  Like I said, y'all want to be honest.  Go ahead and think about all the bitches that you fuck.  Just like we go get a date, Seth. 
[00:43:30]  Like Chris Rock said, you think about all the questionable bitches you've been with.  I mean, y'all motherfuckers going to be honest about fucking.  I mean, all the way around.  Like the gays.  You know, all that age shit.  You know, motherfuckers going to be lying about that.  But, dude, I'm a pervert.  I've fucked a lot of different girls.  Yeah.  And I've been very, very crazy at points in my life.  Yeah.  But I always kind of knew.  You know.  About pulling out.  Just for financial reasons.  It was like, I don't want to have to pay some.  The doctor says pulling out don't work.  It does.  Well, it's not a guarantee. 
[00:44:00]  It's not a guarantee, but it helps.  You get some leakage before you pull out.  It all depends on.  Some seepage.  It all depends on how long before you.  That moment of truth.  Right when you pull out.  Yeah.  You want it to be really good.  Don't go for that extra pump.  No, no.  Don't go for the extra fucking.  Don't go for that extra pump.  Don't bury it deep right before you pull out.  It drastically reduces the odds if you pull out.  Yeah.  I think if she's ovulating.  Then you got the doctor.  If she's ovulating.  They don't take.  Like I said, it has more to do with if it's that day. 
[00:44:30]  I think, you know, chances are you're not going to hit that day.  All right.  Look, look, look.  You convinced me.  It's not a problem in the black community.  There's not a bunch of women that have children from multiple fathers and fathers that have  children from multiple mothers.  There's not children being raised by grandmothers and all that shit.  And a disproportionate number in the black community.  You're right.  I'm wrong.  Everyone.  Yeah, he didn't say any of that.  He was explaining why it's happening.  He's saying it's the women. 
[00:45:00]  I don't care if it's the men or the women.  What?  Women aren't.  The women aren't black.  The men aren't black.  It's a problem.  I'm just saying a problem in the black community.  Earlier you were making all your jokes.  Direct this whole was the man.  That's all I'm saying.  I was saying it's a problem in the black community.  It's a good situation.  It is.  And the guy, it's the guy's, it's the guy's job at the point of fucking to not come inside  the girl.  That's right.  And I'm sure he got to that point.  Certain of them, they got all them sevens and all that.  And that is ridiculous.  I'm talking about two and three. 
[00:45:30]  I'm saying that two, and sometimes they might feel like, oh shit, my life's ruined anyway.  So I might as well have more kids.  All right, gee, thank you.  It's a good phone call.  How many kids do you have, by the way?  Two.  And how old are you?  37.  See, it's not every black guy.  I didn't say every.  Give them time.  Don't put words in my mouth.  You used the word and heard.  No, no, no.  There's a problem.  All right, gee, thank you.  I said disproportionate number. 
[00:46:00]  Of course there's people that are responsible.  This next phone call will calm you down and make you a little happier.  All right.  Tony in Cleveland.  Tony.  How's it going, guys?  Hey, Tony.  Hey, um, third guy that played for the Cavs and also played for the Celtics.  His name was Sean Kemp.  I know you've heard of him.  Sure.  I think he played for the, uh, Supersonics too, right?  I think he played for Seattle as well, yeah.  Yeah.  Didn't he come in one day or no?  Sean Kemp, no.  No, that was Chris, uh, I'm sorry, but who came in that basketball player?  Oh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh 
[00:46:30]  flat broke, and every one of his  kids are now on the government's dime.  Just like this Cromartie's going to end up 
[00:47:00]  because if he got, I mean, he's already broke.  His career, if you look  at the average corner in the NFL,  he's got maybe two to three years left.  And then after that, what does he  give a shit? We're all going to end up supporting him  anyways. Yeah, it's not like he's going to be  playing in the NFL for the next 18  years to get all these kids through  high school.  To blame the woman  for him blowing loads  blaming a rape victim for not keeping her legs  tightened up when a guy jumps her.  Yeah, that argument, I didn't buy 
[00:47:30]  that whole argument with  it's the women's fault.  I don't get it.  You know, I've had plenty of chicks when I was  single going, hey, just go ahead, pop a load in me.  It's good. It's like, no, no, it's not good.  I'll just leave it on your belly. Have a nice day.  Have a nice day.  Yeah, of course you want to do it.  Feels great.  But you need a little responsibility there.  Thank you, sir. Let's go to Bill in New Hampshire.  Everyone reacting. Bill!  Hey!  Hey, you know, 100% of people being  responsible and everything, they're called white people. 
[00:48:00]  That's what it is.  The white people are the responsible ones.  Well, there's plenty of white trash, too.  Believe me, I've seen enough of that.  But I do think  there's a disproportionate number.  Absolutely.  And like the other caller there, the guy down in D.C.  there that was calling, he was trying to rationalize everything.  Blaming the women, blaming the government,  for giving them money. I mean, if we don't give them money,  they're going to lie in the streets.  They're going to go bogus and, you know,  burn their own neighborhood down.  They don't even go to somebody else's neighborhood. 
[00:48:30]  They burn their own down.  Do I sound like this?  Yeah, well, this is one of your guys.  Do I sound like this sometimes?  This is one of the guys.  This is part of your cult.  Maybe I have to...  Let's say hi to Dave in Virginia.  Dave!  Yeah, I was a football player back in the 80s  at University of Texas for four years.  I'm a white guy.  And the black guys used to give me shit for four years.  You must be shooting blanks.  You must be shooting blanks.  Why you ain't got no kids?  Why you ain't got no kids?  That's a cultural thing. 
[00:49:00]  And you were 20, 21, whatever, right?  Yeah, there's something cultural there.  I don't know what it is.  All right, brother.  Let's go to Ron in Illinois.  Ron.  Hey, fellas.  Happy birthday, Johnny.  Hi, Ron.  I agree with Anthony wholeheartedly.  That phone call that you guys had just by cheap pissed me off.  I am so sick and tired of the African-Americans  talking about how me, the white guy,  has got so many extra fucking advantages.  I work 16 fucking hours a day.  Everything that my family has, I fucking work for it. 
[00:49:30]  It's not because the government's giving it to me.  It's not because my fucking skin is white.  Enough of conscience sitting on the N-word  and start concentrating on the fucking community.  My wife's a schoolteacher,  and the shit she comes with on a daily basis is mind-blowing.  It's literally a game to find out if there's actually an African-American family  in the school that has a fucking married family.  They're all single. 
[00:50:00]  The kids running the neighborhoods,  our community in which we lived in in the last 20 years,  we've actually had to build on to our fucking juvenile hall  and our jail system as the population of the African-Americans  has increased in our freaking area of the state.  It's insane.  Everyone, no one's addressing the issue.  Yeah.  I think Anthony's calling it.  Well, you can't, or you're labeled a racist  if you even address the issue. 
[00:50:30]  No one wants to talk about it.  No one wants to see it,  even though it's right in front of your face.  So we just sit there, and the problem continues.  That's great.  So have a good day.  All right.  Wow, the phones are just...  My God.  Talk about race.  The phones fucking go crazy.  Oh, I know.  The phones...  You know why?  Because you're not allowed to talk about it at work.  You're not allowed to have honest discussions about it.  No, you can't.  I mean, this is obviously an honest, open forum  wherever anybody wants to say whatever the fuck they want. 
[00:51:00]  Go ahead.  You have this talk in an office,  and everybody will act like they don't understand  that there's a difference between black and white.  Even better or worse.  But no, it's exactly...  No, you just can't tell the truth.  It's not just a skin color thing.  People think like,  oh, wow, color of the skin makes such a big difference.  It's like, no.  Color of the skin makes no difference.  It's the culture.  It's the difference in how we look at things  based on, you know, whatever.  Based on people having to go through 
[00:51:30]  a lot of hardship and bullshit years ago.  And, you know, I just...  I don't understand it.  I don't understand where the lack of responsibility comes from.  I just don't get it.  Well, for the women...  Let's just say for the women,  how do you not keep such a big cock inside you?  Jesus.  No, I'm not trying to say...  But I'm saying, like, when you have something probably that big and thick  inside your body,  how do you let it out?  You just don't want it pulling out?  I don't mean to come off sounding weird, 
[00:52:00]  but, like, if you're laying back  and just say there's a big cock inside you  and you feel it swelling and ready to unrelease...  How do you open your legs and say,  take that big thing out of me?  Take that out.  You've got to take the cock.  Of course.  He's a fat throbbing.  Again, I don't want to, you know,  sound like I'm being too homoerotic here,  but I'm saying, like, you know,  who among us could push such a big, beautiful cock out of them?  Oh, my God.  I doubt you could. 
[00:52:30]  I know I couldn't.  I'm just saying, if I was a woman.  Help me.  No.  I don't know.  Who is this?  Why is my picture up?  Evan, Evan, New Hampshire, I think.  This will be...  We're going to try to start moving on.  Yes.  Jimmy's got me all worked up.  No shit.  Hey, if you want a prime example of what's going on,  just watch the first 15 minutes of the movie Idiocracy.  Oh, yeah.  With Jerry Cruz, president.  Yeah, yeah.  What?  Idiocracy.  I hear...  Yeah, movies.  What's that movie about? 
[00:53:00]  I don't know.  I hear about that movie from time to time.  What's the movie about?  What is it?  Guys that are...  A guy gets kind of frozen, like cryogenically frozen,  and wakes up, like, I don't know, 100 or 500 years in the future.  Way the fuck in the future.  And everything has just kind of regressed.  Like, everyone has just become completely retarded,  but somehow managed to function some kind of society.  But it's a society of just morons.  Of just retards.  That's where we're headed now.  Watch.  Don't use the R word, Danny.  Oh, I know. 
[00:53:30]  I'm very insensitive.  Yeah.  I'm sorry.  Jennifer Aniston got in trouble for using the R word.  You know what?  Why don't we do that after the break?  Yeah.  Yeah, we should.  Because this R word, N word, F word is just ridiculous.  C word.  C word has been added.  M word.  What?  Midget.  Oh, that's right.  M word.  They don't like midget.  M word.  Is that it, though?  Are those the biggies?  For now.  What if you have an NM?  Wow.  Well, then you're better off having an R.  An NMR.  Too bad you're not an F.  You could have just stuck it in an A. 
[00:54:00]  Saved yourself a lot of trouble.  Letters are fun.  I want to attack the media on this one, though.  Yeah, that's ridiculous.  Oh, I don't.  When you say the N word or whatever, you're telling everyone what you mean.  Everyone knows what you mean.  And you're giving that word way more power.  Yeah.  End person.  If we all just said all these words, it wouldn't be as powerful.  Is that too basic of thinking right there?  It's a diversion. 
[00:54:30]  Like when the NAACP, I think it was after Michael Richards had his mouth down.  Look at that.  Construction workers vowing not to work on Ground Zero Moss.  Yeah, that's obvious.  But that was brought up on this very program yesterday.  Yeah, it's very obvious.  Who the fuck would?  But they're also going to have a – they're going to use a non-union workforce, I'm thinking.  Oh, the giant rats can be out there.  It will be out.  And it will be an ugly scene, I hope.  I hope it's an ugly scene.  It will get ugly.  There's enough fucking teamsters and guys like that that have friends and family who are terribly affected by this. 
[00:55:00]  We'll talk about it, I guess, after.  But just the wife of this imam saying, when will Muslims be looked at as mainstream Americans?  Okay, that's a good question.  How about when you start thinking like mainstream Americans and realize how shitty this is?  Yes.  You want to be seen as mainstream Americans?  Say, you know what?  We have the right to do it, but 9-11 hurt us too.  We don't want to make anybody's wounds worse.  We're going to move a few blocks away.  We'd like to invite you all down. 
[00:55:30]  How about that?  Yeah, yeah.  Why am I yelling?  I'm sorry.  Open yourself up a little bit.  Shouldn't yell.  A little transparency.  But no.  We're building it here.  Why can't we be accepted as –  We won't back down.  Yeah, good.  Don't.  Hope no one builds a fucking thing.  That's what I hope.  Oh, they'll get it built.  I know.  They'll find some –  They'll find some scab labor.  Oh, my God.  Scab labor.  The big rat will be out there.  There'll be a bunch of rats.  Yeah.  Blow up rats.  People with fucking baseball bats. 
[00:56:00]  Yeah, I think it might go –  It's going to be old school.  I think it might go old school.  Old school union stuff.  I think it might go old school.  It's not going to just be –  I want to go back to Norma Ray.  Yeah.  I don't think it's going to be just a calm gray rat.  Nah.  Not blown up.  We need the teamsters on this one.  I think they're going to go old school on this one.  All right.  But we have to talk about Jennifer Aniston using the R word and how ridiculous it is and blah, blah, blah.  R word.  And also –  Oh.  Hold on a minute.  Oh.  Hold on a minute.  Well.  Just want to do this.  What have we got here? 
[00:56:30]  Just want to do this.  Why did they call that the hair club for men?  Every one of those fuckers is bald.  After the break.  The virus.  Sirius XM.  You're listening to O.P. and Anthony.  Happy birthday, Robert Plant. 
[00:57:00]  Wow.  62.  I thought he was older, actually, to be honest with you.  And maybe he's padding.  That's also his hat size. 
[00:57:30]  Fat head.  Big lunk head.  He really is.  62 years old.  Yeah.  No waiting for the skull.  Oh, Nanny McPhee returns.  79% positive reviews.  What?  Going to the movies this weekend, Ant.  Why would I?  Good boy.  Why would I?  You don't want to get the bed bugs.  I was in the theater last night watching a little – 
[00:58:00]  I hope your theater at home gets bed bugs in it.  You know how happy I'd be?  Would that suck?  Oh, God.  Just bed bugs infestation.  That won't happen because you don't invite those people to your house.  That's right.  That was so nice sitting in there, nice and air-conditioned.  No one yelling.  What did you say?  I was just watching Gladiator.  A little Gladiator on the big screen.  Some people over.  Go to that website. 
[00:58:30]  There's a website called Athletes with Illegitimate Kids, I guess.  Oh.  And they have three categories.  The heavyweights, the middleweights, and the lightweights, whatever.  The heavyweights are the ones that really fucked things up?  Yeah.  Just to finish our discussion from earlier.  Uh-huh.  Wow.  I'm surprised about that one.  Jesus.  Which one?  Holyfield.  He's one of the heavyweights.  Holyfield.  Nine illegitimate kids.  Holyfield has nine – wow, really?  Oh, shit. 
[00:59:00]  Wow.  We talked about Sean Kemp.  Willie Anderson, who used to play for the Spurs, has nine.  How many – can I just ask, how many of those guys are white?  I don't know.  One, two, three, four, five out of the seven.  Five out of the seven.  Yep.  Are white.  Are you sure?  No.  They're all black.  Are they?  Unfortunately, I have to admit that to you.  I want to know.  Are they?  I have no idea.  Yes.  I'm just asking.  Maybe Jason. 
[00:59:30]  Jason seems like a white – nope.  Nope.  Oh, baby.  Travis Henry, which we should have mentioned, yes.  A lot of people talk about Travis Henry.  I think he had nine kids with nine women.  See, he's on the heavyweight list of this website.  Charles Rodgers might be white.  NFL draft bust.  No.  No one sees this as a problem?  Not only is he not white, he's very black.  He was very, yeah, okay.  Vlad Guerrero.  Danny just keeps putting – no. 
[01:00:00]  Danny just keeps putting the names in the search engine and looking up images and –  Greg Miner's not.  I know.  All right.  Let's see.  No.  No.  We're Googling him.  Not white.  I knew Greg Miner would be white.  Chad.  Chad Johnson.  Come on.  Chad.  Come on.  Johnson.  That's not –  That's not –  No.  See, that's –  That could be –  Oh.  Boy, not white.  No, that's –  You know who Chad Johnson is, don't you?  Yeah, Shannon Sharp is obviously –  That was a joke.  All right.  Mike Bibby.  That's a white guy.  No, it is white.  That's a black guy.  Oh.  It's Henry Bibby's son who was one of the Knicks. 
[01:00:30]  Bibby's a dumb name.  It's horrible.  It's a stupid name.  Although it looks like Henry might have married a white woman.  Although Henry Bibby was a bit of a light-skinned black guy.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's some old knowledge from my Loving the Knicks days.  Gary Sheffield?  I can tell you that.  He's a black guy.  Played with the Yankees.  Yeah, we know that one.  Hey, but go to the number one, and I did not know this.  Good old Calvin Murphy.  Calvin Murphy?  Calvin Murphy was very short and played in the NBA.  Played with the Cavaliers. 
[01:01:00]  Played with a bunch of other teams.  But I think he mostly played for the Cavaliers as far as his career went, I believe.  Damn.  Wait, the Rockets, too?  Damn.  How many years were the Cavaliers?  That's old school.  That's going to matter for five people.  A lot of kids.  But how many kids does he have?  Fourteen.  By nine women.  Fourteen kids.  Nine women.  Calvin put it deep.  Wow, he sunk it.  Jesus, he never came without hitting a spine.  What the fuck?  What did he fucking...  He had a tube from his cock into the uterus.  A fucking womb-connecting kit. 
[01:01:30]  Oh, womb-buster Calvin.  I don't get it.  I don't either.  Oh, this is a very good question coming in.  Mikey in Wisconsin as we move on.  Mike.  Hey, man.  How's it going?  Welcome aboard, Mike.  Hey.  How are they going to feel if they get the mosque or the nest or whatever you want to call it built before ground zero?  Oh, well, if the mosque stays in that area, and I still think that we're just yelling and screaming over nothing, I think this thing will be moved. 
[01:02:00]  Oh.  Too many people have come out against it.  Even Democrats have broken ranks with stupid Obama.  I really believe some deal will be made, and it'll be worth their while to move the mosque.  So, but, if that's not the case, it'll absolutely be built before ground zero.  Yep.  Yeah, what's it going to look like?  The world's largest 7-Eleven?  What's that, sir?  What's it going to look like?  We heard you!  Thank God. 
[01:02:30]  God damn it, is that great every time.  Hey, Brandon's on the line.  Brandon.  Brandon.  Well, hello.  There he is.  Brandon.  Yeah.  Hey, what do you got for the show?  Hey, yeah, I was going to tell y'all to check out Antonio Cromartie from the Jets.  I was watching the Hard Knocks last night.  Man, this guy was just rattling kids off left and right that he's got.  It was hard to even name him.  Who is this guy? 
[01:03:00]  He's a cornerback for the Jets.  No, I haven't heard of him before.  Harold Carmichael?  He played with the Eagles.  No, Antonio Cromartie.  Oh.  I'm a Jets fan.  I know a little bit about him.  Cornerback, sure.  So what's the problem with him?  Does he have two kids?  Oh, he's got a ton of kids.  Like I said, I was watching him name them off and, oh, man.  How many?  Oh, really?  Can we get that?  Maybe we could get that audio.  Yeah, that would be a good clip to have.  Of him naming them off.  What was some of the names?  Do you remember?  Oh, man.  I really couldn't remember some of them. 
[01:03:30]  I know his new kid's name is Jersey.  They're all adults.  What?  Are they all adults?  What's that?  Are they all adults?  Yeah.  How old are the kids?  Oh, they're all pretty young.  I know about four of them were three years old.  What?  No.  Yeah.  That's impossible.  What's the clip from Hard Knocks?  I think it was the first episode.  No.  Yeah, I don't know if we have time to play that clip today.  But that's definitely...  That would be perfect for this subject we're talking about.  Yeah, absolutely.  Oh, yeah, man.  I got in the truck heading to work.  And like I said, I just saw it yesterday. 
[01:04:00]  I figured y'all would like to hear that.  Yeah, I think we would like to hear that, sir.  Yeah, wouldn't we?  Absolutely.  Wouldn't we?  It might kick off a discussion.  All right, Brandon.  Thank you for that.  All right, guys.  Appreciate it.  Thanks.  We'll find that clip.  Thank you.  Listen to the replay later.  All right.  You'll love it.  Yeah, so you can hear yourself, right?  Yeah.  Sounding like a complete...  All right, Brandon.  Thank you.  How many vacations is this asshole president going to go on?  I know.  That got me today, too.  Another one.  Another 10-day vacation.  He was just in the Gulf vacationing. 
[01:04:30]  And now he's in Maine or wherever he goes vacationing.  And his fucking wife was just away for $375,000.  What the fuck?  This guy takes more vacations than anyone.  Jesus.  Than any...  With so much shit going on.  Whatever.  It's annoying.  I just said they would have killed Bush for that and fine, but fuck him, man.  They used to give Bush a lot of shit for his vacations.  So who took more vacation days?  I don't know.  Obama.  Obama?  Obama's absolutely taken more vacation than any friggin' president I've heard of. 
[01:05:00]  It's crazy.  I doubt it.  Yeah?  Yeah, I doubt that.  I think they take about the same amount of days.  I don't know.  Bush took at least the last two years off.  Yeah, he went on vacation somewhere.  Yeah, exactly, Chip.  All right, what do you want to do?  You want to do this thing? 
[01:05:30]  Yeah, I want to do that thing.  Or you want to do the Jennifer Aniston thing?  Which one do you want to do?  Uh, what do you got in your hand there?  Uh, I got a thing.  Is this quality comedy?  A thing.  I just got a thing.  Let's hear the thing.  All of the thing or another piece of the thing?  The other, let's just say that the opening line to the ting was stolen.  All right, so why don't we play another part of the thing?  Why didn't they call that the hair club for men?  Every one of those fuckers is bald.  No clue whatsoever. 
[01:06:00]  Mind if I talk about sex for a minute?  Yeah.  Do you mind?  You lying sex and shit, you won't want to hear about it.  The thing.  Let's just keep the thing over here for a little longer.  No, no, no, no, no.  A little longer.  I want to hear more.  A little longer.  I got to hear more.  Of course you want to hear more.  That's why I keep the thing over here.  I feel so, like...  Uncomfortable?  I'm a little uncomfortable, Jimmy.  You should see it.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Can you bring it up?  What's with the accent?  I know. 
[01:06:30]  Let's just keep the thing over there for a little while.  I got to hear it.  I really want to keep people in their cars and trucks today.  They don't care.  They'll get right out and listen to it later.  No, they won't.  Oh, I...  Oh.  They don't care.  Oh.  No, they care.  What the hair club for men?  That's an Otto and George joke.  Stolen.  Rocketing you who?  That was...  Oh, no.  No way.  Oh, my God.  Jimmy.  Is this the...  That's it.  Is this what I got?  It's the same thing? 
[01:07:00]  Jimmy is wearing MC Hammer pants.  That's...  I'll tell you what that is.  It's 1990.  There was a contest for Bud Light, and I think I was too...  They only taped me for, like...  How long was it taped?  Two minutes?  Two minutes.  They taped me for two and a half minutes, and then just turned off the recorder, because  I was too dirty.  It was...  Ugh.  What is with the pants?  I always wore those.  MC Hammer pants?  I thought they were cool.  The big fucking puffy pants.  And then you got a little Bud Light t-shirt on.  Look at what a skinny little gent you wore. 
[01:07:30]  Very depressing.  Big head of hair.  I can't get the audio up.  Oh, my.  Is it you or me?  If it's me, fucking Mars is going to get a beating.  That?  I think it's only one channel.  I have no channels.  You look hysterical.  It doesn't look like you.  No.  It looks like somebody who could be like, wow, that looks like a young Guido Jimmy.  I know.  A little Jersey idiot.  You are a Jersey idiot.  You got to put this online.  I'm going to.  I'm having it done. 
[01:08:00]  Wow.  I haven't found a bunch of old shit.  I'm going to show a progression of how awful I got.  This?  You want to sync it up?  Oh, it's terrible.  I can't hear it over here.  I can't hear it either.  It's in one channel because it's.  What happened?  I would hold the.  I would never take the mic out of the stand, but the Jersey accent is really embarrassing.  You want to play this now?  You might as well.  I mean, I don't think anybody will wait for it.  Nobody cares.  It's with the pants.  No, they'll wait for it.  You think?  Yes.  I want to hear it.  This is the type of stuff you hold back. 
[01:08:30]  You could play it now and play it again.  You want to sync it up, Danny?  I can't.  Does that start when this starts?  I think it's the second one.  I can't hear it.  I'm in the same boat as you.  I can't hear it.  No, I know.  Just start yours at the same time.  I think it's the full clip, though.  It'll be close enough.  It'll be close.  Just so we have a visual.  For us, not anybody else.  As I prowl the stage.  I just don't know if you have the full clip.  That's all.  Well, that's why I asked Jimmy.  Is that the same clip?  Yeah.  It is.  It is.  All right.  So just start at the same time. 
[01:09:00]  It'll be close enough.  Here's Jimmy from how long ago?  This was, I was doing comedy six months, and I had won one leg of a competition in New Jersey,  in Rascals South, and this was the Bud Light Comedy Competition in Rascals West Orange.  So you're just starting your comedy career, but what year?  1990.  So this is 20 years ago?  Dude, this is fucking, I want to say October of 1990.  My first time on stage was April 1st, and I was six months in to comedy.  I remember when I was doing it.  No kidding.  Holy shit.  I was doing Spuds Buckley when you were doing this. 
[01:09:30]  Yeah.  It's a bad, but I wish I had continued in this vein because I-  You look like Spuds Buckley.  I went into my high energy thing after this.  Like, I tried to be likable.  Like, this wasn't really, this was more aggressive.  Yeah.  But then people were like, you got to be likable.  And that's when I went on to that high energy thing, which is-  With the wacky voice?  Much more humiliating than this.  And you're putting on some type of-  Heavier accent.  Very heavy New York-ish Jersey accent.  It was just a performing thing.  I don't know why I did that.  I was trying to find myself. 
[01:10:00]  All right, here we go.  I should have looked in the douchebag emporium.  That's where I would have been.  Jim Norton from 20 years ago.  Oh, dude.  A little taste.  Why did they call that the hair club for men?  Every one of those fuckers is bald.  No clue whatsoever.  Mind if I talk about sex for a minute?  Yeah.  You mind?  You lying sex and shit, you won't want to hear about it.  But I'd like to talk-  For one thing, Bud Light is sponsoring this thing, as we all know.  They make you wear this shirt.  And I don't even drink.  Men in the audience, any men in this audience ever try to have sex when we're drunk? 
[01:10:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, it's like trying to stuff a marshmallow into a coin slot.  So fucking, you son of a bitch.  And as soon as you leave, forget it.  Hard enough to cut glass.  You cannot fucking win.  And this microphone is full.  There we go.  We got it.  Men in the audience, let's see how honest we are tonight.  That's the line I hate.  You know, he's getting laughs, though.  Six months into, he's getting laughs.  With Otto's line.  They're laughing at him. 
[01:11:00]  Hair club for men was Otto's.  I have to keep saying that.  I'm sorry, Otto.  Oh.  It's just weird.  Hair club for men.  Sounds like a completely different person, obviously.  Yeah.  It really does.  Like more of an ass.  That accent is the fucking worst.  Pat from Monaco is calling you Jimmy DiPaolo.  I didn't know who Nick DiPaolo was at that point.  Or did I?  No.  He was, Nick's a Boston guy.  Jimmy's rocketing dignity.  What are you talking about? 
[01:11:30]  We got it.  There we go.  Oh, this mic is.  There we are.  Phone is full.  There we go.  We got it.  Men in the audience, let's see how honest we are tonight.  How many men in this audience masturbate?  I love an honest group.  Come on, man.  You're going to tell me with a face like that you don't masturbate, sir?  There you go.  You got hands like the fucking werewolf.  I know you masturbate.  It's like you got Willie Nelson in a chokehold. 
[01:12:00]  I masturbated a lot growing up as a kid, man.  I got no shame in it.  Growing up, my sheets looked like cornflakes.  I'm serious, man.  My parents used to bend up my sheets at the end of the week and sell them as wicker furniture.  Can I pause that?  That's still two of the best lines I've ever written.  Yeah.  My sheets look like cornflakes and wicker furniture.  Yes.  I will take those to the grave with me.  Yeah, yeah.  That's a good line.  It certainly was.  And I'll tell you where that came from.  I used to jerk off and I would wipe my own cum off with my sheet, move it over a little and fall asleep. 
[01:12:30]  I would wipe cum off on the sheets.  I slept it.  Yeah.  Do you think mom knew?  Grandmama and I were changing the sheets one time.  She was helping me.  And literally, there was a giant stiff patch.  And my grandmother said to me, what happened here?  And I was like, I spilled Pepsi.  Pepsi.  Is that what you call it?  Yes.  She goes, it tastes like cum.  Yeah.  Wow.  So that's where that line came from.  Well, the line is good, but it's delivered like Ralph Macchio. 
[01:13:00]  Hey, go.  Hey.  It sounds like we're listening to a young comedian out there.  You know, it's hard.  Without the comedian part, a young horse's ass.  It's hard to connect this to you.  I know.  It doesn't sound like you.  Your voice is completely different.  I don't know when I blew it.  I have tape from 95.  I went through this really weird time where in 93, I was like that high energy, like where I should have had my throat cut. 
[01:13:30]  But then I started coming to New York.  And in 95, I just found a set where fucking Eddie Brill brings me on a camera.  He didn't know my name.  He's like, when I was on my way to Vail to do a comedy contest out there.  And I'm like, I still have a little bit of the high energy voice, but I'm starting to mellow.  It's like you could see it's a huge difference from 93.  Yeah.  It's kind of cool to see.  Like I wasn't as big a douchebag.  Thank God for stage time.  This is just very interesting.  Yeah, yeah.  There's a confidence in you six months in.  It was just pretend.  Really?  You're out of your head. 
[01:14:00]  I was terrified.  Really?  I used to pray for gigs to get canceled.  Really?  Oh, God.  Because your body language is definitely showing confidence.  Dude, I like myself more here than I did when I was doing the, how we doing?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You know, rubbing my head.  That's why I thought this would be really bad.  I like that.  Because we heard the high energy stuff that's really uncomfortable to listen to.  I just like the voice.  This isn't as uncomfortable.  No, it's not.  The voice is very strange.  The voice is really odd.  But this is just a guy six months in.  In MC Hammer pants.  Oh, they're terrible. 
[01:14:30]  Here we go.  Let's play more.  My parents used to bend up my sheets at the end of the week and sell them as wicker furniture.  But I got no shame.  Anybody, men, remember the first time they masturbated?  Not yet.  Come on, sir.  Do you remember the first time you masturbated?  Sure.  He's doing it right now.  I remember the first time I masturbated.  I didn't know how to do it.  I was a dumb kid growing up.  So I asked somebody.  I had no pride.  I said, how do you masturbate? 
[01:15:00]  He says, dummy.  It's like shaking a ketchup bottle.  I said, okay, I think I could do that.  So that night I was trying it and I was having a great time.  And my mother had to ruin it for me.  She screamed at me.  She said, what the hell are you doing to those French fries?  They kicked us out at a restaurant.  I mean, it was bad news, man.  Phone sex is a new thing.  I tried phone sex.  I didn't like that.  I almost got electrocuted.  Bad experience, man. 
[01:15:30]  It fell apart a little bit.  And you see where my hands are over my face?  That's how the, uh, hold on.  Just keep it right there.  That's how the tape ends.  Sam cut it just to be, you know, radio conscientious.  But it quick, because the next one was, I remember I masturbated and it was, I used to do a joke about jerk it off in church.  And whoever was taping it just had enough.  Hey, we needed that.  No, no.  That was, you can't hear it.  I thought that would be hilarious to just hear the tape end.  Um, in the middle of your set.  Wow.  They just like, they just like cut you off? 
[01:16:00]  Yeah.  I mean, I, I.  Well, because they knew they weren't using it because it was too dirty.  So dirty.  Bud Light can't have fucking masturbation jokes.  Yeah, why not?  Come on.  Bud Light?  Maybe Bud Light.  Oh, yeah.  Well.  Maybe for Bud Light, but not for Budweiser.  It was for Fox, I think, or something.  I would love to get the whole tape, but I think that that literally is all that exists.  It's, wow.  Yes.  The voice is beyond recognition.  It's, it's not you.  I don't know when my voice changed. 
[01:16:30]  It changed at one point.  It might have been when I was doing 1999 when me and Louis Black did that fucking short film together.  I screamed through a lot of takes.  You had to scream.  Yeah.  Well, maybe it was just doing comedy every night.  Which film?  Side splitters.  I love side splitters.  Yeah, that was the funny one.  How long ago was that?  1999.  Get the fuck out of here.  If you've never checked out side splitters, I love that fucking thing.  Yeah, it's a 20-minute short.  Don't downplay it.  I think that was really good, man.  Really good.  We got, we got our pal DJ. 
[01:17:00]  He wants in bed about the athlete thing.  I am.  And the, and the kids.  DJ, what's up, brother?  Hey, good morning.  How are you, buddy?  Listen, oh boy.  I feel like Jimmy spilling Pepsi here talking to you guys.  When you're talking about this deal with black athletes and the multiple kids.  I know from Marty, I heard about his story.  It is crazy.  Nobody can get around it.  This guy is basically, what's up? 
[01:17:30]  Yeah, you're.  My problem is, why do you focus on the guy's face that's connected to the behavior?  Yeah.  Yeah, DJ, I don't know if we got you today, man.  Got some bad, uh, bad cell service.  Yeah, your phone's fucking up.  We can try again here.  Uh, DJ.  Hello?  Yeah, your phone's cutting out.  No joke, it really is.  Hello?  DJ.  Can you hear us?  Yeah. 
[01:18:00]  All right.  All right, we're going to try this again, because honestly, your phone was cutting out.  Okay, can you hear me now?  Yeah.  Okay, great.  Well, just to explain with the, uh, the black athletes, because, because I, just to help  this call along, it says, uh, singling out black athletes for having too many kids.  We went to a website where they're just listing, um, the guys that have the most kids out there.  And they all seem to be black.  So whether, maybe, I don't, I don't think this site, uh, is, is avoiding the white athlete  with, uh, with, uh, all those, with a lot of kids. 
[01:18:30]  Well, listen, my, my thing is this, there's a book you guys may want to get into.  I don't want to nerd you guys out.  But there's a book called, uh, uh, Black Rednecks, White Liberals by Thomas Sowell.  And it connects a lot of this behavior to the antebellum South, where actually so a lot of  whites that were conducting themselves pretty much in the same manner as the blacks you see  today.  It's not like an endivically black thing.  But no one, no one wants to talk about this.  I mean, you know, you have lower tier people of all ethnicities. 
[01:19:00]  It's not just black folks doing this.  But that's, that's my main issue is that if you keep on connecting it to a black thing,  you're not really being correct.  Why don't we talk about some of the lower tier, uh, Appalachian type guys that conduct themselves  the same way as this Cromartie guy.  It's called white trash.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But you know, but that, that community is not connected to you.  You don't think there's a, you don't think there's a disproportionate number though?  Oh, no.  I'm not a disproportionate number.  You know, all I'm saying is, is that, you know, you can't, you still can't connect the, 
[01:19:30]  the, the ethnicity to, uh, to, to the person as if this is the core thing with that.  Well, then how come you can't, hold on, how come you can't connect the ethnicity to the  person where if it was a positive thing, nobody would object to connecting the ethnicity  to the person?  Well, you know what?  That's an issue.  That's why you, you kind of have to fight back tribalism, whether it's negative or positive.  If you're going to be honest about it, you can't, you can't, uh, I mean, this is the 
[01:20:00]  reality of, again, if you do your research, you start seeing this stuff.  It's like, wait a minute.  This is not just clearly a quote unquote black thing.  You don't see it.  You don't see a problem in the black community with fathers fathering multiple children with  multiple mothers and, um, no father in the household, kids being raised by grandparents.  You don't think that is a problem, uh, a race based problem.  No, I don't think it's a race based problem.  How can it be a race based problem? 
[01:20:30]  No, I'm saying it is a problem, uh, but it's not necessarily a race based problem.  Really?  Mm-hmm.  Well, only because, again, that book that I mentioned talked about how this stuff was  very prevalent in other communities until, you know, until now you see it more and more  so in the black and brown communities, but it wasn't always that way.  I mean, the origins of this stuff, again, the origins of this stuff go back to, to England  where you saw some of these people that were, you know, lower class taking, taking, and this 
[01:21:00]  is, I mean, this is real, taking the gold out of the mouth of their, of their neighbor,  having multiple books.  So these athletes, but these athletes, you would consider them lower class?  They're, they're making millions of dollars.  Yeah, but the whole thing is that they're coming from the lower class.  You know, just because you have a lot of money doesn't mean it's your class.  So the lower class makes you stupid to the point where you don't realize that I shouldn't  be having this many children?  It makes you uneducated, definitely. 
[01:21:30]  The more, the more educated you are, the less of these things that you start to see.  I'm a high school dropout, and I know that.  A lot of these guys went to college.  If these athletes played college football, and college basketball, and college sports,  I'd drop that out of high school.  But that's you.  You're using yourself anecdotally.  I'm talking about generally.  There's a lot, there's a lot of stats.  Generally.  The higher, the higher educated you are.  Even if you were talking about color, if you were talking about blacks who are higher educated.  Okay, hold on.  Anthony's also a high school dropout. 
[01:22:00]  Yes, I'm an idiot.  Anthony's also, I'm just saying that it's part of it, but the education excuse.  Because we all know wearing a seatbelt is good.  You understand what I'm saying?  Like, you don't have to be a college Phi Beta Kappa fucking graduate to know that.  There are certain things you just know.  You know, if you fuck and you don't pull out, or you don't cover up, you're going to knock a chick up.  That's street knowledge.  Everybody knows that.  So that's not about education.  People know that.  Well, listen.  Education is definitely a factor. 
[01:22:30]  Education plus you get into the family structure, or the lack of a family structure.  You guys might have had a different family structure.  I mean, it might have been a culmination of things.  But the root, one of the roots of that behavior comes from an undereducated situation.  Okay, but Danny also, Danny, were your parents split?  Yeah.  Danny's a high school dropout whose parents split.  Anthony's a high school dropout whose parents split.  So I'm only saying that the examples in this room are not great.  Because Ope and I both had parents that stayed together. 
[01:23:00]  Between the four of us, we have one child in the room, and that was Ope in his 40s, and he wanted a kid.  Right.  And then, as I said before in previous calls, then you also combine that with a culture that kind of...  Well, that's what I'm saying.  Thank you.  But you're saying...  I said the culture.  You're saying get away from tribalism.  You're saying get away from tribalism, and then you're saying it's culture.  You can't have it both ways.  Well, I don't see how tribal and culture...  I mean, they are somewhat connected, somewhat separate.  You have different cultures or subcultures within a predominant culture. 
[01:23:30]  So you're...  But I said that there is a problem within the culture, within the black community, and you're saying it's culturally based, and I said I used the word racially based, but you're saying exactly what I was saying.  No, no.  What I am saying is I'm identifying a specific type of culture.  The lower tier culture I'm talking about is an aspect of black culture, or different types of culture. 
[01:24:00]  You have black Brits.  You have people from the West, people from the South, the North, gays, straights, conservatives.  You have all these different types of blacks, and yet you seem to be focusing on this lower tier as being the predominant culture.  I have nothing to do with this Cormarty person.  Perhaps we share the same pigment, but I'm different.  I'll give you an example.  Do you masturbate, sir?  It looks like you've got Willie Nelson in a chokehold over here. 
[01:24:30]  Listen, I'll give you an example.  Fucking Jimmy Norton in a Bronx tale.  I should have been in a car at the end of this.  If I may, I'll give you guys an example.  A colleague of mine asked me one time, oh, you know, you speak so well, you know, you're a great guy, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  I mean, all these accolades, you're talking media up for the club.  You're just a great person.  Then this person asked me, well, what about so-and-so with the next cubicle? 
[01:25:00]  How come she doesn't talk like you?  And my first reaction was to give her some nerdy answer.  And then I realized, wait a minute.  The simple answer is, my name is so-and-so.  My name is BJ.  This other person has a different name.  We're different people.  I have nothing to do with this person.  You're right, but you are correct.  That's an idiot thing for her to say.  But you can't act like you don't understand why people make those connections when a lot of times those connections are fostered and made by the people complaining, hey, don't connect me to that. 
[01:25:30]  Yeah.  Like, you know what I mean?  Like, it's a black thing.  Can be used.  Hold on.  That can be used for things that white people supposedly and at times accurately don't understand.  Okay, fine.  But when we say, well, how come, you know, it seems like a lot of black athletes are having 50 kids out of wedlock.  You can't go, that's not a black.  You understand what I mean?  You can't look at people like they're nuts for connecting that to black culture when other things are connected to black culture that black people have no problem with.  But the issue is, is it the totality of black culture or is it an aspect of it?  An aspect of it, I'm sure. 
[01:26:00]  In my opinion, some whites have been able to compartmentalize appellation culture away from everybody else.  If we focused on Appalachians and what they're doing, Mountain Dew Mouth, for instance, where these people are so, you heard about this wacky story where they're so ignorant that they're drinking Mountain Dew to the, you know, to having your teeth falling out of their mouth.  Mountain Dew Mouth.  This is a thing going on in Appalachia.  Yeah, yeah, white trash.  We understand that there's white trash. 
[01:26:30]  But you keep them in a corner.  They don't define you.  I don't want to be connected to Shea Kwan from Brooklyn.  I didn't say all black people are like this.  There are responsible black families that understand that they can only afford to have one or two children.  But I'm just saying, and I've said it before, disproportionate number.  And it amounts to a problem.  There is a genuine problem in the black community with single mothers, absentee fathers, and grandparents raising children. 
[01:27:00]  It doesn't define the black community, but it's a problem within it.  And you're saying that it's some of the higher profile black people.  It's, you know, maybe there are high profile white trash, but most of them are not the high profile athletes, I don't think, that are doing it.  You can't say, I don't want to be connected to that, when a lot of the people doing it are very high profile black citizens. 
[01:27:30]  Yeah, they're high profile, but it doesn't take away from their core caste or their core class.  I mean, because Mike Tyson at one time was worth half a million dollars, I mean half a billion dollars.  Does that mean that he's still not from East New York or whatever?  No, but don't, no, DJ, but I'm saying, don't be shocked when people connect it, when the higher profile black citizens are doing it.  Don't act like, how could anybody connect it?  You're comparing white trash and appellations. 
[01:28:00]  They're not as big a part of visible white culture as these athletes are of black culture.  Well, there's a reason for that, though.  I mean, that's what I'm trying to combat, is that if we started seeing more of all these different types of people,  then maybe you wouldn't be able to connect the dots that way.  Because in your culture, you're not doing that.  But why would we see more appellations?  No, what I'm saying is you specifically, you do not go to the lowest common denominator to define you.  You don't have an encircling culture that is being promoted this way. 
[01:28:30]  I can go to books, I can go to music, all this stuff is being promoted, whereas appellation culture is not being promoted that way.  It's a nail on the coffin right now, and I have to stop.  25.  Well, I don't even think we have to go that long.  20 seconds.  Well, your point is taken, but I don't quite agree with it, sir.  15 seconds.  Well, again, go to the book.  10 seconds. 
[01:29:00]  Black, rednecks, white, white liberals, and you might think differently.  I'll wait for the movie.  Sorry, Kathy Bates.  All right, two, one.  Thank you, DJ.  Sorry I took that call.  All right, why don't we break, and then we're going to get into the R word with Jennifer Aniston.  R words.  Also, we got Paul Mooney coming in today.  Oh, that's right.  Mooney's in there.  Paul Mooney.  9.30.  9.30.  9.30.  8.30 for Paul Mooney.  8.30, right?  8.30.  And then our old friend, TJ Miller, we haven't had him in in a while, and Get Me to the Greek. 
[01:29:30]  He had a great scene in Get Me to the Greek, and he's starting to fucking get some shit done  in Hollywood.  Yeah.  So we want to check in with him and see what he's up to.  He was the camera-holding guy in Cloverfield.  Yeah, you can blame him for the shaky cam.  The shaky cam, yeah.  The upset stomach you might have had.  The dizzy feeling.  The seasickness.  Woozy.  Woozy, right.  Troy Kwan.  Hit it.  Sirius XM.  It's a virus. 
[01:30:00]  Yeah.  This is the Obedien 3 Show.  Do you see us don't get a cloud and blue?  Do you see us don't get a cloud and blue?  Do you see us don't get a cloud and blue?  Do you see us don't get a cloud and blue?  Do you see us don't get a cloud and blue?  Do you see us don't get a cloud and blue?  Do you see us don't get a cloud and blue?  Do you see us don't get a cloud and blue?  Do you see us don't get a cloud and blue?  Do you see us don't get a cloud and blue?  Do you see us don't get a cloud and blue?  Do you see us don't get a cloud and blue?  Do you see us don't get a cloud and blue? 
[01:30:30]  Do you see us don't get a cloud and blue?  Do you see us don't get a cloud and blue?  Silver, excuse me, Silver Sun pickups.  Oh, yes.  I was wondering.  Off their CD, Swoon.  Ooh.  What else is going on in the world today?  Oh, we got Jennifer Aniston.  I guess we could move into that.  She's in a little bit of trouble for using the R word on Regis and Kelly.  So you can't say retard. 
[01:31:00]  Shh.  It's the R word.  Be sensitive.  Oh, come on.  The whole blank word thing is just getting out of control.  Yeah, yeah.  Stupid.  And you were saying on the way in that they were doing this story and they said,  well, Jennifer Aniston used the R word.  The R word.  And then they played the clip of her saying retard.  So why is that okay for the news to do?  Wouldn't that hurt the retards out there? 
[01:31:30]  Yeah, because, again, they played it.  So if somebody didn't hear it at first, they heard it that time and might have been offended.  Wouldn't that bother the moms and dads out there?  You know what I mean?  It's not the retarded people.  Why is it okay, though, to blast Jennifer Aniston for saying the R word,  but then you play the clip on your news program?  Yeah.  And why is that okay?  Wouldn't that be hurtful as well?  It's the same sound.  Exactly. 
[01:32:00]  Invokes the same unpleasant to look at image.  But that shit drives me nuts.  Like me and Ant were talking before the show, the Janet Jackson thing.  Yeah.  You know, where everyone was outraged, but the news is playing the clip over and over again.  So wouldn't that be, you know, hurting children or whatever the fuck it was supposed to do?  I don't even know what that was supposed to do.  We're a country of tattletales.  That's what we do.  It's a chance to tattle on somebody.  Country of faggots.  Why wasn't it okay?  It wasn't okay to do that at the halftime show, obviously, okay?  But it was okay for the news to play it over and over again. 
[01:32:30]  What's the difference?  I don't get it.  More people saw it on the replay than saw it originally.  You think so?  Oh, absolutely.  They're still going by the rules of Cronkite where the news gets more leeway because it's news,  so they have more content.  But the news basically saying this hurt people.  Like the Imus thing, nappy-headed hoe, that hurt people, okay?  And then the news played the clip over and over and over again, and it exposed nappy-headed hoe to so many more people.  Yeah.  How many people actually heard Imus say it that day? 
[01:33:00]  No one.  No one that would have been a quote-unquote offended.  They just – it's gotcha.  That's what the whole –  But the news –  The first faggots at Media Matters is.  It's what the news is.  It's gotcha.  But the news in the end offended way more people.  Of course.  Way more people by replaying nappy-headed hoe.  To the people that would be offended by language, by the way.  The people that make their advertising dollars showing you murder and car accidents and nothing but horrific things that really don't connect to our lives.  I'd say 70% of the news doesn't affect you. 
[01:33:30]  It is just morbid voyeurism.  That's how they get their advertising dollars, and that's acceptable.  But if you say contour or a retard, you're a terrible person.  Yep.  Right.  Well, now we've got the Dr. Lore.  So now they're replaying that clip over and over again.  Of course.  Over and over.  People.  Right?  Yeah.  So offending more people, but it's okay because it's the news.  The news should be allowed to offend people, I guess.  Yeah.  Not the R word.  So this is the latest.  Jennifer Aniston using the retard word on Regis and Kelly. 
[01:34:00]  What's the difference between saying retard word and the R word?  It's the same fucking thing.  It really is.  I know.  Well, people know what it means, so.  Basically, you just did it.  That's one of her classic poses, and that is Jennifer Aniston.  And with all these fun wigs, and it was, and you know, that funny girl.  And so it was just like, it was just fun.  You played dress up.  I played dress up.  I do it for a living like a retard, but, you know.  They all laughed.  She was making fun of herself. 
[01:34:30]  They all laughed.  Like a retard.  Self-deprecating.  It's like when we were growing up, calling each other fag.  We didn't mean, you know, that your buddy sucked fucking dick.  You just said, don't be a faggot.  Right.  And that's how she was using it.  Like a retard, I fucking do this at home.  Why does nobody just hit back, though?  See, the problem is, they allow themselves to just be fucking beaten by these groups  instead of just going, shut the fuck up.  Shut up.  Because you know why?  Because she just offended her entire fucking film base.  Those are the ones that laugh at her movies.  They're retards. 
[01:35:00]  Oh, another wacky comedy.  Retards.  Awkward, but pretty girl.  Oh, look, she falls down and falls.  Yeah, she's got another bad movie coming out.  Of course she does.  The Switch.  They just keep giving her movies, though.  It's amazing.  Because she's pretty hot.  If she was an ugly actress, she would have been long gone.  Gone.  It's another thing that happens in Hollywood.  The pretty people get to stay.  What happened to the other girls from Friends?  They're all doing pretty good.  Are they?  You got the one doing the Cougar show.  All right. 
[01:35:30]  Okay.  She's doing the Cougar show.  Oh, yeah.  And then everyone else is pretty much doing nothing.  Yeah.  Lisa Kudrow was doing okay.  She had a show on, I think.  Great show on HBO.  On HBO.  It was only one season, but that was a good show to come back.  Yeah, that was good.  She's really awkward.  She's very funny, man.  Lisa Kudrow.  But she's not doing anything.  So, this is just retarded.  What's going on here?  Retarded.  Now the news will just play this clip over and over again, offending more people that would  be offended by that.  I don't know why retarded is so bad. 
[01:36:00]  Like, it definitely means, you know, slowed down.  Yes.  And mentally, you're just slowed down.  You're mentally retarded.  Well, the invader invokes.  How about when they're screaming in the mall holding balloons?  That invokes an image, too.  Fucking mental health advocates are so irritating.  Why?  They're just trying.  They're obsessed with the language.  It's like, shut your fucking faces.  It's just language.  I mean, come on.  God.  I told Anne that, you know, you should be able to say whatever you want, but saying retards 
[01:36:30]  are a little rougher than the other letter words.  Is it really?  I don't know why, but it just seems to be.  Maybe because they can't fight back.  Because, like, if you use any of those other words, you certainly, there's a consequence.  You know what I mean?  But I don't think anyone says, hey, retard.  I don't think anyone goes, hey, retard.  Right.  Like, it's always used as, that was retarded, or don't be retarded, or, you know, you're  never saying it to a retarded person, or a mentally challenged person. 
[01:37:00]  Simple jack.  No.  Simple jack.  A person with mental disabilities is person-first language now.  A person with, we know it's a person.  Yeah.  We know.  Not an ostrich.  I like Anne's thought on that, because you're right.  I've never walked up to a retarded person and said, wow.  Well, hey, retard, or stop being a retard.  Never.  He wouldn't care anyway.  Get out of the way, retard.  He's eating paint.  But certainly to your friends or something, if they did something, whatever, you would. 
[01:37:30]  Yeah, you go, you're, don't be retarded.  Right.  You're being retarded.  But then again.  I'm a retard.  Yeah, things like that.  I've said the N-word to N's.  I mean, it's just dumb to say it like that.  All right, Larry King.  N-person.  N-person.  N-person.  But again, that's another thing.  I've obviously used the N-word as it's correctly called.  As a verb.  Have you ever said it to an N-person? 
[01:38:00]  That's just it.  No.  It's usually to, you know, your friends or something like that.  It's followed by the word rich.  You're being rich.  Get up, you.  You know, things like that.  Which I don't think that's that bad.  Just like the word retarded.  Hey, you're a retard.  Or midget.  Are they actually saying the M-word for midget now? 
[01:38:30]  With lowercase M.  Oh, yes.  It's a little tiny M.  I like it.  Don't boo yourself.  No, no.  I kind of like that.  Little people.  You were ready to boo yourself.  No, no, I don't mind.  I think that was kind of clever.  Yeah, or when you say you've rigged something in a certain way.  Right.  Jury rigged it.  That's another one.  I just think the media in general is just so stupid because they've really taken on this  whole N-word, R-word, M-word, F-word, and I just feel like that just gives the words 
[01:39:00]  way more power.  With the letter?  Because it also allows a lot more people to say the word without saying the word.  Because you know what it is.  Right.  It conjures it up in your head the second they say N-word.  You know exactly what they're saying, and you picture the anchorman actually saying  the word.  Right.  Do you know, and it's funny, I just watched an interview with myself and a friend of  mine, Jessica Delfino, naked in New York.  I think we had just gotten thrown off the air.  Some local.  Which time?  Yeah, 02.  Oh, okay.  Eight years ago.  You've got to explain that.  And I forget how the language came up, but Jessica was just talking, she was a new comedian 
[01:39:30]  at that time, just talking about how the N-word, like when you say it, that's what people think.  And I didn't realize that we were talking about that eight fucking years ago, and they're  still doing it.  Wow.  Well, now they're doing it way more.  You never heard the news say that.  But when you look at how out of touch...  And it kind of bounced around it.  Sometimes you had to kind of realize what word they were talking about.  But now it's like, no, we're allowed to say the N-word on TV.  When was that used like?  When did that really start being used?  Was there an episode?  Did something happen?  Imus. 
[01:40:00]  No, way before then.  Where the news started saying N-word and all that?  Imus.  Well, because he didn't, but he didn't say that.  I know, but it brought up, it just brought the discussion.  Michael Richards pushed it farther because he actually said...  Oh, I think it might be Michael Richards.  Yeah, you're absolutely right.  But Michael Richards definitely pushed it forward because they wanted to talk about what he  did that day, and they certainly weren't going to say it themselves, so they started  saying N-word.  Right, exactly.  Yeah.  And then it became okay for the news to just go in that direction. 
[01:40:30]  Yep.  Look how out of touch there, like Larry King, when you listen to somebody in that position,  that's how he says, an N-person.  That's a guy who has a lot of black friends and is comfortable around black people.  Yeah, yeah.  An N-person.  That's Larry King naked.  What a dope.  An N-person.  If you put the word in there, it comes off as very funny sounding.  An N-person.  Oh, God. 
[01:41:00]  One count, obstruction of Congress.  Three counts, making false statements.  And two counts of perjury.  Those are the charges that could be levied against Mr. Clemens.  He's in deep trouble.  He's in Dutch.  What?  He really is.  Well, you know what?  Let's go to Nicole in Pennsylvania.  Nicole.  Who is this bitch?  Good morning, boys.  Hey.  Hello.  Hello.  Yeah.  Nicole.  Hi.  Hi.  I just wanted to comment on Jennifer Aniston saying, retard. 
[01:41:30]  My brother is retarded.  And that is the medical terminology for it.  It doesn't offend me.  It doesn't offend my family.  And I think the news just blows it completely out of proportion.  Mm-hmm.  Well, I agree with you on that.  I'm sure there's parents out there that are offended by the word.  I mean.  Oh, yeah?  Just to throw the other side of the argument in.  Yeah, of course.  They want to be called mentally challenged.  But then that becomes a bad thing to say.  You know what I mean?  It changes. 
[01:42:00]  Because then we push away from saying retarded.  Then we say mentally challenged.  And then that'll be offensive for a lot of people.  Yeah, when you start calling your friends.  You know, ah, don't be mentally challenged.  What's the difference?  You're mentally challenged.  Huh?  I think mentally challenged sounds worse.  Worse?  Worse.  Aren't we all mentally challenged about something?  Every day you're mentally challenged.  Every person is.  Just a meaningless term.  But then that'll become the offensive term. 
[01:42:30]  Absolutely.  That's how this works.  That's why it doesn't make sense at all.  You're not helping the cause at all.  Michael Richards is so angry.  You're welcome.  God was Michael Richards.  He just had it.  So angry.  Yeah, he didn't want to be heckled.  Oh, did he not want to be heckled yet?  Well, because I think he realized he wasn't being funny on that stage and someone called  him on it and he just didn't want to hear that.  The black guy was like, you didn't know movies.  You got Seinfeld.  That's it. 
[01:43:00]  The guy said to him?  Yeah.  They were throwing some barbs at him.  Yeah, but what he did.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It was just over.  I'm not even trying to.  The top.  As a comic, I can tell you, he just didn't know how to handle being heckled that badly.  He's not a good enough comedian to handle it.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Look.  Look at what it is.  Oh, God.  That's unbelievable.  He lost his fucking mind.  It's just unbelievable.  That's great.  Let's say hi to Bill in Colorado. 
[01:43:30]  Bill.  Hi, guys.  Hello, Bill.  I think I speak for the rest of the audience that having a hot chick with a smelly snatch  say the word retard does not offend us.  Ah, right.  Jennifer Aniston with her stink box.  Especially how she used the word.  Yeah.  Lighten up.  She said it on herself.  She said, I would never fuck her.  Jesus.  Yeah, I mean, Obama got called out for using that word also. 
[01:44:00]  He had called out for saying that when he bowls, it was like the Special Olympics.  Right, right.  Did he say retarded?  I don't think he said retarded.  No, I know he did it in that clip.  He said, I'd bowl like the Special Olympics or something like that.  He said, Pelosi's a retard.  I don't know what he's saying that was.  Let's go to Vinny.  Called out for accuracy.  Whitehall, it looks like.  Vinny?  Good morning, boys.  Hello.  My kid's autistic.  She has Asperger's.  She paints?  If you call her retarded in front of my wife, it is the scariest thing in the world. 
[01:44:30]  Oh, yeah?  The lights in the room dim.  Okay.  And it gets, a chill passes through the room.  And she'll be like, my daughter is not retarded.  You know, you get that clip speech as she's trying to.  My room is.  Using, yeah, I'm perfectly fine.  Thank you.  Vinny, all right.  All right, listen, I get that.  All right, so I wish I could talk to your wife.  So if people go and use the R word, would she be okay with that? 
[01:45:00]  When they just say, you know, your daughter is the R word.  Interruption, interruption, interruption.  Sorry.  The whole deal is, if we use the term as an insult, don't be a retarded.  Don't be such a retard.  That's cool.  She just doesn't want, she and the parents of the other autistic kids that we hang out  with, they don't want, they don't want the level 10 word used on their level 2 kid. 
[01:45:30]  All right, I got you.  So if someone now says your daughter's mentally challenged, is your wife okay with that?  Because that's the word, that's what they want used.  That's about a level, that's about a level 8 word.  So mentally challenged would still bother your wife, obviously.  That's the point I'm making.  Well, it's like saying that a person who's got a broken leg has got no leg.  Like, the term for the stuff that, the term for the kids that are at my daughter's level 
[01:46:00]  is she has special needs.  See, again, it's the why is that okay?  Right.  Because it's one of those deals, it's one of those deals where you don't want to be,  you don't want to be accused of being worse than you are.  Let me ask you this though, why does she get mad?  I can see if someone said, hey, your kid's a retard to get very angry, but if someone asks  and they're not being dicks, why get angry at them when it's like the layman wouldn't  know unless they ask? 
[01:46:30]  It's like you're kind of training people not to ask and not to be open to just think it.  She's not, she's, well, she's, she's very good at, she's very good at making her, she's  very good at making her point when she's angry, as, as, as a lot of wives are.  Yeah.  She, when you're done, you know what she meant.  Um, but she, it's, it's, it's just one of the, it's just one of these deals where  it's hard to, it's like I said, it's hard to, it's hard to, it's hard to get right.  You don't want to use a word, you don't want to use a term that's far more serious. 
[01:47:00]  Yeah, but no, who knows?  You know, no one knows.  They're all, everybody's supposed to know what level, uh, of, of mental handicap a kid  has, or.  Oh, no, but, but again, in her case, she doesn't go out and sue people.  She just, explains, no, she's not retarded.  And how retarded is your kid?  Asperger's and all this.  Her, she's not bad, she's on the honor roll.  She's, we wanted to get a bumper sticker for our car.  My kid has Asperger's and is on the honor roll. 
[01:47:30]  What's your kid's excuse?  But you see what I'm saying?  It's like, okay, she has special needs, but every kid has fucking, we just, the language  is driving me nuts.  And, and, and your kid has Asperger's?  Asperger's, which is strange.  That's all.  Oh, yeah.  I mean, they're full, they, they fully function.  And they're, they're very bright, bright kids, right?  Oh, yeah.  She's doing, yeah.  I mean, she's doing very well, but again, when we were growing up.  She just can't keep her clothes on.  When we were, yeah, when we were growing up, they were the weird kid in the room, you know? 
[01:48:00]  Yeah, they weren't diagnosed.  You just knew they were a little different.  Yeah, I mean, back when I was a kid, we were convinced that they actually, it was a rationing  program.  They had to put one retarded kid in each class.  Asperger's.  So that you know, so that you knew who you were.  I'm starving.  We got any Asperger's back there?  Yeah.  Yeah, we're looking at Asperger's right now.  If you put Asperger's in the Google search, you get some fun pictures.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  You get some of those ghetto booties with burgers in the middle. 
[01:48:30]  Asperger's.  Get it?  I'm happy to say my daughter.  Their ass cheeks are the buns.  Right.  I'm happy to say my daughter isn't suffering from that, and I thank God every day for it.  Yeah, to call someone with Asperger's retarded, that's a little weird.  As long as you're not mean about it, if you don't know any better and you're asking, there's  no reason to get angry, because people don't know.  It's like you want people to be open-minded.  Don't train them that if they say it wrong, they're going to get scolded.  But again, if it's your kid, it's probably harder to do that.  None of the kids, I mean, we have a whole group. 
[01:49:00]  We have a whole group that we hang out with.  We're vicious.  We're constantly making jokes about how the Autism Day Parade, the Autism Awareness Day  Parade, everybody walking down the street constantly being distracted by things in the windows, covering  their ears when the band starts to fly.  See, it's like the black thing.  See, they can make fun of each other.  They can make fun of Asperger's.  Because they got kids with Asperger's, but if you, Anthony, that doesn't have an Asperger 
[01:49:30]  kid, you can't.  No.  I don't get that either.  I've never gotten that.  No.  You've got to have a sense of humor about it when you've got it.  All right.  So then why, you're showing you have a sense of humor.  So why, if, why can't you hear it from an outsider if they're just trying to have fun  with the whole thing, too?  He don't care.  His wife does.  Well, no, they're not.  Believe me.  If you, if we're good, we're smart enough to know, and most people are smart enough to  know.  I'm not a fan of, we could say it, but you can't. 
[01:50:00]  I've never been a fan of that.  Obviously, we've talked about it many times, there's a consequence if you go down that  road, and you should understand there, you should understand there's a consequence.  But this, we could do it, but you can't mentality is, is, I don't get that, and I never will,  man.  Never will.  The problem is, is that there are way too many people in this country who cannot grasp  contact.  They will, they either can't, or won't.  All right, Vinny, thanks, man. 
[01:50:30]  I'm bored.  All right, you retard.  I'm bored.  Here's the thing.  I get tired of this argument.  Well, you know, your brother can say something about you that other people can't.  Well, then here's your options, sensitive fuck with parameters.  Either get mad at your brother for saying it, or allow everyone to say it.  But I don't care about, my brother can say about me whatever.  Fuck you, and fuck your brother.  I'm not going to take the hit because you can, your brother can say it and I can't.  Fucking asshole argument that is.  Right, you might have to fight, but you should be able to fucking say the same shit. 
[01:51:00]  A fight, a fight, yeah, you know.  Oh, that's true.  Yeah, the end where it started with the OJ case.  You think it was that?  I think it was the OJ.  What was the famous clip from that?  From the cop there.  Furman.  Yeah, from Mark Furman.  We might have to go back to the OJ.  Yep, because they...  I think that started the whole thing.  Michael Richard certainly pushed it way forward.  No, OJ, you're right.  I don't remember during the OJ trial hearing the news anchors saying N-word, F-word, G-word.  I think it was Mark Furman who said the N-word.  Right, it definitely...  Yeah. 
[01:51:30]  Yeah, okay.  But I think it was pushed forward with Michael Richard's word.  Now the news is all about using letters.  But you would just hear them say like, and they used a racial epithet.  Oh, there you go.  That was what they used to say.  You're right.  Racial epithet.  But now they say the N-word.  Did Walter Cronkite say that?  A racial epithet.  The N-word.  That's when the news was the news.  Walter Cronkite.  A bunch of Ns. 
[01:52:00]  They didn't harp on every misstep verbally that every public figure has.  Because he was too busy saying, it appears that Vietnam is now unwinnable.  That's what he was reporting.  As opposed to, so-and-so, the star of that show on the WB, said titties in an interview.  I'll just go with Snooki.  It's all about Snooki now being a pest.  Every misstep.  Snooki has been arrested in New Jersey.  Could you see Walter Cronkite talking about Snooki? 
[01:52:30]  Never.  And her elephant ass.  Edward R. Murrow.  Yuck.  Talking about Snooki.  I am so fucking sick of Snooki.  I'm not.  If she bent down in front of you, would you have to?  I wouldn't even look.  I always say I would for the story, but I think I finally found one where I don't know if I could do it for the story.  I saw that elephant ass on What Would Tyler Durden Do?  Whoa.  It's an EA, Opie. 
[01:53:00]  Have some sensitivity.  It's not an elephant ass.  Snooki looks like that woman from Goodfellas.  When they're all giving each other the facial treatments.  Oh, very good, yes.  And that one old one with the little chiclet teeth and stuff.  She looks just like her.  Let's all be honest, man.  Some girls don't have the greatest ass, but when they bend all the way over,  it makes it way better.  But in Snooki's case, I don't think the bend over is going to help that ass.  It's like my mother used to say, an ass doesn't matter, it's all in the cunt. 
[01:53:30]  She would say that a lot.  Anyone who would listen.  Loudly.  Wow.  In the library.  Yeah.  I bet you she was the talk of the town.  Oh, they were all like, there's you-know-who talking about you-know-what again.  Asses don't matter, it's all in the cunt.  We got it.  Heard you.  Let's say hi to Matt in New York.  Matt.  That's what I'm about to use to say.  Mattie.  Don't listen to yourself on the goddamn radio.  Don't you hate that?  That just shows we have new listeners, I think. 
[01:54:00]  Because I think the old guys know by now.  Yeah.  I'm thinking.  I think they're retarded.  You like to think that, anyway.  Chris in Rochester.  Why did I go to Chris in Rochester?  Chris, what do you got?  Yeah, there's a video of Larry King on YouTube interviewing Roger Ebert right after Gene Siskel  passed away.  And he's trying to get the question out of how he died, and it's, I won't try to do it,  but it's hilarious.  All right, we might have to find that.  Well, what, what, what, the, yeah.  Sir, what happens in it?  If you can give us a summary.  Yeah.  He, like, stumbles over his words for about five seconds. 
[01:54:30]  Is he trying to find the right word, or he knows what he wants to say, he just can't  get it out?  He's, like, he's, like, doing, like, uh, I don't want to do it, but he's, like, who  is it?  How did, how did he die?  Except, let's say hi to Jerry in Chicago.  Jerry.  I guess you know how he feels, don't you?  What's up, buddy?  Hey, happy birthday, Jimmy.  Hey.  Go.  Hey, uh, do my new test.  Hey.  Be a little more original.  All right.  What?  And, uh, I get a little annoyed when people say retard. 
[01:55:00]  Why, buddy?  We didn't hear you.  I'm sorry.  I get a little annoyed when people direct retard towards little kids.  Yeah, I mean, it's a little meaner when it's a little kid and you're being insulting.  Sure.  Yeah.  And that's where, that's where the whole consequence thing comes in.  I, I, I could, I, I would understand if you had a retarded kid, you don't want to  hear people call me a kid retarded.  Of course.  But if you're saying it, like, let me ask you something.  Do you have a retarded kid?  Do I?  No.  Because if you have a retarded child and someone is saying, like, you know, if your 
[01:55:30]  son is mentally retarded, there's a big difference between saying, yeah, I think your son's mentally  retarded than to say, hey, your kid's a retard.  Right.  Like, there's a total difference in intent.  Yeah.  I hope people understand.  We get that.  Yeah.  But when you're growing up and you're just fucking around with your friends and you, and you say  stupid shit, like, don't be a retard.  Don't come in my mouth.  Retard.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Well, that's the whole thing.  I, I only get annoyed when I hear it, but it annoys me because I deal with it.  But actually anybody who gets offended by it's a fucking fool.  But that's the problem. 
[01:56:00]  They're trying to like, take that.  I mean, yeah, and the noise, I kind of like, I do a little, like, you know, one step, but  to tell you the truth, what the hell does it matter?  Everybody's called each other a retard when they were growing up.  Right.  It's not that big of a deal.  Right.  I'm saying nagger.  Right.  Just giving the words power, my brother.  All right, man.  All right.  The fuck you want from us?  Jesus.  Andy in Cleveland.  Andy.  Hey, guys.  I used to substitute teach, and I'll tell you, around about school. 
[01:56:30]  No, you didn't.  Yes, it did.  I don't know.  It didn't come for an argument.  Prove it.  Anyway, around about 14, 8th grade, is when these kids, like, start using this shit like  a playing card.  They kind of get what's going on, and that there's a system in store for them to help  them along.  So they start using it to get out of stuff that they don't want to do.  And I witnessed this amazing meltdown from an old school gym teacher I was co-teaching 
[01:57:00]  with.  And this kid was like, I can't do that.  That's not my IPA.  I'm ADHD.  What's IPA, sir?  It's like their lesson plan that they lay out.  Like, just, they get a specialized lesson plan.  What's it stand for?  India Pale Ale?  It's like Individual Progress Assessment, I think.  And so that they, um, yeah, India Pale Ale.  Yeah.  Forgetting it.  IP Lick, please.  Well, anyway, the gym teacher, the gym teacher just, uh, like, just had it with this kid 
[01:57:30]  and in front of the entire fucking class, just like, I am so goddamn tired of you fucking  alphabet kids telling me what I can do and not do it my goddamn job.  And I, I, I, I had to be, like, calm, but I'm like, oh my god, alphabet kids.  I was just like, that is gotta be more horrific than retard any day of the week.  Alphabet kids.  That's pretty good.  I'm gonna use that one. 
[01:58:00]  And I had, and I had to go from, like, I had to go from, like, three hearings with this  guy, uh, just to, just to speak in his behalf, uh, cause they were, they were getting ready  to fire him.  And he was, like, a long-term teacher.  And we, I had to sit through, like, some, right?  You should have hang-up on callers that, um, go to, to, to, to long a day.  Make a move.  I think it's just, I think it's just hang-up on callers that go to long a day.  I have.  That's all.  I have really bad ADD today.  Really?  Yeah.  You're alphabet kid?  I don't even know what that guy said.  You missed nothing, cause I do. 
[01:58:30]  No, he ate one thing.  I don't feel like, I don't feel like focusing today.  As a gym teacher.  What did he say?  You know what I was thinking about during that whole fucking call?  What?  We should, we should, we should play.  What, what are you thinking about right now?  Fucking Troy Kwan gave me 10 Pearl Jam shows.  And I was, I was so happy yesterday.  I drove, I drove my girl nuts because she's like, look, look, I, I, I get it.  You like Pearl Jam?  Cause we had to do a lot of driving.  She goes, but it sounds like one long fucking song, but I was really digging it. 
[01:59:00]  Cause when you're driving and you can put a Pearl Jam show on, it makes the time go by.  The whole show.  And I was listening to a Pearl Jam show.  I'm just, I'm going in my head right now.  And it was from Soldiers Field, 1995.  And I was loving it.  So you were just thinking about that?  Yes.  Like I was rambling on.  I was just thinking about how much I was digging, listening to this Pearl Jam concert in the car last night.  That's what was going on.  I completely missed that guy's phone call.  Just phased him right out.  And I have a smile inside my soul.  Cause I got like 10 more Pearl Jam shows to go through. 
[01:59:30]  I've rediscovered Pearl Jam.  I fucking, I'm loving it.  Well, you're a little, um, they did let my love open the door.  That old Pete Townsend song.  They did, uh, uh, a couple other, uh, covers.  Well, you had a much better conversation in your head with yourself than we had with that gentleman.  What are you thinking about right now?  Um, that has nothing to do with the radio show.  Uh, I really, I was, I don't even know.  Not necessarily during that call, but what are you kind of thinking about as this radio show goes on? 
[02:00:00]  All I'm thinking about is Pearl Jam.  And I thought a little Silver Sun pickups too.  When, when we played that song coming back.  Oh, I was thinking about the fact that I got to pick up my car.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Why?  Well, my, my car is done in Rhode Island.  Oh, are you going there this weekend?  Yeah.  So I was like mulling over when I should go and.  How are you getting there?  Not having it.  Choo-choo.  Oh, you got a choo-choo and then drive it back?  Choo-choo and then drive it back.  Don't do it, James Dean.  I'm going back.  Every PBA card and get out of jail free. 
[02:00:30]  No kidding.  Everything.  No, I'll try to be a good boy with it.  Mm-hmm.  But, uh, that's good.  Homeless Jim says, Ant is thinking about 1030.  You know what I was thinking about?  Are you?  Making this company a better place.  Giving them 110% of radio and making this company a better place.  Have fun.  Is it good for the company?  Drop me an email.  Let me know how it goes.  That's what I was thinking.  Yuck.  Yuckaroo.  How do I help the company? 
[02:01:00]  Uh, this guy sounds retarded.  He might be retarded.  John, are you retarded?  Eric, in the office.  You're on.  Hi, guys.  Can you hear me?  Yeah.  Are you faking retardation?  Ramon!  Of course you are.  Fuck your cousin.  Right.  I didn't even hear the Ramon line.  What?  What was the Ramon line?  Something about fucking your cousin.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Hey, this guy's got a great idea.  Really?  Is he going to shoot himself instead of talking? 
[02:01:30]  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Wait till you hear this guy's idea.  I'm telling you, someone should have came up with this weeks ago, Chris.  You're brilliant.  I say they should go ahead and build that mosque right downtown at Ground Zero.  Then go ahead and let them build a pig slaughtering factory right next door and a strip joint on the other side.  God damn, your fucking phone petered out.  Yeah, get a better phone, dude.  Repeat that, but slowly. 
[02:02:00]  I got an iPhone and I'm in the middle of nowhere.  Can you hear me now?  Kind of, yeah.  What'd you say?  Yeah, what's up?  I said they should go ahead and build that mosque.  We heard you!  Nice!  And build the towers to look like the middle finger.  A-giggy.  A-giggy.  She built four of them.  Yeah!  And one tall one like the middle finger. 
[02:02:30]  Fuck you!  Got it.  You're not a fan of that?  No!  I don't want the fuck you built at the end of Manhattan.  You're not a fan of the, you know what they should do.  You know what they should do.  We all go through business and commerce.  We all go through life with that guy.  You know what they should do.  You know what they should do.  Yeah.  Take them.  People that say they should rebuild the towers, fine.  But they should rebuild four in the middle words.  Fuck you!  There's the picture.  Yeah.  That's great.  That would look nice and low on Manhattan. 
[02:03:00]  Not really.  Yeah, that would be very dignified.  The president of the United States.  And finally, the fuck you tower is built.  Nine years later, we've told the world, fuck you.  Boy, is this not satisfying.  Now we just have a giant middle finger, which is technically also pointing north at Connecticut.  So we're saying fuck you to New Jersey, the Statue of Liberty, Connecticut, Queens, and the water.  And everyone that flies in who's here for legitimate business.  But we're also saying it to Al-Qaeda. 
[02:03:30]  Right.  You know how you say fuck you?  Stop giving out visas.  We don't have to make a big deal about it.  Every local gin mill has the, you know what they should do, guys.  You know what they should do?  They should take the guy and use a rusty fucking tuna can lid and cut his balls off.  You know what they should do to Osama bin Laden if they find him?  They find him?  Here's what they should do.  Make him go into a tower and then fly a plane into it so he burns up. 
[02:04:00]  Why aren't you a fan of that, Jimmy?  How can you be?  Because that guy had a good one, though.  No, he didn't.  Strip club and a pork slaughterhouse.  A pork slaughterhouse.  That'd be good.  It's pure idiocy.  It's pure idiocy.  The reason why the great Gutfeld one worked, he's really trying to do it with the gay  club thing.  And he was making a legitimate statement as opposed to, I mean, it was a shocking thing  as well, but he at least surrounded it with what was very smart about tolerance and bridge 
[02:04:30]  building and trying to get Islam to think a different way.  And, you know.  You know what they should do.  What did you say, Jimmy?  About tolerance.  ADD.  I'm not even joking.  You know what I was just doing there?  I was just singing an elderly woman behind the counter in a small town to myself.  I hate that song, though.  I've seen to recognize your fear.  The best part, though, Soldier's Field, when he said, I just want to scream hello. 
[02:05:00]  Guess what?  The whole crowd.  Hello!  Hello!  You get the whole crowd saying hello at the same time.  It's a wonderful concert moment, Ant.  One of the great concert moments you can live through.  Yeah?  Yeah.  And Eddie says, I just want to scream hello, and everyone just screams it.  I like how I brought that up like six months ago, and you all laughed at me.  Ooh.  Well, what part?  We're still laughing.  That part.  I mentioned how they did that.  I'm actually goofing on it, but I actually really like that a lot. 
[02:05:30]  That's called, too.  I like the Rocky Horror Show at a concert.  And he said a toast, and they all threw toast at him.  Yes.  But we did mention I'm not a fan of the sing-along thing, because I didn't, you know, I paid  to be there.  So you fucking perform, and I fucking watch.  I know.  I don't want to see.  I'll sing along with you, but don't fucking put the mic in the crowd and make us do your  work.  I don't want to see that.  I paid to see this thing.  What is he doing?  What is Seinfeld doing? 
[02:06:00]  I don't get this one.  Danny popped up a picture of Jerry right in the middle of going, hello!  Oh, okay.  You know, I don't think I've ever seen that episode.  That's hysterical.  La, la, la.  I'm catching up on my Seinfeld, finally, now that they've been off the air, what, 10  years?  Fucking great.  Finally catching up.  Although, less channel show in the Seinfeld.  Yeah, yeah.  They're all about Family Guy now, man.  Family Guy is on every other channel.  Yeah.  Around the clock, too, man.  You fucking do guide on your cable system.  You see Family Guy all the way across. 
[02:06:30]  It's encouraging.  What is it, TBS or one channel is basically playing at 24 hours a day?  You got Family Guy on TBS, on, I think, our local CW here in New York.  I got at least two, maybe three channels.  Cartoon Network, Fox, yeah.  Okay, so there is three channels playing the Family Guy.  Yeah, yeah.  And you know what?  I fucking stop every goddamn time with that Family Guy.  It's pretty goddamn funny.  That Seth MacFarlane doing the roast for Hasselhoff, he did a good job hosting that.  Yeah, he certainly did.  Like, I didn't think he had that in him. 
[02:07:00]  I love the guy, but he's such a fucking bore when we get him on our show.  I don't know why.  You know, I guess with writers and stuff, he was really good on the roast.  Yeah, he's a funny guy.  I thought he was a good host.  I mean, he does have the voices for Family Guy, too.  But his real voice kind of sounds like, what's his name, the dog?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, it's his real voice.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Brian, yeah.  Brian, the dog.  Hello.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  Yeah, he wasn't very good on the radio.  Just tired of everyone that comes on the radio doing nothing for the radio back. 
[02:07:30]  Mm-hmm.  Just almost none of them do.  What do you mean?  Just thinking about that interview that they, when McHale's publicist wouldn't give us a  few minutes with just him, they'd fuck everybody.  Yeah, I know.  Fuck everybody.  Thank God we're so fucking talented.  If we depended on everyone else, we'd be fucked.  Oh, we certainly would.  So sick of fucking everybody.  There's a bunch of magic.  You know what they should do?  That's my new favorite bit. 
[02:08:00]  All I want to hear is you know what they should do.  You know what they should do?  It's the you know what they should do.  Awkwardly, you have to listen to the guy.  And you're like, oh, no.  Not that you know what they should do.  Because the problem is, none of this shit will ever be done.  No.  It's always some asshole who's had too many drinks.  You know what you should do?  Get in the car and hit a fucking pole with no belt on.  That's what you should do.  You know what they should do to that guy?  Yeah.  They ought to let the family. 
[02:08:30]  Yeah, that'll happen.  That's very realistic.  That's how the justice system works.  That's one of them.  Yeah, yeah.  That's one of them.  Thank you, Joe.  That's dope.  What they should do is let the family.  Put them in a room for 10 minutes with the family.  Yeah.  That'll work.  I can see the judge okaying that and the lawyers fighting it out.  He's trying to get the family to beat the suspect with a bat.  Well, I'm going to allow that.  That motion passes.  Because this is America.  Yeah.  You know, that's...  Oh, that's another one.  I forgot about that one.  You know what they should do, guy. 
[02:09:00]  You should let the family members...  Oh, I love you know what they should do, guy.  Yeah.  He's always a fool.  You never hear this.  You know what they should do?  Let them go on trial and face due process.  You never hear that.  We got to play you know what they should do on Twitter today.  I'll start it off.  You know what they should do, guy.  Yeah.  I love you know what they should do.  Because it is usually something for a rapist, a child molester that they... 
[02:09:30]  They should let him get raped.  That's an excellent idea.  It's very feasible.  They should take his cock, right?  And take rusty scissors.  All right.  And make him run with them and get in trouble.  Doug, you know what they ought to do.  Boom.  Throw the rapist in the bag.  Does Bobby know what they should do, guy?  You think Bobby's a you know what they should do, guy?  I know he is.  He really is, he?  Yeah.  That's what they ought to do, even when he tries to be logical and not crazy. 
[02:10:00]  All right.  Game on.  We're playing you know what they should do on Twitter today.  Use that hashtag so others can see your fucking witty answer to the you know what they should do.  They're looking for raccoons.  Oh, boy.  You know what they should do?  They cut the raccoon's balls off and let the other raccoons see them.  You know what they should do?  Here's one.  Now they're coming in on NC Feedback.  Now we can play on the radio.  You know, you can play on Twitter as well, but it's more important to do it on the radio. 
[02:10:30]  John S. writes, you know what they should do?  Turn the Middle East into a big parking lot.  I actually agree with that one.  I know, but it's not.  It's just ridiculous.  Nuke it.  Right.  Nuke it.  Yeah, that's a good idea.  It's the whole Middle East.  Just nuke it.  Turn it into fucking glass.  Yeah, because I could see that happening in the war room.  Listen, we've had problems.  All right, we have a motion here to drop nuclear weapons on the entire region. 
[02:11:00]  You know, I'm for it.  Let's do it.  Yeah, you know what they should do.  Yeah.  Congress has said it's okay.  You know what a pain in the ass, though?  Let's break it down.  So a lot of you have heard, you know what they should do?  They should turn the whole fucking thing into a parking lot.  Yeah.  You know how much of a pain in the ass that would be for the soldiers working with fucking  tar in that area?  And where are you going to go after you park there?  You know how hot that asphalt's going to be?  Exactly.  Who wants a 6,000 square mile parking lot?  Why would they put our soldiers through that? 
[02:11:30]  What's near there?  Make them work with hot tar.  I know.  They just need a tram to take you wherever you're going.  Imagine parking in the middle.  Oh.  Yeah.  The sun beating down.  You have to walk for days to get to the target.  On hot pavement.  There's no reason for that.  Imagine legally that's the only place you're allowed to park for now, aren't you?  I'm parking.  There'd be probably about 8 million unused spaces.  People like this lot stinks.  You know what they should do? 
[02:12:00]  Turn it into a parking lot where the parking spaces are painted like on a bike.  Tires.  And there's the blocks so you can't go through.  I've heard this one, John, in Tucson.  You know what they should do?  I can't do that voice too much longer.  They should let them build a mosque and we should fly a plane into it.  Yeah.  You know what they should do?  They should take a beer and go down the sly.  Oh.  She did that. 
[02:12:30]  She did.  It's nothing funnier than calling a gay man.  She.  Oh, they hate it too.  Look, ma'am, I apologize.  Hey, sister, listen to me.  Someone wants to send us gulf shrimp.  What are you, fucking insane?  Yeah.  Story came out today.  There's a 21-mile oil slick or something or what.  I want to explain why BP is falling.  You know what they should do?  You know what I actually...  Make the BP execs go out there and clean it up themselves.  Yeah, with toothbrushes. 
[02:13:00]  That's another one.  You're right.  Study shows there's a 22-mile-long invisible mist of oil below the surfaces of the gulf.  And I couldn't get to the caller the other day.  A guy actually said, because we were talking about we're scared of the shrimp and everything  else that comes from the gulf.  And they're like, the fucking fish are way down below.  You got to pull the fucking shit through the oil.  They don't have like a bank system tubing thing where the fish gets sucked up from the  bottom, you cunts.  Right.  But someone actually said that, and I forgot. 
[02:13:30]  We just couldn't get to him in time.  The fish are down low.  He was all pissed off because he's like, look, you know, you got to pull him through the  oil.  The oil.  Oh, oil.  Oh, yeah.  Here's a huge one.  Jim in L.A.  Yeah.  You know what they should do?  They should all go back to Africa.  Or a variation.  We should, you know, ship them back to Africa.  That's from Tony in Nassau County. 
[02:14:00]  Can you imagine if you attempted that?  Yeah.  But I'm a, what do you mean?  I have a job.  I'm a corporate lawyer.  Yeah, come on.  On that boat.  Get on the gangway.  What?  What do you mean?  Come on.  It's going back to Africa.  And then, like, where in Africa would it go?  And how would the people survive?  Is it a civilized part?  Or, like, you know, Somalia?  They should go back. 
[02:14:30]  There's so many of those.  God, I've been in so many fucking situations.  We've got to listen to that drivel.  You know what they should do.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, why is BP fucking crashing?  I don't know.  That pisses me off.  It's, like, almost down by where I bought it.  Should have sold at 41.  Me too!  Idiot.  You guys want an N-word joke from Stu in Westchester?  Yeah, Stu. 
[02:15:00]  What?  Stu, what are you doing?  What are you doing, Stu?  Good evening.  What are you doing?  How's it going, fellas?  Good evening.  What are you doing?  Why didn't the shark keep the end person?  You can just say it.  I don't know why.  He thought it was whale shit.  Come on.  That's kind of decent.  Oh, my God. 
[02:15:30]  It's not even funny.  How about a shitty DVD for that one?  Yeah, we should do this, guys.  It's not even funny.  It's kind of fun.  I'm going to laugh all day at that.  Travis, please.  I beg you.  Just fucking get us out of this way.  Is Paul Mooney here?  Paul Mooney.  No Paul Mooney?  Not yet.  If he's late, tell him to go home.  Tell him to go home. 
[02:16:00]  You'll never guess.  He's running late.  No, you know what?  Then he doesn't get on the radio today.  Fuck him.  That's too goddamn funny, man.  I seem to recognize your face.  That's a dumb fucking joke.  Are you still there?  I'm still here.  Got another one?  Yeah.  Any more?  No, that's it, man.  One and done.  Go out on top. 
[02:16:30]  All right.  Thank you, sir.  All right.  We're going to break and do something.  Yeah.  I'm going to tingle.  Yeah, I got it.  I got it first.  Daddy got it, too.  All right.  All right, man.  Hi, who's this?  My name is William, and I like to wear dresses.  R.  Yeah.  E.  Goodness gracious.  T.  Yeah.  A.  R.  D.  T. 
[02:17:00]  Retard.  Retard.  Yeah.  Woo.  B.  Retarded.  B.  B.  Retarded.  B.  Retarded.  B.  B.  Retarded.  Stomp your hands and clap your feet.  Retardation can't be big.  You know.  You know.  You know we retarded.  T.  A.  R.  E.  T.  A.  R.  E.  Retard.  Retard.  Yeah.  Woo.  My name is William, and I like to wear dresses.  The virus.  Sirius XM. 
[02:17:30]  This is the O.P.  Anthony Show.  Good white boy music.  What is this?  Pearl Jam.  Animal.  Pearl Jam.  Paul Mooney in studio.  Pearl Jam.  Playing Caroline's what, Paul, tonight?  Starting tonight?  Yeah.  Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.  You know Thursday has passed, sir.  Well, you said tonight.  That's Friday. 
[02:18:00]  Yeah.  Just want to make sure you...  Well, the only reason I said that, Mr. Mooney, I was trying to help you out, because the  plug sheet says you're playing Caroline Saturday and Sunday.  Well, they lied.  Exactly.  That's why I said, are you playing there tonight?  Like Congress.  Right.  They lied.  Yes.  You don't like Congress?  What does your hat say?  I only got, say no to the...  N-word.  Say no to the N-word.  N-person.  Nice.  That's what we're talking about today.  I'm sure that's what we're talking about every day.  Say no to the N-word.  I mean, doesn't it depend on what he's asking for? 
[02:18:30]  You should...  Oh, I think I'm misreading that.  You're basically...  Wow.  You're basically saying that people should just say the word, right?  No.  Yeah, of course you're talking about it.  I mean, everybody's talking about...  No, but I'm saying you should just...  With Dr. Cuckoo Bird.  Who?  Dr. Laura?  Too funny.  What's your take on that?  Well, actually, when I first heard it, I thought, there's no problem.  I said, isn't she with Dr. Dre?  Isn't she a rapper?  I said, isn't she part of his posse? 
[02:19:00]  It's okay for her to say it.  And then I found out that it was seriously a doctor.  Yeah.  You think she was just looking for a reason to say it?  It sounded to me like she was looking for an excuse to say something, and that was what  she thought was her excuse to go off on the tangent she wanted to go off on.  She's a victim of her environment.  Hmm?  Hmm?  Yeah.  Everyone's always trying to find a place to put something, you know?  The Italians do that with Sicily, you know?  Yeah.  It was Sicily.  The Moors.  The Moors screwed everybody. 
[02:19:30]  Mm-hmm.  But they're trying to put it in one place to keep it...  Oh!  I love this guy!  ...to keep it in one place.  So it's to put it on her.  It's her.  No, it's not her.  It's coming down from the top.  She's...  I mean, she's just, you know, she's...  Welcome to America.  Yeah.  I mean, she's responding to the place she lives in.  White people do love that word, though.  Listen, when I came in, my first instinct, when I saw him, I said, I know I'm right.  He's cleaned up his whole act, his whole look.  He's really gotten his white man look together. 
[02:20:00]  Nice.  You know, they know it's the end.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It's the fall of the Roman Empire.  Nice.  So he's going to go out looking good.  We really are finished as a group, white people.  We're done.  But it's fun.  I mean, but...  You know, but it's interesting that it comes...  It's on the table.  And I just...  I love that it's on the table.  It cracks me up.  I mean, when I hear these things, I said, oh, here we go again.  And, you know, and before, like, when you...  When I first came on here, you picked up on my humor. 
[02:20:30]  Of course.  Before, you didn't know it.  You were terrified, but it's okay.  We were a little confused by you at first, Mr. Mooney.  Yeah, but it's okay.  But it's...  We understand each other now, though.  Yeah, but they think it's me.  And I said, if I drop dead, it has nothing to do with me.  Don't they try to lynch me for this whole thing?  See what I got here?  I mean, leave it alone.  But it's always going to rear its ugly head because America has these racial problems.  But we're working on it.  Oh, yeah.  We're working on it.  Do you think we're really working on it?  I think so.  With the doctor and this one and that one. 
[02:21:00]  We'll work it out.  Yeah.  I'm telling you, black criminals and white criminals are becoming...  That's, to me, what says that we really are living together better.  Because recently, we've had the black woman drowning her kids, a black guy throwing semen.  Those are white people crimes.  Don't forget, it's like, wait, the black guy shooting up the...  Shooting up a...  That's a white guy crime.  That never happened.  That is a white crime.  Well, the only good thing about that is the three black people that he worked with, now  they can come to work late and they can do whatever they want.  That's the only good thing about that. 
[02:21:30]  We needed some logic.  That's funny.  That's the only good thing about that.  Yeah, who the fuck is going to say anything?  The Jew that went crazy and was killing black men.  You know about that?  No.  Oh, see?  I don't know.  Here we go.  Rich Vance?  No, no, no.  They found him trying to go to Tel Aviv or trying to go to Israel.  He was walking around going from state to state, stabbing young black men and beating  him in the head with a hammer, and he killed five, and I think maybe 20 got away or something. 
[02:22:00]  I didn't know that that was a cross-racial crime.  But the press never mentioned it.  Never mentioned there was black guys.  No, they never mentioned that he was doing it.  Yeah, we know the story.  That he was doing it.  They never said it because they liked it.  Wow.  All men keep doing it.  Did you know that, Jimmy?  I did not know that.  That was the latest serial killer, right?  And they just called him.  Oh, yeah.  They were calling him a serial killer.  Yeah.  There's not many Jewish serial killers.  It's a hate crime.  Most of them.  Yeah, I'd have to say that's a...  I didn't know he was going after black men.  No clue.  Usually serial killers stay in their own group.  That's part of the serial killer. 
[02:22:30]  They usually don't...  Very few have actually crossed...  Doesn't fit the profile.  Yeah, very few cross races.  Well, welcome to America.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  It's very hard to profile a Jewish serial killer killing black men.  Yeah.  I bet the CSI people had no clue.  Well, I'll tell you what.  I don't know what prison they're going to send him to.  He's dead.  Shit, he's dead.  Oh, yeah.  Two things are going to happen to him in prison because there's a lot of black men in prison.  They're going to screw him and then they're going to kill him.  You had a very funny joke years ago about Jeffrey Dahmer being killed because it was all black guys in jail. 
[02:23:00]  And you're like, he ate the neighborhood.  You can't eat the neighborhood.  And then run off to jail.  They got relatives.  Isn't that the man that ate your brother?  Yes, I'm going to kill him.  I'm amazed he lasted as long as he did in jail.  Dahmer.  Oh, yeah.  Well, he knew, too.  He knew.  I mean, he liked to eat black men so much, he moved to the projects just in case he got the munchies.  A little late night snack.  Yeah, a little late night snack.  You know what?  That serial killer really is screwed because how many Jewish gangs are there to run to to protect you in prison? 
[02:23:30]  None.  You know, you could go to the white supremacists if you're white.  You could go to the Hispanic groups.  Yeah, but don't be fooled by them.  There is a Jewish mafia.  Oh, yeah?  Oh, yeah.  Seriously.  And they'll find you in an alley dead with a bagel up your behind.  Don't make no mistake about it.  I bet they're all in the white-collar prisons, though.  Probably.  Like, Bernie Madoff.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I don't see them being in the, you know, D-block. 
[02:24:00]  No.  You know, because the black gangs will want to kill them and the Aryans will be like, well, we'll hold them down if you want.  Yeah, exactly.  It would be nice to see the black guys and the Aryans working together.  Fighting it out over who gets to cut his Jewish throat.  You ever heard about that?  You ever heard about that young black guy, the one that was doing drugs on the outside?  And the gang thing and all the gang.  They're going to make a movie of it.  I've got to think of his name and what's stated was him.  And he was different from the rest of them because, you know, the rest of them with the pants off, they show, they let you know, you know, bringing all the attention. 
[02:24:30]  I'm with the drugs and the bling, bling, and the, the, the, the, the, the, the.  Right, right.  And he'd walk around with a suit and tie and the whole thing, all right?  And so they couldn't get him and they busted him on something stupid and they put him in prison and he got the, what you just named, the white, the white, the, all, he got all of them together.  Wow.  He got them all to be together.  He said, let's stop fighting ourselves to, you know, spite our face, our nose to spite our face.  Let's control this.  Now they're controlling the drug traffic from inside the jail. 
[02:25:00]  The Aryans are?  All together.  They got together.  They all got the, he got them all together.  That's so nice.  They all got them together.  Now they're controlling everything from inside the prison.  And splitting the money instead of fighting it out.  Yes.  That is beautiful.  Yeah.  Sort of like this room.  It is.  It really is like this room.  Except we control fat girls and guys with mullets.  Kind of like this room.  Yeah.  They got it from listening to your show.  I sure hope our audience would go see Paul Mooney.  Yeah.  Funny motherfucker.  Yeah.  Hell yeah. 
[02:25:30]  At Caroline's this weekend.  Yeah.  Get the plug in.  You guys got new stuff too.  But isn't your audience American?  Uh, yeah.  Yeah.  Most Americans.  Some Canadians.  The bad.  The bad.  Excuse me.  All the bad parts of America.  Yeah.  American.  American.  American.  American light.  Those are Canadians.  I want to stop in and see Paul this weekend.  I'm in town.  Why are people so impressed with Australians and Canadians?  What is the deal?  Just being different.  Somebody a little different than the asshole you deal with on a daily basis.  It's kind of nice. 
[02:26:00]  It's, you know, oh, you're from a faraway land.  Maybe things are different.  Maybe you're a, no, you're an asshole.  All right.  It's the accent.  People like the accent.  It makes them sound smarter.  Like they have a different view.  Canadians sound smarter.  No, no, no.  I'm thinking about more British.  It's like when a British guy says something like, oh, that's interesting.  When he's just as dumb as anybody you grew up with.  Yeah, somehow with that accent.  It's like the opposite of the southern accent where no matter what you say, you sound stupid.  Did you see Zsa Zsa coming out of the hospital?  No.  Oh, where is that?  Oh, no.  In Beverly Hills. 
[02:26:30]  No, I know.  Where's the video?  Did you see the bumper sticker?  My other car's a hearse.  Jesus, she's finished.  No, no, no.  She went home to die.  Francesca was with her.  You know, we know Francesca.  Who's Francesca?  You know the daughter, don't you?  No.  Hilton?  Oh, my God.  What's right?  You're not from.  That's right.  Well, here.  Well, the daughter was with her.  There she is.  That's Zsa Zsa?  Oh, my God, yes.  That's why I said that you see her.  Oh, my God, man.  What the?  Wow.  Is the darling gone?  Zsa Zsa, darling.  Oh, that's it.  93.  But there's a video of her leaving the hospital?  Yeah, with her daughter.  Can we find that, Danny?  How old is her daughter? 
[02:27:00]  80.  Well, she's got to be in her fucking 50s, right?  No, but she's a real Hilton.  She looks like the daddy with the wig on.  Oh, yeah?  But slow.  Oh, I forgot.  She gave birth to Hilton's, right?  Yeah.  Zsa Zsa did?  He denied Francesca because Zsa Zsa was pregnant with Francesca at the time she married that actor.  But she met him on an elevator and said, you're going to be my next husband.  And she ran off with him.  So he was pissed off.  So, but I told Zsa Zsa, I mean, I told Francesca, I said, look, they're paying, the Hiltons are paying her off to keep her mouth shut. 
[02:27:30]  I said, that's not money.  You're the heir to all of it.  Dig your daddy up and DNA him and get your money.  Yeah, that's all it takes, right?  Because blood is thick of the water.  Damn.  I said, dude, I've been pushing her.  I mean, I think she's scared.  I've been on her.  You know what I'm saying?  Wait, you know what I'm saying?  I should marry her and then walk in the Hilton.  Donor's here.  Give my wife her goddamn money.  I mean, I'd be all over the news, huh?  That would make the news, I think. 
[02:28:00]  Why is she afraid to do it?  Is she afraid that it's going to come up not?  You think she's afraid that he's not the father?  Listen, you have relatives.  You know how it is when you're in a family.  And no, she's not afraid.  She looks just like this man.  I mean, they're dead ringers.  No, it's a family.  Family controls and dominates.  But she's getting money.  Yeah, but stay quiet.  So she's scared that if she fucks up, then the money she is getting goes away.  Well, stop.  That's what the whole, but hey, but hey, she should go for it.  Yeah.  So why would you stay at Motel 6 and your last name is Hilton?  You think the Hiltons stay at Hilton's? 
[02:28:30]  Hell no.  I'm just saying.  You know, I mean, it's dumb.  They don't stay at the Hiltons.  You know, Paris doesn't.  I forget where she stays when she's out.  Right.  I'm sure it's...  We can't find the video, Mr. Moon.  Four seasons.  It's all right, but it's okay.  But I mean, it's just...  I would love to see that.  I mean, the end is the end.  It's the end.  It's the end.  Man, she looks like shit.  She does not look good.  She looks good.  Now that you know...  They're trying to...  And they can't do it.  They're trying to find somebody to play Elizabeth Taylor.  They can forget it.  You don't want to find anybody that pretty.  There's nobody that pretty.  Really?  I mean, in her prime.  I'm not talking about now. 
[02:29:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  She slipped on a banana, but not...  You think she was that pretty?  She fell into a buffet.  You haven't seen the pictures in her prime?  Let me see her old pictures.  Amazing eyes.  Amazing eyes.  That?  Come on.  That's better than that.  The eyebrows were pretty fucking hot right there.  Come on.  Since she was 12.  That's a hot picture.  Come on, since she was 12.  Come on.  I like the older...  In National Velvet.  Look at this woman.  You can't argue that one.  You can't argue that picture.  Come on.  Look at this woman.  Yeah, you can't argue that one.  Who are they going to get to play her?  Punch her up in National Velvet. 
[02:29:30]  You know what?  How about Scarlett Johansson if her hair was darker?  Huh?  Scarlett Johansson's face has at least some resemblance.  A little.  But come on.  There you go.  These faces are fake.  Big lips.  Look.  Come on.  Look at this face.  Yeah, she's pretty.  She was 12.  They were out there since she was 12.  That puppy's dead.  Yeah, it sure is.  She's holding two puppies.  They're both dead dogs.  Then what is her name?  Dead dogs.  The one that played Salt.  Angelina Jolie.  Well, she's going to play Salt and Pepper.  Now, they picked her to play Cleopatra.  Jesus.  Oh, really? 
[02:30:00]  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah.  This is the third white woman they picked to play Cleopatra.  The first was Claudette Colette.  Elizabeth Taylor.  Now, this one.  What's wrong with that?  Black woman.  She was because Cleopatra was black.  Cleopatra was black.  I didn't know that.  I didn't read that in my history book.  Her daddy was.  Well, they wouldn't tell you that.  She's a white boy.  Her daddy.  I said that.  Her daddy was Nubian.  Her daddy was Nubian.  Well, they actually.  They evened the score, though.  I mean, look.  We had a black Ed Norton and a black Ralph Kander.  And I think that wipes the slate.  That hurt us as badly, believe me.  That wipes the slate clean.  We're even, Paul.  We were very hurt.  We were very hurt by that. 
[02:30:30]  Yeah, but I'm saying.  Not to mention Black Doctor Do Little.  No, and she wasn't half Greek.  She was married to Greek for power.  And she killed him.  She never even slept with him.  But I got one better than that.  Okay.  Who's this white woman?  They say the greatest actress ever to walk on a stage.  American stage.  You know her.  Meryl Streep?  See?  He's smart.  What?  I'm saying they say that she's the greatest actress.  Yeah.  The greatest white woman actress in America.  I thought you were going to old school.  Guess who she's getting ready to play?  Harriet Tubman.  What? 
[02:31:00]  Get out of here.  Harriet.  Okay.  There is no way.  That can't be true.  No way.  Paul Booney has lost his mind.  I didn't mean no way.  Because they would never catch a white woman.  Okay, listen to me.  We're going to look it up.  All right.  We saw, I saw an old bonanza.  And a horse ordered a mail-on-a-bride.  Chinese.  Guess who the bride was when she got there?  An American actress.  Yeah, yeah.  Marlo Thomas.  I can't make it up.  Now, you think I'm making up some stuff? 
[02:31:30]  She's going to play Harriet Tubman.  What do they do?  Do a little make-up to the side to make him look like planet eyes?  I cannot wait for the reviews.  She was absolutely brilliant.  The make-up was phenomenal.  If this is true, Danny will find it.  And so far, he has not found it.  There has to be a black actress that could pull that off.  Halle Berry or something.  Meryl Streep.  Meryl Streep.  Meryl Streep.  She's perfect.  She's perfect.  I'll put it in my beard.  I want to play George Washington.  I do love watching the old movies where all the Asians are, like, obviously not Asian. 
[02:32:00]  They do something with their eyes.  Oh, they just put mascara.  Yeah, they put, like, eyeliner.  I'm trying to think of an actual movie.  They put eyeliner on Marlo Thomas' eyes to make them look Asian.  But did you notice the white man with you?  Look it up.  Look it up.  This can't be true.  Look it up.  That can't be true.  This can't be true.  Not Meryl Streep.  What's the one with the big lips that was in that movie I hated, The Blind Side?  Sandra Bullock.  Sandra Bullock.  You didn't like that movie?  Well, I thought it was a Stevie Wonder story. 
[02:32:30]  It pissed me off.  But anyway, yeah, I like her now because she hid her black baby.  Governor Patterson.  Yeah.  Any time a white woman can hide a black baby, I like her.  Yeah.  Guess who she's getting ready to play?  Oh, Mooney?  No, the black woman that invented the hot comb.  And her black baby's going to co-star.  That sounds like a great movie.  Here's the comb, Mama.  Sounds like a fantastic movie.  But do you know, she hid that black baby from her husband.  But that woman is, I like that white woman. 
[02:33:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Can you imagine her hiding a black baby in a white environment?  Yeah.  Sandra, what are you doing with that extra piece of chicken?  Nothing.  Nothing.  She was hiding the baby from Jesse James.  Yeah.  Everybody.  It wasn't too hard to hide.  He was fucking everything that walked.  That's true.  She'd be out doing a movie.  He'd encourage her.  Go ahead.  It's a good role for you.  Leave.  That was an easy hide.  Oh, just plowing that fucking Michelle McGee pussy. 
[02:33:30]  Yeah, he was never home.  Yeah.  Love him.  Let's keep going with this.  Isn't he supposed to be a Nazi?  Nah, he's just, you know, one of those guys that dresses up.  He did some wacky stuff with some Nazi things.  It was Halloween or something.  Who doesn't?  Yeah, come on, Paul.  Who doesn't throw a Nazi uniform on every so often?  You can have an open mind sometimes, Paul.  If you can't just goose step around your house a little while.  Yeah.  You'll have to be close-minded about everything.  He's like, look at the picture.  Have an open mind.  Yeah, have an open mind.  So he put a little Nazi things on the synagogue. 
[02:34:00]  Yeah.  Exactly.  He was drunk.  He was drunk.  It's about communication.  He was drunk.  Who doesn't have a few wacky pictures of people wearing Nazi regalia?  Yeah, that was a bad one.  That was just, not even the outfit, just the hat and the salute.  Just the hat and the salute.  Yeah, you got to watch how you put your arm up like that when you're wearing a Nazi hat.  Well, I did put a little Luftwaffe cap on my nephew, and he looked adorable.  Why would you do that to a kid? 
[02:34:30]  Because he had a little Luftwaffe hat on.  It was great.  Wouldn't he look cute in a Dodgers hat, too?  Yeah, exactly.  Nice hat.  A Yankees hat.  It's not as fun.  Who did they arrest for lying?  They got somebody else.  Roger Clemens.  He didn't get arrested, though, but he's being charged.  I thought they said they were going to arrest him.  That's the big story.  He's been charged.  Yeah, he's being indicted, right?  All right, I'm sorry.  Who's indicted him?  Who's arrested him?  Congress or whoever indicts.  They're big liars.  A liar knows a liar.  They tell a lot.  The pot is calling the kettle names.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  They're big liars.  Yeah.  He'll fit in great with them. 
[02:35:00]  But they got him for perjury and lying to Congress.  And they say that his trainer, I mean, isn't the trainer's word against him?  Yeah, but he's suing the trainer.  It's a whole mess.  He sued the trainer.  It was dismissed.  And now-  Isn't he suing him again?  The trainer's suing him.  Oh, the trainer's suing him.  Oh, the trainer's suing him.  Okay.  Because of legal fees and both mutual defamation suits.  And if Clemens comes out and admits that he lied-  The trainer is a hater.  Yeah, he's a snitch.  Oh, come on.  He's an asshole.  Come on, total.  He made a lot of money doing this shit.  First of all, steroids is new for us. 
[02:35:30]  It's not new for them.  Babe Ruth was on steroids.  Let's keep it real.  He was doing something.  He only shot him into his stomach, though.  What a fucking fatso.  Because look, you know those Nazis-  Sprinkled it on chicken.  Those Nazis were experimenting on everything.  This is not new.  I mean, the Jews that got away were on steroids.  Steroids.  Boy, they jumped the wall.  You never really saw that.  It was a race of super Jews.  You think this crap is new?  New to us. 
[02:36:00]  Super Jews.  Who's the guy with the muscles and the big J on his shirt?  Oh, my God.  That's hilarious.  Yeah, we think that they should all just go in the Hall of Fame.  Who cares?  They all knew that steroids were, you know, in the league.  There's no era where it was pure and everybody played the best talent man to man.  That's never existed.  A lot of guys in the Hall that never played against the black man.  Yeah, for years.  Pitchers didn't have to face black hitters.  Right.  And then some guys only played day games.  They didn't play night games. 
[02:36:30]  No matter what area you go to, there was problems.  They had something going on.  They were all trying to cheat.  It's all, what, relative to time?  It is relative.  But doesn't it kind of come with the territory?  What do you mean?  Yeah.  You know, it's like your job.  It's like what we do.  Liquor and drugs come with the territory.  It's like anything else, though.  Look at, like, auto racing.  Do you think those guys that were known to be fantastic auto racers back in the 40s 
[02:37:00]  would have been able to handle the cars that are doing 300 miles an hour today?  But they're in, like, racing halls of fame, known as the greatest race drivers of all time.  Meanwhile, they'd shit their pants going around, you know, the brickyard in an Indy car,  almost hitting 300 miles an hour.  Let's dig up some of those fuckers and see what they can do.  Pop them in a car.  It's safe to say.  But it's like anything else.  That's what I'm saying.  Any sport is always going to evolve.  You get better. 
[02:37:30]  And the greats from the past couldn't hold a candle to what people are doing now  just because of technology and working out and stuff has made people kind of better at what they're doing.  But he's right.  Every job has that.  It's like you can't say the comedians aren't great.  Prior Kinison weren't great because they were on drugs.  You can't say that.  It's, yeah, why does it matter if better athletes are on drugs?  It's what happens within the environment.  It's just, it's a part of the game.  It's like the jazz players were on heroin.  I mean, it was part of this game.  Come on.  It's that old gag, take the drugs away from the musicians. 
[02:38:00]  We'd have a lot of shitty music right now, right?  Yeah, yeah.  So why is it that okay but athletes on fucking steroids to make it more impressive?  Not.  And plus the fact there are hundreds of guys who are doing steroids.  Hundreds.  Yeah.  So they all should just be in the hall and let's just move on.  And why are them all, all of them are so upset about cheating?  So what?  So everybody cheated.  They cheated the Indians.  They cheated a bunch of people.  Why are these people all calling names like they're the...  Cleveland?  They're the...  Yeah.  No, everybody's trying to prove that they're perfect. 
[02:38:30]  What do you mean?  I'm a little confused.  No, that people, in other words, the haters are trying to pretend like they're these perfect  people.  They're these angels.  Right.  We don't do any of this.  We don't do anything.  We don't go to the bathroom.  We're not human at all.  So we're going to get at you because you did this.  So everybody has some form of cheating and that and baseball with steroids and yeah.  Oh, I knew I had something to tell you.  I saw him in Hollywood at a Starbucks, of course.  The dog whisperer.  Oh, Cesar Millan. 
[02:39:00]  The wife left him.  He's divorced.  Really?  He could train those bitches with four legs.  Not a great trainer after all, huh?  No, he met a real dog.  The two-legged one.  Oh, boy.  Wow.  That's good.  What did he catch it with?  A jar of peanut butter?  Pit bull smoking a cigarette.  Fucking cocky.  Oven mitts taped on his little paws. 
[02:39:30]  Oh, that's fucking horrible.  I called him about the guy they called in Jersey.  You know, the white man they called screwing that pit bull.  Oh, God.  What?  I kind of vaguely remember that.  The ballsiest animal fucker ever.  They're not even cute.  No.  A poodle is something.  If you fuck a dog that's sexual, you fuck a pit bull, that's a crime of anger.  You're trying to prove something.  But if you're able to get that done, you shouldn't be charged.  That pit bull had to be mixed with poodle or something.  Yeah, something. 
[02:40:00]  A pit bull won't let you pet him.  Come on.  I bet you'll keep it up on that one.  All right.  Puppies are very cute.  You should get a ticker tape parade if you get that done.  You can fuck a pit bull.  Yeah, you really should be.  Get the fuck out of here.  You should be heralded.  Absolutely.  That thing spins around.  You're in trouble.  Yeah.  You're going to fuck it well.  Guess where...  Is it Viagra?  Guess where it comes from.  Guess where they get it from.  I know.  The heart medicine.  No, no, no, no. 
[02:40:30]  Watermelon rhymes.  Look it up.  Watermelon rhymes?  Comes from watermelon rhymes.  So if you eat the watermelon, you think...  It comes from the rhyme.  So if you eat that shit, you think you'll get a bonus?  Well, look.  Black men's been eating it.  We've been eating it all this time.  Oh, see.  And you, Whitey, will make him fun of us.  We throw away the rhyme.  We don't...  You don't mind that stereotype, do you?  No.  Oh, you're going to go out and buy 10 watermelons tomorrow.  Is that really what I'm talking about?  I never know when to believe Paul, because you'll believe when you think you have a fact,  and then he's laughing at you. 
[02:41:00]  Behind your back.  I just write it off as horse shit.  See?  Wow.  How many times do you think he says stupid white boys, Paul Mooney?  I never like an effect on blood vessels.  Told you.  So let's fucking experiment, man.  No, it's...  All the time you talk...  Oh, look at him.  The little porch mark eating warm up.  You know, that is true.  Here we are.  I only wish people could see the face.  The white person's face is the greatest.  I was...  I know.  It really does.  Isn't it the best?  It's the best.  That is fucked up, because I was... 
[02:41:30]  Last time I was eating watermelon, I had a fucking huge heart on.  Did you really?  I was getting my dick sucked at the time.  But it was amazing.  The craziest person on the fucking planet.  You like the fact that he threw a huge in there, too?  Huge.  I know.  What am I...  I know.  You have to make it a...  Just a giant heart on.  Yeah.  Any excuse to describe your cock size-wise.  Fucking raining.  My big dick's going to get wet.  All right.  We got it. 
[02:42:00]  You're right.  What the fuck?  There's no reason for that.  What an ass.  I didn't know that.  Wow.  Watermelon, huh?  You came with a lot of facts today.  Yeah.  I know.  Some of them false.  Some of them true.  Oh, come on.  Yeah, the Meryl Streep is bullshit.  Meryl Streep is playing Harriet Tubman.  No, no.  You sound like Congress.  He comes in here.  He's lying.  Just put him on the arrest.  He's lying.  I looked it up on IMDB.  She's playing Harriet Tubman.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  You didn't look it up?  I looked it up.  So he hasn't lied yet.  He's playing Harriet Tubman.  I don't know if they're doing like a reimagining of it. 
[02:42:30]  How is she playing Harriet Tubman?  Or she's actually going to be a black woman.  Are they going to put her in blackface, you think?  No, they're not going to do a blackface.  Because that shit's not...  They're doing like a reimagining, like race.  The whole...  Because I read the synopsis.  It's that race doesn't matter in this.  It's going to be a white woman playing it.  Why?  And they're just going to continue to...  That's terrible.  Stupid Hollywood.  Her performance would be brilliant.  I think...  She could pull it off.  What was her bomb?  I think.  Not that I watch Meryl Streep movies.  Did she ever have a bomb? 
[02:43:00]  I don't know.  Every actor and actress has had a bomb.  I can't figure one for her.  She used to be...  Wait.  She did TV before all this.  She did television.  Did she?  Did she?  No.  No, she did.  It was in that movie with Robert De Niro when she was young.  Deer Hunter.  There was the...  Deer Hunter.  Sure.  Because she was...  What was the name of that show?  Oh, God.  She really was in a series?  I think so.  I'll have to look back.  I'm sure she's had a couple of bombs, though.  She has to.  Let's cold case her.  I think she was in Good Times.  Yeah.  I think it was Good Times. 
[02:43:30]  She played Thelma.  Yes.  No.  Wow, that's some acting.  Let's cold case her.  Don't you love cold case?  I love cold case.  Oh, I love that show.  Whoever invented that.  They invented it so old actors and actresses could work.  Yeah, yeah.  Let's cold case it so we can hire them.  Because you go, that's where they are.  Wait a minute.  Please, let's talk about...  What is this show where they are?  Medians are...  I cannot believe what it...  My daughter made me watch it.  Kardashians?  Uh... 
[02:44:00]  What?  What the hell is that about?  And we talk about that all the time.  That looks like some old white woman.  Oh, Bruce Jenner.  How sad.  Oh, it's the saddest thing.  Olympic hero.  It's an Olympic hero.  You don't like his kids don't care.  Yeah.  You don't like his burn victim wig?  He wears a burn victim wig.  That's not a wig?  I know, but it looks like a burn victim wig.  It looks like an old lesbian.  Fucking terrible.  You said it.  You just said it.  A lot of people said it.  That's not new.  I don't think the lesbians are going to be happy with that statement.  That's right.  Danny's still looking for the Harriet Tubman movie. 
[02:44:30]  Did you lie in fuck?  Of course.  You think?  A reimagining?  Would you stop it?  Dude, I fucking believed it.  I was completely lying.  That was good.  The fact that you mentioned IMDB legitimized it to me.  Like you would do anything with that computer, but look at pussy.  Why would I buy that?  Wow.  Jesus.  I am a dope.  Nice.  That's funny.  Yeah, no.  The race doesn't matter.  Oh, my God. 
[02:45:00]  No.  It just opens it up to, you know, help out the races.  Why should race matter as far as who's playing who?  Spike Lee would have fucking been running.  Yeah.  He wouldn't be happy about that.  Yeah, going bullshit crazy.  Wait a minute.  Did you see Spike Lee on this show?  It freaked me.  Who looks like Jimmy the Cricket?  But anyway, look.  Yes, it does.  It freaked me out.  He's sitting there.  There's some show about, you know, wasn't your great-grandfather George Russell or Jefferson? 
[02:45:30]  Oh, I saw that show.  Some shit.  I mean.  They track where they come from.  Celebrity's genealogy of the trees.  I mean, this is, we're talking about the history of slavery.  Of course, there's white people in my family.  What if this is a surprise to Spike?  And he's proud of it?  Oh, really?  These people owned his, they owned his, wait, he was proud to find out he has white in his  They all acted stupid.  Like, this is a, this is a surprise?  Well, I think he's proud of it because, just think of it, if the plantation owner wasn't having 
[02:46:00]  sex, it really meant she was fucking ugly.  So, you've got to kind of look and go, at least I had some attractive people in my, in  my family.  But I don't like the idea.  Way to make lemonade.  I don't like the idea.  Really?  Yeah.  But I don't like the idea of people pretending that, like with Jefferson.  Grapes and make grape soda.  You know, Jefferson.  I told you before, it's just Jefferson.  Right.  What was the mistress's name he had on the baby's mind?  Oh, yeah.  Sally.  Sally.  A whole nother family side of the family.  Sally.  Hey.  Well, she was half-sister to his wife. 
[02:46:30]  What do you want?  Wow, that's even more twisted.  It had to be a family thing.  Bring in Sam.  Huh?  Did we do this last time you were here?  Yeah, we did.  That's great.  No, our guy, Sam.  One of our guys is related to Thomas Jefferson.  We're convinced.  And he swears he has no black in him.  He's not all white.  Oh, he is black.  Get Sam in here.  Did we do this?  If we did last time, I'm sorry.  Call the police.  By the way, the Jiminy Cricket thing is hilarious.  Great.  Take a look at the monitor.  That is.  Oh, man.  That is perfect.  Mr. Mooney, legit.  This is Sam Roberts, and he is related to Thomas Jefferson. 
[02:47:00]  With that nappy hair, please give me a break.  I know, right?  Tell him.  Because he won't listen.  Exactly.  Tell him.  They're all in denial because he wants to be a fake white boy.  He's got razor bumps.  It doesn't matter.  They're all fake white people.  They want to be under the illusion of inclusion.  I think we found the whitest black guy on the planet.  Every one of those white men, those black women with no bras in them, big black titties,  big black asses, you know they slept with them.  That white man will screw a doorknob.  Are you kidding?  Sam?  I'm just saying. 
[02:47:30]  It was known Thomas Jefferson.  What's his full name?  Sam Boe?  Come on.  Give me a break.  Give me a break.  Don't even get into it.  It's sad.  It's tragic.  It's not even open for discussion with Mr. Mooney.  It's not Jefferson.  It's my relative that there's no black blood.  Man, we've been telling him that since he started.  Oh, give me a break.  And he loves dating black women.  It doesn't even matter that.  If the Klan comes in here, you guys will take them right to him.  Keep it real.  Don't bother us.  He's a man.  What do you mean if the Klan comes in here?  Have you looked at him?  No, he used to be Klan. 
[02:48:00]  I can tell when they're recovering.  I was sitting there.  They found out he was Italian.  They tried to hang him, too.  You're a what?  My name is Anthony Cumia, and I'm a racist.  He's recovering.  They all clap.  Same you've done.  He doesn't even want to talk to you.  Look, he doesn't even want to look at you.  No, it gets me insane.  You're a disgrace.  I can't stand it.  Yeah.  You've just wrecked Paul Mooney's day.  It's the whole thing.  All these little kids are always, I'm biracial.  What does that mean?  You can prove one of your parents are white? 
[02:48:30]  Get out of here.  Well, look at that.  And he's getting out of here.  Beat it.  They're going to say, scram you.  Confused young man.  With snappy hair.  Listen, if slavery came back tomorrow, I'd see him out there picking cotton.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Absolutely.  My dad's coming to get me.  Yeah.  Keep thinking.  Paul Mooney playing Caroline, man.  All weekend.  I highly recommend you see Paul if you've never gone.  I have a prior question for you.  Nice.  I wanted to ask you.  Go ahead. 
[02:49:00]  There's a video online from around the time that Star Crazy was taped, where he's doing  an interview.  You've probably seen it where the interview didn't happen in the morning because the audio  was fucked up.  Oh, he hated it.  What's his name?  That's what you're going to ask me.  No, no, no, no, no.  Okay.  It was like 1980.  And he was doing the interview, and he's a little bit...  Do you know the interview I mean?  He's a little bit...  He seems like he's had a few drinks, and the guy...  If you don't know the interview, it's on YouTube, I think.  I just wanted to know how close that was to the real prior, because he seemed like he  was a really tough guy to talk to when he'd had a few drinks. 
[02:49:30]  Yeah, like a really...  When Richard was on the drugs, he was a tough period.  I just wish I could...  I wish you knew the interview I meant, because it's a sign of prior most people haven't seen.  It's just like him being interviewed when he's under the influence.  Drugs make you...  You're Superman.  You think you can do things...  Whenever I was with Richard, and he was drunk, and with the drugs and the mixture of  it, we'd always have to fight our way out of things, because they'd come up and  white men would come up and say something, and I'd go, oh my God, there's going  to be a fight.  They'd say something.  He'd punch him right in the face.  Richard was a trip. 
[02:50:00]  That interview...  The drugs do it.  The drugs do it.  Have you seen that interview, or no?  Oh, yeah.  With, what's-his-face?  Just some local guy who was doing it for his school.  Richard was loaded.  I have never gotten up to see anywhere until I did this movie with Gene Wilder.  He hated...  Gene Wilder attracts pussy.  Hated him.  He really just hated him.  Oh, really?  Why did he hate him?  He couldn't stand him.  Wow.  They worked well together, though.  No, but...  Come on, it's brilliant.  People do work well together.  Yeah, I understand.  They couldn't stand each other.  He said Gene was attracting, like, young boys, and...  Yeah, he's hammered...  Oh, did he? 
[02:50:30]  He talked about Gene like a dog.  He couldn't stand each other.  I didn't know that.  Oh, shit.  That's fantastic.  I never knew that they didn't...  Did Gene like him or no?  He was scared.  Well, Gene was scared of him.  They all were afraid of Richard.  Because Richard was hot and cold.  He ran hot and cold.  So, I remember when they first went to do the...  What's the first one?  Uh, we...  When they went to the prison.  When they went to the prison.  Star Crazy, that's it.  Yeah, Star Crazy.  That fucking...  Oh, I don't care.  It's okay.  Oh, I don't mind.  I'll tell it.  Yeah.  That Sidney Portier called me up and wanted me to... 
[02:51:00]  Said, I want you to rehearse with Pryor.  Because Richard doesn't like to rehearse.  They want me to rehearse with Gene.  Me to do everything that Richard was doing.  And I was to the curb.  I didn't have anything.  And I said, well, why are you picking me to do this?  They actually wanted me to babysit.  You know?  I said, well...  He said, but the only problem is we can only pay you to be an extra.  Whatever.  I said, I'm not in that gill.  I'm in the AFTRA, SAG.  You know?  And I said, you have to pick one of the gills I'm in.  In the writer's gill.  I'm in that.  Pick one of them and pay me for that. 
[02:51:30]  Other than that, I...  So, I didn't go.  And Richard was so loaded.  I didn't even go to his house and bitch to him.  And he would tell me, oh, we're going to have so much fun.  I wasn't going.  And I just...  You know, sometimes it's just enough.  I see Sidney now, and he bows.  Because he remembers.  Yeah.  And they lost so much money on that movie because Richard walked off of it.  Oh, did he?  Yeah.  They had to go find it.  Yes.  Because they tried to make a watermelon joke.  They tried to be funny.  And he walked off of it.  But if I'd have been on the set, he never would have walked off because we'd have got him.  So, they wanted you for cheap money to rehearse with Gene and to babysit Richard. 
[02:52:00]  And they didn't want to pay you actor money.  Nope.  What dummies.  What a bad move.  That's not...  That's what they all do.  Look at...  Money makes people do it.  What are the schools they closed because they put something in the lights or something that  was deprimental to the kids?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  The fluorescent lights.  Those are not expensive lights.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  They did it because they're trying to get away...  They're trying to be cheap.  Not have to double back and pay twice as much.  So, Pryor walked off because of a racial joke they wanted to put in.  How did he do that when, you know, Blazing Saddles, he wrote on that. 
[02:52:30]  But that's different.  And there was a lot of racial...  Blazing Saddles was a different thing.  They were terrified of Richard.  Yeah.  And Richard wrote all that stuff and then he walked off.  He was loaded.  He caught a train there.  He went to...  He was scared to fly.  He caught a train there.  And he got there and the studio...  They were frightened by him so they hired...  What's-his-name is dead.  He always took Richard's part.  Oh, Cleavon Little.  Yeah.  Cleavon, yeah.  Didn't Pryor find out that he didn't get Blazing Saddles by Cleavon himself?  Didn't he just say, like, I got this movie Blazing Saddles and that was how Richard found out? 
[02:53:00]  Yeah.  Well, Richard had come back.  Richard was a slow...  Richard had went there and then he came back.  But Pryor was supposed to play that role?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  The studio was afraid of him.  And wasn't Gregory Hines in History of the World Part 1, wasn't that supposed to be Richard, but then he got hurt?  Yeah, it was supposed to be Richard.  It's always...  Jesus Christ.  Then he had the fire.  That's the way Hollywood is.  Wow.  At one time they were terrified of Richard.  Then they went in love.  They run hot and cold.  That's the way they are.  They're like some mistress.  Was there anybody he wouldn't tell to go fuck themselves?  Who?  Prior, or would he have told anybody to go fuck?  I've gotten between Richard to keep him from beating up people, producers, attacking people. 
[02:53:30]  Who did he go...  What's his name?  I'm going to tell you who he went after.  He was going to beat him up.  Was it a producer?  Yeah, the one that created all the funny stuff.  The one that played the gangsters in the old movies.  He's dead now.  Let me think of his name.  All right.  He played a gangster.  A tough guy.  All the time?  In movies.  In the old movies.  The black and white movies.  And he came in to be a big producer?  Edward G. Robinson?  No, no, not him.  But he created all...  Richard went after him.  I had to get up and stop him from beating him up. 
[02:54:00]  Why did he want to attack him?  Because he was stealing our stuff.  What movies did this guy create?  I got a TV show.  Norman Lear?  No, not Norman.  No, please.  Norman Lear beat himself up.  Norman Lear, a very accurate depiction of black life and things like good times.  Yeah.  You don't think so?  Yeah, all of you did.  No, I don't think it was.  That's why that Dr. Crazy, that's why she said, don't N-double-A-C-P me. 
[02:54:30]  She said that.  Don't N-double-A-C-P me.  Because the Jews created the N-double-A-C-P.  I was never into that.  I said, I'm not a colored person.  Yeah.  There's people who name their dogs that I'm not a Negro.  I'm not any of that crap.  I used to tell them white folks.  I caused all kinds of trouble back in the day.  I said, I said, I'm not in the air, though.  Back in the day, you just had us convinced Meryl Streep was playing Harriet Tubman.  We're talking about that.  I'm taking you back.  Come on, you're too young.  I would say, my old Southern expression, I got it from the white folks.  I said, I'm free, white, and 21. 
[02:55:00]  Don't mess with me.  No, but that was created to control blacks.  To control them.  Really?  When was the first black head of the N-double-A-C-P?  It was recently the first black head.  It was a long time that there wasn't a black head.  It was always a Jewish head.  Really?  Yeah.  Come on, now you're lying.  No, I'm not.  I don't remember.  Why would they do that?  For years.  You said a Jewish head.  You sound like a Nazi.  Jewish head.  We're going to try to keep it alive in the lab. 
[02:55:30]  Oh, man.  I did not know that.  That's why the Jews killed me.  They all think they're white.  It is so funny.  It's so funny.  Those Germans, that's who was white.  Yeah.  And they told them, we're going to show you just how black you can be.  Get in that oven.  Wow.  Sorry.  Wow.  But it's the truth.  Well, well, they were.  You want to hate, hate a German.  Why don't we?  They were, uh.  Danny, can you find black Sheldon Leonard? 
[02:56:00]  You're good.  No, I'm not.  I just read it from a fucking phone call.  Sheldon Leonard?  Yes.  That's exactly.  I guess I could have made believe I was good.  That's exactly who he was going to be.  Oh, Chris from Long Island gets the credit.  He used to always, he always played.  He was a gangster in old black and white movies.  All the old movies, he played gangster.  Sheldon Leonard.  And what did he do, Ant?  Do you know?  You know your TV.  Sheldon Leonard produced, uh, some of those shows like, um, God damn.  Uh, oh yeah.  How about I look on, I spy, right?  I don't know.  I've never heard of him.  Yeah, I think so. 
[02:56:30]  Yeah, I don't know.  It was Sheldon Leonard.  So what was he stealing?  He was stealing the jokes or the concepts?  Oh, okay.  Andy Griffith?  I Dream of Jeannie?  Yeah.  All of his stuff.  Yes.  Yeah, yeah.  All of the heavy stuff.  Dick Van Dyke?  No kidding.  All the heavy stuff.  And Richard wanted to beat him up.  Yeah.  Somebody told me a story about Pryor recently where I think it was, whoever was doing his  record, was, was Geffen, uh, doing his records at one point?  David Geffen?  Somebody.  Where Pryor went to the record executive, uh, and said, I think he had a gun with him, 
[02:57:00]  and he said, how much are you paying me for this?  And the guy's like, why are you asking?  Because he wanted to see if his manager was stealing from him.  So, fuck it, they told Richard what he was getting paid, and Richard realized what he  was getting from his manager and said, I'm going to go over and kill him.  And the guy called, and so look, Pryor's on his way over, and he's a gun.  He's going to kill you.  And he's not happy.  Yeah.  True story?  Yeah.  Wow.  Richard would get a gun in a minute.  I just, I threw so many guns away.  Really?  I threw so many guns away.  His, uh, we call her the, the, the, the countess, uh, Patricia, the little blonde that 
[02:57:30]  he met who was a stewardess in San Francisco and pimped her all her money and then  took her car, a bunch of stuff.  And she ended up having this affair with Billy Dee Williams.  That's how it's coming.  They stopped speaking.  But anyway, I just saw Billy and my God, it was scary.  But anyway, we'll talk about that.  Uh, he's just rubbed up to, he looks like something living under a bridge now.  Really?  Oh no, it's scary.  But that drugs and liquor and all that stuff, it's lethal.  It gets to you eventually.  It gets to you eventually, right?  But anyway, uh, he did all this with this woman and, uh, she used to go steal for him. 
[02:58:00]  Patricia used to go and she was a good booster.  She'd go steal to feed him, you know, and do all this stuff.  It's just, just weird.  And I used to, she called me up and Freddie Pence was alive and she said, Paul, it's about  four in the morning.  She said, you gotta get over here.  They've got guns.  They're acting crazy.  And Freddie, you gotta help me.  And I went over there and I took the guns and everything and threw them away.  And then Freddie was acting stupid because Freddie wanted to be Richard.  And that's when he was, uh, he was banging, uh, Raquel Welch.  Who was?  Freddie Pence.  Oh, wow.  Damn.  Oh yeah. 
[02:58:30]  That's, that's why I met Raquel.  Oh yeah.  Oh yeah.  She was in her prime.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That, that half Indian.  She was in her prime.  Oh, she's half Indian.  I love Indian chicks.  They're big pussies.  She had great pussies.  Yeah.  Indian chicks have the best pussies.  Native American chicks have the best pussies.  Really?  Yeah.  They're big.  They are.  They're fantastic.  You've been on a reservation?  I know.  Dude, they got to carry the kid around.  You know how many times I've seen a fat pussy and I've said to a girl, what's your nationality?  I'm half Cherokee.  Really? 
[02:59:00]  That's a turn on Jimmy.  Love.  When I, when I hear this.  Is it Freddie, is that not a trip?  That's pretty cool.  Oh yeah.  And he used to go out with, uh, Pam Greer.  And that was prior or a Freddie?  So Freddie was fucking everybody.  Freddie was a trip.  So why would he kill himself?  He was getting all the fucking pussy.  He wanted.  The managers, all of them, drugs, drugs, drugs.  He was like this.  I mean, I went on the set once.  Pinky, skinny, right?  I was on the show, no, like this.  And, and I said, and I said it out loud.  I said, what are you on?  What is your problem? 
[02:59:30]  He was like this.  And I told the manager, all of them, I said, you guys have him on the studio.  I said, you guys have him on drugs to keep him going.  They were part of it too.  Yeah.  They all got to be a part of it.  Scatman Crothers tell you to shut the fuck up.  He's got to work.  Shut up.  I need this gig.  Is he going to man?  No, when I first met Freddie, he was going with Lenny Bruce's daughter, Kitty.  And she's still around.  She's a jazz singer.  Yeah.  I talked to her all the time.  Kitty.  He was going with Kitty.  Kitty was 18.  Wow.  He was, he was going out with Kitty Bruce.  Did you know Lenny Bruce?  Huh?  Yeah.  I had met him. 
[03:00:00]  Hmm.  Did Pryor like Lenny, or did he just kind of like him because he kicked the door open  or he fell?  No, he loved him from Lenny Bruce.  Oh, he did?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, he really liked Lenny Bruce.  But he was, the one he was fascinated with was Bill Cosby.  Why?  Really, yeah.  Because Bill had did the crossover there and stuff.  We discuss it all the time.  I said, you're so much funnier than Bill Cosby would ever be.  Please stop it.  Marilyn Monroe was into, what's her name?  Jean Harlow.  And that was her idol.  And Jean Harlow, all she was famous for was not wearing a bra.  Marilyn Monroe was a comedian and an actress.  She was a bunch of stuff.  It's always like that.  Do you think Cosby, I always thought Cosby must be secretly jealous of Pryor. 
[03:00:30]  Like the more you hear Cosby talking politically and making these statements of how he feels,  and Richard said it on stage, there had to be that little jealous thing that he couldn't  say the things that Pryor could say.  I don't know if he was jealous.  I know that in his old age, he just changed.  He wasn't like that when white folks was loving him and he was loving them.  He was ambassador for white people.  Let's keep it real.  A lot of people saying they can't hear Paul.  I turned up your mic.  Oh, you're kidding.  Who said that?  A couple of listeners.  You're saying some great shit.  Oh, you're kidding.  They can't hear me?  They can. 
[03:01:00]  Just do it a little bit far back from the light.  Okay, let's get a little closer.  They can't hear me?  Yeah, you hear me.  Well, somebody white had something to do with this.  Who in the studio?  Can you hear him now?  Did that nappy-haired fake white boy go in there and change it?  That scares me because this is great shit.  Yeah, it's amazing.  It scares me, too.  Can you hear Paul now?  Can you hear me?  Because it's satellite.  These mics, you've got to kind of eat them a little bit.  Yeah, you were far back.  I didn't know this was satellite.  Oh, you can say what I mean.  I'm out of here.  This is satellite?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  This ain't going to sell me seats.  You mean the Martians are hearing this? 
[03:01:30]  I'm out of here.  That shit goes up in his face.  Come on, it's great.  I could barely hear Mooney.  Can you hear him now?  Can you hear me now?  Come on.  No, he was off the mic for a few minutes.  Okay.  You were okay.  All right, good.  I hope so.  How did you avoid getting caught up in that?  Because you seem to always be a pretty sober, mentally healthy guy.  How did you avoid all that?  Because my grandmother raised me.  So I was thinking like an old Southern.  She had a big influence on me.  So, you know, drugs and all that wasn't for me.  Did you have your day, though? 
[03:02:00]  We all like dabbled a little bit.  No.  No dabbling.  You never dabbled at all?  No dabbling.  No curious about no damn drugs.  Do you drink?  No.  No.  Nothing?  No.  Never?  No.  Wow.  So I'll be on the Supreme Court judging you.  I mean, that's a rarity for a stand-up comic, is what I'm saying.  Of course it is.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah.  Hey, how did you meet Richard Pryor?  Oh, that's it.  Read the book.  Read the book.  My book is on.  You don't feel like reading?  I'll promote it, but I don't want to read.  A white man that doesn't read.  Now, that's a movie.  Now, that's.  You know what?  Isn't that a movie you want to see? 
[03:02:30]  Look.  Isn't that a film you want to see?  You know what?  Sure.  I actually read a lot of the book, and I remember the story.  It was at a fucking party, and the first thing Pryor said to him, I think Paul was with  a woman, and Pryor walked up, and again, I'm paraphrasing, and said something about  let's have a threesome.  That was my sister.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, and I threw him out of the, it was in a, we did it in a hotel.  Yeah, and I threw him out of the first interaction.  I didn't like it.  The book is called Black is the New White.  It's in paperback.  In paperback.  I really should read this one.  It's great.  You've got to read it.  It was on the New York bestseller list. 
[03:03:00]  You made the list.  Good, good.  Good.  I'll put it on my Kindle.  A little vacation coming up.  Maybe I read Paul Mooney's book.  Yeah, the Kindle's unbelievable, but it starts off, it's stuff you want to hear about.  It's really, really fucking interesting.  You're on the ranch.  Just let one of your slaves read it, too.  Oh, that's right.  They don't read.  You're looking at the wrong person, my friend.  Once they start reading, they start getting ideas.  Oh, oh, yeah.  All right.  Oh, you've got to watch that.  Don't want them to know.  It's like they pretend they're going to go swimming when they really try to get away.  Yes.  You want to take a break real fast? 
[03:03:30]  Yeah, I've got to pee.  Sweetie, but you're hanging out a little bit.  Yeah, yeah.  Paul's going to be at Caroline's, and wow, man, he's great.  I've seen him many fucking times.  212-757-4100 for tickets for Caroline's.  Tonight, tomorrow.  And Sunday.  Sunday night.  I know I'm going to stop by one night and watch him finally in the city, but just a great,  great, always topical show, always fucking new material.  You really are amazing to comedians.  Always new material.  Every time you fucking see him, there's like, whatever's happening, there's material on it.  So it's a great show.  And thanks for the material of the day from the nappy-head white boy. 
[03:04:00]  I mean, he's just too much for me.  I thought you guys were kidding.  No, no, no.  Oh, my God.  We're all ashamed of him.  He's scary.  Oh, yeah.  It's amazing how no race wants to claim him.  We all just want to give him to each other.  Let's put him on an island.  Just back and forth.  Let's put him with little Wayne.  More with Paul Moon.  Stay there.  And now, the Opie and Anthony Show.  Mysterious Arizona.  Excellent. 
[03:04:30]  Paul.  Yeah.  Are you a Metallica fan?  No.  Is this white boy music to you?  No, it's just music.  It's just music?  Music for the mentally insane.  This really does make you want to just pick up things and throw them through the window. 
[03:05:00]  Busy show.  Paul Mooney playing Carolines tonight, tomorrow, and Sunday.  And we also have T.J. Miller, our old friend, stopping by to say hi.  I don't have your plug sheet.  Where are you going to be?  Gotham.  I'm sorry.  Gotham Comedy Club tonight through Sunday as well.  What time are your shows?  Are they early, right?  No, there's...  I mean, it's the same.  It's like 8.30 and 10.30.  And then I've got that 8 o'clock, like 10 o'clock, 11.45.  I like that 11.45 Saturday show.  Yeah, it's better than...  Late show Fridays are a fucking nightmare.  Yeah. 
[03:05:30]  You don't have a voice, sir.  Who?  You.  Right now?  Yeah.  Yeah, I've been yelling a lot and getting high.  That'll do it.  Those two things combined is dangerous.  Do you know there were no such thing as late shows till I came along?  You know that.  In this town.  What?  You invented?  It was always the perfect show.  The white show.  8.30, not remember?  The white show.  Till I came along.  I created that whole thing.  Yeah.  I learned a lot staying at Caroline's after the white shows.  Yeah, but late shows.  I brought the late shows. 
[03:06:00]  There was no such thing.  Any of the clubs.  Till I came along.  That crowd of Caroline's drastically changed when the clock struck 12.  Holy shit.  Why do you do the late shows instead of the early ones?  You prefer them?  Yeah.  No, it's not going to be preferred.  They did it.  They were hoping no one came.  But they got fooled.  Did you see the wedding?  Well, I saw the footage.  Chelsea Clinton, of course, getting married.  They said no helicopters.  She had all these rules.  Right.  How about no cameras?  Right. 
[03:06:30]  They just wanted a close-up angle.  Did she look bad?  Come on.  I didn't see it.  All brides are supposed to look good.  You don't think she pulled it off?  She's not a pretty thing.  She used to be all right.  Something happened, though.  No, come on.  I said all right.  I didn't say like Ron Kelly Wells.  And not me.  And not by white standards.  There was a drop-off in the last few years.  She's not cute by what white people say is cute.  Yeah, by someone that rich and famous, she's probably a two and a half of what she could  be doing.  Try zero.  Not still fuck her out of respect for the office. 
[03:07:00]  For the administration.  For the office.  No, no.  For the store, you would.  A serial killer would never go near her.  They like them young and white and very attractive.  Yeah.  Yeah, she's not the prettiest girl.  Who?  Chelsea.  I don't think she's as ugly as people thought, though.  She got okay.  Yeah, they used to say, you know, she'd eat biscuits.  Yeah, they were really mean.  When the news actually had to say, like, hey, leave her alone.  Yeah, right.  Like, they really did.  When Clinton was first elected, the press was like, all right, look, let's leave the 
[03:07:30]  girl alone.  She has enough to deal with.  That hair.  Mother's no beauty.  Oh, no.  No, she's not.  No, definitely not.  Oh, no.  And she looks like her mom.  And the Post now is getting her making the same face as they used to get Hillary making.  Where Hillary would just be all bug-eyed and her mouth would be open.  She'd be pointing at someone, somebody.  And that's the picture they throw in the paper for her.  And now they're getting.  Just showing pure hatred for her.  Yeah.  Now they got the daughter making the same dumb faces. 
[03:08:00]  Sure.  So what's come out about the wedding?  It's only photos?  There's just been a few photos released.  They haven't.  Yeah.  No paparazzi shots.  No.  No?  Just some.  Yeah, they don't.  What do they want?  They're not like stars where they want the, you know, where they want that shit.  They wanted a private wedding.  And they got it.  Yeah.  It was one of those ones where she's a celebrity.  It's like, please, no one bother me.  And everyone's like, fine.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Here's where the wedding's going to be.  Here's where, yeah, the celebrities. 
[03:08:30]  Yeah.  I want my wedding to be private.  I want this.  No helicopters.  And it's going to be right here at this time.  Send a press release out.  And that's where the helicopters come up.  Secret Service changes the game, though.  And the Secret Service is keeping you away.  You stay the fuck away.  When there might be a chance of a stinger missile hitting your news helicopter.  Yeah.  That's how you keep the paparazzi away.  Just guys with fucking machine guns.  What is this thing I heard about?  They were upset about somebody praying somewhere.  Here in this town.  Oh, the mosque? 
[03:09:00]  The mosque?  The Ground Zero mosque?  Yeah.  Yeah, they want to build a mosque two blocks from where the trade center was.  The building they want to put it in, the wheels of one of the planes actually fell through the roof of.  That's how close it is.  It's damaged.  They've got to fix it.  What's the thought of that, Mr. Moore?  There's this insensitivity that people are saying, like, look, all right, we understand there's a legal right and constitutional right to worship.  And they have every right to build a mosque there.  But people are saying they shouldn't.  It's kind of insensitive to the people. 
[03:09:30]  It's kind of like that mountain where the Indians have their burial grounds and the white folks put their picture up there.  Yeah, kind of like that, huh?  Yeah, that will be it.  Kind of like that.  Kind of like that.  I just hate how CNN and all the news cases were like.  That's a point.  I know.  You don't like Mount Rushmore.  Kind of like that?  Yeah.  Interesting.  Interesting.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But when you're white, it's all right.  I get it.  Is there a burial ground there? 
[03:10:00]  I didn't know that.  Ah, you know, look, Moody just gave you.  You're screwing squalls and you don't know this?  Come on.  Squalls have big pussies, but you don't know?  Yeah, yeah.  My historical knowledge is very selective.  Yeah, he focuses mostly on vagina.  Well, it's a big, fat, squall pussy up there.  Now, got a value related?  Wow.  It is kind of, where is it, like Black Hills of South Dakota or something?  I don't know if it's South Dakota or Utah.  Is it South Dakota?  South Dakota.  South Dakota, yeah.  Wow.  And, yeah, a lot of Indian action up there.  And then they carve their heads. 
[03:10:30]  You know, sometimes it takes a little bit of perspective.  From Paul.  That's funny.  I think Paul just ended the argument that's been going on for the last couple weeks.  You couldn't find four big, larger, whiter heads.  Right.  They really are big white heads.  More havoc on the Indians.  Right.  Wow.  All right.  I'll give you that one.  Well, moving on.  Damn. 
[03:11:00]  Thank God we all agree that the mosque should be built down there.  Right, Anthony?  Absolutely.  No, I just think that Mount Rushmore should be fucking bombed.  Right.  Yeah, let's even the playing field.  Right is right.  Just carve some headdresses on those fucking people.  Exactly.  Put an Indian burial ground.  Wow.  Wow.  Do we look stupid today?  Well, didn't they want to put an Indian on there as a fifth face or something?  There was something about that.  Oh, come on.  No, no.  It was talked about.  You look cute, buddy.  No, it never happened.  Just to kind of make it politically correct.  Yes. 
[03:11:30]  Some of them didn't want to put it.  What Indian?  Charlie Hill?  I hear they wanted to carve Meryl Streep's face on there.  Playing an Indian.  Playing an Indian.  Now you got it.  Playing Pocahontas.  Yes, it's Pocahontas.  Put it right up next to friggin'.  Who's on there?  Who is this?  Washington.  Arrested after treating a manhunt.  The guy from Arizona, I think, and his fiancée.  His not attractive fiancée.  Hey, TJ Miller's in Yogi Bear, and he filmed that in New Zealand for five months. 
[03:12:00]  Oh, yeah.  You ever been in New Zealand, Paul Mooney?  No.  It seems like a very strange place.  No.  You would love it.  There's bungee jumping there.  You're kidding.  Yeah, I know.  I hear there's a lot of sheep fucking.  Isn't there a lot of sheep fucking?  The sheep-to-person ratio there is 10 to 1, I think, right now.  Why?  For every one person, there's 10 sheep.  Two sheep for every boy.  Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. 
[03:12:30]  The Maoris have a very high rate of alcoholism.  Yes, Once Were Warriors, great film.  Temuara Morrison, fucking.  Fun fact.  Yes.  Really good film about the alcoholism in that community.  I like the Maori people, the native people, and.  They don't play fucking games, either.  No, not at all.  And it's interesting because they were invaded, but unlike the United States, the people that  came to colonize them weren't able to beat them, essentially, when they fought against 
[03:13:00]  them.  Got their asses kicked.  So, yeah, totally.  So now the Maori kind of coexists there, but sort of are more dangerous, and it kind of  never quite took over.  What color are they?  They're sort of a darker, kind of a light brown.  Yeah, there's a weird racism with them, too.  Like, the Maoris are seen as, like, black, and I don't know who the other tribe is, but  there was a racism there, too, with Tom.  Why didn't they take our advice with some anthrax blankets?  That's good.  Oh, that works. 
[03:13:30]  I'm just saying, how do you not kick the ass of indigenous people that don't have better  weapons than you?  It's usually very easy.  What do they do wrong?  They're just real, real tough.  The Maoris fought with those fucking sticks.  They were good fighters with those sticks.  I don't know what they were called.  Like Poe.  But they were a tunga stick or whatever it's called.  They were fucking rough fighters, man.  Yeah, a gun against a stick.  The stick loses.  You raise a good point.  So what?  They don't get along?  No, I mean, now they've kind of learned to coexist, but the Maori, there's some Maori 
[03:14:00]  comedians over there that were pretty funny, and they talk about kind of, because they  do, they experience, you know, they've experienced the racism throughout, but they never, they  were never, like, oppressed, because no one who moved there could be oppressed.  What the hell do you do in New Zealand when you're not filming?  You just, you bungee jump, and they have meat pie.  Do you roll down the hill in the big bowl?  Yeah, I did that.  I've seen that on TV.  I did do that.  It's the Winnie Mandela ride.  She puts you in a bunch of tires until the fire rolls you down.  You've seen the see-through big fucking ball you get inside of it. 
[03:14:30]  Is that zooming or something?  Something like that.  It was pretty fun, yeah.  Bumble boy.  I don't know if it's worth the money.  Yeah, it's like $60.  It's not worth the money.  It's rolled down a hill.  No?  No.  $60.  $60 American dollars?  You're telling me about ever having done it?  Yeah.  No, it's $60 Maori dollars.  How much American?  $1.50.  Worth it.  That'd be nothing.  You sound like Tori Spelling right now.  Yeah, your voice is really shocking.  Yeah, I kind of look like her right now, too.  We got info on Mount Rushmore for you, Paul Mooney.  This will make you a little happier.  Jerry, go ahead.  Yeah, I just wanted to say that there is a monument for the Native Americans in the Black 
[03:15:00]  Hills.  It's just up the road from Mount Rushmore.  And in fact, it's designed by the same guy who did Mount Rushmore.  Oh, yeah?  It's going to be, it's like five times bigger than Mount Rushmore.  What?  It's going to be three-dimensional.  Oh, they haven't built it yet?  Sir, everything in real life is three-dimensional.  Yes.  That's Crazy Horse, right?  It's three-dimensional, and they're still building it.  Oh, they're still building it.  Haven't they not been able to get funding for it? 
[03:15:30]  I think Mount Rushmore is three-dimensional.  Let's see, it's down the road.  You know, we've got to keep it separate.  It's something they're working on.  It's all about keeping it separate.  They're working on it.  They're working on it.  Wouldn't that be great if they made a mistake?  Instead of Crazy Horse, they put Crazy Whores?  Or Crazy Horse, and it's Mr. Ed?  No!  They're working on it.  We're working on it.  It's a work in progress.  Kind of like the spilling oil.  I think it's a funding issue.  I want to say it's a funding issue, but I knew that there was one, but they have not 
[03:16:00]  been able to finish it.  They ran out of money or something?  Yeah.  Selling up cigarettes to them?  No, they won't accept federal money for it, I think.  They want to have private funds.  I don't, obviously don't know, but there's something where they wouldn't accept funds.  It looks like Crazy Horse has a stroke.  They just need more money to, you know.  Fix him, yeah.  To fix him.  Yeah, right now he's crazy.  Now look, we've got a full house, so I'm just going to put it out there and you guys  decide if you want to do this.  You know Ira, our good friend Ira from the Jay Thomas Show.  Of course.  He's outside the studio with his hooker lady friend and her daughter. 
[03:16:30]  Of course we want to.  Yeah?  His hooker lady friend.  Yeah, I would think we'd need to get involved.  What are you talking about?  Let's start with Ira first and then we bring the women in.  So Paul could get a...  It's a hooker?  Try to guess Ira's nationality or religious affiliation.  Don't be scared, Paul.  This is Ira.  I'm scared.  Good morning, everybody.  Hi, Ira.  Hi, Ira.  How are you?  What does your hat say?  All right.  Assemblyman Michael Benedetto. 
[03:17:00]  Benedetto.  Yes.  You want to say hi to Paul Mooney?  How you doing, Paul?  Paul's a very funny, legendary comic.  Yes, I know this.  Used to hang out with Richard Pryor.  You know this.  Yes.  What do you know about Paul Mooney?  Paul Mooney, he's at the comedy club at 23rd Street, Gotham.  No, that's T.J. Miller.  No, that's me.  Wrong club, wrong race.  Totally different shows.  You couldn't have been wrong.  Different clubs.  You're scared, Paul. 
[03:17:30]  Well, the comedy club, Gotham.  We don't know what it is.  Ira smells bad.  It's great for them.  Oh, Jesus.  Would you smell his armpits, Jimmy?  No.  Oh, E-Rock.  E-Rock.  Oh, he smells sour.  E-Rock, we need you.  Like when you leave your wet clothes in the dryer for too long.  Oh.  He smells like that.  E-Rock, could you smell Ira's pits for us, please?  Oh, Jesus.  E-Rock, would you mind if E-Rock smelled your pits?  Sorry, Paul.  I apologize.  Well, if he wants to.  No.  Let him.  This is some shock jock stuff. 
[03:18:00]  I understand.  I'm sorry.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Sometimes we have to go back to some roots.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  Sometimes we've got to go back to our roots.  I'm really sorry.  Yeah.  Got a legend in studio.  This is us keeping it real.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Smell his armpits.  I'm sorry, Paul.  I'm dealing with the real issues.  Yes.  I want to acknowledge this is a bit hacky.  I'm like, Bobo, I'm like to live in English.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  All right.  All right.  I feel like I'm up in the moon.  Every time Bobo is over here, I feel like I'm up in the moon. 
[03:18:30]  I like it.  All right.  All right.  Ira, can you lift your arm up?  Oh, my God.  Yeah, I can lift my arm up.  Oh, good.  He's zig-heiling.  He's zig-heiling.  He's doing it.  Paul, would you like to see the zig-heiling?  Ira, you probably shouldn't do that.  I'm no joke.  He really is.  No.  It's not how you put your arm up.  Yeah.  Yeah, like this.  Yeah.  All right.  Sympathize it.  All right.  Lift your arm up.  Just sympathize it.  Put my arm up.  Okay.  All right.  Hold it up there.  Ira, take the mic. 
[03:19:00]  Ira, get in there.  All right.  All right.  Hold on.  Just put you over there.  Give a good one.  He made a face.  Now he's getting the mic.  No.  He smells like mothballs.  All right.  Yeah.  You don't have to humiliate the guy, really.  Yeah.  What's wrong with you?  Exactly.  He's with a prostitute.  Well, I'm better than Bobo.  All right.  Bobo's not even here.  Paul doesn't know who Bobo is.  Yeah, yeah.  He doesn't know.  Oh, Bobo.  He, he, he.  We didn't ask you to tell anybody either. 
[03:19:30]  He's a real estate.  Why is he?  Now he's a real estate.  Who's your friend?  Yeah.  Who's your friend out there?  Well, no.  Explain to Paul.  You like hookers, right?  They're not hookers.  What are they?  They're wonderful people.  Wonderful women.  That's not mutually exclusive.  Yeah.  They're wonderful people that you pay money to for their company.  No, I don't pay any money.  No?  No.  Do you, do you help with the bills?  She told me about her book. 
[03:20:00]  Oh, you're helping her with her book?  It's very, very interesting.  What's the book?  What's the book called?  It's about fellatio.  It's very, very nice.  And is she doing research with you for the book?  It's interesting.  It's very, very interesting.  Why is it interesting?  Is it a novel or a non-fiction?  She's, um, she wrote a book.  About fellatio?  You'll, you'll hear about it. 
[03:20:30]  All right.  Let's bring her in.  Yeah.  Can we bring her in?  Because he's not explaining anything.  And the daughter, too.  I think the daughter's very sexy.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I think Paul Moody's never coming back.  Yeah, she's got a nice, daughter's fucking juicy.  Paul, yeah.  All right.  Bring your friend in who has written a book about fellatio, apparently.  Step up to the microphone.  Oh, there's another mic over there.  Yeah.  And that's your daughter?  Yeah.  She's of age, right?  Of course.  Of course.  I like of course.  I wouldn't have her out of the house otherwise. 
[03:21:00]  So, what's your name, ma'am?  My name is Laverne Johnson.  Oh, we learned about Laverne last time, Ira.  How do you know Ira Laverne, if we could ask you?  I met Ira on the bus.  On the bus?  Oh, on the bus.  And she told me about her book.  What's the name of your book?  Well, it was Fellatio, the Art of Romancing a Cot.  Was this years ago?  Did you have to give up your seat for him?  How long ago was this?  Paul, you want to take this? 
[03:21:30]  But now it's fellatio, the forbidden foreplay.  Right?  What?  So you told Ira about that?  Yeah.  What made you decide to talk to him about the book?  We were talking about something, and it just came up in conversation.  Oh, okay.  As it usually does, too.  But you know Ira.  So what can you tell us about fellatio?  Or at least your version of it.  Well, fellatio is romancing the cock as opposed to just giving a blowjob.  Ah, romancing the cock.  Romancing the cock.  Romancing the cock. 
[03:22:00]  Remember, that was a fine movie.  Romancing the stones.  So it's jewels.  It's romancing the cock as opposed to a blowjob.  What's the difference?  You're playing with more than, you're playing with all of his parts.  The other parts besides just the head of the cock.  Oh, you lick the balls.  Yeah.  A little bit of everything.  You do lick the balls.  You put balls in your mouth.  The bigger difference is that we get off on giving it as well.  Oh.  That's the lovely daughter.  What's your name? 
[03:22:30]  Tykesha.  Hi, Tykesha.  Are you also an enjoyer of oral sex?  Mm-hmm.  Very much so.  Cool.  Wow.  What the fuck is going on?  I'm amazed.  I want women to know that now they can empower what they're doing as far as giving you a so-called blowjob.  Right.  What do most women do wrong, would you think?  I think what it is is that they're not into it because the guy is asking them to do it.  I think if they do it for themselves, they can enjoy it more, which is the difference. 
[03:23:00]  I don't know.  You would have to tell me because I don't have a cock.  So what do they do wrong?  Oh, man.  Honestly, yes.  Good question.  Jim Norton's ready with this.  What do they do wrong?  Stay after it's done?  Yeah, exactly.  Exactly.  Try kissing me?  Talking to me?  Leave the car door ajar when they get out?  I find that a lot of times is they don't understand that when they're in a rhythm, when there's a rhythm when you're getting your cock's up, 
[03:23:30]  and they stop the rhythm when you're starting to build, because a lot of it is rhythm-oriented.  A lot of times, not enough spit, not enough attention paid to the balls.  That means you're not talking to her.  See?  That's another thing.  You have to start talking to her.  She doesn't know that.  She doesn't talk back.  Her mouth is full.  She's listening.  She's listening.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Jimmy, really fast.  People are confused.  They think Keith Robinson's in the studio.  No, this is not Keith Robinson.  Yeah.  So how old is the daughter, if I could ask? 
[03:24:00]  21-12.  I'll take either one.  Ira, what makes a good blowjob?  Tea?  I don't want to say.  Why?  Nah, you could say.  You could spill the beans, Ira.  It's not a big secret.  What makes a good blowjob for you?  Yeah, let's go.  Yeah.  Well, I'm always a woman.  Yeah.  That's one of my primary requirements also, yeah. 
[03:24:30]  Jesus.  Yeah, with a woman, that's good.  Laverne, do you ever give Ira a blowjob?  Never.  Why not?  Friends don't do friends in this book.  You don't want to do Ira, huh?  No.  Does Ira ever try?  He doesn't turn me on like that.  He doesn't turn me on like that.  He never approached me like that.  No?  We're friends.  But do you think he's a sexy man or not particularly?  Well, it depends.  That's a no.  It's a no.  I'm trying to make a hit with a book.  Huh?  Yes.  Does the daughter have a boyfriend?  Oh, answer. 
[03:25:00]  No.  No, currently not.  I'm being stalked.  I have an ex-boyfriend.  Oh, no.  How long were you with him?  About six years.  Wow.  Are you 21?  No, I said 21-12.  Oh, 33.  All right.  So you went to Skype for six years and he can't let go.  No.  How long have you been split?  About four months.  Okay.  Those usually don't end very well.  Black guy, white guy.  He's mixed. 
[03:25:30]  He's Jewish and Spanish.  Oh, shit.  Oh, Ira.  Jewish and Spanish.  Are you guys hookers?  I'm confused by the hooker angle.  No hooker.  No, there are no hookers.  Derek?  I'm not a hooker.  No?  I'm a grandmother, as a matter of fact.  No offense, but Ira said that...  No, he didn't.  No.  I'm going to get the tape.  Didn't get the tape from the last time you were on, Ira.  Never.  Last time he was going off.  Yeah.  We don't know what Ira was saying.  Did he just come back from Atlantic City?  Maybe that was it. 
[03:26:00]  Yeah.  Okay.  Has anybody...  They're decent people.  Yeah, I know.  We never said they are.  Do you know how many prostitutes I've known in my life?  Decent people, too.  Yeah.  Nobody in two.  Hookers are decent people, especially.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  So you have a boyfriend who's stalking you, so you probably...  Have you hooked up with anybody since then?  Mm-hmm.  Really?  Yes.  But you don't have a new boyfriend yet.  You're still kind of mellowing out, maybe.  Yeah.  Trying to test the water.  Yeah.  Yeah.  How about a comedian in his 40s with a moderately okay career?  To kind of cleanse the palace. 
[03:26:30]  Is that your boy?  That is...  That's the sorbet of relationships.  Yeah, exactly.  I'll give you a really lousy one, which will kind of...  It's very sexy.  Where do you live?  Uh-oh.  We live in the Bronx.  He's going to want your telephone number two now.  No.  No.  No.  No.  Yeah.  No.  No.  No.  No.  Yeah.  No.  And she, you know, gives a good head.  Well, you don't know the daughter.  Great head.  You have great head?  You guys are obsessed with head in this family, huh? 
[03:27:00]  No, we're not.  No?  No.  Just writing books about it.  Just writing books about it.  And I'm serious about the book.  So here's what happened.  You were going down on somebody, and they're like, oh my God, that feels good.  No, they go into a different zone.  What?  Because he, her ex, he had a nickname for it.  What was the nickname?  Who?  What was the nickname?  Hookerhead.  Mm-hmm.  Hookerhead.  What's the problem with you two?  It was all love and romance.  What it was is that he'd say to me, you know, I can't tell you who to cheat with or whatever, 
[03:27:30]  but if you decide to cheat, please don't give them no hookerhead, because then I will  have problems.  Yes, I do blowjobs.  So anything else would be fine.  Any other kind of sex would be fine, but no hookerhead.  That would have made him jealous.  Yeah.  Wow.  She must be really good.  Yeah.  Yeah.  When you don't mind somebody having sex with your chick.  Like, you can fuck her, but just the mouth.  Keep going for it.  That's, that's good.  Do you recall your first blowjob? 
[03:28:00]  Uh, yeah.  He was a doctor, and he asked me to do it, and I didn't want to do it.  I didn't want to do it.  I didn't want to do it.  Oh.  I don't know how I can do that.  Dr. Phil.  Kevorkian.  All right, so he was, he was a doctor, and, and, uh, I guess he enjoyed it.  How did you know this doctor? 
[03:28:30]  She worked for him.  Oh, you worked?  Wow.  Look at what's going on there.  Doctor asking for blowjobs.  Yeah.  And he liked it.  I taught myself.  I, I taught myself.  Self-taught.  Yeah.  When I first, when I first started sucking his cock, I said to myself, if this was my cock,  what would I want done to it?  Wow.  And that's how I taught myself.  Wow.  So.  He was a good participant, but yeah.  So you kind of felt out what he was liking, what he didn't like, things like that. 
[03:29:00]  Yeah.  He liked maybe, uh, the spit and the hand twist.  Yeah.  He didn't like the uppercut to the balls.  You like how to, you start out really trial and error.  Yeah.  You know, let me try to bend it in half.  You know, he doesn't like that.  Remember, do not bend it in half.  Are you the ghost writer to this book?  Yes.  It says on the bottom, with Anthony Cummings. 
[03:29:30]  How many chapters is this book in half?  Well, it's not written in chapters.  It's written, you know, in numbers.  It's 69 pages.  Ah, that's good.  Of course.  69.  It's a short book.  Yeah.  Every eight inches.  That is a little pamphlet.  It's like an instruction.  It's more of an instructional book.  I wanted women to understand how cock function.  Oh, yeah?  You know, yeah.  Do you know the whole bio, you know the biology of the penis and everything?  Did you do your research?  Yes, I did have research.  So you know where all the nerve endings are and how it gets hard and all that good shit, huh? 
[03:30:00]  Wow, this is, what about, um...  Isn't sex mental?  Ah, yeah, there is a big mental aspect.  I know a guy that got arrested for eye rape.  It's real.  Eye rape.  He could rape a woman just by looking at her.  Any woman.  Really?  He could have any woman.  I thought that was a rape by Apple.  I mean, no, it has to be mental because if it wasn't...  I've got an app for that.  Yeah, if it was physical, you would enjoy being raped. 
[03:30:30]  Right.  So it has to be mental.  Yeah, yeah, it's mental.  You don't use medical, like, mental, like, real terms, like, you know, you talk dirty,  right, while you do it.  You don't say, like, other urethra.  Of course.  Of course, yeah.  I'm just teaching them the workings of a cop.  How do you protect yourself from the diseases?  Condoms.  Yeah.  Ugh.  What are those?  Yeah, exactly.  I've never heard of them.  It was nice talking to you.  The way that you do it...  Have a nice weekend.  Listen, she likes not having no condom on at all. 
[03:31:00]  Believe me.  Yeah?  Well, for sex.  Yeah, but for a blowjob, I'm not in a condom.  No, she keeps it in her mouth.  The condom?  Yes.  So you won't even feel it when it's going on.  Yeah, I always know.  Believe me.  You're talking to the kid.  I've spent a lot of money.  She's no rookie.  I don't do that without a condom.  Here's an extra hundred.  Yes, I do.  Please.  I've negotiated a lot.  I've done a lot of negotiating.  I act like that.  Oh, I've been in those negotiations so many times.  Watch that thing fly across the room like a rubber band. 
[03:31:30]  Oh, yeah.  I have to use this.  Forget it.  All right, so...  When was the last time you sucked a cock?  Oh, good question.  Thank you, Anthony.  Last cock you sucked.  Are you talking to me or my daughter?  Whoever wants to answer.  I thought it'd be disrespectful to ask your daughter in front of you, man.  Either or.  No, we're very open.  Okay.  Don't be shy.  All right, well, we'll start with Mom.  When was the last time?  Last week.  Who was it?  Last week.  A friend of mine's.  Just a friend. 
[03:32:00]  Oh, you didn't do friends.  She doesn't do friends with fat stomachs.  Sorry, Ira.  My friend's name is Ira.  Oh, I knew it was me.  Poor Ira.  Everybody in the neighborhood except for Ira.  Yeah, old dry dick.  She won't suck my cock.  So, um...  I don't look at Ira like that.  No.  Like what, a functioning male?  You're looking at a guy that is in desperate need of a blowjob, and you're the expert, and 
[03:32:30]  you won't even take care of Ira.  What's wrong with you?  No, friends don't do this.  No, friends don't let friends drive drunk.  Right.  Real friends blow each other.  Right, exactly.  You're telling yourself whatever you have to learn.  Now, what about the daughter there?  Tykesha.  Tykesha.  Tykesha.  When was the last time you fellated a man?  Fellated a man?  About four hours ago.  Oh, wow.  Really?  Ixnay on the kissing.  With this romance in the car, you ought to want her to kiss you too. 
[03:33:00]  Yeah, if it was mine, I wouldn't...  Not someone else's.  What's that?  Not someone else's.  Not someone else's.  Wait, what do you mean four hours ago?  Where?  I need details.  Was it in the building?  Yeah.  Yeah.  On the 37th floor.  No, I'm joking.  Oh, right.  Was his name Steve Blatter?  Just my voice in the car.  No wonder he got a smile on his face when he came into the car.  Yeah, exactly.  With his dumb Friday shirt.  Someone get lucky on the D train today? 
[03:33:30]  No, on the B train.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, shit.  So, four hours ago, who was it?  Was it a friend?  No.  Queens?  A guy that I'm seeing after the Stalker.  Oh, okay.  All right.  But you're not exclusive to this guy.  No.  You could play the field a little bit if you wanted to.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We're dating, but I just didn't have the time.  So, I said, I like to romance a cock.  So, I wanted to please myself.  I was a little nervous.  I love my cock romanced.  So, I said, that was going to release, you know, the nervousness. 
[03:34:00]  Yeah?  No condom with him, right?  No.  Ah, see, that's good.  Swallow?  Yeah.  Oh, what a good, what a trooper.  Good trooper.  No, we call it deep-throating.  Yeah?  I don't even, uh.  Okay.  I'm sorry.  I don't know.  We call it good egg.  As a matter of fact, in the book, I teach you how to deep-throat and also, I mean, would advance  throat fucking.  Advanced throat fucking.  Wow.  Yeah, she has three stages.  Beginners, intermediate, and advanced. 
[03:34:30]  Oh, wow.  And what, the advanced is the advanced throat fucking?  Yeah, let's go right to the advanced.  What's that about?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Let's skip.  Let's skip intermediate.  We're going to get the book.  Do you have a copy of the book, would you?  It's not read yet.  Yes.  I mean, it's not written yet.  Excuse me.  Can I see it?  She has the copy.  Can I see a copy?  I would love to.  We'll promote this.  Yeah, sure.  Can I see it?  Yeah.  That's advanced throat fucking.  There's a beginner, intermediate, and advanced throat fucking.  What's the difference between, let's say, the biggest difference between beginner and  advanced?  Asian, Italian, black. 
[03:35:00]  That's how it goes.  It looks like a movie script.  This book looks like a movie script.  Okay, fellatio, the forbidden foreplay.  It's in a binder, a plastic binder.  Wow, there's a lot of chapters here.  Introduction.  And then there's what is fellatio, the history of fellatio, which, I don't know how you,  I guess the first time a cock grew on anything, something sucked it. 
[03:35:30]  There's a picture of two amoebas waving.  Penis and mouth.  What not to do before oral sex?  What do you name there?  Besides like, wait a minute, that's you.  Don't brush your teeth and no floss.  Hold on, we're on your cycle.  Oh, because that opens your blood up, you can get more diseases?  That's your daughter.  No, that's me.  That's you?  Oh, no, that's not me.  Who's that?  Don't worry about that.  We're on your website.  What is it?  Felatioqueen?  Felatioqueen.com, yeah.  There's a picture of a very mediocre white penis bulging her cheek out. 
[03:36:00]  Jesus Christ, I could have done the stunt work for that.  She's looking for volunteers.  Oh, good.  She's a good girl.  Look at the beginning of the book, Jim.  Forward by Steve Carlesi.  Yes.  Oh, let me see that one.  There's a very, very pretty half a face and a kind of a bending up type of penis, a little  fatter.  Remember, I'm not concerned about the face.  I just need the mouth. 
[03:36:30]  That's it, huh?  Wow, Jesus.  Did you say that or did I think it?  Wow, I've lived my life like that.  Yeah, that's, wow.  Yeah, you can see what the Felatioqueen looks like.  About me.  Tells a little bit about you.  Hello, everyone.  Look at that.  It's very nice.  Any other chapters worth mentioning, Jimmy?  Well, they're all worth mentioning, I think.  Sure.  This is wonderful.  What not to do before oral sex, and again, flossing and brushing teeth, and again, that  was to keep from disease because you simulate the blood and you cut your mouth. 
[03:37:00]  Is it safe to swallow semen?  It's an excellent question.  I think most disease is killed by stomach acids, so it probably would be safe.  You know, gargling, spitting into one's own eyes, probably not recommended.  Oh, I agree.  And then, is oral sex safe?  Same thing.  Yeah, it's kind of the same thing.  It's two chapters, same title, basically.  That was actually the original dialogue in the marathon, man.  Is oral sex safe? 
[03:37:30]  It's so safe you wouldn't believe it.  All right.  Condom talk.  How to put on a condom with your mouth.  Okay.  That's probably, why do men use prostitutes?  What's that?  It's seductive.  Yes, it is.  And now, this is, why do men use prostitutes?  You should just have a photograph of Ira.  No offense, Ira, but, you know, the sit-ups are lacking.  Yeah, Ira. 
[03:38:00]  No.  And then this one is just uncircumcised cocks.  Oh.  Remember, a lot of women have never seen.  There's two kinds of cocks, uncircumcised and circumcised.  And do you do a different way to each one?  What do you prefer?  Yeah.  Do you have to do a different technique?  Yeah, well, with the uncircumcised, you have to pull the skin back.  The foreskin.  Yeah.  No, I know which skin.  Yeah.  I think you're talking about elbow skin.  Well, tighten up the elbows in there.  What do you prefer? 
[03:38:30]  It depends on the person.  Oh, yeah?  I've had both.  You're sporting a snuffleupagus or you've been circumcised?  What kind of penis do you have, Ira?  I've been circumcised.  Ah, there you go.  You got a big one, Ira?  Yes, I do.  Very proud.  Don't ask like that.  You ask how many inches?  Yeah, exactly.  It's around 100 degrees in there.  What?  In your penis?  100 degrees.  100 degrees. 
[03:39:00]  Considering body temperature is 98.6, that really is insane.  Exactly.  How big is your dick, Ira?  I can't show you.  How many inches?  You have to show me, but just tell me.  Give me a guess.  Probably about six.  That's not the answer.  Wait, you've seen his dick?  Nine inches.  You've seen his dick?  Nine inches.  You don't have a seven inch dick.  Then he's bargaining.  Seven inches.  Exactly.  Okay, I'll give it to you for six.  75 inches.  You don't deserve your dick sucked.  I'm trying to help you get a blowjob. 
[03:39:30]  Yeah, we're trying to get you a blowjob, Ira.  Jesus, the blowjob queen doesn't want to blow you.  You're talking to a pro here.  He's going to give you some pointers on how to get your dick sucked.  Exactly.  Obviously, these women aren't taking care of you.  These two won't, but...  Yeah, we'll fucking...  No, they're very, very decent people.  Friends don't do friends.  His voice is just so grating.  Oh, yeah.  You'll love it and hate it at the same time.  Your voice sounds like I feel when my dick gets bitten.  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[03:40:00]  Yeah, what about keeping the teeth off of that, right?  Uh-huh.  Now, when you were first giving that blowjob to the doctor, did you make some mistakes?  No, not really.  You were good right for the...  Because I was experimenting.  So how did you know even what to do?  What would you...  Like I said, I said to myself, if this was my cock, what would I want done to it?  Honestly, that's how I taught myself.  I think she would practice, because I used to find dildos around the house. 
[03:40:30]  Oh, really?  You suck on the dildos?  But how would you know if you were doing it right, though?  Because a dildo's not going to respond.  No matter how bad you do it, I could keep a dildo hard just by kissing it.  It doesn't matter.  Well, the dildo was made to train the uvula.  What's that?  The gag reflex.  Oh.  I thought that was another daughter.  You know, this is why Anthony is great.  I thought it.  I wasn't tasteless enough to say it. 
[03:41:00]  Let me see.  Hey, cool, you have his oral sex tape and a bunch of diseases.  You know, so you might want to skip past that chapter.  The foreskin.  What is it?  Mm-hmm.  There you go.  There's a whole page on here.  Don't laugh at my book.  I'm not laughing at all.  We're not.  We're helping you along.  You have to tease it a little bit.  You get very in-depth, because these beginning chapters are, you know, the preliminary,  and then I get to get into the sucking part.  Pictures of uncircumcised cocks.  There's one sticking straight up in the air. 
[03:41:30]  It's got a kind of a weird mollusk-like look to it.  Oh, yes.  It looks like a vernicle.  And then there's one that's limp.  It's a big-headed one with a bit of a drippy skin.  Remember, cock come in three sizes.  Soft, semi, and cock strong.  Hmm.  Cock strong.  Cock strong.  That's when you know that you're fallatialing properly.  Oh, if it's soft.  Oh, good.  Oh, there we go.  All right.  Oh, well, Troy Kwan.  No, I won't.  Okay, good.  Troy, you've got that on hand. 
[03:42:00]  I'm not doing it.  Practice a little on that?  No.  Give us a tip.  What about your daughter?  It's a clean one.  This has never been open.  Yeah, it's brand new.  Yeah.  How else are we going to learn from this?  This is a bit fatter than probably most people are.  Especially of that color.  Did you see the size of that cock?  What?  That's a cock.  That's why I'm concerned.  Did you see the size of that?  That is big.  That is a big fucking dildo.  So the problem is it's too big.  It's too big.  Why would you even say that or do that to me? 
[03:42:30]  Suggest that.  That's really huge.  So you want us to get a smaller one?  Yeah, like a nice...  You got a banana or something?  Troy, please.  Get a regular cock.  Yeah, what's wrong with you, Troy?  What are you doing, Troy?  I think it might be a damn.  That's the only one we have?  That's huge cocks.  Yeah, but Kenny might have a banana laying around.  Leave it to Steve to have that one laying around.  Of course.  There's a lot of hard dick pictures in this.  Is that good?  Yeah, a little something for everyone.  Alrighty.  Showing different sizes and positions.  Ira? 
[03:43:00]  You're not talking.  Yeah, why aren't you talking?  What's wrong with you?  It's very, very good.  This book is going to make a hit.  Now, where do people get this book?  It makes a hit.  I don't have enough for publisher.  I'm looking for a publisher.  Okay.  Well, we got some money.  What are you talking here?  How much do you need?  You know that publisher's getting his dicks up.  Yeah.  You just know it.  Yeah, I'm interested in your book.  Why don't you come down to my office? 
[03:43:30]  What kind of anus stimulation do you recommend?  Because he goes...  What kind of stimulation to the anus?  Yeah, do you stick a finger in or what?  Well, I don't teach them that right away.  That's like private lessons.  It's a little advanced.  I like my anus toyed with a little bit, to be very frank with you.  That's a part of the fourth place.  Yeah.  I like it licked a little for, you know, hygiene, of course.  That's a part.  Jimmy keeps a good clean asshole.  You have to.  It's immaculate.  You have to.  Small.  Especially if you want to.  Small. 
[03:44:00]  Ira?  Clean asshole?  Ira's asshole?  It's not a clean asshole.  I like a clean asshole.  His asshole probably smells like garbage juice.  Like, you know the stuff that leaks out of the back of the truck?  Do you think we could get E-Rock to smell Ira's asshole through the past?  Through the past.  Through the past.  I'm just asking.  Why through the past?  I'll bet you Ira does have a nice clean hiney.  E-Rock?  E-Rock, we got a job for you.  Come on.  What am I doing?  What's your name? 
[03:44:30]  Opie?  I'm Jim.  That's Paul.  That's TJ.  That's Anthony.  And that's Opie over there.  Oh, okay.  And that's Ira.  Oh, look at that.  And that's Troy.  All right, we got smaller dicks for you.  Jesus.  Where was that laying under the fucking couch?  How dirty is that?  You see all the fuss on it?  It's like a cat toy.  It's got licked on it.  She's not going to suck a fucking gulgum with lint on it.  It's brand new.  Look, it just came out of the wrapper.  It just came out of the wrapper.  You should put some water on it or put a condom on it even. 
[03:45:00]  Do we have any condoms?  What's on it, Nat?  It's purple.  I don't know.  It's a modern art.  It does.  Oh, it's from a strap-on?  Oh, it's for a strap-on.  What's that?  Are you going to publish the book if you see what I can really do?  I can't publish the book.  I mean, that's a big promise, but I could go, hey.  Hey, what happened to E-Rock?  That's what you ran around here.  You ran around here?  You ran around here?  I can go, hey.  It's good.  Yeah.  Is E-Rock smelling Ira's asshole or not?  I think he is.  I'd be happy.  Mooney's not happy. 
[03:45:30]  Why?  Why?  He's like, why did I get up this morning?  For this, he's saying it in his head over and over again.  If somebody wanted to suck the dildo, I would put it in the front of my pants.  Yeah, ma'am, would you suck Jimmy's fake dick?  It'd be nice.  We'd all have a good moment.  Yeah, we've promoted the book.  I mean, and we're not going to leave you alone.  We're going to try to get this done or at least do our part.  Because we love the Ira.  Big fans of the Ira.  We love the Ira.  Thank you, thank you.  What's the weather going to be for the weekend?  This is his expertise.  Over the weekend, it's going to be around 86 degrees under beautiful skies. 
[03:46:00]  Chance of rain on Sunday.  Around 82 degrees.  I was saying, he is every Nazi propaganda poster.  Jimmy, you want to tell Iraq why he's in here?  I need water.  I don't know if I can.  We have a condom here.  We have a condom here. 
[03:46:30]  Water.  Yeah.  Condom.  Okay, we have a new water.  Some water for the ladies, for Pete's sake.  You discard your fucking boobs.  You're actually going to watch your grandma suck this thing?  Yeah.  Jesus.  Might as well.  What about Iraq?  Iraq, I have to pee badly.  Can you guys tell Iraq what to do?  I'm going to piss my pants.  Okay.  I don't mean to ruin the sex talk.  Iraq, can you smell Iraq's asshole?  Romance your cock when you're in there, Jim.  We want to know if Iraq has a clean asshole. 
[03:47:00]  You smell it through the pants.  Smell the bag of his pants.  Smell the bag of his pants.  All right.  Iraq, can you bend over?  Bend over.  Bend over.  All right.  Iraq's bending over.  He bent over.  It was a half a degree.  He bent over.  He bent over.  I think he threw out his back.  It was...  All right.  His head moved an inch.  Is that you bending over, Ira?  Yes.  All right.  Yes.  All right.  Position.  There we go.  Now, just give a good sniff, Iraq.  Are you taping this, Sam? 
[03:47:30]  Oh, yeah.  Make sure.  Get a good one.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  There's nothing.  There's nothing there.  Yeah, you aren't down below enough.  Breathe on in.  Breathe on in.  No.  Breathe that in.  Breathe on in.  Breathe on in.  Nice.  Uh-oh.  What's the matter, Iraq?  Iraq.  You're right.  He's not going to tell you.  What's going on, Iraq?  Yeah, you get close to it.  You don't smell anything, but you get right next to it, and I don't think he's wiped in 
[03:48:00]  days.  Oh.  Oh, yes, I do.  Oh, yes, I do.  Not even I have.  Oh, yes, I do.  Ira, you wipe your ass, right?  Yes.  You don't want the world thinking that you don't.  Do you use those handy baby wipe type moist things?  No.  Well, why?  You got to keep clean back there.  Yeah, what do you do?  What do you do?  Like everybody else does.  He's probably like a one square guy.  Right.  He just takes one square and balls it up and dabs. 
[03:48:30]  Scott tissues.  Scott tissues.  An endorsement.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  That's right.  Do you rip it off Niagara Falls style, where you just grab it and a whole bunch?  Scott tissues.  What's humiliating?  Oh, no.  What's a little, the light's dim.  Oh, you're a little, um.  No, I'm not shy.  But you said humiliated.  Why are you?  I just feel like that.  That you're not taking me serious.  No, no, no. 
[03:49:00]  We are taking you serious.  We're taking you very seriously.  We are.  We're not taking Ira serious.  They are.  Yeah.  We think Ira has a dirty asshole.  And we're trying to, you know, take care of her.  We want to make sure he's cleaning up.  They have to tease a little bit.  You know what I mean?  No, we love a book on, uh.  Yeah, we like the late show.  Thank you.  Thank you.  A blowjob book?  How are we not going to like that?  Yeah, we got to make some jokes.  Because Paul doesn't feel like it anymore.  It falls out.  Oh, the lights.  You lost me about 10 minutes.  The lights have been dim.  Paul, how do you feel about this?  What?  All right.  I feel it's freedom of speech.  You can do whatever you want to do. 
[03:49:30]  You want America?  That's right.  How about we put the fucking dick in Ira's pants?  Yeah, you know what?  You want to do that, Ira?  Would you do that for Ira?  What?  That didn't sound encouraging.  If we take the dildo.  No, friends don't do friends.  Ira, you really got to.  You taught him that tabloid.  You got to really.  I know.  You really got to rethink that.  You really got to rethink that.  A midget?  No, I call him a midget.  His voice sounds like it.  Who, Pacino?  No, the only one that's always at the Carolines.  A little crazy one that talks about molesting babies. 
[03:50:00]  Voss?  Rich Voss?  Rich Voss.  No.  Ira?  I don't know.  Ira?  So if Ira puts the dildo in his pants.  I can hold it in my hand and do it.  Oh, okay.  That's it?  That's all you'll do?  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  That sounds good.  Here's a condom.  Some water for the ladies.  I don't need a condom.  Just got a condom.  Oh, okay.  Wait, she's all depressed now.  I want to see her technique.  Yeah, we just want to see her technique.  Let's see her technique.  Yeah.  I want to see this.  Big purple dildo. 
[03:50:30]  Do you want to wash her first?  Okay, nice.  She can't go down on that thing.  Wow.  My goodness.  Whoa.  Wow.  Very good.  She can get advanced deep throat.  No gag reflexes there.  That's the advanced deep throat.  Let's see.  Damn.  Did you see it?  Yeah.  We saw that.  Yeah, we sure did.  That was kind of hot.  So this is mine now.  Yeah, that's yours now.  Do you want it?  You can have it.  Yeah, take it.  Yeah.  Friends don't get friends. 
[03:51:00]  In actuality, what you're doing is making love to the cop.  Yeah.  Right.  That is what you have to do.  A lot of ladies don't know that.  They think it's a chore.  They think it's a chore.  Ira, did you see that?  That's right.  I saw it.  And you know that should be happening to you, right?  She's your friend, though.  Please say it.  Friends don't do friends.  Now, she needs a publisher. 
[03:51:30]  We understand.  We understand that.  Yeah, yeah.  Just having her on the show is going to help her cause.  I would like to publish the book.  Even you, Paul Mooney.  Even you, Paul.  Even you can publish your book.  Let's contact Hyman and Schuster.  Couldn't think of a...  Why don't you publish it?  No, I can't.  Why?  Why?  You do well at the casino. 
[03:52:00]  Yeah.  Didn't you make like a hundred bucks?  More than a hundred bucks sometimes.  You could pump out a couple of books for that.  Just pump them out as needed.  Yeah.  If someone orders one, you make one.  No.  I want to...  All right, Paul.  That ends that discussion.  She needs a publisher.  And I...  Anybody that wants to publish the book,  call up 1-888-Opie-Anthony. 
[03:52:30]  Really?  Yeah, he does.  Call up right now.  That's who's...  It just hit me.  It just hit me.  Give him a gotcha.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  It just like it.  Ira.  Ira.  Pull him.  Yeah, he does.  Yeah.  Why won't you get a blowjob from one of them?  Yeah, I don't understand why.  No, Vernon.  No, we can't do that.  Why?  Friends don't do it.  When's the last time you had your dick sucked, Ira? 
[03:53:00]  Maybe a few months or two months ago.  A few or two.  Who sucked it?  Who?  What?  Who?  Who?  She doesn't listen to this show, believe me.  Yeah.  Who sucked it?  Nana?  Who sucked it?  Lady of the Night?  Nana.  Somebody?  Lady of the Night.  A house of ill repute?  Yeah.  I sucked it.  Who sucked it?  Who sucked it?  We want to know who sucked it.  Can't say?  Can't say.  Tell us who sucked it.  Can't say or won't say.
